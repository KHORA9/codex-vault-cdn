To understand this, we must remember that art is more\r\nthe expression of the ideal than of the actual, and that men’s ideals\r\nare loftier than their practice. Castiglione gives utterance to the\r\nfinest aspirations of his time. His pages will lack interest only when\r\nmankind ceases to be interesting to man, and will reward study so long\r\nas the past shall continue to instruct the present and the future.\r\n\r\nThe few deviations that the present translator has ventured to make from\r\nthe letter of the Italian text are merely verbal, and were deemed\r\nneedful to render its meaning clear. The notes that he offers are\r\nintended to explain obscure passages and to relieve the reader from the\r\ntedium of searching in books of reference. Perhaps no one will regard it\r\nas inopportune to be reminded of what all may have known but few are\r\nable to remember with precision. Students who may wish to learn from\r\nwhat Greek and Latin sources Castiglione derived material are referred\r\nto Professor Vittorio Cian’s admirable edition.\r\n\r\nThe translator desires to express his thanks for the friendly\r\nencouragement that he has received from Miss Grace Norton, at whose\r\nsuggestion his task was undertaken. He is indebted to Dr. Luigi Roversi\r\nand Signor Leopoldo Jung for their patient aid, and to Signor Alessandro\r\nLuzio and many other scholars, in Italy and elsewhere, for the kindness\r\nwith which they have helped him to gather portraits and bibliographical\r\ndata. He gratefully acknowledges, also, his frequent use of Professor\r\nCian’s erudite labours, of John Addington Symonds’s RENAISSANCE IN\r\nITALY, and of James Dennistoun’s MEMOIRS OF THE DUKES OF URBINO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n   (The Arabic numerals given below refer to the numbered paragraphs\r\n       into which it has long been customary to divide the work)\r\n\r\n                                                                    Page\r\n LIST OF PLATES                                                       xi\r\n INTERLOCUTORS                                                       xiv\r\n THE AUTHOR’S DEDICATORY LETTER                                        1\r\n Reasons for writing the book, and for at first delaying and\r\n afterwards hastening its publication. Lament at the recent\r\n death of several persons mentioned in the book. Answer to three\r\n objections: that the book was not written in the language of\r\n Boccaccio; that, as it is impossible to find a perfect\r\n Courtier, it was superfluous to describe one; and that the\r\n author presumed to paint his own portrait.\r\n THE FIRST BOOK OF THE COURTIER                                        7\r\n 1: The book written at the instance of Alfonso Ariosto and in\r\n dialogue form, in order to record certain discussions held at\r\n the court of Urbino. 2-3: Description and praise of Urbino and\r\n its lords; Duke Federico and his son Guidobaldo. 4-5: The\r\n Urbino court and the persons taking part in the discussions. 6:\r\n Circumstances that led to the discussions; visit of Pope Julius\r\n II. 7-11: Various games proposed. 12: Game finally chosen: to\r\n describe a perfect Courtier. 13-6: Canossa begins the\r\n discussion by enumerating some of the conditions essential to\r\n the Courtier,—especially gentle birth. 17-8: Arms the true\r\n profession of the Courtier, who must, however, avoid arrogance\r\n and boasting. 19-22: Physical qualities and martial exercises.\r\n 23: Short bantering digression. 24-6: Grace. 27-8: Affectation.\r\n 29-39: Literary and conversational style. 40: Women’s\r\n affectations. 41: Moral qualities. 42-6: Literary\r\n accomplishments; arms vs. letters. 47-8: Music. 49: Painting.\r\n 50-3: Painting vs. sculpture. 54-6: Arrival of the youthful\r\n Francesco Maria della Rovere; the evening’s entertainment ends\r\n with dancing.\r\n THE SECOND BOOK OF THE COURTIER                                      75\r\n 1-4: Reasons why the aged are wont to laud the past and to\r\n decry the present; defence of the present against such\r\n aspersions; praise of the court of Urbino. 5-6 Federico Fregoso\r\n begins the discussion on the way and time of employing the\r\n qualities and accomplishments described by Canossa: utility of\r\n such discussion. 7-8: General rules: to avoid affectation, to\r\n speak and act discreetly and opportunely, to aim at honour and\r\n praise in martial exercises, war, and public contests, 9-10:\r\n Other physical exercises. 11: Dancing and masquerading. 12-3:\r\n Music of various kinds, when to be practised. 14: Aged\r\n Courtiers not to engage publicly in music and dancing. 15-6:\r\n Duty of aged and youthful Courtiers to moderate the faults\r\n peculiar to their years. 17-25: Conversation, especially with\r\n superiors; how to win favours worthily. 26-8: Dress and\r\n ornament; lamentable lack of fashions peculiarly Italian.\r\n 29-30: Choice and treatment of friends. 31: Games of cards and\r\n chess. 32-5: Influence of preconceived opinions and first\r\n impressions; advantage of being preceded by good reputation.\r\n 36: Danger of going beyond bounds in the effort to be amusing.\r\n 37: French and Spanish manners. 38: Tact, modesty, kindness,\r\n readiness; taking advantage of opportunities; confession of\r\n ignorance. 39-41: Self-depreciation, deceit, moderation. 42-83:\r\n Pleasantries and witticisms expounded by Bibbiena. 84-97:\r\n Practical jokes; to be used discreetly, particularly where\r\n women are concerned; use of trickery and artifice in love;\r\n dignity and nobility of women. 98-100: Giuliano de’Medici\r\n chosen to describe the perfect Court Lady.\r\n THE THIRD BOOK OF THE COURTIER                                      171\r\n 1: Excellence of the court of Urbino to be estimated in much\r\n the same way in which Pythagoras calculated the stature of\r\n Hercules. 2-3: Bantering preliminaries to the discussion on the\r\n Court Lady. 4: Qualities common to the Courtier and to the\r\n Court Lady. 5-6: The Court Lady to be affable, modest and\r\n decorous;

And as the recollection of Duke\r\nGuido’s character was fresh in my mind, and the delight I had during\r\nthose years in the kind companionship of the notable persons who at that\r\ntime frequented the Court of Urbino, I was moved by their memory to\r\nwrite these books of the Courtier, which I did in a few days,[4]\r\npurposing in time to correct those errours that arose from the wish to\r\npay this debt speedily. But for many years past fortune has burdened me\r\nwith toil so constant that I never could find leisure to make the book\r\nsuch as would content even my poor judgment.\r\n\r\nNow being in Spain,[5] and learning from Italy that my lady Vittoria\r\ndella Colonna, Marchioness of Pescara,[6] to whom I gave a copy of the\r\nbook, had against her word caused a large part of it to be transcribed,\r\nI could not but feel some annoyance, fearing the many inconveniences\r\nthat may befall in such cases. Still, I relied upon the wit and good\r\nsense of this lady (whose character I have always held in veneration as\r\na thing divine) to prevent any mischief coming to me from having obeyed\r\nher wishes. Finally I was informed that this part of the book was in the\r\nhands of many people at Naples; and as men are always eager for anything\r\nnew, it seemed likely that someone might try to have it printed.[7]\r\nAlarmed at this peril, then, I resolved to revise the book at once so\r\nfar as I had time, with intent to publish it; for I thought better to\r\nlet it be seen imperfectly corrected by my own hand than grievously\r\nmutilated by the hand of others.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to carry out this plan, I began to read the book again; and\r\ntouched at the very outset by the title, I was saddened not a little,\r\nand far more so as I went on, by the thought that most of the personages\r\nintroduced in the discussion were already dead; for besides those\r\nmentioned in the proem of the last Book, messer Alfonso Ariosto[8] (to\r\nwhom the work is dedicated) is also dead, a gracious youth, considerate,\r\nof the highest breeding, and apt in everything proper to a man who lives\r\nat court. Likewise Duke Giuliano de’ Medici,[9] whose kindness and noble\r\ncourtesy deserved to be enjoyed longer by the world. Messer\r\nBernardo,[10] Cardinal of Santa Maria in Portico, who for his keen and\r\nplayful readiness of wit was most delightful to all that knew him, he,\r\ntoo, is dead. Dead also is my lord Ottaviano Fregoso,[11] a man very\r\nrare in our times: magnanimous, devout, full of kindness, talent, good\r\nsense, and courtesy, a true lover of honour and merit, and so worthy of\r\npraise that his very enemies were ever forced to praise him; and the\r\nmisadventures that he bore so bravely were enough to prove that fortune\r\nis still, as always, adverse to merit. And of those mentioned in my book\r\nmany more besides are dead, to whom nature seemed to promise very long\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut what should not be told without tears is that my lady Duchess,[12]\r\ntoo, is dead. And if my heart mourns the loss of so many friends and\r\npatrons, who have left me in this life as in a solitude full of sorrows,\r\nit is meet that I grieve more bitterly for the death of my lady Duchess\r\nthan of all the others; for she was more precious than they, and I more\r\nbound to her than to all the others. Not to delay, then, the tribute\r\nthat I owe the memory of so excellent a Lady and of the others who are\r\nno more, and moved also by the danger to my book, I have had it printed\r\nand published in such state as the shortness of time permitted.\r\n\r\nAnd since you had no knowledge in their lifetime either of my lady\r\nDuchess or of the others who are dead (except Duke Giuliano and the\r\nCardinal of Santa Maria in Portico), in order to give you that knowledge\r\nafter their death as far as I can, I send you this book as a picture of\r\nthe Court of Urbino, not by the hand of Raphael[98] or Michelangelo,[99]\r\nbut of a humble painter, who knows only how to trace the chief lines,\r\nand cannot adorn truth with bright colouring, or by perspective art make\r\nthat which is not seem to be. And although I tried to show forth in\r\ntheir discourse the qualities and character of my personages, I own I\r\nfailed to express or even to suggest the excellences of my lady Duchess,\r\nnot only because my style is inadequate to describe them, but because my\r\nintelligence fails even to conceive of them;[13] and if I be censured\r\nfor this or any other matter worthy of censure (for I well know that my\r\nbook contains many such), I shall not gainsay the truth.\r\n\r\n2.—But as men sometimes so delight in finding fault that they reprehend\r\neven that which does not merit reprehension, to such as blame me because\r\nI did not imitate Boccaccio[14] or conform to the usages of present\r\nTuscan speech, I shall not refrain from saying that while, for his time,\r\nBoccaccio had a charming faculty and often wrote with care and\r\ndiligence, yet he wrote far better when he followed only the guidance of\r\nhis natural wit and instinct, without further thought or care to polish\r\nhis writings, than when he strove industriously and laboriously to be\r\nmore refined and correct. For this reason even his followers declare\r\nthat he greatly erred in judgment concerning his own works, holding\r\ncheap what did him honour[15] and prizing what was worthless. Therefore,\r\nif I had imitated that manner of writing which in Boccaccio is censured\r\nby those who elsewise praise him, I should not have been able to escape\r\nthose same aspersions that were cast on him in this regard; and I should\r\nhave more deserved them, because he committed his faults thinking he was\r\ndoing well, while I should have known I was doing ill. Again, if I had\r\nimitated the style now admired by many but less esteemed by him, it\r\nseemed to me that by such imitation I should show myself at variance\r\nwith him whom I was imitating, a thing I deemed unseemly. And again, if\r\nthis consideration had not moved me, I was not able to imitate him in my\r\nsubject-matter, for he never wrote anything at all in the manner of\r\nthese books of the Courtier; and I thought I ought not to imitate him in\r\nlanguage, because the power and true law of good speech consist rather\r\nin usage than in aught else, and it is always a bad habit to employ\r\nwords not in use. Therefore it was not meet for me to borrow many of\r\nBoccaccio’s words that were used in his day, but are not now used even\r\nby the Tuscans themselves.\r\n\r\nNor was I willing to limit myself to the Tuscan usage of to-day, because\r\nintercourse between different nations has always had the effect to\r\ntransport, as it were like merchandise, new forms of speech from one to\r\nthe other; and these endure or fail according as custom accepts or\r\nrejects them. Besides being attested by the ancients, this is clearly\r\nseen in Boccaccio, who used so many French, Spanish, and Provençal words\r\n(some of them perhaps not very intelligible to modern Tuscans) that if\r\nthey were all omitted his work would be far shorter.\r\n\r\nAnd since, in my opinion, we ought not to despise the idiom of the other\r\nnoble cities of Italy, whither men resort who are wise, witty, and\r\neloquent, wont to discourse on weighty matters of statecraft, letters,\r\nwar, and commerce, I think that, of the words used in the speech of\r\nthese places, I could fitly use in writing such as are graceful in\r\nthemselves, elegant to pronounce, and commonly deemed good and\r\nexpressive, although they might not be Tuscan or even of Italian origin.\r\nMoreover, in Tuscany, many words are used which are plainly corruptions\r\nof the Latin, but which in Lombardy and other parts of Italy have\r\nremained pure and unchanged, and are so generally employed by everyone\r\nthat they are accepted by the gentle and easily understood by the\r\nvulgar. Hence I think I did not err if in writing I used some of these\r\nwords, or preferred what is whole and true speech of my own country\r\nrather than what is corrupt and mutilated from abroad.\r\n\r\nNeither do I regard as sound the maxim laid down by many, that our\r\ncommon speech is the more beautiful the less it is like Latin; nor do I\r\nunderstand why one fashion of speech should be accorded so much greater\r\nauthority than another, that, if the Tuscan tongue can ennoble debased\r\nand mutilated Latin words and lend them such grace that, mutilated as\r\nthey are, they may be used by anyone without reproach (which is not\r\ndenied), the Lombard or any other tongue may not support these same\r\nLatin words, pure, whole, precise, and quite unchanged, so that they be\r\ntolerable. And truly, just as to undertake, in spite of usage, to coin\r\nnew words or to preserve old ones may be called bold presumption, so\r\nalso, besides being difficult, it seems almost impious to undertake,\r\nagainst the force of that same usage, to suppress and bury alive, as it\r\nwere, words that have already endured for many centuries, protected by\r\nthe shield of custom against the envy of time, and have maintained their\r\ndignity and splendour through the changes in language, in buildings, in\r\nhabits and in customs, wrought by the wars and disasters of Italy.\r\n\r\nHence if in writing I have chosen not to use those words of Boccaccio\r\nthat are no longer used in Tuscany, nor to conform to the rule of those\r\nwho deem it not permissible to use any words that the Tuscans of to-day\r\ndo not use, I seem to myself excusable. And I think that both in the\r\nmatter and in the language of my book (so far as one language can aid\r\nanother), I have followed authors as worthy of praise as is Boccaccio.\r\nNor do I believe that it ought to be counted against me as a fault that\r\nI have elected to make myself known rather as a Lombard speaking\r\nLombard, than as a non-Tuscan speaking Tuscan too precisely, in order\r\nthat I might not resemble Theophrastus, who was detected as non-Athenian\r\nby a simple old woman, because he spoke the Athenian dialect with excess\r\nof care.[16]\r\n\r\nBut as this subject is sufficiently treated of in my first Book,[17] I\r\nshall say no more, except that, to prevent all possible discussion, I\r\ngrant my critics that I do not know this Tuscan dialect of theirs, which\r\nis so difficult and recondite. And I declare that I have written in my\r\nown dialect, just as I speak and for those who speak as I do; and in\r\nthis I think I have wronged no man, because it seems to me that no one\r\nis forbidden to write and speak in his own language; nor is anyone bound\r\nto read or listen to what does not please him. Therefore if these folk\r\ndo not care to read my Courtier, I shall not hold myself in the least\r\nwronged by them.\r\n\r\n3.—Others say that since it is so very hard and well nigh impossible to\r\nfind a man as perfect as I wish the Courtier to be, it was superfluous\r\nto write of him, because it is folly to teach what cannot be learned. To\r\nthese I make answer that I am content to have erred in company with\r\nPlato, Xenophon and Marcus Tullius, leaving on one side all discussion\r\nabout the Intelligible World and Ideals; among which, just as are\r\nincluded (according to those authors) the ideal of the perfect State, of\r\nthe perfect King and of the perfect Orator,[18] so also is the ideal of\r\nthe perfect Courtier. And if in my style I have failed to approach the\r\nimage of this ideal, it will be so much the easier for courtiers to\r\napproach in deeds the aim and goal that I have set them by my writing;\r\nand even if they fail to attain the perfection, such as it is, that I\r\nhave tried to express, he that approaches nearest to it will be the most\r\nperfect; just as when many archers shoot at a target and none hit the\r\nvery mark, surely he that comes nearest to it is better than the rest.\r\n\r\nStill others say that I thought to paint my own portrait, as if I were\r\nconvinced that I possessed all the qualities that I attribute to the\r\nCourtier.[19] To these I shall not indeed deny having essayed everything\r\nthat I should wish the Courtier to know; and I think that a man, however\r\nlearned, who did not know something of the matters treated of in the\r\nbook, could not well have written of them; but I am not so lacking in\r\nself-discernment as to fancy that I know everything I have the wit to\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nMy defence then against these and perhaps many other accusations, I\r\nleave for the present to the verdict of public opinion; for while the\r\nmany may not perfectly understand, yet oftener than not they scent by\r\nnatural instinct the savour of good and bad, and without being able to\r\nexplain why, they relish one thing and like it, and reject another and\r\nhate it. Therefore if my book wins general favour, I shall think it must\r\nbe good and ought to live;[20] but if it fails to please, I shall think\r\nit must be bad and soon to be forgot. And if my censors be not satisfied\r\nwith the common verdict of opinion, let them rest content with that of\r\ntime, which in the end reveals the hidden defects of everything, and\r\nbeing father of truth and judge without passion, ever passes on men’s\r\nwritings just sentence of life or death.\r\n\r\n                                               BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE FIRST BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n                     BY COUNT BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n                       TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO\r\n\r\n\r\n1.—Within myself I have long doubted, dearest messer Alfonso, which of\r\ntwo things were the harder for me: to deny you what you have often\r\nbegged of me so urgently, or to do it. For while it seemed to me very\r\nhard to deny anything (and especially a thing in the highest degree\r\nlaudable) to one whom I love most dearly and by whom I feel myself to be\r\nmost dearly loved, yet to set about an enterprise that I was not sure of\r\nbeing able to finish, seemed to me ill befitting a man who esteems just\r\ncensure as it ought to be esteemed. At last, after much thought, I am\r\nresolved to try in this matter how much aid my assiduity may gain from\r\nthat affection and intense desire to please, which in other things are\r\nso wont to stimulate the industry of man.\r\n\r\nYou ask me then to write what is to my thinking the form of\r\nCourtiership[21] most befitting a gentleman who lives at the court of\r\nprinces, by which he may have the ability and knowledge perfectly to\r\nserve them in every reasonable thing, winning from them favour, and\r\npraise from other men; in short, what manner of man he ought to be who\r\nmay deserve to be called a perfect Courtier without flaw. Wherefore,\r\nconsidering your request, I say that had it not seemed to me more\r\nblameworthy to be reputed somewhat unamiable by you than too conceited\r\nby everyone else, I should have avoided this task, for fear of being\r\nheld over bold by all who know how hard a thing it is, from among such a\r\nvariety of customs as are in use at the courts of Christendom, to choose\r\nthe perfect form and as it were the flower of Courtiership. For custom\r\noften makes the same thing pleasing and displeasing to us; whence it\r\nsometimes follows that customs, habits, ceremonies and fashions that\r\nonce were prized, become vulgar, and contrariwise the vulgar become\r\nprized. Thus it is clearly seen that use rather than reason has power to\r\nintroduce new things among us, and to do away with the old; and he will\r\noften err who seeks to determine which are perfect. Therefore being\r\nconscious of this and many other difficulties in the subject set before\r\nme to write of, I am constrained to offer some apology, and to testify\r\nthat this errour (if errour it may indeed be called) is common to us\r\nboth, to the end that if I be blamed for it, the blame maybe shared by\r\nyou also; for your offence in setting me a task beyond my powers should\r\nnot be deemed less than mine in having accepted it.\r\n\r\nSo now let us make a beginning of our subject, and if possible let us\r\nform such a Courtier that any prince worthy to be served by him,\r\nalthough of but small estate,[22] might still be called a very great\r\nlord.\r\n\r\nIn these books we shall follow no fixed order or rule of distinct\r\nprecepts, such as are usually employed in teaching anything whatever;\r\nbut after the fashion of many ancient writers, we shall revive a\r\npleasant memory and rehearse certain discussions that were held between\r\nmen singularly competent in such matters; and although I had no part in\r\nthem personally, being in England at the time they took place,[23] yet\r\nhaving received them soon after my return, from one who faithfully\r\nreported them to me, I will try to recall them as accurately as my\r\nmemory will permit, so that you may know what was thought and believed\r\non this subject by men who are worthy of highest praise, and to whose\r\njudgment implicit faith may be given in all things. Nor will it be amiss\r\nto tell the cause of these discussions, so that we may reach in orderly\r\nmanner the end to which our discourse tends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GUIDOBALDO DI MONTEFELTRO\r\n  DUKE OF URBINO\r\n  1472-1508\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom Alinari’s photograph (no. 7351) of the portrait, in the Colonna\r\n    Gallery at Rome, variously attributed to Raphael’s father, Giovanni\r\n    Santi (1440?-1494), and (by Morelli) to Melozzo degli Ambrosi da\r\n    Forli (1438-1494). Schmarzow’s iconographical identification of this\r\n    portrait (formerly supposed to represent Raphael as a boy) is\r\n    confirmed by its close resemblance to the young duke’s features as\r\n    shown on coins issued in the early years of his reign.\r\n\r\n2.—On the slopes of the Apennines towards the Adriatic sea, almost in\r\nthe centre of Italy, there lies (as everyone knows) the little city of\r\nUrbino. Although amid mountains, and less pleasing ones than perhaps\r\nsome others that we see in many places, it has yet enjoyed such favour\r\nof heaven that the country round about is very fertile and rich in\r\ncrops; so that besides the wholesomeness of the air, there is great\r\nabundance of everything needful for human life. But among the greatest\r\nblessings that can be attributed to it, this I believe to be the chief,\r\nthat for a long time it has ever been ruled by the best of lords;[24]\r\nalthough in the calamities of the universal wars of Italy, it was for a\r\nseason deprived of them.[25] But without seeking further, we can give\r\ngood proof of this by the glorious memory of Duke Federico,[26] who in\r\nhis day was the light of Italy; nor is there lack of credible and\r\nabundant witnesses, who are still living, to his prudence, humanity,\r\njustice, liberality, unconquered courage,—and to his military\r\ndiscipline, which is conspicuously attested by his numerous victories,\r\nhis capture of impregnable places, the sudden swiftness of his\r\nexpeditions, the frequency with which he put to flight large and\r\nformidable armies by means of a very small force, and by his loss of no\r\nsingle battle whatever;[27] so that we may not unreasonably compare him\r\nto many famous men of old.\r\n\r\nAmong his other praiseworthy deeds, he built on the rugged site of\r\nUrbino a palace regarded by many as the most beautiful to be found in\r\nall Italy; and he so well furnished it with everything suitable that it\r\nseemed not a palace but a city in the form of a palace; and not merely\r\nwith what is ordinarily used,—such as silver vases, hangings of richest\r\ncloth-of-gold and silk, and other similar things,—but for ornament he\r\nadded countless antique statues in marble and bronze, pictures most\r\nchoice, and musical instruments of every sort, nor would he admit\r\nanything there that was not very rare and excellent. Then at very great\r\ncost he collected a goodly number of most excellent and rare books in\r\nGreek, Latin and Hebrew, all of which he adorned with gold and with\r\nsilver, esteeming this to be the chiefest excellence of his great\r\npalace.[28]\r\n\r\n3.—Following then the course of nature, and already sixty-five years\r\nold,[29] he died gloriously, as he had lived; and he left as his\r\nsuccessor a motherless little boy of ten years, his only son Guidobaldo.\r\nHeir to the State, he seemed to be heir also to all his father’s\r\nvirtues, and soon his noble nature gave such promise as seemed not\r\npermissible to hope for from mortal man; so that men esteemed none among\r\nthe notable deeds of Duke Federico to be greater than to have begotten\r\nsuch a son. But envious of so much virtue, fortune thwarted this\r\nglorious beginning with all her power; so that before Duke Guido reached\r\nthe age of twenty years, he fell ill of the gout,[30] which grew upon\r\nhim with grievous pain, and in a short space of time so crippled all his\r\nmembers that he could neither stand upon his feet nor move; and thus one\r\nof the fairest and most promising forms in the world was distorted and\r\nspoiled in tender youth.\r\n\r\nAnd not content even with this, fortune was so contrary to him in all\r\nhis purposes, that he could seldom carry into effect anything that he\r\ndesired; and although he was very wise of counsel and unconquered in\r\nspirit, it seemed that what he undertook, both in war and in everything\r\nelse whether small or great, always ended ill for him. And proof of this\r\nis found in his many and diverse calamities, which he ever bore with\r\nsuch strength of mind, that his spirit was never vanquished by fortune;\r\nnay, scorning her assaults with unbroken courage, he lived in illness as\r\nif in health and in adversity as if fortunate, with perfect dignity and\r\nuniversal esteem; so that although he was thus infirm of body, he fought\r\nwith most honourable rank in the service of their Serene Highnesses the\r\nKings of Naples, Alfonso[31] and Ferdinand the Younger;[32] later with\r\nPope Alexander VI,[33] and with the Venetian and Florentine signories.\r\n\r\nUpon the accession of Julius II[34] to the pontificate, he was made\r\nCaptain of the Church; at which time, following his accustomed habit,\r\nabove all else he took care to fill his household with very noble and\r\nvaliant gentlemen, with whom he lived most familiarly, delighting in\r\ntheir intercourse: wherein the pleasure he gave to others was not less\r\nthan that he received from others, he being well versed in both the\r\n[learned][35] languages, and uniting affability and pleasantness[36] to\r\na knowledge of things without number. And besides this, the greatness of\r\nhis spirit so set him on, that although he could not practise in person\r\nthe exercises of chivalry, as he once had done, yet he took the utmost\r\npleasure in witnessing them in others; and by his words, now correcting\r\nnow praising every man according to desert, he clearly showed his\r\njudgment in those matters; wherefore, in jousts and tournaments, in\r\nriding, in the handling of every sort of weapon, as well as in pastimes,\r\ngames, music,—in short, in all the exercises proper to noble\r\ncavaliers,—everyone strove so to show himself, as to merit being deemed\r\nworthy of such noble fellowship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EMILIA PIA\r\n  Died 1528\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a photograph, specially made by Mansell, of a cast, kindly\r\n    furnished by T. Whitcombe Greene, Esq., of a medal in his collection\r\n    at Chandler’s Ford, Hampshire, possibly the work of Giancristoforo\r\n    Romano (1465?-1512). See Armand’s _Les Médailleurs Italiens_, iii,\r\n    202.\r\n\r\n4.—Thus all the hours of the day were assigned to honourable and\r\npleasant exercises as well for the body as for the mind; but since my\r\nlord Duke was always wont by reason of his infirmity to retire to sleep\r\nvery early after supper, everyone usually betook himself at that hour to\r\nthe presence of my lady Duchess, Elisabetta Gonzaga; where also was ever\r\nto be found my lady Emilia Pia,[37] who was endowed with such lively wit\r\nand judgment that, as you know, it seemed as if she were the Mistress of\r\nus all, and as if everyone gained wisdom and worth from her. Here then,\r\ngentle discussions and innocent pleasantries were heard, and on the face\r\nof everyone a jocund gaiety was seen depicted, so that the house could\r\ntruly be called the very abode of mirth: nor ever elsewhere, I think,\r\nwas so relished, as once was here, how great sweetness may flow from\r\ndear and cherished companionship; for not to speak of the honour it was\r\nto each of us to serve such a lord as he of whom I have just spoken,\r\nthere was born in the hearts of all a supreme contentment every time we\r\ncame into the presence of my lady Duchess; and it seemed as if this were\r\na chain that held us all linked in love, so that never was concord of\r\nwill or cordial love between brothers greater than that which here was\r\nbetween us all.\r\n\r\nThe same was it among the ladies, with whom there was intercourse most\r\nfree and honourable; for everyone was permitted to talk, sit, jest and\r\nlaugh with whom he pleased; but such was the reverence paid to the wish\r\nof my lady Duchess, that this same liberty was a very great check;[38]\r\nnor was there anyone who did not esteem it the utmost pleasure he could\r\nhave in the world, to please her, and the utmost pain to displease her.\r\nAnd thus, most decorous manners were here joined with greatest liberty,\r\nand games and laughter in her presence were seasoned not only with witty\r\njests, but with gracious and sober dignity; for that modesty and\r\nloftiness which governed all the acts, words and gestures of my lady\r\nDuchess, bantering and laughing, were such that she would have been\r\nknown for a lady of noblest rank by anyone who saw her even but once.\r\nAnd impressing herself thus upon those about her, she seemed to attune\r\nus all to her own quality and tone; accordingly every man strove to\r\nfollow this pattern, taking as it were a rule of beautiful behaviour\r\nfrom the presence of so great and virtuous a lady; whose highest\r\nqualities I do not now purpose to recount, they not being my theme and\r\nbeing well known to all the world, and far more because I could not\r\nexpress them with either tongue or pen; and those that perhaps might\r\nhave been somewhat hid, fortune, as if wondering at such rare virtue,\r\nchose to reveal through many adversities and stings of calamity, so as\r\nto give proof that in the tender breast of woman, in company with\r\nsingular beauty, there may abide prudence and strength of soul, and all\r\nthose virtues that even among stern men are very rare.[39]\r\n\r\n5.—But leaving this aside, I say that the custom of all the gentlemen of\r\nthe house was to betake themselves straightway after supper to my lady\r\nDuchess; where, among the other pleasant pastimes and music and dancing\r\nthat continually were practised, sometimes neat questions were proposed,\r\nsometimes ingenious games were devised at the choice of one or another,\r\nin which under various disguises the company disclosed their thoughts\r\nfiguratively to whom they liked best. Sometimes other discussions arose\r\nabout different matters, or biting retorts passed lightly back and\r\nforth. Often “devices” (_imprese_), as we now call them, were\r\ndisplayed;[40] in discussing which there was wonderful diversion, the\r\nhouse being (as I have said) full of very noble talents; among whom (as\r\nyou know) the most famous were my lord Ottaviano Fregoso, his brother\r\nmesser Federico,[41] the Magnifico Giuliano de’ Medici, messer Pietro\r\nBembo,[42] messer Cesare Gonzaga,[43] Count Ludovico da Canossa,[44] my\r\nlord Gaspar Pallavicino,[45] my lord Ludovico Pio,[46] my lord Morello\r\nda Ortona,[47] Pietro da Napoli, messer Roberto da Bari,[48] and\r\ncountless other very noble cavaliers. Moreover there were many, who,\r\nalthough usually they did not dwell there constantly, yet spent most of\r\nthe time there: like messer Bernardo Bibbiena, the Unico Aretino,[49]\r\nGiancristoforo Romano,[50] Pietro Monte,[51] Terpandro,[52] messer\r\nNiccolò Frisio;[53] so that there always flocked thither poets,\r\nmusicians and all sorts of agreeable[54] men, and in every walk the most\r\nexcellent that were to be found in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ELISABETTA GONZAGA\r\n  DUCHESS OF URBINO\r\n  1471-1526\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 41.121) of the portrait in the\r\n    Uffizi Gallery at Florence, variously ascribed to Andrea Mantegna\r\n    (1431-1506), to Lorenzo Costa (1460-1535), and to Francesco\r\n    Bonsignori (1455-1519).\r\n\r\n6.—Now Pope Julius II, having by his presence and the aid of the French\r\nbrought Bologna under subjection to the apostolic see in the year 1506,\r\nand being on his way back to Rome, passed through Urbino; where he was\r\nreceived with all possible honour and with as magnificent and splendid\r\nstate as could have been prepared in any other noble city of Italy: so\r\nthat besides the pope, all the lord cardinals and other courtiers were\r\nmost highly gratified. And some there were, attracted by the charm of\r\nthis society, who tarried at Urbino many days after the departure of the\r\npope and his court; during which time not only were the ordinary\r\npastimes and diversions continued in the usual manner, but every man\r\nstrove to contribute something new, and especially in the games, to\r\nwhich almost every evening was devoted. And the order of them was such\r\nthat immediately after reaching the presence of my lady Duchess,\r\neveryone sat down in a circle as he pleased or as chance decided; and in\r\nsitting they were arranged alternately, a man and a woman, as long as\r\nthere were women, for nearly always the number of men was by far the\r\ngreater; then they were governed as seemed best to my lady Duchess, who\r\nfor the most part left this charge to my lady Emilia.\r\n\r\nSo, the day after the pope’s departure,[55] the company being assembled\r\nat the wonted hour and place, after much pleasant talk, my lady Duchess\r\ndesired my lady Emilia to begin the games; and she, after having for a\r\ntime refused the task, spoke thus:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, since it pleases you that I shall be the one to begin the\r\ngames this evening, not being able in reason to fail to obey you, I will\r\npropose a game in which I think I ought to have little blame and less\r\nlabour; and this shall be for everyone to propose after his liking a\r\ngame that has never been given; and then we will choose the one that\r\nseems best worthy to be played in this company.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, she turned to my lord Gaspar Pallavicino, requiring him\r\nto tell his choice; and he at once replied:\r\n\r\n“It is for you, my Lady, first to tell your own.”\r\n\r\n“But I have already told it,” said my lady Emilia; “now do you, my lady\r\nDuchess, bid him be obedient.”[56]\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said, smiling:\r\n\r\n“To the end that everyone may be bound to obey you, I make you my deputy\r\nand give you all my authority.”\r\n\r\n7.—“It is a remarkable thing,” replied my lord Gaspar, “that women\r\nshould always be allowed this exemption from toil, and it certainly\r\nwould not be unreasonable to wish in some way to learn the reason why;\r\nbut not to be the first to disobey, I will leave this for another time,\r\nand will tell what is required of me;” and he began: “It seems to me\r\nthat in love, as in everything else, our minds judge diversely; and thus\r\nit often happens that what is very delightful to one man, is very\r\nhateful to another; but none the less we all are ever alike in this,\r\nthat every man holds his beloved very dear; so that the over fondness of\r\nlovers often cheats their judgment to such a degree, that they esteem\r\nthe person whom they love to be the only one in the world adorned with\r\nevery excellent virtue and wholly without defect; but since human nature\r\ndoes not admit such complete perfection, and since there is no one to be\r\nfound who does not lack something, it cannot be said that such men do\r\nnot cheat themselves, and that the lover does not become blind\r\nconcerning the beloved. I would therefore that this evening our game\r\nmight be that each of us should tell what virtue above others he would\r\nhave the person whom he loves adorned with; and then, as all must have\r\nsome blemish, what fault he would have in her; in order that we may see\r\nwho can find the most praiseworthy and useful virtues, and the most\r\nexcusable faults and least harmful to lover and beloved.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar having spoken thus, my lady Emilia made sign to madonna\r\nCostanza Fregosa[57] to follow after, because she sat next in order, and\r\nshe was preparing to speak; but my lady Duchess said quickly:\r\n\r\n“Since my lady Emilia will not make the effort to invent a game, it were\r\nonly fair that the other ladies share this ease and that they too be\r\nexempt from such exertion for this evening, especially as there are here\r\nso many men that there is no danger of lack of games.”\r\n\r\n“So be it,” replied my lady Emilia; and imposing silence on madonna\r\nCostanza, she turned to messer Cesare Gonzaga, who sat next, and bade\r\nhim speak; and he began thus:\r\n\r\n8.—“Whoso will carefully consider all our actions, will ever find\r\nvarious defects in them; the reason whereof is that nature, variable in\r\nthis as in other things, has given to one man the light of reason in one\r\nthing, to another man in another thing; and so it happens that, the one\r\nknowing what the other does not know and being ignorant of what the\r\nother understands, each readily perceives his neighbour’s fault and not\r\nhis own, and we all seem to ourselves very wise and perhaps most of all\r\nin that wherein we most are foolish. Thus we have seen it happen in this\r\nhouse that many, at first accounted very wise, were in course of time\r\nrecognized as very foolish, which came about from nothing else but our\r\nown watchfulness. For, as they say that in Apulia musical instruments\r\nare used for those bitten by the tarantula,[58] and various tunes are\r\ntried until the humour that causes the malady (through a certain\r\naffinity it has for some one of those tunes) is suddenly stirred by the\r\nsound, and so excites the sick man that he is restored to health by\r\nvirtue of that excitement: so when we have perceived a hidden touch of\r\nfolly, we have stimulated it so artfully and with such various\r\npersuasions and diverse means, that at length we have learned whither it\r\ntended; then, the humour once recognized, so well have we excited it\r\nthat it has always reached the perfection of open folly. Thus one man\r\nhas waxed foolish over poetry, another over music, another over love,\r\nanother over dancing, another over inventing mimes,[59] another over\r\nriding, another over fencing,—each according to the native quality of\r\nhis metal; whence, as you know, great amusement has been derived. I hold\r\nit then as certain that there is some grain of folly in each of us,\r\nwhich being quickened can multiply almost infinitely.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I would that this evening our game might be a discussion upon\r\nthis subject, and that each one tell with what kind of folly, and about\r\nwhat thing, he thinks I should make a fool of myself if I had to make a\r\nfool of myself openly, judging of this outburst by the sparks of folly\r\nthat are daily seen to issue from me. Let the same be told of all the\r\nrest, keeping to the order of our games, and let each one try to found\r\nhis opinion upon some actual sign and argument. And thus we shall each\r\nderive from our game the advantage of learning our defects, and so shall\r\nbe better able to guard against them; and if the vein of folly that is\r\ndiscovered proves so rich that it seems incurable, we will assist it,\r\nand according to fra Mariano’s[60] teaching, we shall have saved a soul,\r\nwhich will be no small gain.”\r\n\r\nThere was much laughter at this game, nor were there any who could keep\r\nfrom talking; one said, “I should make a fool of myself over thinking;”\r\nanother, “Over looking;” another said, “I have already made a fool of\r\nmyself over loving;” and the like.\r\n\r\n9.—Then fra Serafino[61] said, laughing after his manner:\r\n\r\n“That would take too long; but if you want a fine game, let everyone\r\ngive his opinion why it is that nearly all women hold rats in hatred,\r\nand are fond of snakes; and you will see that no one will guess the\r\nreason except myself, who learned this secret in a strange way.” And he\r\nbegan to tell his stories; but my lady Emilia bade him be silent, and\r\npassing over the lady who sat next, made sign to the Unico Aretino whose\r\nturn it was; and he, without waiting for further command, said:\r\n\r\n“I would I were a judge with power to search the heart of evil-doers by\r\nevery sort of torture; and this that I might fathom the deceits of an\r\ningrate with angel eyes and serpent heart, who never lets her tongue\r\nreveal her soul, and with deceitful pity feigned has no thought but of\r\ndissecting hearts. Nor is there in sandy Libya to be found a serpent so\r\nvenomous and eager for human blood as is this false one; who not only in\r\nthe sweetness of her voice and honeyed words, but in her eyes, her\r\nsmiles, her aspect and in all her ways, is a very siren.\r\n\r\n“But since I am not suffered, as I would I were, to use chains, rope and\r\nfire to learn a certain truth, I fain would learn it by a game,—which is\r\nthis: let each one tell what he believes to be the meaning of that\r\nletter S which my lady Duchess wears upon her brow;[62] for, although\r\nthis too is surely an artful veil to aid deceit, perchance there will be\r\ngiven it some interpretation unthought of by her perhaps, and it will be\r\nfound that fortune, compassionate spectatress of men’s martyrdoms, has\r\nled her against her will to disclose by this small token her secret wish\r\nto slay and bury alive in calamity everyone who beholds her or serves\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BERNARDO ACCOLTI\r\n  THE UNICO ARETINO\r\n  1465?-1535\r\n]\r\n\r\nHead enlarged from a photograph, specially made by Alinari, of a part of\r\n    the fresco, “Leo X’s Entry into Florence,” in the Palazzo Vecchio at\r\n    Florence, by Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574). See Milanesi’s edition of\r\n    Vasari’s _Opere_, viii, 142.\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess laughed, and the Unico, seeing that she wished to defend\r\nherself against this imputation, said:\r\n\r\n“Nay, my Lady, do not speak, for it is not now your turn to speak.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia then turned and said:\r\n\r\n“Sir Unico, there is no one of us here who does not yield to you in\r\neverything, but above all in knowledge of my lady Duchess’s mind; and\r\nsince you know it better than the others (thanks to your divine genius),\r\nyou love it better than the others, who like those weak-sighted birds\r\nthat fix not their eyes upon the sun’s orb, cannot so justly know how\r\nperfect it is; wherefore every effort to clear this doubt would be vain,\r\nsave your own judgment. To you alone then be left this task, as to him\r\nwho alone can perform it.”\r\n\r\nThe Unico remained silent for a while, then being urged to speak, at\r\nlast recited a sonnet upon the aforesaid subject, declaring what that\r\nletter S meant; which was by many believed to be done impromptu, but as\r\nit was more ingenious and finished than seemed to accord with the\r\nshortness of the time, it was thought rather to have been prepared.[62]\r\n\r\n10.—Then having bestowed a merry plaudit in praise of the sonnet, and\r\ntalked of it awhile, my lord Ottaviano Fregoso, whose turn it was,\r\nsmilingly began as follows:\r\n\r\n“My Lords, if I were to affirm that I had never felt the passion of\r\nlove, I am sure that my lady Duchess and my lady Emilia would feign to\r\nbelieve it even though they believed it not, and would say that it was\r\nbecause I mistrusted ever being able to prevail upon any woman to love\r\nme; whereof indeed I have not made trial hitherto with such persistence\r\nas reasonably to despair of being able sometime to succeed. But yet I\r\nhave not refrained because I rate myself so high, or women so low, that\r\nI do not deem many of them worthy to be loved and served by me; but made\r\ntimourous rather by the continual laments of some lovers, who—pallid,\r\ngloomy and taciturn—seem always to wear their unhappiness depicted in\r\ntheir eyes; and if they speak, they accompany every word with triple\r\nsighs, and discourse of nothing but tears, torments, despairings and\r\nlongings for death; so that if an amourous spark has sometimes kindled\r\nin my heart, I have at once striven with all my might to quench it, not\r\nfrom any hate I bear to women as these ladies think, but for my own\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n“I have also known some others quite different from these dolourous\r\nsouls,—lovers who not only give thanks and praise for the kind looks,\r\ntender words and gentle bearing of their mistresses, but flavour all\r\nevils with sweetness, so that they call their ladies’ warrings, anger\r\nand disdain, most sweet. Wherefore such as these seem to me far more\r\nthan happy. For if they find such sweetness in lovers’ quarrels, which\r\nthose others deem far more bitter than death, I think that in loving\r\nendearments they must enjoy that supreme beatitude which we vainly seek\r\nin this world. So I would that this evening our game might be, that each\r\nman tell, if she whom he loves must needs be angry with him, by what\r\ncause he would have her anger roused. Because if there be any here who\r\nhave enjoyed this sweet anger, I am sure that out of courtesy they will\r\nchoose one of those causes that make it so sweet; and perhaps I shall\r\ntake courage to advance a little farther in love, hoping that I too may\r\nfind this sweetness where some find bitterness; and then these ladies\r\nwill be no longer able to cast shame upon me because I do not love.”\r\n\r\n11.—This game found much favour and everyone made ready to speak upon\r\nthe subject, but as my lady Emilia made no further mention of it, messer\r\nPietro Bembo, who sat next in order, spoke thus:\r\n\r\n“My Lords, no small uncertainty has been awakened in my mind by the game\r\nproposed by my lord Ottaviano in his discourse about love’s anger: the\r\nwhich, however varied it be, has in my case always been most bitter, nor\r\ndo I believe that any seasoning could be learned from me that would\r\navail to sweeten it; but perhaps it is more or less bitter according to\r\nthe cause from which it springs.[63] For I remember once to have seen\r\nthe lady whom I served wrought up against me, either by some idle\r\nsuspicion that she had herself conceived as to my loyalty, or by some\r\nother false notion awakened in her by what others had said to my injury;\r\ninsomuch that I believed no pain could equal mine, and it seemed to me\r\nthat the greatest suffering I felt was to endure that which I had not\r\ndeserved, and to have this affliction come upon me not from my fault but\r\nfrom her lack of love. At other times I saw her angered by some errour\r\nof mine, and knew her ire to proceed from my fault; and then I deemed\r\nthat my former woe was very light compared with that which now I felt;\r\nand it seemed to me that to have displeased, and through my own guilt,\r\nthe person whom alone I desired and so zealously strove to please, was\r\nthe greatest torment and above all others. I would therefore that our\r\ngame might be that each man tell, if she whom he loves must needs be\r\nangry with him, from which of the two he would have her anger spring,\r\nfrom her or from himself; so that we may know which is the greater\r\nsuffering, to give displeasure to her who is loved, or to receive it\r\nfrom her who is loved.”\r\n\r\n12.—Everyone waited for my lady Emilia to reply; but she, saying nothing\r\nmore to Bembo, turned and made sign to messer Federico Fregoso that he\r\nshould tell his game; and he at once began as follows:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, I would it were permitted me, as it sometimes is, to assent to\r\nanother’s proposal; since for my part I would readily approve any of the\r\ngames proposed by these gentlemen, for I really think that all of them\r\nwould be amusing. But not to break our rule, I say that anyone who\r\nwished to praise our court,—laying aside the merit of our lady Duchess,\r\nwhich with her divine virtue would suffice to lift from earth to heaven\r\nthe meanest souls that are in the world,—might well say without\r\nsuspicion of flattery, that in all Italy it would perhaps be hard to\r\nfind so many cavaliers so singularly admirable and so excellent in\r\ndivers other matters besides the chief concerns of chivalry, as are now\r\nto be found here: wherefore if anywhere there be men who deserve to be\r\ncalled good Courtiers and who are able to judge of what pertains to the\r\nperfection of Courtiership, it is reasonable to believe that they are\r\nhere. So, to repress the many fools who by impudence and folly think to\r\nwin the name of good Courtier, I would that this evening’s game might\r\nbe, that we select some one of the company and give him the task of\r\nportraying a perfect Courtier, explaining all the conditions and special\r\nqualities requisite in one who deserves this title; and as to those\r\nthings that shall not appear sound, let everyone be allowed to\r\ncontradict, as in the schools of the philosophers it is allowed to\r\ncontradict anyone who proposes a thesis.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico was continuing his discourse still further, when my lady\r\nEmilia interrupted him and said:\r\n\r\n“This, if it pleases my lady Duchess, shall for the present be our\r\ngame.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess answered:\r\n\r\n“It does please me.”\r\n\r\nThen nearly all those present began to say, both to my lady Duchess and\r\namong themselves, that this was the finest game that could possibly be;\r\nand without waiting for each other’s answer, they entreated my lady\r\nEmilia to decide who should begin. She turned to my lady Duchess and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Command, my Lady, him who it best pleases you should have this task;\r\nfor I do not wish, by selecting one rather than another, to seem to\r\ndecide whom I think more competent in this matter than the rest, and so\r\ndo wrong to anyone.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess replied:\r\n\r\n“Nay, make this choice yourself, and take heed lest by not obeying you\r\ngive an example to the others, so that they too prove disobedient in\r\ntheir turn.”\r\n\r\n13.—At this my lady Emilia laughed and said to Count Ludovico da\r\nCanossa:\r\n\r\n“Then not to lose more time, you, Count, shall be the one to take this\r\nenterprise after the manner that messer Federico has described; not\r\nindeed because we account you so good a Courtier that you know what\r\nbefits one, but because, if you say everything wrong as we hope you\r\nwill, the game will be more lively, for everyone will then have\r\nsomething to answer you; while if someone else had this task who knew\r\nmore than you, it would be impossible to contradict him in anything,\r\nbecause he would tell the truth, and so the game would be tedious.”\r\n\r\nThe Count answered quickly:\r\n\r\n“Whoever told the truth, my Lady, would run no risk of lacking\r\ncontradiction, so long as you were present;” and after some laughter at\r\nthis retort, he continued: “But truly I would fain escape this burden,\r\nit seeming to me too heavy, and I being conscious that what you said in\r\njest is very true; that is, that I do not know what befits a good\r\nCourtier: and I do not seek to prove this with further argument,\r\nbecause, as I do not practise the rules of Courtiership, one may judge\r\nthat I do not know them; and I think my blame may be the less, for sure\r\nit is worse not to wish to do well than not to know how. Yet, since it\r\nso happens that you are pleased to have me bear this burden, I neither\r\ncan nor will refuse it, in order not to contravene our rule and your\r\njudgment, which I rate far higher than my own.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COUNT LUDOVICO DA CANOSSA\r\n  1476-1532\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from a photograph, specially made through the courtesy of the\r\n    Bishop of Bayeux, of an anonymous portrait in his possession. The\r\n    sadly injured condition of the original rendered it necessary to\r\n    retouch the negative, in which process recourse was had to a small\r\n    photograph, kindly furnished by the Marquess Ottavio di Canossa, of\r\n    his copy of the Bayeux portrait.\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“As the early evening is now spent and many other kinds of entertainment\r\nare ready, perhaps it will be well to put off this discussion until\r\nto-morrow and give the Count time to think of what he has to say; for it\r\nis difficult indeed to speak unprepared on such a subject.”\r\n\r\nThe Count replied:\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to be like the fellow who, when stripped to his shirt,\r\nvaulted less well than he had done in his doublet; hence it seems to me\r\ngood fortune that the hour is late, for I shall be obliged by the\r\nshortness of the time to say but little, and my not having taken thought\r\nwill excuse me, so that I shall be allowed to say without blame whatever\r\nfirst comes to my lips.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, not to carry this burden of duty longer on my shoulders, I\r\nsay that in everything it is so hard to know the true perfection as to\r\nbe well nigh impossible; and this because of the variety of opinions.\r\nThus there are many that will like a man who speaks much, and will call\r\nhim pleasing; some will prefer modesty; some others, an active and\r\nrestless man; still others, one who shows calmness and deliberation in\r\neverything; and so every man praises or decries according to his mind,\r\nalways clothing vice with the name of its kindred virtue, or virtue with\r\nthe name of its kindred vice; for example, calling an impudent man\r\nfrank, a modest man dull, an ignorant man good, a knave discreet; and so\r\nin all things else. Yet I believe that there exists in everything its\r\nown perfection, although concealed; and that this can be determined\r\nthrough rational discussion by any having knowledge of the thing in\r\nhand. And since, as I have said, the truth often lies concealed, and I\r\ndo not profess to have this knowledge, I can only praise the kind of\r\nCourtier that I most esteem, and approve him who seems to me nearest\r\nright, according to my poor judgment; the which you will follow if you\r\nfind it good, or you will hold to your own if it differs from mine. Nor\r\nshall I at all insist that mine is better than yours; not only because\r\nyou may think one thing and I another, but I myself may sometimes think\r\none thing, and sometimes another.\r\n\r\n14.—“I wish, then, that this Courtier of ours should be nobly born and\r\nof gentle race; because it is far less unseemly for one of ignoble birth\r\nto fail in worthy deeds, than for one of noble birth, who, if he strays\r\nfrom the path of his predecessors, stains his family name, and not only\r\nfails to achieve but loses what has been achieved already; for noble\r\nbirth is like a bright lamp that manifests and makes visible good and\r\nevil deeds, and kindles and stimulates to virtue both by fear of shame\r\nand by hope of praise. And since this splendour of nobility does not\r\nillumine the deeds of the humbly born, they lack that stimulus and fear\r\nof shame, nor do they feel any obligation to advance beyond what their\r\npredecessors have done; while to the nobly born it seems a reproach not\r\nto reach at least the goal set them by their ancestors. And thus it\r\nnearly always happens that both in the profession of arms and in other\r\nworthy pursuits the most famous men have been of noble birth, because\r\nnature has implanted in everything that hidden seed which gives a\r\ncertain force and quality of its own essence to all things that are\r\nderived from it, and makes them like itself: as we see not only in the\r\nbreeds of horses and of other animals, but also in trees, the shoots of\r\nwhich nearly always resemble the trunk; and if they sometimes\r\ndegenerate, it arises from poor cultivation. And so it is with men, who\r\nif rightly trained are nearly always like those from whom they spring,\r\nand often better; but if there be no one to give them proper care, they\r\nbecome like savages and never reach perfection.\r\n\r\n“It is true that, by favour of the stars or of nature, some men are\r\nendowed at birth with such graces that they seem not to have been born,\r\nbut rather as if some god had formed them with his very hands and\r\nadorned them with every excellence of mind and body. So too there are\r\nmany men so foolish and rude that one cannot but think that nature\r\nbrought them into the world out of contempt or mockery. Just as these\r\ncan usually accomplish little even with constant diligence and good\r\ntraining, so with slight pains those others reach the highest summit of\r\nexcellence. And to give you an instance: you see my lord Don Ippolito\r\nd’Este,[64] Cardinal of Ferrara, who has enjoyed such fortune from his\r\nbirth, that his person, his aspect, his words and all his movements are\r\nso disposed and imbued with this grace, that—although he is young—he\r\nexhibits among the most aged prelates such weight of character that he\r\nseems fitter to teach than to be taught; likewise in conversation with\r\nmen and women of every rank, in games, in pleasantry and in banter, he\r\nhas a certain sweetness and manners so gracious, that whoso speaks with\r\nhim or even sees him, must needs remain attached to him forever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  IPPOLITO D’ESTE\r\n  1479-1520\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a cast, courteously furnished by the Austrian authorities,\r\n    of an anonymous medal in the Imperial Museum at Vienna. See Armand’s\r\n    _Les Médailleurs Italiens_, iii, 169, G.\r\n\r\n“But to return to our subject: I say that there is a middle state\r\nbetween perfect grace on the one hand and senseless folly on the other;\r\nand those who are not thus perfectly endowed by nature, with study and\r\ntoil can in great part polish and amend their natural defects. Besides\r\nhis noble birth, then, I would have the Courtier favoured in this regard\r\nalso, and endowed by nature not only with talent and beauty of person\r\nand feature, but with a certain grace and (as we say) air that shall\r\nmake him at first sight pleasing and agreeable to all who see him; and I\r\nwould have this an ornament that should dispose and unite all his\r\nactions, and in his outward aspect give promise of whatever is worthy\r\nthe society and favour of every great lord.”\r\n\r\n15.—Here, without waiting longer, my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“In order that our game may have the form prescribed, and that we may\r\nnot seem to slight the privilege given us to contradict, I say that this\r\nnobility of birth does not appear to me so essential in the Courtier;\r\nand if I thought I were saying what was new to any of us, I should cite\r\ninstances of many men born of the noblest blood who have been full of\r\nvices; and on the other hand, of many men among the humbly born who by\r\ntheir virtue have made their posterity illustrious. And if what you just\r\nsaid be true, namely that there is in everything this occult influence\r\nof the original seed, then we should all be in the same case, because we\r\nhad the same origin, nor would any man be more noble than another. But\r\nas to our differences and grades of eminence and obscurity, I believe\r\nthere are many other causes: among which I rate fortune to be chief; for\r\nwe see her holding sway in all mundane affairs, often amusing herself by\r\nlifting to heaven whom she pleases (although wholly without merit), and\r\nburying in the depths those most worthy to be exalted.\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with what you say as to the good fortune of those endowed\r\nfrom birth with advantages of mind and body: but this is seen as well\r\namong the humbly born as among the nobly born, since nature has no such\r\nsubtle distinctions as these; and often, as I said, the highest gifts of\r\nnature are found among the most obscure. Therefore, since this nobility\r\nof birth is won neither by talent nor by strength nor by craft, and is\r\nrather the merit of our predecessors than our own, it seems to me too\r\nextravagant to maintain that if our Courtier’s parents be humbly born,\r\nall his good qualities are spoiled, and that all those other\r\nqualifications that you mentioned do not avail to raise him to the\r\nsummit of perfection; I mean talent, beauty of feature, comeliness of\r\nperson, and that grace which makes him always charming to everyone at\r\nfirst sight.”\r\n\r\n16.—Then Count Ludovico replied:\r\n\r\n“I do not deny that the same virtues may rule the low-born and the\r\nnoble: but (not to repeat what we have said already or the many other\r\narguments that could be adduced in praise of noble birth, which is\r\nhonoured always and by everyone, it being reasonable that good should\r\nbeget good), since we have to form a Courtier without flaw and endowed\r\nwith every praiseworthy quality, it seems to me necessary to make him\r\nnobly born, as well for many other reasons as for universal opinion,\r\nwhich is at once disposed in favour of noble birth. For if there be two\r\nCourtiers who have as yet given no impression of themselves by good or\r\nevil acts, as soon as the one is known to have been born a gentleman and\r\nthe other not, he who is low-born will be far less esteemed by everyone\r\nthan he who is high-born, and will need much effort and time to make\r\nupon men’s minds that good impression which the other will have achieved\r\nin a moment and merely by being a gentleman. And how important these\r\nimpressions are, everyone can easily understand: for in our own case we\r\nhave seen men present themselves in this house, who, being silly and\r\nawkward in the extreme, yet had throughout Italy the reputation of very\r\ngreat Courtiers; and although they were detected and recognized at last,\r\nstill they imposed upon us for many days, and maintained in our minds\r\nthat opinion of them which they first found impressed there, although\r\nthey conducted themselves after the slightness of their worth. We have\r\nseen others, held at first in small esteem, then admirably successful at\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n“And of these mistakes there are various causes: and among others, the\r\nregard of princes, who in their wish to perform miracles sometimes\r\nundertake to bestow favour on a man who seems to them to merit\r\ndisfavour. And often too they are themselves deceived; but since they\r\nalways have a host of imitators, their favour begets very great fame,\r\nwhich chiefly guides our judgments: and if we find anything that seems\r\ncontrary to common opinion, we suspect that it is we ourselves who are\r\nwrong, and always seek for something hidden: because it seems that these\r\nuniversal opinions must after all be founded on fact and spring from\r\nrational causes; and because our minds are very prone to love and hate,\r\nas is seen in battle-shows and games and every other sort of contest,\r\nwherein the spectators without apparent cause become partisans of one\r\nside, with eager wish that it may win and the other lose. In our opinion\r\nof men’s character also, good or evil fame sways our minds to one of\r\nthese two passions from the start; and thus it happens that we usually\r\njudge with love or hate. You see then how important this first\r\nimpression is, and how he ought to strive to make a good one at the\r\noutset, who thinks to hold the rank and name of good Courtier.\r\n\r\n17.—“But to come to some details, I am of opinion that the principal and\r\ntrue profession of the Courtier ought to be that of arms; which I would\r\nhave him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as\r\nbold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. And he will win a\r\nreputation for these good qualities by exercising them at all times and\r\nin all places, since one may never fail in this without severest\r\ncensure. And just as among women, their fair fame once sullied never\r\nrecovers its first lustre, so the reputation of a gentleman who bears\r\narms, if once it be in the least tarnished with cowardice or other\r\ndisgrace, remains forever infamous before the world and full of\r\nignominy. Therefore the more our Courtier excels in this art, the more\r\nhe will be worthy of praise; and yet I do not deem essential in him that\r\nperfect knowledge of things and those other qualities that befit a\r\ncommander; since this would be too wide a sea, let us be content, as we\r\nhave said, with perfect loyalty and unconquered courage, and that he be\r\nalways seen to possess them. For the courageous are often recognized\r\neven more in small things than in great; and frequently in perils of\r\nimportance and where there are many spectators, some men are to be\r\nfound, who, although their hearts be dead within them, yet, moved by\r\nshame or by the presence of others, press forward almost with their eyes\r\nshut, and do their duty God knows how. While on occasions of little\r\nmoment, when they think they can avoid putting themselves in danger\r\nwithout being detected, they are glad to keep safe. But those who, even\r\nwhen they do not expect to be observed or seen or recognized by anyone,\r\nshow their ardour and neglect nothing, however paltry, that may be laid\r\nto their charge,—they have that strength of mind which we seek in our\r\nCourtier.\r\n\r\n“Not that we would have him look so fierce, or go about blustering, or\r\nsay that he has taken his cuirass to wife, or threaten with those grim\r\nscowls that we have often seen in Berto;[65] because to such men as\r\nthis, one might justly say that which a brave lady jestingly said in\r\ngentle company to one whom I will not name at present;[66] who, being\r\ninvited by her out of compliment to dance, refused not only that, but to\r\nlisten to the music, and many other entertainments proposed to\r\nhim,—saying always that such silly trifles were not his business; so\r\nthat at last the lady said, ‘What is your business, then?’ He replied\r\nwith a sour look, ‘To fight.’ Then the lady at once said, ‘Now that you\r\nare in no war and out of fighting trim, I should think it were a good\r\nthing to have yourself well oiled, and to stow yourself with all your\r\nbattle harness in a closet until you be needed, lest you grow more rusty\r\nthan you are;’ and so, amid much laughter from the bystanders, she left\r\nthe discomfited fellow to his silly presumption.\r\n\r\n“Therefore let the man we are seeking, be very bold, stern, and always\r\namong the first, where the enemy are to be seen; and in every other\r\nplace, gentle, modest, reserved, above all things avoiding ostentation\r\nand that impudent self-praise by which men ever excite hatred and\r\ndisgust in all who hear them.”\r\n\r\n18.—Then my lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“As for me, I have known few men excellent in anything whatever, who do\r\nnot praise themselves; and it seems to me that this may well be\r\npermitted them; for when anyone who feels himself to be of worth, sees\r\nthat he is not known to the ignorant by his works, he is offended that\r\nhis worth should lie buried, and needs must in some way hold it up to\r\nview, in order that he may not be cheated of the fame that is the true\r\nreward of worthy effort. Thus among the ancient authors, whoever carries\r\nweight seldom fails to praise himself. They indeed are insufferable who\r\ndo this without desert, but such we do not presume our Courtier to be.”\r\n\r\nThe Count then said:\r\n\r\n“If you heard what I said, it was impudent and indiscriminate\r\nself-praise that I censured: and as you say, we surely ought not to form\r\na bad opinion of a brave man who praises himself modestly, nay we ought\r\nrather to regard such praise as better evidence than if it came from the\r\nmouth of others. I say, however, that he, who in praising himself runs\r\ninto no errour and incurs no annoyance or envy at the hands of those\r\nthat hear him, is a very discreet man indeed and merits praise from\r\nothers in addition to that which he bestows upon himself; because it is\r\na very difficult matter.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“You must teach us that.”\r\n\r\nThe Count replied:\r\n\r\n“Among the ancient authors there is no lack of those who have taught it;\r\nbut to my thinking, the whole art consists in saying things in such a\r\nway that they shall not seem to be said to that end, but let fall so\r\nnaturally that it was impossible not to say them, and while seeming\r\nalways to avoid self-praise, yet to achieve it; but not after the manner\r\nof those boasters, who open their mouths and let the words come forth\r\nhaphazard. Like one of our friends a few days ago, who, being quite run\r\nthrough the thigh with a spear at Pisa, said he thought it was a fly\r\nthat had stung him; and another man said he kept no mirrour in his room\r\nbecause, when angry, he became so terrible to look at, that the sight of\r\nhimself would have frightened him too much.”\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed at this, but messer Cesare Gonzaga added:\r\n\r\n“Why do you laugh? Do you not know that Alexander the Great, on hearing\r\nthe opinion of a philosopher[67] to be that there was an infinite number\r\nof worlds, began to weep, and being asked why he wept, replied, ‘Because\r\nI have not yet conquered one of them;’ as if he would fain have\r\nvanquished all? Does not this seem to you a greater boast than that\r\nabout the fly-sting?”\r\n\r\nThen the Count said:\r\n\r\n“Yes, and Alexander was a greater man than he who made the other speech.\r\nBut extraordinary men are surely to be pardoned when they assume much;\r\nfor he who has great things to do must needs have daring to do them, and\r\nconfidence in himself, and must not be abject or mean in spirit, yet\r\nvery modest in speech, showing less confidence in himself than he has,\r\nlest his self-confidence lead to rashness.”\r\n\r\n19.—The Count now paused a little, and messer Bernardo Bibbiena said,\r\nlaughing:\r\n\r\n“I remember what you said earlier, that this Courtier of ours must be\r\nendowed by nature with beauty of countenance and person, and with a\r\ngrace that shall make him so agreeable. Grace and beauty of countenance\r\nI think I certainly possess, and this is the reason why so many ladies\r\nare ardently in love with me, as you know; but I am rather doubtful as\r\nto the beauty of my person, especially as regards these legs of mine,\r\nwhich seem to me decidedly less well proportioned than I should wish: as\r\nto my bust and other members however, I am quite content. Pray, now,\r\ndescribe a little more in particular the sort of body that the Courtier\r\nis to have, so that I may dismiss this doubt and set my mind at rest.”\r\n\r\nAfter some laughter at this, the Count continued:\r\n\r\n“Of a certainty that grace of countenance can be truly said to be yours,\r\nnor need I cite further example than this to show what manner of thing\r\nit is, for we unquestionably perceive your aspect to be most agreeable\r\nand pleasing to everyone, albeit the lineaments of it are not very\r\ndelicate. Still it is of a manly cast and at the same time full of\r\ngrace; and this characteristic is to be found in many different types of\r\ncountenance. And of such sort I would have our Courtier’s aspect; not so\r\nsoft and effeminate as is sought by many, who not only curl their hair\r\nand pluck their brows, but gloss their faces with all those arts\r\nemployed by the most wanton and unchaste women in the world; and in\r\ntheir walk, posture and every act, they seem so limp and languid that\r\ntheir limbs are like to fall apart; and they pronounce their words so\r\nmournfully that they appear about to expire upon the spot: and the more\r\nthey find themselves with men of rank, the more they affect such tricks.\r\nSince nature has not made them women, as they seem to wish to appear and\r\nbe, they should be treated not as good women but as public harlots, and\r\ndriven not merely from the courts of great lords but from the society of\r\nhonest men.\r\n\r\n20.—“Then coming to the bodily frame, I say it is enough if this be\r\nneither extremely short nor tall, for both of these conditions excite a\r\ncertain contemptuous surprise, and men of either sort are gazed upon in\r\nmuch the same way that we gaze on monsters. Yet if we must offend in one\r\nof the two extremes, it is preferable to fall a little short of the just\r\nmeasure of height than to exceed it, for besides often being dull of\r\nintellect, men thus huge of body are also unfit for every exercise of\r\nagility, which thing I should much wish in the Courtier. And so I would\r\nhave him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show\r\nstrength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises\r\nthat befit a man of war: whereof I think the first should be to handle\r\nevery sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the\r\nadvantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those weapons\r\nthat are ordinarily used among gentlemen; for besides the use of them in\r\nwar, where such subtlety in contrivance is perhaps not needful, there\r\nfrequently arise differences between one gentleman and another, which\r\nafterwards result in duels often fought with such weapons as happen at\r\nthe moment to be within reach: thus knowledge of this kind is a very\r\nsafe thing. Nor am I one of those who say that skill is forgotten in the\r\nhour of need; for he whose skill forsakes him at such a time, indeed\r\ngives token that he has already lost heart and head through fear.\r\n\r\n21.—“Moreover I deem it very important to know how to wrestle, for it is\r\na great help in the use of all kinds of weapons on foot. Then, both for\r\nhis own sake and for that of his friends, he must understand the\r\nquarrels and differences that may arise, and must be quick to seize an\r\nadvantage, always showing courage and prudence in all things.[68] Nor\r\nshould he be too ready to fight except when honour demands it; for\r\nbesides the great danger that the uncertainty of fate entails, he who\r\nrushes into such affairs recklessly and without urgent cause, merits the\r\nseverest censure even though he be successful. But when he finds himself\r\nso far engaged that he cannot withdraw without reproach, he ought to be\r\nmost deliberate, both in the preliminaries to the duel and in the duel\r\nitself, and always show readiness and daring. Nor must he act like some,\r\nwho fritter the affair away in disputes and controversies, and who,\r\nhaving the choice of weapons, select those that neither cut nor pierce,\r\nand arm themselves as if they were expecting a cannonade; and thinking\r\nit enough not to be defeated, stand ever on the defensive and\r\nretreat,—showing therein their utter cowardice. And thus they make\r\nthemselves a laughing-stock for boys, like those two men of Ancona who\r\nfought at Perugia not long since, and made everyone laugh who saw them.”\r\n\r\n“And who were they?” asked my lord Gaspar Pallavicino.\r\n\r\n“Two cousins,” replied messer Cesare.\r\n\r\nThen the Count said:\r\n\r\n“In their fighting they were as like as two brothers;” and soon\r\ncontinued: “Even in time of peace weapons are often used in various\r\nexercises, and gentlemen appear in public shows before the people and\r\nladies and great lords. For this reason I would have our Courtier a\r\nperfect horseman in every kind of seat; and besides understanding horses\r\nand what pertains to riding, I would have him use all possible care and\r\ndiligence to lift himself a little beyond the rest in everything, so\r\nthat he may be ever recognized as eminent above all others. And as we\r\nread of Alcibiades that he surpassed all the nations with whom he lived,\r\neach in their particular province, so I would have this Courtier of ours\r\nexcel all others, and each in that which is most their profession. And\r\nas it is the especial pride of the Italians to ride well with the rein,\r\nto govern wild horses with consummate skill, and to play at tilting and\r\njousting,—in these things let him be among the best of the Italians. In\r\ntourneys and in the arts of defence and attack, let him shine among the\r\nbest in France.[69] In stick-throwing, bull-fighting, and in casting\r\nspears and darts, let him excel among the Spaniards. But above\r\neverything he should temper all his movements with a certain good\r\njudgment and grace, if he wishes to merit that universal favour which is\r\nso greatly prized.\r\n\r\n22.—“There are also many other exercises, which although not immediately\r\ndependent upon arms, yet are closely connected therewith, and greatly\r\nfoster manly sturdiness; and one of the chief among these seems to me to\r\nbe the chase, because it bears a certain likeness to war: and truly it\r\nis an amusement for great lords and befitting a man at court, and\r\nfurthermore it is seen to have been much cultivated among the ancients.\r\nIt is fitting also to know how to swim, to leap, to run, to throw\r\nstones, for besides the use that may be made of this in war, a man often\r\nhas occasion to show what he can do in such matters; whence good esteem\r\nis to be won, especially with the multitude, who must be taken into\r\naccount withal. Another admirable exercise, and one very befitting a man\r\nat court, is the game of tennis, in which are well shown the disposition\r\nof the body, the quickness and suppleness of every member, and all those\r\nqualities that are seen in nearly every other exercise. Nor less highly\r\ndo I esteem vaulting on horse, which although it be fatiguing and\r\ndifficult, makes a man very light and dexterous more than any other\r\nthing; and besides its utility, if this lightness is accompanied by\r\ngrace, it is to my thinking a finer show than any of the others.[70]\r\n\r\n“Our Courtier having once become more than fairly expert in these\r\nexercises, I think he should leave the others on one side: such as\r\nturning summersaults, rope-walking, and the like, which savour of the\r\nmountebank and little befit a gentleman.\r\n\r\n“But since one cannot devote himself to such fatiguing exercises\r\ncontinually, and since repetition becomes very tiresome and abates the\r\nadmiration felt for what is rare, we must always diversify our life with\r\nvarious occupations. For this reason I would have our Courtier sometimes\r\ndescend to quieter and more tranquil exercises, and in order to escape\r\nenvy and to entertain himself agreeably with everyone, let him do\r\nwhatever others do, yet never departing from praiseworthy deeds, and\r\ngoverning himself with that good judgment which will keep him from all\r\nfolly; but let him laugh, jest, banter, frolic and dance, yet in such\r\nfashion that he shall always appear genial and discreet, and that\r\neverything he may do or say shall be stamped with grace.”\r\n\r\n23.—Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“We certainly ought on no account to hinder the course of this\r\ndiscussion; but if I were to keep silence, I should be neglectful both\r\nof the right I have to speak and of my desire to know one thing: and let\r\nme be pardoned if I ask a question instead of contradicting; for this I\r\nthink may be permitted me, after the precedent of messer Bernardo here,\r\nwho in his over desire to be held comely, broke the rules of our game by\r\nasking a question instead of contradicting.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“You see how one errour begets many. Therefore he who transgresses and\r\nsets a bad example, like messer Bernardo, deserves to be punished not\r\nonly for his own transgression but also for the others’.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare replied:\r\n\r\n“In that case, my Lady, I shall be exempt from penalty, since messer\r\nBernardo is to be punished for his own fault as well as mine.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said my lady Duchess, “you both ought to have double punishment:\r\nhe for his own transgression and for leading you to transgress; you for\r\nyour own transgression and for imitating him.”\r\n\r\n“My Lady,” replied messer Cesare, “as yet I have not transgressed; so,\r\nto leave all this punishment to messer Bernardo alone, I will keep\r\nsilence.”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed he remained silent; when my lady Emilia laughed and said:\r\n\r\n“Say whatever you like, for under leave of my lady Duchess I pardon him\r\nthat has transgressed and him that shall transgress, in so small a\r\ndegree.”\r\n\r\n“I consent,” continued my lady Duchess. “But take care lest perchance\r\nyou fall into the mistake of thinking to gain more by being merciful\r\nthan by being just; for to pardon him too easily that has transgressed\r\nis to wrong him that transgresses not. Yet I would not have my severity\r\nreproach your indulgence, and thus be the cause of our not hearing this\r\nquestion of messer Cesare.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, being given the signal by my lady Duchess and by my lady Emilia,\r\nhe at once said:\r\n\r\n24.—“If I remember rightly, Sir Count, I think you have repeated several\r\ntimes this evening that the Courtier must accompany his actions,\r\ngestures, habits, in short his every movement, with grace; and this you\r\nseem to regard as an universal seasoning, without which all other\r\nproperties and good qualities are of little worth. And indeed I think\r\nthat in this everyone would allow himself to be persuaded easily, since\r\nfrom the very force of the word, it may be said that he who has grace\r\nfinds grace.[71] But since you said that this is oftentimes the gift of\r\nnature and of heaven and, even when not thus perfect, can with care and\r\npains be made much greater,—those men who are born so fortunate and so\r\nrich in this treasure as are some we see, seem to me in this to have\r\nlittle need of other master; because that benign favour of heaven almost\r\nin despite of themselves leads them higher than they will, and makes\r\nthem not only pleasing but admirable to all the world. Therefore I do\r\nnot discuss this, it not being in our power to acquire it of ourselves.\r\nBut they who have received from nature only so much, that they are\r\ncapable of becoming graceful by pains, industry and care,—I long to know\r\nby what art, by what training, by what method, they can acquire this\r\ngrace, as well in bodily exercises (in which you esteem it to be so\r\nnecessary) as also in everything else that they may do or say.\r\nTherefore, since by much praise of this quality you have aroused in all\r\nof us, I think, an ardent thirst to pursue it, you are further bound, by\r\nthe charge that my lady Emilia laid upon you, to satisfy that thirst by\r\nteaching us how to attain it.”\r\n\r\n25.—“I am not bound,” said the Count, “to teach you how to become\r\ngraceful, or anything else; but only to show you what manner of man a\r\nperfect Courtier ought to be. Nor would I in any case undertake the task\r\nof teaching you this perfection; especially having said a little while\r\nago that the Courtier must know how to wrestle, vault, and do many other\r\nthings, which I am sure you all know quite as well as if I, who have\r\nnever learned them, were to teach you. For just as a good soldier knows\r\nhow to tell the smith what fashion, shape and quality his armour ought\r\nto have, but cannot show how it is to be made or forged or tempered; so\r\nI perhaps may be able to tell you what manner of man a perfect Courtier\r\nought to be, but cannot teach you what you must do to become one.\r\n\r\n“Yet to comply with your request as far as is within my power,—although\r\nit is almost a proverb that grace is not to be learned,—I say that\r\nwhoever would acquire grace in bodily exercises (assuming first that he\r\nbe by nature not incapable), ought to begin early and learn the\r\nrudiments from the best masters. And how important this seemed to King\r\nPhilip of Macedon, may be seen from the fact that he chose Aristotle,\r\nthe famous philosopher and perhaps the greatest that has ever been in\r\nthe world, to teach his son Alexander the first elements of letters. And\r\nof the men whom we know at the present day, consider how well and how\r\ngracefully my lord Galeazzo Sanseverino,[72] Grand Equerry of France,\r\nperforms all bodily exercises; and this because in addition to the\r\nnatural aptitude of person that he possesses, he has taken the utmost\r\npains to study with good masters, and always to have about him men who\r\nexcel and to select from each the best of what they know: for just as in\r\nwrestling, vaulting and in the use of many sorts of weapons, he has\r\ntaken for his guide our friend messer Pietro Monte, who (as you know) is\r\nthe true and only master of every form of trained strength and\r\nagility,—so in riding, jousting and all else, he has ever had before his\r\neyes the most proficient men that were known in those matters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GALEAZZO SANSEVERINO\r\n  Married 1489\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Anderson’s photograph (no. 11129) of an anonymous and\r\n    unfinished portrait in the Ambrosiana Gallery at Milan. By some\r\n    critics attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, and by others to his pupil\r\n    Ambrogio da Predis, the picture was by Morelli regarded as having\r\n    nothing to do with either painter. It was formerly supposed to be a\r\n    portrait of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan; for iconographical\r\n    identification, see Paul Müller-Walde’s article in the _Jahrbuch der\r\n    Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen_ for 1897, p. 110.\r\n\r\n26.—“Therefore he who wishes to be a good pupil, besides performing his\r\ntasks well, must put forth every effort to resemble his master, and, if\r\nit were possible, to transform himself into his master. And when he\r\nfeels that he has made some progress, it will be very profitable to\r\nobserve different men of the same calling, and governing himself with\r\nthat good judgment which must ever be his guide, to go about selecting\r\nnow this thing from one and that thing from another. And as the bee in\r\nthe green meadows is ever wont to rob the flowers among the grass, so\r\nour Courtier must steal this grace from all who seem to possess it,\r\ntaking from each that part which shall most be worthy praise; and not\r\nact like a friend of ours whom you all know, who thought he greatly\r\nresembled King Ferdinand the Younger[32] of Aragon, and made it his care\r\nto imitate the latter in nothing but a certain trick of continually\r\nraising the head and twisting one side of the mouth, which the king had\r\ncontracted from some infirmity. And there are many such, who think they\r\ngain a point if only they be like a great man in some thing; and\r\nfrequently they devote themselves to that which is his only fault.\r\n\r\n“But having before now often considered whence this grace springs,\r\nlaying aside those men who have it by nature, I find one universal rule\r\nconcerning it, which seems to me worth more in this matter than any\r\nother in all things human that are done or said: and that is to avoid\r\naffectation to the uttermost and as it were a very sharp and dangerous\r\nrock; and, to use possibly a new word, to practise in everything a\r\ncertain nonchalance[73] that shall conceal design and show that what is\r\ndone and said is done without effort and almost without thought. From\r\nthis I believe grace is in large measure derived, because everyone knows\r\nthe difficulty of those things that are rare and well done, and\r\ntherefore facility in them excites the highest admiration; while on the\r\nother hand, to strive and as the saying is to drag by the hair, is\r\nextremely ungraceful, and makes us esteem everything slightly, however\r\ngreat it be.\r\n\r\n“Accordingly we may affirm that to be true art which does not appear to\r\nbe art; nor to anything must we give greater care than to conceal art,\r\nfor if it is discovered, it quite destroys our credit and brings us into\r\nsmall esteem. And I remember having once read that there were several\r\nvery excellent orators of antiquity, who among their other devices\r\nstrove to make everyone believe that they had no knowledge of letters;\r\nand hiding their knowledge they pretended that their orations were\r\ncomposed very simply and as if springing rather from nature and truth\r\nthan from study and art; the which, if it had been detected, would have\r\nmade men wary of being duped by it.\r\n\r\n“Thus you see how the exhibition of art and study so intense destroys\r\nthe grace in everything. Which of you is there who does not laugh when\r\nour friend messer Pierpaolo dances in his peculiar way, with those\r\ncapers of his,—legs stiff to the toe and head motionless, as if he were\r\na stick, and with such intentness that he actually seems to be counting\r\nthe steps? What eye so blind as not to see in this the ungracefulness of\r\naffectation,—and in many men and women who are here present, the grace\r\nof that nonchalant ease (for in the case of bodily movements many call\r\nit thus), showing by word or laugh or gesture that they have no care and\r\nare thinking more of everything else than of that, to make the onlooker\r\nthink they can hardly go amiss?”\r\n\r\n27.—Messer Bernardo Bibbiena here said, without waiting:\r\n\r\n“Now at last our friend messer Roberto[48] has found someone to praise\r\nthe manner of his dancing, as all the rest of you seem to value it\r\nlightly; because if this merit consists in nonchalance, and in appearing\r\nto take no heed and to be thinking more of everything else than of what\r\nyou are doing, messer Roberto in dancing has no peer on earth; for to\r\nshow plainly that he is not thinking about it, he often lets the cloak\r\ndrop from his shoulders and the slippers from his feet, and still goes\r\non dancing without picking up either the one or the other.”\r\n\r\nThen the Count replied:\r\n\r\n“Since you insist on my talking, I will speak further of our faults. Do\r\nyou not perceive that what you call nonchalance in messer Roberto, is\r\nreally affectation? For it is clearly seen that he is striving with all\r\nhis might to seem to be taking no thought, and this is taking too much\r\nthought; and since it passes the true limits of moderation, his\r\nnonchalance is affected and unbecoming; and it is a thing that works\r\nprecisely the reverse of the effect intended, that is the concealment of\r\nart. Thus in nonchalance (which is praiseworthy in itself), I do not\r\nthink that it is less a vice of affectation to let the clothes fall from\r\none’s back, than in care of dress (which also is praiseworthy in itself)\r\nto hold the head stiff for fear of disarranging one’s locks, or to carry\r\na mirrour in the peak of one’s cap and a comb in one’s sleeve, and to\r\nhave a valet follow one about the streets with sponge and brush: for\r\nsuch care in dress and such nonchalance both touch upon excess, which is\r\nalways offensive and contrary to that pure and charming simplicity which\r\nis so pleasing to the human mind.\r\n\r\n“You see how ungraceful a rider is who strives to sit bolt upright in\r\nthe saddle after the manner we are wont to call Venetian,[74]—as\r\ncompared with another who seems not to be thinking about it, and sits\r\nhis horse as free and steady as if he were afoot. How much more pleasing\r\nand how much more praised is a gentleman who carries arms, if he be\r\nmodest, speak little and boast little, than another who is forever\r\nsounding his own praises, and with blasphemy and bluster seems to be\r\nhurling defiance at the world! This too is naught but affectation of\r\nwishing to appear bold. And so it is with every exercise, nay with\r\neverything that can be done or said in the world.”\r\n\r\n28.—Then my lord Magnifico[9] said:\r\n\r\n“This is true also with music, wherein it is a very great fault to place\r\ntwo perfect consonances one after the other, so that our very sense of\r\nhearing abhors it and often enjoys a second or seventh, which in itself\r\nis a harsh and intolerable discord. And the reason is that repetition of\r\nperfect consonances begets satiety and exhibits a too affected harmony;\r\nwhich is avoided by introducing imperfect consonances, and thus a kind\r\nof contrast is given, whereby our ears are held more in suspense, and\r\nmore eagerly await and enjoy the perfect consonances, and sometimes\r\ndelight in that discord of the second or seventh, as in something\r\nunpremeditated.”\r\n\r\n“You see then,” replied the Count, “the harmful effect of affectation in\r\nthis as in other things. It is said also to have been proverbial among\r\nsome very excellent painters of antiquity, that over diligence is\r\nharmful, and Protogenes is said to have been censured by Apelles because\r\nhe did not know when to take his hand from the tablet.”[75]\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks our friend fra Serafino has this same fault, of not knowing\r\nwhen to take his hands from the table, at least until all the food has\r\nbeen taken from it too.”[76]\r\n\r\nThe Count laughed, and continued:\r\n\r\n“Apelles meant that in his painting Protogenes did not know when he had\r\nfinished, which was the same thing as reproving him for being affected\r\nin his work. Thus this excellence, which is the opposite of affectation\r\nand which for the present we call nonchalance, besides being the true\r\nfountain from which grace springs, carries with it another ornament,\r\nwhich, in accompanying any human action whatever and however trifling it\r\nbe, not only at once reveals the knowledge of him who performs it, but\r\noften leads us to rate his knowledge as much greater than in fact it is;\r\nbecause it impresses upon the minds of the bystanders the idea that he\r\nwho does well so easily, knows much more than he does, and that if he\r\nwere to use care and effort in what he did, he could do it far better.\r\n\r\n“And to multiply like examples, here is a man who handles weapons,\r\neither about to throw a dart or holding a sword in his hand or other\r\nweapon; if he nimbly and without thinking puts himself in an attitude of\r\nreadiness, with such ease that his body and all his members seem to fall\r\ninto that posture naturally and quite without effort,—although he do no\r\nmore, he will prove himself to everyone to be perfect in that exercise.\r\nLikewise in dancing, a single step, a single movement of the person that\r\nis graceful and not forced, soon shows the knowledge of the dancer. A\r\nmusician who in singing utters a single note ending with sweet tone in a\r\nlittle group of four notes with such ease as to seem spontaneous, shows\r\nby that single touch that he can do much more than he is doing. Often\r\ntoo in painting, a single line not laboured, a single brush-stroke\r\neasily drawn, so that it seems as if the hand moves unbidden to its aim\r\naccording to the painter’s wish, without being guided by care or any\r\nskill, clearly reveals the excellence of the craftsman, which every man\r\nappreciates according to his capacity for judging. And the same is true\r\nof nearly everything else.\r\n\r\n“Our Courtier then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in\r\neverything, particularly in speaking, if he avoids affectation; into\r\nwhich fault many fall, and often more than others, some of us Lombards;\r\nwho, if they have been a year away from home, on their return at once\r\nbegin to speak Roman, sometimes Spanish or French, and God knows how.\r\nAnd all this comes from over zeal to appear widely informed; in such\r\nfashion do men devote care and assiduity to acquiring a very odious\r\nfault. And truly it would be no light task for me, if I were to try in\r\nthese discussions of ours to use those antique Tuscan words that are\r\nquite rejected by the usage of the Tuscans of to-day; and besides I\r\nthink everyone would laugh at me.”\r\n\r\n29.—Then messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“Of course in discussing among ourselves as we now are doing, perhaps it\r\nwould be amiss to use those antique Tuscan words, since (as you say)\r\nthey would be fatiguing to him who uttered them and to him who listened\r\nto them, and by many would not be understood without difficulty. But if\r\none were writing, I should certainly think he would be wrong not to use\r\nthem, because they add much grace and authority to writing, and from\r\nthem there results a style more grave and full of majesty than from\r\nmodern words.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” replied the Count, “that writings can gain grace and\r\nauthority from those words that ought to be avoided, not merely in such\r\ntalk as we are now engaged in (which you yourself admit), but also under\r\nevery other circumstance that can be imagined. For if any man of good\r\njudgment should chance to make a speech on serious matters before the\r\nvery senate of Florence, which is the capital of Tuscany, or even to\r\nconverse privately with a person of weight in that city about important\r\nbusiness, or with his closest friend about affairs of pleasure, with\r\nladies or gentlemen about love, or joking or jesting at feasts, games,\r\nand where you will,—or whatever the time, place or matter,—I am sure he\r\nwould avoid using those antique Tuscan words; and if he did use them,\r\nbesides exciting ridicule, he would give no little annoyance to everyone\r\nwho listened to him.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me then a very strange thing to use as good in writing\r\nthose words that are avoided as faulty in every sort of speaking, and to\r\ninsist that what is never proper in speaking, is the most proper style\r\nthat can be used in writing. For in my opinion writing is really nothing\r\nbut a form of speech, which still remains after we have spoken, as it\r\nwere an image or rather the life of our words: and thus in speech, which\r\nis lost as soon as the sound has gone forth, some things are bearable\r\nperhaps that are not in writing, because writing preserves the words and\r\nsubjects them to the judgment of the reader and gives time to consider\r\nthem advisedly. Hence in writing it is reasonable to take greater pains\r\nto make it more refined and correct; not however in such wise that the\r\nwritten words may be unlike the spoken, but that, in writing, choice be\r\nmade of the most beautiful that are used in speaking. And if that were\r\nallowed in writing which is not allowed in speaking, I think a very\r\ngreat inconvenience would arise: which is that greater license could be\r\ntaken in that respect wherein greater care ought to be taken; and the\r\nindustry bestowed on writing would work harm instead of good.\r\n\r\n“Therefore it is certain that what is proper in writing, is proper also\r\nin speaking, and that manner of speaking is most beautiful which is like\r\nbeautiful writing. Moreover I think it is far more necessary to be\r\nunderstood in writing than in speaking, because those who write are not\r\nalways present before those who read, as those who speak are present\r\nbefore those who hear.[77] But I should praise him, who besides avoiding\r\nmany antique Tuscan words, acquired facility, both writing and speaking,\r\nin the use of those that are to-day familiar in Tuscany and in the other\r\nparts of Italy, and that have comeliness of sound. And I think that\r\nwhoever imposes other rule upon himself, is not very sure of escaping\r\nthat affectation which is so much censured and of which we were speaking\r\nearlier.”\r\n\r\n30.—Then messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“Sir Count, I cannot gainsay you that writing is a kind of speech.\r\nIndeed, I say that if words that are spoken have any obscurity in them,\r\nthe meaning does not penetrate the mind of him who hears, and passing\r\nwithout being understood, comes to naught: which does not occur in\r\nwriting, because if the words that the writer uses carry with them a\r\nlittle, I will not say difficulty, but subtlety that is recondite and\r\nthus not so familiar as are the words that are commonly used in\r\nspeaking,—they give a certain greater authority to the writing, and\r\ncause the reader to proceed more cautiously and collectedly, to consider\r\nmore, and to enjoy the genius and learning of him who writes; and by\r\njudiciously exerting himself a little, he tastes that delight which is\r\nfound in the pursuit of difficult things. And if the ignorance of him\r\nwho reads is so great that he cannot overcome those difficulties, it is\r\nnot the fault of the writer, nor on this account ought that style to be\r\ndeemed unbeautiful.\r\n\r\n“Therefore in writing, I believe it is proper to use Tuscan words used\r\nonly by the ancient Tuscans, because that is great proof and tested by\r\ntime, that they are good and effective to express the sense in which\r\nthey are used. And besides this, they have that grace and venerableness\r\nwhich age lends not only to words, but to buildings, to statues, to\r\npictures, and to everything that is able to attain it, and often merely\r\nby their splendour and dignity they make diction beautiful, by virtue\r\nwhereof (and of grace) every theme, however mean it be, can be so\r\nadorned as to merit very high praise. But this custom of yours, by which\r\nyou set such store, seems to me very dangerous, and often it may be bad;\r\nand if some fault of speech is found widely prevalent among the ignorant\r\nmany, methinks it ought not on this account to be taken as a rule and\r\nfollowed by other men. Moreover customs are very diverse, nor is there a\r\nnoble city of Italy that has not a different manner of speaking from all\r\nthe others. But as you do not limit yourself to declaring which is the\r\nbest, a man might as well adopt the Bergamasque as the Florentine, and\r\naccording to you it would be no errour.[78]\r\n\r\n“Therefore I think that whoever wishes to avoid all doubt and be quite\r\nsafe, must needs select as model someone who by consent of all is rated\r\ngood, and must take him as a constant guide and shield against any\r\npossible adverse critic. And this model (in the vernacular, I mean) I do\r\nnot think should be other than Petrarch[79] and Boccaccio; and whoever\r\ndeparts from these two, gropes like one who walks in the dark without a\r\nlight and thus often mistakes the road. But we are so daring that we do\r\nnot deign to do that which the good writers of old did,—that is, devote\r\nthemselves to imitation, without which I think a man cannot write\r\nwell.[80] And methinks good proof of this is shown us by Virgil, who by\r\nhis genius and judgment so divine took from all posterity the hope of\r\never being able to imitate him well, yet fain would imitate Homer.”\r\n\r\n31.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“This discussion about writing is certainly well worth listening to:\r\nstill it would be more to our purpose if you were to teach us in what\r\nmanner the Courtier ought to speak, for I think he has greater need of\r\nit and more often has occasion to employ speaking than writing.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Nay, for a Courtier so excellent and so perfect there is no doubt but\r\nit is necessary to know both the one and the other, and that without\r\nthese two accomplishments perhaps all the rest would not be very worthy\r\nof praise. So if the Count wishes to perform his duty, he will teach the\r\nCourtier not only how to speak, but also how to write well.”\r\n\r\nThen the Count said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Magnifico, that task I will on no account accept; for great\r\nfolly would be mine to pretend to teach others that which I do not\r\nmyself know, and (even if I did know it) to think myself able to do in\r\nonly a few words that which with so much care and pains has hardly been\r\ndone by most learned men,—to whose works I should refer our Courtier, if\r\nI were indeed bound to teach him how to write and speak.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Magnifico means speaking and writing the vernacular [Italian],\r\nand not Latin; so those works by learned men are not to our purpose. But\r\nin this matter there is need for you to tell us what you know about it,\r\nbecause for the rest we will hold you excused.”\r\n\r\nThe Count replied:\r\n\r\n“I have told you that already; but as we are speaking of the Tuscan\r\ntongue, perhaps it would be, more than any other man’s, my lord\r\nMagnifico’s office to give an opinion on it.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico said:\r\n\r\n“I cannot and in reason ought not to contradict any man who says that\r\nthe Tuscan tongue is more beautiful than the others.[81] It is very true\r\nthat in Petrarch and in Boccaccio are found many words that are now\r\ndiscarded by the custom of to-day; and these I for my part would never\r\nuse either in speaking or in writing; and I believe that they\r\nthemselves, if they had survived until now, would no longer use those\r\nwords.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“Indeed they would. And you Tuscan gentlemen ought to keep up your\r\nmother tongue, and not suffer it to decay, as you do,—so that now one\r\nmay say that there is less knowledge of it in Florence than in many\r\nother parts of Italy.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“These words that are no longer used in Florence have survived among the\r\ncountry folk, and are rejected by the gentle as corrupt and spoiled with\r\nage.”\r\n\r\n32.—Then my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“Let us not wander from our main purpose, but have Count Ludovico teach\r\nthe Courtier how to speak and write well, whether it be in the Tuscan or\r\nany other dialect.”\r\n\r\n“My Lady,” replied the Count, “I have already told what I know about it;\r\nand I hold that the same rules which serve to teach the one, serve also\r\nto teach the other. But since you require it of me, I will make such\r\nresponse as I may to messer Federico, who has a different opinion from\r\nmine; and perhaps I shall have need to discuss the matter somewhat more\r\ndiffusely than is right. However, it shall be all I can tell.\r\n\r\n“And first I say that in my judgment this language of ours, which we\r\ncall vulgar, is still tender and new, although it be already long in\r\nuse. For since Italy was not only vexed and ravaged but long inhabited\r\nby the barbarians, the Latin language was corrupted and spoiled by\r\ncontact with those nations, and from that corruption other languages\r\nwere born: and like rivers that from the crest of the Apennines separate\r\nand flow down into the two seas, so also these languages divided, and\r\nsome of them tinged with Latinity reached by diverse paths, one this\r\ncountry and one that; and one of them remained in Italy tinged with\r\nbarbarism. Thus our language was long unformed and various, from having\r\nhad no one to bestow care upon it or write in it or try to give it\r\nsplendour or grace: but afterwards it was somewhat more cultivated in\r\nTuscany than in the other parts of Italy. And so its flower seems to\r\nhave remained there even from those early times, because that nation\r\nmore than the others preserved a sweet accent and a proper grammatical\r\norder, and have had three noble writers[82] who expressed their thoughts\r\ningeniously and in those words and terms that the custom of their times\r\npermitted: wherein I think Petrarch succeeded more happily than the\r\nothers in amourous subjects.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards from time to time, not only in Tuscany but in all Italy,\r\namong noble men and those well versed in courts and arms and letters,\r\nthere arose some desire to speak and write more elegantly than had been\r\ndone in that rude and uncultivated age, when the blaze of the calamities\r\ninflicted by the barbarians was not yet quenched. Many words were laid\r\naside, as well in the city of Florence itself and in all Tuscany as in\r\nthe rest of Italy, and instead of them others were taken up; and herein\r\nthere thus occurred that change which takes place in all human affairs\r\nand has always happened in the case of the other languages also. For if\r\nthose earliest writings in ancient Latin had survived until now, we\r\nshould see that Evander and Turnus[83] and the other Latins of that age\r\nspoke differently from the last Roman kings and the first consuls. See\r\nhow the verses that the Salian priests chaunted were hardly understood\r\nby posterity;[84] but being established in that form by the first\r\nfounders, out of religious reverence they were not changed. Likewise the\r\norators and poets continued one after another to lay aside many words\r\nused by their predecessors: thus Antonius, Crassus, Hortensius and\r\nCicero avoided many of Cato’s words, and Virgil avoided many of\r\nEnnius’s;[85] and the others did the same. For although they had\r\nreverence for antiquity, yet they did not esteem it so highly as to\r\nconsent to be bound by it in the way you would have us bound by it now.\r\nNay they criticised it where they saw fit, as did Horace, who says that\r\nhis forefathers lauded Plautus foolishly, and thinks he has a right to\r\ngather in new words.[86] And in sundry places Cicero reprehends many of\r\nhis predecessors, and slightingly affirms that Sergius Galba’s orations\r\nhad an antique flavour,[87] and says that Ennius himself disprized his\r\npredecessors in certain things: so that if we would imitate the\r\nancients, in doing so we shall not imitate them. And Virgil, who (you\r\nsay) imitated Homer, did not imitate him in language.\r\n\r\n33.—“Therefore I for my part should always avoid using these antique\r\nwords, save however in certain places, and seldom even there; and it\r\nseems to me that whoever uses them otherwise makes a mistake, not less\r\nthan he who, in order to imitate the ancients, should wish to feed on\r\nacorns when wheat had been discovered in plenty. And since you say that\r\nby their mere splendour of antiquity, antique words so adorn every\r\nsubject, however mean it be, that they can make it worthy of much\r\npraise,—I say that I do not set such store, not only by these antique\r\nwords but even by good ones, as to think that they ought in reason to be\r\nprized without the pith of beautiful thoughts; for to divide thought\r\nfrom words is to divide soul from body, which can be done in neither\r\ncase without destruction.\r\n\r\n“So I think that what is chiefly important and necessary for the\r\nCourtier, in order to speak and write well, is knowledge; for he who is\r\nignorant and has nothing in his mind that merits being heard, can\r\nneither say it nor write it.\r\n\r\n“Next he must arrange in good order what he has to say or write; then\r\nexpress it well in words, which (if I do not err) ought to be precise,\r\nchoice, rich and rightly formed, but above all, in use even among the\r\nmasses; because such words as these make the grandeur and pomp of\r\nspeech, if the speaker has good sense and carefulness, and knows how to\r\nchoose the words most expressive of his meaning, and to exalt them, to\r\nmould them like wax to his will, and to arrange them in such position\r\nand order that they shall at a glance show and make known their dignity\r\nand splendour, like pictures placed in good and proper light.\r\n\r\n“And this I say as well of writing as of speaking: in which however some\r\nthings are required that are not needful in writing,—such as a good\r\nvoice, not too thin and soft like a woman’s, nor yet so stern and rough\r\nas to smack of the rustic’s,—but sonorous, clear, sweet and well\r\nsounding, with distinct enunciation, and with proper bearing and\r\ngestures; which I think consist in certain movements of the whole body,\r\nnot affected or violent, but tempered by a calm face and with a play of\r\nthe eyes that shall give an effect of grace, accord with the words, and\r\nas far as possible express also, together with the gestures, the\r\nspeaker’s intent and feeling.\r\n\r\n“But all these things would be vain and of small moment, if the thoughts\r\nexpressed by the words were not beautiful, ingenious, acute, elegant and\r\ngrave,—according to the need.”\r\n\r\n34.—Then my lord Morello said:\r\n\r\n“If this Courtier speaks with so much elegance and grace, I doubt if\r\nanyone will be found among us who will understand him.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, he will be understood by everyone,” replied the Count, “because\r\nfacility is no impediment to elegance.\r\n\r\n“Nor would I have him speak always of grave matters, but of amusing\r\nthings, of games, jests and waggery, according to the occasion; but\r\nsensibly of everything, and with readiness and lucid fullness; and in no\r\nplace let him show vanity or childish folly. And again when he is\r\nspeaking on an obscure or difficult subject, I would have him carefully\r\nexplain his meaning with precision of both word and thought, and make\r\nevery ambiguity clear and plain with a certain touch of unpedantic care.\r\nLikewise, where there is occasion, let him know how to speak with\r\ndignity and force, to arouse those emotions that are part of our nature,\r\nand to kindle them or to move them according to the need. Sometimes,\r\nwith that simple candour that makes it seem as if nature herself were\r\nspeaking, let him know how to soften them, and as it were to intoxicate\r\nthem with sweetness, and so easily withal that the listener shall think\r\nthat with very little effort he too could reach that excellence, and\r\nwhen he tries, shall find himself very far behind.\r\n\r\n“In such fashion would I have our Courtier speak and write; and not only\r\nchoose rich and elegant words from every part of Italy, but I should\r\neven praise him for sometimes using some of those French and Spanish\r\nterms that are already accepted by our custom.[88] Thus it would not\r\ndisplease me if on occasion he were to say, _primor_ (excellence); or\r\n_acertare_ (to succeed), _aventurare_ (to run a risk successfully); or\r\n_ripassare una persona con ragionamento_, meaning to sound a person and\r\nto talk with him in order to gain perfect knowledge of him; or _un\r\ncavalier senza rimproccio_ (a cavalier without reproach), _attilato_\r\n(elegant), _creato d’un principe_ (a prince’s creature), and other like\r\nterms, provided he might hope to be understood.[89]\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I would have him use a few words in a sense other than that\r\nproper to them, to transpose them aptly, and as it were to graft them,\r\nlike the branch of a tree, upon a more appropriate trunk,—so as to make\r\nthem more attractive and beautiful, and as it were to bring things\r\nwithin the range of our vision, and within hand-touch as we say, to the\r\ndelight of him who hears or reads. Nor would I have him scruple to form\r\nnew words and in new figures of speech, deriving them tastefully from\r\nthe Latins, as of old the Latins derived them from the Greeks.\r\n\r\n35.—“Now if among the lettered men of good talent and judgment who\r\nto-day are found in our midst, there were a few who would take care to\r\nwrite in this language (as I have described) things worthy of being\r\nread, we should soon see it studied and abounding in beautiful terms and\r\nfigures, and capable of being written in as well as is any other\r\nwhatsoever; and if it were not pure old Tuscan, it would be\r\nItalian,—universal, copious and varied, and in a way like a delightful\r\ngarden full of various flowers and fruits. Nor would this be a novel\r\nthing; for from the four dialects that the Greek writers had in use,[90]\r\nthey culled words, forms and figures from each as they saw fit, and\r\nthence they brought forth another dialect which was called ‘common,’ and\r\nlater they called all five by the single name Greek. And although the\r\nAttic dialect was more elegant, pure and copious than the others, good\r\nwriters who were not Athenians by birth did not so affect it as to be\r\nunrecognizable by their style and by the perfume (as it were) and\r\nessence of their native speech. Nor yet were they disprized for this; on\r\nthe contrary those who tried to seem too Athenian, were censured for it.\r\nAmong the Latin writers too, many non-Romans were highly esteemed in\r\ntheir day, although there was not found in them that typical purity of\r\nthe Roman tongue which men of other race can rarely acquire. Thus Titus\r\nLivius was not at all discarded, although someone professed to have\r\ndetected a Paduan flavour in him;[91] nor was Virgil, albeit reproached\r\nwith not speaking Roman. Moreover, as you know, many writers of\r\nbarbarian race were read and esteemed at Rome.\r\n\r\n“We, on the contrary, much more strict than the ancients, needlessly\r\nimpose certain new laws upon ourselves, and with the beaten highways\r\nbefore our eyes, we seek to go along the by-paths; for in our own\r\nlanguage,—of which, as of all others, the office is to express thought\r\nwell and clearly,—we delight ourselves with obscurity; and calling it\r\nthe vulgar tongue, we try in speaking it to use words that are\r\nunderstood neither by the vulgar nor yet by the gentle and lettered, and\r\nare no longer used in any place; unmindful that all the good writers of\r\nold disapproved words discarded by custom. Which to my thinking, you do\r\nnot rightly understand; since you say that if some fault of speech is\r\nwidely prevalent among the ignorant, it ought not for that reason to be\r\ncalled custom or accepted as a rule of speech, and from what I have\r\nheard you sometimes say, you would have us use _Campidoglio_ in place of\r\n_Capitolio_; _Girolamo_ for _Hieronymo_; _aldace_ for _audace_; and\r\n_padrone_ for _patrone_, and other words corrupt and spoiled like these;\r\nbecause they are found written thus by some ignorant old Tuscan, and\r\nbecause the Tuscan country folk speak thus to-day.[92]\r\n\r\n“Hence I believe that good custom in speech springs from men who have\r\ntalent and who have gained good judgment from study and experience, and\r\nwho therefore agree and consent to accept the words that to them seem\r\ngood, which are recognized by a certain innate judgment and not by any\r\nart or rule. Do you not know that figures of speech, which give so much\r\ngrace and splendour to an oration, are all infringements of grammatical\r\nrules, yet accepted and confirmed by usage, because, although unable to\r\noffer other reason, they give pleasure and seem to carry suavity and\r\nsweetness to our very sense of hearing? And this I believe to be good\r\ncustom,—of which the Romans, the Neapolitans, the Lombards and the rest,\r\nmay be as capable as the Tuscans are.\r\n\r\n36.—“It is very true that in every language certain things are always\r\ngood, such as ease, good order, richness, beautiful sentences,\r\nharmonious periods; and on the contrary affectation and other things\r\nopposed to these, are bad. But among words there are some that remain\r\ngood for a time, then grow antiquated and wholly lose their grace;\r\nothers gain strength and come to be esteemed. For as the seasons of the\r\nyear despoil the earth of flowers and fruits and then clothe it anew\r\nwith others, so time causes those primal words to decay, and use makes\r\nothers to be born again and gives them grace and dignity, until they in\r\ntheir turn meet their death, consumed by the envious gnawing of time;\r\nfor in the end both we and all our concerns are mortal. Consider that we\r\nno longer have any knowledge of the Oscan tongue.[93] The Provençal,\r\nalthough it may be said to have been but lately celebrated by noble\r\nwriters, is not now understood by the inhabitants of that country. Hence\r\nI think, as my lord Magnifico has well said, that if Petrarch and\r\nBoccaccio were alive at this time, they would not use many words that we\r\nfind in their writings: therefore it does not seem to me well for us to\r\ncopy these words. I applaud very highly those who know how to imitate\r\nthat which ought to be imitated, but I do not at all believe that it is\r\nimpossible to write well without imitating,—and particularly in this\r\nlanguage of ours, wherein we may be aided by usage: which I should not\r\ndare say of Latin.”\r\n\r\n37.—The messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“Why would you have usage more esteemed in the vernacular than in\r\nLatin?”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied the Count, “I esteem usage as mistress of both the one\r\nand the other. But since those men to whom the Latin tongue was as\r\nnatural as the vernacular now is to us, are no longer on earth, we must\r\nneeds learn from their writings that which they learned from usage. Nor\r\ndoes ancient speech mean anything more than ancient usage of speech, and\r\nit would be a silly business to like ancient speech for no other reason\r\nthan a wish to speak as men used to speak rather than as they now\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied messer Federico, “the ancients did not imitate?”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said the Count, “that many of them did, but not in\r\neverything. And if Virgil had imitated Hesiod in everything, he would\r\nnot have surpassed his master; nor Cicero, Crassus; nor Ennius, his\r\npredecessors. You know Homer is so ancient that many believe he is the\r\nfirst heroic poet in time as he is also in excellence of diction: and\r\nwhom would you think he imitated?”\r\n\r\n“Some other poet,” replied messer Federico, “more ancient than he, of\r\nwhom we have no knowledge because of excessive antiquity.”\r\n\r\n“Then whom,” said the Count, “would you say Petrarch and Boccaccio\r\nimitated, who were on earth only three days since, one may say?”\r\n\r\n“I know not,” replied messer Federico; “but we may believe that even\r\ntheir minds were directed to imitation, although we do not know of\r\nwhom.”\r\n\r\nThe Count replied:\r\n\r\n“We may believe that they who were imitated, surpassed those who\r\nimitated them; and if they were admirable, it would be too great a\r\nmarvel that their name and fame should be so soon extinguished. But I\r\nbelieve that their real master was aptitude and their own native\r\njudgment; and at this there is no one who ought to wonder, since nearly\r\nalways the summit of every excellence may be approached by diverse\r\nroads. Nor is there anything that has not in it many things of the same\r\nsort which are dissimilar and yet intrinsically deserving of equal\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n“Consider music, the harmonies of which are now grave and slow, now very\r\nfast and of novel moods and means; yet all give pleasure, albeit for\r\ndifferent reasons: as is seen in Bidon’s[94] manner of singing, which is\r\nso skilful, ready, vehement, fervid, and of such varied melodies, that\r\nthe listener’s spirits are moved and inflamed, and thus entranced seem\r\nto be lifted up to heaven. Nor does our friend Marchetto Cara[95] move\r\nus less by his singing, but with a gentler harmony; because he softens\r\nand penetrates our souls by placid means and full of plaintive\r\nsweetness, gently stirring them to sweet emotion.\r\n\r\n“Again, various things give equal pleasure to our eyes, so that we can\r\nwith difficulty decide which are more pleasing to them. You know that in\r\npainting Leonardo da Vinci,[96] Mantegna,[97] Raphael,[98] Michelangelo,\r\n[99] Giorgio da Castelfranco,[100] are very excellent, yet they are all\r\nunlike in their work; so that no one of them seems to lack anything in\r\nhis own manner, since each is known as most perfect in his style.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANGELO AMBROGINI\r\n  POLIZIANO\r\n  1454-1494\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Anderson’s photograph (no. 8148) of a part of the fresco,\r\n    “Zacharias in the Temple,” in the Church of Santa Maria Novella at\r\n    Florence, by Domenico Bigordi, better known as Ghirlandajo,\r\n    (1449-1494).\r\n\r\n“It is the same with many Greek and Latin poets, who, although different\r\nin their writing, are equal in their fame. The orators, too, have always\r\nhad so much diversity among themselves, that almost every age has\r\nproduced and prized a type of orator peculiar to its own time; and these\r\nhave been different not only from their predecessors and successors, but\r\nfrom one another: as it is written of Isocrates, Lysias, Æschines,[101]\r\nand many others among the Greeks,—all excellent, yet each resembling no\r\none but himself. So, among the Latins, Carbo, Lælius, Scipio Africanus,\r\nGalba, Sulpicius, Cotta, Gracchus, Marcus Antonius, Crassus,[102] and so\r\nmany others that it would be tedious to name them,—all good and very\r\ndifferent one from another; so that if a man were able to consider all\r\nthe orators that have been in the world, he would find as many kinds of\r\noratory as of orators. I think I remember too that Cicero in a certain\r\nplace[103] makes Marcus Antonius say to Sulpicius that there are many\r\nwho imitate no man and yet arrive at the highest pitch of excellence;\r\nand he speaks of certain ones who had introduced a new form and figure\r\nof speech, beautiful but not usual among the orators of that time,\r\nwherein they imitated no one but themselves. For that reason he affirms\r\nalso that masters ought to consider the pupils’ nature, and taking this\r\nas guide ought to direct and aid them to the path towards which their\r\naptitude and natural disposition incline them. Hence I believe, dear\r\nmesser Federico, that if a man has no innate affinity for any particular\r\nauthor, it is not well to force him to imitate, because the vigour[104]\r\nof his faculty languishes and is impeded when turned from the channel in\r\nwhich it would have made progress had that channel not been barred.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I do not see how it can be well, instead of enriching this\r\nlanguage of ours and giving it spirit and grandeur and light, to make it\r\npoor, thin, humble and obscure, and to try to restrict it in such narrow\r\nbounds that everyone shall be forced to imitate Petrarch and Boccaccio\r\nalone; and how, in respect of language, we ought not also to give\r\ncredence to Poliziano,[105] to Lorenzo de’ Medici,[106] to Francesco\r\nDiacceto,[107] and to some others who are also Tuscans and perhaps of no\r\nless learning and judgment than were Petrarch and Boccaccio. And great\r\npity would it be indeed to set a limit, and not to surpass that which\r\nalmost the earliest writers achieved, and to deny that so many men of\r\nsuch noble genius can ever find more than one beautiful form of\r\nexpression in this language which is proper and natural to them. But\r\nto-day there are certain scrupulous souls, who so frighten the listener\r\nwith the cult and ineffable mysteries of this Tuscan tongue of theirs,\r\nas to put even many a noble and learned man in such fear, that he dare\r\nnot open his mouth and confesses that he does not know how to speak the\r\nvery language which he learned in swaddling clothes from his nurse.\r\n\r\n“However I think we have said only too much of this; so now let us go on\r\nwith our discussion about the Courtier.”\r\n\r\n38.—Then messer Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“I should first like to say one thing more, which is that I do not deny\r\nmen’s opinions and aptitudes to be different among themselves. Nor do I\r\nbelieve that it would be well for a naturally vehement and excitable man\r\nto set himself to write of placid themes, or for another, being severe\r\nand grave, to write jests; for in this matter it seems to me reasonable\r\nthat everyone should adapt himself to his own proper instinct. And I\r\nthink Cicero was speaking of this when he said that masters ought to\r\nhave regard to their pupils’ nature, in order not to act like bad\r\nhusbandmen, who will sometimes sow grain in land that is fruitful only\r\nfor the vine.\r\n\r\n“Still I cannot get it into my head why, in the case of a particular\r\nlanguage,—which is not proper to all men equally, like speech and\r\nthought and many other functions, but an invention of limited use,—it is\r\nnot more rational to imitate those who speak better, than to speak at\r\nrandom; or why, just as in Latin we ought to try to approach the\r\nlanguage of Virgil and Cicero rather than that of Silius or Cornelius\r\nTacitus,[108] it is not better in the vernacular also to imitate the\r\nlanguage of Petrarch and Boccaccio than any other’s; yet to express our\r\nthoughts in it well, and thus to give heed to our own natural instinct,\r\nas Cicero teaches. And in this way it will be found that the difference\r\nwhich you say there is among good orators, consists in sense and not in\r\nlanguage.”\r\n\r\nThen the Count said:\r\n\r\n“I fear we shall be entering on a wide sea, and shall be leaving our\r\nfirst subject of the Courtier. However, I ask you in what consists the\r\nexcellence of this language?”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“In preserving strictly its proprieties, in giving it that sense, and in\r\nusing that style and those rhythms, which have been used by all who have\r\nwritten well.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know,” said the Count, “whether this style and these\r\nrhythms of which you speak, arise from the thought or from the words.”\r\n\r\n“From the words,” replied messer Federico.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the Count, “do not the words of Silius and Cornelius\r\nTacitus seem to you the same that Virgil and Cicero use? and employed in\r\nthe same sense?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly they are the same,” replied messer Federico, “but some of\r\nthem wrongly applied and turned awry.”\r\n\r\nThe Count replied:\r\n\r\n“And if from a book of Cornelius and from one of Silius, all those words\r\nwere removed that are used in a sense different from that of Virgil and\r\nCicero, which would be very few,—would you not then say that Cornelius\r\nwas the equal of Cicero in language, and Silius of Virgil, and that it\r\nwould be well to imitate their manner of speech?”\r\n\r\n39.—Then my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks this debate of yours is far too long and tedious; therefore it\r\nwere well to postpone it to another time.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico was about to reply none the less, but my lady Emilia\r\nalways interrupted him. At last the Count said:\r\n\r\n“Many men like to pass judgment upon style and to talk about rhythms and\r\nimitation; but they cannot make it at all clear to me what manner of\r\nthing style or rhythm is, or in what imitation consists, or why things\r\ntaken from Homer or from someone else are so becoming in Virgil that\r\nthey seem illumined rather than imitated. Perhaps this is because I am\r\nnot capable of understanding them; but since a good sign that a man\r\nknows a thing, is his ability to teach it, I suspect that they too\r\nunderstand it but little, and that they praise both Virgil and Cicero\r\nbecause they hear such praise from many, not because they perceive the\r\ndifference that exists between these two and others: for in truth it\r\ndoes not consist in preserving two or three or ten words used in a way\r\ndifferent from the others.\r\n\r\n“In Sallust, Cæsar, Varro[109] and the other good writers, some terms\r\nare found used differently from the way Cicero uses them; and yet both\r\nways are proper, for the excellence and force of a language lie in no\r\nsuch trifling matter: as Demosthenes well said to Æschines, who\r\ntauntingly asked him whether certain words that he had used (although\r\nnot Attic) were prodigies or portents; and Demosthenes laughed and\r\nreplied that the fortunes of Greece did not hang on such a trifle. So I\r\ntoo should care little if I were reproved by a Tuscan for having said\r\n_satisfatto_ rather than _sodisfatto_, _honorevole_ for _horrevole_,\r\n_causa_ for _cagione_, _populo_ for _popolo_, and the like.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico rose to his feet and said:\r\n\r\n“Hear me these few words, I pray.”\r\n\r\n“The pain of my displeasure,” replied my lady Emilia, laughing, “be upon\r\nhim who speaks more of this matter now, for I wish to postpone it to\r\nanother evening. But do you, Count, go on with the discussion about the\r\nCourtier,—and show us what a fine memory you have, which I think you\r\nwill do in no small measure, if you are able to take up the discussion\r\nwhere you left it.”\r\n\r\n40.—“My Lady,” replied the Count, “I fear the thread is broken; yet if I\r\nam not wrong, methinks we were saying that the pest of affectation\r\nimparts extreme ungracefulness to everything, while on the other hand\r\nsimplicity and nonchalance produce the height of grace: in praise of\r\nwhich, and in blame of affectation, we might cite many other arguments;\r\nbut of these I wish to add only one, and no more. Women are always very\r\neager to be—and when they cannot be, at least to seem—beautiful. So\r\nwhere nature is somewhat at fault in this regard, they try to piece it\r\nout by artifice; whence arise that painting of the face with so much\r\ncare and sometimes pains, that plucking of the eyebrows and forehead,\r\nand the use of all those devices and the endurance of that trouble,\r\nwhich you ladies think to keep very secret from men, but which are all\r\nwell known.”\r\n\r\nHere madonna Costanza Fregosa laughed and said:\r\n\r\n“It would be far more courteous for you to keep to your discussion, and\r\ntell us of what grace is born, and talk about Courtiership,—than to try\r\nto unveil the weaknesses of women, which are not to the purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, much to the purpose,” replied the Count: “for these weaknesses of\r\nyours I am speaking of, deprive you of grace because they spring from\r\nnothing but affectation, wherein you openly make known to everyone your\r\nover-eagerness to be beautiful.\r\n\r\n“Do you not see how much more grace a lady has who paints (if at all) so\r\nsparingly and so little, that whoever sees her is in doubt whether she\r\nbe painted or not; than another lady so plastered that she seems to have\r\nput a mask upon her face and dares not laugh for fear of cracking it,\r\nnor ever changes colour but when she dresses in the morning, and then\r\nstands motionless all the rest of the day like a wooden image, showing\r\nherself only by candle-light, like wily merchants who display their\r\ncloths in a dark place? Again, how much more pleasing than all others is\r\none (I mean not ill-favoured) who is plainly seen to have nothing on her\r\nface, although it be neither very white nor very red, but by nature a\r\nlittle pale and sometimes tinged with an honest flush from shame or\r\nother accident,—with hair artlessly unadorned and hardly confined, her\r\ngestures simple and free, without showing care or wish to be beautiful!\r\nThis is that nonchalant simplicity most pleasing to the eyes and minds\r\nof men, who are ever fearful of being deceived by art.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful teeth are very charming in a woman, for since they are not so\r\nmuch in view as the face is, but lie hidden most of the time, we may\r\nbelieve that less care is taken to make them beautiful than with the\r\nface. Yet if one were to laugh without cause and solely to display the\r\nteeth, he would betray his art, and however beautiful they were, would\r\nseem most ungraceful to all, like Catullus’s Egnatius.[110] It is the\r\nsame with the hands; which, if they are delicate and beautiful, and\r\noccasionally left bare when there is need to use them, and not in order\r\nto display their beauty, they leave a very great desire to see more of\r\nthem, and especially if covered with gloves again; for whoever covers\r\nthem seems to have little care or thought whether they be seen or not,\r\nand to have them thus beautiful more by nature than by any effort or\r\npains.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever noticed when a woman, in passing through the street to\r\nchurch or elsewhere, thoughtlessly happens (either in frolic or from\r\nother cause) to lift her dress high enough to show the foot and often a\r\nlittle of the leg? Does this not seem to you full of grace, when you see\r\nher tricked out with a touch of feminine daintiness in velvet shoes and\r\nneat stockings? I for one delight in it and believe you all do, for\r\neveryone is persuaded that elegance, in matters thus hidden and rarely\r\nseen, is natural and instinctive to the lady rather than forced, and\r\nthat she does not think to win any praise by it.\r\n\r\n41.—“In this way we avoid and hide affectation, and you can now see how\r\nopposed and destructive it is to grace in every office as well of the\r\nbody as the mind: whereof we have thus far spoken little, and yet we\r\nmust not omit it, for since the mind is of far more worth than the body,\r\nit deserves to be more cultivated and adorned. And as to what ought to\r\nbe done in the case of our Courtier, we will lay aside the precepts of\r\nthe many sage philosophers who write of this matter and define the\r\nproperties of the mind and discuss so subtly about their rank,—and\r\nkeeping to our subject, we will in a few words declare it to be enough\r\nthat he be (as we say) an honest and upright man; for in this are\r\nincluded prudence, goodness, strength and temperance of mind, and all\r\nthe other qualities that are proper to a name so honoured. And I esteem\r\nhim alone to be a true moral philosopher, who wishes to be good; and in\r\nthis regard he needs few other precepts than that wish. And therefore\r\nSocrates was right in saying that he thought his teachings bore good\r\nfruit indeed whenever they incited anyone to understand and teach\r\nvirtue: for they who have reached the goal of desiring nothing more\r\nardently than to be good, easily acquire knowledge of everything needful\r\ntherefor; so we will discuss this no further.\r\n\r\n42.—“Yet besides goodness, I think that letters are for everyone the\r\ntrue and principal ornament of the mind: although the French recognize\r\nonly the nobility of arms and esteem all else as naught. Thus they not\r\nonly fail to prize but they abhor letters, and hold all men of letters\r\nmost base, and think they speak very basely of any man when they call\r\nhim a clerk.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MONSEIGNEUR D’ANGOULÊME\r\n  AFTERWARD FRANCIS I OF FRANCE\r\n  1494-1547\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a negative, specially made by Alinari through the courtesy\r\n    of Professor I. B. Supino, of an anonymous medal in the National\r\n    Museum at Florence.\r\n\r\nThen the Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“You say truly, that this fault has long been prevalent among the\r\nFrench. But if kind fate decrees that Monseigneur d’Angoulême[111] shall\r\nsucceed to the crown, as is hoped, I think that just as the glory of\r\narms flourishes and shines in France, so too ought that of letters to\r\nflourish in highest state; for it is not long since I, being at the\r\ncourt, saw this prince, and it seemed to me that besides the grace of\r\nhis person and the beauty of his face, he had in his aspect such\r\nloftiness, joined however with a certain gracious humanity, that the\r\nrealm of France must always seem small for him. I heard afterwards from\r\nmany gentlemen, both French and Italian, of his very noble manner of\r\nlife, of his loftiness of mind, of his valour and liberality. And among\r\nother things I was told that he loved and esteemed letters especially\r\nand held all men of letters in greatest honour; and he condemned the\r\nFrench themselves for being so hostile to this profession, especially as\r\nthey have within their borders such a noble school as that of Paris,\r\nfrequented by all the world.”[112]\r\n\r\nThen the Count said:\r\n\r\n“It is a great marvel that in such tender youth, solely by natural\r\ninstinct and against the usage of his country, he has of himself chosen\r\nso worthy a path. And as subjects always copy the customs of their\r\nsuperiours, it may be that, as you say, the French will yet come to\r\nesteem letters at their true worth: whereto they may easily be\r\npersuaded, if they will but listen to reason; since nothing is by nature\r\nmore desirable for men, or more proper to them, than knowledge, which it\r\nis great folly to say or believe is not always a good thing.\r\n\r\n43.—“And if I were speaking with them, or with others who had an opinion\r\ncontrary to mine, I should strive to show them how useful and necessary\r\nletters are to our life and dignity, having indeed been granted by God\r\nto men as a crowning gift. Nor should I lack instances of many excellent\r\ncommanders of antiquity, who all added the ornament of letters to the\r\nvalour of their arms.\r\n\r\n“Thus you know Alexander held Homer in such veneration that he always\r\nkept the Iliad by his bedside; and he devoted the greatest attention not\r\nonly to these studies but to philosophical speculation under Aristotle’s\r\nguidance. Alcibiades enlarged his natural aptitudes and made them\r\ngreater by means of letters and the teachings of Socrates. The care that\r\nCæsar gave to study is also attested by the surviving works that he\r\ndivinely wrote. It is said that Scipio Africanus always kept in his hand\r\nthe works of Xenophon, wherein the perfect king is portrayed under the\r\nname of Cyrus. I could tell you of Lucullus, Sulla, Pompey, Brutus,[113]\r\nand many other Romans and Greeks; but I will merely remind you that\r\nHannibal, the illustrious commander,—although fierce by nature and a\r\nstranger to all humanity, faithless and a despiser of both men and\r\ngods,—yet had knowledge of letters and was conversant with the Greek\r\nlanguage; and if I mistake not, I once read that he even left a book\r\ncomposed by him in Greek.\r\n\r\n“However it is superfluous to tell you this, for I well know that you\r\nall see how wrong the French are in thinking that letters are injurious\r\nto arms. You know that glory is the true stimulus to great and hazardous\r\ndeeds of war, and whoso is moved thereto by gain or other motive,\r\nbesides doing nothing good, deserves not to be called a gentleman, but a\r\nbase trafficker. And true glory is that which is preserved in the sacred\r\ntreasure-house of letters, as everyone may understand except those\r\nunfortunates who have never enjoyed them.\r\n\r\n“What soul is there so abject, timid and humble, that when he reads of\r\nthe deeds of Cæsar, Alexander, Scipio, Hannibal, and many others, is not\r\ninflamed by an ardent desire to be like them, and does not make small\r\naccount of this frail two days’ life, in order to win the almost eternal\r\nlife of fame, which in spite of death makes him live in far greater\r\nglory than before? But he who does not feel the delight of letters,\r\ncannot either know how great is the glory they so long preserve, and\r\nmeasures it by the life of one man or two, because his memory runs no\r\nfurther. Hence he cannot esteem this short-lived glory so much as he\r\nwould that almost eternal glory if knowledge of it were unhappily not\r\ndenied him, and as he does not esteem it so much, we may reasonably\r\nbelieve that he will not run such danger to pursue it as one who knew it\r\nwould.\r\n\r\n“I should be far from willing to have an antagonist cite instances to\r\nthe contrary in refutation of my view, and urge upon me that with all\r\ntheir knowledge of letters the Italians have for some time since shown\r\nlittle martial valour,—which is alas only too true.[114] But it very\r\ncertainly might be said that the fault of a few has brought not only\r\ngrievous harm but eternal obloquy upon all the rest; and from them was\r\nderived the true cause of our ruin and of the decadence if not the death\r\nof valour in our souls: yet it would be far more shameful in us to\r\npublish it, than for the French to be ignorant of letters. Therefore it\r\nis better to pass over in silence that which cannot be recalled without\r\npain: and avoiding this subject (upon which I entered against my will)\r\nto return to our Courtier.\r\n\r\n44.—“I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at\r\nleast in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant\r\nnot only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the\r\nmany different things that have been admirably written therein.[115] Let\r\nhim be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and\r\nhistorians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially\r\nin this vulgar tongue of ours;[116] for besides the enjoyment he will\r\nfind in it, he will by this means never lack agreeable entertainment\r\nwith ladies,[117] who are usually fond of such things. And if other\r\noccupations or want of study prevent his reaching such perfection as to\r\nrender his writings worthy of great praise, let him be careful to\r\nsuppress them so that others may not laugh at him, and let him show them\r\nonly to a friend whom he can trust: because they will at least be of\r\nthis service to him, that the exercise will enable him to judge the work\r\nof others. For it very rarely happens that a man who is not accustomed\r\nto write, however learned he may be, can ever quite appreciate the toil\r\nand industry of writers, or taste the sweetness and excellence of style,\r\nand those latent niceties that are often found in the ancients.\r\n\r\n“Moreover these studies will also make him fluent, and as Aristippus\r\nsaid to the tyrant, confident and assured in speaking with\r\neveryone.[118] Hence I would have our Courtier keep one precept fixed in\r\nmind; which is that in this and everything else he should be always on\r\nhis guard, and diffident rather than forward, and that he should keep\r\nfrom falsely persuading himself that he knows that which he does not\r\nknow. For by nature we all are fonder of praise than we ought to be, and\r\nour ears love the melody of words that praise us more than any other\r\nsweet song or sound; and thus, like sirens’ voices, they are often the\r\ncause of shipwreck to him who does not close his ears to such deceptive\r\nharmony. Among the ancient sages this danger was recognized, and books\r\nwere written showing in what way the true friend may be distinguished\r\nfrom the flatterer.[119] But what does this avail, if there be many, nay\r\na host, of those who clearly perceive that they are flattered, yet love\r\nhim who flatters them, and hold him in hatred who tells them the truth?\r\nAnd often when they find him who praises them too sparing in his words,\r\nthey even help him and say such things of themselves, that the flatterer\r\nis put to shame, most impudent though he be.\r\n\r\n“Let us leave these blind ones to their errour, and have our Courtier of\r\nsuch good judgment that he will not take black for white, or have more\r\nself-confidence than he clearly knows to be well founded; and especially\r\nin those peculiarities which (if you remember) messer Cesare in his game\r\nsaid we had often used as an instrument to bring men’s folly to light.\r\nOn the contrary, even if he well knows the praises bestowed upon him to\r\nbe true, let him not err by accepting them too openly or confirming them\r\nwithout some protest; but rather let him as it were disclaim them\r\nmodestly, always showing and really esteeming arms as his chief\r\nprofession, and all other good accomplishments as an ornament thereto.\r\nAnd particularly among soldiers let him not act like those who insist on\r\nseeming soldiers in learning, and learned men among soldiers. In this\r\nway, for the reasons we have alleged, he will avoid affectation, and\r\neven the middling things that he does, shall seem very great.”\r\n\r\n45.—Messer Pietro Bembo here replied:\r\n\r\n“Count, I do not see why you insist that this Courtier, being lettered\r\nand endowed with so many other admirable accomplishments, should hold\r\neverything as an ornament of arms, and not arms and the rest as an\r\nornament of letters; which without other accompaniment are as superiour\r\nin dignity to arms, as the mind is to the body, for the practice of them\r\nproperly pertains to the mind, as that of arms does to the body.”\r\n\r\nThen the Count replied:\r\n\r\n“Nay, the practice of arms pertains to both mind and body. But I would\r\nnot have you judge in such a cause, messer Pietro, for you would be too\r\nmuch suspected of bias by one of the two sides: and as the controversy\r\nhas already been long waged by very wise men, there is no need to renew\r\nit; but I regard it as settled in favour of arms, and would have our\r\nCourtier so regard it too, since I may form him as I wish. And if you\r\nare of contrary mind, wait till you hear of a contest wherein he who\r\ndefends the cause of arms is allowed to use arms, just as those who\r\ndefend letters make use of letters in their defence; for if everyone\r\navails himself of his proper weapons, you shall see that men of letters\r\nwill be worsted.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said messer Pietro, “a while ago you blamed the French for prizing\r\nletters little, and told what glorious lustre is shed on man by letters\r\nand how they make him immortal; and now it seems you have changed your\r\nmind. Do you not remember that\r\n\r\n           Before the famous tomb of brave Achilles\r\n             Thus spake the mighty Alexander, sighing:\r\n             ‘O happy youth, who found so clear a trumpet,\r\n             And lofty bard to make thy deeds undying!’[120]\r\n\r\nAnd if Alexander envied Achilles not for his deeds, but for the fortune\r\nthat had granted him the happiness of having his exploits celebrated by\r\nHomer, we may conclude that Alexander esteemed Homer’s poems above\r\nAchilles’s arms. For what other judge do you wait then, or for what\r\nother sentence upon the dignity of arms and letters, than that\r\npronounced by one of the greatest commanders that have ever been?”\r\n\r\n46.—Then the Count replied:\r\n\r\n“I blame the French for thinking that letters are a hindrance to the\r\nprofession of arms, and I hold that learning is more proper to no one\r\nthan to a warrior; and in our Courtier I would have these two\r\naccomplishments joined and each aided by the other, as is most proper:\r\nnor do I think I have changed my mind in this. But as I said, I do not\r\nwish to discuss which of the two is more worthy of praise. It is enough\r\nthat men of letters almost never select for praise any but great men and\r\nglorious deeds, which in themselves merit praise for the mere essential\r\nquality from which they spring; besides this they are very noble\r\nmaterial for writers: which is a great ornament, and in part the cause\r\nof perpetuating writings, which perhaps would not be so much read and\r\nappreciated if they lacked their noble theme, but vain and of little\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“And if Alexander was envious that Achilles should be praised by Homer,\r\nit does not therefore follow that he esteemed letters above arms;\r\nwherein if he had felt himself as far behind Achilles as he deemed all\r\nthose who wrote of him were behind Homer, I am sure he would far rather\r\nhave desired fine acts on his part than fine speeches on the part of\r\nothers. Hence I believe that saying of his to have been a tacit eulogy\r\nof himself, and that he was expressing a desire for what he thought he\r\ndid not possess (that is, the supreme excellence of a writer), and not\r\nfor what he believed he already had attained (that is, prowess in arms,\r\nwherein he did not deem Achilles at all his superior). Thus he called\r\nAchilles happy, as if hinting that although his own fame had hitherto\r\nnot been so celebrated in the world as Achilles’s, which was made bright\r\nand illustrious by that poem so divine,—it was not because his valour\r\nand merits were less or deserving of less praise, but because fortune\r\nbestowed upon Achilles that miracle of nature as a glorious trumpet for\r\nhis achievements. Perhaps also he wished to incite some noble genius to\r\nwrite about him, by showing that this must be as pleasing to him as were\r\nhis love and veneration for the sacred monuments of letters: whereof we\r\nhave spoken long enough for the present.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, too long,” replied my lord Ludovico Pio; “for I believe that in\r\nthe whole world it would be impossible to find a receptacle large enough\r\nto hold all the things you would have in our Courtier.”\r\n\r\nThen the Count said:\r\n\r\n“Wait a little, for there are many more that he must have.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” replied Pietro da Napoli, “Grasso de’ Medici would have\r\na great advantage over messer Pietro Bembo.”[121]\r\n\r\n47.—Here everyone laughed, and the Count began anew and said:\r\n\r\n“My lords, you must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless\r\nhe be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able\r\nto read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. For if we consider\r\nrightly, there is to be found no rest from toil or medicine for the\r\ntroubled spirit more becoming and praiseworthy in time of leisure, than\r\nthis; and especially in courts, where besides the relief from tedium\r\nthat music affords us all, many things are done to please the ladies,\r\nwhose tender and gentle spirit is easily penetrated by harmony and\r\nfilled with sweetness. Thus it is no marvel that in both ancient and\r\nmodern times they have always been inclined to favour musicians, and\r\nhave found refreshing spiritual food in music.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I admit that music as well as many other vanities may be proper to\r\nwomen and perhaps to some that have the semblance of men, but not to\r\nthose who really are men; for these ought not to enervate their mind\r\nwith delights and thus induce therein a fear of death.”\r\n\r\n“Say not so,” replied the Count; “for I shall enter upon a vast sea in\r\npraise of music. And I shall call to mind how it was always celebrated\r\nand held sacred among the ancients, and how very sage philosophers were\r\nof opinion that the world is composed of music, that the heavens make\r\nharmony in their moving, and that the soul, being ordered in like\r\nfashion, awakes and as it were revives its powers through music.\r\n\r\n“Thus it is written that Alexander was sometimes excited by it so\r\npassionately, that he was forced almost against his will to leave the\r\nbanquet table and rush to arms; and when the musician changed the temper\r\nof the tune, he grew calm again, lay aside his arms, and returned to the\r\nbanquet table. Moreover I will tell you that grave Socrates learned to\r\nplay the cithern[122] at a very advanced age. And I remember having once\r\nheard that Plato and Aristotle would have the man of culture a musician\r\nalso; and they show by a host of arguments that the power of music over\r\nus is very great, and (for many reasons which would be too long to tell\r\nnow) that it must needs be taught from childhood, not so much for the\r\nmere melody that we hear, but for the power it has to induce in us a\r\nfresh and good habit of mind and an habitual tendency to virtue, which\r\nrenders the soul more capable of happiness, just as bodily exercise\r\nrenders the body more robust;[123] and that music is not only no\r\nhindrance in the pursuits of peace and war, but is very helpful therein.\r\n\r\n“Again, Lycurgus[124] approved of music in his harsh laws. And we read\r\nthat in their battles the very warlike Lacedemonians and Cretans used\r\nthe cithern and other dulcet instruments; that many very excellent\r\ncommanders of antiquity, like Epaminondas,[125] practised music; and\r\nthat those who were ignorant of it, like Themistocles,[126] were far\r\nless esteemed. Have you not read that music was among the first\r\naccomplishments which the worthy old Chiron taught Achilles in tender\r\nyouth,[127] whom he reared from the age of nurse and cradle? and that\r\nthe sage preceptor insisted that the hands which were to shed so much\r\nTrojan blood, should be often busied with the cithern? Where is the\r\nsoldier who would be ashamed to imitate Achilles,—to say nothing of many\r\nother famous commanders whom I could cite?\r\n\r\n“Therefore seek not to deprive our Courtier of music, which not only\r\nsoothes men’s minds, but often tames wild beasts;[128] and he who enjoys\r\nit not, may be sure that his spirit is ill attuned. See what power it\r\nhas, to make (as once it did) a fish submit to be ridden by a man upon\r\nthe boisterous sea.[129] We find it used in holy temples to render\r\npraise and thanks to God; and we must believe that it is pleasing to Him\r\nand that He has given it to us as most sweet alleviation for our\r\nfatigues and troubles. Wherefore rough toilers of the field under a\r\nburning sun often cheat their weariness with crude and rustic song. With\r\nmusic the rude peasant lass, who is up before the day to spin or weave,\r\nwards off her drowsiness and makes her toil a pleasure; music is very\r\ncheering pastime for poor sailors after rain, wind and tempest: a solace\r\nto tired pilgrims on their long and weary journeys, and often to\r\nsorrowing captives in their chains and fetters. Thus, as stronger proof\r\nthat melody even if rude is very great relief from every human toil and\r\ncare, nature seems to have taught it to the nurse as chief remedy for\r\nthe continual wailing of frail children, who by the sound of her voice\r\nare brought restful and placid sleep, forgetful of the tears so proper\r\nto them and given us in that age by nature as a presage of our after\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n48.—As the Count now remained silent for a little, the Magnifico\r\nGiuliano said:\r\n\r\n“I do not at all agree with my lord Gaspar. Nay I think, for the reasons\r\nyou give and for many others, that music is not only an ornament but a\r\nnecessity to the Courtier. Yet I would have you declare in what way this\r\nand the other accomplishments that you prescribe for him, are to be\r\npractised, and at what time and in what manner.[130] For many things\r\nthat are praiseworthy in themselves often become very inappropriate when\r\npractised out of season, and on the other hand, some that seem of little\r\nmoment are highly esteemed when made use of opportunely.”\r\n\r\n49.—Then the Count said:\r\n\r\n“Before we enter upon that subject, I wish to discuss another matter,\r\nwhich I deem of great importance and therefore think our Courtier ought\r\nby no means to omit: and this is to know how to draw and to have\r\nacquaintance with the very art of painting.\r\n\r\n“And do not marvel that I desire this art, which to-day may seem to\r\nsavour of the artisan and little to befit a gentleman; for I remember\r\nhaving read that the ancients, especially throughout Greece, had their\r\nboys of gentle birth study painting in school as an honourable and\r\nnecessary thing, and it was admitted to the first rank of liberal arts;\r\nwhile by public edict they forbade that it be taught to slaves. Among\r\nthe Romans too, it was held in highest honour, and the very noble family\r\nof the Fabii took their name from it; for the first Fabius was given the\r\nname _Pictor_, because,—being indeed a most excellent painter, and so\r\ndevoted to painting that when he painted the walls of the temple of\r\nHealth,—he inscribed his own name thereon;[131] for although he was born\r\nof a family thus renowned and honoured with so many consular titles,\r\ntriumphs and other dignities, and although he was a man of letters and\r\nlearned in the law, and numbered among the orators,—yet he thought to\r\nadd splendour and ornament to his fame by leaving a memorial that he had\r\nbeen a painter. Nor is there lack of many other men of illustrious\r\nfamily, celebrated in this art; which besides being very noble and\r\nworthy in itself, is of great utility, and especially in war for drawing\r\nplaces, sites, rivers, bridges, rocks, fortresses, and the like; since\r\nhowever well we may keep them in memory (which is very difficult), we\r\ncannot show them to others.\r\n\r\n“And truly he who does not esteem this art, seems to me very\r\nunreasonable; for this universal fabric that we see,—with the vast\r\nheaven so richly adorned with shining stars, and in the midst the earth\r\ngirdled by the seas, varied with mountains, valleys and rivers, and\r\nbedecked with so many divers trees, beautiful flowers and grasses,—may\r\nbe said to be a great and noble picture, composed by the hand of nature\r\nand of God; and whoever is able to imitate it, seems to me deserving of\r\ngreat praise: nor can it be imitated without knowledge of many things,\r\nas he knows well who tries. Hence the ancients greatly prized both the\r\nart and the artist, which thus attained the summit of highest\r\nexcellence; very sure proof of which may be found in the antique marble\r\nand bronze statues that yet are seen.[132] And although painting is\r\ndifferent from sculpture, both the one and the other spring from the\r\nsame source, which is good design. Therefore, as the statues are divine,\r\nso we may believe the pictures were also; the more indeed because they\r\nare susceptible of greater skill.”\r\n\r\n50.—Then my lady Emilia turned to Giancristoforo Romano, who was sitting\r\nwith the others there, and said:\r\n\r\n“What think you of this opinion? Do you admit that painting is\r\nsusceptible of greater skill than sculpture?”[133]\r\n\r\nGiancristoforo replied:\r\n\r\n“I, my Lady, think that sculpture needs more pains, more skill, and is\r\nof greater dignity than painting.”\r\n\r\nThe Count rejoined:\r\n\r\n“In that statues are more enduring, perhaps we might say they are of\r\ngreater dignity; for being made as memorials, they fulfil better than\r\npainting the purpose for which they are made. But besides serving as\r\nmemorials, both painting and sculpture serve also to beautify, and in\r\nthis respect painting is much superior; for if less diuturnal (so to\r\nspeak) than sculpture, yet it is of very long life, and is far more\r\ncharming so long as it endures.”\r\n\r\nThen Giancristoforo replied:\r\n\r\n“I really think that you are speaking against your convictions and that\r\nyou are doing so solely for the sake of your friend Raphael; and perhaps\r\ntoo the excellence you find in his painting seems to you so consummate\r\nthat sculpture cannot rival it: but consider that this is praise of an\r\nartist and not of his art.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI\r\n  1475-1564\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from a photograph, specially made by Soame, of an anonymous and\r\n    hitherto unpublished bronze head at Oxford. From a death-mask,\r\n    Michelangelo’s pupil Daniele Ricciarelli da Volterra (1500-1566)\r\n    prepared a mould, of which this and the similar “Piot” head in the\r\n    Louvre are believed to be unchased castings. See C. Drury E.\r\n    Fortnum’s article “On the Bronze Portrait Busts of Michelangelo,”\r\n    etc., in the Archæological Journal.\r\n\r\nThen he continued:\r\n\r\n“It seems clear to me that both the one and the other are artificial\r\nimitations of nature; but I do not see how you can say that truth, such\r\nas nature makes it, is not better imitated in a marble or bronze\r\nstatue,—wherein the members are round, formed and measured, as nature\r\nmakes them,—than in a painting, where we see nothing but the surface and\r\nthose colours that cheat the eyes; nor will you tell me, surely, that\r\nbeing is not nearer truth than seeming. Moreover I think sculpture is\r\nmore difficult, because if a slip is made, it cannot be corrected (since\r\nmarble cannot be patched again), but another statue must be made anew;\r\nwhich does not happen with painting, for one may change a thousand\r\ntimes, and add and take away, improving always.”\r\n\r\n51.—The Count said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“I am not speaking for Raphael’s sake; nor ought you to repute me so\r\nignorant as not to know the excellence of Michelangelo in sculpture,\r\nyour own, and others’. But I am speaking of the art, and not of the\r\nartists.\r\n\r\n“You say very truly that both the one and the other are imitations of\r\nnature; but it is not true that painting seems, and sculpture is. For\r\nwhile statues are round as in life and painting is seen only on the\r\nsurface, statues lack many things that paintings do not lack, and\r\nespecially light and shade. Thus flesh has one tone and marble another;\r\nand this the painter imitates to the life by chiaroscuro, greater or\r\nless according to the need,—which the sculptor cannot do. And although\r\nthe painter does not make his figure round, he presents the muscles and\r\nmembers rounded in such fashion as so to join the parts which are not\r\nseen, that we can discern very well that the painter knows and\r\nunderstands these also. And in this, another and greater skill is needed\r\nto represent those members that are foreshortened and grow smaller in\r\nproportion to the distance by reason of perspective; which, by means of\r\nmeasured lines, colours, lights and shades, shows you foreground and\r\ndistance all on the single surface of an upright wall, in such\r\nproportion as he chooses.[134] Do you really think it of small moment to\r\nimitate the natural colours, in representing flesh or stuffs or any\r\nother coloured thing? The sculptor certainly cannot do this, or express\r\nthe grace of black eyes or blue, with the splendour of their amourous\r\nbeams. He cannot show the colour of fair hair, or the gleam of weapons,\r\nor a dark night, or a storm at sea, or its lightnings and thunderbolts,\r\nor the burning of a city, or the birth of rosy dawn with its rays of\r\ngold and purple. In short, he cannot show sky, sea, earth, mountains,\r\nwoods, meadows, gardens, rivers, cities, or houses,—all of which the\r\npainter shows.\r\n\r\n52.—“Therefore painting seems to me nobler and more susceptible of\r\nskill, than sculpture. And I think that it, like other things, reached\r\nthe summit of excellence among the ancients: which still is seen in the\r\nfew slight remains that are left, especially in the grottoes of\r\nRome;[135] but much more clearly may it be perceived in the ancient\r\nauthors, wherein is such honoured and frequent mention both of works and\r\nof masters, and whereby we learn how highly they were always honoured by\r\ngreat lords and by commonwealths.\r\n\r\n“Thus we read that Alexander loved Apelles of Ephesus dearly,—so dearly,\r\nthat having caused the artist to paint a portrait of his favourite slave\r\nundraped, and hearing that the worthy painter had become most ardently\r\nenamoured of her by reason of her marvellous beauty, he gave her to\r\nApelles without hesitation:—munificence truly worthy of Alexander, to\r\nsacrifice not only treasure and states but his very affections and\r\ndesires; and sign of exceeding love for Apelles, in order to please the\r\nartist, not to hesitate at displeasing the woman he dearly loved, who\r\n(we may believe) was sorely grieved to change so great a king for a\r\npainter. Many other signs also are told of Alexander’s favour to\r\nApelles; but he very clearly showed how highly he esteemed the painter,\r\nin commanding by public edict that none other should presume to paint\r\nhis portrait.\r\n\r\n“Here I could tell you of the rivalries of many noble painters, which\r\nfilled nearly the whole world with praise and wonderment. I could tell\r\nyou with what solemnity ancient emperors adorned their triumphs with\r\npictures, and set them up in public places, and how dearly bought them;\r\nand that there were some painters who gave their works as gifts,\r\nesteeming gold and silver inadequate to pay for them; and how a painting\r\nby Protogenes was prized so highly, that when Demetrius[136] laid siege\r\nto Rhodes and could have gained an entrance by setting fire to the\r\nquarter where he knew the painting was, he refrained from giving battle\r\nso that it might not be burned, and thus did not capture the place; and\r\nthat Metrodorus,[137] a philosopher and very excellent painter, was sent\r\nby the Athenians to Lucius Paulus[138] to teach his children and to\r\nadorn the triumph that he was about to receive. Moreover many noble\r\nauthors have written about this art, which is a great sign of the esteem\r\nin which it was held; but I do not wish to enlarge further upon it in\r\nthis discussion.\r\n\r\n“So let it be enough to say that it is fitting for our Courtier to have\r\nknowledge of painting also, as being honourable and useful and highly\r\nprized in those times when men were of far greater worth than now they\r\nare. And if he should never derive from it other use or pleasure than\r\nthe help it affords in judging the merit of statues ancient and modern,\r\nof vases, buildings, medals, cameos, intaglios, and the like,—it also\r\nenables him to appreciate the beauty of living bodies, not only as to\r\ndelicacy of face but as to symmetry of all the other parts, both in men\r\nand in every other creature. Thus you see how a knowledge of painting is\r\na source of very great pleasure. And let those think of this, who so\r\ndelight in contemplating a woman’s beauty that they seem to be in\r\nparadise, and yet cannot paint; which if they could do, they would have\r\nmuch greater pleasure, because they would more perfectly appreciate that\r\nbeauty which engenders such satisfaction in their hearts.”\r\n\r\n53.—Here messer Cesare Gonzaga laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“Certainly I am no painter; yet I am sure I have greater pleasure in\r\nlooking upon a woman than that admirable Apelles, whom you just\r\nmentioned, would have if he were now come back to life.”\r\n\r\nThe Count replied:\r\n\r\n“This pleasure of yours is not derived wholly from her beauty, but from\r\nthe affection that perhaps you bear her; and if you will say the truth,\r\nthe first time you saw that woman you did not feel a thousandth part of\r\nthe pleasure that you did afterwards, although her beauty was the same.\r\nThus you may see how much more affection had to do with your pleasure,\r\nthan beauty had.”\r\n\r\n“I do not deny this,” said messer Cesare; “but just as my pleasure is\r\nborn of affection, so is affection born of beauty. Thus it may still be\r\nsaid that beauty is the cause of my pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe Count replied:\r\n\r\n“Many other causes also inflame our minds, besides beauty: such as\r\nmanners, knowledge, speech, gesture, and a thousand other things which\r\nin a way perhaps might also be called beauties; but above all, the\r\nconsciousness of being loved. So it is possible to love very ardently\r\neven without that beauty you speak of; but the love that springs from\r\nthe outward bodily beauty which we see, will doubtless give far greater\r\npleasure to him who appreciates it more than to him who appreciates it\r\nless. Therefore, to return to our subject, I think that Apelles enjoyed\r\nthe contemplation of Campaspe’s beauty far more than Alexander did:[139]\r\nfor we may easily believe that both men’s love sprang only from her\r\nbeauty; and perhaps it was partly on this account that Alexander\r\nresolved to give her to him who seemed fitted to appreciate her most\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\n“Have you not read that those five maidens of Crotona, whom the painter\r\nZeuxis chose above the others of that city for the purpose of forming\r\nfrom them all a single type of surpassing beauty, were celebrated by\r\nmany poets as having been adjudged beautiful by one who must have been a\r\nconsummate judge of beauty?”[140]\r\n\r\n54.—Messer Cesare here seemed ill satisfied and unwilling to admit for a\r\nmoment that anyone but himself could taste that pleasure which he felt\r\nin contemplating a woman’s beauty, and he began to speak. But just then\r\na great tramping of feet was heard, and the sound of loud talking;\r\nwhereupon everyone turned, and a glare of torches was seen at the door\r\nof the room, and soon there arrived, with a numerous and noble company,\r\nmy lord Prefect,[3] who returned from attending the pope part way on the\r\njourney. At once on entering the palace he had asked what my lady\r\nDuchess was doing, and had learned of what manner the game was that\r\nevening, and the charge imposed on Count Ludovico to speak about\r\nCourtiership. Therefore he came as fast as he could, so as to arrive in\r\nseason to hear something. Then, immediately after having made his\r\nreverence to my lady Duchess and bidden the others to be seated (for\r\neveryone had risen when he came in),—he too sat down in the circle with\r\nsome of his gentlemen; among whom were the Marquess Febus di Ceva and\r\nhis brother Gerardino,[141] messer Ettore Romano,[142] Vincenzo\r\nCalmeta,[143] Orazio Florido,[144] and many others; and as everyone\r\nremained silent, my lord Prefect said:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, my coming here would be indeed a pity, if I were to\r\ninterrupt such a fine discussion as I think you were just now engaged\r\nin; so do me not this wrong of depriving yourselves and me of such a\r\npleasure.”\r\n\r\nThen Count Ludovico said:\r\n\r\n“Nay, my Lord, I think we all must be far better pleased to be silent\r\nthan to speak; for this burden having fallen more to me than to the\r\nothers this evening, I have at last grown weary of speaking, and I think\r\nall the others are weary of listening, for my talk has not been worthy\r\nof this company or adequate to the lofty theme that I was charged with;\r\nin which, having little satisfied myself, I think I have satisfied the\r\nothers still less. So you were fortunate, my Lord, to come in at the\r\nend. And for the rest of the discussion, it would indeed be well to\r\nappoint someone else to take my place, because whoever he may be, I know\r\nhe will fill it far better than I should even if I were willing to go\r\non, being now tired as I am.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n55.—“I certainly shall not submit to be cheated of the promise that you\r\nmade me, and am sure my lord Prefect too will not be sorry to hear that\r\npart of our discussion.”\r\n\r\n“And what promise was it?” said the Count.\r\n\r\n“To tell us in what way the Courtier must make use of those good\r\nqualities that you have said befit him,” replied the Magnifico.\r\n\r\nAlthough but a boy, my lord Prefect was wise and sensible beyond what\r\nseemed natural to his tender years, and in his every movement he showed\r\na loftiness of mind and a certain vivacity of temper that gave true\r\npresage of the high pitch of manliness that he was to attain. So he said\r\nquickly:\r\n\r\n“If all this is to be told, I think I have come just in time; for by\r\nhearing in what way the Courtier must use his good qualities, I shall\r\nhear also what they are, and thus shall come to learn everything that\r\nhas been said before. So do not refuse, Count, to fulfil the obligation\r\nof which you have already performed a part.”\r\n\r\n“I should not have so heavy an obligation to fulfil,” replied the Count,\r\n“if the labour were more evenly divided; but the mistake was made of\r\ngiving the right of command to a too partial lady;” and then laughing he\r\nturned to my lady Emilia, who quickly said:\r\n\r\n“It is not you who ought to complain of my partiality; but since you do\r\nso without reason, we will give someone else a share of this honour,\r\nwhich you call labour;” and turning to messer Federico Fregoso, she\r\nsaid: “You proposed the game of the Courtier, hence it is right that you\r\nshould bear some share in it; and this shall be to comply with my lord\r\nMagnifico’s request, by declaring in what way, manner and time, the\r\nCourtier ought to make use of his good qualities and practise those\r\nthings which the Count has said it is fitting he should know.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, in trying to separate the way and the time and the manner of\r\nthe Courtier’s good qualities and good practice, you try to separate\r\nthat which cannot be separated, because these are the very things that\r\nmake his qualities good, and his practice good. Therefore, since the\r\nCount has spoken so much and so well, and has touched somewhat upon\r\nthese matters and arranged in his mind the rest of what he has to say,\r\nit was only right that he should continue to the end.”\r\n\r\n“Account yourself to be the Count,” said my lady Emilia, “and say what\r\nyou think he would say; and thus all will be right.”\r\n\r\n56.—Then Calmeta said:\r\n\r\n“My Lords, since the hour is late, and in order that messer Federico may\r\nhave no excuse for not telling what he knows, I think it would be well\r\nto postpone the rest of the discussion until to-morrow, and let the\r\nlittle time we have left, be spent in some other quiet diversion.”\r\n\r\nAs everyone approved, my lady Duchess desired madonna Margarita[145] and\r\nmadonna Costanza Fregosa[57] to dance. Whereupon Barletta,[146] a very\r\ncharming musician and excellent dancer, who always kept the whole court\r\nin good humour, began to play upon his instruments; and joining hands,\r\nthe two ladies danced first a basset and then a _roegarze_,[147] with\r\nconsummate grace and to the great delight of those who saw them. Then\r\nthe night being already far spent, my lady Duchess rose to her feet, and\r\nso everyone reverently took leave and retired to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE SECOND BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n                     BY COUNT BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n                       TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO\r\n\r\n1.—I have often considered not without wonder whence arises a fault,\r\nwhich, as it is universally found among old people, may be believed to\r\nbe proper and natural to them. And this is, that they nearly all praise\r\nbygone times and censure the present, inveighing against our acts and\r\nways and everything which they in their youth did not do; affirming too\r\nthat every good custom and good manner of living, every virtue, in short\r\nevery thing, is always going from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nAnd verily it seems quite contrary to reason and worthy to be wondered\r\nat, that ripe age, which in other matters is wont to make men’s judgment\r\nmore perfect with long experience, should in this matter so corrupt it\r\nthat they do not perceive that if the world were always growing worse,\r\nand if fathers were generally better than children, we should long since\r\nhave reached that last grade of badness beyond which it is impossible to\r\ngrow worse. And yet we see that not only in our days but in bygone times\r\nthis failing has always been peculiar to old age, which is clearly\r\ngathered from the works of many ancient authors, and especially of the\r\ncomic writers, who better than the others set forth the image of human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nNow the cause of this wrong judgment among old people I for my part take\r\nto be, that the fleeting years despoil them of many good things, and\r\namong others in great part rob the blood of vital spirits; whence the\r\ncomplexion changes, and those organs become weak through which the soul\r\nexerts its powers.[148] Thus in old age the sweet flowers of contentment\r\nfall from our hearts, like leaves from a tree in autumn, and in place of\r\nserene and sunny thoughts, comes cloudy and turbid sadness with its\r\ntrain of thousand ills. So that not the body only but the mind also is\r\ninfirm; of bygone pleasures naught is left but a lingering memory and\r\nthe image of that precious time of tender youth, in which (when it is\r\nwith us) sky and earth and all things seem to us ever making merry and\r\nlaughing before our eyes, and the sweet springtide of happiness seems to\r\nblossom in our thought, as in a delightful and lovely garden.\r\n\r\nTherefore in the evening chill of life, when our sun begins to sink to\r\nits setting and steals away those pleasures, we should fare better if in\r\nlosing them, we could lose the memory of them also, and as Themistocles\r\nsaid, find an art that shall teach us to forget. For so deceitful are\r\nour bodily senses, that they often cheat even the judgment of our minds.\r\nThus it seems to me that old people are in like case with those who keep\r\ntheir eyes fixed upon the land as they leave port, and think their ship\r\nis standing still and the shore recedes, although it is the other way.\r\nFor both the port and also time and its pleasures remain the same, and\r\none after another we take flight in the ship of mortality upon that\r\nboisterous sea which absorbs and devours everything, and are never\r\nsuffered to touch shore again, but always tossed by adverse winds we are\r\nwrecked upon some rock at last.\r\n\r\nSince therefore the senile mind is an unfit subject for many pleasures,\r\nit cannot enjoy them; and just as to men in fever, when the palate is\r\nspoiled by corrupt vapours, all wines seem bitter, however precious and\r\ndelicate they be,—so old men, because of their infirmity (which yet does\r\nnot deprive them of appetite), find pleasures flat and cold and very\r\ndifferent from those which they remember tasting of old, although the\r\npleasures are intrinsically the same. Thus they feel themselves\r\ndespoiled, and they lament and call the present times bad, not\r\nperceiving that the change lies in themselves and not in the times; and\r\non the other hand they call to mind their bygone pleasures, and bring\r\nback the time when these were enjoyed and praise it as good, because it\r\nseems to carry with it a savour of what they felt when it was present.\r\nFor in truth our minds hold all things hateful that have been with us in\r\nour sorrows, and love those that have been with us in our joys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BORSO D’ESTE\r\n  DUKE OF FERRARA\r\n  1413-1471\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from Anderson’s photograph (no. 11375) of a part of the injured\r\n    fresco, “Triumph of Minerva,” in the Palazzo Schifanoia at Ferrara,\r\n    painted about 1468 by Francesco Cossa (1438?-1480?). See Gustave\r\n    Gruyer’s _L’Art Ferrarais_, ii, 581.\r\n\r\nThis is why it is sometimes highest bliss for a lover to look at a\r\nwindow although closed, because he there had once the happiness to gaze\r\nupon the lady of his love; and in the same way to look at a ring, a\r\nletter, a garden or other place, or what you will, which seems to him a\r\nconscious witness of his joys. And on the contrary, a gorgeous and\r\nbeautiful room will often be irksome to a man who has been prisoner or\r\nhas suffered some other sorrow there. And I once knew some who would not\r\ndrink from a cup like that from which in illness they had taken\r\nmedicine. For just as to the one the window or ring or letter recalls\r\nthe sweet memory that gives him such delight and seems part of his\r\nbygone joy,—so to the other, the room or cup brings his illness or\r\nimprisonment to mind. I believe that the same cause leads old people to\r\npraise bygone times and to censure the present.\r\n\r\n2.—Therefore as they speak of other things, so do they also of courts,\r\naffirming those which they remember, to have been far more excellent and\r\nfull of eminent men than those which we see to-day. And as soon as such\r\ndiscussions are started, they begin to extol with boundless praise the\r\ncourtiers of Duke Filippo or Duke Borso;[149] and they narrate the\r\nsayings of Niccolò Piccinino;[150] and they remind us that there were no\r\nmurders in those days (or very few at most), no brawls, no ambushes, no\r\ndeceits, but a certain frank and kindly good will among all men, a loyal\r\nconfidence; and that in the courts of that time such good behaviour and\r\ndecorum prevailed, that courtiers were all like monks, and woe to him\r\nwho should have spoken insultingly to another, or so much as made a less\r\nthan decorous gesture to a woman. And on the other hand they say\r\neverything is the reverse in these days, and that not only have\r\ncourtiers lost their fraternal love and gentle mode of life, but that\r\nnothing prevails in courts but envy, malice, immorality and very\r\ndissolute living, with every sort of vice,—the women lascivious without\r\nshame, the men effeminate. They condemn our dress also as indecorous and\r\ntoo womanish.\r\n\r\nIn short they censure an infinity of things, among which many indeed\r\nmerit censure, for it cannot be denied that there are many bad and\r\nwicked men among us, or that this age of ours is much fuller of vice\r\nthan that which they praise.[151] Yet it seems to me that they ill\r\ndiscern the cause of this difference, and that they are foolish. For\r\nthey would have the world contain all good and no evil, which is\r\nimpossible; because, since evil is opposed to good and good to evil, it\r\nis almost necessary, by force of opposition and counterpoise as it were,\r\nthat the one should sustain and fortify the other, and that if either\r\nwanes or waxes, so must the other also, since there is no contrary\r\nwithout its contrary.\r\n\r\nWho does not know that there would be no justice in the world, if there\r\nwere no wrongs? No courage, if there were no cowards? No continence, if\r\nthere were no incontinence? No health, if there were no infirmity? No\r\ntruth, if there were no lying? No good fortune, if there were no\r\nmisfortunes? Thus, according to Plato,[152] Socrates well says it is\r\nsurprising that Æsop did not write a fable showing that as God had never\r\nbeen able to join pleasure and pain together, He joined them by their\r\nextremities, so that the beginning of the one should be the end of the\r\nother; for we see that no joy can give us pleasure, unless sorrow\r\nprecedes it. Who can hold rest dear, unless he has first felt the\r\nhardship of fatigue? Who enjoys food, drink and sleep, unless he has\r\nfirst endured hunger, thirst and wakefulness? Hence I believe that\r\nsufferings and diseases were given man by nature not chiefly to make him\r\nsubject to them (since it does not seem fitting that she who is mother\r\nof every good should give us such evils of her own determined purpose),\r\nbut as nature created health, joy and other blessings,—diseases, sorrows\r\nand other ills followed after them as a consequence. In like manner, the\r\nvirtues having been bestowed upon the world by grace and gift of nature,\r\nat once by force of that same bounden opposition, the vices became their\r\nfellows by necessity; so that always as the one waxes or wanes, thus\r\nlikewise must needs the other wax or wane.\r\n\r\n3.—So when our old men praise bygone courts for not containing such\r\nvicious men as some that our courts contain, they do not perceive that\r\ntheir courts did not contain such virtuous men as some that ours\r\ncontain; which is no marvel, for no evil is so bad as that which springs\r\nfrom the corrupted seed of good, and hence, as nature now puts forth far\r\nbetter wits than she did then, those who devote themselves to good, do\r\nfar better than was formerly done, and likewise those who devote\r\nthemselves to evil, do far worse. Therefore we must not on that account\r\nsay that those who refrained from evil because they did not know how to\r\ndo evil, deserved any praise for it; for although they did little harm,\r\nthey did the worst they could. And that the wits of those times were\r\ngenerally inferior to those of our time, can be well enough perceived in\r\nall that we see of those times, both in letters and in pictures,\r\nstatues, buildings, and every other thing.\r\n\r\nThese old men censure us also for many a thing that in itself is neither\r\ngood nor evil, simply because they did not do it. And they say it is not\r\nseemly for young men to ride through the city on horse, still less in\r\npumps, to wear fur linings or long skirts in winter, or to wear a cap\r\nbefore reaching at least the age of eighteen years, and the like;\r\nwherein they certainly are wrong, for besides being convenient and\r\nuseful, these customs have been introduced by usage and meet universal\r\nfavour, just as formerly it was to go about in gala dress with open\r\nbreeches and polished pumps, and for greater elegance to carry a\r\nsparrow-hawk on the wrist all day without reason, to dance without\r\ntouching the lady’s hand, and to follow many other fashions that now\r\nwould be as very clumsy as they then were highly prized.\r\n\r\nTherefore let it be allowed us also to follow the custom of our time\r\nwithout being slandered by these old men, who in their wish to praise\r\nthemselves, often say: “When I was twenty years old, I still slept with\r\nmy mother and sisters, nor did I for a long time afterwards know what\r\nwomen are; while now, boys hardly have hair on their heads before they\r\nknow more tricks than grown men did in our time.” Nor do they perceive\r\nthat in saying this they acknowledge that our boys have more mind than\r\ntheir old men had.\r\n\r\nLet them cease then to censure our time as full of vices, for in\r\nremoving the vices they would remove the virtues too; and let them\r\nremember that among the worthies of old, in the ages when there lived\r\nthose spirits who were glorious and truly divine in every virtue, and\r\nthose more than human minds,—there were also to be found many very bad\r\nmen; who (if they were living) would be as eminently bad among our bad\r\nmen, as the good men of that time would be eminently good. And of this,\r\nall history gives ample proof.\r\n\r\n4.—But I think these old men have now sufficient answer. So we will end\r\nthis homily, perhaps already too diffuse but not wholly irrelevant to\r\nour subject; and as it is enough for us to have shown that the courts of\r\nour time were worthy of no less praise than those which old men praise\r\nso highly,—we will pursue the discussion about the Courtier, from which\r\nwe may easily understand what rank the court of Urbino held among other\r\ncourts, and of what quality were the Prince and Lady to whom such noble\r\nspirits did service, and how fortunate they might hold themselves who\r\nlived in such companionship.\r\n\r\n5.—Now the following day having arrived, there were many and diverse\r\ndiscussions among the cavaliers and ladies of the court concerning the\r\ndebate of the evening before; which in great part arose because my lord\r\nPrefect, eager to know what had been said, questioned nearly everyone\r\nabout it, and (as is always wont to be the case) he received different\r\nanswers; for some praised one thing and some another, and among many too\r\nthere was disagreement as to the Count’s real opinion, since everyone’s\r\nmemory did not quite fully retain the things that were said.\r\n\r\nThus the matter was discussed nearly all day; and as soon as night set\r\nin, my lord Prefect desired that food be served and took all the\r\ngentlemen away to supper. When they had done eating, he repaired to the\r\nroom of my lady Duchess, who, on seeing such a numerous company and\r\nearlier than the custom was, said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks, messer Federico, it is a heavy burden that is placed upon\r\nyour shoulders, and great the expectation you must satisfy.”\r\n\r\nThen without waiting for messer Federico to reply, the Unico Aretino\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“And what, forsooth, is this great burden? Who is so foolish that when\r\nhe knows how to do a thing, does not do it in proper season?”\r\n\r\nSo, discoursing of this, everyone sat down in the usual place and order,\r\nwith eager expectation for the debate appointed.\r\n\r\n6.—Then messer Federico turned to the Unico, and said:\r\n\r\n“So, my lord Unico, you do not think that a laborious part and a great\r\nburden are imposed on me this evening, having to show in what way,\r\nmanner and time the Courtier ought to employ his good accomplishments\r\nand practise those things that have been said to befit him?”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me no great matter,” replied the Unico; “and I think it is\r\nquite enough to say that the Courtier should have good judgment, as the\r\nCount last evening rightly said he must; and this being so, I think that\r\nwithout other precepts he ought to be able to use what he knows\r\nseasonably and in a well bred way. To try to reduce this to more exact\r\nrules would be too difficult and perhaps superfluous. For I know no man\r\nso stupid as to wish to fence when others are intent on dancing; or to\r\ngo through the street dancing a morris-dance, however admirably he might\r\nknow how; or in trying to comfort a mother whose child has died, to\r\nbegin with pleasantries and witticism. Surely methinks no gentleman\r\nwould do this, who was not altogether a fool.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“It seems to me, my lord Unico, that you run too much to extremes. For\r\none may sometimes be silly in a way that is not so easily seen, and\r\nfaults are not always of the same degree: and it may be that a man will\r\nrefrain from public and too patent folly,—such as that would be of which\r\nyou tell, to dance a morris-dance about the piazza,—and yet cannot\r\nrefrain from praising himself out of season, from displaying a tiresome\r\nconceit, from occasionally saying something to cause laughter, which\r\nfalls cold and wholly flat from being said inopportunely. And these\r\nfaults are often covered by a kind of veil that does not suffer them to\r\nbe seen by him who commits them, unless he searches for them with care;\r\nand although our eyes see little for many reasons, they most of all are\r\nclouded by conceit, since everyone likes to make a show in that wherein\r\nhe believes himself proficient, whether his belief be true or false.\r\n\r\n“Therefore it seems to me that the right course in this regard lies in a\r\ncertain prudent and judicious choice, and in discerning the more or less\r\nwhich all things gain or lose by being done opportunely or out of\r\nseason. And although the Courtier may possess good enough judgment to\r\nperceive these distinctions, yet I think it would surely be easier for\r\nhim to attain what he is seeking, if we were to broaden his mind by a\r\nfew precepts, and show him the way and as it were the foundations upon\r\nwhich he must build,—than if he were to follow generalities only.\r\n\r\n7.—“Last evening the Count spoke about Courtiership so fully and so\r\nbeautifully, that he has aroused in me no little fear and doubt whether\r\nI shall be able to satisfy this noble company so well in what I have to\r\nsay, as he did in what it fell to him to say. Yet to make myself a\r\nsharer in his fame as far as I can, and to be sure of avoiding this one\r\nmistake at least, I shall contradict him in nothing.\r\n\r\n“Accepting his opinions then, and among others his opinion as to the\r\nCourtier’s noble birth, capacities, bodily form and grace of feature,—I\r\nsay that to win praise justly and good opinion from everyone and favour\r\nfrom the princes whom he serves, I deem it necessary for the Courtier to\r\nknow how to dispose his whole life, and to make the most of his good\r\nqualities in intercourse with all men everywhere, without exciting envy\r\nthereby. And how difficult this in itself is, we may infer from the\r\nfewness of those who are seen to reach the goal; for by nature we all\r\nare more ready to censure mistakes than to praise things well done, and\r\nmany men, from a kind of innate malignity and although they clearly see\r\nthe good, seem to strive with every effort and pains to find either some\r\nhidden fault in us or at least some semblance of fault.\r\n\r\n“Thus it is needful for our Courtier to be cautious in his every action,\r\nand always to mingle good sense with what he says or does. And let him\r\nnot only take care that his separate parts and qualities are excellent,\r\nbut let him order the tenour of his life in such fashion, that the whole\r\nmay be in keeping with these parts and be seen to be always and in\r\neverything accordant with his own self and form one single body of all\r\nthese good qualities; so that his every act may be the result and\r\ncompound of all his faculties, as the Stoics say is the duty of him who\r\nis wise.\r\n\r\n“Still, although in every action one faculty is always chief, yet all\r\nare so enlinked together, that they make for one end and may all further\r\nand serve every purpose. Hence he must know how to make the most of\r\nthem, and by means of contrast and as it were foil to the one, he must\r\nmake the other more clearly seen;—like good painters, who display and\r\nshow forth the lights of projecting objects by the use of shadow, and\r\nlikewise deepen the shadows of flat objects by means of light, and so\r\nassemble their divers colours that both the one and the other are better\r\ndisplayed by reason of that diversity, and the placing of figures in\r\nopposition one to another aids them to perform that office which is the\r\npainter’s aim.\r\n\r\n“Thus gentleness is very admirable in a man of noble birth who is\r\nvaliant and strong. And as his boldness seems greater when accompanied\r\nby modesty, so his modesty is enhanced and set off by his boldness.[153]\r\nHence to speak little, to do much, and not to boast of praiseworthy\r\ndeeds but to conceal them tactfully,—enhances both these attributes in\r\nthe case of one who knows how to employ this method with discretion; and\r\nso it is with all other good qualities.\r\n\r\n“Therefore in what our Courtier does or says I would have him follow a\r\nfew universal rules, which I think comprise briefly all that I have to\r\nsay. And for the first and most important let him above all avoid\r\naffectation, as the Count rightly advised last evening. Next let him\r\nconsider well what thing it is that he is doing or saying, the place\r\nwhere he is doing it, in whose presence, the cause that impels him, his\r\nage, his profession, the object he has in view, and the means that may\r\nconduce thereto; and so, with these precautions let him apply himself\r\ndiscreetly to whatever he has a mind to do or say.”\r\n\r\n8.—After messer Federico had spoken thus, he seemed to pause a little.\r\nWhereupon my lord Morello da Ortona at once said:\r\n\r\n“These rules of yours teach little, it seems to me; and for my part I\r\nknow as much about it now, as I did before you propounded them. Still I\r\nremember having heard them several times before also from the friars to\r\nwhom I made confession, and who called them ‘the circumstances,’ I\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico laughed and said:\r\n\r\n“If you remember rightly, the Count declared last evening that the\r\nCourtier’s chief business should be that of arms, and spoke at length\r\nabout the way in which he ought to practise it; therefore we will not\r\nrepeat this. Yet among our rules we may also lay it down that when our\r\nCourtier finds himself in a skirmish or action or battle, or in other\r\nsuch affairs, he ought to arrange discreetly to withdraw from the crowd,\r\nand to perform those glorious and brave deeds that he has to do, with as\r\nlittle company as he can, and in sight of all the noblest and most\r\nrespected men in the army, and especially in the presence and (if it is\r\npossible) before the very eyes of his king or of the prince whom he\r\nserves; for in truth it is very proper to make the most of one’s good\r\ndeeds. And I think that just as it is wrong to seek false and unmerited\r\nrenown, so it is wrong also to defraud oneself of the honour that is\r\none’s due, and not to seek that praise which alone is the true reward of\r\nworthy effort.\r\n\r\n“And I remember having in my time known some men who were very stupid in\r\nthis regard, although valiant, and who put their lives as much in danger\r\nto capture a flock of sheep, as to be the first to scale the walls of a\r\nbeleaguered town; which our Courtier will not do if he bears in mind the\r\nmotive that leads him into war, which should be honour only. And again\r\nif he happens to be playing at arms in public shows,—such as jousts,\r\ntourneys, stick-throwing, or any other bodily exercise,—mindful of the\r\nplace and presence in which he is, he will contrive to be not less\r\nelegant and graceful than unerring with his weapons, and to feast the\r\nspectators’ eyes with all those things which he thinks may give him an\r\nadded grace. He will take care that his horse is bravely caparisoned,\r\nthat his attire becomes him, that his mottoes are appropriate and his\r\ndevices clever, so that they may attract the eyes of the bystanders as\r\nthe loadstone attracts iron. He will never be among the last to show\r\nthemselves, knowing that the crowd and especially women gaze much more\r\nattentively upon the first than upon the last; for their eyes and minds,\r\nwhich at the start are eager for novelty and observe and are impressed\r\nby every trifle, are afterwards not only sated by repetition but even\r\ngrow weary. Thus there was an excellent actor of ancient times, who for\r\nthis reason always wished to be the first to perform his part in the\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n“So too, even in speaking of arms, our Courtier will have regard to the\r\nprofession of those with whom he converses, and will govern himself\r\naccordingly,—speaking in one way with men and in another way with women.\r\nAnd if he wishes to touch on something that is to his credit, he will do\r\nso covertly, as if by chance in passing, and with the discreetness and\r\ncaution that Count Ludovico expounded to us yesterday.\r\n\r\n9.—“Does it not seem to you now, my lord Morello, that our rules may\r\nteach something? Does it not seem to you that our friend, of whom I was\r\ntelling you a few days since, quite forgot with whom and why he was\r\nspeaking, when to entertain a lady he had never seen before, he began\r\nhis talk by telling her that he had slain so many men, and that he was a\r\nterrible fellow and knew how to handle a sword with both hands? Nor did\r\nhe leave her until he had tried to explain to her how certain blows of\r\nthe battle-axe ought to be parried when one is armed and how when\r\nunarmed, and to show the different ways of grasping the handle; so that\r\nthe poor soul was on the rack, and thought the hour seemed a thousand\r\nyears before she could send him off, almost fearing that he would slay\r\nher like the others. Such are the mistakes committed by those who pay no\r\nregard to the ‘circumstances,’ of which you say you heard from the\r\nfriars.\r\n\r\n“Next I say that of bodily exercises there are some that are almost\r\nnever practised except in public,—such as jousts, tourneys,\r\nstick-throwing, and all the rest that have to do with arms. Hence when\r\nour Courtier has to take part in these, he must first contrive to be so\r\nwell equipped in point of horses, weapons and dress, that he lacks\r\nnothing. And if he does not feel himself well provided with everything,\r\nlet him on no account engage, for if he fails to do well, the excuse\r\ncannot be made that these things are not his business. Then he must\r\ncarefully consider in whose presence he is seen and of what sort the\r\ncompany is, for it would not be seemly for a gentleman to honour a\r\nrustic festival with his presence, where the spectators and the company\r\nare of low degree.”\r\n\r\n10.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“In our Lombard country we do not make these distinctions. On the\r\ncontrary, there are many young gentlemen who dance all day with peasants\r\nin the sun on holidays, and play with them at throwing the bar,\r\nwrestling, running and leaping. And I do not think it amiss, for there\r\nthe rivalry is not of birth, but of strength and agility, wherein\r\nvillagers are often quite a match for nobles; and this condescension\r\nseems to have in it a pleasant touch of generosity.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“This dancing of yours in the sun pleases me not in any way, nor do I\r\nsee what gain there is in it. But in my opinion whoever cares to wrestle\r\nor run or leap with peasants, ought to do so as a matter of practice and\r\nout of courtesy as we say, not in rivalry with them. And a man ought to\r\nbe almost sure of winning; else let him not engage, because it is too\r\nunseemly and shameful a thing, and beneath his dignity, to see a\r\ngentleman vanquished by a peasant, and especially at wrestling. Hence I\r\nthink it is well to abstain, at least in the presence of many, for the\r\ngain of beating is very small and the loss of being beaten is very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n“The game of tennis also is nearly always played in public, and is one\r\nof those sports to which a crowd lends much distinction. Therefore I\r\nwould have our Courtier practise this, and all the others except the\r\nhandling of arms, as something that is not his profession, and let him\r\nshow that he does not seek or expect praise for it, nor let him seem to\r\ndevote much care or time to it, although he may do it admirably. Nor let\r\nhim be like some men who delight in music, and in speaking with anyone\r\nalways begin to sing under their breath whenever there is a pause in the\r\nconversation. Others always go dancing as they pass through streets and\r\nchurches. Others, when they meet a friend in the piazza or anywhere\r\nelse, at once put themselves in posture as if for fencing or wrestling,\r\naccording to their favourite humour.”\r\n\r\nHere messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“A young cardinal we have in Rome does better than that; for out of\r\npride in his fine bodily frame, he conducts into his garden all who come\r\nto visit him (even although he has never seen them before), and urgently\r\npresses them to strip to the doublet and try a turn with him at\r\nleaping.”\r\n\r\n11.—Messer Federico laughed; then he went on:\r\n\r\n“There are certain other exercises that can be practised in public and\r\nin private, like dancing; and in this I think the Courtier ought to have\r\na care, for when dancing in the presence of many and in a place full of\r\npeople, it seems to me that he should preserve a certain dignity, albeit\r\ntempered with a lithe and airy grace of movement; and although he may\r\nfeel himself to be very nimble and a master of time and measure, let him\r\nnot attempt those agilities of foot and double steps which we find very\r\nbecoming in our friend Barletta, but which perhaps would be little\r\nsuited to a gentleman. Yet in a room privately, as we are now, I think\r\nhe may try both, and may dance morris-dances and brawls;[154] but not in\r\npublic unless he be masked, when it is not displeasing even though he be\r\nrecognized by all.\r\n\r\n“Indeed there is no better way of displaying oneself in such matters at\r\npublic sports, either armed or unarmed; because disguise carries with it\r\na certain freedom and licence, which among other things enable a man to\r\nchoose a part for which he feels himself qualified, and to use care and\r\nelaboration upon the chief point of the thing wherein he would display\r\nhimself, and a certain nonchalance as to that which does not\r\ncount,—which greatly enhances the charm: as for a youth to array himself\r\nlike an old man, yet in easy dress so as to be able to show his vigour;\r\na cavalier in the guise of a rustic shepherd or some other like costume,\r\nbut with a perfect horse and gracefully bedecked in character;—because\r\nthe mind of the spectators is quick to fill out the image of that which\r\nis presented to the eyes at first glance; and then seeing the thing turn\r\nout much better than the costume promised, they are amused and\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n“But in these sports and shows where masks are worn, it would not be\r\nseemly for a prince to try to enact the part of a prince, because that\r\npleasure which the spectators find in novelty would be in great measure\r\nlacking, since it is news to no one that the prince is the prince; and\r\nhe, conscious that besides being the prince he is trying to play the\r\nprince, loses the freedom to do all those things that are beneath a\r\nprince’s dignity. And if there were any contest in these sports,\r\nespecially with arms, he might even make men think that he chose to\r\nimpersonate a prince in order not to be beaten but spared by others;\r\nmoreover were he to do in sport the same that it behooves him to do in\r\nearnest upon occasion, he would deprive his own proper action of\r\ndignity, and make it almost seem as if that too were sport. But at such\r\ntimes, if the prince lays aside his character of prince, and mingles\r\nequally with his inferiors yet in such fashion as to be recognizable, by\r\nrenouncing his own rank he attains a higher one, in that he prefers to\r\nexcel the rest not by authority but by merit, and to show that his worth\r\nis not enhanced by the fact that he is a prince.\r\n\r\n12.—“I say then that in these martial sports the Courtier ought to use\r\nthe like discretion, according to his rank. In horseback vaulting too,\r\nin wrestling, running and leaping, I should be well pleased to have him\r\nshun the vulgar crowd, or at most let himself be very rarely seen; for\r\nthere is not on earth a thing so excellent but the ignorant will tire of\r\nit and hold it of small account, if they see it often.\r\n\r\n“As to music I hold the same opinion: hence I would not have our\r\nCourtier behave like many, who are no sooner come anywhere (even into\r\nthe presence of gentlemen with whom they have no acquaintance), than\r\nwithout waiting to be urged they set about doing what they know and\r\noften what they do not know; so that it seems as if they had come only\r\nfor the purpose of showing themselves, and had that for their chief\r\nprofession. Therefore let the Courtier resort to music as a pastime and\r\nalmost unwillingly, and not before vulgar people nor very many. And\r\nalthough he may know and understand that which he is doing, in this too\r\nI would have him hide the study and pains that are necessary in\r\neverything one would do well, and seem to value this accomplishment\r\nlightly in himself, but by practising it admirably make others value it\r\nhighly.”\r\n\r\n13.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“There are many kinds of music, vocal as well as instrumental: therefore\r\nI should like to hear which is the best of all, and at what time the\r\nCourtier ought to perform it.”[155]\r\n\r\nMesser Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“I regard as beautiful music, to sing well by note, with ease and in\r\nbeautiful style; but as even far more beautiful, to sing to the\r\naccompaniment of the viol,[156] because nearly all the sweetness lies in\r\nthe solo part, and we note and observe the fine manner and the melody\r\nwith much greater attention when our ears are not occupied with more\r\nthan a single voice, and moreover every little fault is more clearly\r\ndiscerned,—which is not the case when several sing together, because\r\neach singer helps his neighbour. But above all, singing to the viol by\r\nway of recitative seems to me most delightful, which adds to the words a\r\ncharm and grace that are very admirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                      ELISABET DE GONZAGA FELTRIA\r\n                           “My Lady Duchess”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 EMILIA\r\n                            “My Lady Emilia”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MARGARITA DE GONZAGA\r\n                          “Madonna Margarita”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FRANC^O M^A\r\n                           “My Lord Prefect”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JULIANO DE MEDICI\r\n                          “My Lord Magnifico”\r\n\r\n                 AUTOGRAPH SIGNATURES OF INTERLOCUTORS\r\n\r\nFrom negatives, made by Premi and by Signor Lanzoni, from originals\r\n    preserved in the Royal State Archives at Mantua and selected by the\r\n    Director, Signor Alessandro Luzio.\r\n\r\n“All keyed instruments also are pleasing to the ear, because they\r\nproduce very perfect consonances, and upon them one can play many things\r\nthat fill the mind with musical delight. And not less charming is the\r\nmusic of the stringed quartet, which is most sweet and exquisite. The\r\nhuman voice lends much ornament and grace to all these instruments, with\r\nwhich I would have our Courtier at least to some degree acquainted,\r\nalbeit the more he excels with them, the better,—without troubling\r\nhimself much with those that Minerva forbade to Alcibiades, because it\r\nseems that they are ungraceful.[157]\r\n\r\n“Then, as to the time for enjoying these various kinds of music, I think\r\nit is whenever a man finds himself in familiar and beloved companionship\r\nand there are not other occupations. But above all it is fitting where\r\nladies are present, because their aspect fills the listener’s heart with\r\nsweetness, renders it more sensitive to the tenderness of the music, and\r\nquickens the musician’s soul.\r\n\r\n“As I have already said, it pleases me well that we should avoid the\r\ncrowd, and especially the ignoble crowd. But discretion must needs be\r\nthe spice of everything, for it would be quite impossible to foresee all\r\nthe cases that occur; and if the Courtier rightly understands himself,\r\nhe will adapt himself to the occasion and will perceive when the minds\r\nof his hearers are disposed to listen and when not. He will take his own\r\nage into account: for it is indeed unseemly and unlovely in the extreme\r\nto see a man of any quality,—old, hoary and toothless, full of\r\nwrinkles,—playing on a viol and singing in the midst of a company of\r\nladies, even though he be a passable performer. And the reason of this\r\nis that in singing the words are usually amourous, and love is a\r\nridiculous thing in old men,—albeit it is sometimes pleased among its\r\nother miracles to kindle frozen hearts in spite of years.”\r\n\r\n14.—Then the Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Do not deprive old men of this pleasure, messer Federico; for in my\r\ntime I have known old men who had right perfect voices and hands very\r\ndexterous upon their instruments, far more than some young men.”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish,” said messer Federico, “to deprive old men of this\r\npleasure, but I do wish to deprive you and these ladies of the pleasure\r\nof laughing at such folly. And if old men wish to sing to the viol, let\r\nthem do so in secret and only to drive from their minds those painful\r\nthoughts and grievous troubles with which our life is filled, and to\r\ntaste that rapture which I believe Pythagoras and Socrates found in\r\nmusic.[158] And even although they practise it not, by somewhat\r\naccustoming their minds to it they will enjoy it far more when they hear\r\nit than a man who knows nothing of it. For just as the arms of a smith,\r\nwho is weak in his other members, become stronger by exercise than those\r\nof another man who is more robust but unaccustomed to use his arms,—in\r\nlike manner ears practised in harmony will perceive it better and more\r\nspeedily and will appreciate it with far greater pleasure, than others,\r\nhowever good and sharp they be, that are not versed in the varieties of\r\nmusical consonance; because these modulations do not penetrate ears\r\nunused to hearing them, but pass aside without leaving any savour of\r\nthemselves; albeit even the beasts have some enjoyment in melody.\r\n\r\n“This then is the pleasure it is fitting old men should take in music. I\r\nsay the like of dancing, for in truth we ought to give up these\r\nexercises before our age forces us to give them up against our will.”\r\n\r\nHere my lord Morello replied with a little heat:\r\n\r\n“So it is better to exclude all old men, and to say that only young men\r\nhave a right to be called Courtiers.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“You see, my lord Morello, that they who like these things strive to\r\nseem young when they are not, and hence they dye their hair and shave\r\ntwice a week.[159] And this is because nature silently tells them that\r\nsuch things are proper only to the young.”\r\n\r\nAll the ladies laughed, for each one of them felt that these words\r\nfitted my lord Morello; and he seemed rather stung by them. Messer\r\nFederico soon continued:\r\n\r\n15.—“But there are many other ways of entertaining ladies that are\r\nproper to old men.”\r\n\r\n“What are they?” said my lord Morello. “Telling stories?”\r\n\r\n“That is one,” replied messer Federico. “But as you know, every age\r\nbrings its own thoughts with it, and has some peculiar virtue and some\r\npeculiar vice. Thus, while old men are ordinarily more prudent than\r\nyoung men, more continent and wiser, so too they are more garrulous,\r\nmiserly, querulous and timid; they are always scolding about the house,\r\nharsh to their children, and wish everyone to follow their way. And on\r\nthe contrary young men are spirited, generous, frank, but prone to\r\nquarrel, voluble, loving and hating in an instant, eager in all their\r\npleasures, unfriendly to him who counsels well.\r\n\r\n“But of all ages, that of manhood is the most temperate, because it has\r\nleft the faults of youth behind and has not yet reached those of old\r\nage. Being placed then at the two extremes, young and old must needs\r\nlearn from reason how to correct the faults that nature implants in\r\nthem. Thus, old men ought to guard against much self-praise and the\r\nother evil habits that we have said are peculiar to them, and to use\r\nthat prudence and knowledge which they have gained from long experience,\r\nand to be like oracles consulted of all men; and in telling what they\r\nknow, they ought to have the grace to speak to the point and temper the\r\ngravity of their years with a certain mild and sportive humour. In this\r\nway they will be good Courtiers, enjoy their intercourse with men and\r\nwith ladies, and be always welcome,—without singing or dancing; and when\r\nneed arises they will display their worth in affairs of importance.\r\n\r\n16.—“Let young men use this same care and judgment, not indeed in\r\ncopying old men’s ways,—for that which befits the one would not at all\r\nbefit the other, and we are wont to say that over wisdom is a bad sign\r\nin the young,—but in correcting their own natural faults. Hence I\r\ngreatly like to see a youth, and especially when handling weapons, who\r\nhas a touch of the grave and taciturn; who is master of himself, without\r\nthose restless manners which are often seen at that age; because such\r\nyouths seem to have a certain something in them above the rest. Moreover\r\nthis quietness of manner has in it a kind of impressive boldness,\r\nbecause it seems the result not of anger but of judgment, and governed\r\nmore by reason than by passion. This is nearly always found in all men\r\nof high courage, and we see it also among those brute animals that have\r\nmore nobility and strength than their fellows,—as in the lion and the\r\neagle.\r\n\r\n“Nor is this strange; for an impetuous and sudden movement,—which\r\nwithout words or other signs of wrath abruptly bursts with all its force\r\nat once from the quiet that is its contrary, as it were like the\r\ndischarge of a cannon,—is far more violent and furious than that which\r\nincreases by degrees and grows hotter little by little. Therefore they\r\nwho talk much and move about and cannot stand still, when they have an\r\nenterprise on foot, seem thus to exhaust their powers; and as our friend\r\nmesser Pietro Monte well says, they act like boys who sing from fear\r\nwhen they walk at night, as if to keep up their courage by their\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n“Again, just as calm and thoughtful youthfulness is very praiseworthy in\r\na young man, because the levity which is the fault peculiar to his age\r\nseems to be tempered and corrected,—so in an old man a green and lively\r\nold age is to be highly esteemed, because his stoutness of heart seems\r\nto be so great as to warm and strengthen his feeble and chill years, and\r\nto keep him in that middle state which is the best part of our life.\r\n\r\n17.—“But in brief not even all these qualities in our Courtier will\r\nsuffice to win universal favour of lords, cavaliers and ladies, unless\r\nhe has also a gentle and amiable manner in daily talk. And I verily\r\nbelieve it to be difficult to give any rule for this, because of the\r\ninfinite variety of things that arise in conversation, and because among\r\nall the men on earth no two are found who have minds quite alike. So\r\nwhoever has to prepare himself for conversation with many, must needs be\r\nguided by his own judgment, and distinguishing the differences between\r\none man and another, must daily change his style and method according to\r\nthe character of the person with whom he has to converse. Nor could I\r\nfor my part give other rules in this matter than those already given,\r\nwhich our friend my lord Morello has learned at the confessional from\r\nhis youth up.”\r\n\r\nHere my lady Emilia laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“You shirk labour too much, messer Federico. But you shall not succeed,\r\nfor you must talk on until it is time to go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“And what, my Lady, if I have nothing to say?” replied messer Federico.\r\n\r\n“There you shall show your wit,” said my lady Emilia. “And if what I\r\nonce heard be true, that there was a man so clever and eloquent that he\r\ndid not lack material to write a book in praise of a fly, others in\r\npraise of the fourth day ague, and another in praise of baldness,—will\r\nyou also not have the courage to find something to say about\r\nCourtiership for one evening?”[160]\r\n\r\n“We have already said enough about it to make two books,” replied messer\r\nFederico. “But since my excuse is of no avail, I will talk until you\r\nthink I have fulfilled, if not my duty, at least the limit of my powers.\r\n\r\n18.—“I think that the conversation which the Courtier ought most to try\r\nin every way to make acceptable, is that which he holds with his prince;\r\nand although this word ‘conversation’ implies a certain equality that\r\nseems impossible between a lord and his inferior, yet we will call it so\r\nfor the present. Therefore, besides daily showing everyone that he\r\npossesses the worth we have already described, I would have the Courtier\r\nstrive, with all the thoughts and forces of his mind, to love and almost\r\nto adore the prince whom he serves, above every other thing, and mould\r\nhis wishes, habits and all his ways to his prince’s liking.”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for more, Pietro da Napoli here said:\r\n\r\n“We already have enough Courtiers of this kind, for methinks you have in\r\na few words described for us a noble flatterer.”\r\n\r\n“You are much in errour,” replied messer Federico; “for flatterers love\r\nneither their prince nor their friends, which I tell you I wish chiefly\r\nin our Courtier.\r\n\r\n“Moreover it is possible without flattery to obey and further the wishes\r\nof him we serve, for I am speaking of those wishes that are reasonable\r\nand right, or of those that in themselves are neither good nor evil,\r\nsuch as would be a liking for play or a devotion to one kind of exercise\r\nabove another. And I would have the Courtier bend himself to this even\r\nif he be by nature alien to it, so that on seeing him his lord shall\r\nalways feel that he will have something agreeable to say; which will\r\ncome about if he has the good judgment to perceive what his prince\r\nlikes, and the wit and prudence to bend himself thereto, and a\r\ndeliberate purpose to like that which perhaps he by nature dislikes. And\r\nadopting these precautions, he will never be out of humour or melancholy\r\nbefore his prince, nor so taciturn as many are who seem to bear a grudge\r\nagainst their patrons, which is a truly odious thing. He will not be\r\ngiven to evil speaking, especially against his own lords; which often\r\nhappens, for in courts there seems to rage a fury[161] of such sort that\r\nthose who have been most favoured by their lord and have been raised to\r\neminence from the lowest state, are always complaining and speaking ill\r\nof him; which is unseemly not only in such as these, but even in those\r\nwho chance to have been ill used.\r\n\r\n“Our Courtier will show no foolish presumption; he will not be a bearer\r\nof evil tidings; he will not be thoughtless in sometimes saying things\r\nthat offend instead of pleasing as he intends. He will not be obstinate\r\nand disputatious, as some are who seem to delight in nothing but to be\r\ntroublesome and disagreeable like flies, and who make a point of\r\nspitefully contradicting everyone without discrimination. He will not be\r\nan idle or untruthful tattler, nor a boaster nor pointless flatterer,\r\nbut modest and reserved, always and especially in public showing that\r\nreverence and respect which befit the servant towards the master; and he\r\nwill not behave like many, who on meeting any great prince, with whom if\r\nonly they have spoken but once, press forward with a certain smiling and\r\nfriendly look, as if they wished to caress an equal or show favour to an\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\n“He will very rarely or almost never ask anything of his lord for\r\nhimself, lest his lord, being reluctant to deny it to him directly, may\r\nsometimes grant it with an ill grace, which is much worse. Even in\r\nasking for others he will choose his time discreetly and ask proper and\r\nreasonable things; and he will so frame his request, by omitting what he\r\nknows may displease and by skilfully doing away with difficulties, that\r\nhis lord shall always grant it, or shall not think him offended by\r\nrefusal even if it be denied; for when lords have denied a favour to an\r\nimportunate suitor, they often reflect that he who asked it with such\r\neagerness, must have desired it greatly, and so having failed to obtain\r\nit, must feel ill will towards him who denied it; and believing this,\r\nthey begin to hate the man and can never more look upon him with favour.\r\n\r\n19.—“He will not seek to intrude unasked into his master’s chamber or\r\nprivate retreats, even though he be of great consequence; for when great\r\nlords are in private, they often like a little liberty to say and do\r\nwhat they please, and do not wish to be seen or heard by any who may\r\ncriticise them; and it is very proper. Hence I think those men do ill\r\nwho blame great lords for consorting privately with persons who are of\r\nlittle worth save in matters of personal service, for I do not see why\r\nlords should not have the same freedom to relax their minds that we fain\r\nwould have to relax ours. But if a Courtier accustomed to deal with\r\nimportant matters, chances to find himself in private with his lord, he\r\nmust put on another face, postpone grave concerns to another place and\r\ntime, and give the conversation a cast that shall amuse and please his\r\nlord, so as not to disturb that repose of mind of which I speak.\r\n\r\n“In this however, as in everything else, let him above all take care not\r\nto weary his lord, and let him wait for favours to be offered him rather\r\nthan angle for them so openly as many do, who are so greedy that it\r\nseems as if they must die if they do not get what they seek; and if they\r\nhappen to meet any disfavour or to see others favoured, they suffer such\r\nanguish that they can in no wise hide their envy. Thus they make\r\neveryone laugh at them, and often are the cause that leads their master\r\nto bestow favour on the first comer simply to spite them. Then again, if\r\nthey find themselves in at all more than common favour, they become so\r\nintoxicated by it that they stand palsied[162] with joy, and seem not to\r\nknow what to do with their hands and feet, and they can hardly keep from\r\ncalling on the company to come and see and congratulate them as upon\r\nsomething to which they are quite unused.\r\n\r\n“Of such sort I would not have our Courtier. I am quite willing that he\r\nshould like favours, but not that he should value them so highly as to\r\nseem unable to do without them. And when he receives them, let him not\r\nseem unused or strange to them, or marvel that they are offered him; nor\r\nlet him refuse them, as some do who refrain from accepting them out of\r\nmere ignorance, and thus seem to the bystanders to be conscious of not\r\ndeserving them.\r\n\r\n“Yet a man ought always to be a little more backward than his rank\r\nwarrants; to accept not too readily the favours and honours that are\r\noffered him; and to refuse them modestly, showing that he values them\r\nhighly, yet in such fashion as to give the donor cause to offer them\r\nagain with far more urgency. For the greater the reluctance with which\r\nthey are accepted, the more highly will the prince who gives them think\r\nhimself esteemed, and the benefit that he bestows will seem the greater,\r\nthe more the recipient seems to prize it and to hold himself honoured by\r\nit. Moreover these are the true and solid favours that make a man\r\nesteemed by those who see him from without; for, being unsought, they\r\nare assumed by everyone to be the reward of true worth, the more so when\r\nthey are accompanied by modesty.”\r\n\r\n20.—Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks you have stolen this passage from the Evangelist, where he\r\nsays: ‘When thou art bidden to a wedding, go and sit down in the lowest\r\nroom; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say: Friend, go up\r\nhigher: and thus shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit\r\nat meat with thee.’”[163]\r\n\r\nMesser Federico laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“It were too great sacrilege to steal from the Evangelist; but you are\r\nmore learned in Holy Writ than I thought;” then he went on: “You see\r\nwhat great danger those men sometimes run who boldly begin conversation\r\nbefore a lord without being invited; and to put them down, the lord\r\noften makes no reply and turns his head another way, and even if he\r\nreplies to them, everyone sees that he does it with an ill grace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CESAR DE GONZAGA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LUDOVICO CANOSSA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PIETRO BEMBO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BERNARDO DE BIBBIENA\r\n\r\n               AUTOGRAPH SIGNATURES OF THE AUTHOR AND OF\r\n                          FOUR OF HIS FRIENDS\r\n\r\nFrom negatives, made by Premi and by Signor Lanzoni, from originals\r\n    preserved in the Royal State Archives at Mantua and selected by the\r\n    Director, Signor Alessandro Luzio.\r\n\r\n“To have the favour of princes, then, there is no better way than to\r\ndeserve it. And when we see another man who is pleasing to a prince for\r\nany reason, we must not think to reach the same height ourselves by\r\nimitating him, for all things are not proper to all men. Thus there will\r\nsometimes be found a man who by nature is so ready at jesting that\r\nwhatever he may say carries laughter with it, and he seems to have been\r\nborn solely for that; and if another man, who has a sober habit of mind\r\n(however excellently endowed) tries to do the like, it will fall so cold\r\nand flat as to disgust those who hear him, and he will prove exactly\r\nlike that ass who tried to copy the dog by frolicking with their\r\nmaster.[164] Hence every man must understand himself and his own powers,\r\nand govern himself accordingly, and consider what things he ought to\r\nimitate, and what things he ought not.”\r\n\r\n21.—Here Vincenzo Calmeta said:\r\n\r\n“Before you go on, if I heard aright I think you said awhile ago that\r\nthe best way to win favours is to deserve them, and that the Courtier\r\nought to wait for them to be offered him rather than ask for them\r\npresumptuously. I greatly fear this rule is little to the purpose, and I\r\nthink experience very clearly teaches us the contrary. For to-day very\r\nfew are favoured by their lords, save the presumptuous; and I know you\r\ncan give good testimony as to some, who on finding themselves in small\r\nfavour with their princes, have made themselves acceptable solely by\r\ntheir presumption. While as for those who have risen through modesty, I\r\nfor my part do not know any, and I even give you time to think about it\r\nand believe you will find few. And if you consider the court of France,\r\nwhich is to-day one of the noblest in Christendom, you will find that\r\nall men who have universal favour there are somewhat presumptuous, and\r\nnot only towards one another but towards the king himself.”\r\n\r\n“Now do not say that,” replied messer Federico; “for in France there are\r\nvery modest and courteous gentlemen. It is true that they behave with a\r\ncertain freedom and unceremonious familiarity, which are proper and\r\nnatural to them; and therefore it ought not to be called presumption,\r\nbecause in this very manner of theirs, whilst they deride and make sport\r\nof the presumptuous, yet they rate highly those who seem to them to have\r\nworth and modesty.”\r\n\r\nCalmeta replied:\r\n\r\n“Look at the Spaniards, who it seems are our masters in Courtiership,\r\nand consider how many you will find who are not very presumptuous with\r\nladies and with gentlemen; and even more so than the French, because at\r\nfirst sight they show the greatest modesty. And in this they are truly\r\nclever, for as I said, the princes of our time all favour only those who\r\nhave such manners.”\r\n\r\n22.—Then messer Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“I will by no means suffer you, messer Vincenzo, to cast this reproach\r\nupon the princes of our time. For indeed there are also many who love\r\nmodesty, which I do not however say alone suffices to make a man\r\nacceptable; but I do say that when united to high worth, it greatly\r\nhonours its possessor. And although it be silent about itself,\r\npraiseworthy deeds speak aloud and are far more admirable than if they\r\nwere accompanied by presumption and rashness. I will not indeed deny\r\nthat there are many presumptuous Spaniards, but I say that those who are\r\nmuch esteemed are as a rule very modest.\r\n\r\n“Again, there are also some men who are so reserved that they shun human\r\ncompany beyond reason, and so far exceed a certain limit of moderation\r\nthat they come to be regarded as either too timid or too proud. For\r\nthese I have no praise, nor would I have modesty so dry and arid as to\r\nbecome clownishness; but let the Courtier be fluent on occasion, and\r\nprudent and sagacious in discussing statecraft, and let him have the\r\ngood sense to adapt himself to the customs of the nations where he finds\r\nhimself; then in lesser matters let him be agreeable and speak well\r\nabout everything.\r\n\r\n“But above all, he should make for right; not envious, not evil-tongued:\r\nnor let him ever bring himself to seek grace or favour by foul ways or\r\ndishonourable means.”\r\n\r\nThen Calmeta said:\r\n\r\n“I assure you that all other ways are more uncertain and longer than\r\nthis one which you censure. For to repeat, princes at the present day\r\nlove only those who tread that path.”\r\n\r\n“Say not so,” then replied messer Federico, “for that would be too clear\r\nan argument that the princes of our time are all vicious and\r\nwicked,—which is not true, since several good ones are to be found. But\r\nif our Courtier should chance to find himself in the service of one who\r\nis vicious and malign, let him depart as soon as he discovers it, lest\r\nhe suffer that keen anguish which all good men feel who serve the\r\nwicked.”\r\n\r\n“We must needs pray God,” replied Calmeta, “to send us good masters, for\r\nwhen we have them, we are forced to endure them such as they are;\r\nbecause an infinity of reasons constrain a gentleman not to leave the\r\npatron he has once begun to serve; but the misfortune consists in\r\nbeginning to serve a bad patron, and Courtiers in this condition are\r\nlike those unhappy birds that are hatched in a gloomy valley.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said messer Federico, “that duty ought to outweigh all\r\nother reasons. And provided a gentleman does not leave his patron when\r\nat war or in adversity,—lest he be thought to have done so to better his\r\nfortunes or because he feared that he might lack opportunity for gain,—I\r\nthink that at any other time he rightly may and ought to leave a service\r\nthat is like to disgrace him before all good men; for everyone assumes\r\nthat whoever serves the good is good, and that whoever serves the wicked\r\nis wicked.”\r\n\r\n23.—Then my lord Ludovico Pio said:\r\n\r\n“I should like to have you clear a doubt that is in my mind; that is,\r\nwhether a gentleman in the service of a prince is bound to obey him in\r\nall things that he commands, even if they be dishonourable and\r\ninfamous.”\r\n\r\n“In dishonourable things we are not bound to obey any man,” replied\r\nmesser Federico.\r\n\r\n“And how,” returned my lord Ludovico, “if I am in the service of a\r\nprince who uses me well and trusts to my doing for him all that can be\r\ndone, commanding me to go kill a man or do anything else you\r\nplease,—ought I to refuse to do it?”\r\n\r\n“You ought,” replied messer Federico, “to obey your lord in all things\r\nthat are advantageous and honourable to him, not in those that bring him\r\ninjury and disgrace. Therefore if he were to command you to commit an\r\nact of treachery, not only would you not be bound to do it, but you\r\nwould be bound not to do it,—both for your own sake and for the sake of\r\nnot being a minister to your lord’s disgrace. True it is that many\r\nthings which are evil seem at first sight good, and many seem evil and\r\nyet are good. Hence in our lords’ service it is sometimes permitted to\r\nkill not one man but ten thousand, and to do many other things that\r\nwould seem evil to a man who did not rightly consider them, and yet are\r\nnot evil.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar Pallavicino replied:\r\n\r\n“On your faith, I pray you discuss this a little, and teach us how the\r\nreally good can be distinguished from that which only seems so.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said messer Federico; “I am unwilling to enter upon that,\r\nfor there would be too much to say; but let the whole matter be left to\r\nyour own wisdom.”\r\n\r\n24.—“At least clear another doubt for me,” returned my lord Gaspar.\r\n\r\n“And what doubt?” said messer Federico.\r\n\r\n“It is this,” replied my lord Gaspar. “I should like to know,—my lord\r\nhaving charged me exactly what I must do in an enterprise or any other\r\nbusiness whatever, if I being engaged upon it think that my doing more\r\nor less or otherwise than I was charged, may make the affair turn out\r\nbetter and more advantageously for him who gave me the task,—whether I\r\nought to govern myself by the original plan without exceeding the limits\r\nof my command, or on the contrary to do that which seems to me better.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“In this I should give you the precept and example of Manlius Torquatus\r\n(who in like case slew his son, from too stern a sense of duty), if I\r\nthought he deserved much credit, which I do not.[165] And yet I dare not\r\nblame him against the verdict of so many centuries. For without doubt it\r\nis a very perilous thing to deviate from our superiors’ commands,\r\nrelying more on our own judgment than on theirs whom we ought in reason\r\nto obey; because if our expectation fails and the affair turns out ill,\r\nwe run into the errour of disobedience and ruin that which we have to\r\ndo, without any possibility of excuse or hope of pardon. On the other\r\nhand, if the affair turns out according to our wish, we must give the\r\ncredit to fortune and be content at that. Moreover in this way a fashion\r\nis set of rating the commands of our superiors lightly; and following\r\nthe example of one man who happened to succeed and who perhaps was\r\nprudent and had reasoned well and been aided by fortune too,—a thousand\r\nother ignorant featherheads will make bold to do as they please in the\r\nmost important matters, and for the sake of showing that they are\r\nsagacious and have authority, to deviate from their masters’ commands;\r\nwhich is a very evil thing and often the cause of numberless mistakes.\r\n\r\n“But I think that in such a case the man whom it concerns ought to\r\nconsider carefully, and as it were to place in the balance the profit\r\nand advantage that he stands to win by acting contrary to orders, in\r\ncase his design turns out according to his hopes; and on the other hand\r\nto weigh the evil and disadvantage that will accrue if the affair\r\nchances to turn out ill through his disobedience of orders. And if he\r\nfinds the damage in case of failure to be greater and more serious than\r\nthe gain in case of success, he ought to restrain himself and carry out\r\nhis orders to the letter; while on the contrary if the gain in case of\r\nsuccess is like to be more serious than the damage in case of failure, I\r\nthink he may properly venture to do that which his reason and judgment\r\ndictate, and somewhat disregard the very letter of his orders,—so as to\r\nact like good merchants, who to gain much risk little, but never risk\r\nmuch to gain little.\r\n\r\n“I strongly approve of the Courtier’s observing above all the character\r\nof the prince whom he serves, and of his governing himself accordingly:\r\nfor if it be severe, as is the case with many, I should never advise\r\nanyone who was my friend to change one jot the order given him; lest\r\nthat might befall him which is recorded as having befallen a master\r\nengineer of the Athenians, to whom Publius Crassus Mucianus,[166] when\r\nhe was in Asia and wished to besiege a fortified place, sent to ask for\r\none of two ship’s masts that he had seen at Athens, in order to make a\r\nram wherewith to batter down the wall, and said he wished the larger\r\none. Being very intelligent, the engineer knew that the larger mast was\r\nunsuitable for the purpose, and as the smaller one was easier to\r\ntransport and better adapted for making the machine in question, he sent\r\nit to Mucianus. The latter, hearing how things had gone, sent for the\r\npoor engineer, asked why he had disobeyed his orders, and refusing to\r\nlisten to any excuse from him, caused him to be stripped naked and so\r\nflogged and scourged with rods that he died, because it seemed to\r\nMucianus that instead of obeying, the man had tried to offer advice. So\r\nwe had best use great caution with these rigourous men.\r\n\r\n25.—“But now let us leave this subject of intercourse with princes, and\r\ncome to conversation with our equals or with those that are nearly so:\r\nfor we must pay heed to this also, since it is universally more\r\npractised and a man more often finds himself engaged in it than in\r\nconversation with princes.\r\n\r\n“There are however some simpletons, who, even in the company of the best\r\nfriend they have in the world, on meeting a man who is better dressed,\r\nat once attach themselves to him, and then if they happen on one still\r\nbetter dressed, they do the like to him. And later, when the prince is\r\npassing through the squares or churches or other public places, they\r\nelbow their way past everyone until they reach his side: and even if\r\nthey have naught to say to him, they still must talk, and go on\r\nbabbling, and laugh and clap their hands and head, to show they have\r\nbusiness of importance, so that the crowd may see them in favour. But\r\nsince these fellows deign to speak only with their lords, I would not\r\nhave us deign to speak of them.”\r\n\r\n26.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano said:\r\n\r\n“As you have mentioned those who are so fond of the company of well\r\ndressed men, I should like you to show us, messer Federico, in what\r\nmanner the Courtier ought to dress, and what costume is suitable to him,\r\nand in what way he ought to govern himself in all matters of bodily\r\nadornment. For in this we find an infinite variety: some who dress after\r\nthe French fashion, some after the Spanish, some who wish to appear\r\nGerman; nor is there lack of those who even dress after the style of\r\nTurks: some who wear their beards, some not. Hence in this medley it\r\nwere well to know how to choose the best.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico said:\r\n\r\n“Indeed I should not know how to give a precise rule about dress, except\r\nthat a man ought to follow the custom of the majority; and since (as you\r\nsay) this custom is so various, and the Italians are so fond of arraying\r\nthemselves after foreign fashions, I think every man may dress as he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\n“But I do not know by what fate it happens that Italy has not, as it was\r\nwont to have, a costume that should be recognized as Italian: for\r\nalthough the putting of these new fashions into use may have made the\r\nformer ones seem very rude, yet the old ones were perhaps a badge of\r\nfreedom, as the new ones have proved an augury of servitude, which I\r\nthink is now very clearly fulfilled.[167] And as it is recorded that\r\nwhen Darius had the Persian sword which he wore at his side fashioned\r\nafter the Macedonian style, the year before he fought with Alexander,\r\nthis was interpreted by the soothsayers to signify that they into whose\r\nfashion Darius had transformed his Persian sword, should come to rule\r\nover Persia.[168] So our having changed our Italian garb for that of\r\nstrangers seems to signify that all those for whose garb we have\r\nexchanged our own must come to conquer us: which has been but too true,\r\nfor there is now left no nation that has not made us its prey: so that\r\nlittle more is left to prey upon, and yet they do not cease preying upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\n27.—“But I do not wish to touch on painful subjects. Therefore it will\r\nbe well to speak of our Courtier’s clothes; which I think, provided they\r\nbe not out of the common or inappropriate to his profession, may do very\r\nwell in other respects if only they satisfy him who wears them. True it\r\nis that I for my part should not like them to be extreme in any wise, as\r\nthe French are sometimes wont to be in over amplitude, and the Germans\r\nin over scantiness,—but as they both are, only corrected and improved in\r\nform by the Italians. Moreover I always like them to tend a little\r\ntowards the grave and sober rather than the gay. Thus I think black is\r\nmore suitable for garments than any other colour is; and if it is not\r\nblack, let it at least be somewhat dark. And this I say of ordinary\r\nattire, for there is no doubt that bright and cheerful colours are more\r\nsuitable over armour, and for gala use also dress may be fringed, showy\r\nand magnificent; likewise on public occasions, such as festivals, shows,\r\nmasquerades, and the like. For such garments carry with them a certain\r\nliveliness and gaiety that accord very well with arms and sports. But\r\nfor the rest I would have our Courtier’s dress display that sobriety\r\nwhich the Spanish nation greatly affect, for things external often bear\r\nwitness to the things within.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“This would give me little concern, for if a gentleman is of worth in\r\nother things, his attire will never enhance or lessen his reputation.”\r\n\r\n“You say truly,” replied messer Federico. “Yet what one of us is there,\r\nwho, on seeing a gentleman pass by with a garment on his back quartered\r\nin divers colours, or with a mass of strings and knotted ribbons and\r\ncross lacings, does not take him for a fool or a buffoon?”\r\n\r\n“Neither for a fool,” said messer Pietro Bembo, “nor for a buffoon would\r\nhe be taken by anyone who had lived any time in Lombardy, for all men go\r\nabout like that.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said my lady Duchess, laughing, “if all men go about like that,\r\nwe must not cast it at them as a fault, since this attire is as fitting\r\nand proper to them as it is for the Venetians to wear puffed\r\nsleeves,[169] or for the Florentines to wear the hood.”\r\n\r\n“I am not speaking,” said messer Federico, “more of Lombardy than of\r\nother places, for both the foolish and the wise are to be found in every\r\nnation. But to say what I think is important in attire, I wish that our\r\nCourtier may be neat and dainty throughout his dress, and have a certain\r\nair of modest elegance, yet not of a womanish or vain style. Nor would I\r\nhave him more careful of one thing than of another, like many we see who\r\ntake such pains with their hair that they forget the rest; others devote\r\nthemselves to their teeth, others to their beard, others to their boots,\r\nothers to their bonnets, others to their coifs;[170] and the result is\r\nthat these few details of elegance seem borrowed by them, while all the\r\nrest, being very tasteless, is recognized as their own. And this kind of\r\ndress I would have our Courtier shun, by my advice; adding also that he\r\nought to consider how he wishes to seem and of what sort he wishes to be\r\nesteemed, and to dress accordingly and contrive that his attire shall\r\naid him to be so regarded even by those who neither hear him speak nor\r\nwitness any act of his.”\r\n\r\n28.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks it is not fitting, or even customary among persons of worth,\r\nto judge men’s quality by their dress rather than by their words and\r\nacts; for many would make mistakes, nor is it without reason that we\r\nhave the proverb, ‘dress makes not the monk.’”\r\n\r\n“I do not say,” replied messer Federico, “that fixed opinions of men’s\r\nworth are to be formed only in this way, or that they are not better\r\nknown by their words and acts than by their dress: but I do say that\r\ndress is no bad index of the wearer’s fancy, although it may be\r\nsometimes wrong; and not only this, but all ways and manners, as well as\r\nacts and words, are an indication of the qualities of the man in whom\r\nthey are seen.”\r\n\r\n“And what things do you find,” replied my lord Gaspar, “from which we\r\nmay form an opinion, that are neither words nor acts?”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“You are too subtle a logician. But to tell you what I mean, there are\r\nsome acts that still endure after they are performed, such as building,\r\nwriting, and the like; others do not endure, such as those I have now in\r\nmind. In this sense, therefore, I do not say that walking, laughing,\r\nlooking, and the like, are acts,—and yet all these outward things often\r\ngive knowledge of those within. Tell me, did you not judge that friend\r\nof ours, of whom we were speaking only this morning, to be a light and\r\nfrivolous man as soon as you saw him walking with that twist of his\r\nhead, wriggling about, and with affable demeanour inviting the\r\nby-standers to doff their caps to him? So, too, when you see anyone\r\ngazing too intently with dull eyes after the manner of an idiot, or\r\nlaughing as stupidly as those goitrous mutes in the mountains of\r\nBergamo,[171]—do you not set him down a very simpleton, although he\r\nneither speak nor do aught else? Thus you see that these ways and\r\nmanners (which I do not for the present regard as acts) in great measure\r\nmake men known to us.\r\n\r\n29.—“But another thing seems to me to give and to take away from\r\nreputation greatly, and this is our choice of the friends with whom we\r\nare to live in intimate relations; for doubtless reason requires that\r\nthey who are joined in close amity and fast companionship, shall have\r\ntheir desires, souls, judgments and minds also in accord. Thus, he who\r\nconsorts with the ignorant or wicked, is deemed ignorant or wicked; and\r\non the contrary, he who consorts with the good, the wise, and the\r\ndiscreet, is himself deemed to be the like. Because by nature everything\r\nseems to join willingly with its like. Therefore I think we ought to use\r\ngreat care in beginning these friendships, for he who knows one of two\r\nclose friends, at once imagines the other to be of the same quality.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Pietro Bembo replied:\r\n\r\n“I certainly think we ought to take great care to limit ourselves to\r\nfriends of like mind with us, as you say, not only because of the gain\r\nor loss of reputation, but because there are to-day very few true\r\nfriends to be found, nor do I believe that the world any longer contains\r\na Pylades and Orestes, a Theseus and Pirithous, or a Scipio and\r\nLælius.[172] On the contrary, by some fatality it happens every day that\r\ntwo friends, who have lived in very cordial love for many years, yet in\r\nsome way cheat each other at last, either through malice, or jealousy,\r\nor fickleness, or some other evil cause: and each gives the other the\r\nblame which perhaps both deserve.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, since it has more than once happened to me to be deceived by\r\nhim whom I most loved above every other person, and by whom I was sure I\r\nwas loved,—I have sometimes thought to myself that it would be well for\r\nus never to trust anyone in the world, nor so to give ourselves up to\r\nany friend (however dear and loved he be) as to reveal all our thoughts\r\nto him, as we should to ourselves; for there are so many dark corners\r\nand recesses in our minds that it is impossible for human wit to\r\npenetrate the deceptions they conceal. Hence I think it were well to\r\nlove and serve one more than another according to merit and worth; yet\r\nnever to be so sure of friendship’s sweet enticement, that we at last\r\nhave cause to rue our trust.”\r\n\r\n30.—Then messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“Verily the loss would be far greater than the gain, if human\r\nintercourse were to be deprived of that highest pitch of friendship\r\nwhich in my opinion gives us all the good our life has in it; and\r\ntherefore I will in no wise admit that what you say is reasonable, nay\r\nrather I venture to assert, and for the clearest reasons, that without\r\nthis perfect friendship men would be far unhappier than all other\r\ncreatures. And if some profanely stain this sacred name of friendship,\r\nwe ought not on that account to uproot it from our hearts, and for the\r\nguilt of the wicked deprive the good of such felicity. And for my part I\r\nthink there are here among us more than one pair of friends, whose love\r\nis steadfast and without deceit and lasting unto death with like\r\ndesires, no less than if they were those ancients whom you mentioned\r\nawhile ago; and it happens thus when a man chooses a friend, not only\r\nfrom heaven-born impulse, but like himself in character. And in all this\r\nI am speaking of the good and virtuous, for the friendship of the wicked\r\nis not friendship.\r\n\r\n“I am well pleased that so close a tie as this should not join or bind\r\nmore than two, for otherwise perhaps it would be dangerous; because, as\r\nyou know, it is harder to attune three musical instruments together,\r\nthan two. Therefore, I would that our Courtier might have one special\r\nand hearty friend, if possible, of the kind we have described; then that\r\nhe might love, honour and respect all others according to their worth\r\nand merits, and always contrive to consort more with such as are in high\r\nesteem and noble and of known virtue, than with the ignoble and those of\r\nlittle worth; in such wise that he may be loved and honoured by them\r\nalso. And he will accomplish this if he be courteous, kind, generous,\r\naffable and mild with others, zealous and active to serve and guard his\r\nfriends’ welfare and honour both absent and present, enduring such of\r\ntheir natural defects as are endurable, without breaking with them for\r\nslight cause, and correcting in himself those that are kindly pointed\r\nout; never thrusting himself before others to reach the first and most\r\nhonoured places; nor acting like some, who seem to despise the world and\r\ninsist with a kind of tiresome preciseness on laying down the law for\r\neveryone, and who, besides being unseasonably contentious in every\r\nlittle thing, censure that which they do not do themselves, and are\r\nalways seeking occasion for complaint against their friends,—which is a\r\nvery odious thing.”\r\n\r\n31.—Messer Federico pausing here, my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“I should like to have you speak a little more in detail than you do\r\nabout this matter of converse with our friends; for in truth you keep\r\nmuch to generalities, and show us things in passing, as it were.”\r\n\r\n“How ‘in passing’?” replied messer Federico. “Perhaps you would have me\r\ntell the very words that you must use? Do you not think we have talked\r\nenough about this?”\r\n\r\n“Enough I think,” replied my lord Gaspar. “Yet I should like to hear a\r\nfew more details about the manner of intercourse with men and women; for\r\nthe thing seems to me of great importance, seeing that most of our time\r\nat courts is given to it; and if it were always the same, it would soon\r\nbecome tedious.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” replied messer Federico, “we have given the Courtier\r\nknowledge of so many things, that he can easily vary his conversation\r\nand adapt himself to the quality of the persons with whom he has to do,\r\npresupposing he has good sense and governs himself by it, and sometimes\r\nturns to grave matters and sometimes to festivals and games, according\r\nto the occasion.”\r\n\r\n“And what games?” said my lord Gaspar.\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Let us ask advice of Fra Serafino, who invents new ones every day.”\r\n\r\n“Jesting apart,” answered my lord Gaspar, “do you think it would be a\r\nvice in the Courtier to play at cards and dice?”\r\n\r\n“Not I,” said messer Federico, “unless he did so too constantly and\r\nneglected more important matters for them, or indeed unless he played\r\nfor nothing else but to win money, and cheated the company, and showed\r\nsuch grief and vexation at losing as to argue himself a miser.”\r\n\r\n“And what,” replied my lord Gaspar, “do you say of the game of chess?”\r\n\r\n“It is certainly a pleasant and ingenious amusement,” said messer\r\nFederico. “But I think there is one defect in it. And that is, there is\r\ntoo much to know, so that whoever would excel in the game of chess must\r\nspend much time on it, methinks, and give it as much study as if he\r\nwould learn some noble science or do anything else of importance you\r\nplease; and yet in the end with all his pains he has learned nothing but\r\na game. Therefore I think a very unusual thing is true of it, namely\r\nthat mediocrity is more praiseworthy than excellence.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“Many Spaniards excel in this and divers other games, yet without giving\r\nthem much study or neglecting other things.”\r\n\r\n“Believe me,” replied messer Federico, “they do give much study thereto,\r\nalthough covertly. But those other games you speak of, besides chess,\r\nare perhaps like many I have seen played (although of little moment),\r\nwhich serve only to make the vulgar marvel; wherefore methinks they\r\ndeserve no other praise or reward than that which Alexander the Great\r\ngave the fellow who at a good distance impaled chick-peas on the point\r\nof a needle.[173]\r\n\r\n32.—“But since it appears that fortune exerts immense power over men’s\r\nopinions as over many other things, we sometimes see that a gentleman,\r\nhowever well conditioned he may be and endowed with many graces, is\r\nunacceptable to a prince, and goes against the grain as we say;[174] and\r\nthis without any apparent reason, so that as soon as he comes into the\r\nprince’s presence and before he is known by the others, although he be\r\nkeen and ready with retorts, and display himself to advantage in\r\ngestures, manners, words, and all else that is becoming,—the prince will\r\nshow small esteem for him, nay will soon put some affront upon him. And\r\nthus it will come about that the others will follow the prince’s lead,\r\nand everyone will regard the man as of little worth, nor will there be\r\nany to prize or esteem him, or laugh at his amusing talk or hold him in\r\nany respect; nay, all will begin to deride and persecute him. Nor will\r\nit be enough for the poor man to make good retorts or take things as if\r\nsaid in jest, for the very pages will set upon him, so that even if he\r\nwere the sturdiest man in the world, he must perforce remain foiled and\r\nridiculed.\r\n\r\n“And on the other hand, if the prince shows favour to a very dolt, who\r\nknows neither how to speak nor how to act,—his manners and ways (however\r\nsilly and uncouth they be) will often be praised by everyone with\r\nexclamations and astonishment, and the whole court will seem to admire\r\nand respect him, and everyone will appear to laugh at his jests and at\r\ncertain rustic and stupid jokes that ought to excite rather disgust than\r\nlaughter: to such degree are men firm and fixed in the opinions that are\r\nengendered by the favour and disfavour of lords.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I would have our Courtier set off his worth as best he can,\r\nwith cleverness and skill, and whenever he has to go where he is strange\r\nand unknown, let him take care that good opinion of him precedes him,\r\nand see to it that men there shall know of his being highly rated in\r\nother places, among other lords, ladies and gentlemen; for that fame\r\nwhich seems to spring from many judgments, begets a kind of firm belief\r\nin a man’s worth, which, in minds thus disposed and prepared, is then\r\neasily maintained and increased by his conduct: moreover he escapes that\r\nannoyance which I feel when asked who I am and what my name is.”\r\n\r\n33.—“I do not see how this can help,” replied messer Bernardo Bibbiena;\r\n“for it has several times happened to me, and I think to many others,\r\nthat having been led by the word of persons of judgment to imagine\r\nsomething to be of great excellence before I saw it,—on seeing it I\r\nfound it paltry and was much disappointed of what I expected. And the\r\nreason was simply that I had put too much trust in report and formed in\r\nmy mind so high an expectation, that although the real thing was great\r\nand excellent, yet when afterwards measured by the fact, it seemed very\r\npaltry by comparison with what I had imagined. And I fear it may be so\r\nwith our Courtier too. Therefore I do not see the advantage of raising\r\nsuch expectations and sending our fame before us; for the mind often\r\nimagines things that it is impossible to fulfil, and thus we lose more\r\nthan we gain.”\r\n\r\nHere messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“The things that you and many others find inferior to their reputation,\r\nare for the most part of such sort that the eye can judge of them at a\r\nglance,—as if you had never been at Naples or Rome, and from hearing\r\nthem so much talked of, you were to imagine something far beyond what\r\nthey afterwards proved to be when seen; but such is not the case with\r\nmen’s character, because that which is outwardly seen is the least part.\r\nThus, on first hearing a gentleman speak, if you should not find in him\r\nthat worth which you had previously imagined, you would not at once\r\nreverse your good opinion of him, as you would in those matters whereof\r\nthe eye is instant judge, but you would wait from day to day to discover\r\nsome other hidden virtue, still holding fast to the good impression you\r\nhad received from so many lips; and later, if he were thus richly\r\nendowed (as I assume our Courtier to be), your confidence in his\r\nreputation would be hourly confirmed, because his acts would justify it,\r\nand you would be always imagining something more than you saw.\r\n\r\n34.—“And surely it cannot be denied that these first impressions have\r\nvery great weight, and that we ought to be very careful regarding them.\r\nAnd to the end that you may see how important they are, I tell you that\r\nin my time I knew a gentleman, who, while he was of very gentle aspect\r\nand modest manners and also valiant in arms, yet did not so greatly\r\nexcel in any of these things but that he had many equals and even\r\nsuperiors. However, fate so willed that a lady chanced to fall most\r\nardently in love with him, and her love increasing daily with the signs\r\nthat the young man gave of loving her in return, and there being no way\r\nfor them to speak together, she was moved by excess of passion to reveal\r\nher desires to another lady through whom she hoped to secure some\r\nassistance. This lady was in no wise inferior to the first in rank or\r\nbeauty; whence it came to pass, that on hearing the young man (whom she\r\nhad never seen) spoken of so tenderly, and perceiving that he was\r\nextravagantly loved by her friend (whom she knew to be very discreet and\r\nof excellent judgment), she straightway imagined him to be the\r\nhandsomest and wisest and most discreet and in short the most lovable\r\nman in the world. And thus, without having seen him, she became so\r\npassionately enamoured of him, that she began making every effort to\r\nsecure him, not for her friend but for herself, and inducing him to\r\nreturn her love: which she succeeded in doing with little effort, for in\r\ntruth she was a lady rather to be wooed than to woo others.\r\n\r\n“Now hear the end of my tale. Not long afterwards it happened that a\r\nletter, which this second lady had written to her lover, fell into the\r\nhands of still another lady, also very noble and of good character and\r\nrarest beauty,—who, being like most ladies curious and eager to learn\r\nsecrets and especially other ladies’, opened this letter, and on reading\r\nit saw that it was written with the fervour of ardent love. And the\r\nsweet, impassioned words that she read first moved her to compassion for\r\nthat lady, for she well knew from whom the letter came and to whom it\r\nwas going; then they gained such power, that as she turned them over in\r\nher mind and considered what sort of man he must be who could arouse\r\nsuch love in the lady, she too straightway fell in love with him; and\r\nthe letter had perhaps a greater effect than if it had been sent by the\r\nyoung man to her. And as it sometimes happens that a poisoned dish,\r\nintended for a prince, kills the first comer who tastes it, so in her\r\nover greediness this poor lady drank the love poison that had been\r\nprepared for another.\r\n\r\n“What more shall I say? The affair became well known, and spread abroad\r\nso that many other ladies besides these, partly to spite the others and\r\npartly to imitate them, used every effort and pains to possess\r\nthemselves of the man’s love, and contended for it with one another as\r\nboys contend for cherries. And all this began with the first impression\r\nof that lady who saw him so beloved by another.”\r\n\r\n35.—Here my lord Gaspar Pallavicino replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“To give reasons in support of your opinion, you cite the doings of\r\nwomen, who for the most part are quite unreasonable. And if you cared to\r\ntell the whole truth, this favourite of so many women must have been a\r\ndunce and at bottom a man of little worth. For their way is always to\r\nfavour the meanest, and like sheep to do what they see others doing,\r\nwhether it be good or evil. Moreover they are so jealous among\r\nthemselves, that even if the man had been a monster, they would have\r\ntried to steal him from one another.”\r\n\r\nHere many began to speak, and nearly everyone wanted to contradict my\r\nlord Gaspar; but my lady Duchess imposed silence on all, and then said,\r\nlaughing:\r\n\r\n“If the evil you say of women were not so far from the truth, that the\r\nsaying of it casts blame and shame on him who says it rather than on\r\nthem, I should allow you to be answered. But I am not willing that, by\r\nbeing confronted with the arguments which it is possible to cite, you\r\nshould be cured of this evil habit, in order that you may suffer very\r\ngrievous punishment for your fault: which shall be the bad opinion\r\nwherein you will be held by all who hear you argue in such fashion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GIACOPO SANNAZARO\r\n  1458-1530\r\n]\r\n\r\nHead enlarged from a photograph, specially made by Alinari, of a part of\r\n    the fresco, “Leo X’s Entry into Florence,” in the Palazzo Vecchio at\r\n    Florence, by Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574). See Milanesi’s edition of\r\n    Vasari’s _Opere_, viii, 142.\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“My lord Gaspar, do not say that women are so very unreasonable, even if\r\nthey are sometimes moved to love by others’ judgment rather than by\r\ntheir own; for gentlemen and many wise men do the same. And if I may say\r\nthe truth, you yourself and all the rest of us here do often and even\r\nnow trust more to the opinion of others than to our own. And in proof of\r\nthis, it is not long ago that certain verses, handed about this court\r\nunder the name of Sannazaro,[175] seemed very excellent to everyone and\r\nwere praised with wonder and applause; then, it being known for certain\r\nthat they were by another hand, they promptly sank in reputation and\r\nwere thought less than mediocre. And a certain motet,[176] which was\r\nsung before my lady Duchess, found no favour and was not thought good\r\nuntil it was known to be the work of Josquin de Près.[177]\r\n\r\n“What clearer proof of the weight of opinion would you have? Do you not\r\nremember that in drinking a certain wine, you at one time pronounced it\r\nperfect, and at another most insipid? And this because you believed\r\nthere were two kinds of wine, one from the Genoese Riviera, and the\r\nother from this country; and even when the mistake was discovered, you\r\nwould not at all believe it,—so firmly fixed in your mind was that wrong\r\nopinion, although you had received it from the report of others.\r\n\r\n36.—“Hence the Courtier ought to take great care to make a good\r\nimpression at the start, and to consider how mischievous and fatal a\r\nthing it is to do otherwise. And they of all men run this danger, who\r\npride themselves on being very amusing and on having acquired by these\r\npleasantries of theirs a certain freedom that makes it proper and\r\npermissible for them to do and say whatever occurs to them, without\r\ntaking thought about it. Thus they often begin a thing they know not how\r\nto finish, and then try to help matters by raising a laugh; and yet they\r\ndo this so clumsily that it does not succeed, insomuch that they rouse\r\nthe utmost disgust in him who sees or hears them, and fail most\r\nlamentably.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, thinking it to be droll and witty, they say the foulest and\r\nmost indecent things before and even to honourable ladies; and the more\r\nthey make these ladies blush, the more they rate themselves good\r\nCourtiers, and they laugh and pride themselves on having such a fine\r\naccomplishment, as they deem it. Yet they commit all this folly with no\r\nother aim than to be esteemed jovial fellows: this is the one name which\r\nseems to them worthy of praise and of which they boast more than of any\r\nother; and to acquire it, they utter the grossest and most shameful\r\nvileness in the world. Often they throw one another down-stairs, clap\r\nbillets of wood and bricks on one another’s backs, cast handfulls of\r\ndust in one another’s eyes, make one another’s horses run into ditches\r\nor down some hill; then at table they throw soups, sauces, jellies and\r\nevery kind of thing in one another’s faces:[178] and then they laugh.\r\nAnd he who can excel the others in these things, esteems himself to be\r\nthe best Courtier and the most gallant, and thinks he has won great\r\nglory. And if they sometimes invite a gentleman to these carouses of\r\ntheirs, and he does not choose to join in their unmannerly jokes, they\r\nat once say he stands too much on his dignity, and holds himself aloof,\r\nand is not a jovial fellow. But I have worse to tell you. There are some\r\nwho rival one another and award the palm to him who can eat and drink\r\nthe vilest and most offensive things; and they devise dishes so\r\nabhorrent to human sense that it is impossible to recall them without\r\nextreme disgust.”\r\n\r\n37.—“And what may these be?” said my lord Ludovico Pio.\r\n\r\nMesser Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“Ask the Marquess Febus, who has often seen them in France, and perhaps\r\nhas taken part.”\r\n\r\nThe Marquess Febus replied:\r\n\r\n“I have seen none of these things done in France that are not done in\r\nItaly as well. But what is good among the Italians in dress, sports,\r\nbanquets, handling arms, and in everything else that befits a\r\nCourtier,—all comes from the French.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“I do not say that very noble and modest cavaliers are not also to be\r\nfound among the French, and I myself have known many who were truly\r\nworthy of every praise. But some are little circumspect, and generally\r\nspeaking it seems to me that as regards breeding the Spaniards have more\r\nin common with the Italians than the French have; because that grave\r\nreserve peculiar to the Spaniards befits us far more than the quick\r\nvivacity which among the French we see in almost every movement, and\r\nwhich is not unseemly in them, nay is charming, for it is so natural and\r\nproper to them as not to seem at all affected. There are very many\r\nItalians who earnestly strive to copy this manner; and they can only\r\nshake their heads in speaking and make clumsy crosswise bows, and walk\r\nso fast that their lackeys cannot keep up with them when they pass\r\nthrough the city. And with these ways they seem to themselves to be good\r\nFrenchmen and to have the same freedom of manner, which in truth rarely\r\nhappens save with those who have been bred in France and have acquired\r\nthe manner in their youth.\r\n\r\n“The same is true of knowing many languages; which I approve highly in\r\nthe Courtier, especially Spanish and French, because the intercourse of\r\nboth these nations with Italy is very frequent, and they have more in\r\ncommon with us than any of the others have; and their two princes,[179]\r\nbeing very powerful in war and very glorious in peace, always have their\r\ncourts full of noble cavaliers, who spread throughout the world; and it\r\nis necessary for us also to converse with them.\r\n\r\n38.—“I do not care at present to go more into detail in speaking of\r\nthings that are too well known, such as that our Courtier ought not to\r\navow himself a great eater or drinker, or given to excess in any evil\r\nhabit, or vile and ungoverned in his life, with certain peasant ways\r\nthat recall the hoe and plough a thousand miles away; because a man of\r\nthis kind not only may not hope to become a good Courtier, but can be\r\nset to no more fitting business than feeding sheep.\r\n\r\n“And finally I say it were well for the Courtier to know perfectly that\r\nwhich we have said befits him, so that every possible thing may be easy\r\nto him, and everyone may marvel at him,—he at no one. But be it\r\nunderstood that there ought not to be in him that lofty and ungenial\r\nindifference which some men have who show they are not surprised at what\r\nothers do because they imagine they can do it better, and who disparage\r\nit by silence as not worth speaking of; and they almost seem to imply\r\nthat no one is their equal or even able to fathom the profundity of\r\ntheir knowledge. Wherefore the Courtier ought to shun these odious ways,\r\nand to praise the fine achievements of other men with kindness and good\r\nwill; and although he may feel that he is admirable and far superior to\r\nall, yet he ought to appear not to think so.\r\n\r\n“But since such complete perfection as this is very rarely and perhaps\r\nnever found in human nature, a man who is conscious of being lacking in\r\nsome particular, ought not to despond thereat or lose hope of reaching a\r\nhigh standard, even though he cannot attain that perfect and supreme\r\nexcellence to which he aspires. For in every art there are many grades\r\nthat are honourable besides the highest, and whoever aims at the highest\r\nwill seldom fail to rise more than half-way. Therefore if our Courtier\r\nexcels in anything besides arms, I would have him get profit and esteem\r\nfrom it in fine fashion; and I would have him so discreet and sensible\r\nas to be able with skill and address to attract men to see and hear that\r\nwherein he thinks he excels, always appearing not to do it from\r\nostentation, but by chance and at others’ request rather than by his own\r\nwish. And in everything he has to do or say, let him if possible come\r\nready and prepared, yet appearing to act impromptu throughout. In those\r\nthings, however, wherein he feels himself to be mediocre, let him touch\r\nin passing, without dwelling much upon them, albeit in such fashion that\r\nhe may be thought to know more about them than he shows himself to know:\r\nlike certain poets, who sometimes touched lightly upon the profoundest\r\ndepths of philosophy and other sciences, of which perhaps they\r\nunderstood little. Then, in that of which he knows he is wholly\r\nignorant, I would never have him make any pretence or seek to win any\r\nfame; nay if need be, let him frankly confess his ignorance.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEONARDO DA VINCI\r\n  “...ONE OF THE FIRST PAINTERS OF THE WORLD...”\r\n  1452-1519\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 79.207) of Leonardo’s drawing in\r\n    the Royal Library at Windsor. For an account of this and other less\r\n    authentic portraits, see Müntz’s life of Leonardo da Vinci (London:\r\n    1898), ii, 225 _et seq._\r\n\r\n39.—“That,” said Calmeta, “is not what Nicoletto[180] would have done,\r\nwho was a very excellent philosopher but knew no more about law than\r\nabout flying. When a Podestà[181] of Padua had decided to give him a\r\nlectureship in law, he was never willing (although urged thereto by many\r\nscholars) to undeceive the Podestà and confess his ignorance,—always\r\nsaying that he did not agree with the opinion of Socrates in this\r\nmatter, and that it was not seemly for a philosopher ever to say that he\r\nwas ignorant of anything.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“I do not say that of his own notion and unasked by others, the Courtier\r\nshould volunteer to tell his ignorance; for I too dislike this folly of\r\nself-accusal and depreciation. And therefore I sometimes inwardly laugh\r\nat certain men, who needlessly and of their own accord narrate things\r\nthat perhaps occurred without their fault but yet imply a shade of\r\ndisgrace; like a cavalier whom you all know, and who, whenever he heard\r\nmention made of the battle that was fought against King Charles in the\r\nParmesan,[182] at once began to tell the manner of his flight, nor\r\nseemed to have seen or heard aught else that day; again, speaking of a\r\ncertain famous joust, he always described how he had fallen, and in his\r\nconversation he often seemed to seek an opportunity to tell how he had\r\nreceived a sound cudgelling one night as he was on his way to meet a\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n“I would not have our Courtier tell such follies. It seems to me,\r\nhowever, that when occasion offers for displaying himself in something\r\nof which he is quite ignorant, he ought to avoid it; and if compelled by\r\nnecessity, he ought to confess his ignorance frankly rather than put\r\nhimself to that risk. And in this way he will escape the censure that\r\nmany nowadays deserve, who from some perverse instinct or unreasonable\r\ndesign always set themselves to do that which they do not know, and\r\nforsake that which they do know. And as an instance of this, I know a\r\nvery excellent musician, who, having abandoned music, gave himself up\r\nwholly to composing verses, and thinks himself very great therein, and\r\nmakes all men laugh at him; and now he has lost even his music.\r\n\r\n“Another man, one of the first painters of the world, despises the art\r\nwherein he is most rare, and has set himself to study philosophy; in\r\nwhich he has such strange conceptions and new chimeras, that he could\r\nnot with all his painter’s art depict them.[183] And of such as these, a\r\ncountless number could be found.\r\n\r\n“Some indeed there are who know they excel in one thing and yet make\r\ntheir chief business of another, of which they are not ignorant either;\r\nbut every time they have occasion to display themselves in that wherein\r\nthey feel themselves proficient, they do it gallantly. And it sometimes\r\ncomes to pass that the company, seeing them do well in that which is not\r\ntheir profession, think they can do far better in that which they make\r\ntheir profession. This art, if it be accompanied by good judgment, is by\r\nno means unpleasing to me.”\r\n\r\n40.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino replied:\r\n\r\n“This seems to me not art but mere deceit; nor do I think it fitting for\r\nhim who would be a man of honour, ever to deceive.”\r\n\r\n“It is an embellishment, which graces what he does,” said messer\r\nFederico, “rather than deceit; and even if it be deceit, it is not to be\r\ncensured. Will you not also say that of two men fencing, the one who\r\ntouches the other, deceives him? And this is because the one has more\r\nart than the other. And if you have a jewel that is beautiful without\r\nsetting, and it afterwards comes into the hands of a good goldsmith, who\r\nby skilful setting makes it look far more beautiful, will you not say\r\nthat this goldsmith deceives the eyes of anyone who sees it? And yet he\r\ndeserves praise for his deceit, for with good judgment and art his\r\nmaster hand often adds grace and beauty to ivory or silver, or to a\r\nbeautiful stone by encircling it with fine gold. Therefore let us not\r\nsay that art,—or such deceit as this, if you will call it so,—deserves\r\nany censure.\r\n\r\n“Nor is it unseemly for a man who is conscious of doing something well,\r\ndexterously to seek occasion for showing himself therein, and at the\r\nsame time to conceal what he thinks undeserving of praise,—but always\r\nwith a touch of wary dissimulation. Do you not remember that without\r\nappearing to seek them, King Ferdinand[32] found opportunities now and\r\nthen to go about in his doublet? and this because he felt himself to be\r\nvery agile; and that, as his hands were not over good, he rarely or\r\nalmost never took off his gloves? And there were very few that perceived\r\nhis cunning. Moreover I think I have read that Julius Cæsar liked to\r\nwear the laurel wreath to hide his baldness.[184] But in all these\r\nmatters it is needful to be very cautious and to use good judgment, in\r\norder not to go beyond bounds; for in avoiding one errour a man often\r\nruns into another, and in his wish to win praise, receives censure.\r\n\r\n41.—“Hence in our mode of life and conversation, it is a very safe thing\r\nto govern ourselves with a certain decorous discretion, which in truth\r\nis a very great and very strong shield against envy, which we ought to\r\navoid as much as possible. Moreover I wish our Courtier to guard against\r\ngetting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even\r\nthose who do not deserve it. Therefore in his talk let him always take\r\ncare not to go beyond the probable, and also not to tell too often those\r\ntruths that have the look of falsehood,[185]—like many who never speak\r\nsave of miracles, and wish to carry such authority that every incredible\r\nthing shall be believed from them. Others, at the beginning of a\r\nfriendship and in order to gain favour with their new friend, swear the\r\nfirst day they speak with him that there is no one in the world whom\r\nthey love more than him, and that they would gladly die to do him\r\nservice, and like things beyond reason. And when they part from him,\r\nthey pretend to weep and to be unable to speak a word from grief. Thus,\r\nin their wish to be thought very loving, they come to be esteemed liars\r\nand silly flatterers.\r\n\r\n“But it would be too long and tedious to recount all the faults that may\r\nbe committed in our manner of conversation. Hence as regards what I\r\ndesire in the Courtier, let it suffice to say, besides the things\r\nalready said, that he should be of such sort as never to be without\r\nsomething to say that is good and well suited to those with whom he is\r\nspeaking, and that he should know how to refresh the minds of his\r\nhearers with a certain sweetness, and by his amusing witticisms and\r\npleasantries to move them cleverly to mirth and laughter, so that\r\nwithout ever becoming tedious or producing satiety, he may give pleasure\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\n42.—“At last I think my lady Emilia will give me leave to be silent. And\r\nif she refuse me, I shall by my own talk stand convicted of not being\r\nthe good Courtier whereof I have spoken for not only does good talk\r\n(which perhaps you have neither now nor ever heard from me), but even\r\nsuch talk as I usually have at command (whatever that may be worth),\r\nquite fail me.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Prefect said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“I am not willing to let this false opinion,—that you are not a most\r\nadmirable Courtier,—rest in the mind of any of us; for it is certain\r\nthat your desire to be silent proceeds rather from a wish to escape\r\nlabour than from lack of something to say. So, to the end that nothing\r\nmay seem to be neglected in such worthy company as this and such\r\nadmirable talk, be pleased to teach us how we must employ the\r\npleasantries that you have just mentioned, and to show us the art that\r\npertains to all this kind of amusing talk, so as to excite laughter and\r\nmirth in gentle fashion; for indeed methinks it is very important and\r\nwell befitting the Courtier.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord,” replied messer Federico, “pleasantries and witticisms are the\r\ngift and grace of nature rather than of art; but in this matter certain\r\nnations are to be found more ready than others, like the Tuscans, who in\r\ntruth are very clever. It seems to me that the use of witticism is very\r\nnatural to the Spaniards too. Yet there are many, both of these and of\r\nall other nations, who from over loquacity sometimes go beyond bounds\r\nand become silly and pointless, because they do not consider the kind of\r\nperson with whom they are speaking, the place where they are, the\r\noccasion, or the soberness and modesty which they ought above all things\r\nto maintain.”\r\n\r\n43.—Then my lord Prefect replied:\r\n\r\n“You deny that there is any art in pleasantries, and yet by speaking ill\r\nof those who use them not with modesty and soberness and who regard not\r\nthe occasion and the persons with whom they are speaking, methinks you\r\nshow that even this can be taught and has some method in it.”\r\n\r\n“These rules, my Lord,” replied messer Federico, “are so universal that\r\nthey fit and apply to everything. But I said there is no art in\r\npleasantries, because I think there are only two kinds of them to be\r\nfound: one of which stretches out in long and continuous talk, as we see\r\nin the case of certain men who narrate and describe so gracefully and\r\namusingly something that has happened to them or that they have seen or\r\nheard, that they set it before our eyes with gestures and words and\r\nalmost make us touch it with the hand; and for lack of other word, we\r\nmay perhaps call this the humourous or urbane manner. The other kind of\r\nwitticism is very short, and consists solely in sayings that are quick\r\nand sharp, such as are often heard among us, or biting; nor are they\r\nacceptable unless they sting a little. By the ancients also they were\r\ncalled apothegms: at present some call them _arguzie_.[186]\r\n\r\n“So I say that in the first kind, which is humourous narrative, there is\r\nno need of any art, because nature herself creates and fashions men\r\nfitted to narrate amusingly, and gives them features, gestures, voice\r\nand words proper to imitate what they will. In the other kind, that of\r\n_arguzie_, what can art avail? For whatever it be, a pungent saying must\r\ndart forth and hit the mark before he who utters it shall seem to have\r\ngiven it a thought; otherwise it is flat and has no savour. Therefore I\r\nthink it is all the work of intellect and nature.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Pietro Bembo took up the talk, and said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Prefect does not deny what you say, that nature and intellect\r\nplay the chief part, especially as regards conception. Still it is\r\ncertain that every man’s mind, however fine his intellect may be,\r\nconceives both good things and bad, and more or less; yet judgment and\r\nart then polish and correct them, and cull out the good and reject the\r\nbad. So lay aside what pertains to intellect, and explain to us what\r\nconsists in art; that is, of the pleasantries and witticisms that excite\r\nlaughter, tell us what are befitting the Courtier and what are not, and\r\nin what time and way they should be used; for this is what my lord\r\nPrefect asks of you.”\r\n\r\n44.—Then messer Federico said laughingly:\r\n\r\n“There is no one of us here to whom I do not yield in everything, and\r\nespecially in being jocular; unless perhaps nonsense, which often makes\r\nothers laugh more than bright sayings, be also counted as pleasantry.”\r\nAnd then turning to Count Ludovico and to messer Bernardo Bibbiena, he\r\nsaid: “Here are the masters of witticism, from whom I must first learn\r\nwhat to say if I am to speak of jocose sayings.”[187]\r\n\r\nCount Ludovico replied:\r\n\r\n“Methinks you are already beginning to practise what you say you know\r\nnothing of, I mean in that you try to make these gentlemen laugh by\r\nridiculing messer Bernardo and me; for every one of them knows you far\r\nexcel us in that for which you praise us. If you are fatigued, then, you\r\nhad better beg my lady Duchess to postpone the rest of our talk until\r\nto-morrow, instead of trying to escape fatigue by subterfuge.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico began to make answer, but my lady Emilia quickly\r\ninterrupted him and said:\r\n\r\n“It is not in order for the discussion to spend itself in your praises;\r\nit is enough that you are all well known. But as I remember, Sir Count,\r\nthat you accused me last evening of not distributing the labour equally,\r\nit were well to let messer Federico rest awhile, and to give messer\r\nBernardo Bibbiena the task of speaking about pleasantries, because we\r\nnot only know him to be very amusing in continuous talk, but we remember\r\nthat he has several times promised us to try to write upon this subject,\r\nand hence we may believe that he has already thought much about it, and\r\ntherefore ought to satisfy us fully. Afterwards, when we have finished\r\ndiscussing pleasantries, messer Federico shall go on with what he has\r\nleft to say about the Courtier.”\r\n\r\nThereupon messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, I do not know what I have left to say; but like the wayfarer\r\nat noon, weary with the fatigue of his long journey, I will refresh\r\nmyself with messer Bernardo’s talk and the sound of his words, as if\r\nunder some delightful and shady tree, with the soft murmur of a plashing\r\nspring. Then perhaps, being revived a little, I shall be able to say\r\nsomething more.”\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“If I show you my head, you shall see what shade is to be expected from\r\nthe leafage of my tree.[188] As for listening to the murmur of that\r\nplashing spring, perhaps you may; for I was once turned into a spring,\r\nnot by any of the ancient gods but by our friend Fra Mariano,[60] and I\r\nhave never stood in need of water from then till now.”\r\n\r\nThen everyone began to laugh, for this pleasantry referred to by messer\r\nBernardo happened at Rome in the presence of Cardinal Galeotto of San\r\nPietro ad Vincula,[189] and was well known to all.\r\n\r\n45.—The laughter having ceased, my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“Now stop making us laugh by your use of pleasantries, and teach us how\r\nwe are to use them, and from what they are derived, and all you know\r\nabout the subject. And to lose no more time, begin at once.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BERNARDO DOVIZI DA BIBBIENA\r\n  1470-1520\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 42.158) of the portrait, in the\r\n    Pitti Gallery at Florence, long attributed to Raphael (1483-1520),\r\n    but regarded by Morelli as the work of a pupil.\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said messer Bernardo, “that the hour is late; and to the end\r\nthat my talk about pleasantries may not itself lack pleasantry and be\r\ntedious, perhaps it will be well to postpone it until to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nHere many replied together that it was still far from the usual hour for\r\nending the discussion. Then, turning to my lady Duchess and to my lady\r\nEmilia, messer Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to escape this task; although, just as I am wont to\r\nmarvel at the presumption of those who venture to sing to the viol\r\nbefore our friend Giacomo Sansecondo,[190] so I ought not to talk about\r\npleasantries before an audience who understand what I should say far\r\nbetter than I.\r\n\r\n“However, not to give any of these gentlemen a pretext for refusing the\r\ncharge that may be laid upon them, I will tell as briefly as I can what\r\noccurs to me concerning the causes that excite laughter; which is so\r\npeculiar to us that in defining man we are wont to say that he is a\r\nlaughing animal. For laughter is found only among men, and is nearly\r\nalways the sign of a certain hilarity felt inwardly in the mind, which\r\nis by nature drawn towards amusement and longs for repose and\r\nrecreation; wherefore we see many things devised by men to this end,\r\nsuch as festivals and different kinds of shows. And since we love those\r\nwho furnish us this recreation, it was the custom of ancient rulers\r\n(Roman, Athenian and many others), in order to gain the people’s good\r\nwill and to feast the eyes and minds of the multitude, to erect great\r\ntheatres and other public edifices, and therein to exhibit new sports,\r\nhorse and chariot races, combats, strange beasts, comedies, tragedies\r\nand mimes. Nor were such shows eschewed by grave philosophers, who in\r\nsports of this kind and banquets often relaxed their minds when fatigued\r\nby lofty discourse and spiritual meditation; which thing all kinds of\r\nmen also like to do: for not only toilers in the field, sailors, and all\r\nthose who perform hard and rough labour with their hands, but holy\r\npriests, and prisoners awaiting death from hour to hour, all seek\r\ncontinually some remedy and solace for their refreshment. Hence\r\neverything that moves to laughter, cheers the mind and gives pleasure,\r\nand for the moment frees us from the memory of those weary troubles of\r\nwhich our life is full. So laughter, as you see, is very delightful to\r\nall, and greatly to be praised is he who excites it reasonably and in a\r\ngraceful way.\r\n\r\n“But what laughter is, and where it abides, and how it sometimes seizes\r\nupon our veins, eyes, mouths and sides, and seems as if it would make us\r\nburst, so that with all our effort it cannot be restrained,—I will leave\r\nDemocritus to tell, who could not even if he were to promise.[191]\r\n\r\n46.—“Now the occasion and as it were the source from which the laughable\r\nsprings, lies in a kind of distortion; for we laugh only at those things\r\nthat have incongruity in them and that seem amiss without being so. I\r\nknow not how to explain it otherwise; but if you think of it yourselves,\r\nyou will see that what we laugh at is nearly always something that is\r\nincongruous and yet is not amiss.\r\n\r\n“Next I will try to tell you, as far as my judgment shall show me, what\r\nthe means are that the Courtier ought to use for the purpose of exciting\r\nlaughter, and within what bounds; because it is not seemly for the\r\nCourtier to be always making men laugh, nor yet by those means that are\r\nmade use of by fools or drunken men, by the silly, the nonsensical, and\r\nlikewise by buffoons. And although these kinds of men seem to be in\r\ndemand at courts, yet they deserve not to be called Courtiers, but each\r\nby his own name, and to be held for what they are.\r\n\r\n“Moreover we must diligently consider the bounds and limits of exciting\r\nlaughter by derision, and who it is we deride; for laughter is not\r\naroused by jeering at a poor unfortunate nor yet at an open rascal and\r\nblackguard, because the latter seems to merit greater punishment than\r\nthat of being ridiculed, and the mind of man is not prone to flout the\r\nwretched, unless they boast of their wretchedness and are proud and\r\nsaucy. We ought also to treat with respect those who are universal\r\nfavourites and beloved by all and powerful, for by jeering at these\r\npersons a man may sometimes bring dangerous enmities upon himself. Yet\r\nit is proper to flout and laugh at the vices of those who are neither so\r\nwretched as to excite pity, nor so wicked as to seem worthy of capital\r\npunishment, nor so great that a touch of their wrath can do much harm.\r\n\r\n47.—“Again, you must know that from the same occasion whence we draw our\r\nlaughable witticisms, we may likewise draw serious phrases of praise or\r\ncensure, and sometimes by using the same words. Thus in praising a\r\ngenerous man who shares all he has with his friends, we are wont to say\r\nthat what he has is not his own; the same may be said in censuring a man\r\nwho has stolen or by other evil means acquired what he possesses. Also\r\nwe say, ‘That lady is of great price,’ meaning to praise her for\r\ndiscretion and goodness; the same thing might be said in dispraise of\r\nher, implying that anyone may have her.\r\n\r\n“But for this purpose we have a chance to use the same situations\r\noftener than the same words. Thus recently a lady being at mass in\r\nchurch with three cavaliers, one of whom served her in love,[192] a poor\r\nbeggar came up and taking his stand before the lady began to beg alms of\r\nher; and he repeated his petition several times to her with much\r\nimportunity and pitiful groaning; yet for all that she gave him no alms,\r\nnor still did she refuse it to him with a sign to go in peace, but\r\ncontinued to stand abstracted as if she were thinking of something else.\r\nThen the cavalier in love said to his two companions:\r\n\r\n“‘You see what I have to expect from my lady, who is so hard-hearted\r\nthat she not only gives no alms to that naked starving wretch who is\r\nbegging it of her so eagerly and often, but she will not even send him\r\naway. So much does she delight to see a man languishing in misery before\r\nher and vainly imploring her pity.’\r\n\r\n“One of his two friends replied:\r\n\r\n“‘This is not hardness of heart, but a silent lesson from the lady to\r\nteach you that she is never pleased with an importunate suitor.’\r\n\r\n“The other replied:\r\n\r\n“‘Nay, it is a warning to him that while she never grants what is asked\r\nof her, still she likes to be entreated for it.’\r\n\r\n“You see how the lady’s failure to send the poor man away, gave rise to\r\none saying of grave censure, one of moderate praise, and another of\r\nbiting satire.\r\n\r\n48.—“Proceeding now to declare the kinds of pleasantries that are\r\npertinent to our subject, I say that in my opinion there are three\r\nvarieties, although messer Federico mentioned only two: namely, that\r\nwhich consists in rendering the effect of a thing by means of urbane and\r\namusing long narrative, and that which consists in the swift and keen\r\nreadiness of a single phrase. But we will add a third sort called\r\npractical joking, in which long narratives and short sayings have place,\r\nand also some action.\r\n\r\n“Now the first, which consists in continuous talk, is of such sort as\r\nalmost to amount to story-telling. And to give you an instance: just at\r\nthe time when Pope Alexander the Sixth died and Pius the Third was\r\ncreated pope,[193] your fellow Mantuan, my lady Duchess, messer Antonio\r\nAgnello,[194] being at Rome and in the palace, happened to speak of the\r\ndeath of the one pope and of the other’s creation, and in discussing\r\nthis with some of his friends, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘My Lords, even in the days of Catullus[195] doors began to speak\r\nwithout a tongue and to listen without ears, and thus to reveal\r\nadulteries. Now, although men are not of such worth as they were in\r\nthose times, it may be that the doors (many of which are made of antique\r\nmarbles, at least here in Rome) have the same powers that they then had;\r\nand for my part I believe that these two here could clear away all our\r\ndoubts if we cared to learn from them.’\r\n\r\n“Then the gentlemen present were very curious, and waited to see how the\r\naffair was going to end. Whereupon messer Antonio, continuing to walk up\r\nand down, raised his eyes as if by chance to one of the two doors of the\r\nhall in which they were strolling, stopped a moment, and pointed out to\r\nhis companions the inscription over it, which was the name of Pope\r\nAlexander, followed by a V and an I, signifying Sixth as you know; and\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n“‘See what the door says: _Alessandro Papa vi_, which means that he\r\nbecame pope by the violence that he used, and that he accomplished more\r\nby violence than by reason. Now let us see if from the other we can\r\nlearn anything about the new pope.’ And turning to the other door as if\r\nby accident, he showed the inscription, N PP V, which signified\r\n_Nicolaus Papa Quintus_;[196] and he at once said: ‘Alas, bad news; this\r\none says, _Nihil Papa Valet_.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  POPE ALEXANDER VI\r\n  RODERIGO LENZUOLI (BORGIA)\r\n  1431-1503\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Alinari’s photograph (no. 17412) of a part of the fresco,\r\n    “The Resurrection,” in the Borgian Apartments in the Vatican, by\r\n    Bernardino di Betto di Biagio, better known as Pinturicchio,\r\n    (1454-1513).\r\n\r\n49.—“Now you see how elegant and admirable this kind of pleasantry is,\r\nand how becoming to a Courtier, whether the thing that is said be true\r\nor not; because in such a case it is allowable for a man to fabricate as\r\nmuch as he pleases, without blame; and in speaking the truth, to adorn\r\nit with a little falsity, overstating or understating as the occasion\r\nrequires. But in these matters perfect grace and true cleverness consist\r\nin picturing forth what we wish to say, with both word and gesture, so\r\nwell and with such ease that they who hear may seem to see before their\r\neyes the thing we tell them. And this graphic method is so effective\r\nthat it sometimes adorns and makes highly amusing a thing that in itself\r\nis neither very jocular nor clever.\r\n\r\n“And although this kind of narrative requires gesture and the aid of the\r\nspeaking voice, its quality is sometimes found in written compositions\r\nalso. Who does not laugh, when, in the Eighth Day of his Decameron,[197]\r\nGiovanni Boccaccio tells how the priest of Varlungo tried to chant a\r\n_Kyrie_ and a _Sanctus_ on discovering that his Belcolore was in the\r\nchurch. There are amusing narratives also in his stories of\r\nCalandrino,[198] and in many others. Of the same sort seems to be the\r\nraising of a laugh by mimicry or imitation, as we say,—wherein I have\r\nthus far seen no one more admirable than our friend messer Roberto da\r\nBari.”[48]\r\n\r\n50.—“This would be no small praise,” said messer Roberto, “if it were\r\ntrue; because I should of course try to imitate the good rather than the\r\nbad, and if I could make myself like some men I know, I should deem\r\nmyself very fortunate. I fear, however, that I know how to imitate only\r\nthose things which excite laughter, and which you just now said consist\r\nessentially in the imperfect.”\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo replied:\r\n\r\n“Imperfect, yes; but not unpleasantly so. And you must know that this\r\nimitation of which we are speaking, cannot be without cleverness; for\r\nbesides the way of governing words and gestures and setting before our\r\nhearers’ eyes the face and manners of the man we are speaking of, we\r\nmust needs be discreet, and pay great heed to the place and time, and to\r\nthe persons with whom we are speaking, and not descend to buffoonery or\r\ngo beyond bounds;—which rules you observe admirably and therefore know\r\nthem all, I think. For in truth it would little befit a gentleman to\r\nmake faces, to weep and laugh, and mimic voices, to wrestle with himself\r\nas Berto[65] does, or dress like a clown before everyone, like\r\nStrascino,[199]—and things of that kind, which are very fitting in those\r\nmen because it is their profession.\r\n\r\n“But for us it is needful to give only a fleeting and covert imitation,\r\nalways preserving the dignity of a gentleman, without uttering foul\r\nwords or performing acts that are less than seemly, without contorting\r\nthe face or person beyond measure; but to order our movements in such\r\nfashion that whoever hears and sees us may from our words and gestures\r\nimagine far more than what he sees and hears, and so be moved to\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“Moreover in our imitation we ought to avoid too stinging jibes,\r\nespecially at deformities of face or person; for while bodily defects\r\noften furnish excellent material for laughter to a man who uses them\r\nwith discretion, yet to employ this method too bitterly is the act not\r\nonly of a buffoon but of an enemy. So, although it be difficult, in this\r\nregard we must, as I have said, keep to the manner of our friend messer\r\nRoberto, who mimics all men and not without marking their defects\r\nsharply even to their face, and yet no one is annoyed or seems to take\r\nit amiss. And I will give no instance of this, because in him we see\r\ncountless examples of it every day.\r\n\r\n51.—“Another thing excites much laughter, although it is included under\r\nthe head of narration; and that is to describe gracefully certain\r\ndefects of others,—unimportant ones however and undeserving greater\r\npunishment, such as follies, sometimes mere absurdities or sometimes\r\naccompanied by a quick and pungent dash of liveliness; likewise certain\r\nextreme affectations; sometimes a huge and well-constructed lie. As\r\nwhen, a few days since, our friend Cesare told of a delightful\r\nabsurdity, which was that finding himself before the Podestà of this\r\nplace,[200] he saw a peasant come in to complain of being robbed of a\r\ndonkey. The fellow told of his poverty and of the trick played upon him\r\nby the thief, and then, to make out his loss the heavier, he said:\r\n‘Masters, if you had seen my donkey, you would have better understood\r\nhow much cause I have to grieve; for when he had his pack on, he looked\r\nlike a very Tullius.’[201]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ERCOLE D’ESTE\r\n  DUKE OF FERRARA\r\n  1431-1505\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from a photograph, specially made by Mansell, of an anonymous\r\n    bas-relief in the South Kensington Museum,—possibly the work of\r\n    Sperandio di Bartolommeo de’ Savelli (1425?-1500?).\r\n\r\n“And one of our friends, meeting a flock of goats with a great he-goat\r\nat their head, stopped and said with a look of admiration: ‘See what a\r\nhe-goat! He looks like a Saint Paul.’[202]\r\n\r\n“My lord Gaspar tells of having known an old servant of Duke Ercole of\r\nFerrara,[203] who offered the duke his two sons as pages; but before\r\nthey could begin their service, both the boys died. When the duke heard\r\nthis, he condoled with the father kindly, saying that he was very sorry,\r\nfor the only time when he had seen them, they had seemed to him very\r\npretty and gentle boys. The father replied: ‘My Lord, you saw nothing;\r\nfor within the last few days they had grown far handsomer and more\r\nvirtuous than I could possibly have believed, and already they sang\r\ntogether like two sparrow-hawks.’\r\n\r\n“And not long since one of our doctors stood looking at a man who had\r\nbeen condemned to be flogged about the piazza, and taking pity on him,\r\nbecause (although his shoulders were bleeding freely) the poor wretch\r\nwalked as slowly as if he had been out for a stroll to pass the time,\r\nthe doctor said to him: ‘Step out, poor fellow, and make haste to be\r\ndone with your pain.’ Whereat the goodman turned, and gazing at the\r\ndoctor as if amazed, he stood awhile without speaking, and then said:\r\n‘When you come to be flogged, you will go your own gait; so I choose to\r\ngo mine now.’\r\n\r\n“You surely must still remember that absurd story which my lord Duke[2]\r\nlately told of a certain abbot, who, being present one day when Duke\r\nFederico[26] was discussing what to do with the great mass of earth that\r\nhad been excavated to lay the foundations of this palace, which was then\r\nbuilding, said: ‘My Lord, I have thought of an excellent place to put\r\nit. Give orders to have an immense pit made, and it can be put in\r\nwithout further difficulty.’ Duke Federico replied, not without\r\nlaughter: ‘And where shall we put the earth to be dug out of this pit of\r\nyours?’ The abbot continued: ‘Have it made large enough to hold both.’\r\nAnd so, for all the duke repeated several times that the larger the pit\r\nwas made, the more earth would be dug out of it, the man could never get\r\nit into his brain that it could not be made large enough to hold both,\r\nand kept replying: ‘Make it so much the larger.’ Now you see what good\r\njudgment this abbot had.”\r\n\r\n52.—Then messer Pietro Bembo said:\r\n\r\n“And why do you not tell the story of your friend the Florentine\r\ncommander who was besieged in Castellina[204] by the Duke of Calabria?\r\nFinding one day some poisoned crossbow missiles that had been shot in\r\nfrom the camp, he wrote to the duke that if the warfare was to be\r\ncarried on so barbarously, he too would have medicine put on his cannon\r\nshot, and then woe to the one who had the worst of it.”[205]\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“Messer Pietro, if you do not hold your peace, I will tell all the\r\nthings I have seen and heard about your dear Venetians (which are not\r\nfew), and especially when they try to play the horseman.”\r\n\r\n“Do not so, I beg of you,” replied messer Pietro, “and I will keep quiet\r\nabout two other delightful tales that I know of the Florentines.”[206]\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“They must have rather been Sienese, who often slip in this way; as was\r\nrecently the case with one, who, on hearing some letters read in council\r\nwherein the phrase ‘the aforesaid’ was used (to avoid such frequent\r\nrepetition of the name of the man who was spoken of), said to the man\r\nwho was reading: ‘Stop there a moment and tell me, is this Aforesaid a\r\nfriend to our commune?’”\r\n\r\nMesser Pietro laughed, then said:\r\n\r\n“I am speaking of Florentines, not of Sienese.”\r\n\r\n“Speak out freely then,” added my lady Emilia, “and do not stand so much\r\non ceremony.”\r\n\r\nMesser Pietro continued:\r\n\r\n“When the Florentine Signory was waging war against the Pisans,[207]\r\nthey sometimes found their money exhausted by their great expenses; and\r\nthe method of finding money for daily needs being discussed in council\r\none day, after many ways had been proposed, one of the oldest citizens\r\nsaid: ‘I have thought of two methods whereby we could soon get a goodly\r\nsum of money without much trouble. And one of these is, that since we\r\nhave no revenue greater than from the customs levied at the gates of\r\nFlorence, and since we have eleven gates, let us at once have eleven\r\nmore made, and thus we shall double our revenue. The other method is to\r\ngive orders that the mints be forthwith opened in Pistoia and\r\nPrato,[208] just the same as in Florence, and that nothing be done there\r\nday and night but mint money, and that all the money be ducats of gold;\r\nand in my judgment this course is the quicker and the less costly.’”\r\n\r\n53.—There was much laughter at this citizen’s keen sagacity: and the\r\nlaughter being quieted, my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“Messer Bernardo, will you allow messer Pietro to ridicule the\r\nFlorentines in this fashion, without returning blow for blow?”\r\n\r\n“I forgive him this affront,” replied messer Bernardo, still laughing,\r\n“for if he has displeased me by ridiculing the Florentines, he has\r\npleased me by obeying you, as I also would always do.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare said:\r\n\r\n“I heard a delightful blunder made by a Brescian who had been at Venice\r\nthis year for the feast of the Ascension, and in my presence was\r\ndescribing to some of his companions the fine things that he had seen\r\nthere; and how much merchandise there was, and how much silverware,\r\nspices, cloth and stuffs; then the Signory went forth with great pomp to\r\nwed the sea in the Bucentaur,[209] on board of which there were so many\r\nfinely dressed gentlemen, so much music and singing, that it seemed a\r\nparadise. And on being asked by one of his companions which kind of\r\nmusic he liked best among those that he had heard, he said: ‘They all\r\nwere good; but among the rest I saw a man playing on a certain strange\r\ntrumpet, which he thrust down his throat more than two palms at every\r\nflourish, and then he straightway drew it out and thrust it down again;\r\nso that you never saw a greater marvel.’”\r\n\r\nThen everyone laughed, perceiving the silly mistake of the man, who had\r\nimagined that the player thrust down his throat that part of the\r\ntrombone which disappears by sliding into itself.\r\n\r\n54.—Messer Bernardo then continued:\r\n\r\n“Moreover common affectations are tedious, but they excite much laughter\r\nwhen they are beyond measure: like those we sometimes hear from certain\r\nmouths regarding greatness or courage or nobility; or sometimes from\r\nwomen, regarding beauty or fastidiousness. As was not long since the\r\ncase with a lady who remained sad and abstracted at some great festival;\r\nand when asked what she was thinking about that should make her so\r\ngloomy, she replied: ‘I was thinking of a matter that troubles me\r\ngreatly whenever it occurs to me, nor can I lift it from my heart; and\r\nthis is, that on the universal Judgment Day, when all men’s naked bodies\r\nmust rise and appear before the tribunal of Christ, I cannot endure the\r\ndistress I feel at the thought that my body will have to be seen\r\nunclothed among the rest.’ Being extravagant, such affectations as these\r\ncause laughter rather than tedium.\r\n\r\n“You all are familiar with those splendid lies so well composed that\r\nthey move to laughter. A very excellent one was but lately told me by a\r\nfriend of ours who never suffers us to be without them.”\r\n\r\n55.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano said:\r\n\r\n“Be that as it may, it cannot be more excellent or more ingenious than\r\none which a fellow-Tuscan of ours, a merchant of Lucca, affirmed the\r\nother day as a positive fact.”\r\n\r\n“Tell it to us,” added my lady Duchess.\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“This merchant, so he tells the story, once finding himself in Poland,\r\ndecided to buy a quantity of sables with the intention of carrying them\r\ninto Italy and making great profit thereby. And after much effort, being\r\nunable to enter Muscovy himself (by reason of the war that was then\r\nwaging between the King of Poland and the Duke of Muscovy), he arranged\r\nwith the help of some people of the country, that on an appointed day\r\ncertain Muscovite merchants should come with their sables to the\r\nfrontier of Poland, and he promised to be there in order to strike the\r\nbargain. Accordingly, proceeding with his companions towards Muscovy,\r\nthe man of Lucca reached the Dnieper, which he found all frozen as hard\r\nas marble, and saw that the Muscovites (who on account of the war were\r\nthemselves suspicious of the Poles) were already on the other bank, but\r\napproached no nearer than the width of the river. So, having recognized\r\neach other, the Muscovites after some signalling began to speak with a\r\nloud voice, and to ask the price that they wished for their sables; but\r\nsuch was the extreme cold that they were not heard, for before reaching\r\nthe other bank (where the man of Lucca and his interpreters were) the\r\nwords froze in the air, and remained there frozen and caught in such\r\nmanner that the Poles, who knew the custom, set about making a great\r\nfire in the very middle of the river; because to their thinking that was\r\nthe limit reached by the warm voice before it was stopped by freezing,\r\nand the river was quite solid enough to bear the fire easily. So, when\r\nthis was done, the words (which had remained frozen for the space of an\r\nhour) in due course began to melt and to fall in a murmur, like snow\r\nfrom the mountains in May; and thus they were at once heard very well,\r\nalthough the men had already gone. But as the merchant thought that the\r\nwords asked too high a price for the sables, he would not accept the\r\noffer and so returned without them.”[210]\r\n\r\n56.—Thereupon everyone laughed, and messer Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“Of a truth the story I wish to tell you is not so ingenious; however it\r\nis a fine one, and runs as follows:\r\n\r\n“Speaking a few days since of the country or World recently discovered\r\nby the Portuguese mariners,[211] and of the various animals and other\r\nthings which they bring back to Portugal, that friend of whom I told you\r\naffirmed that he had seen a monkey of a form very different from those\r\nwe are accustomed to see, which played chess most admirably. And among\r\nother occasions, the gentleman who had brought her, being one day before\r\nthe King of Portugal[212] and engaged in a game of chess with her, the\r\nmonkey made several moves so skilfully as to press him hard and at last\r\ncheckmated him. Being vexed, as all are wont to be who lose at that\r\ngame, the gentleman took up the king-piece (which was very large, such\r\nas the Portuguese use) and gave the monkey a smart blow upon the head;\r\nwhereupon she leaped aside crying loudly, and seemed to ask justice of\r\nthe king for the wrong that had been done her. Then the gentleman\r\ninvited her to play again; and after refusing awhile by means of signs,\r\nshe finally began to play once more, and, as she had done the first\r\ntime, she again had the better of him. At last, seeing that she would be\r\nable to checkmate the gentleman, the monkey tried a new trick to guard\r\nagainst being struck again; and without showing what she was at, she\r\nquietly put her right paw under the gentleman’s left elbow, which was\r\nluxuriously resting on a taffety[213] cushion, and (quickly snatching\r\nthe cushion) with her left paw she at the same time checkmated him with\r\na pawn, while with her right she held the cushion over her head as a\r\nshield against his blows; she then leaped joyfully to the king as if to\r\nparade her victory. Now you see how wise, wary and discreet the monkey\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“It must be that this was a doctor among monkeys, and of great\r\nauthority; and I think that the Republic of Indian Monkeys sent her to\r\nPortugal to make a name in a foreign land.”\r\n\r\nThereupon everyone laughed, both at the story and at the addition given\r\nto it by messer Cesare.\r\n\r\n57.—So, continuing the discussion, messer Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“You have now heard what occurs to me concerning those pleasantries that\r\nrender the effect of a thing by continuous talk; therefore it is now\r\nwell to speak of those that consist in a single saying and have a quick\r\nkeenness compressed into a phrase or word. And just as in the first\r\nkind,—that of humourous talk,—we must in our narrative and mimicry avoid\r\nresembling buffoons and parasites and those who make others laugh by\r\ntheir sheer absurdities, so in these short sayings the Courtier must\r\ntake care not to appear malicious and spiteful, and not to utter\r\nwitticisms and _arguzie_ solely to annoy and cut to the quick; because\r\nfor the sin of their tongue such men often suffer in all their members.\r\n\r\n58.—“Now of the ready pleasantries that are contained in a short saying,\r\nthose are keenest that arise from ambiguity. Yet they do not always move\r\nto laughter, for they are oftener applauded as ingenious than as comic.\r\nAs was said a few days since by our friend messer Annibal Paleotto[214]\r\nto someone who was recommending a tutor to teach his sons grammar, and\r\nwho, after praising the tutor as very learned, said that by way of\r\nstipend the man desired not only money but a room furnished for living\r\nand sleeping, because he had no _letto_ (bed): whereupon messer Annibal\r\nat once replied: ‘And how can he be learned if he has not _letto_\r\n(read)?’ You see how well he played upon the double meaning of the\r\nphrase, _non aver letto_ [to have no bed, or, not to have read].\r\n\r\n“But while this punning witticism has much sharpness, where a man takes\r\nwords in a sense different from that in which everyone else takes them,\r\nit seems (as I have said) to excite wonderment rather than laughter,\r\nexcept when it is combined with some other kind of saying.\r\n\r\n“Now that kind of witticism which is most used to excite laughter, is\r\nwhen we are prepared to hear one thing and the speaker says another, and\r\nit is called ‘the unexpected.’ And if punning be combined with this, the\r\nwitticism becomes most spicy: as the other day, when there was a\r\ndiscussion about making a fine brick floor (_un bel mattonato_) for my\r\nlady Duchess’s closet, after much talk you, Giancristoforo, said: ‘If we\r\ncould fetch the Bishop of Potenza[215] and flatten him out well, it\r\nwould be the very thing, for he is the craziest creature born (_il più\r\nbel matto nato_).’ Everyone laughed heartily, for by dividing the word\r\n_matto-nato_ you made the pun. Moreover saying that it would be well to\r\nflatten out a bishop and lay him in the floor of a room, was unexpected\r\nto the listener; and so the sally was very keen and laughable.\r\n\r\n59.—“But of punning witticisms there are many kinds; therefore we must\r\nbe careful and play very lightly with our words, and avoid those that\r\nmake the sally flat or that seem forced; and also those (as we have\r\nsaid) that are too biting. As where several companions found themselves\r\nat the house of one of their friends who was blind of one eye, and the\r\nblind man bade the company stay to dinner, all took their leave save\r\none, who said: ‘I will stay with you because I see you have a vacant\r\nplace for one;’ and at the same time he pointed with his finger to the\r\nempty socket. You see this is too bitter and rude, for it wounded\r\nwithout cause, and the speaker had not first been stung himself.\r\nMoreover he said that which might be said of all blind men; and such\r\nuniversal things give no pleasure, because it seems possible that they\r\nmay have been thought out beforehand. And of this kind was that gibe at\r\na man without nose: ‘And where do you hang your spectacles?’[216] or\r\n‘With what do you smell the roses in their season?’\r\n\r\n60.—“But among other witticisms those have very good grace that are made\r\nby taking the very words and sense from another man’s taunt and turning\r\nthem against him and striking him with his own weapons; as where a\r\nlitigant—whose adversary had said to him in the judge’s presence: ‘Why\r\ndo you bark so?’—at once replied: ‘Because I see a thief.’\r\n\r\n“And another instance of this was when Galeotto da Narni,[217] on his\r\nway through Siena, stopped in the street to ask for the inn; and a\r\nSienese, seeing how fat he was, said, laughing: ‘Other men carry their\r\nwallets behind, but this one carries his in front.’ Galeotto at once\r\nreplied: ‘That is the way we do in a land of thieves.’\r\n\r\n61.—“There is still another kind, which we call playing on words,[218]\r\nand this consists in changing a word by either adding or omitting a\r\nletter or a syllable; as when someone said: ‘You are better versed in\r\nthe Lat_r_in tongue than in the Greek.’ And you, my Lady, had a letter\r\naddressed to you, ‘To my lady Emilia _Im_pia.’[219]\r\n\r\n“Moreover it is a pleasant thing to quote a verse or two, applying it to\r\na purpose different from that which the author intends, or some other\r\nfamiliar saw; sometimes to the same purpose, but changing some word. As\r\nwhen a gentleman, who had an ugly and disagreeable wife, was asked how\r\nhe was, he replied: ‘Judge yourself of my state, when _Furiarum maxima\r\njuxta me cubat_.’[220] And messer Geronimo Donato,[221] while going the\r\nrounds of the _Stazioni_[222] at Rome in Lent with several other\r\ngentlemen, met a bevy of beautiful Roman ladies; and one of the\r\ngentlemen saying: ‘_Quot coelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma\r\npuellas_,’[223] he at once replied: _Pascua quotque haedos, tot habet\r\ntua Roma cinaedos_,[224] pointing to a company of young men who were\r\ncoming from the other direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GALEOTTO MARZI DA NARNI\r\n  1427?-1490?\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a cast, kindly furnished by M. Pierre Valton, of an\r\n    anonymous medal in his collection at Paris. See Armand’s _Les\r\n    Médailleurs Italiens_, ii, 35, no. 25.\r\n\r\n“In like fashion messer Marcantonio della Torre[225] addressed the\r\nBishop of Padua. There being a nunnery at Padua in charge of a friar\r\nreputed to be of very pure life and learned as well, it came to pass\r\nthat, as the friar frequented the convent familiarly and often confessed\r\nthe nuns, five of them (more than half of all there were) became\r\npregnant; and the affair being discovered, the friar wished to flee but\r\nknew not how. The bishop had him taken into custody, and he soon\r\nconfessed that he had brought the five nuns to this pass, being tempted\r\nof the devil; wherefore the bishop was firmly resolved to punish him\r\nroundly. But as the man was learned, he had many friends who all tried\r\nto help him, and along with the rest messer Marcantonio went to the\r\nbishop to implore some measure of pardon for him. The bishop would in no\r\nwise listen to them; and after they had pleaded hard, and recommended\r\nthe culprit, and urged in excuse the opportunities of his position, the\r\nfrailty of human nature, and many other things,—at last the bishop said:\r\n‘I will do nothing for him, because I shall have to render God an\r\naccount of the matter.’ And when they repeated their arguments, the\r\nbishop said: ‘What answer shall I make to God on the Day of Judgment,\r\nwhen he says to me, _Give an account of thy stewardship_?’[226] Then\r\nmesser Marcantonio at once said: ‘My Lord, say that which the Evangelist\r\nsays: _Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold I have gained\r\nbesides them five talents more_.’[227] Whereupon the bishop could not\r\nkeep from laughing, and greatly softened his anger and the punishment\r\nintended for the offender.\r\n\r\n62.—“It is also amusing to interpret names, and to pretend some reason\r\nwhy the man who is spoken of bears such a name, or why something is\r\ndone. As a few days ago, when Proto da Lucca[228] (who is very amusing,\r\nas you know) asked for the bishopric of Caglio, the Pope replied:\r\n‘Knowest thou not that in the Spanish tongue _caglio_ means _I keep\r\nsilence_? And thou art a babbler; wherefore it would be unseemly for a\r\nbishop never to be able to repeat his title without telling an untruth.\r\nSo be thou silent (_caglia_) now.’ Here Proto made a reply, which,\r\nalthough it was not of this sort, yet was not less to the point; for\r\nhaving several times repeated his request, and seeing that it was of no\r\navail, at last he said: ‘Holy Father, if your Holiness grant me this\r\nbishopric, it will not be without advantage, for I shall leave your\r\nHoliness two offices (_ufficii_).’ ‘And what offices have you to leave?’\r\nsaid the Pope. Proto replied: ‘The full office (_ufficio grande_), and\r\nthe Madonna’s office (_ufficio della Madonna_).’[229] Then the Pope\r\ncould not keep from laughing, although he was a very grave man.\r\n\r\n“Still another man at Padua said that Calfurnio[230] was so named\r\nbecause he was accustomed to heat (_s_cal_dare_) ovens (_forni_). And\r\nwhen I one day asked Fedra[231] why it was that on Good Friday, while\r\nthe Church offered prayer not only for Christians but even for pagans\r\nand Jews, no mention is made of cardinals along with bishops and other\r\nprelates,—he answered me that cardinals were included in that prayer\r\nwhich says: ‘Let us pray for heretics and schismatics.’\r\n\r\n“And our friend Count Ludovico said that the reason why I censured a\r\nlady for using a certain cosmetic that gave a high polish, was because I\r\nsaw myself in her face, when it was painted, as in a mirrour; and being\r\nill favoured I could have no wish to see myself.\r\n\r\n“Of this kind was that retort of messer Camillo Paleotto[232] to messer\r\nAntonio Porcaro,[233] who, in speaking of a companion who told the\r\npriest at confession that he fasted zealously, attended mass and the\r\nsacred offices, and did all the good in the world, said: ‘The man\r\npraises himself instead of owning his sins;’ to which messer Camillo\r\nreplied: ‘Nay, he confesses these things because he thinks it a great\r\nsin to do them.’\r\n\r\n“Do you not remember what a good thing my lord Prefect said the other\r\nday? When Giantommaso Galeotto[234] was surprised at a man’s asking two\r\nhundred ducats for a horse, because, as Giantommaso said, it was not\r\nworth a farthing and among other defects was so afraid of weapons that\r\nno one could make it come near them,—my lord Prefect (wishing to twit\r\nthe man with cowardice) said: ‘If the horse has this trick of running\r\naway from weapons, I wonder that he does not ask a thousand ducats for\r\nit.’\r\n\r\n63.—“Moreover the very same word is sometimes employed, but in a sense\r\ndifferent from the usual one. As when my lord Duke,[2] being about to\r\ncross a very rapid river, said to a trumpeter: ‘Cross over’ (_passa_);\r\nand the trumpeter turned cap in hand, and said respectfully: ‘After your\r\nLordship’ (_passi la Signoria Vostra_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TOMMASO INGHIRAMI\r\n  “FEDRA”\r\n  1470?-1516\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 42.171) of the portrait, in the\r\n    Pitti Gallery at Florence, long attributed to Raphael (1483-1520),\r\n    but pronounced by Morelli to be a copy, by a non-Italian painter, of\r\n    the original Raphael owned by the Inghirami family at Volterra and\r\n    now ruined by restoration.\r\n\r\n“Another amusing kind of banter is where a man takes the speaker’s words\r\nbut not his sense. As was the case this year when a German at Rome,\r\nmeeting one evening with our friend messer Filippo Beroaldo,[235] whose\r\npupil he was, said: _Domine magister, Deus det vobis bonum sero_;[236]\r\nand Beroaldo at once replied: _Tibi malum cito_.[237]\r\n\r\n“Again, Diego de Chignones[238] being at the Great Captain’s[239] table,\r\nanother Spaniard, who was eating with them, said: ‘_Vino_,‘ meaning to\r\nask for drink; Diego replied: ’_Y no lo conocistes_,’[240] meaning to\r\ntaunt the man with being a heretic.[241]\r\n\r\n“Another time messer Giacomo Sadoleto[242] asked Beroaldo,[235] who was\r\nsaying how much he wished to go to Bologna: ‘What is it that so presses\r\nyou at this time to leave Rome, where there are so many pleasures, to go\r\nto Bologna, which is full of turmoil?’ Beroaldo replied: ‘On three\r\ncounts I am forced to go to Bologna,’ and lifted three fingers of his\r\nleft hand to enumerate three reasons for his going; when messer Giacomo\r\nquickly interrupted him and said: ‘These three Counts that make you go\r\nto Bologna are: first, Count Ludovico da San Bonifacio; second, Count\r\nErcole Rangone; third, the Count of Pepoli.’ Whereupon everyone laughed,\r\nbecause these three Counts had been pupils of Beroaldo, and were fine\r\nyouths studying at Bologna.[243]\r\n\r\n“Now we laugh heartily at this kind of witticism, because it carries\r\nwith it a response different from the one we are expecting to hear, and\r\nin such matters we are naturally amused by our very mistake and laugh to\r\nfind ourselves cheated of what we expect.\r\n\r\n64.—“But the modes of speech and the figures that are graceful in grave\r\nand serious talk, are nearly always becoming in pleasantries and games\r\nas well. You see that words set in opposition produce much grace, when\r\none contrasting clause is balanced by another. The same method is often\r\nvery witty. Thus a Genoese, who was very prodigal in spending, was\r\nreproached by a very miserly usurer, who said to him: ‘When will you\r\never cease throwing away your riches?’ And he replied: ‘When you cease\r\nstealing other men’s.’\r\n\r\n“And since, as we have said, the same situations that give opportunity\r\nfor biting pleasantries may also give opportunity for serious words of\r\npraise,—it is a very graceful and becoming method in either case for a\r\nman to admit or confirm what another speaker says, but to interpret it\r\nin a manner different from what was intended. Thus a village priest was\r\nsaying mass to his flock not long since, and after he had announced the\r\nfestivals of the week, he began the general confession in the people’s\r\nname, saying: ‘I have sinned by doing evil, by saying evil, by thinking\r\nevil,’ and so forth, making mention of all the deadly sins. Whereupon a\r\nfriend and close familiar of the priest, in order to make sport of him,\r\nsaid to the bystanders: ‘Bear witness all of you to what by his own\r\nmouth he confesses he has done, for I mean to report him to the bishop.’\r\n\r\n“This same method was used by Sallaza dalla Pedrada[244] in\r\ncomplimenting a lady with whom he was speaking. First he praised her for\r\nher virtuous qualities and then for still being beautiful; and she\r\nreplying that she did not deserve such praise because she was already\r\nold, he said to her: ‘My Lady, your only sign of age is your resemblance\r\nto the angels, who were the first and oldest creatures that God ever\r\nmade.’\r\n\r\n65.—“Just as serious sayings are useful for praising, in like fashion we\r\nfind great utility also in jocose sayings for taunting, and in well\r\narranged metaphors, especially if they take the form of repartee, and if\r\nhe who replies preserves the same metaphor used by his interlocutor. And\r\nof this kind was the answer made to messer Palla degli Strozzi,[245] who\r\nbeing exiled from Florence, sent back a servant on a certain matter of\r\nbusiness and said to him rather threateningly: ‘Thou wilt tell Cosimo\r\nde’ Medici from me that the hen is hatching.’[246] The messenger did the\r\nerrand commanded him, and Cosimo at once replied without hesitation:\r\n‘And thou wilt tell messer Palla from me that hens cannot hatch well\r\naway from their nests.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DJEM OTHMAN\r\n  1459-1495\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from Anderson’s photograph (no. 4268) of a part of the fresco,\r\n    “The Dispute of St. Catherine,” in the Borgian Apartments in the\r\n    Vatican, by Bernardino di Betto di Biagio, better known as\r\n    Pinturicchio, (1454-1513). For the iconographical identification of\r\n    this head, the translator is indebted to Professor Adolfo Venturi.\r\n\r\n“Again, with a metaphor messer Camillo Porcaro[247] gracefully praised\r\nmy lord Marcantonio Colonna;[248] who, having heard that messer Camillo\r\nhad been extolling in an oration certain Italian gentlemen famous as\r\nwarriors, and had spoken very highly of him among the rest, he expressed\r\nhis thanks and said: ‘Messer Camillo, you have treated your friends as\r\nsome merchants treat their money when it is found to contain a false\r\nducat; for in order to be rid of it, they put the piece among many good\r\nones, and in this way pass it on. So you, to do me honour (although I am\r\nof little worth), have put me in company with such worthy and excellent\r\ncavaliers, that by virtue of their merit I shall perhaps pass as good.’\r\nThen messer Camillo replied: ‘Those who forge ducats are wont to gild\r\nthem so well that they seem to the eye much finer than the good ones;\r\nso, if there were forgers of men as there are of ducats, we should have\r\nreason to suspect that you were false, being as you are of far finer and\r\nbrighter metal than any of the rest.’\r\n\r\n“You see that this situation gave opportunity for both kinds of\r\nwitticism; and so do many others, of which countless instances could be\r\ngiven and especially in serious sayings. Like the one uttered by the\r\nGreat Captain, who, being seated at table and all the places being\r\nalready taken, saw that there remained standing two Italian cavaliers\r\nwho had served very gallantly in the war; and he at once rose himself\r\nand caused all the others to rise and make room for these two, saying:\r\n‘Allow these cavaliers to sit at their meat, for had it not been for\r\nthem, the rest of us should now have no meat to eat.’ Another time he\r\nsaid to Diego Garzia,[249] who was urging him to retire from a dangerous\r\nposition where the cannon shot were falling: ‘Since God hath put no fear\r\nin your heart, do not try to put any in mine.’\r\n\r\n“And King Louis,[250] who is to-day king of France, being told soon\r\nafter his accession that then was the time to punish his enemies who had\r\nso grievously wronged him while he was Duke of Orleans, replied that it\r\nwas not seemly for the King of France to avenge the wrongs of the Duke\r\nof Orleans.\r\n\r\n66.—“Taunts are also often humourously uttered with a grave air and\r\nwithout exciting laughter. As when Djem Othman,[251] brother to the\r\nGrand Turk,[252] being a captive at Rome, said that jousting as we\r\npractise it in Italy seemed to him too great a matter for play and too\r\npaltry for earnest. And on being told how agile and active King\r\nFerdinand the Younger was in running, leaping, vaulting, and the\r\nlike,—he said that in his country slaves practised these exercises,\r\nwhile gentlemen studied the liberal arts from boyhood, and prided\r\nthemselves thereon.\r\n\r\n“Almost of the same kind, too, but somewhat more laughable, was what the\r\nArchbishop of Florence said to the Alexandrian cardinal:[253] that men\r\nhave only their goods, their body, and their soul; their goods are put\r\nin peril by the lawyers, their body by the physicians, and their soul by\r\nthe theologians.”\r\n\r\nThen the Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“To this you might add what Nicoletto[254] said: that we seldom find a\r\nlawyer who goes to law, a physician who takes physic, or a theologian\r\nwho is a good Christian.”\r\n\r\n67.—Messer Bernardo laughed, then went on:\r\n\r\n“Of these there are countless instances, uttered by great lords and very\r\nweighty men. But we often laugh at similes also, such as the one that\r\nour friend Pistoia[255] wrote to Serafino: ‘Send back the wallet that\r\nlooks like you;’ because, if you remember rightly, Serafino looked very\r\nlike a wallet.\r\n\r\n“Moreover there are some who delight to liken men and women to horses,\r\ndogs, birds, and often to chests, stools, carts, candle-sticks; which is\r\nsometimes good and sometimes very flat. Therefore in this it is needful\r\nto consider time, place, persons, and the other things that we have\r\nmentioned so many times.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“An amusing comparison was the one that our friend my lord Giovanni\r\nGonzaga[256] made between Alexander the Great and his own son\r\nAlessandro.”[257]\r\n\r\n“I do not know it,” replied messer Bernardo.\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Giovanni was playing with three dice, and as was his wont had\r\nlost many ducats and was still losing; and his son my lord Alessandro\r\n(who, although only a lad, is as fond of play as the father is) stood\r\nlooking at him with great attention and seemed very sad. Count\r\nPianella,[258] who was present with many other gentlemen, said: ‘You\r\nsee, my Lord, that my lord Alessandro is little pleased at your losing,\r\nand is waiting anxiously for you to win so that he may have some of your\r\nwinnings. Therefore put him out of his misery, and before you lose\r\neverything give him at least a ducat, in order that he too may go and\r\nplay with his fellows.’ Then my lord Giovanni said: ‘You are wrong, for\r\nAlessandro is not thinking of any such trifle. But as it is written that\r\nwhen he was a boy, Alexander the Great began to weep on hearing that his\r\nfather Philip[259] had won a great battle and subdued some kingdom, and\r\nwhen he was asked why he wept, he replied that it was because he feared\r\nhis father would subdue so many lands as to leave nothing for him to\r\nsubdue; in the same way my son Alessandro is now grieving and about to\r\nweep, seeing that I his father am losing, because he fears I am losing\r\nso much that I shall leave nothing for him to lose.’”\r\n\r\n68.—After some laughter at this, messer Bernardo continued:\r\n\r\n“Moreover we must avoid impiety in our witticism, (because from this it\r\nis only a step to try to be jocular by blaspheming and to invent new\r\nforms of blasphemy); otherwise we seem to seek applause by that for\r\nwhich we deserve not only blame but heavy punishment, which is an\r\nabominable thing. And therefore those of us who like to show their\r\npleasantry by little reverence to God, deserve to be chased from the\r\nsociety of every gentleman.\r\n\r\n“And they, no less, who are indecent and foul of speech, and show no\r\nrespect for ladies’ presence and seem to have no other pleasure than to\r\nmake them blush with shame, and who to that end are continually seeking\r\nwitticisms and _arguzie_. As in Ferrara this year at a banquet attended\r\nby many ladies, there were a Florentine and a Sienese, who are usually\r\nhostile, as you know. To taunt the Florentine, the Sienese said: ‘We\r\nhave married Siena to the Emperor and have given him Florence for\r\ndowry.’ He said this because it was reported at the time that the\r\nSienese had given the Emperor a certain sum of money and that he had\r\ntaken their city under his protection. The Florentine quickly retorted:\r\n‘Siena will first be possessed’ (he used the Italian word, but with the\r\nFrench meaning); ‘then the dowry will be disputed at leisure.’[260] You\r\nsee that the retort was clever, but, being made in the presence of\r\nladies, it became indecent and unseemly.”\r\n\r\n69.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:\r\n\r\n“Women delight to hear nothing else; and you would deprive them of it.\r\nMoreover for my part I have found myself blushing with shame at words\r\nuttered by women far oftener than by men.”\r\n\r\n“Of such women I was not speaking,” said messer Bernardo; “but of\r\nvirtuous ladies, who deserve reverence and honour from every gentleman.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“We should have to invent a subtle rule by which to distinguish them,\r\nfor most often those who are seemingly the best, in fact are quite the\r\ncontrary.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“If we had not present here my lord Magnifico, who is everywhere\r\naccounted the champion of women, I should undertake to answer you; but I\r\nam unwilling to do him wrong.”\r\n\r\nHere my lady Emilia said, also laughing:\r\n\r\n“Women have need of no champion against an accuser of so little weight.\r\nSo leave my lord Gaspar in his perverse opinion,—which arises from his\r\nnever having found a lady to look at him, rather than from any fault on\r\ntheir part,—and go on with your talk about pleasantries.”\r\n\r\n70.—Then messer Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“In truth, my Lady, methinks I have told of many situations from which\r\nwe can derive sharp witticisms, which then have the more grace the more\r\nthey are accompanied by fine narrative. Still many others might be\r\nmentioned. As when, by overstatement or understatement, we say things\r\nthat outrageously exceed the probable; and of this sort was what Mario\r\nda Volterra[261] said of a prelate, that he held himself so great a man\r\nthat when he entered St. Peter’s, he stooped in order not to strike his\r\nhead against the architrave of the portal. Again, our friend here the\r\nMagnifico said that his servant Galpino was so lean and light that in\r\nblowing the fire to kindle it one morning, the fellow had been carried\r\nby the smoke all the way up the chimney to the very top; but happening\r\nto be brought crosswise against one of the openings, he had the good\r\nluck not to be blown away with the smoke.\r\n\r\n“Another time messer Agostino Bevazzano[262] said that a miser, who had\r\nbeen unwilling to sell his grain while it was dear, afterwards hanged\r\nhimself in despair from a rafter of his bedroom when he found that the\r\nprice had greatly fallen; and one of his servants ran in on hearing the\r\nnoise, saw the miser hanging, and quickly cut the rope and thus rescued\r\nhim from death. Then, having come to himself, the miser insisted that\r\nhis servant should pay him for the rope that had been cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AGOSTINO BEVAZZANO\r\n  _Flor._ 1500\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 43.161) of a part of the double\r\n    portrait once owned by Bembo and now in the Doria Gallery at Rome.\r\n    Although by some critics regarded as an old copy, the picture is\r\n    affirmed by both Morelli and Berenson to be the work of Raphael\r\n    (1483-1520), probably painted in April 1516.\r\n\r\n“Of the same sort also seems to be what Lorenzo de’ Medici said to a\r\ndull buffoon: ‘You would not make me laugh if you tickled me.’ And in\r\nlike fashion he answered another simpleton who had found him abed very\r\nlate one morning, and who had reproved him for sleeping so late, saying:\r\n‘I have already been at the New Market and the Old, then outside the San\r\nGallo gate and around the walls for exercise, and have done a thousand\r\nthings besides; and you are still asleep?’ Then Lorenzo said: ‘What I\r\ndreamed in one hour is worth more than what you accomplished in four.’\r\n\r\n71.—“It is also fine when in a retort we censure something without\r\napparently meaning to censure it. For instance, the Marquess Federico of\r\nMantua,[263] father to our lady Duchess, being at table with many\r\ngentlemen, one of them said after eating an entire bowl of stew: ‘Pardon\r\nme, my lord Marquess;’ and so saying he began to gulp down the broth\r\nthat remained. Then the Marquess said quickly: ‘Ask pardon rather of the\r\nswine, for you do me no wrong at all.’\r\n\r\n“Again, to censure a tyrant who was falsely reputed to be generous,\r\nmesser Niccolò Leonico[264] said: ‘Think what generosity rules him, for\r\nhe gives away not his own things only, but other men’s as well!’\r\n\r\n72.—“Another very pretty form of pleasantry is that which consists in a\r\nkind of innuendo, when we say one thing and tacitly imply another. Of\r\ncourse I do not mean another thing of a completely different kind, like\r\ncalling a dwarf gigantic and a negro white or a very ugly man handsome,\r\nfor the difference is too obvious,—although even these sometimes cause\r\nlaughter; but I mean when with stern and serious air we humourously say\r\nsomething in jest which is not our real thought. For instance, when a\r\ngentleman told a palpable lie to messer Agostino Foglietta[265] and\r\naffirmed it stoutly on seeing that he had much difficulty in believing\r\nit, messer Agostino said at last: ‘Fair sir, if I may ever hope to\r\nreceive kindness from you, do me the favour to be content even if I do\r\nnot believe anything you say.’ But as the other repeated, and under\r\noath, that it was the truth, he finally said: ‘Since you will have it\r\nso, I will believe it for your sake, for indeed I would do even a\r\ngreater thing than this for you.’\r\n\r\n“Don Giovanni di Cardona[266] said something nearly of this sort about a\r\nman who wished to leave Rome: ‘To my thinking the fellow is ill advised,\r\nfor he is so great a rascal that by staying on at Rome he might in time\r\nbecome a cardinal.’ Of this sort also is what was said by Alfonso\r\nSantacroce,[267] who had shortly before suffered some outrage from the\r\nCardinal of Pavia.[268] While strolling with several gentlemen near the\r\nplace of public execution outside Bologna, he saw a man who had recently\r\nbeen hanged, and turning towards the body with a thoughtful air, he said\r\nloud enough for everyone to hear him: ‘Happy thou, who hast naught to do\r\nwith the Cardinal of Pavia.’\r\n\r\n73.—“And this sort of pleasantry which is tinged with irony seems very\r\nbecoming to great men, because it is dignified and sharp, and can be\r\nused in jocose as well as in serious matters. Hence many ancients (and\r\nthose among the most esteemed) have used it, like Cato and Scipio\r\nAfricanus the Younger; but above all men, the philosopher Socrates is\r\nsaid to have excelled in it. And in our own times King Alfonso I of\r\nAragon,[269] who, being about to eat one morning, took off the many\r\nprecious rings that he had on his fingers, in order not to wet them in\r\nwashing his hands, and so gave them to the first person he happened on,\r\nalmost without looking to see who it was. This servant supposed that the\r\nking had taken no notice who received them, and by reason of weightier\r\ncares would easily forget them altogether; and in this he was the more\r\nconfirmed, seeing that the king did not ask for them again; and as he\r\nsaw days, weeks and months pass without hearing a word about them, he\r\nthought he was surely safe. Accordingly, nearly a year after this had\r\nhappened, he presented himself again one morning as the king was about\r\nto eat, and held out his hand to receive the rings; whereupon the king\r\nbent close to his ear and said to him: ‘Let the first ones suffice thee,\r\nbecause these will do for someone else.’ You see how biting, clever and\r\ndignified the sally was, and how truly worthy the exalted spirit of an\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OTTAVIANO UBALDINI\r\n  Died 1498\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from Braun’s photograph (no. 19.553) of the painting,\r\n    “Astronomy,” by Melozzo degli Ambrosi da Forli (1438-1494). The\r\n    picture, of which this head is a detail, was one of a series of\r\n    panels painted to decorate Duke Federico di Montefeltro’s library in\r\n    the palace of Urbino, but is now in the Royal Museum at Berlin. For\r\n    iconographical identification, see Schmarzow’s _Melozzo da Forli,\r\n    ein Beitrag zur Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte Italiens im XV\r\n    Jahrhundert_ (Berlin: 1886), p. 84.\r\n\r\n74.—“Similar to this manner (which savours of the ironical) is another\r\nmethod, that of describing an evil thing in polite terms. As the Great\r\nCaptain said to one of his cavaliers, who, after the battle of\r\nCerignola,[270] when the danger was over, came forward in the richest\r\narmour possible to describe, accoutered as if for battle. And then the\r\nGreat Captain turned to Don Ugo di Cardona[271] and said: ‘Have no more\r\nfear of storm, for Saint Elmo has appeared;’ and with this polite speech\r\nhe stung the man to the quick, because you know that Saint Elmo[272]\r\nalways appears to mariners after the tempest and gives token of fair\r\nweather; and thus the Great Captain meant that this cavalier’s\r\nappearance was a token that the danger was quite passed.\r\n\r\n“Another time my lord Ottaviano Ubaldini,[273] being at Florence in the\r\ncompany of some citizens of great influence, and the talk being about\r\nsoldiers, one of them asked him if he knew Antonello da Forli,[274] who\r\nhad at that time fled from Florentine territory. My lord Ottaviano\r\nreplied: ‘I do not know him, but have always heard him spoken of as a\r\nprompt soldier.’ Whereupon another Florentine said: ‘You see how prompt\r\nhe is, when he takes his departure without asking leave.’\r\n\r\n75.—“Those witticisms also are very clever in which we take from our\r\ninterlocutor’s lips something that he does not mean. And of this kind,\r\nmethinks, was my lord Duke’s reply to the castellan who lost San\r\nLeo[275] when this duchy was taken by Pope Alexander and given to Duke\r\nValentino;[276] and it was this: my lord Duke being in Venice at the\r\ntime I have mentioned, many of his subjects came continually to give him\r\nsecret news how things were faring in his state; and among the rest came\r\nthis castellan, who, after having excused himself as best he could,\r\nascribing the blame to mischance, said: ‘Have no anxiety, my Lord,\r\nbecause I still have heart to take measures for the recovery of San\r\nLeo.’ Then my lord Duke replied: ‘Trouble yourself no more about the\r\nmatter, for the mere loss of it was a measure that rendered its recovery\r\npossible.’\r\n\r\n“There are certain other sayings when a man known to be clever says\r\nsomething that seems to proceed from foolishness. For instance, messer\r\nCamillo Paleotto[232] said of someone the other day: ‘He was such a fool\r\nthat he died as soon as he began to grow rich.’\r\n\r\n“Of like kind with this is a spicy and keen dissimulation, where a man\r\n(discreet, as I have said) pretends not to understand something that he\r\ndoes understand. Like what was said by the Marquess Federico of Mantua,\r\nwho,—being pestered by a tiresome fellow who complained that some of his\r\nneighbours were snaring doves out of his dovecote, and all the while\r\nheld one of them in his hand, hanging dead just as he had found it with\r\nits foot caught in the snare,—replied that the matter should be looked\r\nto. The fellow repeated the story of his loss not once only but many\r\ntimes, always displaying the dove that had been hanged, and saying: ‘And\r\nwhat, my Lord, do you think ought to be done in this case?’ At last the\r\nMarquess said: ‘I think the dove ought on no account to be buried in\r\nchurch, for having hanged itself, it must be believed to have committed\r\nsuicide.’[277]\r\n\r\n“Somewhat of the same fashion was the retort made by Scipio Nasica[278]\r\nto Ennius. Once when Scipio went to Ennius’s house to speak with him and\r\ncalled him down from the street, one of his maids replied that he was\r\nnot at home; and Scipio distinctly heard Ennius himself tell the maid to\r\nsay he was not at home, and so went away. Not long afterwards Ennius\r\ncame to Scipio’s house and likewise called to him from below; whereupon\r\nScipio himself replied in a loud voice that he was not at home. Then\r\nEnnius replied: ‘How? Do I not know thy voice?’ Scipio said: ‘Thou art\r\ntoo rude. The other day I believed thy maid when she said thou wert not\r\nat home, and now thou wilt not believe the like from me in person.’\r\n\r\n76.—“It is also a fine thing when a man is struck in the very same place\r\nwhere he first struck his fellow. As in the case of messer Alonso\r\nCarillo,[279] who, being at the Spanish court and having committed some\r\nyouthful peccadilloes of no great importance, was put in prison by the\r\nking’s order and left there overnight. The next day he was taken out,\r\nand so going to the palace in the morning, he reached the hall where\r\nthere were many cavaliers and ladies. And as they were laughing at his\r\nimprisonment, my lady Boadilla[280] said: ‘Signor Alonso, your mishap\r\nweighed on me heavily, for all your acquaintance thought the king would\r\nhave you hanged.’ Then Alonso said quickly: ‘My Lady, I was much afraid\r\nof it myself; but then I had hope that you would ask me to be your\r\nhusband.’ You see how sharp and clever this was, because in Spain (as in\r\nmany other countries too) the custom is that when a man is led to the\r\ngallows, his life is given him if a public courtesan begs him for her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RAPHAEL\r\n  1483-1520\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a part of Weinwurm’s photograph (no. 1384) of the\r\n    portrait, in the National Gallery at Buda-Pest, by Sebastiano\r\n    Luciani “del Piombo” (1485-1547). In the Scarpia collection at La\r\n    Motta di Livenza, this picture passed for years as a portrait by\r\n    Raphael of the Ferrarese courtier-poet Antonio Tebaldeo. On purely\r\n    intrinsic evidence, both Morelli and Berenson identify it as a\r\n    portrait of Raphael at the age of 26 or 27 years.\r\n\r\n“In this manner also the painter Raphael replied to two cardinals with\r\nwhom he was on familiar terms, and who (to make him talk) were finding\r\nfault in his presence with a picture that he had painted,—in which St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul were represented,—saying that these two figures were\r\ntoo red in the face. Then Raphael at once said: ‘My Lords, be not\r\nconcerned; because I painted them so with full intention, since we have\r\nreason to believe that St. Peter and St. Paul are as red in Heaven as\r\nyou see them here, for shame that their Church should be governed by\r\nsuch men as you.’[281]\r\n\r\n77.—“Very keen also are those witticisms that have a certain latent\r\nspice of fun in them. As where a husband was making great lament and\r\nweeping for his wife, who had hanged herself on a fig-tree, another man\r\napproached him and plucking him by the robe, said: ‘Brother, might I as\r\na great favour have a small branch of that fig-tree to graft upon some\r\ntree in my garden?’\r\n\r\n“Some other witticisms need an air of patience and are slowly uttered\r\nwith a certain gravity. As where a rustic, who was carrying a box on his\r\nshoulders, jostled it against Cato, and then said: ‘Have a care.’ Cato\r\nreplied: ‘Hast thou aught else but that chest upon thy shoulders?’[282]\r\n\r\n“Moreover we laugh when a man has made a blunder, and to mend it says\r\nsomething of set purpose that seems silly and yet tends to the object he\r\nhas in view, and thus keeps himself in countenance. For instance, in the\r\nFlorentine Council not long ago there were (as often happens in these\r\nrepublics) two enemies, and one of them, who was of the Altoviti family,\r\nfell asleep. And although his adversary, who was of the Alamanni family,\r\nwas not speaking and had not spoken, yet to raise a laugh the man who\r\nsat next Altoviti woke him with a touch of the elbow, and said: ‘Do you\r\nnot hear what So and So says? Make answer, as the Signors are asking for\r\nyour opinion.’ Thereupon Altoviti rose to his feet all drowsy as he was,\r\nand said without stopping to think: ‘My Lords, I say just the opposite\r\nof what Alamanni said.’ Alamanni replied: ‘But I said nothing.’ ‘Then,’\r\nsaid Altoviti at once, ‘the opposite of whatever you may say.’\r\n\r\n“Of this kind also was what your Urbino physician, master Serafino, said\r\nto a rustic, who had received a hard blow in the eye so that it was\r\nforced quite out, yet decided to seek aid from master Serafino. On\r\nseeing him, although aware that it was impossible to cure him, still in\r\norder to force money from his hands (just as the blow had forced the eye\r\nfrom his head), the doctor readily promised to cure him, and accordingly\r\ndemanded money from him every day, affirming that he would begin to\r\nrecover his sight within five or six days. The poor rustic gave what\r\nlittle he had; then, seeing that the affair was progressing slowly, he\r\nbegan to complain of the physician, and to say that he felt no benefit\r\nat all and saw no more with that eye than as if he had it not in his\r\nhead. At last master Serafino, seeing that he would be able to extort\r\nlittle more from the man, said: ‘Brother, you must have patience. You\r\nhave lost your eye and there is no longer any help for it; and may God\r\ngrant that you do not lose your other eye as well.’ On hearing this, the\r\nrustic began to weep and complain loudly, and said: ‘Master, you have\r\nruined me and stolen my money. I will complain to my lord Duke;’ and he\r\nmade the greatest outcry in the world. Then, to clear himself, master\r\nSerafino said angrily: ‘Ah, wretched traitor! So you would have two\r\neyes, as city-folk and rich men have? To perdition with you!’ and\r\naccompanied these words with such fury that the poor rustic was\r\nfrightened into silence and quietly went his way in peace, believing\r\nhimself to be in the wrong.\r\n\r\n78.—“It is also fine to explain or interpret a thing jocosely. As when\r\nat the court of Spain there appeared one morning in the palace a\r\ncavalier who was very ugly, and his wife who was very beautiful, both\r\ndressed in white damask (_damasco_),—the queen[283] said to Alonso\r\nCarillo: ‘What think you of these two, Alonso?’ ‘My Lady,’ replied\r\nAlonso, ‘I think she is the _dama_ (lady), and he is the _asco_,’ which\r\nmeans monster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANCESCO ALIDOSI\r\n  CARDINAL OF PAVIA\r\n  Died 1511\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Giraudon’s photograph (no. 1528) of an anonymous bas-relief\r\n    in the Louvre. The features strikingly resemble those of Francesco\r\n    Francia’s medal of Alidosi, but are very unlike those shown in a\r\n    picture by Raphael (in the Prado Gallery at Madrid), which M. Müntz\r\n    regards as a portrait of the same personage. See _L’Archivio Storico\r\n    dell’Arte_ for 1891, pp. 328-32.\r\n\r\n“Another time Rafaello de’ Pazzi[284] saw a letter which the Prior of\r\nMessina[285] had written to a lady of his acquaintance, the\r\nsuperscription of which read, ‘This missive is to be delivered to the\r\nauthor of my woes.’ ‘Methinks,’ said Rafaello, ‘this letter is intended\r\nfor Paolo Tolosa.’[286] Imagine how the bystanders laughed, when\r\neveryone knew that Paolo Tolosa had lent the Prior ten thousand ducats,\r\nand that he, being a great spendthrift, found no means to repay them.\r\n\r\n“Akin to this is the giving of friendly admonition in the form of\r\nadvice, yet covertly. As Cosimo de’ Medici did to one of his friends,\r\nwho was very rich but of moderate education and who had secured through\r\nCosimo a mission away from Florence. When on setting out the man asked\r\nCosimo what course he thought ought to be taken in order to do well in\r\nthe mission, Cosimo replied: ‘Wear rose-colour,[287] and say little.’ Of\r\nthe same kind was what Count Ludovico said to a man who wished to travel\r\nincognito through a certain dangerous place and knew not how to disguise\r\nhimself; and being asked about it, the count replied: ‘Dress like a\r\ndoctor or some other man of sense.’ Again, Gianotto de’ Pazzi[288] said\r\nto someone who wished to make a jerkin of as varied colours as he could\r\nfind: ‘Imitate the Cardinal of Pavia in word and deed.’\r\n\r\n79.—“We laugh also at some things that have no connection. As when\r\nsomeone said the other day to messer Antonio Rizzo[289] about a certain\r\nman from Forli: ‘You may know he is a fool, for his name is\r\nBartolommeo.’ And another: ‘You are looking for a Master Stall, and have\r\nno horses!’ And: ‘All the fellow lacks is money and brains.’\r\n\r\n“And we laugh at certain other things that seem to have sequence. As\r\nrecently, when a friend of ours was suspected of having had the\r\nrenunciation[290] of a benefice forged, upon another priest’s falling\r\nsick, Antonio Torello[291] said to our friend: ‘Why do you delay to send\r\nfor that notary of yours and see about filching this other benefice?’\r\nLikewise at some things that have no sequence. As the other day, when\r\nthe pope sent for messer Gianluca da Pontremolo and messer Domenico\r\ndalla Porta (who are both hunchbacks as you know),[292] and made them\r\nauditors, saying that he wished to set the Wheel right,—messer Latino\r\nGiovenale[293] said: ‘His Holiness is in errour if he thinks to make the\r\nWheel right with two wrongs (_due torti_).’\r\n\r\n80.—“We often laugh also when a man admits everything that is said to\r\nhim and more too, but pretends to take it in a different sense. As when\r\nCaptain Peralta was brought out to fight a duel with Aldana, and Captain\r\nMolart[294] (who was Aldana’s second) asked Peralta on his oath if he\r\nwore any amulets or charms to keep him from being wounded; Peralta swore\r\nthat he wore no amulets or charms or relics or objects of devotion in\r\nwhich he had faith. Whereupon, to taunt him with being a heretic, Molart\r\nsaid: ‘Do not trouble yourself about it, for without your oath I believe\r\nyou have no faith in Christ himself.’[295]\r\n\r\n“Moreover it is a fine thing to use metaphors seasonably in such cases.\r\nAs when our friend master Marcantonio said to Bottone da Cesena,[296]\r\nwho was goading him with words: ‘Bottone, Bottone, you will one day be\r\nthe button (_bottone_), and your button-hole will be the halter.’\r\nAnother time, master Marcantonio having composed a very long comedy in\r\nseveral acts, this same Bottone said to master Marcantonio: ‘To play\r\nyour comedy, all the timber there is in Slavonia will be needed for the\r\nsetting.’ Master Marcantonio replied: ‘While for the setting of your\r\ntragedy, three sticks will be quite enough.’[297]\r\n\r\n81.—“We often use a word in which there is a hidden meaning remote from\r\nthe one we seem to intend. As was done by my lord Prefect here, on\r\nhearing mention of a certain captain who in his time had for the most\r\npart been defeated but just then had chanced to win. And the speaker\r\ntelling that when the captain made his entry into the place in question,\r\nhe had on a very beautiful crimson velvet doublet, which he always wore\r\nafter his victories, my lord Prefect said: ‘It must be new.’\r\n\r\n“Nor is there less laughter when we reply to something that our\r\ninterlocutor has not said, or pretend to believe he has done something\r\nthat he has not but ought to have done. As when Andrea Coscia,[298]\r\nhaving gone to visit a gentleman who rudely kept his seat and left his\r\nguest to stand, said: ‘Since your Lordship commands me, I will sit down\r\nto obey you;’ and so sat down.[299]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  POPE LEO X\r\n  GIOVANNI DE’ MEDICI\r\n  “MY LORD CARDINAL”\r\n  1475-1521\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from the central part of Braun’s photograph (no. 42.040) of the\r\n    triple portrait, in the Pitti Gallery at Florence, painted between\r\n    1517 and 1519 by Raphael (1483-1520) with the assistance of his\r\n    pupil Giulio Pippi, better known as Giulio Romano, (1492-1546).\r\n\r\n82.—“We laugh also when a man accuses himself of some fault humourously.\r\nAs when I told my lord Duke’s chaplain the other day that my lord\r\nCardinal[300] had a chaplain who said mass faster than he, he answered\r\nme: ‘It is not possible;’ and coming close to my ear, he said: ‘You must\r\nknow, I do not recite a third of the silent prayers.’\r\n\r\n“Again, a priest at Milan having died, Biagino Crivello[301] begged his\r\nbenefice of the Duke,[302] who however was minded to give it to someone\r\nelse. At last Biagino saw that further argument was of no avail, and\r\nsaid: ‘What! After I have had the priest killed, why will you not give\r\nme his benefice?’\r\n\r\n“It is often amusing also to express desire for those things that cannot\r\nbe. As the other day, when one of our friends saw all these gentlemen\r\nplaying at fence while he was lying on his bed, and said: ‘Ah, how glad\r\nI should be if this too were a fitting exercise for a strong man and a\r\ngood soldier!’\r\n\r\n“Moreover it is an amusing and spicy style of talk, and especially for\r\ngrave and dignified persons, to reply the opposite of what the person\r\nspoken to desires, but slowly and with a little air of doubtful and\r\nhesitating deliberation. As was once the case with King Alfonso I of\r\nAragon,[269] who gave a servant weapons, horses and clothes, because the\r\nfellow said he had the night before dreamed that his Highness had given\r\nhim all these things; and again not long afterwards the same servant\r\nsaid he had that night dreamed that the king gave him a goodly sum of\r\ngold florins, whereupon the king replied: ‘Put no trust in dreams\r\nhenceforth, because they are not true.’ Of like sort also was the pope’s\r\nreply to the Bishop of Cervia,[303] who said to him in order to sound\r\nhis purpose: ‘Holy Father, it is said all over Rome, and the palace too,\r\nthat your Holiness is making me governor.’ Then the pope replied: ‘Let\r\nthem talk,—they are only knaves. Have no fear there is any truth in it.’\r\n\r\n83.—“Perhaps, my Lords, I might collect still many other occasions that\r\ngive opportunity for humourous sallies: such as things said with\r\nshyness, with admiration, with threats, out of season, with excessive\r\nanger; besides these, certain other conditions that provoke laughter\r\nwhen they occur: sometimes a kind of wondering taciturnity, sometimes\r\nmere laughter itself when untimely. But methinks I have now said enough,\r\nfor I believe that pleasantry which takes the form of words does not\r\nexceed the limits we have discussed.\r\n\r\n“Then, as to that which is shown in action, although it has numberless\r\nforms, it still is comprised under a few heads. But in both kinds the\r\nmain thing is to cheat expectation and reply otherwise than the hearer\r\nlooks for; and if the pleasantry is to find favour, it must needs be\r\nseasoned with deceit or dissimulation or ridicule or censure or simile,\r\nor whatever other style a man chooses to employ. And while pleasantries\r\nprovoke laughter, yet with this laughter they produce divers other\r\neffects: for some contain a certain elegance and modest pleasantness,\r\nothers a hidden or an open sting, others have a taint of grossness,\r\nothers move to laughter as soon as they are heard, others the more they\r\nare thought of, others make us blush as well as laugh, others rouse a\r\nlittle anger. But in all methods we must consider our hearers’ state of\r\nmind, for to the afflicted jocosity often brings greater affliction, and\r\nthere are certain maladies that are aggravated the more medicine is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n“Hence if the Courtier pays heed to time, persons and his own rank, in\r\nhis banter and amusing talk, and uses them not too often (for in truth\r\nit begets tedium to be harping on this all day, in all kinds of\r\nconverse, in season and out), he may be called a man of humour; taking\r\ncare also not to be so sharp and biting as to be thought spiteful,\r\nassailing causelessly or with evident rancour: either those who are too\r\npowerful, which is imprudent; or those who are too weak, which is cruel;\r\nor those who are too wicked, which is useless; or saying things to\r\noffend those he would not offend, which is ignorance. Yet there are some\r\nwho feel bound to speak and assail recklessly whenever they can, let the\r\nconsequence be what it may. And among these last, some there are who do\r\nnot scruple to tarnish the honour of a noble lady, for the sake of\r\nsaying something humourous; which is a very evil thing and worthy the\r\nheaviest punishment, for in this regard ladies are to be numbered among\r\nthe weak, and so ought not to be assailed, since they have no weapons to\r\ndefend them.\r\n\r\n“Besides these things, he who would be agreeable and amusing must have a\r\ncertain natural aptitude for all kinds of fun, and must adapt his\r\nbehaviour, gestures and face accordingly; and the graver and more\r\nserious and impassive his face is, the more spicy and keen will he make\r\nhis sallies seem.\r\n\r\n84.—“But you, messer Federico, who thought to take your ease under this\r\nleafless tree and in my arid talk, I am sure you have repented of it and\r\nthink you have found your way to the Montefiore Inn.[304] Therefore it\r\nwill be well for you, like a practised postman, to rise somewhat earlier\r\nthan usual and take up your journey, in order to escape from a bad inn.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied messer Federico, “I have come to so good an inn that I\r\nmean to tarry in it longer than I first intended. So I shall go on\r\ntaking my ease until you have finished the whole discourse appointed, of\r\nwhich you have left out one part that you mentioned in the\r\nbeginning—that is, practical jokes; and it is not right for you to cheat\r\nthe company of this. But as you have taught us many fine things about\r\npleasantries, and have made us bold to use them by the example of so\r\nmany singular geniuses, great men, princes, kings, and popes,—so too in\r\npractical jokes I think you will give us such daring that we shall\r\nventure to try some even upon you.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“You will not be the first; but perhaps you may not succeed, for I have\r\nalready endured so many of them that I am on my guard against\r\neverything, like dogs who are afraid of cold water after once being\r\nscalded with hot. However, since you will have me speak of this also, I\r\nthink I can despatch it in a few words.\r\n\r\n85.—“It seems to me that practical joking is naught else but friendly\r\ndeceit in things that do not offend or that offend only a little. And\r\njust as in pleasantry it arouses laughter to say something contrary to\r\nexpectation, so in practical joking it arouses laughter to do something\r\ncontrary to expectation. And the cleverer and more discreet these jokes\r\nare, the more they please and are applauded; for he often gives offence\r\nwho tries to play a practical joke recklessly, and afterwards quarrels\r\nand serious enmities arise in consequence.\r\n\r\n“But the occasions that give opportunity for practical jokes are nearly\r\nthe same as in the case of pleasantries. So not to repeat them, I will\r\nmerely say that practical jokes are of two kinds, each of which kinds\r\nmight be further divided into classes. One kind is where anyone is\r\ncleverly tricked in a fine and amusing manner; the other is where a net\r\nis cast, as it were, and a little bait is offered, so that the victim\r\nhimself hastens to be tricked.\r\n\r\n“Of the first kind was the joke that two great ladies, whom I do not\r\nwish to name, lately had played upon them by means of a Spaniard called\r\nCastillo.”[305]\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“And why do you not wish to name them?”\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo replied:\r\n\r\n“I would not have them take offence.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess answered, laughing:\r\n\r\n“It is not amiss to play jokes now and then even upon great lords.\r\nIndeed I have heard of many being played upon Duke Federico, upon King\r\nAlfonso of Aragon, upon Queen Isabella of Spain, and upon many other\r\ngreat princes; and they not only did not take offence, but rewarded the\r\nperpetrators liberally.”\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo replied:\r\n\r\n“Not even for the hope of reward will I name those ladies.”\r\n\r\n“As you please,” answered my lady Duchess.\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo went on to say:\r\n\r\n“It is not long since there arrived at the court (of I know whom) a\r\nBergamasque rustic on business for a courtier gentleman; and this rustic\r\nwas so well attired and elegantly appointed that, although he had been\r\nonly used to tend cattle and knew no other trade, anyone who did not\r\nhear him speak would have taken him for a gallant cavalier. Now, being\r\ntold that a Spanish follower of Cardinal Borgia[306] had arrived, and\r\nthat he was called Castillo and was exceedingly clever, a musician, a\r\ndancer, a _ballatore_,[307] and the most accomplished Courtier in all\r\nSpain,—these two ladies were filled with extreme desire to speak with\r\nhim, and straightway sent for him. And after receiving him with\r\nceremony, they made him sit down and began to speak to him with the\r\ngreatest distinction before all the company; and there were few of those\r\npresent who did not know that the fellow was a Bergamasque cow-herd. So\r\nwhen these ladies were seen entertaining him with so much respect and\r\nhonouring him so signally, the laughter was very hearty, the more so as\r\nthe good man spoke his native Bergamasque dialect all the while.[308]\r\nBut the gentlemen who played the trick had told these ladies in the\r\nbeginning that he was among other things a great joker, and spoke all\r\nlanguages admirably and especially rustic Lombard. Thus they continually\r\nimagined that he was pretending, and they often turned to each other\r\nwith an air of surprise, and said: ‘Listen to this prodigy, how well he\r\ncounterfeits the language!’ In short, the conversation lasted so long\r\nthat everyone’s sides ached from laughing; and he himself could not help\r\ngiving so many tokens of his gentility that even these ladies were at\r\nlast convinced, albeit with great difficulty, that he was what he was.\r\n\r\n86.—“We meet practical jokes of this kind every day; but among the rest\r\nthose are amusing which at first excite alarm and turn out well in the\r\nend; for even the victim laughs at himself when he sees that his fears\r\nwere groundless.\r\n\r\n“For instance, I was staying at Paglia[309] one night, and in the same\r\ninn where I was there happened to be three companions besides myself\r\n(two from Pistoia and the other from Prato), who sat down to play after\r\nsupper, as men often do. They had not been playing long before one of\r\nthe two Pistoians lost all he had and was left without a farthing, so\r\nthat he began to lament and to curse and swear roundly; and he retired\r\nto sleep blaspheming thus. After gaming awhile, the other two resolved\r\nto play a trick upon the one who had gone to bed. So, making sure that\r\nhe was really asleep, they put out all the lights and covered the fire;\r\nthen they began to talk loud and to make as much noise as they could,\r\npretending to quarrel over their play, and one of them said: ‘You’ve\r\ndrawn the under card;’ and the other denied it, saying: ‘And you have\r\nwagered on four of a suit; let us deal again;’[310] and the like, with\r\nsuch an uproar that the sleeper awoke. And perceiving that his friends\r\nwere playing and talking as if they saw the cards, he rubbed his eyes a\r\nlittle, and seeing no light in the room, he said: ‘What the devil do you\r\nmean by shouting all night?’ Then he lay back again as if to go to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n“His two friends made no reply, but went on as before; whereat the man\r\nbegan to wonder (now that he was more awake) and seeing that there was\r\nreally no fire or glimmer of any kind, and that still his friends were\r\nplaying and quarrelling, he said: ‘And how can you see the cards without\r\nlight?’ One of the two replied: ‘You must have lost your sight along\r\nwith your money; don’t you see with these two candles we have here?’ The\r\nman who was abed lifted himself upon his arms, and said rather angrily:\r\n‘Either I am drunk or blind, or you are lying.’ The two got up and\r\ngroped their way to the bed, laughing and pretending to think that he\r\nwas making sport of them; and still he answered: ‘I say I do not see\r\nyou.’ Finally the two began to feign great surprise, and one said to the\r\nother: ‘Alas, methinks he speaks the truth. Hand me that candle, and let\r\nus see if perchance there is something wrong with his sight.’ Then the\r\npoor fellow took it for certain that he had become blind, and weeping\r\nbitterly he said: ‘Oh my brothers, I am blind;’ and he at once began to\r\ncall on Our Lady of Loreto, and to implore her to pardon the blasphemies\r\nand maledictions that he had heaped upon her for the loss of his money.\r\nHis two companions kept comforting him, and said: ‘It can’t be that you\r\ndo not see us; ’tis some fancy you’ve got into your head.’ ‘Alas,’\r\nreplied the other, ‘this is no fancy, for I see no more than as if I had\r\nnever had any eyes in my head.’ ‘Yet your sight is clear,’ replied the\r\ntwo, and one said to the other: ‘See how well he opens his eyes! And how\r\nbright they are! Who could believe that he doesn’t see?’ The unhappy man\r\nwept more loudly all the while, and begged mercy of God.\r\n\r\n“At last they said to him: ‘Make a vow to go in penance to Our Lady of\r\nLoreto,[311] barefoot and naked, for this is the best remedy that can be\r\nfound; and meanwhile we will go to Acquapendente[312] and those other\r\nplaces hard by to see some doctor, nor will we fail to do everything we\r\ncan for you.’ Then the poor fellow quickly knelt by his bed, and with\r\nendless tears and bitter penitence for his blasphemy he made a solemn\r\nvow to go naked to Our Lady of Loreto, and to offer her a pair of silver\r\neyes, and to eat no flesh on Wednesday or eggs on Friday, and to fast on\r\nbread and water every Saturday in honour of Our Lady, if she would grant\r\nhim the mercy of restoring his sight. His two companions went into\r\nanother room, struck a light, and laughing their very loudest, came back\r\nto the unhappy man, who was relieved of his great anguish, as you may\r\nimagine, but was so stunned by the terror that he had passed through,\r\nthat he could neither laugh nor even speak; and his two companions did\r\nnothing but tease him, saying that he must fulfil all his vows, because\r\nhe had obtained the mercy which he sought.\r\n\r\n87.—“Of the other kind of practical joke, where a man deceives himself,\r\nI shall give no other example than the one that was played on me not\r\nvery long ago.\r\n\r\n“During the last carnival, my friend Monsignor of San Pietro ad\r\nVincula[313] (who knows how fond I am of playing tricks on the friars\r\nwhen I am masked, and who had carefully arranged beforehand what he\r\nmeant to do) came one day with Monsignor of Aragon[314] and a few other\r\ncardinals, to certain windows in the _Banchi_,[315] ostensibly for the\r\npurpose of seeing the maskers pass, as the custom is at Rome. I came\r\nalong in my mask, and seeing a friar (somewhat apart) who had a little\r\nair of hesitation, I thought I had found my chance and rushed upon him\r\nlike a hungry falcon on its prey. And first having asked him who he was\r\nand received his answer, I pretended to know him, and with many words\r\nbegan to make him think that the chief constable was out in search of\r\nhim (because of certain evil reports that had been received against\r\nhim), and to urge him to go with me to the Chancery,[316] where I would\r\nput him in safety. Frightened and trembling from head to foot, the friar\r\nseemed not to know what to do and said he feared being taken if he went\r\nfar from San Celso.[317] I said so much to encourage him, however, that\r\nhe mounted my crupper; and then I thought I had fully succeeded in my\r\nscheme. So I at once began to make for the _Banchi_, my horse frisking\r\nand kicking the while. Now imagine what a fine sight a friar made on a\r\nmasker’s crupper, with cloak flying and head tossed to and fro, and\r\nlooking all the time as if he were about to fall.\r\n\r\n“At this fine spectacle those gentlemen began to throw eggs on us from\r\nthe windows, as did all the _Banchi_ people and everyone who was\r\nthere,—so that hail never fell from heaven with greater violence than\r\nfrom those windows fell the eggs, most of which came on me. Being masked\r\nas I was, I did not care and thought that all the laughter was for the\r\nfriar and not for me; and so I went up and down the _Banchi_ several\r\ntimes with this fury always at my back, although the friar with tears in\r\nhis eyes begged me to let him dismount and not to shame his cloth in\r\nthis way. Then the knave had eggs given him on the sly by some lackeys\r\nstationed there for the purpose, and pretending to hold me fast to keep\r\nfrom falling, he broke them over my breast, often over my head, and\r\nsometimes on my very brow, until I was completely bedaubed. Finally,\r\nwhen everyone was weary both of laughing and of throwing eggs, he jumped\r\noff my crupper, and pushing back his cowl showed me his long hair, and\r\nsaid: ‘Messer Bernardo, I am one of the grooms at San Pietro ad Vincula,\r\nand it is I who take care of your little mule.’\r\n\r\n“I know not which was then greatest, my grief, my anger, or my shame.\r\nHowever, as the least of evils, I set out fast for home, and dared not\r\nmake an appearance the next morning; but the laughter raised by this\r\ntrick lasted not only the next day, but nearly until now.”\r\n\r\n88.—And so, after they had again laughed awhile at the story, messer\r\nBernardo continued:\r\n\r\n“There is another very amusing kind of practical joke, which gives\r\nopportunity for pleasantry as well, when we pretend to think that a man\r\nwishes to do something which in fact he does not wish to do. For\r\ninstance, one evening after supper, when I was on the bridge at Lyons\r\nand jesting with Cesare Beccadello[318] as we walked along, we began to\r\nseize each other by the arm as if we were bent on wrestling, for by\r\nchance no one else appeared on the bridge at the time. While we were\r\nstanding thus, two Frenchmen came up, and on seeing our dispute they\r\nasked what the matter was, and stopped to try to separate us, thinking\r\nthat we were quarrelling in earnest. Then I said quickly: ‘Help me,\r\nSirs, for this poor gentleman loses his reason at certain changes of the\r\nmoon, and you see he is now trying to throw himself off the bridge into\r\nthe water.’ Thereupon these two men ran, and with my aid seized Cesare\r\nand held him very tight; and he, telling me all the while that I was\r\nmad, tried harder to free himself from their hands, and they held him\r\nall the tighter. Thus the passers-by gathered to look at the\r\ndisturbance, and everyone ran up. And the more poor Cesare struck out\r\nwith his hands and feet (for he was now beginning to grow angry), the\r\nmore people arrived; and from the great effort that he made, they fully\r\nbelieved he was trying to jump into the river, and on that account held\r\nhim the tighter. So that a great crowd of men carried him bodily to the\r\ninn, all dishevelled, capless, pale with anger and shame; for nothing he\r\nsaid availed him, partly because the Frenchmen did not understand him,\r\nand also partly because, as I walked along leading them to the inn, I\r\nkept lamenting the poor man’s misfortune in being thus stricken mad.\r\n\r\n89.—“Now, as we have said, it would be possible to talk at length about\r\npractical jokes; but suffice it to repeat that the occasions which give\r\nopportunity for them are the same as in the case of pleasantries.\r\nMoreover we have an infinity of examples because we see them every day.\r\nAmong others there are many amusing ones in the _Novelle_ of Boccaccio,\r\nlike those which Bruno and Buffalmacco played upon their friend\r\nCalandrino and upon master Simone,[319] and many others played by women,\r\nthat are truly clever and fine.\r\n\r\n“I remember having known in my time many other amusing men of this sort,\r\nand among others a certain Sicilian student at Padua, called\r\nPonzio;[320] who once saw a peasant with a pair of fat capons. And\r\npretending that he wished to buy them, he struck a bargain, and told the\r\nfellow to come home with him and get some breakfast besides the price\r\nagreed on. So he led the peasant to a place where there was a bell-tower\r\nstanding apart from its church[321] so that one could walk around it;\r\nand just opposite one of the four sides of the tower was the end of a\r\nlittle lane. Here Ponzio, who had already settled what he meant to do,\r\nsaid to the peasant: ‘I have wagered these capons with one of my\r\nfriends, who says that this tower measures quite forty feet around,\r\nwhile I say it does not. And just before I found you, I had bought this\r\ntwine to measure it. Now, before we go home I wish to find out which of\r\nthe two has won.’ And so saying, he drew the twine from his sleeve, gave\r\none end of it to the peasant, and said: ‘Hand them here.’ Thereupon he\r\ntook the capons, and holding the other end of the twine as if he were\r\ngoing to measure, he started to walk around the tower, first making the\r\npeasant stay and hold the twine against that side of it which was\r\nfarthest from the one that looked up the little lane. When he reached\r\nthis other side, he stuck a nail into the wall, tied the twine to it,\r\nand leaving the man there he quietly went off with the capons up the\r\nlittle lane. The peasant stood still a long time waiting for Ponzio to\r\nfinish the measurement; at last,—after he had several times said: ‘What\r\nare you doing there so long?’—he went to look, and found that it was not\r\nPonzio who was holding the twine, but a nail stuck in the wall, and that\r\nthis was all the pay left him for the capons. Ponzio played numberless\r\ntricks of this sort.\r\n\r\n“There have also been many other men who were amusing in like manner,\r\nsuch as Gonnella, Meliolo in his day,[322] and at the present time our\r\nfriends Fra Mariano[60] and Fra Serafino[61] here, and many whom you all\r\nknow. And doubtless this method is well enough for men who have no other\r\nbusiness, but I think the Courtier’s practical jokes ought to be\r\nsomewhat farther removed from scurrility. Care must be taken also not to\r\nlet practical joking degenerate into knavery, as we see in the case of\r\nmany rogues, who go through the world with sundry wiles to get money,\r\nnow pretending one thing and now another. Moreover the Courtier’s tricks\r\nmust not be too rude; and above all let him pay respect and reverence to\r\nwomen in this as in all other things, and especially where their honour\r\nmay be touched.”\r\n\r\n90.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Indeed, messer Bernardo, you are too partial towards women. And why\r\nwould you have men pay more respect to women than women to men? Should\r\nnot our honour be as dear to us, forsooth, as theirs to them? Do you\r\nthink that women ought to taunt men with words and nonsense without the\r\nleast restraint in anything, and that men should quietly endure it and\r\nthank them into the bargain?”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo replied:\r\n\r\n“I do not say that in their pleasantries and practical jokes women ought\r\nnot to use towards men the same respect which we have before described;\r\nbut I do say they may taunt men with unchastity more freely than men may\r\ntaunt them. And this is because we have made unto ourselves a law,\r\nwhereby free living is in us neither vice nor fault nor disgrace, while\r\nin women it is such utter infamy and shame that she of whom evil is once\r\nspoken is disgraced forever, whether the imputation[323] cast upon her\r\nbe false or true. Wherefore, since speaking of women’s honour brings\r\nsuch risk of doing them grievous harm, I say we ought to attack them in\r\nsome other way, and to abstain from this; because to strike too hard\r\nwith our pleasantries and practical jokes, is to exceed the bounds that\r\nwe have before said are befitting a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n91.—As messer Bernardo paused a little here, my lord Ottaviano Fregoso\r\nsaid, laughing:\r\n\r\n“My lord Gaspar might answer you that this law you refer to, which we\r\nhave made unto ourselves, is perhaps not so unreasonable as it seems to\r\nyou. For since women were very imperfect creatures and of little or no\r\nworth in comparison with men, and since of themselves they were not\r\ncapable of performing any worthy act,—it was necessary by fear of shame\r\nand infamy to lay upon them a restraint that might impart some quality\r\nof goodness to them almost against their will. And chastity seemed more\r\nneedful for them than any other quality, in order to have certainty as\r\nto our offspring; hence it was necessary to use every possible skill,\r\nart and way to make women chaste, and almost to permit them to be of\r\nlittle worth in all things else and to do constantly the reverse of what\r\nthey ought. Therefore, since they are allowed to commit all other faults\r\nwithout blame, if we taunt them with those defects which (as we have\r\nsaid) are all permitted to them and therefore not incongruous in them,\r\nand of which they take no heed,—we shall never arouse laughter; for you\r\nsaid awhile ago that laughter is aroused by certain things that are\r\nincongruous.”\r\n\r\n92.—Then my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“You speak thus of women, my lord Ottaviano, and then you complain that\r\nthey love you not.”\r\n\r\n“I do not complain of this,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “but rather\r\nthank them in that they do not, by loving me, force me to love them. Nor\r\nam I speaking my own mind, but saying that my lord Gaspar might use\r\nthese arguments.”\r\n\r\nMesser Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“Verily it would be a great gain to women if they could conciliate two\r\nsuch great enemies of theirs as you and my lord Gaspar are.”\r\n\r\n“I am not their enemy,” replied my lord Gaspar, “but you are indeed an\r\nenemy of men; for if you would not have women taunted as to their\r\nhonour, you ought also to impose on them a law that they shall not taunt\r\nmen for that which is as shameful to us as unchastity is to women. And\r\nwhy was not Alonso Carillo’s retort to my lady Boadilla (about hoping to\r\nescape with his life by being asked to become her husband) as seemly in\r\nhim, as it was for her to say that all who knew him thought the king was\r\nabout to have him hanged? And why was it not as allowable for Riciardo\r\nMinutoli to deceive Filippello’s wife and get her to go to that resort,\r\nas for Beatrice to make her husband Egano[324] get out of bed and be\r\ncudgelled by Anichino, after she had long been with the latter? And for\r\nthat other woman to tie a string to her toe and make her husband believe\r\nthat she was someone else?—since you say that these women’s pranks in\r\nGiovanni Boccaccio are so clever and fine.”\r\n\r\n93.—Then messer Bernardo said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“My Lords, as my task was simply to discuss pleasantries, I do not mean\r\nto go outside my subject. And I think I have already told why it does\r\nnot seem to me befitting to attack women in their honour either by word\r\nor deed, and have imposed on them as well a rule that they shall not\r\ntouch men in a tender spot.\r\n\r\n“As for the pranks and sallies cited by you, my lord Gaspar, I grant\r\nthat although what Alonso said to my lady Boadilla may touch a little on\r\nher chastity, it still does not displease me, because it is very remote,\r\nand is so veiled that it may be taken innocently, and the speaker might\r\ndisguise his meaning and declare he had not meant it. He said another\r\nthat was to my thinking very unseemly. And it was this: as the\r\nqueen[325] was passing my lady Boadilla’s house,[280] Alonso saw the\r\ndoor all blackened with pictures of those indecencies that are painted\r\nabout inns in such variety; and turning to the Countess of\r\nCastagneta,[326] he said: ‘There, my Lady, are the heads of the game\r\nthat my lady Boadilla slays in hunting every day.’ You see that while\r\nthe metaphor is clever and aptly borrowed from hunters (who take pride\r\nin having many heads of beasts fastened on their doors), yet it is\r\nscurrilous and disgraceful. Besides which, it was not an answer to\r\nanything; for it is far less rude to say a thing by way of retort,\r\nbecause then it seems to have been provoked and needs must be impromptu.\r\n\r\n“Returning, however, to the subject of tricks played by women, I do not\r\nsay they do well to deceive their husbands, but I say that some of those\r\ndeceptions (which Giovanni Boccaccio recounts of women) are fine and\r\nvery clever, and especially those which you yourself told. But in my\r\nopinion the trick played by Riciardo Minutoli goes too far, and is much\r\nmore heartless than the one played by Beatrice; because Riciardo\r\nMinutoli did much greater wrong to Filippello’s wife than Beatrice did\r\nto her husband Egano, for by his deception Riciardo forced the woman’s\r\nwill and made her do with herself something that she did not wish to do,\r\nwhile Beatrice deceived her husband in order that she might do with\r\nherself something that pleased her.”\r\n\r\n94.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Beatrice can be excused on no other plea than that of love, which ought\r\nto be allowed in the case of men as well as in that of women.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo replied:\r\n\r\n“No doubt the passion of love affords great excuse for every fault. But\r\nfor my part I think that a gentleman of worth, who is in love, ought to\r\nbe sincere and truthful in this as in all things else; and if it be true\r\nthat to betray even an enemy is such a vile act and abominable crime,\r\nconsider how much more heinous the offence ought to be deemed when it is\r\ncommitted against one whom we love.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, I think that every gentle lover endures so many toils, so\r\nmany vigils, braves so many perils, sheds so many tears, employs so many\r\nmeans and ways to please the lady of his love,—not chiefly in order to\r\npossess her person, but to capture the fortress of her mind, and to\r\nshatter those hardest diamonds, to melt that coldest ice, that often are\r\nin the tender breast of woman. This, I think, is the true and sound\r\npleasure and the purposed goal of every noble heart. For myself, were I\r\nin love, I certainly should prefer to be assured that she whom I served\r\nreturned my love from her heart and had given me her mind,—without ever\r\nhaving any other satisfaction from her,—than to enjoy her to the full\r\nagainst her will; for in such case I should deem myself the master of a\r\nlifeless body. Hence they who pursue their desires by means of such\r\ntrickery, which might perhaps be called treachery rather than trickery,\r\ndo injury to others; nor have they yet that bliss which is to be desired\r\nin love, if they possess the body without the will.\r\n\r\n“The same I say of certain others who use enchantments in their love,\r\ncharms and sometimes force, sometimes sleeping potions and such like\r\nthings. Be assured, too, that gifts much lessen the pleasures of love;\r\nfor a man may suspect that he is not loved and that his lady makes a\r\nshow of loving him in order to profit by it. Hence you see that great\r\nladies’ love is prized because it could hardly spring from other source\r\nthan real and true affection, nor is it credible that a great lady\r\nshould ever pretend to love one of her inferiors unless she loves him\r\ntruly.”\r\n\r\n95.—Then my lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“I do not deny that the purpose, toils and dangers of lovers ought to\r\nhave their aim directed chiefly towards the conquest of the mind rather\r\nthan of the body of their beloved. But I say that these deceits, which\r\nyou call treachery in men and trickery in women, are excellent means of\r\nattaining this aim, for whoever possesses a woman’s person is master of\r\nher mind as well. And if you remember rightly, Filippello’s wife, after\r\nmuch lament over the deceit practised on her by Riciardo, discovered how\r\nmuch more delicious than her husband’s were the kisses of her lover, and\r\nher coldness to Riciardo changed to sweet affection, so that from that\r\nday forth she loved him most tenderly. Thus it came about that what his\r\nfrequent fond visits, his gifts and countless other tokens shown\r\nunceasingly, could not affect, a taste of his embraces soon\r\naccomplished. You now see that this same trickery, or treachery as you\r\nwould call it, was a good way to capture the fortress of her mind.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“You advance a very false premise, for if women always surrendered their\r\nmind to the man who possessed their person, no wife would be found who\r\ndid not love her husband more than every other person in the world; the\r\ncontrary of which we find to be the case. But Giovanni Boccaccio was\r\nvery unjustly hostile to women, as you are also.”[327]\r\n\r\n96.—My lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“I am not at all hostile to them; but there are very few men of worth\r\nwho as a rule make any account of women whatever, although for their own\r\npurposes they sometimes pretend the contrary.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo replied:\r\n\r\n“You wrong not women only, but also all men who hold them in respect.\r\nHowever, as I said, I do not wish for the present to go outside my\r\noriginal subject of practical joking, and enter upon so difficult an\r\nenterprise as would be the defence of women against you, who are a most\r\nredoubtable warrior. So I will make an end of this talk of mine, which\r\nhas perhaps been far longer than was necessary, and certainly less\r\namusing than you expected. And since I see the ladies sit so quiet,\r\nenduring your insults thus patiently as they do, I shall henceforth\r\nregard a part of what my lord Ottaviano said as true, namely, that they\r\ncare not what other evil is said of them, provided they be not taunted\r\nwith lack of chastity.”\r\n\r\nThen at a signal from my lady Duchess, many of the ladies rose to their\r\nfeet, and all ran laughing towards my lord Gaspar, as if to shower blows\r\nupon him and treat him as the bacchants treated Orpheus,[328]—meanwhile\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“You shall see now whether we care if evil be said of us.”\r\n\r\n97.—Thus, partly because of the laughter and partly because everyone\r\nrose to his feet, the drowsiness that had seized the eyes and mind of\r\nsome, seemed to flee away; but my lord Gaspar began to say:\r\n\r\n“You see that being in the wrong, they would fain use force and thus end\r\nthe discussion by giving us a Braccesque leave, as the saying is.”[329]\r\n\r\nThen my lady Emilia replied:\r\n\r\n“Nay, that shall not help you; for when you saw messer Bernardo wearied\r\nby his long talk, you began to say all manner of evil about women,\r\nthinking to have no antagonist. But we shall put a fresh champion in the\r\nfield to fight you, to the end that your offence may not go long\r\nunpunished.”\r\n\r\nSo, turning to the Magnifico Giuliano, who had thus far spoken little,\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n“You are accounted the defender of women’s honour; wherefore the time\r\nhas come for you to show that you have not acquired this title falsely.\r\nAnd if hitherto you have ever found profit in your office, you ought now\r\nto consider that by putting down so bitter an enemy of ours, you will\r\nrender all women still more beholden to you, so much so that although\r\nnothing else be ever done but requite you, yet the obligation must\r\nalways stand and can never fully be requited.”\r\n\r\n98.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, methinks you do your enemy much honour, and your defender very\r\nlittle; for so far my lord Gaspar has certainly said nothing against\r\nwomen that messer Bernardo has not most consummately answered. And I\r\nbelieve we all know that it is fitting for the Courtier to show women\r\nthe greatest reverence, and that he who is discreet and courteous must\r\nnever taunt them with lack of chastity, either in jest or in earnest.\r\nTherefore, to discuss such obvious truth as this, is almost to cast\r\ndoubt upon that which is undoubted. But indeed I think my lord Ottaviano\r\nwent rather too far when he said that women are very imperfect\r\ncreatures, incapable of any worthy action, and possessed of little or no\r\ndignity in comparison with men. And as trust is often placed in those\r\nwho have great authority, even when they say what is not the exact truth\r\nand also when they speak in jest,—my lord Gaspar suffered himself to be\r\nled by my lord Ottaviano’s words to say that wise men make no account of\r\nwomen whatever, which is most false. On the contrary, I have known very\r\nfew men of merit who did not love and honour women,—whose worth (and so\r\nwhose dignity) I regard as in no wise inferior to men’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                            UNICUS ARETINUS\r\n                            Bernardo Accolti\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JO.

But if the contest were to\r\nbe fair, we should first need to have someone as clever and eloquent as\r\nCount Ludovico and messer Federico are, to describe a Court Lady with\r\nall the perfections proper to woman, just as they have described the\r\nCourtier with the perfections proper to man. And then, if he who\r\ndefended their cause were of only moderate cleverness and eloquence, I\r\nthink that with truth for ally, he would clearly prove that women are as\r\nfull of virtue as men are.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied my lady Emilia, “far more so; and in proof of this, you\r\nsee that virtue (_la virtù_) is feminine, and vice (_il vizio_) is\r\nmasculine.”[330]\r\n\r\n99.—Then my lord Gaspar laughed, and turning to messer Niccolò Frisio,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“What think you of this, Frisio?”\r\n\r\nFrisio replied:\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for my lord Magnifico, who has been beguiled by my lady\r\nEmilia’s promises and soft words into the errour of saying that which I\r\nblush for on his behalf.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia replied, still laughing:\r\n\r\n“You will be ashamed rather of yourself, when you see my lord Gaspar\r\nconfuted, confessing his own and your errour, and imploring a pardon\r\nthat we shall refuse to grant him.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“As the hour is very late, let the whole matter be postponed until\r\nto-morrow; especially since it seems to me wise to follow my lord\r\nMagnifico’s counsel, which is: that before we enter upon this\r\ncontroversy, a Court Lady be described with all her perfections, just as\r\nthese gentlemen have described the perfect Courtier.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, God forbid that we chance to entrust this task to any\r\nfellow-conspirator of my lord Gaspar, who will describe us a Court Lady\r\nthat can do naught but cook and spin.”\r\n\r\nFrisio said:\r\n\r\n“But this is her proper calling.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“I am willing to trust my lord Magnifico, who will (with the cleverness\r\nand good sense which I know are his) imagine the highest perfection that\r\ncan be desired in woman, and will set it forth in beautiful language\r\ntoo; and then we shall have something to offer against my lord Gaspar’s\r\nfalse aspersions.”\r\n\r\n100.—“My Lady,” replied the Magnifico, “I am not sure how well advised\r\nyou are to impose on me an enterprise of such weight that I really do\r\nnot feel myself sufficient for it. Nor am I like the Count and messer\r\nFederico, who have with their eloquence described a Courtier that never\r\nwas and perhaps never can be. Still, if it pleases you to have me bear\r\nthis burden, at least let it be upon the same conditions as in the case\r\nof these other gentlemen, namely: that everyone may contradict me when\r\nhe pleases; for I shall take it, not as contradiction, but as aid; and\r\nperhaps by the correction of my mistakes we shall discover that\r\nperfection of the Court Lady which we seek.”\r\n\r\n“I hope,” replied my lady Duchess, “that your talk will be of such sort\r\nthat little may be found in it to contradict. So give your whole mind to\r\nit, and describe for us such a woman that these adversaries of ours\r\nshall be ashamed to say she is not equal in worth to the Courtier; of\r\nwhom it will be well for messer Federico to say no more, since the\r\nCourtier has been only too well adorned by him, especially as there is\r\nnow need to give him a paragon in woman.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, little or nothing is now left for me to tell about the\r\nCourtier; and what I thought of saying has been driven from my mind by\r\nmesser Bernardo’s pleasantries.”\r\n\r\n“If that be so,” said my lady Duchess, “let us come together again early\r\nto-morrow, and we shall have time to attend to both matters.”\r\n\r\nThereupon all rose to their feet, and having reverently taken leave of\r\nmy lady Duchess, everyone went to his own room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE THIRD BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n                     BY COUNT BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO\r\n\r\n1.—We read that Pythagoras very ingeniously and cleverly discovered the\r\nmeasure of Hercules’s body; and the way was this: it being known that\r\nthe space where the Olympic games were celebrated every five years,\r\nbefore the temple of Olympian Jove near Elis, in Achaia,[331] had been\r\nmeasured by Hercules, and a stadium made six hundred and twenty-five\r\ntimes the length of his own foot; and that the other stadia which were\r\nafterwards established throughout Greece by later generations, were\r\nlikewise of the length of six hundred and twenty-five feet, and yet were\r\nsomewhat shorter than the first one: by this proportion Pythagoras\r\neasily reckoned how much larger Hercules’s foot was than other human\r\nfeet; and thus, knowing the measure of the foot, from this he argued\r\nthat the whole body of Hercules was larger than other men’s in the same\r\nproportion that the first stadium bore to the other stadia.\r\n\r\nSo you, my dear messer Alfonso, by the same reasoning may clearly see,\r\nfrom this small part of the whole body, how superior the court of Urbino\r\nwas to all others in Italy, considering how much the games that were\r\ndevised for the refreshment of minds wearied by the most arduous\r\nlabours, were superior to those that were practised in the other courts\r\nof Italy. And if these were of such sort, think what were the other\r\nworthy pursuits to which our minds were bent and wholly given; and of\r\nthis I confidently make bold to speak with hope of being believed; for I\r\nam not praising things so ancient that I might be allowed to invent, but\r\ncan prove what I affirm by the testimony of many men worthy of faith,\r\nwho are still living and personally saw and knew the life and behaviour\r\nthat one time flourished in that court: and I hold myself bound, as far\r\nas I can, to strive with every effort to rescue this bright memory from\r\nmortal oblivion, and by my writing to make it live in the hearts of\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nWherefore perhaps in the future there will not be lacking some to envy\r\nour century for this also; since no one reads the wonderful exploits of\r\nthe ancients, who in his mind does not conceive a somewhat higher\r\nopinion of those that are written of than the books themselves seem able\r\nto express, however divinely they be written. Even so we desire that all\r\nto whose hands this work of ours shall come (if indeed it shall ever be\r\nworthy of such favour as to deserve being seen by noble cavaliers and\r\nvirtuous ladies) may assume and take for certain that the court of\r\nUrbino was far more excellent, and adorned by men of singular worth,\r\nthan we can express in writing; and if we had as great eloquence as they\r\nhad merit, we should have no need of other proof to make our words\r\nbelieved by those who saw it not.\r\n\r\n2.—Now the company being assembled the next day at the accustomed hour\r\nand place, and seated in silence, everyone turned his eyes to messer\r\nFederico and to the Magnifico Giuliano, waiting to see which of them\r\nwould begin the discussion. Wherefore my lady Duchess, having been\r\nsilent awhile, said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Magnifico, everyone desires to see this lady of yours well\r\nadorned; and if you do not display her to us in such fashion that all\r\nher beauties may be seen, we shall think that you are jealous of her.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, if I deemed her beautiful, I should display her all unadorned\r\nand in the same fashion wherein Paris chose to view the three\r\ngoddesses;[332] but if these ladies here, who well know how, do not aid\r\nme to deck her forth, I fear that not only my lord Gaspar and Frisio,\r\nbut all these other gentlemen, will have just cause to say ill of her.\r\nSo, while still she stands in some repute for beauty, perhaps it will be\r\nbetter to keep her hidden, and to see what messer Federico has left to\r\nsay about the Courtier, which without doubt is far more beautiful than\r\nmy Lady can be.”\r\n\r\n“What I had in mind,” replied messer Federico, “is not so necessary to\r\nthe Courtier that it may not be omitted without any harm; nay, it is\r\nrather different matter from that which has thus far been discussed.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it, then?” said my lady Duchess.\r\n\r\nMesser Federico replied:\r\n\r\n“I had thought of explaining, as far as I could, the origin of these\r\ncompanies and orders of knighthood established by great princes under\r\ndifferent ensigns: as that of Saint Michael in the House of France;[333]\r\nthat of the Garter, which bears the name of Saint George, in the House\r\nof England;[334] the Golden Fleece in that of Burgundy:[335] and in what\r\nmanner these dignities are bestowed, and how they who deserve them are\r\ndeprived thereof; whence they arose, who were the founders of them, and\r\nto what end they were established: for even in great courts these\r\nknights are always honoured.\r\n\r\n“I thought too, if I had time enough, to speak not only of the diversity\r\nof customs that are in use at the courts of Christian princes in serving\r\nthem, in merry-making and in appearing at public shows, but also to say\r\nsomething of the Grand Turk’s[252] court, and much more particularly of\r\nthe court of the Sophi king of Persia.[336] For having heard, from\r\nmerchants who have been long in that country, that the noblemen there\r\nare of great worth and gentle behaviour, and that in their intercourse\r\nwith one another, in their service to ladies and in all their actions,\r\nthey practise much courtesy and much discretion, and on occasion much\r\nmagnificence, much liberality and elegance in their weapons, games and\r\nfestivals,—I was glad to learn what ways they most prize in these\r\nthings, and in what their pomp and finery of dress and arms consist; in\r\nwhat they differ from us, and in what they resemble us; what manner of\r\namusements their ladies practise and with what modesty show favour to\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\n“But indeed it is not fitting to enter upon this discussion now,\r\nespecially as there is something else to say, and far more to our\r\npurpose than this.”\r\n\r\n3.—“Nay,” said my lord Gaspar, “both this and many other things are more\r\nto the purpose than to describe this Court Lady; seeing that the same\r\nrules that are set the Courtier, serve also for the Lady; for she, like\r\nthe Courtier, ought to have regard to time and place, and (as far as her\r\nstupidity permits) to follow all those other ways that have been so much\r\ndiscussed. And therefore, in place of this, perhaps it would not have\r\nbeen amiss to teach some of the details that pertain to the service of\r\nthe Prince’s person, for it is well befitting the Courtier to know them\r\nand to show grace in practising them; or indeed to tell of the method to\r\nbe pursued in bodily exercises, such as riding, handling weapons and\r\nwrestling, and to tell wherein consists the difficulty of these\r\naccomplishments.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Princes do not employ the personal service of so admirable a Courtier\r\nas this: and as for bodily exercises and physical strength and agility,\r\nwe will leave to our friend messer Pietro Monte the duty of teaching\r\nthem, when he shall deem the season more convenient; for now the\r\nMagnifico must speak of nothing but this Lady, of whom, methinks, you\r\nare already beginning to be afraid, and so would make us wander from our\r\nsubject.”\r\n\r\nFrisio replied:\r\n\r\n“Surely it is irrelevant and little to the purpose to speak of women\r\nnow, especially when more remains to be said about the Courtier, for we\r\nought not to mix one thing with another.”\r\n\r\n“You are much in errour,” replied messer Cesare Gonzaga; “for just as no\r\ncourt, however great it be, can have in it adornment or splendour or\r\ngaiety, without ladies, nor can any Courtier be graceful or pleasing or\r\nbrave, or perform any gallant feat of chivalry, unless moved by the\r\nsociety and by the love and pleasure of ladies: so, too, discussion\r\nabout the Courtier is always very imperfect, unless by taking part\r\ntherein the ladies add their touch of that grace wherewith they perfect\r\nCourtiership and adorn it.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“There you have a taste of that bait which makes men fools.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GIULIANO DE’ MEDICI\r\n  “MY LORD MAGNIFICO”\r\n  1479-1516\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom Alinari’s photograph (no. 359) of the portrait, in the Uffizi\r\n    Gallery at Florence, painted by Alessandro Allori (1535-1607), and\r\n    believed to be a copy of an earlier portrait by Raphael.\r\n\r\n4.—Then my lord Magnifico, turning to my lady Duchess, said:\r\n\r\n“Since so it pleases you, my Lady, I will say what occurs to me, but\r\nwith very great fear of not satisfying. And in sooth it would be a far\r\nlighter task to describe a lady worthy to be queen of the world, than a\r\nperfect Court Lady: because of the latter I know not where to take my\r\nmodel; while for the queen I should not need to go far, and it would be\r\nenough for me to think of the divine accomplishments of a lady whom I\r\nknow,[337] and, lost in contemplation, to bend all my thoughts to\r\nexpress clearly in words that which many see with their eyes; and if I\r\ncould do no more, by merely naming her I should have performed my task.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“Do not wander from your subject, my lord Magnifico, but hold to the\r\norder given you and describe the Court Lady, to the end that so noble a\r\nLady as this may have someone competent to serve her worthily.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico continued:\r\n\r\n“Then, my Lady, to show that your commands have power to induce me to\r\nessay even that which I know not how to do, I will speak of this\r\nexcellent Lady as I would have her; and when I have fashioned her to my\r\nliking, not being able then to have another such, like Pygmalion I will\r\ntake her for my own.[338]\r\n\r\n“And although my lord Gaspar has said that the same rules which are set\r\nthe Courtier, serve also for the Lady, I am of another mind; for while\r\nsome qualities are common to both and as necessary to man as to woman,\r\nthere are nevertheless some others that befit woman more than man, and\r\nsome are befitting man to which she ought to be wholly a stranger. The\r\nsame I say of bodily exercises; but above all, methinks that in her\r\nways, manners, words, gestures and bearing, a woman ought to be very\r\nunlike a man; for just as it befits him to show a certain stout and\r\nsturdy manliness, so it is becoming in a woman to have a soft and dainty\r\ntenderness with an air of womanly sweetness in her every movement,\r\nwhich, in her going or staying or saying what you will, shall always\r\nmake her seem the woman, without any likeness of a man.\r\n\r\n“Now, if this precept be added to the rules that these gentlemen have\r\ntaught the Courtier, I certainly think she ought to be able to profit by\r\nmany of them, and to adorn herself with admirable accomplishments, as my\r\nlord Gaspar says. For I believe that many faculties of the mind are as\r\nnecessary to woman as to man; likewise gentle birth, to avoid\r\naffectation, to be naturally graceful in all her doings, to be mannerly,\r\nclever, prudent, not arrogant, not envious, not slanderous, not vain,\r\nnot quarrelsome, not silly, to know how to win and keep the favour of\r\nher mistress and of all others, to practise well and gracefully the\r\nexercises that befit women. I am quite of the opinion, too, that beauty\r\nis more necessary to her than to the Courtier, for in truth that woman\r\nlacks much who lacks beauty. Then, too, she ought to be more circumspect\r\nand take greater care not to give occasion for evil being said of her,\r\nand so to act that she may not only escape a stain of guilt but even of\r\nsuspicion, for a woman has not so many ways of defending herself against\r\nfalse imputations as has a man.\r\n\r\n“But as Count Ludovico has explained very minutely the chief profession\r\nof the Courtier, and has insisted it be that of arms, methinks it is\r\nalso fitting to tell what in my judgment is that of the Court Lady: and\r\nwhen I have done this, I shall think myself quit of the greater part of\r\nmy duty.\r\n\r\n5.—“Laying aside, then, those faculties of the mind that she ought to\r\nhave in common with the Courtier (such as prudence, magnanimity,\r\ncontinence, and many others), and likewise those qualities that befit\r\nall women (such as kindness, discretion, ability to manage her husband’s\r\nproperty and her house and children if she be married, and all those\r\ncapacities that are requisite in a good housewife), I say that in a lady\r\nwho lives at court methinks above all else a certain pleasant affability\r\nis befitting, whereby she may be able to entertain politely every sort\r\nof man with agreeable and seemly converse, suited to the time and place,\r\nand to the rank of the person with whom she may speak, uniting with calm\r\nand modest manners, and with that seemliness which should ever dispose\r\nall her actions, a quick vivacity of spirit whereby she may show herself\r\nalien to all indelicacy; but with such a kindly manner as shall make us\r\nthink her no less chaste, prudent and benign, than agreeable, witty and\r\ndiscreet: and so she must preserve a certain mean (difficult and\r\ncomposed almost of contraries), and must barely touch certain limits but\r\nnot pass them.\r\n\r\n“Thus, in her wish to be thought good and pure, the Lady ought not to be\r\nso coy and seem so to abhor company and talk that are a little free, as\r\nto take her leave as soon as she finds herself therein; for it might\r\neasily be thought that she was pretending to be thus austere in order to\r\nhide something about herself which she feared others might come to know;\r\nand such prudish manners are always odious. Nor ought she, on the other\r\nhand, for the sake of showing herself free and agreeable, to utter\r\nunseemly words or practise a certain wild and unbridled familiarity and\r\nways likely to make that believed of her which perhaps is not true; but\r\nwhen she is present at such talk, she ought to listen with a little\r\nblush and shame.\r\n\r\n“Likewise she ought to avoid an errour into which I have seen many women\r\nfall, which is that of saying and of willingly listening to evil about\r\nother women. For those women who, on hearing the unseemly ways of other\r\nwomen described, grow angry thereat and seem to disbelieve it and to\r\nregard it almost monstrous that a woman should be immodest,—they, by\r\naccounting the offence so heinous, give reason to think that they do not\r\ncommit it. But those who go about continually prying into other women’s\r\nintrigues, and narrate them so minutely and with such zest, seem to be\r\nenvious of them and to wish that everyone may know it, to the end that\r\nlike matters may not be reckoned as a fault in their own case; and thus\r\nthey fall into certain laughs and ways that show they then feel greatest\r\npleasure. And hence it comes that men, while seeming to listen gladly,\r\nusually hold such women in small respect and have very little regard for\r\nthem, and think these ways of theirs are an invitation to advance\r\nfarther, and thus often go such lengths with them as bring them deserved\r\nreproach, and finally esteem them so lightly as to despise their company\r\nand even find them tedious.\r\n\r\n“And on the other hand, there is no man so shameless and insolent as not\r\nto have reverence for those women who are esteemed good and virtuous;\r\nbecause this gravity (tempered with wisdom and goodness) is as it were a\r\nshield against the insolence and coarseness of the presumptuous. Thus we\r\nsee that a word or laugh or act of kindness (however small it be) from a\r\nvirtuous woman is more prized by everyone, than all the endearments and\r\ncaresses of those who show their lack of shame so openly; and if they\r\nare not immodest, by their unseemly laughter, their loquacity, insolence\r\nand like scurrile manners, they give sign of being so.\r\n\r\n6.—“And since words that carry no meaning of importance are vain and\r\npuerile, the Court Lady must have not only the good sense to discern the\r\nquality of him with whom she is speaking, but knowledge of many things,\r\nin order to entertain him graciously; and in her talk she should know\r\nhow to choose those things that are adapted to the quality of him with\r\nwhom she is speaking, and should be cautious lest occasionally, without\r\nintending it, she utter words that may offend him. Let her guard against\r\nwearying him by praising herself indiscreetly or by being too prolix.\r\nLet her not go about mingling serious matters with her playful or\r\nhumourous discourse, or jests and jokes with her serious discourse. Let\r\nher not stupidly pretend to know that which she does not know, but\r\nmodestly seek to do herself credit in that which she does know,—in all\r\nthings avoiding affectation, as has been said. In this way she will be\r\nadorned with good manners, and will perform with perfect grace the\r\nbodily exercises proper to women; her discourse will be rich and full of\r\nprudence, virtue and pleasantness; and thus she will be not only loved\r\nbut revered by everyone, and perhaps worthy to be placed side by side\r\nwith this great Courtier as well in qualities of the mind as in those of\r\nthe body.”\r\n\r\n7.—Having so far spoken, the Magnifico was silent and sat quiet, as if\r\nhe had ended his discourse. Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Verily, my lord Magnifico, you have adorned this Lady well and given\r\nher excellent qualities. Yet methinks you have kept much to\r\ngeneralities, and mentioned some things in her so great that I think you\r\nwere ashamed to explain them, and have rather desired than taught them,\r\nafter the manner of those who sometimes wish for things impossible and\r\nbeyond nature. Therefore I would have you declare to us a little better\r\nwhat are the bodily exercises proper to a Court Lady, and in what way\r\nshe ought to converse, and what those many things are whereof you say it\r\nbefits her to have knowledge; and whether you mean that she should use\r\nthe prudence, the magnanimity, the continence, and the many other\r\nvirtues you have named, merely to aid her in the government of her\r\nhouse, children and family (which however you would not have her chief\r\nprofession), or indeed in her conversation and graceful practice of\r\nthose bodily exercises; and, by your faith, guard against setting these\r\npoor virtues to such menial duty that they must needs be ashamed of it.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Gaspar, you cannot help showing your ill will towards women.\r\nBut in truth I thought I had said enough, and especially before such\r\nhearers; for I am quite sure there is no one here who does not perceive\r\nthat in the matter of bodily exercises it does not befit women to handle\r\nweapons, to ride, to play tennis, to wrestle, and to do many other\r\nthings that befit men.”\r\n\r\nThen the Unico Aretino said:\r\n\r\n“Among the ancients it was the custom for women to wrestle unclothed\r\nwith men; but we have lost this good custom, along with many others.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare Gonzaga added:\r\n\r\n“And in my time I have seen women play tennis, handle weapons, ride, go\r\nhunting, and perform nearly all the exercises that a cavalier can.”\r\n\r\n8.—The Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Since I may fashion this Lady as I wish, not only am I unwilling to\r\nhave her practise such vigourous and rugged manly exercises, but I would\r\nhave her practise even those that are becoming to women, circumspectly\r\nand with that gentle daintiness which we have said befits her; and thus\r\nin dancing I would not see her use too active and violent movements, nor\r\nin singing or playing those abrupt and oft-repeated diminutions which\r\nshow more skill than sweetness; likewise the musical instruments that\r\nshe uses ought, in my opinion, to be appropriate to this intent. Imagine\r\nhow unlovely it would be to see a woman play drums, fifes or trumpets,\r\nor other like instruments; and this because their harshness hides and\r\ndestroys that mild gentleness which so much adorns every act a woman\r\ndoes. Therefore when she starts to dance or make music of any kind, she\r\nought to bring herself to it by letting herself be urged a little, and\r\nwith a touch of shyness which shall show that noble shame which is the\r\nopposite of effrontery.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, she ought to adapt her dress to this intent, and so to clothe\r\nherself that she may not seem vain or frivolous. But since women may and\r\nought to take more care for beauty than men,—and there are divers sorts\r\nof beauty,—this Lady ought to have the good sense to discern what those\r\ngarments are that enhance her grace and are most appropriate to the\r\nexercises wherein she purposes to engage at the time, and to wear them.\r\nAnd if she is conscious of possessing a bright and cheerful beauty, she\r\nought to set it off with movements, words and dress all tending towards\r\nthe cheerful; so too, another, who feels that her style is gentle and\r\nserious, ought to accompany it with fashions of that sort, in order to\r\nenhance that which is the gift of nature. Thus, if she is a little more\r\nstout or thin than the medium, or fair or dark, let her seek help from\r\ndress, but as covertly as possible; and while keeping herself dainty and\r\nneat, let her always seem to give no thought or heed to it.\r\n\r\n9.—“And since my lord Gaspar further asks what these many things are\r\nwhereof she ought to have knowledge, and in what manner she ought to\r\nconverse, and whether her virtues ought to contribute to her\r\nconversation,—I say I would have her acquainted with that which these\r\ngentlemen wished the Courtier to know. And of the exercises that we have\r\nsaid do not befit her, I would have her at least possess such\r\nunderstanding as we may have of things that we do not practise; and this\r\nin order that she may know how to praise and value cavaliers more or\r\nless, according to their deserts.\r\n\r\n“And to repeat in a few words part of what has been already said, I wish\r\nthis Lady to have knowledge of letters, music, painting, and to know how\r\nto dance and make merry; accompanying the other precepts that have been\r\ntaught the Courtier with discreet modesty and with the giving of a good\r\nimpression of herself. And thus, in her talk, her laughter, her play,\r\nher jesting, in short, in everything, she will be very graceful, and\r\nwill entertain appropriately, and with witticisms and pleasantries\r\nbefitting her, everyone who shall come before her. And although\r\ncontinence, magnanimity, temperance, strength of mind, prudence, and the\r\nother virtues, seem to have little to do with entertainment, I would\r\nhave her adorned with all of them, not so much for the sake of\r\nentertainment (albeit even there they can be of service), as in order\r\nthat she may be full of virtue, and to the end that these virtues may\r\nrender her worthy of being honoured, and that her every act may be\r\ngoverned by them.”\r\n\r\n10.—My lord Gaspar then said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Since you have given women letters and continence and magnanimity and\r\ntemperance, I only marvel that you would not also have them govern\r\ncities, make laws, and lead armies, and let the men stay at home to cook\r\nor spin.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied, also laughing:\r\n\r\n“Perhaps even this would not be amiss.” Then he added: “Do you not know\r\nthat Plato, who certainly was no great friend to women, gave them charge\r\nover the city, and gave all other martial duties to the men?[339] Do you\r\nnot believe that there are many to be found who would know how to govern\r\ncities and armies as well as men do? But I have not laid these duties on\r\nthem, because I am fashioning a Court Lady and not a Queen.\r\n\r\n“I well know you would like to repeat tacitly that false imputation\r\nwhich my lord Ottaviano cast on women yesterday: namely, that they are\r\nvery imperfect creatures, incapable of doing any good act, and of very\r\nlittle worth and no dignity by comparison with men: but in truth both he\r\nand you would be greatly in the wrong if you were to think this.”\r\n\r\n11.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to repeat things already said; but you would fain lead me\r\nto say something to offend these ladies’ feelings in order to make them\r\nmy enemies, just as you wish to win their favour by flattering them\r\nfalsely. But they are so much above other women in discretion that they\r\nlove truth (even if it be little in their favour) more than false\r\npraises; nor do they take it amiss if anyone says that men are of\r\ngreater dignity, and will admit that you have recounted great miracles\r\nand ascribed to the Court Lady certain absurd impossibilities, and so\r\nmany virtues that Socrates and Cato and all the philosophers in the\r\nworld are as nothing by comparison. To tell the plain truth, I marvel\r\nthat you were not ashamed to go so far beyond bounds; for it ought to\r\nhave been quite enough for you to make this Court Lady beautiful,\r\ndiscreet, chaste, gracious, and able (without incurring infamy) to\r\nentertain with dancing, music, games, laughter, witticisms, and the\r\nother things which we see used at court every day. But to insist on\r\ngiving her knowledge of all the things in the world, and to attribute to\r\nher those virtues that are so rarely seen in men even in past centuries,\r\nis something that cannot be endured or hardly listened to.\r\n\r\n“Now, I am far from willing to affirm that women are imperfect\r\ncreatures, and consequently of less dignity than men, and not capable of\r\nthose virtues that men are,—because these ladies’ worth would suffice to\r\nprove me wrong:[340] but I do say that very learned men have left it in\r\nwriting that since nature always aims and designs to make things most\r\nperfect, she would continually bring forth men if she could; and when a\r\nwoman is born, it is a defect or mistake of nature, and contrary to that\r\nwhich she would wish to do: as is seen also in the case of one who is\r\nborn blind or halt or with some other defect; and in trees, many fruits\r\nthat never ripen. Thus woman may be said to be a creature produced by\r\nchance and accident; and that this is so, mark a man’s acts and a\r\nwoman’s, and judge therefrom the perfection of both. Yet, as these\r\nimperfections of women are the fault of nature who has made them so, we\r\nought not on that account to hate them or fail to show them that respect\r\nwhich is their due. But to esteem them above what they are, seems to me\r\nplain errour.”\r\n\r\n12.—The Magnifico Giuliano waited for my lord Gaspar to continue\r\nfurther, but seeing that he kept silent, said:\r\n\r\n“As to women’s imperfection, methinks you have adduced a very weak\r\nargument; to which, although perhaps it be not timely to enter upon\r\nthese subtleties now, I reply (according to the opinion of one who knows\r\nand according to truth) that the substance of anything you please cannot\r\nreceive into itself more or less. For just as no one stone can be more\r\nperfectly stone than another as regards the essence of a stone, nor one\r\npiece of wood more perfectly wood than another,—so one man cannot be\r\nmore perfectly man than another; and consequently the male will not be\r\nmore perfect than the female as regards its essential substance, because\r\nboth are included in the species man, and that wherein the one differs\r\nfrom the other is an accidental matter and not essential. In case you\r\nthen tell me that man is more perfect than woman, if not in essence, at\r\nleast in non-essentials, I reply that these non-essentials must pertain\r\neither to the body or to the mind; if to the body (as in that man is\r\nmore robust, more agile, lighter, or more capable of toil), I say that\r\nthis is proof of very slight perfection, because even among men, they\r\nwho have these qualities more than others have, are not more esteemed\r\ntherefor; and even in wars, where the greater part of the work is\r\nlaborious and a matter of strength, the strongest are yet not the most\r\nprized; if to the mind, I say that all the things that men can\r\nunderstand, the same can women understand too; and where the intellect\r\nof the one penetrates, there also can that of the other penetrate.”\r\n\r\n13.—Having here made a little pause, the Magnifico Giuliano added,\r\nlaughing:\r\n\r\n“Do you not know that in philosophy this proposition is maintained, that\r\nthose who are tender in flesh are apt in mind? So there is no doubt that\r\nwomen, being tenderer in flesh, are apter in mind, and of capacity\r\nbetter fitted for speculation than men are.” Then he continued:\r\n\r\n“But leaving this aside, since you have told me to argue concerning the\r\nperfection of both from their acts, I say that if you will consider the\r\nworkings of nature, you will find that she makes women what they are,\r\nnot by chance, but adapted to the necessary end: for although she makes\r\nthem not strong in body and of placid spirit, with many other qualities\r\nopposed to those of men, yet the characters of both tend to one single\r\nend conducive to the same use. For just as by reason of that feebleness\r\nof theirs women are less courageous, so for the same reason they are\r\nalso more cautious: thus the mother nourishes her children, the father\r\ninstructs them and with his strength earns abroad that which she with\r\nanxious care preserves at home, which is not the lesser merit.\r\n\r\n“Again, if you examine the ancient histories (albeit men have ever been\r\nvery chary of writing women’s praises) and the modern ones, you will\r\nfind that worth has continually existed among women as well as among\r\nmen; and that there have even been those who waged wars and won glorious\r\nvictories therein, governed kingdoms with the highest prudence and\r\njustice, and did everything that men have done. As for the sciences, do\r\nyou not remember having read of many women who were learned in\r\nphilosophy? Others who were very excellent in poetry? Others who\r\nconducted suits, and accused and defended most eloquently before judges?\r\nOf handicrafts it would be too long to tell, nor is there need to bring\r\nproof regarding that.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, if in essential substance man is not more perfect than\r\nwoman, nor in non-essentials either (and of this, quite apart from\r\nargument, the effects are seen), I do not know in what consists this\r\nperfection of his.\r\n\r\n14.—“And since you said that nature’s aim is always to bring forth the\r\nmost perfect things, and that she therefore would always bring forth man\r\nif she could, and that the bringing forth of woman is rather an errour\r\nor defect in nature than of purpose,—I reply that this is totally\r\ndenied; nor do I see how you can say that nature does not aim to bring\r\nforth women, without whom the human species cannot be preserved, whereof\r\nthis same nature is more desirous than of everything else. For by means\r\nof this union of male and female she brings forth children, who repay\r\nthe benefits received in childhood by maintaining their parents when\r\nold; then in turn they beget other children of their own, from whom they\r\nlook to receive in old age that which they in their youth bestowed upon\r\ntheir parents; thus nature, moving as it were in a circle, fills out\r\neternity and in this way grants immortality to mortals. Woman being\r\ntherefore as necessary in this as man, I do not see how the one was made\r\nmore by chance than the other.\r\n\r\n“It is very true that nature aims always to bring forth the most perfect\r\nthings, and hence means to bring forth man after his kind, but not male\r\nrather than female. Nay, if she were always to bring forth male, she\r\nwould be working imperfection; for just as from body and soul there\r\nresults a compound more noble than its parts, which is man,—so from the\r\nunion of male and female there results a compound which preserves the\r\nhuman species, and without which its members would perish. And hence\r\nmale and female are by nature always together, nor can the one exist\r\nwithout the other; thus that ought not to be called male which has no\r\nfemale, according to the definition of each; nor female, that which has\r\nno male. And as one sex alone shows imperfection, the theologians of old\r\nattribute both the one and the other to God:[341] wherefore Orpheus said\r\nthat Jove was male and female; and we read in Holy Writ that God formed\r\nmen male and female in his own likeness; and often the poets, speaking\r\nof the gods, confuse the sex.”\r\n\r\n15.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I would not have us enter upon such subtleties, because these ladies\r\nwill not understand us, and although I answer you with excellent\r\narguments, they will believe (or at least pretend to believe) that I am\r\nwrong, and straightway will pronounce judgment to their liking. Yet\r\nsince we are already begun, I will say merely this, that (as you know is\r\nthe opinion of very wise men) man resembles form, and woman matter; and\r\ntherefore, just as form is more perfect than matter,—nay, gives it its\r\nbeing,—so man is far more perfect than woman. And I remember having once\r\nheard that a great philosopher says in some of his problems:[342] ‘Why\r\nis it that a woman always naturally loves the man who first tasted the\r\nsweets of love with her? and on the contrary a man holds that woman in\r\nhatred who was the first to give herself to him?’ And adding the reason,\r\nhe affirms it to be this: because in this matter the woman receives\r\nperfection from the man, and the man imperfection from the woman; and\r\ntherefore everyone naturally loves that thing which makes him perfect,\r\nand hates that which makes him imperfect. And besides this, a great\r\nargument for the perfection of man and for the imperfection of woman is\r\nthat every woman universally desires to be a man, by a certain natural\r\ninstinct that teaches her to desire her perfection.”\r\n\r\n16.—The Magnifico Giuliano at once replied:\r\n\r\n“The poor creatures do not desire to be men in order to be perfect, but\r\nin order to have liberty and to escape that dominion over them which man\r\nhas arrogated to himself by his own authority. And the analogy that you\r\ncite of matter and form does not apply in everything; for woman is not\r\nmade perfect by man, as matter by form: because matter receives its\r\nbeing from form and cannot exist without it; nay, the more matter forms\r\nhave, the more they have of imperfection, and are most perfect when\r\nseparated from it. But woman does not receive her being from man; nay,\r\njust as she is made perfect by him, she also makes him perfect. Hence\r\nboth join in procreation, which neither of them can effect without the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I will assign the cause of woman’s lasting love for the first\r\nman to whom she has given herself, and of man’s hatred for the first\r\nwoman, not at all to that which your Philosopher alleges in his\r\nproblems, but to woman’s firmness and constancy, and to man’s\r\ninconstancy; nor without natural reason: for being warm, the male\r\nnaturally derives from that quality lightness, movement and inconstancy,\r\nwhile from her frigidity woman on the other hand derives quietness, firm\r\ngravity, and more fixed impressions.”\r\n\r\n17.—Then my lady Emilia turned to my lord Magnifico and said:\r\n\r\n“For the love of Heaven, leave these matters and forms of yours awhile,\r\nand male and female, and speak in such fashion that you may be\r\nunderstood; for we heard and understood very well the evil that my lord\r\nOttaviano and my lord Gaspar said of us, but now we do not at all\r\nunderstand in what manner you are defending us: so it seems to me that\r\nyou are straying from the subject and leaving in everyone’s mind that\r\nbad impression which these enemies of ours have given of us.”\r\n\r\n“Do not give us that name, my Lady,” replied my lord Gaspar, “for it\r\nbetter befits my lord Magnifico, who by bestowing false praises upon\r\nwomen shows that there are none true of them.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano continued:\r\n\r\n“Do not doubt, my Lady, that answer will be made to everything. But I do\r\nnot wish to utter such inordinate abuse of men as they have uttered of\r\nwomen; and if by chance there were anyone to write down our discussions,\r\nI should not like, in a place where these matters and forms are\r\nunderstood, to have the arguments and reasons that my lord Gaspar\r\nadduces against you, appear to have been without reply.”\r\n\r\n“I do not see, my lord Magnifico,” my lord Gaspar then said, “how in\r\nthis matter you will be able to deny that man is by his natural\r\nqualities more perfect than woman, who is frigid by temperament, and man\r\nwarm. And warmth is far nobler and more perfect than cold, because it is\r\nactive and productive; and, as you know, the heavens send down only\r\nwarmth upon us here, and not cold, which does not enter into the works\r\nof nature. And hence I believe that the frigidity of women’s temperament\r\nis the cause of their abasement and timidity.”\r\n\r\n18.—“So you too,” replied the Magnifico Giuliano, “wish to enter into\r\nsubtleties; but you shall see that you will always have the worst of it:\r\nand that this is true, listen.\r\n\r\n“I grant you that warmth is in itself more perfect than cold; but this\r\nis not the case with things mixed and composite; for if it were so, that\r\nbody which is warmer would be more perfect, which is false, because\r\ntemperate bodies are most perfect. Moreover, I tell you that woman is of\r\nfrigid temperament by comparison with man, who by excess of warmth is\r\nfar from temperate; but as for her, she is temperate (or at least more\r\nnearly temperate than man is) because she has in her a moisture\r\nproportioned to her natural warmth, which in man usually evaporates by\r\nreason of excessive dryness and is consumed. Furthermore, her coldness\r\nis of the kind that resists and moderates her natural warmth and makes\r\nit more nearly temperate; while in man the surplus warmth soon raises\r\nhis natural heat to the highest pitch, which wastes away for lack of\r\nsustenance. And thus, as men lose more in procreation than women do, it\r\noften happens that they are less long lived than women; wherefore this\r\nperfection also may be ascribed to women, that, living longer than men,\r\nthey perform better than men that which is the intent of nature.\r\n\r\n“Of the warmth that the heavens shed upon us I do not speak now, because\r\nit is of a different sort from that which we are discussing; for being\r\npreservative of all things under the moon’s orb, warm as well as cold,\r\nit cannot be hostile to cold. But timidity in women, although it shows\r\nsome imperfection, yet springs from a praiseworthy source, that is, from\r\nthe subtlety and readiness of their wits, which picture images to their\r\nminds quickly and thus are easily disturbed by things external. You will\r\nvery often see men who fear neither death nor anything else, and yet\r\ncannot be called courageous, because they do not know the danger and go\r\nlike fools where they see the road open, and think no further; and this\r\nproceeds from a certain grossness of dull wits: wherefore we cannot say\r\nthat a fool is brave. But true loftiness of mind comes from a due\r\ndeliberation and determined resolve to act thus and so, and from\r\nesteeming honour and duty above all the dangers in the world; and from\r\nbeing of such stout heart and courage (although death be manifest), that\r\nthe senses are not clogged or frightened, but perform their office in\r\nspeech and thought as if they were most quiet. We have seen and heard\r\nthat great men are of this sort; likewise many women, who both in\r\nancient and in modern times have displayed greatness of spirit and have\r\nwrought upon the world effects worthy of infinite praise, not less than\r\nmen have done.”\r\n\r\n19.—Then Frisio said:\r\n\r\n“These effects began when the first woman by her transgression led\r\nothers to transgress against God, and left the human race an heritage of\r\ndeath, sufferings, sorrows, and all the miseries and calamities that are\r\nfelt in the world to-day.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“Since you too are pleased to enter upon sacred things, do you not know\r\nthat this transgression was repaired by a Woman, who brought us much\r\ngreater gain than the other had done us injury, so that the guilt is\r\ncalled most fortunate which was atoned by such merits? But I do not now\r\nmean to tell you how inferior in dignity all human creatures are to our\r\nLady the Virgin (in order not to mingle things divine with these light\r\ndiscussions of ours); nor to recount how many women have, with infinite\r\nconstancy, suffered themselves to be cruelly slain by tyrants for\r\nChrist’s name, nor those who by learned disputation have confuted so\r\nmany idolaters. And if you told me that this was a miracle and grace of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, I say that no virtue merits more praise than that which\r\nis approved by the testimony of God. Many other women also, of whom\r\nthere is less talk, you yourself can see,—especially by reading Saint\r\nJerome, who celebrates certain ones of his time with such admiring\r\npraises as might well suffice for the saintliest man on earth.[343]\r\n\r\n20.—“Then consider how many others there have been, of whom no mention\r\nis made at all, because the poor creatures are kept shut up, without the\r\nlofty pride to seek the name of saint from the rabble, as many accursed\r\nhypocrites do to-day, who,—forgetful or rather regardless of Christ’s\r\nteaching, which requires that when a man fasts he shall anoint his face\r\nin order that he may not seem to fast, and commands that prayers, alms,\r\nand other good works shall be done, not in the market-place nor in\r\nsynagogues, but in secret, so that the left hand shall not know of the\r\nright,—affirm that there is no greater good thing in the world than to\r\ngive a good example: and so, with averted head and downcast eyes,\r\nnoising it abroad that they will not speak to women or eat anything but\r\nraw herbs,—dirty, with cassocks torn, they beguile the simple. Yet they\r\nabstain not from forging wills, setting mortal enmities between man and\r\nwife, and sometimes poison, using sorceries, incantations and every sort\r\nof villainy. And then they cite a certain authority out of their own\r\nhead, which says, _si non caste, tamen caute_;[344] and with this they\r\nthink to cure every great evil, and with good arguments to persuade\r\nanyone who is not right wary that all sin, however grave it be, is\r\neasily pardoned of God, provided it remain secret and do not give rise\r\nto bad example. Thus, under a veil of sanctity and in secret they often\r\nturn all their thoughts to corrupt the pure mind of some woman; often to\r\nsow hatred between brothers; to govern states; to raise up one and cast\r\nanother down; to get men beheaded, imprisoned and proscribed; to be\r\nministers of the villainies and as it were receivers of the thefts that\r\nmany princes commit.\r\n\r\n“Others shamelessly delight to appear dainty and fresh, with well-shaven\r\ncrown and garments fine, and in walking lift the cassock to display\r\ntheir neat hose and their comeliness of person in making salutations.\r\nOthers use certain glances and gestures even in saying mass, whereby\r\nthey imagine they are graceful and attract attention. Villainous and\r\nwicked men, utter strangers not only to religion but to all good\r\nbehaviour; and when they are reproved for their loose living, they make\r\na jest of it and laugh at him who speaks to them of it, and almost make\r\na merit of their vices.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“You take such pleasure in speaking ill of friars, that you have entered\r\nupon this subject without rhyme or reason. But you are very wrong to\r\nmurmur against ecclesiastics, and you burden your conscience quite\r\nneedlessly; since, but for those who pray to God for us, we should have\r\nmuch greater scourges than we have.”\r\n\r\nThen the Magnifico Giuliano laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“How did you guess so well, my Lady, that I was speaking of friars, when\r\nI did not name them? But in truth what I do is not called murmuring, for\r\nI speak very openly and plainly; nor am I speaking of the good, but of\r\nthe bad and guilty, of whom moreover I do not tell the thousandth part\r\nof what I know.”\r\n\r\n“Do not speak of friars now,” replied my lady Emilia; “because for my\r\npart I esteem it grievous sin to listen to you, and so I shall go away\r\nin order not to listen to you.”\r\n\r\n21.—“I am content,” said the Magnifico Giuliano, “to speak no more of\r\nthis; but returning to the praises of women, I say that my lord Gaspar\r\nshall not find me an admirable man, but I will find you a wife or\r\ndaughter or sister of equal and sometimes greater merit. Moreover, many\r\nwomen have been the cause of countless benefits to their men-folk, and\r\nsometimes have corrected many a one of his errours. Wherefore, women\r\nbeing (as we have shown) naturally capable of the same virtues as men,\r\nand the effects thereof being often seen, I do not perceive why,—in\r\ngiving them what it is possible for them to have, what they more than\r\nonce have had and still have,—I should be regarded as relating miracles,\r\nwhereof my lord Gaspar has accused me; seeing that there have always\r\nbeen on earth, and now still are, women as like the Court Lady I have\r\nfashioned, as men like the man these gentlemen have fashioned.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Those arguments that have experience against them do not seem to me\r\ngood; and certainly if I were to ask you who these great women were that\r\nhave been as worthy of praise as the great men whose wives or sisters or\r\ndaughters they were, or that have been the cause of any benefit, and who\r\nthose were that have corrected the errours of their men-folk,—I think\r\nyou would be embarrassed.”\r\n\r\n22.—“Verily,” replied the Magnifico Giuliano, “no other thing could make\r\nme embarrassed save their multitude; and had I time enough, I should\r\ntell you here the story of Octavia,[345] wife of Mark Antony and sister\r\nof Augustus; that of Porcia,[346] Cato’s daughter and wife of Brutus;\r\nthat of Caia Cæcilia,[347] wife of Tarquinius Priscus; that of\r\nCornelia,[348] Scipio’s daughter; and of countless others who are very\r\ncelebrated: and not only of our own, but of barbarian nations; as that\r\nof Alexandra,[349] wife of Alexander king of the Jews, who,—after her\r\nhusband’s death, when she saw the people kindled with fury and already\r\nup in arms to slay the two children that he had left her, in revenge for\r\nthe cruel and grievous bondage in which the father had always kept\r\nthem,—so acted that she soon appeased their just wrath, and by her\r\nprudence straightway won over for her children those minds which the\r\nfather, by countless injuries during many years, had made very hostile\r\nto his offspring.”\r\n\r\n“At least tell us,” replied my lady Emilia, “how she did it.”\r\n\r\n“Seeing her children in such peril,” said the Magnifico, “she at once\r\ncaused Alexander’s body to be cast into the middle of the market-place.\r\nThen, having called the citizens to her, she said that she knew their\r\nminds to be kindled with very just wrath against her husband, because\r\nthe cruel injuries that he had iniquitously done them deserved it; and\r\nthat, as she had always wished, while he was alive, that she could make\r\nhim abstain from such a wicked life, so now she was ready to give proof\r\nof it, and as far as possible to help them punish him after death; and\r\ntherefore let them take his body, and give it as food for dogs, and\r\noutrage it in the most cruel ways they could devise: but she prayed them\r\nto have mercy upon her innocent children, who could not have either\r\nguilt or even knowledge of the father’s evil deeds. Of such efficacy\r\nwere these words, that the fierce wrath before conceived in the minds of\r\nall that people was quickly softened and turned to a feeling of such\r\npity, that they not only with one accord chose the children for their\r\nrulers, but also gave most honourable burial to the body of the dead.”\r\n\r\nHere the Magnifico made a little pause; then he added:\r\n\r\n“Do you not know that the wife and daughters of Mithridates showed much\r\nless fear of death than Mithridates?[350] And Hasdrubal’s wife than\r\nHasdrubal?[351] Do you not know that Harmonia, daughter of Hiero the\r\nSyracusan, chose to perish in the burning of her native city?”[352]\r\n\r\nThen Frisio said:\r\n\r\n“Where obstinacy is concerned, it is certain that some women are\r\noccasionally to be found who never change their purpose; like the one\r\nwho being no longer able to say ‘Scissors’ to her husband, made the sign\r\nof them to him with her hands.”[353]\r\n\r\n23.—The Magnifico Giuliano laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“Obstinacy that tends to a worthy end ought to be called steadfastness;\r\nas was the case of the famous Epicharis, a Roman freedwoman, who, being\r\nprivy to a great conspiracy against Nero, was of such steadfastness\r\nthat, although racked by all the direst tortures that can be imagined,\r\nshe never betrayed one of her accomplices; while in the same peril many\r\nnoble knights and senators basely accused brothers, friends and the\r\ndearest and nearest they had in the world.[354]\r\n\r\n“What will you say of that other woman who was called Leæna? In whose\r\nhonour the Athenians dedicated a tongueless lioness (_leæna_) in bronze\r\nbefore the gate of the citadel, to show in her the steadfast virtue of\r\nsilence; because being likewise privy to a conspiracy against the\r\ntyrants, she was not dismayed by the death of two great men (her\r\nfriends), and although rent by countless most cruel tortures, she never\r\nbetrayed one of the conspirators.”[355]\r\n\r\nThen madonna Margarita Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks you narrate too briefly these virtuous deeds done by women;\r\nfor these enemies of ours, although having heard and read them, yet\r\npretend not to know them and fain would have the memory of them lost:\r\nbut if you will let us women hear them, we at least shall deem ourselves\r\nhonoured by them.”\r\n\r\n24.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“So be it. I wish to tell you now of one who did what I think my lord\r\nGaspar himself will admit very few men do;” and he began: “In\r\nMassilia[356] there was once a custom that is believed to have been\r\nbrought from Greece, which was that they publicly[357] kept a poison\r\ncompounded of hemlock, and allowed anyone to take it who proved to the\r\nSenate that he ought to lay down his life because of any trouble that he\r\nfound therein, or for other just cause, to the end that whoever had\r\nsuffered a too hostile fortune or had enjoyed a too prosperous fortune,\r\nshould not drag on the one or change the other. Now Sextus Pompey,\r\nfinding himself—”[358]\r\n\r\nHere Frisio, not waiting for the Magnifico Giuliano to go on, said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks this is the beginning of a long story.”\r\n\r\nThen the Magnifico Giuliano turned to madonna Margarita laughing, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“You see that Frisio will not let me speak. I wished to tell you now\r\nabout a woman who, having shown to the Senate that she had good reason\r\nto die, cheerfully and fearlessly took the poison in Sextus Pompey’s\r\npresence, with such steadfastness of spirit and with such affectionate\r\nand thoughtful remembrances to her family, that Pompey and all the\r\nothers who saw such wisdom and confidence on a woman’s part in the dread\r\nhour of death, were lost in wonderment and tears.”\r\n\r\n25.—Then my lord Gaspar said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“I too remember having read a speech in which an unhappy husband asks\r\nleave of the Senate to die, and proves that he has just cause for it in\r\nthat he cannot endure the continual annoyance of his wife’s chatter, and\r\nprefers to drink the poison, which you say was publicly kept for such\r\npurposes, than his wife’s words.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“How many poor women would have just cause for asking leave to die\r\nbecause they cannot endure, I will not say the evil words, but the very\r\nevil deeds of their husbands! I know several such, who suffer in this\r\nworld the pains that are said to be in hell.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not believe,” replied my lord Gaspar, “that there are also many\r\nhusbands who have such torment of their wives that they hourly wish for\r\ndeath?”\r\n\r\n“And what pain,” said the Magnifico, “can wives give their husbands that\r\nis as incurable as are those that husbands give their wives?—who if not\r\nfor love, at least for fear, are submissive to their husbands.”\r\n\r\n“Certain it is,” said my lord Gaspar, “that the little good they\r\nsometimes do proceeds from fear, since there are few in the world who in\r\ntheir secret hearts do not hate their husbands.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, quite the contrary,” replied the Magnifico; “and if you recall\r\naright what you have read, we see in all the histories that wives nearly\r\nalways love their husbands more than husbands love their wives. When did\r\nyou ever see or read of a husband showing his wife such a token of love\r\nas did the famous Camma to her husband?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” replied my lord Gaspar, “who the woman was, nor what\r\ntoken she showed.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” said Frisio.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” replied the Magnifico; “and do you, madonna Margarita, take\r\ncare to keep it in mind.\r\n\r\n26.—“This Camma was a very beautiful young woman, adorned with such\r\nmodesty and gentle manners that she was admirable no less for this than\r\nfor her beauty; and above other things with all her heart she loved her\r\nhusband, who was called Synattus. It happened that another gentleman,\r\nwho was of much higher station than Synattus and almost tyrant of the\r\ncity where they lived, became enamoured of this young woman; and after\r\nhaving long tried by every way and means to possess her, and all in\r\nvain, he persuaded himself that the love she bore her husband was the\r\nsole cause that hindered his desires, and had this Synattus slain.\r\n\r\n“So then urging her continually, he was never able to gain other\r\nadvantage than he had done at first; wherefore, his love increasing\r\ndaily, he resolved to take her for his wife, although she was far\r\nbeneath him in station. So, her parents being asked by Sinoris (for thus\r\nthe lover was called), they began to persuade her to accept him, showing\r\nher that her consent would be very advantageous, and her refusal\r\ndangerous to her and to them all. After resisting them awhile, she at\r\nlast replied that she was willing.\r\n\r\n“Her parents had the news brought to Sinoris, who was happy beyond\r\nmeasure and arranged that the marriage should be celebrated at once.\r\nBoth having accordingly come in state for the purpose to the temple of\r\nDiana, Camma had a certain sweet drink brought which she had prepared;\r\nand so before Diana’s image she drank half of it in the presence of\r\nSinoris; then with her own hand (for thus it was the custom to do at\r\nmarriages) she gave the rest to her spouse, who drank it all.\r\n\r\n“When Camma saw that her plan had succeeded, she knelt all joyful at the\r\nfoot of Diana’s image, and said:\r\n\r\n“‘O Goddess, thou who knowest the secrets of my heart, be thou sure\r\nwitness for me how hardly I refrained from putting myself to death after\r\nmy dear consort died, and with what weariness I bore the sorrow of\r\nremaining in this bitter life, wherein I felt no other good or pleasure\r\nbeyond the hope of that vengeance which now I find I have attained.\r\nJoyful and content, then, I go to seek the sweet company of that soul\r\nwhich in life and in death I have loved more than myself. And thou,\r\nwretch, who thoughtest to be my husband, instead of the marriage bed\r\ngive order that thy tomb be made ready for thee, for I offer thee as a\r\nsacrifice to the shade of Synattus.’\r\n\r\n“Aghast at these words, and already feeling the effect of the poison\r\nstir pain within him, Sinoris tried many remedies; but they were of no\r\navail, and Camma had such great good fortune (or whatever else it was),\r\nthat before dying herself she knew that Sinoris was dead. Learning which\r\nthing, she very contentedly laid herself upon her bed with eyes to\r\nheaven, continually calling the name of Synattus, and saying:\r\n\r\n“‘O sweetest consort, now that I have given both tears and vengeance as\r\nlast offerings for thy death, nor see that aught else is left me to do\r\nfor thee, I hasten from the world and this life,—cruel without thee and\r\nonce dear to me only for thy sake. Come then to meet me, my Lord, and\r\nreceive this soul as gladly as it gladly comes to thee.’\r\n\r\n“And speaking thus, and with arms opened as if she would already embrace\r\nhim, she died. Now say, Frisio, what do you think of her?”[359]\r\n\r\nFrisio replied:\r\n\r\n“I think you fain would make these ladies weep. But even supposing this\r\nwere true, I tell you that such women are no longer to be found in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n27.—“Indeed they are to be found,” said the Magnifico; “and that this is\r\ntrue, listen:\r\n\r\n“In my time there was a gentleman at Pisa, whose name was messer\r\nTommaso; I do not remember of what family, although I often heard it\r\nmentioned by my father, who was a great friend of his. Now this messer\r\nTommaso, crossing one day in a small vessel from Pisa to Sicily on\r\nbusiness, was surprised by some Moorish galleys which had come up so\r\nstealthily that those who commanded the vessel did not suspect it; and\r\nalthough the men who were in her defended themselves stoutly, yet as\r\nthey were few and the enemy many, the vessel fell into the hands of the\r\nMoors, together with all who were in her, both wounded and whole as it\r\nchanced, and among them messer Tommaso, who had carried himself bravely\r\nand slain with his own hand a brother of one of the captains of the\r\ngalleys. Wherefore enraged, as you may believe, by the loss of a\r\nbrother, the captain claimed him as special prisoner, and beating and\r\nmaltreating him every day, carried him to Barbary, having resolved to\r\nkeep him there in great misery a captive for life and with grievous\r\npains.\r\n\r\n“All the others got free after a time, some in one way and some in\r\nanother, and returned home and reported to his wife (whose name was\r\nmadonna Argentina) and to his children, the hard life and sore\r\naffliction in which messer Tommaso was living and was like to go on\r\nliving without hope unless God should aid him miraculously. After she\r\nand they were informed of this and had tried several other means to\r\ndeliver him, and when he himself was quite resigned to die, it came to\r\npass that watchful love so kindled the wit and daring of one of his\r\nsons, who was called Paolo, that the youth took no heed of any kind of\r\ndanger and resolved either to die or to free his father; and this thing\r\nwas brought about in such sort that the father was conveyed away so\r\nprivily that he was in Leghorn before it was discovered in Barbary that\r\nhe had departed thence. From here messer Tommaso wrote in safety to his\r\nwife, and informed her of his deliverance and where he was and how he\r\nhoped to see her the next day. Overwhelmed with great and unexpected joy\r\nat being (through the dutifulness and merit of her son) so soon to see\r\nher husband, whom she so dearly loved and firmly believed she would\r\nnever see again,—the good and gentle lady raised her eyes to heaven when\r\nshe had read the letter, and calling her husband’s name fell dead upon\r\nthe ground; nor in spite of all the remedies that were employed upon her\r\ndid the departed spirit return again to her body. Cruel spectacle, and\r\nenough to moderate human wishes and restrain their over-longing for too\r\nmuch joy.”\r\n\r\n28.—Then Frisio said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“How do you know that she did not die of grief at hearing that her\r\nhusband was coming home?”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Because the rest of her life did not comport with this; nay, I think\r\nthat her soul, unable to brook delay in seeing him with the eyes of her\r\nbody, forsook it, and, drawn by eagerness, quickly flew whither her\r\nthought had flown on reading the letter.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“It may be that this lady was too loving, for women always run to\r\nextremes in everything, which is bad; and you see that by being too\r\nloving she wrought evil to herself, and to her husband and children, for\r\nwhom she turned to bitterness the joy of his perilous and longed-for\r\ndeliverance. So you ought by no means to cite her as one of those women\r\nwho have been the cause of such great benefits.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“I cite her as one of those who bear witness that there are wives who\r\nlove their husbands; for of those who have been the cause of great\r\nbenefits to the world, I could tell you of an endless number, and\r\ndiscourse to you of some so ancient that they almost seem fabulous, and\r\nof those who among men have been the inventors of such things, that they\r\ndeserved to be esteemed as goddesses, like Pallas and Ceres; and of the\r\nSibyls,[360] by whose mouth God has so often spoken and revealed to the\r\nworld events that were to come; and of those who have instructed very\r\ngreat men, like Aspasia,[361] and like Diotima,[362] who furthermore by\r\nher sacrifices delayed for ten years the time of a pestilence that was\r\nto come upon Athens. I could tell you of Nicostrate,[363] Evander’s\r\nmother, who taught the Latins letters; and of still another woman,[364]\r\nwho was preceptress to the lyric poet Pindar;[365] and of Corinna[366]\r\nand of Sappho,[367] who were excellent in poetry; but I do not wish to\r\nseek out matters so far afield. I tell you, however (leaving the rest\r\napart), that women were perhaps not less the cause of Rome’s greatness\r\nthan men.”\r\n\r\n“This,” said my lord Gaspar, “would be fine to hear.”\r\n\r\n29.—The Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Then listen to it. After the fall of Troy many Trojans fled who escaped\r\nthat great disaster, some in one direction and some in another; of whom\r\none part, who were buffeted by many storms, came to Italy at that place\r\nwhere the Tiber flows into the sea. Landing here in search of\r\nnecessaries, they began to roam about the country: the women, who had\r\nremained in the ships, bethought themselves of a good plan that would\r\nput an end to their perilous and long wandering by sea and give them a\r\nnew fatherland in place of that which they had lost; and after\r\nconsulting together in the absence of the men, they burned the ships;\r\nand the first to begin the work bore the name Roma. Yet fearing the\r\nwrath of the men, who were returning, they went out to meet these; and\r\nembracing and kissing, some their husbands, some their kinsmen, with\r\ntokens of affection, they softened the first impulse of anger; then they\r\nquietly explained to the men the reason of their wise device. Whereupon\r\nthe Trojans, either from necessity or from having been kindly received\r\nby the natives, were well pleased with what the women had done, and\r\ndwelt there with the Latins in the place where afterwards was Rome; and\r\nfrom this arose the ancient custom among the Romans that the women\r\nkissed their kinsfolk when they met.[368] Now you see how much these\r\nwomen helped to make a beginning of Rome.\r\n\r\n30.—“Nor did the Sabine women contribute less to its increase than the\r\nTrojan women did to its beginning. For Romulus, having excited general\r\nenmity among all his neighbours by the seizure of their women, was\r\nharassed by wars on every side; which (he being a man of ability) were\r\nsoon brought to a successful issue, except that with the Sabines, which\r\nwas very great because Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, was very\r\npowerful and wise. Wherefore, a severe conflict having taken place\r\nbetween Romans and Sabines, with very heavy loss on both sides, and a\r\nnew and cruel battle making ready, the Sabine women,—clad in black, with\r\nhair loose and torn, weeping, sorrowful, fearless of the weapons that\r\nwere already drawn to strike,—rushed in between the fathers and\r\nhusbands, imploring them to refrain from defiling their hands with the\r\nblood of fathers-in-law and sons-in-law. And if the men were still\r\ndispleased with the alliance, let the weapons be turned against the\r\nwomen, for it were better for them to die than to live widowed or\r\nfatherless and brotherless, and to remember that their children were\r\nbegotten of those who had slain their fathers, or that they themselves\r\nwere born of those who had slain their husbands. Lamenting thus and\r\nweeping, many of them carried their little babes in their arms,[369]\r\nsome of whom were already beginning to loose the tongue and seemed to\r\ntry to call and to make merry with their grandsires; to whom the women\r\nshowed the little ones, and said, weeping: ‘Behold your blood, which\r\nwith such heat and fury you are seeking to shed with your own hands.’\r\n\r\n“The women’s dutifulness and wisdom wrought such great effect at this\r\npass, that not only were lasting friendship and union established\r\nbetween the two hostile kings, but what was stranger, the Sabines came\r\nto live at Rome, and of the two peoples a single one was made. And thus\r\nthis union greatly increased the power of Rome, thanks to those wise and\r\nlofty-minded women, who were rewarded by Romulus in such fashion that in\r\ndividing the people into thirty wards he gave thereto the names of the\r\nSabine women.”\r\n\r\n31.—Here having paused a little, and seeing that my lord Gaspar did not\r\nspeak, the Magnifico Giuliano said:\r\n\r\n“Do you not think that these women were the cause of good to their\r\nmen-folk and contributed to the greatness of Rome?”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“No doubt they were worthy of much praise; but had you been as willing\r\nto tell the sins of women as their good works, you would not have\r\nomitted to say that in this war of Titus Tatius a woman betrayed Rome\r\nand showed the enemy the way to seize the Capitol, whereby the Romans\r\ncame near being all destroyed.”[370]\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“You tell me of a single bad woman, while I tell you of countless good\r\nones; and besides those already mentioned, I could show you a thousand\r\nother instances on my side, of benefits done to Rome by women, and could\r\ntell you why a temple was dedicated of old to Venus Armata,[371] and\r\nanother to Venus Calva,[372] and how the Festival of the Handmaidens was\r\ninstituted in honour of Juno because handmaidens once delivered Rome\r\nfrom the wiles of the enemy.[373] But leaving all these things aside,\r\ndid not that lofty deed—the discovery of Cataline’s conspiracy, whereof\r\nCicero so vaunts himself—spring chiefly from a vile woman?[374]—who for\r\nthis might be said to have been the cause of all the good that Cicero\r\nboasts of having wrought the Roman commonwealth. And had I time enough,\r\nI should further show you that women have often corrected many of men’s\r\nerrours; but I fear that this discourse of mine is already too long and\r\nwearisome: so, having performed according to my ability the task imposed\r\nupon me by these ladies, I think it well to give place to someone who\r\nwill say things worthier to be listened to than any I can say.”\r\n\r\n32.—Then my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“Do not deprive women of those true praises that are their due; and\r\nremember that if my lord Gaspar, and perhaps my lord Ottaviano as well,\r\nlisten to you with weariness, we and all these other gentlemen listen to\r\nyou with pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico still wished to stop, but all the ladies began begging him\r\nto speak: whereupon he said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“In order not to make my lord Gaspar more my enemy than he is, I will\r\ntell briefly of a few women who occur to my mind, omitting many that I\r\nmight mention.” Then he continued: “When Philip, son of Demetrius, was\r\nlaying siege to the city of Chios, he issued an edict promising freedom\r\nand their masters’ wives to all slaves who should escape from the city\r\nand come to him. So great was the women’s wrath at this shameful edict\r\nthat they rushed to the walls in arms, and fought so fiercely that in a\r\nshort time they drove Philip off with disgrace and loss: which their\r\nhusbands had not been able to do.[375]\r\n\r\n“When these same women came to Leuconia with their husbands, fathers and\r\nbrothers (who were going into exile), they performed a deed no less\r\nglorious than this: the Erythræans,[376] who were there with their\r\nallies, waged war upon these Chiotes, who were unable to resist, and so\r\nbound themselves to quit the city in tunic and shift only. Hearing of\r\nthis shameful bargain, the women bewailed and upbraided the men for\r\nabandoning their weapons and going forth almost naked among the enemy;\r\nand the men answering that they were already bound, the women told them\r\nto wear their shields and spears and leave their clothes behind, and to\r\ntell the enemy that this was their attire. And thus, acting upon the\r\nadvice of their women, they in great part atoned for the shame that they\r\ncould not wholly escape.\r\n\r\n“Again, Cyrus having routed an army of Persians in battle, in fleeing to\r\ntheir city they met their women outside the gate, who, stopping in the\r\nway, said: ‘Whither do ye flee, base men? Would ye perchance hide\r\nyourselves in us, from whence ye came?’ On hearing these and other like\r\nwords, and being sensible how inferior they were in courage to their\r\nwomen, the men were ashamed, and returning against the enemy, fought\r\nwith him anew and routed him.”[377]\r\n\r\n33.—Having thus far spoken, the Magnifico stopped, and turning to my\r\nlady Duchess, said:\r\n\r\n“Now, my Lady, you will give me leave to be silent.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“You will forsooth have to be silent, for you do not know what more to\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“You provoke me so, that you run risk of having to listen to women’s\r\npraises all night; and to hear of many Spartan women who rejoiced in the\r\nglorious death of their children;[378] and of those who disowned or even\r\nslew theirs when seen to behave basely. Then how in the ruin of their\r\ncountry the Saguntine women took up arms against the forces of\r\nHannibal;[379] and how, when Marius overcame the army of the Germans,\r\nthe women, being unable to get leave to live free at Rome in the service\r\nof the Vestal Virgins, all killed themselves and their little\r\nchildren;[380] and of a thousand others whereof all the ancient\r\nhistories are full.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Ah, my lord Magnifico, but God knows how those things happened; for\r\nthat age is so remote from us that many lies can be told and there is\r\nnone to refute them.”\r\n\r\n34.—The Magnifico said:\r\n\r\n“If in every age you will compare women’s worth with that of men, you\r\nwill find that they have never been and are not now at all inferior to\r\nmen in worth; for leaving aside the times that are so ancient, if you\r\ncome to the time when the Goths ruled in Italy, you will find that there\r\nwas a queen among them, Amalasontha,[381] who long reigned with\r\nadmirable wisdom; then Theodolinda,[382] queen of the Lombards, of\r\nsingular worth; Theodora,[383] the Greek empress; and in Italy among\r\nmany others the Countess Matilda was a most illustrious lady, of whose\r\npraises I will leave Count Ludovico to speak, since she was of his\r\nfamily.”[384]\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said the Count, “that rests with you, for you know it does not\r\nbecome a man to praise what is his own.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico continued:\r\n\r\n“And how many women in times past do you find belonging to this most\r\nnoble house of Montefeltro![385] How many of the house of Gonzaga, of\r\nEste, of Pio![386] Then, if we wish to speak of the present times, we\r\nshall have no need to seek very far for instances, because we have them\r\nat home. But I shall not avail myself of those we see before us, lest\r\nyou pretend to grant me out of courtesy that which you can in no wise\r\ndeny. And to go outside of Italy, remember that we in our day have seen\r\nQueen Anne of France,[387] a very great lady not less in worth than in\r\nstate; and if you will compare her in justice and clemency, liberality\r\nand pureness of life, with Kings Charles[388] and Louis[250] (to both of\r\nwhom she was consort), you will not find her at all their inferior. You\r\nsee madonna Margarita[389] (daughter of the Emperor Maximilian)[390] who\r\nhas until now governed and still governs her state with the utmost\r\nwisdom and justice.\r\n\r\n35.—“But laying all others aside, tell me, my lord Gaspar, what king or\r\nwhat prince has there been in our days, or even for many years past in\r\nChristendom, who deserves to be compared with Queen Isabella of\r\nSpain?”[391]\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“King Ferdinand, her husband.”[392]\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico continued:\r\n\r\n“That I shall not deny; for since the queen judged him worthy to be her\r\nhusband, and so loved and honoured him, we cannot say that he did not\r\ndeserve to be compared with her: yet I believe that the fame he had by\r\nher was a dowry not inferior to the kingdom of Castile.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ISABELLA THE CATHOLIC\r\n  1451-1504\r\n]\r\n\r\nMuch enlarged from a part of Laurent’s photograph (no. 533) of an\r\n    altar-piece, formerly in the royal chapel of the Convent of St.\r\n    Thomas de Avila, but now in the Prado Gallery at Madrid. It was\r\n    painted about 1491 by order of the Inquisitor Torquemada, and has\r\n    been attributed to Miguel Zittoz.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied my lord Gaspar, “I think that Queen Isabella had credit\r\nfor many of King Ferdinand’s deeds.”\r\n\r\nThen the Magnifico said:\r\n\r\n“Unless the people of Spain,—lords, commons, men and women, poor and\r\nrich,—have all agreed to lie in praise of her, there has not been in our\r\ntime on earth a brighter example of true goodness, of lofty spirit, of\r\nwisdom, of piety, of purity, of courtesy, of liberality,—in short, of\r\nevery virtue,—than Queen Isabella; and although the fame of that\r\nillustrious lady is very great in every place and among every nation,\r\nthose who lived in her company and were witness to her actions, do all\r\naffirm that this fame sprang from her virtue and merits. And whoever\r\nwill consider her deeds will easily perceive such to be the truth. For\r\nleaving aside countless things that give proof of this and could be told\r\nif it were our theme, everyone knows that when she came to reign she\r\nfound the greater part of Castile usurped by the grandees; yet she\r\nrecovered the whole so righteously and in such fashion that the very men\r\nwho were deprived of it, remained very devoted to her and content to\r\ngive up that which they possessed.\r\n\r\n“A very noted thing also is with what courage and wisdom she always\r\ndefended her realms against very powerful enemies; and likewise to her\r\nalone can be given the honour of the glorious conquest of the kingdom of\r\nGranada; for in this long and difficult war against obstinate\r\nenemies,—who were fighting for property, for life, for religion, and (to\r\ntheir thinking) for God,—she always showed, both in her counsel and in\r\nher very person, such virtue that perhaps few princes in our time have\r\nhad the hardihood, I will not say to imitate, but even to envy her.\r\n\r\n“Besides this, all who knew her affirm that she had such a divine manner\r\nof ruling that her mere wish seemed enough to make every man do quietly\r\nthat which he ought to do; so that men hardly dared in their own houses\r\nand secretly to do anything they thought would displease her: and in\r\ngreat part the cause of this was the admirable judgment she had in\r\ndiscerning and choosing right agents for the duties she meant to employ\r\nthem in; and so well did she know how to unite the rigour of justice\r\nwith the gentleness of mercy and liberality, that in her day there was\r\nno good man who complained of being ill rewarded, nor any bad man of\r\nbeing too severely punished. Thus there sprang up among the people an\r\nexceeding great reverence for her, composed of love and fear, which\r\nstill remains so implanted in the minds of all, that they almost seem to\r\nthink that she looks down upon them from heaven and must bestow praise\r\nor blame upon them from above; and thus those realms are still governed\r\nby her name and the methods she ordained, so that although her life is\r\nat an end, her authority lives,—like a wheel which, long revolved with\r\nforce, still turns of itself for a good space, although nothing more\r\nimpels it.\r\n\r\n“Consider also, my lord Gaspar, that in our times nearly all the men in\r\nSpain who are great or famous for anything whatever, were made so by\r\nQueen Isabella; and Consalvo Ferdinando, the Great Captain, was far\r\nprouder of this than of all his famous victories, and of those eminent\r\nand worthy deeds which have made him so bright and illustrious in peace\r\nand war, that if fame is not very thankless, she will always herald his\r\nimmortal praises to the world, and give proof that we have in our age\r\nhad few kings or great princes who have not been surpassed by him in\r\nmagnanimity, wisdom, and in every virtue.\r\n\r\n36.—“Returning now to Italy, I say that here too there is no lack of\r\nvery admirable ladies; for in Naples we have two remarkable queens;[393]\r\nand a short time since there died at Naples also the other queen of\r\nHungary,[394] you know how admirable a lady, and worthy to be the peer\r\nof the unconquerable and glorious king, Matthias Corvinus, her\r\nhusband.[395] Likewise the Duchess Isabella of Aragon, worthy sister to\r\nKing Ferdinand of Naples; who (like gold in the fire) showed her virtue\r\nand worth amid the storms of fortune.[396]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ISABELLA D’ESTE\r\n  MARCHIONESS OF MANTUA\r\n  1474-1539\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from a part of Braun’s photograph (no. 34.093) of the portrait\r\n    by Titian (1477-1576) in the Imperial Museum at Vienna. The picture\r\n    was painted about 1536 from a portrait painted about 1511 by\r\n    Francesco Raibolini, better known as Francia, (1450-1517). See\r\n    Alessandro Luzio’s article in the _Emporium_ (Bergamo), nos. 65-6.\r\n\r\n“If you come to Lombardy, you will find my lady Isabella, Marchioness of\r\nMantua;[397] to whose very admirable virtues injustice would be done in\r\nspeaking as soberly as in this place anyone must needs do who would\r\nspeak of her at all. I regret, too, that you did not all know her sister\r\nthe Duchess Beatrice of Milan, in order that you might never more have\r\nneed to marvel at woman’s capacity.[398] And Eleanora of Aragon, Duchess\r\nof Ferrara and mother of both these two ladies whom I have mentioned,\r\nwas of such sort that her very admirable virtues bore good witness to\r\nall the world that she not only was a worthy daughter of a king, but\r\ndeserved to be queen over a much greater realm than all her ancestors\r\nhad possessed.[399] And to tell you of another, how many men do you know\r\nin the world who have borne the cruel blows of fortune as patiently as\r\nQueen Isabella of Naples has done?[400]—who, after the loss of her\r\nkingdom, the exile and death of her husband King Federico[401] and of\r\ntwo children, and the captivity of her first-born, the Duke of\r\nCalabria,[402] still shows herself to be a queen, and so endures the\r\ngrievous burdens of bitter poverty as to give all men proof that\r\nalthough her fortunes are changed, her rank is not.\r\n\r\n“I refrain from mentioning countless other ladies, and also women of low\r\ndegree; like many Pisan women, who in defence of their city against the\r\nFlorentines displayed that generous daring, without any fear of death,\r\nwhich might have been displayed by the most unconquerable souls that\r\nhave ever been on earth; wherefore some of them have been celebrated by\r\nmany noble poets.[403]\r\n\r\n“I could tell you of some who were very excellent in letters, in music,\r\nin painting, in sculpture; but I do not wish to go on selecting from\r\namong these instances that are perfectly well known to you all. It is\r\nenough that if you reflect upon the women whom you yourselves know, it\r\nis not difficult for you to perceive that they are for the most part not\r\ninferior in worth and merits to their fathers, brothers and husbands;\r\nand that not a few have been the source of good to men and often have\r\ncorrected many a one of his errours; and if there are not now to be\r\nfound on earth those great queens who march to the conquest of distant\r\nlands, and erect great buildings, pyramids and cities,—like that famous\r\nTomyris, Queen of Scythia, Artemisia, Zenobia, Semiramis or\r\nCleopatra,[404]—neither are there men like Cæsar, Alexander, Scipio,\r\nLucullus and those other Roman commanders.”\r\n\r\n37.—“Say not so,” replied Frisio, laughing; “for now more than ever are\r\nthere women to be found like Cleopatra or Semiramis; and if they have\r\nnot such great states, power and riches, yet they lack not the good will\r\nto imitate those queens in giving themselves pleasure, and in satisfying\r\nas far as they can all their appetites.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano said:\r\n\r\n“You always wish to go beyond bounds, Frisio; but if there are some\r\nCleopatras to be found, there is no lack of countless Sardanapaluses,\r\nwhich is far worse.”[405]\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Do not draw these comparisons, or imagine that men are more incontinent\r\nthan women; and even if they were so, it would not be worse, for from\r\nwomen’s incontinence countless evils result that do not from men’s.\r\nTherefore, as was said yesterday, it is wisely ordained that women are\r\nallowed to fail in all other things without blame, to the end that they\r\nmay be able to devote all their strength to keeping themselves in this\r\none virtue of chastity; without which their children would be uncertain,\r\nand that tie would be dissolved which binds the whole world by blood and\r\nby the natural love of each man for what he has produced. Hence loose\r\nliving is more forbidden to women than to men, who do not carry their\r\nchildren for nine months within them.”\r\n\r\n38.—Then the Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Verily these are fine arguments which you cite, and I do not see why\r\nyou do not commit them to writing.\r\n\r\n“But tell me why it is not ordained that loose living is as disgraceful\r\na thing in men as in women, seeing that if men are by nature more\r\nvirtuous and of greater worth, they could all the more easily practise\r\nthis virtue of continence also; and their children would be neither more\r\nnor less certain, for although women were unchaste, they could of\r\nthemselves merely and without other aid in no wise bear children,\r\nprovided men were continent and did not take part in women’s unchastity.\r\nBut if you will say the truth, even you know that we men have of our own\r\nauthority arrogated to ourselves a licence, whereby we insist that the\r\nsame sins are in us very trivial and sometimes praiseworthy, and in\r\nwomen cannot be sufficiently punished, unless by shameful death or\r\nperpetual infamy at least.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, since this opinion is prevalent, methinks it were a fitting\r\nthing to punish severely those also who with lies cast infamy on women;\r\nand I think that every noble cavalier is bound always to defend the\r\ntruth with arms where there is need, and especially when he knows some\r\nwoman to be falsely accused of little chastity.”\r\n\r\n39.—“And I,” replied my lord Gaspar, laughing, “not only affirm that\r\nwhich you say is the duty of every noble cavalier, but I think that it\r\nis an act of great courtesy and gentleness to conceal the fault a woman\r\nmay have committed through mischance or over-love; and thus you may see\r\nthat I am more on the side of women, where reason permits it, than you\r\nare.\r\n\r\n“I do not, indeed, deny that men have taken a little liberty; and this\r\nbecause they know that according to universal opinion loose living does\r\nnot bring them the infamy that it does to women; who by reason of the\r\nfrailty of their sex are much more inclined towards their appetites than\r\nmen are; and if they sometimes refrain from satisfying their desires,\r\nthey do so from shame and not because their will is not quite ready.\r\nTherefore men have put the fear of infamy upon them as a bridle to keep\r\nthem almost by force to this virtue, without which they were in truth\r\nlittle to be prized; for the world has no good from women except the\r\nbearing of children.\r\n\r\n“But this is not the case with men, who rule cities and armies, and do\r\nso many other things of importance. Since you will have it so, I do not\r\ncare to deny that women can do these things; it is enough that they do\r\nnot. And when men have seen fit to set a pattern of continence, they\r\nhave excelled women in this virtue as well as in the others also,\r\nalthough you do not admit it. And as to this I will not rehearse so many\r\nhistories and fables as you have done, but merely refer you to the\r\ncontinence of two very great young lords, and to their victory, which is\r\nwont to make even men of lowest rank insolent. One is that of Alexander\r\nthe Great towards the very beautiful women of Darius,—an enemy, and a\r\nvanquished one at that;[406] the other, of Scipio, who having at the age\r\nof twenty-four years taken a city in Spain by force, there was brought\r\nbefore him a very beautiful and noble young woman, captured along with\r\nmany others; and hearing that she was the bride of a gentleman of the\r\ncountry, Scipio not only abstained from any wanton act towards her, but\r\nrestored her unspotted to her husband, bestowing a rich gift upon her\r\nbesides.[407]\r\n\r\n“I could tell you of Xenocrates,[408] who was so continent that a very\r\nbeautiful woman having laid herself down unclothed beside him, and\r\nemploying all the caresses and using all the arts that she knew, whereof\r\nshe was an admirable mistress, she had not the power to make him show\r\nthe slightest sign of impudicity, although she tried one whole night\r\nlong; and of Pericles, who on merely hearing someone praise a boy’s\r\nbeauty with overwarmth, reproved him sharply;[409] and of many others\r\nwho have been very continent of their own choice, and not from shame or\r\nfear of punishment, which move most women who practise this virtue: who\r\nfor all that deserve to be highly praised, and he who falsely casts the\r\ninfamy of unchasteness upon them is worthy of the heaviest punishment,\r\nas you have said.”\r\n\r\n40.—Then messer Cesare, who had been silent a long while, said:\r\n\r\n“Think in what fashion my lord Gaspar is wont to speak in blame of\r\nwoman, if these are the things that he says in their praise. But if my\r\nlord Magnifico will let me say a few things in his stead by way of reply\r\nto such matters as my lord Gaspar has, to my thinking, said falsely\r\nagainst women, it were well for both of us; as he will rest awhile and\r\nthen be better able to go on to declare some other excellence of the\r\nCourt Lady, and I shall hold myself much favoured at having an\r\nopportunity to share with him this duty of a good cavalier—that is, to\r\ndefend the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I pray you do so,” replied my lord Magnifico; “for methinks I have\r\nalready fulfilled my duty to the extent of my powers, and this\r\ndiscussion is now outside my subject.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare continued:\r\n\r\n“I am far from wishing to speak of the good that women do in the world\r\nbesides the bearing of children, for it has been sufficiently shown how\r\nnecessary they are not only to our being, but to our well-being; but I\r\nsay, my lord Gaspar, that if they are as you say more inclined to their\r\nappetites than men, and if for all that they abstain therefrom more than\r\nmen, which you admit,—they are as much worthier of praise as their sex\r\nis less strong to resist their natural appetites. And if you say they do\r\nit from shame, methinks that in place of a single virtue you give them\r\ntwo; for if shame is stronger in them than appetite and they for that\r\nreason abstain from evil acts, I think that this shame (which in short\r\nis nothing else but fear of infamy) is a very rare virtue and one\r\npossessed by very few men. And if I could, without infinite disgrace to\r\nmen, tell how many of them are plunged in shamelessness (which is the\r\nvice opposed to this virtue), I should pollute these chaste ears that\r\nhear me. These offenders against God and nature are for the most part\r\nmen already old, who make a calling, some of the priesthood, some of\r\nphilosophy, some of sacred law; and govern public affairs with a\r\nCatonian severity of countenance that gives promise of all the integrity\r\nin the world; and always allege the feminine sex to be very incontinent;\r\nnor do they ever lament anything more than their loss of natural vigor,\r\nwhich renders them unable to satisfy the abominable desires that still\r\nlinger in their thoughts after being denied by nature to their bodies;\r\nand hence they often find ways wherein strength is not necessary.\r\n\r\n41.—“But I do not wish to say more; and it is enough for me that you\r\ngrant me that women abstain from unchaste living more than men; and\r\ncertain it is that they are restrained by no other bridle than that\r\nwhich they themselves put on. That this is true, the greater part of\r\nthose who are confined with too close care, or beaten by their husbands\r\nor fathers, are less chaste than those who have some liberty.\r\n\r\n“But a great bridle to women generally is their love of true virtue and\r\ntheir desire for honour, whereof many whom I have known in my time make\r\nmore account than of their very life; and if you will say the truth,\r\nevery one of us has seen very noble youths, discreet, wise, valiant and\r\nbeautiful, spend many years in love, without omitting aught of care, of\r\ngifts, of prayers, of tears, in short, of anything that can be imagined;\r\nand all in vain. And but that I might be told that my qualities have\r\nnever made me worthy of ever being loved, I should call myself as\r\nwitness, who have more than once been nigh to death because of a woman’s\r\nunchangeable and too stern chastity.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“Marvel not at that: for women who are always wooed refuse to please him\r\nwho wooes them; and they who are not wooed, woo others.”[410]\r\n\r\n42.—Messer Cesare said:\r\n\r\n“I have never known these men who are wooed by women; but very many who,\r\non finding that they have tried in vain and spent time foolishly, resort\r\nto this noble revenge, and say they have had an abundance of that which\r\nthey have only imagined, and think it a kind of courtiership to speak\r\nevil and invent tales to the end that slanderous stories of some noble\r\nlady may spring up among the rabble. But such as these, who make vile\r\nboast (whether true or false) of conquering a gentle lady, deserve\r\npunishment or torture most severe; and if they sometimes meet it, we\r\ncannot measure the praise due to those who perform the office. For if\r\nthey are telling lies, what villainy can be greater than to steal from a\r\nworthy lady that which she values more than life? And for no other\r\nreason than that which ought to win endless praise for her? Again, if\r\nthey are telling the truth, what punishment could suffice for a man who\r\nis so vile as to reward with such ingratitude a woman, who,—vanquished\r\nby false flatteries, by feigned tears, by continual wooing, by laments,\r\nby arts, tricks and perjuries,—has suffered herself to be led into too\r\ngreat love, and then without reserve has fondly given herself a prey to\r\nsuch a malign spirit?\r\n\r\n“But to answer you further touching that unheard-of continence of\r\nAlexander and Scipio which you have cited, I say I am unwilling to deny\r\nthat both performed an act worthy of much praise; yet to the end that\r\nyou may not be able to say that in rehearsing ancient matters I tell you\r\nfables, I wish to cite a woman of low degree in our own times, who\r\nshowed far more continence than these two great men.\r\n\r\n43.—“I say, then, that I once knew a beautiful and gentle girl, whose\r\nname I do not tell you lest you give food for slander to many fools, who\r\nconceive a bad opinion of a woman as soon as they hear of her being in\r\nlove. Well, this girl having been long loved by a noble and\r\nwell-conditioned youth, began to love him with all her mind and heart;\r\nand of this not only I (to whom she voluntarily confided everything as\r\nif I had been, I will not say her brother, but her dearest sister), but\r\nall those who saw her in the presence of the beloved youth, were very\r\ncertain of her passion. Loving thus as fervently as a very loving soul\r\ncan love, she maintained such continence for two years that she never\r\ngave this youth any token of loving him, except such as she could not\r\nhide; neither would she ever speak to him or receive letters from him or\r\ngifts, although a day never passed but she was besought to do both. And\r\nI well know how she longed for it, because if she was sometimes able to\r\npossess anything secretly that had been the youth’s, she held it so dear\r\nthat it seemed to be the source of her life and all her weal; and never\r\nin all that time would she grant him other pleasure than to see him and\r\nlet herself be seen, and to dance with him as with the others when she\r\ntook part in public festivals.\r\n\r\n“And since they were well suited to each other in condition, the girl\r\nand the youth desired that their great love might end happily, and that\r\nthey might be man and wife together. The same was desired by all the\r\nother men and women of their city, except her cruel father, who out of\r\nperverse and strange caprice wished to marry her to another and richer\r\nman; and to this the unhappy girl opposed naught but very bitter tears.\r\nAnd the ill-starred marriage having been concluded, with much pity from\r\nthe people and to the despair of the poor lovers, even this blow of\r\nfortune did not avail to destroy the love so deeply rooted in their\r\nhearts; which still endured for the space of three years, although she\r\nvery prudently concealed it and sought in every way to stifle those\r\ndesires that now were hopeless. And all this time she kept her stern\r\nresolve of continence; and as she could not honourably possess him whom\r\nalone in the world she adored, she chose not to wish for him in any\r\nwise, and to follow her custom of accepting neither messages nor gifts\r\nnor even glances from him; and in this fixed resolve, the poor girl,\r\novercome by sharpest anguish and grown very wasted from long passion,\r\ndied at the end of three years, preferring to renounce the joys and\r\npleasures so eagerly desired, and at last her very life, rather than her\r\nhonour. Nor was she without ways and means of satisfying herself quite\r\nsecretly and without risk of disgrace or any other harm; and yet she\r\nabstained from that which she herself so greatly desired and towards\r\nwhich she was so urged continually by the person whom alone in the world\r\nshe desired to please: nor was she moved therein by fear or any other\r\nmotive than mere love of true virtue.\r\n\r\n“What will you say of another, who for six months spent nearly every\r\nnight with a dearly cherished lover; yet, in a garden full of sweetest\r\nfruits, invited by her own most ardent longing and by the prayers and\r\ntears of one dearer to her than life itself, she refrained from tasting\r\nthem; and although she was caught and held in the fast bonds of those\r\nbeloved arms, she never yielded herself vanquished, but preserved the\r\nflower of her chastity immaculate.\r\n\r\n44.—“Do you think, my lord Gaspar, that these acts of continence are\r\nequal to Alexander’s?—who (being most ardently enamoured, not of\r\nDarius’s women, but of that fame and greatness which incited him by\r\nthirst for glory to endure toils and dangers to make himself immortal)\r\nspurned not only other things, but his own life, in order to win renown\r\nabove all other men. And do we marvel that with such thoughts at heart\r\nhe abstained from something he did not much desire? For since he had\r\nnever seen the women before, he could not possibly love them in a\r\nmoment, but perhaps even loathed them because of his enemy Darius; and\r\nin that case every wanton act of his towards them would have been\r\noutrage and not love. Hence it is no great thing that Alexander, who\r\nconquered the world no less by magnanimity than by arms, abstained from\r\ndoing outrage to women.\r\n\r\n“Scipio’s continence also is much to be praised. Yet if you consider\r\nrightly, it is not to be compared with these two women’s; for he too\r\nlikewise abstained from something not desired;—being in a hostile\r\ncountry, newly in command, at the beginning of a very important\r\nenterprise; having left great expectations of himself at home, and bound\r\nto render an account to very strict judges, who often punished very\r\nsmall mistakes as well as great, and among whom he knew he had enemies;\r\nconscious also that if he acted otherwise (the lady being very noble and\r\nmarried to a very noble lord), he might arouse so many enemies and in\r\nsuch fashion that they might long hinder and perhaps quite snatch away\r\nhis success. Hence, for reasons thus many and important, he abstained\r\nfrom a light and harmful wish, displaying continence and generous\r\nuprightness; which, as it is written, gave him the entire good will of\r\nthose nations, and was worth another army to him, wherewith by\r\ngentleness to conquer hearts that perhaps would have been unconquerable\r\nby force of arms.[411]\r\n\r\n                       .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, my lord Gaspar, if I say the truth, for in short these are\r\nthe miraculous continences that men write about themselves while\r\naccusing women of incontinence, in whom we every day see countless\r\ntokens of continence; for in truth, if you consider well, there is no\r\nfortress so impregnable and well defended that, if it were assailed with\r\na thousandth part of the wiles and tricks that are employed to overcome\r\nthe steadfast heart of woman, it would not surrender at the first\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n“How many creatures of great lords,—enriched by them and placed in very\r\nhigh esteem, entrusted with their castles and fortresses, whereon depend\r\ntheir whole state, life and weal,—have basely and sordidly surrendered\r\nthese to such as had no right thereto, without shame or fear of being\r\ncalled traitors? And would to God there were so great a dearth of such\r\nmen in our days, that we might have no more trouble to find a man who\r\nhad done his duty in this regard, than to name those who have failed in\r\ntheirs. Do we not see many others who daily go about slaying men in the\r\nforest and scouring the sea solely to steal money?\r\n\r\n“How many prelates sell the property of God’s church! How many lawyers\r\nforge wills! How many perjurers bear false witness only to get money!\r\nHow many physicians poison the sick to the same end! Again, how many do\r\nthe vilest things from fear of death! And yet a tender and delicate girl\r\noften resists all these sharp and hard encounters; for many have been\r\nfound who preferred death rather than lose their chastity.”\r\n\r\n47.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“These, messer Cesare, I believe are not on earth to-day.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare replied:\r\n\r\n“I will not cite the ancients now; but I tell you this, that many would\r\nbe and are to be found, who in such case do not fear to die. And now I\r\nremember that when Capua was sacked by the French (which was not so long\r\nago that you cannot recall it very well),[412] a beautiful young Capuan\r\nlady being led out of her house, where she had been captured by a\r\ncompany of Gascons, when she reached the river that flows through\r\nCapua,[413] she pretended that she wished to tie her shoe, so that he\r\nwho was leading her let her go a little, and she suddenly threw herself\r\ninto the river.\r\n\r\n“What will you say of a peasant girl, who not many months ago, at\r\nGazuolo in the Mantuan territory,[414] went with her sister to reap corn\r\nin the fields, and being overcome with thirst, entered a house for a\r\ndrink of water; and the master of the house, who was a young man, seeing\r\nthat she was very beautiful and alone, took her in his arms, and first\r\nwith soft words, and then with threats, sought to persuade her to his\r\nwishes; and she resisting more and more stubbornly, he at last overcame\r\nher with many blows and with force. So, dishevelled and weeping, she\r\nwent back to her sister in the field, nor would she for all her sister’s\r\nurgent questioning tell what outrage she had received in that house; but\r\non the way home, feigning to grow calmer little by little and to speak\r\nquite without agitation, she gave her sister some directions. Then when\r\nshe came to the Oglio, which is the river that flows by Gazuolo,[415]\r\nshe left her sister a little behind not knowing or imagining what she\r\nmeant to do, and suddenly threw herself in. Wailing and weeping her\r\nsister ran after her as fast as possible along the bank of the river,\r\nwhich was bearing her down-stream very rapidly: and each time the poor\r\ncreature rose to the surface, her sister threw her a cord which they had\r\nto bind the corn, and although the cord reached her hands several times\r\n(for she was still near the bank), the steadfast and determined girl\r\nalways refused it and put it from her; and thus rejecting every aid that\r\nmight save her life, she soon died: nor was she moved by nobility of\r\nbirth, nor by fear of most cruel death or of infamy, but solely by grief\r\nfor her lost virginity.[416]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LUDOVICO GONZAGA\r\n  BISHOP OF MANTUA\r\n  1458-1511\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph, specially made by Signor Lanzoni, of a part of the\r\n    fresco, “The Return of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga,” in the _Sala\r\n    degli Sposi_ of the Gonzaga Palace at Mantua, painted not later than\r\n    1474 by Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506). See Woltmann’s _Geschichte der\r\n    Malerei_, ii, 268.\r\n\r\n“Now from this you can understand how many other women, who are not\r\nknown, perform acts most worthy of praise; for although this one gave\r\nsuch proof of her virtue only three days since, as one may say, there is\r\nno talk of her and even her name is unknown. But if the death of our\r\nlady Duchess’s uncle, the Bishop of Mantua,[417] had not occurred at\r\nthat time, the bank of the Oglio, at the place where she threw herself\r\nin, would have been graced by a very beautiful monument to the memory of\r\nthat glorious soul, which deserved so much the brighter fame after\r\ndeath, because in life it dwelt in a less noble body.”\r\n\r\n48.—Here messer Cesare made a little pause; then he continued:\r\n\r\n“At Rome, in my day, there happened another like case; and it was that a\r\nbeautiful and noble Roman girl, being long pursued by one who seemed to\r\nlove her much, was never willing to favour him at all, even with a\r\nsingle look. So, by means of money he corrupted one of her women; who,\r\ndesirous of satisfying him in order to get more money from him,\r\npersuaded her mistress to visit the church of San Sebastiano on a\r\ncertain day of small solemnity;[418] and having made everything known to\r\nthe lover and shown him what he must do, she led the girl to one of\r\nthose dark caves which nearly all who go to San Sebastiano are wont to\r\nvisit; and in this the young man was already hidden secretly.\r\n\r\n“Finding himself alone with her whom he loved so much, he began in all\r\nways to beg her as gently as he could to have pity on him and change her\r\nformer hardness to love. But after he saw all his prayers to be in vain,\r\nhe had resort to threats, which failing too, he began to beat her\r\ncruelly; at last, although firmly resolved to attain his end, by force\r\nif necessary, and therein employing the help of the infamous woman who\r\nhad led her thither, he was never able to bring her to consent. Nay,\r\nwith both word and deed (although she had little strength), the poor\r\ngirl defended herself to the last: so that partly from anger at seeing\r\nthat he could not obtain what he desired, partly from fear lest her\r\nrelatives might make him suffer for it when they learned the thing, this\r\nwretch, with the help of the servant (who feared the like), strangled\r\nthe unhappy girl and left her there; and having fled, he took means not\r\nto be discovered. Blinded by her very crime, the servant could not flee,\r\nand being taken into custody on suspicion, confessed everything and so\r\nwas punished as she deserved.\r\n\r\n“The body of the steadfast and noble girl was taken from that cave with\r\nthe greatest honour and brought to Rome for burial, with a laurel crown\r\nupon her head, and accompanied by a countless host of men and women;\r\namong whom there was no one who went home without tears in his eyes; and\r\nthus was this rare soul universally mourned as well as praised by all\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n49.—“But to speak to you of those whom you yourselves know, do you not\r\nremember having heard that when my lady Felice della Rovere was\r\njourneying to Savona,[419] and feared that some sails that were sighted\r\nwere vessels of Pope Alexander in pursuit of her, she made ready with\r\nfixed resolve to cast herself into the sea, in case they should come up\r\nand there was no remedy by flight: and it is in no wise to be believed\r\nthat she acted in this from lightness, for you know as well as any other\r\nwith what intelligence and wisdom this lady’s singular beauty was\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\n“Nor can I refrain from saying a word of our lady Duchess, who having\r\nfor fifteen years lived like a widow in company with her husband, not\r\nonly was steadfast in never revealing this to anyone in the world, but\r\nwhen urged by her own people to lay aside her widowhood, she chose\r\nrather to endure exile, poverty and every other sort of hardship, than\r\nto accept that which seemed to all others great favour and blessing of\r\nfortune;”[420] and as messer Cesare was going on to speak of this, my\r\nlady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“Speak of something else, and go no further with this subject, for you\r\nhave many other things to say.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare continued:\r\n\r\n“Yet I know you will not deny this, my lord Gaspar, nor you, Frisio.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed no,” replied Frisio; “but one does not make a host.”\r\n\r\n50.—Then messer Cesare said:\r\n\r\n“It is true that such great results as these are met in few women:\r\nstill, those also who withstand the assaults of love are all admirable;\r\nand those who are sometimes overcome deserve much pity: for certainly\r\nthe urgence of lovers, the arts they use, the snares they spread, are so\r\nmany and so continual that it is but too great a wonder that a tender\r\ngirl can escape. What day, what hour, ever passes that the persecuted\r\ngirl is not besought by the lover with money, gifts and all things that\r\nmust please her? When can she ever go to her window, but she shall\r\nalways see her persistent lover pass, silent in word but with eyes that\r\nspeak, with sad and languid face, with those burning sighs, often with\r\nmost abundant tears? When does she ever go forth to church or other\r\nplace, but he is always before her, and meets her at every turn of the\r\nstreet with his melancholy passion depicted in his eyes, as if he were\r\nexpecting instant death? I leave aside the fripperies, inventions,\r\nmottoes, devices, festivals, dances, games, masques, jousts,\r\ntourneys!—all which things she knows are made for her.\r\n\r\n“Then at night she can never wake but she hears music, or at least his\r\nunquiet spirit sighing about the house walls and making lamentable\r\nsounds. If by chance she wishes to speak to one of her women, the wench\r\n(already corrupted with money) soon has ready a little gift, a letter, a\r\nsonnet or some such thing to give her on the lover’s behalf, and then\r\ncoming in opportunely, makes her understand how the poor man is burning\r\nwith love, and in her service cares naught for his own life; and how he\r\nseeks nothing from her that is less than seemly, and only desires to\r\nspeak with her. Then remedies are found for all difficulties, false\r\nkeys, rope ladders, sleeping potions; the thing is painted as of little\r\nconsequence; instances are given of many other women who do far worse.\r\nThus everything is made so easy that she has no further trouble than to\r\nsay, ‘I am willing.’ And even if the poor girl holds back for a time,\r\nthey add so many inducements, find so many ways, that with their\r\ncontinual battering they break down that which stays her.\r\n\r\n“And when they see that blandishments do not avail them, there are many\r\nwho have resort to threats and say they will accuse the woman to her\r\nhusband of being what she is not. Others bargain boldly with the fathers\r\nand often with the husbands, who for money or to get favours give their\r\nown daughters and wives as an unwilling prey. Others seek by\r\nincantations and sorceries to steal from them that liberty which God has\r\nbestowed upon their souls: whereof startling results are seen.\r\n\r\n“But I could not in a thousand years rehearse all the wiles that men\r\nemploy to bring women to their wishes, for the wiles are infinite; and\r\nbesides those that every man finds for himself, writers have not been\r\nlacking who have ingeniously composed books and therein taken every\r\npains to teach how women are to be duped in these matters.[421] Now,\r\namong so many snares, think how there can be any safety for these simple\r\ndoves, lured by such sweet bait. And what wonder is it, then, if a woman\r\n(seeing herself thus loved and adored for many years by a beautiful,\r\nnoble and accomplished youth, who a thousand times a day puts himself in\r\ndanger of death to serve her, nor ever thinks of aught but to please\r\nher) is finally brought to love him by continual wearing (as water wears\r\nthe hardest marble), and, conquered by this passion, contents him with\r\nthat which you say she in the weakness of her sex desires more than her\r\nlover? Do you think that this errour is so grave that the poor creature\r\nwho has been caught by so many flatteries, does not deserve even that\r\npardon which is often vouchsafed to homicides, thieves, assassins and\r\ntraitors? Will you insist that this offence is so heinous that because\r\nyou find some woman commits it, womankind ought to be wholly despised\r\nand held universally devoid of continence, without regard to the many\r\nwho are found unconquerable, and who are proof against love’s continual\r\nincitements, and firmer in their infinite constancy than rocks against\r\nthe surges of the ocean?”\r\n\r\n51.—Messer Cesare having ceased speaking, my lord Gaspar then began to\r\nreply, but my lord Ottaviano said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“For the love of Heaven, pray grant him the victory, for I know you will\r\nprofit little; and methinks I see that you will make not only all these\r\nladies your enemies, but the greater part of the men also.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“Nay, the ladies have great cause to thank me; for if I had not gainsaid\r\nmy lord Magnifico and messer Cesare, all these praises which they have\r\nbestowed upon women would not have been heard.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FERDINAND THE CATHOLIC\r\n  1452-1516\r\n]\r\n\r\nMuch enlarged from a part of Laurent’s photograph (no. 533) of an\r\n    altar-piece, formerly in the royal chapel of the Convent of St.\r\n    Thomas de Avila, but now in the Prado Gallery at Madrid. It was\r\n    painted about 1491 by order of the Inquisitor Torquemada, and has\r\n    been attributed to Miguel Zittoz.\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare said:\r\n\r\n“The things that my lord Magnifico and I have said in praise of women,\r\nand many others too, were very well known and hence superfluous.\r\n\r\n“Who does not know that without women we can feel no content or\r\nsatisfaction throughout this life of ours, which but for them would be\r\nrude and devoid of all sweetness and more savage than that of wild\r\nbeasts? Who does not know that women alone banish from our hearts all\r\nvile and base thoughts, vexations, miseries, and those turbid\r\nmelancholies that so often are their fellows? and if you will consider\r\nwell the truth, we shall also see that in our understanding of great\r\nmatters women do not hamper our wits but rather quicken them, and in war\r\nmake men fearless and brave beyond measure. And certainly it is\r\nimpossible for vileness ever again to rule in a man’s heart where once\r\nthe flame of love has entered; for whoever loves desires always to make\r\nhimself as lovable as he can, and always fears lest some disgrace befall\r\nhim that may make him to be esteemed lightly with her by whom he desires\r\nto be esteemed highly. Nor does he stop at risking his life a thousand\r\ntimes a day to show himself worthy of her love: hence whoever could form\r\nan army of lovers and have them fight in the presence of the ladies of\r\ntheir love, would conquer all the world, unless there were opposed to it\r\nanother army similarly in love. And be well assured that Troy’s ten\r\nyears’ resistance against all Greece proceeded from naught else but a\r\nfew lovers, who on sallying forth to battle, armed themselves in the\r\npresence of their women; and often these women helped them and spoke\r\nsome word to them at leaving, which inflamed them and made them more\r\nthan men. Then in battle they knew that they were watched by their women\r\nfrom the walls and towers; wherefore it seemed to them that every act of\r\nhardihood they performed, every proof they gave, won them their women’s\r\npraise, which was the greatest reward they could have in the world.\r\n\r\n“There are many who think that the victory of King Ferdinand of Spain\r\nand Queen Isabella against the King of Granada was in great part due to\r\nwomen; for very often when the Spanish army went out to meet the enemy,\r\nQueen Isabella went out also with all her maids of honour, and in the\r\narmy went many noble cavaliers who were in love. These always went\r\nconversing with their ladies until they reached the place where the\r\nenemy were seen, then taking leave each of his own lady, they went on in\r\nthis presence to meet the enemy with that fierce spirit which was\r\naroused in them by their love and by the desire to make their ladies\r\nsensible of being served by men of valour; thus a very few Spanish\r\ncavaliers were often found putting a host of Moors to flight and to\r\ndeath, thanks to gentle and beloved women.\r\n\r\n“So I do not see, my lord Gaspar, what perversity of judgment has led\r\nyou to cast reproach on women.\r\n\r\n52.—“Do you not know that the origin of all the graceful exercises that\r\ngive pleasure in the world is to be ascribed to none other than to\r\nwomen? Who learns to dance and caper gallantly for aught else than to\r\nplease women? Who studies the sweetness of music for other cause than\r\nthis? Who tries to compose verses, in the vernacular at least, unless to\r\nexpress those feelings that are inspired by women? Think how many very\r\nnoble poems we should be deprived of, both in the Greek tongue and in\r\nthe Latin, if women had been lightly esteemed by the poets. But to pass\r\nall the others by, would it not have been a very great loss if messer\r\nFrancesco Petrarch, who so divinely wrote his loves in this language of\r\nours, had turned his mind solely to things Latin, as he would have done\r\nif the love of madonna Laura had not sometimes drawn him from them?[422]\r\nI do not name you the bright geniuses now on earth and present here, who\r\nevery day put forth some noble fruit and yet choose their subject only\r\nfrom the beauties and virtues of women.\r\n\r\n“You see that Solomon, wishing to write mystically of things lofty and\r\ndivine, to cover them with a graceful veil composed a fervent and tender\r\ndialogue between a lover and his sweetheart, deeming that he could not\r\nhere below find any similitude more apt and befitting things divine than\r\nlove for women; and in this way he tried to give us a little of the\r\nsavour of that divinity which he both by knowledge and by grace knew\r\nbetter than the rest.[423]\r\n\r\n“Hence there was no need, my lord Gaspar, to dispute about this, or at\r\nleast so wordily: but by gainsaying the truth you have prevented us from\r\nhearing a thousand other fine and weighty matters concerning the\r\nperfection of the Court Lady.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“I believe nothing more is left to say; yet if you think that my lord\r\nMagnifico has not adorned her with enough good qualities, the fault lay\r\nnot with him, but with the one who arranged that there are not more\r\nvirtues in the world; for the Magnifico gave her all there are.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“You shall now see that my lord Magnifico will find still others.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my Lady, methinks I have said enough, and for my part I am\r\ncontent with this Lady of mine; and if these gentlemen will not have her\r\nas she is, let them leave her to me.”\r\n\r\n53.—Here everyone remaining silent, messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Magnifico, to spur you on to say something more, I should like\r\nto put you a question concerning what you would have the chief business\r\nof the Court Lady, and it is this: that I wish to hear how she ought to\r\nconduct herself with respect to one detail which seems to me very\r\nimportant; for although the excellent qualities wherewith you have\r\nendowed her include genius, wisdom, good sense, ease of bearing,\r\nmodesty, and so many other virtues, whereby she ought in reason to be\r\nable to converse with everyone and on every theme, still I think that\r\nmore than anything else she needs to know that which belongs to\r\ndiscussions on love. For as every gentle cavalier uses those noble\r\nexercises, elegances and fine manners that we have mentioned, as a means\r\nto win the favour of women, to this end likewise he employs words; and\r\nnot only when he is moved by passion, but often also to do honour to the\r\nlady with whom he is speaking, since he thinks that to give signs of\r\nlove for her is a proof that she is worthy of it, and that her beauty\r\nand merits are so great that they compel every man to serve her.\r\n\r\n“Hence I fain would know how this lady ought to converse on such a theme\r\ndiscreetly, and how reply to him who loves her truly, and how to him who\r\nmakes a false pretence thereof; and whether she ought to feign not to\r\nunderstand, whether to return his love or to refuse, and how conduct\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n54.—Then my lord Magnifico said:\r\n\r\n“It would be needful to teach her first to distinguish those who pretend\r\nto love and those who love truly; then, as to returning love or not, I\r\nthink she ought not to be governed by any others’ wish but her own.”\r\n\r\nMesser Federico said:\r\n\r\n“Then teach her what are the surest and safest signs to discern false\r\nlove from true, and with what proof she ought to be content in order to\r\nbe sure of the love shown her.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“I know not, for men to-day are so cunning that they make false\r\npretences without end, and sometimes weep when they have great wish to\r\nlaugh; hence it were necessary to send them to Isola Ferma under the\r\nTrue Lovers’ Arch.[424]\r\n\r\n“But to the end that this Lady of mine (of whom it behooves me to take\r\nspecial care, since she is my creation) may not fall into those errours\r\nwherein I have seen many others fall, I should tell her not to be quick\r\nto believe herself loved, nor act like some who not only do not feign\r\nnot to understand when court is paid to them even covertly, but at the\r\nfirst word accept all the praise that is given them, or decline it with\r\na certain air that is rather an invitation to love for those with whom\r\nthey are speaking, than a refusal.\r\n\r\n“Therefore the course of conduct that I wish my Court Lady to pursue in\r\nlove talk, will be to refuse always to believe that whoever pays court\r\nto her for that reason loves her: and if the gentleman shall be as pert\r\nas many are, and speak to her with small respect, she will give him such\r\nanswer that he may clearly understand he is causing her annoyance.\r\nAgain, if he shall be discreet and use modest phrases and words of love\r\ncovertly, with that gentle manner which I think the Courtier fashioned\r\nby these gentlemen will employ, the lady will feign not to understand\r\nand will apply his words in another sense, always modestly trying to\r\nchange the subject with that skill and prudence which have been said\r\nbefit her. If, again, the talk is such that she cannot feign not to\r\nunderstand, she will take it all as a jest, pretending to be aware that\r\nit is said to her more out of compliment to her than because it is so,\r\ndepreciating her merits and ascribing the praises that he gives her to\r\nthe gentleman’s courtesy; and in this way she will win a name for\r\ndiscretion and be safer against deceit.\r\n\r\n“After this fashion methinks the Court Lady ought to conduct herself in\r\nlove talk.”\r\n\r\n55.—Then messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Magnifico, you discourse of this matter as if everyone who pays\r\ncourt to women must needs speak lies and seek to deceive them: if the\r\nwhich were true, I should say that your teachings were sound; but if\r\nthis cavalier who is speaking loves truly and feels that passion which\r\nsometimes so sorely afflicts the human heart, do you not consider in\r\nwhat pain, in what calamity and mortal anguish you put him by insisting\r\nthat the lady shall never believe anything he says on this subject?\r\nOught his supplications, tears, and many other signs to go for naught?\r\nHave a care, my lord Magnifico, lest it be thought that besides the\r\nnatural cruelty which many of these ladies have in them, you are\r\nteaching them still more.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“I spoke not of him who loves, but of him who entertains with amourous\r\ntalk, wherein one of the most necessary conditions is that words shall\r\nnever be lacking. But just as true lovers have glowing hearts, so they\r\nhave cold tongues, with broken speech and sudden silence; wherefore\r\nperhaps it would not be a false assumption to say: ‘Who loves much,\r\nspeaks little.’ Yet as to this I believe no certain rule can be given,\r\nbecause of the diversity of men’s habits; nor could I say anything more\r\nthan that the Lady must be very cautious, and always bear in mind that\r\nmen can declare their love with much less danger than women can.”\r\n\r\n56.—Then my lord Gaspar said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Would you not, my lord Magnifico, have this admirable Lady of yours\r\nlove in return even when she knows that she is loved truly? For if the\r\nCourtier were not loved in return, it is not conceivable that he should\r\ngo on loving her; and thus she would lose many advantages, and\r\nespecially that service and reverence with which lovers honour and\r\nalmost adore the virtue of their beloved.”\r\n\r\n“As to that,” replied the Magnifico, “I do not wish to give advice; but\r\nI do say that I think love, as you understand it, is proper only for\r\nunmarried women; for when this love cannot end in marriage, the lady\r\nmust always find in it that remorse and sting which things illicit give\r\nher, and run risk of staining that reputation for chastity which is so\r\nimportant to her.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“This opinion of yours, my lord Magnifico, seems to me very austere, and\r\nI think you have learned it from some preacher—one of those who rebuke\r\nwomen for loving laymen, in order to have themselves the better part\r\ntherein. And methinks you impose too hard a rule on married women, for\r\nmany of them are to be found whose husbands bear them the greatest\r\nhatred without cause, and affront them grievously, sometimes by loving\r\nother women, sometimes by causing them all the annoyances possible to\r\ndevise; some against their will are married by their fathers to old men,\r\ninfirm, loathsome and disgusting, who make them live in continual\r\nmisery. If such women were allowed to be divorced and separated from\r\nthose with whom they are ill mated, perhaps it would not be fitting for\r\nthem to love any but their husbands; but when, either by enmity of the\r\nstars or by unfitness of temperament or by other accident, it happens\r\nthat the marriage bed, which ought to be a nest of concord and of love,\r\nis strewn by the accursed infernal fury with the seed of its venom,\r\nwhich then brings forth anger, suspicion and the stinging thorns of\r\nhatred to torment those unhappy souls cruelly bound by an unbreakable\r\nchain until death,—why are you unwilling that the woman should be\r\nallowed to seek some refuge from the heavy lash, and to bestow on others\r\nthat which is not only spurned but hated by her husband? I am quite of\r\nthe opinion that those who have suitable husbands and are loved by them,\r\nought not to do them wrong; but the others wrong themselves by not\r\nloving those who love them.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied the Magnifico, “they wrong themselves by loving others\r\nthan their husbands. Still, since not to love is often beyond our power,\r\nif this mischance shall happen to the Court Lady (that her husband’s\r\nhate or another’s love brings her to love), I would have her yield her\r\nlover nothing but her spirit; nor ever let her show him any clear sign\r\nof love (either by words or by gestures or by any other means) by which\r\nhe may be sure of it.”\r\n\r\n57.—Then messer Roberto da Bari said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“I appeal from this judgment of yours, my lord Magnifico, and think I\r\nshall have many with me; but since you will teach married women this\r\nrusticity, so to speak, do you wish also to have the unmarried equally\r\ncruel and discourteous?—and complaisant to their lovers in nothing\r\nwhatever?”\r\n\r\n“If my Court Lady be unmarried,” replied my lord Magnifico, “and must\r\nlove, I wish her to love someone whom she can marry; nor shall I account\r\nit an errour if she shows him some sign of love: as to which matter I\r\nwish to teach her one universal rule in a few words, to the end that she\r\nmay with little pains be able to bear it in mind; and this is, let her\r\nshow him who loves her every token of love except such as may imbue her\r\nlover’s mind with the hope of obtaining something wanton from her. And\r\nit is necessary to give great heed to this, for it is an errour\r\ncommitted by countless women, who commonly desire nothing more than to\r\nbe beautiful: and since to have many lovers seems to them proof of their\r\nbeauty, they take every pain] to get as many as they can. Thus they are\r\noften carried into reckless behaviour, and forsaking that temperate\r\nmodesty which so becomes them, they employ certain pert looks with\r\nscurrile words and acts full of immodesty, thinking that they are gladly\r\nseen and listened to for this and that by such ways they make themselves\r\nloved: which is false; for the demonstrations that are made to them\r\nspring from desire excited by a belief in their willingness, not from\r\nlove. Wherefore I wish that my Court Lady may not by wanton behaviour\r\nseem to offer herself to anyone who wants her and to do her best to lure\r\nthe eyes and appetite of all who look upon her, but that by her merits\r\nand virtuous conduct, by her loveliness, by her grace, she may imbue the\r\nmind of all who see her with that true love which is due to all things\r\nlovable, and with that respect which always deprives him of hope who\r\nthinks of any wantonness.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, he who is loved by such a woman ought to content himself with\r\nher every slightest demonstration, and to prize a single loving look\r\nfrom her more than complete possession of any other woman; and to such a\r\nLady I should not know how to add anything, unless to have her loved by\r\nso excellent a Courtier as these gentlemen have described, and to have\r\nher love him also, to the end that they may both attain their complete\r\nperfection.”\r\n\r\n58.—Having thus far spoken, my lord Magnifico was silent; whereupon my\r\nlord Gaspar said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Now, in sooth, you will not be able to complain that my lord Magnifico\r\nhas not described a most excellent Court Lady; and henceforth, if such\r\nan one is found, I admit that she deserves to be esteemed the Courtier’s\r\nequal.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia replied:\r\n\r\n“I engage to find her, provided you will find the Courtier.”\r\n\r\nMesser Roberto added:\r\n\r\n“Verily it cannot be denied that the Lady described by my lord Magnifico\r\nis most perfect: nevertheless, as to those last conditions of love,\r\nmethinks he has made her a little too austere, especially when he would\r\nhave her deprive her lover of all hope, by words, gestures and\r\nbehaviour, and do all she can to plunge the man in despair. For as\r\neveryone knows, human desires do not spend themselves upon those things\r\nwhereof there is not some hope. And although a few women may have indeed\r\nbeen found, haughty perhaps by reason of their beauty and worth, whose\r\nfirst word to anyone who paid them court was that he must never expect\r\nto have anything from them that he wished,—yet afterwards they have been\r\na little more gracious to him in look and manner, so that by their\r\nkindly acts they have somewhat tempered their haughty words. But if this\r\nLady by acts and words and manner removes all hope, I think our\r\nCourtier, if he is wise, will never love her; and thus she will have the\r\nimperfection of being without a lover.”\r\n\r\n59.—Then the Magnifico said:\r\n\r\n“I do not wish my Court Lady to remove hope of everything, but only of\r\nwanton things, which (if the Courtier be as courteous and discreet as\r\nthese gentlemen have described him) he will not only not hope for, but\r\nwill not even wish for. Because if the beauty, behaviour, cleverness,\r\ngoodness, knowledge, modesty, and the many other worthy qualities that\r\nwe have given the Lady, are the cause of the Courtier’s love for her,\r\nthe end of his love will necessarily be worthy too: and if nobility,\r\nexcellence in arms and letters and music, if gentleness and the\r\npossession of so many graces in speech and conversation, be the means\r\nwhereby the Courtier is to win the lady’s love, the end of that love\r\nmust needs be of like quality with the means whereby it is attained.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, just as there are divers sorts of beauty in the world, so too\r\nthere are divers tastes in men; and thus it happens that when they see a\r\nwoman of that serious beauty, which (whether she be going or staying or\r\njoking or jesting or doing what you will) always so tempers her whole\r\nbehaviour as to induce a certain reverence in anyone who looks upon\r\nher,—many are abashed and dare not serve her; and lured by hope, they\r\noftener love attractive and enticing women, so soft and tender as to\r\ndisplay in words and acts and looks a certain languourous passion that\r\npromises easily to pass and be changed into love.\r\n\r\n“To be safe against deceits, some men love another sort of women, who\r\nare so free of eye and word and movement as to do the first thing that\r\ncomes into their mind with a certain simplicity which does not hide\r\ntheir thoughts. Nor are there lacking other generous souls,\r\nwho—(esteeming that worth is shown in difficulty, and that it would be a\r\nvictory most sweet to conquer what to others seems unconquerable), in\r\norder to give proof that their valour is able to force a stubborn mind\r\nand persuade to love even wills that are contrary and recusant\r\nthereto,—readily turn to love the beauties of those women who by eyes\r\nand words and behaviour show more austere severity than the others.\r\nWherefore these men who are so self-confident, and who account\r\nthemselves secure against being deceived, willingly love certain women\r\nalso who by cunning and art seem to conceal a thousand wiles with\r\nbeauty; or else some others, who along with their beauty have a\r\ncoquettishly disdainful manner of few words and few laughs, with almost\r\nan air of prizing little every man who looks upon them or serves them.\r\n\r\n“Then there are certain other men who deign to love only those women who\r\nin face and speech and every movement carry all elegance, all gentle\r\nmanners, all knowledge, and all the graces heaped together,—like a\r\nsingle flower composed of all the excellences in the world. Thus if my\r\nCourt Lady have a dearth of those loves that spring from evil hope, she\r\nwill not on that account be left without a lover; for she will not lack\r\nthose loves that spring both from her merits and from her lovers’\r\nconfidence in their own worth, whereby they will know themselves to be\r\nworthy of being loved by her.”\r\n\r\n60.—Messer Roberto still objected, but my lady Duchess held him in the\r\nwrong, supporting my lord Magnifico’s argument; then she continued:\r\n\r\n“We have no cause to complain of my lord Magnifico, for I truly think\r\nthat the Court Lady described by him may stand on a par with the\r\nCourtier, and even with some advantage; for he has taught her how to\r\nlove, which these gentlemen did not do for their Courtier.”\r\n\r\nThen the Unico Aretino said:\r\n\r\n“It is very fitting to teach women how to love, for rarely have I seen\r\nany that knew how: since they nearly all accompany their beauty with\r\ncruelty and ingratitude towards those who serve them most faithfully and\r\ndeserve the reward of their love by nobility of birth, gentleness and\r\nworth; and then they often give themselves a prey to men who are very\r\nsilly, base, and of small account, and who not only love them not, but\r\nhate them.\r\n\r\n“So, to avoid such grievous errours as these, perhaps it was well to\r\nteach them first how to make choice of a man who shall deserve to be\r\nloved, and then how to love him; which is not needful in the case of\r\nmen, who know it but too well of themselves. And here I can be a good\r\nwitness; for love was never taught me save by the divine beauty and\r\ndivinest behaviour of a Lady whom it was beyond my power not to adore,\r\nwherein I had no need of art or any master;[425] and I think that the\r\nsame happens with all who love truly. Hence it were fitting to teach the\r\nCourtier how to make himself loved rather than how to love.”\r\n\r\n61.—Here my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“Then discourse of this now, my lord Unico.”\r\n\r\nThe Unico replied:\r\n\r\n“Methinks reason would require that ladies’ favour should be won by\r\nserving and pleasing them; but by what they deem themselves served and\r\npleased, I think must needs be learned from ladies themselves, who often\r\ndesire things so strange that there is no man who would imagine the\r\nsame, and sometimes they do not themselves know what they desire. Hence\r\nit is right that you, my Lady, who are a woman and so must surely know\r\nwhat pleases women, should undertake this task, to do the world so great\r\na benefit.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Emilia said:\r\n\r\n“The very great favour that you always find with women is good proof\r\nthat you know all the ways by which their grace is won; hence it is\r\nquite fitting that you should teach them.”\r\n\r\n“My Lady,” replied the Unico, “I could give a lover no more useful\r\nwarning than to look to it that you have no influence over the lady\r\nwhose favour he seeks; for such good qualities as the world once thought\r\nwere in me, together with the sincerest love that ever was, have not had\r\nso much power to make me loved as you have to make me hated.”\r\n\r\n62.—Then my lady Emilia replied:\r\n\r\n“My lord Unico, God forbid that I should even think, much less do,\r\nanything to make you hated; for besides doing what I ought not, I should\r\nbe esteemed of little sense for attempting the impossible. But since you\r\nurge me thus to speak of that which pleases women, I will speak; and if\r\nyou shall be displeased, blame yourself for it.\r\n\r\n“I think, then, that whoever would be loved must love and be lovable;\r\nand that these two things suffice to win women’s favour.\r\n\r\n“Now to answer that which you accuse me of, I say that everyone knows\r\nand sees that you are very lovable; but whether you love as sincerely as\r\nyou say, I am very much in doubt, and perhaps the others too. For your\r\nbeing too lovable has brought it to pass that you have been loved by\r\nmany women: and great rivers divided into many parts become little\r\nstreams; so love, bestowed upon more than one object, has little\r\nstrength. But these continual laments of yours, and complaints of\r\ningratitude in the women you have served (which is not probable, in view\r\nof your great merits), are a certain sort of mystery to hide the\r\nfavours, contentments and pleasures attained by you in love, and to\r\nassure the women who love you and have given themselves to you, that you\r\nwill not betray them; and hence also they are content that you should\r\nthus openly display feigned love for others to hide their real love for\r\nyou. So, if the women whom you now pretend to love are not so ready to\r\nbelieve it as you would like, the reason is because this artfulness of\r\nyours in love is beginning to be understood, not because I make you\r\nhated.”\r\n\r\n63.—Then my lord Unico said:\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to try again to confute your words, because I at last\r\nperceive that it is as much my fate not to be believed when I say truth,\r\nas it is yours to be believed when you say untruth.”\r\n\r\n“Say rather, my lord Unico,” replied by lady Emilia, “that you do not\r\nlove as you would have us believe; for if you loved, all your desire\r\nwould be to please your beloved lady and to wish what she wishes,\r\nbecause this is the law of love; but your thus complaining of her\r\ndenotes some deceit, as I said, or indeed gives proof that you wish what\r\nshe does not wish.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said my lord Unico, “indeed I wish what she wishes, which is\r\nproof that I love her; but I complain that she does not wish what I\r\nwish, which is a token that she loves me not, according to that same\r\nrule that you have cited.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia replied:\r\n\r\n“He who begins to love ought also to begin to please his beloved and\r\nbend himself wholly to her wishes, and govern his by hers; and make his\r\nown desires her slaves, and his very soul like unto an obedient\r\nhandmaid, nor ever think of aught but to let it be transformed, if\r\npossible, into that of his beloved, and to account this as his highest\r\nhappiness; for they do thus who love truly.”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly,” said my lord Unico, “my highest happiness would be to have\r\na single wish rule her soul and mine.”\r\n\r\n“It rests with you to have it so,” replied my lady Emilia.\r\n\r\n64.—Then messer Bernardo interrupted and said:\r\n\r\n“Certain it is that he who loves truly bends all his thoughts to serve\r\nand please the lady of his love, without being shown the way by others;\r\nbut as these loving services are sometimes not clearly perceived, I\r\nthink that besides loving and serving it is further necessary to make\r\nsome other demonstration of his love so evident that the lady cannot\r\nhide her knowledge that she is loved; yet with such modesty withal that\r\nhe may not seem to have small respect for her. And since you, my Lady,\r\nbegan to tell how the lover’s soul must be the obedient handmaid of his\r\nbeloved, I pray you explain this secret also, which seems to me very\r\nimportant.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“If the lover is so modest that he is ashamed to tell her of his love,\r\nlet him write it to her.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia added:\r\n\r\n“Nay, if he is as discreet as becomes him, he ought to be sure of not\r\noffending her before he declares himself to her.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“All women like to be sued in love, even though they mean to refuse that\r\nwhich they are sued for.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“You are very wrong; nor should I advise the Courtier ever to employ\r\nthis method, unless he be certain of not being repulsed.”\r\n\r\n65.—“Then what is he to do?” said my lord Gaspar.\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico continued:\r\n\r\n“If he must speak or write, let him do it with such modesty and so\r\nwarily that his first words shall try her mind, and shall touch so\r\nambiguously upon her wish as to leave a way and certain loophole that\r\nmay enable her to feign not to see that his discourse imports love, to\r\nthe end that he may retreat in case of difficulty and pretend that he\r\nspoke or wrote to some other end, in order to enjoy in safety those\r\nintimate caresses and coquetries that a woman often grants to him who\r\nshe thinks accepts them in friendship, and then withholds them as soon\r\nas she finds they are received as demonstrations of love. Hence those\r\nmen who are too precipitate and venture thus presumptuously with a kind\r\nof fury and stubbornness, often lose these favours, and deservedly; for\r\nevery noble lady regards herself as little esteemed by him who rudely\r\nwooes her before having done her service.\r\n\r\n66.—“Therefore in my opinion the way that the Courtier ought to take to\r\nmake his love known to the Lady, seems to me to be by showing it to her\r\nin manner rather than in words;—for verily more of love’s affection is\r\nsometimes revealed in a sigh, in reverence, in timidity, than in a\r\nthousand words;—next by making his eyes to be faithful messengers to\r\nbear the embassies of his heart, since they often show the passion that\r\nis within more clearly than the tongue itself or letters or other\r\ncouriers: so that they not only disclose thoughts, but often kindle love\r\nin the beloved’s heart. Because those quick spirits that issue from the\r\neyes, being generated near the heart, enter again by the eyes (whither\r\nthey are aimed like an arrow at the mark), and naturally reach the heart\r\nas if it were their abode, and mingling with those other spirits there\r\nand with that subtle quality of blood which they have in them, they\r\ninfect the blood near the heart to which they have come, and warm it,\r\nand make it like themselves and ready to receive the impression of that\r\nimage which they have brought with them. Travelling thus to and fro over\r\nthe road from eyes to heart, and bringing back the tinder and steel of\r\nbeauty and grace, little by little these messengers fan with the breath\r\nof desire that fire which glows so ardently and never ceases to burn\r\nbecause they are always bringing it the fuel of hope to feed on.\r\n\r\n“Hence it may be well said that eyes are the guide in love, especially\r\nif they are kind and soft; black, of a bright and gentle blackness, or\r\nblue; merry and laughing, so gracious and keen of glance, like some\r\nwherein the channels that give the spirits egress seem so deep that\r\nthrough them we can see the very heart. Then the eyes lie in wait, just\r\nas in war soldiers lurk in ambush; and if the form of the whole body is\r\nfair and well proportioned, it attracts and allures anyone who looks\r\nupon it from afar until he approaches, and, as soon as he is near, the\r\neyes dart forth and bewitch like sorcerers; and especially when they\r\nsend out their rays straight to the eyes of the beloved at a moment when\r\nthese are doing the same; because the spirits meet, and in that sweet\r\nencounter each receives the other’s quality, as we see in the case of an\r\neye diseased, which by looking fixedly into a sound one imparts thereto\r\nits own disease. So methinks in this way our Courtier can in great part\r\nmanifest his love for his Lady.\r\n\r\n“True it is that if the eyes are not governed with skill, they often\r\nmost disclose a man’s amourous desires to whom he least would do so; for\r\nthrough them there shines forth almost visibly that ardent passion which\r\n(while wishing to reveal it only to his beloved) the lover often reveals\r\nalso to those from whom he most would hide it. Therefore he who has not\r\nlost the bridle of reason, governs himself cautiously and observes time\r\nand place, and abstains when needful from such intent gazing, sweetest\r\nfood though it be; for an open love is too difficult a thing.”\r\n\r\n67.—Count Ludovico replied:\r\n\r\n“Sometimes even openness does no harm, for in this case men often think\r\nsuch a love affair is not tending to the end which every lover desires,\r\nseeing that little care is taken to hide it, nor any heed given whether\r\nit be known or not; and so, by not denying it, a man wins a certain\r\nfreedom that enables him to speak openly with his beloved and to be with\r\nher without suspicion; which those do not win who try to be secret,\r\nbecause they seem to hope for and to be near some great reward that they\r\nwould not have others discover.\r\n\r\n“Moreover I have often seen very ardent love spring up in a woman’s\r\nheart towards a man for whom she had at first not had the least\r\naffection, simply from hearing that many deemed them to be in love; and\r\nI think the reason of this was because such an universal opinion as that\r\nseemed to her sufficient proof to make her believe the man worthy of her\r\nlove, and it seemed as if report brought her messages from the lover\r\nmuch truer and worthier of belief than he himself could have sent by\r\nletters and words, or another for him.\r\n\r\n“Thus, this public report not only sometimes does no harm, but helps.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Love affairs that have report for their minister put a man in great\r\ndanger of being pointed at with the finger; and hence he who would\r\ntravel this road safely, must feign to have less fire within him than he\r\nhas, and content himself with that which seems little to him, and\r\nconceal his desires, jealousies, griefs and joys, and often laugh with\r\nhis mouth when his heart is weeping, and feign to be prodigal of that\r\nwhereof he most is chary; and these things are so difficult to do, that\r\nthey are almost impossible. Therefore if our Courtier would follow my\r\nadvice, I should exhort him to keep his love affairs secret.”\r\n\r\n68.—Then messer Bernardo said:\r\n\r\n“There is need, then, for you to teach him how, and methinks it is of no\r\nsmall importance; for, besides the signals which men sometimes make so\r\ncovertly that almost without a motion the person whom they wish reads in\r\ntheir face and eyes what is in their heart,—I have sometimes heard a\r\nlong and free love talk between two lovers, of which, however, those\r\npresent could understand clearly no details at all or even be sure that\r\nthe talk was about love. And the reason of this lay in the speakers’\r\ndiscretion and precaution; for without showing any sign of annoyance at\r\nbeing listened to, they whispered only those words that signified, and\r\nspoke aloud the rest, which could be construed in different senses.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Federico said:\r\n\r\n“To speak thus minutely about these precautions of secrecy would be a\r\njourney into the infinite; hence I would rather have some little\r\ndiscussion as to how the lover ought to maintain his lady’s favour,\r\nwhich seems to me much more necessary.”\r\n\r\n69.—The Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“I think that those means which serve to win it serve also to maintain\r\nit; and all this consists in pleasing the lady of our love without ever\r\noffending her. Wherefore it would be difficult to give any fixed rule\r\nfor it; since in countless ways he who is not very discreet sometimes\r\nmakes mistakes that seem little and yet grievously offend the lady’s\r\nspirit; and this befalls those, more than others, who are overmastered\r\nby passion: like some who, whenever they have means of speaking to the\r\nlady whom they love, lament and complain so bitterly and often wish for\r\nthings that are so impossible, that they become wearisome by their very\r\nimportunity. Others, when they are stung by any jealousy, allow\r\nthemselves to be so carried away by their grief that they heedlessly run\r\ninto speaking evil of him whom they suspect, and sometimes without fault\r\neither on his part or on the lady’s, and insist that she shall not speak\r\nto him or even turn her eyes in the direction where he is. And by this\r\nbehaviour they often not only offend the lady, but are the cause that\r\nleads her to love the man: because the fear that lovers sometimes\r\ndisplay lest their lady forsake them for another, shows that they are\r\nconscious of being inferior to him in merits and worth, and with this\r\nidea the lady is moved to love him, and perceiving that evil is said of\r\nhim to put him out of favour, she believes it not although it be true,\r\nand loves him all the more.”\r\n\r\n70.—Then messer Cesare said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“I own I am not so wise that I could abstain from speaking evil of my\r\nrival, except you were to teach me some other better means of ruining\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Magnifico replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“There is a proverb which says that when our enemy is in the water up to\r\nthe belt, we must offer him our hand and lift him out of peril; but when\r\nhe is in up to the chin, we must set our foot on his head and drown him\r\noutright. Thus there are some who do this with their rival, and as long\r\nas they have no safe way of ruining him, go about dissimulating and\r\npretend to be rather his friend than otherwise; then if an opportunity\r\noffers—such that they know they can overwhelm him with certain ruin by\r\nsaying all manner of evil of him (whether it be true or false),—they do\r\nit without mercy, with craft, deception and all the means they know how\r\nto invent.\r\n\r\n“But since it would never please me to have our Courtier use any deceit,\r\nI would have him deprive his rival of the lady’s favour by no other\r\ncraft than by loving and serving her, and by being worthy, valiant,\r\ndiscreet and modest; in short, by deserving her better than his rival,\r\nand by being in all things wary and prudent, abstaining from all stupid\r\nfollies, wherein many dunces fall and in diverse ways. For in the past I\r\nhave known some who use Poliphilian words in writing and speaking to\r\nwomen,[426] and so insist upon the niceties of rhetoric, that the women\r\nare diffident of themselves and account themselves very ignorant, and\r\nthink each hour of such discourse a thousand years, and rise before the\r\nend. Others are immoderately boastful. Others often say things that\r\nredound to their own discredit and damage, like some I am wont to laugh\r\nat, who profess to be in love and sometimes say in the presence of\r\nwomen: ‘I have never found a woman to love me;’ and they do not perceive\r\nthat those who hear them at once conclude that this can arise from no\r\nother reason than that they deserve neither love nor the water they\r\ndrink, and hold them for men of slight account, and would not love them\r\nfor all the gold in the world, thinking that to love them would be to\r\nstand lower than all the other women who loved them not.\r\n\r\n“Still others are so silly that for the purpose of bringing odium upon\r\nsome rival of theirs, they say in the presence of women: ‘So and So is\r\nthe luckiest man on earth; for although he is not at all handsome,\r\ndiscreet or valiant, and cannot do or say more than the rest, yet all\r\nthe women love him and run after him;’ and thus showing themselves to be\r\nenvious of the man’s good luck, they incite belief that (although he\r\nshows himself to be lovable in neither looks nor acts) he has in him\r\nsome hidden quality for which he deserves so many women’s love; hence\r\nthose who hear him thus spoken of are by this belief even much more\r\nmoved to love him.”\r\n\r\n71.—Then Count Ludovico laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“I assure you that the discreet Courtier will never use these\r\nstupidities to win favour with women.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare Gonzaga replied:\r\n\r\n“Nor yet that one which was used in my time by a gentleman of great\r\nrepute, whose name for the honour of men I will not mention.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess replied:\r\n\r\n“At least tell what he did.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare continued:\r\n\r\n“Being loved by a great lady, at her request he came secretly to the\r\nplace where she was; and after he had seen her and conversed with her as\r\nlong as she and the time allowed, taking his leave with many bitter\r\ntears and sighs, in token of the extreme sorrow that he felt at such a\r\nparting, he besought her to keep him continually in mind; and then he\r\nadded that she ought to pay his board and lodging, for as he had been\r\ninvited by her, it seemed to him reasonable that he should be at no\r\ncharge for his coming.”\r\n\r\nThen all the ladies began to laugh and to say that he was quite unworthy\r\nto be called a gentleman; and many of the men were ashamed, with that\r\nshame which the man himself would have rightly felt if he had at any\r\ntime found wit enough to be conscious of such a shameful fault.\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar then turned to messer Cesare, and said:\r\n\r\n“It was better to refrain from telling this thing for the honour of\r\nwomen, than to refrain for the honour of men from naming him; for you\r\ncan well imagine what good judgment that great lady had in loving such a\r\nsenseless animal, and also that of the many who served her perhaps she\r\nhad chosen this one as the most discreet, forsaking and misliking men\r\nwhose lackey he was unworthy to be.”\r\n\r\nCount Ludovico laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“Who knows that he was not discreet in other things, and failed only as\r\nto board and lodging? But many times men commit great follies in their\r\nexcessive love; and if you will say the truth, perhaps it has befallen\r\nyou to commit more than one.”\r\n\r\n72.—Messer Cesare replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“By your faith, do not expose our errours.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, it is necessary to expose them,” replied my lord Gaspar, “in order\r\nthat we may know how to correct them;” then he added: “My lord\r\nMagnifico, now that the Courtier knows how to win and maintain his\r\nlady’s favour and to deprive his rival of it, you must teach him how to\r\nkeep his love affairs secret.”\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied:\r\n\r\n“Methinks I have said enough; so now choose someone else to speak of\r\nthis secrecy.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo and all the others began to urge him anew; and the\r\nMagnifico said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“You wish to tempt me. All of you are too well practised in love: yet if\r\nyou would know more, go read it in Ovid.”\r\n\r\n“And how,” said messer Bernardo, “should I hope that his precepts are of\r\nany service in love, when he recommends and says it is a very good thing\r\nthat a man should pretend to be drunk in the presence of the\r\nbeloved?[427] See what a fine way of winning favour! And he cites as a\r\nfine method of making one’s love known to a lady at a banquet, to dip a\r\nfinger in wine and write it on the table.”[428]\r\n\r\nThe Magnifico replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“In those days it was not amiss.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore,” said messer Bernardo, “since such a filthy trick as\r\nthis was not offensive to the men of that time, we may believe that they\r\ndid not have so gentle a manner of serving women in love as we have. But\r\nlet us not forsake our first subject, of teaching how to keep love\r\nsecret.”\r\n\r\n73.—Then the Magnifico said:\r\n\r\n“In my opinion, in order to keep love secret it is needful to avoid the\r\ncauses that make it public, which are many; but there is one chief\r\ncause, which is the wish to be too secret and not trust any person\r\nwhatever. For every lover desires to make his passion known to his\r\nbeloved, and being alone he is forced to make many more and stronger\r\ndemonstrations than if he were aided by some loving and faithful friend;\r\nbecause the demonstrations that the lover himself makes arouse much\r\ngreater suspicion than those he makes through intermediaries. And since\r\nthe human mind is naturally curious to find things out, as soon as a\r\nstranger begins to suspect, he employs such diligence that he learns the\r\ntruth, and having learned it, makes no scruple to publish it—nay,\r\nsometimes delights to do so; which is not the case with a friend, who\r\nbesides helping with comfort and advice, often repairs those mistakes\r\nwhich the blind lover commits, and always contrives secrecy and provides\r\nfor many things for which he himself cannot provide. Moreover very great\r\nrelief is felt in telling our passion and unburdening it to a trusty\r\nfriend, and likewise it greatly enhances our joys to be able to impart\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n74.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Another cause discloses love more than this.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it?” replied the Magnifico.\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar continued:\r\n\r\n“The vain ambition joined with madness and cruelty of women; who, as you\r\nyourself have said, try to have as great a number of lovers as they can,\r\nand if it were possible would have all of these burn and (once made\r\nashes) after death return alive to die once more. And even although they\r\nbe in love, still they delight in their lover’s torment, because they\r\nthink that pain and afflictions and continual calling for death give\r\ngood proof that they are loved, and can, by their beauty, make men\r\nwretched and happy, and bestow death and life, as they please. Hence\r\nthey feed only on this food, and are so eager for it that (in order not\r\nto be without it) they do not satisfy or ever quite dishearten their\r\nlovers; but to keep these continually in anguish and desire, they use a\r\ncertain domineering severity of threats mingled with encouragement, and\r\nfain would have a word, a look, a nod of theirs esteemed as highest\r\nbliss. And to be deemed modest and chaste, not only by their lovers but\r\nby all the rest, they take care to make their harsh and discourteous\r\nbehaviour public, to the end that everyone may think that if they thus\r\nmaltreat those who are worthy to be loved, they must treat the unworthy\r\nmuch worse.\r\n\r\n“And in this belief, thinking they thus have artfully made themselves\r\nsecure against infamy, they often spend every night with vilest men whom\r\nthey scarcely know; and so, to enjoy the calamities and continual\r\nlaments of some noble cavalier whom they love, they deny themselves\r\nthose pleasures which they might perhaps attain with some excuse; and\r\nthey are the cause that forces the poor lover in sheer desperation to\r\nbehaviour which brings to light that which every care ought to be taken\r\nto keep most secret.\r\n\r\n“Some others there are, who, if by trickery they succeed in leading many\r\na man to think himself loved by them, nourish the jealousy of each by\r\nbestowing caresses and favour on one in the presence of another; and\r\nwhen they see that he too whom they most love is nearly sure of being\r\nloved because of the demonstrations shown him, they often put him in\r\nsuspense by ambiguous words and pretended anger, and pierce his heart,\r\nfeigning to care nothing for him and to wish to give themselves wholly\r\nto another; whence arise hatreds, enmities and countless scandals and\r\nmanifest ruin, for in such a case a man must show the passion that he\r\nfeels, even though it result in blame and infamy to the lady.\r\n\r\n“Others, not content with this single torment of jealousy, after the\r\nlover has given all proofs of love and faithful service, and after they\r\nhave received the same with some sign of returning it with good will,\r\nthey begin to draw back without cause and when it is least expected, and\r\npretend to believe that he has grown lukewarm, and feigning new\r\nsuspicions that they are not loved, they give sign of wishing to break\r\nwith him absolutely. And so, because of these obstacles, the poor fellow\r\nis by very force compelled to go back to the start and pay court as if\r\nhis service were beginning; and daily to walk the earth, and when the\r\nlady stirs abroad to accompany her to church and everywhere she goes,\r\nnever to turn his eyes another way: and now he returns to plaints and\r\nsighs and heaviness of heart, and if he can speak with her, to\r\nsupplications, blasphemies, despairings, and all those ragings to which\r\nunhappy lovers are put by these fierce monsters, who have a greater\r\nthirst for blood than tigers have.\r\n\r\n75.—“Such woeful demonstrations as these are but too much seen and\r\nknown, and often more by others than by her who occasions them; and thus\r\nin a few days they become so public that not a step can be taken, nor\r\nthe least signal given, that is not noted by a thousand eyes. Then it\r\nhappens that long before there are any sweets of love between them, they\r\nare believed and judged by all the world; for when women see that the\r\nlover, now nigh to death and overwhelmed by the cruelty and tortures\r\ninflicted on him, is firmly and really resolving to withdraw, they at\r\nonce begin to show him that they love him heartily, and to do him all\r\nmanner of kindness, and to yield to him, to the end that (his ardent\r\ndesire having failed) the fruits of love may be less sweet to him and he\r\nmay have less to thank them for, in order to do everything amiss.\r\n\r\n“And their love being now very well known, at the same time all the\r\nresults that proceed from it are also very well known; thus the women\r\nare dishonoured, and the lover finds that he has lost time and pains and\r\nhas shortened his life in sorrows, without the least advantage or\r\npleasure; for he attained his desires, not when they would have made him\r\nvery happy with their pleasantness, but when he cared little or nothing\r\nfor them, because his heart was already so deadened by his cruel passion\r\nthat it had no feeling left wherewith to enjoy the delight or\r\ncontentment which was offered him.”\r\n\r\n76.—Then my lord Ottaviano said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“You held your peace awhile and refrained from saying evil of women;\r\nthen you hit them so hard that it seems as if you were gathering\r\nstrength, like those who draw back in order to strike the harder; and\r\nverily you are in the wrong and ought henceforth to be gentler.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia laughed, and turning to my lady Duchess, said:\r\n\r\n“You see, my Lady, that our adversaries are beginning to quarrel and\r\ndiffer among themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Call me not so,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “for I am not your\r\nadversary. This contest has displeased me much, not because I was sorry\r\nto see the victory in favour of women, but because it has led my lord\r\nGaspar to revile them more than he ought, and my lord Magnifico and\r\nmesser Cesare to praise them perhaps a little more than their due;\r\nbesides which, owing to the length of the discussion, we have missed\r\nhearing many other fine things that remained to say about the Courtier.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” said my lady Emilia, “that you are our adversary after all;\r\nand for that reason you are displeased with the late discussion, and\r\nfain would not have had so excellent a Court Lady described; not because\r\nyou had anything more to say about the Courtier (for these gentlemen\r\nhave said all they knew, and I think that neither you nor anyone else\r\ncould add anything whatever), but because of the envy that you have of\r\nwomen’s honour.”\r\n\r\n77.—“Certain it is,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “that besides the things\r\nthat have been said about the Courtier, I should like to hear many\r\nothers. Still, since everyone is content to have him as he is, I also am\r\ncontent; nor should I change him in aught else, unless in making him a\r\nlittle more friendly to women than my lord Gaspar is, albeit perhaps not\r\nso much so as some of these other gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“By all means we must see whether your talents are so great that they\r\ncan give the Courtier greater perfection than these gentlemen have given\r\nhim. So please to say what you have in mind: else we shall think that\r\neven you cannot add anything to what has been said, but that you wished\r\nto detract from the praises of the Court Lady because you think her the\r\nequal of the Courtier, who you would therefore have us believe could be\r\nmuch more perfect than these gentlemen have described him.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“The praise and censure that have been bestowed on women beyond their\r\ndue have so filled the ears and mind of the company as to leave no room\r\nfor anything else to lodge; besides this, in my opinion the hour is very\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said my lady Duchess, “we shall have more time by waiting till\r\nto-morrow; and meanwhile this praise and censure, which you say have\r\nbeen on both sides bestowed excessively on women, will leave these\r\ngentlemen’s minds, and thus they will better appreciate that truth which\r\nyou will tell them.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, my lady Duchess rose to her feet, and courteously dismissing\r\nthe company, retired to her more private room, and everyone went to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n                     BY COUNT BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO\r\n\r\n1.—Thinking to write out the discussions that were held on the fourth\r\nevening, after those mentioned in the previous Books, among various\r\nreflections I feel one bitter thought that strikes my heart, and makes\r\nme mindful of human miseries and our deceptive hopes: and how fortune,\r\noften in mid-course and sometimes near the end, shatters our frail and\r\nvain designs, and sometimes wrecks them before the haven can be even\r\nseen afar.\r\n\r\nThus I recall that not long after these discussions took place,\r\nimportunate death deprived our court of three very rare gentlemen while\r\nthey were in the flower of robust health and hope of honour. And of\r\nthese the first was my lord Gaspar Pallavicino, who being assailed by an\r\nacute disease and more than once brought low, although his courage was\r\nof such vigour that for a season it held spirit and body together in\r\nspite of death, yet ended his natural course far before his time;[429] a\r\nvery great loss not only to our court and to his friends and family, but\r\nto his native land and to all Lombardy.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards died messer Cesare Gonzaga, who to all those who had\r\nacquaintance with him left a bitter and painful memory of his\r\ndeath;[430] for since nature produces such men as rarely as she does, it\r\nseemed only fitting that she should not so soon deprive us of this one:\r\nbecause it certainly may be said that messer Cesare was carried off just\r\nwhen he was beginning to give something more than promise of himself,\r\nand to be esteemed as his admirable qualities deserved; for already, by\r\nmany meritorious efforts he had given good proof of his worth, which\r\nshone forth not only in noble birth, but also in the ornament of letters\r\nand of arms, and in every kind of laudable behaviour; so that, by reason\r\nof his goodness, capacity, courage and wisdom, there was nothing so\r\ngreat that it might not be expected from him.\r\n\r\nNo long time passed before the death of messer Roberto da Bari also\r\ninflicted deep sorrow upon the whole court;[48] for it seemed reasonable\r\nthat everyone should lament the death of a youth of good behaviour,\r\nagreeable, fair of aspect, and of very rare personal grace, and of as\r\nstout and sturdy temper as could be wished.\r\n\r\n2.—If, then, these men had lived, I think they would have reached such\r\neminence that they would have been able to give everyone who knew them\r\nclear proof how worthy the court of Urbino was of praise, and how\r\nadorned with noble cavaliers; which nearly all the others have done who\r\nwere reared there. For verily the Trojan Horse did not send forth so\r\nmany lords and captains as this court has sent forth men singular in\r\nworth and most highly prized by everyone. Thus, as you know, messer\r\nFederico Fregoso was made Archbishop of Salerno; Count Ludovico, Bishop\r\nof Bayeux; my lord Ottaviano, Doge of Genoa; messer Bernardo Bibbiena,\r\nCardinal of Santa Maria in Portico; messer Pietro Bembo, secretary to\r\nPope Leo; my lord Magnifico rose to the dukedom of Nemours and to that\r\ngreatness where he now is. My lord Francesco Maria della Rovere also,\r\nPrefect of Rome, was made Duke of Urbino:[431] albeit much higher praise\r\nmay be accorded to the court where he was nurtured, because he there\r\nbecame a rare and excellent lord in every quality of worth, as we now\r\nsee, than because he attained the dukedom of Urbino; nor do I believe\r\nthat a small cause of this was the noble company in whose daily converse\r\nhe always saw and heard laudable behaviour.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to me that the cause, whether chance or favour of the\r\nstars, which has so long granted excellent lords to Urbino, still\r\ncontinues and produces the same results; and hence we may hope that fair\r\nfortune must further so bless these good works, that the welfare of the\r\nhouse and state shall not only not wane but rather wax from day to day:\r\nand of this many bright auguries are already to be seen, among which I\r\nesteem the chief to be Heaven’s bestowal of such a mistress as is my\r\nlady Eleanora Gonzaga, the new Duchess;[432] for if ever in a single\r\nbody there were joined wisdom, grace, beauty, capacity, tact, humanity,\r\nand every other gentle quality,—in her they are so united that they form\r\na chain which completes and adorns her every movement with all these\r\nqualities at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ELEANORA GONZAGA\r\n  DUCHESS OF URBINO\r\n  1492-1543\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from the central part of Braun’s photograph (no. 34.106) of the\r\n    picture _Das Mädchen im Pelz_, in the Imperial Museum at Vienna, by\r\n    Titian (1477-1576).\r\n\r\nLet us now continue the discussion about our Courtier, in the hope that\r\nafter us there ought to be no lack of those who will find bright and\r\nhonoured examples of worth in the present court of Urbino, just as we\r\nnow do in that of bygone times.\r\n\r\n3.—It seemed, then, as my lord Gaspar Pallavicino used to relate, that\r\nthe following day after the discussions contained in the preceding Book,\r\nlittle was seen of my lord Ottaviano; hence many thought that he had\r\nretired in order that he might without hindrance think carefully of what\r\nhe had to say. Thus, the company having betaken themselves to my lady\r\nDuchess at the accustomed hour, search had to be made far and wide for\r\nmy lord Ottaviano, who did not appear for a good space; so that many\r\ncavaliers and maids of honour of the court began to dance and engage in\r\nother pastimes, thinking that for that evening there would be no more\r\ntalk about the Courtier. And indeed all were busied, some with one thing\r\nand some with another, when my lord Ottaviano arrived, after he had\r\nalmost been given up; and seeing that messer Cesare Gonzaga and my lord\r\nGaspar were dancing, he bowed to my lady Duchess and said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“I quite expected to hear my lord Gaspar say some evil about women again\r\nthis evening; but seeing him dance with one, I think that he has made\r\nhis peace with all of them; and I am glad that the dispute (or rather\r\nthe discussion) about the Courtier has ended thus.”\r\n\r\n“It is by no means ended,” replied my lady Duchess; “for I am no such\r\nenemy of men as you are of women, and therefore I am unwilling that the\r\nCourtier should be deprived of his due honour, and of those ornaments\r\nthat you promised him last evening;” and so saying, she directed that as\r\nsoon as the dance was finished, everyone should sit down in the usual\r\norder, which was done; and when all were giving close attention, my lord\r\nOttaviano said:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, since my wish to have the Courtier possess many other good\r\nqualities is taken as a promise to tell what they are, I am content to\r\nspeak about them, not with any hope of saying all that might be said,\r\nbut merely enough to clear your mind of the charge that was made against\r\nme last evening, to wit: that I spoke as I did rather for the purpose of\r\ndetracting from the Court Lady’s praises (by raising a false belief that\r\nother excellences can be ascribed to the Courtier, and by thus artfully\r\nmaking him her superior), than because what I said was true. Wherefore,\r\nto adapt myself to the hour, which is later than it is wont to be when\r\nwe begin our discussions, I shall be brief.\r\n\r\n4.—“So, to pursue these gentlemen’s discourse, which I wholly approve\r\nand confirm, I say that of the things that we call good, there are some\r\nwhich simply and in themselves are always good, like temperance,\r\nfortitude, health, and all the virtues that bestow tranquillity upon the\r\nmind; others, which are good in various respects and for the object to\r\nwhich they tend, like law, liberality, riches, and other like things.\r\nHence I think that the perfect Courtier, such as Count Ludovico and\r\nmesser Federico have described, may be a truly good thing and worthy of\r\npraise, not however simply and in himself, but in respect to the end to\r\nwhich he may be directed. For indeed if by being nobly born, graceful,\r\nagreeable, and expert in so many exercises, the Courtier brought forth\r\nno other fruit than merely being what he is, I should not deem it right\r\nfor a man to devote so much study and pains to acquiring this perfection\r\nof Courtiership, as anyone must who wishes to attain it. Nay, I should\r\nsay that many of those accomplishments that have been ascribed to him\r\n(like dancing, merry-making, singing and playing) were follies and\r\nvanities, and in a man of rank worthy rather of censure than of praise:\r\nfor these elegances, devices, mottoes, and other like things that\r\npertain to discourse about women and love, although perhaps many other\r\nmen think the contrary, often serve only to effeminate the mind, to\r\ncorrupt youth, and to reduce it to great wantonness of living; whence\r\nthen it comes to pass that the Italian name is brought into opprobrium,\r\nand but few are to be found who dare, I will not say to die, but even to\r\nrun into danger.\r\n\r\n“And surely there are countless other things, which, if industry and\r\nstudy were spent upon them, would be of much greater utility in both\r\npeace and war than this kind of Courtiership in itself merely; but if\r\nthe Courtier’s actions are directed to that good end to which they\r\nought, and which I have in mind, methinks they are not only not harmful\r\nor vain, but very useful and deserving of infinite praise.\r\n\r\n5.—“I think then that the aim of the perfect Courtier, which has not\r\nbeen spoken of till now, is so to win for himself, by means of the\r\naccomplishments ascribed to him by these gentlemen, the favour and mind\r\nof the prince whom he serves, that he may be able to say, and always\r\nshall say, the truth about everything which it is fitting for the prince\r\nto know, without fear or risk of giving offence thereby; and that when\r\nhe sees his prince’s mind inclined to do something wrong, he may be\r\nquick to oppose, and gently to make use of the favour acquired by his\r\ngood accomplishments, so as to banish every bad intent and lead his\r\nprince into the path of virtue. And thus, possessing the goodness which\r\nthese gentlemen have described, together with readiness of wit and\r\npleasantness, and shrewdness and knowledge of letters and many other\r\nthings,—the Courtier will in every case be able deftly to show the\r\nprince how much honour and profit accrue to him and his from justice,\r\nliberality, magnanimity, gentleness, and the other virtues that become a\r\ngood prince; and on the other hand how much infamy and loss proceed from\r\nthe vices opposed to them. Therefore I think that just as music,\r\nfestivals, games, and the other pleasant accomplishments are as it were\r\nthe flower, in like manner to lead or help one’s prince towards right,\r\nand to frighten him from wrong, are the true fruit of Courtiership.\r\n\r\n“And since the merit of well-doing lies chiefly in two things, one of\r\nwhich is the choice of an end for our intentions that shall be truly\r\ngood, and the other ability to find means suitable and fitting to\r\nconduce to that good end marked out,—certain it is that that man’s mind\r\ntends to the best end, who purposes to see to it that his prince shall\r\nbe deceived by no one, shall hearken not to flatterers or to slanderers\r\nand liars, and shall distinguish good and evil, and love the one and\r\nhate the other.\r\n\r\n6.—“Methinks, too, that the accomplishments ascribed to the Courtier by\r\nthese gentlemen may be a good means of arriving at that end; and this\r\nbecause among the many faults which to-day we see in many of our\r\nprinces, the greatest are ignorance and self-esteem. And the root of\r\nthese two evils is none other than falsehood: which vice is deservedly\r\nhateful to God and to men, and more injurious to princes than any other;\r\nbecause they have greatest lack of that whereof they most need to have\r\nabundance—I mean of someone to tell them the truth and to put them in\r\nmind of what is right: for their enemies are not moved by love to\r\nperform these offices, but are well pleased to have them live wickedly\r\nand never correct themselves; on the other hand, their enemies dare not\r\naccuse them openly, for fear of being punished. Then of their friends\r\nthere are few who have free access to them, and those few are chary of\r\ncensuring them for their errours as freely as in the case of private\r\npersons, and to win grace and favour often think of nothing but how to\r\nsuggest things that may delight and please their fancy, although the\r\nsame be evil and dishonourable; thus from being friends these men become\r\nflatterers, and to derive profit from their intimacy, always speak and\r\nact complaisantly, and for the most part make their way by means of\r\nfalsehoods, which beget ignorance in the prince’s mind, not only of\r\noutward things but of himself; and this may be said to be the greatest\r\nand most monstrous falsehood of all, for the ignorant mind deceives\r\nitself and lies inwardly to itself.\r\n\r\n7.—“From this it follows that, besides never hearing the truth about\r\nanything whatever, rulers are intoxicated by that licence which dominion\r\ncarries with it, and by the abundance of their enjoyments are drowned in\r\npleasures, and so deceive themselves and have their minds so\r\ncorrupted,—always finding themselves obeyed and almost adored with such\r\nreverence and praise, without the least censure or even\r\ncontradiction,—that from this ignorance they pass to boundless\r\nself-esteem, so that they then brook no advice or persuasion from\r\nothers. And since they think that to know how to rule is a very easy\r\nthing, and that to succeed therein they need no other art or training\r\nthan mere force, they bend their mind and all their thoughts to the\r\nmaintenance of that power which they have, esteeming that true felicity\r\nlies in being able to do what one likes.\r\n\r\n“Therefore some princes hate reason and justice, thinking that it would\r\nbe a kind of bridle and a means of reducing them to bondage, and of\r\nlessening the pleasure and satisfaction which they have in ruling, if\r\nthey were willing to follow it; and that their dominion would not be\r\nperfect or complete if they were constrained to obey duty and honour,\r\nbecause they think that he who obeys is no true ruler. Therefore,\r\nfollowing these principles and allowing themselves to be transported by\r\nself-esteem, they become arrogant, with haughty looks and stern\r\nbehaviour, with splendid dress, gold and gems, and by letting themselves\r\nbe almost never seen in public they think to win authority among men and\r\nto be held almost as gods. And to my thinking they are like the colossi\r\nthat last year were made at Rome the day of the festival in the Piazza\r\nd’Agone,[433] which outwardly showed a likeness to great men and horses\r\nin a triumph, and within were full of tow and rags. But princes of this\r\nsort are much worse, in that the colossi keep upright merely by their\r\ngreat weight; while the princes, since they are ill balanced within and\r\nplaced haphazard on uneven bases, fall to their ruin by reason of their\r\nown weight, and from one errour run into many; for their ignorance,\r\ntogether with the false belief that they cannot err and that the power\r\nwhich they have proceeds from their own wisdom, leads them to seize\r\nstates boldly by fair means or foul, whenever they can.\r\n\r\n8.—“But if they were resolved to know and to do that which they ought,\r\nthey would be as set on not ruling as they are set on ruling; for they\r\nwould perceive how monstrous and pernicious a thing it is when subjects,\r\nwho are to be governed, are wiser than the princes who are to govern.\r\n\r\n“You see that ignorance of music, of dancing, of horsemanship, is not\r\nharmful to any man; nevertheless, he who is no musician is ashamed and\r\ndares not sing in the presence of others, or dance if he knows not how,\r\nor ride if he has not a good seat. But from not knowing how to govern\r\npeople there spring so many woes, deaths, destructions, burnings,\r\nruins,—that it may be said to be the deadliest pest that is to be found\r\non earth. And yet some princes who are very ignorant of government are\r\nnot ashamed to undertake to govern, I will not say in the presence of\r\nfour or of six men, but before all the world, for their rank is set so\r\nhigh that all eyes gaze on them, and hence not only their great but\r\ntheir least defects are always noted. Thus it is written that Cimon was\r\naccused of loving wine, Scipio of loving sleep, Lucullus of loving\r\nfeasts.[434] But would to God that the princes of our time might couple\r\ntheir sins with as many virtues as did those ancients; who, although\r\nthey erred in some respects, yet did not avoid the reminders and advice\r\nof anyone who seemed to them competent to correct those errours, but\r\nrather sought with all solicitude to order their lives after the\r\nprecepts of excellent men: as Epaminondas after that of Lysis the\r\nPythagorean,[435] Agesilaus after that of Xenophon, Scipio after that of\r\nPanætius, and countless others.[436]\r\n\r\n“But if some of our princes were to happen upon a stern philosopher or\r\nany man who was willing openly and artlessly to show them the frightful\r\nface of true virtue, and to teach them what good behaviour is and what a\r\ngood prince’s life ought to be, I am certain that they would loathe him\r\nlike an asp, or in sooth deride him as a thing most vile.\r\n\r\n9.—“I say, then, that since princes are to-day so corrupted by evil\r\ncustoms and by ignorance and mistaken self-esteem, and since it is so\r\ndifficult to give them knowledge of the truth and lead them on to\r\nvirtue, and since men seek to enter into their favour by lies and\r\nflatteries and such vicious means,—the Courtier, by the aid of those\r\ngentle qualities that Count Ludovico and messer Federico have given him,\r\ncan with ease and should try to gain the good will and so charm the mind\r\nof his prince, that he shall win free and safe indulgence to speak of\r\neverything without being irksome. And if he be such as has been said, he\r\nwill accomplish this with little trouble, and thus be able always to\r\ndisclose the truth about all things with ease; and also to instil\r\ngoodness into his prince’s mind little by little, and to teach\r\ncontinence, fortitude, justice, temperance, by giving a taste of how\r\nmuch sweetness is hidden by the little bitterness that at first sight\r\nappears to him who withstands vice; which is always hurtful and\r\ndispleasing, and accompanied by infamy and blame, just as virtue is\r\nprofitable, blithe and full of praise. And thereto he will be able to\r\nincite his prince by the example of the famous captains and other\r\neminent men to whom the ancients were wont to make statues of bronze and\r\nof marble and sometimes of gold, and to erect the same in public places,\r\nboth for the honour of these men and as a stimulus to others, so that\r\nthey might be led by worthy emulation to strive to reach that glory too.\r\n\r\n10.—“In this way the Courtier will be able to lead his prince along the\r\nthorny path of virtue, decking it as with shady leafage and strewing it\r\nwith lovely flowers to relieve the tedium of the weary journey to one\r\nwhose strength is slight; and now with music, now with arms and horses,\r\nnow with verses, now with love talk, and with all those means whereof\r\nthese gentlemen have told, to keep his mind continually busied with\r\nworthy pleasures, yet always impressing upon him also, as I have said,\r\nsome virtuous practice along with these allurements, and playing upon\r\nhim with salutary craft; like cunning doctors, who often anoint the edge\r\nof the cup with a sweet cordial, when they wish to give some\r\nbitter-tasting medicine to sick and over-delicate children.\r\n\r\n“If, therefore, the Courtier put the veil of pleasure to such a use, he\r\nwill reach his aim in every time and place and exercise, and will\r\ndeserve much greater praise and reward than for any other good work that\r\nhe could do in the world. For there is no good thing that is of such\r\nuniversal advantage as a good prince, nor any evil so universally\r\nnoxious as a bad prince: hence, too, there is no punishment so harsh and\r\ncruel as to be a sufficient penalty for those wicked courtiers who use\r\ntheir gentle and pleasant ways and fine accomplishments to a bad end,\r\nand therewith seek their prince’s favour, in order to corrupt him and\r\nentice him from the path of virtue and lead him into vice; for such as\r\nthese may be said to taint with deadly poison not a single cup from\r\nwhich one man alone must drink, but the public fountain used by all\r\nmen.”\r\n\r\n11.—My lord Ottaviano was silent, as if he did not wish to say more; but\r\nmy lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“It does not seem to me, my lord Ottaviano, that this right-mindedness\r\nand continence, and the other virtues which you wish the Courtier to\r\nshow his lord, can be learned; but I think that the men who have them\r\nare given them by nature and by God. And that this is true, you see that\r\nthere is no man in the world so wicked and ill conditioned, or so\r\nintemperate and perverse, as to confess that he is so when he is asked;\r\nnay, everyone, however wicked he be, has pleasure in being deemed just,\r\ncontinent and good: which would not be the case if these virtues could\r\nbe learned; for it is no disgrace not to know that to which one has\r\ngiven no study, but it seems a reproach indeed not to have that\r\nwherewith we ought to be adorned by nature. Hence everyone tries to hide\r\nhis natural defects both of mind and of body too; which is seen in the\r\nblind, the halt and the crooked, and in others who are maimed or ugly;\r\nfor although these imperfections may be ascribed to nature, still\r\neveryone dislikes to be sensible of them in himself, because he seems by\r\nnature’s own testimony to have that defect as it were for a seal and\r\ntoken of his wickedness.\r\n\r\n“Moreover my opinion is confirmed by that story which is told of\r\nEpimetheus, who knew so ill how to distribute the gifts of nature among\r\nmen that he left them much poorer in everything than all other\r\ncreatures: wherefore Prometheus stole from Minerva and from Vulcan that\r\nartful cunning whereby men find the means of living;[437] but still they\r\ndid not have the civic cunning to gather together in cities and live\r\norderly lives, for this was guarded in Jove’s castle by very watchful\r\nwarders, who so frightened Prometheus that he dared not approach them;\r\nwherefore Jove had compassion for the misery of men, who were torn by\r\nwild beasts because they could not stand together for lack of civic\r\nfaculty, and sent Mercury to earth to bring them justice and shame, to\r\nthe end that these two things might adorn their cities and unite the\r\ncitizens. And he saw fit that they should not be given to men like the\r\nother arts, wherein one expert suffices for many ignorant (as in the\r\ncase of medicine), but that they should be impressed upon each man; and\r\nhe ordained a law that all who were without justice and shame should be\r\nexterminated and put to death like public pests. So you see, my lord\r\nOttaviano, that these virtues are vouchsafed by God to men, and are not\r\nacquired, but natural.”\r\n\r\n12.—Then my lord Ottaviano said, smiling:\r\n\r\n“Do you then insist, my lord Gaspar, that men are so unhappy and\r\nperverse, that they have by industry discovered an art to tame the\r\nnatures of wild beasts, bears, wolves, lions, and by it are able to\r\nteach a pretty bird to fly whither they like, and to return willingly\r\nfrom its woods and natural freedom to cages and captivity,—and yet that\r\nthey cannot or will not by the same industry find arts to help\r\nthemselves and improve their minds with diligence and study? To my\r\nthinking this would be as if physicians were to study with all diligence\r\nto acquire the mere art of healing sore nails and scurf in children, and\r\nwere to leave off curing fevers, pleurisy and other serious maladies;\r\nand how out of all reason this would be, everyone can consider.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I think that the moral virtues are not in us by nature\r\nwholly, for nothing can ever become used to that which is naturally\r\ncontrary to it; as we see in the case of a stone, which although it were\r\nthrown upwards ten thousand times would never become used to move\r\nthither of itself; hence if virtue were as natural to us as weight is to\r\nthe stone, we should never become used to vice. Nor, on the other hand,\r\nare the vices natural in this sense, for we should never be able to be\r\nvirtuous; and it would be too unfair and foolish to chastise men for\r\nthose defects that proceed from nature without our fault; and this\r\nerrour would be committed by the law, which does not inflict punishment\r\nupon malefactors on account of their past errour (since what is done can\r\nnot be undone), but has regard to the future, to the end that he who has\r\nerred may err no more nor be the cause of others erring through his bad\r\nexample. And thus the law presumes that the virtues can be learned,\r\nwhich is very true; for we are born capable of receiving them and the\r\nvices also, and hence custom creates in us the habit of both the one and\r\nthe other, so that we first practise virtue or vice, and then are\r\nvirtuous or vicious.\r\n\r\n“The contrary is observed in things that are bestowed by nature, which\r\nwe first have the power to practise and then do practise: as is the case\r\nwith the senses; for first we are able to see, hear and touch, then we\r\nsee, hear and touch, although also many of these functions are perfected\r\nby training. Wherefore good masters teach children not only letters, but\r\nalso good and seemly manners in eating, drinking, speaking and walking,\r\nwith certain appropriate gestures.\r\n\r\n13.—“Therefore as in the other arts, so too in virtue it is necessary to\r\nhave a master, who by instruction and good reminders shall arouse and\r\nawake in us those moral virtues whereof we have the seed enclosed and\r\nburied in our soul, and like a good husbandman shall cultivate them and\r\nopen the way for them by freeing us from the thorns and tares of\r\nappetite, which often so overshadow and choke our minds as not to let\r\nthem blossom or bring forth those happy fruits which alone we should\r\ndesire to have spring up in the human heart.\r\n\r\n“In this sense, then, justice and shame, which you say Jove sent upon\r\nearth to all men, are natural in each one of us. But just as a body\r\nwithout eyes, however strong it be, often fails if it moves towards any\r\nobject, so the root of these virtues potentially engendered in our minds\r\noften comes to naught if it be not helped by cultivation. For if it is\r\nto ripen into action and perfect character, nature alone is not enough,\r\nas has been said, but there is need of studied practice and of reason,\r\nto purify and clear the soul by lifting the dark veil of ignorance, from\r\nwhich nearly all the errours of men proceed,—because if good and evil\r\nwere well perceived and understood, everyone would always prefer good\r\nand shun evil. Thus virtue may almost be said to be a kind of prudence\r\nand wit to prefer the good, and vice a kind of imprudence and ignorance\r\nwhich lead us to judge falsely; for men never prefer evil deeming it to\r\nbe evil, but are deceived by a certain likeness that it bears to good.”\r\n\r\n14.—Then my lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“There are, however, many who know well that they are doing evil, and\r\nyet do it; and this because they have more thought for the present\r\npleasure which they feel, than for the chastisement which they fear must\r\ncome upon them: like thieves, homicides, and other such men.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano said:\r\n\r\n“True pleasure is always good, and true suffering always evil; therefore\r\nthese men deceive themselves in taking false pleasure for true, and true\r\nsuffering for false; hence by false pleasures they often run into true\r\nsufferings. Therefore that art which teaches how to discern the true\r\nfrom the false, may well be learned; and the faculty whereby we choose\r\nthat which is truly good and not that which falsely seems so, may be\r\ncalled true wisdom and more profitable to human life than any other,\r\nbecause it dispels the ignorance from which, as I have said, all evils\r\nspring.”\r\n\r\n15.—Then messer Pietro Bembo said:\r\n\r\n“I do not know, my lord Ottaviano, whether my lord Gaspar ought to grant\r\nyou that all evils spring from ignorance; and that there are not many\r\nwho well know that they are sinning when they sin, and do not in the\r\nleast deceive themselves as to true pleasure, nor yet as to true\r\nsuffering. For it is certain that those who are incontinent judge\r\nreasonably and rightly, and know that to be evil to which they are\r\nprompted by their lusts in spite of duty, and therefore resist and set\r\nreason against appetite, whence arises a conflict of pleasure and pain\r\nagainst judgment. Conquered at last by too potent appetite, reason\r\nyields, like a ship which resists awhile the buffetings of the sea, but\r\nfinally beaten by the too furious violence of the gale, with anchor and\r\nrigging broken, suffers herself to be driven at fortune’s will, without\r\nuse of helm or any guidance of compass to save her.\r\n\r\n“Therefore the incontinent commit their errours with a certain doubtful\r\nremorse, and as it were in their own despite; which they would not do if\r\nthey did not know that what they are doing is evil, but would follow\r\nappetite without restraint of reason and wholly uncontrolled, and would\r\nthen be not incontinent but intemperate, which is much worse. Thus\r\nincontinence is said to be a diminished vice, because it has a grain of\r\nreason in it; and likewise continence is said to be an imperfect virtue,\r\nbecause it has a grain of passion in it. Therefore in this, methinks, we\r\ncannot say that the errours of the incontinent proceed from ignorance,\r\nor that they deceive themselves and that they do not sin, when they well\r\nknow that they are sinning.”\r\n\r\n16.—My lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“In truth, messer Pietro, your argument is fine; yet to my thinking it\r\nis specious rather than sound, for although the incontinent sin\r\nhesitatingly, and reason struggles with appetite in their mind, and\r\nalthough that which is evil seems evil to them,—yet they have no perfect\r\nperception of it, nor do they know it so thoroughly as they need. Hence\r\nthey have a vague idea rather than any certain knowledge of it, and thus\r\nallow their reason to be overcome by passion; but if they had true\r\nknowledge of it, doubtless they would not err: since the thing by which\r\nappetite conquers reason is always ignorance, and true knowledge can\r\nnever be overcome by passion, which is derived from the body and not\r\nfrom the mind, and becomes virtue if rightly ruled and governed by\r\nreason; if not, it becomes vice.\r\n\r\n“But reason has such power that it always reduces the senses to\r\nsubmission and enters in by wonderful means and ways, provided ignorance\r\ndoes not seize that which it ought to possess. So that although the\r\nspirits and nerves and bones have no reason in them, yet when a movement\r\nof the mind starts in us, as if thought were spurring and shaking the\r\nbridle on our spirits, all our members make ready,—the feet to run, the\r\nhands to take or to do that which the mind thinks; and moreover this is\r\nclearly seen in many who at times unwittingly eat some loathsome and\r\ndisgusting food, which to their taste seems very delicious, and then\r\nlearning what thing it was, not only suffer pain and distress of mind,\r\nbut the body so follows the mental sense, that they must perforce cast\r\nup that food.”\r\n\r\n17.—My lord Ottaviano was continuing his discourse further, but the\r\nMagnifico Giuliano interrupted him and said:\r\n\r\n“If I heard aright, my lord Ottaviano, you said that continence is an\r\nimperfect virtue because it has a grain of passion in it; and when there\r\nis a struggle waging in our minds between reason and appetite, I think\r\nthat the virtue which battles and gives reason the victory, ought to be\r\nesteemed more perfect than that which conquers without opposition of\r\nlust or passion; for there the mind seems not to abstain from evil by\r\nforce of virtue, but to refrain from doing evil because it has no\r\ninclination thereto.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Ottaviano said:\r\n\r\n“Which captain would you deem of greater worth, the one who fighting\r\nopenly puts himself in danger and yet conquers the enemy, or the one who\r\nby his ability and skill deprives them of their strength, reducing them\r\nto such straits that they cannot fight, and thus conquers them without\r\nany battle or danger whatever?”\r\n\r\n“The one,” said the Magnifico Giuliano, “who more safely conquers is\r\nwithout doubt more to be praised, provided this safe victory of his do\r\nnot proceed from the cowardice of the enemy.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“You have judged rightly; and hence I tell you that continence may be\r\nlikened to a captain who fights manfully, and although the enemy be\r\nstrong and powerful, still conquers them, albeit not without great\r\ndifficulty and danger. While temperance unperturbed is like that captain\r\nwho conquers and rules without opposition, and having not only abated\r\nbut quite extinguished the fire of lust in the mind where she abides,\r\nlike a good prince in time of civil strife, she destroys her seditious\r\nenemies within, and gives reason the sceptre and whole dominion.\r\n\r\n“Thus this virtue does not compel the mind, but infusing it by very\r\ngentle means with a vehement belief that inclines it to righteousness,\r\nrenders it calm and full of rest, in all things equal and well measured,\r\nand disposed on every side by a certain self-accord which adorns it with\r\na tranquillity so serene that it is never ruffled, and becomes in all\r\nthings very obedient to reason and ready to turn its every act thereto\r\nand to follow wherever reason may wish to lead it, without the least\r\nunwillingness; like a tender lambkin, which always runs and stops and\r\nwalks near its dam, and moves only with her.\r\n\r\n“This virtue, then, is very perfect and especially befitting to princes,\r\nbecause from it spring many others.”\r\n\r\n18.—Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“I do not know what virtues befitting to a lord can spring from this\r\ntemperance, if it is the one which removes the passions from the mind,\r\nas you say. Perhaps this would be fitting in a monk or hermit; but I am\r\nby no means sure whether it would befit a prince (who was magnanimous,\r\nliberal and valiant in arms) never to feel, whatever might be done to\r\nhim, either wrath or hate or good will or scorn or lust or passion of\r\nany kind, and whether he could without this wield authority over\r\ncitizens or soldiers.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“I did not say that temperance wholly removes and uproots the passions\r\nfrom the human mind, nor would it be well to do this, for even the\r\npassions contain some elements of good; but it reduces to the sway of\r\nreason that which is perverse in our passions and recusant to right.\r\nTherefore it is not well to extirpate the passions altogether, in order\r\nto be rid of disturbance; for this would be like making an edict that no\r\none must drink wine, in order to be rid of drunkenness, or forbidding\r\neveryone to run, because in running we sometimes fall. You know that\r\nthose who tame horses do not keep them from running and leaping, but\r\nwould have them do so seasonably and in obedience to the rider.\r\n\r\n“Thus, when moderated by temperance, the passions are helpful to virtue,\r\nlike the wrath that aids strength, hatred of evil-doers aids justice,\r\nand likewise the other virtues are aided by the passions; which, if they\r\nwere wholly removed, would leave the reason very weak and languid, so\r\nthat it could effect little, like the master of a vessel abandoned by\r\nthe winds in a great calm.\r\n\r\n“Now do not marvel, messer Cesare, if I have said that many other\r\nvirtues are born of temperance, for when a mind is attuned to this\r\nharmony, it then through the reason easily receives true strength, which\r\nmakes it bold, and safe from every peril, and almost superior to human\r\npassions. Nor is this less true of justice (unspotted virgin, friend of\r\nmodesty and good, queen of all the other virtues), because she teaches\r\nus to do that which it is right to do, and to shun that which it is\r\nright to shun; and therefore she is most perfect, because the other\r\nvirtues perform their works through her, and because she is helpful to\r\nwhomsoever possesses her, both to himself and to others: without whom\r\n(as it is said) Jove himself could not rule his kingdom rightly.\r\nMagnanimity also follows these and enhances them all; but she cannot\r\nstand alone, for whoever has no other virtue, cannot be magnanimous.\r\nThen the guide of these virtues is foresight, which consists in a\r\ncertain judgment in choosing well. And in this happy chain are joined\r\nliberality, magnificence, thirst for honour, gentleness, pleasantness,\r\naffability and many others which there is not now time to name.\r\n\r\n“But if our Courtier will do that which we have said, he will find them\r\nall in his prince’s mind, and will daily see spring therefrom beautiful\r\nflowers and fruits, such as all the delightful gardens in the world do\r\nnot contain; and he will feel within him very great content when he\r\nremembers that he gave his prince, not that which fools give (which is\r\ngold or silver, vases, raiment, and the like, whereof the giver has very\r\ngreat dearth, and the recipient very great abundance), but that faculty\r\nwhich of all things human is perhaps the greatest and rarest—that is,\r\nthe manner and mode of ruling and reigning rightly: which would of\r\nitself alone suffice to make men happy and to bring back once more to\r\nearth that age of gold which is said to have been when Saturn reigned.”\r\n\r\n19.—My lord Ottaviano having here made a little pause as if to rest, my\r\nlord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Which do you think, my lord Ottaviano, the happier rule, and the more\r\nable to bring back to earth that age of gold which you have\r\nmentioned,—the rule of so good a prince, or the government of a good\r\nrepublic?”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“I should always prefer the rule of a good prince, because such dominion\r\nis more accordant with nature, and (if it is allowed to compare small\r\nthings with infinitely great) more like that of God, who governs the\r\nuniverse singly and alone.\r\n\r\n“But leaving this aside, you see that in those things that are wrought\r\nby human skill,—such as armies, great fleets, buildings and the\r\nlike,—the whole is referred to one man who governs to his liking. So too\r\nin our body all the members labour and are employed at the command of\r\nthe heart. Moreover it seems fitting that the people should be ruled by\r\none prince, as is the case also with many animals, to whom nature\r\nteaches this obedience as a very salutary thing. You know that stags,\r\ncranes and many other birds, when on their flight, always set up a\r\nleader, whom they follow and obey; and the bees obey their king as it\r\nwere by process of reason, and with as much reverence as the most\r\nobedient people on earth; and hence all this is very strong proof that\r\nthe dominion of princes is more accordant with nature than that of\r\nrepublics.”\r\n\r\n20.—Then messer Pietro Bembo said:\r\n\r\n“Yet it seems to me that since liberty has been given us by God as a\r\nsupreme gift, it is not reasonable that we should be deprived of it, nor\r\nthat one man should have a larger share of it than another: which\r\nhappens under the dominion of princes, who for the most part hold their\r\nsubjects in closest bondage. But in rightly ordered republics this\r\nliberty is fully preserved: besides which, both in judgments and in\r\ncouncils, it more often happens that one man’s opinion singly is wrong,\r\nthan that of many; because disturbance arising from anger or scorn or\r\nlust more easily enters the mind of one man than that of the many, who\r\nare almost like a great body of water, which is less liable to\r\ncorruption than a small one.\r\n\r\n“I say, too, that the example of the animals does not seem to me\r\napposite; for stags, cranes and the rest do not always set up the same\r\none to follow and obey, but on the contrary change and vary, giving the\r\ndominion over them now to one, now to another, and thus come to be a\r\nkind of republic rather than a monarchy; and this may be called true and\r\nequal liberty, when those who command to-day in turn obey to-morrow.\r\nNeither does the example of the bees seem to me pertinent, for that king\r\nof theirs is not of their own species; and therefore whoever would give\r\nmen a truly worthy lord, would need to find one of another species and\r\nof more excellent nature than that of men, if men must of reason obey\r\nhim, like the herds which obey not an animal of their own kind but a\r\nherdsman, who is a man and of higher species than theirs.\r\n\r\n“For these reasons, my lord Ottaviano, I think the rule of a republic is\r\nmore desirable than that of a king.”\r\n\r\n21.—Then my lord Ottaviano said:\r\n\r\n“Against your opinion, messer Pietro, I wish to cite only one argument;\r\nwhich is, that of the modes of ruling people well, three kinds only are\r\nto be found: one is monarchy; another, the rule of the good, whom the\r\nancients called optimates; the other, popular government. And the excess\r\nand opposite extreme, so to speak, wherein each one of the forms of rule\r\nfalls to ruin and decay, is when monarchy becomes tyranny; and when the\r\nrule of the optimates changes to government by a few powerful and bad\r\nmen; and when popular government is seized by the rabble, which breaks\r\ndown distinctions and commits the government of the whole to the caprice\r\nof the multitude. Of these three kinds of bad government, it is certain\r\nthat tyranny is the worst of all, as could be proved by many arguments;\r\nthen it follows that monarchy is the best of the three kinds of good\r\ngovernment, because it is the opposite of the worst; for, as you know,\r\nthe results of opposite causes are themselves opposite.\r\n\r\n“Now as to what you said about liberty, I reply that we ought not to say\r\nthat true liberty is to live as we like, but to live according to good\r\nlaws. Nor is it less natural and useful and necessary to obey than it is\r\nto command; and some things are born and thus appointed and ordained by\r\nnature to command, as certain others are to obey. True it is that there\r\nare two modes of ruling: the one imperious and violent, like that of\r\nmasters towards their slaves, and in this way the soul commands the\r\nbody; the other more mild and gentle, like that of good princes by means\r\nof laws over their subjects, and in this way the reason commands the\r\nappetite: and both of these modes are useful, for the body is by nature\r\ncreated apt for obedience to the soul, and so is appetite for obedience\r\nto reason. Moreover there are many men whose actions have to do only\r\nwith the use of the body; and such as these are as far from virtuous as\r\nthe soul from the body, and although they are rational creatures, they\r\nhave only such share of reason as to recognize it but not to possess or\r\nprofit by it. These, therefore, are naturally slaves, and it is better\r\nand more profitable for them to obey than to command.”\r\n\r\n22.—Thereupon my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“In what mode then are the discreet and virtuous, and those who are not\r\nby nature slaves, to be ruled?”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“With that gentle rule, kingly and civic. And to such men it is well\r\nsometimes to give the charge of those offices for which they are fitted,\r\nto the end that they too may be able to command and govern those less\r\nwise than themselves, but in such manner that the chief rule shall\r\nwholly depend upon the supreme prince. And since you said that it is an\r\neasier thing for the mind of one man to be corrupted than for that of\r\nmany, I say that it is also an easier thing to find one good and wise\r\nman than many. And to be good and wise ought to be deemed possible for a\r\nking of noble race, inclined to worthiness by his natural instinct and\r\nby the illustrious memory of his predecessors, and practised in good\r\nbehaviour; and if he be not of another species more than human (as you\r\nsaid of the bee-king), being aided by the teachings and by the education\r\nand skill of so prudent and excellent a Courtier as these gentlemen have\r\ndescribed,—he will be very just, continent, temperate, strong and wise,\r\nfull of liberality, magnificence, religion and clemency. In short, he\r\nwill be very glorious, and very dear to men and to God (by whose grace\r\nhe will attain that heroic worth which will make him exceed the limits\r\nof humanity), and may be called a demigod rather than a mortal man.\r\n\r\n“For God delights in and protects, not those princes who wish to imitate\r\nHim by displaying great power and making themselves adored of men, but\r\nthose who, besides the power that makes them mighty, strive to make\r\nthemselves like Him in goodness and wisdom, whereby they wish and are\r\nable to do good and to be His ministers, distributing for men’s weal the\r\nbenefits and gifts which they receive from Him. Thus, just as in heaven\r\nthe sun and moon and other stars show the world as in a mirrour some\r\nlikeness of God, so on earth a much liker image of God is found in those\r\ngood princes who love and revere Him, and show their people the shining\r\nlight of His justice and a reflection of His divine reason and mind; and\r\nwith such as these God shares His righteousness, equity, justice and\r\ngoodness, and those other happy blessings which I know not how to name,\r\nbut which display to the world much clearer proof of divinity than the\r\nsun’s light, or the continual revolving of the heavens and the various\r\ncoursing of the stars.\r\n\r\n23.—“Accordingly men have been placed by God under the ward of princes,\r\nwho for this reason ought to take diligent care of them, in order to\r\nrender Him an account of them like good stewards to their lord, and\r\nought to love them, and regard as personal to themselves every good and\r\nevil thing that happens to them, and provide for their happiness above\r\nevery other thing. Therefore the prince ought not only to be good, but\r\nalso to make others good, like that square used by architects, which not\r\nonly is straight and true itself, but also makes straight and true all\r\nthings to which it is applied. And a very great proof that the prince is\r\ngood is when his people are good, because the prince’s life is law and\r\npreceptress to his subjects, and upon his behaviour all the others must\r\nneeds depend; nor is it fitting for an ignorant man to teach, nor for an\r\nunordered man to give orders, nor for one who falls to raise up others.\r\n\r\n“Hence if the prince would perform these duties rightly, he must devote\r\nevery study and diligence to wisdom; then he must set before himself and\r\nfollow steadfastly in everything the law of reason (unwritten on paper\r\nor metal, but graven upon his own mind), to the end that it may be not\r\nonly familiar to him, but ingrained in him, and abide with him as a part\r\nof himself; so that day and night, in every place and time, it may\r\nadmonish him and speak inwardly to his heart, freeing him from those\r\ndisturbances that are felt by intemperate minds, which—because they are\r\noppressed on the one hand as it were by the very deep sleep of\r\nignorance, and on the other by the travail which they suffer from their\r\nperverse and blind desires—are tossed by relentless fury, as a sleeper\r\nsometimes is by strange and dreadful visions.\r\n\r\n24.—“Moreover, by adding greater power to evil wish, greater harm is\r\nadded also; and when the prince is able to do that which he wishes, then\r\nthere is great danger that he will not wish that which he ought. Hence\r\nBias well said that office shows what men are:[438] for just as vases\r\nwith some crack in them cannot easily be detected so long as they are\r\nempty, yet if liquid be poured in they at once show where the flaw\r\nis;—so corrupt and vicious minds seldom disclose their defects except\r\nwhen they are filled with authority; because then they do not suffice to\r\nbear the heavy weight of power, and hence run all lengths and scatter on\r\nevery side the greeds, the pride, the bad temper, the insolence, and\r\nthose tyrannical practices, which they have within them. Thus they\r\nrecklessly persecute the good and wise and exalt the wicked, and in\r\ntheir cities they permit neither friendships nor unions nor\r\nunderstandings among their subjects, but maintain spies, informers and\r\nmurderers, in order that they may frighten and make men cowardly, and\r\nsow discords to keep men disunited and weak. And from these ways there\r\nthen ensue countless ruin and losses to the unhappy people, and often\r\ncruel death (or at least continual fear) to the tyrants themselves;\r\nbecause good princes are not afraid for themselves, but for those whom\r\nthey rule, while tyrants fear even those whom they rule; hence the\r\ngreater the number of people they rule and the more powerful they are,\r\nso much the more do they fear and so many more enemies do they have.\r\n\r\n“How frightened and of what uneasy mind do you think was Clearchus,\r\ntyrant of Pontus,[439] every time he went into the market-place or\r\ntheatre, or to a banquet or other public place? who, as it is written,\r\nwas wont to sleep shut up in a chest. Or that other tyrant, Aristodemus\r\nthe Argive?[440] who made a kind of prison of his bed: for in his palace\r\nhe had a little room hung in air, and so high that it could be reached\r\nonly by a ladder; and here he slept with one of his women, whose mother\r\ntook away the ladder at night and replaced it in the morning.\r\n\r\n“A wholly different life from this, then, ought that of the good prince\r\nto be, free and safe and as dear to his subjects as their very own, and\r\nso ordered as to partake both of the active and of the contemplative, as\r\nmuch as may comport with his people’s weal.”\r\n\r\n25.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“And which of these two lives, my lord Ottaviano, seems to you more\r\nfitting for the prince?”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you think I imagine myself to be that excellent Courtier who\r\nought to know so many things and apply them to that good end which I\r\nhave set forth; but remember that these gentlemen have described him\r\nwith many accomplishments that are not in me. Therefore let us first\r\ntake care to find him, for I leave to him both this and all things else\r\nthat belong to a good prince.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I think that if any of the accomplishments ascribed to the Courtier are\r\nlacking in you, they are music and dancing and others of small\r\nimportance, rather than those that belong to the moulding of the prince\r\nand to this end of Courtiership.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“None of those are of small importance that help to win the prince’s\r\nfavour, which is necessary (as we have said) before the Courtier risks\r\ntrying to teach him virtue; which I think I have proved can be learned,\r\nand in which there is as much profit as there is loss in ignorance,\r\nwhence spring all sins, and especially that false esteem which men\r\ncherish of themselves. But methinks I have said enough, and perhaps more\r\nthan I promised.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“We shall be the more beholden to your courtesy, the more your\r\nperformance outstrips your promise; so do not weary of saying what\r\noccurs to you about my lord Gaspar’s question; and by your faith, tell\r\nus also everything that you would teach your prince if he had need of\r\ninstruction, and imagine yourself to have won completely his favour, so\r\nthat you are allowed to tell him freely what comes into your mind.”\r\n\r\n26.—My lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“If I had the favour of a certain prince whom I know, and were to tell\r\nhim freely what I think, I fear that I should soon lose it; moreover, to\r\nteach him, I myself should first need to learn.\r\n\r\n“Yet since it pleases you to have me answer my lord Gaspar further\r\nconcerning this, I say that I think princes ought to lead both the two\r\nlives, but more especially the contemplative life, because in their case\r\nthis is divided into two parts: one of which consists in perceiving\r\nrightly and in judging; the other in commanding (justly and in those\r\nways that are fitting) things reasonable and those wherein they have\r\nauthority, and in requiring the same of such men as have in reason to\r\nobey, and at appropriate times and places; and of this Duke Federico\r\nspoke when he said that whoever knows how to command is always obeyed.\r\nAnd as command is always the chief office of princes, they ought often\r\nto see with their own eyes and be present at the execution of their\r\ncommands, and ought also sometimes to take part themselves, according to\r\nthe time and need; and all this partakes of action: but the aim of the\r\nactive life ought to be the contemplative, as peace is that of war,\r\nrepose that of toil.\r\n\r\n27.—“Therefore it is also the good prince’s office so to establish his\r\npeople, and under such laws and ordinances, that they may live at ease\r\nand peace, without danger and with dignity, and may worthily enjoy this\r\nend of their actions, which ought to be tranquillity. For many republics\r\nand princes are often found that have been very prosperous and great in\r\nwar, and as soon as they have had peace they have gone to ruin and lost\r\ntheir greatness and splendour, like iron laid aside. And this has come\r\nabout from nothing else but from their not having been well established\r\nfor living at peace, and from their not knowing how to enjoy the\r\nblessing of ease. And to be always at war, without seeking to arrive at\r\nthe end of peace, is not permitted: albeit some princes think that their\r\nchief aim ought to be to lord it over their neighbours; and therefore\r\nthey train their people to a warlike ferocity for spoil, killing and the\r\nlike, and give rewards to excite it, and call it virtue.\r\n\r\n“Thus it was once a custom among the Scythians that whoever had not\r\nslain an enemy might not drink from the bowl which was handed about to\r\nthe company at solemn feasts. In other places they used to set up,\r\naround a tomb, as many obelisks as he who was buried there had slain\r\nenemies; and all these things were done to make men warlike, solely in\r\norder to lord it over others: which was almost impossible, because the\r\nundertaking was endless (until the whole world should be subjugated) and\r\nfar from reasonable according to the law of nature, which will not have\r\nus pleased with that in others which is displeasing to us in ourselves.\r\n\r\n“Therefore princes ought not to make their people warlike for lust of\r\nrule, but for the sake of being able to defend themselves and their\r\npeople against him who would reduce them to bondage or do them wrong in\r\nany wise; or to drive out tyrants and govern those people well who were\r\nill used, or to reduce to bondage those who are by nature such as to\r\ndeserve being made slaves, with the object of governing them well and\r\ngiving them ease and rest and peace. To this end also the laws and all\r\nthe ordinances of justice ought to be directed, by punishing the wicked,\r\nnot from hatred, but in order that they may not be wicked and to the end\r\nthat they may not disturb the tranquillity of the good. For in truth it\r\nis a monstrous thing and worthy of blame for men to show themselves\r\nvaliant and wise in war (which is bad in itself) and in peace and quiet\r\n(which are good) to show themselves ignorant and of so little worth that\r\nthey know not how to enjoy their happiness.\r\n\r\n“Hence, just as in war men ought to apply themselves to the qualities\r\nthat are useful and necessary to attain its end, which is peace,—so in\r\npeace, to attain its end also, which is tranquillity, they ought to\r\napply themselves to the righteous qualities that are the end of the\r\nuseful. And thus subjects will be good, and the prince will have much\r\nmore to praise and reward than to punish; and dominion will be very\r\nhappy for the subjects and for the prince—not imperious, like that of\r\nmaster over slave, but sweet and gentle, like that of a good father over\r\na good son.”\r\n\r\n28.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I should much like to know what these virtues are that are useful and\r\nnecessary in war, and what ones are righteous in peace.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“All virtues are good and helpful, because they tend to a good end; but\r\nof especial utility in war is that true courage which so frees the mind\r\nfrom the passions that it not only fears not dangers, but even pays no\r\nheed to them; likewise steadfastness, and that enduring patience, with a\r\nmind staunch and undisturbed by all the shocks of fortune. It is also\r\nfitting in war, and always, to have all the virtues that make for\r\nright,—like justice, continence, temperance; but much more in time of\r\npeace and ease, because men placed in prosperity and ease, when good\r\nfortune smiles upon them, often become unjust, intemperate, and allow\r\nthemselves to be corrupted by pleasures: hence those who are in such\r\ncase have very great need of these virtues, for ease too readily\r\nengenders evil behaviour in human minds. Therefore it was anciently said\r\nas a proverb, slaves should be given no ease; and it is believed that\r\nthe pyramids of Egypt were made to keep the people busy, because it is\r\nvery good for everyone to be accustomed to bear toil.\r\n\r\n“There are still many other virtues that are all helpful, but let it\r\nsuffice for the present that I have spoken until now; for if I knew how\r\nto teach my prince and instruct him in this kind of worthy education\r\nsuch as we have planned, merely by so doing I should deem myself to have\r\nattained sufficiently well the aim of the good Courtier.”\r\n\r\n29.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Ottaviano, since you have highly praised good education, and\r\nseemed almost to think that it is the chief means of making a man\r\nvirtuous and good, I should like to know whether this instruction, which\r\nthe Courtier must give his prince, ought to be begun with practice and\r\nwith daily behaviour as it were, so as to accustom him to right doing\r\nwithout his perceiving it; or whether a beginning ought to be made by\r\ndemonstrating to his reason the quality of good and evil, and by making\r\nhim understand, before he sets out, which is the good way and the one to\r\nfollow, and which is the bad way and the one to avoid: in short whether\r\nhis mind ought to be first imbued and implanted with the virtues through\r\nthe reason and intelligence or through practice.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano said:\r\n\r\n“You start me upon too long a discourse; still, in order that you may\r\nnot think I abstain from lack of will to answer your questions, I say\r\nthat just as our mind and body are two things, so too the soul is\r\ndivided into two parts, of which one has the reason in it, and the other\r\nhas the appetite. Then, just as in generation the body precedes the\r\nsoul, so the unreasoning part of the soul precedes the reasoning part:\r\nwhich is clearly perceived in children, in whom anger and lust are seen\r\nalmost as soon as they are born, but with the lapse of time reason\r\nappears. Hence care must be taken of the body earlier than of the soul,\r\nand of appetite earlier than of reason; but care of the body with a view\r\nto the soul, and of the appetite with a view to reason: for just as\r\nintellectual worth is perfected by instruction, so is moral worth\r\nperfected by practice. We ought, therefore, first to teach through\r\nhabit, which is able to govern the as yet unreasoning appetites and to\r\ndirect them towards the good by means of that fair use; next we ought to\r\nestablish them through the understanding, which, although it shows its\r\nlight more tardily, still furnishes a mode of making the virtues more\r\nperfectly fruitful to one whose mind is well trained by\r\npractice,—wherein, to my thinking, lies the whole matter.”\r\n\r\n30.—My lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“Before you go further, I should like to know what care ought to be\r\ntaken of the body, since you said that we ought to take care of it\r\nearlier than of the soul.”\r\n\r\n“As to that,” replied my lord Ottaviano, laughing, “ask those who\r\nnourish their bodies well, and are plump and fresh; for mine, as you\r\nsee, is not too well conditioned. Yet of this also it would be possible\r\nto say much, as of the proper time for marriage, to the end that the\r\nchildren may not be too near or too far from their father’s age; of the\r\nexercises and education to be followed from birth and during the rest of\r\nlife, in order to make them handsome, strong and sturdy.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“That which would best please women for making their children handsome\r\nand beautiful, methinks would be that community wherein Plato in his\r\nRepublic wishes them to be held, and after that manner.”[441]\r\n\r\nThen my lady Emilia said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“It is not in the compact that you should fall to speaking ill of women\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” replied my lord Gaspar, “that I give them great praise in\r\nsaying that they wish to bring in a custom approved by so great a man.”\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare Gonzaga said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Let us see whether this could have place among my lord Ottaviano’s\r\nprecepts (I do not know if he has rehearsed them all), and whether it\r\nwere well for the prince to make it law.”\r\n\r\n“The few that I have rehearsed,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “might\r\nperhaps suffice to make a prince good, as princes go nowadays; although\r\nif one cared to look into the matter more minutely, he would still have\r\nmuch more to say.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess added:\r\n\r\n“Since it costs us nothing but words, tell us on your faith everything\r\nthat it would occur to your mind to teach your prince.”\r\n\r\n31.—My lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“Many other things, my Lady, would I teach him, provided I knew them;\r\nand among others, that he should choose from his subjects a number of\r\nthe noblest and wisest gentlemen, with whom he should consult on\r\neverything, and that he should give them authority and free leave to\r\nspeak their mind to him about all things without ceremony; and that he\r\nshould preserve such demeanour towards them, that they all might\r\nperceive that he wished to know the truth about everything and held all\r\nmanner of falsehood in hatred. Besides this council of nobles, I should\r\nadvise that there be chosen from the people other men of lower rank, of\r\nwhom a popular council should be made, to communicate with the council\r\nof nobles concerning the affairs of the city, both public and private.\r\nAnd in this way there would be made of the prince (as of the head) and\r\nof the nobles and commonalty (as of the members) a single united body,\r\nthe government of which would spring chiefly from the prince and yet\r\ninclude the others also; and this state would thus have the form of the\r\nthree good kinds of government, which are Monarchy, Optimates, and\r\nPeople.[442]\r\n\r\n32.—“Next I should show him that of the cares which belong to the\r\nprince, the most important is that of justice; for the maintenance of\r\nwhich wise and well-tried men ought to be chosen to office, whose\r\nforesight is true foresight accompanied by goodness, for else it is not\r\nforesight, but cunning; and when this goodness is lacking, the pleaders’\r\nskill and subtlety always work nothing but ruin and destruction to law\r\nand justice, and the guilt of all their errours must be laid on him who\r\nput them in office.\r\n\r\n“I should tell how justice also fosters that piety towards God which is\r\nthe duty of all men, and especially of princes, who ought to love Him\r\nabove every other thing and direct all their actions to Him as to the\r\ntrue end; and as Xenophon said, to honour and love Him always, but much\r\nmore when they are in prosperity, so that afterwards they may the more\r\nreasonably have confidence to ask Him for mercy when they are in some\r\nadversity.[443] For it is impossible to govern rightly either one’s self\r\nor others without the help of God; who to the good sometimes sends good\r\nfortune as His minister to relieve them from grievous perils; sometimes\r\nadverse fortune, to prevent their being so lulled by prosperity as to\r\nforget Him or human foresight, which often repairs evil fortune, as a\r\ngood player repairs bad throws of the dice by placing his board\r\nwell.[444] Moreover I should not cease reminding the prince to be truly\r\nreligious—not superstitious or given to the vanities of incantation and\r\nsooth-saying; for by adding divine piety and true religion to human\r\nforesight, he would have good fortune too and a protecting God always to\r\nincrease his prosperity in peace and in war.\r\n\r\n33.—“Next I should tell how he ought to love his land and people, not\r\nholding them too much in bondage, lest he make himself odious to them,\r\nfrom which thing there arise seditions, conspiracies and a thousand\r\nother evils; nor yet in too great freedom, lest he be despised, from\r\nwhich proceed licentious and dissolute life among his people, rapine,\r\ntheft, murder, without any fear of the law; often the ruin and total\r\ndestruction of city and realms. Next, how he ought to love those near\r\nhim according to their degree, maintaining among all men an even\r\nequality in some things, as in justice and liberty; and in certain other\r\nthings a judicious inequality, as in being generous, in rewarding, in\r\ndistributing honours and dignities according to the inequality of their\r\nmerits, which always ought not to exceed but to be exceeded by their\r\nrewards; and that in this way he would be not merely loved but almost\r\nadored by his subjects. Nor would there be need that he should turn to\r\naliens for the safeguard of his life, because his own people for their\r\nvery profit would guard it with their own, and all men would gladly obey\r\nthe laws, when they found that he himself obeyed and was as it were the\r\nguardian and incorruptible minister of the same; and thus he would make\r\nso strong an impression in this matter, that even if he sometimes\r\nchanced to infringe the laws in some particular, everyone would feel\r\nthat it was done for a good end, and the same respect and reverence\r\nwould be paid to his wish as to the law itself.\r\n\r\n“Thus the minds of his subjects would be so tempered that the good would\r\nnot seek for more than they needed, and the bad could not; for excessive\r\nriches are oftentimes the cause of great ruin, as in poor Italy, which\r\nhas been and still is exposed as a prey to foreign nations, both because\r\nof bad government and because of the great riches of which it is full.\r\nHence it were well to have the greater part of the citizens neither very\r\nrich nor very poor, for the over-rich often become insolent and rash;\r\nthe poor, base and dishonest; but men of moderate fortune do not lay\r\nsnares for others, and live safe from being snared: and being the\r\ngreater number, these men of moderate fortune are also more powerful;\r\nand therefore neither the poor nor the rich can conspire against the\r\nprince or other men, nor can they sow seditions; wherefore, in order to\r\navoid this evil, it is a very wholesome thing to preserve a mean in all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n34.—“I should say then, that the prince ought to employ these and many\r\nother suitable precautions, so that there may not arise in his subjects’\r\nmind a desire for new things and for a change of government; which they\r\nmost often bring to pass either for gain or else for honour which they\r\nhope for, or because of loss or else of shame which they fear. And this\r\nunrest is engendered in their minds sometimes by hatred and anger\r\ndriving them to despair, by reason of the wrongs and insults that have\r\nbeen wrought upon them through the avarice, insolence and cruelty or\r\nlust of their superiors; sometimes by the contempt that is aroused in\r\nthem by the neglect and baseness and unworthiness of their princes.\r\nThese two errours ought to be avoided by winning the people’s love and\r\nobedience; as is done by benefiting and rewarding the good, and by\r\nprudently and sometimes severely precluding the bad and seditious from\r\nbecoming powerful, which is much easier to prevent before they have\r\nbecome so than to deprive them of power after they have once acquired\r\nit. And I should say that to prevent a subject from running into these\r\nerrours, there is no better way than to keep him from evil practices,\r\nand especially from those that spread little by little; for they are\r\nsecret pests that infect cities before it is possible to cure or even to\r\ndetect them.\r\n\r\n“By such means I should advise that the prince contrive to keep his\r\nsubjects in a tranquil state, and to give them the blessings of mind and\r\nbody and fortune; but those of the body and of fortune, in order to be\r\nable to exercise those of the mind, which are the more profitable the\r\ngreater and more superabundant they are; which is not true of those of\r\nthe body and of fortune. If, then, the subjects be good and worthy and\r\nrightly directed towards the goal of happiness, their prince is a very\r\ngreat lord; for that is a true and great dominion, under which the\r\nsubjects are good and well governed and well commanded.”\r\n\r\n35.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I think that he would be a small lord under whom all the subjects were\r\ngood, for in every place the good are few.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“If some Circe were to change all the subjects of the King of France\r\ninto wild beasts, would he not seem to you a small lord for all he ruled\r\nover so many thousand animals?[445] And on the other hand, if only the\r\nflocks that roam our mountains here for pasture were to become wise men\r\nand worthy cavaliers, would you not think that those herdsmen who\r\ngoverned them and were obeyed by them, had become great lords instead of\r\nherdsmen? You see then, that it is not the number but the worth of their\r\nsubjects that makes princes great.”\r\n\r\n36.—My lady Duchess and my lady Emilia and all the others had been for a\r\ngood space very attentive to my lord Ottaviano’s discourse; but since he\r\nnow made a little pause, as if he had finished his discourse, messer\r\nCesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“Verily, my lord Ottaviano, it cannot be said that your precepts are not\r\ngood and useful; nevertheless I should think that if you fashioned your\r\nprince after them, you would rather deserve the name of a good\r\nschool-master than of a good Courtier, and he rather that of a good\r\ngovernor than of a great prince. I am far from saying that the care of\r\nlords should not be to have their people well ruled with justice and\r\ngood uses; nevertheless methinks it is enough for them to select good\r\nministers to dispose of such matters, and that their true office is much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n“Therefore if I felt myself to be that excellent Courtier which these\r\ngentlemen have described, and to possess the favour of my prince, I\r\ncertainly should not lead him into anything vicious; but, to pursue that\r\ngood end which you tell of, and which I agree ought to be the fruit of\r\nthe Courtier’s toils and actions, I should seek to impress upon his mind\r\na certain greatness, together with that regal splendour and readiness of\r\nmind and unconquered valour in war which should make him loved and\r\nrevered by everyone to such a degree that he should be famous and\r\nillustrious in the world chiefly for this. I should tell him also that\r\nhe ought to accompany his greatness with a familiar gentleness, with\r\nthat sweet and amiable humanity, and a fine manner of caressing both his\r\nsubjects and strangers with discrimination, more or less according to\r\ntheir merits,—always preserving, however, the majesty suited to his\r\nrank, so as not to allow his authority to abate one jot from\r\nover-condescension, nor on the other hand to excite hatred by too stern\r\nseverity; that he ought to be very generous and splendid, and to give to\r\nall men without reserve, because God, as the saying runs, is the\r\ntreasurer of generous princes; that he ought to give magnificent\r\nbanquets, festivals, games, public shows; to have a great number of\r\nexcellent horses (for use in war and for pleasure in time of peace),\r\nfalcons, hounds, and all things else that pertain to the pleasures of\r\ngreat lords and of the people: as in our days we have seen done by my\r\nlord Francesco Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua, who in these matters seems\r\nrather King of Italy than lord of a city.[446]\r\n\r\n“I should seek also to induce him to erect great buildings, both to win\r\nhonour in his lifetime and to give a memorial of himself to posterity:\r\nas Duke Federico did in the case of this noble palace,[447] and as Pope\r\nJulius is now doing in the case of St. Peter’s Church[448] and of that\r\nstreet which leads from the Palace to his pleasure pavilion the\r\nBelvedere,[449] and many other buildings: as also the ancient Romans\r\ndid, whereof we see so many remains at Rome and at Naples, at Pozzuoli,\r\nat Baja, at Civita Vecchia, at Porto,[450] and out of Italy too, and\r\nmany other places,—which are great proof of the worth of those divine\r\nminds.[451] So did Alexander the Great also, for not content with the\r\nfame that he had justly won by having conquered the world with arms, he\r\nbuilt Alexandria in Egypt, Bucephalia in India,[452] and other cities in\r\nother countries; and he thought of reducing Mount Athos to the form of a\r\nman, and of building a very spacious city in its left hand, and in its\r\nright a great basin in which were to be gathered all the rivers that\r\ntake their rise there, and from it they were to flow over into the\r\nsea:[453] a truly great thought and one worthy of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n“These, my lord Ottaviano, are things which I think befit a noble and\r\ntrue prince, and make him very glorious in peace and war; and not\r\nsetting his mind to so many trifles, and taking care to fight solely in\r\norder to rule or conquer those who deserve to be ruled, or for his\r\nsubjects’ profit, or to deprive those of power who wield it ill. For if\r\nthe Romans, Alexander, Hannibal and the others had had these aims, they\r\nwould not have reached that height of glory to which they did attain.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  POPE JULIUS II\r\n  GIULIANO DELLA ROVERE\r\n  1443-1513\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from a part of Braun’s photograph (no. 42.079) of the portrait,\r\n    in the Pitti Gallery at Florence, by Raphael (1483-1520). Of two\r\n    similar portraits, one is in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence, and the\r\n    other is in the National Gallery at London. Both Passavant and\r\n    Morelli affirmed the superior authenticity of the picture here\r\n    presented, which is believed to have been painted for the Duke of\r\n    Urbino.\r\n\r\n37.—Then my lord Ottaviano replied, laughing:\r\n\r\n“Those who had not these aims, would have done better if they had;\r\nalthough if you think, you will find many that did, and particularly\r\nthose first ancients, like Theseus and Hercules. And do not imagine that\r\nProcrustes and Sciron, Cacus, Diomed, Antæus, Geryon, were other than\r\ncruel and impious tyrants, against whom these lofty-minded heroes waged\r\nperpetual and deadly war.[454] Therefore, for having delivered the world\r\nfrom such intolerable monsters (for only thus ought tyrants to be\r\ncalled), temples were raised and sacrifices offered to Hercules, and\r\ndivine honours paid to him; since the extirpation of tyrants is a\r\nbenefit so profitable to the world that he who confers it deserves much\r\ngreater reward than any befitting to a mortal.[455]\r\n\r\n“And of those whom you named, do you not think that by his victories\r\nAlexander did good to the peoples whom he conquered, having taught so\r\nmany good customs to those barbarous tribes which he overcame, that out\r\nof wild beasts he made them men? He built so many fine cities in lands\r\nthat were ill-inhabited, and introduced right living there, and as it\r\nwere united Asia and Europe by the bond of friendship and holy laws,\r\nthat those who were conquered by him were happier than the others. For\r\nto some he taught marriage, to others agriculture, to others religion,\r\nothers he taught not to kill but to support their fathers when grown\r\nold, others to abstain from union with their mothers, and a thousand\r\nother things that could be told in proof of the benefit which his\r\nvictories conferred upon the world.\r\n\r\n38.—“But leaving the ancients aside, what more noble and glorious\r\nenterprise and more profitable could there be than for Christians to\r\ndevote their power to subjugating the infidels?[456] Do you not think\r\nthat this war, if it succeeded prosperously and were the means of\r\nturning so many thousand men from the false sect of Mahomet to the light\r\nof Christian truth, would be as profitable to the vanquished as to the\r\nvictors? And truly, as Themistocles once said to his family, being\r\nbanished from his native land and received by the King of Persia and\r\ncaressed and honoured with countless and very rich gifts: ‘My friends,\r\nwe should have been undone but for our undoing;’[457] so with reason\r\nmight the Turks and Moors then say the same, because in their loss would\r\nlie their salvation.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I hope that we shall yet see this happiness, if God grant\r\nlife enough for Monseigneur d’Angoulême to attain the crown of\r\nFrance,[458] who gives such promise of himself as my lord Magnifico told\r\nof four evenings since; and for my lord Henry, Prince of Wales,[459] to\r\nattain that of England, who now is growing up under his great father in\r\nevery sort of virtue,[460] like a tender shoot under the shade of an\r\nexcellent and fruit-laden tree, to renew it with much greater beauty and\r\nfruitfulness when the time shall be; for as our friend Castiglione\r\nwrites thence,[461] and promises to tell more fully on his return, it\r\nseems that nature wished in this lord to show her power by gathering in\r\na single body enough excellences to adorn a host.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Bernardo Bibbiena said:\r\n\r\n“Very great promise is shown also by Don Carlos, Prince of Spain, who\r\n(although not yet arrived at the tenth year of his age) already shows so\r\nmuch capacity and such certain signs of goodness, of foresight, of\r\nmodesty, of magnanimity and of every virtue, that if the empire of\r\nChristendom shall be (as men think) in his hands, we may believe that he\r\nmust eclipse the name of many ancient emperors, and equal the fame of\r\nthe most famous that have been on earth.”[462]\r\n\r\n39.—My lord Ottaviano added:\r\n\r\n“I think, then, that such divine princes as these have been sent by God\r\non earth, and by Him made to resemble one another in youth, in martial\r\npower, in state, in beauty and bodily shape, to the end that they may be\r\nof one accord for this good purpose also. And if there must ever be any\r\nenvy or emulation among them, it may be solely in wishing to be each the\r\nfirst and most fervent and zealous for so glorious an enterprise.\r\n\r\n“But let us leave this discourse and return to our subject. I say, then,\r\nmesser Cesare, that the things which you wish the prince to do are very\r\ngreat and worthy of much praise; but you ought to understand that if he\r\ndoes not know that which I have said he ought to know, and has not\r\nformed his mind after that pattern and directed it to the path of\r\nvirtue, he will hardly know how to be magnanimous, generous, just,\r\ncourageous, foreseeing, or to possess any of those other qualities that\r\nare looked for in him. Nor yet would I have him such merely for the sake\r\nof being able to exercise these qualities: for just as those who build\r\nare not all good architects, so those who give are not all generous;\r\nbecause virtue never harms any man, and there are many who rob in order\r\nto give away, and thus are generous with the property of others; some\r\ngive to those they ought not, and leave in misfortune and distress those\r\nto whom they are beholden; others give with a certain bad grace and\r\nalmost spite, so that men see they do so on compulsion; others not only\r\nmake no secret of it, but call witnesses and almost proclaim their\r\ngenerosities; others foolishly empty the fountain of their generosity at\r\na draught, so that it can be no more used again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PRINCE HENRY OF WALES\r\n  AFTERWARDS HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND\r\n  1491-1547\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Walker and Boutall’s photograph of an anonymous portrait\r\n    (no. 157) in the National Portrait Gallery at London. Painted on\r\n    copper, and formerly owned by Mr. Barrett at Lee Priory, Kent, the\r\n    picture was acquired by the Gallery from the Messrs. Graves in 1863.\r\n\r\n40.—“Hence in this, as in other things, it is needful to know and to\r\ngovern one’s self with that foresight which is the necessary companion\r\nof all the virtues; which being midway are near the two extremes—that\r\nis, the vices; and thus he who does not know, easily runs into them. For\r\njust as it is difficult to find the central point in a circle, which is\r\nthe mean, so is it difficult to find the point of virtue set midway\r\nbetween the two extremes (vicious, the one because of excess, the other\r\nbecause of deficiency); and to these we are inclined, sometimes to one\r\nand sometimes to the other. We perceive this in the pleasure or\r\ndispleasure that we feel within us, for by reason of the one we do that\r\nwhich we ought not, and by reason of the other we fail to do that which\r\nwe ought; but the pleasure is much the more dangerous, because our\r\njudgment allows itself to be easily corrupted by it.\r\n\r\n“But since it is a difficult thing to perceive how far a man is from the\r\ncentral point of virtue, we ought of our own accord to withdraw step by\r\nstep in the direction opposite to the extreme towards which we perceive\r\nourselves to be inclined, as those do who straighten crooked timbers;\r\nfor in such wise we approximate to virtue, which (as I have said)\r\nconsists in that central point. Hence it happens that we err in many\r\nways and perform our office and duty in only one way, just like archers,\r\nwho hit the mark by one way only and miss the target by many. Thus, in\r\nhis wish to be humane and affable, one prince often does countless\r\nthings beneath his dignity, and so abases himself that he is despised;\r\nanother, to preserve his grave majesty with becoming authority, becomes\r\naustere and intolerable; another, to be held eloquent, strays into a\r\nthousand strange fashions and long mazes of affected words, listening to\r\nhimself to such a degree that others cannot listen to him for weariness.\r\n\r\n41.—“Therefore do not call anything a trifle, messer Cesare, that can\r\nimprove a prince in any particular, however slight it be; nor must you\r\nsuppose that I think you disparage my precepts when you say that by them\r\na good governor would be fashioned rather than a good prince; for\r\nperhaps no greater or more fitting praise can be given to a prince than\r\nto call him a good governor. Hence if it lay with me to instruct him, I\r\nwould have him take care to heed not only the matters already mentioned,\r\nbut those which are much smaller, and as far as possible understand all\r\ndetails affecting his people, nor ever so believe or trust any one of\r\nhis ministers as to confide to that one alone the bridle and control of\r\nall his government. For there is no man who is very apt for all things,\r\nand much greater harm arises from the credulity of lords than from their\r\nincredulity, which not only sometimes does no harm, but often is of the\r\ngreatest advantage: albeit in this matter there is need of good judgment\r\nin the prince, to perceive who deserves to be believed and who does not.\r\n\r\n“I would have him take care to understand the acts and be the overseer\r\nof his ministers; to settle and shorten disputes among his subjects; to\r\nbe the means of making peace among them, and of allying them in\r\nmarriage; to have his city all united and agreed in friendship like a\r\nprivate family, populous, not poor, peaceful, full of good artificers;\r\nto favour merchants and even to aid them with money; to be generous and\r\nsplendid in hospitality towards foreigners and ecclesiastics; to\r\nmoderate all superfluities, for through the errours that are committed\r\nin these matters, small though they seem, cities often come to ruin.\r\nWherefore it is reasonable that the prince should set a limit upon the\r\ntoo sumptuous houses of private folk, upon feasts, upon the excessive\r\ndoweries of women, upon their luxury, upon their display in jewels and\r\nvesture, which is naught but a proof of their folly; for besides often\r\nwasting their husbands’ goods and substance through the ambition and the\r\nenvy which they bear one another, they sometimes sell their honour to\r\nanyone who will buy it, for the sake of a trinket or some other like\r\ntrifle.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEDERICO GONZAGA\r\n  MARQUESS AND AFTERWARDS DUKE OF MANTUA\r\n  1500-1540\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a cast, kindly furnished by M.

For without doubt it would be easier to\r\nfind a lady with the qualities mentioned by my lord Magnifico, than a\r\nprince with the qualities mentioned by you; hence I fear that he is like\r\nPlato’s Republic, and that we are never to see his equal, unless perhaps\r\nin Heaven.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“Although they be difficult, things that are possible may still be hoped\r\nto come to pass. Therefore we shall in our times perhaps yet see him on\r\nearth; for although the heavens are so chary of producing excellent\r\nprinces that hardly one is seen in many centuries, this good fortune may\r\nfall to us.”\r\n\r\nThen Count Ludovico said:\r\n\r\n“I certainly trust that it may be so; for, besides those three great\r\nprinces whom we have named, to whom we may look for that which has been\r\nsaid to befit the highest type of a perfect prince,—there are also to be\r\nfound in Italy to-day several princes’ sons, who, although they are not\r\nlikely to have such great power, will perhaps fill its place with worth.\r\nAnd the one among them all who shows the best natural bent, and gives\r\ngreater promise than any of the others, seems to me to be my lord\r\nFederico Gonzaga, eldest son of the Marquess of Mantua and nephew to our\r\nlady Duchess here.[463] For besides the gentleness of behaviour and the\r\ndiscretion which he shows at such a tender age, those who have charge of\r\nhim tell wonderful things of his capacity, eagerness for honour,\r\nmagnanimity, courtesy, generosity, love of justice; so that from so good\r\na beginning we cannot but hope for the best of ends.”\r\n\r\nThen Frisio said:\r\n\r\n“No more of this at present; we will pray God that we may see this hope\r\nof yours fulfilled.”\r\n\r\n43.—Here my lord Ottaviano, turning to my lady Duchess with an air of\r\nhaving finished his discourse, said:\r\n\r\n“There, my Lady, is what occurs to me to say about the aim of the\r\nCourtier; wherein, if I shall not have wholly given satisfaction, it\r\nwill at least be enough for me to have shown that some further\r\nperfection could be given him in addition to the things mentioned by\r\nthese gentlemen; who, methinks, omitted both this and all that I might\r\nsay, not because they did not know it better than I, but in order to\r\nsave themselves trouble; therefore I will leave them to continue, if\r\nthey have anything left to say.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“Not only is the hour so late that it will soon be time to stop for the\r\nevening, but it seems to me that we ought not to mingle any other\r\ndiscourse with this; wherein you have gathered so many different and\r\nbeautiful things, that we may say (touching the aim of Courtiership) not\r\nonly that you are the perfect Courtier whom we seek, and competent to\r\ninstruct your prince rightly, but if fortune shall be favourable to you,\r\nthat you ought also to be an admirable prince, which would be of great\r\nadvantage to your country.”[464]\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“If I held such rank, my Lady, perhaps it would be with me as it is wont\r\nto be with many others, who know better how to speak than to act.”\r\n\r\n44.—Here the matter having been debated back and forth awhile among the\r\nwhole company, with some little contradiction albeit in praise of what\r\nhad been said, and it being suggested that it was not yet time to go to\r\nrest, the Magnifico Giuliano said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, I am so great an enemy to guile, that I am forced to\r\ncontradict my lord Ottaviano, who, from having (as I fear) conspired\r\nsecretly with my lord Gaspar against women, has fallen into two errours\r\nto my thinking very grave: one of which is, that in order to set this\r\nCourtier above the Court Lady and make him transcend the bounds that she\r\ncan reach, my lord Ottaviano has set the Courtier also above the prince,\r\nwhich is most unseemly; the other is in setting him such a goal that it\r\nis always difficult, and sometimes impossible for him to reach it, and\r\nthat even when he does reach it, he ought not to be called a Courtier.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand,” said my lady Emilia, “how it should be so\r\ndifficult or impossible for the Courtier to reach this goal of his, nor\r\nyet how my lord Ottaviano has set him above the prince.”[465]\r\n\r\n“Do not grant him these things,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “for I have\r\nnot set the Courtier above the prince, nor do I think I have fallen into\r\nany errour touching the aim of Courtiership.”\r\n\r\nThen the Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“You cannot say, my lord Ottaviano, that the cause which gives a certain\r\nquality to a result, does not always have more of that quality than its\r\nresult has. Thus the Courtier, through whose instruction the prince is\r\nto become so excellent, must needs be more excellent than his prince;\r\nand in this way he will also be of greater dignity than the prince\r\nhimself, which is most unseemly.\r\n\r\n“Then, as for the aim of Courtiership, what you said may be true when\r\nthe prince’s age is little different from the Courtier’s, but still not\r\nwithout difficulty, for where there is small difference in age, it is\r\nnatural that there should be small difference in knowledge also; while\r\nif the prince is old and the Courtier young, it is fitting that the old\r\nprince should know more than the young Courtier; and if this does not\r\nalways happen, it happens sometimes, and then the goal which you set the\r\nCourtier is impossible. Again, if the prince is young and the Courtier\r\nold, the Courtier can hardly win the prince’s mind by means of those\r\naccomplishments that you have ascribed to him. For to say the truth,\r\njousting and other exercises of the person belong to young men and do\r\nnot befit old men, and music and dancing and festivals and games and\r\nlove-making are ridiculous in old age; and methinks they would be very\r\nill-befitting a director of the prince’s life and behaviour, who ought\r\nto be a very sober person of authority, mature in years and experience,\r\nand (if possible) a good philosopher, a good commander, and ought to\r\nknow almost everything.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I think that whoever instructs the prince ought not to be\r\ncalled a Courtier, but deserves a far higher and more honoured name. So\r\npardon me, my lord Ottaviano, if I have exposed your fallacy; for\r\nmethinks I am bound to do so for the honour of my Lady, whom you,\r\nforsooth, would have of less dignity than this Courtier of yours, and I\r\nwill not allow it.”\r\n\r\n45.—My lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Magnifico, it would be more praise to the Court Lady to exalt\r\nher until she equalled the Courtier, than to abase the Courtier until he\r\nequalled the Court Lady; for it would be by no means forbidden the Lady\r\nto teach the mistress also, and with her to tend towards that aim of\r\nCourtiership which I said befits the Courtier with the prince. But you\r\nseek more to censure the Courtier than to praise the Court Lady; hence I\r\ntoo shall be allowed to take the Courtier’s part.\r\n\r\n“To reply, then, to your objections, I declare I did not say that the\r\nCourtier’s instruction ought to be the sole cause of making the prince\r\nsuch as we would have him. For if he were not by nature inclined and\r\nfitted to be so, all the Courtier’s care and reminders would be in vain:\r\njust as any good husbandman also would labour in vain if he were to set\r\nabout cultivating barren sea-sand and sowing it with excellent seed,\r\nbecause such barrenness is natural in that place; but when to good seed\r\nin fertile soil, and to mildness of climate and rains suited to the\r\nseason, there is added also the diligence of human culture, very\r\nabundant crops are always found to spring up plenteously. Nor is it on\r\nthat account true that the husbandman alone is the cause of this,\r\nalthough without him all the other things would avail little or nothing.\r\nThus there are many princes who would be good if their minds were\r\nrightly cultivated; and it is of these that I am speaking, not of those\r\nwho are like barren ground, and by nature so alien to good behaviour\r\nthat no training avails to lead their minds in the straight path.\r\n\r\n46.—“And since, as we have already said, our habits are what our actions\r\nmake them, and virtue consists in action, it is not impossible or\r\nmarvellous that the Courtier should turn the prince to many virtues,\r\nlike justice, generosity, magnanimity, the practice whereof the prince\r\nby his greatness can easily put in use and convert into habit; which the\r\nCourtier cannot do, because he has not the means to practise them; and\r\nthus the prince, allured to virtue by the Courtier, may become more\r\nvirtuous than the Courtier. Moreover you must know that the whetstone,\r\nalthough it cuts nothing, yet makes iron sharp. Hence it seems to me\r\nthat although the Courtier instructs the prince, he need not on that\r\naccount be said to be of more dignity than the prince.\r\n\r\n“That the aim of this Courtiership is difficult and sometimes\r\nimpossible, and that even when the Courtier attains it, he ought not to\r\nbe called a Courtier, but deserves a greater name,—I say that I do not\r\ndeny this difficulty, since it is not less difficult to find so\r\nexcellent a Courtier than to attain such an end. Yet methinks there is\r\nno impossibility, even in the case that you cited: for if the Courtier\r\nis too young to know that which we have said he ought to know, we need\r\nnot speak of him, since he is not the Courtier we are presupposing, nor\r\nis it possible that one who has to know so many things should be very\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n“And if, indeed, the prince shall chance to be so wise and good by\r\nnature that he has no need of precepts and counsel from others (although\r\neveryone knows how difficult this is), it will be enough for the\r\nCourtier to be such a man as could make the prince virtuous if he had\r\nneed of it. And then the Courtier will be at least able to perform the\r\nother part of his duty,—not to allow his prince to be deceived, always\r\nto make known the truth about everything, and to set himself against\r\nflatterers and slanderers and all those who plot to debase his prince’s\r\nmind with unworthy pleasures. And in this way he will also attain his\r\nend in great part, although he cannot put everything in practice: which\r\nwill not be a reason for finding fault with him, since he refrains\r\ntherefrom for so good a cause. For if an excellent physician were to\r\nfind himself in a place where everyone was in health, it would not for\r\nthat reason be right to say that this physician failed in his aim,\r\nalthough he healed no sick. Thus, just as the physician’s aim ought to\r\nbe men’s health, so the Courtier’s ought to be his prince’s virtue; and\r\nit is enough for them both to have their aim latent within their power,\r\nif their failure to attain it openly in acts arises from the subject to\r\nwhich the aim is directed.\r\n\r\n“But if the Courtier were so old that it would not become him to\r\npractise music, festivals, games, arms, and the other personal\r\naccomplishments, still we cannot say that it is impossible for him to\r\nwin his prince’s favour by that road. For if his age prevents his\r\npractising those things, it does not prevent his understanding them, and\r\nif he has practised them in his youth, it does not prevent his having\r\nthe more perfect judgment regarding them, and his knowing the more\r\nperfectly how to teach them to his prince, in proportion as years and\r\nexperience bring more knowledge of everything. Thus, although the old\r\nCourtier does not practise the accomplishments ascribed to him, he will\r\nyet attain his aim of instructing his prince rightly.\r\n\r\n47.—“And if you are unwilling to call him Courtier, it does not trouble\r\nme; for nature has not set such limit upon human dignities that a man\r\nmay not mount from one to another. Thus, common soldiers often become\r\ncaptains; private persons, kings; and priests, popes; and pupils,\r\nmasters; and thus, together with the dignity, they acquire the name\r\nalso. Hence perhaps we might say that to become his prince’s instructor\r\nwas the Courtier’s aim. However, I do not know who would refuse this\r\nname of perfect Courtier, which in my opinion is worthy of very great\r\npraise. And it seems to me that just as Homer described two most\r\nexcellent men as patterns of human life,—the one in deeds (which was\r\nAchilles), the other in sufferings and endurance (which was Ulysses),—so\r\nalso he described a perfect Courtier (which was Phœnix), who, after\r\nnarrating his loves and many other youthful affairs, says that he was\r\nsent to Achilles by the latter’s father, Peleus, as a companion and to\r\nteach the youth how to speak and act: which is naught else but the aim\r\nwhich we have marked out for our Courtier.[466]\r\n\r\n“Nor do I think that Aristotle and Plato would have scorned the name of\r\nperfect Courtier, for we clearly see that they performed the works of\r\nCourtiership and wrought to this end,—the one with Alexander the Great,\r\nthe other with the kings of Sicily. And since the office of a good\r\nCourtier is to know the prince’s character and inclinations, and thus to\r\nenter tactfully into his favour according to need and opportunity, as we\r\nhave said, by those ways that afford safe access, and then to lead him\r\ntowards virtue,—Aristotle so well knew the character of Alexander, and\r\ntactfully fostered it so well, that he was loved and honoured more than\r\na father by Alexander.[467] Thus, among many other tokens that Alexander\r\ngave him of good will, the king ordered the rebuilding of his native\r\ncity, Stagira, which had been destroyed;[468] and besides directing\r\nAlexander to that most glorious aim,—which was the desire to make the\r\nworld as one single universal country, and all men as a single people to\r\nlive in amity and mutual concord under a single government and a single\r\nlaw, which should shine equally on all like the light of the\r\nsun,[469]—Aristotle so instructed him in the natural sciences and in the\r\nvirtues of the mind as to make him most wise, brave, continent, and a\r\ntrue moral philosopher, not only in words but in deeds; for a nobler\r\nphilosophy cannot be imagined than to bring into civilized living such\r\nsavage people as those who inhabited Bactria and Caucasia, India,\r\nScythia;[470] and to teach them marriage, agriculture, honour to their\r\nfathers, abstention from rapine, murder and other evil ways; to build so\r\nmany very noble cities in distant lands;—so that countless men were by\r\nhis laws reduced from savage life to civilization. And of these\r\nachievements of Alexander the author was Aristotle, using the means of a\r\ngood Courtier: which Callisthenes knew not how to do, although Aristotle\r\nshowed him;[471] for in his wish to be a pure philosopher and austere\r\nminister of naked truth, without mingling Courtiership therewith, he\r\nlost his life and brought not help but rather infamy to Alexander.\r\n\r\n“By these same means of Courtiership, Plato schooled Dio of\r\nSyracuse;[472] and having afterwards found the tyrant Dionysius like a\r\nbook all full of faults and errours and in need of complete erasure\r\nrather than of any change or correction (since it was not possible to\r\nremove from him that tinge of tyranny wherewith he had so long been\r\nstained), Plato was unwilling to practise the ways of Courtiership upon\r\nhim, thinking that they all would surely be in vain. Which our Courtier\r\nalso ought to do, if by chance he finds himself in the service of a\r\nprince of so evil a disposition as to be inveterate in vice, like\r\nconsumptives in their malady; for in such case he ought to escape that\r\nbondage, in order not to receive blame for his lord’s evil deeds, and in\r\norder not to feel that distress which all good men feel who serve the\r\nwicked.”\r\n\r\n48.—Here my lord Ottaviano having ceased speaking, my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I did not in the least suspect that our Courtier was so honoured; but\r\nsince Aristotle and Plato are his fellows, I think that no one ought\r\nhenceforth to scorn this name. Still I am far from sure whether I\r\nbelieve that Aristotle and Plato ever danced or made music in their\r\nlives, or performed any other acts of chivalry.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Ottaviano replied:\r\n\r\n“It is hardly permitted to think that these two divine spirits did not\r\nknow everything, and hence we may believe that they practised what\r\npertains to Courtiership, for on occasion they write of it in such\r\nfashion that the very masters of the subjects written of by them\r\nperceive that they understood the same to the marrow and deepest roots.\r\nWherefore there is no ground for saying that all the accomplishments\r\nascribed to him by these gentlemen do not befit a Courtier (or\r\ninstructor of the prince, as you like to call him) who contributes to\r\nthat good end which we have mentioned, even though he were a very stern\r\nphilosopher and most saintly in his behaviour, because they are not at\r\nvariance with goodness, discretion, wisdom, worth, at every age and in\r\nevery time and place.”\r\n\r\n49.—Then my lord Gaspar said:\r\n\r\n“I remember that in discussing the accomplishments of the Courtier last\r\nevening, these gentlemen desired that he should be in love; and since,\r\nby reviewing what has thus far been said, we might conclude that a\r\nCourtier who has to allure his prince to virtue by his worth and\r\nauthority, must almost of necessity be old (because knowledge very\r\nrarely comes before years, and especially in those things that are\r\nlearned by experience),—I do not know how becoming it is for him (being\r\nadvanced in age) to be in love. For as has been said this evening, love\r\ndoes not sit well upon old men, and those things which in young men are\r\ndelights, courtesies and elegances very pleasing to women, in old men\r\nare extravagances and ridiculous incongruities, and for him who\r\npractises them win hatred from women and derision from others.\r\n\r\n“So if your friend Aristotle, the old Courtier, were in love, and did\r\nthose things which young lovers do, like some whom we have seen in our\r\ndays,—I fear he would forget to instruct his prince, and perhaps\r\nchildren would mock at him behind his back, and women would get little\r\npleasure from him except to deride him.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Ottaviano said:\r\n\r\n“As all the other accomplishments ascribed to the Courtier befit him\r\nalthough he be old, methinks we ought by no means to deprive him of this\r\nenjoyment of loving.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said my lord Gaspar, “to deprive him of love is to give him an\r\nadded perfection, and to make him live at ease remote from misery and\r\ncalamity.”\r\n\r\n50.—Messer Pietro Bembo said:\r\n\r\n“Do you not remember, my lord Gaspar, that although he is little skilled\r\nin love, yet in his game the other evening my lord Ottaviano seemed to\r\nknow that there are some lovers who call sweet the scorns and ires and\r\nwarrings and torments which they have from their ladies; whence he asked\r\nto be taught the cause of this sweetness? Therefore if our Courtier,\r\nalthough old, were inflamed with those loves that are sweet without\r\nbitterness, he would feel no calamity or misery in them; and if he were\r\nwise, as we suppose him to be, he would not deceive himself by thinking\r\nthat all was befitting to him which befits young men; but if he loved,\r\nperhaps he would love in a way that would bring him not only no blame,\r\nbut much praise and highest happiness unaccompanied by any pain, which\r\nrarely and almost never happens with young men; and thus he would not\r\nfail to instruct his prince, nor would he do aught to deserve the\r\nmockery of children.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess said:\r\n\r\n“I am glad, messer Pietro, that you have had little fatigue in our\r\ndiscussion this evening, for now we shall with more assurance impose on\r\nyou the burden of speaking, and of teaching the Courtier this love which\r\nis so happy that it brings with it neither blame nor discomfort; for\r\nperhaps it will be one of the most important and useful attributes that\r\nhave thus far been ascribed to him: therefore tell us, on your faith,\r\nall you know about it.”\r\n\r\nMesser Pietro laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“I should be sorry, my Lady, that my saying it is permissible for old\r\nmen to love should be a reason for these ladies to regard me as old;\r\ntherefore please to give this task to someone else.”[473]\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess replied:\r\n\r\n“You ought not to shun being reputed old in wisdom, even if you are\r\nyoung in years; so speak on, and make no more excuse.”\r\n\r\nMesser Pietro said:\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my Lady, if I must talk about this matter, I should need to go\r\ntake counsel with my Lavinello’s Hermit.”[474]\r\n\r\nThen my lady Emilia said, half vexed:\r\n\r\n“Messer Pietro, there is no one in the company who is more disobedient\r\nthan you; therefore it will be well for my lady Duchess to inflict some\r\nchastisement upon you.”\r\n\r\nMesser Pietro said, again smiling:\r\n\r\n“Be not angry with me, my Lady, for love of God; for I will tell what\r\nyou wish.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell it at once,” replied my lady Emilia.\r\n\r\n51.—Whereupon messer Pietro, having first remained silent awhile, then\r\nsettled himself a little as if about to speak of something important,\r\nand spoke thus:[475]\r\n\r\n“My Lords, in order to prove that old men can love not only without\r\nblame but sometimes more happily than young men, it will be needful for\r\nme to make a little discourse to explain what love is, and in what\r\nconsists the happiness that lovers may enjoy. So I pray you hear me with\r\nattention, for I hope to make you see that there is no man here whom it\r\ndoes not become to be in love, even though he were fifteen or twenty\r\nyears older than my lord Morello.”\r\n\r\nAnd then after some laughter, messer Pietro continued:\r\n\r\n“I say, then, that according to the definition of the ancient sages love\r\nis naught but a certain desire to enjoy beauty; and as desire longs only\r\nfor things that are perceived, perception must needs always precede\r\ndesire, which by its nature wishes good things, but in itself is blind\r\nand does not perceive them. Therefore nature has so ordained that to\r\nevery faculty of perception there is joined a certain faculty of\r\nappetite; and since in our soul there are three modes of perceiving,\r\nthat is, by sense, by reason, and by intellect: from sense springs\r\nappetite, which we have in common with the brutes; from reason springs\r\nchoice, which is peculiar to man; from the intellect, by which man is\r\nable to commune with the angels, springs will. Thus, just as sense\r\nperceives only things that are perceptible by the senses, appetite\r\ndesires the same only; and just as intellect is directed solely to the\r\ncontemplation of things intellectual, the will feeds only upon spiritual\r\nbenefits. Being by nature rational and placed as a mean between these\r\ntwo extremes, man is able at will (by descending to sense or mounting to\r\nintellect) to turn his desires now in the one direction and now in the\r\nother. In these two ways, therefore, it is possible to desire beauty,\r\nwhich universal name applies to all things (whether natural or\r\nartificial) that are framed in good proportion and due measure according\r\nto their nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PIETRO BEMBO\r\n  1470-1547\r\n]\r\n\r\nMuch enlarged from a photographic print of a medal in the King’s\r\n    Library, British Museum. This is probably the medal for which\r\n    Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1572), in his autobiography, describes\r\n    making a sketch from life in 1537. See Émile Molinier’s monograph on\r\n    Cellini in the series, _Les Artistes Célèbres_, published at Paris\r\n    by the _Librairie de l'Art_, p. 33; and Armand’s _Les Médailleurs\r\n    Italiens_, i, 150.\r\n\r\n52.—“But speaking of the beauty we have in mind, which is only that\r\nwhich is seen in the bodies and especially in the faces of men, and\r\nwhich excites this ardent desire that we call love,—we will say that it\r\nis an effluence of divine goodness, and that although it is diffused\r\nlike the sun’s light upon all created things, yet when it finds a face\r\nwell proportioned and framed with a certain pleasant harmony of various\r\ncolours embellished by lights and shadows and by an orderly distance and\r\nlimit of outlines, it infuses itself therein and appears most beautiful,\r\nand adorns and illumines that object whereon it shines with grace and\r\nwonderful splendour, like a sunbeam falling upon a beautiful vase of\r\npolished gold set with precious gems. Thus it agreeably attracts the\r\neyes of men, and entering thereby, it impresses itself upon the soul,\r\nand stirs and delights her with a new sweetness throughout, and by\r\nkindling her it excites in her a desire for its own self.\r\n\r\n“Then, being seized with desire to enjoy this beauty as something good,\r\nif the soul allows herself to be guided by the judgment of sense, she\r\nruns into very grievous errours, and judges that the body wherein the\r\nbeauty is seen is the chief cause thereof; and hence, in order to enjoy\r\nthat beauty, she deems it necessary to join herself as closely to that\r\nbody as she can; which is false: and accordingly, whoever thinks to\r\nenjoy the beauty by possessing the body deceives himself, and is moved,\r\nnot by true perception through reasonable choice, but by false opinion\r\nthrough sensual appetite: wherefore the pleasure also that results\r\ntherefrom is necessarily false and vicious.\r\n\r\n“Hence all those lovers who satisfy their unchaste desires with the\r\nwomen whom they love, run into one of two errours: for as soon as they\r\nhave attained the end desired, they either not only feel satiety and\r\ntedium, but hate the beloved object as if appetite repented its errour\r\nand perceived the deceit practised upon it by the false judgment of\r\nsense, which made it believe evil to be good; or else they remain in the\r\nsame desire and longing, like those who have not truly attained the end\r\nthey sought. And although, by reason of the blind opinion wherewith they\r\nare intoxicated, they think they feel pleasure at the moment, as the\r\nsick sometimes dream of drinking at some clear spring, nevertheless they\r\nare not contented or appeased. And since the possession of a wished-for\r\njoy always brings quiet and satisfaction to the mind of the possessor,\r\nif that joy were the true and worthy object of their desire, they would\r\nremain quiet and satisfied in possessing it; which they do not. Nay,\r\ndeceived by that likeness, they soon return to unbridled desire, and\r\nwith the same distress they felt at first, they find themselves\r\nfuriously and very ardently athirst for that which they vainly hope to\r\npossess perfectly.\r\n\r\n“Such lovers as these, therefore, love most unhappily; for either they\r\nnever attain their desires (which is great unhappiness), or if they do\r\nattain thereto, they find they have attained their woe, and finish their\r\nmiseries with other miseries still greater; because even in the\r\nbeginning and midst of their love naught else is ever felt but anguish,\r\ntorments, sorrows, sufferings, toils. So that to be pale, melancholy, in\r\ncontinual tears and sighs, to be sad, to be ever silent or lamenting, to\r\nlong for death, in short, to be most unhappy, are the conditions that\r\nare said to befit lovers.\r\n\r\n53.—“The cause, then, of this havoc in the minds of men is chiefly\r\nsense, which is very potent in youth, because the vigour of flesh and\r\nblood at that period gives to it as much strength as it takes away from\r\nreason, and hence easily leads the soul to follow appetite. For, finding\r\nherself plunged into an earthly prison and deprived of spiritual\r\ncontemplation by being set the task of governing the body, the soul\r\ncannot of herself clearly comprehend the truth; wherefore, in order to\r\nhave perception of things, she must needs go begging first notions from\r\nthe senses, and so she believes them and bows before them and allows\r\nherself to be guided by them, especially when they have so much vigour\r\nthat they almost force her; and as they are fallacious, they fill her\r\nwith errours and false opinions.\r\n\r\n“Hence it nearly always happens that young men are wrapped in this love\r\nwhich is sensual and wholly rebellious to reason, and thus they become\r\nunworthy to enjoy the graces and benefits which love bestows upon its\r\ntrue subjects; nor do they feel any pleasures in love beyond those which\r\nthe unreasoning animals feel, but anguish far more grievous.\r\n\r\n“This premise being admitted then,—and it is most true,—I say that the\r\ncontrary happens to those who are of maturer age. For if such as these\r\n(when the soul is already less weighed down by bodily heaviness and when\r\nthe natural heat begins to become tepid) are inflamed by beauty and turn\r\nthereto a desire guided by rational choice,—they are not deceived, and\r\npossess beauty perfectly. Therefore their possession of it always brings\r\nthem good; because beauty is good, and hence true love of beauty is most\r\ngood and holy, and always works for good in the mind of those who\r\nrestrain the perversity of sense with the bridle of reason; which the\r\nold can do much more easily than the young.\r\n\r\n54.—“Hence it is not beyond reason to say further that the old can love\r\nwithout blame and more happily than the young; taking this word old,\r\nhowever, not in the sense of decrepit, nor when the bodily organs have\r\nalready become so weak that the soul cannot perform its functions\r\nthrough them, but when our knowledge is at its true prime.\r\n\r\n“I will not refrain from saying also this: which is, that I think that\r\nalthough sensual love is evil at every age, yet in the young it deserves\r\nexcuse, and is perhaps in a measure permitted. For although it gives\r\nthem anguish, dangers, toils, and those woes that have been told, still\r\nthere are many who, to win the favour of the ladies of their love, do\r\nworthy acts, which (although not directed to a good end) are\r\nintrinsically good; and thus from that mass of bitterness they extract a\r\nlittle sweet, and through the adversities which they endure they at last\r\nperceive their errour. Hence, just as I deem those youths divine who\r\ncontrol their appetites and love in reason, so I excuse those who allow\r\nthemselves to be overcome by sensual love, to which they are so strongly\r\ninclined by human frailty: provided they show therein gentleness,\r\ncourtesy and worth, and the other noble qualities of which these\r\ngentlemen have told; and provided that when they are no longer of\r\nyouthful age, they abandon it altogether, shunning this sensual desire\r\nas it were the lowest round of the ladder by which true love can be\r\nattained. But if, even after they are old, they preserve the fire of\r\nappetite in their chill heart and subject stout reason to frail sense,\r\nit is not possible to say how much they are to be blamed. For like fools\r\nthey deserve to be numbered with perpetual infamy among the unreasoning\r\nanimals, since the thoughts and ways of sensual love are too unbecoming\r\nto mature age.”\r\n\r\n55.—Here Bembo paused a little, as if to rest; and as everyone remained\r\nsilent, my lord Morello da Ortona said:\r\n\r\n“And if an old man were found more vigourous and sturdy and of better\r\nlooks than many youths, why would you not have him allowed to love with\r\nthat love wherewith young men love?”\r\n\r\nMy lady Duchess laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“If young men’s love is so unhappy, my lord Morello, why do you wish to\r\nhave old men love thus unhappily also? But if you were old, as these\r\ngentlemen say, you would not thus contrive evil for old men.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Morello replied:\r\n\r\n“Methinks it is messer Pietro Bembo who is contriving evil for old men,\r\nin that he wishes to have them love in a certain way which I for my part\r\ndo not understand; and methinks that to possess this beauty which he so\r\nhighly praises, without the body, is a dream.”\r\n\r\nThen Count Ludovico said:\r\n\r\n“Do you believe, my lord Morello, that beauty is always as good as\r\nmesser Pietro Bembo says?”\r\n\r\n“Not I indeed,” replied my lord Morello; “nay, I remember having seen\r\nmany beautiful women who were very bad, cruel and spiteful; and this\r\nseems to be almost always so, for beauty makes them proud, and pride\r\nmakes them cruel.”\r\n\r\nCount Ludovico said, laughing:\r\n\r\n“To you, perhaps, they seem cruel because they do not grant you what you\r\nwould have; but have yourself taught by messer Pietro Bembo in what way\r\nold men ought to desire beauty, and what they ought to seek from women,\r\nand with what they ought to be content; and if you do not exceed these\r\nlimits, you shall see that they will not be either proud or cruel, and\r\nwill grant you what you wish.”\r\n\r\nThen my lord Morello seemed a little vexed, and said:\r\n\r\n“I have no wish to know what does not concern me; but do you have\r\nyourself taught how this beauty ought to be desired by young men who are\r\nless vigourous and sturdy than their elders.”\r\n\r\n56.—Here messer Federico, to quiet my lord Morello and turn the\r\nconversation, did not allow Count Ludovico to reply, but interrupted him\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“Perhaps my lord Morello is not altogether wrong in saying that beauty\r\nis not always good; for women’s beauty is often the cause that brings\r\nupon the world countless evils, hatreds, wars, deaths and destructions;\r\nof which good proof can be found in the fall of Troy. And beautiful\r\nwomen are for the most part either proud or cruel, or (as has been said)\r\nimmodest; but this would not seem to my lord Morello a fault. There are\r\nalso many wicked men who have the gift of fair looks, and it seems that\r\nnature made them thus to the end that they should be better fitted to\r\ndeceive, and that this gracious seeming is like the bait upon the hook.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Pietro Bembo said:\r\n\r\n“Do not believe that beauty is not always good.”\r\n\r\nHere Count Ludovico, in order to return to the original subject,\r\ninterrupted and said:\r\n\r\n“Since my lord Morello does not care to know what so deeply concerns\r\nhim, teach it to me, and show me how old men attain this happiness in\r\nlove, for I shall not mind having myself thought old, provided it help\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n57.—Messer Pietro laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“I wish first to free these gentlemen’s minds from their errour; then I\r\nwill satisfy you too.” Resuming thus, he said:\r\n\r\n“My Lords, I would not have any of us, like profane and sacrilegious\r\nmen, incur God’s wrath by speaking ill of beauty, which is a sacred\r\nthing. Therefore, to the end that my lord Morello and messer Federico\r\nmay be warned, and not lose their sight, like Stesichorus (which is a\r\nvery fitting punishment for one who scorns beauty),[476] I say that\r\nbeauty springs from God, and is like a circle of which goodness is the\r\ncentre. And hence, as there can be no circle without a centre, there can\r\nbe no beauty without goodness. Thus a wicked soul rarely inhabits a\r\nbeautiful body, and for that reason outward beauty is a true sign of\r\ninward goodness. And this grace is impressed upon bodies, more or less,\r\nas an index of the soul, whereby she is known outwardly, as in the case\r\nof trees, in which the beauty of the blossom gives token of the\r\nexcellence of the fruit. The same is true in the case of human bodies,\r\nas we see that the Physiognomists often recognize in the face the\r\ncharacter and sometimes the thoughts of men; and what is more, in beasts\r\nalso we discern from the aspect the quality of the mind, which is\r\nexpressed as much as possible in the body. Think how clearly we read\r\nanger, ferocity and pride in the face of the lion, the horse, the eagle;\r\na pure and simple innocence in lambs and doves; cunning malice in foxes\r\nand wolves, and so of nearly all other animals.\r\n\r\n58.—“The ugly are therefore for the most part wicked too, and the\r\nbeautiful are good: and we may say that beauty is the pleasant, gay,\r\nacceptable and desirable face of good, and that ugliness is the dark,\r\ndisagreeable, unpleasant and sad face of evil. And if you will consider\r\nall things, you will find that those which are good and useful always\r\nhave a charm of beauty also.\r\n\r\n“Look at the state of this great fabric of the world, which was made by\r\nGod for the health and preservation of every created thing. The round\r\nfirmament, adorned with so many heavenly lights, and the earth in the\r\ncentre, surrounded by the elements and sustained by its own weight; the\r\nsun, which in its revolving illumines the whole, and in winter\r\napproaches the lowest sign, then little by little mounts to the other\r\nside; the moon, which derives her light from it, according as it\r\napproaches her or withdraws from her; and the five other stars, which\r\nseparately travel the same course.[477] These things have such influence\r\nupon one another through the linking of an order thus precisely framed,\r\nthat if they were changed for an instant, they could not hold together,\r\nand would wreck the world; they have also such beauty and grace that\r\nhuman wit cannot imagine anything more beautiful.\r\n\r\n“Think now of the shape of man, which may be called a little world;\r\nwherein we see every part of the body precisely composed with skill, and\r\nnot by chance; and then the whole form together so beautiful that we\r\ncould hardly decide whether more utility or more grace is given to the\r\nhuman features and the rest of the body by all the members, such as the\r\neyes, nose, mouth, ears, arms, breast, and other parts withal. The same\r\ncan be said of all the animals. Look at the feathers of birds, the\r\nleaves and branches of trees, which are given them by nature to preserve\r\ntheir being, and yet have also very great loveliness.\r\n\r\n“Leave nature, and come to art. What thing is so necessary in ships as\r\nthe prow, the sides, the yards, the masts, the sails, the helm, the\r\noars, the anchors and the cordage? Yet all these things have so much\r\ncomeliness, that it seems to him who looks upon them that they are thus\r\ndevised as much for beauty as for use. Columns and architraves support\r\nlofty galleries and palaces, yet they are not on that account less\r\npleasing to the eyes of him who looks upon them, than useful to the\r\nbuildings. When men first began to build, they set that middle ridge in\r\ntheir temples and houses, not in order that the buildings might have\r\nmore grace, but to the end that the water might flow off conveniently on\r\neither side; yet to utility soon was added comeliness, so that if a\r\ntemple were built under a sky where no hail or rain falls, it would not\r\nseem able to have any dignity or beauty without the ridge.\r\n\r\n59.—“Much praise is therefore bestowed, not only upon other things, but\r\nupon the world, by saying that it is beautiful. We praise when we say:\r\n‘Beautiful sky, beautiful earth, beautiful sea, beautiful rivers,\r\nbeautiful lands, beautiful woods, trees, gardens; beautiful cities,\r\nbeautiful churches, houses, armies.’ In short, this gracious and sacred\r\nbeauty gives highest ornament to everything; and we may say that the\r\ngood and the beautiful are in a way one and the same thing, and\r\nespecially in the human body; of whose beauty I think the most immediate\r\ncause is beauty of the soul, which (as partaker of true divine beauty)\r\nbrightens and beautifies whatever it touches, and especially if the body\r\nwherein it dwells is not of such base material that it cannot impress\r\nthereon its quality. Therefore beauty is the true trophy of the soul’s\r\nvictory, when with power divine she holds sway over material nature, and\r\nby her light overcomes the darkness of the body.\r\n\r\n“Hence we must not say that beauty makes women proud or cruel, although\r\nit may seem so to my lord Morello; nor yet ought we to ascribe to\r\nbeautiful women those enmities, deaths and destructions of which the\r\nimmoderate appetites of men are the cause. I do not by any means deny\r\nthat it is possible to find beautiful women in the world who are also\r\nimmodest, but it is not at all because their beauty inclines them to\r\nimmodesty; nay, it turns them therefrom and leads them to the path of\r\nvirtuous behaviour, by the connection that beauty has with goodness. But\r\nsometimes evil training, the continual urgence of their lovers, gifts,\r\npoverty, hope, deceits, fear and a thousand other causes, overcome the\r\nsteadfastness even of beautiful and good women; and through these or\r\nsimilar causes beautiful men also may become wicked.”\r\n\r\n60.—Then messer Cesare said:\r\n\r\n“If that is true which my lord Gaspar alleged yesterday, there is no\r\ndoubt that beautiful women are more chaste than ugly women.”\r\n\r\n“And what did I allege?” said my lord Gaspar.\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare replied:\r\n\r\n“If I remember rightly, you said that women who are wooed always refuse\r\nto satisfy him who wooes them, and that those who are not wooed woo\r\nothers. Certain it is that the beautiful are always more wooed and\r\nbesought in love than are the ugly; therefore the beautiful always\r\nrefuse, and hence are more chaste than the ugly, who, not being wooed,\r\nwoo others.”\r\n\r\nBembo laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“To this argument no answer can be made.” Then he added: “It often\r\nhappens also that our sight deceives us like our other senses, and\r\naccounts a face beautiful which in truth is not beautiful; and since in\r\nsome women’s eyes and whole aspect a certain wantonness is seen\r\ndepicted, together with unseemly blandishments,—many (who like such\r\nmanner because it promises them ease in attaining what they desire) call\r\nit beauty: but in truth it is disguised immodesty, unworthy a name so\r\nhonoured and so sacred.”\r\n\r\nMesser Pietro Bembo was silent, and those gentlemen still urged him to\r\nspeak further of this love and of the mode of enjoying beauty truly; and\r\nhe at last said:\r\n\r\n“Methinks I have shown clearly enough that old men can love more happily\r\nthan young, which was my thesis; therefore it does not become me to go\r\nfurther.”\r\n\r\nCount Ludovico replied:\r\n\r\n“You have better shown the unhappiness of youths than the happiness of\r\nold men, whom as yet you have not taught what road to follow in this\r\nlove of theirs, but have only told them to be guided by reason; and by\r\nmany it is thought impossible for love to abide with reason.”\r\n\r\n61.—Bembo still sought to put an end to his discourse, but my lady\r\nDuchess begged him to speak; and he began anew thus:\r\n\r\n“Too unhappy would human nature be, if our soul (wherein such ardent\r\ndesire can spring up easily) were forced to feed it solely upon that\r\nwhich is common to her with the beasts, and could not direct it to that\r\nother nobler part which is peculiar to herself. Therefore, since so\r\nindeed it pleases you, I have no wish to avoid discoursing upon this\r\nnoble subject. And as I feel myself unworthy to speak of Love’s most\r\nsacred mysteries, I pray him so to inspire my thought and tongue that I\r\nmay be able to show this excellent Courtier how to love beyond the\r\nmanner of the vulgar crowd; and since from boyhood up I have dedicated\r\nmy whole life to him, so now also may my words comport with this intent\r\nand with his praise.\r\n\r\n“I say, then, that as in youth human nature is so greatly prone to\r\nsense, the Courtier may be allowed to love sensually while he is young.\r\nBut if afterwards in maturer years he chances still to be kindled with\r\nthis amourous desire, he must be very wary and take care not to deceive\r\nhimself by allowing himself to be led into those calamities which in the\r\nyoung merit more compassion than blame, and, on the contrary, in the old\r\nmore blame than compassion.\r\n\r\n62.—“Therefore when the gracious aspect of some fair woman meets his\r\nview, accompanied with such sweet behaviour and gentle manners that he,\r\nas an adept in love, feels that his spirit accords with hers: as soon as\r\nhe finds that his eyes lay hold upon her image and carry it to his\r\nheart; and that his soul begins to contemplate her with pleasure and to\r\nfeel that influence within which stirs and warms it little by little;\r\nand that those quick spirits which shine out through the eyes\r\ncontinually add fresh tinder to the fire;—he ought at this first stage\r\nto provide a speedy cure, and arouse his reason, and therewith arm the\r\nfortress of his heart, and so shut the way to sense and appetite that\r\nthey cannot enter there by force or trickery. Thus, if the flame is\r\nextinguished, the danger is extinguished also; but if it survives or\r\ngrows, then the Courtier, feeling himself caught, must resolve on\r\nshunning wholly every stain of vulgar love, and thus enter on the path\r\nof divine love, with reason for guide. And first he must consider that\r\nthe body wherein this beauty shines is not the fountain whence it\r\nsprings, but rather that beauty (being an incorporeal thing and, as we\r\nhave said, a heavenly beam) loses much of its dignity when it finds\r\nitself joined to vile and corruptible matter; for the more perfect it is\r\nthe less it partakes thereof, and is most perfect when wholly separate\r\ntherefrom. And he must consider that just as one cannot hear with the\r\npalate or smell with the ears, so too can beauty in no wise be enjoyed,\r\nnor can the desire which it excites in our minds be satisfied, by means\r\nof touch, but by that sense of which this beauty is the very object,\r\nnamely, the power of vision.\r\n\r\n“Therefore let him shun the blind judgment of sense, and with his eyes\r\nenjoy the splendour of his lady, her grace, her amourous sparkle, the\r\nlaughs, the ways and all the other pleasant ornaments of her beauty.\r\nLikewise with his hearing let him enjoy the sweetness of her voice, the\r\nconcord of her words, the harmony of her music (if his beloved be a\r\nmusician). Thus will he feed his soul on sweetest food by means of these\r\ntwo senses—which have little of the corporeal and are ministers of\r\nreason—without passing in his desire for the body to any appetite less\r\nthan seemly.\r\n\r\n“Next let him obey, please and honour his lady with all reverence, and\r\nhold her dearer than himself, and prefer her convenience and pleasures\r\nto his own, and love in her not less the beauty of mind than that of\r\nbody. Therefore let him take care not to leave her to fall into any kind\r\nof errour, but by admonition and good advice let him always seek to lead\r\nher on to modesty, to temperance, to true chastity, and see to it that\r\nno thoughts find place in her except those that are pure and free from\r\nevery stain of vice; and by thus sowing virtue in the garden of her fair\r\nmind, he will gather fruits of fairest behaviour too, and will taste\r\nthem with wonderful delight. And this will be the true engendering and\r\nmanifesting of beauty in beauty, which by some is said to be the end of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n“In such fashion will our Courtier be most acceptable to his lady, and\r\nshe will always show herself obedient, sweet and affable to him, and as\r\ndesirous of pleasing him as of being loved by him; and the wishes of\r\nboth will be most virtuous and harmonious, and they themselves will thus\r\nbe very happy.”\r\n\r\n63.—Here my lord Morello said:\r\n\r\n“To engender beauty in beauty, forsooth, would be to beget a beautiful\r\nchild in a beautiful woman; and pleasing him in this would seem to me a\r\nmuch clearer token that she loved her lover than treating him with the\r\naffability of which you speak.”\r\n\r\nBembo laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“You must not go beyond bounds, my lord Morello; nor does a woman give\r\nsmall token of her love when she gives her lover her beauty, which is so\r\nprecious a thing, and by the ways that are the avenues to her soul (that\r\nis, sight and hearing) sends the glances of her eyes, the image of her\r\nface, her voice, her words, which strike home to the lover’s heart and\r\ngive him proof of her love.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Morello said:\r\n\r\n“Glances and words may be, and often are, false proofs; therefore he who\r\nhas no better pledge of love is, in my judgment, far from sure; and\r\ntruly I quite expected you to make this lady of yours a little more\r\ncourteous and generous to the Courtier than my lord Magnifico made his;\r\nbut methinks that both of you are in like case with those judges who\r\npronounce sentence against their friends for the sake of appearing\r\nwise.”\r\n\r\n64.—Bembo said:\r\n\r\n“I am very willing that this lady should be much more courteous to my\r\nunyouthful Courtier, than my lord Magnifico’s is to the youthful\r\nCourtier; and with reason, for my Courtier will desire only seemly\r\nthings, and therefore the lady can grant him all of them without blame;\r\nwhile my lord Magnifico’s lady, who is not so sure of the youthful\r\nCourtier’s modesty, ought to grant him only seemly things, and to refuse\r\nhim the unseemly. Hence my Courtier, to whom is granted what he asks, is\r\nmore happy than the other, to whom part is granted and part refused.\r\n\r\n“And to the end that you may still better understand that rational love\r\nis happier than sensual, I say that the same things ought sometimes to\r\nbe refused in sensual love and granted in rational love, because they\r\nare unseemly in the one and seemly in the other. Thus, to please her\r\nworthy lover, besides granting him pleasant smiles, familiar and secret\r\ndiscourse, and leave to joke and jest with her and to touch her hand,\r\nthe lady may in reason even go so far as kissing without blame, which is\r\nnot permitted in sensual love according to my lord Magnifico’s rules.\r\nFor since the kiss is the union of body and soul, there is danger lest\r\nthe sensual lover incline more in the direction of the body than in that\r\nof the soul; while the rational lover perceives that although the mouth\r\nis part of the body, yet it gives issue to words, which are interpreters\r\nof the soul, and to that inward breath which is itself even called soul.\r\nHence a man delights to join his mouth to that of his beloved in a kiss,\r\nnot in order to arouse any unseemly desire in him, but because he feels\r\nthat bond to be the opening of a passage between their souls, which,\r\nbeing each drawn by desire for the other, pour themselves each into the\r\nother’s body by turn, and so commingle that each has two souls, and a\r\nsingle soul (thus composed of these two) rules as it were over two\r\nbodies. Hence the kiss may be oftener said to be a joining of soul than\r\nof body, because it has such power over the soul that it draws her to\r\nitself and separates her from the body. On this account all chaste\r\nlovers desire to kiss as a joining of the soul; and thus the divinely\r\nenamoured Plato says that in kissing the soul came to his lips to escape\r\nhis body. And since the separation of the soul from things material, and\r\nits complete union with things spiritual, may be denoted by the kiss,\r\nSolomon, in his divine book of the Song, says: ‘Let him kiss me with the\r\nkiss of his mouth,’ to express desire that his soul might be so\r\ntransported with divine love to the contemplation of celestial beauty,\r\nthat by joining closely therewith she might forsake the body.”\r\n\r\n65.—Everyone gave closest heed to Bembo’s discourse; and he, having made\r\na little pause and seeing that no one else spoke, said:\r\n\r\n“As you have made me begin to teach our unyouthful Courtier happy love,\r\nI fain would lead him a little farther; for it is very dangerous to stop\r\nat this stage, seeing that the soul is very prone to the senses, as has\r\nmany times been said; and although reason and argument choose well and\r\nperceive that beauty does not spring from the body, and although they\r\ntherefore put a bridle upon unseemly desires, still, always\r\ncontemplating beauty in the body often perverts sound judgment. And even\r\nif no other evil flowed therefrom, absence from the beloved object\r\nbrings much suffering with it, because the influence of her beauty gives\r\nthe lover wonderful delight when she is present, and by warming his\r\nheart wakens and melts certain dormant and frozen forces in his soul,\r\nwhich (being nourished by the warmth of love) spread and blossom about\r\nhis heart, and send forth through the eyes those spirits that are very\r\nsubtle vapours made of the purest and brightest part of the blood, which\r\nreceive the image of her beauty and fashion it with a thousand various\r\nornaments. Hence the soul delights, and trembles with awe and yet\r\nrejoices, and as in a stupour feels not only pleasure, but that fear and\r\nreverence which we are wont to have for sacred things, and speaks of\r\nbeing in paradise.\r\n\r\n66.—“Therefore the lover who considers beauty in the body only, loses\r\nthis blessing and felicity as soon as his beloved lady by her absence\r\nleaves his eyes without their splendour, and his soul consequently\r\nwidowed of its blessing. Because, her beauty being far away, that\r\namourous influence does not warm his heart as it did in her presence;\r\nwherefore his pores become arid and dry, and still the memory of her\r\nbeauty stirs a little those forces of his soul, so that they seek to\r\nscatter abroad the spirits; and these, finding the ways shut, have no\r\nexit, and yet seek to issue forth; and thus hemmed in by those goads,\r\nthey sting the soul and give it keenest suffering, as in the case of\r\nchildren when the teeth begin to come through the tender gums. And from\r\nthis proceed the tears, the sighs, the anguish and the torments of\r\nlovers, because the soul is ever in affliction and travail, and becomes\r\nalmost raging until her dear beauty appears to it again; and then it\r\nsuddenly is calmed and breathes, and all intent upon that beauty it\r\nfeeds on sweetest food, nor would ever part from so delightful a\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\n“Hence, to escape the torment of this absence and to enjoy beauty\r\nwithout suffering, there is need that the Courtier should, with the aid\r\nof reason, wholly turn his desire from the body to the beauty alone, and\r\ncontemplate it in itself simple and pure, as far as he can, and fashion\r\nit in his imagination apart from all matter; and thus make it lovely and\r\ndear to his soul, and enjoy it there, and have it with him day and\r\nnight, in every time and place, without fear of ever losing it; bearing\r\nalways in mind that the body is something very different from beauty,\r\nand not only does not enhance it, but diminishes its perfection.\r\n\r\n“In this wise will our unyouthful Courtier be beyond all the bitterness\r\nand calamities that the young nearly always feel: such as jealousies,\r\nsuspicions, disdainings, angers, despairings, and certain furies full of\r\nmadness whereby they are often led into such errour that some of them\r\nnot only beat the women whom they love, but deprive themselves of life.\r\nHe will do no injury to the husband, father, brothers or kinsfolk of his\r\nbeloved lady; he will put no infamy upon her; he will never be forced to\r\nbridle his eyes and tongue with such difficulty in order not to disclose\r\nhis desires to others, or to endure suffering at partings or\r\nabsences;—because he will always carry his precious treasure with him\r\nshut up in his heart, and also by force of his imagination he will\r\ninwardly fashion her beauty much more beautiful than in fact it is.\r\n\r\n67.—“But besides these blessings the lover will find another much\r\ngreater still, if he will employ this love as a step to mount to one\r\nmuch higher; which he will succeed in doing if he continually considers\r\nwithin himself how narrow a restraint it is to be always occupied in\r\ncontemplating the beauty of one body only; and therefore, in order to\r\nescape such close bounds as these, in his thought he will little by\r\nlittle add so many ornaments, that by heaping all beauties together he\r\nwill form an universal concept, and will reduce the multitude of these\r\nbeauties to the unity of that single beauty which is spread over human\r\nnature at large. In this way he will no longer contemplate the\r\nparticular beauty of one woman, but that universal beauty which adorns\r\nall bodies; and thus, bewildered by this greater light, he will not heed\r\nthe lesser, and glowing with a purer flame, he will esteem lightly that\r\nwhich at first he so greatly prized.\r\n\r\n“This stage of love, although it be very noble and such as few attain,\r\nstill cannot be called perfect; for since the imagination is merely a\r\ncorporeal faculty and has no perception except through those means that\r\nare furnished it by the senses, it is not wholly purged of material\r\ndarkness; and hence, although it considers this universal beauty in the\r\nabstract and intrinsically, yet it does not discern that beauty very\r\nclearly or without some ambiguity, because of the likeness which\r\nphantoms bear to substance. Thus those who attain this love are like\r\ntender birds beginning to put on feathers, which, although with their\r\nfrail wings they lift themselves a little in flight, yet dare not go far\r\nfrom their nest or trust themselves to the winds and open sky.\r\n\r\n68.—“Therefore when our Courtier shall have reached this goal, although\r\nhe may be called a very happy lover by comparison with those who are\r\nplunged in the misery of sensual love, still I would have him not rest\r\ncontent, but press boldly on following along the lofty path after the\r\nguide who leads him to the goal of true felicity. And thus, instead of\r\ngoing outside himself in thought (as all must needs do who choose to\r\ncontemplate bodily beauty only), let him have recourse to himself, in\r\norder to contemplate that beauty which is seen by the eyes of the mind,\r\nwhich begin to be sharp and clear when those of the body lose the flower\r\nof their loveliness. Then the soul,—freed from vice, purged by studies\r\nof true philosophy, versed in spiritual life, and practised in matters\r\nof the intellect, devoted to the contemplation of her own substance,—as\r\nif awakened from deepest sleep, opens those eyes which all possess but\r\nfew use, and sees in herself a ray of that light which is the true image\r\nof the angelic beauty communicated to her, and of which she then\r\ncommunicates a faint shadow to the body. Grown blind to things earthly,\r\nthe soul thus becomes very keen-sighted to things heavenly; and\r\nsometimes, when the motive forces of the body are absorbed by earnest\r\ncontemplation or fettered by sleep, being unhampered by them, she is\r\nconscious of a certain far-off perfume of true angelic beauty, and\r\nravished by the splendour of that light, she begins to kindle and\r\npursues it so eagerly that she almost becomes phrensied with desire to\r\nunite herself to that beauty, thinking that she has found God’s\r\nfootstep, in the contemplation of which she seeks to rest as in her\r\nbeatific end. And thus, glowing in this most happy flame, she rises to\r\nher noblest part, which is the intellect; and here, no longer darkened\r\nby the gloomy night of things earthly, she sees the divine beauty; but\r\nstill she does not yet quite enjoy it perfectly, because she\r\ncontemplates it in her own particular intellect only, which cannot be\r\ncapable of the vast universal beauty.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, not well content with this boon, love gives the soul a\r\ngreater felicity; for just as from the particular beauty of one body it\r\nguides her to the universal beauty of all bodies, so in the highest\r\nstage of perfection it guides her from the particular to the universal\r\nintellect. Hence the soul, kindled by the most sacred fire of true\r\ndivine love, flies to unite herself with the angelic nature, and not\r\nonly quite forsakes sense, but has no longer need of reason’s discourse;\r\nfor, changed into an angel, she understands all things intelligible, and\r\nwithout veil or cloud views the wide sea of pure divine beauty, and\r\nreceives it into herself, and enjoys that supreme felicity of which the\r\nsenses are incapable.\r\n\r\n69.—“If, then, the beauties which with these dim eyes of ours we daily\r\nsee in corruptible bodies (but which are naught but dreams and faintest\r\nshadows of beauty) seem to us so fair and gracious that they often\r\nkindle most ardent fire in us, and of such delight that we deem no\r\nfelicity able to equal that which we sometimes feel at a single glance\r\ncoming to us from a woman’s beloved eyes,—what happy wonder, what\r\nblessed awe, shall we think is that which fills the souls that attain to\r\nthe vision of divine beauty! What sweet flame, what delightful burning,\r\nmust that be thought which springs from the fountain of supreme and true\r\nbeauty!—which is the source of every other beauty, which never waxes nor\r\nwanes: ever fair, and of its own self most simple in every part alike;\r\nlike only to itself, and partaking of none other; but fair in such wise\r\nthat all other fair things are fair because they derive their beauty\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n“This is that beauty identical with highest good, which by its light\r\ncalls and attracts all things to itself, and not only gives intellect to\r\nthe intellectual, reason to the rational, sense and desire for life to\r\nthe sensual, but to plants also and to stones communicates motion and\r\nthat natural instinct of their quality, as an imprint of itself.\r\n\r\n“Therefore this love is as much greater and happier than the others, as\r\nthe cause that moves it is more excellent; and hence, just as material\r\nfire refines gold, so does this most sacred fire in our souls destroy\r\nand consume that which is mortal there, and quickens and beautifies that\r\ncelestial part which at first, by reason of the senses, was dead and\r\nburied in them. This is the Pyre whereon the poets write that Hercules\r\nwas burned on the crest of Mount Œta, and by such burning became divine\r\nand immortal after death.[478] This is the Burning Bush of Moses, the\r\nCloven Tongues of fire, the Fiery Chariot of Elias,[479] which doubles\r\ngrace and felicity in the souls of those who are worthy to behold it,\r\nwhen they leave this earthly baseness and take flight towards heaven.\r\n\r\n“Let us, then, direct all the thoughts and forces of our soul to this\r\nmost sacred light, which shows us the way that leads to heaven; and\r\nfollowing after it, let us lay aside the passions wherewith we were\r\nclothed at our fall, and by the stairway that bears the shadow of\r\nsensual beauty on its lowest step, let us mount to the lofty mansion\r\nwhere dwells the heavenly, lovely and true beauty, which lies hidden in\r\nthe inmost secret recesses of God, so that profane eyes cannot behold\r\nit. Here we shall find a most happy end to our desires, true rest from\r\nour toil, certain cure for our miseries, most wholesome medicine for our\r\ndiseases, safest refuge from the boisterous storms of this life’s\r\ntempestuous sea.\r\n\r\n70.—“What mortal tongue, then, O most holy Love, can praise thee\r\nworthily? Most fair, most good, most wise, thou springest from the union\r\nof beauty and goodness and divine wisdom, and abidest in that union, and\r\nby that union returnest to that union as in a circle. Sweetest bond of\r\nthe universe, joining things celestial to things terrestrial, thou with\r\nbenignant sway inclinest the supernal powers to rule the lower powers,\r\nand turning the minds of mortals to their origin, joinest them thereto.\r\nThou unitest the elements in concord, movest nature to produce—and that\r\nwhich is born, to the perpetuation of life. Thou unitest things that are\r\nseparate, givest perfection to the imperfect, likeness to the unlike,\r\nfriendship to the unfriendly, fruit to the earth, tranquillity to the\r\nsea, vital light to the heavens.\r\n\r\n“Thou art father of true pleasure, of grace, of peace, of gentleness and\r\ngood will, enemy to rustic savagery and sloth—in short, the beginning\r\nand the end of every good. And since thou delightest to inhabit the\r\nflower of beautiful bodies and beautiful souls, and thence sometimes to\r\ndisplay thyself a little to the eyes and minds of those who are worthy\r\nto behold thee, methinks that now thy abode is here among us.\r\n\r\n“Deign, then, O Lord, to hear our prayers, pour thyself upon our hearts,\r\nand with the splendour of thy most holy fire illumine our darkness and,\r\nlike a trusted guide, in this blind labyrinth show us the true path.\r\nCorrect the falseness of our senses, and after our long pursuit of\r\nvanities give us true and solid good; make us to inhale those spiritual\r\nodours that quicken the powers of the intellect, and to hear the\r\ncelestial harmony with such accord that there may no longer be room in\r\nus for any discord of passion; fill us at that inexhaustible fountain of\r\ncontent which ever delights and never satiates, and gives a taste of\r\ntrue beatitude to all who drink of its living and limpid waters; with\r\nthe beams of thy light purge our eyes of misty ignorance, to the end\r\nthat they may no longer prize mortal beauty, and may know that the\r\nthings which first they seemed to see, are not, and that those which\r\nthey saw not, really are.\r\n\r\n“Accept our souls, which are offered thee in sacrifice; burn them in\r\nthat living flame which consumes all mortal dross, to the end that,\r\nbeing wholly separated from the body, they may unite with divine beauty\r\nby a perpetual and very sweet bond, and that we, being severed from\r\nourselves, may, like true lovers, be able to transform ourselves into\r\nthe beloved, and rising above the earth may be admitted to the angels’\r\nfeast, where, fed on ambrosia and immortal nectar, we may at last die a\r\nmost happy and living death, as died of old those ancient fathers whose\r\nsouls thou, by the most glowing power of contemplation, didst ravish\r\nfrom the body and unite with God.”\r\n\r\n71.—Having thus far spoken, with such vehemence that he almost seemed\r\ntransported and beside himself, Bembo remained silent and motionless,\r\nkeeping his eyes towards heaven, as if wrapped in ecstasy; when my lady\r\nEmilia, who with the others had been listening most attentively to his\r\ndiscourse, took him by the border of his robe, and shaking him a little,\r\nsaid:[480]\r\n\r\n“Have a care, messer Pietro, that with these thoughts your soul, also,\r\ndoes not forsake your body.”\r\n\r\n“My Lady,” replied messer Pietro, “that would not be the first miracle\r\nthat love has wrought upon me.”\r\n\r\nThen my lady Duchess and all the others again began urging Bembo to\r\ncontinue his discourse: and everyone seemed almost to feel in his mind a\r\nspark of that divine love which inspired the speaker, and all desired to\r\nhear more; but Bembo added:\r\n\r\n“My Lords, I have said that which love’s sacred phrensy dictated to me\r\nat the moment; now that it seems to inspire me no further, I should not\r\nknow what to say: and I think love is not willing that its secrets\r\nshould be further disclosed, or that the Courtier should pass beyond\r\nthat stage which it has been pleased to have me show him; and therefore\r\nperhaps it is not permitted to speak more of this matter.”\r\n\r\n72.—“Verily,” said my lady Duchess, “if the unyouthful Courtier should\r\nprove able to follow the path that you have shown him, he ought in all\r\nreason to content himself with such great felicity, and to have no envy\r\nof the youthful Courtier.”\r\n\r\nThen messer Cesare Gonzaga said:\r\n\r\n“The road which leads to this felicity seems to me so steep that I\r\nbelieve it is very hard to travel.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar added:\r\n\r\n“I believe it is hard for men to travel, but impossible for women.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“My lord Gaspar, if you return to wronging us so often, I promise you\r\nthat you will not be pardoned again.”\r\n\r\nMy lord Gaspar replied:\r\n\r\n“No wrong is done you by saying that women’s souls are not so purged of\r\npassion as those of men, nor given to contemplation, as messer Pietro\r\nsaid those must be who would taste divine love. Thus we do not read that\r\nany woman has had this grace, but that many men have had it, like Plato,\r\nSocrates and Plotinus,[481] and many others; and so many of our holy\r\nFathers, like St. Francis, upon whom an ardent spirit of love impressed\r\nthe most holy seal of the five wounds:[482] nor could aught but the\r\npower of love lift St. Paul to the vision of those mysteries whereof man\r\nis not allowed to speak;[483] nor show St. Stephen the opened\r\nheavens.”[484]\r\n\r\nHere the Magnifico Giuliano replied:\r\n\r\n“In this, women will by no means be outdone by men; for Socrates himself\r\nconfesses that all the mysteries of love which he knew were revealed to\r\nhim by a woman, who was the famous Diotima;[362] and the angel who\r\nwounded St. Francis with the fire of love, has also made several women\r\nof our age worthy of the same seal. You must remember, too, that St.\r\nMary Magdalen had many sins forgiven her because she loved much,[485]\r\nand perhaps with no less grace than St. Paul was she many times lifted\r\nto the third heaven by angelic love; and so many others, who (as I\r\nnarrated yesterday more at large) for the love of Christ’s name took no\r\nheed of life, nor were afraid of torments or any manner of death however\r\nhorrible and cruel it might be; and they were not old, as messer Pietro\r\nwould have our Courtier, but tender and delicate girls, and of that age\r\nwherein he says that sensual love ought to be allowed in men.”\r\n\r\n73.—My lord Gaspar began making ready to reply, but my lady Duchess\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Of this let messer Pietro Bembo be the judge, and let us abide by his\r\ndecision whether or not women are as capable of divine love as men are.\r\nBut as the controversy between you might be too long, it will be well to\r\npostpone it until to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, until this evening,” said messer Cesare Gonzaga.\r\n\r\n“How until this evening?” said my lady Duchess.\r\n\r\nMesser Cesare replied:\r\n\r\n“Because it is already day;” and he showed her the light that was\r\nbeginning to come in through the cracks at the windows.\r\n\r\nThen everyone rose to his feet in great surprise, for the discussion did\r\nnot seem to have lasted longer than usual; but by reason of having been\r\nbegun much later, and by its pleasantness, it had so beguiled the\r\ncompany that they had not perceived the flight of hours; nor was there\r\nanyone who felt the heaviness of sleep upon his eyes, which nearly\r\nalways happens when the accustomed hour of sleep is passed in watching.\r\nThe windows having then been opened on that side of the palace which\r\nlooks towards the lofty crest of Mount Catria,[486] they saw that a\r\nbeautiful dawn of rosy hue was already born in the east, and that all\r\nthe stars had vanished save Venus, sweet mistress of the sky, who holds\r\nthe bonds of night and day; from which there seemed to breathe a gentle\r\nwind that filled the air with crisp coolness and began to waken sweet\r\nchoruses of joyous birds in the murmuring forests of the hills hard by.\r\n\r\nSo, having reverently taken leave of my lady Duchess, they all started\r\ntowards their chambers without light of torches, that of day being\r\nenough for them; and as they were about to quit the room, my lord\r\nPrefect turned to my lady Duchess, and said:\r\n\r\n“My Lady, to finish the controversy between my lord Gaspar and my lord\r\nMagnifico, we will come with our judge this evening earlier than we did\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\nMy lady Emilia replied:\r\n\r\n“On condition that if my lord Gaspar wishes to accuse women and put some\r\nfresh imputation upon them, as is his wont, he shall also give bond to\r\nsustain his charge, for I account him a shifty disputant.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          VXORI DILECTISSIMAE\r\n\r\n                            OPERIS ADIVTRICI\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE\r\n  COUNT OF NOVILLARA\r\n  1478-1529\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Anderson’s photograph (no.2955) of the anonymous portrait\r\n    in the Corsini Gallery at Rome. This may possibly be a copy of a\r\n    second portrait that Raphael is said to have painted of Castiglione,\r\n    in 1519.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PRELIMINARY NOTES\r\n\r\nBaldesar Castiglione was born on his father’s estate of Casatico in the\r\nMantuan territory, 6 December 1478. Michelangelo was his senior by four\r\nyears; Leo X by three years; Titian by one year; Giorgione and Cesare\r\nBorgia were born in the year of his birth, while his friend Raphael and\r\nalso Luther were his juniors by five years.\r\n\r\nHis surname is said to be derived from the little town at which\r\nBonaparte defeated the Austrians near Mantua in 1796, and which is by\r\nsome supposed to have taken its name from _Castrum Stiliconis_, Camp of\r\nStilico, a Roman general of the 4th century. One Tealdo Castiglione was\r\nArchbishop of Milan as early as 1074, from which time the family is\r\noften and honourably mentioned in the annals of northern Italy.\r\n\r\nBaldesar’s parents were Count Cristoforo Castiglione, a\r\nsoldier-courtier, and Luigia Gonzaga, a near kinswoman of the Marquess\r\nof Mantua. The boy studied at Milan,—learning Latin from Giorgio Merula\r\nand Greek from Demetrios Chalcondylas, an erudite Athenian who had fled\r\nfrom Byzantium about 1447, and of whom another pupil wrote: “It seems to\r\nme that in him are figured all the wisdom, the civility and the elegance\r\nof those ancients who are so famous and so illustrious. Merely seeing\r\nhim, you fancy you are looking on Plato; far more when you hear him\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\nHaving spent some time at the splendid court of Ludovico Sforza at\r\nMilan, Castiglione lost his father in 1499, and (the Sforzas being\r\nexpelled the same year) he returned to Mantua and entered the service of\r\nhis natural lord, the Marquess Gianfrancesco Gonzaga; he accompanied\r\nthis prince to Milan to witness the entry of Louis XII of France, and\r\nafterwards on an expedition to aid the French in their vain effort to\r\nhold the kingdom of Naples against the Aragonese. When Gonzaga abandoned\r\nthe French cause (after being defeated by Ferdinand the Catholic’s\r\n“Great Captain,” Consalvo de Cordova, near the Garigliano in 1503),\r\nCastiglione obtained leave to go to Rome, and there met Duke Guidobaldo\r\ndi Montefeltro, who had come to pay homage to the newly elected Pope\r\nJulius II. He entered the duke’s service, and soon became one of the\r\nbrightest ornaments of that brilliant company of statesmen, prelates,\r\nscholars, poets, wits and ladies, known as the Court of Urbino.\r\n\r\nIn 1504 he took part, under Duke Guidobaldo, in the papal siege of\r\nCesena against the Venetians. The next year he attended the duke on a\r\ndiplomatic visit to Rome. In 1506 he was sent to the court of Henry VII\r\nof England to receive the insignia of the Order of the Garter on the\r\nduke’s behalf. As appears from a letter to his mother, he returned to\r\nUrbino as early as 5 March 1507, notwithstanding his mention of himself\r\nin The Courtier as still absent in England at the date (8-11 March) of\r\nthe dialogues he professes to report at second hand. In the same year he\r\nwas sent on a mission to Louis XII at Milan.\r\n\r\nOn Guidobaldo’s death in 1508, Castiglione continued in the service of\r\nthe new duke, Francesco Maria della Rovere (“my lord Prefect” of THE\r\nCOURTIER), who appointed him governor of Gubbio. In the following year\r\nhe served in his master’s campaign against the Venetians, and contracted\r\na dangerous illness, during which he was tenderly nursed by the dowager\r\nduchess, Elisabetta Gonzaga. In 1511 he accompanied the duke to Rome on\r\nthe occasion of the latter’s trial for the murder of Cardinal Alidosi,\r\nand was active in Francesco Maria’s successful defence. In 1513 the duke\r\ncreated him Count of Novillara and gave him an estate of that name,\r\nwhich however he soon lost through the Medici usurpation of the duchy,\r\nand never regained. At the death of Julius II, Castiglione was\r\nambassador to the sacred college, and continued in that office during\r\nnearly the whole of Leo X's pontificate. His numerous letters show the\r\nvariety and importance of the diplomatic business in which he was\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nSeveral plans for his marriage came to nothing, and on one occasion,\r\nwhen the lady’s father hesitated, the suitor broke off negotiations,\r\nsaying: “The wife that I am to take, be she who she may, I desire that\r\nshe should be given to me with as good will as I take her withal,—yea,\r\nif she were the daughter of a king.”\r\n\r\nPope Leo having in 1516 basely deprived Francesco Maria of the Duchy of\r\nUrbino, Castiglione accepted an invitation to Mantua and there married\r\nIppolita, daughter of Count Guido Torello di Montechiarugolo and\r\nFrancesca Bentivoglio, a daughter of the former ruler of Bologna. This\r\nunion proved exceptionally happy and was blessed by three children: a\r\nson Camillo, a daughter Anna, and a second daughter Ippolita, at whose\r\nbirth the young mother lost her life in 1520. His son attained the age\r\nof eighty years, and is said to have been the true embodiment of the\r\nqualities described in THE COURTIER.\r\n\r\nCastiglione resided alternately at Mantua and at Rome, where he served\r\nas Mantuan ambassador, and where his learning, wit, taste, gentle\r\ndisposition and integrity earned for him an almost unique eminence at\r\nthe papal court.\r\n\r\nIn 1524 he was sent by Pope Clement VII as ambassador to the Emperor\r\nCharles V (who was waging war against the French in Italy), but while\r\nhis counsel and high qualities were appreciated, he was too honest a man\r\nto cope with the tortuous politics of the time, and proved unable to\r\navert the capture and sack of Rome (1527) or the imprisonment of the\r\npope. These catastrophes, together with a malicious and easily disproved\r\ncharge of treason brought against him, preyed upon his health, and\r\ndespite the many honours conferred upon him by Charles, he failed to\r\nrally, and finally died at Toledo, 7 February 1529, without again seeing\r\nhis native land. His body was afterwards brought to Italy and buried in\r\nthe church of the Madonna delle Grazie near Mantua, where his tomb was\r\nerected from designs by his young friend Giulio Romano.\r\n\r\nBesides THE COURTIER, his writings comprise: _Tirsi_, an eclogue of\r\nfifty-five stanzas in _ottava rima_, written and recited at the court of\r\nUrbino for the carnival of 1506; a prologue and epilogue for his friend\r\nBibbiena’s _Calandra_; a few Italian lyrics of moderate merit; and some\r\nbetter Latin elegies and epigrams; nearly all composed during his\r\nembassy at Rome. A large number of his letters also have been preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CASTIGLIONE'S TOMB\r\n  CHURCH OF THE MADONNA DELLE GRAZIE NEAR MANTUA\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from a water-colour drawing made by the architect Patricolo and\r\n    the painter Zanetti from the monument designed by Giulio Pippi,\r\n    better known as Giulio Romano, (1492-1546). The water-mark of the\r\n    paper on which this volume is printed is copied from a drawing, by\r\n    Zanetti, of Castiglione’s arms as they appear in the upper left-hand\r\n    panel of the monument.\r\n\r\nHis fine character is reflected in that of his Courtier, who (as Symonds\r\nsays) “is, with one or two points of immaterial difference, a modern\r\ngentleman, such as all men of education at the present day would wish to\r\nbe.” It may perhaps aid the reader to realize the time in which the\r\nauthor lived, to recall that when Castiglione was born, printing had\r\nbeen practised in Italy for thirteen years, that the earliest Greek\r\ngrammar had been printed two years, that America was discovered when he\r\nwas a boy, that the Reformation began when he was in the prime of life,\r\nand that the Lutherans were first called Protestants in the year of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe first (Aldine) edition of THE COURTIER was issued thirteen years\r\nafter the death of Teob_aldo_ Manucci, the illustrious founder of the\r\npress that continued to bear his name, and consisted of one thousand and\r\nthirty-one copies, of which thirty were on large paper and one on\r\nvellum. It is a small folio of one hundred and twenty-two leaves, the\r\ntype-page measuring almost precisely nine and one-quarter inches by five\r\nand one-eighth inches. In its ordinary form the book can hardly be\r\ncalled rare, as in 1895 the present translator secured a good copy from\r\nLeipsic for forty-five francs.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Spanish translator, BOSCAN, (born at Barcelona about 1493;\r\ndied in France about 1542), was of gentle birth. Early becoming a\r\nsoldier, he served with credit in Charles V's Italian campaigns, and\r\nthus acquired familiarity with the language and literature of Italy. He\r\nis said to have known Castiglione personally. Having been for some time\r\ntutor to the young prince who was later known as the Duke of Alva, he\r\nmarried and devoted the rest of his short life to letters. As a writer\r\nhe is best known as the founder of the Italian poetical school in Spain.\r\nTicknor says that Boscan’s version of THE COURTIER hardly professes to\r\nbe literal, but that perhaps nothing in Castilian prose of an earlier\r\ndate is written in so classical and finished a style. It has been often\r\nreprinted (as recently as 1873), and was found useful by the present\r\ntranslator in doubtful passages.\r\n\r\nThe earliest French translator, COLIN, (died 1547), was a native of\r\nAuxerre and enjoyed the favour of Francis I, whom he served as reader\r\nand almoner, and who bestowed upon him the abbotship of St. Ambrose at\r\nTours, as well as other ecclesiastical offices. In his prosperity he\r\nshowed much kindness to his less fortunate brother authors, but he was\r\ntoo free of speech to be permanently successful as a courtier, and lost\r\nhis preferments. His translation of THE COURTIER, which some writers\r\nerroneously ascribe to Jean Chaperon, is little esteemed, was soon\r\nissued with corrections by another hand, and then followed by another\r\nFrench version. He translated also parts of Homer and Ovid, and composed\r\noriginal verse in Latin and French. For an account of Castiglione’s\r\ninfluence upon French literature and of his many French imitators,\r\nconsult Pietro Toldo’s “Le Courtisan dans la littérature française et\r\nses rapports avec l'œuvre du Castiglione,” (Archiv für das Studium der\r\nNeueren Sprachen und Litteraturen, C. iv, pp. 75 and 313, and C. v, p.\r\n60).\r\n\r\nThe earliest English translator, HOBY, (born 1530; died 1566), was the\r\nson of William and Katherine (Forden) Hoby of Herefordshire. Having\r\nstudied at Cambridge, he visited France, Italy and other foreign\r\ncountries. In 1565-6 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth and sent as\r\nambassador to France, where he soon died, leaving several children and a\r\nwidow. This lady was the third of Sir Anthony Cooke’s five learned\r\ndaughters, of whom the eldest married Sir William Cecil (afterwards Lord\r\nBurleigh), while the second became the mother of Francis Bacon, Lord\r\nVerulam. Interesting details of Hoby’s life and of the manners of the\r\ntime are given in his unpublished diary, preserved in the British\r\nMuseum. His version of THE COURTIER was carefully made, and although\r\nrough to our ears and occasionally obscure, it became very popular and\r\nwas several times republished. A beautiful reprint of the original\r\nedition has recently been issued (1900), in a scholarly introduction to\r\nwhich Professor Walter Raleigh traces the influence of the book upon\r\nElizabethan writers. THE COURTIER, and especially Hoby’s translation of\r\nit, are the subject of a very interesting study by Mary Augusta Scott,\r\nPh.D., printed in the Publications of the Modern Language Association of\r\nAmerica, vol. xvi (1901), no. 4. In 1570 Roger Ascham wrote in his\r\n“Schoolmaster:” “To join learning with comely exercises, Count Baldesar\r\nCastiglione in his book CORTEGIANO doth trimly teach: which book,\r\nadvisedly read and diligently followed but one year at home in England,\r\nwould do a young gentleman more good, I wis, than three years’ travel\r\nabroad in Italy. And I marvel this book is not more read in the Court\r\nthan it is, seeing it is so well translated into English by a worthy\r\ngentleman, Sir Thomas Hobbie, who was many ways well furnished with\r\nlearning, and very expert in knowledge of divers tongues.”\r\n\r\nOf the first German translator, LORENZ KRATZER, little more is known\r\nthan that he was an officer of customs at Burckhausen, in Bavaria, from\r\n1565 to 1588, and that he speaks of having devoted to letters the ample\r\nleisure which his duties permitted. Although said to be meritorious, his\r\nwork can hardly have gained wide currency, as both Noyse (whose German\r\ntranslation of THE COURTIER was published at Dilingen in 1593) and a\r\nthird German translator (whose version was issued at Frankfort in 1684\r\nunder the initials “J. C. L. L. J.”) seem to have regarded themselves\r\neach as the earliest in the field.\r\n\r\nThe first Latin translator, TURLER, (born 1550; died 1602), was a\r\n_Doctor Juris_, and became burgomaster of his native town of Lössnitz,\r\nnear Leipsic. Besides THE COURTIER, he translated several of\r\nMachiavelli’s works into Latin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     NOTES TO THE DEDICATORY LETTER\r\n\r\nNote 1 page 1. Dom MIGUEL DE SILVA, (born about 1490; died 1556), was\r\nthe second son of Diego de Silva and Maria de Ayola, Count and Countess\r\nof Portalegre, a province of central Portugal. Having studied at the\r\nuniversities of Paris, Siena and Bologna, he was soon called to the\r\ncourt of Emanuel of Portugal, held various ecclesiastical posts, and was\r\nmade Bishop of Viseu in the Province of Beira. As ambassador to Popes\r\nLeo X, Adrian VI and Clement VII, he paid long visits to Rome, where his\r\nfriendship with Castiglione probably began. During the twenty years that\r\nfollowed 1521 he served John III of Portugal as _Escribano de la\r\nPuridad_; then, having been made a cardinal by Paul III, he spent the\r\nremainder of his life in the papal service, died in Rome, and was buried\r\nin the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Eminent as a prelate and a\r\ndiplomatist, he also enjoyed no small repute as an author and an elegant\r\nLatinist.\r\n\r\nNote 2 page 1. GUIDOBALDO DI MONTEFELTRO, Duke of Urbino, (born 1472;\r\ndied 1508), was the only son of Duke Federico di Montefeltro and\r\nBattista Sforza, an accomplished niece of the first Sforza duke of\r\nMilan. Precocious as a child, he was elaborately yet judiciously\r\neducated, and much of the praise bestowed upon him in THE COURTIER is\r\nshown by contemporary evidence to have been just. On his father’s death\r\nin 1482, both he and his State were confided to his cousin Ubaldini (see\r\nnote 273), who seems to have been loyal to the trust, although next heir\r\nto the duchy. From records that have survived, Dennistoun extracts some\r\ndetails of the young duke’s court: “To all persons composing the ducal\r\nhousehold, unexceptionable manners were indispensable. In those of\r\nhigher rank there were further required competent talents and learning,\r\na grave deportment, and fluency of speech. The servants must be of\r\nsteady habits and respectable character; regular in all private\r\ntransactions; of good address, modest and graceful; willing and neat\r\nhanded in their service. There is likewise inculcated the most\r\nscrupulous personal cleanliness, especially of the hands, with\r\nparticular injunctions as to frequent ablutions, and extraordinary\r\nprecautions against the unpleasant effects of hot weather on their\r\npersons and clothing; in case of need, medical treatment is enjoined to\r\ncorrect the breath. Those who wore livery had two suits a year,\r\ngenerally of fustian, though to some silk doublets were given for summer\r\nuse.”\r\n\r\nIn 1489 Guidobaldo married Elisabetta Gonzaga, a sister of the Marquess\r\nof Mantua. All hopes, however, of an heir were soon abandoned,\r\napparently owing to the young duke’s physical infirmities, which were\r\nincreased by over exercise and in time unfitted him for all active\r\noccupations. Nevertheless he was able to take part in the vain\r\nresistance to Charles VIII's invasion of Italy, and later in the\r\nexpulsion of the French from the kingdom of Naples. While fighting in\r\nthe service of Pope Alexander VI in 1497, he was taken prisoner and\r\nforced to pay a ransom of 30,000 ducats, a sum then equivalent to about\r\ntwice that number of modern pounds sterling, and raised only at the\r\nsacrifice of his duchess’s jewels. In 1501 he aided rather than opposed\r\nLouis XII's invasion of Naples.\r\n\r\nIn 1502 the pope’s son Cesare Borgia treacherously seized the Duchy of\r\nUrbino. To spare his people bloodshed and ruin, Guidobaldo fled in\r\ndisguise to his brother-in-law at Mantua, and after a vain appeal to\r\nLouis XII, found an honourable asylum at Venice. In the same year he\r\nregained his dominions for a short time, but was again forced to take\r\nflight. On the death of Alexander VI (August 1503), Cesare’s power\r\ncrumbled, Guidobaldo easily recovered his duchy, and his position was\r\nsoon assured by the election of Julius II, who was not only his personal\r\nfriend, but also the brother of his sister Giovanna’s husband. In 1504\r\nhe formally adopted as his heir this sister’s son, Francesco Maria della\r\nRovere, and (as we have seen) took into his service the future author of\r\nTHE COURTIER. His learning, amiability and munificence attracted choice\r\nspirits to his court, which came to be regarded as the first in Italy.\r\nPope Julius was splendidly entertained there on his way both to and from\r\nhis Bologna campaign, and the Courtier dialogues are represented as\r\ntaking place immediately after his departure for Rome in March 1507.\r\n\r\nLong an invalid, Guidobaldo became more and more a martyr to his gout,\r\nwhich was aggravated by a season of exceptional drought and cold and\r\nbrought him final relief from suffering in April 1508. His fame rests,\r\nnot upon his military and political achievements, but upon the beauty of\r\nhis character, the variety of his intellectual accomplishments, the\r\npatience with which he endured reverses, illness and forced inaction,\r\nand upon the culture and refinement that characterized his court.\r\n\r\nNote 3 page 1. FRANCESCO MARIA DELLA ROVERE, Duke of Urbino, (born 1490;\r\ndied 1538), was the son of Giovanni della Rovere and Duke Guidobaldo’s\r\nsister Giovanna di Montefeltro. Giovanni was a nephew of Pope Sixtus IV\r\n(who had made him Prefect of Rome), and a younger brother of Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, afterwards Pope Julius II.\r\n\r\nOn his father’s death in 1501, Francesco was brought to the court of his\r\nuncle Guidobaldo, who secured for him a renewal of the Prefecture and\r\nsuperintended his education. In THE COURTIER he appears as “my lord\r\nPrefect.” During the Borgian usurpation of the duchy, he found refuge at\r\nthe court of Louis XII; and soon after the fall of the Borgias and his\r\nuncle Julius II's accession, he was adopted as Guidobaldo’s heir, while\r\nthrough the mediation of Castiglione a marriage was arranged for him\r\nwith Eleanora, daughter to the Marquess of Mantua and niece to the\r\nDuchess of Urbino. He now resided chiefly with his uncle, acquainting\r\nhimself with his future subjects and duties. Although he possessed many\r\nof the good qualities ascribed to him in THE COURTIER, his temper was\r\nungovernable, and before reaching the age of eighteen he slew one of the\r\nmembers of the court, who was accused of seducing his sister.\r\n\r\nHaving become duke in 1508, he was married on Christmas Eve of that\r\nyear. In the following spring he commanded the papal forces in the\r\nLeague of Cambray, and despite the obstacles put in his way by his\r\ncolleague Cardinal Alidosi (see note 268), he soon reduced the Romagna\r\ntowns, the recovery of which from Venice was Julius II's chief object in\r\nforming the league. In a later campaign against the French, Bologna was\r\nlost to the Church (1511) through the treachery of Alidosi, who craftily\r\ncontrived to have the blame fall upon Francesco, and was murdered by the\r\nlatter at Ravenna. After a long trial before six cardinals, in which\r\nample proof of the dead man’s treason was presented, and an eloquent\r\nappeal made by Beroaldo (see note 235),—the young duke was acquitted and\r\nrestored to the pope’s favour.\r\n\r\nAlthough both Francesco and his predecessor had generously befriended\r\nthe Medici during their exile from Florence (1494-1512), Leo X (Giovanni\r\nde' Medici) seized his duchy in 1516, to bestow it on a nephew, Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici. It is needless to speak here of Francesco’s restoration in\r\n1521, of his failure to relieve Pope Clement VII when Rome was sacked in\r\n1527, or of his later life.\r\n\r\nWhile small in person, Francesco was active and well formed. His manners\r\nwere gentle and his character forgiving, in spite of his fiery temper.\r\nStrict in religious observances and an enemy to blasphemous language, he\r\nwas also creditably intolerant of those outrages upon womanly honour\r\nwith which war was then fraught. He was famous chiefly as a soldier, and\r\nby so competent a judge as the Emperor Charles V was regarded as master\r\nof the military science of his day.\r\n\r\nNote 4 page 1. This disclaimer of careful authorship is not to be taken\r\ntoo literally. At least a draft of Books I-III seems to have been made\r\nat Urbino between April 1508 and May 1509, while Book IV was probably\r\nwritten at Rome in the earlier part of the interval between September\r\n1513 and March 1516. Castiglione apparently continued to revise his work\r\nuntil 1518, when he sent his MS. to Bembo. See Silvestro Marcello’s\r\npamphlet, “La Cronologia del Cortegiano di Baldesar Castiglione.” Pisa,\r\n1895.\r\n\r\nNote 5 page 1. As has been seen, Castiglione resided at the Spanish\r\ncourt from 1524 until his death in 1529.\r\n\r\nNote 6 page 1. VITTORIA COLONNA, (born 1490; died 1547), was the\r\ndaughter of Fabrizio Colonna (grand-nephew of Pope Martin V) and Agnese\r\ndi Montefeltro, a sister of Duke Guidobaldo. At the age of four she was\r\nbetrothed to the Marquess of Pescara, whom she married in her nineteenth\r\nyear at Ischia (the fief and residence of his family), and who\r\nafterwards became a famous soldier. During his long absences in the\r\nfield, she consoled herself with books, and after his death in 1525, her\r\nwidowhood was spent in retirement and finally in semi-monastic seclusion\r\nat Rome. The time spared from pious exercises she devoted to study, the\r\ncomposition of poetry, correspondence with illustrious men of letters,\r\nand the society of learned persons. Although she never became a convert\r\nto Protestantism, the liberality of some of her friends’ belief exposed\r\nher to ecclesiastical censure in her old age. Her celebrated friendship\r\nwith Michelangelo began when he was past sixty and she had nearly\r\nreached fifty years. They frequently exchanged verses, and he is said to\r\nhave visited her on her death-bed. Her poems are chiefly sonnets to the\r\nmemory of her husband or verses on sacred and moral subjects.\r\n\r\nNote 7 page 7. The following passage is from a letter written by\r\nCastiglione to the Marchioness: “I am the more deeply obliged to your\r\nLadyship, because the necessity you have put me under, of sending the\r\nbook at once to the printer, relieves me from the trouble of adding many\r\nthings that I had already prepared in my mind,—things (I need hardly\r\nsay) of little import, like the rest of the book; so that your Ladyship\r\nhas saved the reader from tedium, and the author from blame.”\r\n\r\nDespite the many decrees of popes, emperors and other potentates,\r\nliterary piracy seems to have been quite as common in Castiglione’s time\r\nas in ours. He was obviously none too prompt in his precautions, as an\r\napparently unauthorized edition of THE COURTIER was issued at Florence\r\nby the heirs of Filippo di Giunta in the October following its first\r\npublication at Venice in April 1528.\r\n\r\nNote 8 page 8. ALFONSO ARIOSTO, (died 1526), was a cousin of the poet\r\nLudovico. Little more seems to be known of him than that his father’s\r\nname was Bonifazio, that he was a gentle cavalier and brave soldier in\r\nthe service of the Este family, and that he was a friend of Castiglione\r\nand of Bembo. His name appears at the head of each of the four dialogues\r\ncomposing THE COURTIER, and they purport to have been written at his\r\nsuggestion. Señor A. M. Fabié, in his notes to the 1873 reprint of\r\nBoscan’s translation, affirms that Alfonso Ariosto had nothing to do\r\nwith the poet Ludovico, belonged to a noble Bolognese family, and\r\nenjoyed much favour at the court of Francis I of France.\r\n\r\nNote 9 page 9. GIULIANO DE' MEDICI, (born 1478; died 1516), was the\r\nthird son of Lorenzo the Magnificent and Clarice Orsini. His education\r\nseems to have been for a time entrusted to the famous scholar-poet\r\nPoliziano (see note 105). During his family’s exile from Florence\r\n(1494-1512), he resided much at the court of Urbino, where he was known\r\nas “the Magnifico Giuliano,” and where one wing of the great palace was\r\nreserved to his use and is still called by his name. He became the\r\nfather of a boy afterwards known as Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici,—the\r\noriginal of Titian’s fine portrait in the Pitti Gallery. On the\r\nrestoration of the Medici, Giuliano was placed at the head of affairs in\r\nhis native city and succeeded in winning the good will of the\r\nFlorentines, but his gentle disposition and love of ease thwarted other\r\nambitious projects formed for his advancement by his brother Leo X, and\r\nhe was too grateful to the dukes of Urbino for their hospitality to\r\naccept the pope’s intended appropriation of their duchy for his benefit.\r\nIn 1515 he married Filiberta of Savoy and was created Duke of Nemours by\r\nher nephew Francis I of France. In the same year he was appointed\r\nCaptain General of the Church, but failing health prevented his actual\r\nservice, and he soon died of fever at Florence, not without suspicion of\r\npoison at the hands of his nephew Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nSeveral of his sonnets have survived, and are said to show no mean\r\npoetic faculty. Apart, however, from his appearance as an interlocutor\r\nin THE COURTIER and in Bembo’s _Prose_, his memory is best preserved by\r\nMichelangelo’s famous tomb at Florence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VITTORIA COLONNA\r\n  MARCHIONESS OF PESCARA\r\n  1490-1547\r\n]\r\n\r\nMuch enlarged from a cast, kindly furnished by M. Pierre Valton, of an\r\n    anonymous medal in his collection at Paris.\r\n\r\nNote 10 page 2. “MESSER BERNARDO” (DOVIZI), better known by the name of\r\nhis birthplace BIBBIENA, (born 1470; died 1520), was of humble\r\nparentage. His elder brother Pietro was secretary to Lorenzo de' Medici,\r\nand secured his admission to the Magnifico’s household, where he shared\r\nthe education of the young Giovanni and became a devoted friend of that\r\nfuture pope. Following the Medici into exile, he travelled about Europe\r\nwith Giovanni and attended Giuliano to Urbino, where he received the\r\nwarm welcome always accorded there to such as combined learning with\r\ncourtly manners. By the Duke of Urbino he seems to have been so\r\ncommended to the favour of Julius II, that he was able to aid\r\nMichelangelo in securing part payment for the Sistine Chapel frescoes,\r\nof which payment, however, he accepted five per cent. as a gift from the\r\npainter. At the death of Julius, he was secretary to his friend Cardinal\r\nGiovanni de' Medici, and in that capacity had access to the conclave,\r\nwhere his adroitness was largely helpful in effecting his patron’s\r\nelection as pope. Leo at once made him Cardinal of Santa Maria in\r\nPortico and loaded him with lucrative offices. During the Medicean\r\nusurpation of the Duchy of Urbino, he showed no gratitude for the\r\nkindness enjoyed by him at that court. He became very rich, and was a\r\nliberal patron of authors and artists. Raphael devised to him the house\r\nof the architect Bramante, which the painter had bought for a sum\r\nequivalent to about £6,000, and which was afterwards demolished in\r\nextending the piazza in front of St. Peter’s.\r\n\r\nBesides a large number of his letters, for the most part unpublished, we\r\nhave his play, _Calandra_, founded upon the _Menæchmi_ of Plautus and\r\nonce esteemed as the earliest Italian prose comedy.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was bald, and although his friend Raphael’s portrait hardly\r\njustifies the epithet, he was known as the “_Bel Bernardo_.” A\r\ncontemporary MS. in the Vatican describes him as “a facetious character,\r\nwith no mean powers of ridicule, and much tact in promoting jocular\r\nconversation by his wit and well-timed jests. He was a great favourite\r\nwith certain cardinals, whose chief pursuit was pleasure and the chase,\r\nfor he thoroughly knew all their habits and fancies, and was even aware\r\nof whatever vicious propensities they had. He likewise possessed a\r\nsingular pliancy for flattery, and for obsequiously accommodating\r\nhimself to their whims, stooping patiently to be the butt of insulting\r\nand abusive jokes, and shrinking from nothing that could render him\r\nacceptable to them. He also had much readiness in council, and was\r\nperfectly able seasonably to qualify his wit with wisdom, or to\r\ndissemble with singular cunning.” On the other hand, Bembo wrote of him\r\nto their friend Federico Fregoso: “The days seem years until I see him,\r\nand enjoy the pleasing society, the charming conversation, the wit, the\r\njests, the features and the affection of that man.”\r\n\r\nNote 11 page 2. OTTAVIANO FREGOSO, (died 1524), belonged to a noble\r\nGenoese family that had long distinguished itself in public service and\r\nhad furnished several doges to the Republic. His parents were Agostino\r\nFregoso and Gentile di Montefeltro, a half-sister of Duke Guidobaldo.\r\nDriven from Genoa as early as 1497, he entered his uncle’s court at\r\nUrbino and rendered important military services, especially during the\r\nstruggle with Cesare Borgia, in which he gallantly defended the fortress\r\nof San Leo (see note 275), and was rewarded with the lordship of Santa\r\nAgata in the Apennines. In 1506 he commanded the papal forces for the\r\nrecovery of Bologna, and later in the League of Cambray against Venice.\r\nIn 1513 he succeeded in putting an end to French domination in Genoa,\r\nwas elected doge, and ruled so beneficently for two years that when\r\nFrancis I regained the city, Fregoso was continued as governor. In 1522\r\nGenoa was captured and sacked by Spanish and German troops, and Fregoso\r\ngiven over to the Marquess of Pescara, treated harshly (despite\r\nCastiglione’s intercession on his behalf), and carried to Ischia, where\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nSeveral stories of his absent-mindedness are narrated by Dennistoun, and\r\none illustrates the freedom of intercourse at the court of Urbino. His\r\nuncle Guidobaldo appearing one day in a beautiful violet satin jerkin,\r\nOttaviano exclaimed: “My lord Duke, you really are _the_ handsome\r\nSignor!” and then, on being reproved for flattery, he replied: “I did\r\nnot mean that you are a man of worth, though I pronounced you a fine man\r\nand a handsome nobleman.”\r\n\r\nNote 12 page 2. “MY LADY DUCHESS,” ELISABETTA GONZAGA, (born 1471; died\r\n1526), was the second daughter of the Marquess Federico Gonzaga of\r\nMantua and Margarita of Bavaria. She married Duke Guidobaldo in 1489. In\r\n1502 she reluctantly attended the festivities for the marriage, at\r\nFerrara, of Lucrezia Borgia to Alfonso d'Este, and some of her costumes\r\nare thus described by an eye-witness: On entering Ferrara, she rode a\r\nblack mule caparisoned in black velvet embroidered with woven gold, and\r\nwore a mantle of black velvet strewn with triangles of beaten gold, a\r\nstring of pearls about her neck, and a cap of gold; another day indoors\r\nshe wore a mantle of brown velvet slashed, and caught up with chains of\r\nmassive gold; another day a gown of black velvet striped with gold, with\r\na jewelled necklace and diadem; and still another day, a black velvet\r\nrobe embroidered with gold ciphers.\r\n\r\nDuring the Borgian usurpation of their duchy in the same year, she\r\nshared her husband’s exile at Venice, and on returning to Urbino earlier\r\nthan Guidobaldo, she amused herself with a scenic representation of the\r\nchief events that had occurred during their absence. She cared for her\r\nhusband tenderly in his illnesses, administered his government wisely\r\nwhen he was called away, and on his death acted as regent and guardian\r\nfor his nephew and successor, with whom she maintained affectionate\r\nrelations as long as she lived, and from appropriating whose dominions\r\nshe strove to the utmost to dissuade Leo X.\r\n\r\nNext to her husband’s niece by marriage, Emilia Pia (see note 37), her\r\nclosest friend seems to have been her brother’s wife, the famous\r\nIsabella d'Este (see note 397), with whom she often travelled and\r\ncontinually corresponded by letter. Although still young and accounted\r\nbeautiful at her husband’s death, she remained faithful to his memory,\r\nand the years of her widowhood were cheered by the companionship of her\r\nniece, the young duchess Eleanora of Urbino (see note 432). If we may\r\ntrust universal contemporary opinion of her virtues and beauty, the\r\nauthor of THE COURTIER flattered her as little as did the painter of her\r\nportrait in the Uffizi Gallery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEDERICO GONZAGA\r\n  MARQUESS OF MANTUA\r\n  FATHER OF “MY LADY DUCHESS”\r\n  1440-1484\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a part of Alinari’s photograph (no. 18705) of the fresco,\r\n    “The Return of the Exile,” in the _Sala degli Sposi_ of the Gonzaga\r\n    Palace at Mantua, painted not later than 1474 by Andrea Mantegna\r\n    (1431-1506). See Heinrich Thode’s monograph on Mantegna, p. 56. For\r\n    a notice of the Marquess’s life see note 263.\r\n\r\nNote 13 page 3. Vittoria Colonna seems to have had this passage in mind\r\nwhen she wrote, 20 September 1524, to Castiglione in praise of his book:\r\n“It would not be fitting for me to tell you what I think of it, for the\r\nsame reason which you say prevents you from speaking of the beauty of my\r\nlady Duchess.”\r\n\r\nNote 14 page 3. GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO, (born 1313; died 1375), was the\r\nnatural son of a Florentine tradesman and a Frenchwoman with whom his\r\nfather had made acquaintance during a business residence at Paris. In\r\nearly manhood he engaged in commerce at Naples, and had but little\r\nlearning in his youth, although he studied law for a time. Erudition and\r\nauthorship became the serious enthusiasm of his life, owing (it is said)\r\nto a chance visit to the supposed tomb of Virgil at Naples. In middle\r\nlife he began the study of Greek at his friend Petrarch’s suggestion;\r\nand although he never acquired more than what would now be deemed a\r\nsuperficial knowledge of that language, as a Hellenist he had no\r\nprecursor in Italy. An ardent if somewhat unappreciative admirer of\r\nDante (whose _Divina Commedia_ he transcribed with his own hands), he\r\nwas the first Italian author to write for the common people, instead of\r\ncomposing books suited only to the learned and patrician classes. His\r\nstyle was formed by tireless study of classic models, and became a\r\nstandard for imitation by his successors.\r\n\r\nNote 15 page 3. It is now known that the considerations that led\r\nBoccaccio to underrate his poems and tales, were ethical rather than\r\nliterary.\r\n\r\nNote 16 page 5. THEOPHRASTUS, (born 374; died 287 B.C.), was a native of\r\nLesbos, but resided at Athens. He was the chief disciple and successor\r\nof Aristotle, and wrote also upon a great variety of subjects other than\r\nphilosophy. His best known work, the “Characters,” is a collection of\r\nsprightly sketches of human types. La Bruyère’s famous book of the same\r\nname was originally a mere translation from Theophrastus. The incident\r\nmentioned in the text is thus described in Cicero’s _Brutus_: “When he\r\nasked a certain old woman for how much she would sell something, and she\r\nanswered him and added, 'Stranger, it can’t be had for less,'—he was\r\nvexed at being taken for a stranger although he had grown old at Athens\r\nand spoke to perfection.”\r\n\r\nNote 17 page 5.

In the letter quoted in note 13, Vittoria Colonna wrote:\r\n“I do not marvel at your portraying a perfect courtier well, for by\r\nmerely holding a mirrour before you and considering your inward and\r\noutward parts, you could describe him as you have; but our greatest\r\ndifficulty being to know ourselves, I say that it was more difficult for\r\nyou to portray yourself than another man.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEDERICO DI MONTEFELTRO\r\n  DUKE OF URBINO\r\n  1422-1482\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Alinari’s photograph (no. 2686) of a marble bas-relief, in\r\n    the National Museum at Florence, by some attributed to Mino da\r\n    Fiesole (1431-1484).\r\n\r\nNote 20 page 6. More than 140 editions of THE COURTIER have been\r\npublished. Most of these are mentioned in the list printed before the\r\nIndex of this volume. A few of the editions there set down differ from\r\none another only in title-page; a few others, perhaps, exist only in\r\nsome bibliographer’s erroneous mention. Deductions to be made for such\r\nreasons, however, are probably offset by other editions that the present\r\ntranslator has failed to bring to light.\r\n\r\nIn the bibliographical notes appended by the brothers Volpi to their\r\n(1733) edition, THE COURTIER is said to have been translated into\r\nFlemish; while in his preface to the Sonzogno (1890) edition, Corio\r\nspeaks of the introduction of the book into Japan in the 17th century,\r\nand also of a Russian translation by Archiuzow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                NOTES TO THE FIRST BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n\r\nNote 21 page 7. “Courtiership” is a sadly awkward rendering of the\r\nItalian _cortegiania_, which implies not only courtesy and courtliness,\r\nbut all the many other qualities and accomplishments essential to the\r\nperfect Courtier or (what in Castiglione’s time was the same) the\r\nperfect Gentleman.\r\n\r\nNote 22 page 8. The extreme dimensions of the Duchy of Urbino were 64\r\nmiles from east to west, and 60 miles from north to south. Its\r\npopulation did not much exceed 150,000.\r\n\r\nNote 23 page 8. The first of the four dialogues is represented as having\r\nbeen held on the evening of the day after the close of a certain visit\r\npaid by Pope Julius II to Urbino on his return from a successful\r\ncampaign against Bologna. This visit is known to have lasted from 3\r\nMarch to 7 March 1507. Castiglione returned from England as early as 5\r\nMarch, on which date he wrote to his mother from Urbino: “We have had\r\nhis Holiness here for two days.” It seems probable that this fictitious\r\nprolongation of his absence in England was simply a graceful excuse for\r\nnot himself appearing in the dialogues.\r\n\r\nNote 24 page 8. There were a fief and Count of Montefeltro as early as\r\n1154, and his son was made Count of Urbino in 1216, from which time\r\ntheir male descendants ruled over a gradually increased territory until\r\n1508, when the duchy passed to the female line. The name Montefeltro is\r\nsaid to have originated in that of a temple to Jupiter Feretrius, which\r\nin Roman times occupied the summit of the crag afterwards known as San\r\nLeo, in the Duchy of Urbino.\r\n\r\nNote 25 page 9. Such a rule as that of the usurping Cesare Borgia\r\n(1502-3) can hardly have been welcome to a population accustomed to the\r\nmild sway of the Montefeltro family.\r\n\r\nNote 26 page 9. “DUKE FEDERICO” DI MONTEFELTRO, (born 1422; died 1482),\r\nwas a natural son of Count Guidantonio di Montefeltro, as appears from\r\nthe act of legitimation issued by Pope Martin V and also from his\r\nfather’s testament, by virtue whereof (as well as by the choice of the\r\npeople) he succeeded his half-brother Count Oddantonio in 1444. In his\r\nboyhood he resided fifteen months as a hostage at Venice. Later he\r\nstudied the theory and practice of war at the Mantuan court, and was\r\ntrained in the humanities by the famous Vittorino da Feltre. In 1437 he\r\nmarried Gentile Brancaleone, who died childless in 1457. Nearly the\r\nwhole of his life was spent in military service, as paid ally, now of\r\none prince, now of another. In this capacity he became not only the most\r\nnoted commander of his time, but always displayed perfect and\r\nexceptional fidelity to the causes that he undertook. In 1450 he lost an\r\neye and suffered a fracture of the nose in a tournament; contemporary\r\nportraits represent his features in profile. In 1454 he began the\r\nconstruction of the great palace at Urbino. In 1460, at the suggestion\r\nof Francesco Sforza (whom he had aided to become Duke of Milan), he\r\nmarried the latter’s accomplished niece Battista Sforza, who bore him\r\nseven daughters and one son, Guidobaldo. In 1474 he was made Duke of\r\nUrbino and appointed Captain General of the Church by Pope Sixtus IV,\r\nand was unanimously elected a Knight of the Garter. He died of fever\r\ncontracted during military operations in the malarial country near\r\nFerrara. The vast sums spent by him on public buildings, art objects and\r\nbooks, and upon the maintenance of his splendid household, were not\r\nextorted from his subjects, but were received from foreign states in\r\nreturn for war service. Thus at the close of his life he drew a yearly\r\nstipend equivalent to about £330,000.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to draw a picture of his character that shall seem\r\nunflattered. Vespasiano, who by years of labour collected his famous\r\nlibrary for him, says that his “establishment was conducted with the\r\nregularity of a religious fraternity, rather than like a military\r\nhousehold. Gambling and profanity were unknown, and singular decorum of\r\nlanguage was observed, whilst many noble youths, sent there to learn\r\ngood manners and military discipline, were reared under the most\r\nexemplary tuition. He regarded his subjects as his children, and was at\r\nall times accessible to hear them personally state their petitions,\r\nbeing careful to give answers without unnecessary delay. He walked\r\nfreely about the streets, entering their shops and workrooms, and\r\nenquiring into their circumstances with paternal interest.... In summer\r\nhe was in the saddle at dawn, and rode three or four miles into the\r\ncountry with half-a-dozen of his court ... reaching home again when\r\nothers were just up. After mass, he went into an open garden and gave\r\naudience to all comers until breakfast-time. When at table, he listened\r\nto the Latin historians, chiefly Livy, except in Lent, when some\r\nreligious book was read, anyone being free to enter the hall and speak\r\nwith him then. His fare was plain and substantial, denying himself sweet\r\ndishes and wine, except drinks of pomegranates, cherries, apples, or\r\nother fruits. After dinner and supper, an able judge of appeal stated in\r\nLatin the causes brought before him, on which the duke gave judgment in\r\nthat language;... When his mid-day meal was finished, if no one appeared\r\nto ask audience, he retired to his closet and transacted private\r\nbusiness, or listened to reading until evening approached, when he\r\ngenerally walked out, giving patient ear to all who accosted him in the\r\nstreets. He then occasionally visited ... a meadow belonging to the\r\nFranciscans, where thirty or forty of the youths brought up in his court\r\nstripped their doublets, and played at throwing the bar, or at\r\nwrestling, or ball. This was a fine sight, which the duke much enjoyed,\r\nencouraging the lads, and listening freely to all until supper-time.\r\nWhen that and the audiences were over, he repaired to a private\r\napartment with his principal courtiers, whom, after some familiar talk,\r\nhe would dismiss to bed, taxing them with their sluggish indulgence of a\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ALFONSO II OF NAPLES\r\n  1448-1495\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a negative, specially made by Alinari through the courtesy\r\n    of Professor I.

In a Greek epigram written in a book borrowed from Duke\r\nGuidobaldo, Poliziano (see note 105) praises the lender as the worthy\r\nson of a father who never suffered defeat, ἀνικήτοιο πατρὸς γονόν.\r\nHistory shows that this phrase was a rhetorical exaggeration, but it\r\nbecame almost proverbial.\r\n\r\nNote 28 page 9. Although long since despoiled of its treasures, the\r\npalace is still one of the architectural monuments of Italy. Many\r\nwriters have described its magnificence,—some of the fullest accounts\r\nbeing those by Bernardino Baldi (1553-1617); Fr. Arnold (_Der\r\nHerzogliche Palast von Urbino_; Leipsic: 1857); J. A. Symonds (“Italian\r\nByways;” London: 1883; pp. 129-155); Charles Blanc (_Histoire de la\r\nRenaissance Artistique en Italie_; Paris: 1894; ii, 87-90); and Egidio\r\nCalzini (_Urbino e i Suoi Monumenti_; Florence: 1899; pp. 9-46). Baldi’s\r\ndescription will be found reprinted as an appendix to Rigutini’s (1889\r\nand 1892) editions of THE COURTIER.\r\n\r\nFor more than fourteen years Duke Federico employed from thirty to forty\r\ncopyists in transcribing Greek and Latin MSS. Not only the classics, but\r\necclesiastical and mediæval authors, as well as the Italian poets and\r\nhumanists were represented in his library, which contained 792 MSS.\r\nUltimately the collection was sent to Rome, where it forms part of the\r\nVatican Library.\r\n\r\nNote 29 page 9. Born in 1422, Duke Federico was in fact sixty years old\r\nwhen he died.\r\n\r\nNote 30 page 9. In his Latin epistle to Henry VII of England,\r\nCastiglione says that Duke Guidobaldo began to be afflicted with gout at\r\nthe age of twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nNote 31 page 10. ALFONSO II of Naples, (born 1448; died 1495), was the\r\neldest son of Ferdinand I and Isabelle de Clermont. As Duke of Calabria,\r\ncommanding the papal forces, he defeated the Florentine league in 1479,\r\nand in 1481 drove the Turks out of southern Italy. On his father’s death\r\nin 1494, he succeeded to the crown of Naples; but having rendered\r\nhimself obnoxious to his subjects, he abdicated in favour of his son\r\nFerdinand just before the arrival of Charles VIII of France, and took\r\nrefuge in a Sicilian convent, where he soon died, tortured by remorse\r\nfor the hideous cruelties that he had perpetrated. His wife was Ippolita\r\nMaria, daughter of the first Sforza duke of Milan; while his daughter\r\nIsabella’s marriage to Giangaleazzo Sforza, the rightful duke, and the\r\nusurpation of the latter’s uncle Ludovico “il Moro” (see note 302),\r\nbecame the immediate cause of the first French invasion of Italy by\r\nCharles VIII.\r\n\r\nNote 32 page 10. FERDINAND II of Naples, (born 1469; died childless\r\n1496), made a gallant but vain stand against the French, and retired to\r\nIschia with his youthful wife-aunt Joanna. When Charles VIII evacuated\r\nNaples after a stay of only fifty days, Ferdinand was soon able, with\r\nthe help of his cousin Ferdinand the Catholic’s famous general Consalvo\r\nde Cordova, to regain his dominions, but died a few weeks later. He\r\nseems to have had no lack of courage; by his mere presence he once\r\noverawed a mob at Naples, and he was beloved by the nation in spite of\r\nthe odious tyranny of his father and grandfather.\r\n\r\nNote 33 page 10. Pope ALEXANDER VI, (born 1431; died 1503), was\r\nRoderigo, the son of Giuffredo (or Alfonso) Lenzuoli and Juana (or\r\nIsabella) Borgia, a sister of Pope Calixtus III, by whom the youth was\r\nadopted and whose surname he assumed. He was elected pope in 1492\r\nthrough bribery, and while striving to increase the temporal power of\r\nthe Church, directed his chief efforts towards the establishment of a\r\ngreat hereditary dominion for his family. Of his five children, two\r\n(Cesare and Lucrezia) played important parts in his plan. In 1495 he\r\njoined the league which forced Charles VIII to retire from Italy,\r\nalthough it had been partly at his instigation that the French invaded\r\nthe peninsula. In 1498 Savonarola was burned at Florence by his orders.\r\nIn 1501 he instituted the ecclesiastical censorship of books. He is\r\nbelieved to have died from accidentally taking a poison designed by him\r\nfor a rich cardinal whose possessions he wished to seize. His private\r\nlife was disgraced by orgies, of which the details are unfit for\r\nrepetition. His contemporary Machiavelli says: “His entire occupation,\r\nhis only thought, was deception, and he always found victims. Never was\r\nthere a man with more effrontery in assertion, more ready to add oaths\r\nto his promises, or to break them.” While Sismondi terms him “the most\r\nodious, the most publicly scandalous, and the most wicked of all the\r\nmiscreants who ever misused sacred authority to outrage and degrade\r\nmankind.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FERDINAND II OF NAPLES\r\n  1469?-1496\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom Alinari’s photograph (no. 11305) of an anonymous bronze bust in the\r\n    National Museum at Naples.\r\n\r\nNote 34 page 10. Pope JULIUS II, (born 1443; died 1513), was Giuliano,\r\nthe second son of Raffaele della Rovere (only brother of Pope Sixtus IV)\r\nand Teodora Menerola. Made a cardinal soon after his uncle’s election,\r\nhe was loaded with sees and offices, including the legateship of Picene\r\nand Avignon, which latter occasioned his prolonged absence from Italy\r\nand afforded him an escape from the wiles of his inveterate enemy\r\nAlexander VI. The outrages with which Alexander sought to punish his\r\nsturdy opposition to the scandals of the Borgian court, aroused in him a\r\nfierceness of spirit that was alien to the seeming mildness of his early\r\ncharacter and became the bane of his own pontificate. His younger\r\nbrother Giovanni married a sister of Duke Guidobaldo, a union that\r\ncemented the friendship between the two families and furnished the Duchy\r\nof Urbino an heir in the person of Francesco Maria della Rovere. When\r\nJulius engaged Michelangelo to design his tomb, the old basilica of St.\r\nPeter’s was found too small to contain it, whereupon the pontiff is said\r\nto have decreed that a new church be built to receive it, and blessed\r\nthe laying of the first stone shortly before setting out on his campaign\r\nagainst Bologna in 1506. In 1508 he formed the League of Cambray for the\r\nrecovery of certain papal fiefs appropriated by Venice at the time of\r\nCesare Borgia’s downfall, and in 1511 the so-called Holy League for the\r\nexpulsion of the French from Italy. Italian unity was the unavowed but\r\nreal goal at which his policy aimed.\r\n\r\nAlthough a munificent patron of art and letters, Julius was frugal and\r\nsevere,—a man of action rather than a scholar or theologian. In giving\r\nMichelangelo directions for the huge bronze statue at Bologna, he said:\r\n“Put a sword in my hand; of letters I know nothing.” Another of his\r\nreported sayings is: “If we are not ourselves pious, why should we\r\nprevent others from being so?”\r\n\r\nNote 35 page 10. Although unexpressed in the original, the word\r\n‘learned’ seems necessary to complete the obvious meaning of the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nFrom his tutor Odasio of Padua, we learn that in his boyhood Guidobaldo\r\nwas even for the time exceptionally fond of study. He could repeat whole\r\ntreatises by heart ten years after reading them, and never forgot what\r\nhe resolved to retain. Besides his classical attainments, he appreciated\r\nthe Italian poets, and showed peculiar aptitude for philosophy and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nNote 36 page 10. The Italian _piacevolezza_ conveys somewhat the same\r\nsuggestion of humour which the word ‘pleasantness’ carried with it to\r\nthe English of Elizabeth’s time, and which still survives in our\r\n‘pleasantry.’\r\n\r\nNote 37 page 11. EMILIA PIA, (died 1528), was the youngest daughter of\r\nMarco Pio, one of the lords of Carpi. Her brother Giberto married a\r\nnatural daughter of Cardinal Ippolito d'Este (see note 64), while her\r\ncousin Alberto Pio (1475-1530) was the pupil and became the patron and\r\nfinancial supporter of the scholar-printer Aldus Manutius. In 1487 she\r\nwas married very young to the studious Count Antonio di Montefeltro (a\r\nnatural half-brother of Duke Guidobaldo), who left her a widow in 1500.\r\nShe resided at Urbino and became the trusted and inseparable companion\r\nof the Duchess Elisabetta, whom she accompanied on journeys and in\r\nexile, ever faithful in misfortune and sorrow. In the duchess’s\r\ntestament she was named as legatee and executrix. She seems to have died\r\nwithout the sacraments of the Church, while discussing passages of the\r\nnewly published COURTIER with Count Ludovico Canossa. The part taken by\r\nher in these dialogues evinces the charm of her winning manners as well\r\nas her possession of a variety of knowledge and graceful accomplishment\r\nrare even in that age of womanly genius. Always ready to lead or second\r\nthe learned and sportive pastimes by which the court circle of Urbino\r\ngave zest to their intercourse and polish to their wit, she was of\r\ninfinite service to the duchess, whose own acquirements were of a less\r\nbrilliant kind.\r\n\r\nNote 38 page 11. It may be doubted whether the duchess’s influence\r\nalways availed to secure what we should now regard as decorous behaviour\r\nat her court, and in an earlier draft of THE COURTIER Castiglione\r\nallowed himself a freedom, not to say licence, of expression singularly\r\nin contrast with the general tone of the version published.\r\n\r\nNote 39 page 12. The duchess and her husband were expelled from their\r\ndominions by Cesare Borgia in 1502, and again in 1516 she was compelled\r\nto leave Urbino for a longer time, when Leo X seized the duchy for his\r\nnephew Lorenzo de' Medici. Her conduct on these occasions showed rare\r\nfortitude and dignity.\r\n\r\nNote 40 page 12. These devices, so much in vogue during the 16th century\r\nin Italy, were the “inventions” which Giovio (a contemporary writer upon\r\nthe subject) says “the great lords and noble cavaliers of our time like\r\nto wear on their armour, caparisons and banners, to signify a part of\r\ntheir generous thoughts.” They consisted of a figure or picture, and a\r\nmotto nearly always in Latin. The fashion is said to have been copied\r\nfrom the French at the time of the invasions of Charles VIII and Louis\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nNote 41 page 12. FEDERICO FREGOSO, (born 1480; died 1541), was a younger\r\nbrother of Ottaviano (see note 11), and was educated for holy orders\r\nunder the direction of his uncle Duke Guidobaldo, at whose court he also\r\nperfected himself in worldly accomplishments. In 1507 Julius II made him\r\nArchbishop of Salerno, in the kingdom of Naples, but, owing to his\r\nsupposed French sympathies, he was not allowed to enjoy this benefice,\r\nand the next year was put in charge of the bishopric of Gubbio. In the\r\nsame year he was sent by Julius with the latter’s physician to attend\r\nDuke Guidobaldo’s death-bed, but arrived too late. During the nine years\r\nthat followed his brother’s election as Doge of Genoa (1513), he by\r\nturns commanded the army of the Republic, led her fleet against the\r\nBarbary pirates (whom he routed in their own harbours), and represented\r\nher at the papal court. During the Spanish siege of Genoa in 1522, he\r\nescaped to France, was warmly received by Francis I, and made Abbot of\r\nSt. Bénigne at Dijon, where he devoted himself to theological study. In\r\n1528 he returned to Italy and was appointed to the see of Gubbio. His\r\npiety and zeal for the welfare of his flock won for him the title of\r\n“father to the poor and refuge of the distressed.” In 1539 he was made a\r\ncardinal, and two years later died at Gubbio, being succeeded in that\r\nsee by his friend Bembo. After his death, a discourse of his on prayer\r\nhappening to be reprinted together with a work by Luther, he was for a\r\ntime erroneously supposed to have been heretical. He was a profound\r\nstudent of Hebrew, and an appreciative collector of Provençal poetry.\r\nHis own writings are chiefly doctrinal, and his reputation rests rather\r\nupon his friends’ praise of his wit, gentleness, personal\r\naccomplishments and learning, than upon the present value of his extant\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nNote 42 page 12. PIETRO BEMBO, (born at Venice 1470; died at Rome 1547),\r\nwas the son of a noble Venetian, Bernardo Bembo (a man of much\r\ncultivation, who paid for the restoration of Dante’s tomb at Ravenna),\r\nand Elena Marcella. Having received his early education at Florence,\r\nwhere his father was Venetian ambassador, he studied Greek at Messina\r\nunder Lascaris (a native of Hellas, whose grammar of that tongue was the\r\nfirst Greek book ever printed, 1476), and philosophy at Padua and\r\nFerrara, where his father was Venetian envoy and introduced him to the\r\nEste court. Here he became acquainted with Lucrezia Borgia, who had\r\nrecently wedded Duke Ercole’s son Alfonso, and to whom he dedicated his\r\ndialogues on love, _Gli Asolani_. By some writers indeed he is said to\r\nhave been her lover, but the report is hardly confirmed by the character\r\nof the letters exchanged between the two, 1503-1516. Having been\r\nentertained at Urbino in 1505, he spent the larger part of the next six\r\nyears at that court, where he profited by the fine library, delighted in\r\nmany congenial spirits, and became the close friend of Giuliano de'\r\nMedici, who took him to Rome in 1512 and recommended him to the future\r\npope, Leo X. On attaining the tiara, Leo at once appointed him and his\r\nfriend Sadoleto (see note 242) papal secretaries, an office for which\r\nhis learning and courtly accomplishments well fitted him. His laxity of\r\nmorals and his paganism were no disqualification in the eyes of the\r\npope, whom he served also in several diplomatic missions, and from whom\r\nhe received benefices and pensions sufficient to enrich him for life. In\r\n1518 his friend Castiglione sent him the MS. of THE COURTIER, requesting\r\nhim to “take the trouble ... to read it either wholly or in part,” and\r\nto give his opinion of it. Ten years later, when the book was printed,\r\nit was Bembo to whom the proofs were sent for correction, the author\r\nbeing absent in Spain. Even before the death of Leo X in 1521, Bembo had\r\nentered upon a life of literary retirement at Padua, where his library\r\nand art collection, as well as the learned society that he drew about\r\nhim, rendered his house famous. Nor was it less esteemed by reason of\r\nthe presence, at its head, of an avowed mistress (Morosina), who bore\r\nhim several children. After her death, he devoted himself to theology,\r\nentered holy orders, reluctantly accepted a cardinal’s hat in 1539, and\r\nin 1541 succeeded his friend Fregoso in the bishopric of Gubbio, to\r\nwhich was added that of Bergamo. His death was occasioned by a fall from\r\nhis horse, and he was buried at Rome in the Minerva church, between his\r\npatrons Leo X and Clement VII. His works are noteworthy less for their\r\nsubstance than for the refining influence exerted by their form. He is\r\nsaid to have subjected all his writings to sixteen (some say forty)\r\nseparate revisions, and a legend survives to the effect that he advised\r\na young cleric (Sadoleto) to avoid reading the Epistles of St. Paul,\r\nlest they might mar the youth’s style. His numerous private and official\r\nletters have preserved many valuable facts and furnish interesting\r\nillustration of contemporary manners and character. Humboldt praises him\r\nas the first Italian author to write attractive descriptions of natural\r\nscenery, and cites especially his dialogue on Mt. Ætna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GIACOMO SADOLETO\r\n  1477-1547\r\n]\r\n\r\nHead enlarged from a photograph, specially made by Alinari, of a part of\r\n    the fresco, “Leo X's Entry into Florence,” in the Palazzo Vecchio at\r\n    Florence, by Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574).

CESARE GONZAGA, (born about 1475; died 1512), was a\r\nnative of Mantua, being descended from a younger branch of the ruling\r\nfamily of that city, and a cousin of Castiglione, with whom he\r\nmaintained a close friendship. His father’s name was Giampietro, and he\r\nhad a brother Luigi. Having received a courtly and martial education at\r\nMilan, and after spending some time with his relatives at Mantua, he\r\nentered the service of Duke Guidobaldo of Urbino. In 1504 he shared\r\nCastiglione’s lodgings after their return from a campaign against Cesare\r\nBorgia’s strongholds in Romagna, and in the carnival of 1506 they\r\ntogether recited Castiglione’s eclogue _Tirsi_, in the authorship of\r\nwhich he is by some credited with a part. A graceful canzonet, preserved\r\nin Atanagi’s _Rime Scelte_, attests his skill in versification. On\r\nGuidobaldo’s death in 1508, the two friends remained in the service of\r\nthe new duke, Francesco Maria. In 1511 Cesare fought bravely against the\r\nFrench at Mirandola, and the next year took part in the reduction of\r\nBologna, where he soon died of an acute fever. Little more is known of\r\nhim, beyond the fact that he was a knight of St. John of Jerusalem, that\r\nLeo X sent him on a mission to Charles V of Spain, and that he was among\r\nthe many friends of the famous Isabella d'Este (see note 397).\r\n\r\nNote 44 page 12. Count LUDOVICO DA CANOSSA, (born 1476; died 1532),\r\nbelonged to a noble Veronese family (still honourably extant), and was a\r\nclose friend of Castiglione and a cousin of the latter’s mother. His\r\nboyhood was passed at Mantua, and his happiest years at Urbino, where he\r\nwas received in 1496. In the pontificate of Julius II he went to Rome,\r\nand was made Bishop of Tricarico, in southern Italy, 1511. Under Leo X\r\nhe was entrusted with several embassies, one of which (1514) was to\r\nEngland to reconcile Henry VIII with Louis XII, and another (1515) was\r\nto the new French king, Francis I, at whose court he continued to\r\nreside, and through whose influence he was made Bishop of Bayeux in\r\n1516. In 1526 and 1527 he served as French ambassador to Venice. His\r\nability and zeal as a diplomatist are shown not only by the importance\r\nof the posts that he held, but by his numerous letters that have been\r\npreserved. At the time of his friend Bibbiena’s death in 1520, Canossa\r\nremarked that it was a fixed belief among the French that every man of\r\nrank who died in Italy was poisoned.\r\n\r\nNote 45 page 12. GASPAR PALLAVICINO, (born 1486; died 1511), was a\r\ndescendant of the marquesses of Cortemaggiore, near Piacenza. He appears\r\nin THE COURTIER as the youthful woman-hater of the company, and was a\r\nfriend of Castiglione and Bembo. For an interesting discussion of his\r\nrôle in the dialogues, see Miss Scott’s paper, cited above (page 316).\r\n\r\nNote 46 page 12. LUDOVICO PIO belonged to the famous family of the lords\r\nof Carpi (a few miles north of Modena), and was a brave captain in the\r\nservice of the Aragonese princes, of Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan, and\r\nof Pope Julius II. His father Leonello and more celebrated uncle Alberto\r\nhad been pupils of Aldus, and were second cousins of Emilia Pia. His\r\nwife was the beautiful Graziosa Maggi of Milan, who is immortalized in\r\nthe paintings of Francia and the writings of Bembo.\r\n\r\nNote 47 page 12. SIGISMONDO MORELLO DA ORTONA is presented in THE\r\nCOURTIER as the only elderly member of the company, and the object of\r\nmany youthful jests. He is known to have taken part in the ceremony of\r\nthe formal adoption of Francesco Maria della Rovere as heir to the duchy\r\nin 1504, is referred to in Castiglione’s _Tirsi_, and seems to have been\r\nsomething of a musician.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LOUIS XII OF FRANCE\r\n  1462-1515\r\n]\r\n\r\nMuch enlarged from a negative, specially made by Berthaud, of a part of\r\n    a pen-drawing in the National Library at Paris. The drawing is\r\n    touched with gold, and forms part of a series illustrating a MS.\r\n    chronicle (nos. 20360-2) engrossed at Genoa in 1510 by Anthoine\r\n    Bardin. See note 250.\r\n\r\nNote 48 page 12. Of ROBERTO DA BARI little more is known than that his\r\nsurname was MASSIMO, and that he was taken ill in the campaign of 1510\r\nagainst the Venetians and retired to Mantua. Thither Castiglione sent a\r\nletter to his mother, warmly recommending Roberto to her hospitality,\r\nand saying that he loved the man like a brother.\r\n\r\nNote 49 page 12. BERNARDO ACCOLTI, (born about 1465; died 1535), was\r\ngenerally known as the UNICO ARETINO, from the name of his birthplace\r\n(Arezzo) and in compliment to his ‘unique’ faculty for extemporising\r\nverse. His father Benedetto was a jurist, and the author of a dull Latin\r\nhistory of the First Crusade, from which Tasso is believed to have drawn\r\nmaterial for the _Gerusalemme Liberata_. His poetical celebrity\r\ncommended him to the court of Urbino, where (as at Rome and in other\r\nplaces) he was in the habit of reciting his verses to vast audiences of\r\nrich and poor alike. When an exhibition by him was announced, guards had\r\nto be set to restrain the crowds that rushed to secure places, the shops\r\nwere closed, and the streets emptied. His life was a kind of lucrative\r\npoetic vagabondage: thus we find him flourishing, caressed and\r\napplauded, at the courts of Urbino, Mantua, Naples, and especially at\r\nthat of Leo X, who bestowed many offices upon him, of which, however,\r\nhis wealth (acquired by his recitations) rendered him independent,\r\nenabling him to indulge in a life of literary ease. His elder brother\r\nPietro became a cardinal, bought Raphael’s house, and is said to have\r\nhad a hand in drafting the papal bull against Luther in 1520. He was an\r\nearly patron of his notorious fellow-townsman Pietro Aretino. Such of\r\nhis verse as has survived is so bald and stilted as to excite no little\r\nwonderment at the esteem which he enjoyed among his contemporaries. In\r\nTHE COURTIER he poses as the sentimental and afflicted lover, the\r\n“slayer” of duchesses and other noble ladies, who (according to his own\r\naccount) kept flocking in his train, but who more probably were often\r\nmaking sport of him.\r\n\r\nNote 50 page 12. GIANCRISTOFORO ROMANO, (born about 1465; died 1512),\r\nwas the son of Isaia di Pippo of Pisa and the pupil of Paolo Romano.\r\nPerhaps best known as a sculptor, he possessed skill also as a\r\ngoldsmith, medallist, architect and crystal carver, cultivated music and\r\nwrote verse. During the last years of the Sforza power at Milan, he\r\naccompanied the duke’s wife, Beatrice d'Este, from place to place, and\r\nis now identified as the author of her portrait bust in the Louvre. He\r\nexecuted also at least two portrait medals of her sister Isabella\r\nd'Este, acted as adviser and agent of the Gonzagas in the purchase of\r\nart objects, worked at Venice, Cremona, Rome and Naples, and is known to\r\nhave been at Urbino about the time of the Courtier dialogues. In a long\r\nletter written by him to Bembo in 1510, he describes the court of Urbino\r\nas “a true temple of chastity, decorum and pudicity.” In 1512 he was\r\ndirecting architect at Loreto (see note 311), where he died in May,\r\nbequeathing his collection of medals and antiques to a hospital, for the\r\npurpose of having three masses said weekly for the repose of his soul.\r\n\r\nNote 51 page 12. Of PIETRO MONTE little more is known than that he was a\r\nmaster of military exercises at the Urbino court, and perhaps a captain\r\nin the duke’s army. He may have been identical with one Pietro dal\r\nMonte, who is mentioned as a soldier in the pay of Venice (1509), and\r\ndescribed as “blind in one eye, but of great valour, gentle speech, and\r\nnot unlearned in letters,” and as “commanding 1500 infantry, and a man\r\nof great experience not only in war but in affairs of the world.”\r\n\r\nNote 52 page 12. ANTONIO MARIA TERPANDRO, one of the most jovial and\r\nwelcome visitors at Urbino, is said by Dennistoun to have been a musical\r\nornament of the court. He enjoyed the heartiest friendship of Bembo and\r\nBibbiena.\r\n\r\nNote 53 page 12. NICCOLῸ FRISIO or FRIGIO is mentioned in a letter by\r\nBembo as a German, but seems more probably to have been an Italian.\r\nDennistoun speaks of him as a musician. In a letter from Castiglione to\r\nhis mother (1506), the writer warmly commends to her “one messer Niccolò\r\nFrisio, who I hear is there [i.e., in Mantua], and I earnestly hope that\r\nyou will treat him kindly, for I am under the greatest obligation to him\r\nwith respect to my Roman illness.... I am sure he loves me well.” In\r\nanother letter by a friend of Bembo, Frisio is described (1509) as an\r\nItalian long resident in courts, sure of heart, gentle, a good linguist,\r\nfaithful to his employers, and as having been used by Julius II in\r\nnegotiating the League of Cambray against Venice. He had relations also\r\nwith the marchioness Isabella of Mantua (see note 397), whom he aided in\r\nthe collection of antiquities. Growing weary of worldly life, he became\r\na monk in 1510, and retired to the Certosa of Naples.\r\n\r\nNote 54 page 12. According to Cian, _omini piacevoli_ (rendered\r\n‘agreeable men’) here means ‘buffoons.’\r\n\r\nNote 55 page 13. This passage establishes the date of the first dialogue\r\nas 8 March 1507.\r\n\r\nNote 56 page 13. My lady Emilia contends that she has already told her\r\nchoice of a game, in proposing that the rest of the company should tell\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nNote 57 page 14. COSTANZA FREGOSA was a sister of the two Fregoso\r\nbrothers already mentioned, and a faithful companion of the Duchess of\r\nUrbino. She married Count Marcantonio Landi of Piacenza, and bore him\r\ntwo worthy children, Agostino and Caterina, to the former of whom Bembo\r\nstood sponsor and became a kind of second father. Three letters by the\r\nlady have been preserved.\r\n\r\nNote 58 page 15. Belief in the efficacy of music as a cure for the bite\r\nof the tarantula still survives in Andalusia, Sardinia and parts of\r\nsouthern Italy. In a note on the tarantella dance, Goethe wrote: “It has\r\nbeen remarked that in the case of mental ailments, and of a tarantula\r\nbite, which is probably cured by perspiration, the movements of this\r\ndance have a very salutary effect on the softer sex.” “Travels in Italy”\r\n(Ed. Bohn, 1883), page 564.\r\n\r\nNote 59 page 15. The _moresca_ (mime or morris-dance) seems to have been\r\na kind of ballet or story in dance, often very intricate and fanciful.\r\nAt the courts of this period, it was generally introduced as an\r\ninterlude between the acts of a comedy. In a letter quoted by Dennistoun\r\n(“Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino,” ii, 141), Castiglione describes a\r\n_moresca_ on the story of Jason, which was thus performed at the first\r\npresentation of Bibbiena’s _Calandra_ before the court of Urbino, 6\r\nFebruary 1513.\r\n\r\nNote 60 page 16. FRA MARIANO FETTI, (born 1460; died 1531), was a native\r\nof Florence, and beginning life as a barber to Lorenzo de' Medici,\r\nalways remained faithful to that family. At Rome, during the pontificate\r\nof Julius II, he won the reputation and enjoyed the privileges of “the\r\nprince of jesters,” and became even more famous under Leo X, upon whom\r\nas a child he had bestowed affectionate care, and who as pope did not\r\nforget his kindness. Thus in 1514 he was made _Frate piombatore_, or\r\naffixer of lead seals to papal bulls, in which office he followed the\r\narchitect Bramante, was succeeded by the painter Sebastiano Luciani\r\n(better known as “del Piombo”), and admitted earning yearly what would\r\nnow be the equivalent of about £1600, by turning lead into gold. While\r\nit remains uncertain whether he was more buffoon or friar, he had a\r\ngreat love for artists, and even composed verse. He seems to have\r\ncontinued in the enjoyment of fame and favour during the reign of the\r\nsecond Medicean pope, Clement VII.\r\n\r\nNote 61 page 16. FRA SERAFINO was probably a Mantuan, and had a brother\r\nSebastiano. He lived long at the Gonzaga court, where he was employed in\r\norganizing festivals, and at Urbino, where the few of his letters that\r\nhave survived show him in familiar relations with other interlocutors in\r\nTHE COURTIER. While at Rome in 1507, with the suite of the Duchess of\r\nUrbino, he was seriously wounded in the head by an unknown assailant,\r\nprobably in return for some lampoon or scandal of his against the papal\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nNote 62 page 17. This letter S was evidently one of the golden ciphers\r\nthat ladies of the period were fond of wearing on a circlet about their\r\nheads. In her portrait the duchess is represented as wearing a narrow\r\nband, from which the image of a scorpion hangs upon her forehead. The S\r\nmay have been used on this occasion as the initial letter of the word\r\nscorpion, and seems in any case to have been an instance of the\r\n‘devices’ mentioned in note 40.\r\n\r\nA sonnet, purporting to be the work of the Unico Aretino, was inserted\r\nin the edition of THE COURTIER published by Rovillio at Lyons in 1562\r\nand in several later editions, as being the sonnet here mentioned. In\r\nits place, however, Cian prints another sonnet, preserved in the\r\nMarciana Library at Venice and possessing higher claims to authenticity.\r\nSome idea of the baldness of both may be gained from the following crude\r\nbut tolerably literal translation of the second sonnet:\r\n\r\n          Consent, O Sea of beauty and virtue,\r\n       That I, thy slave, may of great doubt be freed,\r\n       Whether the S thou wearest on thy candid brow\r\n       Signifies my Suffering or my Salvation,\r\n          Whether it means Succour or Servitude,\r\n       Suspicion or Security, Secret or Silliness,\r\n       Whether ’Spectation or Shriek, whether Safe or Sepultured!\r\n       Whether my bonds be Strait or Severed:\r\n          For much I fear lest it give Sign\r\n       Of Stateliness, Sighing, Severity,\r\n       Scorn, Slash, Sweat, Stress and Spite.\r\n          But if for naked truth a place there be,\r\n       This S shows with no little art\r\n       A Sun single in beauty and in cruelty.\r\n\r\nNote 63 page 18. The pains of love were a frequent theme with Bembo, and\r\nare elaborately set forth in his _Gli Asolani_. Quite untranslatable\r\ninto English, his play upon the words _amore_ (love) and _amaro_\r\n(bitter) is at least as old as Plautus’s _Trinummus_.\r\n\r\nNote 64 page 22. IPPOLITO D'ESTE, (born 1479; died 1520), was the third\r\nson of Duke Ercole I of Ferrara (see note 203) and Eleanora of Aragon\r\n(see note 399). At the instance of his maternal aunt Beatrice’s husband,\r\nKing Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (see note 395), he was given the rich\r\narchbishopric of Strigonio, to which was attached the primacy of that\r\ncountry, and made the journey thither as a mere boy. In 1493 Alexander\r\nVI made him a cardinal. Soon after the death of his sister Beatrice, her\r\nhusband Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan gave him the vacant archbishopric\r\nof that city, and the same year (1497) he exchanged the Hungarian\r\nprimacy, with its burdensome requirement of foreign residence, for the\r\nbishopric of Agria in Crete. In 1502 he was made Archbishop of Capua in\r\nthe kingdom of Naples, but bestowed the revenues of the see upon his\r\nwidowed and impoverished aunt, the ex-Queen of Hungary, and a little\r\nlater was made Bishop of Ferrara,—all before reaching the age of\r\ntwenty-four years. He was also Bishop of Modena and Abbot of Pomposa.\r\nDuring his brother’s reign at Ferrara, the young cardinal took an active\r\npart in public affairs, several times governing in the duke’s absence,\r\nand showing brilliant capacities for military command. After the\r\naccession of Leo X, he resided chiefly at Rome, where he was always a\r\nconspicuous figure and carefully guarded his brother’s interests. He was\r\na friend and protector of Leonardo da Vinci, and maintained Ariosto in\r\nhis service from 1503 to 1517. A prelate only in name, regarding his\r\nmany ecclesiastical offices merely as a source of wealth, he united the\r\nfaults and vices to the grace and culture of his time.\r\n\r\nNote 65 page 26. BERTO was probably one of the many buffoons about the\r\npapal court in the time of Julius II and Leo X. He is again mentioned in\r\nthe text (page 128) for his powers of mimicry, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MATTHIAS CORVINUS OF HUNGARY\r\n  1443-1490\r\n]\r\n\r\nMuch enlarged from a cast, courteously furnished by the Austrian\r\n    authorities, of an anonymous medal in the Imperial Museum at Vienna\r\n    (Armand’s _Les Médailleurs Italiens_, ii, 82, no. 9). See note 395.\r\n\r\nNote 66 page 26. This “brave lady” is by some identified as the famous\r\nCaterina Sforza, a natural daughter of Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza of\r\nMilan, who by the last of her three husbands became the mother of the\r\neven more famous _condottiere_ Giovanni de' Medici delle Bande Nere. She\r\nwas born in 1462, and died in 1509 after a life of singular\r\nvicissitudes. For an extraordinary story of her courage, see\r\nDennistoun’s “Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino,” i, 292.\r\n\r\nThe “one whom I will not name at present” is supposed to have been a\r\ncertain brave soldier of fortune, Gaspar Sanseverino, who is often\r\nmentioned as “Captain Fracassa,” and was a brother of the Galeazzo\r\nSanseverino who appears a little later in THE COURTIER (see page 34 and\r\nnote 72).\r\n\r\nNote 67 page 28. The philosopher in question has been variously\r\nidentified as Democritus and Empedocles.\r\n\r\nNote 68 page 30. In Charles V's romantic plan for deciding by single\r\ncombat his rivalry with Francis I, Castiglione was selected as his\r\nsecond, but declined to violate diplomatic proprieties by accepting the\r\noffer,—being at the time papal envoy at Charles’s court.\r\n\r\nNote 69 page 31. Strictly speaking, the joust was a single contest\r\nbetween man and man, while the tourney was a sham battle between two\r\nsquadrons. Stick-throwing seems to have been an equestrian game\r\nintroduced by the Moors into Spain, and by the Spaniards into Italy. In\r\nthe carnival of 1519 it was played by two companies in the Piazza of St.\r\nPeter’s before Leo X.\r\n\r\nNote 70 page 31. Vaulting on horse seems to have included some of the\r\nfeats of agility with which modern circus riders have familiarized us.\r\n\r\nNote 71 page 33. “Finds grace,” i.e. favour: literally “is grateful”\r\n(_grato_) in the sense of acceptable or pleasing. Compare the familiar\r\nphrase _persona grata_.\r\n\r\nNote 72 page 34. GALEAZZO SANSEVERINO was one of the twelve stalwart\r\nsons of Roberto Sanseverino, a brave _condottiere_ who aided to place\r\nLudovico Sforza in power at Milan, rebelled against that prince, and was\r\nslain while fighting for the Venetians in 1486. Galeazzo entered the\r\nservice of Ludovico, whose favour had been attracted by his personal\r\ncharm, literary accomplishments and rare skill in knightly exercises.\r\nWhen he married his patron’s natural daughter Bianca, in 1489, Leonardo\r\nda Vinci arranged the jousts held in honour of the wedding. Thenceforth\r\nhe adopted the names Visconti and Sforza, and was treated as a member of\r\nthe ducal family. In 1496, at the head of the Milanese forces, he\r\nbesieged the Duke of Orleans (afterwards Louis XII) at Novara, but in\r\n1500 he was captured by the French, and after the final downfall of\r\nLudovico (to whom he seems to have remained creditably loyal) he entered\r\nthe service of Louis XII, who made him Grand Equerry in 1506. The duties\r\nof his office included the superintendence of all the royal stables and\r\nof an academy for the martial education of young men of noble family.\r\nFor a further account of his interesting life, and especially of his\r\nfriendship with Isabella d'Este, see Mrs. Henry Ady’s recent volume,\r\n“Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Milan.”\r\n\r\nNote 73 page 35. The word _sprezzatura_ (rendered “nonchalance”) could\r\nhardly have been new to Castiglione’s contemporaries, at least in its\r\nprimary meaning of disprizement or contempt. He may, however, have been\r\namong the first to use it (as here and elsewhere in THE COURTIER) in its\r\nmodified sense of unconcern or nonchalance. Compare Herrick’s ‘wild\r\ncivility’ in “Art above Nature” and “Delight in Disorder.”\r\n\r\nNote 74 page 37. Naturally Venice could hardly be a place well suited\r\nfor horsemanship; its citizens’ awkward riding was a favourite subject\r\nof ridicule in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nNote 75 page 37. The incident is supposed to have occurred on the\r\noccasion of a visit paid by Apelles to Rhodes not long after the death\r\n(323 B.C.) of Alexander the Great, whom he had accompanied into Asia\r\nMinor. Apelles was eager to meet Protogenes, and on landing in Rhodes\r\nwent at once to the painter’s house. Protogenes was absent, but a large\r\npanel stood ready for painting. Apelles took a pencil and drew an\r\nexceedingly fine coloured line, by which Protogenes on his return\r\nimmediately recognized who his visitor had been, and in turn drew a\r\nfiner line of another colour upon or within the first line. When Apelles\r\nsaw this line, he added a third line still further subdividing the one\r\ndrawn by Protogenes. Later the panel was carried to Rome, where it long\r\nexcited wondering admiration in the Palace of the Cæsars, with which it\r\nwas finally destroyed by fire. Apelles was the first to stimulate\r\nappreciation of the merits of Protogenes by buying several of the\r\nlatter’s works at enormous prices: he maintained however that he\r\nexcelled Protogenes in knowing when to cease elaborating his paintings.\r\n\r\nNote 76 page 37. The play upon words here is untranslatable into\r\nEnglish. The Italian _tavola_ stands equally well for a dining-table and\r\nfor the tablet or panel upon which pictures were painted.\r\n\r\nNote 77 page 40. ‘As those who speak [are present] before those who\r\nspeak’ is a literal translation of the accepted reading of this passage.\r\nIt is perhaps worth noting, however, that the earliest translator\r\n(Boscan) ventures to deviate from the letter of the Italian text for the\r\nsake of rendering what surely must have been the author’s meaning: _como\r\nlos que hablan á aquellos con quien hablan_, i.e. “as those who speak\r\n[are present] before those _with whom_ they speak.”\r\n\r\nNote 78 page 41. Although the dialect of Bergamo was (and still is)\r\nridiculed as rude and harsh, it possessed a copious popular literature.\r\n\r\nNote 79 page 41. FRANCESCO PETRARCA or PETRARCH, (born 1304; died 1374),\r\nbelonged to a family that was banished from Florence at the same time\r\nwith Dante, whom he remembered seeing in his childhood. He was the first\r\nItalian of his time to appreciate the value of public libraries, to\r\ncollect coins and inscriptions as sources of accurate historical\r\ninformation, and to urge the preservation of ancient monuments. Had he\r\nnever written a line of verse, he would still be venerated as the\r\napostle of scholarship, as the chief originator of humanistic impulses\r\nbased upon what Symonds describes as “a new and vital perception of the\r\ndignity of man considered as a rational being apart from theological\r\ndeterminations, and ... the further perception that classic literature\r\nalone displayed human nature in the plenitude of intellectual and moral\r\nfreedom.”\r\n\r\nNote 80 page 41. In an age when grammatical and rhetorical treatises, in\r\nthe modern sense of the word, hardly existed, it was natural that the\r\nstudy of classic models should take the form of imitation.\r\n\r\nNote 81 page 42. It will be remembered that Giuliano de' Medici was a\r\nnative Tuscan.\r\n\r\nNote 82 page 43. This Tuscan triumvirate was called “the three\r\nFlorentine crowns:” Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio.\r\n\r\nNote 83 page 44. EVANDER was a mythical son of Hermes, supposed to have\r\nfounded a colony on the Tiber before the Trojan War. TURNUS was a\r\nlegendary king of an Italian tribe, who was slain by Æneas.\r\n\r\nNote 84 page 44. The Salian priests were attached to the worship of Mars\r\nGradivus. On the occasion of their annual festival, they went in\r\nprocession through Rome, carrying the sacred shields of which they were\r\ncustodians and which they beat in accompaniment to dance and song. The\r\nwords of their chaunts are said to have become unintelligible even to\r\nthemselves, and appear to have set forth a kind of theogony in praise of\r\nall the celestial deities (excepting Venus), and especially of one\r\nMamurius Veturius, who is by some regarded as identical with Mars.\r\n\r\nNote 85 page 44. MARCUS ANTONIUS (143-87 B.C.) and LICINIUS CRASSUS\r\n(140-91 B.C.), the two most famous orators of early Rome, were regarded\r\nby Cicero as having been the first to rival their Greek predecessors.\r\nQUINTUS HORTENSIUS HORTALUS (114-50 B.C.), the great advocate of the\r\naristocratic party at Rome, yielded the palm of oratory only to CICERO\r\n(106-43 B.C.). MARCUS PORCIUS CATO (234-149 B.C.), a Roman soldier,\r\nauthor and reforming statesman, sought to restore the ancient purity and\r\nsimplicity of the earlier republic. QUINTUS ENNIUS (239-169 B.C.), a\r\nRoman epic poet and annalist, imparted to the language and literature of\r\nhis nation much of the impulse that affected their growth for centuries.\r\nVIRGIL was born 70 B.C., and died 19 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 86 page 44.

In his _Prose_, Bembo says that courtly Italian,\r\nespecially during the pontificate of the Spaniard, Alexander VI\r\n(1492-1503), was full of Spanish expressions,—an assertion amply\r\nconfirmed by contemporary letters, which are rich also in Gallicisms.\r\n\r\nNote 89 page 46. The Spanish _primor_ has failed to win Italian\r\ncitizenship. _Aventurare_ has become naturalized in Italy; as also have\r\n_acertare_ (in the sense, however, of to assure, to make certain, to\r\nverify), _ripassare_ (to repass, to repeat, to rebuff), _rimproccio_ or\r\n_rimprovero_, and _attilato_ or _attillato_, which is recognizable in\r\nthe Spanish _atildado_. _Creato_ (Spanish _criado_) is now replaced by\r\n_creatura_ in the sense mentioned in the text; in Sicily _creato_ is\r\nused to mean servant.\r\n\r\nNote 90 page 47.

Of the four forms here condemned by Castiglione as\r\ncorrupt, three (_Campidoglio_, _Girolamo_, and _padrone_) have become\r\nfirmly established in Italian. _Campidoglio_ had been used by Petrarch\r\n(_Trionfo d'Amore_, i, 14),—an “old” but certainly not an “ignorant”\r\nTuscan.\r\n\r\nNote 93 page 49. Oscan was a pre-Roman language spoken by the Opici, an\r\nItalian tribe inhabiting the Campanian coast. Much of the mist that\r\nshrouded it for centuries has now been dispelled by the epigraphists.\r\nBoth Dante and Petrarch were great lovers of Provençal, with which in\r\nCastiglione’s time his friend Federico Fregoso was familiar.\r\n\r\nNote 94 page 50. BIDON was a native of Asti, and one of the most famous\r\nchoristers in the service of Leo X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANDREA MANTEGNA\r\n  1431-1506\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a part of Alinari’s photograph (no. 18657) of the bronze\r\n    relief, surmounting Mantegna’s tomb in the Church of Sant'Andrea at\r\n    Mantua, variously attributed to Bartolommeo di Virgilio Melioli\r\n    (1448-1514), to Giovanni Marco Cavalli (born 1450), and, with less\r\n    reason, to Sperandio di Bartolommeo de' Savelli (1425?-1500?).\r\n\r\nNote 95 page 50. MARCHETTO CARA, a native of Verona, entered the service\r\nof the Gonzagas in 1495 and lived nearly thirty years at Mantua, where\r\nhe was made a citizen by the Marquess Federico. He frequented also the\r\ncourt of Urbino, and is known to have been sent by the Marchioness\r\nIsabella to relieve the tedium of her friend and sister-in-law the\r\nDuchess Elisabetta’s exile at Venice in 1503. In his time he was among\r\nthe most prolific and successful composers of profane music, especially\r\nof ballads and madrigals, and a number of his popular pieces have been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nNote 96 page 50. LEONARDO DA VINCI, (born 1452; died 1519), was the\r\nnatural son of a notary, Pietro Antonio, of the village of Vinci,\r\nsituated about fourteen miles east of Florence. He studied some three\r\nyears with Donatello’s pupil Verocchio at Florence. Meeting small\r\npecuniary success there, he removed to Milan about 1483 and entered the\r\nservice of Duke Ludovico Sforza, who is said to have paid him the\r\nequivalent of £4000 a year while painting the “Last Supper,” and for\r\nwhom he completed in 1493 the model of a colossal equestrian statue of\r\nDuke Francesco Sforza, never executed in permanent form. He was employed\r\nby Cesare Borgia as military engineer, and in that capacity visited\r\nUrbino in July 1502. His famous portrait known as the “Monna Lisa” or\r\n“La Gioconda,” upon which he worked at times for four years, was\r\nfinished about 1504 and afterwards sold by him to Francis I. In 1507, he\r\nhad been appointed painter to Louis XII, but did not visit France until\r\n1516. On the election of Leo X in 1513, he journeyed to Rome in the\r\ncompany and service of Giuliano de' Medici, who paid him a monthly\r\nstipend of £66. Although he was received with favour by the new pope and\r\nlodged in the Vatican, his stay in Rome was artistically unprolific, his\r\ninterest at the time being chiefly confined to chemistry and physics,\r\nand nature attracting him more than antiquities, of which he spoke as\r\n“this old rubbish” (_queste anticaglie_). Three years before his death\r\nhe was visited at Amboise in France by Cardinal Ludovico of Aragon, who\r\nis mentioned later in THE COURTIER (p. 159), and whose secretary left an\r\ninteresting account of an interview with him, describing the painter as\r\nthen disabled by paralysis of the hand.\r\n\r\nNote 97 page 50. ANDREA MANTEGNA, (born 1431; died 1506), was a native\r\nof Vicenza and probably of humble origin. When a mere child he became\r\nthe pupil and adopted son of the noted painter and instructor, Francesco\r\nSquarcione of Padua, and was soon enrolled in the painters’ guild of\r\nthat city. In 1449 he began painting for the d'Este at Ferrara, and\r\nbetween 1453 and 1459 he married Niccolosa, a daughter of Squarcione’s\r\nrival Giacopo Bellini, and sister of the more famous brothers Gentile\r\nand Giovanni Bellini. He painted also at Verona, and about 1460 entered\r\nthe service of the Gonzagas at Mantua, where the remainder of his life\r\nwas chiefly spent, although he worked for Pope Innocent VIII at Rome\r\nabout the year 1488, before which date he was knighted by the Marquess\r\nof Mantua. By one writer he is affirmed to have cast the fine bust which\r\nornaments his tomb at Mantua, and which is said once to have had diamond\r\neyes. He is known to have understood bronze casting, and besides the\r\nbrush and the engraver’s burin, he handled modelling tools, while a\r\nsonnet of his has been preserved. Although praised by Vasari as kindly\r\nand in every way estimable, he is shown by contemporary letters to have\r\nbeen rather irritable and litigious in private life. Albert Dürer tells\r\nus that one of the keenest disappointments of his life was occasioned by\r\nthe great painter’s death before he was able to make an intended journey\r\nto Mantua for the purpose of visiting Mantegna.\r\n\r\nNote 98 page 50. RAFFAELLO SANTI or SANZI,—euphonized by Bembo as\r\nSANZIO,—(born 1483; died 1520), was a native of Urbino and the son of\r\nGiovanni Santi and Magia Ciarla. The father was himself a painter of no\r\nmean skill, and wrote a quaint rhymed chronicle of the Duchy of Urbino,\r\nwhich is preserved in the Vatican and contains much interesting\r\ninformation. Having lost both parents when he had reached the age of\r\neleven years, and probably having first studied at Urbino under Timoteo\r\ndella Vite, Raphael was sent by a maternal uncle to the studio of\r\nPerugino at Perugia. The rest of his short life was an unbroken course\r\nof happy labour and brilliant success. In 1499 he seems to have been at\r\nUrbino for the purpose of arranging for the welfare of a sister, and\r\nagain in 1504, when, after executing several works (including, it is\r\nbelieved, portraits of the duke and duchess) for the ducal family, he\r\nwent to Florence with a letter of commendation from Guidobaldo’s sister.\r\nFrom 1504 to 1508 he resided chiefly at Florence, although he again\r\nvisited Urbino twice, just before and probably soon after the date of\r\nthe Courtier dialogues. His friendship with so many members of the\r\nUrbino court (Giuliano de' Medici, Bibbiena, Bembo, Canossa, and\r\nCastiglione), and even his acquaintance with Julius II, probably began\r\nduring these later visits to his native city. In 1508 he was called to\r\nRome by Julius, and resided there until his death. On succeeding\r\nBramante as architect of St. Peter’s in 1514, he wrote to Castiglione:\r\n“Sir Count: I have made drawings in several manners according to your\r\nsuggestion, and if everyone does not flatter me, I am satisfying\r\neveryone; but I do not satisfy my own judgment, because I dread not\r\nsatisfying yours. I am sending them to you. Pray choose any of them, if\r\nyou deem any worthy. Our Lord [i.e. Leo X] in honouring me has put a\r\ngreat burden on my shoulders,—that is, the charge of the fabric of St.\r\nPeter’s. I hope, however, not to fall under it; and the more so, because\r\nthe model I have made for it pleases his Holiness and is praised by many\r\nchoice spirits; but in thought I soar still higher. I fain would renew\r\nthe beautiful forms of ancient buildings, but know not whether my flight\r\nwill be that of Icarus. Vitruvius affords me much light on the subject,\r\nbut less than I need. As to Galatea, I should hold myself a great master\r\nif she possessed half the fine things you write me; but in your words I\r\nrecognize the love you bear me: and I tell you that to paint one\r\nbeautiful woman, I should need to see several beautiful women and to\r\nhave you with me to choose the best. But as there is dearth of good\r\njudgments and of beautiful women, I am using a certain idea that has\r\noccurred to my mind. Whether this has any artistic excellence in it, I\r\nknow not,—but I am striving for it. Command me.” Passavant affirms that\r\nthe ‘drawings’ mentioned at the beginning of this letter were designs\r\nfor a medal that Castiglione meant to wear. Raphael is said to have\r\npainted two portraits of Castiglione, one of which (1516) is in the\r\nLouvre and appears as the frontispiece to this volume. His epitaph was\r\nwritten by Bembo, while Castiglione composed a Latin elegy in his\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nNote 99 page 50. MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI, (born 1475; died 1564), was a\r\nnative of Caprese, a village about forty-seven miles south-east of\r\nFlorence, and the son of Ludovico Buonarroti Simoni and Francesca,\r\ndaughter of Neri del Sera. His first schoolmaster seems to have come\r\nfrom Urbino. Apprenticed at the age of thirteen to Ghirlandajo, he soon\r\ncame under the protection of Lorenzo de' Medici. In 1496 he removed to\r\nRome, and remained there five years. From 1501 to 1504 he was working\r\nupon the great statue of David at Florence, and prepared his cartoon for\r\na vast fresco on the Battle of Cascina, which, although never executed,\r\nwas often copied, and is said to have exerted a greater influence on the\r\nart of the Renaissance than any other single work. In 1505 he was called\r\nto Rome to design a colossal mausoleum for Julius II. The anxieties and\r\ndisappointments connected with this project became the continual tragedy\r\nof his long life. “Every day,” he wrote, “I am stoned as if I had\r\ncrucified Christ. My youth has been lost, bound hand and foot to this\r\ntomb.” The matter was finally ended by the placing of his statue of\r\nMoses in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli at Rome. In the spring of\r\n1506 he was present at the unearthing of the Laocoön, and at the date of\r\nthe Courtier dialogues he was engaged in casting a great bronze statue\r\nof Julius II at Bologna. Duke Guidobaldo’s collection at Urbino seems to\r\nhave included a Cupid made by Buonarroti in imitation of the antique,\r\noriginally owned by Cesare Borgia, regained by him when he captured\r\nUrbino in 1502, and soon presented by him to Guidobaldo’s sister-in-law,\r\nthe Marchioness Isabella d'Este of Mantua. The famous tomb statue of\r\nGiuliano de' Medici at Florence is hardly to be regarded as a portrait,\r\nand was of course executed long after the period of THE COURTIER. In\r\n1519 the Marquess of Mantua wrote to Castiglione, who was his ambassador\r\nat Rome, regarding a monument to his father that he hoped to have the\r\nmaster design. In 1523 Castiglione brought to Mantua a sketch made by\r\nBuonarroti for a villa which the marquess intended to build at\r\nMarmirolo.\r\n\r\nNote 100 page 50. GIORGIO BARBARELLI, known as GIORGIONE or “Big\r\nGeorge,” (born about 1478; died 1511), was a native of Castelfranco, a\r\ntown about forty miles north-west of Venice, and was reputed to be a\r\nnatural son of one Giacopo Barbarelli, a Venetian, and a peasant girl.\r\nLack of data renders a consecutive account of his life and work\r\nimpossible. He was brought up in Venice, and bred as a painter in the\r\nschool of the Bellini. Vasari says that he played upon the lute and sang\r\nwell, and was of a gentle disposition. Although he seems to have been\r\nexceptionally independent of great people, he enjoyed the especial\r\nfavour of the Marchioness Isabella d'Este of Mantua. In a letter written\r\nfrom Venice in the year before that of the Courtier dialogues, Albert\r\nDürer declared Giorgione to be the greatest painter in the city, which\r\ncould then boast of the Bellini, Palma Vecchio, Carpaccio and Titian.\r\nOne of the most acute of recent critics, Mr. Bernhard Berenson, ascribes\r\nto him only seventeen existing pictures, of which the best known is the\r\n_Fête Champêtre_ in the Louvre, while the only one whose authenticity is\r\nentirely free from doubt is the “Madonna and Saints” in the Duomo at\r\nCastelfranco. The Urbino collection comprised two portraits by\r\nGiorgione, one of which is supposed to have represented Duke Guidobaldo,\r\nbut unfortunately is lost.\r\n\r\nNote 101 page 51. ISOCRATES, (born 436; died 338 B.C.), an Athenian\r\norator, was a pupil of Socrates, and became the instructor of many\r\nfamous orators. His diction was of the purest Attic, and his writings\r\nwere highly prized by the Alexandrian grammarians. The first printed\r\nedition of his works (1493) was edited by Castiglione’s Greek master,\r\nChalcondylas. LYSIAS, (died about 380 B.C.), an Athenian orator,\r\nabandoned the stilted monotony of the older speakers, and employed the\r\nsimple language of every-day life, but with purity and grace. ÆSCHINES,\r\n(born 389; died 314 B.C.), was the rival and finally unsuccessful\r\nantagonist of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nNote 102 page 51. CAIUS PAPIRIUS CARBO, (Consul in 120 B.C.), was an\r\nadherent of the Gracchi, but became a renegade and finally committed\r\nsuicide. He was generally suspected of murdering Scipio Africanus the\r\nYounger. While abominating the man’s character, Cicero praises his\r\noratory. CAIUS LÆLIUS SAPIENS was Consul in 140 B.C. His friendship with\r\nScipio is commemorated in Cicero’s _De Amicitia_. While he was in his\r\nown time regarded as the model orator, later grammarians resorted to his\r\nworks for archaisms. SCIPIO AFRICANUS THE YOUNGER, (died 129 B.C.),\r\ncaptured Carthage in the Third Punic War, and was leader of the\r\naristocratic party at Rome against the popular reforms of the Gracchi.\r\nHis works, of which only a few fragments survive, are praised by Cicero\r\nand were long held in esteem. GALBA, see note 87. PUBLIUS SULPICIUS\r\nRUFUS, (born 124; died 88 B.C.), was a tribune of the plebs. Cicero\r\nsays: “Of all the orators I ever heard, Sulpicius was the most\r\ndignified, and, so to speak, the most tragic.” CAIUS AURELIUS COTTA,\r\n(Consul 75 B.C.), is characterized by Cicero, who had argued a cause\r\nagainst him, as a most acute and subtle orator, but his style seems to\r\nhave been dry and unimpassioned. CAIUS SEMPRONIUS GRACCHUS, (died 121\r\nB.C.), a son of the famous Cornelia, and brother-in-law of Scipio\r\nAfricanus the Younger, is noted chiefly for his vain struggle in behalf\r\nof popular rights. Only fragments of his oratory have survived. MARCUS\r\nANTONIUS and CRASSUS, see note 85.\r\n\r\nNote 103 page 51. “In a certain place,” i.e., _De Oratore_, II, xxiii,\r\n97.\r\n\r\nNote 104 page 51.

Supino, of a medal, in the National Museum at\r\n    Florence, by Antonio del Pollaiuolo (1429-1498).\r\n\r\nNote 105 page 51. ANGELO POLIZIANO, (born 1454; died 1494), was a native\r\nof Montepulciano (about twenty-seven miles south-east of Siena), of\r\nwhich his name is a Latinized form. To English students he is better\r\nknown as POLITIAN, and as the author of the oft-cited line, “Tempora\r\nmutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.” His father Benedetto Ambrogini died\r\npoor, leaving a widow and five young children almost destitute. At the\r\nage of ten, Angelo studied at Florence, and composed Latin poems and\r\nGreek epigrams while yet a boy. At thirteen, he published Latin\r\nepistles; at sixteen, he began his Latin translation of the Iliad; at\r\nseventeen, he distributed Greek poems among the learned men of Florence;\r\nand at eighteen, he edited Catullus. He was received into Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici’s household, and before he was thirty years old, he was professor\r\nof Latin and Greek at the University of Florence and was entrusted with\r\nthe care of Lorenzo’s children. His pupils included the chief students\r\nof Europe. A born poet, entitled to the middle place of honour between\r\nPetrarch and Ariosto, he was the first Italian to combine perfect\r\nmastery of Latin and a correct sense of Greek with genius for his own\r\nnative literature. Towards the close of his life, he entered holy orders\r\nand became a canon of the Cathedral at Florence. He was ill formed, and\r\nhad squinting eyes and an enormous nose. His morals were lax. He was\r\nsucceeded by Bembo as dictator of Italian letters.\r\n\r\nNote 106 page 51. LORENZO DE' MEDICI, (born 1448; died 1492), was the\r\ngrandson of Cosimo, _Pater Patriæ_, and father of Giuliano of THE\r\nCOURTIER. On the death of his father Pietro in 1469, he succeeded\r\njointly with his brother Giuliano to the family wealth and political\r\npredominance. Giuliano’s assassination in the Piazzi conspiracy of 1478\r\n(which Poliziano witnessed and narrated in Latin) left Lorenzo sole\r\nruler, but like his predecessors, he governed the republic without any\r\ntitle, by free use of money and great adroitness in securing the\r\nelevation of his adherents to the chief offices of state. He was a man\r\nof marvellous range of mental power,—an epitome of Renaissance\r\nversatility. Never relaxing his hold on public affairs, among\r\nphilosophers he passed for a sage; among men of letters, for an original\r\nand graceful poet; among scholars, for a Hellenist sensitive to every\r\nnicety of Attic idiom; among artists, for a connoisseur of consummate\r\ntaste; among libertines, for a merry and untiring roysterer; among the\r\npious, for an accomplished theologian. “He was no less famous for his\r\njokes and repartees than for his pithy apothegms and maxims, as good a\r\njudge of cattle as of statues, as much at home in the bosom of his\r\nfamily as in the riot of an orgy, as ready to discourse on Plato as to\r\nplan a campaign or to plot the death of a dangerous citizen.” (Symonds.)\r\n\r\nNote 107 page 51. FRANCESCO CATTANI DA DIACCETO, (born 1466; died 1522),\r\nwas a native of Florence, studied at Pisa, and returning to his native\r\ncity became intimate with Ficino, of whose philosophy he may be said to\r\nhave been the heir. For many years he lectured at Florence with such\r\nsuccess that the Venetians tried to entice him to the University of\r\nPadua, in vain. A partisan of the Medici, he enjoyed the favour of Leo X\r\nand of Cardinal Giulio, afterwards Clement VII. All his works (written\r\nin Latin) are of a philosophical character. His style is said to be\r\nsprightly and correct, and despite the ridicule then cast upon the\r\nvulgar tongue, he himself translated several of his books into Italian,\r\nnotably the _Tre Libri d'Amore_, with which Castiglione shows\r\nfamiliarity in the Fourth Book of THE COURTIER.\r\n\r\nNote 108 page 52. CAIUS SILIUS ITALICUS, (died 100 A.D.), was Consul\r\nunder Nero and a follower of Cicero in the art of oratory. After a\r\nprosperous public career, he retired to a life of literary ease. His\r\nmost important work was a long epic poem on the Second Punic War, and\r\nsoon sank into oblivion. CORNELIUS TACITUS, (died probably after 117\r\nA.D.), was Consul and orator as well as historian.\r\n\r\nNote 109 page 54. MARCUS TERENTIUS VARRO, (born 116; died about 27\r\nB.C.), was somewhat older than Cæsar, Cicero and Sallust, but outlived\r\nthem all. He was regarded as the most learned of the Romans, and was\r\nmade director of the public library by Cæsar, although he had been a\r\npartisan of Pompey. Of his seventy-four works, which embraced nearly all\r\nbranches of knowledge, only two survive. They were much esteemed by the\r\nChristian Fathers.\r\n\r\nNote 110 page 55. CATULLUS was born about 87 B.C. His 39th ode begins:\r\n“Because Egnatius has white teeth, he smiles wherever he goes”\r\n(_Egnatius, quod candidos habet dentes, renidet usque quaque_). Later in\r\nthe same ode, he says: “Nothing is more pointless than a pointless\r\nlaugh” (_Nam risu inepto res ineptior nulla est_).\r\n\r\nNote 111 page 57. MONSEIGNEUR D'ANGOULÊME, afterwards FRANCIS I, (born\r\n1494; died 1547), was the son of Count Charles d'Angoulême and Louise of\r\nSavoy. His governor, Sieur de Boisy, strove to inspire him with a taste\r\nfor arms and a love of letters and art, and it was from romances of\r\nchivalry that he derived much of his education and many of his ideas of\r\ngovernment. He succeeded his cousin Louis XII in January 1515, and one\r\nof the earliest functions at his court was the marriage of his aunt\r\nFiliberta of Savoy to Giuliano de' Medici, who is here represented by\r\nCastiglione (with what truth remains uncertain) as having visited the\r\nFrench court shortly before the date of the Courtier dialogues. Writing\r\nin 1515, the Venetian ambassador describes the young king as being\r\nreally handsome (the evidence of our nearly contemporaneous medal\r\nillustration to the contrary), courageous, an excellent musician, and\r\nvery learned for one of his age and rank. Under his rule, relations\r\nbetween France and Italy became closer and more active, and there began\r\nto penetrate beyond the Alps that Italian influence which he later\r\ngreatly increased by marrying his son to Giuliano de' Medici’s\r\ngreat-niece Caterina. His education had included a study of Italian\r\nliterature and customs, and besides Federico Fregoso and Ludovico da\r\nCanossa he received and honoured many other illustrious Italians, among\r\nwhom were Leonardo da Vinci and Benvenuto Cellini. He caused search to\r\nbe made in Italy for rare MSS., and had them copied for his library. His\r\nreign, although clouded by defeats and humiliations, began a true\r\nliterary and artistic Renaissance in France.\r\n\r\nNote 112 page 57. The reference here is to the famous Sorbonne (founded\r\nby Robert Sorbon in 1253) towards which Francis was for religious\r\nreasons hostile during the early years of his reign, and to which he\r\nraised up a rival by founding the Collège de France in 1530.\r\n\r\nNote 113 page 58. LUCIUS LICINIUS LUCULLUS, a Roman general and Consul\r\n(74 B.C.), noted chiefly for his wealth, luxury, and patronage of art\r\nand letters. LUCIUS CORNELIUS SULLA, a Roman general, Consul (88 B.C.),\r\nand dictator, was the first Roman to lead an army against the city, and\r\nthe first to publish lists of his enemies, proscribing them and offering\r\na reward for their death. CNEIUS POMPEIUS, or POMPEY, (born 106; died 48\r\nB.C.), a member of the Triumvirate with Cæsar and Crassus, and the\r\nfinally unsuccessful champion of the conservative party against the\r\npower of Cæsar. MARCUS JUNIUS BRUTUS, (born 85; died 42 B.C.), a\r\nstatesman and scholar, who adhered to Pompey, joined Cassius in the\r\nassassination of Cæsar, and was finally defeated by Mark Antony.\r\nHANNIBAL, (born 247 B.C.), the famous Carthaginian general who conquered\r\nSpain, crossed the Alps, overran Italy, was defeated by Scipio the\r\nElder, became chief magistrate of Carthage, and committed suicide in\r\nexile about 183 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 114 page 59. In the last chapter of his “Prince,” Machiavelli (who\r\nwas Castiglione’s contemporary) says: “Although military excellence\r\nseems to be extinct in Italy, this arises from the fact that the old\r\nmethods were not good and there has been no one who knew how to devise\r\nnew ones. We have great excellence in the members, if only it were not\r\nlacking in the heads. In duels and engagements between small numbers,\r\nsee how superior the Italians are in strength, in dexterity, in\r\nresource. But when it comes to armies, they make no showing; and it all\r\nproceeds from the weakness of the heads. Whence it arises that in so\r\nmuch time, in so many battles fought in the last twenty years, when an\r\narmy has been purely Italian, it has always succeeded ill.” Compare this\r\nopinion with Montaigne’s remark (_Essais_, II, c. 24) that the officers\r\nof Charles VIII ascribed their easy Italian conquests to the fact that\r\n“the princes and nobility of Italy took more pleasure in becoming\r\ningenious and learned than in becoming vigorous and warlike.”\r\n\r\nNote 115 page 59. In 1524 Castiglione wrote to his mother at Mantua\r\nregarding the education of his son, who had just begun to study the\r\nGreek alphabet, as follows: “As to Camillo’s learning Greek, I have had\r\na letter also from Michael, who says so many things that he seems to me\r\na flatterer. It is enough that the boy shows good capacity and\r\ninclination, and good pronunciation. As for Latin, I should be glad to\r\nhave him attend more to Greek at present, for those who know are of\r\nopinion that one ought to begin with Greek; because Latin is natural to\r\nus, and we almost acquire it even though we spend little labour upon it;\r\nbut Greek is not so.”\r\n\r\nNote 116 page 59. The reader will hardly need to be reminded that the\r\nhabit of versification was very prevalent in all ranks of Italian\r\nsociety in Castiglione’s day. Varchi (1502-1565) informs us that the\r\nvernacular was generally despised in the Florence of that time, and\r\nadds: “And I remember, when I was a lad, that the first and most\r\nimportant command which fathers usually gave to their children, and\r\nmasters to their pupils, was that they must on no account whatever read\r\nanything in the vulgar tongue.”\r\n\r\nNote 117 page 59. In the _Vita Nuova_ (c. 25), Dante says: “And the\r\nfirst who began to speak like a native poet was moved thereto because he\r\nwould have his words understood of woman.”\r\n\r\nNote 118 page 59. ARISTIPPUS, (_flor._ 400 B.C.), was a Greek\r\nphilosopher, whose school took its name from his birthplace, Cyrene in\r\nAfrica. He was for some time a follower of Socrates, and afterwards\r\nlived at the court of Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse. Diogenes Laertius\r\nrelates that when Aristippus was asked what was the greatest thing he\r\nhad gained from philosophy, he replied: “The power to meet all men with\r\nconfidence.”\r\n\r\nNote 119 page 60. Among Plutarch’s works is a tract entitled “How to\r\nTell Friend from Flatterer.” In 1532 Erasmus published a Latin version\r\nof it dedicated to Henry VIII of England.\r\n\r\nNote 120 page 61. The first quatrain of a well-known sonnet by Petrarch:\r\n\r\n               _Giunto Alessandro alla famosa tomba\r\n                 Del fero Achille, sospirando disse:\r\n                 O fortunato, cite sì chiara tromba\r\n                 Trovasti, e chi di te sì alto scrisse!_\r\n\r\nof which Mr. John Jay Chapman has kindly furnished the following\r\ntranslation:\r\n\r\n           When Alexander reached the sacred mound\r\n             Where dread Achilles sleeps, “O child of Fame,”\r\n             He sighed. “Thy deeds are happy that they found\r\n             Old Homer’s tongue to clarion thy name.”\r\n\r\nIn his oration _Pro Archia_, Cicero describes Alexander as exclaiming:\r\n“O fortunate youth, who found Homer as herald of thy valour!” (_O\r\nfortunate, inquit, adulescens qui tuæ virtutis Homerum præconem\r\ninveneris!_).\r\n\r\nNote 121 page 62. In an earlier version, this passage reads: “Grasso de'\r\nMedici will in this matter have the same advantage over Messer Pietro\r\nBembo that a hogshead has over a barrel.” Bembo was slender, while\r\n_Grasso_ (fat man) was probably the nickname of a corpulent soldier in\r\nthe service of the Medici, possibly identical with a certain Grasso to\r\nwhom Bembo desired to be commended in a letter to Bibbiena, 5 February\r\n1506.\r\n\r\nNote 122 page 63. The instrument used in Socrates’s time κιθάρα was\r\ncertainly not the modern cithern, but more probably a kind of large\r\nlyre, supported by a ribbon and played with a plectrum of metal, wood or\r\nivory.\r\n\r\nNote 123 page 63. In a note to this passage, Cian says: “_Abito_\r\n[rendered ‘habit of mind’] is a special condition or habitual quality of\r\nthe mind, which manifests itself outwardly in a special _costume_\r\n[rendered ‘habitual tendency’], or equally habitual behaviour, which in\r\nturn reacts upon the disposition and moral attitude of the individual.”\r\n\r\nNote 124 page 64.

Castiglione doubtless had in mind the legend of Arion,\r\na Greek poet of Lesbos, who probably flourished about 700 B.C. We have a\r\nfragment of his verse addressed to Poseidon and telling of the dolphins,\r\nwho had wafted the poet safely to land when he had lost his course.\r\n\r\nNote 130 page 65. As we shall see, the Magnifico’s request was not\r\ncomplied with until the second evening (page 81).\r\n\r\nNote 131 page 65. QUINTUS FABIUS PICTOR was a Roman general who served\r\nin the Second Punic War, and wrote a Greek history of Rome, much\r\nesteemed by the ancients, but now lost. Pliny affirms that Fabius\r\npainted the temple in the 450th year after the founding of Rome (i.e.\r\n300 B.C.), and that the painting was still extant about the beginning of\r\nour era.\r\n\r\nNote 132 page 66. The Apollo Belvedere was discovered in 1503, the\r\nLaocoön group in 1506, and other famous antique statues only a few years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nNote 133 page 66. The comparative merits of painting and sculpture were\r\na frequent subject of discussion during this period. The Renaissance\r\nwriters had inherited from antiquity a fondness for seeking superiority\r\nor inferiority in matters between which there exists such a diversity of\r\ncharacter as to render comparison unprofitable. According to Vasari,\r\nGiorgione maintained “that in one picture the painter could display\r\nvarious aspects without the necessity of walking round his work, and\r\ncould even display, at one glance, all the different aspects that could\r\nbe presented by the figure of a man, even though the latter should\r\nassume several attitudes,—a thing which could not be accomplished by\r\nsculpture without compelling the observer to change his place, so that\r\nthe work is not presented at one view, but at different views. He\r\ndeclared, further, that he could execute a single figure in painting, in\r\nsuch a manner as to show the front, back, and profiles of both sides at\r\none and the same time.... He painted a nude figure, with its back turned\r\nto the spectator, and at the feet of the figure was a limpid stream,\r\nwherein the reflection of the front was painted with the utmost\r\nexactitude: on one side was a highly burnished corselet, of which the\r\nfigure had divested itself, and wherein the left side was reflected\r\nperfectly, every part of the figure being clearly apparent: and on the\r\nother side was a mirror, in which the right profile of the nude form was\r\nalso exhibited. By this beautiful and admirable fancy, Giorgione desired\r\nto prove that painting is, in effect, the superior art, requiring more\r\ntalent and demanding higher effort.”\r\n\r\nIn one of his letters, Michelangelo wrote: “My opinion is that all\r\npainting is the better the nearer it approaches to relief, and relief is\r\nworse in proportion as it inclines to painting. And so I have been wont\r\nto think that sculpture is the lamp of painting, and that the difference\r\nbetween them might be likened to the difference between the sun and\r\nmoon.... By sculpture I understand an art which operates by taking away\r\nsuperfluous material; by painting, one that attains its result by laying\r\nmaterial on. It is enough that both emanate from the same human\r\nintelligence, and consequently sculpture and painting ought to live in\r\namity together, without these lengthy disputations. More time is wasted\r\nin talking about the problem than would go to the making of figures in\r\nboth species.”\r\n\r\nNote 134 page 68. In his “Treatise on Painting,” Leonardo da Vinci says:\r\n“The first marvel we find in painting is the apparent detachment from\r\nthe wall or other plane, and the cheating of keen perceptions by\r\nsomething that is not separate from the surface.”\r\n\r\nNote 135 page 68. “Grottoes,” i.e. the Catacombs. Speaking in his\r\nautobiography of the remains of ancient art found in the Catacombs,\r\nBenvenuto Cellini says: “These grotesques have received this name from\r\nthe moderns because they were found by scholars at Rome in certain\r\nsubterranean caverns, which had anciently been rooms, chambers, studios,\r\nhalls and the like. Since these scholars found them in these cavernous\r\nplaces (which had been built by the ancients on the surface and had\r\nbecome low), and since such low places are known at Rome by the name\r\nGrottoes, for that reason they received the name grotesques.” Cellini\r\nhere tries to explain the origin of the name applied to ornaments (such\r\nas the arabesques of the Renaissance) in which figures, human to the\r\nwaist, terminate in scrolls, leafage, etc., and are combined with animal\r\nforms and impossible flowers. In this sense the word was used as early\r\nas 1502 in a contract between the Cardinal of Siena and the painter\r\nPinturicchio. It had of course not yet reached its modern signification,\r\nso fully discussed in the appendix to Volume IV of Ruskin’s “Modern\r\nPainters.” In Castiglione’s time it was not known that the catacomb\r\ndecorations were Christian, and in any case they were founded on pagan\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nNote 136 page 69. DEMETRIUS I of Macedon, (died 283 B.C.), was the son\r\nof Antigonus, who was one of Alexander’s most illustrious generals and\r\nsucceeded to the Macedonian throne.\r\n\r\nNote 137 page 69. Of METRODORUS, nothing more is known than Pliny’s\r\naccount of the incident recorded in our text.\r\n\r\nNote 138 page 69. LUCIUS ÆMILIUS PAULUS, (died 160 B.C.), was a Roman\r\ngeneral, Consul, and statesman of the aristocratic party. The incident\r\nmentioned in the text occurred after his victory over King Perseus of\r\nMacedon in 168 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 139 page 70. CAMPASPE, according to Pliny, was the name of the\r\nbeautiful slave given by Alexander to Apelles, as narrated at page 68.\r\n\r\nNote 140 page 70. ZEUXIS, (_flor._ 400 B.C.), belonged to the Ionian\r\nschool of Greek painting, which was characterized by sensuous beauty and\r\naccurate imitation of nature. He lived at Athens, and his idealism is\r\nsaid to have been rather of form than of character. The picture referred\r\nto in the text represented Helen of Troy, was regarded as his\r\nmasterpiece, and was probably identical with a picture mentioned as\r\nbeing at Rome. The story of the five maidens is said to have been cited\r\nby Tintoretto in support of his maxim, “Art must perfect Nature.”\r\n\r\nNote 141 page 71. The Marquesses FEBUS and GERARDINO DI CEVA were sons\r\nof the Marquess Giovanni (who was living as late as 1491), and belonged\r\nto one of the most illustrious families of Piedmont and indeed of all\r\nItaly. They were born towards the close of the 15th century and died\r\nabout the third decade of the 16th, having obtained the investiture of\r\ntheir fief in 1521. They sided sometimes with the Emperor and sometimes\r\nwith France, as best suited them, and left rather a bad name. To escape\r\npunishment for killing a cousin, Gerardino stabbed himself, and Febus\r\nalso died “_disperato_,” leaving two daughters in grief and shame.\r\n\r\nNote 142 page 71. ETTORE ROMANO GIOVENALE was a cavalier of whom little\r\nmore is known than that he was in Francesco Maria’s service, fought\r\nsuccessfully as one of the thirteen Italian champions at Barletta, was\r\nafterwards in the service of the Duke of Ferrara, who dismissed him for\r\nan act of treachery.\r\n\r\nNote 143 page 71. COLLO VINCENZO CALMETA of Castelnuovo, (died 1508),\r\nwas a courtly poet and prose writer, who had been secretary to the\r\nDuchess Beatrice d'Este of Milan. Later he enjoyed the especial favour\r\nof this lady’s sister, the Marchioness Isabella d'Este of Mantua, and\r\nalso of the Duchess of Urbino, who protected him from the displeasure of\r\nher brother the Marquess of Mantua, and at whose court he improvised\r\nverse somewhat after the manner of the Unico Aretino. In a letter (1504)\r\nfrom Urbino to Isabella d'Este, Emilia Pia wrote: “Of news here there is\r\nnone that is not known to you, except that Calmeta is continually\r\ncomposing songs and divers other things, and this carnival has written a\r\nnew comedy, which he would have sent you if he had thought it would give\r\nyou pleasure.” Among Calmeta’s works were a verse compendium of Ovid’s\r\n_Ars Amandi_, and a biography of his friend and fellow improvisatore,\r\nSerafino Ciminelli d'Aquila (see note 255). As known to us, his poetical\r\nwritings do not rise above mediocrity, and wholly fail to explain the\r\nesteem in which they were held.\r\n\r\nNote 144 page 71. ORAZIO FLORIDO was a native of Fano, one of the\r\nAdriatic coast towns nearest to Urbino. Having been chancellor to Duke\r\nGuidobaldo, he became secretary to Duke Francesco Maria. When Francesco\r\nwas combating the usurper Lorenzo de' Medici in 1517, he sent one of his\r\nofficers with Florido under protection of a safe-conduct to challenge\r\nLorenzo to personal combat. In spite of the safe-conduct, Florido was\r\ndetained and sent to Leo X at Rome, where he was basely tortured in the\r\nhope of extorting political secrets from him. He remained steadfastly\r\nfaithful to his master, and afterwards made a tour of the courts of\r\nEurope seeking aid for his lord.\r\n\r\nNote 145 page 73. MARGARITA GONZAGA was a niece of the Duchess of\r\nUrbino, being a natural daughter of the Marquess Gianfrancesco of\r\nMantua. She was for many years one of the ornaments of the Urbino court.\r\nVarious mentions of her in contemporary letters show her as a woman of\r\nunusual beauty, sprightly wit and gay disposition. She had several\r\nsuitors, apparently including Filippo Beroaldo, who is mentioned later\r\nin THE COURTIER (page 139).\r\n\r\nNote 146 page 73. Of BARLETTA nothing more is known than what is\r\ncontained in this and another shorter mention of him in THE COURTIER\r\n(page 87).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BEATRICE D'ESTE\r\n  DUCHESS OF MILAN\r\n  1475-1497\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 42.371) of the portrait, in the\r\n    Pitti Gallery at Florence, attributed to Piero della Francesca\r\n    (1420-1492).

The original reads: _havendo prima danzato una bassa,\r\nballarono una Roegarze_. The _danza bassa_ was of Spanish origin and is\r\nbelieved to have consisted of sliding steps and of posturing, in which\r\nthe feet were not lifted. The verb _ballare_ seems to be derived from\r\nthe low Latin _balla_, a ball. In the Middle Ages the game of ball was\r\naccompanied with dance and song, and we may well believe that a class of\r\ndances, thus originating and denominated generally _balli_, were more\r\nanimated than the _danza bassa_. Although a Greek derivation has been\r\nascribed to the word _roegarze_, Cian affirms that the dance thus named\r\nwas of French origin. The earliest French translator of THE COURTIER\r\nrenders the word by _rouergoise_, which is apparently derived from\r\n_Rouergue_, the name of an ancient French province to the south-west of\r\nLyons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FILIPPO MARIA VISCONTI\r\n  DUKE OF MILAN\r\n  1391-1447\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Giraudon’s photograph (no. 254) of a drawing, in the\r\n    Louvre, by Vittore Pisano, better known as Pisanello, (1380?-1451?).\r\n\r\n\r\n                NOTES TO THE SECOND BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n\r\nNote 148 page 75. This passage reflects the medico-philosophical\r\ntheories which the Renaissance inherited from antiquity, and which\r\nregarded “the vital spirits” as something far more tangible and material\r\nthan what we call the principle of life or vital spark. Compare the\r\nearly conception of electricity as a fluid substance. “Complexion” is of\r\ncourse here used to mean temperament or constitution, and not the mere\r\ncolour and texture of the skin.\r\n\r\nNote 149 page 77. Duke FILIPPO MARIA VISCONTI, (born 1391; died 1447),\r\nwas the son of Giangaleotto and Caterina Visconti, and brother of\r\nGiovanni Maria Visconti, whom he succeeded as Duke of Milan in 1412. He\r\nmarried Beatrice di Tenda (widow of Facino Cane), who brought him nearly\r\na half million of florins dowry, besides her husband’s soldiers and\r\ncities, and thus enabled him gradually to win back the Lombard part of\r\nhis father’s duchy, which his brother had lost. He was very ugly in\r\nperson, and so sensitive that he rarely appeared in public. Wily but\r\nunstable, he was continually plotting schemes that seemed to have no\r\nobject, and he mistrusted his own generals, even Francesco Sforza, who\r\nturned against him, forced him to a ruinous peace, and after his death\r\nwas soon able to seize his duchy. In him the cruel selfishness of the\r\nRenaissance tyrant did not degenerate into mad thirst for blood, as in\r\nthe case of his terrible brother. He read Dante, Petrarch and French\r\nromances of chivalry, and even dallied with the Latin classics, but\r\ngenuine learning was neglected and despised at his court.\r\n\r\nDuke BORSO D'ESTE, (born 1413; died 1471), like his brother and\r\npredecessor, was a natural son of Duke Niccolò III. Kindly and just, he\r\nwas idolized by the Ferrarese and especially by the women. He patronized\r\nletters and art and was fond of splendid living, yet in spite of the\r\nluxury of his court, he left a treasure of about a million pounds\r\nsterling. The art of printing was established at Ferrara shortly before\r\nhis death. He appears to have been himself ignorant of Latin, and\r\nencouraged the literary use of Italian and the study of French romance.\r\nHistories of Ferrara, as well as the writings of contemporary humanists,\r\nare full of his generous deeds. His mild sway passed into a proverb, and\r\nthe time of “the good Duke Borso” was long remembered as a kind of\r\ngolden age.\r\n\r\nNote 150 page 77. NICCOLῸ PICCININO, (born 1380; died 1444), was so\r\nhumbly born as to possess no other surname than that conferred on him in\r\nridicule of his small stature. Having served under the famous Braccio da\r\nMontone, he married the latter’s niece, and achieved such distinction as\r\na soldier as to share with Francesco Sforza the fame of being the first\r\n_condottiere_ of his day. He became the friend and general of Duke\r\nFederico of Urbino. His rough wit was highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nNote 151 page 77. This consciousness of the corruption then prevailing\r\nin Italy is even more frankly expressed by Machiavelli: “It is but too\r\ntrue that we Italians are in a special degree irreligious and corrupt.”\r\n(_Discorsi_, I, 12.)\r\n\r\nNote 152 page 78. The reference here is to Plato’s _Phædo_, c. 3.\r\nSocrates is said to have turned Æsop’s fables into verse.\r\n\r\nNote 153 page 83. The Italian noun _fierezza_ (rendered “boldness”) and\r\nthe adjective _fiero_ (more anciently _fero_, the epithet applied by\r\nPetrarch to Achilles, see note 120) are derived from the Latin _ferus_\r\n(wild, untamed, impetuous), the root of which we see in our English word\r\n_fer_ocious. While retaining its etymological signification, _fiero_ was\r\nused to mean also: haughty, intrepid, strong, sturdy.\r\n\r\nNote 154 page 87. “Brawls” (Italian, _brandi_; French, _branles_) were a\r\nkind of animated figured dance, said to be of Spanish origin and to have\r\nresembled the modern _cotillon_. A letter by Castiglione mentions this\r\ndance as having been performed by figures dressed as birds in one of the\r\ninterludes when Bibbiena’s _Calandra_ was first presented at Urbino.\r\nThis and other passages suggest that the use of masks was even more\r\ncommon in Italian society of the author’s time, than at the present day.\r\n\r\nNote 155 page 88. Castiglione’s letters show that he possessed and\r\nplayed upon a variety of musical instruments, and it is known that in\r\nDuke Federico’s time, the palace of Urbino was well supplied with\r\ninstruments and musicians.\r\n\r\nNote 156 page 88. Viol is the generic name for the family of bowed\r\ninstruments that succeeded the mediæval fiddle and preceded the violin.\r\nInvented in the 15th century, it differed from a violin in having deeper\r\nribs, a flat back, and a broad centre-piece on which the sound post\r\nrested. Its neck was broad and thin; it had from five to seven strings,\r\nand was made in four sizes, of which the lowest pitched (the _violone_\r\nor double bass) is still in use. The tone of the instrument is said to\r\nhave been penetrating rather than powerful.\r\n\r\nNote 157 page 89. Wind instruments, and especially the flute, are here\r\nreferred to. According to Plutarch, Alcibiades maintained that they were\r\nregarded with disfavour by Pallas and Apollo because the face is\r\ndistorted in playing upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NICCOLÒ PICCININO\r\n  1380-1444\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Giraudon’s photograph (no. 252) of a drawing, in the\r\n    Louvre, by Vittore Pisano, better known as Pisanello, (1380?-1451?).\r\n\r\nNote 158 page 90. The Pythagoreans supposed the intervals between the\r\nheavenly bodies to be determined by the laws of musical harmony. Hence\r\narose the celebrated doctrine of “the music of the spheres” (already\r\nreferred to by Castiglione in the text, page 63); for in their motion\r\nthe heavenly bodies must each occasion a certain sound or note depending\r\non their distances and velocities, which notes together formed a musical\r\nharmony, inaudible to man because he has been accustomed to it from the\r\nfirst and has never had an opportunity to contrast it with silence, or\r\nbecause it exceeds his powers of hearing. Pythagoras himself (died about\r\n500 B.C.) taught his disciples to sing to the accompaniment of the lyre,\r\nand to chaunt hymns to the gods and to virtuous men.\r\n\r\nNote 159 page 90. As the Italian commentator, Count Vesme, suggests, the\r\nauthor may have meant to say, “shave twice a day.” A weekly visit to the\r\nbarber may, however, have been usually regarded as sufficient at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNote 160 page 93. In the beginning of his Encomium on Folly (which was\r\nwell known in Italy when Castiglione wrote THE COURTIER), Erasmus\r\npretends that, “although there has been no lack of those who, at great\r\ncost of oil and sleep, have exalted ... the fourth-day ague, the fly,\r\nand baldness, with most tedious praise,” Folly is languishing without a\r\neulogist. Among the works of Lucian (_flor._ 160 A.D.) there is a brief\r\nhumourous book in praise of the fly; the philosopher Favorinus (_flor._\r\n120 A.D.) is said to have written a eulogy on the fourth-day ague; and\r\nthere is another on baldness by the early Christian writer, Synesius\r\n(_flor._ 400 A.D.). The men of the Renaissance delighted in similar\r\ndisplays of wit.\r\n\r\nNote 161 page 94. The Italian _procella_ (rendered ‘fury’) primarily\r\nmeans a tempest, and is so translated in the earliest French and English\r\nversions of THE COURTIER (_estourbillon_, storm). The still earlier\r\nSpanish version has _pestilencia_.\r\n\r\nNote 162 page 95. The Italian _impedito_ (rendered ‘palsied’) literally\r\nmeans entangled as to the feet.\r\n\r\nNote 163 page 96.

TITUS MANLIUS,—called TORQUATUS from the chain\r\n(_torques_) that he took from the body of a gigantic Gaul whom he had\r\nslain in single combat,—was a favourite hero of Roman story. The\r\nincident referred to here occurred shortly before a Roman victory over\r\nthe Latins at the foot of Vesuvius. Manlius and his colleague in command\r\nhad proclaimed that no Roman might engage a Latin singly on pain of\r\ndeath, but a son of Manlius accepted a challenge from one of the enemy,\r\nslew his adversary, and bore the bloody spoils in triumph to his father,\r\nwho thereupon caused the young man to be put to death before the\r\nassembled army. Manlius was Consul in 340 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 166 page 101. PUBLIUS LICINIUS CRASSUS MUCIANUS was Roman Consul in\r\n131 B.C. According to Livy, the incident narrated in the text occurred\r\nduring an unsuccessful campaign against Pergamus, which ended in\r\nCrassus’s voluntary death.\r\n\r\nNote 167 page 103. Rome was sacked only the year before THE COURTIER was\r\nfirst published. Italy had become the plaything of foreign conquest.\r\n\r\nNote 168 page 103. DARIUS III was King of Persia 336-330 B.C. This story\r\nabout his sword seems to be founded on the following passage in Quintus\r\nCurtius Rufus’s History of Alexander the Great: “At the beginning of his\r\nreign, Darius ordered his Persian scabbard to be altered to the form\r\nwhich the Greeks used; whereupon the Chaldeans prophesied that the\r\nempire of the Persians would pass to those whose arms he had imitated.”\r\n\r\nNote 169 page 104.

The Italian phrase here rendered ‘goes against the\r\ngrain’ is _non gli avrà sangue_ (more usually _non ci avrà il suo\r\nsangue_), and might be more precisely translated ‘will not suit his\r\nhumour.’ The ‘as we say’ suggests that the idiom was of recent origin in\r\nCastiglione’s time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAXIMILIAN I\r\n  EMPEROR OF GERMANY\r\n  1459-1519\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 34.074) of the portrait, in the\r\n    Imperial Museum at Vienna, by Ambrogio da Predis (_flor._ 1500).

GIACOPO SANNAZARO, (born 1458; died 1530), was a\r\nnative of Naples, and the son of Giacopo Niccolò and Masella di San\r\nMagno. His boyhood was spent with his mother at San Cipriano, near her\r\nbirthplace Salerno. He soon made such progress in Latin and Greek that\r\nhe was admitted to the academy of the famous Pontormo, of whom he became\r\nthe close friend. Their effigies may be seen together in the Neapolitan\r\nchurch of Monte Oliveto. He received a villa and a pension from the\r\nscholarly Aragonese dynasty, to which he remained faithful with pen and\r\nsword, following Federico III into exile (see note 401) in 1501, and\r\nreturning to Naples only after his king’s death in 1504. He seems to\r\nhave had a peaceful and honourable old age, active in works of piety and\r\ncharity, and employing his leisure in study and in the society of a\r\ncertain noble lady for whom he had formed a lasting Platonic friendship.\r\nHis writings include marine eclogues, elegies, etc., in Latin, but his\r\nbest known work is _L'Arcadia_, an Italian prose romance interspersed\r\nwith verse, of which sixty editions are said to have appeared before\r\n1600. It is regarded by Mahaffy as having originated the idea that the\r\nGreek Arcadia was the especial home of pastoral poetry, and probably\r\nserved Sidney as a model for his poem of the same name. Hardly less\r\nfamous were Sannazaro’s anti-Borgian epigrams, to which Symonds ascribes\r\nno small part of the gruesome legend of Lucrezia’s crimes. He was buried\r\nin a church built by him near the so-called tomb of Virgil, and his\r\nmonument behind the high altar bears the Latin inscription by Bembo, in\r\nwhich he is described as “near alike to Virgil’s muse and sepulchre.”\r\n\r\nNote 176 page 113. Motet is “a term which for the last three hundred\r\nyears has been almost exclusively applied to certain pieces of church\r\nmusic, of moderate length, adapted to Latin words (selected, for the\r\nmost part, either from Holy Scripture, or the Roman office-books), and\r\nintended to be sung at high mass, either in place of, or immediately\r\nafter, the Plain Chaunt _Offertorium_ of the Day.“ (Grove.) The motet\r\nwas sometimes founded on the air of some non-sacred song, as in the case\r\nof Josquin’s _Stabat Mater_, which was based upon the ballad _Comme\r\nFemme_. (Ambros.)\r\n\r\nNote 177 page 113. JOSQUIN (more properly JOSSE) DE PRÈS, (born about\r\n1450; died 1521), seems to have been a native of St. Quentin, Hainault,\r\nBelgium, and was one of the celebrated musicians of the Renaissance.\r\nHaving been the pupil of Ockenheim, the greatest composer of the day, he\r\nwas at the papal court of Sixtus IV, and successively in the service of\r\nLorenzo de' Medici, Louis XII of France, and the Emperor Maximilian I.\r\nHe returned to Italy about 1503 and lived at the court of Ferrara. He is\r\nthe earliest composer whose works are preserved in such quantity as\r\nadequately to present his power, and was called “the father of harmony”\r\nby Dr. Burney. Music began to be printed (1498) when Josquin was in his\r\nprime.\r\n\r\nNote 178 page 114. Other contemporary evidence amply confirms this\r\naccount of the occasional grossness that marked the table manners of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNote 179 page 115. The two princes here referred to are Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic of Spain (see note 392) and Louis XII of France (see note 250).\r\n\r\nNote 180 page 116. PAOLO NICCOLÒ VERNIA, called NICOLETTO (little Nick)\r\nfrom his shortness of stature, (died 1499), was a native of Chieti, near\r\nthe Adriatic. He probably studied at Padua, and remained there teaching\r\nphysics, although in 1444 he took his degree in philosophy, and fourteen\r\nyears later in medicine. He wrote chiefly on philosophy, but was noted\r\nalso as a wit.\r\n\r\nNote 181 page 116. “When Frederick Barbarossa attempted to govern the\r\nrebellious Lombard cities in the common interest of the Empire, he\r\nestablished in their midst a foreign judge, called ‘Podestà,’ _quasi\r\nhabens potestatem Imperatoris in hac parte_.... The title of ‘Podestà’\r\nwas subsequently conferred upon the official summoned to maintain an\r\nequal balance between the burghers and the nobles.” Symonds’s\r\n“Renaissance in Italy,” ed. 1883, i, 61.\r\n\r\nNote 182 page 117. This was the battle of Fornovo (6 July 1495), in\r\nwhich the Italian forces under the Marquess Gianfrancesco Gonzaga of\r\nMantua failed to prevent the retreat of Charles VIII towards France.\r\nBoth sides claimed a victory, and the marquess even went so far as to\r\nhave it commemorated by Mantegna in a picture, “The Madonna of Victory”\r\n(Louvre), which contains his portrait. Castiglione’s father died from\r\nthe effect of wounds received in this battle.\r\n\r\nNote 183 page 117. The reference here is plainly to Leonardo da Vinci\r\n(see note 96). His contemporaries would naturally regard as chimerical\r\nsuch devices as steam cannon, paddle wheels for boats, and flying\r\nmachines, or such hints as that contained in his _Codex Atlanticus_,\r\nwhere he suggests the possibility of steam navigation. “He was the first\r\nto explain correctly the dim illumination seen over the rest of the\r\nsurface of the moon when the bright part is only a thin crescent. He\r\npointed out that when the moon was nearly new, the half of the earth\r\nwhich was then illuminated by the sun was turned nearly directly towards\r\nthe moon, and that the moon was in consequence illuminated slightly by\r\nthis ‘earthshine,’ just as we are by moonshine. This explanation ...\r\ntended to break down the supposed barrier between terrestrial and\r\ncelestial bodies.” Arthur Berry’s “Short History of Astronomy” (London,\r\n1898), p. 91.\r\n\r\nNote 184 page 118. Suetonius mentions this characteristic of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nNote 185 page 119. This is one of the few passages in The Courtier that\r\nare plainly reminiscent of Dante, who says: “To that truth which hath\r\nthe face of falsehood, man must ever close his lips” (_Sempre a quel ver\r\nche ha faccia di menzogna, De' l’uom chiuder la labbra_). _Inferno_,\r\nxvi, 124-5.\r\n\r\nNote 186 page 121. The translator admits being at a loss to find an\r\nadequate equivalent for the Italian _argusie_. Our unfamiliar English\r\nadjective ‘argute’ suggests that kind of pungent and witty conceits\r\nwhich Castiglione is describing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARLES VIII OF FRANCE\r\n  1470-1498\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Alinari’s photograph (no. 2749) of the anonymous bronze\r\n    bust in the National Museum at Florence. See note 388.\r\n\r\nNote 187 page 121. Bibbiena’s reputation as a wit was well established,\r\nwhile Canossa seems also to have deserved the same epithet, if we may\r\njudge from a story that has been preserved of him. The count had at Rome\r\na fine collection of silver plate, including a flagon with a lid in the\r\nform of a tiger. A friend having borrowed this flagon and kept it for\r\ntwo months, returned it only on demand and with the request that the\r\ncount lend him a certain salt-cellar, which had a crab for a cover.\r\nLudovico sent word that if the tiger, which is the swiftest of beasts,\r\nhad been two months coming home, the crab, being slower than all others,\r\nwould by the same rule be absent for years, and that on this account he\r\nwas unwilling to let it go.\r\n\r\nNote 188 page 122. The allusion is of course to Bibbiena’s early\r\nbaldness.\r\n\r\nNote 189 page 122. Cardinal GALEOTTO DELLA ROVERE, (born about 1477;\r\ndied 1508), was the favourite nephew of Julius II, being a son of the\r\npope’s sister Luchina by her first husband Gianfrancesco Franciotti, a\r\npatrician of Lucca. Like all his mother’s other children, he was adopted\r\nas of the della Rovere name. Having been made Bishop of Lucca, he was\r\ncreated a cardinal on his uncle’s election as pope, appointed pontifical\r\nvice-chancellor, and soon given a great number of benefices. Generous\r\nand amiable, and a patron of artists and authors, he was much beloved at\r\nthe court of Urbino, as is shown by several documents, among which is a\r\nletter by Emilia Pia mentioning two sonnets of his, in one of which\r\n(written the day before his last illness) he foretold his early death.\r\n\r\nNote 190 page 123. GIACOMO SANSECONDO, a noted musician who flourished\r\nbetween the years 1493 and 1522 at the courts of Milan, Mantua, Ferrara,\r\nUrbino and Rome, where he attained a wide celebrity in the pontificate\r\nof Leo X. He seems to have ended his days in adversity, in some degree\r\nrelieved by his friend Castiglione, whose letters contain several\r\naffectionate mentions of him.\r\n\r\nNote 191 page 124. DEMOCRITUS, (_flor._ 400 B.C.), was the atomistic\r\nphilosopher of Abdera in Thrace. He possessed an ample fortune, and his\r\ncheerful disposition led him to look on the bright and humourous side of\r\nthings, a fact taken by later writers to mean that he laughed at the\r\nfollies of mankind.\r\n\r\nNote 192 page 125. The phrase ‘served her in love’ and the conventional\r\nrelation that it denoted, were drawn from mediæval life and literature\r\nnorth of the Alps, and with some changes survived in Italy during the\r\nRenaissance, until the _cavalier servente_ became in the 18th century a\r\nrecognized institution. Attendance upon the lady at church was a\r\ncharacteristic feature of the cavalier’s service.\r\n\r\nNote 193 page 126. PIUS III, Francesco Todeschini, (born 1439; died\r\n1503), was a native of Siena and a nephew of the illustrious Æneas\r\nSilvius Piccolomini (Pius II). The suddenness of his predecessor\r\nAlexander VI's death took the sacred college by surprise, and they\r\nunanimously elected their weakest member as pope. His short pontificate\r\nof twenty-six days was filled with disturbances, and he was believed to\r\nhave died from poison.\r\n\r\nNote 194 page 126. ANTONIO AGNELLO, (died after 1527), belonged to one\r\nof the most noted families of Mantua, and seems to have been the son of\r\nGiulio Agnello and Margarita Crema. Besides being an able man of affairs\r\n(employed by the Palæologus rulers of Montferrat), he was a graceful\r\npoet, and became the friend of Bembo and Castiglione.\r\n\r\nNote 195 page 126. The poet CAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS, (born about 87\r\nB.C.), was a native of Verona and a friend of Cæsar and Cicero. His\r\nextant works include one hundred and sixteen poems, lyric, epigrammatic,\r\nelegiac, etc. His 69th Ode is a dialogue between the author and a door.\r\n\r\nNote 196 page 127. Pope NICHOLAS V, Tommaso Parentucelli, (born 1398;\r\ndied 1455), was a native of Pisa, whence his family were exiled in his\r\ninfancy. Although his father died when he was nine years old, and in\r\nspite of great poverty, he contrived to study at the University of\r\nBologna. Later he served as tutor in the Albizzi and Strozzi families at\r\nFlorence, thus earning enough money to return and take his theological\r\ndegree at Bologna. He then entered the service of the archbishop of the\r\nlatter city, whom he accompanied to Florence, and there became a friend\r\nof Cosimo de' Medici and a member of the literary society of the place.\r\nIn 1443 he was made Bishop of Bologna, and four years later was elected\r\npope, an elevation that he owed solely to his reputation for learning\r\nand to the comparatively small esteem in which the office was then held.\r\nThe humanists were delighted at the election of one of their own number.\r\nAs pope, he devoted his revenues to maintaining a splendid court, to the\r\nrebuilding of the fortifications and palaces of Rome, and to the\r\nenrichment of scholars. During his pontificate the city became a\r\nwork-shop of erudition. He founded the Vatican Library, for which he\r\ncollected five thousand volumes, and the list prepared by him for Cosimo\r\nde' Medici to use in beginning the Library of San Marco, was followed\r\nalso by Duke Federico of Urbino. He was a small, ugly man.\r\n\r\n_Nihil Papa Valet_, ‘the Pope is good for nothing.’\r\n\r\nNote 197 page 127. I.e., in the second tale of the Eighth Day.\r\n\r\nNote 198 page 127.

Niccolò Campani, called STRASCINO, (born 1478; died\r\nbetween 1522 and 1533), was an excellent actor of Sienese rustic\r\ncomedies and farces, and the author of verses and of a Lament that was\r\nvery popular in the 16th century. He frequented the court of Leo X, and\r\nseveral of Castiglione’s letters (1521) tell of efforts to secure the\r\nactor’s services for the Marquess of Mantua, and of furnishing him with\r\ntwenty-five ducats, a horse, and a papal pass, for the purpose.\r\n\r\nNote 200 page 128. ‘This place,’ i.e., Urbino.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  POPE NICHOLAS V\r\n  TOMMASO PARENTUCELLI\r\n  1398-1455\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a coloured cast of a medal, in the King’s Library at the\r\n    British Museum, by Andrea Guazzalotti (1435-1495).

The reader will hardly need to be reminded that the\r\ngreat Roman orator was often spoken of as Tullius or Tully rather than\r\nas Cicero.\r\n\r\nNote 202 page 129. When THE COURTIER was expurgated by Antonio\r\nCiccarelli in 1584 (see LIST OF EDITIONS), Dante’s name was here\r\nsubstituted for that of St. Paul. The word _becco_ (rendered ‘he-goat’)\r\nhas long been used by the Italians as a term of jocose reproach applied\r\nto a man whose wife is unfaithful.\r\n\r\nNote 203 page 129. Duke ERCOLE I D'ESTE, (born 1431; died 1505), was the\r\nlegitimate son of Duke Niccolò III and Rizzarda di Saluzzo. Bred at the\r\nNeapolitan court, he became Duke of Ferrara on the death of his\r\nhalf-brother Borso (see note 149) in 1471. In 1473 he married Eleanora\r\nof Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples. Among the six children of\r\nthis union were: Isabella, who became Marchioness of Mantua (see note\r\n397); Beatrice, who became Duchess of Milan (see note 398); Alfonso, who\r\nmarried Lucrezia Borgia and succeeded his father as duke; and the\r\nCardinal Ippolito already mentioned (see note 64). Although his reign\r\nwas far from peaceful, his court was noted for its luxury and for the\r\nbrilliancy of art and letters with which it was adorned. He was an\r\nespecial patron of the theatre, no less than five comedies of Plautus\r\nbeing performed during the wedding festivities of his son Alfonso in\r\n1502. On the other hand, he maintained relations with Savonarola, who\r\nwas a native of Ferrara.\r\n\r\nNote 204 page 130. Castellina was a small walled town in the Chianti\r\nhills, which was held as a Florentine outpost against Siena. The siege\r\nreferred to in the text took place in 1478, when the place capitulated\r\nto the Neapolitan and papal troops after holding out for forty days.\r\nDuke of Calabria was the title regularly borne by the heir of each\r\nAragonese king of Naples. The personage here meant must have been\r\nAlfonso the Younger (see note 31).\r\n\r\nNote 205 page 130. While the meaning is not free from doubt, the point\r\nof the story seems to lie in the absurdity of the Florentine’s supposing\r\nthat after being discharged from a cannon, a projectile would retain any\r\npoison previously applied to it.\r\n\r\nNote 206 page 130. It will be remembered that Bembo was a Venetian,\r\nwhile Bibbiena’s birthplace was a Florentine town.\r\n\r\nNote 207 page 130. This war lasted from 1494 to 1509, and proved ruinous\r\nto both sides. Castiglione’s use of the past tense in speaking of it\r\nhere doubtless arose from the fact that he was writing several years\r\nafter the date that he assigns to the dialogues.\r\n\r\nNote 208 page 131. Pistoia and Prato were two small cities which lay to\r\nthe north-west of Florence and were subject to its rule. Modern issues\r\nof “fiat” money are but a slight modification of the method proposed by\r\nthe worthy Florentine.\r\n\r\nNote 209 page 131. Bucentaur was the name of the state galley of the\r\nVenetian Republic, used (among other occasions) in the symbolic ceremony\r\nof wedding the Adriatic, which was enjoined upon the Venetians by\r\nAlexander III (pope 1159-1181) to commemorate their victory over the\r\nfleet of Frederick Barbarossa. On each Ascension Day a ring was dropped\r\nfrom the Bucentaur into the Adriatic, with the words, “we espouse thee,\r\nsea, in token of true and lasting dominion.” The vessel bore the image\r\nof a centaur as figure-head. Of the last of several successive\r\nBucentaurs (demolished in 1824), a few fragments are preserved in the\r\nArsenal at Venice. In the 15th and 16th centuries the name was applied\r\nto state vessels of ceremony elsewhere. By some the word is supposed to\r\nbe derived from the Greek βοῦς (ox) and κένταυρος (centaur); by others\r\nit is regarded as a corruption of the Latin _ducentorum_ (of two hundred\r\noars), or of the Italian _buzino d’oro_ (golden bark).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GIROLAMO DONATO\r\n  1457-1511\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a photograph, courteously furnished by the Director of the\r\n    Municipal Art Museum at Milan, of a small anonymous bas-relief\r\n    belonging to the Taverna collection.

This tale, not unworthy of Munchausen, may have been\r\nsuggested to Castiglione by a passage in one of the minor works of\r\nPlutarch, who relates that Antiphanes (a friend of Plato) said that “he\r\nvisited a certain city where words froze as soon as spoken, by reason of\r\nthe great cold; and later, sounds uttered in winter melted in the spring\r\nand were heard by the inhabitants.” Although Plutarch represents the\r\nstory as told in illustration of the way in which “those who came as\r\nyoung men to listen to Plato’s talk, understood it only long afterwards,\r\nwhen they had grown old,” it is worth noting that an Antiphanes, of\r\nBerga in Thrace, is known as a writer on the marvellous and incredible.\r\n\r\nNote 211 page 133. Vasco da Gama rounded the southern extremity of\r\nAfrica and reached India nine years before the date of the Courtier\r\ndialogues.\r\n\r\nNote 212 page 133. This must have been Emanuel I, who was King of\r\nPortugal from 1495 until his death in 1521, and who promoted the\r\nexpeditions of da Gama and other Portuguese navigators.\r\n\r\nNote 213 page 134. Taffety was a very light soft silk fabric. There is\r\nextant a letter of Bembo’s (1541), in which the aged cardinal orders two\r\ncushions filled with swan’s down and covered with crimson taffety. The\r\nword is said to be derived from the Persian _taftah_ (twisted, woven).\r\nTaft is the name of a town in central Persia.\r\n\r\nNote 214 page 134. ANNIBAL PALEOTTO, (died 1516), belonged to an ancient\r\nand honourable Bolognese family (with which Castiglione is known to have\r\nbeen on friendly terms), and was the son of an eminent jurist, Vincenzo\r\nPaleotto, who died in 1498. Leo X made Annibale a senator of Bologna in\r\n1514, the brief being written by Bembo.\r\n\r\nNote 215 page 135. Giacopo di Nino was BISHOP OF POTENZA from 1506 until\r\n1521, and seems to have been a butt for the ridicule of Leo X's court.\r\n\r\nNote 216 page 136. An earlier version of this passage reads: “And of\r\nthis kind was what Rinaldo in the _Morgante_ said to the Giant: ‘Where\r\ndo you hang your spectacles?’” The _Morgante Maggiore_ is a\r\nserio-burlesque romantic poem by Luigi Pulci (1431-1487), introducing,\r\namong other characters of mediæval romance, Rinaldo, his cousin Orlando,\r\nand the giant Morgante.\r\n\r\nNote 217 page 136. GALEOTTO MARZI DA NARNI, (born about 1427; died about\r\n1490), a singular example of the adventurer-humanist, studied at the\r\nuniversities of Padua and Bologna, and taught at the latter place. He\r\ntwice visited the court of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, for whom he\r\nwrote a book on jests. He was something of an astrologer and also the\r\nauthor of a work on chiromancy. Being accused of heresy, he was\r\nimprisoned at Venice in 1477, and condemned to make public recantation\r\nin the Piazzetta with a crown of devils on his head. He is said to have\r\nbeen learned and witty. The story given in the text became almost\r\nproverbial.\r\n\r\nNote 218 page 136. The present form (_bisticcio_) of _bischisso_\r\n(rendered ‘playing on words’) has a meaning somewhat different from that\r\nindicated in the text,—being the term applied to a succession of words\r\nthe similarity of whose sound renders them difficult to pronounce, e.g.,\r\n“Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.”\r\n\r\nNote 219 page 136. At this time the general use of family names was\r\ncomparatively recent, and their form was somewhat variable. Thus, such\r\nsurnames as Pio and Fregoso were treated as still being, what they\r\ndoubtless originally were, merely personal epithets, and so were given\r\nthe feminine form (Pia, Fregosa) when applied to women. The adjective\r\n_pia_ means dutiful, pious, kind, while _impia_ or _empia_ of course\r\nmeans the reverse.\r\n\r\nNote 220 page 136. “The greatest of the Furies is my bedfellow.” With a\r\nchange of one syllable in the Latin, this becomes _Furiarum maxima juxta\r\naccubat_ (“The greatest of the Furies lies hard by”), Æneid, V, 605-6.\r\n\r\nNote 221 page 136. GERONIMO DONATO, (born 1457; died 1511), was a native\r\nof Venice, where he held many public offices, besides being sent abroad\r\nas ambassador of the Republic, especially to the courts of Alexander VI\r\nand Julius II. He also enjoyed no small fame as a cultivator of science,\r\nart and letters (particularly Greek and theology). The incident narrated\r\nin the text occurred during his embassy to Alexander, to whom on another\r\noccasion he made a far wittier retort. Being jestingly asked by the pope\r\nwhere Venice got its right of lordship over the Adriatic, he answered:\r\n“Let your Holiness show me the title deed to the Patrimony of St. Peter,\r\nand on the back of it will be found inscribed the grant to the Venetians\r\nof their dominion over the Adriatic.”\r\n\r\nNote 222 page 136. In the Roman Church a “station” (_stasione_) is a\r\nchurch where indulgences are granted at certain seasons. In earlier\r\ntimes such churches were visited in solemn procession, which afterwards\r\ncame to be regarded as an opportunity for social recreation. The word is\r\nused also to designate the indulgences earned by visiting, on appointed\r\ndays, many churches founded by popes.\r\n\r\nNote 223 page 136. “As many stars as heaven, so many girls hath thy\r\nRome,” Ovid’s _Ars Amandi_, I, 59.\r\n\r\nNote 224 page 136. “As many kids as the pasture, so many satyrs hath thy\r\nRome,” is as close an English rendering as Donato’s Latin will bear.\r\n\r\nNote 225 page 136. MARCANTONIO DELLA TORRE belonged to an ancient noble\r\nfamily of Verona, was a famous anatomist, and is said to have included\r\nLeonardo da Vinci among his pupils. He died at the age of thirty, and\r\nwas highly praised for his learning. His father Geronimo lectured on\r\nmedicine at Padua.\r\n\r\nPietro Barozzi became ARCHBISHOP OF PADUA in 1487, and died in 1507.\r\nBandello (who had read THE COURTIER in MS.) relates the same story in\r\nsomewhat wittier form, but gives the name of the prelate as Gerardo\r\nLandriano, Bishop of Como.\r\n\r\nNote 226 page 137.

PROTO DA LUCCA was one of the most famous buffoons\r\nwho enlivened the pontifical court at the beginning of the 16th century.\r\nIf, as seems probable, the incident in question occurred in January 1506\r\n(when Bernardino Lei died and was succeeded by Antonio da Castriani as\r\nBishop of Cagli, a town near Urbino), the pope in question must have\r\nbeen Julius II, to whom the epithet ‘very grave’ would be entirely\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\nNote 229 page 138. The play is upon the word ‘office’ in its two\r\nmeanings of post or employment, and breviary or prayer-book. In the\r\nlatter sense, the ‘full office’ contained the psalms, lessons,\r\netc.,—while the ‘Madonna’s office’ was much abbreviated.\r\n\r\nNote 230 page 138. GIOVANNI CALFURNIO, (born 1443; died 1503), was a\r\ngentle and laborious humanist, born at or near Bergamo, but long\r\nresident at Padua, where he held the chair of rhetoric. His chief work\r\nconsisted in correcting and commenting upon the texts of Latin poets.\r\nThe ‘another man at Padua’ was probably Raffaele Regio (a fellow\r\nprofessor with Calfurnio), who publicly ridiculed his colleague as the\r\nson of a charcoal-burner. Calfurnio seems to have published very little;\r\non his death he bequeathed his library to the church of San Giovanni in\r\nVerdara, from which his tomb and portrait relief have recently been\r\nremoved to a cloister of the monastery of St. Antony at Padua.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GIOVANNI CALFURNIO\r\n  Died 1503\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph, specially made by Agostini, of the anonymous tomb\r\n    relief removed from the Church of San Giovanni di Verdara to a\r\n    cloister in the Monastery of Sant'Antonio at Padua.\r\n\r\nNote 231 page 138. Tommaso Inghirami, “FEDRA,” (born 1470; died 1516),\r\nwas a native patrician of Volterra (a town about midway between Pisa and\r\nSiena), being the son of Paolo Inghirami and Lucrezia Barlettani. Having\r\npassed his early boyhood at Florence, he removed to Rome in 1483, where\r\nhe played the part of _Phædra_ in Seneca’s tragedy _Hippolytus_ (upon\r\nwhich Racine founded his _Phèdre_) with such success that the name clung\r\nto him for life. The play being interrupted by an accident to the\r\nscenery, he filled the interval by improvising Latin verses for the\r\nentertainment of the audience. The performance took place in the\r\nmausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian, which was afterwards converted into\r\nthe fortress known as the Castle of St. Angelo. Tommaso was employed by\r\nAlexander VI in diplomatic affairs, crowned poet by the Emperor\r\nMaximilian I, and made a canon of the Lateran and of the Vatican. He\r\nseems to have been connected with the Vatican Library as early as 1505,\r\nand became its prefect. Although Erasmus called him the Cicero of his\r\ntime, his fame now rests rather on his portrait in the Pitti Gallery at\r\nFlorence, than on his works.\r\n\r\nNote 232 page 138. CAMILLO PALEOTTO was a brother of the Annibal\r\nPaleotto already mentioned (see note 214). On his father’s death in\r\n1498, he went to Rome, where he became the friend of Federico Fregoso,\r\nBembo and Castiglione. He taught rhetoric at Bologna and was Chancellor\r\nof the Senate there. There also he is said to have died in 1530,\r\nalthough a letter of Bembo’s speaks of him in 1518 as then already dead.\r\n\r\nNote 233 page 138. ANTONIO PORCARO, or PORZIO, belonged to a noble Roman\r\nfamily, and was a brother of the Camillo Porcaro mentioned in THE\r\nCOURTIER (at page 140). He had also a twin brother Valerio, whom he so\r\nclosely resembled that the two were often mistaken, one for the other,\r\nas Bibbiena says in the preface to his _Calandra_,—the plot of which is\r\nfounded upon a similar resemblance. Little more is known of Antonio than\r\nthat he suffered some grievous wrong from Alexander VI.\r\n\r\nNote 234 page 138. Regarding GIANTOMMASO GALEOTTO, Cian furnishes no\r\ninformation. The Spanish annotator, Fabié, adds Marcio (Marzio) to his\r\nname,—thus apparently treating him as identical with the Galeotto da\r\nNarni mentioned above at page 136,—and says that he “died, by reason of\r\nhis great corpulence, from a fall from his horse, being in the train of\r\nCharles VIII of France, when the latter entered Milan.” As “My lord\r\nPrefect” was only four years old when Charles entered Milan in 1494,\r\nthis identification seems clearly erroneous.\r\n\r\nNote 235 page 139. FILIPPO BEROALDO, (born 1472; died 1518), belonged to\r\na noble Bolognese family. Having been one of his famous uncle Filippo\r\nthe elder’s most brilliant pupils in the classics, he was at the age of\r\ntwenty-six made professor of literature at Bologna, and afterwards at\r\nRome. In 1511 he successfully defended Duke Francesco Maria of Urbino\r\nagainst the charge of murdering Cardinal Alidosi. Instead of seeking to\r\nextenuate the deed, as done in heat and under strong provocation, he\r\nboldly justified it on the ground that his client was the instrument\r\nchosen by the Almighty to rid the world of a monster of wickedness, and\r\neloquently appealed to the tribunal to spare a hero whose promise of\r\nfuture usefulness was precious to Italy. Beroaldo was secretary to\r\nCardinal Giovanni de' Medici, and on the latter’s election as pope, he\r\nwas made Provost of the Roman Academy, while at Inghirami’s death he was\r\nmade Librarian of the Vatican, as a reward for editing the recently\r\ndiscovered first five books of Tacitus’s Annals. He died at Rome, partly\r\n(it is said) from vexation at not being paid the stipend of his office.\r\nBembo wrote his epitaph. Although he was celebrated for erudition and\r\neloquence rather than for authorship, he left three books of odes, and\r\none of epigrams,—in Latin.\r\n\r\nNote 236 page 139. The pupil obviously used the phrase in its low Latin\r\nmeaning, “Master, God give you good evening.” Beroaldo jocosely accepted\r\nit in its classical meaning, “Master, God give you good, late.”\r\n\r\nNote 237 page 139. “Evil to thee, soon.”\r\n\r\nNote 238 page 139. DIEGO DE CHIGNONES, (died 1512), was a Spanish\r\ncavalier, of whom Branthôme writes as follows: “This Great Captain had\r\nfor lieutenant, with a company of one hundred men-at-arms, Don Diego de\r\nQuignones, who supported him in his combats and victories, and was truly\r\na good and brave lieutenant to him. After the Great Captain’s death, he\r\nhad sole command of his company of an hundred men-at-arms, as he well\r\ndeserved to have. He commanded it at the battle of Ravenna, where he\r\ndied like a brave and valiant captain. And if all had behaved as he did\r\n(say the old Spaniards), the victory that the French won there would\r\nhave cost them dearer than it did, although it cost them dear.”\r\n\r\nNote 239 page 139. Don Gonzalvo Hernand y Aguilar, better known as\r\nConsalvo de Cordoba, or THE GREAT CAPTAIN, (born 1443; died 1515), was a\r\nnative of Montilla, near Cordova, and belonged to an ancient family of\r\nSpanish grandees. His father’s name was Pietro, and his mother’s was\r\nElvira Errea. Bred to war in early youth and knighted on the field of\r\nbattle at the age of sixteen, he followed the fortunes of Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, and took an active part in the conquest of Granada. In 1494 he\r\nwas sent to Italy to aid Ferdinand II of Naples against Charles VIII,\r\nwon a long succession of victories over the French, and was finally made\r\nConstable and Viceroy of Naples. Later, Ferdinand the Catholic,\r\nlistening to slanderous reports regarding him, deprived him of office,\r\nand in 1507 recalled him to Spain, where he died in disgrace. His good\r\nqualities were much admired by Castiglione, who had fought against him,\r\nbut his fame was not unstained by acts of cruelty and bad faith, which\r\n(it is fair to say) were common at the time and seem to have been\r\ncommitted only against his master’s foes. Giorgione is said to have\r\npainted his portrait at Venice, and a life of him by Paolo Giovio was\r\npublished at Florence in 1552.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CONSALVO DE CORDOBA\r\n  “THE GREAT CAPTAIN”\r\n  1443-1515\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a negative, specially made by Alinari through the courtesy\r\n    of Professor I. B. Supino, of Annibal’s medal in the National Museum\r\n    at Florence. See Armand’s _Les Médailleurs Italiens_, i, 176.\r\n\r\nNote 240 page 139. The Spanish word _vino_ means not only “wine” but\r\nalso “he came.” In pronunciation it would be easily mistaken for _Y-no_.\r\n_Y no lo conocistes_ is the Spanish for “And thou knewest Him not.”\r\nCompare St. John, i, 11.\r\n\r\nNote 241 page 139. The word _marano_ (here rendered “heretic”) meant a\r\nrenegade Moor, and is said by Symonds to have been generally used in\r\nItaly at this time as a term of reproach against Spaniards.\r\n\r\nNote 242 page 139. GIACOMO SADOLETO, (born 1477; died 1547), was a\r\nnative of Modena and the son of a noted jurist, Giovanni Sadoleto. He\r\nstudied Latin at Ferrara and Greek at Rome, where he settled in the\r\npontificate of Alexander VI and acquired a great reputation for\r\nlearning. Leo X appointed him a secretary at the same time with Bembo,\r\n(who shared with him the name of being the best Latinist of the day),\r\nand soon made him Bishop of Carpentras, a town fifteen miles north-east\r\nof Avignon. He was secretary also to Clement VII, to whom he boldly\r\ndeclared that the sack of Rome (1527) was inflicted by God as a\r\npunishment for human wickedness. Paul III created him a cardinal in\r\n1536. A sincerely pious man, he was conscious of the evils of the Church\r\nand did not escape suspicion of heresy. He was a close friend of\r\nVittoria Colonna, and the Roman Academy often met at his house on the\r\nQuirinal. Besides Latin poems (one of which, on the newly discovered\r\nLaocoön group, made him famous), his works include commentaries on the\r\nPsalms and the Epistle to the Romans, and a Latin exhortation to the\r\nprinces and people of Germany against Lutheran heresies. Although far\r\nfrom rich, he was very charitable, especially in providing young men of\r\nhis flock with the means of education.\r\n\r\nNote 243 page 139. LUDOVICO DA SAN BONIFACIO is identified by Cian as a\r\nPaduan, who held the offices of prothonotary and private chamberlain\r\nunder Leo X, successfully disputed with Bembo the possession of a\r\ncanonry at Padua in 1514, was sent to different courts by Leo, and died\r\nat Padua in 1545.\r\n\r\nERCOLE RANGONE, (died 1572), belonged to an illustrious family of\r\nModena, and achieved some note as a soldier and diplomatist, having\r\ncommanded the Florentine forces in 1529, and served as Ferrarese\r\nambassador to France, Spain and Germany. He was esteemed by Castiglione,\r\nof whose wife Ippolita Torello he seems to have been a kinsman.\r\n\r\nThe COUNT OF PEPOLI probably belonged to a noble Bolognese family of\r\nthat name, but has not been identified with certainty.\r\n\r\nNote 244 page 140. Of SALLAZA DALLA PEDRADA nothing seems to be known\r\nbeyond the mention of him in the text.\r\n\r\nNote 245 page 140. PALLA DEGLI STROZZI, (born 1372; died 1462), was a\r\nwealthy and cultivated Florentine patrician. Having honourably filled\r\nhigh offices of state, he was banished by Cosimo de' Medici in 1434 for\r\nten years to Padua. Himself an enthusiastic scholar and patron of\r\nclassical studies, he caused many Greek MSS. to be brought into Italy\r\n(including works of Plato, Aristotle and Plutarch), and was the first\r\nItalian to collect books for the express purpose of founding a public\r\nlibrary, in the execution of which design he was prevented by his exile\r\nfrom anticipating Cosimo. He employed learned Greeks to read to him, and\r\nwas instrumental in inducing Chrysoloras to teach at Florence,—an\r\nengagement regarded by Symonds as having secured the future of Hellenic\r\nstudy in Europe. The story narrated of him in the text is elsewhere told\r\nof an exile belonging to the Albizzi family.\r\n\r\nNote 246 page 140. COSIMO DE' MEDICI, _Pater Patriæ_, (born 1389; died\r\n1464), was a Florentine banker, statesman and patron of literature and\r\nart. In his father Giovanni’s house of business he cultivated the rare\r\nfaculty for finance that he afterwards employed in public administration\r\nand private commerce. He inherited his father’s vast fortune in 1429,\r\nand made it a practice to lend money to needy citizens and at the same\r\ntime to involve the affairs of Florence with his own,—thus not only\r\nattaching individuals to his interests, but rendering it difficult to\r\ncontrol state expenditures apart from his own bank. He understood also\r\nhow to use his money without exciting jealousy, and while he spent large\r\nsums on public works, he declined the architect Brunelleschi’s plans for\r\na residence more befitting a prince than a citizen. He was an early\r\nriser, and temperate and simple in his life. While ruling Florence with\r\ndespotic power, he seemed intent on the routine of his counting-house,\r\nand put forward other men to execute his political schemes. Despite\r\noccasional checks, he so firmly established the influence of his family\r\nas the real rulers of Florence that they were not permanently expelled\r\nuntil the nineteenth century. Much of his power was due to sympathy with\r\nthe intellectual movement of the age, and although he was not a Greek\r\nscholar, he had a solid education, and collected MSS., gems, coins and\r\ninscriptions, employing his commercial agents in the work. During a year\r\nof exile, he built a library at Venice, and later he built one at\r\nFlorence and another at Fiesole. His house was the centre of a literary\r\nand philosophical society, which included all the wits of Florence and\r\nthe strangers who flocked to that capital of culture.\r\n\r\nNote 247 page 140. CAMILLO PORCARO, or PORZIO, (died 1517), was a\r\nbrother of the Antonio Porcaro already mentioned in THE COURTIER (at\r\npage 138; see note 233). He was a professor of rhetoric at Rome, and a\r\ncanon of St. Peter’s. Leo X made him Bishop of Teramo, a town near the\r\nAdriatic north-east of Rome. He was a member of the Roman Academy, and\r\nsome of his Latin verse has survived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COSIMO DE' MEDICI\r\n  _PATER PATRIÆ_\r\n  1389-1464\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a coloured cast of a medal (no. 31), in the King’s Library\r\n    at the British Museum, attributed to Niccolò Fiorentino.\r\n\r\nNote 248 page 140. MARCANTONIO COLONNA, (died 1522), the son of\r\nPierantonio Colonna and Bernardina Conti, was a second cousin of\r\nVittoria Colonna. His wife Lucrezia Gara della Rovere was a niece of\r\nJulius II and sister of the Cardinal Galeotto della Rovere already\r\nmentioned (at page 122; see note 189). In 1502 he fled from Rome to\r\nescape the persecution of the Borgias, repaired to the kingdom of\r\nNaples, and took service under the “Great Captain.” He served also in\r\nthe armies of Julius II, Maximilian I, and Francis I, and took part in\r\nnearly all the wars of his time. He was cited as a model of physical\r\nbeauty and martial prowess.\r\n\r\nNote 249 page 141. DIEGO GARZIA is regarded by the Spanish annotator,\r\nFabié, as identical with the famous warrior Diego Garcia de Paredes,\r\n(born 1466; died 1530), who began the life of a soldier at the age of\r\ntwelve, and had a brilliant share, with the “Great Captain,” in the\r\nexpulsion of the Moors from Spain and later in the Italian campaigns. He\r\nwas a man of great height and strength, and is said on one occasion to\r\nhave stopped the wheel of a rapidly moving wind-mill with his single\r\nhand. Charles V made him a Knight of the Golden Spur, and he is often\r\ncalled the Chevalier Bayard of Spain.\r\n\r\nNote 250 page 141. LOUIS XII, (born 1462; died 1515), was the son of\r\nDuke Charles d'Orléans and Anne of Cleves. He accompanied Charles VIII\r\ninto Italy in 1494, became king on his cousin’s death in 1498, and the\r\nfollowing year married Charles’s widow Anne of Brittany. In 1500 he\r\nexpelled Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan, to whose duchy he laid claim as\r\nthe grandson of Valentina Visconti. The following year he conquered\r\nNaples in alliance with Ferdinand the Catholic, but quarrelled with his\r\nally over the division of the country, with the result that his force\r\nwas defeated by the “Great Captain” at Garigliano in 1503, and withdrew\r\nfrom Naples in 1504. He joined the League of Cambray against Venice in\r\n1508, but in 1511 the Holy League was formed against him, and in 1513\r\nthe French were again compelled to leave Italy. On the death of Anne of\r\nBrittany in 1514, he married Mary, the youthful sister of Henry VIII of\r\nEngland, to whom in dying (1 January 1515) he is reported to have said:\r\n“Dear, I leave thee my death as a New Year’s gift.” He was sincerely\r\nregretted by his subjects, and was known as “The Father of His People.”\r\nMichelet says of him: “He was a good man, honest by nature, sometimes\r\nabsurd, indiscreet, talkative, testy; but he had a heart, and the only\r\nway for men to flatter him was to persuade him that they desired the\r\ngood of his subjects.” Among his sayings was “Good king, stingy king; I\r\nprefer to be ridiculous to my courtiers, than deaf to my people.”\r\n\r\nNote 251 page 141. DJEM or ZIZIM, (born 1459; died 1495), was a son of\r\nMahomet II, the conqueror of Constantinople. On the death of his father\r\nin 1481, he tried to dispossess his brother as sultan, but being\r\ndefeated, he sought refuge at Rhodes, where the Knights of the Order of\r\nSt. John received him for a while, and then sent him to France. In 1489\r\nhe was surrendered to the custody of Innocent VIII, from whom he passed\r\ninto the hands of Alexander VI. Both these pontiffs received a subsidy\r\nfor his maintenance from his brother the sultan. In 1495 Charles VIII\r\ntook him to Naples, where he was imprisoned and soon died from the\r\neffect (it is supposed) of poison administered at Rome by order of\r\nAlexander VI. Of his life at the papal court, we get the following\r\nglimpse in a letter from Mantegna to the Marquess of Mantua: “The Turk’s\r\nbrother is here, strictly guarded in the palace of his Holiness, who\r\nallows him all sorts of diversion, such as hunting, music, and the like.\r\nHe often comes to eat in this new palace where I paint [i.e., the\r\nBelvedere], and, for a barbarian, his manners are not amiss. There is a\r\nsort of majestic bearing about him, and he never doffs his cap to the\r\nPope, having in fact none;... He eats five times a day, and sleeps as\r\noften; before meals he drinks sugared water like a monkey. He has the\r\ngait of an elephant, but his people praise him much, especially for his\r\nhorsemanship: it may be so, but I have never seen him take his feet out\r\nof the stirrups, or give any other proof of skill. He is a most savage\r\nman, and has stabbed at least four persons, who are said not to have\r\nsurvived four hours. A few days ago, he gave such a cuffing to one of\r\nhis interpreters that they had to carry him to the river, in order to\r\nbring him round. It is believed that Bacchus pays him many a visit. On\r\nthe whole he is dreaded by those about him. He takes little heed of\r\nanything, like one who does not understand or has no reason. His way of\r\nlife is quite peculiar; he sleeps without undressing, and gives audience\r\nsitting cross-legged, in the Parthian fashion. He carries on his head\r\nsixty thousand yards of linen, and wears so long a pair of trousers that\r\nhe is lost in them, and astonishes all beholders.”\r\n\r\nNote 252 page 141. The GRAND TURK in question was Bajazet II, (born\r\n1447; died 1512), who succeeded his father (Mahomet II, the conqueror of\r\nConstantinople) in 1481, was almost uninterruptedly engaged in war with\r\nHungary, Venice, Egypt and Persia, was deposed by his son Selim, and\r\ndied soon afterwards. He was repeatedly invited by Alexander VI to\r\ninvade Europe and fight the pope’s Christian enemies. The friendly\r\nrelations between the two were closely connected with the captivity of\r\nBajazet’s brother, just mentioned. As a token of his gratitude, the Turk\r\nsent Innocent VIII the “Lance of Longinus,” the centurion who was\r\nsupposed to have pierced the Saviour’s side on Calvary and afterwards to\r\nhave been converted to Christianity. As a reward for the death of his\r\nbrother, he sent Alexander VI a sum of money equivalent to over £500,000\r\nsterling, and a tunic alleged to have been worn by the Saviour. These,\r\nhowever, were intercepted by the pope’s enemy, Giuliano della Rovere,\r\nafterwards Julius II.\r\n\r\nNote 253 page 142. The Archbishopric of Florence was occupied by Roberto\r\nFolco from 1481 until his death in 1530.\r\n\r\n‘The Alexandrian cardinal’ is the name by which Giannantonio di\r\nSangiorgio, (born 1439; died 1509), was commonly known. At the age of\r\ntwenty-seven he became professor of canon law at Pavia. In 1479 he was\r\nmade Bishop of Alexandria, and soon afterwards called to Rome and made\r\nan Auditor of the _Ruota_ (see note 292), which office he continued to\r\nhold until he was created a cardinal in 1493. He was regarded as the\r\nmost eminent jurist of his day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BAJAZET II OF TURKEY\r\n  1447-1512\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged, with the courteous permission of the Director of the New York\r\n    Public Library, from a photographic copy of an engraving in Paolo\r\n    Giovio’s “Eulogy.”\r\n\r\nNote 254 page 142. Besides the mention of this NICOLETTO in the text,\r\nnothing more seems to be known of him beyond the following anecdote: “Of\r\nmesser Nicoletto da Orvieto it is narrated that, being in the service of\r\nthat very courteous pontiff Pope Leo, he once won the lasting favour of\r\nhis Holiness with only four words; for one day, the talk turning upon a\r\ncertain vacant benefice which was sought after by a member of the\r\nVitelli family to whom it could be given, he said humourously: ‘Holy\r\nFather, fitness requires that it be by all means conferred on Vitello\r\n(calf), the more because it has no nearer or closer kinsman than he\r\nis,’—playing on the word ‘vacant,’ which he seemed to derive from\r\n_vacca_ (cow), the mother of the calf.” Garzoni’s _L’Hospidale de’ Pazzi\r\nIncurabili_, (Piacenza: 1586), page 142.\r\n\r\nNote 255 page 142. Antonio Cammelli, (born 1440; died 1502), called\r\nPISTOIA from the name of his birthplace, was a prolific writer of verse,\r\nchiefly sonnets of a humourous and satirical character, which have no\r\nsmall historical value. He spent the larger part of his life in the\r\nservice of the d’Este at Ferrara, and in that of Duke Ludovico Sforza,\r\nof Milan, to whom he remained faithful in adversity. An edition of his\r\nverse was published at Turin by Renier in 1888.\r\n\r\nThe SERAFINO here mentioned is identified by Cian as a now almost\r\nforgotten lyric poet, Serafino Ciminelli, (born 1466; died 1500), who\r\nwas a native of Aquila (fifty-five miles north-east of Rome), and a\r\nwelcome guest at the courts of Naples, Rome, Urbino, Mantua and Milan.\r\nHis verse was by some preferred to that of Petrarch, and the unbounded\r\npopularity which he enjoyed was doubtless due to the skill with which he\r\nimprovised to his own accompaniment on the lute. He was a short ugly man\r\nof elfish appearance.\r\n\r\nNote 256 page 142. GIOVANNI GONZAGA, (born 1474; died 1523), was the\r\nthird son of the Marquess Federico of Mantua and Margarita of Bavaria.\r\nHe married Laura Bentivoglio, fought in his youth against Charles VIII,\r\nand in 1512 was in the service of the Sforza family. He was employed\r\nalso by his brother Gianfrancesco, Marquess of Mantua, in political\r\nnegotiations. In 1519, on the death of Lucrezia Borgia, he wrote to his\r\nnephew, the new Marquess Federico of Mantua: “Lucrezia’s death\r\noccasioned much grief throughout the city, and his Ducal Highness in\r\nparticular displayed extreme distress. Men here tell wonderful things of\r\nher life: for the last ten years she wore a hair shirt; and for two\r\nyears she has been in the habit of confessing every day, and of\r\nattending Communion three or four times a month.”\r\n\r\nNote 257 page 142. Giovanni’s son ALESSANDRO GONZAGA was born in 1497,\r\nand died in 1527.\r\n\r\nNote 258 page 142. GIACOMO D’ATRI (or d’Adria Picena) was made Count of\r\nPIANELLA by Ferdinand II of Naples in 1496, as a reward for faithful\r\nservice. He acted as confidential secretary to the Marquess\r\nGianfrancesco of Mantua in various wars, and especially in the campaigns\r\nagainst Charles VIII.\r\n\r\nNote 259 page 143. PHILIP II of Macedon, the conqueror of Greece, was\r\nborn 382 and died 336 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 260 page 143. This retort has by others been ascribed to a\r\nFlorentine ambassador at Siena, and his name given as Guido del Pelagio.\r\n\r\nNote 261 page 144. MARIO DE’ MAFFEI DA VOLTERRA, (born 1464; died 1537),\r\noccupied successively the offices of Archpriest at Volterra, Sacristan\r\nof the Vatican, Bishop of Aquino, and Bishop of Cavaillon in France.\r\n\r\nNote 262 page 144. AGOSTINO BEVAZZANO or Beazzano, (_flor._ 1500-1550),\r\nwas born at Treviso, near Venice, of which republic his ancestor\r\nFrancesco had been chancellor in the 15th century. His own portrait hung\r\nin the Grand Council Chamber at Venice. He lived some time in Venice,\r\nbut in 1514 he was employed as secretary by Bembo and sent to Leo X at\r\nRome, where he resided chiefly until 1526. Besides being a noted writer\r\nof Italian and Latin verse, he acquired great skill in public affairs\r\nand came to be regarded as an oracle at the papal court. Late in life he\r\nwas painfully afflicted with gout, and passed the last years of his life\r\nat Verona and at Treviso, where he died and was buried in the cathedral.\r\n\r\nNote 263 page 145. The MARQUESS FEDERICO GONZAGA of Mantua, (born 1440;\r\ndied 1484), was the son of the Marquess Ludovico and Barbara of\r\nBrandenburg, and married Margarita, daughter of Duke Albert III of\r\nBavaria. His family attained sovereign power at Mantua in 1354 and\r\ncontinued to exercise it for nearly four centuries. Having succeeded to\r\nthe marquisate on the death of his father in 1478, he expelled from\r\nItaly the Swiss who were besieging Lugano, joined the Milanese in a\r\nleague against the pope in 1479, and in 1482 joined another league\r\nagainst Venice. He is said to have committed suicide.\r\n\r\nNote 264 page 145. NICCOLÒ LEONICO TOMEO, (born 1456; died 1531), was a\r\nnative of Venice, and belonged to an Albanian family. He studied Greek\r\nunder Chalcondylas at Florence, and for many years taught philosophy at\r\nPadua, being the first Italian to expound Aristotle from the original\r\ntext. He wrote philosophical and moral dialogues and also some Italian\r\nverse. His friend Bembo wrote of him: “An illustrious philosopher both\r\nin life and learning, equally versed in Latin and Greek, wherein he\r\nlived and dwelt, leaving ambition and thirst for riches to others.” He\r\nwas also a wit.\r\n\r\nNote 265 page 145. AGOSTINO FOGLIETTA, (died 1527), was a Genoese\r\nnobleman, who exercised great authority at Rome under Leo X and Clement\r\nVII. He was a warm friend of Castiglione, who received cordial aid from\r\nhim in the efforts that were made on behalf of Francesco Maria della\r\nRovere. He was slain in the sack of Rome by a shot from an arquebuse.

GIOVANNI DI CARDONA was a Spanish soldier in the\r\nservice of the “Great Captain” and of Cesare Borgia. He had a brother\r\nUgo (mentioned at page 147, see note 271) and another brother Pedro, who\r\nwas Count of Gosilano. Giovanni seems to have fallen at the battle of\r\nRavenna in 1512.\r\n\r\nNote 267 page 146. Of ALFONSO SANTACROCE nothing more is known than is\r\ncontained in this mention of him in the text.\r\n\r\nNote 268 page 146. Francesco Alidosi, CARDINAL OF PAVIA, (died 1511),\r\nwas descended from the Lords of Imola, being the second son of the Lord\r\nof Castel del Rio. Having been educated for the Church, he attached\r\nhimself to Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, whose lasting gratitude he\r\nwon by steadfastly refusing to poison the cardinal at the desire of\r\nAlexander VI. On the accession of Julius II, he was rapidly promoted in\r\nspite of the objections raised in the consistory on the score of his\r\nquestionable character. He was made Bishop of Miletus, Bishop of Pavia,\r\na cardinal (1505), Legate of the Patrimony, Legate of Romagna, and\r\nArchbishop of Bologna. In these offices he proved violently tyrannical\r\nand a ruthless and bloody persecutor, especially of the Bolognese\r\npartisans of the Bentivogli; so that the city rose against him in 1511\r\nand drove him out. His assassination by young Francesco Maria della\r\nRovere has been already mentioned (see note 3). The odium connected with\r\nhis name finds an echo also in another passage in the text, page 151.\r\n\r\nNote 269 page 146. ALFONSO I of Naples, (born 1385; died 1458),\r\nsucceeded his father Ferdinand the Just as King of Aragon and Sicily in\r\n1416, and in 1435 managed to enforce against René of Provence his double\r\nclaim to Naples, based upon his descent from the former Hohenstauffen\r\nrulers of that kingdom, and also upon his adoption as heir by the last\r\nAngevin queen of Naples. Scholarly, enlightened, generous and\r\nbenevolent, he was the ideal type of royal Mæcenas and the hero of his\r\ncentury. He often went afoot and alone about his capital, saying that “a\r\nfather, walking amid his children, has naught to fear.” On one occasion\r\nwhen a galley full of soldiers and sailors was about to sink, and the\r\nmen he had ordered to their rescue were hesitating, he leaped into a\r\nskiff, crying, “I prefer to be the companion rather than a spectator of\r\ntheir death.” When Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turks in\r\n1453, he welcomed learned refugees to his capital; his court was a\r\nmeeting-place for the savants of his time; and even when engaged in war,\r\nhis captains might be seen gathered near their king, listening to his\r\nexposition of Livy instead of wasting their leisure at games of chance.\r\nHe was noted also for his gentle disposition and merry humour and seems\r\nto have deserved his title of “the Magnanimous.”\r\n\r\nNote 270 page 147. The battle of Cerignola (a town in Apulia near Cannæ,\r\nthe scene of one of Hannibal’s victories) was fought 28 April 1503,\r\nbetween the Spanish army under the “Great Captain” and the French forces\r\nof Louis XII, and resulted in the defeat of the latter with the loss of\r\nmore than half their men.\r\n\r\nNote 271 page 147. UGO DI CARDONA, a brother of the Giovanni already\r\nmentioned, was a Spanish soldier who fought under Cesare Borgia and the\r\n“Great Captain,” and was killed by the hand of Francis I at the battle\r\nof Pavia in 1525.\r\n\r\nNote 272 page 147. This is a corruption of the name of St. Erasmus, a\r\nSyrian bishop who suffered martyrdom about 304, and became a favourite\r\nsaint among the sailors on the Mediterranean. His name is given to\r\ncertain electrical phenomena often seen at sea and on land also.\r\n\r\nNote 273 page 147. OTTAVIANO UBALDINI, (died 1498), was the son of a\r\nfamous condottiere, Bernardino Ubaldini, and Aura di Montefeltro, a\r\nsister of Duke Federico. His father having died in 1437, he was bred at\r\nthe court of Urbino and became the trusted counsellor of his uncle\r\nFederico, who left to him the guardianship of the young duke,\r\nGuidobaldo. To personal valour and address in statecraft he united (if\r\nwe may trust the rhymed chronicle of Raphael’s father) a knowledge of\r\nclassic literature, and a taste for music and the other fine arts. He is\r\nknown to have been a zealous cultivator of astrology. By some writers\r\nDuke Federico (the circumstances of whose birth were not free from\r\nmystery) was believed to have been an Ubaldini, and this Ottaviano was\r\nopenly regarded as his brother.\r\n\r\nNote 274 page 147. ANTONELLO DA FORLI was a soldier of fortune who died\r\nbefore May 1488, and of whom little seems to be known apart from this\r\nanecdote. It is found also in two other books, where the witty\r\nFlorentine is named as Cosimo de’ Medici.\r\n\r\nNote 275 page 147. San Leo was a fortress perched on an almost\r\ninaccessible crag eighteen miles north-west of Urbino. It is mentioned\r\nby Dante (_Purgatorio_, iv, 25) and also by Machiavelli (Art of War, iv)\r\nas a place of great natural strength. When in the spring of 1502 Cesare\r\nBorgia disclosed his hostile designs against Duke Guidobaldo, the\r\nlatter, knowing that he could not hold out at Urbino, retired to San\r\nLeo, but soon afterwards fled in the garb of a peasant, and the castle\r\nwas surrendered. In the same year, however, it was recaptured by\r\nstratagem. In the spring of 1503 it was besieged by the adherents of\r\nBorgia, and bravely defended for six months by Ottaviano Fregoso and the\r\ncastellan Lattanzio da Bergamo (referred to in the text), in the hope of\r\nsuccour from Guidobaldo, who had taken refuge at Venice. Cian says that\r\nthe place at last fell and was not again recovered by Guidobaldo until\r\nafter the death of Alexander VI. On the other hand Dennistoun (ii, 13)\r\nasserts that by a reinforcement of twenty-five men the castle was\r\nenabled to hold out until Guidobaldo’s restoration; he assigns the\r\nincident in the text to the first capture (1502), gives the name of the\r\ncastellan as Scarmiglione da Foglino, and affirms that the surrender was\r\ntreacherous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CESARE BORGIA\r\n  1478-1507\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Alinari’s photograph (no. 13438) of the portrait, in the\r\n    Correr Museum at Venice, formerly ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci, but\r\n    recently attributed by Berenson to Francesco Beccaruzzi.\r\n\r\nNote 276 page 147. DUKE VALENTINO, i.e. Cesare Borgia, Duke of\r\nValentinois, (born 1478; died 1507), was an openly acknowledged son of\r\nCardinal Roderigo Borgia (afterwards Alexander VI) by Rosa Vanozza, who\r\nwas the mother also of Cesare’s sister Lucrezia. Created a cardinal on\r\nhis father’s accession, he procured the murder of his brother Giovanni\r\nin 1497, resigned his cardinalate the same year, was given the French\r\nduchy of Valentinois in 1498, and married Charlotte d’Albret, daughter\r\nof the King of Navarre, in 1499. Having been created Duke of Romagna by\r\nhis father in 1501, he proceeded to reduce the various fiefs comprised\r\nwithin his intended domain, including the duchy of Urbino. After the\r\ndeath of Alexander VI, Cesare was held in captivity by Julius II and by\r\nFerdinand the Catholic, escaped to his father-in-law’s court in 1506,\r\nand fell in battle the following year, the very day after the close of\r\nthe Courtier dialogues. Handsome, accomplished and subtle, he was a\r\npatron of learning and an adept in the cruel and perfidious politics of\r\nhis day. Upon his public career is founded the famous _Principe_ of\r\nMachiavelli, who says: “If all the duke’s achievements are considered,\r\nit will be found that he built up a great superstructure for his future\r\npower; nor do I know what precepts I could furnish to a prince better\r\nthan such as are to be derived from his example.”\r\n\r\nNote 277 page 148. Literally: “It must be believed to have been in\r\ndespair.”\r\n\r\nNote 278 page 148. PUBLIUS CORNELIUS SCIPIO NASICA (Scipio with the\r\npointed nose), was an eminent Roman jurist who was Consul in 191 B.C.,\r\nand own cousin of Scipio Africanus the Elder.\r\n\r\nNote 279 page 148. ALONSO CARILLO is said by Cian to have been one of\r\nthe many Spaniards who lived at Rome in the service of popes and\r\ncardinals belonging to that nation. The Spanish annotator Fabié\r\nidentifies him as a son of Don Luis and Donna Costanza de Rivera.\r\n\r\nNote 280 page 148. MY LADY BOADILLA. Cian’s identification of this lady\r\nas Beatriz Fernandez de Bobadilla, Marchioness of Moya, is confirmed by\r\nthe fact that Boscan’s translation (1534) gives her name as the\r\nMarchioness of Moya instead of ‘my lady Boadilla.’ She and her husband\r\nare warmly mentioned in a codicil to Isabella the Catholic’s will, as\r\nbeing among that queen’s most dear and faithful friends.\r\n\r\nNote 281 page 149. In this passage, Antonio Ciccarelli’s expurgated\r\nedition (1584) substitutes “a painter of antiquity” for Raphael,\r\n“certain Roman senators” for the two cardinals, and Romulus and Remus\r\nfor St. Peter and St. Paul. The picture in question has been identified\r\nas one painted by Raphael in 1513-14 for the church of San Silvestro.\r\n\r\nNote 282 page 149. ‘Aught else ... upon thy shoulders,’ i.e., a head.\r\nThe Cato referred to was probably MARCUS PORCIUS CATO UTICENSIS, (born\r\n95 B.C., died 46 B.C.), the Roman philosopher and patriot who espoused\r\nthe cause of Pompey, and committed suicide on hearing of Cæsar’s victory\r\nat Thapsus.\r\n\r\nNote 283 page 150. This queen must have been Isabella the Catholic; see\r\nnote 391.\r\n\r\nNote 284 page 150. RAFAELLO DE’ PAZZI, (born 1471, died 1512), was a\r\nnative of Florence, but was bred away from his home, doubtless owing to\r\nthe proscription of his family for participation in the Pazzi conspiracy\r\nagainst Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici. Having fought for Cesare Borgia\r\nand later for Julius II, he was captured by the French in 1511, and was\r\nslain the following year in the battle of Ravenna.\r\n\r\nNote 285 page 150. THE PRIOR OF MESSINA is now identified by Cian as a\r\nSpanish soldier, Don Pedro de Cuña, who was killed at the battle of\r\nRavenna in 1512.\r\n\r\nNote 286 page 151. Of PAOLO TOLOSA nothing more is known than is\r\ncontained in the text.\r\n\r\nNote 287 page 151. Like purple in Roman times, rose was the aristocratic\r\ncolour at this period. Cosimo is reported by Machiavelli (_Storia\r\nFiorentina_, vii, 6) to have said that “two ells of rose-coloured cloth\r\nmake a man of quality.”\r\n\r\nNote 288 page 151. GIANOTTO DE’ PAZZI is regarded by Cian as possibly\r\nidentical with a certain Florentine, Giovanni de’ Pazzi, who was born in\r\n1476 and died in 1528.\r\n\r\nNote 289 page 151. Of ANTONIO RIZZO nothing more is known than is\r\ncontained in the text.\r\n\r\nNote 290 page 151. ‘The renunciation of a benefice,’ i.e. the notarial\r\ndeed or testament by which a priest resigned his benefice or prebend in\r\nfavour of someone else.\r\n\r\nNote 291 page 151. ANTONIO TORELLO, (died 1536), was private chamberlain\r\nto Julius II and Leo X, who conferred a canonry and several prebends\r\nupon him in 1514. In the briefs he is designated as a priest of the\r\ndiocese of Foglino, and is given certain benefices there, which had\r\nfallen vacant on the death of another priest. We thus infer that Torello\r\nmust have been familiar with the subject referred to in the text. He was\r\nmade a Roman citizen in 1530.\r\n\r\nNote 292 page 151. These two hunchbacks have not been identified. “The\r\nWheel” (_la Ruota_ or _Rota della Giustizia_, or simply _la Rota_) was\r\nthe highest civil and criminal court of Rome prior to 1870. Its name may\r\nhave originated in the circular arrangement of the judges’ (auditors’)\r\nseats (compare the _hemicyclium_ of Cicero’s time), or possibly in a\r\nwheel-shaped porphyry figure set in the pavement of the hall where they\r\nsat. The play is of course on the double meaning of the word _torto_,\r\ncrooked, wrong.\r\n\r\nNote 293 page 151. LATINO GIOVENALE DE’ MANETTI, (born 1486; died 1553),\r\nwas a native of Rome, and a canon of St. Peter’s, but being of minor\r\nrank he had a wife and children. He held various offices, including that\r\nof Commissary General of Roman Antiquities, and was employed in several\r\npapal embassies. A writer of Latin and Italian verse, he was a friend of\r\nCastiglione, Bembo and Bibbiena, and is mentioned in the autobiography\r\nof Cellini, who says that he “had a pretty big dash of the fool in\r\nhim,”—apparently because he presumed to improve one of the sculptor’s\r\ndesigns for a crucifix.\r\n\r\nNote 294 page 152. PERALTA is regarded by Cian as probably identical\r\nwith a certain Captain Luijse Galliego de Peralta, who bore a letter\r\n(1521) from Castiglione at Rome to the Marquess Federico of Mantua, then\r\nfighting against the French. In this letter Castiglione speaks of having\r\nknown Peralta for years as “a man of character and a valiant.” Cian\r\nregards him as identical also with a certain Colonel Peralta, whose\r\ndeath at the battle of Frosinone is mentioned (in a letter of 1526)\r\namong those of other Spaniards.\r\n\r\nMOLART is identified by Cian as the French soldier of fortune, “Molard,”\r\nwho commanded a battalion of Gascons at the battle of Ravenna (11 April\r\n1512), and who fell there bravely fighting by the side of Gaston de\r\nFoix.\r\n\r\nALDANA afterwards served under the Marquess of Mantua at Pavia in 1522,\r\nhaving been summoned (as was Castiglione also) from Rome at the head of\r\nhis company.\r\n\r\nNote 295 page 152. The duel in question is thus described by Branthôme\r\nin his Discourse on Duels: “The Grand Master de Chaumont, the King’s\r\nLieutenant in the State of Milan, also allowed a duel to two Spaniards\r\nwho had asked it of him. The name of one was Signor Peralta, who had\r\nformerly been in the King of France’s service, ... and the other\r\nSpaniard was called Captain Aldana. Their combat was on horse, _à la\r\ngenette_ (jennet), with rapier and dagger and three darts to each man.\r\nPeralta’s second was another Spaniard, and Aldana’s was the gentle\r\nCaptain Molart. It had snowed so much that their encounter took place in\r\nthe Piazza at Parma, from which the snow had been cleared, and there\r\nbeing no other barriers than the snow, each of the two combatants did\r\nhis duty right well. And at last my lord de Chaumont, who had appointed\r\nthe ground and was umpire, caused them to retire with equal honour.”\r\n\r\nNote 296 page 152. Cian inclines to regard this Master MARCANTONIO as\r\nidentical with a certain eccentric physician of the same name, who lived\r\nat Urbino and was the author of a fantastic law book and a long comedy.\r\nOf BOTTONE DA CESENA nothing more is known than is contained in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\nNote 297 page 152. ‘Three sticks,’ i.e., the gallows.\r\n\r\nNote 298 page 152. Of the three persons bearing the name ANDREA COSCIA\r\nand known to have lived at this time, it is uncertain which one is here\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nNote 299 page 152. A MS. copy of THE COURTIER contains the following\r\npassage: “Again a Venetian (forgive me, messer Pietro), coming to visit\r\nmy lady Maddalena, sister to my lady Duchess,—as soon as he was near he\r\noffered her his hand, but without removing his cap. My lady Maddalena\r\ndrew back a step, and drew back her hand too, saying: ‘Gentle Sir, put\r\non your cap; cover your head.’ He still advanced and offered his hand;\r\nwhereupon she replied: ‘I will never do it, unless you cover.’ Thus the\r\npoor man was so put to shame that he at last removed his cap.” Under\r\nsimilar circumstances Madame Bernhardt is said to have reproved Edward\r\nVII (then Prince of Wales) by feigning not to recognize him with his hat\r\non.\r\n\r\nNote 300 page 152. MY LORD CARDINAL, i.e., Giovanni de’ Medici,\r\nafterwards Leo X, (born 1475; died 1521). He was the second son of\r\nLorenzo de’ Medici and Clarice Orsini, and an elder brother of the\r\nMagnifico of THE COURTIER. Made a cardinal at the age of thirteen, and\r\nexiled from Florence with the rest of his family in 1494, he was present\r\nat the election of Alexander VI, of whose character he is said to have\r\nshown true appreciation at the time by remarking: “We are in the wolf’s\r\njaws; he will gulp us down, unless we make good our flight.” During the\r\nreign of Julius II, he seems to have been subservient to that pontiff,\r\nand in 1511 was a member of the court of six cardinals which acquitted\r\nthe young Duke of Urbino of the charge of murdering Cardinal Alidosi.\r\nThe pontificates of Alexander and Julius had exhausted Italy with wars,\r\nand the Christian world, weary of their scandalous violence, hailed with\r\nrelief the accession of the cultivated and seemingly gentle young\r\nprelate, Giovanni de’ Medici. Of his reign,—so brilliant in art and\r\nletters, so disastrous to the Church,—it is enough to say that the key\r\nis found in the famous phrase with which, on his elevation to the Chair\r\nof St. Peter, he greeted his brother Giuliano: “Let us enjoy the Papacy,\r\nsince God hath given it us.” To him the immortality of the soul was an\r\nopen topic for debate, while he regarded sound Latinity and a ready\r\ntongue as more important than true doctrine and pure living. Sincerely\r\nzealous for the diffusion of liberal knowledge, he was extravagantly\r\nmunificent to artists, scholars and authors. Like all his family, after\r\nthe first Cosimo, he was a poor financier, and on his sudden death he\r\nwas found to have pawned the very jewels of his tiara. His reckless\r\nexpenditure led to the sale of indulgences, and thus in no small degree\r\nto the progress of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LUDOVICO SFORZA\r\n  DUKE OF MILAN\r\n  1451-1508\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a part of Alinari’s photograph (no. 14351) of the marble\r\n    tomb sculptures, now in the Certosa di Pavia near Milan, by\r\n    Cristoforo Solari, known as _il Gobbo_, (died 1540).\r\n\r\nNote 301 page 153. BIAGINO CRIVELLO was one of Duke Ludovico Sforza’s\r\ncaptains, and is mentioned (July 1500) in a list of Sforza adherents who\r\nhad rebelled against Louis XII, and whose possessions were declared\r\nforfeit. The list speaks of him as keeping himself at Mantua and in\r\nVenetian territory, and as owning no attachable property in the\r\nMilanese. In April of the same year an ineffectual demand had been made\r\nupon the Marquess of Mantua for the surrender of Crivello and other\r\nchiefs of the Sforza party.\r\n\r\nNote 302 page 153. THE DUKE, i.e., Ludovico Sforza, “Il Moro,” (born\r\n1451; died 1508), was the fourth son of the Francesco Sforza whom Duke\r\nFederico of Urbino had helped to become Duke of Milan (and whose father,\r\na peasant condottiere, Muzio Attendolo, became known as Sforza by reason\r\nof great personal strength),—and of Bianca Maria, a daughter of the last\r\nVisconti duke of Milan. Early noted for his physical and mental\r\nqualities, Ludovico read and wrote Latin fluently, had a tenacious\r\nmemory, and was a ready speaker. He was tall and of strongly marked\r\nfeatures. Unlike his horrible brother Galeazzo Maria, he shunned\r\nbloodshed. Banished from Milan after his brother’s assassination in\r\n1476, he returned in triumph in 1479, and assumed the guardianship of\r\nhis nephew Giangaleazzo, for whom he chose as bride his sister’s child,\r\nIsabella (see note 396), daughter of Alfonso II of Naples. Having first\r\nsought the hand of Isabella d’Este (see note 397),—who was already\r\nbetrothed to the Marquess of Mantua,—in 1491 he married her younger\r\nsister Beatrice (see note 398), whose influence is by some said to have\r\nled him to aggravate the humiliation of his young nephew and niece, the\r\nrightful duke and duchess. Being threatened by the latter’s father, the\r\nKing of Naples, Ludovico invited Charles VIII to enter Italy (1494) and\r\nassert the Angevine claim to Naples. His unhappy nephew died the same\r\nyear, not without suspicion of having been poisoned by the uncle’s\r\norder, who thereupon assumed the title as well as the despotic power of\r\nduke. Becoming alarmed at the rapid success of the French in Italy, he\r\njoined the league formed against them, and was afterwards punished for\r\nhis treachery by being expelled from Milan by Louis XII and carried to\r\nFrance. It is said that at the time of his capture, the only favour he\r\nasked was to be allowed the use of a volume of Dante. He died a prisoner\r\nin the Castle of Loches, where, after a vain effort to escape, he was\r\nconfined in an underground dungeon. At the height of his prosperity his\r\nrevenues exceeded those of any Italian state except Venice. Policy and\r\nalso his natural taste for intellectual pleasures led him to copy the\r\nMedici in their patronage of art and letters. He aspired to make his\r\ncapital a modern Athens, and sought to attract men of fame and talent\r\nfrom far and wide. Both Leonardo da Vinci and the architect Bramante\r\nwere in his pay.\r\n\r\nNote 303 page 153. Cervia is a little town on the Adriatic (between\r\nRavenna and Rimini). A Dominican, Tommaso Cattanei, was bishop of the\r\ndiocese from 1486 to 1509. The pope referred to in the text was Julius\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNote 304 page 155. ‘Montefiore Inn’ was a proverbial expression for a\r\nbad hostelry.

The modern form of _ballatore_ is _ballerino_.\r\nAlthough the distinction is not free from doubt, there seems to be\r\nreason for believing that _danzare_ was the term applied to the more\r\nstately forms of dance, while _ballare_ was reserved for more animated\r\nmovements. See note 147.\r\n\r\nNote 308 page 157. The Bergamasque was and still is regarded as the\r\nrudest and most rustic of the Italian dialects.\r\n\r\nNote 309 page 157. Except as applied to a small Tuscan stream or torrent\r\n(flowing near Acquapendente and Orvieto, and finally tributary to the\r\nTiber), the name Paglia does not occur in modern Italian geography. In\r\nhis autobiography, Cellini mentions crossing the little stream on his\r\nfirst journey from Siena to Rome. Later in the 16th century, Montaigne\r\nrecords (in his diary of a trip into Italy) having spent the night at\r\n“_La Paille_” (Italian, _Paglia_), and describes it as “a small village\r\nof five or six houses at the foot of several barren and ill-favoured\r\nmountains.”\r\n\r\nNote 310 page 157.

Loreto is a small hill town near Ancona, and is\r\ncelebrated for its pilgrimage shrine of the Sacred House (_Santa Casa_),\r\nwhich was reputed to have been the veritable dwelling of the Virgin,\r\nmiraculously transported by angels from Nazareth, and set down in Italy\r\nin 1294. In 1511 and again in 1524 Castiglione wrote to his mother that\r\nhe was preparing to go to Our Lady of Loreto in fulfilment of a vow. The\r\nname was said to be derived from that of the widow upon whose land the\r\nhouse was deposited by the angels.\r\n\r\nNote 312 page 158.

MONSIGNOR OF SAN PIETRO AD VINCULA was the title of\r\nCardinal Galeatto della Rovere; see note 189.\r\n\r\nNote 314 page 159. MONSIGNOR OF ARAGON was the title of Cardinal\r\nLudovico of Aragon, (born 1474), a natural son of Ferdinand I of Naples,\r\nand a half-brother of Alfonso II (see note 31) and Federico III of\r\nNaples (see note 401). He was not elevated to the purple until 1519;\r\nCastiglione’s mention of him as a cardinal in dialogues supposed to take\r\nplace twelve years earlier, doubtless arose from a natural confusion\r\nbetween the time when and the time of which they were written.\r\n\r\nNote 315 page 159. ‘The _Banchi_’ (Banks) was the name of a street in\r\nRome well known in the 15th and 16th centuries. Containing the offices\r\nof the papal Curia and magistrates, it became a preferred neighbourhood,\r\nand was enriched with fine buildings, among which was the counting-house\r\nof Julius II’s finance minister, Agostino Chigi, the greatest banker of\r\nhis day.\r\n\r\nNote 316 page 159. ‘The Chancery’ (_Cancelleria_) was a palace designed\r\nabout 1500 by Bramante for Cardinal Riario, but at this time used for\r\npublic offices and as the residence of Cardinal Galeotto della Rovere,\r\nwho had enlarged and embellished the building. It was not far from the\r\nBanks.\r\n\r\nNote 317 page 159. San Celso was the name of a street and church near\r\nthe Banks. The saint (Celsus) whose memory is thus perpetuated was born\r\nat what is now Cimiez, near Nice, suffered martyrdom at Rome under Nero,\r\nand was finally put to death (together with his master, St. Nazarius) at\r\nMilan in the year 69.\r\n\r\nNote 318 page 160. CESARE BECCADELLO is regarded by Cian as possibly\r\nidentical with a certain Bolognese, who was the son of Domenico Maria\r\nBeccadello, married Landomia Fasanini, and was living at the papal court\r\nas late as 1559. The Spanish annotator Fabié suggests that he was the\r\nfather (1502) of the author Ludovico Beccadello, who was a follower of\r\nBembo and wrote biographies of Petrarch and others.\r\n\r\nNote 319 page 161. These are characters occurring in the third, sixth\r\nand ninth tales of the Eighth Day, and in the fifth tale of the Ninth\r\nDay.\r\n\r\nNote 320 page 161. This knavish student seems to be identical with a\r\ncertain CAIO CALORIA PONZIO, who was born at Messina. Of his life little\r\nmore is known than that he studied law at Padua between 1479 and 1488,\r\nand, after residing two years at Venice, returned to Sicily. For an\r\naccount of a short poem by him in praise of Venice, and of his dialect\r\ncomedy dedicated to the Marquess of Mantua, see Vittorio Rossi’s _Caio\r\nCaloria Ponzio, e la poesia volgare letteraria di Sicilia nel Secolo\r\nXV_, reprinted (Palermo, 1893) from the _Archivio Storico Siciliano_, N.\r\nS., A., xviii.\r\n\r\nNote 321 page 161. The only belfry at Padua answering to this\r\ndescription is said to be that of San Giacomo.\r\n\r\nNote 322 page 162. GONNELLA. This name was borne by two famous jesters\r\nemployed by the d’Este family. The one here referred to was probably the\r\nlater of the two, who lived at the courts of Dukes Niccolò III and\r\nBorso, was the son of a Florentine glover Bernardo Gonnella, and married\r\none Checca Lapi. The next buffoon referred to was probably LUDOVICO\r\nMELIOLO, who acted as steward to the court of Mantua about 1500, and was\r\na brother of the goldsmith and sculptor Bartolommeo Meliolo (1448-1514).\r\nHe was called “the father of jests.”\r\n\r\nNote 323 page 163. This is an instance of the use of the word _calunnia_\r\n(rendered ‘imputation’) in its primitive sense of malicious accusation\r\nwithout reference to truth or falsity.\r\n\r\nNote 324 page 164. These characters occur in the sixth tale of the Third\r\nDay, and in the seventh and eighth tales of the Seventh Day of\r\nBoccaccio’s “Decameron.”\r\n\r\nNote 325 page 164. The queen here mentioned is of course Isabella the\r\nCatholic; see note 391.\r\n\r\nNote 326 page 164. Fabié says that this COUNTESS OF CASTAGNETA was\r\nBrazaida de Almada, daughter of a Portuguese cavalier Juan Baez de\r\nAlmada and Violante de Castro (of the same nation). She was a\r\nlady-in-waiting to Queen Isabella, and her husband Don Garci Fernandez\r\nManrique (third Count of Castagneta and first Marquess of Aguilar) took\r\npart in the conquest of Granada.\r\n\r\nNote 327 page 167. If unconvinced by the “Decameron,” readers of the\r\n_Corbaccio_ will surely be persuaded of the justice of this opinion.\r\n\r\nNote 328 page 167. According to one form of the legend of Orpheus, his\r\ngrief at the final loss of his wife Eurydice, when his lyre had all but\r\nenabled him to recover her from Hades, led him to treat contemptuously\r\nthe Thracian women, who avenged the insult by tearing him in pieces\r\nunder the excitement of their Bacchanalian orgies.\r\n\r\nNote 329 page 167. ‘Braccesque leave’ (_una licentia bracciesca_ in the\r\nAldine folio of 1528, and _una licentia Bracciesca_ in the more\r\ncorrectly printed Aldine folio of 1545) is a phrase derived from the\r\nname of Braccio Fortebracci, a captain who was famous for his violence\r\nto friend and foe, and whose followers were called Bracceschi. To give a\r\nman Braccesque leave meant to dismiss him with blows.\r\n\r\nNote 330 page 169. Although in this and a few other passages,\r\nCastiglione uses _virtù_ in the sense of our “virtue,” he more often\r\ngives it its etymological meaning of “manliness,” which the present\r\ntranslator has generally rendered by “worth.” In considering a word like\r\nthis, we must take into account the character of him who uses it. To\r\nMachiavelli, as no doubt to most of his contemporaries in Italy, _virtù_\r\nmeant simply that combination of strength, courage, tenacity and cunning\r\nthat enables a man to achieve his ends,—whether good or bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                NOTES TO THE THIRD BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n\r\nNote 331 page 171. Achaia, here used as synonymous with Greece, was the\r\nname given to that country when conquered by the Romans and made a\r\nprovince. Olympia was not in Achaia proper, but in the adjoining\r\ndistrict of Elis, some forty miles south of the modern Patras. The site\r\nhas been thoroughly excavated by German archæologists, the most noted\r\ndiscovery being that of the “Hermes” of Praxiteles and the “Victory” of\r\nPæonius.\r\n\r\nNote 332 page 172. That is to say, nude. According to the familiar Greek\r\nmyth, Eris (goddess of discord), to avenge her exclusion from the\r\nnuptials of Peleus and Thetis, threw among the wedding guests a golden\r\napple inscribed “To the Fairest.” A dispute arising between Aphrodite,\r\nHera and Athena concerning the apple, Zeus appointed the shepherd Paris\r\nto decide their claims. The prize having been awarded to Aphrodite, she\r\naided Paris to carry off the beautiful Helen of Sparta, and thus gave\r\nrise to the Trojan War.\r\n\r\nNote 333 page 173. The Order of St. Michael was instituted in August\r\n1469, by Louis XI of France, and was highly esteemed down to\r\nCastiglione’s time, but later suffered in estimation, owing to the\r\nfreedom with which membership was bestowed. Francis I wore the insignia\r\nof the order at the battle of Pavia, 1525.\r\n\r\nNote 334 page 173. The Order of the Garter was instituted by Edward III\r\nof England in 1344. He assigned to its use the chapel (at Windsor) of\r\nSt. George, who was its patron saint. Duke Guidobaldo of Urbino having,\r\nlike his father, been made a knight of the order, Castiglione went to\r\nEngland in 1506 to receive the insignia on the duke’s behalf.\r\n\r\nNote 335 page 173. The Order of the Golden Fleece was instituted by Duke\r\nPhilip the Good of Burgundy (paternal grandfather of Charles V’s\r\npaternal grandmother) in 1429 in honour of his third marriage, to\r\nElizabeth of Portugal. Its badge, a golden ram, is shown in our\r\nportraits of Charles V and his grandfather Maximilian I.\r\n\r\nNote 336 page 173. The king of Persia at this time was Ismail Sufi I,\r\n(born 1480; died 1524). He was descended from a family of noted piety,\r\nwhose peculiar beliefs became the origin of the national Persian faith.\r\nHaving been proclaimed shah in 1499, after nearly a century of\r\ndisorderly government by the successors of Timur the Tartar, he spent\r\nmost of his reign in enlarging and assuring his dominions, and founded\r\nthe dynasty that was to rule Persia until 1736. He waged an unsuccessful\r\nwar with Selim I of Turkey, the son and successor of Bajazet II, and\r\ndied while on a pilgrimage to his own father’s tomb. His subjects\r\nrevered him as a saint.\r\n\r\nNote 337 page 174. The ‘Lady whom I know’ is of course the Duchess.\r\n\r\nNote 338 page 175. PYGMALION will be remembered as the legendary\r\nsculptor-king of Cyprus, who fell in love with an ivory statue that he\r\nhad made of a beautiful girl, and prayed to Aphrodite to breathe life\r\ninto it. His prayer being granted, he married the girl, who was called\r\nGalatea.\r\n\r\nNote 339 page 181. The opinions here ascribed to Plato, are found in the\r\nFifth Book of his “Republic,” but seem to have undergone serious change\r\nwhen he wrote his “Laws.”\r\n\r\nNote 340 page 182. The comparative merits of man and woman were much\r\ndiscussed in Greek antiquity and during the Renaissance, and form the\r\nsubject of a copious literature in which Castiglione’s contribution\r\noccupies no unimportant place.\r\n\r\nNote 341 page 184. The reference here is to a fragment of the so-called\r\nOrphic Hymns, beginning: “Jove the End, Jove the Beginning, Jove the\r\nMiddle, all things are of Jove: Jove Male, Immortal Virgin Jove.” In\r\nthis and other respects the theogony to which the name of Orpheus is\r\nattached, is closely related to the most ancient religious systems of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nNote 342 page 185. The author probably refers to Aristotle’s Tenth\r\nProblem.\r\n\r\nNote 343 page 188. The reference here is doubtless to Jerome’s 54th\r\nEpistle (on Widowhood), and to his first tract against Jovinianus, both\r\nwritten about 394 A.D. He was born in what is now the Hungarian town of\r\nStridon about 340, and died in a monastery at Bethlehem 420 A.D. Perhaps\r\nhis best remembered work is the Vulgate or Latin translation of the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nNote 344 page 189. “If not chastely, then discreetly.”\r\n\r\nNote 345 page 190. OCTAVIA, (born 70; died 11 B.C.), was a great-niece\r\nof Julius Cæsar, and became the second wife of the triumvir Mark Antony\r\nfor the purpose (ultimately vain) of cementing the alliance between him\r\nand her brother Augustus. Her beauty, accomplishments and virtues proved\r\nunavailing against the wiles of Cleopatra, who induced Antony to divorce\r\nher. After Antony’s death, she remained true to the interests of his\r\nchildren, including those by his first wife and by Cleopatra. Through\r\nthe two daughters that she bore to Antony, she became the grandmother of\r\nthe Emperor Claudius, and great-grandmother of his predecessor Caligula\r\nand of his successor Nero.\r\n\r\nNote 346 page 190. PORCIA’S first husband was Marcus Bibulus, who was\r\nConsul with Cæsar in 59 B.C. She inherited her father’s republican\r\nprinciples, courage and firm will, and was her second husband Brutus’s\r\nconfidante in the conspiracy against Cæsar. On his death at Philippi in\r\n42 B.C., she put an end to her life.\r\n\r\nNote 347 page 190. CAIA CÆCILIA TANAQUIL appears in Roman legend as the\r\nsecond wife of King Tarquinius Priscus, endowed with prophetic powers,\r\nclosely connected with the worship of the hearth-deity, expert in\r\nhealing, and a model of domestic virtues. The traditional date of her\r\nhusband’s reign is 616-578 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 348 page 190. CORNELIA, the mother of the Gracchi (born about 189\r\nB.C.; died about 110 B.C.), wrote letters that had survived in Cicero’s\r\nday and were prized for their style. Even in her own lifetime the Romans\r\nerected a statue in honour of her virtues. Left a widow with twelve\r\nyoung children, she devoted herself wholly to their training, and\r\nrejected all offers of marriage, including that of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nNote 349 page 191. Plutarch (from whose history the narrative in the\r\ntext is a paraphrase) describes ALEXANDRA as being actuated in her\r\nregency solely by ambitious motives. Her husband, Alexander Jannæus, was\r\nthe son of Johannes Hyrcanus and brother of Aristobulus I, whom he\r\nsucceeded as second King of the Jews after the Babylonish Captivity. His\r\nreign (104-78 B.C.) was marked by atrocities.\r\n\r\nNote 350 page 191. The reference here is to MITHRIDATES VI, Eupator,\r\nKing (120-63 B.C.) of Pontus on the southern shore of the Black Sea. In\r\nthe Life of Lucullus, Plutarch relates that having been utterly defeated\r\nby the Romans in 72 B.C., Mithridates gave order to have his wives\r\nBernice and Monima put to death together with his sisters Statira and\r\nRoxana, in order to prevent them from falling into the hands of the\r\nenemy,—while he himself took refuge with his son-in-law. Statira is\r\ndescribed by Plutarch as grateful to her brother for not forgetting her\r\namid his own anxieties, and for providing her the means of an honourable\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nNote 351 page 191. This HASDRUBAL was the general of the Carthaginians\r\nin their last struggle with Rome. When Scipio captured Carthage in 146\r\nB.C., Hasdrubal surrendered, while it is said that his wife, after\r\nupbraiding him for his weakness, flung herself and her children into the\r\nflames of the burning temple in which they had sought shelter.\r\n\r\nNote 352 page 191. In fact, HARMONIA was Hiero’s granddaughter, and the\r\nwife of a Syracusan named Themistus, who (after the death of Hiero in\r\n215 B.C.) was chosen one of the leaders of the commonwealth and\r\nafterwards perished in a fresh revolution. Death was then decreed\r\nagainst all surviving members of Hiero’s family, and Harmonia was slain\r\ntogether with her aunts, Demarata and Heraclea.\r\n\r\nNote 353 page 192. The reference is of course to the familiar story of\r\nthe obstinate dame who persisted in declaring that a certain rent had\r\nbeen made with scissors, and whose husband vainly tried to change her\r\nmind by plunging her in a pond. Each time she came to the surface, she\r\ncried “Scissors,” until, unable to speak from strangulation, she\r\nstretched forth her hand and made the sign of the instrument with two\r\nfingers. In a coarser form, the story was current in Italy even before\r\nCastiglione’s time.\r\n\r\nNote 354 page 192. The conspiracy in question was discovered in 65 A.D.\r\nTacitus relates that EPICHARIS strangled herself with her girdle while\r\non the way to be tortured a second time.\r\n\r\nNote 355 page 192. LEÆNA was an Athenian _hetaira_ beloved by\r\nAristogeiton. When he and Harmodius had slain the tyrant Hipparchus in\r\n514 B.C., she was supposed to be privy to their plan, and died under\r\ntorture. The statue in question is mentioned by Pausanias and said by\r\nPlutarch (in his essay on Garrulity) to have been placed “upon the gates\r\nof the Acropolis.” Recent archæologists identify its site as being on\r\nthe level of the Acropolis, near the southern inner corner of the\r\nPropylæa.\r\n\r\nNote 356 page 192. Massilia became the modern Marseilles.\r\n\r\nNote 357 page 192. This story is taken from the “Memorable Doings and\r\nSayings” of Valerius Maximus (_flor._ 25 A.D.), in which Castiglione\r\nmistranslates the Latin word _publicè_ (at the public charge) as\r\n_publicamente_ (publicly).\r\n\r\nNote 358 page 192. Of several persons of this name, the one here\r\nreferred to was probably the Roman Consul (14 A.D.),—a patron of\r\nliterature and a friend of Ovid. Had the Magnifico been allowed to\r\nfinish his sentence, he would (following the narrative of Valerius\r\nMaximus) have doubtless added the name of a town in Asia Minor, Julida.\r\n\r\nNote 359 page 195. This story (which was used by Tennyson for his play\r\nof “The Cup”) is found in Plutarch’s tract “Concerning Women’s Virtue,”\r\nwhere the scene is placed in Galatia, in Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nNote 360 page 197. The number of the Sibyls is usually reckoned as ten:\r\nPersian (or Babylonian), Libyan, Phrygian, Delphian, Cimmerian,\r\nErythræan, Samian, Trojan, Tiburtine, and Cumæan,—of which the last was\r\nthe most famous.\r\n\r\nNote 361 page 197. ASPASIA, (_flor._ 440 B.C.), was born at Miletus in\r\nAsia Minor, but in her youth removed to Athens, where she was celebrated\r\nfor her talents and beauty, and became the mistress of Pericles, one of\r\nwhose orations she is said by Plato to have composed. Her house was the\r\ncentre of intellectual society, and was even frequented by Athenian\r\nmatrons and their husbands.\r\n\r\nNote 362 page 197. DIOTIMA was a probably fictitious priestess of\r\nMantinea in the Peloponnesus, reputed to have been the instructress of\r\nSocrates. Her supposed opinions as to the origin, nature and objects of\r\nlife, form the subject of Plato’s “Symposium.”\r\n\r\nNote 363 page 197. NICOSTRATE or Carmenta was a prophetic and healing\r\ndivinity, supposed to be of Greek origin. Having tried to persuade her\r\nson Evander to kill his father Hermes, she fled with the boy to Italy,\r\nwhere she was said to have given the Roman form to the fifteen\r\ncharacters of the Greek alphabet that Evander introduced into Latium.\r\n\r\nNote 364 page 197. This ‘preceptress ... to Pindar’ was MYRTIS, a lyric\r\npoetess of the 6th century B.C. She is mentioned in a fragment by\r\nCorinna as having competed with Pindar. Statues were erected to her in\r\nvarious parts of Greece, and she was counted among the nine lyric muses.\r\n\r\nNote 365 page 197. Of PINDAR’S life little more is known than that he\r\nresided chiefly at Thebes, and that the dates of his birth and death\r\nwere about 522 and 443 B.C. respectively. Practically all his extant\r\npoems are odes in commemoration of victories in the public games.\r\n\r\nNote 366 page 197. The Greek poetess CORINNA (5th century B.C.) was a\r\nnative of Tanagra in Bœotia. She is said to have won prizes five times\r\nin competition with Pindar. Only a few fragments of her verse remain.\r\n\r\nNote 367 page 197. SAPPHO flourished about 600 B.C., and seems to have\r\nbeen born and to have lived chiefly at Mitylene. She enjoyed unique\r\nrenown among the ancients: on hearing one of her poems, Solon prayed\r\nthat he might not see death before he had learned it; Plato called her\r\nthe Tenth Muse; and Aristotle placed her on a par with Homer. For a\r\nrecently discovered and interesting fragment of her verse, see the Egypt\r\nExploration Fund’s “Oxyrhynchus Papyri,” Part I, p. 11.\r\n\r\nNote 368 page 198. Castiglione here follows Plutarch. Pliny, on the\r\nother hand, affirms that Roman women were obliged to kiss their male\r\nrelatives, in order that it might be known whether they had transgressed\r\nthe law forbidding them to drink wine.\r\n\r\nNote 369 page 199. This paragraph is taken almost literally from Livy,\r\nexcepting the incident of the babies borne in arms, which Castiglione\r\nseems to have invented.\r\n\r\nNote 370 page 199. TITUS TATIUS was the legendary king of the Sabines.\r\nHis forces were so strong that Romulus was driven back to the Saturnian\r\nHill, which had previously been fortified and which became the site of\r\nthe Capitol. The familiar story is to the effect that Tarpeia (daughter\r\nto the captain of the fortress), being dazzled by the Sabines’ golden\r\nbracelets, promised to betray the hill to them if they would give her\r\nthe ornaments on their left arms. Accordingly she admitted the enemy at\r\nnight, but when she claimed her reward, they threw down upon her the\r\nshields that they wore on the left arm, and thus crushed her to death.\r\nHer infamy is preserved in the name of the neighbouring Tarpeian Rock,\r\nfrom which traitors were flung down.\r\n\r\nNote 371 page 199. There is said to be no historical mention of any\r\nRoman temple to _Venus Armata_. Castiglione may have had in mind a\r\npassage in the “Christian Cicero” (Lactantius Firmianus, who wrote about\r\n300 A.D.), recording the dedication by the Spartans of a temple and\r\nstatue to the Armed Venus in memory of their women’s brave repulse of a\r\nsudden attack by the Messenians during the absence of the Spartan army.\r\n\r\nNote 372 page 199. _Calva_ (bald) was one of the Roman Venus’s most\r\nancient epithets, under which she had two temples near the Capitol. Of\r\nthe several explanations of this appellation, Castiglione seems to refer\r\nto the one which interprets it as the memorial of the Roman women’s\r\nheroism in cutting off their hair to make bow-strings for the men during\r\na siege by the Gauls.\r\n\r\nNote 373 page 200. In his life of Camillus (died 365 B.C.), Plutarch\r\ngives a legendary account of the origin of the Handmaidens’ Festival. At\r\na time when the Romans were ill prepared for war, the Latins sent to\r\ndemand of them a number of free-born maidens in marriage. This was\r\nsuspected as a trick to obtain hostages, but no method of foiling it was\r\ndevised until Tutula, a slave girl, advised the magistrates to send her\r\nto the Latin camp along with some of the most beautiful handmaidens in\r\nrich attire. This was done, and at night, when her companions had stolen\r\naway the enemies’ weapons, Tutula displayed a signal torch agreed on\r\nwith the Romans, who at once sallied forth, easily captured the Latin\r\ncamp, and put most of the enemy to the sword.\r\n\r\nNote 374 page 200. The Romans are said to have wearied of Cicero’s\r\nself-praise for his suppression of the Cataline conspiracy (63 B.C.).\r\nThe woman in question was a Roman patrician, Fulvia by name, who was the\r\nmistress of one of the conspirators and divulged the plot to Cicero.\r\n\r\nNote 375 page 200. This DEMETRIUS (II) was grandson to the Demetrius I\r\nalready mentioned (see note 136), and ruled over Macedonia from about\r\n239 to about 229 B.C. His son, PHILIP V (237-179 B.C.), joined Hannibal\r\nin a war against Rome, which finally ended in the downfall of the\r\nMacedonian monarchy and the captivity of his son and successor Perseus\r\n(167 B.C.). The incident mentioned in the text is narrated by Plutarch\r\nin his work on “Women’s Virtue,” as also is the instance next cited by\r\nCastiglione, who however reverses the order of events.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANNE OF BRITTANY\r\n  QUEEN OF FRANCE\r\n  1476-1514\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a negative, specially made by Alinari through the courtesy\r\n    of Professor I. B. Supino, of a medal, in the National Museum at\r\n    Florence, by Jean Perreal (1460?-1528?). See note 387.\r\n\r\nNote 376 page 200. Erythræ was an important city on the west coast of\r\nAsia Minor opposite Chios. The nearest approach to ‘Leuconia’ in ancient\r\ngeography is the distant town Leuconum in what is now Slavonia, between\r\nthe Danube and the Save.\r\n\r\nNote 377 page 201. Plutarch’s version of this story adds that in honour\r\nof the Persian women’s bravery on this occasion, Cyrus (559-529 B.C.)\r\ndecreed that whenever the king returned from a long journey, each woman\r\nshould receive a ring of gold.\r\n\r\nNote 378 page 201. One of Plutarch’s minor works is entitled “Apothegms\r\nand Famous Sayings of Spartan Women,” and Castiglione’s contemporary\r\nMarcantonio Casanova wrote two Latin distiches on “The Spartan Mother\r\nSlaying Her Son.”\r\n\r\nNote 379 page 201. Saguntum, the modern Murviedro, was a city of Greek\r\norigin on the eastern coast of Spain. After a desperate siege of nearly\r\neight months, it was captured by Hannibal in 219 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 380 page 201. The reference here is to the victory, at Vercelli\r\nnear Milan, by which the Roman general CAIUS MARIUS repelled the advance\r\nof the Cimbri into Italy, 101 B.C. The sacred fire (supposed to have\r\nbeen brought from Troy by Æneas as the symbol of Vesta, the hearth\r\ndeity) was kept alive at Rome by six virgins.\r\n\r\nNote 381 page 202. AMALASONTHA, (498-535 A.D.), was the daughter of\r\nTheodoric the Great, and regent of the East Gothic kingdom from his\r\ndeath in 526 until her own. After a prosperous reign she is said to have\r\nbeen strangled by her cousin and second husband Theodatus, at the\r\ninstigation of the Empress Theodora, the wife of Justinian.\r\n\r\nNote 382 page 202. THEODOLINDA, daughter of Duke Garibald of Bavaria,\r\nmarried (589 A.D.) Autharis, King of the Lombards, and on his death in\r\nthe following year, she married Duke Agilulph of Turin, who was\r\nproclaimed king in 591. She died in 625, after exercising the regency in\r\nthe name of her son. Her virtue, wisdom and beauty were extolled; she\r\nwas active in her labours on behalf of Christianity; and she carried on\r\na correspondence with St. Gregory, who was pope from 590 to 604.\r\n\r\nNote 383 page 202. The THEODORA here referred to is doubtless the wife,\r\nnot of Justinian, but of Theophilus, Emperor of Constantinople 829-842.\r\nShe died in 867, and was canonized by the Greek Church.\r\n\r\nNote 384 page 202. COUNTESS MATILDA, (1046-1115), one of the most famous\r\nheroines of the Middle Ages, was the daughter of Duke Boniface of\r\nTuscany and Beatrice of Lorraine. She ruled over Tuscany and a large\r\npart of northern Italy, espoused the papal cause against the Emperor,\r\nand exercised an important influence upon the politics of her time. She\r\nwas noted also for her religious zeal, energy, and austere yet gentle\r\nand cultivated life. Count Ludovico’s supposed descent from her paternal\r\nuncle Conrad is now regarded as doubtful.\r\n\r\nNote 385 page 202. Among the eminent women here referred to, we may\r\nnote: Duke Guidobaldo’s grandfather’s wife, Caterina Colonna, (died\r\n1438), who was a great-aunt of Vittoria Colonna, and was praised as\r\n“noble, beautiful, discreet, charming, gentle and generous”; his\r\ngreat-aunt Battista di Montefeltro, (died 1450), who, having been\r\ndeserted by her worthless Malatesta husband, wrote moral essays and\r\npoetry, and was celebrated for her piety and mental gifts, as well as\r\nfor her learning and literary accomplishments; his aunt, Brigida Sueva\r\ndi Montefeltro, (born 1428), who, after enduring for twelve years the\r\nbrutalities of her Sforza husband, became an abbess and ultimately\r\nreceived the honour of beatification,—her remains being revered as a\r\nsacred relic; another aunt of his, Violante di Montefeltro, (born 1430),\r\nwho was famous for her talents and beauty; his maternal grandmother,\r\nCostanza da Varano, (born 1428), was a granddaughter of the Battista\r\nabove mentioned, inherited much of that lady’s taste for learning,\r\nbecame the associate of scholars and philosophers, wrote Latin orations,\r\nepistles and poems, and (by her marriage to a brother of the first\r\nSforza duke of Milan) became the mother of Duke Guidobaldo’s own mother,\r\nBattista Sforza, (born 1446), who rivalled her ancestresses’\r\nattainments, administered her husband’s government judiciously during\r\nhis frequent absences, and was regarded as beautiful, although tiny in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nNote 386 page 202. Perhaps the most famous woman of the Gonzaga family\r\nwas “my lady Duchess’s” great-aunt, Cecilia Gonzaga, (born 1425), who\r\nshared with her four brothers the tuition of the celebrated Vittorino da\r\nFeltre, wrote Greek with remarkable purity at the age of ten, became a\r\nnun at nineteen, devoted her life to religious and literary exercises,\r\nand was regarded as one of the most learned women of her time. Her niece\r\n(?), Barbara Gonzaga, (born about 1455), was educated with especial\r\ncare, became Duchess of Würtemberg, induced her husband to found the\r\nUniversity of Tübingen, and ruled the duchy as regent after his death.\r\n\r\nOf the Este family, two aunts (Ginevra, born 1419, and Bianca Maria,\r\nborn 1440) of Isabella and Beatrice d’Este (see notes 397 and 398), were\r\nfamous for their knowledge of Latin and Greek, in which languages the\r\nyounger wrote both prose and verse, besides being an accomplished\r\nmusician, dancer and needlewoman.\r\n\r\nOf the Pio family, Castiglione doubtless had in mind the celebrated Alda\r\nPia da Carpi, who was a sister of Aldus’s pupil and patron Alberto Pio,\r\naunt of Count Ludovico Pio of THE COURTIER (see note 46), and mother of\r\nthe still more celebrated poetess Veronica Gambara, (born 1485).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MARGARITA OF AUSTRIA\r\n  1480-1530\r\n]\r\n\r\nHead enlarged from Braun’s photograph (no. 13.796) of an anonymous\r\n    portrait group, in the Palace at Versailles, representing the\r\n    Emperor Maximilian I and his family.\r\n\r\nNote 387 page 202. ANNE DE BRETAGNE, (born 1476; died 1514), was the\r\ndaughter and heiress of Duke Francis II of Brittany, which became\r\npermanently united to the crown of France through her marriages to\r\nCharles VIII (1492) and Louis XII (1499). Castiglione’s praise of her\r\nseems to have been in the main justified. Although sometimes vindictive,\r\nshe was generous, virtuous beyond the standard of her time, and carried\r\ncultivation to the verge of pedantry. She surrounded herself with\r\nartists, historians, minstrels and poets, and formed a collection of\r\nMSS. and other precious objects, largely the spoils of her husbands’\r\nItalian campaigns. Branthôme called her “the worthiest and most\r\nhonourable queen that has been since Queen Blanche, mother of the king\r\nSt. Louis, and so wise and virtuous.”\r\n\r\nNote 388 page 202. CHARLES VIII, (born 1470; died 1498), was the son of\r\nLouis XI and Charlotte of Savoy. Having succeeded his father in 1483,\r\nand assumed royal power in 1491, he married Anne of Brittany and soon\r\nset about enforcing his pretensions to the crown of Naples, transmitted\r\nto him through his father and cousin from René of Provence, to whom the\r\nlast Angevine ruler had devised the kingdom in 1435. As we have seen,\r\nthe immediate cause of the invasion of Italy (1494) was a request from\r\nDuke Ludovico Sforza of Milan and Pope Alexander VI. Although the\r\nexpedition was undertaken without adequate preparation and conducted\r\nwith incredible foolhardiness,—continuous good fortune together with the\r\nmutual jealousies of Italian princes and the decadence of Italian\r\nmilitary power enabled Charles to enter Milan, Florence and Rome without\r\nhindrance, to seize Naples almost unopposed, and (when threatened by a\r\npowerful league formed against him) to retire northwards, to defeat the\r\nItalians at Fornovo, and finally to reach France in safety, October\r\n1495. His garrisons were driven from Naples in the following year, but\r\nhis foray had the immediate result of expelling the Medici from\r\nFlorence, and the far more important consequence of revealing to the\r\nrest of Europe the wealth and helplessness of Italy,—thus paving the way\r\nfor the subsequent invasions with which the peninsula was scourged\r\nduring the 16th Century. The remainder of Charles’s life was given up to\r\ninglorious ease and pleasure. A son of the painter Mantegna thus\r\ndescribes him: “A very ill-favoured face, with great goggle eyes, an\r\naquiline nose offensively large, and a head disfigured by a few sparse\r\nhairs;” while Duke Ludovico Sforza said of him: “The man is young, and\r\nhis conduct meagre, nor has he any form or method of council.” His own\r\nambassador, Commines, wrote: “He was little in stature and of small\r\nsense, very timid in speech, owing to the way in which he had been\r\ntreated as a child, and as feeble in mind as he was in body, but the\r\nkindest and gentlest creature alive.”\r\n\r\nNote 389 page 202. MARGARITA OF AUSTRIA, (born 1480; died 1530), was the\r\ndaughter of the Emperor Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy, and a native\r\nof Brussels. Having been betrothed to the Dauphin Charles (VIII) and\r\nthen rejected by that prince in favour of Anne of Brittany, she married\r\n(1497) the Infant Juan of Castile, but soon lost both husband and child.\r\nIn 1501 she married Duke Filiberto of Savoy, and after four years of\r\nhappiness again became a widow. In 1507 she was entrusted by her father\r\nwith the government of the Low Countries and the care of her nephew\r\nCharles (see note 462). She did much to further the progress of\r\nagriculture and commerce in her dominions, and besides showing a lofty\r\nspirit and no little political sagacity, she was a patroness of art and\r\nletters, and composed a great number of poems in French, most of which\r\nare said to be lost. Her correspondence with her father has been\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nNote 390 page 202. MAXIMILIAN I, Emperor of Germany, (born 1459; died\r\n1519), was the son of the Emperor Frederick III of Hapsburg and Eleanora\r\nof Portugal. In 1477 he married Charles the Bold’s daughter and heiress,\r\nMary of Burgundy, who bore him five children and died in 1482. On the\r\ndeath of his father in 1493, he was elected Emperor, and soon afterwards\r\nmarried Bianca Maria, niece of Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan. He was a\r\nmember of the league that forced Charles VIII to retire from Italy\r\n(1495), of the League of Cambray against Venice (1508), and of the Holy\r\nLeague (1511) for the expulsion of Louis XII from Italy. Although\r\nderiving little profit or honour from these and other foreign\r\nenterprises, he contrived by prudent marriages to add Bohemia and\r\nHungary to his empire and to make Spain a possession of his family. He\r\nalso effected many reforms in his government, and even founded several\r\nimportant institutions, such as a postal service and a permanent\r\nmilitia. From his youth he showed a taste for study, became a patron of\r\nscholars, poets and artists, and enriched the Universities of Vienna and\r\nIngolstadt. Besides being an accomplished if not very successful\r\nsoldier, he was the author of works on gardening, hunting and\r\nagriculture, as well as on military science.\r\n\r\nNote 391 page 202. ISABELLA THE CATHOLIC, (born 1451; died 1504), was\r\nthe daughter and heiress of Juan II of Castile. Having been trained in\r\nretirement to habits of religious devotion, she married (1469) Ferdinand\r\nof Aragon, with whom she succeeded jointly to her father’s crown in\r\n1474, but was able to gain complete possession of her dominions only in\r\n1479, the same year in which her husband succeeded his father as King of\r\nAragon. Under her rule the Inquisition was established in Castile\r\n(1480), but she recoiled before its horrors and was reconciled to its\r\ncontinuance only by the direct assurance of Pope Sixtus IV. In 1481\r\nbegan the long war, which (largely owing to her energy and perseverance)\r\nresulted in the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, and in which she is\r\nsaid to have organized the earliest military hospitals. The story of her\r\nnoble patronage of Columbus is familiar. Her later years were clouded by\r\nthe loss of two of her three children, including her only son, and by\r\nthe unhappy conjugal life and mental disorder of her daughter, Juana,\r\nthe mother of Charles V. Castiglione’s praise of Isabella’s lofty\r\nqualities is not a little justified by the facts of her life. In\r\npersonal appearance, she is said to have been agreeable rather than\r\nhandsome; her features were regular, her green eyes vivacious, her\r\ncomplexion olive, her hair reddish blond, and her stature above the\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BEATRICE OF ARAGON\r\n  QUEEN OF HUNGARY\r\n  1457-1508\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom a negative, specially made by the brothers Moreau with the kind\r\n    permission of M. Gustave Dreyfus, of an anonymous bust in his\r\n    collection at Paris.\r\n\r\nNote 392 page 202. FERDINAND THE CATHOLIC, (born 1452; died 1516), was\r\nthe son of Juan II of Navarre and Aragon, and is justly regarded as the\r\nfounder of the Spanish monarchy. The means employed by him in building\r\nup his power were perfidy towards other rulers and ruthless oppression\r\nof his own people. Besides the other events of his reign, noted above,\r\nmention should be made of his cruel expulsion of the Jews from Spain in\r\n1492. These and his other persecutions, supposed at the time to be\r\nactuated by zeal for pure religion, were in fact chiefly a source of\r\nrevenue, and the policy thus inaugurated,—of stifling the commerce, the\r\nindustry, the free thought and the energy of the nation at the beginning\r\nof its greatness,—is now seen to have been one of the important causes\r\nof its decline.\r\n\r\nNote 393 page 204. Of these two remarkable queens, one was doubtless\r\nFederico III’s widow, the Isabella del Balzo who is mentioned below (see\r\nnote 400). The other may possibly have been her predecessor Joanna, the\r\naunt and widow of Ferdinand II; or (more probably) Ippolita Maria, who\r\nwas a daughter of the first Sforza duke of Milan and wife of Ferdinand\r\nII’s father and predecessor Alfonso II, and of whom Dennistoun says (ii,\r\n122): “It was for this princess that Constantine Lascaris composed the\r\nearliest Greek Grammar; and in the convent library of Sta. Croce at Rome\r\nthere is a transcript by her of Cicero’s _De Senectute_, followed by a\r\njuvenile collection of Latin apothegms curiously indicative of her\r\ncharacter and studies.”\r\n\r\nNote 394 page 204. BEATRICE OF ARAGON, (born 1457; died 1508), was the\r\ndaughter of Ferdinand I of Naples and Isabelle de Clermont. In 1476 she\r\nmarried Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. On his death in 1490, she\r\nmarried Ladislas II of Bohemia, who for a time prevented the succession\r\nof Matthias’s natural son John. However the youth attained the Hungarian\r\nthrone with the aid of the Emperor Maximilian; whereupon Beatrice was\r\nrepudiated by Ladislas and her marriage was annulled by Alexander VI. In\r\n1501 she returned to Italy, resided at Ischia and died childless. Like\r\nher elder sister, the Duchess Eleanora of Ferrara (see note 399), she\r\nwas a woman of cultivation and taste, and in spite of her political\r\nintrigues, she is praised for having done much to strengthen the\r\nintellectual bonds between Italy and Hungary, to which country she\r\ninvited Italian poets, scholars and artists.\r\n\r\nNote 395 page 204. MATTHIAS CORVINUS, (born 1443; died 1490), was the\r\nson of the famous Hungarian general János Hunyadi, and in 1458 was\r\nproclaimed King of Hungary by the soldiers whom his father had so often\r\nled to victory. His life was a nearly continuous series of great\r\nenterprises, among the most noted of which were his campaigns against\r\nthe Turks and his siege and capture (1485) of Vienna, where he\r\nthereafter resided chiefly and died. By no means the least part of his\r\nfame was won by the ardour with which he advanced the cause of science,\r\nart and letters in his country, and bestowed upon his people not only an\r\nenlightened code of laws but also the benefits of Renaissance culture.\r\nHe introduced printing into Hungary, and was the founder of a\r\nmagnificent public library at Buda Pest, containing fifty thousand\r\nvolumes, for the most part MSS. which he caused to be copied in Italy\r\nand the East.\r\n\r\nNote 396 page 204. ISABELLA OF ARAGON, (born 1470; died 1524), was the\r\ndaughter of Alfonso II of Naples and Ippolita Maria, daughter of the\r\nfirst Sforza duke of Milan. In 1489 she made a splendid entry into Milan\r\nas the bride of her own cousin Giangaleazzo Sforza, whose rights as duke\r\nwere gradually usurped by his uncle Ludovico il Moro. This usurpation\r\nhas been regarded as partly due to the ambition of Ludovico’s young\r\nwife, Beatrice d’Este (see note 398), who could not endure the\r\nprecedence rightfully belonging to Isabella. As has been seen, it was to\r\nprotect himself against the wrath of Isabella’s father and grandfather,\r\nthat Ludovico invited Charles VIII into Italy as his ally. When Charles\r\nreached Pavia, he had to endure the pathetic spectacle of his forlorn\r\ncousin Giangaleazzo (they were sisters’ sons) in prison, and to hear the\r\npiteous pleadings of the beautiful Isabella, who fell at his feet and\r\nbesought him to have mercy on her husband. Her appeal was withstood, and\r\nLudovico of course had no scruple in setting aside the rights of her\r\ninfant children. Fresh trials awaited her in her native country, to\r\nwhich she returned in 1500, and from which her family had been expelled.\r\n\r\nNote 397 page 204. ISABELLA D’ESTE, (born 1474; died 1539), was the\r\noldest child of Duke Ercole I of Ferrara and Eleanora of Aragon. Having\r\nhad Mario Equicola as preceptor, she married the Marquess Gianfrancesco\r\nGonzaga (see note 446) in 1490, her early betrothal to whom prevented\r\nher from becoming the wife of Ludovico Sforza, the duke of Milan, who\r\nsoon afterwards married her sister Beatrice. At Mantua she continued her\r\nliterary and artistic training, and her court became one of the\r\nbrightest and most active centres of Italian culture. The chief poets\r\nand painters of the time laboured for her or were her friends. Being for\r\nyears in her husband’s service, Castiglione knew her closely, maintained\r\na frequent exchange of letters with her, and is only one of many who\r\npraise her beauty, her intellect, and her moral qualities; she may be\r\nregarded as the most splendid incarnation of the Renaissance ideal of\r\nwoman. Her long friendship with her sister-in-law, “My lady Duchess,”\r\nhas been already mentioned. Some interesting details have survived as to\r\nher manner of ordering a picture. Having chosen a subject, she had it\r\nset forth in writing by some humanist of her court. These specifications\r\nwere then given to the painter chosen for the purpose, and he was\r\nfurnished with minute directions as to the placing of the figures and\r\nthe distribution of light, and required to make a preliminary sketch. As\r\nthe painting was often intended for a specific space, she took great\r\ncare to secure the exact dimensions desired, by providing two pieces of\r\nribbon to show the precise height and breadth of the picture. Isabella’s\r\nbrilliant career, and especially her close relations with the chief men\r\nof her day and her weighty influence upon contemporary politics, are the\r\nsubject of many scholarly volumes and interesting articles written\r\njointly by Alessandro Luzio of Mantua and Rodolfo Renier of Turin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ISABELLA OF ARAGON\r\n  DUCHESS OF MILAN\r\n  1470-1524\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a negative, specially made by Alinari through the courtesy\r\n    of Professor I. B. Supino, of a medal, in the National Museum at\r\n    Florence, by Giancristoforo Romano (1465?-1512). See Armand’s _Les\r\n    Médailleurs Italiens_, ii, 54, no. 1.\r\n\r\nNote 398 page 204. BEATRICE D’ESTE, (born 1475; died 1497), married\r\nLudovico Sforza, Duke Regent of Milan, in the same year (1491) in which\r\nhis niece Anna Sforza married Beatrice’s brother Alfonso, the future\r\nhusband of Lucrezia Borgia. Younger, apparently less beautiful, and\r\ncertainly less accomplished than her sister Isabella, Beatrice\r\nencouraged her husband’s patronage of art and letters, and took part in\r\nhis turbid political schemes. It will perhaps never be determined\r\nprecisely to what extent she was responsible for his treatment of his\r\nyoung nephew and of the latter’s wife (see note 396), and for the\r\ndisasters to Italy that ensued, but she is known to have exercised a\r\ngreat ascendency over her husband’s mind, and he is said to have spent\r\nat her tomb the last night before his final capture and downfall. After\r\nthe expulsion of the French from Italy in 1512, her sons Maximilian and\r\nFrancesco Maria successively held the duchy for a time, until it passed\r\ninto the hands of Spain in 1535. For an account of her life, the reader\r\nis referred to Mrs. Henry Ady’s recently published “Beatrice d’Este,\r\nDuchess of Milan; a Study of the Renaissance,” which owes much to the\r\nlabours of Luzio and Renier.\r\n\r\nNote 399 page 205. ELEANORA OF ARAGON, (born 1450; died 1493), was the\r\nelder sister of the Beatrice who married Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. A\r\nprojected union with Ludovico Sforza (who afterwards married her\r\ndaughter) having been abandoned, she became in 1473 the wife of Duke\r\nErcole I of Ferrara, and bore him two daughters and four sons. Other\r\ncontemporary accounts confirm the praise bestowed upon her by\r\nCastiglione, and show her to have been a woman of rare merit, manly\r\ncourage and enlightened culture. Fond of music, and herself a player\r\nupon the harp, she seems to have been a discriminating patroness of art\r\nand letters, and at the same time to have taken an active share in the\r\nserious cares of government, especially when her husband was absent or\r\ndisabled. A pleasant glimpse of her character is gained from a letter\r\nwritten by her to the duke’s treasurer on behalf of a certain Neapolitan\r\nengineer, who had rendered important services but had fallen ill and was\r\nin want. “You will see what this poor man’s needs are. You know with\r\nwhat devotion he has served us, nor are you ignorant who sent him to\r\nus,—a circumstance worthy of consideration. It would ill become us so to\r\ntreat him in his sickness as to give him cause for complaint against us.\r\nYou must know what his pay is. See, then, what can be done, and arrange\r\nfor helping him.” She did not live to witness the downfall of her family\r\nin Naples.\r\n\r\nNote 400 page 205. ISABELLA DEL BALZO, (died 1533), was a daughter of\r\nthe Prince of Altamura, and the wife of Federico III of Naples (see note\r\n401). When her husband lost his crown in 1501, she (together with the\r\nfaithful Sannazaro) accompanied him to France, and shared his exile\r\nthere until his death in 1504. Being, by the terms of a treaty between\r\nLouis XII and Ferdinand the Catholic, compelled to leave France, she and\r\nher four children took refuge, first with her sister Antonia at\r\nGazzuolo, and then at Ferrara, where she was kindly treated and\r\nmaintained by her husband’s nephew Duke Alfonso d’Este. Here she spent\r\nthe last twenty-five years of her life, but at times in such poverty\r\nthat when Julius II placed Ferrara under the ban of the Church, she\r\nobtained special permission to have religious services performed in her\r\nhouse, on the plea that she had not the means wherewith to leave the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nNote 401 page 205. FEDERICO III, (born 1452; died 1504), was a son of\r\nFerdinand I of Naples, a younger brother of Alfonso II, and an uncle of\r\nhis immediate predecessor, Ferdinand II. Having taken part in the weak\r\nresistance offered to Charles VIII’s invasion of Naples in 1494, he\r\nbecame king on the early death of his nephew in October 1496, and seems\r\nto have tried to keep aloof from the turbulent schemes in which\r\nAlexander VI sought to involve him. After another vain attempt to\r\nwithstand the invasion of Louis XII, and having been shamefully betrayed\r\nby the Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand the Catholic, to both of whom he\r\nhad appealed for aid, he retired with his wife and children to the\r\nisland of Ischia (which furnished refuge at the same time to his widowed\r\nsister Beatrice, ex-Queen of Hungary, and to his widowed niece Isabella,\r\nex-Duchess of Milan), ceded his crown to Louis XII in exchange for\r\n30,000 ducats and the Countship of Maine, and spent the last three years\r\nof his life in France.\r\n\r\nNote 402 page 205. Federico’s eldest son Ferdinand, DUKE OF CALABRIA,\r\nwas besieged in Taranto during the Franco-Spanish invasion which\r\nresulted in his father’s downfall. On a sworn promise to set him free,\r\nhe surrendered to the Great Captain (see note 239), but was\r\ntreacherously detained and sent as a prisoner to Spain, where he was\r\ntreated by Ferdinand the Catholic with almost royal honours. He\r\ncontinued to reside in Spain, and on the death of his mother in 1533, he\r\nwas joined at Valencia by his two sisters.\r\n\r\nNote 403 page 205. The reference here is probably to the siege of Pisa\r\nby the Florentines in 1499, which was finally abandoned owing in part at\r\nleast to the bravery of the Pisan women. Castiglione himself was the\r\nauthor of some Latin verses celebrating an incident of the siege.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEDERICO III OF NAPLES\r\n  1452-1504\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a cast, courteously furnished by Professor I.

TOMYRIS was in fact queen of the Massagetæ, who were\r\na nomadic people allied to the Scythians and dwelt north-east of the\r\nCaspian Sea. Herodotus relates that Cyrus the Great sent her an offer of\r\nmarriage, and on being refused, invaded her kingdom and captured her\r\nson, but was finally defeated and slain, 529 B.C. The ARTEMISIA referred\r\nto in the text is probably not the Queen of Halicarnassus (who fought on\r\nthe Persian side at Salamis in 480 B.C.), but rather the sister-consort\r\nand successor of King Mausolus of Caria, a state on the western coast of\r\nAsia Minor. On her husband’s death in 352 B.C., she reigned two years\r\nuntil she pined away for grief. The monument, Mausoleum, erected by her\r\nto his memory at Halicarnassus, was regarded as one of the seven wonders\r\nof the world—the others being: the Egyptian pyramids, the temple of\r\nArtemis at Ephesus, the walls and hanging gardens of Babylon, Phidias’s\r\nstatue of Zeus at Olympia, the Colossus at Rhodes, and the lighthouse at\r\nAlexandria. ZENOBIA, an Arab by birth, was the second wife of Odenathus,\r\nKing of Palmyra, which lay to the east of Syria. On the death of her\r\nhusband, about 266 A.D., she acted as regent for her sons and seems to\r\nhave shown great talent for war as well as for the arts of wise\r\nadministration; but in her effort to extend her sway over the entire\r\nEast, she was defeated by the Emperor Aurelian, and adorned his triumph\r\nin golden chains at Rome. She was allowed to spend the remainder of her\r\nlife in dignified retirement at Tibur (Tivoli). SEMIRAMIS was the\r\nlegendary daughter of the Syrian goddess Derketo, and with her husband\r\nNinus was regarded as the founder of Nineveh. On his death she assumed\r\nthe government of Assyria, built the city of Babylon and its wonderful\r\ngardens, conquered Egypt, etc. To her the Greeks ascribed nearly\r\neverything marvellous in the East. Her name appears in inscriptions as\r\nthat of the consort of an Assyrian ruler who reigned 811-782 B.C.\r\nCLEOPATRA, (69-30 B.C.), was directly descended in the eighth generation\r\nfrom Ptolemy I, the most noted of Alexander the Great’s generals and the\r\nfounder of the Egyptian dynasty that ended with her life. Her\r\nestablishment as sole ruler, to the exclusion of her two brothers, was\r\ndue to the favour of Julius Cæsar, who is said to have acknowledged the\r\npaternity of her son Cæsarion, ultimately put to death by order of\r\nAugustus. Her love of literature, and the refinement of her luxury, show\r\nher to have been no mere voluptuary.\r\n\r\nNote 405 page 206. SARDANAPALUS,—Assurbanipal, the Asnapper of the Old\r\nTestament,—ruled over Assyria from 668 to 626 B.C., and was the last\r\nmonarch of the empire reputed to have been founded by Ninus and\r\nSemiramis. His name became a by-word for effeminate luxury, but in\r\nrecent times the discovery and study of the larger part of the tablets\r\ncomposing his library, prove him to have been a vigorous king and an\r\nintelligent patron of art and literature.\r\n\r\nNote 406 page 207. In his life of Alexander, Plutarch extols the\r\nmagnanimity with which the youthful monarch treated the captive mother,\r\nwife and two daughters, of Darius, the last King of Persia, whom he had\r\nutterly defeated in the battle of Arbela, 331 B.C. In furtherance of his\r\nplan of uniting his European and Asiatic subjects into one people,\r\nAlexander afterwards married Bersine, the elder of Darius’s two\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nNote 407 page 208. This incident is narrated in Valerius Maximus’s\r\n“Memorable Sayings and Doings” as having occurred in the first Spanish\r\ncampaign of Scipio Africanus Maximus, 210 B.C., when that commander was\r\nin his twenty-fourth year.\r\n\r\nNote 408 page 208. This story of the Platonist philosopher Xenocrates\r\n(396-314 B.C.) is derived from the same source last cited. His teaching\r\nwas characterized by the loftiest morality, and included a declaration\r\nthat it comes to the same thing whether we cast longing eyes, or set our\r\nfeet, upon the property of others. The ‘very beautiful woman’ of the\r\ntext is variously mentioned as Phryne and Laïs, rival _hetairai_ said to\r\nhave served as models to the painter Apelles.\r\n\r\nNote 409 page 208. Cicero’s version of this anecdote (_De Officiis_, i,\r\n40) mentions Sophocles as the ‘someone’ rebuked by Pericles.\r\n\r\nNote 410 page 210. The Italians still say:\r\n\r\n                         _Donna pregata, nega;\r\n                         E disprezzata, prega._\r\n\r\nNote 411 page 213. The present translator prefers not to offer an\r\nEnglish version of the following passage, but to reprint it, line for\r\nline, from the Aldine folio of 1528:\r\n\r\n               si che questo piu tosto un stratogema militare dir si\r\nporia, che pura continentia: auenga anchora che la fama di questo non\r\nsia molto sincera: perche alcuni scrittori d’authorità affermano questa\r\ngiouane esser stata da Scipione goduta in amorose delicie: ma di quello\r\nche ui dico io, dubbio alcuno non è.

Gustave Dreyfus, of an\r\n    anonymous bas-relief in his collection at Paris. The sculptor may\r\n    possibly have been Sperandio di Bartolommeo de’ Savelli\r\n    (1425?-1500?). See note 399.\r\n\r\nNote 412 page 214. The event occurred in 1501, six years before the date\r\nof the Courtier dialogues.\r\n\r\nNote 413 page 214. The Volturno flows through Capua.\r\n\r\nNote 414 page 214. Gazuolo or Gazzuolo is now the name of an Italian\r\ncommune, containing less than 5,000 inhabitants, and situated eleven\r\nmiles west of Mantua.\r\n\r\nNote 415 page 214. The Oglio is a river of Lombardy about 135 miles\r\nlong; it traverses the Lake of Iseo, and joins the Po some ten miles\r\nsouth-west of Mantua.\r\n\r\nNote 416 page 214. In two earlier MS. versions of THE COURTIER, the\r\npassage ‘Now from this ... even her name is unknown’ reads: “Then messer\r\nPietro Bembo said: ‘In truth, if I knew this noble peasant girl’s name,\r\nI would compose an epitaph for her.’ ‘Do not stop for that,’ said messer\r\nCesare; ‘her name is Maddalena Biga, and if the Bishop’s death had not\r\noccurred, that bank of the Oglio’” etc.\r\n\r\nWith slight variations this story is narrated as fact in a letter of\r\nMatteo Bandello (1480-1562), from whose tales Shakspere took plots for\r\nhis plays. The letter gives the poor girl’s name as Giulia and that of\r\nthe Bishop of Mantua as Ludovico Gonzaga, and relates that, as it was\r\nunlawful to bury her remains in consecrated soil, he caused them to be\r\ndeposited in the piazza, intending to place them in a bronze sarcophagus\r\nmounted on a marble column. The letter also affirms that the ravisher\r\nwas one of the bishop’s valets.\r\n\r\nNote 417 page 215. This was Ludovico Gonzaga, (born 1458; died 1511), a\r\nson of the Marquess Ludovico of Mantua and Barbara of Brandenburg, and a\r\nyounger brother of “my lady Duchess’s” father. Made BISHOP OF MANTUA in\r\n1483, he continued to hold that office until his death, and appears from\r\nvarious contemporary documents to have been a liberal and wise prince.\r\nThe last years of his life were spent at Gazzuolo, which he made a\r\ncentre of culture, art and learning. His brother Gianfrancesco was\r\nhusband of the Antonia del Balzo mentioned above, note 400. For\r\nparticulars regarding him, see an article by Rossi in the _Giornale\r\nStorico della Letteratura Italiana_, xiii, 305.\r\n\r\nNote 418 page 215. The basilica of St. Sebastian, on the Appian Way,\r\ndates from the 4th century, was built over the most famous of the\r\ncatacombs, and enjoyed an exceptional veneration during the Middle Ages.\r\nThe saint was a young military tribune born in Gaul, suffered martyrdom\r\nunder Diocletian about the year 288, and was buried in the catacombs of\r\nCallistus. St. George and he were the favourite saints of chivalry, and\r\nmay be regarded as the martial Castor and Pollux of Christian myth.\r\n\r\nNote 419 page 216. FELICE DELLA ROVERE, (died about 1536), was a natural\r\ndaughter of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (afterwards Julius II) and a\r\ncertain Lucrezia, the wife of Bernardo de Cuppis (or Coppi) da\r\nMontefolco; thus “my lord Prefect” of THE COURTIER was her own cousin.\r\nIn 1506 she became the second wife of the elderly and eccentric\r\nGiangiordano Orsini, and the ancestress of the Dukes of Bracciano. Her\r\nname often occurs in contemporary documents, not only on account of her\r\nlofty position but because of her love of art and letters. Both\r\nCastiglione and Giancristoforo Romano were her friends. The incident\r\nmentioned in the text seems not to be referred to elsewhere. Savona, a\r\nseaport on the western Riviera, is near the birthplace of Felice’s\r\ngreat-uncle, Pope Sixtus IV, who was the founder of the della Rovere\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nNote 420 page 216. Duke Guidobaldo’s impotence is said to have given\r\nrise to the project of a divorce for his duchess.\r\n\r\nNote 421 page 218. The reference here is to Ovid’s _Ars Amandi_, which\r\nenjoyed an extraordinary reputation during the Renaissance, and from\r\nwhich this passage is largely derived.\r\n\r\nNote 422 page 220. The LAURA to whom Petrarch consecrated no less than\r\nthree hundred and eighteen sonnets, is usually regarded as identical\r\nwith Laure, the daughter of a certain knight of Avignon, Audibert de\r\nNoves. If this identification be correct, she was born in 1308, married\r\nHughes de Sade in 1325, became the mother of eleven children, and died\r\nin 1348. In 1533 Francis I caused her reputed tomb to be opened, and\r\nfound in it a small box which contained a medal bearing a woman’s\r\nprofile, and a parchment on which was a sonnet signed by Petrarch.\r\n\r\nNote 423 page 220. The so-called “Song of Solomon” is now thought to be\r\nthe work of a period later than Solomon’s and to contain no mystic\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nNote 424 page 222. In the old romance, “Amadis of Gaul,” Isola Ferma is\r\nan enchanted island, with a garden at the entrance to which stands an\r\narch surmounted by the statue of a man holding a trumpet to his mouth.\r\nWhenever an unfaithful lover attempts to pass, the trumpet emits a\r\ndreadful sound with fire and smoke, and drives the culprit back; while\r\nit welcomes all true lovers with sweetest music.\r\n\r\nNote 425 page 228. Here again the reference is of course to “my lady\r\nDuchess.”\r\n\r\nNote 426 page 235. The _Hypnerotomachia Poliphili_, first published by\r\nAldus in 1499, was written by Francesco Colonna, a Dominican friar of\r\nVenice, who died an old man in 1527. The book is rare, and is said to be\r\nan allegorical romance full of lascivious erudition, and written in a\r\npedantically affected mixture of Italian, Latin, and Venetian _patois_.\r\n\r\nNote 427 page 237. _Ars Amandi_, i, 597-602.\r\n\r\nNote 428 page 237. _Ars Amandi_, i, 569-72.\r\n\r\n\r\n                NOTES TO THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE COURTIER\r\n\r\nNote 429 page 243. Gaspar Pallavicino died in 1511, at the age of\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nNote 430 page 243. Cesare Gonzaga died in 1512, at about the age of\r\nthirty-seven. See note 43.\r\n\r\nNote 431 page 244. Federico Fregoso was named Archbishop of Salerno in\r\n1507, very soon after the date of the Courtier dialogues; see note 41.\r\n\r\nLudovico da Canossa became Bishop of Bayeux in 1520; see note 44.\r\n\r\nOttaviano Fregoso became Doge of Genoa in 1513; see note 11.\r\n\r\nBibbiena was made cardinal, and Bembo was appointed papal secretary, in\r\n1513; see notes 10 and 42.\r\n\r\nGiuliano de’ Medici was created Duke of Nemours in 1515. As he died in\r\n1516, Castiglione’s use of the present tense (‘that greatness where now\r\nhe is’) is inconsistent with the mention of Canossa as Bishop of Bayeux.\r\nSee note 9.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria della Rovere succeeded to the dukedom in 1508; see note\r\n3.\r\n\r\nNote 432 page 244. ELEANORA GONZAGA, (born about 1492; died 1543), was\r\nthe eldest daughter of the Marquess Gianfrancesco of Mantua and Isabella\r\nd’Este. In 1505 Castiglione negotiated her union with Francesco Maria\r\ndella Rovere, but the marriage did not take place until Christmas Eve\r\n1509, upon which occasion Bembo wrote to Federico Fregoso that he had\r\nnever seen a comelier, merrier or sweeter girl, and that her amiable\r\ndisposition and surprisingly precocious judgment won general admiration.\r\nShe seems to have maintained affectionate relations with her aunt and\r\npredecessor (“my lady Duchess” of THE COURTIER), whose fame quite\r\noutshone her own, and to have exhibited in after life no little strength\r\nof character. She is said to have excluded, and even to have expelled,\r\ngreat ladies of questionable morality from her court. Titian’s portrait\r\n(1537) represents her in middle age, but his pictures, _La Bella_ and\r\n_Das Mädchen im Pelz_, as well as several of his Venus heads, are\r\ngenerally regarded as idealized presentations of her more youthful face.\r\n\r\nNote 433 page 249. The Piazza d’Agone occupied the site of the ancient\r\n_Circus Agonalis_, which derived its name from the _Agonalia_, a\r\nfestival held twice a year in honour of Janus. Before, during and long\r\nafter Castiglione’s time, it was a centre of festivals, amusements and\r\nspectacles at the carnival season. It is now called the Piazza Navona.\r\n\r\nNote 434 page 250. The famous Athenian commander CIMON, (died 449 B.C.),\r\nwas the son of the still more famous Miltiades. His victories repulsed\r\nthe last Persian aggressions and consolidated the Athenian supremacy.\r\nAlthough an admirer of Spartan institutions, he seems to have been of a\r\nsomewhat indulgent disposition. The SCIPIO here referred to, is probably\r\nPublius Cornelius Scipio the Elder, who was the victor over Hannibal and\r\ndied 183 B.C. LUCULLUS is cited earlier in THE COURTIER as an instance\r\nof a soldier with studious tastes; see note 113.\r\n\r\nNote 435 page 250. The Theban general and statesman EPAMINONDAS, (died\r\n362 B.C.), is said by Plutarch to have enjoyed the instruction of the\r\nPythagorean philosopher LYSIS of Tarentum, who was driven out of Italy\r\nin the persecution of his sect, and found refuge at Thebes.\r\n\r\nNote 436 page 250. AGESILAUS was King of Sparta 398-361 B.C. Although\r\nsmall and lame, he was the greatest Spartan commander, and became famous\r\nfor his victories against the Persian and Greek enemies of his country.\r\nXENOPHON, historian, essayist and disciple of Socrates, was banished\r\nfrom Athens about the time of Socrates’s death (399 B.C.), accompanied\r\nAgesilaus into Asia, and wrote a panegyric upon him, regarded by Cicero\r\nas more glorious than all the statues erected to kings.\r\n\r\nThe reverence and love of SCIPIO THE YOUNGER (about 185-129 B.C.) for\r\nthe Rhodian Stoic philosopher PANAÆTIUS (about 180-111 B.C.) is\r\nfrequently mentioned by Cicero, from whose _De Oratore_ Castiglione\r\nseems to have taken this whole passage.\r\n\r\nNote 437 page 252. In Greek mythology Epimetheus (Afterthought) and\r\nPrometheus (Forethought) were sons of the Titan Iapetus and the ocean\r\nnymph Clymene. Angered by a deceit practised upon him by Prometheus,\r\nZeus withheld from men the use of fire; but Prometheus stole fire from\r\nheaven and brought it to earth in a hollow reed. For this offence he was\r\nchained to a rock where an eagle preyed daily upon his liver (which grew\r\nagain in the night), until he was finally liberated by Hercules. As\r\ncompensation for the boon of fire, Zeus sent Pandora (the first woman,\r\nendowed with beauty, cunning and other attributes designed to bring woe\r\nto man) to be the wife of Epimetheus. Although warned by his brother,\r\nEpimetheus accepted her, with the result that she set free the evils\r\nwhich Prometheus had concealed in a box. In a later form of the legend,\r\nshe received from the gods a box containing the blessings of life, and\r\non her being moved by curiosity to open the box, all of them (save hope)\r\nescaped and were lost.\r\n\r\nNote 438 page 263. BIAS was born at Priene in Asia Minor, and lived in\r\nthe 6th century B.C. He was celebrated for his apothegms and reckoned\r\namong the Seven Sages of Greece,—the other six being: Thales of Miletus,\r\nSolon of Athens, Chilon of Sparta, Cleobulus of Rhodes, Periander of\r\nCorinth, and Pittacus of Mitylene,—all of whom flourished about 600 B.C.\r\nThe fame of these seven men rested not upon their philosophy, as we use\r\nthe word, but upon their practical wisdom—the fruit of experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GIANFRANCESCO GONZAGA\r\n  MARQUESS OF MANTUA\r\n  BROTHER OF “MY LADY DUCHESS”\r\n  1466-1519\r\n]\r\n\r\nEnlarged from a photograph, kindly furnished by Signer Alessandro Luzio\r\n    and made by his friend Signor Lanzoni, of a portrait attributed to\r\n    Francesco Bonsignori (1455-1519) and owned by the antiquary\r\n    Bressanelli of Mantua.\r\n\r\nNote 439 page 264. CLEARCHUS, (died 353 B.C.), was for twelve years a\r\ncruel tyrant, not of Pontus, but of Heraclea (the modern Eregli), a city\r\non the Black Sea about 140 miles east of Constantinople. He is said to\r\nhave been a pupil of both Plato and Isocrates, the latter of whom\r\nrepresents him as a gentle youth.\r\n\r\nNote 440 page 264. Of the dozen or more ancients known to have borne the\r\nname ARISTODEMUS, none seem to fit precisely the description given in\r\nthe text, which is taken from a passage in Plutarch’s “On the Ignorant\r\nPrince.” Plutarch may have had in mind a certain tyrant of Megalopolis\r\nin the 3d century B.C.\r\n\r\nNote 441 page 269. The reference here is to Book V of “The Republic.”\r\n\r\nNote 442 page 270. Fregoso here declares for what has been called “that\r\nUtopia of the 16th Century—the _Governo Misto_—a political invention\r\nwhich fascinated the imagination of Italian statesmen much in the same\r\nway as the theory of perpetual motion attracted scientific minds in the\r\nlast century.” (Symonds’s “Renaissance in Italy,” i, 306.) In this\r\nregard the men of Castiglione’s time, men like Machiavelli and\r\nGuicciardini, were only following Plato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nNote 443 page 270. The reference here is to the _Cyropædia_, i, 6.\r\n\r\nNote 444 page 270. Castiglione seems to have in mind the game of _tavola\r\nreale_, which is similar to our backgammon.\r\n\r\nNote 445 page 273. Circe’s transformation of some of Ulysses’s\r\ncompanions into swine is narrated in the tenth book of the Odyssey. In\r\nCastiglione’s day the term “King of France” was used to signify the acme\r\nof royal power.\r\n\r\nNote 446 page 274. GIANFRANCESCO—more commonly called FRANCESCO—GONZAGA,\r\n(born 1466; died 1519), was the eldest son of the Marquess Federico of\r\nMantua and Margarita of Bavaria, and a brother of “my lady Duchess.”\r\nHaving succeeded his father in 1484, he married (1490) Isabella d’Este,\r\nto whom he had been betrothed at the age of sixteen. Like his ancestors\r\nand most other petty Italian rulers of his time, he was at once\r\n_condottiere_ and sovereign prince. He commanded the Italian troops\r\nagainst Charles VIII, and although with an overwhelmingly superior force\r\nhe failed to block the retreat of the French at Fornovo, he treated that\r\ndisgraceful affair as a glorious victory, and even caused it to be\r\ncommemorated by Mantegna in a votive picture now in the Louvre. He\r\nserved successively as captain of the imperial troops in Italy, as\r\ncommander of Duke Ludovico Sforza’s army, as viceroy of Naples under\r\nLouis XII, etc. He joined the League of Cambray and was taken prisoner\r\nby the Venetians. In the general disorders that filled the period of his\r\nreign, he and his more brilliant wife had the address to protect his\r\ndominions from the ravages of war. Although, as Castiglione’s natural\r\nlord, he was asked and gave his consent to the latter’s entry into the\r\nDuke of Urbino’s court (1504), he seems to have continued to resent the\r\naffair until Castiglione’s return (1516) to his service,—in which the\r\nauthor remained when this part of the text was written. Castiglione’s\r\neulogy was far from undeserved, for to the Marquess’s munificence, no\r\nless than to his consort’s taste and enthusiasm, must be ascribed the\r\nlustre of their provincial court. Besides being a patron of art and\r\nletters, he was also a successful breeder of horses for use both in war\r\nand in racing.\r\n\r\nNote 447 page 274. The duke is said to have had no small share in\r\nplanning the palace; his chief architect was one Luciano, a native of\r\nLaurana in Dalmatia on the eastern coast of the Adriatic. The cost of\r\nthe structure was about £400,000 sterling. See, besides the authorities\r\ncited in note 28, Luzio and Renier’s _Mantova e Urbino_, (Roux: Turin:\r\n1893), p. 10, note 1.\r\n\r\nNote 448 page 274. The ancient basilica of St. Peter’s had become\r\nruinous by 1450, but little was done towards rebuilding it until 1506,\r\nwhen the execution of Bramante’s plan was begun with the solemn laying\r\nof the first stone by Julius II on Sunday, 18 April. On the death of\r\nBramante, Raphael was put in charge of the work in 1514, as we have seen\r\n(note 98), but, apparently owing to lack of funds, progress was slow\r\nuntil 1534 when Michelangelo’s designs were substituted. The dome was\r\ncompleted in 1590, and the church dedicated in 1626.\r\n\r\nNote 449 page 274. This ‘street’ was designed by Bramante to be a kind\r\nof triumphal way connecting the Vatican with the Belvedere pavilion. It\r\nwas to be bordered by palaces, courts, gardens, porticoes, terraces,\r\netc., but the death of Julius II led to the abandonment of the plan.\r\n\r\nNote 450 page 274. Pozzuoli (the ancient Puteoli), situated seven miles\r\nwest of Naples, was originally a Greek city, but became one of the chief\r\ncommercial ports of the Roman Empire, and a resort of the patrician\r\nclass. It is noted for its ruins, especially those of a large\r\namphitheatre.\r\n\r\nBaja (the ancient Baiæ), on the Gulf of Pozzuoli, was the chief Roman\r\nwatering place, famous for its luxury, and containing the villas of many\r\ncelebrated Romans. Its principal antiquities are ruins of baths.\r\n\r\nCivita Vecchia lies on the coast about thirty-eight miles north-west of\r\nRome, and was anciently known as Centum Cellæ. The Emperor Trajan\r\n(reigned 98-117 A.D.) converted it from a poor village into a great\r\nseaport, and of his monuments some remains are still extant.\r\n\r\nPorto was a Roman city near the mouths of the Tiber. In Castiglione’s\r\ntime it had become a marshy island. One of the earliest Italian\r\narchæologists, Flavio Biondo, visited the site in 1451, and found there\r\nmany huge marble blocks ready for building and bearing quarry marks of\r\nthe imperial period. The Apollo Belvedere was discovered here in 1503.\r\n\r\nNote 451 page 274. Almost the same phrase occurs in the well known\r\nletter which Raphael (who had been appointed guardian of antiquities)\r\nwrote to Leo X, urging the pontiff to avert the complete destruction of\r\n“that little which remains of Italian glory and greatness in proof of\r\nthe worth and power of those divine minds.” Castiglione was long\r\nsupposed to be the author of the letter, but is now believed only to\r\nhave aided Raphael in its composition.\r\n\r\nNote 452 page 274. Alexandria was founded by the conqueror in 332 B.C.\r\n\r\nBucephalia (founded 327 B.C.) was situated on the river Hydaspes (the\r\nmodern Jhelum), a branch of the Indus, about 120 miles north-west of\r\nLahore, and was named in honour of Alexander’s favourite horse, which\r\ndied there. Bucephalus (ox-headed) is supposed to have been a name given\r\nto Thessalian horses, which were branded with a bull’s head.\r\n\r\nNote 453 page 274. Mount Athos (6780 feet high) forms the extremity of\r\nthe easternmost peninsula of Chalcidice in Macedonia. During the Persian\r\ninvasion of Xerxes (480 B.C.) it was temporarily converted into an\r\nisland, and since the Middle Ages has been noted for its monasteries.\r\nBoth Vitruvius and Plutarch give an account of the project mentioned in\r\nthe text, and ascribe it to a Macedonian architect who appears under the\r\nnames, Dinocrates, Cheirocrates, and Stasicrates,—and who also planned\r\nthe city of Alexandria and was chosen to rebuild the great temple of\r\nArtemis at Ephesus. The statue was to represent Alexander, who is said\r\nto have abandoned the idea when he learned that the city to be placed in\r\nthe hand of the statue would be without territory and could be\r\nprovisioned only by sea,—saying that such a city would be like a child\r\nthat cannot grow for failure of its nurse’s milk.\r\n\r\nNote 454 page 275. In Athenian legend PROCRUSTES was a cruel robber, who\r\nhad a bed upon which he tortured his captives by stretching those who\r\nwere too short and by cutting off the legs of those who were too long.\r\nHe was finally slain by the hero Theseus.\r\n\r\nSCIRON was another legendary Attic robber, who compelled his victims to\r\nwash his feet on the Scironian rocks near Athens, and then kicked them\r\ninto the sea where they served to fatten the turtles upon which he fed.\r\nHe also was slain by Theseus, and in the same manner in which he had\r\nslain others.\r\n\r\nIn Roman myth CACUS was a gigantic son of Vulcan, living near the site\r\nof Rome. He robbed Hercules of some of the cattle stolen from the\r\nmonster Geryon, and dragged them into his cave backwards, so that they\r\ncould not be tracked; but Hercules discovered them by their lowing, and\r\nslew the thief.\r\n\r\nDIOMED (not the Argive prince of the Iliad, but Ares’s mythical son, who\r\nwas king over the Bistones in Thrace) was slain by Hercules because he\r\nwas accustomed to feed his mares on human flesh.\r\n\r\nANTÆUS was a fabulous and gigantic wrestler of Libya, reputed to be the\r\nson of Poseidon and Gæa, the Earth goddess. Being held aloft and thus\r\ndeprived of the miraculous strength derived from contact with his mother\r\nearth, he was crushed to death by Hercules. GERYON was the mythical\r\nthree-headed king of Hesperia, the theft of whose cattle constituted the\r\ntenth of the Twelve Labours of Hercules.\r\n\r\nNote 455 page 275. “The crimes of the tyrants against their subjects and\r\nthe members of their own families had produced a correlative order of\r\ncrime in the people over whom they tyrannized. Cruelty was met by\r\nconspiracy. Tyrannicide became honourable; and the proverb, ‘He who\r\ngives his own life can take a tyrant’s,’ had worked itself into the\r\npopular language.” (Symonds’s “Renaissance in Italy,” i, 154.) “The\r\nstudy of the classics, especially of Plutarch, at this time as also\r\nduring the French Revolution, fired the imagination of patriots.” (Id.,\r\n151, note 2.)\r\n\r\nNote 456 page 275. Similar exhortations to a fresh crusade are of\r\nfrequent occurrence in Italian literature of this period, and were often\r\nused by popes and princes as a cover for their selfish designs.\r\n\r\nNote 457 page 275. The meaning obviously is that if they had not been\r\nexiled, they never would have enjoyed their present prosperity. Plutarch\r\ntells the story in four slightly varying forms.\r\n\r\nNote 458 page 276. MONSEIGNEUR D’ANGOULÊME afterwards became Francis I\r\n(see note 111). Even stronger evidence of the author’s admiration than\r\nthis and another passage (see page 57), is afforded by the Proem with\r\nwhich he originally intended to preface the dialogues, but for which he\r\nseems to have been led by political considerations to substitute the\r\nintroduction finally printed.\r\n\r\nNote 459 page 276. HENRY, PRINCE OF WALES, afterwards Henry VIII, (born\r\n1491; died 1547), was the younger son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of\r\nYork, and was educated for the church. Having succeeded his father in\r\n1509, he married (in accordance with his parents’ wish) his elder\r\nbrother Arthur’s widow, Catherine, the youngest child of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella the Catholic. His accession was hailed with enthusiasm. Left\r\nrich through his father’s avarice, he was generous, frank, handsome,\r\nexceptionally robust, and an accomplished athlete and scholar. Good men\r\nwere delighted with the purity of his life, his gaiety pleased the\r\ncourtiers, and sober statesmen found in him a singular capacity for\r\nbusiness. Besides being a musician, he spoke Latin, French and Spanish,\r\nand was very devout,—usually attending mass five times daily. Even as\r\nlate as 1521 he dedicated to the pope an anti-Lutheran tract on the\r\nSeven Sacraments, and in return received the title of Defender of the\r\nFaith. As an offset to the enormities of his later life, it is only just\r\nto remember that he raised England to the rank of a great European\r\npower, and that for twenty years he did nothing to mar the harmony of\r\nhis reign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HENRY VII OF ENGLAND\r\n  1457-1509\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Walker and Boutall’s photograph of an anonymous portrait\r\n    (no. 416) in the National Portrait Gallery at London. Painted on an\r\n    oak panel for one Herman Rinck in October 1505, the picture was once\r\n    owned by M. Julien at Le Mans, by M. Émile Barre at Paris, and by\r\n    Mr. E. J. Muller, from whom it was acquired by the Gallery in 1876.\r\n\r\nNote 460 page 276. ‘His great father,’ i.e., Henry VII, (born 1457; died\r\n1509), was the son of Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, (a son of Henry\r\nV’s widow Catherine), and Margaret Beaufort, whose paternal grandfather\r\nwas an illegitimate half-brother of Henry IV. After the downfall of the\r\nHouse of Lancaster and the death of the young York princes, Henry\r\nsucceeded in gathering a strong party, landed in England and wrested the\r\ncrown from Richard III, 1485. Soon afterwards, by his marriage to Edward\r\nIV’s daughter Elizabeth of York, he united the hostile factions that had\r\nso long harassed the kingdom. As a ruler he was avaricious, calculating,\r\nand far from popular. He is said to have left a treasure of £2,000,000\r\nsterling. The marriage of his daughter Margaret to James IV of Scotland\r\nfinally led (on the failure of his son’s issue) to the accession of the\r\nStuarts in the person of her grandson, James I.\r\n\r\nNote 461 page 276. This is consistent with the earlier passage (see page\r\n8) where Castiglione pretends to have been absent in England at the date\r\nof the Courtier dialogues. An earlier MS. version here reads: “as we are\r\ntold by our friend Castiglione, who has just returned from England,”\r\nwhich accords with what we have seen (note 23) to be the fact.\r\n\r\nNote 462 page 276. DON CARLOS, afterwards the Emperor Charles V, (born\r\n1500; died 1558), was the son of the Emperor Maximilian’s son Philip of\r\nAustria, and of Juana, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic.\r\nBorn and bred in the Low Countries, and educated at least partly under\r\nthe care of the future pope Adrian VI, he is said to have shown less\r\ntaste for study than for military exercises, and on his accession to the\r\nSpanish throne in 1516, he was ignorant of the Spanish language. By\r\nright of his grandmother Mary of Burgundy, he already held the\r\nNetherlands. As representative of the house of Aragon, he was king of\r\nNaples and Sicily. On the death of his grandfather Maximilian in 1519,\r\nhe inherited Austria, and (in spite of the rivalry of Francis I and the\r\nintrigues of Leo X) was elected Emperor;—thus achieving, without a blow,\r\na dominion vaster than any in Europe since the time of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier MS. version the text here reads: “Then messer Bernardo\r\nBibbiena said: ‘I do not think that any of those present, except myself,\r\nhave seen the prince Don Carlos, who, having recently lost such a father\r\nas the king Don Philip was, has shown such courage and wisdom in this\r\ngreat bereavement, that although he has not reached the tenth year of\r\nhis age, we may nevertheless regard him as competent to rule over all\r\nhis hereditary possessions, vast though they be,—and that the Empire of\r\nChristendom (which men think will be in his hands) must grow not a\r\nlittle in power and dignity.’”\r\n\r\nNote 463 page 279. FEDERICO GONZAGA, the first Duke of Mantua, (born\r\n1500; died 1540), was the son of the Marquess Gianfrancesco Gonzaga and\r\nIsabella d’Este. At the age of ten he spent some time as the\r\nhostage-guest of Julius II at Rome, where he seems to have been\r\ngenerally caressed. Raphael is known to have introduced the boy’s face\r\ninto one of the Vatican frescoes, and a little later to have painted his\r\nportrait. Having succeeded his father as marquess in 1519, he waged war\r\nfor Leo X against the French. In 1527 he joined the league of Italian\r\nprinces against Charles V, but went over to the Emperor’s side two years\r\nlater, and was created Duke of Mantua. In 1531 he married Margarita\r\nPaleologus. Both Giulio Romano and Benvenuto Cellini were in his employ.\r\n\r\nNote 464 page 280. These lines were written after Ottaviano Fregoso’s\r\nelection as Doge of Genoa; see note 11.\r\n\r\nNote 465 page 281. In an earlier MS. version, my lady Emilia continues:\r\n“‘And even if it were so, I do not see how he is on that account set\r\nabove the Court Lady.’ The Magnifico Giuliano said: ‘We regard the Lady\r\nas the equal of the Courtier, and according to my lord Ottaviano, the\r\nCourtier is superior to the Prince; therefore the Court Lady comes to be\r\nsuperior to the Prince.’”\r\n\r\nNote 466 page 284. Phœnix appears in the Iliad as appointed by Peleus to\r\nsuperintend the education of the latter’s son Achilles.\r\n\r\nNote 467 page 284. ARISTOTLE was summoned (342 B.C.) to undertake the\r\neducation of Alexander, who was then thirteen years old, and whom no one\r\nhad thus far been able to control. The philosopher’s training continued\r\nuninterruptedly for four years, included instruction in poetry,\r\nrhetoric, philosophy, physics, and medicine,—and is said to have had\r\nbeneficial effect upon the future conqueror’s character.\r\n\r\nNote 468 page 285. Stagira lay on the easterly side of the Chalcidic\r\npeninsula. Philip had destroyed it in his Olynthian campaign of 348\r\nB.C., but rebuilt it at Aristotle’s request and caused a gymnasium to be\r\nerected there, in a shady grove, for the use of the philosopher and his\r\npupils, among whom was Alexander.\r\n\r\nNote 469 page 285. Plutarch expressly affirms that Alexander’s policy,\r\nof uniting all the nations under his sway into a single people, was not\r\nfounded on Aristotle’s advice, as indeed an examination of the latter’s\r\npolitical theories would seem to prove.\r\n\r\nNote 470 page 285. The Bactrians were an Aryan people dwelling on the\r\nupper Oxus, in what is now Afghanistan. They were conquered in 327 B.C.\r\nby Alexander, who married Roxana, the daughter of one of their princes.\r\nIn ancient times the inhabitants of northern and eastern Europe and Asia\r\nwere called Scythians.\r\n\r\nNote 471 page 285. CALLISTHENES was a cousin and fellow pupil of\r\nAlexander’s. On Aristotle’s recommendation, Alexander took Callisthenes\r\nwith him on his Asiatic expedition of 334 B.C., but, exasperated by his\r\nyoung kinsman’s plain-spoken disapproval of his conduct, had\r\nCallisthenes put to death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DON CARLOS\r\n  PRINCE OF SPAIN\r\n  1500-1558\r\n]\r\n\r\nReduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 43.099) of the portrait, in the\r\n    Borghese collection at Rome, attributed to Bernhard Strigel\r\n    (1460?-1528).\r\n\r\nNote 472 page 285. DIO, (born about 408; died about 354 B.C.), was an\r\naustere Syracusan philosopher who became an ardent disciple of Plato on\r\nthe occasion of the latter’s short residence at the court of Dionysius\r\nthe Elder, and later induced the younger DIONYSIUS also to invite Plato\r\nto Syracuse, where, however, the philosopher was unable long to check\r\nthe tyrant’s profligacy.\r\n\r\nNote 473 page 287. Bembo was thirty-six years old at the date of the\r\nCourtier dialogues.\r\n\r\nNote 474 page 288. In Book III of Bembo’s _Gli Asolani_ (1505), a hermit\r\ndiscourses to Lavinello on the beauty of mystical Christian love. Bembo\r\nhad a villa called Lavinello, near Padua.\r\n\r\nNote 475 page 288. Much of the following disquisition seems to be drawn\r\nfrom Plato and from Bembo’s _Gli Asolani_. As Bembo is known to have\r\nrevised THE COURTIER before publication, we may assume that he was\r\ncontent with the form and substance of the discourse here attributed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNote 476 page 294. STESICHORUS was a Greek lyric poet who lived about\r\n630-550 B.C., and was supposed to have been miraculously stricken blind\r\nafter writing an attack upon Helen of Troy. His true name is said to\r\nhave been Tisias, and to have been changed to Stesichorus because he was\r\nthe first to establish a chorus for singing to the harp. Fragments of\r\nhis verse have survived.\r\n\r\nNote 477 page 294. These ‘five other stars’ are of course the five\r\nplanets then known (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn), in\r\naddition to the Sun and Moon, which were until long afterwards regarded\r\nas planets. “The sun, the moon and the five planets were always to be\r\nfound within a region of the sky extending about 8° on each side of the\r\necliptic. This strip of the celestial sphere was called the Zodiac,\r\nbecause the constellations in it were (with one exception) named after\r\nliving things (Greek ζῷον, an animal); it was divided into twelve equal\r\nparts, the Signs of the Zodiac, through one of which the sun passed\r\nevery month, so that the position of the sun at any time could be\r\nroughly described by stating in what ‘sign’ it was.” Arthur Berry’s\r\n“Short History of Astronomy” (London, 1898), p. 13.\r\n\r\nNote 478 page 305. Castiglione here follows that version of the Hercules\r\nmyth which represents the hero, tormented by the poisoned shirt sent him\r\nby the jealous Deianeira, as throwing himself upon a burning pyre on\r\nMount Œta, whence he was caught up to heaven in a cloud.\r\n\r\nNote 479 page 305. Compare: Exodus, iii, 2; Acts, ii, 1-4; and II Kings,\r\nii, 11-2.\r\n\r\nNote 480 page 307. This dialogue is by some represented as having\r\nactually taken place in the presence of Raphael.\r\n\r\nNote 481 page 308. PLOTINUS was born in Egypt about 204 A.D., and taught\r\nphilosophy at Rome. He lived so exclusively the life of speculation that\r\nhe seemed ashamed of bodily existence, and concealed his parentage,\r\nbirthplace and age.\r\n\r\nNote 482 page 308. ST. FRANCIS, (Gianfrancesco Bernardone, 1182-1226),\r\nwas born and died at Assisi near Perugia, and was canonized in 1288.\r\n\r\nNote 483 page 308. II Corinthians, xii, 2-4.\r\n\r\nNote 484 page 308.

Mount Catria lies less than twenty miles to the\r\nsouthward of Urbino, between Pergola and Gubbio, and rises a little more\r\nthan a mile above the sea level.

Since the translator\r\nclaims to reproduce the 1528 Aldine edition \"line for line\", those\r\nbreaks are retained.\r\n\r\n line 9 : e tempo era il [letto],\r\n line 19: che fosse [stato]\r\n line 23: & [graue]: (for modern \"grave\")\r\n line 39: come se fusse stato [all’opiato] (for modern \"oppiato\")\r\n line 40: [Veramente]\r\n line 44: che si [scriue] (for modern \"scrive\")\r\n line 45: gran prezzo per una [notte],\r\n line 46: Rideasi [tutta].\r\n\r\nOther errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected,\r\nand are noted here.
