BREWER\r\n\r\nTHE TORCH PRESS\r\nCEDAR RAPIDS\r\nIOWA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMORY OF OUR\r\nHONORED PIONEERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Linn county is covered by the events of only a few\r\nyears, if compared with the history of communities east of the\r\nMississippi. The space of one life-time embraces all that has happened\r\nhere since the first white man looked upon our goodly heritage. True,\r\nthat life has been prolonged beyond the scriptural three score and ten\r\nyears. Robert Ellis, who came to this community more than seventy years\r\nago, and who was one of the very early settlers, yet lives in a hale\r\nand vigorous age on land he \"claimed\" at that time.\r\n\r\nBut if the history of the county does not cover many years, it yet is a\r\nhistory crowded with happenings of interest, some of the incidents\r\nbeing more or less stirring.\r\n\r\nHistory is defined as a record of the past. It does not concern itself\r\nwith the present. It has been the purpose of the editors of this volume\r\nto treat somewhat at length of the early days in the county. Those\r\nconversant with events occurring prior to the Civil war are rapidly\r\nmoving on, and it is high time that their recollections of beginnings\r\nhere were gathered and put in permanent form.\r\n\r\nThis has been attempted--how imperfectly done no one realizes more\r\nkeenly than we realize it. But like little Mary Wood of the story, we\r\nhave done the best we could in the few months given us to prepare the\r\npages which follow. We have done some things which need not be done\r\nagain by any one who follows us. We have made definite some things in\r\nour history as a county that heretofore have been matters of\r\nuncertainty. It is felt that the present volume will make an excellent\r\nstarting point for some future chronicler.\r\n\r\nThe task of the historian has been an arduous one--far more arduous\r\nthan can be imagined by any save those who have done similar work.\r\nWithal the task has been one of pleasure and of inspiration. The\r\npursuit of knowledge in this instance has really been a delight.\r\n\r\nWe have been taught many things by our work that add to the sum of the\r\npleasures of living in a day crowded with all the conveniences of the\r\ntwentieth century. Our respect for the courageous pioneer men and the\r\nequally courageous and self-sacrificing pioneer women of our county has\r\nbeen placed high. Nobly did they suffer, enduring privations now\r\nundreamed of, and never complaining that theirs was a hard lot. We\r\nstand with uncovered heads and with a reverent feeling in their\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to make due acknowledgments to all those who aided\r\nin gathering the material in this volume. Many who came here in the\r\nearly years of the county have been consulted, and always with profit.\r\nThe drudgery of the work of making this book has been greatly lessened\r\nby their courtesy and their help. We thank them all. Some of them have\r\nbeen credited with their assistance in the narrative itself. In\r\naddition to the names mentioned in the text we desire to give thanks\r\nfor aid and counsel to N. E. Brown, perhaps the best posted man in\r\nCedar Rapids on the early history of the city; to Ed. M. Scott, for\r\nmost valuable aid in the preparation of the chapter on banks and\r\nbanking; to Capt. J. O. Stewart and Col. W. G. Dows for appreciated\r\nassistance in the writing of the chapter on our military history; to\r\nCarle D. Brown, of the Commercial Art Press, who gathered most of the\r\nillustrations for the volume; to W. F. Stahl, for aid in giving the\r\nhistory of the United Brethren church in the county. Robert Ellis, Mrs.\r\nSusan Mekeel, Mrs. Susan Shields, Mrs. Elizabeth Hrdlicka, Augustus\r\nAbbe, J. H. Preston, C. G. Greene, J. S. Ely, Wm. Smyth, C. F. Butler,\r\nL. W. Mansfield, and many others have assisted in gathering much\r\nvaluable material concerning the lives of the pioneers.\r\n\r\nMuch that has been gathered concerning times far removed from the\r\npresent, is from \"hearsay,\" hence it has been difficult to be certain\r\nas to the correct facts in some instances. Inaccuracies may be found,\r\nbut these are due to unavoidable omissions, largely on the part of\r\nthose who have related these happenings and not from any sense of bias\r\nor prejudice.\r\n\r\nAll prior county histories have been consulted as well as the early\r\nstate gazetteers, Andreas' _Atlas_, Carroll's _History_, _History of\r\nCrescent Lodge_, _History of the Bench and Bar of Iowa_, _History of\r\nthe Courts and Legal Profession_, _Proceedings_ of the Linn County\r\nHistorical Society; and the files of the newspapers published in the\r\ncounty in an early day. It is needless to add that the early city\r\ndirectories have been largely used with reference to the business men\r\nof Cedar Rapids in the early days.\r\n\r\nReferences to persons have been confined to mere statements of facts\r\nand have been free from undue flattery on the one hand and from\r\nanything derogatory on the other. The members of the legal and medical\r\nprofessions have been referred to at some length for the reason that\r\nthe lawyers and doctors were important factors in pioneer days, both in\r\nthe organization of the county and in the promotion of the various\r\nenterprises in our towns.\r\n\r\nTrusting that this history may be of some value in preserving material\r\nwhich ere long would pass beyond reach of preservation, this work is\r\nrespectfully dedicated to the early pioneers of the county, whose lives\r\nand careers the authors have attempted to describe in the following\r\npages.\r\n\r\n                                                 LUTHER A.

Prairie is a French word and\r\nsignifies meadow. It was the name first applied to the great treeless\r\nplains of North America by the French missionaries who were the first\r\nwhite men to explore these regions.\r\n\r\nAs yet scientists have not been able to explain the origin of the\r\nprairies. Different theories have been advanced, but the interesting\r\nproblem is without satisfactory and conclusive solution.\r\n\r\nAgassiz, the scientist, maintained that America is not the \"new world.\"\r\n\"Hers was the first dry land lifted out of the waters,\" he wrote; \"hers\r\nthe first shores washed by the ocean that enveloped all the earth\r\nbesides; and while Europe was represented only by islands rising here\r\nand there above the sea, America already stretched one unbroken line of\r\nland from Nova Scotia to the far West.\"\r\n\r\nIowa, also, was born, had a beginning sometime. Just how many years ago\r\nthis interesting event took place it is difficult to approximate. Prof.\r\nSamuel Calvin, state geologist, says that \"geological records,\r\nuntampered with, and unimpeachable, declare that for uncounted years\r\nIowa, together with the great valley of the Mississippi, lay beneath\r\nthe level of the sea. So far as it was inhabited at all, marine forms\r\nof animals and plants were its only occupants.\"\r\n\r\nThe soils of the state were produced by the action of the ice in what\r\nis known as the glacial period. We are told how by Professor Calvin:\r\n\r\n     \"Glaciers and glacial action have contributed in a very\r\n     large degree to the making of our magnificent State. What\r\n     Iowa would have been had it never suffered from the effects\r\n     of the ponderous ice sheets that successively overflowed its\r\n     surface, is illustrated, but not perfectly, in the driftless\r\n     area. Here we have an area that was not invaded by glaciers.\r\n     Allamakee, parts of Jackson, Dubuque, Clayton, Fayette, and\r\n     Winneshiek counties belong to the driftless area. During the\r\n     last two decades deep wells have been bored through the\r\n     loose surface deposit, and down into the underlying rocks.\r\n     The record of these wells shows that the rock surface is\r\n     very uneven. Before the glacial drift which now mantles\r\n     nearly the whole of Iowa was deposited, the surface had been\r\n     carved into an intricate system of hills and valleys. There\r\n     were narrow gorges hundreds of feet in depth, and there were\r\n     rugged, rocky cliffs, and isolated buttes corresponding in\r\n     height with the depth of the valleys.\r\n\r\n     \"To a person passing from the drift-covered to the driftless\r\n     part of the state, the topography presents a series of\r\n     surprises. The principal drainage streams flow in valleys\r\n     that measure, from the summits of the divides, six hundred\r\n     or more in depth. The Oneota, or Upper Iowa River, in\r\n     Allamakee county, for example, flows between picturesque\r\n     cliffs that rise almost vertically from three to four\r\n     hundred feet, while from the summit of the cliffs the land\r\n     rises gradually to the crest of the divide, three, four or\r\n     five miles back from the stream. Tributary streams cut the\r\n     lateral slopes and canyon walls at intervals. These again\r\n     have tributaries of the second order. In such a region a\r\n     quarter section of level land would be a curiosity. This is\r\n     a fair sample of what Iowa would have been had it not been\r\n     planed down by the leveling effects of the glaciers. Soils\r\n     of uniform excellence would have been impossible in a\r\n     non-glacial Iowa. The soils of Iowa have a value equal to\r\n     all of the silver and gold mines of the world combined.\r\n\r\n     \"And for this rich heritage of soils we are indebted to\r\n     great rivers of ice that overflowed Iowa from the north and\r\n     northwest. The glaciers in their long journey ground up the\r\n     rocks over which they moved and mingled the fresh rock flour\r\n     from granites of British America and northern Minnesota with\r\n     pulverized limestones and shales of more southern regions,\r\n     and used these rich materials in covering up the bald rocks\r\n     and leveling the irregular surface of preglacial Iowa. The\r\n     materials are in places hundreds of feet in depth. They are\r\n     not oxidized or leached, but retain the carbonates and other\r\n     soluble constituents that contribute so largely to the\r\n     growth of plants. The physical condition of the materials is\r\n     ideal, rendering the soil porous, facilitating the\r\n     distribution of moisture, and offering unmatched\r\n     opportunities for the employment of improved machinery in\r\n     all of the processes connected with cultivation. Even the\r\n     driftless area received great benefit from the action of\r\n     glaciers, for although the area was not invaded by ice, it\r\n     was yet to a large extent covered by a peculiar deposit\r\n     called loess, which is generally connected with one of the\r\n     later sheets of drift. The loess is a porous clay, rich in\r\n     carbonate of lime. Throughout the driftless area it has\r\n     covered up many spots that would otherwise have been bare\r\n     rocks. It covered the stiff intractable clays that would\r\n     otherwise have been the only soils of the region. It in\r\n     itself constitutes a soil of great fertility. Every part of\r\n     Iowa is debtor in some way to the great ice sheets of the\r\n     glacial period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Soils are everywhere the product of rock disintegration,\r\n     and so the quality of the soils in a given locality must\r\n     necessarily be determined in large measure by the kind of\r\n     rock from which they were derived.\r\n\r\n     \"From this point of view, therefore, the history of Iowa's\r\n     superb soils begins with first steps in rock making. The\r\n     very oldest rocks of the Mississippi Valley have contributed\r\n     something to making our soils what they are, and every later\r\n     formation laid down over the surface of Iowa, or regions\r\n     north of it, has furnished its quota of materials to the\r\n     same end. The history of Iowa's soils, therefore, embraces\r\n     the whole sweep of geologic times.\r\n\r\n     \"The chief agents concerned in modifying the surface\r\n     throughout most of Iowa since the disappearance of the\r\n     latest glaciers have been organic, although the physical and\r\n     chemical influences of air and water have not been without\r\n     marked effect. The growth and decay of a long series of\r\n     generations of plants have contributed certain organic\r\n     constituents to the soil. Earth worms bring up fine material\r\n     from considerable depths and place it in position to be\r\n     spread out upon the surface. They drag leaves and any\r\n     manageable portion of plants into their burrows, and much of\r\n     the material so taken down into the ground decays and\r\n     enriches the ground to a depth of several inches. The pocket\r\n     gopher has done much to furnish a surface layer of loose,\r\n     mellow, easily cultivated and highly productive soil. Like\r\n     the earth worm, the gopher for century after century has\r\n     been bringing up to the surface fine material, to the amount\r\n     of several tons annually to the acre, avoiding necessarily\r\n     the pebbles, cobbles and coarser constituents. The burrows\r\n     collapse, the undermined boulders and large fragments sink\r\n     downwards, rains and winds spread out the gopher hills and\r\n     worm castings, and the next year, and the next, the process\r\n     is repeated; and so it has been for all the years making up\r\n     the centuries since the close of the glacial epoch. Organic\r\n     agents in the form of plants and burrowing animals have\r\n     worked unremittingly through many centuries, and\r\n     accomplished a work of incalculable value in pulverizing,\r\n     mellowing and enriching the superficial stratum, and\r\n     bringing it to the ideal condition in which it was found by\r\n     the explorers and pioneers from whose advent dates the\r\n     historical period of our matchless Iowa.\"\r\n\r\nThe last invasion, we are informed, was from 100,000 to 170,000 years\r\nago--somewhat prior to the recollection of the \"oldest inhabitant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_The First Inhabitants_\r\n\r\n\r\nWho were Iowa's first inhabitants is a question of some interest.\r\nArcheologists tell us that there have been found in the Mississippi\r\nValley the remains of two distinct prehistoric races. The first human\r\nskulls discovered resemble those of the gorilla. These skulls indicate\r\na low degree of intelligence. The first inhabitants were but a grade\r\nabove the lower animals. They were small in body, and brute-like in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nNext came the \"mound builders.\" There are evidences that these had some\r\ndegree of intelligence. Copper and stone implements have been found in\r\nthe mounds. Whether they built towns and cities or tilled the soil is\r\nnot known. Pieces of cloth discovered in the mounds would indicate some\r\nknowledge of the arts. Their number, their size, color, customs--all\r\nare lost to us. We know they existed, and that is all. Several of these\r\nmounds have been explored in Iowa. They are found in the eastern parts\r\nof the state from Dubuque to Burlington. Many interesting articles have\r\nbeen found in them--sea shells, copper axes and spools, stone knives,\r\npottery, pipes carved with effigies of animals and birds. Skeletons and\r\naltars of stone were unearthed a few years ago in some of these mounds,\r\nand in one were discovered hieroglyphics representing letters and\r\nfigures of trees, people and animals.\r\n\r\nThese mounds have also been discovered in the central part of the\r\nstate, the valley of the Des Moines river being especially rich in\r\nthem. Sometimes they are in groups, as though built for defense. It has\r\nbeen suggested that probably the conquerors of the mound builders were\r\nthe immediate ancestors of the Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen on June 25, 1673, Marquette and Joliet fastened their frail craft\r\nto the west bank of the Mississippi river where the Iowa enters it in\r\nLouisa county,[A] the only people living in what is now Iowa were the\r\nAmerican Indians. When these venturesome explorers came ashore and\r\nascended a slight eminence they beheld a scene of rare beauty. As far\r\nas the eye could carry they looked over an expanse covered with green\r\ngrass waving in the gentle wind like the billows of the sea, with here\r\nand there a grove of oak, elm, walnut, maple, and sycamore. All was\r\npeaceful, calm, and restful; the stillness of the desert prevailed.\r\nThat the country was inhabited was indicated by a thin column of smoke\r\nwhich arose some few miles inland from a small grove. The travelers\r\nsoon reached the spot. There they found a small company of Indians in a\r\nvillage on the banks of the stream. The Indians were probably the more\r\nastonished of the two parties. They looked with wonder upon the strange\r\nbeings who had come among them so unceremoniously and unannounced. It\r\nwas probably their first view of the white man. Recovering somewhat\r\nfrom their astonishment, they made overtures of friendship by offering\r\nthe pipe of peace.\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered that the band was a portion of the Illinois\r\ntribe. Marquette had enough acquaintance with the language of this\r\ntribe to enable him to hold an intelligent conversation with his hosts.\r\nHe told the Indians who their visitors were, and why they were there.\r\nHe expressed the great pleasure he and his companions took at meeting\r\nsome of the inhabitants of that beautiful country. They in turn were\r\ngiven a cordial welcome by the Indians, one of the chiefs thus\r\naddressing them:\r\n\r\n     \"I thank the Black Gown Chief [Marquette] and his friend\r\n     [Joliet] for taking so much pains to come and visit us.\r\n     Never before has the earth been so beautiful, nor the sun so\r\n     bright as now. Never has the river been so calm or free from\r\n     rocks which your canoes have removed as they passed down.\r\n     Never has the tobacco had so fine a flavor, nor our corn\r\n     appeared so beautiful as we behold it today. Ask the Great\r\n     Spirit to give us life and health, and come ye and dwell\r\n     with us.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an eloquent speech and demonstrated the sincerity of the\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nMarquette and Joliet were then invited to a feast which meanwhile had\r\nbeen made ready by the squaws. Afterwards Marquette wrote a description\r\nof this banquet, and it is of interest to reproduce it here:\r\n\r\n     \"It consisted of four courses. First there was a large\r\n     wooden bowl filled with a preparation of corn meal boiled in\r\n     water and seasoned with oil. The Indian conducting the\r\n     ceremonies had a large wooden spoon with which he dipped up\r\n     the mixture (called by the Indians _tagamity_), passing it\r\n     in turn into the mouths of the different members of the\r\n     party. The second course consisted of fish nicely cooked,\r\n     which was separated from the bones and placed in the mouths\r\n     of the guests. The third course was a roasted dog, which our\r\n     explorers declined with thanks, when it was at once removed\r\n     from sight. The last course was a roast of buffalo, the\r\n     fattest pieces of which were passed the Frenchmen, who found\r\n     it to be most excellent meat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen were so delighted with the beauty of the country and the\r\nhospitality of the Indians that they remained with their friends six\r\ndays. They explored the valleys, hunted and fished and feasted on the\r\nchoice game they captured. The natives did all they could to make their\r\nstay one gay round of pleasure. They welcomed the coming guests with\r\ngenuine hospitality, and when they could keep them no longer speeded\r\nthem on their way in the true spirit. Six hundred of them escorted\r\nMarquette and Joliet to their boats and wished them bon voyage.\r\n\r\nThis discovery attracted but little attention at the time in Europe,\r\nand many years passed before what is now known as Iowa appears in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUND BUILDERS\r\n\r\nThe Mound Builders, from what information we have been able to obtain,\r\nmust have lived in the Mississippi valley and at one time or another\r\nway back in some remote age they must have resided on what later became\r\nIowa. Chronology is not definite as to when or how the Mound Builders\r\narrived in the new world. It is merely speculation when one says that\r\ntraditions point to a time two or three thousand years ago when the\r\nMound Builders resided in the Mississippi valley and lived in villages\r\nand towns. It is true, that in various parts of the old world records\r\nhave been found of other races which have preceded the races of which\r\nhistory has any definite record. As the North American Indians had no\r\nwritten language prior to the arrival of the Europeans, their\r\ntraditions, consequently, go back but a short time at best.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there have been found on the American continent various\r\nbones of animals which no longer exist, and there have been found\r\nrelics of a race of men who were far different from the Indians as the\r\nwhites found them on their arrival. In North America these pre-historic\r\nraces have been called Mound Builders, and they have been the first\r\ninhabitants of the vast plains of what later became the United States.\r\nStill, it may be possible that the Mound Builders may have driven out\r\nor exterminated some other preceding race of people, who had dwelt in\r\nthis country for ages before the Mound Builders made their entrance\r\ninto what is known as the New World. Who knows?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B. L. WICK]\r\n\r\nIn Johnson's _Encyclopedia_, Vol. 1, page 125, one finds the following:\r\n\"Remains of the Mound Builders are spread over a vast extent of\r\ncountry. They are found on the sources of the Alleghany, in the western\r\npart of the state of New York, and in nearly all the western states,\r\nincluding Michigan and Iowa. They were observed by Lewis and Clark on\r\nthe Missouri a thousand miles above its junction with the Mississippi.\r\nThey lined the shores of the Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida,\r\nwhence they extended through Alabama and Georgia into South Carolina.\r\nThey are especially numerous in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,\r\nMissouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi,\r\nAlabama, Georgia, Florida, and Texas. Many of these remnants were\r\nevidently designed as works of defense or as large towers in war. No\r\ninconsiderable number appear to have been formed as sepulchre monuments\r\nor as places of burial for the dead, while others seemed obviously to\r\nhave been constructed as temples or places of worship or sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Linn county and Iowa have not as many mounds of as much interest\r\nas, for example, the Circle Mound in Ohio, still there are a number of\r\nmounds found in eastern Iowa and a number in Linn county which would\r\nappear to have been constructed by Mound Builders, or, at least, by\r\nsome pre-historic race long since extinct. Some mounds found near Palo\r\nwould indicate that they must have been constructed a long time ago,\r\nfor even trees of large dimensions have been found growing on top and\r\naround these mounds. The remnants certainly give evidence in places as\r\nthough they had been constructed for religious purposes, which\r\nevidently is true of nearly all such remnants which have recently been\r\ndiscovered in Yucatan and Mexico.\r\n\r\nSome stone implements and ornaments have been found in some of these\r\nmounds. These implements are all flint spear and arrow heads and have\r\nbeen worked with much care and skill. Some pottery has also been\r\ndiscovered, at times ornamented and at other times very coarse. Some\r\ncopper implements have been found of a kind and quality as discovered\r\nin the copper region of Lake Superior, which, undoubtedly, have been\r\nworked by the Indians and perhaps by the Mound Builders. No bones have\r\nso far been discovered to indicate that the Mound Builders had the use\r\nof any domestic animals. Very seldom have human skeletons been found,\r\nwhich might attest to the fact that these had been dug ages and ages\r\nago. No tablets of any kind have been discovered, which might indicate\r\nthat the Mound Builders had at no time a written language.\r\n\r\nScience has held that the Mound Builders were an agricultural people\r\nand compared with the Indians much more civilized, and that the\r\nMississippi valley was densely populated until the arrival of the\r\nIndians. Whether the Indians exterminated them or they were driven\r\naway, or they voluntarily removed from this part of the country is\r\nstill a debatable question.\r\n\r\n     \"If it is really true that there were pre-historic peoples,\r\n     then the oldest continent would be, in all probability, the\r\n     first inhabited; and as this is the oldest continent in the\r\n     formations of the geological period, and as there are found\r\n     relics of man in England in identically the same strata as\r\n     are shown in Linn county, why may we not reasonably expect\r\n     to find relics of man--relics as old as any--in Linn county?\r\n     If man once existed here, why may he not have always existed\r\n     here? It is certainly unreasonable to think young Europe\r\n     should alone have early relics of man.\r\n\r\n     \"What place the Mound Builders are entitled to in the\r\n     world's history, since they have left no relics but mounds\r\n     of earth, which mounds are probably funeral pyres or places\r\n     of sepulchre, we can simply conjecture. We believe some rude\r\n     carvings on slabs have been exhumed at Grand Traverse,\r\n     Michigan, Davenport, Iowa, and Rockford, Illinois. These\r\n     carvings may have reference to the sun, moon and stars; we\r\n     believe the savants favor such an interpretation. As to\r\n     where he lived, careful geological study of his mound may\r\n     some day determine. He was a link in the chain of man's\r\n     existence; tracing it to its source we may discover some\r\n     hitherto unknown facts regarding man's origin, or the\r\n     ancient history of America. This continent may have been\r\n     more intimately connected with Asia than is at present\r\n     considered....\r\n\r\n     \"Compare the average life of these nations with the age of\r\n     the Cedar valley; compare historic age with Cedar valley,\r\n     whose channel has been cut down through the rocks between\r\n     one and two hundred feet. Look at these old Devonian rocks,\r\n     with their fossils as fresh as of yesterday. Look at the\r\n     clay soil that overlies the rocks. Has it been changed in\r\n     fourteen hundred or in six thousand years? Now look at those\r\n     mounds that are on the crests of so many ridges, and say how\r\n     old they are! Forests of giant trees have come and gone over\r\n     them, how many times? Those mounds were built by the people\r\n     known as the Mound Builders. What of their life? What of\r\n     their age? What of their history? We have the mounds, and\r\n     substantially the mounds only. But these mounds are an\r\n     interesting study of themselves. We have not observed these\r\n     mounds only in the valley of the Cedar river, above and\r\n     below Cedar Rapids; our observations find them in positions\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"LOCATION OF MOUNDS NEAR CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA\r\n\r\n                                                          Number\r\n                                                            of\r\n     No.      Location            Sec.

The correct location, I believe, is from\r\n     south to north; that is, they point to the north. These\r\n     mounds are now raised about three feet above the level, and\r\n     are uniformly thirty feet in diameter. Counting from the\r\n     south, the sixth and seventh are generally within a few\r\n     feet--come very near touching each other; the others are as\r\n     near as, may be, two diameters apart. These remarks will\r\n     apply to No. 2, No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6. No. 2 has eleven in\r\n     a line (as No. 1,) and then three mounds to the east appear\r\n     to be parallel, and may have had the remaining eight removed\r\n     by cultivation. No. 4 is on the bottom--second bench land;\r\n     are a little larger in size; the others, to make out the\r\n     eleven, may have been destroyed by cultivation. No. 7 has\r\n     eight in position, and then a valley intervenes, and the\r\n     three additional, making the eleven, are on the ridge next\r\n     to the north. No. 8 has twelve. They are on the crest of a\r\n     divide which passes around the head of a deep ravine, and\r\n     follow the divide at the angle. Most of these mounds (No. 8)\r\n     have been lately opened, but we think no relics were found.\r\n     We have been careful to find the place that the earth\r\n     composing the mounds was taken from. Generally, the banks\r\n     of a near ravine indicate, by their shape, the place. Under\r\n     the strongest sunlight, in a mound cut through the center,\r\n     we could detect no indication or difference in the clay to\r\n     show that it had been removed or disturbed, or that there\r\n     had been any remains in it to discolor the clay in their\r\n     decomposition.\r\n\r\n     \"Let it be observed that the mounds are substantially north\r\n     and south in line of location. They are eleven in number,\r\n     uniform in size, and, I believe, cover every ridge in the\r\n     vicinity of the rapids of the Cedar having the direction\r\n     sufficient in length on which the mounds could be placed.\r\n     They are built in the locality the least likely to be\r\n     disturbed, and in the shape and of the material the most\r\n     enduring. There certainly was intelligence displayed in\r\n     their location and in the selection of the material of which\r\n     they are constructed, as well as in the design of their form\r\n     and positions. There may have been more mounds than these,\r\n     but these are all that are left--all that are left of that\r\n     race which might have sent from their number emigrants to\r\n     people the new land, to the far west, the last continent,\r\n     fresh and vigorous from the ocean, the newest born, the best\r\n     then adapted for man's material and mental\r\n     development.\"--_History of Linn County_, 1878, p. 319.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Newberry, in Johnson's _Cyclopedia_, says:\r\n\r\n     \"From all the facts before us, we can at present say little\r\n     more than this, that the valley of the Mississippi and the\r\n     Atlantic coast were once densely populated by a sedentary,\r\n     agricultural and partially civilized race, quite different\r\n     from the modern nomadic Indians, though, possibly, the\r\n     progenitors of some of the Indian tribes; and that, after\r\n     many centuries of occupation, they disappeared from our\r\n     country at least one thousand, perhaps many thousands of\r\n     years, before the advent of the Europeans. The pre-historic\r\n     remains found so abundantly in Arizona appear to be related\r\n     to the civilization of Mexico; and the remains of\r\n     semi-civilized Indian tribes now found there are, perhaps,\r\n     descendants of the ancient builders of the great houses and\r\n     cities whose ruins are found there.\"\r\n\r\nResearches concerning ancient mounds have been carried on in a most\r\nscientific manner by Dr. Cyrus Thomas. His chief work and research have\r\nbeen embodied in a monograph of over 700 pages and found the 12th\r\nReport of the government publications.\r\n\r\nMajor J. W. Powell, whose studies of this subject have been considered\r\nauthoritative, in his _Pre-historic Man in America_ has the following\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n     \"Widely scattered throughout the United States ...\r\n     artificial mounds are discovered which may be enumerated by\r\n     thousands and hundreds of thousands. They vary greatly in\r\n     size. Some are small so that half a dozen laborers with\r\n     shovels might construct one of them in a day, while others\r\n     cover acres and are scores of feet in height. These mounds\r\n     were observed by the early explorers and pioneers of the\r\n     country.... Pseud-archeologists descanted on the Mound\r\n     Builders, that once inhabited the land, and they told of\r\n     swarming populations who had reached a high condition of\r\n     culture, erecting temples, practicing arts in metals and\r\n     using hieroglyphics.... It is enough to say that the Mound\r\n     Builders were the Indian tribes discovered by the white men.\r\n     It may well be that some of the mounds were erected by\r\n     tribes extinct when Columbus first saw the shores, but they\r\n     were kindred in culture to the peoples that still\r\n     existed.... Pre-Columbian culture was indigenous, it began\r\n     at the lowest stage of savagery and developed to the highest\r\n     and was in many places passing into barbarism when the good\r\n     queen sold her jewels.\"--J. W. Powell, quoted in _Larned_,\r\n     Vol. I, p. 45.\r\n\r\nThus scientists do not agree whether or not the Mound Builders were\r\nclosely akin to the Indians. However recent investigators seem to agree\r\nwith Thomas and Powell that the early inhabitants were much like the\r\nlater denizens of the American prairies in their mode of life and means\r\nof subsistence, in their weapons, arts, usages, and customs, in their\r\ninstitutions and physical characteristics, they were the same people in\r\ndifferent stages of advancement.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske, one of the scholarly writers on American history, has the\r\nfollowing to say on the early races in the United States:\r\n\r\n     \"Whether the Indians are descended from this ancient\r\n     population or not, is a question with which we have as yet\r\n     no satisfactory method of dealing. It is not unlikely that\r\n     these glacial men may have perished from off the face of the\r\n     earth, having been crushed and supplanted by stronger races.\r\n     There may have been several successive waves of migration of\r\n     which the Indians were the latest.\"--Fiske's _Discovery of\r\n     America_, Vol. I, p. 15.\r\n\r\n     \"The aboriginal American, as we know him with his language\r\n     and legends, his physical and mental peculiarities, his\r\n     social observance and customs, is most emphatically a native\r\n     and not an imported article. He belongs to the American\r\n     continent as strictly as its opossums and armadillo, its\r\n     maize and its golden rods, or any number of its aboriginal\r\n     fauna and flora belong to it.\"--_Ibid._, p. 20.\r\n\r\nAn Iowa investigator, C. L. Webster, some years ago examined several\r\nmounds on the banks of the Cedar river near Charles City and \"found the\r\nskulls small which would show an extremely low grade of mental\r\nintelligence.\"--_American Naturalist_, Vol. 23, p. 1888.\r\n\r\nThis may go to show that the early inhabitants were different from the\r\nnomadic Indians that the first whites saw as they landed on the bleak\r\nshores of New England in the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nMost writers on this subject are led to believe that we have conclusive\r\nevidence that man existed before the time of the glaciers and that from\r\nprimitive conditions he has lived here and developed through the same\r\nstages which may correspond to the development of primitive man in\r\nEurope and Asia. Whether the first settlers in Iowa then, were Mound\r\nBuilders, or Indians, or some other race may never be known, for a\r\ncertainty. It is enough to say, that man existed and lived on what has\r\nbecome known as Iowa many, many centuries ago, and he left few if any\r\nremains which can testify to his stage of development or to his mode of\r\nliving. This is no doubt true, that man existed in Linn county\r\ncountless ages ago, but whether it was a different race, or simply the\r\nIndian race at a different stage of development may never be known and\r\nthus will always remain a mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANS\r\n\r\nWhen the first white settlers located in Linn county the Red Men still\r\noccupied the land, and even after treaties had been fully ratified,\r\nIndians were slow to give up these choice hunting places along the Red\r\nCedar and the Wapsie. It is needless to say that the rights of Indians\r\nwere not protected and they invariably were set aside and driven away\r\nas fast as possible. Still nearly all of the early settlers were very\r\nfriendly toward the Red Men, and in return received many favors from\r\ntheir hands. Of course, the Red Men were jealous of the whites, who\r\ngradually kept coming in and drove the Indians away. The Indians who\r\nmost frequented this part of Iowa after the settlement by whites were\r\nthe Sac and Fox and Winnebagoes. The Winnebagoes were a remnant of a\r\nwarlike tribe, and at one time in Wisconsin were very powerful. These\r\njoined with the Sac and Fox in the Black Hawk war and were driven\r\nacross the Mississippi river after the signing of the treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEWIS FIELD LINN]\r\n\r\nThe pioneers in this county from necessity had to be friendly with the\r\nIndians. Many of the early settlers were able to speak the Winnebago\r\nlanguage, such as the family of William Abbe, the Edgertons, the Usher\r\nfamily, the Crows, and many others. The Winnebagoes lingered around in\r\nthis part of Iowa in the thirties and forties, when they were finally\r\nremoved to Minnesota, much against their own wishes. But the Indians,\r\nrightly in this respect as in many others, were not considered, for the\r\nwhite men ruled and looked out for their own selfish interests and did\r\nnot consider the side of mercy, justice or the rights of the weak as\r\nagainst those of the strong.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebagoes were considered a hardy race and respected by the\r\nwhites, who showed them many favors. While the Winnebagoes had fought\r\nin the war of 1812 under Tecumseh and had sided with Black Hawk,\r\nperhaps reluctantly, in the war of 1832, they were rather friendly\r\ntoward the whites, although they very much objected to disposing of all\r\ntheir lands east of the Mississippi river by the treaties of 1825 and\r\n1837, when they were removed to Iowa. In Linn county they remained for\r\na longer or shorter period of time along the rivers such as the Cedar\r\nand the Wapsie, and especially around Cedar Lake, along the Palisades,\r\nin Linn Grove, Scotch Grove west of Cedar Rapids, and in other places\r\nwhere there was much timber. While they were at times heartless and\r\ncruel, their relations on the whole with the early settlers in Linn\r\ncounty were those of friendship, and they showed the whites many favors\r\nin the early days when the scattered pioneer families were unable to\r\nacquire sufficient food during the winter months to subsist upon. The\r\nIndians always helped the whites, and frequently went out hunting,\r\nbringing back a deer, fowls, or prairie chickens, which they divided\r\namong their own people and the whites. They early became fond of the\r\ndishes made by the white women, such as hominy, honey cakes, johnny\r\ncakes, and other delicious dishes found in the homes of the early\r\nsettlers on the frontier. In no instance has it been reported that any\r\nwhite woman was ever assaulted by any Indian in this county. In many of\r\nthe cabins of the early settlers there could be found only women and\r\nchildren, the husbands having left for the river towns to bring back\r\nprovisions, and this fact was frequently known to the Indians. The\r\nearly pioneer women used to say that they feared the rough border\r\nruffian more than they did these traveling bands of Indians, who never\r\nassaulted anyone or ever carried away property by stealth, as the\r\nborder ruffians were frequently accused of doing.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Winnebago tribe of Indians can not be passed without\r\nsome notice. The name Winnebago is said to mean \"the turbid water\r\npeople,\" and they are closely related to the Iowas, Otoes, and the\r\nMissouri tribes. They used to call themselves the Hochangara, meaning\r\n\"the people using the parent tongue,\" thus, perhaps, intending to\r\nconvey that they were the original people from whom others sprang. They\r\nare first mentioned in the Jesuit Relations of 1636 and 1640. It is\r\nsaid that they were nearly annihilated by the Illinois tribes in early\r\ndays and that the survivors fled back to Green Bay in 1737 and that\r\nthey resided on the banks of Lake Superior but once more drifted back\r\nto Green Bay and towards Lake Winnebago, stretching southwest towards\r\nthe Mississippi river. On one of the islands in the lake which bears\r\ntheir name they made their abiding place for a number of years and here\r\nthey buried their dead and dwelt in peace around their fire places.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the population was estimated to be 6,000. By the treaties of\r\n1825 and 1832 they were compelled to cede their lands to the\r\ngovernment, certain tracts of land being reserved on the Mississippi\r\nriver near what is now known as La Crosse. Here they suffered from\r\nseveral visitations of smallpox, which plague is said to have carried\r\noff nearly one-fourth of their number.\r\n\r\nFrom 1834-35 they were removed to Iowa and lived along the many rivers\r\nin the northeastern part of the Territory as far as the banks of the\r\nCedar and the Wapsie rivers. White settlers came in, driving the Red\r\nMen out: hunting became poor and the Indians could not subsist and\r\nthey were again removed to the Blue Earth reservation in Minnesota in\r\n1848. On account of the Indian outbreaks in 1863, committed by the\r\nSioux tribe, and in which the Winnebagoes took no part, they were again\r\nremoved to the Dakotas, where several hundred perished from cold and\r\nhunger. There are now only about 1,200 under the Omaha and Winnebago\r\nagency in Nebraska, and about 1,500 in the state of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe Sac and Fox were also the early neighbors of the whites in this\r\ncounty. The Fox was an Algonkian tribe, first found on the lakes, and\r\nwho were driven south by the Ojibwa where, for self protection, they\r\nunited with the Sacs and have been since known as Sacs and Foxes. They\r\nwere always friendly to the British, joining them in the Revolution as\r\nwell as in the war of 1812. After the Black Hawk war they were removed\r\nto Iowa and from here removed again to the Indian Territory from\r\n1842-46. Many of the tribes kept coming back to their old hunting\r\nground and finally they were permitted to remain on the Iowa river and\r\nprovision for them was made by the legislature. About 400, known as the\r\nMuskwaki, are still found, survivors of some of the early wanderers in\r\neastern Iowa in the early thirties. The Sacs and Foxes and the\r\nWinnebagoes were always on friendly terms with the whites and were\r\nsworn enemies of the Sioux.\r\n\r\nMrs. Susan Shields, a daughter of William Abbe, was on intimate terms\r\nwith the Winnebago Indians, who used to gather at her father's home on\r\nAbbe's creek frequently. She learned to speak the Winnebago language,\r\nand remembered seeing many wigwams, or tepees as they were called, at\r\nthe lower end of what is now Cedar Rapids. She speaks of the Indians as\r\nbeing kind to her and that her first playmates were Indian girls of her\r\nown age. Her brothers also played with the Indian boys and they learned\r\nto ride Indian ponies and to shoot with bows and arrows. No trouble\r\never arose among the young of both races in these days; rather the\r\nwhite boys were envious to see the liberties granted the Indian boys\r\nand how they were permitted to roam any place at pleasure, never having\r\nany chores to do.\r\n\r\nRobert Ellis understood more or less of the Indian jargon, and still\r\nspeaks of his many escapades among the Sioux, the Winnebago, and the\r\nSac and Fox. At one time, about 1839, some 300 Winnebagoes were camped\r\non what is known as McCloud's Run. It was late in the fall and very\r\ncold; word came in the night that the Sioux were coming to exterminate\r\nthe tribe. At once they broke camp and forded the river near the mill\r\ndam, first getting the women and children across. The white settlers\r\nwere frightened. By nine o'clock the next morning the camps were up on\r\nthe west side of the river and the gay young bucks had brought in\r\nthirty-eight deer which had been shot during the early morning, which\r\nwere served to the hungry lot who had worked all night. While the Sioux\r\nhad been in the neighborhood no attack was made upon the Winnebagoes at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellis also relates that he and two friends camped one night on the\r\nCedar above Waterloo, where they were hunting. One morning in\r\nmid-winter a party of Sioux came to the cabin. They could do nothing\r\nbut invite the Red Men in and offer them provisions and anything they\r\nhad. While the Indians kicked against the whites killing their game,\r\nthe friendliness of the whites seemed to satisfy them, and they left\r\ntheir new found friends in possession of their camps. After this\r\ndiscovery by the Sioux Mr. Ellis and his friends made a hasty retreat,\r\nnot wanting to meet their dusky companions again when they might return\r\nin larger numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. Ellis relates another incident of his life among the Indians. He\r\ncame to an Indian camp near Quasqueton on his way to Ft. Atkinson and\r\nhad to spend the night in the camp. Unfortunately nearly all of the\r\nIndians were drunk and insisted on killing every one. The squaws, who\r\nwere sober, and a few of the old men, got Mr. Ellis to help, and all\r\nthe drunken bucks were tied so they could scarcely move. Mr. Ellis then\r\nretired, and in the morning all were sober and untied, and then the\r\nsquaws and the old men who had been sober started in to get gloriously\r\ndrunk. Mr. Ellis wanted to hire an Indian to show him the way to West\r\nUnion, but the Indian shrugged his shoulders and replied, \"wolf eaty\r\nyou.\" Mr. Ellis started out alone afoot over the snow covered prairie\r\non a cold winter day and finally reached a cabin late at night, nearly\r\novercome from cold. He still believes he would have perished if it had\r\nnot been for the words of the old Indian which kept ringing in his ears\r\nall day and which added courage to his exhausted spirits.\r\n\r\nAt one time a large number of Muskwaki Indians were camping near Indian\r\ncreek, and as the winter was severe and snow deep the Indians were out\r\nof food. They came to the home of Susan Doty, who gave them the best\r\nand only thing she had--hominy--which she warmed on the fire and gave\r\nto the Red Men, who expressed their thanks by grunting and continually\r\nasking for more, till the entire supply was exhausted. From that time,\r\nwhen the Indians returned from the hunt with a deer or two Mrs. Doty\r\nwas always remembered with a good share of game.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians lost ponies they would go to the old settlers like\r\nUsher, N. B. Brown, the Hunters, Oxleys, or Dotys, asking them to\r\nassist in catching the thieves. One day Usher and Brown came to Doty's\r\nwith an Indian chief who had lost his pony. Hunter was also called in,\r\nand off the party started in pursuit of the horsethief, who was caught\r\nnear Viola and who made himself scarce at once, for he was branded as\r\nan outlaw by the Indians, who would shoot him at sight. The Indian was\r\nmore than happy in getting back his pony. These men who were willing to\r\nhelp the Indians were sure to get anything they cared for which could\r\nbe procured by the red brother. A white man who would help an Indian to\r\nrecover stolen property was forever a friend of the Indians of the\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in Linn county during the thirties and forties dressed in\r\nskins, lived in tepees, and owned ponies; all wore government blankets\r\nand had guns, also procured from the government. The men and women\r\ndressed much the same. The women carried home the game, looked after\r\nthe tepee, made maple sugar, which was traded to the whites for sugar,\r\nflour, and woolen goods. Flour especially was much relished by the\r\nIndians. The localities much frequented by the Indians were along the\r\nRed Cedar and Wapsie rivers, Cedar lake, Indian creek, the Palisades,\r\nLinn Grove, Scotch Grove, and Prairie creek. In these places they would\r\nremain for weeks at a time, when they would all pull up and leave on\r\nsome hunting trip, not returning till in the fall or spring of the\r\nyear. Where they went to no one knew, and where they came from no one\r\ninquired. But the Red Men in early days in this county were all treated\r\nwith due courtesy by the whites, who, in turn, were spared by the\r\nIndians. The best of feeling always existed among the whites and\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux very seldom came into this part of Iowa. William Abbe and\r\nRobert Ellis were the agents for the government in supplying the\r\nWinnebago Indians at Ft. Atkinson with food, thus these men were well\r\nacquainted with the Winnebagoes, who, in turn, were on terms of\r\nfriendship with the Sacs and Foxes. The Winnebagoes, like the other\r\ntribes, became addicted to the use of fire water to such an extent that\r\nthey would sell their guns and ammunition for whiskey. One of the early\r\nexperiences of W. H. Merritt as a young store keeper at Ivanhoe was to\r\nclean out the store single-handed of a crowd of drunken Indians who\r\nintended to take possession of the store for a sufficient length of\r\ntime at least till they could consume the large quantity of whiskey\r\nstored therein, but they had not figured on the courage of the young\r\nman who later distinguished himself during the Civil war. Young Mr.\r\nMerritt drove out the intruders and saved the store, as well as the\r\nproperty of the company for which he worked.\r\n\r\nMany of the old settlers tell stories of the quantity and variety of\r\nfood these wandering tribes of Indians were capable of consuming, which\r\nseemed to be beyond the comprehension of the white man. Mr. Ellis\r\nrelates how he and William Abbe were notified to forthwith procure beef\r\ncattle for an Indian conference at Ft. Atkinson. These men promptly\r\ndrove a large number of young cattle to Ft. Atkinson from Linn county,\r\nand the Indians consumed in a very short time rations which were\r\nexpected to have lasted for several weeks.\r\n\r\nOthers have left records of straggling bands of Indians who were fed at\r\nsome pioneer cabin and consumed quantities of food at a sitting several\r\ntimes more than the ordinary white man could eat in a week. But then it\r\nmust be remembered that these Indians did not have their regular meals\r\nthree times a day, by any means. They seemed to go for days and for a\r\nweek without eating much of anything, and when a feast was set before\r\nthem they did full justice to the repast.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had an abnormal fondness for sweets. The making of maple\r\nsugar, especially in Wisconsin, had been one of the industries of the\r\naborigines; a little was always made in Iowa. The season for sugar\r\nmaking came when the first crow appeared; this occurred about the first\r\nof March, while there was yet snow on the ground. As a substitute for\r\nsugar the Indians were very fond of honey, and it was said by the early\r\nsettlers that the squaws could smell a bee tree further than anyone\r\nelse. These bee trees were claimed by the Indians, and woe to the white\r\nman's son who by stealth or otherwise would encroach upon the Indian's\r\nrights in this regard.\r\n\r\nWhile the Indians were called cruel and merciless during the Black Hawk\r\nwar and later, the pioneers of Linn county found them friendly,\r\nhospitable, devoted and loyal friends. Many instances have been cited\r\nhow the Red Men risked their own lives even to assist their white\r\nfriends. While they never forgave an injury, they never forgot a deed\r\nof kindness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCENE ON THE CEDAR RIVER AT CEDAR RAPIDS IN THE\r\nFIFTIES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESIDENCE OF ISAAC CARROLL IN 1839]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Iowa Historically_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe take the liberty of quoting here a chapter from \"The Louisiana\r\nPurchase,\" by C. M. Geer, in _The History of North America_, Vol. VIII,\r\nedited by Guy Carleton Lee, and published by George Barrie & Sons,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1904. It gives in brief space the more important\r\nhistorical facts connected with the formation of the State.\r\n\r\n     \"The governmental experiences of Iowa before its admission\r\n     into the Union as a State were many and varied. Its\r\n     discoverers were the missionary priest Jacques Marquette and\r\n     the explorer Louis Joliet, who were living at St. Mary's,\r\n     the oldest settlement in the present State of Michigan. On\r\n     May 13, 1673, with five Canadian boatmen, these two men left\r\n     on an exploring expedition, and on June 25, 1673, landed\r\n     near the mouth of Des Moines River.[B] By right of discovery\r\n     France claimed jurisdiction over the country thus visited\r\n     until 1763, when the Territory was ceded to Spain. On\r\n     October 1, 1800, it was ceded with the rest of Louisiana\r\n     Territory from Spain back to France. On the 30th of April,\r\n     1803, it was in turn ceded to the United States by France as\r\n     a part of the Louisiana Purchase.\r\n\r\n     \"These changes of government had little effect upon what was\r\n     to constitute the future State of Iowa, because the Indians\r\n     remained in almost undisputed possession. Although\r\n     discovered and claimed by France in 1673, no attempt at\r\n     settlement was made until 1788, when Julian Dubuque, a\r\n     Canadian, obtained from Blondeau and two other Indian chiefs\r\n     a grant of lands. This claim was twenty-one miles long and\r\n     extended from the Mississippi westward nine miles. The grant\r\n     was confirmed, in a qualified way, by Carondelet, Spanish\r\n     governor at New Orleans. Dubuque engaged in mining and\r\n     trading with the Indians, making his headquarters at the\r\n     place which now bears his name. The question of the validity\r\n     of his claim to this great tract of land came before the\r\n     United States Supreme Court in 1854, and the decision of\r\n     that body was that his grant was only a temporary license to\r\n     dig ore.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1799, a trading post was established on the Mississippi\r\n     within the present territory of Iowa. This settlement and\r\n     the one at Dubuque were abandoned, so that Iowa was\r\n     practically an unknown and undesired country at the time\r\n     when it came under the control of the United States in 1803.\r\n     It was at that time Indian territory, occupied by the Sacs,\r\n     Foxes, and Iowas, with the still more warlike Sioux on the\r\n     north and east.\r\n\r\n     \"On the 31st of October, 1803, a temporary government was\r\n     authorized for the recently acquired territory. By Act of\r\n     Congress, approved March 26, 1803, Louisiana was erected\r\n     into two Territories and provision made for the\r\n     administration of each. The upper part was known as the\r\n     District of Louisiana and included Arkansas, Missouri, and\r\n     Iowa. This was placed temporarily under the jurisdiction of\r\n     the Territory of Indiana. On July 4, 1805, all this northern\r\n     district became the Territory of Louisiana, with a separate\r\n     Territorial government. The legislative power was vested in\r\n     the governor and three judges to be appointed by the\r\n     President and Senate. This condition continued until\r\n     December 7, 1812, when the Territory of Louisiana became the\r\n     Territory of Missouri. In 1821, Missouri was admitted into\r\n     the Union, and this admission of Missouri carried with it\r\n     the abolition of the government of Missouri Territory, so\r\n     that for a time Iowa was without any government. It is a\r\n     question how much law remained in force in Iowa after the\r\n     admission of Missouri. It is probable that the only civil\r\n     law in force was the proviso of the Missouri bill, which\r\n     prohibited slavery north of thirty-six degrees thirty\r\n     minutes north latitude. No provision was made for that\r\n     portion of the Territory of Missouri until June 28, 1834,\r\n     when Congress attached the present State of Iowa, together\r\n     with other territory, to the Territory of Michigan.\r\n\r\n     \"On July 3, 1836, it was included in the newly organized\r\n     Territory of Wisconsin. On June 12, 1838, the Territory of\r\n     Iowa was constituted by Act of Congress. This Territory\r\n     included 'all that part of the present Territory of\r\n     Wisconsin which lies west of Mississippi River and west of a\r\n     line due north from the sources or headwaters of the\r\n     Mississippi to the territorial line.'\r\n\r\n     \"From the time of the purchase in 1803 up to the date of the\r\n     organization of the Territory in 1838 there had been a\r\n     gradual increase in the knowledge of this land and a growing\r\n     appreciation of its value. There had been parties of hunters\r\n     and trappers who made temporary settlements on the banks of\r\n     the Mississippi in the period from 1820 to 1830. It was not\r\n     till steam navigation was established on the Mississippi\r\n     that there grew up a demand for Iowa lands. Southeastern\r\n     Illinois and northwestern Missouri were settled and the\r\n     pioneers naturally looked to the equally desirable lands in\r\n     Iowa. Various exploring expeditions also contributed to a\r\n     desire to settle in the territory. Lewis and Clark added to\r\n     the knowledge of its western borders by their expedition in\r\n     1805. Pike in the same year traversed another part of the\r\n     Territory, and these explorers brought back accounts of its\r\n     great fertility and of its desirability for settlement.\r\n\r\n     \"The government established a broad strip of neutral ground\r\n     between the Sioux in the north and the Sacs and Foxes in the\r\n     south to keep these tribes at peace, and in 1830 acquired\r\n     lands on the Missouri to be used as Indian reservations.\r\n     Here and there in the Iowa Territory were white men who had\r\n     gained the friendship of the Indians and lived with them.\r\n     There were trading posts of the American Fur Company and\r\n     miners at Dubuque, who were licensed by the government to\r\n     work at that point. Iowa remained the home of the Indians\r\n     until the close of the Black Hawk War, when General Winfield\r\n     Scott, on September 15, 1832, concluded a treaty of peace\r\n     with the Sacs and Foxes, by which the Indian title was\r\n     extinguished to that part of land known as the Black Hawk\r\n     Purchase. This was the eastern part of Iowa and extended\r\n     along the Mississippi, from Missouri on the south to the\r\n     'Neutral Grounds' on the north, and westward a distance of\r\n     fifty miles. It contained about six million acres and was to\r\n     be surrendered by the Indians on June 1, 1833. This gave the\r\n     first opportunity for the legal settlement of Iowa by\r\n     citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"June 1, 1833, was fixed as the day on which the Indians\r\n     were to be removed from the Black Hawk Purchase and the\r\n     lands opened for settlement. The would-be settlers came in\r\n     large numbers to the banks of the Mississippi, ready to\r\n     cross and get the choice of the land. United States troops\r\n     kept guard on the western shore of the river and prevented\r\n     any persons from entering the Purchase before the appointed\r\n     time. At precisely twelve o'clock, midnight, June 1st, there\r\n     was a wild rush of settlers from East and South and the\r\n     settlement of Iowa was begun.\r\n\r\n     \"There was a rapid increase in population until the separate\r\n     Territorial government was established, June 12, 1838. The\r\n     first capital was Burlington, and the place of meeting of\r\n     the legislature was in a church. Robert Lucas was appointed\r\n     Territorial Governor, and William B. Conway, Secretary. The\r\n     Territorial Legislature met on November 12, 1838.\r\n     Burlington continued to be the seat of Territorial\r\n     government till 1841, when Iowa City became the capital.\r\n\r\n     \"The Territory of Iowa had a heated dispute with the State\r\n     of Missouri over the boundary line between the two.\r\n     Missouri's northern boundary was the parallel of latitude\r\n     passing through the rapids of the river Des Moines. There\r\n     were two rapids, eight or ten miles apart, and the dispute\r\n     was as to which of these was meant, Missouri insisting upon\r\n     the northern and Iowa on the southern one. Each government\r\n     tried to enforce its authority. In the attempt to do this,\r\n     Governor Boggs, of Missouri, called out the militia; then\r\n     Governor Lucas, of Iowa, called out his soldiers. Five\r\n     hundred men were under arms. On the petitions of Iowa and\r\n     Missouri, Congress authorized a suit to settle the\r\n     controversy, which resulted in a decision favorable to Iowa.\r\n\r\n     \"Further treaties were made with the Indians by which\r\n     additional land was gained for settlement. A large tract of\r\n     land was opened to settlers on May 1, 1843, and on the\r\n     preceding night there was a rush of land seekers similar to\r\n     that which had occurred ten years before; over a thousand\r\n     families settled in the newly opened lands within twelve\r\n     hours.\r\n\r\n     \"The very rapid increase in population led to a demand for\r\n     statehood. On July 31, 1840, the Territorial Legislature\r\n     passed an Act by which it called for a vote of the people on\r\n     the question of assembling a constitutional convention. In\r\n     August the vote was taken, resulting in the defeat of the\r\n     proposition by a vote of two thousand nine hundred and seven\r\n     to nine hundred and thirty-seven. Another vote was taken in\r\n     1842, resulting in the same way, but on February 12, 1844,\r\n     the suggestion of a constitutional convention met the\r\n     approval of the majority of the electors, and without\r\n     waiting for a Federal Enabling Act a Constitution was\r\n     adopted by a convention which met at Iowa City, October 7,\r\n     1844, and finished its work November 1st of the same year.\r\n     This Constitution was submitted to Congress by the\r\n     Territorial delegate.\r\n\r\n     \"Here again there was the effort to balance a northern and\r\n     southern State. Maine had been admitted into the Union in\r\n     1820, and Missouri in 1821; Arkansas in 1836, and Michigan\r\n     in the next year. Now, it was proposed to admit Florida with\r\n     Iowa. At this time Florida was much below the required\r\n     population. The Congressional debate on the subject was a\r\n     long and interesting one and brought out clearly the growing\r\n     jealousy between North and South. This feeling was\r\n     especially strong at this time because of the probability\r\n     that several southern slaveholding States might be formed\r\n     from Texas.\r\n\r\n     \"There was furthermore a dispute of considerable importance\r\n     over the general boundary of Iowa. The Constitution\r\n     submitted to Congress by the Territorial delegate provided\r\n     that the boundary should be as follows: 'Beginning in the\r\n     middle of the main channel of Mississippi River opposite the\r\n     mouth of Des Moines River; thence up the said River Des\r\n     Moines in the middle of the main channel thereof, to a point\r\n     where it is intersected by the old Indian boundary line, or\r\n     line run by John C. Sullivan in the year 1816; thence\r\n     westwardly along said line to the old northwest corner of\r\n     Missouri; thence due west to the middle of the main channel\r\n     of Missouri River; thence up in the middle of the main\r\n     channel of the river last mentioned to the mouth of Sioux or\r\n     Calumet River; thence in a direct line to the middle of the\r\n     main channel of St. Peter's River, where Watonwan River\r\n     (according to Nicollet's map) enters the same; thence down\r\n     the middle of the main channel of said river to the middle\r\n     to the main channel of Mississippi River; thence down the\r\n     middle of the main channel of said river to the place of\r\n     beginning.'\r\n\r\n     \"An amendment was proposed in Congress which substituted the\r\n     following in place of the boundary as given above:\r\n     'Beginning in the middle of St. Peter's River, at the\r\n     junction of Watonwan or Blue Earth River; with the said\r\n     River St. Peter's running thence due east to the boundary\r\n     line of the Territory of Wisconsin in the middle of\r\n     Mississippi River; thence down the middle of the last-named\r\n     river with the boundary line of the Territory of Wisconsin\r\n     and state of Illinois to the northeast corner of the state\r\n     of Missouri in the said River Mississippi; thence westwardly\r\n     with the boundary line of said State of Missouri to a point\r\n     due south from the place of beginning; thence due north to\r\n     the place of beginning in said St. Peter's River.'\r\n\r\n     \"Of especial interest was the attitude taken by Samuel F.\r\n     Vinton, representative from Ohio, in regard to the admission\r\n     of Iowa. He believed that the Western States should be small\r\n     in area in order that the West might not be deprived of its\r\n     share in the government of the nation. It seemed to him that\r\n     the policy so far pursued in the West had been wrong because\r\n     the States were so large that they were sure to contain two\r\n     or three times as large a population as the Atlantic States.\r\n     There was at the time a provision under consideration that\r\n     Florida might be divided, when either East or West Florida\r\n     should contain a population of thirty-five thousand. Vinton\r\n     contended that if Florida was to be divided, there should be\r\n     a provision for dividing Iowa, because it was safer to give\r\n     political power to the West than to the Atlantic States, for\r\n     the West was the great conservative power of the Union. He\r\n     stated that though the spirit of disunion might exist in the\r\n     North and in the South, it could not live in the West,\r\n     because the interests of the West were inseparably connected\r\n     with both, and it would hold the two sections together,\r\n     because it had no prejudice against either North or South\r\n     and, what was of greater importance, the West was a grain\r\n     growing country, and so must look equally to the\r\n     manufacturing North and the cotton growing South for its\r\n     market. Therefore the West must be conservative whether it\r\n     wished to be or not. Vinton believed that instead of five\r\n     there should have been at least twelve States in the old\r\n     Northwest, and that to partly offset this injustice, small\r\n     States should be formed west of the Mississippi. After\r\n     considerable debate in the House, the bill for the admission\r\n     of Iowa passed that body and was transmitted to the Senate,\r\n     which it passed March 3, 1845.\r\n\r\n     \"After a vote for admission, the constitution was submitted\r\n     to the people of Iowa, who made serious objections to it.\r\n     One objection was directed against the small salaries to be\r\n     paid, which, it was feared, would result in getting only\r\n     inferior men for official positions. The restrictions on\r\n     banks and corporations proved an unpopular feature. The\r\n     limitation placed upon the extent of territory claimed by\r\n     Iowa was unsatisfactory to many, though the State would\r\n     still have an area of forty-four thousand three hundred\r\n     square miles. This reduction of area was the greatest\r\n     objection, so that when the vote was taken many who were in\r\n     favor of statehood voted against forming a state of such\r\n     reduced area, and the Constitution was rejected by a vote of\r\n     seven thousand and nineteen to six thousand and\r\n     twenty-three.\r\n\r\n     \"The governor called a special session of the legislature,\r\n     and a bill for the re-submission of the constitution was\r\n     passed over his veto. This was defeated by the people in\r\n     August, 1845. On January 17, 1846, an Act was passed which\r\n     provided for a new constitutional convention. This body came\r\n     together in May and adopted a new constitution which did not\r\n     differ greatly from the earlier instrument. The boundaries\r\n     given in it were a compromise between those originally asked\r\n     by the people and those granted by Congress. The matter was\r\n     actively discussed in Congress when the new constitution\r\n     with the changed boundaries came before that body, but the\r\n     arguments were essentially the same as those previously\r\n     advanced. An exciting campaign followed in Iowa, and the\r\n     constitution was adopted, August 3, 1846, by a small\r\n     majority. On the 4th of August the president signed the bill\r\n     which settled the boundary question in accordance with the\r\n     second constitution, and an Act was passed December 28,\r\n     1846, by which Iowa was admitted into the Union.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY LAND DEED FROM THE U. S. GOVERNMENT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_Iowa and Her People_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In all that is good Iowa affords the best.\"\r\n\r\nThus a few years ago wrote one of our state's most distinguished\r\ncitizens.[C]\r\n\r\nAnd his utterance found a ready response in the hearts of the men and\r\nwomen of our fair land, so that today the expression is an axiom. Every\r\nIowan believes firmly in its truth.\r\n\r\nThere is no fairer land under the benevolent sun. Here plenty reigns,\r\nand prosperity has her home. Cheerful industry has redeemed the land\r\nthat once was the home of wild animals and untamed savages. Iowa's\r\nwaving corn fields; her meadows of luxuriant grass; her hills dotted\r\nwith magnificent houses and barns; her landscape made more picturesque\r\nby the presence of fattening herds; her school houses and higher\r\ncenters of learning on almost every hill; the smoke from the busy\r\nindustries of her thriving cities and villages; her soil the most\r\nfertile of any known; her waste land less than that of any other equal\r\narea; her percentage of illiteracy the lowest; her mineral resources\r\nabundant; her numerous streams affording water power inferior to\r\nnone--all these things and more rightly tend to make Iowans proud of\r\ntheir State.\r\n\r\nNow, as a half century ago, Iowa offers \"to the lawloving and the\r\ntemperate; to the enterprising, the vigorous, the ambitious, a home and\r\na field worthy of their noblest efforts.\"[D] She throws open to the\r\nworld her exhaustless stores of wealth, her golden opportunities, and\r\nsays: \"Behold your reward.\"\r\n\r\nN. H. Parker, writing more than a half century ago, drew this glowing\r\npicture of the future Iowa:\r\n\r\n     \"As the immigrant mother leads her sons and daughters into\r\n     the undeveloped paths of wealth--as civilization elevates a\r\n     race out of the sloughs of semi-barbarism--as national\r\n     prosperity exalts a land--or as science raises the human\r\n     intellect from darkness into dazzling light--thus Iowa, with\r\n     rapid strides, ascends the precipitious sides of\r\n     prosperity's mountain range, bearing her sons and daughters\r\n     to loftier, and still loftier peaks, and revealing to their\r\n     gaze still wider and richer vistas. And the summit of this\r\n     range she will never reach; for her onward progress cannot\r\n     be stayed, until her arterial streams are dry--until the\r\n     agricultural life-blood in her veins has ceased to flow,\r\n     until her great metallic heart has been emptied. Upon the\r\n     topmost summit, then, Iowa will never stand, for through\r\n     countless ages yet to come, her progress--that must be\r\n     forever onward--must be upward also.\"[E]\r\n\r\nThe people of Iowa do not stand still. Not satisfied with present\r\nachievements, they go forward, doing well to-day the tasks that\r\nare theirs, and striving earnestly to make the future better and\r\nmore glorious than the past.\r\n\r\nWe can not do better here than by quoting a toast to the future of Iowa\r\ngiven some years ago by O. J. Laylander, a loyal son of the state:\r\n\r\n     \"In the few minutes allotted to this toast scant justice may\r\n     be awarded so worthy a theme. We love you, O Iowa, lusty\r\n     child, resting in the mighty arms of the Missouri and the\r\n     Father of Waters, laughing beneath the warm kisses and the\r\n     love tears of gentle May; crying aloud to all the world:\r\n     'See how I grow! How strong I am! How happy and healthy and\r\n     beautiful!'\r\n\r\n     \"Iowa is glorious now. The great, green carpets, fresh from\r\n     the springtime cleaning, shimmer in the glorious sun. The\r\n     broad, black belts of loam await with open pockets the\r\n     hiding of the golden grain. Living, glowing mines of gold\r\n     stud the prairies' endless velvet folds. The countless\r\n     castles of the farm are bound into great bundles by the\r\n     sounding wire. Above every door that opens upon honest toil\r\n     is inscribed in letters of gold the motto, 'Rich, rich,\r\n     rich.'\r\n\r\n     \"Such is Iowa today in its wealth of land and stock. Each\r\n     year the unfailing field fills the bins to bursting and\r\n     grows the meat for millions.\r\n\r\n     \"Material Iowa, with great leaps, has gone forward in the\r\n     world's race. Manifest destiny was misread by even the\r\n     wisest of our grandfathers. Even thirty years ago no prophet\r\n     dared choose the gorgeous hues necessary to a true picture\r\n     of the Iowa of to-day.\r\n\r\n     \"Yet not alone in industrial lines has Iowa set the pace for\r\n     the states. In politics she has crowded New England off the\r\n     stage, and bold Ohio sits quietly at her feet. In literature\r\n     and in arts she stands unashamed. Comfort and culture walk\r\n     hand in hand, and happiness is a perennial contagion.\r\n\r\n     \"Some fifty years ago there came to Iowa a sturdy boy. Today\r\n     he calls his own one thousand billowy acres which have risen\r\n     in value in steps of ten until one hundred thousand dollars\r\n     would not tempt him to yield his title. One June afternoon\r\n     he sat on his piazza in sweet reverie. He reviewed the\r\n     wonderful development of the grand old state, and sent his\r\n     imagination in search of greater possibilities. From the\r\n     hedge the thrush poured forth a song of love. The humming\r\n     bees thrust their honeyed tongues into the flowers on the\r\n     trellis at his side. The south wind was heavy with fragrance\r\n     brushed from the blooming bushes. All nature conspired to\r\n     steal the old man's senses and soon reverie gave way to\r\n     sleep and dreams, and this, they say, was the dream: He\r\n     dreamed that it was the year nineteen hundred and forty-one,\r\n     and he was celebrating his hundredth birthday. He had seen\r\n     comfort and culture become as common as the summer sun.\r\n     Literature and art had countless country devotees. People\r\n     had ceased to hurry, and worry was unknown: and then he\r\n     dreamed that he died, and sought admission at the golden\r\n     gate. To his amazement he was halted and informed that he\r\n     was at the wrong place. Greatly grieved, he parleyed with\r\n     the guard: 'I never wittingly did a human soul a wrong. I\r\n     was rich, but it was not my fault. Why must I, who have\r\n     always tried to do my duty, go to hell?' 'No one said\r\n     anything about hell,' was the reply. 'To the annex--the\r\n     second gate to the right. You Iowa people complain so much\r\n     about celestial conditions and make so many comparisons with\r\n     Iowa that we have concluded to colonize you a few thousand\r\n     years and send you all back to Iowa.'\r\n\r\n     \"That the future of Iowa shall be such that if you shall not\r\n     wish to come back, you shall at least wish to stay as long\r\n     as possible, is my sincere desire.\"[F]\r\n\r\nCalhoun made the assertion on the floor of the United States Senate\r\nthat he had been told that \"the Iowa country has been seized upon by a\r\nlawless body of armed men.\" Senator Ewing, of Ohio, and Senator Clay,\r\nof Kentucky, had received similar information, the former asserting\r\nthat he would in no way object to giving each rascal who crossed the\r\nMississippi to the westward one thousand dollars if by that means he\r\nmight get rid of him. And these distinguished statesmen were not alone\r\nin this view. To many in the east the first comers to the territory\r\nwere \"land robbers,\" \"idle and profligate characters,\" \"fugitives from\r\njustice,\" \"lawless intruders,\" and worse. They were squatters \"who\r\nfeared neither the laws of God nor man.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless those who made these assertions were honest and sincere. They\r\nbelieved that only the most desperate characters, the outcasts of\r\ndecent communities, had the hardihood to explore this _terra\r\nincognita_. They could not comprehend how persons living in settled\r\ncommunities, and surrounded with many of the comforts of life, could be\r\nso fool-hardy as to leave all these things for the sake of making a new\r\nhome in a wilderness inhabited only by wild animals and wilder and more\r\ndangerous Indians.\r\n\r\nBut there is another side to the picture. Personal observation is\r\nalways more to be depended upon than hearsay testimony. One of the most\r\ntrust-worthy of the early writers on Iowa is Lieut. Albert Miller Lea.\r\nHe had spent some years in the \"Ioway District\"; he had made a tour of\r\nobservation across the state; he had most excellent opportunities for\r\nobserving and studying the character of our first settlers. His\r\ntestimony cannot be impeached, for he was a man far above the practice\r\nof deceit. In his _Notes on the Wisconsin Territory_, particularly with\r\nreference to the Iowa District or Black Hawk Purchase, published in\r\n1836, he gives this vivid and truthful picture of our early\r\ninhabitants:\r\n\r\n     \"The character of this population is such as is rarely to be\r\n     found in our newly acquired territories. With very few\r\n     exceptions, there is not a more orderly, industrious,\r\n     active, pains-taking population west of the Alleghenies,\r\n     than is this of the Iowa District. Those who have been\r\n     accustomed to associate the name of _Squatter_ with the idea\r\n     of idleness and recklessness, would be quite surprised to\r\n     see the systematic manner in which every thing is here\r\n     conducted. For intelligence, I boldly assert that they are\r\n     not surpassed, as a body, by an equal number of citizens of\r\n     any country in the world.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a matter of surprise that, about the Mining Region,\r\n     there should be so little of the recklessness that is usual\r\n     in that sort of life.... This regularity and propriety is to\r\n     be attributed to the preponderance of well informed and\r\n     well-intentioned gentlemen among them, as well as to the\r\n     disposition of the mass of the people.\"[G]\r\n\r\nTwo years later another personal observer says: \"He who supposes that\r\nsettlers ... who are now building upon, fencing and cultivating the\r\nlands of the government are lawless depredators, devoid of the sense of\r\nmoral honesty, or that they are not in every sense as estimable\r\ncitizens, with as much intelligence, regard for law and social order,\r\nfor public justice and private rights ... as the farmers and yeomen of\r\nNew York and Pennsylvania ... has been led astray by vague and\r\nunfounded notions, or by positively false information.\"[H]\r\n\r\nThese people knew the pioneers, and their testimony is entitled to\r\ncredence. As a class even the \"Squatters\" were not idle, or vicious, or\r\nignorant. They were young men, strong and hardy, full of courage and\r\nadventure. \"There was not a better population on the face of the\r\nearth,\" is the testimony of Senator Benton. \"They made roads,\" says\r\nProf. B. F. Shambaugh, superintendent of the Iowa State Historical\r\nSociety, \"built bridges and mills, cleared the forests, broke the\r\nprairies, erected houses and barns, and defended the settled country\r\nagainst hostile Indians. They were distinguished especially for their\r\ngeneral intelligence, their hospitality, their independence and bold\r\nenterprise. They had schools and school houses, erected churches, and\r\nobserved the Sabbath.... The pioneers were religious, but not\r\necclesiastical. They lived in the open and looked upon the relations of\r\nman to nature with an open mind. To be sure their thoughts were more on\r\n'getting along' in this world than upon the 'immortal crown' of the\r\nPuritan. And yet in the silent forest, in the broad prairie, in the\r\ndeep blue sky, in the sentinels of the night, in the sunshine and in\r\nthe storm, in the rosy dawn, in the golden sunset, and in the daily\r\ntrials and battles of frontier life, they too must have seen and felt\r\nthe Infinite.\"[I]\r\n\r\nNo greater tribute has ever been paid to the pioneers of our state than\r\nthat given by a distinguished native of the state, Hon. Robert G.\r\nCousins, on Iowa Day at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha on\r\nSept. 21, 1898. The following extracts from that masterly oration are\r\nworthy of preservation here:\r\n\r\n     \"I have asked five of the ablest and most noted Americans\r\n     what they regard as the chief thing or leading feature of\r\n     the Trans-Mississippi region and they have invariably\r\n     answered, 'Its men and women.' The other day I met one of\r\n     the oldest settlers of eastern Iowa--one of those original,\r\n     rugged characters whose wit and wisdom have lightened the\r\n     settlers' hearts and homes for many a toilsome year--one of\r\n     those interesting characters who never bores you and whom\r\n     one always likes to meet--a man whose head is silvered and\r\n     whose countenance is kind--and I asked him what he regarded\r\n     as the principal feature of our Trans-Mississippi country,\r\n     and he replied: 'Well, I'm no scholar, but I've been round\r\n     here nigh onto sixty years and I reckon 'bout the most\r\n     important thing is the folks and the farms.'\r\n\r\n     \"Iowa became a separate territory, with the capital at\r\n     Burlington, in 1838, and was admitted into the Union in\r\n     1846, and has been in it ever since. It makes little\r\n     difference whether it was first settled by the whites at\r\n     Dubuque for mining purposes in 1788, or, for trading\r\n     purposes, at Montrose, in 1799, or opposite Prairie du\r\n     Chien, in 1804 or 5, or in Lee county at Sandusky in 1820,\r\n     or on the lower rapids at what is now known as Nashville, in\r\n     1829; or whether the first settlements for general purposes\r\n     were made at Burlington and Davenport in 1832. The main fact\r\n     is that it was well settled--not by dyspeptic tourists nor\r\n     by invalids who had come west out of curiosity and New\r\n     Jersey, nor by climate seeking dilettanti with two servants\r\n     and one lung--but by the best bone and sinew of the middle\r\n     states, New England and the old world. I do not know that\r\n     there were any dukes or lords or marquises or duchesses, but\r\n     there were Dutch and Irish and Scotch and Scotch-Irish and\r\n     English and Americans, and they had home rule right from the\r\n     start--at least they had it in the first school which I\r\n     attended. The men and women who settled the Hawkeye state\r\n     were not those who expected to go back 'in the fall,' or as\r\n     soon as they could prove up on their claims. They were\r\n     stayers. They were not men to be discouraged by winter or by\r\n     work. They were men who knew that nobody ever amounted to\r\n     much in this world unless he had to. Most of them began\r\n     simply with the capital of honesty, good health and their\r\n     inherent qualities of character. They built their cabins in\r\n     the clearings and, watching the smoke curl up in the great,\r\n     wide sky, felt just as patriotic for their humble rustic\r\n     homes as e'er did princes for their castles or millionaires\r\n     for mansions grand.\r\n\r\n     \"To build a home is a great thing. It doesn't matter so much\r\n     about the dimensions. 'Kings have lived in cottages and\r\n     pygmies dwelt in palaces,' but the walls of a home always\r\n     add something to inherent character. In the formation of\r\n     character there are always two elements, the inherent and\r\n     the adventitious--that which we bring with us into the world\r\n     and that which our surroundings give us. Somebody said\r\n     'there is only a small portion of the earth that produces\r\n     splendid people.' Our pioneers got into a good place. They\r\n     had left doubt sitting on a boulder in the east and packed\r\n     their things and started for the west. Rivers had to be\r\n     forded, trees to be felled, cabins had to be built--the\r\n     rifle must be kept loaded--so much the better, there was\r\n     self-reliance. Corn and coffee had to be ground, and on the\r\n     same mill--so much the better, there was ingenuity. Teeth\r\n     had to be filled, and there was no painless dentistry.\r\n     Disease and injury must be dealt with, and the doctor fifty\r\n     miles away. Life must be lightened, lonely hearts must be\r\n     cheered, and the old friends and comrades far back in the\r\n     states or maybe away in fatherland, and the cheering letter\r\n     tarrying with the belated stage coach--hold fast, thou\r\n     sturdy denizen and gentle helpmate of the rich and wondrous\r\n     empire, infinite goodness guards thee and the fertile fields\r\n     are ready to reward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEPHERD'S TAVERN Erected in 1838, Looking West.

COURTESY\r\nCARROLL'S HISTORY]\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, pampered people of the later generations, when you\r\n     imagine modern hardships, think of the courage and the\r\n     trials and the ingenuity of pioneers when there were no\r\n     conveniences but the forest and the axe, the wide rolling\r\n     prairie and the ox team, the great blue sky, the unsolved\r\n     future and the annual ague! Complain of markets in these\r\n     modern times and then think of your grandmother when she was\r\n     a blooming bride, listening through the toilsome days and\r\n     anxious nights for the wagon bringing home the husband from\r\n     a distant market with calico and jeans purchased with\r\n     dressed pork sold at a dollar and a half a hundred, and\r\n     maybe bringing home a little money, worth far less per yard\r\n     than either calico or jeans. Maybe it is all for the best,\r\n     human character was being formed for the development of a\r\n     great and loyal and progressive state to shine forever among\r\n     the stars of the federal union....\r\n\r\n     \"Civil government in Iowa proceeded with its rapid\r\n     settlement. The pioneer became a model citizen. He knew the\r\n     necessity for the laws that were enacted. He did not feel\r\n     oppressed by government. He had experienced the losses of\r\n     robbery and larceny and knew something of the embarrassment\r\n     and inconvenience of being scalped. There was no hysteria\r\n     about trusts and combines because they had practiced\r\n     combinations themselves for mutual protection. If any one\r\n     would learn the true genius and exemplification and\r\n     philosophy of self-government, government of and for and by\r\n     the people, let him study the records of pioneer life, the\r\n     institutional beginnings, and the evolution of their laws.\r\n     It would be worth our while on some suitable occasion when\r\n     time permitted to talk over the interesting incidents\r\n     attending the administration of justice in the early days of\r\n     Iowa, the incidents of its territorial legislatures, the\r\n     birth and growth of its statehood and the character of its\r\n     officials. But the greatness of our state is not contained\r\n     in any name. Its official history is the exponent of its\r\n     industrial life and character. Its greatness is the sum\r\n     total of its citizenship. In order to be just, John Jones,\r\n     the average citizen, must be mentioned along with our most\r\n     illustrious officials. Somebody said that the history of a\r\n     nation is the history of its great men, but there is an\r\n     unwritten history which that averment overlooks. The growth\r\n     of a state is the progress of its average citizen. The\r\n     credit of a commonwealth is the thrift of its John Jones and\r\n     its William Smith, and the character, prosperity and\r\n     patriotism of the individual citizen is the history of Iowa.\r\n\r\n     \"The population of 97,000 which she had when admitted into\r\n     the union had increased to 754,699 at the close of the Civil\r\n     war. Of these about 70,000, almost one-tenth of the\r\n     population, were in the war--a number equal to nearly\r\n     one-half of the voters of the state. Who made the history of\r\n     Iowa during that great struggle of our nation's life? John\r\n     Jones, the average citizen, whether he carried a musket\r\n     helping to put the scattered stars of state back into the\r\n     constellation of the Union, or whether he toiled from early\r\n     dawn to lingering twilight in the fields or in the shop. The\r\n     best civilization is that which maintains the highest\r\n     standard of life for its average citizen.\r\n\r\n     \"Since the Civil war the state of Iowa has increased in\r\n     population to almost 2,225,000 of people, and most of the\r\n     time has had the least illiteracy of any state in the Union.\r\n     Doubtless for that we are indebted to many of the older\r\n     states, whose enterprising and courageous citizens\r\n     constitute so large a portion of our population. With but a\r\n     century of statehood and with an area of but 55,475 square\r\n     miles, the state of Iowa produces the greatest quantity of\r\n     cereals of any state in the Union. As long ago as the last\r\n     federal census, taken in 1890, it produced more corn, more\r\n     oats, more beef, more pork than any state in the Union. Not\r\n     long since I was introduced to a gentleman from New York\r\n     city. He said, 'Oh, from Iowa--ah--let me see, that's\r\n     out--ah--you see, I'm not very well posted on the geography\r\n     of the west.' 'Yes,' I said, 'it's out there just across the\r\n     Mississippi river. You can leave New York about noon and get\r\n     your supper in Iowa the next evening. It might be worth your\r\n     while to look it up. It's the state which produces more of\r\n     the things which people eat than any other state in the\r\n     Union. It has more miles of railroads than your state of New\r\n     York, more than Mexico, more than Brazil and more than all\r\n     the New England states combined.'\r\n\r\n     \"The value of Iowa's agricultural products and live stock in\r\n     round numbers for the year 1892 was $407,000,000, to say\r\n     nothing of her other great and various industries and\r\n     enterprises. She produced that year 160,000,000 pounds of\r\n     the best butter on earth of the value of $32,000,000. The\r\n     Hawkeye butter ladle has achieved a cunning that challenges\r\n     all Columbia. The Iowa cow has slowly and painfully yet\r\n     gradually and grandly worked her way upward to a shining\r\n     eminence in the eyes of the world. The state of Iowa has on\r\n     her soil today, if nothing ill befalls it, ninety million\r\n     dollars' worth of corn. The permanent value of land is\r\n     estimated by its corn-producing qualities. Of all the\r\n     products of the earth, corn is king and it reigns in Iowa.\r\n\r\n     \"Industry and nature have made the state of Iowa a creditor.\r\n     Her soil has always been solvent and her system of farming\r\n     does not tend to pauperize. She is a constant seller and\r\n     therefore wants the evidence of the transaction to be\r\n     unimpeachable. She has more school teachers than any other\r\n     state except the Empire state and only three and six-tenths\r\n     per cent of her population are illiterates. The state of\r\n     Iowa has yielded the greatest dividends on her educational\r\n     investments. She has become illustrious on account of her\r\n     enlightenment. She has progressed further from 'primitive\r\n     indifferent tissue' than the land even of Darwin himself,\r\n     and in her escape from protoplasm and prejudice she is\r\n     practically out of danger. Marked out in the beginning by\r\n     the hand of God, bounded on the east and west by the two\r\n     great rivers of the continent, purified and stimulated by\r\n     the snows of winter, blessed with copious rainfall in the\r\n     growing season, with generous soil and stately forests\r\n     interspersed, no wonder that the dusky aborigines exclaimed\r\n     when they crossed the Father of Waters, 'Iowa, this is the\r\n     place!' Not only did the red men give our state its\r\n     beautiful and poetic name, but Indian nomenclature runs like\r\n     a romance throughout the counties and communities. What\r\n     infinite meaning, what tokens of joy and sadness, of triumph\r\n     and of tears, of valor and of vanquishment, of life and love\r\n     and song there may be in these weird, strange words that\r\n     name to-day so many of our towns and streams and counties:\r\n     Allamakee, Chickasaw, Dakota City, Sioux, Pocahontas,\r\n     Winneshiek, Keosauqua, Sac, Winnebago, Tama, Nodawa,\r\n     Competine, Chariton, Comanche, Cherokee, Waukon,\r\n     Muchakinock, Washta, Monona, Waupeton, Onawa, Keota,\r\n     Waudina, Ioka, Ottumwa, Oneska, Waukee, Waucoma,\r\n     Nishnabotna, Keokuk, Decorah, Wapello, Muscatine, Maquoketa,\r\n     Mahaska, Ocheyedan, Mississippi, Appanoose, Missouri,\r\n     Quasqueton, Anamosa, Poweshiek, Pottawattamie, Osceola,\r\n     Oskaloosa, Wapsipinicon.\r\n\r\n     \"Ere long some westland genius, moved by the mystic\r\n     inspiration of the rich and wondrous heritage of Iowa\r\n     nativity, may sing the song of our legends and traditions,\r\n     may voice in verse the wondrous story of his illustrious\r\n     state. Maybe somewhere among the humble homes where blood\r\n     and bone and brain grow pure and strong, where simple food\r\n     with frugal ways feeds wondering minds and drives them\r\n     craving into nature's secrets and her songs--somewhere along\r\n     the settler's pathway or by the Indian trail where now the\r\n     country churchyards grown with uncut grasses hide the forms\r\n     of sturdy ancestors sleeping all in peaceful ignorance of\r\n     wayward sons or wondrous progeny--somewhere where rising sun\r\n     beholds the peasantry at early toil and leaves them in the\r\n     mystic twilight ere their tasks are done, where odors of the\r\n     corn and new-mown hay and vine-clad hedges by the shadowy\r\n     roadside linger long into the night-time, as a sweet and\r\n     sacred balm for tired hearts--somewhere, sometime the song\r\n     of Iowa shall rise and live, and it will not omit the\r\n     thought of that gifted son who said: 'Iowa, the affections\r\n     of her people, like the rivers of her borders, flow to an\r\n     inseparable union.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_The Geology of Linn County_\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM HARMON NORTON, PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY IN CORNELL COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that a certain county in Kentucky, underlain by limestone,\r\nalways goes democratic; while a county adjacent, underlain by\r\nsandstone, is as invariably republican. Certain it is that a deal of\r\npolitics, economics, and history depends at last analysis more or less\r\nupon the processes past and present which belong to geology and\r\nphysiography. The rocks, the minerals they contain, and the water they\r\nstore, the hills and valleys into which they have been carved, and the\r\nsoils to which they weather, largely control the industries, locate the\r\ncities, and outcrop even in the social, intellectual, and moral life of\r\nthe people. The metropolis of Linn county, for example, owes its name\r\nand place to the rapids of the Cedar, and the rapids find ultimate\r\ncause in the fact that some millions of years ago nature stopped laying\r\na softer rock upon the ocean bed and deposited upon it one of more\r\nresistant texture. In the eastern part of the county the Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern Railway runs for very good and sufficient reasons where\r\nonce rested the edge of a long tongue of glacial ice, and west of Cedar\r\nRapids its route is determined by the course taken by the turbid floods\r\nissuing from the melting glaciers. The streets of Mount Vernon and\r\nseveral of the main highways of the county do not lie with the points\r\nof the compass but follow the direction of flow of ancient ice-streams.\r\nThe distribution of forest and prairie is due to geologic causes. The\r\nvalues of farm lands are markedly affected by the same influences, and\r\nwe can even point out a little area which differs from its surroundings\r\nin its inhabitants and in their literacy, language, architecture,\r\nmanners, and morals, primarily because it belongs to what geologists\r\nclassify as the deeply dissected loess-covered Kansan drift sheet.\r\n\r\nThe inductive history of Linn county, reasoned out from what we have\r\nlearned of the lie of the land, the shapes of hills and valleys, the\r\nsoils and subsoils, and the underlying rocks, is a wonderfully long\r\none. The first chapter that has been opened to inspection in the\r\ngeologic record of our area is that of the deepest rocks probed by the\r\nfirst deep well drilled at Cedar Rapids. At a depth of 2,150 feet from\r\nthe surface--1,417 feet below the level of the sea--the drill\r\nencountered a hard red siliceous rock which may be taken as the\r\nequivalent of the _Sioux Quartzite_, which comes to the surface at\r\nSioux Falls, South Dakota, and at Baraboo, Wisconsin. This well known\r\nbuilding stone is used in a number of the business blocks and private\r\nresidences of Cedar Rapids, as for example in the old office building\r\nof the _Republican_. Belonging to the Algonkian, an era so remote that\r\nits age must be reckoned in scores if not in hundreds of millions of\r\nyears, the quartzite at the bottom of the deep well tells of time\r\ninconceivably remote when Linn county was part of a wide sea floor on\r\nwhich red sands were washed to and fro and finally laid to rest in\r\nthick deposits of sandstone. Tilted and folded and hardened by\r\npressure, the Algonkian rocks were uplifted from the sea to form dry\r\nland of mountainous heights. After the lapse of ages the old land sunk\r\nbeneath the sea, and again and again with intervals of uplift and\r\nsubaerial erosion there were laid upon it sea muds, impure limestones,\r\nand thick sandstones during a long succession of geologic aeons.\r\nSamples of these deposits can be seen in the well drillings preserved\r\nin the Y. M. C. A. at Cedar Rapids and in the collections of Cornell\r\nCollege. For many millions of years Linn county was thus sometimes land\r\nand sometimes sea, but neither land nor sea was tenanted by aught but\r\nthe humblest of living creatures. These ancient deposits concern us\r\nbecause they are the aqueducts by which artesian waters of purest\r\nquality are brought to our doors from their sources far to the\r\nnorthward in other states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDEPENDENCE SHALES on C., R. I. & P. Ry. below Cedar\r\nRapids]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLUFF AT KENWOOD PARK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPOSURE OF BRECCIATED LIMESTONE IN MILWAUKEE CUT AT\r\nLINN JUNCTION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE BLOW OUT,\" PALISADES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FIRST SETTLER, NEAR MT. VERNON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALISADES]\r\n\r\nThe most recent of the formations which are pierced by the drill, but\r\nwhich do not come to the surface within the limits of the county, is\r\nthe _Maquoketa shale_, reached in the eastern townships at a depth of\r\nsomewhat more than 300 feet. This impervious bed of altered clay stops\r\nthe descent of ground water, which thus is stored in large quantities\r\nin the overlying limestones and supplies some of the important wells of\r\nthe county such as that of the town of Mount Vernon. At the time when\r\nthese sea clays were laid, eastern Iowa was under sea, but so near was\r\nthe low lying land to the north and east that vast quantities of mud\r\nwere brought in by its rivers forming deposits nearly 300 feet in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SILURIAN\r\n\r\nWith the lapse of ages physical conditions changed and Linn County was\r\ncovered with a warm shallow coral sea in which were laid the massive\r\nlimestones which now form the country rock in the eastern tier of\r\ntownships. In some of the quarries one may see the ripple marks into\r\nwhich these coral sands were heaped by the pulse of the waves, and one\r\nmay pick out of the rocks casts and moulds of ancient sea shells,\r\ncorals, and trilobites, which formed the highest forms of life then\r\ntenanting the Iowa seas.\r\n\r\nThe lowest beds of the Silurian belong to the _Hopkinton stage_, and\r\nare exposed along the Buffalo. At Hill's mill and at Nugent's quarries\r\nsome layers are crowded with a characteristic fossil--a plump bivalve\r\nshell as large as a walnut, which goes by the name of _Pentamerus\r\nOblongus_. The _Gower_ stage of the Silurian rests upon the Hopkinton\r\nand embraces two types of rocks distinct in their appearance and uses.\r\nThe _LeClaire phase_ of the Gower is a hard, brittle, crystalline,\r\nmagnesian limestone, or dolomite. Normally blue-gray in color, it is\r\noften oxidised to buff. It is well exposed at Viola and on the Cedar\r\nriver from the Cedar County line to a mile or so beyond the Upper\r\nPalisades, southwest of Bertram. The LeClaire forms mounds in places\r\nreaching fifty and even eighty or ninety feet in height in which little\r\nsemblance of bedding structures are to be seen. Here and there the rock\r\nis conglomeratic, consisting of rounded masses of the rock cemented by\r\na less resistent matrix. The cavernous recess in the rock wall of the\r\nPalisades, misnamed the Blowout, is due to the solution of the weaker\r\nmatrix and the dislodgement of the rounded masses. The rock may consist\r\nalso of angular broken blue-gray fragments in the matrix of a buff and\r\nfriable limestone sand. Again, the mounds, at least in part, may be\r\nmade up of massive limestone with little trace of structure of any\r\nsort. On the sides of the mounds and merging into the conglomeratic or\r\nother structures the rock of the LeClaire often is stratified and the\r\nlayers dip outward at angles surprisingly high. In places these tilted\r\nlayers may show sharp folds. The rock of all structures is\r\nfossiliferous. Even the broken fragments of breccia are porous with\r\nmoulds of minute fossils which have been removed by solution. The\r\nmassive rock is largely made up in places of stems of crinoids--stone\r\nlilies which grew in the greatest profusion in these quiet waters--and\r\nthe tilted layers may be made of casts and moulds of unbroken shells of\r\nlittle bivalves. Occasionally the saucer shaped tail and head-shields\r\nof a characteristic trilobite are found piled together and unbroken.\r\nCoral are very common in this ancient reef rock, a form resembling\r\nhoneycomb being especially noticeable. And as one floats down stream\r\nat the base of the cliffs he can hardly fail to notice large tapering\r\nsegmented shells, either straight or slightly curved, representatives\r\nof the cephalopod mollusks.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque rock walls of the Palisades, which rise perpendicular\r\nfor as much as ninety feet from the water's edge, are due primarily to\r\nthe great resistance of the LeClaire rock, due to its chemical\r\ncomposition--for dolomite weathers far less rapidly than a\r\nnon-magnesian limestone--and to the fewness of those planes of weakness\r\ncalled joint-planes. The joints of the LeClaire are distant and\r\nvertical. The stone breaks down, therefore, in immense blocks where\r\nundercut by the river which leave for ages the scarp behind them as a\r\nvertical wall.\r\n\r\nBecause of its qualities the LeClaire is one of the best lime rocks in\r\nthe country. The impurities of the clay, the iron and silica which it\r\ncontains, may run as low as one-third of one per cent. The large per\r\ncent of carbonate of magnesia present makes it a cool lime, slow to\r\nslack and slow to set, and it is to such limes that architects, masons,\r\nand plasterers now invariably give preference over the so-called hot\r\nlimes burned from non-magnesian limestones. The hardness and durability\r\nof mortars made from the LeClaire rock limes approaches that of cement,\r\nand after thirty-five or forty years of weathering, joints in mason\r\nwork seem almost as fresh as when first struck.\r\n\r\nThe extreme hardness of the rock and the slowness with which it\r\nweathers make it specially valuable for crushing for macadam and\r\nballast.\r\n\r\nThe _Anamosa phase_ of the Gower limestone is typically exposed in the\r\nlarge quarries at Anamosa and Stone City, Mount Vernon and Waubeek. It\r\nis a light buff or yellow limestone, with constant, parallel, and\r\nhorizontal or gently inclined laminated layers. The limestone is soft\r\nto work but hardens on exposure. The saw encounters no obdurate\r\nmaterials and the chisel finds the fracture even and regular. Bedding\r\nplanes are so even and smooth as to be at once ready for the mortar\r\nwith little or no dressing. Much of the stone can be split horizontally\r\nto any desired thickness, while the distant joints permit the quarrying\r\nof blocks beyond the facilities of transportation or any possible use.\r\nMany layers are so homogenous that they can be wrought into fine\r\ncarvings.\r\n\r\nAs a dolomite the stone is far more resistant than a purer limestone.\r\nIn the Mount Vernon cemetery tombstones of this material, whose dates\r\nrun back to the forties and early fifties, have been so little affected\r\nby superficial decay that the tool marks are almost as fresh as when\r\nthe chisel left them; while marbles of half their age have broken down\r\ninto ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian rocks of the county measure about 300 feet in thickness.\r\nThey are confined pretty closely to the townships of the eastern tier,\r\nbut extend beyond their limits up the valleys of the Cedar and\r\nWapsipinicon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BERTRAM LIMESTONE\r\n\r\nAs the Silurian limestones sink below the surface because of the\r\nwestward dip, they are succeeded by a bed of rock, named from its\r\noutcrop at Bertram, and found along Big Creek as far north as Paralta\r\nand Springville. This is a heavily bedded gray rock which weathers\r\nalmost white. At a number of places along Big Creek it forms\r\npicturesque cliffs, and hillsides covered with huge boulders of\r\ndisintegration. At one point it is seen to overlie the Anamosa beds of\r\nthe Silurian, and several exposures are known where it is succeeded by\r\nthe Otis limestones of the Devonian. But as it contains no fossils, so\r\nfar as is now known, it can not be said to which of the two ages it\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OTIS LIMESTONES\r\n\r\nThe lower beds of the Otis, as exposed at the base of the Otis\r\nquarries, along the Cedar south of Cedar Rapids, at Springville, and at\r\nCoggon, consist of soft magnesian limestones, fossiliferous with many\r\nmoulds of small bivalve shells of Devonian age. These pass upward into\r\ndrab non-magnesian limestones carrying the principal fossil of the\r\nmagnesian beds in considerable numbers. The upper limestones of the\r\nOtis differ within rather wide limits. The most common type is seen at\r\nthe base of the high cliff at Kenwood on the right bank of Indian\r\nCreek--a hard, brittle ringing and thinly laminated limestone. Often it\r\nhas been subjected to strains under which it has broken, and has been\r\nre-cemented with little displacement of the parts. Occasionally it is\r\nbrown, and highly crystalline.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nAt the Kenwood cliff the eight feet of the Otis at the base is\r\nsucceeded by thirty feet of buff shale and clayey limestones--a\r\nformation known as the _Independence_ from its discovery in a shaft\r\nsunk at that city. The Independence is exposed at many points near\r\nCedar Rapids both on Indian Creek and on the Cedar. On the Wapsipinicon\r\nit is well seen at Cedar Bluff (sec. 24 Spring Grove Tp.), at the\r\n\"Wolf's Den\" a mile up valley, and again in the railway cut north of\r\nCoggon. In the long cut of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway\r\nwest of Linn Junction the Independence is seen in one place as a blue\r\nclay shale carrying a number of fossils characteristic of the shaft at\r\nIndependence, but elsewhere the formation is unfossiliferous in the\r\nnatural exposures so far studied.\r\n\r\nWherever found the Independence contains nodules of silica, which may\r\nreach a foot in diameter, and often angular fragments of the same\r\nmaterial which may be as fine as sand. The formation is marked by\r\nirregularities of deposition, channel cutting by drift currents, lenses\r\nof calcerous material, and rapid lateral change in the form and\r\nconstituents of the rock. All of these characteristics point to the\r\ndeposition of this formation in a shallow sea near shore.\r\n\r\nIndeed, some of the beds were apparently laid in marshes such as are\r\nnow found along low ocean shores. Thin seams of coal formed in the\r\nIndependence were once peaty deposits preserved by the presence of\r\nwater from the decay which returns dead vegetable matter to the air. In\r\n1871 such a seam of coal, not exceeding an inch in thickness, was found\r\nat a depth of ninety feet in a well on the farm of Mrs. C. Hemphill,\r\nnear LaFayette. Pieces of the coal were taken to Cedar Rapids and\r\nMarion. A mining company was formed, and without seeking for any expert\r\nadvice from geologist or mining engineer, and without any tests of the\r\nextent and thickness of the seam, a shaft was sunk after the precious\r\nfuel. Water was encountered in such quantities that expensive pumping\r\nmachinery was used, and in all several thousand dollars were wasted in\r\na search which any competent geologist could have told was foredoomed\r\nto failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAVENPORT LIMESTONES\r\n\r\nThe sea over eastern Iowa deepened after the deposition of the\r\nIndependence, for there was now deposited upon its floor limestones in\r\nplace of shales. The lowest of these, known as the _lower Davenport_\r\nbeds, are hard, compact, and of finest grain, and so far as known are\r\nunfossiliferous. The _upper Davenport_ is a tough, gray,\r\nsemi-crystalline limestone which contains an assemblage of fossils of\r\nmany species. Highest of these are the first vertebrates to appear in\r\nIowa so far as our records go. Fishes which swam over our area left to\r\nbe imbedded in the limestones their hard enameled teeth and fin spines.\r\nThe most common of the Devonian fishes was a small shark.\r\n\r\nIn several other counties the lower and the upper Davenport limestones\r\nretain the attitude of their deposition. But everywhere in Linn county\r\nthey have been broken into bits and re-cemented, forming breccia. These\r\nbrittle rocks could hardly give way to such immense stresses without\r\ncausing sharp and violent vibrations to run through the crust of the\r\nearth, and we may therefore list great earthquakes as a part of the\r\nhistory of our area in Devonian times.\r\n\r\nThe best exposure of the breccia beds is that of the cut of the\r\nChicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway west of Linn Junction. The\r\nbrittle lower Davenport has here been broken and rebroken into a mass\r\nof small sharp-edged fragments, while the tough heavily bedded upper\r\nDavenport ledges have been fractured to large blocks, which sliding on\r\neach other have smoothed and grooved their sides. The breccia beds may\r\nbe seen in the upper eleven feet of the Kenwood cliff, at Troy Mills,\r\nand in the cliffs along the Wapsipinicon valley as far down as near to\r\nCentral City.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEDAR VALLEY LIMESTONES\r\n\r\nThe Otis, Independence, and Davenport limestones form a group called\r\nthe Wapsipinicon, from its outcrop along the river of that name in Linn\r\ncounty. The remaining limestones of the Devonian are grouped together\r\nunder the name of the Cedar Valley. These consist of limestones of\r\nvarious types, sometimes crowded with fossils, and sometimes destitute\r\nof any trace of ancient life. They occupy the western townships of the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Cedar Valley stage the sea retreated westward from\r\nour area, and Linn county became dry land. For long ages its rocks were\r\ncovered with rich soils supporting a luxuriant vegetation, probably\r\ntropical in its aspect. We know that running water channelled this\r\nancient land, for when at last in _Pennsylvanian_ (Coal measure) time\r\nthe land sunk slowly beneath the sea, there were deposited in such\r\nchannels clays and sandstones, which perhaps are only remnants of wide\r\nsheets of similar deposits now removed by denudation. A mile and a half\r\nsouth of Marion (southeast quarter of section 12, Rapids township) a\r\nwell twenty-three feet deep penetrated a bed of dark shale which\r\ncarried leaf impressions of a number of ferns characteristic of the\r\nundergrowth of the Carboniferous forests. A third of a mile southeast\r\nof Lisbon, and again about two miles south of the same village, at\r\nBertram at the east end of the railway bridge, and on the old county\r\nroad between Cedar Rapids and Marion, are exposures of sandstone which\r\nin some instances contain fragments of the logs drifted from perhaps\r\ndistant uplands and water-logged and sunk in these ancient sand beds.\r\nThe Bertram outlier contains many rolled coral fragments and worn bits\r\nof shells of the Devonian, included in Carboniferous deposits, much as\r\nthe same fossils may now be found in the river deposits of the present\r\nage in the sand bars of the Cedar.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESOZOIC AND TERTIARY\r\n\r\nFor a succession of geologic ages our county, in common with eastern\r\nIowa, seems to have remained dry land, for no deposits of the sea are\r\nfound upon it. On both sides of the continent mountain ranges of Alpine\r\nheight were uplifted, and during the immeasurable years worn down,\r\ngrain by grain, to flat and featureless plains. But no deformations are\r\nrecorded in our county history and the lands seems to have remained so\r\nlow that little erosion was possible. We are permitted to conceive that\r\nover our savannas in Mesozoic times there roamed monstrous reptiles of\r\nstrange shapes, such as are known to have existed in adjacent states.\r\nIn the later ages of this era it is not impossible that during the\r\ngreat submergence which brought the Cretaceous sea over the Great\r\nPlains from the Arctic to the Gulf, including western Iowa, our area\r\nalso may have been inundated and huge swimming reptiles such as are\r\nfound in the deposits of Kansas and Nebraska may have disported\r\nthemselves where now our rich farm lands lie open to the sun, while in\r\nthe air featherless cold-blooded creatures larger than any bird winged\r\ntheir way on leathery pinions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ASTOR HOUSE Erected by John Young in 1839, Looking\r\nSouth The Second House in Cedar Rapids COURTESY CARROLL'S HISTORY]\r\n\r\nDuring the millions of years which are included in the Tertiary ages\r\nLinn county was undoubtedly dry land. On our grass lands pastured a\r\nsuccession of strange and uncouth mammals evolving into higher and\r\nhigher forms. Among these denizens of the county were probably herds of\r\npig-like creatures, three toed horses little bigger than foxes, and\r\nancestral monkeys swarming in the trees, for such are known to have\r\nexisted in other states. But these chapters in the history of the\r\ncounty can not be written from any local records.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIAL EPOCH\r\n\r\nThe warm climate of Tertiary times changed slowly to one of arctic\r\ncold. The winters lengthened and the summers becoming ever cooler and\r\nyet cooler failed at last to melt the winter snows. Vast sheets of\r\nglacial ice, such as that which shrouds Greenland today, covered much\r\nof the continent. The geologic panorama thus presents our area as\r\nburied beneath one after another of slow-moving glaciers hundreds of\r\nfeet thick. The proofs of their existence are found in almost every\r\ncutting which goes below the soil. Any quarry will show the rock deeply\r\nrotted and pitted by long preglacial decay. Here and there upon its\r\nsurface will be found remnants of the deep red residual clays, the\r\nsubsoils of preglacial times. Upon these clays formed from the decaying\r\nrock rest stony clays in which clay, sand, and stones faceted as only\r\nglacier ice can facet, are mingled pell-mell together, as only glacier\r\nice can mingle. Occasionally is found the unmistakable track of the\r\nglacier left on the underlying rock scraped smooth and marked with\r\nparallel scorings, as at the north end of the cut of the Chicago,\r\nMilwaukee & St. Paul Railway at Linn Junction.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers also brought from ledges of granite and other crystalline\r\nrocks in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Canada the boulders which form a\r\nconspicuous feature in some of our prairie landscapes. These, the\r\n\"first settlers,\" traveled to their destinations far more leisurely\r\nthan any ox carts of the immigrant pioneers; for the glaciers can not\r\nhave moved faster at most than fifty feet a day, and probably at less\r\nthan a tenth that rate, judging by the rates of motion of present\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nThe ice sheets of the glacial epoch plastered the county thick with the\r\nstony clays which they dragged along in their basal layers. The\r\nthickness of these glacial deposits probably averages from fifty to one\r\nhundred feet. Old valleys cut in rock by Tertiary rivers were buried\r\nwholly from view, as, for example, one extending north from\r\nPrairieburg; and the farmer now plows his corn in fields which lie two\r\nand three hundred feet above the channels of ancient rivers. In places\r\nthe old valleys were left to be re-occupied by the rivers. Such are the\r\nreaches of wide valley of the Cedar south of Center Point. In other\r\nplaces the rivers were diverted wholly from their ancient beds and made\r\nto flow in new channels which they have not yet had time to widen and\r\ndeepen to their ancient measures. Such are the narrow rock bound\r\nvalleys of the Wapsipinicon south of Troy Mills and of the Cedar at the\r\nPalisades.\r\n\r\nOn the final retreat of the glaciers waters from the melting ice swept\r\nover the county, leaving deposits of sand on the lower lands and in the\r\nvalleys. Since the glacial epoch the rivers have cut their beds a score\r\nof feet and more below the deposits of glacial floods and in many\r\nplaces, as near the Ivanhoe bridge, remnants of these ancient flood\r\nplains are left as terraces or \"benches\" or \"second bottoms.\" At\r\nBertram the sands deposited by glacial waters near the mouth of Big\r\nCreek stand about fifty feet above the level of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOESS\r\n\r\nA large part of the county is covered with a deposit of fine yellow\r\nsilt called loess. Dry, it crumbles into powder at a finger touch; wet,\r\nit is somewhat plastic and can be moulded into brick and tile. On the\r\nhill and uplands the loess is thickly spread, adding in places at least\r\nforty feet to their elevation. Over the lowlands it is thin or absent.\r\nThis yellow earth has been and is to be of greater value than mines of\r\nyellow gold. It is of inexhaustible fertility. It contains abundant\r\nmineral plant foods, partly constituent, and partly brought up into it\r\nby ground water; and these foods are so finely pulverized as to be of\r\nreadiest solution and absorption by the roots. In wet weather the loess\r\nmantle absorbs the rainfall like a sponge; in months of desert drouth,\r\nlike those of the summer of 1910, it returns the water to the surface,\r\nlike a wick, to preserve the crops from failure.\r\n\r\nA disadvantage of the loess lies in the readiness with which it washes.\r\nThe forest which once covered nearly all the uplands protected the soil\r\nfrom wash by means of its mattress of roots and the thick prairie sod\r\nwas equally efficient where hill slopes were grassed over. But where\r\nforests have been thoughtlessly cut down, and steep slopes turned to\r\nplow land, it is but a few years until the brown top-soil is all washed\r\naway and the fields in spring when freshly plowed are as yellow as a\r\ndeep cut in road or brick yard. The foot path in the pasture or the\r\nfurrow of the plow becomes a gully in a single heavy rain, and unless\r\nchecked soon becomes a gulch scores of feet in width.\r\n\r\nBy accenting the height of the ridges the loess also adds to the\r\nscenery of the county. Our area lies in a part of east central Iowa\r\nwhere the stony clays deposited by ancient glaciers accumulated in long\r\nridges and belts of upland rising many feet above the intervening\r\nundulating plains. Because of the alternation of ridge and lowland no\r\npart of the state except the valley of the Upper Mississippi has so\r\nbeautiful and wide and varied prospects. Over more or less of their\r\ncourse the rivers of the county have cut their channels lengthwise in\r\nthe ridges, thus giving rise to the bold scenery of the Wapsipinicon\r\nabove Central City, and of the Cedar near Mount Vernon. Some of these\r\npicturesque reaches of river and cliff and forest slope should surely\r\nbe converted into county parks in the near future and preserved for the\r\ngratification of all coming generations. Unless this is done we may\r\nexpect that the forests will be cut down and the hill slopes gashed\r\nwith countless gullies; while the lichened rocks of the river cliffs\r\nfringed with fern and tamarisk will give place to unsightly quarries.\r\n\r\nWhile Linn county was sheeted with glacier ice, no life of any sort was\r\npossible within its limits. But during the long interglacial epochs\r\nwhich intervened between the ice invasions, forests grew and animals\r\nnow extinct roamed over our hills and plains. Among these early\r\ninhabitants may be mentioned extinct horses and the giant\r\nproboscidians, the mammoth, and the mastodon. These returned to the\r\narea after the final retreat of the ice and their remains are found in\r\nthe peat bogs and river gravels. In the earliest of the interglacial\r\nepochs it is quite probable that some of the gigantic groundsloths of\r\nSouth America made their home here, since they are known to have done\r\nso in the western counties of the state. No traces of man have been\r\nfound in the glacial deposits of Iowa, nor have any indubitable\r\nevidences of his presence in glacial times been found in North America.\r\nSometime, we know not when, roving tribes of Indians set foot within\r\nour area, and geology gives place to archeology. And when the white man\r\nappeared, inductive history ends and there begins the history of\r\ntradition and written records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_Beginnings in Linn County_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Black Hawk war, though confined to the state of Illinois, made an\r\nepoch in the history of Iowa. It was the last of the many Indian wars,\r\nand was concluded by a cession of much of the valuable lands of Iowa to\r\nthe government. Reports of the war had stirred up more or less\r\nenthusiasm as to the future of the west, and settlers began to come\r\nsoon after the war had ended. Many of the officers, and others who had\r\ntaken part in the war, became the government agents and officials in\r\nvarious capacities in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The government\r\nalso, through its representatives in congress, planned great things for\r\nthe west in opening canals and roads, while rivers were made navigable\r\nand steamship traffic opened up.\r\n\r\nOne must not be led to believe that Iowa was the only part of the west\r\nwhich grew so rapidly. The growth was general, it is true, but Iowa\r\nseems to have grown more rapidly than any other of the territories\r\nbetween 1836 and 1846.\r\n\r\nIllinois was admitted as a state in 1818; Missouri three years later;\r\nnext came Iowa in 1846, while Wisconsin, which had been explored in\r\n1639, was not admitted to statehood till 1848; and Minnesota, settled\r\nas early as 1680, and having a fort built in 1820, was not admitted to\r\nstatehood till 1858. Thus, it would appear, that Iowa remained a\r\nterritory for a shorter period of time than any other of the western\r\nstates located in the Mississippi valley, but, of course, there is\r\nreason for this. It was a prairie state, in the first instance, and on\r\nthe east was bounded by a great waterway and by a state teeming with an\r\naggressive population, many of whose people soon crossed the borderland\r\neven before the government had made proper surveys and thrown the land\r\nopen to settlement.\r\n\r\nHenry Dodge was appointed governor of the new Territory of Wisconsin in\r\n1836, Iowa at that time being a part of Wisconsin. With the exception\r\nof a few settlements of white people along Lake Michigan and in the\r\nmining region around Dubuque there were few, if any, white settlers.\r\nGovernor Dodge's work was largely with the Indians, in making contracts\r\nand ceding lands to the government. Settlers were coming in constantly\r\nand a demand for a survey of the lands was made from time to time.\r\nSurvey of the public lands in Iowa was begun in the fall of 1836. Great\r\npreparations for the land sales were made. These were to take place in\r\nDubuque and Burlington in November, 1838. The settlers who had arrived\r\non these lands for some time prior to its survey arranged among\r\nthemselves to select an arbitration association, each township making a\r\nregister of all claims, and choosing one representative to attend the\r\nland sales, giving him authority to bid off the lands selected by each\r\nclaimant.\r\n\r\nA. C. Dodge was appointed the first registrar of the land office at\r\nBurlington, and George W. Jones the first surveyor-general of Iowa. One\r\nof the surveyors-general in the early '40s was no other than Judge\r\nJames Wilson, of Keene, New Hampshire, a son of a Revolutionary\r\nsoldier, and himself a lawyer of more than ordinary ability, a judge,\r\nand at one time a member of congress. He was appointed by General\r\nHarrison, an old friend.\r\n\r\nAt the first convention which met at Burlington in November, 1837, for\r\nthe purpose of organizing a separate territory of Iowa, were the\r\nfollowing delegates from Dubuque county, which, at that time, included\r\na part of what later became Linn county: P. H. Engle, J. I. Fales, G.\r\nW. Harris, W. A. Warren, W. B. Watts, A. F. Russell, W. H. Patton, J.\r\nW. Parker, J. D. Bell and J. H. Rose. The convention in its petition to\r\ncongress asserted that there were 25,000 people in that portion of\r\nWisconsin Territory known as \"The Iowa District;\" that houses had been\r\nerected; that farms were cultivated, and still people could not obtain\r\ntitle to their lands, and asking that the part west of the river be set\r\naside as a separate territory. This was one of the most important\r\nconventions held on what became Iowa soil, and congress at once took\r\naction to make such provisions as were thought wise and expedient.\r\n\r\nLinn county was established by an act of the legislature of the\r\nTerritory of Wisconsin approved on December 21, 1837. The county was\r\nregular in shape, but four townships larger than its neighbors on the\r\nnorth and east, which were created at the same time. The boundaries\r\nreceived at this time have not been altered. The spelling of the name\r\nwas Lynn, although it was spelled in the body of the act itself Linn;\r\nit took its name from Dr. Louis F. Linn, United States senator from\r\nMissouri, who was appointed to that office in 1833 and who was a friend\r\nand admirer of President Jackson, and much interested in the\r\ndevelopment of the west.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of Linn county, perhaps one-third, had been part of\r\nthe original county of Dubuque since 1834, the boundary line running\r\nfrom the southeast corner of the county in a northwesterly line a\r\nlittle to the west of the middle in the northern part of the county.\r\nLinn county then embraces within its limits two Indian land cessions.\r\nThe eastern part was acquired from the Sac and Fox Indians by the\r\ntreaty of September 21, 1832, known as the Black Hawk Purchase; the\r\nwestern part, or the other two-thirds, was acquired by treaty of\r\nOctober 21, 1837. The fourteen counties created by an act sub-dividing\r\nDubuque county into new counties, which was approved October 21, 1837,\r\nwere as follows: Dubuque, Clayton, Jackson, Benton, Linn, Jones,\r\nClinton, Johnson, Scott, Delaware, Buchanan, Cedar, Fayette, and\r\nKeokuk. While most of these counties were established outright the\r\nwording of the act relating to Dubuque county implies that it was\r\nlooked upon as the former county reduced in size, which was not\r\ncorrect, as this land from which these counties were laid out also\r\nincluded much of the Sac and Fox cession made after Dubuque county had\r\nbeen formed and laid out, and which county had not been ceded to the\r\nUnited States government.\r\n\r\nThese boundary lines were reduced in size later; however the boundaries\r\nof Dubuque, Delaware, Jackson, Jones, Linn, Clinton, Cedar, and Scott\r\nhave remained as they were laid out at the time. The Territory of Iowa\r\nwas created by an act of congress approved June 12, 1838.\r\n\r\nAmong the bills passed by the first legislature, which met during the\r\nwinter of 1838 and 1839, was the following: \"An Act to Organize the\r\nCounty of Linn, and establish the Seat of Justice thereof.\r\n\r\n     \"Section 1.

Approved January 15, 1839.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the Commissioners named in the act, Richard Knott and Benjamin\r\nNye, accepted the trust, meeting at the house of William Abbe, two and\r\none-half miles west of what is now Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners located the county seat in the middle of the county\r\nand named it \"Marion,\" in honor of one of the Revolutionary generals.\r\nThe Commissioners reported to the governor of the territory the\r\ncompletion of their work, and Governor Robert Lucas proclaimed the\r\ncounty of Linn duly established.\r\n\r\nFor election purposes Linn county was attached to Cedar, Johnson, and\r\nJones, the first polling precinct being located at Westport, which had\r\nbeen laid out by Israel Mitchell with the expectation that this would\r\nbe the county seat, Mr. Mitchell believing that the county seat should\r\nbe located on the river, and that that location would be near enough\r\nthe center for all practical purposes.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1838, the entire county composed one precinct, and\r\nthirty-two ballots were cast for candidates for the legislature.\r\nCharles Whittlesey was chosen for the senate and Robert G. Roberts for\r\nthe house. The first county election was held in August, 1839, when\r\nthree commissioners were selected at Westport--L. M. Strong, Peter\r\nMcRoberts, and Samuel C. Stewart. This body had the same powers as was\r\nlater conferred upon the county supervisors. This commission first sat\r\nas a body officially September 9, 1839, in the log house of James W.\r\nWillis. Hosea W. Gray was sheriff and acted as clerk of the court until\r\na clerk was duly appointed.\r\n\r\nThe minutes state:\r\n\r\n     \"The Board proceeded to the appointment of a Clerk.\r\n     Thereupon it was ordered that John C. Berry be and is hereby\r\n     appointed to the office of Clerk of the Board of Linn County\r\n     Commissioners.\r\n\r\n     \"Ordered. That the county seat of Linn County be and is\r\n     hereby called and shall hereafter be known and designated by\r\n     the name of Marion.\"\r\n\r\nAt this session W. H. Smith and Andrew J. McKean were appointed\r\nconstables for the county. Jonas Martin was appointed road supervisor,\r\nhis district embracing all the land east of Marion and west of Big\r\ncreek and east on the Marion and Davenport roads crossing Big creek.\r\n\"It was also authorized that as Linn County had no safe place for the\r\nkeeping of criminals that Sheriff Gray contract with the Sheriff of\r\nMuscatine County for the keeping of one Samuel Clews, and that the\r\nSheriff borrow funds to pay for the support and keeping of said Clews\r\nwhile in confinement.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that the board met monthly and the county was divided into\r\nthree voting precincts as follows: One at William Abbe's, known as\r\nSugar Grove Precinct, with the following judges: William Abbe, John\r\nCole, and John McAfferty; one at Marion, with James W. Bassett, Henry\r\nThompson, and Rufus H. Lucore, judges; one at Michael Greene's, with\r\nMichael Greene, James Cummings, and Bartimeas McGonigle, judges.\r\n\r\nAt this time Ross McCloud was appointed county surveyor and was ordered\r\nto make the survey of the county seat and report, which he did, and\r\nalso to lay out additions, which was done. A county jail was also\r\nordered erected in January, 1840, and the contract for the building of\r\nthe same was let to William Abbe and Asher Edgerton for the sum of\r\n$635.00; the first money raised by sale of lots in Marion was applied\r\non the contract for the erection of the jail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SURVEY\r\n\r\nThe first survey was made in 1838, being all of Jones county and\r\ntownships 84, 85, and 86 north, in range 5, west, in Linn county. This\r\nwas made public in the newspapers and many settlers came in, taking the\r\nbest lands that had been surveyed and squatting on the other land which\r\nthey knew would soon be open for settlement. Linn Grove was an ideal\r\nplace, and here in an early day a large number settled. The sale of\r\nlands in the county was advertised to take place in January, 1840. On\r\naccount of the difficulties of transportation, the settlers petitioned\r\nto have the same postponed until the summer of that year, which\r\npetition was granted. George Greene, who had been a school teacher near\r\nIvanhoe and even at that time was a man of no ordinary ability, was\r\nasked to see what could be done in changing the place from Dubuque to\r\nMarion. Mr. Greene volunteered to go to Washington and lay the matter\r\nbefore congress, or the men in charge of the land department. After\r\nsome time he succeeded in his mission and won the grateful respect of\r\nhis fellow pioneers, saving them a great deal of money. Thus, for a\r\ntime, Marion was a United States land office, and the people of Linn\r\ncounty who had little money to spend could claim their lands without\r\nmuch trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST COURT HOUSE IN THE COUNTY\r\n\r\nThe first court house built in the county was a log structure for the\r\nuse of the pioneers. This structure was erected during the years 1840\r\nand 1841. As there was no money in the county treasury and as the court\r\nhouse was needed, the settlers donated their labor. They cut the logs,\r\nhauled them to Marion, and constructed the building, the roof being of\r\nshakes and the floor of puncheons. Among those who helped erect this\r\nfirst seat of justice were James and John Hunter, the Stambaugh\r\nbrothers, James and Elias Doty, and others. The first case, it is said,\r\ntried in this court house was one brought against James Doty for\r\njumping a claim on the west side of the river, adjoining the claim of\r\nRobert Ellis, the question being whether or not a man erecting a bark\r\nbuilding and claiming the land had complied with the law. The jury was\r\nimpaneled and a trial had which lasted for some time. When the case\r\nwent to the jury the judge and all vacated so that the jury could use\r\nthe small room in arriving at a decision. The jury was out the\r\nafternoon and all night, and at ten o'clock the next morning they\r\nreported that they were unable to agree. During all this time they had\r\nhad nothing to eat, and the water they had to drink was very poor. Upon\r\nthis jury sat James Hunter, one of the first settlers of the county,\r\nwho was the only stubborn one to hold out in favor of Doty. He used to\r\ntell later that he felt that he could never look James Doty in the face\r\nif he should consent to such a verdict as the other eleven had framed\r\nup against him. The case was tried at a subsequent term when the jury\r\ndecided in favor of Doty, to the effect that while he was later than\r\nthe claimant in making his claim he was a _bona fide_ settler with the\r\nintention of becoming a permanent settler.\r\n\r\nThe next court house built in Marion was a frame structure still\r\nstanding just west of the present brick building, and now used as a\r\nhotel. The present brick court house was erected by George W. Gray, the\r\nbrick superstructure being built by Peter D. Harman, of Bertram, father\r\nof Warren Harman, of Cedar Rapids. Much of the carpenter work was done\r\nby that old pioneer, recently deceased, William Patterson, father of W.\r\nD. Patterson, of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe first jail was erected in January, 1840, the contract for the\r\nbuilding being awarded to William Abbe and Asher Edgerton for $635.00.\r\nThe building was finished by May 1st of the same year. The first moneys\r\nraised by sale of lands were applied on this contract.\r\n\r\nAt the July session, 1849, the county was divided into three districts\r\nas follows: the townships of Washington and Fayette composed District\r\nNo. 1; Franklin and Brown composed District No. 2; and Marion and\r\nPutnam District No. 3. At the July session, 1840, the board of\r\ncommissioners began to discuss the question of township organizations.\r\nA vote of the county was ordered at the next election to determine the\r\nvoice of the people; the election took place in August of that year and\r\nresulted in favor of the proposition.\r\n\r\nLists of townships are as follows: Marion, Franklin, Washington,\r\nFayette, Putnam, and Brown established in 1841; Linn and Rapids, 1843;\r\nOtter Creek, 1844; Buffalo and Maine, 1848; Monroe, 1849; Spring Grove,\r\n1853; Clinton, 1854; Jackson, 1855; College, Bertram, Boulder, and\r\nFairfax, 1858; Grant, 1872; and Cedar, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIARY\r\n\r\nThe first records of the district court held in Linn county are dated\r\nMonday, October 26, 1840, Iowa Territory, Linn county. Pursuant to an\r\nact of the legislature of the territory, approved July, 1840, the\r\ndistrict court of the United States and also for the Territory of Iowa\r\nmet at Marion in said county on Monday, October 26, 1840. Present: The\r\nHon. Jos. D. Williams, judge of the second judicial district for the\r\nterritory; W. G. Woodward, district attorney of the United States for\r\nthe district of Iowa; R. P. Lowe, prosecuting attorney for the second\r\njudicial district; H. W. Gray, sheriff of the county of Linn; S. H.\r\nTryon, clerk of the district court; Lawrence Maloney for the marshal of\r\nthe territory.\r\n\r\nThe following grand jurors were among the best known settlers: Aaron\r\nUsher, Samuel Ross, James Leverich, D. W. King, Israel Mitchell, W. H.\r\nChambers, William Donahoo, Dan Curtis, W. T. Gilberts, G. A. Patterson,\r\nIsaac Butler, John Goudy, J. A. Gibson, Joe Barnett, Asher Edgerton,\r\nWilliam Chambers, O. L. Bolling, Dan J. Doty, and Joseph Warford. As\r\nbailiff of the grand jury served Perry Oxley, one of the best known\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nThe petit jurors were: D. A. Woodbridge, Isaac Carroll, G. W. Gray, B.\r\nMcGonegal, John McCloud, Thomas Goudy, J. W. Willis, John Long, J. W.\r\nMargrove, Ira Simmons, John Crow, Joe Carroway, Steve Osborn, H. B.\r\nMason, O. R. Gregory, John Nation, Thomas Maxwell, and George Yiesly.\r\n\r\nOne of the early cases of record is that of A. Moriarty vs. N. G.\r\nNiece. One of the early jury trials was that of H. C. Dill vs. John\r\nBarnett: one of the first criminal cases was that of Territory vs. W.\r\nK. Farnsworth, indicted for starting a prairie fire; the jury returned\r\na verdict of \"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThe probate docket is a very small volume but is filled with entries of\r\nmuch historical interest concerning the old citizens of the territory.\r\nAmong a number of entries can be found the following: In the estate of\r\nA. Coles, claim filed and allowed November 8, 1842; in the estate of\r\nThomas Gray, claims allowed in 1844; in the estate of J. Barnett,\r\nclaims allowed in 1843 in favor of Israel Mitchell in the amount of\r\n$4.50; in the estate of John Crow, claims allowed 1842, as well as\r\nagainst the estate of Elias Doty, administered upon in 1843 by M. J.\r\nDoty and Jos. Crain, administrators. The estate of A. L. Ely takes up a\r\nnumber of pages.\r\n\r\nThe first default case seems to be listed for the October term, 1840,\r\nthat of James D. Stockton vs. Stephen Osborn, et al, the claim being\r\nassigned by John O. Gray to plaintiff. The next case was that of Thomas\r\nW. Campbell and Perry Oxley vs. John Barnett, which was a transcript\r\nfrom J. G. Cole, a justice of the peace. R. P. Lowe acted as district\r\nattorney, while Isaac Butler was foreman of the grand jury.\r\n\r\nThe first entry made by a native of a foreign country to become a\r\ncitizen of the United States was made by Peter Garron, stating that he\r\nwas then a resident of Linn county and that he was formerly a subject\r\nof Scotland of the United Kingdom of England and Ireland, and that it\r\nwas his intention to renounce allegiance to Queen Victoria and become a\r\nfaithful citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first divorce action was brought by Dyer Usher against Mary Usher\r\nat the October term, 1842, but it seems that the notice of publication\r\nwas not served as ordered and no decree was granted.\r\n\r\nThe first decree of divorce granted was that on the petition of Mrs.\r\nParthena C. Hewitt vs. Abraham Hewitt, rendered at the March term,\r\n1844.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUIT COURT\r\n\r\nPursuant to an act of the legislature of Iowa, approved April 3, 1868,\r\nthe county of Linn became part of the second circuit of the eighth\r\njudicial district, the circuit consisting of Cedar, Linn, and Jones\r\ncounties, Hon. S. Yates, of Cedar, being elected judge.\r\n\r\nThe first term was held at Marion January, 1869, when W. G. Thompson\r\nappeared as prosecuting attorney and A. J. McKean as clerk.\r\n\r\nThe legislature in a few years changed the boundaries of this circuit,\r\nmaking it composed of Cedar, Linn, Johnson, Jones, Iowa, Tama, and\r\nBenton counties. It was known as the eighth district of the circuit and\r\ndistrict courts. John McKean was judge of the circuit court and John\r\nShane, of Vinton, judge of the district court.\r\n\r\nBy an act of the legislature the circuit court was abolished and Linn\r\ncounty was incorporated into a district composed of Linn, Cedar, and\r\nJones counties with three judges.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTED AND EXCITING TRIALS\r\n\r\nLinn county has had its share of noted trials, and many are the pages\r\nwhich may be gleaned from its musty records to show how treachery,\r\ncowardice, and selfishness have here, as in many other places, played\r\ntheir parts. It is not best to uncover many of these pages, as it would\r\nperhaps add nothing to the general information or be of any value\r\nexcept as historical relics of a former age.\r\n\r\nOne of the first murder cases in the county, at least as far as known,\r\nwas that of Nathan Carnagy who was brutally assaulted by James Reed in\r\nMarion in 1847. Reed had been drinking heavily and got into a quarrel\r\nwith Carnagy about some old trouble. Reed was arrested, tried before a\r\njury, and acquitted.\r\n\r\nAnother case was that of the killing of Pat O'Connell by Samuel Butler\r\nin 1865, the affair growing out of a dispute over some property\r\ninterests. The parties met on a public highway, a quarrel ensued with\r\ndisastrous results. The jury in this case also returned a verdict of\r\n\"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, CEDAR RAPIDS, COMPLETED IN\r\n1851]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESIDENCE OF WILLISTON JONES, WHERE COE COLLEGE WAS BORN\r\nFROM CARROLL'S HISTORY]\r\n\r\nJohn Akers was murdered in a saloon in Cedar Rapids in 1864 by one\r\nDecklots; the jury returned a verdict of \"guilty.\" This sad affair was\r\ndue to liquor, both parties being more or less under its influence at\r\nthe time the quarrel began.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of murder cases of an appalling nature on record;\r\nsometimes a conviction and sometimes an acquittal resulted.\r\n\r\nOn the civil side of the calendar can be found many cases attracting\r\nattention, sometimes on account of the charges made, at other times on\r\naccount of the large amounts of money involved. In this forum\r\nmagnificent addresses were heard, and no lawyer practicing at the Linn\r\ncounty bar was ever a miser of his eccentricities, whatever they might\r\nhave been. Most of them had the thread of the attorney in their nature\r\nand took to oratory like a duck to water, and most of them in these\r\nearly pioneer days went in to win the jury at all hazards, possessing\r\nthe power to stir the heart and to make their personality felt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ERA OF THE OUTLAW\r\n\r\nAlong the American frontier were always found the outlaws; sometimes\r\nthey outnumbered the honest settler and sometimes not, depending more\r\nor less upon conditions. Outlaws preferred to hover on the frontier\r\nwhere courts of justice were unknown and where the sons of toil, busy\r\nwith making a living, had no time to defend themselves against\r\noutlawry. Some of these outlaws had committed theft and robbery and\r\nwere living upon this borderland of civilization, knowing that it would\r\nbe perfectly safe under assumed names. Others came here for the special\r\npurpose, knowing it was easier to make a living by theft than by honest\r\ntoil. Thus, the Linn county frontier at an early date was infested with\r\nthis class of people, and for a number of years the rights of the\r\npeople had to be protected by associations organized for this purpose,\r\nand made up of the best class in the community, until such a time as\r\nlaw and order could be enforced by decrees of court and by penitentiary\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\nWhen the first white settler came into the Red Cedar valley there were\r\nonly two counties fully organized west of the Mississippi, with the\r\nexception of the state of Missouri. These counties were Dubuque and Des\r\nMoines. They extended from a flag station at Fort Armstrong back into\r\nthe country forty miles, and from the Missouri line to a line running\r\nwestward from Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin. It was a large tract of\r\ncountry, and offered secure hiding places for law violators. In this\r\nwild country, along rivers where the timber was thick, hiding places\r\nfor the outlaw were offered, and when settlers did come in the outlaw\r\ndid not like to remove, and, consequently tormented the actual settler\r\nand frequently took by stealth or force such personal property as he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nIn the early day the country bordering on the Cedar river was flooded\r\nwith counterfeiters, and it is stated that this counterfeit money was\r\nso well made that it was difficult to tell which was the good money and\r\nwhich the bad and, in fact, at times it seems that the good money was a\r\nscarce article. No one was able to tell where this counterfeit money\r\ncame from, but it is supposed very little, if any, was made here but\r\nthat it was imported from other places and distributed by \"healers\" on\r\na percentage basis. While a cry was raised against counterfeit money,\r\nonly the government could handle such cases and very little was done to\r\nstart proceedings. Now and then the government attorney would bring a\r\ncase or two, but as a rule the defendants were generally released by a\r\njury, many of whom were friends of the parties accused.\r\n\r\nIt was not until horse stealing became prevalent that the people arose\r\nin arms against the outlaw and formed associations called \"anti-horse\r\nthief\" associations. It was a difficult thing at first to prosecute,\r\nas the gang was well organized and had a perfect system of stations,\r\nagents, signs, and signals. The members of these gangs which infested\r\nCedar, Jones, and Linn counties in the early days dressed better than\r\nthe honest farmer, were more charitable, and in the day time, at least,\r\nwere looked upon as the most respectable persons in the community. They\r\nwere shrewd and cunning in their business transactions, and hedged\r\nthemselves in such a way as to escape detection and exposure for a long\r\ntime. These \"free booters\" and plunderers would move from county to\r\ncounty and from community to community if things got a little hot and\r\nthey feared exposure. In counties where they were in the majority they\r\nwould intimidate and scare the actual settlers, even if these knew\r\npositively that depredations had been made. And frequently the honest\r\nsettler who attacked and complained was forced to leave the country\r\ninstead of the outlaw who had many friends who came to his rescue. Many\r\na man who was known to make a complaint before a grand jury, to a\r\nprosecuting attorney, or judge would be trailed by a company of\r\noutlaws, threatening letters would be written against himself and\r\nmembers of his family, that his buildings would be destroyed by fire if\r\nhe persisted in bringing suits or attempted to file an information of\r\nany kind against any members of the band.\r\n\r\nA few of these men who were at least accused of being members of these\r\nvarious gangs of counterfeiters, horse thieves and other desperadoes\r\nmay be mentioned.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noted ones were the members of the Brodie gang,\r\ncomposed of John Brodie, and his four sons--John, Jr., Stephen,\r\nWilliam, and Hugh--who came into Linn county in 1839 and were among the\r\nfirst settlers in this county. They were natives of Ohio. Some had\r\nlived in Michigan for a time, and before coming here had commenced\r\ntheir career of villainy. On account of some misdemeanor they were\r\ndriven from Clear Ford on the Mohican river in what is now Ashland\r\ncounty, Ohio, in 1830 or 1831, and sought refuge for a time in Steuben\r\ncounty, Indiana. Here they remained for a couple of years when they\r\nbecame so notorious as to arouse the country against them, and they\r\nfled westward in about 1835 and found their way into what was known as\r\nthe Rock river country, or Brodie's Grove, Dement township, Ogle\r\ncounty, Illinois. In this part of Illinois at this time the country was\r\ncompletely under the control of outlaws and desperadoes, and here the\r\nBrodies found congenial companionship.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1839 the Brodies gang were driven out by an organized society\r\ncalled the \"regulators,\" composed of law abiding people who insisted\r\nupon law enforcement. They then drifted westward and located in Linn\r\ncounty. From this time on for a number of years there was scarcely a\r\nterm of court but that one or more members of this family was arraigned\r\nfor trial on some criminal charge or other.\r\n\r\nSam Leterel, Christian Gove, James Case, also known as Jim Stoutenberg,\r\nMcConlogue, Squires, McBroom, and others were members of this gang.\r\nMcConlogue resided for a time at Cedar Bluffs, later removing into\r\nJohnson county where Morse is now located. Stoutenberg resided at times\r\nwith McConlogue and at times with Squires. A number of others\r\nassociated with the gang and lived on the borders of Linn and adjoining\r\ncounties and went by various names. Where they came from no one knew\r\nand they dropped out of sight if there was any danger of arrest and\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 John Goudy and his son-in-law, Thomas McElheny, and a son\r\nsettled in Linn county, and it was noised abroad that the family was\r\nvery wealthy. To ascertain whether or not they had money, some time in\r\nApril, 1840, a man by the name of Switzer was sent to visit the Goudys\r\nunder the pretense of wanting to borrow money, the real object being to\r\nascertain whether or not the parties kept money and whether or not he\r\ncould obtain a pretended loan. The loan was declined for some reason or\r\nother, but it is supposed that Switzer learned enough in his talk with\r\nthe Goudy family to know that they had money and there would be a\r\nchance to make a good haul. The gang went up along the Cedar river on\r\nthe west side and crossed the river about where Goudy's home was. Here\r\nMcConlogue had some conversation with a person who knew him. About\r\nmidnight of a day in April the door of the Goudy cabin was forced open\r\nand the inmates awoke to find themselves surrounded by five burglars\r\nwho threatened their lives if they did not give up their money. Old Mr.\r\nGoudy replied that he had but little money, only $40.00, and that they\r\ncould find that in his vest pocket. The vest was searched and the money\r\nfound. They insisted that he had more and demanded it. The old man\r\npersisted that it was every dollar he had, or that was about the house.\r\nThe leader of the gang then ordered the house to be searched and\r\ndirected the occupants of the beds to cover their heads at once. In the\r\nshuffle for places Mrs. McElheny, a daughter of Goudy, recognized\r\nSwitzer, who had been there to borrow the money a few days before, and\r\nalso another member of the gang who was well known by the family. In\r\nthe search for money a purse containing $120.00 belonging to a\r\ndaughter, Hannah, was found by the burglars. In an old leather belt\r\nused by Mr. Goudy there was also a $100.00 bill which the robbers\r\noverlooked or could not find in their hurry to search the house.\r\n\r\nThey became very angry at not finding any more money, having expected\r\nto find $9,000.00 which Mr. Goudy was reported to have had in the house\r\nat the time. The robbers on leaving the house cursed every member of\r\nthe family, and seemed much put out at the haul they had made. Captain\r\nThomas H. Goudy, a married son, lived near his father's cabin. He had\r\nbeen a captain of militia in Ohio and his uniform was hanging upon the\r\nwall. The robbers seeing this remarked \"a military officer must be a\r\nrich man,\" and his money was demanded, but they received nothing, and\r\nafter turning over everything in the house and finding only some\r\nprovisions, they left Goudy and went to the cabin of William F.\r\nGilbert, another prominent settler in the neighborhood, who was also\r\nsupposed to have considerable money. On the night in question Gilbert\r\nhad stopping with him three men, the mail carrier who operated a stage\r\nbetween Dubuque and Iowa City, and two others. In the Gilbert house, as\r\nin the other house, the cabin consisted of only one room with several\r\nbeds, and on this night Mrs. Goudy and her children occupied one bed,\r\nthe strangers another bed, while Goudy and the mail carrier slept on\r\nthe floor by the fire. The entrance of the robbers was so sudden that\r\nbefore the occupants knew what was going on they were covered with guns\r\nand clubs, and their money was demanded. Goudy rallied to defend his\r\nhome, and so did the mail carrier who slept near the door. Both men\r\nwere knocked down and the cheek bone on one side of the mail carrier's\r\nface was smashed completely by a blow from a club wielded by one of the\r\nrobbers.\r\n\r\nThe house was thoroughly searched and the drawer of a box which was\r\nsupposed to be opened by a secret spring known to no one but members of\r\nthe family was forced and a $50.00 bill and some $30.00 or $40.00 in\r\nchange were found and taken. While all the older members were\r\nfrightened Mr. Goudy's son, during the plundering, arose in bed and\r\nrecognized a neighbor--one Goodrich, who lived but a half mile\r\ndistant--as one of the robbers. This neighbor had up to this time been\r\nlooked upon as a respectable man. It was he who opened the drawer as\r\nquickly as though he was one of the family. The robbers secured as\r\ntheir share of the booty this night about $240.00. A young daughter of\r\nMr. Goudy, who remembered well that night, was later married to Judge\r\nJohn Shane, of Vinton, a well known jurist and a most excellent judge.\r\n\r\nThis wholesale robbery stirred the whole country, and Captain Thomas\r\nGoudy especially, being a military man, insisted that now it was high\r\ntime for the people to arouse themselves and if the officers of the law\r\nrefused to do anything then the settlers would take the law into their\r\nown hands and start something going. Thomas and his father went to J.\r\nW. Tallman at Antwerp and Colonel Prior Scott at Pioneer Grove for\r\nadvice and counsel, and especially to apprehend one Wallace who was\r\nimplicated in this robbery. Colonel Scott went among his people and\r\norganized a \"mutual protective association,\" the settlers hunted up\r\ntheir rifles and shot guns, and the organization was ready to begin\r\nwork. Wallace had fled, but pursuers were on his track and he was\r\napprehended in Illinois City in Illinois, ten miles above Muscatine, by\r\na citizen named Coleman and turned over to Thomas Goudy and his party.\r\nColeman's reputation in the vicinity was not the best and he had been\r\nsuspected of harboring outlaws, but it was stated on account of some\r\ndifficulty in the division of spoils he and Wallace had had a falling\r\nout and hence Wallace's easy capture.\r\n\r\nA warrant was taken out for the arrest of Switzer, and when Wallace was\r\nreturned Switzer was also arrested and a preliminary examination was\r\nheld before John G. Cole, one of the first justices of the peace in\r\nLinn county. Both of the parties were held to bail. Their cases came on\r\nfor trial at Tipton at the October term, 1841, of the district court.\r\n\r\nJames W. Tallman, a resident of Antwerp, accompanied by several\r\nneighbors, started out to arrest Switzer, a large man and an ugly one.\r\nSwitzer resided near Halderman's mill. At two o'clock in the morning a\r\nposse surrounded Switzer's home. He refused to open the door and they\r\nwaited till daylight before he was taken in custody. Switzer's cabin\r\nwas a perfect arsenal, there being guns, pistols, and ugly knives\r\nscattered all around.\r\n\r\nLater James Stoutenberg, also known as Jim Case, was arrested at\r\nMcConlogue's as an accomplice and member of the gang. He was taken into\r\nthe woods near McConlogue's and examined in the court of \"Judge Lynch\"\r\nin order to obtain a confession from him, and he was finally tied to a\r\ntree and severely flogged. He was never seen alive again. Some assert\r\nthat he left the country, and others that members of the party carried\r\nhim to the Cedar river, tied him to a stone raft and left him to his\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nMcConlogue was also arrested as being a member of the gang in the\r\nrobbery, but he established an alibi. Being satisfied that he was\r\nguilty of helping to plan the robbery, the pioneer settlers, duly\r\naroused, tried him by rules not known in the ordinary law court. He was\r\nsentenced to be hanged, but finally it was agreed that this sentence\r\nshould be changed to whipping, and that each one of the citizens should\r\ngive him five lashes on the bare back, and if that failed to bring a\r\nconfession as to the particulars of the robbery and the extent and\r\nnames of the gang, then he should be whipped the second time until he\r\ndied. Blows continued to fall upon his quivering and bleeding back\r\nuntil he implored for mercy and promised to reveal all he knew about\r\nthe robbery and the operations of the \"free booters.\" He admitted\r\nhaving knowledge of the Goudy robbery and that he received as his share\r\nof the booty $25.00. He also admitted that Wallace was the leader of\r\nthe gang at this time and that Switzer was another member of the gang\r\nof five men who perpetrated the robbery. The members of the association\r\nafter this confession let him go, but first applied a solution of salt\r\non his lacerated flesh, followed by an application of slippery elm bark\r\nto remind him of the ordeal he had recently passed through, and which\r\nhe never forgot. At this time McConlogue was under indictment in\r\nJohnson county for assaulting a man named Brown with intent to rob him;\r\non this charge he was tried and sent to the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nGoodrich, a neighbor of the Gilberts, who had taken part in the robbery\r\nand who had been recognized by the latter's son, was also horse whipped\r\nand gagged at the same time but he refused to answer any questions and\r\ndenied having taken part in the robbery. Soon after this he removed\r\nfrom the county and was never heard of afterwards.\r\n\r\nMcConlogue's admission implicated McBroom, who had been known for some\r\ntime previously as one of the brightest men of the gang, and who was\r\nalso supposed to be a lawyer. He was also caught and whipped nearly to\r\ndeath near what is known as Scott's mill, without making any\r\nconfession, but with threat that if anything more was heard of any\r\nattempted robbery of any kind by any member of the gang everyone,\r\nincluding himself, would be swung up to the first oak tree. It is\r\nneedless to say that he immediately left the country and was never\r\nheard of again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIEL SEWARD HAHN One of the First Settlers in Linn\r\nCounty]\r\n\r\nWilliam Stretch, an old settler, many years afterwards made a trip down\r\nthe Mississippi and there in one of the river cities, either New\r\nOrleans or Memphis, he met and recognized McBroom who had been so\r\nseverely flogged on the banks of the Cedar river. McBroom claimed that\r\nhe had lived an honest life since removing from the Cedar river and he\r\nbegged Stretch not to say anything about it, at least in his new home.\r\nStretch agreed to this, but investigated to ascertain whether or not\r\nMcBroom had told the facts, and found that he was a respectable\r\ncitizen, one of the leaders in that city, and had accumulated a\r\nfortune--between forty and fifty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the gang, a cousin of the Brodie boys, and in many\r\nways a bad fellow, was overtaken in Washington township, this county,\r\nwhile driving and there shot by a band of what was known as\r\n\"regulators\" or members of the \"anti-horse thief association.\"\r\nSeventeen bullets had penetrated his body. Who had a hand in this act\r\nis not known, although the members are said to have belonged to some of\r\nthe first families of the county. When Wilson was caught he was passing\r\nthrough the county with a team of stolen horses which had been brought\r\nfrom the eastern part of the state.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Switzer, who had been indicted for burglary in 1840, was\r\ntransferred on a change of venue from Linn to Cedar county. It came up\r\nat the October term of the district court, Joseph Williams presiding.\r\nGeorge McCoy was sheriff and William Knott was his deputy. The\r\nfollowing named persons, all well known settlers, sat on this jury: C.\r\nKline, William Morgan, Elias Epperson, Abe Kiser, Porter McKinstry, P.\r\nWilkinson, J. S. Lewis, John Lewis, William Denny, W. H. Bolton, Peter\r\nDiltz, and Samuel Gilliland.\r\n\r\nConsiderable excitement prevailed at this trial. Switzer was\r\nrepresented by able counsel who put up a great defense. Mrs. McElheny\r\nand other members of the family unmistakably identified Switzer as the\r\nperson who had been there before to borrow the money and who was one of\r\nthe leaders on the night of the robbery. Switzer tried to prove an\r\nalibi, and had a number of people who swore that he had been at another\r\nplace on the night of the robbery. It is said that the jury was out two\r\ndays and two nights and during this deliberation Switzer tried to\r\napproach Knott by saying that he wanted help and that as soon as Knott\r\nfound out the jury had found him guilty he asked him to give him some\r\nsign by taking a handkerchief out of his pocket. What he would have\r\nattempted then is not known. Knott refused, the jury disagreed, eleven\r\nstanding for conviction and one for acquittal.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial a large grey horse was hitched in front of the\r\nbuilding used as a court house, for what purpose no one ever\r\nunderstood, nor did any one know who was the owner of the horse.\r\nSwitzer had a number of friends who hung around the jury and around the\r\ncourt house during the trial. As the jury came out one of the jurors\r\nhad a handkerchief protruding from the side pocket of his coat. Switzer\r\nrecognized the signal. With the nimbleness and quickness of a bare back\r\nrider he jumped on to the horse and darted away like a cyclone. Knowing\r\nthe proposition Switzer made to Knott there seems to be some reason to\r\nbelieve that this member of the jury had given Switzer the sign. When\r\nthe jury reported they were unable to agree, Switzer's friends started\r\nout to find and convey to him the result, but could not find him until\r\nthe day following, when they found him concealed among some of the\r\ntimber along Sugar creek.\r\n\r\nAnother warrant was issued for his arrest, but there was some delay in\r\nserving this notice and in the meantime he made his escape. In 1852\r\nWilliam Knott was in California and there met Switzer at Carson river\r\nin Nevada territory and had a conversation with him. Switzer admitted\r\nthat he had been in a very tight place when he was under arrest in\r\nCedar county, and he asked Knott to convey his best wishes to the juror\r\nwho had hung out in his favor. Mr. Knott ascertained that Switzer's\r\nmorals had not changed any on account of his removal. In 1874 Judge\r\nJohn Shane and his wife visited California, and upon inquiry at Vallejo\r\nascertained that Switzer lived in that vicinity, and although a very\r\ndissolute and reckless man and feared by all, he had accumulated a\r\nhandsome fortune. He also discovered that the sons were following in\r\nthe footsteps of their father, and that one of them was under\r\nindictment for having killed a man.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Switzer arrest and trial for the Gilbert robbery a\r\ncivil suit had also been brought against him for the recovery of the\r\nmoney and a judgment was obtained. Judge Shane consulted an attorney\r\nand tried to get a transcript of his judgment in order to collect the\r\nsame, but for some reason the records could not be found and the\r\njudgment could not be transcripted. Switzer died in California in 1877.\r\n\r\nOne of Switzer's best friends and a hanger-on at the court, a\r\ndesperado, surrounded by a number of fellows of the same type, was\r\nChristopher Burns. He carried revolvers and bowie knives and wore a\r\ngentleman's cloak of the old style thrown loosely about his shoulders.\r\nThe sheriff, his deputy, and a number of men surrounding them also\r\ncarried arms, and in case the jury had returned a verdict of \"guilty\"\r\nit was Burns's intention, no doubt, to rescue his friend and a bloody\r\nbattle would have taken place. Burns left the country immediately and\r\nwas shot by a neighbor in a quarrel on the upper Missouri river in\r\n1845.\r\n\r\nThe whipping of McBroom, Case, and others, and the arrest of Switzer\r\nand his flight put a stop to these outrages, so from 1841 to 1855,\r\nwhile many suspicious persons still lived in the community, they were\r\nmore guarded in their movements than before, and these desperate acts\r\ndid not take place, although for many years after this a good horse was\r\nnot always safe property to keep in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\nFrom _History of Linn County_, 1878\r\n\r\nIt seems that the first store was located at Westport where there was a\r\nbarter trade carried on with Indians. W. H. Merritt ran a store at\r\nIvanhoe in 1838, which was located on the government road. John Henry\r\nseems to have operated the store at Westport, but whether he bought\r\nthis from Wilbert Stone is uncertain. It is stated that William, or\r\nWilbert, Stone, sold his store or had one at Westport about 1837 where\r\nhe did some trading with the Indians. He must have been there as early\r\nas 1837 because he sold out his interest to John Henry and removed\r\nfurther up to what became Cedar Rapids, and had been living there for\r\nsome time when Robert Ellis found him on the west side of the river\r\nupon his arrival in May, 1838.\r\n\r\nNone of the land at that time had been surveyed, so all the rights the\r\npeople had were known as \"squatter\" rights, which they sold as any\r\nother land, and which would give them the privilege of filing on it\r\nwhen the land would get into the market. Much of this land was handled\r\nthat way. The southeastern and eastern part of the county were first\r\nsettled, and then settlements were made along the Cedar river, which\r\nwould be natural for the reason that people had to use the river more\r\nor less in keeping in communication with other places.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give the names of all the early settlers for\r\nthe reason that some only remained a short time and moved away again\r\nand the names of these have been lost. A few only can be mentioned to\r\ngive the reader an idea of where and how certain towns were staked out\r\nand buildings commenced. The Linn county lands first came into the\r\nmarket in March, 1843, and not till then, did the settlers come in any\r\nlarge numbers. All were anxious to get free lands. The town sites were\r\nlaid out as follows, though they were only squatter's rights: Westport\r\nin July, 1838, by Israel Mitchell; Columbus (Cedar Rapids), September,\r\n1838, by William [or Wilbert] Stone; Ivanhoe, October, 1838, by Anson\r\nCowles; while the town site of Cedar Rapids was laid out by N. B. Brown\r\nand others August 4, 1841. The first plat, however, recorded was by the\r\nfather of Elias Doty. This was recorded after the land had come into\r\nmarket, when Westport was re-named Newark, and was filed November 12,\r\n1844.\r\n\r\nThe tide of civilization gradually flowed westward from the Mississippi\r\nriver. The regular chain of progress is clearly shown, and forms a\r\nportion of the history of Linn county. Young men pushed bravely ahead,\r\nclaiming rights to unsurveyed lands, expecting in a short time a rise\r\nin values and big money in their holdings. Many of these men were\r\nsingle and never intended to make this, or any other community, their\r\npermanent home. All they wanted was to pick out the best claims, erect\r\nshacks, hold them down until men with families came, who had a little\r\nmoney and were willing to pay so as to get a home at once. Many of\r\nthese young venturesome spirits frequently in six months or a year\r\nwould pick up from $500.00 to a couple of thousand for a claim,\r\ndepending somewhat upon the improvements made. At times these squatters\r\nwould erect fairly good log houses and stables, and dig a well or two,\r\nand would also put in a little garden stuff--potatoes and the like--so\r\nas to keep the family partly, at least, over winter. Crops and all\r\nimprovements would go with the bargain. Many of these men drifted\r\nfarther westward and undoubtedly lived nearly all their lives on what\r\nmight be known as the border land of civilization. They preferred this\r\nkind of life, and whenever a community was settled up it lost all\r\ninterest for the original pioneer; he wanted and preferred to live\r\namong frontier ruffians; would fight if he had to, and would always\r\ndefend himself against any intruder. These men enjoyed this kind of a\r\nlife and thrived upon it, and all they cared for was a little money,\r\ngood times, and the freedom they so much craved and which the frontier\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\n\"While it is true that those who located in this county in the years\r\n1837 and 1838 came from the east, it is also certain that this section\r\nwould not have been reached so early in this century had the lands\r\nimmediately west of the Mississippi been unselected. It was, and still\r\nis, the desire of genuine pioneers to find a spot beyond the confines\r\nof civilization, no matter how crude the outlying stations may be.\"\r\n\r\nThe first settlement of whites in Iowa had been at Dubuque, where\r\nDubuque and his followers worked the mines at that place. This at one\r\ntime was a great center of attraction, but as the government restricted\r\nsettlers from coming in, they were driven back until treaty\r\narrangements were made with the Indians, who were the owners of the\r\nland upon which the mines were located. These men who first came as\r\nminers early saw the exceeding beauty and fertility of the Iowa lands,\r\nand thus news was spread among the people of the east before the Iowa\r\nlands were thrown open for settlement. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were\r\nby this time pretty much settled up, and so was Missouri and nearly all\r\nthe land adjoining the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Thus it was that as\r\nsoon as the word came from the government that part of Iowa was thrown\r\nopen to settlement adventurous men and brave women soon began to cross\r\nthe Mississippi and to settle in various parts of what was then so well\r\nknown as the Black Hawk land. There were no roads in those days, not\r\neven trails, and consequently a person did not dare to venture out on\r\nthe prairie, but he generally followed some stream so that he could\r\nfind his way back to the starting place, at least.\r\n\r\nMost of the people who came west to settle had no idea of where to\r\nlocate or of the condition of the Iowa lands. They were bold, fearless,\r\nand determined, as well as resolute, and they pushed on until they\r\nfound a locality which suited their fancy and here they pitched their\r\ntents and lived in their wagons until suitable log cabins were erected.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1829 there was not even a ferry established at any regular\r\npoint on which to cross the river into Iowa; even the miner, Dubuque,\r\nwhen he wanted to re-cross to the Illinois side had to borrow an Indian\r\ncanoe. The familiar Du Bois, who came early into Illinois in Joe Davies\r\ncounty, trading with the Indians, had no other means of crossing the\r\nriver than in Indian canoes. By the latter part of 1829 one John Barrel\r\nwas commissioned to maintain a ferry at Rock Island, which at that time\r\nwas within the confines of Joe Davies county, which extended for miles\r\nand miles along the river, like Dubuque county on the west side of the\r\nriver. Col. George Davenport also obtained a permit to run a ferry from\r\nDavenport across the river, the ferry charges being fixed by the\r\ncommissioners so that there could be no hold-up. The following charges\r\nwere made, which must have been pretty high for the people of small\r\nmeans in those days:\r\n\r\n     Man and horse                                       $25.00\r\n     Horses or cattle, per head, other than cattle yoke     .37-1/2\r\n     Road wagon                                            1.00\r\n     For each horse hitched to said wagon                   .25\r\n     Each two-horse wagon                                   .75\r\n     Each two-wheeled carriage or cart                     1.00\r\n     One-horse wagon                                        .75\r\n     Each hundred weight of mdse., etc.                     .06\r\n\r\nTo avoid paying this ferry charge a great many of the settlers started\r\nearly in the spring and would cross the river on the ice and thus save\r\nthis additional expense. William Abbe and his family, and many others\r\nwho settled in Linn county, at least those who were familiar with the\r\nferry charges, crossed on the ice.\r\n\r\nGeorge Davenport established a trading post as early as 1831 at the\r\nmouth of Rock creek, and another on the east side of Cedar river just\r\nabove Rochester a short time later. Thus, gradually, there extended a\r\nsystem of small stores in the bayous, creeks, and rivers where trading\r\nwas carried on mainly with the Indians. The settlers who came generally\r\nfollowed these trails and would be helped and advised where to go and\r\nwhere to find the best roads, and also as to whether or not the Indians\r\nin the immediate vicinity of the stores were hostile or friendly.\r\n\r\nBlock houses had also been erected near these frontier stores for\r\nprotection in case of Indian outbreaks.\r\n\r\nAnother trading point was that of Rockingham which was laid out as\r\nearly as 1835, and in the early forties considered one of the best\r\nvillages in the territory. It was to this place the early settlers came\r\nup to 1841-42 to trade, as well as to Muscatine and Davenport.\r\n\r\nThe settlers who came late during the summer of 1838-39 were\r\nunfortunate in case they were unable to get enough hay for their stock,\r\nfor the winters were very cold and there were no provisions or food to\r\nbe purchased, and many a family along the Cedar river in Linn and Cedar\r\ncounties during these years endured some severe trials. Money was\r\nscarce, provisions of all kinds high, and no trading posts nearer than\r\nthose at Davenport, Muscatine, and Rockingham. It is said that Robert\r\nEllis and Philip Hull came to William Abbe's on their way to Muscatine\r\nto get provisions in the fall of 1838. William Abbe gave them\r\n$15.00--all the money he had--and with tears in his eyes told them to\r\nbuy what they could, for that he did not know what would become of his\r\nwife and children when that was gone, for it was all the money he had\r\nin the world. They were absent about two weeks, and brought back as\r\nmuch provisions as they could buy with what money they had, and by\r\nhunting during the winter they got along and helped William Abbe. In\r\nthe forties William Abbe secured government contracts, and then became\r\na well-to-do man. Robert Ellis was a partner with Abbe many times in\r\nsupplying the outposts with provisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINN COUNTY SCENES]\r\n\r\nMany families during the latter thirties and the early forties\r\nexperienced some hard times in Iowa. To make the situation and\r\nsurroundings still more difficult the creeks and sloughs between the\r\nsettlements were treacherous quagmires in which wagons going for or\r\nreturning with provisions were sure to settle in up to the hubs, and\r\nwhen once in the mud there was no way to get them out except by\r\nunloading or by going to the nearest store for help, which would be\r\nmany miles away. Sometimes the assistance of two or three additional\r\nyoke of oxen was secured to pull out the wagon.\r\n\r\nThe winters of 1837-38-39 and 40 began early, snow falling to the\r\nextent of a foot or two as early as the latter part of October, and it\r\nincreased as the winter advanced. There was no thaw in January, and the\r\nsettlers were completely shut in until about the middle of April. Then\r\nthe snow all melted away and the streams were swollen so as to be\r\nimpassable. Thus it was impossible to get to any place for food or for\r\nprovisions until way into the summer. Consequently the settlers\r\nexperienced many hardships, and much of the stock died from sheer\r\nstarvation. As early as possible in the spring the settlers would unite\r\nand start off for Muscatine, Dubuque, or Rockingham for provisions, and\r\non their return would help the needy settlers who had no opportunity to\r\nget away. Sometimes these journeys were undertaken on foot, when two or\r\nthree would start off with knapsacks to get the necessary foods and\r\nmedicines, and would return as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful what the old settlers endured--how they walked a\r\ndistance of 100 miles in less than two days. Robert Ellis walked from\r\nMichigan to Iowa; he walked to Dubuque, Muscatine, Davenport, and\r\nBurlington many times, while it is said of William Abbe that he walked\r\neasily 60 miles a day without being very much exhausted. Then, again,\r\nwhen roads were impassable for wheeled vehicles they would ride\r\nhorseback, leading sometimes one horse to be used as a pack horse to\r\nbring back provisions.\r\n\r\nTo show with how much difficulty the early settlers toiled to get a\r\nfoothold in Linn county, it might be well to state the story of the\r\nlife of Edward M. Crow, who, as a young man, in 1837 came into the\r\ncounty to a place near where is now located Viola. He was only 21 years\r\nof age, and came west from Chicago, having previously come from\r\nIndiana. He stopped first in Illinois and having heard of Iowa, came\r\nhere in search of cheap land. He was accompanied by James Dawson and\r\nJames Gillilan, the latter owning a team of horses. They constructed\r\nferry boats of their own on which to cross the river. The other two\r\nparties got tired and left. Crow later found Dawson in Illinois. They\r\ntravelled over much of Iowa, back and forth, mostly on foot; sometimes\r\ntogether, sometimes setting out in different directions alone. Finally,\r\nboth Dawson and Crow united in Jones county, staking out a claim in\r\nLinn county in July, 1837. Returning to Fox river, Illinois, again in\r\nquest of provisions, they did not come back to Linn county until in\r\nAugust of that year, when Ed and Garrison Crow and James Dawson began\r\ntheir settlement, erected a cabin and cut some hay for the winter. They\r\nwere without food, and had to make another trip to the borders of\r\ncivilization for provisions for the winter. The monotonous months of\r\nwinter rolled by, Crow's party subsisting by hunting as best they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nA number of settlers came into Brown township during the early years,\r\nsuch as Jacob Mann, David Mann, his brother, William P. Earle, Asa\r\nFarnsworth, and many others. John Crow, father of Ed Crow, John Lynn,\r\nO. Bennett, Charles Pickney, Benj. Simmons, Solomon Peckham, and\r\nAlexander Rhotan were emigrants who settled here in 1838. All those who\r\ncame that year and have been definitely corroborated, or who were\r\nthere as real settlers, were the following: Samuel C. Stewart, Peter\r\nMcRoberts, John Afferty, William Abbe, Israel Mitchell, Will Gilbert,\r\nJ. G. Cole, Hiram Thomas, Joseph Carraway, Jacob Leabo, John Henry, J.\r\nWilbert Stone, Osgood Shepherd, wife, father and several children,\r\nRobert Ellis, O. S. Bolling, Mr. Ashmore, W. K. Farnsworth, Robert\r\nOsborn, Thomas Campbell, Perry Oxley, Will Vineyard, James Hunter, J.\r\nJ. Gibson, Robert Deem, Michael Donahoo, William Chamberlain, Mr.\r\nWilliams, Mr. Evans, J. B. Sargent, John Sargent, A. J. McKean, John\r\nScott, H. W. Gray, S. H. Tryon, Anson Coles, Andrew Safely, Rev.\r\nChristian Troup, D. S. Hahn, Hiram Bales, Asher Edgerton, Peter Roland,\r\nJohn Stewart, J. E. Boyd, Philip Hull, John Young, Mr. Granger, L. H.\r\nPowell, John McCloud, Mr. Kemp, Listebarger brothers, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe Hoosier Grove settlement was made in 1838, being in Putnam\r\ntownship; Isaac and Abner Cox and John Holler, and several others,\r\nsettled here that year.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1839 Otter Creek was settled by Stevens, Michael\r\nGreene, Bart McGonigle, Henry Nelson, William Chamberlain, Dr. J.\r\nCummings, Will Sullivan and Perry Oliphant.\r\n\r\nDyer Usher and Joel Howard ferried people across the Mississippi near\r\nMuscatine in the summer of 1839. These men died near Covington a few\r\nyears ago. Usher always claimed that he was on the site of Cedar Rapids\r\nas early as 1836 and located west of the river two years later. The\r\nyoung men could make no money in a new country, and while they took\r\nclaims they frequently left for civilization to earn a little money. So\r\nit might have been that Usher was a bona fide resident of Linn county,\r\nwhile he could get no employment nearer than Muscatine.\r\n\r\nA number of persons settled early around Cedar Rapids in the timber a\r\nfew miles from town. William Knowles located on what is known as Mound\r\nFarm in 1839 and gave this up to the Brodie family, consisting of\r\nparents, five sons and three daughters. The names of the sons were\r\nHugh, John, William, Steven, and Jesse. Rev George R. Carroll speaks of\r\nthe family as having an unsavory reputation. The family removed further\r\nnorth when some of them at least were accused of being notorious horse\r\nthieves.\r\n\r\nJoel Leverich next became the owner of Mound Farm, a person who had\r\nsomewhat of a history in the early days of politics in the county. In\r\n1843-44 this property was purchased by George Greene.\r\n\r\nA number of people lived along the trail between Marion and Cedar\r\nRapids. Among those well known not already mentioned may be named\r\nAmbrose Harlan, Dave Woodbridge, J. E. Bromwell, J. P. Glass, Rufus\r\nLucore, John and Will Hunter, Thomas Hare, Will Willis, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe quote the following from directories and gazeteers published years\r\nago. These statements may not be correct in some details, but the facts\r\nwere obtained from some who were doubtless familiar with them.\r\n\r\nThus Wolfe in his Cedar Rapids and Kingston directory of 1869 speaks of\r\nJohn Mann, of Pine Grove, as the first settler in Linn county, he\r\ncoming in 1838, and of the first marriage in the county as that of\r\nSarah Haines to Richard Osborne, in 1839, and the first death as that\r\nof Mrs. Haines, an elderly lady who died from an accident in July,\r\n1838.\r\n\r\nHe further speaks of the first store in Westport as that of Albert\r\n[should be John] Henry in 1838. It is thought that Stone also carried\r\non some store or trade with the Indians before this. He speaks of the\r\nsecond store as being operated by W. H. Merritt in 1839. This should be\r\n1838, as is seen from Merritt's letter to S. W. Durham, found in\r\nanother portion of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe first claim of land in Cedar Rapids was made by William Stone, in\r\n1838, who built a cabin on the banks of the river on Commercial street,\r\nnow First street. Is this the Shepherd cabin, and was this so-called\r\nfirst tavern erected and occupied by Stone, who later was compelled to\r\nvacate it and give up his claim? Mr. Wolfe also speaks of the first saw\r\nand grist mill built by Brown in 1842, the second flour mill built by\r\nAlex Ely in 1845, and the first woolen factory erected by Brown in\r\n1845. Miss Legare built a saw mill in 1851.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1869 Wolfe speaks of eight flour and saw mills being\r\noperated in and around Cedar Rapids. He speaks further of two woolen\r\nfactories and the steam bakery of I. H. Shaver & Co., and of the Fish\r\npaper mill, manufacturing 300 tons of paper annually. The directory\r\nspeaks of the American Express Company having an office here as early\r\nas 1859, with W. B. Mack as the first local agent.\r\n\r\nThe editor also mentions that the learned professions were represented\r\nby ten clergymen, thirteen doctors, and about fifteen lawyers.\r\n\r\nHe also mentions J. Bell's stage line running daily between Iowa City,\r\nSolon, Western, and Cedar Rapids, and also of a line to Vinton.\r\n\r\nThe following as seen by a traveller may be of interest. It is from _A\r\nGlimpse of Iowa in 1846_, by J. B. Newhall, Burlington, Iowa, _W. D.\r\nSkillman_, publisher, 1846:\r\n\r\n     \"Linn county has become proverbial for the excellence of its\r\n     soil, its salubrity of climate, abundance and admirable\r\n     adaption of woodlands to the wants and convenience of the\r\n     settler. The prairies are remarkably fertile, and of\r\n     moderate extent; the timber equally and amply apportioned,\r\n     generally of full growth, consisting, principally, of red\r\n     and white oak, black and white walnut, linn, sugar, maple,\r\n     etc. Linn county is famous for its extensive sugar orchards,\r\n     from some of which 500 to 1,000 weight have been annually\r\n     made. It is well watered by the Red Cedar and its\r\n     tributaries, affording abundance of mill power, much of\r\n     which is already improved.\r\n\r\n     \"Marion, the seat of justice, is located near the center of\r\n     the county, about four miles east of the Cedar, at the edge\r\n     of a beautiful grove, on a gentle prairie roll. It contains\r\n     several stores, a commodious hotel, postoffice, various\r\n     mechanical establishments, and is a place of considerable\r\n     importance.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern traveler speaks of broad meadows, of rich corn fields, and\r\nof large manufacturing interests. This traveler of sixty-five years ago\r\nspeaks of timber which has disappeared and of maple sugar orchards\r\nwhich makes us wonder what they were like.\r\n\r\nFrom Bailey & Hair's _Iowa State Gazetteer_, 1865, we gather these\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\n     \"The county of Linn is so named in honor of a distinguished\r\n     senator of the United States, the Hon. Louis F. Linn, of\r\n     Missouri. It is situated centrally in the eastern half of\r\n     the state, and from fifty to sixty miles west of the\r\n     Mississippi river.\r\n\r\n     \"It was defined by act of the Territorial Legislature of\r\n     Wisconsin, at its session of 1837 and '38; that Territory\r\n     then including the whole of Iowa within its jurisdiction.\r\n     The county limits were the same as they now remain,\r\n     consisting of twenty Congressional townships, containing an\r\n     area of 720 square miles. It is bounded on the north by\r\n     Buchanan and Delaware counties, east by Jones and Cedar,\r\n     south by Johnson and west by Benton. It is now divided into\r\n     nineteen civil townships, as follows: Bertram, Boulder,\r\n     Brown, Buffalo, Clinton, College, Fairfax, Franklin,\r\n     Fayette, Jackson, Linn, Marion, Maine, Monroe, Otter Creek,\r\n     Putnam, Rapids, Spring Grove, and Washington.\r\n\r\n     \"The county was duly organized by the Board of County\r\n     Commissioners at their first session held September 9th,\r\n     1839, at the farm house of Mr. James W. Willis, one-half\r\n     mile north of the present town of Marion. The board\r\n     consisted of Samuel C. Stewart, President, Peter McRoberts,\r\n     and Luman M. Strong, Commissioners; Hosea W. Gray, Sheriff;\r\n     and John C. Berry, Clerk.\r\n\r\n     \"This Board also approved the selection of the county seat,\r\n     which they ordered to be called Marion; divided the county\r\n     into election and road districts; and appointed Andrew J.\r\n     McKean and William H. Smith, Constables. Of the officers and\r\n     persons above named, but two, Messrs. Gray and McKean,\r\n     remain residents of the county, the latter being the present\r\n     Clerk of the District Court.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The first white settler in this county was John Mann, who\r\n     erected his cabin on Upper Big Creek, in Linn Grove, in the\r\n     month of February, A. D., 1838. He was an emigrant from the\r\n     mountainous region of southwestern Pennsylvania. He was an\r\n     honest, industrious, unlettered, rude sort of man.\r\n     Subsequently he built a small flouring mill. A great flood\r\n     in the spring of 1851 carried away his mill and himself\r\n     together. The unfortunate man was drowned, and his body\r\n     recovered only after several days had elapsed. The flood was\r\n     unprecedented, and was thought to have been caused by a\r\n     water spout. The Little Creek is said to have risen twenty\r\n     feet in about as many minutes.\r\n\r\n     \"The next permanent settler was John Crow, a North\r\n     Carolinian, who made his home near the east line of the\r\n     county on the Wapsipinicon river, in April, 1838. He was a\r\n     very gentlemanly person, of more than ordinary intelligence,\r\n     wealth and enterprise. He died about five years afterwards,\r\n     much respected. His son, Edward Crow, Esq., now a member of\r\n     the Board of Supervisors of this County, and other\r\n     descendants remain. During the summer of 1838 the\r\n     settlements gradually extended in the east part of the\r\n     county. The only persons now recollected, of that early\r\n     period, as remaining, are John Gibson, of Mount Vernon, and\r\n     Andrew J. McKean, and Hosea W. Gray, of Marion. The first\r\n     family west of Big Creek was that of Jacob Leabo, from\r\n     Kentucky. The first west of Indian Creek was that of James\r\n     W. Bassett, from Vermont. The first Justice of the Peace was\r\n     John McAfferty, commissioned in 1838. The first Judge of\r\n     Probate was Israel Mitchell, a Tennesseean, now residing in\r\n     Oregon. The first Sheriff was Hosea W. Gray. The first Clerk\r\n     of the District Court was Joseph Williams, a Pennsylvanian:\r\n     now said to be in the military service at Memphis,\r\n     Tennessee.\r\n\r\n     \"The first officiating minister was the Rev. Christian\r\n     Troup, a German Lutheran, who preached regularly in his own\r\n     cabin near the mouth of Spring Creek every Sunday during the\r\n     latter part of the summer of 1838. The first marriage was\r\n     that of Richard Osborn and Sarah Haines, in the spring of\r\n     1839. The first birth was that of a daughter of Mrs. Samuel\r\n     McCartney, in July, 1838. The first death was that of Mrs.\r\n     Haines, an invalid elderly lady, who died from the effects\r\n     of an accidental fall in July, 1838. The second was that of\r\n     James Logan, an Irishman, who was killed by the caving in of\r\n     a well which he was excavating in Marion, July, 1840.\r\n\r\n     \"The first selected town site was called Westport, of which\r\n     Israel Mitchell was proprietor. It was near the present site\r\n     of the village of Bertram, and was selected in July, 1838.\r\n     This was afterwards abandoned. The next in order of time,\r\n     was called Columbus, built by William Stone, in September,\r\n     1838. He abandoned his town the next spring, there being\r\n     only a single log cabin. The site was that occupied by the\r\n     present city of Cedar Rapids. The next was Ivanhoe, by Anson\r\n     Cowles, in October, 1838, since vacated. The fourth was\r\n     Marion, the present county seat, in April, 1839.\r\n\r\n     \"The first election was held at Westport in October, 1838,\r\n     that being the only poll opened for the county. The only\r\n     candidates were for members of the Assembly; thirty-two\r\n     votes were cast. The first member of the General Assembly\r\n     elected from this county was the Hon. George Greene, member\r\n     of the Legislative Council, elected in 1840. The first store\r\n     opened was at Westport, by Albert [John] Henry, in the fall\r\n     of 1838. The second at Ivanhoe, in the spring of 1839, by\r\n     Col. William H. Merritt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOING SHOPPING IN THE EARLY DAYS FROM CARROLLS'S PIONEER\r\nHISTORY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN BOYS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN TEPEE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATER INDIAN HOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN GRAVE]\r\n\r\n     \"The first celebration was on the 4th of July, 1839, at\r\n     Westport, Judge Mitchell, Orator. There was a dinner,\r\n     toasts, and a ball, whereof William H. Smith, Andrew J.\r\n     McKean and H. W. Gray, were managers.\r\n\r\n     \"The fifth decennial census of the United States was taken\r\n     in 1840, in this county, by H. W. Gray, Deputy Marshal. The\r\n     population was 1,342. The influx of settlers for the next\r\n     three years was quite rapid, during which time the\r\n     population reached probably three thousand. The largest\r\n     proportion of the emigration was of Southern origin. The\r\n     early settlers were plain, honest, hospitable people, not\r\n     much accustomed to legal restraints, and rather impatient of\r\n     the slow process and technicalities of the law. As usual, in\r\n     all new countries, they were annoyed by vagabonds, who\r\n     flocked into the settlements, calculating on impunity in\r\n     their depredations, on account of the inefficiency of the\r\n     police regulations. A rude justice was not unfrequently\r\n     meted out to offenders without recourse to legal forms, or\r\n     the intervention of courts.\r\n\r\n     \"In common with all frontier settlements, the first settlers\r\n     here were poor; they were obliged to transport their produce\r\n     in wagons mostly, to the Mississippi River, at points sixty\r\n     or seventy miles distant. When reached at such disadvantage\r\n     the markets were very low, consequently the accretions of\r\n     wealth were slow, and were mainly invested in the homestead\r\n     of the farmer. The discovery of gold in California with the\r\n     resulting emigration, opened a good market for the farmers\r\n     at home. Afterwards, eastern emigration, with the building\r\n     of railroads, connecting the people with eastern markets,\r\n     greatly accelerated the prosperity of this county as well as\r\n     all other parts of the west. The financial crisis of 1857\r\n     interposed a check to this onward career of prosperity. It\r\n     was but temporary, however, and the people had fully\r\n     regained their former standing when the rebellion commenced.\r\n\r\n     \"It is felt that a county which contributed one general, and\r\n     fifteen field officers, with more than two thousand\r\n     volunteers in defense of the Union, without draft or\r\n     conscription, and without seriously lessening its productive\r\n     energies, has an assured basis of future greatness and\r\n     prosperity. A basis which nothing short of the entire\r\n     upheaval and destruction of the foundations of human society\r\n     shall be able to disturb.\"\r\n\r\nIn _Guide, Gazetteer and Directory of the Dubuque & Sioux City\r\nRailroad_, Dubuque, _Bailey & Wolfe_, 1868, we read of Cedar Rapids:\r\n\r\n     \"The first settlement here was made in the year 1838 by\r\n     William Stone, who erected a log cabin on the bank of the\r\n     river in the rear of No. 1 North Commercial street. The same\r\n     year Osgood Shepherd, a supposed leader of a band of\r\n     outlaws, jumped Stone's claim and took possession of the\r\n     cabin, and held it until the year 1841, when he sold\r\n     three-fourths of his interest to N. B. Brown and George\r\n     Greene, H. W. Gray, A. L. Roach, and S. H. Tryon, for the\r\n     sum of $3,000.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1842 he sold the remainder and soon after disappeared\r\n     from the country. N. B. Brown came here in 1840, when Mr.\r\n     Brown and Judge George Greene became proprietors of the\r\n     water power.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1841 the town was laid out and named from the rapids in\r\n     the river. The first frame dwelling was erected by John\r\n     Vardy and is still standing at 62 Brown street, corner of\r\n     South Adams. The building known as the Old Postoffice\r\n     Building, North Washington street, was built for a store by\r\n     N. B. Brown, the same year. P. W. Earle's residence, 29 Iowa\r\n     Avenue, was the first brick building, and was erected by Mr.\r\n     Earle in 1849. Wm. Dwyer built the first hotel in 1847. This\r\n     was destroyed by fire in January, 1865.\r\n\r\n     \"The work of constructing a dam across the river, was\r\n     commenced by N. B. Brown, July 4th, 1842, though much of the\r\n     material had been prepared prior to that date. Mr. Brown\r\n     commenced the erection of a saw mill, and also of a grist\r\n     mill the same year, and both were completed the year\r\n     following. A second saw mill was built in 1851.\r\n\r\n     \"The second flouring mill was built by Alexander Ely in\r\n     1844-5. The first woolen factory was also built by N. B.\r\n     Brown in 1847. In 1855 a city charter was obtained, and at\r\n     the first charter election, Isaac N. Whittam was elected\r\n     Mayor. Railroad communication with the Mississippi was\r\n     opened in 1859, from which time the growth of the city in\r\n     wealth and population has been rapid and constant.\r\n\r\n     \"A superior water power has attracted a large interest in\r\n     manufactures of various kinds. As early as 1840 one of the\r\n     first settlers determined to apply his energies to the\r\n     improvement of the water power, and soon after a dam was\r\n     thrown across the river, a saw mill built, and other\r\n     improvements followed, till now there are located here five\r\n     flouring and custom mills, one saw mill, one paper mill, two\r\n     woolen mills, and one fanning mill and separator\r\n     manufactory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_William Abbe, the First Settler in the County_\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Abbe, we believe, was the first white settler to locate a claim\r\nwithin the boundaries of Linn county. He came as early as the summer of\r\n1836, from near Elyria, Lorain county, Ohio, seeking a location, coming\r\nvia Rock Island. He followed the Red Cedar river as far as the present\r\nsite of Mount Vernon, where he staked out a claim adjoining a little\r\ncreek, which to this day goes by the name of \"Abbe's Creek.\" He\r\nreturned to his home in Ohio and in the winter of 1837 he again crossed\r\nthe Mississippi with his family on the ice as early as February of that\r\nyear, according to his daughter's statement, and in April reached the\r\nlocation he had selected the previous year on Abbe's creek. Here he\r\nerected one of the first cabins in the county, being about 12×14 feet\r\nsquare, and covered with birch bark, having no floor. In this little\r\ncabin the family lived all summer. In the fall he erected a large\r\ndouble log house with three large rooms and an upstairs which was\r\nreached by a ladder from within. On this creek the family lived for\r\nfive years where Mr. Abbe owned four hundred acres. He disposed of this\r\nfarm and removed a short distance south of Marion where he purchased\r\nanother farm where he lived till he removed to Marion.\r\n\r\nWilliam Abbe was born in Connecticut April 19, 1800, being of English\r\ndescent. When a young boy he removed to the state of New York. He was\r\nmarried to Olive Greene in 1824 and by her had four children: Lucy,\r\nLois, Andrew, and Susan. Lois Abbe died young, Lucy Abbe died many\r\nyears ago, Andrew Abbe passed away at San Juan, California, in 1902,\r\nand Susan Abbe-Shields now resides at Hollister, California.\r\n\r\nWilliam Abbe brought his wife and children to Linn county in 1837; his\r\nwife died in 1839 and was buried in a cemetery located near the farm on\r\nwhich he settled, about two miles northwest of Mount Vernon. He married\r\na second time on September 13, 1840, his wife being Mary Wolcott, also\r\nfrom Ohio, and by her he had two sons, born at Marion: Augustus Wolcott\r\nAbbe and William Alden Abbe. William Alden Abbe died several years ago;\r\nhis widow and one child, a daughter, reside in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\r\nAugustus Wolcott Abbe, an old soldier, resides in Toledo, Iowa, and has\r\na family of eight children.\r\n\r\nMrs. Susan Shields was born in 1830 and was about seven years of age\r\nwhen she came to Linn county. She was married to John Harman March 16,\r\n1848, who died shortly afterwards, and she later married John Shields,\r\na resident of Vinton, Iowa. In an interesting letter on early Linn\r\ncounty days she writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"There were no white people for a long time after we landed\r\n     in Linn county; when they did come my mother used to let\r\n     them come and stay there until they would find a place to\r\n     suit them; it was always a free home for the immigrants.\r\n     When we first went there I was but a child seven years old.\r\n     The men I remember most were Robert Ellis, one of our first\r\n     acquaintances, and Asher Edgerton, the former being with us\r\n     a long time when the country was new. Of course we had men\r\n     come in, such as horse thieves, and my father had some of\r\n     them chained up in one of our rooms for safe keeping until\r\n     they could be tried, as there was no jail for some time in\r\n     Linn county.\r\n\r\n     \"I went with my father to Marion, a little place then with\r\n     one or two houses and a jail. We carried an iron trap door\r\n     for the jail; it was in two rooms, one upstairs and one\r\n     downstairs. There were two men in the dungeon at the time;\r\n     we took the door for this jail. My father was a justice of\r\n     the peace for awhile; he was also a member of the state\r\n     legislature when the capital was located at Iowa City. Later\r\n     father sold our place on Abbe's Creek and purchased another\r\n     on the old Marion road, of about three hundred acres,\r\n     further north; there was a lovely creek, a grove of maple\r\n     trees was on one side and a boundless prairie on the other\r\n     side. The Indians used to come in the spring of the year to\r\n     camp and make sugar; I have seen as many as five or six\r\n     hundred at a time camped near our house in the timber; they\r\n     always made it a camping ground at our place and they seemed\r\n     to be very fond of my father, who was kind to them and who\r\n     spoke and understood the Winnebago language.\r\n\r\n     \"I remember well the first time I went to Cedar Rapids with\r\n     my father; this was in the early '40s; there were five\r\n     hundred Winnebago Indians camped there at the time. I had\r\n     played with the Indians so much that I could talk the Indian\r\n     language as well as themselves, so they had me to talk for\r\n     them. There were only one or two white settlers there at the\r\n     time. By the way, I was the first school teacher they had in\r\n     Cedar Rapids; I think it was about in 1846; I still have the\r\n     certificate issued to me by Alexander Ely, who was\r\n     superintendent at the time. After residing on this place a\r\n     short time my father disposed of his farm and removed to\r\n     Marion; he also lived for some time at Dubuque where he held\r\n     a government position in the Land Office, I think. The\r\n     breaking out of the gold fever in 1849 caused him to get\r\n     excited and he left for California, leaving the family at\r\n     Marion.\r\n\r\n     \"My father was a born pioneer; although born in Connecticut\r\n     he went to New York when the country was new, and then to\r\n     Ohio, and later came to Iowa. In California he never mined\r\n     gold, but teamed and speculated; he was there about two\r\n     years, returning to Iowa in 1851, remaining in Iowa only a\r\n     short time when he returned to California with his son,\r\n     Andrew. My father died in Sacramento, California, February\r\n     15, 1854, when about to go to Iowa to bring his family to\r\n     California, and he is buried in Sacramento.\"\r\n\r\nThis interesting letter from a real Linn county pioneer more than\r\nseventy years of age gives only an idea of the hardships of pioneer\r\nlife, and what this woman has endured as a daughter and wife of the\r\nfirst settlers.\r\n\r\nWilliam Abbe's widow, Mary Wolcott, continued to reside in Marion with\r\nher family until August 27, 1861, when she died, universally respected\r\nby all who knew her.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbe was an old time democrat and as such was in the state senate\r\nsession, having the honor to appoint Robert Ellis postmaster of the\r\nsenate, as a reward of friendship and good will. Mr. Abbe also was a\r\njustice of the peace for some time, was appointed commissioner to\r\nlocate state roads, had the contract for the erection of the first jail\r\nat Marion, and was otherwise a very useful citizen. He was also master\r\nof the first Masonic lodge at Marion, and one of the best known and\r\nbest educated men in Linn county up to the time of his removal to\r\nCalifornia. For a number of years Mr. Abbe was the only person in the\r\ncounty having ready money, loaning the same to his friends for the\r\npurchase of their claims. He held government contracts for the delivery\r\nof meat and provisions to the Winnebago agency at Fort Atkinson and to\r\nthe troops at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and at other places, and\r\nthus was acquainted with many of the military officers in the Black\r\nHawk war and with the Indian chiefs and braves of the Winnebago tribe,\r\nas well as the Sac and Fox Indians. It is said that William Abbe\r\nconversed freely with the Winnebago Indians, and frequently acted as an\r\ninterpreter when matters of importance came up between members of the\r\ntribe and the white settlers; he was always a friend and protector of\r\nthe Indians and frequently helped them in securing their just rights\r\nwhen they had been robbed by the white free-booters, hunters and\r\ntrappers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORMER PASTORS UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH, LISBON]\r\n\r\nWilliam Abbe was a kind and generous man, and his home was always open\r\nto the people who came into Linn county at an early day to seek homes.\r\nIt is also said that Mrs. Abbe was an excellent cook and many of the\r\nold surveyors would ride several miles out of their way to get a meal\r\nat the Abbe homestead, for the latch string of the Abbe home was always\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbe rode horseback a great deal and would be gone for weeks at a\r\ntime, and while he was away the family lived quietly at home awaiting\r\nfor days for his return when provisions were frequently scarce and when\r\nthe snow drifts generally were large. During the first two seasons\r\nthere were very few crops grown, and consequently the father was kept\r\nbusy earning a livelihood, the family subsisting mostly on the chase.\r\nHe traded provisions with the Indians, at times bringing home large\r\nquantities of honey which was used as sugar in sweetening black coffee\r\nas well as in place of butter on the hard johnny cake.\r\n\r\nHis son, Augustus Abbe, born on Abbe's creek in 1841, later a member of\r\nthe 9th Iowa Infantry, now a retired farmer residing at Toledo, Iowa,\r\ntells the following of his father's life and history:\r\n\r\n     \"There was not a time in my life when I do not remember the\r\n     Indian children. I played with them constantly. Those were\r\n     my only playmates in the early days. I learned a little of\r\n     the Winnebago language, and got along very well. My half\r\n     sister, Susan, spoke it fluently, as well as my father. I\r\n     remember when I was about five or six years old a number of\r\n     Indians were gathered in our house and I climbed a post,\r\n     sitting on the same to watch the redskins race their horses.\r\n     One of the chiefs, one that had the most gaudy clothing on,\r\n     rode by very fast and picked me off the post and put me in\r\n     front on his saddle, going at full gallop; he rode a long\r\n     ways down through the prairie and my mother expressed much\r\n     anxiety, but my father came out and stood there and watched\r\n     for me to return. After awhile the Indian came back and put\r\n     me safely down in front of the house, to my mother's joy--I,\r\n     all the time laughing, thinking that I had had a good time.\r\n     The Indian said to my father, 'papoose no 'fraid.' That pony\r\n     ride I shall remember as long as I live.\r\n\r\n     \"I also remember my father going away for two or three weeks\r\n     at a time, and my mother fixing up his lunch for the\r\n     journey. He had a pair of saddle bags filled with papers and\r\n     other articles. I still remember when he put on moccasins,\r\n     overshoes, and a buffalo overcoat of some kind; he would\r\n     bundle up securely, kiss us good-bye and start off across\r\n     the prairie at full speed. Many a time I cried, as I wanted\r\n     to go along, but on these long journeys I was refused this\r\n     pleasure for my father would not neglect business even for\r\n     the sake of pleasing his son whom he loved dearly.\r\n\r\n     \"I also remember Robert Ellis, the Ashertons, Willitts,\r\n     Clarks, and many others who came to our house and talked way\r\n     into the night about trips they had taken over the wide\r\n     prairies of Iowa. Our cabin was full of people most of the\r\n     time; they would come in late in the night and in the\r\n     morning, much to my surprise, I would find a number of\r\n     people at breakfast, I not knowing when they came during the\r\n     night. I never knew or heard of my mother making any charge\r\n     for keeping anyone over night, whether they were strangers\r\n     or acquaintances, whether they were poor or rich made no\r\n     difference; whatever she had she would divide with a\r\n     traveller or other stranger who came to her hospitable home.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not know that my mother understood much of the Indian\r\n     language, but she was kind to them and the squaws used to\r\n     sit on our door steps more than once. She gave them food\r\n     that she had prepared, sweetened with honey which they liked\r\n     very much.\r\n\r\n     \"I remember going to Marion with my father many times when\r\n     it was a very small village with a jail which my father\r\n     always pointed out as having built. He also taught me that I\r\n     must do right or else I might have to stay in that jail or\r\n     some other jail if I did not. These lessons were certainly\r\n     deeply impressed on me for life. I remember, also, when we\r\n     removed from Marion to Dubuque. I think that was in 1847,\r\n     and we remained there for some time, but I think less than a\r\n     year, when we removed back to Marion. My father held a\r\n     government position there in the land office, I think.\r\n\r\n     \"My two uncles, Charles and Eliezar Abbe, resided in Ohio,\r\n     one later removing to Michigan. The latter visited my father\r\n     frequently. He was related, also, on his wife's side, to Ed\r\n     Clark, an early settler in Linn county. These men were much\r\n     taken up with the country and we had hoped that they would\r\n     come here to locate, but they did not.\r\n\r\n     \"I also, with my father, visited Cedar Rapids many times,\r\n     and I do not believe I was more than five or six years of\r\n     age, hardly that, when I first saw Cedar Rapids, where I was\r\n     much interested in the dam and the mills. The town then\r\n     consisted of a few log houses along the east bank of the\r\n     river. The remainder of the town was a mass of sand burrs,\r\n     weeds, and timber, and along Cedar Lake and along the river\r\n     large numbers of Indians were camped, especially up along\r\n     the Cedar Lake and along what is now known as McCloud's\r\n     Springs. In this locality several hundred Indians would camp\r\n     in the winter and spring of the year, trapping, hunting, and\r\n     trading skins with the whites for red clothing, guns, and\r\n     ammunition. They would hang around the flour mills during\r\n     the day time where there were always a lot of people\r\n     gathered.\r\n\r\n     \"My mother was a member of the Lutheran church, which church\r\n     she now and then attended, but there were not many churches\r\n     in that day. My father was not a church member.\r\n\r\n     \"I remember my sister, Susan, teaching one of the first\r\n     schools in Cedar Rapids, much to the satisfaction of the\r\n     members of our family. In politics my father was a stanch\r\n     democrat and an admirer of Andrew Jackson. He also became\r\n     acquainted with most of the officers who remained in the\r\n     west after the close of the Black Hawk war, on account of\r\n     his government employment in which he was engaged. He was\r\n     also personally acquainted with the persons who had charge\r\n     of the Winnebago school, as well as those in charge of Fort\r\n     Atkinson. Nearly all the people who rode horseback from Iowa\r\n     City to Dubuque came by way of Mount Vernon, and would\r\n     generally stop over night at our home. I remember my father\r\n     and the strangers talking over politics until way into the\r\n     night, and still remember many of these discussions as to\r\n     the future of Iowa and as to the political aspirations of\r\n     the various parties. My father took a lively interest in\r\n     politics, as well as in the development of the west, and\r\n     when it was settled up he had a longing for starting another\r\n     pioneer settlement. He used to say when the land was pretty\r\n     much taken that it was too close, he had to get away, as he\r\n     wanted more room. By training and environment he was a true\r\n     pioneer and full of enthusiasm for the upbuilding of a\r\n     pioneer country.\r\n\r\n     \"When he was away in California we were much interested in\r\n     his letters and we all wanted to go. When our father\r\n     returned we asked him all sorts of questions about the gold\r\n     camps of the west, and what he had experienced, and we spent\r\n     whole evenings listening to his conversations. He did not\r\n     take us at that time, but wanted to seek out an ideal\r\n     location and get settled before he took us out there. But\r\n     the day never came, and we never saw him again when he left\r\n     on his second trip to California in 1852. All that we knew\r\n     was that my mother received a letter from a Masonic order in\r\n     Sacramento that the order had taken care of him in his\r\n     sickness and had seen that he received a suitable burial. He\r\n     was sick only a short time and none of his old friends was\r\n     with him when he died. Robert Ellis came to Sacramento\r\n     looking for his old neighbor and heard to his sorrow that\r\n     his friend had died only a week before. He came into\r\n     Sacramento from the camps on the American river.\r\n\r\n     \"After my father's death my mother resided in Marion with\r\n     her family where she died August 27, 1861, at the age of\r\n     fifty-eight years. As I felt downhearted at the time I\r\n     joined the army and went to the front. November 29, 1865, I\r\n     was joined in marriage to Cynthia Walker, daughter of an old\r\n     Linn county pioneer.\r\n\r\n     \"My father was also sheriff of Linn county. However, of this\r\n     there does not seem to be any record, as I have been\r\n     informed. He may have been appointed sheriff to fill a\r\n     vacancy, or he may have been a deputy, I am not certain\r\n     about that, but I know he was acting, at least, in the\r\n     capacity of sheriff and caused the arrest of a number of\r\n     horse thieves and other alleged criminals. My father was\r\n     over six feet tall, straight as an arrow, rather slender,\r\n     but very active, and I never saw a horse that he could not\r\n     mount and ride at any time without the least effort.\r\n\r\n     \"We used cattle for plowing, but generally kept also several\r\n     horses, but these were used to drive and ride and not to\r\n     work very much.\r\n\r\n     \"I believe that among the early settlers of the '30s and\r\n     '40s my father had the good will of all law-abiding\r\n     citizens. He was affable to strangers and true as steel to\r\n     his friends, and was universally respected.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Abbe will be remembered as one of the most prominent of his day\r\nand generation in Linn county, for his kindness, his uprightness, his\r\nnever wavering from the path of right. Whether amid the influences of\r\nthe home circle or surrounded by the temptations of the mining camp, he\r\nwas always the same sturdy, upright citizen, wanting to do right and\r\nhelping his fellow men who were more unfortunate than himself.\r\n\r\nOne of his old and true friends, speaking of his long deceased friend,\r\nexpressed words of deepest feeling which can be only expressed in the\r\nwell known stanzas:\r\n\r\n     \"Green be the turf above thee,\r\n       Friend of my better days,\r\n     None knew thee but to love thee,\r\n       None named thee but to praise.\"\r\n\r\nWhile a great many are now of the opinion that William Abbe was the\r\nfirst actual settler within the confines of Linn county, a number are\r\nstill of the opinion that Daniel Seward Hahn was the first settler. He\r\ncame here, accompanied by his wife, Parmelia Epperson Hahn. John J.\r\nDaniels, an old settler in Linn county, and a son of Jeremiah Daniels,\r\nwho came to Linn county in 1844, was pretty good authority on the\r\nsubject of the early settlers. In a number of conversations had with\r\nhim on this subject and from what he wrote for the _Annals of Iowa_,\r\nVol. VI, p. 581, and for the Iowa _Atlas_, 1907, it is gathered that he\r\nwas of the opinion that Daniel Hahn was the first actual settler, at\r\nleast the members of the Hahn family, of whom there are a number still\r\nliving in Linn and adjoining counties, claim that their ancestor,\r\nDaniel Hahn, should be awarded the honor. In the _Annals of Iowa_ Mr.\r\nDaniels has the following:\r\n\r\n     \"Daniel Hahn and his brother-in-law, Charles Moberly, came\r\n     to Linn county in the spring of 1837, made a claim and built\r\n     a cabin upon it, did some breaking, and in August removed\r\n     with wife and five children from Mercer county, Illinois. At\r\n     this time there was no house in Linn county to his\r\n     knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThis, Mr. Daniels says, was the statement made to him and others in the\r\nlifetime of Daniel Hahn.\r\n\r\nThis may be true, that in the early day very little, if any, social\r\nintercourse was had among the early settlers and no one paid any\r\nattention to time or place, and it might be that Mr. Abbe, Mr. Hahn,\r\nand Mr. Crow might have settled at the same time, one never having\r\nknown that the others had located here.\r\n\r\nQuoting from Mr. Daniels's articles, the following might be stated:\r\n\r\n     \"Edward M. Crow came to the county in July, 1837, in company\r\n     with his brother, locating near Viola where they made a\r\n     claim and erected a shanty; they remained there only a few\r\n     days, returning to Fox river to obtain provisions, having\r\n     decided to locate in the county. In the latter part of\r\n     August Edward Crow and his brother and James Dawson began to\r\n     work on their new possessions; about this time there came\r\n     also two other pioneers by the name of Joslyn and Russell;\r\n     they remained in the crude cabin during the winter and their\r\n     time was spent mostly in hunting, tanning pelts and trading\r\n     with the Indians. Their cabin was erected at the edge of\r\n     what was known as the 'Big Woods' in Brown township.\"\r\n\r\nThus it would seem that William Abbe in point of time was the first\r\nactual white settler to locate a claim and later to settle on this\r\nclaim with his family, within the confines of Linn county. True,\r\nhunters and trappers may have been here earlier, but no actual _bona\r\nfide_ settler, as far as we have been able to ascertain. The testimony\r\nof Mrs. Susan Shields, a daughter still living, would seem to suffice\r\nas to the time when the great river was crossed and as to the time the\r\nfamily came to Linn county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HON. SAMUEL W. DURHAM Honored Pioneer]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_The County Seat Contests--First Railroad in the County_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe county seat of Linn county was established at Marion by a board of\r\ncommissioners consisting of Lyman Dillon, Ben Nye, and Richard Knott.\r\nAs the years rolled by the question arose as to the removal of the\r\ncounty seat to Cedar Rapids, where it seems that it was needed, being\r\nwhat was then known as the commercial metropolis of the county. The\r\npeople of Marion insisted that that city was the center. While there\r\nwas more or less feeling in the county over the county seat fight, the\r\nlegislature of Iowa in 1850-51 created the office of county judge,\r\nwhich was designed to and did succeed the former legislative bodies of\r\nthe several counties of the state. The judge had the same powers\r\npossessed by the board of supervisors which controlled the affairs of\r\nthe county later. Among the rights and privileges peculiar to the\r\noffice was that most important one of submitting to the people the\r\nquestion of raising money for the purpose of repairing and erecting\r\nbuildings for the use of the county officers. (See Code of 1851.)\r\n\r\nIn 1855 James M. Berry was county judge, and a shrewd fellow he was. In\r\npursuance of the law, and what he thought his duty, Judge Berry took\r\nsteps to erect a jail and a fireproof building for the use of the\r\ncounty officers. These buildings were contracted for by a firm at Mt.\r\nVernon, Ohio, in the spring of that year. Then the people arose in arms\r\nas to the high-handed methods of Judge Berry. Political questions were\r\nlost sight of in the court house struggle. Speakers were employed pro\r\nand con. Judge Berry's term of office expired January 1, 1856, and a\r\nsuccessor was to be elected in August of 1855. Marion put up Judge\r\nBerry for re-election, while Cedar Rapids put up Rev. Elias Skinner, a\r\nwell known Methodist preacher who had traveled about the county and who\r\nwas well known by everyone as an aggressive fighter and a man who\r\nbelieved in what he did and would have things his way if possible. The\r\ncanvass was in the aggregate with Judge Berry at 1,233 votes, while\r\nSkinner showed up with 993 votes, the judge being re-elected by a\r\nmajority of 240 votes, thereby affirming by a referendum vote his\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nReverend Skinner is still living at Waterloo, and not long ago the\r\nwriter had a conversation with him about this the most famous fight\r\nthat has ever occurred in Linn county over the removal of the court\r\nhouse. Mr. Skinner just laughed and said he put up a good fight, but\r\nthe other fellow had the votes.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 another court house fight was had, but the board held that\r\nbecause of many names of voters being on both petitions these petitions\r\nwere defective.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1872 another petition was brought out for the\r\nre-location of the court house and an endless number of names were\r\nagain filed pro and con. Much money was spent on both sides; again the\r\nCedar Rapids faction was beaten, some preliminary steps were taken for\r\nan appeal but the appeal was stricken from the docket.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt was made by Cedar Rapids for a change of location of\r\nthe court house a few years ago, and again the petitioners lost out,\r\nand that case has been pending on the court docket but no action has\r\nbeen taken, so that it has for the fourth time been lost, much to the\r\nsurprise of the citizens of Cedar Rapids and to the satisfaction of the\r\npeople of Marion and a large portion of the northern part of the county\r\nwho have always stood out for Marion in the fights on the re-location\r\nof the county seat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST RAILROAD IN LINN COUNTY\r\n\r\nWhile it may have been charged at times that Iowa was slow in getting\r\nin touch with railway builders, it must be borne in mind that the first\r\nrailroad to be built in the United States upon which a steam engine was\r\nused was constructed in 1829; but very little was done until about\r\n1833-34. By 1835 there were not over 100 miles of road in active\r\noperation within the confines of the entire country. Up to 1841 not a\r\nmile of track had been laid in any of the following states: Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan. By the end of 1848 there were only\r\ntwenty-two miles of tracks laid in Illinois, eighty-six in Indiana, and\r\nnone in Wisconsin or Missouri.\r\n\r\nTraffic so far had been exclusively by river, lake, canal, or in\r\nwagons. Much money had been expended in opening up rivers for steamboat\r\ntraffic and more or less had been voted to build roads and dig canals.\r\nBut over such a large stretch of country it was impossible for the\r\nnation to do much.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1837 many citizens of Iowa and others began to agitate for\r\na transcontinental line of railroad to run from the Atlantic states to\r\nthe Pacific, and for a grant of land by congress for this purpose. Asa\r\nWhitney, of New York, an able and public spirited man, had written much\r\nin the papers proposing such a project. There was of course at that\r\ntime more or less speculation as to just where such proposed railroad\r\nmight pass. The southern senators proposed a road through St. Louis and\r\nacross Missouri to Kansas. There was a spirit of rivalry at this time.\r\nWhen Chicago began to get its growth the far-sighted people of that\r\ncity saw that it would be in the interests of Chicago to have the line\r\ngo directly west and through Iowa, and thus cut out a dangerous rival.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago press henceforth always favored a direct route through\r\nIowa. As early as 1838 G. W. Jones, then delegate in congress from\r\nWisconsin, secured an appropriation of $10,000, which was expended in\r\nmaking a survey from Lake Michigan through southern Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nNow the people of Iowa became active. They wanted a railroad from the\r\nlakes west, and this could only be secured by public or state aid. The\r\nlegislature of 1844 joined in a petition to congress asking a grant of\r\npublic land to the Territory of Iowa to aid in the construction of a\r\nrailroad from Dubuque to Keokuk. The grant was to consist of alternate\r\nsections extending five miles in width on each of the proposed roads or\r\nits equivalent in adjacent government lands.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1844-45 a convention was held at Iowa City where\r\nnearly all the counties of the territory were represented by wide-awake\r\nyoung men in the interest of this railway promotion. Several proposed\r\nlines were agitated and as some of these lines did not start at any\r\nplace and went to no place many of these projects failed.\r\n\r\nThe first grant of public lands in Iowa for transportation was not for\r\nrailroads but for improving navigation on the Des Moines river. It was\r\nmade in 1846. Strong then was the prejudice against railway promotion,\r\nand little faith did the public men in congress put in this so-called\r\nwild speculation.\r\n\r\nThe people of Iowa were so enthusiastic in the way of railway building\r\nand in the promotion of enterprises that they even ignored old\r\npolitical standards. It would appear that when the subject of the\r\ntraining of the candidates was looked into it, it depended more on what\r\nuse such person would be for the work of getting a railway grant than\r\nhow he would vote on the tariff or on the rights of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written May 28, 1848, by W. H. Merritt to S. W.\r\nDurham, an old friend and fellow democrat, shows plainly the attitude\r\nof one of the leading men of the party, then living at Dubuque, but who\r\nhad formerly resided at Ivanhoe and hence was one of the early men in\r\nLinn county. He mentions Preston (Colonel Isaac Preston), and gives his\r\nreasons for not wanting him. The Leffingwell mentioned was the\r\nwell-known W. E. Leffingwell, who formerly resided at Muscatine, then\r\nBloomington, and later removed to Clinton county. He was an eloquent\r\nlawyer and a popular man. He was later defeated by William Smyth for\r\ncongress in this district. Bates and Folsom were both prominent Iowa\r\nCity men, and well known in political circles for many years. Judge\r\nGrant was the noted jurist of Davenport, and was a well-known railroad\r\npromoter who had much influence in early years in Iowa.\r\n\r\nIn this letter Mr. Merritt suggests George Greene as a candidate from\r\nLinn county. There is no doubt that if at this time Mr. Greene had been\r\nselected, he would have carried the district and made an enviable\r\nrecord as a statesman, and no doubt on account of his judgment and his\r\nkeenness in business, he would have obtained from congress such favors\r\nas would have amounted to much good for Iowa in the first stages of her\r\nstatehood. The letter does not show whether or not Mr. Greene had\r\nconsented or would consent to such a course, although it has been\r\nstated that he most likely would have consented to have made the\r\ncanvass. For congress the whigs nominated this year, 1848, D. F. Miller\r\nfor the first district and Tim Davis for the second district. The\r\ndemocrats nominated for the first district William Thompson, and for\r\nthe second district Shepherd Leffler. The whigs were strong, the total\r\nvote for president at the November elections being, Cass, democrat,\r\n12,093; Taylor, whig, 11,144; Van Buren, free soiler, 1,126.\r\n\r\nLeffler was elected, and Miller on a close vote contested the election\r\nof Thompson before congress. The committee on elections declared the\r\nseat vacant. Leffler, who was elected after an exciting canvass, was a\r\nnative of Pennsylvania, who came to Iowa Territory in 1835. He sat in\r\nthe first constitutional convention in 1844, and two years later was\r\nelected to congress by the state at large, and hence in 1848 he had the\r\ninside track. In 1856 he was again a candidate but was defeated by Tim\r\nDavis, his old whig opponent of 1848. In 1875 he was a candidate for\r\ngovernor against S. J. Kirkwood, and was defeated. He died at\r\nBurlington in 1879. He had been one of the trusted leaders of his party\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nThe letters from W. H. Merritt and George Greene show what interest\r\nthese men had in the railroad enterprise.\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MERRITT\r\n\r\n     \"Strictly confidential.\r\n                                      Dubuque, May 28, 1848.\r\n     \"Friend Durham:\r\n\r\n     \"Having retired from the editorial tripod I find more time\r\n     to devote to my friends in the reflective and agreeable\r\n     exercise of correspondence than formerly. Since my second\r\n     return to Iowa it would have been highly gratifying to my\r\n     feelings had I been so situated in business as to have\r\n     employed a portion of my time in personal communication with\r\n     my friends, in viewing scenes connected with the early\r\n     settlement of Iowa, and in witnessing the numerous monuments\r\n     reared to attest the prevailing, the restless and resistless\r\n     enterprise of the Anglo-American. In 1838, when I first\r\n     pitched my tent at Ivanhoe, Linn county had but few white\r\n     inhabitants, possessed but few attractions for one\r\n     accustomed to the society of one of the old Federal\r\n     colonies, and was entirely destitute of political or\r\n     judicial organization. Everything that the eye could behold\r\n     appeared in a rude state of nature. Vast prairies which\r\n     extended for miles presented no evidences of civilization,\r\n     no familiar sound like that of the woodman's axe appeared to\r\n     interrupt the solemn stillness of an uninhabited wilderness.\r\n     The marks of wild beasts and wild men were now and then\r\n     visible and the similitude was striking between the two, as\r\n     though both were born to the same sphere of action and\r\n     subject to the same laws of being. A sort of wildness and\r\n     sacred stillness seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere.\r\n     Reclining upon a buffalo robe in my tent, reflecting upon\r\n     the varied scenery without and quietly listening to the\r\n     solemn murmurs of the Cedar, I thought I could perceive\r\n     visions of earthly happiness for the man of true genius\r\n     nowhere else to be found. The longer I remained upon the\r\n     spot, the more it endeared itself to my affections, and the\r\n     less I thought of cultivated society and the dazzling\r\n     beauties of wealth, and its primeval companion, aristocracy.\r\n     Nature seemed to be decked in her nuptial dress and wild\r\n     beasts danced to and fro with a festive heart to the\r\n     harmonious notes of a troop of forest birds.\r\n\r\n     \"Circumstances forced me to leave that consecrated spot\r\n     after a year's residence, and once more become a victim to\r\n     the cold restraints and relentless laws of civilization. For\r\n     five years was I bound by stern necessity to a habitation\r\n     worse than a prison, and associated with men as little to be\r\n     admired for their social qualities of character as the\r\n     cannibals of old. To be engaged in merchandising among a\r\n     people whose only article of faith was 'cheat and grow\r\n     rich,' and whose friendship could be secured only by\r\n     corrupting the morals and lacerating the heart of the\r\n     innocent, was a pursuit little to be desired by one whose\r\n     heart had been consecrated to a different field of\r\n     enterprise and nourished by the sacred impulses of the West.\r\n     Be assured I escaped from this thralldom as soon as I could,\r\n     and never to this hour has my mind enjoyed that repose that\r\n     it did when seated upon the banks of the Cedar and\r\n     surrounded by the beautiful scenery of Ivanhoe. I\r\n     experienced a kind of maternal affection for the spot, a\r\n     mystic tie instinctively chains my mind to its early\r\n     history, and a magic like that which bound Blennerhasset to\r\n     his favorite island in the Ohio seems to pervade every\r\n     recollection connected with its name and its founder.\r\n\r\n     \"But I must abandon this subject, or I shall trespass upon\r\n     the time and space designed for another, and convert what\r\n     was intended for a political letter into a literary bore. As\r\n     you manifested a friendly solicitude when here that I should\r\n     take up my residence in Linn county when my studies were\r\n     finished, I thought it not out of place to remind you where\r\n     my inclination would lead me.\r\n\r\n     \"I would speak privately to you upon the subject of a\r\n     candidate for congress in this district. I understand that\r\n     Mr. Preston of Linn is to be a candidate; that Leffler will\r\n     be a candidate; Leffingwell of Bloomington and Bates and\r\n     Folsom of Iowa City. Leffler I do not believe can be\r\n     nominated. I think he has acted in bad faith with his\r\n     constituents. Leffingwell has no chance, although he has the\r\n     untiring vigilance of S. C. Hastings to support him. Preston\r\n     I fear has no chance. He is deceived by Hastings and I fear\r\n     erroneously counts upon the delegation from Dubuque. We have\r\n     appointed eight delegates. I am one. I have spoken to them\r\n     all and find that every man is in favor of giving the\r\n     nomination to Linn County for the reason that the interest\r\n     of Linn is identical with that of Dubuque in properly\r\n     agitating and ultimately constructing the Railroad from this\r\n     to Keokuk, but they will not support Preston because they\r\n     have no confidence in his ability.\r\n\r\n     \"One thing is very certain, Friend Durham, and that is that\r\n     we must elect a man who is identified with this great\r\n     railroad improvement. Preston would no doubt do all in his\r\n     power, but he fails to unite that confidence in his favor\r\n     necessary to give him the nomination. Leffler would no doubt\r\n     do what he has done, give Davenport the preference.\r\n     Leffingwell as a matter of course would feel but little\r\n     personal interest in a railroad running through the interior\r\n     of the state and forty or fifty miles removed from his\r\n     immediate constituency, to whom he is more nearly allied and\r\n     intimately associated in political friendship. All residing\r\n     upon the banks of the Mississippi and in its immediate\r\n     vicinity, except those at Keokuk and this point, are opposed\r\n     to any grant by Congress for this railroad, and I can hardly\r\n     conceive that it reflects any dishonor upon them as a\r\n     community or as private individuals, for they are no doubt\r\n     influenced like all men from natural and selfish impulses.\r\n     But with Mr. Leffler the case is far different. He was\r\n     elected to represent the wishes and interests of one entire\r\n     community of people, eight-tenths of whom have a direct and\r\n     vital interest in the success of this enterprise. He is\r\n     requested and repeatedly urged by petition and memorial to\r\n     give it his earnest support. But he pays no regard to their\r\n     solicitations until a scheme in which he is more directly\r\n     interested is matured, forwarded to him, and he puts it upon\r\n     its passage through Congress. At least six weeks before a\r\n     single step was taken in aid of the Davenport road in this\r\n     state, petitions were forwarded to Mr. Leffler for the\r\n     Dubuque and Keokuk road. In truth no move was made for the\r\n     Davenport road until Judge Grant returned from Washington\r\n     City, which was some twelve days after the Legislature had\r\n     convened, and after the petition had gone from this place,\r\n     Cascade, from your town, a memorial from the legislature,\r\n     and the convention had been held at Iowa City, at which, if\r\n     I mistake not, you were present. Under this state of facts I\r\n     cannot but regard Mr. Leffler as hostile to this road, in\r\n     which case our delegation cannot support his claim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME EARLY MEMBERS UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH, LISBON]\r\n\r\n     \"As to Bates and Folsom of Iowa City, we regard them as\r\n     feeling an equal interest in both roads, both proposing to\r\n     pass through Iowa City. Under these circumstances what\r\n     policy does it become us to adopt? Emphatically to select a\r\n     candidate upon the proposed line of road. Can you not bring\r\n     forward some man besides Preston? Mr. Boothe and some three\r\n     or four of our leading men have suggested to me that if Linn\r\n     county should bring forward G. G. [George Greene], he would\r\n     get the nomination and be elected by an overwhelming\r\n     majority. Mr. G. is absent and I know not whether it would\r\n     suit him if conferred. He is in feeling and interest\r\n     emphatically a Linn County man, but whether such a proposal\r\n     would strike him favorably or meet with his sanction are\r\n     questions which I am unable to solve. I think if sent to\r\n     Congress he would be a working man and would be very active\r\n     towards procuring an appropriation for the said road. He\r\n     feels, as does every Linn county man, a very deep interest\r\n     in the enterprise. I wish you would give this subject a\r\n     candid investigation and then write me upon the subject.\r\n\r\n     \"I have been solicited to become a candidate for the\r\n     Legislature. I have peremptorily declined. I feel no\r\n     particular aspirations for office. I desire to give my time\r\n     to the study of the law.

This testifies to Mr. Merritt's popularity among\r\nthe people of Iowa.\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM GEORGE GREENE\r\n\r\n                                 \"Dubuque, March 3, 1847.\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Durham:\r\n\r\n     \"I find that I cannot without great injury to my business\r\n     here, leave until next week; but still I am very anxious to\r\n     see the work go on.

[Greene]\r\n     send Andrew or some other person out to bring the field\r\n     notes in. I propose the finishing of Jo's first because it\r\n     can be done soonest. It will not require so long to plat the\r\n     work in the S. G.'s office, and it will not interfere with\r\n     the operations of Mr. Ross, who will take the field at the\r\n     time, or soon after, you do. He wrote Mr. Wiltse that he\r\n     should return to the work as soon as the snow decayed\r\n     sufficient to justify.

You will\r\n     take my horse, wagon, or anything else of mine that you may\r\n     need. Mr. Wiltse thinks you had better make all your\r\n     calculations before going upon the ground.

GREENE, Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe getting of a railroad into Cedar Rapids then was the much talked of\r\nscheme, and many people believed that this would also end in failure as\r\nmany other paper railroads had ended before. But the men at the head of\r\nthis company were men who had a standing in the financial world and\r\nwere in touch with the big banks of the country. They did not rely on\r\nthe taxes voted or on empty promises, for if these failed they would\r\nstill go on with the work. It is needless to add that this company,\r\nlike all others, got as much tax as possible and changed the location\r\nof the route according to the amounts of bonuses offered. When the road\r\nentered Cedar Rapids it was the beginning and the end in the long\r\nstruggle for railroad supremacy in the county, and decided for all\r\ntimes the supremacy of the river city over the county seat. The latter\r\nwithout a railway could do nothing more than sit down and wait till\r\nsuch a time as some company saw fit to extend a line across the state\r\nthrough other points.\r\n\r\nFor the air line known as the Iowa Central Air Line, the citizens of\r\nLinn county voted in June, 1853, the sum of $200,000 to aid in the\r\nconstruction of the road. In 1856 congress voted a grant of land to the\r\nstate of Iowa to aid in the construction of four roads across it,\r\nincluding one on the line of this company. The legislature in extra\r\nsession conferred the land on this road in case it was completed. A\r\ncontract was let to a New York concern to complete the road to Marion,\r\na distance of eighty miles. On account of the financial crash in 1857\r\nthe contractors failed to raise the money and to go on with the work.\r\nWhile the people were sore over this failure another company began\r\nbuilding from Clinton west and had completed forty miles during the\r\nyear 1858. It came as far as Lisbon by the end of this year, and this\r\nwas the first railroad station within the borders of Linn county.\r\n\r\nThe Dubuque and Southwestern was extended through to Cedar Rapids in\r\n1865, just six years after the Northwestern road had laid its track to\r\nthe river and had trains running. This caused Cedar Rapids to become at\r\nthat early day a sort of railway center, and opened up a new territory\r\ntowards Dubuque. It was not a success financially till it was absorbed\r\nby the Milwaukee road in May, 1878.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from one of the first employes will be of interest\r\nin this connection:\r\n\r\n                                 \"Lamar, Mo., Sept. 5, 1910.\r\n\r\n     \"The Dubuque and Southwestern track was laid to Springville\r\n     in the year 1859 or 1860. Mr. Jessup was president, and J.\r\n     P. Farley, superintendent and manager. Mr. McConnell was\r\n     road master. He owned a farm near Langworthy. I remember the\r\n     first regular train was composed of one mail, express and\r\n     baggage car combined, and one flat-top coach. The engine\r\n     pulling the string was named 'Prairie King,' a little 14 by\r\n     16 or 18 inch cylinder. The track was laid with about 50\r\n     pound English T rail. The road had at this time three\r\n     engines besides the 'Prairie King,' viz: the 'Prairie\r\n     Queen,' still smaller than the King, the 'Anamosa,' and the\r\n     'Monticello,' which was of the Rogers make of engines, the\r\n     other three being of Mason manufacture. The conductor,\r\n     Archie Cox, engineer, Ace Owens, and Baggagemaster Watson\r\n     came to our house for supper and boarded with our folks\r\n     until they could get accommodations at the Bruce house, and\r\n     I went the next day on the train as the first newsboy. I\r\n     was still newsboy when Vicksburg was taken. I then went to\r\n     the army and stayed until after the war closed. I went on\r\n     the road again after the war as fireman, brakeman, and\r\n     baggageman. About 1870 I was promoted to conductor and\r\n     stayed with the company until 1875. After Archie Cox quit\r\n     the road Frank Farley took his place, and when the road was\r\n     extended to Cedar Rapids, two or three years later, they put\r\n     another train on, one leaving Cedar Rapids in the morning\r\n     and one leaving Farley Junction in the morning. After they\r\n     put on the second train Charley Farley was conductor of that\r\n     train and George Farley was agent at the station at Cedar\r\n     Rapids. Pat Cunningham was roadmaster for several years, and\r\n     James Rollo was master mechanic and engineer for ten or\r\n     twelve years. Our first stock cars were flat cars and when\r\n     we got an order for a stock car we would take a flat car to\r\n     the shop and put stakes and slats on in order to hold the\r\n     stock while in transit.\r\n\r\n                                         C. H. BRANCH.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most important occurrences in the county was when on June\r\n15, 1859, the first railroad made its entrance into Cedar Rapids and\r\nonce and for all made the town the chief city in this part of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThis was accomplished after many failures and after much money had been\r\nexpended for surveys and in other ways. The following from men still\r\nliving, who remember the affair, will give the reader an idea as to how\r\njubilant all were on the day of this celebration:\r\n\r\nGeorge C. Haman was at that time running a drug store at about the same\r\nlocation he has now. The corner of First avenue and First street was\r\nthen occupied by what was called Greene's hotel, and Mr. Haman occupied\r\na store room in the south side of the building. He remembers distinctly\r\nthe big celebration held in honor of the first train to arrive.\r\n\r\nMr. Haman said, as near as he could remember, that the town of Cedar\r\nRapids had a population of about 1,500 people at that time and a big\r\ncelebration was inaugurated and carried out. People from the\r\nsurrounding country came to town to see the train come in, and the\r\nIndians on the reservation at Tama almost turned out enmasse to see the\r\ngreat piece of machinery that they had heard so much about but had\r\nnever seen. The day was a great holiday, much of the regular business\r\nbeing suspended and the people turned out in their best clothes to\r\ncelebrate what was to them the greatest day in the history of the city.\r\n\r\nThe train pulled into the city to the tune of hundreds of voices, that\r\ncontained but little harmony but plenty of volume. Arms, hats and\r\nhandkerchiefs were waved in accompaniment, displaying a due\r\nappreciation for the beginning of what was to make Cedar Rapids the\r\nbeautiful and prosperous city that it is. A railroad was what was\r\nneeded and it was now theirs.\r\n\r\nThe terminal of the road was about where the packing house is now\r\nlocated, and it was a couple of years before an extension was made, the\r\ntrack being laid as far as the location of the cereal mills, which at\r\nthat time was an enterprise yet to come.\r\n\r\nMr. Haman says that one incident is fixed indelibly on his memory, and\r\nthat was the big dance that was held that night. He was obliged to\r\nremain at the store during the day and did not get to see the train\r\ncome in, but he attended the dance which continued until sunrise the\r\nnext morning. He was a single man and as was the custom had his lady\r\nfriend with him and was obliged to send her home in an omnibus, the\r\nthen prevailing means of transportation about the city, as it was time\r\nto open the store and he did not have time to accompany her home. The\r\ndance was held in what was known as Daniels hall, located where the\r\nMasonic Temple now stands.\r\n\r\nAnother who has recollections of the great event is Emery Brown and it\r\nwas in conversation between Mr. Haman and Emery Brown that these facts\r\nwere collected. The road was extended to Cedar Rapids from Clinton,\r\nwhere connection was made to Chicago. There was no bridge across the\r\nMississippi river at that time and the trains were ferried across the\r\nriver by means of a large, flat ferry boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRESENT DAY SCENE IN LINN COUNTY COPYRIGHT BY BAYLIS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD LAND RECEIPT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEAMBOAT ON THE CEDAR, 1887]\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the railroad the town was obliged to give $100,000\r\nto the railroad company. Stock was issued in payment. James L. Bever\r\nwas another man in business here at that time and he made it a point to\r\npurchase all this city stock he could, which proved to be to his\r\nadvantage. The road was later leased by the Northwestern and finally\r\npurchased.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this road a Linn county biography offers the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     \"The organization under which this line came into Cedar\r\n     Rapids was the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad company,\r\n     which was organized at Clinton in January, 1856. There were\r\n     several railroad prospects about this time formulating in\r\n     Clinton, or in places having a close proximity to the\r\n     Mississippi. Finally all the railroad enterprises extending\r\n     westward from the river united in the Chicago, Iowa and\r\n     Nebraska railroad. When that company commenced their\r\n     operations, it was expected it would have the co-operation\r\n     of the Galena company. Failing to receive this it pressed\r\n     forward its work unaided, and by the latter part of 1857 had\r\n     the track laid as far as the Wapsipinicon river, a distance\r\n     of thirty-six miles. In July, 1858, it was laid as far as\r\n     Clarence, Cedar county, and in December, the same year, the\r\n     road was completed to Lisbon, sixty-four miles from Clinton.\r\n     The following June (1859) the locomotive steamed into Cedar\r\n     Rapids, a distance of eighty-two miles from the Mississippi.\r\n     There was great rejoicing here and the event was duly\r\n     celebrated.\r\n\r\n     \"It was a most important event to Cedar Rapids for it was\r\n     the termination of a struggle for railroad supremacy in the\r\n     county.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1862 the road was leased to the Chicago and Northwestern\r\n     company, and before the lease expired it had secured control\r\n     of it. Work was resumed on the extension (for which the\r\n     Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad company was organized),\r\n     and pushed with vigor. It was completed across the great\r\n     state of Iowa to Council Bluffs in 1867, where it made\r\n     connections with the Union Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_The Old Settlers' Association_\r\n\r\n\r\nA vigorous Old Settlers' Association has been maintained for several\r\nyears, the meeting being held at Marion.

Durham as proper persons with whom to\r\nconsult on matters bearing upon the political issues of the day. It\r\nalso shows how they fought for postoffices then as they do now, and how\r\ncareful and shrewd these old fellows were in getting in touch with\r\ntheir constituents. According to a letter from the assistant\r\npostmaster-general, Dr. Brice is not deserving of the office, and\r\nGeorge Melton is recommended. This was referred to S. W. Durham, as\r\nwell as the change of the name of the postoffice from Lindon to\r\nSpringville. It was signed by fifty-eight citizens of Springville. A.\r\nC. Dodge was born in 1812, the son of Henry Dodge. He was in congress\r\nuntil the territory became a state, and with G. W. Jones became one of\r\nthe first two senators from Iowa. Mr. Dodge remained in congress till\r\n1855 when the democratic party lost control of the state and a union of\r\nall the other parties elected James Harlan to succeed him. Senator\r\nDodge was later minister to Spain. He died in 1883, having won the\r\nrespect and confidence of all political parties. The letters show how\r\ncarefully the friends of Dodge kept him in touch with political\r\nconditions in every township in his district.\r\n\r\nThe assembly met at Iowa City on December 4, 1848. G. W. Jones was a\r\ncandidate against Judge T. S. Wilson, who lost by a majority of one.\r\nDodge had no opposition in his own party and received the unanimous\r\nnomination. The democratic party in this session had a majority on\r\njoint ballot. He no doubt had been busy, and had his friends keep him\r\nposted on the course of events. This list no doubt was furnished him\r\nfor the purpose of keeping in touch with the electors and to give him\r\nan opportunity to select postmasters in accordance with services\r\nrendered. The letters give some the name whig, which would go to show\r\nthat all the remainder could be relied upon as democratic in their\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nThe list has names of a number of men who later became noted lawyers,\r\ndoctors, and shrewd business men.\r\n\r\nThe Marion postoffice was not always a plum to fight over, as it has\r\nbeen of late. It was first established in 1839 at the home of L. M.\r\nStrong, a farmer and tavern-keeper within the present confines of the\r\ncounty seat. L. Daniels came in 1840 to start the first store, and he\r\nin turn became the postmaster for a time till he gave it up to John\r\nZunro, who with Mr. Hoops started a grocery store and wanted the\r\npostoffice so as to have people coming in now and then.\r\n\r\n               Marion, Linn County, Iowa, December 30, 1848.\r\n\r\n     HON.

Brice, the Postmaster at Center Point, County of Linn,\r\n     State of Iowa, is said not to have deserved the appointment.\r\n     The late P. M. recommends George Melton.\r\n\r\n     Before submitting this case to the Postmaster General, I\r\n     have to request the favor of any information you may\r\n     possess, or be able conveniently to obtain, respecting it.\r\n\r\n                  I have the honor to be,\r\n                       Very respectfully, &c.\r\n\r\n                                          HORATIO KING,\r\n\r\n                              First Assistant Postmaster General.\r\n\r\n     HON. A. C. DODGE,\r\n         U. S. Senator.\r\n\r\n     Endorsed:\r\n         (Private)\r\n\r\n     Dear Friend:\r\n\r\n     Please enquire into the matter herein referred to & let me\r\n     know the result & greatly oblige,\r\n\r\n                       Truly your friend,\r\n                                           A. C. DODGE.\r\n\r\n     S. W. Durham, Esq.\r\n\r\nDr. S. M. Brice was located in Center Point about 1840-41, going there\r\nfrom Cedar Rapids. He remained but a short time. Dr. Brice was a whig\r\nin politics, and Center Point had always been strongly democratic. He\r\nwas the first postmaster of the village.\r\n\r\nThe objections set out in the letter must have been political for he\r\nwas considered a wide-awake and estimable man in every particular.\r\n\r\nPost Office Department,\r\nAppointment Office, July 22, 1854.\r\n\r\n     Sir:\r\n\r\n     A. P. Risley, the Postmaster at Springville, County of Linn,\r\n     State of Iowa, with 58 citizens, recommends the change of\r\n     site and name of the office to Lindon.\r\n\r\n     Before submitting this case to the Postmaster General, I\r\n     have to request the favor of any information you may\r\n     possess, or be able conveniently to obtain, respecting it.\r\n\r\n                  I have the honor to be,\r\n                       Very respectfully, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                          HORATIO KING,\r\n                              First Assistant Postmaster General.\r\n\r\n     HON. A. C. DODGE,\r\n         U. S. Senator.\r\n             Endorsed, The same of this, etc.,\r\n                 greatly\r\n                     oblige\r\n                         Yours truly,\r\n                             A. C. DODGE.\r\n\r\n             S. W. Durham, Esq.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the first postoffice was established in the township known as\r\nBrown by Isaac Butler. It was the third postoffice in the county and\r\nwas known as Springville. Mail was received on horseback weekly. A. P.\r\nRisley opened a store in 1845 and became postmaster. He is the person\r\nreferred to in the letter of Senator Dodge. Mr. Risley sold out and\r\nremoved a mile east of the town, and with A. E. Sampson laid out a new\r\ntown called Lindon. A postoffice was secured though not without a\r\nfight, and the town of New Lindon assumed the airs of city life. A\r\nhotel and blacksmith shop also kept the town alive for the time, but it\r\ndied like other towns when the railroad was secured by Springville, and\r\nthe booming town of Lindon has been for many years a good corn field\r\nand a rich pasture. Sterling became postmaster at Springville after\r\nRisley. He was succeeded by John Hoffman.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEDAR RAPIDS POSTOFFICE\r\n\r\nWhile Joseph Greene was postmaster he also acted as the first\r\nstorekeeper of the town, and it is related of him that he carried his\r\nmail in his hat. The following, written by J. L. Enos, in the _Cedar\r\nValley Times_, may give the reader an idea of the postoffice situation\r\nup to the close of the Civil war. He writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The postoffice was established in 1847 and Joseph Greene\r\n     appointed postmaster. Mr. Greene was removed on a change of\r\n     administration, and L. Daniels appointed to succeed him.\r\n     Homer Bishop was the third incumbent and held the office\r\n     through a succession of years, giving very general\r\n     satisfaction. At the commencement of Lincoln's\r\n     administration Mr. Bishop was removed, and in accordance\r\n     with a mistaken and dangerous policy which promotes men of a\r\n     particular class or profession in places of trust, without\r\n     regard to their moral or any other qualifications--J. G.\r\n     Davenport, until then the editor of the _Cedar Valley\r\n     Times_, was appointed.\r\n\r\n     \"Those acquainted with Davenport did not suppose he would be\r\n     able to present satisfactory bonds but after some little\r\n     delay he succeeded in procuring them and in due course of\r\n     time took possession of the office. (Though a republican in\r\n     politics, Mr. Davenport had to appeal to democratic friends\r\n     for these bonds. J. J. Snouffer was one of them and shared\r\n     in the subsequent loss.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROF. H. H. FREER Mt. Vernon]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. GEO. B. BOWMAN, D. D. Founder of Cornell College]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH MEKOTA Cedar Rapids]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. F. SEVERA Cedar Rapids]\r\n\r\n     \"A large number of clerks (?) was found necessary and it\r\n     became evident that the office was managed with great\r\n     recklessness. Money was lost through the mail when sent to\r\n     the nearest postoffice on the route, and money sent to\r\n     persons in the city from adjacent offices never came to\r\n     hand. Postage stamps were borrowed from neighboring offices\r\n     and return payment obtained with great difficulty, and in\r\n     some cases there was a refusal to pay--because as he\r\n     (Davenport) said, he had already paid the amount borrowed.\r\n     He was at last removed, and on settling up the affairs of\r\n     the office, there was found to be a shortage to the amount\r\n     of fifteen hundred dollars. His bondsmen went to work and\r\n     finally succeeded in effecting a credit on a part of the\r\n     amount and had the satisfaction of paying about one thousand\r\n     dollars, which had been stolen from the government by this\r\n     arch swindler. After minor swindling operations he\r\n     absconded, thus relieving the city of the most bare-faced\r\n     falsifier and swindler that has infested the city since the\r\n     time of Shepard & Co., in the early day.\r\n\r\n     \"George M. Howlett, the present incumbent, was appointed his\r\n     successor and makes an efficient officer. In the spring of\r\n     1865 Cedar Rapids was designated as a money order office,\r\n     commencing operations as such on the 3d of July following.\r\n     This enlarges the responsibility of the office and great\r\n     care is necessary to keep all things right--though the\r\n     blanks furnished make the work simple in honest hands.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nL. Daniels was another of the early postmasters. He, also, was a\r\nmerchant, and so was Homer Bishop, his successor in office. It was not\r\nuntil J. G. Davenport became postmaster that the postoffice got into\r\npolitics. In fact it was no plum worth having till about the time of\r\nthe Civil war. A number of prominent men have since that time held the\r\npostoffice--such as Captain W. W. Smith, Charles Weare, Alex. Charles,\r\nGeo. A. Lincoln, W. R. Boyd, and W. G. Haskell, the present incumbent.\r\n\r\nA. C. Taylor relates how, when he came to Cedar Rapids, he carried on\r\nhis jewelry store in the postoffice building, his store being located\r\non the alley, in the rear of where the Masonic Temple now stands. The\r\npostoffice at Cedar Rapids soon outgrew the first government building,\r\nerected in the '90s, and the second was completed in 1909 at a cost of\r\n$250,000.\r\n\r\nIf a person asked for his mail in the olden days more than once a month\r\nhe was considered too important, and the postmaster would gently remind\r\nhim that he had no legal right to bother a man more than once a month,\r\nat least, about such a small matter as a letter. The postoffice during\r\nthe past sixty-three years has grown to enormous proportions, till it\r\nnow takes the entire time of a score of people to expedite the handling\r\nof the mails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_The Physicians of the County_\r\n\r\nBY FREDERICK G. MURRAY\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the first doctors who located in and around Marion should be\r\nmentioned S. H. Tryon, F. W. Tailor, and James Cummings. These men came\r\nbefore 1840. They were followed by T. S. Bardwell and L. W. Phelps. Dr.\r\nTryon at least came as early as 1838 and was for many years a\r\nwell-known public character. He acted as county clerk and held many\r\nposts of honor.\r\n\r\nDr. J. K. Rickey bought John Young's claim in Cedar Rapids as early as\r\n1841 and must have been located in that vicinity at that time. What\r\nbecame of him is not known, and whether or not he engaged in the\r\npractice extensively is doubtful. There were not many whites there in\r\nthose early days and it is a question if any had the time or\r\ninclination to be very sick. In case they were it was no doubt\r\nhomesickness, for which a doctor has so far been unable to offer any\r\npermanent cure.\r\n\r\nThe first doctor who came to Cedar Rapids was inclined to blow his own\r\nhorn. J. L. Enos, the editor of the _Cedar Valley Times_, has the\r\nfollowing to say: \"Once when he had returned from Muscatine he claimed\r\nto have lost forty pounds of quinine in one of the streams below the\r\nCedar. Constable Lewis once called on him with an execution to secure a\r\njudgment. The doctor threw off his coat and prepared for a fight. The\r\nconstable seeing his opportunity seized the coat and made away with it\r\nand found therein sufficient money to satisfy the debt.\"\r\n\r\nProfiting by the example, later comers have avoided fights and have\r\ntried to pay their debts.\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence between S. W. Durham and A. C. Dodge in December,\r\n1848, the following named doctors are referred to: S. M. Brice (whig),\r\nCenter Point; Ivanhoe, Jno. Evans; Hollenback P. O., Dr. Williams;\r\nCedar Rapids P. O., J. F. Ely.\r\n\r\nThus during 1848 the above named persons must have been residents and\r\npracticing physicians in their respective localities. Dr. Brice was the\r\nsecond doctor in Cedar Rapids. Later he moved to Center Point. These\r\nmen were no doubt slated as candidates for postmasters. Dr. Brice later\r\nacted as postmaster at Center Point.\r\n\r\nA history of the medical profession in Linn county must be largely made\r\nup of a list of names, as the intrinsic work of the medical\r\npractitioner is scarcely a fit subject matter for the casual reader.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be the earliest date in connection with which there is\r\nmention of a physician in the county annals is 1841, in which year Dr.\r\nMagnus Holmes came to the town of Marion from Crawfordsville, Indiana.\r\nPromising to be of great value to the community, Dr. Holmes passed away\r\na short time after his arrival. Dr. Henry M. Ristine, father of Dr. J.\r\nM. Ristine, of Cedar Rapids, was a brother-in-law of Dr. Holmes, and\r\ncame to Marion from Indiana in 1842. Another of the very earliest\r\npractitioners was Dr. Sam Grafton, who was located on the Cedar river\r\nat Ivanhoe bridge, on the old military road from Dubuque to Iowa City.\r\nJust when he came is not known; this was one of the earliest\r\nsettlements in the county and he had practiced there for some four\r\nyears previous to 1847, in which year he fell a victim to a typhoid\r\nepidemic. Dr. Amos Witter was one of the first physicians in Mt.\r\nVernon. He passed away in 1862 at the age of fifty-five, having been\r\nseveral years a member of the legislature. In 1886 there was still\r\nliving in Viola a Dr. S. S. Matson, who had practiced there since 1845.\r\nHe graduated from the University of Vermont in 1832, the same year in\r\nwhich Dr. Elisha W. Lake, an early Marion physician, graduated from the\r\nOhio Medical College. These two men are in point of graduation the\r\noldest men the county has had. In northeastern Linn the first physician\r\nwas Dr. Stacy, who lived on the Anamosa and Quasqueton road near\r\nBoulder church. He was a brother to the late Judge Stacy, the pioneer\r\npromoter of the Dubuque & Southwestern Railroad. Some of the other\r\nearly practitioners were Dr. E. L. Mansfield, who came to Cedar Rapids\r\nor Kingston in 1847; Dr. J. M. Traer, who made Cedar Rapids his home\r\nfrom 1847-51; Dr. J. F. Ely, who came to the same place in 1848; and\r\nDr. S. D. Carpenter, who came in 1849.\r\n\r\nDr. Shattuck, of Green's Mills, now Coggon, Drs. Lannin and Byam, of\r\nParis, Drs. Patterson and Mitchell, of Clark's Ford, now Central City,\r\nand Dr. Young, of Prairieburg, were all pioneer doctors in their\r\nrespective communities. Dr. T. S. Bardwell, who became a leading\r\nphysician of Marion, settled on a farm in that vicinity in 1840, making\r\nhis residence in the county date back farther than that of any other\r\nmedical man except S. H. Tryon.\r\n\r\nA rather incomplete business directory of Cedar Rapids in 1856 gives\r\nthe following as physicians: S. C. Koontz, J. H. Camburn, W. D.\r\nBarclay, J. W. Edes, Smith & Larrabee, R. R. Taylor.\r\n\r\nA complete city directory published in 1869 gives the names of the\r\nfollowing: C. F. Bullen, J. H. Camburn, G. P. Carpenter, J. P. Coulter,\r\nJ. W. Edes, Mansfield & Smith, Freeman McClelland, John North, Israel\r\nSnyder, C. H. Thompson, W. Bollinger, J. C. May. Of these, Dr. Camburn\r\nand Dr. Edes were prominent in their profession for many years. Dr. R.\r\nR. Taylor was a Virginian, who went to reside in Philadelphia about the\r\ntime of the Civil war. Dr. J. C. May was a druggist as well as a very\r\npopular physician. He was a brother of the late Major May, of island\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nA medical and surgical directory of Iowa for 1876 gives the first\r\nauthentic list of doctors in Linn county to which access has been had.\r\nA list of fifty is given as in active practice in the county at that\r\ntime. Only six of these remain: Dr. George P. Carpenter, dean of the\r\nprofession in Cedar Rapids; Dr. G. R. Skinner, of Cedar Rapids; Dr. T.\r\nS. Kepler, of Mt. Vernon; Dr. Hindman, of Marion; Dr. Edwin Burd, of\r\nLisbon; and Dr. F. M. Yost, of Center Point. The last of these, Dr.\r\nYost, class of 1853 University of Pennsylvania, is the oldest living\r\npractitioner in the county. His two sons are now associated with him in\r\nhis work. One other, Dr. J. H. Smith, of Cedar Rapids, has not been in\r\npractice for many years but preserves a close relation to his old\r\ncalling through his presidency of the board of directors of St. Luke's\r\nHospital. The two Doctors Sigworth are still living near their old\r\nneighborhood, having retired to Anamosa.\r\n\r\nA registry of all physicians practicing in the county was begun in the\r\ncounty clerk's office in 1880-1881. It started with sixty-four names,\r\nprobably the full number of those in active practice at the time. Since\r\nthen about 230 additional doctors have been registered, and of this\r\ntotal of nearly 300 about 125 are now practicing in the county.\r\n\r\nAt Western some of the early physicians were Dr. Crouse, Dr. W. B.\r\nWagner, Dr. Miller, all of whom preceded Dr. J. C. Schrader who removed\r\nto Iowa City. Dr. J. C. Hanshay located here in 1863 and Dr. Favour in\r\n1877. Dr. Patterson was the first doctor in Bertram, in 1857. Dr. J.\r\nStricklippe was an early doctor and druggist at Palo, and Dr. J. W.\r\nFirkin was the second doctor at Vanderbilt, later known as Fairfax. His\r\nson, Edgar Firkin, is now a popular druggist there. Dr. U. C. Roe came\r\nto Fairfax in 1864 for the practice of medicine. He also sold drugs.\r\nThe business finally drifted into a grocery store, as it seems that the\r\nsettlers preferred sugar and prunes to pills and quinine.\r\n\r\nAmong names of note in the early history of these parts are those of\r\nseveral medical doctors whose prominence came along lines outside of\r\ntheir professional work. Dr. John P. Ely's name is prominently\r\nconnected with the early business enterprises and later growth of Cedar\r\nRapids. The doctor was called in the year he finished his medical\r\nstudies in New York to the management of commercial and manufacturing\r\ninterests in this county. The growth of these drew him gradually from\r\nthe excellent practice for which he at first found time. To the close\r\nof his life, however, Dr. Ely kept himself well informed on the\r\nprogress of scientific medicine. Perhaps the first autopsy in this\r\nlocality was performed by Dr. Ely in the interests of both science and\r\nsobriety, if early annals are authentic, the subject having been in\r\nlife notorious for his potations.\r\n\r\nDr. Eber L. Mansfield along with a large medical practice found time to\r\nbuild up successful business and real estate interests on both sides of\r\nthe river at Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nDr. Seymour D. Carpenter left the practice after the Civil war and\r\nbecame active and highly successful in the building and financing of\r\nrailroads in this state and further south. Dr. Carpenter is still\r\nliving in a hale old age in Chicago.\r\n\r\nDr. Freeman McClelland, a talented graduate of Jefferson Medical\r\nCollege, won for himself enviable popularity and influence through his\r\neditorship of the Cedar Rapids _Times_. The flavor of his writings and\r\nrare personality are an enduring remembrance with all who knew him.\r\n\r\nDr. J. T. Headley, the eminent platform lecturer, at present living\r\nretired in Philadelphia, is said to have first hung out his \"shingle\"\r\nin Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nDr. G. W. Holmes, son of Dr. Magnus Holmes, of Marion, after finishing\r\nat Bellevue, went as a medical missionary of the American Board to\r\nPersia, where in addition to his other work he became royal physician\r\nto the Crown Prince, afterwards Shah of Persia. Dr. Holmes passed away\r\nin June, 1910.\r\n\r\nLinn county sent a number of doctors to the army during the Civil war.\r\nThe following list is as nearly accurate as to men and organizations as\r\nit was possible to make it:\r\n\r\nDr. H. M. Ristine, surgeon 20th Iowa Infantry.\r\n\r\nDr. J. F. Ely, surgeon 24th Iowa.\r\n\r\nDr. J. H. Camburn, surgeon 16th Iowa Infantry, also 6th Iowa Cavalry.\r\n\r\nDr. Freeman McClelland, surgeon 16th Iowa Infantry.\r\n\r\nDr. H. M. Lyons, surgeon 16th Iowa Infantry.\r\n\r\nDr. John F. Smith, assistant surgeon 65th Illinois Infantry.\r\n\r\nDr. G. L. Carhardt, surgeon 31st Iowa.\r\n\r\nDr. J. C. Shrader went from near Western College, this county, with the\r\n22d Iowa Infantry as captain and later as surgeon.\r\n\r\nDr. Amos Witter, surgeon 7th Iowa Infantry.\r\n\r\nDr. T. S. Bardwell served as first assistant surgeon with the 6th Iowa\r\nCavalry, Col. Carskadden of Marion, notably in an expedition against\r\nthe Indians who were threatening the Nebraska and Dakota frontier, the\r\nmale portion of the settlers there being largely absent in the Union\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nDr. Seth Byam, of Jackson township, was surgeon in the U. S. army.\r\n\r\nDr. Seymour D. Carpenter, surgeon U. S. A., during the four years of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nOf those who served otherwise than as surgeons, Dr. J. P. Coulter was\r\nlieutenant colonel of the 12th Iowa Infantry. He afterwards was active\r\nin city and county politics and held several official positions, and\r\ndistantly related to him was the late Dr. A. B. Coulter, in whose\r\nuntimely passing away the community lost one of its most promising\r\nprofessional men.\r\n\r\nDr. G. R. Skinner, who came to Cedar Rapids in 1871, spent four years\r\nin the Civil war, leaving the service with a captain's commission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LATE DR. J. S. LOVE, SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\nDr. W. H. French served through the war in the 89th Illinois Infantry.\r\n\r\nOf those men whose distinctly professional work brought them especial\r\nesteem, space will allow for the mention of only a few.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for no other one of their brethren did the Linn county\r\nprofession award so universal preference as to Dr. Henry Ristine.\r\nPioneer, patriot, and public-spirited citizen, he was first and before\r\nall a doctor, combining in generous measure the traits and faculties\r\nthat make an eminently successful surgeon, with culture and genial\r\nsympathies. It could be truly said of him that he adorned his\r\nprofession. His portrait hangs in St. Luke's Hospital along with that\r\nof the late Judge Greene, whom he ably seconded in the work of founding\r\nthat institution. Jurist and surgeon alike believed in the hospital as\r\nthe workshop without which the doctor could not do his best work, and\r\ntheir efforts accomplished much toward the establishment of medical and\r\nsurgical justice to the physically afflicted, a form of service that\r\ndeserves more and more public recognition in every community where\r\nmoral justice to the criminally accused is so amply facilitated by the\r\ncourts of law.\r\n\r\nAmong other well remembered physicians were Dr. J. S. Love, of\r\nSpringville, Dr. James Carson, of Mt. Vernon, Dr. D. McClenahan, of\r\nCedar Rapids, and Dr. G. L. Carhardt, of Marion. Beginning at an early\r\ndate and devoting themselves exclusively to their practice till\r\nadvancing age forced retirement, they all four typically exemplified in\r\ntheir respective communities the life of the family physician. They\r\nwere, none of them, modern doctors, but they lived not only to see but\r\nto rejoice in the day of modern medicine. Long after they had ceased\r\nfrom practice they kept up attendance at medical society meetings,\r\nkeenly alive to the advancements of medical art and scientific research\r\nthere discussed. They were resourceful men, and they had labored\r\nfaithfully and well with the art available in their day, how often\r\nfutilely none felt more keenly than themselves. The realization that\r\nmodern methods promised control of much that had baffled them seemed to\r\nlighten the burden of their declining years. Their abiding interest and\r\nfaith in the future things of medicine was an inspiration to their\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nOf medical organizations in Linn county the oldest is the Union Medical\r\nSociety, founded as the Linn County Medical Society at Mt. Vernon in\r\n1859 by Drs. Love, Ely, Ristine, Carson, and Lyon. Dormant during the\r\nwar, it resumed in 1866 and ran till 1873, when its name was changed to\r\nthe Iowa Union and it became a district society, taking its membership\r\nfrom half a dozen or more counties and centering in Linn and Johnson\r\ncounties. It still meets twice a year at Cedar Rapids, occasionally at\r\nIowa City for scientific work. Its officers now are: president, C. W.\r\nBaker, Stanwood; secretary, F. G. Murray, Cedar Rapids; treasurer, C.\r\nP. Carpenter, Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe present Linn County Society was organized in Cedar Rapids in 1903.\r\nIt holds meetings twice a year and is the unit of the State and\r\nAmerican Medical Associations. One of its members, Dr. G. E. Crawford,\r\nis the outgoing president of the Iowa State Medical Society. Its\r\npresent officers are: president, Dr. A. B. Poore; secretary, Dr. H. W.\r\nBender; treasurer, Frank S. Skinner.\r\n\r\nThere are other local organizations at Mt. Vernon and Cedar Rapids. The\r\nPractitioners' Club of the latter place meets once a month for\r\ndiscussion and action upon medical subjects of special interest to the\r\nmembers. Its officers are: Dr. H. S. Raymer, president; H. E. Pfeiffer,\r\nsecretary; G. P. Carpenter, treasurer.\r\n\r\nSt. Luke's Hospital at Cedar Rapids has already been mentioned. It was\r\nfounded in 1883. On its consulting staff are Drs. G. P. Carpenter, J.\r\nM. Ristine, G. R. Skinner, G. E. Crawford, A. B. Poore, and A. H.\r\nJohnson. It has an attending staff of younger men. The hospital has\r\nseventy-five beds, having recently added a new and completely appointed\r\nmaternity department. Mercy Hospital, ninety beds, founded at Cedar\r\nRapids in 1902 and housed in its spacious new building in 1904, is\r\nunder the care of the Sisters of Mercy. These finely equipped\r\ninstitutions serve Cedar Rapids, Marion, the railroad systems and their\r\ncontributing territory with facilities for the best of medical,\r\nsurgical and maternity work. Few realize the large amount of free\r\nhumanitarian work they accomplish every year. Together with Linn\r\ncounty's own excellent infirmary north of Marion they represent in a\r\nmaterial and public way the present status of medical art, science, and\r\nhumanitarianism in the county. Personally and privately these are\r\nrepresented by the 125 active practitioners of medicine.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the names of only a few of these have been\r\nmentioned and then only incidentally. The scope of this sketch does not\r\nallow adequate individual reference to the remainder. Nor is this the\r\nplace to record contemporary progress. The lives of all the present\r\nmembers of the profession belong not to the past but to the future\r\nhistory of medicine in Linn county.

Old\r\nresidents who have returned after a period of twenty-five to thirty\r\nyears mention this fact, and what is true of the cities and towns is\r\nperhaps much more true of the rural districts in general.\r\n\r\nWilliam Abbe erected a bark cabin for the use of his family the first\r\nsummer, after he came here, and built a log house that fall for his\r\nwinter abode. Ed Crow, C. C. Haskins, and others also erected very\r\nfrail cabins during the first year they lived within the confines of\r\nthe county. John Henry, it is said, built a small store-building facing\r\nthe river in the squatter town of Westport in 1838. It was a frame\r\nbuilding about 14 x 18, scarcely high enough for any of the Oxley\r\nBrothers (who were very tall men) to enter. He also erected a small\r\ndwelling house near the store-building, which, if anything, was smaller\r\nthan the store-building. All the lumber in these buildings, except the\r\nwindow frames and the sills, were cut in the timber adjoining the\r\nriver; even the roof was cut out of rough boards, with a broad saw. The\r\nnails used were brought from Muscatine, as well as a few hinges, and\r\nthe windows. These buildings were torn down in 1860. The Shepherd\r\nTavern was also a rude log building, as was the John Young house, which\r\nwas afterwards used as a hotel, with additions added later.\r\n\r\nG. R. Carroll, in his _Pioneer Life_, mentions the first cabin erected\r\nby his father, Isaac Carroll, in 1839. It took about ten days to erect\r\nan ordinary cabin. \"It stood on the east side of the road near Mr.\r\nBower's nursery on the boulevard one and a half miles from the river.\r\nIt was a very primitive looking structure, 16 x 18 perhaps, with what\r\nwe called a cob roof, made of clapboards with logs on top to hold them\r\nin place. It was quite an agreeable change from our tent and wagons\r\nwhen we entered this new cabin, although there was not a great deal of\r\nroom to spare after our goods were unloaded and the nine members of the\r\nfamily were gathered within its walls. When the table was spread there\r\nwas no passing from one side to the other, except as we got upon our\r\nhands and knees and crawled under.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll also speaks of the second house, which was erected the same\r\nfall on the same premises. \"It was, however, not to be a common kind of\r\na cabin, it was to be a somewhat ambitious structure for the time, in\r\nfact it was to be the best house in Linn county, and when completed, it\r\nenjoyed that distinction. It was said, that there was nothing in the\r\ncounty that equalled it. The dimensions of this house were 14 x 16, a\r\nstory and a half high. There were in the walls of this house between\r\nfifty and sixty white oak logs, most of them quite straight and free\r\nfrom knots. The ends of the logs were cut off square and the corners\r\nwere laid up like square blocks, care being taken to cut off enough at\r\nthe ends to allow the logs to come as close together as possible so as\r\nto leave but little space for chinking and plastering when it came to\r\nthe finishing up. The only boards about the entire building were in the\r\ndoor which I think were brought with us on top of our wagon-box, which\r\nwas of extra height. The joists above and below were made of logs, the\r\nupper ones squared with a broadax. The casings of doors and windows,\r\nand the floors above and below, were made out of bass wood puncheons.\r\nSlabs were spread out of the logs and then hewn out with a broad axe\r\nand the edges were made straight by the use of the chalk line. The\r\ngable ends were sided up with clapboard rived out of oak timber three\r\nor four feet long, and then shaved off smooth like siding. The rafters\r\nwere made of hickory poles trimmed off straight on the upper side, and\r\nstrips three or four inches wide were nailed on the sheeting. Upon\r\nthese strips shingles made of oak eighteen inches long and nicely\r\nshaven, were laid. The logs of the walls in the inside were hewn off\r\nflat, and the interstices between were shingled and plastered with lime\r\nmortar, the lime being burned by my father on Indian Creek. There were\r\nthree windows below of twelve lights each, with glass 7 x 9, and a\r\nwindow in each of the gable ends of nine lights, which furnished light\r\nfor the room above. The fire place was built up of logs on the outside\r\nand lined with stone within, and the chimney was built of sticks split\r\nout about the size of laths and plastered with clay, both inside and\r\noutside.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. H. VOSMEK Cedar Rapids]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FATHER T. J. SULLIVAN Cedar Rapids]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. E. L. MANSFIELD An Early Cedar Rapids Physician]\r\n\r\nThe description of this house gives the reader an idea of one of the\r\nmost up-to-date houses built before the year 1840. During the past\r\nsixty years many commodious farm houses have been erected, having all\r\nthe modern conveniences installed, such as heating, lighting, together\r\nwith bath privileges connected with sanitary plumbing. It is said that\r\nthe late S. C. Bever installed the first furnace in a dwelling house in\r\nLinn county, and many people came from over the county to see such a\r\nfurnace work. Now, not only cities and towns, but farm residences have\r\ninstalled furnaces and other kinds of heating plants, so that which was\r\na novelty fifty years ago is very ordinary today.\r\n\r\nThe farmers in Linn county early began to invest their surplus money in\r\nfarm machinery. William Ure drove an ox team to Chicago and brought\r\nback a McCormick reaper, which was the first reaper brought into the\r\ncounty, as far as is known. At least it was the first reaper used and\r\noperated in and around Scotch Grove. The neighbors said that Ure was\r\nfoolish and it would surely break him up, but inside of one season it\r\npaid for itself. In and around Stoney Point one of the first threshing\r\nmachines was used; a very small machine which was staked fast on the\r\nground, without a straw-carrier, and operated by horsepower, which was\r\nplaced on the ground loose and had to be hauled from place to place on\r\na truck. In Linn Grove, Brown township, Washington township, and in\r\nother localities, many of these crude reapers and crude threshing\r\nmachines and corn shellers were seen in operation during the season.\r\nFrequently the people who purchased these early machines lost money.\r\nThe machinery was not always recommended, and sometimes the farmers\r\nwere not mechanics skilled enough to make repairs when needed. A number\r\ngot fooled on the first wire-binders and on the check-rowers, as well\r\nas on some of the early mowing machines, and many lost heavily in early\r\ndays on thoroughbred horses and full-blooded cattle. But after all, the\r\nspirit of progress was abroad in the community, and in spite of\r\nfailures, it did a great thing for the people who became interested.\r\nThe advent of the reaper no doubt changed farming methods in this\r\ncountry. It is said that \"the struggle for bread ceased when the reaper\r\nwas put on the market.\" At least it placed the struggle for existence\r\non a higher level. Certainly when a machine was invented that could do\r\nthe work of five or six men and be depended upon, such a machine was\r\nworth having, and it soon paid for itself.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing of farm machinery in Linn county was not a financial\r\nsuccess, as is shown by the failure of the Williams Harvester Works,\r\nthe Ogden Plow Works, the Star Wagon Works, and many other enterprises,\r\nbut the spirit displayed by those who were willing to put their money\r\ninto these untried enterprises, showed the mettle and the ingenuity\r\nthat many of these early settlers had. People profited by these\r\nfailures, made a study of the subject, and in course of time these men\r\nwho lost at times on some investment or purchased machinery which was\r\nnot suitable to the country, became owners of magnificent farms and\r\nup-to-date farmers by long experience.\r\n\r\nThe early corn cribs and granaries were generally built of rails, the\r\nkinks filled in with straw or hay. They of course had to be rebuilt\r\nevery fall, and more or less grain was wasted. The rail corn crib was\r\nsuperseded by long board cribs generally built on the ground without\r\nany foundation. These cribs, when empty, were generally blown about the\r\npremises and had to be hauled back and propped up before they could be\r\nused in the fall. The farmers of Linn county frequently visited in\r\nIllinois, and there found models for economical corn cribs. They also\r\nread the farm journals, and it was not long until our farmers erected\r\nthe modern corn crib and granary with gasoline engines, dumps, and\r\nelevators. These cribs were substantially built on cement foundations\r\nwith cement floors, and with a driveway large enough and wide enough to\r\nhouse several wagons and three or four buggies at one time. The early\r\ncorn crib, it is true, cost little or nothing, but they were a source\r\nof expense and annoyance, and much grain was wasted. The modern corn\r\ncrib, as now erected, is built for a life time, but at a cost of from\r\ntwo thousand to three thousand dollars, which would have been a sum\r\nimpossible to raise by the early settler, who generally paid the\r\ngovernment price on his land by disposing of skins which he prepared\r\nduring the winter, and who went barefooted in summer for the reason\r\nthat he had no money to buy shoes and no time to make moccasins for\r\nhimself or his children.\r\n\r\nThus the early farmer housed his horses and cattle in straw stacks\r\nduring the winter and in the timber during the summer. Sometime a hay\r\nthatched stable was erected for the use of the horses. He milked his\r\ncows out on the snow in winter, and expected them to yield a fair\r\nsupply of milk on a diet of slough hay and dry corn stalks, and would\r\ndrive them to water to some creek or river once a day, using an ax with\r\nwhich to cut a hole in the ice. These stables would leak in spring and\r\nsummer and had to be rebuilt nearly every fall. All hay was stacked\r\noutside and nearly half of it would rot during the rainy season. But\r\nhay was cheaper than lumber and for that reason a man had to figure on\r\nputting up enough hay during the summer, and take into account the\r\nwaste. It was not till after the Civil war that many barns were built,\r\nand then only the rich farmer could afford them. Not till the '70s and\r\n'80s did the craze for barn building come, and now nearly every farm of\r\nany size, and nearly every farmer of any financial standing, has a good\r\nsubstantial barn, as well as machine sheds, all of which improvements\r\nmay cost from three thousand to ten thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the early days many farmers were fooled or taken in on the creamery\r\nproposition, as many of these small country creameries failed. The\r\npeople then began to study the cow and the cost of producing milk and\r\nbutter. True the first attempts were not a success, but the butter and\r\nmilk of Linn county have during the past twenty-five years made many of\r\nthe farmers wealthy. It used to be, that if the cows could keep down\r\nthe grocery bill that was well done, but now, many a farmer gets a\r\nmonthly milk check of from fifty to seventy-five dollars, which not\r\nonly pays the grocery bill, but generally the hired man as well. But\r\nthen the price of butter has increased from six cents to thirty, which\r\nmakes a difference. The butter has also gradually become a better\r\nquality, and is really worth more. It is taken care of now, while in\r\nthe pioneer days the cream was left out doors during the hot summer and\r\nthe rancid butter was placed in a shallow slough well so as to be kept\r\ncool. It was generally not fit to use and was traded at the store for\r\ndried prunes, brown sugar, and dried herring. Thus, while the farmer\r\nmay not have given the merchant much, the merchant certainly did not\r\ngive the farmer anything of much value in return for his farm produce.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years no class of people have fared better\r\nfinancially than the farmers, and no class of people have become more\r\nenlightened on the subject in which they are engaged than the farmers.\r\nThis may be due to several reasons. The farm journals have no doubt\r\ndone much in stirring up a local pride in the vocation of farming. The\r\nfarm journal has taught the farmer not to be ashamed of his calling;\r\nthat while he may be called a \"Rube\" in some localities, he is an\r\nintelligent, up-to-date, wide-awake man, who knows what is going on in\r\nthe country; is familiar with political questions and interested in the\r\nwelfare of the country and of the state in which he resides. During the\r\npast twenty years the farmer, especially in Linn county, has traveled\r\nmuch. He has attended the county and state fairs where he has seen the\r\nlatest inventions in machinery. He has attended nearly all of the\r\nexhibitions held in the country from Chicago to Seattle, and has come\r\nin contact with farmers from other sections of the country as well as\r\nwith financiers and men of affairs. He has traveled much on land\r\nexcursions and has learned to study and understand the nature of the\r\nsoil. While it is true, that these various journeys have taken some\r\ntime and money, yet they have made the farmer an up-to-date man,\r\nfamiliar with all sides of human life, and he has discovered, after\r\nall, that he is one of the most fortunate men in the country, and\r\nfinancially better off than many a city brother who may wear broadcloth\r\nand a boiled shirt, but whose bank account is generally depleted. The\r\nLinn county farmer has learned during the past twenty-five years to\r\nknow himself and to understand and respect the class to which he\r\nbelongs. No one can become a successful person in any line of business\r\nunless he is proud of the line of work in which he is engaged. The\r\nfarmer has learned this secret, and he is not ashamed to tell anyone,\r\nthat he is a Hawkeye farmer, owning his own farm and caring for his own\r\nproperty. The Iowa farmer has kept up with the procession, and he\r\ncertainly is as intelligent, as wide-awake, and as shrewd and keen as\r\nthe merchant, the banker, and the professional man in his business\r\ndealings. But he came to Iowa at the proper time, and for that reason\r\nhe had the advantage of the old settlers who came to New England or to\r\nJamestown. These men came ahead of their time and before things were\r\nripe for such settlement. The bread tools of the Virginia pioneer were\r\nthe same as those of the Indians whom they despised and wanted to drive\r\nout. The first settlers of Iowa came with the advent of the reaper,\r\nwhen a boy fifteen years of age could cut the grain with ease, which\r\nseveral sturdy men had to do before with the sickle and the scythe.\r\n\r\nWe seem to think that we have had the modern inventions for ages, but\r\nthe first white settlers in Linn county, whoever they may have been,\r\nknew nothing of matches; of stoves as we know them; of the telegraph or\r\nthe telephone or electric lights. They did not have modern corn\r\ncultivators or stirring plows. All these so-called modern appliances\r\nhave been invented since the advent of the first settler in this\r\ncounty. But it was not long after these inventions came into use, until\r\nsome enterprising individual or firm introduced them into Linn county.\r\nIt is said that it was at a Shriner meeting on the old State Fair\r\nGround, which is now Central Park, Cedar Rapids, that electricity was\r\nfirst used in this county, and people came for many miles to watch this\r\npeculiar light, which some thought could only be accounted for on the\r\nground that the operator was in close connection with the Evil One.\r\nBarnum, with his show, also exhibited electric lights to the\r\nconsternation of the vast crowds that came to see his circus, and it\r\nwas one of the chief attractions during the first year. People came\r\nmany miles to listen and talk through a telephone, and now every\r\nup-to-date farmer has an instrument installed in his own house.\r\n\r\nIn a material way the settlers in Linn county have succeeded beyond the\r\nexpectation of the most sanguine. Thrift and prosperity can be seen on\r\nevery hand. The various farmers' alliances, elevator companies, banking\r\ncompanies, creamery companies, old settlers' unions, and all these have\r\nbrought the men over the county in closer touch with each other and the\r\nfarmers of the whole county have learned to appreciate the marvelous\r\nbenefits derived from social intercourse. It has made them broader and\r\nmore liberal minded toward one another.\r\n\r\nThe first real census of the county was made in 1840 by H. W. Gray, who\r\nfound 1,373 men, women, and children here. There were no less than 200\r\npeople who celebrated the 4th of July at Westport in 1838, but these\r\nmay not all have belonged to the county. There was a rapid influx of\r\npeople, and by 1845 it has been estimated that no less than 4,000 had\r\ndeclared Linn county their permanent home. The men who came here in the\r\nearly days knew nothing of luxuries, for it is said that there were not\r\nover twenty buggies in the county and not to exceed two pianos. The\r\ngold excitement took many of the bright young men away, most of whom\r\nnever returned. The census of 1850 shows that there were 5,444 people\r\nin the county, further demonstrating that the land seekers were still\r\ncoming despite the fact that many residents must have left for the gold\r\nfields of California. By 1860 fully 19,000 residents claimed the county\r\nas their home. At the first election in the county 39 votes were cast.\r\nIn 1875 there were more than 7,000 voters, and this number has\r\ngradually increased till the votes cast in 1908 were 6,558 republican,\r\n5,008 democratic, 220 prohibition, and 121 scattering, making a total\r\nvote of 11,900. Long ago the farming districts were filled up and the\r\ncountry portions have not grown in population. The demand for pioneers\r\nhas ceased, and the growth henceforth will be in the cities and towns,\r\nand not in the country until such a time as the cities will be\r\ncompelled to expand or the people congregating therein will be enabled\r\nto seek the country to make a living. There may also come a time when\r\nthe large farms will be divided up among members of the family and when\r\nit will pay better to farm on a small rather than on a large scale. If\r\nthe land can be subdivided into small tracts, as in many parts of\r\nEurope, Iowa and Linn county will be able to feed a much larger\r\npopulation and at greater ease than can the exhausted lands of the old\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe soil in Iowa is as rich today and will if well cared for produce\r\nmore today than it did some forty years ago. The farmers will now\r\ndevote more of their time to make the farms yield more and not in the\r\npurchase of more lands as heretofore. What the modern farmer is now up\r\nagainst is better markets, cheaper freight charges, more local\r\nmanufacturing, and increased commercial conveniences.\r\n\r\nFor many years after the lands were taken up and cultivated the farmers\r\nwere unable to get rid of their products. There were no other markets\r\nthan the local ones. Robert Ellis had tried the experiment of running\r\nflat boats down the river and had returned without any profits. Holmes,\r\nthe Higley Brothers, Daniels, and others built flat boats at Ivanhoe\r\nand shipped wheat in the early spring down the Cedar and made a little\r\nmoney. But there was more or less risk, and much labor was expended,\r\nand the returns were not always satisfactory. Many teamed and hauled\r\ndressed pork, wheat, and barley to the Mississippi river, mostly to\r\nMuscatine, but after the driver returned and figured up his expenses\r\nand the cost of a few groceries and a calico dress for the wife, he had\r\nlittle left with which to pay interest and tax on the land.\r\n\r\nThe farmer was kept busy in paying taxes and breaking up and fencing\r\nmore land. To do these things and keep his family was all he could hope\r\nto accomplish. The business man who had come here was without funds,\r\nand interest rates were high. He could not borrow enough to carry out\r\nhis scheme of factory building, as he had expected. Saw mills and grist\r\nmills were erected so as to supply the local trade with enough\r\nmaterials for building, and enough food to live on, but that was all.\r\nThe cost of transportation was high, and the cost of anything like\r\nluxuries was so great that it was out of the question to purchase any.\r\nAs late as 1855 there were no markets and no means to ship anything out\r\nexcept by flat boats early in the spring of the year when the water was\r\nhigh. N. B. Brown started the first woolen mill as early as 1848. This\r\nwas later disposed of to the Bryan family, but the mill never was a\r\nreal success. There was no demand for the goods and the expense was too\r\nhigh to ship the raw products in and the finished products out. To haul\r\nany amount in a farm wagon a hundred miles over poor roads, subject to\r\nall kinds of weather, is not a success to the hauler nor to the man who\r\nhires him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HON. JAMES URE A Fairfax Pioneer]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUDGE JAMES H. ROTHROCK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. J. DANIELS Early Linn County Official]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L. J. PALDA Cedar Rapids]\r\n\r\nEven after the railroad was brought to Cedar Rapids the people did not\r\nrealize that there was any other but a local market for any product.\r\nDuring the early years of the war, from 1862-3, the people awoke to a\r\nrealization that it would pay to get in touch with a larger market, and\r\nthe Chicago prices on stuff began to be quoted. R. D. Stephens built an\r\nelevator at Marion and began sending corn to the river. Cattle and hogs\r\nbegan to go up in price, and soon the people realized that the railroad\r\nwas not built to carry passengers only, but freight as well, and that\r\non a large scale.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the number of acres assessed was 452,486, and the land,\r\nexclusive of towns and villages, amounted to $3,012,754. The assessment\r\nfor Linn county in 1878 was 449,774 acres, $5,127,133. The actual\r\nvaluation in 1855 was about three and one-half millions, while in 1900\r\nthe taxable valuation of the county was something over twelve millions.\r\n\r\nButter and cheese making were at one time businesses which made the\r\nfarmers much money, but not till they learned how to prepare good\r\nbutter and get a market established for it. Soon agents came to Iowa\r\nlooking over the crops, and presently few towns were without local\r\nagents who handled stock and grain on a commission basis.\r\n\r\nHenceforth it was the Chicago market and not the local market that\r\ngoverned, and the railroads were loaded down many seasons of the year\r\nin hauling train load after train load of corn and wheat and cattle and\r\nhogs, the property of the Iowa farmers. Iowa became in a short time the\r\nfood producing state in the Mississippi Valley and has so remained till\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nIt was the productiveness of the soil, the manner in which the soil was\r\nprepared and the prices for farm products that made the land valuable.\r\nAnd it was the outside market that made farm produce worth the price it\r\nwas for a local market cannot do this. The Chicago market has become\r\nthe world market on many commodities, and lucky is the person who owns\r\nlands within a safe radius of such a market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_Rural Life_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rural life of the pioneers in Linn county was much the same as it\r\nwas in any of the adjoining counties in eastern Iowa. The settlers were\r\nintelligent, young, active, and enthusiastic, believing in the future\r\nof the new State. The men were able to do nearly all kinds of\r\nmechanical work without any help or assistance, while the women were\r\nequally dextrous in spinning, weaving, and doing all kinds of house\r\nwork. They were all clad in homespun and no false standards were\r\nmaintained by the so-called well-to-do.\r\n\r\nWheat was the product for many years until the pest took it, and Indian\r\ncorn was grown. It was soon found that wheat was expensive to raise, as\r\nseed was high, the cost of harvesting expensive, and frequently a\r\nshower or a storm when the wheat was ripe destroyed a great deal of it,\r\nso the farmer's summer work at times would be entirely gone. It cost\r\nless to raise corn, and in course of time a market was found for it,\r\nalthough it scarcely ever sold for more than 30 cents a bushel.\r\n\r\n\"In ye olden times\" master and servant had no trouble. They ate at the\r\nsame table, worked side by side during the day, and it was a sort of\r\npartnership affair throughout the season from the early spring until\r\nthe crops were gathered in the fall. During the entire season the hired\r\nman had handled scarcely a dollar and he had taken up at the village\r\nstore on credit in the master's name goods that would not exceed in\r\nvalue ten or fifteen dollars. While it has been often stated that in\r\nthe pioneer days the men were overworked and underpaid, which might be\r\ntrue in part, still during these formative years, when everything was\r\nnew, and there were no classes, all settlers were on the same\r\nlevel--socially and financially. It was not long until the hired man\r\nhad worked long enough to get sufficient money to make a first payment\r\non a farm, and in a few years the renter became a land owner and well\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nThe scattered settlers during the early years of their residence in\r\nLinn county relied on their own ingenuity for everything they needed;\r\nthus, they were their own blacksmiths, cabinet makers, carpenters,\r\ntanners, stone masons, and shoe makers. They would tan their own\r\nleather, shoe their own horses and oxen, make their own crude harness,\r\nand get along and be satisfied. While they would depend on the village\r\nblacksmith and on the wagon maker, roads were impassable in the spring\r\nof the year and a yoke of oxen was not the swiftest means of getting to\r\nand from a town twenty-five or thirty miles away. Hence a farmer who\r\nhad any ingenuity at all, would rather do his own work in a crude way,\r\nthan have to go to town to get anything repaired which was broken.\r\n\r\nMuch amusement was also had in the early days in the various\r\ncommunities where men and women enjoyed meeting together at social\r\nfunctions. There were quilting bees, spelling schools, barn raisings,\r\nlog rolling, debating schools, singing schools, and many other\r\ngatherings which frequently ended with a barn dance or a house warming\r\nsupper, provided by the host and hostess.\r\n\r\nThe winter season in \"ye olden times\" was not an easy time of it by any\r\nmeans, for the pioneers went to the timber early in the morning and\r\nwould stay all day and until late at night, cutting wood, making rails\r\nand getting big logs to the saw mills. It mattered not what was the\r\nkind of weather, the young man would start off to the timber with the\r\nthermometer frequently at from twenty-five to thirty below zero.\r\nSometimes it would be pleasant in the morning when they started out,\r\nbut frequently a severe blizzard would come up before night, and many\r\nwere the frozen hands and ears they would bring home to thaw out late\r\nat night, having been out all day in the most severe weather. But as\r\nsoon as it was over it was forgotten, and the next day or the next week\r\nthe young man would again repeat the same performance.\r\n\r\nWhile the men were strong, active, and hardworking, the women were\r\nequally active, persevering and industrious. The girls always took care\r\nof the milk and butter; the straining of the milk was done by the\r\nslough well or in a dark mud cellar, with no stone in it, and which\r\nalways kept caving in until the entire house had to be put on pillars.\r\nThe wife frequently had the family washing out by sunrise and the hired\r\ngirl, if the family could afford one, would work side by side with her\r\nmistress and would do both inside and outside work if needed. No one\r\nwas afraid to work: in fact they were all proud of what they had\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThere were not many varieties of dishes on the table in pioneer days,\r\nand still the settlers had plenty of good, wholesome food, and were\r\nalways hungry. Salt pork, johnny cake, honey, and game were the\r\ncustomary foods of the farmer in ye olden times. They scarcely ever\r\ntasted fresh meat from spring until fall, unless some of the boys shot\r\na little game now and then. The settlers were companionable, good\r\nnatured, and contented. They traded cattle, horses, mules, and at times\r\nfarms, only now and then would trouble arise as one would accuse\r\nanother of smart dealings, and a lawsuit would ensue. It is related of\r\nan itinerant preacher who purchased a yoke of oxen from one of the\r\ndeacons in the church, that while he was testing the oxen on a hot\r\nSunday driving to church with his family, the yoke squatted down in a\r\nmud hole and remained there and it was impossible to move them at all.\r\nThe preacher spied the deacon coming to church and was not slow in\r\ntelling him what he thought of him as well as the oxen he had sold him.\r\nThe deacon was not at all worried but replied, \"parson, you must not\r\nforget to swear at 'em, that is the only thing they know,\" and drove on\r\nas though not at all offended by the remarks of the preacher.\r\n\r\nIn the early days the farmers had no cisterns, no wind mills, no deep\r\nwells. Rain water was gathered in barrels which dried up in summer and\r\nfroze solid in winter, so the house wife had scarcely any rain water\r\neither summer or winter. The well was generally a ten foot shallow well\r\ndug down by the slough, poorly planked, and frequently it caved in;\r\nanother well was dug much in the same manner as the old one, the new\r\nwell soon meeting with the same ending as the former one.\r\n\r\nThere were few, if any, barns in the olden times and straw thatched\r\nsheds and stables were universally used. These stables were moved\r\nfrequently for the reason that the farmers failed to haul out the\r\nmanure which accumulated, finding that it was easier and cheaper to\r\nmove the stable than to haul away the manure. Nearly all of the hay was\r\nstacked out doors and had to be cut and hauled away in order to be fed\r\nto the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe farmers were slow and backward in many things. They possessed no\r\nspirit of restlessness and took things coolly, relying, it seems, on\r\nthe old adage which says that \"he who drives with oxen also gets\r\nthere.\" While they early built fairly good houses, they were slow in\r\nerecting buildings and comfortable places for their horses and cattle,\r\nand it was many years before they began to erect sheds and buildings\r\nfor their machinery. Wagons without spring seats sold at from $100.00\r\nto $125.00; reapers and mowing machines were very expensive and they\r\nwere generally only a few of these in each neighborhood. The household\r\nfurniture was cheap and simple; there were no such things as furnaces\r\nor hard coal burners. Mostly old stoves were in use for the burning of\r\nwood, and these perhaps were second hand, or at least had seen better\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe young man in pioneer days generally started out in life with an ox\r\nteam, a breaking plow, and a wagon. The wages for breaking were from\r\n$1.00 to $2.00 an acre, and when he was not breaking he would often be\r\nrunning a threshing machine or working in the saw mill or in the timber\r\ngetting out logs. When ox teams were used for breaking, it took one to\r\ndrive and one to hold the plow in the ground. A person generally broke\r\nmore land than he could fence, and it was no use to sow wheat and not\r\nfence, for in those days the law permitted cattle and horses to run at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nCorn was not cultivated on the new ground to any extent, except that\r\neach one raised enough corn for his own use but no more. The corn was\r\ngenerally put in by hand, plowed only once or twice with a single\r\nshovel plow pulled by one old nag.\r\n\r\nIn the early days all the cooking was done by the open fireplace; such\r\nan article as a stove was not much known. Corn bread and pork, with rye\r\ncoffee, formed the average bill of fare at the wayside inn and at the\r\nfarm house. The boarders actually preferred pork to venison; they got\r\ntired of game--it was so plentiful. Many a pioneer farmer could shoot\r\nfrom five to ten deer near his door before breakfast.\r\n\r\nIn ye olden times nearly everyone would attend church, especially in\r\nsummer. While many did not belong to any church, yet they were all\r\ninterested in it. They supported the churches to the best of their\r\nability. The influence of the country church did much in making this a\r\ncounty which still shows the effect of the early training and of the\r\nefforts of itinerant preachers and laymen who went from place to place\r\nvisiting the scattered congregations. Such preachers as Troup, Searles,\r\nIngham, J. Hodges, Hayden, Twing, Maxin, Dudley, Rankin, Boal,\r\nCunningham, Keeler, Phelps, Roberts, Jones, Elias Skinner, Father\r\nEmmons and many of the early itinerant ministers did much to build up\r\nchurches in this county. Then there were a number of laymen in various\r\ndenominations who maintained in part some of the associations\r\nthemselves, such as Tom Lewis, Levi Lewis, Chandler Jordan, Henry\r\nRogers, and the Kurtzes, Runkles, Shueys, and many of the early\r\nsettlers in and around Lisbon. The community around Mt. Vernon was also\r\nmuch influenced by the college atmosphere and by the itinerant\r\npreachers who visited the scattered members in Franklin township. These\r\nare only a few of many such communities where an interest was kept up\r\nin the small country churches where large congregations gathered weekly\r\nfor meditation and for prayer. Many old pioneer families did much to\r\nhelp the church.\r\n\r\nOne can converse with the old pioneer now, and he still loves to recall\r\nthe old times, the old haunts and the wayside places. It was by some\r\nrail fence that a rural maiden had whispered to him as a young man,\r\nthat the pain in her heart no human touch but his own could heal. It\r\nwas here loved ones had spoken as they chattered away in childish\r\nwhispers, when he came home from ended labors, and it was here that he\r\ntook his family on Sunday to the little church where they all bowed\r\nsilently in prayer, full of the faith and the hope which made his heart\r\nstrong and his footsteps light. The simple mode of living in Linn\r\ncounty in an early date made strong men and courageous women. They were\r\nbrought up to withstand the temptations of life and to despise the\r\nfalse veneer of a later generation. They lived up to the ideals of\r\ntheir way of thinking, and left sturdy families who grew up in the\r\nsimple ways of the pioneer, themselves dutiful sons and daughters of\r\nthe old settlers who came here in any early day to make homes for\r\nthemselves and their descendants.\r\n\r\nTruly, the pioneers should be remembered for what they accomplished,\r\nfor well might they sing with the poet:\r\n\r\n     \"Fading away like the stars of the morning,\r\n       Losing our light in the rising sun;\r\n     Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling\r\n       Only remembered by what we have done.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE AT THE PALISADES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PALISADES OF THE CEDAR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_A Hero of the Canadian Rebellion_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat promised to have been a war to death in Linn county in the early\r\n'40s terminated because one of our old settlers, then a young man, said\r\nwhat he knew to be the fact and was willing to back it up with force.\r\nThe interesting story is as follows: Political dissension had prevailed\r\nin Canada since 1820, and an open rebellion broke out in 1837. In lower\r\nCanada it began among the French settlers who wanted equality and their\r\nrights as Frenchmen, while in upper Canada it was brought about by\r\nleaders of the radical party insisting on a democratic form of\r\ngovernment. The rebellion was lead by Lyon Mackenzie, a native of\r\nScotland who had taken up journalism in Canada. The spirit of rebellion\r\nextended also into the United States, and many so-called filibusters\r\njoined the insurrectionists from a spirit of adventure. The papers\r\nmentioned in lengthy articles these so-called leaders, one especially\r\nbeing given much notoriety, one William Johnson, who, after the\r\nrebellion was put down, lived on one of the Thousand Islands in the St.\r\nLawrence and evaded capture. His daughter, Kate, it was said, brought\r\nhim food and the soldiers were unable to locate the hiding place of\r\nthis rebel who defied the government militia.\r\n\r\nRobert Ellis met this so-called Bill Johnson at Prairie du Chien,\r\nWisconsin, in 1842. Johnson asserted with a great deal of gusto that he\r\nhad escaped from the Islands and was going to make his home among the\r\nfree people out on the borders. He was accompanied by a woman he\r\nclaimed to be his daughter who received as much attention as the\r\nvaliant soldier himself. Johnson drifted into Ft. Atkinson and finally\r\nlocated on a claim two miles above Quasqueton, on the north bank of the\r\nWapsie river. Here he became a sort of feudal lord, told exaggerated\r\nstories about his valor, and was surrounded by a number of frontier\r\nsoldiers who claimed to have fought in the war of 1812, as well as in\r\nthe Canadian rebellion. For a time Captain Bill Johnson was idolized as\r\nno other person in this part of Iowa, and it is certain that his\r\ndaughter Kate was laid siege to by more than one border hero under the\r\nguise of suitor.\r\n\r\nIt was not long until the arrogant ways of Captain Bill Johnson, who\r\njumped a claim, offended an old settler by the name of Henry Bennett,\r\nwho resided near Quasqueton, and who was one of the first settlers in\r\nthat community. Attempted arrests were made pro and con, but the\r\nBennett party was successful and they drove Captain Johnson out of the\r\ncommunity, after a sound flogging. He drifted into Marion and put up at\r\nthe Phillips Hotel, telling stories of Bennett's abuse, how his\r\nproperty had been taken, and how he had been driven out of the county\r\nlike a criminal. He wanted redress. The good people of Marion believed\r\nthese stories, and soon a company was organized and provided with\r\nweapons of war to surround Bennett and demand restitution. A number of\r\nthe old settlers of Marion were mustered into this company, such as\r\nGeorge Patterson, Col. Durham, and others of the well known residents.\r\nIt was in the winter of 1843, but that did not keep any of the company\r\naway from a forced march to Quasqueton. Bennett had friends and\r\nadmirers also, and being made aware of the proposed attack he fortified\r\nhis camp, laid in a supply of food, and had his guns ready. The\r\nattacking party demanded restitution, but the old man shook his head\r\nand told them to come on. The besiegers had to camp out, while\r\nBennett's followers were well housed and warm. Finally the attacking\r\narmy ran out of provisions, and after a council of war in which the\r\npeace loving spirit prevailed, they decided to return to the quiet\r\nhaunts of Marion.\r\n\r\nJohnson still kept up his abuse of Bennett and his friends, and when\r\nthat did not satisfy would resort to tales of his wonderful escapades\r\non the St. Lawrence and how he had evaded the British officers with the\r\nassistance of his daughter, Kate. The good people at first entertained\r\nhim as a guest, and he was always willing to accept of their\r\nhospitality, but stories were circulated that this so-called daughter,\r\nKate, was not his daughter at all. But Bill Johnson still remained,\r\nhaving a number of supporters.\r\n\r\nOne night Robert Ellis entered the Phillips Hotel while Johnson was\r\nheaping abuse on the Bennett party and on the courts of Iowa, telling\r\nGen. James Wilson, who was surveyor-general of the territory, the story\r\nof his abuse. He said, that the day before he and his crowd had tracked\r\nBennett as far as Delhi where the party escaped, being assisted by\r\nWilliam Abbe, a prominent settler of Linn county. This was too much for\r\nEllis, and he replied as follows: \"That is not true, as Wm. Abbe drove\r\nfrom Ft. Atkinson with me, and we arrived in Marion today, and we were\r\ntogether all of the time.\" Johnson was full of \"wrath and cabbage.\" He\r\narose and in a much injured manner said, \"You might as well call me a\r\nliar as to say that,\" to which Ellis replied, \"If that suits you any\r\nbetter I can call you a liar, because that is what you are, if you want\r\nus to believe what you have been saying here tonight. You have been\r\ntelling lies about my friend Abbe.\" Johnson pulled off his coat and was\r\nabout to strike him, when Mr. Ellis spied a hickory stick in the wood\r\nbox. With that he went after Johnson, who quietly retreated, put on his\r\ncoat, engaged in conversation with Wilson, and the matter for the time\r\ndropped. The story leaked out that this Canadian boaster was nothing\r\nbut a coward, and there were grave doubts as to whether or not he was\r\nthe person he claimed to be. Finally so much opposition arose against\r\nhim that he left Marion--much to the satisfaction of the people of the\r\ncounty for they had seen and heard things which reflected against\r\nJohnson's relations with his so-called daughter.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Robert Ellis drifted into the gold camps of Sacramento Valley\r\non the American river, and who should he find out there but the\r\ndaughter of Bill Johnson, now the wife of one of the miners. He learned\r\nthat Bill Johnson had drifted into Southern Iowa and Missouri, where he\r\nassumed his old attitude, expecting free board and considerable\r\nconsideration, but the pioneers in that community had to be \"shown\" and\r\ncared not much for what Johnson had been; the question was what he was\r\nthen. A suitor in Mahaska county came to see his alleged daughter, but\r\nBogus Johnson opposed and threatened him with dire disaster if he came\r\nwithin shooting distance. The suitor was not at all scared, having\r\nlived on the frontier longer than Johnson. The woman may have regretted\r\nthe double life she had been living, and perhaps with her\r\nassistance--no one knows--Johnson was killed in a quarrel by the\r\nsuitor, it was alleged, and prosecutions followed. The suitor and Kate\r\nafter a long trial then drifted to California, and there Robert Ellis\r\nfound them and heard the story that Captain Bill Johnson, once the\r\nterror of this part of Iowa, was a bogus Bill Johnson, and the light\r\nhaired Kate was not the Kate of story and fiction at all. If it had not\r\nbeen for the obstreperous Bennett on the Wapsie and for the hickory\r\nstick in the hands of Robert Ellis bogus Bill Johnson might have\r\nterrorized this community much longer than he did.\r\n\r\nAnother story was also told shortly after Johnson left by one of\r\nJohnson's henchmen, an old soldier, which shows the bad character and\r\ndisposition of Johnson. William Abbe, one of the early settlers, and at\r\none time a member of the legislature of Iowa, being in the employ of\r\nthe government, having a contract to deliver provisions at Ft.\r\nAtkinson, was about to return to his home in Linn Grove, which fact was\r\nknown to Johnson. The soldier related after Johnson's hasty departure\r\nthat he and Johnson had entered into an agreement to blackmail Abbe and\r\nget some money out of him by inviting Abbe to remain in the Johnson\r\ncabin over night and then to threaten Abbe that he had assaulted the\r\ndaughter of Johnson while accepting of his hospitality. Johnson was to\r\nremain in hiding while the soldier was set out on the trail to watch\r\nfor Abbe and invite him to the cabin. This was done and the soldier sat\r\nout in the timber watching for Abbe during the afternoon and evening,\r\nbut fortunately Abbe failed to make his appearance as expected and the\r\ndeep laid plan fell through.\r\n\r\nBill Johnson, whatever he may have been, was certainly an expert in his\r\nline and seemed to ingratiate himself into the good graces of many\r\nprominent people. He obtained the assistance and help of Governor\r\nChambers, as well as Surveyor-General James Wilson, and many others in\r\nthe various law suits which he had with the members of the Bennett\r\nparty. General Wilson, as is well known, was a native of New Hampshire\r\nand on account of the personal friendship of Daniel Webster had been\r\nappointed to this office by President Harrison. Webster had intended to\r\nslate his friend Wilson for Governor of Iowa, but Harrison had\r\nappointed his private secretary and former aide-de camp, Colonel John\r\nChambers. Thus General Wilson had to accept the only vacancy left, that\r\nof surveyor-general. On his trip over Iowa, General Wilson was\r\naccompanied by his daughter, Mary E. Wilson, better known as Mrs. John\r\nSherwood, who later became one of the best known writers and society\r\nwomen on two continents. It was at Marion, according to the report of\r\nRobert Ellis, that Johnson first met General Wilson and that the\r\nfriendship sprang up between them, and it seemed as though Johnson had\r\nknown a number of Wilson's relatives and a great many of the prominent\r\nmen in New England. It is thought, of course, that Johnson imposed upon\r\nGeneral Wilson and no doubt used the names of parties he had known of\r\nin some way to further his own selfish purposes.\r\n\r\nThe following may be quoted from the _History of Washington County_.\r\nVol. I, p. 326, as told by H. A. Burrell:\r\n\r\n     \"A Mahaska county murder case of Job Peck, the murderer of\r\n     Wm. Johnson, came here on a change of venue September 9,\r\n     1843; it was a melodrama: A cultivated Canadian\r\n     revolutionist, a beautiful girl Kit claiming to be his\r\n     daughter, horsethieves, etc., being the personæ dramatis, an\r\n     elopement and kidnapping constituting the action of the\r\n     piece. The Canuck was shot in his cabin and a lover of Kit\r\n     was held for the crime. Kit was spirited to Pittsburg, Pa.,\r\n     and the lover proved an alibi; he had married Kit near\r\n     Fairfield. While in jail here he did not know his bride's\r\n     whereabouts nor for several months after, but he finally\r\n     found her with fine people. They lived near Oskaloosa for\r\n     years when they went to California. Who she was, was never\r\n     known; she denied that Johnson was her father; he may have\r\n     been her husband. After Peck's death she married again and\r\n     had a noble family and was called the Queen of the Thousand\r\n     Isles--in oil business. Johnson was the subject of state\r\n     correspondence between the United States and England. A\r\n     British subject, he revolted, turned renegade and spy in\r\n     1812, and robbed the mails to get information. Both\r\n     countries offered a reward for him and he fled to the\r\n     Isles.\"\r\n\r\nHow much truth there is in the above it is difficult to say. It is at\r\nleast based on hearsay. Colonel Durham knew Johnson well and was one of\r\nhis friends in the Quasqueton affair, and Robert Ellis also knew him,\r\nas well as the members of the Abbe family. Whether Johnson was a\r\nCanadian or a citizen of the United States or had anything to do with\r\nthe war of 1812 is uncertain. At least in Linn county he claimed to be\r\nthe Bill Johnson of Canadian fame. For that reason he introduced this\r\nyoung woman as his daughter to carry out the story, as the original\r\nJohnson did have a daughter who carried news as well as food to him in\r\nhis hiding.\r\n\r\nTo supplement the above account may be mentioned the following from the\r\n\"Early History of Dubuque,\" as written by L. H. Langworthy, and printed\r\nin the _Iowa Journal of History and Politics_, July, 1910:\r\n\r\n     \"In 1843 a most ludicrous affair occurred. A villainous\r\n     fellow palmed himself upon the people of Buchanan county as\r\n     the renowned patriot and celebrated hero of the Thousand\r\n     Isles, Bill Johnson. This man, with his daughter Miss Kate\r\n     Johnson, was suspected, it seems, of being any other than\r\n     the far-famed Canadian patriot, by the citizens of Buchanan\r\n     county, who thought fit to take Johnson out in the night,\r\n     tie him to a tree and whip him severely with fifty lashes on\r\n     his naked back. The offenders were arraigned before Judge\r\n     Wilson. The court house was crowded by hundreds of eager\r\n     spectators who listened with intense interest to the\r\n     proceedings: all anxious to see the laws of our country\r\n     administered faithfully. The prisoners' names were Evans,\r\n     Spencer, Parrish, and Rowley, charged with burglary and\r\n     riot. It appeared that these defendants accompanied by\r\n     several other white men and five or six Indians after\r\n     lynching Johnson, ordered him and his daughter to pack up\r\n     their goods and be off in two hours, and not to return at\r\n     the peril of their lives. Great sympathy was felt for this\r\n     Johnson and the two tender females of his household, who\r\n     were thrown out in the depth of winter and obliged to travel\r\n     twenty-five miles over a cold and bleak prairie; so cold\r\n     that it froze one of the lynchers themselves to death,\r\n     another lost his feet, and several others were severely\r\n     frozen. The citizens here declared that Johnson looked as if\r\n     he was born to command, and betokened in every action that\r\n     he was the same old Bill Johnson, the hero of the Thousand\r\n     Isles, the Canadian patriot, and the great friend of human\r\n     liberty and republican institutions; while all the young\r\n     bloods of the town declared that Miss Kate Johnson was a\r\n     very intelligent and interesting young lady, with rare\r\n     accomplishments, agreeable manners and the worthy daughter\r\n     of a gallant sire. The case was conducted on the part of the\r\n     prosecution by James Crawford and General James Wilson; on\r\n     the part of the defense by James Churchman and I. M.\r\n     Preston: the counsel on both sides in their speeches were\r\n     truly eloquent, they were fine efforts of legal talent, and\r\n     so great was the interest taken in this trial that the\r\n     ladies attended in goodly numbers until a late hour at\r\n     night, determined to hear all the proceedings and speeches\r\n     to which the occasion gave rise. Miss Kate Johnson received\r\n     great attention and unequalled admiration as the celebrated\r\n     heroine and daughter of the renowned patriot of the Thousand\r\n     Isles. The jury after being out a short time returned a\r\n     verdict of guilty; one was sentenced to the penitentiary for\r\n     two years and the others to a fine of two hundred dollars,\r\n     which imprisonment and fines however were afterwards\r\n     remitted; for lo, and behold! the next thing we hear of the\r\n     hero of the isles, is that he has grossly imposed himself\r\n     upon the citizens of the place, he being a different man\r\n     altogether from the Bill Johnson whom he represented, of a\r\n     different name and style of character, a great thief and\r\n     scoundrel. Letters were received showing these facts. The\r\n     next news received from him by our crestfallen beaux of\r\n     Dubuque, was that a Mr. Peck, a respectable man in Mahaska\r\n     county, the place to which the family had removed, fell in\r\n     love with Johnson's daughter, the heroic Kate, who returned\r\n     his love. But old Bill would not give his consent to the\r\n     marriage. So the two turtles fled to an adjoining county\r\n     where they were united in bonds matrimonial. It was some\r\n     time before the reputed father knew where his reputed\r\n     daughter had gone. But as soon as he did, he pursued her and\r\n     entered the house of Peck with pistol in hand and took her\r\n     away unmolested. But a few days afterwards while Johnson was\r\n     sitting in his own house he was shot through the heart with\r\n     a rifle ball from between the chinks of the logs. Peck was\r\n     arrested, but on trial acquitted. The lineage of the heroine\r\n     was traced back to an obscure family in Ohio, her history\r\n     and romance closing alike in contempt and infamy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARNEY McSHANE CABIN Built in 1847 Near Springville]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CABIN IN \"CRACKER SETTLEMENT\" NEAR MT. VERNON]\r\n\r\n     \"The young swains, and especially the editorial gallants,\r\n     who were so greatly enamored with the charms of Miss\r\n     Katherine Johnson while in our city, often rallied each\r\n     other afterwards on the subject; and some who appeared from\r\n     their newspaper eulogies to be the most moon-struck while\r\n     the romance lasted, and had written the largest amount of\r\n     very soft poetry on the lovely daughter of the hero of the\r\n     Thousand Isles, were the first to forget the object of their\r\n     adoration. Alas for the fickleness of man's affection and\r\n     the mutability of his attachments.\"\r\n\r\nThe above tells the story of how much trouble the various communities\r\nin Iowa had with bogus Bill Johnson and the various interpretations of\r\nthe life and character of the outlaw and his alleged daughter. Mr.\r\nEllis still insists that his interpretation of the life and character\r\nof this outlaw is as he tells it and no one perhaps knew the principal\r\ncharacters better than he did. Mr. Ellis was the first one who met\r\nJohnson in Wisconsin as he was about to emigrate into Iowa. He was one\r\nof the actors in the occurrence at the Phillips House in Marion, he was\r\nthe old friend and companion of William Abbe and knew most of the men\r\nin the Bennett party, such as Evans, Parrish, Rowley, and others, and\r\nhe met in California many years afterwards the heroine who had become\r\nthe wife of Peck and there had a conversation with both of them. Mr.\r\nEllis is of the opinion that when Johnson suddenly left Marion he went,\r\nto Missouri and later drifted back into Mahaska county, Iowa, where he\r\nwas murdered. It was thought that Kate knew more about the murder than\r\nshe let on, but living a life as she had lived it would not be best for\r\nher to tell all she knew of the various transactions with her so-called\r\nfather. So far as Mr. Ellis ascertained Kate had reformed and carried\r\nherself in goodly repute among the miners of the far west where she was\r\nthen known, it is said, at times as the Queen of the Thousand Isles.\r\nHer husband, it is stated, was a reputable person and had always stood\r\nwell in the community up to the time of the Johnson murder, and what\r\npart, if any, he took in that no one ever knew.\r\n\r\nBogus Bill Johnson is said to be buried in an unknown grave in Mahaska\r\ncounty and no stone has ever been found that marked his last resting\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nKate, Queen of the Thousand Isles, sleeps in one of the mountain\r\nvalleys of the Sierras on the Pacific slope and no one knows just when\r\nshe died or where she was buried. The dual lives of the characters in\r\nthis drama ended as all such lives do end, in infamy and disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_The Newspapers of the County_\r\n\r\nBY FREDERICK J. LAZELL\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the days of the early settlers until now the newspapers of Linn\r\ncounty have been among the most potent factors in the upbuilding of the\r\ncommunity. They have been, as a rule, constructive newspapers. Their\r\nmission has been to build up, to help their communities grow in wealth\r\nand influence. The newspapers of the county have been noted for their\r\nsagacity and their breadth of vision, their conservatism and their\r\ntolerance. They have exerted a strong and a wholesome influence upon\r\nthis and adjoining counties. In the state at large their influence for\r\ngood has not been small.\r\n\r\nThe old adage that the good die young has not been true of Linn\r\ncounty's newspapers. The best papers today are those which were started\r\nin the earliest days of the various towns in this county. They have\r\nprospered as their respective communities have prospered. Their\r\npublishers and editors have been, for the most part, men with personal\r\nand property interests in their respective communities. That is why\r\nthey have been builders and boosters. Linn county's proud position\r\namong the counties of the state, commercially, intellectually, and\r\npolitically, is largely due to the fact that men of ability and\r\nintegrity have worked and written and fought for the things they knew\r\nwould be helpful to their constituents. And this is as true of the\r\nweekly newspapers as it is of the daily press. Very few counties in the\r\nstate have had such an able corps of newspaper writers.\r\n\r\nThere were some weaklings, papers which were born and soon died. There\r\nhave been a few freak newspapers. But not many. There have also been\r\nmany able, brilliant young newspaper men who did good work in the Linn\r\ncounty editorial and newspaper offices for awhile and then left for\r\nlarger fields of labor. Some of the county's ablest politicians and\r\nsome of its most prominent business men have occasionally dabbled in\r\nnewspapering, for the sake of some party or some pet project they were\r\nanxious to push through. That was in the earlier days. There has been\r\nvery little of it in the county of late years.\r\n\r\nIn the main the newspaper men of the county have been men to the manner\r\nborn, with a knowledge of the business from the ground up, men to whom\r\nthe smell of printer's ink is as essential to their enjoyment of life\r\nas the scent of the sea to a sailor. If, as Elbert Hubbard tells us,\r\nart is the expression of man's joy in his work, then nine-tenths of the\r\nnewspaper men of Linn county have been real artists, for they have\r\nstuck to their papers when they might have made heaps more money in\r\nsome other line of business. But this love of the work so\r\ncharacteristic among the brethren of the Linn county press doubtless\r\nhas something to do with the fact that their readable papers are read\r\nand quoted by the readers of other papers, from one end of the state to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nNo chronological list of the newspapers of Linn county has been\r\npublished, but it is interesting and instructive, and worthy of\r\npreservation in permanent form:\r\n\r\n     1851 _The Progressive Era_, started by D. O. Finch, in Cedar\r\n     Rapids.\r\n\r\n     1852 _The Prairie Star_, started at Marion by A. Hoyt. Same\r\n     year the name was changed to the _Linn County Register_, by\r\n     J. H. and G. H.

C. Barber.\r\n\r\n     1909 _West Side Enterprise_, started December 30th by W. I.\r\n     Endicott, owner and publisher.\r\n\r\nMuch of the early history of Linn county, and more especially of Cedar\r\nRapids, is interwoven with the history of the _Progressive Era_, which\r\nafterwards became the _Cedar Rapids Times_. The _Progressive Era_ was\r\nestablished by D. O. Finch in 1851. It was democratic in politics and\r\nclaimed to be devoted to the interests of Cedar Rapids and Linn county.\r\nIt was a seven column, four page paper, and rather a credit to the town\r\nat that time. Worse papers have been published since.\r\n\r\nIt was but a short time until Mr. Finch had all the newspaper\r\nexperience he wanted. Joseph Greene then purchased the paper and ran it\r\nuntil 1854. During this time Ezra Van Metre, James J. Child, Esq., and\r\nJames L. Enos were successively its editors.\r\n\r\nJames L. Enos had something to do with nearly every paper that was\r\nstarted during the early days of Linn county. He loved the smell of\r\nprinter's ink. The types had a fascination for him. He delighted to see\r\nhis thoughts reproduced in print. In September, 1854, he and F.\r\nAugustus Williams purchased Mr. Greene's interest in the _Progressive\r\nEra_. They changed the name to the _Cedar Valley Times_. They changed\r\nthe politics of the paper from democratic to the new Americanism of\r\nthat time. Then came the organization of the republican party. Like\r\nother adherents to the American party living in the north, the editors\r\nof the _Times_ cast in their lot with the new republican party and\r\nwarmly advocated and defended the principles on which it was founded.\r\n\r\nOne J. G. Davenport figures also in the early history of the _Times_.\r\nHe had acquired an interest in the paper, and during the campaign he\r\nwas its nominal editor, although there were not wanting those who\r\ndeclared that he had not the ability to write a three line notice of a\r\nchurch supper, let alone an editorial. Anyway, he made the _Times_ his\r\nstepping stone into the postmaster's seat, and his conduct of that\r\noffice was such that an investigation of his shortages followed. His\r\nbondsmen, one of whom was the late J. J. Snouffer, made good the loss,\r\nand shortly afterwards Davenport, after some more operations of a minor\r\ncharacter and similar nature, left Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThey were rare old political fighters in those days. Politics, rather\r\nthan news, was the chief end and aim of the owner of a newspaper. When\r\nGreene, Merritt & Co. closed out Davenport, having held a bill of sale\r\non the _Times_ office, the Times was made the personal organ of Colonel\r\nWilliam H. Merritt in his campaign against Kirkwood. To do this it had\r\nto change from republicanism to democracy, but it waged a hot fight,\r\nColonel Merritt being its editor. However, Kirkwood was elected and in\r\n1862 C. M. Hollis purchased the _Times_ and he made great success of it\r\nup to 1866 when he disposed of the paper to Ayers and McClelland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH, LISBON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN STREET, MT. VERNON]\r\n\r\nMuch might be written about some of the old printers who helped to\r\npublish those early Linn county newspapers. There has been a host of\r\nthem and they have included some notable men. One was no less a\r\npersonage than Mr. Rosewater, of the Omaha Bee, who once worked as a\r\njourneyman printer in the office of the _Slovan-Americky_. It was when\r\nhe was on his way to the west. Some of the old printers have long since\r\npassed away. One of the latest of them was Stephen M. Jones, who died\r\nat Hampton four years ago. Concerning his work here in Cedar Rapids,\r\nCaptain J. O. Stewart, himself one of the veteran printers of the\r\nstate, writes interestingly as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Stephen Jones commenced to learn the trade in the\r\n     _Progressive Era_ office in this city, in the year 1851,\r\n     serving a four years' apprenticeship, at the end of which\r\n     time he went to Vinton and worked in the _Eagle_ office, at\r\n     that time conducted by Fred Layman, I believe. The office of\r\n     the _Progressive Era_ was located on the corner of First\r\n     street and Third avenue, where the Warfield-Pratt-Howell\r\n     wholesale building now stands, and was the first paper\r\n     published in Cedar Rapids. It was an old frame building\r\n     erected by the Greene brothers and formerly used as a store\r\n     room. At the time of this story the lower floor front was\r\n     used on Sundays by the Episcopal church for service, the\r\n     printing office was overhead and the back part, three\r\n     stories, including basement, was used as a store room for\r\n     dressed hogs. 'Steve,' as he was called, and your\r\n     correspondent were what was known as 'printer's devils.'\r\n     After some years residence in Vinton Steve got about a\r\n     wheelbarrow load of material and started his paper in\r\n     Hampton and christened it the _Hampton Chronicle_, which is\r\n     still among the live, able newspapers in Iowa. He was later\r\n     appointed postmaster of Hampton, which position he held for\r\n     twelve years.\r\n\r\n     \"There is one other who would rank with us if he is still\r\n     living, and he was a few years ago, on his farm near Lone\r\n     Tree in Johnson county. His name is Dan Shaffer. Dan, with a\r\n     Mr. Foster, whose first name I have forgotten, were employed\r\n     in the office doing the work on the Iowa Supreme Court\r\n     Reports by Justice George Greene, formerly of this city.\r\n     This was a book of some 600 or more pages and an edition of\r\n     500 volumes. This book can be found on the shelves of many\r\n     of the Iowa lawyers, especially the older practitioners.\r\n     This work was all done on a Washington hand press and 500\r\n     impressions was considered a good day's work. Steve's\r\n     principal business, until he was relieved by the writer, was\r\n     to ink the forms from which the impressions were made. This\r\n     was done by passing over the type forms two large rollers\r\n     made of glue and molasses, leaving and returning onto a\r\n     large wooden roller revolved by a crank at one end, which\r\n     process equally distributed the ink which was applied to the\r\n     two rollers by a still smaller one and designated the\r\n     'brayer'--old printers will recognize the article. For\r\n     nearly two years this was the principal part of the writer's\r\n     duties, interspersed with hunting up and down the banks of\r\n     the river dragging out floating slabs that got away from the\r\n     saw mills up at the dam, for fuel for the office, the\r\n     proprietors being too poor to buy cordwood at $1.75 per\r\n     cord. The paper was published by Dan O. Finch who later\r\n     became distinguished as a lawyer of high ability. The last I\r\n     knew of him, a few years ago, he was still living, making\r\n     his home with a son some place on the Pacific\r\n     coast,--Seattle, I believe. The other publisher was William\r\n     Williams, son of Chief Justice Williams of this state. The\r\n     material was owned by the Greene brothers. Some time later\r\n     the _Era_ office was moved to the building that stood on the\r\n     corner where the Rudolph store now is. The proprietors\r\n     changed hands pretty often, and finally the paper came into\r\n     the hands of Robert and LeRoy McCabe, older brothers of the\r\n     famous Chaplain Charles C. McCabe, who then clerked for\r\n     Greene Bros. in their store under the printing office. The\r\n     Masonic lodge room was in the third story of this building.\r\n     While the McCabe brothers conducted the paper your\r\n     correspondent graduated and started out as a full fledged\r\n     journeyman printer. It may be of interest to the craft of\r\n     the day to give your correspondent's salary. The first year\r\n     he was to receive $35, second $50, third $75, and the fourth\r\n     the princely sum of $100. Out of this he was supposed to\r\n     pay his board and furnish his clothing. The first job he\r\n     secured after his apprenticeship was $10 per week and pay\r\n     his own board. This was in the year 1856.\r\n\r\n     \"The tramping jour. printers of those days, like Bret\r\n     Harte's Heathen Chinee, were peculiar. As a class they were\r\n     the best of workmen; bright and intelligent, knowing the\r\n     'art preservative' thoroughly, but possessed of that roving\r\n     disposition so common to all printers of that time, and many\r\n     of them given to drink. They would work for a time and get a\r\n     little ahead and then get on a 'toot' and seek newer fields.\r\n     They often resorted to peculiar methods to procure a job. I\r\n     recall an incident while I was yet the 'devil' of the _Era_\r\n     office. It was on the day we were moving the office to the\r\n     new quarters. The heavy press and material had to be skidded\r\n     from the second floor to the ground through a large door in\r\n     the front of the building. When the heavier part of the\r\n     press was partly down a rather tall, strong built,\r\n     intelligent looking man put in an appearance. He watched the\r\n     process for a short time not saying a word. Finally he took\r\n     from his pocket a slip of dirty paper and wrote on it 'don't\r\n     you need some help?' and handed it to the proprietor, Mr.\r\n     Robert McCabe. He was asked if he could talk. His reply was\r\n     simply by signs indicating that he was deaf and dumb. He\r\n     proved an excellent help and stayed for more than three\r\n     months, never indicating that he could speak. He was a\r\n     skilled printer, but cross and particular, and often we\r\n     'devils' called him hard names to his face. But his time had\r\n     come and he must have his periodical, and he did. He threw\r\n     his money to the kids on the streets and had a jolly time,\r\n     never once indicating he could speak. About the third day he\r\n     came into the office and took Mr. McCabe to the lodge room\r\n     above and wrote: 'What will they do to me if I talk?' Being\r\n     assured that he would not be harmed and to the astonishment\r\n     of the boss he reached out his hand and exclaimed, 'How are\r\n     you, Bob?' The same surprise was waiting for the rest of us,\r\n     and you may be assured we 'devils,' who had been giving him\r\n     such choice names, were looking for a chance to hide. He\r\n     soon left and I never heard of him again.\r\n\r\n     \"As I have said, the publishers changed often, and for some\r\n     time after the McCabe brothers left the paper it was hard to\r\n     tell just who did manage the paper, the Greenes owning the\r\n     material. After many vicissitudes, which all the papers of\r\n     that early day had to pass through, it fell into the hands\r\n     of Joseph Davenport, a practical printer who associated with\r\n     him James L. Enos, well known and well remembered by the\r\n     earlier settlers, who changed the name of the paper and\r\n     re-christened it the _Cedar Valley Times_. Later it was\r\n     changed to the _Cedar Rapids Times_, and was, after changing\r\n     hands many times, finally owned by Dr. McClelland and L. M.\r\n     Ayers, who published it for years, when it finally died of\r\n     old age, owned and published by Dr. McClelland. The old\r\n     _Progressive Era_ was the original progenitor of your\r\n     present _Daily Times_.\"\r\n\r\nFull of interest are those old files of the _Times_ which deal with the\r\nbeginning of the war period in the history of Linn county. There is the\r\ndescription of a \"democratic field day\" in Cedar Rapids, October 10,\r\n1860, when Stephen A. Douglas came over from Iowa City and spoke to the\r\nmultitude. Bands came from Vinton and Mt. Vernon; drum corps from\r\nBertram and Cedar Rapids. A local merchant bought a barrel of good\r\nwhiskey, diluted it sufficiently to accommodate the capacity of the six\r\nthousand who made up the audience, sold all of it and counted the\r\nmeeting as the best thing which ever had happened in Cedar Rapids.\r\nThere was a parade of the \"Wide-awakes\" that night, and the visiting\r\nbands remained over to furnish a part of the inspiration. There were\r\nbig posters, beginning with the couplet\r\n\r\n     \"O, dinna ye hear the slogan, boys?\r\n     'Tis Douglas and his men.\"\r\n\r\nThat gave the editor of the _Times_ an opportunity to write the first\r\nscare head which ever appeared in a Cedar Rapids newspaper. With the\r\ntrue newspaper instinct he remembered that slogan and used it for a\r\nsting at the end of the headline. This was the headline the week of the\r\nelection:\r\n\r\n     \"ELECTION OVER\r\n\r\n     ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS PRESIDENT-ELECT\r\n\r\n     Shout the Glad Tidings, Exultingly Sing; Old Abe is Elected\r\n     and Cotton Ain't King--Secession Rebuked--Popular\r\n     Sovereignty Now Here--Fusion Worse Confounded--The Bell\r\n     Tolling for the Dead--Union Preserved--Dinna Ye Hear the\r\n     Slogan.\"\r\n\r\nMr. C. M. Hollis, who was editor of the _Cedar Valley Times_ from 1862\r\nto 1866, gives an illuminating insight into the history of Linn county\r\nduring the early days of the war:\r\n\r\n     \"My office in Cedar Rapids was naturally the meeting place\r\n     of politicians. There the men who controlled or sought to\r\n     control got together and talked plainly. And the plain talk\r\n     of politicians is very different from the phrasings which\r\n     they use in public speeches. It was thus that our Linn\r\n     county leaders reasoned. 'This war is becoming something in\r\n     which the whole people have intense interest. They will\r\n     judge of men from the fact of participation or opposition.\r\n     When the struggle is over the men who control in politics\r\n     will be those who have been soldiers.' And so these men went\r\n     after commissions. They were wise and far-seeing and reaped\r\n     reward of their prudence as well as of their valor. I saw\r\n     the commission of one Linn county man made out for the\r\n     majoralty in an Iowa regiment, not only before the regiment\r\n     had been organized, but even before a single company had\r\n     been raised. I saw another for a colonelcy, fixed out ahead\r\n     in the same way, by reason of political grace and pull. Not\r\n     but what these men, and others, made good officers. I am\r\n     only explaining the reasoning which prompted some of them to\r\n     enter service, and the means which were most efficacious in\r\n     securing prominent places.\r\n\r\n     \"And after a time it was considered that to get a high\r\n     commission was tantamount to drawing a big political prize.\r\n     Men were thus rewarded for their assistance given to\r\n     successful candidates, and opponents found their way to army\r\n     prominence beset with many obstacles. You know that a\r\n     movement was started in Linn county to defeat Kirkwood for\r\n     governor for the second term. This developed considerable\r\n     strength, and a ticket was nominated with William H. Merritt\r\n     of Cedar Rapids at its head. Merritt had been\r\n     lieutenant-colonel of the First Iowa, and his was known as\r\n     the 'fusion' ticket. It was an attempt to combine 'war\r\n     democrats' and some elements of the republican party.\r\n     Kirkwood was successful, and those men who had sought his\r\n     defeat were, naturally, persona non grata with the state\r\n     government. When commissions were going they were not\r\n     remembered. Seymour D. Carpenter was one of these. But he\r\n     did finally become surgeon of a regiment, because there was\r\n     crying need for surgeons. Then when he was away from\r\n     gubernatorial influence promotion was rapid, and the doctor\r\n     was given a position as medical director of a department.\r\n     Ellsworth N. Bates was another who suffered because of\r\n     participation in the anti-Kirkwood movement. Mr. Bates\r\n     persisted, however, and his merits and standing could not be\r\n     ignored. He was elected captain of a company. With his\r\n     regiment he served with more than usual credit, until he\r\n     sickened and came home to die. There were others in Cedar\r\n     Rapids and in Linn county who had similar experiences. Some\r\n     of those who are still living, if they would but give full\r\n     statements, would verify my remark that the proportion of\r\n     politics mixed with the patriotism of those times was\r\n     greater than is generally known.\r\n\r\n     \"Speaking of Ellsworth N. Bates recalls to mind one whose\r\n     name deserves to be remembered in Cedar Rapids and in Linn\r\n     county. He came to the town fresh from college. He was a\r\n     real scholar and a man of rare natural abilities. He had the\r\n     art of making friends--of gaining and retaining esteem of\r\n     all who knew him. He was one of the very best public\r\n     speakers I have ever heard--quick to respond to varying\r\n     occasion, with ready thought and a phenomenal command of\r\n     language. His choice of words and use of appropriate imagery\r\n     made his addresses models of their kind. As a lawyer he met\r\n     with instant success. He represented Linn county in the\r\n     legislature, and was acknowledged as a strong man among the\r\n     law-makers. He made a splendid fight for the state\r\n     senatorship candidacy, against H. G. Angle. He was assistant\r\n     secretary of the second constitutional convention of Iowa.\r\n     When the war broke out he was one of those who did much to\r\n     rouse sentiment for support of the government. Then he\r\n     raised Company A of the Twentieth, and proved himself a real\r\n     soldier in camp and field. When he came home, near to death,\r\n     he had lost none of his old enthusiasm. He and I were\r\n     intimate friends, and to me he told his plans for the\r\n     future. Had E. N. Bates lived, I know that he would have\r\n     ranked among the real statesmen of Iowa. As it was he\r\n     accomplished more and had greater influence upon\r\n     contemporaneous affairs than many whose deeds are very\r\n     carefully preserved.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hollis also tells us how newspapers were made in that awful period\r\nof the nation's history:\r\n\r\n     \"We were not sensationalists in those days. The events that\r\n     we had to chronicle needed no trickery of headlines or large\r\n     type to command attention. Here are the lists of dead and\r\n     wounded in an Iowa regiment at the battle of Winchester,\"\r\n     and the old editor opened a file of the _Times_ for 1864-65.\r\n     \"Do you think it needed a flaming poster effect to secure\r\n     reading of that column? There are the names of friends and\r\n     neighbors. To some of the readers of that paper those names\r\n     represented their dearest ones. Those who had brothers or\r\n     fathers, or sons or sweethearts in that regiment read over\r\n     the battle lists with a fearful anxiety. We were giving\r\n     weekly chronicle of facts--they have not yet been arranged\r\n     into the order of definite history. When we wrote editorials\r\n     it was not pretended that we understood all there was to the\r\n     struggle. Only when and where we caught the partial views or\r\n     grasped the immediate meaning of some development we gave\r\n     our opinions. These may have been prejudiced by our personal\r\n     sentiments or our political affiliations, but I believe, as\r\n     a rule, the editorial utterances of those years were from\r\n     the souls of the writers and had the ring of sincerity. And,\r\n     with but few exceptions, the newspapers of Iowa were loyal.\r\n     They directed or seconded loyal sentiment on all occasions.\r\n     Few of the editors of those weeklies gained wealth or\r\n     distinction, but they deserve to be remembered for a\r\n     splendid work. They, too, are among 'the forgotten\r\n     worthies.' It cost money to run even a weekly paper during\r\n     the war years. When I began as publisher of the _Times_\r\n     print paper cost $6 a bundle; before the war was over I was\r\n     paying $16 for the same quality and amount. And wages ran up\r\n     and up, as printers were more difficult to secure; until I\r\n     was paying double what I had first found necessary.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war the newspapers of the county began to turn\r\ntheir attention to other evils. A wave of temperance sentiment swept\r\nthe county, and some of the editors were foremost among the fighters.\r\nThe county was aroused by the great amount of crime. Much of it\r\nemanated from Cedar Rapids. \"Can we expect,\" asked one writer in Cedar\r\nRapids, \"peace and quiet in a place of 3,000 inhabitants which supports\r\nnot fewer than nineteen liquor establishments and several houses of ill\r\nfame and does not support a single reading room nor a public library?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER LAURANCE Long Prominent in Cedar Rapids]\r\n\r\nThen, as now, the newspapers were the best \"boosters\" of their\r\nrespective communities. They were the first to point out the advantages\r\nin each community and to suggest ways in which natural advantages might\r\nlead to commercial growth and civic prosperity. Thus a writer in a\r\nCedar Rapids paper, after enumerating and commending the progress made\r\nby the town since its organization, dwelt upon the value of the water\r\npower, pointed out how the woolen mills then in operation might be made\r\nmore effective. There was an abundance of timber around Cedar Rapids at\r\nthat time and he advocated the establishment of saw mills in the city.\r\nHe saw no reason why staves should be brought all the way from Michigan\r\nto Cedar Rapids, when they might as well be manufactured here at home.\r\nHe advocated that a packing house be established in this city, instead\r\nof shipping the hogs from Cedar Rapids to Chicago and then shipping the\r\nmeat back. \"This is only one item that would keep thousands of dollars\r\nin our town that now go out,\" he argued. He wanted a hub and a spoke\r\nfactory, a fanning mill factory, and as for a \"paper mill there is no\r\nbetter point in the state.\"\r\n\r\nHistory moves in ever repeating cycles and some of the things for which\r\nthis old editor fought are still needed today in Cedar Rapids and in\r\nother towns of Linn county. But each cycle is better than the last.\r\nProof of this is seen in the dispute which was waged over freight rates\r\nless than a decade after the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railway had been\r\nbuilt into this city. The grain rates from Cedar Rapids to Chicago were\r\nthirty cents a hundred pounds and the noise of protest which was made\r\nthen was quite similar to the noise which is sometimes\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEWSPAPER GRAVEYARD\r\n\r\nThe newspaper graveyard was established very early in the history of\r\nthe county and it is still claiming its victims. Among its early\r\nvictims was the _Cedar Rapids Democrat_. It was issued by W. W. Perkins\r\n& Co. Somehow or other, democracy never flourished greatly in the Linn\r\ncounty newspaper field, and the early democratic editors had not\r\nlearned the art of switching to a \"progressive\" side. So their papers\r\ndied. The _Democrat_ lived a year and a half. It deserved a better\r\nfate, for it was well edited and printed.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 a monthly agricultural paper called the _Cedar Valley Farmer_\r\nwas commenced by James L. Enos. It lived through the first volume, but\r\na grave was opened for it before it had reached the tender age of two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe _Voice of Iowa_ was commenced in January, 1857, under the auspices\r\nof the Iowa Teachers and Phonetic associations, James L. Enos\r\neditor-in-chief, assisted by a board of corresponding editors. It was\r\ncontinued through two volumes and was then merged with another journal.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1864 A. G. Lucas & Co. commenced the publication of\r\nthe _Cedar Rapids Atlas_. In January, 1865, it was changed to a weekly.\r\nThen it was enlarged. Its place in the newspaper graveyard was prepared\r\na few weeks later. The editor and publisher had gone to study the\r\ngeography of other fields, but he did not take his debts with him. The\r\noffice was sold to satisfy them. This so weakened the shoulders of the\r\n_Atlas_ that it was not strong enough to hold up.\r\n\r\nThe _Western World_ was born into a cold and unresponsive world, and\r\nsoon it joined the ranks of the dear departed.\r\n\r\nThen came the _Linn County Signal_ which its authors hoped would be a\r\nsignal success. But its signals became tangled and it failed to kick\r\nover the goal of success. It kicked the bucket instead. T. G. Newman,\r\nthe father of A. H. Newman of the Cedar Rapids Candy Company, purchased\r\nthe remains. From them he made the office of the _Daily Observer_,\r\nwith J. L. Enos as editor. From the _Observer_ came the _Cedar Rapids\r\nRepublican_. This was in 1870. In 1902 there was re-born the _Cedar\r\nRapids Times_. The father _Republican_ and the strong and lusty son\r\n_Times_ are both in the full vigor of their powers, and this evolution\r\nof the two powerful dailies from the amoeba-like weakly _Signal_ is the\r\nmost conspicuous example of newspaper evolution and the survival of the\r\nfittest on record.\r\n\r\nThe present _Cedar Rapids Times_ is not to be confounded with the\r\n_Cedar Rapids Weekly Times_ which had such a long and prosperous growth\r\nunder the management of Editor Hollis, and later of the good Doctor\r\nMcClelland. The _Weekly Times_ lived until the death of Doctor\r\nMcClelland, and it was a power for good. Then came two gentlemen from\r\nMilwaukee who converted it into a daily. They had a great run as long\r\nas their cash and their credit held out. And they were good newspaper\r\nmen, too. But they drew nearer and nearer the gateway to the great and\r\nyawning newspaper graveyard. There were many mourners in Cedar Rapids\r\nwhen the _Times_ was buried. It had been purified before its death by\r\nits conspicuous work in a great tent revival conducted by an\r\nevangelist, M. B. Williams. This revival the other dailies refused even\r\nto mention. The _Times_ had a great deal of broadcloth endorsement. But\r\nthe eulogies proved to be its premature obituaries. Cash came slowly.\r\nAdvertising was coy. With the fall of the leaves came the death of the\r\n_Times_. The _Gazette_ bought up the household furnishings, the\r\nsubscription lists and the good will. But the _Times_ was buried, and\r\nthe ghost of competition which had haunted the _Gazette_ office was\r\nlaid until the owners of the present _Evening Times_ resurrected the\r\nname amid a riot of red ink during the strenuous municipal campaign of\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD HAD A LONG LIFE\r\n\r\nThe _Cedar Rapids Standard_, like the _Cedar Valley Times_, had a long\r\nlife. It was first established in Marion in 1868, as the _Linn County\r\nSignal_, by F. H. Williams. The following year it was removed to Cedar\r\nRapids, and Thomas G. Newman became the owner. In 1872 the name was\r\nchanged to the _Linn County Liberal_, and the office was moved back to\r\nMarion. In 1873 James T. Simpkins became editor. The following year the\r\nplant made a final trip to Cedar Rapids and was changed to the\r\n_Standard_. For a long time it flourished, having a number of owners\r\nand editors. Among them were Thomas G. Newman, C. E. Heath, A. H.\r\nNewman, D. H. Ogden, H. A. Cook, Frank L. Millar, and in June, 1880,\r\nCharles H. Playter, of the Des Moines _Daily Leader_, came to town and\r\nbought a half interest of Mr. Millar. The firm name became Millar &\r\nPlayter. This partnership continued until the fall of 1885, when Mr.\r\nPlayter bought out his partner and became the sole owner. In the fall\r\nof 1886 Mr. Playter sold the _Standard_ to S. B. Ayers, who conducted\r\nit through the triumphal period of Iowa democracy, when Horace Boies\r\nsat in the gubernatorial chair. It was a strong democratic paper and\r\nhad a large patronage in Linn county at that time. Later L. S. Saner\r\nbecame the editor. But the hard times came. Rightly or wrongly they\r\nwere blamed on the democratic party. Republicanism triumphed; McKinley\r\nwas elected. The _Standard_ of the democratic party was trailed in the\r\ndust. It soon died and took its place in the Cedar Rapids journalistic\r\ngraveyard.\r\n\r\nThe _Marion Pilot_ was established in 1871 at Mt. Vernon, as the _Linn\r\nCounty Pilot_, and C. W. Kepler was editor. In 1874 the office was\r\nremoved to Marion and the paper was owned by Beatty & Whittits. It\r\ncontinued under this management for several years and was one of the\r\nstrong republican papers of the county. In 1884 it was purchased by the\r\nRev. J. W. Chaffee and its name was changed to the _Marion Pilot_. He\r\nbuilt up a good paper, putting it in the front rank of the weekly\r\npapers of the state. But with his passing from the editorial chair and\r\nthe rapid rise of the daily press in Cedar Rapids and its rival county\r\nseat newspapers its power and prestige waned. In 1906 it yielded up\r\nthe ghost and was assigned to an honored place among those that have\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Good Ones Which Remain_\r\n\r\nTHE DAILY REPUBLICAN AND THE EVENING TIMES\r\n\r\nAs narrated above, the _Daily Republican_ is the outgrowth of the daily\r\n_Observer_. In 1872 the _Observer_ was transferred to the Republican\r\nPrinting Company, and the name, which at first was the _Cedar Rapids\r\nRepublican_, was changed to the _Daily Republican_, the present name of\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\nA daily and weekly issue was published and the paper grew rapidly. For\r\na time it was edited by William B. Leach. In 1877 it passed into the\r\nhands of the Republican Printing Company, who put in a great amount of\r\ncapital and enlarged the office. There were many editors during this\r\nperiod. In March, 1881, the office was leased to J. R. Sage and D. G.\r\nGoodrich, with an option of sale within a year. During this period the\r\npaper was changed from an evening to a morning issue and an Associated\r\nPress franchise was secured, giving the paper full news service.\r\n\r\nBefore the lease had expired Messrs. Sage and Goodrich had exercised\r\ntheir right to purchase the plant. On March 1, 1882, it was transferred\r\nto J. R. Sage, Johnson Brigham, Fred Benzinger, and H. P. Keyes. This\r\nquartette reorganized the old Republican Printing Company, with J. R.\r\nSage as president. Nearly two years later Mr. Sage transferred his\r\ninterest to Mr. Brigham, and later on Messrs. Keyes and Benzinger\r\ntransferred their interest to L. S. Merchant. Messrs. Brigham and\r\nMerchant conducted the paper, Mr. Merchant as business manager and Mr.\r\nBrigham as editor, until 1892, when Mr. Brigham sold his interest and\r\nwent to Des Moines to start the first Iowa literary magazine, the\r\n_Midland Monthly_. Mr. Sage had previously gone to Des Moines to become\r\nthe director of the Iowa weather and crop service.\r\n\r\nMr. Brigham's interest was purchased by Luther A. Brewer, who had been\r\nassistant business manager, W. R. Boyd, who had done some editorial\r\nwork for the paper while living at home in Cedar county, and by L. S.\r\nMerchant. The paper was at the beginning of what seemed to be an\r\nuninterrupted period of ownership and prosperity when death suddenly\r\nclaimed Mr. Merchant in 1894. Mrs. Merchant retained her husband's\r\ninterest and the paper went on as before and waged a fight against free\r\nsilver in the campaign of 1896 which made it nationally prominent. Mr.\r\nBrewer in the meantime had built up a very large job printing and book\r\nbinding department.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the entire plant was sold to H. G. McMillan, of Rock Rapids, at\r\nthat time United States district attorney, and Cyrenus Cole, who had\r\nfor many years been associate editor of the _Iowa State Register_. Mr.\r\nBoyd became postmaster at Cedar Rapids, but Mr. Brewer remained with\r\nthe paper as its business manager for some time. An evening edition,\r\nthe _Evening Times_, was started in 1902, and made a rapid growth. It\r\nnow has the largest circulation of any daily paper in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Mr. Brewer left the business and opened up a big book-making\r\nplant of his own known as The Torch Press. In July of the same year\r\nhowever, The Torch Press bought out the interest of Mr. McMillan and\r\nthe _Daily Republican_ and the _Evening Times_ have since been owned\r\nand published by Messrs. Brewer and Cole. The substantial building on\r\nSecond avenue which had been erected during the regime of Messrs.\r\nBrigham and Merchant proved far too small and the property was sold. A\r\nlarge and modern newspaper and book-making building, four stories high,\r\nwas erected at the corner of Fourth avenue and Third street, the\r\npresent home of the _Daily Republican_, the _Evening Times_, The Torch\r\nPress Printery and Bindery, and The Torch Press Book-shop, which\r\nlatter is managed by William Harvey Miner and is the biggest and most\r\nlargely patronized book shop west of Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVENING GAZETTE\r\n\r\nThere is not a great deal of \"history\" concerning the Cedar Rapids\r\n_Evening Gazette_, which has been one of the conspicuous successes\r\namong Iowa daily newspapers since it was started in 1883. On June 10 of\r\nthat year, the daily _Gazette_ was founded by Messrs. Otis and Post. A\r\nweekly issue of the paper was started at the same time. In March, 1884,\r\nthe Gazette Company was organized, and in July of that year the entire\r\nstock was purchased by Messrs. Fred W. Faulkes and Clarence L. Miller.\r\nThe paper has had the same ownership ever since that time. The late\r\neditor Faulkes was a pungent and versatile writer, and under his\r\neditorial management the _Gazette_ rapidly rose to a commanding\r\nposition in the Iowa newspaper field. It began as a republican\r\nnewspaper. But after the memorable Frank D. Jackson campaign in 1893\r\nEditor Faulkes became estranged from Governor Jackson and some of the\r\nother leaders of the republican party. Thereafter he was inclined to\r\nespouse the cause of democracy and the _Gazette_ came to be regarded as\r\nthe democratic newspaper of Linn county. Still later it grew more\r\nindependent, in matters of politics.\r\n\r\nSince the death of Fred Faulkes the _Gazette_ has been published under\r\nthe supervision of its business manager Clarence L. Miller. Like the\r\nother dailies of the city it has abandoned the weekly field.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SATURDAY RECORD\r\n\r\nThe _Saturday Record_ is the outgrowth of a little amateur paper\r\nstarted away back in 1879 by Ralph Van Vechten, at present\r\nvice-president of the Continental and Commercial National Bank of\r\nChicago. He was then a student with a taste for printer's ink and he\r\nstarted a little literary paper, known as the _Stylus_. Soon after that\r\nhe was joined by Arthur J. Huss, and the two of them ran the _Stylus_.\r\nIn the spring of 1882 Mr. Van Vechten went into his uncle's bank. The\r\npaper passed into the hands of A. J. Mallahan, and after a little time\r\nwas temporarily discontinued. But Mr. Huss gained new courage and\r\nperhaps new capital. September 10, 1882, he started the _Cedar Rapids\r\nPeople_. It continued as a seven column folio until March, 1884, when\r\nit was bought by Fred Benzinger and R. Baer and its name changed to the\r\n_Saturday Evening Chat_. July 1, 1887, Fred Benzinger bought out Mr.\r\nBaer's interest and ran the paper for a number of years until he went\r\nto Chicago, where for a time he was one of the prominent figures on the\r\nold Chicago _Times-Herald_. Then the paper was acquired by B. R.\r\nHatmaker, forever famous because of the sobriquet for Cedar Rapids\r\nwhich flashed into his mind one dreamful day--\"The Parlor City.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Ernest A. Sherman came to this city and was city editor of the\r\nmorning _Republican_ for a while. In February. 1891, he started _Town\r\nTopics_. He ran it until late in the spring of that year and then he\r\nconsolidated with Hatmaker's _Saturday Record_. He became the editor,\r\nand Hatmaker was business manager until 1892 when Mr. Sherman bought\r\nthe whole business. Since that time the _Record_ has been a permanent\r\nfeature in Cedar Rapids, the largest and neatest of the weeklies, being\r\nprinted in quarto form on book paper with many illustrations and spicy\r\ncomment on \"mentionable matters\" of Cedar Rapids, with all the local\r\nnews well edited.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IOWA POST\r\n\r\nThe _Iowa Post_ was founded in April, 1881, at Iowa City. After passing\r\nthrough the hands of several owners, it was purchased in March, 1902,\r\nby Henry Gundling of Chicago and brought to this city. Mr. Gundling\r\nchanged the paper from a weekly to a semi-weekly and in an incredibly\r\nshort time he had trebled the number of his subscribers. Mr. Gundling\r\nhad a high school education in Germany, followed by an apprenticeship\r\nthere of three years. He had sixteen years experience in Chicago and he\r\nhas travelled extensively on three continents. He is, therefore,\r\nthoroughly equipped as an editor and this accounts for the high\r\nstandard of his paper which is eagerly read by a very large\r\nconstituency in this and adjoining counties and especially at the\r\ncolony of Amana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD M. E. CHURCH, MT. VERNON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET SCENE IN LISBON]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEST SIDE ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\nThe _West Side Enterprise_ is one of the latest newspapers in the Linn\r\ncounty field, having been started December 30, 1909. But it is one of\r\nthe liveliest as well as one of the latest. W. I. Endicott is the owner\r\nand publisher, and he is a whole newspaper force in himself. Every\r\nissue of the _Enterprise_ contains something which makes somebody sit\r\nup and take notice. It is a paper devoted to the work of booming the\r\nwest side; but it is read on both sides of the river by an ever\r\nincreasing number of readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIOWA STAATS-ZEITUNG\r\n\r\nThe _Iowa Staats-Zeitung_ was established in the year 1879 by A. Hunt,\r\nwho continued as publisher and editor for many years--until he retired\r\nfrom the newspaper business. The paper was then bought by John Young\r\nand afterwards sold to the Charles Stoudt Printing Company, who came\r\nfrom Des Moines to Cedar Rapids to make their home. The company\r\nconsists of Charles Stoudt, the publisher, and E. J. Stoudt, editor.\r\nThe paper is one of the largest German weeklies in the state,\r\npublishing from twelve to twenty-four pages each issue and going all\r\nover the state. It guarantees to have the largest circulation of any\r\nGerman paper published in Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER CEDAR RAPIDS PAPERS\r\n\r\nSeveral other Cedar Rapids newspapers ought to be mentioned. The _Cedar\r\nRapids Listy_, a Bohemian humorous paper, was established in 1906. Fr.\r\nHradecky is its editor and publisher. The _Optimus_ is a republican\r\nweekly edited by E. C. Barber, and is a most uncompromising foe of\r\ndemocracy in all its form. It was established in 1906. The\r\n_Slovan-Ameriky_ is a democratic Bohemian paper, one of the oldest, for\r\nit was established in 1869 and has held the even tenor of its way since\r\nthat time through the sunshine and storm of democracy. John B. Letovsky\r\n& Sons are the editors and publishers, and they have been putting out a\r\ngood paper week in and week out, year after year.\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ is the organ of the Federation of Labor in Cedar Rapids.\r\nIt was started in 1903 and has had a remarkable success. Its first\r\neditor was G. F. Taylor who gave the paper a great start and it is now\r\nedited by R. G. Stewart, who fills its columns full of gingery stuff\r\nweek after week and shines best when there is a big political scrap on\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARION REGISTER\r\n\r\nIn 1852 one A. Hoyt came all the way from New York to blaze the way of\r\nmodern journalism on the prairies of Iowa. He established a paper\r\ncalled the _Prairie Star_. But the _Star_ didn't shine long. Mr. Hoyt\r\nfound Iowa so different from old New York. Like the wise men of the\r\neast, after he had let go of most of the treasures he brought with him\r\nhe retraced his steps to the east and the paper passed into the hands\r\nof J. H. and G. H. Jennison. They were Whigs with a big W and they\r\nrenamed the _Star_ as the _Linn County Register_.\r\n\r\nWhen the republican party was organized, the _Linn County Register_\r\nbecame one of its most able and enthusiastic advocates in the county.\r\nThe late Judge N. M. Hubbard was in active politics at that time and\r\nduring that memorable campaign he conducted the _Register_. Ah, \"thim\r\nwere the days.\" The judge was a past master in the art of \"skinning\" an\r\nopponent. That was the method of political fighting in those days and\r\nno editor ever had a sharper knife than Judge Hubbard. He used to say\r\nin later years that it was one of the most enjoyable periods of his\r\nwhole life.\r\n\r\n\"I made the paper grow,\" he said. \"Everybody wanted to get it to see\r\nwhose hide was put on the fence that week.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge lived to tell the tale, but after the fun was all over and\r\nthe battle had been won he decided that railroad law practice was more\r\nprofitable than editing a newspaper. The _Register_ passed back into\r\nthe editorship of J. H. Jennison. The next year Robert Holmes became\r\nits editor and subsequently its proprietor. He held this position for\r\nfive years and it was five years of the most important period in the\r\nhistory of the county. Mr. Holmes successfully conducted the paper\r\nthrough the great struggle of the Civil war, and up till 1863 when he\r\nsold it to A. G. Lucas. Its name was then changed to the _Linn County\r\nPatriot_.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1864, there came from Cedar county, a young\r\nsoldier-lawyer, S. W. Rathbun. He purchased the plant and changed the\r\nname of the paper to the _Marion Register_. He has been editor of the\r\n_Register_ ever since that time. He has a few more gray hairs, a few\r\nmore wrinkles, and a bit more avoirdupois than he had then, but he\r\nstill wields a trenchant pen, still makes the _Register_ a readable and\r\ninteresting paper. It has been one of the most influential papers among\r\nthe weekly press of Linn county, and has always been firmly republican.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARION SENTINEL\r\n\r\nThe _Marion Sentinel_ was originally called the _Springville\r\nIndependent_, being established at Springville in the year 1879 by Fred\r\nChamberlain, who afterwards served as county superintendent of the\r\nschools of Linn county. It was a seven-column folio, independent in\r\npolitics, the forerunner of the independent papers of the county. It\r\ngrew rapidly, and by 1884 had increased to a twelve-page paper. An\r\nedition was also published for Prairieburg, and one for Central City.\r\nIn 1885 it had a circulation of 1600. It met with some reverses in 1886\r\nand on July 1 of that year it was moved to Marion and its name changed\r\nto the _Linn County Independent_. Mr. Chamberlain made a big success of\r\nit in Marion. The name of the paper was then changed to the _Marion\r\nSentinel_. Later O. M. Smith was taken into partnership. The paper then\r\nchanged from an independent to a democratic paper, and has remained\r\ndemocratic until the present time, the only simon pure democratic paper\r\nin Linn county at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1891, Mr. Smith sold the paper to Mr. J. J. Galliven, at that\r\ntime employed as train dispatcher for the Milwaukee railroad. He\r\nconducted it for less than three months, selling it on September 19,\r\n1891, to its present owner, T. T. Williams. During the greater part of\r\nthe time since then C. S. Shanklin, one of the ablest political writers\r\nof the state, has been in charge of the _Sentinel's_ editorial page.\r\nThe paper is one of the brightest and newsiest in the county.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MT. VERNON HAWKEYE\r\n\r\nThat splendid Linn county paper, the _Mt. Vernon Hawkeye_, was\r\nestablished January 1, 1869, by J. T. Rice, as the _Linn County\r\nHawk-Eye_. Mr. Rice was well known in the early history of the county,\r\nand in late years was a resident of Denver, Colorado, where he died\r\nwithin the past year.\r\n\r\nThe _Hawk-Eye_ was bought by S. H. Bauman on June 1, 1869, within five\r\nmonths after the paper was established, and its name was changed to the\r\n_Mount Vernon Hawk-Eye_. Mr. S. H. Bauman continued the business and\r\nwas joined in partnership by his son, A. A. Bauman, January 1, 1892. On\r\nJuly 1, 1899, S. H. Bauman retired entirely, and the paper was then\r\nconducted by his sons, A. A. and Fred A. Bauman. This partnership was\r\ndissolved November 17, 1909, since which time the paper has been\r\npublished by A. A. Bauman.\r\n\r\nThe paper has always been republican in politics and has never been\r\nshaken by the winds of temporary popular prejudice or passion. It has\r\nhad an abiding conviction of political honesty and integrity and it has\r\nbeen conducted on a high plane. It has rendered good service in the\r\nbuilding up of Mt. Vernon and the county generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WALKER NEWS\r\n\r\nThe _Walker News_ was established as a seven-column folio in February,\r\n1883, by David Brant, at present the owner and editor of the Iowa City\r\n_Daily Republican_. He continued as owner and editor for seven years,\r\nand then the paper passed to the hands of Charles A. Durno, Mr. Brant\r\ngoing to Cedar Rapids to become city editor of the _Gazette_.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1891, Mr. Durno sold a half interest in the business to C. O.\r\nand J. Barry, who, in January, 1892, acquired the remaining half\r\ninterest, Mr. Durno retiring. Mr. Durno was later appointed to a\r\nposition in the government printing office at Washington, D. C, and\r\ndied in that city a few years ago. The Barrys are still in possession\r\nof the _News_, which is one of the brightest and most influential\r\nnewspapers in the county.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTER POINT JOURNAL\r\n\r\nThe _Center Point Journal_ is a republican weekly, owned and edited by\r\nJ. A. Mahuran, one of the ablest of the Linn county newspaper men. The\r\npaper has had its ups and downs and for a time it was chiefly noted for\r\nits ardent campaign for a fishway in the dam across the Cedar river at\r\nCedar Rapids. That was during the days of Editor Barber.\r\n\r\nThe Journal grew out of the _Lotus_ which was started at Center Point,\r\nMay 15, 1873, by J. F. Wilson & Co. T. J. Metcalf was its first editor,\r\nand he filled the leaves of the _Lotus_ with spice and sweetness until\r\n1874 when W. T. Baker took charge and subsequently committed suicide.\r\nBut that was not the fault of the _Lotus_. The office was then sold to\r\nH. A. Cook, of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 T. J. Metcalf and S. M. Dunlap purchased the plant and changed\r\nthe name of the paper to the _Center Point Mirror_, the first issue\r\nappearing November 18. Then Mr. Metcalf bought out Mr. Dunlap's\r\ninterest, and afterwards G. L. Wilson became the owner, changing its\r\nname to the _Courier-Journal_. M. A. Oxley and Charles F. Floyd\r\nafterwards bought the paper and it finally reached the hands of its\r\npresent owner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPRINGVILLE NEW ERA\r\n\r\nSpringville is one of the best of the Linn county towns and it has one\r\nof the best of the Linn county papers, the Springville _New Era_. Its\r\nfirst issue appeared August 9, 1882. It was a six-column folio,\r\nindependent in politics, and was established by J. B. F. Butler. In\r\nNovember, 1882, C. S. Shanklin became its editor. At this time it was\r\nchanged to a six-column quarto. It became a democratic paper but lately\r\ngrew towards independence in politics, a growing tendency among modern\r\nnewspapers. There were some more changes of ownership and finally the\r\npaper was purchased by O. E. Crane, its present publisher and editor,\r\nunder whom it has risen to a popularity and prosperity never before\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LISBON HERALD\r\n\r\nLisbon has one good weekly, the _Herald_. The _Sun_ was the first paper\r\nhaving been started August 27, 1874, by J. W. Zeigenfus. It was not a\r\nsuccess at the start, or at least it did not bring in the coin of the\r\nrealm rapidly enough to suit its proprietor, and he soon sold it to C.\r\nJ. Weatherbee. He held it for a few weeks and sold it to W. T. Baker.\r\nBaker managed it admirably for a time but he later shot himself through\r\nthe head in his office and for a time the paper was conducted by W. L.\r\nDavis for his widow. Then the Rev. Dewalt S. Fouse became its editor\r\nand did some good work upon it. So did A. M. Floyd, one of the best of\r\nLinn county's newspaper men. But finally the _Sun_ went down.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald_ has been vigorous and active and prosperous since it was\r\nestablished in 1894 and it was never so prosperous as now. Under the\r\nable management of Will F. Stahl the paper has grown in size and in\r\ncirculation and every issue is filled with up-to-date news and\r\ninteresting comment. It is a paper of which Lisbon should be proud.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL CITY NEWS-LETTER\r\n\r\nSituated in a valley of entrancing beauty, the valley of the Wapsie\r\nriver, Central City is one of the most beautiful towns in Iowa and it\r\ncertainly is one of the most up-to-date. Much of its growth and its\r\nprestige is due to the fact that for many years it has had a\r\nfirst-class newspaper. The _Central City News-Letter_, which was\r\nstarted in 1888, has had a line of able men as its editors and they\r\nhave all done their best to make the city grow. None of them ever\r\nworked harder at it than E. S. Weatherbee, who is the owner and the\r\neditor of the paper, the postmaster, the mayor, and an all-around\r\nbooster for his town.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COGGON MONITOR\r\n\r\nSince 1889 Coggon has had a newspaper, the _Coggon Monitor_. It has had\r\na number of owners, but it is established on a firm basis. Clarence\r\nCole was the editor until April of this year, when he sold the paper to\r\nWilliam Crosier.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MT. VERNON RECORD\r\n\r\nIn 1893, the _Mount Vernon Record_ was established and it has had a\r\nsuccessful and gratifying growth under the management of Lloyd\r\nMcCutcheon, its publisher and editor. Advertising came slowly at\r\nfirst, as it always does to a new paper, but at present the merchants\r\nof Mt. Vernon are giving it good support. The paper has been\r\n\"progressive\"--strongly progressive in its editorial policies and\r\nthere are many progressives in that neighborhood who have backed it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOL, FAIRFAX]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHODIST CHURCH AND PARSONAGE, FAIRFAX]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_The Bohemian Element in the County_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this history to note in especial manner all\r\nthe different nationalities that have entered into the making of our\r\ncosmopolitan population. America is peopled by sturdy men and women who\r\nhave come to this land of opportunity and freedom from all the\r\ncivilized nations of the world. It is the amalgamation of these\r\ndifferent races and peoples that has done much to give us our sturdy\r\ncitizenship. Driven from their old homes by persecutions or the desire\r\nto better their condition, they have come to America and have helped\r\npopulate our prairies and develope our cities. They have needed the\r\nopportunities here given them, and we have needed them in our work of\r\nerecting on this continent a nation that shall be an example to all the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest and most important element of foreign extraction\r\nrepresented in Linn county is the Bohemian. Some of our townships are\r\nalmost entirely populated by these progressive immigrants and their\r\ndescendants, and a goodly percentage of the residents of Cedar Rapids\r\ntrace back their Slav ancestry to old Bohemia. These people have always\r\nmade good citizens. They possess the desirable faculty of adapting\r\nthemselves readily to new environments. Without destroying their own\r\nvigorous vitality, they grasp quickly the best there is in our thought\r\nand mode of life. They have borne nobly their share of the burdens\r\nincident to the establishment of new centers of civilization and of\r\nprogress. They have acted their part in our civic life. They have\r\nadapted themselves to and have adopted our institutions. They have\r\nhelped and are helping to make the county and the city centers of\r\ngrowth and prosperity. Trained through the years in habits of economy,\r\nand forced through necessity to keep up these habits, their life here\r\nhas often been an incentive to others to go and do likewise. Lovers of\r\nthe home, their ambition is to possess their own abiding place, and\r\nthat as quickly as possible. The Bohemians are not renters. They are a\r\nclass of home owners, and nothing is so potent for stability in any\r\ncommunity as this trait on the part of its people. They are indeed a\r\nthrifty people, such as every state and county and city gladly welcome.\r\nTheir buildings, though many of them may be small, are substantial in\r\ntheir character. The gardens and the grounds surrounding the dwellings\r\nin the towns and cities are neatly kept and attractive to the eye.\r\nTheir farms are well tilled and as a result grow rapidly in\r\nproductiveness and value.\r\n\r\nOur Bohemian citizens bear their part in the administration of public\r\naffairs. And they always make good in the positions in which they are\r\nplaced. They have helped make our city councils; they have been men of\r\nability and of influence on our school boards. They are numbered among\r\nour successful merchants and bankers. Indeed, there is scarce a line of\r\nhuman endeavor in which they have not been represented by men of\r\ncapacity and of worth.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the editors of this history Joseph Mekota, himself a\r\nsplendid representative of a splendid people, contributes the following\r\nsketch of the Bohemian people to this volume:\r\n\r\nThe history of the Bohemian people in Linn county does not differ\r\ngreatly from the general history of this people in our country. Driven\r\nfrom their native land, on account of political persecution and\r\nofficial oppression, they sought America as the haven of liberty and\r\nopportunity. They brought with them an abundance of patience, industry,\r\nperseverance, and hope. Their beginning was full of hardships,\r\nprivations, and obstacles. Their chief capital was their health and\r\nwillingness to toil, and their ability to stand hardship. These were\r\ntheir native heritage. Coming to this country poor, unacquainted with\r\nits customs, its language, and its laws, their beginning had but few\r\nsilver linings.\r\n\r\nDespite these inauspicious surroundings these early pioneers were\r\ncontented and happy. Physical and material hardships and trials were\r\ncheerfully borne for the joys and sweetness of political and religious\r\nliberty. Under the broad and clear skies of the religious, political,\r\nand intellectual tolerance of America they felt the realization of the\r\nunfulfilled dreams of the glorious but unsuccessful struggles of their\r\nancestors a century ago. Such a fine spirit towards the highest ideals\r\nin life and civilization, combined with inexhaustible energy and\r\npatience in industrial pursuits, has made this people loyal to our\r\ninstitutions and useful to the development and progress of our country.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers came to this county with teams and wagons. At that\r\ntime there were no railroads west of the Mississippi river. Many of\r\nthem came from Caledonia, Wisconsin, with ox teams. Others came by\r\nrailroad as far as the Mississippi river. One member of a family who\r\ncame here in 1855 said: \"They dumped us out at Muscatine and from there\r\nwe hired teams and conveyances to take us to Cedar Rapids. We moved\r\nsouth of the city and lived under a tree that summer. When we wanted to\r\nbuy anything we took a sample of the article in one hand and the amount\r\nof money we wished to expend in the other and would show that to our\r\nneighbors and make them understand what we wanted.\"\r\n\r\nThese early settlers devoted themselves to agricultural pursuits. Most\r\nof them located on or near timber lands so that they would have plenty\r\nof fuel. Fuel was very scarce in their native land, and it was easier\r\nto build their sheds if they were in the timber. The prairies at that\r\ntime were not desirable for location. A large portion of College\r\ntownship, which is now the best farming country in the state of Iowa,\r\nat that time was full of marshes, and high grass, and strong winds\r\nprevailed so that the early settlers avoided the prairies and located\r\nin timber districts.\r\n\r\nThe early Bohemian settlers came to Linn county about the years 1852\r\nand 1853. So far as known, the following families were among the early\r\npioneers: The Ligr family about the year 1852 settled east of Ely. John\r\nPosler, in the year 1853, also located about eight miles southeast of\r\nthe city. In 1854 or earlier, Paul Korab and his family settled about\r\none mile east of the present town of Western, where also settled at\r\nthat time John Witousek. The Korab family came here with an ox team\r\nfrom the state of Wisconsin by way of Dubuque. That year, 1854, Jacob\r\nPolak located about ten miles southeast of Cedar Rapids, and with him\r\nwas Joseph Sosel. These families also came with teams from the state of\r\nWisconsin. Anton Sulek located in the north part of Johnson county in\r\n1854, and he afterwards lived near Hoosier Grove in this county on a\r\nbeautiful, elevated spot called \"Hradek,\" and meaning \"Little Castle.\"\r\nMany other families came in 1855 and settled along the border line\r\nbetween Johnson and Linn counties, in College and Putnam townships. The\r\nnumbers that came were not great, and it was not until after the Civil\r\nwar that large numbers of these people came to this county.\r\n\r\nAmong these people Joseph Sosel was a character of distinction. His\r\nscholarly attainments combined with his love of intellectual and\r\npolitical freedom easily made him the leader among his people. He was a\r\npolitical exile. He took an active part in the uprising of Bohemian\r\nstudents in the year 1848. This movement was for more political rights\r\nand broader freedom for the people in Bohemia. The uprising did not\r\nmeet with success, and for his patriotic activity a price was set upon\r\nhis head by the Austrian government. With many other students, who\r\nwere in the same predicament, he escaped to this country. With him came\r\nKarel Jonas, who afterwards became lieutenant-governor of the state of\r\nWisconsin; and with them also came Vojtech Naprstek, who left a name in\r\nBohemian history that is known to every Bohemian.\r\n\r\nIn this locality Mr. Sosel rendered many valuable services to his\r\ncountrymen; being able to talk the English language, he became their\r\nlegal and business adviser. He was loyal to his countrymen, and at all\r\ntimes insisted that they should learn and observe the customs of their\r\nnew country. He served faithfully the interests of his people, and his\r\nmemory will forever be kindly remembered by them for the many and\r\nuseful services which he faithfully rendered.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Civil war, the Bohemian immigration was slow, but\r\nfrom those that were here quite a number enlisted from this county to\r\npreserve the integrity of their new country. Among those known who\r\nenlisted were the following: J. F. Bednar, Frank Renchin, Frank\r\nPeremsky, Joseph Wencel, Joseph Podhajsky, John Maly, Joseph Zahradnik,\r\nCharles Bednar, Joseph Horak, Wesley Horak, Frank Dolezal, Joseph\r\nDolezal.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil war Cedar Rapids became a prominent center of Bohemian\r\npopulation. Many came direct from their own country, others came from\r\nneighboring states, and still others came from the surrounding country\r\nin this state. So that at all times this city always had a large\r\npercentage of people of Bohemian origin, larger than any other city of\r\nits size in the state of Iowa. In the county they settled in Putnam,\r\nCollege and Franklin townships. From the year 1866, after the Prussian\r\nwar in Austria, to 1880 were perhaps the banner years of Bohemian\r\nemigration to this country. These people all located in the city or\r\nsoutheast of the city. There are today in Cedar Rapids about 8,500\r\ninhabitants of this nationality and about 2,500 more in other parts of\r\nthe county. They are now scattered all over the county, but large and\r\nheavy settlements are in Putnam and College townships, these being\r\nalmost exclusively settled by Bohemians. There is a large settlement in\r\nFairfax township, and there are settlements in Franklin, Bertram,\r\nBoulder, and Grant townships.\r\n\r\nIn agriculture they are successful farmers. No better improved farms,\r\nno better buildings, no better systems of farming exist in any other\r\npart of the state than in the communities settled by these people. They\r\nare progressive and up to date in all matters. They are hard working\r\npeople and devoted to the interests of their farms.\r\n\r\nIn Cedar Rapids they have also played an important part. A large\r\nmajority came to this country very lightly endowed with worldly goods,\r\nbut they were strong in health and body and not afraid to work. A very\r\nlarge percentage of these people belong to the laboring class. The\r\nwomen in the families worked as hard, if not harder, than the men. The\r\nfirst ambition of these people after their arrival in this country was\r\nto own a home. The father would work, the mother would work, and the\r\nchildren would work in order to buy and pay for a home. A great many of\r\nthem bought vacant lots and improved them by erecting neat and\r\ncomfortable dwellings. At times it was claimed they took their children\r\nout of school too early in order that they might work. In the early\r\ntimes there existed circumstances which could not very well avoid this\r\nsituation. The wages were low; families as a rule were large and in\r\norder to pay for a home and in order that the debts be paid, and to\r\nmeet expenses, it was necessary in many cases to press the children\r\ninto service. This custom became somewhat contagious among the men,\r\nwomen, and children. One family was bound to earn and make as much\r\nmoney as its neighbors, and therefore had to have as many members of\r\nthe family working. It is a source of congratulation that this custom,\r\nwhich had been one of necessity, is now losing ground among the ranks\r\nof this nationality and their children are kept in school as long as\r\nany children among other American people.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian people from the very first held tenaciously to their\r\nmother tongue. While they were loyal to our public schools and other\r\ninstitutions, they took steps to preserve and cultivate the mother\r\ntongue among themselves and their children. As early as 1868 a society\r\ncalled the \"Reading Society\" was organized. The purpose of this society\r\nwas to cultivate the Bohemian language; give aid to Bohemian schools;\r\nfurnish the best books of Bohemian literature to the people of our\r\ncity, and in every way possible to promote and awaken the love for\r\nBohemian language and history among the people. It was a center of\r\nnational life and spirit. In this laudable purpose the Reading Society\r\nof Cedar Rapids has met with unparalleled success.\r\n\r\nThe society today owns a fine library of nearly 3,000 volumes of the\r\nbest works of history, art, and literature in the Bohemian tongue.\r\nBesides this, the Reading Society has always been helpful, and largely\r\ninstrumental in starting, promoting, and encouraging other\r\norganizations of national character.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian people are fond of the theatre and theatrical\r\nperformances. At about the time that the Reading Society was organized,\r\nthey started an association for the purpose of giving theatrical\r\nperformances in the Bohemian tongue. The plays given were popular and\r\nsuccessful, and on many occasions there was displayed splendid\r\nhistrionic talent among the members of this dramatic club. Their\r\nperformances were always clean, instructive, and educational. Today we\r\nhave in Cedar Rapids two large dramatic associations whose performances\r\nare a credit to our city and its people.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of education, the Bohemian people always took an active\r\npart. Besides having their children attend the public schools, they\r\ntook opportunity to have them taught in the Bohemian language during\r\ntheir vacations and sometimes on Sundays. This was so from their\r\nearliest settlement. At first one or two rooms in a public school\r\nbuilding were used. Later on a building costing over $8000.00 was\r\nerected for this purpose. The building stands on the corner of Second\r\nstreet and Tenth avenue. This building has the honored distinction of\r\nbeing the only building in our whole country built and used exclusively\r\nas a Bohemian school.\r\n\r\nAnother institution that has brought fame and favor to our city in\r\neducational circles, is the Council of Higher Education. This was\r\nfounded here in 1902. It is an organization whose object it is to\r\nfurnish honor loans without interest to poor but promising boys and\r\ngirls of Bohemian origin to secure a college education. Since its\r\norganization this institution has aided many young men and women who\r\nwere without sufficient means to secure a college education. Last year\r\nit had sixteen students it was aiding in the various state universities\r\nand colleges. Its operation is nation wide. It has students in New\r\nYork, Michigan, Illinois, Texas, Nebraska, and Iowa. The funds of the\r\ninstitution are gathered by popular subscriptions among individuals and\r\nsocieties. Its scope covers every state in the Union where there is a\r\nBohemian settlement. The institution has achieved wonders in\r\nencouraging young men and women of Bohemian nationality to attend\r\nuniversities and colleges.\r\n\r\nIn musical circles the Bohemian people have distinguished themselves\r\nfrom early times. In the beginning when the Bohemian settlers came to\r\nthis city they organized a musical society. This formed a nucleus for\r\none of the most famous musical bands in the state. Kouba's National\r\nBand achieved state wide reputation; this band has always been composed\r\nof a large percentage of Bohemian musicians.\r\n\r\nIn the material development of Cedar Rapids the Bohemian people have\r\ndone their full share. In the ranks of labor they are known as honest,\r\nindustrious, peaceable, and orderly. They are very largely employed in\r\nall the big industrial institutions of our city. They command the\r\nconfidence and respect of their employers. This nationality is also\r\nwell represented in every line of business in our city. All the\r\nprofessions are represented. When we consider that less than two\r\ngenerations ago their ancestors came here with bare hands and not\r\nknowing the English language and unacquainted with the customs and\r\nwithout any particular advantages, except those of honesty and\r\nwillingness to work, it is remarkable that such strides forward have\r\nbeen made by this nationality in the realms of labor, business, and the\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAPEL, CORNELL COLLEGE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARNEGIE LIBRARY AND SPEER MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN, MT.\r\nVERNON]\r\n\r\nIn religious work the Bohemian people of Linn county have accomplished\r\nsplendid results. With the first settlers in this county, the Catholics\r\nof this city had a place of worship. From its modest beginning there\r\ngrew one of the largest congregations in the city. And what\r\nenthusiastic and untiring workers this church has! The congregation\r\nconsists very largely of the laboring class, but they have accomplished\r\nwonderful results. A splendid church building; a large parochial\r\nschool; an assembly hall and a new parsonage are the reward of the\r\npatience and perseverance among the members of this congregation. St.\r\nWenceslaus church of Cedar Rapids with its manifold work and influence\r\nis a great honor to the people of Linn county.\r\n\r\nWay back in the late sixties, on a beautiful and secluded spot on\r\nHoosier Creek, about one-half the distance between the present site of\r\nEly and Western, there was erected a small church of the Reformed\r\nEvangelical denomination. There a band of devout men and women met to\r\nworship in the simple manner of the Moravian brothers. Their leader and\r\nminister was a man of grace, of purity of character and rare and\r\nscholarly attainments. His name was Frank Kun. He was a great preacher\r\nand a great teacher. For a time he held the chair of Greek and Latin at\r\nWestern College, but as his congregation increased he devoted all his\r\ntime to his people. His congregation was entirely of the rural class.\r\nHe loved his people and in turn was loved by them. His congregation was\r\none of the best Bohemian congregations in the United States; his\r\nsermons were masterpieces of art and beauty, full of religious fervor,\r\nstately dignity and depth. His memory will forever be revered by the\r\npeople of Linn county. This church is still there; broadening its\r\nsphere of work it now has two branches, one in Johnson county, and one\r\nin Linn county, the last being the old Baptist church in Putnam\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\nIn Cedar Rapids the Bohemian people have three protestant churches: the\r\nFourth Presbyterian, the Bohemian Methodist, and the Reformed church;\r\nall three are prosperous. All of them have large and substantial\r\nmemberships and all of them are fortunate in having strong, capable,\r\nand popular men as ministers. Under the wise and liberal policies of\r\nthese leaders these churches are doing excellent work among the\r\nBohemian people.\r\n\r\nThere is a large, respectable element of the Bohemian population that\r\ndoes not belong to any church organization. They are not opposed to\r\nchurches, nor to religion, but do not affiliate with any church\r\norganization. They believe that every one should be permitted to think\r\nand believe as he pleases in matters of faith. In the Bohemian language\r\nthey are called \"Svobodamysli.\" This word does not mean Free Thinkers.\r\n\"This Bohemian word is made up of two words 'Liberty' and 'Mind,' and\r\nit means the broadest toleration for the religious beliefs and opinions\r\nof others; and further it means that you should give the widest\r\nlatitude to the religious beliefs and forms of worship of your\r\nneighbors, and that they should do the same to you; and it further\r\nmeans that you should honor and respect the religious views and\r\nprofessions of your neighbors and they should do the same by you.\"\r\n\r\nNo sketch of the Bohemian people in Cedar Rapids and Linn county would\r\nbe complete without referring to the Sokols. This is a society whose\r\npurpose is physical culture. The society is well represented in Cedar\r\nRapids, and has among its members some of the best all around athletes\r\nin this country. In 1909 a team of six men of this organization\r\ncaptured the first prize at the National Contest in New York city of\r\nthe Bohemian Sokols Society in the United States. The society owns a\r\nfine building and gymnasium here. It is an old organization, dating\r\nback to about the time when the Reading Society was organized, at that\r\ntime being a branch fostered by the Reading Society. The society has\r\nseveral instructors of physical culture and gives to boys and girls,\r\nand young men and young women, a thorough course in gymnastics.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian people of this city are thoroughly and actively interested\r\nin the principle of modern fraternalism. Among this element the\r\nfraternal orders and societies find much favor and popularity. There\r\nare very few men and women of this nationality who do not belong to at\r\nleast one fraternal order, and there are many who belong to a half\r\ndozen fraternal orders. In fact the Bohemian element in the city of\r\nCedar Rapids is honey-combed with lodges, orders, and societies of\r\nfraternal character. The Reading Society, already mentioned, was the\r\nnucleus, from which, as time went on, manifold ramifications sprang,\r\nfinally developing into an extraordinary number of fraternal societies\r\nand lodges.\r\n\r\nAt first these societies were more of a national spirit and character,\r\nbut later the insurance feature became an important part. The Bohemian\r\npeople have great faith in fraternal insurance. The next thing after a\r\nhome is acquired, fraternal insurance is provided. Some of the\r\nsocieties are exclusively for men, and some are exclusively for women,\r\nbut the tendency of the last ten years is to permit both sexes to\r\nbecome members of the same lodge. This too has its advantages, and if\r\nfraternal orders are to be more than mere insurance companies, a\r\ngreater diversity of membership, greater benefits and advantages will\r\nflow from them. All the orders and lodges are in a prosperous\r\ncondition. Three fine and capacious halls have been built and there is\r\nneed and place for them all.\r\n\r\nThe C. S. P. S. hall was built in 1891, the Z. C. B. J. hall was built\r\nin 1908, and the Sokol hall in 1908. There is a Bohemian hall in Ely,\r\nIowa. The Z. C. B. J. is a large and flourishing fraternal order whose\r\nsupreme lodge has been located in Cedar Rapids since its organization\r\nin 1897. This in English is called the Western Bohemian Fraternal\r\nAssociation, and it is doing business in ten or twelve states in the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 there was an Odd Fellows lodge instituted, whose members are\r\nall Bohemians, and whose rituals and work are in the Bohemian language.\r\nThis lodge has the distinction of being the only Bohemian Odd Fellows\r\nlodge west of the Mississippi river. The spirit of fraternalism has had\r\na remarkably good influence upon the character and intelligence of the\r\nBohemian people. The financial benefits to the widows and children\r\nflowing from these societies may be great, but the moral, intellectual,\r\nand educational benefits to the members are immeasurably greater.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are many Bohemian communities and\r\nsettlements. In some of the eastern cities the settlements are very\r\nlarge, for instance in Chicago there are 100,000 Bohemians; in New York\r\nabout 40,000; in Cleveland about 40,000; and there are very large\r\nsettlements throughout Minnesota, the two Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas,\r\nand Texas.\r\n\r\nIn intelligence and educational advancement, in the broad scope and\r\nhigh ideals of modern fraternalism, in social progress and in business\r\nand industrial enterprise, and in the professions, the Bohemian people\r\nof Linn county and Cedar Rapids rank foremost among all the Bohemian\r\ncommunities in the United States. This is a recognized fact among other\r\nBohemian communities and cities in our country. We are proud of the\r\nfact that our city has won the beautiful title of \"Parlor City,\" but\r\nmore proud should we be of the fact that in all the Bohemian\r\ncommunities and large centers of Bohemian population from New York to\r\nCalifornia, Cedar Rapids is known as \"The Bohemian Athens of America.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_The Early Marriage Record_\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting book in the office of the county clerk at Marion is the\r\nfirst marriage record kept in the county. Through the courtesy of\r\nCounty Clerk William Dennis we are enabled to give below a record of\r\nmarriages that took place in the county from 1841 to 1855. The names\r\nand the dates have been transcribed with care, though it is possible\r\nsome names here printed are not correct in every particular, due to the\r\ninability to read the writing in the record. As a rule the penmanship\r\nof our early clerks was distinct and readable. This is true in especial\r\nmanner of the incumbency of Hosea W. Gray, who was clerk during most of\r\nthe years covered by this transcript.\r\n\r\nThe book consulted in the preparation of this chapter contains both the\r\nlicenses granted and the returns of the marriages. In a few instances\r\nthe names in the licenses are different from those given in the\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nA thing to be noted in this early marriage record is the youth of many\r\nof the parties. In many instances the records show the marriage of\r\nyoung girls of 15 and 16 years.\r\n\r\nA number of licenses are recorded, but there is no evidence in the book\r\nthat the marriages were ever celebrated, due doubtless to the failure\r\nof the officiating clergyman or justice to make the proper returns.\r\n\r\nMany names familiar in the early days appear in this record. And it is\r\nvaluable not only because it lists those pioneers who here set up their\r\nhousehold gods soon after they arrived in the county, but also because\r\nit gives the names of the early ministers and justices of the peace in\r\nLinn county.\r\n\r\nIn this record book are recorded the licenses of the ministers of the\r\ngospel who were authorized to perform the marriage ceremony. Here are\r\nsome of the names, many of them doubtless familiar to the survivors of\r\nthat time:\r\n\r\nReverends John Hodges, Michael Summer, John Stocker, William C. Rankin,\r\nIsrael C. Clark, F.

Where there were no navigable rivers the legislatures,\r\nand even congress, passed certain acts establishing roads. The\r\nTerritorial legislature which met in Burlington in 1838 and 1839 among\r\nmany other road laws approved the following passed January 25, 1839:\r\n\r\n     \"That Isaac [Israel] Mitchell, of Linn county, Iowa, John G.\r\n     Fay, of Cedar county, and Jonathan Pettibone, of Muscatine\r\n     county, be and are hereby appointed commissioners to lay out\r\n     a road commencing at Bloomington, Muscatine county, thence to\r\n     Rochester and Cedar county and thence to the county seat of\r\n     Linn county. That said commissioners, or a majority of them,\r\n     shall meet at Burlington on the first Monday of May next to\r\n     discharge their duties.\"--Section 3, p. 461, Laws of Iowa.\r\n\r\n     \"It is further enacted that Alfred Carter, Warren Stiles and\r\n     A. F. Russell, of Scott county, be and are hereby appointed\r\n     commissioners to lay out a territorial road commencing at\r\n     Davenport, Scott county, thence to Hickory Grove, thence to\r\n     Poston's Grove, thence to Red Oak Grove, thence to Pioneer\r\n     Grove, thence to Big Linn Grove, thence to the seat of\r\n     justice of Linn county, said commissioners to meet, or a\r\n     majority of them, to discharge their duties at Davenport on\r\n     the first Monday of May next.\"--Section 8, p. 462, Laws of\r\n     Iowa.\r\n\r\nA number of these laws were passed laying out what were known as\r\n\"territorial and state roads.\" For example, there was the well known\r\nDubuque-Iowa City road passing through Anamosa, Springville, and Mount\r\nVernon. Then there were the two well known roads passing through\r\nMarion, one known as the Toledo road running nearly directly west of\r\nCedar Rapids to Toledo, and a road much travelled in the early day; the\r\nother road branched from the Toledo road about four miles west of the\r\ncity and was an angling road known in this county as the Marengo road,\r\nthe State road, as well as the Des Moines road, which also was laid out\r\nover high ground in nearly a straight angling line to Marengo, and then\r\nwest through Brooklyn, Grinnell, and Newton to Des Moines. This road\r\nwas used much by the forty-niners crossing the state for the gold\r\nfields of California, and now and then some farmer has picked out of\r\nhis field where the old road has been changed little horse shoes, shoes\r\nused for oxen, hammers and hatchets, and other utensils which had been\r\nleft or lost by the early gold seekers.\r\n\r\nThere were two roads between Cedar Rapids and Marion well known in the\r\nearly days, one called the old Marion road and the other running about\r\nwhere the street railway now runs.\r\n\r\nAnother road which was much used in the early days was known as the\r\nCedar Rapids and Center Point road. It was much travelled by all people\r\nfrom the north part of the county.\r\n\r\nAnother road was the Marion-Mt. Vernon road, as well as the Western\r\nroad, and the Mt. Vernon-Ivanhoe Bridge road leading to Iowa City.\r\n\r\nThe Code of 1851, referring to the State roads, directs that these\r\nroads shall be maintained by the respective counties but that such\r\nState roads shall not be discontinued or diminished in size.--Sections\r\n557, 558, Code of Iowa, 1851.\r\n\r\nAt this time roads were under the supervision of the county court.\r\nLater they came under the supervision of the county supervisors.\r\n\r\nFor many years it was believed that a certain hill overgrown by trees\r\nnear the Milwaukee tracks in the edge of Kenwood had been a\r\nfortification erected by the United States government in the early days\r\nfor defending the settlers from Indian attacks.\r\n\r\nA school house was later erected on or near this locality and was known\r\nas \"Ft. George School House.\" Many of the old settlers remembered this\r\nlocality and called it the old fort. An investigation was made and the\r\nfollowing letter written by Samuel W. Durham explains itself:\r\n\r\n     \"The house was built by a man by the name of George, of\r\n     German descent, and afterwards bought and occupied by\r\n     Ambrose Harland who gave the little irregular tract and\r\n     house the name of Ft. George in honor of its first owner and\r\n     its having the appearance of being constructed to resist,\r\n     not Indians, but cold winds as they swept up Indian creek.\r\n     Harland was a character, born in Kentucky, removed to\r\n     Crawfordsville, Indiana, and was the sheriff of that county.\r\n     This was the home of Lew Wallace, the author of Ben Hur, and\r\n     also the home of Henry S. Lane who first named Abraham\r\n     Lincoln as president in a convention in Chicago in 1860.\r\n     Harland moved to Linn county succeeding Hosea W. Gray as\r\n     sheriff, and was succeeded by me in that office. He was a\r\n     six-footer and large and would fight, but once fell heavily\r\n     before Perry Oxley's huge fist.\"\r\n\r\nThe person who erected the house which appeared like a fort was no\r\nother than George Hesing, who owned the land and was a peculiar\r\ncharacter in his day. He did plant cottonwood trees around the house\r\nand also scraped up dirt so as to keep out the wind and snows as much\r\nas possible from his yard. In a few years the trees grew up and the\r\nrubbish accumulated, and they gave the place the appearance and made it\r\nlook like an old abandoned fortification. It is said that a certain Mr.\r\nWillard having charge of the erection of a school house near this\r\nlocation named it the \"Ft. George School House,\" which name it bore as\r\nlong as it stood there.\r\n\r\nA number of plats have been filed in the recorder's office at Marion,\r\nand these have again been transcripted for public use, but before towns\r\ncould be platted a number of towns were staked out before the land was\r\nlaid out and surveyed by the government; of these plats we have no\r\nrecord. The first plat was, no doubt, that of Westport, located on the\r\nbanks of the Cedar river and near Bertram. This was staked out by\r\nIsrael Mitchell July 4, 1838. Ivanhoe was laid out some distance below\r\nat the present Ivanhoe bridge in the same year. Another town was staked\r\nout by J. Wilbert Stone along the Cedar river at the lower rapids\r\nwithin the corporate limits of the present Cedar Rapids. There is no\r\nrecord of any plat of this town. In 1844 Westport was again platted as\r\nNewark by James M. Doty. This is the first recorded plat and seems to\r\nhave been filed November 21, 1844, by John Zinbar, recorder. (See Vol.\r\nA, p. 301, Lands.) This is now a corn field and has long since been\r\nvacated.\r\n\r\nNew Linden was another town platted in the early days; this plat was\r\nfiled by P. S. Embree, surveyor, April 15, 1853, being property owned\r\nby A. E. Simpson and A. P. Risley and located on sections 27 and 28,\r\ntownship 84, range 5, Brown township. This, also, now is nothing but a\r\ncorn field.\r\n\r\nAnother was the plat of New Buffalo in the town of New Buffalo which is\r\nfiled in Vol. 4, p. 217, of the Land Records of Linn county; this has\r\nalso been vacated.\r\n\r\nThe plat of the town of Mayfield was made by J. M. May and filed for\r\nrecord in Vol. 143, p. 624. It bordered on the Cedar river and embraced\r\nlot 4 and part of section 34, township 83, range 7. It also has been\r\nabandoned, although May's twenty-five additions, re-plats, etc., made\r\nby Major May, are still parts of additions to Cedar Rapids. Major May\r\nwas a man of enthusiasm, and speculated, believing, with Colonel\r\nSellers, that in every enterprise he undertook there would be millions,\r\nbut he died a poor, unknown and disappointed man.\r\n\r\nMany of the old town sites have been vacated, and many of the old\r\npostoffices and country stores which one found throughout the county in\r\nthe early fifties can no longer be found on the map. From _Iowa as It\r\nIs_, published in 1855, at page 153 we find the following notices\r\nconcerning Linn county towns and postoffices: Spring Grove, Boulder,\r\nCentral Point, Cedar Oak, Newark, St. Julien, Ivanhoe, and Hoosier\r\nGrove, besides such towns as Cedar Rapids, Palo, Marion, and Mount\r\nVernon. The book also mentions Iowa Conference Seminary, with a three\r\nstory building, and with Rev. S. N. Fellows as superintendent.\r\n\r\nN. H. Parker in his _Handbook of Iowa_, issued in 1856, mentions a few\r\nmore new towns not mentioned in the previous list, as follows: Fairfax,\r\nLisbon, Lafayette, Mon Diu, Necot, Oak Grove, Prospect Hill, St. Mary,\r\nSpringville, and Valley Farm. This author also speaks of the newspapers\r\npublished in the county, the _Register_ at Marion, and the _Times_, the\r\n_Farmer_, and the _Democrat_ at Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nAnother handbook of the state, published by J. G. Mills, of New York,\r\nin 1857, mentions the towns set out in the handbook of a year previous\r\nand adds the new town of much promise by the high-toned name of Paris,\r\nlocated in Jackson township, near the present town of Coggon.\r\n\r\nFew, if any, today can locate those villages and towns which sprang up\r\nfrom time to time over the county, and which long since have passed out\r\nof history and memory.\r\n\r\nOf the newspapers published at that time only the Marion _Register_ has\r\ncontinued to be issued. The others have passed away and one does not\r\nnow know who were the editors and publishers of these early attempts at\r\njournalism in the pioneer days. These newspapers, no doubt, did much in\r\nkeeping open the spirit of the people and in advertising the state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTLER PARK AT SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUSINESS DISTRICT OF SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_Some of the Old Settlers_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, impossible to say even now with any degree of\r\ncertainty, who was the first actual settler in Linn county. However, it\r\nis not very difficult to mention at least some of the early settlers.\r\nIt is said that Dyer Usher and James Ames came up the Cedar river as\r\nfar as the rapids on a hunting expedition as early as the spring of\r\n1836; how long these men remained in what later became Linn county is\r\nnot known, but it is not likely that they stayed very long. We have\r\npretty good evidence that later during the summer came Daniel C. Doty,\r\nhis two sons, James, and Elias, and nephew, Jacob Crane, as far as\r\nBertram and viewed the country expecting to locate when land was thrown\r\nopen for settlement. Mr. Doty was born in Essex county, New Jersey, in\r\n1764, had early drifted west to Cincinnati, and by boat had come down\r\nthe Ohio and up the Mississippi, landing at what is now Muscatine. His\r\nchildren were born in Ohio. They followed the Cedar river until they\r\nstruck what became later Linn county to locate claims. There were no\r\nsettlers here, and they found no people with whom to converse, but\r\nfigured that here would be a good location to get cheap land when this\r\nland was opened for settlement. They returned to Ohio for their\r\nfamilies, expecting to return the following spring, but they did not,\r\nin fact, return for three years on account of the financial depression.\r\nIsrael Mitchell staked out the town first called Westport in July,\r\n1838, which town was later called Newark, named in honor of Newark, New\r\nJersey, where the family originally came from. Here Elias Doty, Jr.,\r\nwas born in October, 1841. Elias Doty, Sr., erected the first sawmill\r\non Big creek in 1841, in the erection of which mill he was killed in\r\nthe raising of the timbers. Daniel Doty, Sr., had the following sons,\r\nto-wit: James, Elias, John, and Daniel, all young men who early drifted\r\nwest. Daniel C. Doty, the father of these sons, was never a resident of\r\nthis county, but simply came here to find homes for his children. He\r\ndied in Ohio in 1849; the widow died in Ohio in 1863 at the advanced\r\nage of ninety-eight.\r\n\r\nJames Doty, born in 1809, was the first real pottery maker in Iowa. He\r\nhad learned the trade in Ohio. This crude pottery building was standing\r\non the old homestead up to within a few years ago. At the time of his\r\ndeath, January 17, 1847, he had over three hundred jars, jugs, crocks,\r\netc., ready for delivery. In this early day there was great demand for\r\nsuch merchandise as it was something every farmer had to have, and it\r\ncould only be obtained in a few places and at high prices on account of\r\nthe transportation.\r\n\r\nAnother Linn county pioneer well known in the early days was Israel\r\nMitchell, who staked out the town of Westport in 1838. Mr. Mitchell was\r\nborn in Kentucky, January 15, 1796, the son of Moses Mitchell, of\r\nScotch descent, and on the mother's side, Elizabeth Grant, of Welsh\r\ndescent, and a near relative of Daniel Boone, the Indian fighter. As a\r\nyoung man Israel Mitchell attended a Kentucky college and graduated\r\ntherefrom. He studied for the ministry, but gave that up on account of\r\nhis voice, and later took a course in medicine, but gave up the\r\npractice, as his step-daughter, Mrs. Slavin, writes, \"because he was\r\ntoo tender hearted.\" He had studied law as well as surveying. After his\r\nmarriage he removed to Ohio in the early '20s with his wife and two\r\nchildren, viz: Angeline and John Mitchell. He soon drifted into\r\nIndiana, and from there he removed to Wisconsin, working in the lead\r\nmines near Apple river in the southwest part of the state as surveyor.\r\nFrom Wisconsin he came by way of Dubuque to Linn county in the spring\r\nof 1838 in company with John, James, and Chamber Hunter, and Jacob\r\nLeabo. They all settled on the banks of the Cedar river in sections 32\r\nand 33, township 83, range 6. Mr. Mitchell was a widower at this time\r\nand he and his children stayed with the Leabo family. At Marion he\r\nmarried Mrs. Mary Ross, nee Mary Arnold, a native of Princeton, New\r\nJersey, on November 7, 1845, Esquire Goudy, one of the first justices\r\nof the peace, performing the marriage ceremony according to the\r\nterritorial laws of Iowa. Of this marriage were born five children:\r\nLuther H., Caroline, Israel, Boone, and Maris Morton. By her first\r\nmarriage Mrs. Ross had four children. She died in Oregon in 1858.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell sat on the first grand jury summoned in the county, was\r\none of the first justices of the peace in the county, and was also the\r\nfirst probate judge. He acted as a frontier lawyer, did more or less\r\nsurveying, at which he was an expert, and in many ways was a most\r\nuseful man to the community. Mr. Mitchell was a true southerner, his\r\nhome was always open, and he did much entertaining. He spent much of\r\nhis time interesting his friends and acquaintances in new enterprises,\r\nand in various ways tried to build up a great town on the banks of the\r\nCedar river. Whether it was due to the failure of his new town to\r\nmaterialize or the western fever that got hold of him, we do not know,\r\nbut just at a time when he should have remained he saw fit to emigrate,\r\ngoing with oxen overland with his family in 1847, locating about eight\r\nmiles southwest of Portland, Oregon. Here he tilled the soil and became\r\na noted surveyor. In 1873 he returned to Linn county to visit his old\r\nfriends, giving glowing descriptions of the far west and especially of\r\nthe Spokane country. On his return by way of San Francisco to Portland\r\nhe fell in one of the gangways on the steamer, and received injuries\r\nfrom which he died a few days later after reaching home. Mr. Mitchell\r\nwas a member of the Presbyterian church and affiliated with the\r\ndemocratic party. J. J. Daniels, his old friend, described Judge\r\nMitchell as follows: \"He was truly an educated man, and in early life\r\nhad learned the science of surveying, and this was the work he was\r\nparticularly called for; when not engaged in this occupation he farmed\r\nand kept a ferry. When the writer became acquainted with him on the\r\nCedar river he was an active man on foot and could swim almost equal to\r\na duck; bathing in the Cedar in warm weather was his usual custom. He\r\nwas a medium sized man and stood very straight and erect, having black\r\nhair a little tinged with grey, large blue eyes, a high, round\r\nforehead, and in appearance resembled Edgar A. Poe, and was equally as\r\nbrilliant a poet as Poe, having enough manuscript to make a book of\r\npoems. He was truly a Christian man in many acts of kindness, and\r\nverified his profession of faith in a true Christian religion.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Ellis, Linn county's oldest living settler, was born in\r\nWestmoreland, county, Pennsylvania, January 20, 1817, emigrated to Ohio\r\nin 1837, later to Michigan, and started on foot to Iowa Territory in\r\nthe winter of 1838. He remained for a few weeks in Cedar county and\r\nstarted again on foot looking for a claim in the timber near some\r\nriver. Coming to the present site of Cedar Rapids the first man he\r\nfound was a man by the name of Hull, who held down a claim where the T.\r\nM. Sinclair Company packing house is now located; coming further up\r\nalong the river he found the tavern of Osgood Shepherd. Mr. Ellis liked\r\nthe place and staked out his claim on his present location near what is\r\nknown as Ellis Park. He was at work there cutting wood one day when\r\nShepherd came along with another man, and insisted that this claim\r\nbelonged to him. Ellis was not easily frightened, and as Shepherd was\r\ngoing to attack him, Ellis raised his ax and threatened to chop his\r\nhead in two if he took another step. This threatening attitude on the\r\npart of Ellis frightened Shepherd and he and his companion retreated,\r\nEllis never being disturbed afterwards. Shepherd never referred to the\r\nmatter. The next summer when Shepherd's father died Ellis and\r\nLichtebarger made the coffin and assisted at the burial, when Shepherd\r\nseemed to be very much touched by the kindness of these two men and\r\nthanked them profusely.\r\n\r\nEllis became a friend of the Lichtebarger boys and also of O. S.\r\nBolling. Bolling and Ellis assisted Tom Lewis, the old pioneer, to get\r\nhis wagon and cattle across the river when he came west to locate, on\r\nwhat became later known as \"Lewis Bottoms.\" Ellis worked for awhile at\r\nthe Winnebago Mission at Ft. Atkinson, Iowa, where he met a number of\r\nmilitary men who later became known in the Mexican war, as well as in\r\nthe Civil war.\r\n\r\nAs he was frequently in company with men who took newspapers and who\r\nhad travelled about the country, he heard of the gold excitement in\r\nCalifornia and at once crossed the country to Marion wanting to go\r\nwest. At Marion he met Dan Mentzer, a man by the name of Harvey, and\r\nanother person by the name of Green. They purchased an outfit and\r\nstarted for California in April, 1849, arriving at the diggings in that\r\nstate the same summer after many hard experiences. He remained for\r\nseveral years digging gold as a placer miner and keeping a grocery\r\nstore, and for a time he ran a stage between Georgetown and Coloma,\r\nearning express, passengers, and the mail. Here he met and associated\r\nwith Sutter, the old German who discovered the first gold diggings, as\r\nwell as his partner, saw Fair, Huntington, Mackey, and the boisterous\r\nStewart, some of them \"running saloons today and owning mines\r\ntomorrow.\" After remaining in California for seven years he returned\r\nhome by way of the Nicaragua route and there met and talked with\r\nGeneral Walker, the famous filibusterer.\r\n\r\nPhilip Hull, according to Robert Ellis, had arrived in what became\r\nCedar Rapids just a very few weeks before he came. He says: \"Hull was\r\nof my age and I took a liking to him. He weighed about 170 pounds, was\r\nabout five feet eight inches tall, had dark hair and was stoop\r\nshouldered. He was a native of Ohio, and returned to Illinois or Ohio\r\nin 1840 to get married, as he was very lonesome out here on the\r\nprairies of Iowa. Hull never returned to Cedar Rapids. Mr. Hull and I\r\nwalked to William Abbe's and bought four yoke of oxen, a wagon, and a\r\nbreaking plow. We had but little money so we agreed that in payment for\r\nthis property we should break 75 acres of land and cut and split 10,000\r\nrails, which we did. It took two men to break, one to handle the cattle\r\nand one to hold the plow. It was no easy job on a hot day when the oxen\r\nwould pull for a pond with all their might if not closely watched, and\r\nmany were the times they would give us the slip and would lie down in\r\nthe pond and we could do nothing but wait till the air cooled and night\r\ncame on. Neither one of us made anything, and I saw nothing of Mr. Hull\r\ntill I met him at Sacramento, California, where he had preceded me by\r\nseveral months. We often talked over our lives in Linn county, neither\r\none at the time even believing that Cedar Rapids had any future. Hull\r\nwas an agreeable companion, a splendid fellow and square in all his\r\ndealings. He preferred frontier life and would be content in no other\r\nlocality except on the frontier.\"\r\n\r\nEllis says further of Wm. Abbe:\r\n\r\n     \"Abbe and I were in partnership in dealing with the\r\n     government. Abbe made the deals with the government and I\r\n     made most of the purchases from the settlers. At one time\r\n     Abbe and I had just completed a contract with the government\r\n     for provisions, and then Indian Agent Harvey in St. Louis\r\n     insisted that we must also furnish 100 cattle within six\r\n     days at Ft. Atkinson. This was rather a difficult task but\r\n     Abbe said we had to do it and we rode away in a hurry back\r\n     home to buy up cattle and drive them back to be there in\r\n     time. We worked day and night and had the cattle at Ft.\r\n     Atkinson on time. As Abbe had to go to Prairie du Chien I\r\n     was ordered to return home with $1,000.00 in gold which had\r\n     been paid for the cattle. I did not like to go alone over\r\n     the open prairie with the money but there was no way out of\r\n     it and so I started bright and early. That night I reached\r\n     Quasqueton and stayed over night at a small tavern where\r\n     there were all kinds of people hanging about. The next day I\r\n     set out again and got down in the neighborhood of Center\r\n     Point and there spied a deer. I got off my horse and loaded\r\n     my gun, aimed, and fired. The horse shied and off it started\r\n     on a dead run with the gold in the saddle bags. I next\r\n     wanted to shoot the horse for it was worth much less than\r\n     the money, but before I could reload the horse was out of\r\n     range. I ran as fast as I could and in an hour found the\r\n     horse tied to a tree in the timber with the gold safe in the\r\n     saddle bags.\"\r\n\r\nAsked how about the deer, Mr. Ellis replied, \"Well, I never took time\r\nto see whether I killed that deer or not. I was so excited about that\r\ngold and that horse that I forgot the deer at that time and never\r\nturned around to look.\"\r\n\r\nSince his return home Mr. Ellis has lived quietly on his claim, which\r\nnow for the most part has been platted into city lots. Mr. Ellis is the\r\nonly person now living who can remember when he saw one cabin here\r\nbecome a city of 34,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nJohn J. Daniels, the son of Jeremiah Daniels, came to Bertram township\r\nin the spring of 1844, his father entering land on what is known as\r\nIndian creek, erecting a log house and barn thereon. J. J. Daniels was\r\none of the first school teachers in the county. He held many township\r\noffices, and was for a time county recorder. Jerry Daniels died in\r\n1882, and John J. Daniels a short time ago.\r\n\r\nJames Bassitt and wife came to Linn county in March, 1839, and Mrs.\r\nBassitt is supposed to have been the first white woman to cross Indian\r\ncreek, a stream which empties into the Cedar river below Cedar Rapids.\r\nA short time afterwards Rufus H. and Sarah Ann Lucore came from\r\nPennsylvania and stopped with the Bassitts. On the first day of April,\r\n1839, arrived Joseph H. and John Lichtebarger, locating on what became\r\nKingston or West Cedar Rapids; later a brother, Isaac, also arrived.\r\nThese brothers erected one of the first cabins, in May of that year, on\r\nthe west side of the river. It is still standing.\r\n\r\nAt what became Central City arrived in August, 1839, Joseph Clark and\r\nfamily; this place was for a long time known as Clark's Ford. Here Mr.\r\nClark erected a primitive grist mill by selecting a hollow gum and\r\nplacing in the trunk of the tree a stone; upon this was placed another\r\nstone which was operated by a long sweep and turned on a pivot; in this\r\nrude manner enough meal was ground out to supply the family.\r\n\r\nJoel and James Leverich arrived in this county some time in 1839, and\r\nchose for their home what became later known as \"Mound Farm.\" Ira\r\nLeverich jumped a claim which had been staked out in April of this year\r\nby Rufus Lucore and after more or less trouble, in which the settlers\r\ntook Lucore's part, Leverich had to yield and give up his pretended\r\nright. Joel was a noted character. He is described as a man of\r\ncommanding presence. For a number of years he controlled the elections\r\nand it was told that \"as Joel Leverich went so went Linn county.\" Dr.\r\nS. D. Carpenter, who arrived in 1849, has the following to say about\r\nJoel Leverich: \"I had hardly got settled until I was interviewed by old\r\nJoel Leverich, the noted character of Linn county of that day. He was\r\nknown as the 'bogus coon' because, as was alleged, he had to do with\r\ncounterfeiters. He was a power in politics and was the kind of a man\r\nfrom which the modern boss has evoluted. Joel looked me over, asked\r\nwhere I was from, where I was going, and what my business was, etc. I\r\nwas somewhat indignant and tried to be sarcastic, but Joel in\r\nterminating his interview with me squelched me by remarking, 'Young\r\nman, a fellow who wears such a hat as you may pass in this country, but\r\nI consider it d--d doubtful.' I, unfortunately, wore a black plug hat\r\nwhich was not the style in Iowa at that time. In after years Joe and I\r\nbecame fast friends and I became quite convinced that the shady stories\r\ntold of him were the talk of enemies who were jealous of him because he\r\nwas smarter than the greater majority of them. I was with him when he\r\ndied and although he was a free thinker he passed away with all the\r\ncalmness of a stoic philosopher.\" When on his death bed some one said\r\nto Leverich, \"Joe, you have burned the candle at both ends.\" \"Yes,\" he\r\nreplied, \"and now it burns me in the middle.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICNIC AT HOME OF GEO. L. DURNO, SPRINGVILLE, 1884]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLINOIS CENTRAL DEPOT, CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\nGeorge R. Carroll in his _Pioneer History_, speaking of Leverich, says:\r\n\"The Mound Farm did not remain long in the possession of Broady,\r\npossibly a year and a half, when it came into possession of the\r\nnotorious Joel Leverich; everybody knew him and everybody dreaded him,\r\nespecially when he was under the influence of liquor, which was often\r\nthe case. Even his best friends then felt it to be prudent to give him\r\na wide berth, not knowing what instant he would take it into his head\r\nto knock them down. Whiskey seemed to make a demon of him, and to\r\nattempt to reason with him while under its influence would have been as\r\nfutile as to try to reason with a cyclone. His poor wife, a most\r\npatient and estimable Christian woman, would sometimes hide away from\r\nhim for days lest in his fits of uncontrol and uncontrollable passion\r\nhe might take her life. And yet old Joe, as he was popularly called,\r\nhad a good deal of influence in the community. He was a strong partisan\r\npolitician, and whoever arrayed himself against him was sure to have a\r\nhard battle to fight and in the end would very likely meet with defeat.\r\nHe was as keen and cunning and wily as the old serpent himself, and it\r\nwas very hard to circumvent him in his plans. He was accused of\r\nharboring horse thieves and of making counterfeit money; as to whether\r\nhe ever did either or not I could not say.\"\r\n\r\nWhile T. S. Parvin was United States attorney at Muscatine Joel\r\nLeverich was tried for counterfeiting, and while Parvin had said some\r\nhard things about Joel's mode of making a living he had also said some\r\nvery nice things about Joel's wife. Later Leverich called on Parvin at\r\nthe hotel, insisting upon speaking with him. Parvin's friends warned\r\nhim not to do so as Joe would likely kill him, but Mr. Parvin thought\r\nhe would take his chance and Joe did see him. Leverich said, \"Ain't you\r\nafraid of me?\" \"No,\" replied Parvin, \"you can kill me if you want to\r\nbut you cannot scare me.\" \"Well,\" replied Joe, \"I admire your grit; I\r\ncame not to scare you or to hurt you but to tell you that you did tell\r\nthe truth about my wife.\" Some time after that Parvin passed where\r\nLeverich lived and accepted of Mr. Leverich's hospitality.\r\n\r\nJoel Leverich's brother, James, was a saloonkeeper in Cedar Rapids and\r\nwhen he ascertained that Joel's death was due to his dissipation,\r\ncausing a serious stomach trouble, he quit the business. Joel Leverich\r\nsold his claim in 1843 to Judge Greene. He resided near the McCloud Run\r\nfor a short time and then moved to town, dying in the '40s.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unique characters in Cedar Rapids, and a person we know\r\nthe least about, was Osgood Shepherd, who was a hunter and trapper and\r\nwho is said to have erected the first log cabin on the banks of the\r\nCedar river where the Y. M. C. A. building now stands, unless Wilbert\r\nStone's claim is correct that he was first. When Robert Ellis came to\r\nthe Shepherd tavern in April or May, 1838, Shepherd had lived here for\r\nsome time. He had a wife and his father was living with him at that\r\ntime, and he also had a number of men who hung about his place, but\r\nwhat their business was no one knew. The log house was about 16×20,\r\ncovered with clapboards which were held in place by logs on top with\r\nends protruding at the gables. There were also in the family three\r\nchildren, who made things lively about the house. This small cabin was\r\nknown as Shepherd's Tavern. From Mr. Ellis's description of Shepherd,\r\nhe was more than six feet tall, of a sandy or reddish complexion, was\r\ngood natured as a rule and was an accommodating and agreeable landlord.\r\nHe was accused of being a horse thief, but Mr. Ellis does not know that\r\nhe ever engaged in this kind of business. However, this is true, that\r\nhis morals were not of the highest order and it is believed that he\r\nharbored horse thieves who, in fact, were his special favorites. On the\r\nvarious islands in the river they secreted their stolen goods. It was\r\nalso stated that in Wisconsin he was convicted of horse stealing and\r\nsent to the penitentiary, but how true this is no one knows. His father\r\nand one or two children died here and were buried on top of the hill\r\nwhere the Cedar Rapids Candy Company's large building has since been\r\nerected. Mr. Ellis says that Shepherd told him he was from New York\r\nstate and for some time had been a sailor on the lakes before coming\r\nwest. He held all the land as a squatter, and when N. B. Brown, Addison\r\nDaniels, H. G. Angle, and others came they had to buy Shepherd off in\r\norder to get title to this property. The patent to this land was dated\r\nDecember 1, 1845, although quit claim deeds and prior rights were dated\r\nin 1843, Addison Daniels and Nicholas B. Brown being the patentees. The\r\npatents included grants in the amount of two hundred and sixty-nine\r\nacres, and showed that they had paid the amount due at the land office\r\nat Marion according to the provisions of Act of Congress of April 24,\r\n1820.\r\n\r\nOsgood Shepherd had a friend named Bill Fisher, who always stuck by\r\nhim, and of whom Shepherd's father used to say, \"that when he moved\r\nsomething was going to happen, but it was not very often that he\r\nmoved.\" He was a slow-going, lazy sort of an individual, and what\r\nShepherd saw in Fisher, Ellis never knew. Nothing is known of Fisher\r\nand what became of him. In the fall of 1841 Shepherd removed to\r\nWisconsin and was later killed in a railway accident. His widow married\r\na person by the name of Carpenter and removed to Linn county, residing\r\nnear Center Point. What became of the Shepherd family no one has been\r\nable to learn.\r\n\r\nOsgood Shepherd and the pioneer settlers with whom he associated were\r\nperhaps no worse or no better than the average frontiersmen. They had\r\nbeen trained in hardship and sordid poverty, and the women bore the\r\nstamp of the early pioneers, devoted to their families, shirking no\r\nhardships, ever willing to move westward on account of the freedom\r\ngained and the opportunities offered.\r\n\r\nOf a different type of mankind was the progressive, enterprising and\r\nenthusiastic Nicholas B. Brown, who purchased Shepherd's claim, the\r\nmost prominent figure in the history of the early days of Cedar Rapids.\r\nMr. Brown arrived in 1840, purchasing the rights of Shepherd with\r\nAddison Daniels and others. On August 4, 1841, he began surveying what\r\nwas then known as Rapids City. He improved the water power which Brown\r\nearly foresaw would make the town. A saw mill was completed in 1842 and\r\nthe waters of the Cedar began to make its machinery hum; this was the\r\nfirst real enterprise of which the town could be proud. A woolen\r\nfactory was also erected by Brown, which was later disposed of to the\r\nBryan family. In 1846 and 1847 a grist mill was also added. On account\r\nof his many enterprises in which he had to depend on others Mr. Brown\r\nwas involved in much litigation, but he was a born fighter for whatever\r\nhe thought was right and accumulated a fortune because he had the\r\ntenacity of purpose to hold on to what he had purchased. As a pioneer\r\nhe did some excellent work and certainly was one of the shrewdest\r\nbusiness men of Cedar Rapids in his day and generation.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown was born in the state of New Jersey in 1814, removing as a\r\nyoung man to the state of Kentucky. His first wife was Catherine Craig,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Craig, one of the pioneers. She lived only a few\r\nyears. His second wife was Susan Emery, daughter of one of the early\r\nsettlers of this city. Mr. Brown died in 1880, one of the most honored\r\nand respected men in the community, survived by his widow and two sons,\r\nEmery Brown and Harry Brown. The widow died in 1909, one of the best\r\nknown and most respected in the city, having personally known nearly\r\nall of the settlers in the '50s and '60s.\r\n\r\nDyer Usher is said to have hunted and trapped in Linn county as early\r\nas 1836 in company with one Jim Ames; how true this is cannot be\r\nascertained, but he did come to locate in 1838. He came of a sturdy\r\nfamily, was born in Ohio, and at the age of eighteen in 1832 he crossed\r\nthe Mississippi, being one of the first white settlers to step upon\r\nIowa soil. Mr. Usher brought the first divorce suit in Linn county.\r\nThis business has grown by leaps and bounds since that time. He\r\nattended for a number of years the old settlers meetings and was a well\r\nknown figure in the early days in this county. Mr. Usher was thrifty,\r\nhonest, and fair in his dealings. He died December 11, 1894, at the age\r\nof eighty years. His widow, Rosanna Harris, died in 1909 at Covington\r\nat the age of seventy-nine. She was born June 6, 1829, in London,\r\nCanada, and with her parents emigrated to Iowa in 1845. She was united\r\nin marriage to Dyer Usher July 29, 1847. To this union were born twelve\r\nchildren, of whom five survived her: Willard R., of Alberta, Canada,\r\nMrs. Alice Harris, of Estherville, Mrs. A. H. Miller, of Cedar Rapids,\r\nMrs. Ray Lockhart, of Shellsburg, and Dyer N. Usher, of Covington. She\r\nhad been a resident of Linn county for sixty-three years.\r\n\r\nIt is still a disputed question as to who was the first actual settler\r\non what later became Cedar Rapids. It is true that Shepherd ran a sort\r\nof hotel or tavern and was the best known man in this part of the\r\ncountry in that early date, but it is not likely that he was the first\r\nman to build a log cabin here. Philip Hull had been located in the\r\nlower end, when Ellis arrived in 1838, and Ellis also found William or\r\nWilbert Stone in possession of the land on the west side of the river,\r\nand he was the one who staked out what he called \"Columbus\" in 1838,\r\nhaving previously staked out Westport and sold his claim to John Henry.\r\n\r\nInformation as regards William Stone has lately been discovered through\r\na daughter residing at North Liberty. She states that her father's name\r\nwas James Wilbert Stone, but he was commonly called William or Billy;\r\nthat he was born in the state of Rhode Island and drifted west into\r\nIowa in 1832 or 1833, and that he always asserted that he built the\r\nfirst cabin on land which later became Cedar Rapids. It is said that he\r\ndrifted west by way of Muscatine or Rock Island and followed the Cedar\r\nriver as far as Ivanhoe, later coming to the rapids of the Cedar river.\r\nMr. Ellis says that he knew William Stone very well; that he was a\r\nquiet, congenial, splendid fellow, and at this time resided on the west\r\nside, having a claim along the river extending northward to the bluff,\r\nand that a Mr. Galloway claimed south of a large cottonwood tree on the\r\nsame side of the river. Stone and Galloway were on good terms and owned\r\nthe adjoining claims. John Young and a man by the name of Granger, O.\r\nShepherd, and Philip Hull were the owners or claimants of the land on\r\nthe east side of the river. The daughter of Stone asserts that her\r\nfather always said that he first located his claim on the east side of\r\nthe river. It may be that Stone may have moved across the river after\r\nShepherd erected his tavern, and made claim to the land near and\r\nadjoining the rapids. It is intimated by Ellis that Stone and Shepherd\r\nwere not on the best of terms and Shepherd, being a large, pompous kind\r\nof a person, he might have driven the more quiet and less assertive new\r\nneighbor across the river. The daughter of William Stone, or James\r\nWilbert Stone, Mrs. Elizabeth Hrdlicka, states that her father bought\r\ngoods and traded with the Indians for furs for some years, and that the\r\nlast time her father talked to her he told her that he was sorry he\r\never gave up the town of Cedar Rapids but did not think then that it\r\nwould amount to anything. In 1843 he removed from what was Cedar Rapids\r\nto the Iowa river and married Elizabeth G. Brown and settled in Oxford\r\ntownship, Johnson county. To this union were born two girls: one, the\r\neldest, died and the second girl, Elizabeth, now Mrs. Hrdlicka, was\r\ntaken by her grandfather, Joseph Brown, on her mother's death when the\r\ndaughter was only four weeks old. After the death of his wife Stone\r\nremoved to Hudson, St. Croix county, Wisconsin. He returned to see his\r\ndaughter about once a year. He died at the age of forty-eight years in\r\nthe state of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIt seems from the story of the daughter of Stone, who is still living,\r\nthat James Wilbert Stone was undoubtedly the first actual settler on\r\nthe site which later became Cedar Rapids. From investigation it seems\r\nthat Shepherd may have jumped Stone's claim and for that reason Stone\r\nremoved across the river.\r\n\r\nIn Bailey & Hair's _Gazetteer_, 1865, the following mention is made of\r\nWilliam Stone: \"The next [town site] in order of time was called\r\nColumbus, built by William Stone, in September, 1838. He abandoned his\r\ntown the next spring, then being a single log cabin. The site was that\r\noccupied by the present city of Cedar Rapids.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stone was a speculator and a trader and had made some money trading\r\nwith the Indians prior to the advent of Shepherd. This is true, that\r\nStone did not harbor any people of unsavory reputations, and his whole\r\nlife bears the imprint that he was a gentleman even on the frontier.\r\nSuch a person people would not remember as well as a frontier character\r\nlike Shepherd. Shepherd, on the other hand, whatever may have been his\r\nfailings, was a man of a big heart, who attracted people to him. He had\r\nthe love of adventure, and it is not any secret but that he harbored\r\nthieves and gave them more or less encouragement. Mr. Stone, on the\r\nother hand, was an honest, quiet man, the opposite of his neighbor, and\r\nit is not to be wondered at that they did not get along.\r\n\r\nAnother settler who came here at an early date was O. S. Bowling, or\r\nBolling, who came in the summer of 1838 making a claim on the west side\r\nof the river and in whose honor Bowling's Hill in the south part of the\r\ntown was named. Mr. Bowling was a quiet man, a good neighbor, and one\r\nuniversally loved by the old settlers.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1839, came Thomas Gainor and David W. King. These gentlemen\r\nfound Wilbert Stone, the Lichtebarger brothers, and the claims of\r\nYoung, Hull, Ellis, and Bowling. It is said that Mrs. Rosanna Gainer,\r\nwife of Thomas Gainer, was the first white woman to locate on the west\r\nbank of the river and consequently would be the second woman to locate\r\nin what became Cedar Rapids, Mrs. Osgood Shepherd being the first. Mrs.\r\nGainer did not reside long in Cedar Rapids, as she died June 8, 1840,\r\ngiving birth to a daughter who also died the same summer.\r\n\r\nDavid W. King became one of the most enterprising of the men of that\r\nearly day. He ran a ferry, platted the town of Kingston, and died, the\r\nowner of much land, in the autumn of 1854. His death caused much sorrow\r\nin Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1839, arrived Isaac Carroll and family, consisting of nine\r\npersons, all of whom were well known by the early settlers. A son, Rev.\r\nGeorge R. Carroll, has written interestingly of the Carrolls, Weares,\r\nand others of the early settlers in his _Pioneer Life in and Around\r\nCedar Rapids from 1839 to 1849_.\r\n\r\nAnother early character was John Vardy, who arrived in July 1841, and\r\nbuilt, it is stated, the first frame house at the corner of Third\r\nstreet and Sixth avenue, during the summer of 1842. Mr. Vardy was a\r\ncabinet maker and an all-round person in the use of tools. He removed\r\nto Texas in 1856 where he died in the fall of 1878.\r\n\r\nAnother of the old settlers was Thomas Downing, a native of Posey\r\ncounty, Indiana, and a tailor by trade who at the age of nineteen\r\ndrifted into Iowa and in the early '40s came to Linn county. He was a\r\nclerk in the Daniels Company store, removing in 1855 to Waverly to\r\nconduct a business for Greene Bros., of Cedar Rapids. He died in\r\nWaverly in 1896.\r\n\r\nSamuel F. Hook was another of the residents of Cedar Rapids who came in\r\n1845 at the age of twenty-one, a native of the state of Virginia. He\r\ndied in 1848, and it is thought he was one of the first, if not the\r\nfirst, real store keeper within the boundaries of what became Cedar\r\nRapids.\r\n\r\nJ. H. Kelsey was born in New York state in 1819, and arrived in Cedar\r\nRapids in 1848. He was a carpenter by trade. He removed to Vinton in\r\n1863, going later to Nebraska where he passed away some time ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHODIST CHURCH, CENTER POINT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH MAIN STREET, TROY MILLS]\r\n\r\nSteve L. Pollock, a native of Pennsylvania, arrived in Cedar Rapids in\r\nthe early '40s and married Marilla Lucore, a daughter of one of the\r\nearly settlers, in March, 1844. He was the pioneer blacksmith and is\r\nsupposed to have built the third or fourth house in the city. Harrison\r\nCampbell, it is stated, was the owner of the first blacksmith shop, in\r\n1843. Mr. Pollock emigrated west in 1865 and died in Hood River,\r\nOregon, in 1902. He was a brother-in-law of William Stewart, one of the\r\nold settlers of this city, both of them well and favorably known among\r\nthe early pioneers of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nHiram Deem was a native of Ohio and at the age of twenty-eight or\r\ntwenty-nine located at Cedar Rapids and hired out to N. B. Brown. He\r\nhelped to build the dam across the river, erected saw mills, and\r\notherwise was a very useful man in a town with the boom spirit that\r\nCedar Rapids had at that time. He was also one of the first justices of\r\nthe peace and many a scrap was settled in his house, which stood on\r\nFirst street on the west side. He entered the army and died from\r\nexposure in a hospital boat in January, 1863.\r\n\r\nWhat later became known as \"Time Check\" was first entered by Farnum\r\nColby, who came here in 1839 and made his claim along the river about a\r\nmile northwest of the First avenue bridge near Robert Ellis's claim. He\r\nwas a native of Pennsylvania and a very useful, hard-working man. From\r\nhere he removed to Olin, Jones county, where he died some years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the early '40s also came Charles R. Mulford from Hoboken, New\r\nJersey, and at once began as a town merchant, opening a store in the\r\nVardy house on Third street and Sixth avenue. He was one of the most\r\nwide-awake business men of that day and had a good business, but was\r\ncaught with the gold fever and emigrated in 1849 to California, where\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known men in the state in an early date was Col.\r\nWilliam H. Merritt. Mr. Merritt was born in New York city September 12,\r\n1820, and received a fair education at Lima Seminary. At the age of\r\neighteen he was compelled to rely on his own resources and sought the\r\nwest, settling in Rock Island, Illinois, where he obtained a clerkship.\r\nThrough government officials and others he was sent to Ivanhoe on the\r\nRed Cedar river in 1839 to take charge of an Indian trading depot.\r\nIvanhoe was a squatter town, being staked out in October, 1838, by\r\nAnson Cowles. To this place, which was expected to become a large\r\ntrading center, came also at the same time George Greene, who taught\r\nschool in the vicinity during the winter of 1839. Mr. Merritt ran the\r\nstore with considerable ability, and long before the Civil war showed\r\nhis presence of mind and bravery. At this time, like in all other\r\nstores of its kind, whiskey, tobacco, and groceries were sold over the\r\nsame counter, and one day a number of Indians came, insisting on buying\r\n\"goody toss,\" designated in English as whiskey. Mr. Merritt refused, as\r\nhe had such orders from his employers, but the Indians insisted and\r\nbegan to take possession of the store, and intended to drive the young\r\nclerk out. A few pioneer hangers-on fled, but not so the young clerk in\r\ncharge of the goods and the store. He got hold of an axe and with this\r\nhe cleaned out single handed a whole squad of Indians, who left as\r\nquickly as they had made their appearance, much to the surprise of the\r\nwhite settlers, who up to this time had always fled when the redskins\r\noutnumbered them ten to one.\r\n\r\nMr. Merritt was related to George Greene by marriage, and the two men\r\nwere much together from this time on. Mr. Merritt became clerk in the\r\nAssembly at Burlington in 1841 and in company with George Greene edited\r\nthe _Miners' Express_ at Dubuque. Later he was caught with the gold\r\nfever rush and emigrated to California, returning in 1851, becoming\r\nonce more editor and part owner of the old paper. In 1855 he removed to\r\nFt. Dodge, being appointed registrar of the land office at that place.\r\nHe returned once more to Cedar Rapids and founded a banking house under\r\nthe style of Greene, Merritt & Co., which firm later disposed of their\r\nbanking interests to Sampson C. Bever. He was nominated for governor\r\non the democratic ticket in 1861 but was defeated by Samuel J.\r\nKirkwood. Later he enlisted and served with distinction during the\r\nCivil war.\r\n\r\nAfter the war Colonel Merritt became editor of the _Statesman_, one of\r\nthe leading democratic papers of the state. He died at his home in Des\r\nMoines in 1891, mourned by a large circle of friends all over the\r\nstate. Colonel Merritt was for half a century one of the most all-round\r\nmen in Iowa and a leader of his party.\r\n\r\nThe Weare family arrived here in 1848 and for more than fifty years\r\nwere prominent factors in the upbuilding of Cedar Rapids. John Weare\r\nbecame a noted banker and railroad promoter. Charles Weare became\r\nengaged in constructing railroads and took charge of large contracts,\r\nwas mayor of Cedar Rapids, postmaster, and consul in foreign countries.\r\nHe was also connected with the First National Bank of Cedar Rapids, as\r\nwell as with the Cedar Rapids Water Company. George Weare became a\r\nnoted banker in Sioux City, and P. B. Weare and Ely E. Weare promoters\r\nand members of the board of trade in the city of Chicago. Later they\r\npromoted steamboat traffic in the Yukon country at the time of the gold\r\nfever rush. All these were sons of John Weare, Sr., who removed here\r\nfrom Michigan in the spring of 1845 in order to be with his children\r\nwho had previously emigrated. Mr. Weare, Sr., held the office of\r\njustice of the peace up to the time of his death in 1856.\r\n\r\nWilliam Stewart, a native of Pennsylvania, located in Cedar Rapids in\r\n1847 and entered the blacksmith shop of Pollock, later putting up his\r\nown shop, and besides operating a large farm. Mr. Stewart removed to\r\nCalifornia and died there in 1891, having acquired a fortune in Cedar\r\nRapids real estate.\r\n\r\nSamuel S. Johnson was another Pennsylvanian who came to Cedar Rapids in\r\n1847. He was a carpenter and joiner by trade but gave that up for\r\nfarming on arriving in Linn county. Mr. Johnson lived to the grand old\r\nage of eighty-five, and passed away at the home of his daughter, Mrs.\r\nRobert Taylor.\r\n\r\nOne of the most enterprising, active business men who located in Cedar\r\nRapids in 1849 was Dr. Seymour D. Carpenter, who was then twenty-three\r\nyears of age, and had ostensibly come out here to practice medicine,\r\nbut he later turned his attention to land speculations, politics, and\r\nother enterprises. Dr. Carpenter is still residing in Chicago, enjoying\r\na hale and hearty old age.\r\n\r\nIn order to give the reader an impression of Cedar Rapids as it was at\r\nthat time we shall quote Carpenter's splendid article contained in the\r\n_History of Crescent Lodge_, by J. E. Morcombe, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I turned north and went to Ottumwa where I met Judge\r\n     Greene, then a member of the Supreme Bench of Iowa; he\r\n     persuaded me that Cedar Rapids was in the near future to\r\n     become a metropolis and I decided to go there. After four\r\n     days' hard riding and swimming several swollen streams, I\r\n     struck the town on the afternoon of June 14, 1849; I crossed\r\n     the river on a rope ferry operated by David King, who lived\r\n     in a cabin on the west side; on the other side of the river\r\n     stood a cabin, once the home of a man named Shepherd, and\r\n     said to be the resort of thieves in an early day. I can not\r\n     say that I was very favorably impressed by the thirty or\r\n     forty small one-story unpainted houses that were scattered\r\n     about near the river. There seemed to be a great deal of\r\n     sand, and the houses were so situated that there was no sign\r\n     of a street. There were three two-story houses, one on the\r\n     river near the foot of what is now Third avenue called the\r\n     'Park House' in which the Greenes had their store, one on\r\n     Second street in which John Coffman kept a hotel, and one on\r\n     Third avenue back of the Dows & Ely block, also a hotel. I\r\n     was discouraged and would have travelled further but only\r\n     had about $10.00 left and from necessity had to stop. I put\r\n     up at the Coffman hotel which, as I have said, was a\r\n     two-story structure with a wing; it had been built of\r\n     unseasoned oak lumber and was not plastered; the whole of\r\n     the second story of the main building was in one room and\r\n     contained eight or ten beds and was the common sleeping room\r\n     of the guests. The lumber had shrunk and there could be no\r\n     complaint as to ventilation, however short the\r\n     accommodations might be in other respects....\r\n\r\n     \"Within a week I made the acquaintance of all the people of\r\n     the town. Among the leading persons were William and Joseph\r\n     Greene, brothers of the Judge, Lowell and Lawson Daniels,\r\n     Homer Bishop and John Weare, all of whom were merchants. The\r\n     three stores of which they were the proprietors would not\r\n     compare well with the department stores of today, but all\r\n     the same they were department stores and in their\r\n     miscellaneous stocks the customer could find all he\r\n     wanted--from castor oil to broad axes.\r\n\r\n     \"Pollack and Stewart were the blacksmiths, and the\r\n     carpenters and wagon makers were represented, but I can not\r\n     recall their names. There was also a saloon kept by James\r\n     Leverich, a brother of Joe, a respectable man and a good\r\n     Mason. The inhabitants were mostly young people, John Weare,\r\n     Sr., Deacon Kennedy and Porter Earl being the exceptions. I\r\n     found three doctors already located, Dr. Mansfield, Dr.\r\n     Traer and Dr. Larabee, the latter being what was called a\r\n     'steam doctor.' Isaac Cook and Henry Harmon represented the\r\n     law.\r\n\r\n     \"The town was by no means dull; emigrants were coming daily,\r\n     and the saw mill operated by John Weare, Jr., was kept busy\r\n     cutting lumber for the new houses that were going up. There\r\n     was no church building, but Parson Jones preached in the\r\n     school house, as did preachers of other denominations, and\r\n     Sunday schools and Bible classes were in full blast.\r\n\r\n     \"On the Fourth of July a grand ball was given at the Coffman\r\n     Hotel, to which flocked young people from Marion and all the\r\n     surrounding country; there were at least fifty couples. The\r\n     beds were removed from our common sleeping quarters, which,\r\n     decorated with green boughs, became a ball room. Every part\r\n     of the house was crowded and the fun was fast and furious.\r\n     Only one mishap slightly marred the festivities; near a\r\n     stove pipe hole at one end of the room the floor was\r\n     defective, and a husky reveler of more than ordinary weight\r\n     while executing the double shuffle broke through and fell\r\n     upon the heads below; no injury was done and the dance went\r\n     on.\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Mansfield took me as a partner and in company with\r\n     Judge Cook we had a room 10×16 in a small one-story building\r\n     opposite the mill, the other part being occupied by S. L.\r\n     Pollock and family; his blacksmith shop was nearby. Our\r\n     medicines were kept on a shelf and a store box made a table;\r\n     our bunks occupied one side and a few stools and two split\r\n     bottom chairs made up our furniture. We took our meals at\r\n     the Coffman Hotel; our field of practice embraced the\r\n     settlers, not numerous, in the valleys of the Cedar and Iowa\r\n     rivers and their tributaries; we made very long rides. I was\r\n     called to see a patient two miles above the present town of\r\n     Vinton not yet begun; I got lost in the night and waited for\r\n     daylight under a tree on the bank of the river at the very\r\n     place where Vinton now stands. Bilious fever and ague were\r\n     the prevailing diseases, all the newcomers having to undergo\r\n     one or both....\r\n\r\n     \"We had mail three times a week from Dubuque and Iowa City;\r\n     the Higley brothers did the service in a two-horse hack; I\r\n     think Joseph Greene was postmaster. John Weare, Sr., was\r\n     justice of the peace; he was a very original character, fond\r\n     of company and full of interesting reminiscences extending\r\n     back to the war of 1812 in which he had lost a leg. His\r\n     small office was in the rear of Mrs. Ely's residence which\r\n     stood on the ground where the Dows and Ely block now is. He\r\n     gave 'nicknames' to many people and places which stuck to\r\n     them like burrs; the First Presbyterian church building was\r\n     begun that summer and as the walls were built of cement, Old\r\n     Mr. Weare named it 'The Muddy,' which it retained to the\r\n     last day of its existence.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter states how they tried to promote a railway from Cascade\r\nto Fairfield, held meetings concerning railway extensions, and\r\nappointed delegates from various counties to these conventions to\r\ndiscuss the matter fully and to authorize the government to donate land\r\nand have eastern people furnish the money. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. J. F. Ely and myself were selected to go to Fairfield;\r\n     we left Cedar Rapids on December 3 and after a three days'\r\n     hard and cold travel reached Fairfield; Marion sent Col. I.\r\n     M. Preston and Dr. Ristine. The convention met in a small\r\n     school house; all the counties were represented; the Hon. C.\r\n     W. Slagle, of Fairfield, then a very young man, was chosen\r\n     president, and I was chosen secretary....\r\n\r\n     \"We departed for our various homes thinking the work half\r\n     done, but sad to relate Cedar Rapids had to wait ten years\r\n     longer for a locomotive. These two meetings were, I think,\r\n     the first railroad conventions held in the interior of the\r\n     state. Soon opposition claims were started for east and west\r\n     lines and our project was ignominiously called the 'Ram's\r\n     Horn.' The next year was quite a stirring one; new people\r\n     were coming in great numbers and many were leaving, for the\r\n     California gold fever had broken out. Several outfits left\r\n     Cedar Rapids, with one of them Dr. Mansfield, my partner,\r\n     whose place was taken by Dr. S. C. Koontz, a cousin of mine,\r\n     well known to the old citizens.\r\n\r\n     \"That year the first brick buildings were erected; a\r\n     dwelling on Iowa avenue, near Greene's opera house, and a\r\n     three-story building on Commercial street by Judge Greene,\r\n     which for a long time was the show building of the town; we\r\n     began to put on airs.\r\n\r\n     \"In the spring of 1852 a steamboat came to Cedar Rapids; it\r\n     was a great event and attracted people from near and far;\r\n     she brought a cargo of freight, among which were the\r\n     household effects of Mr. Bever and my father, both of whom\r\n     from that time forward became citizens of the town. This\r\n     year, also, came Mr. Daniel O. Finch with a printing press\r\n     and forthwith started the _Progressive Era_, the first paper\r\n     in the Cedar valley. [The _Era_ was established in 1851.]\r\n     Ezra Van Metre, a talented young lawyer from Circleville,\r\n     Ohio, also came that year. Everyone was rejoiced that we had\r\n     an organ and the editor was overwhelmed with original\r\n     matter. There were at least a dozen young fellows in the\r\n     town, myself among the rest, who thought they 'knew it all,'\r\n     and anxiously rushed into print. The paper changed hands in\r\n     a year or two, and became the _Cedar Valley Times_, and\r\n     continued until a few years ago.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter sold his practice to Dr. Koontz and went into the land\r\nbusiness and in politics. Again we must quote what he has to say about\r\nthe county seat fight which commenced the first few years he was here:\r\n\r\n     \"Cedar Rapids claimed that she was to be the commercial\r\n     metropolis and therefore ought to be the political center.\r\n     The question was brought to an issue by the county\r\n     commissioners ordering a new court house at Marion, subject\r\n     to the approval of the voters of the county. Cedar Rapids\r\n     opposed the measure, believing that the building would\r\n     insure the permanent location of the county seat. Then\r\n     ensued a most bitter canvass. The voters were deluged with\r\n     oratory. Marion put on the stump Judge Isbell, I. M.\r\n     Preston, Col. William Smyth, N. M. Hubbard, W. G. Thompson,\r\n     and R. D. Stephens, against whom Cedar Rapids opposed Jas.\r\n     J. Child, Ezra Van Metre, Donald McIntosh, A. S. Belt, E. N.\r\n     Bates, I. N. Whittam and others. Every school district was\r\n     canvassed and much bitter feeling engendered. The Marion\r\n     people were more adroit politicians and carried the\r\n     election, but the result did not discourage our citizens,\r\n     who asserted that no election could affect 'manifest\r\n     destiny.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. E. CHURCH, TROY MILLS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILL AT PRAIRIEBURG]\r\n\r\n     \"About 1852 Major J. M. May came to Cedar Rapids from\r\n     Janesville, Wisconsin. The Major was a stirring man with a\r\n     head full of schemes. He said that Cedar Rapids was a place\r\n     of immense possibilities and only wanted enterprise to make\r\n     it the great town of Iowa. He bought land at the lower part\r\n     of town adjoining that owned by my father, and land on the\r\n     west side adjoining the river and below that owned by David\r\n     King. He platted out town lots on both sides of the river,\r\n     and induced my father and King to do the same, which were\r\n     the first additions made to the original town. He also\r\n     surveyed the island, sent a plat to the general government\r\n     and took possession of it, much to the chagrin and surprise\r\n     of the old settlers. Then he began to agitate the question\r\n     of a free bridge. Everyone wanted a free bridge but were\r\n     undecided as to the location. The Major induced my father to\r\n     subscribe $1500.00, and he gave $1000.00, which with sums\r\n     contributed by others in the lower end of the town secured\r\n     the location below the island at the narrowest place in the\r\n     river. The bridge was completed and thrown open to the\r\n     public, I think, in the late fall of 1852, and proved a\r\n     great convenience. The construction was defective and when\r\n     the ice broke up in the spring, the heavy cakes knocked down\r\n     two of the piers, and destroyed the greater part of the\r\n     bridge. All the people of the town were collected on the\r\n     bank of the river watching the event, and two young women\r\n     who were crossing went down with the structure and were\r\n     drowned. This was the first bridge built at Cedar Rapids.\r\n     The next was a bridge of boats at the foot of Iowa avenue\r\n     which I believe was also swept away by ice.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter speaks next of the formation of the real company who had\r\nmoney and who meant business in the formation of what was then known as\r\nthe \"Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railway,\" which built from Clinton to\r\nCedar Rapids and to the Missouri river. \"Cedar Rapids was given first\r\ndirectors as follows: Geo. Greene, John Weare, H. G. Angle, S. C. Bever\r\nand S. D. Carpenter, which positions we held till the road was built to\r\nCedar Rapids.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the amount of money put up by these men in order to get\r\nthis railway it is said that $200,000.00 was pledged by Cedar Rapids,\r\nwhich amount was raised as follows: $100,000.00 by private subscription\r\nand $100,000.00 by city bonds. Greene & Weare, then bankers, subscribed\r\n$10,000.00; George Greene, $5,000.00; John Weare, $5,000.00; N. B.\r\nBrown, $5,000.00; S. C. Bever, $5,000.00; Gabriel Carpenter, $5,000.00,\r\nand numerous other smaller sums to make up the amount. Then a city\r\nelection was had and the $100,000.00 voted by an overwhelming majority.\r\nSurveys of the route were begun at once, and from Mount Vernon and\r\nCedar Rapids two lines were seen; one by the way of Marion, and the\r\nother by the river. It was ascertained that the latter route would be\r\nthe shorter and cheaper by $100,000.00 than the former, but the company\r\nproposed to adopt the Marion route if she would subscribe $100,000.00.\r\nThis she declined to do, and the river line was chosen. Work progressed\r\nslowly and the first year found the rails no further west than De Witt,\r\nClinton county.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter speaks of another railroad venture when a company was\r\nformed known as the \"Cedar Rapids & Missouri River Railroad Company\"\r\nwith L. B. Crocker, of New York, as president, and with Major Bodfish\r\nand a number of Cedar Rapids men as directors.\r\n\r\n     \"When the legislature assembled in 1859 and 1860 we invaded\r\n     the capital, and established our headquarters in an old\r\n     hotel near the river, the name of which I have forgotten.\r\n     Major Bodfish was the commissary of the body. We had no\r\n     money to expend, but determined to be hospitable. The Major\r\n     laid in a barrel of old rye whiskey; as it was before the\r\n     war, whiskey was cheap; also several boxes of cigars. One of\r\n     our strongest henchmen was J. W. Woodbury, a leading man\r\n     from Marshalltown, and with him Peter Hepburn, now an\r\n     honored congressman, then a very stripling, but showing\r\n     evident signs of what was in him. John A. Kasson was then a\r\n     young lawyer in Des Moines, and we secured him as our\r\n     attorney....\r\n\r\n     \"The lawmakers were not in a hurry, but towards the last of\r\n     the session they passed our bill, and you may be sure there\r\n     was great rejoicing in Cedar Rapids. On our return the\r\n     citizens gave us a grand banquet in Greene's Hotel, and we\r\n     felt that we had at last secured a substantial victory for\r\n     our city, as in fact it was, for thenceforth Marion could no\r\n     longer be our rival. The cars came to Cedar Rapids in the\r\n     summer of 1859, just ten years after we had our first\r\n     railroad meeting, and we felt at last that hope had ended in\r\n     fruition. An immense concourse greeted their arrival from\r\n     all parts of the surrounding country. General D. N. Sprague,\r\n     then mayor, welcomed the guests, and the citizens threw open\r\n     hospitable doors to all comers. From that time forward Cedar\r\n     Rapids assumed metropolitan airs as the leading town of the\r\n     Cedar valley.\"\r\n\r\nOn politics Dr. Carpenter speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"From the first, on my arrival at Cedar Rapids, I became an\r\n     active partisan. General A. J. McKean of Marion was the\r\n     acknowledged leader, but the following was small. At the\r\n     state convention in 1851, held in Iowa City, I was the sole\r\n     representative from Linn county, and there were not more\r\n     than fifty delegates from the whole state. State officers\r\n     were nominated and also a candidate for congress. Colonel\r\n     Henderson, the father of J. W. Henderson of Cedar Rapids,\r\n     was named for congress, and without much opposition I\r\n     secured the nomination for secretary of state for my friend,\r\n     Isaac Cook, who up to that time was entirely unknown. I well\r\n     remember with what surprise he received the news. Although\r\n     there was no chance for his election it was the beginning\r\n     with him of a long and useful career in many offices of\r\n     trust, alike honorable to him and his constituents. As time\r\n     rolled on and our population of immigrants from the north\r\n     and especially from the New England states, and with the\r\n     bearing of the whig party towards slavery, they became more\r\n     hopeful, and by the year 1853 or 1854, the whigs carried the\r\n     county, electing both members of the legislature and the\r\n     county officers. John P. Conkey was the first member of the\r\n     legislature living in Cedar Rapids, and at the same election\r\n     Isaac Cook was chosen for a county office.\r\n\r\n     \"About this time Charles Weare, Isaac Cook and many others\r\n     cut loose from their old convictions and became ardent free\r\n     soilers.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter speaks of how he abandoned medicine, how he opened a\r\nbanking house in 1855, and became a land owner, having at one time as\r\nmuch as 1,600 acres of land near where the town of Norway now stands.\r\nHe was first connected with Lehman & Kreider, later forming the\r\npartnership of Carpenter, Stibbs & Company, the firm doing business\r\nuntil 1861. Dr. Carpenter attended the convention at Chicago that\r\nnominated Lincoln and was one of the first to enlist in the Civil war\r\nas a surgeon. He was mustered out in 1865.\r\n\r\nHenry E., Harvey G., Wellington W., and Major M. A. Higley were for a\r\ngeneration merchants, financiers, and leaders in many enterprises in\r\nCedar Rapids. They were born in the state of Connecticut, coming to\r\nthis county in the early '40s. Henry and Harvey Higley for some time\r\noperated a line of stages from Dubuque to Iowa City, and for that\r\nreason knew personally nearly all the prominent men of Iowa in the '40s\r\nand '50s. Iowa City being the capital and Dubuque the most enterprising\r\ncity in the territory and state, the public men frequently travelled to\r\nand from these cities. Harvey Higley \"got caught\" with the gold fever\r\nand went to California, returning in a few years to Cedar Rapids. The\r\nHigley brothers made large fortunes in real estate which have descended\r\nto their children.\r\n\r\nThe brothers, C. J. and Jacob A. Hart, natives of Maryland, came to\r\nCedar Rapids in the early '50s, and for a generation were two of the\r\nmost successful lumber dealers in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nAlexander L. Ely was one of the early millers, who died in the '40s.\r\nHis brother, Dr. J. F. Ely, came later to look after the business\r\ninterests of his deceased brother, and for some fifteen or twenty years\r\nwas a successful practitioner in Cedar Rapids. He and his wife for a\r\ngeneration were leaders of the business and social life of this city.\r\n\r\nHomer Bishop was an old-time merchant, arriving in the early '40s, and\r\nfor eight years was postmaster of Cedar Rapids. He was a congenial\r\nperson, well known, and an enterprising and free-hearted man who did\r\nhis best to build up a city on what was then thought to be the western\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the first Scandinavian settler to locate within the confines\r\nof Linn county was Nels C. Boye, a native of Denmark, who emigrated to\r\nthe United States in 1827 and arrived in Muscatine in 1837 and located\r\nin the vicinity of Lisbon in 1838 where he purchased land and engaged\r\nin farming. Being brought up as a merchant he removed with his family\r\nto Iowa City in 1843 and for a time operated one of the most up-to-date\r\nstores in the new capital. On a business trip to St. Louis in 1849 he\r\nfell a victim to the cholera and died there on June 23. A number of his\r\nchildren continued to reside in Linn county, and a number of relations\r\nare still residents of this county.\r\n\r\nOne of the old settlers of Ivanhoe was Dr. S. Grafton, who arrived\r\nthere in 1843 and travelled horseback up and down the Cedar and Iowa\r\nriver valleys as far as Jones or as far northeast as half way to\r\nDubuque in the practice of his profession. He was born in Ohio in 1800,\r\nand died during the typhoid epidemic in 1845 and 1847. He was one of\r\nthe best known of the early physicians, a gentleman, a scholar, and a\r\nman who did, perhaps, more during the few years of his practice to help\r\nthe poor and the needy than any other of the early settlers. He was\r\nmarried to Isabelle Patterson, also a resident for many years of East\r\nLiverpool, Ohio, but born in Pennsylvania. After the death of Dr.\r\nGrafton she married Herman Boye, a son of Nels C. Boye. Mr. Boye was a\r\ncabinet maker and farmer. He got caught with the gold fever and\r\nemigrated to California in 1850, returning to Ivanhoe within a few\r\nyears. It is said that he made more money in California seining for\r\nfish, which he had learned in Denmark, than he did in digging gold. He\r\ndied in 1880 at the age of sixty-two years. The widow died January 11,\r\n1897, at the advanced age of eighty years, and is buried at Mount\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\nAnother of the old settlers of Bertram may be mentioned--Joseph Crane,\r\na cousin of James Doty, who has the honor, at least, of obtaining the\r\nfirst license to marry within the Territory, viz: in 1840 when he was\r\nmarried to Agnes Boghart.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers seem to have been William Abbe, Daniel Hahn, C. C.\r\nHaskins, and Edward M. Crow. Which one of these men actually was the\r\nfirst settler within the confines of the county may ever remain a\r\ndisputed question. We have the record when they entered lands, but this\r\ndoes not at all indicate that they did not live on these lands for\r\nseveral years before actual entry was made. The first settler in the\r\nvicinity of what became Mount Vernon was, no doubt, Charles Haskins,\r\nwho located about a mile and a half east of the village in the summer\r\nof 1837. He was at least one of the first to locate in that vicinity.\r\nIt is said that Daniel Hahn came in the spring of 1837, made a claim\r\nand built a log cabin, his wife assisting him in building the house.\r\nEdward M. Crow has been supposed to have been the first settler, but it\r\nseems that he came in July, 1837, in company with his brother, and\r\nlocated near what later became known as Viola, where he made a claim\r\nand erected a small shanty. He returned to the Fox river settlement for\r\nprovisions and did not come back until in August, when he was\r\naccompanied by his brother and by James Dawson. About this time also\r\ncame Joselyn and Russell. Their cabins were located in the back woods\r\nin Brown township and was called \"The Settlement\" for some time.\r\n\r\nLater in the fall of 1837 arrived Jacob Mann, having resided previously\r\nin Jones county. He located on what was known as \"Big Creek\" in Linn\r\ncounty, but he did not take possession of his rude cabin or claim until\r\nin February, 1838, when he and his daughter, Sarah, moved onto the\r\nclaim and began housekeeping. He afterward built a grist mill on Big\r\ncreek or purchased one built by John Oxley which was swept away in the\r\nspring of 1851, when Mann lost his life, refusing to leave his mill\r\nwhich, he said, \"was dearer to him than his own life.\"\r\n\r\nSally Mann is supposed to have been, if not the first white woman in\r\nthe county, at least one of the first, and many are the stories told of\r\nSally, or rather Sarah, Mann. She was more masculine than feminine in\r\nher make-up and knew few of the customs and manners of good society.\r\nShe raised cats for a living and used to sell these at fancy prices to\r\nthe pioneer settlers. There was nothing attractive about Sally, for she\r\nwas noted more for her strength and endurance than for grace and\r\nbeauty. But even though Sally had very little to recommend her, women\r\nwere scarce in those days and the settlers were, perhaps, not so\r\nparticular as they later became, and on July 21, 1840, Sally Mann and\r\nAaron Haynes were duly married by John Crow, a justice of the peace.\r\nSally Haynes nee Mann, had many good traits of character. No one was\r\nturned away from her door hungry and she would help neighbors with any\r\nkind of work if necessary. The western life appealed to her, as it had\r\nto the members of her family, and when settlers came thick and fast she\r\nand her husband left for the far west in order, it was said, that they\r\ncould breathe the pure air of the frontier. It was always thus.\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis not the fairest form that holds\r\n       The mildest, purest soul within;\r\n     'Tis not the richest plant that holds\r\n       The sweetest fragrance in.\"\r\n\r\nGabriel Carpenter, a native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was born in\r\n1801. He arrived in Cedar Rapids in 1852 and invested all his funds in\r\n500 acres of land in what has now become the heart of the city. Various\r\nadditions in this city have been named in honor of this early real\r\nestate owner, who devoted all his time in the upbuilding of this city\r\nuntil his death in 1881. Mr. Carpenter saw many hardships in his early\r\ncareer in life, but with great perseverance overcame all. The first\r\nlumber he used was hauled by oxen from Muscatine. He became early\r\ninterested in various enterprises in the city. He always gave liberally\r\nof his means to all worthy objects and assisted in advancing all public\r\nenterprises which he believed would prove a benefit to the city. His\r\nwidow, Mrs. Maria Carpenter, born in 1820, is still living and resides\r\nin this city, honored and respected by all.\r\n\r\nDr. S. D. Carpenter was born in 1826, and is a son of Gabriel\r\nCarpenter. In the early fifties he came to Cedar Rapids and located\r\nhere for the practice of medicine. He soon gave up medicine for the\r\nmore exciting and more lucrative vocation of railway building, banking,\r\nand handling of real estate. He now resides in Chicago.\r\n\r\nJohn E. Kurtz was born in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, in 1817,\r\nemigrated to Iowa in 1847, and became one of the founders of Lisbon. He\r\nwas for more than half a century a well known farmer, merchant, and\r\nmiller. In early life Mr. Kurtz was a whig in politics, later going\r\nover to the republican party. A large number of his descendants still\r\nreside in this county.\r\n\r\nPeter D. Harman was a native of Adams county, Pennsylvania, where he\r\nwas born in 1816. In 1840 he came to Iowa City, locating in Linn county\r\ntwo years later. Mr. Harman assisted in the building of the state\r\ncapitol at Iowa City, and also in the erection of the first court house\r\nin Linn county. In his day and generation Mr. Harman was considered one\r\nof the most skillful stone and brick masons in this part of the\r\ncountry. He died in Bertram township in 1896, and is survived by a\r\nnumber of children who are residents of this county.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT OLD SETTLERS' REUNION, MARION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PARK SCENE IN MARION]\r\n\r\nBarnett Lutz came to Linn county in 1839 and was one of the best known\r\nof the old settlers. At the time of his death in 1901 he was one of the\r\noldest pioneers in the county. Mr. Lutz was a true pioneer, and did\r\nmuch in building up the new country.\r\n\r\nC. J. Ives was not a pioneer settler in Linn county, but he was a\r\npioneer in developing railway properties in the state. Mr. Ives was a\r\nnative of New England, coming to Lee county in 1847, drifting into\r\nmining in Colorado, and not till 1862 did he turn his attention to\r\nrailroading. He was for a number of years president of the B., C. R. &\r\nN. railway, which he developed into one of the best paying railway\r\nproperties in the west. He resigned when that road was absorbed by the\r\nRock Island system. Mr. Ives during his long residence in Linn county\r\nwas deeply interested in the welfare of his employees, and in the\r\nupbuilding of Cedar Rapids. He was also interested in banks, electric\r\nlight companies, and other large enterprises. He was a practical\r\nbusiness man, capable and forceful, with a mind ever active in planning\r\nand executing great things. He was universally respected by his\r\nemployees, and never forgot in word, act, or deed that he was only an\r\nassociate and not a superior. No railway official at the time of his\r\ndeath a few years ago had more friends among the railroad men than Mr.\r\nIves.\r\n\r\nDavid W. King, the founder of Kingston, settled in Linn county in 1839\r\nwhen Indians were numerous and the white settlers scattered. Mr. King\r\nwas a native of Westmorland county, Pennsylvania, who went to Michigan\r\nearly and from there drove an ox team across the country to Iowa,\r\nentering land on the west side of the river, which land is now a part\r\nof Cedar Rapids. Mr. King operated the first ferry across the Cedar\r\nriver and had to obtain his material for the erection of the same from\r\nDubuque and Muscatine, all of which was hauled in wagons across the\r\ncountry. The cable used in operating the ferry was of wire, which was\r\nbrought from Dubuque on horseback. The town of Kingston he platted in\r\n1850. Mr. King was a real promoter, who early comprehended the future\r\nof Cedar Rapids. In order to induce people to locate on the west side\r\nof the river he was liberal and public-spirited, giving away many lots\r\nfor factory sites and other enterprises. He passed away in 1854 at the\r\nage of forty-six, just at a time when he had attained to a prominent\r\nplace as one of the leading citizens of the town, in the promotion of\r\nwhich he had devoted all his time and versatile talents.\r\n\r\nRobert Smyth, who died in 1898 at his home at Mount Vernon, was in many\r\nrespects one of the most enterprising men in Linn county. Born in\r\nIreland in 1814, and emigrating to America in 1834, he drifted into\r\nLinn county in 1840 and soon became an extensive dealer in real estate,\r\nas well as a banker, and during all his life took an active part in\r\npolitics. He was a member of the Sixth Territorial legislature in\r\n1843-44, a member of the state legislature in 1846-48. Mr. Smyth was\r\nalso paymaster of the United States army, disbursing more than\r\n$10,000,000.00 during his term of office. In 1868 he was once more\r\nreturned to the state senate where he served for four years, and in\r\n1884 served another term in the house. He was also delegate to many\r\nstate conventions, and outside of the late Charles Weare knew more of\r\nthe public men of Iowa than any other man in Linn county. Mr. Smyth was\r\na brother of William Smyth, the well known jurist, who died a member of\r\ncongress from this district.\r\n\r\nEdward M. Crow, by some people believed to be the first actual white\r\nsettler in the county, was born in Orange county, Indiana, in 1816 of\r\nancestors who had previously emigrated from North Carolina. John Crow,\r\nthe father, came to Linn county to the neighborhood of Viola in 1838,\r\nand there he died in March, 1841. It is thought that Ed Crow crossed\r\nthe Mississippi river in 1837 and on July 4th laid claim to a tract of\r\nland on section 13 in Brown township. Thus, it would seem, that Abbe\r\npreceded him by several months. In company with Crow at that time there\r\ncame Harrison Crow, a brother, as well as James Dawson, who built\r\ncabins on what is now known as Crow's creek near Viola. They also put\r\nup a little hay that fall. Thus, while these were among the first\r\nsettlers, it must be conceded that they did not precede Abbe, Haskins,\r\nor Hahn in locating in Linn county. Ed Crow, it is true, was one of the\r\nearly settlers and well known, a typical pioneer, but he was not the\r\nfirst settler, although he arrived in the historic year of 1837, when\r\nthe white settlers were beginning to move into the territory not yet\r\nvacated by the red men.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning the men who were factors in the upbuilding of Iowa,\r\nTheodore S. Parvin should not be omitted. During his residence in Linn\r\ncounty he devoted most of his time to the upbuilding of a unique\r\nMasonic library. He was known throughout the United States as one of\r\nthe leaders of that order. Mr. Parvin's love of collecting together\r\nmany things was only one of the many sidedness of a remarkable\r\npersonage. Mr. Parvin was born in Cedarville, New Jersey. Educated in\r\nthe east, he drifted west to Cincinnati and there met Robert Lucas,\r\nrecently appointed governor of Iowa Territory. Mr. Parvin had been a\r\nteacher and had been admitted to the bar so he was well qualified for\r\nhis mission as secretary to the governor. After coming to Burlington\r\nMr. Parvin was United States attorney, clerk of the federal court,\r\nregistrar of the state land office, and for many years professor and\r\nregent of the State University of Iowa. During all these years he\r\nlectured and wrote much. He died June 28, 1901, one of the most widely\r\nknown and most honored men in the state. \"Steadfast in faith, without\r\ntrace of cant, he walked the ways of life with simple trust in the\r\nInfinite wisdom and passed to his death relying on the guidance of an\r\nunseen hand,\" says his biographer.\r\n\r\nJulius E. Sanford was one of the platters of the city of Cedar Rapids,\r\nand was a wide-awake, enterprising young man who for a while was in\r\npartnership with N. W. Isbell. Mr. Sanford was a native of Connecticut\r\nand was well educated on coming west where he took up the practice of\r\nthe law and engaged in real estate. He removed to Dubuque in 1845,\r\nwhere he died in 1847, leaving a widow, Henrietta E. Sanford, who in\r\n1848 married David Wilson. She died in 1898. Perit Sanford, who figures\r\nin early real estate transfers, was the father of Julius Sanford, and\r\nheir of the estate, as the son died without children.\r\n\r\nThomas Craig was an old settler in Linn county, and one of the best\r\nknown men in the community. Mr. Craig was odd in some ways. He wore a\r\nwhite overcoat and had a fondness for horses. He was a stanch\r\nMethodist, and at times would be reprimanded, for he refused to lead in\r\nprayer. Mr. Craig died many years ago, respected and honored by all\r\nwith whom he had come in contact. One of his daughters was married to\r\nN. B. Brown and another to Jesse Beechly, who recently died in his old\r\nhomestead in Franklin township.\r\n\r\nDr. Eber L. Mansfield was born in Canaan, Ohio, in 1821. He received a\r\nclassical education and also took a medical course later. On leaving\r\nhome his father gave him a horse, saddle-bags, and an outfit, and he\r\nstarted out for himself. He taught school in Kentucky and then came\r\noverland on horseback to Iowa in 1847, crossing the Cedar river near\r\nthe lower bridge. He was assisted by W. W. and M. A. Higley, two young\r\nmen who later became his friends and fellow workers in the upbuilding\r\nof Cedar Rapids. The gold fever of 1850 took the doctor away from his\r\npractice, and by August, 1850, he had arrived at the gold diggings. On\r\nthe way he had made money, as he doctored a great many who were sick\r\nwith fevers. He purchased two teams and did teaming from Sacramento to\r\nShaw's Flats for about two years when he got tired and sold out,\r\nreturning by way of Panama and New Orleans. He came back to Cedar\r\nRapids, which city remained his home until his death. Dr. Mansfield was\r\none of the best known and most successful physicians of his day and\r\ngeneration. He invested in city real estate, in bank stock, and was\r\nstockholder in insurance companies. His was a rugged, strong character.\r\nHe early saw the possibilities of the city, and was one of the first to\r\ninvest in its real estate. He erected brick buildings in the heart of\r\nthe city which are now owned by his children, and are very valuable.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rogers, a native of Ohio, where he was born in 1830, came to\r\nLinn county and settled in Rogers Grove in the early forties. Mr.\r\nRogers was an enterprising man and was one of the first to erect a saw\r\nmill and to raft lumber down the river to Muscatine in order to find a\r\nmarket for it. In an age when straw sheds were common he went to work\r\nand erected one of the best and largest barns in the country. In this\r\nbarn he stacked his grain and threshed it by walking the horses over\r\nit, the wheat dropping through the floor to a floor below where it was\r\ncleaned. Mr. Rogers died many years ago, one of the best known men in\r\nsouthern Linn county. His widow, Elizabeth McNie, is still living,\r\nmaking her home with her son, James M. Rogers, of Fairfax township.\r\n\r\nChandler Jordan, born in 1820 in the state of Maine, came to Linn\r\ncounty in 1844, where he made his home until his death a short time\r\nago. Mr. Jordan was a lifelong member of the Baptist church, which he\r\nsupported and in which he was an active worker all his life. He was\r\ninterested in the public schools, and in public affairs in general.\r\nJordan's Grove is named in honor of this sturdy old pioneer.\r\n\r\nG. W. Matsell, for many years a resident of Buffalo township, where he\r\nowned some 2,000 acres of land which he purchased at an early day, was\r\na well known character in New York city in the old days of Tammany\r\nHall. He was chief of police and a prominent politician for many years\r\ntill the breaking up of the party with which he was closely associated.\r\nThen he came here where his family still resides. Mr. Matsell of course\r\nspent much time in New York, where he had financial interests, but he\r\nliked the west and enjoyed the summers in Iowa. He was a democrat of\r\nthe old school, but never entered into the game of politics after\r\ncoming west, having had his fill of it in the New York political ring\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nThe Matsell home was a hospitable one and many were the people George\r\nMatsell entertained during his residence in Iowa. Visitors came from\r\nall over the country, for he was well known. Mr. Matsell entertained\r\nroyally and knew how to entertain. The history of New York city cannot\r\nbe written without the mention of G. W. Matsell, police chief, a member\r\nof the Committee of Seventy, and a well known character for many years\r\nduring the stormy days of the Civil war. His son still resides on the\r\nold homestead.\r\n\r\nRobert Safely was a native of Scotland. He emigrated to New York at the\r\nage of fourteen. He saw the first engine to run with steam in the state\r\nof New York. For many years Mr. Safely was master mechanic for the old\r\nB., C. R. & N. system, and was a familiar figure on the streets of\r\nCedar Rapids up to the time of his death, a short time ago. Mr. Safely\r\nwas an expert mechanic and up to the time of his death was interested\r\nin everything pertaining to mechanical science.\r\n\r\nMany of our earlier citizens only remained here for a shorter or longer\r\ntime and left for other parts where they later attained to prominence.\r\nWho does not remember W. H. Ingham, one of Kossuth county's pioneers,\r\nwho lived in this county in 1850 and for five years was engaged in\r\nsurveying and locating lands for early settlers? Judge Thomas Burke, a\r\nnoted character of Seattle and now wealthy, tried his luck at the law\r\nhere waiting for clients who never came. When Mr. Burke was picked up\r\nby J. J. Hill on the coast then every one wanted this once briefless\r\nbarrister as his legal adviser. Bishop C. C. McCabe lived here for a\r\nnumber of years, and no one had any idea that the rollicky, fun-making,\r\njoking young beardless lad in the employ of Judge Greene and others\r\nwould develop into a great lecturer and a Methodist bishop. Dr. J. T.\r\nHeadley, of lecture fame, practiced medicine here in the late sixties,\r\nand was a quiet, unassuming man, who minded his own business and\r\ndevoted days and nights to books and science. Here lived for some years\r\nthe eloquent divine, Rev. Fawcett, a person of great eloquence and\r\nforce of character who left Cedar Rapids better for having lived in it.\r\nOne cannot forget Rev. Elias Skinner, now living in Waterloo, also a\r\nMethodist minister of force and eloquence who at various times lived in\r\nLinn county. Rev. Skinner, despite his eighty-three years, is well and\r\nhearty and can relate many things which occurred in this county in the\r\nfifties and sixties. He writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I think Linn county is about the very best county in Iowa.\r\n     Five different times I had my home in old Linn. I never did\r\n     anything worthy of special mention at either time. In each\r\n     of the four places where I lived I blundered into doing\r\n     things which I would rather not have recalled. So please\r\n     excuse me. I write with pencil because I can't guide a pen.\r\n\r\n                                  \"Yours,\r\n\r\n                                                E. SKINNER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOL. DURHAM TO THE OLD SETTLERS--ADDRESS BEFORE ASSOCIATION.\r\nAUGUST 1902\r\n\r\n_Ladies and Gentlemen of the Old Settlers' Society_: In calling this\r\nassemblage to order I wish to say to you all, to the new-comers, the\r\nstrangers who honor us with their presence, that, in the name of our\r\nsociety, we bid you a most hearty welcome and say as a good hostess\r\nwould, come again.\r\n\r\nMany of you I knew in territorial times, when we were seeking and\r\nestablishing new homes, in the far new country beyond the Mississippi,\r\nand aiding in our humble way to lay the foundation of the present\r\nfamous commonwealth of Iowa. The first settlements were made along and\r\nnear the Mississippi river. There were but two counties, Dubuque and\r\nDes Moines, and the country was called the Black Hawk Purchase. The\r\npurchase negotiated with the Sac and Fox Indians, by General Scott and\r\nGovernor Reynolds, at the close of the Black Hawk war, consisted of a\r\nstrip averaging about fifty miles wide, beginning in the northeastern\r\npart of the state and running to the north boundary of Missouri, though\r\nnot on a straight line, at a point fifty miles west of the river. It\r\nwas under the jurisdiction of the territory of Michigan, and was\r\nrepresented in congress, as a territorial delegate, by George Wallace\r\nJones.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 a few townships in the northwestern part of this county were\r\nsurveyed by a surveyor general deputy named Haight. And soon thereafter\r\nEdward Crow and a few other adventurers came. Their only roads were\r\nfragments of Indian trails. They were delighted with the country and\r\nthe smooth, polished surface of the unbroken prairie in all the\r\ngrandeur and sublimity of its primeval state. Sages have sung of the\r\ncharms seen in the face of such solitudes and I would say that I never\r\nfelt nearer the great Creator and Ruler of the universe than when in\r\nregions before untrod by civilized man, where the forces of nature\r\nreigned supreme, and no sounds broke the silence except the hoo-hooing\r\nof owls, the drumming of pheasants, the bugle notes of the swan, the\r\nquacking of smaller fowls, the barking of prairie wolves, and in a\r\ntimbered country, the hungry, desolate howl of the large wolf, and\r\nsometimes, though seldom, the piteous wail of the panther. It's no\r\nwonder that Moses retired to the top of a distant mountain with the\r\nroar of thunder and the flashes of lightning beneath him to talk with\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 another strip of country was acquired from the Indians,\r\nembracing the remainder of Linn county. Possession was given in 1839,\r\nwhen a continuous immigration commenced, which dates back to the coming\r\nof many of the families represented here today, our respected secretary\r\namong them, and not long after that our treasurer. Previous to its\r\norganization in 1839, Linn county was, with Jones county, attached for\r\njudicial, revenue, and election purposes to Jackson county. In 1838 the\r\nterritory of Iowa was struck off from Wisconsin, Robert Lucas was\r\nappointed governor by President Van Buren, and William Wallace Chapman\r\nwas elected first delegate to congress, with both of whom I was\r\nacquainted in the constitutional convention in 1844. Governor Lucas was\r\na Virginian by birth, though raised in Ohio, where he had served as\r\ngovernor. He was one of nature's noblemen, not for pomposity and fine\r\nequipage, but for all the traits that make up true manhood--modesty,\r\ncourage, honesty, integrity, patriotism, and morality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURT HOUSE, MARION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAPSIE RIVER AND MILL Built in the '50s at Central\r\nCity]\r\n\r\nSoon after the organization of the territory the Missouri war began.\r\nThis related to the boundary line between the two states. It lasted\r\nsome time, but like the Ohio and Michigan war, was bloodless, though a\r\ngood deal of patriotism and red tape and military titles were shed. The\r\ntrouble was finally settled by the surveyors and the courts.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Linn county was organized. The first officers were John C.\r\nBerry, commissioner's clerk or auditor; Hosea W. Gray, sheriff; Dr.\r\nTryon, clerk of the court; Luman W. Strong, Samuel C. Stewart, and\r\nPeter McRoberts, county commissioners. Squire Strong was a potential\r\nfactor in all Linn county affairs. Mr. Stewart was distinguished for\r\nhis piety. His wife was a sister of those sturdy pioneers, the Scott\r\nbrothers. In 1840 the territory contained 43,000 inhabitants; Augustus\r\nC. Dodge was elected delegate to congress, and George Greene a member\r\nof the territorial council, or senate, to represent Cedar, Linn, and\r\nJones counties. In 1841 the remainder of Linn county was surveyed by\r\nthe United States deputies, with all of whom I was acquainted and in\r\ntheir camps--but chiefly with Mr. Welden.\r\n\r\nAfter these surveys were made, claim-making and improving and trading\r\nbecame very lively, and the ratio of immigration increased all the\r\ntime. There was more disturbance and trouble and fighting about claims\r\nthan from all other causes put together. I will give only a few\r\ninstances of the many with which I am acquainted. A man by the name of\r\nWolcott, near Mount Vernon, had his claim entered. He reported it to\r\nthe claim association. They sent a committee of three men to the\r\nintruder and demanded that he should release and cancel his purchase,\r\nwhich he refused to do. Whereupon they procured a conveyance and told\r\nhim that he must go to Dubuque with them. Knowing the settler's law was\r\nagainst him, he made no further resistance, but went before the\r\nregister and receiver, cancelled his entry, and his money was returned\r\nto him. The matter came up shortly after that before the grand jury at\r\nMarion on the charge of coercion and kidnapping. Samuel Hunter, Sr., of\r\nHunter's Cross Roads, was one of the jury, Joseph Williams was judge,\r\nP. W. Earle, clerk, and Nathan Peddycord, of Yankee Grove, was another\r\njuryman, and I was foreman. William Abbe and Squire Waln of Mount\r\nVernon were witnesses. Robert Smith was secretary of the claim\r\nassociation and Oliver Day or Allison Willits president. No bill was\r\nfound and the matter stopped and never reached the supreme court.\r\n\r\nAnother claim case originated in the Dry Creek country, and came to a\r\nclimax in a rather exciting way. There were a number of us attending an\r\nIndian banquet and pow-wow at a place called Wick-i-up Hollow, near the\r\nCedar river, two or three miles south of the Oliphant and Ashlock\r\nneighborhood. The regular guests were seated in a semi-circle in the\r\nwick-i-up; we were only callers. The exercises consisted of short\r\ntalks, chants and choruses, each keeping time with a deer's bladder\r\ndried and filled with air and some buckshot in it to make it rattle,\r\nall accompanied with the music of a sort of home made fife. The banquet\r\nor dinner to follow was being cooked by the women. It consisted, as far\r\nas I could see, of dried venison, stewed dog meat, beans, and pancakes.\r\nBefore the dinner was ready some of our party went outside and renewed\r\na quarrel that had been pending for some time about their claims.\r\nPretty soon the lie was passed, and it was immediately followed by a\r\nblow, and directly five or six were in the fight all at once. The\r\nstruggle and angry shouts of the combatants frightened some of the\r\nIndian women who were near and they ran screaming away. This broke up\r\nthe exercise in the wick-i-up and the braves rushed out, thinking that\r\ntheir women were being misused, for a brave man will always resent an\r\ninsult to his wife. The fight so disrupted everything that we left\r\nwithout waiting for dinner, especially as some had to withdraw for\r\nrepairs. The Chambers were in it. William Garrison and some of the\r\nNations were in it, but not Carrie with her little hatchet. John Hunter\r\nand, I think, Dyer Usher, were there, but not in the fight. The case\r\ncame up before his honor, Aaron Usher, a justice of the peace, who\r\nfined some of the participants $1.00 each, which ended the litigation\r\nand the claim dispute.\r\n\r\nThe last claim case I will mention was of much greater magnitude, and\r\nout of it originated the Bill Johnson war, in which several lives were\r\nlost, including one Indian. It began in Buchanan county. William\r\nBennett and a man purporting to be Bill Johnson of the Canadian patriot\r\nwar were the principles in the extensive trouble. Bennett was an\r\nenterprising, public-spirited man and had a quantity of workmen and\r\nretainers helping build the first grist mill at Quasqueton, on the\r\nWapsipinicon river. He was a man of sturdy muscular frame, swarthy\r\ncomplexion, dark eyes, strong jaws, a man who would be a good friend or\r\na bad enemy. Johnson was older, tall and angular, with black bushy\r\nhair, on whose lips shone no smile, under whose brow lurked treason,\r\nstratagem, and spoil. I became acquainted with Johnson in a rather\r\nromantic way, which you will excuse me for relating, as it shows some\r\nof the perils and hardships incident to the settling of a new country.\r\nOn the 12th of November, 1842, a deep snow fell and remained till the\r\nnext April, with additions during the winter. It has always since been\r\ncalled the hard winter of 1842 and '43.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter my friend, Anderson Chambers, later a prosperous\r\nbusiness man of Muscatine, and I had been up in the country between the\r\nWapsipinicon and the Volga. The snow drifts were so deep and the day so\r\ndark that night overtook us several hours ride from any human\r\nhabitation. Before dark we went into a little scattering timber on a\r\nsmall stream and under the bluff hitched our horses to a bush. We found\r\nsome dry poles and got some dry rotten wood out of a tree, scraped away\r\nthe snow with our feet, and with the aid of a flint and some tow and\r\npowder, we managed to start a little fire. Matches were not then in\r\nuse. We cut some brush and laid it on the ground, spread one horse\r\nblanket on that to lie on, and with another to cover us and our saddles\r\nfor pillows, we slept through the long night until daylight, when we\r\nresumed our ride. About the middle of the forenoon we came in sight of\r\nan improvement in the edge of the timber, and I knew by the smoke that\r\nso gracefully curled that a frontiersman's log cabin was there. We went\r\ninto the house, which was neat and clean, and told them of our hard\r\nexperience during the preceding night and day. They kindly sympathized\r\nwith us and soon made us comfortable. It proved to be Bill Johnson's\r\nplace. Kate Johnson and another young lady, Miss Kelso of Davenport,\r\nwere there. They busied themselves about setting us up a fresh, warm,\r\nten o'clock breakfast. I relished it more than any other breakfast I\r\never ate, the zest of which was no doubt heightened by being served by\r\nso charming a hostess, and me a susceptible bachelor, too.\r\n\r\nJohnson explained his being there in this wild region by saying that he\r\nhad participated actively in the Canadian patriot war against the\r\nDominion of Canada, that the attempted revolution had failed, that he\r\nhad lost all his property by it, and had been driven and chased all\r\nthrough and among the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence river in his\r\nboat with his daughter Kate, that a reward had been offered for him,\r\nthat he had given up all hope of success and determined to seek safety\r\nand quietude by coming to this country. All this seemed plausible, as I\r\nheard the brave deeds of the patriots rehearsed in song and poetry. But\r\nin escaping that trouble he ran into the jaws of another at the outset.\r\nIt seemed that in coming into a strange neighborhood, instead of making\r\nthe people his friends by conciliation and prudent conduct, he got into\r\ntrouble at the start by taking possession of the claim of one of the\r\nBennett party. They remonstrated and he promised to pay for the claim,\r\nbut never did, though Johnson claimed that the trouble was about the\r\nlocation of the county seat. Not long after I was at his place, after\r\ngiving him notice, they determined to oust him. They took him out in\r\nthe brush and gave him a very severe flogging, loaded him and all his\r\nbelongings into sleds and sent him out of the country. He applied for\r\naid at Marion and Dubuque, and Surveyor General Wilson, a New Hampshire\r\nman, took him and his daughter Kate to Iowa City, in his fine Boston\r\nmade sleigh, to interest Governor Chambers in his behalf. When the\r\nhostilities came to an end, the result was disastrous to both parties.\r\nBennett became a fugitive and his mill building was stopped. Johnson\r\nwas shot. Kate found her a loving, trusting husband. Hosea Gray made\r\nconsiderable money out of it; Ormus Clark, the first permanent settler\r\nof Central City, spent a lot of money for defense, and Colonel Preston\r\nlaid the foundation of his splendid fame and fortune as an attorney\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe public land sales had been advertised for this winter and the\r\npeople were illy prepared to go to Dubuque to enter their claims on\r\naccount of the deep snow, some for scarcity of clothing, and all for\r\nscarcity of money. Many had saved their last 12-1/2 and 6-1/2 cent\r\nsilver coins and their 5-franc pieces to make up the necessary sums. In\r\nview of the difficulties in the way, a mass meeting was held, and\r\nGeorge Greene was appointed a special agent to go to Washington City\r\nfor the purpose of having the land office removed to Marion. He went\r\nand saw the commissioner of public lands; he saw Stephen A. Douglas,\r\nchairman of the committee on public lands, and President Tyler, and\r\ncame back with an order for the temporary removal in his pocket, which\r\nI doubt if any other man could have done. He stood luminous among all\r\nthe bright men who first settled in Linn county, or the territory\r\neither. The people of Linn county, and of Cedar Rapids especially,\r\nshould ever remember his labors and efforts in those early days which\r\nbrought them prominence and prosperity. All now acknowledge Linn county\r\nto be without a peer and Cedar Rapids is the best interior city in the\r\nstate, except Des Moines with its immense coal beds.\r\n\r\nThe land office was located in the first, and then only brick house in\r\nMarion. Judge Berry afterwards dispensed boundless hospitality in it.\r\nIt was built and owned by William H. Woodbridge, or \"Democ Woodbridge,\"\r\na very enterprising young man. He was one of five from this county who\r\nenlisted in the Mexican war. He was with Scott's army of invasion and\r\nthe Mexicans \"welcomed him with bloody hands to a hospitable grave.\"\r\nAnother of the five, Major McKean, as he was then known, who was a\r\nmember of the first constitutional convention in 1844, and later a\r\nbrigadier general in the union army, lies buried in the Marion\r\ncemetery. Another of the five, Captain Sausman, who gallantly bore the\r\nflag at Chepultepec, died in California. Captain Gray is alone, and\r\nalive and likely to be, as you would think if you could see him running\r\nan intricate surveyor's line through a section. The fifth one, Samuel\r\nD. Thompson, is with us amply provided for in his declining years by a\r\nmunificent government, in recognition of his military service in nearly\r\nall the wars since the time of Anthony Wayne, and as the old song says:\r\n\r\n     \"There is no more work for brave old Joe.\r\n     He's gone to the place where all good soldiers go.\"\r\n\r\nThe land sales drew large numbers from all the surrounding country, and\r\nmade lively times here. Joseph F. Chapman and Oliver S. Hall, Sr.,\r\nhotel keepers, flourished. Those who had the money got titles to their\r\nlands, and those who had not still held their claims until such time as\r\nthey could enter them at private sale. In the spring the land office\r\nwas moved back to Dubuque.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the first constitutional convention was held at Iowa City. The\r\nconstitution failed of ratification. In 1846 another convention was\r\nheld and the state fully admitted under that with our present\r\nboundaries. Iowa was then the most western state, and a line drawn\r\nsouth from Sioux City, its western limit, would have run further west\r\nthan any other state or territory, except Texas, which was annexed the\r\nyear before. It now occupies a conspicuous central position in the\r\nAmerican union, and a leading one in agricultural productions. It is\r\nhonored with two members of the president's cabinet and the most\r\ninfluential member of the American senate.\r\n\r\nAfter our acquisition of California the waves of emigration westward\r\nbegan, sweeping over the great American desert, as it had been called,\r\nplanting agriculture and industry in its path, forcing its way through\r\nthe mountain passes and over the sun-dried plains, to the Pacific ocean\r\nat the Golden Gate, where floats the commerce of oriental Asia.\r\n\r\n     \"No pent up Utica contracts our powers;\r\n     The whole of this boundless domain is ours.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I look in the faces of this multitude I see before me but few who\r\nwere men and women grown when I first came here. Some of you\r\ngray-haired ladies and gentlemen were then, as the Indians called them,\r\npetite squaws or skinneways. Your fathers were Niseshin Shomoko men.\r\nBut I think scarcely more than a dozen are now living in this county\r\nwho were then men and women. And\r\n\r\n     \"I feel like one who treads alone\r\n       A banquet hall deserted,\r\n     Whose music is hushed, whose guests are gone,\r\n       And all but me departed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISAAC BUTLER Pioneer Resident of Springville]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_Early Linn County Lawyers and Courts_\r\n\r\nBY JUDGE MILO P. SMITH\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the judiciary of this county, as well as of the entire\r\ncountry, was quite different from what it now is. There were but two\r\nterms of court in a county, and Linn being a large county, terms here\r\nlasted about two or three weeks. In the smaller counties, one week or\r\nless was sufficient for the transaction of all the business. The grand\r\njury was composed of fifteen men instead of five or seven, as at\r\npresent, and twelve out of the fifteen had to concur in order to find a\r\nbill of indictment. At present the concurrence of a less number than\r\nthe whole is sufficient. The members of the grand jury selected their\r\nown clerk from their own number. They had no authority to act on the\r\nminutes of the examining magistrate, but it was obligatory on them to\r\nhave the witnesses before them, and to examine them personally.\r\n\r\nThere was no official shorthand reporter to take down the evidence on\r\nthe trial of cases in court. If the attorneys desired to perpetuate the\r\ntestimony, or any part of it, they either wrote it down in long hand\r\nthemselves, or selected some outside person to do it; generally some\r\nyoung lawyer. And sometimes the judge would make the only minutes of\r\nthe trial that were kept. From these imperfect notes, however taken,\r\nthe judge was required to determine what should go to the supreme court\r\nwhen he came to settle the bill of exceptions: no easy task. When court\r\nopened on the first day of the term--which was done with great\r\noutcry--the judge at once empaneled the grand jury, and then proceeded\r\nto make what was called a \"preliminary\" call of the calendar, at which\r\ncases that were not for trial were dismissed, continued, marked\r\nsettled, or otherwise disposed of. When that call was completed, he\r\nthen made the \"peremptory\" call, and all cases that were for trial were\r\nthen disposed of as they were reached. There was no assignment of cases\r\nfor trial as now practiced, but the lawyers had to be ready in each\r\ncase when reached.\r\n\r\nCourt week was generally regarded by the people as a sort of a picnic\r\nor holiday, and they came in from the country for several miles around\r\nto hear the lawyers spar with each other, and catch the \"rulings of the\r\ncourt.\" The court room was generally packed with listeners. Then\r\npolitical meetings were generally held during that week when everybody\r\nwas there and lawyers ready to do the speaking; and they furnished fine\r\nentertainments indeed.\r\n\r\nThe bar of Linn county in the early fifties was an unusually strong\r\none, said by some to be the strongest in the state. There were Judge N.\r\nW. Isbell, Judge Isaac Cook, Judge George Greene, Judge William Smyth,\r\nand Col. I. M. Preston. A little in the rear of the above worthies were\r\nN. M. Hubbard, R. D. Stephens, Wm. G. Thompson, J. H. Young, Thomas\r\nCorbett, and J. W. Dudley. Except Judge Greene and J. W. Dudley, all of\r\nthese persons lived in Marion.\r\n\r\nN. W. Isbell, the first county judge in this county, was selected by\r\nthe legislature in 1855 as a member of the supreme court, and filled\r\nthe position with honor and credit to himself and the state for several\r\nyears, and was afterwards appointed judge of the district court during\r\nthe Civil war, but resigned both positions on account of ill health. He\r\nwas a very learned man and a profound lawyer. He greatly enjoyed the\r\ninvestigation of legal questions, possessed an acute and analytical\r\nmind, and one richly stored with the results of historical and general\r\nreading. In the practice he was not partial to jury trials, much\r\npreferring the presentation of legal questions to the court. He had\r\nquite an aptitude for affairs, and became successful as an enterprising\r\nrailroad builder, projecting the old \"Air Line\" Railroad, the pioneer\r\nof the present route of the C., M. & St. P. Railway across the state.\r\nHe left a comfortable estate to his family, dying about the year 1865.\r\nHe was of small stature and insignificant in appearance, but with a\r\nlarge head, though small features. Indeed he very much resembled the\r\nHon. Wm. H. Seward in face, head, and stature. He was rather of an\r\nirascible temperament and consequently easily thrown off his\r\nbalance--but no member of the bar was more highly respected than was\r\nJudge Isbell for uprightness, honesty of purpose, general intelligence,\r\ndeep reading in general literature as well as in the law; and his\r\nblameless life made him a beloved citizen.\r\n\r\nI omit further mention of Judge Greene as there is elsewhere in this\r\nwork a lengthy sketch of him.\r\n\r\nIsaac Cook was born and raised in eastern Pennsylvania and became the\r\npossessor of a sound education as a basis for the legal studies he\r\nafterward pursued. He served quite a while on the district bench, and\r\nwas there noted for the care, time, and fairness he devoted to the\r\ncases he was called on to hear and decide. His mind was not so quick or\r\nrapid in its movements as some others, but it was very accurate in its\r\nconclusions. He was a fine chancery and corporation lawyer, and no\r\nbetter pleader ever drew a petition than Judge Cook. He was for many\r\nyears toward the close of his life general counsel for the predecessors\r\nof the C. & N. W. Railway Company and the Iowa Railroad Land Company in\r\nthe state of Iowa. Though he had an office first in Marion and then in\r\nCedar Rapids, he always lived on his farm just south of the former\r\nplace, in a plain, comfortable brick house. He was a broad shouldered,\r\nstock-built man of a dark complexion, and chewed an immense quantity of\r\ntobacco. He had, we believe, more practice in the supreme court of the\r\nUnited States than any other lawyer in Iowa in his day.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smyth, first county attorney of Linn county, was appointed\r\njudge of the district court to succeed Judge J. P. Carleton about the\r\nyear 1854, when he was but thirty years of age. He was regarded as an\r\nideal judge. He was of Scotch-Irish descent, and had received a\r\nthorough education when young. His education was perhaps more thorough\r\nthan broad, owing no doubt to his early surroundings. His legal lore\r\nwas as near exact and profound as was possible, and covered completely\r\nthe whole circle of legal learning. One who knew him well said, that in\r\ncommercial law, the law of real estate, and in pleading, he had no\r\nsuperiors and but few equals in the state. He was a trial lawyer in the\r\nfullest sense of that term. Careful in the preparation of his cases,\r\nmethodical in the introduction of his testimony; and in his\r\npresentation of his client's cause to a jury, his arguments were close\r\nand convincing, logical if not eloquent. He was, perhaps, after his\r\nretirement from the district bench, generally regarded as the head of\r\nthe bar of the county. His knowledge of the affairs of the nation, and\r\nthe principles of our government was most exact and comprehensive. For\r\nwealth of general information, profundity of legal learning, and\r\nurbanity of manner and dignity of deportment, he was not surpassed by\r\nany man in the state. Indeed he was early recognized as one of the\r\nleaders in affairs as well as of the bar of the state. He and the firm\r\nof which he was a member had the largest practice and the best\r\nclientage in the county. His practice extended to many of the\r\nneighboring counties, such as Benton, Tama, and Iowa, where he had\r\nlocal partners, and where he attended the terms of court. He was a\r\nvaluable member of the committee that revised the laws of the state as\r\nembodied in the Revision of 1860. He was offered a place on the supreme\r\ncourt bench but declined it. He was a delegate to the Republican\r\nNational Convention at Chicago in 1860--having been a democrat before\r\nthe slavery question gave rise to the republican party, he naturally\r\nsided with Governor Chase, whose political path led in the same\r\ndirection as his own, and gave that statesman his earnest and\r\npersistent support in the convention, voting for him to the last as his\r\nchoice for president. He was a formidable competitor of Governor James\r\nW. Grimes when the latter was elected to the United States senate in\r\n1858. In 1868 he was elected to congress from this district and died\r\nwhile such member in 1870, at the early age of forty-six. Of all that\r\ngoes to make up a first rate man and citizen--intelligence, ability,\r\nindustry, perseverance, honesty, and morality, he was in full\r\npossession, and enjoyed the confidence of the people to a greater\r\ndegree than any other citizen in the county. He was patriotic and brave\r\nand served during the war of the rebellion as colonel of an Iowa\r\nregiment, and while so serving, he contracted the disease that caused\r\nhis early death. He was the fortunate possessor of a splendid frame,\r\nbeing nearly six feet in height, and had a large, well formed head--his\r\ncarriage erect and movements stately and deliberate. He was a model\r\nchristian gentleman, courtly and polite, with a winning personality. He\r\ntoo was a man of affairs and left a comfortable estate to his family.\r\n\r\nColonel I. M. Preston, born in 1813, was in many respects a remarkable\r\nman. Thrown on his own resources when quite young, he learned the trade\r\nof carpenter and joiner, but read law while working at his trade, was\r\nadmitted when about thirty years of age, came to Marion, opened an\r\noffice, and at once took a position in the front rank of trial lawyers.\r\nHe was particularly successful as a criminal lawyer. He possessed a\r\nvery quick, subtle, and keen mind, and was remarkably resourceful in\r\nexpedients in the trial of cases. Some lawyers were better pleaders\r\nothers more learned in the law, but none more apt in furnishing the\r\nfacts to fit the case, and but few, if any, excelled him in marshalling\r\nthose facts in his presentation to the jury. In time he acquired great\r\nfame throughout the state as a lawyer and public speaker. He was early\r\nappointed district attorney for the district in which he lived, and in\r\n1846 was commissioned by Governor Clark colonel of an Iowa regiment of\r\nmilitia. He also served as county judge of Linn county, and at\r\ndifferent times served in both branches of the legislature. He was the\r\nfather of Judge J. H. Preston and E. C. Preston, both members of the\r\nbar, and residents of the city of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nN. M. Hubbard, later known as Judge Hubbard, was certainly the most\r\nbrilliant and noted lawyer that ever lived in or graced the bar of this\r\ncounty. He was appointed in 1865 judge of the district court, and\r\nserved till January 1, 1867. With a mind keen, bright and luminous, a\r\nsound understanding, a rich store of observation, an unparalleled\r\ncommand of language, a readiness in repartee, and unlimited power of\r\ninvective, he was unsurpassed by any man in the state, and by but few\r\nin the nation. He was for thirty years general attorney for the C. & N.\r\nW. Railway Company in Iowa, and upon his death left a generous estate.\r\n\r\nHubbard's early partner, R. D. Stephens, while a good lawyer, was\r\ncertainly a past master in finance, and was better known as a banker\r\nthan lawyer. He established the First National Bank at Marion, and the\r\nMerchants National Bank in Cedar Rapids. He died several years ago,\r\nquite wealthy. Both Hubbard and Stephens came to Linn county from the\r\nstate of New York in 1854. In the political campaign of 1856, Hubbard\r\nedited the _Linn County Register_, predecessor to the _Marion\r\nRegister_.\r\n\r\nMajor J. B. Young was probably the possessor of the best education of\r\nany of the lawyers of his time, and was a well read lawyer, a strong\r\nadvocate, careful and painstaking, but unfortunately possessed an\r\nirritableness and quickness of temper that was not calculated to\r\nadvance the cause of his client in a law suit. He died when\r\ncomparatively young, when on his way home from California where he had\r\ngone on account of his failing health.\r\n\r\nW. G. Thompson, better known as Major Thompson or Judge Thompson, still\r\nresides here at the ripe old age of eighty-one. But few of the present\r\ngeneration know all there is about Judge Thompson. Born and reared in\r\nthe state of Pennsylvania of Scotch parentage, with a fair academical\r\neducation, admitted to the bar when a little past twenty-one, he came\r\nto Linn county in 1853, and at once leaped into prominence as a lawyer\r\nand politician. In quickness of mind, versatility in extremity,\r\nreadiness of retort, flashings of wit, volubility of speech, touches of\r\npathos, flights of eloquence, and geniality of disposition, and\r\npopularity with the masses, he had no superior in eastern Iowa, if he\r\nhad an equal. It has been said of him that he could sit down to a trial\r\ntable in a case of which he had never before heard, and try it just as\r\nwell as though he had had months of preparation. He has been county\r\nattorney, state senator, presidential elector, major of the Twentieth\r\nIowa Volunteer Infantry, district attorney, chief justice of Idaho,\r\nmember of the legislature, member of congress, and judge of the\r\ndistrict court. And in filling all of these positions, he has served\r\nthe people faithfully and well. And in private life and as a\r\npractitioner he has surely been \"a man without a model and without a\r\nshadow.\"\r\n\r\nJ. W. Dudley lived in Cedar Rapids as Thomas Corbett did in Marion.\r\nThey were both careful, pains-taking, and judicious lawyers, not\r\nparticularly noted in any special respect, but safe, sound, and\r\ntrustworthy. They have both been long since dead.\r\n\r\nJ. J. Child and I. N. Whittam were also members of the bar in the early\r\n'50s. They both lived in Cedar Rapids. Judge Whittam was noted for his\r\nindustry, care and patience in regard to any matter in which he became\r\nengaged. He did not claim to be a man of mark or a great lawyer, but\r\ncertainly acquired and retained the confidence as an advisor of many of\r\nthe best citizens in Cedar Rapids and vicinity.\r\n\r\nJ. J. Child, long since dead, was said by those who knew him best to be\r\none of the best lawyers in the state. Though not an advocate, his\r\nlearning in law was wide and deep, and no client ever made a mistake in\r\nfollowing his advice. Unfortunately his habits of life seriously\r\nimpeded the good results that could have flowed from such a prolific\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nAfter these, came others to fill their places, but the most of them are\r\nhere now, and have received special reference and personal mention in\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\nThe entire state in 1857 was divided into twelve judicial districts,\r\nwith one judge in each district. Accompanying the act was the\r\nconstitutional provision that new districts could not be created\r\noftener than one new district in four years. Within about ten years the\r\nbusiness in court became so congested that relief was necessary and was\r\nsought in all directions. Finally, in 1868, the legislature passed a\r\ncircuit court bill, which by its terms divided every district into two\r\ncircuits and provided a judge for each circuit. The circuit court had\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction with the district court in all cases at law and\r\nin equity, and sole jurisdiction in probate matters and in appeals from\r\njustices of the peace, but it did not have jurisdiction in criminal\r\ncases. The same legislature abolished the county court that formerly\r\nhad jurisdiction of probate matters. In further defining the duties and\r\npowers of this court, the law created what was called a general term,\r\nto which all appeals from, and application for the correction of errors\r\nby the district and circuit courts would lie. The personnel of that\r\ncourt consisted of the judge of the district and the two circuit\r\njudges, and it sat twice a year. In this district one of the sessions\r\nwas held in Marion and the other in Iowa City. The district comprised\r\nthe counties of Jones, Cedar, Linn, Johnson, Benton, Iowa, and Tama.\r\nThe first three counties constituted one circuit, and the latter four\r\nthe other one. The limitation of the right to appeal when the amount in\r\ncontroversy was less than one hundred dollars was then passed. An\r\nappeal finally lay from the decision to the general term of the supreme\r\ncourt. When a case was decided at the general term, the judge to whom\r\nit was referred for a decision wrote out the decision in an opinion as\r\nthe supreme court judges do, but the opinions were not reported in the\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUBLIC SCHOOL AT SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\nThe next legislature materially changed the law. It abolished the\r\ngeneral term and consolidated the two circuits, cutting out one of the\r\njudges--each court retaining the jurisdiction it had--and provided for\r\nappeals directly to the supreme court.\r\n\r\nThen in 1886, the constitution of the state was radically changed by a\r\nvote of the people so that the limitation on the number of judicial\r\ndistricts and number of judges was removed. The circuit court was\r\nabolished, the office of district attorney was abolished, and that of\r\ncounty attorney created. There was a prosecuting attorney for each\r\ndistrict before. The legislature then created as many districts as was\r\nthought necessary, and as many judges to a district as were deemed\r\nsufficient to transact the business. This law is still in force. This\r\nbecame the new eighteenth judicial district, composed of the counties\r\nof Linn, Cedar, and Jones, with three judges.\r\n\r\nThe first district judge for Linn county after the adoption of the new\r\nconstitution in 1857, was Hon. William E. Miller, of Iowa City, and\r\nIsaac L. Allen, of Toledo, was elected district attorney--this in 1858.\r\nAllen was afterwards attorney general of the state.\r\n\r\nJudge Miller was well equipped for the position. With a thorough common\r\nschool education, and having been a practical machinist when young, and\r\nwith strong common sense, he had a naturally good judicial mind that\r\nhad been improved by careful study and years of practice in the law. He\r\ncame to the bench an intelligent, fair, and courteous judge. He\r\nresigned in 1862 and entered the Union army as colonel of the\r\nTwenty-eighth Iowa Volunteer Infantry. He afterwards served as circuit\r\njudge and finally as supreme judge of the state. From the resignation\r\nof Judge Miller till January 1, 1867, the district bench was graced in\r\nits occupancy by Judge N. W. Isbell, C. H. Conklin, and N. M. Hubbard.\r\n\r\nJudge Miller was a broad-shouldered, short, squatty fellow, and though\r\na good lawyer and jurist, he was an indifferent advocate, and not\r\nparticularly strong as a trial lawyer.\r\n\r\nJudge Conklin was probably the most scholarly, accomplished and\r\nprofound lawyer that ever sat on the district bench in this part of the\r\nstate. His home was in Vinton, and while he lived among the people\r\nthere he did not seem to be of them. He was a strong, tall, raw-boned\r\nman, always carefully dressed, with a most marked intellectual face,\r\nand he was certainly one of the most eloquent advocates that ever stood\r\nbefore a jury in eastern Iowa.\r\n\r\nJudge James H. Rothrock, of Tipton, was elected judge in 1866, and\r\nserved on the district bench till in February, 1876, when he was, by\r\nthe governor, appointed to a seat on the supreme bench, which position\r\nhe filled for over twenty years, when he voluntarily declined a further\r\nrenomination. He, too, entered the Union army in 1862 as lieutenant\r\ncolonel of the Thirty-fifth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, and served with\r\ncredit till sickness compelled him to resign and come home. Judge\r\nRothrock was not a learned man in the sense of having a college\r\neducation or having possessed an extensive breadth of general reading\r\nin history or science, nor was he fluent of speech, or particularly\r\nadroit as a practitioner, but he possessed naturally good judgment, a\r\nmost thorough common English education, a good knowledge of the law and\r\nits basic principles, a sound understanding, with an innate sense of\r\njustice. He was patient and even tempered, dignified, and kind. He made\r\na splendid _nisi prius_ judge. His opinions were always plain, couched\r\nin good strong Anglo-Saxon, terse and sound, and will long bear the\r\nclose and sharp criticism of posterity. Whenever he announced a\r\nprinciple of law, it was accepted without dispute as the law on the\r\npoint involved. Judge Rothrock was a large man of fine physique,\r\nimpressible presence, and very genial when off the bench.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John Shane, of Vinton, succeeded Judge Rothrock on the bench\r\nof this district in 1876 and served till 1882, when he resigned on\r\naccount of ill health. He possessed a much better education than did\r\nJudge Rothrock, and the scope of his general reading was not only\r\nbroad, but judiciously directed. He loved the law for the very sake of\r\nit and never tired of investigating its ofttimes hidden mysteries. He\r\nwas well liked as a judge, was convivial and sociable to a degree.\r\n\r\nThe judges who have filled the position on the district bench since\r\nJudge Shane's retirement are many and able, but can scarcely be said to\r\nbelong to the olden time.\r\n\r\nOf the few circuit judges that held court in this county, we can say\r\nthat they graced the position they filled with ease, but they belong\r\nrather to the present time than to the past age. But Judges Yates,\r\nMcKean, and Hedges will long be remembered by the older inhabitants as\r\ncapable, learned, and upright judges.\r\n\r\nIn the palmy days of the lawyers and judges described, the law\r\nlibraries were meagre and the books few. There are probably now a dozen\r\nlaw libraries in the county, any one of which contains more books than\r\nwere in the county in 1860, and there are some that contain twice or\r\nthree times as many. The practicing attorney was then thrown more upon\r\nhis own resources, and compelled to depend more on his own power of\r\nanalysis and discrimination than at the present time, which doubtless\r\nmade them stronger, more self-reliant, and resourceful. And the judges\r\nwere called upon to decide rather how the law should be than how it had\r\nbeen pronounced to be by some other tribunal, which was no doubt\r\nstrengthening to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_Chatty Mention of Bench and Bar_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of any community is not complete without a sketch of the\r\nmembers of the bar, for in the Temple of Justice every phase of human\r\nlife is seen. \"Here one hears the cry for vengeance and also the kind\r\npleadings for mercy.\" The members of the bar, especially in the early\r\nday, understood public opinion and discovered what men truly were and\r\nnot what they were reputed to be. At this early day the lawyers were\r\nthe tribunes of the people. They were men of brilliant intellect and of\r\nintense passions, and in trials which created universal interest in the\r\nsparsely settled community they swayed the minds and hearts of their\r\nhearers in a remarkable degree. It was an age of oratory, and Linn\r\ncounty in that day had its quota of brilliant intellects who remained\r\nhere for a shorter or longer period of time and in no small degree\r\nassisted in the upbuilding of the county and the state.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this sketch as brief as possible, and in an endeavor\r\nto picture the men as they were, we shall attempt to give a little of\r\nthe humorous side of their characters and follow in the footsteps of\r\nChanning who said \"anecdotes are worth pages of biographies.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the early members of the bar were men of education and\r\nrefinement, possessing a snappy humor that set courts and juries\r\nroaring. Many a long day's trial was brightened by some sally of native\r\nwit fresh from the frontier. These men were active in politics, were\r\npromoters of steamboat lines, stage companies, and paper railroads,\r\nwho, in course of time, became legislatures, judges, and financiers.\r\nThey all labored for the upbuilding of the infant state, where they had\r\ninvested all their surplus means, having faith in Iowa's future. In\r\nevery way possible they tried to upbuild its infant industries.\r\n\r\nLinn county was set off by act of legislature in 1837, while Iowa was\r\nthen a part of Wisconsin Territory. In August Governor Lucas set off\r\nJohnson, Cedar, Jones and Linn counties in one legislative district.\r\nThe attorneys from Linn county who appeared at Iowa City at the July\r\nterm, A. D. 1847, were Isaac M. Preston, John David and William Smythe,\r\nall of whom became noted lawyers before that body later. The judges on\r\nthe bench at this time were three well known Iowa jurists: Williams,\r\nWilson, and Kinney.\r\n\r\nThe first court was held at Marion October 26, 1840, presided over by\r\nJoseph Williams, who had been appointed to the judgeship July 25, 1838.\r\nAt this term of court, according to the records, there were present\r\nDistrict Attorney W. G. Woodward for the federal government, R. P.\r\nLowe, prosecuting attorney, H. W. Gray, sheriff, T. H. Tryon, clerk,\r\nand L. Mallory, marshal of the district. On the first grand jury sat\r\nIsrael Mitchell, founder of Westport, who had been appointed probate\r\njudge on January 16 of the previous year. The first justices in the\r\ncounty were: H. B. Burnap, John G. Cole, John M. Afferty, John Crow,\r\nWilliam Abbe, and Israel Mitchell. Some of the first county judges\r\nwere: Norman Isbell, Dan Lothian, J. Elliott, A. H. Dumont, and J. M.\r\nBerry.\r\n\r\nDuring these early days there were two terms of court, one in January,\r\nand the other in June. The cases brought involved small amounts, but\r\nfor the number of inhabitants of the county there was a great deal more\r\nlitigation then than now. Some of the early lawyers in Marion and Cedar\r\nRapids were: I. M. Preston, J. E. Sanford, N. W. Isbell, Isaac Cook,\r\nHenry Harman, William Smyth, J. J. Child, Joe B. Young, Dan Lothian,\r\nC. M. Hollis, J. David. N. M. Hubbard, R. D. Stephens, Tom Corbett,\r\nGeorge Greene, Israel Mitchell, D. O. Finch, A. S. Belt, John Mitchell,\r\nG. A. Gray, and C. L. Murray.\r\n\r\nAmong the attorneys in practice during the early '50s in Cedar Rapids\r\nwere the following: Henry Lehman, E. M. Bates, C. V. Tousley, J. J.\r\nChild, R. G. Welcher, D. M. McIntosh, T. J. Dudley, Jr., A. Sidney\r\nBelt, and Dan O. Finch, the latter being also editor of the\r\n_Progressive Era_. In 1861 came J. Munger and N. R. Graham, and during\r\nthe next year Edward Stark, who formed a partnership with A. S. Belt.\r\nIn 1862 came W. A. Dodge. During the early '60s George Greene and I. M.\r\nPreston were in partnership, Greene having an office in Cedar Rapids\r\nand Preston in Marion. Hubbard and Stephens were in partnership in\r\nMarion in the early '60s, Stephens running the law business while\r\nHubbard went to \"the front.\"\r\n\r\nThe attorneys locating here in the '50s and '60s were engaged in\r\nrailway promotion, in politics, and in booming towns, although they did\r\nnot neglect banking and fire insurance. There were towns which had two\r\nor three lawyers in the early day which have none now, which would\r\nindicate that litigation in the early days was more profitable than\r\nlater. In conversation with a number of the old lawyers this has been\r\ntold, that the land business was the best paying law business during\r\nthe pioneer days. It is also stated that much of the litigation in the\r\nearly days was to defend horse thieves and other criminals. How true\r\nthis is the writer does not know.\r\n\r\nIn the early days there was a class of people called \"Terrorists\"\r\ncausing the settlers much annoyance and trouble. They were a band of\r\nlooters who came along to scare people by reporting threatened Indian\r\nattacks, and when the settlers had fled to a place of safety others of\r\nthe band came along and looted the abandoned houses. The \"Copperhead\"\r\nmovement also extended into this county during the early period of the\r\nwar, and more or less litigation grew out of this excitement.\r\n\r\nAmong some of the well known lawyers of the pioneer days of this county\r\nwho have played a more or less prominent part at the bar, in politics,\r\nand otherwise, may be mentioned John David and J. E. Sanford, who came\r\nto Iowa in 1840. They were both bright men and had an exceptionally\r\nlarge practice in land titles. Any examiner of abstracts in this county\r\nwill find Sanford's name frequently as holding much of this land, also\r\nthat of H. W. Sanford, a relative. Thomas Corbett came from the east in\r\nan early day, was one of the characters at Marion, and became a well\r\nknown attorney, removing from Iowa in a short time on account of his\r\nhealth. He became a hero soon after he married a well known lady in\r\nMarion whose people were well to do. As Corbett had nothing but brains\r\nfor assets, one of the brothers of the bride did not like this marriage\r\nand came to the house of a friend just after the wedding with a party\r\nof young fellows to horsewhip the groom, who was not a very large man,\r\nbut an active one. The groom was not at all backward about meeting his\r\nantagonist and gave him a thrashing to such an extent that he had no\r\ncause to forget it very soon, much to the enjoyment of the crowd who\r\nall took Corbett's side. It was not long until Corbett displayed great\r\nability as an attorney, and became financially successful as well.\r\n\r\nNorman W. Isbell located in Marion in 1842, being a native of Ohio. He\r\nserved as county judge, in which position he rendered excellent\r\nservice. In politics he was a whig, but when the slavery issue sent\r\nthat neutral party out of existence, Judge Isbell became a republican.\r\nIn 1854 he became a partner of N. M. Hubbard, which partnership\r\ncontinued up to about 1860, with the exception of the time when he held\r\noffice. In 1855 he was elected supreme judge of the state, resigning in\r\n1856 on account of failing health. In September, 1862, upon the\r\nresignation of Judge William E. Miller, Governor Kirkwood appointed\r\nJudge Isbell to fill the vacancy on the supreme bench. He was elected\r\nat the expiration of the term, but resigned in 1864, removing to\r\nCalifornia on account of illness, where he died of consumption the\r\nfollowing year at the age of forty-six. All the members of the bar\r\nproclaim Judge Isbell one of the keenest lawyers who ever practiced in\r\nthis county, at least in that day. His applications of legal principles\r\nwere sound and his illustrations apt and catchy. He was not a great\r\njury lawyer in the true sense of the word, and perhaps not as well\r\nknown among the masses as many others, but among the legal fraternity\r\nJudge Isbell was looked up to as a safe lawyer and most excellent\r\njudge, who by hard study had attained to high rank among the jurists of\r\nthis state. His son, N. G. Isbell, practiced a short time here, but\r\nremoved to Michigan where he died many years ago, before reaching\r\nmiddle age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHODIST CHURCH, SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF J. F. BUTLER, SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\nAnother lawyer of much ability and universally respected was Isaac\r\nCook, a native of Chester county, Pennsylvania, who located in Palmyra,\r\nMissouri, in 1844, and later practiced law in Dubuque, and also in\r\nMarion, removing to Cedar Rapids in 1848. He was elected to the bench\r\nin 1857. Judge Cook was of a quiet turn of mind, a man who never gave a\r\nsidewalk advice which he had to take back. He was elected the first\r\ncity attorney in Cedar Rapids in 1850, and was tendered a banquet upon\r\nhis resignation from the bench in 1858. He was also the first president\r\nof a republican club organized in Linn county. Judge Cook died in 1878,\r\nhonored and respected by all who knew him.\r\n\r\nJohn Mitchell came from Maine in 1853, entered Judge Isbell's office,\r\nand was admitted to the bar in 1857. He was later a partner of Judge\r\nSmythe and Judge Lothian. Mitchell died a few years ago, one of the\r\noldest practitioners in the county.\r\n\r\nR. D. Stephens was born in New York in 1829, and came to Marion in 1855\r\nwithout means, but with a splendid training and with a lively interest\r\nfor business. He entered the law office of Isbell & Hubbard, later\r\nbecoming a partner of Judge Hubbard. Mr. Stephens at an early date\r\nbecame interested in politics, and later became famous as a commercial\r\nlawyer and financier. He died in Cedar Rapids as president of the\r\nMerchants National Bank, and was rated one of the wealthiest men in the\r\ncounty. His son, R. D. Stephens. Jr., is now a practicing attorney in\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nJoe B. Young was born in 1832 in Pennsylvania, and was admitted to the\r\nbar at Iowa City in 1853. He located in Marion and was prosecuting\r\nattorney in Linn county, a member of the legislature, and later a\r\nmember of the state senate, and for a time pension agent for the state\r\nof Iowa. Joe Young was cross and crabbed in the court, frequently\r\nopposed the judge, as well as the opposing counsel, and displayed on\r\nmany occasions bad temper, not to such an extent, however, that he ever\r\nlost sight of his client's interest or his case. He was a stubborn\r\nlegal fighter and was recognized as a great lawyer who never gave up\r\nuntil he had exhausted all his resources. He died in 1876, one of the\r\nbest known attorneys in eastern Iowa, universally acknowledged the\r\ngreatest wit and the most sarcastic in retort of any man who practiced\r\nat the bar. He saw only one side of a case and that was his side and he\r\nalways maintained that, backed up by proof, there was no other side.\r\nEven in church matters he differed with the majority, and organized a\r\nnew church, paying for it himself, so as to have things his own way. He\r\nwas a most signal man in his profession, always a student, and seemed\r\nto know everything which would likely reveal where motives start and\r\nwhere the secret springs of conscience were in a long drawn out law\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\nD. M. McIntosh was a native of South Carolina, and located in Cedar\r\nRapids in the '40s. He was small of stature, with a ruddy face and long\r\nhair, making an imposing figure in the court room. He possessed\r\nconsiderable legal ability, had many friends, and was one of the best\r\nknown men in Cedar Rapids. He died in 1859, mourned by a large circle\r\nof friends, who for years remembered how this brilliant son of the\r\nsouth had on many occasions lighted up the dull path of the law with a\r\nglow of fancy and spiced his remarks by the charm of frontier oratory.\r\n\r\nColonel J. M. May was another attorney who was well known in Cedar\r\nRapids, and who located here at an early date, and after him May's\r\nIsland is named. He was erratic and wasted a large fortune in\r\nlitigation with his relatives and neighbors over rights of various\r\nkinds. He died in Cedar Rapids a short time ago.\r\n\r\nI. N. Whittam was another of the pioneer lawyers who died a few years\r\nago, having located in Cedar Rapids in 1854. He assisted Judge Greene\r\nin getting out \"Greene's Reports of Iowa.\" He was in continuous\r\npractice up to the time of his death.\r\n\r\nEllsworth N. Bates, coming to Linn county in the early fifties, was\r\nquickly known as the silver tongued orator of the Cedar Valley. He was\r\nthe first city attorney, appointed in 1856, at $20.00 a year. He served\r\ntill 1860. Mr. Bates won fame and honor as a lawyer and editor, and\r\nbeing a person of tact and force of character, he won many friends. His\r\nglowing tribute to the men who built the railway, at the June\r\ncelebration in 1859, gave him prestige as a great orator. Mr. Bates\r\nenlisted in the Civil war and died from exposure a short time\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nGeorge Greene, who died in 1880 at the age of sixty-three, was one of\r\nthe best known men in Iowa at the time of his death. Born in England,\r\nMr. Greene educated himself in Buffalo, studying with George P. Baker.\r\nIn 1838 he came to Davenport and began to make a geological survey of\r\nIowa. After he had worked for six months at this kind of work, which\r\nwas not at all congenial, he located in Ivanhoe, Linn county, and\r\ntaught the first term of school in that vicinity. In 1840 he was\r\nadmitted to the bar at Iowa City, locating later at Marion, where he\r\nbegan the practice of law. The next year he was sent to the\r\nlegislature. Here he became acquainted with the prominent men of the\r\nstate, and as the law business was not flourishing he removed in 1845\r\nto Dubuque, and while nominally in the practice he became editor of the\r\n_Miner's Express_, which was then one of the nourishing papers of the\r\nterritory. Three years later he formed a partnership for the practice\r\nof law with J. J. Dyer. In October, 1847, Judge Wilson resigned his\r\noffice of associate justice and the governor filled the vacancy by\r\nappointing George Greene, who from that day to the day of his death\r\nbecame a figure of importance in politics as well as in financial\r\naffairs in Iowa. Judge Greene was a man of marked ability, having had\r\nexcellent opportunities and being possessed of untiring industry. In\r\n1848 he was elected one of the supreme court judges by the joint vote\r\nof the two houses of the General Assembly and served for six years from\r\nJanuary 15, 1849. During his term of office he reported the decisions\r\nof the court. These decisions were published in four volumes and are\r\nknown as \"Greene's Reports of Iowa.\" In 1851 Judge Greene removed to\r\nCedar Rapids, where he engaged in banking and where he was one of the\r\nmost active citizens in persuading manufacturers to come to this city.\r\nHe was instrumental in securing the Chicago & Northwestern, and the\r\nBurlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railways to pass through Cedar\r\nRapids. In politics Judge Greene was a democrat until the Greely\r\ncampaign, when he became a republican. Few, if any, have done so much\r\namong the early settlers in securing capital to be invested in Iowa.\r\nJudge Greene travelled much and personally knew many financiers in this\r\ncountry and in England, many of whom invested much funds in farm lands,\r\ntown lots, in bonds, and stocks, in Linn and adjoining counties. After\r\nlocating in Cedar Rapids Judge Greene had a number of partners. While\r\nhe, himself, did not devote himself actively to the law business, the\r\nfirm generally had a large practice. He was in partnership with Judge\r\nHubbard, Cyrus Benley, A. S. Belt, and with Judge Dudley.\r\n\r\nA. Sidney Belt was a southerner by birth, a person of much ability, of\r\nengaging manners, and well known in his day throughout Linn and\r\nadjoining counties.\r\n\r\nColonel Isaac M. Preston was born in Bennington, Vermont, in 1813, the\r\nson of a revolutionary soldier. He learned the trade of cabinet-making.\r\nAt an early age he drifted west, remained for awhile in Ohio, and\r\nfinally located in Marion in 1842, where he began the practice of law.\r\nThree years later he was appointed district attorney, serving two\r\nyears. In February, 1846, he was commissioned colonel to organize\r\ntroops for the Mexican war. He served as probate judge of Linn county\r\nfor four years. He was appointed by President Polk, United States\r\nattorney for Iowa in 1847. In 1850 he was elected to the house of the\r\nThird General Assembly, and after serving one term was elected to the\r\nstate senate where, during four years in the Fourth and Fifth General\r\nAssemblies, he was one of the most prominent legislators of that body\r\nand took an active part in the enactment of the Code of 1851. Colonel\r\nPreston had more litigation in his day and generation than any one\r\nperson in this and adjoining counties. He was strong before a court,\r\ntactful and invincible before a jury, and especially in the defense of\r\ncriminal cases he had no superior. The bar of Linn county during the\r\nearly days was one of the strongest in the state, and Colonel Preston\r\nduring his long and active practice before the supreme court, held a\r\nhigh place and was recognized as one of the leading attorneys of\r\neastern Iowa, a position to which he early attained and which he\r\ncontinuously held up to the time of his death.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smythe was born in Tyrone county, Ireland, in 1824. He\r\nemigrated with his parents at the age of fifteen to America and located\r\nin Linn county in 1840. He studied law at Iowa City, and in 1848 opened\r\nan office in Marion. In 1853 he was appointed judge of the fourth\r\njudicial district, serving four years. In 1858 he was chosen by the\r\nSeventh General Assembly one of the three commissioners to revise and\r\ncodify the laws of the state. This work was accepted by the legislature\r\nand became what is known as the \"Code of 1860.\" Judge Smythe was also\r\nappointed upon a commission of legal inquiry, and was one of the\r\ncommissioners to negotiate bonds by the state to provide a war defense\r\nfund. He served two years in the army as colonel of the Thirty-first\r\nIowa Infantry. In politics Judge Smythe was a republican, and from the\r\nbeginning of his legal career he took more or less interest in\r\npolitics. In 1868 he and Judge Hubbard were the republican candidates\r\nfor congress, a campaign which was waged with much bitterness, so much\r\nso that friend turned against friend and neighbor against neighbor. It\r\nis said that a few days after Hubbard's defeat he met a shoe-maker on\r\nthe street who had been a former friend but who had been persuaded to\r\nvote for Smythe, and Hubbard said to him, \"Jack, you will not need to\r\nbuy any bristles any more, just reach your hand over your shoulder and\r\nyou can pull them out of your back, for there is nothing about you but\r\na hog anyway.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Judge Smythe's nomination William Leffingwell was put up by the\r\ndemocrats to beat him, Leffingwell being one of the noted orators of\r\nthe state, but Judge Smythe was victorious. He attained to a high place\r\nas lawyer and as a constructive statesman. He possessed a profound\r\nintellect, was popular among the masses, and a just and honorable man.\r\nHe passed away when he had just reached middle life, one of the ablest\r\nand most versatile men in Linn county at the time of his untimely\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nJudge N. M. Hubbard, who was a unique character and one of the best\r\nknown men in Iowa for many years, was born in Oswego, New York, in\r\n1829, the son of a Methodist minister. He was reared on a farm and\r\nbegan life as a blacksmith, although later he obtained a university\r\neducation. Judge Hubbard located in Marion for the practice of his\r\nprofession in 1854, later removing to Cedar Rapids. In February, 1856,\r\nhe was a delegate to the state convention which met at Iowa City, where\r\nhe helped to organize the republican party. During the war he assisted\r\nin organizing the Twentieth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, in which he was\r\nchosen a captain, serving under General F. J. Herron. In March, 1863,\r\nhe was promoted to judge advocate and served in the army until he was\r\nbreveted major in 1865. This year he was appointed district judge,\r\nresigning after having served a year, to accept the position of general\r\nattorney for the Northwestern railroad in the state of Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe sayings of Judge Hubbard would fill a book of many pages, but many\r\nof them would need to be sterilized before put into type. Many of these\r\nwitty remarks are still repeated during a lull in the court room when\r\nstories take the place of dry facts. He was truly an original\r\ncharacter, not only as a political manager of a great political party,\r\nbut as railway counsel, and as a person who filled a large place in the\r\npolitical arena of Iowa for many years. A few of these sayings may give\r\nthe reader an idea of the man as he really appeared during these years\r\nof his political and legal career in Iowa.\r\n\r\nAt one time being asked how a new assistant behaved who had been\r\nappointed local attorney for the railroad of which Hubbard had charge,\r\nhe replied, \"Tim is a real bull in a china shop; what he don't smash he\r\ndirties.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking at one time of a technical lawyer, he added, \"here is my\r\nfriend J, he is so technical that he will fall all over a crowbar to\r\nhunt for a pin and not even see the crowbar, mind you.\"\r\n\r\nWhile judge on the bench, some pompous doctor who was a witness asked\r\nleave to go home to look after his patients, and the judge quietly\r\nreplied. \"You had better stay here so as to give your patients a chance\r\nto get well.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time an attorney who had formerly been governor got the\r\nworst of it in Hubbard's court, and he appealed to him as a man and\r\nfriend, saying that the judge evidently must have forgotten that he\r\nheld his position due to his appointment while governor. Judge Hubbard\r\ncoolly replied, \"Yes, I remember that very well as being the only\r\ndecent act of your term of office,\" and went on ruling against him as\r\nhe had before.\r\n\r\nOn a hot June day Hubbard was trying a case against John Weare, one of\r\nthe old pioneer bankers of this county. There was a lull in the\r\nproceedings, and as the jury was walking out of the court room Weare\r\npulled out a large red handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his brow,\r\nwhen Hubbard in his peculiar articulation, for which he was noted,\r\npiped out, \"John, it makes you sweat to tell the truth, don't it?\" The\r\ncrowd laughed, and the cutting sarcasm was never forgotten or forgiven\r\nby the aged banker, who was at the mercy of his old antagonist.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the many political campaigns a Des Moines paper accused\r\nHubbard of giving away five hundred tickets to delegates. He was asked\r\nby a friend about this and Hubbard replied. \"That is a lie, I gave away\r\neleven hundred tickets this year, that is all.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Parrott fight for the governorship of Iowa, Hubbard at first\r\nsupported his old friend, but when he saw the turn affairs were taking\r\nhe suggested that Parrott withdraw, but the candidate refused, adding\r\nthat he had so many delegates pledged, and furthermore felt that he had\r\nProvidence on his side. Hubbard simply replied, \"Well, you can take to\r\nProvidence and I will take to Shaw.\"\r\n\r\nWhile arguing a case before the supreme court, the opposing counsel had\r\npounded the table a great deal during his lengthy argument. When he\r\nconcluded, Judge Hubbard arose to reply in the following little speech:\r\n\"I am strong. I can pound this oak table to pieces for I have been a\r\nblacksmith in my time, and I will pound this table into splinters if\r\nyou say and if it will help me to win this suit.\" He went on in this\r\nmanner until the members of the court laughed, and even the opposing\r\ncounsel saw the ridiculousness of his performance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHODIST CHURCH, PALO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE AT SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\nDuring one of his last appearances in court he was called by the\r\nopposing counsel an \"old mossback who might have been a great lawyer,\r\nbut that was many years ago.\" When the lawyer concluded all eyes were\r\nturned on the old judge. As he arose to reply he said: \"True. I am old\r\nand not what I used to be, and I suppose I am fast getting to be an old\r\nmossback.\" Then he went on telling of the old lawyers he had known at\r\nthe bar in Iowa in the early day. He spoke of the methods of the old\r\nadvocates, and of their bitter political fights, then added, \"They\r\nnever tried to bolster up a witness, defraud an antagonist, or\r\nblackmail a client as they do now, and if the real up-to-date lawyer\r\nmust do such a thing in order to become great and prominent, then I\r\nthank God I am an old fogy of a lawyer and belong to the former\r\ngeneration.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Hubbard at one time abused Bill Harper most unmercifully in a\r\nsuit, and Bill Harper threatened that he would maul Hubbard into a dish\r\nof jelly at sight. The judge one day appeared in court shortly after\r\nthe trouble, when Major Thompson said, \"Judge, Bill Harper is looking\r\nfor you.\" The judge looked around, for he feared Harper, and not seeing\r\nhim, replied in somewhat of a gusto, \"I saw him in the park and if he\r\nhad done anything to me, he would never have been Bill Harper at all,\r\nhe would have been dead.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time while the judge was defending a railroad company in a\r\ndamage suit involving a large amount of money a colored man had sworn\r\npositively to facts in a case which everyone thought he knew nothing\r\nabout. In the trial of the case the judge turned to an old friend, and\r\na \"Copperhead,\" saying, \"I am glad there are some Copperheads here; I\r\nfought to free the nigger. I stood up to be shot at, now, by gosh, I am\r\na Copperhead. A man who will swear in court like that nigger did today\r\nought to be a slave and should never be free.\"\r\n\r\nJudge James H. Rothrock was a native of Pennsylvania, and as a mere lad\r\nremoved to Ohio where he acquired his education at Parker's Academy and\r\nat the Franklin University. He was admitted to the bar at Greenfield,\r\nOhio, removing to Tipton, Iowa, in 1860. He was elected to the house of\r\nrepresentatives in 1861 and was elected speaker pro tem. He entered the\r\narmy as lieutenant, and upon his return from the army formed a\r\npartnership with Judge W. P. Wolf, which lasted until he was nominated\r\nfor judge of the eighth judicial district in 1866. He performed\r\nservices as judge in that district with ability and impartiality. He\r\nwas serving his third term when he was appointed to the bench of the\r\nsupreme court.\r\n\r\nA few stories may be related of Judge Rothrock which in a way\r\nillustrate his wit and exemplary character:\r\n\r\nJudge Rothrock had been trained in the general principles of law and\r\ndid not go much on statute law. At one time he was one of a committee\r\nto examine a number of persons for admission to the bar, and a young,\r\nbright fellow seemed to have committed to memory much of the statute\r\nlaw of the state, but knew nothing of general principles. The judge\r\nquietly said to the young man. \"You surely are in a bad way, my friend,\r\nbecause the legislature might in a night repeal all the law that you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time he was on the bench in Linn county when George W.\r\nWilson, as receiver, brought in a wagon load of books to prove up a\r\ncertain assignment. Judge Rothrock asked why all these books were\r\nbrought in, and Wilson replied, \"To show up the receivership in the\r\ncase, your honor.\" The judge smiled and said. \"Don't you think this\r\nfailure was due to too much bookkeeping?\"\r\n\r\nAt one time as he was assigning cases, and not being familiar with some\r\nof the members of the bar, Tom Corbett appeared in a case assigned for\r\ntrial. The judge quietly asked Mr. Corbett's name and as Mr. Corbett\r\narose to speak Judge Hubbard blurted out. \"Jot him down plain Tom, that\r\nis enough.\" Mr. Corbett blushed crimson, whispering to another attorney\r\nthat he would get even some day. Judge Hubbard many times afterwards\r\nbecame the prey to Corbett's heartless raillery, his sharp retorts, and\r\npungent wit.\r\n\r\nAt one time there were a number of lawyers engaged in a hotly contested\r\nwill matter where Judge Rothrock presided, and as the attorneys talked\r\nback and forth across the table and there was more or less disturbance\r\nin the court room, the judge leaned quietly over, saying in a very\r\npleasant manner to one of the lawyers who had done most of the\r\nquarreling, that he did not see why he was sitting there. The attorney\r\nquick as a flash replied, \"You've got me now, Judge, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement from the bench Judge Rothrock was frequently\r\ncalled in to assist other attorneys in the trials of equity cases. It\r\nbecame a standing joke among the members of the bar that when they\r\nfound cases in which Judge Rothrock had written the opinion which held\r\njust the opposite of what he was contending for, they were certain to\r\nrub it in, much to the judge's embarrassment.\r\n\r\nWhile Judge Rothrock resided at Tipton he came up to Marion to preside\r\nover a term of court and as there were but few persons around he asked\r\nthe bystanders if there was anything doing this term of court, to which\r\nthey replied that they did not know. He said, \"Is Doty here,\" and they\r\nreplied that he was. Then he asked, \"Is Harper here?\" and they said he\r\nhad been present for the past day or so. Then he said, \"Bailiff, take\r\nmy grip and coat, there will be something doing this term of court; I\r\nguess I will stay awhile.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Judge Rothrock who made the famous entry of record in several\r\ncases after Doty and Harper had fought for thirty years, \"settled by\r\nagreement, each party to pay his own costs, peace declared, the same\r\nbeing duly ratified by the court.\" During these years Harper had lost\r\neverything he had, and Doty was content to have his lawyer share the\r\nincome out of an eighty acre tract of land and thus felt that he came\r\nout about even. He figured that the lawyer got the better half of the\r\nincome of this farm during all the years the litigation continued.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Rothrock was appointed member of the supreme court. He removed\r\nto Cedar Rapids, where he resided until his death in 1899. For thirty\r\nyears he was a member of that body and materially assisted in laying\r\ndown many sound legal principles which courts in the west have since\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nJudge Rothrock was not known as a brilliant judge, but was profound,\r\nand a man endowed by nature with the judicial temperament which so well\r\nfitted him for the bench. His opinions have always been known for\r\nclearness of apprehension, tempered by integrity and impartiality.\r\n\r\nJ. J. Child, a native of the state of New Jersey, drifted into Cedar\r\nRapids in 1854 for the practice of his profession. He was a large man,\r\nsomewhat stooped, of scholarly attainments, and besides had more than\r\nordinary native ability. Few, if any, excelled Mr. Child in knowledge\r\nof legal principles and their application to existing facts, although\r\nmany excelled him in the court room and before juries.\r\n\r\nJ. J. Child, J. J. Snouffer, and I. N. Whittam were instrumental in\r\nobtaining the special charter for Cedar Rapids in 1856. In the\r\nmunicipal affairs of Cedar Rapids Mr. Child held many offices up to the\r\ntime of his death in 1889. He possessed talents of a very high order,\r\nbut his mode of life lessened his influence in the community. Capable\r\nof most any position, he achieved little or no success, and died poor\r\nand unknown, because the baneful influences of drink sapped his\r\nvitality and ruined a brilliant intellect.\r\n\r\nOne of the most original characters in the '70s was Jerry Lynch, who\r\nhad practiced law in Benton county before coming to Cedar Rapids. Mr.\r\nLynch was resourceful as a lawyer, had a keen sense of humor, and\r\npossessed a great deal of ability. It is said that when Jerry had two\r\nglasses to the wind he was in his element, especially in defending a\r\ncriminal, for it is said of him that \"he always denied everything and\r\nasked for proof.\" At one time he was prosecuting certain persons and\r\nrealized that he had no proof. The rain was pouring down, and as he\r\nlooked out of the window he said with all the dignity of a judge, \"Your\r\nHonor, on account of the inclemency of the weather I dismiss the\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time he was opposed by several lawyers who made fun of his\r\npartner's military record. There is nothing that so touches the\r\nIrishman's heart as an exhibit of disloyalty, and Jerry arose to reply,\r\nsaying, \"My friend on the other side laughs at my co-counsel's military\r\nrecord. Let me tell you what he did during the war. He sat on top of\r\nthe northern mountain peak of Vermont with his breeches padded ready to\r\nslide into Canada at the first intimation of the draft.\" There were a\r\nnumber of soldiers on that jury and it is needless to say that Jerry\r\nwon his ease, regardless of the legal questions involved.\r\n\r\nMr. Lynch at one time defended a saloonkeeper, and was waiting his turn\r\nas Judge Shane passed sentence of \"guilty\" upon one after another.\r\nJerry arose to speak for his client saying, \"It is an unpleasant duty I\r\nam called upon to perform. I defend the worst saloonkeeper in Cedar\r\nRapids. He runs the worst hole-in-the-wall in Cedar Rapids, and I have\r\nbeen in there myself and I am ashamed to tell your honor that it is so.\r\nI am not defending my client, for he is a law-breaker and everybody\r\nknows it.\" And he went on telling about the depraved individual who ran\r\nthe saloon, and then he began: \"I am not defending the saloon, I would\r\nnot be here for that, but that man has a wife and children, and as nice\r\nchildren you ever did see.\" Then he went on telling about the kindness\r\nof that wife who was mistreated by a drunken brute of a husband till\r\ntears came into many eyes in that room. The sympathies of the judge\r\nwere aroused and Jerry's client was duly acquitted.\r\n\r\nFrank Hormel came to Cedar Rapids as a young man, from Ohio, possessing\r\neducation and courteous manners. It might be well said of him, that\r\nfrom nothing he attained to an income of $10,000.00 a year. Mr. Hormel\r\nwas lank and lean in appearance; was a student who devoted his nights\r\nto old \"Father Antics,\" the law. He argued to the court with much\r\nsuccess and was discreet and dexterous before a jury. He was kind\r\nhearted and generous to a fault, and attracted friends by the\r\nbrilliancy of his conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. Hormel has been declared by the older members of the bar as a\r\nremarkable man for adroitness in a law suit and for knowledge at every\r\nstage of the case. He was a person of many parts and varied culture,\r\nwho just before he had turned fifty was literally worn out on account\r\nof the strenuous life he had been living. He set his stakes high and\r\npaid the penalty.\r\n\r\nJust after the Civil war a number of young men drifted into Linn\r\ncounty, a number of whom had seen service and who later became lawyers,\r\ndoctors, and bankers in this and adjoining counties.\r\n\r\nAmong a number of attorneys who located here during the '60s these may\r\nbe mentioned: Mason P. Mills, John J. Powell, Charles B. Keeler, Frank\r\nHormel, Judge Leach, Judge Spangler, T. J. Dudley, Jr., A. R. West, H.\r\nG. Bowman, D. L. Palmer, J. C. Davis, J. W. Bull, A. V. Eastman, Henry\r\nRickel, C. M. Hollis, C. S. Lake, Judge J. D. Giffin, Colonel Charles\r\nA. Clark, B. F. Heins, and many others. These were all young men and\r\nall became more or less noted in the legal profession, as well as\r\nsocially and politically.\r\n\r\nMase Mills was a business getter, but not a sound lawyer. He neither\r\nhad the ability nor inclination for discrimination. He said of himself\r\nthat in his native place when a boy, when a medicine faker threw out\r\npeanuts for the boys to fight over, he always got his share. In the\r\nrough and tumble of law suits he was fairly successful for the reason\r\nthat he always associated himself with lawyers of ability. He was a\r\njolly good fellow, a great mixer, and knew men.\r\n\r\nMr. Powell had been in the army, was a college graduate, and soon took\r\na leading place among the attorneys at the bar in this county. He\r\npassed away in January, 1908, one of the best known and most highly\r\nrespected citizens of the city of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin Heins was in his day and generation a much talked of\r\nman. Of Ben Heins many stories may be told. He was noted for getting\r\nhis English mixed and his penmanship conformed to no rule, while\r\nMurray's grammar had never come under his notice. A wag once demurred\r\nto Ben's petition as follows: To count one, for the reason that it\r\ncould not be read; to count two, because it was unintelligible, and the\r\ndemur was sustained. Ben ran for alderman and gave up a day or two\r\nbefore election, as he had one hundred votes to the good. The day after\r\nelection his friends met at his office to ascertain the cause of his\r\ndefeat, when Ben broke out, \"Well, gentlemen, I did not know till today\r\nthat there were two hundred liars in my ward.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLACK HAWK PURCHASE (map)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF SPRINGVILLE SOON AFTER TOWN WAS FOUNDED]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST STORE IN SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING DES MOINES COUNTY SUBDIVIDED (map)]\r\n\r\nBen was not a great lawyer, but he had much business. During the Texas\r\noil speculation one of the oil boomers came to Ben and offered him\r\nfabulous wages to take him around among his German clients to sell oil\r\nstock. Ben soon saw the trick and replied to the boomer as follows: \"My\r\nenemies won't bite on this proposition, and I do not wish to soak my\r\nfriends in this way. You better look for some other sucker.\"\r\n\r\nMills & Keeler were in partnership a number of years, mostly engaged in\r\nrailway litigation. Mr. Keeler became known outside the confines of the\r\nstate, and died scarcely past middle life at the head of the legal\r\ndepartment of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway, with offices\r\nin Chicago. Mr. Keeler was short of stature, with black hair and beard,\r\nand in a law suit very nervous. It is said that during the Bever will\r\ntrial Colonel Clark, in the midst of the trial, said to Keeler, \"If you\r\nwill only put a feather in your hair, Charley, you would make an ideal\r\nMephistopheles without any further makeup.\" Mr. Keeler was a shrewd,\r\nwide-awake lawyer, whose mental constitution peculiarly fitted him for\r\nthe practice of law, who possessed the faculty of crowding the salient\r\nfeatures of a case in a few words, and who knew better than most\r\nlawyers what the law ought to be if he could not cite a case in point.\r\nHe was cold-blooded and had few warm friends, but everyone acknowledged\r\nhis abilities. His restless brain simply burnt up his tissues long\r\nbefore his time.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowman excelled as a brilliant jury lawyer, who by his magnetic\r\npersonality knew how to handle a jury and to obtain a favorable\r\nverdict, especially on the defense in a criminal suit where he could\r\nappeal to the sympathies of the jury. Mr. Bowman possessed the magnetic\r\nquality to attract persons to him, and was one of the most resourceful\r\nlawyers at the bar.\r\n\r\nOf the early practitioners at the bar all have passed away or have\r\nretired except Judge J. H. Preston, a son of Colonel Preston, still in\r\npractice in Cedar Rapids, and Major William G. Thompson.\r\n\r\nMajor Thompson must be given space in this sketch. He was an associate\r\nof Hubbard, Isbell, Cook, Stephens, Corbett, Young, McIntosh, Mitchell,\r\nSanford, David, and Greene. Judge Thompson is a native of Butler\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, where he was born in 1830. He was reared on a\r\nfarm, received his early education in a log school house and became a\r\nteacher. He attended an academy where he remained two years, when he\r\nbegan the study of law, supporting himself by working for his\r\nemployers. At twenty-five he was admitted to the bar, and in 1853\r\nlocated in Marion for the practice of his profession. He was a member\r\nof the state convention at Iowa City in 1856 when the republican party\r\nwas organized. In this year he was also chosen a member of the state\r\nsenate, serving in the Sixth and Seventh General Assemblies. In 1864 he\r\nwas one of the presidential electors, and was elected district\r\nattorney, serving six years. The office of general justice of the\r\nterritory of Idaho was offered him in 1879 which he accepted, but was\r\nelected to congress from the fifth district the same year to fill a\r\nvacancy and was re-elected for the next regular term. In 1885 he was\r\nelected to the Twenty-first General Assembly and was an important\r\nfactor in the impeachment proceedings against Auditor Brown. In 1894\r\nJudge Thompson was appointed judge of the eighteenth judicial district\r\nand served in that capacity until he retired a few years ago on account\r\nof advanced age.\r\n\r\nA few stories may be told about Major Thompson to give the reader an\r\nidea of the man and of the times. Tall, spare, and of commanding\r\nstature, with a wonderful command of language, he would convulse a\r\nwitness or magnetize a jury with his quaint sayings, and in a minute\r\nwould melt them into tears with his pathos or arouse them to\r\nindignation by his denunciations of what he believed was wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the Bever will case, in which Thompson appeared for the contestants,\r\nhe was to open the case to the jury, when Hubbard who had full charge\r\nof the case, said that he wanted Thompson to speak at least two days.\r\nThe major replied, \"Great God man, what shall I say to that jury except\r\nthat here is the will and there are the girls, they should have part of\r\nthis estate?\" He made the longest jury argument he ever made in his\r\nlife, which did not exceed forty minutes, but he won the case.\r\n\r\nAnother incident in the Bever will case might be mentioned. After the\r\ncase had gone to the highest court the parties agreed to compromise.\r\nThey objected to fees which were very large. Sheriff Dan Kinley had a\r\nfee bill of $1,000.00, which the parties contested. The motion was set\r\ndown for hearing, when Kinley stepped up and wanted his matter disposed\r\nof. Judge Wolf was on the bench and asked if the sheriff had any\r\nlawyer. He replied, \"No, I asked several lawyers and they all claimed\r\nthey were retained on one side or the other.\" The judge looked down\r\nupon an array of lawyers, counting about fifteen, and said, \"All right,\r\ngo ahead gentlemen.\" As the long string of lawyers came out after the\r\nhearing Major Smith came along and said to the judge, who came out with\r\nKinley, \"How about that motion for fees, Judge, which you have been\r\nhearing?\" \"Well,\" replied Wolf, \"there were twenty lawyers on the other\r\nside, and after lengthy arguments Dan and I managed to beat them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Judge Thompson was on the bench he used to sentence criminals like\r\nthis: \"You deserve just ten years in the pen, or as long as the law\r\nallows. You should stay there. I never heard any good you ever did. But\r\nI see your wife here. She looks like a good woman: I'll give you thirty\r\ndays in jail.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time a woman came to Thompson to get a divorce from her husband.\r\nThe judge heard her story. She stated that when the husband came home\r\nand the meals were not ready he would simply rave. \"How does he act\r\nwhen you do have the meals ready?\" \"Oh, he acts all right then,\"\r\nreplied the woman. \"Well,\" said the judge, \"I advise you to go home and\r\nfeed the brute, and you will have no trouble.\"\r\n\r\nOn the stump the judge was often accused of waving the \"bloody shirt,\"\r\nand he used to reply to his opponents that \"he knew what he was waving,\r\nbecause he had been there.\" When in congress the major was a member of\r\nthe committee to try the contested election cases. Colonel R. G.\r\nIngersoll was one of the attorneys frequently employed by the\r\ncontestants and he became very friendly with the members of this\r\ncommittee. One morning as the colonel entered and found the major\r\nlooking over some of the records, the great orator, looking at the Iowa\r\ncongressman, said, \"Major, I like you.\" Thompson looked up and\r\ninquired, \"Why so, Colonel?\" \"Well,\" replied the magnetic orator,\r\n\"because if I can establish the fact that my client is running on the\r\nrepublican ticket I have won my case with you, but it takes a great\r\ndeal more to convince the other members of your committee.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Wilson was an old character at the bar of Linn county, and\r\nmany are the cases on our county records with the words, G. W. Wilson\r\n_per se_. He brought more worthless cases than any other firm or\r\nindividual and was the owner of more tax titles than any other\r\nindividual in this or any other county in Iowa. His tax titles were so\r\nclouded that the court intimated in a certain execution \"that they\r\nwould never fasten on anything in particular.\"\r\n\r\nLinn county has had its share of \"constant litigants.\" The dam across\r\nthe river has been a constant eyesore, with rights vested and\r\notherwise. There has not been a time since the franchise was granted by\r\nthe state for dams up to the present time that some suit has not been\r\npending in the district or supreme court involving some phase of the\r\nproperty rights of the respective owners in common. The so-called legal\r\nownership of the dam is now supposed to be vested in the city of Cedar\r\nRapids, and fees are no longer forthcoming, so during the past few\r\nyears there has been a lull in this branch of litigation.\r\n\r\nWilliam Harper, J.

Wilson, Theresa\r\nO'Connell, Doc Paul, and Lewis & Mason kept the legal mill grinding for\r\nmany years. However, by common consent, Elias Doty, son of one of the\r\nfirst settlers, seems to have held the trump card for litigation in the\r\nnumber of suits that he has brought and defended. He is something like\r\nMicawber in this particular that \"he has become acquainted with the law\r\nby being made a party so often.\" It is said that Doty started his\r\nlitigation by taking a law book in a horse trade, from which he got a\r\nsmattering of law, which volume was cited in many trials until some\r\nup-to-date lawyer ruled the book out before a justice because it had\r\nbeen printed in England.\r\n\r\nThe Bever will case was one of the most hotly contested cases in the\r\ncounty on account of the large interests at stake and the prominence of\r\nthe interested parties as well as the prominence and standing of the\r\nattorneys employed.\r\n\r\nMany have questioned whether the lawyer of the future will occupy the\r\nsame position in the community as the pioneer lawyers. The legal\r\nbusiness is rapidly changing, and before many years the successful\r\nlawyer will be one who renders legal opinions as to what the law is\r\nbefore suit is brought, and there will be less and less of great\r\nspeeches delivered \"amid full houses and loud cheers.\" The pioneer\r\nlawyer arose to distinction and political preferment by force of his\r\nnative ability. It is doubtful if we shall in the future have a class\r\nof attorneys who will play such an important part in the upbuilding of\r\nthe county and of the state. It is doubtful if we ever shall look upon\r\ntheir kind again.\r\n\r\nThe practicing attorneys of Linn county at this time are as follows:\r\n\r\nF. B. Armstrong, E. C. Barber, A. R. Berry, U. C.

He acted as the safe counsellor\r\nand the family adviser. He drew up all sorts of legal papers, settled\r\nstrifes, legalized marriages. It was in the justice court that the new\r\nlawyer would show off his ability. It was an age when \"wit and whiskey\r\nwere the principal things at the bar,\" and the early lawyers by nature\r\npossessed the one and frequently partook of the other.\r\n\r\nBefore these country tribunals these young fellows at the bar were not\r\nmiserly of their eccentricities by any means. The justice courts in\r\nolden times were held under the oaks in summer and in blacksmith shops\r\nand grist mills in colder weather, and here when law was not made, the\r\npolitics and gossip of the day were often discussed. The justice was\r\nalways a leader in his community, and he led in many ways. The story\r\nfrequently went \"as goes the justice so goes the township.\" The voter\r\nplaced faith in the judgment of the justice and he ruled the community\r\nsometimes with an iron hand. However, the dictatorial justice soon lost\r\ncaste and some one else would be chosen at the next election. Much good\r\nwork was done by the frontier justice as peace maker, for often where\r\nquarrels arose involving a whole neighborhood he would fix it up in\r\nsome way, asserting with all the powers at his command that \"it was a\r\ndirty suit\" which must be settled.\r\n\r\nThey were as a rule men of character and of influence, and fearless\r\nwhen it came to dealing out justice to offenders and those who openly\r\nviolated the law. Of course they were backed by the sturdy farming\r\npopulation who could be depended upon to stand up for the rules as laid\r\ndown by the justice.\r\n\r\nMany stories may be told at the expense of the country justice. It is\r\nrelated of an old New Englander in Monroe township that when a case\r\ncame before him as to certain offenses and the attorney for the\r\ndefendant saw that the feelings of the justice were against him he made\r\na motion that the guilt or innocence of the victim be put to a vote of\r\nthe house. While he thought this was a little strange, still his sense\r\nof justice and his New England training asserted itself and the crowd\r\nvoted that the party should go free, against the protest of the\r\nattorney for the state.\r\n\r\nDr. J. H. Camburn was an able justice. The way he would take things in\r\nhand and decide matters were worth going a distance to see and hear.\r\nDr. Camburn was decidedly practical and had good sense. It is said that\r\nJohn Weare made a better justice than Dave King, for King had friends\r\nat times whom he wanted to help while Weare had no friends.\r\n\r\nJustice Snyder, of Putnam township, sentenced a poor fellow at one time\r\nto the penitentiary for stealing a bee tree when a tree of that kind\r\nand a whole acre of land on which it grew would not be worth more than\r\n$5.00. The constable marched the poor fellow across the country to the\r\nsheriff's office, awaiting further instructions. The sheriff sent the\r\nconstable home and told the prisoner to go home, as the justice had\r\nexceeded his authority. The scare at least made the poor fellow forever\r\nafterwards an ideal citizen and the justice always thought that he had\r\ndone a good job after all even though he had exceeded his authority.\r\n\r\nMany of the fathers and grandfathers of the present generation look\r\nback with pride upon the work accomplished by their ancestors who held\r\ndown the justice's office in some of the townships of the county. Who\r\ndoes not remember such names as J. G. Cole, Isaac Butler, Bob Hodgin,\r\nEd Crow, William Abbe, Burnett, Coquillette, Knickerbocker, L. L.\r\nDavis, Israel Mitchell, Wm. Ure, R. M. Gunnison, Wm. Cooper, J. S.\r\nAnderson, John Stewart, C. W. Phelps, Aaron Mohr, Thos. Goudy, J. M.\r\nAfftery, J. W. Babbitt, W. H. Hunter, H. B. Burnapp, J. Shearer, Geo.\r\nGreene, and scores of others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER THE SAC AND FOX CESSION OF 1837 (map)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATE DIVISION OF THE BLACK HAWK PURCHASE (map)]\r\n\r\nThese frontier justices were many of them men of culture and education,\r\nsuch as Mitchell and Judge Greene. Many of them were shrewd, as Wm.\r\nUre, Gunnison, Butler, Nugent and many others. These men saw into\r\nschemes which were frequently played upon men of the community and woe\r\nunto the man who got caught in such a game in the new community where\r\nall stood by the justice and the justice's rule was the supreme law in\r\nthose days. But the country justice, whatever his ability, always\r\ndecided on the side of justice and mercy.\r\n\r\nThe country justice was a self made man of sound judgment and by fair\r\ndealings was the arbiter of the fortunes of the county in an early day.\r\nHe is worthy of mention as a type of the pioneer who took an active\r\ninterest in the upbuilding of the county and in preserving order and\r\nenforcing law.\r\n\r\nThe following items show the importance of the justices in \"ye olden\r\ntime.\" These were found by a member of the S. H. Tryon family and\r\npresented to the Linn County Historical Society.\r\n\r\nLinn County,\r\nIowa Territory,\r\n\r\n     To any Justice of the Peace for Linn County, or minister of\r\n     the Gospel, These in the name of the United States are to\r\n     authorize you to join in matrimony Mr. James Hunter and Miss\r\n     Mary Rogers and fail not to make due return.

He was also the first physician to locate\r\nwithin the boundaries of Linn county.\r\n\r\nGeorge Greene acted as deputy clerk during the year 1841, and he issued\r\nalso several licenses to marry well known Linn county people, some of\r\nwhom were: Sarah Rogers to Wiley Fitz during January, 1841, and Mary\r\nStambaugh to James R. Briney in March, of the same year.\r\n\r\nOn March 2, 1841, Sally Hanes makes a sale of one red cow, two sows and\r\neight shoats for $20.00 to Jacob Mann, which fact is attested to by\r\nIsaac Butler and that the goods were delivered in person and money\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nIn Otter Creek township before W. H. Hunts, J. P., on August 30, 1852,\r\nthe following case was docketed: \"State of Iowa vs. Orin Draper,\r\nFelony,\" charged by William Garretson, attempted to poison his family\r\nand himself; that he is in fear of the defendant and dare not leave his\r\nhome and follow his occupation. That William Cress duly brought the\r\ndefendant into Court; that defendant denied that he was guilty and\r\nasked for trial. J. Hunt appeared for the State; defendant pleaded his\r\nown case; that after examination of witnesses separately and arguments\r\nmade, the testimony all being understood by the court, thereupon it is\r\nconsidered that defendant go free without day or date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n_The Schools of the County_\r\n\r\n\r\nSchools in Linn county came into existence almost as early as the first\r\nsettlers arrived here. Most of the pioneers came from homes of culture\r\nand refinement and hence appreciated the value of an education. There\r\nwere no public schools at first. Teachers were employed by private\r\nsubscription. Lessons were taught in the settler's cabin, fitted up\r\nwith rough boards or puncheons, and of course the attendance was small.\r\n\r\nThe organic law which provided for the division of Wisconsin and Iowa\r\nmakes no provision for education, and no reference to it. On January\r\n15, 1839, an act was passed by the Council and House of Representatives\r\nof the Territory of Iowa, providing for \"grants of property made for\r\nthe encouragement of education.\" This act has no bearing whatever on\r\nour present school system. It deals expressly with donations and gifts\r\nfor educational purposes.\r\n\r\nThe real beginning of our present school system is embodied in \"An Act\r\nto Establish a System of Common Schools,\" approved by the Council and\r\nHouse of Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, January 16, 1840.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprises in this bill when one compares it to our\r\npresent school laws; in fact, many of our school laws have not been\r\nmaterially changed since the enactments of 1840. It is interesting to\r\nnote that according to the provisions of this bill, the school library\r\nis not a new idea, but it was provided for. In Section thirteen,\r\nparagraph five, the qualified voters in each district were given power\r\nto \"impose a tax sufficient for the purchase of a suitable library\r\ncase, also a sum not exceeding ten dollars annually, for the purchase\r\nof books to be selected by a vote of the district, by the district\r\nboard, when so directed.\" Paragraph six of the same section designates\r\n\"the place where the library shall be kept, and the person by whom it\r\nshall be kept;\" and states that \"the superintendent of public\r\ninstruction shall establish the necessary rules for the regulation of\r\nthe library.\" Section fifteen provides that \"every person elected to\r\nany one of the above offices who, without sufficient cause, shall\r\nneglect or refuse to serve shall forfeit to the district for the use of\r\nthe library the sum of ten dollars, to be recovered in an action of\r\ndebt by the assessor before any court of competent jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting item is the fact that school inspectors instead of\r\nschool directors at that time had charge of the schools. In Section\r\ntwenty-three, these inspectors are provided for in the following words:\r\n\"There shall be chosen at each annual township meeting, three school\r\ninspectors in the same manner as other township officers are chosen,\r\nwho shall hold their office until others are chosen.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of these inspectors, according to Section twenty-nine\r\nof this Act, to examine closely all persons presenting themselves as\r\ncandidates for teaching in their township, and although a certificate\r\nmay have been issued to a teacher, if the inspectors became\r\ndissatisfied, under Section thirty, they might again require the\r\nteacher to be re-examined, and if in their opinion the teacher was\r\nfound wanting the requisite qualifications, their certificates might be\r\nannulled by giving the teacher ten days' notice, and filing the same\r\nwith the clerk of the township.\r\n\r\nJudge Milo P. Smith when entering upon the duties of his school at\r\nWire's Corners, just east of Springville, was examined by this method,\r\nand it is quite interesting to hear him tell his early experiences in\r\nthe schools of Linn county. Quite vividly does he bring to one's mind\r\nthe sparsely settled condition of the neighborhood around Springville\r\nand Viola, when relating an incident regarding his trip from this\r\nschool house to a party where he had been invited to spend the evening.\r\nAfter arranging his records and outlining the lessons for the next day,\r\nthe Judge states that he started for his destination, and about ten\r\no'clock at night realized that he was completely lost. Evidently he\r\nmust have traveled in a circle, for he states that about two or three\r\no'clock the next morning he saw a gleam of light flash out of a door.\r\nStarting immediately in that direction, he arrived at the place where\r\nthe party was held, just in time to ride home with the young folks.\r\n\r\nAt the same session, a law was passed regarding the sale of the school\r\nlands, and this law was approved January 17, 1840.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 1842, a bill was passed creating the office of\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction. The duties of this officer at\r\nthis time was very limited; they being of a clerical nature instead of\r\nthose of a supervisor. Of course there could be no school districts or\r\nanything of that nature organized in the county until after some county\r\norganization. The bill calling for the organization of Linn county was\r\nnot passed until 1840. It is quite interesting to know that it was at\r\nthis time that the Commissioner or rather what is known to-day as the\r\nSupervisor Districts were laid out. The bill reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of\r\n     Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, That the board of\r\n     county commissioners in and for the county of Linn, be and\r\n     they are hereby authorized and required to lay off the\r\n     county aforesaid into three county commissioners' districts,\r\n     prior to the first day of August, A. D. eighteen hundred and\r\n     forty-one, making the division as nearly as possible in\r\n     proportion to the population of said county; and the\r\n     districts shall be classified by said commissioners as\r\n     districts number one, number two, and number three.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. That at the next general election there shall be\r\n     elected from district number one one county commissioner;\r\n     and alternately thereafter there shall be elected from each\r\n     district one county commissioner annually, in accordance\r\n     with the provisions of an act organizing a board of county\r\n     commissioners in each county in this Territory, approved\r\n     December 14th, A. D. eighteen hundred and thirty-eight, in\r\n     like manner as though the county had been divided under the\r\n     provisions of said act.\r\n\r\n     \"Approved, December 31, 1840.\"\r\n\r\nThis is especially interesting, inasmuch as there has been a great deal\r\nof discussion of late regarding the number of supervisors in Linn\r\ncounty. The districts as laid out at that time remain today.\r\n\r\nBy an act of the same Assembly, approved June 13, 1841, Marion was\r\nestablished as a seat of justice of Linn county, and the commissioners\r\nof Linn county were authorized to employ agents to sell lots.\r\n\r\nThe office of the superintendent of public instruction seemed to have\r\nbeen short-lived, for on February 17, 1842, an act was passed by the\r\nterritorial legislature which repealed the act of creating the office\r\nof superintendent of public instruction.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 an act was passed January 15th, which in some respects amended\r\nan act \"To Establish a System of Common Schools,\" which was passed in\r\n1840. This bill (the one of 1845) really made what is now known as the\r\ncounty auditor, the educational head of the schools, and provided a tax\r\nfor their support.\r\n\r\nIn chapter 99, page 127, of the Territorial Statutes of 1847, there is\r\nan act relating to the common schools. In section 36, page 134, it\r\nprovides that at the next annual township election (which evidently\r\nmust have been held in the spring) there was to be elected a school\r\nfund commissioner. This commissioner is what is now known as the county\r\nsuperintendent of schools, and his duties were many and varied.\r\n\r\nIn the election book it is shown that in April, 1852, out of the six\r\nhundred and ninety-one votes cast, Alpheus Brown received five hundred\r\nand seventy-three, and was declared elected. In the formation and\r\nalteration of school districts, the records of the county go back as\r\nfar as 1849, in which records Mr. Brown signed as school fund\r\ncommissioner. However, this may be attributed to the fact that previous\r\nto 1852, Mr. Brown was clerk of the county board of commissioners, and\r\nthe duties of the school fund commissioner devolved upon that office at\r\nthat time; consequently the presumption is that when he entered upon\r\nhis duties as school fund commissioner, and began to make up his\r\nrecords, he naturally took from the records of the clerk of the board\r\nof county commissioners the things which belonged to the office.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown held this office for three full terms, also about six or\r\neight months additional time, although Albert A. Mason was elected and\r\nqualified as county superintendent of schools in the election of April,\r\n1858. Mr. Brown served until January, 1859, as school fund\r\ncommissioner. This came from the fact that the county superintendent\r\nwas provided for by the Statute of '58, the election taking place on\r\nthe first Monday in April, but at this time some of the duties devolved\r\nupon the county superintendent. By chapter 36 of the Statutes of 1858,\r\nsection 1, the office of the school fund commissioner was continued\r\nuntil the county treasurer was elected. The presumption is, therefore,\r\nthat for about six months we had both a school fund commissioner and a\r\ncounty superintendent of schools in this county.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, also, that Mr. Brown served as a sort of triumvirate,\r\nas he was school fund commissioner by election, for the simple reason\r\nthat Mr. Mason may not have qualified until three or four days after\r\nthe time set; he was also school fund commissioner by the extension\r\nStatute, and county superintendent of schools from the fact that his\r\nsuccessor had not qualified; in fact in some of the school reports, he\r\nsigned as both school fund commissioner and county superintendent.\r\nHowever, Mr. Mason entered upon his duties and served as superintendent\r\nof schools for one term, when Ira G. Fairbanks (who by the way, still\r\nlives in Mount Vernon) was elected as his successor.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult matter to state who was the first school teacher in\r\nthe county. In 1839 several schools were in operation. In July of that\r\nyear Elizabeth Bennett taught in Linn Grove, and later that same year\r\nJudge Greene taught at Ivanhoe. One of the noted schools of the early\r\nday was the one known as the \"Buckskin School,\" in Linn Grove, so named\r\nbecause teacher and scholars alike attended clad in buckskin suits.\r\n\r\nThe first school district was formed in 1840 with Marion as its center.\r\nAfter that school houses sprang up in every direction. The buildings\r\nwere constructed out of logs; the seats were benches hewn from slabs or\r\nlogs, and so were the desks.\r\n\r\nColleges early sprung up in the county. Of the three that flourished\r\nhere more or less at one time, the history of two--Cornell and Coe--are\r\ngiven at length. These institutions are now in splendid condition.\r\n\r\nThe third institution that in its day was a power for excellence in\r\neducational lines was Western, founded in 1856 on the borders of\r\nJohnson county at the little town of Western, in College township. Of\r\nthis institution the late Jesse A. Runkle, some years ago, wrote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"In January, 1856, Iowa City became the western terminus of\r\n     the only railroad in the state, and no other was built\r\n     within a couple of years. The fine country surrounding\r\n     Western, would easily lead one to believe that the early\r\n     plan was feasible, to make the school an industrial one,\r\n     where deserving young men could make their way through\r\n     school by devoting some of their time to agricultural work.\r\n     But Western was unfortunate in two things: First, none of\r\n     the railroads that were built in Iowa, ever came near the\r\n     town. It seems as if a Nemesis had brooded over the place,\r\n     for even the interurban now being built between Cedar Rapids\r\n     and Iowa City swerves from a direct line, and misses both\r\n     Western and Shueyville by about a mile. Second, the\r\n     surrounding country began to be possessed by a population\r\n     that in the main had little or no sympathy with religious\r\n     education, and the older generations were alien in thought\r\n     and temper to our American institutions. These things made\r\n     the task of maintaining the college at that point a most\r\n     heroic and arduous work.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING THE TWO CESSIONS AS AT PRESENT DIVIDED (map)]\r\n\r\nAfter some years of struggle, the college was removed to Toledo, where\r\nit now wields an influence second to none in the state.\r\n\r\nOne of the early educational centers in Linn county was the private\r\nschool established in 1850 in the Greene Bros. block, which stood on\r\nthe corner of First street and First avenue, Cedar Rapids, where now\r\nstands the building owned by Sunshine Mission. It was founded by Miss\r\nElizabeth Calder, a native of New York, and who in 1855 married R. C.\r\nRock, the first hardware dealer in the city, who came here from\r\nBurlington and whose place of business was located on First street a\r\nfew doors south of the corner of First avenue. This school prospered\r\nand was conducted by Miss Calder for four years when it was\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nOne of the first, if not the very first, teacher in Cedar Rapids was\r\nMiss Susan Abbe, daughter of the old pioneer. She taught in this city\r\nin 1846, the superintendent being Alexander Ely.\r\n\r\nMiss Emma J. Fordyce, at present a teacher in the Cedar Rapids high\r\nschool, contributes to this work the following sketch of early schools\r\nin the county, and more particularly in the city of Cedar Rapids:\r\n\r\n     \"It is not often in this changing country that a person\r\n     lives a lifetime in one community and sees the schools grow\r\n     from their beginning. This has happened to me. Of the early\r\n     country schools but two memories remain: a visit in the\r\n     summer, and one in the winter. There remains an impression\r\n     of very homely school houses, equally homely surroundings,\r\n     and very little comfort without or within. It is a standing\r\n     wonder that even now an Iowa farmer is much more likely to\r\n     provide an up-to-date fine building for his cattle than a\r\n     beautiful, well-ordered school-house for the education of\r\n     his children. A little has been done, but by far too little.\r\n\r\n     \"Early Cedar Rapids was a little village surrounded by\r\n     groves of oaks, crab-apple, plum, and everywhere the\r\n     climbing wild grape. Between these groves were the sand\r\n     hills on which grew vast quantities of sand-burs. Where the\r\n     Methodist church now stands was a hill which sloped toward\r\n     the railroad. Where the old Presbyterian church was, the\r\n     children coasted down 'Pepper Grass Hill;' and where Mr.\r\n     Crozer's florist establishment is, was a deep and wide pond\r\n     which, on occasions of heavy rain, furnished water for rafts\r\n     made from bits of sidewalk.\r\n\r\n     \"The earliest school was on the site of the present Granby\r\n     building, but of that school I have no personal knowledge.\r\n     The first school building in my memory was the three-story\r\n     one which was erected in 1856. It had a white cupola, white\r\n     trimmings to the windows, with a high, solid board fence,\r\n     painted red, surrounding it. An iron pump at the side\r\n     furnished refreshment to the spirit and ammunition for the\r\n     wetting of people. On the lower floor on the side next the\r\n     railroad, Miss Elizabeth Shearer taught the children. She\r\n     was a woman of fine family, fine attainments, and of great\r\n     patience of spirit. Superintendent Ingalls was in charge of\r\n     the school at that time. C. W. Burton followed him the next\r\n     year. His school board was A. C. Churchill, president;\r\n     Benjamin Harrison, treasurer; J. W. Henderson,\r\n     vice-president; D. A. Bradley, secretary. These were\r\n     assisted by three directors, J. F. Charles, W. W. Smith, E.\r\n     E. Leach. Mr. Harrison had a unique way of collecting taxes\r\n     from the delinquent foreign citizens to whom our system of\r\n     collecting them was a dark puzzle; when they refused to pay,\r\n     he notified them that on a certain day if the taxes were not\r\n     forthcoming, he would sell everything they had and apply the\r\n     proceeds to tax payment. The auction was often begun, but\r\n     never finished, as the taxes were always forthcoming.\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. E. J. Lund was one of the earliest of Cedar Rapids\r\n     teachers. For many years her inspiring example and her\r\n     patient work developed good children out of bad, and she\r\n     finished her life's work by taking care of all the poor and\r\n     unfortunate of the county. The Cedar Rapids superintendents\r\n     were Professor Humphrey, 1861-4, Professor Ingalls, 1864-5,\r\n     C. W. Burton, 1865-70, J. E. Harlan, now president of\r\n     Cornell, 1870-5, F. H. Smith, the latter part of 1875, J. W.\r\n     Akers, 1875-81, W. M. Friesner, 1881-5, L. T. Weld, 1885-6,\r\n     J. P. Hendricks, 1886-90, J. T. Merrill, 1890-1901, J. J.\r\n     McConnell, 1901--, twelve men in thirty-four years. The list\r\n     shows plainly the growing tendency to keep a superintendent\r\n     for long periods at a time.\r\n\r\n     \"The high school principals show the same tendency; A.\r\n     Wetherby, from 1870-1, E. C. Ebersole, 1872-73, W. A.\r\n     Olmsted, 1871-2, Miss Mary A. Robinson, 1873-86, Miss A. S.\r\n     Abbott, 1886--.\r\n\r\n     \"The original high school building contained four rooms. In\r\n     1876 it had a corps of three teachers: Miss M. A. Robinson,\r\n     Miss E. J. Meade, Miss Estella Verden, and had an attendance\r\n     of 106 pupils; it now has twenty teachers with an attendance\r\n     of 838 pupils. In 1876 there were five buildings in the\r\n     city; there are now sixteen. Of the teachers thirty-one in\r\n     number in 1876, there are two left: Miss Emma Forsythe and\r\n     Miss Emma J. Fordyce. In 1876 the total number of pupils\r\n     handled by thirty-one teachers was 1,752. In 1911, with 181\r\n     teachers, there are 6,122 pupils, not quite six times as\r\n     many teachers, but showing a smaller average number to each\r\n     teacher. Evidently the school-houses have always been\r\n     crowded, since the superintendent's report of 1876 says: 'We\r\n     have in the school district five school buildings, and these\r\n     are taxed to their utmost to accommodate the pupils already\r\n     enrolled.' He also remarks pensively: 'In your wisdom for\r\n     the coming year, you have reduced the salaries of your\r\n     teachers, and in some cases the reduction has been such that\r\n     some of your best teachers have been compelled to seek\r\n     employment elsewhere.' Since no following superintendent\r\n     makes the same complaint, it is evident that school boards\r\n     do improve. As to salaries, the salary of the superintendent\r\n     in 1883 is given as $1,000; in 1911 as $3,000, which means\r\n     the magnificent increase of $42 a year; not a great\r\n     temptation. The salaries of the teachers increase in the\r\n     same period about $25 a year. Comment is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the high school, the graduates of 1873 to 1885 were\r\n     but eleven pupils, with nine times as many in 1908. Amongst\r\n     the older and pioneer high school teachers were Mr.\r\n     Wetherbee, Miss Ella Meade, and Miss Ada Sherman, who\r\n     afterward decided to doctor bodies instead of minds, as it\r\n     paid much better. Mr. Olmsted, the principal of 1872, who\r\n     left Cedar Rapids in 1873 to found a business in Chicago,\r\n     died a hero. He lost his life in his burning building trying\r\n     to save his bookkeeper.\r\n\r\n     \"The tendencies in school work are shown by the fact that\r\n     the reports of the early superintendents are largely lists\r\n     of members of the school board, while the later reports give\r\n     large tabulations of expense. It is to be regretted that\r\n     Iowa has not adopted a series of uniform reports, giving\r\n     items almost impossible to discover as these reports are at\r\n     present made out. The older schools report seventy-two\r\n     pupils to a primary teacher. The newer reports are silent on\r\n     the subject. Since efficiency comes in handling the right\r\n     number of pupils, it would certainly be wise to keep a\r\n     careful account of this item.\r\n\r\n     \"The courses of the schools show the growth in public\r\n     service. The courses of the high school in 1876 are twenty;\r\n     those of the high school in 1910, eighty-three. All of the\r\n     older and more prominent citizens served as school directors\r\n     at one time or another. In 1858 J. L. Enos was president of\r\n     the board, Freeman Smith, secretary, W. W. Smith,\r\n     vice-president, J. T. Walker, treasurer, W. W. Walker,\r\n     director. In 1859 the names of R. C. Rock, E. H. Stedman, J.\r\n     P. Coulter, and J. M. Chambers appear. In 1860, S. C.\r\n     Koontz, Henry Church, William Stewart, J. H. Camburn, and\r\n     William Richmond served. In 1861, W. W. Smith, George M.\r\n     Howlett, Henry Church, William H. Merritt, A. C. Churchill,\r\n     and S. L. Pollock directed affairs. In 1862 E. G. Brown, A.\r\n     C. Churchill, J. F. Ely, George M. Howlett elected Mr.\r\n     Humphrey superintendent of schools. His reputation seems to\r\n     have been that of a man of great strength and the bad big\r\n     boys stood in awe of him accordingly. C. W. Burton, the\r\n     superintendent of 1865, was noted for his cleverness in\r\n     mathematics, and his deep interest in horticulture.\r\n\r\n     \"All of these early directors, superintendents, and teachers\r\n     were hard workers and great optimists. History has confirmed\r\n     that optimism, and from the services of these men developed\r\n     a race of ambitious, energetic, moral citizens to whom the\r\n     present Cedar Rapids owes a great debt of gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of County Superintendent Alderman we are enabled\r\nto give below some interesting data regarding our schools:\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the number of school corporations in the county was 42,\r\nincreased to 87 in 1909. The number of ungraded schools in the former\r\nyear was 178, and 166 in the latter year. The average number of months\r\nthe schools were in session has increased from 6.6 in 1873 to 8.9 in\r\n1909, and the average compensation from $39.78 to $73.50 for males, and\r\nfrom $26.33 to $50.85 for females. The number of female teachers\r\nemployed in 1873 was 244, and in 1909, 503. The number of male teachers\r\nwas 90 and 40 respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of attendance there has been a vast betterment. In 1873\r\nthere were 460 boys and 544 girls between the ages of seven and\r\nfourteen not in school. In 1909 these numbers were 29 and 17.\r\n\r\nThe value of school property in 1873 was $240,105; in 1909, $814,300.\r\nThe value of school apparatus was $2,309.50 in 1873, and in 1909,\r\n$20,035.25. There were in 1873 in the school libraries 482 volumes,\r\nwhich was increased to 17,079 in 1909.\r\n\r\nThere are now between twenty-five and thirty fine school buildings in\r\nthe country districts. They are modern in all respects, being supplied\r\nwith slate blackboards, hardwood floors, ventilators, cloak rooms,\r\nbookcases and cupboards. Several have furnaces and cloak rooms in the\r\nbasements. Some of the buildings are supplied with telephones, making\r\nit possible for the county superintendent and patrons to communicate\r\ndirect with the school.\r\n\r\nThe plans and specifications for these buildings are owned by the\r\ncounty, and are furnished gratis to the school districts wishing to\r\nbuild. All of these school-houses except two or three are not only\r\nprovided with libraries, cloak rooms, etc., but are also provided with\r\na good organ.\r\n\r\nThis year there is being installed a hot air ventilating system which\r\nkeeps the warm air pure, the cold air being taken directly from the\r\noutside and passed through the hot air radiators before being allowed\r\nto enter the school room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNELL COLLEGE IN 1865]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n_Historical Sketch of Cornell College_\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM HARMON NORTON, ALUMNI PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY, CORNELL COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nLinn county may well take pride in the history of her oldest school of\r\nhigher education, founded in 1853, when the county held but 6,000\r\npeople. But the beginnings of Cornell College are of more than local\r\ninterest; they are thoroughly typical of America and of the West.\r\nCornell was founded in much the same way as were hundreds of American\r\ncolleges along the ever advancing frontier of civilization from\r\nMassachusetts to California--a way which the world had never seen\r\nbefore and will never see again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATION AND THE FOUNDER\r\n\r\nCornell owes its inception to a Methodist circuit rider, the Rev.\r\nGeorge B. Bowman, a North Carolinian by birth, who came to Iowa from\r\nMissouri in 1841, three years after the territorial organization of the\r\ncommonwealth. This heroic pioneer, resourceful, far seeing, and\r\nsanguine of the future, eminent in initiative and in the power of\r\ncompelling others to his plans, was one of those rare men to whom the\r\ntask of building states is intrusted. He was not himself a college man,\r\nbut with him education was a passion. To found institutions of higher\r\neducation he considered his special mission. Hardly had he been\r\nappointed as pastor of the church at Iowa City in 1841 when he\r\nundertook the building of a church school, called Iowa City College. In\r\n1845 Rev. James Harlan, a local preacher of Indiana, was chosen\r\npresident, and with one assistant opened the school in 1846. The next\r\nyear Mr. Harlan was elected state superintendent of public instruction,\r\nand the college was closed never to be re-opened. It had at least\r\nserved to bring to the state one of its most distinguished citizens,\r\nafterward to be honored with the United States senatorship and the\r\nsecretaryship of the interior. Meanwhile Mr. Bowman had been appointed\r\npresiding elder of the Dubuque district, which then included much of\r\neast-central Iowa. The failure of the premature attempt at Iowa City\r\nhad not discouraged him; he awaited the favorable opportunity he still\r\nlooked for--suitable local conditions for a Christian college in the\r\nstate. It is a long-told legend, even if it be nothing more than\r\nlegend, that when Elder Bowman came riding on horseback to the Linn\r\nGrove circuit, he stopped on the crest of the lonely hill on which\r\nMount Vernon now stands. From its commanding summit vistas of virgin\r\nprairie and primeval forest stretched for ten and twenty miles away.\r\nHere there fell upon him, the circuit preacher, the trance and vision\r\nof the prophet. He saw the far-off future; he heard the tramp of the\r\nmultitudes to come. Dismounting, he kneeled down in the rank prairie\r\ngrass and in prayer to Almighty God consecrated this hill for all time\r\nto the cause of Christian education. And it is a matter of authentic\r\nhistory that in the spring of 1851 Elder Bowman and Rev. Dr. A. J.\r\nKynett, in the parsonage at Mount Vernon, planned together for the\r\nearly founding and upbuilding of a Christian college on this site.\r\n\r\nWith the characteristic initiative of the Iowa pioneer, Bowman did not\r\nwait for authority to be given him by anybody, for articles of\r\nincorporation to be drawn up, or even for a title deed to the land on\r\nwhich the college was to stand. Early in 1852 he laid his plans for the\r\nlaunching of the school. On the Fourth of July of this year an\r\neducational celebration was held at Mount Vernon, which drew the\r\nfarmers for miles about the town, and other friends of the new\r\nenterprise from Marion and Cedar Rapids, Anamosa, Dubuque, and\r\nBurlington. The oration of the day was delivered by State\r\nSuperintendent Harlan on the theme of Education, and at its close\r\nground was broken formally for the first building of the college. A\r\nmonth later a deed was obtained for the land and the following\r\nSeptember the guardianship of the infant school was accepted under the\r\nname of the Iowa Conference Seminary, by the Methodist Episcopal\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nIn this highly democratic manner Cornell College was founded by the\r\npeople as an institution of higher learning, which should ever be of\r\nthe people and for the people. It was born on the anniversary of the\r\nnation's natal day, and was to remain one of the highest expressions of\r\npatriotism and civic life. Christened by the head of the educational\r\ninterests of the young commonwealth, supported by its citizens,\r\nprotected by a charter from the state, and exempt as a beneficent\r\ninstitution of the state from contributing by taxation to the support\r\nof other institutions, the college was thus begun as a state school in\r\na very real sense.\r\n\r\nOne can not read the early archives of the college without the\r\nprofoundest admiration for the pioneers, its founders. Avid of\r\neducation to a degree pathetic, they depended on no beaurocracy of\r\nchurch or state; they waited for no foreign philanthropy to supply\r\ntheir educational needs. They laid the foundations of their colleges\r\nwith the same free, independent, self-sufficing spirit with which they\r\nlaid their hearthstones, and they laid both at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IOWA CONFERENCE SEMINARY\r\n\r\nIn January, 1853, the first meeting of the board of trustees was held,\r\nand in the fall of the same year the school was opened in the old\r\nMethodist church at Mount Vernon. Before the end of the term a new\r\nedifice on the campus was so far completed that it was available for\r\nschool purposes and \"on the morning of November 14, 1853, the school\r\nmet for the last time in the old church and after singing and prayer\r\nthe students were formed in line and walked in procession with banners\r\nflying, led by the teachers, through the village, and took formal\r\npossession of what was then declared to be a large and commodious\r\nbuilding.\"[J]\r\n\r\nThe first catalog--a little time-stained pamphlet of fifteen\r\npages--lists the following faculty:\r\n\r\nRev. Samuel M. Fellows, A. M., professor of mental and moral science\r\nand belle lettres.\r\n\r\nRev. David H. Wheeler, professor of languages.\r\n\r\nMiss Catherine A. Fortner, preceptress.\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah L. Matson, assistant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Olive P. Fellows, teacher of painting and embroidery.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sophia E. Wheeler, teacher of instrumental music.\r\n\r\nThe first board of trustees is also noteworthy:\r\n\r\nRev. George B. Bowman, president, Mount Vernon; E. D. Waln, Esq.,\r\nsecretary, Mount Vernon; Rev. H. W. Reed, Centerville; Rev. E. W.\r\nTwining, Iowa City; Rev. J. B. Taylor, Mount Vernon; Jesse Holman,\r\nNorth Sugar Grove; Henry Kepler, North Sugar Grove; William Hayzlett,\r\nMount Vernon; A. I. Willits, Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe roster of students enrolls 104 gentlemen, and 57 ladies. Among them\r\nare familiar and honored names, some of which are to reappear in all\r\nlater catalogs of the school, either as students of the second and\r\nthird generation, or as trustees and members of faculty. Four Rigbys,\r\nfor example, were students in 1853. In 1910 the catalog lists three\r\nRigbys, one a student and two members of the faculty. The first catalog\r\ncontains the names of no less than nine Keplers as students, six\r\nstalwart young men from North Sugar Grove and their three sisters. Four\r\nWalns are enrolled from Mount Vernon, two Farleys from Dubuque and two\r\nReeders from Red Oak.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the population of the entire state was only about 300,000. Not\r\na railway had been projected west of the Mississippi river. And yet the\r\nscattered settlements sent across the unbroken prairie and the\r\nunbridged rivers no less than 161 students to the young school on this\r\nthe first year of its existence. The most important route to Mount\r\nVernon was the military road extending from Dubuque to Iowa City. Both\r\ntowns contributed their quota of students, Dubuque sending no less than\r\ntwelve, although the entire population of Dubuque county was then, less\r\nthan 16,000. Considering the difficulty of communications, the poverty\r\nof the pioneers, the wide extent of the sphere of influence of the\r\nschool is remarkable. Students were drawn this first year from as far\r\nto the northeast as Elkader and Garnavillo. They came from Dyersville\r\nand Independence, from Quasqueton and Vinton, from Marengo, Columbus\r\nCity, West Liberty, and Burlington. Muscatine alone sent seven\r\nstudents. This town was at the time the point of supply for Mount\r\nVernon, and the materials for the first building of the college except\r\nsuch as local saw mills and brick kilns could supply were hauled from\r\nthat river port.[K] Students came also from Davenport, Le Claire,\r\nPrinceton, and Blue Grass in Scott county, from Comanche, and from the\r\npioneer settlements of La Motte and Canton in Jackson county. The eight\r\nhundred students of Cornell today reach the school from all parts of\r\nthe state and the adjacent portions of our neighboring states by a few\r\nhours swift and comfortable ride by rail. But who shall picture in\r\ndetail the long and adventurous journeys in ox cart and pioneer wagon\r\nand perchance often on foot of the boys and girls of 1853--the climbing\r\nof steep hills, the fording of rivers, the miring in abysmal sloughs,\r\nthe succession of mile after mile of undulating treeless prairie\r\ncarpeted with gorgeous flowers stretching unbroken to the horizon, the\r\ncamp at night illuminated by distant prairie fires, until at last a\r\nboat shaped hill surmounted by a lonely red brick building lifts itself\r\nabove the horizon, and the goal of the long journey is in view!\r\n\r\nNo doubt there were other hardships awaiting these students after their\r\narrival. Rule No. 1 of the new school compelled their rising at five\r\no'clock in the morning. They were expected to furnish their own beds,\r\nlights, mirrors, etc., when boarding in Seminary Hall. It is\r\ninteresting to note that they paid for tuition $4.00 and $5.00 per\r\nquarter, and for board from $1.50 to $1.75 per week. The next year the\r\nsteward's petition to the board of trustees that he be allowed to put\r\nthree students in each of the little rooms was granted with the proviso\r\n\"that he furnish suitable bunks for the same.\" The catalog's statement\r\nregarding apparatus is a guarded one: \"The Institution is furnished\r\nwith apparatus for illustrating some of the most important principles\r\nof Natural Science. As the wants of school demand, additions will be\r\nmade to this apparatus.\" And that regarding the library is wholly\r\nprophetic: \"It is intended to procure a good selection of _readable_\r\nand _instructive_ books, by the commencement of the next academic year,\r\nto which the students will have access at a trifling expense. With\r\nthese books as a nucleus, a good library will be accumulated as rapidly\r\nas possible. Donations of _good_ books are solicited from friends of\r\nthe institution.\" In the next catalog it is stated that \"a small but\r\ngood selection of _readable_ and _instructive_ books has been\r\nprocured,\" the remainder of the statement being the same as that of\r\nthe first year. This statement appeared without change in all\r\nsucceeding catalogs during the remainder of the first decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DECADE\r\n\r\nAs early as 1855 the articles of incorporation were amended changing\r\nthe name of the institution to Cornell College, in honor of W. W.\r\nCornell and his brother J. B. Cornell, of New York City, men prominent\r\nin business and widely known for their benevolences to various\r\nenterprises of the church. It will be noted that Cornell College was\r\nthus named several years before the founding by Ezra Cornell, of\r\nCornell University at Ithaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe first year of the school under the new collegiate régime was that\r\nof 1857-1858. Rev. R. W. Keeler of the Upper Iowa Conference was made\r\npresident, Principal Fellows of the Seminary taking the professorship\r\nof Latin. Two years later President Keeler reentered the more congenial\r\nwork of the ministry, and Principal Fellows was elected president of\r\nthe college, a position which he held most acceptably until his death\r\non the day after commencement June 26, 1863, thus completing a full\r\ndecade of years of service in the school.\r\n\r\nPresident Fellows had come to Cornell from the Rock River Seminary at\r\nMount Morris. His character and the quality of his work left lasting\r\nimpressions on his pupils at both institutions. Thus Hon. Robert R.\r\nHitt, of Illinois, writes of him as follows: \"He was a diligent, acute,\r\nand active student, and his personal character was admirable. It is the\r\nfortune of few men to exercise so wide and prominent an influence from\r\na position which, to the ambitious, is not considered eminent.\" And\r\nSenator Shelby M. Cullom has written: \"I regard Professor Fellows as\r\none of the best men I ever knew. I said it when I was under him at\r\nschool, and now that I am over seventy years of age, I say it now. He\r\nwas strong, honest-hearted, full of kindness, and a splendid teacher.\"\r\n\r\nHis colleague at Cornell, Dr. David H. Wheeler, described him as \"a man\r\nsweet-spirited, pure-minded, of fine executive ability, a rarely\r\nqualified teacher, a patient sufferer, a tireless worker, a model\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nA word may be said as to the members of President Fellows's faculty:\r\n\r\nMiss Catharine A. Fortner, a graduate of Cazenovia Seminary, N. Y., was\r\nsent out in 1851 by Governor Slade, of Vermont, as a missionary teacher\r\nto Iowa. Her success near Tipton was so marked that she was chosen as\r\nthe first preceptress of the institution. In 1857 she resigned to marry\r\nRev. Rufus Ricker, of the Upper Iowa Conference.\r\n\r\nWm. H. Barnes, professor of languages in 1854-1855, resigned to accept\r\na professorship in Baldwin University, Ohio, and is known as author of\r\nseveral works in history and politics.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Rev. B. W. Smith, after leaving the school in 1857\r\nbecame pastor of several of the largest churches in northern Indiana,\r\nand president of Valparaiso College.\r\n\r\nDr. David H. Wheeler, professor of languages in 1853-1854, and\r\nprofessor of Greek from 1857 to 1861, when he was appointed U. S.\r\nconsul to Genoa, was a brilliant and versatile man, author of a number\r\nof books, professor for eight years at Northwestern University, editor\r\nfor eight years of the New York Methodist, and for nine years president\r\nof Allegheny College.\r\n\r\nThe brother of President Fellows, Dr. Stephen N. Fellows, has a large\r\nplace in the educational history of Iowa. He assisted his brother in\r\nlaying the foundation of Cornell College, being professor of\r\nmathematics from 1854 to 1860, and later occupied the chair of mental\r\nand moral science and didactics at the State University of Iowa for\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nOn account of her long connection with the college, from 1857 to 1890,\r\nMiss Harriette J. Cooke exerted a more potent influence on the\r\ninstitution than any of her colleagues of the first decade. Miss Cooke\r\ncame to Cornell from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and brought the best\r\nculture for women which New England then afforded, as well as an\r\nexceptionally forceful personality, and rare natural aptitudes for her\r\nprofession. From 1860 to the time of her resignation she was dean of\r\nwomen, and her influence for good on the thousands of young women under\r\nher care is incalculable. After long service as an instructor she was\r\nmade a full professor in 1871, the first woman in America, it has been\r\nsaid, to be thus honored. Her chair for fifteen years was history and\r\nGerman, and after 1886 history and the science of government. On\r\nleaving the college she studied the methods of deaconess work in\r\nEngland, wrote a book upon the subject, and returning to her native\r\nland became one of the leaders in this new department of social\r\nservice. For many years she has been closely connected with the\r\nUniversity Settlement of Boston. On the recent celebration of her\r\neightieth birthday she received hundreds of letters of loving\r\ncongratulation from her former students of Cornell, and each of these\r\nletters was answered by her painstakingly and at length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET SCENE IN MARION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DANIELS HOTEL, MARION]\r\n\r\nThe first ten years of the institution were marked by a singularly\r\nrapid growth, considering the fact that they included the darkest days\r\nof the Civil war, when nearly every male student was drawn from the\r\ncollege halls to the service of his country. At the end of the decade\r\nthe faculty numbered eight professors and instructors, and 375 students\r\nwere enrolled, fifty-one of whom were in college classes, the largest\r\nenrollment of collegiate students in the state, unless at the State\r\nUniversity. The assets of the institution amounted to $50,000 in notes\r\nand pledges, a campus of fifteen acres, and two brick buildings which\r\ncompared not unfavorably with other college buildings in the west and\r\nwith the earlier halls of Harvard.\r\n\r\nIn a large measure this exceptional growth was due to Elder Bowman, to\r\nhis initiative and wide and powerful influence. The chief problem then\r\nas now was one of sustenance, and as a college beggar Bowman was\r\nincomparable. He travelled over the settled portions of the state,\r\nwinning men to his cause by a singular personal charm, and enticing\r\neven out of poverty money, promissory notes at altitudinous rates of\r\ninterest, farm produce, live stock and poultry, household furniture and\r\njewelry. His barnyard at Mount Vernon was continually stocked with\r\nhorses, cattle, and chickens--votive offerings to the cause of higher\r\neducation. A citizen of the town once told me how under some mesmeric\r\ninfluence he bought at high price from Elder Bowman an old book case\r\nand coal scuttle, begged somewhere for the school. This prince of\r\ncollege beggars once returned from Dubuque with a silver watch which he\r\nhad plundered off the person of an eminent minister of that city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM 1863 TO 1910--GROWTH IN RESOURCES\r\n\r\nNothing is so tame as the history of a college once the interesting\r\nperiod of its childhood is over, and the history of Cornell is\r\nexceptionally uneventful among colleges. No building has been destroyed\r\nby fire or tornado. No famous lawsuit against the school has been\r\ndefended by some Webster among the alumni. None of the faculty has won\r\nnotoriety by sensational speech or erratic morals.\r\n\r\nThe salient feature of the forty-seven years since 1863 is a marvelous\r\ngrowth unparalleled in some respects in the history of education. The\r\ncampus has been enlarged by addition after addition until now it\r\nmeasures sixty acres, including the larger part of the long hill and\r\nwide athletic fields along its northern base. To the two first\r\nbuildings, still used, one for the chemical, biological and physical\r\nlaboratories and the other for class rooms and society halls, there\r\nhave been added South Hall, built in 1873 and now used for the\r\nengineering and geological laboratories; the Chapel, completed in 1882,\r\na stately Gothic structure of stone, containing the auditorium, seating\r\nabout 1,500, a smaller audience room, the museum, and several music\r\nrooms; Bowman Hall, built in 1885, as the well appointed home of\r\nninety-two young women; the library dedicated in 1905, the gift of\r\nAndrew Carnegie; the alumni gymnasium in Ash Park, built in 1909, a\r\nnoble structure, one of the largest of the kind in the state, besides\r\nseveral minor buildings used for allied schools and professors's\r\nresidences.\r\n\r\nThe material equipment has made a phenomenal growth, until several of\r\nthe scientific laboratories are reckoned among the best in the Central\r\nWest, and the library, numbering 35,000 volumes, ranks as third in size\r\namong the university and college libraries in the state, and second to\r\nbut one of the city libraries of Iowa. The museum includes several\r\ncollections which rank among the largest in the west: the Kendig\r\ncollection of minerals, the Norton collection of fossils, and the\r\nPowers collection in American anthropology.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH IN ATTENDANCE\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Cornell has been a relatively large school measured\r\nby the number of its students, and its growth the last decades forbids\r\nit longer to be called a small college. Indeed, for many years it has\r\nmaintained its place as the largest denominational college, or among\r\nthe two or three largest, in the United States west of the Great Lakes,\r\nreckoned by the number of students of collegiate rank. The attendance\r\nhas steadily risen until, in 1909-1910, 741 students were enrolled, 450\r\nof them being in the college of liberal arts. The steady growth in\r\nnumbers of collegiate students evidences the satisfaction which the\r\nschool has given to its patrons, and an ever widening influence and\r\npower. Moreover, it has increased the efficiency of the school by the\r\ninspiration of numbers and the intensity of competition in all\r\ndepartments of college life. By bringing together students from all\r\nparts of the state and scores from other states, some with the polish\r\nof the city and others with the sturdy strength of the country, it has\r\nescaped the narrowness of the provincial and has attained something\r\nakin to cosmopolitanism.\r\n\r\nTo make Cornell an institution state-wide in its patronage and\r\ninfluence was the evident purpose of its founders. Nothing was further\r\nfrom their minds than a local college for the students of a town or\r\ncounty, or one drawing its patronage from a few contiguous counties.\r\nThe trustees have been chosen widely over the state and the attendance\r\nfrom all parts of Iowa has been surprisingly large, considering the\r\nmany excellent colleges the state supports. In an investigation made a\r\nfew years since of the geographic distribution of the students it was\r\nfound that 41 per cent of the collegiate students came from beyond the\r\nborders of the patronizing conference, and the counties west and south\r\nof the Des Moines river furnished 20 per cent of the students in\r\nattendance from the state. The college has thus grown to have a\r\nstate-wide field.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRATEGIC POSITION\r\n\r\nIn explaining the growth of Cornell college we must recognize, of\r\ncourse, that it has grown up with the country. We must relate the\r\ngrowth of the school directly to the material prosperity of this land\r\nof corn and swine, to the marvelously fertile soil and to the era of\r\nexpansion in which our history falls. The fact remains, however, that\r\nthe college has obtained somehow a good deal more than its due share in\r\nthe general advance. While the population of the state increased 330\r\nper cent from 1860 to 1900, the collegiate attendance at Cornell\r\nincreased 720 per cent. The college has grown more than twice as fast\r\nas has the state, and that notwithstanding the numerous good schools\r\nwhich have sprung up to share its patronage.\r\n\r\nWe can not doubt that much of the success of the school has been due to\r\nits strategic position. It is located in a suburban town of the chief\r\nrailway center of eastern Iowa. From Cedar Rapids long iron ways, like\r\nthe spokes of a wheel, reach in all directions to the limits of the\r\nstate and beyond, and bring every portion of the commonwealth and the\r\nadjacent parts of our neighboring states within a few hours ride of\r\nCornell college. It is located also in east Central Iowa, an area of\r\nthe state the first to be settled and developed, an area surpassed by\r\nnone in the fertility of its soils, and the wealth which has been\r\nproduced from them. To these geographic factors, advantages shared in\r\nlike degree by none of the early competitors of the school, we may\r\nassign a place similar to that given such factors in explaining the\r\ngrowth of New York city and of Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nWhile the college had thus had the city's advantages of communication\r\nand markets because of its nearness to Cedar Rapids, it has retained\r\nall the peculiar advantages which inhere in a location in a village.\r\nLike Bowdoin, Dartmouth, and Oberlin, Cornell has found in the small\r\ntown, rather than in the city, an ideal college environment. It has\r\nnever permitted the presence of saloon or other haunt of vice. The\r\ncitizens with whom the students have made their homes have been people\r\nof culture drawn to the town by its educational advantages. In all that\r\nmakes for the intellectual life, in libraries and collections, in\r\nlectures and good music, and church privileges, Mount Vernon has had\r\nmore to offer than perhaps any city of the state; while the temptations\r\nand distractions, the round of low amusements offered by the city, have\r\nbeen fortunately absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOARD OF TRUSTEES\r\n\r\nMore than geographic location, it is great men and great plans that\r\nmake great schools. Let us give much credit therefore to the men who\r\nhave administered the college as members of its board of trustees. Our\r\ndebt to them is like that of Michigan University to its board of\r\nregents whose wise plans pushed it early to the fore among the state\r\nuniversities of the west and far in advance of the place to which\r\ngeographic causes alone would have assigned it. Some of these were\r\npioneers of only local fame, such as Elijah D. Waln, Henry D. Albright,\r\nWilliam Hayzlett, Jesse Holman, Noah McKean, and Dr. G. L. Carhart, men\r\nwhose memory will ever be cherished in Mount Vernon. Others were men of\r\nnote in the early history of the state, such as Hon. Hiram Price, of\r\nDavenport, Jesse Farley, of Dubuque, and A. P. Hosford and W. H. Lunt,\r\nof Clinton. Especially to be noted is the long service which the\r\ntrustees have given to the school. Of the members of the executive\r\ncommittee Col. Robert Smyth, sturdy Scotch Presbyterian, was a member\r\nfor twenty-eight years until his death in 1896. On the same committee\r\nHon. W. F. Johnston, of Toledo, long president of the board, has\r\nalready served for thirty-three years. Col. H. H. Rood, another of the\r\nmembers of the executive committee, has served continuously as trustee\r\nsince 1867, and Capt. E. B. Soper, of Emmetsburg, since 1878. Captain\r\nSoper has long been one of the most influential members of the\r\ngoverning board, and it is to his initiative and faith that the alumni\r\ngymnasium is due. Dr. J. B. Allbrook has served since 1874. H. A.\r\nCollin was treasurer of the college from 1860 to his death in 1892.\r\nHon. D. N. Cooley, of Dubuque, served as trustee for twenty-four years,\r\nand Hon. W. J. Young, of Clinton, for twenty-six years, their terms of\r\noffice being terminated only by death. Of the present board of trustees\r\nthere may be named as among those longest in service, F. H. Armstrong,\r\nof Chicago; Hon. W. C. Stuckslager, of Lisbon; E. J. Esgate, of Marion;\r\nMaj. E. B. Hayward, of Davenport; Hon. Eugene Secor, of Forest City;\r\nDr. Edward T. Devine, of New York; T. J. B. Robinson, of Hampton; John\r\nH. Blair, of Des Moines; Rev. W. W. Carlton, of Mason City; Rev. E. J.\r\nLockwood and John H. Taft, of Cedar Rapids; Hon. Leslie M. Shaw, of\r\nPhiladelphia; R. J. Alexander, of Waukon; E. B. Willix, of Mount\r\nVernon; Senator Edgar T. Brackett, of Saratoga, N. Y.; O. P. Miller, of\r\nRock Rapids; Rev. Homer C. Stuntz, of Madison, N. J. and N. G. Van\r\nSant, of Sterling, Ill.\r\n\r\nAmong the eminent men who have served the college we must give special\r\nmention to Rev. Alpha J. Kynett, one of the pioneers of Methodism west\r\nof the Mississippi, who served on the board from 1865 to his death in\r\n1899. Dr. Kynett was the founder of the great Church Extension society\r\nand for many years was its chief executive. In this capacity he\r\nprobably built more churches than any man who has ever lived. For a\r\nthird of a century he was a close friend and adviser of the college,\r\nand all his wide experience and his ability as an organizer and\r\nfinancier were always at its service.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nIn 1863 occurred the sad death of President Fellows, under whose\r\nsuperintendence the school had been organized. He was succeeded in\r\noffice by William Fletcher King, a graduate of the Ohio Wesleyan\r\nUniversity and a member of its faculty, who thus brought to Cornell an\r\nacquaintance with the scope and methods of one of the best colleges of\r\nthe middle west. At the time of his election to the presidency Dr. King\r\nwas professor of Latin and Greek at Cornell, and thus for the second\r\ntime a president was chosen from the ranks of those actively engaged in\r\nthe work of higher education rather than, as was then almost\r\nuniversally the custom, from those of another profession. In 1908 Dr.\r\nKing resigned his office after a term of service of forty-five years.\r\nFor a number of years he had thus been the oldest college president in\r\nthe United States in the duration of his office. His administration was\r\nessentially a business administration, with little talk but much of\r\ndoing. There was in it nothing spectacular, and no pretense, or sham.\r\nNo discourteous act ever strained friendly relations with other\r\nschools. Dr. King made no enemies and no mistakes. He was ever tactful,\r\npoised, discreet, far-seeing, winning men to the support of his wise\r\nand well-laid plans but never forcing their acceptance. The college\r\nitself is a monument to this successful business administration. For\r\nCornell does not owe its success to any munificent gifts. Like John\r\nHarvard, W. W. Cornell and his brother left the college which\r\nperpetuates their memories little more than a good name and a few good\r\nbooks. No donation of more than $25,000 was received until more than\r\nforty years of the history of the college had elapsed. Whatever\r\nexcellence the college has attained is due to the skill and patience of\r\nits builders and not to any unlimited or even large funds at their\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nOn the resignation of Dr. King, the presidency passed to his logical\r\nsuccessor, Dr. James Elliott Harlan, who had served as vice president\r\nof the college since 1881. He had long had the management and\r\ninvestment of the large funds of the college and the administration of\r\nthe school in its immediate relations with the students. Just,\r\nsympathetic, patient, he had won the esteem of all connected with the\r\ncollege, and to him was largely due the exceptional tranquillity which\r\nthe college had enjoyed in all its intimate relations. Dr. Harlan was\r\ngraduated from Cornell College in 1869. For three years he was\r\nsuperintendent of the schools of Cedar Rapids, and for one year he held\r\na similar place at Sterling, Ill. From here he was called to the alumni\r\nprofessorship of mathematics in Cornell College. The larger part of his\r\nlife has thus been bound up inextricably with the school. He knows and\r\nis known and loved by all the alumni and old students. The first year\r\nof his administration was signalized by the erection of the new alumni\r\ngymnasium, and the second by the conditional gift by the general\r\neducational board of $100,000.00 to its endowment funds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. SAMUEL M. FELLOWS, A. M. First President Cornell\r\nCollege]\r\n\r\nThe dean of the college since 1902 has been Professor H. H. Freer, a\r\ngraduate of the school of the class of 1869, and a member of the\r\nfaculty since 1870. Dean Freer was one of the first men in Iowa to see\r\nthe need of schools of education in connection with colleges and\r\nuniversities and was placed at the head of such a school--the normal\r\ndepartment of Cornell--early in the '70s. As has recently been said\r\nof him by Pres. H. H. Seerley, of Iowa Teachers College, \"his\r\nconnection with teacher education is probably unexcelled in Iowa\r\neducational history and no tribute that can be paid could do justice to\r\nhis faithful endeavors.\" Dean Freer has been most intimately connected\r\nwith the administration for many years. In 1873 he organized the\r\nalumni, with the help of Rev. Dr. J. B. Albrook, for the endowment of a\r\nprofessorship. At that time there were but 108 living graduates,\r\nforty-seven of whom were women. Of the men, only thirty-eight had been\r\nout of college more than three years. Yet this audacious enterprise was\r\ncarried through to complete success and was followed by the endowment\r\nof a second alumni chair. In all of the great financial campaigns Dean\r\nFreer has been indispensible, and the moneys he has secured to the\r\ncollege amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. More than this, by\r\nhis wide acquaintance throughout the state and by his cordial\r\nfriendship with all old students, he has been one of the chief\r\nrepresentatives of the college around whom its friends have ever\r\nrallied. Since 1887 he has been professor of political economy in the\r\ncollege, and now occupies the David Joyce chair of economics and\r\nsociology.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FACULTY\r\n\r\nOf the nearly 300 teachers who have been enrolled in the faculties of\r\nthe college there is space for the mention of but few names: Dr. Alonzo\r\nCollin, who began by teaching all the sciences and mathematics in the\r\nyoung school in 1860, and resigned in 1906 as professor of physics; Dr.\r\nHugh Boyd, professor of Latin from 1871 to 1906; Prof. S. N. Williams,\r\nhead of the school of civil engineering since 1873; Prof. George O.\r\nCurme, professor of German from 1884 to 1897, now a member of the\r\nfaculty of Northwestern University; Dr. W. S. Ebersole, professor of\r\nGreek since 1892; Dr. James A. James, professor of history from 1893 to\r\n1897, now teaching in Northwestern University; Prof. H. M. Kelley,\r\nprofessor of biology since 1894; Dr. Thomas Nicholson, professor of the\r\nEnglish Bible from 1894 to 1904, now general educational secretary of\r\nthe M. E. church; Dr. F. A. Wood, professor of German from 1897 to\r\n1903, now member of the faculty of University of Chicago; Prof. Mary\r\nBurr Norton, alumni professor of mathematics, whose connection with the\r\nfaculty dates from 1877; Dr. H. C. Stanclift, professor of history\r\nsince 1899; Dr. Nicholas Knight, professor of chemistry since 1899; Dr.\r\nGeorge H. Betts, psychology, who entered the faculty in 1902; Prof. C.\r\nD. Stevens, English literature, since 1903; Prof. C. R. Keyes, German,\r\nsince 1903; Miss Mary L. McLeod, dean of women, since 1900; Prof. John\r\nE. Stout, education, since 1903.\r\n\r\nThe continuity, the long terms of service of the administrative\r\nofficers and the professors, can hardly be too strongly emphasized as a\r\npotent factor in the growth of the college. If the history of the\r\nschool had seen a rapid succession of different presidents and frequent\r\nchanges of faculty, if there had been changes in plans and purposes,\r\nfactions and struggles, and the loss of friends which such struggles\r\nentail, if the power of the machinery had been wasted in internal\r\nfriction we may be sure that the story of the college would have been\r\nfar other than it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALUMNI\r\n\r\nThe graduates of Cornell now number 1,446. This small army of educated\r\nmen and women have scattered widely over all the states of the union\r\nand to many foreign countries. They have entered many vocations. The\r\nprofession receiving the largest number is teaching. Of the 1,139\r\ngraduates including the class of 1905, reported in the catalog of 1908,\r\nninety-seven have been engaged in teaching in colleges and\r\nuniversities, and 165 in secondary and normal schools. One hundred and\r\nforty-nine have entered the law, and 139 have entered the ministry.\r\nBusiness and banking were the employments of 113. Medicine has been the\r\nchoice of forty-nine, and engineering and architecture of fifty-two.\r\nThe foreign missionary field has claimed thirty-four, and social\r\nservice in charity organization societies, deaconess work, social\r\nsettlements, and the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. have engaged\r\ntwenty-six. Thirty-two have engaged in farming, and twenty-six in\r\nnewspaper work. The women graduates of the school very largely have\r\nbeen induced to enter the profession of matrimony. Up to 1876, for\r\nexample, ninety per cent of the alumnae had married. Of later years the\r\nlarger opportunities for professional service, opening for women, and\r\nno doubt other general causes, have decreased the percentage, but of\r\nall women graduates up to the year 1900, seventy per cent have married.\r\nOf these forty-two per cent have married graduates of the college. The\r\ncommon error that college education lessens the opportunities of woman\r\nfor her natural vocation is disproved, at least so far as Cornell\r\ncollege is concerned. The marriages of the graduates of Cornell have\r\nbeen singularly fortunate. Among the more than 1,400 alumni, there has\r\nbeen so far as known but two divorces. Considering the high percentages\r\nof divorce in the states of the Union, rising as high in some states as\r\none divorce to every six marriages, the divorceless history of the\r\nCornell alumni witnesses the sociologic value of the Christian\r\nco-educational college.\r\n\r\nIn numbers the graduating classes have steadily increased. The first\r\nclass, that of 1858, consisted of two members, Mr. and Mrs. Matthew\r\nCavanaugh, of Iowa City. Classes remained small, never exceeding five,\r\nuntil the close of the Civil war when the young men who had entered the\r\nservice of their country, and who survived the war, returned to school.\r\nIn 1867 eleven were graduated, and in 1869 the class numbered\r\ntwenty-two. The last decade the graduating class from the college of\r\nliberal arts has averaged sixty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNELL AND THE WAR FOR THE UNION\r\n\r\nPresident Charles W. Elliot, in one of his educational addresses, after\r\nenumerating what the community must do for the college, asks, \"And what\r\nwill the college do for the community? It will make rich returns of\r\nlearning, of poetry, and of piety, and of that fine sense of civic duty\r\nwithout which republics are impossible.\" That Cornell has made all\r\nthese returns in ample measure is shown by the roster of the alumni\r\nwith its many eminent names in the service of state and church. More\r\nthan fifteen thousand young men and women have left the college halls\r\ncarrying with them for the enrichment of the community stores of\r\nlearning, poetic ideals of life, and vital piety. The fine sense of\r\ncivic duty which the college breeds finds special illustration in the\r\ncrisis of the Civil war, and here we may quote the eloquent words of\r\nColonel Harry H. Rood in an address delivered at the Semi-Centennial of\r\nthe college in 1904:\r\n\r\n     \"The first seven and a half years in the history of this\r\n     college was a period of struggle and embarrassment. The\r\n     spring of 1861 seemed to be the beginning of brighter days.\r\n     A railway had brought it in touch with the outer world, and\r\n     the effects of the great financial panic of 1857 were\r\n     passing, enabling the sons and daughters of the pioneers to\r\n     enter its halls to secure the education they so greatly\r\n     desired. The sky of hope was quickly overcast, and the storm\r\n     cloud of the Civil war, which had been gathering for half a\r\n     century, burst over the land. The students of Cornell were\r\n     not surprised or alarmed. The winter preceding they had\r\n     organized a mock congress with every state represented, in\r\n     which all the issues of the coming conflict were fully\r\n     discussed and understood.... The first regiment the young\r\n     state sent out to preserve the Union had in its ranks a\r\n     company from this county--_one-third of the names upon its\r\n     muster rolls were students from this school. The first full\r\n     company to go from this township into the three years\r\n     service had one-third of its membership from this college,\r\n     and the second full company from the township, in 1862, also\r\n     had an equal number of Cornell's patriotic sons._ In the\r\n     great crisis of 1864, when President Lincoln asked for men\r\n     to relieve the veteran regiments and permit them to go to\r\n     the front, _almost a full company were college men_. In the\r\n     class of 1861 only two men were graduated and both entered\r\n     the service.... The record shows that from 1853 to 1871\r\n     fifty-four men were graduated from the college, and of these\r\n     thirty had worn the blue.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the war the college had much the aspect of a female seminary to\r\nwhich a few young boys and cripples had been admitted by courtesy. In\r\n1863 but twelve male students were registered in college classes, and\r\nat the commencement of this year all upon the program were women except\r\na delicate youth unfit for war and a boy of sixteen years. This\r\ncommencement was unique in the history of the college. On commencement\r\nday the audience of peaceful folk seated in the grove quietly listening\r\nto the student orations was suddenly transformed to an infuriated mob,\r\nwhen one girl visitor attempted to snatch from another a copperhead pin\r\nshe was wearing. So strong was the excitement, that the college\r\nbuildings were guarded by night for some time afterward for fear that\r\nthey might be burned in revenge by sympathisers with the south.[L]\r\n\r\nNear the close of the war it was seen that many of the soldier students\r\nof the college would be unable to complete their education because of\r\nthe sacrifices they had made in the service of their country. A fund of\r\nfourteen thousand dollars was therefore contributed by patriot friends\r\nat home and in part by Iowa regiments in the field for the education of\r\ndisabled soldiers and soldiers' orphans. No gift to the school has ever\r\nbeen more useful than this foundation, which aided in the support of\r\nhundreds of the most worthy students of the college.\r\n\r\nTwo of the students of Cornell were enrolled in the armies of the\r\nConfederacy. Of these one became a lieutenant in a Texas regiment. At\r\none time learning that one of his prisoners was a Cornell boy and a\r\nmember of his own literary society, the Texas lieutenant found Cornell\r\nloyalty a stronger motive than official duty. He took his prisoner\r\nseveral miles from camp, gave him a horse and started him for the Union\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Cornell college has been coëducational. In the\r\nearliest years of her history some concessions were made in the courses\r\nof study to the supposed weakness of woman's intellect, and \"ornamental\r\nbranches,\" such as \"Grecian painting,\" which seems to have been a sort\r\nof transfer work, \"ornamental hair work and wax flowers\" were grafted\r\non the curriculum for her special benefit--branches which soon were\r\npruned away.\r\n\r\nWoman's presence seems to have been regarded in these early years as a\r\nmenace to the social order, safely permitted only under the most\r\nrigorous restrictions. So late as 1869 Rule Number Twelve appeared in\r\nthe catalog--\"_The escorting of young ladies by young gentlemen is not\r\nallowed_.\" This was a weak and degenerate offspring of the stern edict\r\nof President Keeler's administration:\r\n\r\n\"_Young ladies and gentlemen will not associate together in walking or\r\nriding nor stand conversing together in the halls or public rooms of\r\nthe buildings, but when necessary they can see the persons they desire\r\nby permission._\"\r\n\r\nFor many years these blue laws have been abrogated, and the only\r\nrestrictions found needful are those ordinarily imposed by good\r\nsociety. The association and competition of young men and women in all\r\ncollege activities--an association necessarily devoid of all romance\r\nand glamour--has been found sane and helpful to both sexes, and no\r\npolicy of segregation in any form has ever been as much as suggested.\r\n\r\nThe social life of the college has always been under the leadership of\r\nthe literary societies. They are now eight in number: The Amphictyon,\r\nAdelphian, Miltonian and Star for men and the Philomathean, Aesthesian,\r\nAlethean and Aonian for women. The students of the Academy also sustain\r\nfour flourishing societies, the Irving and Gladstone, Clionian and\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nThese societies meet in large and rather luxuriously furnished halls in\r\nwhich they entertain their friends each week with literary and musical\r\nprograms, followed by short socials. Business meetings offer thorough\r\ndrill in parliamentary practice and often give place to impromptu\r\ndebates which give facility in extemporaneous speaking. The societies\r\nalso give banquets and less formal receptions from time to time and in\r\ngeneral have charge of the social life of the school. Members are\r\nchosen by election and the rushing of the incoming freshman class is a\r\nfast and furious campaign, occupying a week or so of the first\r\nhalf-year. However it may affect studies, it certainly develops\r\nfriendships and promotes the rapid assimilation of the large number of\r\nnew students in the body social of the school.\r\n\r\nThe societies have always been in effect fraternities and sororities so\r\nfar as social advantages are concerned, and they have performed the\r\nfunction of the best fraternities in the intellectual and moral\r\nsupervision which they have given their members. But the literary\r\nsocieties have been more than fraternities, and under their supervision\r\nthe social life of the college has been lived on a distinctly higher\r\nplane than had its organization been purely social and for recreation\r\nonly. They have also been markedly distinguished from fraternities in\r\ntheir democratic character. Instead of excluding fifty or even seventy\r\nor eighty per cent of the students from their privileges, they have\r\ngiven their inestimable social advantages to practically all who cared\r\nto join them. They have thus prevented the growth of a leisured class\r\nof students whose sole interest in college is found in its recreations\r\nand who have been allowed the control of the college social life.\r\nIndeed, so valuable in the history of the college has this social\r\norganization proved that students have suggested that it be extended to\r\nother colleges by means of affiliated chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOWMENTS\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier years of its history the college received few\r\nnotable gifts. It was largely sustained by innumerable small\r\ncontributions to its current expenses and endowment funds made by\r\ndevoted friends whose generosity and self sacrifice deserve the praise\r\nbestowed upon the widow who cast her mite into the treasury of the\r\ntemple. The larger gifts which have been made in endowing chairs, with\r\nthe amounts and dates of the foundation and names of the donors, are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     1859 Hamline Professorship of Greek Language and Literature,\r\n     $25,000, by Bishop L. L. Hamline.\r\n\r\n     1873 D. N. Cooley Professorship of Civil and Sanitary\r\n     Engineering, $10,000, by Hon. D. N. Cooley, Dubuque, and\r\n     Oliver Hoyt.\r\n\r\n     1873 Alumni Professorship of Mathematics, $50,000, by The\r\n     Alumni.\r\n\r\n     1885 W. F. Johnston Professorship of Physics, $50,000, by\r\n     Hon. W. F. Johnston, Toledo.\r\n\r\n     1902 Edgar Truman Brackett, Jr., Professorship of History\r\n     and Politics, $30,000, by Hon. Edgar T. Brackett, Saratoga,\r\n     N. Y.\r\n\r\n     1904 David Joyce Professorship of Political Economy and\r\n     Sociology, $50,000, by David Joyce, Clinton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMERCIAL HOTEL, CENTER POINT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER CEDAR RIVER AT CENTER POINT]\r\n\r\n     1904 Lucy Hayes King Foundation, now in support of the\r\n     presidency, by ex-president Wm. F. King, $50,000.\r\n\r\n     1910 Alumni Professorship of Geology, $50,000, by The\r\n     Alumni.\r\n\r\nAmong the other notable gifts to the college must be mentioned that by\r\nthe Hon. Andrew Carnegie, of $50,000 for the erection of the Carnegie\r\nlibrary, dedicated in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe largest donations to the college have been those of its president\r\nemeritus, William Fletcher King. Most valuable of all have been the\r\nlong years of service, but besides these he has given from time to time\r\nmany financial gifts to meet current needs and near the end of his term\r\nof office, he crowned his benefactions not only with the endowment of\r\nthe professorship just mentioned, but with the munificent gift of\r\n$100,000 to found 100 scholarships in memory of Margaret Fletcher King.\r\nAt the unveiling of the bronze tablet in her memory, in 1904, Hon. L.\r\nM. Shaw spoke these fitting words: \"It is my privilege to witness the\r\nunveiling of a tablet erected in memory of a saintly woman who came in\r\nbridal clothes and left in cerements, and who spent the entire\r\nthirty-eight years of her married life wedded as completely to Cornell\r\ncollege as to William F. King, and who served both with equal\r\nfaithfulness and with unfaltering devotion. Words are inadequate to\r\nmeasure the influence of a Christian woman's life spent amid\r\nsurroundings such as have existed here for a generation. Neither does\r\nbronze suffice to prophesy the lift toward righteousness and higher\r\ncitizenship of what is here done by the bereaved husband in the name of\r\nMargaret McKell King.... The tablet so thoughtfully erected to her\r\nmemory and the endowment of scholarships so generously made by Dr. King\r\nguarantee the perpetuation of the sweet influence of a noble life and\r\nextend the benison of Christian education to one hundred students per\r\nannum, on and on, far beyond the ken of those who knew her and knowing\r\nloved her.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the general education board made a conditional gift to the\r\ncollege of $100,000 for endowment, and of the $300,000 to be secured to\r\nmeet the conditions nearly half has already been promised in sums among\r\nthe largest ever given to the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURRICULUM\r\n\r\nIn the fifties Cornell college was a very simple organization. In the\r\nfirst year of the college as distinct from the seminary, six teachers\r\ntaught the entire round of the college course, which then included but\r\nforty subjects, each pursued for but three months. Besides Latin, Greek\r\nand mathematics, there were offered six terms in science and seven in\r\nthe following subjects: Natural Theology, Evidences of Christianity,\r\nMoral Science, Butler's Analogy, Mental Philosophy, Rhetoric, and\r\nElements of Criticism. This simple curriculum was stated by the catalog\r\nto embrace \"the course of study in Mathematics, Languages, Sciences,\r\nand Belle Lettres which is prescribed in the best colleges and\r\nuniversities. It is thorough, extensive and systematic.\" All the same,\r\nboth Cornell and \"the best colleges and universities\" have found that\r\ncollege courses could be made more \"thorough and extensive\" if not\r\n\"more systematic.\" Latin, for example, at Cornell now offers eleven\r\nhalf-year courses instead of nine third-year courses as in 1857-1858.\r\nSciences, which then offered six terms, now offer thirty-seven\r\nhalf-years and form five strong departments with their own professors\r\nand assistants. In 1875 the department of English Literature was\r\norganized, and the same year special teachers were employed for the\r\nfirst time in public speaking, although the School of Oratory was not\r\norganized until 1891. History and Politics became a distinct department\r\nin 1886. Courses in the English Bible were offered in 1894, and in\r\nSociology in 1900. In all, the last catalog lists more than two hundred\r\nhalf-year collegiate courses of study.\r\n\r\nThe college has been among the foremost in the west in adapting and\r\nenlarging its courses to meet changing ideals. As early as 1873 the\r\ndepartment of Civil and Sanitary Engineering was organized, in which\r\nhundreds of young men have received a valuable equipment for the work\r\nof life. One of the earliest recognitions of education as a collegiate\r\nsubject was when courses in this science were offered at Cornell in\r\n1872--the beginning of the present strong school of education. In 1900\r\nand 1901 special directors of Physical Training for both men and women\r\nwere first employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRIT AND INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nDuring all these changing years since 1853 the spirit of Cornell has\r\nremained essentially the same. It has made for scholarship--a\r\nscholarship honest, tireless, and fearless in the search for truth; it\r\nhas cherished culture; it has fitted for service and has sent forth its\r\nstudents to perform, in the words of Milton, \"justly, skilfully, and\r\nmagnanimously all the duties both public and private of peace and war.\"\r\nIt has ever been a religious spirit, too, this spirit of Cornell, and\r\nkindling in thousands of young hearts has inspired them to purer,\r\nstronger, and more helpful living.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Cornell may be summarized by a quotation from an\r\neditorial in the Cedar Rapids _Republican_ in 1904, reviewing the\r\nhistory of the college:\r\n\r\n     \"Fifty years of college work and college building; what does\r\n     it mean? What is it these men, about whom we have been\r\n     writing, have done? The half can not be told. No research,\r\n     however painstaking, could discover it all, for only a\r\n     portion of such work is ever seen of men. For fifty years a\r\n     constant stream of beneficent influences has been flowing\r\n     out from this institution. The pure water which gushes from\r\n     a spring on the hillsides, who can trace? A certain portion\r\n     will refresh those who dwell near its source. The remainder\r\n     flows away to form a brooklet that 'joins brimming river'\r\n     which carries ships, waters cities, and finally augments an\r\n     ocean current that washes illimitable shores. But for these\r\n     springs the everlasting ocean would dry up. The stream of\r\n     beneficent influences which has been flowing from this\r\n     institution on the hillside down yonder, has been carried\r\n     around the world--into countless fields of human activity\r\n     and high endeavor--into homes where mothers teach their\r\n     children to avoid those things that are of the earth\r\n     earthy--into business establishments where the golden rule\r\n     is not always turned toward the wall--into legislative halls\r\n     where statesmen and patriots are needed--into the judiciary\r\n     of state and nation--into the cabinet of the president of\r\n     the United States--into all callings and all\r\n     professions--into all countries and all climes. May it flow\r\n     on forever and forever!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n_History of Coe College_\r\n\r\nBY REV. E. R. BURKHALTER, D. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an interest, and a charm peculiarly its own in tracing a\r\nstream that has grown to be a river back to its head waters in some\r\nlake or mountain spring. And when instead of a river we trace backward\r\na college to its source and fountain head, this interest and charm come\r\nto possess a sacred value and are full of hallowed associations. And\r\nthe charm and interest become complete when this matter is pursued by\r\none who is not only a historian but also a participant in the\r\ntransactions which cover years of time and call up many holy and tender\r\nmemories of scenes and places, and yet more, of persons who were\r\nfellow-workers in the good cause and the most of whom have passed from\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe fountain head of Coe College, whose history it is now proposed to\r\nrecord, is to be sought and found in the mind and heart of the Rev.\r\nWilliston Jones, the pioneer pastor of Cedar Rapids, who for the years\r\nbetween 1849 and 1856 was the minister of the First Presbyterian church\r\nof this city. Mr. Jones was a most zealous servant of his Divine\r\nMaster, and labored zealously for His cause, not only in the local\r\nfield, which was then so newly opened for settlement, but in the whole\r\noutlying region. His heart felt the needs of this entire middle west,\r\nwhich, as a fertile wilderness, was offering such inducements for the\r\npioneer settler, and he longed to do his part to the utmost in\r\nassisting to provide this region with a gospel ministry. To this end,\r\nhe opened a School of the Prophets in his own home.\r\n\r\nWe now avail ourselves at this early point of our history of the\r\nvaluable contributions furnished by the words of the Rev. George R.\r\nCarroll, in his most interesting little volume entitled _Pioneer Life\r\nin and Around Cedar Rapids, 1839-1849_.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Jones had persuaded one young man, the writer of this\r\n     sketch, to devote his life to the gospel ministry. But there\r\n     was no school here in which he could begin his studies. At\r\n     last the zealous pastor decided to undertake himself the\r\n     task of preparing that young man for college. Meantime,\r\n     other young men heard of the arrangement, and persuaded Mr.\r\n     Jones to admit them also to the same privileges. The result\r\n     was the formation of a class of sixteen or eighteen young\r\n     men who occupied the unfurnished parlor in the pastor's\r\n     house, which was temporarily fitted up for the purpose. One\r\n     of the number was chosen to act as monitor each week, and\r\n     Mr. and Mrs. Jones came in at different hours of the day to\r\n     hear the recitations in the various branches of study\r\n     pursued. The branches studied were reading, writing,\r\n     geography, arithmetic, Latin and Greek. This school\r\n     continued its regular sessions for about six months, and was\r\n     successfully wound up with a public exhibition under the\r\n     shade trees in front of the pastor's residence on the hill\r\n     near the Milwaukee depot. The following young men were among\r\n     the students of that first school: George Weare, John Stony,\r\n     Cyrus E. Ferguson, Murry S. D. Davis, Amos Ferguson, Isaac\r\n     W. Carroll, Mortimer A. Higley, William E. Earl, William J.\r\n     Wood, Edwin Kennedy, George R. Carroll, James L. Bever, and\r\n     George W. Bever.\"\r\n\r\nWe also avail ourselves of an extract from the _Fortieth Anniversary\r\nFirst Presbyterian Church, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 1887_, on which occasion\r\nMr. Carroll in his biographical sketch of the Rev. Williston Jones, our\r\nfirst pastor, used the following language:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Jones was deeply interested in the subject of raising\r\n     up a native ministry. That is to say, he believed that it\r\n     was important that we should seek out young men from among\r\n     the people of the west to labor in the west. It was,\r\n     therefore, his constant aim wherever he met a Christian\r\n     young man of any promise, to lay before him the claims of\r\n     the gospel ministry, and urge him prayerfully to consider\r\n     the question as to whether or not God had called him to the\r\n     sacred office. This fact, of course, led him to take a great\r\n     interest in the subject of education. There were no schools\r\n     at that time where a young man could even begin a course of\r\n     study for the ministry. He felt the embarrassment of the\r\n     situation. He had at last found one young man who had\r\n     decided to study for the ministry, but there was no school\r\n     in Cedar Rapids where he could make a beginning of the study\r\n     of Latin or Greek or any of the higher branches of study. At\r\n     last he decided to undertake himself the task of preparing\r\n     that young man for college. In a short time, a dozen or\r\n     fifteen more, hearing of this arrangement, begged the\r\n     privilege of joining that lone student in studying under Mr.\r\n     Jones, and before he was aware of it, he found himself at\r\n     the head of a school for young men. This was in the autumn\r\n     of 1851. He had erected for himself, meantime, a house of\r\n     the same material of the old church, cement. It still stands\r\n     on the hill north of the Milwaukee depot. The parlor of that\r\n     house was at that time unfinished. It was lathed but not\r\n     plastered. Mr. Jones said to the young men, if they would\r\n     get one coat of plastering put onto that room, and put in\r\n     some temporary seats made of slabs, they could have the use\r\n     of it for a school room. The offer was promptly accepted,\r\n     and, in due time, the school began in good earnest. One of\r\n     the number would act as monitor in the school-room for a\r\n     week, and then another, until the honor had been enjoyed by\r\n     all. Mr. and Mrs. Jones were the first professors of the\r\n     institution, coming in at regular hours to hear recitations.\r\n     The branches of study pursued in the new academy were\r\n     reading, writing, geography, arithmetic, algebra, grammar,\r\n     Latin and Greek. Due attention was also given to\r\n     composition, declamation, and vocal music. For six months\r\n     that school continued in perfect harmony and marked success.\r\n     The term closed sometime in June, I think 1852, with public\r\n     exercises appropriate to the occasion. The place of meeting\r\n     was in a grove immediately in front of the school-room. The\r\n     order of exercises, as nearly as I can remember, consisted\r\n     in singing and prayer of course, recitations, reading of\r\n     essays, and declamations. Everything passed off pleasantly\r\n     and satisfactorily, and I believe the school was pronounced\r\n     a success. This effort convinced Mr. Jones more than ever of\r\n     the need of a permanent school of a higher order. He\r\n     therefore wrote on to Knox college, I think to Professor\r\n     Blanchard, to see if one of the graduates could not come and\r\n     take charge of the school. The result was that Mr. David\r\n     Blakely, then a recent graduate of Knox college, came in the\r\n     fall of 1852 and opened the school in the church. The school\r\n     then assumed the name of the Cedar Rapids Collegiate\r\n     Institute. Mr. Blakely held the position of principal of\r\n     that school for two years, and then resigned his position to\r\n     enter the active work of the gospel ministry, in which he is\r\n     still engaged. During all this time the school was kept up\r\n     with unabated interest, many students coming in from the\r\n     country round about, and several from remote parts of the\r\n     state. At least three of the members of that school entered\r\n     the ministry, and are still engaged in the active duties of\r\n     the sacred calling: one. Rev. Hiram Hill, in California;\r\n     another, Rev. William Campbell, in Kansas; and the third in\r\n     this state. It was during the spring of 1853, I think, that\r\n     Mr. Jones was sent as a commissioner to the General Assembly\r\n     (N. S.) which met in Buffalo, N. Y. During his absence the\r\n     school at home occupied his thoughts and called out all the\r\n     energies of his ardent nature. He determined if possible to\r\n     secure aid in the east by which to place the school upon a\r\n     permanent basis, having for its chief end the education of\r\n     indigent young men for the gospel ministry. He was not\r\n     disappointed in his purpose. Guided no doubt by an all-wise\r\n     Providence, he met Mr. Daniel Coe, who listened to his\r\n     earnest appeal, and gave him the money with which the eighty\r\n     acres of ground, where the college now stands, and these two\r\n     lots now occupied by this church and chapel, and a lot now\r\n     occupied by the M. E. church, were secured, Dr. J. F. Ely\r\n     making the purchase. You will see then, that out of the\r\n     little school, started in the first pastor's house, has\r\n     grown Coe college, and Rev. Williston Jones was its\r\n     founder.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. F. KING, LL. D. Long President Cornell College]\r\n\r\nIt can thus be easily seen that the yearning of Mr. Jones to see a\r\nschool provided in Cedar Rapids was a fire in his bones. And so, when\r\nin the providence of God, he was in attendance at a meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Presbyterian church (New School) which was held\r\nin May, 1853, in the city of Buffalo, N. Y., he sought to interest\r\neveryone whom he met in the cause of Christian education in the west.\r\nAt that same session of the General Assembly was a minister of the\r\nPresbyterian church from the Catskill mountain region of New York\r\nstate. He said to Mr. Jones, in substance. \"I cannot help you myself,\r\nbut I believe I know a man in my section of the country who can and\r\nwill, and if you come home with me to Durham, Greene county, New York,\r\nI will introduce you to him.\" The man alluded to was Mr. Daniel Coe, an\r\nelder of the church, already deeply interested in the cause of\r\nChristian education and preparing to help according to his ability when\r\nthe suitable opportunity was afforded.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones went to Durham and met Mr. Coe, and presenting to him the\r\nmatter nearest to his heart, the founding of a school of christian\r\nlearning in the new world beyond the Mississippi. Mr. Coe gladly\r\nconsented to assist in the enterprise. The sum promised, $1,500, would\r\nbe considered in these days a very meagre one, but in 1853, and in\r\nIowa, it must have seemed like $15,000 or more would seem now to us,\r\nand Mr. Jones must have welcomed the proffered aid with delight.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to his home in Cedar Rapids and to his brethren of the\r\nPresbytery of Iowa City, of which he was a member, he made such\r\nencouraging statements concerning the treatment he had received at the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and especially concerning the offer of Mr. Coe, that\r\nthere was formed in Cedar Rapids a corporation by the name of the Cedar\r\nRapids Collegiate Institute, which prepared articles and filed them for\r\nrecord August 9, 1853. All persons owning one share of stock each in\r\nthe Institute became thereby members of the corporation, each share of\r\nstock being of the value of $25.00. Article twelve of the fourteen\r\narticles of corporation reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Iowa City Presbytery in consideration of five scholarships for the\r\nfirst five years, and of ten scholarships thereafter, shall have the\r\nright to nominate all teachers of the Institute, subject, however, to\r\nconfirmation by the Board of Directors, but this right shall be\r\nforfeited if said consideration should at any time fail.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose from the records that this consideration\r\nwas ever fulfilled.\r\n\r\nArticle thirteen gives the names of the directors: Williston Jones,\r\nJohn F. Ely, W. W. Smith, Seymour D. Carpenter, Addison Daniels, Isaac\r\nCook, William Greene, John L. Shearer, and Aaron Van Dorn; and the\r\nfollowing persons as officers of the board: George Greene, president;\r\nSamson C. Bever, treasurer; David Blakely, secretary.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to note that of these persons there is one who\r\nsurvives to this day, Mr. W. W. Smith, who at a very advanced age still\r\nlives at Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of this board of directors was held July 18, 1853,\r\nand it was at that meeting that Mr. Jones presented the instrument of\r\nwriting signed by Daniel Coe, of the county of Greene, in the state of\r\nNew York, making a conditional donation to the Institute of the sum of\r\n$1,500, of which the following is a copy:\r\n\r\n\"CONDITIONAL DONATION TO CEDAR RAPIDS COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE\r\n\r\n     \"Know all men by these presents that I, Daniel Coe, of the\r\n     town of Durham, County of Greene, and State of New York, in\r\n     view of the educational wants of the great and growing West,\r\n     and in expectation of its resulting in the establishment of\r\n     a permanent institution of learning, do hereby engage to\r\n     give in behalf of Iowa City Presbytery, connected with the\r\n     constitutional General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church\r\n     which met at Buffalo, May 19th, 1853, to Cedar Rapids\r\n     Collegiate Institute the following sums for the object\r\n     hereinafter specified, to-wit: Four Hundred and twenty-five\r\n     Dollars ($425.00) for the purchase of as large and suitable\r\n     tract of land as practicable as a site for the location of\r\n     the institute. And Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) for fencing\r\n     of the same. Also One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00) to be\r\n     appropriated in the best manner for a farm contiguous to the\r\n     site, the avails of which are to be appropriated to the best\r\n     advantage for the benefit of such students as may need to\r\n     assist themselves by manual labor. Of these two sums the\r\n     first mentioned, consisting of Five Hundred Dollars\r\n     ($500.00), can be secured to the Institute as a part of its\r\n     property by the erection upon its site thus purchased of a\r\n     building costing at least Two Thousand Dollars ($2000.00),\r\n     and the last mentioned One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00) can\r\n     be thus secured by bringing the Institute into successful\r\n     operation. _Provided_ that if these conditions fail, or if\r\n     the Institute be removed or diverted from its original\r\n     design, either or both of these donations shall be\r\n     forfeited, and the land purchased shall revert back to the\r\n     said Daniel Coe, his heirs, executors, or administrators.\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. John F. Ely, Hon. George Greene, Dr. S. D. Carpenter,\r\n     Isaac Cook, Esq., James Ferguson, and Williston Jones are\r\n     hereby authorized to act for me in the selection and\r\n     purchasing for said Institute the above mentioned site and\r\n     farm, and are to draw on me for the money; of which sum\r\n     Seven Hundred Dollars ($700.00) can be drawn at any time,\r\n     and the remaining Eight Hundred Dollars ($800.00) one year\r\n     from the date of this engagement.\r\n\r\n     \"It is my strong desire that this Institute should be made\r\n     available for the education of females as well as males.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evidently to be seen that it was the purpose of Mr. Coe to enable\r\nthe directors of the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute to maintain a\r\nschool of learning to be conducted in a building within easy access to\r\nthe town, and at the same time aid such students as needed assistance\r\nthrough the products of the farm purchased on the edge of the town.\r\nSteps were taken at once to procure two sites, one for the school\r\nbuilding, the other for the farm. And after considerable inquiry and\r\ndebate, two sites were chosen and purchased: the one for the school\r\nbuilding consisting of the two lots on which the First Presbyterian\r\nchurch of this city now stands and has stood since 1869; the other for\r\nthe farm, consisting of a plot of eighty acres, of which the present\r\ncampus of Coe College of ten acres, is the southwestern extremity.\r\n\r\nThe town lots were purchased for $275.00. The eighty acres were bought\r\nfor $1000.00. These eighty acres were obtained from Mr. Otho S. Bowling\r\nby Dr. John F. Ely, who bought them with Mr. Coe's money for the Cedar\r\nRapids Collegiate Institute. The date of the purchase is December 5,\r\n1853. Mr. Bowling had obtained the land at the price of $820.00 from\r\nthe executors of the estate of Mr. Joshua Phillips, of Franklin county,\r\nPennsylvania. Mr. Phillips had died at his residence in Pennsylvania\r\nat some time between the 15th of December, 1852, and the 4th of\r\nJanuary, 1853, and he had himself obtained the property in Cedar Rapids\r\nby patent from the United States government May 1, 1848. So that the\r\nplot of ground which figures in such a vital manner in the history of\r\nCoe College had passed through but two hands before being transferred\r\nto the Collegiate Institute from the government which had obtained it\r\nfrom the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt has also appeared that it was the wish of Mr. Coe and the design of\r\nthe directors of the school that the building to cost $2000.00 should\r\nbe erected as soon as practicable upon the town lots. But the erection\r\nof this building was delayed for various causes and especially in\r\nconsequence of the lack of funds. Meanwhile, a school of very\r\nelementary character was maintained in the building used as their house\r\nof worship by the First Presbyterian church, and Mr. David Blakely was\r\nobtained as principal at a salary of $400.00 per annum, payable\r\nquarterly.\r\n\r\nAs time went on it was found to be more difficult than seemed probable\r\nin the beginning, to obtain subscriptions for the erection of the\r\nbuilding of a school of just the character that seemed within the\r\nfeeble means of the directors. And it became even more difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to maintain the school in the building occupied by the\r\nPresbyterian church. For it would appear that this community of Cedar\r\nRapids was in process of organizing a general public school system, and\r\nno place seemed to exist for a parochial school of the elementary\r\ncharacter that was then being conducted by the Cedar Rapids Collegiate\r\nInstitute, at least in so small a community and one so feebly provided\r\nwith material funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, through the want of proper sustenance, everyone connected\r\nwith the Institute and notably the principal upon whom the chief burden\r\nfell became wholly discouraged and the Presbytery of Iowa City, that\r\nhad a certain relationship to the school and interest in its success,\r\nproposed to put the school on wheels and offer it to the highest\r\nbidder, naming several localities among which were: Vinton, Waterloo,\r\nLyons, Cedar Falls, Newton, and Iowa City.[M]\r\n\r\nIt will surely be of interest to learn [See _Minutes Iowa City\r\nPresbytery_, Mt. Vernon, February 4, 1857] that the citizens and\r\nproprietors of Comanche offered a site and subscriptions to the amount\r\nof $10,000, or $200.00 more than any other town, for the location of\r\nthe Collegiate Institute of the Presbytery. Vinton also made a strong\r\nbid for the school and hoped to capture it, and might have done so had\r\nit not been that the eighty acre plot of ground, which was the only\r\nfinancial asset of the institution, was securely fastened down in Cedar\r\nRapids, and Mr. Coe hesitated as to the propositions for the removal of\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\nBut these internal and external discussions acted in a very unfavorable\r\nmanner upon the Institute, and led to the winding up of its affairs,\r\nfor there is no record of any meeting of its board of directors\r\nsubsequent to July 26, 1859.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a new star of hope arose in the heavens, and for several\r\nyears at least it was a star of considerable brilliancy. It was made\r\nknown, namely, that the will of Mr. Lewis Baldwin Parsons, a benefactor\r\nand philanthropist, and who died in Detroit, Michigan, December 21,\r\n1855, after a successful life as a manufacturer in Buffalo, N. Y.,\r\ncontained a bequest setting aside a very considerable amount of money\r\nto found a Presbyterian college in Iowa. It could not be a matter of\r\nsurprise, therefore, that the brethren in Cedar Rapids, who had\r\nstruggled so hard to found a college with Mr. Coe's donation, and who\r\nhad been so sorely disappointed, should now with enthusiasm welcome the\r\nthought that the Parsons legacy might be located here and be added to\r\nthe Coe donation, and thus become the foundation of a strong college in\r\nIowa in connection with the Presbyterian church. Accordingly, steps\r\nwere taken to incorporate a new body of stockholders into an\r\norganization to be known as Parsons Seminary. The date of the first\r\nmeeting with this end in view is November 10, 1866, and the following\r\npersons were chosen to serve as officers until the annual meeting in\r\nDecember: Rev. James Knox, president; Hon. George Greene,\r\nvice-president; Dr. John F. Ely, secretary; and Mr. S. C. Bever,\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting, December 3, 1866, the following officers were\r\nchosen: George Greene, president; James Knox, vice-president; John F.\r\nEly, secretary; W. W. Walker, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved immediately that Mr. Coe should be requested to deed to\r\nthe new organization the eighty acres of land already donated by him to\r\nthe Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute, and at a meeting of the board of\r\ntrustees of Parsons Seminary, held January 4, 1867, Judge Greene,\r\npresident of the board, reported that he had visited Mr. Daniel Coe at\r\nhis home in Durham, N. Y., and had procured from him the deed to\r\nParsons Seminary of the land in question.\r\n\r\nThis most generous act of Mr. Coe reveals the large and unselfish\r\ncharacter of the man and declares the nobility of his motive to promote\r\nthe cause of high christian education in the west.\r\n\r\nThis act of Mr. Coe also gave great encouragement to the board of\r\ntrustees of the seminary to proceed in their work, and they proceeded\r\nvigorously to raise what must in those days have been a considerable\r\nsum of money, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for\r\ncollege purposes upon the edge of the eighty acre plot nearest to the\r\ntown. The two town lots which had originally been purchased for the\r\nlocation of the school building were sold to the trustees of the First\r\nPresbyterian church, to become the site of a house of worship, which\r\nbuilding was erected by them in 1869, and still stands a substantial\r\nedifice of stone, facing the public square long known as Washington\r\nPark, now George Greene Square.\r\n\r\nThe ways and means and plans for this new building occupied the\r\nattention of the board for many meetings during the years 1867 and\r\n1868, and the work was pushed with all vigor to enable the trustees to\r\nopen their seminary in the new building in the fall of 1868.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the school work was inaugurated, pending the erection of the\r\nbuilding on the college grounds, in the Wadsworth block, a row of\r\nunpretentious buildings resembling a barracks, on Second street and\r\nFifth avenue, in the school year 1867-8. The principal of this school\r\nwas the Rev. A. B. Goodale, a Presbyterian clergyman who survived in\r\nsouthern California until a few years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles J. Deacon, our highly esteemed and greatly respected fellow\r\ncitizen, who has spent a long and useful life among us, as an attorney,\r\nand who has been for several years a most valuable trustee of Coe\r\nCollege, was one of the first students of Parsons Seminary, and he has\r\nfurnished us the following reminiscences which we gladly incorporate in\r\nthis historical sketch:\r\n\r\n     \"I came to Cedar Rapids and enrolled as a student in Parsons\r\n     Seminary early in September, 1868. The school had been in\r\n     progress under that name for a year previous, but then for\r\n     the first time entered into the new building, now the west\r\n     half of the main building of Coe college. This school was\r\n     then prosperous and the body of students very enthusiastic.\r\n     Dr. A. B. Goodale was the principal and Prof. Augustus\r\n     Maasburg was the professor of Latin, Greek, French, and\r\n     German. Miss A. D. Kelsey, a graduate of Mt. Holyoke, and a\r\n     most estimable lady, had charge of the primary department,\r\n     and also taught many of the classes in mathematics, and had\r\n     charge of the botany class. Miss Lindsay, a sister of Mrs.\r\n     Goodale, taught painting and drawing. A few weeks after the\r\n     school opened, Professor and Madame Masurier came, and\r\n     Professor Masurier took charge of the music, and Mme.\r\n     Masurier was given the care of the French class. I remember\r\n     also that Miss Addie Goodell, now Mrs. Birdsall, of Lake\r\n     City, Iowa, was a student in the seminary, and it became\r\n     necessary to have an assistant in the primary department,\r\n     and she was employed in that capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN STREET FROM THE NORTH, FAIRFAX]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN STREET LOOKING WEST, CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\n     \"At the beginning of the year 1868-1869 the school numbered\r\n     over one hundred students. They were, of course, largely\r\n     from the city of Cedar Rapids, but they came also from the\r\n     surrounding towns of Fairfax, Springville, Center Point,\r\n     Central City, and some from the farms within a few miles of\r\n     the city. They came also from Vinton and Marengo, and some\r\n     from more distant portions of the state, and I remember two\r\n     from the state of Illinois, and one from Nebraska.\r\n\r\n     \"The school year was divided into four terms of ten weeks\r\n     each, the tuition being $7.50 per term. I remember there was\r\n     some falling off in the attendance at the close of the\r\n     second term in mid-winter. In the spring we were told that\r\n     Dr. Goodale would have an assistant in the person of Mr. J.\r\n     W. Stephens. When he came he was introduced to us by Dr.\r\n     Goodale as his assistant, but it soon developed that he was\r\n     the principal of the seminary, Doctor Goodale having about\r\n     that time accepted the pastorate of the Presbyterian church\r\n     at Marshalltown. The attendance at the spring term under the\r\n     conduct of Dr. Stephens was much smaller than in the fall,\r\n     but the school continued until the 20th of June, when it\r\n     closed for the summer vacation. It issued a catalogue as it\r\n     had the previous year and announced the opening for the\r\n     following September.\r\n\r\n     \"I returned to the school in the fall when it opened for the\r\n     third year, being the second year in the new building, and\r\n     found many of the old students. The school, however, was\r\n     much smaller than at the opening of the previous year. It\r\n     also dwindled very much during the year, and when we closed\r\n     in June, 1870, my recollection is that it numbered about\r\n     forty students. Mr. Stephens announced that it would be\r\n     continued, however, and the school opened again in the\r\n     September following. I did not return to the school, but\r\n     went to the State University of Iowa. Mr. Stephens continued\r\n     the school until the following spring, and then closed it.\r\n     [We understand that Mr. Stephens is still living in\r\n     connection with Park College, Mo.]\r\n\r\n     \"One thing that is quite clearly impressed upon my memory is\r\n     the meeting of the Synod of Iowa, North, in this city in the\r\n     late winter or early spring of 1869. The application of the\r\n     Parsons legacy and the endowment of the college was then a\r\n     very prominent question in Presbyterian circles. Cedar\r\n     Rapids was a most prominent applicant for the location of\r\n     the college to be thus endowed, and the seminary had been\r\n     named Parsons Seminary with a view to attracting that legacy\r\n     here. A large representation of the synod visited the\r\n     college at the time I speak of and addressed the students.\r\n     Amongst others, I remember Doctor Spees, then of Dubuque;\r\n     the Rev. Samuel Howe, and Mr. Alexander Danskin, of Marengo.\r\n     They said to us that we were now a college, that whereas\r\n     yesterday we were a seminary, today we were a college. There\r\n     was much enthusiasm manifested among us by this statement,\r\n     and we all felt satisfied that the matter had been\r\n     practically settled. Subsequent facts proved that their\r\n     statement was a little premature.\r\n\r\n     \"Another thing that comes to my recollection is the visit of\r\n     the committee to locate the Parsons legacy in the spring of\r\n     1870. This committee was headed by Doctor Craig, then pastor\r\n     of the church at Keokuk, now of McCormick Seminary, Chicago.\r\n     The committee made a very thorough examination of the\r\n     buildings and of the grounds and of the location generally.\r\n     I distinctly recall their walking over the grounds. The\r\n     trustees of the seminary, being informed in advance of the\r\n     coming of this committee, were preparing to create a good\r\n     impression. A few days before their expected arrival, the\r\n     ground, which had been leveled off in front of the college,\r\n     and which consisted of coarse sand, was ornamented by some\r\n     fifty or sixty evergreen trees, and a large amount of black\r\n     dirt was hauled in upon the sand with the expectation of\r\n     spreading it over the sand to present a surface of good soil\r\n     with a large number of evergreen trees set out in an\r\n     ornamental order. Unfortunately, however, the committee\r\n     arrived earlier than was anticipated and the black dirt had\r\n     not been spread over the sand. To render the situation still\r\n     worse, a high wind was blowing the day the committee were\r\n     here and the sand was drifting over the dirt piles and\r\n     filling up against the lower board of the fence. What the\r\n     effect of this was upon the committee I have no means of\r\n     judging. It is, however, interesting to notice that the\r\n     Parsons legacy never came to Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\n     \"I could mention many names of Cedar Rapids citizens who as\r\n     boys attended school at Parsons Seminary during those early\r\n     years. Mr. C. C. Greene, Mr. John S. Ely, Mr. George B.\r\n     Douglas, were all there with me. Mr. George W. Winn, also a\r\n     trustee, used to go there for private lessons in German from\r\n     Professor Maasburg. Mr. C. L. Miller, of the _Gazette_,\r\n     Emery and Harry Brown, and Elmer Higley are names that also\r\n     occur to me readily. I could mention, likewise, many ladies\r\n     who studied there in those early years. The Rev. Alexander\r\n     Danskin, editor of one of our church papers at Detroit,\r\n     Michigan, was a student there at that time, afterwards\r\n     graduating from Wabash College; also the Rev. R. M. L.\r\n     Braden, who likewise went to Wabash College.\r\n\r\n     \"These are a few of the things that come to my mind as I\r\n     review my two years in Parsons Seminary.\"\r\n\r\nIt can easily be read between the lines of Mr. Deacon's reminiscences\r\nthat Parsons Seminary, however enthusiastic its support was at the\r\nbeginning, did not continue by any means to be an entire success. We\r\nmust look for the explanation of this very largely to its lack of\r\nfinancial resources. It was living largely on hopes, and hopes that\r\nwere not destined to be realized. Mr. Coe's donation, lying in the\r\neighty acres of land, was utterly unproductive of a revenue, and the\r\nParsons legacy, which consisted of four thousand acres of wild lands in\r\nvarious counties in Iowa, had not yet been located in Cedar Rapids, but\r\nwas hovering in the air as a glittering object which several localities\r\nin the state were reaching out to obtain.\r\n\r\nIt would be an interesting and instructive pursuit to trace the history\r\nof this legacy both within the Presbyterian synod of Iowa and within\r\nthe various cities of the state which made bids for its attainment. The\r\nstory, as far as Cedar Rapids is concerned, is one of bright hopes,\r\nearnest aspiration, valiant endeavor and achievement, to be followed by\r\nsevere disappointment and bitter regret. The citizens of this city went\r\nheroically to work to raise the sum of $75,000 to be subscribed and\r\nadded to the Parsons legacy [then estimated to be of the value of\r\n$50,000], and this again to be added to the Coe donation of eighty\r\nacres of land, which were continually increasing in value through the\r\ngrowth of the city of Cedar Rapids. These three sums, when added\r\ntogether, would furnish, it was intelligently felt, a very substantial\r\nendowment as the beginning of a college. We have often been told that\r\nwhen this campaign for the raising of the $75,000 had been successfully\r\ncompleted, there was such a general jubilee in our city that\r\ninstinctively in demonstration thereof the whistles of the locomotives\r\nand manufacturing establishments were merrily blown. But all these\r\nplans went agley. Although committees from the synods of Iowa had\r\npresented unanimous reports recommending that the Parsons legacy be\r\nlocated at Cedar Rapids, it was eventually taken to Fairfield to found\r\nParsons College. The fund of $75,000 which was raised in Cedar Rapids\r\nfell to the ground because of the failure to meet its vital condition\r\nof the bringing of the Parsons legacy here, and so, once more, all that\r\nwas left for us was Mr. Coe's donation of the eighty acre plot and the\r\nindomitable spirit of a few of the citizens of Cedar Rapids to plant in\r\nour city an institution of higher learning in connection with the\r\nPresbyterian church.\r\n\r\nIt is idle at this late date to discuss the wisdom or the folly of\r\nthose men in the synod who were responsible for this result. It were\r\nwholly unproductive to speculate what might have been accomplished by\r\nthe union of all our educational forces here in Cedar Rapids. What is\r\nwritten is written, what is done is an accomplished fact. Presbyterians\r\nare not in the habit of quarreling with Divine Providence, but are the\r\nrather given to rejoicing in the sovereignty of God. It is quite\r\nconceivable that results already visible can give occasion for\r\ngratitude that we have now the two colleges, Coe and Parsons, instead\r\nof but one, as was once so ardently hoped for here at Cedar Rapids. If\r\nanyone in the years between 1870 and 1873 made an error in judgment in\r\nobjecting to the merger, the only way to rectify it now is by pressing\r\nall the more for the promoting of the endowment and the buildings of\r\nboth the colleges, the one at Fairfield, and the one at Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nBut the facts are that through the force of circumstances, the school\r\nat Cedar Rapids was obliged to suspend its work, and little or nothing\r\nwas done in the building erected in 1868 from 1871 to 1875. Then for\r\nthe third time, and under new auspices, was the work begun afresh, and\r\nit took place on this wise: On the 26th of April, 1875, the trustees of\r\nParsons Seminary held a meeting, at which meeting a committee of the\r\nPresbytery of Cedar Rapids was present for the purpose of consulting\r\nwith the board to the end that the seminary building and the Coe legacy\r\nlocated at Cedar Rapids might be made available for the establishment\r\nof a school of a high order under the care of the said Presbytery. This\r\ncommittee had been appointed by the Presbytery at its session at\r\nAnamosa April 24, 1875, and they presented to the board of trustees of\r\nParsons Seminary a formal report in writing, which expressed the\r\nreadiness of the Presbytery to undertake the care of the school at\r\nCedar Rapids on condition that all its debts be cancelled, and its\r\ncharter be so amended as to give to the Presbytery the power to appoint\r\nits board of trustees. The Presbytery also pledged itself to do all in\r\nits power to maintain the school and open it in the school building by\r\nthe 1st of October, 1875. The board of trustees consented to the\r\nproposition of the Presbytery and resolved to change the name of the\r\ninstitution from Parsons Seminary to Coe Collegiate Institute. The\r\narticles of incorporation of Parsons Seminary, which had been adopted\r\nOctober 30, 1866, were amended May 11, 1875, to meet the new\r\nconditions. The board of trustees was fixed at the number of eighteen,\r\nand the power to elect them was vested in the Presbytery of Cedar\r\nRapids, or in the synod of Iowa North, if the said synod shall assume\r\nsuch power with the consent of said Presbytery. The first election was\r\nappointed to take place in the fall of the year 1876.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel Coe had passed from earth in the interval between December\r\n23, 1866, when he deeded the eighty acres of land in Cedar Rapids to\r\nParsons Seminary, and this date in 1875, when these new relations with\r\nthe seminary were entered into. He left a daughter, an only child, who\r\nhad become the wife of Mr. J. E. Jewell. This daughter, Mr. Coe's sole\r\nheir at law, with her husband, entered in a very friendly manner and\r\nmeasure into the new plans of the institution, and nobly agreed to\r\npermit the school to avail itself under certain conditions well\r\nunderstood and agreed to, of the advantages accruing from the revenues\r\nof the property.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, 1875, it was announced at a meeting of the\r\ntrustees of Coe Collegiate Institute that correspondence had been\r\nconducted with the Rev. R. A. Condit with a view to his being made\r\nprincipal of the school. Mr. Condit was then elected to that office.\r\nThis event marks the entrance into the work of Coe College of a\r\npersonality of rare value in himself and of rare value to the\r\ninstitution of learning which he served most faithfully for a period of\r\nthirty years after his appointment in 1875. Robert Aaron Condit was a\r\nman of sweet spirit and gentle demeanor; he was a Christian and a\r\nscholar. No one ever doubted his piety or his moral integrity. The\r\nstudents who for a whole generation passed under his care all loved him\r\nbecause he loved them, and was himself so lovable. His influence upon\r\nthem was mild, but effective, and we venture to say without fear of\r\ncontradiction, that all the alumni of Coe College who knew him as their\r\npreceptor recognize the fact with gratitude that they are better\r\npersons for having known him. In the weak and struggling days of Coe\r\nCollegiate Institute before it emerged into its present larger,\r\nstronger growth, as Coe College, Robert Condit was a factor peculiarly\r\nfitted for the task providentially laid upon him, and his full value to\r\nthe college can scarcely be over-estimated or even stated sufficiently.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of March, 1876, Prof. J. W. McLaury was employed to assist\r\nMr. Condit in the school, his salary being raised by voluntary\r\nsubscriptions. Mr. McLaury's services, though valuable, were not long\r\nretained by the institution.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the board held December 28, 1876, the report of the\r\nelection of the trustees by the Presbytery October 4, 1876, was made,\r\nas directed by the charter. And at the same meeting the following\r\nofficers of the board were chosen: Hon. George Greene, president;\r\nThomas M. Sinclair, vice president; D. W. C. Rowley, secretary; George\r\nW. Winn, treasurer. It was at this meeting that the present writer took\r\nhis seat with his brethren for the first time as an officially\r\naccredited member of the board. And it is a matter of grateful, tender\r\nrecollection to him, that he has remained to this day in unbroken\r\nrelation with the institution in all possible varieties of official\r\nposition and duties upon its manifold committees. And it is a solemn\r\nrecollection with him that he alone remains on the board of all those\r\nwho have served with him for thirty-four years.\r\n\r\nHe can well remember the tone and atmosphere of the meetings of the\r\nboard, which he was then called upon to attend. It was truly a day of\r\nsmall things. The meetings were frequent and they were often lengthy,\r\nand we must truly say they were usually dreary, and we went from them\r\nwith depressed hearts. For the questions for discussion were mostly,\r\nnot how to promote high christian learning, but how to pay the debts of\r\nParsons Seminary. And the problem was, how to pay something with\r\nnothing. There were notes at two of the leading banks of the city,\r\nnotes which were increasing fearfully by the compounding of interest at\r\nten per cent, and there were notes held by individuals who had loaned\r\nmoney to the seminary, there were mechanic's liens of sums unpaid in\r\nthe erection of the building put up in 1867-8, and to meet these\r\nobligations there was nothing in sight. For all moneys that found their\r\nway into the treasury were needed, and more than needed, to pay current\r\nbills to teachers, heating and lighting bills and such minor fees. We\r\nremember that our treasurer was once garnisheed by the brother of one\r\nof our teachers for the payment of his sister's salary, and some sort\r\nof compromise settlement was effected.\r\n\r\nWe have not a thought or word of disparagement concerning any member of\r\nthe board at that time. But it would have required men of heroic mold\r\nand prophetic vision to face those problems. The president of the\r\nboard, the Hon. George Greene, a name never to be mentioned in this\r\ncity without a tribute of respect, was deeply immersed in his own\r\nprivate interests and was compelled to be absent from home a great part\r\nof the time. Soon after the date of which we speak, he insisted upon\r\npressing his resignation as president of the board. Other prominent\r\nbusiness and professional men on the board were also engrossed in large\r\npersonal interests. The ministers on the board, however valuable though\r\nthey may have been for counsel concerning educational questions, were\r\nquite helpless in grappling with the financial problems which from\r\nnecessity were uppermost.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Knox had passed from earth October 10, 1875, after\r\nhaving contributed valuable services to the college during the eleven\r\nyears of his pastorate in this city. We here insert the following\r\ntribute to Mr. Knox, which was presented at a meeting of the board of\r\ntrustees March 8, 1876, and was adopted, all the members present\r\nstanding:\r\n\r\n     \"In the providence of God the Rev. James Knox, former vice\r\n     president of this board, having been removed by death we\r\n     take this opportunity to record our testimony to his\r\n     exceeding worth as a man and his wisdom and faithfulness as\r\n     a minister of the gospel, and to his great devotion and\r\n     usefulness to this institution, having been connected with\r\n     it from its earliest days, and having given to it his best\r\n     strength and ability for many years, and his very latest\r\n     prayers. We feel that his place cannot easily be filled and\r\n     that in him the college has lost one of its truest and best\r\n     friends.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD GRAVE AT SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. J. B. ALBROOK, D. D.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROF. HARRIETTE J. COOK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. MARGARET McKELL KING]\r\n\r\nThere was one notable exception to all these. One personality stands\r\nout from the midst of his brethren and to him more than to any other\r\nelement at this critical period of the history of Coe College do we\r\nattribute the fact that we have a college today, and one with such\r\npromise and potency. We refer to Mr. Thomas M. Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair\r\nhad come to Cedar Rapids in 1871 a young man not quite thirty years of\r\nage. He was pursuing a large manufacturing business, that of pork\r\npacking, with rare energy and intelligence, and with great success. He\r\nwas making money, and his great desire and single aim was to use this\r\nmoney with a keen sense of responsibility to God and usefulness to his\r\nfellow men. He was a man of rare christian character, one among ten\r\nthousand. It may truly be said of him that he walked with God. Coming\r\ninto this young country from the older world, he took a most keenly\r\nactive interest in all things that pertained to its welfare, and it was\r\na fortunate thing for Coe College that he came to Cedar Rapids at such\r\na time as he did. The cause of christian education was one of his most\r\ntreasured conceptions of opportunity, and he identified himself with\r\nthe representative of that cause which he providentially found to his\r\nhand in this struggling institution.\r\n\r\nSeeing the imperative need of relief from debt which Coe Collegiate\r\nInstitute manifested, he determined in the nobility of his heart that\r\nhe would pay out of his own pocket such obligations, principal and\r\ninterest, as lay against the institution, although they amounted to\r\nseveral thousand dollars. And this he gladly did in all such cases as\r\nhe could not induce those who owned these obligations to cancel them\r\nthemselves. And thus it came about one happy day that he could declare\r\nthe college was actually free from all such incumbrances. Then he and\r\nseveral of his colleagues, inspired with new hope and courage, and\r\ndetermined to launch the institution upon broader and deeper waters,\r\nwent before the synod of Iowa North, which met at Waterloo, Iowa, in\r\nOctober, 1880, and asked the synod to assume the care and control of\r\nthe Institute, free from debt, and possessed of a building, and of\r\neighty acres of land in the city of Cedar Rapids. The synod accepted\r\nthe proposition, and steps were taken at once to frame articles of\r\nincorporation of a new organization to be called Coe College. The\r\narticles were filed for record on the 16th day of April, 1881. Proper\r\ndeeds were drawn and filed for record which conveyed to Coe College all\r\nthe properties owned by Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute, Parsons\r\nSeminary, and Coe Collegiate Institute, and thus the line of\r\ninheritance and descent was duly established. In these negotiations\r\nrelating to the transference of the property through the hands of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Jewell, negotiations which required great care in the\r\nhandling, the valuable services of Mr. A. V. Eastman should be\r\nmentioned. Mr. Eastman served the college most valuably for several\r\nyears at this period as its secretary. He subsequently removed from\r\nCedar Rapids to St. Paul, Minn., and still later to St. Charles, La.,\r\nwhere he died most suddenly several years ago.\r\n\r\nWe have now emerged with our history from the intricacies of a somewhat\r\ntortuous channel, and we have passed out from shoals and shallows to\r\nenter upon clearer, deeper, broader waters. Henceforth we are to pursue\r\nthe story of the institution known as Coe College, which, with devious\r\nfortunes, but with perceptibly increasing volume, has been filling its\r\nplace and doing its work under the charter prepared in 1881. Certain\r\nchanges have been made to this charter, more or less important, but\r\nCoe College is the same institution, conducted by the same\r\nincorporation from 1881 to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe first item which we are called upon to record at this period of the\r\nhistory of our college, is the lamentable death of Mr. Thomas M.\r\nSinclair, which occurred on the 24th day of March, 1881. The\r\ncircumstances were peculiarly startling. By an accident he fell through\r\nan open hatchway in his own packing house and never recovered\r\nconsciousness, although he continued to breathe for several hours. We\r\ncan never forget our emotions over this event. It was truly an\r\ninscrutable Providence. Mr. Sinclair was at that time a young man, full\r\nof vigor and energy. He was a pillar of strength upon whom many leaned.\r\nHe had done so much to bring the college up to this point of its new\r\nbeginning that both he and we were looking forward with desire and\r\ndelight to what might be accomplished through his co-operation. But it\r\nwas willed otherwise. We cannot interpret the event, but may we not\r\neven now at this comparatively far removed time from its occurrence use\r\nit in memory of him for the greater glory of God and increase of the\r\ncollege. \"He being dead, yet speaketh.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Stephen Phelps, then the pastor of the Presbyterian church at\r\nVinton, had been very prominently connected with the college ever since\r\nits reconstruction as Coe Collegiate Institute in 1875. And now, when\r\nit became Coe College, under the care of the synod, he was invited to\r\nbecome its president. He was by nature and grace a pastor greatly\r\nbeloved by his people, and very useful in the community at Vinton. It\r\nwas a great request to make of him to ask him to lay down his pastoral\r\noffice and undertake the new and untried work of a college president.\r\nAnd this was made especially significant because he was asked to\r\npreside not over an institution already well endowed, richly equipped\r\nwith buildings, and possessed of the prestige of a generation, but over\r\nan institution still in the process of formation, without any endowment\r\nor equipment or faculty or history. He paused to consider his duty, and\r\ndecided to come to the college and with the help of God to undertake\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of many gifts; an eloquent preacher and lovable pastor who\r\nattracted young people to him, and a man of consecration and singleness\r\nof aim. His pure spirit and untiring energy were rewarded with much\r\nsuccess in spite of the many difficulties which resulted from the\r\nlimitations of the new situation. He remained in the presidency of the\r\ncollege six years, when he resigned his office to go back to his loved\r\nwork in the pastorate, to which he felt called of God. He became the\r\npastor of the Presbyterian church at Council Bluffs, and has\r\nsubsequently served other churches, until at the present time he is in\r\ncharge of the church at Bellevue, Nebraska, where he lives enjoying the\r\nrespect and affection of all who know him. He will ever be cherished as\r\nthe first president of Coe College.\r\n\r\nAnother figure that rises very prominently and pleasantly before us, as\r\nwe go back to this period of our history, is that of the first\r\ntreasurer of Coe College, Mr. John C. Broeksmit. Mr. Broeksmit became\r\nthe treasurer of Coe Collegiate Institute in 1878, and passed on into\r\nthe new administration in 1881, and continued in the exercise of his\r\nduties as treasurer until he was made treasurer emeritus in 1903, when\r\nMr. John M. Dinwiddie, our present very efficient treasurer, assumed\r\nthe duties of the office which Mr. Broeksmit laid down. In the\r\nformative period of our college history it was very important that the\r\ncharge of our slender funds should be placed in hands which were\r\ntrustworthy, not only because of honesty, but also because of business\r\nability and experience. Mr. Broeksmit possessed ideal qualities for a\r\ntreasurer. As auditor of the B., C. R. & N. R. R. he was accustomed to\r\nthe handling and careful accounting of the funds of that corporation,\r\nand he brought his knowledge, judgment, and integrity to bear upon the\r\nfinancial affairs of the college. We always felt secure in placing\r\nthese affairs in his hands, and we were not disappointed. Besides his\r\nservices as treasurer, he also rendered valuable services as a\r\ntrustee, always faithful in attendance, and giving his full and entire\r\ninterest to the matters in hand; wise in counsel, kind and genial in\r\nmanner, and friendly in attitude, he was a peculiarly attractive\r\nco-laborer. He should be written down as one who loved his fellow men.\r\nHis decease in March, 1907, at the age of 82, was universally lamented.\r\n\r\nWe note the fact that Williston Hall was completed as a boarding hall\r\nand dormitory for young ladies in 1881-1882, and the college building,\r\nwhich had been occupied more or less since September, 1868, for school\r\nroom purposes, was enlarged in 1884 by an addition which simply\r\nduplicated the original building.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the Rev. E. H. Avery, D. D., who had succeeded Dr. Phelps in\r\nthe pastoral charge at Vinton when Dr. Phelps came to Cedar Rapids to\r\nbe president of Coe College, came into the board of trustees, and was\r\nelected president of the board. He remained in this office until 1899,\r\nwhen he removed to California where he subsequently died. Dr. Avery's\r\nlong administration of seventeen years was marked by his qualities of\r\ncool, calm judgment, enlightened understanding, and zealous attention\r\nto educational interests. He was punctual in attendance at the many\r\nmeetings of the board, and of the executive committee, coming down from\r\nVinton many times at much sacrifice of personal comfort and the laying\r\naside of his pastoral work, and during that long and eventful period,\r\nmarked by so many changes from 1882-1899, it was fortunate that we had\r\nso wise and safe a president of our board as Eugene H. Avery.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, 1887, the Rev. James Marshall, D. D., was elected\r\npresident of the College to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation\r\nof Dr. Phelps. Dr. Marshall was an alumnus of Yale University and had\r\nspent several years in New York City in city missionary work. He\r\nentered upon the duties of his office in September, 1887. He brought\r\nwith him to these duties a mind matured and well rounded, a culture\r\nproduced by wide reading and considerable foreign travel and residence,\r\nand an intelligent appreciation of college work. He had a strong sense\r\nof the value of discipline in college life. He was much assisted by his\r\ncultured wife, whose attractive personality won for her a valued place\r\nin the hearts of the students. Mrs. Marshall died in Cedar Rapids after\r\na brief illness in November, 1892, leaving her husband sadly alone, for\r\nthere were no children in the household. Dr. Marshall labored on\r\nbravely in his work until September, 1896, when, just at the opening of\r\nthe college year, he was stricken down with pneumonia, and his death\r\noccurred after a few days amidst circumstances of peculiar solitude.\r\nHis funeral services were conducted at the First Presbyterian church of\r\nthis city, September 13, 1896, and the address on that occasion was\r\ngiven by Dr. J. Milton Greene, then of Ft. Dodge, Iowa, now of Havana,\r\nCuba, and a life long friend of the deceased. Dr. Marshall is the only\r\none of the presidents of our college who has departed this life, and he\r\ndied literally in the harness. In summing up his life and work we avail\r\nourselves of the words which it was our privilege to report to the\r\nboard at their meeting October 13, 1896:\r\n\r\n     \"He was a man of power, the power that is born of the\r\n     possession of a high ideal and consecrated purpose and\r\n     unusual faculty to organize, and an unflagging zeal to\r\n     execute and perform. He never spared himself. He forgot\r\n     himself, but he never forgot the college. His works do\r\n     follow him. These works which remain with us are the strong\r\n     and united faculty which he organized, and which he inspired\r\n     with his own high ideals, the noble standard of scholarship\r\n     to which he elevated the curriculum, the beautiful campus,\r\n     which is a wonder of improvement when we contrast it with\r\n     what it was when his hands first touched it, and the example\r\n     of industry and energy which his life has furnished. It\r\n     seems pathetic that he should have passed away without\r\n     seeing the fulfillment of the hopes he so dearly cherished,\r\n     and the plans be so wisely formulated. But it is a common\r\n     thing in this world that one should sow and another reap.\r\n     One conceives the building of the house, but leaves it to\r\n     another to build it. Yet no one ever thinks that the former\r\n     lives in vain.\"\r\n\r\nThe college pursued its work in the year 1896-7 without a president,\r\nand it is a happiness to note the fact that owing to the harmonious\r\ncooperation of a devoted faculty and a sympathetic body of students,\r\nthe year passed with much smoothness and prosperity.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of August, 1897, the Rev. Samuel B. McCormick, D. D., was\r\ncalled to the presidency of the college from the pastoral charge of the\r\nPresbyterian church of Omaha, Neb. He entered upon the duties of his\r\noffice with the opening of the college year 1897. He soon made it\r\nmanifest that a man of great vigor was directing its affairs. He went\r\nat his work with a spirit almost fierce, and he kept at it with a\r\npersistency that compelled things to come his way. His energy was\r\ncontagious, and his colleagues in the faculty and on the board of\r\ntrustees felt it from the day he came among us until the day he left.\r\nThe pace he kept was not always pleasurable, but it was always\r\nfruitful. It was during the seven years of his administration that\r\ngreat growth of the college was experienced in the size of the faculty,\r\nthe number of the student body and increase of college buildings. The\r\nfinancial campaign that was undertaken to secure the $25,000 promised\r\nby Mr. Ralph Vorhees, of New Jersey, on condition of our raising\r\n$125,000 additional, was successfully conducted when Dr. McCormick was\r\npresident. It was he who brought to Coe College the Rev. H. H. Maynard\r\nas field secretary, and the two men worked together with congenial\r\nvehemence and brought things to pass. Among the things which were\r\nbrought to pass was the present college gymnasium a very useful and\r\nattractive asset.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1904 Doctor McCormick was invited back to his old home\r\nin western Pennsylvania to become the chancellor of the Western\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, located at Pittsburg, and which is now\r\ncalled the University of Pittsburg. This invitation was attractive to\r\nhim chiefly because it seemed evidently to offer him unusual\r\nopportunity of enlarged usefulness in the educational field to which he\r\nhad devoted his life. Yet it plainly caused him a struggle to sever his\r\nconnection with Coe College, and with Cedar Rapids as a city. For in\r\nthe seven years of his life here, he had become strongly attached to\r\nhis friends and to the community which were strongly attached to him.\r\nHe also left this portion of our country, the Mississippi Valley which\r\nwas to his mind so full of hope and promise, with great reluctance. Yet\r\nit was clear to him that he ought to go, and we parted from him with\r\nmuch regret September 15, 1904.\r\n\r\nMarshall Hall and the Athletic Field House were erected in the summer\r\nof 1900, the latter the gift of Mr. C. B. Soutter. The College\r\nGymnasium was completed in 1904.\r\n\r\nDuring the year following the departure of Doctor McCormick the duties\r\nof the presidency were discharged by Dr. Stephen W. Stookey. Dr.\r\nStookey was an alumnus of Coe of the class of 1884, the first class to\r\nbe graduated after Coe became a college. He was always from the\r\nbeginning greatly attached to the college, and after teaching a while\r\nin the schools of Manchester, Iowa, he returned to his alma mater in\r\n1892 to become professor of the natural sciences. From that time onward\r\nhe filled a place of very distinguished usefulness in the institution,\r\ncommanding the high respect of his fellow workers in the faculty, the\r\nstudent body, and the board of trustees, until 1908 when he left Coe to\r\nassume the office of the presidency of Bellevue College, Nebraska, a\r\nposition which he still occupies very much to the benefit of that\r\nschool of learning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAPTIST CHURCH, CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD BARN BUILT IN THE '50s AT CENTRAL CITY Now Used as a\r\nStore and Post Office]\r\n\r\nAt this point of our story we note the fact that at the October meeting\r\nof the board of trustees in 1899, Mr. C. B. Soutter was made the\r\npresident of the board. Mr. Soutter had been a resident of Cedar Rapids\r\nsince 1881 when he came from New York city to fill the very responsible\r\nplace in the business house of T. M. Sinclair & Company made vacant\r\nby the death of Mr. Sinclair. The duties of the management of the large\r\npacking house were very onerous and responsible, yet Mr. Soutter was\r\nable, besides fulfilling them, to give much of his valuable time to his\r\nduties as a trustee of the college, to which he was called in 1883. He\r\nhad already, therefore, for many years, shown marked interest in\r\ncollege work and adaptation for it by taste and culture when in 1899 he\r\nwas felt to be the logical successor to Dr. Avery in the presidency. He\r\nentered at once with zeal and intelligence upon his new and enlarged\r\nduties. He was unintermitting in his attention to them until he\r\nresigned his office in October, 1907, and, greatly to the regret of his\r\nbrethren, withdrew from the board of trustees.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of December, 1904, Dr. William Wilberforce Smith was chosen\r\npresident of the college to succeed Doctor McCormick. Doctor Smith was\r\nnot a clergyman as his predecessors had been and as hitherto has been\r\nusual with American colleges in their selection of a president. He had\r\nstudied at Princeton Theological Seminary, and had been graduated\r\ntherefrom, but he had never been ordained to the ministry. He had\r\nfollowed the vocation of a teacher, and was called to the presidency of\r\nCoe from the Berkely School in New York city, a school of high grade\r\nfor boys. He entered upon his duties as president of Coe College at the\r\nopening of the college year 1905, and remained with the college for\r\nthree years. He is now occupying the very honorable position of head of\r\nthe School of Commerce and Finance in the James Millikin University,\r\nDecatur, Illinois.\r\n\r\nHis administration was marked by three notable events, all of which\r\nindicate stages of great progress in the history of the college: First,\r\nthe successful launching of the plans to put the college on the list of\r\nthe accepted colleges of the Carnegie foundation for the advancement of\r\nteaching. This took place near the close of the year 1908. Second, the\r\nattainment of the Science Hall, given by Mr. Carnegie at the cost to\r\nhim of $63,500 upon the condition that the college raise $45,000 for\r\nits maintenance. Third, the successful completion of a financial\r\ncampaign whereby a conditional grant of $50,000 was obtained from the\r\nGeneral Board of Education [John D. Rockefeller Foundation] on the\r\ncondition that the college pay all its debts and raise in various funds\r\nthe sum of $200,000 additional for endowment and buildings. This\r\ncampaign increased the assets of the college by $293,000.\r\n\r\nIt was during this campaign that the services of the Rev. Dr. H. H.\r\nMaynard, field secretary of the college, were so peculiarly strenuous\r\nand so uniquely valuable. Dr. Maynard merits most honorable mention for\r\nhis bold conceptions and his heroic execution of them, wherein the word\r\n\"fail\" was expunged from his dictionary. Dr. Maynard left Coe College\r\nin the summer of 1908 and has become the vice president and field\r\nsecretary of the University of Omaha, Nebraska.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1908-9 which followed the resignation of Dr. Smith, the\r\ncollege was governed by a commission of four members of the faculty,\r\nwho distributed among themselves the duties of administration. The\r\nresult was a smooth and prosperous year, although at the end of it all\r\nparties concerned were looking very wishfully towards a filling of the\r\nvacant office of the presidency. At length, on the 7th of September,\r\n1909, Rev. Dr. John Abner Marquis, pastor of the Presbyterian church at\r\nBeaver, Pa., was chosen to be the head of the college. After due\r\ndeliberation he decided to accept the call, and on the 12th of October,\r\n1909, he was presented to the students and friends of the college as\r\nthe president-elect. He returned to Beaver to sever his relations with\r\nthe church there, with the Presbytery and synod, and he came in\r\nDecember and entered upon his duties. On the 13th of June, 1910, in\r\nconnection with the exercises of commencement week, Doctor Marquis was\r\nformally inaugurated president of Coe College. This was the first time\r\nin which formal exercises of this character were observed in connection\r\nwith setting a president over the institution, and the occasion was\r\ngreeted accordingly with peculiar pleasure, and large use was made of\r\nit to perfect a relationship which it is believed augurs great things\r\nto the advantage of the college. Doctor Marquis has been so short a\r\ntime in his office that it would be too soon to speak of what he has\r\ndone, but it is not too soon to say that in the brief period in which\r\nhe has been president of the college, he has already awakened the\r\nfondest hopes and most steadfast convictions that under his\r\nadministration the institution over which he presides is destined to\r\nmove forward to a future which will far surpass any measure of size and\r\nvalue that it ever attained in the past.\r\n\r\nOn the same week in last June in the midst of the commencement season\r\nwhich witnessed the inauguration of Doctor Marquis, ground was broken\r\non the college campus by Mr. Robert S. Sinclair for a chapel in memory\r\nof his father, Mr. Thomas M. Sinclair. This memorial chapel was\r\nprepared for almost thirty years ago very soon after Mr. Sinclair's\r\ndeath, but the execution of the purpose has been long delayed. But now\r\nat last we see our thoughts and wishes about to be realized in the\r\nerection of a building which shall from its beauty and the purposes\r\nwhich it is destined to fulfill be a worthy monument to keep in\r\nperpetual remembrance a man, who, in his life-time, did so much to make\r\nit possible for us to have a college at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now accomplished the purpose for which we set out. We have, to\r\nthe best of our ability, traced the history of Coe College from its\r\nbeginnings to the present time. We have followed the Institution from\r\nits fountain head in the heart and home of the Rev. Williston Jones,\r\nwhen a handful of young men gathered in his parlor for such elementary\r\ninstruction as could be given by the zealous pastor and his wife, down\r\nto the present day, when more than three-hundred students, young men\r\nand maidens, gather in the halls of buildings erected and equipped for\r\ncollege purposes, and one of these buildings at least prepared and\r\nprovided along the most progressive modern lines, the equal of any in\r\nthe land. Today the faculty of thirty-two persons conducts the teaching\r\nof a curriculum which embraces every department of learning that is\r\nrecognized as belonging to a liberal education. And these teachers have\r\nbeen prepared for their work by special training and selection.\r\n\r\nThe endowment also has grown from the paltry sum of $1,500, furnished\r\nin 1853 by Daniel Coe, to the sum of $450,000, and the total amount of\r\nmoney invested in the plant known as Coe College must exceed $750,000,\r\nwhich is surely no mean aggregate.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our history, we have seen a feeble rivulet sink at\r\nleast twice in the sands only to reappear with new volume and freshness\r\nfurther down the bed of the stream. And we see it now a river of such\r\ndimension that it cannot disappear again. We have seen the work of the\r\nheroic men who have nobly spent upon the college in the days when it\r\nsorely needed their help. Such men were not wanting in the days of\r\nemergency but were sent from God. They could not have known as we now\r\ncan plainly see what they were doing. They wrought in faith what it is\r\nnow given us to possess in sight. They sowed in weakness what we now\r\nreap in power. Surely the lesson is plain and impressive; surely the\r\nteaching of this historical sketch is to the purport that we with our\r\nlarger resources should enrich the institution which they sustained and\r\npromoted in their poverty.\r\n\r\nThey could not see how much worth their while it was to give and labor\r\nfor Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute, for Parsons Seminary, for Coe\r\nCollegiate Institute, for the institution was then but a tender, feeble\r\nshoot, whose future development was an uncertainty. We now can plainly\r\nsee that it is well worth our while to give and labor for Coe College,\r\nfor it is now one of the most potent and promising of all the colleges\r\nin this Mississippi valley. And every intelligent mind who has any\r\npowers of observation and has any experience of college work, knows\r\nfull well that as colleges grow and prosper they need more financial\r\nhelp. It would be the extreme of selfishness and folly to take the\r\nview that Coe College is now strong enough and rich enough to advance\r\non its present assets to meet its future.\r\n\r\nIts needs are greater than ever. But it presents itself not as a beggar\r\nor a suppliant, but as a splendid opportunity for investment. It\r\npresents itself as the finest possible place to locate something to be\r\nspent in buildings, equipment, and endowment whereby in the course of\r\nthe years, and we may even say the centuries to come, this money can go\r\non yielding the richest conceivable dividends in the preparation for\r\nlife and leadership of those of our choicest young men and women who\r\nshall come hither from near and far to enjoy the privileges of a\r\ncollege education. And thus as we close, our history becomes really an\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n_The Old Blair Building_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kimball building in Cedar Rapids stands on the site of an old\r\nlandmark--the Blair building. This building, with the land and railroad\r\ncompanies it housed from time to time, was the center of much history\r\nin the development of Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. It is difficult\r\nfor us to realize now what an immense influence these companies in the\r\nearly days had in the settling up of the central west. A debt of\r\ngratitude is due the men who risked their fortunes in this developing\r\nwork that many of us now are too apt to forget. Had it not been for the\r\nrailroads these early patriots projected into the unsettled portions of\r\nthese states the development of the west would have been greatly\r\nretarded. Immigration would have been slow, for people are never eager\r\nto settle in farming communities where there is lack of transportation\r\nfacilities to get the produce of the farms to market.\r\n\r\nIt is felt that a brief account of the influences that went out from\r\nthis center is entirely appropriate here. In fact it is needed as a\r\npart of this history of Linn county. Greatly to our regret the\r\ngentleman responsible for the historical data given below wishes his\r\nname withheld, but through modesty only. What is here printed was\r\nfurnished by one who knows whereof he speaks, for as Virgil once wrote,\r\n\"of it he was a great part.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLAIR BUILDING\r\n\r\nJohn I. Blair, of Blairstown, New Jersey, being then the president of\r\nseveral railroad companies having their general offices and official\r\nheadquarters at Cedar Rapids, erected a building to furnish adequate\r\nroom for the business of these companies and for the First National\r\nBank of Cedar Rapids, in which he was heavily interested. This building\r\nwas known as the \"Blair Building.\" In its time it was much the most\r\npretentious structure in the city. It was located at the corner of\r\nEagle and Adams streets--now Third street and Second avenue--was two\r\nstories in heighth with a high mansard roof, and set above and back\r\nfrom the street. The plans for this building were made by W. W.\r\nBoyington, then the most prominent architect in Chicago. It was what\r\nmight be termed of the \"court house\" style, having more the appearance\r\nof a public building than one erected for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nOn May 23, 1868, Mrs. Mary A. Ely purchased of A. C. Churchill, for Mr.\r\nBlair, lots 6, 7, and 8 in block 15, including the brick dwelling house\r\nthereon, for the sum of $10,000. Mrs. Ely afterwards conveyed this land\r\nto Mr. Blair, who deeded it to himself and Oakes Ames as trustees for\r\nthe several companies who contributed to the cost of the land and the\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThe work of construction began in the autumn of 1868. The building was\r\ncompleted and occupied in the spring or early summer of 1869. The total\r\ncost of the land, the new building, and the overhauling of the dwelling\r\nhouse was $54,418, which was paid by the Cedar Rapids and Missouri\r\nRiver Railroad Company, The Iowa Rail Road Land Company, the Iowa Falls\r\nand Sioux City Railroad Company, the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany, and the First National Bank of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES E. HARLAN, LL. D. President Cornell College]\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the dwelling house and the land lying southwesterly of the wall\r\nof the Blair building was sold to John F. Ely for $11,000. In 1884 the\r\nFirst National Bank conveyed its interest to the Iowa Falls and Sioux\r\nCity Railroad Company, and thereafter, until the liquidation of the\r\nbank in 1886, occupied the banking room as a tenant. When the bank had\r\ngone out of business, the railroads had been sold and the offices moved\r\naway, and the real estate holdings of the companies very largely\r\nreduced, the owners having no use for the space for their own purposes,\r\nand the building being so constructed as not to be useful for\r\ncommercial purposes, it was decided to sell the property. It was\r\nadvertised for sale. A customer not being found at private sale, it was\r\nsold at public auction on May 2, 1888, to David P. Kimball, of Boston,\r\nMassachusetts, for $25,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Kimball, together with his brother L. C. Kimball, of Boston, J. Van\r\nDeventer, then of Clinton but later of Knoxville, Tennessee, J. E.\r\nAinsworth, then of Council Bluffs but later of Williamstown, Vermont,\r\nand P. E. Hall and Henry V. Ferguson of Cedar Rapids, organized the\r\nKimball Building Company, to whom the property was conveyed.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1888 the Kimball Building Company rebuilt the Blair\r\nBuilding, extending its exterior walls out to the street line and added\r\na new portion so as to cover the entire lot, making the building when\r\nso completed 76 feet on Second avenue and 140 feet on Third street,\r\nfour stories high, and thereafter known as the \"Kimball Building.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to being the president of all of these railroad companies,\r\nMr. Blair after 1862 gave personal attention to their construction and\r\nwas in absolute control of their affairs in the west. These railroads\r\ncame to be called the \"Blair Roads,\" and were so generally spoken of in\r\nthe public prints. From this people generally came to think that he was\r\nnearly the sole owner of all, or at least personally owned a\r\ncontrolling interest in the whole group. This, however, was not the\r\nfact. Mr. Blair's individual ownership averaged about one-sixth, about\r\nanother sixth being owned by his associates in the Lackawana Iron &\r\nCoal Company of Pennsylvania, among which were Joseph H. Scranton, of\r\nScranton, Pa.; Moses Taylor, of New York, and William E. Dodge, D.\r\nWillis James, and James Stokes, who then comprised the firm of Phelps,\r\nDodge & Company.\r\n\r\nThe controlling interest was always owned by a group of New England\r\ncapitalists and their associates, who were at the same time the\r\ncontrolling stockholders in the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railroad\r\nCompany--the line already constructed from Clinton to Cedar Rapids.\r\nAmong these latter were Oakes and Oliver Ames, of North Easton, Mass.;\r\nJohn Bertram, of Salem, Mass.; Charles A. Lambard, of Maine and later\r\nof New York; William T. Glidden, David P. Kimball, Joseph and Frederic\r\nNickerson, of Boston, and Horace Williams, of Clinton, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEDAR RAPIDS AND MISSOURI RIVER RAILROAD\r\n\r\nIn May, 1856, congress passed what was then called \"The Iowa Land\r\nBill,\" making grants of land to the state of Iowa to aid in the\r\nconstruction of four lines of railway across the state, one of which\r\nwas to be from Lyons City, thence \"northwesterly to a point of\r\nintersection with the main line of the Iowa Central Railroad near\r\nMaquoketa, thence on said main line running as near as practicable to\r\nthe 42nd parallel across the state of Iowa to the Missouri River.\" The\r\ngeneral assembly of the state by an act approved July 14, 1856, granted\r\nthe land inuring to the state for the construction of this line to the\r\nIowa Central Air Line Railroad Company upon certain conditions\r\ncontained in said act. That company began the construction of the road\r\nin the year 1856, considerable grading was done at different points\r\nalong the line as far west us Anamosa, but the panic of 1857 coming on\r\nthe work was stopped and never again resumed by the Iowa Central Air\r\nLine Company.\r\n\r\nIt being quite probable that at the next legislative session the state\r\nwould resume this land grant and forfeit the rights of the Iowa Central\r\nCompany, and pass the grant over to some other company who would\r\nundertake the construction of the road; for the purpose of obtaining\r\nthis grant, the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad Company was\r\norganized on June 14, 1859, by the prominent eastern stockholders in\r\nthe Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad, together with John Weare and\r\nJohn P. Ely, of Cedar Rapids, and G. M. Woodbury, of Marshalltown,\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1860, the state resumed the land grant from the Iowa Central\r\nCompany and made it over to the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River\r\nRailroad. Work was begun on the line west from Cedar Rapids in 1860.\r\nThe bridge over the Cedar river was built in the winter of 1860-61, and\r\nforty miles of track completed to Otter Creek Station (now Chelsea)\r\nduring the year 1861, and to Marshalltown in December, 1862. Milo\r\nSmith, of Clinton, Iowa, was the chief engineer and had charge of the\r\nconstruction of the road until it reached Marshalltown.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 John I. Blair became largely interested in this enterprise, and\r\nthereafter took control of the construction beyond Marshalltown. After\r\n1862 W. W. Walker was chief engineer until the road was finished. Track\r\nwas laid to State Center in 1863, and on July 4, 1864, to Nevada, and\r\nto Boone in December, 1864, but the road was not surfaced up, finished\r\nand put in operation from Nevada to Boone until the succeeding year.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1864, congress made an additional grant of land to the Cedar\r\nRapids and Missouri River Railroad, and authorized it to change its\r\nline of road so as to connect with the Union Pacific Railroad at\r\nCouncil Bluffs. Work beyond Boone began in December, 1865, the track\r\nwas laid into Council Bluffs in January, 1867, but regular service\r\nbetween Woodbine and Council Bluffs was not instituted until April of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1862, the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was leased\r\nin perpetuity to the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad Company, which\r\ncompany then owned the line from Chicago west to the Mississippi River\r\nopposite Clinton, Iowa, and operated the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska\r\nRailroad under lease. The lease covered not only the portion of the\r\nCedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad then built, but the entire\r\nline to the Missouri river when the same should be completed.\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 1864, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad Company was\r\nconsolidated with the Chicago and North-Western Railway, and from that\r\ntime the operation of the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad\r\nunder the lease was by the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company.\r\n\r\nL. B. Crocker, of Oswego, N. Y., was the first president of the Cedar\r\nRapids and Missouri River Railroad, and until 1866. Mr. Crocker during\r\nthis period was active in the financial affairs of the company, and\r\nespecially in obtaining the land grant from the state and the\r\nsupplemental grant direct from the United States. While not a man of\r\nlarge means, he was possessed of great energy and foresight.\r\n\r\nJohn I. Blair was president from 1866 to 1871, when he was succeeded by\r\nHorace Williams, who remained the president until the company went out\r\nof existence in 1884.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was sold to the\r\nChicago and North-Western Railway. It was in fact a consolidation, but\r\nfor convenience in handling the transaction it was made a sale, the\r\nCedar Rapids Company deeding its railroad and all rights and franchises\r\npertaining thereto to the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company,\r\nreceiving its pay in the stock of the latter company, which stock was\r\ndistributed pro rata to the stockholders of the Cedar Rapids and\r\nMissouri River Company, after which the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River\r\nRailroad Company closed up its affairs and went out of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIOUX CITY AND PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY\r\n\r\nAn act of congress passed in 1862 authorized and required the Union\r\nPacific Railroad Company to construct a railroad and telegraph line\r\nfrom Sioux City to a connection with the Iowa branch of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad, whenever there should be a line of railroad completed\r\nthrough Minnesota or Iowa to Sioux City, Iowa. On July 2, 1864, the\r\noriginal Union Pacific act was amended, and among other things it was\r\nprovided that the Union Pacific Railroad was released from the\r\nconstruction of said branch, and such company as should be organized\r\nunder the laws of Iowa, Minnesota, Dakota or Nebraska, and be by the\r\npresident of the United States designated and approved for that\r\npurpose, was authorized to construct said branch and receive therefor\r\nlands and subsidy bonds to the same extent that the Union Pacific\r\nRailroad would have done under the act of 1862. It was further provided\r\nthat if a railroad should not be completed to Sioux City across Iowa or\r\nMinnesota within eighteen months after the passage of said act, then\r\nthe company which should have been so designated might commence,\r\ncontinue and complete the construction of said Sioux City branch.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux City and Pacific Railroad Company was organized in August,\r\n1864, to construct this branch line and was by the president of the\r\nUnited States designated and approved for that purpose. The corporators\r\nand first board of directors were Platt Smith, L. B. Crocker, M. K.\r\nJesup, James F. Wilson, A. W. Hubbard, Charles A. Lambard, Frederick\r\nSchuchardt, William B. Allison, and John I. Blair. Soon afterwards the\r\nSioux City and Pacific Company passed under the control of Mr. Blair\r\nand his associates in the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad. The\r\nnecessary money to build and equip the Sioux City and Pacific was\r\nprincipally furnished by them. The general offices of the company were\r\nfirst at Dubuque, but on the passing of the control to the Cedar Rapids\r\npeople headquarters were moved to Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nConstruction was begun in the spring of 1867. The Cedar Rapids and\r\nMissouri River Company built six and a half miles of railroad from\r\nMissouri Valley Junction to California Junction, where it connected\r\nwith the line of the Sioux City and Pacific. These six and a half miles\r\nwere turned over to the latter company. Track laying began at\r\nCalifornia Junction in September, 1867. Thirty-six miles were completed\r\nby the first day of December, 1867, and the line to Sioux City in\r\nFebruary, 1868. Early in 1869 the entire line was completed and in\r\noperation between Missouri Valley Junction and Sioux City and to\r\nFremont, Nebraska, where connection was made with the Union Pacific\r\nRailroad. The cars were ferried across the Missouri river during the\r\nsummer months, and crossed on a temporary bridge during the winter\r\nmonths up to the fall of 1883, when the bridge across the river was\r\ncompleted and opened up for business. L. Burnett was the engineer in\r\ncharge of construction of this railroad and superintendent in its\r\noperation until January 1, 1878.\r\n\r\nThis company received from the United States a grant of land comprising\r\nthe alternate sections within twenty miles on either side of the line\r\nof the railroad. But as nearly all of the government land within these\r\nlimits had already been disposed of, and where the grant of this\r\ncompany lapped over the grant to the Union Pacific Railroad, each\r\ncompany received half, so this congressional grant only amounted to\r\nabout 42,500 acres. There was acquired through a consolidation with the\r\nNebraska Air Line Railroad a state land grant of 46,000 acres. The\r\ncompany received from the United States a loan of six per cent bonds to\r\nthe extent of $16,000 per mile of road constructed between Sioux City\r\nand Fremont, and issued its own first mortgage bonds to an equal\r\namount.\r\n\r\nThis company up to August, 1884, operated its own road and also leased\r\nand operated the Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley road, as the same\r\nwas from time to time extended. The earnings of the railroad were never\r\nsufficient to pay the interest on the first mortgage bonds. The avails\r\nof the two land grants and the proceeds of the sales of the town lots\r\nalong the line up to 1875 (when the remaining land assets were sold to\r\nthe Missouri Valley Land Company) were used to make up the deficiency.\r\nAfter these assets were exhausted the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River,\r\nand Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad companies, through loans and\r\nother methods of assistance, made up the deficit until the sale of all\r\nof these roads in 1884.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska, and the Cedar Rapids and\r\nMissouri River companies by purchase from the individual stockholders\r\nacquired over ninety per cent of the capital stock of the Sioux City\r\nCompany. This stock was in the treasury of these railroads at the time\r\nof their purchase by the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company in\r\n1884. Through and under that purchase the Chicago and North-Western\r\nRailway Company became the controlling owner of the Sioux City and\r\nPacific and moved its general and operating offices away from Cedar\r\nRapids.\r\n\r\nJohn I. Blair was the first president of the Sioux City and Pacific\r\nRailroad Company and was succeeded by Horace Williams in 1871. Mr.\r\nWilliams was president until the fall of 1877, when he resigned and was\r\nsucceeded by Oliver Ames. Mr. Ames remained president until the control\r\nof the railroad passed into the Chicago and North-Western Railway\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IOWA FALLS AND SIOUX CITY RAILROAD COMPANY\r\n\r\nIn the Iowa Land Bill of 1856 a grant was made to aid the construction\r\nof a line of railroad from Dubuque to Sioux City on the same terms as\r\nfixed for the other three trunk lines across the state, viz: a grant of\r\nevery odd numbered section within six miles on either side of the\r\nrailroad, and where such odd numbered sections had already been\r\ndisposed of by the United States, the railroads were authorized to\r\nselect an equal number of acres from the odd numbered sections within\r\nfifteen miles of the line of the railroad. This grant was given over by\r\nthe state of Iowa to the Dubuque and Pacific Railroad Company, which\r\ncompany began the work of construction but afterwards failed and was\r\nreorganized as the Dubuque and Sioux City Railroad Company. This last\r\nnamed company continued from time to time to extend the line\r\nwestwardly, so that in 1867 it was completed and in operation to Iowa\r\nFalls.\r\n\r\nConsiderable right-of-way had been acquired between Iowa Falls and Fort\r\nDodge and the grading already commenced when a sale and transfer of the\r\nright-of-way, the uncompleted work and the portion of the land grant\r\nbelonging to the line west of Iowa Falls, was made to John I. Blair and\r\nhis associates. The Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Company was\r\norganized on October 1, 1867, and on January 7, 1868, by a contract of\r\nthat date, took over from the Dubuque and Sioux City Company all the\r\nright-of-way west of Iowa Falls and the work already done, also the\r\nproportion of the land grant inuring to the line west of Iowa Falls and\r\nall of the rights and franchises of the Dubuque & Sioux City Company\r\npertaining to that portion of the line.\r\n\r\nPrior to this date, viz: on September 13, 1867, the Dubuque and Sioux\r\nCity Railroad Company leased to the Illinois Central Railroad Company\r\nthe portion of its road already constructed to Iowa Falls and also the\r\nline to be thereafter built from Iowa Falls to Sioux City. This lease\r\nwas for twenty years or in perpetuity at the option of the Illinois\r\nCentral Railroad Company. The legislature of the state of Iowa on April\r\n7, 1868, passed an act ratifying the said sale by the Dubuque and Sioux\r\nCity Company and vesting the land grant in the Iowa Falls Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTIAN CHURCH, CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\nThe work begun by the Dubuque and Sioux City Company was vigorously\r\nprosecuted so that the road was completed and in operation to Fort\r\nDodge early in 1869. In the fall of 1870 it was finished through to\r\nSioux City and the entire line turned over to the Illinois Central\r\nRailroad Company for operation under the lease. J. E. Ainsworth was\r\nsuperintendent of construction. In the original articles of\r\nincorporation the principal place of business of this company was fixed\r\nat Dubuque, Iowa, but in October, 1869, the articles were amended and\r\nthe main office of the company moved to Cedar Rapids. John I. Blair was\r\nthe first president. He was succeeded in 1871 by Horace Williams, who\r\nremained at the head of the affairs of the company until the control of\r\nthe same passed into the hands of the Illinois Central Railroad.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1887, the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Company sold to\r\nthe Iowa Rail Road Land Company the remaining acres of its land grant\r\nand all assets accruing from land transactions. At that time all of the\r\nindividual stockholders of the railroad company sold their shares to\r\nthe Illinois Central Railroad Company, who moved the offices of the\r\ncorporation from Cedar Rapids to Dubuque, and afterwards consolidated\r\nthe company with the Dubuque and Sioux City Railroad Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREMONT, ELKHORN AND MISSOURI VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY\r\n\r\nThis company, while a Nebraska corporation, soon after its organization\r\nand up to 1884 kept its general offices and accounting department in\r\nthe Blair building in Cedar Rapids. It was organized at Fremont,\r\nNebraska, in January, 1869, to construct a line of railroad up the\r\nElkhorn Valley, in Nebraska, and obtained a land grant from the state\r\nof Nebraska amounting to about 100,000 acres, also some county bonds\r\nfrom Dodge and Cuming counties, Nebraska. In 1869 John I. Blair and his\r\nassociates in the Sioux City and Pacific, and the Cedar Rapids and\r\nMissouri River enterprises obtained control of the company, and\r\nundertook the construction of the railroad. Ten miles of track north\r\nfrom Fremont were laid late in the season of 1869. In 1870 the road was\r\nfinished to West Point, and leased to the Sioux City and Pacific\r\nCompany, which company from that time on continued to operate (under\r\nsaid lease) the several extensions of the Elkhorn road up to August,\r\n1884. In 1871 the road was extended to Wisner, a distance of fifty-one\r\nmiles from Fremont, where the terminus remained until 1879, in which\r\nyear the main line was built to Oakdale, and six miles of track laid on\r\nthe Creighton branch north from Norfolk. In 1880 the main line was\r\nextended from Oakdale to Neligh, and the Creighton branch finished to\r\nPlainview. In 1881 the main line was extended to Long Pine, and the\r\nCreighton branch finished to Creighton. In 1882 the main line was\r\nextended to Thatcher, and in 1883 to Valentine. In August, 1884--at the\r\ntime of the purchase of the Iowa roads by the Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern--this last named company acquired all the stock in the\r\nFremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley Railroad, and thereafter the work of\r\nextension was pushed vigorously.\r\n\r\nIn the two succeeding years a line was built into the Black Hills\r\ncountry and the main line of the road extended to the eastern boundary\r\nof the state of Wyoming. Between 1884 and 1888 several lines of\r\nrailroad in the south Platte country of Nebraska were constructed by\r\nthe Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley Company. L. Burnett, was\r\nengineer in charge of location and construction until the road was\r\ncompleted to Wisner. From 1879 to 1889--during which period the main\r\nline from Wisner to the west line of the state, the Black Hills branch\r\nas far as Whitewood, and the South Platte lines were built--P. E. Hall\r\nwas superintendent of construction and J. E. Ainsworth chief engineer.\r\nJohn I. Blair was the president from 1869 to 1872, Prince S. Crowell,\r\nof East Dennis, Massachusetts, from 1872 to 1876, and James Blair, of\r\nScranton, Pennsylvania, from 1876 to 1883, when he was succeeded by\r\nHorace Williams, who remained the president of the company until the\r\ncontrol was taken by the Chicago & North-Western Railway Company in\r\n1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAPLE RIVER RAILROAD\r\n\r\nThe major portion of the land grant to the Cedar Rapids and Missouri\r\nRiver Railroad--transferred to The Iowa Rail Road Land Company--was\r\nsituated north of the main line of the Cedar Rapids & Missouri River\r\nRailroad. In 1876 a large portion of several counties was vacant and\r\nstill the property of the land company, so the stockholders interested\r\nin the Cedar Rapids & Missouri River Railroad and The Iowa Rail Road\r\nLand Company decided to build branch lines north from the main line to\r\nthe end that purchasers might be found for the land and thus settle up\r\nthe country, and furnish business for the main line. The Maple River\r\nRailroad Company was organized in that year to build these lines. The\r\nmoney for the building of the same was furnished by the stockholders in\r\nthe Cedar Rapids and Missouri River, and Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska\r\ncompanies, they taking the stock and bonds of the Maple River Railroad\r\nCompany issued for construction. The road was leased to the Chicago &\r\nNorth-Western Railway Company in advance of construction. Work was\r\nbegun in the fall of 1876, and in 1877 the line was completed from\r\nMaple River Junction to Mapleton, a distance of about sixty miles.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 a branch was built from Wall Lake Junction to Sac City. This\r\nSac City branch was extended to Holstein in 1882, and in 1883 to\r\nKingsley. The building of the above lines was under control of P. E.\r\nHall, vice president. J. E. Ainsworth was the chief engineer. In 1884\r\nwhen the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River, Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska,\r\nand Sioux City and Pacific roads were purchased by the Chicago &\r\nNorth-Western, the Maple River Railroad was included in the sale, and\r\nfrom that time on became a part of the Chicago & North-Western Railway,\r\nwhich company has since extended the branch line from Kingsley to\r\nSargeants Bluffs, thus making another through line from the east into\r\nSioux City, and also extended the main line from Mapleton to Onawa.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSOURI VALLEY AND BLAIR RAILWAY & BRIDGE COMPANY\r\n\r\nIn 1882 congress granted to the Sioux City & Pacific Railroad Company\r\nthe right to build a bridge across the Missouri river to connect the\r\nIowa and Nebraska portions of its railway at the point where the line\r\ncrosses the river between Missouri Valley, Iowa, and Blair, Nebraska.\r\nThe Sioux City & Pacific Company not being financially able to\r\nundertake the work, assigned its rights under said act to the Missouri\r\nValley and Blair Railway & Bridge Company, which company was organized\r\nin 1882 for the purpose of building the bridge and its approaches. The\r\ncapital stock of the bridge company was subscribed for by the several\r\nrailroad companies whose roads made up the through line from Fremont to\r\nChicago, viz: the Sioux City and Pacific, Cedar Rapids and Missouri\r\nRiver, Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska, and the Chicago & North-Western\r\ncompanies, each taking stock in proportion to its mileage in the\r\nthrough line between Fremont and Chicago. The money for the\r\nconstruction of the bridge was raised principally by the sale of bonds,\r\nwhich bonds were guaranteed--both principal and interest--by the\r\nseveral railroad companies who were stockholders in the bridge company.\r\nWork was begun early in the summer of 1882 and the bridge completed and\r\nopened for traffic in November, 1883.\r\n\r\nWhen the bridge was opened for business it had cost about $1,300,000,\r\nof which $400,000 was for the bridge proper across the channel of the\r\nriver and the other $900,000 for the approaches and protection work.\r\nSeveral hundred thousand dollars have since been expended in protecting\r\nthe river banks so as to hold the channel of the river under the\r\nbridge. After its completion the bridge was operated by the Sioux City\r\nand Pacific Railroad Company under a contract.\r\n\r\nHorace Williams was the president of the bridge company from the date\r\nof organization to the time when the control passed to the Chicago &\r\nNorth-Western Railway. P. E. Hall was vice president and in general\r\ncharge of construction. George S. Morrison was the engineer who made\r\nthe plans and directed the building of the bridge. When the Chicago &\r\nNorth-Western Railway Company took over the Cedar Rapids and Missouri\r\nRiver and the other roads in 1884, it became the owner of the entire\r\ncapital stock of the bridge company and moved the accounting offices\r\naway from Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe total grants of lands to these companies by the United States, the\r\nstate of Nebraska, and several counties in Iowa, amounted in the\r\naggregate to about one million, nine hundred and ninety thousand acres.\r\nAs the several railroads were projected it was the policy of the\r\ncompanies to acquire land around the stations and plat and sell town\r\nlots. For convenience in distribution of the proceeds to the\r\nstockholders, and in handling the real estate, land and town lot\r\ncompanies were organized from time to time to take over and dispose of\r\nnot only the land grant lands but of the purchased lands and town lots.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IOWA RAIL ROAD LAND COMPANY\r\n\r\nThis company was organized in 1869 and its capital stock distributed\r\npro rata among the stockholders of the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River\r\nRailroad. The land grant of that railroad company was conveyed to the\r\nland company on September 15, 1869. In 1887 the Iowa Rail Road Land\r\nCompany bought from the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Company for\r\ncash, all of its remaining unsold lands and the bills receivable, and\r\nother assets resulting from previous sales.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time thereafter, through consolidation and purchase, all\r\nof the remaining real estate and bills receivable of these several land\r\nand town lot companies and of the Moingona Coal Company, which were\r\nunder common control, passed to the ownership of The Iowa Rail Road\r\nLand Company.\r\n\r\nThe Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was finished in 1867, and\r\nthe land grant completely earned then. From that time on the officers\r\nof the railroad company and of its successor, the land company, for\r\nthirty-five years persistently and continuously worked to have this\r\nland grant finally adjusted so that the tracts actually granted might\r\nbe definitely known and the companies receive evidence of title\r\nthereto. Their efforts were finally successful in 1902.\r\n\r\nJohn I. Blair was the first president of this company. Horace Williams\r\nwas president from 1871 to 1872. In 1872 J. Van Deventer, then of\r\nClinton, Iowa, and later of Knoxville, Tennessee, was elected president\r\nand remained so until 1889, since which time P. E. Hall has been the\r\npresident of this company.\r\n\r\nHenry V. Ferguson, now vice president of this company, came into the\r\nemploy of these companies in 1868, and has been continuously in their\r\nservice since that time. P. E. Hall has been an officer of The Iowa\r\nRail Road Land Company since 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN LOT COMPANIES\r\n\r\nThe Blair Town Lot and Land Company was organized in June, 1871, and\r\ntook over the unsold town lots and purchased lands along the line of\r\nthe Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad, and also the avails from\r\nprevious sales. It was consolidated with The Iowa Rail Road Land\r\nCompany in 1888.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux City and Iowa Falls Town Lot and Land Company, organized in\r\n1871 to dispose of the town lots and purchased lands along the Iowa\r\nFalls and Sioux City railroad between Iowa Falls and Sioux City, was\r\nconsolidated with The Iowa Rail Road Land Company in 1888.\r\n\r\nThe Elkhorn Land and Town Lot Company was organized under the laws of\r\nthe state of Nebraska in February, 1871. There was conveyed to this\r\ncompany the land grant made to the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley\r\nroad, also the purchased lands and town lots at the several stations\r\nbetween Fremont and Wisner. This company was consolidated with The Iowa\r\nRail Road Land Company in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe capital stock of these three companies was issued pro rata to the\r\nstockholders of the respective railroad companies along the lines of\r\nwhich these town lot companies respectively operated.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Valley Land Company was organized in May, 1875, and\r\npurchased for cash the remaining unsold portion of the land grant of\r\nthe Sioux City and Pacific Railroad Company, as well as the unsold town\r\nlots and purchased lands belonging to that company. This company was\r\nconsolidated with The Iowa Rail Road Land Company on May 3, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOINGONA COAL COMPANY\r\n\r\nWhen the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was extended west\r\nfrom Boone there was purchased for account of the stockholders of that\r\ncompany certain timber and coal lands at and near Moingona--where the\r\nline of railroad crosses the Des Moines river. The Moingona Coal\r\nCompany was organized in June, 1866. These coal and timber lands were\r\nconveyed to that company, and its shares of capital stock ultimately\r\nallotted pro rata to those stockholders in the Cedar Rapids and\r\nMissouri River Railroad, who had furnished the money for the\r\nconstruction of the line west of Boone--known as the third division of\r\nthe Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad. The town of Moingona was\r\nplatted and put upon the market and coal mines opened at that point,\r\nwhich mines were operated continuously for about twenty years. In 1899\r\nmining operations had ceased and the personal property of the coal\r\ncompany having been closed out, the remaining real estate was turned\r\nover to The Iowa Rail Road Land Company.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate sales up to 1910 made by these railroads, land and town\r\nlot companies and this coal company, including land grant lands,\r\npurchased lands, and town lots, amount to sixteen million, six hundred\r\nand sixteen thousand dollars. The taxes paid by said companies on said\r\nreal estate while held by them amount to two million, seven hundred and\r\nforty-seven thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nFor many years it has been fashionable for magazine writers and a\r\ncertain class of politicians to severely criticise and condemn the\r\npublic men of that day for their action in making land grants to\r\nrailroad companies. The members of congress have been characterized as\r\nimbecile and corrupt, and the recipients of land grants denounced as\r\nthieves and robbers. While it is quite probable that in some cases\r\nsufficient care was not exercised, and that such grants sometimes have\r\nbeen a little too liberal, looking at the situation as it was in those\r\ndays and the subsequent results, there can be no doubt whatever that\r\nthe policy was a sound one and the action of congress in most of the\r\ncases exactly right.\r\n\r\nA large portion of what is now known as \"the middle west\" then\r\nconsisted of vast unbroken stretches of prairie land, impossible of\r\nsettlement because of the want of timber for fuel and building\r\npurposes. This territory could not support a population until\r\ntransportation facilities were provided for carrying in the necessary\r\nlumber, fuel, and supplies, and carrying away the agricultural products\r\nas the land should become cultivated. The price of the land at private\r\nentry was then $1.25 per acre. The government gave half of the lands\r\nwithin the land grant limits to the railroads and immediately advanced\r\nthe price on the even sections to $2.50 per acre, not only getting the\r\nsame amount of money for the same acreage, but making sales of the\r\ngovernment land much more rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE AT TROY MILLS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILL AND DAM, COGGON]\r\n\r\nSoon after the first of these grants was made it became the policy of\r\nthe government to give away its public lands to actual settlers. Until\r\nthe railroads were built through these vast bodies of vacant lands it\r\nhad not been possible for the United States to even give away its\r\nlands, but after the construction of such roads the whole of this vast\r\nterritory was in a few years occupied by actual settlers. This\r\nsettlement and the growth in population and wealth resulting therefrom\r\nhave more than any one thing contributed to the present greatness of\r\nthis United States.\r\n\r\nThe land grant railroads taken as a whole have not been a source of\r\nmuch profit to the original stock and bond holders. In many cases the\r\ncompanies have been forced into extensive and costly litigation to\r\nprotect their rights; taxing authorities--both county and state--have\r\nregarded these land grant companies as legitimate prey. The fact that\r\nthese several lines of road were built in advance of settlement and\r\ncivilization in almost every instance, made the first earnings of the\r\nroads insufficient to pay interest on bonds issued for construction,\r\nlet alone dividends to stockholders, so that quite often a large\r\nportion of the avails of the sales of these lands had to be used to pay\r\ninterest on the bonds.\r\n\r\nA majority of the land grant railroads have gone through reorganization\r\nand foreclosure, some of them several times. In the cases where there\r\nhas been a profit to the original investors, it has been no greater\r\nthan it ought to have been considering the risks run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n_Some of the Old Cemeteries_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father of Osgood Shepherd, who died in the summer of 1839, was\r\ninterred at the top of the hill above the tracks on A avenue in Cedar\r\nRapids where the Cedar Rapids Candy Company has erected a building.\r\nDuring the excavation several other graves were found, but it is not\r\nknown who were buried there.\r\n\r\nAnother cemetery where a number of old settlers were buried was on\r\nFifth avenue and Eighth street where W. W. Higley later settled; these\r\nbodies were removed when Oak Hill Cemetery was laid out. At Linwood\r\nburials were made at an early date. One of the first cemeteries was\r\nknown as Craig's cemetery on section 7 in Franklin township about three\r\nmiles west of Mt. Vernon. Elias Doty was buried here in 1841 and James\r\nDoty in 1847. Members of the Craig family and many others of the first\r\nsettlers were also buried here. This cemetery is not now kept up and it\r\nis not even surrounded by a fence.\r\n\r\nCampbell's cemetery was set off by Samuel Campbell, who donated an acre\r\nfor cemetery purposes. Here Samuel Craig was buried in 1840, members of\r\nthe Oxley family, the Hunter family, and of the John Paul family, also\r\nof the Smith, Berry, Snyder, Blaine, and Darr families, names familiar\r\nto all who have a knowledge of early Linn county history.\r\n\r\nThe Rogers cemetery, laid out by old Dan Rogers, is on the west side of\r\nthe river near Ivanhoe. Here, also, are buried many of the first\r\nsettlers who lived on the west side of the river.\r\n\r\nA little to the north of Cedar Rapids near the Illinois Central track\r\nthe relic hunter can find some ruins of what is known as \"McCloud's\r\nRun.\" Only a few crumbling ruins remain of what used to be an old mill\r\nknown to all the old settlers in the county. Through this picturesque\r\nvalley runs a winding brook known as \"Cold Stream,\" a beautiful rivulet\r\nwhose clear transparent water plays sonorous music as it runs swiftly\r\nover the pebbles as if hastening to join its forces with the Cedar. The\r\nsurrounding hills have in a good measure been shorn of their beauty by\r\ncutting down the timber, and now only the naked clay hills remain,\r\noffering a poor pasture for cattle. West of this stream on top of the\r\nhill overlooking the city can be found a few broken headstones and some\r\nmounds, but no flowers and no evergreens can be seen, not even a fence\r\nof any kind, for this little space, like all the surrounding hills, is\r\ngiven up to the pasturing of cattle. There in the vicinity of the city\r\nare more than ninety mounds showing that Linn county was from the\r\nearliest time a fit abode for man. Who these first settlers were we do\r\nnot know; they have left us no other relics but these mounds; their\r\nfuneral pyres and a few carvings indicate that they were Sun and Star\r\nworshippers, but whether they belonged to our Indian race has never\r\nbeen ascertained; however, the mound builder serves as a chain in man's\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOn the top of this hill is located the family cemetery of the McCloud\r\nfamily. John McCloud came here in 1838, and for a number of years was\r\none of the prominent men of this county. From an examination of the\r\nsmall marble slabs thrown about in confusion, scratched by the hand of\r\nvandals, are to be found the following inscriptions: \"Departed this\r\nlife June 6, 1846, Hester, consort of John Vardy, age 37 years; in life\r\nbeloved; in death lamented.\" \"Angelia, died August 30, 1852.\" \"Grant,\r\ndied March 29, 1852.\" \"Alpheus, died December 28, 1861.\" \"Eliza Jane,\r\ndied January 11, 1862.\" \"Ester Ann, died January 11, 1861, 15 years.\"\r\nAll were children of John G. and J. McCloud. \"John McCloud, died\r\nNovember 10, 1863, age 61 years 7 months and 29 days.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. John Vardy died in 1846 and was buried in this cemetery. Many of\r\nthese places are neglected, and weeds grow in profusion and the head\r\nstones are marred and weather beaten so that the names, dates and\r\ndeaths of many pioneer men and women have been effaced. This is the\r\nhistory of many neglected burial places in various parts of this\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nOwners of land on which these small places are located think more of\r\ntheir value for corn lands than they do as places for a cemetery, and\r\nin many localities these cemeteries have been changed into pastures and\r\ncorn fields and not even a headstone can be found to tell where some\r\ndear father or mother was buried in the long ago.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians, Jews, Greeks, and Romans all protected the burial places\r\nof their dead, and after a lapse of 2,000 years we can still go back\r\nand find something as to how the dead were cared for, and the very\r\nplace in which they were buried venerated by succeeding generations,\r\nwhile out here in Iowa after a lapse of only half a century many of\r\nthese places have been neglected and ignored and now some descendant\r\nreturning to the home of his fathers may be unable to find any trace of\r\nwhere they were buried. Certainly some protection should be offered by\r\nthe county or the state so that these sacred places may be preserved\r\nand the memory of the old settlers duly honored for what they\r\naccomplished during the pioneer days in Linn county.\r\n\r\nSpring Grove cemetery, near Palo, is one of the oldest cemeteries west\r\nof the river. Many of the early settlers have been interred in this\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nA few of them are: Dyer and Hiram Usher, Charles Dickey, John Garrison,\r\nPeter Davis Burt, Thomas Spencer, George Mathew, J. Z. Drake,\r\nCaldwells, the Rawson and Tweed families, F. Klumph, Mrs. Dyer Usher,\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\nDyer Usher as well as the other members of the Usher families was\r\nalways friendly with the Indians and in return shared the good will of\r\nthe various Indian tribes. In an early day one of the chieftains died\r\nand was buried in the cemetery lot of the whites according to the\r\nIndian customs. This brave was interred with bows and arrows as well as\r\nwith the dead carcass of a horse or Indian pony. Here the Indian brave\r\nhas slept for many moons, ready at the final day to join the good\r\nIndians on a fleet charger for the happy hunting ground in the by and\r\nby.\r\n\r\nIn the Wilcox cemetery, near Viola, Edward M. Crow and his two wives,\r\nmany old pioneers as well as old soldiers are laid to rest.\r\n\r\nShiloh cemetery, in Rapids township, has been the burial place for many\r\nyears of the old settlers in that part of the township.\r\n\r\nScotch Grove cemetery, near Fairfax, has also been used for many years\r\nand here are interred most of the old settlers who died in that part of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nThe Marion cemetery, the Lisbon cemetery, the Center Point cemetery,\r\nwhere is interred a Revolutionary soldier, as well as the Oak Hill\r\ncemetery in Cedar Rapids are all places where a large number of the old\r\nsettlers have been buried during the past fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe town cemeteries seem to be kept up while the country cemeteries are\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n_Early Experiences in Stage and Express_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne way to learn of the history of a city is by studying its\r\ndevelopments and the men who were its leaders in progressive\r\nenterprises and in things political. It is another phase of the matter,\r\nnone the less important, to study the lives of the men who did the\r\npersistent everyday work three hundred and sixty-five days in the year\r\nand sometimes, it seemed, almost twenty-four hours in a day. Cedar\r\nRapids was fortunate in having a large number of both classes of these\r\npioneers.\r\n\r\nAmong the latter class who worked steadily and everlastingly from the\r\ntime Cedar Rapids was a straggling little village to a city of its\r\npresent size and who aided materially in its upbuilding is W. Fred\r\nReiner, in the early fifties a stage driver out of this city, and for\r\nmany years after a messenger of the American Express company. It may be\r\nsafe to assume that Mr. Reiner handled as much money and bullion in\r\npioneer days as did any man in Linn county. His experiences were common\r\nto the stage driver and express messenger of the early day. How he\r\novercame one difficulty after another, escaped highwaymen, pulled\r\nhimself out of mud-holes, etc., as he interestingly relates, is what\r\nwas the life of the real pioneer of the early fifties and sixties. The\r\nevents which are most vivid in Mr. Reiner's mind are those which\r\noccurred after he became an express messenger for the American Express\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the _Republican_ for the following interesting\r\naccount of the experiences of Mr. Reiner in the stage and express\r\nbusiness:\r\n\r\nIt is fifty-three years since Mr. Reiner, at the age of eighteen, left\r\nhis home in Germany to risk his future in America. Coming west, he\r\nsettled for one year at Columbus, Ohio, then pushing still farther\r\nwest, he came to Iowa City in 1854. Here for a little while he did\r\nteaming and other work, then began driving stage between Marengo and\r\nIowa City. Soon he was driving for the Western Stage Company. In 1857,\r\nwhile in the employ of his company, he drove the first stage from\r\nCalamus, near Dewitt, at that time the terminus of the Chicago and\r\nNorthwestern Railroad, to this city. It was while on this route running\r\nto Calamus that Mr. Reiner first became acquainted with Conductor\r\nHolten, now of Des Moines, and well known all over Iowa as the oldest\r\nconductor in the employ of the Chicago and Northwestern.\r\n\r\nAfter working in this capacity for a while Mr. Reiner returned to Cedar\r\ncounty and took up farming. Soon coming back to Iowa City, he went to\r\nthe stage company's office and was immediately given a stage between\r\nthat place and Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nOne day while on his route he met at Solon the proprietor of the stage\r\ncompany coming from Iowa City with a four-horse stage. The new stage\r\ndrew up along where Mr. Reiner was, and the proprietor called, \"Fred, I\r\nwant you and your team.\" Wondering what was going to happen, Mr. Reiner\r\nimmediately unhitched his horses, and the driver of the leadhorses on\r\nthe other stage had also unhitched his. Mr. Reiner's team was put on as\r\nthe leadhorses, and he was told to get on the stage. While coming on\r\ninto this city the proprietor informed him that he was to run the new\r\nstage from this city to Springville, at that time the end of the\r\nDubuque and Southwestern railroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGH SCHOOL, CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER WAPSIE AT CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\nAs the railroad was pushed nearer and nearer Marion, the stage route\r\nbecame shorter and shorter, until it was finally between Cedar Rapids\r\nand the county seat. It was while driving between this city and Marion\r\nthat he began to carry express, and that in an unusual way. One of the\r\nexpress messengers who ran into the county seat and whose home was at\r\nthat place, had to accompany the express down to this city each night\r\non the stage. There being no return stage until morning, he was\r\ncompelled to spend the night in Cedar Rapids. He would very often ask\r\nMr. Reiner to take charge of the express at Marion and bring it to this\r\ncity. The express messenger was Dr. J. M. Ristine of this city, now one\r\nof the best known physicians in the state.\r\n\r\nOne day Supt. Thomas Adams, of the American Express company, was at\r\nMarion. He opened a conversation with Mr. Reiner in the course of which\r\nhe asked him if he would be willing to take a position as express\r\nmessenger on the western end of the Northwestern, at that time nearing\r\nthe city of Boone. Mr. Reiner took the matter under advisement, and\r\nlater accepted the position.\r\n\r\nGoing to Boone, Mr. Reiner was given the first express route from that\r\ncity through to Omaha. With the railroad stopping at Boone, and nothing\r\nmore than a mere trail to follow, with a few stopping places, this\r\nroute on to the Nebraska city was everything but pleasant. Nevertheless\r\nMr. Reiner took hold of the work, and on November 7, 1865, after\r\nforty-eight hours of almost continuous riding, he carried the first\r\nexpress ever hauled by the American Express company into the city of\r\nOmaha.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the last day a stop had been made at Council\r\nBluffs for breakfast, and when Mr. Reiner was ready to continue the\r\nregular stage had gone. The local agent hustled around and found a\r\ncarriage which he turned over to Mr. Reiner, so that the first express\r\nwhich the American Express ever took into Omaha did not go by stage,\r\nbut by carriage.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing delicate or easy in the route assigned to the new\r\nmessenger. He left Boone on Tuesday afternoon. The stage, by changing\r\nhorses at regular intervals, went steadily on during the afternoon and\r\nnight, and all the next day and night. Early Thursday morning it would\r\npull into Council Bluffs, where a stop for breakfast was made. The trip\r\nwas then continued to Omaha, which was reached during the forenoon.\r\nLeaving Omaha that same afternoon at four o'clock, the return trip was\r\ncommenced and kept up until Boone was reached at nine o'clock Saturday\r\nmorning. As Mr. Reiner had previously driven stage he was nearly always\r\nfound upon the seat with the driver. Thus he was exposed the same as\r\nthe driver was. Through all kinds of weather, the blizzards of winter\r\nand stifling heat of the summer, these trips were made with greatest\r\nregularity. Gradually, however, the railroad was worked farther and\r\nfarther westward, and the stage driver's route shortened accordingly.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of his life Mr. Reiner had many trying and sometimes\r\nexciting experiences. Although he is modest about relating them, those\r\nwhich he told a reporter illustrate what the messengers of that period\r\nhad to contend with.\r\n\r\n\"I remember one time,\" said Mr. Reiner, \"it was in the spring of the\r\nyear and the roads were in terrible condition. From Panora to Boone\r\nthere was one slough after another. We were driving along one night. I\r\nwas on the box with the driver, when we came to a wide slough. There\r\nwere tracks where others had driven through, but of course, we could\r\nnot go across in the same place for fear of cutting through. But the\r\nslough looked all right, so we started in a new place. We had got into\r\nthe center when suddenly the wheels cut through the sod and the stage\r\nsank into the water-soaked ground clear up to the axles. The four\r\nhorses began floundering around in a most dangerous manner. Both the\r\ndriver and I jumped from our seats down into the mud and water, and as\r\nsoon as possible unhitched the horses.\r\n\r\n\"There we were, stuck in the middle of the slough with nine passengers\r\non the inside of the coach, one of them a woman. They, of course, had\r\nbeen aroused by the disturbance, and now called loudly to know what\r\nthey should do. There was but one thing that could be done, and that\r\nwas to get out and wade to shore. This they did, one of the gentlemen\r\ncarrying the woman on his shoulders. They were told that if they would\r\nfollow the road for three miles they could find lodging for the night.\r\nA spring snow was on the ground, and the air was cold, but they started\r\non their way. The driver, capturing one of the horses, jumped on it and\r\nrode for help.\r\n\r\n\"I was left there alone. In the stage coach was my express containing\r\nsome very valuable property which I did not dare to leave under any\r\ncircumstances. There was but one thing for me to do, and that was to\r\nwade back to the stage coach and climb in and stay there until help\r\nshould arrive. This I did. I wrapped myself in my buffalo robe which\r\nwas the best I could do, but it was far from comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning help came and we were pulled out of the mud hole. A\r\nfresh set of horses was hitched to the stage and we were soon at the\r\nnext stop. Here we met all the passengers. They had had good beds to\r\nsleep in and warm breakfasts, so were anxious to be off. I hastily\r\nswallowed a cup of coffee, and still in my wet clothes, climbed up on\r\nthe box seat, and rode all that day and the next night without a rest.\r\nThis was but one of the experiences which were familiar to stage\r\ndrivers and express messengers of that time.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough during his twenty-five years of service for the American\r\nExpress company Mr. Reiner never lost a penny which had been placed in\r\nhis charge, it was not because he did not have his opportunities to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\"There was one experience,\" he remarked, \"that I remember well, and\r\nwhich came as near being a hold-up as I ever had. It was the same week\r\nthat an additional express messenger had been put on the route between\r\nBoone and Omaha, and our routes had been altered accordingly. The stage\r\nleft Boone on a Monday afternoon and was in the neighborhood of\r\nDenison. It was a bright night and the horses were jogging along at a\r\ngood gait.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly ahead the driver saw two men crouched by the roadside. As we\r\ndrew near they both sprang out into the road and began firing at us\r\nrapidly. One of the first shots struck and killed the rear horse on the\r\nleft hand side. The other three animals sprang forward with such force\r\nthat they fairly jerked the harness off from the animal which had been\r\nshot. They circled to the right and the wheels of the coach ran over\r\nthe fallen animal. The animals continued their circling until they\r\ncompletely reversed the coach, then they turned and ran down the road\r\nalong which we had just come. It was always believed that the\r\nhighwaymen did not know of this change, and thought the stage carried\r\nexpress as before. But the fact was I had left Boone on Monday instead\r\nof Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\"The driver, according to the story he told me afterwards, was cussed\r\nmost roundly for not stopping the team, but he insisted that the\r\nshooting the robbers had done so frightened the horses that they had\r\nbecome unmanageable. Although the highwaymen were far from satisfied\r\nwith the explanation they made the best of a bad matter, and began to\r\nsearch the driver to see what they could find. He gave them his\r\npocketbook, which, he said, contained forty dollars. That, by the way,\r\nis more money than I ever saw him have at one time, and considerably\r\nmore than stage drivers usually carried. The hold-up men took the money\r\nand gave the pocketbook back to him, as it contained some papers he\r\nwished to save and which were of no value to the robbers.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after this incident, while going over my route one cold night the\r\ndriver stopped the team and called to me. I sat in a seat on the inside\r\nwith my revolvers lying beside me. Getting out of the door, the driver\r\ntold me there was a man crouched down in the road ahead of us. We were\r\nout on the prairie some miles from a station. I went forward, with no\r\nfeeling of pleasure, to investigate. The man came forward also and I\r\nrecognized him as a fellow who had been lying around one of the\r\nstations for several days. I asked him what he wanted and he replied\r\nthat he wished to get in and ride for a ways. Although the night was\r\ncold I could not let him in for fear that he had companions farther up\r\nthe road and was only getting inside to get the lay of the land. The\r\nexpress was unusually valuable that night. The fellow ran along behind\r\nthe coach for some time, but the horses gradually outdistanced him, and\r\nthat was the last we ever saw of him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the railroad, Mr. Reiner was given a position\r\nas express messenger on one of the trains. \"Many times,\" said the\r\nveteran express messenger, \"I have literally had the car floor paved\r\nwith gold and silver, over which I walked in doing my work. We had\r\ncarried lots of gold and silver bars east from Virginia City, in\r\nNevada. In order that, the weight should be evenly distributed the bars\r\nwere spread like paving bricks all over the car floor. The following\r\ndescription, written by a reporter from one of the Council Bluffs\r\npapers while Mr. Reiner was yet at Boone, gives a description of the\r\nwork of carrying the bullion:\r\n\r\n\"While viewing the scenes at the transfer yesterday afternoon, we\r\nboarded W. F. Reiner's Northwestern express car and beheld a scene that\r\ncaused our hump of inquisitiveness to jump. Mr. Reiner is a messenger\r\nof the American Merchants Union Express company, and will have served\r\nin his present position and on his present route seven years in\r\nNovember next. He lives in Boone. On the floor of his car were\r\nsixty-seven gold and silver bricks. That is, each brick was composed of\r\ngold and silver in compound. In some of them, silver predominated--in\r\nvalue. They resemble silver almost entirely in color. They are of\r\nsomewhat irregular sizes, though nearly every one of them weighs more\r\nthan one hundred pounds. Some of them were much more refined than the\r\nothers. The amount of gold and silver in each one is stamped on the\r\nface or top, in different lines, and the total value of the brick is\r\nadded in a third line. The value of each metal is marked, even to a\r\ncent. How those values can be so accurately determined in a compound\r\nbrick is beyond our knowledge. Fifty-seven of those bricks which we\r\nyesterday saw, were worth $101,950.80. The remaining eleven were worth\r\n$15,077.57. They were mostly from Virginia City and are being taken to\r\nNew York. Mr. Reiner informed us also that these bricks are carried\r\nonly by the Northwestern and Rock Island roads. On some days he has had\r\nas many as 160 of them in his car. They are taken east nearly every\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nFor ten years Mr. Reiner lived in Boone, then a redivision of the road\r\nbrought him back to this city. For the next fifteen years he continued\r\nto run out of this city and do active service. Thirteen years ago the\r\nterrible strain he had undergone in the earlier years of service for\r\nthe company began to tell upon him and he broke down in health. Then,\r\nif a private company ever did a good and wise thing, the American\r\nExpress company did it. They said they realized the value that Mr.\r\nReiner had been to them when they were getting established in Iowa and\r\nrunning their route through to Omaha, and they would not forget his\r\nefficient services now that he was getting old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n_Linn County Libraries_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IOWA MASONIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\nBY HELEN R. DONNAN\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Masonic Library, \"unique in idea and unapproachable in scope,\"\r\nis an institution of which Cedar Rapids is proud, and to which the\r\nMasons of Iowa point as a satisfactory answer to those who would\r\nquestion the purposes of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1844 the late T. S. Parvin, grand secretary and librarian\r\nof the Grand Lodge of Iowa, A. F. & A. M., from its organization until\r\nhis death in 1901, began the collection of books which today is world\r\nfamous. With rare discernment and infinite patience this vast wealth of\r\ntreasures has been gathered together and placed at the disposal of all\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nThe library, for years housed at Muscatine, later in the Burtis Opera\r\nHouse at Davenport, was removed to Iowa City in the year 1867, where it\r\nremained in rooms rented for that purpose until 1883 when it had so far\r\noutgrown its quarters that a new and more permanent home was needed. At\r\nthe annual session of 1883, the Grand Lodge set aside $20,000.00 for a\r\nfireproof building, and, the citizens of Cedar Rapids having offered to\r\ndonate a lot and $10,000.00, it was decided to build in that city. The\r\nsite selected was ideal, fronting on one of the most beautiful avenues,\r\nin the residence district, yet within a few blocks of the business\r\nportion of the city. The front of the building, which is of red pressed\r\nbrick trimmed with sandstone, consists of two stories and an attic,\r\nwhile the rear part is two stories, and under all is a basement, well\r\nlighted and ventilated by a wide area-way. Surrounded by a well kept\r\nlawn and beautiful shade trees, it presents a very attractive\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nSo rapidly did the library grow that in 1901 the trustees were\r\nauthorized to purchase the adjoining corner lot on which was a fine\r\nbrick residence. This has since been used as a general reference\r\nlibrary and reading room, known as the Annex. Both buildings have\r\nrecently been improved and re-decorated until today one entering either\r\none finds \"a place of quiet and beauty, where sightseeing is a delight,\r\nand study an absolute pleasure.\" On the right of the main entrance is\r\nthe Grand Master's room, furnished in dark and massive oak, thoroughly\r\nin keeping with the dignity of the fraternity. On the left, a lighter\r\ntreatment in decoration and the mahogany furniture make the reception\r\nroom a delightful apartment in which the friends gather and are made\r\nwelcome. The fireproof doors at the end of the entrance hall open into\r\nthe library proper, filled with book cases on every side, and in the\r\ncenter of the room are large glass cases containing thousands of rare\r\nand interesting curios. The upper floor of this hall is a gallery\r\nguarded by an iron railing and lighted by the skylight above. This,\r\ntoo, is filled to overflowing with books and display cases. On the\r\nwalls of both rooms hang pictures of the long line of Grand Masters who\r\nhave ruled the craft in Iowa from 1844 to the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. S. PARVIN Long Grand Secretary Iowa Masons]\r\n\r\nThe leading feature of this library is naturally the Masonic\r\ndepartment. Here in cases adorned with meaning symbols are to be found\r\nall the standard works of the fraternity and those which later\r\nscholarship has contributed to the history, philosophy and ceremonial\r\nof Masonry, together with the proceedings of all Grand Lodges,\r\nChapters, Commanderies, Councils, Shrines, Chapters of the Order of\r\nEastern Star, and all Masonic organizations of the world. This\r\ndepartment also contains the constitutions, by-laws, monitors, and\r\nrituals of all Masonic bodies, both American and foreign. Masonic\r\nperiodicals and magazines from all parts of the globe are on the\r\nshelves in perhaps more complete sets than can be found in any other\r\nlibrary. Many rare and costly works have been added, some few of which\r\nare unique, no other copy being known to exist.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Freemasonry shows traces of the influence of other\r\nsecret societies, and it in turn has influenced almost every other\r\nsecret organization. A Masonic library would therefore be incomplete\r\nwithout the history, literature and ceremonies of these associations.\r\nThis semi-Masonic department includes all works bearing upon the secret\r\nsocieties of the American revolution, the early secret societies of the\r\nmiddle ages and France, works pertaining to the history of the\r\nNestorians, Dervishes, Thugs, Druids, Rosicrucians, the Guilds, etc.\r\n\r\nAs Masonry is closely linked with art, archaeology, mythology, and\r\nreligion, a large collection of this class of material finds place in\r\nthe general reference library, now housed in the Annex. The French and\r\nGerman books, comprising some four thousand volumes, the government\r\npublications, and a large number of proceedings have been removed to\r\nthe basement, while the attic is crowded with duplicate proceedings,\r\nmagazines, and pamphlets without number.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature is the Iowa department containing works by\r\nIowa authors, as well as all works pertaining to the history of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this collection of the greatest possible benefit to\r\nits patrons, it has been classified and a card catalog of the books has\r\nbeen made in accordance with approved library methods.\r\n\r\nFor the casual visitor the principal attraction is the museum, which\r\ncontains archaeological, mineralogical, and geological specimens from\r\nall parts of the country. Here the relics of ancient American races and\r\ntribes give evidence of prehistoric culture, while the ruder\r\nimplements, weapons and pottery of the aborigines make a notable\r\ncollection. One large case contains only weapons of warfare; another is\r\nfilled with Iowa birds. An unusual collection is the one of shoes from\r\nChina, Japan, India, Burma, Siam, and several other foreign lands. The\r\ncase of colonial relics is especially interesting to older visitors.\r\nThe book lover finds the case devoted to rare and beautifully bound\r\nbooks the supreme attraction, while the small boy enjoys the stamp\r\ncollection, the post card display, the birds, and the \"freaks\" of\r\nnature exhibited here. Masonic badges, medals, coins, old diplomas,\r\ncharters, manuscripts, aprons, and other old lodge paraphernalia are\r\nartistically displayed in the various glass cases. Scattered throughout\r\nboth buildings are many pictures, fine art pieces in bronze, bisque,\r\nand marble, antique vases, jars, pitchers, and various pieces of modern\r\npottery, all donated by friends of the library.\r\n\r\nIn the autograph letter department are three large double cases each\r\nhaving one hundred and forty glass covered drawers devoted exclusively\r\nto this material. Here may be found the signatures of noted literary\r\nmen, the presidents of the United States, governors of Iowa, and others\r\nprominently identified with the history of the state as well as noted\r\nmen of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, upon the death of T. S. Parvin, the founder of the\r\ninstitution, his son, Newton R. Parvin, was elected Grand Secretary and\r\nlibrarian. He is peculiarly fitted for this responsible position,\r\nhaving served as deputy to his father for twenty-five years, and, like\r\nhis father, is giving to the building up of this splendid library the\r\n\"enthusiasm and energy of a single-purposed life.\"\r\n\r\nN. R. Parvin being Grand Secretary as well as librarian, the\r\nheadquarters of the Grand Lodge are in the library building, and in the\r\nthree splendidly equipped vaults are stored many valuable papers and\r\nrecords. A card index giving the record of every member in the state\r\nhas recently been completed and placed in one of the vaults.\r\n\r\nThe entire expense of maintaining the library is met by an annual tax\r\nof ten cents for each member in the state. All expenditures are under\r\nthe supervision of a board of three trustees appointed by the Grand\r\nMaster for a term of six years. Those composing the present board are\r\nW. S. Gardner of Clinton, W. L. Eaton of Osage, and Crom Bowen of Des\r\nMoines.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nBY JOANNA HAGEY\r\n\r\nThe people of Cedar Rapids had felt the need of a public library. In\r\nthe seventies a subscription library was founded but it was forced to\r\ndiscontinue from lack of funds and the books were given to the Y. M. C.\r\nA. The City Federation of Ladies' Literary Clubs, and especially the\r\npresident, Mrs. C. D. Van Vechten, should be given the credit for\r\ncreating a sentiment that resulted in a vote of the people on March 2,\r\n1896, to establish a library.\r\n\r\nThe council appointed a library board in June. In October the first tax\r\nlevy was made, and they began the formation and organization of the new\r\nlibrary which was opened to the public January 15, 1897, in rooms in\r\nthe Granby block.\r\n\r\nThe work prospered and the patronage increased so that additional space\r\nwas needed, and in 1900 the library was moved to the Dows Auditorium.\r\n\r\nAgain larger quarters were demanded and it was deemed best for the city\r\nto own the library building. Mr. Andrew Carnegie generously gave\r\n$75,000, which was used for the erection of the beautiful and\r\ncommodious building on the corner of Fifth street and Third avenue. The\r\nnew building was dedicated June 23, 1905.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the growth of the library can be gained from the following\r\ncomparisons: When the library was opened there were 1,325 volumes on\r\nthe shelves. December 31, 1909, there were 19,505 volumes; 29,730 books\r\nwere circulated the first year, and 94,078 books last year; the\r\nreceipts the first year were $4,471.52; last year they amounted to\r\n$11,049.14.\r\n\r\nMrs. C D. Van Vechten, Mrs. Charles A. Clark, Mrs. N. M. Hubbard, Sr.,\r\nMiss Emma J. Fordyce, F. F. Dawley, A. T. Cooper, V. A. Jung, L. W.\r\nAnderson, and Luther A. Brewer constituted the first board of trustees.\r\nThe following are the present board: Mrs. Mary Ziek Andre, Mrs. Kate\r\nTerry Loomis, Miss Emma J. Fordyce, Miss Elizabeth Cock, B. L. Wick, L.\r\nW. Anderson, Frank Filip, C. M. Doan, and Sandford Kerr. Others who\r\nhave served as trustees are: Miss Meta Aussieker, Mrs. Ida M. Ballheim,\r\nMrs. Channie J. Redmond, H. H. Troy, Joseph Mekota, John Vosmek, J. M.\r\nTerry, J. T. Hamilton, W. I. Endicott, Jomes A. Molony, Robert Palmer,\r\nJohn W. Barry, and Theodore Schauwecker.\r\n\r\nMiss Virginia Dodge was librarian from 1896-1899, Miss Harriet L.\r\nMcCrory from 1899-1903, and Miss Harriet A. Wood from 1903-1910. The\r\npresent librarian is Miss E. Joanna Hagey.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOE COLLEGE LIBRARY\r\n\r\nCoe College at an early date owned a well selected text-book library.\r\nIt was generally conducted by one of the students. Many donations have\r\nbeen made, mostly by men connected with the Presbyterian ministry. The\r\nlarge library of Rev. James Knox was one of the early additions made.\r\nLater the Rev. George R. Carroll presented his valuable collection of\r\nbooks to the college. Many valuable books have been donated from time\r\nto time by members of the faculty, by students, and persons interested\r\nin the growth of the college.\r\n\r\nMiss Ida Dodd and Miss Cornelia Shelley served as librarians for some\r\nyears. Miss Mary Irene Amidon, by the assistance of several helpers,\r\nhas placed the library on a sound basis by a system of cataloguing\r\nwhich before had been neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE AND PUBLIC LIBRARY, MOUNT VERNON\r\n\r\nNo definite data can be given for the beginning of the library at Mount\r\nVernon, though in the catalogue of the Iowa Conference Seminary for\r\n1855 the statement is made that \"a small but good selection of books\r\nhas been procured to which students will have access.\" There seems to\r\nhave been a hesitancy about giving any number of volumes, till in the\r\ncatalogue of 1864-5 we read that \"the college library has about 600\r\nvolumes.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this early beginning the library very gradually grew in strength\r\nand helpfulness under the direction of various members of the college\r\nfaculty. The professors who served as librarians were: S. N. Fellows,\r\n1857-60, A. Collin, 1860-70, H. H. Freer, 1870-73, S. N. Williams,\r\n1873-91, W. C. Webster, 1891-93.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Miss May L. Fairbanks was appointed assistant librarian, and in\r\n1893 she was elected librarian, which position she still holds.\r\n\r\nA gift of $50,000 was obtained from Andrew Carnegie for a library\r\nbuilding for the town and college. In June, 1904, the corner stone of\r\nthe new building was laid, and in August, 1905, the college library,\r\nconsisting of 25,548 volumes, was moved into the new building.\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 1905, the library board of trustees was formally organized\r\nwith Dr. James E. Harlan as president. Prof. W. H. Norton, Col. H. H.\r\nRood, E. B. Willix, W. E. Platner, Prof. H. M. Kelly, Dr. A. Crawford,\r\nA. A. Bauman, J. B. Leigh.\r\n\r\nThere has been no change in the library board. The annual income is\r\n$5,000.\r\n\r\nThe library now consists of 33,900 volumes and many hundred pamphlets\r\nthat have not been numbered. The administration of the library\r\nresembles that of a college more than a public library, and no list of\r\nborrowers is kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\nMarion free public library dates from 1903. Miss Adaliza Daniels first\r\nbegan her work as early as 1902, to agitate for a Carnegie library. She\r\nand Mrs. C. N. Owen then began to solicit funds for a building site and\r\ncollected $3,775 for that purpose. The first board consisted of the\r\nfollowing: Messrs. Alderman, Alexander, Bowman, Treat, Mrs. Dobson,\r\nMrs. Busby, Mrs. Owen, Miss Tyler, and Miss Daniels. The present board\r\nconsists of J. W. Bowman, president, Dr. J. Morehead, vice-president,\r\nMrs. C. N. Owen, secretary, Mr. Wood, Miss Marshall, Mrs. B. C. Busby,\r\nMrs. Millen, and Mrs. Parkhurst.\r\n\r\nThe income of the library has varied from $1,100 to $1,350. There are\r\n800 card holders and more than 3,550 volumes in the library. The\r\nlibrarians have been Miss Mary Parkhurst and Miss Mabel Alexander.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOHEMIAN READING SOCIETY\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian Reading Society was organized November 22, 1868, at Cedar\r\nRapids, and some of the charter members who are still living are:\r\nAnthony Soukup, Frank Soukup, John Pichner, and John Safranek.\r\n\r\nMany of the pioneer settlers contributed from time to time largely of\r\ntheir means for the purchase of Bohemian books and tried to inculcate\r\nin their children a desire for the reading of books printed in their\r\nown tongue. Many foreign newspapers and magazines were also taken in\r\norder to keep up with the times and to create in the minds of the young\r\na love of the land of their fathers.\r\n\r\nThe average number of books loaned has been about 3,000 volumes a year.\r\nThe library being open to the members at stated times, much reading is\r\ndone in the library building, where a librarian is in charge. The\r\nnumber of bound books for circulation has been from 2,000 to 2,500\r\nvolumes. The expense of running the library outside of room rent, heat,\r\netc., has been from $200 to $300. Many donations of books and magazines\r\nare constantly being made.\r\n\r\nA few of the librarians have been the following named persons: Mrs.\r\nKabasa, Neibert and Stolba, Frank Kurka. The present librarian has\r\nserved continuously for the past sixteen years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEST ROWLEY STREET, WALKER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN STREET, PRAIRIEBURG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n_Wages and Prices in the County from 1846 to 1856_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the decade from 1846 to 1856 land was very cheap in Linn county,\r\nand everything else was in proportion. Wages were low, and what the\r\nfarmer raised on his premises he could find no market for, and,\r\nconsequently, outside of wheat it was pretty much worthless. The panic\r\nof 1857 was a severe one in the county, and many of the bankers and\r\nbusiness people met with severe reverses from which some never\r\nrecovered. No one had any foreboding of the financial storm and all\r\nwere caught short to such an extent that they lost nearly everything,\r\neven their homes which had been mortgaged. Many a business man with\r\ngood credit, possessed of considerable means, became swamped in the\r\ncrash. It mattered not what a man had in property, if it was not in\r\ngold it had no price, and there was no market for anything except on a\r\ncash basis.\r\n\r\nFrom N. B. Brown's account book we glean the following as to prices for\r\neatables in Cedar Rapids in 1846: Beef, 2-1/2c per pound, flour, 2c per\r\npound (1-1/2c in 1847), beans, 75c per bushel, veal, 3c per pound,\r\ncoffee, 14c per pound, sugar, 16-1/2c per pound, tea, $1.25 per pound,\r\nwheat 37-1/2c per bushel, corn meal, 25c per bushel, buckwheat flour,\r\n1-1/4c per pound. This interesting book is in the possession of Emery\r\nBrown, one of the sons.\r\n\r\nDuring the decade mentioned a horse sold at from fifty to sixty\r\ndollars, and a yoke of oxen could be had for the price of one good\r\nhorse. As many of the pioneer farmers had not the means to purchase a\r\nteam of horses, they did the next best thing and invested in a yoke of\r\noxen and thus managed to get along and weather the storm. A good wagon\r\nwith spring seat cost from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five\r\ndollars, and a log chain from two dollars and a half to five dollars.\r\nOrdinary stirring plows sold at from ten to fifteen dollars. Mowers and\r\nreapers were not common in those days, the scythe and the cradle being\r\nthe tools with which the young boy earned some of his first spending\r\nmoney. It was surprising how much hay and grain a good farm hand could\r\ncut in a season in this way.\r\n\r\nThe people dealt in log houses in those days like we do in second hand\r\nfurniture today. These houses were bought and sold at from fifty to\r\nseventy-five dollars each and moved at leisure in the winter time from\r\none part of the township to another; at times a log house was moved\r\nfrom ten to fifteen miles and everyone chipped in and helped to move. A\r\njug of whiskey, some hot coffee, and a good dinner were all they\r\nexpected in the way of remuneration for their labor. The young folks at\r\ntimes insisted on a free for all dance and a free fiddler for the\r\nassistance they had rendered in moving and fixing up the house. If the\r\nyoung married couple who were to occupy the house did not dance or\r\nbelieve in dancing, a party or two were given, ending up with a\r\nmidnight supper.\r\n\r\nWhile the prices of government land was one dollar and twenty-five\r\ncents an acre, the speculator land generally sold at from five to ten\r\ndollars and as high as twelve dollars and fifty cents an acre. Wages\r\nwere very low, from fifty to seventy-five cents a day being the average\r\nprice paid a good farm hand. In town a person generally received from\r\nseventy-five cents to a dollar a day and then boarded himself.\r\n\r\nOats sold at fifteen cents a bushel, corn at ten cents, wheat at from\r\nforty-five to sixty cents. Hogs sold at one dollar and fifty cents a\r\nhundred. Potatoes were considered high at ten cents a bushel, while\r\nquail sold at thirty cents a dozen. Butter brought from five to six\r\ncents a pound, and eggs six to eight cents a dozen.\r\n\r\nWhile prices for farm products were quite low the prices paid for the\r\nnecessaries of life were high on account of lack of transportation\r\nfacilities. Coffee sold at ten cents a pound, sugar at from eleven to\r\ntwelve cents, tea retailed at eighty-five cents. Calico sold at forty\r\ncents a yard--and a poor quality at that. Salt in the early days sold\r\nat ten dollars a barrel, the price coming down in Cedar Rapids to five\r\ndollars when W. B. Mack brought his first cargo of salt by steamer from\r\nOhio to Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nNearly all worked on shares, land was rented on shares, grist mills\r\noperated on shares, as well as saw mills. Masons and carpenters had to\r\ntake their wages out frequently in form of property, and, while they\r\nwere hard up and needed the money, this property in time made many of\r\nthem wealthy men by their retaining what had been turned over to them\r\nin the form of wages. Old Thomas McGregor relates how he worked for a\r\ncontractor by the name of Robinson and was offered lots where the mills\r\nof the Quaker Oats Company now stand at ten dollars a lot to apply on\r\nhis wages, and when the writer inquired why he did not take these lots\r\nhe replied: \"My wages were seventy-five cents a day, on which I had to\r\nkeep a wife and children, and they were more to me than corner lots.\"\r\nOld James Cleghorn worked for the Greene Bros. in the saw mill and was\r\noffered corner lots, and finally obtained in trade a forty acre tract\r\nof land in Scotch Grove for his summer's work. Old Elias Skinner, the\r\nwell known Methodist preacher, in the early fifties traded a team,\r\nharness and wagon for a forty acre tract on what is now the location of\r\nthe town of Norway, and at the time thought that the man who got the\r\nteam had the best of the bargain, as there was no market for land and\r\nno income from it, while with a team of horses a man could make\r\nsomething and always could trade it for something else if he wanted to.\r\nMoney was a scarce article in those days, while labor was cheap and the\r\ndays were long. It was generally work from sun up to sun down and\r\nsometimes until way after dark, and no one was heard to complain,\r\nbecause if a person did complain there were always plenty of others\r\nwilling to take the place of the man who wanted to quit.\r\n\r\nThere were not many varieties of food in the good old days, but the\r\npeople were healthy, they worked hard and everything tasted good. The\r\nordinary dishes were Indian corn, corn bread, hominy, corn dodgers,\r\nbacon, venison, and prairie chickens. The cooking was done by an open\r\nfireplace, stoves in those days being few. Rye coffee was used\r\nfrequently instead of the ordinary coffee and tasted good after a long\r\nday's hard labor in the timber. Many a thrifty housewife worked for\r\nweeks to dry corn in the fall of the year, as well as to dry apples;\r\nhominy was also made at home. All these delicacies--so-called--tasted\r\ngood during the winter months and no one was known to be afflicted with\r\nptomaine poisoning.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of grist mills coffee mills were used for the grinding\r\nof corn and wheat. In some instances a few of the early settlers used\r\nthe Indian stones, turned by hand; later horse mills were erected,\r\nwhich the early settlers thought were great inventions. These mills\r\nconsisted merely of an enclosure of logs with a large wheel in the\r\nmiddle around which a leather belt was placed, which was also attached\r\nto a smaller wheel which turned the mill stones and ground the corn.\r\nThe pioneers would come several miles to such a mill and sometimes had\r\nto wait a day or more in order to get their grist ground. They would\r\nhelp run the mill, would sleep in the wagon at night and live on\r\nparched corn on the trip; if a cup of coffee could be obtained at the\r\nstopping place the settler would be more than gratified.\r\n\r\nWhile the settlers raised almost all their provisions, they also made\r\nmost of what they had to wear. In a very cheap sort of a way they\r\ntanned their own leather and made their own shoes; in short, relied on\r\ntheir own ingenuity for nearly all the comforts of life.\r\n\r\nThe women folks were as handy as the men, if not more so, for they were\r\nall spinsters, dressmakers and tailors; they made the blue hunting\r\nshirts with fringes, adorned the buckskin belt which was worn around\r\nthe waist, and also cut out the tight fitting cotton blouses worn by\r\nthe boys, and even made moccasins and a coarse kind of brogan shoes.\r\nThey were furriers as well, for they made some excellent fitting wolf\r\nskin caps for the men and some neat looking gingham bonnets, well\r\nstarched, for themselves. While the shoes were at times heavy and ill\r\nfitting, they were only worn on Sundays and during the winter, for as\r\nsoon as spring came nearly everyone went barefoot, about the house at\r\nleast, for the sake of economy as well as for comfort.\r\n\r\nDuring these pioneer years in the forties and fifties our ancestors did\r\nnot have an easy time of it by any means. They endured the hardships of\r\npioneer life and were subject to fevers, as well as homesickness, and\r\nfrequently during the winter months they were exposed to the severity\r\nof the early Iowa winters when the log houses were both small and\r\nuncomfortable, but they were men and women of iron nerve, full of push\r\nand energy and perseverance. They had taken up a tedious battle for\r\nexistence out on the barren prairies of Iowa, far away from home and\r\nkindred, and, at times, surrounded by wild frontiersmen, freebooters\r\nand ruffians who were making a last stand in these parts of Iowa until\r\nthe opening up of the vast barren tracts west of the Missouri river. It\r\nwas not until after the Civil war that the people of Linn county\r\nbecame, so to speak, comfortably well fixed and had some of the\r\ncomforts which they had so long looked for during the early years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n_Some of the First Things in Cedar Rapids and Linn County_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first log cabin was erected on the site of what became Cedar\r\nRapids, by Osgood Shepherd or Wilbert Stone in 1838. The first frame\r\nhouse was erected by John Vardy in 1842, and the first brick building\r\nwas erected by Porter W. Earle at the corner of First avenue and Second\r\nstreet in 1844.\r\n\r\nP. J. Upton, of the Star Wagon Company, received a carload of freight\r\non the first freight train that ever came to Cedar Rapids; this was in\r\n1859. W. B. Mack received the first cargo of salt on the steamboat\r\n\"Cedar Rapids\" in 1855, bringing down the price of salt from $10.00 to\r\n$5.00 a barrel.\r\n\r\nThe first steamboat company, incorporated for $20,000.00, was organized\r\nin 1855, some of the incorporators being Alex. Ely, Dr. S. D.\r\nCarpenter, the Greenes, and other business men of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe first grist mill was built by N. B. Brown in 1843. Isaac Cook was\r\nthe first lawyer locating in Cedar Rapids; John Shearer was the first\r\njustice of the peace, and James Lewis was the first constable. The\r\nfirst general store was opened by George and Joseph Greene in 1842.\r\nJudge George Greene taught one of the first schools near Ivanhoe in\r\n1839 and 1840. Alexander Ely, George Greene, and N. B. Brown, with\r\nothers, erected the first school house in 1847 in Cedar Rapids, later\r\nselling it to the school district.\r\n\r\nJoseph Greene was the first postmaster in Cedar Rapids and carried the\r\nmail in his plug hat and distributed the same as he happened to meet\r\nthe people to whom the letters were addressed.\r\n\r\nDr. S. H. Tryon was the first physician in Linn county. Dr. E. L.\r\nMansfield was one of the first physicians locating in Cedar Rapids, in\r\n1847. H. W. Gray was the first sheriff of Linn county, being appointed\r\nby Governor Lucas in 1838. The first county fair was held in October,\r\n1855. The first hotel was built in 1847, called the Union House, James\r\nDyer being landlord; this building was destroyed by fire in 1865.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 W. D. Watrous, W. W. Smith, and J. J. Snouffer built the\r\nsteamer \"Blackhawk\" for the purpose of navigating the Cedar river. It\r\nran between Cedar Rapids and Waterloo for two years. It was later\r\npurchased by the government and used for a supply boat on the lower\r\nMississippi. In the '40s and '50s Mississippi steamboats made regular\r\ntrips to Cedar Rapids. The first railroad reached Cedar Rapids in 1859;\r\nit is now known as the Chicago & Northwestern.\r\n\r\nThe first fire company was organized in Cedar Rapids in 1869. In 1871\r\nthe Cedar Rapids Gas Light Company was organized. The first mayor of\r\nCedar Rapids was Martin L. Barber.\r\n\r\nThe first steam mill in the county was built by J. P. Glass in 1845.\r\nThe first hand-raking reaper brought into Linn county was by William\r\nUre, of Fairfax township, who hauled it from Chicago by oxen in the\r\nsummer of 1847.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper in Cedar Rapids was the _Progressive Era_,\r\npublished in 1851 by D. O. Finch; the first newspaper in Marion was the\r\n_Prairie Star_, published by A. Hoyt in 1852; the first daily newspaper\r\npublished in Linn county was called the _Morning Observer_, the first\r\nnumber being issued on September 1, 1870, and edited by Thomas G.\r\nNewman and Z. Enos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN STREET, SPRINGVILLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUAKER MEETING HOUSE, WHITTIER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITTIER]\r\n\r\nN. B. Brown erected the first flour mill in 1844; the first woolen mill\r\nwas erected in 1848. The first judge of probate in the county was\r\nIsrael Mitchell, appointed in 1838. He was also one of the justices.\r\n\r\nThe first bridge erected across the Cedar river in Cedar Rapids was in\r\n1856 at what is now Seventh avenue. The oldest settler now living in\r\nthe county is Robert Ellis, who arrived in 1838.\r\n\r\nThe first marriage in Linn county was that of Preston Scott and Miss\r\nBetsey Martin, which occurred in July, 1839.\r\n\r\nThe first white male born in Linn county was George Cone, who first saw\r\nlight at Marion, April 12, 1839.\r\n\r\nThe first death in the county was that of Mr. Williams, who died\r\nJanuary 15, 1839. He was buried in the Campbell cemetery near Bertram.\r\nThe inscription on his tombstone is yet visible.\r\n\r\nThe first mill was erected by John S. Oxley in 1842-43 on Big creek. It\r\nwas later purchased by Jacob Mann.\r\n\r\nThe first citizen to become naturalized was Peter Garren who, during\r\nthe October term of court, 1840, as a native of Scotland, renounced all\r\nallegiance to the queen of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nJames E. Bromwell, who came to Linn county in 1839, will always be\r\nremembered by the residents of Marion. He helped lay out the county\r\nseat. He made the first coffin for the first interment in its cemetery,\r\nassisted in the erection of the first residence in the town, as well as\r\nin the erection of the first store buildings, besides taking time\r\nenough to procure the second marriage license issued in the county for\r\nhis marriage to Catherine Gray, on August 26, 1841.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bennett, a native of Syracuse, New York, who had been reared\r\nin Canada and married to Edward Crow, November 14, 1839, is supposed to\r\nhave been the first school teacher in the county. She died in Buffalo\r\ntownship February 5, 1844.\r\n\r\nThe first white child born within the confines of Linn county was Maria\r\nOsborn, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Osborn, and was born in\r\nSeptember, 1838. This statement has often been disputed and cannot be\r\nproved with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST GRIST MILL\r\n\r\nThere has been more or less controversy as to the name of the man who\r\nerected the first grist mill in Linn county. Marshall Oxley insists\r\nthat the first mill of this kind was built by John S. Oxley in 1842-43.\r\nIt was located in the northwest corner of Linn township on Big creek.\r\nThe material used was grown in the immediate vicinity. The dimension\r\nlumber was hewn out of the forest and the roofing was made of\r\nclapboard, then the primitive material used by the pioneers in covering\r\ntheir buildings. The machinery was purchased in Davenport and\r\ntransported by wagon across the prairies. Before the erection of this\r\nmill the early settlers were compelled to take their grists to what was\r\nknown as the Catfish mill near Dubuque. Frequently it required several\r\ndays to go to the mill and to return home with the flour. Sometimes the\r\ngood housewives ran short of flour while the meal was being ground. In\r\nsuch cases they would grind a little corn in the coffee mills, mix it\r\nwith salt and water, cook it, and thank Providence that they lived in a\r\nland flowing with hoe cake, milk and honey.\r\n\r\nAfter the mill had been in successful operation some time two well\r\ndressed gentlemen called at the home of the owner and asked to be given\r\nentertainment for the night. Their request was cheerfully complied\r\nwith. Next morning they strolled down to the mill and looked it over.\r\nAfter they had been hospitably entertained and were about to depart\r\nthey represented that one was a patentee and the other a lawyer and\r\nthat the owner was using an infringement on their patent. They told him\r\nthat if he did not pay them forty dollars they would prosecute him to\r\nthe full extent of the law. He paid them the sum asked but remarked\r\nafterwards that he guessed he should have given them a charge of shot.\r\n\r\nThe mill was operated in successful manner by the miller, Jacob Mann,\r\nuntil August 15, 1848, when he purchased the property for $500. He\r\ncontinued to operate it until it was swept away by the flood of 1851,\r\nMann at this time losing his life in the flood.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW OF THE EARLY ENTRIES TO LAND\r\n\r\nA number of people resided in the county and were, so to speak,\r\n\"squatters\" before the land was opened for settlement and entry could\r\nbe made. A few of the following names and locations will give the\r\nreader an idea of some of the old settlers who came here, some of whom\r\nresided on their respective claims before entry could be made.\r\n\r\nPeter Kepler entered land in section 1-82-5 June 15, 1842; A.

They\r\ndid not come to the county because communities in the east were glad to\r\nbe rid of them. It was for far different reasons our pioneer men and\r\nwomen made their homes here. They looked upon this as a goodly land,\r\none filled with opportunity, and they entered in and occupied it.\r\n\r\nMrs. R. C. Rock, now in her 83d year, has vivid recollections of\r\nbeginnings in Linn county. She came overland from Dubuque in 1850, and\r\never since has called Cedar Rapids her home. She says in her first\r\nyears here the people took the best magazines of the day, passing them\r\naround so that all might read them. In 1852 there was organized a\r\nliterary circle of ladies and gentlemen. This circle met once a week at\r\nthe homes of the members. Original papers were read at these meetings,\r\nthe subjects being assigned in advance. Occasionally distinguished\r\nlecturers from abroad were obtained. On one occasion Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes was here, giving an entertaining talk to a large audience on the\r\n\"Great Pyramids.\" Judge Williams, of Muscatine, one of the original\r\nmembers of the supreme court of the state, was also a lecturer here.\r\nFrom time to time Dr. J. F. Ely, Judge Greene, and other local men read\r\npapers or made addresses, \"and they were always of a high order,\" says\r\nMrs. Rock.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there were formal parties, as in these days. There was a\r\ngreater amount of entertaining a half century or more ago here than\r\nthere is now. There were no special distinctions of class, all the\r\ncitizens were welcomed. Some of the most hospitable homes were those of\r\nthe southern colony, mentioned in another chapter in this book. Dr. and\r\nMrs. Ely entertained a great deal in their home located where now\r\nstands the old Post Office building. Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Bever were\r\nalways hospitable, and the Greenes did their share. Mrs. Rock says\r\nnothing as to her own entertaining in these days, but her home was\r\nrecognized as one of most cordial hospitality, refinement and culture.\r\nCol. W. H. Merritt, Gabriel Carpenter, William Greene, Lawson Daniels\r\nand their wives were also pleasant and hospitable entertainers.\r\n\r\nMrs. George C. Haman, whose husband by the way is the oldest business\r\nman in this city--oldest in point of continuous service--wrote in 1906\r\nquite interestingly for the _Republican_ her recollections of society\r\nin Cedar Rapids in the early days. We take the liberty of reproducing\r\nthe same here. It is a vivid picture of social doings a half century\r\nand more ago.\r\n\r\n     Society in the early days had one pleasant feature that we\r\n     do not have at the present time. There was only one social\r\n     circle and there was not so much society to the square inch\r\n     as there is now. It was before the days of parties with the\r\n     men left out and before the days of clubs and cliques. A\r\n     large social function meant all the social people in town,\r\n     and was thoroughly enjoyed by all, and nothing but sickness\r\n     or death kept any away. The first social affair I attended\r\n     was in '57. Even then Cedar Rapids enjoyed a social\r\n     reputation equal to any town in the state and it soon took\r\n     the lead with such families for social leaders as those of\r\n     Judge Greene, Dr. J. F. Ely, S. C. Bever, Gabriel Carpenter,\r\n     Colonel Merritt, William Greene, Lawson Daniels and a few\r\n     others, who believed that money-getting should not be the\r\n     only aim in life, and believed in a high standard of social\r\n     and literary enjoyment as well.\r\n\r\n     The social, literary and religious foundation laid by these\r\n     far-seeing men and women is what gave Cedar Rapids the\r\n     prestige it enjoys among the sister cities of the state. Of\r\n     course in the forties and fifties most of the entertainments\r\n     were simple, but there were red letter days. The first large\r\n     social affair I attended was a wedding, and the first\r\n     wedding I ever attended. It was the marriage of Miss\r\n     Carpenter, daughter of Gabriel Carpenter, to Mr. George\r\n     Weare, brother of the late John Weare and Mr. Charles Weare.\r\n     The bride was lovely. The groom was a young business man of\r\n     Sioux City, where they have lived ever since. The wedding\r\n     banquet was a feast of all the good things that a good\r\n     housewife could prepare, and Mrs. Carpenter was famous for\r\n     her culinary achievements. Her turkey dinners brought joy to\r\n     many friends. She is now in her eighties, and lives a\r\n     retired life.\r\n\r\n     While writing the account of this wedding I received a paper\r\n     giving the account of the wedding of a granddaughter of this\r\n     bride and groom.\r\n\r\n     The second social affair that stands out prominently in my\r\n     memory is a large party given by Dr. and Mrs. Ely. The\r\n     social functions given at this hospitable home were always\r\n     delightful. The genial personality of the host and hostess\r\n     pervaded every corner of the home, and when one entered its\r\n     portals one knew that Dr. and Mrs. Ely would give a cordial\r\n     welcome. It was a home where all of the new-comers were\r\n     always entertained, the latch-string always being out. Mrs.\r\n     Ely was a very philanthropic woman, was the leader of all of\r\n     the charitable works for many years. Under her leadership\r\n     many of the philanthropic women of today received their\r\n     early training. Her noble works gave them their incentive.\r\n     There were not so many spacious homes as now, but those who\r\n     had them dispensed hospitality most generously and in a way\r\n     not surpassed in these days.\r\n\r\n     The home of S. C. Bever, for many years the largest, stood\r\n     where the Rock Island offices now stand. This home was where\r\n     the bishops and other clergy of the Episcopal church were\r\n     always entertained while in town. This home, with its large\r\n     family of young people that drew like spirits, was the\r\n     source of many gaieties. Mr. and Mrs. Bever's hospitality\r\n     many times won financial success for Cedar Rapids. They\r\n     entertained strangers who came to spy out the land. One\r\n     occasion of this kind was in '55, when Judge Greene, Dr.\r\n     Ely, John Weare, Lowell Daniels, W. W. Walker, S. D.\r\n     Carpenter and S. C. Bever all went to Chicago to attend a\r\n     national republican convention. All being business men, ever\r\n     ready to build up Cedar Rapids, at this convention they made\r\n     it their business to meet men from New York and Boston and\r\n     to talk up the advantages of Iowa and what a railroad could\r\n     do, until Mr. Ames of Boston, Crocker, Bertram and others\r\n     came back with the Cedar Rapids delegation, and were taken\r\n     in conveyance through central Iowa. While the men were\r\n     working the eastern capitalists for a railroad the women all\r\n     got busy and prepared for a reception and dance at the home\r\n     of S. C. Bever. Some baked cakes, others prepared meats,\r\n     others the bread and others the ice cream. The whole town\r\n     was invited, so when the eastern men returned, they were won\r\n     completely over and the project of the first railroad into\r\n     Cedar Rapids was laid then and there.\r\n\r\n     Homes were often called upon to open their doors to\r\n     strangers in town, who often were induced by the warm\r\n     hospitality and good fellowship to invest their money and\r\n     join hands and build up Cedar Rapids. When a large function\r\n     was given all the friends assisted. Dishes and table linen\r\n     and services were offered. We could not hire a caterer to\r\n     come and prepare refreshments and serve a company. Our\r\n     friends were the helpers.\r\n\r\n     The home of William Greene was also one with open doors. It\r\n     stood on the corner of Third street and B avenue. It was not\r\n     a large house, but a very hospitable one. Later William\r\n     Greene built a beautiful house in the block where A. C.\r\n     Taylor, Dr. Ruml and Dr. Kegley now live. The grounds\r\n     covered the whole block and were laid out with landscape\r\n     effect. It was a beautiful place, and many fine\r\n     entertainments were given there.\r\n\r\n     The Higley brothers, Harvey, Wellington, Mort and Henry, in\r\n     the early days, lived in small homes, but that did not deter\r\n     them from keeping up their end of social life. Lucy and\r\n     Jennie Higley were fine cooks and charming hostesses. Mort\r\n     and Wellington were jolly good fellows and every one knew\r\n     they were sure of a pleasant time when invited to their\r\n     homes, no matter whether it was to a church social, or a big\r\n     \"standup\" party as they were called in those days.\r\n\r\n     S. L. Dows' first home was like those of the rest of the\r\n     pioneers, small, but hearts were large and no one extended a\r\n     more cordial welcome to their friends than Mr. and Mrs.\r\n     Dows. After they built their new home on First avenue, many\r\n     brilliant affairs were given by them.\r\n\r\n     The home of George C. Haman, on the corner of A avenue and\r\n     Fifth street, is an old land mark. Mr. and Mrs. Haman have\r\n     lived there for over forty years. Their children were born\r\n     and brought up there, and like many pioneer homes, it has\r\n     been the scene of many festivities and good times.\r\n\r\n     The home of the late John Weare, with its large family of\r\n     young people, will always be remembered by the old settlers.\r\n\r\n     The home of Mr. and Mrs. Belt, now owned by Mrs. George W.\r\n     Bever, was the scene of many enjoyable house parties.\r\n     Friends from eastern cities and prominent people throughout\r\n     Iowa were entertained there. Mrs. Belt loved to entertain\r\n     the clergy.\r\n\r\n     The entertainments given by Judge and Mrs. Greene were the\r\n     crowning social events of early days. The home and estate\r\n     were outside of town, but that was no obstacle to their\r\n     entertaining. Judge Greene was ready for every emergency and\r\n     the home was characteristic of the man. He was broadminded,\r\n     warm hearted, foresighted, generous and philanthropic, and\r\n     his home was conducted on these plans. His first house on\r\n     his beautiful estate, Mound Farm, was not large, but he\r\n     always found a way to entertain his friends and visitors to\r\n     Cedar Rapids. For example, he had a house party of friends\r\n     and wished Cedar Rapids people to meet them. He was at the\r\n     time building some buildings to shelter his sheep, of which\r\n     he had a great many. So he put floors in the building\r\n     preparatory to entertaining his guests and friends. He found\r\n     on short notice that if he expected to have the only good\r\n     music in town he must take it next day. He and Mrs. Greene\r\n     talked the matter over and decided to have the party. They\r\n     sent word to the other members of the Greene family and\r\n     intimate friends what they expected to do and they all came\r\n     to their assistance. Early in the morning Mrs. Belt made out\r\n     the list and the family delivered the invitations. Mrs. Belt\r\n     and Mrs. William Greene baked all the cakes. I don't know\r\n     just how many picked strawberries, but Mrs. Greene told me\r\n     that eighty quarts were picked and hulled that day. Mrs.\r\n     Greene superintended the making of the ice cream and the\r\n     decorating of the building. Special train service over the\r\n     Dubuque and Southwestern was arranged to bring the guests\r\n     from a central point to the sheep pens. All was in readiness\r\n     and the host and hostess ready to receive their guests at\r\n     eight o'clock. It was a most enjoyable event, and is still\r\n     recalled with pleasure by the old settlers. It is safe to\r\n     say that with the conveniences of today, such a social\r\n     affair could not be gotten up in one day. Later when Judge\r\n     Greene built his large house on the crowning point of Mound\r\n     Farm, in the center of the beautiful grounds which he had\r\n     been ten or more years preparing, Mr. Paddington, an English\r\n     gardener, had it in charge. Every kind of shrub and tree\r\n     that could be grown in Iowa was planted. The place for\r\n     situation and beauty could not be equaled in Iowa, and the\r\n     grounds were the most beautiful. When Judge Greene had the\r\n     walls up and ready to roof, a tornado tore them down. But\r\n     notwithstanding this discouragement, his house was built\r\n     and furnished with the richest furnishings of those days.\r\n     Three thousand dollars worth of oil paintings hung on the\r\n     walls. All the furnishings were bought in New York City.\r\n     When all was complete, he opened it with a most brilliant\r\n     house warming. As Judge Greene always considered Cedar\r\n     Rapids and her citizens in whatever he did, all were bidden,\r\n     as were many of his friends throughout the state, to the\r\n     opening of his new house. The beautiful impression of the\r\n     illuminated grounds and house and the cordial hand-clasp of\r\n     welcome from host and hostess that thrilled each guest with\r\n     good fellowship and heartfelt appreciation were never\r\n     forgotten. Indeed it was an evening of rare pleasure.\r\n\r\n     There were a few years when fancy dress parties were all the\r\n     rage. The first one given was in the home of Colonel Merritt\r\n     and was novel and beautiful. Colonel and Mrs. Merritt were\r\n     charming entertainers. Colonel Merritt built the house where\r\n     Dr. J. H. Smith now lives. It was bought by John W.\r\n     Henderson. He and his handsome and cordial wife entertained\r\n     hospitably. After Dr. Smith owned the house, he and his wife\r\n     dispensed hospitality lavishly and state politicians were\r\n     often their guests.\r\n\r\n     The Daniels home was another of the hospitable homes, where\r\n     many large parties were given especially for the pleasure of\r\n     the younger set.\r\n\r\n     The home of Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Cook was for several years\r\n     the largest and most modern in the city. Mrs. Cook, with her\r\n     charming daughters, gave many elegant parties. The house was\r\n     built by I. N. Isham. He only occupied it for a few years\r\n     and sold it to H. G. Angle, who lived there one year. J. S.\r\n     Cook then bought it and lived there many years. Now it is\r\n     used for the National hotel annex.\r\n\r\n     In the home of Mr. and Mrs. A. R. West, children as well as\r\n     their older friends, found a warm welcome. The little folks\r\n     loved to congregate there and entertainment and refreshments\r\n     were always provided for them. \"Papa and Mama West,\" as the\r\n     children called them, were never too busy to answer all the\r\n     questions asked by their young friends, who were always made\r\n     to feel thoroughly at home.\r\n\r\n     The home of Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Rock was one of hospitality\r\n     and of culture and refinement, as well. No woman ever did so\r\n     much toward the education of the young people in early days\r\n     as Mrs. Rock. She was also a great worker in the church and\r\n     is the only living charter member of Grace Episcopal church.\r\n\r\n     The first church wedding was in the little Second\r\n     Presbyterian church. It was the marriage of Mr. George C.\r\n     Haman and Miss Louise Wolf. It was at five o'clock in the\r\n     morning, and the wedding breakfast was at 4 o'clock. The\r\n     reason for having the wedding at this unseemly hour was that\r\n     the bride and groom were going east and there was only one\r\n     train a day left town, and that was at six in the morning.\r\n     The attendants at the wedding were Mrs. M. P. Mills, nee\r\n     Coulter; Mrs. Portus B. Weare nee Risley; Mrs. Taylor, nee\r\n     Earl, and Miss Carpenter, bridesmaids. The groomsmen were\r\n     Mr. James L. Bever, Mr. Carter Berkley, Mr. Mortimer A.\r\n     Higley and Dr. Lions.\r\n\r\n     The first large public affair in Cedar Rapids that gathered\r\n     together all the people of the town, all in the state who\r\n     could get here and some from Chicago and the east, was in\r\n     June, '59. The occasion was the completion of the first\r\n     railroad into Cedar Rapids. It was the Chicago, Iowa and\r\n     Nebraska, now the Chicago & Northwestern. The citizens had\r\n     looked forward to this for many years, and it was a\r\n     financial struggle to get it through, but when it was\r\n     completed there was great rejoicing. A great celebration was\r\n     given. The tables for the banquet were spread where now\r\n     stands the Masonic Library, and the George B. Douglas home.\r\n     The women prepared all the edibles and with the assistance\r\n     of the young men and girls, served the banquet. The men took\r\n     charge of the speeches, parade and music. The depot was then\r\n     in the lower end of town, about Twelfth avenue and Fourth\r\n     street. The speeches were made there. At the finish the\r\n     marshals of the day formed all in line and marched to the\r\n     grove where the banquet was spread, and it is needless to\r\n     say the feast was enjoyed. I fear there were not twelve\r\n     baskets full left. The climax of the occasion was a ball\r\n     given at Daniels's hall, that stood where the Masonic Temple\r\n     now stands. It was a brilliant affair and the dancers tipped\r\n     the light fantastic toe until the rosy dawn was breaking.\r\n     The weary dancers wended their way home on foot, the girls\r\n     in tarlatan gowns and white kid slippers. Public carriages\r\n     were scarce, and the new and only bus had gone to meet the\r\n     early train. Thus ended the largest public social event up\r\n     to that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER WAGON BRIDGE, CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENDERSON BRIDGE AT CENTRAL CITY]\r\n\r\n     The years from '61 to '65 were years of great anxiety and\r\n     all the entertainments given were to gather the forces to\r\n     make all we could to get delicacies for our soldiers who\r\n     were fighting in the Civil war. The women, as always, did\r\n     their part. Mrs. Ely, with her loving heart and her capable\r\n     leadership, directed the younger women. Dramatic\r\n     entertainments were given by the young people. I recall some\r\n     of those who took part: The Misses Carrie and Kate Ely, Dr.\r\n     Lions, William Berkley, J. H. Haman, Miss Laura Weare, the\r\n     Misses Coulter, Miss Earl, Miss Risley, Mrs. Dr. May,\r\n     William Baker, Mr. and Mrs. Haman, Hall, Wood, Stibbs, and\r\n     Carroll. The rest of the men had all gone to the war and\r\n     most of these finally went. Sociables and fairs were then\r\n     held to raise money. There were days and nights of sewing\r\n     and packing barrels to be sent to the seat of war. These\r\n     were the days when all personal sacrifice was a pleasure.\r\n     When the war was over and the pall of horror was lifted, the\r\n     first joyful events were given in honor of fathers,\r\n     husbands, brothers and lovers home from the war. Days and\r\n     nights were spent making flags and banners, twining arches\r\n     that were placed over the street, cooking of good things.\r\n     Nothing was too good for the soldier boys. When the tables\r\n     were spread in the grove the returned soldiers, led by\r\n     Colonel T. Z. Cook, Colonel Merritt, Colonel Coulter, and\r\n     General Jack Stibbs marched up the street. Many were scarred\r\n     and lame and with emaciated faces. The bullet-riddled flags\r\n     were carried at half mast for those who fell in the battle\r\n     or died in southern hospitals. Our tears of joy were mingled\r\n     with tears of sorrow. For a year or two afterwards all\r\n     entertainments were given to raise money for soldiers'\r\n     widows and orphans. Parties and fairs of every description\r\n     were given.\r\n\r\n     A colonial ball was given in '59, in which Colonel T. Z.\r\n     Cook and Colonel Merritt and General Jack Stibbs came in\r\n     military costume. All three were handsome men with soldierly\r\n     bearing. All who attended this ball were in colonial dress.\r\n     To me it was the most beautiful social function of those\r\n     days. There were a number of beautiful women and handsome\r\n     men who looked well in colonial style of dress.\r\n\r\n     This party was given at Carpenter's hall Tuesday evening,\r\n     March 1, 1859, and was for the benefit of the Mount Vernon\r\n     fund. The patronesses were Mesdames Wm. H. Merritt, H. G.\r\n     Angle, S. C. Koontz, Wm. Greene, J. G. Graves, W. B. Mack,\r\n     C. B. Rowley, H. W. Perkins, S. D. Carpenter.\r\n\r\n     The committee on arrangements was composed of Wm. H.\r\n     Merritt, H. G. Angle, R. R. Taylor, W. B. Mack, D. M.\r\n     McIntosh, Lawson Daniels, Edward J. Smith, Hon. Geo. Greene,\r\n     S. D. Carpenter, Wm. Greene, John G. Graves, T. Z. Cook, H.\r\n     B. Stibbs, T. S. McIntosh, Wm. Berkley.\r\n\r\n     In '69 and '70 there was a fine course of lectures by Bayard\r\n     Taylor, Henry Ward Beecher, Barnum, J. G. Saxe and other\r\n     noted lecturers. The money raised was used to fit up a small\r\n     public library which was in circulation for a number of\r\n     years.\r\n\r\n     Judge Greene built a fine opera house and always gave the\r\n     use of it for entertainments for charity and the ladies gave\r\n     a great many affairs. It was not unusual for them to make\r\n     one thousand dollars at one entertainment, for everything\r\n     was donated and people attended entertainments of that sort\r\n     better then than they do at the present day. Years ago towns\r\n     in the vicinity of twenty miles returned social courtesies.\r\n     In the winter of '68 Iowa City and Cedar Rapids got very\r\n     friendly. A party of young people were invited to a ball\r\n     given at the Kirkwood in Iowa City. The weather was cold,\r\n     the snow deep; but bob sleds were rigged up with buffalo\r\n     robes. This party started out early, but owing to the deep\r\n     snow and an upset or two, it was late when they arrived. But\r\n     they had a pleasant time and returned late next day.\r\n\r\n     Marion and Cedar Rapids were very cordial to each other.\r\n     When the homes of I. N. Preston, Mr. Twogood, and Preston\r\n     Daniels were opened with social events a number of Cedar\r\n     Rapids people were invited and these families gave beautiful\r\n     parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n_Southern Influence_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every frontier community we gauge the settlement by the influences\r\nwhich predominate. Thus we have the Buckeye, the Hoosier, and New\r\nEngland elements in certain states and communities, making these local\r\ninfluences more or less marked traits of character, according to the\r\nsize of the settlements, and also the temperaments of the settlers. In\r\nan early day there arrived in Linn county a number of people from South\r\nCarolina, who located here and influenced the social side of this\r\nfrontier settlement in a marked degree. These families settled here in\r\n1849: The Legare, Bryan, McIntosh, Stoney, and other families. The\r\nLegare family came from John's Island, about ten miles from Charleston,\r\nwhere they had lived for several centuries, being of an old French\r\nHuguenot family, which had removed to England and from there emigrated\r\nto America. It was here, or rather in Charleston, that Hugh Swinton\r\nLegare was born in 1789, the mother being of Scotch descent and related\r\nto Sir Walter Scott. Hugh Legare first obtained a private education\r\nfrom a Catholic priest, later graduating from the University of South\r\nCarolina. He embarked in 1818 for France, later taking up studies in\r\nEdinburgh and on the continent. After a stay of two years he returned\r\nto America to take charge of his mother's plantation. Not until 1822\r\ndid he begin the practice of law in Charleston; he also edited the\r\n_Southern Review_, and in this journal advocated views opposed to\r\nnullification. His attitude on this question brought him into\r\nprominence, and he was elected attorney general of the state. While in\r\nWashington he met Livingstone, then secretary of state, who offered him\r\na position as minister to Belgium, which he accepted. After his return\r\nto America he was elected to congress in 1836, but was defeated for\r\nre-election in 1840 on account of his opposition to the sub-treasury\r\nbill. He was rewarded by President Tyler with a place in the cabinet as\r\nattorney general, and for a time acted as secretary of state. He died\r\nin 1843, one of the best known public men of his time.\r\n\r\nHis sister, Margaret Swinton Legare, who had been her brother's\r\ntravelling companion and most intimate friend, in 1849 brought a\r\nfortune to Cedar Rapids. She was accompanied by her nephews, B. S.\r\nBryan, Hugh L. Bryan, and Michael Bryan. It is said that nearly $80,000\r\nin cash were at one time invested in property in this county by this\r\nfamily alone. A large part of this amount was invested in lands and in\r\na woolen mill, which was located near what is now known as the Cooper\r\nmills.\r\n\r\nMichael Bryan was married to a Miss Dwight, a distant relative of\r\nGeneral Marion. She was also wealthy in her own name. A bank was\r\nstarted by the Bryans and the Wards in the early fifties known as Ward,\r\nBryan & Co.'s Bank. This bank failed in the panic of 1857, Colonel I.\r\nM. Preston becoming receiver.\r\n\r\nDonald M. McIntosh, Mrs. Rutledge, and her sisters, Joanna and Harley,\r\ncame about the same time and were related to the other families. Many\r\nother less prominent southern people during these years came to Cedar\r\nRapids which could boast of a true southern society. Mr. McIntosh\r\nerected one of the first brick dwellings in the city and held various\r\npublic offices. Michael Bryan was alderman in 1851, while B. S. Bryan\r\nwas elected city recorder. The Bryans were not outspoken in politics,\r\nbut McIntosh was a democrat, the aunt, Miss Legare, held to the whig\r\ntenets of her illustrious brother, whose speeches and works she\r\nedited. She was also interested in church work, as well as in the\r\neducation of women.\r\n\r\nMichael Bryan erected a fine residence where the old N. B. Brown\r\nhomestead is now located. At this house social affairs of the little\r\ntown were conducted in true southern style, and fortunate was the\r\nperson who was favored with an invitation to visit in the Bryan home.\r\nMichael Bryan died here, and the widow with her family returned to\r\nSouth Carolina just preceding the Civil war. B. S. Bryan removed to the\r\ncoast and is still living in Seattle.\r\n\r\nMiss Legare organized a ladies' seminary, and was an artist of\r\nconsiderable talent. She was also an accomplished musician. It is said\r\nthat she brought the first piano to the county. However, this claim has\r\nbeen disputed as it is said that the J. P. Glass family brought a\r\nmusical instrument here in 1846.\r\n\r\nIn the '50s Miss Legare became the wife of Lowell Bullen, an uncle of\r\nthe Daniels brothers, whose home was in North Brookfield,\r\nMassachusetts. They resided at Marion until Mr. Bullen's death in 1869,\r\nwhen the widow returned to her old home in South Carolina, surviving\r\nher husband a number of years.\r\n\r\nNearly all the members of the southern society were members of the\r\nPresbyterian church, and took an active part in the religious and\r\nsocial work of that people. Mrs. Bullen was kind and considerate. Her\r\ndignified presence was enough to give her entrance into any home. She\r\ntook an active interest in the poor, and was interested in education in\r\ngeneral. She loved and revered the memory of her statesman brother, and\r\nnever forgot what place he held at one time in the affairs of the\r\nnation. During the rebellion she felt that her heart would break as she\r\nthought of friends and relatives fighting on both sides in that\r\nterrible struggle for the preservation of the Union.\r\n\r\nA letter received lately from Bryan & Bryan, attorneys of Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, throws some light on this subject:\r\n\r\n     \"In reply to your letter of the 10th instant, we beg to say\r\n     that H. S. and B. S. (Benjamin Simons) and Michael Bryan, of\r\n     whom you speak, were the sons of Col. John Bryan, a planter\r\n     of this section.\r\n\r\n     \"He (Col. John Bryan) married a sister of Hugh Legare, the\r\n     writer and statesman, and attorney general of the United\r\n     States. These sons went to Cedar Rapids before 1860.\r\n\r\n     \"Michael Bryan married Harriet Dwight, a sister of my\r\n     mother, Rebecca Dwight.\r\n\r\n     \"It happened strangely enough, that my father, George S.\r\n     Bryan, who married Rebecca Dwight, was no relation to\r\n     Michael Bryan, who married Harriet Dwight. (In other words,\r\n     the two Bryans being no relation, married two sisters.)\r\n\r\n     \"Michael Bryan had several children, the survivors are Emily\r\n     Bryan, married ---- Andrews, now living in Abbeville county,\r\n     South Carolina, with a number of children, her husband being\r\n     a planter; and William Bryan, whose residence is unknown to\r\n     the writer.\r\n\r\n     \"Michael Bryan's nephew, Edward Bryan, is also living on one\r\n     of our Sea Islands, in the vicinity of Charleston, and is a\r\n     planter. As far as we can ascertain, B. S. Bryan of whom you\r\n     speak, was engaged in banking in Cedar Rapids, and Michael\r\n     Bryan was engaged in real estate, having built up a portion\r\n     of Cedar Rapids. He died in Cedar Rapids before 1860, and\r\n     his family removed back to South Carolina. They were not\r\n     Quakers, but Presbyterians, and attended the Circular\r\n     church, Meeting street, in Charleston, S. C., which was a\r\n     branch of the Presbyterian church.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAPTIST CHURCH, PRAIRIEBURG]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILWAUKEE BRIDGE, AT COVINGTON]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above mentioned, a large number of cultured and\r\neducated people came from Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia.\r\nWho does not remember the aristocratic and learned A. Sidney Belt, the\r\nrobust, courtly old gentleman, Colonel S. W. Durham, the versatile\r\nand polite Judge Israel Mitchell, the genial Oxley brothers, and scores\r\nof other southern men and women?\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legare, Bryan, McIntosh, Durham, Oxley, Belt,\r\nMitchell, and other southern families who located in Linn county did\r\nmuch in changing the manners of this somewhat cosmopolitan community.\r\nThese families pursued education. The members had traveled much. They\r\nwere descended from some of the most cultured families in this country.\r\nThey were social, interesting, and entertained much, and it is needless\r\nto add that the citizens of the county were not slow in receiving the\r\nsouthern settlers into their homes. The presence of such an influence\r\nin the formative period of the county's history wielded an influence\r\nwhich has not been entirely effaced after a period of half a century.\r\n\r\nSome time later came the Hart brothers, Jacob A. and Caspar J., and for\r\nyears the influence of these sturdy men was a power for good in the\r\ncity and the county. It will be many years before these splendid\r\nrepresentatives of the southland will be forgotten. The home of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Jacob A. Hart was a most hospitable one. It was always open to the\r\nnew settler from the south, and especially to those who came from\r\nMaryland, their old home. Their commodious brick dwelling that stood so\r\nlong at the corner of Second street and Fifth avenue, was a center for\r\nlong years of true and genuine hospitality. Its doors were never locked\r\nagainst a Marylander, and all these felt free to \"come early and stay\r\nlate.\" To many a young son of the south Mother Hart was ever the best\r\nof mothers, caring for the sick lads, satisfying their hunger with\r\nfried chicken and Maryland biscuits--oh, who that once was welcomed\r\nthere will ever lose the memory of it! Mrs. Hart is yet a resident of\r\nthis city, spending a ripe old age in dispensing the same\r\nwell-remembered hospitality, going about doing the deeds of kindness.\r\n\r\nMrs. R. C. Rock, herself a pioneer of 1850, has vivid recollections of\r\nbeginnings in Cedar Rapids. She knew the Bryans intimately, and also\r\nthe Legares. She says they were people of culture. Mr. Stoney, the\r\nhusband of Miss Bryan, was educated abroad, and came to Cedar Rapids in\r\n1852 or 1853. These people were led to locate in the city through the\r\ninfluence of Judge Greene, whom they met in Washington. Mrs. Rock\r\nstates that at this day it is impossible to estimate what Judge Greene\r\nmeant to the young city. Through his influence people of means,\r\nculture, and learning were induced to come to the city and county. He\r\ntraveled a great deal, and something good for Cedar Rapids always\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nJ. J. Snouffer was another Marylander who came to Cedar Rapids in 1850,\r\nand for nearly a half century his was a powerful influence in the\r\ncommunity. He was prominent in business and political affairs, and was\r\never a loyal citizen.\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Taylor, one of the prominent early physicians, came from\r\nVirginia in 1851. After remaining here a few years he removed to\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n_Some Township History_\r\n\r\n\r\nBERTRAM TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nIn the history of Linn county Bertram township has played a conspicuous\r\npart, and was at various times about to be the township in which were\r\nlocated some of the most enterprising towns in the county. Ivanhoe,\r\nWestport, also known as Newark, and other places are well known names\r\namong the early settlers. Their locations have been wiped off the map,\r\nso to speak, on account of changed conditions. The following sketch is\r\ntaken largely from manuscripts and articles written by the late John J.\r\nDaniels, one of the old citizens of Linn county, one of the early\r\ncounty recorders, for many years a justice of the peace, and a well\r\nknown and enterprising citizen, who was always interested in the old\r\nsettlers and in the development of historical research in the county in\r\nearly days. Mr. Daniels says:\r\n\r\n     \"In the early settlement of Linn county the territory now\r\n     forming Bertram township was selected by the early settlers\r\n     for very prominent reasons, it having good mill streams,\r\n     good water, and plenty of good timber near at hand, which\r\n     was so much needed by the early settlers for building and\r\n     fencing. Two of the early pioneers were Thomas W. and Sarah\r\n     Campbell, of Dearborn county, Indiana. They came in the fall\r\n     of 1838 and settled on the northeast quarter of section 27,\r\n     and obtained a patent from the United States March 7, 1844.\r\n     Mr. Campbell was elected the first county treasurer in 1839,\r\n     and in 1840 his first collection of county taxes for\r\n     licenses, ferries, and lands was $985.85. He died February\r\n     22, 1876.\r\n\r\n     \"Perry and Catherine Campbell Oxley, of Montgomery county,\r\n     Indiana, first located in Linn township, but in the fall of\r\n     1838 came here and took up a claim on the southwest quarter\r\n     of section 22 and built their cabin in the grove near the\r\n     east line. Mr. Oxley was the first constable elected in the\r\n     county in 1839, and was bailiff of the grand jury of the\r\n     county. He was the best shot in the county. He died\r\n     September 30, 1886, universally mourned.\r\n\r\n     \"Norris and Ann Cone, of Connecticut, came in February,\r\n     1839, and settled on section 21. Mr. Cone later removed to\r\n     Marion. George Cone, their son, claims the honor of being\r\n     the first child born in the township in 1839.\r\n\r\n     \"James and Elizabeth Leabo and Israel Mitchell, natives of\r\n     Kentucky, in 1838 left the mining regions near Dubuque and\r\n     settled on claims in this township on the north side of the\r\n     river. Mrs. Leabo died September, 1852, and James Leabo\r\n     removed to Oregon, where he died.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Mitchell was a graduate of a Kentucky college and\r\n     celebrated the first 4th of July at Westport in 1838, Judge\r\n     Mitchell being the orator.\r\n\r\n     \"The first and only election of the county that year was\r\n     held there, thirty-two votes being cast. The first store\r\n     opened in the county was at Westport, by Albert Henry in the\r\n     fall of 1838.\r\n\r\n     \"James and Mary Scott, of Indiana, came in 1838 or 1839. Mr.\r\n     Scott was an enterprising farmer. He purchased a saw mill on\r\n     Big creek and early built a large flouring mill during the\r\n     fifties. On account of the failure of crops the mill was not\r\n     a success. He died in 1894 in Marion township.\r\n\r\n     \"Elias Doty, of Ohio, came in 1838 or '39, and in 1840\r\n     commenced the building of a saw mill on Big creek, but was\r\n     accidentally killed at its raising. The mill property later\r\n     passed into the hands of James R. Briney.\r\n\r\n     \"James Hunter, a native of Ireland, came in 1838 and took a\r\n     claim; he died May 14, 1888, at the age of sixty-nine.\r\n\r\n     \"Everett Oxley, a native of Kentucky, born in 1812, at the\r\n     age of fifteen removed to Indiana where he married Catherine\r\n     Milner, also a native of Kentucky, coming to Linn county in\r\n     1840. Mr. Oxley died in 1887. Several of the Oxley family\r\n     emigrated to Linn county.\r\n\r\n     \"Jeremiah Daniels arrived in the spring of 1844 with a stock\r\n     of dry goods, trading for wheat in the fall, shipping same\r\n     by flat-boat to St. Louis. In the fall of 1847-8 he built a\r\n     saw mill on Indian creek and a few years later located a\r\n     flour mill on Big creek. Mr. Daniels died in 1882.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Daniels further states that some of the early settlers were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     \"Michael and Peter McRoberts, Peter D. Harman, Ben and John\r\n     Dewitt, John, Joseph, and Nancy Gourly, Andrew and Thomas\r\n     Dill, Isaac, Lawrence, Elijah, and Joseph Wain, Louis\r\n     Lafore, Perry and Ann Knapp, Ada J. James, Steve, Charles,\r\n     Daniel, George, Theresa, and Ann Rose, Sylvester Lyons,\r\n     Thomas Rose, James and Thomas Piner, James M. and Susan\r\n     Doty, Abraham Darr, John Arford, Hiram and Mary Leabo-Deem,\r\n     Sam and Rachel Stambaugh, Jonathan and Dorcas Paul, John\r\n     Bromwell, Michael Cox, Louis Kramer, Dr. Grove, Dave\r\n     Stambaugh, James Briney, Leonard Speckelmeyer, James Berry,\r\n     James Anderson, Caleb Dyer, Joseph Caraway, John and Mary\r\n     Scott, and Samuel Durham.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the Bertram justices have been William S. Darr, Frank Allen, W.\r\nB. Plummer, E. Doty, J. C. Anderson.\r\n\r\nBertram township has been the location of a number of squatter towns.\r\nWilliam Stone first staked out a squatter town and called it Westport.\r\nHe sold out his right to Albert Henry and then staked out Columbus\r\nwhere Cedar Rapids is now located. Henry, it is stated, erected two of\r\nthe first frame buildings in this town, and in fact in this part of the\r\ncounty. The only sawed lumber in the entire buildings were the window\r\nframes and the casings. The siding was what was known as shaved lumber.\r\nThese buildings were torn down in 1861 by Elias and Daniel Doty. One of\r\nthese buildings was used by James Doty for his pottery shop up to the\r\ntime of his death. Perry Oxley bought Albert Henry's squatter claim and\r\nhe later sold his right, title, and interest in the town as well as in\r\nabout 117 acres of land at $2.50 an acre. Now for the first time James\r\nDoty thought he would comply with the law, and on November 12, 1844,\r\nfiled a plat in accordance with the law and called the town Newark,\r\nfrom Newark, New Jersey, his birthplace. Ivanhoe was never platted, but\r\nwas only a squatter town founded by Cowles. Colonel Merritt kept the\r\nfirst store at Ivanhoe for parties in Rock Island. This town had better\r\nprospects of becoming a great city than any other town in the county.\r\nIt had a good river frontage, a rich country around it, plenty of\r\ntimber and good water, and had the government road besides. For some\r\nunknown cause the place seems to have been ignored when Marion and\r\nCedar Rapids began to flourish. This is true, that Ivanhoe and Westport\r\nwere laid out expecting the river to be the means of communicating with\r\nthe outside world. The railroads, mills, dams and other things changed\r\nconditions, and the Indian trading villages came to naught.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIRFAX TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nFairfax township lies in the extreme southwest portion of Linn county.\r\nPrairie creek, at times an unruly stream, drains this part of the\r\ncounty. In the early day this portion of Linn county had more or less\r\ntimber, especially in what is known as Scotch Grove, northeast of the\r\ntown of Fairfax. This timber has, for the most part, been cut off.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers, as far as is known, who came to this part of the\r\ncounty were Robert and Jane Ure with their family of grown children, in\r\nthe spring of 1841. The children were John, Margaret, James, William,\r\nRobert, Walter, and David. The family had emigrated from Scotland in\r\n1838 and gone west, locating in Ohio for a short time, removing to Iowa\r\nterritory in search of land. They located in the northwestern part of\r\nthe township in the grove which has since been called \"Scotch Grove.\"\r\nThe Ures wrote back to Scotland to their friends, and for many years\r\nemigrants came who located in and around Scotch Grove in Linn and\r\nBenton counties. Later came the McDowell family, the Listebargers, the\r\nMcKinnons, the Mitchells, Giddings, Knickerbockers, Flahertys,\r\nFerriters, Henrys, Cahills, Hines, McFarlands, and many others.\r\n\r\nA cemetery was established in Scotch Grove where a number of the early\r\nsettlers are buried. The cemetery near Fairfax is now the one in use,\r\nand also the Catholic cemetery southwest of Fairfax.\r\n\r\nOne of the first school teachers in the township was Mrs. Keziah\r\nMcDowell, who taught in a private house. The first school building was\r\nerected in 1855 on the place where the Elm Grove school now stands. The\r\nfirst teacher who taught in a school building was a Mr. Eckerman, who\r\nboarded around. The families who had children attending school at that\r\ntime were the McKinnons, the Listebargers, and the Hodges.\r\n\r\nThe first reaping machine in this part of the county was purchased by\r\nWilliam Ure at Chicago in the summer of 1847, and was a hand-raking\r\nmachine. Mr. Ure drove with an ox team to Chicago and returned with a\r\nmachine in time for cutting the grain that summer. After he got started\r\nall the neighbors helped and the machine was run night and day until\r\nthe season was over and the grain harvested.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch families were United Presbyterians, and for many years\r\nattended church in Cedar Rapids. In May, 1858, the Presbyterian church\r\nwas organized and established in Scotch Grove. The fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the establishment of this church was celebrated in 1908, and the\r\npaper read by Miss Jennie G. Mitchell, daughter of James Mitchell, now\r\nresiding in Cedar Rapids, gives a full history of the church and of\r\nmany of the old settlers of this county, and is herewith inserted in\r\nfull:\r\n\r\n\"THE ORIGIN OF FAIRFAX U. P. CHURCH\r\n\r\n     \"The first settlers in this part of Linn county, Iowa, were\r\n     Robert and Jane Ure, who, with a family of grown children,\r\n     came here in the spring or summer of 1841. The children were\r\n     John, Margaret, James, William, Jane, Robert, Walter, and\r\n     David. The family had emigrated from Scotland in 1838 and\r\n     spent the intervening years near Springfield, Ohio. But land\r\n     was high in the old settlements and they came 'west' where\r\n     they could enter government land, settling, or at first\r\n     camping, on the same ground where this church is built. Log\r\n     houses were soon erected and some land entered and a few\r\n     years later a brick house was built, the first in this part\r\n     of the country. The brick was made by the boys and the\r\n     entire house erected without the assistance of any expert,\r\n     the lime being hauled all the way from Muscatine. The Ure\r\n     family did not leave their religion in the Auld Kirk in the\r\n     Homeland, but during all their travels, whether they tarried\r\n     or camped for only the night, the morning and evening\r\n     sacrifice of family prayer was offered; and on Sabbath at\r\n     noon the family were gathered and God's word read, followed\r\n     by praise and prayer. Thus they kept God's holy day and\r\n     worshiped in their own home until preaching could be\r\n     obtained, and by searching the records of the First United\r\n     Presbyterian church of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, we find that on\r\n     the 9th day of September, 1850, a meeting was held and a\r\n     petition forwarded to the Associate Presbytery of Iowa,\r\n     asking for a supply of preaching, and in 1851 the\r\n     congregation in Cedar Rapids was organized, the Ure family\r\n     uniting with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"OLD SCHOOL\" COGGON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH SIDE MAIN STREET, COGGON]\r\n\r\n     \"The cheap land and plenty of timber attracted others, and\r\n     in the early fifties the McKinnon family came from Scotland\r\n     and settled in Linn county near Scotch Grove. In 1852 Samuel\r\n     and Sarah Hall, with their large family, settled at Sisley's\r\n     Grove, and in 1854 James Cleghorn, Sr., with his two\r\n     children and John and Agnes Anderson. James Cleghorn and\r\n     Agnes Anderson were brother and sister. James Cleghorn, Jr.,\r\n     is still living near where they located and built their\r\n     first home. Robert Brownlie and family now reside where the\r\n     Anderson home was built. This same year (1854) Joseph and\r\n     Margaret Humphrey and family came and settled south of\r\n     Prairie Creek, and in the spring of 1855, James and John\r\n     Mitchell with their wives and families, and later Walter\r\n     Mitchell and John and Jane McGregor with their families of\r\n     sons and daughters, and a few years later Moses Mitchell,\r\n     all finding homes in and around Scotch Grove.\r\n\r\n     \"The Ure family, thus re-inforced, soon after began an\r\n     effort to secure preaching at Scotch Grove. But who first\r\n     proposed asking for preaching, or where the meeting was\r\n     held, is not on record and can not be recalled, but a minute\r\n     on the records of the Cedar Rapids church, dated May 25,\r\n     1856, reads thus: 'The people of Scotch Grove presented a\r\n     petition and were granted one-fourth of the pastor's time.'\r\n     But by whom this petition was presented is not recorded.\r\n     Another record reads: 'At a meeting of the United\r\n     Presbyterian church of Kingston, held on Tuesday afternoon\r\n     at four o'clock, July 6, 1858, the following paper was\r\n     adopted: Action of the United Presbyterian congregation of\r\n     Kingston in relation to the organization of a church at\r\n     Scotch Grove, Linn County, Iowa. _Resolved_: that we approve\r\n     of the organization with the understanding that they\r\n     continue in connection with us as the same pastoral charge\r\n     until otherwise ordered by the Presbytery.' But the name of\r\n     the Presbytery is not mentioned. It is supposed that Joseph\r\n     Humphrey carried the petition to Presbytery. The\r\n     organization was granted and on the 12th day of August,\r\n     1858, a meeting was held in the home of James and Mary Ure,\r\n     a sermon preached and the congregation organized by Rev.\r\n     Hugh Sturgeon. There were fifteen charter members, and the\r\n     name given the congregation was 'Fairfax.' The names of all\r\n     present can not be recalled, but we remember that John\r\n     Beatty, who later with his family came to the neighborhood,\r\n     brought Mr. Sturgeon and was present at this meeting. Three\r\n     elders were elected, Joseph Humphrey, Alexander Johnson and\r\n     James Mitchell. James Mitchell did not accept the office and\r\n     at a later meeting James Ure was elected and with the other\r\n     two, ordained and installed. Thus organized and equipped\r\n     they began the work with high hopes and willing hands, if\r\n     not much ready money. There being no public building which\r\n     could be used for religious meetings, they were held in\r\n     homes, most of the time in the home of Miss Margaret Ure.\r\n     Rev. Sturgeon did not long remain and others came. Revs.\r\n     Douthett, A. J. Allen, Sawhill, Fulton, and others. Doctor\r\n     Roberts of the Covenanter faith preached a few times. One\r\n     occasion is remembered when he was to preach in the home of\r\n     Mr. Wadsworth, where Mr. and Mrs. William Russell now live.\r\n     Heavy rains had fallen during the week and Prairie creek was\r\n     over its banks, with the bridge either washed away or\r\n     overflowed. Several families lived on the other side who\r\n     must attend the service on the Sabbath, no thought of the\r\n     high water being an excuse for staying at home. They wished\r\n     to attend and were needed to assist with the singing. The\r\n     names of three families are remembered: Dixon, Junk, and\r\n     Humphrey. Among other plans some one suggested building a\r\n     raft, whom we do not remember, but superintended by Andrew\r\n     Mitchell the work was begun, and finished Saturday\r\n     afternoon. Sabbath afternoon the families came in their\r\n     wagons as far as the creek, where they were met by neighbors\r\n     on this side, ferried across by Andrew Mitchell, and\r\n     conveyed to the home of Mr. Wadsworth. After the service\r\n     they were brought back to the place of crossing and again\r\n     ferried over, all in a quiet way becoming the day and\r\n     occasion. Thus obstacles were met and overcome with the\r\n     persistent determination of people who retained some of the\r\n     spirit of their invincible John Knox. But a school house was\r\n     erected in the early sixties, known as the James Ure school\r\n     house, and religious meetings were held here. If possible,\r\n     preaching, if not, Sabbath school and prayer meeting until\r\n     their first pastor, Rev. J. T. Torrence, came among them.\r\n\r\n     \"Shall we ask: Did the work prosper? How well, vines\r\n     transplanted from the Scotch Grove church in Nebraska,\r\n     Kansas, Colorado, Idaho and far-off California will testify.\r\n\r\n     \"Is it possible to over-estimate the courage and\r\n     perseverance of our fathers and mothers, who began the work\r\n     in this new country under the great difficulties and\r\n     privations, and whose faith, as well as strength of arm, has\r\n     made possible the privileges we, their children, enjoy? We\r\n     trust we shall not forget, but to succeeding generations\r\n     tell the heroism of the daily strife and the earnestness and\r\n     value of the twice daily prayer, 'All honor to the builders\r\n     of this Church.'\r\n\r\n         'The world may sound no trumpets--ring no bells,\r\n         The book of life the shining record tells.'\r\n\r\n     \"THE CHARTER MEMBERS\r\n\r\n     \"Fifty years is a longer time than the memory of most of\r\n     those living runs. The span of life is not always, in fact\r\n     not usually, lengthened to include events so wide apart in\r\n     space of time.\r\n\r\n     \"Fifty years ago, the great Civil war had not been fought,\r\n     and it was the hopes of those who held the welfare of their\r\n     country nearest to their hearts that such a calamity might\r\n     be averted. Fifty years ago, the memory of those two great\r\n     national characters, Webster and Clay, whose eloquence and\r\n     zeal postponed that great contest a decade, was fresh to the\r\n     little band that bound themselves together here at Scotch\r\n     Grove that they might have the privileges of a church home.\r\n\r\n     \"In May of 1858, the United Presbyterian church was formed\r\n     by the union of the Associate Presbyterians and Associate\r\n     Reform Presbyterian churches. In the fall of that same year,\r\n     fifteen devoted Christian citizens organized the new\r\n     congregation and called it the United Presbyterian Church of\r\n     Fairfax, Iowa.\r\n\r\n     \"It is interesting to note that while these fifteen early\r\n     pioneers were planning for the organization, Abraham Lincoln\r\n     was debating with Douglas the merits of the Dred Scott\r\n     decision.\r\n\r\n     \"These fifteen charter members were:\r\n\r\n          \"Samuel Hall and wife, Sarah Hall.\r\n          \"Joseph Humphrey and wife, Margaret Humphrey.\r\n          \"Alexander Johnson and wife, Janet McKinnon Johnson.\r\n          \"James Mitchell and wife, Margaret McArthur Mitchell.\r\n          \"John Mitchell and wife, Margaret Mitchell.\r\n          \"William McKinnon and wife, Janet McKinnon.\r\n          \"James Ure and wife, Mary Ure, and\r\n          \"Miss Margaret Ure.\r\n\r\n     \"Associated with these fifteen charter members in word and\r\n     work were John McGregor and wife, Jane Robertson McGregor,\r\n     who later became members of the new organization.\r\n\r\n     \"Of these persons, there are three still living--Mr. and\r\n     Mrs. James Ure, who live at Denver, Colorado, and Mr. James\r\n     Mitchell, who lives at Cedar Rapids, Iowa. [Mr. and Mrs. Ure\r\n     are now deceased, 1910].\r\n\r\n     \"James and Margaret Ure were among the very earliest\r\n     settlers in this community. They, with their parents, had\r\n     come to Iowa in 1841, five years before the territory was\r\n     admitted to statehood. Both were born in Scotland and came\r\n     to America in 1838, settling near Springfield, Ohio, where\r\n     they lived till they came west. In 1857 James Ure was\r\n     married to Mary Kerr. She was born in March, 1835, in\r\n     Mercer, Pennsylvania, where she spent her early childhood,\r\n     later removing with her parents to Dubuque, Iowa. They began\r\n     housekeeping on their farm just east of the grove, where\r\n     they lived till April, 1892, when they moved to Denver,\r\n     Colorado.\r\n\r\n     \"In September, 1879, Mr. Ure asked for his certificate of\r\n     admission, which was granted. He was one of the ruling\r\n     elders elected at the time of the organization.\r\n\r\n     \"Margaret Ure was born in Scotland in 1821. After coming to\r\n     Scotch Grove she resided on the Ure homestead, now owned by\r\n     Jas. Rogers. She was a woman of great abilities and was\r\n     always liberal in giving of her time and means to the work\r\n     of the church. The church building was not erected for some\r\n     years after the organization of the congregation and her\r\n     home was always open for the holding of services during this\r\n     time. The pulpit furniture now in use was a gift of hers.\r\n     She removed to Cedar Rapids in 1884, where she died. She was\r\n     buried in the Fairfax cemetery.\r\n\r\n     \"James Mitchell, one of the three surviving charter members,\r\n     and who now resides at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was born March 3,\r\n     1821, in Buchlyvie, Stirlingshire, Scotland. He came to\r\n     America in 1851 and settled in New York state. July 8, 1853,\r\n     he was married to Margaret McArthur and in July, 1855, came\r\n     to Linn county, Iowa. Mrs. Mitchell was born June 8, 1823,\r\n     and died June 20, 1904, at the age of 81 years and 12 days.\r\n\r\n     \"At the time Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell came west, in 1855, the\r\n     railroad ran no farther west than to Rock Island. At this\r\n     point they, in company with Margaret and William Ure, were\r\n     compelled to cross the Mississippi river on the ice. It was\r\n     here that they received their first initiation into the life\r\n     of hardship and peril that fell to the life of the early\r\n     pioneer. While crossing the river, the wheels of their dray\r\n     began to cut through the ice. There was danger of the ice\r\n     giving way and all being drowned, but by means of levers and\r\n     props they were able to reach the Iowa shore in safety.\r\n\r\n     \"When Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell reached Scotch Grove, they took\r\n     for their home a small log house some five or six rods\r\n     southwest from the present church building, and with the\r\n     munificent sum of ten dollars with which to furnish their\r\n     home, started to carve out their career in the new country.\r\n     With Mrs. Mitchell there was little thought of what her\r\n     spring hat would be like, or what she should serve when it\r\n     came her turn to give a Kensington to the ladies of the\r\n     community. It would probably be some days before any money\r\n     would find its way into the family purse, and those ten\r\n     dollars must be guarded with jealous care. True, potatoes\r\n     could be had, and Mr. Ure and his family had proven that the\r\n     potato could be used as the sole article of diet for at\r\n     least three months.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1898 they removed to Cedar Rapids, where four years ago\r\n     Mrs. Mitchell died. She was buried at Fairfax cemetery. Mr.\r\n     Mitchell is now eighty-seven years of age. He was elected to\r\n     the office of ruling elder in December, 1879, which he\r\n     filled till the time he removed to Cedar Rapids. July 8,\r\n     1903, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell celebrated their golden wedding.\r\n\r\n     \"John Mitchell came to America in 1853. Margaret McGregor\r\n     Mitchell was born in Sterlingshire, Scotland, September 8,\r\n     1831. In 1852 she came to America with her parents, settling\r\n     in New York state. The following year she was married to\r\n     Mr. John Mitchell and in 1855 came to Scotch Grove. Here\r\n     they settled in a small log house near the present church\r\n     lot. Robert Ure, father of James and Margaret Ure, had,\r\n     during the time of the gold excitement in California, built\r\n     three of these houses, the first being erected without the\r\n     use of a nail.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Mitchell entered forty acres of land west of where the\r\n     Conley school house now stands. After the school house was\r\n     built, preaching services and Sabbath school were held\r\n     there, and Mr. Mitchell was one of the most active in\r\n     lending help and maintaining the services. He died January\r\n     17, 1896, at Norway; she February 3, 1892. Both were buried\r\n     in the Fairfax cemetery.\r\n\r\n     \"Alexander Johnson was born in Pennsylvania, his father\r\n     coming to America from Ireland. On coming to Iowa he lived\r\n     at Cedar Rapids for a time, where he teamed. Here he lost\r\n     his first wife and was later married to Janet McKinnon, who\r\n     was born in Bo'ness, Scotland, and came to America in 1845.\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. Johnson owned some land at Que's Grove, now known as\r\n     Quam's Grove. This she bought from the government. Mr.\r\n     Johnson had money with which to build a house and they thus\r\n     moved on the land, where they lived till the time of his\r\n     death.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Johnson was elected to the office of ruling elder when\r\n     the congregation was organized, and was at all times an\r\n     active and persistent worker in the church. He had become\r\n     attached to his early church home and was reluctant to\r\n     leave. It may seem strange, but yet it is true, that the\r\n     place where a person spends the best years of his life,\r\n     where he has toiled and labored to make a home, becomes in\r\n     old age, after he is compelled to lay down his labors, the\r\n     spot that is dearest to him. He had seen the community grow\r\n     and develop, and as it had grown, his hopes had opened.\r\n\r\n     \"Some time prior to his death, the members of his family\r\n     wanted to remove to Washington, Iowa. He could not entertain\r\n     the thought of leaving his old home community, whose growth\r\n     and development had meant so much to him, and in a\r\n     conversation with a member of the congregation remarked that\r\n     he had said, 'If they take me away from here, it will be in\r\n     my coffin, but now I have given my consent to go.'\r\n\r\n     \"He was not permitted to make the change. During the latter\r\n     part of his life he was confined to his bed. He died at\r\n     Norway, having reached the age of eighty-four years.

He had a high sense of\r\n     the responsibility of his office, viewing it as one of\r\n     divine authority. It was his study, as a steward of God, to\r\n     fulfill its duties and maintain its authority. He was\r\n     punctual and regular in attendance at all the meetings of\r\n     the congregation and gave largely of his means and time in\r\n     forwarding its interests. He believed that the minister was\r\n     worthy of his hire, and rather than neglect this duty he\r\n     would let his boys go barefooted to church. He died December\r\n     5, 1871, at the age of fifty-six years.

Mr. McGregor was active in the work of the church and\r\n     especially in the raising of funds for the new church\r\n     building. Both were loyal supporters of the church, and were\r\n     among those who kept their membership in the congregation\r\n     till the time of their death.\r\n\r\n     \"The same vessel that brought them to America brought Mr.\r\n     Jas.

August 13, 1880, Mrs. McGregor died, being\r\n     just seventy-four years old. Both were buried in the Fairfax\r\n     cemetery.\r\n\r\n     \"Conditions then and now are quite different. Railroads were\r\n     not yet built into the community. At one time the produce\r\n     had to be hauled to Davenport and Muscatine. It took a week\r\n     to make the trip and when one got back home, little was left\r\n     to encourage another trip. There were no roads in many\r\n     places, and the oxen, which were often used in those days,\r\n     frequently left the wagon stuck in some slough. Before\r\n     railroads were built into Cedar Rapids, a steamboat came up\r\n     the river from the Mississippi, bringing groceries and\r\n     dry-goods and carrying the produce back. No money could be\r\n     had for the grain and stock. One must take in exchange for\r\n     them groceries and dry-goods. The panic of 1857 had not yet\r\n     spent its force. Such were the conditions surrounding the\r\n     early pioneers when the congregation was organized.\r\n\r\n     \"These members were not only pioneers in carving out homes\r\n     in a new country, but they were pioneers of the faith.\r\n     Religious services, Sabbath school and prayer meetings were\r\n     held at Conley school house, at Norway, and at Livermore\r\n     school house, besides those held at the church. They\r\n     cherished the hope and faith in the divine which they had\r\n     brought with them to the new country, and were persistent in\r\n     offering to all who might come, the advantages of the\r\n     sanctuary.\r\n\r\n     \"The early pioneers are always men of firm faith, sturdy and\r\n     strong in their beliefs, set in their opinions. It is not to\r\n     be wondered at, that when the question of where to erect the\r\n     new church building arose, there were differences of\r\n     opinion. Some wanted it located at Brownlie's corner, some\r\n     at Conley's school house and some just west of the present\r\n     site. It was at such times that William Ure stepped into the\r\n     threatened breach and by his calm counsel brought unity to\r\n     the opposing opinions. Although not a member of the Fairfax\r\n     congregation Mr. Ure rendered services as valuable as any of\r\n     its members in giving financial aid and in other ways.\r\n\r\n     \"Of these fifteen charter members, Mr. and Mrs. James\r\n     Mitchell, James and Margaret Ure, William McKinnon and John\r\n     Mitchell were all born and lived during their childhood in\r\n     the same community in Scotland. They were all baptized by\r\n     the Rev. Mr. Russell, and they attended the same church and\r\n     school. In coming west to the new country they chose out a\r\n     beautiful spot, fertile and productive. During the fifty\r\n     years, within the memory of one of the charter members, land\r\n     that was bought from the government for $1.25 per acre has\r\n     been sold for $150 per acre.\r\n\r\n     \"Four of these couples, Mr. and Mrs. Jas. Mitchell, Mr. and\r\n     Mrs. Samuel Hall, Mr. and Mrs. Jas. Ure, and Mr. and Mrs.\r\n     John McGregor, have celebrated their golden weddings. Of\r\n     these early pioneers of Scotch Grove, one has passed the age\r\n     of ninety years, six have passed the age of eighty years,\r\n     and but two died before reaching the age of seventy, a\r\n     beautiful commentary upon their rugged and sturdy character\r\n     and habits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBOULDER TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nBoulder township is located in the northern part of the county and\r\ndespite its name is one of the most fertile and productive portions of\r\nthe county. The surface is generally rolling, dotted in an early day\r\nwith excellent groves of native timber. Buffalo creek in the days\r\nbefore windmills were in common use was a much prized stream which was\r\nused by farmers near and far, for the use of their stock. William\r\nWagner is supposed to have made the first settlement in 1850. He was\r\nshortly followed by William McQueen and Silas Edington. Later came the\r\nfollowing named persons: John Wagner, Will Ward, H. B. Brown, Frank\r\nCooly, J. Wilds, J. Barnhardt and Ben Harrison. In the early fifties\r\ncame an itinerant Methodist minister, John Bell, and organized a small\r\ncongregation, services being held in a school house near the present\r\nsite of Prairieburg. The John McQueen grist mill which began operation\r\nabout 1854 on Buffalo creek, a mile southwest of Prairieburg, was a\r\nnoted mill in its day and was largely patronized by the early settlers.\r\nThe town of Prairieburg was named by Henry Ward, the first postmaster.\r\nThe first house was a log structure built by Joe Barnhardt in 1853. N.\r\nParsons erected the second house and Henry Wayne the third, which was a\r\nstore building where he opened a store. In 1856, Will Wagner started a\r\nshoe shop, and other buildings, such as hotels and blacksmith shops\r\ncame later. The recent advent of the railroad has boomed the town and\r\nthe price of land has increased greatly. A number of the early settlers\r\nand their descendants are still land owners in this township,\r\nCoquillette, Whitney, Paul, O'Rourke, Carpenter, Walker, McQueen,\r\nBurke, Rundle, Pillard, Nelson, Lacy, Leonard, Le Clerc, Smith,\r\nCushman, Hill, Soesbe, Garvis, Drexler, Tear, Considine, Matsel, and\r\nother well known families.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nClinton township, with a population of 1,000 people, located in the\r\nwestern tier of townships, has a rich, productive soil and has been\r\nfarmed continuously for sixty years and the soil shows no sign of\r\ndeterioration. The farmers residing in Clinton township have well\r\nimproved farms, good roads and a number of fine school houses and\r\nchurches. For many years the road known as the Toledo road, as well as\r\nthe Marengo road, were the two chief thoroughfares for travelers, gold\r\nseekers, and others, and consequently it was early well advertised.\r\n\r\nAmong some of the early settlers in this township may be mentioned John\r\nConley, Hiram Usher, Joe Brown, Dyer Usher, George Buchanan, Reese and\r\nthe Langhams, and scores of others who came here in the '40s.\r\n\r\nJames Yuill, Henry Maurer, John Fox, Whiteneck, Sisley, Kuhn, Wieneke,\r\nLederman, O'Connell, the Miller family, Misners, Scotts, Swetts, Hall,\r\nSnell, and many others of the early settlers came here in an early day,\r\nbuilding up the community. They have long since passed away leaving\r\ntheir children and grandchildren large tracts of productive land.\r\n\r\nSisley Grove was at a very early time a place where all the settlers,\r\nas well as travellers, congregated. The grove at that time was much\r\nlarger than it is at present, and many of the farmers adjoining owned\r\nsmall tracts of land in this grove where they cut rails and fence posts\r\nfor their farms during the winter.\r\n\r\nHere is also located a cemetery where many of the old settlers are\r\nburied, and at an early day a church was built at which the early\r\npioneers congregated once a week to hear the word of God preached. In\r\nthe absence of any regular preacher frequently the pioneer farmers\r\npreached to the congregations. This church was abandoned some years ago\r\nand the congregation has since worshiped at Fairview, a few miles\r\nfurther east.\r\n\r\nHere, also, was located Kuhn's blacksmith shop and hotel. Kuhn was a\r\nqueer old fellow, who not only was an expert blacksmith but the only\r\none for miles who was competent to shoe oxen, and consequently during\r\nthe winter months he was a very busy man. Kuhn not only was a good\r\nhorseshoer and blacksmith, but he was a dentist as well and pulled\r\nteeth when blacksmithing was slack. At one time he pulled a tooth for\r\nan old settler with an instrument used in those days and as it was\r\npretty severe he gave a drink of whiskey to stop the pain. After the\r\nfellow fully recovered his senses the tooth ached as before and the\r\npatient learned that the dentist had pulled the wrong tooth and so\r\ninformed the blacksmith, to which the blacksmith replied, \"That will be\r\neasy to remedy, just take another drink and we will go at it again, and\r\nyou will not be out very much as my charges are only ten cents a\r\ntooth.\" Old Mr. Kuhn seemed to know the wants of the community, for he\r\nkept a barrel of whiskey in his blacksmith shop and sold the stuff at\r\nthirty cents a gallon, and served free drinks to anyone on paying his\r\nbill. The hotel was not a modern kind of a house, but was generally\r\nfull, as travellers in those days were plentiful. The old man also sold\r\nfeed to travellers and consequently he generally got a little something\r\nout of every traveller who passed by Sisley Grove.\r\n\r\nThe grove was named in honor of the first settler who owned most of the\r\nland, on which the grove is situated. During the early '50s and '60s\r\nClinton township produced more wheat, it is said, than any other\r\ntownship in the county, all of which was hauled to Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFALO TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nBuffalo township was first settled by George C. Perkins, who came here\r\nin 1839 and made a claim which he occupied thereafter during his\r\nlifetime. In the early days it was well wooded and consequently much of\r\nthis land was sold in small strips to adjoining farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANT TOWNSHIP AND WALKER\r\n\r\nFor the following interesting sketch of the early settlement of\r\nnorthwestern Linn county we are under obligations to Justin Barry,\r\neditor of the Walker _News_.\r\n\r\nGrant township, forming the northwest corner of Linn county, was\r\norganized in 1872 as the result of a struggle over the levying of a tax\r\nin aid of the construction of a railroad. The B., C. R. & N., since\r\nincorporated into the Rock Island system, had projected a line from\r\nCedar Rapids north toward the Minnesota line. Washington township, then\r\nembracing much more territory than at present, had voted a five per\r\ncent tax in aid of the road. Those living in the northern portion of\r\nthe township rebelled, and in an effort to escape the tax petitioned\r\nfor a division of the territory and the formation of a new township.\r\nThey succeeded in the latter effort and the new township was designated\r\nGrant, in honor of General Grant, who was then president. However, the\r\npeople did not escape the tax, and some of those who most vigorously\r\nopposed it later embarked in business in the new town of Walker, which\r\nsprung up with the coming of the railroad, and thus their defeat became\r\nin fact the foundation for modest fortunes, which came from the large\r\nterritory and the equally large profits of pioneer business days.\r\n\r\nAs the earlier settlers sought out the timbered sections regardless of\r\nthe quality of the land, what is now Grant township, comprised as it is\r\nalmost wholly of prairie, was one of the last portions of the county to\r\nbe developed. Some few settlers came early, but progress generally was\r\nslow. A family named Norris was the first to settle within its\r\nterritory, being already located along what is now its southern border\r\nwhen John K. Speake and family came in 1840. The Norrises have since\r\ndisappeared and no one seems to know whither they went. James Buforde\r\nSpeake is now the oldest living settler in the township, and though\r\npast eighty years of age he continues to operate the farm in section 19\r\non which his father filed when the family arrived here from Illinois in\r\n1840.\r\n\r\nOther settlers came at long intervals, but for many years after the\r\narrival of the first it was predicted with great assurance that the\r\nnorthern portion of the township never would be settled but would\r\nalways remain a wilderness. And yet this valley, including the present\r\ntown site of Walker, lying north of what in the early days was called\r\nWright's Grove, now Fox's Grove, must have presented an attractive\r\npicture and one of rare beauty in its wild state, viewed from the\r\nsurrounding hills, a little creek winding its way through the center,\r\nflanked all about by great rolling ridges and fringed on either bank\r\nwith willows, with here and there a giant oak towering above all else.\r\n\r\nWilliam Davis settled in the southwest portion of the township in 1841,\r\nand on his farm in about 1850 or a little earlier was laid out the\r\nfirst cemetery in the township. It is still in use for that purpose and\r\nmany of the monuments erected in the early days bear quaint\r\ninscriptions. Mr. Davis died in 1866, leaving a large estate to his\r\nsons, Hezekiah and Edward, who carried on extensive farm operations.\r\nThe former kept a pack of hounds and for many years scoured the country\r\nfor miles around in search of wolves. The Davises later met with\r\nreverses and left the county years ago shorn of a large share of the\r\nprincely estate, which once had embraced many hundreds of acres of land\r\nin Benton and Linn counties.\r\n\r\nE. D. Hazeltine, who died only a few weeks ago at his home in Center\r\nPoint, was another early settler in the southern portion of the\r\ntownship, and he was long active in all its interests. He served for\r\nsome time in the early days as a county commissioner. During the '50s\r\nnumerous pioneer families arrived, including those of Thomas Fee, W. C.\r\nRing, C. G. and Benjamin Gitchell, W. S. Bliss, Chorydon Gilchrist,\r\nChristian Iehl, and others.\r\n\r\nFollowing the close of the Civil war development was more rapid, a\r\nnumber of soldiers fresh from the service joining the pioneers in their\r\nwork of subduing the wilderness. In 1873 when the railroad arrived\r\nsettlement had reached the northern border of the township, where James\r\nA. North, Walker Purviance, William Moses and others were located. The\r\nbuilding of the railroad brought the establishment of a new town on\r\nsection 4, which was called Walker, in honor of W. W. Walker, then\r\nchief engineer and afterward superintendent and receiver of the road.\r\n\r\nJames K. Hotchkin built the first business building, opening a general\r\nstore, and he was also appointed as the first postmaster. The second\r\nbusiness building was erected by Theo. Hamblin, present mayor of the\r\ntown, who engaged in the grocery business. O. C. Barnes built a hotel\r\non the site now occupied by the Walker _News_ office, and Fred Hoffman\r\nerected the store building now occupied by S. Liddle. The first\r\nresidence was built by C. G. Gitchell, who leased his farm in section\r\n21 and engaged in the lumber and grain business in partnership with\r\nFred Hoffman, and Mrs. Gitchell was the first woman resident of the\r\ntown. Messrs. Gitchell and Hoffman prospered greatly in business,\r\namassing modest fortunes, and both remained for many years among the\r\nleaders in business affairs. Mr. Gitchell later represented his county\r\nfor two terms in the lower house of the General Assembly of Iowa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUAKER OATS PLANT, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET RAILWAY STATION AT BEVER PARK, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\nThe town grew steadily and at once became an important market point,\r\ntapping a wide territory of rich farming country, and for many years it\r\nhas been recognized as the best shipping point on the Decorah division\r\nof the Rock Island, barring only one or two of the larger cities. The\r\nfarmers soon turned their attention largely to dairying, and in the\r\ntown now is one of the finest creamery plants in the state, \"Walker\"\r\nbutter having gained a wide fame in the city markets.\r\n\r\nMunicipal affairs have been wisely and economically administered ever\r\nsince the incorporation of the town in 1891, when the following were\r\nchosen as the first officers: Mayor, W. A. Jones; councilmen, C. G.\r\nGitchell, J. P. Bross, H. J. Nietert, J. N. Keys, Theo. Hamblin and P.\r\nL. Hutchins; recorder, O. C. Swartz; treasurer, M. B. Dodge; assessor,\r\nE. R. Wheeler; marshal, J. M. Peyton. Walker now has a pretty park\r\nembracing about two blocks of ground, a complete municipal water-works\r\nsystem affording fire protection to all portions of the town, and a\r\nwell equipped fire department. The water-works system has just been\r\nre-enforced by the sinking of a second deep well, affording an\r\ninexhaustible supply of water, and the installation of a second pumping\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nThe town's graded school system has reached a high standard of\r\nefficiency, and its graduates rank well as teachers and as students in\r\nhigher institutions. The school has four departments, all of them\r\ncrowded to their full capacity, the enrollment including many tuition\r\nscholars. Several thousand dollars have already been set aside as the\r\nfoundation of a fund for the erection of a new brick school building,\r\nwhich will be a necessity within a few years.\r\n\r\nThe town is well supplied with churches, having four protestant and one\r\nCatholic society. In the order of their organization they are:\r\nMethodist Episcopal, Free Methodist, Catholic, Presbyterian, Christian.\r\nThe first church organized in the town was in 1874 by the Wesleyan\r\nMethodist, but that denomination has since passed from the field.\r\n\r\nThat the town and surrounding country are prosperous and rapidly\r\ngrowing in wealth is shown by the fact that Walker now boasts of two\r\nstrong banks having resources reaching a half a million dollars, and\r\nwith deposits steadily increasing. Its business men are enterprising\r\nand progressive.\r\n\r\nRegularly laid out, its streets lined with shade trees, bordering\r\npermanent walks and well kept lawns, the town presents a pretty\r\nappearance, and town officials and citizens seem to vie with each other\r\nin their efforts to maintain its reputation as being one of the\r\nprettiest towns in the county.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a loyal citizen of the county for the following\r\nhistorical sketch of one of the finest districts in the county--Maine\r\ntownship. Dr. Ward Woodbridge has treated sympathetically the early\r\ndays in and around Central City. He long has lived there, has been a\r\npotent factor in the development of his community, and knows whereof he\r\nspeaks.\r\n\r\n     Maine township geographically is located in the northeast\r\n     corner of Linn county, being in the second row of townships\r\n     from both the north and east.\r\n\r\n     Its shape is an irregular triangle, containing forty-seven\r\n     square miles, making it one-third larger than the average\r\n     township. This is due to an early arrangement whereby a\r\n     portion of Buffalo township became a part of Maine. The\r\n     Wapsie river divides Buffalo township nearly in the middle.\r\n     In its early history the larger number of people resided\r\n     south of the river, as there were no bridges in those days,\r\n     and the river held a high stage of water, making it\r\n     difficult to cross. These people finally asked to be\r\n     attached to Maine township for administrative purposes, and\r\n     all that portion of Buffalo on the south side of the river\r\n     was made a part of Maine, and has never been restored.\r\n\r\n     The Wapsie river runs along the northeastern border of\r\n     Maine, and is the dividing line between it and Buffalo.\r\n\r\n     Along the river, and from one to three miles in width on\r\n     either side, the land is somewhat hilly, sandy, and has been\r\n     heavily timbered. When the more level country is reached it\r\n     becomes a gently undulating plain, rich black loam and very\r\n     productive.\r\n\r\n     As we turn in retrospect, seeing its growth and development,\r\n     we can see the work of the hardy and determined pioneers on\r\n     every hand. It was they who blazed the way. It was they who\r\n     built this Appian way of progress. It was their devotion and\r\n     privation, patiently endured, that have caused not two, but\r\n     myriads of blades of grass to grow where hitherto the one\r\n     blade was trampled under foot by the roving Indian and\r\n     buffalo, and although their forms have vanished and their\r\n     voices are stilled, and the hands roughened by honest toil\r\n     lie quiet, yet their work lives after them. They left that\r\n     imprint on both descendants and administration which makes\r\n     of the Maine township citizenship today a sturdy,\r\n     hard-headed class, whose public opinion always crystallizes\r\n     on the side of righteousness, of truth and justice. Its\r\n     people never have to apologize for their course.\r\n\r\n     Probably the first white settler was John Jenkins, who came\r\n     in 1838 and settled on the farm adjoining Central City known\r\n     as the Ormus Clark farm. In 1839 Joseph Clark bought the\r\n     farm of Jenkins, he being a son-in-law of Clark. It lies to\r\n     the southwest of Central City, and a portion of it lies\r\n     within the corporation. It is now owned by C. C. Crane.\r\n\r\n     In the winters of 1838-1840 a few trappers wintered along\r\n     the banks of the Wapsie, but the names of no permanent\r\n     settlers are recorded.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1840 two young men, natives of Maine,\r\n     landed in Maine township. They had left their state two\r\n     years before and stopped at Peoria, Illinois, working there\r\n     through the summer, and going south in the winter where they\r\n     worked in the cotton yards of New Orleans. Returning from\r\n     New Orleans in the spring of 1840 they bought three yoke of\r\n     cattle, a big prairie plow, and what other necessaries they\r\n     needed, and headed for the Mississippi river. Crossing it\r\n     they drove on and on until arriving one evening at the place\r\n     known as \"Jordan's Grove\" they camped for the night. The\r\n     next morning they cooked breakfast, and while one of them\r\n     went out to gather up the cattle, the other took his\r\n     bearings, and when the cattle were brought up he had the\r\n     plow out of the wagon. On inquiry from his partner as to\r\n     what he was about he said, \"This looks good to me. Hitch\r\n     onto the plow.\" These two young men were L. D. Jordan and Ed\r\n     McKinney. They broke enough to hold their claims, went to\r\n     Dubuque and filed on them, returned, built cabins, went back\r\n     to Maine and married sisters, returned and made homes, and\r\n     Mr. Jordan lived his whole life on the spot where he\r\n     unloaded the plow, dying there in 1890. McKinney moved from\r\n     the neighborhood some years before his death. They both\r\n     lived to be old men.\r\n\r\n     In 1840 the Heaton family came, and P. A. and Will Heaton\r\n     still live in Central City, together with two or three of\r\n     the women of the family.\r\n\r\n     In October, 1844, Chandler Jordan arrived at his brother's\r\n     place. He remained all night, and in the morning got on a\r\n     horse and rode north through the grove to the brow of the\r\n     hill overlooking the Wapsie valley.\r\n\r\n     It was beautiful Indian summer. All was purple, yellow, and\r\n     gold, and the blue-joint grass stood as high as the back of\r\n     his horse all the way down the valley. He gazed fascinated,\r\n     rode slowly down the valley of a small creek that meandered\r\n     from its source in the grove, to the river. In a level place\r\n     on the bank of the creek he stopped, staked out a claim,\r\n     returned, went to Dubuque and filed on it, came back and\r\n     began improvements.\r\n\r\n     He broke the ground and raised crops, and in the spring of\r\n     1847 built a cabin on the spot where he first dismounted,\r\n     and married Sarah D. Waterhouse in June. They went at once\r\n     to the cabin and began housekeeping. Later they built more\r\n     commodious quarters, and in 1860 erected the brick house in\r\n     which they both died in 1909.\r\n\r\n     Harvey Powell came in 1844 also, and entered a fine tract of\r\n     land on the ridge west of Central City, where he lived to a\r\n     good old age.\r\n\r\n     In 1846 N. C. Gillilan came; Jennings Crawford in 1854, and\r\n     the Haas family in the early fifties.\r\n\r\n     About this time settlers began coming in so rapidly that\r\n     honorable mention can not be made of all of them, even if\r\n     they could be traced. It can readily be seen that the\r\n     earliest settlers coming from the state of Maine gave the\r\n     name to the township. They were a sturdy lot of pioneers,\r\n     determined to win success from their surroundings. They knew\r\n     no such word as fail or can't. They knew no surcease from\r\n     labor, but toiled on without murmur or complaint.\r\n\r\n     Markets were a long way off, Dubuque and Muscatine being the\r\n     principal places where they sold their produce. It took four\r\n     days to take a load to Dubuque and bring one back. They\r\n     never made the trip with empty wagons. There were no\r\n     bridges. The roads ran across the virgin prairie, and often,\r\n     when sloughs were bad, they had to take off part of the\r\n     load, drive through a bad place, unload what they had hauled\r\n     over and return for the rest, thus delaying their journey.\r\n\r\n     Finally the Northwestern road came to Cedar Rapids in 1859,\r\n     and later a road to Marion and Springville, bringing, as\r\n     they felt, markets to their very doors.\r\n\r\n     They turned the virgin soil, sowed, reaped, mowed, and\r\n     garnered the fruits of their labor year after year, early\r\n     and late alike, working with the primitive tools of that day\r\n     when most of the work was done by main strength instead of\r\n     machinery. They formed from necessity those habits of saving\r\n     every thing which, with many, later resulted in an abundance\r\n     for the rainy day. These early privations, sturdy devotion\r\n     to the work, with a fidelity well worth emulation has\r\n     brought its rewards in one of the richest agricultural\r\n     regions on earth.\r\n\r\n     They saw the steady advancement of material things as a\r\n     reward for their patient toil. They established schools and\r\n     churches, overcoming as rapidly as possible the drawbacks\r\n     and inconveniences of pioneer life.\r\n\r\n     They made the way of the transgressor a hard one, and when\r\n     law breakers and horse thieves escaped through some sharp\r\n     practice, they took the law in their own hands and rid the\r\n     country for all time of the horse thief and general law\r\n     breaker, thereby putting a premium on honesty.\r\n\r\n     The villages of Waubeek and Central City were established in\r\n     the usual way. Blacksmith shops, stores, and post offices\r\n     being a necessity, they were established on the banks of the\r\n     Wapsie river, Central City on the north side of the river\r\n     just at the north line of the township, and Waubeek five\r\n     miles southeast on the south bank of the river.\r\n\r\n     Some dams were built across the river at both places and saw\r\n     mills established to saw lumber for the pioneer houses to\r\n     displace the log cabin. These were followed by grist mills\r\n     to make flour for the settlers, and for many years the mills\r\n     at both places were run at their full capacity. Gradually\r\n     wheat was abandoned as a product, and the people were able\r\n     to buy a better grade of flour than the home mills could\r\n     make. They were allowed to run down and were neglected until\r\n     finally the mill at Waubeek was allowed to fall in the\r\n     river. The last vestige of its site is gone.\r\n\r\n     The mill at Central City has run until lately, grinding the\r\n     feed for the farmers, but it, too, has quit, the wheel is\r\n     still, and the busy scenes about its doors are but memories\r\n     of its great convenience and usefulness to those it served\r\n     so well.\r\n\r\n     After years of quiet and peaceful pursuits the mutterings of\r\n     civil war began to be heard. The lowering clouds portending\r\n     the storm made the heart of many a pioneer mother beat with\r\n     anxiety as she felt that if it came she must lay a son on\r\n     the altar.\r\n\r\n     Finally when the storm burst on the community Maine township\r\n     was not backward in sending its quota of men, something like\r\n     twenty of its best sons enlisting in the Twentieth Iowa, and\r\n     others in the Sixteenth, the Twenty-fourth, and other\r\n     scattered regiments.\r\n\r\n     With improved market facilities and the high prices of war\r\n     times the farmers rapidly accumulated a competence.\r\n\r\n     The war over, the soldiers returned to peaceful pursuits,\r\n     the young men of other states began to hunt up locations,\r\n     and many of them found their way to Maine township.\r\n\r\n     Farms were rapidly opened up after 1865, and it was not many\r\n     years until all the open prairie was turned, fenced, put to\r\n     crops, homes built, and the whole face of the township\r\n     changed to a busy, peaceful, and prosperous scene.\r\n\r\n     In its early days there was little chance or opportunity for\r\n     religious gatherings. It was difficult to find ministers to\r\n     conduct funerals, and church services were a long way apart,\r\n     both in meeting places and appointment.\r\n\r\n     In 1854 a Methodist class was established at Central City,\r\n     then called Clarksford. In 1856 the Jordan's Grove Baptist\r\n     church was organized, and in 1858 the Congregational church\r\n     at Central City was established.\r\n\r\n     In 1855 the village of Waubeek was laid out, and for many\r\n     years was a fine trading point. Its stores, together with\r\n     its mill, did a fine business. It has one of the finest\r\n     store buildings in Linn county.\r\n\r\n     In 1856 the village of Central City was surveyed, and the\r\n     same year the dam was built across the river where it now\r\n     stands.\r\n\r\n     In 1887 the Illinois Central railroad built a line from\r\n     Manchester to Cedar Rapids, running it through Central City.\r\n     This little city, exactly half way between Manchester and\r\n     Cedar Rapids, at once began to grow as soon as it was\r\n     certain the railroad would be built.\r\n\r\n     This road was a great boon to the north part of Linn county,\r\n     as before that Marion was its nearest market, and many had\r\n     to haul their produce twenty miles to reach it.\r\n\r\n     Central City now has six hundred people. It has fourteen\r\n     business houses, three churches, a solid bank, a fine school\r\n     doing full twelve-grade work.\r\n\r\n     The post office is third class, with four rural routes. It\r\n     is the distributing point for freight for all the\r\n     surrounding country, with large hog, cattle, hay, and grain\r\n     buying facilities. It has two lumber yards, and from 1,200\r\n     to 2,000 tons of coal are shipped in here every year.\r\n\r\n     The village of Waubeek has no railroad and has made no\r\n     advance for the past twenty years. It has four stores, post\r\n     office, creamery, two churches, good schools, and fine stone\r\n     quarries.\r\n\r\n     It is not necessary to enlarge on this history. It is\r\n     doubtless a repetition of the history of many other\r\n     townships, but we, its citizens, have a local pride in its\r\n     beauty, its bounty, its prosperity, its boundless\r\n     hospitality. No finer cattle, hogs, horses, sheep, and\r\n     poultry can be found on the face of the earth than are\r\n     raised in Maine township. The physical, moral, social,\r\n     intellectual, and financial condition of the people is on a\r\n     high plane, and shows a steady growth and development\r\n     through all the years since the first settlement. Its people\r\n     have laid aside the miserly habits made necessary by their\r\n     early struggles, and there is literally nothing too good for\r\n     them to have and enjoy. This prosperity is shown by the fine\r\n     modern homes being built, or remodeled from the older ones,\r\n     all over the township, with every modern convenience in the\r\n     way of plumbing and heating, and furnished in the latest and\r\n     best way. Commodious barns and outbuildings, tiling of wet\r\n     places, and building of woven wire fences mark the advances\r\n     of farm work, making every acre available for cultivation.\r\n\r\n     The bounteous crops, the high prices of all farm produce,\r\n     the solid improvements being made, the phenomenal price of\r\n     land--and it is still soaring--all mark a prosperous, happy,\r\n     and contented people, loyal, honest, industrious,\r\n     hospitable, ready always to entertain the stranger within\r\n     the gates. Farm life no longer carries with it the dreary\r\n     isolation and monotony of early pioneer life. The work is\r\n     done with modern machinery. Telephones extend to every home\r\n     in the township. Rural delivery takes the mail each morning\r\n     to their doors, and the latest literature is found on their\r\n     library tables. They are in touch with every phase of life.\r\n     The women no longer spin and weave, and then sew and knit,\r\n     but buy ready made the best that is manufactured.\r\n\r\n     When the day's work is done they come to town in their\r\n     automobiles, the women gowned in the latest fashions, to\r\n     enjoy an evening of social pleasure, engage in club work,\r\n     society work, lodge work, and church work. The village of\r\n     Waubeek has a ladies' improvement club, and they have built\r\n     over a mile of fine cement sidewalk.\r\n\r\n     As one rides over the great state of Iowa and sees its\r\n     flocks and herds, its fine homes, cities, towns, and\r\n     villages, the bounteous crops, and notes the intelligence\r\n     and contentment of its people, we are led with the red men\r\n     of virgin days to exclaim \"E-A-WAH,\" the beautiful land, and\r\n     no fairer spot can be found in its broad domain than Maine\r\n     township, of which we are all proud to be residents and\r\n     citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nJackson township is in the north tier of townships. It is bounded on\r\nthe north by Buchanan county, on the east by Boulder township, on the\r\nsouth by Maine and on the west by Spring Grove townships. It is well\r\nwatered by the Wapsie river as well as by Buffalo creek, both of which\r\nstreams traverse parts of the ground called for political purposes\r\nJackson township. The township is largely settled by Americans whose\r\nancestors located on these verdant prairies in the forties and fifties.\r\nThe township is supposed to have been named by David Sutton, in honor\r\nof his patron saint Andrew Jackson. James Lytle came from Indiana and\r\ntook up a claim here in 1841. He brought his wife who was a daughter of\r\nDavid Sutton, who located here in January, 1843, with a wife and nine\r\nchildren. The first white child born in the township was Frances, a\r\ndaughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Lytle. Sam W. Justice came in 1845 and\r\nerected a house on ground where now is the town of Paris, which was\r\nstaked out on the south bank of the Wapsie river on what is now\r\nsections 19 and 20, township 86, range 6. Sam Chamberlain opened the\r\nfirst store and established quite a trade, which later was shared by\r\nRob. C. Powell, who erected a more complete store building and provided\r\nmore pretentious quarters where he was besides store keeper the first\r\npostmaster. Dan McCrellis and Anos Bond located on lands on which this\r\nembryo town was started. Dave Long also saw fit to stop here in search\r\nof a home as early as 1848.\r\n\r\nMiss Pethenia Gray taught the first school about a half a mile west of\r\nParis in 1850. The first religious services were conducted by Rev.\r\nLittle at the home of Sam Justin. Jas. Nugent settled in section 12 in\r\nthe northeastern part of the county in 1847 at what for many years was\r\nknown as Nugent's Grove. Mr. Nugent was for many years justice, school\r\ndirector, township trustee, and held other offices. He was a leader of\r\nthe republican party for many years and well known over the county. He\r\ndied a number of years ago, the widow passing away at an advanced age\r\nin the fall of 1910. S. D. Mills settled here with his family in 1853,\r\nfollowed the following spring by F. M. Philips who came from Illinois,\r\nbut returned again and permanently located in the county three years\r\nlater. The years from 1854-1857 were the most active in the matter of\r\nland purchase in this township. In 1854 came Wm. Henderson of Scotch\r\ndescent from Canada with his family and located on lands a little to\r\nthe west of the present town of Coggon. A large number of the\r\ndescendants of this family are still large property owners and\r\nrespected and enterprising citizens of this township. E. L. Ware, Henry\r\nThorp, G. C. Edgerly and many others purchased lands and settled here\r\nduring these years. John Bruce in 1858 during the hard times had the\r\ncourage to erect a stone grist mill on Buffalo creek at the present\r\nsite of Coggon and this property later came into the possession of Amos\r\nGreen who operated the mill till 1876, when he erected a frame\r\nstructure. This mill was much appreciated by the settlers and it was a\r\nbusy place for many years. Up till the time of the Illinois Central\r\nrailway extension in 1887, the place was known as Green's Mill, later\r\ncalled Nugent, after the postoffice, and then named Coggon. The first\r\nstore at Green's Mill was run by John Bruce, who ran this in connection\r\nwith his mill. The advent of railroads brought up the price of lands,\r\nmarkets were offered for grain and rents at once advanced and since\r\nthat time the growth has been steady and healthful till Jackson\r\ntownship is not excelled by any other community in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINN TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nLinn township, in the southeastern part of the county, on account of\r\nits location was early settled by L. M. Kepler of Indiana, and G. A.\r\nYeisley of Pennsylvania, who came here as early as 1837. By 1840 a\r\nlarge number had located in the township, such as J. C. Goudy, Dan\r\nMcCall, Isaac Kyle and Oliver Clark who had emigrated from Ohio, Benj.\r\nHoover, Alex Torrance, Jas. Varner, who had come from Pennsylvania;\r\nChancy Neal, Geo. House, William Perkins and others from the eastern\r\nstates. Sam Ellison had come from Ireland, and J. W. Walton from\r\nEngland. The descendants of many of these early settlers are still\r\nresidents of the county, the owners of large farms, and of much\r\npersonal property.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1852-1857 that settlers came in any large numbers from\r\nthe eastern states. Then nearly all the vacant lands which had not\r\ngotten into the hands of speculators were for the most part taken up\r\nand improved. Linn township was on the so-called Anamosa-Iowa City\r\nroad, as well as on the Marion-Muscatine road, two of the early\r\nhighways.\r\n\r\nThe township cannot boast of any towns with the exception of Paralta,\r\nwhich is only a junction point of the Milwaukee system. The residents\r\ntrade at Mt. Vernon and Lisbon.\r\n\r\nIn this township can be found many descendants of the early settlers\r\nand even a few of the original pioneers. The Yeisley, Needles, Clark,\r\nNeal, Bussenbark, Ink, Leigh, Filloon, Ellison, Beechley, Chamberlain,\r\nStinger, Paul, Remington, Lacock, Stewart, Goudy, Boxwell, Kearns,\r\nBallard, Travis, and other well known early families are still owners\r\nof valuable farms within the confines of the old township borders.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTTER CREEK TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nOtter Creek township, containing thirty-six sections, situated nearly\r\nin the center of Linn county, has been considered one of the best\r\nfarming communities in Iowa for years. The soil is excellent and there\r\nhas always been plenty of water in the streams for cattle, which also\r\naffords good drainage for tilling purposes. During the last ten years\r\nnearly every acre of unproductive land has been reclaimed by a thorough\r\nsystem of drainage, so that now Otter Creek land sells at the top\r\nnotch.\r\n\r\nThe first settler was William Chamberlain, who located in what later\r\nbecame Monroe township, in 1838. He is the father of the famous\r\nChamberlain family who have made a fortune out of the patent medicine\r\nbusiness in Des Moines. The children of William and Rachel Chamberlain\r\nwere Davis and Lowell, and four daughters named Mrs. Mary Snyder, Mrs.\r\nLaura Weeks, Mrs. Lucy A. Taylor, and Isanna L. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nOther early settlers might be mentioned as follows: John Cochran,\r\nGeorge Cochran, Alexander Nevin, James Hemphill, William Ward, Nate\r\nReynolds, who came in the early '40s. Caleb Hendrix came, it is\r\nthought, in 1838. Of him, it is said by John Lanning, that old Caleb\r\nused to say that he made a claim and spread his tent on what became\r\nCedar Rapids, but that a lot of bloodthirsty and ferocious Indians\r\ncamped on the other side of the river and by their acts and grimaces\r\nand the noise they made Caleb sized up the situation that this was a\r\ncase where it would be better to be a live coward than a dead hero and\r\nhe pulled up stakes and removed further north, going to a number of\r\nplaces before he settled in Otter Creek township, where he finally\r\ndecided to make his home. Mr. Hendrix married a daughter of James\r\nHemphill in 1845 and for many years was a pillar in the Methodist\r\nchurch and an enthusiastic Sunday school worker.\r\n\r\nAmong other early settlers might be mentioned Perry Oliphant and his\r\nwife Susanna, as well as his sons Silas, Edward, John, William, and\r\nHenry, and his daughters Lizzie, Mary, and Rillar. These came in 1839\r\nor 1840. Another of the old, well respected families who came here in\r\nthe early '40s was the Neighbors. John Nevins erected the first saw\r\nmill in 1845 near what later became the village of Lafayette. This mill\r\nwas later owned by John Yambert, James Greene, and A. Brenaman, still\r\nlater it came into the possession of Fred Notebohn, who added a grist\r\nmill, and when the water gave out it was run by steam.\r\n\r\nOther of the old settlers were James Wallace, Alfred Thomas, William\r\nand Samuel Fleming, the Mounces, Seversons, Pences, Fishels, Browns,\r\nFees, Jackmans, Taylors, Chesmores, Hollenbecks, Andrews, Martins,\r\nMetcalfs, and many others.\r\n\r\nOne of the first stores kept was in the fall of 1847 when Morris\r\nNeighbor opened a small place in what was known as Shingle Town. This\r\nname, it is said, came about for the reason that clapboards were made\r\nin this vicinity.\r\n\r\nJohn Carr, having married Neighbor's sister, also lived here for some\r\ntime. The postoffice for Otter Creek township was moved around among\r\nthe old settlers from time to time and was kept, of course, in the farm\r\nhouses. William Hunt seems to have been the first postmaster. The\r\noffice was afterwards removed and the postmastership held by Perry\r\nOliphant, and later again removed, with Richard Lanning in charge.\r\nDuring the Civil war the postoffice was conducted by Yambert, Polley,\r\nand Moller. It was around the postoffice and country store that\r\npolitics were discussed and news of the neighborhood commented upon,\r\nand it was also here that the pioneer settlers became acquainted and\r\nfriendships were formed which continued through life. For this reason,\r\nno doubt, the country postoffice and the country store did much in an\r\nearly day to lessen the hardships in pioneer life.\r\n\r\nOtter Creek township was early visited by itinerary ministers, and as\r\nearly as 1853 a Christian church was organized. William Kalb, John\r\nYambert, and others being some of the first evangelical preachers in\r\nthis part of the county. One of the first county meetings of this\r\nchurch was held at the home of George Cochran as early as 1859. The\r\nEvangelical church was later organized in this township and some of the\r\nearly ministers in this denomination were Rev. Borchart, Rev. Maerz,\r\nRev. Gerhart, Rev. Mayne, Rev. Brecher.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nCollege township is situated in the southern tier of townships in the\r\ncounty, the southern boundary being the county line between Johnson and\r\nLinn counties, while on the east and west respectively are Fairfax and\r\nPutnam townships. College township is well watered and well drained by\r\nseveral water courses, the principal ones being the Cedar river,\r\nHoosier creek, and Prairie creek. It contains no towns of any size but\r\nmost of its traffic is now conducted by the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City\r\nelectric line running from Cedar Rapids to Iowa City. Much of the\r\ncream, milk and other products of the farm are shipped daily over this\r\nline to Cedar Rapids; since the construction of this line land in\r\nCollege township has gone up in price and the beautiful farm houses,\r\nmagnificent and well tilled fields speak well for the population of\r\nthis part of the county.\r\n\r\nSome of the old settlers of College township are the following: Isaac\r\nSmith, Phillip Smith, Dr. J. H. Smith, James Smith, and others of the\r\nSmith family who came here in the early '50s. During the next few years\r\ncame John Lagore, Joseph Custer, Jacob Inbody, the Garnett family,\r\nThomas Philipson, Horn, Henry Rogers, Fritz family, James Snyder, W. F.\r\nMinor, Joshua Minor, Sam Minor, the Bakers, and many others.\r\n\r\nOne of the first Baptist churches was erected at Rogers Grove, and a\r\nlarge number of the early settlers in this community belonged to that\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nBY A. W. FISHER\r\n\r\nSpring Grove township is situated in the northern tier of townships in\r\nLinn county. It is bordered on the north by Newton township, Buchanan\r\ncounty, on the east by Jackson, on the south by Otter Creek, and on the\r\nwest by Grant. The land is generally an undulating prairie excepting a\r\nstrip about two miles wide beginning at the northwest corner of the\r\ntownship in section six, and extending in a southeasterly direction to\r\nsection twenty-four on the east side of the township, through which the\r\nWapsipinicon river flows. The land near the river on both sides is not\r\nonly hilly, but consists of a light sandy soil, and was almost covered\r\nwith a heavy growth of timber in the early pioneer days. Back from the\r\nriver about one mile the land is prairie and has a deep black loam.\r\n\r\nThe early settlements of Spring Grove township were connected with the\r\nsettlements in the neighboring townships, and divided themselves into\r\nthree groups. The first one was on the north side of the Wapsipinicon\r\nriver, while another settlement was made in the southeastern part of\r\nthe township in what is called West Prairie, and the third settlement\r\nwas in the western part of the township. The earliest settlers located\r\nalong the Wapsipinicon river where the soil is of a poorer quality than\r\nit was on the open prairie. The reason for their choice was to secure\r\ntimber for their buildings and for fuel. In a few cases the settlers\r\nwere grouped around springs that furnished them with water.\r\n\r\nGame was abundant in those days and this helped the pioneer during the\r\nlong cold winters. Large herds of deer were often seen along the timber\r\nnear the river and on the prairies. Wolves were too plentiful to suit\r\nthe settler as they prowled around his cabin during the night and\r\ncarried off poultry whenever the chance offered. Panthers were rarely\r\nseen but were too numerous for the more timid in those days. Often\r\ncattle and hogs were missing and their loss was attributed to the work\r\nof the panther. The early settlers of Spring Grove township did not\r\nescape the discomforts of the average pioneer. Their houses were, at\r\nthe best, rudely constructed of logs, and the stoves used in those days\r\nwere very poor. Many of the old settlers have informed me that their\r\ncoffee, when they were lucky enough to secure it, was often frozen\r\nafter being placed on the breakfast table.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement was on the north side of the Wapsipinicon river\r\naround two springs. One of them was in a grove in Newton township,\r\nBuchanan county, and the other one a short distance southeast in a\r\ngrove in our township. To distinguish them the early pioneers called\r\nthem the Upper and Lower Spring Grove. The name of Spring Grove then\r\ncame in general use for the entire settlement and was adopted by our\r\nsettlers as the name of their township.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VIEW OF CEDAR RAPIDS FROM THE ISLAND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILROAD YARDS AT CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\nThe first settler in Spring Grove township was Leonard Austin, who with\r\nhis family settled in section one of our township in the spring of\r\n1845, and erected the first building from rough unhewn logs taken from\r\nthe timber surrounding his building site. Mr. Austin was followed by A.\r\nJ. Ward, who with his family settled near Mr. Austin during the fall of\r\nthat year. Two years later, in 1847, Josiah Walton and Rev. Wm.\r\nPhillips settled as near neighbors to these hardy pioneers. These were\r\nsoon followed by the Reeces, Holmans, Longs, McPikes, Peytons, Carsons,\r\nWhisenands, McKees, Fays, and Waltons, who settled in the northern part\r\nof our township and in the southern part of Newton township in Buchanan\r\ncounty, and who are remembered as the early pioneers.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers of the southeastern part of the township were the\r\nBices, Andersons, Saxtons, Leathermans, Plummers, Swaims, Frank Dorr,\r\nE. B. Fisher, Bumgardners, Benedicts, McBurneys, Nutting, Carpenters,\r\nand Jordans. These settlers formed part of a settlement that extended\r\ninto Jackson township. They located there during the early part of the\r\n'50s. About the same time the western part of the township south of the\r\nWapsipinicon river was settled. Those early settlers were Edwin\r\nJeffreys, A. G. Kibbe, Elmer and J. E. Atwood, father and son, Chas.\r\nCook and sons, Edwin, Enos, George, and Charles, and George Parkhurst.\r\nAll these early pioneers took an active part in helping to develop the\r\nnew country.\r\n\r\nIn regard to religious worship the people of Spring Grove may be\r\nlikened to the Puritans of the early colonial period, as among the\r\nearliest settlers came Rev. Wm. Phillips, a minister of the gospel who\r\nat first conducted meetings in his own home, and later became a\r\n\"circuit rider,\" holding meetings every Sunday either in some private\r\nhouse or in a school house. The Christian organization that is now at\r\nTroy Mills was organized by Henry Holman during the summer of 1853 in\r\nJohn W. McKee's house near what is now Troy Mills. Mr. Holman preached\r\nthe first sermon and continued as pastor until the organization was\r\nstrong enough to secure a minister to take charge of the work. Isaac\r\nHolman, now a resident of Troy Mills, and a son of Henry Holman, was\r\nthe first superintendent of the Sunday school organized in the\r\ntownship. Rev. N. A. McConnell, of Marion, was one of the ablest\r\nministers of the early period, and would face the worst storms of the\r\nseason in order to keep his appointment. The people living in the\r\nsoutheastern part of the township at first held services in private\r\nhouses until the West Prairie school house was erected, where for\r\nseveral years they had a place for worship. They now have a splendid\r\nchurch near the West Prairie school house.\r\n\r\nThe first justice of the peace of Spring Grove township was John\r\nPlummer, but the best known justices of the peace of the early times\r\nwere Elmer Atwood, Josiah Walton, and Wm. Bleakley. While the people of\r\nthose days were not free from strife among themselves, yet they were\r\nobliged to band together to free themselves from a worse evil--the\r\nhorse thief. The people finally with the help of the neighboring\r\nsettlers took the law in their own hands and dealt summary justice to\r\nthe offenders. One of these thieves was followed by a posse to his camp\r\non the Buffalo creek in Buchanan county, and on his refusal to\r\nsurrender he was shot to death. This put a stop to the stealing.\r\n\r\nIn politics the people of Spring Grove always took an active part, and\r\nfor a long time claimed to be the banner republican precinct of the\r\nstate. During the Civil war the republicans of West Prairie erected a\r\nflag pole on the bare prairie near where now stands the West Prairie\r\nchurch and raised the Stars and Stripes aloft and kept the flag there\r\nuntil long after the war closed. At one election during the Civil war\r\nnot a democratic vote was cast. It was said that there were a few\r\ndemocrats in the township but they chose to stay at home rather than\r\nstand the jeers that were sure to assail them if they voted.\r\n\r\nTroy Mills, the only village in the township, was founded in 1853, when\r\na dam was built across the river at that place and a saw mill built.\r\nThis mill continued to run about ten years when the present mill was\r\nerected. The mill did a flourishing business grinding all kinds of\r\ngrain, but of late years has only been used as a grist mill. Jordon\r\nLong brought the first stock of goods to Troy Mills, amounting to ten\r\ndollars. Meeting with success in selling these, he turned all his\r\nattention to carrying on a general store which he conducted for more\r\nthan forty years. Dr. John Dix and E. C. Downs started the first drug\r\nstore in the town but soon sold out. E. N. Beach, one of the best known\r\nmen in the northern part of Linn county, came to Troy Mills at an early\r\nday and started a drug store and has conducted the same to the present\r\ntime. Dr. E. Wilson was the only doctor in our township for several\r\nyears and enjoyed a lucrative practice. The first blacksmith shop was\r\nstarted by Elmer and John E. Atwood in 1854, who conducted the same for\r\nnearly thirty years.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the old settlers remain who helped to transform the wilds\r\ninto what it is today. Those now living here, who came in the early\r\n'50s, are David Reece, Isaac Holman, John E. Attwood, Mrs. Edwin\r\nJeffries, Isaac Bice, Enos and Charles Cook. The others have either\r\nmoved away or passed into that great beyond from which no traveler\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TOWNSHIP\r\n\r\nWashington township was early settled, for it is stated on good\r\nauthority that Bartimus McGonigle settled near what later became Center\r\nPoint in 1839. Some of the early settlers were Dr. S. M. Brice, John\r\nOsborn, Tom Lockhart, W. A. Thomas, James Down, Sam Stewart, E. B.\r\nSpencer, Alex Nevin, D. S. Way, Milt Squires, Will Cress, Jacob Thomas,\r\nRobert Osborn, Jonathan Dennison, Alex Thomas, Jas. Chambers. These\r\ncame as early as 1842, a number coming in in 1839 and 1840. The\r\nfollowing came before 1846: Thos. Fee, Isaac Berry, J. L. Benham, Levi\r\nMartin, L. Hollenbeck.\r\n\r\nThe town was laid out in 1848 by Andrew Bottorf. A re-survey was later\r\nmade as of 1854, and done by J. McArthur for Dr. S. M. Brice and J. R.\r\nGrubb.\r\n\r\nMost of the buildings in the town date from the time of the second\r\nplat, when the place began to thrive in earnest. Dr. Brice ran a store\r\nwhich was later sold to A. A. Adams. In 1855 Dr. J. P. Wilson opened a\r\ndrug store. L. Hollenbeck also opened a general store in 1854. J. M.\r\nBartleson, W. S. Bliss, and John Carr were also early settlers, Carr\r\nand Bartleson running a store for many years.\r\n\r\nThe locality in and around Center Point, then, is one of the first\r\nsettled in the county. The early settlers were enterprising and the\r\nnewcomers were made welcome. No doubt the close proximity to the river\r\nand the abundance of timber in this locality made the place inviting to\r\nthe new settlers who needed above everything else timber for use in\r\nbuilding and for fuel. The railroad which the people had expected many\r\nyears did not get into town till in 1873, and was continued the\r\nfollowing spring. For the purpose of securing this railroad Washington\r\ntownship voted $16,000, being about a five per cent tax.\r\n\r\nIn Washington township lived and died many years ago John Osborn, a\r\nrevolutionary soldier, who is buried in Center Point cemetery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n_Lisbon and the United Brethren Church_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn narrating the history of Linn county mention must be made of that\r\nbody of devoted men and women who early laid the foundations of the\r\nUnited Brethren church in this portion of what sixty years ago was the\r\nfar west. The members of this christian body have had an important and\r\nconspicuous part in the history of our county. Their leaders have not\r\nonly been men of piety, but they have also been men of ability,\r\nbuilders of commonwealths. Their work has been of a permanent\r\ncharacter, and the descendants of these pioneer people are today doing\r\ngrandly the work so nobly begun seventy years ago.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do better here than to quote largely from the _Historical\r\nSouvenir of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ at Lisbon,\r\nIowa, 1836-1904_, by Rev. Cyrus J. Kephart, published in 1904 by the\r\nLisbon _Herald_:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH IN IOWA\r\n\r\nThe work of the United Brethren in Christ in Iowa began, as far as\r\nknown, with the labors of Rev. Christian Troup, a member of the Wabash\r\nConference, who came to Iowa as a missionary in 1836,[N] and settled\r\nupon what is now a part of the site of Mount Vernon. He afterwards\r\ntraded his 160 acre claim for a yoke of oxen, and settled near the\r\nCedar river, on what is now known as the Horn farm. Here he passed\r\nthrough all the privations of a frontier life. His daughter, Mrs. Pate,\r\nstates that for a considerable time he and his family ground the corn\r\nfor their bread on an old-fashioned coffee mill nailed to the side of a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nRev. Troup's field as a missionary extended from the city of Dubuque to\r\nHenry county. His preaching places were wherever he could find an\r\nopportunity to speak to the people. Thus he sowed the seed that\r\nafterward ripened into many an active Christian life.\r\n\r\nOne of his appointments was near Ivanhoe, in a log house of only two\r\nrooms. Here standing in the low doorway he would speak first to those\r\ngathered in one room, then stooping, for he was a tall man, he would\r\npass his head into the other room and speak to those there.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1850 and was buried in the cemetery that then occupied the\r\nlot where the house of Mrs. Mary Hoover now stands in Lisbon. When the\r\ncemetery was changed his remains were removed to the present Lisbon\r\ncemetery.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Rev. John Burns, a local preacher, settled in Lee county, and\r\nbegan preaching at various points. Rev. Christian Troup and he seem to\r\nhave been the pioneers of the United Brethren in Christ in Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe first society was organized at the home of \"Father\" Edington,\r\nprobably somewhere in Henry county, in October, 1841. This, however,\r\nwas several years after Christian Troup began his work in the community\r\nin which Lisbon now stands.\r\n\r\nThe first United Brethren quarterly conference west of the Mississippi\r\nwas held at the home of Mr. Gibson near the present site of Lisbon, May\r\n10, 1842. It was attended by Christian Troup, F. R. S. Byrd, Ira B.\r\nRyan, Lewis Hoffman, \"Father\" Edington, and others. Ira B. Ryan was\r\nlicensed to preach, and Christian Troup was chosen presiding elder.\r\n\r\nAnother similar meeting was held in Henry county on September 10th of\r\nthe same year. Considerable annual conference business was transacted\r\nat this meeting.\r\n\r\nA third meeting of the same character was held, probably in the\r\nsouthern part of the state in March, 1843, there being present a\r\npresiding elder of the Wabash Conference, of the territory of which\r\nIowa at that time was a part. At this meeting there were reported\r\nthirteen organized societies, with one hundred and ninety-four members\r\nin Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe first annual conference of the United Brethren in Iowa, and the\r\nfirst west of the Mississippi, convened at Columbus City, May 19, 1844,\r\nBishop Henry Kumler, Jr., presiding. It was called the Iowa Branch of\r\nthe Wabash Conference.\r\n\r\nThe next annual conference convened at the home of Wm. Thompson, in\r\nLouisa county, August 14, 1845, Bishop John Russell, presiding. At this\r\nsession the Iowa conference was formally organized.\r\n\r\nOther early conferences were held as follows:\r\n\r\nAt Columbus City, August 31, 1846, Bishop J. J. Glossbrenner,\r\npresiding.\r\n\r\nAt the home of Wm. Thompson, Louisa county, August 24, 1847, Bishop Wm.\r\nHanby, presiding.\r\n\r\nAt the home of John Shively, Henry county, September 1, 1848, Bishop\r\nWm. Hanby, presiding.\r\n\r\nAt the Hershey school house near Lisbon, August 23, 1849, Bishop David\r\nEdwards, presiding.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the preachers in charge of the territory including\r\nLisbon were:\r\n\r\n     1843-44 John Peters.\r\n     1844-45 Christian Troup.\r\n     1845-47 J. W. Sterling.\r\n     1847-48 Luther McVay.\r\n     1848-49 Luther McVay, with John DeMoss, assistant.\r\n\r\nWriting of the Iowa conference of 1845, Bishop Russell said: \"Myself\r\nand wife left the state of Maryland in a carriage for Iowa. A tedious\r\njourney indeed. All went well until we got between the two\r\nrivers--Mississippi and Iowa. In the high prairie grass our trail ran\r\nout, and of course we were lost. How to get on the right course was the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\"I went before, parting the grass, which was much higher than myself.\r\nAfter I had gone a certain distance, I put my hat on my cane to guide\r\nmy wife to the spot. Thus I continued for some time till we got right\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED BRETHREN AT LISBON\r\n\r\nOur life and work at Lisbon date back to the faithful labors of Rev.\r\nChristian Troup, who began preaching in this vicinity as early as 1836.\r\nHence the church at Lisbon had its beginning with the very beginning of\r\nour church in Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe work here grew slowly, however, for several years, Bro. Troup often\r\nadvising his converts to join other churches on account of the weakness\r\nof the United Brethren in Iowa.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Rev. Christian Hershey led quite a large colony, chiefly his\r\nown relatives, from Pennsylvania to Iowa, and settled in Yankee Grove,\r\nthe section of country surrounding where Lisbon now stands.\r\n\r\nThis colony, being largely composed of United Brethren, made quite an\r\naddition to the United Brethren forces of this vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn August of the same year Rev. Luther McVay was appointed to the\r\nYankee Grove circuit. During the summer of 1848 he held a camp-meeting\r\non the knoll now occupied by the Washington school building of Lisbon,\r\nwith good results. He then organized \"the United Brethren class in the\r\nPennsylvania Settlement of Linn county, Iowa,\" with a charter\r\nmembership of about forty, as nearly as can be determined from the\r\noriginal class book. About twelve names were afterward added, the year\r\nclosing with a membership of 52. The effecting of an organization was\r\nstrongly opposed by many of the older persons who took an active part\r\nin the camp-meeting; not because of opposition to the church, but\r\nfeeling that it was not right to formally organize and put the names on\r\na class book.\r\n\r\nOf these charter members, two are yet members of the church, Mr.\r\nMichael Blessing, and Mrs. Nancy Neidig.\r\n\r\nOn August 23, 1849, the Iowa annual conference was held here. Lisbon\r\nhad just been platted, and homes were scarce. To meet the difficulty\r\noccasioned by the coming of so many ministers, a camp-meeting was\r\nplanned; tents were built on the camp ground, and the conference was\r\nheld in connection with the camp-meeting. There were a number of\r\nconversions, and at the close of the camp-meeting twenty-five persons\r\nwere baptized in the Cedar river near Ivanhoe, by Rev. Josiah Lindsey.\r\n\r\nRev. Christian Hershey and Rev. D. Wenrich were received into the\r\nconference at this session upon their transfers. Rev. John De Moss,\r\nassistant pastor of Yankee Grove circuit, reported $26.55 received as\r\nsalary and presents for the year.\r\n\r\nThe Lisbon class proper, at first called North Yankee Grove class, was\r\norganized September 5, 1850, by Rev. S. W. Kern, pastor. The original\r\nrecord shows 36 members of this class, many of whom belonged to the\r\n\"United Brethren Class in the Pennsylvania Settlement in Linn county,\r\nIowa,\" and several were new members. That there existed some difficulty\r\nin connection with the work at this place at that time is manifest from\r\nthe following from Rev. D. Wenrich in an article in the _Telescope_\r\nrelative to the conference session of 1850: \"On account of a peculiar\r\nstate of things on Yankee Grove circuit it was asked that a good\r\ndisciplinarian be appointed to the charge. The selection of Rev. S. W.\r\nKern and the adjustment of the difficulty proved the wisdom of the\r\nchoice.\" Just what the difficulty was, whether it was among members of\r\nthe church of a personal character, or whether it was something in\r\nconnection with the administration of the affairs of the church, there\r\nis no record to show.\r\n\r\nThe annual conference of 1852 chose Lisbon as the place of meeting for\r\nthe next annual session. Rev. Christian Hershey, who had been in an\r\nimportant sense the father of the Lisbon church, looked forward to its\r\ncoming with great expectations. When the time arrived for making\r\nnecessary local preparation, he joined most heartily in the work. After\r\ncleaning the church and putting everything in readiness, he proposed to\r\na friend who was with him to go into the church and offer prayer for\r\nthe conference. He was in great joy. But on August 3d, the day before\r\nthe assembling of conference, very suddenly the death angel called, and\r\nFather Hershey passed away. His death cast a gloom over the entire\r\nsession. Rev. George Miller was chosen to preach the funeral sermon.\r\nThe conference in a body marched before his corpse to the church and to\r\nthe grave. His remains were buried in the cemetery beside the church\r\nand afterwards were removed to the present Lisbon cemetery, where they\r\nnow rest.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the church following the year 1849 was quite rapid. But\r\nit is impossible to determine what the total membership has been, on\r\naccount of the mutilation of the early records. So far as we can learn\r\nthe number of persons received between 1840 and 1870 was fully five\r\nhundred. Since 1870 the accessions have been quite numerous. A number\r\nof very successful revivals have been held. From 1870 to the present\r\ntime, as nearly as can be determined, the number of accessions has\r\nbeen about 790, thus showing a membership of nearly 1,300 since the\r\norganization of the church in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe Lisbon charge has been favored with a number of most excellent\r\npastors. So far as the records show, the largest increase of membership\r\nwas during the pastorate of Rev. William Cunningham. During his service\r\nof eighteen months there were eighty-four additions to the church.\r\n\r\nAmong those who have assisted largely to the development and growth of\r\nthe church, the following seem to deserve special mention: Christian\r\nHershey, Michael Hoover, Sr., D. Runkle, John Neidig, Jacob Kettering,\r\nA. A. Sweet, Samuel Long, John Eby, Lawrence Easterly, J. E. Kurtz, D.\r\nDorwart, Henry Meyers, John Ringer, Sr., Elias Hahn, D. Buck, John\r\nTurner, George Graul, D. G. Zeigenfus, Thomas Runkle, C. H. Neidig,\r\nAbram Runkle, Adam Runkle, Amos Runkle, W. S. Furnas, Elizabeth Perry,\r\nNancy Neidig, Sr., Mother Bressler, Anna Bitzer and Elizabeth N.\r\nRunkle. The list could be greatly enlarged with perfect truthfulness.\r\nBut these are among the number who seem to have stood out with special\r\nprominence in the work of the church.\r\n\r\nWe would make special mention of Rev. S. E. Long, Rev. A. B. Statton,\r\nand Rev. M. S. Runkle, who were raised as members of our church and\r\nhave gone into the ministry of the gospel.\r\n\r\nAlso Mrs. G. K. Little, daughter of Bro. J. Bittinger, whose sweet\r\nvoice and loving life are living epistles for Christ, greatly assisting\r\nin the evangelistic work of her husband, Rev. G. K. Little, who for\r\nyears was a faithful member here.\r\n\r\nRev. I. L. Buchwalter and his devoted wife, who have made Lisbon their\r\nhome since he retired from the active ministry, have been active and\r\nliberal in their devotion to the interests and work of the church.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Rev. Christian Hershey built in Lisbon, chiefly at his own\r\nexpense, the First United Brethren church west of the Mississippi\r\nriver. This church, which still stands just north of Mrs. Mary Hoover's\r\nresidence, was soon outgrown. In 1855 it was sold, and the proceeds\r\nwere used in building the second church on the site occupied by the\r\npresent edifice. This building served the church for twenty-six years.\r\n\r\nDuring the pastorate of Rev. T. D. Adams and the early part of the\r\nfirst pastorate of Rev. I. K. Statton, the need of a more modern church\r\nbecame apparent. At the session of the quarterly conference on April 7,\r\n1880, the first official steps were taken toward the erection of a new\r\nbuilding. During the following summer the old church was torn down, and\r\nthe present structure begun. It was completed at a cost of $9,200.00,\r\nand on January 23, 1881, was dedicated by Bishop Milton Wright. Great\r\ncredit is due to the ever earnest and faithful labors of the pastor,\r\nDr. I. K. Statton.\r\n\r\nDuring the building of the new church, the congregation was favored in\r\nbeing granted the use of the Methodist Episcopal church for all its\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSONAGES\r\n\r\nThe church during its history has owned three parsonages. The present\r\nbuilding is an elegant frame structure of eight rooms, furnished with\r\nfurnace, electric light, and city water. It was purchased during the\r\nsummer of 1903 for $2,400, the old one being sold for $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUNDAY SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe Sunday school was organized early in the history of the Lisbon\r\nchurch, probably in the spring of 1853. It was first conducted as a\r\nunion school, and so continued for a number of years, its development\r\ninto a United Brethren school being the result chiefly of the\r\norganization of other schools in town.\r\n\r\nAt the first it was divided into male and female departments, with five\r\nmale and seven female classes; among them were one female and two male\r\nspelling classes, and one female infant class. Among the first scholars\r\nwere Henry C. Kurtz, and Solomon Kettering, who are yet living. The\r\nrecord of 1854 shows three infant classes, one male and two female. In\r\nthe male class were two of our present members, Henry C. Meyers, and\r\nJacob E. Meyers, with their father Henry Meyers as teacher.\r\n\r\nThe first secretary's record that is preserved begins with July, 1857.\r\nThe enrollment was 121, the attendance 118. The superintendent was A.\r\nA. Sweet. May 27, 1860, is named as \"the first day of the\r\nadministration of B. [Benjamin] Hoover as superintendent, to which\r\noffice he was elected last night.\" Other evidence states that Adam\r\nRunkle had served as superintendent, one year before this election.\r\nFollowing this the record shows nothing as to who was superintendent\r\ntill April 2, 1865, when it states, \"Had our annual election last\r\nevening for officers. Adam Runkle was re-elected superintendent, D.\r\nDorwart, secretary, D. Buck, librarian.\" I. Scoles is the first\r\nsecretary named, his election occurring May 2, 1858. The next named\r\nfollowing him is J. E. Kurtz, who served a number of years, his term of\r\noffice terminating with the election of D. Dorwart as above noted.\r\n\r\nThe enrollment did not increase rapidly, owing in part no doubt to the\r\norganizing of other schools. On January 1, 1860, it was 144; on January\r\n6, 1861, 145, with 140 in attendance.\r\n\r\nThe record from 1857 to 1865 is rendered quite interesting by the\r\nrecital of current events of the town and community. A few are here\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n     July 26, 1857. \"A stranger bathing last Sabbath in the Cedar\r\n     river was drowned. Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy.\"\r\n\r\n     December 15, 1857. \"Officers and teachers agreed to have a\r\n     teachers' meeting monthly.\"\r\n\r\n     April 11, 1859. \"The Lutheran church organized a Sunday\r\n     school in the old church today.\"\r\n\r\n     July 9, 1859. \"The school was opened at eight o'clock on\r\n     account of the Methodist quarterly meeting in this house at\r\n     nine o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n     November 6, 1859. \"Small attendance on account of wedding in\r\n     town, Mr. Joel Ringer and Miss Barbara Kurtz.\"\r\n\r\n     July 29, 1860. \"Bishop Glossbrenner was here yesterday, and\r\n     went to Western.\"\r\n\r\n     September 9, 1860. \"We hear for the first time two bells\r\n     ringing in town.\"\r\n\r\n     October 28, 1860. \"Mrs. Easterly married to David Zeigenfus.\"\r\n\r\n     November 11, 1860. \"Old Abe elected.\"\r\n\r\n     September 21, 1861. \"Yesterday great military demonstration;\r\n     young men leaving for the army.\"\r\n\r\n     November 1, 1863. \"Yesterday all the liquor destroyed by the\r\n     sheriff.\"\r\n\r\n     November 29, 1863. \"No school in consequence of the\r\n     Evangelical dedication.\"\r\n\r\n     January 16, 1865. \"Large school, as both schools are united.\"\r\n     \"Both schools\" seems to refer to our own and a Sunday school\r\n     conducted for a short time by the Presbyterians. Enrollment\r\n     129; attendance 166.\r\n\r\n     April 16, 1865. \"Our church was draped in memory of the death\r\n     of our late President, Abraham Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\n     May 7, 1865. \"The Missionary Board met with us. Bishops\r\n     Edwards, Markwood, and Kumler, and Revs. S. VonNeida and J.\r\n     W. Shuey were present.\"\r\n\r\nReference is frequently made to deaths that occurred in town. The\r\nburial of several soldiers is noted. The secretaries of later years\r\nrecorded but little of such general events. The record of June 6,\r\n1880, says: \"On account of tearing down the church, school met in M. E.\r\nchurch at 2:00 p. m.\" On May 26, 1878, I. K. Statton, Mrs. T. D. Adams,\r\nJ. Bittinger, Amos Runkle and wife and Miss Sue Fletcher were appointed\r\ndelegates to the township and the county conventions.\r\n\r\nThe superintendents have been A. A. Sweet, Benjamin Hoover, Adam\r\nRunkle, J. Bittinger, W. H. Runkle, J. S. Smith, U. D. Runkle, and the\r\npresent incumbent, Amos K. Runkle, who has served the school\r\ncontinuously for sixteen years, and has just been reelected.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Missionary Association of the United Brethren church of\r\nLisbon, was organized October 27, 1878, with the direction and\r\nassistance of Mrs. A. L. Billheimer. Mrs. T. D. Adams was appointed\r\ntemporary secretary. The following officers were elected: Mrs. Mary\r\nShaler, president; Mrs. A. K. Runkle, vice president; Mrs. Addie Eby,\r\nsecretary; Mrs. Lizzie A. Runkle, treasurer; solicitors: Mrs. E. N.\r\nRunkle, Mrs. Holderman, Mrs. Nancy Neidig, Miss Maggie Houser, Mrs.\r\nKatie Kurtz.\r\n\r\nThe first regular meeting was held at the parsonage and was opened by\r\ndevotional exercises by Mrs. Charlotte Davis (wife of Rev. Wm. Davis).\r\n\r\n\r\nLISBON CAMP-MEETING\r\n\r\nThe earliest camp-meeting of our church in this vicinity, as far as can\r\nbe learned, was held in 1848 on the site of the present school\r\nbuilding. It was followed by the second in 1849, and a third in 1852.\r\nSimilar meetings were held at various times and places for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt a quarterly conference held July 7, 1879, a camp-meeting committee\r\nwas appointed, consisting of Rev. T. D. Adams, and brothers J.\r\nBittinger, D. Runkle, C. H. Neidig, A. E. Kurtz, A. K. Runkle, George\r\nRupert, Sr., and J. S. Smith. The committee organized on July 11,\r\nelecting Rev. T. D. Adams, president, and Rev. I. K. Statton,\r\nsecretary. A plot of ground of about twenty-five acres, lying one and\r\none-fourth miles southeast of Lisbon was purchased, and a camp-meeting\r\nplanned to begin on August 26 following. At this time the temporary\r\norganization was succeeded by a permanent one, with Rev. T. D. Adams,\r\npresident, and J. Bittinger, secretary. On September 3d, the grounds\r\nwere dedicated by Bishop Milton Wright, Rev. T. D. Adams, Pastor, Rev.\r\nI. K. Statton, presiding elder, and a number of other ministers\r\nassisting.\r\n\r\nThe ground was a nicely wooded tract, with two good springs, and was\r\nfitted up with a number of neat cottages, a boarding house, chapel,\r\nspeakers' stand, and seats, and was enclosed with a substantial fence.\r\nAmong the prominent men who at different times took part in the\r\nmeetings were, Bishops Weaver, Kephart, Hott, Mills, and Wright,\r\nPresident W. M. Beardshear, and Dr. J. W. Etter. Interesting meetings\r\nwere held each summer up to and including 1893. Some hindrance at\r\nlength arose, and at the annual meeting held on August 27, 1894, the\r\nassociation voted to sell the grounds and disorganize.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF PASTORS, YANKEE GROVE CIRCUIT AND LISBON STATION\r\n\r\n1843-44 John Peters\r\n1843-44 Christian Troup\r\n1845-57 J.

This is\r\nsaid to have been the most quiet election on record. Gradually the\r\npeople located claims, as more lands were thrown open to settlement,\r\nand politics began to cut a figure at an early date. While many of the\r\nsettlers came from the south, a majority, however, came from Ohio, from\r\nthe middle states, and from New England. Thus it would appear that the\r\npopulation of Iowa was a part of the free state movement which had\r\npeopled the central states. The foreign population did not come to Iowa\r\nuntil the early '50s, when the Germans, Scandinavians, Scotch, and\r\nIrish came in large numbers to take up the cheap lands which were\r\noffered to the settlers.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers were for the most part democrats, with a sprinkling\r\nof whigs and abolitionists. Some of these voted for Taylor for\r\npresident in 1844, nearly all of whom supported Fremont later.\r\n\r\nThus in Brown township Ed Crow, Horace Brown, and the Butlers were\r\ndemocrats, while the Plummers, Yocums, Hamptons, Stanleys, and Dewees\r\nfamilies were originally whigs, who joined the republican party in\r\n1856. In Franklin township the members of the United Brethren church in\r\nand around Lisbon, and the Methodists around Mount Vernon were stanch\r\nabolitionists, joining the republican party when that was formed.\r\nAround Bertram a large number affiliated with the democratic party,\r\nwhich was true of the settlers in and around Center Point. In the\r\nnorthern part of the county, James Nugent, A. C. Coquillette, Joe\r\nWhitney, Peter Henderson, and many others were republicans, or joined\r\nthe party later. In Maine township the Jordan families were divided in\r\npolitics, some belonging to one party, others to another. These men\r\nwere a sturdy lot of pioneers and did much in a political and financial\r\nway to build up the county.\r\n\r\nIn Rapids township and Cedar Rapids, many of the old settlers were\r\ndemocrats, such as N. B. Brown, D. M. McIntosh, the Bryan boys, E. R.\r\nDerby, William Harper, the Weares, J. J. Snouffer, Hart brothers, and\r\nmany others. Judge Greene was one of the most prominent democrats who\r\njoined the republican ranks in the Greeley campaign. The Weares joined\r\nthe republican party during the Civil war period. Some of the prominent\r\nrepublicans of an early day were E. N. Bates, the Carrolls, Elys,\r\nLeaches, Higleys, J. S. and T. Z. Cook, Isaac Cook, Dr. S. D.\r\nCarpenter, Dr. E. L. Mansfield, Gabriel Carpenter.\r\n\r\nIn Marion township, which was then and for many years afterwards the\r\npolitical center of the county, the whigs, who later became\r\nrepublicans, were such men as N. M. Hubbard, R. D. Stephens, Joseph\r\nYoung, William Cook, William G. Thompson, James E. Bromwell, William\r\nSmythe, Robert Smythe, Robert Holmes, the Herveys, and the Daniels\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAmong the democrats were such prominent men as Colonel I. M. Preston,\r\nS. H. Tryon, S. W. Durham, H. W. Gray, Dr. T. S. Bardwell, T. J.\r\nMcKean, J. C. Barry, James Green, L. M. Strong, C. T. Williams, and\r\nJames Brown.\r\n\r\nDuring the territorial days Robert Lucas was a democrat, while John\r\nChambers was a whig, succeeded by James Clarke, another democrat.\r\nDuring these early territorial days Linn county cut very little figure\r\nin the affairs of the newly organized territory, as the river counties\r\nhad most of the settlers and otherwise controlled political affairs in\r\ngeneral. In the first assembly which met at Burlington, November 11,\r\n1838, this county was represented by Charles Whittelsy in the council,\r\nand by Robert G. Roberts in the house. The district then was composed\r\nof Cedar, Johnson, Jones, and Linn counties.\r\n\r\nThe second assembly met at the same place November 4, 1839, this\r\ndistrict being represented in the council by Charles Whittelsy, and by\r\nGeorge H. Walworth in the house. The district this year was composed of\r\nCedar, Jones, and Linn counties.\r\n\r\nThe third assembly convened at Burlington November 2, 1840, and now,\r\nfor the first time, Linn county was represented in the council by a\r\nresident of the county, in the person of George Greene. In the house\r\nsat George H. Walworth and H. Van Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThe fourth assembly convened at the newly selected capital at Iowa\r\nCity, and in the council or upper house sat again George Greene, and in\r\nthe house were Thomas Higginson and Thomas Denson.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth assembly sat J. P. Cook in the council and George H.\r\nWalworth and J. C. Barry in the house, the latter being a resident of\r\nLinn county.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth assembly sat J. P. Cook in the council, George H. Walworth\r\nand Robert Smythe in the house, Smythe being a resident of the county.\r\nFor many years he was a prominent politician in Iowa, and sat in the\r\nlower and upper houses for many years.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh assembly, which convened at Iowa City in May, 1845, sat\r\nWilliam Abbe in the council, and Joe K. Snyder and John Taylor in the\r\nhouse. William Abbe was the first actual settler in the county and one\r\nof the best known persons in eastern Iowa in early days. Mr. Abbe also\r\nsat in the assembly which met at Iowa City in December, 1845.\r\n\r\nLinn county was also represented by able men in the constitutional\r\nconventions, and no doubt the members from this county did much in the\r\nadoption of our constitution. In the first constitutional convention\r\nwhich convened October 7, 1844, there sat as members from this county\r\nthe following persons: T. J. McKean, L. M. Strong, and S. W. Durham,\r\nall democrats. This convention numbered fifty-three democrats and\r\nseventeen whigs. In the second constitutional convention, which met at\r\nthe seat of government May 4, 1856, Linn and Benton counties were\r\nrepresented by Socrates H. Tryon, of Marion. In this convention, which\r\nwas smaller than the first, the party vote stood twenty democrats and\r\nten whigs.\r\n\r\nIn the third constitutional convention, which met January 19, 1857,\r\nthere sat H. W. Gray, of Marion, as a member of the convention, and\r\nEllsworth N. Bates, of Cedar Rapids, as assistant secretary, a young\r\nman of brilliant parts.\r\n\r\nThe first governor of the newly made state, Ansel Briggs, was a\r\ndemocrat, as was Stephen Hempstead, his successor. James W. Grimes, who\r\nhad located at Burlington in 1836, was nominated for the office of\r\ngovernor at the whig convention in 1854, and made a memorable canvass.\r\nHis well known anti-slavery views rendered him acceptable to all who\r\nwere opposed to the extension of that institution. While many\r\nconservative whigs agreed with the democrats on the slavery issue,\r\nstill all classes who favored free soil united in the support of\r\nGrimes, who was favorably known and had been a member of the\r\nlegislature, and who had made a favorable impression upon the new\r\nsettlers who had come into the state to find homes. Grimes was elected,\r\nand this was the first defeat of the democrats since Iowa was organized\r\nas a territory.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1856, Governor Grimes wrote the call for the convention,\r\nwhich met at Iowa City on February 22d, which founded the republican\r\nparty. In this convention there sat a number of Linn county persons who\r\nlater became noted men in the party, and well known in the state.\r\n\r\nThe first presidential vote in Iowa was in the election in 1848, when\r\nCass, the regular democratic nominee, received 12,083 votes, Taylor,\r\nwhig, 11,084 votes, and Martin Van Buren, free soil democrat, 1,126\r\nvotes. In the election of 1852, which was quite exciting all over the\r\ncountry, and not least in Iowa, the popular votes for president were as\r\nfollows: Franklin Pierce, democrat, 17,763, Winfield Scott, whig,\r\n15,856, John P. Hale, free democracy, 1,704 votes. This vote would\r\nindicate that the democratic party still held the balance of power in\r\nthe state, but the change in old party lines was apparent.\r\n\r\nDuring the years up to 1856, a large number of pioneers had come into\r\nthe state from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Michigan, as well as\r\nfrom the New England states, and bitter party feeling ran high. Many of\r\nthe party leaders took the stump, and speeches were made in nearly all\r\nthese settlements. Newspapers were established and an active campaign\r\nbrought about. Politics was the topic of conversation at the country\r\nstore, at the grist-mill, and at the country postoffices, and everyone\r\nfelt that a change along party lines would be apparent. The vote in\r\nIowa for president in 1856 was: John C. Fremont, republican, 43,954,\r\nJames Buchanan, democrat, 36,170, Millard Fillmore, American party,\r\n9,180. James W. Grimes, the candidate for governor on the Fremont\r\nticket, was re-elected.\r\n\r\nIn this campaign the question of slavery was the main issue, and on\r\nthis ground the newly organized republican party carried the day in\r\nIowa. Iowa from this time was lost to the democrats, and they were\r\nunable to regain the lost ground by attempting to get away from the\r\nslavery issue. During the summer and fall of 1860 the campaign\r\nsurpassed even the excitable campaign of four years previous. At the\r\nfall election Lincoln received 70,409 votes, S. A. Douglas, democrat,\r\n55,111 votes, John Bell, 17,763 votes. J. C. Breckenridge, the regular\r\ndemocratic nominee, who aimed to carry slavery into the territory at\r\nany cost, received in this state only 1,048. The Douglas wing of the\r\nparty \"aimed to throw the responsibility of the slavery question upon\r\nthe supreme court or upon the territories, or anywhere else, except\r\nupon the democratic party.\" Douglas had many admirers in this county,\r\nand he visited, in this campaign, Marion and Cedar Rapids, where people\r\nflocked to hear him, many of whom admired him, but there were few who\r\ncould support his visionary schemes and many who doubted the outcome of\r\nhis dubious platform. This year the republican state ticket received on\r\nan average a plurality of 13,670 votes. In this election the state had\r\nbecome one of the solid republican states, and has so continued. In the\r\nstate campaign of 1861 S. J. Kirkwood carried the state in an exciting\r\ncampaign over William H. Merritt, the regular democratic nominee. Mr.\r\nMerritt had become a resident of this county, and hence received a\r\nlarge vote in his old home. Kirkwood had won over A. C. Dodge by a\r\nmajority of 3,000 two years before, and was a popular candidate, a man\r\nof many strong traits of character. The Civil war was on and the people\r\nfelt that they must sustain the policies of the party in power, and\r\nhence, perhaps, the popularity of the prospective candidates cut but\r\nlittle figure.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these campaigns as Perry Oxley and Ambrose Harlan were\r\nseated discussing politics at the county seat one day, Harlan in his\r\nwrath accused Oxley of being a traitor to the government. This was too\r\nmuch for the irate Kentucky-born democrat, and he knocked Harlan down\r\nwith a savage blow aimed at the fellow's head. There was a trial for\r\nassault and battery, to which Oxley pleaded guilty, and later Harlan\r\nbrought an action for damages in the district court, which damages were\r\npaid pro-rata by the democrats over the county. Col. I. M. Preston\r\ndefended Oxley and the outcome of the verdict in fact made the issues\r\nfor the next campaign.\r\n\r\nAt commencement exercises at Mt. Vernon a general free-for-all fight\r\noccurred on account of some girls wearing copperhead pins. This matter\r\nalso came into the courts, and county politics at least changed\r\nconditions, as party feelings ran high, and perhaps the ultimate\r\nmotives of party politics were lost sight of, in these hand to hand\r\ncontests waged near at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN CEDAR RAPIDS, 1910\r\n\r\nSt. Luke's Hospital\r\nSecurity Savings Bank\r\nMercy Hospital\r\nInterior Library\r\nMasonic Temple\r\nMasonic Library and Annex\r\nSecond Avenue Bridge\r\nHigh School\r\nPublic Library]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early days Joel Leverich was a prominent political character\r\nin Linn county. He was called the \"Bogus Coon,\" as it was claimed that\r\nhe belonged to a gang of counterfeiters. However true that may he, no\r\none knows, as he called himself a fellow who could make counterfeit\r\nmoney which would pass muster even in the land office. Leverich was a\r\nbright and intelligent person and wielded a great deal of influence as\r\na sort of ward heeler before wards were organized in an early day, and\r\nit was frequently stated \"that as Joel Leverich went, so went the\r\ncounty.\" Joel was not perhaps as interested in the political views of\r\nthe candidates as he was in getting pay for his services and in having\r\na promise of a pull with the officers if elected.\r\n\r\nBill Brody also wielded more or less influence in an early day in the\r\ncounty, and sometimes lined up with one party and sometimes with\r\nanother. It was generally true, that if Leverich and his followers were\r\nall on one side, Brody and his companions would generally be opposed,\r\nand it was very seldom that both gangs were enlisted to work for the\r\nsame political party in any one campaign.\r\n\r\nAt one time just preceding a county election, members of the two gangs\r\nmet at the Joshua Glover saloon in Marion. All had been drinking, and\r\nit was not long until the street was full of people, there being\r\nfifteen to twenty on a side all engaged in a general free-for-all\r\nfight. No one tried to interfere, and blood flowed freely. While Bill\r\nBrody was the leader and perhaps the most active, his chum and\r\nfollower, Barry Way, was the most powerful fighter, and is said to have\r\ncleaned out the entire gang and won the day. His political party was in\r\npower for a day at least.\r\n\r\nWhile there was much disorder, and trouble arose on account of lack of\r\nenforcement of law and order, it would be apparent that if men were\r\nelected to office by the assistance and help of men of this type it was\r\nnot surprising to hear that officials could not, or would not always\r\ncarry out the provisions of the law. Ambrose Harlan, well known in an\r\nearly day as a person who had nerve and considerable fight in him, came\r\nout as a candidate for sheriff on a platform all his own, claiming that\r\n\"he would catch horse thieves, and would even serve a warrant on Bill\r\nBrody himself, leader of the notorious gang,\" referred to in these\r\npages.\r\n\r\nHarlan became an imaginary hero in the eyes of the people, and was\r\nelected by a large majority. For a long time after he had assumed the\r\nduties of his office there did not seem to be anything doing in his\r\nparticular line. In fact the sheriff's office was the most deserted\r\nplace at the county seat. It resembled a summer resort in winter time,\r\nand Harlan was about to resign for want of anything to do, for if there\r\nwas anything Harlan loved it was a fight to a finish or a wordy contest\r\nwith a political opponent. As sheriff there was nothing to do in either\r\nline, for people seemed for once to mind their own business.\r\n\r\nAt last, one morning a warrant was brought to the sheriff to be served\r\non Brody, who had been charged with grand larceny of a team of horses.\r\nHarlan's moment had come, and he prided himself on the fact that he\r\nwould lodge Brody in jail before the next sun set. A few inquiries were\r\nmade, and Brody was located in the Way cabin, some five or six miles\r\neast of Vinton. At Vinton Harlan organized a posse and started early\r\nnext morning to catch the culprit before he would leave for the day.\r\n\r\nThey surrounded the cabin, Harlan fearing that the fellows had already\r\nescaped, but he ascertained that the smoke issuing from the cabin was\r\nonly an indication that Mrs. Way was getting breakfast ready. He found\r\nBill Brody and his chum Barry Way in bed. He was not long in making his\r\nerrand known, and Brody replied. \"Do you want me naked or will you give\r\nme time to put on my duds?\" To which Harlan replied that as it was\r\nstill early and he had all day, he would wait till the fellows dressed.\r\nThe men took considerable time in arranging their morning toilet,\r\nsaying to one another that it might be a long time before they would\r\nget back, and that the trial court could do nothing without their\r\npresence, so there was no hurry. Harlan sat on a home-made rickety\r\nchair in one corner of the room, with a gun in his left hand and a\r\nhickory stick in the other, watching the two culprits, and recalling\r\nthe old refrain, \"Weep no mo' me lady,\" as he watched the poor mother\r\nWay walking about the room with tears in her eyes, wondering what her\r\nwayward son had been up to this time. Harlan kept special watch on Way,\r\nwho was the athlete, not fearing Brody, who was a small person. As\r\nHarlan looked out at the tiny window to detect a certain noise he\r\nheard, Brody, nimble as a cat, was at his side in an instant. He wrung\r\nthe hickory sapling out of the sheriff's hands and struck him a savage\r\nblow on the head so that the Linn county official was \"dead to the\r\nworld\" for at least thirty minutes. The crowd outside were in hiding\r\nnear a straw stack, and when they saw the two desperadoes come out of\r\nthe cabin alone without any sheriff following, they took to their\r\nhorses and rode away as fast as they could, never looking around till\r\nthe town of Vinton was in sight.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheriff realized what had happened, he was invited to\r\nbreakfast by Mrs. Way, who said it might be a long time before her\r\nboarders would return. The sheriff would not accept the invitation, but\r\nasked instead for bandages for his head.\r\n\r\nHarlan was asked on his return to the county seat, minus his prisoner,\r\n\"Why didn't you take Bill when you had him?\" Harlan replied, \"How could\r\nI, when I had a gun in one hand and a hickory stick in the other, which\r\nhe took away and rapped me over the head with, and when I came to my\r\nsenses he wasn't there.\"\r\n\r\nIt was needless to say, that at the next election no one cared to enter\r\nthe race on a strictly horse thief catching platform.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable political contests ever waged in the county\r\nwas that of N. M. Hubbard and William Smythe for congress in 1868.\r\nHubbard had been a sort of political dictator since the organization of\r\nthe republican party. He had held the office of county judge for a\r\nshort time, and had been appointed attorney for the Northwestern\r\nrailway, and for this reason was a powerful factor in financial as well\r\nas in political circles. Hubbard was quarrelsome, impertinent, and\r\nout-spoken, and used to say, that he \"loved a nigger more than he did a\r\ndemocrat.\" In his aspirations for office he was backed by many friends\r\nand admirers, such as the Weares, Elys, Carrolls, and Higleys in Cedar\r\nRapids, and by most of the prominent Marion men, such as the Herveys,\r\nthe Daniels families, Captain Rathbun, Major Thompson, and Bob Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe people of Marion were bitter against Hubbard, especially R. D.\r\nStephens, who had been Hubbard's partner for some time, which\r\npartnership ended in a row, the last formal dissolution of the\r\npartnership being to the effect that Hubbard said to Stephens that \"he\r\nwould not attend his funeral,\" to which the partner replied, \"neither\r\nwill I attend yours or ever darken your threshhold in any capacity.\"\r\n\r\nStephens by this time was a financial factor in the county and had many\r\nfriends. It was thought that he should make the run against Hubbard,\r\nwho had removed to Cedar Rapids, but the leaders of this faction of the\r\nparty thought that a candidate must be selected who had been in the\r\nwar, and thus the opponents of Hubbard selected William Smythe, who was\r\na brother-in-law of Stephens, as the logical candidate to make the\r\nrace. Smythe was an Irishman who had been an officer in the Civil war;\r\nwas an eminent lawyer, a most affable gentleman, who had made a\r\nreputation for himself as a conservative and safe political leader.\r\n\r\nIn this canvass Smythe was also backed by Robert Smythe, an older\r\nbrother, who had been in the legislature, and was favorably known\r\nthroughout the county. Stephens was the financial backer and the\r\norganizer of the Smythe faction. He was far-sighted, wielded\r\nconsiderable political and social influence, and used his money freely\r\nin this campaign to get even with Hubbard, if for no other reason. In\r\nthis fight Stephens enlisted the service of a number of prominent\r\ndemocrats who were unfriendly to Hubbard. Everyone expected that\r\nHubbard would win hands down, and carry Cedar Rapids and many of the\r\ncounty precincts. Smythe enlisted in his cause such men as Colonel\r\nPreston, Dr. Thos. Bardwell, J. H. Preston, S. W. Durham, James Brown,\r\nand many other democrats who were on the inside of this movement to\r\ndethrone the republican county boss. Smythe carried Marion township\r\nmuch to the surprise of the local leaders who had thought up to that\r\ntime that everything was cocked and primed for Hubbard.\r\n\r\nThe county went about half and half; both parties, of course, had\r\nexpected a small majority. When the officers were selected and a\r\ncontest came up to a show of hands, the convention stood a tie. The old\r\ncourt house was filled to overflowing, and many wordy contests took\r\nplace outside as well as inside of the old dingy court room.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon passed and neither side got ahead. Stephens was the\r\nactive leader on the floor of the convention and knew more about\r\nparliamentary rules than anyone else. Still there were others in the\r\nconvention on the Hubbard side who were no novices at the business of\r\npacking a convention.\r\n\r\nAn agreement had been made that the winner should select his own\r\ndelegates, and it was conceded that whoever carried the county would\r\ncarry the district. Neither faction dared to adjourn, and so the fight\r\nwas kept up on motions of one kind and another with voting now and then\r\nto ascertain if the members had changed. They all \"stood pat,\" and it\r\nhas since been suggested that this must have been the first time the\r\nword standpatter was used in a political sense.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Dr. Thomas S. Bardwell moved about in the convention\r\nhall shaking hands with his professional brethren and others. He\r\ninvited a stanch supporter of Hubbard from up the county, and a\r\nprofessional brother, into his postoffice and into a back room where he\r\nlived. They got into conversation and Bardwell knew that the man wanted\r\na little for his stomach's sake, for he had traveled a long ways that\r\nmorning and had had nothing to eat all day. Bardwell fully agreed with\r\nthe country doctor that the air of a dingy court room was bad for the\r\nlungs, and that a life of that kind would certainly ruin the health of\r\nany man, however strong he might otherwise he. The country doctor took\r\none and then another drink from the city man's private supply, and the\r\nMarion man was not one of the kind that refused even to take a drink\r\nwith his country friend. The conversation moved much easier and more\r\npleasant after the first few drinks, and Bardwell, to show that he was\r\na good fellow, brought out a variety of liquor, such as would have made\r\nthe mouth of a true Kentuckian smack in anticipation. It was not long\r\ntill the country practitioner forgot all about the convention and was\r\n\"dead to the world.\" He was placed in the doctor's bed, the doors\r\nlocked, and Bardwell hurried back to the court house, sending a note to\r\nStephens to the effect that he must put the vote at once. Stephens did\r\nnot know whether Bardwell was putting up a scheme on him or not, but he\r\nwas about at the end with his objections and thought he would try just\r\nanother vote and risk everything on a democrat's advice. Stephens\r\nwithdrew his motion then pending and called for a vote by ballot. The\r\nHubbard faction was glad of this opportunity, and as there were no\r\nobjections the seesaw affair of balloting once more began.\r\n\r\nWhen the votes were counted it was found that the Hubbard faction was\r\none short. They counted and re-counted, and made the air blue with dire\r\nthreats, wondering who had sold out, but no \"Judas\" could be found.\r\nFinally it was discovered that the country delegate aforesaid was\r\nmissing. It was thought that he had gone home or had been called away\r\non professional business, but such was not the case. The aforesaid\r\ncountry delegate was not made aware of the real condition of things\r\ntill the next morning when he awoke in the back room of the doctor's\r\noffice wondering how he had gotten such fine quarters without any\r\nassistance from either side, as far as he knew.\r\n\r\nThe convention went wild over Smythe's victory and the city of Marion,\r\nregardless of party, was caught in this wave of enthusiasm, and the\r\nonly topic of conversation for a long time afterwards was \"how William\r\nSmythe won the fight.\"\r\n\r\nThe newspaper which gave the best write-up of this political contest,\r\nand the paper which did more for Smythe than any other political organ\r\nin the county, was the _Linn County Signal_, edited by a nephew of S.\r\nW. Durham, by the name of Williams. The editorial writers, however,\r\nwere such men as Dr. Thos. Bardwell, James Brown, S. W. Durham, Colonel\r\nI. M. Preston, and Judge J. H. Preston, who was just then beginning to\r\nlearn the inside workings of politics. A tramp printer by the name of\r\nTompkins came along some time before the convention occurred, out of\r\nmoney and out of work, and was employed on the paper. Tompkins looked\r\nand acted like a fool, but was in fact a genius. He could write better\r\nthan the best of them, and knew shorthand as well. He reported the\r\nproceedings of this unique convention, and it is stated by all,\r\nregardless of party affiliations, that this write-up was the best of\r\nany political write-up of any convention before or since.\r\n\r\nAfter Smythe had been duly nominated for congress, the democrats of\r\nLinn county refused to support the republican candidate any longer, as\r\nthey were only acting in the capacity of beating Hubbard. William E.\r\nLeffingwell, of Clinton, one of the silver-tongued orators of the west\r\nand an eminent man in many ways, was selected as the standard bearer of\r\nthe democratic party to oppose Smythe. As Hubbard and his friends\r\nknifed Smythe on account of the action taken by Smythe's followers in\r\nthe county convention, there was hope that a democrat might be elected.\r\nThe county democrats challenged Smythe to a joint debate, hoping that\r\nhe would refuse to debate with a person much his superior. But Smythe\r\naccepted the challenge and it was decided that there should be three\r\njoint debates in the county, at Center Point, Marion, and Cedar Rapids.\r\nThe first joint debate was to be held at Center Point--a democratic\r\nstronghold--and Smythe and his followers drove over from Marion in\r\nlarge numbers, for they wanted to protect their candidate in case any\r\ntrouble should arise. Leffingwell and his party also started from\r\nMarion, made up of the most influential democrats in Cedar Rapids and\r\nMarion. Dr. Bardwell, one of the leaders of the democracy, and who had\r\nlaid out the Hubbard supporter at the time of the convention, sat in\r\nthe back seat of the buggy with Leffingwell and carried the same kind\r\nof wet goods along on this evening and for the same purpose that the\r\ncandidate should take something for his stomach's sake. This time\r\nBardwell was in earnest and really wanted to instill into the candidate\r\na little of the spirit which would brace him up to a greater effort. He\r\ndid not figure that Leffingwell's only fault was his love for the\r\nbottle. When they arrived at Center Point more liquor was added, and\r\nwhen Leffingwell sat in the stuffy room listening to Smythe's opening\r\narguments half an hour, the liquor took effect, and he became so drunk\r\nthat he could hardly stand up, and made a rambling sort of a speech as\r\nonly one under the influence of liquor could make. Smythe replied to\r\nthe rambling remarks of his opponent in a most masterly way and in such\r\na telling manner that even the democrats got disgusted with their own\r\ncandidate, and the Marion contingent felt that hanging would have been\r\ntoo good for Doc Bardwell.\r\n\r\nThis first meeting ended the joint debates with Leffingwell. Later in\r\nthe fall the democrats secured another debater from southern Iowa in\r\nthe person of Martin Van Buren Bennett, a rabid partisan and a fiery\r\norator, who, perhaps, surpassed Smythe in oratory, but who failed to\r\nmake any special gains for his party as he was an outsider who dwelt on\r\npast history and did not confine himself to present conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRDSEYE VIEW OF CEDAR RAPIDS IN 1868]\r\n\r\nThe friends of Smythe were very active among the democrats within the\r\ncounty to obtain their support, knowing that a large number of\r\nrepublicans would bolt the ticket. It was told that a fellow democrat\r\nwent to old man Hickey in College township, an old Irishman and a\r\nstanch democrat, wanting him to vote for Smythe on the strength that he\r\nwas born in Ireland. Hickey replied, \"What! ask me to vote for an\r\nOrangeman, let me tell ye, when an Irishman steals a pig he gives half\r\nof it to the priest; when an Orangeman steals a pig he takes the whole\r\nd--thing and gives the priest nathing. No, I'll vote for no Orangeman\r\nfor any office, I tell ye.\"\r\n\r\nSmythe was elected by a large majority and served until his death in\r\n1870. Judge Smythe was one of the ablest men in the county; he had been\r\na delegate to the convention that nominated Lincoln for president, and\r\nin 1861 was appointed to negotiate a bond issued by the state to\r\nprovide a war defense fund. He was also a colonel in the 31st Iowa\r\nInfantry, and served in the field until December, 1864. Had he lived no\r\ndoubt he would have been one of the United States senators from Iowa,\r\nand might have had the coveted place so long occupied by James Harlan\r\nand William B. Allison.\r\n\r\nIn the Greeley contest there was not very much activity in politics in\r\nthe county, although a number who had previously affiliated with the\r\ndemocratic party joined the republican ranks. The Blaine campaign was\r\none of the most bitter campaigns waged pro and con in the county. In\r\nthis campaign Milo P. Smith, of Linn, was the republican candidate for\r\ncongress against Ben Frederick, democrat, of Marshall county, who won\r\nout against Smith on account of wrangling within the republican ranks.\r\n\r\nJohn T. Hamilton, in another exciting contest for congress, won out as\r\na democrat against Geo. R. Struble, of Tama county, in 1890. Mr.\r\nHamilton had served in the legislature for six years previously and had\r\ndemonstrated his ability as an able and conservative legislator. He had\r\nmany stanch supporters in the district and especially in Linn county,\r\nhis home. Mr. Hamilton was defeated for re-election in 1892 by Robert\r\nG. Cousins, of Cedar county, who held the seat continually till he was\r\nsucceeded by James W. Good, of Linn county, in the election of 1908.\r\nMr. Good was re-elected in the fall of 1910.\r\n\r\nThis article was not intended to deal with present politics, but with\r\npast politics, and so the various contests which have been waged since\r\nthe Bryan campaign of 1896 will be left for other historians to\r\nchronicle. The politicians of an early day in Linn county were men of\r\nforce and ability, who were interested in the material welfare of the\r\npeople of the state. These men always took a leading part in every\r\npolitical and financial issue which arose, abhoring mere party\r\ndifferences brought about for personal objects by selfish persons. Both\r\nthe leading parties possessed efficient leaders, who were fully\r\ncompetent to cope with the issues under consideration from time to\r\ntime. These political leaders were efficient stump speakers, strong\r\npolitical writers, financial backers and promoters of railroads and\r\nsteamboat lines. Their knowledge of the affairs of county and state\r\npolitics was unsurpassed, and as mere orators they held large\r\ngatherings spellbound by their magnetic influence.\r\n\r\nThe politician of the old school was always a gentleman and would\r\nseldom descend to anything low or unprofessional in order to obtain a\r\npolitical victory over another. The instances cited in those pages are\r\nonly the occasional outbreak of party strife, or of selfish desire for\r\nvengeance to satisfy some wrong, real or imaginary. Many of the party\r\nleaders in the county in ye olden times, regardless of party\r\naffiliations, were men of culture and education, conservative men,\r\nkeen, shrewd, and capable, who battled manfully, loyally, and\r\ntruthfully for the young state in its trying days in the beginning.\r\nNothing is more instructive than to read the early laws which were\r\npassed and to meditate over the proceedings as found of three memorable\r\nconstitutional conventions. These deliberations show the good sense of\r\nthose who took part in debates, and while the discussions took a wide\r\nrange, the members never lost sight of the constitutional limitations\r\nand of the legal status of the state to the federal government.\r\n\r\nSuch men as Abbe, the Smythe brothers, E. N. Bates, Durham, Col.\r\nPreston, Judge Isbell, Strong, Gray, Kurtz, Col. Butler, Chandler\r\nJordan, Squire Nugent, Squire Ure, Isaac Cook, Col. W. H. Merritt,\r\nJudge George Greene, Major M. A. Higley, and scores of other well known\r\npioneers were an honor to any community and in their respective\r\ncapacities wielded much influence in the county during the pioneer\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FATHER SVRDLIK, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n_Cedar Rapids_\r\n\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids is not a new town. True, it has not been flourishing for\r\ncenturies, like the old European cities, with histories which reach\r\nback several centuries, but as cities and towns in the middle west are\r\nspoken of, it has a lengthy history and one of more or less interest.\r\nYoung as it is, Cedar Rapids has no definite chronicle as to who was\r\nthe first actual settler. Dyer Usher claimed that he and a companion\r\ngazed upon the beauty of its banks and admired the river at the upper\r\nfalls as early as 1836. Osgood Shepherd maintained that he was the\r\nfirst actual settler, and that he opened a tavern here in 1837 or 1838.\r\nHe, at least, sold his squatter right in the embryo town, and made the\r\nfirst property deal involving landed rights in what later became the\r\ncity. J. Wilbert Stone, also known as Bill Stone and William Stone, was\r\nhere as early as any white man. He was born in the state of Rhode\r\nIsland about 1803, and emigrated to Iowa Territory in the early\r\nthirties. Stone was a well educated, quiet, and refined man, who\r\npossessed all the traits of a trader. He drifted into Davenport and\r\nRock Island, and came to Westport some time after William Abbe. No\r\ndoubt he came from Rockingham up along the river looking for a place to\r\nbarter with Indians, and the few white men who might come along as\r\nhunters and trappers. He conducted a small trading post at Westport\r\nsome time in 1837, but whether he was the first storekeeper in the\r\ncounty is not known, as this honor has also been accorded to John\r\nHenry. Whether Henry bought Stone out or not is not certain, but this\r\nis true, that Stone disposed of his interests and removed ten miles by\r\ntrail up to the lower rapids, at the bend in the Red Cedar river, where\r\nthe large packing plant of the T. M. Sinclair Company now stands, and\r\nhere laid out a squatter town, which he called Columbus. This town site\r\nis supposed to have been staked out on the east side of the river. The\r\ntime must have been in 1837. He quarreled with Shepherd, who either\r\ncame about the same time, or closely followed Stone. Stone, being a\r\nquiet, peaceable person, still single, was compelled to cross the river\r\nand take up a claim on the west side. Robert Ellis asserts that he\r\nfound the first small hut on May 8, 1838, on what became Cedar Rapids,\r\nand that it was located on the east side near the packing plant, and\r\nwas occupied by Philip Hull. Had Shepherd sold this cabin to Hull after\r\nhaving driven Stone across the river? That might be probable, as\r\nShepherd tried the same dodge on Ellis a few months later when he was\r\nbuilding a cabin on his claim on the west side of the river. In that\r\ninstance Shepherd had a prospective purchaser who was willing to go\r\ninto Ellis's shack, and but for the nerve and presence of mind of\r\nEllis, Shepherd might have succeeded. From Stone's daughter, still\r\nliving, it would seem that Stone was the first actual settler who came\r\nhere to trade with the Indians, and the first to lay out the squatter\r\ntown which later became Cedar Rapids, and that this plat or staking out\r\nwas on the east and not the west side of the river, all of which would\r\nbe natural as all the other squatter towns had been staked on the east\r\nside, and thus were better defended from an attack of Indians or border\r\nruffians, who were apt to congregate more frequently on the west side\r\nof the stream.\r\n\r\nRobert Ellis walked into the town and found Hull, and later Shepherd,\r\nlocated in a small cabin, which he called a tavern situated on the\r\nriver bank on what is now First avenue. Mr. Ellis also found at this\r\ntime John Young, a Scotchman, Granger, Fisher, and another Scot by the\r\nname of Galloway. Shepherd laid claim at that time to nearly all of the\r\nland on the east side of the river and especially the land adjoining\r\nthe dam site and the slough now called Cedar lake. A few hunters and\r\ntrappers came now and then and remained at the Shepherd cabin for days\r\nat a time and then would depart as quietly as they had entered the\r\ncrude hotel on the river bank. It has been reported that Shepherd\r\nharbored border ruffians and it has been said of him that while \"he did\r\nnot willingly steal, he had not scruples about harboring those who\r\nsubsisted from that kind of traffic.\" So far as authentic records\r\nindicate, we have no written or reliable sources of information except\r\nhearsay, till Robert Ellis walked up the river and found the cabins of\r\nHull and Shepherd on the east side of the river, which property rights\r\nwere claimed by these parties as squatter owners. By this time Stone\r\nhad removed to the west side of the river and had already erected a\r\ncabin. Being a single man he was not at home at all times, and thus\r\nmight have been away at the time Ellis arrived. Ellis soon discovered\r\nfrom what Shepherd said as well as from what Stone had intimated, that\r\nthese men were at outs, and the best way to keep peace was to have the\r\nriver between them. Ellis had been out in the world long enough not to\r\nmix in the quarrels of other men and to keep as close-mouthed as\r\npossible about the troubles between sworn enemies. They never\r\nassociated after their quarrel. The daughter of Stone claims that her\r\nfather told her many times that the reason he sold out and removed to\r\nthe Iowa river bottom was on account of Shepherd's attitude and that of\r\nthe members of his gang toward him. These men feared that Stone would\r\ninform on them and wanted him out of the way so long as he refused to\r\nbecome an associate of theirs or in any way to approve of their\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nIt would seem plausible that in a community where so many were law\r\nviolators and enemies of law and order a man like Stone would not be\r\ntolerated and the ruffians would do all in their power to get him out\r\nof the way by intimidation or otherwise.\r\n\r\nN. B. Brown, from what we have been informed by N. E. Brown and others,\r\nmust have passed through what became Cedar Rapids as early as 1839 but\r\nhe did not locate here till the following year, when he first realized\r\nthe full value of the falls and the feasibility of a plan to erect a\r\nsuitable dam across the river which would furnish power to run saw and\r\ngrist mills. Galloway, Young, Granger, O. S. Bowling, and a few others\r\nwere here in the meantime, all holding down claims, but no one thought\r\nof any future city to be founded or of any valuable asset in the water\r\npower which had never been harnessed to machinery. What appealed to\r\nthem was the fact that the stream could be forded at this place, that\r\nthe banks had plenty of timber, and that it was a sort of way station\r\nfor straggling Indian trappers and hunters. Mr. Brown was not a\r\nfrontiersman but a mechanic, who was a trained miller and looked into\r\nthe future and saw that the location was ideal. While he had but little\r\nmoney, he could see far enough ahead that here would be the logical\r\npoint for mills. Mr. Brown interested George Greene, H. W. Gray, A. L.\r\nRoach, and S. H. Tryon, and they purchased from Osgood Shepherd an\r\nundivided three-fourths interest for $3,000. The other one-fourth\r\ninterest was later sold by Shepherd to J. E. Sanford and Addison\r\nDaniels. Mr. Shepherd had nothing but a squatter claim to sell, but\r\nBrown and the others figured that it would be cheaper to buy him out\r\nthan to make a fight on him, and so the bargain was made. From an old\r\naccount book still in the possession of N. E. Brown, we cite the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     \"August 4, 1841. Commenced surveying 'Rapids City.' August 7,\r\n     2-1/2 days by N. B. Brown, same, S. Durham, same, J. W.\r\n     Carson, 1-1/2 days Geo. Greene, same, A. Daniels, 2-1/2 days\r\n     O. Shepherd.\"\r\n\r\nThis proves that after the squatter right was purchased from Shepherd,\r\nand the embryo town was first named by Brown the actual work of\r\nsurveying was commenced in August, 1841. All of the above named\r\npersons became later well known in the county. Greene and Tryon were\r\nclerks of court about this time, Durham was the newly arrived surveyor,\r\nwhile Daniels became a merchant and prominent business man. Sanford was\r\nan attorney and the owner of much land in this county, but died early\r\nleaving his estate to his widow and aged father, who resided in\r\nConnecticut. It would seem that Cedar Rapids was first called Columbus,\r\nnext Rapids City, and finally Cedar Rapids, taking its name from the\r\nname of the river and the rapids which are formed here by the rock\r\nfoundations in the river bed.\r\n\r\nShepherd lingered around the place till the next year, when he found\r\nthat there was nothing further in his line, and that he was not\r\ninterested in corner lots or in any enterprises such as appealed to\r\nBrown, David King, Greene, Sanford, Daniels, and many others. He\r\ndisposed of all his remaining rights and left for Wisconsin with his\r\nfamily. He was later killed in a railway accident.\r\n\r\nJohn Young also disposed of his squatter rights to Dr. J. R. Richey and\r\nJ. W. Carson. These purchasers sold again to Brown the following year.\r\n\r\nJ. L. Enos, a newspaper man, has the following to say of Shepherd,\r\nwriting in 1866: \"The crimes committed by Shepherd and his gang were\r\nfor years a constant annoyance. John Young and a man by the name of\r\nGranger were his immediate companions. The islands in the river,\r\nparticularly the one above the dam, were used as places to conceal\r\ntheir plunder. A great many horses and much other property were stolen\r\nby them, and in many cases they succeeded in hiding their booty. It is\r\nknown that this gang stole at one time six horses, getting away with\r\nfour of them. Granger was later caught in Chicago and tried for passing\r\ncounterfeit money. He was sent to the Alton prison for four years.\r\nYoung, it is stated on reliable authority, was executed in a\r\nneighboring state, having been convicted of murder.\"\r\n\r\nTo prove that there is more or less truth in the stories as written of\r\nShepherd by Enos, Mr. Ellis says that shortly after he had located on\r\nhis claim and while he was building a cabin so as to hold his land,\r\nShepherd and some stranger came along one day and Shepherd insisted\r\nthat this was his claim and that Ellis should vacate as soon as he\r\ncould, as there would be trouble in store for a newcomer who had the\r\ncheek to jump a claim of this kind. Ellis was much surprised and could\r\nnot believe that Shepherd, with whom he had stayed for a short time,\r\nwould come at him with such unfounded accusations. He had heard of the\r\ntrouble with Stone and knew from Hull that Shepherd was not a very good\r\nman. Hull seemed to be all right. Ellis made up his mind that in a game\r\nof bluff he would not take a back seat, and that he had not come all\r\nthe way from Pennsylvania on foot for nothing. He got mad and then did\r\nnot stop to count noses, but raised his ax and came towards Shepherd,\r\nsaying in his most emphatic way that the claim was his and that some\r\none would get killed before he gave it up. He said he had picked out\r\nand improved the land and by right owned it till such time as the\r\ngovernment saw fit to throw it open for settlement. He then accused\r\nShepherd of some of the things he had heard and offered to back it up\r\nby proof if he wanted it. He said further, \"You have bluffed others out\r\nof their claims, but you can't bluff me. You get off my land or I shall\r\nbe compelled to use my ax.\" Shepherd moved away and the stranger turned\r\npale and was uncertain whether he should run or stand there with his\r\nhands raised. He had never been in such a place before. Never again was\r\nEllis molested, nor did Shepherd again refer to the unpleasant\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nIt was later rumored that Shepherd for a consideration was to locate\r\nthe stranger on a good claim. He figured that as Ellis had already a\r\ncabin partially built this would be a good chance to get a bit of money\r\nand he reasoned that a stranger in the country would soon give in. He\r\nhad not figured on the fact that Ellis was \"the bravest of the brave,\"\r\nwhen it came to a question of asserting his own rights, which he knew\r\nwere just. From this little episode as to the character of Shepherd as\r\ndisplayed toward Ellis it would seem that Shepherd might have gone at\r\nStone in the same manner in which he tried to treat Ellis, and by force\r\nand intimidation made him give up his claim. Shepherd's course while a\r\ncitizen of Linn county was not an honorable one and few, if any, of his\r\nassociates speak of him except in an unfavorable light.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1839, arrived Joe and John Listebarger, who erected a small\r\nlog house at what is now 818 North First street west and owned by\r\nFerdinand Uebel. A younger brother, Isaac, arrived later the same\r\nsummer. William Knowles erected a house on what later became known as\r\nMound Farm. John Stambaugh built a log house in what is now Bever Park,\r\nwhich later was disposed of to John G. Cole. The upper part of the west\r\nside was settled by Farnham Colby, who came shortly after Ellis had\r\nstaked out his holdings. During the years 1838-39 came others, such as\r\nThos. Gainor, Joel and James Leverich, P. W. Earle, and many others. It\r\nwas in July of this year that the family of Isaac Carroll arrived and\r\nlocated a little to the east of what is now Cedar Rapids. A son of\r\nIsaac Carroll, the Rev. George R. Carroll, writes as follows in his\r\n_Pioneer Life_: \"I cannot now recall anything of importance on the way\r\nuntil we reached Linn Grove, where we found a few log cabins. In\r\nconversation with one of the women who occupied one of these primitive\r\nabodes we found that her language was so different from anything we had\r\nheard, that it left a decided impression on our minds and was a source\r\nof no little amusement to us children. Some of her peculiar expressions\r\nwere by-words with us for many years. She seemed very cordial and ready\r\nas everybody was in welcoming newcomers, and she was quite\r\ncommunicative, although her accounts were not always of the most\r\nencouraging and inspiring character to the new arrivals.\r\n\r\n     \"It was in the afternoon of July 4th, 1839, when we reached\r\n     the county seat and the only thing to mark the spot was a\r\n     bower of bushes under which our nation's birthday had been\r\n     celebrated in primitive style and in which, judging from\r\n     hilarious demonstrations of two or three men that we met on\r\n     the way, whiskey must have played a somewhat conspicuous\r\n     part. A little at one side of the town L. M. Strong had a\r\n     little cabin. I do not remember of having seen either the\r\n     cabin or the tenants at the time but Mr. Strong was for many\r\n     years after a well known and highly honored citizen of this\r\n     place. Passing on beyond Marion we crossed Indian creek about\r\n     a mile north of the present crossings and where there was a\r\n     beautiful crystal spring, near which was a little cabin\r\n     occupied by Mr. James W. Bassett. From this point, turning in\r\n     a southwesterly direction, we found our way by a dim track\r\n     through the woods reaching, towards night, the little bark\r\n     shanty of Ephraim T. Lewis, near where now stands the stone\r\n     barn just south of the boulevard two miles west of Marion.\r\n     Mr. Lewis and his son-in-law, Nathaniel G. Niece, were there\r\n     and gave us a most hearty welcome and most cordial invitation\r\n     to share their hospitality over night, which we gladly\r\n     accepted.\r\n\r\n     \"The next day we passed a half mile west to the little hut of\r\n     Mr. Jewell, later occupied by Barnet Lutz. Passing on sixty\r\n     or eighty rods west of Mr. Jewell's through the tall grass we\r\n     found Mr. A. B. Mason breaking up prairie on the higher\r\n     ground just north of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul\r\n     Railway at a point forty or fifty rods west of the boulevard\r\n     crossing at Kenwood. This, I think, was the first furrow\r\n     plowed between Marion and Cedar Rapids. Passing Mr. Mason, we\r\n     found ourselves in a few moments on the ground which was to\r\n     be our future home. At a point of the ridge near the mound,\r\n     which in later years has been extensively known as Judge\r\n     Greene's Mound Farm, we pitched our tent, the little brook\r\n     near by affording us water, and the grove close at hand\r\n     furnishing wood and poles and bushes for the erection of a\r\n     bower, which for a few days were to serve us as a kitchen and\r\n     dining room.\"\r\n\r\nIn this company came also B. F. and C. C. Cook, step-sons of Isaac\r\nCarroll, and Sarah Carroll, a step-daughter. There were also the\r\nfollowing children: Isaac W., George R., and Julia Carroll.\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll, in his interesting recollections of pioneer days, speaks\r\nof a number of people who at this time and in the next few years\r\nresided in and around Cedar Rapids, such as William Vineyard, who\r\nmarried Sarah Carroll, and various members of the Lewis family, who\r\narrived that same fall. James Ferguson and his family, the Weare\r\nfamily, William Stewart, A. Sines, Arvin Kennedy, Isaac and William\r\nCook, members of the Ely families, Dr. J. W. Traer, J. F. Charles, the\r\nDaniels families, and many others came a little later.\r\n\r\nThus within a few years from the time that Brown and others purchased\r\nthe claims of Shepherd, the scene along the banks of the Red Cedar had\r\nchanged from an Indian wilderness and a resort of border ruffians to a\r\nlandscape bearing all the evidences of a high degree of civilization.\r\nThe old Indian burial grounds became the place of a Christian cemetery,\r\nand the pole tepees covered with leaves and skins were removed to make\r\nplace for commodious log houses, erected by the whites.\r\n\r\nIn a study of the beginnings in Cedar Rapids it has seemed to the\r\nwriter that heretofore due amount of credit for his work has not been\r\ngiven to N. B. Brown. His was indeed a constructive genius. He early\r\ninterested himself in and in many instances began businesses that gave\r\nemployment to labor, the backbone of any thrifty community. His\r\nenterprises were not always successful ones, whose are? All of them,\r\nhowever, were busy institutions for a time, and while they were going\r\nthey gave employment to many people. It seemed to be the rule to send\r\nstrangers in the city seeking employment to Nick Brown if no one else\r\nhad use for their services, they being told that Mr. Brown was sure to\r\ngive them something to do.\r\n\r\nAnd he always did as it was intimated he would do.\r\n\r\nHis manufacturing industries were many and varied. He built and\r\noperated saw and flour mills, woollen and knitting factories, at one\r\ntime conducting two saw mills in the city, one on each side of the\r\nCedar. He also at one time ran a saw mill on Indian Creek, south of\r\ntown. He built a starch factory at McCloud's Run, and when this failed\r\nowing to the dismissal by his foreman of the only man who knew the\r\nsecrets of the manufacture he converted the mill into a distillery,\r\nthus making a market for the corn raised in the county.\r\n\r\nSome of his early account books are now in the possession of his son,\r\nN. E. Brown. They show page after page of names of employes in his\r\nvarious manufacturing enterprises.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible at this date to give a proper estimate to the\r\nvalue of his services to the infant city. Pioneers of the energy and\r\npublic spirit manifested by Mr. Brown were indeed of great benefit to\r\nthe community in which they wrought, and honor and credit ought to be\r\nextended accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe are glad here to testify to the great worth of Mr. Brown along\r\nindustrial lines in the pioneer days of our beautiful and prosperous\r\nCedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nFor the first few years the settlers got along as best they could. They\r\nhad few if any luxuries. Dubuque and Muscatine were the nearest\r\nmarkets. It required from six to fourteen days to make the trip and\r\nfrequently longer when the roads were bad and when fierce storms\r\novertook the party. Robert Ellis built three flat boats in the winter\r\nof 1841 and took a cargo of wheat to Burlington, trading this for a\r\ncargo of flour which he delivered safely at New Orleans, in July of\r\nthat year. He got back during the summer but did not make any money out\r\nof the enterprise and never again cared to try the experiment. Many\r\nyears later he received a settlement with the Burlington firm which was\r\nhard pressed for money and could not pay for the 4,000 bushels he had\r\ndelivered. So while he did not get a fortune he perhaps came out even\r\non this hazardous trip.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true this daring enterprise failed to make Robert Ellis a\r\nwealthy man it did stir people up to the possibility of river traffic\r\nand that of course helped. The venture was talked over and over time\r\nand again, flat boats were built now and then, and a little grain\r\nshipped. Small steamers made Cedar Rapids in the early spring of the\r\nyear, bringing a few groceries and notions, and taking away wheat,\r\noats, pork, and a little corn.\r\n\r\nArtificial dams in the river were talked of but that was as far as it\r\nwent. No one was able to have any pull with the legislatures. Robert\r\nHolmes, an old Marion resident, had a grain house at Ivanhoe, and took\r\ncargoes of grain down the river in 1844, '46 and '51; Henry Thomson\r\nalso ran a few flat boats on the river as far as St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 a body of enterprising young men had built the steamer \"Cedar\r\nRapids\" at Beaver, Pennsylvania, at a cost of $20,000, the stockholders\r\nbeing Wm. and George Greene, J. F. Ely, H. G. Angle, L. Daniels & Co.,\r\nand W. W. Smith. This steamer ran during much of the spring and summer\r\nand late into the fall, and did a big business. But within two years in\r\nan accident on the Mississippi river the \"Cedar Rapids\" ran into\r\nanother steamer, litigation ensued, and the owners lost everything they\r\nhad made as well as the steamer.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first big adventure of the Cedar Rapids spirit. In the\r\nsame year another steamer, the \"Black Hawk,\" was built to run up the\r\nriver to Waterloo and for a time did fair business. This was owned by\r\nW. D. Watrous, J. J. Snouffer, W. W. Smith, J. Stanley, and several\r\nothers. This steamboat was sold to the government during the war and\r\nused as a supply steamer on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. At one\r\ntime N. B. Brown was the owner of the boat. Just as the people were\r\ndemanding that another company be formed to invest in another steamer\r\nenterprise the railways came, and now these daring business men\r\ncentered their efforts in developing railroads and won out, but not\r\nuntil after many struggles, and after many failures. The people of Linn\r\ncounty surveyed, planned, and talked about several lines before they\r\ncould realize the benefits of any.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railway was organized in what is now\r\nClinton on January 26, 1856, the first officers being Charles Walker,\r\nof Chicago, president, James Purdy, of Mansfield, Ohio, vice president,\r\nT. T. Davis, of Syracuse, New York, treasurer, R. H. Norton, secretary,\r\nand Milo Smith, of Clinton county, engineer. Many Cedar Rapids\r\nresidents put up money and notes to have the road come through the\r\ncity. Most of the necessary means were put up by eastern capitalists\r\nand especially by John I. Blair, one of the most enterprising of the\r\nearly railroad promoters in America. Mr. Blair was born in New Jersey\r\nin 1802 and passed away in 1892, one of the most noted men of this\r\ncountry. He was at least in an early day the owner of more miles of\r\nrailways than any other man in the world, and had laid out more town\r\nsites and villages in Iowa and Nebraska than any other person in the\r\nwest. It was John I. Blair who first saw the opportunity of making\r\nCedar Rapids a center on account of its progressive people, the water\r\npower, and other advantages which this practical, wide-awake railway\r\nman saw here, and which were lacking in other localities. In June,\r\n1859, the road was completed to Cedar Rapids. Its coming was the most\r\nimportant event in the history of the city. It was the beginning of the\r\nend in the unique struggle for railways in Linn county, and marks an\r\nepoch in the history of the city.\r\n\r\nThe road was extended west, and by 1862 the trains were running as far\r\nas Marshalltown. By 1867 the road was completed to the Missouri river.\r\nBoth the Iowa and Nebraska and the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River\r\nrailways have for many years been under one management and are now\r\nknown as the Chicago and Northwestern Railway, which owns and operates\r\nnearly 8,000 miles of road with a capital stock of $130,121,838.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRDSEYE VIEW Of CEDAR RAPIDS IN 1889]\r\n\r\nIn 1865 D. W. C. Rowley began grading for the Burlington, Cedar Rapids\r\nand Northern Railway, which was organized in Cedar Rapids. A separate\r\ncompany, known as the Cedar Valley Construction Company, was organized\r\nto build this line to Waterloo. This company was composed of such men\r\nas Dr. J. F. Ely, president, William Greene, superintendent, D. W. C.\r\nRowley, secretary. In December, 1866, another road was incorporated,\r\nrunning to Burlington south via Iowa City. The men connected with this\r\nenterprise were J. H. Gear, Burlington, president, J. E. Putnam,\r\nBurlington, secretary, directors Dr. S. D. Carpenter, of Cedar Rapids,\r\nE. Clark and Peter A. Dey, of Iowa City, and John Bird, Louisa county.\r\n\r\nThis southern branch did not progress rapidly and there was more or\r\nless of a hitch with the plans, and a question as to how the road\r\nshould run. The articles were changed, leaving out Iowa City, and the\r\nboard increased to fifteen members, among whom may be mentioned N. B.\r\nBrown, George Greene, and Charles Weare, who were added from Linn\r\ncounty. George Greene was elected president and Charles Mason, vice\r\npresident. By June, 1868, the two roads were united under one name, the\r\nBurlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern, Greene becoming president, and D.\r\nW. C. Rowley secretary. By January 1, 1871, trains were running between\r\nCedar Rapids and Burlington, and early the following year they reached\r\nto St. Paul, thus making one of the first great north and south roads\r\nin Iowa. For many years C. J. Ives was president of the road till it\r\nwas absorbed by the Rock Island system, when the headquarters were\r\ntransferred to Chicago, the Cedar Rapids office becoming merely a\r\ndivision point.\r\n\r\nThe Dubuque and Southwestern Railway was operated from Dubuque to Cedar\r\nRapids in October, 1865. This was an important factor in the upbuilding\r\nof Marion and other towns along this road and in fact helped Cedar\r\nRapids. Like all small roads, it was not a financial success, and in\r\nMay, 1878, it was sold to the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway\r\nCompany and new life put into it. The Milwaukee road in 1883 extended\r\nthis line to Kansas City. The main line of the Milwaukee was extended\r\nto Omaha.\r\n\r\nThe building of the interurban to Iowa City, a distance of twenty-eight\r\nmiles, a few years ago concludes the railway building in Linn county,\r\nwith the exception of the Anamosa and Northwestern, which runs along\r\nthe northern part of the county; and the extension of the Illinois\r\nCentral, which runs down from Manchester, connecting with the main line\r\nat that place.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to give space here to the following account of\r\nbeginnings in Cedar Rapids. It is from Bailey & Hair's _Gazetteer_ for\r\n1865:\r\n\r\n     \"D. W. King and T. Gainor were the first settlers of any\r\n     advantage to the county. They reached here in 1839, and soon\r\n     after made a permanent settlement on the west side of the\r\n     river.\r\n\r\n     \"The first white man, however, who pitched his tent on the\r\n     ground, now occupied by the Valley City, was a notorious\r\n     counterfeiter and horse thief by the name of Shepherd, who\r\n     took up his abode and erected his cabin on what is now\r\n     Commercial street, near the mills, in the year 1838.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus early was this location selected as a central point\r\n     for commercial operations with the surrounding country, and\r\n     although the character of the operators was worse than some\r\n     who have followed them in business, it nevertheless\r\n     indicates their wisdom in making a good location for their\r\n     enterprise.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1849 D. W. King established ferries for crossing the\r\n     river, and continued to run them up to the time of his\r\n     death, in 1854. They were located at Iowa avenue and Linn\r\n     street crossings. They were self-propellers, being forced\r\n     across the river by the power of the current. A wire rope or\r\n     cable extended across the stream upon which a pulley was\r\n     placed, and connected by ropes to the boat. The first dam\r\n     across the Cedar river was commenced in 1842, and the first\r\n     saw mill erected in 1843.\r\n\r\n     \"In March, 1843, the lands came into market. The first\r\n     flouring mill was erected by N. B. Brown, in 1844-5, at a\r\n     cost of $3,000. Extensive additions have been made to this\r\n     mill since. It is still owned and run by Mr. Brown. In 1845,\r\n     A. Ely erected the second saw mill and the following year\r\n     the second flouring mill at a cost of $9,000. In 1848-9, the\r\n     first woolen factory was erected by N. B. Brown. Cost,\r\n     $10,000. The first steam engine was set in operation in\r\n     1855, in the machine shop of A. Hager.\r\n\r\n     \"The first store was owned by J. Greene in the building now\r\n     standing on the northeast corner of Iowa avenue and\r\n     Washington street. The second store was opened by Mr.\r\n     Cleveland, and the third by Mr. Mulford. The proprietor of\r\n     these stores have all left the city. Mulford's store was\r\n     destroyed by fire in 1850, being the first building thus\r\n     destroyed in Cedar Rapids. The second fire occurred in 1855,\r\n     when the buildings on the west side of Commercial street,\r\n     between Iowa avenue and Linn street, were mostly consumed.\r\n     The postoffice was established in 1847, and J. Greene\r\n     appointed postmaster.\r\n\r\n     \"The first brick building was erected in 1844, on the\r\n     northwest corner of Iowa avenue and Washington street, by P.\r\n     W. Earle, and is now occupied by him. The Union House, on\r\n     the northwest corner of Adams and Market streets, was the\r\n     first hotel. It was destroyed by fire early in 1865. The\r\n     first school house was erected in 1847, and the first school\r\n     taught by Nelson Felch. This structure is now occupied as a\r\n     dwelling on the north side of Eagle street between Jefferson\r\n     and Madison. The first white child born was the daughter of\r\n     John Vardy, now removed to Texas. The first church erected\r\n     is that commonly known as the 'Muddy,' and is still used as\r\n     a house of worship. It is a small 'grout' building at the\r\n     southeast corner of Eagle and Adams streets. The first death\r\n     was that of a young man by the name of William Brookey, some\r\n     time in 1843. The first frame building was built by John\r\n     Vardy.\r\n\r\n     \"The lodge of Free Masons was established in 1850, and James\r\n     Keeler, an Episcopal minister, was the first W. M. The lodge\r\n     took the name of Cedar Rapids Lodge No. 25. Its name was\r\n     changed in 1864 to the more euphonious and Masonic name of\r\n     Crescent.\r\n\r\n     \"The first newspaper was established by D. O. Finch, in\r\n     1854. Three volumes only were issued. D. O. Finch, James J.\r\n     Child, and James L. Enos, were successively its editors. The\r\n     _Era_ was purchased in 1854 by James L. Enos, and the name\r\n     changed to the _Cedar Valley Times_, by which name it still\r\n     flourishes. C. M. Hollis, Esq., is the present editor. The\r\n     second paper was the _Cedar Valley Farmer_, J. L. Enos,\r\n     editor. The _Cedar Rapids Democrat_ was the third paper\r\n     established, by W. W. Perkins & Co., in 1856. The _Voice of\r\n     Iowa_ was commenced in January, 1857, by the Iowa State\r\n     Teachers' Association, and J. L. Enos elected editor. This\r\n     journal reached a large circulation, and did much to give\r\n     form to the school system of the state. The present public\r\n     school edifice was erected in 1856-7-8, at a cost of some\r\n     $15,000. It has six departments, and employs seven or eight\r\n     teachers.\r\n\r\n     \"Cedar Rapids was incorporated as a city in 1856, and Isaac\r\n     Newton Whittam, Esq., was chosen the first mayor. A free\r\n     bridge was constructed across the Cedar in 1855-6, but was\r\n     soon carried away by the ice. As it fell, a large number\r\n     were standing on the banks watching the ice as it rapidly\r\n     tore the stone piers from their positions. Two sisters,\r\n     daughters of Mr. Black, passed by the guard, which was\r\n     stationed at the end of the bridge to keep the people from\r\n     passing on, and had reached about the middle, when the frail\r\n     fabric went down. Both young ladies were drowned, and the\r\n     body of one was never recovered. A toll bridge was erected\r\n     the following year, and though a slender structure, has thus\r\n     far withstood the action of the ice, though occasionally\r\n     broken down by cattle passing over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"KINGSTON CITY\r\n\r\n     \"Is a place of about 350 inhabitants, situated on the west\r\n     side of the Cedar river, opposite the city of Cedar Rapids.\r\n     It is connected with this city by a wooden bridge, and is\r\n     about one-quarter of a mile from the Cedar Rapids depot of\r\n     the Chicago and Northwestern railroad. In the year 1838\r\n     Robert Ellis and O. Bowling settled on land in the vicinity,\r\n     and in the year following Messrs. Isaac, John, and Joseph\r\n     Lichtebarger settled where Kingston now stands. During the\r\n     summer following David W. King and Thomas Gainor arrived\r\n     here. The first child born was Mary Jane, daughter of T. and\r\n     R. Gainor, on the 15th of May, 1840. Rosannah Gainor died on\r\n     the 8th of June, 1840. This was the first death in the\r\n     place. There is in the place one paper mill, one saw mill,\r\n     two blacksmith shops, two groceries, and one dry goods\r\n     store. There are three religious societies, Methodist\r\n     Episcopal, Congregationalist, and United Presbyterian. There\r\n     is also a commodious building for school purposes, and three\r\n     libraries. This region of country is especially adapted to\r\n     growing grain. Large quantities are annually shipped to\r\n     Chicago from this place. The immense water-power will at no\r\n     distant day make this a large manufacturing town.\"\r\n\r\nThe following as to early things in Cedar Rapids is taken from a copy\r\nof the _Cedar Valley Times_, J. L. Enos, editor, in 1865:\r\n\r\n     \"On the 4th day of July, 1841, N. B. Brown began\r\n     construction of a dam for utilization of the power. Carson,\r\n     Gray and Roach soon sold their interests to Messrs. Brown\r\n     and Greene, who became the sole proprietors of the\r\n     water-power, and constructed the first saw mill in 1842-3.\r\n     This mill is yet standing in the rear of Brown's flouring\r\n     mill, which was also the first grist mill, and erected in\r\n     1843, and extensively enlarged by the present owner in\r\n     1854-5.\r\n\r\n     \"The first blacksmith in the place was Harrison Campbell,\r\n     who opened a shop in Shepherd's old cabin in 1843. Isaac\r\n     Cook, Esq., was the first lawyer, John L. Shearer the first\r\n     justice, and James Lewis the first constable. The name of\r\n     the first physician seems to be lost from the memory of the\r\n     'early day,' though many of his peculiar traits of character\r\n     are remembered. Like some others in the profession he was\r\n     disposed to blow his own trumpet, and the stories he told to\r\n     the uninitiated ones were marvelous in the extreme. Once\r\n     when he had returned from Muscatine he claimed to have lost\r\n     forty pounds of quinine in one of the streams which put into\r\n     the Cedar below the city--the water being unusually high.\r\n     His credit was evidently then better than afterward, as was\r\n     also his physical courage. Constable Lewis, at one time\r\n     called upon him with an execution to secure a judgment, when\r\n     the doctor becoming wrathy, threw off his coat for a fight.\r\n     The constable being more intent on collecting the claim than\r\n     emulous for notoriety as a pugilist, seized the coat and\r\n     made away with it--finding a sufficient amount of money to\r\n     pay the debt. Dr. S. M. Brice remained here for a few months\r\n     and then removed to Center Point. Dr. E. L. Mansfield was\r\n     the first physician who made a permanent location in this\r\n     city, and still enjoys a large and lucrative practice. He\r\n     came here in 1847 and has ever since been engaged in the\r\n     noble endeavor--to heal the thousand natural ills that flesh\r\n     is heir to.\r\n\r\n     \"The first brick building was erected in 1844, by P. W.\r\n     Earle, Esq., on the west corner of Iowa avenue and\r\n     Washington street. This building is still occupied by Mr.\r\n     Earle, and shows but little the marks of age. A three-story\r\n     brick store was erected the same year on the south corner of\r\n     Iowa avenue and Commercial street. This building has since\r\n     been removed to make room for the block of stores extending\r\n     from Iowa avenue down the west side of Commercial street\r\n     toward Eagle street. Greene's hotel, a fine-appearing brick\r\n     hotel four stories high, also occupied a portion of this\r\n     ground. It was erected in 1853-4 by George Greene, and was\r\n     kept by various persons as a first-class hotel until it was\r\n     taken down to make room for a new brick block, which was\r\n     erected in 1862.\r\n\r\n     \"The first store proper was opened in the building now\r\n     standing on the north corner of Iowa avenue and Washington\r\n     street, by Joseph Greene. As early as 1842 Mr. Greene had a\r\n     store in one part of a log building located on the north\r\n     corner of Commercial and Sugar streets, the other end of the\r\n     same building being occupied as a boarding house or hotel.\r\n\r\n     \"The first building erected for a hotel was built by William\r\n     Dwyer in 1847, James Gunning being the first landlord. The\r\n     building was destroyed by fire in January, 1865. It was\r\n     known as the Union House and was located on the west corner\r\n     of Market and Adams streets.\r\n\r\n     \"The Adventists held meetings here as early as 1842-3; a Mr.\r\n     Baker being the minister. The Protestant and Episcopal\r\n     Methodists also had organizations at an early day. The\r\n     Presbyterians organized soon after and erected the first\r\n     church edifice, known as the 'Big Muddy,' taking its name\r\n     from the material of which it was composed. It is a grout\r\n     building, occupying the east corner of Eagle street and\r\n     Adams street. The Universalists had an organization here\r\n     quite early and were 'ministered unto' by Rev. Mr. Westfall.\r\n     In either 1843 or '44 a somewhat noted discussion was held\r\n     between Mr. Westfall, the Universalist, and Mr. Roberts, Old\r\n     School Presbyterian, at which Joseph Greene acted as umpire.\r\n     The discussion continued for four days and nights. The\r\n     meetings were largely attended and the combatants were sharp\r\n     and excited. The conflict ended as such discussions usually\r\n     do--in the victory of both--and this was regarded by nearly\r\n     all as a drawn game.\r\n\r\n     \"The first school was kept by Miss Emily Coffman. The first\r\n     school building was erected in 1846-7, by a company\r\n     consisting of N. B. Brown, George Greene, Alex. Ely, and\r\n     others, who sold it to the district, and had the\r\n     satisfaction of being taxed to pay themselves for it. This\r\n     building was on the north side of Eagle street between\r\n     Jefferson and Madison. It is still standing and is occupied\r\n     as a dwelling house. Nelson Felch was among the first\r\n     teachers, also a Mr. Freeman, who has since been receiving\r\n     instruction in a state institution located at Fort Madison.\r\n\r\n     \"The second saw mill was erected by Alex Ely in 1844 and the\r\n     second flouring mill in 1844-5. Mr. Ely died shortly after\r\n     the completion of this mill. In 1848 N. B. Brown built the\r\n     first woolen factory. The first steam engine was put up here\r\n     in 1855 by A. Hager, in his sash, door and blind\r\n     manufactory. He had an extensive amount of machinery\r\n     connected with it and employed a number of workmen.\r\n\r\n     \"The second store was established by Mr. Cleveland, and the\r\n     third by C. K. Mulford. Mulford's store was afterward\r\n     occupied as a dwelling, on the east corner of Commercial and\r\n     Linn streets, and was destroyed by fire in 1850. That was\r\n     the first fire in Cedar Rapids, and none occurred after it\r\n     until the autumn of 1855, when most of the block on the west\r\n     side of Commercial street, between Iowa avenue and Linn\r\n     street, was destroyed. No precautions have been taken to\r\n     prevent the spread of the destroying element, and were a\r\n     fire to occur tomorrow no more means would be found of\r\n     subduing it than existed twenty years ago. It would seem\r\n     that a wise people would not thus neglect what may at any\r\n     moment be of such vast importance. But so it is, and so it\r\n     is likely to remain until a fire shall occur that will lay\r\n     in ruins a large portion of our city and destroy thousands\r\n     of dollars worth of property. Personal insurance can best\r\n     cover a part of this loss and perhaps not one-half are\r\n     provided with this protection.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPRODUCTION _of_ THE FIRST MAP OF CEDAR RAPIDS (Part\r\n1)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPRODUCTION _of_ THE FIRST MAP OF CEDAR RAPIDS (Part\r\n2)\r\n\r\nThe old map was made in 1859 and the only copy now in existence is the\r\nproperty of Mr. Lew W. Anderson. It is yellow, faded and dim and in\r\nmany parts was difficult to trace. It has been used many times as\r\nevidence in court in legal contests over property rights. The\r\nreproduction shows clearly the original plat of the city including\r\nKingston, the islands, parks, squares, blocks, additions, stations,\r\nstreets, names, etc. The street names have nearly all been changed\r\nsince that time.]\r\n\r\nDr. Seymour D. Carpenter, who came to Cedar Rapids in 1849, contributed\r\nthe below quoted memoirs to a _History of Crescent Lodge_, J. E.\r\nMorcombe, author, and published by the lodge in 1906. It is of value in\r\nthe consideration of the history of early times in the city and county:\r\n\r\n     \"I wished to read law, but there was a family prejudice\r\n     against the profession, and I concluded to study medicine\r\n     and accordingly entered as a student the office of Drs.\r\n     Boerstler & Edwards, who were among the leading physicians.\r\n     There for a year I read books that were full of what are now\r\n     exploded theories and practice, at the end of which time I\r\n     was sent to the University of Pennsylvania, where two years\r\n     after I was graduated as a doctor of medicine. Returning\r\n     home in the spring of 1849, I remained but a few months and\r\n     then started west 'to grow up with the country.' I again\r\n     rode to Cincinnati on horseback, took steamer to St. Louis,\r\n     thence by another boat up the Illinois river to Haverville.\r\n     Not liking the place, I rode west and crossed the\r\n     Mississippi at Quincy and went to Kirksville in Missouri.\r\n     Still not pleased, I turned north and went to Ottumwa, Iowa,\r\n     where I met Judge Greene, then a member of the supreme bench\r\n     of Iowa. He persuaded me that Cedar Rapids was in the near\r\n     future to become a metropolis, and I decided to go there.\r\n     After four days' hard riding and swimming several swollen\r\n     streams, I struck the town on the afternoon of the 14th of\r\n     June, 1849. I crossed the river on a rope ferry operated by\r\n     David King, who lived in a cabin on the west side. On the\r\n     other side of the river stood the cabin once the home of a\r\n     man named Shepherd, and said to have been the resort of\r\n     thieves in an earlier day. I cannot say that I was very\r\n     favorably impressed by the thirty or forty mostly one-story\r\n     unpainted houses that were scattered about near the river.\r\n     There seemed to be a great deal of sand, and the houses were\r\n     so situated that there was no sign of a street. There were\r\n     three two-story houses, one on the river near the foot of\r\n     what is now Third avenue, called the 'Park house,' in which\r\n     the Greenes had their store; one on second street in which\r\n     John Coffman kept a hotel, and one on Third avenue, back of\r\n     the Dows & Ely block, also a hotel, but keeper's name\r\n     forgotten. I was discouraged and would have traveled further\r\n     but only had about ten dollars left, and from necessity had\r\n     to stop. I put up at the Coffman hotel, which, as I have\r\n     said, was a two-story structure with a wing. It had been\r\n     built of unseasoned oak lumber and was not plastered. The\r\n     whole of the second story of the main building was in one\r\n     room, and contained eight or ten beds and was the common\r\n     sleeping room of the guests. The lumber had shrunk and there\r\n     could be no complaint as to ventilation, however short the\r\n     accommodations might be in other respects. I had hardly got\r\n     settled before I was interviewed by old Joe Leverich, a\r\n     noted character of Linn county of that day. He was known as\r\n     the 'Bogus Coon,' because, as was alleged, he had to do with\r\n     counterfeiters. He was a power in politics and was the kind\r\n     of a man from which the modern 'pop' has evoluted. Joe\r\n     looked me over, asked where I was from, where I was going,\r\n     what my business was, etc., etc. I was somewhat indignant\r\n     and tried to be sarcastic, but Joe, in terminating his\r\n     interview, squelched me by remarking: 'Young man, a fellow\r\n     that wears such a hat as you do may pass in this country,\r\n     but I consider it d--d doubtful.' I unfortunately wore a\r\n     'plug' hat which was not the style in Iowa a half century\r\n     ago. In subsequent years Joe and I became fast friends, and\r\n     I became quite convinced that the shady stories told of him\r\n     were the talk of enemies who were jealous of him because he\r\n     was smarter than the great majority of them. I was with him\r\n     when he died, and, although a free-thinker, he passed away\r\n     with all the calmness of a stoic philosopher.\r\n\r\n     \"Within a week I made the acquaintance of all the people of\r\n     the town. Among the leading persons were William and Joseph\r\n     Greene, brothers of the judge, Lowell and Lawson Daniels,\r\n     Homer Bishop and John Weare, all of whom were merchants.\r\n     The three stores of which they were the proprietors would\r\n     not compare well with the department stores of today, but\r\n     all the same they were department stores, and in their\r\n     miscellaneous stocks the customer could find all he wanted,\r\n     from castor oil to broad-axes. Pollock & Stewart were the\r\n     blacksmiths, and the carpenters and wagon-makers were also\r\n     represented, but I cannot recall their names.\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Mansfield took me as a partner, and in company with\r\n     Judge Cook, we had a room, 10×16, in a small one-story\r\n     building opposite the mill, the other part being occupied by\r\n     S. L. Pollock and family. His blacksmith shop was near by.\r\n     Our medicines were kept on a shelf and a store box made a\r\n     table. Our bunks occupied one side and a few stools and two\r\n     split-bottomed chairs made up our furniture. We took our\r\n     meals at the Coffman house. Our field of practice embraced\r\n     the settlers, not numerous, in the valleys of the Cedar and\r\n     Iowa rivers and their tributaries. We made very long rides.\r\n     I was called to see a patient two miles above the present\r\n     town of Vinton, not then begun. I got lost in the night and\r\n     waited for daylight under a tree on the bank of the river at\r\n     the very spot where Vinton now stands. Bilious fever and\r\n     ague were the prevailing diseases, all the newcomers having\r\n     to undergo one or both. As patients and clients were not\r\n     very numerous, we had a good deal of leisure. Judge Cook was\r\n     a fine reader and we took turns at Shakespeare, a copy of\r\n     which we fortunately possessed. During the summer Dr.\r\n     Mansfield and myself built a story and half office on\r\n     Commercial street, about the middle of the block on which\r\n     the Daniels store was located. We had a mail three times a\r\n     week from Dubuque and Iowa City. The Higley brothers did the\r\n     service in a two-horse hack. I think Joseph Greene was\r\n     postmaster. John Weare, Sr., was justice of the peace. He\r\n     was a very original character, fond of company and full of\r\n     interesting reminiscences extending back to the war of 1812,\r\n     in which he had lost a leg. His small office was in the rear\r\n     of Mrs. Ely's residence, which stood on the ground where the\r\n     Dows & Ely block now is. He gave 'nicknames' to many people\r\n     and places which stuck to them like burrs. The first\r\n     Presbyterian or Congregational church building was begun\r\n     that summer, and as the walls were built of cement, old Mr.\r\n     Weare named it the 'Muddy,' which it retained to the last\r\n     day of its existence. Many buildings were put up that year\r\n     with a corresponding increase in population. All the people\r\n     were full of hope and ambition. We began to talk of\r\n     railroads. The people of Dubuque and Keokuk, the leading\r\n     river towns, started a scheme for a road running through the\r\n     interior and connecting them. The people along the line, at\r\n     Cascade, Anamosa, Marion, Cedar Rapids, Washington and\r\n     Fairfield eagerly endorsed the project, meetings were held\r\n     and it was resolved to hold two delegate conventions, on the\r\n     same day, one at Anamosa, the other at Fairfield. We had a\r\n     rousing meeting in Cedar Rapids. There were nearly a hundred\r\n     people present, and they resolved to have the railroad\r\n     forthwith. From our standpoint it was the government's duty\r\n     to donate land, and for eastern people to furnish the money.\r\n     Delegates were chosen to both conventions. Dr. John F. Ely\r\n     and myself were selected to go to Fairfield. Both\r\n     conventions were to be held on the 6th of December, 1849. We\r\n     left Cedar Rapids on the 3d of December and after three\r\n     days' hard and cold travel reached Fairfield. Marion sent\r\n     Col. I. M. Preston and Dr. Ristine. The convention met in a\r\n     small school house. All the counties were represented. The\r\n     Hon. C. W. Slagle, of Fairfield, then a very young man, was\r\n     chosen president. I was chosen secretary. The little school\r\n     house was packed, and if any doubt the courage and scope of\r\n     that convention, let him look up the old file of newspapers\r\n     of that day and read. Dr. Ballard, of Iowa City, Stewart\r\n     Goodsel, of Brighton, Joseph Casey, of Keokuk county, and\r\n     General Van Plank Van Antwerp were present and took active\r\n     part. We parted for our various homes, thinking the work\r\n     half done, but sad to relate, Cedar Rapids had to wait ten\r\n     years longer for the locomotive. These two meetings were,\r\n     as I think, the first railroad conventions held in the\r\n     interior of the state. Soon opposition schemes were started\r\n     for east and west lines, and our project was ignominiously\r\n     called the 'Ram's Horn.' The next year was quite a stirring\r\n     one. New people were coming in great numbers, but many were\r\n     leaving, for the California fever had broken out. Several\r\n     outfits left Cedar Rapids, and with one of them Dr.\r\n     Mansfield, my partner, whose place was taken by Dr. S. C.\r\n     Koontz, a cousin of mine, one well known to the old\r\n     citizens. That year the first brick buildings were erected,\r\n     a dwelling on Iowa avenue near Greene's opera house, and a\r\n     three-story building on Commercial street, by Judge Greene,\r\n     which for a long time was the show building of the town. We\r\n     began to put on city airs.\r\n\r\n     \"At this time Martin L. Barber was mayor of the village. It\r\n     was before the present city organization. Barber was an\r\n     eccentric character, a millwright by trade. He was nearly as\r\n     wise as Solomon, with courage to match. A 'bad man' came to\r\n     the town. He hung about the saloon. It was said he drew a\r\n     knife and threatened to kill a citizen. The majesty of the\r\n     law was invoked. It was night. The offender took refuge in\r\n     the saloon and barricaded the door. The mayor called out the\r\n     'posse commitatus' numbering two or three dozen young\r\n     fellows like myself. He pounded on the door, demanding\r\n     admittance in the name of the law. No response. We got a\r\n     piece of timber and battered down the door. The mayor\r\n     collared the 'bad man' who offered no resistance. He was\r\n     hurried towards the Coffman house, where the mayor proposed\r\n     to deal out justice. As we neared the hotel he tore loose\r\n     from the mayor and made for the river. We in full cry in\r\n     pursuit. He plunged in just below the mill. We paused at the\r\n     brink. Gradually he disappeared, and was never seen\r\n     afterwards. It was the first and last exhibition of the\r\n     mayor's power.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1850 Miss Mary S. Legare, sister of the Hon. Hugh S.\r\n     Legare of South Carolina, came to Cedar Rapids. She was a\r\n     woman of the highest culture, who had moved much in the\r\n     official circles of Washington, and had considerable wealth.\r\n     With her came numerous relatives named Bryan, Storey, and\r\n     McIntosh, the latter a well known lawyer of the early days.\r\n     She made investments in the town and took up large tracts of\r\n     land. In the spring of that year we had a very spirited\r\n     election. The people were divided into two factions, the\r\n     'codfish' and the 'catfish.' For mayor the former nominated\r\n     N. B. Brown, the latter Jacob Bressler. I cannot recall the\r\n     issues, but only remember that we almost came to blows\r\n     during the canvass. Less than one hundred votes were cast\r\n     and Brown was elected. Brown was one of the original owners\r\n     of the town site, and built the first mills. He was one of\r\n     the prominent characters in the early history of the town, a\r\n     modest, quiet, but genial man, with many friends.\r\n\r\n     \"This year, on the 6th of July, I did one of the few wise\r\n     acts of my life. I married Sarah Weare, the daughter of John\r\n     Weare, Sr. We went to housekeeping in a small one-story\r\n     house, near where the old passenger depot stood. It was then\r\n     the only house east of the present railroad. The next year,\r\n     1851, was a very active one for the town. Judge Greene, who\r\n     had lived in Dubuque, moved to the town. The same year came\r\n     S. C. Bever, who had driven in a two-horse buggy from Holmes\r\n     county, Ohio, to Cedar Rapids. By this time I considered\r\n     myself an old citizen, thoroughly identified with the county\r\n     and town, and devoted all my leisure time to meeting\r\n     strangers and exploiting the town and county. I met Mr.\r\n     Bever soon after his arrival and spent several days with him\r\n     riding about the country. He made large investments both in\r\n     country and town. One was 160 acres about a mile from the\r\n     ferry, at $5.00 per acre. I made the sale for Mr. Addison\r\n     Daniels of Marion, who was so pleased with my effort that he\r\n     presented me with a four-bladed penknife. Both Mr. Daniels\r\n     and myself were satisfied and I have never heard that Mr.\r\n     Bever regretted the purchase. That same year my father, Mr.\r\n     Gabriel Carpenter, came out to see the country. After great\r\n     effort on my part and many misgivings on his, he purchased\r\n     of Mr. Levi Lewis 300 acres of land adjoining the town plat\r\n     on the south, for which he paid $2,500. The land embraced\r\n     the present cemetery. By this time Judge Greene had\r\n     completed his three-story building, into which the Greene\r\n     Bros. placed a large stock of goods. The most of their stock\r\n     was brought up the river in a keel boat of forty or fifty\r\n     tons capacity. It was rigged with a large square sail, but\r\n     the principal power was men with poles, who shoved it\r\n     against the current. They had loaded it with pork and sent\r\n     it down the river in the spring.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1851 occurred the great flood. Most of the lower parts\r\n     of the town were under water. The grand lodge met that year\r\n     at Ft. Madison, and at the time the river was at its highest\r\n     point. We were cut off from all the neighboring country by\r\n     the swollen streams, but the lodge thought it must be\r\n     represented and I was chosen as the delegate. N. B. Brown\r\n     suggested that I should go down the river in a skiff to a\r\n     point opposite Muscatine, then by land to that place, which\r\n     is only ten or twelve miles distant, then by steamer to Ft.\r\n     Madison. The lodge furnished the skiff. I found a companion.\r\n     We embarked in the morning and so swift was the current that\r\n     we reached our destination by nightfall, and I was on time\r\n     for the meeting. At the meeting I renewed my acquaintance\r\n     with the grand master and the grand secretary, and met many\r\n     brethren who became lifelong friends.\r\n\r\n     \"In the spring of 1852 a steamboat came to Cedar Rapids. It\r\n     was a great event, and brought in people from near and far.\r\n     She brought a full cargo of freight, among which was the\r\n     household effects of Mr. Bever and my father, both of whom\r\n     from that time forward became citizens of the town. This\r\n     year also came Mr. Daniel O. Finch with a printing press and\r\n     forthwith started the _Progressive Era_, the first paper in\r\n     the Cedar valley. Ezra Van Metre, a talented young lawyer\r\n     from Cincinnati, Ohio, also came that year. Every one was\r\n     rejoiced that we had an organ and the editor was overwhelmed\r\n     with original matter. There were at least a dozen young\r\n     fellows in the town, myself among the rest, who thought they\r\n     'knew it all,' and anxiously rushed into print. The paper\r\n     changed hands in a year or two, and became the _Cedar Valley\r\n     Times_ and continued until a few years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEDERAL BUILDING, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUDITORIUM, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n     \"In the winter of 1852 I had a serious time in a\r\n     professional way. A young man living at Quasqueton, Buchanan\r\n     county, was riding across the prairie near that place and\r\n     met a bear. The bear fled and he pursued. In crossing a\r\n     strip of ice the horse fell. He was thrown and his foot\r\n     stuck in the stirrup and he was dragged four miles over the\r\n     snow, which was about six inches deep. In the mad flight the\r\n     horse kicked and broke his right leg below the knee in two\r\n     places. Finally the saddle turned, his foot was released and\r\n     he was dropped on the lone prairie. The horse found his way\r\n     home with saddle under his belly. This was on the evening of\r\n     the 17th of December. A search was organized, but he was not\r\n     found till the 21st, four days after the accident.\r\n     Fortunately the weather was not as cold as it sometimes\r\n     gets, but his hands and feet were badly frozen. Cedar\r\n     Rapids, about thirty-five miles distant, was the nearest\r\n     point where doctors could be found. I was sent for and went\r\n     by the way of Marion, and took with me Dr. Thomas Bardwell,\r\n     who was then a student in Dr. Ristine's office. There was a\r\n     road to Center Point. There we struck across the prairie to\r\n     Quasqueton, eighteen miles distant, without a house. We\r\n     reached there the evening of the 23d, nearly frozen\r\n     ourselves, for the weather was bitterly cold. They had got\r\n     the young man thawed out, but in a most miserable condition.\r\n     Mortification had set in, and there was no chance for the\r\n     broken leg. Immediate amputation was the only hope, but I\r\n     had no instrument but a small pocket case, and delay would\r\n     be fatal. Necessity is the mother of invention. A butcher\r\n     had just come to the place and had his tools. He sharpened\r\n     his knives and filed his saw. A strong handkerchief was\r\n     twisted, a knot made in the middle, which was placed over\r\n     the main artery. It was tied tightly and a strong stick\r\n     thrust under it and twisted till the circulation was shut\r\n     off. Then with the butcher's tool I amputated the thigh four\r\n     inches above the knee. Dr. Bardwell administered chloroform,\r\n     which fortunately we had taken with us, and he encouraged me\r\n     by word and deed. The young fellow, who was about 21, had\r\n     never been sick a day in his life, rallied well and improved\r\n     for about a week, but the other leg, which we hoped to save,\r\n     began to mortify and there was nothing left but to amputate\r\n     it. In the meantime we heard of a doctor about thirty miles\r\n     away, in the direction of Dubuque, who had a case of\r\n     instruments. I sent to borrow them. He refused to lend them\r\n     but came back with the messenger and insisted, as he owned\r\n     the instruments, he should perform the operation. That was\r\n     not professional, but as I thought the patient had not more\r\n     than one chance in ten to recover, I was not unwilling to\r\n     divide the responsibility; so he amputated the other leg\r\n     below the knee. During that winter I made eight trips\r\n     between Cedar Rapids and Quasqueton on horseback, and the\r\n     fellow recovered. He was the son of a well-to-do farmer in\r\n     Harrison county, Ohio. His father came out in the spring,\r\n     stole his son away without paying the doctors or the man in\r\n     whose house he had been during recovery, and to carry\r\n     ingratitude still further he procured a Methodist preacher\r\n     to write his life, in which I was depicted as an ignorant\r\n     butcher. This book he peddled about Ohio in person. I\r\n     confess that when I heard he had been sent to the\r\n     penitentiary for committing an aggravated rape I was not\r\n     very sorry. This experience rather disgusted me with the\r\n     practice of medicine in a new country. I was, however, in a\r\n     way compensated, for I sent a history of the case to the New\r\n     York _Tribune_, and its publication gave me quite a\r\n     reputation as a fearless surgeon and thereafter I was called\r\n     when surgery was required. As I have said before, I was in\r\n     the habit of showing strangers about the country who wanted\r\n     to buy land. In that way I became familiar with choice lots\r\n     of vacant land. Greene and Weare dealt in land warrants,\r\n     which they sold on a credit at three per cent per month\r\n     interest. I knew of a section of land in the Iowa river\r\n     bottom that I thought I should be able to sell. I borrowed\r\n     the land warrants, entered the section and in less than two\r\n     months had sold it for $3 per acre cash. That settled the\r\n     matter. By one transaction I had made more than I had done\r\n     in any year's practice. I sold out my medicines to Dr.\r\n     Koontz and thenceforth till the war had nothing to do with\r\n     medicine.\r\n\r\n     \"About 1853-4 we began to lose confidence in the 'Ram's\r\n     Horn' railroad project. Congress had made grants of land to\r\n     aid railroad projects and public opinion seemed to favor\r\n     east and west rather than north and south lines. Roads from\r\n     Chicago were approaching the Mississippi river, and a line\r\n     from Rock Island to Council Bluffs was projected. The people\r\n     in the tier of counties north of the projected line became\r\n     stirred up and a railroad convention was called to meet in\r\n     Maquoketa, Jackson county, to organize a company to build a\r\n     line in their interest. Cedar Rapids sent a delegation as\r\n     follows: George Greene, N. B. Brown, Daniel Lothian, I. N.\r\n     Whittam, Donald McIntosh, Ezra Van Metre, and myself. Marion\r\n     also sent a large delegation and the counties along the line\r\n     were well represented. A company was organized to build a\r\n     line from Savanna on the Mississippi river to a point on the\r\n     Missouri river not named. A corps of surveyors was put in\r\n     the field and for two or three years it was the favorite\r\n     project of Cedar Rapids. The settlements both in town and\r\n     country were increasing rapidly and we suffered greatly for\r\n     lack of transportation. Judge Greene, with his usual energy\r\n     and public spirit, organized a steamboat company in which\r\n     the prominent citizens became stockholders. This was in the\r\n     winter. The judge went to Pittsburg, contracted for a boat\r\n     suitable for our river, which by spring was completed and at\r\n     the opening of navigation made her first trip, well\r\n     freighted with all kinds of goods for our own merchants, and\r\n     those of the surrounding towns. She was kept in commission\r\n     for two or three years and was a great benefit to the\r\n     community. The company hired a captain and various\r\n     stockholders were at different times supercargo. While H. G.\r\n     Angle was acting in that capacity she collided with and sunk\r\n     another boat on the Mississippi, which led to a law suit in\r\n     which our company had to pay large damages, which swept away\r\n     all our profits. She made her last trip under my charge, and\r\n     under direction of the company I sold her to parties in St.\r\n     Louis. By this time a great rivalry had grown up between our\r\n     town and Marion. Cedar Rapids claimed that she was to be the\r\n     commercial metropolis and therefore ought to be the\r\n     political center. The question was brought to an issue by\r\n     the county commissioners ordering a new court house at\r\n     Marion, subject to the approval of the voters of the county.\r\n     Cedar Rapids opposed the measure, believing that the\r\n     building would insure the permanent location of the county\r\n     seat. Then ensued a most bitter canvass. The voters were\r\n     deluged with oratory. Marion put on the stump Judge Isbell,\r\n     I. M. Preston, Col. Wm. Smythe, N. M. Hubbard, W. G.\r\n     Thompson, and R. D. Stephens, against whom Cedar Rapids\r\n     opposed Jas. J. Child, Ezra Van Metre, Donald McIntosh, A.\r\n     S. Belt, E. N. Bates, I. N. Whittam, and others. Every\r\n     school district was canvassed and much bitter feeling\r\n     engendered. The Marion people were more adroit politicians\r\n     and carried the election, but the result did not discourage\r\n     our citizens, who asserted that no election could affect\r\n     'manifest destiny.'\r\n\r\n     \"About 1852 Major J. M. May came to Cedar Rapids from\r\n     Janesville, Wisconsin. The major was a stirring man with a\r\n     head full of schemes. He said that Cedar Rapids was a place\r\n     of immense possibilities and only wanted enterprise to make\r\n     it the great town of Iowa. He bought land at the lower part\r\n     of town adjoining that owned by my father, and land on the\r\n     west side adjoining the river and below that owned by Dr.\r\n     King. He platted out town lots on both sides of the river,\r\n     and induced my father and King to do the same, which were\r\n     the first additions made to the original town. He also\r\n     surveyed the island, sent a plat to the general government\r\n     and took possession of it, much to the chagrin and surprise\r\n     of the old settlers. Then he began to agitate the question\r\n     of a free bridge. Every one wanted a free bridge but were\r\n     undecided as to the location. The major induced my father to\r\n     subscribe $1,500, and he gave $1,000, which with sums\r\n     contributed by others in the lower end of the town, secured\r\n     the location below the island at the narrowest place in the\r\n     river. The bridge was completed and thrown open to the\r\n     public, I think, in the late fall of 1852, and proved a\r\n     great convenience. The construction was defective and when\r\n     the ice broke up in the spring, the heavy cakes knocked down\r\n     two of the piers, and destroyed the greater part of the\r\n     bridge. All the people of the town were collected on the\r\n     bank of the river watching the event, and two young women\r\n     who were crossing went down with the structure and were\r\n     drowned. This was the first bridge built at Cedar Rapids.\r\n     The next was a bridge of boats at the foot of Iowa avenue\r\n     which I believe was also swept away by ice. About this time\r\n     the Rev. Williston Jones, who officiated in the 'Muddy,' and\r\n     was a very good as well as energetic man, went east on some\r\n     missionary effort. While there he met a gentleman named Coe,\r\n     who made a donation of land adjoining the town plat for\r\n     educational purposes providing the people would also\r\n     contribute. A meeting was called and the terms complied with\r\n     and thus Coe college was founded. I was quite honored when\r\n     with others I was named as a trustee. Not long after this\r\n     time the Reverend Starr became rector of the Episcopal\r\n     church, and under the lead of Judge Greene and Mr. Bever,\r\n     they began the erection of the first Episcopal church, and\r\n     about the same time the Methodists built a brick church, so\r\n     you see Cedar Rapids began to get on 'praying grounds and\r\n     interceding terms.' In the winter of 1856-7 we were\r\n     surprised and flattered by receiving a communication from a\r\n     party of railroad men connected with the North-Western\r\n     railroad, then completed to Fulton, Illinois, asking us to\r\n     join them and organize a railroad company from Clinton on\r\n     the west side of the Mississippi river to our town. This was\r\n     a new proposition, and we had never heard of Clinton, which\r\n     in point of fact was only a cornfield staked out in town\r\n     lots, besides we were committed to the line that was to run\r\n     west from Savanna. We consulted with the Marion people, but\r\n     they would have nothing to do with it, arguing that we had\r\n     already applied for the land grant for the Savanna route.\r\n     After serious deliberation and with considerable misgivings,\r\n     we decided to send a delegation to spy out the land and be\r\n     governed by circumstances. John Weare and H. G. Angle were\r\n     chosen as our representatives. It took them three days to\r\n     drive to Lyons which was the nearest town to Clinton, the\r\n     proposed starting point. That was the first time any of our\r\n     citizens had come in contact with real capitalists, men who\r\n     built railroads. There they met a party of men from Boston,\r\n     from Maine, from New York, and Chicago, among whom was\r\n     Charles Walker of Chicago, then president of the\r\n     North-Western. Our deputations were swept from their old\r\n     moorings and immediately joined hands with these men and\r\n     formed a company, the 'Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska,' to build\r\n     west from Clinton, by the way of Cedar Rapids to the\r\n     Missouri river. Cedar Rapids was given first directors as\r\n     follows: Geo. Greene, John Weare, H. G. Angle, S. C. Bever,\r\n     and S. D. Carpenter, which positions we held till the road\r\n     was built to Cedar Rapids. This new departure on the part of\r\n     Cedar Rapids intensified the feeling of rivalry between her\r\n     and Marion; a direct line between Clinton and Cedar Rapids\r\n     would leave Marion off the route, besides the natural\r\n     obstacles were less from Mount Vernon to the river and\r\n     thence to Cedar Rapids. The Marionites denounced us as\r\n     traitors to the original scheme, with a malignant intent to\r\n     leave them out in the cold. We denied the 'allegation and\r\n     defied the alligators.'\r\n\r\n     \"We said there was nothing behind the old project, but that\r\n     ours was a live scheme, with experienced men with bags of\r\n     money to put it through. Our deputies had pledged $200,000\r\n     from Cedar Rapids, which we proceeded to raise, $100,000 by\r\n     private subscription and $100,000 by city bonds. Greene &\r\n     Weare, then bankers, subscribed $10,000; George Greene,\r\n     $5,000; John Weare, $5,000; N. B. Brown, $5,000; S. C.\r\n     Bever, $5,000; Gabriel Carpenter, $5,000, and numerous\r\n     others smaller sums to make up the amount. Then a city\r\n     election was had and the $100,000 voted by an overwhelming\r\n     majority. Surveys of the route were begun at once and from\r\n     Mount Vernon and Cedar Rapids, two lines were seen; one by\r\n     the way of Marion, and the other by the river. It was\r\n     ascertained that the latter route would be shorter and\r\n     cheaper by $100,000 than the former, but the company\r\n     proposed to adopt the Marion route if she would subscribe\r\n     $100,000, which she declined to do, and the river line was\r\n     chosen. Work progressed slowly and the first year found the\r\n     rails no further west than De Witt, Clinton county. Nothing\r\n     had been done on the Savanna line.\r\n\r\n     \"Meantime the legislature for 1857-8 assembled, and we were\r\n     astounded to learn that they had passed a bill giving a land\r\n     grant to that company. I do not remember why we had not\r\n     looked after our interests, but only know that we were taken\r\n     by surprise. We thought our enterprise in great jeopardy,\r\n     and resolved to compromise, if possible, with Marion. I\r\n     think that Judge Isbell was then president of the Savanna\r\n     company. Major May, who had favored the Marion line, for\r\n     what reason I now forget, and myself from a warm personal\r\n     friendship with Judge Isbell, were chosen ambassadors. We\r\n     met the judge and the Marion directors of the rival line.\r\n     They were courteous, but obdurate. They said we had deserted\r\n     them and run after strange gods, and now that the tables\r\n     were turned, they proposed to build the road straight west,\r\n     crossing the river eight miles north of Cedar Rapids, and\r\n     instead of their building a branch to Cedar Rapids, we if we\r\n     chose might build the branch from Cedar Rapids, and thus we\r\n     left them, sad and discouraged. 'Whom the gods would destroy\r\n     they first make mad,' and thus it turned out with the\r\n     Savanna route. The company was composed entirely of Iowa\r\n     men, directors from the various county seats and towns along\r\n     the line. Very soon after obtaining the grant, they got\r\n     together and voted each other $25,000 apiece for services\r\n     rendered in obtaining the land grant. As there were about\r\n     twenty of them, the scheme was loaded by about $500,000.\r\n     Then they tried to exploit the enterprise among eastern\r\n     capitalists. But the hard times of 1857-8 were upon us and\r\n     money was scarce both east and west. No one would take hold.\r\n     In the meantime our road was slowly creeping on, and was\r\n     within thirty miles of Cedar Rapids. The grading contract\r\n     was let to John G. Wolf, an experienced railroad builder\r\n     from the east. Most of the money to pay him had to be raised\r\n     among ourselves and pay day was a most serious time. I\r\n     remember upon one occasion, the cash entirely failed, but\r\n     the merchants of the town agreed to honor orders for goods,\r\n     Mr. Bever among the others. Mr. Bever had been a merchant in\r\n     Holmes county, Ohio, and brought his stock of goods from\r\n     there to Cedar Rapids. Among other things he had two or\r\n     three cases of bell crowned silk hats of a very ancient\r\n     date. On pay day our citizens were greatly amused to see our\r\n     streets crowded with Irishmen, all wearing bell crowned\r\n     hats, and as 'fire water' was plenty, before night a great\r\n     many of the hats were caved in. Our Marion friends hearing\r\n     of it said our company was 'busted,' our only assets\r\n     consisting of bell crowned hats. But we persevered and bided\r\n     our time. We called a mass meeting in the city preparatory\r\n     to forming a new company to build the road west from Cedar\r\n     Rapids to the Missouri river, and appointed a committee to\r\n     issue a prospectus to all the counties west of us on the\r\n     proposed line to meet in delegate convention at Cedar\r\n     Rapids. I had the honor of being chairman of that convention\r\n     and as such prepared the paper, and if you will examine the\r\n     file of newspapers of that day you will find a 'Spread\r\n     Eagle' document that I supposed would move the souls of our\r\n     frontier friends. They responded nobly and came on the time\r\n     designated, and we organized the 'Cedar Rapids & Missouri\r\n     Railroad Company,' at least I believe that was the name. L.\r\n     B. Crocker, of New York, was made president, with several\r\n     eastern and western directors, myself among the number. Then\r\n     as the company to whom the legislature had given the grant\r\n     of land, had not turned a spadeful of earth, we organized a\r\n     lobby embracing all our directors on the line west of us; L.\r\n     B. Crocker, the president, Major Bodfish, a Maine man, and\r\n     several of our Cedar Rapids directors, myself among the\r\n     others. When the legislature assembled in 1859-60 we invaded\r\n     the capital, and established our headquarters in an old\r\n     hotel near the river, whose name I have forgotten. Major\r\n     Bodfish was the commissary of the body. We had no money to\r\n     expend, but determined to be hospitable. The major laid in a\r\n     barrel of old rye whiskey; as it was before the war, whiskey\r\n     was cheap, also several boxes of cigars. One of our\r\n     strongest henchmen was J. M. Woodbury, a leading man from\r\n     Marshalltown, and with him Peter Hepburn, now an honored\r\n     congressman, then a very stripling, but showing evident\r\n     signs of what was in him. John J. Kasson was then a young\r\n     lawyer in Des Moines, and we secured him as our attorney.\r\n     Our opponents were not asleep, but were on hand from Marion,\r\n     east to the Mississippi river, with Platt Smith, a\r\n     distinguished member of the bar at Dubuque, as their lawyer.\r\n     Then the fight began, in and out of the state house.\r\n     Speeches were made by our adherents in both branches, and we\r\n     buttonholed and dragged to our headquarters all thirsty\r\n     souls, as well as those who indulged in the milder\r\n     stimulant. Our strong argument was, that our opponents had\r\n     done nothing after having the grant for two years, while we\r\n     had about completed eighty miles of road without help; that\r\n     we only asked for the grant to apply to the line west of\r\n     Cedar Rapids, while they would use it for the line from the\r\n     Mississippi, and that we would be able to accommodate the\r\n     people with a finished road at least two years before they\r\n     could. The law makers were not in a hurry, but towards the\r\n     last of the session they passed our bill, and you may be\r\n     sure there was great rejoicing in Cedar Rapids. On our\r\n     return the citizens gave us a grand banquet in Greene's\r\n     hotel, and we felt that we had at last secured a substantial\r\n     victory for our city, as in fact it was, for thenceforward\r\n     Marion could no longer be our rival. The cars came to Cedar\r\n     Rapids in the summer of 1859, just ten years after we had\r\n     held our first railroad meeting, and we felt at last that\r\n     hope had ended in fruition. An immense concourse greeted\r\n     their arrival from all parts of the surrounding country.\r\n     General D. N. Sprague, then mayor, welcomed the guests, and\r\n     the citizens threw open hospitable doors to all comers.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1840 to 1846 much work was going on in the thriving little town.\r\nGlass had already a small grist mill on McCloud's Run and a saw mill\r\nhad been started on Indian creek which furnished lumber till the saw\r\nmill on the Cedar river was completed. The labor on the dam was a big\r\nundertaking and took much time as the enterprising adventurers were not\r\nwell prepared to cope with so large an undertaking.\r\n\r\nMany settlers were coming constantly, all of them full of courage and\r\npleased with the location, which all proclaimed could not be improved\r\nupon. There were Alexander Ely, Joseph Greene, Homer Bishop, P. W.\r\nEarle, John Vardy, D. Fiddlar, A. Eddy, George Westlake, William Dwyer,\r\nJames Gunning, Charles Mulford, Isaac Cook, John Shearer, James Lewis,\r\nDr. S. M. Brice, and many others.\r\n\r\nChurches were also organized, such as the Methodist, in 1841, by Rev.\r\nHodges, and the Baptist the same year by Rev. G. E. Eberhart. The\r\nUnited Presbyterian church was organized by John Cunningham ten years\r\nlater. New settlers came and other church organizations were completed\r\nand small church buildings were erected by the members.\r\n\r\nThe following chatty reminiscences of pioneer times is from the\r\n_Republican_ of recent date:\r\n\r\n     \"'If two of us wanted to lunch together,' he said, 'we went\r\n     to a saloon and sat down over some black bread and a little\r\n     beer. Now you must stand up to drink your beer, and you may\r\n     eat nothing.'\r\n\r\n     \"In the old days the city and the county politicians met\r\n     here and talked over the political situation. The\r\n     professional men met on equal grounds. Now it is all\r\n     changed.\r\n\r\n     \"There were some interesting places in Cedar Rapids in those\r\n     old days. In the location where Mr. Armstrong is now about\r\n     to erect a fine business block there was an old German named\r\n     Moritz Hoffbeck. It was a sand hill then, but there was a\r\n     good cellar where Hoffbeck sold beer, gave away good lunches\r\n     and entertained the crowd. His good wife also served the\r\n     guests with good things to eat, cooked after her own\r\n     fashion. Here congregated the best business men of the town\r\n     after the day's business was over. They went home in the\r\n     best of spirits, but often it was rather late when they\r\n     went.\r\n\r\n     \"Some of the city's poets of that day composed a little poem\r\n     about Moritz which ran as follows:\r\n\r\n         \"Moritz Hoffbeck is my name,\r\n           Bavaria is my nation.\r\n         Cedar Rapids I dearly love,\r\n           For here I get my ration.\r\n\r\n     \"Another German, Sam Leunch, kept a place at Third avenue\r\n     and First street, which was for many years a meeting place\r\n     for farmers as well as city men. It also had a reputation\r\n     for its fine lunches.\r\n\r\n     \"Sych's place was on the present location of the Y. M. C. A.\r\n     This also was German and German dishes were one of its great\r\n     attractions.\r\n\r\n     \"Frank Simon had a restaurant where Stark's hotel is now\r\n     located. It was an eating house; also a drinking house. It\r\n     was noted in five counties for being the place to get the\r\n     best oysters in any style. The German fries have never been\r\n     excelled. When Simon died, Ben Springer married his widow.\r\n     He retired many years ago and sold the business to the\r\n     Starks.\r\n\r\n     \"Frank Mark was a Swede who kept a saloon where Denecke's\r\n     store is located, fronting on Second avenue. It was a small\r\n     place but it was always full for he served eatables and kept\r\n     private rooms for his city patrons who wished a quiet place\r\n     in which to talk things over.\r\n\r\n     \"Pollack's where Severa's store is now located, was the\r\n     Bohemian restaurant much sought for its good things to eat\r\n     and for the imported drinks which he kept for his best\r\n     friends.\r\n\r\n     \"Count Boshon kept a saloon down into prohibition times and\r\n     ran many saloons in various places. He was known as the King\r\n     of Bohemia and acted as though he might have been a count.\r\n     He imported the Philip Best beer from Milwaukee and stored a\r\n     car or two at a time in ice, and for this he obtained a\r\n     great reputation. Count Boshon was a chancellor and knew how\r\n     to secure the good will of prominent persons of the city and\r\n     of the county officials. He seemed to stand in with all. It\r\n     is said in his favor that while he may have violated the law\r\n     in some instance he tried to keep a decent place.\r\n\r\n     \"The young business men would take a Saturday off and go up\r\n     fishing or hunting or hire Elias Doty and his boat, the\r\n     'Climax,' and take a sail on the murky waters on the Red\r\n     Cedar, sometimes up, and now and then when the water was\r\n     high, down stream. Now all has changed.\r\n\r\n     \"In the olden times there were dances at the neighbors or\r\n     other old gatherings. All were common. No dress suits were\r\n     seen and there was no delay on account of lack of any\r\n     introduction.\r\n\r\n     \"Doctors would get together and tell stories, lawyers would\r\n     joke over their trials in court and in every way people were\r\n     on an equality and truly happy.\r\n\r\n     \"Then people did not devote all their time to making money.\r\n     They did not spend all the time in business. Young and old\r\n     had a better time of it, for they worked and played as well.\r\n     They were really content with the surroundings and with\r\n     their condition in life.\r\n\r\n     \"In winter time people got together and had a good time,\r\n     going skating or sleighing--on Christmas there were not so\r\n     many gifts as now, but what was given was with the best of\r\n     feeling. Another thing we have lost, and that is, the New\r\n     Year's day calls. Old and young, married and single, made\r\n     calls on this day every year.\r\n\r\n     \"It was a fine custom and it ought not to have been dropped.\r\n     Now people are too busy to call on their neighbors and they\r\n     seem to fear that society would not approve of it. In the\r\n     olden days no questions were asked about one's grandfather.\"\r\n\r\nThe old founders of Cedar Rapids were strong men in many ways. They\r\nwere real live wires, and frequently spent money and devoted much of\r\ntheir time to exploit new industries. Such men as Geo. Greene, N. B.\r\nBrown, David King, S. D. Carpenter, W. B. Mack, R. C. Rock, P. W.\r\nEarle, H. G. Angle, J. E. Sanford, the Daniels family, the Ely family,\r\nthe Weare family, the Bever family, and many others were men of rare\r\nintelligence, aggressive, enterprising, and wide awake, who came here\r\nto make a city at all hazards. They were true as steel to their\r\nconvictions, enthusiastic in booming their town, and the \"balance\r\nwheels\" in time of need which kept things going. Even when some of\r\nthese men lost heavily in the unfortunate steamboat ventures, in\r\nrailroad exploitations, in bridges, dams, factory properties, and in\r\nother ways, they never complained, although at times it made them \"men\r\nof sorrow and acquainted with grief.\" They never lost courage, and\r\nexpected things to turn, even when they looked the darkest, and won in\r\nthe end. The early pioneers were men keen to see an opportunity. They\r\nwere able to look ahead, and for this reason they perhaps hung on when\r\ntimes were hard and when enterprises failed to materialize. It was due\r\nto the enthusiastic spirit of those leading citizens that caused the\r\nLegare and Bryan families to invest $80,000 in gold in Linn county\r\nproperty. It was no doubt due to the up-to-date, progressive spirit of\r\nthose citizens that led S. C. Bever to bring $30,000 in gold, which was\r\ninvested mostly in city property in Cedar Rapids in the early '50s. It\r\nwas no doubt due to the keenness of mind of the late Judge Greene, that\r\nJohn T. Waterhouse in an early day came to Cedar Rapids and invested\r\nmuch money in choice corner lots on which he erected, for that time,\r\nmodern business blocks. But outside of a few men, most of the early\r\npioneers came to the county without any means. These acquired in the\r\ncourse of a few years, large holdings which have since doubled in value\r\nseveral times. Few, if any, who invested in real estate in Cedar Rapids\r\nand Linn county in an early day and who had foresight enough to hold on\r\nto it, ever lost anything on such investments. Values have gradually\r\nincreased until corner lots which sold for $10 in the early '40s in\r\nCedar Rapids, have now a value of from $2,000 to $10,000, and lands in\r\nand around the city which were disposed of at $5 to $10 an acre, have\r\nsold at from $250 to $500 an acre, and even higher.\r\n\r\nThe settlement in Linn county was an event of more or less importance,\r\nfor it was the last stand of the \"free booters,\" and the last rush for\r\ncheap land in the Mississippi valley. The citizens came at an opportune\r\ntime and took up the cheap lands, which soon rose in value. While\r\nduring the panic of 1857, many of the farmers were unable to pay taxes\r\non their farms and the value of farm produce was very low, yet they\r\nmanaged to get through. The panic of 1873 was not so disastrous on the\r\nfarmers of Iowa, because by that time they had acquired more property\r\nand could afford to hold their stuff longer than in the panic of 1857.\r\nThe land values stood still for awhile, but soon they began to move\r\nagain and the farmer who had paid for an eighty-acre strip of land\r\ngenerally purchased another eighty or two, as he had plenty of help and\r\nthe banks were willing to loan him the money. This land has more than\r\ndoubled in the past twenty years, but the value of a season's crop now,\r\nas compared to forty years ago, has also more than doubled.\r\n\r\nElias Doty, the son of an old pioneer, contributes the following items\r\nregarding Westport:\r\n\r\n     \"The first squatter town in Linn county was Westport,\r\n     situated on the east bank of the Cedar river, near a spring\r\n     three-fourths of a mile below the mouth of Indian creek. In\r\n     1845 its buildings consisted of one double log cabin, one\r\n     frame dwelling, one frame storehouse, and one frame grain\r\n     elevator. My father occupied the storehouse as a pottery,\r\n     where he made earthenware. The elevator was owned by Robert\r\n     Holmes and occupied by H. G. Higley and Lawson Daniels, who\r\n     bought wheat and built flatboats to float it to the St.\r\n     Louis market. Our family were the only dwellers at the town\r\n     at that time. Higley and Daniels boarded with us. They built\r\n     their boats bottom up and when completed turned them over.\r\n\r\n     \"Jacob Leabo lived a half mile below us, and Hiram Deem a\r\n     half mile above us. I. W. Carroll and C. C. Cook lived at\r\n     Dairy Dale, where they had started a brick kiln, which was\r\n     the first in the county so far as I know. The first lime\r\n     kiln was at Westport, where John Henry burned lime to\r\n     plaster the houses of the town. The saw mill of the county\r\n     at that time was near Bertram. It was started by my uncle,\r\n     Elias Doty, who was killed at its raising in 1841. It was\r\n     finished by James Briney.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HOTELS IN CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nWhile the Shepherd Tavern was the first place where strangers could be\r\nentertained in Cedar Rapids, it was not long till several hotels were\r\nstarted. \"It has always been a hotel town,\" said an old settler, \"for\r\nthe reason that when people came here they liked it so well that they\r\ndid not care to move and they stayed at the tavern as long as money and\r\ncredit held out.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Young, who held a claim near Shepherd, erected a small house on\r\nFourth avenue close to the river, which became known as the \"Astor\r\nHouse.\" This was a double log house, 18×26, and one story high,\r\naccording to the testimony of Robert Ellis, George R. Carroll, and\r\nothers. This building had several additions built to it during the next\r\nfive years. A Mr. Verbeck, a native of Vermont, was one of the early\r\nlandlords. This house was occupied by J. L. Shearer, John Weare, James\r\nHamilton, and several other well known pioneer families. The\r\nListebargers kept a sort of hotel near the Sinclair ice houses in\r\n1839-40, and here Robert Ellis and several other unmarried men boarded.\r\nThe Listebargers did not keep strangers, only regular boarders.\r\n\r\nWm. Dwyer erected a real up-to-date hotel in 1847, as it was said there\r\nwas a demand for such a building. It received the name of the Union\r\nHouse, with Jas. Gunning as the first landlord. It was located on Third\r\navenue and Third street, near the present site of the Montrose Hotel.\r\nIt was well spoken of and much patronized. The building was destroyed\r\nby fire in 1865. The American House and Greene's Hotel, both on First\r\nstreet, were well known places, sought by the traveling public.\r\nGreene's Hotel was for years one of the leading hotels in Iowa, a\r\nfour-story building on the corner of First avenue and First street\r\nwhere political rallies were held and banquets were served, and where\r\nballs occurred during the winter seasons.\r\n\r\nThe old Southern or Brown's Hotel was for many years one of the leading\r\nhotels. It is still operated under the name of Gorman's Hotel. The old\r\nEmpire House was another hotel which in the early fifties was a place\r\nmuch frequented by the commercial traveler. It stood on the corner of\r\nThird avenue and Second street. Johnson's Hotel, on the west side,\r\nformerly Kingston Hotel, was also a well known place of entertainment.\r\nOn the site of what is now the Cedar Rapids House there was operated\r\nfor many years a popular little hotel which was always full to\r\noverflowing. One of the old clerks here used to reply to the fellow who\r\nasked if they were full, \"The clerk is, but the house never, come in.\"\r\nMany of the pioneer travelers, who wanted to cross Dave King's ferry,\r\ncame to stay over night at this place. The river traffic increased\r\nhotel trade, so did the gold craze in California, but in 1859, when the\r\nrailroads reached Cedar Rapids, every other home was turned into a\r\nrooming house to accommodate the traveling public.\r\n\r\nThe Grand, the Clifton, Palace Hotel, the Pullman, were for years busy\r\nplaces, till the Delevan, the Allison, and the Montrose were built.\r\n\r\nA city is largely known by its hotels, as the word is generally passed\r\nalong by the traveling men. Cedar Rapids stands well in the state as a\r\nhotel center.\r\n\r\nIn the Wolfe Directory for 1868 the following hotels are given Cedar\r\nRapids: American House, G. E. Cheny; Chicago House, Nick Pitting;\r\nDubuque House, Anton Christle; Eagle Hotel, R. E. Baldwin; Empire\r\nHouse, J. L. Peak; Valley City House, Harvey & Sherund; Kingston Hotel,\r\nWilliam Friis; Dubuque House; National Hotel, Humphrey & Bean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF ZOO IN BEVER PARK, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCENE IN BEVER PARK, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS IN 1856\r\n\r\nFrom 1850 to 1860 Cedar Rapids had a marvelous growth, despite the\r\npanic of 1857 which wiped out some of the fortunes of those who had\r\ninvested heavily in wild lands and who had engaged in banking. The\r\n_Voice of Iowa_, a local newspaper, has the following to say of the\r\nwealth of the city's business enterprises:\r\n\r\n     Flouring mills, four; planing mills, sash, doors and blinds,\r\n     two; cooper, one; wagon and carriage factories, five; iron\r\n     foundry, one; cabinet and chair factories, two; plow\r\n     factories, three; boot and shoe factories, three; saddle and\r\n     harness factories, three; tin, copper and sheet iron\r\n     workers, four; woolen factory, one; brick yards, five; farm\r\n     implement factories, two; merchant tailors, two;\r\n     woodworking, two; newspapers, three; brick machine factory,\r\n     one; grocery and provision stores, eight; dry goods,\r\n     fifteen; clothing, five; drug stores, four; jewelers, two;\r\n     hardware, four; book stores, two; book bindery, one; liquor\r\n     and cigars, six; public halls, five; hotels, five; churches,\r\n     four; lumber yards, four; bakery, one; banks, three; barber,\r\n     one; public reading room, one. The same issue of the paper\r\n     cites that the town should have a pork packing plant as well\r\n     as a paper mill. It took a long time before the T. M.\r\n     Sinclair Company's plant became an assured reality, which\r\n     has become in time such a factor in the upbuilding of Cedar\r\n     Rapids and Linn county.\r\n\r\nThe following list of business firms in Cedar Rapids in 1856 is of\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n     Dry Goods Stores--Shattuck & Dewey, Commercial street; L.\r\n     Daniels & Co., Commercial street; C.

Stone on what constituted the present site of\r\n     Cedar Rapids. This was not the first claim made, however, as\r\n     John Mann, Esq., had the honor of being the first settler in\r\n     the county, having located at Pine Grove in the early part\r\n     of the same year.\r\n\r\n     \"The attention of the early pioneers being drawn to the\r\n     manufacturing resources of the county, the present site was\r\n     early chosen as most suitable for a city, as the swift\r\n     current of the river at this place would afford, in all\r\n     probability, a valuable and extensive water-power. In 1841\r\n     the town was laid out, and within a short time thereafter\r\n     the improvement of the water-power was commenced. The land\r\n     lying along the margin of the river and commanding the\r\n     water privileges was soon purchased by Messrs. N. B. Brown,\r\n     George Greene, H. W. Gray, and others, who early commenced\r\n     the construction of the dam and the building of those mills\r\n     and manufactories which have since been the pride of the\r\n     city and which have contributed so much to its permanent\r\n     growth and development.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"N. B. Brown, Esq., has added an attractive feature to the\r\n     city by erecting a costly and elegant hotel on North\r\n     Commercial street, which, when finished, will be one of the\r\n     finest west of Chicago. In addition to these, the building\r\n     of the mammoth machine shops of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids\r\n     and Minnesota R. R. Company is shortly contemplated. This\r\n     will involve an expense of several hundred thousand dollars,\r\n     for which purpose fifty thousand dollars have been\r\n     appropriated to the company by this city and township.\r\n\r\n     \"... As to educational interests Cedar Rapids has maintained\r\n     a high position among her sister cities of the state. It is\r\n     generally conceded that Iowa is the banner state of the\r\n     Union, regarding her system of free schools and the\r\n     advantages derived therefrom. This city has no less than\r\n     thirty-five thousand dollars in school buildings, including\r\n     the one recently built in West Cedar Rapids. The schools are\r\n     classified and graded under the latest improved system, and\r\n     are presided over by an able corps of teachers, chosen with\r\n     special reference to their attainments and adaptation to\r\n     impart instruction. James E. Harlan has at present the\r\n     entire superintendence of the schools, and by his efficiency\r\n     he is maintaining the high reputation which the schools have\r\n     before sustained. Over thirteen hundred pupils are in\r\n     constant attendance, and the number is yearly increasing.\r\n\r\n     \"... The Young Men's Christian Association deserves even\r\n     more than a passing notice. The rooms of the Association are\r\n     in Mansfield's Block, over the postoffice, and are opened\r\n     each morning and evening through the week.\r\n\r\n     \"... The Young Men's Library Association is also a pleasant\r\n     feature of the city. The enterprise has established a choice\r\n     and well selected library, consisting of historic,\r\n     scientific, poetic and biographic works, chosen from the\r\n     best authors in the land. The library rooms are in charge of\r\n     Miss Mary Thompson, a lady of rare grace and culture, who\r\n     takes delight in entertaining her guests and exhibiting the\r\n     many works of interest that adorn the shelves of her\r\n     library.\r\n\r\n     \"... The social, moral and religious elements blend here in\r\n     sweet harmony, and much of the refinement and culture\r\n     witnessed in eastern cities and in eastern society is\r\n     equally exhibited here; hence to those wishing to settle in\r\n     a place combining the advantages of church, schools and\r\n     refined society, as well as a place of good business\r\n     facilities will find Cedar Rapids a desirable city in which\r\n     to locate. We venture the assertion that Cedar Rapids, in\r\n     the future as in the past, is destined to excel, in wealth\r\n     and numbers, her neighboring rivals, and evermore sit as\r\n     queen in the rich valley she so beautifully adorns.\"\r\n\r\nThe following obituary appeared in the Cedar Rapids _Gazette_ in March,\r\n1909, and gives a sketch of a person who had passed through much of\r\nwhat is now the history of a thriving city, and is for that reason made\r\npart of the history of the county. Mrs. Brown was at her death the\r\nwidow of one of the foremost men who ever lived in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\n     \"Susan Emery, daughter of Nathan Emery and Cornelia\r\n     Broadhead, his wife, was born August 19, 1824, at Dingman's\r\n     Ferry, Pike county, Pennsylvania, and died March 4, 1909, at\r\n     Cedar Rapids, Iowa, thus having lived 84 years, 6 months and\r\n     15 days, a period of time much longer than the average\r\n     allotted to mankind. A woman in her younger days of a noble,\r\n     perhaps an imperious presence, strong in mental and physical\r\n     make-up; self-reliant and unswerving in the object sought\r\n     to be attained by her. Strong in likes and dislikes, no\r\n     truer, more loyal friend among mankind than she. She came of\r\n     a long-lived, stubborn warrior race. Through her mother,\r\n     Cornelia Broadhead, she was descended from Daniel Broadhead,\r\n     a Yorkshire Englishman, a captain of Grenadiers, who fought\r\n     for Charles the Second during the civil wars of England, and\r\n     by him was commissioned to serve under Colonel Nicholls in\r\n     the expedition to the new world to wrest New Netherlands\r\n     from the Dutch, that the same might become a new world\r\n     kingdom for James, duke of York, brother to the king.\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Broadhead was made military governor of a portion\r\n     of New Netherlands, with his headquarters at the old Indian\r\n     town of Wiltwyck, called by the Hollanders Esophus and after\r\n     the English occupation named and is still known as Kingston,\r\n     in the state of New York. Captain Broadhead died in 1670. A\r\n     grandson, Daniel by name, in 1733 migrated through the\r\n     wilderness, down through the Jerseys to the water gap and\r\n     located there. He with his sons refused to be driven out of\r\n     the country and off his possessions by the savages during\r\n     the Indian wars and fought for what they considered their\r\n     own and won out. From this Daniel were descended three\r\n     revolutionary soldiers--General Daniel Broadhead, a noted\r\n     Indian fighter and close friend of George Washington; Luke\r\n     Broadhead, a captain and friend of LaFayette, and Garret\r\n     Broadhead, a captain. John Romeyn Broadhead, the historian,\r\n     was of this family of Broadheads. From this it will be seen\r\n     that Susan Brown came from no mean stock. In her younger\r\n     days she was known to be generous and charitable to any\r\n     worthy poor. Her giving was of the quiet and unostentatious\r\n     kind, and to a considerable extent. This trait of character\r\n     remained with her through her old age. She was a woman of\r\n     strict integrity, spotless purity, and the world and\r\n     community in which she lived was undoubtedly the gainer for\r\n     her having lived in it. In 1852 she was married to her\r\n     kinsman, Nicholas Broadhead Brown (a pioneer of 1840),\r\n     coming immediately with her husband and sister, Mrs. Hannah\r\n     E. Higley, to Cedar Rapids and has remained here\r\n     continuously from that time, thus making her, with possibly\r\n     one or two exceptions, at the time of her death, the oldest\r\n     continuous resident of this city. In laying the foundation\r\n     and the early upbuilding of this city were a number of\r\n     potent and conspicuous men and women, such as George Greene,\r\n     Alexander Ely, Addison Daniels, and others, but none more so\r\n     than Nicholas B. Brown and his wife Susan.\"\r\n\r\nIt is entirely proper to make some mention in these pages of Captain\r\nJoshua John Snouffer, who came to Cedar Rapids in 1852 when the city\r\ncontained less than 400 people. He too had an intimate knowledge of\r\nwhat it meant to be a pioneer.\r\n\r\nCaptain Snouffer was born in Maryland February 24, 1825, and though he\r\nwas a loyal citizen of Iowa he never ceased to love his native state,\r\nnor did he ever forget its history, its traditions, and its people. He\r\nentered the Mexican war where he was wounded in the head on the field\r\nof battle on November 9, 1847. This wound troubled him all the\r\nremaining days of his life. At the time he was wounded he was first\r\nsergeant of a company of dragoons, and on several occasions had\r\ncommanded a company.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the firm of W. D. Watrous & Company he was closely\r\nidentified with the milling industry of Cedar Rapids. He superintended\r\nthe erection of \"the brick mill\" in 1875. With J. J. Child he was the\r\njoint author of the city's charter. He took an active part in the\r\nbuilding of the Iowa & Nebraska Railroad, now the Northwestern. He was\r\na prime mover in establishing the water works, and was one of those who\r\ngave the city its first street railway. At various times he was a\r\nmember of the city government both as alderman and mayor. He was a\r\nskilled parliamentarian, and an honest man in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDAR RAPIDS TODAY\r\n\r\nW. I. Endicott, in _The Saturday Record_, July 10, 1909:\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids has had a civic existence since January 15, 1849, on which\r\ndate a town charter was adopted and town officers elected. In 1856, a\r\nnew city charter was granted by the legislature and under that charter\r\nthe affairs of the city were conducted until April 6, 1908, when the\r\ncharter was abandoned and the city went under what is known as the\r\n\"Commission Plan.\" Under the provisions of this law all ward lines and\r\ndivisions were abolished and five men--a mayor and four councilmen or\r\ncommissioners are elected at large. In the hands of these five men is\r\nplaced all responsibility for the appointment of the entire city\r\nofficial staff and the management of city affairs.\r\n\r\nThe new plan is working in a most satisfactory manner in Cedar Rapids\r\nand many things are being accomplished under it that were impossible of\r\naccomplishment under the old ward system. The improvements under way\r\nare all planned with a view to actual necessity and the harmonious\r\nbuilding up of the city in all its sections. Modern business methods\r\nare in use in the conduct of the city's affairs and unwise or\r\nextravagant expenditure of the public money is not permitted. The\r\ncouncil meets nearly every day and the citizen who has business to\r\ntransact with the council is given instant hearing and attention.\r\n\r\nUnder the law, the mayor is paid a salary of $2,500 and each of the\r\ncouncilmen $1,800 annually, and they devote full time and attention to\r\nthe work of the city. The city's business is divided into departments\r\nand each man is in charge of and responsible for a certain department.\r\nThe mayor is head of the department of Public Affairs and as such,\r\nexercises a general supervision over all phases of the city business.\r\nThen there are the departments of Accounts and Finances, the department\r\nof Public Safety, the department of Streets and Public Improvements,\r\nand the department of Parks and Public Property. The men elected have\r\nfirst to be successful in a wide open primary and then in the regular\r\ncity election secure a majority of all the votes cast. In the election\r\nof 1908 there were 48 candidates for councilman and nine candidates for\r\nmayor on the primary ballot. From these names the two who received the\r\nhighest number of votes for mayor and the eight who received the\r\nhighest number of votes for councilman were declared the nominees and\r\ntheir names appeared on the ballot at the regular election, the names\r\nappearing in alphabetical order on both the primary and regular\r\nelection ballots, and without any party or other designation.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the council accomplished the sale of the old city hall site and\r\nthe purchase of May's Island for park and public buildings purposes.\r\nThis island has an area of about six acres, and lying in the Cedar\r\nriver in the very center of the city, forms an ideal place for a civic\r\ncenter. The city offices are now occupying temporary quarters on the\r\nisland and as rapidly as possible the low places are being filled with\r\ndirt from the various excavations for business buildings, and from\r\nother sources, so that what was once a municipal disgrace, is being\r\nrapidly transformed into a place of beauty, to say nothing of forever\r\nsetting at rest any possibility of divisive strife between the two\r\nsides of the river.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CITY'S ASSETS\r\n\r\nThe public improvements of the city of Cedar Rapids represent\r\nexpenditures running into the millions of dollars. Few cities of like\r\nsize are so thoroughly or excellently paved. On the first of January,\r\n1909, the city had three miles of asphalt, twenty miles of brick, and\r\nfive miles of macadam paving, or a total of twenty-eight miles. There\r\nare now under construction, or already completed on contracts carried\r\nover from 1908, two miles of brick and one mile of tar treated macadam,\r\ngiving Cedar Rapids at the present time thirty-one miles of paving.\r\nThe contracts let for 1909 will add more than five miles to that total,\r\nso the city will have approximately thirty-six miles of paving at the\r\nend of the present year.\r\n\r\nSidewalks are practically all of cement construction and laid under\r\ncity supervision. On January 1, 1909, there were more than 102 miles of\r\nwalk in the city, and of this more than ninety-six miles were of\r\ncement, nearly four miles of brick or stone and only about two miles of\r\nwooden construction. The contracts let for this season will represent\r\nthe construction of about eight miles of walks, giving the city a total\r\nof 110 miles of sidewalks.\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids has two systems of sewers, sanitary and storm water. Some\r\nof the storm water sewers are of large size, being seven feet in\r\ndiameter, and one--the Vinton ditch sewer, is even larger.\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids has an excellent fire department, equipped with the best\r\nof apparatus. There are five stations--one central station and four\r\noutlying hose houses.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of parks the city has made a most promising start. There\r\nare now in the city twenty-eight parks, counting large and small and\r\nnot including any street parkways. Of this number Bever Park, Ellis\r\nPark, Daniels Park, May's Island Park, Riverside Park, and Whittam Park\r\nare considerable tracts, while George Greene Square, opposite the union\r\nstation, with its beautiful display of flowers and rich green lawn, is\r\none of the show spots of the city. Bever Park, the largest of the\r\nparks, in the woods to the east of the city, was the gift of James L.\r\nBever, George W. Bever, and John B. Bever, as a memorial to their\r\nfather, Sampson C. Bever, who was one of the pioneers of the city.\r\nBever Park is flanked one side by picturesque Vernon Heights and on the\r\nother by beautiful Ridgewood, forming an almost continuous park of\r\ngreat extent and beauty. Daniels Park is the newest of the city parks.\r\nIt is located on the Old Marion Road and has been transformed into a\r\nbeautiful floral park, with well-arranged walks and driveways.\r\nRiverside Park is the close-in park, being located on the bank of the\r\nriver south of Eleventh avenue, and this has been made a play park,\r\nwith plenty of out-door gymnasium apparatus for the children and young\r\npeople. Ellis Park, located on the river bank above the city, is one of\r\nthe most beautiful and attractive of all the parks, and when adequate\r\nmeans of reaching it are installed, it will without question be one of\r\nthe most popular parks in the city. The river with its excellent\r\nboating facilities, gives a charm to Ellis Park that is denied the\r\nother breathing places of the city. The city of Cedar Rapids is\r\nspending more than twenty thousand dollars each year on its park\r\nsystem, and it is money well spent. There are about two hundred acres\r\nin the park system, and a conservative value of the park grounds and\r\nimprovements is well over $300,000.\r\n\r\nThe Free Public Library is a most valuable asset to the city and aside\r\nfrom the unmeasurable good done in the dissemination of knowledge,\r\nrepresents a money investment of well toward $150,000. The building\r\nproper was the gift of Mr. Carnegie and cost $75,000, the grounds and\r\nother items and the contents of the library will add another $75,000 to\r\nthe valuation. It is supported by a city tax and costs about $12,000\r\nper year to operate. Its affairs are in charge of a board of trustees,\r\nappointed by the council.\r\n\r\nThe city owns and maintains five bridges across the Cedar river. Of\r\nthese bridges four are of steel construction and one--the Second avenue\r\nbridge--is a magnificent reinforced concrete bridge of Melan arch\r\ndesign. This bridge is one of the best and most attractive in the\r\nmiddle west. Its cost was more than $100,000.\r\n\r\n[The city contracted in 1909-10 a new concrete bridge to replace the\r\nold steel bridge on Sixteenth avenue at a cost of $80,000. It is 40\r\nfeet wide and 2,600 feet long, and was opened for traffic January,\r\n1910. A new concrete bridge will be contracted in 1911 at Third avenue\r\nto replace one of the oldest in the city.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIXTEENTH AVENUE BRIDGE, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST STREET, CORNER SECOND AVENUE, IN 1869]\r\n\r\nThe city water works are owned by the city of Cedar Rapids, and are\r\nmanaged by three trustees appointed by the council. The plant was\r\npurchased from the water company July 1, 1903, at an agreed price of\r\n$473,000. Of this amount, $23,000 was paid in cash and the remainder\r\nwas put in the form of bonds. In the past six years $158,000 of these\r\nbonds have been retired, leaving a net indebtedness against the water\r\nplant of $315,000. The net earnings of the plant from July 1, 1903, to\r\nJuly 1, 1908, were $79,952.30, and for the year ending July 1, 1909,\r\nwere almost $25,000. In addition the city gets free hydrant rental and\r\nfire protection. A conservative inventory of the water plant will show\r\na valuation of well over $600,000 at the present time. The water is\r\ntaken from large wells on an island in the Cedar river belonging to the\r\ncity and located some distance above the C. & N. W. bridge. It is\r\nfiltered by the Jewell system and is forced through the mains by large\r\npumps. There are three of these pumps in use, one of two million\r\ngallons daily capacity, one of three million gallons capacity and one\r\nof five million gallons capacity. The necessary power is supplied by\r\ntwo water tube boilers of 350 horsepower each, and three tubular\r\nboilers of 70 horsepower each. The filter system has a capacity of\r\nthree million gallons per day, and an additional reservoir for the\r\nfilter is now under construction. There are at the present time 390\r\nfire hydrants and an excellent and satisfactory fire pressure is\r\nmaintained for all fire alarms. A loop of twelve-inch mains encircles\r\nthe business district and this loop is supplied by a twenty-inch main\r\ndirect from the pumps, giving the business section a fire protection\r\nunexcelled by that of any city in the west.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nUp to 1849 the village of Cedar Rapids had no formal organization. It\r\nwas simply a township. But the legislature of 1849 granted a town\r\ncharter and for the next decade the community throve apace. It was\r\nduring this period of years that Cedar Rapids strove for, and secured,\r\nits first line of railway. In the fifties the railway lines to the west\r\nleft the bank of the Mississippi and pushed their way out into the\r\nfertile prairies of Iowa. Among these lines was one known as the\r\nChicago, Iowa and Nebraska, and its purpose was to construct a line of\r\nrailway from Clinton, across Iowa, to some point on the Missouri river.\r\n\r\nAmong Cedar Rapids men who were prominently identified with the\r\nenterprise and were on the board of directors were John Weare, Jr.,\r\nWilliam Greene, H. G. Angle and S. C. Bever. The company was organized\r\nin 1856, but it was not until June, 1859, that the line was completed\r\nfrom Clinton to Cedar Rapids, a distance of a little over eighty miles,\r\nand train service established between the two towns.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the coming of the railroad, communication with the outside\r\nworld was maintained by means of stage lines; Dubuque, Clinton,\r\nDavenport, Muscatine, Iowa City, and Waterloo being reached by that\r\nmethod. Freight and supplies were brought in by wagon, though in the\r\nearly days there was some steamboat traffic on the Cedar river as far\r\nas Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nIt required hard work, and plenty of it, to get that first new line of\r\nrailway into Cedar Rapids. Marion, the old, substantial town and the\r\ncounty seat, wanted the road--and came pretty near getting it, too. The\r\nnext move in railway construction work for the community was the\r\nextension of the new line west, on its way to the Missouri river, a\r\nline which is today the main artery of the Chicago & Northwestern\r\nsystem, forming an important part of the great highway of steel\r\nconnecting the Atlantic and Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe original promoters of the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railway,\r\nliving in Cedar Rapids, were anxious that that company should build a\r\nbranch line up the Cedar valley from this point, and thus tap the rich\r\nand rapidly growing territory lying to the northwest of Cedar Rapids.\r\nBut the company had no time or money with which to build side lines or\r\nbranches. Its objective point was the Missouri river and the great\r\nbeyond. So Judge George Greene, S. L. Dows, and other prominent public\r\nspirited men took up the task of constructing a road from Cedar Rapids\r\nto Vinton and Waterloo. Burlington capitalists and promoters joined in\r\nthe work of extending the line from Cedar Rapids southeast to\r\nBurlington, and in a few years the embryo of what later became the\r\nBurlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern, the \"Cedar Rapids route,\" with its\r\nlines radiating from Cedar Rapids to Clinton, Muscatine, Burlington,\r\nWhat Cheer, Iowa City, Sioux Falls, Watertown, Worthington, Forest\r\nCity, Albert Lea, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Decorah, was in existence.\r\nThe shops, roundhouses and general offices of the road were located in\r\nCedar Rapids, and everybody took pride and a personal interest in\r\nspeaking of the institution as the \"Home Road.\" The absorption of the\r\nBurlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern by the great Rock Island system,\r\nthus giving Cedar Rapids direct connections with all stations on that\r\nroad, is a matter so recent as to be hardly history as yet. This change\r\nhas been more in name than in reality. The shops are maintained, as in\r\nyears past. An even larger army of trainmen and operative employes make\r\nCedar Rapids their home, and the general offices for the northern\r\ndistrict make use of the general office building constructed by the\r\nBurlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railway Co.\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids' third railway enterprise was the securing of the Dubuque\r\n& Southwestern, locally known as the \"Slough Shore,\" from the manner of\r\nits entrance into the town. This railway was built and operated by the\r\nFarleys, father and sons, of Dubuque, and for many years, with its\r\nconnection with the Illinois Central at Farley, maintained the only\r\nline of direct communication between Dubuque and Cedar Rapids. In the\r\nearly days some very peculiar railroading was done on the Farley line,\r\nand the incidents and happenings, if gathered together, would make an\r\nextended volume.\r\n\r\nThe Dubuque and Southwestern is now a part of the Chicago, Milwaukee &\r\nSt. Paul system, and over its tracks trains now run to Chicago, Omaha,\r\nKansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Paul, as well as to the original\r\nsleepy little terminus of Farley.\r\n\r\nThe last steam road to enter Cedar Rapids was the Illinois Central, a\r\nline being constructed from Manchester by the late S. L. Dows. This\r\nline opens up to the shippers and business men of Cedar Rapids direct\r\nconnections with the Illinois Central, and is of peculiar value in the\r\ntraffic in southern and tropical fruits and commodities which come by\r\nwater to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMore recently the interurban between Cedar Rapids and Iowa City has\r\nbeen constructed, and with its hourly service it has won a business\r\nwhich makes certain the building of other and equally as promising\r\nlines in the near future.\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids of 1909, from a railroad point of view, is the traffic\r\npivot of the middle west. Centering here are four of the largest\r\nrailway systems of the country--the Chicago & Northwestern, the\r\nChicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the Rock Island, and the Illinois\r\nCentral. From Cedar Rapids direct lines radiate to Chicago, Peoria, St.\r\nLouis, Kansas City, St. Joseph, Council Bluffs, Omaha, Sioux City,\r\nSioux Falls, Watertown, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Milwaukee, the total\r\nmileage of the lines entering Cedar Rapids being about 35,000 miles.\r\nDirect service is maintained between Cedar Rapids and nearly 1,750\r\nstations in Iowa, to say nothing of the thousands of stations in other\r\nand surrounding states reached by direct train service from this city.\r\nMore than 225 railway and interurban trains arrive in or depart from\r\nCedar Rapids daily. Approximately 80,000 carloads of freight are\r\nhandled annually. The freight earnings are about $3,500,000 and the\r\npassenger receipts are about $1,200,000 each year. Three express\r\ncompanies, the American, the United States, and the Wells-Fargo,\r\nmaintain offices in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the future of Cedar Rapids as a railroad, manufacturing and\r\ndistributing center, the railroads have all been expending vast sums of\r\nmoney in the past few years in the acquisition of property for\r\nterminal purposes. The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the Illinois\r\nCentral, and the Rock Island now control absolutely the entire section\r\nof the city lying between Fifth and Ninth avenues, the river and Third\r\nstreet, and it is only fair to presume that the four blocks between\r\nThird and Fourth streets and Fifth and Ninth avenues will also be\r\ndevoted exclusively to railway purposes. South of the city, along the\r\nriver bank, the Chicago & Northwestern is expending thousands of\r\ndollars in the filling in of a large section of low land and old river\r\nbed, and on this made ground new and enlarged terminals and switch\r\nyards will be built.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific is now engaged in the construction\r\nof its new terminals and freight depot on the blocks lying between\r\nSecond and Third streets and Fifth and Ninth avenues, and when\r\ncompleted these terminals and depot will be ample for the accommodation\r\nof a freight business of a city of hundreds of thousands of population.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of passenger travel the city is well accommodated in the\r\ntwo depots, both on Fourth street, one occupied by the Chicago &\r\nNorthwestern and the Rock Island, and known as the Union station, and\r\nthe other occupied jointly by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul and the\r\nIllinois Central lines.\r\n\r\nMention must also be made of the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City interurban\r\nline, which maintains an excellent hourly service between the two\r\ncities. This line of road is the pioneer in the interurban field for\r\nthe city, if the line to Marion be excepted, but is proving daily more\r\nand more popular and its business is increasing in such a measure that\r\nthe building of additional lines of like character is only a question\r\nof the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING\r\n\r\nFrom the days of its very earliest beginnings the people of Cedar\r\nRapids have paid especial attention to the manufacturing industry. A\r\nlarge part of those who settled in Cedar Rapids came from the east\r\nwhere manufacturing leads all other industries and it is but natural\r\nthat they should embark in their new home in those lines with which\r\nthey were familiar. The papers and records of the early days tell of a\r\nlong line of enterprises that have come and gone. There were flour\r\nmills, woolen mills, implement works, engine factories, wagon\r\nfactories, oil mills--the list is a long and interesting one to the\r\ndelver into local history.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the railways, opening up markets for the\r\nmanufactured products and affording means of collecting and bringing in\r\nthe raw material, the manufacturing side of Cedar Rapids' activities\r\nhas grown apace, until today Cedar Rapids, although not the largest of\r\nIowa cities, leads them all in the amount of manufactured goods\r\nproduced. In 1908 the total ran to nearly if not quite $22,000,000, and\r\nthe output for 1909 will far exceed that great figure. There are now\r\nnearly 100 manufacturing institutions in Cedar Rapids, employing nearly\r\n4,500 hands and paying more than $3,000,000 annually in wages.\r\n\r\nMany of our manufacturing institutions are of many years' standing. The\r\ngreat mill of the Quaker Oats Company, the largest milling plant in the\r\nworld, was originally established years ago as an oat meal mill by\r\nGeorge Douglas and Robert Stuart, two thrifty and persevering Scotchmen\r\nto whose industry and far-sightedness is due the fact that at least the\r\nfirst course of the world's breakfast (after fruit) comes from Cedar\r\nRapids. The great packing plant of T. M. Sinclair & Co., Ltd., giving\r\nemployment to 1,200 employees and sending its products to all parts of\r\nthe world, has done more to advertise Cedar Rapids than any other one\r\nagency. It was established by T. M. Sinclair, a young man from Belfast,\r\nand from its modest beginning many years ago it has become a plant\r\nrepresenting an investment of millions and an ability to supply at\r\nleast a large portion of the second course of the world's breakfast.\r\nThen there is the big starch works of Douglas & Co., the largest\r\nindependent starch plant in the country--a plant where corn by the\r\ntrain load is daily transformed into starch and gluten feed. In smaller\r\ninstitutions note must be made of the Anchor Mill Co. and the T. G.\r\nWhite Cereal Co., with their specialties in flour and wheat flakes.\r\nWhile on the subject of cereals, note should be taken of the big\r\nelevators and cleaning houses of the Cedar Rapids Grain Co., the\r\nClinton Grain Co., Jackson Grain Co., and the Wells-Hord Grain Co.\r\nWithout doubt, the name \"Cereal City\" which has been applied to Cedar\r\nRapids is not a misnomer.\r\n\r\nIn other lines Cedar Rapids leads as well as in those involving the\r\nconversion of the native products of agricultural Iowa. This city with\r\nits three great pump companies, the Cedar Rapids Pump Co., the Chandler\r\nPump Co., and the Iowa Windmill and Pump Co., control the pump,\r\nwindmill, iron pipe and plumbing supply business of the middle west.\r\nWhile the collateral lines covered by the Dearborn Brass Co., the Iowa\r\nRadiator Co., the Tokheim Manufacturing Co., the Vernier Manufacturing\r\nCo., the Smith-Talbott Co., and others add materially to the leadership\r\nof Cedar Rapids in these departments.\r\n\r\nThe Denning Fence works places Cedar Rapids in a leading position in\r\nthe fence manufacturing business. The Perfection Manufacturing Co., the\r\nHawkeye Skirt and Garment Co., the Welch-Cook Co., and the\r\nClark-MacDanel Co., give Cedar Rapids a high position in the business\r\nof manufacturing clothing for both men and women that is not suspected,\r\neven by some of the best posted people in the city. Then there are\r\nother lines of manufacture. The J. G. Cherry Co., with their line of\r\ndairy and creamery supplies; the Cedar Rapids Sash and Door Co., the\r\nWilliams & Hunting Co., and the Disbrow Sash and Door Co., with their\r\nbig wood working plants; the various furniture factories, the cement\r\nand sand-lime brick plants; the big printing plants, for printing is a\r\nmost important industry in Cedar Rapids; in short, the list is endless\r\nand as this is not a directory of the manufacturing industries of Cedar\r\nRapids, further individual mention will have to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhat is manufactured in Cedar Rapids? The list is a long and mixed one.\r\nIt comprehends all kinds of breakfast foods, flour, starch, gluten\r\nfeed, all kinds of packing house products, woven wire fence, candy, ice\r\ncream, pumps, iron pipe, windmills, plumbers' supplies, steam heating\r\nplants, machinery of all kinds, stone and ore crushers, hot air\r\nfurnaces, cornices, bank, store and office fixtures, camp and lawn\r\nfurniture, corsets, parlor furniture, mattresses, woven wire springs,\r\nundertakers' supplies, egg cases, dairy supplies, butter, concrete\r\nfence posts, sand-lime brick, prepared plaster, ice, gasoline engines,\r\nstore step-ladders, hard wood specialties, electrical supplies,\r\ngasoline storage tanks and measuring pumps, manure spreaders, overalls,\r\nwomen's skirts, suits and jackets, shirts, photo paper, brass goods,\r\ncoffee, spices, extracts, baking powder, sash, doors and blinds, steel\r\nbaskets, tanks, stoves, school books, umbrellas, vinegar, pickles,\r\nwagons, carriages, omnibuses, automobiles, patent medicines,\r\nphysicians' and hospital supplies, crushed stone, cigars, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that of the many industries started in Cedar Rapids\r\nwithin the past twenty years, a very large per cent have been financial\r\nsuccesses, some of them notably so. Nearly all of them have been\r\nlaunched in modest fashion and while nowhere is it possible for all\r\nenterprises to succeed, the few failures in Cedar Rapids have all been\r\nbrought about by causes purely individual in the management or because\r\nof circumstances which seemingly no one could control.\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids has passed beyond the experimental stage as a\r\nmanufacturing city. It has been demonstrated that industries can be\r\nestablished and operated successfully here and that goods made in Cedar\r\nRapids will find a ready and stable sale in all parts of the world. In\r\nfact, Cedar Rapids is but just beginning her epoch of industrial\r\nprosperity and growth and she extends to all the invitation to come,\r\nsee how those here are prospering, and join in the march of events\r\nwhich will in the years to come make Cedar Rapids one of the best\r\nknown manufacturing communities in the whole United States.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is not amiss to speak of the excellent conditions\r\nwhich have always surrounded the labor situation in this city. The\r\nmanufacturing industry must, of necessity, depend very largely on the\r\nelement of labor and in many localities strikes and strife and\r\nmisunderstanding and trouble generally have added to the difficulty of\r\nthe local situation. There has been but little of this sort of thing in\r\nCedar Rapids. Labor has always been well paid, well treated and well\r\nsatisfied in this city, and the little differences which have come up\r\nbetween employer and employee have all been settled promptly and\r\nsatisfactorily. There has been an absence of the grafting labor\r\nagitator and all have worked harmoniously together to build up the city\r\nand its best interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STREET RAILWAYS\r\n\r\nBY E. A. SHERMAN, EDITOR SATURDAY RECORD\r\n\r\nThe Marion and Cedar Rapids Improvement Company was incorporated March\r\n8, 1879, to construct street railways on the streets of Cedar Rapids\r\nand Marion, and the highway between, known as the \"Boulevard.\"\r\n\r\nThe incorporators were Addison Daniels, J. L. Crawford, C. C. Cook, and\r\nJohn Meredith Davis.\r\n\r\nThe officers were John Meredith Davis, president; James L. Crawford,\r\nsecretary; C. C. Cook, treasurer.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 1879, the city council of Marion passed an ordinance\r\nauthorizing construction of the line in the city of Marion. On May\r\n16th, the city council of Cedar Rapids passed an ordinance granting the\r\nMarion and Cedar Rapids Improvement Company the right to construct and\r\noperate street railways on Iowa avenue, and also on alternate streets.\r\n\r\nOctober 13, 1879, the name of the company was changed to the Cedar\r\nRapids and Marion Street Railway Company. John Meredith Davis resigned\r\nas president and was succeeded by W. M. Hewitt.\r\n\r\nNovember 8, 1879, the city of Cedar Rapids passed another ordinance\r\ngranting a franchise to the Cedar Rapids and Marion Street Railway\r\nCompany for lines on Iowa avenue and on alternate streets. Up to this\r\nlast date the enterprise had been fathered by Milwaukee and Davenport\r\nparties, who then dropped out. Construction had already been begun and\r\nthe work was continued by Marion parties, prominent among whom were Mr.\r\nE. Latham, J. L. Crawford, and J. C. Davis. Mr. Latham advanced the\r\nmoney necessary for construction.\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1880, Mr. Latham was made president of the company. In\r\nMarch of that year Judge George Greene (always foremost in any\r\nenterprise which would help Cedar Rapids) took a controlling interest\r\nin the company, and from that time forward, with the financial\r\nassistance rendered by Judge Greene, the work went rapidly on so that\r\nthe line began carrying passengers between Cedar Rapids and Marion on\r\nthe 3d of May, 1880, by steam motor between Twelfth street in Cedar\r\nRapids and the terminal station in Marion, and from Twelfth street to\r\nFourth street in Cedar Rapids in horse cars.\r\n\r\nBoth Judge Greene and Mr. Latham died early in the summer of 1880, and\r\nalthough Mr. S. C. Bever, Mr. A. J. McKean and other prominent citizens\r\nof Cedar Rapids and Marion afterwards became interested in the\r\nenterprise, the Greene family always held a controlling interest and\r\nwere foremost in management of the company up to the sale in 1890.\r\n\r\nMr. Latham was succeeded as president by William Greene on July 15,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\nThe board of supervisors forbade the company laying its track on the\r\nboulevard, and brought suit to enjoin such construction. The Eighteenth\r\nGeneral Assembly (1880) passed an act authorizing street railway\r\ntracks on roads 100 feet wide. So the supreme court sustained Judge\r\nShane in refusing the injunction. Early in the spring of 1881, the line\r\nwas extended across the steam railway tracks at Fourth street to the\r\nfoot of Iowa avenue. Soon after that date the company were not allowed\r\nto bring the steam motors below Fifteenth street, the horse cars\r\ncarrying the Marion passengers up to that point.\r\n\r\nThe track between Marion and the city limits of Cedar Rapids were laid\r\nwith \"T\" rails weighing sixteen pounds to the yard; afterwards changed\r\nto thirty-five pounds per yard. The horse car tracks were laid with\r\nflat rails weighing twenty-two to twenty-four pounds per yard, spiked\r\non the top of wooden stringers. The first equipment consisted of two\r\nsmall second hand steam motors and four cars.\r\n\r\nThe extensions and additions made were: In 1882, track to fair ground\r\nfrom First to B avenue, only operated during fairs and amusements. Line\r\non Adams (now Third) street, First avenue to Fourteenth avenue. Opened\r\nSeptember 7, 1882. Line from First avenue and Commercial (now First)\r\nstreet to Third avenue, across Third avenue bridge on Third avenue to\r\nSixth street west; also line on Third street north from Third avenue to\r\nA avenue, and south to Seventh avenue west. These west side lines began\r\ndoing business in the fall of 1882, and early in 1883 car and horse\r\nbarns were built at Third avenue and Third street west.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, line extended from Third street and Seventh avenue west to J.\r\nC. Young's addition at Sixth street and Fifteenth avenue west and\r\nafterwards taken up for want of business.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, line from First avenue east along Fifth street to Fifth\r\navenue, up First avenue to Tenth street, thence on Tenth street and\r\nMount Vernon road to Oak Hill cemetery; opened for business July 4,\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nFair ground line taken up. New line on Sixteenth street from First to E\r\navenue, built and put in operation November 15, 1886.\r\n\r\nAs the branch lines of horse railroad within the city of Cedar Rapids\r\npaid no profit, the Marion stockholders stoutly objected to the\r\nearnings of the Marion line being used for the sole benefit of the\r\npeople of Cedar Rapids. So the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway Co., on\r\nthe 13th of July, 1889, conveyed to John W. Henderson--for the sum of\r\none dollar--all of these branch lines excepting the Sixteenth street\r\nline. Mr. Henderson on November 14, 1889, deeded the same to the Cedar\r\nRapids Street Railway, a company organized for the purpose of operating\r\nthese city lines, and for the further construction of other city lines\r\nin Cedar Rapids, of which company C. G. Greene was president, U. C.\r\nBlake, vice-president, W. J. Greene, secretary, and George Greene,\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nThese city lines failed to earn enough to pay operating expenses and\r\nwere all conveyed back to the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway Co. on\r\nFebruary 9, 1891. For the year ending June 30, 1884, the number of\r\nemployes of the company was twenty, the annual wages $11,667.44. In\r\n1889 the number of employes averaged twenty-eight and the annual wages\r\n$15,878.00.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1886 to 1890, the west side lines had been gradually\r\nabandoned, so that on December 1, 1890, there was only remaining the\r\none on First street and across the Third avenue bridge to Third street,\r\nand thence on Third street southwesterly to Seventh avenue.\r\n\r\nThe entire equipment at that date consisted of two steam motors, two\r\n28-foot coaches, one open trail car, 20 feet long, one baggage car, one\r\n18-foot, six 12-foot, and eleven 10-foot horse cars, two snow plows,\r\ntwo flat cars and nineteen horses and mules, with the necessary harness\r\nand fixtures.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1890 it came to the knowledge of Mr. J. S. Ely that\r\nnon-resident parties were investigating the situation with a view of\r\nacquiring the property of the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway, together\r\nwith the city lines then owned by the Cedar Rapids Street Railway. Mr.\r\nEly believing that it would be best for the interests of the city of\r\nCedar Rapids that control of the transportation facilities be in the\r\nhands of resident property owners, who would have a greater interest in\r\na more extensive system and better service, than those seeking merely\r\nfinancial profit, obtained options on a controlling interest in the\r\ncapital stock of both of the companies. After which Mr. Ely and Mr.\r\nHenry V. Ferguson organized a syndicate consisting of Messrs. A. T.\r\nAverill, James L. Bever, Chas. H. Clark, Geo. B. Douglas, Walter D.\r\nDouglas, C. J. Ives, C. Magnus, P. E. Hall, J. S. Ely, and Henry V.\r\nFerguson, who on December 15, 1890, purchased two-thirds of the entire\r\ncapital stock of the two companies (the C. R. & M. Ry. and the C. R.\r\nStreet Ry.) buying out all of the old stockholders except Frances R.\r\nGreene, C. G. Greene, S. C. Bever, Geo. W. Bever, and U. C. Blake.\r\nImmediately after this change of control, the stockholders paid in\r\nmoney enough to clear up all the floating debt of the companies, and\r\nput them on a good financial basis. The stockholders addressed the\r\nfollowing communication to the mayor and city council of Cedar Rapids:\r\n\r\n     \"To the Honorable Mayor and City Council of the City of\r\n     Cedar Rapids, Iowa:\r\n\r\n     \"The undersigned stockholders in the Cedar Rapids and Marion\r\n     Railway, and in the Cedar Rapids Street Railway Company,\r\n     respectfully represent to your honorable body that they are\r\n     the absolute owners of all the stock of the corporations,\r\n     and all are resident tax payers in said city, largely\r\n     interested in its general progress and prosperity; that it\r\n     is their purpose and intention to reconstruct, improve and\r\n     extend the properties now operated by the said companies and\r\n     to run the cars on said lines by electric power as soon as\r\n     the necessary authority and the additional rights and\r\n     franchises required are granted, and on the granting of the\r\n     same, we pledge ourselves to take immediate steps toward\r\n     putting on electric service, and to rebuild, maintain and\r\n     operate, and from time to time extend the lines in said city\r\n     to the full extent that ordinary business prudence will\r\n     warrant.\r\n\r\n     \"We, therefore, petition your honorable body to grant said\r\n     corporations the necessary authority, rights and franchises\r\n     to enable them to enter upon and make the changes and\r\n     improvements above mentioned.\r\n\r\n     \"P.

Blake.\r\n\r\n     \"Dated December 31, 1890.\"\r\n\r\nThe franchise asked for by these stockholders was for twenty-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above application was warmly supported by the leading\r\nnewspapers of Cedar Rapids, the city council refused the franchise so\r\nasked for, but instead on May 1, 1891, granted to the Thomson-Houston\r\nElectric Co. a franchise for fifty years, for lines covering\r\nsubstantially the same territory on the east side of the river as that\r\nserved by the horse cars, and also for three miles of new lines on the\r\nwest side of the river, to be afterwards located.\r\n\r\nSo these gentlemen who had put up their money to save the city of Cedar\r\nRapids from non-resident ownership of transportation lines, found their\r\npurpose frustrated and with a fair prospect of losing their entire\r\ninvestment. Rather than suffer this, a majority decided to acquire this\r\nnew franchise at the best price obtainable, and then go ahead with\r\nconstruction according to its terms. After this decision Mr. Ives and\r\nMr. Magnus retired from the enterprise and took back their money.\r\nPreviously, during the negotiation for the franchise, Mr. S. C. Bever\r\nand Mr. U. C. Blake had sold out. On the organization of the new\r\ncompany to take over the Thomson-Houston franchise, Mrs. Frances R.\r\nGreene, C. G. Greene and Geo. W. Bever sold their interests to the\r\nremaining stockholders.\r\n\r\nNeither the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway nor the Cedar Rapids Street\r\nRailway ever paid a dividend, so that all of the stockholders who had\r\ninvested their money in these enterprises went out with entire loss of\r\nincome, and most of them with considerable loss of principal.\r\n\r\nJ. P. Messer was superintendent from January 1, 1881, to February 22,\r\n1883, when he resigned and was succeeded by Wm. Elsom, who remained\r\nsuperintendent until after the system had been changed into an electric\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDAR RAPIDS AND MARION CITY RAILWAY COMPANY\r\n\r\nThe Cedar Rapids and Marion City Railway Company was organized May 14,\r\n1891, and immediately thereafter purchased the franchise for electric\r\nrailways in Cedar Rapids recently granted to the Thomson-Houston\r\nElectric Co., and also took over all the rights, property and\r\nfranchises of the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway. A franchise for\r\ntwenty-five years for an electric line from the terminal point in the\r\ncity of Marion to the southwesterly city limits of Marion was granted\r\nto this company at about that time. The first officers were: Jas. L.\r\nBever, president; Walter D. Douglas, vice-president; Chas. H. Clark,\r\ntreasurer; Glenn M. Averill, secretary.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months Jas. L. Bever and A. T. Averill sold out and\r\nretired from the enterprise. After the reorganization resulting from\r\nthis change in ownership, the officers were: P. E. Hall, president; W.\r\nD. Douglas, vice-president; Chas. H. Clark, treasurer; John S. Ely,\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nThe stockholders were: Chas. H. Clark, Geo. B. Douglas, John S. Ely, J.\r\nS. Cook, Walter D. Douglas, Henry V. Ferguson, and P. E. Hall, of Cedar\r\nRapids, Horace Williams, of Clinton, Iowa, J. E. Ainsworth, of Council\r\nBluffs, Iowa, now of Williamstown, Vt., David P. Kimball and L. C.\r\nKimball, of Boston, Mass., and J. Van Deventer, of Knoxville, Tenn.\r\n\r\nNo change of ownership except through division of estates of deceased\r\nstockholders has taken place up to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe work of construction and reconstruction was begun at once and\r\nvigorously pushed during the season of 1891.\r\n\r\nAll tracks were entirely new excepting from Sixteenth street to Marion.\r\nThose across the First avenue bridge were laid with strap rails, nailed\r\nto the bridge plank. The balance of the double track with 58 pound\r\ngirder rails. All other new lines with 45 pound \"T\" rail. The strap\r\nrail was taken off the bridge and girder rail substituted a few years\r\nthereafter. The city lines on the east side of the river were open for\r\nbusiness in November, 1891, the west side lines in December, 1891, and\r\nelectric service begun to Marion in February, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe main line mileage of the road at this date, not counting spur and\r\nsidetracks is, within the city of Cedar Rapids 12.85 miles, of which\r\n2.28 miles is double track. From the city limits at Kenwood to Marion,\r\n2.80 miles; total 15.65 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Marion line above Twentieth street through to Marion has been\r\nentirely rebuilt with new rails, the grades cut down, the alignment\r\nchanged, the track ballasted, a new steel and concrete bridge built\r\nover Indian creek; so as to make that portion of the road fully\r\nadequate for the business.\r\n\r\nWithin the last three years all of the girder rail tracks east of the\r\nriver have been relaid with 60 and 80 pound \"T\" rails and the number of\r\nties increased fifty per cent.\r\n\r\nThe service has been increased to once in fifteen minutes each way and\r\nextended to twelve o'clock at night on all the lines excepting the\r\nMarion line, where the service is once in twenty minutes during the day\r\nand up to 12:30 a. m.\r\n\r\nThe power plant first installed consisted of two 125 horsepower engines\r\nconnected by belts to two 75 k. w. generators. It now consists of one\r\n400 horsepower engine belted to a 300 k. w. generator, and one 750\r\nhorsepower engine directly connected to a 450 k. w. generator. The\r\noutput of power is equalized by a storage battery of 272 cells. The\r\nboilers, smoke stack, switch board, condensers and all minor machinery\r\nhave been correspondingly increased and improved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. B.

Christian Hershey]\r\n\r\nThe car barn (originally a wooden iron-clad building 80×140 feet) has\r\nbeen enlarged and new brick buildings erected with shop room for\r\nbuilding car bodies and trucks, and making all necessary repairs to\r\ncars and electric equipment; so that the present storage shop and\r\noffice buildings, with storage for lumber and ties, covers six full\r\nsized city lots. The company now builds its own car trucks and car\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nFor the year 1892 (first year of operation of electric lines) the\r\naverage number of employes was 81, and the total wages paid $37,610.12.\r\nFor the year 1908 the average number of employes was 143 and the annual\r\nwages $84,328.73.\r\n\r\nWilliam Elsom was superintendent from the organization of the company\r\nuntil June, 1892, when he resigned and was succeeded by F. L. Diserens,\r\nwho still holds that position.\r\n\r\nThe present officers and directors are: P. E. Hall, president; Henry V.\r\nFerguson, vice-president and secretary; John S.

It was not until 1897 that a permanent commercial club came\r\ninto being and that organization, which is now known as the Cedar\r\nRapids Commercial Club, has for the past twelve years played a most\r\nimportant part in the upbuilding of the city and the promotion of its\r\nbest commercial and industrial interests.\r\n\r\nThe events leading up to the organization of the Commercial Club form\r\nan interesting story, and as the editor of _The Record_ was personally\r\nidentified with them, he here takes the liberty of making the facts a\r\nmatter of record.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1897, a meeting of the Fifth District Editorial Association\r\nwas held at Excelsior Springs, Mo., and as part of the entertainment, a\r\ndelegation from the Commercial Club of Kansas City, escorted the\r\nmembers of the Editorial Association from Excelsior Springs to Kansas\r\nCity and devoted a day to showing them Kansas City from every point of\r\nview. The stock yards, the packing houses, the fire department, the\r\nnewspaper offices, the parks were visited, a reception and luncheon\r\nwere tendered at the Commercial Club rooms and a dinner was served at\r\none of the leading hotels. Following the return of the party to\r\nExcelsior Springs, A. N. Palmer, president of the Cedar Rapids Business\r\nCollege and editor of the _American Penman_, and the editor of _The\r\nRecord_ were discussing the splendid entertainment of the Kansas City\r\nboosters and what it meant to a city to have such a live organization;\r\nand it was then and there decided that Cedar Rapids ought to have such\r\na club. The matter was talked over at length and the result was that as\r\nsoon as possible after returning home, Mr. Palmer issued a letter to\r\nsome 400 of the business men of the city reciting the need of such an\r\norganization in Cedar Rapids and calling a meeting for the purpose of\r\nconsidering its formation. That meeting was held in the assembly room\r\nof the Cedar Rapids Business College on the evening of June 8, 1897. It\r\nwas decided to form the club and at a subsequent meeting, held July 2d,\r\nthe club was formally organized. A. N. Palmer was chosen the first\r\npresident and the editor of _The Record_ was elected temporary\r\nsecretary, serving until the election of the first permanent paid\r\nsecretary, Ed. R. Shaw, who assumed office July 15th. The first offices\r\nof the club were in the Granby building, the rent being a donation from\r\nMr. E. A. Higley. Subsequently, in May, 1901, came the consolidation of\r\nthe Commercial Club with the Occidental Club and the removal to the\r\nMasonic Temple, which has since been the home of the club.\r\n\r\nWith the consolidation came the addition of the social feature,\r\nincluding reading room, billiards, and later, the inauguration of the\r\nnoon-day lunch, which latter has proved to be most popular, and which\r\nhas done much to bring the members in closer touch each with the other.\r\n\r\nEver since organization the Commercial Club has been fortunate in\r\nsecuring as officers men who have been willing and able to give the\r\norganization their time, best thought and energy, with the result that\r\nit has been and is now a live and potent force in the community. Such\r\nmen as Palmer, Anderson, Forbes, Newman, Safely, Rall, and others, have\r\nfilled the presidency with credit to themselves and profit to the club\r\nand the city, and in Shaw, Lincoln, Charles, Simmons, Sessions, Shaver,\r\nBell, and Wunderlich the Commercial Club has had secretaries who have\r\nlabored faithfully to further the best interests of the organization\r\nand city. The present officers, J. F. Rall, president, and John\r\nWunderlich, secretary, are making records in their administration and\r\nachieving results that speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Commercial Club is so wide-spreading and presents so\r\nmany aspects that it is impossible to refer to it in any detail. The\r\nidea of the club is to arrange systematic work to be done by the\r\nmembers, as well as by the officers, and with that in view, there are a\r\nnumber of committees in charge of various departments of the work, as\r\nfollows: Assembly, Civic, Entertainments, Executive, House, Interurban,\r\nLegislative, Manufactures, Mercantile, Membership, Navigation on Cedar\r\nRiver, Public Institutions, Trade Extension, Tariff and Transportation,\r\nSpecial Convention, Railway Service, Statistics. These are all regular\r\nstanding committees. In addition, many special committees are appointed\r\nto take up special or emergency matters.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the labors and aid of the Commercial Club, many\r\nprosperous and valuable manufacturing industries have been brought to\r\nCedar Rapids the past twelve years. Many local businesses have been\r\nencouraged to start and aided on their way to success. Many established\r\nbusinesses that have needed encouragement have been given it and other\r\nbusinesses that have found difficulties in their pathway have had those\r\ndifficulties removed through the offices of the Commercial Club and its\r\nmembers. Conventions and public gatherings of many kinds have been\r\ninduced to hold their meetings in this city through work performed by\r\nthe Commercial Club. Vexatious local disputes have been adjusted, and\r\nwhen cities like Indianapolis have attempted to entice such\r\norganizations as the Order of Railway Conductors away from Cedar\r\nRapids, the Commercial Club has been found stanchly and successfully\r\ncontesting the removal. When it was found necessary to secure\r\nlegislation amending some phases of the commission plan law to make it\r\nfully applicable to Cedar Rapids, it was the Commercial Club that went\r\nbefore the legislature and secured the needed amendments. It was the\r\nCommercial Club that first began the work of running trade excursions,\r\nan idea that has grown with each year. The trip of this spring, to Le\r\nMars, via the Illinois Central and return via Sheldon, Mason City, and\r\nCalmar on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, occupying four days with\r\nninety in the party, was by all odds the best and most profitable of\r\nall the series.\r\n\r\nWithin the past year a new and valuable department has been created in\r\nthe freight traffic bureau. The work of this department is to bring\r\nabout an equitable condition in freight rates for Cedar Rapids, as\r\ncompared with other cities of like location and surroundings and\r\neliminate discriminatory freight rates as compared with other jobbing\r\ncenters. In the prosecution of the work of this bureau, the Commercial\r\nClub has been most successful, for up to the present time adjustments\r\nbrought about by the bureau represent a saving of about $24,000 per\r\nyear to the manufacturers, jobbers and business men of the city. In\r\naddition to the work of bringing about an equalization of freight\r\nrates, an individual service is maintained for the purpose of examining\r\nfreight claims against the railway companies. In this particular many\r\nclaims of long standing have been satisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Club has a present membership of 280, made up of the\r\nleading business and professional men of the city. It is a live, active\r\norganization, reflecting the best and most progressive citizenship of\r\nthe community. The club apartments occupy a large portion of the fourth\r\nfloor of the Masonic Temple, are commodious and comfortable, and form a\r\ngathering place for the discussion of matters which affect the business\r\nprosperity of the city. Regular meetings of the board of directors are\r\nheld every Monday noon, following a lunch served in the directors'\r\nroom, and at these meetings the docket for the week is cleared up. It\r\nis a significant fact that these meetings are attended by practically\r\nthe entire membership of the directory and that no matter is allowed to\r\ndrag for want of immediate attention.\r\n\r\nThe officers and directors of the Commercial Club at the present time\r\nare: President, J. F. Rall; first vice-president, F. Junkermann; second\r\nvice-president, S. G. Armstrong; secretary, John Wunderlich; treasurer,\r\nL. W. Anderson; directors, J. W. Barry, J. S. Broeksmit, W. L. Cherry,\r\nJ. M. Denning, Kent C. Ferman, J. M. Grimm, W. G. Haskell, Geo. T.\r\nHedges, E. E. Pinney, R. I. Safely, John H. Taft.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO PAID THE TAXES IN CEDAR RAPIDS FIFTY YEARS AGO\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS DEVENDORF\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids has made many changes and improvements during the past\r\nhalf century. But perhaps no change has been so great as the change in\r\nthe valuation of property. In 1858 there was a population of only about\r\nthirty-five hundred within the city limits, and in the entire county\r\nonly eighteen thousand. Twenty per cent of the population then resided\r\nin Cedar Rapids. Today we claim nearly thirty-five thousand and over\r\nfifty per cent of the entire population of the county. At that time the\r\narea of the city was very much less than at present. Franklin street,\r\nnow Eleventh street east, was as far as was platted. Beyond was heavily\r\nwooded and used in summers for picnic parties; to the south Carpenter's\r\nfirst addition had already been laid and but very few of the lots had\r\nbeen improved, the lower end, where the packing plant of T. M. Sinclair\r\n& Co. is located, was used as a race track, where the local horsemen\r\ncompeted. Kingston, on the west side of the river, was an independent\r\nmunicipality, having its own city government and city officers, and\r\nremained so until the year 1870, when it was annexed and became a part\r\nof the present Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe assessed valuation of the city for the year 1858 was for both real\r\nestate and personal the sum of $535,912--what proportion that amount\r\nwill bear to the real cash value of the property the writer is unable\r\nto state. But it is the rule generally adopted by assessors to make the\r\nvalue much less than the price parties would buy and sell the same\r\nproperty for, and on this assessment of $535,912 a levy was made of two\r\nmills on the dollar, which, if the collector was diligent and had good\r\nluck, would have produced the sum of $1,071.00, which the city officers\r\ncould use to carry on the affairs of the city--pay salaries, make\r\nimprovements, grade streets, build crossings, and to meet all other\r\nexpenses of the city. That this sum was inadequate for the purpose is\r\nshown by the fact that the larger share of the taxes of this year were\r\npaid in what they denominated \"city script,\" which we call city\r\nwarrants, so that the city fathers had very little real cash in the\r\ncity treasury. This city script was issued for work and salaries and\r\nsuch other expenses as were necessary and was not interest bearing, so\r\nthat a party that had such script was ready to dispose of the same to\r\nthe best advantage he could, and parties that had taxes to pay would\r\ngather up such script at what discount they could get and use it for\r\nthe purpose of paying their taxes. The larger tax payers all paid in\r\n\"city script.\"\r\n\r\nThe city officials of that time are all dead. R. C. Rock was mayor;\r\nGeorge Seymour, recorder; A. S. Koontz, treasurer; A. S. Belt, city\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nJ. J. Snouffer and John G. Graves were the aldermen from the first\r\nward; D. W. Sprague and R. R. Taylor, aldermen from the second ward;\r\nWm. Richmond and S. A. Shattuck, aldermen from the third ward.\r\n\r\nThere are only eight residents of this city at the present time whose\r\nnames appear on the tax list of fifty years ago; the only ones we can\r\nremember are the following: James Bird, Isaac Carroll, E. Coulter, C.\r\nFordyce, Jos. Perigo, David Lighty, P. F. Randall, and Wesley Stephens.\r\nSome of the above paid a poll tax only. David Lighty paid tax on lot 3,\r\nblock 28, original town, and has paid taxes on this same lot all the\r\nyears since and owns the property today. Isaac Whittam paid the taxes\r\non lot 5, block 13, original town. This is the corner lot on which the\r\nMontrose Hotel is located. The lot was then valued at $550, and the tax\r\nwas $1.10. Isaac Carroll paid the taxes on three city lots, the total\r\nvalue of which was $585; also on two horses, value $150; one carriage,\r\nvalue $75; his tax was $1.92, paid in script. E. Coulter paid on a\r\nstock of merchandise (drugs) valued at $800.\r\n\r\nA few others who are listed on the tax books of half a century ago are\r\nknown to be living, but have removed to other places.\r\n\r\nW. W. Smith, of Minneapolis, who was an active business man at that\r\ntime, owned five lots on Second street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues\r\neast, on which he built a large brick building, intending to use it as\r\na hotel. It was, however, used as a residence property, and was known\r\nas the Wadsworth Block. This property was located where the Illinois\r\nCentral railroad lately erected their fine new freight depot, corner of\r\nFifth avenue and Second street.\r\n\r\nS. D. Carpenter, now a resident of Chicago, paid the taxes on the south\r\n280 feet of out lot 4, valued at $850, tax $1.90. This property is\r\nlocated on Third avenue, between Eighth and Tenth streets, and includes\r\nthe homes of A. Sinclair, Rev. Burkhalter, Ed. Clark, and the late home\r\nof Robert Williams.\r\n\r\nGeo. Greene was the largest individual taxpayer of that day. He was\r\nassessed with some 70 city lots. Many of them were in the business part\r\nof town, the total assessed value of these was $28,575, and the tax was\r\n$56.40.\r\n\r\nIn his list were lots 3, 4, 5, 6, block 24 original plat, property on\r\nwhich is now located the Allison hotel, the College Inn and the three\r\nbusiness rooms to the west, all on First avenue. Also a lot at corner\r\nof Second avenue and Fourth street, now owned by Mr. C. Magnus; these\r\nfour lots were valued at $2,200 and the tax was $4.40. He owned lots 4\r\nand 5 block 42 assessed at $300 each. These are now the homes of Dr.\r\nGeo. Carpenter and Mike Ford. He also paid the taxes on 125 feet on\r\nFirst street lots now occupied by the Rudolph block, the Gazette\r\noffice, Geo. C. Haman drug store and Geo. Yuill farm implements. The\r\ntotal value of this 125 feet was $3,600, the taxes $7.20. At that time\r\nthis property was occupied by a large three story hotel called Greene's\r\nhotel, and it is said by those who were guests of the house that it was\r\none of the best west of Chicago. The next largest taxpayer was John F.\r\nEly, who was assessed on 38 building lots at an assessed value of\r\n$24,800 and on which he paid a tax of $51.16. Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, block\r\n14, original plat, was valued at $3,500.00, tax on same $7.00. This was\r\nhis home. A comfortable, unpretentious cottage occupied the center of\r\nblock, surrounded by shrubbery, flowers and many apple trees. These\r\nlots are now occupied by the large business houses of Jones & Luberger,\r\nMartin Dry Goods Co., the Dows block on the corner of Second street\r\nand Second avenue, and also Snowden's, corner of Third street and\r\nSecond avenue. He also was assessed with the property now belonging to\r\nthe Churchill estate, corner of First street and Second avenue, value\r\n$1,150.00, tax on same $2.30. Lot 10, block 24, original plat, now\r\noccupied by the Cedar Rapids National Bank and for many years known as\r\nthe old Baptist church corner, was assessed at $700.00 and the tax was\r\n$1.40.\r\n\r\nMr. Ely was also the owner of lots 4, 5, 8, 9, block 15, which is now\r\nthe John H. Taft corner, and the store of Ludy & Taylor, all on First\r\navenue, together with the property on which is located the \"Oriel\"\r\nblock and part of the next lot to the west, both on Second avenue.\r\nThese four lots now just in the most valuable part of the business\r\ndistrict, were valued at $2,850.00, on which he paid the city tax of\r\n$5.70. The lot on the corner of Second avenue and Fifth street on which\r\nthe Public Library is located, was one of his lots and is one that he\r\ncontinued to own up to the time it was condemned by the library board\r\nfor the purpose of erecting the library building. This lot was assessed\r\nat $425.00, tax paid 85 cents. He was also the owner of lots 8, 9, 10,\r\nblock 23, original plat. These are on First avenue between Fourth and\r\nFifth streets. These three lots were assessed at $1,350.00, tax paid on\r\nsame, $2.70.\r\n\r\nThe lots 1 and 2, block 4, was also included in his district. These are\r\non the corner of First street and Second avenue. It was regarded as\r\nvaluable property by the assessor of fifty years ago, as he has these\r\ntwo lots assessed at $3,700.00. No other two lots in the city were\r\nrated at so high a value as these. This must have been regarded as the\r\nbest business location of that day.\r\n\r\nThe next Cedar Rapids tax payer who had to gather up the next largest\r\namount of city scrip with which to pay his city tax was Mr. N. B.\r\nBrown, who was assessed with 47 city lots the total value of which was\r\n$20,750. This with some personal property, as merchandise, horses, cows\r\nand bridge stock made his total property valuation $23,290.00 and on\r\nthis amount he paid a city tax of $46.58. Mr. Brown was one of the\r\nowners of the original plat of the city and many pieces of property\r\nwhich are now very valuable was at that time set off to him as his\r\nshare of the original town plat.\r\n\r\nLots 3 and 4, block 25, are two valuable pieces of property. These are\r\non Second avenue between Third and Fourth streets and on which is\r\nlocated the Damour Grocery House, and some of the property on which the\r\nnew government postoffice is erected. These two lots were assessed at\r\n$900.00 on which he paid a tax of $1.80. Mr. Brown also was the owner\r\nof lots 6, 7, 8, block 23. These were on the north side of First avenue\r\nand extended from Fourth street west to where the Grand hotel now is\r\nand included the Chicago & Northwestern freight depot, the Pullman\r\nHouse, the Delavan hotel and the property now owned by Mr. Lansing and\r\nused as a saloon. These three valuable lots were then assessed at\r\n$1,700.00 on which he paid the tax of $3.40.\r\n\r\nAnother fine piece of property was his home, which was the entire block\r\n38. His fine brick residence was located in the center of the block and\r\nwas at that day one of the finest dwellings in this part of the state.\r\nThese ten lots which were all included was valued at $3,250.00. This\r\nproperty has been sold and sub-divided until the only part left is the\r\nsoutheast corner of the block which N. E. Brown his son, now occupies\r\nwith a fine modern brick dwelling, directly opposite Grace Episcopal\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nHe was also the owner of the property on which Gorman's hotel is\r\nlocated. This hotel was built by Mr. Brown and a few years after it was\r\nconsidered the best hotel to be found in this part of the state. The\r\nupper story was finished for an amusement place and before the building\r\nof Greene's opera house this was the only place that could be used for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown was largely engaged in milling at that time and owned and\r\noperated a woolen mill and also a flouring mill, the buildings of both\r\nare still standing but have not been in operation for some time.\r\n\r\nGreene, Merritt & Co. were the bankers of that period and were assessed\r\nwith one city lot, corner of First street and B avenue, value $700.00,\r\ntogether with their bank capital $20,000. Their city tax was $41.50.\r\nThe senior member of this firm was Geo. Greene, who was the largest\r\nreal estate owner of that date and who has been mentioned before in\r\nthis article. Mr. Merritt, the other member of the banking firm, was a\r\nbrother-in-law of Mr. Greene. Messrs. Geo. Greene, Wm.

SELMAN,\r\nPresident of the Senate\r\n\r\nApproved January 15th, 1849.\r\nANSEL BRIGGS, Governor\r\n\r\nSecretary's Office, Iowa City, Iowa, March 27th, 1849.\r\n\r\n     I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct\r\n     copy of the original act now on file in the said office.\r\n\r\n                             JOSIAH H. BONNEY, Secretary of State\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST CITY OFFICIALS OF CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nAt 1 o'clock of April 4, 1849, the citizens of Cedar Rapids met at the\r\nschool house, in accordance with the requirements of the law, and\r\nproceeded to elect town officers under a charter issued by the\r\nlegislature and approved January 15, 1849 (for text of this document\r\nsee Laws of Iowa, 1849, p. 116). The first election was in the nature\r\nof a mass meeting. William P. Harman was made chairman and Arven\r\nKennedy, John H. Brooks, and John G. Cole selected as judges of\r\nelection. Eber L. Mansfield was clerk of election. These judges\r\ncertified to choice of votes as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mayor, Martin L. Barber.\r\n     Councilmen, Joseph Greene, Stephen L. Pollock, and James Leverich.\r\n     Recorder, Homer Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThe mayor immediately took the oath of office before John L. Shearer,\r\njustice of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the council was held May 11, 1849. Action was\r\ntaken appointing Lowell Daniels treasurer of the town, to give bonds of\r\n$20. It was resolved that the municipal seal \"shall consist of a raised\r\ncircle nine-tenths of an inch in diameter, enclosing an equilateral\r\ntriangle.\" The first ordinance in preamble declared, that \"there exists\r\nin the town divers unwholesome cellars, dung heaps, horse stables, cow\r\nstables, barns, yards, hogpens, and other nuisances.\" The object of the\r\nenactment was to abate these conditions. In July, 1849, Homer Kennedy\r\nresigned as recorder and Porter W. Earle was chosen in his place. A\r\nsort of omnibus ordinance was passed October 23, 1849. This prohibited\r\nthe sale of spirituous liquors, required that shows or other\r\nexhibitions should pay license of not less than one dollar nor more\r\nthan ten dollars. A further section fixed penalties for disturbance of\r\nany public meeting. This ordinance was given effective publication by\r\nbeing \"posted at G. Greene & Bro.'s store.\" Other ordinances, we find,\r\nwere \"posted on John Coffman's door.\" John H. Brooks, marshal of the\r\ntown, was on November 8, 1849, allowed the sum of $16.73. Getting\r\npossession of so much money he immediately resigned, presumably to\r\nenjoy it without official cares.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND ELECTION\r\n\r\nThe second election was held at the school house April 3, 1850. For\r\nmayor Martin L. Barber received 39 votes and Johnson Hill 27. For\r\nrecorder John Palmer received 63 and Lawson Daniels 1. Stephen L.\r\nPollock, Thomas Downing and Charles C. Cook were the successful\r\ncouncilmen, the defeated candidates being George H. Ely, Joseph Greene,\r\nIsaac Cook, and W. P. Harman.\r\n\r\nThis new council on April 11, 1850, resolved to form a board of health,\r\nbut at the next meeting this action was rescinded. In its stead an\r\nordinance was passed for preservation of public health. Enforcement of\r\nthese provisions rested with the marshal. In May an ordinance was\r\npassed permitting Harvey C. Higley to retail ardent spirits, upon\r\ngiving a good and sufficient bond \"to keep a good and orderly house,\r\nnot permitting any gambling, drunkenness or rioting about his house or\r\npremises.\" Such bond Mr. Higley refused to execute, and the employment\r\nof counsel was authorized to commence suit against him for violation of\r\nordinance. July 24 a health board was appointed consisting of Drs. J.\r\nF. Ely, S. D. Carpenter, and J. C. Traer. The marshal, under direction\r\nof the board, was to abate all nuisances. The first recorders of the\r\ncity were evidently not of fixed mind or habitation. John Palmer\r\nresigned as such December 8, and S. C. Koontz was chosen to fill the\r\nvacancy. Isaac Cook was made attorney for the city in pending\r\nlitigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST TAX LEVY\r\n\r\nThe first tax levy mentioned was ordered by action of council December\r\n16, 1850. This amounted to \"one and one-half mills on the dollar of all\r\ntaxable property within the corporation,\" and Johnson Hill was\r\nappointed assessor. Another ordinance to prevent the sale of spiritous\r\nand intoxicating liquors was passed December 16, 1850. Any quantity\r\nless than a gallon sold \"without advice of a physician,\" rendered the\r\nseller liable to a fine of not less than five dollars nor more than\r\ntwenty-five. A license fee of from one to five dollars was exacted from\r\nall peddlers, whether they were footmen with packs or sold goods from\r\nwagons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1851\r\n\r\nAnnual town election was again held in April, 1851. At this time\r\nNicholas B. Brown was chosen as mayor. Benjamin Weizer, Michael Bryan,\r\nand Joseph A. Love, councilmen, and S. C. Koontz, recorder. William G.\r\nFurman was appointed marshal. The personnel of the board of health was\r\nalso changed. Dr. L. Larrabee, Dr. Thomas, and Dr. John F. Ely\r\nconstituting the same.\r\n\r\nNo recorded meeting of council was held from June 20, 1851, to February\r\n24 of the next year. At this latter date N. B. Brown, mayor, by advice\r\nand consent of the councilmen, \"did grant license to David W. King for\r\nfree navigation of the Cedar River, opposite this place, for the term\r\nof one year from the 1st day of March, 1857, by the said D. W. King\r\npaying to the recorder the sum of ten dollars.\" The council fixed rates\r\nof toll as follows: Horse and rider 10 cents; footmen, 5 cents; one\r\nhorse and wagon, 15 cents; a wagon and two horses, 20 cents; and every\r\nadditional span of horses or yoke of cattle, 20 cents. Loose cattle not\r\nexceeding five in number, he shall be allowed 5 cents per head; if more\r\nthan that number, 3 cents per head. Hogs, if not exceeding twenty-five\r\nin number, shall be 2 cents per head; if more than that number the toll\r\nshall be 1 cent per head. Sheep at the rate of 1 cent per head.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SIDEWALK ORDINANCE\r\n\r\nThe first sidewalk ordinance stipulated: \"The sidewalks of Commercial\r\nstreet shall be planked or paved, commencing at the corner of Benton\r\nand Commercial streets, northeast side, and ending at the corner of\r\nSugar and Commercial streets. Also on the southwest side of said\r\nstreet, commencing at the southeast side of Rock and Brather's shop and\r\ncoming up as far us Linn street. In case where planked the plank to be\r\noak and not less than one and one-half inches in thickness, also to be\r\nplaced upon a good and permanent foundation. In the front of buildings\r\nthe walk to be made ten feet in width, not less than five stringers to\r\nbe used. In front of lots or parts of lots not occupied by buildings it\r\nis only required that walks be made five feet in width, in which case\r\nthree stringers are sufficient, but not less than three. All of which\r\nmust be completed by the 1st of September, 1852.\"\r\n\r\nSamuel Brazelton was appointed marshal, Dr. Koontz treasurer, and Dr.\r\nS. D. Carpenter, Wm. D. Wood, and Porter W. Earle, health board.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION OF 1853\r\n\r\nIn 1853 election was held on Wednesday, April 6. W. W. Smith was chosen\r\nmayor; S. C. Bever, Johnson Hill, and J. F. Ely, councilmen; and S. C.\r\nKoontz, recorder. Hiram Deem was appointed assessor, Isaac N. Whittam,\r\ntown marshal. At this same date, May 6, 1853, John F. Ely was made\r\ncommittee to secure a surveyor, \"Major McKean, or some other suitable\r\nperson to take and establish the grades of the city of Cedar Rapids.\"\r\nPratt R. Skinner was the person selected and his report and profile\r\nwere presented and adopted July 6, 1853. Hiram Deem was made marshal\r\nJuly 23, Mr. Whittam evidently not having qualified. At this meeting a\r\nmunicipal tax levy of four mills was ordered. Hiram Deem, having\r\naccomplished his work as assessor, and now being marshal, was\r\ninstructed to collect the taxes. He was further directed to order out\r\nmen to work the roads and streets immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEMETERIES\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Oak Hill cemetery dates from an ordinance of August\r\n23, 1853. Gabriel Carpenter had purchased 300 acres of land adjoining\r\nthe city and including the site of the cemetery. The place of burial at\r\nthat time was upon the ground after owned by Coe College. The ordinance\r\nenacted that \"the proposition made by G. Carpenter in respect to ten\r\nacres of land for purpose of graveyard be filed and accepted. Provided,\r\nhowever, that if the collegiate institute will pay the aforesaid G.\r\nCarpenter for the aforementioned ten acres of land, and, further\r\nprovided, that if the mayor and council hold and possess the power and\r\nright to sell and convey the lot of land now occupied by a graveyard\r\n(within the corporate limits) and can sell and convey the same to the\r\nCollegiate Institute for the sum of three hundred dollars, then the\r\nafore-mentioned proposition is accepted.\"\r\n\r\nThe legal and other difficulties in the way were surmounted and on\r\nFebruary 22, 1854, it was resolved to quit claim the interest of the\r\ntown in the present burial ground to Smith and Carpenter, at such time\r\nas they shall lay off and deed to the corporation a block of ground in\r\nthe Washington cemetery for a \"potter's field,\" which shall contain at\r\nleast three acres. It was conditioned also that Smith and Carpenter\r\nshould give bond for the careful removal of all occupants of the\r\npresent burial ground before making any use of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION OF 1854\r\n\r\nOn April 3, 1854, William W. Smith was elected mayor, William Greene,\r\nAbraham Sines, and Daniel Lothian, councilmen, and William M. Wood,\r\nrecorder. The digging of sand from Iowa avenue was dignified by name of\r\nbringing to grade. This was divided into six parts, and two were let to\r\nW. W. Smith and E. Robins. These paid five dollars apiece for the\r\nprivilege. The other sections remained as before and the avenue was\r\nrendered impassable. J. J. Snouffer was appointed marshal for ensuing\r\nyear and R. C. Rock treasurer. The famous \"hog ordinance,\" which was\r\nintended to keep swine from the street but failed absolutely in its\r\npurpose, was introduced June 28, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION OF 1855\r\n\r\nGeorge Greene was elected mayor April 4, 1855. Members of the council\r\nwere first styled aldermen on the tickets for this year and R. C. Rock,\r\nJoseph A. Love, and J. F. Charles were chosen. W. D. Watrous was the\r\nchoice of the voters for recorder. J. H. Atwell was appointed marshal\r\nand S. D. Carpenter, treasurer. The council was organized into proper\r\ncommittees, indicating that more business came before the body. The\r\nbond of the treasurer had by this time increased to one thousand\r\ndollars. A city attorney was elected June 5, 1855, James J. Child being\r\nthe choice of the council. The report of the finance committee showed a\r\ndeficit--the city's revenues lacking $75.00 of meeting expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION OF 1856\r\n\r\nIsaac Whittam was elected mayor at the April election in 1856, with\r\nWalker, Smith, and Hager, councilmen. The recorder having resigned, D.\r\nM. McIntosh was elected by the council to that office. The ferry\r\nprivileges had passed at death of D. W. King in 1854 to Stephen L.\r\nPollock and afterwards to Bowling & Gilbreath. Both of these failed to\r\npay for license, and the recorder was instructed to collect; Joseph\r\nHollan was appointed road supervisor.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1856, City Attorney James J. Child was instructed to\r\nprepare an amended charter to be submitted to the next legislature.\r\nThis was accepted by council, June 28, 1856. The proposition was then\r\nsubmitted to the voters and adopted 45 to 2. An election for city\r\nofficers under this new charter was ordered to be held at the office of\r\nJ. J. Child August 7, 1856. The votes cast were canvassed by the\r\ncouncil. It was found that 204 votes were cast for mayor, of which\r\nIsaac N. Whittam received 120 and W. W. Smith 84. For recorder and\r\nassessor D. M. McIntosh led with 123; F. P. Huntington 73; E. N. Bates\r\nand S. C. Koontz one each. For treasurer and collector S. C. Koontz\r\nreceived 121 votes and John P. Conkey 79. Charles Weare was elected\r\nmarshal by a vote of 131. In vote for aldermen in the first ward J. T.\r\nWalker was elected and J. J. Snouffer and H. G. Angle were tied.\r\nAlexander Hager and J. F. Charles were chosen to represent the second\r\nward, and Henry S. Ward and W. D. Watrous were duly elected from the\r\nthird ward.\r\n\r\nThis closes the official doings under the old town. The records\r\nconsulted will satisfy and settle all disputed questions as to\r\noffice-holding and the statements here made are correct beyond all\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIALS OF CEDAR RAPIDS FROM 1857 TO 1910\r\n\r\n1857 Isaac N.

Enos. The article\r\nwas written by Mr. Enos himself:\r\n\r\n     \"What constitutes the present city of Cedar Rapids, is\r\n     embraced mainly by sections 21, 22, 27 and 28, in T. 83 N.,\r\n     R. 7 W., in the township of Rapids in Linn county. The\r\n     location is one of the most delightful to be found in any of\r\n     the rich valleys of the west, being on the northeast side of\r\n     the Cedar river, on a plain rising above the river's bed,\r\n     and reaching back nearly half a mile, with but very slight\r\n     depressions or uprisings, serving to render the plat one of\r\n     great convenience for building, and giving a peculiar grace\r\n     to its appearance.\r\n\r\n     \"In the rear of this table-land a somewhat abrupt elevation,\r\n     varying from 20 to 40 feet, occurs, which is covered with a\r\n     luxuriant growth of native oak. Upon this are the most\r\n     beautiful and romantic sites for residences, being\r\n     sufficiently elevated to overlook the entire valley for\r\n     miles in either direction. Back of this the depressions and\r\n     elevations alternate, making this portion of the city a\r\n     series of circular, undulating swells.\r\n\r\n     \"The city proper also extends on the west side of the river\r\n     and embraces numerous other positions which are being\r\n     occupied with rapidity and improved with taste, and though\r\n     not embraced within the present city limits, forms of\r\n     necessity a part of the Valley City.\r\n\r\n     \"Cedar Rapids is situated due west of Chicago, the present\r\n     emporium of the west, and is the present terminus of the\r\n     principal trunk railroad from that city penetrating the\r\n     heart of the northwest. It is 75 miles southwest from\r\n     Dubuque, 80 miles nearly west from Clinton, about the same\r\n     distance from Davenport, 55 miles from Muscatine, and about\r\n     110 from Des Moines--the capital of Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL ADVANTAGES\r\n\r\n     \"Few interior cities are blessed with more natural\r\n     advantages than Cedar Rapids. The rapids in the Cedar river\r\n     are the first met with after leaving the Mississippi, and no\r\n     more occur of any considerable amount for many miles above.\r\n     These afford one of the best water powers in the west, and\r\n     with proper dams would afford power sufficient to run all\r\n     machinery that will ever be required on either side of the\r\n     river, even though our population should reach fifty\r\n     thousand. Surrounding the town for miles is one of the\r\n     richest agricultural districts in the Union, forming a part\r\n     of the Cedar valley country which Professor Owen has taken\r\n     as his type of perfection in fertility. There is a plentiful\r\n     supply of timber for all ordinary uses--numerous groves are\r\n     scattered upon the surrounding hills--giving the appearance\r\n     of an enchanted garden--probably unsurpassed in richness by\r\n     any region of equal extent on the American continent.\r\n\r\n     \"Its position in reference to other towns and cities is such\r\n     as must of necessity make it a great railroad center, and\r\n     several are already projected, and one under contract to\r\n     this city. We shall speak more fully of this class of\r\n     advantages in another portion of this article.\r\n\r\n     \"In point of healthfulness, it will compare favorably with\r\n     any of the river towns, the diseases being chiefly of a\r\n     bilious nature, and yielding readily to very simple\r\n     treatment. This fact applies with very general truth to all\r\n     the valleys of Iowa--while the more elevated districts are\r\n     more free from malaria, they are subject to a disease of a\r\n     more complex and serious character. This may seem fabulous\r\n     to the casual observer, but we feel assured that the\r\n     combined experience of western practitioners will bear\r\n     testimony to the correctness of our statements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK HAWK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WINNEBAGO INDIAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SLAVE DANCE OF THE SAC AND FOX]\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n     \"There is always more or less of interest connected with the\r\n     early days of any city, and it is not until years after that\r\n     the record becomes of value. The pioneer suffers privations\r\n     and trials of which future occupants can realize but little.\r\n     In fact, the honor paid them is seldom equal to their merits\r\n     and oftentimes they are as illy prepared to receive as\r\n     others are to bestow sympathy and praise. Among the first\r\n     settlers of this city were some men of the first character,\r\n     and are yet with us, while others have moved farther on, to\r\n     enjoy what habit has taught them to love, a frontier life,\r\n     and a few have gone down to the gate of common entry, their\r\n     years being full and their memories yet linger, and make us\r\n     glad that we lived with, knew and loved them. Of this number\r\n     we name that generous and true man, D. W. King. Esq., who\r\n     departed from our midst in the autumn of 1854.\r\n\r\n     \"The first man, however, who pitched his tent on the ground\r\n     now occupied by the Valley City, was a counterfeiter and\r\n     horse thief, of no little notoriety, by the name of Shepard,\r\n     who took up his abode and erected a log house on what is now\r\n     Linn street, near the mills, some time in the year 1838.\r\n\r\n     \"D. W. King and Thomas Gainer, the first settlers of any\r\n     advantage to the country, reached here in 1839 and soon\r\n     after made a permanent settlement on the west side of the\r\n     river.\r\n\r\n     \"The house of Shepard was soon found to be the home of a\r\n     lawless band of outlaws, who secreted much of their plunder\r\n     on the islands in the river above the city. John Young and a\r\n     man named Granger were connected with Shepard in their work.\r\n     They stole at one time six horses and made good their escape\r\n     with four of them. Granger was afterwards convicted of\r\n     passing counterfeit money in Chicago and sentenced to the\r\n     Alton prison for four years. The fate of Young is not known\r\n     with certainty, yet there is evidence to induce the belief\r\n     that he was executed for murder, in a neighboring state,\r\n     though he assumed a different name.\r\n\r\n     \"The privations of the first settlers were at times very\r\n     great, and though such as are not uncommon in the history of\r\n     pioneer life, would cause many of our amateurs at the\r\n     present time to sigh for the home of their childhood and a\r\n     place at the luxurious tables of their fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS\r\n\r\n     \"In 1849 D. W. King established ferries for crossing the\r\n     Cedar, and continued to run them up to the time of his\r\n     death. The one doing most of the business was at the Iowa\r\n     avenue crossing. As it is probable that these boats will\r\n     soon, if indeed they have not already made their last\r\n     voyage, a brief note of them may not be out of place in this\r\n     connection. They were self-propellers, being forced across\r\n     the river by the power of the current. A wire rope extended\r\n     across the stream upon which a pulley was placed, and\r\n     connected by means of two ropes to the boat.\r\n\r\n     \"The first dam across the Cedar was commenced in 1842, and\r\n     the first saw mill erected in 1843, and is still running.\r\n\r\n     \"In March, 1843, the lands came into the market. The first\r\n     flouring mill was erected in 1844-5 at a cost of $3,000, by\r\n     the present owner. In 1845 A. Ely erected the second saw\r\n     mill, and the second flouring mill the following year, the\r\n     latter costing about $9,000. In 1848-9 the woolen factory\r\n     was erected at a cost of about $8,000. The first saw mill\r\n     was erected in 1850 by Greene, Legare & Co. This has a chair\r\n     and bedstead factory connected and cost about $4,000. These\r\n     are all propelled by water power. In 1855-6, Greene & Graves\r\n     erected a steam saw mill, and containing also a variety of\r\n     other machinery. The first and only mill erected on the\r\n     west side of the river went into operation in the summer of\r\n     1856. The first steam engine was stationed in this city by\r\n     A. Hager, in his machine shop, sash, blind, and door factory\r\n     in 1855. The second by Greene & Graves, and the third by S.\r\n     L. Pollock.\r\n\r\n     \"The first store was opened by J. Greene, in the building\r\n     now occupied by the postoffice, on the northwest corner of\r\n     Iowa avenue and Washington street.\r\n\r\n     \"The second store was opened by Mr. Cleveland, and C. R.\r\n     Mulford the third. This was located on Commercial street,\r\n     and was destroyed by fire in 1850, being the first building\r\n     thus destroyed in Cedar Rapids. No fire occurred thereafter\r\n     until late in the autumn of 1855, when most of the block\r\n     embraced on the west side of Commercial street, between Iowa\r\n     avenue and Linn street, was consumed. No fire has occurred\r\n     since.\r\n\r\n     \"The postoffice was established in 1847, and J. Greene\r\n     appointed postmaster.\r\n\r\n     \"The first brick buildings were erected in 1844, the\r\n     building on the southwest corner of Iowa avenue and\r\n     Commercial street, and the dwelling house on the northwest\r\n     corner of Iowa avenue and Washington street. The present\r\n     Union House was the first hotel.\r\n\r\n     \"The village of Cedar Rapids was laid out and the plat\r\n     recorded in 1842. At this time, two log buildings\r\n     constituted the village, and the total population was six\r\n     persons.\r\n\r\n     \"A public school house was erected in 1846 or '47, and the\r\n     first school taught by Nelson Felch. This structure is now\r\n     occupied as a dwelling, on the northwest corner of Eagle and\r\n     Madison streets. The first church, Presbyterian, was erected\r\n     in 1850.\r\n\r\n     \"The first newspaper was published in 1851 by D. O. Finch,\r\n     entitled the _Progressive Era_. It was continued under this\r\n     name by various owners and editors until September, 1854,\r\n     when it was purchased by J. L. Enos and F. A. Wilmans, and\r\n     its name changed to the _Cedar Valley Times_ by which name\r\n     it yet flourishes. In politics republican, it is at present\r\n     published by J. G. Davenport. The second paper was\r\n     established in January, 1856, under the editorial management\r\n     of J. L. Enos, entitled the _Cedar Valley Farmer_, but was\r\n     discontinued at the close of the first volume. The _Cedar\r\n     Rapids Democrat_ was the third paper--commenced in June,\r\n     1856, by W. W. Perkins & Co. This is still published.\r\n     Democratic in politics, the _Times_ and the _Democrat_ are\r\n     both good papers, and appear to be well sustained.\r\n\r\n     \"_The Voice of Iowa_ was commenced in January, 1857, under\r\n     the auspices of the Iowa Teachers' Association, Phonetic\r\n     Association, etc., J.

This journal\r\n     has met with more than ordinary success, the circulation\r\n     passing 1,000 during the first three months and commanding\r\n     nearly $1,000 in advertising patronage, thus showing that\r\n     the people of Iowa are aroused to the importance of paying\r\n     due attention to the education of their youth.\r\n\r\n     \"The foundation for a very large graded school was laid in\r\n     the summer of 1856, but owing to the large amount of work\r\n     contracted and the scarcity of workmen, the completion was\r\n     of necessity deferred. It is designed to complete it early\r\n     the coming summer, and when finished will form one of the\r\n     finest educational structures in the state.\r\n\r\n     \"During the past two years the growth of Valley City has\r\n     been equaled by few towns even in the west.

A free bridge\r\n     across the Cedar was commenced in 1855, and is now ready for\r\n     crossing by teams. The chief credit of this structure is due\r\n     to a few, though many stood manfully by the free bridge and\r\n     aided liberally in its erection. A charter for a toll bridge\r\n     was obtained about the time that the free bridge charter\r\n     was procured, which gave rise to a warm controversy in which\r\n     much interest was manifest. The free bridge finally\r\n     triumphed, and its noble arches now span the Cedar with\r\n     every appearance of remaining for many years a proud\r\n     monument to the energy and liberality of those who aided in\r\n     placing it there. We have already intimated that Cedar\r\n     Rapids is the center of a very large and increasing trade,\r\n     and though not destined to become a city of the first\r\n     magnitude, is destined to rank as one of the principal\r\n     interior cities of Iowa. Its railroad connections--immense\r\n     water power--the fertility of the surrounding country and\r\n     the energy of its people will give it rank and importance as\r\n     a manufacturing city, worthy of note.\r\n\r\n     \"Nor is this imaginary, as the following statistics will\r\n     show.

Hall, as to a gavel, at the meeting of\r\ncarpenters of America at Des Moines, 1910, gives some interesting facts\r\nas to early days in Cedar Rapids:\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Sir: In reply to your request for such information as\r\n     I have concerning the small mallet or gavel which you had\r\n     made from a piece of the red cedar shaft, I can only say\r\n     that there is but little to its history. My father, the late\r\n     Nicholas Brodhead Brown, came to what is now the city of\r\n     Cedar Rapids in 1839, but did not remain here at that time.\r\n     He went as far north as Cedar Falls looking for a mill site,\r\n     and returned to this location in 1840. After building the\r\n     first manufacturing plant in Linn county for the Doty\r\n     brothers, a saw mill in Bertram township, located near the\r\n     mouth of Indian creek, he began in 1841 to improve the\r\n     waterfall in the Cedar river at this place. He first built a\r\n     temporary dam then built a saw mill, the second to be built\r\n     in the county, for himself. He then began the building of\r\n     the first flour mill in the county. This mill was completed\r\n     and in operation either in 1843 or 1844, and from this mill\r\n     came the cedar shaft from which the little mallet or gavel\r\n     was made. There is no doubt in my mind about the cedar tree\r\n     from which the mallet was made was cut very close to, and\r\n     perhaps within the present limits of Cedar Rapids. Nicholas\r\n     Brodhead Brown was in all probability the first mechanic who\r\n     used edged tools, to locate in Cedar Rapids. Nor is there\r\n     any doubt in my mind about his making the shaft above spoken\r\n     of. It was the real shaft in the old bolting chest in the\r\n     mill known as Brown's Mill. Mr. Brown by occupation was a\r\n     millwright and through force of circumstances worked at that\r\n     trade for some twelve or fifteen years after his arrival\r\n     here. He especially did all of the millwrighting that he\r\n     could do himself on this mill, working twelve and fourteen\r\n     hours a day for the purpose of getting it into operation as\r\n     soon as possible, as not only he himself needed its income\r\n     but the country all about this locality needed a mill.\r\n\r\n     \"Another of the early mechanics to come to Cedar Rapids was\r\n     Samuel Sherwood, also a millwright. He worked for a time on\r\n     Brown's flour mill, and on the Alexander Ely flour mill, now\r\n     known as the Anchor mill. This was the second mill to begin\r\n     operation in Cedar Rapids. The Ely mill began operating the\r\n     same year as the Brown's, but later on in the year. Another\r\n     of the old-time mechanics, a user of edged tools, was Joseph\r\n     Love. He was the first cabinet-maker to locate in Cedar\r\n     Rapids. Another was John Vardy; he was the second\r\n     cabinet-maker to locate in Cedar Rapids, and was the builder\r\n     of the first house in Cedar Rapids to be constructed of\r\n     sawed lumber. The house still stands--is in use and owned by\r\n     the Stary family. John F. Boyce, the father of William and\r\n     Frank Boyce of this city, was another early mechanic. He\r\n     also was a cabinet-maker. John Patterson, an uncle of Chas.\r\n     A. Calder of this city, was another. He also was a\r\n     cabinet-maker. All of these men worked to a greater or less\r\n     extent at the carpenter's trade. In those days there were no\r\n     trade unions and consequently no limitations on the kind of\r\n     work a mechanic should do. To my mind these men could be\r\n     classed as carpenters as well as millwrights and\r\n     cabinet-makers. I should have said that Samuel Sherwood went\r\n     to Independence from this city and became the founder of the\r\n     milling industry at that thriving little place. I have\r\n     diverged largely from the gavel, but believe it will be\r\n     interesting to yourself and your fraternity to know who the\r\n     first users of edged tools were in this part of Iowa.\r\n\r\n                                  Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                          \"N. E. BROWN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE FIRST RAILROAD CAME TO CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nT. DEVENDORF IN THE SUNDAY REPUBLICAN OF JUNE 10, 1906\r\n\r\nThe population of the city in 1856 was not to exceed 1,200 to 1,500\r\npeople. There was little wealth in the community. No manufacturing\r\nenterprises had as yet located here. The principal dependence of the\r\npeople was in the farming community and the bountiful harvests that\r\nIowa never fails to produce.\r\n\r\nThe one great desire and ambition of the people was for a railroad to\r\nthe east on which they could transport their surplus product to an\r\neastern market. Railroad building had not been very extensive in the\r\nwest, the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska had its track built as far west as\r\nthe Mississippi river and was formulating plans to bridge the river and\r\nextend the road across the fertile prairies of Iowa. Some of our\r\npioneer citizens with shrewd business instincts and confidence in the\r\nrapid settlement and development of the state, on the completion of the\r\nrailroad, became interested in this new project and advocated the\r\ngranting of a loan to them provided the road should be built to or\r\nthrough our growing city. The subject of giving aid to this new\r\nproposed railroad was discussed largely among the people, and on the\r\n1st day of September, 1856, the city council passed a resolution\r\ninstructing the mayor to call an election of the qualified voters of\r\nCedar Rapids to vote on the question, shall the city in its corporate\r\ncapacity subscribe sixty thousand dollars to the capital stock of the\r\nChicago, Iowa & Nebraska railroad and pay for same in bonds issued by\r\nthe city. Said bonds were to bear interest at the rate of ten per cent\r\nper annum, and were to mature 20 years after date at the option of the\r\ncity. The election was called by Mayor Isaac Whittam and held September\r\n22, 1856, and resulted in the very decisive vote of 111 for the\r\nproposition and only 2 against it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD BLAIR BUILDING, NOW THE SITE OF THE KIMBALL\r\nBUILDING]\r\n\r\nThese bonds were to be issued in series as the work on the new road\r\nprogressed, fifteen thousand dollars worth when the contract was let\r\nfor building the road from De Witt to Cedar Rapids; the second series\r\nof fifteen thousand dollars worth when the first five miles of grading\r\nwere completed in Linn county; and the balance of thirty thousand\r\ndollars worth when the grading was finished into the city of Cedar\r\nRapids and the road in operation and cars running as far west as Mt.\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, 1857, Mayor Whittam in a report to the city\r\ncouncil made a statement that he, as representative of the city, had\r\nattended the meeting of the stockholders of the Chicago, Iowa &\r\nNebraska, held on the 25th day of January, 1857, at Clinton and at that\r\ntime had passed over to the railroad company the fifteen bonds of one\r\nthousand dollars each, to which they were entitled, they giving the\r\nrequired stock certificates for same as per agreement. The railroad\r\ncompany also entered into a contract with the city in which they agreed\r\nto pay interest on said bonds and all others to be issued to the\r\nrailroad until such time as the road should be finished and the cars\r\nrunning into the city of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe mayor also complimented the men in charge of the affairs of the\r\nroad as men of means, honor, and energy, and finished his report by\r\npredicting that when the road was completed it would be of great\r\nbenefit and advantage to our young but growing city. But\r\nnotwithstanding the financial aid and the general encouragement given\r\nby the people the road advanced westward slowly and while the grading\r\nhad been nearly completed there were many other things necessary to\r\nbuild a railroad and which could only be had by having the ready money\r\nwith which to buy such supplies. In June, 1857, another petition was\r\npresented to the city council asking that the mayor call an election of\r\nthe legal voters of the city to vote on the question, shall the city\r\nissue its bonds to the amount of forty thousand dollars to aid in\r\npurchasing the iron rails to complete the road to Cedar Rapids, the\r\ncity to be a subscriber to the capital stock of the road to that\r\namount. On July 10, 1857, the mayor called the election to vote on the\r\nproposition, shall the city in its corporate capacity issue its bonds\r\nfor forty thousand dollars, the money to be used to procure iron rails\r\nand for no other purpose. The election was held on July 20, 1857, and\r\nresulted as follows: For the proposition, 104 votes; against 25 votes.\r\n\r\nThese bonds were to be issued in series and were to be paid one-quarter\r\nin 13 years, one-quarter in 14 years, one-quarter in 15 years, and the\r\nbalance in 16 years from date.\r\n\r\nSome time after these bonds were issued and turned over to the railroad\r\ncompany some legal point was raised touching their validity, and this\r\ntogether with the fact that the financial standing of the railroad\r\ncompany in the east among the iron manufacturers was not first class,\r\nmade it necessary that some other plan should be adopted to procure the\r\niron rails to build the road to Cedar Rapids. Heretofore they had found\r\nit practicable to survey and locate and grade a road and pay for the\r\nsame in farm products, dry goods and groceries, etc. But when it came\r\nto buying iron from the manufacturers it required the cash or a\r\nsuitable collateral. But our people were ready to meet this unforeseen\r\nemergency. Six of our early and more wealthy citizens made notes of\r\n$8,000.00 each, each note being signed by each of the other gentlemen,\r\nmaking a joint note of each one and together amounting to the\r\n$48,000.00. These notes were to be used as collateral and to strengthen\r\nup their credit, so that the iron rails could be bought and the road\r\ncompleted to this city. This was purely accommodation paper and the\r\nroad contracted that the interest and principal of these notes should\r\nbe paid by the railroad company from the first net earnings of the\r\ncompany, but in the early years of the road there were no net earnings.\r\nIt was only by the most economical management that the operating\r\nexpenses could be met, and several years elapsed before these notes\r\ngiven to aid the railroad were fully paid. The gentlemen aiding in the\r\nearly construction of the first railroad to Cedar Rapids were Gabriel\r\nCarpenter, George Greene, Sampson C. Bever, J. J. Snouffer, and two\r\nothers whose names are not remembered.\r\n\r\nAfter the railroad was completed and in operation to this place little\r\nwas said in regard to these city bonds. In the proceedings of the city\r\ncouncil June 13, 1860, a resolution was passed authorizing E. H.\r\nSteadman, the mayor of the city, to represent the city at the annual\r\nmeeting of the stockholders of the C., I. & N. Ry., which was to be\r\nheld in Clinton at a later date.\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 1861, a committee was appointed consisting of the mayor,\r\nI. N. Whittam, and Alderman G. Livensbarger who were to examine into\r\nthe legal condition of the city in relation to the $100,000.00 worth of\r\ncity bonds already issued for railroad purposes. What this\r\ninvestigating committee did, and what their conclusions were, are not\r\nmatters of record. Nothing more is said in any of the proceedings of\r\nthe city council in regard to this matter until May 8, 1863, when it\r\nappears from the preamble of a resolution introduced that the railroad\r\ncompany was calling upon the city authorities to comply with the terms\r\nof the contract entered into when the bonds were issued, which was that\r\nthe city should pay the interest on such bonds after the completion of\r\nthe road to this place.\r\n\r\nThe road had been finished and in operation some two years and still no\r\ninterest had been paid and the city made no efforts to collect any sum\r\nfor such purpose. At the meeting of the council May 8, 1863, a\r\nresolution was introduced asking that a committee be appointed to\r\ninvestigate and report on the recorded facts bearing upon this matter\r\nof railroad bonds from its inception to this date. Aldermen McClelland,\r\nDenlinger and Slonaker were desirous of having light on the subject and\r\nvoted for an investigation, but Aldermen Bever, Carroll and Stibbs\r\nvoted in the negative, and this being a tie vote it was decided by the\r\nmayor, who also voted in the negative.\r\n\r\nAt the council meeting held June 11, 1864, another committee to\r\ninvestigate was appointed who was authorized to procure legal advice in\r\nregard to the liability of the city and also meet and confer with the\r\nofficers of the railroad company, and this committee consisting of\r\nAldermen McClelland and E. H. Steadman reported back to the council\r\nthat they had procured legal advice in the matter and from all data and\r\nfacts collected their attorney was of the opinion that the railroad\r\ncompany had no legal claims against the city and that the bonds were\r\nillegal and void.\r\n\r\nIn October of 1864 the same subject came up in the city council and a\r\ncommittee of three consisting of S. C. Bever, H. C. Angle and John\r\nWeare were appointed to confer with the railroad company and get the\r\nbest terms of settlement they could, either by taking reissued stock in\r\npayment or a certain amount of money yearly in full settlement. This\r\ncommittee were prompt in their investigations and reported back to the\r\ncouncil November 4, 1864. Their report was that they had a conference\r\nwith the railroad company and the best compromise they could obtain was\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the city surrender to the company all its claims to stock\r\nin said road.\r\n\r\nSecond. The railroad company would then return to the city $90,000.00\r\nworth of the city bonds already issued together with all coupons on the\r\nbalance, leaving in the hands of the company $10,000.00 worth with all\r\ncoupons cut off to date. This surrendering of bonds to in no way affect\r\nthe legality of the bonds retained, the legal points to be settled\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the council Alderman Bever introduced a resolution\r\ncovering all the points made in the report of the committee that the\r\ncity surrender the stock and that the railroad company return the\r\n$90,000.00 worth of bonds, leaving outstanding and in the hands of the\r\nrailroad company $10,000.00 worth of city bonds.\r\n\r\nOn the yeas and nays being called the following aldermen voted yea:\r\nBever, Denlinger, Holland and Slonaker, and in the negative, Alderman\r\nMcClelland, and the resolution was declared adopted.\r\n\r\nAlderman McClelland then at once offered his resignation as alderman\r\nfrom the Third ward and his resignation was as promptly accepted and\r\nWm. Richmond elected as his successor.\r\n\r\nNothing more appears in the records of the city council bearing on this\r\nquestion of railroad bonds until June 29, 1866, when Alderman Adams of\r\nthe Third ward introduced a resolution that a committee of one\r\nconsisting of Alderman Snouffer be appointed to confer and negotiate\r\nwith Horace Williams, agent of the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska railroad,\r\nfor the surrender of the outstanding bonds, and he was authorized to\r\nrelease and exonerate the railroad company from performing certain acts\r\nthey had previously agreed to do. One was the grading of Jefferson\r\nstreet and another was the grading of the North city park and the\r\nbuilding a fence of oak posts around said park, both of which they had\r\nfailed to do. These agreements of the railroad company the city would\r\nrelinquish, provided the railroad company would return the balance of\r\nthe city bonds in their hands, amounting to $10,000.00.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that Alderman Snouffer failed to make these negotiations\r\nwith Horace Williams as instructed by the city council, at least there\r\nis nothing in the records to show that this committee of one ever made\r\nany report on this subject to the city council.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the city council held May 15, 1868, another committee\r\nwas appointed to investigate and try to induce the railroad company to\r\nrelinquish and return these outstanding city bonds and it is fair to\r\npresume that the committee accomplished something in that direction as\r\nat a subsequent meeting held June 26, 1868, Alderman Leach moved that\r\nthe city treasurer be authorized to receive the city bonds now in the\r\npossession of the Chicago & Northwestern railroad and receipt for same.\r\nThis is the last record to be found in the proceedings of the city\r\ncouncil bearing on this subject of city bonds.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the time the railroad was built into Cedar Rapids it will\r\nbe remembered that little value was placed on the stock. People\r\nsubscribed for the stock and paid their subscriptions as called for\r\nmore to encourage the building of the road than for an investment.\r\nNearly every citizen had some few shares of the stock. They had all\r\ndone their share in getting the road here according to each one's means\r\nand financial ability, and held their stock in the road. It was then\r\nthat men of means with confidence in the rapid growth and advancement\r\nof this great state of Iowa began in a private way gathering up this\r\nstock of the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska R. R., buying up from the small\r\nholders their stock at prices from 25 to 35 cents on the dollar of the\r\npar value and in a few years the small holders had parted with their\r\nholdings and in 1865 there was little or no stock of the Chicago, Iowa\r\n& Nebraska R. R. to be had and in the latter part of that year the road\r\nwas merged into the Chicago & Northwestern system. At what price per\r\nshare the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska went into the Northwestern is not\r\npositively known, but it is generally supposed that one share of the\r\nChicago, Iowa & Nebraska R. R. was good for about three shares of the\r\nnew consolidated Chicago & Northwestern.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE EARLY BRICK HOUSES IN CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nCharles Weare used to say that there was a brick building on the Y. M.\r\nC. A. corner which was torn down many years ago, and which was supposed\r\nto be one of the first brick buildings in Cedar Rapids; it was occupied\r\nby Ingham Wood as a store building. Porter Earle erected one of the\r\nfirst, if not the first, brick building at the corner of First avenue\r\nand Second street where the Union Block is now standing, which was one\r\nof the most commodious buildings of its kind in the city for many\r\nyears. The Michael Bryan family erected one of the first dwelling\r\nhouses of brick about where N. E. Brown's home now stands in 1849 or\r\n1850, and for many years it was one of the best equipped houses in the\r\ncity and the west. This house had an open fire place in every room, and\r\nconsisted of eight rooms. The house was built according to the southern\r\nstyle of architecture. Another member of the Bryan family erected a\r\nstone and cement house about the same time at the corner of Third\r\navenue and Second street, which building was later occupied by the\r\nfamily of William Greene.\r\n\r\nD. M. McIntosh erected a one-story brick building near the present\r\nlibrary in 1850 or 1851, which building is still standing. About the\r\nsame time the father of James Snyder erected a brick dwelling which\r\nstood on South Third street near where the Vardy cottage is located.\r\nGreene's Hotel on First street was a brick structure erected between\r\n1854 and 1855; it had an eighty feet front and ran back toward the\r\nriver about eighty feet. The picture of this building shows that it was\r\na four-story structure, although many claim that it was only a\r\nthree-story building. This buildup was erected by J. J. Snouffer; for\r\nmany years it was the largest and best equipped hotel in this part of\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nPart of the residence of Dr. Skinner was erected by George Berg and was\r\none of the most complete brick structures in this city. Elihu Baker\r\nalso erected a brick residence on the property now occupied by Dr. H.\r\nW. Bender about the early '50s. Sampson C. Bever erected a brick\r\nbuilding on the premises where the Rock Island offices now stand, being\r\na two story structure similar to the Spangler residence which was\r\nerected later across the street. In this structure Mr. Bever installed\r\nthe first hot air furnace used in Cedar Rapids, and a great many of the\r\nearly settlers came to inspect the house, and especially to examine the\r\nhot air furnace which was a new thing in those days.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Cook in the early days erected a brick structure on the corner of\r\nA avenue and Fifth street, which was one of the fine homes for many\r\nyears in this city. S. A. Shattuck built in the early '50s a brick\r\nstructure on Sixth avenue and Fifth street. John Newell, during the\r\nyears 1855 and 1856, erected a double brick structure at the corner of\r\nFifth street and Seventh avenue. The old Seabury house on Eighth avenue\r\nwas erected prior to 1860 and for many years was a landmark in that end\r\nof town. The Barthel house which stood where the Majestic Theatre now\r\nstands was one of the early brick veneer houses in the city and was\r\noccupied by many of the prominent families from time to time.\r\n\r\nR. C. Rock, one of the early merchants, erected a brick house in the\r\nearly days on the premises where George Williams has since erected a\r\nmagnificent mansion. Dr. Wilman, Dr. J. L. Enos and Dr. S. D. Carpenter\r\nerected brick houses in the early days which were landmarks along\r\nSecond avenue up toward Tenth street. The Lawson Daniels brick\r\nresidence was on First avenue between Second and Third streets\r\nadjoining the Thomas Building, and adjoining this was the dwelling of\r\nDr. Thomas, a friend of J. J. Snouffer and a native of Maryland; Dr.\r\nThomas returned to his native state in the '50s. Adjoining these brick\r\ndwellings was also another brick building erected by the old pioneer H.\r\nG. Angle and occupied by him as a residence for many years.\r\n\r\nAnother substantial brick dwelling was erected by John Graves on B\r\navenue and Fourth street, being a two-story brick building with an\r\nupper and lower porch. The old Gillette house was on the east side of\r\nFifth street where William S. Bye now resides; it was known as the\r\nGillette house. Mr. Gillette being the brother-in-law of the late W. D.\r\nWatrous.\r\n\r\nAnother large and commodious brick dwelling house was a two-story\r\nstructure erected on Fifth street between B and C avenues and near what\r\nis known now as Whittam Park. Adjoining this was the Koontz house,\r\noccupied by Dr. Koontz and his family for many years. The Tryon house\r\nwas also a brick structure erected near the corner of Third avenue and\r\nSecond street; Mr. Tryon was a surveyor and well known in the early\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nNearly all the brick used in the early days was made by a Mr. Geeslan\r\nwho operated a brick yard near what is now known as the \"Lame Johnny\"\r\nplace. Brick was cheap, labor was low and the cost of erecting these\r\ndwellings in that day was much lower than later. It is said that Sam\r\nStambaugh in the early days worked as a brick mason and walked home to\r\nBertram every night, the wages paid being about $1.00 a day, which was\r\nconsidered high. It is also said that during the '50s Cedar Rapids had\r\nmore commodious homes than any other town of its size in Iowa. It was\r\nmade up largely of a brainy, wide-awake, enterprising lot of men, such\r\nas N. B. Brown, H. G. Angle, the Greenes, Earles, Elys, Daniels, Macks,\r\nWeares, Bevers, and many others who had drifted into the town and who\r\nsoon built up an enterprising little town, engaging in various\r\nventures, not always successful, but they had Cedar Rapids before the\r\nworld so that they finally landed the railroad which henceforth made\r\nthe town. It is said by the late Charles Weare that \"when they first\r\nstarted a newspaper there were no settlers in the town, but they had to\r\nuse a newspaper to boom the town with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME STRENUOUS DAYS IN THE OLDEN TIMES\r\n\r\nFROM THE CEDAR RAPIDS REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY, JUNE 10, 1906\r\n\r\nAn ordinance creating a fire department was introduced in the council\r\nin January, 1869, and it was passed February 12, 1869. This ordinance\r\nwas lengthy. It stipulated what officers should be appointed, what\r\ntheir duties were, how many fire companies to each engine, how many men\r\nto each company and many other details. One of the provisions of this\r\nfirst and original ordinance was that the fire chief should be\r\nappointed by the council.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1869, the fire company which had already been organized\r\nbut not officially recognized by the city council, presented a petition\r\nto the council, asking that P. C. Lusk be appointed as fire chief. At a\r\nsubsequent meeting a vote was taken on the election of a fire chief\r\nwith the following result:\r\n\r\nP. C. Lusk, who was the choice of the fire department, received four\r\nvotes and J. J. Snouffer one vote. Lusk having received a majority of\r\nthe votes cast was declared elected chief of the fire department. At\r\nthe meeting held April 9, 1869, the chief of the fire department\r\npresented the names of the members of the first company which was\r\nstyled \"The Steam Fire Engine Co., No. 1.\" It was organized under\r\nOrdinance No. 78. Mr. Lusk reported the names of sixty members,\r\nincluding officers, and asked the council to confirm them, which was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe officers of this company were as follows:\r\n\r\n     Foreman--Geo. A. Lincoln.\r\n     Assistant Foreman--M. T. Bell.\r\n     Secretary--E. W. S. Otto.\r\n     Treasurer--W. B. Stewart.\r\n     Hose Captain--D. A. Dingman.\r\n     Assistant Hose Captain--N. H. Martin.\r\n     Engineer--W. Berkley.\r\n     Stoker--H. S. Gilmore.\r\n\r\nSome of the \"high privates\" in this first organized fire company of\r\nCedar Rapids were as follows: Al Jacobs, Richard Cornish, C. E. Calder,\r\nLyman Ayers, Geo. Rhodes, Ed. Buttolph, John H. Smith, H. S. Bever, H.\r\nE. Witwer, H. Hale, Geo. Hasse, John Bryan, Walter L. Clark, L. L.\r\nCone, Chas. L. Morehead, A. S. Mershon, Ely E. Weare, James Snyder,\r\nJohn Shearer, Baxter McQuinn, W. J. Wood, Richard Moorhead, Don Harris,\r\nLowell Bressler, N. Rudolph, Ira Taft, and twenty-seven others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTROSE HOTEL, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\nEarly in April a hook and ladder company was organized and on April 16,\r\n1869, was confirmed by the council as a part of the fire department of\r\nCedar Rapids. The officers of the company were as follows:\r\n\r\n     Foreman--S. D. Fleck.\r\n     First Assistant--J. S. Dickinson.\r\n     Secretary--Geo. A. Gault.\r\n     Recorder and Treasurer--J. G. Krebs.\r\n\r\nSamuel A. Lilly. H. C. Morehead, James Fowler, P. C. Garrett, J. C.\r\nAdams, Samuel Spalding, J. A. Hart, Joseph Lilly, J. M. Chambers, T.\r\nSnook, J. J. Calder, G. M. Howlett, C. D. Pettibone and six others\r\nconstituted the active membership of this organization.\r\n\r\nThe official life of Chief Engineer Lusk was very brief and was marked\r\nby continued strife and dissension among the members of the department.\r\nHe became _persona non grata_ to the council and charges were preferred\r\nagainst him. July 13, 1869, Alderman Hill introduced a resolution\r\nreciting that while the chief engineer could not be declared guilty of\r\nintentional fraud he was indiscreet in many things and his influence\r\nfor good in the department had been so impaired that his resignation\r\nwas demanded. This did the business, and on July 23 he resigned. W. B.\r\nLeach was appointed chief engineer for the remainder of the term, and\r\npeace and good feeling prevailed in the department.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1870, after the inauguration of the new council of which W.\r\nB. Leach was mayor, a petition of the fire department was presented in\r\nwhich they asked the council to appoint Geo. A. Lincoln as chief\r\nengineer of the department. Another petition was also presented, signed\r\nby many citizens, asking that W. D. Watrous be appointed chief engineer\r\nof the department. On the 25th of March, a ballot being ordered, Geo.\r\nA. Lincoln received three votes and W. D. Watrous three votes,\r\nwhereupon the mayor voted for Lincoln and declared him elected to the\r\nposition of chief engineer, and on the 26th day of March he was duly\r\nqualified and took the oath of office.\r\n\r\nShortly after Mr. Lincoln assumed the authority vested in the office of\r\nchief engineer of the fire department, an element of discord arose in\r\nthe council and an effort was made to secure by legislation and\r\ndiplomacy what they had failed to accomplish when the vote was taken in\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nIt was thought the original ordinance passed in January, 1869, was\r\nfaulty and should be amended and the ordinance committee was directed\r\nto make such amendments as were necessary or to prepare an entirely new\r\nordinance.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1870 the committee had prepared an ordinance which\r\nwas practically the same as the old one. The only radical change was in\r\nthe manner of electing a chief engineer. The new ordinance placed the\r\nelection of the officer with the electors after the year 1870 and a new\r\nsection was added which read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"No person shall be eligible to the office of chief engineer unless he\r\nbe a resident of said city at least one year and shall have attained\r\nthe age of twenty-five years.\"\r\n\r\nTo understand the force of this last clause in the ordinance it will be\r\nnecessary to remark that at this time Mr. Lincoln was only twenty-three\r\nyears old. This ordinance, the records say, was passed July 29, 1870,\r\nbut it was found necessary to amend it and it was not until ordinance\r\nNo. 98 was passed on September 30, 1870, that the council felt safe in\r\nelecting a new chief engineer to take the place of the one so skilfully\r\nlegislated out of office. On the 15th of October, 1870, A. R. West\r\nbecame the chief engineer of the fire department by the vote of the\r\ncouncil. After the election of Mr. Lincoln during the spring and summer\r\nof 1870 it was uncertain whether the city of Cedar Rapids had a fire\r\ndepartment or not, and it was also a question as to the authority\r\npossessed by the chief. There was much discord and bitterness among\r\nsome of the members of the fire organizations. The city council was far\r\nfrom being harmonious and rarely acted in unison in legislating for the\r\nwell being of the fire department. The citizens who had labored long\r\nand earnestly in this work of procuring fire apparatus felt that they\r\nhad a right to demand that this bickering and personal contention\r\nbetween the organized fire department and the duly elected city council\r\nshould be ended, but the strife continued. Early in the administration\r\nof Mr. Lincoln as chief of the department a communication was presented\r\nto the city council in which the petitioners, after recounting their\r\nmany grievances, made the claim that the election of Mr. Lincoln was\r\nunparliamentary, unfair and contrary to the wishes of the department\r\nand to a great majority of the property holders, and that while the\r\npetitioners were willing to obey all ordinances of the city and the\r\nruling of any legally appointed officer as chief of the fire\r\ndepartment, they did not consider themselves lawfully bound to give any\r\nheed or attention to the said Geo. A. Lincoln. That they as members of\r\nthe fire department would pay no attention to the said unlawfully\r\nelected chief engineer nor to any order coming from him. This petition\r\nwas signed by Sam Neidig, C. W. Eaton, G. M. Howlett, Sam Lilly, Chas.\r\nHubbard, J. C. Adams, Thos. Snook, and fifteen others.\r\n\r\nSome time later the chief engineer made a report to the city council as\r\nthe ordinance directed he should do, giving the necessary information\r\nin regard to the efficiency of the department and its probable needs\r\nfor the future, but the council refused to accept it as the report of\r\nthe chief engineer, making the broad claim that there was no fire\r\ndepartment or a legally elected chief engineer and this was backed up\r\nby the opinion of the city attorney. Mr. Lincoln, not to be thwarted by\r\nthe city council in refusing to listen to his report, was obliged to\r\nhave it published in the city papers and some extracts are made here,\r\nshowing the friendly feeling existing between him and some members of\r\nthe city council. He reported that the steam engine was in good shape\r\nexcepting that the grate had burned out and the committee on the fire\r\ndepartment had refused to get it repaired. The hose was poor and not in\r\ncondition to stand the pressure necessary in case of a large fire. This\r\nwas owing to the committee on fire refusing to have the tower on the\r\ncity hall arranged so the hose could be hung up to dry after having\r\nbeen used. Many small bills for supplies used by the department, and\r\nwhich were necessary for the running of the steamer, were hung up and\r\nnot allowed, and in speaking of the cistern which the city had built he\r\nreports that one of the aldermen had the keys of the same and refused\r\nto turn them over to him and as to the amount of water in same he could\r\nmake no report.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of Mr. A. R. West to the position of chief engineer,\r\nthe old original No. 1 Fire Engine Company, or a large proportion of\r\nits members, at one of its meetings passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, The city council has seen proper to persecute and\r\n     finally to declare us not an organized fire company, and\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, We who compose the Fire Engine Company No. 1 have\r\n     since organization labored faithfully to make the department\r\n     as efficient as possible and have in all cases discharged\r\n     our duties as firemen, therefore\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That we turn over to the city council all the\r\n     fire apparatus in our possession. That we refuse to offer\r\n     our services as firemen so long as any member of the city\r\n     council who has been persistent in our persecution shall\r\n     remain in said council.\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That we condemn the city council in thus\r\n     deliberately and intentionally using their power to cripple\r\n     and destroy the efficiency of the fire department.\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, That we preserve our company organization and\r\n     that each and every one refuse to touch, use or handle any\r\n     of the fire apparatus belonging to the city of Cedar\r\n     Rapids.\"\r\n\r\nThis old, original company, No. 1, was then a fire company to all\r\nintents and purposes, acting under the original organization, with most\r\nof the original members belonging, but they had no apparatus, no\r\nengines, nothing to use in case of fire. But this did not long remain.\r\nA subscription was started among the members of the company, and they\r\nwith the aid of their friends and citizens soon had subscribed a sum\r\nsufficient to buy a substantial hand engine of a late pattern, together\r\nwith 5,000 feet of new hose, a new hose cart, and also to put up a\r\ncomfortable and neat engine house in which to hold their meetings and\r\nto shelter their engine and the other necessary equipment.\r\n\r\nThis engine was purchased of Josiah Gates & Son, Lowell, Mass., and\r\ncost the sum of $800, which amount was paid in cash from the proceeds\r\nof the many subscriptions. It was called the E. S. Hill Independent\r\nFire Company, in honor of E. S. Hill who was the patron saint in all\r\ntheir contentions with the city council, being an alderman from the\r\nFirst ward, and also one of the most liberal subscribers to the fund to\r\nprocure the engine, he having led the subscription list with $200.00.\r\n\r\nThe hose cart was procured from Quincy, Ill., where it had been\r\npreviously used by that city, and cost $300.00 all complete. The hose\r\nto the amount of 500 feet cost the sum of $500.00. The material for the\r\nbuilding of the engine house was obtained free from the local dealers\r\nand the construction was almost all done by the members of the company.\r\n\r\nAfter this company had procured their apparatus and were domiciled in\r\ntheir new building they developed into a very aggressive company of\r\nfire fighters, and it was the boast of some of its members that they\r\ncould get out to a fire, extinguish the flames and be ready to return\r\nhome before the steam engine company could get to the fire and be ready\r\nto work.\r\n\r\nA. R. West, who had been duly elected chief engineer of the fire\r\ndepartment, together with John T. Hamilton, who was appointed assistant\r\nfire engineer, succeeded after much labor in bringing order out of the\r\nchaos that had so long existed in the affairs of the fire department.\r\n\r\nThe steam engine, together with the hook and ladder equipment, was put\r\ninto the hands of a newly organized company, most of the members of\r\nwhich had not been identified with any of the previous unpleasantness\r\nbetween the council and the fire department.\r\n\r\nFor the next five years Cedar Rapids had two fire departments, the one\r\nbelonging to the city and under municipal control, and the other\r\ndenominated the \"Independent,\" owning their own equipment and subject\r\nto no official orders from the city.\r\n\r\nThis continued until the advent of the Cedar Rapids Water Co., who put\r\nin their system of waterworks and established hydrants in all parts of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. ROCK'S REMINISCENCES\r\n\r\nMrs. R. C. Rock, one of the earliest of the pioneers, is still living\r\nin a serene and vigorous old age. She is a relative of Judge Greene,\r\nand came west to Dubuque in 1849 at his request to assist him in\r\ngetting out his first volume of Iowa Reports, which was printed in New\r\nYork. She later came to Cedar Rapids with the judge and assisted\r\nmaterially in getting ready for the press and in proof reading the\r\nmatter for the other volumes of his Reports. The members of the supreme\r\ncourt would frequently gather in Cedar Rapids in chambers to prepare\r\ntheir opinions and to O. K. them for publication. Mrs. Rock did much of\r\nthe law copying for these judges. Their decisions were turned over to\r\nher to record and to edit for publication. She says Judge Williams was\r\nflowery in his language and it became necessary to do a good deal of\r\ntrimming of his decisions so as to condense them properly before\r\npublication, as attorneys were not so much interested in the language\r\nof the court as they were in getting quickly at the meat of the\r\ndecisions. Mrs. Rock did not hesitate to do a great amount of pruning,\r\nwith the result that Judge Greene received many compliments over the\r\nimprovements noted in his second volume as compared with the matter\r\nthat appeared in the first publication.\r\n\r\nFor a time Mrs. Rock did editorial work on the _Progressive Era_, which\r\nwas published from the Greene Bros. building. J. O. Stewart was then\r\n\"devil\" in the office, and many a time brought to her the proofs of her\r\ncontributions. The files of this early Linn county newspaper were\r\nburned in a fire which destroyed the publication office, so that now\r\nthere are in existence but a few scattered issues. An early one was\r\ngiven a few years ago to the Masonic Library by Mrs. Rock who found it\r\nby accident among some of her effects.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rock came west by boat from Buffalo to Milwaukee, and then by\r\nstage to Dubuque in 1849. The next year she removed to Cedar Rapids,\r\ncoming here by stage over the Old State Road laid out from Iowa City to\r\nDubuque by Engineer Barney of Washington, D. C. This road was a very\r\ncrooked one. His son, W. J. Barney, on being twitted about its many\r\nwindings replied that he believed his father was entirely sober when he\r\nstaked out the route, and that its numerous windings were necessary to\r\navoid the sloughs and swamps.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rock well remembers some of the trips she made on the old stage\r\nfrom Dubuque to Cedar Rapids. It was customary to make 25 miles of the\r\njourney the first day. On one trip on arriving at the usual stopping\r\nplace it was found impossible to obtain any hay for the weary horses.\r\nAfter a further drive of five miles a stop was made at a farm cabin, it\r\nbeing customary for the settlers at any place to provide entertainment\r\nfor travellers. Here they found feed for the horses, but they were told\r\nthere was no bread or flour in the house, the man not having returned\r\nfrom the distant mill with his grist. There was some milk, and at last\r\na little flour or meal was discovered. The two were mixed and put in a\r\npan on the stove to cook. Unfortunately it was so badly burned that it\r\ncould not be eaten, and the travelers were compelled to go to bed\r\nsupperless. During the night the man returned with his grist, and Mrs.\r\nRock and party had a fairly good breakfast of saleratus biscuits and\r\npork.\r\n\r\nOne day while living in Cedar Rapids Mrs. Rock learned of the Spirit\r\nLake massacre. She states the people here for a time had a genuine\r\nIndian scare, but nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rock has distinct recollections of prairie fires here. She says\r\nthey were beautiful but terrible to behold. They were especially\r\nprevalent every fall on the west side, and many a time has she seen the\r\nbright flames cover the hills that are now incorporated in the city of\r\nCedar Rapids. Judge Greene had early planted a large orchard at Mound\r\nFarm, and once after it had borne fruit for a number of years it was\r\nthreatened with destruction from a prairie fire. All Cedar Rapids went\r\nout to help fight the flames. They saved the orchard at this time, but\r\nlater the trees were killed by an unusually severe winter.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Cedar Rapids were very patriotic during the war years.\r\nThey made all the uniforms for the boys of Col. T. Z. Cook's company,\r\nand supplied them with generous quantities of bandages and lint. It\r\nhappened that after the severe engagement at Wilson's Creek those\r\nbandages were the only ones available on the field. Mrs. Rock's\r\nbrother, then 18 years old, enlisted under Colonel Cook. After the\r\nhundred days for which the company had entered the service he\r\nre-enlisted under Captain Stibbs, being wounded at Ft. Donelson. He\r\nthen again entered the army under Captain Coulter, father of Ed.\r\nCoulter now living in Cedar Rapids, and was later killed in the south.\r\nCaptain Coulter's company was known as the \"Brindle Brigade,\" because\r\nit was made up of men from so many regiments that had disbanded.\r\n\r\nThere were some lawless people among the earliest settlers, says Mrs.\r\nRock, and they occasionally appropriated a horse or two, necessitating\r\nsome corrective action by the community. On one occasion N. B. Brown\r\nborrowed a horse from a man whose discipline was decreed and went to\r\nWestport to secure tar for the purpose. At dusk the horse was returned\r\nto the barn. C. C. Cook seized the individual, assisted by Gainor and\r\nothers. His legs were tied and he was taken to the side hill on B\r\navenue where his clothes were removed and he was treated to a coat of\r\ntar and feathers. The following day he appeared among his fellows, and\r\nmy relator states there was \"not even a smell of tar about him,\" but\r\nthe treatment proved effectual.\r\n\r\nOne of the early settlers, Joe Leverich, had a fine library, was a\r\ngreat reader, a shrewd observer of human character, and his descendants\r\nare people of intelligence and high morality. Among those who came\r\nlater were Dr. J. F. Ely and Dr. S. D. Carpenter in 1849, Judge Greene\r\nin 1850. They were men of education and attainment. Soon followed Miss\r\nLegare of Washington, D. C., the Bryans, and Stoneys from Charleston,\r\nS. C., A. S. Belt, a lawyer, son of Commodore Belt, of Maryland, the\r\nTaylors from Virginia, and many others whose character and culture gave\r\nmoral and mental tone to the growing community. In religious\r\nintercourse a broad and kindly feeling characterized all, and now in\r\n1910, the same feeling prevails. The Daniels brothers erected a store,\r\nthree stories, where the Masonic Temple now stands. In 1849 the Green\r\nBrothers erected a three-story brick building diagonally across, the\r\nfirst floor being used for merchandizing, the second for Judge Greene's\r\noffice and ware rooms. In one large room in this building Miss Calder,\r\nfrom New York, opened a school for girls in the fall of 1850. In a hall\r\non the third floor, a Masonic lodge was organized the same year. Miss\r\nCalder [Mrs. Rock] drew designs for the emblems and attended to making\r\nthe aprons.\r\n\r\nThe first district school house was built several years previous on the\r\nlot on Second avenue and Fifth street. The Cedar Rapids Business\r\nCollege is now located on this site. This was used also for religious\r\nservices on Sunday. Squire Abbe's daughter taught the first school, and\r\nMiss Louisa Roberts, daughter of the Congregational minister, the\r\nsecond. Squire Abbe was a member of the Territorial Legislature.\r\n\r\nMiss Calder's school prospered; and two other teachers were secured;\r\none from New York for the piano, and another, Miss Parkhurst, to assist\r\nin the English branches. She was a recent graduate from Miss Sill's\r\nseminary at Rockford, Illinois. Miss Calder herself continued with some\r\nof the English grades, also with French and Drawing. Pupils were\r\nattracted from neighboring towns, Marion, Vinton, Dubuque, Muscatine,\r\nBurlington, Fairfield, etc., but after a few years, failing health\r\ncaused her to relinquish it to two young ladies from Ohio, and within\r\ntwo years it ceased to exist. The following year Miss Calder married R.\r\nC. Rock, a hardware merchant. About the same date the Rev. Williston\r\nJones, Presbyterian minister, opened a school for boys in his private\r\nresidence, and after a few months turned it over to Mr. Blakeley, when\r\nit was transferred to the \"Little Muddy\" church. Mr. Blakeley's public\r\nexamination was the occasion of a lampoon by Dr. S. D. Carpenter, but\r\nhe was a fine man and a good teacher. Geo. E. W. Leonard was financial\r\nagent for this school.\r\n\r\nThese efforts resulted in Rev. Mr. Jones securing from Daniel Coe, of\r\nGreen county, New York, a gift of $1,000.00 with which was purchased\r\neighty acres of land adjoining the town, a part of which is now\r\noccupied by Coe College and from which numerous lots were sold to aid\r\nin establishing this school. The first college building was erected by\r\nsubscription of the citizens. The only surviving incorporator of the\r\ninstitution is Dr. Seymour D. Carpenter, now residing in Chicago, aged\r\nabout eighty-four.\r\n\r\nThe first religious services were Methodist, held in the district\r\nschool house, and their circuit riders came every two weeks. They\r\norganized a Sunday school and insisted on a union school. The\r\nPresbyterians, New School, effected the first organization in 1847 in\r\nMr. Vardy's shop, corner Third street and Sixth avenue. They, too,\r\nworshiped in the school house. Dr. Ely read the sermons, but their\r\nfirst minister, Mr. Roberts, of Marion, was a Congregationalist. He was\r\nsucceeded by Rev. W. Jones, before mentioned. The first Episcopal\r\nclergyman was Rev. James Keeler, who found an occasional opening for\r\nservice in the school house, but soon came to using Miss Calder's\r\nschool room for regular Sunday service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN LAND WAS DIRT CHEAP IN CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nReal estate investments have always been successful and profitable in\r\nCedar Rapids, and probably will always continue to be so. As shown in\r\nother articles, the land upon which Cedar Rapids is built was\r\noriginally owned by five men, Judge Greene, Nicholas Brown, Addison\r\nDaniels, Wm. Sanford, and Alexander Ely. The division of the property\r\nwas made in 1849 as is shown elsewhere, and it is from that time that\r\nmost of the real estate transfers were made. All the gentlemen made\r\nfortunes from their speculations.\r\n\r\nHow these five gentlemen came to be possessed of all the land in the\r\ncity of Cedar Rapids would make an interesting story, especially if the\r\nprices they paid for each lot could be secured. They doubtless bought\r\nup the claims for almost nothing. We get some inkling of how the lots\r\ncame into their possession by a curious old document which was\r\ndeposited by Mr. C. G. Greene with the curator of the museum for the\r\nsemi-centennial week.\r\n\r\nThe property mentioned in it is the Grand Hotel corner, and this is a\r\ncopy of it:\r\n\r\n     \"Received, Cedar Rapids, Sept. 7, 1848, of John L. Shearer,\r\n     one yoke of oxen valued at thirty-five dollars, in full for\r\n     Lot 9 in block No. 23 in the town of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\n                                                   \"Geo. Greene.\"\r\n\r\nBut it appears that Judge Greene did not think he had a very great\r\nbargain, for only seven months later, in May of the following year, the\r\ncounty records show that this same lot upon which the Grand Hotel now\r\nstands, and forty feet additional, 120×150 feet in all, was sold by\r\nJudge Greene back to John L. Shearer for $75. Up to 1865 it passed\r\nthrough several hands, with slightly increased value, when it was sold\r\nby Henry McBride to Charles Weare for $1,100. Weare sold immediately to\r\nS. B. Fleek for $1,500, and Fleek sold it in 1871 to E. M. Greene for\r\n$9,000. In 1877 Greene sold 80×140 feet to John T. Waterhouse for\r\n$10,000, and this property which originally brought $75, could not now\r\nbe purchased, if unimproved, for less than $100,000. It is now held by\r\na syndicate.\r\n\r\nWilliam Stewart originally owned the ground where the Cook & Laurance\r\nstore used to be located. He traded an Indian pony for it in the early\r\ndays, and held it until 1873, when he sold it for $7,500.\r\n\r\nThe property upon which the Calder buildings now stand, 60×140 feet,\r\nwas also originally owned by Judge Greene. He sold it to Alexander Ely,\r\nwho sold it to Harvey Higley and Samuel Hook, and they in turn sold it,\r\nin 1850, to Frederick Miles for $82. Miles held it until 1875, when he\r\nsold it for $1,500. Mr. Calder's friends told him at the time that he\r\nwas throwing his money away, but now it doesn't look that way, as the\r\nland unimproved would sell for many times that sum.\r\n\r\nWhere the Golden Eagle store is now located, 60×140 feet was sold in\r\n1848 by James M. Berry to Homer Bishop for $150. After passing through\r\nseveral hands the ground was purchased by P. Mullally and W. W. and M.\r\nA. Higley, who, in 1874, sold 60×140 feet of it to John T. Waterhouse\r\nfor $12,300.\r\n\r\nThe ground where George A. Mullin's store is located, 120×140 feet, was\r\nsold by Mary A. Ely in 1853, to D. M. McIntosh, for $350. H. G. Angle\r\nbought it in 1854 for $600. It was afterwards taken by creditors, and\r\nwas held by them until 1875, when it was sold to J. T. Waterhouse for\r\n$13,000.\r\n\r\nThese are cases illustrative of the wonderful growth in the value of\r\nCedar Rapids real estate. It will of course some day find its level,\r\nand will very probably go above it, but it is quite safe to say that\r\njust now it is worth all that is paid for it.\r\n\r\nEvery time a real estate transfer is made it is amusing to get an \"old\r\ncitizen\" started, and have him bemoan his failure to invest a few\r\ndollars in a block or so twenty years ago, and hold on to it until the\r\npresent time. If he had done so he would have been rich--but the\r\ntrouble is he didn't do it.\r\n\r\nThomas McGregor, who was working for a Mr. Robinson in the fifties, was\r\noffered lots where the Quaker Oats plant is now located at $10 a lot,\r\nbut needed the money to keep his family on as he got only 75 cents per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOn arrival of the first steamer in Cedar Rapids lots were offered free\r\nto passengers and crew in case they wanted to locate. Many lots were\r\ngiven away by real estate boomers in those days to increase the\r\npopulation of the city. Many of these lots were later lost because the\r\nowners thought so little of their value that they let them go to tax\r\nsales.\r\n\r\nProperty on Second avenue between Second and Fourth streets was then\r\nonly residence property, sand hills, and the like. Now all of this has\r\nbecome valuable business property and is held at not less than $1,000 a\r\nfront foot, and still going higher. These lots were sold less than\r\nfifty years ago at $25 a lot.\r\n\r\nProperty on Third avenue was even less valuable than property on Second\r\navenue. With the location of the station here with the hotels, bank\r\nbuildings, etc., lots are now selling at fabulous prices. With the\r\nadvance of prices rents have also advanced. I. C. Emery some twenty\r\nyears ago had the same location which he has recently gone into, and\r\npaid at that time about one-third of the rent he pays today. Rents on\r\nthe ground floor in the Kimball building, the Ely block, the Dows\r\nblock, and in others of the old buildings have gradually advanced in\r\naccordance with the advance in prices of the real estate holdings, and\r\npretty much in the same ratio.\r\n\r\nLarge office buildings have been erected from time to time, and it has\r\nbeen said that the city would never demand such quarters. It has only\r\nbeen a little time till there has been a demand for more office and\r\nstore buildings on a larger scale and these have been filled without\r\nany trouble.\r\n\r\nThe property where is located the Denecke building was once used for a\r\nlivery stable, and the property on which is located the Magnus block\r\nwas occupied as a dwelling house. These properties were traded back and\r\nforth for a song. The O'Haras finally snapped them up and began\r\nimprovement and were thought at the time to be crazy. Mr. Denecke then\r\nbegan purchasing and the same was said of him. When Mr. Magnus made his\r\npurchase of the block in 1894, during the depression, they said he\r\nwould never get his money out of it. Today he has been offered more\r\nthan twice what he paid and refuses to consider the offer. The corner\r\nwhere the Security bank is now located had been sold and re-sold, and\r\nno one thought it worth anything, and when G. F. Van Vechten purchased\r\na few feet for a bank location many years ago the people of the town\r\nstill thought it impossible that this corner would be worth so much.\r\nThe bank later had to pay a handsome price in order to get ground\r\nenough to make the improvements desired, and would have made money by\r\nhaving bought much earlier. The Taft building was purchased by the\r\nlate Judge Hubbard some ten years ago at $55,000, and is now worth\r\ntwice that sum.\r\n\r\nHowever old settlers say that for years real estate in Cedar Rapids did\r\nnot move and it was a drug on the market, and the rents were not in\r\nratio with the values. For years town lots were peddled about the town\r\nand traded for stocks of goods, for old horses, and other personal\r\nproperty, and it was always thought that the person who obtained the\r\nreal estate got the poor end of the bargain.\r\n\r\nWilliam Stone, Osgood Shepherd, Thomas Gainer, David King, H. G. Angle,\r\nand others of the early settlers did not know what a mine they\r\npossessed had they only hung on long enough. Stone settled on the Iowa\r\nriver and later left for Wisconsin, and Shepherd soon followed, all\r\nthinking he had made a good thing by selling his squatter rights to\r\nBrown and his friends.\r\n\r\nDr. E. L. Mansfield arrived in Cedar Rapids in 1847, going overland to\r\nCalifornia in 1850. He traded the west one-half of the block between\r\nThird and Second avenues west, and between First and Second streets for\r\na rifle, which was considered a high price in those days. On this lot\r\nDr. Mansfield erected a large dwelling house and lived there for many\r\nyears. He purchased the lot on which the Whelihan drug store now stands\r\nfor $600, and the lot adjoining many years later for $10,000, at what\r\nwas then considered a very high price. Thus the property of 140 feet\r\nfronting on Second street and 120 feet fronting on Second avenue were\r\npurchased for less than $12,000, property which is now some of the most\r\nvaluable in Cedar Rapids. Dr. Mansfield also held part of the property\r\nwhich was later purchased by the Cedar Rapids Savings Bank, and was\r\nheld by him up to the time of his death. This had been purchased at an\r\nearly day at low prices, when it was nothing but the cheapest kind of\r\nrenting property.\r\n\r\nA. C. Taylor, holder of much valuable real estate in Cedar Rapids,\r\nfirst owned the property where the First Christian church now stands.\r\nHe also purchased the property on First avenue near the Union block.\r\nMr. Taylor is the second oldest merchant in Cedar Rapids, and has not\r\nmoved more than a block from the time he came here to locate in part of\r\nthe postoffice on the alley where the Masonic Temple now stands. In\r\nspeaking of rents, Mr. Taylor says that he has been surprised at the\r\nway rents have gone up year by year.\r\n\r\nOsgood Shepherd, of whom it is said that he jumped Wilbert Stone's\r\nclaim, held this claim till 1847, when he disposed of his squatter\r\ninterest in what became Cedar Rapids to N. B. Brown, George Greene, H.\r\nW. Gray, A. L. Roach, and S. H. Tryon for the sum of $3,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST DECORATION DAY CELEBRATION IN CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nFROM THE CEDAR RAPIDS REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY, JUNE 3, 1906\r\n\r\nWhen was the first Decoration Day celebration in Cedar Rapids? That is\r\na question which many might find it hard to answer, and the story of\r\nthe preparations for that day and of the day itself is so interesting\r\nthat it is well worth a place here. There were comparatively few graves\r\nto decorate on that occasion. Not many of those who fought in the war\r\nhad passed over the great divide in the year 1873, more than thirty\r\nyears ago. Men whose heads are silvered and their steps trembling were\r\nthen young and they marched firmly to the cemetery to take part in the\r\nexercises on that first Decoration Day. Since that time many of them\r\nhave been laid beneath the sod and their comrades have done for them\r\nwhat they helped to do for others.\r\n\r\nThe day was made memorable by an eloquent and beautiful address by the\r\nlate Judge Hubbard, a man who always loved the flag and the men who\r\nfought for it. Patriotism was one of the subjects that always lay\r\nnearest his heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. C. BEVER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS GAINER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. D. WALN An Early Settler]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. ELIAS SKINNER]\r\n\r\nThe first meeting to arrange for the Decoration Day exercises was held\r\nMay 8, 1873. The Cedar Rapids _Daily Republican_ of the following\r\nmorning has the following interesting account of the meeting:\r\n\r\n     \"The meeting called for the purpose of taking measures to\r\n     suitably observe Decoration Day, took place at the City Hall\r\n     last night.\r\n\r\n     \"It was called to order by A.

Neidig was chosen secretary.\r\n\r\n     \"On motion of Mr. Collier, a committee of five was appointed\r\n     to recommend names to the meeting for the various committees\r\n     to be appointed to make preparations for that day.\r\n\r\n     \"The following persons were selected as said committee:\r\n\r\n     \"A.

It is taken from the _Daily\r\nRepublican_ of May 31, 1873:\r\n\r\n     \"Decoration Day has come and gone. It brought with it the\r\n     noble thought to honor the heroic dead of our land, and left\r\n     thousands of green graves strewn with choicest flowers of\r\n     spring. This kindly and befitting token of love and honor\r\n     was placed on every soldier's grave, to show how green and\r\n     fresh in our hearts are the memories of their noble deeds.\r\n     This day is one of mixed sorrow and pleasure--sad for the\r\n     heavy sacrifices that had to be made, but happy to keep\r\n     green the sacred memories of those who fell for their\r\n     country's good.\r\n\r\n     \"The soldiers and sailors, who have died to save the\r\n     nation's life, will never be forgotten so long as flowers\r\n     are strewn upon the quiet graves beneath whose verdant\r\n     mounds those gallant hearts lie stilled forever.\r\n\r\n     \"It is the sum of mortal glory for posterity to gather\r\n     around the tombs of fallen heroes, as around holy shrines,\r\n     and pour out their libations in songs, prayers and in\r\n     fitting words of praise on their noble lives and gallant\r\n     deeds.\r\n\r\n     \"The day opened yesterday morning with a rain storm, which\r\n     continued more or less until about ten o'clock. It looked\r\n     discouraging indeed, and many hearts felt sad at the\r\n     uninviting prospect.\r\n\r\n     \"At eleven o'clock a few persons gathered on the west side\r\n     and proceeded to the cemetery on that side of the river, and\r\n     spent a short time in decorating the graves of a few\r\n     soldiers that lie buried there. Rev. S. H. Henderson spoke a\r\n     few moments on the importance of the occasion when the\r\n     company dispersed and returned to their homes.\r\n\r\n     \"By noon the clouds had cleared away and the sun shone forth\r\n     beautifully. At half past 2 o'clock Washington street in the\r\n     vicinity of the City Hall was crowded with a large number of\r\n     people who were listening to the fine strains of music that\r\n     the Ferguson band were discoursing. About three o'clock the\r\n     procession began to move, and in pretty much the same order\r\n     as has already been published in the _Republican_. Between\r\n     seventy-five and a hundred carriages, buggies, and wagons\r\n     were in the procession, preceded by many footmen; also a\r\n     number were on horseback. It was one of the most brilliant\r\n     occasions of the kind that was ever witnessed in Cedar\r\n     Rapids.\r\n\r\n     \"We are unable to go into the particulars, as we have not\r\n     the space today to record them.\r\n\r\n     \"The number on the cemetery grounds has been estimated by\r\n     many at two thousand people, and some have raised the\r\n     estimate a thousand more. The following graves were\r\n     decorated:\r\n\r\n     \"John Harrison, Henry N. Graves and Carter Berkley, 6th Iowa\r\n     Cavalry, Co. K; Henry Fleck, 40th Ind. Inft.; John Hall,\r\n     31st Iowa; Amos Fergeson, Band, 15th Iowa Inft.; James\r\n     Morehead, Sr., Co. I, 37th Iowa Inft.; James Morehead, Jr.,\r\n     Co. K, 9th Iowa Inft.; Judson L.

After these interesting decoration\r\n     ceremonies were over, the people gathered around the stand\r\n     that had been erected for the purpose, where the following\r\n     programme was carried out:\r\n\r\n     \"Music by the Band.\r\n\r\n     \"Music by the Glee Club, 'Praise of the Soldier.'\r\n\r\n     \"Prayer by Rev.

Kendig.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"JUDGE HUBBARD'S ADDRESS\r\n\r\n     \"Judge Hubbard's address was so fine that we reproduce it\r\n     entire. He spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"My Countrymen, and Comrades of the Army of the Union:\r\n\r\n     \"Courage and bravery always challenge admiration, but when\r\n     combined with exalted patriotism, they command the affection\r\n     and gratitude of mankind.\r\n\r\n     \"The highest earthly care of man is to preserve as long as\r\n     possible this life, and therefore the greatest human\r\n     sacrifice is to give this life for one's country.\r\n\r\n     \"History is full of examples of this sacrifice in all time,\r\n     and yet its frequency has never lessened the appreciation of\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \"Patriotism--love of country, makes a great nation possible.\r\n     Without it men would live isolated, or in mere tribes, and\r\n     powerless.\r\n\r\n     \"The intellectual development of man shows him at once how\r\n     weak and insignificant he is alone, and he seeks, by a\r\n     combination of great numbers, to attain not only great power,\r\n     but even immortality. We all know that our own lives are\r\n     short, but the life of a nation may be so long, that we are\r\n     apt to make delusion that it may be immortal, real.\r\n\r\n     \"The natural love and anxiety we have for our children, who\r\n     are to live after us, extend to and embrace the country and\r\n     the government in which they are to live.\r\n\r\n     \"Hence, we may be said to have two lives, an individual and a\r\n     national one; and the latter commands the former in\r\n     proportion to its increased span. We value everything\r\n     somewhat in proportion to its power to last.\r\n\r\n     \"The study and contemplation of the national life, of which\r\n     we are a part is always a matter of interest and solicitude.\r\n\r\n     \"On every hand men are seemingly wholly engaged in devising\r\n     and planning for their individual prosperity and happiness,\r\n     and silently but surely national prosperity and greatness\r\n     follow these individual efforts. It is only when the nation\r\n     stands in immediate peril, that we become aware how much\r\n     greater our anxiety is for it, than even for ourselves.\r\n\r\n     \"You who can recall the thrill of horror, of anxiety, and of\r\n     grim determination that came over you when the news first\r\n     came that Sumter was fired upon, and the Stars and Stripes\r\n     were shot away, can tell, but I can not describe what\r\n     boundless sacrifices the national life is capable of calling\r\n     forth.\r\n\r\n     \"How quick we found what a pride and what an interest we had\r\n     in the magnitude, power, and prosperity of our country, and\r\n     how firmly we were attached to its beneficent government.\r\n\r\n     \"The history of modern civilization in Europe has shown a\r\n     constant struggle for many years for what they call the\r\n     balance of power.\r\n\r\n     \"Five leading nations, speaking five different languages, and\r\n     having different modes of thought and life, have watched and\r\n     emulated each other, and each at times has had the reputation\r\n     of being the most powerful. Fifty years ago France was\r\n     foremost, today Prussia is the first power in Europe. These\r\n     changes may be traced almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\n     \"In all the past, the national life, the national pride has\r\n     grown with the growth of civilization.\r\n\r\n     \"It would be impossible that a nation should become great or\r\n     powerful without a national self-love that wrought glowing\r\n     pictures of its manifest destiny.\r\n\r\n     \"We find ourselves possessed of a country whose productive\r\n     extent is far greater than all Europe, with its 300 million\r\n     population, put together.\r\n\r\n     \"Beginning a little less than a hundred years ago with a\r\n     population of three million, it has doubled every twenty-five\r\n     years, if we shall reach forty-eight million in 1875, which\r\n     scarcely admits of a doubt. The whole emigration added is\r\n     less than six million.\r\n\r\n     \"At the same rate of increase for the next one hundred years\r\n     our population will reach the enormous figures of seven\r\n     hundred and sixty-eight millions. But suppose we shall touch\r\n     the resistance, namely the lack of territory to supply so\r\n     great a population with food; yet we may safely estimate\r\n     reaching five hundred million, and the population equally\r\n     distributed will then be about equal in density to the\r\n     present population of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n     \"I have neither time nor is it necessary to describe the\r\n     variety of climate embracing the tropic and the temperate\r\n     zones, nor the vastness, nor the fertility, nor the mineral\r\n     and coal resources of our country.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus far nothing is problematical, but the people of future\r\n     America are a study.\r\n\r\n     \"We know how sturdy and enduring the Anglo-Saxon is, how\r\n     volatile yet tenacious is the Frenchman, how sober, solid and\r\n     unwavering is the German, and how hardy and everlasting are\r\n     the people who inhabit with the Polar bear. These are\r\n     American now, but the Ethiopian and the Asiatic are to be\r\n     added. The Star of Empire from the East and from the West\r\n     have met upon the American continent. I believe the original\r\n     Anglo-Saxon trunk will sustain all these grafts and that a\r\n     nation will come of us by the cross of all civilized people\r\n     that will be as superior to any of them, as the grafted fruit\r\n     is superior to that of the seeding. Future America will be\r\n     fitly symbolized by the Lion and the Polar Bear, surmounted\r\n     by the American Eagle.\r\n\r\n     \"With one country, one language, one hope, one aspiration,\r\n     bent sublimely upon achieving the highest intelligence,\r\n     virtue, and culture that man can ideal, diffused through a\r\n     population of five hundred million people, inhabiting\r\n     one-quarter of the habitable earth with a republican\r\n     government, is a spectacle that the world has never yet seen,\r\n     but is to see through us and our children.\r\n\r\n     \"And but for these sacred graves, which we, and all the\r\n     people throughout the land, have come today to crown with\r\n     wreaths of flowers, no such hope, no such picture of the\r\n     future of our country would be possible.\r\n\r\n     \"The future destiny of the American absolutely demanded that\r\n     the fundamental idea of the Declaration of Independence\r\n     should be made true, and that Liberty (in fact, as in name)\r\n     should be proclaimed throughout all the land to all the\r\n     inhabitants thereof, and also, that the United States should\r\n     be one and inseparable forever.\r\n\r\n     \"Need I tell you how bravely and how well the army of the\r\n     Union settled these questions?

It was not until 1887,\r\nhowever, that the germ thus planted gave fruit. On February 21, 1887,\r\nthe state of Oregon passed a law setting aside the first Saturday in\r\nJune for the observance of the cause of labor, and six years later the\r\nfirst Monday in September was chosen by the same state. That day has\r\nbeen observed ever since. The second state to legalize the holiday was\r\nNew Jersey, and in May of the following year New York passed a similar\r\nlaw, Colorado and Massachusetts soon followed. In 1890 many of the\r\nother states passed acts recognizing the day. West Virginia and North\r\nCarolina were far behind the rest in this regard and did not legalize\r\nthe day until 1899.\r\n\r\nThe first great labor demonstration was held in New York city in 1882\r\nand the parade which took place on that day is still remembered as an\r\nevent of unusual magnitude. All the labor organizations of the city\r\nwere in line and with their splendid floats, banners, etc., they made\r\nan imposing spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe following year it was determined to repeat, if possible, the parade\r\nof 1882, which had come to be termed \"The Labor Day Parade.\" This time\r\nthe date was changed to the first Monday in September and when in 1884\r\nthe discussion of a repetition of the occasion came up, George B. Floyd\r\noffered a resolution in the Central Labor Union convention to the\r\neffect that the first Monday in September be declared Labor Day. The\r\nresolution was unanimously adopted and at the next session of the\r\nlegislature a bill was introduced declaring Labor Day a legal holiday.\r\nThere was considerable objection to the measure, however, and it was\r\nnot until 1887 that a majority in its favor could be rallied together.\r\n\r\nWith the day recognized by the legislature of New York and two other\r\nstates a concerted effort was made to secure action by the various\r\nlabor organizations throughout the country, and in a few years the\r\nmajority of the states had declared in its favor.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the original Labor Day was just after the organization\r\nof the first local in this city, which the \"old residents\" say is\r\nTypographical Union No. 192. There may be some objection to this claim\r\non the part of some of the present members of the typographical union.\r\nThe charter of the Typographical Union local is now hanging in the K.\r\nP. hall, and it is dated December 26, 1881. Unless challenged the\r\nmembers of the Typographical Union will claim the honor of being the\r\nfirst organization of union labor in the city of Cedar Rapids. The\r\ncharter bears the names of the following charter members:\r\n\r\nC. M. Hopkins, George S. Bradley, Harry Ingalls, J. D. Canan, L. C.\r\nHay, L. B. Kramer, J. H. Enos.\r\n\r\nIf the memory of Sam Snouffer is correct the local was organized among\r\nthe employees of the _Republican_ office and it was a local of\r\nnewspaper printers only. Sam says that he was a job printer at the time\r\nand the boys on the cases who organized the local didn't at first allow\r\njob printers to hold membership in their organizations. He says that\r\nthe local was organized for a fight and it had it at frequent intervals\r\nduring the early part of its history. But it grew and flourished and\r\ntoday the Typographical Union Local in Cedar Rapids is recognized as a\r\nconservative, yet aggressive body of men, with the courage to ask for\r\nits rights and the level headedness to get those rights without\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A MOUNTAIN HOWITZER\r\n\r\nDuring the war when the boys were about to return home they sought to\r\ncarry back mementoes of the long struggle. Company E of the Twelfth\r\nIowa as a trophy of the war picked up a mountain howitzer which had\r\nbeen captured by the rebels and re-captured by the United States\r\ntroops. Some members of Company D of the Twelfth Iowa then, by some\r\nmeans known only to the soldier boys, unlawfully laid claim to the\r\ncannon and Homer Morehead, one of the old Cedar Rapids boys, was able\r\nto get the cannon as far as Davenport, the city council of Cedar Rapids\r\nproviding means to get it to Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe cannon, a two hundred pounder, was used freely by every\r\norganization for a number of years whenever any celebration took place.\r\nDuring the Grant campaign, in October of that year, the republicans had\r\na blow-out and the cannon was used; in this celebration the cannon was\r\nslightly damaged and was hauled down to John Mehan's for repairs. While\r\nthere some person, or persons, saw fit to take it in the night time and\r\nnothing was heard of it for many years. A note was tacked up to the\r\nwall where the cannon had been left for repairs to the effect that it\r\nwould be returned and shot off when a democratic president was\r\ninaugurated. The soldier boys and many of the prominent citizens of\r\nCedar Rapids were very much stirred up over this affair and publicly\r\naccused a number of prominent Cedar Rapids democratic citizens of\r\nstealing the cannon, but no one, at least who was publicly accused,\r\nadmitted having anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe incident was nearly forgotten when Cleveland was elected, the first\r\ndemocratic president since the Civil war. One morning as Harry Brown\r\nwas walking down the street John Mehan called to him to come over and\r\nsee what he had found. There, sure enough, was the same old mountain\r\nhowitzer cleaned up and in first class repair, with a note tied to it\r\nthat it was returned as agreed and would be ready for action in due\r\ntime. This affair stirred up the republican camp once more and threats\r\nwere made that this cannon would never be shot off to celebrate a\r\ndemocratic victory, and it never was.\r\n\r\nIt now remains as a relic in the old postoffice building, and many are\r\nthe citizens of Linn county who have inspected this little cannon and\r\nhave heard the story told by the old settlers.\r\n\r\nNot until a short time ago was it definitely known who removed the\r\ncannon from the Mehan shop in 1868. A Center Point person had been\r\naccused of having something to do with it; how true this is no one\r\nknows. It is thought that two young men in the employ of N. B. Brown, a\r\nstanch democrat, took the cannon and placed it in the stable owned by\r\nO. P. Emery which stood on the ground where the Denecke building now\r\nstands. Mr. Emery no doubt knew of the whereabouts of the cannon, and\r\nwhen he removed up on Second avenue a heavy box was moved by workmen\r\nsupposed to contain tools. When Mr. Emery removed to the home of his\r\nson-in-law, John B. Henderson, on First avenue, the same heavy box was\r\nonce more moved. Mrs. John B. Henderson noticed that her father, after\r\nthe election of Cleveland, spent several days in the barn working\r\nsteadily polishing up some iron, but she never inquired what he was\r\ndoing or what he wanted to accomplish. A short time before his death\r\nO. P. Emery admitted to his daughter that while he did not remove the\r\ncannon he knew of its whereabouts and had some of his intimate friends\r\nrestore it to the Mehan shop after Cleveland's election as it had been\r\nagreed in the letter or note left the night of the capture of the\r\ncannon when no one was around to watch this much prized treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FORTUNATE TUMBLE\r\n\r\nLinn county during the Civil war had its share of so-called\r\n\"copperheads,\" as well as a goodly number of loyal sympathizers known\r\nas \"fire eaters.\" During this period of our country's history many\r\nunfortunate affairs occurred of which all parties ever afterwards were\r\nashamed. In a state where the majority was strong in favor of the war\r\nmeasure it behooved those who were against this measure not to say too\r\nmuch. Frequently innocent people had to suffer for the acts of some one\r\nwho talked openly and above board, not only against the president but\r\nagainst those who were instrumental in sending troops to the front.\r\nDemocrats in the north were classed by the republicans as follows:\r\nThose who went to the front as loyal democrats, and those who stayed at\r\nhome as \"copperheads,\" although they may have been otherwise\r\nlaw-abiding citizens.\r\n\r\nOn the morning that news was received of the assassination of Lincoln\r\nCedar Rapids became a town of turmoil and strife. Never in the history\r\nof the town had excitement run so high. The question of another war was\r\ndiscussed in saloons and on street corners, and during the entire day\r\nthis strife was kept up. Towards evening a story got started that Bill\r\nHarper, a well-known anti-war democrat and a person who had frequently\r\nwhen intoxicated said some pretty mean things of the republicans in\r\ngeneral, said \"that he was glad that Lincoln got killed; that he should\r\nhave been shot four years ago.\" The story spread like a western wild\r\nfire, and in less than an hour it was all over town. A crowd got\r\ntogether and it was not long till a self-appointed committee was\r\norganized for the sole purpose of hanging Bill Harper to a rafter or a\r\nsour apple tree at sight and without trial. A good sized rope was\r\nprocured and the yelling crowd, headed by the late I. N. Whittam and\r\nothers, made for the store room kept by Brown & Harper, on what is now\r\nNorth First street. That Harper was a well-known and outspoken\r\nso-called \"copperhead\" was universally known and no question arose in\r\nthe minds of the mob as to the truth or falsity of the charge. A few in\r\nthe party uttered remarks that there might be a mistake and that there\r\nought to be some investigation to bear out the facts before the rope\r\nwas applied, but the majority ruled and these faint-hearted fellows\r\nwere laughed to scorn. N. B. Brown, who had heard of the trouble and\r\nwho was a partner of Harper, got into the store building, mounted a\r\nbarrel and talked to the crowd, claiming that Harper could not have\r\nsaid the words with which he was charged, for he had not been in town\r\nfor several days. Squire Knowles, a republican and a believer in fair\r\nplay, tried to persuade the mob to disperse, but his plea found little\r\nfavor with a mob who insisted on a hanging. Then Bill Darr, a neighbor\r\nof Harper, also a republican, had to come to the front and tell what he\r\nknew about Harper. He said that Harper had been at home near Bertram\r\nand had been sick in bed for several days, and that he had been to his\r\nhouse and called on him the day before and he was certain that Harper\r\nknew nothing of what had taken place at the national capital. Darr was\r\nnot treated any better than the others and was called \"traitor\" and all\r\nsorts of names because he wanted to save his neighbor's life if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. BOWMAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. M. CROW]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. M. MAY]\r\n\r\nMany of the crowd had been drinking heavily and insisted that something\r\nbe done, and if they could not do any better they ought to fire the\r\nbuilding and burn up the whole thing, while Brown insisted that most of\r\nthe property was his and that he would vouch for his partner's honor\r\nand reputation as far as that charge went. Whittam by this time had\r\ngotten over the blood curdling period of his leadership and was willing\r\nto turn the job over to other hands, but no one seemed willing to come\r\nto his rescue, and there was no opportunity to put a motion for an\r\nadjournment till the violence and the temper of the mob would somewhat\r\nabate. Brown wanted to hold the mob as long as possible, having in the\r\nmeantime sent messengers to notify Harper of what might happen. He\r\nrealized that the infuriated mob at that stage of the game might hang\r\nan innocent man.\r\n\r\nJust at this point of the delicate proceedings, the crowd yelling like\r\nwarlike Indians, and threatening to hang any \"copperhead\" and to burn\r\nthe building provided Harper was not brought into the room, a fourteen\r\nyear old boy, long, lank and lean, who had also crowded into the\r\nbuilding wanting to see what was going on, and to get more air, climbed\r\non top of a hogshead which stood in one corner of the room. As he was\r\ngazing out over the crowd others tried to get on to the same hogshead,\r\npushing and pulling, when suddenly the end gave way and the boy fell\r\ninto a mass of lard and dye stuff up to his neck. The stench acted like\r\nmorphine upon the infuriated mob. Someone called for the rope to pull\r\nthe boy out and then a general laugh broke out and when the boy ran\r\ndown through the crowd, dripping with lard and lye, making for the\r\nriver, the panic became general and they all followed his movements and\r\nforgot all about Bill Harper or the words he was supposed to have\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\nThe boy who thus saved the day and perhaps a life or two is no other\r\nthan O. C. Carpenter, for many years one of the best known constables\r\nin Rapids township. Carpenter still insists that he saved the day,\r\nalthough the ordeal he had to pass through was somewhat harsh. The lye\r\nburned his legs and spoiled a suit of clothes, and he got a good\r\nthrashing at home, in the bargain. The Greek boy of old fell on his\r\nsword, but the modern Linn county boy fell into a soap barrel and by\r\nthat side-stepping cast honors on himself and on members of his family\r\nfor all time to come.\r\n\r\nBill Harper never uttered the words of which he was accused, and never\r\nknew that Lincoln had been assassinated until the evening of the day\r\nwhen the infuriated mob was hunting him with a rope, wishing to put an\r\nend to his earthly existence. This shows how dangerous it is to stir up\r\nthe mob spirit at any time. It always leads to disgraceful acts, from\r\nwhich a community suffers for a long time afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE'S AN INTERESTING BIT OF ANCIENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn running through the files of the early years of the Cedar Rapids\r\nDaily _Republican_, the following interesting historical contribution,\r\nfrom the pen of the late Sampson C. Bever, was found:\r\n\r\n     \"Editor Cedar Rapids _Republican_:\r\n\r\n     \"I notice in the last 'Daily Republican,' in referring to the\r\n     City National Bank of this city, in connection with the death\r\n     of the Hon. Oakes Ames, the following:\r\n\r\n     \"'The death of Mr. Ames recalls to mind the successful aid\r\n     given S. C. Bever, Esq., in getting the charter of the City\r\n     National Bank. The First National had already been\r\n     established and as Cedar Rapids had a population of only\r\n     2,000 people at the time the comptroller of currency declined\r\n     to establish another bank here, but by the assistance of Mr.\r\n     Ames the charter was finally obtained.'\r\n\r\n     \"The facts in the case are these: The City National Bank\r\n     received its certificate of authority and had commenced\r\n     successful business some time before the application for\r\n     charter or certificate of the First National Bank was\r\n     granted.\r\n\r\n     \"It is true an application for a City National Bank, with a\r\n     capital of $50,000, was first made, and it was provided by\r\n     the law of congress, creating National banks, that no\r\n     charter for less than $100,000 should be granted, unless it\r\n     should receive the approval of the Secretary of the\r\n     Treasury. Mr. Ames being in Washington at the time this\r\n     application was made, and being a warm friend of mine, he\r\n     kindly offered to give me his influence, and wrote a strong\r\n     letter to Mr. Chase, then Secretary of the Treasury, urging\r\n     him to sanction my application for $50,000, but before\r\n     presenting this letter I was urged by Mr. McCullough, then\r\n     comptroller of the currency, that as there was no other\r\n     national bank organized in Cedar Rapids, and the population\r\n     was about 4,000, I should by all means make my application\r\n     for $100,000, to which I finally agreed. And as greenbacks\r\n     and government bonds were at my command, I had no further\r\n     need for 'successful aid' from anyone, being well known to\r\n     Mr. McCullough, the comptroller of the currency. But I none\r\n     the less highly appreciated the kindness tendered me by my\r\n     friend Mr. Ames.\r\n\r\n     \"I make this explanation, not so much on my own account, as\r\n     that of others, who so well understand all the\r\n     circumstances.\r\n\r\n                                               \"S. C. BEVER.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Republican_ of that date, May 12, 1873, also printed the following\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n     \"The statement that was made in the columns of the\r\n     _Republican_ on Saturday, concerning Oakes Ames and the City\r\n     National Bank, is one of those unfortunate kind of errors\r\n     that often creep into a daily newspaper. The statement, as\r\n     it appeared in print, was precisely as it was handed us by\r\n     one of our prominent citizens, and we took it for granted,\r\n     of course, that it was correct. Since Mr. Bever's\r\n     communication has been handed us, we have made a personal\r\n     examination into the matter, and have discovered an\r\n     important fact which, it is due the City National Bank,\r\n     should be published. We find in the report of the\r\n     comptroller of the currency, that the City National Bank\r\n     stands upon record as number 483, and the First National\r\n     Bank as 500, which goes to show that the former was\r\n     organized some time before the latter. Of course neither\r\n     bank has any interest in this matter further than to be\r\n     placed before the public correctly, and we have it to regret\r\n     that the statement appeared in our columns on Saturday in\r\n     the form in which it did.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n_Beginnings of Churches and the Fraternities in Cedar Rapids_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following accurate account of the beginnings of the churches and\r\nthe fraternities in the city of Cedar Rapids, written by the late James\r\nL. Enos in the early '60s, will have a double interest. It not only\r\ngives the story of the beginnings of the various institutions, but also\r\ncomments upon their condition and prospects at the time the article was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nMethodist Episcopal--This society was organized in 1844, by Rev. Isaac\r\nSearles with nine members. As early as 1841 meetings were held by a\r\nRev. Hodges, but no society was organized. In 1845 the Rev. Alexander\r\nBushnell organized the first Methodist Sabbath school. Hodges, Searles\r\nand Bushnell were the first three Methodist ministers who preached in\r\nCedar Rapids. Rev. Elias Skinner [still living at Waterloo] was the\r\nfirst pastor who permanently or wholly occupied his time with the\r\nchurch. During his appointment here the church was in a prosperous\r\ncondition. Since that time, from a variety of causes, the interest of\r\nthe church has fallen off and its former popularity seems to have\r\ndeparted. The present number of members is 90; number attending the\r\nSabbath schools on both sides of the river, about 130. Rev. Mr. Miller\r\nis the present pastor. The church edifice was erected in 1854.\r\n\r\nFirst Presbyterian--This society was organized July 9, 1847, with seven\r\nmembers, of whom Mrs. Mary Ely is the only surviving member. Bennet\r\nRogers preached here and at Marion on alternate Sabbaths for a time.\r\nRev. Williston Jones was the first regular pastor. He continued his\r\nlabors with this society until July, 1856, when he removed to Iowa\r\nFalls. Rev. L. F. Dudley was the second pastor and J. W. Atherton\r\nfollowed in 1859. James Knox is the present pastor. I have not been\r\nable to learn the present number of members attending the Sabbath\r\nschool. The church edifice was erected in 1850 and was the first of the\r\nkind in the city.\r\n\r\nUnited Presbyterian (Seceders)--This church is located on the west side\r\nof the river; it was organized in 1851 with eight members. Rev. J. B.\r\nForsythe was the first pastor, Rev. H. Sturgeon the second, and Rev. J.\r\nL. Fulton the third and present pastor. The church now numbers fifty\r\nmembers and is in a flourishing condition. Sixty pupils attend the\r\nSabbath school. The church edifice is a plain brick, erected in 1859.\r\n\r\nSecond Presbyterian (Old School)--This society was organized May 27,\r\n1855, with twenty members. Rev. R. H. Morrow, a most exemplary and\r\nworthy man, was the pastor. By his admirable qualities he won the\r\nregard of all with whom he came in contact. D. H. Mitchell was the\r\nsecond pastor. Following the expiration of his labors the pulpit was\r\ntemporarily occupied by I. N. Reed, a thoroughly Old School divine. J.\r\nB. McBridge came next, and S. W. Miller is present pastor. The church\r\nnow numbers some sixty members, and the Sabbath school has 80 to 120\r\nenrolled. The church edifice is a neat but unpretending structure on\r\nthe east side of Adams street, between Market and Sugar streets. It has\r\na bell weighing 800 pounds and is furnished with a cottage organ. The\r\npastor's salary is $1,000 a year, and the church is free from debt.\r\n\r\nCatholic--This church commenced holding meetings in Cedar Rapids in\r\n1853. Rev. Fr. Hannah officiated here at monthly intervals until 1857,\r\nin which year the church was formally organized. Mass was celebrated by\r\nRev. Fr. Emmons this same year in the home of Alexander Hager. When\r\nfirst services were held, 1853, there were but three adherents to the\r\nfaith in town. The church edifice, 24×50 feet, located at the south\r\ncorner of Jackson and Market streets, was erected in 1857-8. Rev.\r\nEmmons served three years and was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Gillespie, and\r\nhe by Rev. Uhlenbrock. The fifth and present priest of this parish is\r\nRev. Fr. Cannon. The congregation now has about 300 members, most of\r\nwhom live in the surrounding country. Last year (1863) a mission was\r\nconducted by Rev. Father Weniger.\r\n\r\nEpiscopal--The organization of this church took place in 1851, with but\r\nten members. James Keeler was the first rector, then followed Revs. C.\r\nC. Townsend, Samuel Goodale, Samuel Starr, William Fulton and C. S.\r\nPercival, the present pastor. The corner stone of this church was laid\r\nby Bishop Kemper in 1851, and was consecrated in 1856. It now has about\r\n80 members and the Sabbath school over 100 attendants. The church\r\nbuilding is situated on the south side of Linn street, between Madison\r\nand Monroe streets. The exterior is not yet completed according to\r\noriginal designs.\r\n\r\nBaptist--The present church was organized by Rev. W. Eberhart, the\r\nfirst settled pastor, June 3, 1860, with a membership of twenty-eight.\r\nHe continued in charge until November, 1861, resigning to take\r\nchaplaincy in the Twelfth Iowa Infantry Volunteers. Rev. N. F. Ravlin\r\nfollowed and remained with the church until April of this year (1864).\r\nThe society is at present without a pastor. The congregation now\r\nnumbers nearly 140 and the Sabbath school has about 100 attendants. The\r\nsociety has no church edifice but has purchased a lot on Eagle street\r\nand will build soon.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these there are scattering members of other religious\r\ndenominations, among which are Universalists, Christians, Lutherans,\r\nNew Jerusalem adherents, Spiritualists, and perhaps some others are\r\nrepresented. None of the church edifices are of the first class. In\r\nfact each society is too feeble to erect a church creditable to the\r\ncity. We might hope for a more perfect Christian union and with that\r\nwould come the ability to sustain a sufficient number of churches,\r\nwithout the necessity of appealing for foreign aid to enable them to\r\ndrag along an existence of doubtful value.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF LODGES\r\n\r\nMasonic--The Masonic lodge was instituted in November, 1850, by a\r\nwarrant of dispensation from Grand Master McCord, and its charter was\r\nissued June 4, 1851, being the twenty-fifth lodge of that fraternity\r\norganized in Iowa. George Greene was the first Worshipful Master; John\r\nVardy, Senior Warden; Isaac Cook, Junior Warden; Thomas Downing,\r\nTreasurer; N. B. Brown, Secretary; Stephen L. Pollock, Senior Deacon;\r\nJ. H. Kelsey, Junior Deacon, and Samuel Hook, Tyler. Seymour D.\r\nCarpenter was the first person made a Mason in this lodge. The\r\nfollowing have been Masters to this date: James Keeler, Thomas Downing,\r\nJohn Vardy, Hiram Deem, S. L. Pollock, Jacob H. Camburn, and James L.\r\nEnos. James C. Adams is the present Master. The lodge numbers about 75\r\nmembers and has the reputation of being one of the best working bodies\r\nof Masonry in the state. It was first organized as Cedar Rapids lodge,\r\nbut has changed its name, being now known as Crescent lodge No. 25.\r\n\r\nOdd Fellows--A lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows was\r\ninstituted December 28, 1850, about a month after the Masonic lodge was\r\norganized. It was known as Hope lodge No. 30. It continued its\r\nexistence until some time during 1860, when it became defunct. The\r\noriginal charter members were George Greene, John F. Ely, Absalom\r\nSines, Joseph Greene and John H. Kelsey. Those who have been honored\r\nwith election to office of Noble Grand in this lodge are: George\r\nGreene, Absalom Sines, John P. Ely, W. W. Smith, Joseph Greene, F. A.\r\nWilmans, L. H. Keyes, Homer Bishop, D. M. McIntosh, Hiram Deem, Charles\r\nWeare, Samuel Milligan, George Livensbarger and C. Fordyce. At one time\r\nthe lodge was in a flourishing condition, but through some unfortunate\r\ncircumstances it declined, and finally surrendered its charter.\r\n\r\nVarious minor orders (Good Templars, Sons of Temperance, etc.) have had\r\na temporary existence in the city from time to time, but none of these\r\nnow have a local being.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATER SKETCH OF THE CEDAR RAPIDS CHURCHES\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from an address on Church Day delivered by\r\nRev. C. W. Maggart, D. D., during the semi-centennial celebration in\r\nCedar Rapids, June, 1906:\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the first church organization was the St. Paul's\r\nMethodist Episcopal. The Rev. John Hodges preached here as early as\r\n1840, but it was not until 1841 that the \"class\" was organized with\r\ntwelve people, one of whom, Mrs. John Listebarger, is yet living and\r\nwith us today.\r\n\r\nThis church was organized in the log cabin of Mr. and Mrs. J.\r\nListebarger on the west side of the river near the west end of the B\r\navenue bridge. Service was later continued in the first building in\r\ntown, in which lived Thomas Sharp. At the time of the incorporation of\r\nCedar Rapids this church had 148 members and their own little brick\r\nchurch, built in 1854, and located where the union station now stands.\r\nThis church has had thirty-six pastors. Its present church was built in\r\n1873 and is valued at $30,000.00. The number of members is 669.\r\n\r\nThe second church organized was the First Presbyterian, on July 12,\r\n1847, with nine members, with the Rev. Williston Jones as the first\r\nregular pastor.\r\n\r\nThe first church building to be erected in the town was the \"Little\r\nMuddy\" church, which was on the postoffice site, 26×40 feet, and cost\r\n$1,200.00. It was dedicated January 12, 1851.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago this church had sixty-seven members. Prior to the\r\norganization of this church a union Sunday school was held in the first\r\nframe building in the town, in the cabinet shop of John Vardy. This\r\nchurch has had five pastors, was built in 1869, and has property valued\r\nat $70,000. It has 477 members.\r\n\r\nThe Grace Episcopal church was the third church organized in the town.\r\nThe organization took place in the school house in the summer of 1850.\r\nThe first rector was the Rev. James Keeler. These services were later\r\nheld in Tisdale's carriage factory. The upper floor was sometimes used\r\nfor grain storage, and as it would drop through the cracks it would\r\nattract the attention of the porkers, which would frequently disturb\r\nthe meetings with responses not found in the litany. At other times the\r\nupper story was inhabited and frequently the service would be carried\r\non to the music of the nurse and cradle above. A great interest was\r\ntaken in this church when Mr. S. C. Bever and family arrived from the\r\neast with a 750-pound bell. But a still greater interest was manifested\r\nwhen Judge Greene presented the church with a melodeon. In 1856 this\r\nchurch had thirty-six members. Today it has 505 members, has property\r\nvalued at $100,000.00, and has been served by thirteen rectors.\r\n\r\nThe fourth church organized was the United Presbyterian, on April 19,\r\n1851, with eleven members; and the first pastor was the Rev. Hugh\r\nSturgeon. This is the oldest church now in existence on the west side\r\nof the river. Fifty years ago they had about fifty members. Today they\r\nhave 225 members, property valued at $20,000.00 and have been served by\r\nsix pastors.\r\n\r\nThe fifth church was the Second Presbyterian, now Westminster, which\r\nwas known as the old school Presbyterian church and was organized May\r\n27, 1855, with twenty members. Its first minister was the Rev. R. H.\r\nMorrow. Their first building was located on the east side of Adams\r\nstreet, between Market and Sugar, and the principal thing mentioned by\r\nformer church historians was that they had a bell weighing 800 pounds\r\nand their music was led by a cottage organ. Fifty years ago they\r\nreported fifty members. They report today 500 members, with a property\r\nvalued at $60,000.00, and have been served by twelve pastors. Their\r\npresent church was built in 1905.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the First U. B. church was organized in 1855 in the Dairy\r\nDale district, which was probably then in the country. Rev. McWilliams\r\nwas the pastor. They had thirty-five members at the time the city was\r\nincorporated. This church, however, later, went down for some years and\r\nwas afterwards reorganized. They have today 260 members, church\r\nproperty valued at $25,000.00 and have been served by fifteen pastors.\r\nTheir present church was erected in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe Baptist and Congregational denominations had organizations on the\r\nwest side prior to 1856 but both were too weak to live.\r\n\r\nDuring the first decade of the city's history two more churches were\r\nstarted, viz., the Roman Catholic and First Baptist. Fathers Hanna and\r\nEmmons of Iowa City held services for some time before organization and\r\nthey only had three adherents. This shows pluck and faith and devotion\r\nto their own church. The church was organized in 1857 and Father\r\nGillespie was the first regular pastor. This church has had five\r\npastors. Their present church was built in 1870 and is valued at\r\n$40,000.00. They report 1,500 members.\r\n\r\nThe First Baptist church was organized in Franklin hall, above\r\nKilborn's gallery, on June 3, 1860, with twenty-seven members. Rev. A.\r\nG. Eberhart was the first pastor. They purchased a lot on Eagle street,\r\nwhere their first church was built. Their present church was built in\r\n1894 and is valued at $50,000.00. They have had fifteen pastors and\r\nhave now 365 members.\r\n\r\nThe next decade four or five organizations came into existence. The\r\nfirst Lutheran services were held in the winter of 1855-56 and an\r\norganization was formally effected in the First Presbyterian church, on\r\nMarch 3, 1856, with about twenty-two members, under Rev. H. F. Ealy,\r\nminister, who walked from Iowa City to preach to the scattered\r\nLutherans. Services were irregularly held by Revs. H. F. Ealy, Solomon\r\nRitz, of Tipton, and J. G. Schaffer, of Lisbon, until 1868, when the\r\norganization was re-formed in the home of J. A. Hart, 211 Fifth avenue,\r\nwith thirty members under the Rev. Cephas Baird as regular pastor.\r\n\r\nThe first church was built on the lot now occupied by the Cedar Rapids\r\nSavings bank, Third avenue and Third street, but this congregation\r\nrefused to permanently locate there on such an expensive lot, which was\r\nthen worth $300.00. This church has now 368 members and has been served\r\nby eight pastors. The present church was erected in 1881 and is valued\r\nat $20,000.00. A new church costing $35,000.00 is now in course of\r\nerection on the corner of Third avenue and Tenth street. It will be\r\noccupied early in 1911.\r\n\r\nThe Universalist society was organized in 1869 and the first pastor was\r\nthe Rev. W. C. Brooks. For nearly seven years their services were held\r\nin a hall. Their present church was built in 1875 and has been served\r\nby eight pastors. They have approximately 100 members and property\r\nvalued at $16,000.00.\r\n\r\nThe Bethel African Methodist Episcopal church was organized in 1870,\r\nand the first pastor was the Rev. J. W. Lewis. They have had sixteen\r\npastors and have now seventy-nine members. Their church was built in\r\n1874 and is valued at $5,000.00.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 St. Wenceslaus church was organized and its first pastor was\r\nthe Rev. Francis Chmelar. They began with a church family of sixty.\r\nThey have now 1,200 members, a church property erected in 1904 valued\r\nat $50,000.00, and have been served by five pastors.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1874, the Second United Presbyterian church was organized\r\nwith the Rev. W. J. McCallister as minister. It continued in existence\r\nfor about twenty-four years and its property is being used today by\r\nSunshine Mission.\r\n\r\nThe First Christian church was organized August 1, 1875, with\r\nthirty-four charter members. Its first pastor was the Rev. N. A.\r\nMcConnell. Since the organization there have been eight pastors. The\r\npresent church was built in 1882 and its value is placed at $15,000.00,\r\nalthough the original cost was $22,000.00. They have a membership of\r\n350.\r\n\r\nThe Second United Brethren church was organized in January, 1876, under\r\nthe Rev. Father Bookwalter, and did good work for a number of years,\r\nbut has ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe German Evangelical church was organized April 30, 1877, and its\r\nfirst pastor was the Rev. C. C. Pfund. They have had twelve pastors and\r\nhave now sixty members. Their church was built in 1888 and they have\r\nproperty valued at $12,000.00.\r\n\r\nThe Free Methodist church was organized in 1877 and they have had\r\neighteen pastors. The first pastor was Rev. W. C. Thompson. Their\r\nchurch was built in 1878, is valued at $4,000.00, and they have\r\nforty-seven members.\r\n\r\nThe First Congregational church was organized on May 13, 1879, and its\r\nfirst pastor was the Rev. A. T. Reed. They have had seven pastors and\r\nhave now 350 members. Their present church was built in 1889 and their\r\nproperty valuation is placed at $35,000.00.\r\n\r\nThe Zion Evangelical church came into being February, 1880, through the\r\nwork of Rev. Ilion. The Rev. J. E. Stauffacher was the first regular\r\npastor. They have had nine pastors and have now 175 members. Their\r\nchurch was built in 1905 and is valued at $23,000.00.\r\n\r\nThe German Lutheran church was organized August 24, 1884, with twenty\r\ncharter members. Revs. Studt from Luzerne and Aron from Atkins, Iowa,\r\npreached for nearly one year on alternate Sundays when the Rev. J.\r\nDenckmann, its present pastor, became the first regular pastor. They\r\nhave a membership of 350 and a church property valued at $10,000.00.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish Lutheran church was organized November 8, 1885, and its\r\nfirst pastor was the Rev. C. E. Cesander.

P. J. FLYNN\r\n\r\n\r\nAll honor to those pioneer clerics and laity for the work they\r\naccomplished under trying and difficult circumstances. In the pioneer\r\ndays no musical sound of silvery bell, from lofty steeple or tall\r\nminaret called them on the Sabbath morn, no swelling peal of organ or\r\ntrained choir entertained or invited the worshipers in those early\r\ndays, there were no Godly ministers to bury the old and instruct the\r\nyoung, no books, or papers to read and to gather wisdom from their\r\npages, to strengthen the weak and enlighten the dull. No need to be\r\nscandalized if in some instances, we find men grow weak under such\r\ntrying circumstances. No wonder that pioneer conditions among miners\r\nand others, were such as to indicate little fear of God or little\r\nregard for men. Little do we know, in this age of ease and facility, of\r\nthe difficulties and dangers, offered in those days to priest and\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe effort of the writer of the following pages will be to chronicle\r\nfacts, well established and authentic, relative to the church in Linn\r\ncounty, rather than to draw on imagination or to give color to his\r\nassertions from a rhetorical viewpoint. It is the scope of history to\r\nchronicle events relating to the past, for present and future use.\r\nThere is no assertion made in these pages that has not been\r\ninvestigated and truthfully established, in most cases by those who\r\nwere eye and ear witnesses to the events referred to.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how difficult it is to obtain correct\r\ninformation about the early days in a new country it is both\r\neducational and interesting to engage in such research. One would not\r\nimagine that information concerning things and conditions of less than\r\nfifty years ago would be so difficult to obtain. Yet the fact remains,\r\nand this fact is in itself a strong argument in favor of works like the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly credible that the early settlers could accomplish what\r\nthey did under circumstances as they were in those days. What strength\r\nof character and determination of purpose these early settlers showed\r\nin the face of difficulty and danger is truly admirable. What noble\r\nideals they had, and how earnestly and well they strove for their\r\nattainment. The present prosperity is due in no small degree to their\r\nuntiring efforts in laying the foundation of present advantages.\r\nPosterity may well hold their names in benediction, and the heart may\r\nwith pride and reverence swell with admiration for the hardy pioneer\r\nwhose heritage is now enjoyed. The present moral standards of the\r\npeople, the numerous schools and churches and the general intelligence\r\nhave been builded on the foundations laid by our ancestors and are\r\nmonuments and tributes to their character, influence and enthusiasm.\r\nWhen Linn county was but a mission district from Iowa City, meetings\r\nwere held whenever and wherever the priest found it convenient for the\r\nbest results or for the convenience of the greatest number of souls.\r\nSometimes service was held in a log cabin, sometimes in a district\r\nschool house. When the missionary contemplated a visit his intention\r\nwas announced through the district; the date and place of meeting were\r\nmade known and thither the scattered settlers gathered on foot or on\r\nhorseback or in wagons. They were happy in their inconvenience at being\r\nallowed even in such circumstances to make their peace with God and\r\nreceive the consolations of religion.\r\n\r\nSuch were the conditions in Linn county half a century since. How\r\nlittle we realize the advantages we enjoy in this day.\r\n\r\nFew and far between, however, were the visits of the shepherd to the\r\nscattered hamlets of the early settlers. Missionary men went about,\r\npreaching and teaching and their lives were an example to all with whom\r\nthey came in contact. Of such men and their life work, we have now to\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\nThe first record we have of the interests of Linn county in things\r\nCatholic was in 1853, when Father Emmons of Iowa City with apostolic\r\nspirit and Christlike zeal journeyed through the trackless wastes to\r\ncater to the needs of the children of the faith.\r\n\r\nIn those days, fifty-seven years ago, it is needless to say Cedar\r\nRapids was not known as the Parlor City. Its pretensions were very\r\nmodest. It consisted of only a few small residences with a few stores\r\nto supply the needs of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH IN CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nThe chief business industries in those days were the lumber mills of\r\nMr. J. J. Snouffer, Sr. The wild and trackless wastes were being\r\ngradually cleared, and the logs were being fitted for the formation of\r\nrough log cabins to shelter man and beast. Rough fords or bridges were\r\nthrown across the irregular and meandering streams which flowed in\r\nundisturbed tranquillity on their way towards the Father of Waters. It\r\nwas nothing unusual frequently to find that the temporary bridges were\r\ncarried away over night and the log dweller found himself in the\r\nmorning isolated and compelled patiently to wait the subsiding of the\r\nwaters to furnish himself with the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nIn these days the missionary priest passed along giving his blessing to\r\nthe work as he went, and in log cabins or improvised chapels fed the\r\nbread of life to the hungering sheep of the fold.\r\n\r\nThe first record there is, and that in the memory of those who were\r\npresent, of mass being offered in Cedar Rapids was in 1853, when Father\r\nEmmons of Iowa City, celebrated the holy sacrifice for the first time\r\nin the old Dubuque House in B avenue between Fourth and Fifth streets.\r\nIt is a regrettable fact that the location has since been turned to\r\nuses less holy. During his visits afterwards from his home town to\r\nCedar Rapids he always stayed, and officiated at the Snouffer home on\r\nSecond street, which in those days occupied the site on which now\r\nstands the Denecke store.\r\n\r\nIn those days the Catholic settlers came for miles around to Cedar\r\nRapids, and assisted at divine service whenever the goodly priest found\r\nit possible to come among them. In wagons drawn by oxen they wended\r\ntheir way from the western part of the county, from Fairfax, and along\r\nto the Benton county border line, and even beyond. Often their journey\r\nmeant days of delay owing to impassable ways and washed out bridges.\r\nAll honor to those pioneer Catholics who so prized their religion and\r\ntheir faith. No wonder that seed sown under such trying circumstances\r\nbrought forth fruit which abides. Among the early settlers who gave\r\nsuch proof of their worth and dared difficulties for their religious\r\nopinions we find the names of Murray, Keenan, Cook, Hayden, Lilly,\r\nKehoe, Meehan, Flaherty, Cahill, Langan, Christopher, Villeen,\r\nHarrington, Hager, and others.\r\n\r\nAnother pioneer of those days was Father Smith who occasionally visited\r\nthe itinerary of Father Emmons when the latter was unable to do so. Fr.\r\nHarmon, also of Iowa City, came a few times into this territory and\r\nassisted in sowing the seed and nurturing it in its tender years.\r\n\r\nAfter Fr. Harmon's departure the duty again rested upon the shoulders\r\nof Father Emmons until Father Gillespie was sent by Bishop Smith to\r\nform a new parish in Cedar Rapids, along in the early sixties.\r\n\r\nThe first effort that was made to establish a church in Cedar Rapids\r\nwas when a piece of property was secured on Sixth avenue and Sixth\r\nstreet, near the present residence of Dr. Skinner. Those who were\r\nleaders in this laudable undertaking were J. J. Snouffer, Sr.,\r\nAlexander Hager, and Francis Lilly. Objection was made to the selection\r\nof the site on Sixth avenue and Sixth street from more sources than one\r\nand attention was next directed towards the present site on Third\r\navenue and Seventh street. Through the efforts of the above mentioned\r\nmen three lots were secured, and operations were begun and a little\r\nchurch constructed large enough for the needs of the time. The lumber\r\nwas obtained at Snouffer's mill, the workmanship was contracted for by\r\nAlex. Hager, who was a carpenter, and the means were supplied by Mr.\r\nLilly, Mr. Thos. Murray, Andrew Stark, John Meehan, Flaherty, and\r\nothers. After Father Gillespie came Father Enlinbrook, who retained the\r\ncharge only a short time. After his departure Fr. Shields came\r\noccasionally in missionary work.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Fr. Cannon assumed charge and remained about two years.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1867 Father P. V. McLoughlin came and remained about six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nOne would naturally expect that by this time the congregation should\r\nhave grown considerably, but the fact is that on the first Sunday of\r\nOctober, 1866, rosary Sunday, the congregation consisted of between 20\r\nand 30 souls and they were from the surrounding country as much as from\r\nCedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Fr. Lowry (who was a convert to Catholicity) took charge of\r\nCedar Rapids and from that date we have a continued resident priest and\r\na regular history. Soon after his arrival he set to work to build a\r\nchurch more in keeping with the needs of the place, since at this time\r\nmany settlers had come from Illinois and things began to look more\r\nencouraging for our religion.\r\n\r\nThough his resources were limited, yet he had confidence that while the\r\npurses of the people were light, their hearts and their hands were\r\ngenerous. Nothing daunted, he put his hand to the plow and the result\r\nwas the front part of the present Immaculate Conception church. The\r\nfoundation in rock work was the gift of Mrs. J. J. Snouffer, Sr., who\r\nwas ever willing and generous to aid both the priest and the people,\r\nthough she was not of the household of the faith. I venture to predict\r\nthat her generosity and true Christian charity is on record in the\r\n\"Liber Scriptus\" and that it will not go unrewarded by the Just Judge.\r\n\r\nTo aid in the completion of this great work Fr. Lowry engaged both men\r\nand women, old and young. Among those who contributed materially in\r\nmoney and cooperation in every way we find the names of Mrs. J. J.\r\nSnouffer, Sr., Mrs. F. Lilly, Mrs. James Cook, the O'Hara family,\r\nHayden, Hager, Kehoe, Harrington, O'Keefe, Foley, Cook, Mullally,\r\nKeenan, Murray, Meehan, Langan, Cahill, Flaherty, McVann, Brecht, Peter\r\nFlynn, Killen, Thos. Murray. By the generous and combined efforts of\r\nthese and many others the desired end was attained and God's house was\r\na reality in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nHaving secured the church the next ambition of the good and zealous\r\nFather Lowry was to secure a parish school, wherein the foundation\r\nwould be laid and the seeds sown in future church members and pillars.\r\nThe first and only parish school up to this time was a modest and\r\nunpretentious institution in which a young lady named Caroline Hager\r\ntaught the children of the parish, who numbered about fifteen.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 under the direction of Father Lowry the following men were\r\nchief among those who built the school: James McNamara, John O'Hara,\r\nCharles O'Hara, Peter Flynn, Mr. Springer, Alexander Brecht, John and\r\nCharles Murray, the Cannons, Mullally, O'Briens, McVann, McDonalds.\r\n\r\nThe first Catholic cemetery was the present Bohemian Catholic cemetery\r\npurchased by John O'Hara, Peter Flynn, John Foley, John O'Keefe, and\r\nJames Barrett. The first Catholic buried in this cemetery was Mr.\r\nFlaherty, father of Pat. Flaherty of the west side. The second funeral\r\nheld there was that of Mrs. Martin Sheehan, about the year 1865.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 or thereabouts Fr. Lowry secured through Mr. Mullally the\r\nground for the present cemetery at Kenwood for a consideration of about\r\n$100.00. Then the old cemetery became the exclusive property of the\r\nBohemian Catholics of Cedar Rapids. This transfer was effected through\r\nFather Francis Chemlar for a consideration of $900.00. Of this amount\r\n$300.00 were contributed by E. R. and W. H. O'Hara. In 1880 Fr. Lowry\r\nwas transferred to Burlington and was succeeded by Father T. F. Gunn,\r\nof blessed memory. At this time many settlers had located around Cedar\r\nRapids and it began to be an important town. Soon the church had to be\r\nenlarged. In order to do so, the old parochial residence which was to\r\nthe rear of the church edifice had to be removed and a new residence\r\nconstructed. When this was accomplished, an addition was built to the\r\nchurch, giving it its present shape and dimensions. In the construction\r\nof this addition and all the incidental work that such changes entail\r\nas well as in the erection of a parochial house Father Gunn found\r\nplenty to do during his declining years in Cedar Rapids. He was not a\r\nman given to material building, as much as to the upbuilding of\r\nspiritual conditions in the hearts of his people. He was active and\r\nenergetic even to his dying day. He was in sympathy with his charge and\r\nlived in the heart of his congregation, not above them. He was a\r\nthorough christian gentleman, and a man of honor. He believed in\r\n\"being\" and not \"appearing,\" in doing and not in saying. He was the\r\nservant of his people, not their lord. He was a faithful follower of\r\nHim who forgot Himself in His care for others. No man ever held a\r\nwarmer place in the hearts of the people of Cedar Rapids than Father\r\nGunn. Even today his name is in benediction and his praises sung by\r\nnon-Catholic and Catholic alike.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Thos. F. Gunn was born at Strokestown, Roscommon county,\r\nIreland, December 3, 1840. He studied the classics in Ireland and\r\nphilosophy and theology at St. Francis Seminary, Milwaukee. He was\r\nordained priest at Cape Girardeau, Mo., in 1867. His first appointment\r\nwas to Cedar Falls, Iowa. At the time there was only one priest west of\r\nhim, at Fort Dodge. While stationed at Cedar Falls Father Gunn had\r\nunder his charge thirteen stations in Blackhawk, Grundy, Butler, and\r\nBremer counties. During these times a seventy-mile drive in a\r\nspringless wagon was a common experience.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Father Gunn was transferred to Sioux City. His charge was St.\r\nMary's parish which then consisted of a modest frame structure on West\r\nSeventh street, across Perry creek. At that time the priest's house\r\nconsisted of a one room structure. Father Gunn after a short time in\r\nSioux City was transferred to Dubuque Cathedral, where he remained\r\nthree and one-half years and went thence to Burlington, where he\r\nremained till 1880, when he came to Cedar Rapids to succeed Father\r\nLowry.\r\n\r\nAt his advent to Cedar Rapids the condition was much different from\r\nwhat it today presents. It was but an outpost of the onward march of\r\ncivilization and no one dreamt that the coming years would bring about\r\nso great a transformation as is today in evidence. Father Gunn was\r\ntwenty-six years in Cedar Rapids at the time of his death. Shortly\r\nbefore his death he delivered his last public address at the opening of\r\nthe semi-centennial celebration held on June 10, 1906, in which he\r\nforcibly manifested his liberal views and referred to the\r\ntransformation which had taken place within his memory in the city.\r\n\r\nFather Gunn died on June 24, 1906, and his funeral was one of the\r\nlargest and most representative ever held in Cedar Rapids. His eulogy\r\nwas delivered by Dr. J. J. Fitzpatrick, of Marshalltown, and the\r\nspeaker paid a becoming and merited tribute to the beloved and popular\r\nclergyman. His remains lie buried in Kenwood cemetery and the citizens\r\nof Cedar Rapids have erected a suitable monument to perpetuate his\r\nmemory and hold his name in benediction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOHEMIAN ST. WENCESLAUS CHURCH, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. WENCESLAUS SCHOOL, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Father Gunn, Father Toomey became pastor of\r\nImmaculate Conception church, which position he still occupies. Great\r\nhopes are held out by the people of Cedar Rapids congregation for the\r\nwelfare of the church interests. A new and commodious church is talked\r\nof and the hope entertained it will some day materialize. However as it\r\nis not becoming to praise the soldier while he is in the firing line,\r\nand as \"Praise after death\" has been my motto I must leave to the pen\r\nof the future historian to chronicle the deeds and sing the praises of\r\nthe present pastor of Immaculate Conception church.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. WENCESLAUS PARISH\r\n\r\nSt. Wenceslaus Bohemian Catholic parish of Cedar Rapids was established\r\nin 1874. Those through whose prayer and cooperation this new and\r\nindependent field of activity was called into existence were chiefly\r\nthe following: Thomas Brouzek, Vaclav Charipar, Natej Charipar, Thos.\r\nChadima, J. Hajek, Fr. Horek, Joseph Kofron, Jos. Pivouka, Vit Kuba,\r\nFr. Kofron, Hynek Krejic, V. Lessinger, Jos. Pivouka, V. Hrebec, H.\r\nSindelar, Jan Stolba, V. Stolba, Jos. Sefranek, Jan Tomanek, Votja\r\nZaruba, Ignace Sindelar, Mathew Kofron, Frank Biskop, Jan Vanous, Marie\r\nTuba, and some others from the surrounding country districts.\r\n\r\nA lot was purchased, and in August, 1874, the foundation of the first\r\nBohemian Catholic church in Cedar Rapids was begun. It was an eventful\r\nday for the Bohemian element in the city. In 1875 money was borrowed\r\nand collections made by parishioners, and all resources were drawn on\r\nto obtain the necessary means of perfecting the work already begun. In\r\n1878 the balance of the debt was paid by the united effort of a poor\r\nbut earnest people. In fact the donors, considering their\r\ncircumstances, were generous.\r\n\r\nIn those days of difficulty and want the parish was in charge of Father\r\nChemlar, who with all the zeal and earnestness of an apostle attended\r\nto the varied duties and needs of the scattered and needy congregation.\r\nFrom his limited salary of $200.00 he gave to the more needy and often\r\ndonated his time and talent without any consideration whatever. God be\r\nwith those days of disinterested and apostolic labors.\r\n\r\nThe old St. Wenceslaus church was a rock building 75×27 feet. It was\r\nwithout a tower. The bell was erected on an improvised structure in\r\nfront of the church and its silvery tones seemed to more effectively\r\naccomplish its mission and reach the hearts of the people, than our\r\ncostly and superior ones of today as they ring out from their costly\r\ntowers or tall minarets.\r\n\r\nTo house the good father of the flock, a modest parochial residence was\r\nbuilt by the people and in the basement of the unpretentious home,\r\nparish meetings were held and school was taught for years. It was in\r\nthe days of the good Father Chemlar also that the first Catholic\r\ncemetery was secured by the people of St. Wenceslaus parish.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Father Francis Chemlar was promoted to the charge at Norway,\r\nand he was succeeded at St. Wenceslaus by Father John Broz. Fr. Broz\r\nremained about two years in Cedar Rapids and during his short stay was\r\nby no means inactive. He added to the seating capacity of the church\r\nbuilding and also built a tower in the church.\r\n\r\nThe next pastor was Father Kopecky. To his zealous and persistent labor\r\nis due the parish school which still remains, in which the youth of the\r\nparish receive the rudiments of knowledge in things secular and\r\nreligious from the good Sisters of Mercy.\r\n\r\nAt this time the pastor's income was only $650.00, yet from this\r\ncomparatively modest sum the good father found a modest means of doing\r\nmaterial good for others and himself. He was a great school man and\r\noften spent hours in the school room, keeping at the class work. He\r\nwas popular with the people and accomplished much good.\r\n\r\nFollowing Father Kopecky came Fr. Vrba who remained only a short time\r\nand was transferred to Protovin.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the present incumbent, Rev. Florian Svrdlik, was installed\r\npastor of St. Wenceslaus. Soon after his advent a new church was spoken\r\nof and being a man of action as much as of word, he began to feel the\r\npulse of the parish on the matter. Seeing the interest and earnest\r\nmanner in which the new pastor took hold the people flocked to his aid\r\nand in a short time the work assumed practical shape. Ft. Svrdlik is\r\nnot a man who builds a church on paper years before he has his brick\r\nand mortar on the ground. He builds first and then talks of a reality\r\nand not of a dream. With the unanimous aid of the people, he organized\r\na fair, and from this realized about $4,000.00.\r\n\r\nThrough the other ordinary means of collections and donations this\r\namount was increased in a short time to the extent of $10,000.00. To\r\nthis fund his grace, Archbishop Keane, of Dubuque, contributed $500.00.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, 1903, the necessary property was secured, and on August\r\n4, 1904, the corner stone was laid, and on October 18, 1905, the new\r\nchurch was dedicated with solemn and impressive ceremony. The occasion\r\nwas one long to be remembered by the people of St. Wenceslaus and Cedar\r\nRapids in general. The new church is beautiful in design and faultless\r\nin execution. It was erected at a cost of about $40,000.00, a lasting\r\nmonument to the zeal and efficiency of the pastor and to the piety and\r\ngenerosity of the Bohemians of Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe parochial school erected in Father Kopecky's time is his\r\nimperishable monument. It is in charge of the Sisters of Mercy. It is a\r\nbeautiful building, plain and substantial in its style, spacious and\r\nwell ventilated and well calculated to develop a sound mind in a\r\nhealthy body. There are about 175 pupils at present attending the\r\nschool and sowing the seed which will enable them to develop into\r\nsturdy men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. PATRICK'S, CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's parish on the west side, Cedar Rapids, was organized\r\nApril 18, 1886. Its first resident pastor was Rev. T. F. Richardson,\r\nwho was transferred from Fairfax. The first parish church was a modest\r\nframe structure on Second avenue and Seventh street west. While its\r\nseating capacity was limited yet it gave ample accommodation for the\r\nfew parishioners, whose interests had heretofore been attended to, from\r\nthe parent church on the east side, and occasionally from Fairfax.\r\nFather Richardson retained the charge till the time of his death, which\r\noccurred on September 12, 1888. After his demise the interests of the\r\nyoung and struggling parish were entrusted to Rev. M. J. Quirk, who was\r\nsucceeded by the present incumbent, Rev. T. J. Sullivan who was\r\nappointed November 17, 1889.\r\n\r\nAt this time many were locating on the west side who retired from the\r\ncountry around to spend the evening of life in a well earned rest after\r\nenduring for years the trials and difficulties of pioneer conditions.\r\nSoon the little frame church became inadequate to the needs of the\r\nplace, and Father Sullivan, with that solicitude which has ever marked\r\nhis life and labor, began to entertain the wish of a more suitable\r\nbuilding. It did not take long for his efforts to be supported by the\r\nhand and heart of his people, and on October 18, 1891, the corner stone\r\nof the present beautiful building was laid. The late Very Rev. Father\r\nGunn officiated and the sermon on the occasion was delivered by the\r\nRev. C. M. Carroll, D. D.\r\n\r\nThe new church at First avenue and Fifth street, west was dedicated on\r\nAugust 28, 1892, by Bishop Hennessy, of Dubuque.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's church is one of the most sightly buildings in the city\r\nand when the frescoing which is now being done is completed it will be\r\none of the neatest houses of worship in the city.\r\n\r\nThe building when completed cost about $15,000.00. Father Sullivan took\r\ncharge of the parish about November 17, 1889. The congregation is now\r\nlarge and representative.\r\n\r\nHaving secured a beautiful church Father Sullivan's next undertaking\r\nwas the building of a school in keeping with the needs of the parish.\r\nThe corner stone of this beautiful and spacious building was laid on\r\nMay 10, 1902, by Dean Gunn.\r\n\r\nThe school is in charge of the Sisters of Charity of the B. V. M.,\r\nwhose mother house is at Mount Carmel, Dubuque. The Sisters of Charity\r\nas educators hold a similar place in the religious congregation of\r\nwomen to that occupied by the Jesuits among the male orders. They are\r\nthe leaders in their respective classes. And the pupils turned out by\r\nboth orders today are an honor to their alma mater.\r\n\r\nThere are several sodalities and societies attached to St. Patrick's\r\nchurch and the parish is growing rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AT PRAIRIEBURG\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that the first mass celebrated in Linn county was\r\nat Prairieburg. This assertion I have sought to establish, but have\r\nfailed, so I take it for what it is worth. As far as I can learn the\r\nfirst mass was said in a log house belonging to James Brislawn, but who\r\nthe priest was I have not been able to establish. The first authentic\r\nrecord we have is when Rev. P. J. Maher, late of De Witt, then at\r\nAnamosa, officiated in the home of Bernard McLaughlin in 1872. The\r\npresent brick church on the prairie at which a goodly number worship\r\nand which is in charge of Rev. Fr. I. J. Norris of Stone City, was\r\nerected by Fr. Maher in 1874. The Bohemian element who live in and\r\naround Prairieburg built a church a few years ago in the town. It is in\r\ncharge of Father Ballou of Oxford Junction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRFAX CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe first Catholic church in Fairfax was built by Fr. John in 1875.\r\nThis cradle of christianity in the wilds was located on the state road\r\nin Johnson county about six miles southeast of Fairfax. For the\r\nconstruction of this primeval temple oak logs were hauled from the\r\nHenderson mills on the Iowa river below Robert's Ferry. From this same\r\nmill, which was the only one at that time in these parts, except the\r\nSnouffer mills in Cedar Rapids, the early settlers hauled the lumber\r\nfor their log cabins and for the shelter sheds for their limited live\r\nstock. This pioneer church in Fairfax district was afterwards removed\r\nto Walford, later to the site of the present building.\r\n\r\nAfter Fr. John came Fr. Urbin occasionally from Norway. He returned to\r\nBohemia and died there.\r\n\r\nAmong the early settlers were John Flaherty, who came in 1855; John B.\r\nMurray in 1858, Wm. McNamara, Andrew Stark, whose children now enjoy\r\nthe fruits of his labors; the McDonalds, O'Connells, Donohues, Winekes,\r\nWickies, Brechts, Springer, Barretts, O'Hara, P. Flynn, Foleys, Cook,\r\nHaydens, Hager, Cahill, Langan, Killeen, Kehoe, Meehan, Harrington,\r\nLilly, Murray, Cannon, O'Brien.\r\n\r\nBefore this time however there were some scattered settlers in and\r\naround the site of the present town. Among the early settlers were\r\nThos. Murray, father of J. E. Murray and Charles Murray of this city,\r\nJohn B. Murray who came from Illinois in '56 or '58, and located in\r\nBenton county. John Flaherty, father of P. Flaherty, who came from\r\nIllinois in '55 by way of Iowa City. In those days there were very few\r\nsettlers and the country around was densely wooded where the wild deer\r\nand wolf held undisputed sway. The nearest and only Catholic church was\r\nin Iowa City and there the pioneers journeyed periodically to make\r\ntheir peace with God. There were no roads, and travelers were compelled\r\nto follow the beaten path through thicket and forest. In these\r\njourneyings danger and difficulty were ever present. The hardships\r\nendured for the sake of religion remind one of the experiences of Saul\r\nof Tarsus. Whenever Father Emmons came from Iowa City to Cedar Rapids,\r\nhis intention was declared some days before and a herald brought the\r\nglad news to the settlers who came in from their desert haunts and\r\nswelled the congregation at Cedar Rapids. These were literally the days\r\nwhen these faithful pioneers, poor in the world's goods but rich in\r\nfaith, hungered and thirsted after justice.\r\n\r\nWhen the church was built at Cedar Rapids the faithful at Fairfax were\r\nlooked after for some years till their number increased. Fr. Urbin, who\r\nwas stationed at Norway, later on also aided in keeping the lamp of\r\nfaith burning brightly. This was along about 1868. Later on Fr. John\r\nChemlar took care of their interests till in 1875 Father O'Farrell came\r\nto abide with the faithful of Fairfax and was their first resident\r\npriest.\r\n\r\nThe field of operation in Fairfax was too limited for the zeal of\r\nFather O'Farrell and he remained only a short time. He was succeeded by\r\nFather McCaffrey who was energetic in his labors, but because limited\r\nin his resources was not able to accomplish much, and time hung heavily\r\non his hands. He left soon after. After this time, however, things\r\nbegan to look more encouraging and we find some such sturdy men as John\r\nFlaherty, Thomas Murray, John Murray, Pat Harrington, Wm. Harrington,\r\nMaurice Cahill, Andrew Garrett, John Sears, Henry Wickie, putting their\r\nshoulders to the wheel and from their limited resources, giving\r\nmaterial aid in the upbuilding of conditions. The next resident priest\r\nwas Father Quinn who came from the east. He was a man of action. He set\r\nto work and organized the parish in practical shape and doubtless had\r\nhe been spared Fairfax would be today one of the leading parishes in\r\nLinn county. He died after two years from pneumonia contracted while\r\nattending to his flock.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Father Quinn, charge of affairs was assumed by\r\nFather Kelly, who was succeeded by Father Richardson, who enlarged the\r\nchurch edifice, which still remains a monument of early days and\r\npioneer conditions, but hardly in keeping with these days of opulence\r\nand ease. After about four years pastorate in Fairfax, during which\r\ntime he attended Cedar Rapids west side people, he was transferred to\r\nthe west side of Cedar Rapids and built the first church in that place.\r\n\r\nThis church was located at Second avenue and Fifth street west, and was\r\na frame structure 60×32 feet. It was at this time, April 18, 1886, that\r\nSt. Patrick's parish was first organized and Father Richardson was its\r\nfirst pastor and he retained the charge until his death in September,\r\n1888. Father John Brogan assumed the charge of Fairfax parish in April,\r\n1886, and remained seven years, during which time he labored earnestly\r\nfor the good of religion and was much beloved by the people. During his\r\npastorate he built a beautiful, well equipped modern residence, which\r\nstill remains and is occupied by the present incumbent. After Father\r\nBrogan's removal Father John Hogan assumed the charge of the Fairfax\r\nparish and during his stay of five years he labored zealously to pay\r\noff the indebtedness on the church property and has improved things\r\ngenerally. He afterwards exchanged Fairfax for his present charge Van\r\nHorne, and Father Thomas Reynolds of Van Horne came to Fairfax where he\r\nremained till his death. He was succeeded by the present pastor, Rev.\r\nP. Reynolds, who has done much to better conditions and who hopes one\r\nday to build a church in keeping with the present enviable status of\r\nthis wealthy community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LATE VERY REVEREND DEAN GUNN]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AT WALKER\r\n\r\nFor many years, the faithful of this town and the surrounding districts\r\nwere attended from Independence. In 1887 Very Rev. Fr. O'Dowd, of\r\nIndependence, erected a church at Walker, and for four years attended\r\nto the same from his home in Independence. In 1891 a new parish was\r\nestablished by Bishop Hennessy, and Rev. James Ryan, now of Calmar,\r\nIa., was appointed first resident pastor. Having a church already\r\nsecured the new pastor directed his zeal towards the erection of the\r\npresent parochial residence. While the parish was not numerically\r\nextensive, yet what it lacked in numbers was supplied in interest and\r\nzeal, and the new pastor in his apostolic spirit and unflagging zeal\r\nsoon had the good will of his congregation entirely at his disposal and\r\nwith their generous cooperation in hand and heart and as far as\r\ncircumstances permitted in currency, he erected a fine home for the use\r\nof the priest and had it paid for in a short time. During his stay of\r\nthree years in the parish he also improved and completed the conditions\r\nin church and church property which required attention. Fr. Ryan is the\r\nbest type of a truly apostolic priest, the zeal of God's house and the\r\nhappiness of God's people, being the single purpose which at all times\r\nanimates and actuates his life and action.\r\n\r\nAfter three years, Archbishop Hennessy, recognizing his earnestness and\r\nefficiency, assigned him to a new and more varied field of operation\r\nand he was succeeded at Walker by Rev. John McNamara, now of Key West,\r\nDubuque. Fr. McNamara's stay in Walker was of only short duration,\r\nabout three months, when in obedience to the wish of authority he went\r\nto Key West. After his departure the present pastor, Rev. Wm. Leen,\r\nassumed jurisdiction and his stay in Walker for sixteen years is the\r\nexplanation of the present flourishing condition of the parish. Vast\r\nimprovements have been effected, in the church and church property, and\r\ntoday Walker takes its place not only among the Catholic churches in\r\nLinn county but among the churches in any county in the state.\r\n\r\nThe pastor is a most zealous and priestly man, an erudite scholar and a\r\nprofound and persistent student. He is not selfish, and generously\r\ngives of the fruits of his research through the columns of pamphlet and\r\npress. Fr. Leen also occasionally lets his thoughts run along metrical\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nBesides Walker, Fr. Leen also extends his zeal and paternal care to\r\nRowley and another mission station which is not in Linn county. But\r\nwhile frequently engaged in historical research, and contributing to\r\ncurrent literature, he finds abundant time and opportunity to feed the\r\nsheep and the lambs over which he is shepherd and does his duty so well\r\nthat he is most popular not only with his charge but with the community\r\nin general.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARION CHURCH\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest churches in Linn county today is St. Joseph's at\r\nMarion. It was built by the present pastor, Father P. M. Loughvane.\r\nLike most other places in Linn county the early settlers in Marion had\r\nto endure hardships for their religion. The settlers were few and far\r\nbetween and the only consolation they had from a religious standpoint\r\nwas the occasional visit of a missionary priest from some outside\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1855 and 1856 a good priest named Father Smith came\r\noccasionally from Iowa City to minister to their needs and preach them\r\na word of encouragement. In those days Father Emmons also came from\r\nIowa City and contributed to keep the lamp of faith burning. Father\r\nLaurent, of Muscatine, also came to Marion occasionally and did\r\nmissionary work among the pioneers.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the faithful journeyed to Iowa City whenever the weather\r\npermitted. In these days there were no automobiles nor telephone\r\nservice, and it was not at all uncommon for the travelers to be\r\nweather bound on their way to or from the scene of their religious\r\nobservance. Sometimes they had to sleep all night in the wagon in the\r\nmidst of the woods when the swollen streams prevented their going any\r\nfarther. It looks like something one may read about, but there are\r\nthose living today who recall it as a fact. Waiting till the river\r\nflowed by, or at least till its current became less rapid, or till the\r\nhidden ford appeared--such were the trials of pioneer days in Linn\r\ncounty, and such the tests the faithful were subjected to.\r\n\r\nAfter 1870, Marion was attended by Father Lowry, of Cedar Rapids. After\r\nFather Lowry's time the faithful of Marion were attended by Father\r\nRichardson, of Fairfax, and after his transfer to St. Patrick's he\r\ncontinued to minister to their needs. His successor, Father McQuirk,\r\ncontinued to assist in bringing the consolations of religion to the\r\nearly settlers. In later days Father John Brogan, of Fairfax,\r\nministered to their needs whenever time and opportunity permitted.\r\n\r\nFather Timothy Sullivan, after his appointment to St. Patrick's, also\r\nministered to their needs and to this day has many friends who are\r\nmindful of his kindness in the days of want.\r\n\r\nThe first resident priest in Marion was Father Laffin, who came in\r\n1890. At this time and indeed previous to this the chief settlers in\r\nthe Marion district were the Senekir family, the Reillys, the Davises,\r\nColburts, Zimmermans, and Zackeries, and these were the first who took\r\nhold and established the first church.\r\n\r\nThe church, by reason of the fewness of its members, was a difficult\r\nproblem to maintain. It was supported chiefly by the active and\r\nenergetic assistance of the people in holding sociables and picnics and\r\nsuch other ways and means as were worthy of the noble cause.\r\n\r\nWhen the building was completed there was an indebtedness of $1,800,\r\nand nothing to pay this amount from. The sale of the property was\r\nthreatened by those who held the lien on the church. But the zealous\r\nand hard-working members of the congregation set to work, and in two\r\nyears this amount was paid off.\r\n\r\nAfter Father Laffin's departure the charge was taken by Rev. J.\r\nHartigan, now at Strawberry Point. For eight years this zealous and\r\ninterested young priest labored early and late for the welfare and\r\ncomfort of his flock. During his time the present parochial residence\r\nwas erected at a cost of $3,000. It is a modest, unpretentious\r\nbuilding, but fitted up with all the modern systems of hygienic and\r\nhealthful appliances. Not content with being comfortably housed\r\nhimself, Father Hartigan decided to secure also a becoming habitation\r\nfor his Lord and Master. He decided that a new church was now a matter\r\nof necessity in Marion, and gradually he got the members of the\r\ncongregation to his way of thinking. He held fairs and sociables to\r\nobtain the necessary funds to make his dream a reality, and at his\r\ntransfer from Marion he left in the church treasury more than $2,000 as\r\na nucleus for the new church building. The completion of the work was,\r\nhowever, reserved for his no less interested and zealous successor.\r\n\r\nWriting of the conditions in Marion at his appointment, Fr. Hartigan\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"I got my appointment to the charge in the winter of 1896,\r\n     about December 1st, and I shall never forget my feelings on\r\n     arriving there. I found the parish in excellent condition to\r\n     try a man's grit and patience. There were about thirty-five\r\n     families, more or less actively engaged in parish work.\r\n     There was a debt of upwards of $3,000, with no home except a\r\n     log cabin, and an old church that had stood the test of the\r\n     winters' blast for well nigh forty years. I heard murmurs on\r\n     all sides, some thinking that all their property would be\r\n     lost. I had many expressions of sympathy. I told the people\r\n     in very few words that I was not looking for sympathy\r\n     (although I needed it), that I was sent there to work, that\r\n     works, not words, were of more avail in those circumstances.\r\n     I tried to arouse their fainting spirits and told them to go\r\n     and put their shoulder to the wheel, which they did with a\r\n     willingness and energy that was beyond my most ardent\r\n     aspirations. In about two years we had the parish clear of\r\n     debt. Then it was necessary to build a home to supplant the\r\n     poor log cabin, one of the old landmarks that did its work\r\n     for well nigh half a century. To show the dilapidated\r\n     condition of that abode I may say that I was frequently\r\n     compelled to move my bed around to escape the rainfall. But\r\n     thanks to the generosity of the people and their willingness\r\n     to work and to give, the home was built in almost as short a\r\n     time as it would take to tell it. It was a gigantic\r\n     undertaking at the time, but where there is a will there is\r\n     a way, and the home was built and paid for in about one year\r\n     after the church property debt was liquidated. That home\r\n     cost about $3,000, and every cent was paid before it was\r\n     occupied. Then the cement sidewalks were laid at a cost of\r\n     about $120, and last but not least came the greatest\r\n     struggle of all. The parish had progressed so far so well,\r\n     and it was my desire and the people's desire that their work\r\n     should be crowned with success. The crowning work of all was\r\n     the building of that magnificent little church that now\r\n     stands on the corner of Tenth street. It was not my\r\n     privilege to see it built before I left the parish, but for\r\n     that purpose the people and myself labored tooth and nail in\r\n     season and out of season, so that when I got my appointment\r\n     to Strawberry Point in October, 1904, I turned over to the\r\n     present pastor upwards of $2,000. I may say before I close\r\n     that the spiritual advancement of the people more than kept\r\n     pace with the material development of the parish.\"\r\n\r\nRev. P. M. Loughnane, the present pastor of St. Joseph's, was born in\r\nCounty Kerry, Ireland. He received his classical education at St.\r\nBrendan's Seminary, Killarney, and studied philosophy and theology at\r\nSt. Patrick's College, Thurles, where he was ordained to the priesthood\r\non June 18, 1803. Coming to Dubuque, he was assigned as assistant to\r\nVery Rev. E. McLoughlin, at St. Mary's, Clinton, Iowa. He was\r\nafterwards transferred to take charge of the parish at Sabula. Thence\r\nhe went to State Center, in Marshall county, where he remained eight\r\nyears. While at State Center he interested himself much in school work\r\nwhich he loved. Fr. Loughnane is a versatile scholar, a man of bright\r\nmind, and keen sense of discernment. His ability as a priest he has\r\ndemonstrated by the beautiful new church which will ever remain a\r\nmonument to his competency and the earnestness and worth of his people.\r\nBearing in mind that the congregation at Marion is not numerically\r\nlarge nor gifted with the possession of any too much of this world's\r\ngoods, the sacrifices they made for the new church are much enhanced.\r\nThe greater number of the members of the charge are railroad employees\r\nand more or less of a fluctuating class. But the Catholic heart is cold\r\nand callous, indeed, that cannot grow eloquent with faith when\r\ncontemplating the visible, the material evidence of a great personal\r\nsacrifice for the faith.\r\n\r\nSoon after his advent to St. Joseph's parish the pastor applied all his\r\nenergy to collect for the new church, and by earnest and energetic\r\neffort raised about $5,000, each and every member of the congregation\r\ndoing his or her duty in a manner truly admirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH AT LISBON\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest, if not the mother church in Linn county, is that at\r\nLisbon. We have evidence of its existence and of early settlers for\r\nwhose use it was erected dating as far back as 1854. Records show that\r\nFr. Emmons, of Iowa City, the father of Catholicity in Linn county,\r\nmade frequent visits to the little town, and baptized and ministered to\r\nthe needs of the early settlers. Even farther back than 1854 it is on\r\nrecord that this pioneer of the faith offered the holy sacrifice and\r\nadministered the holy sacraments in the home of Thomas McAllister, east\r\nof the town of Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThere are those living today who remember these times and conditions,\r\nand the fact is not questioned that some of the present members of the\r\nLisbon congregation were regenerated by the saving waters of baptism in\r\nthe home of Thomas McAllister, and it is even possible to meet\r\noccasionally those who well remember Father Emmons and his teaching.\r\n\r\nIt was through the efforts of this faithful pioneer shepherd, aided by\r\nthe good will and support of the scattered few, that the old church of\r\nLisbon was called into existence, and it is through veneration for the\r\npastor and the pioneer that it is still allowed to stand, though no\r\nlonger used for divine worship. This old landmark was erected in 1854.\r\nThe site on which the little edifice was erected was donated by Jacob\r\nS. Pfautz, who also contributed to the present church building. Be it\r\nsaid to their eternal honor that among the contributors for the first\r\nchurch there are several names which are not belonging to the limited\r\nlist of Catholics of those days.\r\n\r\nAmong the pioneers of those days we find such names as Peter Heller,\r\nGeorge Ringer, Mike Hoover, Samuel Bell, Fred Rabenau, William Andre,\r\nThomas McClelland, I. G. Trigenfuse, Sam Ellison, John Walton, J. A.\r\nMcClelland, Joseph Owens, Thomas Andre, and others.\r\n\r\nFather Emmons was only a missionary in Lisbon at the time his home\r\ncharge was Iowa City, but as far as preaching and teaching the word and\r\nbreaking the bread of life to the children of the faith his\r\njurisdiction was not confined by any boundary or limitation.\r\n\r\nThe first resident pastor of Lisbon was Rev. W. Downey, who resided\r\nthere for about three years after his term of service. Father Daly\r\nfollowed, and for a short time resided in Lisbon, and afterwards in\r\nMechanicsville, and is spending the evening of his life in Atlantic,\r\nIowa. After this time Lisbon was attached to Marion and was attended\r\nfor a while by Father Laffin. When Father Hartigan succeeded to the\r\ncharge at Marion he also attended Lisbon.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved, however, to the present popular pastor of Marion, Rev.\r\nP. M. Loughnane, to add another laurel to his crown by replacing the\r\nold time-honored landmark with the present ornate and well designed\r\nchurch building.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic cemetery, which is a part of the property of this charge,\r\nwas purchased in Father Downey's time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SISTERS OF MERCY\r\n\r\nThe Sisters of Mercy came to Cedar Rapids on the Feast of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, 22d July, 1875. They came from Davenport, which at that time\r\nwas subject to Dubuque Bishop for there was only one diocese in Iowa.\r\nSister Mary Isadore and Sister Mary Gertrude were the first to visit\r\nCedar Rapids, and in a few weeks afterwards Sister Mary Agatha and\r\nSister Mary Francis came. These four formally took possession of the\r\nbuilding which had been secured for school purposes, and in September,\r\n1875, St. Joseph's Academy and parish school was opened for the first\r\ntime in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nThis community at Cedar Rapids remained subject to the mother house in\r\nDavenport until 1881, when the southern part of the state was cut off\r\nand made a new diocese. This new division of the Dubuque diocese\r\nnecessitated the subjection of the Cedar Rapids community to the\r\ndiocese of Dubuque and so the branch house became an independent\r\ncommunity in November, 1881.\r\n\r\nAt this time the community at Cedar Rapids consisted of about ten\r\nSisters, and there were about twenty-five boarders at St. Joseph's\r\nAcademy at the time.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the installation of Father Quinn as pastor of Immaculate\r\nConception church the parish school was independent of the academy.\r\nAfter this they were united and the academic school became a free\r\nschool for all those who were unable to pay for tuition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUAKER OATS TRAIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE ON CEDAR RIVER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. PATRICK'S CHURCH, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\nThis arrangement continued till the spring of 1905, when the Sisters\r\nsecured the beautiful house and property known as Mound Farm, on which\r\nthey now have a beautiful mother house and academy. Up to 1905 St.\r\nJoseph's was the mother house of the Cedar Rapids community. Now the\r\nmother house is at \"the Mound.\"\r\n\r\nThe new Sacred Heart Academy opened in September, 1905, with thirty\r\nboarders. It is situated on the same location as the mother house of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nFrom the Cedar Rapids mother house of the Sisters of Mercy the\r\nfollowing branch houses have been and are supplied: Decorah, Grand\r\nJunction, Anamosa, Manchester, De Witt, Charles City, Elma, Oelwein,\r\nBernard, New Haven, Waterloo, Marion, St. Wenceslaus, St. Joseph's,\r\nCedar Rapids, with Mercy Hospital, and a new hospital at Kalispel,\r\nMontana.\r\n\r\nIn the community at present there are about one hundred and thirty\r\nmembers. In the novitiate or preparatory school for aspirants to the\r\nSisterhood there are about forty young ladies laying the foundation for\r\ntheir future life work.\r\n\r\nAny attempt at church history in a state or in a city would be\r\nincomplete without honorable mention of the Sisters. The history of the\r\nparish school is also the history of the Sisters, that glorious body of\r\nwomen who have given and who give their lives to the uplifting of the\r\nhuman race. That branch of the Sisterhood which devotes their lives to\r\nteaching is one of the most powerful allies the church has in keeping\r\nher members faithful. The teaching orders are not alone in the work of\r\neducation. The Sisters have done a great work on the battle field and\r\nin hospitals in opening the eyes of the world to the great ends sought\r\nby the church.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCY HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThere are many orders, each doing their own work in their own place.\r\nWherever there is work to be done, or good deeds to be performed, there\r\nwe find the Sisters with an eye single to their work and looking for\r\ntheir reward in the world to come. To come from general to particulars,\r\nI would be untrue to my promise if I did not call particular attention\r\nto one institution in particular, namely, Mercy Hospital. There are few\r\nCatholics in Iowa who are not acquainted with Mercy Hospital, Cedar\r\nRapids, and the great work being done by the Sisters of Mercy.\r\n\r\nThe absolute need for such an institution became so much a necessity in\r\nCedar Rapids that on November 15, 1900, the Sisters for the first time\r\nbegan operations in an old residence quite near their convent. For\r\nthree years, under conditions entirely inadequate, they ministered to\r\nthe needs of their constantly increasing patrons, till they were\r\ncompelled by necessity and their rapidly increasing work to build the\r\npresent institution, which compares favorably with any similar\r\ninstitution in the country and offers every facility to the medical\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nThe corner stone of this beautiful building was laid on August 15,\r\n1902, and the building was completed by December 1, 1903. It cost over\r\n$100,000. It is in charge of the Sisters of Mercy of Cedar Rapids\r\ncommunity, who also have charge of Sacred Heart Academy on Mound Farm,\r\nand of St. Joseph's parochial school, with St. Wenceslaus' school and\r\nSt. Berchman's Seminary, Marion, together with several schools through\r\nIowa, and of the Mercy Hospital at Kalispel, Montana.\r\n\r\nSo great has been the success of this institution that there is need at\r\npresent for an addition. There is a large training school for nurses in\r\nwhich at present there are twenty-five pupils. The management of the\r\ninstitution is accomplished by the Sisters, who at present number about\r\nfifteen, among whom there are seven qualified trained nurses.\r\n\r\nAbility of more than ordinary character is required to manage\r\nsuccessfully an institution like Mercy Hospital. And as the work\r\nincreases the greater the strain on the management. This position of\r\ntrust and responsibility has been capably filled for nearly ten years\r\nby Sister Mary Alphonsus. She it was who first assumed charge of the\r\nlittle hospital on Third avenue. She has seen that mustard seed grow\r\ninto the present beautiful institution. Sister Alphonsus, always\r\nsolicitous for the comfort of others, overtaxed her limited strength.\r\nNever physically strong, she has given herself most generously in\r\nconstant care and vigilance to the duties of her responsible position.\r\nForgetting herself to be of help to others, it is not surprising that\r\nher frail constitution should give way, when one considers the\r\nresponsibility of her position. This fact, coupled with the recent\r\ndeath of her beloved mother, to whom she was much attached, almost\r\ncompletely undermined her physical condition, and acting on the advice\r\nof her medical adviser and that of her superior mother, N. Teresa,\r\nSister Alphonsus retired from the hospital to recuperate her failing\r\nstrength. During her years of office she made herself a general\r\nfavorite with all with whom she had to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRED HEART ACADEMY\r\n\r\nThis high grade school fills a long felt want in Cedar Rapids and Linn\r\ncounty. There is no more suitable location for a young ladies' academy\r\nthan Cedar Rapids, and for its site there is not perhaps in the west a\r\nplace more suited than where the Sacred Heart Academy stands. Situated\r\non the highest elevation, perhaps, in the county, it is by nature and\r\nthe skill and taste admirably fitted to generate both sound minds and\r\nhealthy bodies. Recently a new addition has been built to the former\r\nacademy.\r\n\r\nThe church realizes that true progress is the law which God has given\r\nto His creation. Any progress is creation continued. The gospel of\r\nChrist is the gospel of progress. The mind to be progressive must seek\r\nHim and find Him, and finding Him, be of value to the child and the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThis the church understands better than she gets credit for, and this\r\nis the reason why her parish school is her first care after her own\r\nexistence has been established. Hence any attempt at her history which\r\nwould not include her schools would be incomplete and dwarfed. In the\r\nschool is sown the seed which is afterwards nursed and cared for by the\r\nchurch, in its life-giving sacramental system.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief parish schools in Linn county is Sacred Heart Academy,\r\nat Green Mound Farm. It is a school for young ladies in which are\r\ntaught all subjects which qualify candidates for the varied positions\r\nto which they may wish to aspire, such as teaching, bookkeeping,\r\nstenography, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nSt. Berchman's Seminary at Marion is a boarding school for boys who\r\nhave not attained the age of fourteen. In this school, which is in\r\ncharge of the Sisters of Mercy of Cedar Rapids, the most approved\r\nmethods are employed in imparting thorough and comprehensive\r\ninstruction in all the elementary branches of an English education,\r\ntogether with a marked attention to the moral culture of the boys,\r\nwhich makes them an honor to their parents and society. Careful\r\nattention is given to their physical needs and bodily comfort, and\r\ndiligent care is extended in seeing that their time in the seminary is\r\nput to the best advantage. Music and elocution are among the subjects\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\nThe seminary is located on First avenue and Fifteenth street. It is\r\nsituated on a twenty acre area, beautifully wooded, and affording\r\nexcellent facilities for outdoor games which boys usually indulge in.\r\n\r\nThe seminary has its own sources of supply in all edible stuffs. It has\r\na beautiful orchard and vegetable gardens, and its needs in the way of\r\ndairy produce and poultry are supplied from its own farm. While within\r\nthe city limits, it is far removed from noise and all disturbing\r\nelements which may in any way militate against the best results.\r\n\r\nThe apartments are spacious and are furnished with every modern\r\nimprovement conducive to health and comfort. The building is heated by\r\nsteam, well ventilated, and lighted by electricity. Hot and cold water\r\nare in use for the bath system. At the present time a large addition is\r\nbeing built to meet the needs of the increasing patronage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n_Linn County Statistics_\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the greatest number of people to the square mile was in the\r\nextreme southeastern part of the territory. This was but natural, as\r\nnearly all the settlers had come by river from St. Louis, only a few\r\ncoming by wagons up to this time. The settlers had in part come up\r\nalong the Red Cedar river, and Linn county claimed a population of\r\n1,373, few of whom had lived more than two years in the county.\r\nSettlers also ascended the Iowa and Des Moines rivers. By 1850 land\r\nseekers had followed the Des Moines river and had already found homes\r\nas far west as Boone county.\r\n\r\nIt was a severe blow to the agricultural interests of Linn county and\r\nthe newborn state when news of the gold fever reached the borders. Not\r\nonly the newspapers stirred up the people, but hundreds of parties\r\ncrossed the state in wagons, stopped along the way and talked\r\nincessantly about the great diggings in California. The young men were\r\nfired with enthusiasm. Work on the farm was hard and the returns small.\r\nThus Linn county lost many of its best and most enterprising young men.\r\nSome, it is true, returned again after a stay of a few years in the\r\ngold fields, but a large number never came back, but either died or\r\nremained on the coast. While Linn county lost many settlers it also\r\ngained others, who started west expecting to join mining parties, but\r\nwho settled down as farmers instead. From 1849 to 1857 was a restless\r\nera of migration in what we call the middle west. In fact it extended\r\nover the entire country. There were many causes for this. An era of\r\nprosperity sprang up after the Mexican war, the gold discoveries and\r\nthe opening up of much fertile land by the government. All this, no\r\ndoubt, stirred people to find new homes or seek new adventures. The\r\npanic of '57 of course for a time put a stop to all speculations,\r\nespecially in western lands.\r\n\r\nThe greatest influx of people into the state was from 1850 to 1856,\r\nwhen the population increased from 192,214 to 517,875, an increase of\r\n169.4 per cent. The population of the state for 1910 is 2,225,771. Linn\r\ncounty felt the same influx, for the population increased from 5,444 in\r\n1850 to 14,702 in 1856.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been an increase of about 8,000 by the census of\r\n1860, showing that while the panic may have kept some at home who might\r\nhave gone west, few new settlers sought the west to make new homes. The\r\npopulation of the county and the towns will give the reader an idea of\r\nthe gradual growth in the population.\r\n\r\nHere are some figures showing our development:\r\n\r\nIn May, 1838, the population of the county was 205. This had increased\r\nto 2,643 in 1844. In 1847 we had 3,954 people, 4,762 in 1849, 5,444 in\r\n1850, 6,870 in 1852, 10,802 in 1856, 18,947 in 1860, 18,693 in 1863,\r\nshowing the effects of the Civil war, this conflict not only taking\r\nmany of our substantial citizens to serve in the armies, but for the\r\ntime impeding emigration.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the figures had increased to 20,754, in 1867 to 24,549, in 1870\r\nto 31,080, in 1875 to 31,875, in 1880 to 37,237, in 1885 to 40,720, in\r\n1890 to 45,303, in 1895 to 49,905, in 1900 to 55,392, and in 1905 to\r\n57,362.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERCY HOSPITAL, CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\nAt the time this is being written the population for the county for\r\n1910 has not been announced.\r\n\r\nThe cities and the towns of the county have grown with it.\r\n\r\nCedar Rapids in 1885 had 15,426 people; in 1890, 18,020; in 1895,\r\n21,555; in 1900, 25,656; in 1905, 28,759; and in 1910, 32,870.\r\n\r\nMarion in 1885 had a population of 2,673; in 1890, 3,094; in 1895,\r\n3,766; in 1900, 4,102; in 1905, 4,112.\r\n\r\nMt. Vernon boasted of 859 people in 1885, 1,259 in 1890, 1,178 in 1895,\r\n1,629 in 1900, and 1,664 in 1905.\r\n\r\nLisbon's population in 1885 was 703. No statistics are available for\r\n1890, but in 1895 the town had 817 people, 956 in 1900, and 948 in\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nThe population of Center Point in 1885 was 565; in 1890, 615; in 1895,\r\n595; in 1900, 674; and in 1905, 823.\r\n\r\nSpringville in 1885 was credited with 561; in 1890, 518; in 1895, 562;\r\nin 1900, 509; and in 1905, 582.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the population of Central City was given as 467; in 1895, 594;\r\nin 1900, 623; and in 1905, 607.\r\n\r\nWalker in 1895 had 485 people, 505 in 1900, and 571 in 1905.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is of interest to note that in 1836 the\r\npopulation of Wisconsin Territory, of which Iowa was then a part, west\r\nof the Mississippi river was, Dubuque county 4,274, Des Moines county\r\n6,257, or a total of 10,531.\r\n\r\nA second census was taken in 1838, which showed that there were in\r\nsixteen counties organized from the original two counties a population\r\nof 22,859. Jones county had 241 people at this time, Cedar 557, Johnson\r\n237, and Linn 205.\r\n\r\nIn the first constitutional convention, which met at Iowa City October\r\n7, 1844, and adjourned November 1, 1844, this county was represented by\r\nThomas J. McKean, Samuel W. Durham, L. M. Strong.\r\n\r\nThe constitution adopted by this convention was rejected by the people\r\nat an election held August 4, 1845, the vote being, for 7,235, against\r\n7,656.\r\n\r\nIn the second constitutional convention, which met at Iowa City May 4,\r\n1846, and adjourned May 19, the county was represented by Socrates H.\r\nTryon.\r\n\r\nAt the election on August 3, 1846, this constitution was adopted by the\r\npeople by a small majority. It was presented to congress in December,\r\n1846, and on the 28th of the same month an act was passed for the\r\nadmission of Iowa into the Union.\r\n\r\nThe third constitutional convention sat in Iowa City from January 19 to\r\nMarch 3, 1857, and adopted a constitution which was ratified by the\r\npeople on August 3 following. In this convention Linn's representative\r\nwas Hosea W. Gray.\r\n\r\nIn this county the vote on the constitution was 1,307 yes, 955 no. In\r\nthe state the vote was, yes 40,000, no 38,681. The result shows the\r\nfirst sign of a change in the political sentiment in state and county.\r\nThe republicans favored the constitution, and the democrats opposed it.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the members of the General Assembly from Linn county from\r\n1846 to date.

Good, Cedar\r\nRapids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n_The Bridges Across the Cedar at Cedar Rapids and Early Steamboating on\r\nthe Cedar River_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most enterprising men who devoted all his time to the\r\nupbuilding of Kingston, which later became part of Cedar Rapids, was\r\nDavid W. King, who arrived a short time after Robert Ellis. Mr. King\r\nand the settlers on the west side of the river early devised schemes by\r\nwhich to get in touch with the east side and the county seat. True, it\r\nwas all right when the river was frozen over and in summer when the\r\nriver was down so that it was safe to ford the stream, but there were\r\ntimes when it was impossible to ford the river on account of high\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nD. W. King obtained a license to operate a ferry across the river,\r\nwhich he continued to run up to the time of his death in 1854. This\r\nferry was operated till about 1857 when the bridges were opened. Even\r\nfor some time after the first bridge was put in operation did the ferry\r\ndo much business, as the first bridge soon after it had been completed\r\nwent out with the flood in the spring of '57, and the second bridge,\r\nfinished that fall, also went out by an ice gorge in January the next\r\nyear. Then for a time the ferry was used from and to May's Island as\r\nthe bridge from the east side to May's Island had been properly erected\r\nso as to stand the floods.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a ferry at this point brought trade to Cedar\r\nRapids and accomplished much in making Cedar Rapids a business center,\r\nto which place travelers and others came. It was not till many years\r\nlater that free bridges could be offered to the citizens of the town.\r\nBut in this respect the city was ahead of other cities of the state.\r\n\r\nIt was David W. King who early began a toll bridge, and it is said that\r\n\"when the boulder in the river near the Watrous mill was visible the\r\nearly pioneer could with safety drive across the river.\" If it was not\r\nthey had to pay for crossing on the toll bridge. David King's ferry was\r\nthe first step in the direction of progress in Cedar Rapids. By virtue\r\nof a law which went into effect December 22, 1848, Mr. King was\r\nauthorized to establish and keep a ferry across Cedar river at a point\r\nin Linn county opposite Cedar Rapids for a term of ten years with\r\nexclusive privilege for the space of one mile on either side. Here King\r\nfor a number of years did a thriving business, and Cedar Rapids\r\nreceived the benefits of the trade which extended west into Benton\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BRIDGE\r\n\r\nIn an old paper, being part of the records of the house passed January\r\n23, 1853, the following may be found: \"An Act to create a Board of\r\nCommissioners with authority to erect a free bridge across the Cedar\r\nRiver at Cedar Rapids in Linn County.\r\n\r\n     \"SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the\r\n     State of Iowa that John M. May, Frederick A. Williams and\r\n     Gabriel Carpenter be and are hereby appointed and\r\n     constituted a Board of Commissioners to receive voluntary\r\n     subscriptions in trust for the erection of a free bridge\r\n     across the Cedar river at Cedar Rapids in Rapids Township,\r\n     Linn County, with a draw of not less than forty feet in\r\n     said bridge for the free passage of boats and other craft\r\n     navigating said river.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2. Provided, that the Board should furnish Bonds in\r\n     the sum of $20,000.00 to be approved by the County Judge of\r\n     Linn County.\r\n\r\n     \"Sec. 4. Providing, that the construction of the bridge\r\n     should be begun within ninety days from the time of the\r\n     beginning to collect subscriptions and that the bridge\r\n     should be completed within two years from the time that\r\n     active work was begun.\"\r\n\r\nThis bridge was begun in the fall of 1856 and completed during the\r\nwinter of 1856 and 1857. It was located below May's Island at the foot\r\nof Daniels street, now Seventh avenue. This bridge was really gotten up\r\nto spring a real estate boom in property owned by Carpenter, Major May\r\nand others on the west side of the river. It is said Major May himself\r\nsubscribed $1,000. However, the location of the bridge was ideal. It\r\nwas needed and was something the people of the town took a great pride\r\nin; in the early day toll bridges were the rule and not the exception.\r\nDuring the early spring of 1857 this bridge in a high flood was carried\r\naway and two sisters by the name of Black, living on the west side and\r\nwho were crossing the bridge at the time, lost their lives.\r\n\r\nDuring the following summer there was much agitation for a bridge,\r\nespecially by the people having real estate and residing on the west\r\nside of the river and farmers who had located in the western part of\r\nthe county as well as in southeast Benton county. During the summer a\r\nfloating bridge was built across the river at what is known now as\r\nFirst avenue. This was also a short lived bridge, having been carried\r\naway by the ice gorge in the spring of 1858.\r\n\r\nDuring the same summer materials were secured and some was saved from\r\nthe old bridge and a temporary bridge was erected across May's Island,\r\nbetween May's Island and east Cedar Rapids, while on the west side a\r\nferry boat was used. In February, 1855, the county court granted a\r\nlicense for twenty-five years to H. G. Angle for the erection and\r\nmaintenance of a toll bridge at First avenue. It provided that no other\r\ntoll bridge should be erected on the river for two years within two\r\nmiles on either side of this contemplated toll bridge. In the decree of\r\nthe court it was also mentioned that in case a free bridge was\r\nconstructed within two miles a reasonable sum of money should be paid\r\nto the person or company owning the toll bridge. This toll privilege\r\nwas transferred in the following year to George Greene, John Weare,\r\nWilliam Greene, P. W. Earle, A. F. Steadman, H. E. Higley, N. B. Brown,\r\nLowell and Lawson Daniels, E. H. Dobbs, J. J. Child, and J. P. Rogers.\r\nThis bridge, however, was not opened for traffic until the winter of\r\n1859-60. The stockholders were made up of Cedar Rapids people, and at\r\none time the stock was above par. The prices charged were as follows:\r\n25 cents for a double team and wagon; for driving cattle 5 cents a\r\nhead: for driving sheep 3 cents a head; and for pedestrians 1 cent\r\neach. Some time later reduction was made by the management for round\r\ntrip ticket holders. Many squabbles were had over these tickets. It is\r\nsaid that an Irishman came to T. J. Dudley, Jr., wanting to start suit\r\nfor preventing him returning, he having lost his round trip ticket, and\r\noffering him $10.00. Mr. Dudley quietly went down to the office of the\r\ncompany and told the man to cross. He was permitted to do so and\r\nwillingly parted with his $10.00 to Dudley, the latter paying the\r\ncustomary price to the gatekeeper. This story of Dudley's wit, showing\r\nhow a lawyer got the best of it, was repeated in many families in Cedar\r\nRapids, and as a consequence a number of young men took up the study of\r\nlaw for a profession.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years citizens residing in west Cedar Rapids and in the\r\neastern part of the county made various attempts for a free bridge\r\nacross the river. Much of the grain and produce came from Benton county\r\nand the western part of Linn county. A number of grain merchants and\r\nothers were located on that side of the river and had their grain in\r\nstorage at that place and were asking the railroad authorities for\r\npermission to erect freight houses on that side of the river. A number\r\nof citizens of Cedar Rapids who were interested in Kingston real estate\r\nalso attempted this enterprise, believing that the time was not far\r\ndistant before Kingston would become the more important town of the\r\ntwo. A petition was circulated for a free bridge across the Cedar river\r\nand presented to the board of supervisors to take the matter under\r\nconsideration. At the January term, 1871, the board appropriated\r\n$14,000 for the purpose, providing that the city or citizens of Cedar\r\nRapids, or both, should guarantee to furnish the balance of such sum as\r\nshould be necessary to pay for a first-class iron bridge across the\r\nCedar. It was further provided that no part of the county funds should\r\nbe expended until the whole sum necessary had been raised by\r\nsubscription or otherwise. The citizens of Cedar Rapids, and others\r\ninterested in the city, at once circulated petitions for funds and also\r\nauthorized the mayor of Cedar Rapids to call an election and vote on\r\nthe question of issuing bonds to aid in the construction of said\r\nbridge. This petition was signed by S. C. Bever, one of the early\r\nbankers, and by more than fifty citizens wanting a bridge located at\r\nwhat is now First avenue, asking that the city vote bonds to the extent\r\nof $6,000, promising that the citizens would guarantee the balance for\r\nthe erection of a bridge.\r\n\r\nAnother petition was signed by John F. Ely and about one hundred other\r\ncitizens all interested in locating the bridge at the foot of Park\r\navenue, now Third avenue. These gentlemen asked for the issuance of\r\n$12,000 worth of city bonds, and were willing to guarantee any\r\nadditional sum necessary over and above the amount appropriated by the\r\ncounty and city, which they were to raise by private subscription.\r\nThus, there were two factions within the city, one working against the\r\nother in the matter of the location of the bridge. These factions were\r\ncomposed, of course, of people who were interested in the location at a\r\npoint that would be most advantageous to their private interests.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1870-71 it was very cold and severe until in March\r\nwhen it became suddenly warm. Heavy rains followed and the river on or\r\nabout the first of March was very high and the ice commenced to move\r\nout. Large quantities of ice came rolling and surging down the stream\r\nand carried everything down the river. In a few days the toll bridge at\r\nFirst avenue went down, struck by one of the ice floes which made it\r\ncollapse. The Bourne saw mill also became a total wreck, and more or\r\nless damage was done to all the mills along the river. On account of\r\nthe disaster to the toll bridge all communication with Kingston was cut\r\noff and it became necessary to do something at once.\r\n\r\nThe city council was called together and the mayor called for an\r\nelection. In this council sat J. J. Snouffer, Dr. Mansfield, Stephens,\r\nC. C. Cook, David Denlinger, E. S. Hill, James Bell, and E. Robbins,\r\nwith Mayor Thomas Z. Cook. The city voted bonds to the extent of\r\n$12,000 by a majority vote of 483 for and 83 against the bond\r\nproposition. All this time E. Robbins, one of the aldermen, operated a\r\nsmall boat called the \"Aurora,\" which had previously been used between\r\nthis point and Vinton, as a ferry boat above the dam. It was so\r\narranged that eight teams could cross at the same time.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Keech & Co. established a ferry boat that was\r\noperated by horse power attached to a cable stretched across the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUDGE N. M. HUBBARD]\r\n\r\nThe two men having the most to do with the building of this bridge were\r\nWilliam Ure, a member of the board of supervisors, from Scotch Grove,\r\nand William Richmond, a part of the city council, who had charge of the\r\nentire work. These men devoted a great deal of their time in helping\r\nalong the speedy construction of the bridge. The contract for the\r\nsuperstructure was let in April to Messrs. O'Hanlan and O'Hara at a\r\ncost of $22,000.00. The contract provided that the work should be done\r\nwithin ninety days from April 15th. The bridge proper was erected by\r\nthe Canton Bridge Company, of Canton, Ohio, and cost about $20,000\r\nfor the abutment and piers. The other necessary masonry work made a\r\ntotal cost of $42,000. The bridge fund consisted of the following\r\namounts: The county expended $15,000; city bonds, $12,000;\r\nsubscriptions paid, about $16,000.\r\n\r\nFor many years this bridge was considered as a county bridge and all\r\nmoneys used for repairs were paid from the county bridge fund; later it\r\nwas looked upon as a city bridge, and repairs, etc., were paid for out\r\nof the city treasury. This bridge was completed August 15th and a\r\ncelebration was had. It is still used and the bonds have long since\r\nbeen paid.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1874 the board of supervisors appropriated $8,000 for\r\nthe B avenue bridge and the citizens subscribed $22,000, of which sum\r\nN. B. Brown subscribed $5,000, George Greene $4,000, William Greene\r\n$4,000, Higley estate $2,000. A contract was let for the bridge in\r\nSeptember, 1874, in the amount of $28,500; other additions were made,\r\nmaking the bridge cost about $32,000.\r\n\r\nFourteenth avenue bridge, known as the James street bridge, was begun\r\nin August, 1875, and completed in December of the same year at a total\r\ncost of $27,000. The county appropriated for this bridge $11,500, the\r\ncity $6,000, and the property owners paid $9,500, T. M. Sinclair paying\r\nthe largest amount.\r\n\r\nThe First avenue bridge was constructed in 1884 at a cost of about\r\n$25,000, the bridge being opened for traffic in November, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe Second avenue bridge, being a cement bridge with railings, cost\r\nabout $110,000, and was opened for traffic in December, 1905.\r\n\r\nThe new Fourteenth avenue, or James street, bridge was commenced by the\r\nUnion Construction Company in 1909, and completed in the spring of 1910\r\nat a cost of about $80,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY STEAMBOATING ON THE CEDAR\r\n\r\nThe following account of some early steamboating adventures on the\r\nCedar river is from the pen of B. L. Wick, and is taken from the first\r\nvolume of the _Proceedings_ of the Historical Society of Linn county.\r\nIt is of interest.\r\n\r\nThe subject matter of steamboating on the Cedar will scarcely attract\r\nany attention today and means only a pleasure jaunt with more or less\r\ninconvenience among sandbars on the upper river. However, historically\r\nspeaking, steamboating on this river was an epoch-making period for\r\nthis section of the country, and the prosperity of our city was due in\r\na large measure, to our dam, our grist, saw and woolen mills; and to\r\nour steamboat traffic. These industries made Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the history of a town is frequently the history\r\nof a great river. This is true of nearly all the great European cities\r\nand is equally true of the great marts of commerce in this country. The\r\ngreat Father of Waters has, however, played an important part in the\r\ndevelopment of the middle west, of which great body of water the Red\r\nCedar is one of its many tributaries. It has been stated that this\r\ngreat river system has 16,000 miles of navigable waters, and it is\r\nfurther the river along whose banks at least three of the European\r\npowers have contested for the extension of territory. I shall leave\r\nthis discussion out of the question, and confine myself to one of its\r\nmany branches--the Red Cedar.\r\n\r\nIt was not till August 7, 1807, that Robert Fulton propelled the\r\nClermont up the Hudson by means of steam navigation at the rate of five\r\nmiles an hour, and solved forever, the great question of water\r\nnavigation. It was not long till the inventor and his friend,\r\nLivingston, extended their operations to the great west, and began\r\nbuilding steamboats at Pittsburg, and on December 6, 1812, the\r\n\"Orleans\" of 400 tons burden, was the first steamer which made the trip\r\nto New Orleans, and thus opened up the newly acquired possessions. This\r\nboat was commanded by W. I. Roosevelt, a sturdy ancestor of a worthy\r\ndescendant.\r\n\r\nPrior to this time the products of the great West had been transported\r\nby means of rafts and flat boats, both slow and dangerous. Now river\r\ntrade could be carried on up as well as down the river, and in what was\r\nthen considered very quick time.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1819, Capt. Nelson was the first to propel a steamer,\r\n\"The Independence,\" up the Mississippi river from St. Louis. It was not\r\ntill 1825, according to an old pioneer, Dr. Isaac Galland, that Capt.\r\nJames White, commanding the steamer \"Mandan,\" passed the rapids at\r\nKeokuk.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, Col. George Davenport, the founder of the town which bears his\r\nname, explored the Red Cedar as far as Rock creek, and at this place\r\nestablished a trading post with the Indians, which continued for four\r\nyears. This is the first navigation of this river by the whites on\r\nrecord. The first steamboat on the Des Moines river, of which we have\r\nany knowledge, was in 1837, which arrived as far as Keosauqua. The\r\nfirst keel boat was owned by Capt. Cash, and came up in the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the settlers of the territory early began to encourage\r\nsteamboat traffic with the world. On the 12th of January, 1839, the\r\nlegislature of Iowa Territory empowered a company to incorporate in the\r\namount of $200,000, in order to build a slack water canal from the\r\nCedar river to the Mississippi by way of Rock creek. An act was also\r\npassed for the inspection of steamboats, boilers, etc., at this\r\nsession. Congress on November 6, 1846, for the purposes of improving\r\nthe river traffic, granted certain lands to the Territory of Iowa, to\r\naid in the improving of the Des Moines river for the purpose of\r\nnavigation. Even the other day a large appropriation was granted for\r\nthe erection of locks and a canal at the Keokuk rapids on the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cedar river is about 248 miles long and is comparatively free\r\nfrom any rapids as far as this city, and hence, was early looked upon\r\nas one of the most favored rivers for steamboat navigation. The Iowa,\r\ninto which the Cedar empties, is about 240 miles in length, and not so\r\nfavorable for navigation.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Linn county was created by an act of the\r\nlegislature of Wisconsin territory, and approved December 21, 1837; and\r\nthe spot which our city now covers, was settled the following spring,\r\nby Osgood Shepherd and William Stone, soon followed by Robert Ellis,\r\nPhilip Hull, the Listebargers, Thos. Gainer and David King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEWS ALONG THE CEDAR RIVER]\r\n\r\nOne cannot speak of steamboating without mentioning Robert Ellis, our\r\nrespected pioneer who landed on the present confines of our city May 8,\r\n1838, and found only one shanty inhabited, which was on the present\r\nlocation of the T. M. Sinclair packing house, and was owned by Philip\r\nHull; the other hut was built near the Cooper mills and was then vacant\r\nas the owner, Osgood Shepherd, had gone east for his family. Mr. Ellis\r\nlocated on his present farm that summer and obtained a patent for it\r\nfrom President Polk, and he is no doubt one of the very few in this\r\ncounty who hold title direct from the government of this date. Mr.\r\nEllis in the winter of 1846, had three flat boats built at Palo, each\r\nboat being sixty feet long, sixteen feet wide and drawing three feet of\r\nwater when loaded. On these boats he loaded four thousand bushels of\r\nwheat which he consigned to Noble and McCutchins, of Burlington,\r\nmillers of that place. On each boat he had three men and these were\r\nprovided with side oars to be used when they got into bends of the\r\nriver. They started with their cargo the latter part of March and\r\narrived after some trouble at Burlington; when arriving at Burlington\r\nthe firm were in financial trouble and it looked as though the men\r\ncould not get their pay, but it was finally arranged if Mr. Ellis could\r\ntake flour to New Orleans, they could then realize some money and he\r\nwould be paid. They remained here for some little time, and started out\r\nthe three flat boats again, loaded down with flour. They were a long\r\ntime in getting down the stream but kept on paddling when they got fast\r\nin the stumps and otherwise floated down the river. By the latter\r\npart of June they arrived at New Orleans in safety and disposed of\r\nthe flour, but again were unable to realize on the flour as it had been\r\nconsigned to certain brokers and the payments were tied up. They took\r\nin the slave markets and otherwise looked around the great city which\r\nwas now the great emporium of the west and the southwest, and then took\r\nsteamer for Burlington. Arriving at Burlington Mr. Ellis stood no show\r\nof getting his money, but trusted to luck and bought a horse, riding\r\nhorseback from Burlington to Cedar Rapids. Not till that fall did he\r\nrealize anything on this wheat deal, and finally was paid after much\r\ntrouble by the parties, who were not dishonest, but whose property\r\ninterests had been tied up so they were unable to realize on their\r\ngoods sufficiently to pay creditors.\r\n\r\nThe new waterway of Robert Ellis became the subject of conversation for\r\nsome time afterwards, and it inspired others to greater activity. The\r\npeople realized that they must have an outlet, for their produce and\r\ncheapen transportation, if possible. It became the subject of serious\r\nconsideration by the settlers. If this question could be solved, the\r\ngreatness and importance of the city as a commercial center would be\r\nassured. By 1839, keel boats had reached Ivanhoe, and quite a trade was\r\ncarried on at certain seasons of the year, mostly in the spring, and\r\nmuch grain and farm products were taken away in trade for provisions.\r\n\r\nThus Squire Holmes, the Higley Bros., Daniels & Co., and several\r\nothers, from Marion and Cedar Rapids, in the early forties built flat\r\nboats at Westport and Ivanhoe and traded groceries and other articles\r\nthe farmers needed for wheat, pork, and other produce. This stuff was\r\nshipped in the early spring on flat boats. Sheds were also erected so\r\nas to store the grain until such time as the boats could be loaded. Old\r\nHenry Rogers also erected a saw mill and shipped a little lumber down\r\nthe river. It was dangerous and not practical to get the lumber down\r\nstream, and the scheme was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe first large Mississippi steamer, which came as far as our city\r\nlimits, was in the month of August, 1844, called the \"Maid of Iowa,\"\r\nwhen a number of settlers and also a part of Mormons came as\r\nlandseekers.\r\n\r\n\"The first stream boat at Cedar Rapids was the 'Maid of Iowa' commanded\r\nby Capt. Chas. Ross. She landed and cabled to the saw-mill on the 3rd\r\nof August, 1844, just as the sun was setting.\"--Extract from Account\r\nBook kept by N. B. Brown.\r\n\r\nOn this boat was Rev. Isaac Searles, born in 1812, who located in\r\nJohnson county in 1842. He gave the first sermon in true Methodist\r\nfashion from the deck of the steamer, and talked to a large concourse\r\nof people who had assembled from the surrounding country. Each\r\npassenger was offered a lot by the enterprising people of the city. As\r\na result of this steamboat venture, a Methodist church was organized at\r\nthe home of one of the Listebargers. During the next ten years, many\r\nlarge and small Mississippi steamers made the Cedar river points as far\r\nas Cedar Rapids, and quite a trade had been established between St.\r\nLouis, Keokuk, Burlington and this part of the state.\r\n\r\nThe last of the large Mississippi steamers, which made Cedar Rapids,\r\nwas the \"Uncle Tobey,\" of two hundred tons burden, which made her way\r\nup here among the brush and overhanging willows in the spring of 1853,\r\nand remained at the Third avenue landing for several days, at what is\r\nnow the Warfield-Pratt-Howell building. When departing, after taking on\r\na large cargo of grain and produce, she steamed up the river and turned\r\ndown the channel on the west side of May's island. A number of people\r\nare still living who remember this steamer and the shouts and waving of\r\nhandkerchiefs as the steamer glided smoothly down the river and out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Annals of Iowa_, Vol. 5, page 401, I quote the following\r\nshowing the rainfall in this state from 1848 to 1855: \"In 1848, 26\r\ninches; 1849, 49 inches; 1850, 49 inches; 1851, 74-1/2, inches; 1852,\r\n49 inches; 1853, 45 inches; 1854, 23 inches and in 1855, 28 inches.\" Up\r\nto 1858, the rainfall was below the average, while during the years\r\nfrom '58 to '59, it was above the average. From the newspapers of that\r\ntime, it seems that there were a great many floods during the summer\r\nmonths, so that steamboating was common on all the rivers during the\r\nentire year until frost came.\r\n\r\nThe question has frequently arisen, whether or not the rain fall was\r\ngreater fifty years ago than now, and on the whole, from the old\r\nsettlers, and from reports, as kept, it would seem to be about the\r\nsame. All agree, however, that there was more water in the rivers, and\r\nthey give their reasons as follows: \"That the channel of the river was\r\nmore narrow, and that the rivers were deeper, and free from the mud and\r\nthe sand, which have now accumulated due to the tilling of the soil.\r\nThen the river banks were lined with trees, which protected the water\r\nfrom the rays of the sun, and the sloughs were filled with water all\r\nsummer on account of the high grass, and all these sloughs, creeks,\r\nbayous, supplied the river with water during all seasons of the year,\r\nwhich is now not the case.\" All the water which fell in those days\r\nfound its way into the river, which is not true after the ground became\r\ncultivated to any extent, so that it has been figured out that only\r\nabout a fourth of the water finds its way into the river. This, of\r\ncourse, may be one of the reasons why steamboating was possible fifty\r\nyears ago and is not now.\r\n\r\nOf the many enterprising settlers, who came west to make this city\r\ntheir home, there were a number of enterprising, wide-awake and\r\nindustrious men, who had courage and besides possessed more than\r\nordinary ability along commercial lines. Among these settlers, George\r\nGreene, who was a prime mover in every new enterprise, succeeded in\r\norganizing a company for the building of a steamboat, to be called the\r\n\"Cedar Rapids,\" and to be especially built for navigation upon the Red\r\nCedar river. In this company were, besides Mr. Greene, W. H. Merritt,\r\nthe Daniels family, Dr. J. F. Ely, Dr. S. D. Carpenter and later, W. B.\r\nMack. A contract was entered into with parties at Pittsburg for the\r\nbuilding of a modern steamboat, to be of white oak 155 feet long,\r\nsingle deck, stern wheel, clinker built, to be arranged for freight and\r\npassenger traffic, and to draw the least possible amount of water. The\r\ncontract price for this steamer was $20,000, and it was launched in\r\nJune, 1858, about three months after the contract was let. It was built\r\nat Freedom, Beaver county, Pennsylvania, not far from Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nAs to the subsequent history of this steamer, I shall confine myself to\r\npress notices from the _Cedar Valley Times_, which will give you an\r\nidea of the people and how much interest they took in this vessel,\r\nwhich was to connect them with the outside world. From the issue of\r\nJuly 8th, I find the following: \"News has arrived that the 'Cedar\r\nRapids' left Pittsburg July 1st, with 100 tons of freight.\" From the\r\nissue of July 22nd: \"The 'Cedar Rapids' arrived from Pittsburg in three\r\nweeks, and is around at the dock at Market St. Roman candles were sent\r\nup from her decks when she arrived, and the crowd upon the shores\r\nsaluted her with renewed cheers and with a firing of cannons; below is\r\nher Log: 'Left Pittsburg July 1st, at dark. At Cincinnati the 5th; at\r\nLouisville the 8th; arrived at St. Louis the 12th; left the 15th;\r\narrived at the mouth of the Iowa river at 11 o'clock, and took in tow,\r\n60,000 feet of lumber; five feet of water in the channel up to the\r\nmouth of the Cedar river. Arrived at Moscow Friday evening. Consignees,\r\nWilliam Greene, W. B. Mack, H. C. Camp, groceries; L. Daniels, R. C.\r\nRock, Greene and Hay, hardware; W. W. Smith, O. O. Stanchfield,\r\nlumber.\" The article further goes on describing the steamer as follows:\r\n\"She is 155 feet long, 26 feet wide, and three feet in the hold. She is\r\na stern wheel, 14 feet in diameter, 18 feet long, buckets being 15\r\ninches wide. She is provided with a decker or smaller engine for\r\nsupplying the boiler with water, also with a smaller engine for\r\nhoisting freight out of the hold. All four engines are separate\r\nmachines. She is also supplied with appliances, such as water gauge,\r\ntwo Evans safety guides, one on each engine, life preservers, fire hose\r\nand force pump, in short, everything to make her a first-class\r\npassenger boat. The captain is J. M. Andrews, a gentleman who has had\r\nmuch experience with river navigation; the pilot is Albert Wemper;\r\nmate, T. Risley; engineers, J. P. Fulton and W. M. Hunter; clerks, J.\r\nC. Graves, A. W. Lamb. She had on 300 tons of freight, and drew only\r\nthree feet of water, and when light, draws eleven inches. She had on\r\nboard eighty-four passengers.\"\r\n\r\nThe above description will give you an idea of the first passenger boat\r\nof any note built for traffic in Iowa, and was no doubt at that time,\r\none of the best equipped steamers for passenger and freight traffic\r\nowned exclusively by Iowa men and operated upon Iowa rivers.\r\n\r\nOn this steamer, which made its first trip in 1858, was W. B. Mack, a\r\nperson well known to Cedar Rapids people, and who for half a century,\r\nup to the time of his death a few years ago, had been one of the most\r\nactive business men of our city, and in an early day did much in the\r\neast in securing funds from the rich in various investments in this\r\ncity. Mr. Mack had come to this city in March of this year, at the\r\nsolicitation of Greene and Merritt, and he entered into a partnership\r\nrelation with said men in the banking business. He early saw the\r\nopportunity for Cedar Rapids as a wholesale center, and purchased stock\r\nin the steam ship company, went east in June, purchased a stock of\r\ngroceries in New York City, had them transported by rail to Pittsburg,\r\nand personally saw that they were properly stored on the \"Cedar\r\nRapids.\" On the route he made a purchase of a considerable cargo of\r\nKenawha salt. All of which were shipped to Cedar Rapids, and was the\r\nfirst exclusive wholesale stock of groceries in this city. This had an\r\neffect of reducing the price of salt from $5 per barrel, to one-half,\r\nand it had the further effect of reducing the price of nearly every\r\ncommodity, so that Cedar Rapids, on account of its transportation\r\nfacilities, became known as a cheap trading center, and I believe has\r\nretained that reputation up to the present time.\r\n\r\nOn this first trip of the \"Cedar Rapids,\" came as a passenger from\r\nPittsburg, Susan H. Greene, better known to you, as Mrs. A. S. Belt. If\r\nwe could only have the impression of what this seventeen-year-old young\r\nlady saw on this trip from Pittsburg to Cedar Rapids, in the '50s,\r\nalong this historic waterway, we should undoubtedly have at least a\r\nchapter of the history of the country and of the life of the people as\r\nshe observed it, and it would no doubt make a valuable addition to the\r\nhistory of this county.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cedar Rapids\" made in all, twelve trips during the season, to St.\r\nLouis, stopping at every point along the way to pick up cargo or\r\npassengers. In this respect, the captain was much like President\r\nStickney, of the Great Western, who replied to the manager of an\r\nelectric road the other day, wanting certain traffic relations\r\nestablished, that he would stop for a farm wagon, providing there was\r\nanything in it. Of the Cedar Rapids business men, who, during this time\r\nreceived large shipments of goods from time to time, I note the\r\nfollowing: A. C. Keyes, J. S. Cook, A. H. Atwell, H. C. Camp, H. G.\r\nAngle, W. W. Smith Bros., Stanchfield, Taylor, Greene, and W. B. Mack.\r\n\r\nFrom the issue of July 29th, I find the following: \"The 'Cedar Rapids'\r\nleft for St. Louis yesterday, and had in tow, a barge loaded with 1,138\r\nsacks of oats, 736 sacks of wheat, some corn and 938 barrels of flour.\r\nAt Rochester it will take on 200 barrels of flour. It had besides\r\ntwenty passengers. It was frequently difficult to get under the bridge\r\nat Moscow, so a quantity of sand was taken on board at Cedar Rapids to\r\nweigh the steamer down sufficiently to get under the bridge, when the\r\nweight of the cargo was not sufficient.\" On October 14th, the newspaper\r\nagain mentioned the steamer having arrived from St. Louis with a good\r\ncargo, the bulk of which was 45,000 feet of lumber, consigned to O. O.\r\nStanchfield and Gordon & Enos, the captain further reports low water\r\nand numerous sand-bars.\r\n\r\nThe steamer seems to have run until about the middle of November, when\r\nshe was laid up at St. Louis, and was expected to have gone into winter\r\ntrade on the Red river. Dr. S. D. Carpenter and G. W. Hollet having\r\ngone to New Orleans to make the arrangements. The newspaper for\r\nDecember speaks of the parties having returned unable to book the\r\nsteamer for the winter trade on the Red river, as she was not\r\nconstructed properly for Southern trade.\r\n\r\nEarly in March of the following year the whistle of the \"Cedar Rapids\"\r\nagain greeted the denizens of this city, bringing a large cargo of\r\nfreight, leaving again on the 14th with 4,300 bushels of grain and\r\nsixteen passengers. On this trip was one of our honored townsmen,\r\nGeorge Haman, who had come from Mifflin county, Pennsylvania, two years\r\npreviously, and who now was on his way to St. Louis to buy his first\r\nstock of drugs. He returned in about ten days with a well selected\r\nstock, and has been in active business in the same location ever since.\r\nThe officers this year were captain, B. Tay; clerk, G. W. Hollet, mate,\r\nT. G. Isherwood, and pilot, Merrit. Mr. Haman speaks in glowing terms\r\nof the fine treatment received while on board, of the luxurious\r\nstaterooms and of the magnificent table which was fit for a king. On\r\none of these trips certain machinery was broken at Rochester, and it\r\nwas thought that they had to go afoot to Muscatine to make the repairs\r\nbefore the steamer could proceed further. A village blacksmith by the\r\nname of Jim Grant, a cousin of the general, after looking over the\r\nbroken piston rods, said in his laconic way, \"I'd rather pound away\r\nhere all summer, than have a man walk to Muscatine and back,\" and he\r\nwas as good as his word, for in the morning he had the damage repaired\r\nand received a good day's wages and three cheers from the crew and the\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nIn the issue of May 5th, the paper mentioned the steamer \"Cedar Rapids\"\r\nas departing from this city for Burlington with 9,000 bushels of grain\r\nwith A. W. Lamb as captain. This was the last trip the \"Cedar Rapids\"\r\nmade on Cedar river water, as by the issue of May 19th the paper speaks\r\nof the \"Cedar Rapids\" sinking another steamer near Burlington. Mr.\r\nIsherwood tells me, that the steamer which was sunk was called the\r\n\"Canton\" and owned by John Roads of Savannah, Ill. The accident was due\r\nto a mistake of signals. The injured parties held the \"Cedar Rapids\"\r\nand a long litigation ensued, which was a severe blow to the\r\nstockholders, who lost their steamer. The sound of the whistle of the\r\n\"Cedar Rapids\" was never heard again, and it closes the chapter as far\r\nas steam boating below the dam is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe day of steamboating was about over. A new method of transportation\r\nwas devised, and millions of dollars which had been spent by the state\r\nand by the nation was now of but little account, and the grants of land\r\nwhich had been made in order to improve the navigation of our river,\r\nwas now changed, and given in the extension of railroads. June 15,\r\n1859, is the great gala day of Cedar Rapids, for it is on this day that\r\nthe last rail was laid which connected us with Chicago, and the far\r\nEast, and the celebration of this occasion is the most noted that we\r\nhave ever had up to the present time. There were orators from the East,\r\nfrom the South and from the North, and the news of this celebration was\r\nspread broadcast over the land and it seemed to have been of such a\r\nflowery kind that it caused the waters of the Cedar to flow backwards,\r\nand only Elias Doty has ever since that time succeeded in piloting a\r\nsteamboat on the murky waters of the Cedar, as far as Rochester.\r\n\r\nAs I have stated before, the dam across the Cedar was erected in 1842,\r\nalthough Mrs. John F. Ely says the dam was never completed, and her\r\nhusband constantly spent large sums of money to keep it up, and it was\r\nnot long till quite a traffic was going on above the dam as far as\r\nCedar Falls. Early in 1858, T. G. Isherwood came from Brownsville,\r\nPennsylvania, the son of a boat builder, and he set to work to build\r\nthe first boat of any size for river traffic. It was built for Freeman\r\nSmith & Co., and nearly all the lumber was sawed by Snouffer & Watrous\r\nand came out of Bever Park. It made its trial trip on September 30,\r\n1858. It was a stern wheeler, single deck, 125 feet long, 125 tons\r\nburden, called the \"Export.\" From the paper of October 7, I quote the\r\nfollowing: \"The new steamer 'Export' made her trial trip up the river\r\nlast Friday, having on board some 70 or 80 of our citizens. She\r\nperformed well, and all on board were delighted with the trip. We are\r\nhappy to know that the whole community unite in awarding the owners,\r\nFreeman Smith &. Co., much praise. The list of officers are as follows:\r\nMaster, Freeman Smith, Jr.; clerk, S. D. McCaulley; engineer, Tom\r\nStanley; mate, Tom G. Isherwood.\" The paper for the next few weeks\r\nspeaks in glowing terms of the \"Export\" and what a trade the merchants\r\nof this city have worked up with the towns along the river. That the\r\nboat makes the distance by river from Waterloo in fourteen hours and\r\nfrom Vinton, in five hours. The Waverly _Republican_, then edited by\r\nour townsman, J. O. Stewart, asks the people of Waverly and the\r\nsurrounding country to obtain their goods by way of Cedar Rapids, as\r\nthe cheapest and quickest method by which to get goods into that region\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Isherwood speaks of the boat doing a big business, both in freight\r\nand passenger traffic, and that on the whole he did a paying business\r\nfor the short time it was in service. On this first trip, was enrolled\r\nas a member of the crew, George Horridge, a young tinner, who had\r\nrecently come from the east, and who is now well and favorably known as\r\na banker and capitalist at Vinton. Marion Evans, now mayor of said\r\ntown, tells me of running a mile and a half to the river to see this\r\nfirst steamer, and when he saw the smoke from the smoke-stack he hid\r\nbehind the hazelbrush thinking of the eruption of Vesuvius. The paper\r\nof October 21st speaks of a picnic party having chartered the boat and\r\ngone up the river, and among the names of those well and favorably\r\nknown to most of you, at least by name, I shall mention a few: George\r\nGreene, Dr. S. D. Carpenter, Dr. Lyon, J. F. Ely, J. S. Cook, Rev.\r\nDurley and ladies. During the winter the \"Export\" was sold to J. J.\r\nSnouffer and W. D. Watrous. It was remodeled, called the \"Blackhawk,\"\r\nand on March 16th made its first trip to Waterloo, with J. J. Snouffer\r\nas captain and George A. Ohler as chief carpenter. Arriving at Vinton,\r\nthey were unable to get under the bridge, and threatened to destroy it.\r\nA council of war was held and it was finally decided to elevate one\r\nspan of the bridge about four feet, and Ohler superintended the work.\r\nMr. Snouffer tells me that the biggest business the steamer did was on\r\nJune 15th, when he carried 107 passengers at $5.00 a head for round\r\ntrip for the Cedar Rapids celebration, including board and lodging. He\r\nmade in all, twenty-nine trips, and during this season, free of all\r\nexpenses, netted the owners $2,000. The \"Blackhawk\" as remodeled, was\r\n110 feet long by 19 feet wide, and had two rows of berths on each side,\r\nand accommodated 24 passengers, besides a crew of seven people. It took\r\nfour cords of wood per trip. The table of distances by river compiled\r\nby the pilot on the \"Blackhawk\" is as follows: Palo, 14-1/2 miles;\r\nBenton City, 42 miles; Vinton, 50 miles; La Porte, 82 miles, and\r\nWaterloo, 113 miles. It was sold to Burley & Durlin, and the owners\r\naccepted one-half of the purchase price in land. The cash was never\r\npaid, and attachment was gotten out for labor claims and the boat was\r\nsold for $19.00. It was sold to a preacher, at Western, who threw up\r\nthe deal, and again the boat was sold to N. B. Brown and John Curliss,\r\nthe entire purchase price being paid in woolen goods. On account of dry\r\nseason, the boat was sent south and was sold by the owners to the\r\ngovernment for $6,000 during the war, and was used for carrying\r\nprovisions for the soldiers on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. At\r\none time some of the Linn county soldier boys saw the little steamer\r\nmake its way up one of the rivers, and a yell went up for the old\r\n\"Blackhawk.\" The sight of the steamer brought them nearer home.\r\n\r\nOn one of the trips Mr. Snouffer made that summer, the wife of the\r\nfireman, who was acting as maid, was taken ill and the captain sent two\r\ndoctors who were passengers to examine her. After a hurried examination\r\nboth came up very much excited, stating that the patient was suffering\r\nfrom spotted fever and for him to stop the boat that they wanted to\r\nget off at all hazards. Mr. Snouffer thought perhaps of damages and\r\nfinancial loss so he was in no hurry to comply, but took the husband\r\nand went into the small cabin up next to the smoke-stack to investigate\r\nfor himself. There was the woman in great stress of mind and much\r\nworried. He took hold of her hand and tried to rub the spots out and\r\nsure enough it was found that during the night the coloring in the\r\ncotton goods had colored her arms and the headache was no doubt due to\r\nthe stuffy room and extremely warm quarters. It is needless to say that\r\nfor the rest of the trip the doctors were made the butt of ridicule by\r\nthe passengers.\r\n\r\nThe \"Surprise\" freighted between this city and Vinton in '63 and the\r\nnext steamer was known as the \"Nettie Munn,\" being a stern wheeler 70\r\nfeet long and 12 feet wide, and was brought here from Wisconsin by Mr.\r\nPassmore in 1866, and was blown up at Kelsey's landing the following\r\nyear. Another steamer was built by E. Robins and used as a ferry boat,\r\nand in the wool and lime trade, but was never fully equipped, and was\r\nsunk many years ago. The \"Carrie Wallace\" was built by W. G. Brock in\r\nabout 1870; was 16×40, a stern wheeler without state rooms, and was\r\nused mostly to tow barges, excursion steamers, etc., and was blown up\r\nabout 1879-80. The \"Kitty Clyde\" was run awhile and abandoned. John\r\nKozlovsky built the \"Rose\" in the early days, and after a steamboat\r\nventure on the river, was minus several thousand dollars, but had\r\ngained a heap of experience in the meantime. The boiler of the \"Rose\"\r\nwas shipped to Solon to be placed in the grist mill, and the engine was\r\nsent to Spirit Lake, while Captain Elias Doty bought the hull for a\r\nmere song in 1884. In this \"Rose\" hull, Capt. Doty installed the\r\nboilers of an abandoned steamer, the \"Carrie Wallace,\" and into it he\r\nalso installed the engine of an old freighter, called \"General Weaver.\"\r\nThis combination, Doty called the \"Climax.\" A stock company was\r\norganized with the amount of $1,000 and is the only stock known on\r\nrecord which never at any time went below par. Doty put in $600, and\r\nhis Cedar Rapids friends the balance. He says that he was not out any\r\ninterest as he had the money in the bank when he started. He was out\r\nonly his time, but he didn't count that much, as he had all the time\r\nthere was, and a whole lot of fun in the bargain. It is true, he lost\r\nthe principal, but then the captain consoles himself with the fact that\r\nhe might have lost that anyway. The \"Climax\" was not the only boat the\r\n\"Governor\" ran, for a number of years he had a side wheeler called the\r\n\"Khedive\" and another boat named after his patron saint of greenback\r\ndays and called the \"General Weaver.\" After his exploits upon the river\r\nthe captain, like the snail, carried his house with him, and for a\r\nnumber of years, one of the hulls of one of his stranded boats is said\r\nto have served him as a photograph gallery.\r\n\r\nThere had been more or less trouble growing out of the fact that this\r\nriver and the Iowa, which seems to have been known as one stream, were\r\nnavigable, as the people preferred bridges and dams to open river\r\nfronts. In an Act of Congress passed May 6, 1870, the following\r\nappears: \"That so much of the same river as lies north of the town of\r\nWapello be and the same is hereby declared not a navigable stream.\"\r\nAnother act was passed on the 18th day of August, 1894, to the effect\r\nthat \"so much of the same river as lies between the town of\r\nToolsborough and Wapello in Louisa county, Iowa, shall not be deemed a\r\nnavigable stream, but dams and bridges may be constructed across it.\"\r\nThus it would seem that the Iowa and Red Cedar rivers for nearly the\r\nentire distance in Iowa are not navigable so far as Congress has the\r\nright and power to enact such laws, which of course merely refer to\r\nwhether or not such streams may be used for other purposes than\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the story of steamboating is a history of a struggle, which\r\nbegan under auspicious circumstances, and ended in financial failure,\r\nbut for all that, it made a new Cedar Rapids, and we perhaps today, are\r\nprofiting by the failures of half a century ago, for it shows what\r\nenergy and public spirit its first citizens had, which left an\r\nimpression upon the community and upon the state. We must bear in mind,\r\nthat Cedar Rapids had only 2,000 people and the county less than\r\n18,000, when these enterprising men of energy, perseverance and thrift\r\nput $20,000 into a hazardous undertaking, and even presented passengers\r\nand crew with corner lots on arrival.\r\n\r\nWell might the first passenger have said, when he stepped off the\r\nsteamboat landing, at Third avenue, much like Moore said of Washington\r\na hundred years ago,\r\n\r\n     \"An embryo capital where fancy sees,\r\n     Squares in morasses and obelisks in trees,\"\r\n\r\nbut the observing traveler, amid these crude surroundings, must have\r\nbeen alive to new impressions, for Cedar Rapids was a thrifty place,\r\neven then, where the new man was a pilot on a boat today, and a banker\r\ntomorrow, and although the waters of the Cedar henceforth ran quietly\r\nby, unhindered by paddle or screw, railroad building claimed the\r\nattention of its people, and they became equally at home on land, as\r\nthey had been on water. Just the other day I asked one of your old\r\nsettlers why they could keep up several newspapers in that day, really\r\nbefore they had a postoffice. The venerable ex-postmaster replied with\r\nfire in his eye, \"Why, heavens sakes my man, it took three newspapers\r\nto keep up the town.\"\r\n\r\nI have attempted to give you an idea of steamboating on the Red Cedar.\r\nI have omitted much, and can only say in the words of the old miller,\r\nthat he sees not all the water that goes by his mill. Neither have I\r\nmentioned all the steamboat ventures on the beautiful Cedar.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is of interest to note a report made by B. L.\r\nWick to Lew W. Anderson, chairman of the River Front Improvement\r\nCommission of Cedar Rapids, under date of May 8, 1909, which report was\r\nlater submitted to the authorities at Washington, and an appropriation\r\nmade for a survey of the Cedar. The survey was made in 1909, and report\r\nsubmitted that it was not feasible without a large expenditure of money\r\nto make the river navigable except for a short distance from its mouth.\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n     I have been requested to state my views on the\r\n     practicability and the importance of the navigability of the\r\n     Cedar river, and will say that for the past ten years I have\r\n     devoted more or less study to this subject from a historic\r\n     standpoint, and will herewith give you my views. I believe\r\n     that what you want more than anything else is whether or not\r\n     the Cedar river has been navigated formerly, whether or not\r\n     the rainfall is the same as it used to be, and whether or\r\n     not there is at present a demand for the opening of this\r\n     river as a water way for transportation purposes.\r\n\r\n     Historically speaking, traffic on the Cedar river was an\r\n     epoch making period of this section of the country in the\r\n     early pioneer days, and the prosperity of Cedar Rapids and\r\n     other cities was due in a large measure to the river traffic\r\n     which in those days made, at least, this city what it later\r\n     became.\r\n\r\n     The first notice we have of a white man exploring what is\r\n     known as the \"Red Cedar River\" was by Col. George Davenport\r\n     as early as 1831 when he established a trading post, at Rock\r\n     Creek. The first steamboating on the Des Moines river was\r\n     about in 1837, and from this time on the Des Moines, the\r\n     Iowa and Red Cedar became the inland water ways by which\r\n     grain was exported and freight was brought up from the\r\n     cities on the Mississippi river. As early as 1839 the\r\n     legislature of Iowa territory empowered a company to\r\n     incorporate in the amount of $200,000.00 to build a slack\r\n     water canal from the Cedar river to the Mississippi river by\r\n     way of what is known as \"Rock Creek,\" and while this project\r\n     did not come to anything, it shows that the people of this\r\n     early day believed in a public water way in order to come in\r\n     contact with the towns along the river further up.\r\n\r\n     The Red Cedar river is about 248 miles long and is\r\n     comparatively free from any rapids as far as Cedar Rapids,\r\n     and hence was early looked upon as one of the most favored\r\n     rivers for steam boat navigation. The Iowa river, into which\r\n     the Cedar river empties, is about 240 miles in length and is\r\n     not so favorable for navigation. One of the early settlers\r\n     who first saw the use of this inland water way was Robert\r\n     Ellis, who came to these parts in 1838 and who is still\r\n     living, and who, as early as 1846, caused three flat boats\r\n     to be built, each boat being about sixty feet in length,\r\n     sixteen feet in width and only drew three feet of water when\r\n     loaded. On these boats he loaded 4,000 bushels of wheat\r\n     consigned to certain millers at Burlington; at Burlington he\r\n     unloaded the wheat and loaded the same boats with a cargo of\r\n     flour which was duly taken to New Orleans. From this time on\r\n     much wheat, corn, bacon, and other articles were shipped\r\n     from Cedar Rapids to Burlington, Keokuk, St. Louis, and\r\n     other places on the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n     It is also true that Mr. Haman, one of the oldest druggists\r\n     of this city, went to St. Louis for his first stock of drugs\r\n     and these were brought back by water.\r\n\r\n     W. B. Mack, one of the early settlers, and one of the first\r\n     wholesale grocers, secured a cargo of salt in Ohio, which\r\n     was duly freighted to Cedar Rapids and caused a decline in\r\n     the price of this commodity in the amount of $5.00 a barrel.\r\n\r\n     It is known that as early as 1839 keel boats had reached\r\n     Ivanhoe, and quite a trade was carried on at certain seasons\r\n     of the year. The first Mississippi steamer which came as far\r\n     as our city limits was in the month of June, 1846, called\r\n     \"The Maid of Iowa,\" when a number of settlers came this way\r\n     as land seekers and at a time when each passenger was\r\n     offered a lot by the enterprising people of this city.\r\n     During the next ten years many large and many small steamers\r\n     made the Cedar river towns as far as Cedar Rapids, and quite\r\n     a trade had been established between St. Louis, Keokuk,\r\n     Burlington, and other cities. One of the large Mississippi\r\n     steamers of 200 tons burden was \"The Uncle Tobey,\" which\r\n     made her way up here among the brush and hanging willows in\r\n     the spring of 1853, having on board a large cargo of\r\n     freight.\r\n\r\n     To show how much importance the river was to the early\r\n     settlers it might be well to state that in the fifties--in\r\n     about 1857--a contract was entered into for the building of\r\n     a steamer about 155 feet long, single deck, stern wheel,\r\n     clinker built, to be arranged for freight and passenger\r\n     traffic and to draw the least possible amount of water. The\r\n     contract price of this steamer was $20,000.00, and it was\r\n     launched in June, 1858, and was put into service, arriving\r\n     at Cedar Rapids July 22, having arrived from Pittsburg in\r\n     three weeks, stopping at all the cities along the way; this\r\n     boat had on board about three hundred tons of freight, drew\r\n     only three feet of water, and had on board nearly one\r\n     hundred passengers. This was, undoubtedly, the best built\r\n     passenger and freight boat put on Iowa rivers at that time;\r\n     during that season this boat made in all twelve trips. On\r\n     the first trip down stream on July 29, of that year, the\r\n     papers show that she was loaded down and had in tow a barge\r\n     loaded with 1,138 sacks of oats, 736 sacks of wheat, some\r\n     corn, and nearly 1,000 barrels of flour. On one of the trips\r\n     in October up stream this boat had on board 45,000 feet of\r\n     lumber; in the following summer this boat got into a\r\n     collision with another steamer on the Mississippi, and on\r\n     account of a lawsuit the boat was tied up by litigation.\r\n\r\n     For a number of years a profitable steamboat business was\r\n     carried on in the spring of the year above the dam between\r\n     Cedar Rapids, Vinton, Waterloo and other places. The early\r\n     settlers all agree that navigation was possible in those\r\n     days and profitable as well. It was just at this time when\r\n     steamboating became certain and settled that the railroad\r\n     entered Cedar Rapids in June, 1859, and from that time every\r\n     enterprise which was started was in the line of railway\r\n     extension as well as transportation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARK VIEWS IN CEDAR RAPIDS]\r\n\r\n     As to the rain fall, it seems that there has not been much\r\n     difference between the rains of sixty years ago and now. I\r\n     collected the following from the _Annals of Iowa_, Volume 5,\r\n     page 401, being the rain fall from 1848 to 1855.\r\n\r\n     In 1848, 26 inches; 1849, 49 inches; 1850, 49 inches; 1851,\r\n     71 inches; 1852, 49 inches; 1853, 45 inches; 1854, 23\r\n     inches; 1855, 28 inches.\r\n\r\n     From this the average rain fall of Iowa, I believe, is\r\n     estimated at about 33 inches. It would appear from 1858 the\r\n     rain fall was below the average, while during the years up\r\n     to 1858 the rain fall was above the average. From the\r\n     newspapers that I have consulted in regard to the rain fall\r\n     during these years it seemed that there were a good many\r\n     floods during the summer months so that the steamboating was\r\n     good until about November, when the boats were taken down\r\n     south for winter traffic on the southern rivers. As to the\r\n     rain fall, I have further investigated among the old\r\n     settlers, and from reports which were kept, it seems that\r\n     there is not very much difference in the rain fall now and\r\n     fifty years ago; however, there is this difference, which\r\n     all agree on, that the channel of the river was more narrow\r\n     and that the river was deeper and free from mud and sand,\r\n     which has now accumulated due to the tilling of the soil.\r\n     The river banks were lined with trees which protected the\r\n     water from the rays of the sun, and the sloughs were filled\r\n     with water all summer on account of the high grass, and\r\n     these grasses and sloughs supplied the river with water more\r\n     so then than now, as more of it evaporated on account of the\r\n     tilling of soil and on account of the cutting of the grass\r\n     than formerly. All the water which fell in those days found\r\n     its way into the river, which is not true after the ground\r\n     became cultivated to any extent, and it may be true that\r\n     only one-fourth of the water which falls now finds its way\r\n     into the river.\r\n\r\n     Another question may arise \"is it practical?\" This is a\r\n     question not easily answered. It is certain that it can not\r\n     be done through private enterprise; if it shall succeed at\r\n     all it must be through state or government aid in part, at\r\n     least. There is no question but what it will be useful, but\r\n     whether or not the expenses would be too great to undertake\r\n     such an enterprise--that remains a debatable question. There\r\n     is water enough in the river, especially by putting in a dam\r\n     at Moscow and by straightening the channel a little, so that\r\n     there will be enough water for the number of months during\r\n     the year to haul much of our heavy freight, and, if\r\n     necessary, these products could be stored further along the\r\n     river until such a time as it was deemed advisable to sell\r\n     and dispose of the same. Heavy freight requires slow transit\r\n     and a cheap rate, and such can as well go by water as by\r\n     rail. For this reason it would be possible to ship by water,\r\n     grain, cereals, as well as cattle, and there would be a\r\n     great saving to the farmers of this part of Iowa.\r\n\r\n     A conservative estimate of freight paid in Cedar Rapids\r\n     during the past year is no less than $2,500,000.00, all of\r\n     which is paid to five railroads which have connecting lines\r\n     in this city. It is also estimated, and I have been told on\r\n     good authority, that during October, 1908, the tonnage\r\n     receipts in this city were as follows for the Rock Island\r\n     railroad:\r\n\r\n          Live stock         4,638,800 pounds\r\n          Coal              14,659,303 pounds\r\n          Brick                383,900 pounds\r\n          Stone              1,603,200 pounds\r\n\r\n     These are only a few of the larger items and there are a\r\n     great many more of nearly equal importance with those cited\r\n     above. There has also been shipped out in farm and dairy\r\n     products for the year ending 1908 from\r\n\r\n          Linn county        1,980,218 pounds\r\n          Cedar county         733,708 pounds\r\n          Benton county        451,297 pounds\r\n          Black Hawk county        1,032,444 pounds\r\n          Buchanan county          1,980,218 pounds\r\n\r\n     These are a few of the items from the counties which are\r\n     tributory to this river.\r\n\r\n     For the year 1907 I will mention the yield of a few cereals\r\n     in counties adjoining the Cedar river, to-wit:\r\n\r\nBuchanan county      1,942,750 bushels corn      1,011,000 bushels oats\r\nBenton county        3,686,100 bushels corn      1,842,800 bushels oats\r\nLinn county          3,851,500 bushels corn      1,166,160 bushels oats\r\nJohnson county       3,415,170 bushels corn      1,231,100 bushels oats\r\nCedar county         3,211,230 bushels corn        804,500 bushels oats\r\n\r\n     Say nothing of hay, potatoes, barley, wheat, rye and other\r\n     products.\r\n\r\n     Such a water course would also offer inducement to\r\n     manufacturing concerns for the manufacture of cereals, etc.,\r\n     which are shipped out in carload lots daily, as well as\r\n     grain which is cleaned here and sent out to other cities.\r\n     This will give you somewhat of an idea, not only of the\r\n     value and productiveness of Iowa soil, but to show the\r\n     chances of such a water way by which freight products could\r\n     be handled at a much lower rate than at present, as we have\r\n     here the same freight rate as they have at Council Bluffs,\r\n     and by this means we would get the Mississippi rate, which\r\n     is much less. Such a water way would open up the heart of\r\n     the corn and oats belt of Iowa and make it possible to get\r\n     the water rate on large shipments of freight. If the\r\n     government is now urging a water way enterprise, surely the\r\n     Cedar river should not be overlooked, for it is a large body\r\n     of water, with a rich adjoining territory, and by government\r\n     promotion could be made the carrier of all our products\r\n     which, as above set out, means millions in bushels annually.\r\n\r\n     It is not likely that the freight shipped into our city\r\n     would come by water, as it is generally of a kind which is\r\n     wanted quickly, but there is no question but that the\r\n     products of our farmers, and all our mills and factories,\r\n     would be sent by water, on account of cheaper rates to\r\n     better markets than now.\r\n\r\n     It is only when I visited other countries and studied\r\n     transportation from cities in England, Holland, Belgium,\r\n     France and Germany that I realized the small rivers of those\r\n     countries which have been used for centuries to such an\r\n     advantage for the carriage of freight. For instance, a river\r\n     of any size is dredged to a certain depth at government\r\n     expense; there is a uniform depth of a little better than\r\n     three feet of water on many of these rivers, and on these\r\n     bodies of water barges of not less than 1,000 tons pass up\r\n     and down loaded with freight. This means cheaper freight\r\n     rates than we have and this in consequence makes products\r\n     cheaper to the consumer and higher for the producer. Canada,\r\n     during the past few years, has spent millions of dollars on\r\n     its rivers and canals, and it is money wisely spent; while\r\n     we have spent little or nothing in any effort to help the\r\n     people in the promotion of water ways, which will be the\r\n     real source of competition in freight rates in the future.\r\n\r\n     I fully believe that the survey of the Cedar should be made,\r\n     and I believe that if such a survey is made that this stream\r\n     will be declared navigable, and that the state or nation\r\n     will step in in order to make definite plans for financing\r\n     this great enterprise for the carrying on of freight\r\n     steamers, carrying cargoes as far as the Mississippi, and I\r\n     believe that enough tariff exists now to warrant such an\r\n     enterprise. The Cedar river is an important factor now for\r\n     the purpose of furnishing power, and should also become a\r\n     factor in transportation as well. This would be the case\r\n     provided the river would be improved as demanded, which\r\n     would result in re-establishing heavy freight traffic by\r\n     water instead of as now wholly by rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n_Banks and Banking in Linn County_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of banking in Cedar Rapids and Linn county may\r\nappropriately be divided into three periods, designated respectively,\r\nFrontier Banking, Country Banking, and City Banking, each possessing\r\ncharacteristics peculiar to itself and expressive of its time.\r\n\r\nFrontier Banking was coincident with the beginning of business in Iowa,\r\nand continuing, covered the pioneer days, prior to the coming of the\r\nrailroad, and its story is most interestingly told in his own words by\r\nDr. S. D. Carpenter, whose youthful activities were a part of that\r\nearly life, and who, in his eightieth year, writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Something over fifty years ago, as I recall the\r\n     circumstance, I was greatly elated when the local printer at\r\n     Cedar Rapids produced a card on which was imprinted\r\n     'Carpenter, Lehman & Co., Bankers.' At an earlier period of\r\n     my life, I had read _Æsop's Fables_, but if I had, the story\r\n     of the Ass who paraded in the Lion's skin did not seem\r\n     applicable, and I mingled boldly with my companions, who,\r\n     with equal effrontery, wore the same apparel. The\r\n     'protoplasm' from which the bankers of that day evoluted was\r\n     plentiful and the environment all that could be desired. In\r\n     a technical sense, it is quite true, there was no necessity\r\n     for a bank and no business for a banker; there being no\r\n     commerce, there were no bills to discount; but nevertheless,\r\n     we established banks and became bankers. This was possible,\r\n     because we had squatted down in the midst of millions of\r\n     acres of a very fertile soil, in a genial and healthy\r\n     climate. The product of land could not be exported, but a\r\n     large immigration was pouring into the country, hungry for\r\n     land and sufficiently numerous to consume all the surplus\r\n     products. Land was the basis of all the live business, and\r\n     the land agent and real estate dealer evoluted naturally\r\n     into a banker. Land warrants took the place of commodities,\r\n     dealers in the east collected them, and sent them to their\r\n     agents in the west, who sold them at a large advance to the\r\n     immigrants for whom they entered the land. The western real\r\n     estate dealer ordinarily did not have capital enough to buy\r\n     the land warrant, but handled it on a commission for his\r\n     eastern correspondent until such time as he could accumulate\r\n     from his profits sufficient cash to buy it outright. The\r\n     price of the land warrant as purchased from the party to\r\n     whom issued, was less than one dollar per acre, and was\r\n     always sold to the buyer who used it at $1.25 per acre, that\r\n     is a profit of at least 25 cents per acre, and with the\r\n     continual increase of immigrants the business became of\r\n     great volume and was correspondingly remunerative. Often the\r\n     purchaser wanted more land than he had cash to pay for; then\r\n     the real estate man sold the warrant at the rate of $1.25\r\n     per acre, took the purchaser's note for the balance at three\r\n     per cent per month interest and held all the land as\r\n     security. At this point, the real estate man became a\r\n     banker. The first real estate firm in Cedar Rapids was that\r\n     of Weare, Finch & Co., consisting of John Weare, Jr., Daniel\r\n     O. Finch, and George Greene. They began business either in\r\n     1850 or 1851. I was offered a one-fourth interest in the\r\n     syndicate for $500.00 and would gladly have taken it, but\r\n     was unable to raise the requisite capital. Although unable\r\n     to break into the crib, like many others, I hung around and\r\n     was able now and then to grab an ear from the overflow. In\r\n     other words, I became a customer of the bank. Being in the\r\n     practise of medicine, I became familiar with all the\r\n     surrounding country. When I discovered a choice location as\r\n     regarded timber, water, etc., I went to the bank, bought a\r\n     land warrant at $1.25 per acre, gave my note at three per\r\n     cent per month, with a cast iron mortgage, and took my\r\n     chances in the hope of selling at an advance before the\r\n     maturity of the note. I was so successful in these ventures\r\n     that I soon abandoned my profession and devoted my whole\r\n     time to real estate. The real estate operator took advantage\r\n     of the fact that many of the immigrants brought money with\r\n     them, which it required time to invest. They had to look up\r\n     locations to enter or to examine tracts which they desired\r\n     to buy at second hand. Meantime, they did not wish to carry\r\n     their money about with them and therefore they deposited it\r\n     in the bank. The trade of the local merchants also\r\n     increased, and they gradually became customers, and from\r\n     these sources came the deposits. The volume of exchange was\r\n     small, but the bank added something to its income by acting\r\n     as agent for the payment of taxes for non-residents. The\r\n     firm of Weare, Finch & Co. soon merged into that of Greene &\r\n     Weare, D. O. Finch removing to Des Moines to establish a\r\n     branch of the same house. Greene & Weare did not long enjoy\r\n     a monopoly at Cedar Rapids. B. S. Bryan, who had been a\r\n     clerk in their house, and had become familiar with the\r\n     business, with a brother-in-law named Ward, from New Jersey,\r\n     opened a rival establishment under the name of Ward & Bryan,\r\n     some time in 1852 or '53. At that time, the immigration was\r\n     so large that both establishments had all the business they\r\n     could manage with their limited capital. It is not probable\r\n     that either concern was very conservative, but the newer\r\n     firm had but little capital, and the members branched out in\r\n     the way of building new residences for themselves, and Bryan\r\n     went so far as to buy a top buggy and a fine horse. This was\r\n     going beyond the limit; the pioneer whose aspirations in the\r\n     way of a pleasure carriage did not extend beyond a two horse\r\n     wagon, became suspicious. Some renewals of paper in Iowa\r\n     City and Davenport were refused them, and they had to close\r\n     their doors. Then ensued a mild financial earthquake, which\r\n     did not affect the town itself, because no one in the town,\r\n     except the merchants, had any money on deposit, and they but\r\n     little, but the sufferers were those who had put their money\r\n     in the bank preparatory to buying land, and the bankers of\r\n     whom they had bought land warrants on credit. Wm. Greene and\r\n     myself, were appointed receivers. The assets amounted to\r\n     about $35,000.00 and the indebtedness to something more. It\r\n     took a year or two to close up the business and there was\r\n     not a very great loss to any one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN AND AROUND MT. VERNON]\r\n\r\n     \"The town had scarcely quieted down from this excitement\r\n     before it was struck by another financial cyclone of an\r\n     entirely different character. We had a mail three times a\r\n     week from Dubuque to Iowa City, the service being performed\r\n     by four horse Concord coaches; it was before the day of the\r\n     express companies. All money and other valuable packages\r\n     came by mail. One day about 9 o'clock in the morning, the\r\n     postmaster from Marion dashed into town at full speed,\r\n     bringing the alarming intelligence that a mail pouch had\r\n     been stolen from the coach in Marion, which had been found\r\n     cut open and rifled and then concealed in some shavings back\r\n     of a carpenter shop, near the hotel where the stage stopped\r\n     to change horses and allow the passengers to breakfast. In\r\n     the sack and near it, concealed in the shavings, were\r\n     letters, and a package of land warrants, amounting to\r\n     several thousand dollars. What was missing was not known.\r\n     The land warrants were addressed to Greene & Weare. A crowd\r\n     gathered about the bank and it soon became known that a\r\n     money package had been in the pouch, but the amount was not\r\n     given. Soon the report spread about that the bank had lost\r\n     five, ten, or twenty thousand dollars, the sum varying\r\n     according to the guessing power of the relator. Immediately\r\n     John Weare and Wm. Greene started post haste to Marion,\r\n     where they found a high state of excitement. The town had\r\n     resolved itself into a committee of 'Sherlock Holmeses,' all\r\n     devoting themselves to detective business. As a starting\r\n     point, they were told that the money consisted of bank\r\n     notes, issued by the Bank of Elgin, Illinois. Suspicion soon\r\n     pointed to a disreputable blacksmith, living in a small\r\n     frame house nearby. The stage had arrived at the hotel just\r\n     before daylight, first driving to the postoffice, where the\r\n     driver thought he had thrown all the sacks from the boot,\r\n     but the small one had escaped his notice. The stage stood in\r\n     front of the hotel and the horses were taken to the stable\r\n     and fresh ones brought to supply their places. While this\r\n     was being done and the passengers being at their breakfast,\r\n     the stage was quite deserted, and it was then, it still\r\n     being dark, that the thief got in his work. The stage\r\n     proceeded on its way, and it was not till the carpenter\r\n     shop, which stood just across the street from the hotel, was\r\n     opened up for work, that a workman discovered the papers\r\n     scattered about and finally the pouch itself. The alarm was\r\n     at once given and the postmaster, as stated, carried the\r\n     news to Cedar Rapids. It was not known that money had been\r\n     stolen till Mr. Weare and Mr. Greene arrived. Soon after\r\n     their arrival it became known that the blacksmith, quite\r\n     early in the day, had been to the town grocery and much to\r\n     the surprise of the grocer, paid up a standing account, and\r\n     bought several dollars' worth of goods, for which he paid\r\n     cash, with bills of the Bank of Elgin. These bills had not\r\n     been in general circulation, and the grocer was making\r\n     inquiries about them, which at once fixed suspicion on the\r\n     blacksmith, who was immediately arrested and a guard placed\r\n     about his house. He was searched, but nothing of an\r\n     incriminating nature found. The house was then thoroughly\r\n     gone over, and a five dollar bill of the Bank of Elgin found\r\n     in the crack in the wall behind a looking glass. The man\r\n     declared his innocence, and the woman said she knew nothing\r\n     about the discovered bill. They had three children, a boy\r\n     about thirteen, another eight, and a younger girl. In\r\n     explanation of the bills paid the grocer, he said a man from\r\n     Illinois, where he had formerly lived, had passed through\r\n     the town the day before, and had paid him a bill of long\r\n     standing in the bank notes that he had given the grocer.\r\n     This story they stuck to, through all sorts of cross\r\n     examination. Another diligent search of the house and\r\n     adjacent premises was made, but nothing found. People living\r\n     in the house nearest them, said that before daylight they\r\n     had heard them up, and saw a light in the house, which was\r\n     an unusual circumstance. The eldest boy, however, explained\r\n     that he was raising a pet pig by hand, and that he was up so\r\n     early because his pig was hungry and he had to feed it.\r\n     Things went on in this manner till nearly night, when a new\r\n     clew was struck. A woman living at the outskirts of the\r\n     village had seen the eldest boy pass her house about eight\r\n     or nine o'clock in the morning, carrying a sack, which\r\n     apparently had something in it. No one had, however, seen\r\n     him leave or return to his father's house, and he was there\r\n     when the arrest was made, but the time that he was seen\r\n     corresponded to about the time the grocer was being examined\r\n     about the bills, and the detectives concluded that the\r\n     blacksmith had his eyes open and surmised that they were\r\n     getting warm on the trail, and had then sent out the boy\r\n     with the money in the sack. The boy stoutly denied that he\r\n     had left the house and that the woman was mistaken. So the\r\n     matter rested for the first night. The next morning two\r\n     other persons were found who had seen the boy and the sack\r\n     at the time mentioned. Then the boy being hard pressed\r\n     confessed that his mother had sent him out to a neighboring\r\n     farm to get meal, but not finding any he had left the sack.\r\n     Mr. Greene took the boy to the farm, but the people said he\r\n     had not been there. Then he was brought back and again cross\r\n     examined. He told numerous and conflicting stories, which I\r\n     have forgotten, but succeeded in baffling the detectives the\r\n     whole day. In the afternoon, Mr. Weare wrote me from Marion\r\n     a very despairing note, saying that they were perfectly sure\r\n     that the blacksmith was the thief, but that there was no\r\n     clue to the money, which was the main thing, and suggesting\r\n     that I bring three or four determined men and join him, and\r\n     try by intimidation, whether it was not possible to frighten\r\n     him into giving it up. I acted upon his advice and joined\r\n     him in Marion about nightfall.\r\n\r\n     \"I found him at the house of his mother-in-law in company\r\n     with a couple of dozen of the amateur detectives. They were\r\n     awaiting the return of Wm. Greene, whom the boy was leading\r\n     another wild goose chase. It was the consensus of opinion\r\n     that if the last effort with the boy failed, the crowd\r\n     should take the old man from the jail and threaten to lynch\r\n     him. This might possibly make him confess. I felt perfectly\r\n     sure that the boy had taken the money in the sack and\r\n     concealed it and argued that it would be more easy to\r\n     intimidate him than his father, who seemed to be hardened\r\n     and determined. Objection was made on account of his age,\r\n     and on the score of cruelty, but they finally agreed that I\r\n     might make a trial on the boy, and that in case of failure,\r\n     they would deal with the old man. Pending the discussion,\r\n     William Greene and the boy drove up in a buggy. The boy had\r\n     added another to his many lies about the disposition of the\r\n     sack. He was a sturdy chap of thirteen, and under the\r\n     embarrassing circumstances seemed pretty cool. When they got\r\n     out of the buggy William Greene made a final appeal to him.\r\n     'My boy,' he said, 'you have been lying to us all day as you\r\n     well know, but I will make a last offer to you. If you will\r\n     tell where you have hidden the money, I will give you\r\n     $200.00 and you shall not be hurt, or anything done to you,\r\n     but if you don't, I will turn you over to these men, and I\r\n     don't know what they will do to you.' The boy said, 'that as\r\n     true as there was a God in heaven, he didn't know anything\r\n     about the money, and could tell nothing.' Then I took up the\r\n     role; I seized him by the throat and threw him pretty\r\n     heavily to the ground, and called for a rope; the crowd had\r\n     a rope prepared for the old man, which was immediately put\r\n     about his neck; then I raised him up and told them to throw\r\n     the rope over the limb of a tree under which we were\r\n     standing. They did so and drew it taut, and I said, 'now you\r\n     lying young rascal, we are going to hang you instantly, and\r\n     if you have anything to say, this is your last chance.' The\r\n     suddenness of the attack, and the jar he received in falling\r\n     sort of dazed him; at all events he cried out, 'don't hang\r\n     me and I will tell.' He at once confessed that he had the\r\n     money in the sack, and had buried it in a clump of bushes\r\n     within three hundred yards of where we were. I led him by\r\n     the rope, followed by the crowd, and in a few minutes a\r\n     couple of the men unearthed the sack. We then returned to\r\n     the house, the money was counted and only a few hundred\r\n     dollars was missing from the original $6,000.00 which the\r\n     package contained. The boy in the meantime had regained his\r\n     courage, and on being asked to explain who gave him the\r\n     money, said that while going with the sack for the meal\r\n     early in the morning of the robbery, he had met two men, who\r\n     gave him the money and told him to bury it and they would\r\n     call in a few days and pay him $200.00 for his trouble, and\r\n     that his father had nothing to do with it, and knew nothing\r\n     about it. Asked to describe the men, he looked at the crowd\r\n     and gave a very accurate description of myself and John\r\n     Weare, who stood beside me. The bystanders appreciated the\r\n     joke, and inquired whether Weare and I were not the men. He\r\n     gave us another look and said he was not quite certain, but\r\n     they were men who looked mightily like us, if we were not\r\n     the very men.\r\n\r\n     \"The old man was kept in jail but the boy was left with his\r\n     mother. In a few weeks the prisoner escaped, the boy having\r\n     with an axe one night dug a hole in the wall of the jail. He\r\n     and his father were heard of no more, and were never brought\r\n     to justice. I have always had a sneaking sort of an\r\n     admiration for that boy and feel certain that he must have\r\n     reached distinction in some way or another.\r\n\r\n     \"The above episode took place, if my memory is not at fault,\r\n     about 1854-5, and at that time and on till 1857, the real\r\n     estate dealers and bankers throve apace. Personally I had\r\n     arrived at a position that I thought entitled me to become a\r\n     financier, and in company with L. H. Lehman, of Wooster,\r\n     Ohio, and E. C. Kreider, of Lancaster, Ohio, we opened our\r\n     doors and proclaimed ourselves bankers under the firm name\r\n     of Carpenter, Lehman & Co. Soon afterwards another bank was\r\n     started, the firm name of which I have forgotten, but of it\r\n     Henry Wood, an early settler of the town, was a member. Thus\r\n     Cedar Rapids, with a population of less than 2,000, could\r\n     boast of three banks. Meantime Greene & Weare grew apace,\r\n     and besides the home institution, within a few years they\r\n     established branches in Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Omaha,\r\n     Ft. Dodge, Sioux City, and it may be at other places, and in\r\n     almost every county seat that I can think of there were two\r\n     or three banks. Cook & Sargeant, of Davenport, were the\r\n     Pierpont Morgans of the day, and had even more branches than\r\n     Greene & Weare.\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot remember that there were any banks of issue in\r\n     Iowa, nor do I know what the banking laws of Iowa were at\r\n     that time, but if there were any, they were not so favorable\r\n     as those of the territory of Nebraska. Cook & Sargeant, I\r\n     believe, were the discoverers of the new field, and\r\n     organized a bank at an obscure town in that territory named\r\n     Florence, and very soon currency of the Bank of Florence was\r\n     in active circulation; to keep abreast of the times, Greene\r\n     & Weare started a bank at Fontanelle, a still more obscure\r\n     place in the territory, and bills of the Bank of Fontanelle\r\n     were greatly in evidence. I do not remember what provisions\r\n     were made for the redemption of the notes, but imagine that\r\n     the holders had a pretty tedious journey to get to the\r\n     places of issue. They however did duty as money, made times\r\n     good, and stimulated speculation. When the land office was\r\n     opened at Fort Dodge, I made a trip to that place with John\r\n     Weare, Jr., who went, I think, to establish a branch there.\r\n     The journey consumed several days, and on arriving we found\r\n     all the buildings that had formerly been occupied by the\r\n     soldiers filled to overflowing with land seekers and\r\n     bankers. Not only were the old buildings full, but many were\r\n     in hastily built cabins, and even in tents. There were seven\r\n     banks in full operation; one in a tent which served as a\r\n     background for a large sign, announcing that ten per cent\r\n     would be paid on current deposits. John Garaghty, of\r\n     Lancaster, Ohio, an old friend of mine, had his bank in one\r\n     of the recently built cabins. I found him on the floor of\r\n     the bank, diligently sewing at a bed tick, which was to\r\n     garnish a bunk in one corner where he slept. He seemed\r\n     cheerful, but animadverted severely on his competitor in the\r\n     tent, whom he said was taking a rascally advantage in\r\n     offering ten per cent interest. Things went on swimmingly\r\n     for a couple of years. Immigration was large, lands advanced\r\n     rapidly in price, with plenty of buyers; to make money one\r\n     only had to buy real estate, so we all cheerfully used all\r\n     our cash and credit in that line.\r\n\r\n     \"Without much warning, so far as I can remember, the hard\r\n     times of 1857 struck us, as the stringency extended over the\r\n     whole country. Our supplies were suddenly cut off. We that\r\n     were wearing the 'Lion's skin' began to bray, and to take to\r\n     the tall timber. Our firm fortunately had not gotten\r\n     entirely beyond its depth, but it was in well up to the\r\n     chin. By strenuous efforts we managed to pay our depositors\r\n     and then divided our lands, and went out of business, as did\r\n     the other concern which had started in about the time we\r\n     did. Greene & Weare were left alone in the field, but their\r\n     difficulties were great, and the firm was soon dissolved by\r\n     the withdrawal of John Weare, Jr., whose place was taken by\r\n     Wm. Merritt, and the name changed to Greene, Merritt & Co.\r\n     That financial cyclone I should say wiped out at least\r\n     one-half of the bankers of Iowa, and had they been asked why\r\n     they failed, they could have answered in the laconic terms\r\n     of John Thompson, the bank note reporter, to a similar\r\n     question, 'for want of money.'\r\n\r\n     \"For a couple of years thereafter I devoted my whole time to\r\n     real estate, trying to get rid of my holdings, which were\r\n     more than I could comfortably carry. In 1859, or\r\n     thereabouts, having gotten my affairs into better shape, I\r\n     again embarked in the banking business, having for partners\r\n     John Weare, Jr., and Henry B. Stibbs, both of whom had been\r\n     with the firm of Greene & Weare, the former as a partner,\r\n     the latter as cashier. The firm name was Carpenter, Stibbs\r\n     & Co. Banking had then become more legitimate. The railroad\r\n     had been completed to Cedar Rapids. Commission houses had\r\n     been established. Grain, hogs, and cattle were shipped in\r\n     carloads, which furnished bills for discount; merchants were\r\n     on a firmer basis and did a larger business, and the\r\n     deposits were of considerable volume: real estate and tax\r\n     paying still had a place, but were inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n     \"Things in a commercial way went on pretty smoothly till the\r\n     breaking out of the Civil war. At that time our currency\r\n     consisted principally of bank notes from Wisconsin and\r\n     Illinois, which were based mostly upon state and other bonds\r\n     held by the banks which issued the notes. As these\r\n     securities fluctuated so did the value of the notes. Those\r\n     who held them wanted to deposit in the banks, and when a\r\n     customer came in, the banker had to refer to Thompson's Bank\r\n     Note Reporter to ascertain their value, and even when so\r\n     determined, the risk of the banker was great, because of\r\n     their liability to depreciate. I remember going to St.\r\n     Louis, shortly after the war began to withdraw our account\r\n     from a bank there, and I had to pay 13 per cent for a gold\r\n     draft. Still we managed to worry along and I do not remember\r\n     that many failures occurred. When the war broke out, Cedar\r\n     Rapids raised a company for the first regiment, and as the\r\n     state had no money, our bank furnished the funds to equip,\r\n     maintain, and transport the company to Keokuk, where it was\r\n     mustered into the service. From that time till I entered the\r\n     army early in 1862, I had little to do with the bank. I was\r\n     chairman of a committee of thirteen whose duty it was to\r\n     encourage enlistments and the formation of companies for the\r\n     service, and by subscription to raise money for bounties,\r\n     till finally I went myself and was not mustered out till\r\n     August, 1865.\r\n\r\n     \"From the time I left for the war, I had nothing to do\r\n     actively with the banking business and have never since been\r\n     behind a banking counter in an official capacity. What\r\n     little knowledge I have of the early banking in Iowa, I\r\n     gained there, but as Cedar Rapids was a typical town, I\r\n     imagine that the banking done there was very similar to that\r\n     done in all the other towns of the state.\r\n\r\n     \"After a lapse of forty-four years, one's memory is not\r\n     reliable and you must therefore make liberal allowance for\r\n     errors in date as well as other things. In writing I regret\r\n     the want of old papers and other data, but have done the\r\n     best I could under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n                                  \"Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                     \"SEYMOUR D. CARPENTER.\"\r\n\r\nThe first constitution of Iowa made the following reference to banks:\r\n\r\n     \"The General Assembly shall provide for the organization of\r\n     all other corporations, except those with Banking privileges,\r\n     the creation of which is prohibited.\"\r\n\r\nFor this reason early banking was conducted as a purely private\r\nenterprise, or as a branch of some bank incorporated in another state.\r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of the second constitution in 1857, it became\r\nevident that the state was very much in need of a more stable banking\r\nsystem, so provision was made for incorporated banks, when approved by\r\nvote of the people and for \"The State Bank of Iowa,\" which was\r\nincorporated July 29, 1858, with power to establish branches and issue\r\ncirculating notes. Elihu Baker, a Cedar Rapids banker, was the first\r\nsecretary of the State Bank, and in time fifteen branches were\r\nestablished at different points in the state.\r\n\r\nAlthough none was located here, our business interests received\r\nsubstantial benefit from the improved financial conditions that\r\nresulted from a safe system and a sound currency.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the railroad in 1859, Cedar Rapids entered the field\r\nof commerce and forever put an end, not only to frontier banking, but\r\nto one of the most wonderfully heroic, and, in some respects, beautiful\r\nscenes of its human history--the pioneer life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. D. STEPHENS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADDISON DANIELS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. B. YOUNG]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I. M. PRESTON]\r\n\r\nCountry banking as conducted today, is less crude, more scientific, and\r\nsafer than in the time of which we write, but a fundamental condition\r\nthat has always made it a public necessity remains the same, namely, a\r\nlocal community engaged in the activities of development, production,\r\nand commerce.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the banking needs of Cedar Rapids as a\r\nrailroad town were greater than ever before and several applications\r\nwere made for permission to establish a branch of the State Bank, none\r\nof which, however, was successful.\r\n\r\nThis worthy institution itself proved to be short-lived, for the need\r\nthat brought it into existence was broader than Iowa and soon\r\ncrystallized into the National Bank Act, which was adopted by the\r\nFederal Congress in 1863, and which provided for a National Bank\r\ncurrency and effectually put an end to all other bank note issues, and\r\nthe State Bank of Iowa, having fulfilled its mission, redeemed its\r\nnotes and all other liabilities, and ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nAlthough the national system met with much opposition on the part of\r\nthe larger state banks of New York and elsewhere, and had to overcome\r\nprejudice in the minds of many people throughout the country, its\r\npositive improvement on the old order of things was quickly apparent to\r\nCedar Rapids bankers, resulting in the establishment of two National\r\nbanks in 1864, and the race for charters illustrates a degree of\r\nalertness and competition in those days that would do credit to the\r\nchief of present day hustlers, and verified the old proverb, \"the first\r\nshall be last,\" for the First National Bank, with a capital of\r\n$50,000.00, received charter No. 500 on August 23d, while the City\r\nNational Bank, with a capital of $100,000.00, received charter No. 483\r\non July 19th of that year and was the first to open its doors for\r\nbusiness. During the following year, the First National Bank increased\r\nits capital to $100,000.00. Published reports, about the end of the\r\nyear 1865, show total deposits in both banks of nearly $150,000.00, and\r\nthe full limit of outstanding bank notes $90,000.00 each, thus promptly\r\nand amply providing banking facilities for the rapid development that\r\nfollowed the close of the Civil war.\r\n\r\nCity banking within the memory of our older bankers was practically\r\nconfined to the east and to a very few of the larger cities of the\r\ncountry, and its development in Cedar Rapids and other cities of her\r\nclass illustrates the evolution of banking methods and evidences the\r\nremarkable financial growth of Iowa and the west. In response to the\r\ngrowing needs of jobbing and manufacturing lines, which were then in\r\ntheir infancy, the Merchants National Bank was organized in 1881 by R.\r\nD. Stephens. He was an exceptionally able banker, and his untimely\r\ndeath in 1883 deprived the community of a strong force.\r\n\r\nWith the organization of the Cedar Rapids National Bank, which\r\nsucceeded the private banking business of G. F. Van Vechten in 1887,\r\nthere was inaugurated a systematic effort to encourage and build up a\r\nbusiness with country banks within this territory. Such deposits were\r\ncarried in moderate amounts before this, but were handled more as a\r\nmatter of necessary collections on account of the shipments of live\r\nstock and grain to this center than as a permanent and profitable\r\nbranch of banking. It became evident at this time that the rapid\r\ndevelopment of the state and of wholesale and manufacturing businesses\r\nat this point was bringing Cedar Rapids into closer business relations\r\nwith many other towns, that currency and credit could be handled here\r\nwith equal safety and with greater profit and convenience than in the\r\ndistant east, and with population and wage earners increasing, the\r\nsavings banks assumed their most important place, and thus it came\r\nabout that city banking, like country banking, was the outgrowth of our\r\nmutual business requirements and advantages. Its natural development\r\nled to the organization of the Cedar Rapids Clearing House Association\r\nin 1902, the designation by government authority of Cedar Rapids as a\r\nreserve city for deposits of other national banks in 1903, and to the\r\nexistence of ten active banks today, holding total deposits of over\r\nsixteen million dollars, and completes a record of banking safety that\r\nhas paid its depositors in full throughout its history.\r\n\r\nList of Cedar Rapids banks in the order in which they began business:\r\n\r\nNo. Name                                         Opened  Liquidated\r\n\r\n1   Greene & Weare                                1852     1858\r\n\r\n2   Ward, Bryan & Co.                             1853     1856\r\n\r\n3   Carpenter, Lehman & Co.                       1856     1857\r\n\r\n4   Dodge, Carr & Co.                             1856     1857\r\n\r\n5   Elihu Baker & Co.                             1857     1860\r\n\r\n6   Greene, Merritt & Co.                         1858     1862\r\n\r\n7   Carpenter, Stibbs & Co.                       1859     1869\r\n\r\n8   S.

T. Forbes, at that time cashier of the\r\nCitizens National Bank, and J. M. Dinwiddie, cashier of the Cedar\r\nRapids Savings Bank. During the summer of 1902, Mr. Forbes and Mr.\r\nDinwiddie agitated the matter and in October of that year, as the\r\nresult of their efforts, a committee of Cedar Rapids bankers,\r\nconsisting of John T. Hamilton, J. M. Dinwiddie, Ralph Van Vechten,\r\nJames E. Hamilton, J. W. Bowdish, Lawson Daniels, E. W. Virden, E. M.\r\nScott, Ed. H. Smith, E. E. Pinney, and R. T. Forbes, visited Davenport\r\nand investigated the workings of the clearing house association of that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nFollowing that visit to Davenport, a meeting of the representatives of\r\nthe banks of the city was held on November 3, 1902, at which meeting it\r\nwas formally resolved to form a local association. A constitution and\r\nby-laws were adopted on November 6, 1902, and the clearing house was\r\nregularly organized, with the following banks as members: Merchants\r\nNational, Cedar Rapids National, Citizens National, Cedar Rapids\r\nSavings, Security Savings, American Trust and Savings, People's\r\nSavings. The first officers, elected December 3, 1902, were: President,\r\nJ. M. Dinwiddie; first vice-president, E. M. Scott; second\r\nvice-president, Ed. H. Smith; treasurer, E. W. Virden; secretary and\r\nmanager, R. T. Forbes.\r\n\r\nAfter formal organization the clearing house lay dormant for several\r\nmonths and it was not until January 4, 1904, that the association\r\nactually began the work of daily clearings. The clearings for the first\r\nday amounted to a total of $127,000. The average per week for the first\r\nyear was about $400,000. That the banking business of Cedar Rapids has\r\ngrown with giant strides the past five years is evidenced by the fact\r\nthat the clearings are now running well over one million dollars per\r\nweek and are showing an average gain of 40 per cent over the\r\ncorresponding weeks of last year. The week ending June 5, 1909, showed\r\nthe remarkable increase of 130 per cent over the same week of 1908.\r\n\r\nAt the time of organization the banks of Cedar Rapids had a combined\r\ncapital of $630,000, surplus and undivided profits of $400,000, and\r\ndeposits of $7,800,000. At the present time they have a combined\r\ncapital of $900,000, surplus and undivided profits of over $800,000,\r\nand deposits of $16,000,000. Since the organization of the clearing\r\nhouse the deposits of country banks has increased from $2,000,000 to\r\nmore than $6,000,000, savings and time deposits from $4,200,000 to\r\n$7,200,000, and individual demand deposits from $1,200,000 to\r\n$2,200,000. Such a showing of growth and prosperity is an absolute\r\nindex of local conditions and speaks more eloquently than words of the\r\nsubstantial manner in which this city is forging ahead in things\r\nfinancial.\r\n\r\nJ. M. Dinwiddie served as president until December, 1906, being\r\nsucceeded by E. M. Scott, who served until December, 1908. Mr. Scott\r\nwas succeeded by J. W. Bowdish, who resigned in March of this year,\r\nbeing succeeded by Kent C. Ferman. R. T. Forbes served as secretary and\r\nmanager until December, 1906. He was succeeded by Charles Fletcher,\r\nJr., who held the office until July, 1908, when he was succeeded by W.\r\nJ. Elliott. E. W. Virden, the first treasurer, was succeeded by John\r\nBurianek, Jr., who served until December, 1907, when he was followed by\r\nLouis Wokoun. The present officers are: President, Kent C. Ferman;\r\nfirst vice-president, James E. Hamilton; second vice-president, John\r\nBurianek, Jr.; treasurer, Louis Wokoun; secretary and manager, W. J.\r\nElliott.\r\n\r\nThe present membership comprises all the banks of the city, as follows:\r\nMerchants National, Cedar Rapids National, Commercial National, Cedar\r\nRapids Savings, Security Savings, American Trust and Savings, People's\r\nSavings, Iowa State Savings, Commercial Savings. The clearing house\r\nassociation rooms are under the Merchants National Bank, and here\r\nrepresentatives from each bank in the city meet at eleven o'clock each\r\nday to exchange checks, or \"clear\" the day's business.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Savings Bank was organized December 13, 1905, with a\r\ncapital stock of $50,000. Its officers were C. H. Chandler, president;\r\nW. C. LaTourette, vice-president; James L. Bever, Jr., cashier; with C.\r\nH. Chandler, James L. Bever, Sr., W. C. LaTourette, H. Cushman, John B.\r\nBever, C. B. Robbins, E. J. Carey, A. Jeffrey, and C. Denecke,\r\ndirectors. The bank has enjoyed due prosperity. There have been some\r\nchanges in its officers, C. H. Chandler continuing as its president to\r\nthis date. C. B. Robbins and E. J. Carey are the present\r\nvice-presidents, and Ed. B. Zbanek, its cashier.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa State Savings Bank opened for business January 6, 1906, at the\r\ncorner of Tenth avenue and Third street. The capital stock was $50,000.\r\nIt is known as the \"South End Bank,\" and was organized for the especial\r\naccommodation of business men and individuals in the southern portion\r\nof the city. The first officers were: A. Tomec, president; V. O. Hasek,\r\nvice-president; and Joseph Lesinger, cashier. The present officers are:\r\nV. O. Hasek, president; J. J. Cerveny, vice-president, and Joseph\r\nLesinger, cashier. Present capital stock $50,000; surplus, $5,000;\r\ntotal resources, $525,000; deposits, $700,000.\r\n\r\nThe People's Savings Bank was organized March 10, 1900, with T.\r\nMcCarthy, president; H. E. Witwer and J. J. Powell, vice-presidents; E.\r\nW. Virden, cashier; and T. McCarthy, H. E. Witwer, J. J. Powell, John\r\nM. Redmond, Wm. King, George H. Boyson, A. H. Wolf, Theodore Stark, and\r\nFred H. Shaver, directors.\r\n\r\nA. H. Wolf and George H. Boyson, having disposed of their interests in\r\n1903, at the annual election held January, 1904, C. L. Miller and\r\nGeorge G. Grupe were elected in their places.\r\n\r\nT. McCarthy, on account of his health, did not desire a re-election as\r\npresident, and E. W. Virden, having accepted a position in Louisiana,\r\ncaused a vacancy in the presidency and cashiership. At that meeting the\r\nfollowing officers were elected: H. E. Witwer, president, J. J. Powell\r\nand Fred H. Shaver, vice-presidents; and John Burianek, Jr., cashier.\r\nOn January 9, 1906, at the annual meeting, Mr. Redmond being unable to\r\nserve as a director, did not desire re-election and in his place John\r\nBurianek, Jr., was chosen. On the death of J. J. Powell in 1908, Wm.\r\nKing was chosen one of the vice-presidents. The directors now are H. E.\r\nWitwer, T. McCarthy, F. H. Shaver, G. G. Grupe, Wm. King, C. E. Tuttle,\r\nE. S. Seeley, John Burianek, Jr.\r\n\r\nOriginally this bank had 83 stockholders, the number now being 53. It\r\nhas a surplus of $25,000, undivided profits of $10,000, and deposits of\r\nnearly $900,000.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1911 the bank will occupy its new building on the corner of\r\nFirst street and Third avenue west, one of the handsomest in the state.\r\n\r\nThe Cedar Rapids National Bank was incorporated February 28, 1887, and\r\nsucceeded to the business of G. F. Van Vechten, banker. The original\r\ndirectors were A. T. Averill, Geo. B. Douglas, G. F. Van Vechten,\r\nJoseph S. Cook, C. Magnus, J. M. Ristine, and C. B. Soutter. Changes in\r\nthe board of directors have occurred as follows:\r\n\r\nIn 1888 P. E. Hall succeeded J. M. Ristine. In 1891 Ralph Van Vechten\r\nsucceeded C. Magnus. In 1896 Mr. Magnus was reelected to succeed C. B.\r\nSoutter. In 1899 Ed. H. Smith was elected to fill the vacancy caused by\r\nthe death of J. S. Cook. In 1906 P. E. Hall was succeeded by J. H.\r\nIngwersen. In 1906 C. Magnus retired from the board, and in January,\r\n1907, J. M. Ristine was elected to fill the vacancy. In 1909 C. D. Van\r\nVechten was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of G. F.\r\nVan Vechten, and in 1910 Glenn M. Averill was elected to fill the\r\nvacancy caused by the death of his father, A. T. Averill.\r\n\r\nThe present personnel of the board is as follows: Ralph Van Vechten,\r\nGeo. B. Douglas, Ed. H. Smith, J. M. Ristine, J. H. Ingwersen, C. D.\r\nVan Vechten, and Glenn M. Averill.\r\n\r\nThe original officers were A. T. Averill, president; G. F. Van Vechten,\r\nvice-president; Ralph Van Vechten, cashier. A. T. Averill served\r\ncontinuously as president until his death in 1910, and was succeeded in\r\noffice by Ralph Van Vechten. G. F. Van Vechten was vice-president until\r\nthe time of his death, which occurred in 1909, and he was succeeded in\r\noffice by Geo. B. Douglas. In February, 1905, Ralph Van Vechten\r\nresigned his position as cashier, to assume the second vice-presidency\r\nof the Commercial National Bank of Chicago. At that time he was elected\r\nto the position of second vice-president of the Cedar Rapids National\r\nBank, being succeeded as cashier by J. H. Ingwersen. In 1908 Mr.\r\nIngwersen resigned as cashier to accept the presidency of the Peoples\r\nTrust and Savings Bank of Clinton, Iowa, and Kent C. Ferman, who had\r\nbeen assistant cashier since 1904, was appointed cashier. In 1904 John\r\nFletcher was appointed assistant cashier, and Miss Anna Smouse auditor.\r\nIn 1906 Mr. Fletcher resigned to accept the assistant cashiership of\r\nthe Drovers Deposit National Bank of Chicago. In 1908 Louis Visha was\r\nappointed assistant cashier, and in 1909 Martin Newcomer was appointed\r\nas assistant cashier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. S. JOHNSON An Early Cedar Rapids Settler]\r\n\r\nThe present officers are therefore as follows: Ralph Van Vechten,\r\npresident; Geo. B. Douglas, vice-president; Kent C. Ferman, cashier;\r\nLouis Visha, assistant cashier; Martin Newcomer, assistant cashier; and\r\nMiss Anna Smouse, auditor.\r\n\r\nThe bank has a capital of $100,000, a surplus of $100,000, undivided\r\nprofits of over $100,000, and deposits of more than $3,500,000.\r\n\r\nThe Security Savings Bank was incorporated March 18, 1889, and opened\r\nfor business April 26, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe original stockholders numbered 87, of whom 22 have since died.\r\n\r\nThe original directors were G. F. Van Vechten, C. J. Ives, J. R.\r\nAmidon, Walter D. Douglas, Chas. H. Clark, Jno. E. Murray, W. W.\r\nHigley, J. R. Morin, and W. F. Severa. Changes in the board of\r\ndirectors on account of death or disposition of stock have occurred as\r\nfollows: In 1894 P. C. Frick succeeded J. R. Morin; in 1895 E. M. Scott\r\nsucceeded W. F. Severa; in 1896 B. H. Witwer succeeded Chas. H. Clark,\r\nwhose death occurred during that year; in 1899, on account of temporary\r\nremoval from the city, W. D. Douglas resigned and was succeeded by C.\r\nD. Van Vechten, but on the death of W. W. Higley, later in the year,\r\nMr. Douglas was reelected to succeed him. In 1906 D. K. Harbert\r\nsucceeded C. J. Ives, who died that year, and in January, 1910, Emma M.\r\nVan Vechten was elected to succeed her husband, G. F. Van Vechten,\r\nwhose death occurred the previous September.\r\n\r\nPresident Van Vechten and Vice-President Ives served the bank\r\ncontinuously from its organization to the date of their respective\r\ndeaths; Vice-President Amidon continuously since organization, and\r\nPresident Scott the same--first as cashier, then vice-president, and\r\nafter Mr. Van Vechten's death, as president. On January 1, 1908, J. W.\r\nBowdish was engaged for one year to relieve Mr. Scott, during the\r\nbuilding period, and served as cashier throughout that year. Cashier\r\nFrank Filip entered the employ of the bank in 1894, was promoted to\r\nassistant cashier in 1904, and made cashier in 1909.\r\n\r\nThe original capital stock was $50,000, which was later increased to\r\n$75,000, then to $100,000, and on March 24, 1908, to $150,000. The\r\npresent surplus is $100,000. Its total deposits are now about\r\n$1,800,000, belonging to 5,000 depositors.\r\n\r\nThe bank first opened for business at 211 South Second street. In 1893\r\nit erected on its own ground, 26×60 feet, on the corner of Second\r\navenue and Second street, a three-story brick bank building, containing\r\nthe first exclusive safety deposit vaults in the city. In 1902\r\nadditional ground was purchased and in 1907 the three-story brick\r\nadjoining on the south was purchased and the bank removed to a\r\ntemporary office in this building, while its old home was replaced by\r\nits present eight-story, steel frame, fire proof office building, where\r\nits banking apartments are modern and complete.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian-American State Bank was organized under state charter and\r\ncommenced business June 13, 1892, with a capital of $60,000, its\r\nofficers being W. F. Severa, president; S. L. Dows, vice-president; J.\r\nW. Bowdish, cashier; V. A. Jung, assistant cashier. Among its\r\norganizers were W. F. Severa, S. L. Dows, J. H. Douglas, F. Braun, Jos.\r\nWoitishek, Jos. Renchin, E. E. Pinney, H. B. Soutter, T. C. Munger, C.\r\nButler Weeks, J. J. Powell, and Warren Harman. It had a successful\r\ncareer and paid dividends from its commencement. It was consolidated\r\nSeptember 1, 1894, with the Bohemian-American Savings Bank, in order to\r\navail itself of the more liberal charter given by the state to savings\r\nbanks, the stockholders and depositors practically all remaining with\r\nthe new organization.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Savings Bank was organized under state charter and commenced\r\nbusiness May 1, 1893, with a capital of $50,000. Its officers were\r\nJames H. Douglas, president; W. F. Severa and H. B. Soutter,\r\nvice-presidents; J. W. Bowdish, cashier; and V. A. Jung, assistant\r\ncashier. The directors were J. H. Douglas, F. Braun, H. B. Soutter,\r\nWarren Harman, Jos. Woitishek, S. L. Dows, W. F. Severa, T. C. Munger,\r\nC. Butler Weeks.\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 1893, the articles of incorporation were changed,\r\nincreasing the capital to $60,000, and changing the title to\r\nBohemian-American Savings Bank. At the same date the Bohemian-American\r\nState Bank, desirous of the benefits of the more liberal charter\r\noffered savings banks, arranged to consolidate its interest with the\r\nBohemian-American Savings Bank, which consolidation took effect\r\nSeptember 1, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian-American Savings Bank enjoyed a prosperous growth,\r\nnotwithstanding the effect of the panic of 1893, probably as severe a\r\nfinancial panic as at that time had ever been experienced. It paid\r\nregular semi-annual dividends and continued prosperous until its\r\nconsolidation, March 28, 1898, with the Citizens National Bank and the\r\nAmerican Trust and Savings Bank, two newly organized banks, the\r\nCitizens National Bank taking over the commercial department, and the\r\nAmerican Trust and Savings Bank absorbing the savings department.\r\n\r\nThe Cedar Rapids Savings Bank was incorporated March 13, 1883, and\r\nopened for business May 15, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe original stockholders numbered 36, of whom eight have since died.\r\nThe original directors were Jno. T. Hamilton, Lawson Daniels, Chas. B.\r\nSoutter, Robert Palmer, F. C. Hormel, Jas. L. Bever, Geo. W. Bever, A.\r\nT. Averill, and F. J. Upton.

Higley succeeded\r\nMr. Foster; in 1892, at the death of F. C. Hormel, J. M. Dinwiddie\r\nsucceeded him; in 1897, J. M. Terry succeeded A. T. Averill; in 1900\r\nRobert Sinclair succeeded M. A. Higley, Geo. Goodell succeeded Jas. L.\r\nBever, and E. R. Moore succeeded Geo. W. Bever. President John T.\r\nHamilton, Vice-President Chas. B. Soutter, and Cashier J. M. Dinwiddie\r\nhave served continuously since the organization of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe original capital stock of the bank, paid in cash, was $50,000,\r\nwhich has been twice increased--the first time to $75,000, and then to\r\n$100,000. The present surplus of the bank is $65,000, and the deposits\r\nover $1,850,000.\r\n\r\nThe contract for the bank's six-story, fire proof building, the first\r\nsix-story structure in the city, located at the corner of Third avenue\r\nand Third street, was let May 30, 1895, and the building was occupied\r\nin May, 1896. In 1909-10 an addition was erected, so that the building\r\nis now 90×140 feet.\r\n\r\nIts present officers are John T. Hamilton, president; Chas. B. Soutter,\r\nvice-president; Robert Palmer, vice-president; J. M. Dinwiddie,\r\ncashier; and W. J. Elliott, assistant cashier. Its directors are: John\r\nT. Hamilton, Chas. B. Soutter, J. M.

Cherry.\r\n\r\nThe Merchants National Bank, of Cedar Rapids, was organized February\r\n28, 1881, the first board of directors being R. D. Stephens, John W.\r\nHenderson, P. C. Frick, W. W. Higley, J. C. Broeksmit, A. B. George, S.\r\nL. Dows. Its first president was R. D. Stephens. John W. Henderson was\r\nchosen vice-president, and Charles E. Putnam, cashier.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens died in April, 1883, and was succeeded by M. A. Higley as\r\npresident. In the spring of 1899 John T. Hamilton purchased the\r\nStephens and other interests in the bank, and on June 5, 1899,\r\nsucceeded Redmond Stephens as director. On July 1, 1889, M. A. Higley\r\ntendered his resignation as president, after more than sixteen years'\r\nservice in that position, John T. Hamilton being chosen president,\r\nwhich office he still holds.\r\n\r\nChas. E. Putnam remained as cashier of the bank from the organization\r\nto January 14, 1905, when he resigned and was succeeded by James E.\r\nHamilton, who had been assistant cashier since January 28, 1901. On the\r\nconsolidation of the Merchants National and the Citizens National, May\r\n18, 1908, James E. Hamilton was made vice-president, and John S.\r\nBroeksmit, who had been cashier of the Citizens National, was made\r\ncashier of the new and consolidated Merchants National.\r\n\r\nThe original capital stock of the Merchants National was $100,000. The\r\npresent capitalization is $200,000; surplus, $200,000; deposits of\r\nnearly $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of its organization in 1881 until the consolidation with\r\nthe Citizens National in May, 1908, more than twenty-seven years, the\r\nMerchants National occupied the room in the Ely block at the corner of\r\nSecond avenue and Third street. The bank is now occupying elegant\r\nquarters in the remodeled Cedar Rapids Savings Bank building. The\r\npresent officers are John T. Hamilton, president; P. C. Frick,\r\nvice-president; James E. Hamilton, vice-president; John S. Broeksmit,\r\ncashier; Edwin H. Furrow, assistant cashier.\r\n\r\nThe American Trust and Savings Bank was organized under state charter\r\nand commenced business April 5, 1898, with a capital of $50,000.

Bever, J. B. Bever, W. F.\r\nSevera, Jas. H. Douglas, Geo. W. Bever, F. Braun, T. C. Munger, and\r\nJoseph Renchin. The object of its organization was to establish and\r\nconduct a strictly savings business. It took over at the date of its\r\ncommencement the savings department of the Bohemian-American Savings\r\nBank, and its total deposits on April 9, 1898, were $175,338.23, its\r\nlocation then being at the corner of First street and Second avenue.\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 1899, it moved into the Masonic Temple at the corner of\r\nFirst street and First avenue, which location it still occupies. In\r\n1901 the capital was increased from $50,000 to $80,000. This was\r\nrendered necessary owing to increased deposits, in order to comply with\r\nthe then existing statutes governing the relative allowable amounts of\r\ndeposits to capital stock.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1908, the controlling interest in the bank passed into\r\nthe hands of Ernest R. Moore, Louis Wokoun, and others of their\r\nassociates who were the dominant factors in the Fidelity Trust &\r\nSavings Bank, of this city. They arranged and carried out the\r\nconsolidation of the two institutions. The officers then elected and\r\nboard of directors named continue until this time. The present officers\r\nare Ernest R. Moore, president; W. F. Severa, S. G. Armstrong, and Otto\r\nSikora, vice-presidents; Louis Wokoun, cashier. The board of directors\r\nare: C. J. Deacon, Lew W. Anderson, George Chadima, F. Braun, S.

The dean of Cedar Rapids bankers, Jas. L.\r\nBever, takes an active interest in both institutions. The present\r\nofficers are: J. L. Bever, president; J. L. Bever, Jr., W. C.

Dows, second vice-president; S. S. Dorwart,\r\nS. S. Sweet, E. E. Clark, Ralph Van Vechten, N. M. Hubbard, Jr., John\r\nA. Reed, S. G. Armstrong, and W. L. Crissman.\r\n\r\nIts board elected L. M. Rupert as secretary and the officers as first\r\nselected remained the same during the corporation's continuance under\r\nthe name of the Cedar Rapids Loan & Trust Company. The company was\r\nlocated at the northwest corner of First street and Second avenue and\r\nwas conducted as a trust company until June 1, 1904, when a majority of\r\nthe capital stock passed into the hands of Ernest R. Moore and Louis\r\nWokoun and their associates. In order to bring the institution under\r\nthe operation of the general savings bank laws of the state and to\r\npermit it to transact a general banking business the articles of\r\nincorporation were amended to change the name to The Fidelity Trust &\r\nSavings Bank while at the same time the office of the bank was changed\r\nto 116 South Second street, a location much nearer the business center\r\nof the city. Under the reorganization the stockholders selected the\r\nfollowing officers and directors: W. W. Hamilton, president; Ernest R.\r\nMoore, first vice-president; W. G. Dows, second vice-president; Louis\r\nWokoun, cashier; S. G. Armstrong, E. E. Clark, H. L. Walker, C. J.\r\nDeacon, L. W.

BROMWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nMarion, most fittingly called the \"City Beautiful,\" or the \"Grove\r\nCity,\" was laid out in 1839 on a semi-circular plateau of prairie that\r\nlay within a timbered crescent bordering and following the course of\r\nIndian creek on the west, and opening into a vast extent of prairie on\r\nthe east, to which it lay joined like a protected harbor of the sea.\r\nBefore it was laid out in the spring of 1839, it was located by a\r\nspecial board of commissioners appointed by the territorial legislature\r\nof Iowa in 1838, as the county seat of Linn county, and was named in\r\nhonor of General Francis Marion.\r\n\r\nDavid A. Woodbridge, who was appointed to superintend the work, and\r\nRoss McCloud, the first county surveyor, proceeded to lay out the town,\r\nand on December 2, 1839, assisted by Hosea W. Gray and A. J. McKean as\r\nchain carriers, Elisha Kemp stake driver, and Ira Wilson flagman, and\r\nunder the direction of David A. Woodbridge, agent, the town of Marion\r\nwas platted on the west half of the northwest quarter of section six,\r\ntownship eighty-three, range six, and the east half of the northeast\r\nquarter of section one, township eighty-three, range seven.\r\n\r\nThe town consisted of fifty-six blocks, 250 feet square. The lots were\r\n60 by 120 feet, and the alleys ten feet wide. The four streets that\r\nenclose the public square were laid out eighty feet wide, all other\r\nstreets sixty feet wide. The lots on which the court house and other\r\ncounty buildings now stand, were then reserved for public use, as was\r\nthe park, consisting of the block directly north of that on which the\r\ncounty buildings now stand, and block fifty-six, the southwest block of\r\nthe plat, was reserved for a public cemetery.\r\n\r\nIsbell's Grove, now known as Irish Hill, lay to the southeast of the\r\ntown plat like a beautiful emerald island cut off from the body of\r\ntimber lying south of it by a strip of prairie, where, in 1838, William\r\nK. Farnsworth had entered a claim. He was the first actual town\r\nsettler, although James Preston and Prior Scott had entered a large\r\ntract of land east of Isbell's Grove about the same time, and a part of\r\nwhich lay open until the eighties, and was known as Scott's Prairie.\r\n\r\nSoon after the town was located, Luman M. Strong and James W. Bassitt\r\nlocated northwest of the town; Rufus H. Lucore, west; John C. Berry and\r\nHosea W. Gray, north; James W. Willis, northeast: George W. Gray,\r\nsouth; John Margrave, northwest; and Aaron Moriarity, James and\r\nHenderson Smith on the land now owned by Emmett Kemp; James Blackman,\r\nadjoining on the northeast; Samuel Ross, his mother and several\r\nbrothers, adjoining the Willis place, later known as the E. A. Vaughn\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF MARION, 1868]\r\n\r\nHenry Thompson erected a mill three miles south on Indian creek. The\r\ntimber southwest and west was taken up in small parcels; and Ephraim P.\r\nLewis, one of the second board of county commissioners, and A. B. Mason\r\nsettled between Marion and Cedar Rapids and were the first settlers in\r\nthat direction. All of these came to Iowa in 1839; and in the fall of\r\nthat year the Brodies and Leveriches settled two miles northwest of\r\ntown. A little later Norris Cone settled southeast towards Mount\r\nVernon, and Norman, George, and John Elihu Ives, four miles east; and a\r\nlarge part of the Ives land is now owned by two sons of Elihu Ives,\r\nviz: John and Julius Ives. W. L. Winter and wife settled on Dry\r\ncreek, northwest of Marion, in 1842; and the wife, Clarissa D.\r\nWinter, eighty-eight years of age in March, 1910, with her mind\r\nunimpaired, and intellect grown seemingly brighter with the years, is\r\nliving with her daughter, Mrs. R. Lee Taylor, in Marion.\r\n\r\nThe first house built in Marion, although then without the town plat,\r\nwas that of Luman M. Strong, erected in 1839. It was also the first\r\ntavern. It stood on the Center Point road, now known as Central avenue,\r\nand occupied the site where Alvin M. Goldsberry built his home, which\r\nis now owned by J. B. Michel. The second house was built the same year\r\nby Henry Thompson and David A. Woodbridge, also outside the town plat,\r\nand on the site now occupied by the residence known for years as the H.\r\nP. Elliott home, on Twelfth street, just north of the Odd Fellows\r\nbuilding. These men also built the first store, a log shanty, near\r\nwhere Charles A. Patten's residence now stands on north Eleventh\r\nstreet; and were licensed by the commissioners as follows: \"Ordered,\r\nthat Woodbridge and Thompson be allowed a license to vend and retail\r\nforeign merchandise at their store in Marion, for one year from the 9th\r\nday of October, 1839.\" In 1840 Addison Daniels came to Marion on\r\nhorseback from Iowa City, seeking a business location, although there\r\nwas not a house nor tree within the city limits, just a sea of tall,\r\nwaving, wild grass with cow-paths running here and there. But he\r\ncontracted with Hosea W. Gray for the erection of a store building\r\n20×22 feet in size, and went to Muscatine by horse and thence to St.\r\nLouis by boat, where he purchased a stock of goods and returned to\r\nMarion. It took him about six months to make the trip, and when he\r\nreturned he found his store room ready, and three residences in the\r\ntown proper, viz: that of George Greene, afterwards judge of the\r\nsupreme court of Iowa, capitalist, and later a prominent citizen of\r\nCedar Rapids, on Main street west of Market street on the lot later\r\noccupied by the residence of Joseph Mentzer in the rear of C. F.\r\nReichert's grocery store; that of Joseph W. Bigger, later a prominent\r\nfarmer southeast of Marion, where Dr. Bardwell lived so many years, and\r\nnow occupied by Eliza Bardwell: and that of L. D. Phillips, built by\r\nJoseph W. Bigger, assisted by James E. Bromwell, as a hotel and known\r\nfor many years as the American House, later as the Newhall, on the site\r\nnow occupied by Ed. Sigfred's clothing store.\r\n\r\nThe first store of Marion, in the city proper, was that of Addison\r\nDaniels, who continued in business for nearly half a century with\r\nmarked success. It stood on the site now occupied by the Home Bakery of\r\nMrs. Smith, on Tenth street. Mr. Daniels was Marion's first postmaster,\r\na man of public spirit, sterling integrity, and unimpeachable\r\ncharacter. He died June 18, 1883.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1840, O. S. Hall, a pioneer of marked christian\r\ncharacter, built a one and a half story frame building just north of\r\nthe first store of Mr. Daniels, where he opened a hotel known as the\r\nIowa House. He also served one term as county recorder in 1843. He died\r\nin 1846, but the hotel was continued by his widow and son, O. S. Hall,\r\nJr., still living in Marion, until 1871, but in later years in the\r\nlarge brick building in the same block at the corner of Tenth street\r\nand Eighth avenue. In the same spring the first jail of the county was\r\nbuilt, a log structure, on lot two, block thirty-six, and where the\r\nCatholic church now stands, at a cost of $635.00. It was built by\r\nWilliam Abbe and Asher Edgerton. William Abbe had removed to Marion\r\nfrom his claim near Mount Vernon on Abbe creek, which was named for\r\nhim, and where the commissioners met to locate the county seat, and\r\nwhich was also one of the first polling places of the county. The first\r\ncourt house was built on the northeast corner of the block occupied by\r\nthe present county buildings. Here the first school was held in Marion.\r\nThe building was bought in 1845 for use as a Methodist church. It was\r\nlater occupied for many years by Leonard Stowe for a bakery and\r\ngrocery, and has recently been remodeled for residence flats. However,\r\nthe county records show that the Methodists had made provision for a\r\nchurch building several years before, but probably by reason of the\r\nscarcity of money in those days, had been unable to build such an\r\nedifice as was required by a resolution of the county commissioners at\r\ntheir April term, 1842, which read as follows: \"Ordered by the Board\r\nthat the Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal church of the Town of\r\nMarion be allowed and they are hereby authorized to purchase of the\r\ncounty agent lots number three and four in block number thirty-seven on\r\ncondition that they pay said agent the sum of ten dollars and erect on\r\nsaid lots a good and substantial church building worth at least $1,500\r\nwithin two years; and the said agent is hereby empowered to execute the\r\nabove sale.\" This description of the lots was doubtless wrong, for\r\nthese were the lots where A. J. McKean built his home, where he lived\r\nuntil his decease. The lots intended, and where the first Methodist\r\nchurch was built, were lots one and two in block twenty-seven. The\r\npresent court house was built in 1841 by George W. Gray, contractor.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1840 Hiram Beales built and operated a saw mill, if\r\nnot the first, one of the first in the county, on Indian creek west of\r\nthe town and on the west side of Indian creek, opposite the site of the\r\npresent Howler Mill. In 1841 Richard Thomas became a partner in this\r\nmill and mill stones were introduced for grinding grain. The first\r\nupper mill stone used in this mill has an interesting history. Ambrose\r\nHarland, once sheriff of Linn county, and who first lived at the place\r\nknown later as the \"Old Stone Barn,\" on the old road between Marion and\r\nCedar Rapids, was a stone mason and built the first brick residence in\r\nMarion in 1842 for William H. Woodbridge. This house stood in the\r\nstreet, where now the Methodist parsonage stands, and was for years\r\nknown as the Berry house. In 1884 Samuel Daniels, who settled in Marion\r\nafter the war and was Linn county's third auditor, bought this Berry\r\nhouse, and by reason of it occupying a part of the street and thus\r\ndisfiguring the block of which Mr. Daniels owned the greater part, tore\r\nit down. As one of the corner stones of this house, Mr. Daniels found\r\nthis first upper mill stone of the Beales and Thomas mill, which had in\r\n1842 been replaced by a larger one, and has preserved it as a relic of\r\nearly days.\r\n\r\nRichard Thomas, commonly known as \"Uncle Dick,\" came to Marion in 1840,\r\nand was a remarkable character. His farm embraced what is now known as\r\n\"Orchard Heights,\" one of the most beautiful additions of Marion. He\r\nwas of southern birth, quaint, plain-spoken, energetic, and died in\r\n1893 at the age of 111 years. His widow and daughter, Mary English,\r\nalso a widow, occupy a beautiful home in \"Orchard Heights\" near the\r\noriginal building site of the old farm.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the first school house was built in Marion by subscription, and\r\non the site now occupied by the C. R. Fairfield Lumber Company's\r\noffice. It stood alone in the open prairie, and was surrounded by wild\r\ngrass fully five feet high. Mr. Higby was Marion's first school master.\r\nIt was in this building that Rev. Mr. Emerson organized the first\r\nMethodist society.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 the territorial legislature appointed Richard Knott, Lyman\r\nDillon, and Benjamin Nye commissioners to locate the \"seat of justice\"\r\nin Linn county, and on the first Monday in March, 1839, two of said\r\ncommissioners, Richard Knott and Benjamin Nye, met at the house of\r\nWilliam Abbe, on Abbe's creek, and chose the site of the town of Marion\r\nas the proper location for the county seat.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1839, three commissioners were elected to act as fiscal\r\nagents of the county. The polling place was Westport, near the present\r\nsite of Bertram, and Samuel C. Stewart, Peter McRoberts, and Luman M.\r\nStrong were elected. This commission was invested with about the same\r\npowers as are now exercised by the board of supervisors of the county.\r\nThey held their first meeting in Marion on September 9, 1839. H. W.\r\nGray, the first appointed and first elected sheriff of Linn county,\r\nproclaimed the board in session. Its first official act was the\r\nappointment of John C. Berry, clerk. It next named the county seat,\r\nMarion. It next appointed A. J. McKean and William H. Smith\r\nconstables. At its October session, 1839, it divided the county into\r\nthree election precincts, viz: one at William Abbe's, on Abbe creek,\r\nknown as the Sugar Grove precinct; one at Marion, known as the Marion\r\nprecinct; and one at Michael Green's, known as Green's Grove precinct.\r\nThe first election judges of Marion were James W. Bassitt, Henry\r\nThompson, and Rufus H. Lucore. At this session James W. Willis was\r\nallowed $7.75 for five days' work making town stakes and hauling same,\r\n\"three loads.\" The first road laid out was as follows, and ordered\r\nJanuary 6, 1840: \"Beginning at the county line west of Lathrup\r\nOlmsted's farm; thence on the nearest and best ground to the town of\r\nMarion; thence to the rapids of Cedar river; thence to the county line\r\non a direction to Iowa City, the seat of the Territorial government.\"\r\n\r\nWe quote one other entry of the county commissioners made at the\r\nJanuary term, 1840: \"Ordered by the Board that James W. Willis be and\r\nis hereby allowed the privilege of cutting a sufficient amount of\r\ntimber off from the quarter section of land on which the town of Marion\r\nis located to finish a certain frame for which he has already got a\r\npart; provided, however, that he shall not cut any timber that is not\r\nincluded in the streets of said town. Said privilege is granted in\r\nconsideration of house rent and fuel for the January term of this\r\nboard. 1840.\" A very significant entry was made by this board of\r\ncommissioners at its April term, 1840, in which Luman M. Strong, one of\r\nthe commissioners, was granted a license to keep a grocery and \"vend\r\nspiritous liquors at retail for one year at his house near Marion by\r\npaying into the county treasury the sum of $50.00.\" In a later record,\r\nand the only one referring to the claimant as a public officer, R. P.\r\nLowe, district attorney for 1840, is allowed $75.00.\r\n\r\nThe county judge plan succeeded the commissioner system of government\r\nin 1851, and Norman W. Isbell was the first judge, and was elected in\r\n1851. He was succeeded in turn by J. M. Berry, Daniel Lothian, Johnston\r\nElliott, and A. B. Dumont. The supervisor system, one from each\r\ntownship of the county, by order of the legislature, supplanted the\r\ncounty judge in 1861; and Marion was represented on this first board by\r\nA. J. Twogood. In 1871 the present system of county government by a\r\nboard of three supervisors was adopted. County Judge J. M. Berry, in\r\n1855, in his official capacity, contracted for the erection of the\r\npresent jail and fire proof building where the county offices are now\r\nlocated, and this brought on the court house fight of 1855, when the\r\nissues were fairly joined in the contest for election to the county\r\njudgeship between J. M. Berry, representing Marion, and Rev. Elias\r\nSkinner, representing Cedar Rapids. Berry won by a handsome majority.\r\n\r\nHosea W. Gray, a man of marked ability and prominent in the early\r\nhistory of Marion, was elected the first sheriff of Linn county. At the\r\nsame election, to wit: in August, 1839, Thomas W. Campbell was elected\r\ncounty treasurer; Socrates H. Tryon, who was also Marion's first\r\nphysician, county clerk; and G. H. Tryon, was either elected or\r\nappointed the first county recorder. Although it is well authenticated\r\nthat Richard Osborn and Sarah Haines were married in Linn county in\r\n1839, the first marriage in Marion and the second license of record in\r\nthe county is that of James E. Bromwell and Catherine Gray, date August\r\n26, 1841. This saintly pioneer died in Marion May 5, 1900, after more\r\nthan sixty years continuous residence in Marion and on his farm, one\r\nand a half miles east of the town, honored and loved by all. The same\r\nyear John Hunter was married to Hannah Barbary Hines, and Charles Rowe\r\nto Phebe Putnam, and Ans Safely to Margaret Hunter, and Samuel Ross to\r\nMary Vaughn, and John Mann to Mary Mann, and Julius Allen Peet to\r\nEsther Ann Crowe, and Aaron Moriarity to Hannah Ross, and Joseph Crane\r\nto Agnes Bogard.\r\n\r\nHosea W. Gray, who in the Civil war was captain of Company A, Sixth\r\nIowa Infantry, and Linn county's first sheriff, took the first census\r\nof Linn county in 1840, which showed a population of 1,373. The vote at\r\nthe first election in 1839 showed thirty-two ballots cast. October 28,\r\n1840, Peter Garrow, born in Scotland, renounced allegiance to Queen\r\nVictoria and declared his intention to become of citizen of the United\r\nStates. The first divorce case was filed May 26, 1842, and entitled\r\nDyer Usher vs. Mary Ann Usher. At the September term, 1843, it was\r\nordered dismissed. The first divorce granted in Linn county was at the\r\nMarch term, 1844, of the district court, when Parthena E. Hewitt\r\nobtained a decree of divorce from her husband, Oliver Hewitt. The title\r\nof the first case filed in the district court of Linn county is Richard\r\nThomas vs. O. S. Hall, being an appeal case brought for trespass. After\r\nseveral continuances it was dismissed. George Greene, Marion's first\r\nlawyer, was counsel for the plaintiff. William G. Thompson was the\r\nfirst prosecuting attorney for what was called the second circuit,\r\nconsisting of the counties of Cedar, Jones, and Linn, and of the eighth\r\njudicial district after the establishment of the circuit court, in\r\n1868. The first murder committed in Linn county occurred in Marion\r\nMarch 20, 1847, when James Reed--who then and for many years after\r\noccupied the farm later known as the Bachman farm, on the old road\r\nabout half way between Marion and Cedar Rapids, and whose house was\r\ndestroyed by the tornado of 1860--struck Nathaniel Carnagy with a sled\r\nstake, fracturing his skull, from which injuries he died two weeks\r\nlater. Reed was indicted but found not guilty by a jury.\r\n\r\nThe tornado of 1860, which passed through Linn county on Sunday, June\r\n3, started about six miles west of Marion. It struck the southwest part\r\nof the town but the only damage done was to a brick smoke house\r\nstanding west of the house then occupied by Willard Harlan, now the\r\nhome of J. Q. A. Dutton, the last house on the street car line east of\r\nIndian creek. The first deed recorded was for lots five and six, block\r\neleven, Marion, and was executed by the county commissioners April 4,\r\n1843, to Horace Metcalf. The second deed is to Addison Daniels. The\r\nconsideration is nine dollars. It bears the same date and is for lots\r\none and two, block fourteen, the present Clogston home, lot seven,\r\nblock twelve, where the T. J. Davis building on Tenth street now\r\nstands, and lot eight, block thirteen, on a part of which the First\r\nNational Bank now stands. The selection of these lots is good evidence\r\nof the business ability of Mr. Daniels in those early days.\r\n\r\nThe plats of the towns of Marion and Cedar Rapids were recorded on the\r\nsame day, to wit: April 3, 1843, \"O. S. Hall, Recorder.\" In volume 216\r\non page 48, Recorder's office, is a record showing the organization of\r\nthe Presbyterian society, on November 11, 1839. William Vaughn is named\r\nas one of the elders.\r\n\r\nA. J. McKean, who came to Linn county in 1839, helped lay out the town\r\nof Marion, was the first constable of Linn county, and the first\r\nassessor for the whole county, by appointment in 1840. He served as\r\nclerk of the courts from 1854 to 1872, and was one of Marion's most\r\nprominent citizens for over half a century. His brother, Thomas J.\r\nMcKean, was the first mayor of the town of Marion which was\r\nincorporated in 1865. He was elected sheriff of the county in 1859,\r\nserving until the spring of 1861, when he resigned to enter the\r\ngovernment army service, having already served in the Florida and\r\nMexican wars, and November 21, 1861, was appointed brigadier-general,\r\nand after a brilliant service in the Civil war was honorably discharged\r\nin 1865, as brevet major general. On September 5, 1848, he was married\r\nto Sarah T. Gray, who still survives him, is a resident of Marion, and\r\nstill bright and active at the age of ninety years.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent men in the early history of Marion, and we\r\nmight add of the county, was Samuel W. Durham. A courtly gentleman of\r\nthe old school, honored and respected by every one who knew him, he\r\ndied at his home in Marion, May 2, 1909, at the ripe old age of\r\nninety-two years. He was sheriff of Linn county from 1846-1848, county\r\nsurveyor in 1841, serving one term, in 1851 serving one term, in 1871\r\nserving two terms, and in 1889 serving two terms. He was also a member\r\nof the first constitutional convention of Iowa, which convened at Iowa\r\nCity October 7, 1844.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES E. BROMWELL, SR.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Greene, Marion's first lawyer, and who built one of its first\r\nthree residences, was the first member of the General Assembly from\r\nLinn county. He also served in the council, now called the state\r\nsenate, of the third legislative assembly of Iowa, which convened at\r\nBurlington November 2, 1840, representing Cedar, Jones, and Linn\r\ncounties. He also served in the fourth assembly, which convened at Iowa\r\nCity December 6, 1841.\r\n\r\nThe first court was held in Marion October 26, 1840, and the following\r\nrecord was made: \"Minutes of the District Court of Iowa Territory,\r\nwithin and for the county of Linn:\r\n\r\n     \"Iowa Territory  }\r\n                      }\r\n     Linn County      }\r\n\r\n     \"Pursuant to an act of the Legislature of the Territory of\r\n     Iowa, approved July, 1840, the District Court of the United\r\n     States, and also for the Territory of Iowa, met at Marion,\r\n     in said county, on Monday the 26th day of October, 1840.\r\n     Present: Hon.

Fairbanks was the first superintendent of county schools.\r\n\r\nIn the first constitutional convention which was held at Iowa City\r\nOctober 7, 1844, and whose work was rejected by the people at the polls\r\nAugust 4, 1845, Linn county was represented by Thomas J. McKean, Samuel\r\nW. Durham, and Luman M. Strong. At the second one, held at Iowa City\r\nMay 4, 1846, and whose work was endorsed by a small majority at the\r\nelection held August 3, 1846, Socrates H. Tryon represented Linn and\r\nBenton counties.\r\n\r\nThe first estate ministered upon in Linn county was that of James\r\nTravis, who died in December, 1839. James Doty was appointed\r\nadministrator February 15, 1840. His bond was for $200. His bondsmen\r\nwere Jacob Leabo and John Stambaugh. Israel Mitchell, who had been\r\nappointed by Governor Lucas, in 1839, was the judge of probate. It was\r\nthis same Judge Mitchell who located the first town in Linn county,\r\nviz: that of Westport, near the present site of Bertram, and who was\r\nthe orator of the day at the first Fourth of July celebration in Linn\r\ncounty, held at Westport in 1839.\r\n\r\nThe second estate appearing of record was that of William Marion, who\r\ndied July 4, 1840, and of which William Abbe was appointed\r\nadministrator in 1841.\r\n\r\nThe third was the estate of Martin Martindale, who died in February of\r\n1841, and of whose estate William Garrison was appointed administrator.\r\n\r\nThe following is the record of the first coffin made in Linn county:\r\n\"Be it remembered that on the 21st day of June, A. D. 1841, James E.\r\nBromwell filed his account in the Court of Probate against the estate\r\nof Martin Martindale, deceased, in the words and figures, to wit:\r\n\r\n                      \"To J. E. Bromwell, Dr.\r\n     \"To one white walnut coffin,     $12.00\"\r\n\r\nMarion was the home for years of three Mexican war veterans, who were\r\nalso veterans of the Civil war, viz: Thomas J. McKean, G. A. Gray, both\r\ndeceased, and Samuel B. Thompson, now past ninety years of age and\r\nliving with his daughter, Mrs. Nellie Schimmerhorn, of Kansas City.\r\n\r\nMarion was incorporated in 1865. Its first mayor was General Thomas J.\r\nMcKean. The other officers were: recorder, G. A. Gray; trustees, D. H.\r\nMcDanel, who died in Chicago and whose widow is now living in Cedar\r\nRapids; S. W. Rathbun, still living in Marion and editor and proprietor\r\nof the Marion _Register_, which was established as the _Prairie Star_\r\nin 1852 by A. Hoyt; G. F. Woods, who died in Marion some years ago; O.\r\nC. Wyman, now a merchant prince of Minneapolis; and Dr. N. W. Owen, who\r\ndied in 1880.\r\n\r\nThe Marion fire department was organized in 1874 and consisted of the\r\nPhoenix engine company and the J. C. Davis hook and ladder company. D.\r\nP. Thurber was elected the first foreman of the Phoenix company, and A.\r\nJ. Keyes of the hook and ladder company. The first engine house was the\r\nold Baptist church which stood on the site of the present C., M. & St.\r\nP. depot. Such was the beginning of the later noted Marion Volunteer\r\nFire Department, with its matchless Mentzer Hose Company, which as a\r\ndrill corps, under the captaincy of James E. Bromwell, for twenty\r\nyears, in the state of Iowa and elsewhere, challenged all military and\r\ncivic companies, and met all challengers in competitive contests,\r\nwinning over fifty first prizes, cups, and purses, acting as special\r\nescort to Governor Cummins at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904, and\r\nwinning over all contestants at the National Firemen's Tournament of\r\nthe Trans-Mississippi Exposition, held at Omaha in 1898, and retiring\r\nwithout a single defeat as a drill corps after its first three years,\r\nalthough as a fire company it is still active and efficient and the\r\npossessor of a beautiful home of its own on Seventh avenue in Marion,\r\nthe lower story being used as a hose house and armory, and the upper\r\nstory for reception and club rooms.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the Dubuque and Southwestern Railroad, running from Farley to\r\nCedar Rapids, was built into Marion, and in 1872 the Sabula, Ackley &\r\nDakota Railroad--now the C., M. &. St. P.--connected Marion with\r\nChicago. Here it terminated until it was extended west to Council\r\nBluffs in 1880, and south to Kansas City in 1882.\r\n\r\nMarion was especially favored in its early history, as it is today, by\r\ncompetent and popular physicians. Of these there were three, probably\r\nbest known, who are worthy of mention, viz: Drs. Thos. S. Bardwell,\r\nHenry M. Ristine, and N. W. Owen. Dr. Thomas S. Bardwell came to\r\nMarion with his father, Dr. Leonard Bardwell, in 1841. He studied\r\nmedicine with his father, and after attending lectures in St. Louis\r\nbegan practice in Marion in 1850. He was a natural doctor, bringing\r\ninto his practice not only a knowledge of medicine but that intuition\r\nand instinctive comprehension of the law of cause and effect as applied\r\nto the human system which mark the genius in materia medica and\r\nsurgery. He was a great hearted man, kind, generous, charitable, a\r\ndevoted son and brother, a loyal friend and citizen. He died in Marion\r\nin 1895.\r\n\r\nHenry M. Ristine came to Marion in 1842. He, too, was a master in the\r\nministry of relief to human suffering. His genial presence and cheerful\r\nand encouraging words added much to the magic of his medicine. His\r\nfriends were legion. He was welcomed to the homes where he was called\r\nas a physician as a beloved brother, and was always a comfort and a\r\nblessing in the sick room. In the early days and to the second\r\ngeneration his name was a household word throughout Linn county. He\r\nmoved to Cedar Rapids in 1875, where, crowned with success and honors\r\nin his chosen calling, he died in 1897.\r\n\r\nNorman W. Owen came to Marion in 1856. He continued the study of\r\nmedicine, which he had begun in the east, under Dr. Henry M. Ristine,\r\nand graduated from Rush Medical College in 1862. He at once entered\r\ninto a partnership with Dr. Ristine, and during his absence in the\r\nCivil war, he drove almost night and day, attending the large practice\r\nwhich he was left alone to care for. He was a most skilful and\r\nsuccessful physician. He united with a wide knowledge of diseases and\r\ntheir remedies, the tenderness and skill of the trained nurse. An\r\nearnest student, of analytical yet comprehensive mind, he became a\r\npioneer in the discovery of new remedies for human ailments, and while\r\nhe formulated and compounded many preparations now of common use, his\r\ngreatest achievement was the discovery and composition of Owen and\r\nChamberlain's--now Chamberlain's--Colic, Cholera, and Diarrhoea Remedy,\r\na world-wide panacea, of which Dr. Owen was the sole and undisputed\r\noriginator. This alone places him among the \"immortals\" in the realm of\r\nmedicine. He died in Marion in 1880.\r\n\r\nAmong the early great financiers of Marion--and we might say of Iowa\r\nand the west--was Redmond D. Stephens. He came to Marion in 1855. He\r\nwas a lawyer, teacher, and scholar, as well as a banker. He obtained\r\nthe third charter ever issued for a national bank in Iowa, and\r\ninstituted the First National Bank of Marion in 1863. He was one of the\r\ncounty supervisors in 1867, and was elected to the state legislature in\r\n1879. He organized the Merchants National Bank of Cedar Rapids in 1881,\r\nof which, as well as of the First National Bank of Marion, he was\r\npresident when he died in Cedar Rapids in 1883, where he then resided.\r\nHis rare acumen, keen perception, unerring judgment, and almost\r\nprophetic endowment, mastered every business enterprise he undertook\r\nand won for him the merited distinction with which success ever crowns\r\nthe union of genius and studiousness, of being enthroned, honored, and\r\nacknowledged as king in the chosen realm of his life work.\r\n\r\nNo early history of Marion would be complete without mention of that\r\nbrilliant coterie which illumined Linn county's seat of justice and as\r\npillars and ornaments of the law established and adorned the now famous\r\nbar of Linn county. Nothing in later years has compared with the\r\ngladiatorial contests of the early years when true forensic oratory,\r\nkeenest wit, and brilliant satire made forever famous the legal arena\r\nwithin the old court house at Marion. What memories and achievements\r\ncluster about the names of Corbett, Hubbard, Preston, Isbell, Thompson,\r\nYoung and Smyth.\r\n\r\nNathaniel M. Hubbard, the greatest legal general of his time, who\r\nserved one year as judge of the eighth district in 1865, was keen,\r\nalert, tactful, resourceful, and tireless. He won marked distinction in\r\nhis profession, and died in Cedar Rapids a few years ago, as chief\r\ncounsel for the Chicago & Northwestern Railway.\r\n\r\nNorman W. Isbell, student, scholar, interpreter of the law, judge of\r\nthe eighth district in 1862, died in the prime of life, a great mind in\r\na frail body.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Young, brilliant, scholarly, eloquent, came to Marion in 1853;\r\nwas elected prosecuting attorney for Linn county in 1854. He served in\r\nthe state legislature in 1861, in the state senate in 1863, and was\r\nre-elected in 1866. He was army paymaster, with the rank of major,\r\nduring the Civil war, elector-at-large in 1868, and United States\r\npension agent in 1869. Impetuous, fiery, generous, of marked aptness\r\nand ability, he honored and adorned his chosen profession.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smyth came to Iowa in 1843 and to Marion in 1846--the year he\r\nwas admitted to the bar. He was elected prosecuting attorney for the\r\ncounty in 1847, appointed judge of the fourth district in 1853, elected\r\nin 1854, and re-elected in 1856, but resigned in 1857, and with his\r\nbrother, Robert Smyth, and A. J. Twogood established the first bank in\r\nLinn county, later known as the Twogood and Elliott bank of Marion. In\r\n1858 he was chairman of the committee of three to revise and codify the\r\nlaws of the state of Iowa, and the criminal code of 1860 is largely his\r\nwork. In 1862 he was commissioned colonel of the Thirty-first Iowa\r\nVolunteer Infantry, serving until 1864. He then formed a law\r\npartnership with J. B. Young, and was actively engaged in the practice\r\nuntil 1868, when he was elected to congress. He was renominated in\r\n1870, but on September 30, 1870, before the election, died at his\r\nbeautiful suburban home adjoining the city of Marion, now owned by the\r\nSisters of Mercy, and known as St. Joseph's Academy. A man of sound\r\njudgment, a lawyer of merit, a judge of ability, a statesman of\r\nfidelity and purity, he yet stood pre-eminently before all as a man of\r\nintegrity, honor, and character, the true and highest type of the\r\nChristian gentleman.\r\n\r\nI shall now mention as the last, the two greatest lawyers of the early\r\ndays of Marion, judging from their practice, marked success, and\r\ngeneral recognition, viz: Isaac M. Preston, and William G. Thompson.\r\n\r\nIsaac M. Preston came to Marion in 1842. He was elected probate judge\r\nof Linn county in 1842, appointed district attorney for the eighteenth\r\njudicial district of Iowa in 1845, again elected probate judge in 1847,\r\nthe same year was appointed United States district attorney for Iowa by\r\nPresident Polk, was elected to the state legislature in 1848, and\r\nelected the first state senator in 1852 for Linn, Benton, and Tama\r\ncounties. He moved to Cedar Rapids in 1878, where he died in 1880. He\r\nwas possessed of a strong mind, his reasoning was logical, and his\r\nanalysis keen. He aspired to greatness in his profession above all\r\nelse. He was pronounced by competent judges the greatest criminal\r\nlawyer of Iowa in his day. Rugged, determined, persistent, tireless,\r\nprofound, thoroughly versed in the common law, of broad conception, a\r\nclose student and able judge of human nature, deliberate, careful,\r\nprudent; in speech plain, masterful, convincing; he having reached a\r\nconclusion in law or taken a position legally or morally, was seldom if\r\never compelled to compromise or retreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. M. SINCLAIR]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. O. STEWART]\r\n\r\nWilliam G. Thompson came to Marion in 1853 and first began the practice\r\nof law with I. M. Preston. He was prosecuting attorney in 1854, editor\r\nof the Marion _Register_ (which he bought to insure a republican paper\r\nfor Linn county) in 1855 and 1856, state senator in 1856 and 1858,\r\nmajor of the Twentieth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, serving until 1864,\r\nelector-at-large on the republican ticket in 1864, district attorney of\r\nthe eighth judicial district from 1867 to 1874, chief justice of Idaho\r\nin 1878, elected to congress in 1879, and refused to accept a\r\nrenomination. In 1884, to save the republican legislative ticket, he\r\nwas nominated for the state legislature and elected. He was appointed\r\njudge of the eighteenth district in 1894, and was elected in the fall\r\nof the same year, re-elected in 1898 and 1902. He is now living in\r\nretirement with his son. J. M. Thompson, at his beautiful home, \"The\r\nElms,\" on the boulevard between Marion and Cedar Rapids. Major Thompson\r\nwas naturally possessed of the elements of true greatness, viz:\r\nsimplicity, sympathy, generosity, and charity. While he was in truth\r\nthe \"poor man's friend,\" he was more truly everybody's friend. His was\r\na brilliant mind, a tender heart, an eloquent yet poignant tongue. Of\r\nquick intuition, forceful expression, and impassioned oratory, he\r\ncarried juries with the force of the mountain torrent. His great tender\r\nheart was the repository of anybody's troubles or sorrows or legal\r\ndifficulties \"without money and without price,\" if needs be. As a\r\nlawyer he was comprehensive, ingenious, and aggressive. As a judge,\r\nmerciful, conscientious, and just. The equitable appealed to him in\r\nevery branch of the law. No truer friend, no more loyal partisan, no\r\nmore zealous advocate, ever stood rock bound, unchangeable, and\r\nimmovable as William G. Thompson always stood without malice or\r\noffense. Devoted to his home, his wife, and only son, cheerful, sunny,\r\noptimistic, unerring in his measurement of men and motives, charitable\r\nand forgiving beyond belief, honored and honorable, commonplace and\r\ncompanionable, always kind and considerate and helpful, great hearted,\r\nof noble soul, and of almost divine compassion, Judge William G.\r\nThompson has already erected his monument of Christlike deeds, and his\r\nsepulchre will be the inner shrines of the hearts of all who knew him.\r\n\r\nThe character of the early settlers of Marion was of the highest type.\r\nLittle wonder, then, that it has grown into a city of schools and\r\nchurches, that its moral atmosphere has been fairly free from the fetid\r\nbreath of vice and crime, and that its intellectual, spiritual, and\r\nsocial ideals have been largely realized in its system of schools,\r\nnumber and quality of its churches and church membership, and its\r\nunexcelled fraternal organizations, literary and musical clubs, and\r\nsocieties. Of ideal location, modern and progressive, its water supply\r\ndirect from the noted Bowman springs, clean and wholesome, its people\r\ncontented and prosperous, never destined, under the shadow of Cedar\r\nRapids, to be a great city, but unique, beautiful, the county seat of\r\nthe great county of Linn, undoubtedly the prize winning slogan of Cedar\r\nRapids, with Marion substituted, would be acceptable to every resident:\r\n\"Marion suits me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n_Linn County in War_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men and women of Linn county have always been patriotic. They have\r\nresponded promptly and cheerfully to every call to arms. One of the\r\nearliest settlers in the county had served in the Revolutionary war.\r\nNathan Brown, who came here in 1839 and for whom Brown township was\r\nnamed, at the early age of sixteen years joined the American forces.\r\n\r\nT. J. McKean, George A. Gray, A. R. Sausman, William Hampton, S. D.\r\nThompson, \"Democ\" Woodbridge, and a Mr. Courtney served in the war with\r\nMexico. These men all enlisted from this county, entering the service\r\nin June, 1847. J. J. Snouffer, who came to the county in the early days\r\nand who long was an important figure in the business and political life\r\nof Cedar Rapids, was a veteran of this same war.\r\n\r\nIt is not out of place here to say a word regarding T. J. McKean, the\r\nonly man from the county who received the commission of\r\nbrigadier-general in the Civil war. General McKean was born in\r\nPennsylvania in 1810 and entered West Point in 1827, graduating with\r\nhonors in 1831. He immediately entered the service with the rank of\r\nlieutenant, and was stationed in Louisiana. Resigning his commission,\r\nfor a time he followed the profession of civil engineer. He came to\r\nMarion in 1840, and when war with Mexico was declared he raised a squad\r\nof six men as above and joined Company K, 15th Regulars, the only\r\ncompany sent out from Iowa. He served in the Mexican war for a year and\r\na half and then returned to Marion. At the breaking out of the Civil\r\nwar he was holding the office of sheriff of the county. He was not able\r\nto resist the call to arms and surrendered his office to accept a post\r\nas paymaster in the Union army. He entered upon his duties early in\r\n1861. In the fall of that year Governor Kirkwood proposed his name for\r\na brigadier-general. He received that commission and served his country\r\nwith ability.\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 1861, Sumter was fired upon. On the 15th, President\r\nLincoln issued a call for 75,000 ninety-day men. It was erroneously\r\nbelieved that our internal difficulties could be adjusted in that\r\nperiod. Within thirty days after the president's call had reached Iowa\r\nthis state had a regiment in the field. In that regiment, the First\r\nIowa. Linn county had a full company under the command of Capt. T. Z.\r\nCook.\r\n\r\nBefore giving a detailed account of the various companies that served\r\nin the Civil war from Linn county, it may be well to treat briefly of\r\nsome of the stirring events that were witnessed in the county in the\r\nearly days of the war.\r\n\r\nThe board of supervisors early held a special session to provide means\r\nfor the relief of the families of such men as were willing to volunteer\r\nfor field service. At the September, 1861, session of that body the\r\nfollowing resolution was adopted: \"That the Clerk of the Board of\r\nSupervisors issue an order or orders for the benefit and relief of any\r\nof our volunteers now in the United States service, upon the\r\ncertificate and approval of the resident Supervisor of the township in\r\nwhich the family or applicant resides.\"\r\n\r\nThe press and pulpit of the county strongly advocated the cause of the\r\nUnion. No conservative position on the burning question was taken by\r\neither. Many are the emphatic appeals to the loyal spirit of the\r\ncounty. In its issue of April 18, 1861, the _Cedar Valley Times_ has\r\nthis to say:\r\n\r\n\"More than ever, it is now the duty of every true man to respond to the\r\ncall of his country. Party ties are broken, party divisions forgotten,\r\nin the common necessity which summons every true American to the\r\nstandard of his country--to the defence of our Union, our Constitution,\r\nour liberty and our rights.... Every man to his post, that post the\r\nsupport of the Administration.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same issue there was a call for a meeting on that evening to\r\nobtain an expression of the feelings of the people. This meeting was\r\nheld in Carpenter's Hall, Cedar Rapids, and was characterized by great\r\nenthusiasm. Dr. J. H. Camburn presided and Isaac Van Meter acted as\r\nsecretary. These gentlemen, together with Porter W. Earle, William\r\nGreene, H. G. Angle, Dr. Taylor, E. N. Bates, W. H. Merritt, and others\r\ngave stirring talks. At this meeting a despatch was read from Gov.\r\nSamuel J. Kirkwood, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"If Linn county shall tender me a full company of seventy-eight good\r\nmen, properly officered, by Thursday of next week, I will offer the\r\ncompany as one of the regiments required of this state by the President\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed to push the matter of raising a company. On\r\nthis committee were E. N. Bates, T. Z. Cook, W. H. Merritt, J. H.\r\nStibbs and W. R. Sweitzer. Twenty-five names were signed that night to\r\na muster roll.\r\n\r\nOther towns of the county were not behind Cedar Rapids in enthusiasm.\r\nOn the evening of April 19th a mass meeting was held at Kingston, with\r\nJ. H. Elder in the chair. He at once offered his purse to its limit for\r\nthe cause. Here Rev. A. G. Eberhart, and Messrs. Churchill, Stewart and\r\nDetwiler were the speakers. Eight men added their names to the roll of\r\nCedar Rapids volunteers. In Marion a meeting of equal enthusiasm was\r\nheld and a full company volunteered. By noon of the 19th thirty-five\r\nmen had signed a muster roll in Mt. Vernon. A great crowd gathered in\r\nthe chapel of Western college on the evening of the 19th. Young men,\r\nstudents and others, were urged to enroll for the honor of Linn county\r\nand the cause of the union. Nine were added to the list. The meeting\r\nalso contributed five dollars to aid in purchasing bibles for the\r\ncompany--the boys from Western going with those from this city. On\r\nMonday the 22d, this contingent came to the city, and on the same day\r\ntwenty-seven of the Mt. Vernon volunteers were accepted for the first\r\ncompany from Linn county. Captaincy of the company, K, First Infantry,\r\nfell upon T. Z. Cook.\r\n\r\nIn Buffalo township there were but twelve voters, and just half of\r\nthese volunteered for army service. At Palo a spirited union meeting\r\nwas held, and at once thirty-five men pledged their lives to the cause.\r\n\r\nThe boys at once began drilling under J. J. Snouffer, a veteran of the\r\nMexican war. Dr. S. D. Carpenter was made quartermaster of the\r\nregiment. On Saturday, May 4, a flag was presented to the company. On\r\nMay 6 Company K left for Clinton. Following is roster of the company,\r\nat the time it left Cedar Rapids: Captain, T. Z. Cook; first\r\nlieutenant, J. C. Marvin; second lieutenant, Robert Stinson; orderly,\r\nJ. H. Stibbs; second sergeant, J. Van Meter; third sergeant, E.\r\nCoulter; first corporal, R. L. Wilson; second corporal, J. H.

Stewart, Henry Shaffer, John S. Starkweather, L. E. Stevins,\r\nJ. W. Smith, C. C. Smith, E. B. Soper, J. M. Secrist, Geo. F.\r\nSchoonover, J. B. Stine, F. J. Shuey, M. Taylor, E. Thompson, G. F.\r\nVandever, J. N. Van Arsdel, L. P. Winterstein, C. Wynn, William Walt,\r\nD. H. Wilson, Geo. H. Yager, L. J. C. Ziengenfus.\r\n\r\nThe regimental officers were J. F. Bates, Dubuque, colonel; W. H.\r\nMerritt, Cedar Rapids, lieutenant-colonel; A. B. Porter, Mt. Pleasant,\r\nmajor.\r\n\r\nThe company before the close of its services endured many hardships. It\r\ntook part in the skirmish at Forsythe on July 20. On the evening of the\r\n9th of August the First Iowa, under command of Lieut. Col. Merritt\r\njoined the other forces at Springfield, under Gen. Lyon. Marching to\r\nwithin three miles of the enemy's camp at Wilson's Creek, the attack\r\nwas begun at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 10th. It was a severely\r\ncontested engagement. At this battle Gen. Lyon was killed, while\r\npersonally leading the First Iowa. Victory was with the Union army and\r\npursuit of the enemy was continued until nightfall. Following is the\r\nreport made by Captain T. Z. Cook of casualties sustained by his\r\ncompany:\r\n\r\n\"Killed--Private Perry Hoyt. Seriously wounded--E. Coulter, leg; Henry\r\nShaffer, leg and arm; John Stine, leg and breast; E. R. McKee, arm; W.\r\nD. Robins, leg; Samuel Daniels, leg. Slightly wounded--J. O. Stewart,\r\nleg; John Fitzgerald, face; Joseph Hollan, foot; J. M. Chase, back;\r\nGeorge F. Schoonover, arm badly bruised by grape shot. Sergeant Coulter\r\nand Privates Shaffer and Stine were left at Springfield. Isaac Van\r\nMeter, second sergeant, and John H. Stibbs, sergeant, particularly\r\ndistinguished themselves for coolness and bravery. T. Z. Cook,\r\ncaptain.\"\r\n\r\nThis battle really ended the service of Company K. The regiment was\r\nmustered out at St. Louis August 25 and started at once for home. On\r\nthe evening of August 26 the volunteer's returned to Cedar Rapids. The\r\nKingston Guards, of eighty men, with a local company of about the same\r\nnumber, furnished an escort and headed by the mayor and council met the\r\ntrain at the depot. Five thousand people were estimated in the\r\ngathering. The dwellings and stores were illuminated in honor of the\r\nreturn. A procession was formed and marched to the same place where a\r\nfew months before the flag had been presented. On behalf of the city\r\nMayor Bishop voiced its welcome to the volunteers. Judge Isaac Cook\r\nsupplied a little more speech-making and a supper followed of quality\r\nto make these soldiers forget all hardships of camp and march.\r\n\r\nIn other portions of the county the enthusiasm was as great as it was\r\nin Cedar Rapids. The _Linn County Register_ of April 20, 1861, in\r\nannouncing the commencement of hostilities stated that \"already, some\r\nseventy-five persons, in the vicinity of Marion alone, have signified\r\ntheir intention to volunteer under the call of President Lincoln.\" In\r\nits issue a week later the same paper said that \"on every corner the\r\npeople are assembled, in squads of a dozen or more, discussing the\r\nchances of the conflict. Men in the country leave their plows, and rush\r\ninto town, to inquire about the news.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Sixth Infantry, which was mustered in July 6, 1861, Company A\r\nwas entirely from this county. It was organized at Marion. The regiment\r\nwas mustered out at Louisville, Kentucky, July 21. 1865. It saw some\r\nhard battles, several of its officers being killed in action, and\r\neighteen wounded. Of the enlisted men 274 were killed or died in the\r\nservice, and 331 were wounded in action. It is said that this regiment\r\nsuffered more casualties than any other regiment from Iowa. The\r\nregiment suffered severely at Shiloh, Mission Ridge, Resaca, Dallas,\r\nKenesaw Mountain, and Jackson, Miss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. T. Z. COOK]\r\n\r\nIts first captain was Hosea W. Gray, who was succeeded by Tarlton\r\nCaldwell, Willard H. Harland, and Rodney E. Barker, who served as\r\ncaptains at different periods. A. L. Ingram, who entered the company as\r\na private, was first lieutenant at the time of mustering out. Other\r\nwell known names among the officers of this company are those of George\r\nA. Gray, W. M. Harbeson, A. P. Alexander, Samuel D. Springer, C. A.\r\nHuston, Chas. L. Byam. Among the members of the company are found the\r\nnames of T. H. Alexander, Daniel K. Kinley, Chas. Robins, S. A.\r\nStearns, D. F. Stinson.\r\n\r\nGeorge M. Holmes, of this county, entered as sergeant of this regiment,\r\nand was promoted from time to time until he became captain of Company K\r\non July 30, 1863, resigning October 17, 1864.\r\n\r\nIn the Eighth Infantry Joseph C. Stoddard, yet a resident of Cedar\r\nRapids, was commissioned adjutant November 15, 1865, having been\r\npromoted from sergeant-major. Among those from this county in this\r\nregiment may be noted Jno. M. Dawley, J. H. Gardner, Hiram Inks, Wm. H.\r\nOstrander, David G. Usher, Homer H. Phillips, D. W. Yount.\r\n\r\nThe county was also represented in the Ninth Infantry, being especially\r\nstrong in Company K, in which Abraham Bowman was commissioned second\r\nlieutenant and promoted to the captaincy on January 9, 1864. Its first\r\ncaptain was David Carskaddon, afterwards colonel of the regiment. Among\r\nthe familiar names in this company we find those of David Bowman, Jas.\r\nC. Morehead, Oliver B. Cone, John Cone, John S. McKee, J. M. Burkhart,\r\nW. S. Dingman, John W. Gray, I. N. Lutz, A. R. Whiteneck. The company\r\nwas organized in Marion and mustered into the service July 23, 1861.\r\n\r\nIn the Eleventh Infantry these names are noted: Robt. L. Wilson, Samuel\r\nH. Harrison, Chas. W. Mason, Wm. H. McRoberts, Wm. Burge, Henry M.\r\nCook, Jno. Coburn, John Elder, E. P. Listabarger, Wm. Mitchell, Jas. D.\r\nMcRoberts, And. W. Satley, Thos. Strang, John B. Stine, Geo. W. Sparks,\r\nSamuel Shafer, Wm. A. Thompson. Company K of this regiment was\r\norganized in Cedar Rapids, John C. Marvin, captain. It was mustered in\r\nJuly 23, 1861.\r\n\r\nCompany D, Twelfth Iowa Infantry, was captained by John H. Stibbs. The\r\nregiment was organized at Dubuque and mustered into the service\r\nNovember 25, 1861, with Joseph P. Woods, a West Pointer, as colonel;\r\nJohn P. Coulter of Cedar Rapids, lieutenant-colonel, and S. D.\r\nBrodtbeck, major. The Twelfth was then ordered to St. Louis. The Linn\r\ncounty company was organized in Cedar Rapids, and mustered in October\r\n26, 1861.\r\n\r\nFirst of the year 1862 found seventeen members of the company in\r\nhospitals. A malignant outbreak of measles at that time caused many\r\ndeaths in the Twelfth and other regiments.\r\n\r\nDuring the week ending January 15, 1862, Capt. Stibbs, in a letter to\r\nhis brother in Cedar Rapids, reported that six of his men had died in\r\nhospital. These were William H. Webster, William L. Dailey, John L.\r\nJaques, John S. Lee, Jasper Cyner and Henry Haradon. Seventeen others\r\nwere in various hospitals at St. Louis. On Saturday, January 11, the\r\nregiment was ordered to be ready to start for Kentucky on the 15th, but\r\nbecause of ice in the river, these orders were countermanded. On the\r\n27th it was ordered to report to Gen. Grant at Cairo. From thence the\r\nregiment was sent to the mouth of the Cumberland river, and established\r\nits camp in the field. On February 5 it joined the expedition against\r\nFort Henry.\r\n\r\nThe company was at Ft. Donelson when it capitulated. The regiment\r\nremained at Fort Donelson until March 12, when it was moved to\r\nPittsburg Landing. On the evening of the 9th of April news was received\r\nof a great battle at Pittsburg Landing, in which the Twelfth Iowa had\r\nshare. It was only known that slaughter had been immense, and until\r\nfull details were received the anxiety in Cedar Rapids can be imagined.\r\nYet how slow this news was in coming may be judged from an editorial\r\nnote in the _Cedar Valley Times_ for April 17: \"Three of our Iowa\r\nregiments--the Eighth, Twelfth and Fourteenth--were cut off and taken\r\nprisoners while bravely defending their flag and the glory of their\r\ncountry. They fought like tigers. We are not yet able to publish full\r\nlists of losses, and the anxiety so long felt must continue.\"\r\n\r\nThe report made by Lieutenant-Colonel Coulter gave the following\r\nreturns for Company D: Killed--First Lieutenant James B. Ferguson;\r\nPrivates Daniel Luther and James P. Ayres. Wounded--Sergeant J. M.\r\nClark, Corporal Joseph Stibbs, H. C. Morehead and H. Panborn, all\r\nslightly; Privates J. G. Clark and Frank Renchin, severely. R. C.\r\nCowell and Ed. H. Bailey, slightly. Missing--(prisoners)--Capt. J. H.\r\nStibbs, Second Lieutenant Hiel Hale, Orderly Sergeant R. Hilton;\r\nCorporals H. W. Ross and J. J. Broughton; Privates L. M. Ayres, Ed.\r\nButtolph, Samuel Baumgardner, Thomas Barr, J. W. Burch, S. Birch, P.\r\nBrennan, D. L. Conley, D. Conley, F. Dubois, S. A. Flint, W. A. Flint,\r\nA. J. Frees, C. Ferrerbend, H. Grass, P. Gephart, A. Hill, R. L.\r\nJohnson, Eli King, William Lee, John Luther, T. J. Lewis, Wm. B. Lutz,\r\nJ. Lanagan, E. B. Martin, A. J. Milen, D. W. Minor, R. McClain, J.\r\nNicholas, J. O. Sartwell, D. Sivets, J. Scott, L. Snell, R. K. Soper,\r\nA. A. Stewart, J. M. Garponning, W. H. Trowbridge, W. Whitenack, J. J.\r\nWhittam, J. Wagner, J. Craft, F. Curren, R. P. Zuver, A. McIntyre.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Jason D. Ferguson, one of the killed, was at the outbreak of\r\nthe war a student in Cornell College. He was one of that gallant band\r\nwho left their studies to take up men's work. He was a member of\r\nCompany K, First Iowa, serving throughout the brief but arduous\r\ncampaign in which that regiment participated. His efforts were untiring\r\nin organization of Company D, of the Twelfth.\r\n\r\nBut the losses of Linn county soldiers were not confined to those of\r\nCompany D, of the Twelfth Iowa in the battle of Pittsburg Landing.\r\nQuartermaster Mortimer A. Higley sent back to friends in this city, a\r\nlist of those in Company A, Fifteenth Iowa, there killed and wounded.\r\nAmong the killed were Pat H. Kennedy and Wm. W. Wood, privates, both of\r\nCedar Rapids. Wounded, Corporal John Kimbro, in arm, severely;\r\nprivates, Elisha Hopkins, severely; Charles Stewart, slightly; Jacob\r\nBrown, severely; Newton Dawson, and Henry Bunn, slightly, all being\r\nfrom Linn county.\r\n\r\nThe Twelfth Iowa regiment was mustered out and the members from this\r\ncounty returned home during the last week of January. Company D,\r\nenlisted in 1866, came home with the following Cedar Rapids survivors:\r\nS. R. Burch, adjutant; Homer Morehead, regimental quartermaster; John\r\nClark, captain; Eli King, first lieutenant; N. G. Price, orderly\r\nsergeant; H. Pangborn, John Burch, I. G. Clark, B. P. Zuver, sergeants;\r\nJ. Lanagan, John Luther, R. C. Cowell, Josiah Scott, R. L. Johnson, P.\r\nBrennan, A. A. Stewart, T. Lewis, corporals; S. Baumgardner, John\r\nWhittam, Wm. Whiteneck, J. W. Rowen, W. H. Trowbridge, A. J. Freese, R.\r\nS. Martin, J. B. Lambert, Daniel Sivetts, Sam H. Flint, H. Grass, F.\r\nDubois, H. Ross, Wm. Lee and R. K. Soper, privates. Citizens of Cedar\r\nRapids and Kingston gave a reception to these returned soldiers on the\r\nevening of February 6. This took form of a ball at Daniels' Hall and a\r\nsupper served at the American House.\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth Infantry was organized at Mt. Vernon and mustered in\r\nJuly 23, 1861, John Q. Wild, captain. Chas. W. Kepler was a captain and\r\nE. R. Mason a sergeant. Among the members were Geo. W. Doty, Jacob W.\r\nEasterly, Chas. Gardner, Jos. M. Harper, S. P. Harman, D. A. Hamilton,\r\nJas. E. Neal, Robt. W. Thompson, Wm. Thompson, F. A. Varner, Thos. W.\r\nWilson, D. C. Weaver, John Shaver, John Archer, Henry Blessing, Frank\r\nCook, David Hoster, Geo. W. Thompson, John Bierly, Wm. Cline, T. B.\r\nFullerton, John Gregg, Wm. Hackett, Joseph Livington, Jas. A.\r\nMcClellan, O. T. Petit, M. W. Sweet, Wm. Teeters, Edw. Ware, Julius A.\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nIn the Fourteenth Infantry Jos. Legore was a corporal, and a number\r\nenlisted in the regiment from this county. The same is true of the\r\nFifteenth. Sixteenth and Eighteenth regiments. Company A of the\r\nFifteenth was composed largely of Linn county men. M. A. Higley was\r\nfirst lieutenant in this company and later a major in the commissary\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe Eighteenth regiment was organized at Clinton, but Company A was\r\nmade up almost entirely of men from this county. T. Z. Cook, of Cedar\r\nRapids, was lieutenant-colonel of the regiment.\r\n\r\nOn July 9, 1862, Governor Kirkwood called for five additional infantry\r\nregiments from Iowa. In response to this call a \"mass war meeting\" was\r\nheld in Cedar Rapids on the evening of July 22. E. G. Brown was\r\nchairman and J. H. Elder, secretary. The result of this meeting was the\r\norganization of Company A, 20th Iowa. Many of the most substantial\r\ncitizens of Cedar Rapids for the time being laid aside their private\r\nbusiness to engage in raising men for the war.\r\n\r\nThe Twentieth Iowa Volunteer Infantry was composed of five companies\r\nfrom Linn county and five from Scott county. The companies from this\r\ncounty were A, B, F, H, and I. They were mustered into service August\r\n25, 1862. The company went from here to Clinton and from there to\r\nDavenport. On September 5 they took the boat for St. Louis. The\r\nregiment experienced several hard marches in Missouri and Arkansas; it\r\ntook part in the siege of Vicksburg, saw service in Louisiana and\r\nTexas; was in the attack on Mobile, and was mustered out there July 8,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nWilliam McE. Dye, of Marion, was colonel of the regiment, William G.\r\nThompson was major. Dr. Henry Ristine was surgeon, C. S. Lake,\r\nadjutant, and J. S. Lake, commissary sergeant. Company A was captained\r\nby E. N. Bates, Company B by Edward Coulter, Company F by N. M.\r\nHubbard, Company H by R. H. Lucore, and Company I by C. C. Cook. Among\r\nthe well known Linn county men in this regiment may be mentioned the\r\nfollowing: Milo Adams, W. H. Boyce, John H. Culp, George W. Homer,\r\nRobert Keeler, George W. Mentzer, John D. Mounce, C. E. and Daniel W.\r\nRobbins, Erin Rucker, John M. Starbuck, B. F. Snyder, F. Uebel, William\r\nD. Robbins, A. J. Mallahan, John J. Robbins, Robert C. Hall, D. G.\r\nManahan, D. A.

P.\r\nEastman, Geo. D. Gillilan, J. N. Huston, James W. Howlett, J. W.\r\nNewhall, E. J. Reynolds, W. Stinson, Geo. A. Gray, J. J. Hollan,\r\nWilliam H. Scott, George W. Wynn, B. P. Wickham, L. D. Elsbery, A. B.\r\nLucore, William Busby, D. L. Castle, S. P. Hollan, James M. Hunter,\r\nHiram Inks, J. D. Jordan, F. A. McConahy, C. H. Sawyer, J. C.\r\nMcClellan, S. L. Dows, William E. Earl, E. D. Stedman, S. F. Seeley,\r\nCasper J. Hart, John W. Whitenack, S. B. Mann, Chas. Morehead, John C.\r\nWeatherwax, John Chambers, George W. Daniels, G. B. Daniels, Abraham\r\nHess, M. B. Plummer, Samuel M. Whiteing, Henry White. J. O. Stewart.\r\n\r\nCapt. J. O. Stewart, long clerk in Cedar Rapids of the U. S. District\r\nCourt, entered Company B of this regiment as first sergeant. In March,\r\n1863, he was appointed second lieutenant and in 1864 commissioned\r\ncaptain. For a year and a half he acted as adjutant of the regiment.\r\n\r\nCompanies F, G. and H in the Twenty-fourth Infantry were from Linn\r\ncounty. E. C. Byam was for a time colonel of this regiment, John F. Sly\r\nwas surgeon, John Q. Wilds, of Mt. Vernon, was lieutenant colonel. C.\r\nL. Byam, D. W. Camp and William H. Smouse were adjutants, F. W. Vinson\r\nwas both a captain and chaplain. W. C. Dimmett was captain of Company\r\nF. John G. Hayzlett and C. H. Kurtz were first lieutenants, T. L.\r\nSmith, A. T. Waln were second lieutenants, and among the members of\r\nthis company may be noted the following: William Camp, Andrew Doty,\r\nJohn W. Firkins, John F. Goudy, John Geiger, William Hall, John A. Ide,\r\nSamuel Johnson, J. H. Kepler, A. Lacock, William McQuiston, John\r\nPeddycoard, John Renfrew. This company was organized at Mt. Vernon.\r\n\r\nW. W. Smith was captain of Company G and among the members of this\r\ncompany were George F. Coleman, James Morrison, David Briggs, A. Cox,\r\nH. H. Felton, Jacob Grow, J. G. Hall, D. W. King, Daniel Matson, John\r\nL. Ogan, John F. Prather, Willis Vance, John H. Worden. This company\r\nwas organized in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\r\nOf Company H William Carbee was captain. Among the other officers were\r\nF. A. Jones, I. B. Dutton, William C. Glover, George W. Martin, J. H.\r\nShanklin, Josiah Bundy, and among the members may be noted Michael\r\nBoyer, C. H. Burlingham, Joe L. Bundy, John B. Bowman, C. H. Branch,\r\nDavid Ely, Z. V. Elsbery, C. R. Elsbery, E. R. Gregg, M. Griffith, T.\r\nJ. Gibson, Benjamin W. Gibson, Joseph Hyatt, F. C. Hunter, I. Lambert,\r\nCharles Penn, D. J. Post, J. S. Vernon, David C. Winans, and John\r\nYount.\r\n\r\nThis company was recruited from Springville, Waubeek, and Prairieburg.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-first Infantry, Company A, Robert Stinson, captain, was\r\nrecruited in northeastern Linn county and was organized at Marion.\r\nWilliam Smyth, of Marion, was colonel of the regiment, G. L. Carhart\r\nsurgeon, L. H. Mason and A. J. Twogood quartermasters, Milo P. Smith\r\nsergeant-major, and Donald Lothian commissary sergeant. J. S.\r\nAlexander, at present postmaster at Marion, was promoted to the\r\ncaptaincy of Company A on June 14, 1864. Dyer Usher and John H. Harvey\r\nwere lieutenants in this company, John M. Robbins, Hiram Deem, Jesse\r\nAbbott, Richard Abbott, Alfred Stinson and A. P. McKinley sergeants.\r\n\r\nLinn county was represented in the Thirty-seventh Infantry by men in\r\nCompanies A, D, G, H and I. Jas. S. Morehead, George A. Calder, G. L.\r\nSnyder are familiar names on the roster of this regiment. Company A was\r\norganized in Cedar Rapids with John Hogendabler as captain. The company\r\nwas made up of men from Linn, Benton and Blackhawk counties. The\r\nregiment was known as the \"Grey Beards.\"\r\n\r\nToward the close of the war some 100-day regiments were organized in\r\nIowa. The county had men in these also--John S. Harrison, J. T.\r\nChristian, Geo. W. Bever, Henry S. Bever, B. F. Snyder, Geo. S.\r\nBushnell, I. S. Barger, John Allsbaugh, H. O. Kearns, R. N. Maudsley,\r\nS. H. Metcalf, N. H. Martin, P. Otterbein, Homer H. Phelps, and others.\r\nHalf of Company E, 46th, Infantry were from Linn county. John Harrison\r\nof Cedar Rapids, was the captain. David B. Henderson, of Dubuque, was\r\ncolonel of the regiment.\r\n\r\nThe county had also scattered representation in several cavalry\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nAccording to the reports of the adjutant general of Iowa, out of a\r\npopulation of 18,947, Linn county furnished 1,737 men for the army from\r\n1861 to 1864 inclusive.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to sum up in brief space what Linn county did\r\nin raising men for the war. Company K of the First Iowa. Company D of\r\nthe Twelfth, the companies raised by Captains E. N. Bates, C. C. Cook,\r\nR. H. Lucore, N. M. Hubbard, and J. P. Coulter, had already gone out\r\nfrom the county or were ready to enter the service early in 1862. W. W.\r\nSmith and Rev. F. W. Vinson had also a full company. More than fifty\r\nmen had been recruited at Western, seventy-five at Springville, a full\r\ncompany at Mount Vernon, some fifty additional men at Marion, and a\r\ncompany was then forming at Center Point.\r\n\r\nIn its issue for August 21, the _Times_ stated: \"Within the past two\r\nweeks she [Linn county] has sent five companies out, and four others,\r\nfull and organized, are waiting orders to leave. A tenth company will\r\nsoon be filled. Nothing less than a regiment will satisfy the martial\r\nfeeling prevailing in our county.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday, August 18, the companies of Captain Cook, Lucore, and\r\nCoulter, about 250 in all, left Cedar Rapids for Clinton. Captain\r\nVinson's company was filled on August 20, with Sheriff W. W. Smith as\r\nfirst lieutenant. This company was made a part of the Twenty-fourth, or\r\n\"Temperance\" regiment. Mr. Vinson later resigned as captain to accept a\r\nposition as chaplain of the regiment. In the meantime Captain T. Z.\r\nCook had received a commission as lieutenant colonel of the Eighteenth\r\nIowa. At the time he was mayor of Cedar Rapids but resigned and Charles\r\nWeare was appointed in his place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMPLES OF CURRENCY USED IN PIONEER DAYS The lower two\r\nsigned by John Weare, President]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1862, Dr. J. H. Camburn, of Cedar Rapids, was commissioned as\r\nsurgeon of the Sixteenth Iowa and about the same time Dr. R. R. Taylor\r\nwas appointed as medical officer of the Fourth cavalry, then stationed\r\nat Benton Barracks, St. Louis.\r\n\r\nTo speak at length of the services rendered in the field by the men\r\nfrom Linn county is not possible at this time. Our boys all\r\ndistinguished themselves for bravery, and suffered patiently the many\r\nprivations to which they were subjected. Many of them saw hard service,\r\nand quite a number were taken prisoners. At Shiloh among the Linn\r\ncounty officers made prisoners were Capt. John H. Stibbs, and Lieut.\r\nHiel Hale of Company D, Twelfth Iowa. These officers were later\r\nreleased on exchange. Captain Ed Coulter of the Twentieth Iowa fell\r\ninto the hands of the enemy down in Texas. It seems that officers of\r\nthe Twentieth were somewhat unfortunate. Major W. G. Thompson was badly\r\nwounded at the battle of Prairie Grove. Captain Bates resigned because\r\nof ill health, returned home, and died. Captain Lucore became ill with\r\nthe small pox and also died. Captain C. C. Cook resigned on account of\r\nsickness, and was succeeded by Joseph McClelland, who at the time was\r\nill in New Orleans. Lieutenant Joseph Holland resigned and came home\r\nsick, dying soon afterward.\r\n\r\nCompany A of the Thirty-first Iowa reached Cedar Rapids after being\r\ndischarged on July 3, 1865. This company went into the war 100 strong\r\nand returned with only about forty. Early in August of this same year,\r\nthe three companies from Linn county in the Twenty-fourth Iowa reached\r\nhome. Of Company C there were only twenty of the original members left.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September, 1865, Cedar Rapids gave the returning soldiers\r\na big reception. The elaborateness of the reception was greatly marred\r\nby a heavy rainfall. The spirit manifested was all right, however.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPANY C, CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nOne of the best known military companies in the state is Company C, of\r\nCedar Rapids. This company was organized November 1, 1883, its first\r\ncaptain being George Greene. Many of the best known young men of the\r\ntown at one time or another have been members of this organization.\r\n\r\nAfter serving a number of years Captain Greene resigned, and for a\r\nshort time W. G. Dows was acting captain. Ed. II. Smith was then chosen\r\nto the position. He was succeeded by George A. Evans.\r\n\r\nW. G. Dows, long a member of this company, for a time was adjutant of\r\nthe First Regiment Iowa National Guards.\r\n\r\nUpon the call for troops because of the Spanish-American war, on April\r\n25, 1898, the entire membership of Company C left that same night for\r\nDes Moines, where the entire First Regiment was assembled. This\r\nregiment was mustered into the United States service as the Forty-ninth\r\nIowa United States Volunteer Infantry. William G. Dows, colonel,\r\ncommanding. After drilling for a time they went to Jacksonville,\r\nFlorida, and then to Savannah, Georgia, where they took a government\r\ntransport for Cuba. The members of the regiment did all kind of service\r\nin the army of occupation, much of it being very laborious. In May,\r\n1899, the regiment returned from Cuba and shortly afterwards was\r\nmustered out at Savannah.\r\n\r\nWhile the company was in the service in Cuba George A. Evans was its\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nA few months later the present Fifty-third Regiment was organized, each\r\ncity in the old regiment being allowed a company in the new. Company C\r\nwas reorganized, and is now a part of this regiment. The first captain\r\nof the new company was Frank Hahn. He was succeeded by T. A. Berkebile,\r\nand he by John Rau, who is now the captain of the company.\r\n\r\nCol. William G. Dows, who is now a member of the governor's staff,\r\nserved for twenty-five years in various capacities in the same\r\nregiment, a service for continuity unequalled. Though offered\r\npromotions, he maintained that he would rather stay by the old boys and\r\nthe old regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH IOWA BATTERY\r\n\r\nPromptly upon the declaration of war in 1898 with Spain a battery was\r\norganized in Cedar Rapids for service in that war. It was mustered into\r\nthe service as the Fifth Battery Iowa Volunteer Light Artillery. Nearly\r\nall of the 100 members came from Cedar Rapids and vicinity. The members\r\nwere enrolled during April and May, and the battery was mustered in at\r\nDes Moines in June by Major Olmsted of the U. S. regulars. The battery\r\nsaw no regular service, but it spent ten weeks in camp waiting, ready\r\nfor service in the field if called upon. George W. Bever was the\r\ncaptain, R. Tasker Forbes and S. Craighead Cook, lieutenants, Charles\r\nA. Loring was first sergeant, Robert M. Witwer, quartermaster sergeant.\r\nDr. C. H. French and Roy Waite were also sergeants in the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n_Odds and Ends of History and Reminiscence_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we give some odds and ends of history and reminiscence\r\nthat could not well be inserted elsewhere or that came into our\r\npossession after the foregoing chapters were written:\r\n\r\nThe result of the vote in Linn county in 1860 showed 2,227 for Lincoln\r\nelectors, 1,220 for Douglas, 24 for Breckinridge, and 84 for Bell. In\r\nRapids township Lincoln had 397, Douglas 201, Breckinridge 3, and Bell\r\n26.\r\n\r\nThe first telegraph line reached Cedar Rapids February 24, 1860.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Sunday, June 3, 1860, a destructive storm occurred,\r\nsince known as \"The Great Tornado.\" It was most destructive about five\r\nmiles north of Cedar Rapids, and passed southward, leaving the county\r\nin the vicinity of Western. Some lives were lost and many buildings\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN OF WESTERN\r\n\r\nWestern was laid out in March, 1856, under the auspices of the United\r\nBrethren church, with the design of forming proper surroundings for the\r\ncollege. Ground was first broken in June of that year. By August, 1857,\r\nthere were forty-three dwelling houses and three hundred inhabitants.\r\nOne college building had been completed. This was of brick, three\r\nstories in height, 36 by 62 feet. This was placed upon a campus of\r\nseventeen acres. Rev. S. Weaver was first president of this\r\ninstitution. The plan was to operate a large farm in connection with\r\nthe college, that students might earn their way. In this new town there\r\nwere already two stores, one hotel built and one building, a blacksmith\r\nshop, two physicians, and fourteen busy carpenters. Land in the\r\nvicinity was worth from $10 to $20 per acre. Its quality was proven\r\nwhen the college president, on his own farm, raised 1,800 bushels of\r\nwheat. There was a railroad coming there, of course, as there was one\r\nprospected to nearly every cross-roads in the state. This particular\r\nline was the Iowa Union, to run from Cedar Rapids to Iowa City.\r\n\r\nWestern was above all things a moral town. One Daniel Quin having\r\nopened a grog shop near the place, where the college authorities could\r\nnot interfere, the people took up the matter. Sentiment was aroused and\r\na mass meeting was held. At this meeting resolutions were adopted,\r\nwhich provided that a committee should wait upon the dram seller and\r\nurge him to desist. In case of his refusal the committee was to try\r\nlegal methods for his suppression. If these proved ineffective the\r\nmeeting was to be again called, to devise further measures. A very\r\nsignificant addendum was that the meeting would support the committee\r\nin any plan which might be considered necessary to eradicate the\r\nobnoxious business. It was further resolved to use the boycott--though\r\nthe Irish captain had not yet given his name to the scheme. In other\r\nwords they were not to employ or trade with any man engaged in the\r\nliquor business or who might in any way support the traffic. It is\r\nperhaps needless to say that Quin surrendered at discretion without\r\nforcing the committee and the people to extremities hinted at.\r\n\r\n\r\nMT. VERNON\r\n\r\nMt. Vernon makes showing in several directions during 1857. The\r\nCongregationalists of that town being without a place of worship were\r\nenabled to rent from the Covenanters. But by the terms of the lease\r\nwith that strict body promise was made that no minister of pro-slavery\r\nsentiments should be heard within the building, nor upon any occasion\r\nwas a musical instrument of any description to be used therein. The\r\ninstitution at Mt. Vernon which had before this time been known as\r\n\"Iowa Conference Seminary,\" was in August, 1857, changed in name to\r\nCornell College. And Mt. Vernon, like the other college town of\r\nWestern, was careful for civic peace and righteousness. Christianity in\r\nthat time and in a new country was required sometimes to be of a\r\nstalwart and muscular kind, that it might meet evil tendencies sharply\r\nand effectively. Thus we learn of the discomfitures of a gang of\r\nrowdies from Linn Grove, who invaded the peace of Mt. Vernon and\r\ndisturbed its Sabbath quietude, with intent to break up a religious\r\nmeeting then in progress. These were overcome, after a tussle, by the\r\nworshippers, and held until passing of midnight brought a civic day.\r\nThen the justice was roused, the disturbers formally accused, tried and\r\nfined to the utmost extent of their resources. The affair was over\r\nbefore one o'clock Monday morning, the rowdies started home with empty\r\npockets, sadder and wiser men, and the godly inhabitants of Mt. Vernon\r\nagain slept the sleep of the just.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nThe Linn County Agricultural and Mechanical Association was organized\r\nin 1855, its first meeting being held at Cedar Rapids in May of that\r\nyear. The organization was completed in July. The object, as stated,\r\nwas \"the encouragement of agriculture, manufactures and the mechanic\r\narts.\" To accomplish this laudable purpose an annual county fair was to\r\nbe held. The first of these was at Cedar Rapids in September, 1855, and\r\nthe second at Marion the next year. These are reported as very\r\ncreditable in exhibits, and fairly well attended. In 1857 the\r\nassociation was incorporated, and in consequence drew $200 from the\r\nstate treasury. The third fair was again at Cedar Rapids, and the\r\nmanagement took the public into its confidence in advance by revealing\r\nits slender resources. The premiums for '56 were not paid, but those of\r\nthe next year were very promptly met, and a surplus remained over for\r\nthe future. These annual fairs were recognized as something to be aided\r\nby all parties, and the various toll bridges notified intending\r\nexhibitors that all live stock taken to the fair would be passed free.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the association for 1860 shows total income of\r\n$462.00, of which amount $259.00 represented the gate receipts. The\r\nexpenditures were $414.95, including $146.98 for premiums. The\r\nindebtedness of the society had increased to $618.65. The amount\r\nreceived from the state each year was $200.00. Officers elected for\r\n1861 were: President, Charles Taylor, Cedar Rapids; vice presidents,\r\nAndrew Safely and W. S. Gott, Marion; secretary, S. D. McCauley, Cedar\r\nRapids; treasurer, Lysander Jones, Marion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST TEACHERS ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nAnother organization, though having nominal existence before this time,\r\nwas really made effective in 1857. This was the Linn County Teachers'\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nOn October 31, on call of J. L. Enos, the teachers and others\r\ninterested met in Cedar Rapids. Mr. Enos was then editor of the _Voice\r\nof Iowa_, the educational organ of the state. At this meeting a\r\nreorganization of the association was effected, and officers elected as\r\nfollows: President, Rev. S. Weaver, president of Western college; vice\r\npresidents, Prof. S. M. Fellows of Mt. Vernon, E. A. Cooley of Marion,\r\nIra G. Fairbanks of Cedar Rapids; secretary, Prof. N. W. Bartlett,\r\nWestern; treasurer, Hon. E. N. Bates of Cedar Rapids. The executive\r\ncommittee consisted of M. Bowman, Franklin township; S. M. Bruce,\r\nWashington; William Parmenter, Western; J. L. Enos, Cedar Rapids; and\r\nA. Witter, Franklin. The work of preparing a constitution was committed\r\nto J. L. Enos, E. A. Cooley, and Ira G. Fairbanks. A further meeting of\r\nthe association was held at Western, December 12th, at which time the\r\nconstitution was adopted and the organization started on a very useful\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET VIEWS IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IN 1910]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST TEACHER'S CERTIFICATE IN CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nThe first teacher's certificate issued in Rapids township reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"This certifies that I have this day examined Miss Susan A. Abbe,\r\ntouching her ability to teach, both in regard to her education and to\r\nher moral character, and I find her well qualified for a teacher of\r\ncommon schools.\r\n\r\n     \"This certificate shall be valid for one year.\r\n\r\n     \"Rapids township, Linn county, Iowa, July 16, 1847.\r\n\r\n                                  \"Alexander L. Ely,\r\n          \"Inspector of Common Schools for said Township.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander L. Ely was one of the early settlers of Cedar Rapids, was\r\ninterested in the public matters of the new town, and early engaged in\r\npolitics. He was also largely interested in real estate, and operated\r\none of the first mills on the Cedar river at the dam, which he caused\r\nto be built with N. B. Brown and other leading citizens.\r\n\r\nSusan A. Abbe, the person to whom this certificate was issued, is still\r\nliving in Hollister, California, and is known as Mrs. Susan Shields.\r\nShe was seventeen years when the certificate was issued, and had then\r\nbeen a resident of the county ten years. She taught for a number of\r\nyears in the public schools of this county.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shields maintains that she was the first legally qualified person\r\nto teach in the public schools of Cedar Rapids, according to the laws\r\nthen in force in the state.\r\n\r\nThe evidence seems to confirm her contention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEACHERS' INSTITUTE\r\n\r\nA teachers' institute, first of which record is made and notable in\r\npoint of attendance, was held in Cedar Rapids December 26, 1859, and\r\ncontinued for three days. There was constant drilling for the\r\npedagogues in common school branches. Some sixty teachers were present.\r\n\r\nLinn county teachers held their institute for 1860 at Western October\r\n29-30, with Prof. F. Humphrey of Cedar Rapids, president. Some of the\r\nsubjects discussed may serve to illustrate differences in the times.\r\nQuestion of teachers (presumably male) using tobacco came up, and a\r\nresolution was adopted expressing \"disapproval of the use of tobacco by\r\nteachers, and recommend to those of Linn county to abstain therefrom\r\nentirely.\" Dr. J. Maynard of Tipton made an address on the subject of\r\n\"Children's Rights.\" Prof. Wheeler of Cornell orated on \"Demosthenes.\"\r\nEditor Jerome of the Iowa City _Republican_ urged teachers to use the\r\npress as an ally in the cause of education.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Ruth A. Dale, of Cedar Rapids, sister of Elias Doty, now living\r\nnear Bertram, where the family settled in the early days--1839--has\r\ndistinct recollections of pioneer life in the county. She states that\r\nAretas Crane and Daniel C. Doty, brothers of Elias and James M. Doty,\r\nthe pioneers, settled at Ft. Stevens, now Davenport, in 1836 or\r\n1837--1836 she believes is the correct date. Daniel Doty and his son,\r\nJ. M. Doty, and his son-in-law, Aretas Crane, passed over the ground on\r\nwhich Cedar Rapids now stands in 1837. This being the fact, it is\r\nevident that these people were the first white men to look upon the\r\npresent site of the city, with a view to finding a permanent settlement\r\nfor themselves. They, however, after looking over the ground concluded\r\nthat the site afterwards known as Westport, and somewhat later as\r\nNewark, was the preferable location. They returned to their home at\r\nMiddletown, Butler county, Ohio, and arranged their affairs. James M.\r\nDoty and Elias Doty, sons of Daniel Doty, returned to the county in\r\n1839 and took up a claim at Westport. There they started what was,\r\nwithout question, the first manufacturing plant within the limits of\r\nthe county, and possibly in the state. This was a pottery. The date of\r\nits establishment was probably in 1840. Later the same year Elias Doty\r\nbegan the erection of the first saw-mill in the county.\r\n\r\nThe Dotys were induced to come to Iowa through the fact that their\r\nbrother, Daniel C. Doty, was at the time engaged in steamboating on the\r\nMississippi, his headquarters being at Davenport.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the following extracts from a letter written by\r\nElias and J. M. Doty to their parents and dated May 2, 1841, are of\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n     \"I have my mill frame up, that is, the lower frame. The upper\r\n     frame is almost ready to raise. The millwright work can be\r\n     done in about six weeks from the time we raise the frame. I\r\n     have commenced the race. I have three hundred feet in length\r\n     of a race and two hundred feet dam. As soon as I get water to\r\n     it, it will be ready to run.\r\n\r\n     \"There are hard times enough here for anybody. There is\r\n     nothing that will bring cash that I know of. For my part I am\r\n     hard run to live. I would like to have some money. It has not\r\n     come yet.\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot say that we are all well, but we are able to keep\r\n     about. We had a great deal of sickness last fall. I cannot\r\n     say that I like this country, it is too cold for me, the\r\n     ground freezes from two to four feet deep. The frost is\r\n     hardly out yet. The trees look like winter time. I think I\r\n     will leave this place as soon as I can get my business\r\n     settled, and money enough to carry me away. I have between\r\n     two and three hundred dollars coming but can't get enough to\r\n     buy myself a shirt. I bought corn last fall at three cents\r\n     per bushel. I have three claims and want to sell them.\r\n\r\n     \"Last night was a pretty moonlight night. Parmelia kicked up\r\n     a fuss and after all night's watching about six o'clock this\r\n     morning after a bright sunrise she was delivered of a\r\n     prosperous looking son, weight nine pounds, seven ounces.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVOTE OF LINN COUNTY 1910\r\n\r\nThe vote of the county in November, 1910, for governor was as follows:\r\n\r\n     Twp.            Rep.   Dem.\r\n\r\n     Bertram           33     75\r\n     Brown            209    102\r\n     Boulder           76     90\r\n     Buffalo           40     27\r\n     Cedar            133    127\r\n     Clinton           52     64\r\n     College           49     95\r\n     Fairfax           60    111\r\n     Fayette           94     35\r\n     Franklin         385    182\r\n     Grant            124     95\r\n     Jackson          166     51\r\n     Linn              57     57\r\n     Maine            225     79\r\n     Marion           519    391\r\n     Monroe            99     66\r\n     Otter Creek       67     63\r\n     Putnam            43     96\r\n     Rapids          1761   2443\r\n     Spring Grove      83     22\r\n     Washington       145    168\r\n                     ----   ----\r\n                     4420   4439\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there were 382 votes cast for other\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MUNICIPAL FIGURES FOR CEDAR RAPIDS\r\n\r\nThe net taxable value of property in Cedar Rapids for the year 1910, on\r\nthe one-fourth valuation, is $6,579,183. In addition the city has a\r\nmulct tax revenue and an income from licenses, police court fines,\r\netc., of about $60,000 per year, giving a little more than $300,000\r\navailable for city purposes.\r\n\r\nThe real estate valuation for 1910 is $21,280,294, and the personal\r\nproperty is valued at $5,026,438. The valuation twelve years ago was\r\none-half of the above amount. It has increased at the rate of one\r\nmillion dollars per year since 1898. This increase is largely due to\r\nimprovements and new buildings. Land values have doubled in the past\r\ntwelve years. For 1911 the valuation will go above these values as the\r\ncity has increased in value so fast that it will be necessary for the\r\nassessors to raise the valuation on all property for 1911 at least\r\nthree million dollars, which will bring the total valuation to nearly\r\nthirty millions by 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DAYS IN LINN\r\n\r\nIN CEDAR RAPIDS REPUBLICAN JUNE 20, 1910\r\n\r\nBeing in a somewhat reflective mood today I shall attempt to acquaint\r\nyou of a few incidents in a life as memory unfolds them to me. It will\r\nbe necessary before narrating these incidents to introduce to you my\r\nfriend and acquaintance, Colonel McIntyre of Indian Creek bottom,\r\nfamiliarly known as \"Pinkey\" by his class mates at West Point. The\r\ncolonel measured six feet two, symmetrically proportioned, tipping the\r\nscale at a trifle over two hundred pounds, eyes of steel grey, beard\r\nauburn, bordering slightly on the reddish and a military bearing in\r\nkeeping with his long years of service as a disciplinarian. The\r\nincidents of this life take me back some years to that little cabin,\r\nthat stood on the east side of the road running north and south past\r\nIndian creek bottom, built from roughly finished logs hewn from the\r\ntrunks of trees cut from the nearby forest. Time does not seem to\r\nefface from memory recollections with the boys and girls of the\r\nsparsely settled neighborhood, attending spelling schools and such\r\nlike. The unfolding of memory reveals to me versions of the old place\r\nand the childhood days spent beneath the clapboard roof as vividly as\r\nthough it were but yesterday.\r\n\r\nA little farther on up the road from this cabin, perhaps a half mile,\r\nthere is a fork in the road, one fork leading on to what was then known\r\nas Turkey Grove and now to feather ridge, the other on to the Inn\r\ndwellers cave on the \"Pinican\" bluffs. On the flat iron point where the\r\nroad forks was erected the first school house in that vicinity and is\r\nstill standing as a monument to the men who were not afraid to do what\r\nthey knew to be right regardless of the whims and petty clamorings of\r\ndissatisfaction that continually sway committees from the paths of\r\nrectitude and right. From this nucleus of education there go forth its\r\nquota of youth each year to enter higher institutions of learning or\r\ngrapple with the more serious problems of life. The impressions I\r\nreceived while attending this school by the pleasant grove have not\r\nbeen eradicated by the conquering of new worlds or by the glamour of\r\npolitical conquests. Youthful dreams and the bewitching smile of some\r\nfair maid were a source of great pleasure to me; a smile from Miss Rose\r\nLaBelle during school time would set my heart going at a two minute\r\nclip and detract materially from my studies and the routine of school\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFrom this miniature \"college\" have gone forth men and women who are now\r\nwielding an influence almost nation wide in its scope. Some are\r\ngradually wandering from the truths that were enunciated and make a\r\ncardinal principle of its teaching and are now searching in hidden\r\npaths of sociology for new light. I now recall an event that happened\r\nwhile attending this school that conveys to my mind another fact\r\ntending to establish the truth of the proposition, that \"ingratitude\"\r\nis no dream.\r\n\r\nOne bright morning in early spring when all nature seemed aglow with\r\nfreshness and beauty, myself and a number of girls were the first to\r\narrive at school, the teacher, Miss Theresa McCurty, being a little\r\nlater than usual. On entering the school house we were held spellbound\r\nand speechless for a moment by a strange musical yet weird sound which\r\nseemed to come from the rear of the room. It took considerable effort\r\nto muster up courage to make an investigation, but finally a search was\r\nstarted and on approaching the rear end of the room the same musical\r\nweird sound would be at the other end of the room. Now in order to\r\ndiscover what it was that was making this strange weird noise and put\r\nthe intruder to rout and discover if possible what kind of a looking\r\nmonster he was, it was decided that two of us would go around to the\r\nrear and the rest remain in front and keep a sharp lookout for whatever\r\nit might be, when all at once one of the girls let out an unearthly\r\nscream and pointing at some object in the corner of the room shouted,\r\n\"There it goes.\" We all gave chase, although some of the girls were\r\nrather timid on the start, and succeeded in capturing the intruder\r\nalive. It turned out to be a large white wood-mouse. What to do with\r\nthis new and unruly possession was the important question now up for\r\nsolution. Some were in for dispatching it at once, others said let's\r\nturn it loose, but Miss Orrie, who always had an eye for business when\r\nthere was any fun in sight, suggested putting it in the teacher's desk\r\nand the result was that Miss Orrie had her way and we proceeded with\r\nall haste to carry out her plan, the girls holding up the lid of the\r\nold fashioned teacher's desk while I dropped the musical wonder in.\r\nThis done, we went about our play as though nothing was ever expected\r\nto happen, impatiently waiting for something to happen, but not quite\r\nsure what. We didn't have long to wait.\r\n\r\nNow the teacher, Miss Theresa McCurty, was of the type of spinsters who\r\nare apparently self-willed and thoroughly versed in the art of throwing\r\nround them an atmosphere of ability to convince others of their\r\ndependence only on themselves in case of emergency to take care of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe had barely completed the capture and imprisonment in the teacher's\r\ndesk of the musical wonder, when Miss McCurty arrived, ready for her\r\nday's work of training the youthful intellect. It seemed as if this\r\nmorning in particular she was more precise than ever and went about her\r\nwork very deliberately.\r\n\r\nIt was her custom (a custom that the \"Blasting at the Rock of Ages\"\r\nought not to minimize) to read a chapter from some book of the bible\r\nevery morning to the scholars before commencing the further duties of\r\nthe day, and that chapter which speaks about bearing false witness was\r\nthe one chosen for this morning, a very fitting prelude too, to the\r\nfurther developments of the day. We were more prompt than usual in\r\ntaking our seats after school was called this morning with an evident\r\ndesire to impress the teacher as being very attentive to our studies,\r\nbut at the same time keeping one eye in the teacher's direction, so as\r\nnot to miss any of the movements of the teacher in case the anticipated\r\nfun was thrust upon us. Lowell Taylor, the boy who couldn't keep still\r\nif he had to, was bubbling over with mirth (every school has them) and\r\nwas severely reproved for not keeping quiet and for disturbing the\r\nwhole school by his antics. After delivering to Lowell this short\r\nlecture on disobedience she went to her desk to get her bible and as\r\nshe lifted the lid out jumped the prisoner and such a screech as she\r\nlet out seemed to almost freeze the marrow in your bones and sent the\r\ncold chills chasing up and down your spinal column as with one bound\r\nshe made the first row of seats and in a jiffy was clean to the farther\r\nend of the room, perched upon the rear desk with her skirts tucked\r\nsnugly around her shaking limbs and terror pictured in every line of\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nIn this position she remained impervious to all efforts to induce her\r\nto come off her high perch, until a second chase had been made and the\r\nintruder ejected from the room.\r\n\r\nBy recess time she had again settled back in the old well beaten path\r\nand assumed her usual calm and dignified way, her reason, which had\r\nbeen so suddenly dethroned by the advent of the harmless mouse, was\r\nagain gaining mastery of the situation. With the return of reason came\r\nthe tangled threads of suspicion, that perhaps she had been the victim\r\nof a designing bunch of scholars and that a huge joke had been\r\nperpetrated on her. With this object in view she began a systematic\r\nsearch for evidence and among the girls she struck a responsive chord.\r\nThey were ready to convict any one in order to exculpate themselves.\r\nThey gave the whole plot away and every last one of them persisted in\r\ntheir innocence so eloquently that the teacher was fully convinced of\r\nmy guilt. She therefore proceeded to relieve her pent up feelings by\r\nputting into action several of her \"suffragette\" ideas about personal\r\nliberty. She restrained me of mine for the next two weeks during the\r\nnoon hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DOCTORS IN THE COUNTY\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from a paper read in December, 1910, before the\r\nIowa Union Medical Society at its meeting in Cedar Rapids, by Dr. H. W.\r\nSigworth, of Anamosa, himself a pioneer physician in Linn county, is of\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\nI left northeastern Linn county thirty-four years ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 I commenced the study of medicine in Pennsylvania. After that I\r\nwas a tramp schoolmaster, farmer, student at Wisconsin university, and\r\nU. S. soldier. I graduated from Rush in '63. After looking for a\r\nlocation in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, I located at\r\nWaubeek--think of it--in Waubeek, in Maine township, in 1863.\r\n\r\nI had tried it a month at Fairview, in Jones county, before going to\r\nWaubeek. By the way, old Dr. Ristine made his first start in Iowa in\r\nthe same historic town of Fairview before locating in Marion.\r\n\r\nNortheastern Linn county at that time was very much on the frontier.\r\nThere were no bridges on the Wapsie from Quasqueton to Anamosa, but at\r\nCentral City; now there are five. At Waubeek we had a postoffice but no\r\nregular mail carrier. Any one going to Marion took the mail sack and\r\nbrought back the mail.\r\n\r\nOur first mail route was on Friday morning. It left Quasqueton\r\nhorseback, making Paris, Central City (which was formerly called\r\nClark's Ford), Waubeek, Necot (Perkins), Anamosa. Saturday it would\r\nreturn over the same route.\r\n\r\nThe earliest doctor of whom I can get any word of locating in this\r\nterritory was Doctor Ashby at Paris. When I came in 1863, Doctor\r\nPatterson was at Central City. Dr. Lanning was at Paris. He sat next to\r\nme at Rush in 1861 and 1862. Dr. Stacy lived out the Anamosa and\r\nQuasqueton road at Valley farm. I never met him. He sent me my first\r\ncase of fractured thigh in June of 1863; a boy, eight years old, who\r\nlived in a sod house with a board roof, two miles north of McQueen's\r\n(now Hill's Mill), now owned by Coquillette. The splints were made with\r\nan axe and pocket knife out of an old cradle found on the roof of the\r\nhouse. Extension on the ankle was by the top of an old shoe with\r\nstrings through the foot-piece of the Liston splint. Results all right.\r\n\r\nAt Paris, after Lanning came Drs. Byam, Mrs. Dr. Byam, and my brother,\r\nM. P. Sigworth, Fullerton, McTavish, and Ellis, all of whom I knew, and\r\nnot one of them alive now.\r\n\r\nWhere the thriving village of Prairieburg now is was a cross road, the\r\nnortheast corner lying out to commons for years.\r\n\r\nThe first doctor to locate there was Dr. Young. He drove a little\r\nsorrel horse in a light rig with one wheel dished, which made a crooked\r\ntrack, and his disposition was something like the track of his buggy.\r\nFollowing him at this place was Dr. Ellis, who went to that place from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nAt Central City after Dr. Patterson came Mitchell, a state of Maine\r\nYankee. At an early date a majority of the people here abouts were from\r\nthe state of Maine, henceforth the name of Maine township. The Jordans,\r\nFriesons, Clarks, Waterhouses, were early settlers from the state of\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\nDr. Mitchell was a good doctor and a fine man. Poor fellow, he lost his\r\nlife by having administered to him by a mistake a teaspoonful of poison\r\nwhen he was to have a tonic.\r\n\r\nAfter his death at Central City the place was filled by Drs. Ristine,\r\nFisher, McTavish, my son, Dwight Sigworth, and Percy, a scientific\r\nfellow. This field is now filled by Drs. Fisher and Woodbridge.\r\n\r\nWaubeek was in the field of Dr. Love, he going northwest to Nugent's\r\nGrove at times. Dear old Dr. Love was a splendid man, a first-class\r\ndiagnostician and a good physician and surgeon. If he lacked anything\r\nit was aggressiveness in surgery.\r\n\r\nWhile at Waubeek I had for co-laborers Drs. Phipps, Scott, Bowers, and\r\nGrimm. Bowers tried to commit suicide by taking a teaspoonful of poison\r\nwhich made him very sick, but he ultimately recovered. Dr. Grimm was\r\nknown as the Dutch doctor.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Waubeek when the river was high I had a stable on the\r\nnorth side of the river and I used to cross in a skiff to feed my horse\r\nand attend to calls on that side.\r\n\r\nThe north side of the river was all woods for three miles in those\r\ndays, and my practice was largely on that side. I used to go into\r\nDelaware county, and I had a large slice of Jones county. And may I say\r\nit, there are some families in that county which have had no doctor but\r\na Sigworth for forty-four years. After fourteen years I sold to Dr.\r\nCrawford and then in four years he sold to Dr. Woodbridge, who in ten\r\nyears moved to Central City. At the present time Dr. Ward is in\r\nWaubeek.\r\n\r\nThe practice in those days was fraught with a great deal of difficulty\r\nand inconvenience. Swimming the river on horseback was one of the\r\nexperiences which I did not like. Many times have I been wet while\r\nfording the streams with my feet on the dashboard of the buggy, my\r\nattention being taken in guiding my horse to an opening in the timber\r\nor a safe place to land.\r\n\r\nThose were the days in which we drank brandy mixed with sorghum, which\r\nwas browned in the oven. This served the place of coffee. Grape-nuts, I\r\nthink, originated from this.\r\n\r\nOf all of the forty-two doctors whom I have mentioned in this article I\r\nhave met thirty-five, and at the present time there are six doctors on\r\nthis field.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MILL OF CENTRAL CITY\r\n\r\nOne of the land marks of the county is the old grist mill on the banks\r\nof the Wapsie at Central City. For a history of this mill, as well as\r\nfor other interesting matter relative to the neighborhood, we are\r\nindebted to E. S. Wetherbee, editor of the Central City _News-Letter_,\r\nwhich paper in its issue of May 2, 1907, contained the following sketch\r\nand reminiscence:\r\n\r\n     There are in the history of every city or hamlet many\r\n     incidents of early times which are interesting to the\r\n     present day generation, and are often worth recording,\r\n     otherwise they are apt to pass into entire oblivion. But few\r\n     remain of the early settlers of this community to tell the\r\n     story of those early days. Although not one of the first,\r\n     yet being among the very oldest of those yet alive and\r\n     living here is Mr. James Outing, and it is to him we credit\r\n     the data of the contents of this article. [Mr. Outing died\r\n     about a year after this interview.]\r\n\r\n     Among the very first people to settle here may be named\r\n     Chandler Jordan, who still lives on his farm southeast of\r\n     town, old \"Uncle Joe\" Clark, who came in 1839, and other\r\n     families by the names of Heubner, Crawley, Pond, Tisdell,\r\n     and others who might be named who appeared here about the\r\n     same time. For a number of years the only way of getting\r\n     across the river, and that only when the water was low, was\r\n     by fording it somewhere near what is now known as the upper\r\n     bridge. From this the place received its first name, and\r\n     whatever honor was attached to it was given Mr. Clark by\r\n     calling it Clark's Ford.\r\n\r\n     At that time Mr. Clark owned quite a large tract of land\r\n     here, comprising all the land now inside the corporation\r\n     west of Fourth street, the eighty acres lying east of Fourth\r\n     street being owned by some land concern in Cascade. As did\r\n     all his neighbors, Mr. Clark farmed in those days entirely\r\n     with oxen.\r\n\r\n     The place went by the name of Clark's Ford but a few years,\r\n     however, for Mr. Clark and a few others conceived the idea\r\n     of laying out a town, and the Cascade men came over and\r\n     together they laid off the plat, and it was then decided to\r\n     call it Central City.\r\n\r\n     One of the first needs of the people of the little\r\n     neighborhood was a more convenient way of crossing the\r\n     Wapsie, and this meant that a bridge must be constructed.\r\n     Accordingly one was built at the place where the north or\r\n     upper bridge now crosses the river. It was not what in this\r\n     day would be called an expensive structure or so very\r\n     handsome when completed, but it represented much hard work,\r\n     privations, and expense to those interested in the building\r\n     of it. The county had but little to do with it, if any, the\r\n     whole thing being done by popular subscription, and in those\r\n     times, there not being many to subscribe, the task was\r\n     indeed a big one for the little handful of people. There was\r\n     some money raised, but more gave in work, others furnished\r\n     lumber, a stick of timber, and so on, until finally it was\r\n     completed and traffic over it was begun in 1857. This bridge\r\n     did not stand the test long. In the summer of 1859 there\r\n     came a big freshet and the bridge went down stream. With its\r\n     going out occurred an incident, which, though possibly\r\n     forgotten by others, yet still remains fresh in the memory\r\n     of Chandler Jordan. He was on this side of the river and\r\n     while the bridge swayed and was considered unsafe he\r\n     concluded to risk it as he was anxious to get home. He was\r\n     on horseback and over he started. When about half way across\r\n     the bridge began breaking loose, and realizing his danger\r\n     Mr. Jordan jumped off his horse and started on the run for\r\n     the shore. The horse also made an extra effort to find solid\r\n     footing and both succeeded in getting on the opposite bank\r\n     just as the bridge swung out into midstream and started\r\n     floating down the river. It was soon replaced by another\r\n     wooden structure built by the county and costing about\r\n     $4,000. This stood for many years but has long since passed\r\n     away and been replaced by the steel bridge now spanning the\r\n     river on the same site.\r\n\r\n     But we started out to write about the old mill. It still\r\n     stands, and with the exception of the necessary repairs\r\n     which from time to time have been made, contains the same\r\n     timbers and lumber it did when built. In the early fifties\r\n     there came to this neighborhood two men, one by the name of\r\n     St. John, the other by the name of John Peet, both men of\r\n     push and ambition. Realizing the tremendous power to be\r\n     obtained from the waters of the Wapsie, and the ease with\r\n     which a dam could be constructed where it now is, with the\r\n     rocky banks on either side, and knowing the great demand for\r\n     lumber, in the then fast settling community, they begun the\r\n     construction of a dam with the intention of running a saw\r\n     mill with it. The work on the dam was begun in 1855 by the\r\n     two men mentioned, but was not finished until the next year,\r\n     the work being engineered by old Mr. Bowdish, father of I.\r\n     P. Bowdish. It was finished in 1856, as was also the old saw\r\n     mill which stood for many years on the south bank of the\r\n     river and did a flourishing business. Like many other old\r\n     land marks it is gone. But many a stick of timber and lots\r\n     of the old oak boards sawed there may yet be found in the\r\n     older buildings about town.\r\n\r\n     The country all about here was fast settling up, and one of\r\n     the principal crops was wheat. It was a long way to market,\r\n     the nearest railroad station being at Marion. St. John and\r\n     Peet concluded that a flouring mill would be a paying\r\n     enterprise, and began the erection of the mill. The lumber\r\n     was sawed at the sawmill, and the heavy timbers, of which\r\n     there were many, mostly came from a forty on what now\r\n     belongs to the Gus Hatch farm north of town.\r\n\r\n     Mentioning these timbers calls to the mind of Mr. Outing an\r\n     incident which he threw into this narrative. There was a\r\n     character who lived here by the name of Henry Hutchins. He\r\n     was fond of hunting and fishing and would be gone often for\r\n     a period of several days, no one knowing of his whereabouts.\r\n     About this time he disappeared, and his absence became so\r\n     protracted that his many friends began to fear that\r\n     something had happened to him. It was while a party of\r\n     choppers was hunting for timbers for the mill on the forty\r\n     mentioned that one day they found Hutchins' lifeless body\r\n     and beside it lay his gun with every indication that he had\r\n     committed suicide.\r\n\r\n     When the timbers were all on the ground, hewed and framed,\r\n     everybody for miles around was invited and came to help with\r\n     the raising. It was a mammoth job and occupied the better\r\n     part of a week. Mr. Outing was there from start to finish.\r\n     The mill was completed and began operations in 1859. St.\r\n     John and Peet ran it for only about three years when they\r\n     sold it to E. R. Burns, who ran it until 1867, when it\r\n     passed into the hands of Hatch & Co., they paying for it the\r\n     sum of $16,000. They conducted it for five years when it\r\n     again passed into the hands of Mr. Burns who owned and\r\n     operated it until sometime in the latter eighties. Since\r\n     then it has changed hands several times, but the valuation\r\n     for many years has not been one-fourth of what it originally\r\n     was. For a great many years it did a big business grinding\r\n     thousands and thousands of bushels of wheat each season, the\r\n     flour being hauled across the country to Marion by teams. As\r\n     the raising of wheat played out so the value and popularity\r\n     of the mill depreciated until finally, as now, it was used\r\n     only as a grist mill. The building is now owned by parties\r\n     in the east and is being run by T. J. Liddington who runs it\r\n     and any day may be found there taking care of any demands\r\n     made upon him. He works alone, surrounded by a vast amount\r\n     of empty space that was once filled with piles of grain,\r\n     machinery, and the several men required to look after the\r\n     big business.[O]\r\n\r\nLAND ASSESSMENTS\r\n\r\nStatement showing total acreage, valuation and average equalized actual\r\nvalue per acre of land in Linn county for 1909 and 1910.\r\n\r\n     Township       Acreage     Valuation  Average\r\n\r\n     Bertram         15,816    $  705,880   $44.63\r\n     Brown           22,689     1,226,160    54.04\r\n     Boulder         22,275     1,149,447    51.60\r\n     Buffalo         14,985       568,850    37.96\r\n     Cedar           13,268     1,002,296    75.54\r\n     Clinton         20,689     1,256,772    60.74\r\n     College         22,361     1,350,511    60.39\r\n     Fairfax         22,852     1,451,070    63.50\r\n     Fayette         15,463       770,599    49.83\r\n     Franklin        20,621     1,222,768    57.92\r\n     Grant           22,267     1,030,492    46.27\r\n     Jackson         22,090     1,016,365    46.01\r\n     Linn            22,874     1,278,324    55.88\r\n     Maine           29,537     1,345,650    45.55\r\n     Marion          46,922     2,779,332    59.23\r\n     Monroe          22,025     1,044,440    47.42\r\n     Otter Creek     22,423     1,206,721    53.82\r\n     Putnam          17,467       786,950    45.05\r\n     Spring Grove    22,558     1,086,186    48.15\r\n     Washington      18,026       797,423    44.23\r\n                    -------   -----------   ------\r\n         Totals     437,208   $23,076,236   $52.78\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE TABLE\r\n\r\nShowing actual and taxable valuation of Linn county, 1899-1909.\r\n\r\n              Actual value     Taxable value\r\n\r\n     1909    $67,148,140.00   $16,787,035.00\r\n     1908     64,391,760.00    16,097,940.00\r\n     1907     63,806,912.00    15,951,728.00\r\n     1906     59,215,180.00    14,803,795.00\r\n     1905     57,547,092.00    14,386,773.00\r\n     1904     59,404,000.00    14,851,000.00\r\n     1903     57,505,160.00    14,376,290.00\r\n     1902     51,864,092.00    12,941,023.00\r\n     1901     50,501,132.00    12,625,283.00\r\n     1900     48,876,016.00    12,219,004.00\r\n     1899     48,083,716.00    12,020,929.00\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of the settlements in Linn county has been a history of\r\nstruggle, of privation and of endurance. It was not an easy matter to\r\nhave to go to Muscatine or Dubuque to mill and market; to travel by\r\nnight on horseback some fifty miles for a doctor, and equally far to\r\nfind a drug store. There were no roads passable for a greater part of\r\nthe year; the rivers were not bridged, and the streams oftentimes were\r\nswollen so that the only means of crossing was by swimming or by making\r\nsome temporary raft. The pioneer settler who wandered out over the\r\nprairie in a winter blizzard no doubt many times looked for the \"smoke\r\nthat so gracefully curls above the green elms\" to indicate that a cabin\r\nwas near.\r\n\r\nThe new settlers found Iowa as they had so often heard of it as \"a\r\nwilderness of prairie land.\" It was well watered, and along the streams\r\ncould be found enough timber to erect fences and furnish fuel and\r\nrails. They generally located in the edge of the timber and along the\r\nstreams, and hesitated about locating on the prairie till much later.\r\nThere they found richer land than along the timber. These first\r\nsettlers came from the far east and south, Ohio, Indiana, New York,\r\nVirginia, South Carolina, and the New England states. They came from\r\nMaryland, from Kentucky, and Tennessee. Some walked, like Ellis and\r\nCrow. Still others came in canvas covered wagons, in which the family\r\nwere housed. They brought enough utensils to cook their scanty meals.\r\nThe wagon was drawn by horses or oxen, followed by a few cows, an extra\r\nhorse or two, and several dogs. At night they would camp by the side of\r\nsome stream or near an oak tree.\r\n\r\nNot till the fifties and sixties did the foreigners arrive in any large\r\nnumbers. As soon as they had been here a short time they wrote home\r\ntheir first impressions, and from that time a steady stream of foreign\r\nimmigration poured into Iowa. These early pioneers waited long for\r\nrailroads, for steamboats, and for good roads. Their produce was cheap\r\nand money was scarce, while interest was high. But they held on to\r\ntheir claims, ever looking for the brighter day. They possessed\r\ncourage, hope, and the ability to wait and struggle till the times\r\nwould change for the better. While many of the first settlers did not\r\nlive to see their plans realized, later descendants sing their praises\r\nand embalm the memories of those who made the county, the cities, and\r\nthe towns what they are today.\r\n\r\nTruly it can be said of the settlers of Linn county that they were a\r\nsturdy class of men and women, of whom their descendants may be justly\r\nproud. And the old pioneers who remain--when they reflect on the past\r\nand recall the days of old lang syne--cannot refrain from shedding\r\naffectionate tears for those who have gone hence. They call to mind the\r\nlines of the poet:\r\n\r\n     \"Two dreams came down to earth one night\r\n       From the realms of mist and dew,\r\n     One was a dream of the old, old days,\r\n       And one was a dream of the new.\"\r\n\r\nPioneer days in Linn county were days of hardships, often of exposure,\r\nbut their trials only served to develop the manhood and womanhood of\r\nthe early settlers who never thought of returning, whose \"only aim was\r\nto wait and see.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly Kipling's lines apply to conditions as they existed in Linn\r\ncounty in pioneer days:\r\n\r\n     \"To the far flung fenceless prairie\r\n     Where the quick cloud shadows trail,\r\n     To the barn in the neighbor's offing,\r\n     To the land of the new cut rail,\r\n     To the plough in the league long furrow,\r\n     To the gray lake gulls behind,\r\n     To the weight of half a year's winter,\r\n     To the warm, wet western wind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbe, Augustus: letter from, 53\r\n\r\nAbbe, William: mentioned, 10, 92, 102;\r\n  government agent, 11;\r\n  mentioned, 32, 33, 34, 35, 44;\r\n  first settler in the county, 51;\r\n  member state senate, 52;\r\n  Ellis speaks of, 147\r\n\r\nAbbe, Susan: probably first teacher in Cedar Rapids, 198, 481\r\n\r\nAgassiz, Louis: quotation from, 1\r\n\r\nAgricultural Association: first in county, 480\r\n\r\nAlbrook, Rev.
