Many writers have very naturally conceived that the myth of Ixion,\r\nwho is fabled to have embraced a cloud instead of Hera, and so to have\r\nbegotten the centaurs, is really typical of ambitious men; for, although\r\nthey aim at obtaining glory, and set before themselves a lofty ideal of\r\nvirtue, yet they never succeed in producing any very distinct result,\r\nbecause all their actions are coloured by various human passions and\r\nprejudices, just as the herdsmen with their flocks say in Sophokles's\r\nplay:--\r\n\r\n   \"We needs must serve them, though their lords we be,\r\n    And to their mute commands obedience pay.\"\r\n\r\nThese verses really represent the state of those who, in order to obtain\r\nthe empty title of statesmen and popular leaders, govern a country by\r\nfollowing the caprices and impulses of the people. Just as the men\r\nstationed in the bows of a ship see what is coming before the steersmen,\r\nbut yet look up to them as their chiefs and execute their orders; so\r\nthey who govern with a view solely to their own popularity, although\r\nthey may be called rulers, are, in truth, nothing more than slaves of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nII. An absolutely perfect man would not even wish for popularity, except\r\nso far as it enabled him to take part in politics, and caused him to be\r\ntrusted by the people; yet a young and ambitious man must be excused if\r\nhe feels pride in the glory and reputation which he gains by brilliant\r\nexploits. For, as Theophrastus says, the virtue which buds and sprouts\r\nin youthful minds is confirmed by praise, and the high spirit thus\r\nformed leads it to attempt greater things. On the other hand, an\r\nexcessive love of praise is dangerous in all cases, but, in statesmen,\r\nutterly ruinous; for when it takes hold of men in the possession of\r\ngreat power it drives them to commit acts of sheer madness, because they\r\nforget that honourable conduct must increase their popularity, and think\r\nthat any measure that increases their popularity must necessarily be a\r\ngood one. We ought to tell the people that they cannot have the same man\r\nto lead them and to follow them, just as Phokion is said to have replied\r\nto Antipater, when he demanded some disgraceful service from him, \"I\r\ncannot be Antipater's friend and his toady at the same time.\" One might\r\nalso quote the fable of the serpent's tail which murmured against the\r\nhead and desired sometimes to take the lead, and not always follow the\r\nhead, but which when allowed to lead the way took the wrong path and\r\ncaused the head to be miserably crushed, because it allowed itself to be\r\nguided by that which could neither see nor hear. This has been the fate\r\nof many of those politicians who court the favour of the people; for,\r\nafter they have once shared their blind impulses, they lose the power of\r\nchecking their folly, and of restoring good discipline and order. These\r\nreflections upon the favour of the people occurred to me when I thought\r\nof its power, as shown in the case of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, men\r\nwho were well born, well educated, and began their political career with\r\ngreat promise, and yet were ruined, not so much by an excessive craving\r\nfor popular applause as by a very pardonable fear of disgrace. They both\r\nreceived at the outset great proofs of their countrymen's goodwill, but\r\nfelt ashamed to remain as it were in their debt, and they ever strove to\r\nwipe out their obligations to the people by legislation on their behalf,\r\nand by their beneficent measures continually increased their popularity,\r\nuntil, in the heat of the rivalry thus created, they found themselves\r\npledged to a line of policy in which they could not even pause with\r\nhonour, and which they could not desist from without disgrace. The\r\nreader, however, will be able to form his own opinion about them from\r\ntheir history, and I shall now write, as a parallel to them, the lives\r\nof that pair of Laconian reformers, Agis and Kleomenes, kings of Sparta,\r\nwho, like the Gracchi, increased the power of the people, and\r\nendeavoured to restore an admirable and just constitution which had\r\nfallen into desuetude; but who, like them, incurred the hatred of the\r\ngoverning class, who were unwilling to relinquish their encroachments\r\nand privileges. These Lacedæmonians were not indeed brothers, yet they\r\npursued a kindred policy, with the same objects in view.\r\n\r\nIII. After the desire for silver and gold had penetrated into Sparta,\r\nthe acquisition of wealth produced greed and meanness, while the use and\r\nenjoyment of riches was followed by luxury, effeminacy, and\r\nextravagance. Thus it fell out that Sparta lost her high and honoured\r\nposition in Greece, and remained in obscurity and disgrace until the\r\nreign of Agis and Leonidas. Agis was of the Eurypontid line, the son of\r\nEudamidas, and the sixth in descent from king Agesilaus, who invaded\r\nAsia, and became the most powerful man in Greece. This Agesilaus had a\r\nson named Archidamus, who fell in battle against the Messapians at the\r\nbattle of Mandurium[1] in Italy. He was succeeded by his eldest son\r\nAgis, who, being killed by Antipater near Megalopolis, and leaving no\r\nissue, was succeeded by his brother, Eudamidas; he, by a son named\r\nArchidamus; and Archidamus by another Eudamidas, the father of Agis, the\r\nsubject of this memoir.\r\n\r\nLeonidas, the son of Kleonymus, was of the other royal family, that of\r\nthe Agiadæ, and was eighth in descent from Pausanias who conquered\r\nMardonius at the battle of Plataea. Pausanias had a son named\r\nPleistoanax, whose son was again named Pausanias. This Pausanias[2]\r\nfled for his life from Sparta to Tegea, and was succeeded by his eldest\r\nson Agesipolis; and he, dying childless, by his younger brother\r\nKleombrotus. Kleombrotus left two sons, Agesipolis and Kleomenes, of\r\nwhom Agesipolis reigned but a short time, and left no children.\r\nKleomenes succeeded his brother Agesipolis on the throne. Of his two\r\nsons, the elder, Akrotatus, died during his father's lifetime, and the\r\nyounger, Kleonymus, never reigned, as the throne was occupied by\r\nAreus[3] the grandson of Kleomenes, and the son of Akrotatus. Areus\r\nperished in battle before Corinth, and was succeeded by his son\r\nAkrotatus. This Akrotatus was defeated and slain near the city of\r\nMegalopolis by the despot Aristodemus, leaving his wife pregnant. When\r\nshe bore a son, Leonidas the son of Kleonymus was appointed his\r\nguardian, and, as the child died before reaching manhood, he succeeded\r\nto the throne although he was far from being an acceptable personage to\r\nhis countrymen; for, though the Spartans at this period had all\r\nabandoned their original severe simplicity of living, yet they found the\r\nmanners of Leonidas in offensive contrast to their own. Indeed,\r\nLeonidas, who had spent much of his life at the courts of Asiatic\r\npotentates, and had been especially attached to that of Seleukus, seemed\r\ninclined to outrage the political feeling of the Greeks by introducing\r\nthe arrogant tone of an Oriental despot into the constitutional monarchy\r\nof Sparta.\r\n\r\nIV. On the other hand, the goodness of heart and intellectual power of\r\nAgis proved so greatly superior not only to that of Leonidas, but of\r\nevery king since Agesilaus the Great, that before he arrived at his\r\ntwentieth year, in spite of his having been brought up in the greatest\r\nluxury by his mother Agesistrata and his grandmother Archidamia, the two\r\nrichest women in Sparta, he abjured all frivolous indulgence, laid aside\r\nall personal ornament, avoided extravagance of every kind, prided\r\nhimself on practising the old Laconian habits of dress, food, and\r\nbathing, and was wont to say that he would not care to be king unless\r\nhe could use his position to restore the ancient customs and discipline\r\nof his country.\r\n\r\nV. The corruption of the Lacedæmonians began at the time when, after\r\nhaving overthrown the Athenian empire, they were able to satiate\r\nthemselves with the possession of gold and silver. Nevertheless, as the\r\nnumber of houses instituted by Lykurgus was still maintained, and each\r\nfather still transmitted his estate to his son, the original equal\r\ndivision of property continued to exist and preserved the state from\r\ndisorder. But a certain powerful and self-willed man, named Epitadeus,\r\nwho was one of the Ephors, having quarrelled with his son, proposed a\r\nrhetra permitting a man to give his house and land to whomsoever he\r\npleased, either during his life, or by his will after his death. This\r\nman proposed the law in order to gratify his own private grudge; but the\r\nother Spartans through covetousness eagerly confirmed it, and ruined the\r\nadmirable constitution of Lykurgus. They now began to acquire land\r\nwithout limit, as the powerful men kept their relatives out of their\r\nrightful inheritance; and as the wealth of the country soon got into the\r\nhands of a few, the city became impoverished, and the rich began to be\r\nviewed with dislike and hatred. There were left at that time no more\r\nthan seven hundred Spartans, and of these about one hundred possessed an\r\ninheritance in land, while the rest, without money, and excluded from\r\nall the privileges of citizenship, fought in a languid and spiritless\r\nfashion in the wars, and were ever on the watch for some opportunity to\r\nsubvert the existing condition of affairs at home.\r\n\r\nVI. Agis, therefore, thinking that it would be an honourable enterprise,\r\nas indeed it was, to restore these citizens to the state and to\r\nre-establish equality for all, began to sound the people themselves as\r\nto their opinion about such a measure. The younger men quickly rallied\r\nround him, and, with an enthusiasm which he had hardly counted upon,\r\nbegan to make ready for the contest; but most of the elder men, who had\r\nbecome more thoroughly tainted by the prevailing corruption, feared to\r\nbe brought back to the discipline of Lykurgus as much as a runaway slave\r\nfears to be brought back to his master, and they bitterly reviled Agis\r\nwhen he lamented over the condition of affairs and sighed for the\r\nancient glories of Sparta. His enthusiastic aspirations, however, were\r\nsympathised with by Lysander the son of Libys, Mandrokleidas the son of\r\nEkphanes, and Agesilaus. Lysander was the most influential of all the\r\nSpartans, while Mandrokleidas was thought to be the ablest politician in\r\nGreece, as he could both plot with subtlety and execute with boldness.\r\nAgesilaus was the uncle of King Agis and a fluent speaker, but of a weak\r\nand covetous disposition. It was commonly supposed that he was stirred\r\nto action by the influence of his son Hippomedon, who had gained great\r\nglory in the wars and was exceedingly popular among the younger\r\ncitizens; but what really determined him to join the reformers was the\r\namount of his debts, which he hoped would be wiped out by a revolution.\r\nAs soon as Agis had won over this important adherent, he began to try to\r\nbring over his mother to his views, who was Agesilaus's sister, and who,\r\nfrom the number of her friends, debtors, and dependants, was very\r\npowerful in the state, and took a large share in the management of\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nVII. When she first heard of Agis's designs she was much startled, and\r\ndissuaded the youth from an enterprise which she thought neither\r\npracticable nor desirable. However, when Agesilaus pointed out to her\r\nwhat a notable design it was, and how greatly to the advantage of all,\r\nwhile the young king himself besought his mother to part with her wealth\r\nin order to gain him glory, arguing that he could not vie with other\r\nkings in riches, as the servants of Persian satraps, and the very slaves\r\nof the intendants of Ptolemy and Seleukus possessed more money than all\r\nthe kings that ever reigned in Sparta; but that, if he could prove\r\nhimself superior to those vanities by his temperance, simplicity of\r\nlife, and true greatness of mind, and could succeed in restoring\r\nequality among his fellow-countrymen, he would be honoured and renowned\r\nas a truly great king. By this means the youth entirely changed his\r\nmother's mind, and so fired her with his own ambition, as if by an\r\ninspiration from heaven, that she began to encourage Agis and urge him\r\non, and invited her friends to join them, while she also communicated\r\ntheir design to the other women, because she knew that the Lacedæmonians\r\nwere in all things ruled by their women, and that they had more power in\r\nthe state than the men possessed in their private households. Most of\r\nthe wealth of Lacedæmon had fallen into female hands at this time, and\r\nthis fact proved a great hindrance to the accomplishment of Agis's\r\nschemes of reform; for the women offered a vehement opposition to him,\r\nnot merely through a vulgar love for their idolised luxury, but also\r\nbecause they saw that they would lose all the influence and power which\r\nthey derived from their wealth. They betook themselves to Leonidas, and\r\nbesought him, as being the elder man, to restrain Agis, and check the\r\ndevelopment of his designs. Leonidas was willing enough to assist the\r\nricher class, but he feared the people, who were eager for reform, and\r\nwould not openly oppose Agis, although he endeavoured secretly to ruin\r\nhis scheme, and to prejudice the Ephors against him, by imputing to him\r\nthe design of hiring the poor to make him despot with the plunder of the\r\nrich, and insinuating that by his redistribution of lands and remission\r\nof debts he meant to obtain more adherents for himself instead of more\r\ncitizens for Sparta.\r\n\r\nVIII. In spite of all this, Agis contrived to get Lysander appointed one\r\nof the Ephors, and immediately brought him to propose a rhetra before\r\nthe Gerusia, or Senate, the main points of which were that all debts\r\nshould be cancelled; that the land[4] should be divided, that between\r\nthe valley of Pellene and Mount Taygetus, Malea, and Sellasia into four\r\nthousand five hundred lots, and the outlying districts into fifteen\r\nthousand: that the latter district should be distributed among the\r\nPerioeki of military age, and the former among the pure Spartans: that\r\nthe number of these should be made up by an extension of the franchise\r\nto Perioeki or even foreigners of free birth, liberal education, and\r\nfitting personal qualifications: and that these citizens should be\r\ndivided into fifteen companies some of four hundred, and some of two\r\nhundred, for the public meals, and should conform in every respect to\r\nthe discipline of their forefathers.\r\n\r\nIX. When this rhetra was proposed, as the Senate could not agree\r\nwhether it should become law, Lysander convoked a popular assembly and\r\nhimself addressed the people. Mandrokleidas and Agesilaus also besought\r\nthem not to allow a few selfish voluptuaries to destroy the glorious\r\nname of Sparta, but to remember the ancient oracles, warning them\r\nagainst the sin of covetousness, which would prove the ruin of Sparta,\r\nand also of the responses which they had recently received from the\r\noracle of Pasiphae. The temple and oracle of Pasiphae at Thalamae was of\r\npeculiar sanctity. Pasiphae is said by some writers to have been one of\r\nthe daughters of Atlas, and to have become the mother of Ammon by Zeus,\r\nwhile others say that Kassandra the daughter of Priam died there, and\r\nwas called Pasiphae because her prophecies were plain to all men.\r\nPhylarchus again tells us that Daphne the daughter of Amyklas, while\r\nendeavouring to escape from the violence of Apollo, was transformed into\r\nthe laurel,[5] which bears her name, and was honoured by the god and\r\nendowed by him with the gift of prophecy. Be this as it may, the\r\noracular responses which were brought from this shrine bade the Spartans\r\nall become equal according as Lykurgus had originally ordained. After\r\nthese speeches had been delivered, King Agis himself came forward, and,\r\nafter a few introductory words, said that he was giving the strongest\r\npossible pledges of his loyalty to the new constitution; for he declared\r\nhis intention of surrendering to the state, before any one else, his own\r\nproperty, consisting of a vast extent of land, both arable and pasture,\r\nbesides six thousand talents of money; and he assured the people that\r\nhis mother and her friends, the richest people in Sparta, would do the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nX. The people were astounded at the magnanimity of the youth, and were\r\nfilled with joy, thinking that at last, after an interval of three\r\nhundred years, there had appeared a king worthy of Sparta. Leonidas, on\r\nthe other hand, opposed him as vigorously as he could, reflecting that\r\nhe would be forced to follow his example, and divest himself of all his\r\nproperty, and that Agis, not he, would get the credit of the act. He\r\ntherefore inquired of Agis whether he thought Lykurgus to have been a\r\njust and well-meaning man. Receiving an affirmative reply, he again\r\ndemanded, \"Where, then, do we find that Lykurgus approved of the\r\ncancelling of debts, or of the admission of foreigners to the franchise,\r\nseeing that he did not think that the state could prosper without a\r\nperiodical expulsion of foreigners?\" To this Agis answered, that it was\r\nnot to be wondered at if Leonidas, who had lived in a foreign country,\r\nand had a family by the daughter of a Persian satrap, should be ignorant\r\nthat Lykurgus, together with coined money, had banished borrowing and\r\nlending from Sparta, and that he had no hatred for foreigners, but only\r\nfor those whose profession and mode of life made them unfit to associate\r\nwith his countrymen. These men Lykurgus expelled, not from any hatred of\r\ntheir persons, but because he feared that their manners and habits would\r\ninfect the citizens with a love of luxury, effeminacy, and avarice.\r\nTerpander, Thales, and Pherekydes were all foreigners, but, since they\r\nsang and taught what Lykurgus approved, they lived in Sparta, and were\r\ntreated with especial honour. \"Do you,\" asked he, \"praise Ekprepus, who\r\nwhen Ephor cut off with a hatchet the two additional strings which\r\nPhrynis the musician had added to the original seven strings of the\r\nlyre, and those who cut the same strings off the harp of Timotheus, and\r\nyet do you blame us when we are endeavouring to get rid of luxury,\r\nextravagance, and frivolity, just as if those great men did not merely\r\nmean thereby to guard against vain refinements of music, which would\r\nlead to the introduction of extravagant and licentious manners, and\r\ncause the city to be at discord and variance with itself?\"\r\n\r\nXI. After this the people espoused the cause of Agis, while the rich\r\nbegged Leonidas not to desert them, and by their entreaties prevailed\r\nupon the senators, who had the power of originating all laws, to throw\r\nout the rhetra by a majority of only one vote. Lysander, who was still\r\none of the Ephors, now proceeded to attack Leonidas, by means of a\r\ncertain ancient law, which forbade any descendant of Herakles to beget\r\nchildren by a foreign wife, and which bade the Spartans put to death any\r\ncitizen who left his country to dwell in a foreign land. He instructed\r\nhis adherents to revive the memory of this law, and threaten Leonidas\r\nwith its penalties, while he himself with the other Ephors watched for\r\nthe sign from heaven. This ceremony is conducted as follows:--Every ninth\r\nyear the Ephors choose a clear moonless night, and sit in silence\r\nwatching the heavens. If a star shoots across the sky, they conclude\r\nthat the kings must have committed some act of impiety, and they suspend\r\nthem from their office, until they were absolved by a favourable oracle\r\nfrom Delphi or Olympia. Lysander now declared that he had beheld this\r\nsign, and impeached Leonidas, bringing forward witnesses to prove that\r\nhe had two children born to him by an Asiatic wife, the daughter of one\r\nof the lieutenants of Seleukus, and that having quarrelled with his wife\r\nand become hated by her he had unexpectedly returned home, and in\r\ndefault of a direct heir, had succeeded to the throne. At the same time\r\nLysander urged Kleombrotus, the son-in-law of Leonidas, who was also of\r\nthe royal family, to claim the throne for himself. Leonidas, terrified\r\nat this, took sanctuary in the temple of Athena of the Brazen House, and\r\nwas joined there by his daughter, who left her husband Kleombrotus. When\r\nthe trial came on, Leonidas did not appear in court, he was removed from\r\nthe throne, and Kleombrotus was appointed in his stead.\r\n\r\nXII. At this crisis Lysander was forced to lay down his office, as the\r\nyear for which he had been elected had expired. The Ephors at once took\r\nLeonidas under their protection, restored him to the throne, and\r\nimpeached Lysander and Mandrokleidas as the authors of illegal measures\r\nin the cancelling of debts and the redistribution of the land. As these\r\nmen were now in danger of their lives, they prevailed upon the two kings\r\nto act together and overrule the decision of the Ephors; for this, they\r\ndeclared, was the ancient rule of the constitution, that if the kings\r\nwere at variance, the Ephors were entitled to support the one whom they\r\njudged to be in the right against the other, but their function was\r\nmerely to act as arbitrators and judges between the kings when they\r\ndisagreed, and not to interfere with them when they were of one mind.\r\nBoth the kings agreed to act upon this advice, and came with their\r\nfriends into the assembly, turned the Ephors out of their chairs of\r\noffice, and elected others in their room, one of whom was Agesilaus.\r\nThey now armed many of the younger citizens, released the prisoners, and\r\nterrified their opponents by threatening a general massacre. No one,\r\nhowever, was killed by them; for although Agesilaus desired to kill\r\nLeonidas, and when he withdrew from Sparta to Tegea, sent men to waylay\r\nand murder him on the road, Agis, hearing of his intention, sent others\r\non whom he could rely, who escorted Leonidas safely as far as Tegea.\r\n\r\nXIII. Thus far all had gone well, and no one remained to hinder the\r\naccomplishment of the reforms; but now Agesilaus alone upset and ruined\r\nthe whole of this noble and truly Spartan scheme by his detestable vice\r\nof covetousness. He possessed a large quantity of the best land in the\r\ncountry, and also owed a great sum of money, and as he desired neither\r\nto pay his debts nor to part with his land, he persuaded Agis that it\r\nwould be too revolutionary a proceeding to carry both measures at once,\r\nand that, if the moneyed class were first propitiated by the cancelling\r\nof debts, they would afterwards be inclined to submit quietly to the\r\nredistribution of lands. Lysander and the rest were deceived by\r\nAgesilaus into consenting to this, and they brought all the written\r\nsecurities for money which had been given by debtors, which are called\r\nby them _klaria_, into the market-place, collected them into one heap,\r\nand burned them. As the flames rose up, the rich and those who had lent\r\nmoney went away in great distress, but Agesilaus, as if exulting at\r\ntheir misfortune, declared that he had never seen a brighter blaze or a\r\npurer fire. As the people at once demanded the division of the land, and\r\ncalled upon the kings to distribute it among them, Agesilaus put them\r\noff with various excuses, and managed to spin out the time till Agis was\r\nsent out of the country on military service, as the Achæans, who were\r\nallies, had demanded a reinforcement from Sparta, because the Ætolians\r\nthreatened to invade Peloponnesus through the territory of Megara, and\r\nAratus, the general of the Achæans, who was collecting an army to resist\r\nthem, sent to Sparta demanding assistance.\r\n\r\nXIV. The Spartans at once despatched Agis at the head of an army, whose\r\nhigh spirits and devotion to his person filled him with delight. The men\r\nwere nearly all young and poor; and as they were now relieved from the\r\npressure of their debts, and expected that on their return the land\r\nwould be distributed amongst them, they behaved with the most admirable\r\ndiscipline. They marched through Peloponnesus without doing the least\r\ndamage, without offending any one, almost without noise; so that all the\r\ncities were astonished at the spectacle thus afforded them, and men\r\nbegan to wonder what a Lacedæmonian army must have been like when led by\r\nAgesilaus or Lysander the Great, or by the ancient hero Leonidas, if\r\nsuch awe and reverence was paid by the soldiers to one who was nearly\r\nthe youngest of them all. Their youthful leader himself was worthy of\r\nadmiration, and was looked up to by the men because of his simple\r\nhard-working habits, and the pride which he took in wearing the same\r\ndress and using the same arms as the common soldiers. The revolution\r\nwhich he had effected, however, was very distasteful to the rich, who\r\nfeared lest it might be taken as an example by the people in other\r\nstates and lead to further disturbances.\r\n\r\nXV. Agis joined Aratus at Corinth, while the question of how to repel\r\nthe invasion was still being debated. His advice was spirited, without\r\nbeing rash or foolhardy. He gave it as his opinion that it was their\r\nduty to fight, and not abandon the gate of Peloponnesus and let the\r\nenemy into the country, but that he would defer to the decision of\r\nAratus, who was an older man than himself, and was the general of the\r\nAchæans, and that he had not come to give them advice or to take the\r\ncommand of them, but to reinforce them and serve as their ally. The\r\nhistorian Baton of Sinope declares that Agis declined to fight although\r\nAratus wished him to do so; but he is mistaken, and clearly has not read\r\nthe justification which Aratus has written of his conduct, namely, that\r\nas the farmers had nearly all finished gathering in their harvest, he\r\nthought it better to allow the enemy to enter the country than to hazard\r\neverything upon the issue of a single battle. As Aratus decided not to\r\nfight, and dismissed his allies with thanks, Agis returned home,\r\ngreatly honoured by those under his orders, and found the internal\r\naffairs of Sparta in great turmoil and confusion.\r\n\r\nXVI. Agesilaus, who was now Ephor, and who was no longer restrained by\r\nthe presence of those of whom he had formerly stood in awe, was using\r\nthe most disgraceful expedients to extort money from the people, and had\r\neven intercalated a thirteenth month in the year, although the state of\r\nthe calendar did not require it, and caused taxes to be paid for it. As\r\nhe feared those whom he had wronged, and was an object of universal\r\nhatred, he had taken a bodyguard of swordsmen into his pay, and walked\r\nthrough the city accompanied by them. As for the kings, he regarded\r\nKleombrotus with contempt, and though he still paid some respect to\r\nAgis, he wished it to be thought that he did so because he was nearly\r\nrelated to himself, not because he was king. He also gave out that he\r\nintended to remain in office as Ephor for the next year as well. In\r\nconsequence of this his enemies determined to bring matters to a crisis.\r\nThey assembled in force, brought back Leonidas publicly from Tegea, and\r\nreinstated him as king, to the great joy of most of the citizens, who\r\nwere angry with the other party because they had been deceived by them\r\nabout the redistribution of the land. Agesilaus was able to leave the\r\ncountry in safety, owing to the intercession of his son Hippomedon, who\r\nwas very popular with all classes on account of his bravery. Of the two\r\nkings, Agis fled to the temple of Athena of the Brazen House, while\r\nKleombrotus took sanctuary in the temple of Poseidon.[6] It appeared\r\nthat Leonidas hated Kleombrotus most of the two; for he passed by Agis,\r\nbut marched in pursuit of Kleombrotus with an armed force, and angrily\r\nreproached him that being his own son-in-law he had conspired against\r\nhim, dethroned him, and driven him into exile.\r\n\r\nXVII. Kleombrotus could find nothing to say in his defence, and sat\r\nsilent and helpless; but Chilonis, the daughter of Leonidas, who\r\nformerly had taken offence at her father's injurious treatment, and when\r\nKleombrotus usurped the throne had left him, and showed her sympathy\r\nwith Leonidas in his misfortune by accompanying him in the temple where\r\nhe took sanctuary, and after he left the country by mourning for him and\r\nremaining at variance with her husband Kleombrotus, now changed sides\r\nwith his changing fortunes, and appeared sitting by her husband's side\r\nas a suppliant to the god with him, with her arms cast round him, and\r\nher two children on each side of her. All stood amazed and were moved to\r\ntears by her noble and affectionate conduct, and she, pointing to her\r\nmean dress and dishevelled hair, said, \"Father, I have not adopted this\r\nposture and this dress out of pity for Kleombrotus, but I have so long\r\nbeen in mourning for your misfortunes and your banishment that it has\r\nbecome customary with me. Am I now to remain in mourning while you are\r\nvictorious and reign in Sparta, or am I to dress myself in fine clothes\r\nas becomes a princess, while I see my husband murdered by your hand?\r\nUnless he can move you to compassion, and obtain your pity by the tears\r\nof his wife and children, he will suffer a more terrible penalty for his\r\nmisconduct than you wish to impose, by seeing me his dearest wife die\r\nbefore him; for how can I endure to live among other women, if I prove\r\nunable to move either my husband or my father to compassion? Both as a\r\nwife and as a daughter I have been fated to suffer with my own kin and\r\nto be despised with them. If there is anything which can be urged on\r\nbehalf of my husband's conduct, I have made it impossible to plead it\r\nfor him by the part which I have taken in protesting against his conduct\r\nto you; but you yourself suggest a sufficient apology for his crime, by\r\nshowing that you think royalty so great and precious a thing, that to\r\nobtain it you are willing to murder your son-in-law and neglect your own\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\nXVIII. Chilonis, after speaking thus, nestled her face against that of\r\nher husband, and glanced round at the spectators with red and tearful\r\neyes. Leonidas, after a short consultation with his friends, bade\r\nKleombrotus rise and leave the country, but besought his daughter to\r\nremain with him, and not to leave him who loved her so dearly, and had\r\njust spared her husband's life in consequence of her entreaties. He\r\ncould not, however, prevail upon her to stay, but she rose up with her\r\nhusband, took one child in her arms, and led the other, and so, after\r\nkneeling before the altar, followed her husband, who, if his mind was\r\nnot entirely corrupted by vain ambition, must have thought exile with\r\nsuch a wife preferable to royalty. After driving Kleombrotus from the\r\nthrone, ejecting the Ephors from office and substituting others chosen\r\nby himself, Leonidas addressed himself to Agis. At first he tried to\r\npersuade him to come out of sanctuary and reign as his colleague, saying\r\nthat the citizens had forgiven him, because they knew that he was young\r\nand impetuous, and had been deceived by Agesilaus. However, as Agis saw\r\nthrough these devices and remained where he was, Leonidas left off\r\nmaking these hypocritical offers. Amphares, Damochares, and Arkesilaus\r\nwere in the habit of going to the temple and conversing with him; and\r\nonce he came out of the temple in their company to take a bath, and\r\nafter bathing was conducted back again by them in safety. All three were\r\non intimate terms with him, but Amphares, who had lately borrowed some\r\nrich clothing and valuable plate from Agesistrata, was inclined to plot\r\nagainst the king and the royal ladies, that he might not be obliged to\r\nrestore them. He, therefore, we are told, lent a ready ear to Leonidas's\r\nplans, and excited the zeal of the Ephors, one of whom he was.\r\n\r\nXIX. Since Agis lived entirely in the temple, and only left it in order\r\nto bathe, they determined to seize him when he came out for this\r\npurpose. Having one day watched him bathing they came up and greeted him\r\nin a friendly way, and walked along with him talking and jesting as\r\nyoung men who are on intimate terms are wont to do. When they reached\r\nthe place where a road branches off to the public prison, Amphares, in\r\nvirtue of his Ephorship, laid hold of Agis and said: \"Agis, I must lead\r\nyou before the Ephors to give an account of your conduct.\" At the same\r\ntime Damochares, a tall and strong man, threw his cloak round Agis's\r\nneck and dragged him along by it. Others now appeared by previous\r\narrangement, and pushed him from behind, and as no one came to help\r\nhim, he was forced into the prison. Hereupon, Leonidas appeared with a\r\nband of mercenaries, and surrounded the prison. The Ephors now went in\r\nto Agis, and sent for all the senators of their way of thinking to come\r\nto the prison in order to go through the form of a trial. Agis laughed\r\nat their hypocrisy, but Amphares told him that it was no laughing\r\nmatter, and that he would soon pay a bitter penalty for his rashness.\r\nAnother of the Ephors, wishing to offer a means of escape to Agis,\r\ninquired of him whether he had acted on his own responsibility, or had\r\nbeen compelled to do so by Agesilaus and Lysander. Agis answered that no\r\nman had compelled him, but that he admired and imitated Lykurgus, and\r\nhad aimed at reviving his institutions. Upon this the same Ephor asked\r\nhim whether he repented of what he had done. When the brave youth\r\nanswered that he never would repent of his glorious designs, whatever\r\ntortures he might have to suffer for them, the assembly at once\r\ncondemned him to death, and bade the prison officials at once remove him\r\nto the place called Dechas, which is a part of the prison in which\r\ncriminals are strangled. Seeing that the servants would not lay hands\r\nupon Agis, and that even those mercenaries who were present shrunk from\r\nsuch work, because it was held to be unlawful and impious to lay hands\r\nupon the person of the king, Damochares, after threatening and abusing\r\nthem, dragged Agis with his own hands to the place of execution. Many of\r\nthe citizens had by this time heard of his arrest, and many men had\r\nassembled with torches in their hands and were clamouring at the gate of\r\nthe prison. The mother and grandmother of Agis were also present, and\r\nloudly demanded that the king of Sparta should have a fair trial in the\r\npresence of his countrymen. For this reason they within hurried on the\r\nexecution, as they feared that if a larger crowd collected Agis would be\r\nrescued during the night.\r\n\r\nXX. While Agis was being led to execution, he saw one of the servants of\r\nthe prison weeping and in great distress. \"My man,\" said he, \"do not\r\nweep for me, for I am a better man than those who are murdering me in\r\nthis cruel and illegal fashion.\" With these words he, of his own\r\naccord, put the noose round his neck. Meanwhile Amphares proceeded to\r\nthe prison gate. Here Agesistrata fell at his feet, believing him still\r\nto be her friend. Amphares raised her, saying that Agis would suffer no\r\nviolent treatment, and bade her, if she wished, go in and see her son.\r\nAs she asked to be accompanied by her mother, Amphares said that there\r\nwas no objection to that, and after receiving them both within the\r\nwalls, ordered the prison gates to be closed. He first sent Archidamia,\r\nwho was now very old, and greatly respected by her countrywomen, to the\r\nplace of execution, and when she was dead, bade Agesistrata enter. When\r\nshe saw the corpse of her son lying on the ground, and her mother\r\nhanging by a halter, she herself assisted the servants to take her down,\r\nlaid her body beside that of Agis, and arranged and covered up the two\r\ncorpses. She then knelt and kissed the face of her son, saying, \"My\r\nchild, thy great piety, goodness, and clemency has brought thee and us\r\nto this death.\" Upon this Amphares, who was watching and listening at\r\nthe door, came into the room, and said angrily to Agesistrata, \"If you\r\napprove of your son's deeds, you shall suffer with him.\" At these words\r\nAgesistrata rose and offered her neck to the halter, saying, \"I only\r\npray that this may be for the good of Sparta.\"\r\n\r\nXXI. When the sad news was known throughout the city, and the three\r\ncorpses brought out of the prison, the terror which was inspired did not\r\nprevent the citizens from manifesting their sorrow at the deed, and\r\ntheir hatred of Leonidas and Amphares. No such wicked or cruel deed,\r\nthey declared, had been committed in Sparta since the Dorians settled in\r\nPeloponnesus. The very enemies of the Lacedæmonians generally seemed\r\nunwilling to lay violent hands on their kings when they met them in\r\nbattle, and turned aside through reverence of their exalted position.\r\nFor this reason, in all the battles which the Lacedæmonians had fought\r\nagainst the Greeks before the era of Philip of Macedon, only one king,\r\nKleombrotus, had fallen on the field of Leuktra; for though the\r\nMessenians aver that Theopompus, a king of Lacedæmon, was slain by\r\nAristomenes, the Lacedæmonians deny it, and say that he was only\r\nwounded. This matter is doubtful, but Agis was the first king who was\r\nput to death by the Ephors in Lacedæmon, because he had conceived a\r\nnoble design and one which was worthy of Sparta. He was of an age when\r\nmen's shortcomings deserve to be pardoned; and deserves to be blamed by\r\nhis friends more than by his enemies, because with an ill-judged\r\nclemency he spared the life of Leonidas, and trusted in the professions\r\nof the rest of his political enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF KLEOMENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. After the death of Agis, as has been related, Leonidas was not able\r\nto seize the person of his brother Archidamus, who at once fled out of\r\nthe country, but he brought the wife of Agis with her newly-born child\r\nout of her house, and forcibly married her to his own son Kleomenes, who\r\nwas scarcely come to an age for marriage, because he was unwilling for\r\nher to marry any one else. Indeed Agiatis was the daughter of Gylippus,\r\nand heiress to a great estate. She was thought to be the most beautiful\r\nwoman of her time in all Greece, and was of a noble disposition. It is\r\nsaid that she made many entreaties not to be forced into a second\r\nmarriage, but that after her union with Kleomenes, although she\r\ncontinued to hate his father Leonidas, she made a good and affectionate\r\nwife to the young man, who became passionately fond of her, and\r\nsympathised with her loving remembrance of Agis, so that he would often\r\nask her to tell him about her late husband, and used to listen with rapt\r\nattention while she explained the designs and projects of Agis. For\r\nKleomenes was as eager for honour, and had as noble a mind as Agis\r\nhimself, and was equally moderate and simple in his way of life; but he\r\nlacked the other's discreet and gentle temper, and was of a stirring and\r\nvehement nature, eager to embark on any honourable enterprise. He\r\nthought it the most glorious position of all to rule over an obedient\r\npeople; but he took pride also in bending disobedient subjects to his\r\nwill, and forcibly compelling them to move in the path of honour.\r\n\r\nII. He was far from satisfied with the state of things at Sparta, where\r\nthe citizens had given themselves up to luxurious repose, while the king\r\nLeonidas cared nothing for public affairs, so long as he was able to\r\ngratify his own love of extravagance and self-indulgence. Public virtue\r\nwas entirely gone, and no man cared to profit his country, but only\r\nhimself. As for discipline, orderly training of the young, hardiness of\r\nbody, and equality, all these things had perished with Agis, and it was\r\nnot safe even to speak of them. We are told that while yet a lad\r\nKleomenes was instructed in the principles of the Stoic philosophy by\r\nSphærus of Borysthenes,[7] who visited Lacedæmon and gave excellent\r\ninstruction there to the young. This Sphærus was one of the aptest\r\npupils of Zeno of Kitium,[8] and he seems to have admired the manly\r\nspirit of Kleomenes and to have encouraged him in the pursuit of honour.\r\nThe ancient hero Leonidas, when asked what he thought of Tyrtæus, is\r\nsaid to have answered, \"He is good at exciting the minds of the youth.\"\r\nIndeed they became filled with enthusiasm by the poems of Tyrtæus, and\r\nfought with reckless daring in battle: and so also the Stoic philosophy\r\noften renders brave and fiery natures over-daring and venturesome, and\r\nyields the best fruit when applied to a grave and gentle nature.\r\n\r\nIII. When after the death of Leonidas, Kleomenes succeeded to the\r\nthrone, he found the state utterly disorganised, for the rich took no\r\npart in politics, and cared for nothing but their own pleasure and\r\nprofit, while the miserable condition of the poor caused them to fight\r\nwithout spirit in the wars, and to neglect the proper training of their\r\nchildren. He himself was a king only in name, as the Ephors had\r\nengrossed all real power. Under these circumstances he at once began to\r\nrevolve schemes of reform in his mind, and began to sound the opinion of\r\nhis intimate friend Xenares, by enquiring of him what sort of a king\r\nAgis had been, and in what manner, and with what associates he had made\r\nhis attempts at reform. Xenares at first very willingly gave him a\r\ncomplete narrative of the whole transaction; but as he saw that\r\nKleomenes listened with intense interest, and was deeply excited by the\r\nrecital of Agis's designs, to which he was never weary of listening,\r\nXenares at last angrily reproached him with not being in his right mind,\r\nand at last broke off all intercourse with him. He did not, however,\r\ntell any one the reason of their being at variance, but declared that\r\nKleomenes knew well what it was. Kleomenes, after meeting with this\r\nrebuff from Xenares, imagining that every one else would be of the same\r\nmind, determined to concert his own measures alone. As he thought that\r\nthere was more chance of effecting reforms during war than in time of\r\npeace, he involved Sparta in a war with the Achæans, for which they\r\nthemselves furnished the pretext. Aratus, the chief of the Achæans, had\r\nalways desired to unite the whole of the Peloponnesus in one\r\nconfederacy, and in all his long political career had steadily kept this\r\nobject in view, as he thought that thus, and thus alone, the people of\r\nPeloponnesus would be able to defend themselves against external foes.\r\nNearly all the tribes of Peloponnesus joined his confederacy except the\r\nLacedæmonians, the people of Elis, and such of the Arcadians as were\r\nunder Lacedæmonian influence. On the death of Leonidas, Aratus began to\r\nmake plundering expeditions into the territory of the Arcadians,\r\nespecially those near the Achæan frontier, in order to see what steps\r\nthe Lacedæmonians would take; for he despised Kleomenes as a young and\r\ninexperienced man.\r\n\r\nIV. Upon this the Ephors first sent Kleomenes to occupy the temple of\r\nAthena, near Belbina. This place was situated in a mountain pass leading\r\ninto Laconia, and it was claimed by the citizens of Megalopolis as\r\nbelonging to their territory. Kleomenes seized the pass and fortified\r\nit, to which Aratus offered no objection, but endeavoured by a night\r\nmarch to surprise the cities of Tegea and Orchomenes. However, the\r\nhearts of the traitors within the walls failed them, and so Aratus led\r\nhis army back, hoping that his object had not been discovered.\r\nKleomenes, by way of jest, now wrote him a letter affecting to enquire\r\nof him in the most friendly terms where he had been to in the night. He\r\nanswered that he had heard that Kleomenes was about to erect\r\nfortifications at Belbina, and had marched to prevent his doing so. To\r\nthis Kleomenes answered that he was satisfied that this had been\r\nAratus's intention. \"But,\" he continued, \"if you do not mind, please\r\ntell me why you brought scaling ladders and torches with you.\" Aratus\r\nlaughed at this home-thrust, and enquired what sort of a youth Kleomenes\r\nmight be. Damochares, the Lacedæmonian exile, answered, \"If you mean to\r\ndo anything against the Lacedæmonians, you must make haste and do it\r\nbefore this young gamecock's spurs are grown.\" After this the Ephors\r\nordered Kleomenes, who was encamped in Arcadia with a few horsemen and\r\nthree hundred foot, to retire, as they feared to go to war. But since,\r\nas soon as he had withdrawn, Aratus captured the city of Kaphyæ, they\r\nsent him back again. He captured Methydrium, and overran Argolis, upon\r\nwhich the Achæans sent an army of twenty thousand foot and a thousand\r\nhorse, under the command of Aristomachus, to attack him. Kleomenes met\r\nthem near Pallantium, and was eager to fight, but Aratus, alarmed at his\r\ndaring, would not permit the Achæan general to fight, and drew off his\r\nforces, incurring thereby the anger of the Achæans, and the ridicule and\r\ncontempt of the Lacedæmonians, who only amounted to one-fifth of the\r\nenemy's numbers. This affair gave Kleomenes great self-confidence, and\r\nparodying a saying of one of the ancient kings, he said to his\r\ncountrymen that it was useless nowadays for the Lacedæmonians to ask\r\neither how many their enemies were, or where they were.[9]\r\n\r\nV. Shortly after, as the Achæans were making war against the Eleans,\r\nKleomenes was sent to aid the latter, and met with the army of the\r\nAchæans returning home, near the mountain called Lykæum. He attacked\r\ntheir forces, and utterly routed them, killing many and capturing\r\nnumbers of prisoners, so that a report spread throughout Greece that\r\nAratus himself had perished. But Aratus, turning the disaster to good\r\naccount, immediately after the defeat marched to Mantinea, and as no\r\none expected him, captured the city and placed a strong garrison in it.\r\nThis completely disheartened the Lacedæmonians, who desired to recall\r\nKleomenes and put an end to the war. Kleomenes now sent to Messene and\r\ninvited back Archidamus, the brother of Agis, who ought to have been on\r\nthe throne as the representative of the other royal family, imagining\r\nthat if there were two kings reigning at Sparta at the same time, the\r\npower of the Ephors would be weakened. However, the party who had\r\npreviously murdered Agis perceived this, and as they feared that if\r\nArchidamus returned to Sparta he would make them pay the penalty of\r\ntheir crimes, they welcomed him back and assisted him to make a secret\r\nentry into the city, but immediately afterwards assassinated him, either\r\nagainst the will of Kleomenes, as we are told by Phylarchus, or else\r\nwith his connivance, in consequence of the representations of his\r\nfriends. They indeed bore the chief blame in the matter, as they were\r\nthought to have forced Kleomenes into consenting to the murder.\r\n\r\nVI. Kleomenes, determined to carry out his designs of reform, now\r\nproceeded to bribe the Ephors into sending him out on a new military\r\nexpedition. He also won over a considerable number of supporters among\r\nthe citizens by means of the lavish expenditure and influence of his\r\nmother Kratesiklea, who, though averse to a second marriage, is said to\r\nhave married one of the leading men in Sparta in order to further her\r\nson's interests.\r\n\r\nKleomenes now took the field at the head of his army, and captured a\r\nsmall town within the territory of Megalopolis, named Leuktra.[10] The\r\nAchæans under Aratus promptly came up, and a battle was fought under the\r\nwalls of the town, in which part of the army of Kleomenes was defeated.\r\nAratus however refused to follow up his advantage, and kept the main\r\nbody of the Achæans motionless behind the bed of a torrent. Enraged at\r\nhis inaction, Lydiades of Megalopolis charged at the head of the cavalry\r\nunder his own command, but got entangled in the pursuit of the enemy in\r\nground which was cut up by walls and watercourses. Seeing him thrown\r\ninto disorder, Kleomenes sent his Tarentine and Cretan troops to attack\r\nhim, by whom Lydiades, fighting bravely, was overpowered and slain. The\r\nLacedæmonians now recovered their spirits, and with loud shouts attacked\r\nthe Achæans and completely defeated them. Many were slain, and their\r\ncorpses were given up to the enemy for burial, with the exception of\r\nthat of Lydiades, which Kleomenes ordered to be brought to himself. He\r\nthen attired it in a purple robe, placed a garland upon its head, and\r\nsent it to the city of Megalopolis. This was that Lydiades who had been\r\ndespot of Megalopolis, but who abdicated his throne, restored liberty to\r\nhis countrymen, and brought the city to join the Achæan league.\r\n\r\nVII. After this victory Kleomenes became inspired with fresh confidence,\r\nand was convinced that if he only were allowed undisputed management he\r\nwould easily conquer the Achæans. He explained to his step-father\r\nMegistonous that the time had at length come for the abolition of the\r\nEphors, the redistribution of property, and the establishment of\r\nequality among the citizens, after which Sparta might again aspire to\r\nrecover her ancient ascendancy in Greece. Megistonous agreed, and\r\ncommunicated his intentions to two or three of his friends. It chanced\r\nthat at this time one of the Ephors who was sleeping in the temple of\r\nPasiphæ dreamed an extraordinary dream, that in the place where the\r\nEphors sat for the dispatch of business he saw four chairs removed, and\r\none alone remaining, while as he wondered he heard a voice from the\r\nshrine say \"This is best for Sparta.\" When the Ephor related this dream\r\nto Kleomenes, he was at first much alarmed, and feared that the man had\r\nconceived some suspicion of his designs, but finding that he was really\r\nin earnest recovered his confidence. Taking with him all those citizens\r\nwhom he suspected to be opposed to his enterprise, he captured Heræa and\r\nAlsæa, cities belonging to the Achæan league, revictualled Orchomenus,\r\nand threatened Mantinea. By long marches and counter-marches he so\r\nwearied the Lacedæmonians that at last at their own request he left the\r\ngreater part of them in Arcadia, while he with the mercenaries returned\r\nto Sparta. During his homeward march he revealed his intentions to\r\nthose whom he considered to be most devoted to his person, and regulated\r\nhis march so as to be able to fall upon the Ephors while they were at\r\ntheir evening meal.\r\n\r\nVIII. When he drew near to the city, he sent Eurykleidas into the\r\ndining-room of the Ephors, on the pretence of bringing a message from\r\nthe army. After Eurykleidas followed Phoebis and Therukion, two of the\r\nfoster-brothers of Kleomenes, called _mothakes_[11] by the\r\nLacedæmonians, with a few soldiers. While Eurykleidas was parleying with\r\nthe Ephors, these men rushed in with drawn swords and cut them down. The\r\npresident, Agylæus, fell at the first blow and appeared to be dead, but\r\ncontrived to crawl out of the building unobserved into a small temple,\r\nsacred to Fear, the door of which was usually closed, but which then\r\nchanced to be open. In this he took refuge and shut the door. The other\r\nfour were slain, and some few persons, not more than ten, who came to\r\nassist them. No one who remained quiet was put to death, nor was any one\r\nprevented from leaving the city. Even Agylæus, when he came out of his\r\nsanctuary on the following day, was not molested.\r\n\r\nIX. The Lacedæmonians have temples dedicated not only to Fear, but to\r\nDeath, and Laughter, and the like. They honour Fear, not as a malevolent\r\ndivinity to be shunned, but because they think that the constitutions of\r\nstates are mainly upheld by Fear. For this reason, Aristotle tells us\r\nthat the Ephors, when they enter upon their office, issue a proclamation\r\nordering the citizens to shave the moustache and obey the laws, that the\r\nlaws might not be hard upon them. The injunction about shaving the\r\nmoustache is inserted, I imagine, in order to accustom the young to\r\nobedience even in the most trivial matters. It seems to me that the\r\nancient Spartans did not regard bravery as consisting in the absence of\r\nfear, but in the fear of shame and dread of dishonour; for those who\r\nfear the laws most are the bravest in battle; and those who most fear\r\ndisgrace care least for their own personal safety. The poet was right\r\nwho said\r\n\r\n   \"Where there is fear, is reverence too;\"\r\n\r\nand Homer makes Helen call Priam\r\n\r\n               \"My father-in-law dear,\r\n   Whom most of all I reverence and fear;\"\r\n\r\nwhile he speaks of the Greek army as obeying\r\n\r\n   \"Its chiefs commands in silence and with fear.\"\r\n\r\nHuman nature, indeed, leads most men to reverence those whom they fear;\r\nand this is why the Lacedæmonians placed the temple of Fear close to the\r\ndining-hall of the Ephors, because they invested that office with almost\r\nroyal authority.\r\n\r\nX. On the following morning Kleomenes published a list containing the\r\nnames of eighty citizens, whom he required to leave the country, and\r\nremoved the chairs of the Ephors, except one, which he intended to\r\noccupy himself. He now convoked an assembly, and made a speech\r\njustifying his recent acts. In the time of Lykurgus, he said, the kings\r\nand the senate shared between them the supreme authority in the State;\r\nand for a long time the government was carried on in this manner without\r\nany alteration being required, until, during the long wars with Messene,\r\nas the kings had no leisure to attend to public affairs, they chose some\r\nof their friends to sit as judges in their stead, and these persons\r\nacted at first merely as the servants of the kings, but gradually got\r\nall power into their own hands, and thus insensibly established a new\r\npower in the State. A proof of the truth of this is to be found in the\r\ncustom which still prevails, that when the Ephors send for the king, he\r\nrefuses to attend at the first and second summons, but rises and goes to\r\nthem at the third. Asteropus, who first consolidated the power of the\r\nEphors, and raised it to the highest point, flourished in comparatively\r\nrecent times, many generations after the original establishment of the\r\noffice. If, he went on to say, the Ephors would have behaved with\r\nmoderation, it would have been better to allow them to remain in\r\nexistence; but when they began to use their ill-gotten power to destroy\r\nthe constitution of Sparta, when they banished one king, put another to\r\ndeath without trial, and kept down by terror all those who wished for\r\nthe introduction of the noblest and most admirable reforms, they could\r\nno longer be borne. Had he been able without shedding a drop of blood to\r\ndrive out of Lacedæmon all those foreign pests of luxury, extravagance,\r\ndebt, money-lending, and those two more ancient evils, poverty and\r\nriches, he should have accounted himself the most fortunate of kings,\r\nbecause, like a skilful physician, he had painlessly performed so\r\nimportant an operation upon his country: as it was, the use of force was\r\nsanctioned by the example of Lykurgus, who, though only a private man,\r\nappeared in arms in the market-place, and so terrified King Charilaus,\r\nthat he fled for refuge to the altar of Athena. He, however, being an\r\nhonest and patriotic man, soon joined Lykurgus, and acquiesced in the\r\nreforms which he introduced, while the acts of Lykurgus prove that it is\r\nhard to effect a revolution without armed force, of which he declared\r\nthat he had made a most sparing use, and had only put out of the way\r\nthose who were opposed to the best interests of Lacedæmon. He announced\r\nto the rest of the citizens that the land should be divided among them,\r\nthat they should be relieved from all their debts, and that all resident\r\naliens should be submitted to an examination, in order that the best of\r\nthem might be selected to become full citizens of Sparta, and help to\r\ndefend the city from falling a prey to Ætolians and Illyrians for want\r\nof men to defend her.\r\n\r\nXI. After this he himself first threw his inheritance into the common\r\nstock, and his example was followed by his father-in-law Megistonous,\r\nhis friends, and the rest of the citizens. The land was now divided, and\r\none lot was assigned to each of those whom he had banished, all of whom\r\nhe said it was his intention to bring back as soon as order was\r\nrestored. He recruited the numbers of the citizens by the admission of\r\nthe most eligible of the Perioeki to the franchise, and organised them\r\ninto a body of four thousand heavy armed infantry, whom he taught to use\r\nthe sarissa, or Macedonian pike which was grasped with both hands,\r\ninstead of the spear, and to sling their shields by a strap instead of\r\nusing a handle. He next turned his attention to the education and\r\ndiscipline of the youth, in which task he was assisted by Sphærus. The\r\ngymnasia and the common meals were soon re-established, and the\r\ncitizens, for the most part willingly, resumed their simple Laconian\r\nhabits of living. Kleomenes, fearing to be called a despot, appointed\r\nhis own brother, Eukleidas, as his colleague. Then for the first time\r\nwere two kings of the same family seen at once in Sparta.\r\n\r\nXII. As Kleomenes perceived that Aratus and the Achæans thought that\r\nwhile Sparta was passing through so perilous a crisis her troops were\r\nnot likely to leave the country, he thought that it would be both a\r\nspirited and a useful act to display the enthusiasm of his army to the\r\nenemy. He invaded the territory of Megalopolis, carried off a large\r\nbooty, and laid waste a large extent of country. Finding a company of\r\nplayers on their road from Messene, he took them prisoners, caused a\r\ntheatre to be erected in the enemy's country, and offered them forty\r\nminæ for a performance for one day, at which he himself attended as a\r\nspectator, not that he cared for the performance, but because he wished\r\nto mock at his enemies, and to show by this studied insult the enormous\r\nsuperiority of which he was conscious. At this period his was the only\r\narmy, Greek or foreign, which was not attended by actors, jugglers,\r\ndancing-girls, and singers; but he kept it free from all licentiousness\r\nand buffoonery, as the younger men were nearly always being practised in\r\nmartial exercises, while the elders acted as their instructors; and when\r\nthey were at leisure they amused themselves with witty retorts and\r\nsententious Laconian pleasantries. The great value of this kind of\r\ndiscipline is described at greater length in the life of Lykurgus.\r\n\r\nXIII. In everything Kleomenes himself acted as their teacher, and\r\nexample, offering his own simple, frugal life, so entirely free from\r\nvulgar superfluities, as a model of sobriety for them all to copy; and\r\nthis added greatly to his influence in Greece. For when men attended\r\nthe courts of the other kings of that period they were not so much\r\nimpressed by their wealth and lavish expenditure as they were disgusted\r\nby their arrogant, overbearing manners; but when they met Kleomenes, who\r\nwas every inch a king, and saw that he wore no purple robes, did not\r\nlounge on couches and litters, and was not surrounded by a crowd of\r\nmessengers, doorkeepers, and secretaries, so as to be difficult of\r\naccess, but that he himself, dressed in plain clothes, came and shook\r\nthem by the hand, and conversed with them in a kindly and encouraging\r\ntone, they were completely fascinated and charmed by him, and declared\r\nthat he alone was a true descendant of Herakles. His dinner was usually\r\nserved upon a very small Laconian table with three couches,[12] but if\r\nhe were entertaining ambassadors or foreigners two additional couches\r\nwere added, and his servants somewhat improved his dinner, not by adding\r\nto it made-dishes and pastry, but by serving a greater abundance of food\r\nand a more liberal allowance of wine. Indeed he blamed one of his\r\nfriends, when he heard that when entertaining foreigners at dinner he\r\nhad placed before them black broth and barley cakes: for he said that in\r\nsuch matters, and when entertaining strangers, it was not well to be too\r\nrigidly Spartan. After the table was removed a tripod was brought in\r\nwhich supported a bronze bowl full of wine, two silver pateræ, that held\r\neach about a pint, and a number of very small silver cups, from which\r\nany one drank who wished, for Kleomenes never forced men to drink\r\nagainst their will. No recitations were performed for the amusement of\r\nthe guests; for he himself would lead the conversation and entertain\r\nthem over their wine, partly by asking questions of them and partly by\r\nrelating anecdotes to them: for he well knew both how to make serious\r\nsubjects interesting, and to be pleasant and witty without giving\r\noffence. He was of opinion that the habit of other princes, of tempting\r\nmen into their service by presents and bribes, was both clumsy and\r\nwicked; but he thought it peculiarly befitting a king to influence and\r\ncaptivate men's minds by the charm of his conversation, and was wont to\r\nsay that a friend differed only from a mercenary soldier in that a man\r\nwins the one by the influence of his character and his conversation, and\r\nthe other by his money.\r\n\r\nXIV. First of all the people of Mantinea made overtures to him. They\r\nadmitted him to their city by night, aided him to drive out the Achæan\r\ngarrison, and placed themselves unreservedly in his hands. He, however,\r\nrestored them to the enjoyment of their own laws and original\r\nconstitution, and marched away the same day to Tegea. Shortly afterwards\r\nby a circuitous march through Arcadia he arrived before the Achæan city\r\nof Pheræ, desiring either to fight a battle with the Achæans, or to make\r\nAratus incur the disgrace of retreating and leaving him in possession of\r\nthe country: for although Hyperbates was nominally in command, all real\r\npower over the Achæans was in the hands of Aratus. The Achæans took the\r\nfield with their entire force, and encamped at Dymæ, near the temple\r\ncalled Hekatombæon. When Kleomenes arrived here he was unwilling to\r\nestablish himself between the hostile city of Dymæ and the army of the\r\nAchæans, and challenged them, forced them to fight, and completely\r\nrouted their phalanx. He killed many, took a large number of prisoners,\r\nand then, marching to Langon, drove out the Achæan garrison, and\r\nrestored the city to the Eleans.\r\n\r\nXV. As the Achæan power was now quite broken, Aratus, who was usually\r\nelected general every other year, refused to take office, and excused\r\nhimself when they besought him to do so: a dishonourable act, when the\r\ntimes became more stormy, to desert the helm, and give up his power to\r\nanother. Kleomenes at first used very moderate language to the Achæan\r\nambassadors, but sent others ordering them to acknowledge him for their\r\nsovereign, and promising that if they did so he would do them no further\r\nhurt, and would at once restore the prisoners and fortresses which he\r\nhad taken. As the Achæans were willing to accept these terms they\r\ninvited Kleomenes to a conference at Lerna. It happened, however, that\r\nKleomenes, after a long march, drank a quantity of cold water, which\r\ncaused him to bring up much blood, and to lose his voice. In\r\nconsequence of this, although he sent back the most distinguished of his\r\nprisoners, he was obliged to postpone the conference, and went home to\r\nLacedæmon.\r\n\r\nXVI. This mischance ruined Greece, which even now might have recovered\r\nherself, and avoided falling into the hands of the insolent and\r\nrapacious Macedonians. For Aratus, either because he distrusted and\r\nfeared Kleomenes, or else because he grudged him his success, and\r\nthought that after he had for thirty-three years been chief of the\r\nAchæans, it was not to be endured that a young man should overthrow him,\r\nand enter into the fruit of his labours, at first tried to oppose the\r\nAchæans when they offered to come to terms with the Lacedæmonians; but\r\nas they would not listen to him, because they were cowed by the boldness\r\nof Kleomenes, and also admitted the justice of the Lacedæmonian claim to\r\nbe the leading state in Peloponnesus, as their ancestral right, he\r\nadopted a course which was a disgraceful one for any Greek, but\r\nespecially so for him, and one which was most unworthy of his former\r\npolitical life. He determined to invite Antigonus into Greece, and to\r\nfill the Pelopennesus with those very Macedonians whom he himself when a\r\nlad had chased out of the country by his capture of the Acro-Corinthus,\r\nalthough he was regarded with suspicion by all the kings, and was at\r\nvariance with them all, and though he had already accused this very\r\nAntigonus himself of every conceivable crime in his \"Memoirs,\" which are\r\nstill extant. Yet he himself has stated that he suffered much, and\r\nrisked much to free Athens from a Macedonian garrison; though now he led\r\nthese very men with arms in their hands into his own native country, and\r\nup to his own paternal hearth. He thought that Kleomenes, a descendant\r\nof Herakles, a king of Sparta, who had restored the simple ancient\r\nDorian constitution of Lykurgus, as one tightens the relaxed strings of\r\na lyre, to bring it into tune, was unworthy to be accounted the ruler of\r\nSikyon and Tritæa; and in his eagerness to avoid the rough Spartan\r\ncloak, and the Spartan barley bread, and that with which he especially\r\ncharged Kleomenes, the destruction of wealth and the encouragement of\r\npoverty, threw himself and all Achæa with him, into the arms of the\r\nMacedonians, with all their diadems and their purple robes and their\r\nhabits of oriental despotism. That he might avoid acting under the\r\norders of Kleomenes, he was content to offer sacrifice at festivals in\r\nhonour of Antigonus, and himself to place a garland upon his head, and\r\nto lead the pæan in praise of a man wasted and emaciated by consumption.\r\nAnd this I write, not from any desire to depreciate Aratus, for in many\r\nrespects he proved himself a truly great and patriotic man, but rather\r\nout of pity for the weakness of human nature, which will not allow even\r\nthe most eminent persons to present us with the spectacle of an entirely\r\nunblemished virtue.\r\n\r\nXVII. When the Achæans again assembled at Argos to hold a conference\r\nthere, and Kleomenes started to go thither from Tegea, men's minds were\r\nfull of hope that peace would be finally established. But Aratus, who\r\nhad already settled the main points of his treaty with Antigonus, and\r\nfeared that Kleomenes would either by persuasion or force bring the\r\nassembly over to his views, sent to him demanding either that he should\r\ntake three hundred hostages for his safety and come to the conference\r\nalone, or else meet them with his army outside the walls at the\r\ngymnasium called the Kyllarabium. Kleomenes on hearing this said that he\r\nhad not been properly treated; for Aratus ought to have warned him of\r\nthis at once, not have waited till he was almost at the gates of Argos\r\nand then expressed suspicions of his honesty of purpose and driven him\r\naway. He sent a letter to the assembled Achæans, containing bitter\r\ninvectives against Aratus, and as Aratus replied by maligning him in a\r\npublic oration, he broke up his camp and sent a herald with a\r\ndeclaration of war, not to Argos, according to Aratus, but to Ægium, in\r\norder to take the Achæans by surprise. The Achæan cities were all ripe\r\nfor revolt, as the populace hoped for a redistribution of the land and\r\ncancelling of debts if they joined the Spartans, while the leading men\r\nwere all jealous of the power and influence of Aratus, and some of them\r\nhated him as the traitor who was bringing the Macedonians into\r\nPeloponnesus. Relying upon the prevalence of this feeling Kleomenes\r\ninvaded Achaia, took Pellene by surprise, and drove out the garrison\r\nand the Achæan inhabitants. Soon afterwards he captured the cities of\r\nPheneus and Penteleum.\r\n\r\nThe Achæans of Corinth and Sikyon now began to fear that his partisans\r\nwere plotting to deliver up those cities to him, and in consequence sent\r\ntheir cavalry and foreign mercenaries away from Argos to guard those\r\ntowns, while they themselves proceeded to Argos to hold the Nemean\r\nfestival there. Kleomenes, rightly judging that his appearance at a time\r\nwhen the city was full of a disorderly crowd of people who were come to\r\nattend the feasts and games would produce great confusion, marched up to\r\nthe walls by night, seized the place called the 'Shield,' which is just\r\nabove the theatre, and is very difficult of access, and so terrified the\r\ncitizens that no one attempted to offer any resistance. They willingly\r\nagreed to admit a Spartan garrison, to give twenty of their chief men as\r\nhostages for their loyalty, and to become the allies of the\r\nLacedæmonians, acknowledging their supremacy.\r\n\r\nXVIII. This exploit added not a little to the reputation and power of\r\nKleomenes. None of the ancient kings of Sparta could ever make\r\nthemselves masters of Argos, although they often attempted to do so; and\r\neven that most brilliant general King Pyrrhus, though he forced his way\r\ninto the city, could not take it, but perished, and with him a great\r\npart of his army. For these reasons, the skill and audacity of Kleomenes\r\nwere the more admired: and those who had before ridiculed his attempts\r\nto bring back the days of Solon and Lykurgus by the cancelling of debts\r\nand redistribution of land, now became entirely convinced that these\r\nmeasures had been the cause of the revival of Sparta. The Spartans\r\nbefore this had been so feeble and helpless, that the Ætolians invaded\r\nLaconia and carried off a booty of fifty thousand slaves, on which\r\noccasion it is said that an old Spartan observed that the enemy had\r\ngreatly benefited Laconia by relieving it from its burdens. Yet a short\r\ntime after this, by the restoration of their former constitution, and by\r\nre-establishing the ancient system of training, they made as magnificent\r\na display of discipline and valour as if Lykurgus himself were alive and\r\nat the head of affairs, for they gained for Sparta the first place in\r\nGreece, and won the whole of Peloponnesus by the sword.\r\n\r\nXIX. The submission of Argos to Kleomenes was soon followed by that of\r\nPhlius and Kleonæ. During these events Aratus was at Corinth, busily\r\nengaged in searching for the partisans of the Lacedæmonians. When the\r\nnews of the fall of these cities reached Corinth, as he observed that\r\nthe city of Corinth was eager to join Kleomenes and leave the Achæan\r\nleague, he summoned the citizens to meet in the public assembly, and\r\nhimself made his way unperceived to the gate. He had already sent his\r\nhorse thither, and mounting, fled to Sikyon. The Corinthians now hurried\r\nto Argos to surrender their city to Kleomenes; in such haste, writes\r\nAratus in his 'Memoirs,' that they foundered all their horses. Kleomenes\r\nreproached them for allowing Aratus to escape, but shortly afterwards\r\nsent Megistonous to him, asking him to hand over the citadel of Corinth,\r\nwhich was in possession of an Achæan garrison, and offering him a large\r\nsum of money. He answered that the course of affairs was not in his\r\npower, but that he was rather in theirs. These particulars we have\r\nextracted from Aratus's own writings. Kleomenes now marched from Argos\r\nto Corinth, receiving on the way the submission of Troezene, Epidaurus,\r\nand Hermione. As the garrison refused to surrender the citadel, he built\r\na rampart round it, and sending for the friends and representatives of\r\nAratus, bade them take charge of his house and property during his\r\nabsence. He now sent the Messenian Tritymallus to Aratus, with\r\ninstructions to propose to him that the garrison of Acro-Corinthus\r\nshould be composed partly of Spartan and partly of Achæan troops, while\r\nhe himself privately offered him double the amount of the pension which\r\nhe received from King Ptolemy of Egypt. However, as Aratus refused to\r\nlisten to his overtures, but sent his own son with the other hostages to\r\nAntigonus, and persuaded the Achæans to pass a decree to hand over the\r\nAcro-Corinthus to Antigonus, Kleomenes invaded the territory of Sikyon\r\nand laid it waste, and also took the property of Aratus when it was\r\npublicly presented to him by the people of Corinth.\r\n\r\nXX. When Antigonus crossed the Geranean mountains with a large force,\r\nKleomenes did not think it necessary to guard the isthmus, but\r\ndetermined to fortify the mountains called Onea, and by holding that\r\nstrong position, to protract the war and wear out the Macedonian force,\r\nrather than fight a pitched battle with their phalanx. By this line of\r\npolicy he reduced Antigonus to great straits; for he had made no\r\npreparations for feeding his troops for more than a short time, and yet\r\nto force his way in over the isthmus was a difficult operation while\r\nKleomenes barred the way. An attempt which he made to steal through by\r\nLechæum[13] at night was repulsed with considerable loss; so that\r\nKleomenes and his friends, elated by their victory, supped merrily\r\ntogether, while Antigonus was at his wit's end to know what to do. He\r\neven began to meditate marching to the promontory of Heræum, and\r\nconveying his forces over the Corinthian gulf to Sikyon, an operation\r\nwhich would have required much time and many ships. However, late in the\r\nevening there arrived certain friends of Aratus by sea from Argos,\r\ninviting him to come thither, as the Argives intended to revolt from\r\nKleomenes. The prime mover in this revolt was one Aristoteles, who\r\neasily prevailed upon the people to rise, because they were disappointed\r\nwith Kleomenes, who had not cancelled all their debts as they hoped he\r\nwould. Aratus now took fifteen hundred of Antigonus's soldiers and\r\nproceeded by sea to Epidaurus. Aristoteles however did not wait for his\r\narrival, but led the citizens to attack the garrison in the citadel,\r\nassisted by Timoxenus with a body of Achæans from Sikyon.\r\n\r\nXXI. Intelligence of this movement reached Kleomenes about the second\r\nwatch of the night. He at once sent for Megistonous, and angrily ordered\r\nhim at once to go to the assistance of the garrison of Argos; for it was\r\nhe who had so confidently assured Kleomenes of the loyalty of the\r\nArgives, and had dissuaded him from banishing those whom he suspected\r\nfrom the city. Having detached Megistonous with two thousand men on this\r\nservice, he himself turned his attention to Antigonus, and pacified the\r\npeople of Corinth by assuring them that nothing had happened at Argos\r\nexcept a slight disturbance which would be easily suppressed. However,\r\nas Megistonous was killed while forcing his way into the city, and the\r\ngarrison were hard pressed, and kept sending messengers to Kleomenes\r\nbegging for assistance, he, fearing that if the enemy gained Argos they\r\nmight cut him off from Laconia, and sack the defenceless city of Sparta,\r\nwithdrew his army from Corinth. He lost this city at once, for Antigonus\r\ninstantly entered it and placed a garrison in it. He now proceeded to\r\nassault the city wall of Argos, and concentrated his troops for this\r\npurpose. He broke through the vaults supporting the part of the city\r\ncalled the 'Shield,' forced his way in, and joined his garrison, who\r\nwere still holding out against the Achæans. He now, by the use of\r\nscaling ladders, captured some of the strong places in the city, and\r\ncleared the streets of the enemy by means of his Cretan archers. When\r\nhowever he saw Antigonus marching down from the mountains to the plain\r\nwith his phalanx in battle array, and saw the Macedonian cavalry pouring\r\nalong towards the city, he despaired of success, and collecting all his\r\ntroops into one mass, led them safely out of the city. He had in a\r\nwonderfully short time effected great things, and had all but made\r\nhimself master of the whole of Peloponnesus: but now he lost it all as\r\nquickly as he had won it, for some of his allies at once deserted him,\r\nand many shortly afterwards surrendered their cities to Antigonus.\r\n\r\nXXII. As Kleomenes was marching into the city of Tegea at nightfall, on\r\nhis return from this disastrous campaign, he was met by messengers\r\nbearing the news of a still greater calamity, the death of his wife\r\nAgiatis, of whom he was so fond that even when in the full tide of\r\nsuccess he never would remain continuously with his army, but used\r\nconstantly to return to Sparta to see her. He was terribly grieved and\r\ncast down, as one would expect a young man to be on losing so beautiful\r\nand excellent a wife, yet he did not allow his noble spirit to be\r\ncrushed by his sorrow, but without showing any outward signs of grief in\r\nhis voice or countenance, continued to give his orders to his officers,\r\nand to take measures for placing Tegea in a posture of defence. At\r\ndaybreak next morning he returned to Lacedæmon, and after lamenting his\r\nmisfortune with his mother and his children, began to consider by what\r\npolicy he might save his country.\r\n\r\nPtolemy, the king of Egypt, now offered him assistance on the condition\r\nof receiving his mother and children as hostages. For a long time he\r\nshrank from mentioning this proposal to his mother, and often conversed\r\nwith her without having the courage to allude to it, until she suspected\r\nthat he had something on his mind, and inquired of his friends whether\r\nthere was not some subject about which he hesitated to speak to her. At\r\nlast Kleomenes brought himself to mention Ptolemy's proposal to her. On\r\nhearing it, she laughed loudly, and said, \"This, then, is that which you\r\nhave so long been fearing to tell me. Pray place me and the children on\r\nboard ship as soon as possible, and send us to any place where this body\r\nof mine may be useful to Sparta, before it be uselessly consumed by old\r\nage at home.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all was prepared for her voyage, Kratesiklea proceeded to Tænarus\r\nescorted by Kleomenes with all his troops under arms. Before embarking\r\nshe retired alone with him into the temple of Poseidon, where, after\r\nembracing him as he sorrowed at her departure, she said, \"Now, king of\r\nthe Lacedæmonians, take care when we come out that no one sees us\r\nweeping or doing anything unworthy of Sparta. This lies in our own\r\npower; but good or evil fortune befalls us according to the will of\r\nHeaven.\"\r\n\r\nSaying thus, she fixed her eyes upon the ship, walked swiftly to it\r\ncarrying the child, and bade the pilot start at once. When she reached\r\nEgypt, as she heard that Ptolemy had received an embassy from Antigonus,\r\nand was told that although the Achæans wished to come to terms with him,\r\nhe had feared on her account to make peace with them without consulting\r\nPtolemy, she wrote to him bidding him act worthily of Sparta, and\r\nconsult her interests, and not fear to displease Ptolemy because of what\r\nhe might do to an old woman and an infant. So great a spirit is she said\r\nto have shown in her misfortunes.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Antigonus now advanced, took Tegea, and allowed his troops to\r\nplunder Orchomenus and Mantinea. Kleomenes, who was confined to the\r\nterritory of Lacedæmon, proceeded to emancipate all helots who could\r\npay a sum of five Attic minæ for their freedom, by which means he raised\r\na sum of five hundred talents. He also organised a special corps of two\r\nthousand men, armed after the Macedonian fashion, with which he hoped to\r\nbe able to meet the Leukaspids,[14] or white-shielded troops of\r\nAntigonus, and proceeded to attempt a wonderful and surprising feat of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThe city of Megalopolis at that time was itself quite as large and as\r\npowerful as Sparta, and had close at hand the army of the Achæans, and\r\nthat of Antigonus himself, whom the people of Megalopolis had been\r\nespecially eager to invite into Peloponnesus. This city Kleomenes\r\ndetermined to pounce upon: (no other word expresses the speed with which\r\nhe surprised it). He ordered his troops to provision themselves for five\r\ndays, and led them to Sellasia, as though he intended to invade Argolis.\r\nFrom Sellasia he marched into the territory of Megalopolis, halted at\r\nRhoeteum for supper, and thence proceeded along the road by Helikus\r\nstraight towards Megalopolis. When he was close to it he detached\r\nPanteus with two regiments to attack a part of the wall lying between\r\ntwo towers, which he had heard was often left unguarded, while he moved\r\nslowly forward with the main body. Panteus not only found that spot, but\r\na great extent of the city wall unguarded. While he was engaged in\r\nthrowing down the wall and killing those who attempted to defend it,\r\nKleomenes came up, and was within the city with his army before the\r\npeople of Megalopolis knew of his arrival.\r\n\r\nXXIV. When at last the inhabitants discovered the extent of their\r\nmisfortune, some snatched up what they could and fled at once, while\r\nothers got under arms and endeavoured to drive out the enemy. In this\r\nthey could not succeed, but they enabled the fugitives to escape\r\nunmolested, so that no more than a thousand souls remained in the city,\r\nas all the rest got safe with their wives and children to Messene. Of\r\nthose who offered resistance but a few were slain, and a very small\r\nnumber were taken prisoners, amongst whom were Lysandridas and\r\nThearidas, the two most important persons in Megalopolis. On this\r\naccount the soldiers who took them brought them at once to Kleomenes.\r\nLysandridas, as soon as he saw Kleomenes at a distance, called out\r\nloudly to him, \"King of the Lacedæmonians, now you have an opportunity\r\nto add to your glory by a deed even more noble and more worthy of a king\r\nthan that which you have achieved!\" Kleomenes, suspecting what he meant,\r\nasked, \"What do you mean, Lysandridas? do you bid me give you back your\r\ncity?\" \"That is what I bid you to do,\" answered Lysandridas; \"and I\r\nadvise you not to ruin so great a city, but to fill it with friends and\r\ntrusty allies, by restoring it to the people of Megalopolis, and\r\nbecoming their saviour.\" To this Kleomenes, after a short silence,\r\nreplied, \"It is hard to believe this; but let us ever prefer honour to\r\nprofit.\" Saying this he sent his prisoners to Messene, and a herald with\r\nthem, who offered to restore the city to the people of Megalopolis, on\r\nthe condition that they should desert the Achæans and become the friends\r\nand allies of the Spartans. However, Philopoemen would not allow his\r\ncountrymen to break their faith with the Achæans and accept this wise\r\nand generous offer. He declared that Kleomenes did not intend to give\r\nthem back their city, but wanted to get possession of them as well as of\r\ntheir city, and with violent abuse drove Thearidas and Lysandridas out\r\nof the Messenian country. This was that Philopoemen who afterwards became\r\nthe general of the Achæans and won great distinction, as will be found\r\nin the life of him which I have written.\r\n\r\nXXV. When this answer was brought back to Kleomenes, who had hitherto\r\ncarefully kept the city unharmed, and had not allowed any one to\r\nappropriate the most trifling article, he became furious with\r\ndisappointment. He plundered the city, sent all the statues and pictures\r\nto Sparta, utterly destroyed all the best part of the city, and\r\nreturned home, for he feared Antigonus and the Achæans. They, however,\r\ndid not offer to attack him: for they were engaged in holding a\r\nconference at Ægium. Here Aratus ascended the tribune, and for a long\r\ntime wept with his face hidden in his gown. At last, as the others in\r\nwonder bade him tell them the cause of his grief, he said that\r\nMegalopolis had been ruined by Kleomenes. On hearing this the assembly\r\nat once broke up. The Achæans were terror-stricken at the suddenness and\r\nimportance of the blow, and Antigonus determined to proceed to the\r\nassistance of the people of Megalopolis, but as it took a long time to\r\nassemble his troops from their winter-quarters, he ordered them to stay\r\nwhere they were, and himself with a small force marched to Argos.\r\nKleomenes now engaged in a second enterprise, which appeared completely\r\ninsane, but which is said by the historian Polybius to show consummate\r\ngeneralship. As he knew that all the Macedonian troops were scattered\r\nover the country in winter-quarters, and that Antigonus with a few\r\nmercenary troops was spending the winter at Argos with his friends, he\r\ninvaded the Argive territory, thinking that either he should shame\r\nAntigonus into a battle, and beat him, or else that if he did not dare\r\nto fight, the Argives would be disgusted with him. And so it fell out.\r\nThe Argives, seeing their country spoiled by Kleomenes, were greatly\r\nenraged, and gathering together before the house in which Antigonus was\r\nlodging, excitedly called upon him either to fight or to resign his post\r\nas commander-in-chief in favour of a better man. But Antigonus, like a\r\nprudent general as he was, thought it more disgraceful to run foolish\r\nrisks and incur unnecessary danger than to hear himself called hard\r\nnames by the mob, and refused to leave the city, but stood constant in\r\nhis original policy. Kleomenes, after marching up to the gates of Argos,\r\nostentatiously ravaged the country, and returned home unmolested.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Shortly afterwards, hearing that Antigonus had again advanced to\r\nTegea, intending to invade Laconia by that route, Kleomenes quickly\r\nassembled his army, marched by a different road, avoiding Antigonus, and\r\nat daybreak appeared near the city of Argos, where he ravaged the\r\nplain country, not reaping the corn, as invaders usually do, with\r\nsickles and swords, but beating down with great clubs, so that his\r\nsoldiers in sheer sport as they marched along were able to destroy the\r\nwhole crop without trouble. When they reached the gymnasium of\r\nKyllarabis some of the officers proposed to set it on fire; but\r\nKleomenes forbade it, saying that even in destroying Megalopolis he had\r\nbeen guided by anger rather than by honour. Antigonus at first retired\r\ndirectly towards Argos, but afterwards occupied all the passes by which\r\nthe Lacedæmonians could retreat. Kleomenes affected to set him at\r\ndefiance, and sent a herald to Argos to demand the keys of the temple of\r\nHera (between Argos and Mycenæ), in order that he might offer sacrifice\r\nthere before retiring. After insulting the Argives by this ironical\r\nrequest, he offered sacrifice outside the temple, for the doors remained\r\nlocked, and led away his army to Phlius. From thence he marched to Mount\r\nOligyrtus, where he defeated the Macedonian troops who guarded the pass,\r\nand returned home by way of Orchomenus, having inspired his countrymen\r\nwith hope and confidence, and having proved to his enemies that he was a\r\nconsummate general, capable of conducting the most important operations.\r\nIt was indeed no small feat for him, with only the resources of one\r\nsmall state at his disposal, to make war against the power of Macedonia\r\nand all the cities of the Peloponnesus, with Antigonus for their\r\npaymaster, and not only to prevent the enemy's setting foot in Laconia,\r\nbut to lay waste their country, and take such large and important cities\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nXXVII. However, he who first called money the sinews of war must have\r\nhad this war in his mind. So also Demades, when the Athenians wished to\r\nman a fleet at a time when they had no money, observed that they must\r\nmake bread before they could make a voyage. Archidamus, too, who was\r\nking of Sparta at the opening of the Peloponnesian war, when his allies\r\nasked him to fix the limit of their several contributions, answered that\r\nthe consumption of war is unlimited. For just as trained athletes in\r\ntime overpower their antagonist in spite of his strength and skill, so\r\nAntigonus, having vast resources to draw upon, wearied out and\r\noverpowered Kleomenes, who had the greatest difficulty in paying his\r\nmercenary troops and feeding his countrymen. In other respects the long\r\nduration of the contest was in Kleomenes's favour, as Antigonus had\r\ntroubles at home which made the contest a more equal one. The\r\nbarbarians, in his absence, always overran and plundered the outskirts\r\nof the kingdom of Macedonia, and at this period an army of Illyrians had\r\ninvaded the country from the north, against whose depredations the\r\nMacedonians besought Antigonus to return and protect them. The letter\r\ncalling upon him to return was very nearly delivered to him before the\r\ndecisive battle of the war; and had he received it, he would no doubt\r\nhave returned home at once and taken a long farewell of the Achæans.\r\nHowever, fortune, who delights to show that the most important events\r\nare decided by the merest trifles, caused the embassy with the letters\r\nfor the recall of Antigonus to reach him just after the battle of\r\nSellasia, in which Kleomenes lost his army and his country. This makes\r\nthe misfortune of Kleomenes yet more pitiable; for if he had avoided a\r\nbattle for two days longer, he never need have fought at all, as the\r\nMacedonians would have retreated, and left him to make what terms he\r\npleased with the Achæans: whereas, as has been explained, his want of\r\nmoney forced him to fight, and that too when, according to Polybius, he\r\nhad only twenty thousand men to oppose to thirty thousand.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. In the battle he acted like a great general, and the Spartans\r\nfought with desperate courage, while the mercenary troops also behaved\r\nwell; but he was overpowered by the Macedonian armament and by the\r\nirresistible weight of their phalanx. The historian Phylarchus says that\r\nKleomenes was ruined by treachery, for Antigonus sent his Illyrians and\r\nAkarnanians to make a flank march and attack one of the enemy's wings,\r\nwhich was commanded by Eukleidas, the brother of Kleomenes, and there\r\nplaced the rest of his army in battle array. Kleomenes, who was watching\r\nthe enemy from an eminence, could not see the Illyrian and Akarnanian\r\ntroops, and suspected some manoeuvre of the kind. He sent for Damoteles,\r\nthe chief of the Spartan secret-service,[15] and ordered him to explore\r\nthe ground on both flanks, and see that no attack was meditated in that\r\ndirection. As Damoteles, who is said to have been bribed by Antigonus,\r\nanswered that all was well on the flanks, and that he had better give\r\nhis entire attention to the enemy in front, Kleomenes believed him, and\r\nat once charged the army of Antigonus. The furious attack of the\r\nSpartans drove back the Macedonian phalanx, and Kleomenes forced it to\r\nretreat before him for a distance of about five stadia. Then, as he\r\nfound that his brother Eukleidas on the other wing was surrounded by the\r\nenemy, he halted, and looking towards him, said, \"You are gone, my\r\ndearest brother; you have fought bravely, and are a noble model to the\r\nSpartan youth, a noble theme for Spartan maidens' songs.\" Then, as the\r\nentire division under Eukleidas was cut to pieces, and the victors\r\nattacked his own men, who were thrown into confusion and could no longer\r\nstand their ground, he escaped from the field as best he could. It is\r\nsaid that many of the mercenaries were slain, and that of the\r\nLacedæmonians, who were six thousand in all, only two hundred remained\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Kleomenes, when he reached Sparta, advised the citizens whom he\r\nmet to submit to Antigonus, and declared that he himself, whether he\r\nlived or died, would do what was best for Sparta. As he saw the women\r\nrunning up to those who had accompanied him in his flight, taking their\r\narms from them and offering them drink, he retired into his own house,\r\nwhere his mistress, a girl of a good family of Megalopolis, whom he had\r\ntaken to live with him after his wife's death, came up to him as usual,\r\nand wished to attend upon him on his return from the wars. But he would\r\nneither drink, although excessively thirsty, nor sit down, weary though\r\nhe was, but in his armour as he was took hold of one of the columns with\r\nhis hand, leaned his face upon his elbow, and after resting a short\r\ntime in this posture while he revolved in his mind every kind of plan,\r\nproceeded with his friends to Grythium. Here they embarked on a ship\r\nwhich had been prepared in case of such a disaster, and sailed away.\r\n\r\nXXX. After the battle Antigonus advanced upon Sparta, and made himself\r\nmaster of the city. He treated the Lacedæmonians with kindness, and\r\noffered no kind of insult to their glorious city, but permitted them to\r\nretain their laws and constitution, sacrificed to the gods, and on the\r\nthird day withdrew, as he had learned that a terrible war was raging in\r\nMacedonia, and that his kingdom was being ravaged by the barbarians. His\r\nhealth was already affected by a disease, which ended in consumption.\r\nHowever, he bore up against it, and was able to die gloriously after\r\nhaving recovered his kingdom, won a great victory over the barbarians,\r\nand killed a great number of them. Phylarchus tells us that he ruptured\r\nhis lungs by shouting in the battle itself, and this seems the most\r\nprobable account, but the common report at the time was that while\r\nshouting aloud after the victory, \"O happy day!\" he brought up a vast\r\nquantity of blood and fell sick of a fever, of which he died. Such was\r\nthe fate of Antigonus.\r\n\r\nXXXI. Kleomenes sailed from Kythera to another island, named Ægialea. As\r\nhe was about to cross over from this place to Cyrene, one of his friends\r\nnamed Therykion, a brilliant warrior and a man of lofty, unbending\r\nspirit, said to him in private, \"My king, we have lost the opportunity\r\nof falling by the noblest of deaths in the battle, although we publicly\r\ndeclared that Antigonus should never enter Sparta unless he first passed\r\nover the dead body of the king. However, the course which is next to\r\nthis in honour is still open to us. Why should we recklessly embark on\r\nthis voyage merely in order to exchange our misfortunes at home for\r\nothers in a distant country? If it be not disgraceful for the sons of\r\nHerakles to submit to the successors of Philip and Alexander, we shall\r\nsave ourselves a long voyage by delivering ourselves up to Antigonus,\r\nwho is probably as much better than Ptolemy as the Macedonians are\r\nbetter than the Egyptians. If, on the other hand, we scorn to become the\r\nsubjects of our conqueror, why should we become subject to one who has\r\nnot conquered us, and so prove ourselves inferior to two men instead of\r\none, by becoming the courtiers of Ptolemy as well as fleeing before\r\nAntigonus? Is it on account of your mother that we are going to Egypt?\r\nIf so, you will indeed make a glorious appearance before her, and you\r\nwill be much to be envied when she shows her son to the ladies of\r\nPtolemy's court, an exile instead of a king. While we are still masters\r\nof our own swords, and are still in sight of Laconia, let us put\r\nourselves beyond the reach of further misfortunes, and make amends to\r\nthose who died for Sparta at Sellasia, rather than settle ourselves in\r\nEgypt, and inquire whom Antigonus has been pleased to appoint satrap of\r\nLacedæmon?\"[16]\r\n\r\nTo these remarks of Therykion Kleomenes answered, \"Wretch, do you think\r\nthat by suicide, the easiest way out of all difficulties, and one which\r\nis within every man's reach, you will gain a reputation for bravery, and\r\nwill not rather be flying before the enemy more disgracefully than at\r\nSellasia? More powerful men than ourselves have ere now been defeated,\r\neither by their own evil fortune or by the excessive numbers of their\r\nenemy: but the man who refuses to bear fatigue and misery, and the scorn\r\nof men, is conquered by his own cowardice. A self-inflicted death ought\r\nto be an honourable action, not a dishonourable means of escape from the\r\nnecessity for action. It is disgraceful either to live or to die for\r\noneself alone: yet this is the course which you recommend, namely, that\r\nI should fly from my present misery without ever again performing any\r\nuseful or honourable action. I think that it is both your duty and mine,\r\nnot to despair of our country: for when all hope fails us, we can easily\r\nfind means to die.\" To this Therykion made no answer, but as soon as he\r\nhad an opportunity left Kleomenes, sought a retired spot upon the beach,\r\nand killed himself.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Kleomenes sailed from Ægialea to Libya, where he was received\r\nwith royal honours and conducted to Alexandria. At his first interview\r\nPtolemy[17] treated him with mere ordinary politeness, but when by\r\nconversation with him he discovered his great abilities, and in the\r\nfamiliar intercourse of daily life observed the noble Spartan simplicity\r\nof his habits, and saw with how proud and unbroken a spirit he bore his\r\nmisfortunes, he thought him a much more trustworthy friend than any of\r\nthe venal throng of courtiers by whom he was surrounded. Ptolemy felt\r\nreal regret at having neglected so great a man, and allowed Antigonus to\r\ngain so much glory and power at his expense. He showed Kleomenes great\r\nkindness and honour, and encouraged him by promising that he would place\r\na fleet and a sum of money at his disposal, which would enable him to\r\nreturn to Greece and recover his throne. He settled upon him a yearly\r\nallowance of twenty-four talents, the most part of which he and his\r\nfriends, who still retained their simple Spartan habits, distributed in\r\ncharity among the Greek refugees who had found an asylum in Egypt.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. The elder Ptolemy died before he could accomplish his promise of\r\nattempting to restore Kleomenes to his throne; and amidst the drunken\r\nlicence of the court of his successor, the affairs of Kleomenes were\r\nentirely neglected. The young king[18] was so given up to wine and\r\nwomen, that his soberest moments were spent in organising religious\r\nceremonies in the palace, and in carrying a kettledrum in honour of the\r\nmother of the gods. The whole of the public business of the kingdom was\r\nmanaged by Agathoklea, the king's mistress, her mother, and the\r\nbrothel-keeper Oenanthes. Yet even here it seems that the assistance of\r\nKleomenes was needed, for the king, fearing his brother Magas, who\r\nthrough his mother had great influence with the army, attached himself\r\nin a special manner to Kleomenes, and made him a member of his own\r\nsecret council, desiring to make use of him to kill his brother.\r\nKleomenes, although every one in the court bade him do this, refused,\r\nsaying that it would rather be his duty, if it were possible, to raise\r\nup more brothers for the king, to strengthen and confirm his throne.\r\nWhen Sosibius, the most powerful of the king's favourites, said that the\r\nmercenary troops were not to be depended upon while Magas was alive,\r\nKleomenes answered that he might be quite easy on that score, for more\r\nthan three thousand of the mercenaries were Peloponnesians, and at the\r\nslightest sign from him would seize their arms and rally round him. This\r\nspeech was thought at the time to be a great proof of the loyalty of\r\nKleomenes, and gave the courtiers a great idea of his power; but\r\nafterwards, as Ptolemy's weakness of character produced cowardice, and\r\nafter the manner of empty-headed men he began to think it safest to\r\nsuspect every one, these words made the courtiers fear Kleomenes, as\r\nhaving a dangerous power over the mercenaries; and many of them were\r\nwont to say, \"This man moves among us like a lion among a flock of\r\nsheep.\" Indeed the demeanour of Kleomenes in the Egyptian palace, as he\r\ncalmly and quietly watched the course of events, naturally suggested\r\nthis simile.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. Kleomenes gave up asking for a fleet and an army; but hearing\r\nthat Antigonus was dead, and that the Achæans were involved in a war\r\nwith the Ætolians, while his presence was imperatively demanded at home,\r\nas all Peloponnesus seemed to be going to ruin, he desired to be sent\r\nhome alone with his friends. However, he could persuade no one to accede\r\nto this request, as the king thought of nothing but his concubines and\r\nhis revels, and Sosibius, upon whom devolved the whole conduct of\r\naffairs, although he knew that Kleomenes would be dangerous and hard to\r\nmanage if kept in Egypt against his will, yet feared to set at large so\r\ndaring and enterprising a man, who had gained a thorough insight into\r\nthe utter rottenness of the Ptolemaic dynasty. For Kleomenes could not\r\nbe bribed into remaining quiet, but as the bull[19] sacred to Apis,\r\nalthough he is abundantly fed and supplied with every luxury, yet longs\r\nto frisk and range about as nature intended, so he cared for none of\r\ntheir effeminate pleasures,\r\n\r\n   \"but wore his soul away\"\r\n\r\nlike Achilles,\r\n\r\n   \"Idling at home, though eager for the fray.\"\r\n\r\nXXXV. While his affairs were in this posture, there arrived at\r\nAlexandria one Nikagoras, a Messenian, who pretended to be a friend to\r\nKleomenes, but really hated him bitterly, because he had once sold him a\r\nfair estate, but had never received the money, either because Kleomenes\r\nintended to cheat him, or because he was unable to pay him on account of\r\nthe wars. As this man was disembarking from his ship, Kleomenes, who\r\nhappened to be walking upon the quay, saw him, and at once warmly\r\ngreeted him, and inquired what business had brought him to Egypt.\r\nNikagoras returned his salutation with equal friendliness, and said that\r\nhe had brought over some fine horses for the king's use in the wars. At\r\nthis Kleomenes laughed, and said, \"I had rather you had brought\r\nsinging-girls or beautiful boys, for they are what please the king\r\nbest.\" Nikagoras listened to this remark with a smile, but a few days\r\nafterwards he reminded Kleomenes of the estate which he had bought, and\r\nasked him to pay the price, saying that he would not have pressed for it\r\nif he had not sustained losses on his cargo. As Kleomenes replied that\r\nall his pension from the king was spent, Nikagoras in a rage repeated to\r\nSosibius the sarcasm which he had used. Sosibius was much pleased to\r\nhear of it, but as he wished to have some graver matter of which to\r\naccuse him to the king, he persuaded Nikagoras to write a letter before\r\nhe left Egypt, accusing Kleomenes of a design to make himself master of\r\nCyrene, if the king put him in possession of a fleet and army. Nikagoras\r\nwrote the letter, and sailed away to Greece; and after forty days\r\nSosibius took the letter and showed it to Ptolemy, as though he had just\r\nreceived it. By this means he so wrought upon the young king's mind,\r\nthat he confined Kleomenes in a large house, and placed a guard before\r\nall the doors, although he continued to allow him his pension as before.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. This treatment was in itself sufficiently grievous to Kleomenes,\r\nand made him fear that something worse was in store. Now Ptolemy, the\r\nson of Chrysermes, who was a friend of the king's, had always been on\r\ngood terms with Kleomenes, and they had been in the habit of conversing\r\nfamiliarly together. This man now, at Kleomenes's own request, came to\r\nsee him, and talked amicably with him, explaining away all which had\r\nappeared suspicious about the king's conduct. As he was leaving the\r\nhouse, without noticing that Kleomenes had followed him to the door, he\r\nharshly reproved the guard for keeping such careless watch over so great\r\nand savage a monster. Kleomenes himself heard him say this, and before\r\nPtolemy observed him, retired and told his friends what he had heard.\r\nThey at once abandoned all hope, and fiercely determined to avenge\r\nthemselves on Ptolemy for his wickedness and arrogance, and die as\r\nbecame Spartans, not wait to be butchered like fat cattle. They thought\r\nthat it was intolerable that Kleomenes should have disdained to make\r\nterms with Antigonus, who was a soldier and a man of action, and should\r\nsit waiting for the pleasure of a timbrel-playing king, who as soon as\r\nhe was at leisure from his kettle-drummings and revellings, intended to\r\nmurder him.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. As soon as they had formed this resolution, as it happened that\r\nPtolemy had gone to Canopus, they spread a report that the king had\r\ngiven orders for the guard to be removed. Next, observing the custom of\r\nthe kings of Egypt, which was to send a dinner and various presents to\r\nthose who are about to be released from confinement, the friends of\r\nKleomenes prepared many presents of this kind and sent them to him,\r\ndeceiving the guard, who believed that they had been sent by the king.\r\nKleomenes offered sacrifice, and gave the soldiers on guard an ample\r\nshare of the meat, while he himself put on a garland and feasted with\r\nhis friends. It is said that they proceeded to action sooner than had\r\nbeen originally intended, because Kleomenes perceived that one of the\r\nservants who was in the plot had left the house, though he had only gone\r\nto visit his mistress. Fearing that he meant to denounce them, as soon\r\nas it was noon, and the guard were sleeping off their wine, Kleomenes\r\nput on his tunic, slit up the seam over the right shoulder, seized his\r\nnaked sword, and sallied forth with his friends similarly arrayed,\r\nthirteen in all. One of them named Hippitas, who was lame, came boldly\r\nout with the rest, but finding that they proceeded slowly to enable him\r\nto keep up with them, begged them to kill him, and not spoil their plot\r\nby waiting for a useless man. It happened that one of the Alexandrians\r\nwas leading a horse past the door; they at once took it, placed Hippitas\r\non its back, and ran quickly through the streets, calling upon the\r\npopulace to rise and set itself free. The people, it appears, had spirit\r\nenough to admire Kleomenes, but no one dared to follow or help him.\r\nThree of the conspirators met Ptolemy, the son of Chrysermes, coming out\r\nof the palace, and killed him: and when another Ptolemy, the governor of\r\nthe city, drove towards them in a chariot, they rushed to meet him,\r\nscattered his bodyguard, dragged him out of the chariot and killed him.\r\nThey now made their way to the citadel, intending to break open the\r\nprison and make use of the prisoners to swell their numbers; but the\r\nguardians of the prison had closed the gates effectually before they\r\narrived, and Kleomenes, failing in this attempt, roamed through the city\r\nwithout finding any one to join him, as all fled in terror at his\r\napproach. At last he stopped, and said to his friends, \"No wonder women\r\nbear rule in a city where men fear to be free.\" He now bade them all end\r\ntheir lives worthily of him and of themselves. First of all Hippitas, at\r\nhis own request, was struck dead by one of the younger men; after which,\r\neach man deliberately and fearlessly inflicted upon himself a mortal\r\nstab, with the exception of Panteus, who had been the first to break\r\ninto the city of Megalopolis. This man, the handsomest and best warrior\r\nof all the Spartan youth, was especially loved by the king, and was\r\nordered by him to wait till all the rest were dead, and then to put an\r\nend to his life. When they had all fallen, Panteus pricked each man with\r\nhis dagger, to make certain that none of them were alive. When he\r\npricked Kleomenes in the ankle he saw his face contract. He kissed him\r\nand sat down beside him until he was quite dead, and then, embracing the\r\ncorpse, killed himself upon it.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. Thus perished Kleomenes, after having reigned over Sparta for\r\nthirteen years, as described above. The news of his death was soon\r\nbruited abroad, and Kratesiklea, although a woman of high spirit, was so\r\novercome by her misfortune that she embraced the children and wept for\r\nKleomenes. Upon this the eldest boy leaped up, and before any one knew\r\nwhat he was going to do, threw himself headlong from the roof of the\r\nhouse. He was much hurt, but not killed, and was taken up, crying out\r\nand reproaching his friends because they would not allow him to die.\r\nWhen Ptolemy heard the news, he ordered the corpse of Kleomenes to be\r\nflayed and exposed on a gibbet, and his children, his mother, and her\r\nattendants to be put to death. Among these was the wife of Panteus, the\r\nfairest and noblest-looking of them all. She and her husband had only\r\nrecently been married when their misfortunes began. When Panteus left\r\nSparta she wished to accompany him, but her parents would not allow her\r\nto do so, and locked her up in their house. But she shortly afterwards\r\nprocured a horse and a little money, and made her escape by night. She\r\nrode all the way to Taenarum, where she found a ship about to sail to\r\nEgypt, on board of which she crossed the sea, joined her husband, and\r\ncheerfully shared his exile. She now, when the soldiers came to lead\r\naway Kratesiklea, took her by the hand, held up the train of her dress,\r\nand bade her be of good courage; although Kratesiklea herself was not\r\nafraid to die, but only asked one favour, that she might die before her\r\nchildren. When they arrived at the place of execution, the children were\r\nfirst killed before the eyes of Kratesiklea, and then she herself. All\r\nshe said was: \"My children, whither have you come?\" The wife of Panteus,\r\nbeing a tall and robust woman, girded up her robe, and arranged each of\r\nthe corpses as decently as her means permitted. After she had paid the\r\nlast offices to each of them she prepared herself for death, bared her\r\nneck, allowed no one to approach her but the executioner, and died like\r\na heroine, without requiring any one to arrange her corpse. Thus the\r\nmodesty which she had observed throughout her life, did not desert her\r\neven when she was dead.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Thus gloriously, even during its last days, did Lacedæmon, whose\r\nwomen are taught to vie with men in courage, prove that virtue is\r\nsuperior to Fortune. A few days afterwards, those who were watching the\r\nbody of Kleomenes as it hung upon the gibbet, observed a large snake\r\nwhich wound its body round his head and covered his face, so that no\r\nravenous bird could alight upon it. On hearing this, the king was struck\r\nwith superstitious terror, fearing that he had offended the gods by the\r\nmurder of one who was evidently a favourite of Heaven, and something\r\nmore than mortal. All the ladies of his court began to offer sacrifices\r\nof atonement for his sin, and the people of Alexandria went to the place\r\nand worshipped Kleomenes as a hero and child of the gods, until they\r\nwere restrained by the learned, who explained that as from the corrupted\r\nbodies of oxen are bred bees, from horses wasps, and from asses beetles,\r\nso human bodies, by the melting and gathering together of the juices of\r\nthe marrow, produce serpents. This was observed by the ancients, who\r\ntherefore considered that of all animals the serpent was peculiarly\r\nappropriated to heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF TIBERIUS GRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Having finished the first History,[20] it remains to contemplate\r\nequal calamities in the pair of Roman Lives, in a comparison of Tiberius\r\nand Caius Gracchus with Agis and Kleomenes.[21] Tiberius and Caius were\r\nthe sons of Tiberius Gracchus,[22] who was censor and twice consul, and\r\ncelebrated two triumphs, but was still more distinguished for his\r\npersonal character, to which he owed the honour of having for his wife\r\nCornelia, the daughter of Scipio,[23] the conqueror of Hannibal, whom he\r\nmarried after Scipio's death, though Tiberius had not been a friend of\r\nScipio, but rather a political opponent. A story is told that Tiberius\r\nonce caught a couple of snakes[24] in his bed, and the diviners, after\r\nconsulting on the matter, told him that he must not kill both nor yet\r\nlet both go; as to the male, they said, if it were killed, the death of\r\nTiberius would follow, and if the female were killed, Cornelia would\r\ndie. Now Tiberius, who loved his wife and thought it would be more\r\nsuitable for him to die first, as he was an elderly man and his wife was\r\nstill young, killed the male snake and let the female go; and he died\r\nno long time after, leaving twelve children by Cornelia. Cornelia\r\nundertook the care of her family and her husband's property, and showed\r\nherself so prudent, so fond of her children, and of so exalted a\r\ncharacter, that Tiberius was judged to have done well in dying in place\r\nof such a wife. And though Ptolemæus,[25] the king of Egypt, invited\r\nCornelia to share his crown, and wooed her for his wife, she refused the\r\noffer and continued a widow. All her children died before her, except\r\none daughter, who married the younger Scipio,[26] and two sons, of whom\r\nI am going to speak, Tiberius and Caius, who were brought up by their\r\nmother so carefully that they became, beyond dispute, the most\r\naccomplished of all the Roman youth, which they owed, perhaps, more to\r\ntheir excellent education than even to their natural good qualities.\r\n\r\nII. Now as the figures of the Dioscuri,[27] whether sculptured or\r\npainted, though resembling one another, still present such an amount of\r\ndifference as appears when we contrast a boxer with a runner, so in\r\nthese two youths, with all their resemblance in courage, temperance,\r\ngenerous temper, eloquence, and magnanimity, yet great contrasts also in\r\ntheir actions and polity blossomed forth, so to speak, and displayed\r\nthemselves, which I think it well to set forth. First in the character\r\nand expression of his countenance, and in his movements, Tiberius was\r\nmild and sedate; Caius was animated and impetuous. When Tiberius\r\nharangued the people, he would stand composedly on one spot; but Caius\r\nwas the first Roman who moved about on the rostra[28] and pulled his\r\ntoga from his shoulder while he was speaking, as Kleon[29] the Athenian\r\nis said to have been the first popular orator at Athens who threw his\r\ncloak from him and struck his thigh. The manner of Caius was\r\nawe-striking and vehemently impassioned; the manner of Tiberius was more\r\npleasing and calculated to stir the sympathies: the language of Tiberius\r\nwas pure and elaborated to great nicety; that of Caius was persuasive\r\nand exuberant. In like manner, in his mode of life and his table,\r\nTiberius was frugal and simple; compared with others, Caius was moderate\r\nand austere, but, contrasted with his brother, luxurious and curious, as\r\nwe see by Drusus charging him with buying silver dolphins[30] at the\r\nprice of twelve hundred and fifty drachmæ for every pound that they\r\nweighed. The differences in their character corresponded to their\r\nrespective styles of speaking: Tiberius was moderate and mild; Caius was\r\nrough and impetuous, and it often happened that in his harangues he was\r\ncarried away by passion, contrary to his judgment, and his voice became\r\nshrill, and he fell to abuse, and grew confused in his discourse. To\r\nremedy this fault, he employed Licinius, a well-educated slave, who used\r\nto stand behind him when he was speaking, with a musical instrument,[31]\r\nsuch as is used as an accompaniment to singing, and whenever he\r\nobserved that the voice of Caius was becoming harsh and broken through\r\npassion, he would produce a soft note, upon which Caius would\r\nimmediately moderate his vehemence and his voice, and become calm.\r\n\r\nIII. Such were the contrasts between the two brothers, but in courage\r\nagainst the enemy, in justice to the subject nations, in vigilance in\r\nthe discharge of public duties, and in self-control over indulgence,\r\nthey were both alike. Tiberius was the elder by nine years, a\r\ncircumstance which caused their political career to be separated by an\r\ninterval, and greatly contributed to the failure of their measures, for\r\nthey did not rise to eminence at the same time nor unite their strength\r\nin one effort, which from their union, would have been powerful and\r\nirresistible. I must accordingly speak of each separately, and of the\r\nelder first.\r\n\r\nIV. Immediately on attaining man's estate, Tiberius had so great a\r\nreputation that he was elected a member of the college of augurs,[32]\r\nrather for his excellent qualities than his noble birth. Appius\r\nClaudius,[33] a man of consular and censorian rank, who in consideration\r\nof his dignity was appointed Princeps Senatus,[34] and in loftiness of\r\ncharacter surpassed all his contemporaries, showed his opinion of\r\nTiberius; for when the augurs were feasting together, Appius addressed\r\nTiberius with many expressions of friendship, and solicited him to take\r\nhis daughter to wife. Tiberius gladly accepted the proposal, and the\r\nagreement was forthwith made. As Appius was entering the door on his\r\nreturn home, he called out to his wife in a loud voice, \"Antistia, I\r\nhave given our daughter Claudia to wife.\" Antistia in surprise replied,\r\n\"What is the need or the hurry, unless you have got Tiberius Gracchus\r\nfor her husband?\" I am aware that some writers tell this story of\r\nTiberius the father of the Gracchi and of Scipio Africanus; but the\r\nmajority have the story as I give it, and Polybius[35] says that after\r\nthe death of Scipio Africanus, his kinsmen selected Tiberius to be the\r\nhusband of Cornelia, and that she had neither been given in marriage nor\r\nbetrothed by her father in his lifetime. Now the younger Tiberius served\r\nin the army in Africa[36] with the second Scipio,[37] who had married\r\nhis sister, and by living in the general's tent he soon learned his\r\ncharacter, which exhibited many and great qualities for virtuous\r\nemulation and practical imitation. Tiberius, also, soon surpassed all\r\nthe young soldiers in attention to discipline and in courage; and he was\r\nthe first to mount the enemy's wall, as Fannius[38] says, who also\r\nasserts that he mounted the wall with Tiberius and shared the honour\r\nwith him. While he was in the army Tiberius won the affection of all the\r\nsoldiers, and was regretted when he went away.\r\n\r\nV. After that expedition he was elected quæstor,[39] and it fell to his\r\nlot to serve in that capacity under the consul Caius Mancinus,[40] no\r\nbad man, but the most unlucky of Roman generals. Accordingly in adverse\r\nfortune and critical affairs the prudence and courage of Tiberius became\r\nthe more conspicuous, and not only his prudence and courage, but what\r\nwas truly admirable, his consideration and respect for his general,\r\nwhose reverses almost made him forget who he was. Having been defeated\r\nin several great battles, Mancinus attempted to leave his camp by night\r\nand make a retreat. The Numantines, however, perceived his movements,\r\nand immediately seizing the camp, fell on the Romans in their flight and\r\nkilled those in the rear; and at last, when they were surrounding the\r\nwhole army and driving them to unfavourable ground, from which escape\r\nwas impossible, Mancinus, despairing of all chance of saving himself by\r\nresistance, sent to treat for a truce and terms of peace. But the\r\nNumantines declared that they would trust nobody except Tiberius, and\r\nthey bade Mancinus send him. The Numantines had come to this resolution\r\nas well from a knowledge of the young man's character, for there was\r\nmuch talk about him in this campaign, as from the remembrance of his\r\nfather Tiberius, who, after carrying on war against the Iberians and\r\nsubduing many of them, made peace with the Numantines, and always kept\r\nthe Roman people to a fair and just observance of it. Accordingly\r\nTiberius was sent, and had a conference with the Numantines, in which he\r\ngot some favourable conditions, and, by making some concessions,\r\nobtained a truce, and thus saved twenty thousand Roman citizens, besides\r\nthe slaves and camp-followers.\r\n\r\nVI. All the property that was taken in the camp became the booty of the\r\nNumantines; and among it were the tablets of Tiberius, which contained\r\nthe entries and accounts of his administration as quæstor. Being very\r\nanxious to recover them, though the army had already advanced some\r\ndistance, he returned to the city with three or four companions, and\r\ncalling forth the magistrates of Numantia, he begged to have back his\r\ntablets, in order that his enemies might not have an opportunity of\r\ncalumniating him if he should not be able to give an account of his\r\nadministration of the public money. The Numantines were pleased at the\r\nopportunity of doing him a service, and invited him to enter the city;\r\nand when he stood hesitating, they came near and clung to his hands, and\r\nwere urgent in entreating him not to consider them as enemies any\r\nlonger, but as friends, and to trust them. Tiberius determined to do so,\r\nas he was very anxious to get the tablets, and feared to irritate the\r\nNumantines if he should seem to distrust them. When he had entered the\r\ncity, the first thing they did was to prepare an entertainment, and to\r\nurge him most importunately to sit down and eat with them. They\r\nafterwards gave him back the tablets, and bade him take anything else he\r\nliked. Tiberius, however, would have nothing except the frankincense\r\nwhich he wanted for the public sacrifices, and after a friendly embrace\r\nhe took his leave of them.\r\n\r\nVII. On his return to Rome, the whole transaction was greatly blamed as\r\ndishonourable and disgraceful to Rome. The kinsfolk and friends of the\r\nsoldiers, who were a large part of the people, crowded about Tiberius,\r\ncharging the general with the disgraceful part of what had happened, and\r\ndeclaring that Tiberius had been the saviour of so many citizens. Those\r\nwho were the most vexed at the events in Iberia,[41] recommended that\r\nthey should follow the example of their ancestors; for in former times\r\nthe Romans stripped of their clothes and delivered up to the\r\nSamnites[42] those who had purchased their safety on dishonourable\r\nterms, both the generals and all who had any share or participation in\r\nthe treaty, quæstors and tribunes all alike, and on their heads they\r\nturned the violation of the oaths and the infraction of the agreement.\r\nIt was on this occasion particularly, that the people showed their\r\naffection and zeal towards Tiberius: for they decided to deliver up the\r\nconsul, stripped and in chains, to the Numantines, but they spared all\r\nthe rest on account of Tiberius. It appears that Scipio also, who was\r\nthen the most powerful man in Rome, gave his assistance in this matter,\r\nbut nevertheless he was blamed for not saving Mancinus, and not making\r\nany exertion to ratify the treaty with the Numantines, which had been\r\nconcluded by his relation and friend Tiberius. But whatever difference\r\nthere was between Scipio and Tiberius on this occasion, perhaps\r\noriginated mainly in jealousy and was owing to the friends of Tiberius\r\nand the sophists, who endeavoured to prejudice him against Scipio. There\r\nwas, however, no irreconcilable breach made between them, and no bad\r\nresult from this affair; indeed, it seems to me that Tiberius would\r\nnever have been involved in those political measures which cost him his\r\nlife, if Scipio Africanus had been at Rome while they were going on. But\r\nit was while Scipio was carrying on the war at Numantia[43] that\r\nTiberius commenced his legislation, to which he was led from the\r\nfollowing motives.\r\n\r\nVIII. Whatever territory the Romans acquired from their neighbours in\r\nwar, they sold part, and retaining the other part as public\r\nproperty,[44] they gave it to the poorer citizens to cultivate, on the\r\npayment of a small sum to the treasury. But as the rich began to outbid\r\nthe poor, and so to drive them out, a law was passed which forbade any\r\none to have more than five hundred jugera of land. This law restrained\r\nthe greediness of the rich for a short time, and was a relief to the\r\npoor, who remained on the land which they had hired, and cultivated the\r\nseveral portions which they originally had. But in course of time their\r\nrich neighbours contrived to transfer the holdings to themselves in the\r\nnames of other persons, and at last openly got possession of the greater\r\npart of the public lands in their own names, and the poor, being\r\nexpelled, were not willing to take military service and were careless\r\nabout bringing up families, in consequence of which there was speedily a\r\ndiminution in the number of freemen all through Italy, and the country\r\nwas filled with ergastula[45] of barbarian slaves, with whom the rich\r\ncultivated the lands from which they had expelled the citizens. Now\r\nCaius Lælius,[46] the friend of Scipio, attempted to remedy this\r\nmischief, but he desisted through fear of the disturbances that were\r\nthreatened by the opposition of the rich, whence he got the name of wise\r\nor prudent, for such is the signification of the Roman word \"sapiens.\"\r\nTiberius, on being elected tribune,[47] immediately undertook the same\r\nmeasures, as most say, at the instigation of the orator Diophanes and\r\nthe philosopher Blossius.[48] Diophanes was an exile from Mitylene:\r\nBlossius was an Italian from Cumæ, and had been an intimate at Rome with\r\nAntipater of Tarsus, who had done him the honour of dedicating to him\r\nsome of his philosophical writings. Some give part of the blame to\r\nCornelia also, the mother of Tiberius, who frequently reproached her\r\nsons that the Romans still called her the mother-in-law of Scipio, but\r\nnot yet the mother of the Gracchi. Others say that jealousy of one\r\nSpurius Postumius,[49] a contemporary of Tiberius, and a rival of his\r\nreputation as an orator, was the immediate motive: for it is said that\r\nwhen Tiberius returned to Rome from his military service, he found that\r\nPostumius had far out-stripped him in reputation and influence, and\r\nseeing the distinction that Postumius had attained, he determined to get\r\nthe advantage over him by engaging in measures which were attended with\r\nhazard, but promised great results. But his brother Caius in a certain\r\nbook has recorded, that as Tiberius was passing through Tyrrhenia\r\n(Tuscany), on his road to Numantia, he observed the deserted state of\r\nthe country, and that the cultivators and shepherds were foreign slaves\r\nand barbarians; and that he then for the first time conceived those\r\npolitical measures which to them were the beginning of infinite\r\ncalamities. But the energy and ambition of Tiberius were mainly excited\r\nby the people, who urged him by writing on the porticoes, the walls, and\r\non the tombs, to recover the public land for the poor.\r\n\r\nIX. He did not, however, draw up the law without assistance, but took\r\nthe advice of the citizens most eminent for character and reputation,\r\namong whom were Crassus[50] the pontifex maximus, Mucius Scævola,[51]\r\nthe jurist, who was then consul, and Claudius Appius, his father-in-law.\r\nNever was a measure directed against such wrong and aggression conceived\r\nin more moderate and gentle terms; for though the rich well deserved to\r\nbe punished for their violation of law and to be compelled to surrender\r\nunder penalties the land which they had been illegally enjoying, the law\r\nmerely declared that they should give up their unjust acquisitions upon\r\nbeing paid the value of them, and should allow the lands to be occupied\r\nby the citizens who were in want of this relief. Though the reform of\r\nthis abuse was so moderate and reasonable, the people were satisfied to\r\ntake no notice of the past and to secure themselves against wrong for\r\nthe future. But the rich and those who had possessions detested the\r\nproposed law because of their greediness, and the proposer of it was the\r\nobject of their indignation and jealousy; and accordingly they attempted\r\nto divert the people from the measure, by insinuating that Tiberius was\r\nproposing a division of land merely to disturb the state and to bring\r\nabout a revolution. But they failed altogether; for Tiberius, supporting\r\na measure in itself honourable and just, with an eloquence[52]\r\ncalculated to set off even a meaner subject, showed his power and his\r\nsuperiority over his opponents, whenever the people were crowded round\r\nthe rostra and he addressed them about the poor. \"The wild beasts of\r\nItaly,\" he would say, \"had their dens and holes and hiding-places, while\r\nthe men who fought and died in defence of Italy enjoyed, indeed, the air\r\nand the light, but nothing else: houseless and without a spot of ground\r\nto rest upon, they wander about with their wives and children, while\r\ntheir commanders, with a lie in their mouth, exhort the soldiers in\r\nbattle to defend their tombs and temples against the enemy, for out of\r\nso many Romans not one has a family altar or ancestral tomb, but they\r\nfight to maintain the luxury and wealth of others, and they die with the\r\ntitle of lords of the earth,[53] without possessing a single clod to\r\ncall their own.\"\r\n\r\nX. Such language as this, proceeding from a lofty spirit and genuine\r\nfeeling, and delivered to the people, who were vehemently excited and\r\nroused, none of the enemies of Tiberius attempted to refute.\r\nAbandoning, therefore, all idea of opposing him by words, they addressed\r\nthemselves to Marcus Octavius,[54] one of the tribunes, a young man of\r\nsober and orderly disposition, and a companion and friend of Tiberius.\r\nAt first Octavius, from regard to Tiberius, evaded the proposals, but\r\nbeing urged and importuned by many of the powerful nobles,[55] and as\r\nit were, driven to it, he set himself in opposition to Tiberius, and\r\nprevented the passing of the law. Now all the power is virtually in the\r\nhands of the dissentient tribune, for the rest can do nothing if a\r\nsingle tribune oppose them. Irritated at this, Tiberius withdrew his\r\nmoderate measure and introduced another, more agreeable to the people\r\nand more severe against the illegal possessors of land; this new measure\r\nejected persons out of the lands which they had got possession of\r\ncontrary to existing laws. There was a daily contest between him and\r\nOctavius at the rostra, but though they opposed one another with great\r\nearnestness and rivalry, it is said they never uttered a disparaging\r\nword against one another, and that no unbecoming expression ever escaped\r\neither of them against the other. It is not, then, in bacchanalian\r\nrevelries[56] only, as it seems, but also in ambitious rivalry and\r\npassion, that to be of noble nature and to have been well brought up,\r\nrestrains and governs the mind. Tiberius, observing that Octavius\r\nhimself was obnoxious to the law and possessed a considerable tract of\r\nthe public land, begged him to desist from his opposition, offering to\r\npay him the value of the land out of his own purse, though he was by no\r\nmeans in affluent circumstances. Upon Octavius rejecting the proposal,\r\nTiberius by an edict forbade all the other magistrates to transact any\r\npublic business until the people had voted upon his law; and he placed\r\nhis private seals on the temple of Saturn,[57] that the quæstors might\r\nnot be able to take anything out of it or pay anything in, and he gave\r\npublic notice that a penalty would be imposed on the prætors if they\r\ndisobeyed; in consequence of which all the magistrates were afraid and\r\nceased from discharging their several functions. Upon this the\r\npossessors changed their dress and went about the Forum in a piteous and\r\nhumble guise, but in secret they plotted against Tiberius and\r\nendeavoured to procure assassins to take him off; in consequence of\r\nwhich, Tiberius, as everybody knew, wore under his dress a short sword,\r\nsuch as robbers use, which the Romans call dolo.[58]\r\n\r\nXI. When the day came and Tiberius was calling the people to the vote,\r\nthe voting-urns[59] were seized by the rich and the proceedings were\r\nput into great confusion. However, as the partisans of Tiberius, who had\r\nthe superiority in numbers, were collecting in order to make resistance,\r\nManlius[60] and Fulvius, both consular men, falling down at the knees of\r\nTiberius, and clinging to his hands with tears, begged him to desist.\r\nTiberius, seeing that matters were near coming to extremities, and from\r\nregard to the men also, asked them what they would have him do; to which\r\nthey replied, that they were not competent to advise on so important a\r\nmatter, and they urged him to refer it to the senate, and at last he\r\nconsented. The senate met, but did nothing, owing to the opposition of\r\nthe rich, who had great influence in the body; upon which Tiberius had\r\nrecourse to the unconstitutional and violent measure of depriving\r\nOctavius of his office, finding it impossible to put his proposed law to\r\nthe vote in any other way. In the first place, he publicly entreated\r\nOctavius, addressing him affectionately and clinging to his hands, to\r\nyield to and gratify the people, who asked for nothing but their rights,\r\nand would only get a small matter in return for great dangers and\r\nsufferings. Octavius rejected this proposition; upon which Tiberius\r\nreminded him that both of them were magistrates and were contending with\r\nequal power on a weighty matter, and that it was not possible for this\r\nstruggle to continue without coming to open hostility; that he saw no\r\nremedy except for one of them to give up his office; and he bade\r\nOctavius put it to the people to vote on his case first, and said that\r\nhe would immediately descend to the station of a private man, if the\r\ncitizens should desire it. As Octavius refused this proposal also,\r\nTiberius said that he would put the question about Octavius retiring\r\nfrom the tribunate to the people, if Octavius did not change his\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nXII. Thus ended the assembly of that day. On the following day Tiberius\r\nmounted the rostra and again endeavoured to persuade Octavius; but as he\r\nwould not yield, Tiberius proposed a law by which Octavius should be\r\ndeprived of his tribunate, and he forthwith summoned the citizens to\r\nvote upon it. Now, there were five and thirty tribes,[61] and when\r\nseventeen of them had already given their vote, and the addition of one\r\nmore tribe would reduce Octavius to a private condition, Tiberius\r\nstopped the voting, and again entreated Octavius, embracing him in the\r\npresence of the people and urgently praying him not to be careless about\r\nbeing deprived of his office, and not to bring on him the blame of so\r\nsevere and odious a measure. It is said that Octavius was not entirely\r\nuntouched or unmoved by these entreaties, and his eyes were filled with\r\ntears and he was silent for some time. But when he looked to the rich\r\nand the possessors, who were standing together in one body, through fear\r\nof losing their good opinion, as it seems, he boldly determined to run\r\nevery risk, and he told Tiberius to do what he pleased. Accordingly the\r\nlaw was passed, and Tiberius ordered one of his freedmen to drag\r\nOctavius from the rostra, for Tiberius employed his own freedmen as\r\nofficers; a circumstance which made the spectacle of Octavius dragged\r\nfrom the rostra with contumely still more deplorable. At the same time\r\nthe people made an assault on Octavius, and though the rich all ran to\r\nhis assistance and disengaged him from their hands, it was not without\r\ndifficulty that he was rescued and made his escape from the mob. But one\r\nof his faithful slaves, who had placed himself in front of his master to\r\ndefend him, had his eyes torn out. This violence was quite contrary to\r\nthe wishes of Tiberius, who, on seeing what was going on, speedily made\r\nhis way to the disturbance.\r\n\r\nXIII. The law about the land was now immediately carried, and\r\ntriumviri[62] were appointed for ascertaining its bounds and\r\ndistributing it; the triumviri were Tiberius, and his father-in-law\r\nClaudius Appius, and Caius Gracchus, his brother, who, however, was not\r\nat Rome, but serving under Scipio against Numantia. All this Tiberius\r\naccomplished quietly without any opposition, and he also procured to be\r\nelected tribune in the room of Octavius, not a person of rank, but one\r\nMucius[63] a client[64] of his own. The nobles, who were vexed at all\r\nthese measures and feared the growing power of Tiberius, treated him in\r\nthe senate with contumely; and upon his asking, according to custom, for\r\na tent from the treasury for his use while he was distributing the land,\r\nthey refused it to him, though others had often had one allowed them on\r\nless important occasions; and they only gave him for his expenses nine\r\noboli[65] a day, which was done on the motion of Publius Nasica,[66] who\r\nentered violently into the opposition against Tiberius, for he was in\r\npossession of a very large amount of public land, and was greatly\r\nannoyed at being forcibly ejected from it. But the people now became\r\nstill more violent. A friend of Tiberius happened to die suddenly, and\r\nsuspicious marks immediately showed themselves on the body. The people\r\ncried out that he was poisoned, and collecting in great numbers at the\r\nfuneral, they carried the bier and stood by while the body was burnt.\r\nAnd the suspicion of poison appeared to have some reason, for the body\r\nburst on the pile and sent forth such a quantity of corrupt humours as\r\nto quench the flame; and though a light was again applied, the body\r\nwould not burn till it was removed to another place, where, after much\r\ntrouble, the fire at last laid hold of it. Upon this Tiberius, with the\r\nview of exciting the people still more, changed his dress, and showing\r\nhis children to the people, begged that they would protect them and\r\ntheir mother, for he now despaired of his own safety.\r\n\r\nXIV. On the death of Attalus[67] Philometor, Eudemus of Pergamum brought\r\nhis will to Rome, in which the Roman people were made the king's heir.\r\nIn order to please the people, Tiberius promulgated a law to the effect\r\nthat as soon as the king's treasures were received, they should be\r\ndistributed among those who had assignments of land, in order to enable\r\nthem to stock the farms and to assist them in their cultivation. With\r\nrespect to the cities included within the kingdom of Attalus, he said\r\nthat the senate had no right to decide about them, but he would bring\r\nthe subject before the popular assembly. This measure gave violent\r\noffence to the senate, and Pompeius[68] getting up, said that he lived\r\nnear Tiberius, and so knew that Eudemus of Pergamum had given a diadem\r\nout of the royal treasures and a purple robe to Tiberius, who designed\r\nto make himself king in Rome. Quintus Metellus[69] reproached Tiberius\r\nby reminding him, that whenever his father, during his censorship, was\r\nreturning home from supper, the citizens used to put out the lights for\r\nfear it might be supposed that they were indulging too much in\r\nentertainments and drinking, but that the most insolent and needy of the\r\ncitizens accompanied Tiberius with lights at night. Titus Annius,[70]\r\nwho was not a man of good repute or sober behaviour, but in any contest\r\nof words by way of question and answer was considered to be unequalled,\r\nchallenged Tiberius to answer definitely whether he had or had not\r\nbranded with infamy his brother tribune, though by the law he was sacred\r\nand inviolable. As the question was received with signs of approbation,\r\nTiberius, hastily quitting the senate-house, convoked the people and\r\nordered Annius to be brought before them, with the intention of accusing\r\nhim. But Annius, who was much inferior to Tiberius both in eloquence and\r\nreputation, had recourse to his tricks, and called on Tiberius to answer\r\na few questions before he began his speech. Tiberius assented, and as\r\nsoon as there was silence, Annius said, \"If you intend to deprive me of\r\nmy rank, and disgrace me, and I appeal to one of your brother tribunes,\r\nand he shall come to my aid, and you shall then fall into a passion,\r\nwill you deprive him of his office?\" On this question being put, it is\r\nsaid that Tiberius, though no man was readier in words or bolder in\r\naction, was so confused that he made no reply.\r\n\r\nXV. For the present Tiberius[71] dissolved the assembly, seeing that his\r\nproceedings with respect to Octavius were not liked either by the\r\nnobles or the people, for they considered that the high and honourable\r\ndignity of the tribunate, which had been kept unimpaired up to that\r\ntime, had been destroyed and trampled upon. He made an harangue to the\r\npeople, a few of the arguments of which it will not be out of place to\r\nmention, for the purpose of showing the persuasive eloquence and the\r\nsubtlety of the man. He said that a tribune was sacred and inviolate,\r\nonly because he was dedicated to the people and was the guardian of the\r\npeople. If then a tribune should deviate from his duty and wrong the\r\npeople, abridge their power and deprive them of the opportunity of\r\nvoting, he had by his own act deprived himself of his rank, by not\r\nfulfilling the conditions on which he received it. Now we must consider\r\na tribune to be still a tribune, though he should dig down the Capitol\r\nand burn the naval arsenal. If he should commit such excesses as these,\r\nhe is a bad tribune; but if he should attempt to deprive the people of\r\ntheir power, he is not a tribune at all. And is it not a monstrous thing\r\nif a tribune shall have power to order a consul to be put in prison, and\r\nthe people shall not be able to deprive a tribune of his power when he\r\nis using it against the people who gave it to him? for both tribune and\r\nconsul are equally chosen by the people. Now the kingly office, besides\r\ncomprehending within it all civil power, is consecrated to the divinity\r\nby the discharge of the chief ceremonials of religion; and yet the state\r\nejected Tarquinius for his wrong-doing, and for the violence of one man\r\nthe ancient power which established Rome was overthrown. And what is\r\nthere at Rome so sacred, so venerated as the virgins who guard the\r\never-burning fire? but if any of them offends, she is buried alive; for\r\nwhen they sin against the gods, they no longer retain that inviolable\r\nsanctity which they have by being devoted to the gods. In like manner,\r\nneither has a tribune when he is wronging the people any right to retain\r\nthe inviolable character which he receives from the people, for he is\r\ndestroying the very power which is the origin of his own power. And\r\nindeed, if he has legally received the tribunitian power by the votes of\r\na majority of the tribes, how is it that he cannot even still more\r\nlegally be deposed by the vote of all the tribes? Now, nothing is so\r\nsacred and inviolable as things dedicated to the gods; but yet no one\r\nhas ever hindered the people from using such things, moving them, and\r\nchanging their places as they please. It is therefore legal for the\r\npeople to transfer the tribunate, as a consecrated thing, from one man\r\nto another. And that the tribunate is not an inviolable thing, nor an\r\noffice of which a man cannot be divested, is clear from this that many\r\nmagistrates have abdicated their office and prayed to be excused from it\r\nof their own free will.\r\n\r\nXVI. Such were the heads of the justification of Tiberius. His friends,\r\nseeing the threats of his enemies and their combination, thought that he\r\nought to be a candidate for the tribunate for the next year; and\r\nTiberius attempted to strengthen his popularity by promising to carry\r\nnew measures,[72] such as a diminution of the period of military\r\nservice, an appeal to the people from the judices, an intermixture of an\r\nequal number of the Equites with the Senators, from whom alone the\r\njudices were then taken; and in every way he attempted to abridge the\r\npower of the Senate, influenced rather by passion and ambition, than\r\njustice and the interests of the state. While the voting was going on,\r\nthe friends of Tiberius, seeing that their enemies were gaining the\r\nadvantage, for all the people were not present,[73] at first attempted\r\nto prolong the time by abusing the other tribunes, and next they\r\ndissolved the meeting and appointed it for the following day. Tiberius,\r\ngoing down to the Forum, supplicated the citizens in humble manner and\r\nwith tears in his eyes; he then said that he feared his enemies would\r\nbreak into his house by night and kill him, and thus he induced a great\r\nnumber of the citizens to take their station about his house and watch\r\nthere all night.\r\n\r\nXVII. At daybreak the man came to bring the birds which the Romans use\r\nin their auspices, and he threw them food. But the birds would not come\r\nout of the basket[74] with the exception of one, though the man shook it\r\nhard; and even this one would not touch the food, but after raising its\r\nleft wing and stretching out a leg it ran back to the basket. This\r\nreminded Tiberius of another omen that had happened. He had a helmet\r\nwhich he wore in battle, elaborately worked and splendid. Some snakes\r\nhad got into the helmet unobserved, and laid their eggs and hatched them\r\nthere. This made Tiberius still more uneasy about the signs from the\r\nfowls. Nevertheless he advanced up the city on hearing that the people\r\nwas assembled about the Capitol; but before he got out of the house he\r\nstumbled over the threshold, and the blow was so violent that the nail\r\nof his great toe was broken, and the blood ran out through his shoe. He\r\nhad not got far before some crows were seen fighting on the roof of a\r\nhouse on the left hand, and though a great crowd was passing by, as was\r\nnatural on such an occasion, a stone which was pushed off by one of the\r\ncrows fell by the feet of Tiberius. This made even the boldest of his\r\nadherents hesitate; but Blossius of Cumæ, who was present, said it would\r\nbe a shame and a great disgrace if Tiberius, a son of Gracchus and a\r\ngrandson of Scipio Africanus, and a defender of the Roman people should\r\nnot obey the summons of the people for fear of a crow, and that his\r\nenemies would not treat this cowardly act as a matter of ridicule, but\r\nwould make it the ground of calumniating him to the people as playing\r\nthe tyrant and treating them with contempt. At the same time many\r\npersons ran up to Tiberius with a message from his friends in the\r\nCapitol, to hasten there, as all was going on favourably. And indeed\r\neverything promised well at first, for as soon as he appeared he was\r\ngreeted with friendly cheers, and as he ascended the Capitol he was\r\njoyfully received, and the people crowded about him to prevent any\r\nstranger from approaching.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Now, Mucius began to summon the tribes again, but nothing could\r\nbe conducted with the usual forms on account of the confusion that\r\nprevailed among those who were on the outskirts of the assembly, where\r\nthey were struggling with their opponents, who were attempting to force\r\ntheir way in and mingle with the rest. At this juncture Flavius\r\nFlaccus,[75] a senator, posted himself in a conspicuous place, and as it\r\nwas not possible to make his voice heard so far, he made a signal with\r\nhis hand that he wished to say something in private to Tiberius.\r\nTiberius bade the crowd let Flaccus pass, who, with great difficulty\r\nmaking his way up to Tiberius, told him that the Senate was sitting,\r\nthat as they could not prevail on the consul, the rich were resolving to\r\nkill Tiberius themselves, and that they had armed many of their slaves\r\nand friends for this purpose.\r\n\r\nXIX. Upon Tiberius reporting this to those who were standing about him,\r\nthey forthwith tucked up their dress, and breaking the staves which the\r\nofficers use to keep the crowd back, distributed the fragments among\r\nthem and made ready to defend themselves against their assailants. While\r\nthose at a distance were wondering at what was going on, and asking what\r\nit meant, Tiberius touched his head with his hand, since his voice could\r\nnot be heard, intending thereby to signify to the people that his life\r\nwas in danger. His enemies on seeing this ran to the Senate and told\r\nthem that Tiberius was asking for a crown, and that his touching his\r\nhead was a proof of it. On this the whole body was greatly disturbed;\r\nNasica entreated the consul[76] to protect the state and put down the\r\ntyrant. The consul however answered mildly that he would not be the\r\nfirst to use violence, and that he would not take any citizen's life\r\nwithout a regular trial; if however, he said, the people should come to\r\nan illegal vote at the instigation of Tiberius, or from compulsion, he\r\nwould not respect any such decision. Upon this Nasica springing up\r\nexclaimed, \"Well then, as the consul betrays the state, do you who wish\r\nto maintain the laws follow me.\" As he uttered these words he drew the\r\nskirt of his dress over his head, and hastened to the Capitol; and the\r\nsenators who followed him, wrapping their dress about them with one\r\nhand, pushed all the people they met out of the way, no one opposing\r\nthem, from respect to their rank, but taking to flight and trampling\r\ndown one another. The followers of the senators had clubs and sticks\r\nwhich they had brought from home; but the senators seizing the fragments\r\nand legs of the benches which were broken by the people in their hurry\r\nto escape, made right to Tiberius, and struck all those who were in\r\ntheir road. The people were all put to flight or killed. As Tiberius was\r\nattempting to make his escape, some one laid hold of his dress, on which\r\nhe dropped his toga and fled in his tunic; but he stumbled over some\r\npersons who were lying on the ground and was thrown down. While he was\r\nendeavouring to rise, he received the first blow, as it is universally\r\nadmitted, from Publius Satyreius, one of his colleagues, who struck him\r\non the head with the leg of a bench. Lucius Rufus claimed the credit of\r\ngiving him the second blow, as if that were a thing to be proud of.\r\nAbove three hundred persons lost their lives by sticks and stones, but\r\nnone by the sword.\r\n\r\nXX. This is said to have been the first disturbance at Rome since the\r\nabolition of the kingly power, which ended in bloodshed and the death of\r\ncitizens. All previous disputes, though they were neither trifling nor\r\nabout trifling matters, were settled by mutual concession: the nobles\r\nyielded through fear of the people, and the people yielded from respect\r\nto the Senate. Even on this occasion it is probable that Tiberius would\r\nhave given way to persuasion without any difficulty, and still more\r\nreadily if his assailants had not come to bloodshed and blows, for those\r\nabout him were not above three thousand in number. But the combination\r\nagainst him seems to have proceeded rather from the passion and hatred\r\nof the rich citizens, than from the reasons which they alleged; and the\r\nbrutal and indecent treatment of his dead body is a proof of this. For\r\nthey would not listen to his brother's request[77] to take up the body\r\nand bury it at night, but it was thrown into the Tiber with the other\r\nbodies. And this was not all; they banished some of his friends without\r\ntrial, and others they seized and put to death, among whom was Diophanes\r\nthe orator. One Caius Villius[78] they shut up in a vessel with snakes\r\nand vipers, and thus he died. Blossius of Cumæ, being brought before the\r\nconsuls and questioned about what had passed, admitted that he had done\r\neverything at the bidding of Tiberius. On Nasica asking[79] him, \"What\r\nif Tiberius had told you to burn the Capitol?\" Blossius said, that\r\nTiberius would never have given him any such order. The same question\r\nbeing often put to him, and by several persons, he said, \"If he had\r\ncommanded me to burn the Capitol, it would have been a good deed for me\r\nto do; for Tiberius would not have given such an order unless it were\r\nfor the interest of the people.\" Blossius, however, was set at liberty,\r\nand afterwards went to Aristonikus[80] in Asia, on the ruin of whose\r\naffairs he killed himself.\r\n\r\nXXI. The Senate, under present circumstances, endeavoured to soothe the\r\npeople; they made no opposition to the distribution of the public land,\r\nand they allowed the people to elect another commissioner in place of\r\nTiberius. Having come to a vote, they elected Publius Crassus[81] a\r\nrelation of Gracchus, for his daughter Licinia was the wife of Caius\r\nGracchus. Cornelius Nepos,[82] indeed, says that Caius did not marry the\r\ndaughter of Crassus, but the daughter of Brutus[83] who triumphed over\r\nthe Lusitanians: however, the majority of writers state the matter as I\r\nhave done. Now, as the people were sore about the death of Tiberius, and\r\nwere manifestly waiting for an opportunity to be revenged, and\r\nNasica[84] was threatened with prosecutions, the Senate, fearing for his\r\nsafety, made a decree for sending him to Asia, though they had nothing\r\nfor him to do there. For when men met Nasica they did not conceal their\r\nhostility, but broke out into violence, and abused him wherever they\r\nfell in with him, calling him accursed, and tyrant, who had stained with\r\nthe blood of an inviolable and sacred functionary the most sacred and\r\nrevered of all the holy places in the city. Accordingly, Nasica left\r\nItaly, though bound by the most sacred functions, for he was Pontifex\r\nMaximus; and, rambling about despised from place to place, he died no\r\nlong time after in the neighbourhood of Pergamum. It is no wonder if\r\nNasica was so much hated by the people, when even Scipio Africanus, whom\r\nthe Romans considered inferior to no man in integrity, and loved as well\r\nas any, narrowly escaped losing the popular favour, because, on\r\nreceiving the news of the death of Tiberius, at Numantia, he exclaimed\r\nin the verse of Homer,\r\n\r\n   So perish[85] all who do the like again.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, when Caius and Fulvius asked him, before an assembly of\r\nthe people, what he thought of the death of Tiberius, he showed by his\r\nanswer that he was not pleased with the measures of Tiberius. This made\r\nthe people interrupt him with their shouts when he was speaking, as they\r\nhad never done before; and Scipio was so far transported with passion as\r\nto break out into invectives against them. But of this I have spoken\r\nmore particularly in the Life of Scipio.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CAIUS GRACCHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Caius Gracchus at first, either through fear of his enemies or with\r\nthe view of making them odious, withdrew from the Forum[87] and kept\r\nquiet at home, like a man humbled for the present, and intending for the\r\nfuture to keep aloof from public affairs; which gave occasion for some\r\npeople to say that he disliked the measures of Tiberius, and had\r\nabandoned them. He was also still quite a youth, for he was nine years\r\nyounger than his brother, and Tiberius was not thirty[88] when he was\r\nkilled. But in the course of time, as his character gradually displayed\r\nitself in his aversion to indolence, luxury, wine, and all matters of\r\nprivate profit, and it was clear, from his application to the study of\r\neloquence, that he was preparing, as it were, his pinions for public\r\nlife, and that he would not remain quiet; and further, when he showed by\r\nhis defence of Vettius, one of his friends, who was under prosecution,\r\nthe people all around him being wild and frantic with delight, that the\r\nrest of the orators were mere children, the nobles were again alarmed,\r\nand there was much talk among them that they would not allow Caius to\r\nobtain the tribunate. It happened without any set design that the lot\r\nfell on him to go as quæstor to Sardinia,[89] under Orestes[90] the\r\nconsul, which pleased his enemies, and was not disagreeable to Caius.\r\nFor he was fond of war, and equally disciplined for military service and\r\nspeaking in the courts of justice; but he still shrunk from public\r\naffairs and the Rostra, and as he could not resist the invitations of\r\nthe people and his friends, he was well pleased with this opportunity of\r\nleaving Rome. It is true it is a common opinion that Caius was a pure\r\ndemagogue, and much more greedy of popular favour than Tiberius. But it\r\nwas not so in fact, and Caius seems to have been involved in public\r\naffairs rather through a kind of necessity than choice. Cicero the\r\norator also says that Caius declined all offices, and had determined to\r\nlive in retirement, but that his brother appeared to him in a dream,[91]\r\nand said, \"Caius, why do you linger? There is no escape: one life for\r\nboth of us, and one death in defence of the people is our fate.\"\r\n\r\nII. Now, Caius during his stay in Sardinia exhibited his excellent\r\nqualities in every way; he far surpassed all the young men in military\r\ncourage, in upright conduct to the subject people, in loyalty and\r\nrespect to the commander; and in temperance, frugality, and attention to\r\nhis duties he excelled even his elders. The winter having been severe\r\nand unhealthy in Sardinia, the general demanded clothing for his\r\nsoldiers from the cities, upon which they sent to Rome to pray to be\r\nrelieved from this imposition. The Senate granted their petition, and\r\nordered the general to get supplies for the troops by other means; but\r\nas the general was unable to do this, and the soldiers were suffering,\r\nCaius went round to the cities and induced them voluntarily to send\r\nclothing and to assist the Romans. This, being reported to Rome, made\r\nthe Senate uneasy, for they viewed it as a preliminary to popular\r\nagitation. Ambassadors also arrived at Rome from Libya, with a message\r\nfrom King Micipsa,[92] that the king had sent corn to the commander in\r\nSardinia, out of respect for Caius Gracchus. The Senate, taking offence\r\nat the message, would not receive the ambassadors, and they passed a\r\ndecree that fresh troops should be sent out to replace those in\r\nSardinia, but that Orestes should stay; intending by this measure to\r\nkeep Caius there also, in respect of his office. On this being done,\r\nCaius immediately set sail in a passion, and appearing at Rome contrary\r\nto all expectation, was not only blamed by his enemies, but even the\r\npeople considered it a strange thing for the quæstor to leave his\r\ngeneral behind. However, when the matter was brought before the\r\nCensors,[93] he asked for permission to make his defence, and he\r\nproduced such a change in the opinions of his audience, that he was\r\nacquitted, and considered to have been exceedingly ill used: he said\r\nthat he had served in the army for twelve years, while others were only\r\nrequired to serve ten years, and that he had exercised the functions of\r\nquæstor to the commander for three years, though the law allowed him to\r\nreturn after one year's service; he added that he was the only soldier\r\nwho took out a full purse with him and brought it back empty, while the\r\nrest took out with them only jars of wine, which they had emptied in\r\nSardinia, and brought them back full of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIII. After this, his enemies brought fresh charges against him, and\r\nharassed him with prosecutions on the ground of causing the defection of\r\nthe allies and having participated in the conspiracy which had been\r\ndetected at Fregellæ.[94] But he cleared himself of all suspicion, and\r\nhaving established his innocence, immediately set about canvassing for\r\nthe tribunate. All the men of distinction, without exception, opposed\r\nhim; and so great a multitude flocked to Rome from all parts of Italy,\r\nto the Comitia, that many of them could not find lodgings, and the\r\nCampus Martius[95] being unable to contain the numbers, they shouted\r\nfrom the house-tops and tilings. However, the nobility so far prevailed\r\nagainst the people as to disappoint the hopes of Caius, inasmuch as he\r\nwas not returned first, as he expected, but only fourth. But upon\r\nentering on his office he soon made himself first, for he surpassed\r\nevery Roman in eloquence,[96] and his misfortunes gave him a licence\r\nfor speaking freely when lamenting the fate of his brother. He took\r\nevery opportunity of directing the thoughts of the people to this\r\nsubject, reminding them of former times, and contrasting the conduct of\r\ntheir ancestors, who went to war with the Falisci on behalf of Gemicius,\r\na tribune, who had been insulted by them, and condemned Caius Veturius\r\nto death because he was the only man that did not make way for a tribune\r\nas he was passing through the Forum. \"But before your eyes,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"these men beat Tiberius to death with staves, and his body\r\nwas dragged through the midst of the city to be thrown into the Tiber;\r\nand all his friends who were caught were put to death without trial. And\r\nyet it is an old usage among us, if a man is accused of a capital charge\r\nand does not appear, for a trumpeter to come to the door of his house in\r\nthe morning and summon him by the sound of the trumpet, and the judices\r\ncannot vote upon the charge till this has been done. So circumspect and\r\ncareful were the Romans of old in the trials of persons accused.\"\r\n\r\nIV. Having first stirred up the people by such harangues as these (and\r\nhe had a very loud voice, and was most vigorous in speech), he\r\npromulgated two laws:[97] one, to the effect that if the people had\r\ndeprived any magistrate of his office, he should be incapacitated from\r\nholding office a second time; and the other, which rendered a magistrate\r\nliable to a public prosecution if he had banished any citizen without\r\ntrial. One of these rogations had the direct effect of branding with\r\ninfamy Marcus Octavius, who had been deprived of the tribunate by\r\nTiberius; and Popillius[98] came within the penalties of the other, for\r\nduring his prætorship he had banished the friends of Tiberius. Popillius\r\ndid not stand his trial, and he fled from Italy; but the other law Caius\r\nhimself withdrew, saying that he refrained from touching Octavius at the\r\nrequest of his mother Cornelia. The people admired his conduct on this\r\noccasion, and gave their consent, for they respected Cornelia no less\r\nfor the sake of her sons than her father; and afterwards they set up a\r\nbronze statue[99] of her, with the inscription--Cornelia, Mother of the\r\nGracchi. There are recorded several things that Caius said in defence of\r\nhis mother in a rhetorical and coarse way, in reply to one of his\r\nenemies. \"What,\" said he, \"do you abuse Cornelia, the mother of\r\nTiberius?\" And as the man laboured under the imputation of being a\r\ndissolute fellow, he added, \"How can you have the impudence to compare\r\nyourself with Cornelia? Have you been a mother, as she has?\"--and more to\r\nthe like effect, but still coarser. Such was the bitterness of his\r\nlanguage, and many like things occur in his writings.\r\n\r\nV. Of the laws[100] which he promulgated with the view of gaining the\r\npopular favour and weakening the Senate, one was for the establishment\r\nof colonies and the distribution of Public Land among the poor; another\r\nprovided for supplying the soldiers with clothing at the public expense,\r\nwithout any deduction on this account being made from their pay, and\r\nexempted youths under seventeen years of age from being drafted for the\r\narmy; a third was in favour of the allies, and put the Italians on the\r\nsame footing as the citizens with respect to the suffrage; another\r\nrelated to grain, and had for its object the lowering of the price for\r\nthe poor; the last related to the judices, a measure which most of all\r\nencroached on the privileges of the senate--for the senate alone supplied\r\njudices for the trials, and this privilege rendered that body formidable\r\nboth to the people and the equites. The law of Gracchus added three\r\nhundred equites to the senate, who were also three hundred in number,\r\nand it made the judices eligible out of the whole six hundred. In his\r\nendeavours to carry this law he is said to have made every exertion; and\r\nin particular it is recorded that all the popular leaders who preceded\r\nhim turned their faces to the senate and the comitium while they were\r\nspeaking, but he was the first who turned his face the other way to the\r\nForum while haranguing the people, and he continued to do so; and by a\r\nsmall deviation and alteration in attitude he stirred a great question,\r\nand in a manner transformed the government from an aristocratical to a\r\ndemocratical form, by this new attitude intimating that the orators\r\nshould direct their speeches to the many and not to the senate.\r\n\r\nVI. The people not only passed this law, but empowered Gracchus to\r\nselect from the equites those who were to act as judices, which\r\nconferred on him a kind of monarchical authority, and even the senate\r\nnow assented to the measures which he proposed in their body. But all\r\nthe measures which he proposed were honourable to the senate; such, for\r\ninstance, was the very equitable and just decree about the grain which\r\nFabius the proprætor sent from Iberia. Gracchus induced the senate to\r\nsell the grain and to return the money which it produced to the Iberian\r\ncities, and further to censure Fabius for making the Roman dominion\r\nheavy and intolerable to the subject nations; this measure brought him\r\ngreat reputation and popularity in the provinces. He also introduced\r\nmeasures for sending out colonies, the construction of roads, and the\r\nbuilding of public granaries; and he made himself director and\r\nsuperintendent for the carrying all these measures into effect. Though\r\nengaged in so many great undertakings, he was never wearied, but with\r\nwonderful activity and labour he effected every single object as if he\r\nhad for the time no other occupation, so that even those who thoroughly\r\nhated and feared him were struck with amazement at the rapidity and\r\nperfect execution of all that he undertook. But the people looked with\r\nadmiration on the man himself, seeing him attended by crowds of\r\nbuilding-contractors, artificers, ambassadors, magistrates, soldiers,\r\nand learned men, to all of whom he was easy of access; and while he\r\nmaintained his dignity, he was affable to all, and adapted his behaviour\r\nto the condition of every individual, and so proved the falsehood of\r\nthose who called him tyrannical or arrogant or violent. He thus showed\r\nhimself more skilful as a popular leader in his dealings with men, and\r\nin his conduct, than in his harangues from the Rostra.\r\n\r\nVII. But Caius busied himself most about the construction of roads,[101]\r\nhaving in view utility, convenience, and ornament. The roads were made\r\nin a straight line, right through the country, partly of quarried stone\r\nand partly with tight-rammed masses of earth. By filling up the\r\ndepressions, and throwing bridges across those parts which were\r\ntraversed by winter torrents or deep ravines, and raising the road on\r\nboth sides to the same uniform height, the whole line was made level and\r\npresented an agreeable appearance. He also measured all the roads by\r\nmiles (the Roman mile is not quite eight Greek stadia), and fixed stone\r\nblocks to mark the distances. He placed other stones at less distances\r\nfrom one another on each side of the road, that persons might thus\r\neasily mount their horses without assistance.\r\n\r\nVIII. As the people extolled him for all these services, and were ready\r\nto show their good will towards him in any way, he said on one occasion\r\nwhen he was addressing them, that he would ask a favour, which he would\r\nvalue above everything if it was granted, but if it were refused, he\r\nshould not complain. It was accordingly expected that he would ask for\r\nthe consulship, and everybody supposed that he would be a candidate for\r\nthe consulship and the tribunate at the same time. When the consular\r\ncomitia were near, and all were at the highest point of expectation,\r\nCaius appeared conducting Caius Fannius into the Campus Martius, and\r\ncanvassing with his friends for Fannius.[102] This gave Fannius a great\r\nadvantage. Fannius was elected consul, and Caius tribune for the second\r\ntime, though he was neither a candidate nor canvassed, but his election\r\nwas entirely due to the zeal of the people. Perceiving, however, that\r\nthe senate was clearly opposed to him, and that the kind feeling of\r\nFannius towards him cooled, he forthwith endeavoured to attach the\r\npeople by other measures, by proposing to send colonies to Tarentum and\r\nCapua, and by inviting the Latins to a participation in the Roman\r\nfranchise. The senate, fearing that Gracchus would become irresistible,\r\nattempted a new and unusual method of diverting the people from him, by\r\nopposing popular measures to his, and by gratifying the people, contrary\r\nto sound policy. Livius Drusus was one of the colleagues of Caius, a man\r\nby birth and education inferior to none in Rome, and in character,\r\neloquence, and wealth equal to any who enjoyed either honour or power by\r\nthe aid of these advantages. To him accordingly the chief nobles\r\napplied, and they urged him to attack Caius, and to unite with them\r\nagainst him, not by adopting violent measures, nor coming into collision\r\nwith the many, but by a course of administration adapted to please, and\r\nby making such concessions as it would have been honourable to refuse,\r\neven at the risk of unpopularity.\r\n\r\nIX. Livius, having agreed to employ his tribunitian authority on the\r\nside of the senate, framed measures which had neither any honourable nor\r\nany useful object: he only had in view to outbid Caius in the popular\r\nfavour, just as it is in a comedy, by making himself busy and vying with\r\nhis rival. This showed most clearly that the senate were not displeased\r\nwith the measures of Caius, but only wished to destroy him or completely\r\nhumble him. When Caius proposed to send out ten colonies consisting of\r\ncitizens of the best character, the senate accused him of truckling to\r\nthe people; but they co-operated with Livius, who proposed twelve\r\ncolonies, each of which was to consist of three thousand needy citizens.\r\nThey set themselves in opposition to Caius when he proposed to\r\ndistribute land among the poor, subject to a yearly payment to the\r\ntreasury from each, on the ground that he was trying to gain the popular\r\nfavour; but they were satisfied when Livius proposed to relieve the\r\ncolonists even from this payment. Further, Caius gave them offence by\r\nproposing to confer on the Latins the Roman suffrage; but when Livius\r\nbrought forward a measure which forbade any Latin to be beaten with rods\r\neven while serving in the army, they supported it. And indeed Livius\r\nhimself, in his harangues to the people, always said that he only\r\nproposed what was agreeable to the senate, who had a regard for the\r\nmany; which indeed was the only good that resulted from his measures.\r\nFor the people became more pacifically disposed towards the senate; and\r\nthough the most distinguished of them were formerly suspected and hated\r\nby the people, Livius did away with and softened their recollection of\r\npast grievances and their ill feeling, by giving out that it was in\r\naccordance with the wish of the senate that he had entered upon his\r\npopular career and framed measures to please the many.\r\n\r\nX. But the best proof to the people of the good intentions and honesty\r\nof Livius was, that he proposed nothing for himself or in behalf of his\r\nown interests; for he appointed other persons to superintend the\r\nestablishment of the colonies, and he did not meddle with the\r\nadministration of the money, while Caius had assigned to himself most of\r\nsuch functions, and the most important of them. It happened that\r\nRubrius, one of the tribunes, had proposed a measure for the\r\ncolonisation of Carthage, which had been destroyed by Scipio; and as the\r\nlot fell on Caius, he set sail to Libya to found the colony. In his\r\nabsence, Drusus, making still further advances, insinuated himself into\r\nthe favour of the people, and gained them over mainly by calumniating\r\nFulvius.[103] This Fulvius was a friend of Caius and a joint\r\ncommissioner for the distribution of lands; but he was a noisy fellow,\r\nand specially disliked by the senate; he was also suspected by others of\r\nstirring up the allies, and secretly encouraging the Italians to revolt;\r\nand though this was said without proof or inquiry, Fulvius himself gave\r\nit credit by his unwise and revolutionary policy. This more than\r\nanything else destroyed the popularity of Caius, who came in for his\r\nshare of the odium against Fulvius. And when Scipio[104] Africanus died\r\nwithout any obvious cause, and certain signs of blows and violence were\r\nsupposed to be visible on the body, as I told in the Life of Scipio, the\r\nsuspicion fell chiefly on Fulvius, who was his enemy, and on that day\r\nhad abused Scipio from the Rostra. Suspicion attached to Caius also. So\r\nabominable a crime committed against the first and greatest of the\r\nRomans went unpunished, and there was not even an inquiry; for the many\r\nopposed it and stopped the investigation through fear for Caius, lest he\r\nshould be discovered to be implicated in the murder. These events,\r\nindeed, belong to an earlier period.\r\n\r\nXI. In Libya, as to the foundation of Carthage,[105] which Caius named\r\nJunonia, which is the same as Heraea, it is said there were many\r\nsupernatural hindrances. For the first standard was seized and broken by\r\na violent gust of wind, though the standard-bearer stuck to it\r\nvigorously; and the victims which were lying on the altars were\r\ndispersed by a tempest, and scattered beyond the stakes which marked the\r\nlimits of the city, and the stakes were torn up by the wolves and\r\ncarried a long way off. However Caius, after settling and arranging\r\neverything in seventy days, returned to Rome upon hearing that Fulvius\r\nwas hard pressed by Drusus, and that affairs required his presence.\r\nLucius Opimius, a man who belonged to the faction of the oligarchs,[106]\r\nand had great influence in the senate, failed on a former occasion when\r\nhe was a candidate for the consulship, at the time when Caius brought\r\nforward Fannius and canvassed against Opimius; but now, being supported\r\nby a powerful party, it was expected that Opimius would be elected\r\nconsul and would put down Caius, whose influence was already in some\r\ndegree on the wane, and the people also were tired of such measures as\r\nhis, for there were many who sought their favour, and the senate easily\r\ngave way.\r\n\r\nXII. On his return from Libya, Caius removed from the Palatium to the\r\nneighbourhood of the Forum, as being a more popular place of residence,\r\nfor it happened that most of the lowest classes of the poor lived there;\r\nhe next promulgated the rest of his measures, intending to take the vote\r\nof the people upon them. As crowds were collecting from all parts to\r\nsupport Caius, the senate prevailed on the consul Fannius to drive out\r\nof the city all who were not Romans. Accordingly a strange and unusual\r\nproclamation was made, to the effect that none of the allies or friends\r\nof the Roman state should appear in Rome during those days; on which\r\nCaius published a counter edict, in which he criminated the consul and\r\npromised his support to the allies if they remained in Rome. But he did\r\nnot keep his promise; for though he saw one of them, who was his own\r\nfriend and intimate, dragged off by the officers of Fannius, he passed\r\nby without helping him, whether it was that he feared to put to the test\r\nhis power which was now on the decline, or that he did not choose, as he\r\nsaid, to give his enemies the opportunity which they were seeking of\r\ncoming to a collision and a struggle. It also chanced that he had\r\nincurred the ill-will of his fellow-colleagues, in the following\r\nmanner:--The people were going to see an exhibition of gladiators in the\r\nForum, and most of the magistrates had constructed seats round the\r\nplace, with the intention of letting them for hire. But Caius urged them\r\nto remove the seats, that the poor might be able to see the show without\r\npaying. As no one took any notice of what he said, he waited till the\r\nnight before the show, when he went with the workmen whom he had under\r\nhim, and removed the seats, and at daybreak he pointed out to the people\r\nthat the place was clear; for which the many considered him a man, but\r\nhe offended his colleagues, who viewed him as an audacious and violent\r\nperson. Owing to this circumstance, it is supposed, he lost his third\r\ntribunate, though he had most votes, for it is said that his colleagues\r\nacted illegally and fraudulently in the proclamation and return. This,\r\nhowever, was disputed. Caius did not bear his failure well: and to his\r\nenemies, who were exulting over him, he is said to have observed, with\r\nmore arrogance than was befitting, that their laugh was a sardonic\r\nlaugh,[107] for they knew not what a darkness his political measures\r\nhad spread all around them.\r\n\r\nXIII. After effecting the election of Opimius to the consulship, the\r\nenemies of Caius began to repeal many of his laws and to disturb the\r\nsettlement of Carthage, for the purpose of irritating Caius, in order\r\nthat he might give them some cause of quarrel, and so be got rid of. He\r\nendured this for some time, but his friends, and especially Fulvius,\r\nbeginning to urge him on, he again attempted to combine his partisans\r\nagainst the consul. On this occasion it is said that his mother also\r\nhelped him, by hiring men from remote parts and sending them to Rome in\r\nthe disguise of reapers, for it is supposed that these matters are\r\nobscurely alluded to in her letters[108] to her son. Others, on the\r\ncontrary, say that this was done quite contrary to the wishes of\r\nCornelia. On the day on which the party of Opimius intended to repeal\r\nthe laws of Caius, the Capitol had been occupied by the opposite faction\r\nearly in the morning. The consul had offered the sacrifices, and one of\r\nhis officers, named Quintus Antyllius,[109] was carrying the viscera to\r\nanother part, when he said to the partisans of Fulvius, \"Make way for\r\nhonest men, you rascals.\" Some say that as he uttered these words he\r\nalso held out his bare arm with insulting gestures. However this may be,\r\nAntyllius was killed on the spot, being pierced with large styles[110]\r\nsaid to have been made expressly for the purpose. The people were\r\ngreatly disturbed at the murder, but it produced exactly opposite\r\neffects on the leaders of the two parties. Caius was deeply grieved at\r\nwhat had happened, and abused his party for having given a handle to\r\ntheir enemies, who had long been looking for it; but Opimius, as if he\r\nhad got the opportunity which he wanted, was highly elated, and urged\r\nthe people to avenge the murder.\r\n\r\nXIV. A torrent of rain happened to fall just then, and the meeting was\r\ndissolved. Early on the following day Opimius summoned the senate to\r\ntransact business. In the mean time the naked body of Antyllius was\r\nplaced on a bier, and, according to arrangement, carried through the\r\nForum past the senate-house with loud cries and lamentations. Opimius,\r\nthough he knew what was going on, pretended to be surprised at the\r\nnoise, and the senators went out to see what was the matter. When the\r\nbier had been set down in the midst of the crowd, the senators began to\r\nexpress their indignation at so horrible and monstrous a crime; but this\r\nonly moved the people to hate and execrate the oligarchs, who, after\r\nmurdering Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol, a tribune, had treated his\r\nbody with insult; while Antyllius, a mere servant, who perhaps had not\r\ndeserved his fate, yet was mainly to blame for what happened, was laid\r\nout in the Forum, and surrounded by the Roman senate lamenting and\r\nassisting at the funeral of a hireling; and all this merely to\r\naccomplish the ruin of the only remaining guardian of the people's\r\nliberties. On returning to the senate-house, the senators passed a\r\ndecree[111] by which the consul Opimius was directed to save the state\r\nin such way as he could, and to put down the tyrants. Opimius gave\r\nnotice to the senators to arm, and each eques was commanded to bring in\r\nthe morning two armed slaves. On the other side, Fulvius also made\r\npreparation and got together a rabble; but Caius as he left the Forum\r\nstood opposite his father's statue, and looking at it for some time\r\nwithout speaking, at last burst into tears, and fetching a deep sigh,\r\nwalked away. The sight of this moved many of the spectators to\r\ncompassion, and blaming themselves for deserting the man and betraying\r\nhim, they came to the house of Caius and passed the night at his door;\r\nbut not in the same manner as those who watched about the house of\r\nFulvius, for they spent the night in tumult and shouting, drinking, and\r\nbragging what they would do. Fulvius himself, who was the first to get\r\ndrunk, spoke and acted in a way quite unseemly for a man of his age. The\r\nfollowers of Caius, viewing the state of affairs as a public calamity,\r\nkept quiet, thinking of the future, and they passed the night watching\r\nand sleeping in turns.\r\n\r\nXV. At daybreak Fulvius was with difficulty roused from his drunken\r\nsleep, and his partisans, arming themselves with the warlike spoils in\r\nhis house, which he had taken in his victory over the Gauls during his\r\nconsulship, with loud threats and shouts went to seize the Aventine\r\nHill.[112] Caius would not arm, but went out in his toga just as if he\r\nwas proceeding to the Forum, with only a short dagger at his side. As he\r\nwas going out at the door, his wife met him, and throwing one arm round\r\nhim, while she held in the other their little child, said, \"Caius, not\r\nas in time past do I take my leave of you going to the Rostra as tribune\r\nand as legislator, nor yet going to a glorious war, where, if you died\r\nin the service of your country, you would still leave me an honoured\r\ngrief; but you are going to expose yourself to the murderers of\r\nTiberius: 'tis right indeed to go unarmed, and to suffer rather than do\r\nwrong, but you will perish without benefiting the state. The worst has\r\nnow prevailed; force and the sword determine all controversies. If your\r\nbrother had died at Numantia, his body would have been restored to us on\r\nthe usual terms of war; but now perchance I too shall have to\r\nsupplicate some river or the sea to render up to me your corpse from its\r\nkeeping. What faith can we put in the laws or in the deities since the\r\nmurder of Tiberius?\" While Licinia was thus giving vent to sorrow,\r\nGracchus gently freed himself from his wife's embrace, and went off in\r\nsilence with his friends. Licinia, as she attempted to lay hold of his\r\ndress, fell down on the floor, and lay there some time speechless, until\r\nher slaves took her up fainting, and carried her to her brother Crassus.\r\n\r\nXVI. When they were all assembled, Fulvius, at the request of Caius,\r\nsent his younger son with a caduceus[113] to the Forum. He was a most\r\nbeautiful youth, and with great decorum and modesty, and with tears in\r\nhis eyes he addressed to the consul and the senate the message of\r\nconciliation. The majority who were present were not disinclined to come\r\nto terms; but Opimius replied, that Fulvius and Gracchus must not\r\nattempt to bring the senate to an accommodation through the medium of a\r\nmessenger; they must consider themselves as citizens who had to account\r\nfor their conduct, and come down and surrender, and then beg for mercy;\r\nhe further told the youth that these were the terms on which he must\r\ncome a second time, or not at all. Now Caius, it is said, wished to go\r\nand clear himself before the senate, but as no one else assented,\r\nFulvius again sent his son to address the senate on their behalf in the\r\nsame terms as before. But Opimius, who was eager to come to blows,\r\nforthwith ordered the youth to be seized and put in prison, and advanced\r\nagainst the party of Fulvius with many legionary soldiers and Cretan\r\nbowmen[114] who mainly contributed to put them into confusion by\r\ndischarging their arrows and wounding them. The partisans of Fulvius\r\nbeing put to flight, he made his escape into a bath that was not used\r\nwhere he was soon discovered and put to death with his elder son. Caius\r\nwas not observed to take any part in the contest, but greatly troubled\r\nat what was taking place, he retired to the temple of Diana, and was\r\ngoing to kill himself there, but was prevented by his faithful friends\r\nPomponius and Licinius, who took the sword away and induced him to fly.\r\nIt is said that he went down on his knees in the temple, and stretching\r\nout his hands to the statue of the goddess, prayed that the Roman\r\npeople, for their ingratitude and treachery to him, might always be\r\nslaves; for the greater part of them had openly gone over to the other\r\nside upon an amnesty[115] being proclaimed.\r\n\r\nXVII. In his flight Caius was followed by his enemies, who were near\r\novertaking him at the wooden bridge,[116] but his two friends, bidding\r\nhim make his escape, opposed the pursuers and allowed no man to pass the\r\nhead of the bridge till they were killed. Caius was accompanied by a\r\nsingle slave, named Philocrates,[117] and though all the spectators\r\nurged him to fly, just as if they were shouting at a race, yet no one,\r\nthough he prayed for it, would come to his aid or lend him a horse: for\r\nthe pursuers were close upon him. He just escaped into a sacred grove of\r\nthe Furies,[118] and there he fell by the hand of Philocrates, who\r\nkilled himself on the body of his master. Some say both of them were\r\ntaken alive by their enemies, and that the slave embraced his master so\r\nclosely, that Caius could not be struck until the slave had been\r\ndispatched first, and with many blows. It is said that a man cut off the\r\nhead of Caius and was carrying it away, but it was taken from him by a\r\nfriend of Opimius named Septimuleius; for proclamation had been made at\r\nthe beginning of the contest, that those who brought the heads of Caius\r\nand Fulvius should have their weight in gold. The head of Caius was\r\nbrought to Opimius by Septimuleius stuck on a spear, and it weighed\r\nseventeen pounds and two-thirds in the scales. Septimuleius was a\r\nscoundrel and a knave[119] here also, for he had taken out the brain and\r\ndropped melted lead in its place. Those who brought the head of Fulvius\r\ngot nothing, for they belonged to the lower class. The bodies of Caius\r\nand Fulvius and their partisans were thrown into the river, the number\r\nof dead being three thousand: their property was sold and the produce\r\npaid into the treasury. They also forbade the women to lament for their\r\nrelatives, and Licinia was deprived of her marriage portion. But their\r\nconduct was most cruel to the younger son of Fulvius, who had neither\r\nraised up his hand against them nor been among the combatants; for he\r\nwas seized before the battle, when he came to treat of terms, and was\r\nput to death after the battle. But what most of all vexed the people was\r\nthe circumstance of Opimius erecting a temple to Concord, which was\r\nviewed as an evidence of his insolence and arrogance, and as a kind of\r\ntriumph for the slaughter of so many citizens. Accordingly by night some\r\nperson wrote under the inscription on the temple the following line:--\r\n\r\n   The work of Discord[120] makes the temple of Concord.\r\n\r\nXVIII. This Opimius,[121] the first man that ever exercised the\r\ndictatorial power in the office of consul, and who had condemned without\r\ntrial three thousand citizens, and among them Caius Gracchus and Fulvius\r\nFlaccus[122]--Flaccus, a consular, who had enjoyed a triumph; Gracchus,\r\nthe first man of his age in character and reputation--this Opimius did\r\nnot keep himself free from corruption. Being sent as a commissioner to\r\nJugurtha, the Numidian, he was bribed by him, and being convicted of\r\nmost shameful corruption, he spent the last years of his life in infamy,\r\nhated and insulted by the people, who, though humbled and depressed for\r\nthe time, soon showed how much they desired and regretted the Gracchi.\r\nFor they had statues of the two brothers made and set up in public\r\nplaces, and the spots on which they fell were declared sacred ground, to\r\nwhich people brought all the first fruits of the seasons, and many\r\npersons daily offered sacrifices there and worshipped, just as at the\r\ntemples of the gods.\r\n\r\nXIX. Cornelia is said to have borne her misfortunes with a noble and\r\nelevated spirit, and to have said of the sacred ground on which her sons\r\nwere murdered, that they had a tomb worthy of them. She resided in the\r\nneighbourhood of Misenum, without making any change in her usual mode of\r\nlife. She had many friends, and her hospitable table was always crowded\r\nwith guests; Greeks and learned men were constantly about her, and kings\r\nsent and received presents from her. To all her visitors and friends she\r\nwas a most agreeable companion: she would tell them of the life and\r\nhabits of her father Africanus, and, what is most surprising, would\r\nspeak of her sons without showing sorrow or shedding a tear, relating\r\ntheir sufferings and their deeds to her inquiring friends as if she was\r\nspeaking of the men of olden time. This made some think that her\r\nunderstanding had been impaired by old age or the greatness of her\r\nsorrows, and that she was dull to all sense of her misfortunes, while in\r\nfact such people themselves were too dull to see what a support it is\r\nagainst grief to have a noble nature, and to be of honourable lineage\r\nand honourably bred; and that though fortune has often the advantage\r\nover virtue in its attempts to guard against evils, yet she cannot take\r\naway from virtue the power of enduring them with fortitude.[123]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF TIBERIUS AND CAIUS GRACCHUS WITH AGIS AND KLEOMENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Now that we have completed the narrative of these men's lives, it\r\nremains for us to compare them with one another. As for the Gracchi, not\r\neven their bitterest enemies could deny that they were the most virtuous\r\nof all the Romans, or that they were excellently well nurtured and\r\neducated; while Agis and Kleomenes appear to have excelled them in\r\nstrength of mind, because they both, after having been brought up in the\r\nsame fashion by which their elders had been corrupted, became the\r\nrestorers of temperance and simplicity of life. Furthermore, the\r\nGracchi, who lived at a period when Rome was at the height of its\r\ngreatness and renown, felt ashamed to fall short of the glorious\r\nachievements of their forefathers; while the virtuous impulses of the\r\nothers were not checked by their fathers having pursued the opposite\r\ncourse of policy, or by the miserable and distracted condition of their\r\ncountry. The greatest proof of the unselfishness and indifference to\r\nmoney of the Gracchi is that they filled various offices in the state,\r\nand yet kept their hands clean from dishonest gains; while it would be\r\nan insult to Agis to praise him for not having taken other men's money,\r\nas he gave up to his countrymen his own private property, which alone\r\nwas worth six hundred talents. If then he thought it discreditable for\r\nhim to be richer than any of his countrymen, even though his riches were\r\nlawfully acquired, what must have been his abhorrence of those who\r\nobtain money wrongfully.\r\n\r\nII. There was also a great difference in the boldness and extent of\r\ntheir schemes of reform. The Gracchi were chiefly engaged in the\r\nconstruction of roads and the founding of cities, and Tiberius's most\r\nimportant measure of reform was the division of the public lands among\r\nthe people, while the best act of his brother Caius was the\r\nestablishment of a mixed tribunal by adding to the three hundred\r\nSenators three hundred Roman Knights. The revolution effected by Agis\r\nand Kleomenes was of quite a different kind. They thought, in Plato's\r\nwords, that to proceed by slow degrees was merely cutting off the heads\r\nof the hydra,[124] and therefore they by one comprehensive measure swept\r\naway all abuses at once: although it would be nearer the truth to say\r\nthat they swept all abuses out of the state by restoring to it its\r\noriginal constitution. It may also be observed that the reforms of the\r\nGracchi were opposed by some of the most powerful men in Rome, whereas\r\nthe legislation which was begun by Agis, and completed by Kleomenes,\r\nfollowed a famous and ancient precedent, the rhetras on sobriety and\r\nequality which had been communicated to their ancestors by Lykurgus with\r\nthe sanction of the Pythian Apollo. It is also most important to notice\r\nthat the reforms of the Gracchi made Rome no greater than she was\r\nbefore, while the acts of Kleomenes enabled him in a short time to make\r\nSparta mistress of the whole of Peloponnesus, and to engage in a contest\r\nwith the most powerful man of his time, with the object of ridding\r\nGreece from Illyrian and Gaulish mercenary troops, and of renewing its\r\nancient glories under the rule of the Herakleidæ.\r\n\r\nIII. I think too that the deaths of these men show a certain difference\r\nin their courage. The Gracchi fought with their countrymen, and were\r\nslain by them while flying, while of the other two, Agis may almost be\r\nsaid to have died voluntarily, because he would not put a citizen to\r\ndeath, while Kleomenes, when insulted and ill-treated, fiercely\r\nattempted to avenge himself, and as circumstances prevented his\r\nsucceeding, bravely killed himself. It may be said on the other side\r\nthat Agis never distinguished himself in the field, and we may set\r\nagainst the many brilliant victories of Kleomenes the scaling of the\r\nwall of Carthage by Tiberius Gracchus, no slight achievement, and the\r\npeace which he made with the Numantines, by which he saved the lives of\r\ntwenty thousand Roman soldiers, who could not otherwise have hoped to\r\nsurvive; while Caius, in several campaigns both in Italy and Sardinia,\r\nshowed great military skill; so that they both might have rivalled the\r\nfame of the greatest generals of Rome, had they not been cut off so\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nIV. In political matters Agis appears to have shown weakness, as he\r\nallowed Agesilaus to cheat the citizens out of their promised\r\nredistribution of lands, and in a feeble and vacillating manner\r\nannounced his intention and then abandoned it. The cause of his\r\nirresolution was his extreme youth; while Kleomenes on the other hand\r\neffected his revolution with too great promptitude and daring, putting\r\nthe Ephors to death without a trial, when it would have been easy for\r\nhim to have won them over to his side, and banishing many of the\r\ncitizens. It is not the part either of a wise physician or of a good\r\npolitician to use the knife except in the last extremity, but it shows a\r\nwant of skill in both, and in the latter case it is unjust as well as\r\ncruel. Of the Gracchi, neither would begin a civil war, and Caius is\r\nsaid not even to have defended himself when struck, but though forward\r\nenough in battle he was loth to fight in a party quarrel; for he\r\nappeared in public unarmed, and retired when fighting began, and\r\nevidently took more pains not to do any harm than not to suffer any. For\r\nthis reason we must regard the flight of both the Gracchi as a proof,\r\nnot of cowardice, but of caution; for they must either have retreated\r\nwhen attacked or have retaliated upon their opponents.\r\n\r\nV. The heaviest charge that can be brought against Tiberius is that he\r\ndeposed his colleague from the tribuneship, and afterwards sought a\r\nsecond tribuneship for himself. As for the murder of Antyllius, Caius\r\nGracchus was most falsely and unjustly accused of it, for he did not\r\nwish him to die, and was grieved at his death. Again Kleomenes, not to\r\nspeak of his massacre of the Ephors, set all the slaves at liberty, and\r\npractically made himself despot of the kingdom, although for form's sake\r\nhe associated his brother with him, who was of the same family. And\r\nwhen Archidamus, who was the next heir to the throne of the other royal\r\nhouse, was persuaded by him to return from Messene to Sparta, as\r\nKleomenes did not avenge his death, he caused men to suspect that he\r\nhimself had some share in it. Yet Lykurgus, whom he affected to imitate,\r\nabdicated the throne of his own free will in favour of his nephew\r\nCharilaus, and fearing that if the child died by any mischance he might\r\nbe thought guilty of having caused its death, he travelled abroad for a\r\nlong time and did not return until Charilaus had begotten a son to\r\nsucceed him. However, no Greek can bear comparison with Lykurgus; yet we\r\nhave proved that Kleomenes effected greater reforms, and showed less\r\nrespect to the laws than any of the others. Both the Greeks have been\r\nblamed for having from the very outset aimed at being nothing more than\r\nwarlike despots; while the worst enemies of the Romans only charge them\r\nwith an immoderate ambition, and admit that they became so excited by\r\nthe contest with their political opponents that the natural heat of\r\ntheir temper drove them in spite of themselves like a baleful gust of\r\nwind to advocate extreme measures. What indeed can be more just or\r\nhonourable than the objects with which they started; for their troubles\r\nwere brought upon them by the opposition which the rich offered to their\r\nlaws, so that the one was forced to fight to save his own life, while\r\nthe other endeavoured to avenge his brother, who was slain without law\r\nor justice? From what has been said the reader can himself form an\r\nopinion about their respective merits, but if I must say what I think of\r\neach, I should give the highest place in respect of virtue to Tiberius\r\nGracchus; I think that the young Agis committed the fewest crimes; while\r\nin daring and action Caius fell far short of Kleomenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF DEMOSTHENES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The writer of the Ode to Alkibiades on the occasion of his winning\r\nthe chariot-race at Olympia, whether he was Euripides, as is commonly\r\nsupposed, or some other poet, my friend Sossius tells us that the first\r\nthing necessary for a perfectly happy man is that he should be born a\r\ncitizen of some famous city. But for my own part I believe that for the\r\nenjoyment of true happiness, which depends chiefly upon a man's\r\ncharacter and disposition, it makes no difference whether he be born in\r\nan obscure state or of an ill-favoured mother, or not. It would indeed\r\nbe absurd if one were to suppose that the town of Iulis, which is only a\r\nsmall part of the little island of Keos or Ægina, which some Athenian\r\nbade his countrymen clear away because it was an eyesore to Peiræus,\r\nshould be able to produce good actors and poets, and yet be unable to\r\nbring forth a just, virtuous, sensible and high-minded man. We may\r\nreasonably expect that those arts by which men gain glory or profit\r\nshould be neglected and fall into decay in small and obscure towns; but\r\nvirtue, like a hardy plant, can take root in any country where it meets\r\nwith noble natures and industrious disposition. I myself therefore must\r\nlay the blame of my intellectual and moral shortcomings, not upon the\r\ninsignificance of my native city, but upon myself.\r\n\r\nII. However, when a man is engaged in compiling a history from materials\r\nwhich are not ready to his hand, but for the most part are to be found\r\nscattered through other foreign towns, it becomes really of the first\r\nimportance that he should live in some famous, cultivated, and populous\r\ncity, where he can have unlimited access to books of all kinds, and\r\nwhere he can also personally collect and inquire into the truth of\r\nthose stories which, though not reduced to writing, are all the more\r\nlikely to be true because they rest upon universal popular tradition.\r\nThe work of a historian who is deprived of these advantages must\r\nnecessarily be defective in many essential particulars. Now I, who\r\nbelong to a small city, and who love to live in it lest it should become\r\neven smaller, when I was at Rome, and during my travels in Italy, found\r\nmy time so taken up with political business and with the care of my\r\npupils in philosophy, that I had no leisure to learn the Roman language,\r\nand have only applied myself to Latin literature at a very advanced\r\nperiod of life. In this reading of Latin books, singular as it may\r\nappear, I did not find that the words assisted me to discover the\r\nmeaning, but rather that my knowledge of the history enabled me to find\r\nout the meaning of the words. I think that to speak the Latin language\r\nwith elegance, to understand it readily, and to use its various idioms\r\nand phrases correctly, is for a literary man both useful and\r\ninteresting; but the amount of study and practice which it requires is\r\nconsiderable and should only be undertaken by those who are younger than\r\nmyself, and who have more leisure time to devote to the acquisition of\r\nsuch accomplishments.\r\n\r\nIII. In consequence of these considerations, in this my fifth book of\r\nParallel Lives, which deals with the lives of Demosthenes and Cicero, I\r\nintend to describe their several characters, and to compare them with\r\none another by means of their political acts, but I do not mean to\r\nexamine minutely into their respective speeches, or to decide which of\r\nthe two was the more pleasing or the more able orator. Were I to attempt\r\nsuch a task, I should be forgetting Ion's proverb about a \"fish out of\r\nwater,\" like the all-accomplished Cæcilius, who has boldly taken upon\r\nhimself to write a comparison of Demosthenes with Cicero. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, we might begin to doubt the divine origin of the commandment\r\n\"know thyself,\" if we found men always ready to apply it. Indeed Heaven\r\nappears to have originally intended to form the characters of\r\nDemosthenes and Cicero on the same model, and in some instances to have\r\nimplanted in them precisely the same qualities, such as great personal\r\nambition, love of freedom, and want of courage in the wars, yet to have\r\nleft much to chance. I think it would be difficult to find an instance\r\nof any two other orators who both rose from a humble station to great\r\npower and influence, who both opposed absolute monarchs, both lost\r\nfavourite daughters, were both exiled and brought back with honour, who\r\nboth when flying from their country a second time fell into the hands of\r\ntheir enemies, and with whose deaths the liberties of their countrymen\r\nwere finally extinguished; so that it is hard to say whether their\r\nresemblance is due more to nature, which originally moulded their\r\ncharacters alike, or to fortune, which placed then in exactly similar\r\ncircumstances. First, then, I will relate the life of the elder of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nIV. The father of Demosthenes was also named Demosthenes, and belonged,\r\naccording to Theopompus, to the best class of Athenian citizens. He was\r\ncommonly called \"the sword cutler,\" because he possessed a large\r\nworkshop and many slaves skilled in cutlery. As for the accusation which\r\nthe orator Æschines brings against his mother, that she was the daughter\r\nof one Gylon, who was banished for treason, by a foreign woman, we\r\ncannot tell whether it is true or only a calumnious imputation.\r\nDemosthenes was left an orphan at the age of seven years, and was the\r\nheir to considerable property, amounting in all to no less than fifteen\r\ntalents. He was scandalously ill-used by his guardians, who appropriated\r\nmuch of his income, and neglected the rest so much that he was unable to\r\npay his teachers. He grew up ignorant of much that a boy of good birth\r\nis expected to learn, partly for this reason, and partly on account of\r\nhis weak health, which caused his mother to keep him away from school.\r\nHe was a sickly child, and it is said that the opprobrious nickname of\r\nBatalus was bestowed upon him by his school-fellows because of his\r\nbodily weakness. Batalus, according to some writers, was an effeminate\r\nflute-player, whose habits were satirized in a comic drama written by\r\nAntiphanes. Others assert that Batalus was a poet who wrote in a drunken\r\nlicentious style; and there seems also some foundation for the belief\r\nthat this word was used for a certain part of the human body by the\r\nAthenians of that time. The other nickname of Demosthenes, Argas,\r\neither alludes to his savage and harsh temper, for some poets use the\r\nword to mean a snake; or else it refers to his speeches, as wearying\r\nthose who heard them; for Argas was the name of a poet whose verses were\r\nbad and tiresome. And, as Plato says, so much for this.\r\n\r\nV. We are told that he was first led to turn his attention, to oratory\r\nby the following incident. When Kallistratus was going to make a speech\r\nin court about the affair of Oropus[125] great interest was taken in the\r\ntrial because of the ability of the orator, who at that time was at the\r\nheight of his reputation, and also because of the important character of\r\nthe law suit. Demosthenes, hearing his teachers and attendants making\r\narrangement to be present at the trial, persuaded his own servant by\r\ngreat entreaties to take him to hear the speeches. The man, who was\r\nintimate with the doorkeepers of the court, managed to obtain a place\r\nfor Demosthenes, in which the boy could sit unseen by the public and\r\nhear all that was said. Kallisthenes spoke very brilliantly and was much\r\nadmired. He excited the envy of Demosthenes by the honours which he\r\nreceived, as he was escorted home by a long train of friends who\r\ncongratulated him upon his success; but the boy was even more impressed\r\nby the power of his eloquence, which enabled him to deal with everything\r\njust as he pleased. In consequence of this Demosthenes neglected all\r\nother branches of learning, neglected all the sports of childhood, and\r\nlaboriously practised and exercised himself in the art of oratory,\r\nmeaning some day to become an orator himself. He studied rhetoric under\r\nIsaeus, although Isokrates was giving lessons at the same time, either,\r\naccording to some writers, because, being an orphan, he was unable to\r\nraise the sum of ten minæ which Isokrates demanded as a fee, or because\r\nhe thought that the vigorous invective of Isaeus was more what he\r\nrequired to learn. Hermippus informs us that he read in some anonymous\r\nwork that Demosthenes was a scholar of Plato, and learned much of the\r\nart of speaking from him, while he mentions having heard from Ktesibius\r\nthat Demosthenes had been lent the works of Isokrates and Alkidamas by\r\none Kallias, a Syracusan, and some others, and that he used to read and\r\npractise himself in them in secret.\r\n\r\nVI. When he came of age he at once brought a series of actions against\r\nhis guardians for malversation of his property, while they resorted to\r\nevery species of legal subtlety and chicanery to avoid making\r\nrestitution. By publicly pleading his cause, as Thucydides says, \"he\r\nlearned his trade by dangers,\" and succeeded in recovering some of his\r\npaternal estate, though but a small part of that to which he was\r\nentitled. He gained, however, confidence and practice as a public\r\nspeaker, and the fascinating excitement and sense of power which he\r\nexperienced in these contests emboldened him to become a professional\r\norator and to deal with political matters. We are told that Laomedon of\r\nOrchomenus, by the advice of his physicians, used to run long distances\r\nas a remedy for a disease of the spleen from which he suffered, until he\r\nnot only overcame his disorder, but was able to enter for races at the\r\ngames, and became one of the best long-distance runners of his time.\r\nEven so Demosthenes, who was forced by his private misfortunes to make\r\nhis first appearance as a speaker, gained such skill and power by his\r\nsuccess in the law-courts that he soon took the lead among the speakers\r\nin the public assembly. Yet when he first addressed the people he was\r\nviolently coughed down, interrupted and ridiculed, because his speech\r\nwas found dull and tiresome, being confused in style and strained and\r\nartificial in argument. It is said that his voice was weak, and his\r\npronunciation indistinct, and that, as he was frequently obliged to\r\npause for want of breath, it was difficult to follow the meaning of his\r\nsentences. At last he left the public assembly and wandered about\r\nPeiræus in despair. Here he was met by an old man named Eunomus of\r\nThriasia,[126] who reproved him and told him that he did himself great\r\nwrong, because, having a manner of speech extremely like that of\r\nPerikles, he permitted himself to be disheartened by failure, and did\r\nnot face the clamour of the rabble boldly, and did not train his body to\r\nbe strong enough to support the strain of such contests, but allowed\r\nhimself to fall into a weakly and effeminate condition.\r\n\r\nVII. After a second failure, as he was going home overwhelmed with shame\r\nhiding his face in his cloak, Satyrus the actor is said to have followed\r\nhim and joined him. Demosthenes told him with tears in his eyes that\r\nalthough he had taken more pains than any other speaker, and had devoted\r\nall his energes to the study of eloquence, yet he could not gain the ear\r\nof the people, but that ignorant drunken sailors were listened to when\r\nthey mounted the tribune, while he was treated with scorn. On hearing\r\nthis Satyrus answered, \"Demosthenes, what you say is very true, but I\r\nwill soon apply a remedy, if you will recite to me one of the long\r\nspeeches from the plays of Sophokles or Euripides.\" After Demosthenes\r\nhad recited a speech, Satyrus recited the same speech in turn, and so\r\naltered it and gave it so much more grace, by throwing into it the\r\nexpression which the verses required, that it appeared to Demosthenes to\r\nbe quite different. Having thus learned how much a speech gains by a\r\nreally artistic delivery, Demosthenes perceived that it was of but\r\nlittle use for him to study the matter of a speech, unless he also paid\r\nattention to the form in which it was to be presented to his audience.\r\nHe now built for himself an underground study, which remained entire\r\ndown to the present day, where he daily practised himself in gesture and\r\ndeclamation, and exercised his voice, and where he sometimes spent two\r\nor three months at a time with half of his head shaved, so that even if\r\nhe wished he could not go out of doors.\r\n\r\nVIII. He took, however, his themes and subjects for declamation from the\r\nvarious topics of the day, which he learned from those who came to visit\r\nhim. As soon as they left him he used to return to his study, and\r\nrepeated aloud in the form of a speech all the news which he had heard,\r\nand made comments upon it. He also used to work up any conversations\r\nwhich he heard, into sentences and periods for his orations, and would\r\nalter, correct and paraphrase both his own remarks and those of his\r\nfriends. This gave rise to the opinion that he was not really a man of\r\nability, but that his power and skill as an orator was obtained by\r\nlaborious study. A great proof of this was thought to be that\r\nDemosthenes seldom spoke on the spur of the moment, but often when he\r\nwas present in the assembly and was called upon by the people to speak,\r\nhe would remain silent unless he had prepared and meditated over his\r\nspeech. Many of the other orators ridiculed him for this, and Pytheas in\r\nderision said that his arguments smelt of the lamp. To this Demosthenes\r\nmade the bitter retort, \"My lamp, Pytheas, sees very different work from\r\nyours.\" In conversation with others, however, he did not altogether deny\r\nthe practice, but said that although he never spoke without having made\r\nnotes, yet that he often spoke without having written down everything\r\nthat he was going to say. He used to say that this careful preparation\r\nof his speeches showed that he was a true lover of the people, and felt\r\na due reverence for them; while, on the contrary, to speak without\r\ncaring how the people take one's words proves a man to be of an\r\noverbearing oligarchical disposition, who would use force rather than\r\npersuasion. Many writers allege, as a proof that Demosthenes dared not\r\nspeak on the spur of the moment, that when he attacked Demades he was\r\nalways immediately answered by him, but that he never so answered\r\nDemades.\r\n\r\nIX. How then, one might ask, was it that Æschines in his orations speaks\r\nof Demosthenes as a man of unbounded impudence? or how was it that when\r\nPython of Byzantium was pouring forth a flood of invective against\r\nAthens, Demosthenes alone rose and answered him? Moreover, when Lamachus\r\nof Mytilene, who had written an encomium upon the Kings of Macedon,\r\nPhilip and Alexander, which was full of abuse of the Thebans and\r\nOlynthians, read his composition in public at the Olympic festival,\r\nDemosthenes came up to him and in a fine speech proved from history how\r\ngreat things the Thebans and inhabitants of Chalkidike had done for\r\nGreece, and what evils had arisen from the baseness of those who\r\nflattered the Macedonians, till the audience were so much wrought upon\r\nby his eloquence that Lamachus was forced to flee for his life. The\r\nanswer to this appears to be that Demosthenes, although he did not copy\r\nPerikles in all respects, imitated his reserve and dignity of manner,\r\nand his reluctance to speak upon every trivial occasion; and that he was\r\nnot so much attracted by the credit which he might gain by engaging in\r\nthese encounters, as he was unwilling rashly to place his power and\r\nreputation at the mercy of fortune. Indeed, his spoken orations had more\r\nfire and daring than the written ones, if we may trust Eratosthenes,\r\nDemetrius of Phalerum, and the comic poets. Eratosthenes tells us that\r\nin his speeches he used to rave like a Bacchanal, while Demetrius says\r\nthat once, as if inspired, he recited the metrical oath:\r\n\r\n   \"By earth, by fountains, and by waterfloods.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the comic poets also calls him \"the random talker,\" while another\r\nmocks at his fondness for antithesis in the following verses:\r\n\r\n   \"_1st Citizen._ He got it as he got it back.\r\n\r\n   _2nd Citizen._ Demosthenes would willingly have spoken words like\r\n   these.\"\r\n\r\nUnless indeed Antiphanes meant by this to allude to the oration on\r\nHalonesus, in which Demosthenes advised the Athenians not to take that\r\nisland, but to take it back from Philip.\r\n\r\nX. Yet all admitted that Demades, by his own natural wit, without art,\r\nwas invincible; and that he often, speaking on the spur of the moment,\r\nwould demolish the carefully studied orations of Demosthenes. Ariston of\r\nChios has preserved the opinion of Theophrastus about these two orators.\r\nTheophrastus, when asked what kind of orator he thought Demosthenes to\r\nbe, replied, \"an orator worthy of Athens.\" When again asked his opinion\r\nof Demades, he replied that he thought him \"Too great for Athens.\" The\r\nsame philosopher relates that Polyeuktus of Sphettus, one of the chief\r\nAthenian statesmen of the time, used to declare that Demosthenes was the\r\nbest orator, but that Phokion was the most powerful speaker, because his\r\nspeeches contained the greatest possible amount of meaning in the fewest\r\nwords. Demosthenes himself, whenever Phokion rose to answer him, was\r\nwont to whisper to his friends, \"Here comes the cleaver of my\r\nharangues.\" It is not clear whether by this Demosthenes alluded to\r\nPhokion's oratorical skill, or to his blameless life and high\r\nreputation, meaning that the slightest sign given by a man in whom the\r\npeople felt such confidence carried more weight than the longest oration\r\nby anyone else.\r\n\r\nXI. Demetrius of Phalerum has recorded the devices by which Demosthenes\r\novercame his bodily defects, which he says he heard from Demosthenes's\r\nown lips when he was an old man. He corrected the indistinctness of his\r\narticulation and his tendency to lisp by declaiming long speeches with\r\npebbles in his mouth, while he strengthened his voice by running or\r\nwalking up hill, talking the while, and repeating orations or verses. He\r\nalso had a large mirror in his house, and used to stand before it and\r\nstudy oratorical gestures. We are told that once a man called upon him\r\nand asked him to act as his counsel in a lawsuit against a man by whom\r\nhe had been beaten. \"But,\" said Demosthenes, \"you have not suffered any\r\nof this ill-treatment which you complain of.\" At this the man raised his\r\nvoice and excitedly exclaimed, \"Do you say, Demosthenes, that I have not\r\nbeen ill-treated?\" \"Yes,\" answered he, \"now I hear the voice of one who\r\nhas really been ill-used.\" So important did he think the action and the\r\ntone of voice of a speaker to be in carrying conviction to the minds of\r\nhis hearers. His manner in speaking marvellously pleased the common\r\npeople, though men of taste, such as Demetrius of Phalerum, thought it\r\nvulgar and affected. Hermippus informs us that Æsion,[127] when asked\r\nto give his opinion about the orators of former times and those of his\r\nown day, said that the ancient orators used to address the people in a\r\nsurprisingly decorous and dignified manner, but that the speeches of\r\nDemosthenes when read aloud, appeared to him to be much more carefully\r\nconstructed and more forcible. It is indeed unnecessary to say that the\r\nwritten speeches of Demosthenes are bitter and angry compositions; but\r\nin his impromptu repartees, he often was genuinely witty and pleasant.\r\nAs for example, when Demades exclaimed, \"Demosthenes teach me! Will a\r\nsow teach Athena?\" Demosthenes answered, \"This Athena was caught in\r\nadultery in Kollytus[128] the other day.\" And when the thief who was\r\nsurnamed Chalkus, that is, Brazen-face, attempted to sneer at him for\r\nsitting up late at night writing, Demosthenes answered, \"I know that my\r\nhabit of burning a lamp at night must disconcert you. But, men of\r\nAthens, need we wonder at the thefts which take place, when we see that\r\nour thieves are brazen, and our walls are only made of clay.\" However,\r\nalthough I could relate several more anecdotes of this kind, I must now\r\nstop, as we ought to discover what remains of the disposition and\r\ncharacter of Demosthenes from a survey of his political acts.\r\n\r\nXII. He first began to take an active part in public affairs during the\r\nPhokian war, as we learn from his own words, and as we may also gather\r\nfrom his Philippic orations, some of which were pronounced after that\r\nwar was ended, while the earlier ones touch on those matters most nearly\r\nconnected with it. It is evident that when he prepared the oration\r\nagainst Meidias he was thirty-two years of age, and had not as yet\r\nacquired any fame or reputation. This appears to me to be the chief\r\nreason for his having made up his quarrel with Meidias for a sum of\r\nmoney, for he was far from being a \"mild-mannered\" man, but keen and\r\nsavage in avenging the injuries which he received. It must have been\r\nbecause he saw, that to ruin a man who was so rich, so able a speaker,\r\nand so well-befriended as Meidias, was too difficult a task for a man of\r\nhis political power, and so yielded to the entreaties of those who\r\nbegged him to let the action drop; for I do not believe that the bribe\r\nof three thousand drachmae which he received would by itself have caused\r\nDemosthenes to lay aside the rancorous hatred which he bore to Meidias,\r\nif he had entertained any hopes of obtaining a verdict against him.\r\n\r\nIn the defence of the liberties of Greece against the encroachments of\r\nPhilip, Demosthenes found a noble theme for political oratory, which he\r\ntreated in a manner worthy of the subject, and soon acquired such renown\r\nby his able and fearless speeches, that he was courted by the king of\r\nPersia himself, and was more talked about in the court of Philip than\r\nany of the other statesmen of the time, while even his bitterest\r\nantagonists admitted that they had to deal with no mean adversary; for\r\nboth Æschines and Hypereides own as much in their invectives against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nXIII. I cannot, therefore, understand what Theopompus meant by saying\r\nthat he was of an inconstant disposition, and not able to remain long\r\nassociated with any party or any line of policy. It appears rather that\r\nhe remained throughout the consistent advocate of the same principles,\r\nand a member of the same political party to which he originally\r\nbelonged, and that he not only never changed his politics in his life,\r\nbut even lost his life because he would not change them. He was not like\r\nDemades, who to excuse himself for changing sides pleaded that he had\r\noftentimes gone against his own words, but never against the interests\r\nof the state. Still less can he be compared with Melanopus, the\r\npolitical opponent of Kallistratus, who was often bribed by him to allow\r\nsome measure to pass, and on these occasions would say to the people,\r\n\"The man is my personal enemy, but I postpone my personal feelings to\r\nthe good of my country.\" Nikodemus of Messene, who first took up with\r\nKassander, and afterwards became the advocate of Demetrius, used to\r\ndeclare that he never was inconsistent, because it was always best to\r\nobey the strongest party. But in the case of Demosthenes, unlike these\r\nmen, we can say that he never deviated either in word or deed from the\r\none direct line of policy which he unswervingly pursued to the end. The\r\nphilosopher Panætius declares that in most of his orations, as in that\r\nabout the Crown, that against Aristokrates, that on behalf of the\r\npersons exempted from taxation (against Leptines), and in the\r\nPhilippics, we can trace the principle that honour ought to be pursued\r\nfor its own sake; for in all these he urges his countrymen not to adopt\r\nthe most pleasant, the most easy, or the most profitable line of policy,\r\nbut often thinks that caution and even safety should be regarded as of\r\nless importance than honourable conduct; so that if to his noble\r\nprinciples and high-minded eloquence he had joined warlike courage and\r\nclean hands from bribery, he would have been worthy to rank, not with\r\nMoerokles, Polyeuktus, and Hypereides, but with Kimon, Thucydides,\r\nPerikles, and other great men of old.\r\n\r\nXIV. Indeed, of his contemporaries, Phokion, although we cannot approve\r\nof the strong Macedonian bias of his policy, was nowise inferior to\r\nEphialtes, Aristeides, or Kimon, either in courage or in just dealing;\r\nwhile Demosthenes, who could not be trusted, as we are told by\r\nDemetrius, to stand his ground in battle, and who was not altogether\r\nproof against the seductions of money--for though he never would receive\r\na bribe from Philip or from Macedonia, yet he was overwhelmed by the\r\ntorrent of gold which poured from Susa and Ekbatana--was better able than\r\nany one else to praise the great deeds of his ancestors, but was not\r\nequally capable of imitating them. Yet in spite of these shortcomings,\r\nhis life was more virtuous than that of any statesman of his time, with\r\nthe exception of Phokion. He used plainer language to the people than\r\nany one else, opposed their wishes, and sharply reproved them for their\r\nmistakes, as we learn from his orations. Theopompus has recorded that\r\nonce when the Athenians called upon him to impeach some person, and\r\nbecame riotous when he refused, he rose and said, \"Men of Athens, I will\r\nalways give you my advice, whether you bid me or not; but I will not\r\naccuse men falsely because you bid me.\" His mode of dealing with\r\nAntiphon also was by no means like that of a man who courts the favour\r\nof the people, for when the public assembly acquitted Antiphon,\r\nDemosthenes dragged him before the court of the Areopagus, and in\r\ndefiance of the expressed opinion of the people, proved him guilty of\r\nhaving promised Philip that he would set fire to the dockyard. The\r\nwretched man was condemned by the court and executed. He also impeached\r\nthe priestess Theoris for various evil practices, and especially for\r\nteaching slaves to cheat their masters. He obtained a verdict against\r\nher, and caused her also to be put to death.\r\n\r\nXV. It is stated that the speech by which Apollodorus obtained sentence\r\nagainst the general Timotheus, and had him condemned to pay a large\r\nfine, was written for him by Demosthenes: and he also wrote the\r\nspeeches against Phormio and Stephanus, which, as may be supposed,\r\nbrought great disgrace upon him. For Phormio actually used a speech\r\nwritten by Demosthenes to combat Apollodorus, which was just as if out\r\nof one armourer's shop he had sold them each daggers to kill one another\r\nwith. Of his public speeches, those against Androtion, Timokrates and\r\nAristokrates were written for other persons, as he had not at the time\r\nof their composition began to speak in public, being only twenty-seven\r\nor twenty-eight years of age. The oration against Aristogeiton, he\r\nhimself pronounced, as he did also that against Leptines, out of regard\r\nfor Ktesippus the son of Chabrias, according to his own account of the\r\nmatter, though some say that he was paying his addresses to the young\r\nman's mother at the time. He did not, however, marry her, but married a\r\nSamian woman, as we learn from the treatise of Demetrius of Magnesia on\r\nSynonyms. It is not clear whether the oration against Æschines for the\r\ndishonest embassage was ever spoken; although we are told by Idomeneus\r\nthat Æschines was only acquitted by thirty votes. This, however, cannot\r\nbe true, judging from the speeches of Demosthenes and Æschines \"on the\r\nCrown:\" for neither of them distinctly alludes to that affair as having\r\never come into court. This point, therefore, I shall leave for others to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nXVI. Before the war broke out no one could doubt which side Demosthenes\r\nwould take, as he never allowed any act of the King of Macedonia to pass\r\nunnoticed, but seized every opportunity of rousing and exciting his\r\ncountrymen to oppose him. In consequence of this his name became well\r\nknown at the court of Philip, and when he was sent with nine others to\r\nMacedonia on an embassy, Philip listened to the speeches of them all,\r\nbut replied to his speech with the greatest care. He did not, however,\r\npay so much attention to Demosthenes in the entertainment which he\r\nprovided for the ambassadors, but took especial pains to win the favour\r\nof Æschines and Philokrates. Hence, when these men praised Philip as\r\nbeing more eloquent, more handsome, and to crown all, able to drink more\r\nthan any one else, Demosthenes sneeringly replied that the first of\r\nthese qualities was excellent in a sophist, the second in a woman, and\r\nthe third in a sponge, but that they were none of them such as became a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nXVII. When war finally broke out, as Philip was unable to remain quiet,\r\nwhile the Athenians were urged on by Demosthenes, his first measure was\r\nto prevail upon the Athenians to recover Euboea, which had been handed\r\nover to Philip by its local rulers. In pursuance of a decree which bore\r\nthe name of Demosthenes, the Athenians crossed into the island and drove\r\nout the Macedonians. Next, as Philip was besieging Byzantium and\r\nPerinthus, Demosthenes prevailed upon his countrymen to lay aside their\r\nanger and forget the wrongs which they had received from the people of\r\nthose cities in the social war, and to send them a reinforcement by\r\nwhich they were saved. After this he travelled through Greece, exciting\r\na spirit of resistance to Philip by his speeches, until he succeeded in\r\nforming nearly all the Greek cities into a confederacy against Philip,\r\norganised an army of fifteen thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry,\r\nbesides the local forces of each city, and induced them to subscribe\r\ncheerfully for the maintenance of the mercenaries and the expenses of\r\nthe war. At this time, we are told by Theophrastus that, when the allies\r\ndemanded that their contributions should be limited to some fixed sum,\r\nKrobylus the Athenian orator answered that war feeds not by a fixed\r\nallowance.[129] Greece was now in a flutter of expectation, and the\r\npeople of Euboea, Achaia, Corinth, Megara, Leukas and Korkyra were all in\r\narms. Yet the hardest task of all still remained for Demosthenes to\r\naccomplish, namely, to induce the Thebans to join the alliance, because\r\ntheir territory bordered upon that of Athens, and their army was very\r\nimportant, for at that time Thebes was the most warlike state in Greece.\r\nIt was no easy matter to win over the Thebans, who had just received\r\nsignal assistance from Philip in their war against the Phokians, and so\r\nwere inclined to take his side, besides which, their being such near\r\nneighbours to the Athenians caused perpetual jealousies and quarrels\r\nbetween the two countries, which were renewed upon the most trifling\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Yet when Philip, excited by his success at Amphissa, suddenly\r\nmarched to Elatea and made himself master of Phokis, when all the\r\nAthenians were panic-stricken, and no one dared to ascend the bema, or\r\nknew what to say, Demosthenes alone came forward and advised them to\r\nstand by the Thebans; and after having, after his wont, encouraged and\r\ncomforted the people, he was sent with some others as ambassador to\r\nThebes. We learn from the historian Marsyas that Philip, too, sent the\r\nMacedonians Amyntas and Klearchus, the Thessalian Daochus, and\r\nThrasydaeus to Thebes to argue on his behalf. The Thebans on this\r\noccasion saw clearly enough on which side their interests lay, for the\r\nsufferings they had just endured in the Phokian war were still fresh in\r\ntheir memories; but we read in the history of Theopompus that the\r\neloquence of Demosthenes so roused and inflamed their courage that all\r\ncold-blooded calculation of the chances, fear of the enemy, and\r\nconsiderations of expediency were entirely lost sight of in the\r\nhonourable enthusiasm created by his speech. So powerful did his oratory\r\nprove, that Philip at once sent an embassy to ask for terms of peace,\r\nwhile Greece stood erect and watchful. Not only the Athenian generals,\r\nbut even the Boeotarchs took their orders from Demosthenes, and he was\r\nas powerful in the public assembly of the Thebans as in that of Athens,\r\nbeing beloved by both nations and possessed of a power which was not\r\nbeyond his deserts, as Theopompus says, but which he well deserved.\r\n\r\nXIX. But some fatal destiny seemed now to have brought round the hour\r\nfor the extinction of the liberties of Greece, and both counteracted his\r\nefforts, and also gave many ominous indications of what was to come. The\r\nPythia at Delphi uttered terrible predictions, and an old oracle of the\r\nSibyls was in every one's mouth, which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Far from the battle, on that fatal day\r\n    Beside Thermodon may I flee away,\r\n    Or view it as an eagle from the sky;\r\n    There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Thermodon is a little rivulet near my own town of\r\nChæronea which runs into the Kephisus. We Chæroneans nowadays do not\r\nknow of any rivulet which is so called, but we suppose that the stream\r\nwhich we call Hæmon was at that period called the Thermodon; for it runs\r\npast the temple of Herakles, where the Greek army encamped: and we\r\nimagine that when the battle took place this stream was filled with\r\nblood and corpses, and became known by its present name. Yet the\r\nhistorian Douris writes that the Thermodon was not a river at all, but\r\nthat some men while digging a trench round their tent found a small\r\nstone image, with an inscription saying that it represented a man named\r\nThermodon carrying a wounded Amazon in his arms. Concerning this there\r\nwas another oracle current, as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Watch for Thermodon's field, thou sable crow,\r\n    There shalt thou feed on human flesh enow.\"\r\n\r\nXX. It is hard in these matters to determine the exact truth: but, be\r\nthis as it may, Demosthenes was greatly encouraged to see such a force\r\nof armed Greeks at his disposal, and, elated by their confidence and\r\neagerness for battle would not allow them to pay any attention to\r\noracles and predictions, but hinted that the Pythia was in Philip's pay,\r\nand reminded the Thebans of Epameinondas, and the Athenians of Perikles,\r\nboth of whom regarded such considerations as mere pretexts for\r\ncowardice. Up to this point he behaved as a brave man should; but in the\r\nbattle[130] itself he performed no honourable exploit worthy of his\r\nspeeches, but left his place in the ranks and ran away in a most\r\nshameful manner, throwing away his arms that he might run faster, and\r\nnot hesitating to disgrace the motto of \"Good Luck,\" which Pytheas tells\r\nus was written in golden letters upon his shield. Immediately after the\r\nvictory Philip, in insolent delight at his success, danced in a drunken\r\nrevel among the corpses and sang the opening words of a decree of\r\nDemosthenes, which happened to form an iambic verse, as follows:--\r\n\r\n   \"Demosthenes Pæanian, son of Demosthenes,\" &c.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, he came to himself, and comprehended how great his danger\r\nhad been, he trembled at the ability and power of an orator who had been\r\nable to force him in a few hours of one day to risk both his empire and\r\nhis life. The fame of Demosthenes reached even to the King of Persia,\r\nand he sent letters to the Satraps who governed the provinces near the\r\nsea, bidding them offer money to Demosthenes, and pay him more attention\r\nthan any other Greek, because he was able to effect a diversion in\r\nfavour of Persia by keeping the King of Macedonia's hands full. This was\r\nafterwards discovered by Alexander, who found at Sardis letters from\r\nDemosthenes and papers belonging to the King's lieutenant, containing an\r\naccount of the various sums of money which they had transmitted to him.\r\n\r\nXXI. When this great misfortune befell Greece, the political opponents\r\nof Demosthenes at once impeached him for his conduct; but the people not\r\nonly acquitted him of the charges which they brought against him, but\r\ncontinued to treat him with great honour, and to ask for his advice.\r\nWhen the remains of those who had fallen at Chæronea were brought home\r\nand buried, they chose him to make the funeral oration over them, and\r\ngenerally they bore their misfortunes with a noble spirit, not being\r\nexcessively humbled and cast down, as Theopompus relates in his history,\r\nwith a view to dramatic effect, but by showing especial honour and\r\nesteem for their principal adviser they proved that they did not repent\r\nof the policy which they had followed. Demosthenes pronounced the\r\nfuneral oration over the fallen, but he never again proposed a decree in\r\nthe popular assembly in his own name, but always in that of some one of\r\nhis friends, in order to avoid the evil omen of his own unlucky name,\r\nuntil he again took courage at the death of Philip, which took place\r\nshortly after his victory at Chæronea. This, it seems, was the meaning\r\nof the last verse of the oracle,\r\n\r\n   \"There shall the vanquished weep, the victor die.\"\r\n\r\nXXII. Demosthenes had secret intelligence of Philip's death, before it\r\nwas publicly known. In order to inspirit the Athenians, he went with a\r\ncheerful countenance into the senate, and declared that he had dreamed\r\nthat some great good fortune was in store for them. Not long afterwards\r\nmessengers arrived with the news of Philip's death. Upon this the\r\nAthenians made sacrifices of thanksgiving to the gods, and decreed a\r\ncrown to Pausanias who slew Philip. Demosthenes also came abroad in a\r\ngay dress, and wearing a garland of flowers on his head, although his\r\ndaughter had only been dead seven days. This circumstance is reported by\r\nÆschines, who reviles him for his conduct, and calls him an unnatural\r\nfather, though he only proves the weakness and vulgarity of his own\r\nnature by supposing that noisy demonstrations of grief show tenderness\r\nof heart, and blaming those who bear their sorrows with dignity and\r\ncomposure. Yet I will not say that the Athenians did right to wear\r\ngarlands and make merry at the death of a king who, after his victory,\r\nhad dealt so gently with them when they were at his mercy; for it\r\ndeserved the anger of the gods, and was a thoroughly low-minded act to\r\nhonour a man while he lived and elect him a citizen of Athens, and then\r\nwhen he fell by the hand of a stranger not to be able to contain\r\nthemselves for joy, but to dance over his corpse and to sing pæans of\r\nvictory, as if they themselves had done some great feat of arms. On the\r\nother hand, I praise Demosthenes for leaving his own home troubles to be\r\nwept for by the women of his household, and himself coming forward and\r\ndoing what he imagined was best for his country. This shows a manly and\r\npatriotic spirit, which ever looks to the good of the community at\r\nlarge; and I think that in forcing his private grief to give way to the\r\npublic joy he acted well, and even outdid those actors who represent\r\nkings and autocrats on the stage, and who laugh or wail not as their own\r\nfeelings bid them, but as the argument of the play requires. Apart from\r\nthese considerations, it is our duty not to forsake a man when he is in\r\nsorrow, but to administer consolation to him and to turn his thoughts to\r\npleasanter subjects, as physicians bid weak-eyed patients turn their\r\neyes away from a distressing glare of light and direct them to green and\r\nsoothing colours; and what better means of consolation could one\r\npossibly find when one's country is fortunate, than to bid one's friend\r\nmerge his private grief in the public joy? I have been led to make\r\nthese reflections by observing that this speech of Æschines has had\r\nundue influence with many persons, because it makes a mistaken appeal to\r\ntheir tenderer feelings.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Now Demosthenes a second time began to rouse the states of Greece\r\nand reorganise the confederacy. The Thebans attacked their Macedonian\r\ngarrison, and killed many of them, with arms furnished by Demosthenes,\r\nand the Athenians began to prepare to fight as their allies. Demosthenes\r\nreigned supreme in the popular assembly, and wrote to the Persian\r\ngenerals in Asia endeavouring to induce them to attack Alexander, whom\r\nhe scoffed at as a child, and nicknamed Margites.[131] But when\r\nAlexander, after settling the affairs of his kingdom, marched with his\r\narmy into Boeotia, the courage of the Athenians deserted them.\r\nDemosthenes himself quailed in terror, and the Thebans, forsaken by\r\ntheir allies, fought against Alexander alone, and were utterly ruined.\r\nUpon this the Athenians, in an agony of terror, sent Demosthenes and\r\nseveral other orators on an embassy to Alexander; but he, fearing\r\nAlexander's fury, went no further than Mount Kithæron, and then returned\r\nhome. Alexander now at once sent to Athens to demand that ten of her\r\nchief orators should be given up to him, according to the historians\r\nIdomeneus and Douris, though most of the more trustworthy writers say\r\nthat he only asked for the eight following:--Demosthenes, Polyeuktus,\r\nEphialtes, Lykurgus, Moerokles, Demon, Kallisthenes and Charidemus. On\r\nthis occasion Demosthenes told the people the fable of the sheep who\r\ngave up their watch-dogs to the wolves, explaining that he and the other\r\norators were the watch-dogs who guarded the people, and calling\r\nAlexander the \"great wolf of Macedon.\" \"Moreover,\" said he, \"by\r\ndelivering us up you really deliver up yourselves also, just as you see\r\nmerchants selling whole cargoes of corn by small samples of a few grains\r\nwhich they carry about in a cup.\" This we learn from Aristobulus of\r\nKassandrea.[132] As the Athenians were quite at their wit's end, and\r\nknew not what to do, Demades at last agreed with the orators whose\r\nextradition was demanded, that in consideration of a sum of five talents\r\nhe would himself go to the king of Macedonia and intercede for them,\r\neither because he trusted in the friendship which existed between him\r\nand Alexander, or because he thought that he should find him like a lion\r\nthat has been satiated with slaughter. Demades succeeded in saving their\r\nlives, and arranged terms of peace between the Athenians and Alexander.\r\n\r\nXXIV. After Alexander's departure Demades and his party were all\r\npowerful at Athens, and Demosthenes was completely humbled. He made an\r\neffort to assist the abortive attempts of Agis[133] King of Sparta, but\r\nas the Athenians would not take part in the proposed rising, and the\r\nLacedæmonians were crushed, he again retired into obscurity. At this\r\ntime also the action bought by Æschines against Ktesiphon about the\r\nCrown came on for trial. This action had been formally begun during the\r\narchonship of Chærondas, a short time before the battle of Chæronea, but\r\nit was not decided until ten years later, in the archonship of\r\nAristophon. This, although a private action, attracted greater interest\r\nthan any public one, both on account of the eloquence of the speakers on\r\nboth sides and the spirited behaviour of the judges, who refused to\r\ntruckle to the party in power, which had banished Demosthenes and which\r\nwas slavishly subservient to Macedonia, but acquitted Demosthenes by\r\nsuch a splendid majority that Æschines did not obtain the fifth part of\r\nthe votes. He in consequence at once left the city, and spent the\r\nremainder of his life at Rhodes and the other cities of the Ionian coast\r\nas a sophist and teacher of rhetoric.\r\n\r\nXXV. Shortly after this, Harpalus arrived in Athens from Asia, fleeing\r\nfrom Alexander, whom he feared to meet, both because he had grossly\r\nmisconducted himself while in command of a province, and because\r\nAlexander had now become a capricious tyrant, terrible even to his\r\nfriends. When he sought refuge with the Athenians, and placed himself,\r\nhis ships, and his treasure in their hands, the other orators, casting\r\nlonging glances at his wealth, at once pleaded for him, and advised the\r\nAthenians to receive and protect the suppliant. Demosthenes at first\r\nadvised them to send Harpalus away, and take care not to involve the\r\ncity in war by such unjust and uncalled-for proceedings: but a few days\r\nafterwards when an inventory was being taken of Harpalus's property, he,\r\nseeing that Demosthenes was admiring a golden Persian drinking cup and\r\nexamining the sculptures with which it was enriched, bade him take it in\r\nhis hands and observe the weight of the gold. Demosthenes was surprised\r\nat the weight, and asked how much it would fetch. Harpalus answered with\r\na smile, \"It will fetch you twenty talents:\" and as soon as it was dark\r\nhe sent the cup and the twenty talents to the house of Demosthenes.\r\nHarpalus had very cleverly fathomed the character of Demosthenes by\r\nobserving the loving and eager glances with which he eyed this cup; for\r\nhe received the bribe and went over to the side of Harpalus, just as if\r\nhe were a city which had received a foreign garrison. Next morning he\r\ncarefully bandaged his throat with woollen wrappers, and proceeded to\r\nthe assembly, where, when called upon to rise and speak, he made signs\r\nthat he had lost his voice. Witty men said that the orator had not\r\ncaught a sore throat, but a silver quinsy during the night. Soon the\r\nwhole people learned that he had been bribed, and as they would not\r\nlisten to him when he rose to explain his conduct, but hooted and\r\ngroaned, some one rose and said, \"Men of Athens, will you not listen to\r\na man who has such a golden tongue?\" The people thereupon sent Harpalus\r\naway, and fearing that inquiry might be made after the treasure which\r\nthe orators had received, they instituted a vigorous search through\r\nevery man's house, except that of Kallikles the son of Arrhenides, which\r\nthey would not allow to be searched because his newly-married wife was\r\nthere. These particulars we learn from the history of Theopompus.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Demosthenes, wishing to put a good face on the matter, passed a\r\ndecree in the assembly, that the senate of the Areopagus should enquire\r\ninto the matter, and punish those who were found guilty. However he was\r\none of the first whom the senate found guilty: and, although he came\r\ninto court and pleaded his cause, he was condemned to pay a fine of\r\nfifty talents, and was imprisoned in default. Overwhelmed with shame at\r\nthis disgrace, and being also in weak health, he could not bear to\r\nremain in prison, and made his escape with the secret assistance of his\r\nkeepers. We read that after he had got a short distance from Athens he\r\nsaw that he was being pursued by several of his political opponents, and\r\ntried to hide from them. When, however, they came up to him, addressed\r\nhim by his name, and begged him to receive money for his journey from\r\nthem, assuring him that they had brought it to give to him and had\r\npursued him for no other reason, Demosthenes burst into tears and\r\nexclaimed: \"I may well be sorry to leave a home where my very enemies\r\ntreat me with more kindness than any friends I am likely to find abroad\r\nwill do.\" Demosthenes was much depressed by his banishment, and spent\r\nmost of his time in Troezene or Ægina, looking towards Attica with\r\ntears in his eyes. He is said during his exile to have uttered many\r\nunmanly sentiments, very unworthy of his bold speeches when in power. On\r\nleaving the city he stretched out his hands towards the Acropolis and\r\nexclaimed: \"Athena, patroness of Athens, why dost thou delight in those\r\nthree savage creatures, the owl, the snake, and the people?\" He used to\r\ndissuade the young men whom he met and conversed with during his travels\r\nfrom taking part in political life, and would say that such were the\r\nmiseries, the fears, the jealousies, backbitings, and ceaseless\r\nstruggles by which a public man is beset, that if at the outset of his\r\nlife he had known them, and had been offered his choice between two\r\ncourses, one leading to the bema and the public assembly, and the other\r\nto utter annihilation, he would unhesitatingly have chosen the latter.\r\n\r\nXXVII. While he was in exile Alexander died, and the Hellenic\r\nconfederacy was again revived under Leosthenes, a brave general, who\r\nshut up Antipater in Lauria and besieged him there. Now, Pytheas the\r\norator and Kallimedon, surnamed the \"crab,\" who were exiled from Athens,\r\njoined Antipater, and travelled about Greece in company with his friends\r\nand ambassadors, urging the cities not to join the Athenians and revolt\r\nfrom Macedonia. Demosthenes, on the other hand, joined the embassy sent\r\nout by Athens and co-operated with them, striving to induce the Greeks\r\nto rise against the Macedonians and drive them out of Greece. In\r\nArcadia, Phylarchus tells us that a wordy battle took place between\r\nPytheas and Demosthenes at a public meeting in which Pytheas was\r\nadvocating the cause of Macedonia, and Demosthenes that of Greece.\r\nPytheas said that we may always know that there is sickness in a house\r\nif we see asses' milk carried into it, and that a city must be in a bad\r\nway if it received an embassy from Athens. To this Demosthenes answered\r\nby turning his own illustration against him, for, he said, asses' milk\r\nis brought into houses to cure the sick, and Athenians come into other\r\ncities to save them from ruin. The people of Athens were so delighted\r\nwith the conduct of Demosthenes in this matter that they decreed his\r\nrestoration. The decree was proposed by Demon, one of the township of\r\nPæania, and a cousin of Demosthenes; and a trireme was sent to Ægina\r\nto fetch him home. When he landed at Peiræus he was met by the whole\r\npeople, and by all the priests and archons, all of whom greeted him\r\nwarmly. On this occasion, Demetrius of Magnesia relates that he raised\r\nhis hands to heaven and congratulated himself on having returned home\r\nmore gloriously than Alkibiades, because he had persuaded, not forced,\r\nhis countrymen to receive him back. As the fine imposed upon him still\r\nremained in force, for the people could not alter a verdict at their\r\npleasure, they made use of a legal fiction. It was the custom at the\r\nfestival of Zeus the Preserver to pay a sum of money to those who\r\nornamented the altar for the sacrifice: they charged Demosthenes with\r\nthis office, and ordered him to execute it for the sum of fifty talents,\r\nwhich was the amount of his fine.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. He did not, however, long enjoy his restoration, for the Greeks\r\nwere soon utterly ruined. In the month of Metageitnion[134] the battle\r\nof Krannon took place, in Boedromion a Macedonian garrison entered\r\nMunychia, and in Pyanepsion Demosthenes was put to death in the\r\nfollowing manner:--As soon as it became known that Antipater and Kraterus\r\nwere marching upon Athens, Demosthenes and his party escaped out of the\r\ncity, and the people, at the instance of Demades, condemned them to\r\ndeath. As they had dispersed to all quarters of Greece, Antipater sent\r\nmen in pursuit of them, the chief of whom was Archias, who was surnamed\r\nthe Exile-hunter. This man, who was a citizen of Thurii, is said once to\r\nhave been a tragic actor, and to have studied his art under the\r\ncelebrated Polus of Ægina. Hermippus reckons Archias among the pupils of\r\nthe orator Lakritus, while Demetrius tells us that he was a student of\r\nphilosophy of the school of Anaximenes. This Archias tore away from the\r\nshrine of Æakus at Ægina the orator Hypereides, Aristonikus of Marathon,\r\nand Himeræus, the brother of Demetrius of Phalerum, who had taken\r\nsanctuary there, and sent them to Antipater at Kleonæ, where they were\r\nput to death. It is even said that Hypereides had his tongue cut out.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Hearing that Demosthenes was sitting as a suppliant in the temple\r\nof Poseidon at Kalauria,[135] Archias crossed over thither in some small\r\nboats with a guard of Thracian mercenaries, and tried to persuade\r\nDemosthenes to leave the temple and accompany him to Antipater,\r\npromising that he should not be ill-treated. Demosthenes had a strange\r\ndream the night before that he was contending with Archias in acting a\r\nplay, and that although he acted well and delighted his audience, yet he\r\nwas beaten by Archias, who was better furnished with stage properties\r\nand appliances. Wherefore, when Archias tried to cajole him, Demosthenes\r\nlooked him full in the face, and, without rising, said, \"Archias, your\r\nacting never affected me on the stage, nor will your promises now.\"\r\nUpon this Archias became angry, and savagely threatened him. \"Now,\" said\r\nDemosthenes, \"you speak like the true Macedonian that you are; but just\r\nnow you were acting a part. So now wait for a little while until I have\r\nsent a letter home.\" Saying this, he retired into the inner part of the\r\ntemple, took his tablets as though about to write, placed his pen in his\r\nmouth and bit it, as he was wont to do when meditating what he should\r\nwrite, and after remaining so for some time, covered his head with his\r\nrobe and leaned it on his arms. The soldiers standing at the door of the\r\ntemple jeered at him for a coward, and Archias walked up to him and bade\r\nhim rise, repeating his assurance that he would make Antipater his\r\nfriend. Demosthenes, as soon as he perceived that the poison was\r\nbeginning to work upon him, uncovered his head, and, looking steadfastly\r\nat Archias, said, \"Now, as soon as you please, you may play the part of\r\nKreon in the play, and throw my body to the dogs without burial. But I,\r\ngood Poseidon, leave thy temple while I am yet alive, and will not\r\nprofane the sanctuary by my death there, though Antipater and his\r\nMacedonians have not feared to pollute it with murder.\" Having spoken\r\nthese words, he asked them to support him by the arms, as his strength\r\nwas fast failing him, and as they were assisting him to walk past the\r\naltar he fell with a groan and died there.\r\n\r\nXXX. As for the poison, Ariston says that it was contained in his\r\npen,[136] as has been related. But one Pappas, from whom Hermippus has\r\nborrowed his account of the scene, says that when Demosthenes fell\r\nbefore the altar, in his tablets were found written the opening words of\r\na letter, \"Demosthenes to Antipater,\" and nothing more. All were\r\nsurprised at the suddenness of his death, but the Thracian mercenaries\r\nat the door declared that they saw him take the poison out of a little\r\ncloth and put it into his mouth. They imagined that what he swallowed\r\nwas gold; but a maid-servant that waited on him told Archias, in answer\r\nto his inquiries, that Demosthenes had for a long time carried about a\r\npacket containing poison, to be used in case of need. Eratosthenes\r\nhimself writes that Demosthenes carried the poison in a hollow bracelet\r\nwhich he wore on his arm. It would be tedious to notice all the\r\ndiscrepancies to be found in the numerous accounts which have been\r\nwritten of the death of Demosthenes; but I will mention that Demochares,\r\na relative of Demosthenes, states his belief that he did not die by\r\npoison, but by the provident care of the gods, who rescued him from the\r\ncruelty of the Macedonians by a swift and painless death. He perished on\r\nthe sixteenth day of the month Pyanepsion, which is observed as a day of\r\nthe strictest fasting and humiliation by the women who celebrate the\r\nfestival of the Thesmophoria.[137] The people of Athens soon afterwards\r\nbestowed on Demosthenes the honours which he deserved, by erecting a\r\nbrazen statue in memory of him, and decreeing that the eldest of his\r\nfamily should be maintained in the Prytaneum for ever. On the base of\r\nthe statue was inscribed the celebrated couplet:\r\n\r\n   \"Could'st thou have fought as well as thou could'st speak,\r\n    The Macedonian ne'er had ruled the Greek.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a complete mistake to suppose, as some writers do, that\r\nDemosthenes himself composed this couplet in Kalauria just before he\r\ntook the poison.\r\n\r\nXXXI. A short time before my own first visit to Athens, the following\r\nincident is said to have taken place. A soldier, being summoned by his\r\ncommanding officer to be tried for some offence, placed all his money in\r\nthe hands of the statue of Demosthenes, which are represented as clasped\r\ntogether. Beside the statue grew a small plane-tree, and several leaves\r\nof this tree, either blown there by chance, or placed there on purpose\r\nby the soldier, concealed and covered up the money, so that it remained\r\nthere a long while. At last the soldier returned and found it, and as\r\nthe circumstance became widely known, many literary men seized the\r\nopportunity of making epigrams on this striking proof of the\r\nincorruptible honesty of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nDemades did not long enjoy the honour which he had won, for the gods, in\r\norder to avenge Demosthenes, led him to Macedonia, where he perished\r\nmiserably by the hands of those whose favour he had so basely courted.\r\nHe had long been disliked by the Macedonian court, and at last a clear\r\nproof of his treasonable practices was discovered in an intercepted\r\nletter of his to Perdikkas, in which he urged him to seize the throne of\r\nMacedonia and save the Greeks, who were now hanging by an old and rotten\r\nthread (meaning Antipater). On the evidence of this letter, Deinarchus\r\nof Corinth charged him with treason, and Kassander was so infuriated at\r\nhis perfidy that he first stabbed Demades's own son while in his\r\nfather's arms, and then ordered him to be put to death. Thus, by\r\ninflicting on him the greatest misery which a man could suffer, he\r\nproved to him the truth of that saying of Demosthenes which he had never\r\nbefore believed, that traitors first of all betray themselves. You now,\r\nmy friend Sossius, know all that I have either read or heard concerning\r\nthe life of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF CICERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. They say that Cicero's mother Helvia[138] was of good family and\r\nconversation, but as to his father the accounts are in opposite\r\nextremes. For some say that the man was born and brought up in a\r\nfuller's workshop; but others carry back his pedigree to Tullus\r\nAttius,[139] who reigned with distinction among the Volsci and fought\r\nagainst the Romans with no small vigour. However, the first of the\r\nfamily who got the cognomen of Cicero[140] must have been a man of note,\r\nand this was the reason why his descendants did not reject the name, but\r\nwere well pleased with it, though it was a matter of jeering to many:\r\nfor the Latins call a vetch Cicer, and the first Cicero had at the end\r\nof his nose a cleft or split, slightly marked as we may suppose, like\r\nthe cleft in a vetch, whence he got the cognomen. Indeed Cicero himself,\r\nthe subject of this Life, on his friends advising him when he was first\r\na candidate for office and began to engage in public life, to get rid of\r\nthe name and take another, is reported to have boldly replied that he\r\nwould strive to make the name of Cicero more glorious than that of\r\nScaurus and Catulus. While he was quæstor in Sicily, and causing a\r\nsilver offering to the gods to be made, he had inscribed on it his first\r\ntwo names, Marcus and Tullius, but in place of the third he jocosely\r\nordered the artist to cut the figure of a vetch by the side of the\r\ncharacters. This then is what is recorded about the name.\r\n\r\nII. They say that Cicero's mother gave birth[141] to him, after a\r\npainless and easy labor, on the third day of the new calends, on which\r\nthe magistrates now offer up prayers and sacrifices on behalf of the\r\nEmperor. It is said that a vision appeared to his nurse and foretold her\r\nthat she was nurturing a great blessing for all Romans. Such things as\r\nthese are generally considered to be mere dreams and idle talk, but in\r\nhis case Cicero soon showed that it was a real prophecy when he was of\r\nage to be taught, for he was conspicuous for his natural talent and got\r\na name and reputation among the boys, so that their fathers used to\r\nvisit the schools out of desire to see Cicero, and to inquire of his\r\nfamed quickness and capacity for learning; but the ill-educated part\r\nwere angry with their sons when they saw them giving Cicero a place in\r\nthe midst of them in the public roads by way of honour. Cicero, who had\r\na talent, such as Plato[142] requires in a nature that loves learning\r\nand loves wisdom, for embracing all knowledge and undervaluing no kind\r\nof learning and discipline, happened to show a strong inclination to\r\npoetry: and indeed a small poem of his is still preserved, which was\r\nwritten when he was a boy: it is entitled Pontius Glaucus,[143] and is\r\nin tetrameter verse. In the course of time he applied himself to the\r\nMuse of such arts with still more versatility, and got the reputation of\r\nbeing not only the first orator, but also the best poet[144] among the\r\nRomans. Now his oratorical reputation continues to the present day,\r\nthough there has been no small innovation in matters that concern\r\neloquence; but as to his poetical reputation, owing to many poets of\r\ngenius who have come after him, its fate has been to die away altogether\r\nunknown to fame and unhonoured.\r\n\r\nIII. After being released from his youthful studies, he heard Philo[145]\r\nof the Academy, whom of all the scholars of Kleitomachus, the Romans\r\nadmired most for his eloquence and loved most for his manners. At the\r\nsame time by his intimacy with the Mucii,[146] who were statesmen and\r\nleaders in the Senate, he was aided in getting some knowledge of the\r\nlaw; and for a time, also, he served in the army under Sulla in the\r\nMarsic war.[147] But seeing that matters were coming to a civil war, and\r\nfrom a civil war to a pure monarchy, betaking himself to a life of quiet\r\nand contemplation, he kept company with learned Greeks and applied\r\nhimself to the sciences, until Sulla had got the mastery, and the state\r\nseemed to have received a settlement. During this time Chrysogonus,[148]\r\na freedman of Sulla, having laid an information about a man's property\r\nas being one of those who were put to death during the proscriptions,\r\nbought it for two thousand drachmæ. Roscius, the son and heir of the\r\ndead man, complained of this, and showed that the property was of the\r\nvalue of two hundred and fifty talents, on which Sulla, being convicted,\r\nwas angry, and with the assistance of Chrysogonus instituted a\r\nprosecution against Roscius for parricide. No one gave Roscius help, but\r\nall were deterred through fear of the severity of Sulla, on which the\r\nyoung man in his desolate condition had recourse to Cicero, who was also\r\nimportuned by his friends, who urged that he would never again have a\r\nmore splendid opportunity of gaining a reputation nor a more honourable.\r\nAccordingly Cicero undertook the defence, and gained credit by his\r\nsuccess; but, being afraid of Sulla, he went into Greece,[149] giving\r\nout that his bodily health required care. And indeed he was lean and had\r\nlittle flesh, and owing to weakness of stomach, he took little food, and\r\nthat of a light kind late in the day; his voice was full and good, but\r\nhard and unmanageable, and owing to the vehemence and passion of his\r\nlanguage being continually carried through the higher notes it gave him\r\nalarm about his health.\r\n\r\nIV. On his arrival at Athens[150] he became a hearer of Antiochus of\r\nAskalon, being pleased with the easy flow of his speech and his graceful\r\nmanner, but he did not like his doctrinal innovations. For Antiochus was\r\nnow seceding from what is called the New Academy, and deserting the sect\r\nof Karneades; whether it was that he was influenced by the evidence and\r\nby the senses, or as some say, through rivalry and differences with the\r\nfollowers of Kleitomachus and the partisans of Philo, he was changing to\r\nbe a cultivator of the Stoic principle in most things. But Cicero liked\r\nthe other doctrines better, and attached himself to them in preference,\r\nintending, if he should altogether be excluded from public affairs, to\r\nremove himself to Athens from the Forum and public life and live there\r\nin tranquillity with philosophy. But when news came that Sulla was dead,\r\nand his body being strengthened by discipline was attaining a vigorous\r\nhabit, and his voice being now brought under management had become\r\npleasant to the ear and powerful, and was suitably adapted to his habit\r\nof body, and his friends from Rome were sending him many letters and\r\nexhortations, and Antiochus strongly urged him to engage in public\r\naffairs, he began anew to fashion his oratorical power, as if it were an\r\ninstrument, and to rouse afresh his political capacity, by exercising\r\nhimself in the proper discipline and attending the rhetoricians of\r\nrepute. Accordingly he sailed to Asia and Rhodes;[151] and among the\r\nAsiatic orators he attended the instruction of Xenokles of Adramyttium,\r\nand Dionysius of Magnesia, and Menippus of Caria; and in Rhodes, the\r\nrhetorician Apollonius, the son of Molo, and the philosopher\r\nPoseidonius. It is said that Apollonius, who did not understand the\r\nLatin language, requested Cicero to perform his exercises in Greek; and\r\nthat Cicero readily complied, thinking that his faults would thus be\r\nbetter corrected. When he had finished his exercise, all the rest were\r\namazed, and vied with one another in their praises, but Apollonius,\r\nwhile he was listening to Cicero, showed no approbation, and when Cicero\r\nhad finished he sat for a long time wrapped in thought; and as Cicero\r\nshowed his dissatisfaction, he said, \"You indeed, Cicero, I commend and\r\nadmire, but I pity the fortune of Greece, seeing that the only excellent\r\nthings which were left to us have been transferred to the Romans by you,\r\nlearning and eloquence.\"\r\n\r\nV. Now Cicero, full of hope in his course to a political career, had his\r\nardour dulled by an oracular answer. For on consulting the god at\r\nDelphi[152] how he might get most fame, the Pythia bade him make his own\r\nnature, and not the opinion of the many, his guide in life. At first he\r\nlived with reserve at Rome, and was slow in offering himself for\r\nmagistracies, and was undervalued, being called Greek and pedant, names\r\ncurrent among and familiar to the lowest citizens. But as he was\r\nnaturally ambitious and was urged on by his father and friends, he\r\ndevoted himself to assisting persons in their causes, and he did not\r\napproach the highest distinction by gradual steps, but at once blazed\r\nforth in reputation, and was far superior to those who exerted\r\nthemselves in the Forum. It is said that he was as defective as\r\nDemosthenes in action, and that accordingly he carefully devoted himself\r\nfirst to Roscius[153] the comedian, and then to Æsopus the tragedian. Of\r\nthis Æsopus it is told, that when he was representing on the stage\r\nAtreus deliberating how he should revenge himself on Thyestes, and one\r\nof the servants suddenly ran past him, being transported out of his\r\nreason by his feelings he struck the man with his sceptre and killed\r\nhim. Cicero derived no small power of persuasion from his action.[154]\r\nHe used scoffingly to say of the orators who bawled loud,[155] that\r\nbecause of their weakness they had recourse to shouting, like lame men\r\nleaping on horses. His readiness at sarcasm and other sharp sayings was\r\nconsidered well adapted to courts of justice and clever, but by over use\r\nof it he gave offence to many and got the character of an ill-disposed\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nVI. Being elected quæstor[156] at a time of scarcity of corn, and having\r\ngot Sicily as his province, he gave offence to the people at first by\r\ncompelling them to send corn to Rome. But afterwards, when they had\r\nproof of his care and justice and mildness, they respected him as they\r\nnever had any governor before. And when many young Romans of good repute\r\nand noble birth, who were under a charge of neglect of discipline and\r\nbad behaviour in the war, were sent up to the prætor of Sicily, Cicero\r\npleaded for them in a remarkable manner, and gained their acquittal.\r\nBeing accordingly greatly elated at all this, on his journey to Rome, as\r\nhe tells us, a ludicrous incident happened to him. In Campania[157]\r\nfalling in with a man of rank, whom he considered to be a friend of his,\r\nhe asked him what the Romans said about his conduct in Sicily, and what\r\nthey thought of it, supposing that the city was full of his name and of\r\nhis measures, and upon the man replying, \"But where have you been all\r\nthis time Cicero?\" he was completely dispirited that his fame was lost\r\nin the city as in a boundless sea and had produced no glorious result to\r\nhis reputation; but on reflection he abated much of his ambition,\r\nconsidering that he was striving for fame as for a thing indefinite and\r\none which had no attainable limit. However all along there abided in him\r\nan exceeding love of praise and a strong passion for fame, which, often\r\ndisturbed much of his sound judgment.\r\n\r\nVII. But when he began to engage more actively in public concerns, he\r\nthought it a shame that artisans, who make use of inanimate instruments\r\nand tools, should be acquainted with the name of each and its place and\r\nuse, and that the political man, whose public acts are effected by the\r\nagency of men, should be indolent and indifferent about the knowledge of\r\nhis fellow-citizens. Accordingly he not only accustomed himself to\r\nremember persons' names, but he also knew the place in which every man\r\nof note dwelt, and the spot where he had his property, and the friends\r\nwith whom he was familiar and his neighbours; and whatever road in Italy\r\nhe was traversing, Cicero could easily tell and point out the lands and\r\nhouses of his friends. As he had only a small property, though\r\nsufficient and adequate to his expenses, he obtained credit by accepting\r\nneither pay nor presents for his services as an advocate, and most\r\nparticularly by his undertaking the prosecution against Verres,[158] who\r\nhad been prætor of Sicily. Verres, who had been guilty of great\r\nmalversation, was prosecuted by the Sicilians, and Cicero caused his\r\nconviction, not by speeches, but in a manner, as one may say, by not\r\nspeaking at all. For as the prætors favoured Verres, and were putting\r\noff the trial to the last day by adjournments and tricks, and it was\r\nclear that the space of one day would not be sufficient for the\r\nspeeches and the trial would not be brought to a conclusion, Cicero got\r\nup and said that the case required no speeches, and bringing forward the\r\nwitnesses and taking their evidence he told the judices to give their\r\nvote. Yet many lively sayings of his at that trial are recorded. The\r\nRomans call a castrated hog \"verres.\" Now when a man of the class of\r\nlibertini named Cæcilius, who was under the imputation of Judaism,\r\nwished to put aside the Siceliots and be the prosecutor of Verres,\r\nCicero said \"What has a Jew to do with a verres?\" Verres also had a son\r\ngrown up, who was reputed not to have regard to his youthful beauty as a\r\nperson of free birth ought to have. Accordingly when Cicero was reviled\r\nfor his effeminacy by Verres, he replied, \"A man should find fault with\r\nhis sons at home.\"[159] The orator Hortensius did not venture directly\r\nto defend the cause of Verres, yet he was induced to give him his\r\nassistance when the damages were assessed, for which he had received an\r\nivory sphinx as his reward. Upon Cicero saying something to him in an\r\noblique way, and Hortensius replying that he had no skill in solving\r\nænigmas, Cicero answered, \"And yet you have the sphinx[160] at home.\"\r\n\r\nVIII. Verres being convicted, Cicero laid the damages at seventy-five\r\nten thousands, and yet he fell under suspicion of having lowered the\r\ndamages[161] for a bribe. However the Siceliots were grateful, and\r\nduring his ædileship[162] they came and brought many things from the\r\nisland, from none of which did Cicero make any gain, but he availed\r\nhimself of the men's desire to honour him so far as to cheapen the\r\nmarket. He possessed a fine place at Arpi,[163] and he had an estate\r\nnear Naples, and another near Pompeii,[164] neither of them large: he\r\nhad also the marriage portion of his wife Terentia[165] to the amount of\r\nten ten thousands, and a bequest which amounted to nine ten thousands of\r\ndenarii. With these means he lived honourably and moderately, enjoying\r\nthe company of the Greeks who were familiar with him, and of the Romans\r\nof learning: he rarely, if ever, lay down to table before sunset, and\r\nnot so much because of his occupations, as because of his health, which\r\nsuffered much from the stomach. He was also exact and careful in other\r\nmatters that concerned the care of his body, and he employed both\r\nfriction and walking a fixed number of times. By thus regulating his\r\nhabit of body he maintained it free from disease, and equal to undergo\r\nmany and great trials and labours. He gave up his father's house to his\r\nbrother, and he fixed his own residence on the Palatine, in order that\r\nthose who paid their respects to him might not be troubled by coming a\r\ngreat distance; and people used to come daily to his doors to pay their\r\nrespects, no fewer than those who waited on Crassus because of his\r\nwealth, and on Pompeius because of his influence with the soldiers,\r\nwhich two were at that time highest in repute and chief of the Romans.\r\nPompeius also courted Cicero, and Cicero's policy contributed greatly\r\nto the power and credit of Pompeius.\r\n\r\nIX. Though there were many candidates with him for the prætorship,[166]\r\nand men of note, he was proclaimed first of all; and he was considered\r\nto have discharged his judicial functions with integrity and skill. It\r\nis said that Licinius Macer, a man who of himself had great weight in\r\nthe city, and who was also supported by Crassus, being tried before\r\nCicero for peculation, was so confident in his power and the exertions\r\nmade on his behalf, that while the judices were giving their votes he\r\nwent home, and after cutting his hair with all speed, and putting on a\r\nclean dress, as if he had been acquitted, he was about to return to the\r\nForum; but on Crassus meeting him near the hall door and telling him\r\nthat he was condemned by all the votes, he turned back, took to his bed\r\nand died. And the circumstance brought Cicero credit for his careful\r\nadministration of justice. Vatinius[167] was a man whose manner was\r\nsomewhat rough and contemptuous towards the magistrates when he was\r\npleading before them, and his neck was full of swellings: on one\r\noccasion when he was before Cicero, he made a certain demand, and as\r\nCicero did not grant it forthwith, but deliberated some time, Vatinius\r\nsaid that he should not hesitate about it if he were prætor, on which\r\nCicero quickly answered, \"But I have not such a neck as you.\"\r\nWhile Cicero had still two or three days in his office, some person\r\nbrought Manilius[168] before him on a charge of peculation; but Manilius\r\nhad the goodwill of the people and their zeal in his favour, as it was\r\nconsidered that he was attacked on account of Pompeius, whose friend he\r\nwas. On Manilius asking for time Cicero gave him only one day, which was\r\nthe next; and the people were angry, inasmuch as the prætors were\r\naccustomed to allow ten days at least to those who were accused. The\r\ntribunes also brought Cicero to the Rostra and found fault with him, but\r\nhe prayed to be heard, and he said that as he had always behaved to\r\naccused persons with forbearance and kindness, so far as the laws\r\nallowed, he thought it would be harsh not to do so in the case of\r\nManilius, and accordingly he had purposely limited him to the only day\r\nwhich was at his disposal as prætor, for that to throw the trial into\r\nthe period of another prætor's jurisdiction was not the part of one who\r\nwas willing to help another. These words wrought a wonderful change in\r\nthe people, and with many expressions of goodwill they prayed him to\r\nundertake the defence of Manilius. Cicero readily undertook it, and\r\nchiefly for the sake of Pompeius who was absent, and coming before the\r\npeople he again harangued them, in bold terms censuring the oligarchal\r\nfaction and the enviers of Pompeius.\r\n\r\nX. Cicero was invited to the consulship[169] no less by the\r\naristocratical party than by the many who for the interest of the state\r\ngave him their aid, and for the following reason. The changes which\r\nSulla had introduced into the constitution at first appeared\r\nunseasonable, but now they seemed to the many by length of time and\r\nusage to have received a kind of settlement, and not a bad one; but\r\nthere were those who sought to shake and change the present condition of\r\naffairs for the sake of their own gain and not for the public good,\r\nwhile Pompeius was still fighting with the kings in Pontus and Armenia,\r\nand there was no power in Rome able to resist those who were for change.\r\nThese men had for their head a bold man and an ambitious and one of\r\nversatile temper, Lucius Catilina, who in addition to other great crimes\r\nhad once laboured under the imputation of unlawful commerce with his\r\nvirgin daughter, and of murdering his own brother,[170] and being afraid\r\nof being punished for this he persuaded Sulla to proscribe his brother\r\namong those who were doomed to die, as if he were still alive. Him the\r\nevil-minded took for their leader, and they gave various pledges to one\r\nanother, and among these they sacrificed a man and ate of his\r\nflesh.[171] Catilina had corrupted a large part of the youth in the city\r\nby supplying every one of them with pleasure and banquets, and amours\r\nwith women, and furnishing unsparingly the expense for all this. All\r\nEtruria was roused to revolt, and the greater part of Gaul within the\r\nAlps: and Rome was exposed to the greatest hazard of change, on account\r\nof the inequality in properties, for those who had most reputation and\r\nlofty bearing had impoverished themselves by theatrical expenses and\r\nentertainments, and love of magistracies and building, and the wealth\r\nhad all come into the hands of men of mean birth and low persons, so\r\nthat things needed only a slight inclination, and it was in the power of\r\nevery man who had courage for the thing to unsettle the state, which of\r\nitself was in a diseased condition.\r\n\r\nXI. However Catilina, wishing to secure a stronghold, was a candidate\r\nfor the consulship, and he was high in hope that he should be the\r\ncolleague of Caius Antonius, a man who of himself was not calculated to\r\nbe a leader either for good or bad, but one who would add force to\r\nanother who was a leader. It was from seeing this that the majority of\r\nthe honourable and the good encouraged Cicero to the consulship, and as\r\nthe people readily seconded them, Catilina was rejected, and Cicero and\r\nCaius Antonius were elected. And yet Cicero alone of the candidates was\r\nthe son of an eques, not of a senator.\r\n\r\nXII. Now the designs of Catilina still remained unknown to the many, but\r\ngreat struggles awaited the consulship of Cicero. For in the first\r\nplace, those who by the laws of Sulla were excluded from magistracies,\r\nbeing neither weak nor few, became candidates and attempted to gain\r\npopular favour, and they made many charges against the tyranny of Sulla\r\nwhich were indeed true and just, but yet they were disturbing the state\r\nof affairs at an unfit time and out of season; and in the next place the\r\ntribunes brought forward measures to the same purpose, in which they\r\nproposed an administration composed of ten men[172] with full powers,\r\nwhose instructions were to have authority to sell the public property in\r\nall Italy and in all Syria, and all that had lately been acquired by\r\nPompeius, to try whom they pleased, to send them into exile, to colonise\r\ncities, to take money from the treasury, and to maintain and raise as\r\nmany soldiers as they might require. Accordingly others of the nobles\r\nwere in favour of the law, and especially Antonius, the colleague of\r\nCicero, who expected to be one of the ten. It was supposed also that he\r\nwas acquainted with the designs of Catilina, and was not averse to them\r\non account of the magnitude of his debts, which chiefly gave alarm to\r\nthe nobles. And this was the first object that Cicero directed his\r\nattention to, and he caused the province of Macedonia[173] to be given\r\nto Antonius, and Gaul, which was offered to himself, he declined; and\r\nby these favours he gained over Antonius like a hired actor to play a\r\nsecond part to himself on behalf of his country. Now when Antonius was\r\ngained and had become tractable, Cicero, being emboldened, opposed\r\nhimself to those who were for making change. Accordingly, in the Senate,\r\nhe made an attack upon the law, and so alarmed the promoters of it that\r\nthey had nothing to say against him. When they made a second attempt,\r\nand being fully prepared invited the consuls to appear before the\r\npeople, Cicero, nothing alarmed, bade the Senate follow him, and coming\r\nforward, he not only caused the rejection of the law, but made the\r\ntribunes give up even the rest of their measures and to yield to his\r\noverpowering eloquence.\r\n\r\nXIII. For this man most of all showed the Romans what a charm eloquence\r\nadds to a good thing, and that justice is invincible if it be rightly\r\nexpressed in words, and that it befits him who duly directs political\r\naffairs, always in his acts to choose the good instead of that which\r\nmerely pleases, and in his speech to deprive what is useful of that\r\nwhich gives pain. And a sample of his persuasive eloquence was what\r\nhappened in his consulship with respect to the public exhibitions. In\r\nformer times those of the equestrian class were mingled with the crowd\r\nin the theatres and were spectators among the people, just as chance\r\nwould have it; but Marcus Otho[174] in his prætorship was the first\r\nwho, for the sake of distinction, separated the equites from the rest of\r\nthe citizens, and gave them a particular place, which they still retain.\r\nThe people took this as a disparagement of themselves, and when Otho\r\nappeared in the theatre, they hissed for the purpose of insulting him,\r\nbut the equites received him with loud applause. Again the people began\r\nto hiss louder, and the equites to make still greater plaudits. Upon\r\nthis they fell to abusing one another, and kept the theatre in\r\nconfusion. When Cicero heard of this he came, and summoning the people\r\nto the temple of Bellona both rebuked and admonished them, on which they\r\nwent back to the theatre and loudly applauded Otho, and vied with the\r\nequites in doing honour to the man and showing their respect.\r\n\r\nXIV. The conspirators with Catilina[175] at first crouched and were\r\nafraid, but they recovered heart, and assembling together urged one\r\nanother to take matters in hand with more courage before Pompeius\r\nreturned, who was said to be now coming home with his force. Catilina\r\nwas chiefly stirred up by the old soldiers of Sulla, who were planted\r\nall through Italy, but the greatest number and the most warlike of them\r\nwere distributed in the Tuscan cities, and were again forming visions of\r\nrobbery and plunder of the wealth that existed. These men, with\r\nManlius[176] for their leader, one of those who had served with\r\ndistinction under Sulla, were on the side of Catilina, and came to Rome\r\nto assist at the Comitia; for Catilina was again a candidate for the\r\nconsulship, and had resolved to kill Cicero in the tumult of the\r\nelections. The dæmon also seemed to pre-signify what was going on by\r\nearthquakes and lightnings and sights. The information from human\r\ntestimony was indeed clear, but not sufficient for conviction of a man\r\nof reputation and great power, like Catilina. Wherefore Cicero deferred\r\nthe day of election, and summoning Catilina to the Senate questioned him\r\nabout what was reported. Catilina, thinking that there were many in the\r\nSenate who were desirous of change, and at the same time wishing to make\r\na display before the conspirators, gave Cicero an insane answer: \"What\r\nam I doing so strange, if when there are two bodies, one lean and\r\nwasted, but with a head, and the other headless, but strong and large, I\r\nmyself furnish it with a head?\"[177] This allusion of his was to the\r\nSenate and to the people, which made Cicero more alarmed, and putting on\r\nhis armour he was conducted by all the nobles from his house and by many\r\nof the young men to the Campus Martius. And he purposely let the people\r\nhave a glimpse of his armour by loosing his tunic from his shoulders,\r\nand he showed the spectators there was danger. The people were enraged\r\nand rallied round him, and at last by their votes they again rejected\r\nCatilina, and chose Silanus[178] and Murena consuls.\r\n\r\nXV. Not long after the men in Etruria came together to support Catilina,\r\nand were forming themselves into companies; and the appointed day for\r\nexecuting their plan was near, when there came to Cicero's house about\r\nmidnight men who were among the first and most powerful in Rome, Marcus\r\nCrassus, and Marcus Marcellus,[179] and Scipio Metellus; and knocking at\r\nthe door and calling the doorkeeper, they bade him rouse Cicero and\r\ntell him that they were there. And the matter was thus: after Crassus\r\nhad supped, the doorkeeper gave him letters brought by some unknown\r\nman, which were addressed to different persons, and one to Crassus\r\nhimself without a signature. Crassus, having read this letter only, and\r\nseeing that the letter intimated that there would be great bloodshed\r\ncaused by Catilina and that it urged him to quit the city, did not open\r\nthe rest, but went forthwith to Cicero in alarm at the danger, and\r\ndesiring to acquit himself somewhat of the blame which he bore on\r\naccount of his friendship with Catilina. Accordingly Cicero after\r\ndeliberating convened the Senate at daybreak, and taking the letters\r\ngave them to the persons to whom they were directed, and bade them read\r\nthe letters aloud: and all the letters alike gave notice of a\r\nconspiracy. When Quintus Arrius, a man of prætorian rank, reported the\r\nforming of armed companies in Etruria, and news arrived that Manlius\r\nwith a large force was hovering about those cities expecting every\r\nmoment something new from Rome, a decree of the Senate was made to put\r\naffairs in the hands of the consuls, and that the consuls on receiving\r\nthis commission should administer the state as they best could, and save\r\nit. The Senate is not used to do this frequently, but only when they\r\napprehend great danger.\r\n\r\nXVI. Cicero upon receiving this authority intrusted affairs out of the\r\ncity to Quintus Metellus; he undertook the care of the city himself, and\r\nhe daily went forth guarded by so large a body of men, that when he\r\nentered the Forum those who accompanied him occupied a large part of the\r\nground, whereupon Catilina, no longer enduring delay, resolved to make\r\nhis escape to Manlius, and he commissioned Marcius[180] and Cethegus to\r\narm themselves with swords, and going to Cicero's door in the morning on\r\npretence of paying their respects, to fall on him and kill him.\r\nFulvia,[181] a woman of rank, reported this to Cicero by night, and\r\nexhorted him to be on his guard against Cethegus and his associate. The\r\nmen came at daybreak, and as they were not permitted to enter, they fell\r\nto railing and abuse at the doors, which made them still more suspected.\r\nCicero going out called the Senate to the temple of Jupiter the Stayer,\r\nwhom the Romans call Stator, which is situated at the commencement of\r\nthe Sacred Road as you go up to the Palatine. Catilina also came there\r\nwith the rest to make his defence, but none of the senators would sit\r\ndown with him, and all moved from the bench. Catilina began to speak,\r\nbut he was interrupted by cries, and at last Cicero got up and bade him\r\nleave the city; for he said it was fit that as he was administering\r\naffairs with words and Catilina with arms, there should be a wall[182]\r\nbetween them. Accordingly Catilina immediately left the city with three\r\nhundred armed men, and surrounding himself with fasces and axes as if he\r\nwere a magistrate, and raising standards he marched to Manlius; and as\r\nabout twenty thousand men altogether were collected, he visited the\r\ncities and endeavoured to persuade them to revolt, so that there was\r\nopen war, and Antonius was sent to fight with the new rebels.\r\n\r\nXVII. Those who remained in the city of the persons who had been\r\ncorrupted by Catilina were assembled and encouraged by Cornelius\r\nLentulus Sura,[183] a man of illustrious birth, but who had lived a bad\r\nlife and been already expelled from the Senate on account of his\r\nlicentious habits. He was then prætor for the second time, as is the\r\ncustom for those who recover the senatorial dignity. It is said that he\r\ngot the name Sura from the following circumstance. In the times of Sulla\r\nhe was quæstor, and lost and wasted much of the public money. Sulla was\r\nangry at this, and called him to account before the Senate; but\r\nLentulus, coming forward in a very indifferent and contemptuous way,\r\nsaid that he had no account to give, but he offered his leg, as boys\r\nwere wont to do when they had made a miss in playing at ball. From this\r\nhe got the nickname of Sura, for the Romans call the leg 'sura.' Again,\r\nbeing brought to trial he bribed some of the judices, and was acquitted\r\nby two votes only, whereon he said that what he had given to one of the\r\njudices was fairly wasted, for it was enough to be acquitted by a single\r\nvote. Such being the character of the man, and being stirred up by\r\nCatilina, he was further corrupted by the vain hopes held out by false\r\nprophets and jugglers, who recited forged verses and predictions,\r\nalleged to be from the Sibylline books, which declared that it was the\r\nlaw of fate that three Cornelii should be monarchs in Rome, two of whom\r\nhad fulfilled their destiny, Cinna[184] and Sulla, and that the dæmon\r\nwas come and had brought the monarchy to him the third of the Cornelii,\r\nand he ought by all means to accept it, and not to spoil the critical\r\nopportunity by delay like Catilina.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Accordingly Lentulus designed nothing small or trivial, but he\r\ndetermined to kill all the senators, and as many of the rest of the\r\ncitizens as he could, and to burn the city, and spare nobody except the\r\nchildren of Pompeius, whom they intended to seize and keep in their\r\npower as securities for coming to terms with Pompeius, for already there\r\nwas strong and sure report of his returning to Rome from his great\r\nexpedition. A night had been fixed for the attempt, one of the\r\nSaturnalia,[185] and they took and hid in the house of Cethegus swords\r\nand tow and brimstone. They also appointed a hundred men, and assigned\r\nby lot as many parts of Rome to each, in order that by means of many\r\nincendiaries the city might be in a blaze in a short time on all\r\nsides.[186] Others were to stop up the water conduits and to kill those\r\nwho attempted to get water. While this was going on, there happened to\r\nbe at Rome two ambassadors of the Allobroges,[187] a nation which\r\nespecially at that time was in a bad condition and oppressed by the\r\nsupremacy of Rome. The partizans of Lentulus, considering them suitable\r\npersons for stiring up Gaul to revolt, made them privy to the\r\nconspiracy. They gave these men letters to their Senate and letters to\r\nCatilina, promising liberty to the Senate, and urging Catilina to free\r\nthe slaves and to march upon Rome. They also sent with them to Catilina\r\none Titus[188] of Croton to carry the letters. But inasmuch as the\r\nconspirators were unsteady men, who for the most part met one another\r\nover wine and in company with women, and Cicero followed up their\r\ndesigns with labour and sober consideration and unusual prudence, and\r\nhad many men out of their body to keep watch and to help him in tracking\r\nout their doings, and as he had secret conversation with many of those\r\nwho were considered to be in the conspiracy and whom he trusted, he\r\nbecame acquainted with their communication with the strangers, and\r\nlaying an ambuscade by night he seized the man of Croton and the\r\nletters, with the secret assistance of the Allobroges.\r\n\r\nXIX. At daybreak[189] Cicero, assembling the Senate at the temple of\r\nConcord, read the letters and examined the informers. Silanus Junius\r\nalso said that some persons had heard Cethegus say, that three consuls\r\nand four prætors were going to be killed. Piso, a man of consular rank,\r\ngave evidence to the same effect. Caius Sulpicius, one of the prætors,\r\nbeing sent to the house of Cethegus, found there many missiles and arms,\r\nand a great quantity of swords and knives newly sharpened. At length the\r\nSenate having by a vote promised a pardon to the man of Croton on\r\ncondition of his giving information, Lentulus being convicted abdicated\r\nhis office, for he happened to be prætor, and laying down his robe with\r\nthe purple hem before the Senate assumed a dress suitable to the\r\noccasion. Lentulus and his associates were delivered up to the prætors\r\nto be kept in custody, but without chains. It was now evening, and the\r\npeople in crowds were waiting about the temple, when Cicero came forth\r\nand told the circumstance to the citizens, by whom he was conducted to\r\nthe house of a neighbouring friend, for his own house was occupied by\r\nthe women who were celebrating the mysterious rites to a goddess whom\r\nthe Romans called Bona,[190] and the Greeks call Gynæceia. A sacrifice\r\nis made to the goddess annually in the house of the consul by his wife\r\nor his mother in the presence of the Vestal Virgins. Cicero, going into\r\nthe house, deliberated with a very few persons what he should do with\r\nthe men: for he had some scruples about inflicting the extreme\r\npunishment and that which was due to such great crimes; and he hesitated\r\nabout it both from the humanity of his disposition, and because he\r\nfeared that he might seem to be too much elated with his power and to be\r\nhandling severely men who were of the highest rank and had powerful\r\nfriends in the State; and if he treated them leniently, he dreaded\r\ndanger from them. For he considered that they would not be well content\r\nif they were punished short of death, but would break forth in all\r\nextravagance of audacity and add fresh indignation to their old\r\nvillainy; and that he should be judged a coward and a weak man,\r\nespecially as the many had by no means a good opinion of his courage.\r\n\r\nXX. While Cicero was thus doubting, there was a sign to the women who\r\nwere sacrificing: for though the fire seemed to have gone out, the altar\r\nsent forth from the ashes and burnt bark a large and brilliant\r\nblaze.[191] This alarmed the women, except the sacred virgins, who urged\r\nTerentia, the wife of Cicero, to go with all speed to her husband and\r\ntell him to take in hand what he had resolved on behalf of his country,\r\nfor the goddess was displaying a great light to lead him to safety and\r\nhonour. Terentia, who generally was not a woman of a mild temper nor\r\nnaturally without courage, but an ambitious woman, and as Cicero himself\r\nsays,[192] more ready to share in his political perplexities than to\r\ncommunicate to him her domestic matters, reported this to her husband\r\nand stimulated him against the conspirators: in like manner too his\r\nbrother Quintus and Publius Nigidius, one of his philosophical\r\ncompanions, whose advice he used in the most and chiefest of his\r\npolitical measures. On the following day[193] there was a discussion in\r\nthe Senate about the punishment of the conspirators, when Silanus, who\r\nwas first asked his opinion, said that they ought to be taken to prison\r\nand suffer the extreme punishment: and all who spoke in succession\r\nacceded to this opinion, till it came to the turn of Caius Cæsar, who\r\nwas afterwards Dictator. Cæsar, who was then a young man and in the very\r\nbeginning of his rise to power, and already in his policy and his hopes\r\nhad entered on that road by which he changed the state of Rome into a\r\nmonarchy, though he eluded the penetration of the rest, caused great\r\nsuspicion to Cicero, without however giving him any hold for complete\r\nproof; but there were some heard to say that he came near being caught\r\nand yet had escaped from Cicero. However, some say that Cicero purposely\r\noverlooked and neglected the information against Cæsar through fear of\r\nhis friends and his power, for it was plain to every man, that the\r\nconspirators would rather become an appendage[194] to Cæsar's acquittal,\r\nthan Cæsar would become an appendage to their punishment.\r\n\r\nXXI. When, then, it came to Cæsar's[195] turn to deliver his opinion, he\r\nrose and expressed it against putting the men to death, but he proposed\r\nto confiscate their property and remove them to the cities of Italy of\r\nwhich Cicero might approve, and there keep them confined till Catilina\r\nwas defeated. The proposal was merciful and the speaker most eloquent,\r\nand Cicero added to it no small weight, for when Cicero rose[196] he\r\nhandled the matter both ways, partly arguing in favour of the first\r\nopinion and partly in favour of Cæsar's; and all his friends thinking\r\nthat Cæsar's opinion was for the advantage of Cicero, for he would be\r\nsubject to less blame if he did not condemn the men to death, chose the\r\nsecond opinion rather, so that even Silanus himself changed and made his\r\nexplanation, saying that neither had he delivered his opinion for death,\r\nfor that the extreme punishment to a Roman senator was the prison. After\r\nthe opinion was given, Catulus Lutatius was the first to oppose it; and\r\nhe was followed by Cato, who in his speech vehemently urged suspicion\r\nagainst Cæsar, and so filled the Senate with passion and resolution that\r\nthey passed a vote of death against the men. With respect to the\r\nconfiscation of their property Cæsar made opposition, for he did not\r\nthink it fair that they should reject the merciful part of his\r\nproposition and adopt the most severe part. As many of them made violent\r\nresistance, he invoked the tribunes, who however paid no attention to\r\nthe call, but Cicero himself gave way and remitted that part of the vote\r\nwhich was for confiscation.\r\n\r\nXXII. Cicero went with the Senate to the conspirators, who were not all\r\nin the same place, but kept by the different prætors. He first took\r\nLentulus[197] from the Palatine and led him through the Sacred Road and\r\nthe middle of the Forum, with the men of highest rank in a body around\r\nhim as his guards, the people the while shuddering at what was doing and\r\npassing by in silence, and chiefly the youth, who felt as if they were\r\nbeing initiated with fear and trembling in certain national rites of a\r\ncertain aristocratical power. When Cicero had passed through the Forum\r\nand come to the prison, he delivered Lentulus to the executioner and\r\ntold him to put him to death; he then took down Cethegus and every one\r\nof the rest in order and had them put to death. Seeing that there were\r\nstill many members of the conspiracy standing together in the Forum, who\r\ndid not know what had been done and were waiting for the night,\r\nsupposing that the men were still alive and might be rescued, Cicero\r\nsaid to them in a loud voice, \"They have lived.\" In these terms the\r\nRomans are used to speak of death when they do not choose to use words\r\nof bad omen. It was now evening, and Cicero went up from the Forum to\r\nhis house, the citizens no longer accompanying him in silence or in\r\norder, but receiving him with shouts and clapping as he passed along and\r\ncalling him the saviour and founder of his country. And numerous lights\r\nilluminated the streets, for people placed lamps and torches at their\r\ndoors. The women too showed lights from the roofs to honour the man and\r\nin order to see him going home, honourably attended by the nobles; most\r\nof whom, having brought to an end great wars and entered the city in\r\ntriumph, and added to the Roman possessions no small extent of land and\r\nsea, walked along confessing to one another that the Roman people were\r\nindebted for wealth and spoils and power to many living commanders and\r\ngenerals, but for their security and safety to Cicero alone, who had\r\nremoved from them so great a danger. For it was not the preventing of\r\nwhat was in preparation and the punishing of the doers which appeared\r\nworthy of admiration, but that he had quenched the greatest of dangers\r\nthat ever threatened the State with the least evils, and without\r\ndisturbance and tumult. For most of those who had flocked to\r\nCatilina[198] as soon as they heard of the fate of Lentulus and Cethegus\r\nleft him and went away: and Catilina, after fighting a battle with\r\nthose who remained with him against Antonius, perished and his army with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nXXIII. However there were some who were ready to abuse Cicero for this\r\nand to do him harm, and they had for their leader among those who were\r\ngoing to hold magistracies, Cæsar as prætor, and Metellus[199] and\r\nBestia as tribunes. Upon entering on office, while Cicero had still a\r\nfew days in authority, they would not let him address the people, and\r\nplacing their seats above the Rostra they would not permit him to come\r\nforward to speak; they told him that he might, if he chose, take the\r\noath usual on giving up office and then go down. Upon this Cicero came\r\nforward as if he were going to take the oath, and when he had procured\r\nsilence, he swore not the usual oath, but one of his own and a new oath,\r\nto the effect that he had saved his country and preserved the supremacy\r\nof Rome: and the whole people confirmed the truth of his oath. At this\r\nCæsar and the tribunes, being still more vexed, contrived other cavils\r\nagainst Cicero, and a law was brought forward by them that Pompeius and\r\nhis army should be recalled on the pretext of putting down the power of\r\nCicero. But Cato, who was then tribune, was a great help to Cicero and\r\nto the whole State, and he opposed himself to Cæsar's measures with\r\nequal authority and greater good opinion. For he easily stopped other\r\nmeasures, and he so extolled the consulship of Cicero in a speech to the\r\npeople, that they voted to him the greatest honours that had ever been\r\nconferred and called him the father of his country; for it seems that\r\nCicero was the first on whom this title was conferred, upon Cato having\r\nso entitled him before the people.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Cicero, who had at that time the chief power in the State, made\r\nhimself generally odious, not by any ill acts, but by always praising\r\nand glorifying himself to the great annoyance of many people. For there\r\nwas neither assembly of Senate nor people nor court of justice in which\r\na man had not to hear Catilina talked of and Lentulus. Finally, he\r\nfilled his books and writings with his own praises, and though his\r\noratory was most agreeable and had the greatest charm, he made it\r\nwearisome and odious to the hearers by his unseemly habit, which stuck\r\nto him like a fatality. However, though he had such unmingled ambition,\r\nhe was far removed from envying others, for he was most bountiful in his\r\npraises of those before him and those of his own time, as we may see\r\nfrom his writings. There are also many sayings of his recorded; for\r\ninstance, he said of Aristotle, that he was a river of flowing gold, and\r\nof the dialogues of Plato, that Jupiter, if it were his nature to use\r\nlanguage, would speak like him. Theophrastus he was used to call his own\r\nspecial luxury. Being asked about the speeches of Demosthenes,[200]\r\nwhich he thought the best, he answered, the longest. Yet some of those\r\nwho pretend to be imitators of Demosthenes, dwell on an expression of\r\nCicero, which is used in a letter to one of his friends, that\r\nDemosthenes sometimes nodded in his speeches; but the great and\r\nadmirable praise which he often bestows on the man, and that he entitled\r\nhis own orations on which he bestowed most labour, those against\r\nAntonius, Philippics, they say nothing about. Of the men of his own time\r\nwho gained a reputation for eloquence and learning, there is not one\r\nwhose reputation he did not increase either by speaking or writing in\r\nfavourable terms of him. When Cæsar was in power he obtained from him\r\nthe Roman citizenship for Kratippus[201] the Peripatetic, and he\r\nprevailed on the Areopagus to pass a vote and to request him to stay in\r\nAthens and instruct the young, as being an ornament to the city. There\r\nare letters from Cicero to Herodes,[202] and others to his son, in which\r\nhe exhorts to the study of philosophy under Kratippus. He charged\r\nGorgias[203] the rhetorician with leading the young man to pleasure and\r\ndrinking, and banished him from his society. This and a letter to Pelops\r\nof Byzantium are almost the only Greek letters of his which are written\r\nwith any passion, in which he properly rebukes Gorgias, if he was\r\nworthless and intemperate, as he was considered to be; but his letter to\r\nPelops is in a mean and complaining tone, and charges Pelops with having\r\nneglected to procure for him certain honours and public testimonials\r\nfrom the Byzantines.\r\n\r\nXXV. All this proceeded from his ambition, and also the circumstance\r\nthat he was often carried away by the impetuosity of his oratory to\r\ndisregard propriety. He once spoke in favour of Munatius,[204] who after\r\nbeing acquitted prosecuted Sabinus, a friend of Cicero, who is said to\r\nhave been so transported with passion as to say, \"Do you suppose,\r\nMunatius, that you were acquitted on your trial for your own merits, and\r\nnot because I spread much darkness over the court when there was light?\"\r\nHe gained applause by a panegyric on Marcus Crassus from the Rostra, and\r\na few days after he abused him, on which Crassus observed, \"Did you not\r\nlately praise me in the same place?\" to which Cicero replied, \"Yes, for\r\npractice sake, exercising my eloquence on a mean subject.\" Crassus\r\nhaving remarked on one occasion that none of the Crassi had lived in\r\nRome to be more than sixty years of age, and afterwards denying that he\r\nhad said so, and observing, What could have led him to say this? Cicero\r\nreplied, \"You know that the Romans would be glad to hear it and so you\r\nwished to get their favour.\" When Crassus observed that he liked the\r\nStoics, because they proved that the good man was rich,[205] \"Consider,\"\r\nsaid Cicero, \"if they do not rather prove that the wise man possesses\r\neverything.\" Now Crassus was charged with being fond of money. One of\r\nthe sons of Crassus who was considered to resemble a certain Axius, and\r\nso to attach ill fame to his mother in respect to Axius, had made a\r\nspeech in the Senate with applause, and Cicero being asked what he\r\nthought of him said, He is Axius Crassus.[206]\r\n\r\nXXVI. When Crassus[207] was about to set out for Syria, he wished Cicero\r\nto be his friend rather than his enemy, and he said in a friendly manner\r\nthat he wished to sup with him, and Cicero received him readily. A few\r\ndays after when some of his friends spoke with him about Vatinius, and\r\nsaid that Vatinius sought a recollection and to be on good terms with\r\nhim, for he was then at enmity with Cicero. \"Surely,\" said Cicero,\r\n\"Vatinius too does not want to sup with me.\" Such was his behaviour to\r\nCrassus. As to Vatinius, who had tumours in his neck, and was on one\r\noccasion pleading a cause, Cicero called him a tumid orator. Hearing\r\nthat Vatinius was dead, and being shortly after certainly informed that\r\nhe was still living, \"Ill betide the man,\" said he, \"who lied so ill.\"\r\nMany of the senators were dissatisfied with Cæsar's carrying a measure\r\nfor the distribution of the land in Campania among the soldiers, and\r\nLucius Gellius,[208] who was also one of the oldest of them, said, that\r\nit should never take place while he lived. \"Let us wait,\" said Cicero,\r\n\"for Gellius asks for no long delay.\" There was a certain Octavius[209]\r\nwho had the ill-repute of being a native of Libya, and on the occasion\r\nof a certain trial he said that he could not hear Cicero. \"And yet,\"\r\nsaid Cicero, \"your ear is not without a hole in it.\" Metellus Nepos\r\nobserving that Cicero by giving testimony against persons had caused\r\nmore to be condemned than he had caused to be acquitted by undertaking\r\ntheir cause, \"Well,\" said he, \"I admit that I have more credit than\r\neloquence.\" A certain youth who was charged with giving poison to his\r\nfather in a cake, spoke with great confidence, and said that he would\r\nabuse Cicero; \"I would rather have this from you,\" said Cicero, \"than a\r\ncake.\" Publius Sextius[210] had Cicero with others as his advocate in a\r\ncause, but he chose to say everything himself and would let nobody else\r\nspeak, and when it was plain that he would be acquitted and the judices\r\nwere giving their votes, Cicero said, \"Make the most of your opportunity\r\nto-day, for to-morrow you will be a mere nobody.\" One Publius\r\nConsta,[211] who set up for a lawyer, but was an ignorant and stupid\r\nfellow, was called as a witness by Cicero on a trial. On Consta saying\r\nthat he knew nothing, \"Perhaps,\" said Cicero, \"you suppose that you are\r\nasked about legal matters.\" Metellus Nepos during a dispute with Cicero\r\noften repeated, \"Who is your father?\" on which Cicero said, \"As for\r\nyourself, your mother has made this answer rather difficult for you.\"\r\nNow the mother of Nepos was considered to be an unchaste woman, and\r\nhimself a fickle kind of man. On one occasion he suddenly deserted his\r\noffice of tribune and sailed off to join Pompeius[212] in Syria, whence\r\nhe returned with just as little reason. Nepos had buried his teacher\r\nPhilagrus with more than usual respect, and set upon his tomb a raven of\r\nstone: \"In this,\" said Cicero, \"you have acted wiser than your wont, for\r\nhe taught you to fly rather than to speak.\" Marcus Appius in a certain\r\ntrial prefaced his speech with saying that his friend had prayed him to\r\nexhibit vigilance and judgment and fidelity: \"Are you then,\" said\r\nCicero, \"so iron-hearted as to exhibit not one of such great qualities\r\nas your friend prayed you to do?\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. Now the use of bitterish taunts against enemies or opposing\r\nadvocates may be considered as belonging to the orator's business; but\r\nthe attacking of any persons whom he fell in with, for the purpose of\r\nmaking them ridiculous, brought great odium upon him. I will record a\r\nfew instances of this also. He called Marcus Aquinius,[213]\r\nAdrastus,[214] because he had two sons-in-law who were in exile. Lucius\r\nCotta,[215] who held the office of censor, was very fond of wine, and it\r\nhappened that Cicero during his canvass for the consulship was athirst,\r\nand as his friends stood around him while he was drinking, \"You have\r\ngood reason to be afraid,\" said he, \"lest the censor should deal harshly\r\nwith me for drinking water.\" Meeting Voconius,[216] who was conducting\r\nthree very ugly daughters, he said aloud:\r\n\r\n   \"'Gainst Phoebus' will his children he begat.\"\r\n\r\nMarcus Gellius,[217] who was supposed not to be the son of free parents,\r\nwas once reading some letters to the Senate with a clear and loud voice,\r\nwhen Cicero said, \"Don't be surprised; he too is one of those who have\r\npractised their voices.\" When Faustus,[218] the son of Sulla who had\r\nbeen dictator in Rome and proscribed many to the death, having got into\r\ndebt and squandered most of his substance, advertised his household\r\nstuff for sale, Cicero said that he liked this proscription better than\r\nhis father's.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.[219] He thus became odious to many, and the partizans of Clodius\r\ncombined against him on the following occasion. Clodius was a man of\r\nnoble birth, young in years, but bold and impudent in his designs. Being\r\nin love with Pompeia, Cæsar's wife, he got into his house secretly by\r\nassuming the dress and the guise of a lute-player; for the women were\r\ncelebrating in Cæsar's house those mysterious rites which the men were\r\nnot allowed to see; and as there was no man there, Clodius being still a\r\nyouth and not yet bearded hoped to slip through to Pompeia with the\r\nwomen. But as it was night when he got into a large house, he was\r\nperplexed by the passages; and as he was rambling about a female slave\r\nof Aurelia, Cæsar's mother, saw him and asked him his name. Being\r\ncompelled to speak, he said that he was looking for a servant of\r\nPompeia, named Abra, but the woman perceiving that it was not a female\r\nvoice cried out and called the women together. They shut the doors and\r\nsearching every place found Clodius, who had hid himself in the chamber\r\nof the girl with whom he came into the house. The affair being noised\r\nabroad Cæsar put away Pompeia, and a prosecution[220] for an offence\r\nagainst religion was instituted against Clodius.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Now Cicero was a friend of Clodius, and in the affair of Catilina\r\nfound him a most zealous assistant and guardian of his person; but as\r\nClodius in answer to the charge relied on not having been in Rome at the\r\ntime, and maintained that he was staying in places at a very great\r\ndistance, Cicero bore testimony that Clodius had come to his house[221]\r\nand spoken with him on certain matters; which was true. However people\r\ndid not suppose that Cicero gave his testimony from regard to truth, but\r\nby way of justifying himself to his wife Terentia.[222] For Terentia had\r\na grudge against Clodius on account of his sister Clodia, who was\r\nsupposed to wish to marry Cicero, and to be contriving this by the aid\r\nof one Tullus, who was one of the nearest companions and intimates of\r\nCicero, and as Tullus was going to Clodia, who lived near, and paying\r\nattention to her, he excited suspicion in Terentia. Now as Terentia was\r\nof a sour temper and governed Cicero, she urged him to join in the\r\nattack on Clodius and to give testimony against him. Many men also of\r\nthe highest character charged Clodius by their testimony with perjury,\r\ndisorderly conduct, bribing of the masses, and debauching of women.\r\nLucullus also produced female slaves to testify that Clodius had sexual\r\ncommerce with his youngest sister when she was the wife of Lucullus.\r\nThere was also a general opinion that Clodius debauched his other two\r\nsisters, of whom Marcius Rex had Terentia and Metellus Celer had Clodia\r\nto wife, who was called Quadrantaria, because one of her lovers put\r\ncopper coins for her in a purse pretending they were silver and sent\r\nthem to her; now the smallest copper coin the Romans called Quadrans. It\r\nwas with regard to this sister that Clodius was most suspected. However\r\nas the people on that occasion set themselves against those who bore\r\ntestimony and combined against Clodius, the judices being afraid\r\nprocured a guard for their protection, and most of them gave in their\r\ntablets with the writing on them confused.[223] It turned out that those\r\nwho were for acquitting him were the majority, and some bribery was also\r\nsaid to have been used. This led Catulus to say when he met the judices,\r\n\"Indeed you did ask for a guard to protect you, for you were afraid that\r\nsome one should take your money from you.\" Upon Clodius saying to Cicero\r\nthat his evidence had no credit with the judices, Cicero replied,\r\n\"However, five-and-twenty[224] of the judices gave me credit, for so\r\nmany of them voted against you; but thirty of them gave you no credit,\r\nfor they did not vote for your acquittal till they had received their\r\nmoney.\" Cæsar, however, when called, gave no evidence against Clodius,\r\nand he denied that he had convicted his wife of adultery, but that he\r\nhad put her away, because Cæsar's wife ought not only to be free from a\r\nshameful act, but even the report of it.\r\n\r\nXXX. Clodius,[225] having escaped the danger, as soon as he was elected\r\ntribune commenced his attack on Cicero, drawing together and agitating\r\nagainst him every thing and all persons. For he gained the favour of the\r\npeople by popular laws, and caused great provinces to be assigned to\r\neach of the consuls, Macedonia to Piso and Syria to Gabinius, and he\r\ncontrived to associate many of the poor citizens in his designs and kept\r\narmed slaves about him. Of the three men who then had the chief power,\r\nCrassus was openly at enmity with Cicero, and Pompeius was playing an\r\naffected part towards both; and as Cæsar was about to march into\r\nGaul[226] with his army, Cicero paying court to him, though he was not\r\nhis friend, but an object of suspicion owing to the affair of Catilina,\r\nasked to accompany him as a legatus. Cæsar accepted the proposal, but\r\nClodius, seeing that Cicero was escaping from his tribunitian power,\r\npretended to be disposed to come to terms with him, and by laying most\r\nblame on Terentia, and always speaking of Cicero in moderate terms and\r\nusing words which imported a favourable disposition, as a man who had no\r\nhatred or ill feeling towards him, but had certain reasonable grounds of\r\ncomplaint to be urged in a friendly way, he completely stopped Cicero's\r\nfears, so that he declined a legation under Cæsar and again applied\r\nhimself to public affairs. At which Cæsar, being irritated, encouraged\r\nClodius against Cicero, and completely alienated Pompeius from him, and\r\nhe himself declared before the people that he did not consider it right\r\nor lawful for men to be put to death without trial, like Lentulus and\r\nCethegus. For this was the charge, and to this Cicero was called to\r\nanswer. Being therefore in danger and under prosecution he changed his\r\ndress and with his hair unshorn went about supplicating the people. But\r\nClodius met him everywhere in the streets with violent and audacious\r\nmen about him, who, with many insolent jeers at Cicero's reverse and\r\nattire, and after pelting him with mud and stones, hindered his\r\nsuppliant applications.\r\n\r\nXXXI. However at first nearly all the body of equites changed their\r\ndress when Cicero did, and not less than twenty thousand young men\r\naccompanied him with their hair uncut and joined in his suppliant\r\nentreaties. When the Senate had met in order to pass a vote that the\r\npeople should change their dress as a public calamity,[227] and the\r\nconsuls opposed it, and Clodius was in arms about the Senate-house, no\r\nsmall number of the senators ran out tearing their clothes and calling\r\naloud. But as this sight neither procured respect nor pity, and Cicero\r\nmust either go into exile or try force and the sword against Clodius, he\r\nentreated Pompeius to aid him, who had purposely gone out of the way and\r\nwas staying on his estate at the Alban hills. And first he sent his\r\nson-in-law Piso[228] to entreat for him, and then he went himself.\r\nPompeius hearing of his coming did not wait to see him, for he had a\r\nstrong feeling of shame towards a man who had made great efforts on his\r\nbehalf, and had carried many public measures to please him, but as he\r\nwas Cæsar's son-in-law, he gave up old obligations at his request, and\r\nslipping out by a different door evaded meeting with Cicero. Cicero\r\nbeing thus betrayed by him and left deserted, fled for refuge to the\r\nconsuls. Gabinius still maintained his hostility, but Piso spoke[229]\r\nmore kindly, and advised him to go out of the way and to yield to the\r\nimpetuosity of Clodius and to submit to the change in circumstances, and\r\nagain to be the saviour of his country, which was involved in civil\r\ncommotion and misfortune through Clodius. Having got this answer Cicero\r\nconsulted with his friends, of whom Lucullus advised him to stay and\r\nsaid that he would gain the superiority; but others advised him to fly,\r\ninasmuch as the people would soon long for him when they were satiated\r\nwith the madness and desperation of Clodius. This was Cicero's own\r\njudgment; and he carried to the Capitol the statue of Athene,[230] which\r\nfor a long time had stood in his house, and to which he paid especial\r\nhonour, and dedicated it with the inscription, \"To Athene the guardian\r\nof Rome;\" and receiving from his friends persons to conduct him safely,\r\nhe left the city about midnight and went by land through Lucania,\r\ndesigning to stay in Sicily.\r\n\r\nXXXII. When it was known that he had fled, Clodius put to the vote the\r\nquestion of his banishment, and issued an edict to exclude him from fire\r\nand water, and that no one should furnish him with a shelter within five\r\nhundred miles[231] of Italy. Now others paid not the slightest regard to\r\nthe edict, for they respected Cicero, and showed him all manner of\r\nkindness and set him on his way: but in Hipponium, a city of Lucania,\r\nwhich the Romans call Vibo,[232] Vibius, a Sicilian, who had derived\r\nmany advantages from Cicero's friendship and had been præfect of the\r\nFabri during his consulship, would not receive Cicero in his house, but\r\nsent him word that he would assign him a spot of ground; and Caius\r\nVergilius,[233] the prætor of Sicily, who had been most intimate with\r\nCicero, wrote to tell him to keep away from Sicily. Whereat desponding\r\nhe set out for Brundusium, and thence attempted to pass over to\r\nDyrrachium[234] with a fair wind; but as it began to blow against him\r\nwhen he was out at sea, he came back the day after, and again set sail.\r\nIt is said that when he had reached Dyrrachium and was going to land,\r\nthere was a shaking of the earth and a violent motion in the sea at the\r\nsame time; from which the diviners prognosticated that his flight would\r\nnot be lasting, for these were signs of change. And though many men\r\nvisited him from good will and the Greek cities vied in sending\r\ndeputations to him, yet he passed his time in despondency[235] and\r\nexceeding grief, for the most part looking to Italy, like those who are\r\ndesperately in love, and in his bearing became very mean and humbled by\r\nreason of his calamity, and so downcast as no one would have expected\r\nfrom a man who had spent his life in such philosophical pursuits. And\r\nyet he often asked his friends to call him not an orator, but a\r\nphilosopher,[236] for he said that he had chosen philosophy as his\r\noccupation, but that he employed oratory as an instrument for his\r\npurposes in his public life. But opinion is powerful to wash out reason\r\nfrom the mind as if it were dye, and to imprint the affects of the\r\nmany[237] by the force of intercourse and familiarity on those who\r\nengage in public life, unless a man be strictly on his guard and come in\r\ncontact with things external in such wise as to have communion with the\r\nthings themselves, not with the affects towards the things.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Clodius, after driving out Cicero, burnt his villas, and burnt\r\nhis house, and built on the ground a temple to Liberty: the rest of\r\nCicero's property[238] he offered for sale, and announced it daily, but\r\nnobody would buy. In consequence of these measures being formidable to\r\nthe aristocratical party, and dragging along with him the people, who\r\nwere let loose to great violence and daring, he made an attack on\r\nPompeius, ripping up some of the things that were settled by him in his\r\nmilitary command. By which Pompeius losing some of his reputation blamed\r\nhimself for giving up Cicero; and changing again he used every effort in\r\nconjunction with Cicero's friends to effect his return. As Clodius\r\nresisted this, the Senate resolved to ratify nothing in the mean time\r\nand to do no public business, unless Cicero was restored. When\r\nLentulus[239] was consul, and the disorder went on increasing so that\r\ntribunes were wounded in the Forum, and Quintus the brother of Cicero\r\nonly escaped by lying among the bodies as if he were dead, the people\r\nbegan to undergo a change of opinion, and one of the tribunes, Annius\r\nMilo, was the first to venture to bring Clodius to trial for violence,\r\nand many sided with Pompeius both from among the people and the\r\nneighbouring cities. Coming forward with them and driving Clodius from\r\nthe Forum, he called the citizens to the vote: and it is said that the\r\npeople never confirmed any measure with so much unanimity. The Senate\r\nvying with the people passed a decree in honour of those cities which\r\nhad served Cicero in his exile, and for the restoration[240] at the\r\npublic expense of his house and villas, which Clodius had destroyed.\r\nCicero was restored in the sixteenth month[241] after his exile, and so\r\ngreat was the joy of the cities and the zeal of all men to meet him,\r\nthat what was afterwards said by Cicero fell short of the truth: for he\r\nsaid that Italy bore him on her shoulders and carried him into Rome. On\r\nwhich occasion Crassus also, who was his enemy before his exile, readily\r\nmet him, and was reconciled to him, to please his son Publius, as he\r\nsaid, who was an admirer of Cicero.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. After the lapse of no long time, watching the opportunity when\r\nClodius was away, Cicero went with a number of persons to the Capitol\r\nand pulled down and broke the tribunitian tablets[242] which contained\r\nthe records of the administration. When Clodius made this a charge\r\nagainst him, Cicero said that Clodius had illegally passed from the\r\npatrician body to the tribunate, and that none of his acts were valid,\r\nat which Cato took offence and spoke against him, not indeed in\r\ncommendation of Clodius, but expressing his mortification at his\r\nmeasures; however he showed that it was an unusual and violent measure\r\nfor the Senate to vote for the rescinding of so many decrees and acts,\r\namong which was his own administration at Cyprus and Byzantium. This led\r\nto a collision between him and Cicero, which did not proceed to anything\r\nopen, but the consequence was that their friendly disposition to one\r\nanother was weakened.\r\n\r\nXXXV. After this Clodius[243] was killed by Milo, who being prosecuted\r\nfor murder got Cicero for his advocate. But the Senate, being afraid\r\nlest there should be some disturbance in the city on the trial of Milo,\r\nwho was a man of high repute and bold spirit, intrusted to Pompeius the\r\nsuperintendence of this and other trials, and commissioned him to\r\nprovide for the security of the city and of the courts of justice.\r\nPompeius in the night surrounded the Forum with soldiers on the heights,\r\nand Milo, fearing that Cicero might be disturbed at the unusual sight\r\nand manage his case worse, persuaded him to be carried in a litter to\r\nthe Forum and to rest there till the judices met and the court was\r\nformed. But Cicero, as it appears, was not only without courage in arms,\r\nbut was timid even when he commenced speaking, and hardly ceased shaking\r\nand trembling in many trials till his eloquence had reached its height\r\nand attained steadiness. When he was the advocate of Murena, on his\r\nprosecution by Cato, he was ambitious to surpass Hortensius, who spoke\r\nwith great applause, and he took no rest the night before, in\r\nconsequence of which exceeding anxiety and wakefulness, his powers were\r\nimpaired and he was considered to have fallen short of his fame. On this\r\noccasion when he came out of the litter to the trial of Milo and saw\r\nPompeius seated on an elevated place as in a camp and arms flashing\r\nall around the Forum, he was confounded and scarcely commenced his\r\nspeech for trembling and hesitation, though Milo himself bravely and\r\ncourageously assisted at the trial and would not deign to let his hair\r\ngrow or to change his dress for a dark one, which seems in no small\r\ndegree to have contributed to his condemnation. But Cicero in all this\r\nwas considered rather to have shown his attachment to his friend than\r\nany cowardice.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. Cicero became also one of the priests, whom the Romans called\r\nAugurs,[244] in place of the younger Crassus after his death among the\r\nParthians. The province of Cilicia[245] being allotted to him and an\r\narmy of twelve thousand legionary soldiers and two thousand six hundred\r\nhorse, he set sail with instructions to keep Cappadocia friendly and\r\nobedient to Ariobarzanes.[246] He accomplished this, and arranged it\r\nwithout any blame and without war; and as he observed that the\r\nCilicians were inclined to a rising on occasion of the defeat of the\r\nRomans by the Parthians and the movements in Syria, he pacified them by\r\na mild administration. Nor would he receive any presents when the kings\r\noffered them, and he relieved the provincials from giving\r\nentertainments: and he himself daily received those who were agreeable\r\nto him at banquets, not in a costly way, but liberally. And there was no\r\ndoorkeeper to his house, nor was he ever seen by any one lying down, but\r\nin the morning he would be standing or walking about in front of his\r\nchamber, where he received those who paid their respects[247] to him. It\r\nis said that he neither punished any one with rods nor allowed any man's\r\ngarment to be rent, nor vented abuse in passion, nor inflicted any\r\npenalty accompanied with contumelious treatment. By discovering that\r\nmuch of the public property was embezzled he enriched the cities, and he\r\nmaintained in their civil rights those who made restoration, without\r\nletting them suffer anything further. He engaged also in a war in which\r\nhe defeated the robbers of Mount Amanus, for which he was saluted by his\r\nsoldiers with the title of Imperator.[248] When Cæcilius[249] the orator\r\nrequested Cicero to send him panthers from Cilicia to Rome for a certain\r\nspectacle, Cicero, who was proud of his exploits, wrote in reply that\r\nthere were no panthers in Cilicia, for they had fled into Caria,\r\nindignant that they were the only things warred upon, while all others\r\nwere enjoying peace. On his voyage back from his province he first put\r\nin at Rhodes, and next tarried at Athens with gladness out of the\r\npleasant recollection of his former residence. After associating with\r\nmen the first for wisdom, and visiting his old friends and intimates and\r\nreceiving due honours from Greece, he returned to Rome at a time when\r\naffairs, as if from violent inflammation, were bursting out into the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. In the Senate, when they were proposing to vote him a triumph,\r\nhe said that he would more gladly follow Cæsar in his triumph, if a\r\nsettlement could be effected; and he privately gave much advice by\r\nwriting to Cæsar, and much by entreating Pompeius, and attempting to\r\nmollify and pacify both of them. But when things were past remedy, and\r\nCæsar was advancing, and Pompeius did not stay, but quitted the city\r\nwith many men of character, Cicero did not join in this flight, and it\r\nwas supposed that he was attaching himself to Cæsar. And it is plain\r\nthat in his resolves he was much perplexed both ways and suffered much;\r\nfor he says in his letters[250] that he did not know which way to turn\r\nhimself, and that Pompeius had an honourable and good cause to fight\r\nfor, but that Cæsar managed things better and was better able to save\r\nhimself and the citizens, so that he knew whom to fly from, but not whom\r\nto fly to. Trebatius, one of Cæsar's friends, wrote to the purport, that\r\nCæsar thought that before all things Cicero ought to put himself on\r\nCæsar's side and to share his hopes, but if he declined by reason of\r\nhis age, he advised him to go to Greece and there to seat himself\r\nquietly out of the way of both; but Cicero, being surprised that Cæsar\r\nhimself did not write, replied in passion that he would do nothing\r\nunworthy of his political life. What appears in his letters is to this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. When Cæsar had set out to Iberia, Cicero immediately sailed to\r\nPompeius. The rest were well pleased that he was come, but Cato on\r\nseeing him rated him in private greatly for joining Pompeius: he said it\r\nwas not seemly in himself to desert that line of policy which he had\r\nchosen from the first; but that Cicero, though he could do more good to\r\nhis country and his friends if he remained at Rome an indifferent\r\nspectator and shaped his conduct by the result, without any reason or\r\nnecessity had become an enemy of Cæsar and had come there to share in\r\ngreat danger. These words disturbed the resolve of Cicero, and also that\r\nPompeius did not employ him in anything of weight. But he was the cause\r\nof this himself, inasmuch as he made no secret of repenting of what he\r\nhad done, and depreciated the resources of Pompeius, and privately\r\nshowed his dissatisfaction at his plans, and abstained not from scoffing\r\nand saying any sharp thing of the allies, though he himself always went\r\nabout in the camp without a smile and with sorrowful countenance; but he\r\ngave cause of laughter to others who had no occasion for it. It is\r\nbetter to mention a few of these things. Domitius[251] was placing in a\r\npost of command a man of no warlike turn, and said, How modest he is in\r\nhis manner and how prudent; \"Why then,\" said Cicero, \"do you not keep\r\nhim to take care of your children?\" When some were commending\r\nTheophanes[252] the Lesbian, who was a Præfectus of Fabri in the camp,\r\nfor his excellent consolation of the Rhodians on the loss of their\r\nfleet, \"What a huge blessing it is,\" he said, \"to have a Greek Præfect!\"\r\nWhen Cæsar was successful in most things and in a manner was blockading\r\nthem, he replied to the remark of Lentulus that he heard that Cæsar's\r\nfriends were dispirited, \"You mean to say that they are\r\nill-disposed[253] to Cæsar?\" One Marcius, who had just arrived from\r\nRome, said that a report prevailed in Rome that Pompeius was blockaded.\r\n\"I suppose you sailed hither then,\" said Cicero, \"that you might see it\r\nwith your own eyes and believe.\" After the defeat Nonnius observed that\r\nthey ought to have good hopes, for that seven eagles were left in the\r\ncamp of Pompeius, \"Your advice would be good,\" said Cicero, \"if we were\r\nfighting with jack-daws.\" When Labienus was relying on certain oracular\r\nanswers, and saying that Pompeius must get the victory, \"Yes,\" said\r\nCicero, \"it is by availing ourselves of such generalship as this that we\r\nhave lost the camp.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIX. After the battle at Pharsalus, in which he was not present by\r\nreason of illness, and when Pompeius had fled, Cato, who had a large\r\narmy at Dyrrachium and a great fleet, asked Cicero to take the command\r\naccording to custom, and as he had the superior dignity of the\r\nconsulship. But as Cicero rejected the command and altogether was averse\r\nto joining the armament, he narrowly escaped being killed, for the young\r\nPompeius and his friends called him a traitor and drew their swords, but\r\nCato stood in the gap and with difficulty rescued Cicero and let him go\r\nfrom the army. Having put in at Brundusium he stayed there waiting for\r\nCæsar, who was delayed by affairs in Asia and in Egypt. But when news\r\ncame that Cæsar was landed at Tarentum[254]; and was coming round by\r\nland to Brundusium, Cicero went to him, not being altogether without\r\nhope, but feeling shame in the presence of many persons to make trial of\r\na man who was his enemy and victorious. However there was no need for\r\nhim to do or say anything unworthy of himself; for when Cæsar saw Cicero\r\ncoming to meet him at a great distance before all the rest, he got\r\ndown, and embraced him and talking with him alone walked several stadia.\r\nFrom this time he continued to show respect to Cicero and friendly\r\nbehaviour, so that even in his reply to Cicero, who had written a\r\npanegyric on Cato, he commended his eloquence and his life, as most\r\nresembling those of Perikles and Theramenes.[255] Cicero's discourse was\r\ncalled Cato, and Cæsar's was entitled Anticato. It is said also that\r\nwhen Quintus Ligarius[256] was under prosecution, because he had been\r\none of Cæsar's enemies and Cicero was his advocate, Cæsar said to his\r\nfriends, \"What hinders us listening after so long an interval to\r\nCicero's speech, since the man has long been adjudged a villain and an\r\nenemy?\" But when Cicero had begun to speak and was making a wonderful\r\nsensation, and his speech as he proceeded was in feeling varied and in\r\ngrace admirable, the colour often changed in Cæsar's face, and it was\r\nmanifest that he was undergoing divers emotions in his mind; but at last\r\nwhen the orator touched upon the battle at Pharsalus, he was so affected\r\nthat his body shook and he dropped some of the writings from his hands.\r\nAccordingly he acquitted the man of the charge perforce.\r\n\r\nXL. After this, as the constitution was changed to a monarchy,\r\nCicero[257] detaching himself from public affairs applied himself to\r\nphilosophy with such young men as were disposed; and mainly from his\r\nintimacy with the noblest born and the first in rank, he again got very\r\ngreat power in the state. His occupation was to compose philosophical\r\ndialogues and to translate and to transfer into the Roman language every\r\ndialectical or physical term; for it is he, as they say, who first or\r\nmainly formed for the Romans the terms Phantasia, Syncatathesis, Epoche,\r\nand Catalepsis, and also Atom, and Indivisible, and Vacuum, and many\r\nother like terms, some of which by metaphor, and others by other modes\r\nof assimilation he contrived to make intelligible and to bring into\r\ncommon use: and he employed his ready turn for poetry to amuse himself.\r\nFor it is said that when he was disposed that way, he would make five\r\nhundred verses in a night. The greatest part of his time he now spent in\r\nhis lands at Tusculum, and he used to write to his friends that he was\r\nliving the life of Laertes,[258] whether it was that he said this in\r\njest, as his manner was, or whether from ambition he was bursting with\r\ndesire to participate in public affairs and was dissatisfied with\r\nmatters as they were. He seldom went down to the city, and when he did,\r\nit was to pay court to Cæsar, and he was foremost among those who spoke\r\nin favour of the honours given to him and were eager always to be saying\r\nsomething new about the man and his acts. Of this kind is what he said\r\nabout the statues of Pompeius, which Cæsar ordered to be set up after\r\nthey had been taken away and thrown down, and they were set up again.\r\nFor Cicero said that by this mild behaviour Cæsar placed the statues of\r\nPompeius, but firmly fixed his own.\r\n\r\nXLI. His intention being, as it is said, to comprehend in one work the\r\nhistory of his country and to combine with it much of Greek affairs and\r\nin fine to place there the stories and myths which he had collected, he\r\nwas prevented by public and many private affairs contrary to his wish,\r\nand by troubles, most of which seem to have been of his own causing. For\r\nfirst of all, he divorced his wife Terentia,[259] because he had been\r\nneglected by her during the war, so that he set out in want even of\r\nnecessaries for his journey, and did not even on his return to Italy\r\nfind her well-disposed to him. For she did not go to him, though he was\r\nstaying some time in Brundusium, and when her daughter, who was a young\r\nwoman, was going so long a journey, she did not supply her with suitable\r\nattendance, nor any means, but she even made Cicero's house void of\r\neverything and empty, besides incurring many great debts. These are the\r\nmost decent reasons for the separation which are mentioned. But Terentia\r\ndenied that these were the reasons, and Cicero made her defence a\r\ncomplete one by marrying no long time after a maid;[260] as Terentia\r\ncharged it, through passion for her beauty, but as Tiro[261] the\r\nfreedman of Cicero has recorded it, to get means for paying his debts.\r\nFor the young woman was very rich and Cicero had the care of her\r\nproperty, being left fiduciary heir. Being in debt to the amount of many\r\nten thousands he was persuaded by his friends and relatives to marry the\r\ngirl, notwithstanding the disparity of age, and to get rid of his\r\ncreditors by making use of her property. But Antonius, who made mention\r\nof the marriage in reply to the Philippics, says that he put out of\r\ndoors his wife with whom he had grown old, and at the same time he made\r\nsome cutting jibes on the housekeeping habits of Cicero as a man unfit\r\nfor action and for arms. No long time after his marriage Cicero's\r\ndaughter died in child-birth, for she had married Lentulus after the\r\ndeath of her former husband Piso. The philosophers from all quarters\r\ncame together to console Cicero, but he bore his misfortune very ill,\r\nand even divorced his wife because he thought that she was pleased at\r\nthe death of Tullia.[262]\r\n\r\nXLII.[263] Such were Cicero's domestic affairs. He had no share in the\r\ndesign that was forming against Cæsar, though he was one of the most\r\nintimate friends of Brutus and was supposed to be annoyed at the present\r\nstate of affairs and so long for the old state more than anybody else.\r\nBut the men feared his temper as being deficient in daring, and the\r\noccasion was one in which courage fails even the strongest natures. When\r\nthe deed was accomplished by the partisans of Brutus and Cassius, and\r\nCæsar's friends were combining against the conspirators, and there was\r\nfear of the city again being involved in civil wars, Antonius, who was\r\nconsul, brought the Senate together and said a few words about concord;\r\nand Cicero, after speaking at length and suitably to the occasion,\r\npersuaded the Senate to imitate the Athenians and decree an amnesty[264]\r\nfor what had been done to Cæsar, and to give provinces to Brutus and\r\nCassius. But none of these things came to a conclusion. For the people\r\nof themselves being transported to pity, when they saw the corpse\r\ncarried through the Forum, and Antonius showed them the garments filled\r\nwith blood and slashed in every part by the swords, maddened by passion\r\nsought for the men in the Forum and ran with fire in their hands to\r\ntheir houses to burn them. The conspirators escaped the danger by being\r\nprepared for it, but as they expected other great dangers, they quitted\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nXLIII. Antonius was forthwith elated, and was formidable to all, as\r\nabout to become sole ruler; but to Cicero most formidable. For Antonius\r\nseeing that Cicero's power was recovering strength in the State, and\r\nknowing that he was closely allied with Brutus, was annoyed at his\r\npresence. And there existed even before this some ill-will between them\r\non account of the unlikeness and difference in their lives. Cicero\r\nfearing these things, first made an attempt to go with Dolabella[265] to\r\nSyria as legatus: but the consuls for the next year, Irtius and\r\nPansa,[266] who were good men and admirers of Cicero, prayed him not to\r\ndesert them, and they undertook if he were present to put down Antonius.\r\nCicero, neither distrusting altogether nor trusting gave up his design\r\nas to Dolabella, and agreed with Irtius to spend the summer in Athens,\r\nand when they had entered on their office, to come back, and he sailed\r\noff by himself. But as there was some delay about the voyage, and new\r\nreports, as the wont is, reached him from Rome that Antonius had\r\nundergone a wonderful change, and was doing and administering everything\r\nconformably to the pleasure of the Senate, and that matters only\r\nrequired his presence to be brought to the best arrangement, himself\r\nblaming his excessive caution turned back to Rome. And he was not\r\ndeceived in his first expectations, so great a crowd of people through\r\njoy and longing for him poured forth to meet him, and near a whole day\r\nwas taken up at the gates and upon his entrance with greetings and\r\nfriendly reception. On the following day Antonius summoned a Senate and\r\ninvited Cicero, who did not come, but was lying down pretending to be\r\nindisposed from fatigue. But the truth appeared to be that he was afraid\r\nof some design against him, in consequence of certain suspicions and of\r\ninformation which reached him on the road. Antonius was irritated at the\r\ncalumny and sent soldiers with orders to bring Cicero or burn his house,\r\nbut as many persons opposed Antonius and urged him by entreaties he took\r\nsecurities only and desisted. And henceforward they continued to pass by\r\nwithout noticing one another and to be mutually on their guard, till the\r\nyoung Cæsar[267] having arrived from Apollonia took possession of the\r\ninheritance of the elder Cæsar, and came to a quarrel with Antonius\r\nabout the two thousand five hundred ten thousands[268] which Antonius\r\ndetained of his substance.\r\n\r\nXLIV. Upon this, Philippus[269] who was married to young Cæsar's\r\nmother, and Marcellus, who was married to his sister, came with the\r\nyoung man to Cicero, and made a compact that Cicero should lend to Cæsar\r\nboth in the Senate and before the people the power that he derived from\r\nhis eloquence and his political position, and that Cæsar should give to\r\nCicero the security that could be derived from money and from arms. For\r\nthe young man had about him many of those who had served under\r\nCæsar.[270] There appeared also to have been some stronger reason for\r\nCicero readily accepting the friendship of Cæsar. For, as the story\r\ngoes, while Pompeius and Cæsar were living, Cicero dreamed[271] that\r\nsome one summoned the sons of the senators to the Capitol, as Jupiter\r\nwas going to appoint one of them chief of Rome, and that the citizens\r\nran eagerly and placed themselves around the temple and the youths\r\nseated themselves in their prætextæ in silence. The doors opened\r\nsuddenly and one by one the youths rising walked round before the god,\r\nwho looked at them all and dismissed them sorrowing. But when young\r\nCæsar was advancing towards him, the god stretched out his hand and\r\nsaid, \"Romans, there is an end to civil wars when this youth becomes\r\nyour leader.\" They say that Cicero having had such a dream as this had\r\nimprinted on his memory the appearance of the youth and retained it\r\ndistinctly, but he did not know him. The following day as he was going\r\ndown to the Campus Martius, the boys who had taken their exercise were\r\nreturning, and the youth was then seen by Cicero for the first time just\r\nas he appeared to him in his dream, and being struck with surprise\r\nCicero asked who were his parents. Now his father was Octavius, not a\r\nman of very illustrious station, but his mother was Attia, a niece of\r\nCæsar. Accordingly Cæsar, who had no children of his own, gave the youth\r\nhis property and family name by his will. After this they say that\r\nCicero took pains to notice the youth when he met him, and the youth\r\nreceived well his friendly attentions; for it had also happened that he\r\nwas born in Cicero's consulship.\r\n\r\nXLV. These were the reasons which were mentioned; but his hatred of\r\nAntonius in the chief place, and then his disposition, which was\r\ngoverned by ambition, attached him to Cæsar in the expectation of adding\r\nto his own political influence Cæsar's power. For the young man went so\r\nfar in paying his court to Cicero as to call him father.[272] At which\r\nBrutus being much annoyed blamed Cicero in his letters to Atticus, that\r\nthrough fear of Antonius he was courting Cæsar and was thus manifestly\r\nnot procuring liberty for his country, but wooing for himself a kind\r\nmaster. However Cicero's son,[273] who was studying philosophy at\r\nAthens, was engaged by Brutus and employed in command in many things\r\nwhich he did successfully. Cicero's power in the city was then at its\r\nheight, and as he could do what he liked, he drove Antonius out and\r\nraised a faction against him and sent out the two consuls Irtius and\r\nPansa[274] to fight against him, and he persuaded the Senate by a vote\r\nto give Cæsar lictors and the insignia of a prætor, as if he were\r\nfighting in defence of their country. But when Antonius had been\r\ndefeated and on the death of the two consuls after the battle the forces\r\njoined Cæsar, and the Senate through fear of a youth who had enjoyed\r\nsplendid success was attempting by honours and gifts to call away from\r\nhim the armies, and to divide his power, on the ground that there was no\r\nneed of troops to defend the state now that Antonius was fled, under\r\nthese circumstances Cæsar being alarmed secretly sent messengers to\r\nCicero, to entreat and urge Cicero to get the consulship for the two,\r\nbut to manage matters as he thought best, and to have the power, and to\r\ndirect the young man who was only desirous of a name and reputation. And\r\nCæsar himself admitted that it was through fear of his troops being\r\ndisbanded and the danger of being left alone, that he had availed\r\nhimself in a time of need of Cicero's love of power by urging him to\r\ntake the consulship, and promising that he would act with him and assist\r\nin the canvass at the same time.\r\n\r\nXLVI. In this way indeed Cicero being very greatly pushed on, he an old\r\nman by a young one, and cajoled, assisted at the canvass of Cæsar[275]\r\nand got the Senate in his favour, for which he was blamed by his friends\r\nat the time, and he shortly after saw that he had ruined himself and\r\nbetrayed the liberty of the people. For when the youth was strengthened\r\nand had got the consulship, he gave himself no concern about Cicero, but\r\nmaking friends with Antonius and Lepidus[276] and uniting his forces\r\nwith theirs, he divided the chief power with them, just as if it were a\r\npiece of property. And a list of above two hundred men was made out, who\r\nwere doomed to die. The proscription of Cicero caused most dispute among\r\nthem in their discussions, for Antonius was not inclined to come to any\r\nterms unless Cicero was the first to be doomed to death, and Lepidus\r\nsided with Antonius, but Cæsar held out against both. They held their\r\nmeeting by themselves in secret near the city Bononia[277] for three\r\ndays, and they met in a place at some distance from the camps which was\r\nsurrounded by a river. It is said that during the first two days Cæsar\r\nstruggled in behalf of Cicero, but that he yielded on the third and gave\r\nup the man. And the matter of their mutual surrender was thus. Cæsar was\r\nto give up Cicero, and Lepidus his brother Paulus,[278] and Antonius was\r\nto give up Lucius Cæsar, who was his uncle on the mother's side. So far\r\ndid they through resentment and rage throw away all human feeling, or\r\nrather they showed that no animal is more savage than man when he has\r\ngotten power added to passion.\r\n\r\nXLVII.[279] While this was going on, Cicero was on his lands at\r\nTusculum, and his brother with him; and on hearing of the proscriptions\r\nthey determined to remove to Astura,[280] a place belonging to Cicero on\r\nthe sea-coast, and thence to sail to Macedonia to Brutus, for there was\r\nalready a rumour about him that he had a force. They were conveyed in\r\nlitters, being worn out by grief; and halting by the way and placing\r\ntheir litters side by side they lamented to one another. Quintus[281]\r\nwas the more desponding, and he began to reflect on his needy condition,\r\nfor he said that he had brought nothing from home; and indeed Cicero was\r\nbut scantily provided for his journey; it was better then, he said, for\r\nCicero to hurry on in his flight, and for him to hasten back and to\r\nprovide himself from home with what he wanted. This was agreed, and\r\nembracing one another with tears they separated. Now Quintus, not many\r\ndays after, was betrayed by his slaves to those who were in search of\r\nhim and put to death with his son. Cicero arrived at Astura, and finding\r\na vessel he immediately embarked, and sailed along the coast to\r\nCircæum,[282] the wind in his favour. When the sailors were wishing to\r\nset sail immediately from thence, whether it was that he feared the sea,\r\nor had not quite despaired of all trust in Cæsar, he landed, and went on\r\nfoot about a hundred stadia on the road to Rome. But again perplexed and\r\nchanging his mind he went down to the sea of Astura; and there he spent\r\nthe night in dreadful and desperate reflections, so that he even formed\r\na design to get secretly into Cæsar's house, and by killing himself on\r\nthe hearth to fasten on him an avenging dæmon. But the fear of tortures\r\ndrove him from this measure also; and after perplexing himself with\r\nother schemes and shifting from one to another, he put himself in the\r\nhands of his slaves to convey him by sea to Capitæ,[283] for he had\r\nlands there and a place of retreat which was very agreeable in summer,\r\nwhen the Etesian winds blow most softly. The place has also a temple of\r\nApollo, a little above the sea. A flock of crows winging their flight\r\nfrom thence with loud cawing approached the vessel of Cicero as it was\r\nrowing to land, and settling at each end of the sail-yard some made a\r\nnoise, and others gnawed the end of the ropes, and all were of opinion\r\nthat the omen was bad. Cicero landed, and going to the villa he lay down\r\nto rest. But most of the crows perched themselves on different parts of\r\nthe window, cawing clamorously; and one of them, going down to the couch\r\nwhere Cicero lay wrapped up, by degrees removed with its beak the\r\ncovering from his face. The slaves seeing this, and considering it a\r\nreproach to them if they should wait to be spectators of their master's\r\nmurder, while even brute beasts came to his aid and cared for him in\r\nhis unmerited misfortune, but they themselves were giving no help,\r\npartly by entreaty, partly using force, took him up and carried him in a\r\nlitter towards the sea.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. In the meantime the murderers with their helpers came on,\r\nHerennius[284] a centurion, and Popilius a tribune, who had once been\r\nprosecuted for parricide and Cicero was his advocate. Finding the doors\r\nclosed they broke them open, and as Cicero was not seen and those who\r\nwere within denied that they knew where he was, it is said that a youth\r\nwho had been brought up by Cicero in liberal studies and learning, and\r\nwas a freedman of Cicero's brother Quintus, Philologus by name, told the\r\ntribune that the litter was being conveyed through the wooded and shady\r\npaths to the sea. Accordingly the tribune, taking a few men with him,\r\nran round to the outlet. And as Herennius was running along the paths,\r\nCicero saw him and bade the slaves place down the litter there; and, as\r\nhis wont was, holding his chin with his left hand he looked steadily on\r\nthe murderers, being all squalid and unshorn, and his countenance wasted\r\nby care, so that most of them covered their faces while Herennius was\r\nkilling him. He stretched his neck[285] out of the litter and was\r\nkilled, being then in his sixty-fourth year. Herennius cut off his head\r\nand the hands, pursuant to the command of Antonius, with which he wrote\r\nthe Philippics. For Cicero himself entitled Philippics the speeches\r\nwhich he wrote against Antonius, and to the present day they are called\r\nPhilippics.\r\n\r\nXLIX. When the head and hands[286] were brought to Rome, Antonius\r\nhappened to be holding an election of magistrates, and when he heard the\r\nnews and saw what had been done, he called out that the proscriptions\r\nwere now at an end. He ordered the head and hands to be placed above the\r\nRostra on the place whence the orators spoke, a sight that made the\r\nRomans shudder, who thought that they saw, not the face of Cicero, but\r\nan image of the soul of Antonius. Still he showed herein one sentiment\r\nof just dealing, for he delivered up Philologus to Pomponia the wife of\r\nQuintus, who having got him into her power, inflicted terrible vengeance\r\nupon him, and among other things compelled him to cut off his flesh bit\r\nby bit, and to roast and eat it. Thus some of the historians have told\r\nthe story, but Tiro, who was Cicero's freedman, makes no mention at all\r\nof the treachery of Philologus.[287] I have heard that Cæsar a long time\r\nafter once went to see one of his daughter's sons,[288] and as the youth\r\nhad in his hands one of Cicero's writings, he was afraid and hid it in\r\nhis vest; the which Cæsar observing took the book and read a good part\r\nof it while he was standing, and then returning the book to the boy\r\nsaid, \"A wise man, my boy, a wise man and a lover of his country.\" As\r\nsoon as Cæsar had finally defeated Antonius, he took Cicero's son[289]\r\nto be his colleague in the consulship, in whose magistracy the Senate\r\nthrew down the statues of Antonius and destroyed all other testimonials\r\nin honour of him, and further decreed that no Antonius should bear the\r\nname of Marcus. That the dæmon reserved for the family of Cicero the\r\nfinal vengeance on Antonius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF DEMOSTHENES AND CICERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The above is all I have been able to find out that is worth being\r\nrecorded about Demosthenes and Cicero. Without attempting to compare\r\ntheir different styles of oratory, I think it necessary to remark that\r\nDemosthenes devoted all his powers, natural and acquired, to the study\r\nof eloquence alone, so that he surpassed all his rivals in the law\r\ncourts and public assembly in perspicuity and ability, all the writers\r\nof declamations in splendour and pomp of diction, and all the\r\nprofessional sophists in accuracy and scientific method. Cicero, on the\r\nother hand, was a man of great learning and various literary\r\naccomplishments. He wrote a considerable number of philosophic treatises\r\nmodelled on the works of the Academic school, and in all his forensic\r\nand political speeches we can detect a desire to let his audience know\r\nthat he was a man of letters. In their speeches, too, we can discern the\r\nimpress of their respective characters. The eloquence of Demosthenes\r\nnever stoops to jest, and is utterly without ornament, but has a\r\nterrible concentrated earnestness, which does not smell of the lamp, as\r\nPytheas sneeringly said, but which reminds us of the ungenial,\r\npainstaking, acrimonious nature of the man: while Cicero often is\r\ncarried by his love of jesting to the verge of buffoonery, and in his\r\npleadings treats serious matters in a tone of most unbecoming levity and\r\nflippancy, as in the oration for Cæcilius he argues that in an age of\r\nsuch luxury and extravagance there can be nothing to wonder at if a man\r\ntakes his pleasure; for not to help oneself to the pleasures which are\r\nwithin one's reach is the part of a madman, seeing that the most eminent\r\nphilosophers have declared the chief felicity of man to consist in\r\npleasure. It is related that when Cato prosecuted Murena, Cicero, who\r\nwas consul at the time, defended him, and cracked many jokes on Cato as\r\nan adherent of the Stoic philosophy, and on the absurdity of the\r\nparadoxes which it maintains. The audience, and even the judges, laughed\r\nheartily; but Cato merely remarked to those near him, with a quiet\r\nsmile, \"Gentlemen, what a witty consul we have.\" Cicero, indeed, seems\r\nto have been fond of laughter and mirth, and his countenance was calm\r\nand smiling; while that of Demosthenes always bore the marks of gloomy,\r\nanxious thought, which caused his enemies, as he himself tells us, to\r\ncall him disagreeable and ill-natured.\r\n\r\nII. In their speeches we may observe that Demosthenes praises himself\r\nwith great moderation, in a manner which can offend no one, and only\r\nwhen he has some more important object in view, while he is usually\r\nmodest and cautious in his language; whereas Cicero's show a ridiculous\r\namount of egotism and craving for applause, when, he demands that \"arms\r\nshall yield to the toga, and the triumphal laurel[290] give place to his\r\ntongue.\" At last he took to praising not only his own deeds, but even\r\nhis spoken and written[291] orations, as though he were engaged in some\r\ncontest with professional rhetoricians like Isokrates or Anaximenes,\r\nrather than endeavouring to lead and reform the Roman people--\r\n\r\n   \"Savage and rude, whose sole delight\r\n    Was with their foes to strive in fight.\"\r\n\r\nA politician must of necessity be a powerful speaker, but it is a\r\ncontemptible thing for him to be too greedy and covetous of applause for\r\nhis fine speeches. Wherefore, in this respect Demosthenes appears far\r\ngraver, and of a nobler nature; for he himself declared that his\r\neloquence came only by practice, and depended on the favour of his\r\naudience, and that he regarded those who boasted of their oratorical\r\npowers as vulgar and despicable characters.\r\n\r\nIII. They were both alike in their power and influence with the people,\r\nwhich caused even the commanders of armies in the field to look to them\r\nfor support; for Demosthenes was courted by Chares, Diopeithes, and\r\nLeosthenes, as was Cicero by Pompeius and the younger Cæsar,[292] as\r\nCæsar himself admits in his memoirs addressed to Mæcenas and Agrippa. We\r\ncannot judge of Demosthenes by that which is said to afford the most\r\ncertain test of a man's true character--his conduct when in power--for he\r\nhas not afforded us any opportunity of doing so, as he would not even\r\ntake the command of the confederacy which he himself organised to oppose\r\nPhilip. Now Cicero was sent to Sicily as quæstor, and to Cilicia and\r\nCappadocia as proconsul, at a period when the love of wealth was at its\r\nheight, and when the Roman generals and governors, thinking it beneath\r\nthem to steal money, used to resort to open robbery. It was not thought\r\ndiscreditable to plunder a province, but he who did so with moderation\r\nwas esteemed as an excellent governor. Cicero on these occasions gained\r\ngreat credit by the many proofs which he gave of indifference to money,\r\nand of goodness and kindness of heart. At Rome itself also, he was\r\nelected nominally consul, but really dictator with unlimited powers to\r\ndeal with Catilina's conspiracy, and he then proved the truth of Plato's\r\naphorism, that a state finds rest from its misfortunes when by good luck\r\na powerful and able man is found to rule it with justice. Demosthenes\r\nagain is said to have made money dishonourably by writing speeches for\r\nother men, as in the case of the speeches with which he secretly\r\nfurnished Phormio and Apollodorus, when they were opposed to one\r\nanother. He also was suspected of receiving bribes from the King of\r\nPersia, and was caught in the act of taking a bribe from Harpalus. Even\r\nif we suppose these charges, supported as they are by the testimony of\r\nso many writers, to be false, yet it is impossible to deny that\r\nDemosthenes, who trafficked in that peculiarly discreditable form of\r\nusury, marine insurances,[293] would not have been able to refuse a\r\npresent offered in all honour by a king, while we have already related\r\nhow Cicero refused to take money from the Sicilians when he was\r\nquæstor,[294] and from the Cappadocians when he was proconsul, and even\r\nfrom his friends, who pressed him to accept large sums when he was\r\nexiled from Rome.\r\n\r\nIV. Moreover, Demosthenes was exiled in great disgrace, after he had\r\nbeen convicted of having received a bribe, while Cicero's banishment was\r\nthe consequence of the noblest action of his life, the ridding his\r\ncountry of wicked men. Wherefore, no one could plead for Demosthenes\r\nwhen he left the country, but the Senate publicly put on mourning for\r\nCicero, grieved for his absence, and refused to transact any business\r\nbefore voting that he should be restored to Rome. Yet Cicero spent his\r\nexile idly in Macedonia, while Demosthenes carried out an important part\r\nof his policy while in exile; for, as has been related, he accompanied\r\nthe Athenian embassy to the various states of Greece, discomfited the\r\nMacedonian ambassadors, and proved himself a far better citizen than\r\nThemistokles or Alkibiades under similar circumstances: moreover, after\r\nhis restoration to Athens, he continued to pursue the same policy of\r\nunceasing opposition to Antipater and the Macedonians, while Lælius\r\nreproached Cicero for sitting silent in the senate-house when young\r\nOctavius Cæsar, before his beard was grown, petitioned to be allowed to\r\nsue for the consulship in spite of the law. Brutus also blamed him for\r\nhaving fostered a greater and harsher tyranny than that which he put\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nV. In conclusion, we must regard the death of Cicero as most pitiable,\r\nthat an old man, through cowardice, should be carried hither and thither\r\nby his slaves, seeking to escape death, and hiding himself from his\r\nfoes, although he could in any case have but a short time to live, and\r\nthen be murdered after all; while Demosthenes, though he did beg\r\nsomewhat for his life, must be admired for his forethought in providing\r\nhimself with the poison, and also for the use which he made of it, to\r\nescape from the cruelty of Antipater even when surrounded by his\r\nsoldiers, and to betake himself to a greater sanctuary, as that of the\r\ngod was unable to protect him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF DEMETRIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. He who first compared the arts to our senses seems to me to have\r\nespecially alluded to the power which they both exhibit of dealing with\r\nobjects of completely contrary qualities. In this respect they coincide;\r\nbut they differ in respect of the use and purpose of the object of which\r\nthey take cognisance. Our senses are influenced indifferently by things\r\nwhite or black, sweet or bitter, soft or hard, for the proper function\r\nof each sense is merely to receive all these impressions and to convey\r\nthem to the mind. But the arts, which have been invented in order to\r\ncultivate the qualities proper to their own nature and to eschew those\r\nwhich are foreign to it, view some with especial favour, as partaking of\r\ntheir own essence, and avoid others as mere untoward accidents. Thus the\r\nart of medicine deals with diseases and the art of music deals with\r\ndiscord merely with a view to produce their respective opposites; while\r\nself-control, justice and wisdom, which are the most perfect of all\r\narts, because they decide not only what is honourable, righteous and\r\nuseful but likewise what is hurtful, shameful, and unjust, do not praise\r\ninnocency which prides itself upon inexperience of evil, but think it to\r\nbe folly and ignorance of what all who intend to live as becomes them\r\nought to know. The ancient Spartans at their feasts used to compel their\r\nhelots to drink a large quantity of wine, and then brought them into the\r\nbanqueting-hall, in order to show the young Spartans what drunkenness\r\nwas like. I think that to instruct one class of men by the ruin of\r\nanother is neither humane nor politic, yet I conceive that it may be\r\nuseful to insert among my Parallel Lives some examples of men who have\r\nbeen careless of their own reputation, and who have used their great\r\nplace and power only to make themselves notorious for evil. The\r\ndescription of such men's lives is not indeed an agreeable task, or a\r\npleasant mode of employing my leisure, still, as Ismenias the Theban,\r\nwhen instructing his scholars how to play the flute, used to say, \"Thus\r\nyou should play;\" and again, \"Thus you should not play,\" while\r\nAntigenides even thought that the young would take more pleasure in\r\nlistening to good flute-players, if they had first heard bad ones, so I\r\nthink that we shall be more inclined both to admire and to imitate the\r\nlives of good men, if we are well acquainted with those of bad ones.\r\nThis book, then, will contain the lives of Demetrius, surnamed the\r\nCity-taker, and of Antonius the Triumvir, men who bear signal witness to\r\nthe truth of Plato's remark, that great men have great vices as well as\r\ngreat virtues. Both alike loved passionately, drank deep, and fought\r\nbravely; both were freehanded, extravagant and arrogant. Fortune served\r\nthem both alike, not only in their lives, for each of them had great\r\nsuccesses and great disasters, each won great empire and lost it again,\r\neach unexpectedly fell and rose again; but also in their deaths, as the\r\none was captured by his enemies, and the same fate all but befell the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nII. Antigonus[295] had two sons by Stratonike the daughter of Korragus,\r\none of whom he named Demetrius after his brother, and the other Philip\r\nafter his father. This is the account given by most historians, though\r\nsome say that Demetrius was not the son, but the nephew, of Antigonus;\r\nbut that, as his father died while he was still an infant and his mother\r\nat once married Antigonus, he was commonly regarded as his son. His\r\nbrother Philip, who was a few years younger than himself, died soon, but\r\nDemetrius grew up to be a tall man, though not so tall as his father.\r\nHis face and figure were of extraordinary beauty, which baffled all the\r\nattempts of painters and sculptors to do it justice. His expression was\r\nat once sweet, commanding and terrible; and his countenance showed all\r\nthe eagerness and fire of youth combined with the calm dignity of a hero\r\nand a king. In like manner his disposition was one which was equally\r\ncapable of inspiring terror or love. He was the pleasantest of\r\ncompanions, more given to wine-drinking and the enjoyment of luxurious\r\nidleness than any other king of his age, and yet he displayed remarkable\r\nenergy and persistence in action; so that he emulated the fame of the\r\ngod Dionysus,[296] being like him a famous warrior, and when the war was\r\nover most capable of thoroughly enjoying the arts of peace.\r\n\r\nIII. He was remarkably fond of his father; and the love and respect\r\nwhich he paid to his father and mother seem to have been prompted by\r\ntrue affection, not by a wish to stand well with those in power. Once\r\nwhen Antigonus was receiving an embassy from some foreign state,\r\nDemetrius, who had been out hunting, came up to his father, kissed him,\r\nand sat down beside him just as he was, with his javelins still in his\r\nhand. When the ambassadors had transacted their business and were about\r\nto leave his presence, Antigonus said to them in a loud voice, \"And,\r\ngentlemen, you may carry home this news about me and my son, that these\r\nare the terms on which we live,\" thinking that so great a proof of his\r\ntrust in his son's loyalty would add considerable strength to his\r\nthrone. So much mistrust and suspicion is bred by absolute power, and so\r\nhard a thing is it for a king to have a companion, that the eldest and\r\ngreatest of the successors of Alexander publicly boasted that he was not\r\nafraid to have his own son sitting by his side with a spear in his hand.\r\nIndeed, this was the only royal family which through many generations\r\nremained unpolluted by this species of crime, for of all the successors\r\nof Antigonus only one, Philip, assassinated his son. All the records of\r\nother dynasties are full of murders of sons, mothers and wives; for the\r\nmurder of brothers had grown to be considered, like an axiom in\r\nmathematics, as a necessary precaution to be taken by all kings on\r\nascending to the throne.\r\n\r\nIV. The following anecdote seems to prove that Demetrius when young was\r\nof a kind and loving nature.\r\n\r\nMithridates, the son of Ariobarzanes, was his friend and companion, and\r\nwas a good subject of Antigonus, of thorough and unsuspected loyalty,\r\nbut at length incurred the suspicion of Antigonus in consequence of a\r\ndream. Antigonus dreamed that he walked over a large and fair plain,\r\nsowing it with gold dust; and that shortly afterwards, returning that\r\nway again, he found nothing but stubble left. While grieving over this\r\nhe heard some men say that Mithridates had gone away to Pontus on the\r\nEuxine, after having gathered the golden harvest. Antigonus was much\r\ndisturbed at this vision, and after having compelled his son to swear\r\nthat he would keep silence about it, told him of the vision, and added\r\nthat he had made up his mind to make away with the man. Demetrius was\r\ngreatly grieved at hearing this, and when the young man, as he was wont\r\nto do, again joined him, and spent the day with him, Demetrius dared not\r\ntell him by word of mouth what danger he was in, because of the oath;\r\nbut he drew him aside into a quiet place, and there, as soon as they\r\nwere alone together, he wrote on the ground with the but-end of his\r\nspear, in sight of the other, the words \"Fly, Mithridates!\" Mithridates\r\nunderstood his meaning, and ran away that very night to Cappadocia. Not\r\nlong afterwards, he showed Antigonus what was the real meaning of his\r\ndream; for he made himself master of an extensive territory, and became\r\nthe founder of the dynasty of the kings of Pontus, which was overthrown\r\nby the Romans in about the eighth generation after him. By this example\r\nwe may perceive the noble and loyal nature of Demetrius.\r\n\r\nV. As the elements, because of their mutual attraction and repulsion,\r\nare, according to Empedokles, always at variance with one another, and\r\nespecially with those with which they happen to be in contact, so, while\r\nall the successors of Alexander were always at war, circumstances from\r\ntime to time caused hostilities between two or more of them to take an\r\nespecially active form. At this time Antigonus was at war with Ptolemy,\r\nand, hearing that Ptolemy had left the island of Cyprus, had landed in\r\nSyria and was ravaging that country, he himself remained in Phrygia, but\r\nsent his son Demetrius to oppose him. Demetrius was now two and twenty\r\nyears of age, and was now for the first time entrusted with the sole\r\nmanagement of an important campaign. As might be expected of so young\r\nand untried a commander, when pitted against a man trained to war under\r\nAlexander, and who had since his death waged many wars with success,\r\nDemetrius was defeated near the city of Gaza with a loss of fifteen\r\nthousand killed and eight thousand prisoners. He also lost his own tent,\r\nhis property, and all his personal attendants. These, however, were\r\nrestored to him, with all his captured friends, by Ptolemy, who sent him\r\na kindly-worded message to the effect that they ought not to fight as\r\nmortal foes, but only for honour and empire.\r\n\r\nDemetrius, after receiving this message and his property, prayed to the\r\ngods that he might not long remain in Ptolemy's debt, but that he might\r\nsoon recompense him in like manner. He did not behave himself like a\r\nyouth who has received a check at the outset of his first campaign, but\r\nrepaired his failure like an old and wary commander, enrolling fresh\r\nsoldiers, providing new supplies of arms, keeping a firm hold over the\r\ncities near him and carefully drilling his new levies.\r\n\r\nVI. Antigonus when he heard of the defeat remarked that Ptolemy had\r\nconquered beardless boys, but that he would have to fight his next\r\nbattle with grown men. He yielded however to his son's entreaty to be\r\nallowed to repair his fault by himself, and, as he did not wish to damp\r\nhis spirits, left him in sole command. Soon after this Killes, Ptolemy's\r\nlieutenant, arrived in Syria with a large force, meaning to chase\r\nDemetrius, whom he supposed to be disheartened by his defeat, quite out\r\nof Syria. But Demetrius by a sudden attack surprised his army and struck\r\nit with panic. He captured the enemy's camp and their general, and took\r\neight thousand prisoners and a great quantity of booty. He was overjoyed\r\nat this, not because he meant to keep what he had won, but to give it\r\nback, and did not so much value the glory and wealth which he had gained\r\nas the opportunity now offered him for repaying the courtesy of Ptolemy.\r\nHe did not presume to do this on his own responsibility, but wrote\r\nfirst to his father. On receiving permission from him to deal as he\r\npleased with the fruits of his victory, he gave costly presents to\r\nKilles and his friends, and sent them back to Ptolemy. This battle\r\nforced Ptolemy to retire from Syria, and brought Antigonus from Kelænæ\r\nrejoicing at the victory and eager to see his son.\r\n\r\nVII. After this Demetrius was sent to subdue the Nabathean Arabs, in\r\nperforming which service he incurred great danger by journeying through\r\nwaterless deserts; but his intrepid courage overawed the barbarians, and\r\nhe returned loaded with plunder, having captured seven hundred camels.\r\n\r\nSeleukus had once lost his capital city, Babylon, which Antigonus took\r\nfrom him; but he had since recovered it by his own arms, and at this\r\ntime was marching with an army to attempt the conquest of the nations\r\nbordering upon India, and the provinces near mount Caucasus. Demetrius,\r\nhoping that he might find Mesopotamia in a defenceless condition,\r\nsuddenly crossed the Euphrates, took Babylon by surprise, and made\r\nhimself master of one of its two citadels, driving out the garrison\r\nplaced there by Seleukus. Demetrius placed seven thousand of his own\r\ntroops in the citadel, ordered his troops to enrich themselves by the\r\nplunder of the surrounding country, and then returned to the sea-coast,\r\nleaving Seleukus more firmly established on his throne than before; for\r\nby plundering the country he seemed to admit that he had no claim to it.\r\nAs Ptolemy was now besieging Halikarnassus, he quickly marched thither\r\nand succeeded in saving the city.\r\n\r\nVIII. As the glory which he won by this action was very great, he and\r\nhis father Antigonus conceived a strong desire to liberate the whole of\r\nGreece from the tyranny of Ptolemy and Kassander. None of the successors\r\nof Alexander ever waged a more just or honourable war than this; for\r\nDemetrius and Antigonus, to gain themselves honour by freeing the\r\nGreeks, spent upon them the treasure which they had won in their\r\nvictories over the barbarians. They determined first of all to attack\r\nAthens, and when one of the friends of Antigonus advised him, if he\r\ncaptured that city, to keep it in his own hands because it was the key\r\nof Greece, Antigonus replied that the best key to a country was the\r\ngoodwill of its people, and that Athens was the watch-tower of the\r\nworld, from whence the glory of his deeds should shine like a\r\nbeacon-light to all mankind.\r\n\r\nDemetrius now set sail for Athens with five thousand talents of silver,\r\nand a fleet of two hundred and fifty vessels. At this time Demetrius of\r\nPhalerum governed the city as Kassander's lieutenant, and a garrison was\r\nplaced in Munychia. By good fortune and good management the fleet\r\narrived on the twenty-fifth day of the month Thargelion, without anyone\r\nbeing aware of its coming. When the ships were seen, they were thought\r\nto form part of Ptolemy's fleet, and preparations were made to give them\r\na friendly reception. At last the officers in command discovered their\r\nmistake, and a scene of great confusion ensued, as they hastily made\r\npreparations to resist the enemy, who were already in the act of\r\ndisembarking; for Demetrius, finding the mouths of the harbours open,\r\nsailed straight in, and could be seen distinctly by all standing on the\r\ndeck of the ship, and making signs to the Athenians to be quiet and keep\r\nsilence. When this was done, he bade a herald proclaim that his father\r\nAntigonus had sent him thither in an auspicious hour to liberate the\r\nAthenians, drive out their Macedonian garrison, and restore to them\r\ntheir own laws and ancient constitution.\r\n\r\nIX. Upon hearing this proclamation the greater part of the people laid\r\ndown their shields at their feet, clapped their hands, and shouted to\r\nDemetrius to come ashore, calling him their saviour and benefactor;\r\nwhile Demetrius of Phalerum thought it necessary to admit so powerful a\r\nman to the city, even though he might have no intention of performing\r\nany of his promises. He therefore sent ambassadors to make their\r\nsubmission. Demetrius received them graciously and sent back with them\r\nAristodemus of Miletus, one of his father's friends. As the Phalerean,\r\nin consequence of this sudden turn of fortune, was more afraid of his\r\nown countrymen than of the enemy, Demetrius, who admired his courage and\r\npublic spirit, took care to have him conveyed in safety to Thebes, to\r\nwhich town he himself wished to go. Demetrius himself now declared that,\r\nalthough he was very eager to view the city, he would not do so until\r\nhe had completely set it free and expelled its garrison. He therefore\r\nsurrounded Munychia with a ditch and rampart, cutting it off from the\r\nrest of the city, and then sailed to attack Megara, which town was held\r\nby a garrison of Kassander's troops.\r\n\r\nAs he heard that Kratesipolis, the wife of Alexander the son of\r\nPolysperchon, a celebrated beauty, was at Patræ, and was not unwilling\r\nto grant him an interview, he left his army encamped in the territory of\r\nMegara and proceeded thither with only a few lightly equipped followers.\r\nWhen he was near the place, he pitched his own tent apart from his men,\r\nthat the lady might not be seen when she came to visit him. Some of the\r\nenemy discovered this, and made a sudden attack upon him. He only\r\nescaped by putting on a mean cloak and running away alone; so that his\r\nlicentiousness very nearly exposed him to ignominious capture. When\r\nMegara was taken the soldiers were about to plunder the city, but the\r\nAthenians with great difficulty prevailed upon Demetrius to spare it. He\r\ndrove out the Macedonian garrison and made the city independent. While\r\nhe was doing this he remembered Stilpon the philosopher, who was reputed\r\nto have chosen for himself a life of retirement and study. Demetrius\r\nsent for him, and inquired whether anything had been stolen from him.\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied Stilpon. \"I saw no one taking away any knowledge.\"\r\nAs, however, nearly all the slaves were stolen, after Demetrius had\r\ntalked graciously to Stilpon and at length dismissed him with the words,\r\n\"My Stilpon, I leave you a free city;\" \"Quite true,\" replied Stilpon,\r\n\"for you have not left us a single slave.\"\r\n\r\nX. Demetrius now returned to Munychia, encamped before it, dislodged the\r\ngarrison, and demolished the fort. And now at the invitation of the\r\nAthenians he proceeded into the city, where he assembled the people and\r\nre-established the ancient constitution. He also promised that his\r\nfather Antigonus would send them one hundred and fifty thousand bushels\r\nof wheat and timber enough to build a fleet of one hundred ships of war.\r\nThus did the Athenians recover their democratic constitution fifteen\r\nyears after it had been dissolved; for during the period between the\r\nLamian war and the battle of Krannon their government had nominally been\r\nan oligarchy, but practically had been a despotism, on account of the\r\ngreat power of Demetrius of Phalerum.\r\n\r\nThe benefits which Demetrius conferred upon the Athenians rendered him\r\nindeed great and glorious; but they rendered his fame invidious by the\r\nextravagant honours which they conferred upon him. They were the first\r\nof all men who bestowed upon Antigonus and Demetrius the title of Kings,\r\na name which they greatly disliked because of its association, and which\r\nmoreover belonged at that time in an especial manner to the descendants\r\nof Philip and Alexander, being the only one of their ensigns of royalty\r\nwhich had not been adopted by other princes. The Athenians too were the\r\nonly people who styled Antigonus and Demetrius their saviour gods, and\r\nthey even abolished the ancient office of the archon from whom the year\r\nreceived its name, and elected in his place every year a priest to\r\nminister at the altar of the saviour gods. They also decreed that their\r\nimages should be woven into the sacred peplus of Athena,[297] with those\r\nof the gods. They consecrated the spot where Demetrius first set his\r\nfoot on the ground when he alighted from his chariot, and built an altar\r\nupon it which was called the altar of \"The Descending Demetrius.\" They\r\nadded two to the number of their tribes, and called them Demetrias and\r\nAntigonis; and consequently they raised the number of the senators from\r\nfive to six hundred, because each tribe supplied it with fifty members.\r\n\r\nXI. But the most outrageous of these devices of Stratokles, for it was\r\nhe who invented all these new extravagancies of adulation, was a decree\r\nthat ambassadors sent to Antigonus or to Demetrius should wear the same\r\nholy title which had hitherto been given to the envoys who conducted the\r\npublic sacrifices to the great festivals at Olympia and at Delphi.\r\nIndeed, in all other respects Stratokles was a man of shameless\r\neffrontery and debauched life, who appeared to imitate the scurrility of\r\nKleon in ancient times by the reckless contempt with which he treated\r\nthe people. He publicly kept a courtesan named Phylakion; and one day\r\nwhen she had bought some necks and brains in the market, he said to her,\r\n\"Why, you have bought us the same things for dinner which we politicians\r\nplay at ball with.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Athenians were defeated in the great sea-fight at Amorgos, he\r\nreached Athens before the news of the disaster, and drove though the\r\nKerameikus with a garland on his head, telling all the people that a\r\nvictory had been won. He decreed a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and had\r\nmeat publicly distributed among the tribes for entertainments. Shortly\r\nafterwards the scattered ships began to arrive, coming home as well as\r\nthey could after the defeat. When the people angrily turned upon him,\r\nresenting the trick which he had played them, he met their clamour with\r\nthe utmost impudence, and said, \"What harm have I done you, in giving\r\nyou two days of happiness?\" Such was the audacity of Stratokles.\r\n\r\nXII. There were, however, other marks of servility, \"hotter than fire,\"\r\nas Aristophanes calls it. One Athenian surpassed Stratokles himself by\r\npassing a decree that Demetrius, whenever he visited Athens, should be\r\nreceived with the same divine honours which were paid to Demeter and\r\nDionysius, and that money should be granted from the public treasury to\r\nthe person who should celebrate the festival of the reception with the\r\ngreatest magnificence, in order that with it he might erect some\r\nmemorial of his success. At last the name of the month Munychion was\r\nchanged to Demetrion, and the first day of it named Demetrias, while the\r\nname of the festival of the Dionysia was changed to Demetria.\r\n\r\nMost of these acts produced manifest signs of the displeasure of the\r\ngods. The peplus, upon which, according to the decree, the images of\r\nZeus and Athena were woven together with those of Antigonus and\r\nDemetrius, was rent in two by a violent gust of wind as it was being\r\nconveyed in procession through the Kerameikus, while a great quantity of\r\nhemlock grew up round the altars which were erected in their honour,\r\nalthough it was not a common plant in the neighbourhood. On the day of\r\nthe festival of Dionysius the procession was put a stop to by excessive\r\ncold, which came entirely out of season, and a severe frost not only\r\ndestroyed all the fig-trees and vines, but even cut off a great part of\r\nthe corn in the blade. In consequence of this, Philippides, who was an\r\nenemy of Stratokles, made the following allusion to him in one of his\r\ncomedies:\r\n\r\n   \"Who was it caused the peplus to be rent?\r\n      Who was it caused the frost to blight our vines?\r\n    The wretch, who worships mortals like to gods,\r\n      His crimes destroy us, not my harmless rhymes?\"\r\n\r\nThis Philippides was a friend of Lysimachus, who for his sake conferred\r\nmany benefits on the Athenians. Lysimachus imagined that the sight of\r\nPhilippides before any campaign or expedition was a certain omen of good\r\nluck; while Philippides was beloved by him on other grounds, because he\r\ngave no trouble and never veiled his thoughts in courtly periphrases.\r\nOnce Lysimachus, meaning to be very civil to him said, \"Philippides,\r\nwhich of my possessions shall I bestow upon you?\" \"Whichever you\r\nplease,\" answered he, \"except your secrets.\" I have mentioned these\r\nincidents in the life of Philippides, in order to mark the distinction\r\nbetween the comic poet and the mob-orator.\r\n\r\nXIII. The most extraordinary of all the honours conferred upon Demetrius\r\nwas the proposal made by Demokleides of Sphettus to go and ask for an\r\noracular response from him about the consecration of the shields at\r\nDelphi. I will write down the exact words of the law as it was proposed.\r\n\"In a happy hour the people decree that one man shall be chosen from the\r\ncitizens of Athens, who shall go to our saviour, and after he has done\r\nsacrifice unto him, shall ask Demetrius, our saviour, in what manner the\r\npeople may, with greatest holiness and without delay, make consecration\r\nof their offerings; and whatever oracle it shall please him to give\r\nthem, the people shall perform it.\" By this absurd flattery the\r\nintellect of Demetrius, at no time very powerful, was thrown completely\r\noff its balance.\r\n\r\nXIV. While he was living at Athens he married Eurydike, a descendant of\r\nthe ancient hero Miltiades, who was the widow of Opheltas, King of\r\nCyrene, and had returned to Athens after her husband's death. The\r\nAthenians were greatly delighted at this marriage, which they regarded\r\nas an honour to their city; though Demetrius made no sort of difficulty\r\nabout marriage, and had many wives at the same time. The chief of his\r\nwives, and the one whom he most respected, was Phila, the daughter of\r\nAntipater, and the widow of Kraterus, who was the most popular with the\r\nMacedonians of all the successors of Alexander during his life, and the\r\nmost lamented by them after his death. Demetrius when very young was\r\nforced by his father to marry this woman, who was too old to be a\r\nsuitable match for him. It is said that when Demetrius expressed his\r\nunwillingness to marry her, his father whispered in his ear the line of\r\nEuripides:\r\n\r\n   \"To gain a fortune, marriage must be dared.\"\r\n\r\nsubstituting the word \"marriage\" for \"bondage,\" which occurs in the\r\noriginal. However, the respect which Demetrius paid to her and to his\r\nother wives did not prevent his intriguing with various courtesans and\r\nmistresses, but he had a worse reputation in this respect than any other\r\nking of his age.\r\n\r\nXV. His father now ordered him to proceed to Cyprus, and to attack\r\nPtolemy, who was in possession of that island. He was forced to obey\r\nthis summons, but as he was very unwilling to desist from the war in\r\ndefence of the liberties of Greece, a much more noble and glorious\r\nstruggle, he first endeavoured to bribe Ptolemy's lieutenant in command\r\nof the garrison of Sikyon and Corinth to evacuate those cities and\r\nrender them independent. As this attempt failed he quickly set sail,\r\ncollected a large force, and proceeded to Cyprus. Here he fought a\r\nbattle with Menelaus, Ptolemy's brother, and at once defeated him.\r\nShortly afterwards Ptolemy himself came to Cyprus with an immense fleet\r\nand army. The two commanders now interchanged messages of scornful\r\ndefiance. Ptolemy bade Demetrius put to sea before his own host\r\nassembled and overwhelmed him, while Demetrius offered to permit\r\nPtolemy to withdraw from Cyprus on condition that he would give up\r\nCorinth and Sikyon. The battle which ensued was one of the deepest\r\ninterest, not merely to the combatants themselves, but to all the other\r\nprinces, since its issue would determine not only the fate of Cyprus and\r\nSyria, but would at once render the victor the most powerful man in all\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nXVI. Ptolemy advanced with a fleet of one hundred and fifty sail, and\r\nordered Menelaus, when the battle was at its hottest, to sally out from\r\nSalamis with his sixty ships and throw the fleet of Demetrius into\r\ndisorder by attacking it in the rear. Demetrius sent ten ships to oppose\r\nthese sixty, for the mouth of the harbour (of Salamis) was so narrow\r\nthat this number sufficed to close it. He himself now got his land force\r\nunder arms, disposed it upon several neighbouring promontories, and put\r\nto sea with one hundred and eighty ships. He bore straight down upon the\r\nenemy's fleet, and completely defeated it. Ptolemy himself, when all was\r\nlost, escaped with only eight ships, the sole survivors of his fleet.\r\nAll the rest were sunk, except seventy which were captured with their\r\ncrews on board. All his numerous train of servants, friends and wives,\r\nall his arms, money and military engines, which were stationed near the\r\nfleet in transports, were captured by Demetrius, who at once conveyed\r\nthem to his own camp.\r\n\r\nAmong the spoil was the celebrated Lamia, who had at first been brought\r\ninto notice by her musical skill, for she was an admirable flute-player,\r\nand who had afterwards become notorious by her amours. Her beauty was at\r\nthis time somewhat faded, yet, although Demetrius was much younger than\r\nherself, she so fascinated and enslaved him by her charms, that, though\r\nmany other women wished for his love, he cared only for her.\r\n\r\nAfter the sea-fight, Menelaus held out no longer, but surrendered\r\nSalamis to Demetrius, with all his ships, and a land army of twelve\r\nhundred cavalry and twelve thousand heavy-armed infantry.\r\n\r\nXVII. Demetrius added to the glory of this brilliant victory by his\r\ngenerous and humane conduct in burying the enemy's dead with great\r\nhonour, and in setting free all his prisoners. He sent a present to the\r\nAthenians of twelve hundred complete suits of armour from the spoils\r\nwhich he had taken. He also sent Aristodemus of Miletus to bear the news\r\nof the victory to his father. Of all his courtiers, this man was the\r\nboldest flatterer, and on this occasion he surpassed himself. After his\r\npassage from Cyprus, he would not allow his ship to approach the land,\r\nbut cast anchor, bade all the crew remain on board, and himself rowed\r\nashore in a small boat. He now walked up to the palace of Antigonus, who\r\nwas in a state of great excitement and impatience to learn the issue of\r\nthe battle, as may easily be imagined, considering the importance of the\r\nstake. When he heard that Aristodemus was come, his anxiety reached its\r\nhighest pitch. He could scarcely keep himself indoors, and sent\r\nmessenger after messenger, both servants and his own friends, to learn\r\nfrom Aristodemus what had taken place. Aristodemus returned no answer to\r\nany of them, but walked leisurely on with immovable countenance.\r\nAntigonus could bear the suspense no longer, but came to the door of his\r\npalace to meet Aristodemus, who was now accompanied by a large crowd.\r\nWhen he came near, he stretched forth his right hand, and in a loud\r\nvoice exclaimed, \"Hail, King Antigonus. We have defeated Ptolemy in a\r\nsea-fight. We are masters of Cyprus, and have taken sixteen thousand\r\neight hundred prisoners.\" To this Antigonus answered, \"Hail to you,\r\nalso; but you shall pay the penalty of having tortured us so long: you\r\nshall wait long before you receive the reward for your good news.\"\r\n\r\nXVIII. After this success, the people for the first time saluted\r\nAntigonus and Demetrius with the title of kings. The friends of\r\nAntigonus at once placed a diadem upon his head, and he sent one to\r\nDemetrius, with a letter in which he addressed him as king. The\r\nEgyptians, when they heard of this, also proclaimed Ptolemy king, that\r\nthey might not appear to be dispirited by their defeat. Their example\r\nwas soon followed by the other successors of Alexander, out of rivalry,\r\nfor Lysimachus and Seleukus now began to wear the diadem in the presence\r\nof Greeks, though Seleukus had long before adopted the royal style in\r\nhis dealings with Asiatics. Kassander, however, although every one both\r\nin interviews and letters addressed him as king, never used the title in\r\nhis own letters, but signed them simply with his own name as he had been\r\nwont to do.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of this title produced more important results than a mere\r\nempty change of name and style. It caused its bearers to be more exalted\r\nin their ideas, more extensive in their ambition, and more pompous and\r\nstately in their demeanour, just as actors when they put on royal robes\r\nadopt also the lofty port and the haughty voice and carriage of a king.\r\nThey also became more severe in their administration of justice, because\r\nthey now laid aside that dissimulation by which they had hitherto\r\nconcealed their power, and which had rendered them so much more lenient\r\nand gentle in their treatment of their subjects. So great was the power\r\nof the voice of one flatterer, and such great changes did it effect in\r\nthe entire world.\r\n\r\nXIX. Antigonus, elated by the successes of Demetrius at Cyprus, at once\r\nmarched to attack Ptolemy. He himself led the land force, while\r\nDemetrius accompanied him along the coast with an enormous fleet. But\r\nMedius, a friend of Antigonus, was warned in a dream of what was\r\ndestined to be the issue of the campaign. He dreamed that Antigonus with\r\nall his army was running a race in the circus. At first he appeared to\r\nbe running strongly and fast, but soon his strength seemed to be ebbing\r\naway, and at last when he turned round the extreme point of the course\r\nand began to return, he was so weak and out of breath that he could\r\nhardly recover himself.\r\n\r\nIndeed Antigonus by land met with many disasters, while Demetrius at sea\r\nmet with a terrible storm, and narrowly escaped being driven ashore upon\r\nan iron-bound coast. He lost many ships, and returned without having\r\naccomplished anything. Antigonus was now very near eighty years of age,\r\nand was incapacitated for active service by his size and unwieldiness\r\nrather than by his age. He consequently entrusted the management of the\r\nwar to Demetrius, who had already by his good fortune and skill\r\nconducted several most important campaigns with success.\r\n\r\nAntigonus was not alarmed at his amours, his extravagancies, or his\r\ncarousals, for he knew that, although in time of peace Demetrius used to\r\nindulge unrestrainedly in these pleasures, yet that in war he was as\r\nsober as though it were natural to him to be so. It is said that, in\r\nallusion to the empire which Lamia had now gained over Demetrius, once\r\nwhen he affectionately embraced his father on his return from a journey,\r\nAntigonus said, \"My boy, you seem to think that you are caressing\r\nLamia.\" Another time, when Demetrius spent several days in drinking, and\r\nexcused himself by saying that he had been laid up with a severe cold,\r\nAntigonus answered, \"So I understood, but was the cold Chian or\r\nThasian?\" Once Antigonus heard that Demetrius had a fever, and went to\r\nsee him. At the door he met one of his favourites coming out. He went\r\nin, sat down by his bedside, and took him by the hand. When Demetrius\r\nsaid that the fever had just left him, Antigonus answered, \"Yes, I met\r\nit just now at the door.\" So gently did he deal with the vices of\r\nDemetrius, because of his many other good qualities. The Scythians have\r\na custom of twanging their bows while they are drinking and carousing,\r\nas though to recall their courage while it is melting away in pleasure;\r\nbut Demetrius used to give up his whole thoughts at one time to\r\npleasure, and at another to serious work, concentrating his entire\r\nattention upon the matter in hand, so that his amusements never\r\ninterfered with his preparations for war.\r\n\r\nXX. He appears indeed to have been better able to make preparations for\r\nwar than to use them, for he always liked to be more than sufficiently\r\nprovided with stores of every kind, and always wished to construct\r\nlarger ships, and more powerful battering engines, in the working of\r\nwhich he took an especial delight. He was intelligent and clever, and\r\ndid not waste his mechanical ingenuity in mere pastime, like other\r\nprinces, who have amused themselves by playing on the flute, painting,\r\nor working in metal. Æropus, king of Macedonia, used to employ his\r\nleisure time in making little tables and lamps; while Attalus, surnamed\r\nPhilometor, amused himself by cultivating poisonous herbs, not merely\r\nhyoscyamus and hellebore, but even hemlock, aconite and dorycnium.[298]\r\nThese he used to plant and tend with his own hands in the royal gardens,\r\nand made it his business to know their various juices and fruit, and to\r\ngather it in due season. The kings of Parthia, too, used to pride\r\nthemselves upon sharpening the points of their own javelins. But the\r\nmechanics of Demetrius were always upon a royal scale, and his engines\r\nwere of enormous size, showing by their admirable and ingenious\r\nconstruction the grand ideas of their inventor; for they appeared worthy\r\nnot only of the genius and wealth, but of the hand of a king. Their size\r\nastonished his friends, while their beauty charmed even his enemies, and\r\nthis praise is far from being as exaggerated as it sounds; for his\r\nenemies actually stood in crowds along the sea-shore to admire his ships\r\nof fifteen and sixteen banks of oars, while his \"city-takers\"[299] were\r\nregarded as wonders even by the towns against which they were employed,\r\nas we may see in a notable example. Lysimachus, who of all the kings of\r\nhis time was the bitterest enemy of Demetrius, when he was endeavouring\r\nto force Demetrius to raise the siege of Soli in Cilicia, sent a message\r\nto him asking to be allowed to see his siege engines and his ships of\r\nwar. Demetrius indulged his curiosity, and after viewing them he retired\r\nhome. The Rhodians also, after they had stood a long siege, when they\r\ncame to terms with Demetrius, begged for some of his machines, which\r\nthey wished to keep both as a memorial of his power and of their own\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nXXI. Demetrius went to war with the Rhodians because they were the\r\nallies of Ptolemy, and brought up to their walls his largest\r\n\"city-taker,\" a machine with a square base, each side of which measured\r\neight-and-forty cubits at the bottom. It was sixty-six cubits in height,\r\nand its upper part was much narrower than the base. Within, it was\r\ndivided into many separate storeys and chambers, with windows on each\r\nstorey opening towards the enemy, through which missiles of every kind\r\ncould be shot, as it was full of soldiers armed with every kind of\r\nweapon. It never shook nor trembled, but rolled steadily onwards,\r\nupright and firm, with a regular, equable motion, which filled all\r\nspectators with terror and delight. Two steel corslets were brought from\r\nCyprus for Demetrius to use in this war, each of which weighed forty\r\nminæ.[300] The maker, Zoilus, in order to show their strength and power\r\nof resisting a blow, bade Demetrius shoot a dart out of a catapult at\r\none of them at a distance of twenty paces. Where it struck, the iron\r\nremained unbroken, and only showed a trifling scratch, such as might be\r\nmade by a stilus, or iron pen for writing on wax. This corslet Demetrius\r\nwore himself. He gave the other to Alkimus of Epirus, the bravest and\r\nmost warlike man in all his army, who wore a suit of armour weighing two\r\ntalents,[301] while that of all the rest weighed only one talent. This\r\nman fell during the siege of Rhodes, in a battle near the theatre.\r\n\r\nXXII. The Rhodians defended themselves with great spirit, and Demetrius\r\nwas unable to accomplish anything against them; but he still continued\r\nthe siege out of anger, because they had captured a ship in which his\r\nwife Phila had sent him letters, clothes and bedding, and had sent it at\r\nonce to Ptolemy, just as it was. In this they were far from imitating\r\nthe courtesy of the Athenians, who, when Philip was at war with them,\r\ncaptured a messenger and read all the letters which he carried except\r\none written by Olympias, which they did not open, but sent it on to him\r\nwith the seal unbroken. However, although Demetrius was much nettled by\r\nthe conduct of the Rhodians, he did not stoop to retaliation upon them,\r\nalthough he soon had an opportunity of doing so. Protogenes of Kaunus\r\nhappened at that time to be painting a picture of Ialysus[302] for the\r\nRhodians, and Demetrius found the picture very nearly completed in one\r\nof the suburbs of the city. The Rhodians sent a herald and begged him\r\nto spare the work, and not destroy it, to which he answered, that he\r\nwould rather burn his father's statues than such a precious work of art.\r\nApelles tells us that when he saw this picture, the sight at first took\r\naway his breath; and that at last he said, \"Indeed this is a wonderful\r\npiece of work, and must have cost great labour.\" Yet it has not that\r\ngrace which gives so divine a charm to the works of Apelles himself.\r\nThis picture shared the common lot of all Greek works of art, being\r\ntaken to Rome, where it was destroyed by fire. As the Rhodians gallantly\r\nheld their own in the war, Demetrius became weary of the siege, and\r\ngladly accepted the offer of the Athenians to act as mediators. They\r\nmade peace between them on condition that the Rhodians should act as the\r\nallies of Antigonus and Demetrius, except against Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nXXIII. The Athenians now invited Demetrius to come to their aid, as\r\nKassander was besieging Athens. Demetrius arrived with three hundred and\r\nthirty ships, and a large land force. He not only drove Kassander out of\r\nAttica, but pursued him as far as Thermopylæ, where he defeated him in a\r\nbattle, and gained possession of the city of Heraklea, which voluntarily\r\nsurrendered to him. A body of six thousand Macedonians also deserted\r\nfrom Kassander and joined him. On his return he freed the Greeks south\r\nof Thermopylæ from Macedonian domination, formed an alliance with the\r\nBoeotians and took Kenchreæ. He destroyed the forts at Phyle and\r\nPanaktum in Attica, which had been garrisoned by Kassander's troops, and\r\nrestored them to the Athenians. They, although they appeared to have\r\nexhausted every possible form of adulation during his former visit, yet\r\ncontrived to flatter him by the invention of fresh honours. They\r\nassigned the interior of the Parthenon to him for his lodging; and there\r\nhe dwelt with the title of \"the guest of Athena,\" though he was a very\r\nill-behaved guest to be quartered in the house of a virgin goddess. Yet\r\nonce, when his father heard that his brother Philip was staying in a\r\nhouse where there were three young women, he said nothing to Philip, but\r\nin his presence sent for the quartermaster and said to him, \"Will you\r\nbe so good as to find some less crowded quarters for my son.\"\r\n\r\nXXIV. Demetrius, however, without paying the least respect to Athena,\r\nalthough he was wont to call her his elder sister, filled the Acropolis\r\nwith such a series of outrages on well-born youths and women of the\r\nupper classes that the place became comparatively decent when he\r\ncontented himself with holding an orgie in the society of the celebrated\r\ncourtesans, Chrysis, Lamia, Demo and Antikyra. For the sake of the city\r\nI will say no more about his other debaucheries, but I cannot refrain\r\nfrom mentioning the virtue and chastity shown by Demokles. He was very\r\nyoung, and his beauty did not escape the notice of Demetrius; indeed his\r\nnickname betrayed him, for he was always spoken of as Demokles the\r\nHandsome. He turned a deaf ear to all advances, presents, or threats,\r\nand at last ceased to frequent the gymnasium and the palæstra, and used\r\nonly a private bath. Demetrius watched his opportunity, and surprised\r\nhim there alone. The boy, when he saw that he was caught where no one\r\ncould help him, rather than suffer violence, took off the lid of the\r\ncopper, leaped into the boiling water, and destroyed himself. He\r\ndeserved a better fate, but the spirit which prompted the act was worthy\r\nof his country and of his beauty, and was very different to that of\r\nKleaenetus the son of Kleomedon, who, when his father was condemned to\r\npay a fine of fifty talents, obtained a remission of it from Demetrius,\r\nand showed a letter from Demetrius to the Athenian people signifying his\r\npleasure in the matter; by which conduct Kleaenetus not only disgraced\r\nhimself, but threw the whole city into a ferment. Kleomedon's fine was\r\nremitted, but the people decreed that no citizen should ever again bring\r\nthem a letter from Demetrius. However, as Demetrius was greatly incensed\r\nat this, and did not conceal his displeasure, the Athenians in terror\r\nnot only reversed the decree, but put to death some of those who had\r\nadvocated it, and banished others. Moreover, they actually decreed that\r\n\"the entire people of Athens should regard anything which King Demetrius\r\nmight be pleased to command as both righteous in respect of the gods,\r\nand legal as regards men.\" When one of the better class of citizens\r\nobserved that Stratokles must be mad to propose such a decree,\r\nDemochares[303] of Leukonoe answered \"He would be mad not to be\r\nmad,\"[304] for Stratokles made a great fortune by his flattery of\r\nDemetrius. This speech was reported to Stratokles, and Demochares was\r\nforced to go into exile. Such was the conduct of the Athenians when they\r\nwere relieved of their Macedonian garrison and were thought to have\r\nbecome a free people.\r\n\r\nXXV. Demetrius now proceeded to Peloponnesus, where he met with no\r\nresistance, as the enemy fled before him, and surrendered their cities\r\nto him. He made himself master of the district known as Akte, and of the\r\nwhole of Arcadia, except Mantinea, while he set free Argos, Sikyon and\r\nCorinth, by bribing their garrisons to evacuate them with a hundred\r\ntalents. At Argos he acted as president of the games at the festival of\r\nHera, which took place whilst he was there. On this occasion he held a\r\nsolemn assembly of all the Greeks, and publicly married Deidameia, a\r\ndaughter of Æakides, king of the Molossi, and sister of Pyrrhus. He\r\nremarked to the people of Sikyon that they lived out of their proper\r\ncity, and prevailed upon them to remove to the spot which they now\r\ninhabit. He changed the name as well as the situation of the city, and\r\ninstead of Sikyon named it Demetrias.\r\n\r\nAt a largely attended meeting held at the Isthmus, Demetrius was\r\nproclaimed chief of Greece, as Philip and Alexander had been in former\r\ndays; though Demetrius considered himself to be not a little superior to\r\neither of them, being elated by his good fortune and the immense force\r\nat his disposal. Alexander never deprived a king of his title, nor did\r\nhe ever call himself king of kings, though he raised many to the dignity\r\nand style of kings; but Demetrius scoffed at those who called any one\r\nking, except himself and his father, and was much pleased at his\r\ncarousals to hear toasts drunk to the health of Demetrius the King,\r\nSeleukus the Commander of the Elephants, Ptolemy the Admiral,\r\nLysimachus the Treasurer, and Agathokles of Sicily the Lord of the\r\nIsles. The other princes laughed at these sallies of Demetrius, and only\r\nLysimachus was angry that Demetrius should think him a eunuch; for it\r\nwas a pretty general custom to appoint eunuchs to the post of treasurer.\r\nIndeed Lysimachus hated him more bitterly than all of the rest, and,\r\nsneering at his passion for Lamia, used to declare that he had never\r\nbefore seen a whore act in a tragedy: to which Demetrius retorted that\r\nhis whore was a more respectable woman than Lysimachus's Penelope.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Demetrius now set out for Athens, and sent a letter to the\r\nAthenians informing them that he desired to be initiated, and that he\r\nwished to go through the whole course, including both the lesser and the\r\ngreater mysteries. This is not lawful, and never took place before, as\r\nthe minor initiation used to take place in the month Anthesterion, and\r\nthe greater in Boedromion. When the letter was read, no one ventured to\r\noffer any opposition except Pythodorus the torchbearer,[305] and he\r\neffected nothing; for, at the instance of Stratokles, the Athenians\r\ndecreed that the month Munychion should be called Anthesterion, and in\r\nit celebrated the mysteries of Demeter which are held at Agræ.[306]\r\nAfter this the name of the month Munychion was changed again from\r\nAnthesterion to Boedromion, and Demetrius was admitted to the second\r\ndegree, and allowed the privileges of an \"epoptes.\" In allusion to this\r\nPhilippides rails at Stratokles in his verses as the man\r\n\r\n   \"Who crowds into one month the entire year.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in allusion to the lodging of Demetrius in the Parthenon, he wrote\r\n\r\n   \"Who treats Acropolis as t'were an inn\r\n    And makes the Virgin's shrine a house of sin.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. But of all the outrages and illegal acts of which Demetrius was\r\nguilty at this period, nothing seems to have enraged the Athenians so\r\nmuch as his ordering them speedily to levy a sum of two hundred and\r\nfifty talents, which, when it had been raised by a most harsh and\r\npitiless series of exactions, was publicly presented by Demetrius to\r\nLamia and her sisterhood to furnish their toilet-tables. It was the\r\ndisgrace of the whole business and the scorn which it brought upon them,\r\nwhich stung them to the quick, more than the loss of the money. Some\r\nwriters say that it was the people of Thessaly, not the Athenians, whom\r\nhe treated in this manner. However, besides this, Lamia extorted money\r\nfrom many citizens on pretence of providing a supper for the king. This\r\nsupper was so famous on account of the enormous sum which it cost, that\r\na history of it was written by Lynkeus of Samos. For this reason one of\r\nthe comic poets very cleverly called Lamia a \"city-taker.\" Demochares of\r\nSoli called Demetrius himself \"Mythus,\" or \"Fable,\" because he too had\r\nhis Lamia.[307]\r\n\r\nIndeed the passion of Demetrius for Lamia caused not only his wives but\r\nhis friends to dislike her and be jealous of her. Some of them went on\r\nan embassy to Lysimachus, and he when at leisure showed them on his\r\nthighs and arms the scars of deep wounds caused by a lion's claws,\r\ntelling them of how King Alexander had fastened him in the same cage\r\nwith the beast, and the battle he had fought with it. On hearing this\r\nthey laughingly said that their master also frequently showed upon his\r\nneck the marks of a savage beast called Lamia, which he kept. The wonder\r\nwas that Demetrius, who had objected to Phila as being past her first\r\nyouth, should yet be so captivated by Lamia, who was now far advanced in\r\nyears. Once when Lamia was playing on the flute at a banquet, Demetrius\r\nasked the courtesan Demo, who was surnamed Mania, what she thought of\r\nher. \"I think her an old woman, my king,\" replied she. Again when the\r\nsweetmeats were placed on the table, Demetrius said to Demo, \"Do you see\r\nwhat fine things Lamia sends me?\" \"My mother,\" answered Demo, \"will send\r\nyou many more if only you will sleep with her.\" A saying of Lamia's\r\nabout the well-known judgment of Bocchoris has been recorded. A certain\r\nEgyptian became enamoured of the courtesan Thonis, but she set too high\r\na price upon her favours for him. Afterwards he dreamed that he had\r\nenjoyed her, and his passion for her cooled. Upon this Thonis sued him\r\nin court for the money, and Bocchoris, having heard the case argued,\r\nordered the man to place the exact sum which she demanded in a glass\r\nvessel, and to wave it backwards and forwards while she clutched at the\r\nshadow, because the young man's dream had been a shadow of the\r\nreality.[308] Lamia said that she did not think this decision a just\r\none, because the woman's desire for the gold was not satisfied by the\r\nshadow, as the young man's passion had been by his dream.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. But now the fortunes and deeds of the subject of our narrative\r\nforce us to pass from a comic to a tragic scene, for all the other kings\r\nconspired against Antigonus, and united their forces together. Demetrius\r\nhereupon sailed away from Greece and joined his father, who was making\r\nwonderful exertions for a man of his age, and who was greatly encouraged\r\nby his son's arrival. Yet it appears as though Antigonus, if only he\r\nwould have made some small concessions and restrained his excessive love\r\nof power, might have enjoyed his supreme dignity to the end of his life,\r\nand might have bequeathed to his son his position of chief of all the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander. Being, however, by nature haughty and\r\ndisdainful, and even harsher in word than in deed, he alienated from\r\nhimself and exasperated many young and powerful men; and even now he\r\nboasted that he would scatter the confederacy by which he was menaced as\r\neasily as a man scares a flock of birds away from a field. He took the\r\nfield with more than seventy thousand infantry, ten thousand cavalry,\r\nand seventy-five elephants, while his enemies' army numbered sixty-four\r\nthousand infantry, five hundred more cavalry than his own, four hundred\r\nelephants, and one hundred and twenty war-chariots. When they drew near\r\nhe became less hopeful rather than less determined. He was always wont\r\nto show a lofty and boastful spirit in the hour of danger, speaking in a\r\nloud tone, using confident language, and after making some jest when in\r\nthe presence of the enemy, to show his own assurance of success and\r\ncontempt for his opponents. Now, however, he was thoughtful and silent,\r\nand presented his son to the army as his successor. But what astonished\r\nevery one most of all was that he held council with Demetrius alone in\r\nthe tent, although he never before had shared his secret thoughts even\r\nwith his son, but had always privately formed his own plans, and\r\npublicly carried them out on his own responsibility. It is said that\r\nDemetrius, when still very young, once asked him at what hour he\r\nproposed to march, to which Antigonus angrily answered, \"Do you fear,\r\nthat you alone will not hear the sound of the trumpet?\"\r\n\r\nXXIX. On this occasion it appears that they were also disheartened by\r\nsinister omens. Demetrius dreamed that Alexander appeared before him in\r\nshining armour, and inquired what would be their watchword for the\r\nbattle. When Demetrius answered \"Zeus and victory,\" Alexander replied,\r\n\"I will go away now, and tell this to the enemy; for I am going over to\r\nthem.\" Antigonus, too, as he stepped out of his tent to see his line\r\nformed stumbled and fell heavily upon his face. When he rose, he lifted\r\nhis hands to heaven and prayed to the gods that they would either grant\r\nhim victory or a painless death before his army was routed.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle began, Demetrius with the flower of the cavalry charged\r\nAntiochus the son of Seleukus, and brilliantly routed the enemy, but he\r\nlost the day by his headstrong eagerness to pursue too far. He was\r\nunable to rejoin the infantry, for the enemy's elephants interposed\r\nbetween him and the phalanx, which was thus left without any cavalry to\r\ncover its flanks. Seeing this, Seleukus kept the rest of his cavalry\r\never threatening to charge, but never actually doing so, hovering near\r\nthe phalanx and both terrifying it and giving the men an opportunity of\r\nchanging sides, which indeed took place; for a great mass of Antigonus's\r\ninfantry came over to Seleukus, and the rest fled. Many enemies now\r\nbeset Antigonus, and one of his attendants said to him, \"My king, it is\r\nyou whom they are making for.\" \"Why,\" replied he, \"what other mark\r\ncould they have but me? But Demetrius will soon be here to the rescue.\"\r\nWhile he looked round hoping in vain to see his son, a shower of darts\r\nfell, and laid him low. All his friends and attendants now fled, except\r\none named Thorax, a native of Larissa, who remained by the corpse.\r\n\r\nXXX. After this battle the victorious kings proceeded to divide the\r\nempire of Antigonus and Demetrius amongst them, each annexing the\r\nportion which lay nearest to his own dominions, as though they were\r\ncutting slices out of some huge slaughtered beast. Demetrius fled with\r\nfive thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry, and directed his march\r\nwith the utmost speed towards Ephesus. All imagined that in his distress\r\nfor money he would not spare the rich temple there, and he himself,\r\nfearing lest his soldiers should do so, set sail as quickly as possible\r\nfor Greece, as his chief hopes now lay in Athens. Indeed he had left\r\nthere a part of his fleet, some treasure and his wife Deidameia, and\r\nimagined that he could find no surer refuge in his adversity than\r\nAthens, where he felt assured of the loyalty of the people. But while he\r\nwas passing the Cyclades he met an embassy from Athens begging him not\r\nto approach that city, since the people had decreed that none of the\r\nkings should be admitted within its walls. The ambassadors added that\r\nhis wife Deidameia had been escorted with due honour and respect to\r\nMegara. On hearing this, Demetrius, who had borne the rest of his\r\nmisfortunes with the utmost serenity, and had never hitherto allowed an\r\nunworthy expression to escape him, became transported with anger. He\r\nwas, in truth, bitterly grieved at being thus unexpectedly betrayed by\r\nthe Athenians, and at finding that their apparent enthusiasm in his\r\ncause had all the while been unreal and fictitious. Apparently the\r\nbestowal of excessive honours upon kings and potentates by the people is\r\nbut a poor test of their real loyalty, for the essence of these honours\r\nlies in their being freely offered, and they are worthless if prompted\r\nby fear; and men fawn upon those they fear just as they do upon those\r\nwhom they really love. For this reason sensible men know how to value\r\nthe erection of their statues, flattering decrees, and other public\r\nhonours, by reflecting upon what they themselves have done for their\r\nadmirers; for by this means they can discern whether these are really\r\ngenuine expressions of respect, or are extorted by terror; for peoples\r\nfrequently confer these very distinctions upon men whom they hate and\r\nabhor, but whom they are forced to honour against their will.\r\n\r\nXXXI. Demetrius, although he considered that he had been very badly\r\ntreated by the Athenians, was powerless to resent their conduct. He sent\r\nan embassy to Athens, gently complaining of their conduct, and\r\nrequesting that they would restore his ships, one of which was a vessel\r\nof thirteen banks of oars. Having received them he coasted along as far\r\nas the Isthmus, where he found that all his garrisons had been driven\r\nout of the cities, and that the whole country had gone over to his\r\nenemies. He now left Pyrrhus to act as his lieutenant in Greece, and\r\nhimself sailed to the Chersonese.[309] Here he enriched his troops at\r\nthe expense of Lysimachus by plundering the country, and soon found\r\nmeans again to collect a very considerable army. The other kings paid no\r\nregard to Lysimachus, thinking that he was no better a man than\r\nDemetrius, and more to be feared because he was more powerful.\r\n\r\nNot long after this Seleukus sent an embassy to Demetrius to make\r\nproposals for the hand of Stratonike, the daughter of Demetrius by his\r\nwife Phila. Seleukus already had one son named Antiochus by his wife\r\nApama, a Persian lady, but he thought that his empire would suffice for\r\nmore than one heir, and he desired to form an alliance with Demetrius,\r\nbecause Lysimachus had recently married one of Ptolemy's daughters\r\nhimself, and taken the other for his son Agathokles. To Demetrius this\r\noffer of marriage from Seleukus was a most unexpected piece of good\r\nfortune. He placed his daughter on board ship, and sailed with his\r\nentire fleet to Syria. On his way he was forced to land several times to\r\nobtain supplies, especially on the coast of Cilicia, which province,\r\nafter the battle in which Antigonus fell, had been bestowed upon\r\nPleistarchus, the brother of Kassander. Pleistarchus took umbrage at the\r\nintrusion of Demetrius into his territory, and retired to Macedonia to\r\ncomplain to his brother that Seleukus was betraying the other kings by\r\nmaking terms with the common enemy of them all.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Demetrius, when he discovered the intentions of Pleistarchus,\r\nproceeded at once to Quinda, where he found the sum of twelve hundred\r\ntalents still remaining. Having made himself master of this, he quickly\r\nreembarked and put to sea. He was now joined by his wife Phila, and met\r\nSeleukus at Rhossas. Here the two princes conversed together in a truly\r\nroyal style, without the least suspicion or fear of treachery. First\r\nSeleukus feasted Demetrius in his tent in the midst of his camp, and\r\nafterwards Demetrius entertained him at a banquet on board his great\r\nthirteen-banked ship. They also talked freely together for a long time,\r\nspending several days in friendly intercourse without any bodyguard or\r\narms, till at length Seleukus took Stratonike, and escorted her with\r\ngreat pomp to Antiocheia.[310] Demetrius now made himself master of\r\nCilicia, and sent his wife Phila to her brother, Kassander, to answer\r\nthe accusations brought against him by Pleistarchus. During this time\r\nDeidameia sailed from Greece and joined Demetrius, but not long after\r\nher arrival she sickened and died. By the good offices of Seleukus,\r\nDemetrius was now reconciled with Ptolemy, and arranged to take\r\nPtolemäis, Ptolemy's daughter, for his wife. So far Seleukus behaved\r\nvery well; but he could not prevail upon Demetrius to give up Cilicia to\r\nhim for a sum of money, and when he angrily demanded the surrender of\r\nTyre and Sidon, his conduct appears very overbearing and ungenerous, as\r\nthough he, who had made himself master of all the country between the\r\nRed Sea and the Mediterranean, were so poor and needy as to be obliged\r\nto squabble with his father-in-law about two cities, at a time, too,\r\nwhen the latter was suffering from a great reverse of fortune. How\r\nstrongly does this bear out the truth of Plato's maxim, that he who\r\nwishes to be really rich ought to lessen his desires rather than\r\nincrease his property, because if a man places no bounds to his\r\ncovetousness, he never will be free from want and misery.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Demetrius on this occasion showed no want of spirit. He declared\r\nthat not if he had lost ten thousand fields like Ipsus would he consent\r\nto buy Seleukus for his son-in-law. He strengthened the garrisons of the\r\ncities,[311] and hearing that Lachares, taking advantage of the factions\r\ninto which the Athenians were divided, had made himself despot of that\r\ncity, he thought that if he only were to show himself before Athens he\r\nmight easily obtain possession of it. He crossed the sea in safety with\r\na large fleet, but when off the coast of Attica he encountered a violent\r\nstorm, in which he lost most of his ships and a great number of his men.\r\nHe himself escaped unhurt, and at once began to make war against the\r\nAthenians. As, however, he could not effect anything, he sent his\r\nlieutenants to collect another fleet, and meanwhile proceeded to\r\nPeloponnesus. Here he laid siege to Messene, and during an assault\r\nnearly lost his life, for he was struck full in the face by a dart from\r\na catapult, which pierced through his jaw into his mouth. He recovered\r\nfrom his wound, received the submission of several insurgent cities, and\r\nreturned to Attica, where he made himself master of Eleusis and Rhamnus,\r\nand ravaged the country. He captured a ship loaded with wheat bound for\r\nAthens, and hanged the captain and pilot, which measure terrified the\r\nother merchants so much that they avoided Athens, and a terrible famine\r\ntook place there, and the want of food brought about a scarcity of\r\neverything else. A medimnus[312] of salt was sold for forty drachmas,\r\nand a modius[313] of corn sold for three hundred drachmas.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians gained a short respite from their sufferings by the\r\nappearance near Ægina of a fleet of a hundred and fifty sail, which was\r\nsent by Ptolemy to aid them. Soon, however, Demetrius collected from\r\nPeloponnesus and Cyprus a fleet of three hundred ships, before which\r\nthose of Ptolemy were forced to retire. Upon this the despot Lachares\r\nmade his escape and abandoned the city to its fate.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. The Athenians, although they had decreed that anyone who proposed\r\nto make peace and come to terms with Demetrius should be put to death,\r\nnow at once opened their nearest gates and sent an embassy to him; not\r\nthat they expected to be well treated by him, but acting under the\r\npressure of starvation. It was said that, among other painful incidents,\r\nit happened that a father and a son were sitting in the same room,\r\nwithout any hopes of surviving, when a dead mouse fell from the roof,\r\nupon which they both started up and began to fight for it. We are told\r\nthat during this time the philosopher Epikurus kept his disciples alive\r\nby counting out to them a fixed allowance of beans every day. This was\r\nthe condition of the city when Demetrius made his entry into it. He\r\nordered all the Athenians to assemble in the theatre, occupied the stage\r\nwith armed men, placing his own bodyguard round the part usually\r\nreserved for the actors, and made his appearance, like a tragic actor,\r\nthrough the entrance at the back.[314] The Athenians were greatly\r\nterrified at these proceedings, but the first words of his address put\r\nan end to their fears. He spoke in a mild and conciliatory tone, briefly\r\nand gently, complained of their conduct towards him, and announced his\r\nforgiveness of them. He distributed among them one hundred thousand\r\nmedimni of wheat, and appointed the most popular men in the city to the\r\nvacant magistracies. Dromokleides the orator, seeing that the people\r\ncould scarcely find enough means to express their delight, and that they\r\nwere eager to outdo the panegyrics which were being lavished upon\r\nDemetrius from the bema, proposed that the ports of Peiræus and Munychia\r\nshould be handed over to King Demetrius. When this was agreed to,\r\nDemetrius himself placed a garrison in the Museum, by which he intended\r\nto curb the people in case they should grow restive and take off his\r\nattention from his other enterprises.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Being now master of Athens, Demetrius at once began to attack\r\nLacedæmon. He met the King of Sparta, Archidamus, near Mantinea,\r\ndefeated him, and invaded Laconia, driving the beaten army before him.\r\nHe fought a second battle before the walls of Sparta itself, in which\r\nhe killed two hundred Spartans, and took five hundred prisoners; and he\r\nvery nearly took the city itself, which up to that time had never been\r\ntaken. Fortune, however, seems to have introduced greater and more\r\nsudden vicissitudes into the life of Demetrius than into that of any\r\nother prince, for he was constantly rising from the most abject poverty\r\nto the highest pinnacles of wealth and power, and then being as suddenly\r\ncast down again. He himself is said, when his fortunes were at their\r\nlowest, to have quoted the verse of Æschylus,\r\n\r\n   \"Thou raisest up, and thou dost bring me down.\"\r\n\r\nSo at this time, when everything seemed to be succeeding, and his empire\r\nand power constantly increasing, Demetrius received the news that\r\nLysimachus had taken all the cities in Asia which had belonged to him,\r\nand that Ptolemy had made himself master of Cyprus with the exception of\r\nSalamis, which he was besieging, in which city was the mother and the\r\nchildren of Demetrius. Yet, like the woman spoken of by the poet\r\nArchilochus, who deceitfully offers water in one hand, while she holds a\r\nfirebrand in the other, the fortune of Demetrius, after soaring him away\r\nfrom the conquest of Sparta by these terrifying pieces of intelligence,\r\nat once offered him hopes of accomplishing a new and mighty enterprise,\r\nin the following manner.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. After the death of Kassander, his eldest son Philip ascended the\r\nthrone, but not long afterwards died. Upon this Kassander's two younger\r\nsons each aspired to the crown. One of them, Antipater, murdered his\r\nmother Thessalonike, upon which the other[315] invited Pyrrhus to come\r\nfrom Epirus, and Demetrius from Peloponnesus, to support his claims.\r\nPyrrhus was the first to arrive, and demanded so large a portion of the\r\nkingdom of Macedonia as the price of his assistance, that he soon became\r\nan object of terror to Alexander. When Demetrius, in answer to the\r\nappeal of Alexander, arrived with his army, Alexander was even more\r\nterrified, because of his great renown. He met Demetrius near Dium, and\r\nwelcomed him as an honoured guest, but gave him to understand that he no\r\nlonger stood in need of his services. Upon this each began to suspect\r\nthe other, and Demetrius, when he was proceeding to a banquet to which\r\nhe had been invited by the young prince, was warned that his host\r\nintended to assassinate him while they were drinking after dinner.\r\nDemetrius was not in the least disturbed at this intelligence, but\r\nmerely delayed going to the banquet for a short time, while he ordered\r\nhis officers to keep their men under arms, and bade his personal\r\nfollowers and pages, who far out-numbered the retinue of Alexander, to\r\nenter the banqueting hall with him, and to remain there until he left\r\nthe table. Alarmed by these precautions, Alexander did not venture to\r\noffer him any violence; and Demetrius soon left the room, excusing\r\nhimself on the ground that his health would not permit him to drink\r\nwine. On the following day Demetrius made preparations for departure,\r\nannouncing that he had received news which made this necessary. He\r\nbegged Alexander to pardon him for so sudden a retreat, and promised\r\nthat when he was more at leisure he would pay him another visit.\r\nAlexander was delighted at this, thinking that Demetrius was leaving the\r\ncountry of his own free-will, and not as an enemy; and he escorted him\r\nas far as the borders of Thessaly. When they reached Larissa, each again\r\ninvited the other to a banquet, each intending to murder the other. This\r\ndecided the fall of Alexander, who fell into his own trap, being loth to\r\nshow any distrust of Demetrius, lest Demetrius should distrust him. He\r\naccepted Demetrius's invitation to a banquet, during which Demetrius\r\nsuddenly rose. Alexander in alarm also started to his feet, and followed\r\nDemetrius towards the door. Demetrius as he passed the door said to his\r\nbodyguard, \"Kill the man who follows me,\" and walked on. Alexander, who\r\nfollowed him, was cut down by the guard, as were his friends, who rushed\r\nto his assistance. One of these men when dying is said to have remarked\r\nthat Demetrius had got the start of them by one day.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. The night was spent in tumult and alarm. At daybreak the\r\nMacedonians, who had feared an attack from the army of Demetrius, became\r\nreassured, as nothing of the kind took place; and when Demetrius\r\nintimated to them his wish to address them and to explain his conduct,\r\nthey received him in a friendly manner. When he appeared, he had no need\r\nto make a long speech, for the Macedonians, who hated Antipater for\r\nhaving murdered his mother, and who knew not where to look for a better\r\nsovereign, saluted Demetrius as King of the Macedonians, and at once\r\nconducted him into Macedonia. The new reign was not displeasing to the\r\nremainder of the Macedonians, who had never forgotten the disgraceful\r\nconduct of Kassander after the death of Alexander. If any remembrance of\r\nthe moderation of their old governor Antipater still remained amongst\r\nthem, Demetrius reaped the benefit of it, as his wife Phila was the\r\ndaughter of Antipater, and his son,[316] by her, who was nearly grown\r\nup, and accompanied his father on this campaign, was now the heir to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. After this brilliant piece of good fortune, Demetrius received\r\nthe news that his mother and children had been set at liberty by\r\nPtolemy, who had given them presents and treated them with respect;\r\nwhile he also heard that his daughter, who had been given in marriage to\r\nSeleukus, was living with his son Antiochus, with the title of \"queen of\r\nthe native tribes of the interior.\" It appears that Antiochus fell\r\nviolently in love with Stratonike, who was quite a young girl, though\r\nshe had already borne a child to Seleukus. After making many fruitless\r\nefforts to resist his passion, he reflected upon the wickedness of\r\nindulging a love which he was unable to restrain, and decided that he\r\nwould put an end to his life. Under pretence of illness he refused to\r\ntake nourishment, neglected his person, and was quietly sinking.\r\nErasistratus, his physician, had without much difficulty perceived that\r\nhe was in love, but could not guess with whom. He consequently spent the\r\nentire day in the same room with Antiochus, and whenever any young\r\npersons came to visit him, narrowly watched his countenance and those\r\nparts by which emotion is especially betrayed. He found that his\r\ncondition was unaltered except when Stratonike came to see him, either\r\nalone or with her husband, Seleukus, and that then all the symptoms\r\nmentioned by Sappho were visible in him, such as stammering, fiery\r\nblushes, failure of eyesight, violent perspiration, disturbed and\r\nquickened pulse, and at length, as his passions gained the mastery over\r\nhim, pallor and bewilderment. Erasistratus, after making these\r\nobservations, reflected that it was not probable that the king's son\r\nwould starve himself to death in silence for love of any other woman\r\nthan his mother-in-law. He judged it to be a perilous enterprise to\r\nexplain the real state of the case, but, nevertheless, trusting to the\r\nlove of Seleukus for his son, he one day ventured to tell him that love\r\nwas really the disorder from which young Antiochus was suffering, and\r\nthat it was a hopeless and incurable passion. \"How incurable?\" inquired\r\nSeleukus. \"Because,\" answered Erasistratus, \"he is in love with my\r\nwife.\" \"Well, then,\" said Seleukus, \"will you not give her up,\r\nErasistratus, and marry her to my son, who is your friend, especially as\r\nthat is the only way out of this trouble for us?\" \"No,\" said\r\nErasistratus, \"I will not. Why, you yourself, although you are his\r\nfather, would not do this, if Antiochus were enamoured of Stratonike.\"\r\nTo this Seleukus replied, \"My friend, I would that by any means, human\r\nor divine, his passion could be directed to her; for I would willingly\r\neven give up my crown if I could thereby save Antiochus.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Seleukus, in a tone of deep feeling and with tears in his eyes,\r\nmade this avowal, Erasistratus took him by the hand, in token of good\r\nfaith, and declared that his own services were quite useless, for that\r\nSeleukus himself was best able to heal the disorders which had arisen in\r\nhis household. After this Seleukus convoked a general assembly of his\r\npeople, and declared to them that he had determined to nominate\r\nAntiochus king, and Stratonike queen of all the nations of the interior,\r\nand that they were to be married. He believed, he said, that his son,\r\nwho had always been accustomed to obey him, would raise no objection to\r\nthe marriage; and that if his wife was discontented with it on the\r\nground of its illegality, he begged his friends to argue with her and\r\npersuade her to regard everything as legal and honourable which the king\r\ndecided upon as expedient. In this manner it is said to have come to\r\npass that Antiochus was married to Stratonike.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. After obtaining Macedonia, Demetrius made himself master of\r\nThessaly also. As he possessed the greater part of Peloponnesus, besides\r\nMegara and Athens, he now marched against Boeotia. At first the Boeotians\r\ncame to terms, and formed an alliance with him, but afterwards, when\r\nKleonymus of Sparta came to Thebes with an army, and Pisis, the most\r\ninfluential citizen of Thespiæ, encouraged them to recover their\r\nliberty, they revolted from Demetrius. Upon this, Demetrius brought up\r\nhis famous siege train to attack their cities.[317] Kleonymus was so\r\nterrified that he secretly withdrew, and the Boeotians were scared into\r\nsubmission. Demetrius, though he garrisoned all their cities with his\r\nown troops, levied a large sum of money, and left Hieronymus[318] the\r\nhistorian as governor of the province, was thought to have dealt very\r\nmildly with the Boeotians, especially because of his treatment of Pisis;\r\nfor he not only dismissed him unharmed when brought before him as a\r\nprisoner, but conversed with him in a friendly manner, and nominated him\r\npolemarch of Thespiæ.\r\n\r\nNot long after these events, Lysimachus was taken prisoner by\r\nDromichætus. Upon this, Demetrius at once hurriedly marched towards\r\nThrace, hoping to find it unguarded. The Boeotians seized the opportunity\r\nof his absence to revolt, while news was brought to Demetrius that\r\nLysimachus had been dismissed by his captors. Enraged at this, he\r\nspeedily returned, and finding that the Boeotians had been defeated in a\r\npitched battle by his son Antigonus, he a second time laid siege to\r\nThebes.\r\n\r\nXL. However, as Pyrrhus was now overrunning Thessaly, and had pushed\r\neven as far as Thermopylæ, Demetrius left Antigonus to prosecute the\r\nsiege, and himself marched to attack Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus beat a hasty\r\nretreat, and Demetrius, leaving ten thousand infantry and a thousand\r\ncavalry in Thessaly, returned to press the siege of Thebes. He now\r\nbrought up his great machine, called the \"City-taker,\" which was moved\r\nby levers with great difficulty on account of its enormous weight; so\r\nthat it is said that in two months it hardly moved two furlongs, The\r\nBoeotians made a vigorous defence, and Demetrius frequently forced his\r\nsoldiers to engage in battle with them, more out of arrogance than\r\nthrough any real necessity for fighting. After one of these battles,\r\nAntigonus, grieved at the number of men who had fallen, said, \"My\r\nfather, why do we allow all these men to perish, when there is no\r\noccasion for it?\" Demetrius sharply answered, \"Why do you take offence\r\nat this? Do you have to pay the dead?\" Yet Demetrius, not wishing it to\r\nbe thought that he was lavish of other men's blood and not of his own,\r\nbut being anxious to fight among the foremost, was wounded by a dart\r\nthrown from a catapult, which pierced through his neck. He suffered much\r\nfrom this wound, but still continued the siege, and at length took\r\nThebes for the second time. When he entered the city, he inspired the\r\ncitizens with the most intense terror, as they expected to be treated\r\nwith the greatest severity. He was satisfied, however, with putting to\r\ndeath thirteen of the citizens, and banishing a few others. Thus was\r\nThebes taken twice within less than ten years since it was first\r\nrebuilt.\r\n\r\nAs the time for the Pythian games had now come round, Demetrius took\r\nupon himself to make a most startling innovation. As the passes leading\r\nto Delphi were held by the Ætolians, he celebrated the games in Athens,\r\ndeclaring that it was right that especial honour should be paid there to\r\nApollo, who is the tutelary god of the Athenians, and is said to have\r\nbeen the founder of their race.\r\n\r\nXLI. Demetrius now returned to Macedonia. As he could not bear a life of\r\nrepose, and found that his subjects were more easily governed on a\r\ncampaign, since they were troublesome and turbulent when at home, he\r\nmarched against the Ætolians. After laying waste their country he left\r\nPantauchus there with a large portion of his army, and with the rest\r\nmarched to attack Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus was equally eager to meet him, but\r\nthey missed each other, so that Demetrius invaded and ravaged Epirus,\r\nwhile Pyrrhus[319] fell in with Pantauchus and fought with him. He\r\nhimself exchanged blows with Pantauchus and put him to flight, killing\r\nmany of his followers, and taking five thousand prisoners. This did more\r\ndamage to the cause of Demetrius than anything else; for Pyrrhus was not\r\nso much disliked for the harm which he had done them, as he was admired\r\nfor his personal prowess. His fame became great in Macedonia after this\r\nbattle, and many Macedonians were heard to say that he alone, of all the\r\nprinces of the time, revived the image of Alexander's daring courage,\r\nwhile the rest, and especially Demetrius, only imitated his demeanour by\r\ntheir theatrical pomp and trappings of royalty. Indeed, Demetrius gave\r\nhimself the most extravagant airs, wearing magnificent purple robes and\r\nhats with a double crown, and even wore shoes of purple felt embroidered\r\nwith gold. There was a cloak which was for a long time being embroidered\r\nfor his use, a most extravagantly showy piece of work, upon which was\r\ndepicted a figure of the world and of the heavenly bodies. This cloak\r\nwas left unfinished when Demetrius lost his crown, and none of his\r\nsuccessors on the throne of Macedonia ever presumed to wear it, although\r\nsome of them were very ostentatious princes.\r\n\r\nXLII. The spectacle of this unusual pomp irritated the Macedonians, who\r\nwere not accustomed to see their kings thus attired, while the luxury\r\nand extravagance of Demetrius's mode of life also gave offence to them.\r\nThey were especially enraged at his haughty reserve, and the difficulty\r\nof obtaining access to him; for he either refused to grant an interview,\r\nor else treated those who were admitted to his presence with harshness\r\nand insolence. He kept an embassy of the Athenians, whom he respected\r\nbeyond all other Greeks, waiting for two years for an audience; and when\r\none ambassador arrived from Lacedæmon, he construed it as a mark of\r\ndisrespect, and was angry. But when Demetrius said to the\r\nambassador:--\"What is this that you tell me? the Lacedæmonians have sent\r\none ambassador!\" \"Yes,\" answered he cleverly and laconically, \"one\r\nambassador to one king.\"\r\n\r\nOne day when Demetrius came out of his palace he appeared to be in a\r\nmore affable humour than usual, and willing to converse with his\r\nsubjects. Upon this, many persons ran to present him with written\r\nstatements of their grievances. As he received them all and placed them\r\nin the folds of his cloak, the petitioners were greatly delighted, and\r\naccompanied him; but when he came to the bridge over the Axius, he\r\nemptied them all out of his cloak into the river. This conduct greatly\r\nexasperated the Macedonians, who declared that they were insulted\r\ninstead of being governed by him, and who remembered or were told by\r\nolder men how gentle and easy of access Philip was always wont to be.\r\n\r\nOnce an old woman met him when he was walking, and begged repeatedly for\r\na hearing. When he replied that he had no leisure to attend to her, she\r\nloudly cried out, \"Then be king no more.\" Stung by this taunt he\r\nreturned to his palace, and gave audiences to all who wished it,\r\nbeginning with the old woman, and so continued for many days. Indeed\r\nnothing becomes a king so much as to do justice to his subjects. As\r\nTimotheus the poet has it, Ares is a despot, but Pindar tells us that\r\nlaw is lord of all. Homer also says that kings have been entrusted by\r\nZeus, not with City-takers or brazen-bound ships, but with justice,\r\nwhich they must keep and respect; and that Zeus does not love the most\r\nwarlike or the most unjust of kings, but the most righteous, and calls\r\nhim his friend and disciple. Demetrius however rejoiced in being called\r\nby a name most unlike that of the Lord of Heaven, for his title is \"The\r\nPreserver of Cities,\" while Demetrius was known as \"The Besieger.\" Thus\r\nthrough the worship of mere brute force, the bad gradually overcame the\r\ngood side of his character, and his fame became sullied by the unworthy\r\nacts with which it was associated.\r\n\r\nXLIII. While Demetrius lay dangerously ill at Pella, he very nearly lost\r\nhis kingdom, as Pyrrhus invaded the country and briskly overran it as\r\nfar as Edessa. However, on his recovery, Demetrius easily drove Pyrrhus\r\nout of Macedonia, and then made terms with him, because he did not wish\r\nto be entangled in a border warfare, which would interfere with the\r\nrealisation of his more important projects. He meditated a colossal\r\nenterprise indeed, nothing less than the recovery of the whole of his\r\nfather's empire. His preparations were on a commensurate scale, for he\r\nhad collected a force of ninety-eight thousand foot soldiers and nearly\r\ntwelve thousand horse, while at Peiræus, Corinth, Chalkis, and the ports\r\nnear Pella he was engaged in the construction of a fleet of five hundred\r\nships. He himself personally superintended the works, visiting each\r\ndockyard and giving directions to the artificers; and all men were\r\nastounded not only at the number, but at the size of the vessels which\r\nwere being built. Before his time no one had ever seen a ship of fifteen\r\nor sixteen banks of oars, although in later times Ptolemy Philopator\r\nbuilt a ship of forty banks of oars, which measured two hundred and\r\neighty cubits in length, and forty-eight cubits in height. This ship was\r\nnavigated by four hundred sailors, four thousand rowers, and, besides\r\nall these, had room upon its decks for nearly three thousand soldiers.\r\nBut this ship was merely for show, and differed little from a fixed\r\nbuilding, being totally useless, and only moved with great risk and\r\nlabour; whereas the beauty of the ships of Demetrius did not render them\r\nless serviceable, nor was their equipment so elaborate as to interfere\r\nwith their use, but they were no less admirable for speed and strength\r\nas for greatness of size.\r\n\r\nXLIV. When this great armament, the largest ever collected since the\r\ndeath of Alexander, began to menace Asia, the three princes, Ptolemy,\r\nSeleukus, and Lysimachus, formed a confederation to oppose it. They next\r\nsent a joint letter to Pyrrhus, in which they urged him to attack\r\nMacedonia, and not to pay any regard to a peace by which Demetrius had\r\nnot made any engagement not to go to war with him, but had merely\r\nobtained time to attack the others first. Pyrrhus agreed to this\r\nproposal, and Demetrius, before his preparations were completed, found\r\nhimself involved in a war of considerable magnitude: for Ptolemy sailed\r\nto Greece with a large fleet and caused it to revolt from Demetrius,\r\nwhile Lysimachus from Thrace and Pyrrhus from Epirus invaded Macedonia\r\nand ravaged the country. Demetrius left his son to command in Greece,\r\nand himself marched to attack Lysimachus, in order to free Macedonia\r\nfrom the enemy. He shortly, however, received the news that Pyrrhus had\r\ntaken the city of Beroea, and when the Macedonians heard this, there was\r\nan end to all discipline, for the camp was full of tears and\r\nlamentations, and abuse of Demetrius. The men no longer cared to remain\r\nwith him, but became eager to go away, nominally to their homes, but\r\nreally to desert to Lysimachus. Demetrius upon this determined to place\r\nthe greatest possible distance between Lysimachus and himself, and\r\naccordingly marched to attack Pyrrhus; reasoning that Lysimachus was a\r\nnative of Macedonia, and was popular with many of the Macedonians\r\nbecause he had been a companion of Alexander, while he thought that the\r\nMacedonians would not prefer a foreigner like Pyrrhus to himself.\r\nHowever, in this expectation he was greatly deceived: for as soon as he\r\nencamped near Pyrrhus, his soldiers had a constant opportunity of\r\nadmiring his personal prowess in battle, and they had from the most\r\nancient times been accustomed to think that the best warrior is the best\r\nking. When besides this they learned how leniently Pyrrhus had dealt\r\nwith the captives, as they had long been determined to transfer their\r\nallegiance from Demetrius to some one else, they now gladly agreed that\r\nit should be to Pyrrhus. At first they deserted to him secretly and few\r\nat a time; but soon the whole camp became excited and disturbed, and at\r\nlast some had the audacity to present themselves before Demetrius, and\r\nbid him seek safety in flight, for the Macedonians were tired of\r\nfighting to maintain his extravagance. Compared with the harsh language\r\nheld by many other Macedonians, this appeared to Demetrius to be very\r\nreasonable advice, and so proceeding to his tent, as though he were\r\nreally a play-actor and not a king, he changed his theatrical cloak for\r\none of a dark colour, and made his way out of the camp unobserved. Most\r\nof his soldiery at once betook themselves to plundering, and while they\r\nwere quarrelling with one another over the spoils of the royal tent,\r\nPyrrhus appeared, encountered no resistance, and made himself master of\r\nthe camp. Pyrrhus and Lysimachus now divided between them the kingdom of\r\nMacedonia, which had for seven consecutive years been ruled by\r\nDemetrius.\r\n\r\nXLV. After this great disaster, Demetrius retired to Kassandreia. His\r\nwife Phila was greatly grieved at his fall, and could not bear to see\r\nDemetrius a miserable fugitive and exile after having been a king.\r\nDespairing of ever seeing better days, and bitterly reflecting how far\r\nher husband's good luck was outweighed by his misfortunes, she ended her\r\nlife by poison. Now Demetrius, anxious to save what he could from the\r\nwreck of his fortunes, proceeded to Greece, and there collected his\r\ngenerals and forces. The verses spoken by Menelaus in Sophokles's play--\r\n\r\n   \"But ever whirling on the wheel of fate\r\n    My fortune changes, like the changing moon\r\n    That never keeps her form two nights the same.\r\n    At first she comes with flattering countenance\r\n    And fills her orb; but when she is most bright\r\n    She wanes again, and loses all her light,\"\r\n\r\nseems to express very well the strange waxing and waning of the fortunes\r\nof Demetrius, who, as in the present instance, sometimes appeared to be\r\nquite extinguished, and then burst forth again as brilliant as ever, as\r\nlittle by little his power increased until he was able to carry out his\r\nplans. At first he visited the various cities of Greece dressed as a\r\nprivate man, without any of the insignia of royalty. One of the Thebans\r\nseeing him in this guise, cleverly applied to him the verses of\r\nEuripides:\r\n\r\n   \"A god no more, but dressed in mortal guise,\r\n    He comes to where the springs of Dirké rise.\"\r\n\r\nXLVI. When he again hoped to regain the style of royalty, and began to\r\ngather around him the form and substance of an empire, he permitted the\r\nThebans to remain independent. The Athenians, however, revolted from\r\nhim. They erased the name of Diphilus, who was inscribed upon the rolls\r\nas \"priest of the Saviours,\"[320] and decreed that archons should be\r\nelected after their ancestral custom; and they also sent to Macedonia to\r\ninvite Pyrrhus to come and help them, as they perceived that Demetrius\r\nwas becoming more powerful than they had expected. Demetrius indeed\r\nangrily marched upon Athens, and began to besiege the city, but the\r\nphilosopher Krates, an able and eloquent man, who was sent to make\r\nterms with him by the Athenian people, partly by entreaties, and partly\r\nby pointing out in what quarter his true interests lay, prevailed upon\r\nhim to raise the siege. Demetrius now collected what ships he could, and\r\nwith eleven thousand infantry and a few cavalry soldiers sailed to Asia,\r\nintending to detach the provinces of Lydia and Karia from Lysimachus's\r\ndominions. At Miletus he was met by Eurydike,[321] the sister of Phila,\r\nwho brought him her daughter Ptolemäis, who had been long before\r\npromised to him in the treaty concluded by the mediation of Seleukus.\r\nDemetrius married her, and immediately after the wedding betook himself\r\nto gaining over the cities of Ionia, some of which joined him of their\r\nown accord, while others were forced to yield to his arms. He also\r\ncaptured Sardis, and several of the officers of Lysimachus deserted to\r\nhim, bringing him both soldiers and money. When, however, Lysimachus's\r\nson Agathokles came to attack him with a large force, he withdrew into\r\nPhrygia, meaning if possible to gain possession of Armenia, stir up\r\nMedia to revolt, and make himself master of the provinces in the\r\ninterior, among which a fugitive could easily find an abundance of\r\nplaces of refuge. Agathokles pressed him hard, and Demetrius, although\r\nvictorious in all the skirmishes which took place, was reduced to great\r\nstraits, as he was cut off from his supplies of provisions and forage,\r\nwhile his soldiers began to suspect him of meaning to lead them to\r\nArmenia and Media. Famine now began to distress his army, and he also\r\nlost a large body of men, who were swept away in crossing the river\r\nLykus through mistaking the ford. Yet the men did not cease to joke; and\r\none of them wrote before the tent of Demetrius the first verses of the\r\nplay of OEdipus at Kolonus, slightly altered:\r\n\r\n   \"Child of Antigonus, the blind old man,\r\n    What place is this, at which we have arrived?\"\r\n\r\nXLVII. At last famine, as usually happens, produced a pestilence,\r\nbecause the men ate whatever they could find; and Demetrius, after\r\nlosing no less than eight thousand, gave up his project, and led back\r\nthe remainder. He proceeded to Tarsus, and would, if possible, have\r\nabstained from living on the neighbouring country which belonged to\r\nSeleukus, and so giving him an excuse for attacking him. However, this\r\nwas impossible, as his soldiers were reduced to the last extremities of\r\nwant, and Agathokles had fortified the passes of the Taurus range of\r\nmountains. Demetrius now wrote a letter to Seleukus, containing a long\r\nand piteous account of his misfortunes, and begging Seleukus as a\r\nrelative to take pity on one who had suffered enough to make even his\r\nenemies feel compassion for him. Seleukus seems to have been touched by\r\nthis appeal. He wrote to his generals, ordering them to show Demetrius\r\nthe respect due to royalty, and to supply his troops with provisions;\r\nbut now Patrokles, who was thought to be a man of great wisdom, and who\r\nwas a friend of Seleukus, pointed out to him that the expense of feeding\r\nthe troops of Demetrius was not a matter of great importance, but that\r\nit was a grievous error to allow Demetrius himself to remain in his\r\nterritory. He reminded him that Demetrius had always been the most\r\nturbulent and enterprising of princes, and that he was now in a position\r\nwhich would urge the most moderate and peaceable of men to deeds of\r\nreckless daring and treachery. Struck by this reasoning, Seleukus\r\nstarted for Cilicia in person, at the head of a large army. Demetrius,\r\nastonished and alarmed at this rapid change in Seleukus's attitude,\r\nretreated to a strong position at the foot of the Taurus mountains, and\r\nin a second letter requested Seleukus to allow him to conquer some\r\nnative territory occupied by independent tribes, in which he might\r\nrepose after his wanderings, or at least to let him maintain his forces\r\nin Cilicia during the winter, and not to drive him out of the country\r\nand expose him to his enemies in a destitute condition.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. Seleukus viewed all these proposals with suspicion, and offered\r\nto let him pass two months of the winter in Cataonia, but demanded his\r\nchief officers as hostages, and at the same time began to secure the\r\npasses leading into Syria. Demetrius, who was now shut up like a wild\r\nbeast in a trap, was driven to use force, overran the country, and\r\nfought several slight actions successfully with Seleukus. On one\r\noccasion he withstood a charge of scythed chariots, and routed the\r\nenemy, and he also drove away the garrison of one of the passes, and\r\ngained the command of the road to Syria. He now became elated by\r\nsuccess, and perceiving that his soldiers had recovered their\r\nconfidence, he determined to fight Seleukus for his kingdom. Seleukus\r\nhimself was now in difficulties. He had refused Lysimachus's offer of\r\nassistance, through suspicion, and he feared to engage with Demetrius in\r\nbattle, dreading the effects of his despair and the sudden turns of his\r\nfortune. However, at this crisis Demetrius was seized by a disorder\r\nwhich nearly carried him off, and utterly ruined his prospects; for some\r\nof his soldiers deserted to the enemy, and some dispersed to their own\r\nhomes. After forty days he was able to place himself at the head of the\r\nremaining troops, and with them marched so as to lead the enemy to\r\nsuppose that he meant to return to Cilicia; but as soon as it was dark\r\nhe started without any sound of trumpet in the opposite direction,\r\ncrossed the pass of Amanus, and began to plunder the plain of\r\nKyrrhestis.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Shortly afterwards Seleukus made his appearance, and pitched his\r\ncamp hard by. Demetrius now got his men under arms in the night and\r\nstarted to surprise Seleukus, whose army expected no attack, and was for\r\nthe most part asleep. When he was informed of his danger by some\r\ndeserters he leaped up in terror, and began putting on his boots and\r\nshouting to his friends that a savage beast was coming to attack them.\r\nDemetrius, observing from the noise which filled the enemy's camp that\r\nthey had notice of his attempt, quickly marched back again. He was\r\nattacked at daybreak by Seleukus, and gained some advantage by a flank\r\nattack. But now Seleukus himself dismounted, took off his helmet, and\r\nwith only a small shield in his hand went up to the mercenary troops of\r\nDemetrius, showing himself to them and inviting them to join him. They\r\nknew that he had for a long time refrained from attacking them out of a\r\nwish to spare their lives, and not for the sake of Demetrius; and they\r\nall greeted him, saluted him as King, and joined his army. Demetrius,\r\nwho had seen so many turns of good and ill fortune, felt that this blow\r\nwas final. He fled towards the pass of Amanus, and with a few friends\r\nand attendants took refuge in a thick wood for the night, hoping to be\r\nable to gain the road to Kaunus and so to reach the sea, where he hoped\r\nto find his fleet assembled. But when he found that his party had not\r\nenough money to procure them provisions even for one day, he was forced\r\nto adopt other plans. Soon, however, he was joined by Sosigenes, one of\r\nhis friends, who had four hundred gold pieces in his belt, and with this\r\ntreasure they hoped to be able to reach the sea, and started as soon as\r\nit grew dark to make their way over the mountains. But when they saw the\r\nenemy's watch-fires blazing all along the heights, they despaired of\r\neffecting their passage by that route, and returned to the place whence\r\nthey had set out, diminished in numbers, for some had deserted, and\r\ngreatly disheartened. When one of them ventured to hint that Demetrius\r\nought to surrender himself to Seleukus, Demetrius seized his sword and\r\nwould have made away with himself, but his friends stood round him, and\r\nat length talked him over into giving himself up. He sent a messenger to\r\nSeleukus, putting himself unreservedly in his hands.\r\n\r\nL. Seleukus, when he heard what had happened, said that it was his own\r\ngood fortune, not that of Demetrius, which had saved Demetrius's life,\r\nand had given himself an opportunity of displaying his clemency and\r\ngoodness as well as his other virtues. He at once sent for his servants\r\nand bade them construct a royal tent, and make every preparation for the\r\nreception of Demetrius in a magnificent fashion. There was one\r\nApollonides at the court of Seleukus, who had been an intimate friend of\r\nDemetrius, and Seleukus at once sent him to Demetrius, to bid him be of\r\ngood cheer, and not fear to meet his friend and relative Seleukus. When\r\nthe King's pleasure became known, a few at first, but afterwards the\r\ngreater part of his followers, eagerly flocked to pay their court to\r\nDemetrius, who they imagined would become the second man in the kingdom.\r\nThis ill-judged zeal of theirs turned the compassion of Seleukus into\r\njealousy, and enabled mischief-makers to defeat his kindly intentions by\r\nwarning him that as soon as Demetrius was seen in his camp all his\r\ntroops would rise in mutiny against him. Apollonides had just reached\r\nDemetrius in high spirits, and others were arriving with wonderful\r\nstories about the goodness of Seleukus. Demetrius himself was just\r\nrecovering his spirits after his disaster, was beginning to think that\r\nhe had been wrong in his reluctance to surrender himself, and was full\r\nof hope for the future, when Pausanias appeared with about a thousand\r\nhorse and foot-soldiers. He suddenly surrounded Demetrius with these\r\ntroops, separated him from his friends, and, instead of bringing him\r\ninto the presence of Seleukus, conducted him to the Syrian Chersonese,\r\nwhere, though strongly guarded, he was supplied by Seleukus with\r\nsuitable lodging and entertainment, and allowed to take the air and hunt\r\nin the royal park which adjoined his dwelling. He was permitted to\r\nassociate with any of the companions of his exile whom he wished to see,\r\nand many polite messages were sent to him from Seleukus to the effect\r\nthat as soon as Antiochus and Stratonike arrived, they would come to\r\nsome amicable arrangement.\r\n\r\nLI. Demetrius now despatched letters to his son, and to the commanders\r\nof his garrisons at Athens and Corinth, warning them not to pay any\r\nattention to any despatches which they might receive in his name, or\r\neven to his royal signet, but to regard him as practically dead, and to\r\nhold the cities in trust for his heir Antigonus. His son was much\r\ngrieved at hearing of his father's capture, put on mourning, and sent\r\nletters to all the other kings, and to Seleukus himself, begging for his\r\nfather's liberation. He offered to give up all the places which he still\r\nheld, and even proposed to surrender himself as a hostage in place of\r\nhis father. Many cities and princes supported his request, except\r\nLysimachus, who offered to give Seleukus a large sum of money if he\r\nwould put Demetrius to death. But Seleukus, who had always disliked\r\nLysimachus, now regarded him with abhorrence as a savage villain, and\r\nstill continued to keep Demetrius in captivity, under the pretext that\r\nhe was waiting for the arrival of his son Antiochus and Stratonike, that\r\nthey might have the pleasure of restoring him to liberty.\r\n\r\nLII. Demetrius at first bore up manfully against his misfortunes, and\r\nlearned to endure captivity, taking exercise as well as he could, by\r\nhunting in the park, and by running; but, little by little, he neglected\r\nthese amusements, addicted himself to drinking and dicing, and thus\r\nspent most of his time; either in order to escape from the thoughts of\r\nhis present condition by intoxication, or else because he felt that this\r\nwas the life which he had always wished to lead, and that he had caused\r\ngreat suffering both to himself and to others by fighting by sea and\r\nland in order to obtain that comfort which he had now unexpectedly\r\ndiscovered in repose and quiet. What, indeed, is the object of the wars\r\nand dangers which bad kings endure, in their folly, unless it be this?\r\nalthough they not only strive after luxury and pleasure, instead of\r\nvirtue and honour, but do not even understand in what real luxury and\r\nenjoyment consist. Be that as it may, Demetrius, after living in\r\nconfinement in the Chersonese for three years, died of laziness, surfeit\r\nand over-indulgence in wine, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.[322]\r\nSeleukus was greatly blamed for the suspicions which he had entertained\r\nabout Demetrius, and greatly repented that he had not imitated the wild\r\nThracian Dromichætes, who dealt so kindly and royally with Lysimachus\r\nwhen he had taken him prisoner.\r\n\r\nLIII. Even the funeral of Demetrius had an air of tragedy and theatrical\r\ndisplay. His son Antigonus, as soon as he heard that the ashes of his\r\nfather were being brought to him, collected all his fleet and met the\r\nvessels of Seleukus near the Cyclades. Here he received the relics in a\r\ngolden urn on board of his own flagship, the largest of his fleet. At\r\nevery port at which they touched the citizens laid garlands upon the\r\nurn, and sent deputies in mourning to attend the funeral. When the fleet\r\narrived at Corinth, the urn was beheld in a conspicuous place upon the\r\nstern of the ship, adorned with a royal robe and diadem, and surrounded\r\nby armed soldiers of the king's bodyguard. Near it was seated the\r\ncelebrated flute-player Xenophantus, playing a sacred hymn; and the\r\nmeasured dip of the oars, keeping time to the music, sounded like the\r\nrefrain of a dirge. The crowds who thronged the sea-shore were\r\nespecially touched by the sight of Antigonus himself, bowed down with\r\ngrief and with his eyes full of tears. After due honours had been paid\r\nto the relics at Corinth, he finally deposited them, in the city of\r\nDemetrias, which was named after his father, and which had been formed\r\nby amalgamating the small villages in the neighbourhood of Iolkos.\r\nDemetrius, by his wife Phila, left one son, Antigonus, and one daughter,\r\nStratonike. He also had two sons named Demetrius, one, known as Leptus,\r\nby an Illyrian woman, and the other, who became ruler of Cyrene, by\r\nPtolemais. By Deidameia he had a son named Alexander, who spent his life\r\nin Egypt. It is said, too, that he had a son named Korrhagus by\r\nEurydike. His family retained the throne of Macedonia for many\r\ngenerations, until it ended in Perseus, during whose reign the Romans\r\nconquered that country. So now that we have brought the career of the\r\nMacedonian hero to a close, it is time for us to bring the Roman upon\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ANTONIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The grandfather of Antonius was the orator Antonius,[323] who\r\nbelonged to the party of Sulla and was put to death by Marius. His\r\nfather was Antonius, surnamed Creticus,[324] not a man of any great note\r\nor distinction in political affairs, but of good judgment and integrity,\r\nand also liberal in his donations, as one may know from a single\r\ninstance. He had no large property and for this reason he was prevented\r\nby his wife from indulging his generous disposition. On one occasion\r\nwhen an intimate friend came to him who was in want of money, and\r\nAntonius had none, he ordered a young slave to put some water into a\r\nsilver vessel and to bring it; and when it was brought, he moistened his\r\nchin as if he were going to shave himself. The slave being sent away on\r\nsome other business, Antonius gave the cup to his friend and bade him\r\nmake use of it; but as a strict inquiry was made among the slaves, and\r\nAntonius saw that his wife was vexed and intended to torture them one by\r\none, he acknowledged what he had done and begged her pardon.\r\n\r\nII. His wife was Julia of the family of the Cæsars, a woman who could\r\ncompare with the noblest and most virtuous of that day. She brought up\r\nher son Antonius, having married after his father's death Cornelius\r\nLentulus,[325] who was one of the conspirators with Catilina and was put\r\nto death by Cicero. This appears to be the reason and the foundation of\r\nthe violent enmity between Antonius and Cicero. Now Antonius says that\r\neven the corpse of Lentulus was not given up to them until his mother\r\nbegged it of the wife of Cicero. But this is manifestly false, for no\r\none of those who were then punished by Cicero was deprived of interment.\r\nAntonius was of distinguished appearance in his youth, but his\r\nfriendship and intimacy with Curio[326] fell upon him, as they say, like\r\nsome pestilence, for Curio himself was intemperate in his pleasures, and\r\nhe hurried Antonius, in order to make him more manageable, into drinking\r\nand the company of women and extravagant and licentious expenditure. All\r\nthis brought on him a heavy debt, and out of all bounds for his age, of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty talents. Curio became security for all this, and\r\nwhen his father heard of it he banished Antonius from the house.\r\nAntonius for a short time mixed himself up with the violence of Clodius,\r\nthe most daring and scandalous of the demagogues of the day, which was\r\nthrowing every thing into confusion; but becoming soon satiated with\r\nthat madness and being afraid of those who were combining against\r\nClodius, he left Italy for Greece and spent some time there, exercising\r\nhis body for military contests and practising oratory. He adopted what\r\nwas called the Asiatic style of oratory, which flourished most at that\r\ntime, and bore a great resemblance to his mode of life, which was\r\nboastful and swaggering and full of empty pride and irregular aspiration\r\nafter distinction.\r\n\r\nIII. When Gabinius,[327] a man of consular rank, was sailing for Syria,\r\nhe endeavoured to persuade Antonius to join the expedition. Antonius\r\nsaid that he would not go out with him as a private individual, but on\r\nbeing appointed commander of the cavalry, he did go with him. In the\r\nfirst place he was sent against Aristobulus,[328] who was stirring the\r\nJews to revolt, and he was the first man to mount the largest of the\r\nfortifications; and he drove Aristobulus from all of them. He next\r\njoined battle with him and with the few men that he had put to flight\r\nthe forces of Aristobulus, which were much more numerous, and killed all\r\nbut a few; and Aristobulus was captured with his son. After this\r\nPtolemæus[329] attempted to persuade Gabinius for ten thousand talents\r\nto join him in an invasion of Egypt and to recover the kingdom for him;\r\nbut most of the officers opposed the proposal, and Gabinius himself was\r\nsomewhat afraid of the war, though he was hugely taken with the ten\r\nthousand talents; but Antonius, who was eager after great exploits and\r\nwished to gratify the request of Ptolemæus, persuaded Gabinius and urged\r\nhim to the expedition. They feared more than the war the march to\r\nPelusium, which was through deep sand where there was no water along the\r\nEcregma[330] and the Serbonian marsh, which the Egyptians call the\r\nblasts of Typhon[331], but which really appears to be left behind by the\r\nRed Sea[332] and to be caused by the filtration of the waters at the\r\npart where it is separated by the narrowest part of the isthmus from\r\nthe internal sea. Antonius being sent with the cavalry not only\r\noccupied the straits, but taking Pelusium also, a large city, and the\r\nsoldiers in it, he at the same time made the road safe for the army and\r\ngave the general sure hopes of victory. Even his enemies reaped\r\nadvantage from his love of distinction; for when Ptolemæus entered\r\nPelusium, and through his passion and hatred was moved to massacre the\r\nEgyptians, Antonius stood in the way and stopped him. And in the battles\r\nand the contests which were great and frequent, he displayed many deeds\r\nof daring and prudent generalship, but most signally in encircling and\r\nsurrounding the enemy in the rear, whereby he secured the victory to\r\nthose in front, and received the rewards of courage and fitting honours.\r\nNor did the many fail to notice his humanity towards Archelaus[333]\r\nafter his death; for Antonius, who had been his intimate and friend,\r\nfought against him during his lifetime of necessity, but when he found\r\nthe body of Archelaus, who had fallen, he interred it with all honours\r\nand in kingly fashion. He thus left among the people of Alexandria the\r\nhighest reputation, and was judged by the Roman soldiers to be a most\r\nillustrious man.\r\n\r\nIV. With these advantages he possessed a noble dignity of person; and\r\nhis well-grown beard, his broad forehead and hooked nose[334] appeared\r\nto express the manly character which is observed in the paintings and\r\nsculptures of Hercules. And there was an old tradition that the Antonii\r\nwere Herakleidæ, being sprung from Anton, a son of Hercules. This\r\ntradition Antonius thought that he strengthened by the character of his\r\nperson, as it has been observed, and by his dress. For on all occasions,\r\nwhen he was going to appear before a number of persons, he had his tunic\r\ngirded up to his thigh, and a large sword hung by his side, and a thick\r\ncloak thrown round him. Besides, that which appeared to others to be\r\noffensive, his great boasting and jesting and display of his cups, and\r\nhis sitting by the soldiers when they were eating, and his eating\r\nhimself as he stood by the soldiers' table--it is wonderful how much\r\naffection and attachment for him it bred in the soldiers. His amorous\r\npropensities, too, had in them something that was not without a charm,\r\nbut even by these he won the favour of many, helping them in their love\r\naffairs and submitting to be joked with good humour about his own\r\namours. His liberality and his habit of gratifying the soldiers and his\r\nfriends in nothing with a stinted or sparing hand, both gave him a\r\nbrilliant foundation for power, and, when he had become great, raised\r\nhis power still higher, though it was in danger of being subverted by\r\nten thousand other faults. I will relate one instance of his profusion.\r\nHe ordered five-and-twenty ten thousands to be given to one of his\r\nfriends; this sum the Romans express by Decies.[335] But as his steward\r\nwondered thereat, and to show him how much it was, placed the money out,\r\nhe asked as he was passing by, What that was. The steward replying that\r\nthis was what he had ordered to be given, Antonius, who conjectured his\r\ntrickery, said, \"I thought a Decies was more: this is a small matter;\r\nand therefore add to it as much more.\"\r\n\r\nV. Now these things belong to a later period. But when matters at Rome\r\ncame to a split, the aristocratical party joining Pompeius who was\r\npresent, and the popular party inviting Cæsar from Gaul, who was in\r\narms, Curio, the friend of Antonius,[336] changing sides in favour of\r\nCæsar, brought Antonius over; and as he had great influence among the\r\nmany by his eloquence, and spent money lavishly, which was supplied by\r\nCæsar, he got Antonius appointed tribune, and then one of the priests\r\nover the birds, whom the Romans call Augurs. As soon as Antonius entered\r\non his office, he was of no small assistance to those who were directing\r\npublic affairs on Cæsar's behalf. In the first place, when Marcellus the\r\nconsul attempted to give to Pompeius the troops that were already\r\nlevied, and to empower him to raise others, Antonius opposed him by\r\nproposing an order, that the collected force should sail to Syria and\r\nassist Bibulus, who was warring with the Parthians, and that the troops\r\nwhich Pompeius was levying should not pay any regard to him: and, in the\r\nsecond place, when the Senate would not receive Cæsar's letters, nor\r\nallow them to be read, Antonius, whose office gave him power, did read\r\nthem, and he changed the disposition of many, who judged from Cæsar's\r\nletters that he only asked what was just and reasonable. Finally, when\r\ntwo questions were proposed in the Senate, of which one was, whether\r\nPompeius should disband his troops, and the other, whether Cæsar should\r\ndo it, and there were a few in favour of Pompeius laying down his arms,\r\nand all but a few were for Cæsar doing so, Antonius arose and put the\r\nquestion, Whether the Senate was of opinion that Pompeius and Cæsar at\r\nthe same time should lay down their arms and disband their forces. All\r\neagerly accepted this proposal, and with shouts praising Antonius, they\r\nurged to put the question to the vote. But as the consuls would not\r\nconsent, the friends of Cæsar again made other proposals, which were\r\nconsidered reasonable, which Cato resisted, and Lentulus, who was\r\nconsul, ejected Antonius from the Senate. Antonius went out uttering\r\nmany imprecations against them, and assuming the dress of a slave, and\r\nin conjunction with Cassius Quintus[337] hiring a chariot he hurried to\r\nCæsar; and as soon as they were in sight, they called out that affairs\r\nat Rome were no longer in any order, since even tribunes had no liberty\r\nof speech, but every one was driven away and in danger who spoke on the\r\nside of justice.\r\n\r\nVI. Upon this Cæsar with his army entered Italy. Accordingly Cicero, in\r\nhis Philippica, said that Helen[338] was the beginning of the Trojan\r\nwar, and Antonius of the civil war, wherein he is manifestly stating a\r\nfalsehood. For Caius Cæsar was not such a light person, or so easy to be\r\nmoved from his sound judgment by passion, if he had not long ago\r\ndetermined to do this, as to have made war on his country all of a\r\nsudden, because he saw Antonius in a mean dress and Cassius making their\r\nescape to him in a hired chariot; but this gave a ground and specious\r\nreason for the war to a man who had long been wanting a pretext. He was\r\nled to war against the whole world, as Alexander before him and Cyrus of\r\nold had been, by an insatiable love of power and a frantic passion to be\r\nfirst and greatest: and this he could not obtain, if Pompeius was not\r\nput down. He came then and got possession of Rome, and drove Pompeius\r\nout of Italy; and determining to turn first against the forces of\r\nPompeius in Iberia, and then, when he had got ready a fleet, to cross\r\nover to attack Pompeius, he entrusted Rome to Lepidus, who was prætor,\r\nand the forces and Italy to Antonius, who was tribune. Antonius\r\nforthwith gained the favour of the soldiers by taking his exercises with\r\nthem, and by generally living with them, and making them presents out of\r\nhis means; but to everybody else he was odious. For owing to his\r\ncarelessness he paid no attention to those who were wronged, and\r\nlistened with ill-temper to those who addressed him, and had a bad\r\nrepute about other men's wives. In fine, Cæsar's friends brought odium\r\non Cæsar's power, which, so far as concerned Cæsar's acts, appeared to\r\nbe anything rather than a tyranny: and of those friends Antonius, who\r\nhad the chief power and committed the greatest excesses, had most of the\r\nblame.\r\n\r\nVII. However, upon his return from Iberia, Cæsar[339] overlooked the\r\ncharges against him, and employing him in war because of his energy, his\r\ncourage, and his military skill, he was never disappointed in him. Now\r\nCæsar, after crossing the Ionian Gulf from Brundusium with a few men,\r\nsent his ships back, with orders to Gabinius[340] and Antonius to put\r\nthe troops on board and carry them over quickly to Macedonia. Gabinius\r\nwas afraid of the voyage, which was hazardous in the winter season, and\r\nled his army by land a long way about; but Antonius being alarmed for\r\nCæsar, who was hemmed in by many enemies, repulsed Libo,[341] who was\r\nblockading the mouth of the harbour, by surrounding his gallies with\r\nmany light boats, and embarking in his vessels eight thousand legionary\r\nsoldiers he set sail. Being discovered by the enemy and pursued, he\r\nescaped all danger from them in consequence of a strong south wind\r\nbringing a great swell and tempestuous sea upon his gallies; but as he\r\nwas carried in his ships towards precipices and cliffs with deep water\r\nunder them, he had no hope of safety. But all at once there blew from\r\nthe bay a violent south-west wind and the swell ran from the land to the\r\nsea, and Antonius getting off the land and sailing in gallant style saw\r\nthe shore full of wrecks. For thither the wind had cast up the gallies\r\nthat were in pursuit of him and no small number of them was destroyed;\r\nand Antonius made many prisoners and much booty, and he took Lissus, and\r\nhe gave Cæsar great confidence by coming at a critical time with so\r\ngreat a force.\r\n\r\nVIII. There were many and continuous fights, in all of which Antonius\r\nwas distinguished: and twice he met and turned back the soldiers of\r\nCæsar, who were flying in disorder, and by compelling them to stand and\r\nto fight again with their pursuers he gained the victory. There was\r\naccordingly more talk of him in the camp than of any one else after\r\nCæsar. And Cæsar showed what opinion he had of him; for when he was\r\ngoing to fight the last battle and that which decided everything at\r\nPharsalus,[342] he had the right wing himself, but he gave the command\r\nof the left to Antonius as being the most skilful and bravest officer\r\nthat he had. After the battle Cæsar was proclaimed dictator, and he set\r\nout in pursuit of Pompeius, but he appointed Antonius master of the\r\nhorse and sent him to Rome: this is the second office in rank when the\r\ndictator is present; but if he is not, it is the first and almost the\r\nonly one. For the tribuneship continues, but they put down all the other\r\nfunctionaries when a dictator is chosen.\r\n\r\nIX. However Dolabella,[343] who was then a tribune, a young man who\r\naimed at change, introduced a measure for the annulling of debts, and\r\nhe persuaded Antonius,[344] who was a friend of his and always wished to\r\nplease the many, to work with him and to take a part in this political\r\nmeasure. But Asinius and Trebellius gave him the contrary advice, and it\r\nhappened that a strong suspicion came on Antonius, that he was wronged\r\nin the matter of his wife by Dolabella. And as he was much annoyed\r\nthereat, he not only drove his wife from his house, who was his cousin,\r\nfor she was the daughter of Caius Antonius who was consul with Cicero,\r\nbut he joined Asinius and resisted Dolabella. Dolabella occupied the\r\nForum with the design of carrying the law by force, but Antonius, after\r\nthe Senate had declared by a vote that it was needful to oppose\r\nDolabella with arms, came upon him and joining battle killed some of the\r\nmen of Dolabella and lost some of his own. This brought on Antonius the\r\nhatred of the many, and he was not liked by the honest and sober on\r\naccount of his habits of life, as Cicero says, but was detested; for\r\npeople were disgusted at his drunkenness at unseasonable hours, and his\r\nheavy expenditure, and his intercourse with women, and his sleeping by\r\nday, and walking about with head confused and loaded with drink, and by\r\nnight his revellings and theatres and his presence at the nuptials of\r\nmimi and jesters. It is said indeed that after being present at the\r\nentertainment on the marriage of Hippias the mime, and drinking all\r\nnight, when the people summoned him early in the morning to the Forum,\r\nhe came there still full of food and vomited, and one of his friends\r\nplaced his vest under to serve him. Sergius the mime was one of those\r\nwho had the greatest influence over him, and Cytheris[345] from the same\r\nschool, a woman whom he loved, and whom when he visited the cities he\r\ntook round with him in a litter; and there were as many attendants to\r\nfollow the litter as that of his mother. People were also vexed at the\r\nsight of golden cups carried about in his excursions as in processions,\r\nand fixing of tents in the ways, and the laying out of costly feasts\r\nnear groves and rivers, and lions yoked to chariots, and houses of\r\norderly men and women used as quarters for prostitutes and lute-players.\r\nFor it was considered past all endurance that, while Cæsar was lodging\r\nin the open field out of Italy, clearing up the remnant of war with\r\ngreat labour and danger, others, through means of Cæsar's power, were\r\nindulging in luxury and insulting the citizens.\r\n\r\nX. These things appear also to have increased the disorder and to have\r\ngiven the soldiers licence to commit shameful violence and robbery.\r\nWherefore, when Cæsar returned, he pardoned Dolabella; and being elected\r\nconsul for the third time he chose not Antonius, but Lepidus for his\r\ncolleague. Antonius bought the house of Pompeius when it was sold, but\r\nhe was vexed when he was asked for the money; and he says himself that\r\nthis was the reason why he did not join Cæsar in his Libyan expedition,\r\nhaving had no reward for his former successes. However Cæsar is\r\nconsidered to have cured him of the chief part of his folly and\r\nextravagance by not allowing his excesses to pass unnoticed. For he gave\r\nup that course of life and turned his thoughts to wedlock, taking for\r\nhis wife Fulvia, who had been the wife of the demagogue Clodius, a woman\r\nwho troubled herself not about domestic industry or housekeeping, nor\r\none who aspired to rule a private man, but her wish was to rule a ruler\r\nand command a general: so that Cleopatra was indebted to Fulvia[346] for\r\ntraining Antonius to woman-rule, inasmuch as Cleopatra received him\r\nquite tamed and disciplined from the commencement to obey women. However\r\nAntonius attempted by sportive ways and youthful sallies to make Fulvia\r\nsomewhat merrier; as for example, on the occasion when many went to meet\r\nCæsar after his victory in Iberia, Antonius also went; but as a report\r\nsuddenly reached Italy that Cæsar was dead and the enemy were advancing,\r\nhe returned to Rome, and taking a slave's dress he came to the house by\r\nnight, and saying that he brought a letter from Antonius to Fulvia, he\r\nwas introduced to her wrapped up in his dress. Fulvia, who was in a\r\nstate of anxiety, asked, before she took the letter, whether Antonius\r\nwas alive; but without speaking a word he held out the letter to her,\r\nand when she was beginning to open and read it, he embraced and kissed\r\nher. These few out of many things I have produced by way of instance.\r\n\r\nXI. When Cæsar was returning from Iberia[347] all the first people went\r\nseveral days' journey to meet him; but Antonius was specially honoured\r\nby Cæsar. For in his passage through Italy he had Antonius in the\r\nchariot with him, and behind him Brutus Albinus and Octavianus the son\r\nof his niece, who was afterwards named Cæsar and ruled the Romans for a\r\nvery long time. When Cæsar was appointed consul for the fifth time, he\r\nimmediately chose Antonius for his colleague, and it was his design to\r\nabdicate the consulship and give it to Dolabella; and this he proposed\r\nto the Senate. But as Antonius violently opposed this, and vented much\r\nabuse of Dolabella and received as much in return, Cæsar, being ashamed\r\nof these unseemly proceedings, went away. Afterwards when he came to\r\nproclaim Dolabella, upon Antonius calling out that the birds were\r\nopposed to it, Cæsar yielded and gave up Dolabella, who was much\r\nannoyed. But it appeared that Cæsar abominated Dolabella as much as he\r\ndid Antonius; for it is said, that when some person was endeavouring to\r\nexcite his suspicions against both, Cæsar said that he was not afraid of\r\nthose fat and long-haired fellows, but those pale and thin ones, meaning\r\nBrutus and Cassius, who afterwards conspired against him and slew him.\r\n\r\nXII. And Antonius without designing it gave them a most specious\r\npretext. It was the feast of the Lykæa among the Romans, which they\r\ncall Lupercalia,[348] and Cæsar dressed in a triumphal robe and sitting\r\non the Rostra in the Forum viewed the runners. Now many youths of noble\r\nbirth run the race, and many of the magistrates, anointed with oil, and\r\nwith strips of hide they strike by way of sport those whom they meet.\r\nAntonius running among them paid no regard to the ancient usage, but\r\nwrapping a crown of bay round a diadem he ran to the Rostra, and being\r\nraised up by his companions in the race he placed it on Cæsar's head,\r\nintimating that he ought to be King. But as Cæsar affected to refuse it\r\nand put his head aside, the people were pleased and clapped their hands;\r\nthen Antonius again offered the crown, and Cæsar again rejected it. This\r\ncontest went on for some time, only a few of the friends of Antonius\r\nencouraging him in his pressing the offer, but all the people shouted\r\nand clapped when Cæsar refused; which indeed was surprising, that while\r\nin reality they submitted to be ruled over with kingly power they\r\neschewed the name of King as if it were the destruction of their\r\nfreedom. Accordingly Cæsar rose from the Rostra much annoyed, and taking\r\nthe robe from his neck called out that he offered his throat to any one\r\nwho would have it. The crown which was placed on one of his statues\r\ncertain tribunes tore off, and the people followed them with loud\r\nexpressions of goodwill and clapping of hands; but Cæsar deprived them\r\nof their office.\r\n\r\nXIII. This confirmed Brutus and Cassius, and when they were enumerating\r\nthe friends whom they could trust in the undertaking, they deliberated\r\nabout Antonius. The rest were for adding Antonius to their number, but\r\nTrebonius opposed it; for he said that at the time when they went to\r\nmeet Cæsar on his return from Iberia, and Antonius was in the same tent\r\nwith him and journeyed with him, he tried his disposition in a quiet way\r\nand with caution, and he said that Antonius understood him, though he\r\ndid not respond to the proposal, nor yet did he report it to Cæsar, but\r\nfaithfully kept the words secret. Upon this they again deliberated\r\nwhether they should kill Antonius after they had killed Cæsar; but\r\nBrutus opposed this, urging that the act which was adventured in\r\ndefence of the laws and of justice must be pure and free from injustice.\r\nBut as they were afraid of the strength of Antonius and the credit that\r\nhis office gave him, they appointed some of the conspirators to look\r\nafter him in order that when Cæsar entered the Senate house and the deed\r\nwas going to be done, they might detain him on the outside in\r\nconversation about some matter and on the pretence of urgent business.\r\n\r\nXIV. This being accomplished according as it was planned and Cæsar\r\nhaving fallen in the Senate house, Antonius immediately put on a slave's\r\nattire and hid himself. But when he learned that the men were not\r\nattacking any one, but were assembled in the Capitol, he persuaded them\r\nto come down after giving them his son as a hostage; and he entertained\r\nCassius at supper, and Brutus entertained Lepidus. Antonius having\r\nsummoned the Senate spoke about an amnesty and a distribution of\r\nprovinces among Brutus and Cassius and their partizans, and the Senate\r\nratified these proposals, and decreed not to alter anything that had\r\nbeen done by Cæsar.[349] Antonius went out of the Senate the most\r\ndistinguished of men, being considered to have prevented a civil war and\r\nto have managed most prudently and in a most statesmanlike manner\r\ncircumstances which involved difficulties and no ordinary causes of\r\nconfusion. But from such considerations as these he was soon disturbed\r\nby the opinion that he derived from the multitude, that he would\r\ncertainly be the first man in Rome, if Brutus were put down. Now it\r\nhappened that when Cæsar's corpse was carried forth, as the custom was,\r\nhe pronounced an oration over it in the Forum;[350] and seeing that the\r\npeople were powerfully led and affected, he mingled with the praises of\r\nCæsar commiseration and mighty passion over the sad event, and at the\r\nclose of his speech, shaking the garments of the dead, which were\r\nblood-stained and hacked with the swords, and calling those who had done\r\nthese things villains and murderers, he inspired so much indignation in\r\nthe men that they burnt the body of Cæsar in the Forum, heaping together\r\nthe benches and the tables; and snatching burning faggots from the pile\r\nthey ran to the houses of the assassins and assaulted them.\r\n\r\nXV. For this reason Brutus and his party left the city, and the friends\r\nof Cæsar joined Antonius; and Cæsar's wife Calpurnia trusting to him had\r\nthe chief part of the treasures transferred to Antonius from her house,\r\nto the amount in all of four thousand talents. He received also the\r\nwritings of Cæsar, in which there were entries made of what he had\r\ndetermined and decreed; and Antonius inserting entries in them, named\r\nmany to offices just as he pleased, and many he named senators, and he\r\nrestored some who were in exile and released others who were in prison,\r\nas if Cæsar had determined all this. Wherefore the Romans by way of\r\nmockery named all these persons Charonitæ,[351] because when they were\r\nput to the proof they had to take refuge in the memoranda of the\r\ndeceased. And Antonius managed everything else as if he had full power,\r\nbeing consul himself, and having his brothers also in office, Gaius as\r\nprætor and Lucius as tribune.\r\n\r\nXVI. While affairs were in this state, young Cæsar[352] arrived at Rome,\r\nbeing the son of the niece of the deceased, as it has been told, and\r\nleft the heir of his substance; and he was staying in Apollonia at the\r\ntime of Cæsar's assassination. He went forthwith to pay his respects to\r\nAntonius, as being his father's friend, and reminded him of the money\r\ndeposited with him; for he had to pay to every Roman seventy-five\r\ndrachmæ, which Cæsar had given by his will. Antonius, at first despising\r\nhis youth, said that he was not in his senses, and that being destitute\r\nof all sound reason and friends he was taking up the succession of\r\nCæsar, which was a burden too great for him to bear; but as Cæsar did\r\nnot yield to these arguments and demanded the money, Antonius went on\r\nsaying and doing many things to insult him. For he opposed him in\r\nseeking a tribuneship, and when he was preparing to set up a golden\r\nchair of his father, as it had been voted by the Senate, he threatened\r\nto carry him off to prison, if he did not stop his attempts to win the\r\npopular favour. But when the youth, by giving himself up to Cicero and\r\nthe rest who hated Antonius, by means of them made the Senate his\r\nfriends, and he himself got the favour of the people and mustered the\r\nsoldiers from the colonies,[353] Antonius being alarmed came to a\r\nconference with him in the Capitol, and they were reconciled. Antonius\r\nin his sleep that night had a strange dream; he thought that his right\r\nhand was struck by lightning; and a few days after a report reached him\r\nthat Cæsar was plotting against him. Cæsar indeed made an explanation,\r\nbut he did not convince Antonius; and their enmity was again in full\r\nactivity, and both of them roaming about Italy endeavoured to stir up by\r\nlarge pay the soldiers who were planted in the colonies, and to\r\nanticipate one another in gaining over those who were still under arms.\r\n\r\nXVII. Of those in the city Cicero had the greatest influence; and by\r\ninciting everybody against Antonius he finally persuaded the Senate to\r\nvote Antonius to be an enemy, and to send Cæsar lictors and the insignia\r\nof a prætor, and to despatch Pansa and Hirtius[354] to drive Antonius\r\nout of Italy. They were consuls for that year; and engaging with\r\nAntonius near the city of Mutina, on which occasion Cæsar was present\r\nand fought with them, they defeated the enemy, but fell themselves. Many\r\ngreat difficulties befell Antonius in his flight; but the greatest was\r\nfamine. But it was the nature of Antonius to show his best qualities in\r\ndifficulties, and in his misfortune he was as like as may be to a good\r\nman; for it is common to those who are hard pressed by straits to\r\nperceive what virtue is, but all have not strength enough in reverses to\r\nimitate what they admire and to avoid what they do not approve; but some\r\nrather give way to their habits through weakness and let their judgment\r\nbe destroyed. Now Antonius in these circumstances was a powerful pattern\r\nto the soldiers, for though he was fresh from the enjoyment of so much\r\nluxury and expense, he drank foul water without complaining, and ate\r\nwild fruits and roots. Bark too was eaten, as it was said, and in their\r\npassage over the Alps they fed on animals that had never been eaten\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nXVIII. His design was to fall in with the troops there which\r\nLepidus[355] commanded, who was considered to be a friend of Antonius\r\nand to have derived through him much advantage from the friendship of\r\nCæsar. Having arrived there and encamped near, he found no friendly\r\nsigns, on which he resolved to try a bold stroke. Antonius had neglected\r\nhis hair and he had allowed his beard to grow long immediately after his\r\ndefeat; and putting on a dark garment he approached the lines of Lepidus\r\nand began to speak. As many of the soldiers were moved at the sight and\r\naffected by his words, Lepidus in alarm ordered the trumpets to sound\r\nall at once and so to prevent Antonius from being heard. But the\r\nsoldiers pitied the more, and held communication with him by means of\r\nLælius and Clodius, whom they secretly sent to him in the dress of women\r\nwho followed the camp, and the messengers urged Antonius boldly to\r\nattack the lines, for there were many, they said, would undertake even\r\nto kill Lepidus, if he wished. Antonius would not consent to their\r\ntouching Lepidus, but on the next day he began to cross the river with\r\nhis army. Antonius entered the river first and advanced to the opposite\r\nbank, for he saw already many of the soldiers of Lepidus stretching out\r\ntheir hands to him and tearing down the ramparts. When he had entered\r\nand made himself master of all, he approached Lepidus with the greatest\r\nkindness, for he embraced him and called him father; and in fact he was\r\nmaster of all, but he continued to preserve to Lepidus the name and\r\nhonour of an Imperator. This caused also Plancus Munatius to join him,\r\nfor Plancus was at no great distance with a large force. Being thus\r\nraised anew to great power he crossed the Alps into Italy at the head of\r\nseventeen legions of infantry and ten thousand cavalry; besides this he\r\nleft to guard Gaul six legions with Varius, one of his intimates and\r\nboon companions, whom they called Cotylon.[356]\r\n\r\nXIX. Now Cæsar no longer cared for Cicero when he saw that he clung to\r\nliberty, but he invited Antonius through the mediation of his friends to\r\ncome to terms. The three met together in a small island[357] in the\r\nmiddle of a river and sat together for three days. All the rest was\r\neasily agreed on, and they distributed the empire[358] among them as if\r\nit were a paternal inheritance, but the discussion about the men who\r\nwere destined to perish caused them most trouble, each claiming to get\r\nrid of his enemies and to save his relations. But at length surrendering\r\nto their passion against those whom they hated both the honour due to\r\ntheir kinsmen and their goodwill to their friends, Cæsar surrendered\r\nCicero to Antonius, and Antonius surrendered to him Lucius Cæsar, who\r\nwas his uncle on the mother's side; Lepidus also was allowed to put to\r\ndeath his brother Paulus; but others say that Lepidus gave up his\r\nbrother to Cæsar and Antonius, who required his death. I think nothing\r\ncould be more cruel or savage than this exchange; for by exchanging\r\nmurder for murder they equally destroyed those whom they surrendered and\r\nthose whom they put to death, but they acted more unjustly to their\r\nfriends, whom they caused to die even without bearing them any hatred.\r\n\r\nXX. After this settlement, the soldiers, who were around them, required\r\nthat Cæsar should strengthen their friendship by marriage, and should\r\ntake to wife Clodia,[359] the daughter of Fulvia, the wife of Antonius.\r\nThis also being agreed to, three hundred persons were by proscription\r\nput to death by them.[360] When Cicero was murdered, Antonius ordered\r\nthe head to be cut off and the right hand, with which Cicero wrote the\r\nspeeches against him. When they were brought, Antonius looked on them\r\nwith delight and broke out a laughing several times through joy; then\r\nbeing satiated with the sight he ordered them to be placed above the\r\nRostra in the Forum, as if he were insulting the dead, and not showing\r\nhis own arrogance in his good fortune and abusing his power. His uncle\r\nCæsar being sought and pursued fled for refuge to his sister, who, when\r\nthe assassins were standing by and trying to force their way into her\r\nchamber, fixing herself at the door and spreading out her arms, called\r\nout repeatedly, \"You shall not kill Cæsar Lucius, unless you kill me\r\nfirst, me the mother of the Imperator.\" By such her conduct she rescued\r\nand saved her brother.\r\n\r\nXXI. The dominion of the three was in most respects hateful to the\r\nRomans; but Antonius had most of the blame, as he was older than Cæsar,\r\nand had more influence than Lepidus, and threw himself without restraint\r\ninto his former luxurious and intemperate habits as soon as he had\r\nshaken off all trouble about affairs. There was added to his general bad\r\nrepute the hatred against him on account of the house that he inhabited,\r\nwhich had been the house of Pompeius Magnus, a man no less admired for\r\nhis temperance and his orderly and citizenlike mode of life than for his\r\nthree triumphs. For they were vexed to see his house generally closed to\r\ncommanders, magistrates and ambassadors, who were insolently thrust from\r\nthe doors, while it was filled with mimi and jugglers and drunken\r\nflatterers, upon whom was expended most of the money which was got by\r\nthe most violent and harsh means. For the three not only sold the\r\nsubstance of those who were murdered, bringing false charges against\r\ntheir kinsmen and wives, and tried all kinds of imposts; but hearing\r\nthat there were deposits[361] with the Vestal Virgins made both by\r\nstrangers and citizens, they went and seized them. Now as nothing was\r\nenough for Antonius, Cæsar claimed to share the money with him; and they\r\nalso distributed the army between them, and both went together into\r\nMacedonia to oppose Brutus and Cassius; and they intrusted Rome to\r\nLepidus.\r\n\r\nXXII. Crossing over the sea they commenced the campaign and encamped by\r\nthe enemy, Antonius being opposed to Cassius, and Cæsar to Brutus,[362]\r\nwherein no great deed was performed on the part of Cæsar, but it was\r\nAntonius who gained all the victory and had all the success. In the\r\nfirst battle, Cæsar, being completely routed by Brutus, lost his camp\r\nand narrowly escaped from his pursuers; but, as he says in his Memoirs,\r\nhe retired before the battle in consequence of one of his friends having\r\nhad a dream. But Antonius defeated Cassius; though some have written\r\nthat Antonius was not in the battle, but came up after the battle to\r\njoin in the pursuit. Pindarus, one of the faithful freedmen of Cassius,\r\nkilled him at his request and order, for Cassius did not know that\r\nBrutus was victorious. After an interval of a few days they fought a\r\nsecond battle, in which Brutus being defeated killed himself, and\r\nAntonius carried off the chief credit of the victory, inasmuch as Cæsar\r\nwas sick. Standing over the corpse of Brutus he upbraided it gently for\r\nthe death of his brother Caius,[363] for Brutus had put Caius to death\r\nin Macedonia to revenge Cicero; but declaring that he blamed Hortensius\r\nmore than Brutus for the murder of his brother, Antonius ordered him to\r\nbe massacred on his tomb; and he threw over the body of Brutus his own\r\npurple cloak, which was of great value, and commanded one of his\r\nfreedmen to look after the interment. He afterwards found out that this\r\nfellow did not burn the cloak with the corpse and that he had purloined\r\na large part of the expenditure destined for the interment, whereon he\r\nput him to death.\r\n\r\nXXIII. After this Cæsar went back to Rome, and it was supposed that he\r\nwould not live long on account of his illness. Antonius crossed over\r\ninto Greece with a large army, intending to levy money in all the\r\neastern provinces; for as they had promised to every soldier five\r\nthousand drachmæ, they required more vigorous measures for raising money\r\nand collecting contributions. Towards the Greeks his conduct was neither\r\nunusual nor oppressive at first, but his love of amusement led him to\r\nlisten to the discourses of the learned and to the sight of games and\r\nreligious solemnities; and in his decisions he was equitable, and was\r\ndelighted at being called a Philhellen, but still more in being\r\naddressed as Philathenæus; and he made rich gifts to the city. The\r\npeople of Megara also wishing to show him something fine, by way of\r\nrivalry with Athens, and requesting him to see the Senate-house, he went\r\nup and looked at it, and on their asking what he thought of it: \"Small,\r\nit is true,\" he said, \"and yet all in decay.\" He also caused the temple\r\nof the Pythian Apollo to be surveyed, as if he intended to repair it;\r\nfor he made this promise to the Senate.\r\n\r\nXXIV.[364] Leaving Lucius Censorinus[365] over the affairs of Greece he\r\ncrossed to Asia; and when he had touched the wealth there, and kings\r\nused to come to his door, and wives of kings vying with one another in\r\ntheir presents and their beauty let themselves be corrupted in order to\r\nwin his favour, and while Cæsar at Rome was worn out with civil\r\ncommotions and war, he enjoying perfect leisure and tranquillity was\r\ncarried back by his passions to his usual habits of life, and\r\nAnaxenor[366] a lute-player and Xuthus a piper and Metrodorus a dancer,\r\nand other such rout of Asiatic theatrical folks who surpassed in\r\nimpudence and shamelessness the pests from Italy, had crept in and\r\nmanaged his residence--it was past all bearing, for everything was wasted\r\non these extravagancies. For all Asia, like that city in Sophocles,[367]\r\nat the same time was filled with incense burning,\r\n\r\n   \"With pæans too 'twas filled and heavy groans.\"\r\n\r\nThus, when he was entering Ephesus, women clothed like Bacchæ, and men\r\nand boys equipped like Satyrs and Pans led the way; and the city was\r\nfilled with ivy and thyrsi and psalteries and pipes and flutes, the\r\npeople calling him Dionysus, Giver of Joy and Beneficent. He was this,\r\nit is true, to some; but to the many Omestes[368] and Agrionius. For he\r\ntook their property from well-born men and gave it to worthless men and\r\nflatterers; and certain persons got the substance of many who were still\r\nalive by asking for it as if they were dead. He gave the house of a\r\ncitizen of Magnesia to a cook, who, as it is said, had distinguished\r\nhimself by a single entertainment. Finally, when he was imposing a\r\nsecond contribution on the citizens, Hybreas[369] was bold enough in\r\nspeaking on behalf of Asia to use these words, which were indeed such as\r\nthe common folks would have in their mouths, but were not ill adapted to\r\nflatter[370] the vanity of Antonius, \"If thou canst take contributions\r\ntwice in one year, thou canst also make for us summer twice and\r\nharvest-time twice;\" but he concluded with these practical and bold\r\nwords, that Asia had given twenty ten thousands of talents; and \"if thou\r\nhast not had them, demand them of those who have received the money; but\r\nif thou hast received and hast them not, we are undone.\" By these words\r\nhe made a strong impression on Antonius, for he was ignorant of the\r\ngreater part of what was going on; and not so much because he was\r\nindolent, as because in his simplicity he trusted those about him. For\r\nthere was in his character simplicity and slow perception; but when he\r\ndid perceive his errors, there was strong repentance, and acknowledgment\r\nto those who had been wronged, and excess both in the restitution that\r\nhe made and the punishment that he inflicted. Yet he was considered to\r\nsurpass the bounds of moderation rather in conferring favours than in\r\npunishing. His rudeness in mirth and bantering carried its own remedy\r\nwith it; for a man might return him as good as he gave; and he took as\r\nmuch pleasure in being laughed at as in laughing at others. And this did\r\nhim mischief in most things; for he could not believe that those who\r\nspoke so freely in jest, could flatter him in earnest, and as he was\r\neasily caught by praise, not knowing that some persons by mingling\r\nfreedom of expression, like a sharpish sauce, with flattery, took away\r\nfrom flattery its nauseating insipidity, by their boldness and babbling\r\nover their cups striving to make their yielding in matters of business\r\nand their assent appear, not the way of persons who keep about a man\r\nmerely to please him, but of those who are overpowered by superior\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nXXV. Such was the disposition of Antonius, upon which a crowning evil\r\nthe love for Cleopatra supervening, and stirring up and maddening many\r\nof the passions that were still concealed in him and lying quiet, caused\r\nto vanish and utterly destroyed whatever of goodness and of a saving\r\nnature still made resistance in him. And he was captured in this\r\nfashion. When he was preparing for the Parthian war, he sent her orders\r\nto meet him in Cilicia to give an account of the charges made against\r\nher of supplying Cassius with much money and contributions for the war.\r\nDellius,[371] who was sent, observing her person and marking her\r\ncleverness in speaking and her versatility, soon perceived that Antonius\r\nwould never even think of doing such a woman any harm, but that she\r\nwould have the greatest influence with him; and he applied himself to\r\npaying his court to her, and he encouraged the Egyptian, in the words of\r\nHomer,[372] to go to Cilicia bedecked in her best fashion and not to be\r\nafraid of Antonius, who was the most pleasant and kindest of generals.\r\nBeing persuaded by Dellius, and collecting from the proofs of her charms\r\nupon Caius Cæsar and Cnæus the son of Pompeius, she had hopes that she\r\nshould more easily win over Antonius. For they knew her when she was yet\r\na girl and inexperienced in affairs, but she was going to visit Antonius\r\nat an age in which women have the most brilliant beauty and their\r\nunderstanding has attained its perfection. Accordingly she got together\r\nmany presents and money and ornaments, such as one might suppose that\r\nshe could bring from the greatness of her estate and the wealth of her\r\nkingdom, but she went to Cilicia relying chiefly on herself and the\r\nseductions and charms of her own person.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Though Cleopatra[373] received many letters of summons both from\r\nAntonius[374] and his friends, she so despised and mocked the man, that\r\nshe sailed up the Cydnus in a vessel with a gilded stern, with purple\r\nsails spread, and rowers working with silver oars to the sound of the\r\nflute in harmony with pipes and lutes. Cleopatra reclined under an\r\nawning spangled with gold, dressed as Venus is painted, and youths\r\nrepresenting the Cupids in pictures stood on each side fanning her. In\r\nlike manner the handsomest of her female slaves in the dress of Nereids\r\nand Graces, were stationed some at the rudders and others at the ropes.\r\nAnd odours of wondrous kind from much incense filled the banks. Some of\r\nthe people accompanied her immediately from the entrance of the river on\r\nboth sides, and others went down from the city to see the sight. As the\r\ncrowd from the Agora also poured forth, Antonius was finally left on the\r\ntribunal sitting alone. A rumour went abroad that Venus was coming to\r\nrevel with Bacchus for the good of Asia. Now Antonius sent to invite\r\nCleopatra to supper, but she on her part said that he should rather come\r\nto her. Antonius accordingly, wishing to display some good nature and\r\nkindness, obeyed and came. He found a preparation greater than he\r\nexpected, but he was most surprised at the number of the lights: for it\r\nis said that so many lights were hung down and shewn on all sides at\r\nonce and arranged and put together in such inclinations and positions\r\nwith respect to one another in the form of squares and circles, that of\r\nthe few things that are beautiful and worthy of being seen this sight\r\nwas one.\r\n\r\nXXVII. On the following day when Antonius feasted her in turn he was\r\nambitious to surpass her splendour and taste, but he was left behind and\r\ninferior in both, and in these very things he was the first to scoff at\r\nthe coarseness and rusticity of his own entertainment. Cleopatra,\r\nobserving in the jests of Antonius much of the soldier and the\r\nunpolished man, adopted the same manner towards him freely and boldly.\r\nNow her beauty, as they say, was not in itself altogether incomparable\r\nnor such as to strike those who saw her; but familiarity with her had an\r\nirresistible charm, and her form, combined with her persuasive speech\r\nand with the peculiar character which in a manner was diffused about her\r\nbehaviour, produced a certain piquancy. There was a sweetness also in\r\nthe sound of her voice when she spoke; and as she could easily turn her\r\ntongue, like a many-stringed instrument, to any language that she\r\npleased, she had very seldom need of an interpreter for her\r\ncommunication with barbarians, but she answered most by herself, as\r\nEthiopians,[375] Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabs, Syrians, Medes, Parthians.\r\nShe is said also to have learned the language of many other peoples,\r\nthough the kings her predecessors had not even taken the pains to learn\r\nthe Egyptian language, and some of them had even given up the Macedonian\r\ndialect.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Now she so captivated Antonius, that though his wife Fulvia was\r\ncarrying on war at Rome against Cæsar on behalf of the interests of\r\nAntonius, and a Parthian army was hovering about Mesopotamia, of which\r\nthe king's generals had named Labienus[376] Parthian governor, and they\r\nwere about to enter Syria, he allowed himself to be carried off by her\r\nto Alexandria; and there staying and amusing himself like a young man\r\nwho had leisure, he consumed and expended upon pleasure the most costly\r\nof all things, as Antiphon said, Time. They had a kind of company called\r\nInimitable Livers; and they daily feasted one another, making an\r\nincredible profusion in their expenditure. Now Philotas of\r\nAmphissa,[377] a physician, used to relate to my grandfather Lamprias,\r\nthat he was then in Alexandria learning his profession, and having got\r\nacquainted with one of the royal cooks, he was persuaded by him, as was\r\nnatural in a young man, to view the costliness and the preparation for\r\nthe table. Accordingly he was introduced into the kitchen, where he saw\r\neverything in great abundance, and eight wild boars roasting, which made\r\nhim wonder at the number of the guests. Hereupon the cook laughed and\r\nsaid, the party at supper was not large, only about twelve; but it was\r\nnecessary that everything which was served up should be in perfection,\r\nwhich a moment of time would spoil. He said it might happen that\r\nAntonius should wish to sup immediately, and if it so happened, he might\r\ndefer it by asking for a cup or by falling into some conversation; and\r\naccordingly, he continued, not one supper is prepared, but many, for the\r\nexact time is difficult to conjecture. This is what Philotas used to\r\ntell; and in the course of time, as he related, he was among those who\r\nattended on the eldest son of Antonius, whom he had by Fulvia, and he\r\nsupped with him with the rest of his companions, as a general rule, when\r\nhe did not sup with his father. On one occasion there was a physician\r\npresent who was bragging greatly and much annoying the company at\r\nsupper, but Philotas stopped him by a sophism of this kind: \"If a man\r\nhas fever in some degree, we must give him cold water; but every man who\r\nhas fever has fever in some degree; we must therefore give cold water to\r\nevery man who has fever.\" The man was confounded and put to silence,\r\nwhereat the youth being pleased, laughed and said, \"All this, Philotas,\r\nI give you,\" pointing to a table full of many large cups. Philotas\r\nacknowledged his intended kindness, though he was far from thinking that\r\na boy of his age had authority to make such a present; but after awhile\r\none of the young slaves took hold of the cups and bringing them in a\r\nvessel bade him put a seal on it. As Philotas made objections and was\r\nafraid to take the things. \"Why, you fool,\" said the man, \"do you\r\nhesitate? Don't you know that the giver is the son of Antonius, and that\r\nhe has permission to give so many things of gold? If however you take my\r\nadvice, you will exchange the whole with us for a sum of money; for\r\nperchance the youth's father might call for some of the vessels, which\r\nare old and valued for their workmanship.\" Such anecdotes as these my\r\ngrandfather used to say that Philotas would occasionally tell.\r\n\r\nXXIX. But Cleopatra, by distributing flattery not, as Plato[378] says,\r\nin four ways, but in many ways, and by always adding some new pleasure\r\nand charm to whatever was either serious or mirthful, completely ruled\r\nAntonius, never leaving him by night nor by day. For she played at dice\r\nwith him, and drank with him, and hunted with him, and was a spectator\r\nwhen he was exercising in arms, and by night when he was standing at the\r\ndoors and windows of the common people and jesting with those within,\r\nshe accompanied him in his rambles and freaks, in the dress of a female\r\nslave; for Antonius also used to dress himself in this style.\r\nAccordingly he would return home always well loaded with coarse abuse\r\nand sometimes with blows. With the greater part he was in no good\r\ncredit; however the Alexandrines took delight in his extravagances, and\r\njoined in his follies without any lack of cleverness or humour, being\r\npleased therewith and saying that Antonius put on the tragic mask to the\r\nRomans, but the comic mask to them. Now to relate the greater part of\r\nhis follies would be mere trifling. However on one occasion when he was\r\nfishing and was vexed at his bad sport, Cleopatra also being present, he\r\nordered the fisherman to dive under the water and secretly to fasten to\r\nthe hook some fishes that had been already caught; and he pulled up two\r\nor three times, but not without being detected by the Egyptian.\r\nPretending to admire, she spoke to her friends and invited them to come\r\nas spectators on the following day. A number of them got into the\r\nfishing boats, and when Antonius had let down his line, she ordered one\r\nof her own men to anticipate him by diving to the hook and to fasten to\r\nit a Pontic salted fish.[379] Antonius thinking that he had caught\r\nsomething pulled up, on which there was, as was natural, great laughter,\r\nwhereat Cleopatra said, \"Give up the fishing-rod, Imperator, to us the\r\nkings of Pharos and Canopus; your sport is cities and kings and\r\ncontinents.\"\r\n\r\nXXX.[380] While Antonius was spending his time in such trifles and\r\nextravagances, he was surprised by intelligence from two different\r\nquarters; from Rome, that Lucius his brother and Fulvia his wife, having\r\nfirst been at variance with one another and then having warred with\r\nCæsar, were completely defeated and flying from Italy; the other\r\nintelligence was in no wise more favourable, which was that Labienus at\r\nthe head of the Parthians had subdued Asia from the Euphrates and Syria\r\nas far as Lydia and Ionia. With difficulty then, like a man roused from\r\nsleep and a drunken debauch, he set out to oppose the Parthians, and\r\nadvanced as far as Phoenice, but as Fulvia sent him letters full of\r\nlamentations he turned towards Italy, with two hundred ships. On this\r\nvoyage he took up his friends who had fled from Italy, and learned from\r\nthem that Fulvia had been the cause of the war, for she was naturally a\r\nbusy and bold woman; but her hope was to draw away Antonius from\r\nCleopatra, if their should be any disturbance in Italy. It happened that\r\nFulvia, who was sailing to meet him, died at Sikyon of some disease,\r\nwhich rendered a reconciliation with Cæsar more easy. For when Antonius\r\napproached Italy, and Cæsar was evidently not intending to make any\r\ncharge against him, and Antonius was ready to fix on Fulvia the blame of\r\nwhat he was charged with, their friends would not let them come to any\r\nexplanation of these grounds, but brought them both to terms and\r\ndistributed the empire, making the Ionian gulf the boundary, and giving\r\nthe eastern parts to Antonius and the western to Cæsar; Lepidus was\r\nallowed to keep Libya; and it was settled that the friends of each in\r\nturns should be consuls, when it did not please themselves to be.\r\n\r\nXXXI. This arrangement seemed to be good, but it required a stronger\r\nsecurity, and fortune offered one. Octavia[381] was a sister of Cæsar,\r\nolder than Cæsar, but not by the same mother; for she was the daughter\r\nof Ancharia, but he was born afterwards of Atia. Cæsar was very greatly\r\nattached to his sister, and it is said she was a most admirable woman.\r\nOctavia was now a widow, for her husband Caius Marcellus had not long\r\nbeen dead. As Fulvia was dead, Antonius also was considered to be a\r\nwidower; he did not deny that he had Cleopatra, but he did not admit\r\nthat he had her as a wife, and he was still struggling in his judgment\r\non this point against his love for the Egyptian. Everybody was proposing\r\nthis marriage in the hope that Octavia, who in addition to great beauty\r\npossessed dignity of character and good sense, if she were united to\r\nAntonius and were beloved by him, as it was reasonable to suppose that\r\nsuch a woman must be, would be the conservation and cause of union\r\nbetween them in all respects. This being arranged between them, they\r\nwent up to Rome where the marriage of Octavia was celebrated, though the\r\nlaw did not allow a woman to marry till ten months after her husband's\r\ndecease, but the Senate in this case remitted the time by a decree.\r\n\r\nXXXII. As Sextus[382] Pompeius was still in possession of Sicily and was\r\nravaging Italy, and with his numerous piratical ships, of which Menas\r\nthe pirate and Menekrates were commanders, had rendered the sea unsafe\r\nto vessels, and as he seemed to be in a friendly disposition towards\r\nAntonius, for he had received his mother when she had fled from Rome\r\nwith Fulvia, it was resolved to come to terms with him also. They met at\r\nthe promontory of Misenum and the mound, the fleet of Pompeius being\r\nanchored close by them, while the forces of Antonius and Cæsar were\r\narranged by the side of them. Having agreed that Pompeius should have\r\nSardinia and Sicily on condition of keeping the sea clear of pirates and\r\nsending to Rome a certain quantity of grain, they invited one another to\r\nan entertainment. They cast lots on the occasion, and it was the lot of\r\nPompeius to feast them first. Upon Antonius asking him where they should\r\nsup, \"There,\" said he, pointing to the commander's ship of six banks of\r\noars, \"for this is all the paternal residence that is left for\r\nPompeius.\" This he said to reproach Antonius, who had the house that had\r\nbelonged to the father of Sextus. Fixing his ship at anchor and making a\r\nkind of bridge from the promontory, he received them with a hearty\r\nwelcome. When the banquet was at its height and jokes against Cleopatra\r\nand Antonius were plentiful, Menas the pirate approaching Pompeius said\r\nto him, so that the rest could not hear, \"Will you let me cut off the\r\nanchors of the ship and make you master not of Sicily and Sardinia, but\r\nof the Roman empire?\" Pompeius, on hearing this, considered with himself\r\nfor a short time, and said, \"You ought to have done it, Menas, without\r\nmentioning it to me: but now let us be satisfied with things as they\r\nare; perjury is not for me.\" Pompeius, after being feasted by Cæsar and\r\nAntonius in turn, sailed back to Sicily.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. After the settlement of affairs, Antonius sent forward\r\nVentidius[383] into Asia to prevent the Parthians from advancing\r\nfurther, and, in order to please Cæsar, he was appointed priest of the\r\nformer Cæsar; and everything else that concerned public affairs they\r\ntransacted in common and in a friendly way. But their games of amusement\r\ncaused annoyance to Antonius, as he always carried off therein less than\r\nCæsar. Now there was with Antonius a man skilled in divinations, an\r\nEgyptian, one of those who cast nativities, who, whether it was to\r\nplease Cleopatra, or whether he said it in good faith, spoke freely to\r\nAntonius, saying that his fortune, though most splendid and great, was\r\nobscured by that of Cæsar, and he advised him to remove as far as\r\npossible from the young man: \"For thy dæmon,\" he said, \"is afraid of the\r\ndæmon of Cæsar, and though it is proud and erect when it is by itself,\r\nit is humbled by his dæmon when it is near, and becomes cowed.\" And\r\nindeed the things which were happening seemed to confirm the Egyptian;\r\nfor it is said that when they were casting lots by way of amusement, in\r\nwhatever they might happen to be engaged, and throwing dice, Antonius\r\ncame off with disadvantage. They frequently matched cocks,[384] and\r\nfighting quails, and those of Cæsar were always victorious. Whereat\r\nAntonius being annoyed, though he did not show it, and paying more\r\nregard to the Egyptian, departed from Italy, leaving the management of\r\nhis affairs to Cæsar; and he took with him Octavia as far as Greece,\r\nthere having been a daughter born to them. While he was spending the\r\nwinter in Athens, he received intelligence of the first successes of\r\nVentidius, who had defeated the Parthians in a battle, in which Labienus\r\nlost his life and Pharnapates, the most skilful of the generals of King\r\nHyrodes.[385] On the occasion of this victory Antonius feasted the\r\nGreeks; and he acted as gymnasiarch for the Athenians, and leaving at\r\nhome the insignia of his rank, he went forth with the rods of a\r\ngymnasiarch[386] and the dress and white shoes; and he took the youths\r\nby the neck when he separated them.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. As he was going to set out for the war, he took a crown from the\r\nsacred olive,[387] and in conformity to a certain oracle, he filled a\r\nvessel with water from the Clepsydra, and carried it with him. In the\r\nmean time Pacorus,[388] the king's son, with a large Parthian army\r\nagain advanced against Syria, but Ventidius engaged with him in\r\nCyrrhestica and put his army to flight with great loss; Pacorus himself\r\nfell among the first. This exploit, which was one of the most\r\ncelebrated, gave the Romans full satisfaction for the defeat of Crassus,\r\nand again confined the Parthians within Media and Mesopotamia, after\r\nbeing defeated in three successive battles. Ventidius gave up all\r\nintention of pursuing the Parthians further, because he feared the\r\njealousy of Antonius, but he visited those who had revolted and brought\r\nthem into subjection, and besieged Antiochus of Commagene[389] in the\r\ncity Samosata. The king proposed to pay a thousand talents and to obey\r\nthe order of Antonius, but Ventidius told him to send his proposal to\r\nAntonius; for he had now advanced near, and he would not allow Ventidius\r\nto make peace with Antiochus, because he wished that this single exploit\r\nat least should bear his name, and that everything should not be\r\naccomplished by Ventidius. As, however, the siege was protracted, and\r\nthe citizens, after despairing of coming to terms, betook themselves to\r\na vigorous defence, Antonius, who was making no progress, but was\r\nashamed and repented of his conduct, was glad to make peace with\r\nAntiochus and to take three hundred talents; and after settling some\r\ntrifling matters in Syria, he returned to Athens, and sent Ventidius to\r\nenjoy a triumph after bestowing on him the suitable decorations.\r\nVentidius is the only Roman to the present time who has had a triumph\r\nover the Parthians; and he was a man of obscure birth, but the\r\nfriendship of Antonius gave him the opportunity of doing great deeds, of\r\nwhich he made the best use, and so confirmed what was generally said of\r\nAntonius and Cæsar, that they were more successful as generals through\r\nothers than of themselves. For Sossius[390] also, a legatus of\r\nAntonius, had great success in Syria; and Canidius,[391] who was left by\r\nAntonius in Armenia, defeated the Armenians and the kings of the\r\nIberians and Albanians, and advanced as far as the Caucasus. All this\r\nsuccess increased the name and the fame of the power of Antonius among\r\nthe barbarians.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Antonius being again irritated against Cæsar by certain calumnies,\r\nsailed to Italy with three hundred vessels; but as the people of\r\nBrundusium would not receive his fleet, he sailed round and anchored at\r\nTarentum.[392] There he sent Octavia, for she accompanied him from\r\nGreece, at her request, to her brother: she was then pregnant, and had\r\nalready borne him two daughters. She met Cæsar on the way, and after\r\ngaining over his friends Agrippa and Mæcenas,[393] she prayed him with\r\nmuch urgency and much entreaty not to let her become a most wretched\r\nwoman after being most happy. For now, she said, all men turned their\r\neyes upon her, who was the wife of one Imperator and the sister of\r\nanother; \"but if the worse should prevail,\" she continued, \"and there\r\nshould be war, it is uncertain which of you must be the victor and which\r\nthe vanquished; but I shall be unfortunate both ways.\" Cæsar, being\r\nmoved by these words, came in a friendly manner to Tarentum, and those\r\nwho were present saw a most noble spectacle, a large army on land\r\ntranquil, and many ships quietly holding on the shore, and the meeting\r\nand friendly salutations of the two Imperators and their friends.\r\nAntonius gave an entertainment first, which Cæsar consented to for his\r\nsister's sake. It being agreed that Cæsar should give Antonius two\r\nlegions for the Parthian war, and that Antonius should give Cæsar a\r\nhundred brazen-beaked vessels. Octavia, independently of what had been\r\nagreed, asked for her brother twenty light ships[394] from her husband,\r\nand for her husband a thousand soldiers from her brother. Accordingly,\r\nseparating from one another, the one immediately engaged in the war\r\nagainst Pompeius,[395] being desirous to get Sicily; and Antonius,\r\nentrusting to Cæsar Octavia and his children by her and by Fulvia,\r\ncrossed over to Asia.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. That great evil, which had long slept, the passion for Cleopatra,\r\nwhich appeared to be put to rest and to have been tranquillised by\r\nbetter considerations, blazed forth again and recovered strength as\r\nAntonius approached Syria. And finally (as Plato[396] says of the\r\nstubborn and ungovernable beast of the soul), kicking away everything\r\nthat was good and wholesome, he sent Fonteius Capito to bring Cleopatra\r\nto Syria. On her arrival he gave and added to her dominions nothing\r\nsmall or trifling, but Phoenice, Coele Syria, Cyprus, a large part of\r\nCilicia, and further, that part of Judæa which produces the balsam, and\r\nall the part, of Arabia Nabathæa which was turned towards the external\r\nsea.[397] These donations caused the Romans the greatest vexation;\r\nthough he gave tetrarchies and kingdoms of great nations to many private\r\npersons, and took kingdoms from many, as for instance Antigonus[398] the\r\nJew, whom he brought out and beheaded, though no king before had been\r\npunished in this way. But the scandal of the thing was that which gave\r\nmore offence than all the honours conferred on Cleopatra. The evil\r\nreport was increased by his acknowledging his twin children by\r\nCleopatra, one of whom he called Alexander and the other Cleopatra; and\r\nhe gave to one the surname of Sun, and the other of Moon. However, he\r\nhad some dexterity in putting a good face on bad things, for he said\r\nthat the greatness of the Roman power was shown not in what they\r\nreceived, but in what they gave; and that noble families were extended\r\nby a succession and progeny of many kings. Thus, for instance, he said,\r\nthat his own ancestor was begotten by Hercules, who did not deposit his\r\nsuccessors in a single womb, nor did he fear laws like Solon's[399] and\r\npenalties for conception, but gave nature her course to leave many\r\nbeginnings and foundations of families.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. When Phraates[400] had killed his father Hyrodes and got\r\npossession of the kingdom, other Parthians fled, not few in number; and\r\namong them Monæses, a man of illustrious rank and great power, fled to\r\nAntonius, who likening the fortune of Monæses to that of\r\nThemistocles[401] and comparing his own means and magnanimity to those\r\nof the Persian kings, gave him three cities, Larissa and Arethusa and\r\nHierapolis, which was before called Bambyce. Upon the Parthian king\r\nsending to Monæses a right hand,[402] Antonius gladly despatched Monæses\r\nto him, having resolved to deceive Phraates with a pretence of peace,\r\nbut claiming the restoration of the standards taken in the time of\r\nCrassus and such of the prisoners as still survived. Antonius having\r\nsent Cleopatra back to Egypt, marched through Arabia[403] and Armenia to\r\na place where he reviewed his army, which had assembled there, and also\r\nthe troops of the confederate kings; and they were many, but the\r\ngreatest of all was Artavasdes,[404] king of Armenia, who supplied six\r\nthousand horse and seven thousand foot soldiers. There were of the\r\nRomans sixty thousand foot soldiers, and the cavalry which was classed\r\nwith the Romans was ten thousand Iberians[405] and Celts; and of the\r\nother nations there were thirty thousand together with cavalry and\r\nlight-armed troops. Yet so great a preparation and power, which alarmed\r\neven the Indians beyond Bactria and shook all Asia, it is said, was made\r\nof no avail to him by reason of Cleopatra. For through his eagerness to\r\nspend the winter with her, he opened the campaign before the fit time\r\nand conducted everything in a disorderly way, not having the mastery\r\nover his own judgment, but through the influence of some drugs or magic\r\nalways anxiously looking towards her, and thinking more of his speedy\r\nreturn than of conquering the enemy.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. Now, in the first place, though it was his business to winter\r\nthere in Armenia and to give his army rest, which was worn out by a\r\nmarch of eight thousand stadia, and before the Parthians moved from\r\ntheir winter-quarters in the commencement of spring, to occupy Media, he\r\ndid not wait for the time, but immediately led forward his army, leaving\r\nArmenia on the left and touching on Atropatene,[406] which he ravaged.\r\nIn the next place, the engines which were necessary for sieges were\r\ncarried along with the army in three hundred waggons, and among them was\r\na ram eighty feet long; and it was not possible for any one of them, if\r\nit was damaged, to be repaired when it was wanted, because the upper\r\ncountry only produced wood of insufficient length and hardness:\r\naccordingly in his hurry he left all the engines behind as encumbrances\r\nto his speed, after appointing a watch and Statianus as commander over\r\nthe waggons; and he commenced the siege of Phraata,[407] a large city,\r\nin which were the children and wives of the king of Media. But the\r\ndifficulties soon proved what an error he had committed in leaving\r\nbehind the engines; and as he wished to come to close quarters with the\r\nenemy, he commenced erecting a mound against the city, which rose slowly\r\nand with much labour. In the meantime Phraates came down with a great\r\nforce, hearing of the waggons being left behind that carried the\r\nmachines, and sent many horsemen against them, by whom Statianus was\r\nhemmed in and killed and ten thousand men with him. The barbarians took\r\npossession of the engines and destroyed them. They also took many\r\nprisoners, among whom was king Polemon.[408]\r\n\r\nXXXIX. This misfortune greatly annoyed, as we may suppose, all the\r\nsoldiers of Antonius, who at the commencement of the war had received\r\nthis unexpected blow; and the Armenian Artavasdes despairing of the\r\nsuccess of the Romans went off with his troops, though he had been the\r\nchief cause of the war. The Parthians now showed themselves to the\r\nbesiegers in gallant array and insultingly threatened them, on which\r\nAntonius, not wishing to let despondency and dejection abide in his army\r\nby their being quiet and to increase, took ten legions and three\r\nprætorian cohorts of heavy-armed men and all the cavalry, and led them\r\nout to forage in the hope that the enemy would thus be drawn on, and\r\nthat a regular battle would ensue. After advancing one day's march, he\r\nsaw that the Parthians were spreading themselves around him and seeking\r\nto attack him on the march, on which he hung out in the camp the sign of\r\nbattle, but at the same time he ordered the tents to be taken down, as\r\nif his intention were not to fight but to lead off his troops; and he\r\npassed along the line of the barbarians, which was in the form of a\r\ncrescent, having given orders, as soon as the first ranks of the enemy\r\nshould be within reach of the heavy-armed soldiers, for the cavalry to\r\nride at them. To the Parthians who stood opposed to the Romans, their\r\ndiscipline appeared to be something indescribable; and they observed the\r\nRomans as they marched past at equal intervals without disorder and in\r\nsilence, brandishing their spears. But when the standard was raised and\r\nthe cavalry facing about rushed upon the enemy, the Parthians received\r\ntheir onset and repelled it, though the Romans were all at once too\r\nclose to allow them to use their arrows; but when the heavy-armed\r\nsoldiers joined in the conflict at the same time with shouts and the\r\nclatter of arms, the Parthian horses were frightened and gave way and\r\nthe Parthians fled before they came to close quarters. Antonius pressed\r\non the pursuit, and had great hopes that he had finished the whole war\r\nor the chief part in that battle. But when the infantry had followed up\r\nthe pursuit for fifty stadia and the cavalry for three times that\r\ndistance, looking at those of the enemy who had fallen and were\r\ncaptured, they found only thirty captives and eighty corpses, which\r\ncaused dismay and despondency in all the army, when they reflected that\r\nthough victorious they had killed so few, and that when defeated they\r\nmust sustain such a loss as they had near the waggons. On the following\r\nday they broke up their encampment and took the road towards Phraata and\r\nthe camp. On their march they fell in at first with a few of the enemy,\r\nand then a greater number, and finally with all, who, as if they were\r\nunvanquished and fresh, challenged them and fell upon them from all\r\nsides, so that with difficulty and much labour they got safe to their\r\ncamp. As the Medes made a sally against the mound and terrified those\r\nwho were defending it, Antonius being enraged put in practice what is\r\ncalled decimation[409] against the cowards; for he divided the whole\r\nnumber into tens, and put to death one out of each ten who was chosen by\r\nlot; and to the rest he ordered barley to be measured out, instead of\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nXL. The war was attended with great hardship to both sides, and the\r\nfuture was still more alarming, as Antonius was expecting famine, for it\r\nwas no longer possible to get forage without many of the soldiers being\r\nwounded and killed. Phraates knowing that the Parthians were able to\r\nbear anything rather than to endure hardship in the winter and to encamp\r\nin the open air, was afraid lest, if the Romans held out and abided\r\nthere, his troops would leave him, as the atmosphere was beginning to\r\ngrow heavy after the autumnal equinox. Accordingly he planned such a\r\nstratagem as this. The chiefs of the Parthians,[410] both in the forages\r\nand on other occasions when they met the Romans, made less vigorous\r\nresistance, both allowing them to take some things and commending their\r\nvalour in that they were most courageous men, and were justly admired by\r\ntheir king. After this, riding up nearer to them, and quietly placing\r\ntheir horses near the Romans, they would abuse Antonius, saying that\r\nthough Phraates wished to come to terms and to spare so many brave men,\r\nAntonius would not give him the opportunity, but sat there awaiting\r\nthose dangerous and powerful enemies, hunger and winter, from whom it\r\nwould be difficult for them to escape, even under convoy of the\r\nParthians. Many persons reported this to Antonius, and though he was\r\nsoftened by hope, still he did not send heralds to the Parthians until\r\nhe inquired from the barbarians who assumed this friendly demeanour,\r\nwhether what they said really expressed the king's meaning. On their\r\nsaying that it was so, and urging him not to fear or distrust, he sent\r\nsome of his companions to demand back the standards and the captives,\r\nthat it might not be supposed that he was so eager to make his escape\r\nand get away. The Parthian told him not to trouble himself about that\r\nmatter, but promised him peace and security if he would depart\r\nforthwith; whereupon in a few days Antonius got his baggage together and\r\nbroke up his camp. Though Antonius had great powers of persuasion before\r\na popular assembly, and was skilled above every man of the age in\r\nleading an army by his words, he was unable through shame and depression\r\nof spirits to encourage the soldiers, and he bade Domitius\r\nÆnobarbus[411] do this. Some of the soldiers took this amiss,\r\nconsidering it as a token of contempt towards them, but the majority\r\nwere affected by it, and perceived the reason, and they thought that\r\nthey ought on this account the more to show their respect and obedience\r\nto the commander.\r\n\r\nXLI. As Antonius was intending to lead the troops back by the same road,\r\nwhich was through a plain country without trees, a man, by nation a\r\nMardian,[412] who was well acquainted with the Parthian habits, and had\r\nalready shown himself faithful to the Romans in the battle at the\r\nwaggons, came up to Antonius and advised him in his flight to keep to\r\nthe mountains on his right, and not to expose a force, in heavy armour\r\nand encumbered, to so numerous a cavalry and to the arrows in bare and\r\nopen tracts, which was the very thing that Phraates designed when he\r\ninduced him by friendly terms to raise the siege; and that he would lead\r\nthem a shorter road, where he would find a better supply of necessaries.\r\nAntonius on hearing this deliberated; he did not wish to appear to\r\ndistrust the Parthians after the truce, yet as he approved of the\r\nshorter road, and the line of march being along inhabited villages, he\r\nasked the Mardian for a pledge of his fidelity. The Mardian offered\r\nhimself to be put in chains until he should place the army in Armenia;\r\nand he was put in chains, and he conducted them for two days without\r\ntheir meeting with any opposition. On the third day, when Antonius had\r\ncompletely ceased to think of the Parthians, and was advancing in a\r\ncareless way by reason of his confidence, the Mardian observed that an\r\nembankment against the overflowing of a river had been recently broken,\r\nand that the stream was flowing in a great current on the road by which\r\nthey had to pass, and he knew that the Parthians had done this with the\r\nintention of making the river an obstacle to the Roman march by the\r\ndifficulty and delay that it would occasion; and he bade Antonius look\r\nout and be on his guard, as the enemy was near. Just while he was\r\nplacing the heavy-armed men in order, and taking measures for the\r\njavelin-men and slingers to make an attack through their ranks upon the\r\nenemy, the Parthians appeared and rode round them with the design of\r\nencircling the Romans and putting them in disorder on all sides. The\r\nlight-armed troops made a sally against them, and the Parthians, after\r\ninflicting some wounds with their arrows and receiving as many from the\r\nleaden bullets[413] and javelins of the Romans, retreated. The Parthians\r\nthen commenced a second attack, which continued until the Celtæ in a\r\nmass drove their horses against them and dispersed them; and the\r\nParthians showed themselves no more on that day.\r\n\r\nXLII. From this experience Antonius, learning what he ought to do,\r\ncovered not only the rear, but also both flanks with many javelin men\r\nand slingers, and led his army in the form of a quadrangle; and the\r\ncavalry received orders to repel the attack of the enemy, but when they\r\nhad repulsed them, not to pursue far, in consequence of which the\r\nParthians during the four following days sustained as much damage as\r\nthey inflicted, and their ardour being dulled they thought of retiring,\r\nas an excuse for which they alleged the approach of winter. On the fifth\r\nday Flavius Gallus, a man of military talent and great activity, who\r\nheld a command, came and asked Antonius for more light-armed troops for\r\nthe rear,[414] and for some of the cavalry from the van, in the\r\nexpectation of having great success. Antonius gave him the troops, and\r\nwhen the enemy made his attack, he fell upon them, not as on former\r\noccasions, at the same time withdrawing towards the heavy-armed soldiers\r\nand retreating, but resisting them and engaging with the enemy in a\r\ndesperate way. The commanders of the rear seeing that he was being\r\nseparated from them, sent and called him back, but he would not listen\r\nto them. They say that Titius the quæstor, seizing the standards, turned\r\nthem round and abused Gallus for throwing away the lives of many brave\r\nmen. But as Gallus abused him in turn, and urged those about him to\r\nremain, Titius retreated. While Gallus was pushing forwards against the\r\nenemy in front, a large body of those in the rear got round him before\r\nhe perceived it. Being now attacked on all sides he sent for aid; but\r\nthe commanders of the heavy-armed troops, among whom was Canidius, a man\r\nwho had the greatest influence with Antonius, are considered to have\r\ncommitted a great mistake. For when they ought to have moved the whole\r\nline against the enemy, they sent a few at a time to help against them;\r\nand again when these were being worsted, they sent others, and thus\r\nthese came near filling the whole army with defeat and flight before\r\nthey were aware of it; but Antonius himself quickly came with the\r\nheavy-armed men from the van to meet the enemy, and the third legion\r\nquickly pushing through the fugitives against the enemy stopped their\r\nfurther pursuit.\r\n\r\nXLIII. There fell no fewer than three thousand; and there were carried\r\nto the tents five thousand wounded, and among them Gallus, who was\r\npierced with five arrows in front. Gallus did not recover from his\r\nwounds; but Antonius, going about, visited the rest of the wounded, and\r\nhe encouraged them with tears in his eyes and deep sympathy. The men,\r\ncheerfully grasping his right hand, begged him to go and take care of\r\nhis health and not to trouble himself about them, calling him Imperator,\r\nand saying that they were all secure if he was only safe. For altogether\r\nit seems that no Imperator of that age got together an army more\r\ndistinguished by courage or endurance or strength; but the respect\r\ntowards the commander himself, and the obedience combined with\r\naffection, and the circumstance that all alike, those of good\r\nreputation, those of bad, commanders, private soldiers, preferred honour\r\nand favour from Antonius to their own lives and safety, left nothing\r\neven for the ancient Romans to surpass, and of this there were several\r\nreasons, as we have said before; noble birth, powerful eloquence,\r\nsimplicity, generosity and munificence, affability in his pleasures and\r\nconversation. On that occasion, by the pains that he took and his\r\nsympathy with the wounded, and by sharing with them whatever they\r\nwanted, he made the sick and wounded more full of alacrity than those\r\nwho were whole.\r\n\r\nXLIV. However the victory so elated the enemy, who were already worn out\r\nand exhausted, and they despised the Romans so much that they even\r\npassed the night[415] close to the camp, expecting that they should soon\r\nplunder the deserted tents and the baggage of the Romans skulking away.\r\nAt daybreak the enemy crowded upon them in still greater numbers, and\r\nthere are said to have been not fewer than forty thousand horsemen, as\r\nthe king had sent even those who were always placed around himself, as\r\nto certain and secure success; for the king himself was never present in\r\nany battle. But Antonius, wishing to harangue the soldiers, asked for a\r\ndark garment that he might appear more piteous. But as his friends\r\nopposed him, he came forward in the purple dress of a general and\r\naddressed the troops, praising those who had been victorious, and\r\nupbraiding those who had fled. The former exhorted him to be of good\r\ncheer, and the others making their apology offered themselves to him\r\neither to be decimated or to be punished in any other way; only they\r\nprayed him to cease being troubled and grieved. Hereupon, raising his\r\nhands, he prayed to the gods, that if any reverse of fortune should\r\nfollow on account of his former prosperity, it might come upon him, but\r\nthat they would give safety and victory to the rest of the army.\r\n\r\nXLV. On the following day they advanced under better protection; and\r\nwhen the Parthians made their attack, the result was very contrary to\r\ntheir expectations. For they expected to advance to plunder and booty,\r\nand not to battle; but as they were assailed by many missiles, and saw\r\nthat the Romans were encouraged and fresh with alacrity, they were again\r\ncompletely wearied of the contest. However the Parthians again fell upon\r\nthem as they were descending some steep hills, and galled them with\r\narrows as they were slowly retreating, whereon the shield-bearers[416]\r\nfaced about and placing the light-armed troops within their ranks,\r\ndropped down on one knee and held their shields before them; those\r\nbehind held their shields before the front rank, and those who were\r\nbehind the second rank did the same. This form, which very much\r\nresembles a roof,[417] presents a theatrical appearance, and is the\r\nsafest of bulwarks against the arrows, which thus glance off. But the\r\nParthians, who thought that the Romans bending on one knee was a sign of\r\nexhaustion and fatigue, laid aside their bows, and grasping their spears\r\nby the middle, came to close quarters. But the Romans with one shout all\r\nat once sprang up, and pushing with their javelins which they held in\r\ntheir hands, killed the foremost and put all the rest to flight. This\r\ntook place also on the following days, the Romans making only small way.\r\nFamine also attacked the army, which could get little grain and that\r\nwith fighting, and they had few implements for grinding; for the greater\r\npart were left behind, owing to some of the beasts dying, and others\r\nbeing employed in carrying the sick and wounded. It is said that an\r\nAttic choenix[418] of wheat was sold for fifty drachmæ; and they sold\r\nbarley loaves for their weight in silver. Then they betook themselves to\r\nvegetables and roots; but they found few of the kind that they were\r\naccustomed to, and being compelled to make trial of what they had never\r\ntasted before, they ate of one herb that caused madness and then death.\r\nFor he who had eaten of it recollected nothing, and understood nothing,\r\nand busied himself about nothing except one sole thing, which was to\r\nmove and turn every stone, as if he were doing something of great\r\nimportance. The plain was full of men stooping to the ground and digging\r\nround stones and moving them; and finally they vomited bile and died,\r\nfor wine, which was the only remedy, failed them. As many were dying and\r\nthe Parthians did not desist from their attack, they say that Antonius\r\noften cried out \"O the ten thousand!\"[419] whereby he expressed his\r\nadmiration of the ten thousand, that though they marched even a greater\r\ndistance, from Babylonia, and fought with many more enemies, yet they\r\nmade good their retreat.\r\n\r\nXLVI. The Parthians, not being able to break through the Roman army nor\r\nyet to separate their ranks, and being already often defeated and put to\r\nflight, again mingled in a friendly way with those who went out for\r\ngrass or corn, and pointing to the strings of their bows which were\r\nunstrung, said, that they were going back and this was the end of their\r\nattack; but that a few of the Medes would follow still one or two days'\r\njourney without annoying them at all, and for the purpose of protecting\r\nthe more distant villages. To these words were added embraces and signs\r\nof friendship, so that the Romans were again of good cheer; and Antonius\r\nhearing this resolved to keep nearer to the plains, as the road through\r\nthe mountains was said to be waterless. While he was intending to do\r\nthis, there came to the camp a man from the enemy, named Mithridates, a\r\ncousin of Monæses, of him who had been with Antonius and had received\r\nthe three cities as a present. And he asked for some one to come near to\r\nhim who could speak the Parthian or the Syrian language. Alexander of\r\nAntioch came to him, and he was an intimate friend of Antonius,\r\nwhereupon Mithridates, saying who he was, and intimating that they must\r\nthank Monæses for what he was going to say, asked Alexander, if he saw\r\nin the distance a continuous range of lofty mountains. On Alexander\r\nsaying that he saw them, he replied, \"Under those mountains the\r\nParthians with all their forces lie in ambush for you. For the great\r\nplains border on these mountains, and they expect that you will be\r\ndeceived by them and will turn in that direction and leave the road\r\nthrough the mountains. The way over the mountains is attended with\r\nthirst and labour to which you are accustomed, but if Antonius goes by\r\nthe plain, let him be assured that the fate of Crassus awaits him.\"\r\n\r\nXLVII. Having said this, he went away; and Antonius, who was troubled at\r\nthese words, called together his friends and the Mardian who was their\r\nguide, and had exactly the same opinion. For even if there were no\r\nenemy, he knew that the want of roads in the plains and the mistakes in\r\nthe track which they might make there were matters of hazard and\r\ndifficulty; but he declared that the road over the mountains presented\r\nno other risk than the want of water for a single day. Accordingly\r\nAntonius turned aside and led his army by this route by night, having\r\ngiven orders to the men to take water with them. But the greater part\r\nhad no vessels, and accordingly they filled their helmets with water and\r\ncarried them, and others took it in skins. As soon as Antonius began to\r\nadvance, the Parthians had intelligence of it, and contrary to their\r\ncustom they commenced the pursuit while it was still night. Just as the\r\nsun was rising, they came up with the rear, which was in weak condition\r\nthrough want of sleep and fatigue: for they had accomplished two hundred\r\nand forty stadia in the night; and the enemy coming upon them so\r\nsuddenly when they did not expect it, dispirited them. The contest\r\nincreased their thirst, for they still advanced while they were\r\ndefending themselves. Those who were in the first ranks, as they were\r\nmarching onwards, came to a river,[420] the water of which was cool and\r\npellucid, but salt and of a medicinal nature; and this water, when drank\r\nof immoderately, caused pains with purging and augmentation of the\r\nthirst: and though the Mardian had warned them of this, the soldiers\r\nnevertheless forced away those who tried to hinder them and drank of the\r\nwater. Antonius went round to the men and prayed them to hold out for a\r\nshort time, and he said there was another river not far off, and besides\r\nthis, the rest of the route was impracticable for horses and rough, so\r\nthat the enemy must certainly turn back. At the same time he summoned\r\nthose who were engaged in the fight and gave the signal for pitching the\r\ntents, that the soldiers might at least enjoy the shade a little.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. While then the tents were being fixed and the Parthians as usual\r\nwere immediately retiring, Mithridates came again, and upon Alexander\r\ngoing up to him, he advised him to put the army in motion after it had\r\nrested a little and to hasten to the river: for he said that the\r\nParthians would not cross it, but would follow up the pursuit as far as\r\nthe river. Alexander reported this to Antonius, and then brought out\r\nfrom him numerous gold cups and goblets, of which Mithridates taking as\r\nmany as he could hide in his dress, rode off. As it was still daylight,\r\nthey broke up their tents and advanced, without being annoyed by the\r\nenemy; but they made that night of all others the most painful and\r\nfrightful to themselves. For they killed and plundered those who had\r\nsilver or gold, and took the things that were carried by the beasts; and\r\nfinally falling upon the baggage of Antonius, they cut in pieces and\r\ndivided among them cups and costly tables, there being great disturbance\r\nand confusion through the whole army; for they thought that the enemy\r\nhad fallen upon them and that flight and dispersion had ensued, Antonius\r\ncalled one of the freedmen, who was on his guard, named Rhamnus, and\r\nbound him by oath when he gave him the order, to push his sword through\r\nhim and to cut off his head, that he might neither be taken alive by the\r\nenemy nor be recognised when dead. His friends broke out in tears, but\r\nthe Mardian encouraged Antonius by telling him that the river was near;\r\nfor a moist breeze blowing and a cooler air meeting them made their\r\nrespiration more agreeable; and he said that the time they had been on\r\nthe march confirmed his estimate of the distance, for what now remained\r\nof the night was not much. At the same time others reported that the\r\ndisorder was owing to their own wrongful deeds and rapacity. Accordingly\r\nAntonius, wishing to bring the army into order from their state of\r\ndisorder and confusion, commanded the signal to be given for pitching\r\nthe tents.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Day was now dawning, and as the army was beginning to get into\r\ncertain order and tranquillity, the arrows of the Parthians fell upon\r\nthe rear, and the signal for battle was given to the light-armed troops.\r\nThe heavy-armed troops again covering one another in like manner as\r\nbefore with their shields, stood the assault of the missiles, the enemy\r\nnot venturing to come near. The first ranks advancing slowly in this\r\nform, the river was seen; and Antonius drawing up his cavalry on the\r\nbanks in face of the enemy, took across the weak first. Those who were\r\nfighting were now relieved from apprehension, and had the opportunity of\r\ndrinking; for when the Parthians saw the river, they unstrung their bows\r\nand bade the Romans pass over in confidence, with great encomiums on\r\ntheir valour. Accordingly, they crossed, and recruited themselves\r\nquietly; and then they marched forwards, but yet not with full\r\nconfidence in the Parthians. On the sixth day after the last battle they\r\nreached the river Araxes,[421] which is the boundary between Media and\r\nArmenia. It appeared dangerous both for its depth and roughness, and a\r\nrumour went through the army that the enemy was in ambush there, and\r\nwould fall on them as they were crossing. When they had safely crossed\r\nand had set foot in Armenia, as if they had just got sight of that land\r\nfrom the sea, they saluted it and fell to shedding of tears and\r\nembracing of one another for joy. In their progress through a fertile\r\ncountry, during which they used everything freely after having suffered\r\ngreat want, they were subject to dropsical and bowel complaints.\r\n\r\nL. Antonius there made a review of his men, and he found that twenty\r\nthousand infantry and four thousand cavalry had perished; not all by the\r\nenemy, but above half by disease. They marched from Phraata\r\ntwenty-seven days, and they defeated the Parthians in eighteen battles;\r\nbut these victories brought neither strength nor security, because their\r\npursuits were short and ineffectual. And this mainly showed that it was\r\nArtavasdes[422] the Armenian who had deprived Antonius of the means of\r\nbringing that war to an end. For if the sixteen thousand horsemen whom\r\nhe drew out of Media had been present, who were equipped like the\r\nParthians, and were accustomed to fight against them, and if, while the\r\nRomans put to flight the fighting enemy, they had overtaken the\r\nfugitives, it would not have been in their power after a defeat to\r\nrecover themselves and venture again so often. All the army accordingly\r\nin passion endeavoured to incite Antonius to punish the Armenian. But\r\nAntonius upon considerations of prudence neither reproached him for his\r\ntreachery nor abated of his usual friendly behaviour and respect towards\r\nhim, being weak in numbers and in want of supplies. Afterwards, however,\r\nwhen he again broke into Armenia, and by many promises and invitations,\r\npersuaded Artavasdes to come into his hands, he seized him and took him\r\nin chains to Alexandria, where he was led in triumph. And herein chiefly\r\nhe offended the Romans, by giving to the Egyptians for the sake of\r\nCleopatra the honourable and solemn ceremonial of his native country.\r\nThis however took place later.\r\n\r\nLI. Antonius now pressed on his march, the winter having already set in\r\nwith severity, through incessant snow-storms, in which he lost eight\r\nthousand men on the route. Going down to the sea-coast with a very small\r\nbody of men, he waited for Cleopatra[423] in a place between Berytus and\r\nSidon, called \"White village\"; and as she was slow in coming, he became\r\nuneasy and restless, soon giving himself up to drinking and\r\nintoxication, but yet being unable to continue at table; for while his\r\ncompanions were drinking he would rise and often spring up to look out,\r\ntill Cleopatra arrived there by sea bringing a quantify of clothes and\r\nsupplies for the soldiers. There are some who say that Antonius received\r\nthe clothes from her, but that the money was his own, though he\r\ndistributed it as if it were a present to him from Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nLII. A quarrel arose between the king of the Medes and Phraortes[424]\r\nthe Parthian, which originated, as they say, about the Roman spoils, but\r\ncaused the Mede to have suspicions and fear of being deprived of his\r\ndominions. For this reason he sent to invite Antonius, and proffered to\r\njoin him in a war with his own forces. Antonius accordingly being put in\r\ngreat hope--for the only thing as he thought which had been the cause of\r\nhis failing to subdue the Parthians, his having gone against them\r\nwithout many horsemen and bowmen, he now saw was offered to him in such\r\nway that his part was rather to do a favour by accepting than to ask for\r\none--was preparing again to march into the upper country through Armenia,\r\nand after joining the Mede near the Araxes, then to recommence the war.\r\n\r\nLIII. At Rome Octavia[425] was desirous of going to Antonius, and Cæsar\r\ngave her permission; as the greater part say, not with the design of\r\npleasing her, but in order that if she were greatly insulted and\r\nneglected, he might have a specious pretext for the war. On reaching\r\nAthens she received letters from Antonius, in which he told her to stay\r\nthere, and informed her of his intended expedition. Though Octavia was\r\nannoyed, and saw that this was only a pretext, she wrote to him to ask\r\nto what place he would have the things sent which she was bringing to\r\nhim. And she was taking a great quantity of clothing for the army, many\r\nbeasts, and money and presents for his officers and friends; and besides\r\nthis, two thousand picked soldiers equipped as prætorian cohorts, with\r\nsplendid armour. A certain Niger, a friend of Antonius, who was sent by\r\nOctavia, reported this to him, and he added commendation of Octavia such\r\nas she merited and was just. But Cleopatra, seeing that Octavia was\r\nentering into a contest with her, and fearing that if to the dignity of\r\nher behaviour and the power of Cæsar she added the pleasure of social\r\nintercourse and attention to Antonius, she would be invincible and get\r\ncomplete mastery over her husband, pretended to be desperately in love\r\nwith Antonius, and she wasted her body by spare diet; and she put on the\r\nexpression of strong passion when he approached her, and of sorrow and\r\ndepression when he went away. She also contrived to be often seen in\r\ntears, which she would all at once wipe away and affect to conceal, as\r\nif she did not wish Antonius to observe it. She practised these arts\r\nwhile Antonius was preparing for his expedition from Syria against the\r\nMede.[426] Flatterers, too, who were busy in her behalf, abused Antonius\r\nas a hard and unfeeling man, who was causing the death of a woman who\r\nwas devoted to him alone. As to Octavia, she came to meet Antonius upon\r\nbusiness on her brother's account, and enjoyed the name of wife of\r\nAntonius; but Cleopatra, who was the queen of so many people, was only\r\ncalled the beloved of Antonius, and she did not shun nor disdain this\r\nname, so long as she could see Antonius and live with him; but if she\r\nwere driven away from him, she would not survive. At last they so melted\r\nand softened the man, that through fear that Cleopatra might destroy\r\nherself, he returned to Alexandria, and put off the Mede to the summer\r\nseason, though the affairs of Parthia were said to be in a state of\r\nanarchy. However, he went up into the country, and brought over the king\r\nto friendly terms, and after betrothing to one of his sons by Cleopatra\r\none of the daughters of the king, who was still a young child, he\r\nreturned, being now engaged in preparing for the civil war.\r\n\r\nLIV. When Octavia returned from Athens, as Cæsar conceived her to have\r\nbeen insulted, he ordered her to dwell in her own house. But she refused\r\nto leave her husband's house, and she advised her brother, if he had not\r\nfor other reasons determined to go to war with Antonius, to let her\r\naffairs alone, for it was not even decent to be said, that of the\r\ngreatest Imperators, one through love for a woman, and the other\r\nthrough jealousy, brought the Romans to civil war. This she said, and\r\nshe confirmed what she said by her acts; for she lived in her husband's\r\nhouse, just as if he were at home, and she took care of the children,\r\nboth her own and those of Fulvia, in an honourable and liberal way; she\r\nalso received the friends of Antonius who were sent to Rome to get\r\noffices or on business, and assisted them in obtaining from Cæsar what\r\nthey wanted. She thus unintentionally damaged Antonius, for he was hated\r\nfor wronging such a woman. He was also hated for the division which he\r\nmade among his children at Alexandria, which appeared to be\r\ntragical[427] and arrogant, and to show hatred of the Romans. For he\r\nfilled the gymnasium with a crowd, and caused to be placed on a tribunal\r\nof silver two thrones of gold, one for himself, and the other for\r\nCleopatra, and for the children other thrones which were lower; and\r\nfirst of all he declared Cleopatra Queen of Egypt and Cyprus and Libya\r\nand Coele Syria, with Cæsarion as co-regent, who was believed to be the\r\nson of the former Cæsar, who left Cleopatra pregnant; in the next place\r\nhe proclaimed his sons and Cleopatra's to be Kings of Kings; and to\r\nAlexander he gave Armenia, and Media, and Parthia, when he should have\r\nsubdued it, and to Ptolemæus he gave Phoenice and Syria and Cilicia. At\r\nthe same time also he led forth Alexander, dressed in a Median vest with\r\na tiara and cittaris[428] upright, and Ptolemæus in boots, and a\r\nchlamys, and a causia with a diadem attached to it; for this was the\r\ndress of the kings who followed Alexander, and the other was the dress\r\nof the Medes and Armenians. After the children had embraced their\r\nparents, a guard of Armenians was placed around the one, and of\r\nMacedonians around the other. Cleopatra, both on that occasion and on\r\nother occasions when she went out before the people, used to put on a\r\ndress sacred to Isis, different from her ordinary dress, and she was\r\ncalled the new Isis.\r\n\r\nLV. By bringing these matters before the Senate, and often complaining\r\nof them before the people, Cæsar excited the multitude against Antonius.\r\nAntonius also sent and made recriminations against Cæsar. The chief\r\ncharges which Antonius made against him were, in the first place, that\r\nthough he had taken Sicily from Pompeius, he did not give him a part of\r\nthe island; second, that Cæsar had borrowed ships from him for the war\r\nand had kept them; third, that after ejecting his colleague Lepidus from\r\nhis authority and degrading him, Cæsar kept the army and territory and\r\nrevenues that were assigned to Lepidus;[429] and, finally, that he had\r\ndistributed nearly all Italy in allotments among his own soldiers, and\r\nhad left nothing for the soldiers of Antonius. To these charges Cæsar\r\nreplied, that he had deprived Lepidus of his authority because he was\r\nabusing it, and as to what he had acquired in war, he would share it\r\nwith Antonius, when Antonius should share Armenia with him. He further\r\nsaid that the soldiers of Antonius had no claim to any share of Italy,\r\nfor that they had Media and Parthia, which they had added to the Roman\r\npossessions by their brave conduct in war under their Imperator.\r\n\r\nLVI. Antonius heard of this while he was tarrying in Armenia; and he\r\nimmediately gave orders to Canidius to take sixteen legions and to go\r\ndown to the sea. Himself taking Cleopatra with him went to Ephesus. Here\r\nthe navy collected from all quarters, eight hundred ships, including\r\nmerchant vessels, of which Cleopatra furnished two hundred, and twenty\r\nthousand talents and supplies for the war for all the army. Antonius,\r\nbeing persuaded by Domitius and some others, told Cleopatra to sail to\r\nEgypt and there to wait the result of the war. But as Cleopatra feared\r\nthat there would again be a reconciliation through Octavia, she\r\npersuaded Canidius by a large bribe to speak to Antonius about her, and\r\nto say, that it was neither just for a woman to be kept away from the\r\nwar, who supplied so many large contributions, nor was it to the\r\ninterest of Antonius to dispirit the Egyptians, who composed a large\r\npart of the naval force; and besides this, he did not see to which of\r\nthe kings who joined the expedition Cleopatra was inferior in\r\nunderstanding, she who for a long time by herself had governed so large\r\na kingdom, and had long enjoyed his company, and had learned to manage\r\ngreat affairs. These arguments prevailed, for it was fated that all the\r\npower should come into Cæsar's hands; and after the forces had come\r\ntogether, they sailed to Samos and enjoyed themselves there. For as\r\norders had been given to kings and rulers and tetrarchs and nations and\r\nall the cities between Syria and the Mæotis and Armenia and the\r\nIllyrians[430] to send and bring their supplies for the war, so all the\r\npersons who assisted at theatrical entertainments were required to meet\r\nAntonius at Samos; and while nearly all the world around was lamenting\r\nand groaning, one island for many days resounded with pipes and stringed\r\ninstruments, and the theatres were filled and the chori were vying with\r\none another. Every city also joined in the celebration by sending an ox,\r\nand kings rivalled one another in giving entertainments and presents. So\r\nthat it went abroad and was said, how will persons behave in the\r\nrejoicings after a victory, who make such costly banquets to celebrate\r\nthe preparations for war?\r\n\r\nLVII. After these amusements were over, Antonius gave to the theatrical\r\ncompany Priene for their dwelling; and sailing to Athens he again gave\r\nhimself up to pleasure and theatres. Cleopatra, who was jealous of the\r\nhonours that had been paid to Octavia in the city, for Octavia was very\r\nmuch beloved by the Athenians, attempted to gain the popular favour by\r\nmany acts of liberality. The Athenians after voting to her honorable\r\ndistinctions, sent a deputation to her residence to carry the record of\r\nthe vote, and Antonius was one of them, as being an Athenian citizen;\r\nand coming before her he went through an harangue on behalf of the\r\ncity. He sent persons to Rome to eject Octavia from his house; and it is\r\nsaid that when she left it, she took all the children of Antonius with\r\nher except the eldest of the children by Fulvia, for he was with his\r\nfather, and that she wept and lamented that she too would be considered\r\none of the causes of the war. And the Romans pitied not her, but they\r\npitied Antonius, and those chiefly who had seen Cleopatra, a woman who\r\nhad not the advantage over Octavia either in beauty or in youth.\r\n\r\nLVIII. Cæsar was alarmed when he heard of the rapidity and the greatness\r\nof the preparation[431] of Antonius, lest he should be compelled to come\r\nto a decisive battle during that summer. For he was deficient in many\r\nthings, and the exaction of taxes vexed people; for the free men, being\r\ncompelled to contribute a fourth[432] of their income, and the class of\r\nfreedmen to contribute an eighth part of their property, cried out\r\nagainst Cæsar, and tumults arising from these causes prevailed over all\r\nItaly. Accordingly the delay in the war is reckoned among the greatest\r\nfaults of Antonius; for it gave time to Cæsar to make preparation, and\r\nit put an end to the disturbances among the people; for while the money\r\nwas being exacted from them they were irritated, but when it had been\r\nexacted and they had paid it they remained quiet.[433] Titius and\r\nPlancus, friends of Antonius and men of consular rank, being insulted by\r\nCleopatra, for they made the most opposition to her joining the\r\nexpedition, escaped to Cæsar, and they gave him information about the\r\nwill of Antonius, as they were acquainted with the contents of it. The\r\nwill was placed with the Vestal Virgins,[434] and when Cæsar asked for\r\nit, they would not give it to him, but they told him, if he wished to\r\nhave it, to come and take it himself. And he did go and take it; and\r\nfirst of all he read it over by himself, and marked certain passages\r\nwhich furnished ready matter of accusation; in the next place he\r\nassembled the Senate and read the will, to the dissatisfaction of the\r\ngreater part; for they considered it to be altogether unusual and a hard\r\nmatter for a man to be called to account in his lifetime for what he\r\nwished to be done after his death. Cæsar dwelt most on that part of the\r\nwill which related to the interment; for Antonius directed that his\r\nbody, even if he should die in Rome, should be carried in procession\r\nthrough the Forum and sent to Alexandria to Cleopatra. Calvisius, an\r\nintimate friend of Cæsar, brought forward also these charges against\r\nAntonius in reference to Cleopatra: that he had given her the\r\nlibraries[435] from Pergamum, in which there were two hundred thousand\r\nsingle books; and that at an entertainment in the presence of many\r\npeople he stood up and rubbed her feet[436] in compliance with a certain\r\narrangement and agreement; and that he allowed the Ephesians in his\r\npresence to salute Cleopatra as mistress; and that frequently when he\r\nwas administering justice to tetrarchs and kings on his tribunal, he\r\nwould receive from her love-billets written on onyx or crystal and read\r\nthem. Furnius[437] also, who was a man of distinction and the most\r\npowerful orator among the Romans, said that Cleopatra was being carried\r\nin a litter through the Forum, and that Antonius when he saw her, sprung\r\nup and left the judgment-seat and accompanied her hanging on the litter.\r\n\r\nLIX. In most of these matters Calvisius[438] was supposed to be lying.\r\nBut the friends of Antonius going about in Rome entreated the people\r\nfor his sake, and they sent Geminius, one of their body, to entreat\r\nAntonius not to be regardless about being deprived of his authority by a\r\nvote and declared an enemy of the Romans. Geminius having sailed to\r\nGreece became suspected by Cleopatra of acting on the behalf of Octavia,\r\nand, though he was continually ridiculed at supper and insulted by\r\nhaving unsuitable places at the feast assigned to him, he submitted to\r\nthis and waited for an opportunity of an interview; and when he was told\r\nat supper to say what he had come about, he replied that all his\r\ncommunication was to be made when he was sober, except one thing, which\r\nhe knew whether he was sober or drunk; and it was this, that all would\r\nbe well if Cleopatra would go off to Egypt. Antonius was irritated at\r\nthis, but Cleopatra said, \"You have done well, Geminius, in having\r\nconfessed the truth without tortures.\" After a few days accordingly\r\nGeminius made his escape to Rome. The flatterers of Cleopatra drove away\r\nalso many of the other friends of Antonius, who could not endure their\r\nexcesses over wine and their coarse behaviour; and among these were\r\nMarcus Silanus and Dellius the historian. Dellius says that he was also\r\nafraid of some design from Cleopatra, of which he had been informed by\r\nGlaucus the physician. He had offended Cleopatra at supper by saying\r\nthat they had to drink vinegar, while Sarmentus[439] at Rome was\r\ndrinking Falernian. Now Sarmentus was a youth, one of Cæsar's\r\nfavourites, such as the Romans call Deliciæ.\r\n\r\nLX. When Cæsar had made preparation sufficient, he got a vote passed for\r\nwar against Cleopatra[440] and for depriving Antonius of the authority\r\nwhich he had surrendered to Cleopatra. Cæsar also said that Antonius,\r\nowing to draughts that had been administered to him, was not in his\r\nsenses, and those whom the Romans had to fight against were Mardion the\r\neunuch, and Potheinus, and Iras the tire-woman of Cleopatra, and\r\nCharmion, by whom all the chief matters of administration were directed.\r\nThese signs, it is said, happened before the war. Pisaurum,[441] a city\r\nthat had been colonised by Antonius, which was situated near the\r\nAdriatic, was swallowed up by the opening of chasms in the earth. From\r\none of the stone statues of Antonius at Alba sweat oozed for many days,\r\nand it did not cease, though there were persons who wiped it off. While\r\nhe was staying at Patræ, the Herakleium was destroyed by lightning; at\r\nAthens the Dionysius, one of the figures in the Battle of the\r\nGiants,[442] was blown down by the winds and carried into the theatre.\r\nNow Antonius claimed kinship with Hercules by descent and with Dionysius\r\nby imitating his manner of life, as it has been said, and he was called\r\nyoung Dionysius. The same tempest also fell on the colossal statues of\r\nEumenes and Attalus, on which the name of Antonius had been inscribed,\r\nand threw them down alone out of a large number. The admiral's ship of\r\nCleopatra was called Antonias, and a bad omen appeared as to it: some\r\nswallows had made their nest under the stern, but other swallows\r\nattacked and drove them out and destroyed the young.\r\n\r\nLXI. They were now coming together for the war; and the fighting ships\r\nof Antonius were not fewer than five hundred, among which were many\r\nvessels of eight and ten banks of oars fitted out in proud and pompous\r\nstyle; of the land forces there were one hundred thousand, and twelve\r\nthousand horsemen. There were on his side of subject kings, Bocchus the\r\nking of the Libyans, and Tarcondemus the king of Upper Cilicia, and\r\nArchelaus, king of Cappadocia, and Philadelphus of Paphlagonia, and\r\nMithridates of Commagene, and Sadalas of Thrace. These were with him.\r\nFrom Pontus Polemon sent a force, and Malchus from Arabia, and Herodes,\r\nthe Jew; and besides these, Amyntas, the king of the Lycaonians and\r\nGalatians.[443] There was also help sent from the king of the Medes.\r\nCæsar had two hundred and fifty ships of war, and eighty thousand\r\ninfantry, and about the same number of horsemen as the enemy. The\r\ndominion of Antonius extended over the country from the Euphrates to the\r\nIonian sea and the Illyrians; and that of Cæsar from the Illyrians over\r\nthe country that reached to the Western Ocean, and over the country from\r\nthe ocean to the Tuscan and Sicilian sea. Of Libya Cæsar had the part\r\nwhich extended opposite to Italy and Gaul and Iberia as far as the\r\npillars of Hercules; and Antonius had the part from Cyrene to Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nLXII. Antonius was so mere an appendage to Cleopatra that though he had\r\na great superiority in land forces, he wished the decision of the affair\r\nto depend on the navy, to please Cleopatra: and this, though he saw that\r\nthrough want of a crew, men were being seized by the trierarchs out of\r\nGreece, which had indeed suffered much, travellers, ass-drivers,\r\nreapers, youths, and that even by these means the ships were not manned,\r\nbut the greater part were deficient and were ill manoeuvred. Cæsar's navy\r\nconsisted of ships not built to a great height nor yet for the purpose\r\nof making a show, but adapted for easy and quick movement and well\r\nmanned; and he kept his fleet together in Tarentum and Brundusium, and\r\nsent to Antonius to ask him not to waste the time, but to come with his\r\nforces, and that he would provide his armament with naval stations free\r\nfrom all hindrance, and harbours, and that he would retreat with his\r\nland forces a day's journey for a horseman from the sea, until Antonius\r\nhad safely landed and encamped. Antonius replied in like strain to this\r\nbragging language by challenging Cæsar to single combat, though he was\r\nolder than Cæsar; and if Cæsar declined this, he proposed that they\r\nshould decide the matter with their armies at Pharsalus, as Cæsar and\r\nPompeius had done before. While Antonius was taking his station near\r\nActium,[444] where Nicopolis is now built, Cæsar contrived to cross the\r\nIonian sea and to get possession of a place in Epirus, called Torune;\r\nand as the friends of Antonius were uneasy, because their land force had\r\nnot yet come up, Cleopatra, jesting, said, \"What is the harm if Cæsar is\r\nsitting by a torune?\"[445]\r\n\r\nLXIII. At daybreak the advance of the enemy's fleet alarmed Antonius,\r\nlest they should seize the ships which were without crews, and\r\naccordingly he armed the rowers and placed them on the decks to make a\r\nshow, and raising the ships' oars and making them ready for plying, he\r\nkept his ships on each side in the channel near Actium, prow to prow, as\r\nif they were fit to be put in motion and prepared to fight. Cæsar, being\r\nfrustrated by this manoeuvre, retired. Antonius also by some well\r\ncontrived works shut in the water and deprived his enemies of it; and\r\nthe surrounding spots had only little water, and that was bad. He\r\nbehaved with magnanimity to Domitius also, and contrary to the judgment\r\nof Cleopatra. Domitius, who was already suffering from fever, got into a\r\nsmall boat and went over to Cæsar, on which Antonius, though much\r\nannoyed, sent him all his baggage together with his friends and slaves.\r\nDomitius indeed, as if he were repenting after the discovery of his\r\nfaithlessness and treachery, died immediately. There were also\r\ndefections among the kings, for Amyntas and Deiotarus went over to\r\nCæsar. Now as the navy was in all things unlucky and always too late to\r\ngive any help, Antonius was again compelled to turn his thoughts to his\r\nland forces. Canidius also, who commanded the land forces, changed his\r\nopinion at the sight of the danger, and he advised Antonius to send\r\nCleopatra away, and to retreat to Thrace or Macedonia, and then to\r\ndecide the matter by a battle. For Dicomes, the king of the Getæ,\r\npromised to help him with a large force; and Canidius urged that there\r\nwould be no disgrace, if they should give up the sea to Cæsar, who had\r\nbeen disciplined in the Sicilian war, but it would be a strange thing if\r\nAntonius, who was excellently versed in military operations, should not\r\navail himself of his strength and his resources of so many heavy-armed\r\nsoldiers, and should instead thereof distribute his troops among\r\nvessels and fritter them away. Notwithstanding this the advice of\r\nCleopatra prevailed that the war should be decided by a naval battle,\r\nthough she was already contemplating flight and making arrangements for\r\nher own position, not with a view to contribute to the victory, but to\r\nhave the best place to retreat from if their cause should be ruined. Now\r\nthere were long lines which extended from the camp to the naval station,\r\nand Antonius was accustomed to pass without suspecting any danger; and\r\nas a slave of Cæsar told him that it would be possible to seize Antonius\r\nas he went down through the lines, Cæsar sent men to lie in ambush for\r\nhim. They came so near accomplishing their purpose as this, that by\r\nrising up too soon they seized the man who was advancing in front of\r\nAntonius; and Antonius escaped with difficulty by running.\r\n\r\nLXIV. When it had been resolved to make a sea fight, Antonius burned all\r\nthe Egyptian ships except sixty; but he manned the best and largest,\r\nfrom three to ten banks of oars, with twenty thousand heavy-armed\r\nsoldiers and two thousand bowmen. Hereupon it is said that one of the\r\ncenturions, who had already fought many battles for Antonius and was\r\ncovered with wounds, wept as Antonius was passing by, and said;\r\n\"Imperator, why do you distrust these wounds or this sword and rest your\r\nhopes in miserable logs of wood? Let Egyptians and Phoenicians fight on\r\nsea, but give us land, on which we are accustomed to stand and to die or\r\nto vanquish our enemies.\" Without making any reply, but merely by a\r\nmotion of his hand and the expression of his countenance encouraging the\r\nman to be of good cheer, Antonius passed by, without however having any\r\ngood hopes himself, inasmuch as when the masters of the vessels were\r\ndesirous to leave the sails behind, he ordered them to be put on board\r\nand taken with them, observing that not a single fugitive of the enemy\r\nshould be allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nLXV.[446] Now on that day and the three following days the sea was\r\nagitated by a strong wind which prevented an engagement, but on the\r\nfifth, there being no wind and the sea being quite calm, they came to an\r\nengagement. Antonius and Publicola commanded the right wing, and Coelius\r\nthe left; and in the centre were Marcus Octavius and Marcus Insteius.\r\nCæsar placed Agrippa on the left, and reserved the right wing for\r\nhimself. Canidius drew up the army of Antonius, and Taurus that of Cæsar\r\non the shore, and remained without moving. As to the two\r\ncommanders-in-chief, Antonius visited all his vessels in a row-boat and\r\nexhorted his soldiers to trust to the weight of their ships and to fight\r\nas if they were on land, without changing their position, and he urged\r\nthe masters of the ships to receive the shock of the enemy with their\r\nvessels as if they were quietly at anchor, and to avoid the difficult\r\nspots about the entrance of the bay: and Cæsar, it is said, while it was\r\nstill dark, left his tent, and as he was going round to the ships, he\r\nmet a man driving an ass, who being asked his name and knowing Cæsar,\r\nreplied, \"My name is Goodluck, and my ass's name is Victor.\" For this\r\nreason when Cæsar afterwards ornamented the place with the beaks of\r\nships, he set up a bronze figure of an ass and a man. After observing\r\nthe arrangement of the other part of his fleet, he went in a boat to the\r\nright wing and was surprised to see the enemy resting quietly in the\r\nstraits; for the vessels had the appearance of being moored at their\r\nanchors; and as he was for a long time convinced of this, he kept his\r\nown ships at the distance of eight stadia from the enemy. It was now the\r\nsixth hour, and a wind beginning to rise from the sea, the soldiers of\r\nAntonius were impatient at the delay, and, trusting to the height and\r\nmagnitude of their ships as making them unassailable, they put the left\r\nwing in motion. Cæsar, delighted to see this, ordered his right wing to\r\nrow backwards with the design of drawing the enemy still further out of\r\nthe gulf and the straits, and by surrounding them with his own light\r\nvessels to come to close quarters with the enemy's ships, which, owing\r\nto their size and the insufficiency of their crews, were cumbersome and\r\nslow.\r\n\r\nLXVI. Though the two fleets were beginning to come together, they did\r\nnot drive the ships against, nor strive to crush one another, for the\r\nships of Antonius, owing to their weight, were unable to move forwards\r\nwith any force, which mainly gives effect to the blows of the beaks, and\r\nthose of Cæsar not only avoided meeting front to front the strong and\r\nrough brass work of the enemy, but did not even venture to strike\r\nagainst them on the flank. For the beaks would easily have been broken\r\noff by coming in contact with the hulls[447] of the enemy's vessels,\r\nwhich were protected by large square pieces of timber fastened to one\r\nanother with iron. The battle therefore was like a land fight, or, to\r\nspeak more exactly, like the assailing of a fortress; for three and four\r\nof Cæsar's ships at the same time were engaged about one of the ships of\r\nAntonius, and the men fought with light shields and spears and poles and\r\nfiery missiles; the soldiers of Antonius assailed them also with\r\ncatapults from wooden towers. While Agrippa was extending the left wing\r\nwith a view to surround the enemy, Publicola, being compelled to advance\r\nto meet him, was separated from the centre, which fell into confusion,\r\nand was also closely engaged with Arruntius. While the sea fight was\r\nstill undecided and equally favourable to both sides, all at once the\r\nsixty ships of Cleopatra were seen raising their sails for the purpose\r\nof making off, and flying through the centre of the combatants; for they\r\nwere stationed behind the large vessels and they caused confusion by\r\nmaking their way through them. The enemy looked on with wonder, seeing\r\nthem take advantage of the wind and shape their course towards the\r\nPeloponnesus. On this occasion Antonius clearly showed that he was not\r\ngoverned by the considerations that befit either a commander or a man,\r\nor even by his own judgment, but, as some one observed in jest, that the\r\nsoul of the lover lives in another person's body, so was he dragged\r\nalong by the woman as if he had grown to her and moved together with\r\nher. For no sooner did he see her ship sailing away, than, forgetting\r\neverything, and deserting and skulking away from those who were fighting\r\nand dying in his cause, he got into a five-oared galley with only Alexas\r\nthe Syrian and Skellius to attend him, and followed after her who had\r\nalready ruined him and was destined to complete his ruin.\r\n\r\nLXVII. Cleopatra, having recognised the vessel of Antonius, raised a\r\nsignal; and Antonius accordingly, coming up to her and being taken into\r\nher ship, neither saw Cleopatra nor was seen by her, but advancing close\r\nto the prow he sat down by himself in silence holding his head with both\r\nhis hands. In the meantime there were seen Liburnian ships[448] from\r\nCæsar's fleet in pursuit; but Antonius, by ordering his men to turn his\r\nvessel's head towards them, kept them all in check, except the ship of\r\nEurykles, the Lacedæmonian, who proudly pressed on, brandishing a spear\r\non the deck, as if to hurl it at Antonius. Standing on the prow of his\r\nvessel Antonius asked who it was that was pursuing Antonius? The reply\r\nwas, \"I am Eurykles, the son of Lachares, and by the help of Cæsar's\r\nfortune I am avenging my father's death.\" Now Lachares had been beheaded\r\nby Antonius in consequence of being involved in a charge of robbery.\r\nHowever Eurykles did not fall upon the ship of Antonius, but he dashed\r\nagainst the other of the admiral-ships (for there were two) with the\r\nbrazen beak, and made it spin round, and as the ship fell off from its\r\ncourse he took it, and also another ship which contained costly vessels\r\nfor table use. When this assailant had retired, Antonius, again settling\r\ndown in the same posture, remained without moving, and, after spending\r\nthree days at the prow by himself, either because of his passion or that\r\nhe was ashamed to see Cleopatra, he put in at Tænarus.[449] Here the\r\nwomen who were in attendance on Cleopatra first of all brought them to\r\nspeak to one another, and next they persuaded them to sup and sleep\r\ntogether. And already not a few of the transport ships and some of their\r\nfriends after the defeat began to collect around them; and they brought\r\nintelligence of the destruction of the navy, but they supposed that the\r\narmy still kept together. Antonius sent messengers to Canidius with\r\norders for him to retreat quickly through Macedonia with his army into\r\nAsia; and as it was his intention to cross over from Tænarus to Libya,\r\nhe selected one of the store-ships which conveyed much money and many\r\nroyal utensils in silver and in gold of great value, and gave them to\r\nhis friends, telling them to divide the things among them and to look\r\nafter their safety. As they refused and wept, he comforted them with\r\nmuch affection and kindness, and by his entreaties induced them to\r\ndepart; and he wrote to Theophilus, his steward in Corinth, to provide\r\nfor the safety of the men and to conceal them until they should be able\r\nto make their peace with Cæsar. This Theophilus was the father of\r\nHipparchus, who had the greatest influence with Antonius, and was the\r\nfirst of his freedmen who went over to Cæsar, and he afterwards lived in\r\nCorinth.\r\n\r\nLXVIII. Such was the condition of affairs with Antonius. At Actium the\r\nnaval force, after resisting Cæsar a long time and being very greatly\r\ndamaged by the heavy sea that set against them ahead, hardly gave up the\r\ncontest at the tenth hour. The dead were said not to be more than five\r\nthousand, but there were taken three hundred ships, as Cæsar has\r\nrecorded. There were not many who knew that Antonius had fled, and those\r\nwho heard of it could not at first believe that he had gone and left\r\nthem, when he had nineteen legions of unvanquished soldiers and twelve\r\nthousand horsemen; as if he had not often experienced fortune both ways,\r\nand were not exercised in the reverses of innumerable contests and wars.\r\nThe soldiers longed and expected to see him, hoping that he would soon\r\nshow himself from some quarter or other; and they displayed so much\r\nfidelity and courage that, even when his flight was well known, they\r\nkept together seven days and paid no regard to Cæsar's messages to them.\r\nBut at last, when their general Canidius had stolen away by night and\r\nleft the camp, being now deserted of all and betrayed by their\r\ncommanders, they went over to the conqueror. Upon this Cæsar[450] sailed\r\nto Athens, and having come to terms with the Greeks, he distributed the\r\ngrain that remained over after the war among the cities, which were in\r\na wretched condition and stripped of money, slaves and beasts of burden.\r\nNow my great-grandfather Nikarchus used to relate that all the\r\ncitizens[451] were compelled to carry down on their shoulders a certain\r\nquantity of wheat to the sea at Antikyra, and that their speed was\r\nquickened by the whip; they had carried, he said, one supply in this\r\nmanner, and had just measured out another and were about to set out,\r\nwhen news came that Antonius was defeated, and this saved the city; for\r\nthe agents and soldiers of Antonius immediately fled, and they divided\r\nthe corn among themselves.\r\n\r\nLXIX. When Antonius had reached the coast of Libya, and had sent\r\nCleopatra forwards to Egypt from Parætonium,[452] he had his fill of\r\nsolitude, wandering and rambling about with two friends, one a Greek,\r\nAristokrates, a rhetorician, and the other a Roman, Lucilius,[453] about\r\nwhom I have said elsewhere that at Philippi, in order that Brutus might\r\nescape, he had surrendered to the pursuers, pretending that he was\r\nBrutus, and his life being spared by Antonius on that account, he\r\nremained faithful to him and firm to the last critical times. When the\r\ngeneral[454] to whom he had intrusted the troops in Libya had caused\r\ntheir defection, Antonius made an effort to kill himself, but he was\r\nprevented by his friends and conveyed to Alexandria, where he found\r\nCleopatra contemplating a hazardous and great undertaking. The isthmus\r\nwhich separates the Red Sea from the sea of Egypt[455] and is\r\nconsidered to be the boundary between Asia and Libya, in the part where\r\nit is most contracted by the sea, and the width is least, is about three\r\nhundred stadia across; and here Cleopatra undertook to raise her ships\r\nout of the water and to drag them across the neck of land, and so\r\nbringing her ships into the Arabian gulf with much money and a large\r\nforce, to settle beyond the limits of Egypt and to escape from slavery\r\nand war. But as the Arabs of Petra[456] burnt the first ships which were\r\ndrawn up, and Antonius thought that the army at Actium still kept\r\ntogether, Cleopatra desisted from her design and guarded the approaches\r\nto Egypt. Antonius now leaving the city and the company of his friends,\r\nbuilt for himself a dwelling in the sea, near the Pharos,[457] by\r\nthrowing forward a mole into the water; and here he lived a fugitive\r\nfrom men, and he said that he was content with Timon's life and admired\r\nit, considering himself in like plight with Timon; for he too had been\r\nwronged by his friends and had experienced their ingratitude, and that\r\ntherefore he distrusted and disliked all men.\r\n\r\nLXX. Timon[458] was an Athenian, who lived about the time of the\r\nPeloponnesian war, as we may conclude from the plays of Aristophanes and\r\nPlato; for he is brought forward in them as peevish and misanthropical.\r\nThough he avoided and rejected all intercourse with men, yet he received\r\nin a friendly manner Alkibiades, who was a young audacious fellow, and\r\nshowed him great affection. And when Apemantus wondered at this and\r\nasked the reason, he said that he liked the young man because he knew\r\nthat he would be the cause of much ill to the Athenians. Apemantus was\r\nthe only person whom he sometimes allowed to approach him, because he\r\nwas like himself and imitated his mode of life. On one occasion, during\r\nthe festival called Choes,[459] when the two were feasting together,\r\nApemantus said, \"How delightful the entertainment is, Timon;\" \"Yes, if\r\nyou were not here,\" was the reply. It is said that when the Athenians\r\nwere in public assembly, Timon ascended the bema and called for silence,\r\nwhich raised great expectation on account of the unusual nature of the\r\ncircumstance: he then said, \"I have a small plot of building-ground, men\r\nof Athens, and there is a fig-tree growing on it, on which many of the\r\ncitizens have already hanged themselves. Now as I intend to build on the\r\nground, I wished to give public notice that, if any of you choose, they\r\nmay hang themselves before the fig-tree is cut down.\" After his death he\r\nwas buried at Halæ, near the sea; but the shore in front of the place\r\nslipped down, and the sea surrounding the tomb made it inaccessible and\r\nunapproachable. The inscription on the tomb was:\r\n\r\n   Here from the load of life released I lie:\r\n   Ask not my name: but take my curse, and die.\r\n\r\nAnd they say that he wrote this inscription during his lifetime; but\r\nthat which is commonly circulated as the inscription is by Callimachus:\r\n\r\n   Timon misanthropist I am. Away!\r\n   Curse, an' thou will't, but only do not stay.\r\n\r\nLXXI. These are a few things out of many about Timon. Canidius himself\r\nbrought intelligence to Antonius of the loss of his forces at Actium,\r\nand he heard that Herodes,[460] the Jew, who had certain legions and\r\ncohorts, had gone over to Cæsar, and that the rest of the princes in\r\nlike manner were revolting, and that none of his troops out of Egypt\r\nstill kept together. However, none of these things disturbed him; but,\r\nas if he gladly laid aside hope as he did care, he left that dwelling on\r\nthe sea, which he called Timoneium, and being taken by Cleopatra into\r\nthe palace, he turned the city to feasting and drinking and distribution\r\nof money, registering the son of Cleopatra and Cæsar among the young\r\nmen, and putting on Antyllus, his son by Fulvia,[461] the vest without\r\nthe purple hem, which marked the attainment of full age, on which\r\noccasion banquets and revellings and feasts engaged Alexandria for many\r\ndays. They themselves put an end to that famed company of the Inimitable\r\nLivers, and they formed another, not at all inferior to that in\r\nrefinement and luxury and expense, which they called the company of\r\nthose who would die together. For the friends of Antonius registered\r\nthemselves as intending to die together, and they continued enjoying\r\nthemselves in a succession of banquets. Cleopatra got together all kinds\r\nof deadly poisons, and she tried the painless character of each by\r\ngiving them to those who were in prison under sentence of death. When\r\nshe discovered that the quick poisons brought on a speedy death with\r\npain, and the less painful were not quick, she made trial of\r\nanimals,[462] which in her presence were set upon one another. And she\r\ndid this daily; and among nearly all she found that the bite of the asp\r\nalone brought on without spasms and groans a sleepy numbness and\r\ndrowsiness, with a gentle perspiration on the face, and dulling of the\r\nperceptive faculties, which were softly deprived of their power, and\r\nmade resistance to all attempts to awake and arouse them, as is the case\r\nwith those who are in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nLXXII. At the same time they sent also ambassadors to Cæsar into Asia,\r\nCleopatra requesting the dominion of Egypt for her children, and\r\nAntonius asking to be allowed to live as a private person at Athens, if\r\nhe could not be permitted to stay in Egypt. Through the want of friends\r\nand their distrust owing to the desertions, Euphronius, the instructor\r\nof the children, was sent on the embassy. For Alexas,[463] of Laodiceia,\r\nwho at Rome had become known to Antonius through Timagenes, and\r\npossessed most influence of all the Greeks, who also had been the most\r\nactive of the instruments of Cleopatra against Antonius, and had\r\noverthrown all the reflections which rose in his mind about Octavia, had\r\nbeen sent to King Herodes to keep him from changing; and having stayed\r\nthere and betrayed Antonius, he had the impudence to go into the\r\npresence of Cæsar, relying on Herodes. But Herodes helped him not, but\r\nbeing forthwith confined and carried in chains to his own country, he\r\nwas put to death there by order of Cæsar. Such was the penalty for his\r\ninfidelity that Alexas paid to Antonius in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nLXXIII. Cæsar would not listen to what was said on behalf of Antonius;\r\nbut as to Cleopatra, he replied that she should not fail to obtain\r\nanything that was reasonable if she would kill Antonius or drive him\r\naway. He also sent with the ambassadors of Antonius and Cleopatra one\r\nThyrsus,[464] a freedman of his, a man not devoid of judgment, nor, as\r\ncoming from a young general, one who would fail in persuasive address to\r\na haughty woman who was wonderfully proud of her beauty. This man,\r\nhaving longer interviews with Cleopatra than the rest, and being\r\nspecially honoured, caused Antonius to have suspicions, and he seized\r\nand whipped him; and he then sent him back to Cæsar with a letter to the\r\neffect that Thyrsus, by giving himself airs and by his insolent\r\nbehaviour, had irritated him, who was easily irritated by reason of his\r\nmisfortunes. \"But you,\" he said, \"if you do not like the thing, have my\r\nfreedman Hipparchus. Hang him up and whip him, that we may be on equal\r\nterms.\" Upon this Cleopatra, with the view of doing away with his cause\r\nof complaint and suspicions, paid more than usual court to Antonius: she\r\nkept her own birthday in a mean manner and a way suitable to her\r\ncondition, but she celebrated the birthday of Antonius with an excess of\r\nsplendour and cost, so that many of those who were invited to the feast\r\ncame poor and went away rich. Agrippa[465] in the meantime called Cæsar\r\nback, frequently writing to him from Rome, and urging that affairs there\r\nrequired his presence.\r\n\r\nLXXIV. Accordingly for the time the war was suspended; but when the\r\nwinter was over, Cæsar advanced through Syria and his generals through\r\nLibya. Pelusium was taken, and it was said that Seleukus gave it up, not\r\nwithout the consent of Cleopatra. But Cleopatra surrendered to Antonius\r\nthe wife and children of Seleukus to be put to death; and as she had a\r\ntomb and a monument constructed of unusual beauty and height, which she\r\nhad built close to the temple of Isis, she collected there the most\r\nprecious of the royal treasures, gold, silver, emeralds, pearls, ebony,\r\nivory, and cinnamon, and also a great quantity of fire-wood and tow; so\r\nthat Cæsar, being afraid about the money, lest Cleopatra becoming\r\ndesperate should destroy and burn the wealth, kept continually\r\nforwarding to her hopes of friendly treatment while he was advancing\r\nwith his army against the city. When Cæsar had taken his position near\r\nthe hippodrome, Antonius sallied forth and fought gallantly, and he put\r\nCæsar's cavalry to flight and pursued them to the camp. Elated with his\r\nvictory, he entered the palace and embraced Cleopatra in his armour, and\r\npresented to her one of the soldiers who had fought most bravely.\r\nCleopatra gave the soldier as a reward of his courage a golden\r\nbreastplate and a helmet. The man took them, and in the night deserted\r\nto Cæsar.\r\n\r\nLXXV. Again, Antonius sent to Cæsar and challenged him to single combat.\r\nCæsar replied that Antonius had many ways of dying, on which Antonius,\r\nreflecting that there was no better mode of death for him than in\r\nbattle, determined to try a land battle and a naval battle at the same\r\ntime. And at supper, it is said, he bade the slaves to pour out and\r\nfeast him cheerfully, for it was uncertain whether they would do that on\r\nthe morrow or would be serving other masters, while he should lie a\r\ncorpse and should be a nothing. Seeing that his friends shed tears at\r\nhis words, he said that he would not lead them out to a battle from\r\nwhich he would seek for himself a glorious death rather than safety and\r\nvictory. During this night, it is said, about the middle thereof, while\r\nthe city was quiet and depressed through fear and expectation of the\r\nfuture, all at once certain harmonious sounds from all kinds of\r\ninstruments were heard, and shouts of a crowd with Evoes[466] and\r\nsatyric leapings, as if some company of revellers not without noise were\r\ngoing out of the city; and the course of the procession seemed to be\r\nthrough the middle of the city to the gate leading outwards in the\r\ndirection of the enemy, and at this point the tumult made its way out,\r\nbeing loudest there. And those who reflected on the sign were of opinion\r\nthat the god to whom Antonius all along most likened himself and most\r\nclaimed kinship with was deserting him.\r\n\r\nLXXVI.[467] At daybreak Antonius posted his troops on the hills in front\r\nof the city, and watched his ships, which were put in motion and\r\nadvancing against those of the enemy; and as he expected to see\r\nsomething great done by them, he remained quiet. But when the men of\r\nAntonius came near, they saluted with their oars Cæsar's men, and as\r\nthey returned the salute, the men of Antonius changed sides, and the\r\nfleet becoming one by the junction of all the ships, sailed with the\r\nvessels' heads turned against the city. As soon as Antonius saw this, he\r\nwas deserted by the cavalry, who changed sides, and being defeated with\r\nhis infantry he retired into the city, crying out that he was betrayed\r\nby Cleopatra to those with whom he was warring on her account.\r\nCleopatra, fearing his anger and despair, fled to the tomb and let down\r\nthe folding doors which were strengthened with bars and bolts; and she\r\nsent persons to Antonius to inform him that she was dead. Antonius,\r\nbelieving the intelligence, said to himself, \"Why dost thou still delay,\r\nAntonius? fortune has taken away the sole remaining excuse for clinging\r\nto life.\" He then entered his chamber, and loosing his body armour and\r\ntaking it in pieces, he said: \"Cleopatra, I am not grieved at being\r\ndeprived of thee, for I shall soon come to the same place with thee; but\r\nI am grieved that I, such an Imperator, am shown to be inferior to a\r\nwoman in courage.\" Now Antonius had a faithful slave named Eros, whom he\r\nhad long before exhorted, if the necessity should arise, to kill him;\r\nand he now claimed the performance of the promise. Eros drew his sword\r\nand held it out as if he were going to strike his master, but he turned\r\naway his face and killed himself. As Eros fell at his master's feet\r\nAntonius said, \"Well done, Eros, though you are not able to do this for\r\nme, you teach me what I ought to do;\" and piercing himself through the\r\nbelly he threw himself on the bed. But the wound was not immediately\r\nmortal; and accordingly, as the flow of blood ceased when he lay down,\r\nhe came to himself and requested the bystanders to finish him. But they\r\nfled from the chamber while he was calling out and writhing in pain,\r\ntill Diomedes the secretary came from Cleopatra with orders to convey\r\nhim to her to the tomb.\r\n\r\nLXXVII.[468] When he learned that she was alive, he eagerly commanded\r\nhis slaves to take him up, and he was carried in their arms to the\r\ndoors of the chamber. Cleopatra did not open the doors, but she appeared\r\nat a window, from which she let down cords and ropes; and when the\r\nslaves below had fastened Antonius to them, she drew him up with the aid\r\nof the two women whom alone she had admitted into the tomb with her.\r\nThose who were present say that there never was a more piteous sight;\r\nfor stained with blood and struggling with death he was hauled up,\r\nstretching out his hands to her, while he was suspended in the air. For\r\nthe labour was not light for women, and Cleopatra with difficulty,\r\nholding with her hands and straining the muscles of her face, pulled up\r\nthe rope, while those who were below encouraged her and shared in her\r\nagony. When she had thus got him in and laid him down, she rent her\r\ngarments over him, and beating her breasts and scratching them with her\r\nhands, and wiping the blood off him with her face, she called him master\r\nand husband and Imperator; and she almost forgot her own misfortunes\r\nthrough pity for his. Antonius, stopping her lamentations, asked for\r\nwine to drink, whether it was that he was thirsty or that he expected to\r\nbe released more speedily. When he had drunk it, he advised her, if it\r\ncould be done with decency, to look after the preservation of her own\r\ninterests, and to trust to Procleius[469] most of the companions of\r\nCæsar; and not to lament him for his last reverses, but to think him\r\nhappy for the good things that he had obtained, having become the most\r\nillustrious of men and had the greatest power, and now not ignobly a\r\nRoman by a Roman vanquished.\r\n\r\nLXXVIII. Just as Antonius died, Procleius came from Cæsar;[470] for\r\nafter Antonius had wounded himself and was carried to Cleopatra,\r\nDerketæus, one of his guards, taking his dagger and concealing it,\r\nsecretly made his way from the palace, and running to Cæsar, was the\r\nfirst to report the death of Antonius, and he showed the blood-stained\r\ndagger. When Cæsar heard the news, he retired within his tent and wept\r\nfor a man who had been related to him by marriage, and his colleague in\r\ncommand, and his companion in many struggles and affairs. He then took\r\nthe letters that had passed between him and Antonius, and calling his\r\nfriends, read them, in order to show in what a reasonable and fair tone\r\nhe had written himself, and how arrogant and insolent Antonius had\r\nalways been in his answers. Upon this he sent Procleius with orders, if\r\npossible, above all things to secure Cleopatra alive; for he was afraid\r\nabout the money, and he thought it a great thing for the glory of his\r\ntriumph to lead her in the procession. However Cleopatra would not put\r\nherself in the hands of Procleius; but they talked together while he was\r\nstanding on the outside close to the building near a door on a level\r\nwith the ground, which was firmly secured, but allowed a passage for the\r\nvoice. In their conversation Cleopatra entreated that her children might\r\nhave the kingdom, and Procleius bade her be of good cheer and trust to\r\nCæsar in all things.\r\n\r\nLXXIX. After Procleius had inspected the place and reported to Cæsar,\r\nGallus[471] was sent to have another interview with her; and having come\r\nto the door he purposely prolonged the conversation. In the meantime\r\nProcleius applied a ladder and got through the window by which the women\r\ntook in Antonius; and he immediately went down with two slaves to the\r\ndoor at which Cleopatra stood with her attention directed to Gallus. One\r\nof the women who were shut up with Cleopatra called out, \"Wretched\r\nCleopatra, you are taken alive,\" on which she turned round, and seeing\r\nProcleius, attempted to stab herself, for she happened to have by her\r\nside a dagger such as robbers wear: but Procleius, quickly running up to\r\nher and holding her with both his hands, said, \"You wrong yourself,\r\nCleopatra, and Cæsar too by attempting to deprive him of the opportunity\r\nof a noble display of magnanimity and to fix on the mildest of\r\ncommanders the stigma of faithlessness and implacability.\" At the same\r\ntime he took away her dagger and shook her dress to see if she concealed\r\nany poison. There was also sent from Cæsar one of his freedmen,\r\nEpaphroditus, whose orders were to watch over her life with great care,\r\nbut as to the rest to give way in all things that would make her most\r\neasy and be most agreeable to her.\r\n\r\nLXXX. Cæsar entered the city talking with Areius the philosopher, and he\r\nhad given Areius[472] his right hand, that he might forthwith be\r\nconspicuous among the citizens and be admired on account of the special\r\nrespect that he received from Cæsar. Entering the gymnasium and\r\nascending a tribunal that was made for him, the people the while being\r\nterror-struck and falling down before him, he bade them get up, and he\r\nsaid that he acquitted the people of all blame, first on account of the\r\nfounder Alexander, second because he admired the beauty and magnitude of\r\nthe city, and third, to please his friend Areius. Such honour Areius\r\nobtained from Cæsar, and he got the pardon of many others; and among\r\nthem was Philostratus,[473] a man of all sophists the most competent to\r\nspeak on the sudden, but one who claimed to be of the Academy without\r\njust grounds. Wherefore Cæsar, who abominated his habits, would not\r\nlisten to his entreaties. But Philostratus, letting his white beard grow\r\nand putting on a dark vest, followed behind Areius, continually uttering\r\nthis verse:\r\n\r\n   Wise save the wise, if wise indeed they be.\r\n\r\nCæsar hearing of this, pardoned Philostratus, wishing rather to release\r\nAreius from odium than Philostratus from fear.\r\n\r\nLXXXI. Of the children of Antonius, Antyllus,[474] the son of Fulvia,\r\nwas given up by his pædagogus Theodorus and put to death; and when the\r\nsoldiers had cut off his head, the pædagogus took the most precious\r\nstone which he wore about his neck and sewed it in his belt; and though\r\nhe denied the fact, he was convicted of it and crucified. The children\r\nof Cleopatra were guarded together with those who had charge of them,\r\nand they had a liberal treatment; but as to Cæsarion, who was said to be\r\nCleopatra's son by Cæsar, her mother sent him to India with much\r\ntreasure by way of Ethiopia; but another pædagogus like Theodorus, named\r\nRhodon, persuaded him to return, saying that Cæsar invited him to take\r\nthe kingdom. While Cæsar was deliberating about Cæsarion, it is said\r\nthat Areius observed: \"Tis no good thing, a multitude of Cæsars.\"[475]\r\n\r\nLXXXII. Now Cæsar put Cæsarion to death after the death of Cleopatra.\r\nThough many asked for the body of Antonius to bury it, both kings and\r\ncommanders, Cæsar did not take it from Cleopatra, but it was interred by\r\nher own hands sumptuously and royally, and she received for that purpose\r\nall that she wished. In consequence of so much grief and pain, for her\r\nbreasts were inflamed by the blows that she had inflicted and were sore,\r\nand a fever coming on, she gladly availed herself of this pretext for\r\nabstaining from food and with the design of releasing herself from life\r\nwithout hindrance. There was a physician with whom she was familiar,\r\nOlympus, to whom she told the truth, and she had him for her adviser and\r\nassistant in accomplishing her death, as Olympus said in a history of\r\nthese transactions which he published. Cæsar suspecting her design,\r\nplied her with threats and alarms about her children, by which Cleopatra\r\nwas thrown down as by engines of war, and she gave up her body to be\r\ntreated and nourished as it was wished.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII. Cæsar himself came a few days after to see her and pacify\r\nher.[476] Cleopatra happened to be lying on a mattress meanly dressed,\r\nand as he entered she sprang up in a single vest and fell at his feet\r\nwith her head and face in the greatest disorder, her voice trembling and\r\nher eyes weakened by weeping. There were also visible many marks of the\r\nblows inflicted on her breast; and in fine her body seemed in no respect\r\nto be in better plight than her mind. Yet that charm and that saucy\r\nconfidence in her beauty were not completely extinguished, but, though\r\nshe was in such a condition, shone forth from within and showed\r\nthemselves in the expression of her countenance. When Cæsar had bid her\r\nlie down and had seated himself near her, she began to touch upon a kind\r\nof justification, and endeavoured to turn all that had happened upon\r\nnecessity and fear of Antonius; but as Cæsar on each point met her with\r\nan answer, being confuted, she all at once changed her manner to move\r\nhim by pity and by prayers, as a person would do who clung most closely\r\nto life. Finally she handed to him a list of all the treasures that she\r\nhad; and when Seleukus, one of her stewards, declared that she was\r\nhiding and secreting some things, she sprang up and laying hold of his\r\nhair, belaboured him with many blows on the face. As Cæsar smiled and\r\nstopped her, she said, \"But is it not scandalous, Cæsar, that you have\r\ncondescended to come to me and speak to me in my wretched condition, and\r\nmy slaves make it a matter of charge against me if I have reserved some\r\nfemale ornaments, not for myself forsooth, wretch that I am, but that I\r\nmay give a few things to Octavia and your wife Livia, and so through\r\ntheir means make you more favourable to me and more mild.\" Cæsar was\r\npleased with these words, being fully assured that she wished to live.\r\nAccordingly, after saying that he left these matters to her care and\r\nthat in everything else he would behave to her better than she expected,\r\nhe went away, thinking that he had deceived her; but he had deceived\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV. Now there was Cornelius Dolabella,[477] a youth of rank, and\r\none of the companions[478] of Cæsar. He was not without a certain liking\r\ntowards Cleopatra; and now, in order to gratify her request, he secretly\r\nsent and informed her that Cæsar himself was going to march with his\r\ntroops through Syria, and that he had determined to send off her with\r\nher children on the third day. On hearing this, Cleopatra first\r\nentreated Cæsar to permit her to pour libations on the tomb of Antonius;\r\nand when Cæsar permitted it, she went to the tomb, and embracing the\r\ncoffin in company with the women who were usually about her, said, \"Dear\r\nAntonius, I buried thee recently with hands still free, but now I pour\r\nout libations as a captive and so watched that I cannot either with\r\nblows or sorrow disfigure this body of mine now made a slave and\r\npreserved to form a part in the triumph over thee. But expect not other\r\nhonours or libations, for these are the last which Cleopatra brings.\r\nLiving, nothing kept us asunder, but there is a risk of our changing\r\nplaces in death; thou a Roman, lying buried here, and I, wretched woman,\r\nin Italy, getting only as much of thy country as will make me a grave.\r\nBut if indeed there is any help and power in the gods there (for the\r\ngods of this country have deserted us), do not deliver thy wife up\r\nalive, and let not thyself be triumphed over in me, but hide me here\r\nwith thee and bury thee with me; for though I have ten thousand ills,\r\nnot one of them is so great and grievous as this short time which I have\r\nlived apart from thee!\"\r\n\r\nLXXXV. After making this lamentation and crowning and embracing the\r\ncoffin, she ordered a bath to be prepared for her. After bathing, she\r\nlay down and enjoyed a splendid banquet. And there came one from the\r\ncountry bringing a basket; and on the guards asking what he brought, the\r\nman opened it, and taking off the leaves showed the vessel full of figs.\r\nThe soldiers admiring their beauty and size, the man smiled and told\r\nthem to take some, whereon, without having any suspicion, they bade him\r\ncarry them in. After feasting, Cleopatra took a tablet, which was\r\nalready written, and sent it sealed to Cæsar, and, causing all the rest\r\nof her attendants to withdraw except those two women, she closed the\r\ndoor. As soon as Cæsar[479] opened the tablet and found in it the\r\nprayers and lamentations of Cleopatra, who begged him to bury her with\r\nAntonius, he saw what had taken place. At first he was for setting out\r\nhimself to give help, but the next thing that he did was to send persons\r\nwith all speed to inquire. But the tragedy had been speedy; for, though\r\nthey ran thither and found the guards quite ignorant of everything, as\r\nsoon as they opened the door they saw Cleopatra lying dead on a golden\r\ncouch in royal attire. Of her two women, Iras was dying at her feet,\r\nand Charmion, already staggering and drooping her head, was arranging\r\nthe diadem on the forehead of Cleopatra. One of them saying in passion,\r\n\"A good deed this, Charmion;\" \"Yes, most goodly,\" she replied, \"and\r\nbefitting the descendant of so many kings.\" She spake not another word,\r\nbut fell there by the side of the couch.\r\n\r\nLXXXVI. Now it is said that the asp was brought with those figs and\r\nleaves, and was covered with them; for that Cleopatra had so ordered,\r\nthat the reptile might fasten on her body without her being aware of it.\r\nBut when she had taken up some of the figs and saw it, she said, \"Here\r\nthen it is,\" and baring her arm, she offered it to the serpent to bite.\r\nOthers say that the asp was kept in a water-pitcher, and that Cleopatra\r\ndrew it out with a golden distaff and irritated it till the reptile\r\nsprang upon her arm and clung to it. But the real truth nobody knows;\r\nfor it was also said that she carried poison about her in a hollow comb,\r\nwhich she concealed in her hair; however, no spots broke out on her\r\nbody, nor any other sign of poison. Nor yet was the reptile seen within\r\nthe palace; but some said that they observed certain marks of its trail\r\nnear the sea, in that part towards which the chamber looked and the\r\nwindows were. Some also say that the arm of Cleopatra was observed to\r\nhave two small indistinct punctures; and it seems that Cæsar believed\r\nthis, for in the triumph a figure of Cleopatra was carried with the asp\r\nclinging to her. Such is the way in which these events are told. Though\r\nCæsar was vexed at the death of Cleopatra, he admired her nobleness of\r\nmind, and he ordered the body to be interred with that of Antonius in\r\nsplendid and royal style. The women of Cleopatra also received\r\nhonourable interment by his orders. Cleopatra at the time of her death\r\nwas forty years of age save one, and she had reigned as queen\r\ntwo-and-twenty years, and governed together with Antonius more than\r\nfourteen. Antonius, according to some, was six years, according to\r\nothers, three years above fifty. Now the statues of Antonius were thrown\r\ndown, but those of Cleopatra remained standing, for Archibius, one of\r\nher friends, gave Cæsar two thousand talents that they might not share\r\nthe same fate as those of Antonius.\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. Antonius by his three wives left seven children, of whom\r\nAntyllus, the eldest, was the only one who was put to death by Cæsar;\r\nthe rest Octavia[480] took and brought them up with her own children.\r\nCleopatra, the daughter of Cleopatra, she married to Juba, the most\r\naccomplished of kings; and Antonius, the son of Fulvia, she raised so\r\nhigh that, while Agrippa held the first place in Cæsar's estimation, and\r\nthe sons of Livia the second, Antonius had and was considered to have\r\nthe third. Octavia had by Marcellus two daughters, and one son,\r\nMarcellus, whom Cæsar made both his son and son-in-law, and he gave one\r\nof the daughters to Agrippa. But as Marcellus died very soon after his\r\nmarriage, and it was not easy for Cæsar to choose from the rest of his\r\nfriends a son-in-law whom he could trust, Octavia proposed to him that\r\nAgrippa should take Cæsar's daughter and put away her daughter. Cæsar\r\nwas first persuaded and then Agrippa, whereupon Octavia took her own\r\ndaughter back and married her to Antonius; and Agrippa married Cæsar's\r\ndaughter. There were two daughters of Antonius and Octavia, of whom\r\nDomitius Ænobarbus took one to wife; and the other, who was famed for\r\nher virtues and her beauty, Antonia, was married to Drusus, the son of\r\nLivia, and step-son of Cæsar. From the marriage of Drusus and Antonia\r\ncame Germanicus and Claudius, of whom Claudius afterwards ruled; and of\r\nthe children of Germanicus, Caius, who ruled with distinction for no\r\nlong time, was destroyed together with his child and wife; and\r\nAgrippina, who had by Ænobarbus a son, Lucius Domitius, married Claudius\r\nCæsar; and Claudius adopting her son, named him Nero Germanicus. Nero,\r\nwho ruled in my time, slew his mother, and through his violence and\r\nmadness came very near subverting the supremacy of Rome, being the fifth\r\nfrom Antonius in the order of succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF DEMETRIUS AND ANTONIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Since, then, great changes of fortune took place in each of their\r\nlives, let us first consider their power and renown. The position of\r\nDemetrius was inherited and already made for him, as Antigonus was the\r\nmost powerful of the successors of Alexander, and, before Demetrius came\r\nof age, had overrun and conquered the greater part of Asia: while\r\nAntonius, whose father, though an excellent man, was no soldier, and\r\nleft him no renown, yet dared to seize upon the empire of Cæsar, with\r\nwhich he was in no way connected, and constituted himself the heir of\r\nwhat Cæsar had won by the sword. Starting as a mere private person, he\r\nraised himself to such a height of power as to be able to divide the\r\nworld into two, and to select and obtain the fairer half for his own,\r\nwhile, without his being even present, his lieutenants and agents\r\ninflicted several defeats upon the Parthians, and conquered all the\r\nnations of Asia as far as the Caspian Sea. Even that for which he is\r\nespecially reproached proves the greatness of his power. Demetrius's\r\nfather was well pleased at getting Phila, the daughter of Antipater, as\r\na wife for his son, in spite of the disparity of their ages, because he\r\nregarded her as his son's superior; while it was thought to be a\r\ndisgrace for Antonius to ally himself with Cleopatra, a woman who\r\nexcelled in power and renown all the Kings of her age, except Arsakes\r\nhimself. Antonius had made himself so great that men thought him\r\nentitled to more even than he himself desired.\r\n\r\nII. Demetrius, however, cannot be blamed for attempting to make himself\r\nking over a people accustomed to servitude, while it appeared harsh and\r\ntyrannical for Antonius to try to enslave the people of Rome just after\r\nthey had been set free from the rule of Cæsar: and the greatest of his\r\nexploits, the war against Brutus and Cassius, was waged with the\r\nintention of depriving his countrymen of their liberty. Demetrius,\r\nbefore he became involved in difficulties, used always to act as a\r\nliberator towards Greece, and to drive out the foreign garrisons from\r\nher cities, and did not act like Antonius, who boasted that he had slain\r\nthe would-be liberators of Rome in Macedonia. And though Antonius is\r\nespecially commended for his magnificent generosity, yet Demetrius so\r\nfar surpassed him as to bestow more upon his enemies than Antonius would\r\nupon his friends. It is true that Antonius gained great credit for\r\nhaving caused Brutus to be honourably buried; but Demetrius buried all\r\nhis enemy's slain, gave money and presents to his prisoners, and sent\r\nthem back to Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nIII. Both were arrogant when in prosperity, and set no bounds to their\r\nluxury and pleasures. Yet it cannot be said that Demetrius was ever so\r\nimmersed in enjoyments as to let slip the time for action, but he only\r\ndedicated the superfluity of his leisure to enjoyment, and used his\r\nLamia, like the mythical nightmare, only when he was half asleep or at\r\nplay. When he was preparing for war, no ivy wreathed his spear, no\r\nperfume scented his helmet, nor did he go forth from his bed-chamber to\r\nbattle covered with finery, but, as Euripides says, he laid the Bacchic\r\nwand aside, and served the unhallowed god of war, and, indeed, never\r\nsuffered any reverse through his own carelessness or love of pleasure.\r\nBut just as in pictures we often see Omphale stealing the club and\r\nstripping off the lion's skin from Herakles, so Cleopatra frequently\r\nwould disarm Antonius and turn his mind to pleasure, persuading him to\r\ngive up mighty enterprises and even necessary campaigns to wander and\r\nsport with her on the shores of Canopus and beside the tomb of Osiris.\r\nAt last, like Paris, he fled from battle to nestle on her breast, though\r\nParis only took refuge in his chamber after he had been defeated in\r\nbattle, while Antonius, by his pursuit of Cleopatra, gave up his chance\r\nof victory.\r\n\r\nIV. Moreover, in marrying several wives, Demetrius did not break through\r\nany custom, for he only did what had been usual for the kings of\r\nMacedonia since the days of Philip and Alexander, and what was done by\r\nLysimachus and Ptolemy in his own time; and he showed due respect to all\r\nhis wives; while Antonius, in the first place, married two wives at the\r\nsame time, which no Roman had ever dared to do before, and then drove\r\naway his own countrywoman and his legitimate wife to please a foreigner,\r\nand one to whom he was not legally married. Yet with all his excesses\r\nAntonius was never led by his vices into such sacrilegious impiety as is\r\nrecorded of Demetrius. We are told that no dogs are allowed to enter the\r\nAcropolis,[481] because these animals copulate more openly than any\r\nothers; but Demetrius consorted with harlots in the very temple of the\r\nvirgin goddess, and debauched many of the Athenian citizens, while,\r\nalthough one would have imagined that a man of such a temperament would\r\nbe especially averse to cruelty, Demetrius must be charged with this in\r\nallowing, or rather compelling, the most beautiful and modest of the\r\nAthenians to suffer death in order to avoid outrage. To sum up, the\r\nvices of Antonius were ruinous to himself, while those of Demetrius were\r\nruinous to others.\r\n\r\nV. Yet Demetrius always behaved well to his parents, whereas Antonius\r\nallowed his mother's brother to perish in order that he might compass\r\nthe death of Cicero, which was of itself so odious a crime that we\r\nshould scarcely think Antonius justified if by Cicero's death he had\r\nsaved his uncle's life. With regard to the perjuries and breaking of\r\ntheir words which they both committed, the one in seizing Artabazus, and\r\nthe other in murdering Alexander, Antonius has a satisfactory defence;\r\nfor he himself was first deserted and betrayed by Artabazus in Media:\r\nwhile many writers say that Demetrius himself invented false pretexts\r\nfor his treatment of Alexander, and accused a man whom he had wronged\r\nwith a design on his life, instead of defending himself against one who\r\nwas already his enemy. Again, the exploits of Demetrius were all\r\naccomplished by himself in person; while, on the other hand, Antonius\r\nwon some of his most important battles by his lieutenants, without\r\nhimself being present.\r\n\r\nVI. The ruin of both was due to themselves, though in a different\r\nmanner, for the Macedonians deserted from Demetrius, while Antonious\r\ndeserted his own troops when they were risking their lives in his\r\ndefence; so that we must blame the former for having rendered his army\r\nso hostile to him, and the latter for betraying so much loyalty and\r\ndevotion. In their manner of death neither can be praised, but that of\r\nDemetrius seems the less creditable of the two, for he endured to be\r\ntaken prisoner, and when in confinement willingly spent three years in\r\ndrinking and gluttony, like a wild beast that has been tamed; while\r\nAntonius, though he killed himself like a coward, and in a piteous and\r\ndishonourable fashion, nevertheless died before he fell into the hands\r\nof his enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF DION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. We are told by the poet Simonides, Sossius Senecio, that the Trojans\r\nbore no malice against the Corinthians for joining the rest of the\r\nGreeks in the siege of Troy, because Glaukus, who was himself of\r\nCorinthian extraction, fought heartily on their side. In the same manner\r\nwe may expect that neither Greeks nor Romans will be able to blame the\r\ndoctrines of the academy, as each nation derives equal credit from their\r\npractice in this book of mine, which contains the lives of Brutus and\r\nDion, of whom the latter was Plato's intimate friend, while the former\r\nwas educated by his writings: so that they were both, as it were, sent\r\nforth from the same school to contend for the greatest prizes. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that there should be a great similarity between\r\ntheir respective achievements, or that they should have proved the truth\r\nof that maxim of their teacher, that nothing great or noble can be\r\neffected in politics except when a wise and just man is possessed of\r\nabsolute power combined with good fortune. Just as Hippomachus the\r\ngymnastic trainer used to declare that he could always tell by their\r\ncarriage those who had been his pupils, even though he only saw them\r\nfrom a distance when they were carrying meat home for their dinner, so\r\nwe may imagine that philosophy accompanies those who have been brought\r\nup in its precepts in every action of their lives, adding a happy grace\r\nand fitness to all that they do.\r\n\r\nII. Their lives resemble one another even more in their misfortunes than\r\nin the objects at which they aimed. Both of them perished by an untimely\r\nfate, unable, with all their mighty efforts, to accomplish the object\r\nwhich they had in view. The most remarkable point of all is that they\r\nboth received a supernatural warning of their death by the appearance to\r\nthem of an evil spirit in a dream. Yet it is a common argument with\r\nthose who deny the truth of such matters that no man of sense ever could\r\nsee a ghost or spirit but that it is only children and women and men who\r\nare wandering in their mind through sickness, who through disorder of\r\nthe brain or distemperature of the body are subject to these vain and\r\nominous fancies, which really arise from the evil spirit of superstition\r\nwithin themselves. If, however, Dion and Brutus, both of whom were\r\nserious and philosophic men, not at all liable to be mistaken or easy to\r\nbe deceived about such matters, did really experience a supernatural\r\nvisitation so distinctly that they told other persons about it, I do not\r\nknow whether we may not be obliged to adopt that strangest of all the\r\ntheories of the ancients that evil and malignant spirits feel a spite\r\nagainst good men, and try to oppose their actions, throwing confusion\r\nand terror in their way in order to shake them in their allegiance to\r\nvirtue; because they fear lest if they passed their lives entirely pure\r\nand without spot of sin, they might after death obtain a higher place\r\nthan themselves. This, however, I must reserve for discussion in another\r\nplace; and now, in this my twelfth book of parallel lives, I will first\r\nproceed to deal with the elder man of the two.\r\n\r\nIII. Dionysius the elder, as soon as he had raised himself to the\r\nthrone, married the daughter of Hermokrates of Syracuse. However, as his\r\npower was not yet firmly established, the people of Syracuse rose in\r\nrevolt, and committed such shocking outrages upon the person of\r\nDionysius's wife, that she voluntarily put herself to death. Dionysius,\r\nafter recovering and confirming his power, now married two wives at the\r\nsame time, one of whom was a Lokrian, named Doris, and the other a\r\nnative of Syracuse, named Aristomache, the daughter of Hipparinus, one\r\nof the first men in Syracuse, who had acted as colleague with Dionysius\r\nhimself when he was appointed to the command of the army with unlimited\r\npowers. It is said that he married them both upon the same day, and that\r\nno man knew which he visited first; and of the remainder of his life he\r\nspent an equal share of his time with each, as he always supped in\r\ncompany with both of them, and spent the night with each in turn. The\r\npopulace of Syracuse would fain have hoped that their countrywoman would\r\nbe preferred to the stranger; but it was the stranger who first bore a\r\nson and heir to Dionysius, to counterbalance her foreign parentage;\r\nwhile Aristomache remained childless for a long time, although Dionysius\r\nwas anxious to have a family by her, and even put to death the mother of\r\nhis Lokrian wife on a charge of having bewitched her.\r\n\r\nIV. Dion was the brother of Aristomache, and at first was treated with\r\nrespect for the sake of his sister, but afterwards, when he had given\r\nproofs of his ability, he gained the favour of the despot by his own\r\ngood qualities. Besides many other privileges, Dionysius ordered his\r\ntreasurers to give Dion anything that he might ask for, letting him know\r\non the same day what they had given him. He was naturally of a high\r\nminded and manly disposition, and he was greatly encouraged in the path\r\nof virtue by the providential accident of Plato's visit to Sicily. This\r\nnever could have been calculated upon according to human ideas of\r\nprobability; but it seems as though some divinity, who had long been\r\nmeditating how to put liberty within the reach of the Syracusans and to\r\nfree them from despotism, must have brought Plato from Italy to\r\nSyracuse, and caused Dion to become his disciple. Dion at this time was\r\nvery young, but was by far the most apt of Plato's scholars, and the\r\nreadiest to follow out his master's instructions in virtue. This we\r\nlearn from Plato's own account of him, and from the circumstances of the\r\ncase. Brought up as Dion had been in the humble position of a subject\r\nunder a despotic ruler, his life had been full of sudden alarms and\r\nviolent alternations of fortune; yet, though he was at this time\r\naccustomed to live in a state of parvenu splendour, and to regard\r\npleasure and power as the only objects of desire, he, as soon as he had\r\nbecome acquainted with philosophic reasoning and exhortation to virtue,\r\nbecame passionately interested in it. With the guileless innocence of\r\nyouth he imagined that the discourses which he had heard would produce\r\nan equally deep impression upon the mind of Dionysius, and took\r\nconsiderable pains to bring Dionysius to meet Plato and listen to his\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nV. When the meeting took place, Plato chose for his subject human\r\nvirtue, and discussed more particularly the virtue of manly courage,\r\nproving that despots are the most cowardly of men. From this he went on\r\nto speak of justice, and as he pointed out that the life of the just is\r\nhappy, and that of the unjust miserable, Dionysius, who considered the\r\nlecture as a reproach to himself, was much exasperated, especially when\r\nhe observed how all the audience admired Plato and were enchanted by his\r\nrhetoric. At last in a rage he asked him why he had come to Sicily: and\r\nwhen Plato answered that he had come in order to find a good man,\r\nDionysius caught up his words, and said, \"You seem hitherto not to have\r\nfound one.\"\r\n\r\nDion and his friends imagined that this outburst marked the end of\r\nDionysius's indignation; and as Plato was now anxious to leave Sicily\r\nthey obtained a passage for him on board of a trireme which was about to\r\nconvey home Pollis, the Lacedæmonian envoy. Dionysius however secretly\r\nbesought Pollis to put Plato to death during the voyage, or at any rate\r\nto sell him for a slave, because, he said, Plato, according to his own\r\nshowing, would be none the worse off for being a slave, but would be\r\njust as happy, provided that he was just. In consequence of this we are\r\ntold that Pollis took Plato to Ægina and there sold him, because the\r\npeople of Ægina were at that time at war with the Athenians, and had\r\npassed a decree that any Athenian found in Ægina should be sold for a\r\nslave.[482] Yet Dion was no less honoured and trusted by Dionysius in\r\nconsequence of this, but was entrusted with the management of the most\r\nimportant negotiations, and was himself sent as ambassador to Carthage,\r\nin which capacity he gained great credit. Indeed he was almost the only\r\nperson whom Dionysius allowed freely to speak his mind, as is proved by\r\nthe reproof which he gave Dionysius about Gelon. It appears that\r\nDionysius was sneering at Gelon and his kingdom, and saying that he was\r\nthe laughing-stock of Sicily. All the other courtiers pretended to\r\napprove of this jest, but Dion harshly answered, \"Yet you have been\r\nallowed to become our despot because of the good example set by Gelon;\r\nbut your example will not encourage any state to imitate us.\" In truth\r\nGelon's conduct as an absolute monarch seems to have been just as\r\nadmirable as that of Dionysius was detestable.\r\n\r\nVI. Dionysius had three children by his Lokrian wife, and four by\r\nAristomache. Of his two daughters, Sophrosyne married her half-brother,\r\nand Arete married Thearides, the brother of Dionysius, but on the death\r\nof Thearides Dion took Arete, who was his own niece, for his wife. In\r\nDionysius's last illness, when his life was despaired of, Dion wished to\r\nask him what was to become of the children of Aristomache, but the\r\nphysicians, who wished to pay their court to the heir to the throne,\r\nwould not allow Dion an opportunity of doing so. Timæus even states that\r\nwhen Dionysius asked for a sleeping draught they gave him one which\r\nrendered him completely insensible, so that he passed from sleep into\r\ndeath. However, as soon as the young Dionysius assembled his friends in\r\ncouncil, Dion made such an admirable speech upon the political situation\r\nthat all the others appeared by his side to be mere children in\r\nintellect, and their words seemed to be those of slaves and grovelling\r\nflatterers of the despot when compared with his bold and fearless\r\nutterances. He impressed upon their minds the greatness of the danger by\r\nwhich they were menaced by Carthage, and promised that if Dionysius\r\nwished for peace he himself would at once set sail for Africa and obtain\r\nthe best terms he could; or that, if he preferred to fight, he would\r\nplace at his disposal a force of fifty triremes, which he would maintain\r\nat his own expense.\r\n\r\nVII. Dionysius greatly admired his magnanimity and approved of his zeal;\r\nbut the others, who thought that they were eclipsed by Dion, and were\r\njealous of his power, at once set to work to effect his ruin, and lost\r\nno opportunity of exasperating the young despot against him by pointing\r\nout that he was plotting to obtain the supreme throne by means of the\r\nfleet, and that his object in making the offer of the ships was to place\r\nall real power in the hands of the children of Aristomache. Their hate\r\nand jealousy of Dion was chiefly owing to the proud reserve of his life,\r\nso different to their own: for they at once began to court the\r\nfriendship of their young and ill-trained monarch by offering him all\r\nkinds of flatteries and pleasures, endeavouring to amuse his leisure by\r\nvagrant amours, drinking parties, and the like dissolute pastimes, which\r\nblunted the excessive sharpness of his tyranny, and made his subjects\r\nregard it as milder and less ferocious than before, although the\r\nalteration was due only to the laziness and not to the real goodness of\r\ntheir ruler. By slow degrees the extravagance and licentious life of the\r\nyoung monarch relaxed and broke those \"chains of adamant\" by which the\r\nelder Dionysius boasted that he had secured his power. We are told that\r\nhe once continued drinking for ninety days in succession, and that\r\nduring the whole of this time his court was a place which no respectable\r\nperson could enter, and where no business could be transacted, as it was\r\na constant scene of singing, jesting, dancing, drunkenness and\r\ndebauchery.\r\n\r\nVIII. As may easily be imagined, Dion soon lost the favour of the\r\nmonarch, as he never relaxed the austerity of his life. For this reason\r\nthe calumnies of infamous men were more easily believed by Dionysius,\r\nwhen they attacked the virtues of Dion, calling his pride arrogance, and\r\nhis boldness of speech churlishness. When he gave good advice he was\r\nthought to reproach them, and because he refused to join in their\r\nexcesses, he seemed to despise them. Indeed, his disposition was\r\nnaturally inclined to haughtiness, and his manners harsh and forbidding.\r\nIt was not only to a young man whose ears were accustomed to flatteries\r\nthat he appeared so ungracious and harsh-tempered, but even those who\r\nwere sincerely attached to him, and who admired the noble simplicity of\r\nhis character, used to blame his discourtesy and rudeness towards those\r\nwith whom he was brought in contact upon political business. Indeed, not\r\nlong after this, Plato, as if prophetically, wrote to him, warning him\r\nagainst a stubborn and arrogant temper, the consort of a lonely life.\r\nYet, even at that time, though Dion was regarded as the most able man in\r\nthe state, and was thought to be the only person who could save the\r\nkingdom from the dangers by which it was menaced, he knew well that his\r\nhonourable and powerful position was not due to any love which the\r\nmonarch bore him, but merely to the fact that he could not do without\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIX. As Dion imagined that this must be caused by Dionysius's want of\r\neducation, he endeavoured to interest him in literature, and to form his\r\ncharacter by the study of philosophy and science. Indeed Dionysius was\r\nfar from being a stupid ruler, but his father, fearing that if he were\r\neducated, and frequented the society of intellectual men, he would\r\ncertainly plot against him and seize his throne, used to keep him shut\r\nup at home, where, through want of companionship and ignorance, he was\r\nforced, we are told, to amuse himself by making little waggons and\r\nlamps, and wooden chairs and tables; for the elder Dionysius was so\r\ndistrustful and suspicious of all men, and was driven by his fears to\r\ntake such precautions against assassination, that he would not even\r\nallow his hair to be cut with a barber's tools, but a workman used to\r\ncome and singe his hair with a live coal. Neither his brother nor his\r\nson was allowed to enter his house in their ordinary dress, but were\r\nobliged to take off their clothes and put on others, so that they might\r\nbe seen naked by the guard. Once when his brother Leptines, describing\r\nthe situation of some place, took a spear from one of the life-guards\r\nand with it drew a map upon the floor, Dionysius was furiously angry\r\nwith him, and put to death the man who gave him the spear. He used to\r\nsay that he suspected all his friends, because he knew that they were\r\nsensible men, who would prefer to be despots themselves rather than live\r\nunder the rule of a despot. He put to death one Marsyas, whom he had\r\nhimself promoted to a responsible post, because he dreamed that he was\r\nkilling him; for Dionysius argued that his dream must have been\r\nsuggested by some thoughts or talk in his waking hours. To such a\r\ncondition of terror and misery was he reduced by his cowardice, although\r\nhe was angry with Plato for not declaring him to be the bravest of men.\r\n\r\nX. Dion, perceiving, as has been said before, that the character of the\r\nyoung Dionysius had been ruined by his want of education, begged him to\r\neducate himself, to offer all possible inducements to the first of\r\nphilosophers to visit Sicily, and when he came, to place himself in his\r\nhands, in order that his character might be exalted by the contemplation\r\nof virtue, and formed upon the noblest of models, which alone can\r\nproduce order out of chaos; by which means he would not only gain great\r\nhappiness for himself, but would bestow great happiness upon the\r\ncitizens by his mild and just paternal rule, thus becoming a true king\r\ninstead of a despot. He pointed out that the \"adamantine chains\" by\r\nwhich Dionysius's father boasted that his dominion was secured, were not\r\nterror and force, the numbers of his ships of war, or the thousands of\r\nhis barbarian mercenaries, but rather the goodwill, loyalty, and\r\ngratitude engendered by virtue and justice, which, though softer than\r\nthose rough defences, would nevertheless establish his rule far more\r\nsecurely than they. Besides these considerations he urged that it was a\r\nsorry thing, and showed a want of proper ambition for a ruler to be\r\nsplendidly dressed and luxuriously lodged, but yet to be no more\r\nintellectual in his conversation and arguments than any ordinary man,\r\nand to neglect to adorn the palace of his soul as became a king.\r\n\r\nXI. As Dion frequently urged these considerations, and quoted several of\r\nPlato's discourses, Dionysius became passionately desirous of seeing and\r\nconversing with Plato. Many letters were at once sent to Athens by\r\nDionysius, while Plato also received many injunctions from Dion and from\r\nseveral of the Pythagorean philosophers in Italy, bidding him go to\r\nSyracuse, undertake the guidance of the mind of this young and powerful\r\nruler, and fill it with serious thoughts. Plato obeyed their invitation,\r\nchiefly, he tells us, because he feared to appear a mere man of words,\r\nunwilling to take in hand any real work, and also because he hoped that\r\nif he could purify the mind of the chief, he might through him influence\r\nfor good the whole of the corrupt people of Sicily. The opponents of\r\nDion, who feared the results of any change in the character of\r\nDionysius, prevailed upon him to recall from exile Philistus, a man of\r\nintellectual culture and an experienced courtier, in order to make use\r\nof him as a counterpoise to Plato and his philosophy. Indeed, Philistus\r\nhad zealously assisted in the establishment of the despotism, and for a\r\nlong time had acted as chief of the garrison of the citadel. There was\r\nalso a report that he had been the favoured lover of the mother of the\r\nelder Dionysius, and that, too, not altogether without the knowledge of\r\nthe despot; for when Leptines, without telling Dionysius of it, gave\r\nPhilistus for his wife one of the two daughters which had been born to\r\nhim by a woman whom he had seduced while she was married to another man,\r\nand who afterwards lived with him, Dionysius was very angry, caused the\r\nwife of Leptines to be imprisoned in chains, and forced Philistus to\r\nleave Sicily and take refuge with some friends of his at Adria, where he\r\nis thought to have found leisure to write the greater part of his\r\nhistory; for he never returned to Syracuse during the life of the elder\r\nDionysius, but it was after that prince's death, as has been told, that\r\nthe opposition to Dion brought him back as being a person more likely to\r\nagree with their views and more likely to support the monarchy.\r\n\r\nXII. Philistus on his return at once became closely connected with the\r\nmonarchy; while Dion was assailed by misrepresentations and slanders\r\nreported by others to the despot, charging him with having discussed the\r\nextinction of despotism with Theodotes and Herakleides. Dion appears to\r\nhave hoped by the influence of Plato to remove from Dionysius all the\r\narbitrary harshness of a despot, and to make him into an orderly\r\nconstitutional ruler. If he resisted, and refused to be thus softened\r\nand refined, Dion had determined to set him aside, and to restore to the\r\nSyracusans their free constitution; not that he was an admirer of\r\ndemocracy, but because he thought that at any rate it was better than a\r\ndespotism for states which were not ruled by a wise and stable\r\noligarchy.\r\n\r\nXIII. While affairs were in this posture, Plato arrived at Sicily and\r\nreceived a most kindly and magnificent welcome. One of the royal\r\ncarriages, splendidly equipped, stood ready to receive him as he landed,\r\nand Dionysius offered sacrifice, as though some great good fortune had\r\nbefallen his rule. The sobriety of the royal banquets, the refined tone\r\nof the court and the gentle manners of Dionysius himself in transacting\r\nbusiness, all inspired the Syracusans with great hope of a change for\r\nthe better. It became the fashion to take interest in philosophical\r\nmatters, and it is said that so many began to study geometry that the\r\npalace was filled with the dust in which they drew their figures. In a\r\nfew days' time a hereditary sacrifice was celebrated in the palace; and\r\nwhen the herald, according to custom, prayed that the despotism might\r\nremain unshaken for many years, it is said that Dionysius, who stood\r\nnear him, exclaimed: \"Will you not cease from imprecating curses upon\r\nus?\" This greatly grieved the party of Philistus, who feared that\r\nPlato's power over Dionysius would become unassailable, if he were\r\nallowed time to become intimate with him, if after so short an\r\nacquaintance he had already wrought so great a change in the young man's\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nXIV. They now no longer singly and in secret, but in a body openly\r\nassailed Dion, declaring that they could easily see through his motives\r\nin bewitching Dionysius with the eloquence of Plato, in order that\r\nDionysius might be induced to voluntarily abdicate his throne, and hand\r\nit over to the children of Aristomache, whose uncle Dion was. Some of\r\nthem even pretended to be angry that, though in former times a great\r\nAthenian naval and military force sailed thither and perished before it\r\ncould effect the conquest of Syracuse, yet now the Athenians should be\r\nable, by means of one single sophist, to destroy the throne of\r\nDionysius, and persuade him to desert his ten thousand life-guards,\r\nleave his four hundred ships of war, his ten thousand cavalry and many\r\nthousands more of infantry soldiers, in order to seek in the Academy for\r\nthe ineffable good, and find real pleasure in geometry, leaving the\r\npleasures of power, wealth and luxury to be enjoyed by Dion and Dion's\r\nnephews. This led at first to Dion's being regarded with suspicion, and\r\nthen, when Dionysius began to show his dislike openly, he received a\r\nletter which Dion had secretly despatched to the Carthaginian\r\ncommanders, warning them, when they came to treat for peace with\r\nDionysius, not to conduct the interview without his being present, as\r\nhe would see that the whole matter was permanently settled. We are told\r\nby Timæus that Dionysius, after reading this letter to Philistus and\r\nhaving taken counsel with him, deceived Dion by making false offers of\r\nreconciliation with him. After much friendly talk, he declared that\r\ntheir differences were at an end, and then, leading him alone towards\r\nthe sea-shore under the walls of the citadel, showed him the letter, and\r\nupbraided him with plotting with the Carthaginians against himself. He\r\nwould not listen to Dion when he tried to excuse himself, but at once\r\nplaced him on board of a small vessel and ordered the sailors to land\r\nhim on the coast of Italy.\r\n\r\nXV. Upon this, as Dionysius appeared to have acted very harshly, the\r\nwhole palace was plunged in grief by the women, while the city of\r\nSyracuse became much excited, expecting that the exile of Dion and the\r\nmistrust with which others regarded the despot would soon lead to some\r\nrevolution. Dionysius, perceiving and fearing this, encouraged the women\r\nand friends of Dion, speaking of Dion as though he were not banished,\r\nbut had left the country of his own free will, for fear that if he\r\nremained at home his quick temper might betray him into some violent\r\ncollision with himself. He placed two ships at the disposal of Dion's\r\nrelatives, and bade them embark with as much of his property and\r\nservants as they pleased and go to rejoin him in Peloponnesus. Dion's\r\nproperty was very extensive, and his whole household was on a\r\nmagnificent, almost a royal, scale. Everything was now carried away by\r\nhis friends, and much more was sent to him by his female relatives and\r\nhis friends, so that his wealth and magnificence became famous\r\nthroughout Greece, and the power of the despot became enhanced by the\r\nsight of the riches of the exile.\r\n\r\nXVI. Dionysius at once removed Plato into the citadel, where, under\r\npretence of showing him kindly respect, he was kept in an honourable\r\ncaptivity, in order that he might not sail away with Dion, a witness of\r\nhis unjust treatment. By degrees, like a wild animal who gradually\r\nbecomes used to the touch of human beings, so Dionysius accustomed\r\nhimself to the society and discourses of Plato, and, after the manner\r\nof despots, conceived a violent passion for him. He was especially\r\nanxious that Plato should return his affection and should approve of his\r\nacts, and was even willing to entrust the government and the crown\r\nitself to him if he would only not prefer Dion's friendship to his own.\r\nThis passion of his caused great annoyance to Plato, for like all true\r\nlovers he was furiously jealous and had frequent quarrels and\r\nreconciliations with him, being very eager to hear his discourses, and\r\nengage in the study of philosophy, and yet being influenced by those who\r\nadvised him to keep away from Plato, as he would be corrupted by his\r\nteaching. Meanwhile, as some war broke out, he sent Plato away,\r\npromising that in a year's time he would recall Dion. This promise he\r\nbroke at once, but he remitted to Dion the revenues of his estate, and\r\nbesought Plato to pardon his breach of faith about the time, because of\r\nthe war; for, as soon as peace should be made, he promised that he would\r\nat once send for Dion. He also asked Plato to beg Dion to remain quiet,\r\nand not to engage in any revolutionary schemes, and not to traduce his\r\ncharacter to the Greeks.\r\n\r\nXVII. Plato endeavoured to effect this, and turned Dion's attention to\r\nphilosophy, and kept him in the Academy. Dion lived at this time in the\r\ncity of Athens, in the house of Kallippus, one of his friends, though he\r\nalso bought an estate in the country for recreation, which, when he\r\nsubsequently set sail for Sicily, he presented to Speusippus, who, of\r\nall the Athenians, was his most intimate friend. This intimacy was\r\nbrought about by Plato, who hoped that the harshness of Dion's character\r\nmight be somewhat softened by the society of a well-bred and cheerful\r\nman. Such a person as this was Speusippus, whom we find spoken of in\r\nTimon's Silli as being \"good at a jest.\" When Plato himself exhibited a\r\nchorus of boys, Dion both trained the chorus and defrayed all the\r\nexpenses, and Plato permitted him to gain this distinction although it\r\nwas likely to obtain popularity for Dion at his own expense. Dion also\r\nvisited other cities, where he associated with the best and most\r\nstatesmanlike of the citizens, and attended their solemn festivals,\r\nwithout ever betraying anything repulsive, affected, or imperious in his\r\nmanner, but acting with manliness and discretion, and discoursing with\r\nelegance on philosophy as well as ordinary topics. By this conduct he\r\neverywhere gained good opinions, and public honours were decreed to him\r\nby various cities. The Lacedæmonians even adopted him as a Spartan,\r\ndisregarding the anger of Dionysius, though he at the time was zealously\r\nassisting them in a war against the Thebans. We are told that once Dion\r\nwished to see Ptoiodorus, of Megara, and went to his house. Ptoiodorus,\r\nit seems, was a rich and powerful man; and when Dion observed the crowds\r\nat his door and the busy throng and saw how hard it was to gain an\r\naudience of him, he turned to his friends, who were vexed at this, and\r\nsaid: \"Why should we find fault with this man? for we ourselves used to\r\ndo just the same thing at Syracuse?\"\r\n\r\nXVIII. As time went on, Dionysius, feeling jealous of Dion, and fearing\r\nthe popularity which he was obtaining among the Greeks, left off\r\nforwarding his revenues to him and confiscated his property. Being\r\ndesirous of effacing the bad impression which he had made upon all\r\nphilosophers by his treatment of Plato, he collected round him many men\r\nwho had a reputation for learning. As he wished to surpass them all in\r\nargument, he was forced to make use, often improperly, of what he had\r\nvery imperfectly learned from Plato. He now again began to wish for\r\nPlato, and blamed himself for not having made use of him when he was\r\npresent, and for not having listened to all his noble language. Frantic\r\nin his desires, and impatient to obtain whatever he wished, as despots\r\nare, he at once set his heart upon Plato and tried every means to\r\nattract him. He induced Archytas and the other successors of the\r\noriginal Pythagorean philosophers to invite Plato; for it was by means\r\nof Plato that Dionysius had at first become their friend. They sent\r\nArchedemus to Plato, and Dionysius also despatched a trireme and several\r\nof his friends to entreat Plato to come: while he himself wrote a letter\r\nin which he distinctly stated that Dion would never get his rights if\r\nPlato refused to come to Sicily, but that if he would, Dion should\r\nreceive them all. Many letters also reached Dion from his sister and his\r\nwife, urging him to beg Plato to accede to the request of Dionysius,\r\nand not afford him grounds for ill-treating them. Thus, they say, it was\r\nthat Plato came to sail a third time into the straits of Scylla.\r\n\r\n   \"Again the dread Charybdis to explore.\"\r\n\r\nXIX. His arrival afforded unbounded delight to Dionysius, and again\r\nfilled Sicily with great hopes; for all men prayed and were eager that\r\nPlato and philosophy should get the better of Philistus and despotism.\r\nHe was treated with great respect by the ladies,[483] and received from\r\nDionysius a mark of confidence which was accorded to no one else, in\r\nbeing allowed to come into his presence without his clothes being\r\nsearched. As Dionysius frequently offered valuable presents to Plato,\r\nwho never would receive them, Aristippus of Cyrene, who was present,\r\nobserved that Dionysius exercised a very cheap generosity; for he gave\r\nsmall presents to himself and to others who wished for more, and offered\r\ngreat ones to Plato, who would not accept of any. When, however, after\r\nthe first welcome was over, Plato began to speak of Dion, Dionysius at\r\nfirst put off discussing the subject, and subsequently reproaches and\r\nquarrels took place between them, of which no one else was aware, since\r\nDionysius kept them secret, and by showing Plato assiduous attentions\r\nand marks of respect tried to win him over from his friendship for Dion.\r\nPlato, too, at first would not publish what he knew of the treachery and\r\nfalsehood of Dionysius, but affected not to perceive it and endured it\r\nin silence. While they were on these terms, though they believed that no\r\none knew it, Helikon of Kyzikus, an intimate friend of Plato, foretold\r\nan eclipse of the sun; and as it happened according to his prediction,\r\nthe despot was much impressed, and gave him a talent of silver.\r\nAristippus now in joke said to the other philosophers that he too had a\r\nremarkable event to predict; and when they begged him to tell them what\r\nit was, he said, \"I predict that before long Plato and Dionysius will\r\nbecome foes.\" At last Dionysius sold Dion's property and kept the money,\r\nand even removed Plato from the lodgings in the gardens near his own\r\npalace, where he had hitherto dwelt, and quartered him among the\r\nmercenary troops, who had long disliked Plato and wished to make away\r\nwith him, because they believed him to be counselling Dionysius to\r\nabdicate and to live without a bodyguard.\r\n\r\nXX. Archytas and his friends, when they heard of the danger to which\r\nPlato was exposed, at once sent a thirty-oared vessel with an embassy to\r\nDionysius, demanding Plato from him, and alleging that he had originally\r\ncome to Syracuse at their request, and that they were responsible for\r\nhis safety. Dionysius concealed his dislike of Plato by feasting him and\r\ntreating him kindly on his departure, but could not help saying to him,\r\n\"I suppose, Plato, you will abuse me terribly to your\r\nfellow-philosophers,\" or something to that effect. At this Plato smiled,\r\nand replied, \"I trust that we shall never be so ill off in the Academy\r\nfor subjects to discuss, as for any one to make mention of you.\" Such,\r\nthey say, were the terms upon which they parted; though this does not\r\nentirely agree with Plato's own account of the matter.\r\n\r\nXXI. Dion was much angered by these proceedings of Dionysius, and\r\nshortly afterwards was converted into an open enemy on hearing of the\r\ntreatment of his wife, on which subject Plato wrote in enigmas to\r\nDionysius. This happened as follows:--After the expulsion of Dion,\r\nDionysius, when he sent Plato away, bade him secretly make inquiries as\r\nto whether there was anything to prevent Dion's wife being bestowed upon\r\nanother man; for there was a rumour, which may have been true or merely\r\ninvented by Dion's enemies, that the marriage had been forced upon Dion\r\nagainst his will, and that he and his wife had not lived happily\r\ntogether. Plato, as soon as he arrived at Athens conversed freely with\r\nDion, and then wrote a letter to the despot, some of which was clearly\r\nexpressed, but which in one part intimated to him, in a manner which he\r\nalone could understand, that the writer had spoken about the matter to\r\nDion, and that he would certainly be furious if Dionysius attempted\r\nanything of the kind. At that time, as there were still great hopes of\r\narranging their quarrel, Dionysius did nothing further, but allowed his\r\nsister to remain living with her child by Dion. When, however, they\r\nbecame irreconcilable enemies and Plato, after his second visit, was\r\nsent away bitterly disliked by Dionysius, he proceeded to give Arete in\r\nmarriage, sorely against her will, to one of his friends, named\r\nTimokrates, not imitating in this respect the gentle conduct of his\r\nfather; for the elder Dionysius also had for an enemy Polyxenus the\r\nhusband of his sister Theste. Polyxenus, fearing for his life, escaped\r\nfrom Syracuse and left Sicily. Upon this Dionysius sent for his sister\r\nand blamed her for having known of her husband's intention to take\r\nflight, and not having told him of it; but she, undismayed, answered him\r\nfearlessly, \"Dionysius, do you think me so bad and cowardly a wife that,\r\nif I had known of the intention of my husband to flee, I should not have\r\naccompanied him? Indeed, I did not know of it; for it would have been\r\nmore creditable to me to have been spoken of as the wife of Polyxenus\r\nthe exile than as the sister of Dionysius the despot.\" It is said that\r\nwhen Theste used this bold language the despot regarded her with\r\nadmiration, and she was also so much admired by the people of Syracuse\r\nfor her courage and goodness that after the fall of the dynasty they\r\nstill continued to treat her with the honours due to royalty, and, when\r\nshe died, all the citizens came in procession to her funeral. These\r\ncircumstances have required a digression which is not without value.\r\n\r\nXXII. Dion after this at once prepared for war. Plato would take no part\r\nin his attempts, both out of respect for Dionysius and because of his\r\nown advanced age; but Speusippus and his other companions joined Dion,\r\nand encouraged him to set free Sicily, which they said was stretching\r\nout its hands to him for help and would eagerly welcome him. It seems,\r\nindeed, that when Plato was at Syracuse, Speusippus and his friends, who\r\nmixed more with the people, discovered their real feelings. At first\r\nthey were afraid to speak plainly, fearing that the despot was\r\nexperimenting upon them, but at length they took courage. All told the\r\nsame story, begging and encouraging Dion to come, not with ships of war\r\nand horse and foot soldiers, but to embark in an open boat, and lend\r\nmerely his person and his name to the Sicilians in their struggle\r\nagainst Dionysius. Encouraged by these reports, which he received from\r\nSpeusippus and his friends, Dion secretly levied a force of mercenaries,\r\nbut not in his own name, and without disclosing his intention. Many\r\nstatesmen and philosophers assisted him, among the later Eudemus of\r\nCyprus, in whose honour, after his death, Aristotle composed his\r\ndialogue upon the soul, and Timonides of Leukas. They brought over to\r\nhim also Miltas of Thessaly, a soothsayer and former student of the\r\nAcademy. Yet, of all those men who had been banished by the despot, who\r\nwere not less than a thousand in number, five-and-twenty alone took part\r\nin the expedition, and all the rest shrank from doing so. Their\r\nstarting-point was the island of Zakynthus, where was assembled a force\r\nnumbering less than eight hundred soldiers, all of whom, however, were\r\nmen of distinction who had served in many great campaigns, and were in\r\nadmirable bodily condition, and such bold and skilful warriors as would\r\nbe able to excite and inspire with courage the multitude which Dion\r\nhoped would rally round him in Sicily.\r\n\r\nXXIII. These men, when they heard that the expedition was directed\r\nagainst Sicily and Dionysius, were at first scared and refused to go,\r\ndeclaring that only the frenzy excited by some personal quarrel, or the\r\nfailure of all reasonable hopes of success, could have led Dion to\r\nembark upon such a desperate enterprise, and they were incensed with\r\ntheir own officers and those who had enlisted them for not having at the\r\noutset informed them of the object of the war. When, however, Dion\r\naddressed them, pointing out the rottenness of the monarchy, and\r\ninforming them that he was taking them, not so much as soldiers as in\r\norder to use them as leaders for the Syracusans and other peoples of\r\nSicily, who had long been ripe for revolt, and when, after Dion's\r\nspeech, Alkimenes, one of the expedition, who was one of the most\r\ncelebrated of the Achæans both by birth and merit, spoke to the same\r\neffect, they consented to go. The time was midsummer and the\r\nEtesian[484] winds were blowing over the sea. The moon was at the full.\r\nDion prepared a magnificent sacrifice to Apollo and marched in solemn\r\nprocession to the temple with his soldiers, all arrayed in complete\r\narmour. After the sacrifice he feasted them in the stadium or\r\nrace-course of the people of Zakynthus, where they had an opportunity of\r\nadmiring the splendour of his gold and silver plate, and reflected that\r\na man past middle life, as he was, and possessed of such wealth, would\r\nnever attempt an extravagant enterprise without reasonable expectation\r\nof success, or unless his friends upon the spot had promised to furnish\r\nhim with abundant resources.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Just after the libations[485] and customary prayers, the moon\r\nbecame eclipsed. Dion and his friends saw nothing remarkable in this, as\r\nthey could calculate the periods of eclipses, and knew how the shadow\r\nwas produced upon the moon by the interposition of the earth between it\r\nand the sun. As, however, the soldiers were alarmed at the portent and\r\nrequired some encouragement, Miltas the soothsayer came into the midst\r\nof them and addressed them, bidding them be of good cheer and expect the\r\nmost complete success; for the gods, he declared, foretold by this sign\r\nthat something brilliant would be extinguished. Now there was nothing\r\nmore brilliant than the monarchy of Dionysius, whose light was fated to\r\nbe quenched by them as soon as they arrived at Sicily. This\r\ninterpretation Miltas told to them all; but when a swarm of bees was\r\nseen to settle on the sterns of the ships, he privately told Dion and\r\nhis friends that he feared lest this might portend that at first they\r\nwould be very properous, but that after blooming for a short time their\r\nprosperity would wither away. It is said, too, that many ominous signs\r\nwere vouchsafed by Heaven to Dionysius. An eagle snatched up a spear\r\nfrom one of the life-guards, soared aloft with it, and let it fall into\r\nthe sea; and one day the sea-water which washes the walls of the citadel\r\nbecame quite sweet and drinkable, so that all men noticed it. Swine also\r\nwere born without ears, though perfect in all other parts. This was\r\ninterpreted by the soothsayers to be a sign of insurrection and\r\ndisobedience, and to mean that the people would no longer hearken to the\r\ncommands of the despot, while the portent of the sea-water meant that\r\nafter bitter miseries sweet and pleasant times were in store for the\r\npeople of Syracuse. The eagle, they said, is the servant of Zeus, and\r\nthe spear is the symbol of power and sovereignty; wherefore the greatest\r\nof the gods must intend to sink and destroy the monarchy. These\r\nincidents we are told by Theopompus.\r\n\r\nXXV. The soldiers of Dion were contained in two merchant-ships, which\r\nwere accompanied by another small vessel and two galleys of thirty\r\noars.[486] Besides the arms carried by the soldiers, Dion took with him\r\ntwo thousand shields, many spears and missiles, and sufficient\r\nprovisions to supply them during the whole voyage, which was to be\r\nperformed entirely under canvass and over the open sea, because they\r\nfeared to approach the land, and had learned that Philistus was cruising\r\noff the Iapygian Cape with a squadron to intercept them. Sailing with a\r\nlight and gentle wind for twelve days, on the thirteenth they reached\r\nPachynus, the southern extremity of Sicily. Here Protus their pilot bade\r\nthem make haste to disembark, warning them that if they left the land\r\nand steered away from the cape, they would be obliged to spend many days\r\nand nights at sea during the summer season, when a southerly gale might\r\nbe expected. Dion, however, feared to disembark so near his foes, and,\r\nwishing to land further away, sailed along the coast past Cape Pachynus.\r\nHereupon a violent northerly wind, accompanied by a high sea, drove the\r\nships away from Sicily, while at the rising of Arcturus a storm of\r\nthunder and lightning burst upon them with furious rain. At this the\r\nsailors became dismayed, and lost their reckoning, but suddenly found\r\nthat the ships were being carried by the waves towards the rockiest and\r\nmost precipitous cliffs of the island Kerkina,[487] off the coast of\r\nLibya. They narrowly escaped being dashed to pieces upon the rocks, but\r\nstruggled along, keeping themselves off the land with\r\npunting-poles,[488] until at length the storm abated and they learned\r\nfrom a vessel which they fell in with that they were near what are\r\ncalled the \"Heads\" of the Great Syrtis. It now fell calm and they became\r\ndisheartened and quarrelled with one another; but soon an off-shore wind\r\nsprang up from the south, though they, not expecting a southerly wind,\r\ncould scarcely believe in the change. The wind gradually increased in\r\nforce, and they, setting all the sail they were able, and commending\r\nthemselves in prayer to the gods, crossed the open sea from Libya to\r\nSicily before the wind. They made a quick passage, and on the fifth day\r\ncame to an anchor at Minoa, a small city in that part of Sicily which\r\nbelonged to the Carthaginians. The Carthaginian commander, Synalus, who\r\nwas a friend of Dion, happened to be present in the town. Not knowing\r\nwhat the expedition was, or that Dion, was with it, he attempted to\r\nprevent the soldiers from landing; but they poured out of their ships\r\nfully armed, and though in accordance with Dion's order they killed no\r\none, because of his friendship with the Carthaginian leader, yet they\r\nrouted the Minoans, entered their city with the fugitives, and captured\r\nit. When the two chiefs met, they embraced one another, and Dion\r\nrestored the city to Synalus without doing it any hurt, while Synalus\r\nshowed hospitality to the soldiers and provided Dion with the supplies\r\nwhich he needed.\r\n\r\nXXVI. What specially encouraged them was the absence of Dionysius from\r\nSyracuse, although they had no hand in bringing it about; for he had\r\njust started on a voyage to the coast of Italy with a fleet of eighty\r\nships. Although Dion begged his soldiers to wait and recruit their\r\nstrength after the hardships of their long sea voyage, they would not\r\nremain there, but in their eagerness to seize this favourable\r\nopportunity bade Dion lead them to Syracuse. Dion now left behind his\r\nsurplus arms and baggage at Minoa, and, begging Synalus to send them on\r\nto him when he should have need of them, set out on his march to\r\nSyracuse. On the road, he was first joined by two hundred horsemen,\r\ncitizens of Agrigentum, dwelling near Eknomon. After these, some of the\r\npeople of Gela also joined his army.\r\n\r\nThe news of Dion's march soon reached Syracuse, and Timokrates, the\r\nhusband of Dion's late wife, the sister of Dionysius, who was left in\r\ncharge of the garrison, sent a messenger in great haste to Dionysius\r\nwith a letter telling of Dion's arrival. He himself endeavoured to\r\nmaintain order and put down all insurrections in the city, for all the\r\npeople were excited at the news, but remained quiet as yet, through fear\r\nand doubt. Meantime a strange mischance befel the bearer of the letter\r\nto Dionysius. He crossed the straits to Italy, passed through the city\r\nof Rhegium, and as he hurried on towards Kaulonia, where Dionysius was,\r\nhe fell in with one of his friends, carrying a newly slaughtered victim.\r\nHe was given a piece of meat by the man, and went on in haste. He walked\r\nsome part of the night, but being forced by fatigue to take a little\r\nsleep, he lay down, just as he was, in a wood by the road-side. While he\r\nslept, a wolf, attracted by the smell, snatched up the meat, which he\r\nhad tied to his wallet, and ran off with it, carrying away with it the\r\nwallet in which the man had placed the letter. When the man woke and\r\ndiscovered his loss, after much vain searching, as he could not find it,\r\nhe decided not to go to the despot without the letter, but to make off\r\nand keep out of the way.\r\n\r\nXXVII. In consequence of this Dionysius only heard of the war in Sicily\r\nmuch later and from other persons, and meanwhile Dion had been joined on\r\nhis march by the people of Kamarina, and by a considerable number of the\r\nSyracusans who lived in the country. The Leontines and Campanians, who\r\nformed the garrison of Epipolæ, in consequence of Dion's sending them a\r\nfalse report that he intended to attack their city first, left\r\nTimokrates, and went away thither to defend their own property. When\r\nnews of this reached Dion, who was encamped near Akræ, he aroused his\r\nsoldiers while it was yet night and marched to the river Anapus, which\r\nis ten stadia distant from the city. There he halted and offered\r\nsacrifice beside the river, praying to the rising sun, and at the same\r\ntime the soothsayers declared that the gods would give him the victory.\r\nObserving that Dion wore a garland because he was sacrificing, all those\r\nwho were present at the sacrifice with one impulse crowned themselves\r\nwith flowers. No less than five thousand men had joined him on his\r\nmarch. They were badly armed in a make-shift fashion, but their zeal\r\nsupplied the deficiencies of their equipment, and when Dion led the way\r\nthey all started at a run, shouting for joy, and encouraging one another\r\nto recover their freedom.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Of the Syracusans within the walls, the chief men and upper\r\nclasses in their most splendid raiment met Dion at the gates, while the\r\npopulace attacked the friends of the despot, and seized upon the spies,\r\na wicked and hateful class of men, who used to live among the people of\r\nthe city and report their opinions and conversations to the despot.\r\nThese men were the first to suffer for their crimes, as they were beaten\r\nto death by any of the citizens who fell in with them. Timokrates,\r\nunable to reach the garrison of the citadel, mounted his horse and rode\r\naway from the city, spreading alarm and confusion everywhere as he fled\r\nby exaggerating the numbers of Dion's army, that he might not be thought\r\nto have surrendered the city through fear to a small force.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Dion could already be seen plainly, as he marched first of all\r\nhis men, clad in splendid armour. On one side of him was his brother\r\nMegakles, and on the other the Athenian Kallippus, both crowned with\r\ngarlands. Next marched a hundred of the mercenary soldiers, as a\r\nbodyguard for Dion, while the rest of the men were led on by their\r\nofficers in battle array. The entire procession was looked upon and\r\nwelcomed as though it were sacred by the citizens of Syracuse, who,\r\nafter forty-two years of tyranny, saw liberty and a popular constitution\r\nrestored to their city.\r\n\r\nXXIX. When Dion had entered by the Temenitid[489] gate, he caused his\r\ntrumpet to sound to obtain silence; and then a herald made proclamation\r\nthat Dion and Megakles were come to put down the monarchy, and that they\r\nset free from the despot both the Syracusans and the other Sicilian\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nAs Dion wished to address the people in person, he proceeded through\r\nAchradina, while the Syracusans placed animals for sacrifice, tables and\r\nbowls of wine on each side of the street,[490] and each, as Dion passed\r\nthem, strewed flowers in his path and addressed prayers to him as if to\r\na god. In front of the citadel, with its Pentapyla, or Five Gates, stood\r\na sundial, a conspicuous and lofty work, erected by Dionysius. Dion\r\nmounted upon this, and addressed the citizens, encouraging them to hold\r\nfast the freedom which they had obtained. The people, in joy and\r\ngratitude to them, elected them both generals, with unlimited powers,\r\nand at their earnest request chose twenty more as their colleagues, half\r\nof whom were taken from the exiles who had returned with Dion. The\r\nprophets considered it to be an excellent omen that Dion, while\r\naddressing the people, should have trodden under his feet the building\r\nwhich the despot had reared in his pride; but they augured ill from his\r\nhaving been chosen general while standing upon a sundial, lest his\r\nfortunes should soon experience some revolution. After this he captured\r\nEpipolæ, released the citizens who were imprisoned there and cut off\r\nthe citadel by a palisade.[491] On the seventh day after this,\r\nDionysius returned to the citadel by sea, and waggons arrived bringing\r\nto Dion the arms and armour which he had left with Synalus. These he\r\ndistributed among the citizens, and of the others, each man equipped\r\nhimself as well as he was able, and eagerly offered his services as a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nXXX. Dionysius at first sent ambassadors privately to Dion to endeavour\r\nto corrupt him. Afterwards, as Dion bade him speak openly to the people\r\nof Syracuse, who were now free, Dionysius through his ambassadors made\r\nthem attractive offers of moderate taxation and moderate military\r\nservice, subject to their own vote of consent.[492] These proposals were\r\nscornfully rejected by the Syracusans. Dion told the ambassadors that he\r\nand his party could have no dealings with Dionysius unless he abdicated;\r\nbut that if he did so, he himself, remembering their relationship, would\r\nanswer for his personal safety, and obtain as good terms for him as\r\ncould be reasonably expected. These conditions were approved by\r\nDionysius, who again sent ambassadors to demand that some of the\r\nSyracusans should come to the citadel and arrange the terms of the\r\nsurrender upon a basis of mutual concessions. Commissioners, chosen by\r\nDion, were at once sent to him, and a report spread from the citadel\r\nthat Dionysius intended to abdicate and to make himself more popular\r\neven than Dion. However, the negotiations were all a trick of the despot\r\nto take the Syracusans at a disadvantage. He imprisoned the\r\ncommissioners, and at daybreak, having excited his mercenary troops with\r\nwine, sent them at a run to attack the Syracusan wall across the\r\nisthmus. This attack was unexpected, and the foreign troops boldly and\r\nwith loud shouts began to destroy the works and to attack the\r\nSyracusans. No one could withstand their onset except the mercenaries of\r\nDion, who were the first to hear the noise of the conflict and to rush\r\nto the spot. But not even these men could perceive what was to be done\r\nor obey their orders, mixed up as they were with noisy crowds of\r\npanic-stricken Syracusan fugitives, before Dion, finding that no one\r\nheeded his words, and wishing to show by his actions what ought to be\r\ndone, was the first man to attack the foreigners. Round him a fierce and\r\nterrible battle took place, as he was recognised as well by the enemy as\r\nby his friends, and all ran towards him with shouts. He was, indeed,\r\nsomewhat advanced in years to engage in such a furious combat, but yet\r\nstoutly and bravely withstood and repulsed all who attacked him. He\r\nreceived a wound in the hand from a spear, and had to rely upon his\r\nbreastplate for protection against showers of darts and blows in close\r\ncombat, for his shield was pierced through by many spears and lances.\r\nWhen these were broken he fell to the ground, but was snatched away by\r\nhis soldiers. He appointed Timonides to take his place, and himself rode\r\nthrough the city on horseback, rallied the Syracusan fugitives, brought\r\nout the garrison of mercenaries from Achradina, and led these fresh and\r\nconfident troops against the wearied foreigners, who had already begun\r\nto despair of victory. They had imagined that by their first attack they\r\nwould be able to overrun the whole city, but having unexpectedly fallen\r\nin with men who could deal hard blows they began to retire towards the\r\ncitadel. As they gave way the Greeks pressed upon them still more, until\r\nat length they were driven in confusion into the citadel, after killing\r\nseventy-four of Dion's party, and losing many of their own men.\r\n\r\nXXXI. After this glorious victory the Syracusans presented the\r\nmercenaries with a hundred minæ, and the mercenaries presented Dion\r\nwith a golden crown. Heralds from Dionysius now came from the citadel\r\nbringing letters to Dion from his female relatives. One of these bore\r\nthe superscription \"From Hipparinus to his father;\" for this was the\r\nname of Dion's son, although Timæus says that he was named Aretæus\r\nafter his mother Arete. But I imagine we ought rather to believe\r\nTimonides in such matters as these, since he was a friend and comrade of\r\nDion. The other letters, those from the women, which were full of\r\npiteous supplications, were read aloud to the Syracusans, but they were\r\nunwilling that the letter from the child should be opened before them.\r\nIn spite of their opposition, Dion opened it and read it aloud. It was\r\nfrom Dionysius himself, addressed nominally to Dion, but really to the\r\npeople of Syracuse, and though in it Dionysius seemed to appeal to Dion\r\nand to plead his own cause with him, yet in truth it was concocted with\r\na view to rendering him suspected by the people; for it contained\r\nallusions to his former zeal on behalf of the monarchy, and also\r\nthreatened him through the persons of those dearest to him, his sister,\r\nhis child and his wife. There were in the letter also pitiful\r\nentreaties, and what especially moved him to anger, supplications to him\r\nnot to destroy the monarchy and set free a people which hated him and\r\nwould turn and rend him, but to become despot himself, and thus to save\r\nhis relatives and friends.\r\n\r\nXXXII. When these letters were read to them, the Syracusans, instead of\r\nadmiring Dion for his magnanimity in adhering to the cause of honour and\r\nright, in spite of such touching appeals as these, they rather began to\r\nsuspect him and to fear him, because he had such powerful reasons for\r\nsparing the despot, and they began to look around them for some other\r\nleader. They became particularly excited on hearing that Herakleides\r\nsailed into the harbour. This Herakleides was a Syracusan exile, a\r\nmilitary man who had gained a great reputation by the commands which he\r\nhad held in the service of Dionysius and his father, but of an unsettled\r\ndisposition, fickle and least of all to be relied upon when associated\r\nwith a colleague in any command of dignity and honour. This man had\r\nquarrelled with Dion in Peloponnesus, and determined to make an\r\nexpedition of his own to attack Dionysius. He now arrived at Syracuse\r\nwith seven triremes and three other vessels,[493] and found Dionysius\r\nblockaded in his citadel and the people of Syracuse in an excited\r\ncondition. He at once received the popular favour, being naturally\r\nplausible and well able to impose upon a people who were fond of\r\nflattery. He was the more easily enabled to do this, as the Syracusans\r\nwere already disgusted with the haughty demeanour of Dion, which they\r\nconsidered to be offensive and unfit for a statesman, being themselves\r\ngrown insubordinate and insolent after their victory and requiring a\r\ndemagogue even before they had become a democracy.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Their first act was to assemble of their own accord and elect\r\nHerakleides as admiral. When, however, Dion came forward and complained\r\nthat the appointment of Herakleides was a revocation of the powers\r\ngranted to himself, since he would no longer be general with unlimited\r\npowers, if another commanded by sea, the Syracusans, much against their\r\nwill, annulled the election. After this Dion sent for Herakleides\r\nprivately and, after bitterly reproaching him with his want of honour\r\nand right feeling in raising disputes about precedence during so\r\nmomentous and dangerous a crisis, again assembled the people, appointed\r\nHerakleides admiral and prevailed upon the citizens to grant him a\r\nbodyguard such as that by which he himself was attended. Herakleides\r\nnow in words and in manner acknowledged Dion as his superior, obeyed his\r\norders with humility, and owned that he owed him a debt of gratitude;\r\nbut in secret he encouraged the people to revolt against him, stirred up\r\ntumults and brought Dion into a most difficult position; for if he were\r\nto permit Dionysius to retire from the citadel under a flag of truce, he\r\nfeared that he should be reproached with sparing the despot and saving\r\nhim from the fate he deserved, while, if he did not push the siege\r\nthrough a wish not to drive him to extremities, he would appear to be\r\npurposely protracting the war in order that he might the longer remain\r\nin power and have the people under his orders.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. There was one Sosis, a man who by villainy and audacity had\r\ngained a certain reputation at Syracuse, where the citizens thought that\r\nhis licence in speech must be prompted by an excessive love of freedom.\r\nThis man began to intrigue against Dion, and first of all rose in the\r\nassembly and violently abused the Syracusans for not perceiving that\r\nthey had got a sober and vigilant despot instead of a drunken and\r\nimbecile one. After this, having avowed himself Dion's open enemy, he\r\nwithdrew from the market-place and next day was seen running naked\r\nthrough the city with his face and head covered with blood, as though he\r\nwere fleeing from some pursuers. Rushing into the market-place in this\r\ncondition, he said that his life had been attempted by Dion's\r\nmercenaries, and showed his wounded head to the people. He at once\r\ngained an audience of sympathisers, who became furious with Dion, and\r\ndeclared that he was acting shamefully and despotically in restraining\r\nthe freedom of speech of the citizens by threats and murders. However,\r\nthough a disorderly assembly took place, Dion was able to speak in his\r\nown defence, pointing out that a brother of Sosis was one of the guards\r\nof Dionysius, and that this man must have persuaded him to rebel and\r\nthrow the city into confusion, since Dionysius could have no hope of\r\nsafety except in the dissensions of the besiegers. At the same time the\r\nphysicians examined the wound of Sosis, and found that it was the result\r\nof a superficial scratch rather than of a downward cut; for wounds by\r\nswordstrokes are deepest in the middle, because of the weight of the\r\nblow, while this wound of Sosis was shallow throughout all its length\r\nand had several beginnings, as probably he had been forced by the pain\r\nto leave off cutting his head and then had begun again. Some of the more\r\nrespectable citizens also came to the assembly with a razor, and said\r\nthat while they were walking they met Sosis covered with blood, saying\r\nthat he was fleeing from Dion's mercenaries and had just been wounded by\r\nthem. They at once proceeded to look for them, and found no man, but saw\r\nthe razor hidden under a hollow stone at the place from which Sosis had\r\nbeen seen coming out.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Matters now began to look ill for Sosis; and when his slaves,\r\nafter torture, declared that he left the house while it was yet night\r\ncarrying a razor, Dion's accusers withdrew their charges against him,\r\nand the people became reconciled with Dion and condemned Sosis to death.\r\nNevertheless, they viewed the mercenaries with suspicion, especially\r\nafter the great battles which took place at sea, when Philistus came\r\nfrom Iapygia with many triremes to rescue Dionysius, upon which they\r\nimagined that the mercenaries, being heavy-infantry soldiers, would be\r\nof no further use in the war, and would soon become their enemies, as\r\nthey were all seafaring people, whose strength lay in their ships. They\r\nwere further excited by their success in a sea-fight, in which they\r\ndefeated Philistus, and treated him with the utmost barbarity. Ephorus\r\nstates that Philistus killed himself as soon as his ship was captured,\r\nbut Timonides, who was present with Dion throughout the whole of these\r\nevents, in a letter which he wrote to the philospher, Speusippus,\r\ninforms him that Philistus was taken alive from his ship which ran\r\nashore; and that the Syracusans first stripped him of his corslet and\r\ndisplayed him naked, jeering at him, he being then an old man; and that\r\nafter this they cut off his head and gave up the body to the boys of the\r\ntown, bidding them drag it through Achradina, and cast it into the stone\r\nquarries. Timæus declares that Philistus was treated with even greater\r\nindignity, his dead body being dragged by the boys through the city by\r\nthe lame leg amidst the insults of all the people of Syracuse, who were\r\npleased to see this treatment inflicted on the man who had told\r\nDionysius that far from requiring a swift horse to escape from his\r\nthrone, he ought to remain until he was dragged from it by the leg.\r\nPhilistus, however, gave this advice to Dionysius, not as having been\r\nsaid by himself, but by some one else.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. Philistus doubtless laid himself open to blame by his zealous\r\nadherence to the cause of the monarchy, but Timæus takes advantage of\r\nthis to satisfy his own spite by abusing him. It might, perhaps, be\r\npardoned if those who had been wronged by him were so transported by\r\nrage as even to insult his senseless corpse; but a historian, writing an\r\naccount of his actions in a later age, without having been in any way\r\npersonally injured by him, ought to be restrained by feelings of honour\r\nand decency from taunting him with his misfortunes, which, indeed, might\r\nequally have befallen the best of men. Neither does Ephorus show a sound\r\njudgment in praising Philistus, for, in spite of his skill in inventing\r\ngood motives for evil conduct and actions, and the care with which his\r\nwords are chosen, he cannot, with all his art, gloss over the fact that\r\nPhilistus was devotedly attached to the cause of despotism, and that he,\r\nmore than any one else, was dazzled and attracted by wealth, power,\r\nluxury and marriages with the daughters of absolute princes. A historian\r\nwould show better taste than either of these by neither praising\r\nPhilistus for his conduct nor reproaching him with his misfortunes.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. After the death of Philistus, Dionysius sent to Dion offering to\r\ndeliver up to him the citadel, the arms which it contained, the\r\nmercenary troops and five months pay for them, and demanding to be\r\nallowed to retire unmolested to Italy and live there, and also to\r\nreceive the revenues of a large and fertile tract belonging to Syracuse\r\ncalled Gyarta, which extended from the sea-side to the interior of the\r\nisland. Dion would not receive the embassy, but bade Dionysius address\r\nhimself to the people of Syracuse; and they, hoping to take Dionysius\r\nalive, drove away his ambassadors. Dionysius now handed over the citadel\r\nto Apollokrates, his eldest son, and himself placed what persons and\r\nproperty he chiefly valued on board ship, waited for a fair wind, and\r\nthen sailed away, eluding the vigilance of the admiral Herakleides.\r\nHerakleides was fiercely reproached by the citizens for his neglect, but\r\nsuborned one of the popular speakers to make proposals to the people for\r\na division of lands, pointing out that equality is the source of\r\nfreedom, and that poverty reduces men to slavery. Herakleides spoke on\r\nthe same side, openly opposed Dion, who led the opposite faction, and\r\nprevailed upon the Syracusans to agree to this proposal, and further to\r\nrefuse to pay the mercenary troops and to rid themselves of the haughty\r\narrogance of Dion by electing new generals. Thus, like a man who\r\nattempts to rise and walk when weakened by a long illness, the\r\nSyracusans, after ridding themselves of their despotism, at once tried\r\nto adopt the institutions of free peoples, and both failed in their\r\nundertakings and disliked Dion, because he, like a careful physician,\r\nwished to impose a strict and temperate regimen upon them.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. When they assembled to choose their new commanders the time\r\nwas about midsummer, and ominous thunderstorms and portents took place\r\nfor fifteen days in succession, dispersing the people and preventing\r\ntheir election of any other generals. When the popular leaders, by\r\nwaiting and watching, had obtained a fair still day for the election of\r\nchief magistrates, a draught ox, who was quite tame and accustomed to\r\ncrowds, but who was enraged with his driver, broke from his yoke and ran\r\ntowards the theatre. He scattered the people in the greatest confusion\r\nand panic, and ran on prancing and causing disorder through all that\r\npart of the city which afterwards fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\nNevertheless, the Syracusans disregarded this omen, and elected\r\nfive-and-twenty generals, one of whom was Herakleides. They also made\r\nsecret overtures to Dion's mercenaries, inviting them to desert, and\r\noffering them equal rights with the other citizens. They, however, would\r\nnot listen to these proposals, but faithfully and promptly got under\r\narms, formed column with Dion in their midst, and began to march out of\r\nthe city, without harming any one, but bitterly reproaching all whom\r\nthey met with their ingratitude and wickedness. But the Syracusans, who\r\ndespised them for their small numbers and for not having been the first\r\nto attack, had now collected in crowds, far outnumbering the\r\nmercenaries, and set upon them, expecting that in a street-fight they\r\nwould easily be able to overpower them and to kill them all.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. In this terrible dilemma, as he was forced either to fight\r\nagainst his fellow-countrymen or to perish with his mercenaries, Dion\r\nstretched out his hands towards the Syracusans and implored them to\r\ndesist, and pointed to the citadel, full of armed enemies, who were\r\nwatching them from the battlements. As, however, the excited mob could\r\nnot be turned from its purpose, for the speeches of the demagogues\r\nstirred up the people as the wind stirs up the waves of the sea, Dion\r\nordered his troops not to charge them, but to march forward with a shout\r\nand martial clash of arms. At this none of the Syracusans stood their\r\nground, but ran away along the streets unpursued; for Dion at once\r\nwheeled round his troops and marched away to Leontini. The new chiefs of\r\nthe Syracusans, ridiculed by the women, and wishing to wipe out their\r\ndisgrace, now again got the citizens under arms and pursued Dion. They\r\ncame up with him as he was crossing a stream, and rode up to his troops\r\nin skirmishing order. When, however, they perceived that Dion was no\r\nlonger willing to deal gently and paternally with their follies, but\r\nthat he angrily formed his troops in line and ordered them to attack,\r\nthey fled more disgracefully than before back to their city, without\r\nlosing many of their number.\r\n\r\nXL. The people of Leontini received Dion with especial honours, provided\r\nhis troops with pay, and made them free of the city. They also sent\r\nambassadors to the Syracusans, calling upon them to do the soldiers\r\njustice; to which they replied by sending ambassadors to prefer charges\r\nagainst Dion. When, however, all the allies held a meeting at Leontini\r\nand discussed the matter, the Syracusans were held to be in fault. But\r\nthe Syracusans refused to accept this decision, as they were now full of\r\ninsolent importance, having no one to rule them, but being led by\r\ngenerals who were the merest slaves of the people.\r\n\r\nXLI. After this a fleet of triremes sent by Dionysius arrived at the\r\ncity, under the command of Nypsius, a Neapolitan, with supplies of corn\r\nand money for the besieged. In a sea-fight which took place the\r\nSyracusans were victorious, and took four of the ships, but were so\r\nelated by their victory, and, having none to rule them, celebrated their\r\nsuccess with such reckless excesses of drinking and feasting, that while\r\nthey imagined they had taken the citadel they really lost the city as\r\nwell; for Nypsius, observing that discipline was everywhere at an end,\r\nas the populace were engaged in drinking to the sound of music from\r\ndaylight until late at night, and that the generals were delighted at\r\nthe festivity and were unwilling to summon the drunken men to their\r\nduty, seized his opportunity and attacked the Syracusan wall of\r\ninvestment. His attack succeeded; he broke through the works, and at\r\nonce let loose his foreign mercenaries, bidding them deal as they\r\npleased with all whom they met. The Syracusans, though they soon learned\r\ntheir misfortune, yet were slow to assemble, being taken by surprise;\r\nfor the city was being sacked, the men slaughtered, the walls thrown\r\ndown and the women and children being forced weeping into the citadel,\r\nwhile the generals gave up all for lost, and could make no use of the\r\ncitizens, who were everywhere confusedly mixed up with the enemy.\r\n\r\nXLII. While the city was in this condition, and the danger began to\r\nmenace Achradina also, all men thought of him who was their last and\r\nonly hope, but no one spoke of Dion, as they were all ashamed of the\r\nfolly and ingratitude with which they had treated him. Sheer necessity,\r\nhowever, forced some of the auxiliary troops and the knights[494] to cry\r\nout that they must send for Dion and his Peloponnesians from Leontini.\r\nAs soon as any were found bold enough to raise this cry, the Syracusans\r\nshouted aloud, and rejoiced with tears, for they prayed that Dion would\r\ncome, they longed to see him, and they remembered his courage and\r\nstrength in time of danger, in which he not only remained calm and\r\nunmoved, but gave them confidence by his demeanour and caused them\r\nfearlessly and bravely to attack their enemies. They therefore at once\r\nsent off to him Archonides and Telesides, as representatives of the\r\nallies, and Hellanikus, with four others, of the knights. These men rode\r\nat full gallop to Leontini, arriving there late in the afternoon. When\r\nthey dismounted, the first person they met was Dion, and with tears in\r\ntheir eyes they told him of the misfortunes which had befallen the\r\nSyracusans. Soon some of the citizens of Leontini fell in with them, and\r\nmany of the Peloponnesians gathered round Dion, suspecting from the\r\nearnest and supplicatory tones and gestures of the ambassadors that\r\nsomething important had happened. Dion at once led the way to the public\r\nassembly, where all the people soon met together. Archonides and\r\nHellanikus in a few words informed them of the great misfortune which\r\nhad befallen the Syracusans, and besought the stranger mercenaries to\r\nhelp them and not to bear malice for the treatment which they had\r\nreceived, since the Syracusans had been more terribly punished for their\r\nmisconduct than even the soldiers could have wished them to be.\r\n\r\nXLIII. After they had ceased speaking, there was a great silence; and\r\nwhen Dion rose and began to speak, tears choked his utterance. The\r\nPeloponnesians encouraged him, and showed sympathy with him, and at\r\nlength he mastered his emotion and said: \"Men of Peloponnesus and\r\nAllies, I have assembled you here to deliberate about your own affairs.\r\nAs for myself, I cannot with honour deliberate while Syracuse is being\r\ndestroyed, but if I cannot save my country, I will share her ruin and\r\nmake her flames my own funeral pyre. As for you, if you can bring\r\nyourselves even now, after all that has passed, to help us, the most\r\nill-advised and the most ill-fated of men, restore again by your own\r\nmeans alone the city of Syracuse. But if you hate the Syracusans and\r\nreject their appeal, then may you be rewarded by heaven for your former\r\nbrave conduct and loyalty to me, and may you remember Dion, who would\r\nnot desert you when you were wronged, and would not afterwards desert\r\nhis fellow-countrymen when they were in trouble.\" While Dion was still\r\nspeaking, the Peloponnesians leaped up with a shout, bidding him lead\r\nthem as quickly as possible to the rescue, and the ambassadors from\r\nSyracuse embraced him, calling upon heaven to bless both him and the\r\ntroops. When order was restored, Dion immediately began to prepare for\r\nthe march, and ordered his men to go and eat their dinners at once, and\r\nthen to assemble under arms in that very place; for he intended to march\r\nto Syracuse by night.\r\n\r\nXLIV. Meanwhile at Syracuse the generals of Dionysius worked great ruin\r\nin the city while it was day, but when darkness came on retired into the\r\ncitadel, having lost but few men. The popular leaders now took courage,\r\nand, expecting that the enemy would attempt nothing further, again\r\ncalled upon the people to have nothing to do with Dion, and, if he came\r\nwith his foreign troops, not to admit him into the city and own\r\nthemselves inferior to his men in courage, but to reconquer their city\r\nand their liberty by their own exertions. More embassies were now sent\r\nto Dion, from the generals dissuading him from coming, and from the\r\nknights and leading citizens entreating him to come quickly. This caused\r\nhim to march more slowly, yet with greater determination. When day\r\nbroke, the party opposed to Dion occupied the gates, in order to shut\r\nhim out of the city, while Nypsius a second time led out the mercenaries\r\nfrom the citadel, in greater numbers and far more confident than before.\r\nHe at once levelled to the ground the whole of the works by which the\r\ncitadel was cut off from the main land, and overran and pillaged the\r\ncity. No longer men alone, but even women and children were slaughtered,\r\nand property of every kind mercilessly destroyed; for Dionysius, who now\r\ndespaired of ultimate success, and bitterly hated the Syracusans, wished\r\nonly, as it were, to bury the monarchy in the ruins of the city. In\r\norder to effect their purpose before Dion could come to the rescue, the\r\nsoldiers destroyed the houses in the quickest way by setting them on\r\nfire, using torches for those near at hand, and shooting fiery arrows to\r\nthose at a distance. As the Syracusans fled from their burning\r\ndwellings, some were caught and butchered in the streets, while others\r\nwho took refuge in the houses perished in the flames, as now a large\r\nnumber of houses were burning, and kept falling upon the passers by.\r\n\r\nXLV. This misfortune more than anything else caused all to be unanimous\r\nin opening the gates to Dion. He had been marching slowly, as he heard\r\nthat the enemy were shut up in the citadel; but as the day went on, at\r\nfirst some of the knights rode up to him and told him of the second\r\noccupation of the city; and afterwards some even of the opposite faction\r\narrived and begged him to hasten his march. As the danger became more\r\npressing, Herakleides sent first his brother, and afterwards his uncle\r\nTheodotus, to beseech Dion to assist them, and to tell him that no one\r\nany longer could offer any resistance, that Herakleides himself was\r\nwounded, and that the whole city was within a little of being totally\r\nruined and burned. When these messages reached Dion he was still sixty\r\nstadia distant from the gates of Syracuse. He explained to his troops\r\nthe danger the city was in, spoke some words of encouragement to them,\r\nand then led them on, no longer at a walk, but at a run, while messenger\r\nafter messenger continued to meet them and urge them to haste. At the\r\nhead of his mercenaries, who displayed extraordinary speed and spirit,\r\nDion made his way through the gates of Syracuse to the place called\r\nHekatompedon. He at once sent his light-armed troops to attack the\r\nenemy, and to encourage the Syracusans by their presence, while he\r\nhimself formed his own heavy infantry, and those of the citizens who\r\nrallied round him in separate columns under several commanders, in order\r\nto create greater terror by attacking the enemy at many points at once.\r\n\r\nXLVI. When, after making these preparations, and offering prayer to the\r\ngods, he was beheld leading his troops through the city to attack the\r\nenemy, the Syracusans raised a shout of joy, with a confused murmur of\r\nprayers, entreaties and congratulations, addressing Dion as their\r\nsaviour and their tutelary god, and calling the foreign soldiers their\r\nbrethren and fellow-citizens. All of them, even the most selfish and\r\ncowardly, now appeared to hold Dion's life dearer than his own or that\r\nof his fellow-citizens, as they saw him lead the way to danger through\r\nblood and fire, and over the corpses which lay in heaps in the streets.\r\nThe enemy, too, presented a formidable appearance, for they were\r\nexasperated to fury, and had established themselves in a strong\r\nposition, hard even to approach, amidst the ruins of the rampart by\r\nwhich the citadel had been cut off from the town; while the progress of\r\nthe mercenary troops was rendered difficult and dangerous by the flames\r\nof the burning houses by which they were surrounded. They were forced to\r\nleap over heaps of blazing beams, and to run from under great masses of\r\nfalling ruins, struggling forwards through thick smoke and choking dust,\r\nand yet striving to keep their ranks unbroken. When at length they\r\nreached the enemy, only a few could fight on either side, because of the\r\nnarrowness of the path, but the Syracusans, pushing confidently forward\r\nwith loud shouts, forced the troops of Nypsius to give way. Most of them\r\nescaped into the citadel, which was close at hand: but all the\r\nstragglers who were left outside, were pursued and put to death by the\r\nPeloponnesians. The Syracusans could not spare any time to enjoy their\r\nvictory and to congratulate one another after such great successes, but\r\nbetook themselves at once to extinguishing their burning houses, and\r\nwith great exertions put out the fire during the night.\r\n\r\nXLVII. As soon as day broke, all the popular leaders, conscious of their\r\nguilt, left the city, with the exception of Herakleides and Theodotus,\r\nwho went of their own accord and delivered themselves up to Dion,\r\nadmitting that they had done wrong, and begging that he would treat them\r\nbetter than they had treated him. They pointed out, also, how much he\r\nwould enhance the lustre of his other incomparable virtues by showing\r\nhimself superior even in the matter of temper to those by whom he had\r\nbeen wronged, who now came before him admitting that in their rivalry\r\nwith him they had been overcome by his virtue. When Herakleides and his\r\ncompanion thus threw themselves upon the mercy of Dion, his friends\r\nadvised him not to spare such envious and malignant wretches, but to\r\ndeliver up Herakleides to his soldiers, and thus to put an end to mob\r\nrule, an evil quite as pestilent as despotism itself. Dion, however,\r\ncalmed their anger, observing that other generals spent most of their\r\ntime in practising war and the use of arms; but that he, during his long\r\nsojourn in the Academy, had learned to subdue his passions, and to show\r\nhimself superior to jealousy of his rivals. True greatness of mind, he\r\nsaid, could be better shown by forgiving those by whom one has been\r\nwronged, than by doing good to one's friends and benefactors; and he\r\ndesired not so much to excel Herakleides in power and generalship, as in\r\nclemency and justice, the only qualities which are truly good: for our\r\nsuccesses in war, even if won by ourselves alone, yet can only be won by\r\nthe aid of Fortune. \"If,\" he continued, \"Herakleides be jealous,\r\ntreacherous and base, that is no reason for Dion to stain his glory by\r\nyielding to his anger; for though to revenge a wrong is held to be less\r\nculpable than to commit one, yet both alike spring from the weakness of\r\nhuman nature: while even though a man be wicked, yet he is seldom so\r\nhopelessly depraved as not to be touched by one who repeatedly returns\r\ngood for evil.\"\r\n\r\nXLVIII. After expressing himself thus, Dion released Herakleides. He\r\nnext turned his attention to the fortification by which the citadel was\r\ncut off, and ordered each Syracusan to cut a stake and bring it to the\r\nspot. He allowed the citizens to rest during the night, but kept his\r\nmercenary soldiers at work, and by the next morning had completed the\r\npalisade, so that both the enemy and his own countrymen were astonished\r\nat the speed with which he had accomplished so great a work. He now\r\nburied the corpses of those citizens who had fallen in the battle,\r\nransomed the prisoners, who amounted to no less than two thousand, and\r\nsummoned an assembly, in which Herakleides proposed that Dion should be\r\nappointed absolute commander by land and by sea. All the better citizens\r\napproved of this, and wished it to be put to the vote, but it was thrown\r\nout by the interference of the mob of sailors and people of the lower\r\nclasses, who were sorry that Herakleides had lost his post as admiral,\r\nand who thought that, although he might be worthless in all other\r\nrespects, he was at any rate more of a friend to the people than Dion,\r\nand more easily managed by them. Dion conceded so much to them as to\r\ngive Herakleides command of the fleet, but vexed them much by opposing\r\ntheir plans for a redistribution of land and houses, and by declaring\r\nvoid all that they had decided upon this subject. In consequence of this\r\nHerakleides, who at once entered upon his office of admiral, sailed to\r\nMessenia, and there by his harangues excited the sailors and soldiers\r\nunder his command to mutiny against Dion, who, he declared, intended to\r\nmake himself despot of Syracuse; while he, in the meanwhile, entered\r\nupon negotiations with Dionysius by means of the Spartan Pharax. When\r\nthis was discovered by the Syracusan nobility, a violent quarrel arose\r\nin his camp, which led to the people of Syracuse being reduced to great\r\nwant and scarcity, so that Dion was at his wit's end, and was bitterly\r\nreproached by his friends for having placed such an unmanageable and\r\nvillainous rival as Herakleides in possession of power which he used\r\nagainst his benefactor.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Pharax was now encamped at Neapolis, in the territory of\r\nAgrigentum, and Dion, who led out the Syracusans to oppose him, wished\r\nto defer an engagement; but Herakleides and the sailors overwhelmed him\r\nwith their clamour, saying that he did not wish to bring the war to an\r\nend by a battle, but to keep it constantly going on in order that he\r\nmight remain the longer in command. He therefore fought and was beaten.\r\nThe defeat was not a disastrous one, but was due more to the confusion\r\nproduced by the quarrels of his own men than to the enemy. Dion\r\ntherefore prepared to renew the engagement, drew out his men in battle\r\narray, and addressed them in encouraging terms. Towards evening,\r\nhowever, he heard that Herakleides had weighed anchor and sailed away to\r\nSyracuse with the fleet, with the intention of seizing the city and\r\nshutting its gates against Dion and the army. Dion at once took the\r\nstrongest and bravest men with him, and rode all night, reaching the\r\ngates of Syracuse about the third hour of the next day, after a journey\r\nof seven hundred stadia. Herakleides, who in spite of the exertions of\r\nhis fleet was beaten in the race, was at a loss what to do, and sailed\r\naway aimlessly. He chanced to fall in with the Spartan Gæsylus, who\r\ninformed him that he was coming from Lacedæmon to take command of the\r\nSicilian Greeks, as Gylippus had done in former times. Herakleides was\r\ndelighted at having met this man, and displayed him to his troops,\r\nboasting that he had found a counterpoise to the power of Dion, he at\r\nonce sent a herald to Syracuse, and ordered the citizens to receive the\r\nSpartan as their ruler. When Dion answered that the Syracusans had\r\nrulers enough, and that in case they should require a Spartan to command\r\nthem, he himself was a Spartan by adoption, Gæsylus gave up all claims\r\nto command, but went to Dion and reconciled Herakleides to him, making\r\nHerakleides swear the greatest oaths and give the strongest pledges for\r\nhis future good behaviour, while Gæsylus himself swore that he would\r\navenge Dion and punish Herakleides in case the latter should misconduct\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nL. After this the Syracusans disbanded their navy, which was quite\r\nuseless; besides being very expensive to the crews, and giving\r\nopportunities for the formation of plots against the government; but\r\nthey continued the siege of the citadel, and thoroughly completed the\r\nwall across the isthmus. As no assistance arrived for the besieged,\r\nwhile their provisions began to fail, and their troops became inclined\r\nto mutiny, the son of Dionysius despaired of success, arranged terms of\r\ncapitulation with Dion, handed over the citadel to him together with all\r\nthe arms and other war material which it contained, and himself, taking\r\nhis mother and sisters and their property on board of five triremes,\r\nsailed away to his father. Dion permitted him to leave in safety, and\r\nhis departure was witnessed by every one of the Syracusans, who even\r\ncalled upon the names of those who were absent, and were unable to see\r\nthis day when the sun rose upon a free Syracuse. Indeed the downfall of\r\nDionysius is one of the most remarkable instances of the vicissitudes of\r\nfortune known in history; and what then must we suppose was the joy and\r\npride of the Syracusans, when they reflected that with such slender\r\nmeans they had overthrown the most powerful dynasty at that time\r\nexisting in the world?\r\n\r\nLI. After Apollokrates had sailed away and Dion had entered the citadel,\r\nthe women could endure no longer to wait indoors till he came to them,\r\nbut ran to the gates, Aristomache leading Dion's son, and Arete\r\nfollowing behind her in tears, and at a loss to know how she should\r\ngreet her husband after she had been married to another. After Dion had\r\nembraced his sister and his child, Aristomache led Arete forward, and\r\nsaid, \"Dion, we were unhappy while you were an exile; but now that you\r\nhave returned and conquered you have taken away our reproach from all\r\nbut Arete here, whom I have had the misery to see forced to accept\r\nanother husband while you were yet alive. Now, therefore, since fortune\r\nhas placed us in your power, how do you propose to settle this\r\ndifficulty? Is she to embrace you as her uncle or as her husband also?\"\r\nDion shed tears at these words of Aristomache, and affectionately\r\nembraced his wife. He placed his son in her hands, and bade her go to\r\nhis own house, where he himself also continued to live; for he delivered\r\nup the citadel to the people of Syracuse.\r\n\r\nLII. After he had thus accomplished his enterprise, he reaped no\r\nadvantage from his success, except that he conferred favours on his\r\nfriends and rewarded his allies; while he bestowed upon his own\r\ncompanions, both Syracusan and Peloponnesian, such signal marks of his\r\ngratitude that his generosity even outran his means. He himself\r\ncontinued to live simply and frugally, while not only Sicily and\r\nCarthage, but all Greece viewed with admiration the manner in which he\r\nbore his prosperity, considering his achievements to be the greatest,\r\nand himself to be the most splendid instance of successful daring known\r\nto that age. He remained as modest in his dress, his household, and his\r\ntable, as though he were still the guest of Plato in the Academy, and\r\nnot living among mercenary soldiers, who recompense themselves for the\r\nhardships and dangers of their lives by daily indulgence in sensual\r\npleasures. Plato wrote a letter to him, in which he informed him that\r\nthe eyes of all the world were fixed upon him; but Plato probably only\r\nalluded to one place in one city, namely the Academy, and meant that the\r\ncritics and judges of Dion therein assembled did not admire his\r\nexertions or his victory, but only considered whether he bore himself\r\ndiscreetly and modestly in his success, and showed moderation now that\r\nhe was all-powerful. Dion made a point of maintaining the same haughty\r\ndemeanour in society, and of treating the people with the same severity\r\nas before, although the times demanded that he should unbend, and though\r\nPlato, as we have said before, wrote to him bidding him remember that an\r\narrogant temper is the consort of a lonely life. However, Dion appears\r\nto have been naturally inclined to harshness, and besides was desirous\r\nof reforming the manners of the Syracusans, who were excessively\r\nlicentious and corrupt.\r\n\r\nLIII. Now Herakleides again opposed him. When Dion sent for him to\r\nattend at the council, he refused to come, declaring that he was a mere\r\nprivate man, and would go only to the public assembly with the other\r\ncitizens. Next he reproached Dion for not having demolished the citadel,\r\nfor having restrained the people when they wished to break open the tomb\r\nof Dionysius (the elder) and cast out his body, and for having insulted\r\nhis own fellow-countrymen by sending to Corinth for counsellors and\r\ncolleagues. Indeed, Dion had sent to Corinth for some commissioners from\r\nthat city, hoping that their presence would assist him in effecting the\r\nreforms which he meditated. Like Plato, he regarded a pure democracy as\r\nnot being a government at all, but rather a warehouse of all forms of\r\ngovernment: and his intention was to establish a constitution, somewhat\r\non the Lacedæmonian or Cretan model, by a judicious combination of\r\nmonarchy and oligarchy: and he saw that the government of Corinth was\r\nmore of an oligarchy than a democracy, and that few important measures\r\nwere submitted to the people. As Dion expected that Herakleides would\r\nmost vehemently oppose these projects, and was moreover a turbulent,\r\nfickle, and facetious personage, he gave him up to those who had long\r\nbefore desired to kill him, but whom he had formerly restrained from\r\ndoing so. These men broke into the house of Herakleides and killed him.\r\nThe Syracusans were deeply grieved at his death; yet, as Dion gave him a\r\nsplendid funeral, followed the corpse at the head of his army, and\r\nafterwards made a speech to the people, they forgave him, reflecting\r\nthat their city could never have obtained rest while Dion and\r\nHerakleides were both engaged in political life.\r\n\r\nLIV. One of Dion's companions was an Athenian named Kallippus, who, we\r\nare told by Plato, became intimate with him, not because of his\r\nlearning, but because he happened to have initiated Dion into some\r\nreligious mysteries. This man took part in Dion's expedition, and\r\nreceived especial honours, being the first of all Dion's comrades who\r\nmarched into Syracuse with him, wearing a garland on his head, and he\r\nhad always distinguished himself in the combats which took place since\r\nthat time. Now, seeing that the noblest and best of Dion's friends had\r\nfallen in the war, and that by the death of Herakleides the Syracusan\r\npeople were deprived of their leader, while he had greater influence\r\nthan any one else with Dion's mercenary soldiers, Kallippus conceived a\r\nscheme of detestable villainy. No doubt he hoped to obtain the whole of\r\nSicily as his reward for murdering Dion, though some writers state that\r\nhe received a bribe of twenty talents from Dion's personal enemies. He\r\nnow drew several of the mercenary soldiers into a conspiracy against\r\nDion, conducting his plot in a most ingenious and treacherous manner.\r\nHe was in the habit of informing Dion of any treasonable speeches,\r\nwhether true or invented by himself, which he said that he had heard\r\nfrom the mercenary troops, and by this means gained such entire\r\nconfidence with him, that he was able to hold secret meetings and plot\r\nagainst Dion with whichever of the soldiers he pleased, having Dion's\r\nexpress command to do so, in order that none of the disaffected party\r\nmight escape his notice. By this means Kallippus was easily enabled to\r\nfind out all the worst and most discontented of the mercenaries, and to\r\norganise a conspiracy amongst them; while, if any man refused to listen\r\nto his proposals and denounced him to Dion, he took no heed of it and\r\nshowed no anger, believing that Kallippus was merely carrying out his\r\nown instructions.\r\n\r\nLV. When the plot was formed, Dion beheld a great and portentous vision.\r\nLate in the evening he was sitting alone in the hall[495] of his house,\r\nplunged in thought. Suddenly he heard a noise on the other side of the\r\ncourt, and, looking up, as it was not quite dark, saw a tall woman, with\r\nthe face and dress of a Fury as represented upon the stage, sweeping the\r\nhouse with a kind of broom. He was terribly startled, and became so much\r\nalarmed that he sent for his friends, described the vision to them, and\r\nbesought them to remain with him during the night, as he was beside\r\nhimself with fright, and dreaded lest if he were alone the apparition\r\nmight return. This, however, did not take place. A few days after this\r\nhis son, now almost grown up, took offence at some trifling affront, and\r\ndestroyed himself by throwing himself headlong from the roof of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nLVI. While Dion was thus alarmed and distressed, Kallippus all the more\r\neagerly carried out his plot. He spread a rumour among the Syracusans\r\nthat Dion, being childless, had determined to recall Apollokrates, the\r\nson of Dionysius, and to make him his heir, since he was his wife's\r\nnephew, and his sister's grandson. By this time Dion and the women of\r\nhis household began to entertain some suspicion of the plot, and\r\ninformation of it reached them from all quarters. Dion, however, grieved\r\nat the murder of Herakleides, as though that crime had stained his\r\nglory, had become low-spirited and miserable, and frequently said that\r\nhe was willing to die, and would let any man cut his throat, if he were\r\nobliged to live amidst constant precautions against his friends as well\r\nas his enemies. Kallippus, who perceived that the women had discovered\r\nthe whole plot, came to them in great alarm, denying that he had any\r\nshare in it, shedding tears, and offering to give any pledge of his\r\nloyalty which they chose to ask for. They demanded that he should swear\r\nthe great oath, which is as follows:--The person who is about to swear\r\nenters the precinct of the temple of Demeter and Persephone, and after\r\ncertain religious ceremonies puts on the purple robe of the goddess\r\nPersephone, and swears, holding a lighted torch in his hand. All this\r\nwas done by Kallippus, and after swearing the oath he was impious enough\r\nto wait for the festival of the goddess whose name he had taken in vain,\r\nand to commit the murder on the day which was specially dedicated to\r\nher, although, perhaps, he thought nothing about the profanation of that\r\nparticular day, but considered that it would be wickedness enough to\r\nmurder the man whom he had himself initiated into the mysteries, on\r\nwhatever day he might do it.\r\n\r\nLVII. Many were now in the plot; and when Dion was sitting with his\r\nfriends in a room furnished with several couches, some of the\r\nconspirators surrounded the house, while others stood at the doors and\r\nwindows. Those who intended to do the deed were Zakynthians, and entered\r\nthe house in their tunics, without swords. Those who remained outside\r\nmade fast the doors, while those within rushed upon Dion, and\r\nendeavoured to strangle him. As, however, they could not accomplish\r\nthis, they asked for a sword; but no one ventured to open the doors,\r\nbecause within the house were many of Dion's friends, but as each of\r\nthese imagined that, if he gave up Dion, he himself might get away safe,\r\nno one would help him. After some delay, a Syracusan, named Lykon,\r\nhanded a dagger through a window to the Zakynthians, with which, as if\r\nsacrificing a victim, they cut the throat of Dion, who had long before\r\nbeen overpowered and had given himself up for lost. His sister and his\r\nwife, who was pregnant, were at once cast into prison, where the unhappy\r\nwoman was delivered of a male child. The women prevailed upon the\r\nkeepers of the prison to spare the child's life, and obtained their\r\nrequest the more readily because Kallippus was already in difficulties.\r\n\r\nLVIII. After Kallippus had murdered Dion, he at once became a person of\r\nimportance, and had the entire government of Syracuse in his hands. He\r\neven sent despatches to Athens, a city which, next to the gods, he\r\nought, especially to have dreaded, after having brought such pollution\r\nand sacrilege upon himself. However, the saying appears to be true, that\r\nthat city produces both the best of good and the worst of wicked men,\r\njust as the territory of Athens produces both the sweetest honey and the\r\nmost poisonous hemlock. Kallippus did not long survive to mock the\r\njustice of heaven, lest the gods might have been thought to disregard a\r\nman who, by such a crime, had obtained so great wealth and power; but he\r\nsoon paid the penalty of his wickedness. He set out to capture Katana,\r\nand in doing so lost Syracuse; upon which he is said to have remarked,\r\nthat he had lost a city and gained a cheese-scraper. In an attack upon\r\nMessenia he lost most of his soldiers, among whom were the murderers of\r\nDion. As no city in Sicily would receive him, but all hated him and\r\nattacked him, he proceeded to Rhegium, where, as he was quite ruined and\r\ncould no longer maintain his mercenary soldiers, he was murdered by\r\nLeptines and Polyperchon, who chanced to use the self-same dagger with\r\nwhich Dion is said to have been slain. It was recognised by being very\r\nshort, after the Laconian fashion, and by its workmanship, for it was\r\nadmirably carved with figures in high relief. Such was the retribution\r\nwhich befel Kallippus; while Aristomache and Arete, when they were\r\nreleased from prison, fell into the power of Hiketes, a Syracusan, who\r\nhad been one of Dion's friends, and who treated them at first loyally\r\nand honourably, but afterwards, at the instigation of some of the\r\nenemies of Dion, sent them on board of a ship, on the pretext of sending\r\nthem to Peloponnesus, and gave orders to the people of the ship to put\r\nthem to death and throw their bodies into the sea. They, however, are\r\nsaid to have thrown them alive into the sea, and the child with them.\r\nThis man also paid a fitting penalty for his crimes, for he was taken\r\nand put to death by Timoleon, and the Syracusans put to death his two\r\ndaughters to avenge the murder of Dion. All of this I have already\r\ndescribed at length in the Life of Timoleon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF BRUTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The ancestor of Marcus Brutus was Junius Brutus,[496] whose statue of\r\nbronze the Romans of old set up in the Capitol, in the midst of the\r\nkings, with a drawn sword in his hand, thereby signifying that it was he\r\nwho completely accomplished the putting down of the Tarquinii. Now that\r\nBrutus, like swords forged of cold iron, having a temper naturally hard\r\nand not softened by education, was carried on even to slaying of his\r\nsons through his passion against the tyrants: but this Brutus, about\r\nwhom I am now writing, having tempered his natural disposition with\r\ndiscipline and philosophical training and roused his earnest and mild\r\ncharacter by impulse to action, is considered to have been most aptly\r\nfashioned to virtue, so that even those who were his enemies on account\r\nof the conspiracy against Cæsar, attributed to Brutus whatever of good\r\nthe act brought with it, and the worst of what happened they imputed to\r\nCassius, who was a kinsman and friend of Brutus, but in his disposition\r\nnot so simple and pure. His mother Servilia[497] traced her descent from\r\nAla Servilius,[498] who when Mallius Spurius was contriving to\r\nestablish a tyranny and was stirring up the people, put a dagger under\r\nhis arm, and going into the Forum and taking his stand close to the man,\r\nas if he were going to have something to do with him and to address him,\r\nstruck him as he bent forwards and killed him. Now this is agreed on;\r\nbut those who showed hatred and enmity towards Brutus on account of\r\nCæsar's death, say that on the father's side he was not descended from\r\nthe expeller of the Tarquinii, for that Brutus after putting his sons to\r\ndeath left no descendants, but this Brutus was a plebeian, the son of\r\none Brutus who was a bailiff,[499] and had only recently attained to a\r\nmagistracy. Poseidonius the philosopher says that the sons of Brutus,\r\nwho had arrived at man's estate, were put to death as the story is told,\r\nbut there was left a third, an infant, from whom the race of Brutus\r\ndescended; and that some of the illustrious men of his time who belonged\r\nto the family showed a personal resemblance to the statue of Brutus. So\r\nmuch about this.\r\n\r\nII. Servilia the mother of Brutus was a sister of Cato the philosopher,\r\nwhom most of all the Romans this Brutus took for his model, Cato being\r\nhis uncle and afterwards his father-in-law. As to the Greek\r\nphilosophers, there was not one, so to say, whom he did not hear or to\r\nwhom he was averse, but he devoted himself especially to those of\r\nPlato's school. The Academy[500] called the New and the Middle he was\r\nnot much disposed to, and he attached himself to the Old, and continued\r\nto be an admirer of Antiochus[501] of Ascalon; but for his friend and\r\ncompanion he chose Antiochus's brother Aristus, a man who in his manner\r\nof discourse was inferior to many philosophers, but in well-regulated\r\nhabits and mildness a rival to the first. Empylus,[502] whom both Brutus\r\nin his letters and his friends often mentioned as being in intimacy\r\nwith him, was a rhetorician and left a small work, though not a mean\r\none, on the assassination of Cæsar, which is inscribed Brutus. In the\r\nLatin language Brutus was sufficiently trained for oratory[503] and the\r\ncontests of the forum; but in the Greek, he practised the apophthegmatic\r\nand Laconic brevity which is sometimes conspicuous in his letters. For\r\ninstance when he was now engaged in the war, he wrote to the people of\r\nPergamum: \"I hear that you have given money to Dolabella; if you gave it\r\nwillingly, you admit your wrong; if you gave it unwillingly, make proof\r\nof this by giving to me willingly!\" On another occasion, to the Samians:\r\n\"Your counsels are trifling; your help is slow. What end do you expect\r\nof this?\" And another about the people of Patara: \"The Xanthians by\r\nrejecting my favours have made their country the tomb of their\r\ndesperation. The people of Patara by trusting to me want nothing of\r\nliberty in the management of their affairs. It is therefore in your\r\npower also to choose the decision of the people of Patara or the fortune\r\nof the Xanthians.\" Such is the character of the most remarkable of his\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIII. While he was still a youth he went abroad with his uncle Cato, who\r\nwas sent to Cyprus[504] to Ptolemæus. After Ptolemæus had put an end to\r\nhimself, Cato, being detained of necessity in Rhodes, happened to have\r\nsent Canidius, one of his friends, to look after the money, but as he\r\nfeared that Canidius would not keep his hands from filching, he wrote to\r\nBrutus to sail as quick as he could to Cyprus from Pamphylia; for Brutus\r\nwas staying there to recover from an illness. Brutus sailed very much\r\nagainst his will, both out of respect for Canidius, as being\r\nundeservedly deprived of his functions by Cato, and inasmuch as he was a\r\nyoung man and a student,[505] considering such a piece of business and\r\nadministration not at all fit for a free man or for himself. However, he\r\nexerted himself about these matters and was commended by Cato; and when\r\nthe king's substance was converted into money, he took the greatest part\r\nand sailed to Rome.\r\n\r\nIV. But when matters came to a division, Pompeius and Cæsar having taken\r\nup arms, and the government being in confusion, it was expected that he\r\nwould choose Cæsar's side, for his father[506] was put to death by\r\nPompeius some time before; but as he thought it right to prefer the\r\npublic interests to his own, and as he considered the ground of Pompeius\r\nfor the war to be better than Cæsar's, he joined Pompeius. And yet,\r\nhitherto, when he met Pompeius, he would not even speak to him, thinking\r\nit a great crime to talk with his father's murderer; but now, placing\r\nhimself under Pompeius as leader of his country, he sailed to Sicily as\r\nlegatus with Sestius,[507] who had got it for his province. But as there\r\nwas nothing of importance to do there, and Pompeius and Cæsar had\r\nalready met together to contend for the supremacy, he went to Macedonia\r\nas a volunteer to share the danger; on which occasion they say that\r\nPompeius, being delighted and surprised at his coming, rose from his\r\nseat and embraced him as a superior man in the presence of all. During\r\nthe campaign all the daytime when he was not with Pompeius he was\r\nemployed about study and books; and not only at other times, but also\r\nbefore the great battle. It was the height of summer, and the heat was\r\nexcessive, as they were encamped close to marshy ground; and those who\r\ncarried the tent of Brutus did not come quickly. After being much\r\nharassed about these matters, and having scarcely by midday anointed\r\nhimself and taken a little to eat, while the rest were either sleeping\r\nor engaged in thought and care about the future, he kept on writing till\r\nevening-time, making an epitome of Polybius.[508]\r\n\r\nV. It is said that Cæsar, too, was not indifferent about the man, but\r\ngave orders to those who commanded under him not to kill Brutus in the\r\nbattle, but to spare him; find if he yielded to bring him, and if he\r\nresisted being taken, to let him alone and not force him; and this, it\r\nis said, he did to please Servilia,[509] the mother of Brutus. For when\r\nhe was still a youth, he had, it seems, known Servilia, who was\r\npassionately in love with him, and as Brutus was born about the time\r\nwhen her love was most ardent, he had in some degree a persuasion that\r\nBrutus was his son. It is recorded that when the great affair of\r\nCatilina had engaged the Senate, which affair came very near overturning\r\nthe State, Cato and Cæsar were standing up at the same time and\r\ndisputing. While this was going on, a small letter was brought in and\r\ngiven to Cæsar, which he read silently, whereon Cato called out that\r\nCæsar was doing a shameful thing in receiving communications and letters\r\nfrom their enemies. Many of the Senators hereon made a tumult, and Cæsar\r\ngave the letter just as it was to Cato, and it was a passionate letter\r\nfrom his sister Servilia, which he read and throwing it to Cæsar said,\r\n\"Take it, drunkard;\" and he again turned afresh to his argument and his\r\nspeech. So notorious was the love of Servilia for Cæsar.\r\n\r\nVI. After the defeat at Pharsalus and the escape of Pompeius to the sea,\r\nwhile the ramparts were blockaded, Brutus secretly got out of the gates\r\nwhich led to a marshy spot, full of water and reeds, and made his way by\r\nnight to Larissa. From thence he wrote to Cæsar, who was pleased that he\r\nwas alive and told him to come to him; and he not only pardoned Brutus,\r\nbut had him about him and treated him with as much respect as any one\r\nelse. No one could say where Pompeius had fled to, and there was much\r\ndoubt about it; but Cæsar walking a short way alone with Brutus tried to\r\nfind out his opinion on the matter; and as Brutus appeared, from certain\r\nconsiderations, to have come to the best conjecture about the flight of\r\nPompeius, Cæsar leaving everything else hurried to Egypt. But Pompeius,\r\nwho, as Brutus conjectured, had landed in Egypt, met his fate there; and\r\nBrutus mollified Cæsar even towards Cassius.[510] When Brutus was\r\nspeaking in defence of the King of the Libyans,[511] he felt himself\r\noverpowered by the magnitude of the charges against him, but yet by his\r\nprayers and urgent entreaties he preserved for him a large part of his\r\ndommions. Cæsar is said, when he first heard Brutus speaking, to have\r\nremarked to his friends: \"This youth, I know not what he wills, but what\r\nhe does will, he wills with energy.\" For the earnest character of\r\nBrutus, and his disposition not to listen unadvisedly nor to every one\r\nwho asked a favour, but to act upon reflection and principle, made his\r\nefforts strong and effective towards accomplishing whatever he turned\r\nto. But towards unreasonable prayers he was immovable by flattery, and\r\nto be overcome by those who impudently urged their suit, which some call\r\nto be shamed out of a thing, he considered to be most disgraceful to a\r\ngreat man, and he was wont to say that those who can refuse nothing,\r\nwere in his opinion persons who had not well husbanded their youthful\r\nbloom. When Cæsar was going to cross over to Libya against Cato and\r\nScipio, he intrusted Brutus with Gallia[512] on this side of the Alps,\r\nto the great good fortune of the province; for while the other\r\nprovinces, through the violence and rapacity of those who were intrusted\r\nwith them, were harassed like conquered countries, Brutus was to the\r\nGauls a relief and consolation for their former misfortunes; and he put\r\nall to Cæsar's credit, so that when after his return Cæsar was going\r\nabout Italy, the cities that had been under Brutus were a most pleasing\r\nsight, as well as Brutus himself, who was increasing his honour and\r\nassociating with him as a friend.\r\n\r\nVII. Now there were several prætorships, but that which conferred the\r\nchief dignity, and is called the Urban prætorship,[513] it was expected\r\nthat either Brutus or Cassius would have; and some say that Brutus and\r\nCassius, who had before some slight causes of dispute, were still more\r\nat variance about this office, though they were kinsmen, for Cassius was\r\nthe husband of Junia, the sister of Brutus. Others say that this rivalry\r\nwas the work of Cæsar, who continued secretly to give both of them\r\nhopes, until, being thus urged on and irritated, they were brought into\r\ncollision. Brutus relied on his good fame and virtues against the many\r\nsplendid exploits of Cassius in his Parthian campaigns. Cæsar hearing\r\nthis and consulting with his friends said: \"What Cassius says has more\r\njustice, but Brutus must have the first office.\" Cassius was appointed\r\nto another prætorship, but he had not so much gratitude for what he got,\r\nas anger for what he failed in getting. Brutus also shared Cæsar's power\r\nin other respects as much as he chose. For if he had chosen, he might\r\nhave been the first of his friends and had most power; but his intimacy\r\nwith Cassius drew him that way and turned him from Cæsar, though he had\r\nnot yet been reconciled to Cassius after their former rivalry; but he\r\nlistened to his friends who urged him not to let himself be softened and\r\nsoothed by Cæsar, and to fly from the friendly advances and the favours\r\nwhich a tyrant showed him, not because he respected the virtues of\r\nBrutus, but because he wished to curtail his vigour and to undermine his\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nVIII. Nor yet was Cæsar altogether without suspicions of Brutus, and\r\nmatter of complaint against him; he feared the proud temper and the\r\ncredit and friends of the man, but he trusted in his moral character. In\r\nthe first place, when Antonius and Dolabella[514] were said to be aiming\r\nat change, he said, it was not sleek and long-haired men who gave him\r\ntrouble, but those pale and lean fellows, meaning Brutus and Cassius.\r\nNext, when some persons were making insinuations against the fidelity of\r\nBrutus and urging Cæsar to be on his guard, he touched his body with his\r\nhand and said, \"What, think you that Brutus would not wait for this poor\r\nbody?\" thereby intimating that no person but Brutus had any pretensions\r\nto so much power after himself. And indeed it seems that Brutus might\r\ncertainly have been the first man in the State, if he could have endured\r\nfor a short time to be second to Cæsar, and if he had let Cæsar's power\r\npass its acme, and the fame got by his great exploits waste away. But\r\nCassius, who was a violent-tempered man and rather on his individual\r\naccount a hater of Cæsar than on the public account a hater of the\r\ntyrant, inflamed Brutus and urged him on. Brutus indeed is said to have\r\nbeen discontented with the dominion, but Cassius to have hated the\r\ndominator; and Cassius had various grievances against Cæsar and among\r\nothers, the seizing of the lions, which Cassius had procured when he was\r\ngoing to be ædile, but Cæsar kept them after they had been found in\r\nMegara at the time when the city was taken by Calenus.[515] It is said\r\nthat these beasts were the cause of great calamity to the people of\r\nMegara: for when the enemy were getting possession of the city, the\r\ncitizens forced open their dens and loosed their chains, that the beasts\r\nmight oppose the enemy who were entering the city, but they rushed\r\nagainst the citizens themselves, and running among them rent those who\r\nwere unarmed, so that the sight moved even the enemy to pity.\r\n\r\nIX. Now they say that this was with Cassius the main cause of his\r\nconspiring; but they say so untruly. For there was from the beginning in\r\nthe nature of Cassius a certain hostility and dislike to all the race of\r\ntyrants, as he showed when he was still a boy and went to the same\r\nschool with Faustus,[516] the son of Sulla. Faustus was one day bragging\r\namong the boys and exalting the monarchy of his father, on which Cassius\r\ngot up and thumped him. The guardians of Faustus and his kinsmen were\r\ndesirous to prosecute the matter and seek legal satisfaction; but\r\nPompeius prevented this, and bringing both the boys together questioned\r\nthem about the affair. Thereon it is reported that Cassius said, \"Come,\r\nnow, Faustus, say if you dare before Pompeius the words at which I was\r\nenraged, that I may break your mouth again.\" Such was the character of\r\nCassius. But many words from his friends and many oral and written\r\nexpressions from the citizens called and urged Brutus to the deed. For\r\nthey wrote on the statue of his ancestor Brutus, who had put down the\r\ndominion of the kings: \"Would you were here, Brutus!\" and \"Would Brutus\r\nwere now living!\" And the tribunal of Brutus, who was prætor, was found\r\nevery morning full of such writings as these: \"Brutus, are you asleep?\"\r\nand \"You are not really Brutus!\" But they who were the real cause of\r\nthis were the flatterers of Cæsar, who devised various unpopular\r\ndistinctions for him and placed diadems on his statues by night, as if\r\ntheir design was to lead on the many to salute him as king instead of\r\ndictator. But the contrary was the result, as it has been\r\ncircumstantially told in the Life of Cæsar.[517]\r\n\r\nX. When Cassius was trying to move his friends against Cæsar, they all\r\nassented, provided Brutus would take the lead; for they said that the\r\nundertaking required not hands nor yet daring, but the character of a\r\nman such as Brutus was, who should as it were begin the holy rite and\r\nconfirm it by his presence: if this could not be, the conspirators would\r\nbe more dispirited in the doing of the deed and more timid when they had\r\ndone it, for it would be said that Brutus would not have rejected all\r\nshare in the thing, if it had a good cause. Cassius, who saw the truth\r\nof this, now made the first advances to Brutus since their difference.\r\nAnd after their reconciliation and friendly greeting Cassius asked, if\r\nhe intended to be present in the Senate on the new-moon of March, for he\r\nheard that Cæsar's friends would then make a proposal about the kingly\r\npower. Brutus replied that he would not be present. \"What then,\" said\r\nCassius, \"if they summon us?\" \"It would be my business then,\" said\r\nBrutus, \"not to be silent, but to fight and die in defence of liberty.\"\r\nCassius being now encouraged said, \"What Roman will endure that you die\r\nfirst? Brutus, do you not know yourself? Do you think it is the weavers\r\nand tavern-keepers who have written on your tribunal, and not the first\r\nand best who have done this, and who demand from the other prætors\r\ndonations and shows and gladiators, but from you, as a debt that you owe\r\nyour country, the destruction of the tyranny, and who are ready to\r\nsuffer everything for you, if you show yourself to be such a man as they\r\nthink you ought to be and they expect you to be.\" Upon this he threw his\r\narms around Brutus and embraced him, and thus separating each went to\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nXI. There was one Caius Ligarius,[518] a friend of Pompeius, who had\r\nbeen accused on this ground and acquitted by Cæsar. This man, who had\r\nnot gratitude for his acquittal of the charge, but was hostile to the\r\npower by reason of which he had been in danger, was an enemy of Cæsar,\r\nand one of the most intimate friends of Brutus. Brutus, who came to see\r\nhim when he was sick, said, \"Ligarius, at what a time you are sick!\"\r\nImmediately supporting himself on his elbow, and laying hold of the hand\r\nof Brutus, Ligarius said, \"But if you, Brutus, design anything worthy of\r\nyourself, I am well.\"\r\n\r\nXII. After this they secretly sounded their acquaintance whom they\r\ntrusted, and communicated the design to them, and added them to their\r\nnumber; making choice not only among their intimates, but those whom\r\nthey knew to be good darers and to despise death. It was for this reason\r\nthat they concealed their design from Cicero, though both as to\r\ntrustworthiness and goodwill he was esteemed by them among the first,\r\nlest to his natural defect of courage he should join by reason of his\r\nyears senile caution, and so attempting by deliberation to bring\r\neverything singly to perfect security, should blunt their edge, which\r\nrequired the speed of ready action. Among his other companions Brutus\r\nomitted also Statilius[519] the Epicurean, and Favonius, an admirer of\r\nCato, because when Brutus, in conversation and philosophical\r\ndisquisition, had remotely and in a circuitous way sounded them about\r\nsuch an attempt, Favonius answered that a civil war was worse than an\r\nillegal monarchy; and Statilius said that it was not befitting a wise\r\nman, and one who had understanding, to expose himself to danger and to\r\ntrouble on account of the vile and foolish. Labeo,[520] who was present,\r\nopposed both of them. Brutus, indeed, at the time kept silent, as if he\r\nconsidered that the matter was something hard and difficult to\r\ndetermine; but afterwards he communicated his design to Labeo. When\r\nLabeo had readily accepted the proposal, it was resolved to gain over\r\nthe other Brutus, surnamed Albinus,[521] who was not a man of action,\r\nnor courageous, but he was strengthened by a number of gladiators, whom\r\nhe was keeping for a spectacle for the Romans, and he was also in the\r\nconfidence of Cæsar. When Cassius and Labeo spoke to him he made no\r\nanswer, but meeting privately with Brutus, and learning that he was the\r\nleader in the act, he agreed to co-operate zealously. The greater part,\r\nand the men of chief note among the rest of the conspirators, were also\r\nbrought over by the reputation of Brutus. And without swearing any\r\nmutual oath, or taking or giving mutual pledges by sacrifice of victims,\r\nthey all so kept the secret in themselves and were silent and carried it\r\nwith them, that the act, though prognosticated by the gods through\r\noracular answers and sights and victims, was considered past belief.\r\n\r\nXIII. Brutus having now the first men in Rome, both for spirit and\r\nfamily and virtues, dependent upon himself, and having a view of the\r\nwhole danger, in his public demeanour endeavoured to restrain within\r\nhimself and to keep his designs under strict control; but at home and by\r\nnight he was no longer the same man, for sometimes care roused him\r\ninvoluntarily from his sleep, and at other times he was sunk in thought\r\nand brooding over the difficulties; and it did not escape his wife, who\r\nwas resting with him, that he was full of unusual trouble, and was\r\nrevolving in himself some design hard to carry and difficult to unravel.\r\nNow Porcia,[522] as it has been said, was the daughter of Cato, and\r\nBrutus, who was her cousin, had married her, not in her virgin state,\r\nbut he took her after the death of her husband, while she was still a\r\nyoung woman, and had one little child by her husband, and the child's\r\nname was Bibulus; and there is extant a small book of memoirs of Brutus,\r\nwritten by Bibulus. Porcia, who was a philosopher and loved her\r\nhusband, and was full of spirit and good sense, did not attempt to\r\nquestion her husband about his secrets before she had made trial of\r\nherself in manner following. She took a knife, such as barbers pare the\r\nnails with, and putting all her attendants out of the chamber, she\r\ninflicted a deep wound in her thigh, so that there was a large flow of\r\nblood, and, shortly after, violent pains and shivering fever came upon\r\nher in consequence of the wound. Brutus being agonised and full of\r\ntrouble, Porcia spoke to him thus in the acme of her pain: \"I, Brutus,\r\nCato's daughter, was given unto thy house, not like women, who serve as\r\nconcubines, to share thy bed and board only, but to be a partner in thy\r\nhappiness, and a partner in thy sorrows. Now, with respect to thy\r\nmarriage, everything is blameless on thy part; but as to me, what\r\nevidence is there, or what affection, if I must neither share with thee\r\na secret sorrow nor a care which demands confidence? I know that a\r\nwoman's nature is considered too weak to carry a secret, but, Brutus,\r\nthere is a certain power towards making moral character in a good\r\nnurture and honest conversation; and I am Cato's daughter and also\r\nBrutus' wife, whereon hitherto I had less relied, but now I know that I\r\nam also invincible to pain.\" Thus saying, she showed him the wound, and\r\ntold him of the trial she had made of herself. Struck with astonishment\r\nand stretching forth his hands, Brutus prayed that the gods would permit\r\nhim to succeed in the enterprise and to show himself a husband worthy of\r\nPorcia. He then consoled his wife.\r\n\r\nXIV. When notice had been given of a meeting of the Senate, at which\r\nCæsar was expected to be present, they resolved to make the attempt, for\r\nthey would be then collected without raising any suspicion, and they\r\nwould have together all the men of highest character and rank, who would\r\nbe ready as soon as a great act was accomplished, forthwith to seize\r\ntheir freedom. The circumstance of the place, too, was considered to be\r\na token from heaven and in their favour. For it was a portico, one\r\nbelonging to the theatre,[523] with an exhedra, in which there was a\r\nstatue of Pompeius, which the city erected at the time when Pompeius\r\nadorned that site with porticoes and the theatre. Hither then the Senate\r\nwas summoned about the middle of the month of March; the Romans call the\r\nday the Ides; so that some dæmon seemed to be bringing the man to the\r\nvengeance of Pompeius. When the day came, Brutus put a dagger under his\r\nvest, without any one being privy to it except his wife, and went forth;\r\nthe rest assembled at the house of Cassius, to conduct down to the Forum\r\nCassius' son, who was going to assume the toga called virilis. From\r\nthence they all hurried to the portico of Pompeius, where they waited in\r\nexpectation of Cæsar's coming immediately to the Senate. Herein most of\r\nall would one have admired the impassiveness of the men and their\r\npresence of mind before the danger, if he had known what was going to\r\ntake place--in that, being compelled by their duties of prætor to attend\r\nto the concerns of many persons, they not only listened patiently to\r\nthose who came before them and had matter in dispute, like men who have\r\nplenty of leisure, but they also gave to each their decision in exact\r\nform and with judgment, carefully attending to the business. And when\r\none person, who was unwilling to submit to the decision, was appealing\r\nto Cæsar, and calling out loud and protesting, Brutus, looking on the\r\nbystanders, said: \"Cæsar does not hinder me from acting according to the\r\nlaws, and he will not hinder me.\"\r\n\r\nXV. And yet many things chanced to fall out to cause them perplexity;\r\nfirst and chief, that Cæsar tarried while the day was getting on, and as\r\nthe victims were not propitious, was kept at home by his wife, and was\r\nhindered by the priests from going abroad. In the next place, a person\r\ncame up to Casca, who was one of the conspirators, and taking his hand\r\nsaid, \"Casca, you have concealed the secret from us, but Brutus has\r\ndisclosed all to me.\" Casca was startled at this, whereon the other\r\nsmiled and said, \"How have you grown so rich all at once as to become a\r\ncandidate for the ædileship?\" So near did Casca come to betraying the\r\nsecret, being deceived by the ambiguity of the man's words. A senator\r\nalso, Popilius Lænas,[524] saluted Brutus and Cassius in a more lively\r\nway than usual, and whispering in a low tone, \"You have my wishes,\" he\r\nsaid, \"for success in what you design, and I urge you not to tarry, for\r\nthe matter is no secret.\" Saying this he withdrew, putting them in great\r\nsuspicion of the intended deed being known. In the meantime one came\r\nrunning from the house of Brutus and told him that his wife was dying.\r\nFor Porcia, who was beside herself through thinking of what was going to\r\nbe done, and unable to bear the weight of her anxiety, could scarce keep\r\nherself within doors, and at every noise and shout, like those possessed\r\nwith bacchic frenzy, she would spring forth and question every one who\r\ncame in from the Forum, what Brutus was doing, and was continually\r\nsending others out. At length, as the time began to be protracted, her\r\nbodily strength no longer held out, but she fainted and swooned away,\r\nher mind wandering by reason of her perplexity; and she could not reach\r\nher apartment before faintness and indescribable alarm seized her, where\r\nshe was sitting in the midst of her attendants, and her colour changed\r\nand her voice was completely choked. Her maids at this sight shrieked\r\naloud, and as the neighbours quickly ran to the door, a report went\r\nforth and was given out abroad, that she was dead. However she quickly\r\nrecovered and was herself again, and her women took care of her. Brutus\r\nwas troubled, as was natural, by this report coming upon him; yet he did\r\nnot desert the public interest, nor allow himself to be carried away by\r\nhis feelings to his own domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nXVI. And now it was told that Cæsar was approaching, borne in a litter.\r\nFor he had determined, in consequence of being dispirited by the\r\nsacrifices, to ratify nothing of importance at that time, but to put\r\nthings off on the pretext of illness. When he had stepped out of the\r\nlitter, Popilius Lænas hurried up to him, he who had a little before\r\nwished Brutus good luck and success, and he talked some time with Cæsar\r\nwho was standing there and listening. The conspirators (for so we may\r\ncall them) not hearing what he said, but conjecturing from their own\r\nsuspicions that the conversation was a discovery of the plot, sunk in\r\ntheir spirits and looked at one another, by their countenances declaring\r\nto one another that they ought not to wait to be seized, but forthwith\r\nto die by their own hands. Cassius and some others had already laid\r\ntheir hands on the hilts of their daggers under their garments and were\r\ndrawing them out, when Brutus observing in the attitude of Lænas the\r\nearnestness of a man who was asking a favour and not preferring an\r\naccusation, said nothing, because so many persons not of their party\r\nwere mingled with them, but he encouraged Cassius by the cheering\r\nexpression of his countenance. And soon after Lænas kissed Cæsar's right\r\nhand and withdrew, by which it was plain that he had spoken with Cæsar\r\nabout himself and some of his own concerns.\r\n\r\nXVII.[525] The Senate having advanced to the exhedra, the conspirators\r\nsurrounded Cæsar's chair, as if they designed to have a conference with\r\nhim. And it is said that Cassius, turning his face to the statue of\r\nPompeius, invoked him as if he could hear; and Trebonius having engaged\r\nAntonius in conversation at the door kept him out. As Cæsar entered, the\r\nSenate stood up, and as soon as he sat down, the conspirators in a body\r\nsurrounded him, putting forward Tillius Cimber, one of their number, to\r\nsupplicate for his brother who was an exile; and they all joined in the\r\nsupplication, laying hold of Cæsar's hands, and they kissed his breast\r\nand head. Cæsar at first repulsed their intreaties, and then, as they\r\ndid not intermit, he made a sudden attempt to rise up, on which Tillius,\r\nwith both his hands, pulled Cæsar's garment down from the shoulders, and\r\nCasca first of all (for he stood behind him) drew his sword and drove it\r\ninto Cæsar's body near the shoulders, but to no great depth. Cæsar,\r\nlaying hold of the handle, cried out aloud in the Roman language,\r\n\"Villain Casca, what are you doing!\" and Casca, addressing his brother\r\nin Greek, urged him to come to his aid. Cæsar being now assaulted by\r\nmany, looked around with the intention of forcing his way through them,\r\nbut when he saw Brutus drawing his sword against him, he let loose his\r\nhold of Casca's hand, and wrapping his head in his garment he offered\r\nhis body to the blows. The conspirators, who were all mingled in\r\nconfusion, and using their numerous swords against Cæsar, wounded one\r\nanother, so that even Brutus received a blow on the hand while he was\r\ntaking part in the slaughter; and they were all drenched with blood.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Cæsar having been thus killed, Brutus advanced into the midst\r\nwishing to speak, and he attempted to detain the Senate by encouraging\r\nthem; but the senators, through fear, fled in disorder, and there was\r\nshoving and confusion about the door, though no one pursued or pressed\r\nupon them. For it had been firmly resolved to kill no other than Cæsar,\r\nbut to invite all to freedom. Now the rest, when they were deliberating\r\nabout the deed, were of opinion that they should kill Antonius at the\r\nsame time with Cæsar, as he was a man who aspired to monarchical power\r\nand was a violent man, and had got strength by his intercourse and\r\nfamiliarity with the army; and chiefly that to his natural haughtiness\r\nand daring temper he had added the dignity of the consulship, being then\r\nCæsar's colleague. But Brutus opposed the design, first relying on\r\ngrounds of justice, and next suggesting hopes of a change. For he did\r\nnot despair that Antonius, a man of generous nature, a lover of\r\nhonourable distinctions and fond of fame, when Cæsar was put out of the\r\nway, would join his country in seizing hold of freedom, and be led on by\r\nthem through emulation to what was good. In this way Brutus saved\r\nAntonius; but in the then alarm Antonius changed his dress for plebeian\r\nattire and fled. Brutus and his partisans went to the Capitol, their\r\nhands stained with blood, and displaying their bare swords called the\r\ncitizens to liberty. Now, at first, there were shouts, and the people\r\nrunning this way and that, as chance would have it, after the murder,\r\nincreased the confusion; but as there was no more slaughter and no\r\nplundering of the things exposed for sale, both the senators and many of\r\nthe plebeians took heart and went up to the conspirators to the Capitol.\r\nThe multitude being assembled, Brutus spoke in a way to please the\r\npeople and suitable to the circumstances; and as the people commended\r\nhim and called out for them to come down, the conspirators confidently\r\ndescended to the Forum, the rest following with one another; but many\r\nof the persons of distinction putting Brutus in the midst of them,\r\nconducted him with great show from the Capitol, and placed him on the\r\nRostra. At the sight of this the many, though a mingled body and\r\nprepared to raise a tumult, were afraid, and they awaited the result in\r\norder and silence. When Brutus came forward they all listened to what he\r\nsaid; but that the deed was not agreeable to all, they made evident when\r\nCinna began to speak and to bring charges against Cæsar, by breaking out\r\nin passion and abusing Cinna, so that the conspirators returned to the\r\nCapitol. Brutus, fearing to be blockaded, then sent away the chief\r\npersons of those who had gone up with him, not thinking it right that,\r\nas they had no share in the blame, they should sustain a share in the\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nXIX. However, on the following day when the Senate met in the temple of\r\nEarth, and Antonius and Plancus[526] and Cicero had spoken about an\r\namnesty and concord, it was resolved that the conspirators should not\r\nonly have impunity, but that the consuls should also propose a measure\r\nfor conferring honours on them. They voted these things, and then\r\nseparated. After Antonius had sent his son to the Capitol as a hostage,\r\nBrutus and the conspirators came down, and there were salutations and\r\npressing of hands among all of them together. Antonius received Cassius\r\nand feasted him, and Lepidus entertained Brutus; and the rest were\r\nentertained by others according to the intimacy or friendship that\r\nexisted between them. At daybreak the senators met again, and in the\r\nfirst place they conferred honours on Antonius for having stopped the\r\nbeginning of civil wars; in the second place, thanks were given to\r\nBrutus and his friends who were present, and finally distributions of\r\nprovinces. For to Brutus they decreed Crete, and to Cassius Libya, and\r\nto Trebonius Asia, and to Cimber Bithynia, and to the other Brutus\r\nGallia on the Eridanus.\r\n\r\nXX. After this a discussion arising about the will of Cæsar and his\r\ninterment, and Antonius demanding that the will should be read, and that\r\nthe body should be carried forth not secretly nor without due honours,\r\nso that this, too, might not irritate the people, Cassius violently\r\nopposed it, but Brutus gave way, wherein he was considered to have made\r\na second mistake. For in sparing Antonius he incurred the imputation of\r\nstrengthening against the conspirators a dangerous and irresistible\r\nenemy; and as to the matter of the interment, in allowing it to take\r\nplace in the way in which Antonius demanded, he was considered to have\r\naltogether made a mistake. For in the first place there being given by\r\nthe will to every Roman seventy-five drachmæ,[527] and to the people\r\nthere being left the gardens beyond the river, where the temple of\r\nFortuna now is, a wonderful degree of affection and regret for Cæsar\r\nseized the citizens: in the second place, when the body had been carried\r\ninto the Forum, and Antonius according to custom had pronounced a\r\nfuneral oration in honour of Cæsar, seeing that the masses were stirred\r\nby his speech, he changed their feeling into compassion, and taking the\r\nblood-stained vest of Cæsar he unfolded it and showed the rents and the\r\nnumber of the wounds. Upon this there was no longer any order kept; but\r\nsome called out to kill the murderers, and others, as before in the case\r\nof Clodius[528] the demagogue, tearing up the benches and tables from\r\nthe workshops and bringing them together made a very large pile; and\r\nplacing the corpse upon it in the midst of many temples and asyla and\r\nholy places burnt it. When the fire blazed forth, men from various\r\nquarters, approaching and plucking out half-burnt pieces of wood, ran\r\nabout to the houses of Cæsar's assassins, intending to fire them. But\r\nthey were already well prepared and repelled the danger. Now there was\r\none Cinna,[529] a man given to poetry, who was under no imputation in\r\nthe matter, and had even been a friend of Cæsar. He dreamed in a dream\r\nthat he was invited by Cæsar to supper and he refused; but Cæsar urged\r\nand forced him, and at last, laying hold of his hand, led him to a vast\r\nand gloomy place, he following the while unwilling and alarmed. After\r\nhaving this vision, it happened that he had a fever in the night.\r\nNevertheless, in the morning, when Cæsar's body was being carried forth\r\nhe felt ashamed not to be present, and went out to the rabble, who were\r\nnow in a ferocious mood. Being seen and supposed to be not the Cinna\r\nthat he was, but the Cinna who had lately reviled Cæsar before the\r\nassembly, he was torn in pieces.\r\n\r\nXXI. It was mainly through fear on account of this unlucky affair, next\r\nafter the change in Antonius, that Brutus and his partisans left the\r\ncity. They stayed in Antium[530] at first, with the design of returning\r\nto Rome when the popular fury should have passed its height and worn\r\nitself out. And this they expected to take place as a matter of course\r\namong numbers which were subject to unsteady and rapid movements, and\r\nbecause they had the Senate in their favour, who without taking any\r\nnotice of those that had torn Cinna to pieces, sought out and seized\r\nthose who had attacked the houses of the conspirators. The people, too,\r\nalready annoyed at Antonius being nearly established in monarchical\r\npower, longed for Brutus, and it was expected that he would, in person,\r\nsuperintend the spectacles[531] which as prætor it was his duty to\r\nexhibit. But when Brutus heard that many of those who had served under\r\nCæsar and received lands and cities from him, were forming designs\r\nagainst him, and were dropping into the city a few at a time, he did not\r\nventure to go, and the people saw the spectacles, which, though Brutus\r\nwas absent, were furnished without any thrift and in a profuse style.\r\nFor he had purchased a great number of wild beasts, and he gave orders\r\nthat none should be sold or left, but that all should be killed; and he\r\nhimself went down to Neapolis and engaged most of the actors. With\r\nrespect to a certain Canutius who was much in favour on the theatre, he\r\nwrote to his friends that they should get him on the stage by\r\npersuasion, for it was not fit that any Greek should be forced. He also\r\nwrote to Cicero and urged him by all means to be present at the\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\nXXII. While affairs were in this state, another change was brought about\r\nby the arrival of the young Cæsar.[532] He was the son of Cæsar's niece,\r\nbut by Cæsar's testament he was left his son and heir: and he was\r\nstaying at Apollonia when Cæsar was killed, being engaged with\r\nphilosophical studies and waiting for Cæsar, who had resolved to march\r\nforthwith against the Parthians. As soon as he heard of Cæsar's death he\r\ncame to Rome, and by assuming Cæsar's name as a mode of beginning to get\r\nthe popular favour, and by paying among the citizens the money that was\r\nleft them, he made a strong party against Antonius, and by distributing\r\nmoney he got together and assembled many of those who had served under\r\nCæsar. Now when Cicero took the side of Cæsar through hatred of\r\nAntonius, Brutus[533] rebuked him strongly in his letters, saying that\r\nCicero did not dislike a master, but feared a master who hated him, and\r\nthat his policy was to choose a mild servitude, as he showed by writing\r\nand saying, \"How good Cæsar is!\" But our fathers, he said, did not\r\nendure even mild masters. He said that for his part at this crisis he\r\nhad neither quite resolved to fight nor to remain quiet, but he was\r\nresolved on one thing only, not to be a slave; but he wondered at\r\nCicero, that he was afraid of a civil war and one attended with danger,\r\nand was not afraid of a base and inglorious peace, and that he asked as\r\na reward for ejecting Antonius from the tyranny, to be allowed to make\r\nCæsar a tyrant.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Now in his first letters Brutus thus expressed himself; but when\r\npeople were separating themselves, some on the side of Cæsar and some on\r\nthe side of Antonius, and the armies being venal were selling themselves\r\nas it were by auction to the highest bidder, Brutus, altogether\r\ndespairing of affairs, resolved to leave Italy, and he went by land\r\nthrough Lucania to Velia[534] to the sea. From this place Porcia,\r\nintending to turn back to Rome, endeavoured to conceal her excessive\r\nemotion, but a painting made her betray herself though she was a\r\nnoble-spirited woman. It was a subject from Grecian story, Hector\r\naccompanied by Andromache,[535] who was receiving her infant son from\r\nHector and looking upon him. The sight of the picture, in which her own\r\nfeelings were portrayed, melted Porcia to tears, and she went to it many\r\ntimes in the day and wept. Acilius, one of the friends of Brutus, having\r\npronounced the words of Andromache to Hector:--\r\n\r\n   \"Hector, thou art to me father and mother dear,\r\n    And brother too, and husband in thy bloom:\"\r\n\r\nBrutus, smiling, said, \"But it is not for me to say to Porcia as Hector\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n   \"'The loom and distaff, and command the maids;'\r\n\r\nfor owing to the natural weakness of her body she is unable to perform\r\nnoble deeds equally with us, but in her mind she nobly dares as we do in\r\ndefence of our country.\" This is recorded by Bibulus, the son of Porcia.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Having set out thence Brutus sailed towards Athens.[536] The\r\npeople received him gladly with expressions of good wishes and public\r\nhonours, and he lodged with a friend. As he attended the discourses of\r\nTheomnestus the Academic, and Cratippus[537] the Peripatetic, and\r\nassociated with those philosophers, it was supposed that he was\r\naltogether inactive and was unbending himself. But he was busied about\r\npreparations for war, when no one suspected it; for he sent Herostratus\r\ninto Macedonia with the view of gaining over those who were with the\r\narmies there, and he attached to himself and kept with him the young men\r\nfrom Rome who were residing at Athens for the sake of their studies.\r\nAmong them was also a son of Cicero whom Brutus particularly commends,\r\nand says, that whether he is waking or sleeping, he admires him for his\r\nnoble disposition and hatred of tyrants. Having now begun openly to\r\nattend to affairs, and hearing that Roman vessels full of money were\r\nsailing over from Asia, with a commander on board who was an honest man\r\nand an acquaintance of his, he met him near Carystus;[538] and having\r\nfallen in with him and persuaded him and obtained a surrender of the\r\nvessels, he prepared for a magnificent entertainment, for it was the\r\nbirthday of Brutus. When they had come to drinking and were pouring out\r\nwine with wishes for the success of Brutus and the liberty of the\r\nRomans, Brutus, wishing to encourage them still more, asked for a larger\r\ncup, and taking it up, without anything moving thereto, he uttered the\r\nfollowing verse:\r\n\r\n   \"Me evil fate and Leto's son[539] have slain.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to this they report that when he went out to fight the last\r\nbattle at Philippi, Apollo was the word that he gave to his soldiers.\r\nAccordingly they consider that the utterance of that verse was a sign of\r\nwhat was to befall him.\r\n\r\nXXV. After this Antistius gave Brutus fifty ten thousands out of the\r\nmoney which he was taking to Italy; and all the soldiers of Pompeius who\r\nwere still rambling about Thessaly gladly flocked to Brutus; and he took\r\nfive hundred horsemen from Cinna who was conducting them into Asia to\r\nDolabella.[540] He then sailed against Demetrias[541] and got possession\r\nof a large quantity of arms, which were going to be carried away to\r\nAntonius, and had been made at the command of the elder Cæsar for the\r\nParthian war. Hortensius,[542] the governor, also surrendered Macedonia\r\nto him, and the kings and rulers all around began to side with him and\r\nto come over; but in the meantime news arrived that Caius, the brother\r\nof Antonius, had crossed over from Italy and was marching straight\r\nagainst the troops which Gabinius[543] had under him in Epidamnus and\r\nApollonia. Brutus, intending to anticipate and prevent him, immediately\r\nput in motion those who were with him, and marched through a difficult\r\ncountry in the midst of a snow-storm; and he was far in advance of those\r\nwho conveyed the provisions. As he came near Epidamnus, he began to\r\nsuffer from bulimy[544] through exhaustion and cold. This malady chiefly\r\nattacks both beasts and men when they are worn out and in the midst of\r\nthe snow, whether it is that the heat owing to the refrigeration and\r\ncondensation, when everything is internally compressed, consumes the\r\nnourishment all at once, or that a sharp and subtle breath arising from\r\nthe snow penetrating through, cuts the body and destroys the warmth\r\nwhich is dispersed outwards from it. For it seems that heat causes\r\nsweats through meeting with the cold and being quenched about the\r\nsurface; whereof there has been further discussion in another place.\r\n\r\nXXVI. As Brutus was fainting, and no one in the army had anything to\r\neat, his attendants were compelled to fly for refuge to their enemies,\r\nand approaching the gates they asked bread of the watch, who hearing of\r\nthe mishap of Brutus came and brought to eat and to drink. In return for\r\nwhich, when Brutus got possession of the city, he not only treated them\r\nkindly, but also all the rest for their sake. Caius Antonius now came up\r\nto Apollonia and summoned the soldiers who were there; but when they\r\nwent over to Brutus, and he perceived that the people of Apollonia were\r\nin favour of Brutus, he left the city and marched to Buthrotum.[545] And\r\nin the first place he lost three cohorts, which were cut to pieces by\r\nBrutus on the march; and in the next place, attempting to force the\r\nposts about Byblis, which were already occupied, he came to a battle\r\nwith Cicero and was defeated; for Brutus employed Cicero in command and\r\ngained many successes through him. Brutus himself came upon Caius, who\r\nwas in marshy ground and far separated from the rest of his troops, but\r\nhe would not let his men make an attack, and he threw his cavalry around\r\nhim with orders to spare the men, saying that in a short time they would\r\nbe theirs; which in fact happened, for they surrendered themselves and\r\ntheir general, so that there was now a large force with Brutus. Now\r\nBrutus treated Caius respectfully for some time and did not deprive him\r\nof the insignia of his office, though, as they say, many persons, and\r\nCicero among the rest, wrote to him from Rome and urged him to do it.\r\nBut as Caius began to have secret conferences with the officers and\r\nattempted to excite a mutiny, he had him put in a ship and guarded. The\r\nsoldiers who had been corrupted fled to Apollonia and invited Brutus\r\nthere, but Brutus said that this was not the custom among the Romans,\r\nand that they must come to their general, and ask pardon for their\r\noffence. They came, and Brutus pardoned them at their prayer.\r\n\r\nXXVII. As Brutus was going to set out for Asia, news arrived of the\r\nchanges at Rome. The young Cæsar had been strengthened by the Senate\r\nagainst Antonius, whom he had driven out of Italy, and he was now\r\nformidable, and was seeking for the consulship contrary to law, and\r\nmaintaining large armies of which the State had no need. But when Cæsar\r\nsaw that the Senate was displeased at this, and was looking abroad\r\ntowards Brutus and decreeing provinces[546] for him and confirming them,\r\nhe became alarmed. And he sent to Antonius and invited him to\r\nfriendship, and placing his troops around the city he got the\r\nconsulship, being yet hardly a young man, but in his twentieth year, as\r\nhe said in his Memoirs. He immediately instituted a prosecution on a\r\ncharge of murder against Brutus and his partisans, for having put to\r\ndeath without trial the first man in the state who was filling the\r\nhighest offices; and he named as the accuser of Brutus, Lucius\r\nCornificius, and Marcus Agrippa as the accuser of Cassius. Accordingly\r\nthey were condemned for default of appearance, the judices being\r\ncompelled to go to the vote. It is said that when the crier, according\r\nto custom, from the tribunal summoned Brutus into court, the mass gave a\r\nloud groan, and the nobles bent their heads to the ground and kept\r\nsilence; but that Publius Silicius was seen to shed tears, and for this\r\nreason was shortly after one of those who were proscribed. After this,\r\nthe three, Cæsar, Antonius and Lepidus, distributed the provinces among\r\nthem, and caused the slaughter and proscription of two hundred men,\r\namong whom Cicero perished.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. When the news of these events reached Macedonia, Brutus,[547]\r\ncompelled by circumstances, wrote to Hortensius to put Caius Antonius\r\nto death, on the ground of avenging Brutus and Cicero, the one being his\r\nfriend, and the other both a friend and kinsman. This was the reason why\r\nAntonius, when he afterwards took Hortensius at Philippi, put him to\r\ndeath on the tomb of his brother. Brutus says that he felt more shame at\r\nthe cause of Cicero's death than sympathy at his misfortune, and that he\r\nblamed his friends in Rome, for they were slain more through their own\r\nfault than that of the tyrants, and that they submitted to see and to\r\nwitness what it should have been intolerable for them even to hear.\r\nBrutus having taken his army over to Asia, which was now a considerable\r\nforce, set about fitting out a naval force in Bithynia[548] and in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cyzicus; and himself moving about with his troops\r\nsettled the cities and had interviews with the rulers; and he sent to\r\nCassius[549] into Syria to recall him from Egypt; for he said that it\r\nwas not to get dominion, but to deliver their country that they were\r\nrambling about and collecting a force with which they would put down the\r\ntyrants; that they ought therefore, remembering and keeping in mind this\r\npurpose, not to hold themselves far from Italy, but to hasten thither\r\nand to aid the citizens. Cassius obeyed, and Brutus met him on his\r\nreturn; and they fell in with one another near Smyrna, for the first\r\ntime since they had separated in Peiræus and set out, the one for\r\nSyria, the other for Macedonia. They had accordingly great pleasure and\r\nconfidence owing to the force which each had. For they had hurried from\r\nItaly like the most despicable fugitives, without money and without\r\narms, without a single ship, a single soldier, or a city, and yet after\r\nno very long interval they had come together with ships and troops and\r\nhorses and money, able to struggle for the supremacy of the Romans.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Now Cassius was desirous to have and to allow an equal share of\r\nhonour, but Brutus herein anticipated him by generally going to Cassius\r\nwho, in age, was his superior, and in body was not able to sustain equal\r\ntoil. The opinion was that Cassius was skilled in military matters, but\r\nwas violent in passion and governed mainly by fear, while towards his\r\nintimates he was too much inclined to use ridicule and was too fond of\r\njesting. As to Brutus, they say that he was esteemed by the many for his\r\nvirtues, but loved by his friends, admired by the nobles, and not hated\r\neven by his enemies, because the man was extraordinarily mild and\r\nhigh-minded and unmoved by anger, pleasure or love of aggrandisement,\r\nand kept his judgment upright and unbending in the maintenance of honour\r\nand justice. That which got him most goodwill and reputation was the\r\nfaith which men had in his motives. For neither that great Pompeius, if\r\nhe had put down Cæsar, was confidently expected to give up his power to\r\nthe laws, but to retain affairs in his hands, pacifying the people with\r\nthe name of consulship and dictatorship or some other title with more\r\npleasing name; and this Cassius, who was a violent and passionate man\r\nand was often carried away from justice in quest of gain, more than any\r\none else they thought would carry on war, and ramble about and expose\r\nhimself to danger for the purpose of getting power for himself, not\r\nliberty for the citizens. For as to the men of still earlier times, the\r\nCinnas and Marii and Carbos, they viewed their country as a prize and\r\nbooty for competition, and all but in express words fought to get a\r\ntyranny. But as to Brutus, they say that not even his enemies imputed to\r\nhim such a change in his purpose, but that many persons had heard\r\nAntonius say, he thought Brutus was the only person who conspired\r\nagainst Cæsar because of being moved by the splendour and apparent noble\r\nnature of the deed, and that the rest combined against the man because\r\nthey hated and envied him. Accordingly it appears from what Brutus says\r\nthat he trusted not so much in his power as in his virtues. He wrote to\r\nAtticus when he was just approaching the danger, that his affairs were\r\nin the best plight as to fortune, for that he should either get the\r\nvictory and free the Roman people, or should die and be released from\r\nslavery; and though everything else was safe and secure for them, one\r\nthing was uncertain, whether they should live and be free or die. He\r\nsays that Marcus Antonius was paying a just penalty for his folly, for\r\nwhile he might have been numbered with the Bruti and Cassii and Catos,\r\nhe made himself an appendage to Octavius, and if he should not be\r\ndefeated with him, he would shortly after have to fight against him. Now\r\nhe seems, in saying this, to have well divined what was to happen.\r\n\r\nXXX. While they were then in Smyrna, Brutus claimed a share of the money\r\nwhich Cassius had collected to a great amount, for Brutus alleged that\r\nhe had expended all his own resources in building so great a fleet with\r\nwhich they would command all the internal sea.[550] But the friends of\r\nCassius were not for letting him give up the money, saying, \"What you\r\nsave by economy and get with odium, it is not fair that he should take\r\nand apply to gaining popularity and gratifying the soldiers.\" However,\r\nCassius gave him a third part of all. Separating again to their several\r\nundertakings, Cassius, after taking Rhodes, did not conduct himself with\r\nmoderation, but made this answer at his entrance to those who addressed\r\nhim as king and lord: \"I am neither king nor lord, but the executioner\r\nand punisher of lord and king.\" Brutus demanded of the Lycians money and\r\nmen. When Naucrates the demagogue persuaded the cities to revolt, and\r\nthe people occupied certain heights to prevent Brutus from passing, in\r\nthe first place he sent cavalry against them when they were eating, who\r\nkilled six hundred of them; and in the next place taking possession of\r\nthe posts and forts, he released all the people without ransom with the\r\nview of gaining over the nation by kindness. But the people were\r\nobstinate, being enraged at what they had suffered, and despising his\r\nmoderation and humanity, till at last Brutus drove into Xanthas[551] the\r\nmost warlike of the Lycians, and blockaded them there. Some of them\r\nattempted to escape by swimming under the river which flowed by the\r\ncity: but they were caught by nets which were sunk in the channel to the\r\nbottom, and the tops of the nets had bells attached to them which gave a\r\nsignal as soon as any one was caught. The Xanthians, making a sally by\r\nnight, threw fire on certain engines; and when they were driven back\r\ninto the town by the Romans who perceived them, and a strong wind began\r\nto blow against the battlements the flame which was laying hold of the\r\nadjoining houses, Brutus, who feared for the city, ordered his soldiers\r\nto help to extinguish the fire.\r\n\r\nXXXI. But the Lycians were all at once seized with a horrible impulse to\r\ndespair surpassing all description, which might be best likened to a\r\npassion for death; for with their wives and children, both freemen and\r\nslaves, and people of every age, they threw missiles from the walls upon\r\nthe enemy who were assisting to quench the flames, and carrying reeds\r\nand wood and everything combustible, they drew the fire to the city,\r\noffering to it all kinds of material and in every way exciting and\r\nfeeding it. As the flames rushed onwards and engirdling the city blazed\r\nforth with violence, Brutus, in great affliction at what was going on,\r\nrode round the walls, being eager to save the people, and stretching out\r\nhis hands to the Xanthians he prayed them to spare themselves and save\r\nthe city; and yet no one regarded him, but in every way they sought to\r\ndestroy themselves; and not only men and women, but even the little\r\nchildren; with cries and shouts, some leaped into the fire and others\r\nbroke their necks from the walls, and others presented their throats to\r\ntheir fathers' knives, baring them and bidding them strike. After the\r\ncity was destroyed, there was found a woman suspended by a rope, with a\r\ndead child hung to her neck, and firing the house with a lighted torch.\r\nThis tragical sight Brutus could not endure to see, and he wept at\r\nhearing of it; and he proclaimed that a reward should be given to every\r\nsoldier who could save a Lycian. They say that there were only one\r\nhundred and fifty who did not escape being saved. Now the Xanthians\r\nafter a long interval, as if they were reproducing a fated period of\r\ndestruction, renewed the fortune of their ancestors in their\r\ndesperation; for their ancestors in like manner in the time of the\r\nPersians burnt their city and destroyed themselves.\r\n\r\nXXXII. Brutus seeing that the city of Patara was preparing to resist him\r\nwas unwilling to attack it, and was perplexed because he feared the same\r\ndesperation; and as he had their women captive, he let them go without\r\nransom. These women, who were the wives and daughters of distinguished\r\nmen, reported of Brutus that he was a most moderate and just man, and\r\nthey persuaded the citizens to yield and to surrender the city. Upon\r\nthis all the rest of the Lycians surrendered and gave themselves up to\r\nhim, and they found him to be honourable and merciful beyond their\r\nexpectation; for while Cassius about the same time compelled all the\r\nRhodians to bring in the gold and silver which was their private\r\nproperty, and a sum of eight thousand talents was thus collected, and\r\nmulcted the commonwealth of the city in five hundred talents besides,\r\nBrutus only demanded of the Lycians a hundred and fifty talents, and\r\nwithout doing them any other wrong set out for Ionia.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. Now Brutus did many deeds worthy of remembrance both in\r\nrewarding and punishing according to desert; but that with which he\r\nhimself was most pleased and the best of the Romans, I will relate. When\r\nPompeius Magnus landed in Egypt at Pelusium, what time he fled after\r\nbeing completely defeated by Cæsar, the guardians of the king, who was\r\nstill a youth, being in counsel with their friends, were not inclined\r\nthe same way in their opinions. Some were for receiving and others for\r\ndriving the man from Egypt. But one Theodotus[552] of Chios, who was\r\nhired to teach the king rhetoric, and was then thought worthy of a place\r\nin the council for want of better men, attempted to show that both were\r\nin error, those who advised to receive and those who advised to send\r\naway Pompeius, for there was one thing in the present circumstances\r\nthat was useful, and that was to receive him and put him to death. And\r\nhe added, at the end of his speech, that a corpse does not bite. The\r\ncouncil assented to his opinion, and Pompeius Magnus fell, an instance\r\nof things passing belief and expectation, and the result of the\r\nrhetorical skill and eloquence of Theodotus, as the sophist himself used\r\nto say boastingly. When Cæsar arrived shortly after, some of them paid\r\nthe penalty of their guilt and perished miserably; and Theodotus, who\r\nborrowed from fortune a short period for an inglorious and poor and\r\nrambling life, did not escape Brutus when he came into Asia, but he was\r\ncarried before him and punished, and thus he gained a greater name by\r\nhis death than by his life.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. Brutus invited Cassius to Sardis[553] and met him with his\r\nfriends on his approach; and the whole force under arms saluted both of\r\nthem as Imperatores. Now as it is wont to happen in the midst of great\r\naffairs, and among many friends and commanders, causes of difference had\r\narisen between Brutus and Cassius, and suspicions; and before they did\r\nanything else, immediately on their arrival at Sardis they entered into\r\na room by themselves and closed the door, and no one being present they\r\nbegan with blaming one another, and then fell to proofs and charges.\r\nFrom this they came to tears and passionate expressions without\r\nrestraint, so that their friends, wondering at the roughness and\r\nviolence of their anger, feared lest something should happen; but it was\r\nforbidden to approach them. But Marcus Favonius, who had been a lover of\r\nCato, and was a philosopher not so much from reason as a certain impulse\r\nand mad passion, went in to them though the slaves attempted to hinder\r\nhim. But it was a hard thing to check Favonius when he had put himself\r\nin motion towards any object, for he was impetuous in all things and\r\nimpatient. He made no account of being a Roman senator, but by his\r\ncynical freedom of speech he often took away the harshness and\r\nunseasonableness of his behaviour, the hearers receiving all as jest. On\r\nthis occasion forcing his way against those who tried to stop him, he\r\nentered, and with mock solemnity uttered the words which Homer[554] has\r\nmade Nestor use:\r\n\r\n   \"Obey: ye both are younger far than I,\"\r\n\r\nand what follows. At which Cassius laughed, but Brutus turned him out,\r\ncalling him true dog and false cynic. However, they forthwith became\r\nreconciled, and this was the end of their difference for the time.\r\nCassius gave an entertainment to which Brutus invited his friends.[555]\r\nAs they were just reclining, Favonius came from the bath; and, on Brutus\r\ndeclaring that he came without invitation and bidding him withdraw to\r\nthe highest couch,[556] he forced his way to the central couch and\r\nreclined there; and they made merry over the banquet, and the mirth was\r\nnot without its zest nor unseasoned with philosophy.\r\n\r\nXXXV. On the following day Lucius Pella,[557] a Roman who had been\r\nprætor and trusted by Brutus, was charged by the people of Sardis with\r\ntaking money unlawfully, and he was publicly condemned and declared\r\ninfamous by Brutus. This affair gave Cassius no small pain. For a few\r\ndays before, two of his friends who were convicted of the same offence,\r\nhe privately admonished and publicly acquitted, and he still continued\r\nto employ them. Accordingly he blamed Brutus as being too strict an\r\nobserver of law and justice at a time which required politic conduct and\r\nconciliatory measures. But Brutus told him to remember the Ides of\r\nMarch on which they killed Cæsar, who was not himself oppressing and\r\nplundering everybody, but supported others who did it, so that if there\r\nwas any specious pretext for overlooking justice, it would have been\r\nbetter to bear with Cæsar's friends than to allow their own friends to\r\ndo wrong. For they, he said,[558] have the imputation of cowardice, but\r\nwe of injustice, and that too joined to danger and toil. Such were the\r\nprinciples of Brutus.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.[559] When they were going to cross over from Asia, it is said\r\nthat Brutus had a great sign. The man was naturally wakeful, and by\r\ndiscipline and temperance he contracted his sleep into a small space of\r\ntime, never reposing in the daytime, and by night only so long as he was\r\nunable to do anything or to speak to any one because people were\r\nresting. But at that time when the war was on foot, having on his hands\r\nthe general management of everything, and his thoughts being on the\r\nstretch with regard to the future, when he had taken a short repose\r\nafter eating, he employed the rest of the night on affairs of urgency.\r\nAnd when he had finished and arranged everything that was necessary\r\nabout such matters, he would read a book till the third watch, at which\r\ntime the centurions and tribunes were used to come to him. Being then\r\nabout to convoy his army over from Asia, it happened to be dead of night\r\nand the lamp in his tent was not very bright; and the whole camp was in\r\ndeep silence. As Brutus was considering and reflecting with himself, he\r\nthought that he heard some one come in, and looking towards the entrance\r\nhe saw a terrible and strange vision of a huge and frightful figure\r\nstanding by him in silence. He had the courage to ask, \"What man or god\r\nart thou, or with what purpose dost thou come to us?\" The phantom\r\nreplied to him, \"I am thy evil dæmon, Brutus, and thou shalt see me at\r\nPhilippi.\" And Brutus without being disturbed, said, \"I shall see.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVII.[560] When the phantom disappeared, Brutus called the slaves,\r\nand as they said that they had neither heard any voice nor seen\r\nanything, Brutus still kept awake; and at daybreak he betook himself to\r\nCassius and told him his vision. Cassius, who followed the doctrines of\r\nEpicurus, and was accustomed to dispute about them with Brutus, said,\r\n\"Our opinion, Brutus, is this, that we do not in fact feel all things\r\nnor see them, but perception is a certain flexible and deceitful thing,\r\nand the intellect is still quicker to move and change it, without there\r\nbeing any real thing, into all forms. For the fashioning of the form is\r\nlike unto wax, and as the soul of man possesses both the thing to be\r\nfashioned and that which fashions, being the same, it has of itself the\r\npower of most easily varying itself and assuming different forms. And\r\nthis is shown by the changes of our dreams in sleep, which changes the\r\nphantastic power undergoes, from slight causes assuming every kind of\r\neffect and image. It is the nature of the phantastic power to be always\r\nin motion, and motion is to it a certain phantasy or perception. In you\r\nthe body being troubled naturally excites and perverts the mind. But it\r\nis neither probable that there are dæmons, nor that, if there are, they\r\nhave the form of men or the voice, or that their power reaches to us;\r\nand indeed I wish it were so, that we might not put trust only in arms\r\nand horses and so many ships, but also in the help of the gods being the\r\nleaders in most upright and noble undertakings.\" By such arguments as\r\nthese Cassius attempted to calm Brutus. When the soldiers were\r\nembarking, two eagles descended on the first standards and were carried\r\nalong with them, and accompanied the soldiers, who fed them, as far as\r\nPhilippi. And there, one day before the battle, they flew away.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. Now Brutus had subjected to him most of the nations that lay in\r\nhis way: and if any city or ruler had been passed by, they then brought\r\nover all in their progress as far as the sea opposite to Thasos. In\r\nthose parts Norbanus[561] and his troops happened to be encamped in the\r\nStraits and about Symbolum; but Brutus and Cassius getting round them\r\ncompelled them to withdraw and desert the posts. They also came very\r\nnear taking his force, Cæsar staying behind on account of illness; and\r\nthey would have done it, if Antonius had not come to their aid with such\r\nwonderful expedition that Brutus could scarce believe it. Cæsar arrived\r\nten days later, and pitched his camp opposite to Brutus: Antonius took\r\nhis station opposite to Cassius. The plain which lay between the armies,\r\nthe Romans called the Campi Philippi; and it was on this occasion that\r\nthe largest Roman armies were matched against one another. Now in\r\nnumbers they were not a little inferior to those of Cæsar, but in show\r\nand splendour of arms the forces of Brutus outshone the enemy. For most\r\nof their armour was of gold, and silver had been unsparingly supplied,\r\nthough in other respects Brutus accustomed his officers to a simple and\r\nsevere habit. But he thought that the wealth which they had in their\r\nhands and about their bodies, would give courage to the more ambitious\r\nof honour and would make those who were fond of gain still more\r\ncourageous, as if the weapons which they held were their property.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Now Cæsar made a lustration[562] within his lines, and\r\ndistributed among the soldiers a small allowance of grain and five\r\ndrachmæ apiece for the sacrifice; but Brutus, who considered this either\r\nas proof of Cæsar's poverty or his meanness, first of all performed a\r\nlustration for the army under the open sky, according to the custom, and\r\nthen distributed a number of victims for every cohort, and fifty drachmæ\r\nto each man, by which he had the advantage over the enemy in the\r\ngoodwill and zeal of his troops. Notwithstanding this bad omen, as\r\nCassius considered it, happened during the lustration; for the lictor\r\nbrought him his crown reversed. It is said that on a former occasion,\r\nalso during a certain spectacle and procession, a golden Victory\r\nbelonging to Cassius, which was being carried, fell down owing to the\r\nbearer slipping. Besides this many birds of prey daily appeared in the\r\ncamp and swarms of bees were seen collecting about a certain spot within\r\nthe lines, which the diviners enclosed in order to get rid of the\r\nsuperstitious fear which was gradually withdrawing even Cassius himself\r\nfrom the principles of Epicurus, and had completely cowed the soldiers.\r\nOwing to this, Cassius was not eager that the matter should be decided\r\nat present by a battle, and he was of opinion that they should protract\r\nthe war, being strong in resources, but in amount of arms and men\r\ninferior to the enemy. But Brutus even before this was eager to settle\r\nthe matter by the speediest hazard, and thus either to recover freedom\r\nfor his country, or to relieve from their sufferings all the people who\r\nwere oppressed by cost and military service and requisitions. And now\r\nseeing that his cavalry was successful and victorious in the skirmishes\r\nand encounters of posts, his spirit was raised: and some desertions to\r\nthe enemy which took place and imputations and suspicions against others\r\ncaused many of the friends of Cassius in the council to go over to the\r\nopinion of Brutus. One of the friends of Brutus, Atillius, opposed the\r\nopinion of Brutus and advised that they should wait for the winter. On\r\nBrutus asking, Wherein he thought that he would be better after a year,\r\nhe replied, If in nothing else, I shall live longer. Cassius was vexed\r\nat this, and Atillius gave no small offence to the rest. Accordingly it\r\nwas resolved to fight on the next day.\r\n\r\nXL. Brutus went to rest after having been in high spirits and engaged in\r\nphilosophical discourse at supper. As to Cassius, Messala[563] says that\r\nhe supped by himself with a few of his intimates, and appeared\r\nthoughtful and silent, though he was not naturally so; and that after\r\nsupper he pressed the hand of Messala strongly and said, as he was wont\r\nwhen he was in friendly mood, in the Greek language, \"I call you to\r\nwitness, Messala, that I am in the same situation as Pompeius Magnus,\r\nbeing compelled to cast the die for my country's safety in a single\r\nbattle. However, let us have a good heart, looking to fortune, which it\r\nis not right to distrust, though we may have resolved badly.\" Messala\r\nsays that these were the last words that Cassius spoke to him and\r\nthereon embraced him, and that he was invited[564] by him to supper for\r\nthe following day, which was his birthday. At daybreak there was hung\r\nout in the lines of Brutus and of Cassius the signal for the contest, a\r\npurple vest, and they met between the two camps, and Cassius said:\r\n\"Brutus, I hope we may be victorious and live together happily all the\r\nrest of our lives; but as the chief of human events are the most\r\nuncertain, and if the battle results contrary to our expectation, it\r\nwill not be easy for us to see one another, what do you intend with\r\nrespect to flight or death?\" Brutus replied, \"When I was a young man,\r\nCassius, and inexperienced in affairs, I know not how it happened that I\r\nneglected a weighty matter in philosophy. I blamed Cato for killing\r\nhimself, considering that it was not right nor befitting a man to\r\nwithdraw himself from his dæmon, and not to await what happens without\r\nfear, but to skulk away. But now I am of a different mind in the\r\ncircumstances, and if the deity shall not determine in our favour, I do\r\nnot want to try other hopes and means, but I will withdraw content with\r\nfortune, that on the Ides of March I gave to my country my life and have\r\nlived another life for her sake free and glorious.\" Whereat Cassius\r\nsmiled and, embracing Brutus, said, \"With such thoughts let us go\r\nagainst the enemy; for we shall either conquer or we shall not fear the\r\nconquerors.\" After this they discussed the order of battle in the\r\npresence of their friends. Brutus asked Cassius to allow him to command\r\nthe right wing, which was supposed to be more appropriate for Cassius on\r\naccount of his experience and his age. But Cassius granted even this,\r\nand he commanded Messala with the bravest of the legions to be posted on\r\nthe right. Brutus immediately led forth the cavalry equipped in splendid\r\nstyle, and he brought up the infantry with equal expedition.\r\n\r\nXLI. The soldiers of Antonius happened to be driving trenches from the\r\nmarshes, around which they were encamped, into the plain and cutting off\r\nthe approaches of Cassius to the sea. Cæsar was on the watch, not being\r\npresent himself by reason of sickness, but his troops were there, which,\r\nhowever, did not expect that the enemy would fight, but would merely\r\nmake sallies against the works and disturb the diggers with light\r\nmissiles and shouts; and as they were paying no attention to those who\r\nwere opposed to them, they were surprised at the shouts about the\r\ntrenches, which were indistinct and loud. In the meantime billets came\r\nfrom Brutus to the officers in which the word was written, and as he was\r\nadvancing on horseback before the legions and encouraging them, a few\r\nhad time to hear the word as it was passed along, but the greater part\r\nwithout waiting, with one impulse and shout rushed against the enemy.\r\nSome irregularity arose in the lines and some separation of them through\r\nthis disorder, and the legion of Messala first and those which were\r\nclose upon it outflanked Cæsar's left; and having slightly touched the\r\nsoldiers on the extreme left and killed no great number, but completely\r\noutflanking them, fell on the camp. Cæsar, as he says in his Memoirs,\r\ninasmuch as one of his friends, Artorius Marcus,[565] had seen a vision\r\nin his sleep which bade Cæsar get out of the way and leave the camp, had\r\njust before been conveyed out of it, and he was supposed to have lost\r\nhis life; for the enemy pierced his empty litter with javelins and\r\nspears. And there was a slaughter in the camp of those who were\r\ncaptured, and two thousand Lacedæmonians, who had lately come as allies,\r\nwere cut to pieces with them.\r\n\r\nXLII. They who had not surrounded the soldiers of Cæsar, but had engaged\r\nwith those in front, easily put to flight the enemy who were in\r\nconfusion, and destroyed at close quarters three legions, and they\r\nrushed into the camp with the fugitives, carried along by the\r\nimpetuosity of success and having Brutus with them; but what the victors\r\ndid not see, that the critical time showed to the vanquished. For\r\npushing forward to the parts of the opposite line which were exposed and\r\nbroken where the right wing was drawn off in the pursuit, they did not\r\nforce the centre but were engaged in a violent struggle; but they put to\r\nflight the left, which was in disorder and ignorant of what had\r\nhappened, and pursuing it to the camp they plundered it, neither of the\r\nImperatores being with them. For Antonius, as they say, having at the\r\nbeginning avoided the attack, retreated to the marsh, and Cæsar could\r\nnowhere be seen, as he had fled from the camp; but some showed their\r\nbloody swords to Brutus supposing they had killed him, and describing\r\nhis appearance and age. And now the centre had repelled their opponents\r\nwith great slaughter; and Brutus thought that he was completely\r\nvictorious as Cassius thought that he was defeated. And this was the\r\nonly thing which ruined their cause, that Brutus did not aid Cassius\r\nbecause he thought that he was victorious, and that Cassius did not wait\r\nfor Brutus because he thought that he had perished; for Messala\r\nconsiders it a proof of victory that Brutus had taken three eagles and\r\nmany standards from the enemy, and the enemy had taken nothing. Brutus\r\nnow retreating after he had destroyed Cæsar's camp, was surprised not to\r\nsee the tent of Cassius standing out conspicuous, as usual, nor the rest\r\nin their place, for most of the tents had immediately been thrown down\r\nand torn in pieces by the enemy when they broke in. But those who\r\nthought they could see better than their comrades said to Brutus that\r\nthey saw many helmets glittering and many silver shields moving about in\r\nthe camp of Cassius, and they said it did not appear to them that it was\r\neither the number or the armour of those were left to guard the camp,\r\nbut yet there did not appear to be in that direction a number of corpses\r\nsuch as might be expected if so many legions had been defeated. This\r\nwas the first thing that gave Brutus an idea of the misfortune; and\r\nleaving a guard in the camp of the enemy he recalled the pursuers and\r\ngot them together to aid Cassius.\r\n\r\nXLIII. And it had fared thus with him. He was neither pleased at seeing\r\nthe first onset of the soldiers of Brutus without signal and order, nor\r\nwas he pleased that when they were victorious they rushed straight to\r\nplunder and profit, taking no pains to get round and encircle the enemy.\r\nCassius, conducting his operations rather with delay and waste of time\r\nthan with vigour and judgment, was surrounded by the right wing of the\r\nenemy; and when he saw that, as soon as the cavalry broke away in flight\r\nto the sea, the infantry also were giving way, he endeavoured to stop\r\nand recall them. He also seized the standard from one of the\r\nstandard-bearers who was flying, and fixed it in the ground before his\r\nfeet, though even those who were placed about his person no longer\r\nremained with any spirit. In these circumstances, being pressed, he\r\nretreated with a few men to a hill which had a view towards the plain.\r\nHe saw nothing in the plain, or with difficulty the plunder of the camp,\r\nfor he was weak of vision; but the horsemen around him saw many\r\napproaching whom Brutus sent. Cassius conjectured that they were enemies\r\nand were in pursuit of him; yet he sent Titinius, one of those who were\r\nwith him, to see. The horsemen did not fail to observe him approaching,\r\nand when they saw a man who was a friend, and faithful to Cassius, they\r\nshouted for joy, and some of his friends leaping down from their horses\r\nembraced him and took his hand, and the rest riding round him with\r\njoyful shouts and clatter by their unmeasured rejoicing produced the\r\ngreatest misfortune. For Cassius was quite sure that Titinius was caught\r\nby the enemy. With these words, \"Through love of life have I waited to\r\nsee a friend seized by the enemy,\" he retired into an empty tent\r\ndragging after him one of his freed men, Pindarus, whom, in the\r\nunfortunate affair of Crassus, he had prepared for this extremity.\r\nCassius escaped the Parthians, but now drawing his cloak over his head\r\nand baring his neck he presented it to be cut asunder; for the head was\r\nfound separated from the body. But no man saw Pindarus after the death\r\nof Cassius, which made some persons think that he had killed Cassius\r\nwithout his order. Shortly after the horsemen appeared, and Titinius\r\ncrowned by them went up to Cassius. But when, by the weeping and cries\r\nof his friends who were lamenting and bewailing, he knew of the fate of\r\nthe general and of his error, he drew his sword and with much upbraiding\r\nof himself for his tardiness killed himself.\r\n\r\nXLIV. Brutus, who was acquainted with the defeat of Cassius, was now\r\napproaching, and he heard of his death when he was near the camp. After\r\nlamenting over the body and calling Cassius the last of the Romans, as\r\nif he considered that such a spirit could never again be produced in\r\nRome, he wrapped up the corpse and sent it to Thasos, that no disorder\r\nmight be produced by its being interred there. He summoned the soldiers\r\ntogether and consoled them; and seeing that they were deprived of all\r\nnecessaries he promised them two thousand drachmæ apiece in place of\r\nwhat they had lost. The soldiers were encouraged by his words and\r\nadmired the magnitude of his present; and they accompanied him with\r\nshouts as he went away, magnifying him as the only one of the four\r\nImperatores who was unvanquished in battle. And the result proved that\r\nhe had good reason for trusting to success in the battle; for with a few\r\nlegions he put to flight all those who opposed him. But if he had\r\nemployed all his forces in the battle, and the greater part had not\r\npassed by the enemy and fallen on the enemy's baggage, it is probable\r\nthat he would have left no part of the enemy's force unvanquished.\r\n\r\nXLV. There fell on the side of Brutus eight thousand, with the slaves\r\nwho were with them in the army, whom Brutus called Briges;[566] and of\r\nthe enemy Messala says that he thinks more than twice the number fell.\r\nFor this reason the enemy was the more dispirited, till a slave of\r\nCassius, named Demetrius, came to Antonius as soon as it was evening,\r\nhaving taken the cloaks from the corpse, and the sword; and when these\r\nwere brought, they were so much encouraged that at daybreak they led\r\nforth their force prepared for battle. But as both his armies were in an\r\nunsettled and dangerous state (for his own army being full of captives\r\nrequired careful watching, and the army of Cassius was troubled at the\r\nloss of their general, and they felt somewhat of envy and dislike in\r\nconsequence of their defeat towards the army that had been victorious),\r\nBrutus resolved to put his troops under arms, but he would not fight. Of\r\nthe captives, he ordered the slaves to be killed, as they were moving\r\nabout among the soldiers in a suspicious way; but of the freemen he\r\nreleased some, saying that they had rather been made captives by the\r\nenemy, and were captives and slaves there, but with him were free men\r\nand citizens; and when he saw that his friends and the officers were\r\nill-disposed towards them, he saved them by concealing them and sending\r\nthem away. There were a certain Volumnius,[567] a mime, and Saculio, a\r\njester, among the prisoners, whom Brutus cared not for, and his friends\r\nbringing these to him accused them of not abstaining even now from\r\nspeaking and jeering to insult them. Brutus was silent, being occupied\r\nwith other thoughts, but Messala Corvinus was of opinion that they\r\nshould be flogged in a tent, and given up naked to the generals of the\r\nenemy, that they might know what kind of drinking companions and\r\nintimates they wanted in their campaigns. Some of those who were present\r\nlaughed; but Publius Casca, who had struck Cæsar first, said, \"We offer\r\nno fit sacrifice to Cassius who is dead, by making merry and jesting;\r\nbut you, Brutus,\" he said, \"will show what remembrance you have of the\r\ngeneral either by punishing or protecting those who will mock and revile\r\nhim.\" Upon this Brutus, greatly angered, said, \"Why then do you ask me,\r\nCasca, and why don't you do what you like?\" This answer of Brutus they\r\nconsidered as an assent to the punishment of the unhappy men, whom they\r\nled away and put to death.\r\n\r\nXLVI. After this Brutus gave the soldiers their present, and blaming\r\nthem mildly for not having waited for the word, and having fallen on the\r\nenemy somewhat disorderly without waiting for the order, he promised\r\nthem if they were victorious to give up to them for plunder and profit\r\ntwo cities, Thessalonica[568] and Lacedæmon. This is the only thing in\r\nthe life of Brutus which he is charged with that admits of no defence,\r\nthough Antonius and Cæsar paid to their soldiers a much more terrible\r\nprice as the reward of their victories, for they drove the old settlers\r\nout of nearly the whole of Italy, that their soldiers might have land\r\nand cities to which they had no claim. But with Antonius and Cæsar\r\ndominion and power was the end which they proposed to themselves in the\r\nwar, while Brutus, owing to his reputation for virtue, was not allowed\r\nby the many either to conquer or to save his life otherwise than by\r\nhonourable and just means; and especially now that Cassius was dead, who\r\nhad the imputation of urging Brutus on to some of his more violent acts.\r\nBut as at sea when the helm is broken, they attempt to nail on other\r\npieces of wood, and to fit them, not skilfully indeed, but as well as\r\nthey can under circumstances, fighting against the necessity, so Brutus\r\nwith so great a force around him, and in so hazardous a state of\r\naffairs, having no commander of equal weight with himself, was compelled\r\nto employ those who were with him, and to do and say many things\r\naccording to their pleasure. And he judged it fit to do whatever he\r\nthought would improve the disposition of the soldiers of Cassius, for\r\nthey were difficult to manage: in the camp being unruly for want of\r\ndiscipline, and towards the enemy having a feeling of cowardice by\r\nreason of their defeat.\r\n\r\nXLVII. Affairs were no better with Cæsar and Antonius, for they were\r\nscantily supplied with provisions, and owing to the camp being pitched\r\nin a hollow, they expected a bad winter. For being among marshes and the\r\nautumnal rains coming on after the battle, they had their tents filled\r\nwith mud and with water which froze immediately through the cold. While\r\nthey were in this condition, news arrived of the misfortune that had\r\nbefallen their forces at sea. For the ships of Brutus[569] fell upon\r\nthem, and destroyed a large force that was coming to Cæsar from Italy,\r\nand only a very few of the men escaped, who were compelled by famine to\r\neat the sails and ropes. On hearing this news they were eager to settle\r\nthe matter by a battle before Brutus was aware of the great good fortune\r\nthat had come to him; for it happened that in the same day the battle by\r\nland and the battle by sea were determined. But by some chance rather\r\nthan through the fault of the commanders of the fleet, Brutus was\r\nignorant of the success, though twenty days had elapsed. For otherwise\r\nhe would not have gone out to a second battle when he was provided with\r\nall necessaries for his army for a long time and was posted in a good\r\nposition, wherein he could have maintained his army in the winter free\r\nfrom all suffering and safe against the attacks of the enemy, and by\r\nbeing master of the sea, and having defeated by land the troops opposed\r\nto him, was in high hopes and spirits. But affairs, as it appears, being\r\nno longer governable by a number, and requiring a monarchy, the deity\r\nwishing to lead away and to remove the only person who stood in the way\r\nof him who was able to govern, cut off the news of that good fortune,\r\nthough it came exceeding near to being communicated to Brutus. For the\r\nday before that on which he was going to fight, and late in the day,\r\nthere came one Clodius, a deserter from the enemy, who reported, that\r\nCæsar was eager to come to a decisive contest because he had heard of\r\nthe destruction of his armament. The man got no credit for his report\r\nnor did he come into the presence of Brutus, being altogether despised\r\nas one who had heard no well-founded news, or reported falsehood to get\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. In that night it is said that the phantom again appeared to\r\nBrutus, and displaying the same appearance said nothing and went away.\r\nBut Publius Volumnius,[570] a philosopher and one who accompanied Brutus\r\nin his campaign from the first, says that this was not the sign; but he\r\nsays that the first eagle was covered with bees, and from the arm of one\r\nof the centurions an oil of roses spontaneously burst out, and though\r\nthey often rubbed it off and wiped it away, it was all to no use.\r\nFurther, before the battle, two eagles met and fought in the space\r\nbetween the armies, and a silence past belief filled the plain while all\r\nwere looking on, but at last the eagle which was on the side of Brutus\r\ngave way and fled. The Ethiopian became notorious, he who met the\r\neagle-bearer as soon as the gate was opened, and was cut down with their\r\nswords by the soldiers, who considered it a bad omen.\r\n\r\nXLIX. After Brutus had made the line advance, and had placed it in front\r\nof the enemy, he paused some time, for suspicions reached him and\r\ninformation against certain persons while he was inspecting the army;\r\nand he observed that the cavalry were not very eager to begin the\r\nbattle, but were still waiting for the infantry to commence the attack.\r\nAll of a sudden, a man of military skill, who had been particularly\r\ndistinguished for his courage, rode past Brutus himself and passed over\r\nto the enemy: his name was Camulatus. Brutus was greatly pained at\r\nseeing this, and partly through passion, partly through fear of greater\r\nchange and treachery, he forthwith led his men against the enemy, the\r\nsun now going down, to the ninth hour. Brutus had the advantage with his\r\nown troops, and he pushed on, pressing upon the left wing of the enemy\r\nwhich gave way, and the cavalry supported him by charging together with\r\nthe infantry the disordered ranks; but the other wing, which the\r\ncommanders extended for fear of being surrounded, was inferior in\r\nnumbers, and was drawn out in the centre, and thus becoming weak, did\r\nnot resist the enemy, but fled first. The enemy, having broken this\r\nwing, immediately surrounded Brutus, who displayed all the virtues of a\r\ngeneral and a soldier, both in his personal exertions, and his prudent\r\nmeasures in the midst of danger to secure victory; but he was damaged by\r\nthat circumstance whereby he gained advantage in the former battle. For\r\nin that battle the part of the enemy which was defeated had perished;\r\nbut few perished of the troops of Cassius, though they were put to\r\nflight, and those who escaped being very timid through their former\r\ndefeat, filled the chief part of the army with despondency and\r\nconfusion. On this occasion also, Marcus the son of Cato,[571] fighting\r\namong the noblest and bravest of the youth, though hard pressed, did not\r\nyield nor flee, but laying about him and calling out who he was, and his\r\nfather's name, he fell on a heap of the enemy's slain. There fell, too,\r\nthe bravest of the men, exposing themselves in defence of Brutus.\r\n\r\nL. Among the intimates of Brutus was one Lucilius,[572] a good man.\r\nObserving that some barbarian horsemen in their pursuit paid no regard\r\nto the rest, but rode at full speed after Brutus, he resolved at his own\r\nrisk to stop them. And being a little in the rear he said that he was\r\nBrutus, and he gained belief by praying them to take him to Antonius,\r\nbecause he feared Cæsar, but trusted in Antonius. The barbarians\r\ndelighted at their success, and considering that they had surprising\r\ngood luck, conducted the man, and as it was now growing dark, sent\r\nforward some of their number as messengers to Antonius. Antonius, much\r\npleased, went to meet those who were conducting Lucilius; and those who\r\nheard that Brutus was being brought alive flocked together, some pitying\r\nhim for his ill fortune, and others thinking it unworthy of his fame to\r\nlet himself be taken by barbarians through love of life. When they were\r\nnear, Antonius stopped, being doubtful how he should receive Brutus, but\r\nLucilius, approaching with a cheerful countenance, said, \"Antonius, no\r\nenemy has taken Marcus Brutus, nor will: may fortune never have such a\r\nvictory over virtue. But he will be found, whether alive or dead, in a\r\ncondition worthy of himself. But I who have deceived your soldiers am\r\ncome to suffer, and I deprecate no punishment, however severe, for what\r\nI have done.\" When Lucilius had said this, and all were in amaze,\r\nAntonius, looking on those who conducted Lucilius, said, \"I suppose,\r\nfellow soldiers, you are vexed at your mistake, and think that you have\r\nbeen grossly tricked. But be assured that you have taken a better prey\r\nthan that which you were in search of. For while you were seeking for an\r\nenemy, you have brought us a friend; for as to Brutus, I know not by the\r\ngods, what I should have done with him if he were alive, but such men as\r\nthis, I pray that I may have as friends rather than as enemies.\" Saying\r\nthis he embraced Lucilius and for the time placed him with one of his\r\nfriends, but he afterwards employed him, and found him in everything\r\nfaithful and true.\r\n\r\nLI. Brutus, having crossed a certain stream, the banks of which were\r\nlined with wood and steep, just when it began to be dark, did not\r\nadvance far, but seating himself in a hollow spot where there was a\r\nlarge rock spread out, with a few of his officers and friends about him,\r\nfirst looked up to the heavens which were full of stars, and uttered two\r\nverses, one of which Volumnius has recorded:\r\n\r\n   \"Forget not,[573] Jove, the author of these ills;\"\r\n\r\nbut the other he says that he forgot. After a while naming each of his\r\ncompanions who had fallen in battle before his eyes, he grieved most\r\nover the memory of Flavius and Labeo. Labeo was his lieutenant, and\r\nFlavius the chief of the engineers. In the meantime one who was thirsty\r\nhimself and saw that Brutus was in the same plight, took a helmet and\r\nran down to the river. As a noise from the opposite side reached their\r\nears, Volumnius went forward to see, and Dardanus the shield-bearer with\r\nhim. Returning after a while they asked about the water; and Brutus,\r\nsmiling with a very friendly expression on Volumnius, said, \"It is drunk\r\nup, but some more shall be brought for you.\" The same person was sent,\r\nbut he was in danger of being taken by the enemy and escaped with\r\ndifficulty after being wounded. As Brutus conjectured that no great\r\nnumber of his men had fallen, Statyllius[574] undertook to make his way\r\nsecretly through the enemy, for it was not possible in any other way,\r\nand to inspect the camp, and after raising a fire-signal, if he should\r\nfind all safe there, to come back to him. The fire-signal was raised,\r\nfor Statyllius got to the camp, but as a long time elapsed and he did\r\nnot return, Brutus said, \"If Statyllius is alive he will come.\" But it\r\nhappened that, as he was returning, he fell among the enemy and was\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nLII.[575] In the course of the night, Brutus, as he sat on the ground,\r\nturned to his slave Kleitus and spoke to him. But as Kleitus kept\r\nsilence and shed tears, Brutus drew to him his shield-bearer Dardanus,\r\nand privately said something to him. At last employing the Greek\r\nlanguage he addressed Volumnius and reminded them of their\r\nphilosophical studies and discipline, and he urged him to put his hand\r\nto his sword and to aid him in the thrust. Volumnius refusing, and the\r\nrest being in the same disposition, and some one saying that they must\r\nnot stay there, but fly, Brutus sprang up and said, \"Certainly we must\r\nfly, yet not with the feet, but with the hands.\" Offering his right hand\r\nto each with a cheerful countenance, he said that he felt great\r\npleasure, that no one of his friends had deceived him, but he blamed\r\nfortune with respect to his country; as for himself, he considered that\r\nhe was happier than the conquerors, in that not yesterday nor yet\r\nrecently, but even now he left behind him a reputation for virtue, which\r\nthose would not leave behind who gained the victory by arms or by money,\r\nnor would they make people think that unjust and vile men who had\r\ndestroyed just and upright men did not rule unmeritedly. After\r\nentreating and urging them to save themselves, he retired a little\r\nfarther with two or three, among whom was Strato who had become intimate\r\nwith him from being his instructor in rhetoric. Putting Strato close to\r\nhim, and pressing the bare sword with both hands on the handle, he fell\r\nupon it and died. Others say that it was not Brutus himself, but Strato\r\nwho, at the earnest request of Brutus, held the sword under him,\r\naverting his eyes, and that Brutus throwing his breast upon it with\r\nviolence, and piercing it through, quickly died.\r\n\r\nLIII. Messala[576] who was a friend of Brutus and became reconciled to\r\nCæsar, once on a time when Cæsar was at leisure, brought this Strato to\r\nhim, and with tears in his eyes said, \"This, Cæsar, is the man who did\r\nthe last service to my Brutus.\" Cæsar received Strato and kept him about\r\nhim, and Strato was one of the Greeks who showed themselves brave men in\r\ndifficulties, and in the battle at Actium. They say that Messala himself\r\nbeing afterwards commended by Cæsar because, though he had been one of\r\ntheir greatest enemies at Philippi for the sake of Brutus, he had shown\r\nhimself most zealous at Actium, replied, \"Yes, Cæsar, I have always been\r\non the better and juster side.\" When Antonius found the body of\r\nBrutus,[577] he ordered it to be wrapped in the most costly of his\r\npurple vests; and when he afterwards discovered that the purple vest was\r\nstolen, he put the thief to death. The ashes he sent to Servilia, the\r\nmother of Brutus. Nikolaus[578] the philosopher and Valerius\r\nMaximus[579] relate that Porcia the wife of Brutus being desirous to\r\ndie, which none of her friends would allow, but kept close and watched\r\nher, snatched burning embers from the fire, and closing her mouth, so\r\ndied. Yet there is extant a letter of Brutus[580] to his friends in\r\nwhich he upbraids them and laments about Porcia, that she was neglected\r\nby them and had determined to die because of her sufferings from\r\ndisease. Nikolaus therefore appears not to have known the time, since\r\nthe letter, if it is genuine, informs us of the malady, and the love of\r\nthe woman and the manner of her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF DION AND BRUTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Among the glories of these two men's lives, it is especially to be\r\nnoticed, that each of them started from small beginnings, and yet raised\r\nhimself to the highest position in the state; and this fact is\r\npeculiarly honourable to Dion. Brutus owed much of his success to the\r\nhelp of Cassius, who, though less trustworthy than Brutus in matters of\r\nvirtue and honour, gave equal proofs of courage, skill, and energy in\r\nwar, while some writers go so far as to give him the entire credit of\r\nthe plot against Cæsar, and say that Brutus had no share in it. Dion on\r\nthe other hand was obliged to provide himself with friends and fellow\r\nconspirators, no less than with arms, ships, and soldiers. Furthermore,\r\nDion did not, like Brutus, gain wealth and power by the revolution and\r\nwar which he began, but even gave his own money to support the war, and\r\nspent the property on which he might have lived comfortably in exile in\r\norder to make his countrymen free. We must remember, also, that Brutus\r\nand Cassius could not have remained quiet after they left Rome, for they\r\nhad been condemned to death, and were being pursued, so that they were\r\nforced to fight in their own defence. When they risked their lives in\r\nbattle it was for themselves that they did so more than for their\r\ncountrymen, whereas Dion lived in exile more happily than the despot who\r\nbanished him, and nevertheless exposed himself to so terrible a hazard\r\nin order to set Sicily free.\r\n\r\nII. Yet it was not the same thing to free the Syracusans from Dionysius\r\nand to rid the Romans of Cæsar. Dionysius never denied that he was a\r\ndespot, and had inflicted countless miseries upon Sicily: while the\r\ngovernment of Cæsar, though its creation gave great offence, yet when\r\nit had been accepted and had overcome all opposition seemed to be a\r\ndespotism merely in name, for Cæsar did nothing cruel or arbitrary, and\r\nrather appeared to have been sent by heaven like a physician, to\r\nestablish an absolute monarchy in as mild a form as possible, at a time\r\nwhen that remedy was necessary for Rome. In consequence of this the\r\npeople of Rome were grieved at the death of Cæsar, and showed themselves\r\nharsh and inexorable to his murderers; while the severest charges which\r\nwere brought against Dion by his countrymen were that he had allowed\r\nDionysius to escape from Syracuse, and that he had not destroyed the\r\ntomb of the former despot.\r\n\r\nIII. In actual warfare Dion proved himself a faultless general, as he\r\nsucceeded brilliantly in every enterprise planned by himself, and was\r\nable to remedy the failures caused by the misconduct of others; while\r\nBrutus seems not to have been wise in engaging in the last decisive\r\nbattle, and when it was lost did not attempt to retrieve his fortunes,\r\nbut gave himself up to despair, showing even less confidence than\r\nPompeius. Yet, his position was far from hopeless, for he still retained\r\na large part of his army, and a fleet which gave him entire command of\r\nthe sea. Again, Dion cannot be accused of any crime like that which is\r\nthe greatest blot upon the character of Brutus, who after his life had\r\nbeen saved by Cæsar's goodness, and he had been allowed to save as many\r\nas he pleased of his fellow captives, after also he had been regarded by\r\nCæsar as his friend, and had been promoted by Cæsar above many others,\r\nmurdered his benefactor. On the contrary, Dion was the relative and\r\nfriend of Dionysius, and assisted him in maintaining his government, and\r\nit was not until he was expelled from his country, his wife wronged, and\r\nhis property confiscated, that he openly began a most just and lawful\r\nwar against the despot. Is there not, however, another view of this\r\nquestion? That hatred of despotism and wrong which is so highly\r\nhonoured, was possessed by Brutus pure and unalloyed by personal\r\nmotives, for he had no private grudge against Cæsar, and yet risked his\r\nlife on behalf of the liberty of the people: while Dion would never have\r\nmade war against Dionysius, if he had not been wronged by him. This we\r\nlearn distinctly from Plato's letters, which prove that Dion did not\r\nbegin his revolt until he was banished by Dionysius, after which, he\r\ndeposed the tyrant. A common object made Brutus become the friend of\r\nPompeius, who was Cæsar's enemy both personally and politically, for\r\nBrutus made men his friends or his enemies solely according to what he\r\nthought right: while Dion assisted Dionysius much while he was on\r\nfriendly terms with him, and only made war against him out of anger at\r\nhis loyalty being suspected. For this reason many even of his own\r\nfriends believed that after removing Dionysius from the throne he\r\nintended to succeed him, and to reign though under some title more\r\nplausible than that of despot; while even the enemies of Brutus admitted\r\nthat he alone of all the conspirators against Cæsar kept one object\r\nconsistently in view, which was to restore to the Romans their ancient\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIV. Apart from these considerations the struggle against Dionysius was\r\ndifferent from that against Cæsar. Dionysius was despised even by his\r\nown associates for wasting all his time with drink, dice, and women;\r\nwhereas it shows a certain magnanimity, and a spirit undismayed by any\r\ndanger, to have conceived the idea of dethroning Cæsar, and not to have\r\nbeen overawed by the wisdom, power, and good fortune of a man whose very\r\nname made the kings of Parthia and India uneasy in their sleep. As soon\r\nas Dion appeared in Sicily, thousands joined him to attack Dionysius,\r\nwhile the power of Cæsar's name even after his death rallied his\r\nfriends, and enabled a helpless child to become at once the first of the\r\nRomans by assuming it, as though it were a talisman to protect him\r\nagainst the might and hatred of Antonius. If it be said that Dion only\r\ndrove out Dionysius after many fierce battles, whereas Brutus stabbed\r\nCæsar when he was naked and unguarded, yet it was in itself a brilliant\r\npiece of generalship to have attacked so powerful a man when he was\r\nnaked and unguarded: for he did not attack him on a sudden impulse, or\r\nalone, or even with a few associates; but the plot had been laid long\r\nbefore, and many were concerned in it, yet none betrayed him. Either he\r\nchose only the bravest men, or else the mere fact of their having been\r\nchosen and trusted by Brutus made them brave. Dion on the other hand\r\ntrusted worthless men; and this is discreditable to his judgment, for\r\nthey must either have been villains when he chose them for his\r\nfollowers, or else they must have been originally good, and have become\r\nworse during their connection with him. Plato indeed blames him for\r\nchoosing such men for his friends, and at last he was murdered by them.\r\n\r\nV. No one avenged the murder of Dion; but Antonius, though Brutus's\r\nenemy, nevertheless buried him with honour, and Cæsar (Augustus) allowed\r\nthe honours which were paid to his memory to remain untouched. A brazen\r\nstatue of Brutus stands in the city of Milan, in Gaul, on this side of\r\nthe Alps. When Augustus saw this, which was a good likeness and a\r\ncapital piece of workmanship, he passed by it, but stopped shortly\r\nafterwards, and before a large audience called for the magistrates of\r\nthe city, and told them that he had caught them in the act of breaking\r\nthe peace by harbouring his enemy within their walls. They at first, as\r\nmay be imagined, denied the charge, and looked at one another, not\r\nknowing to whom he alluded. Augustus now turned round towards the\r\nstatue, and, knitting his brows, asked, \"Is not this my enemy who stands\r\nhere?\" At this the magistrates were even more abashed, and remained\r\nsilent. Augustus, however, smilingly commended the Gauls for remaining\r\ntrue to their friends in misfortune, and ordered the statue to be left\r\nwhere it stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ARTAXERXES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The first Artaxerxes, who surpassed all the kings of Persia in\r\nmildness and magnanimity of character, was surnamed Longhand, because\r\nhis right hand was larger than his left. He was the son of Xerxes; and\r\nArtaxerxes the Second, the subject of this memoir, who was surnamed\r\nMnemon, was the son of the former's daughter: for Darius and Parysatis\r\nhad four children, of whom the eldest was named Artaxerxes, the next\r\nCyrus, and the two younger ones Ostanes and Oxathres.\r\n\r\nCyrus was named after the ancient king of that name, who is said to have\r\nbeen taken from the sun; for the Persians are said to call the sun\r\nCyrus. Artaxerxes was originally named Arsikas, although the historian\r\nDeinon states that he was named Oarses. Still Ktesias, although his\r\nwritings are full of all kinds of absurd and incredible tales, must be\r\nsupposed to know the name of the king at whose court he lived, acting as\r\nphysician to him, his mother and his wife.\r\n\r\nII. Cyrus from his earliest youth displayed a determined and vehement\r\ndisposition, while his brother was gentler in all respects and less\r\npassionate in his desires. He married a fair and virtuous wife at his\r\nparents' command, and kept her against their will, for the king killed\r\nher brother, and wished to put her also to death, but Arsikas, by tears\r\nand entreaties, prevailed upon his mother to spare her life, and not to\r\nseparate her from him. His mother, however, always loved Cyrus more than\r\nArtaxerxes, and wished him to become king instead of his brother. For\r\nthis reason, when Cyrus was sent for from the coast during his father's\r\nlast illness, he went to court with great expectations, imagining that\r\nshe had managed to have him declared heir to the throne. Indeed,\r\nParysatis had a good argument for doing so, which had formerly, at the\r\nsuggestion of Demaratus, been acted upon by the old king Xerxes; namely,\r\nthat when Arsikas was born, Darius was merely a private man, but that\r\nwhen Cyrus was born he was a king. However, Parysatis did not succeed in\r\ninducing the king to declare Cyrus his heir, but the eldest son was\r\nproclaimed king and his name changed to Artaxerxes, while Cyrus was\r\nappointed satrap of Lydia and ruler of the provinces on the sea coast.\r\n\r\nIII. Shortly before the death of Darius, the king Artaxerxes travelled\r\nto Pasargadæ, in order that he might be initiated into the royal mystic\r\nrites by the priests there. The temple is dedicated to a warlike goddess\r\nwhom one might liken to Athena. The person to be initiated enters this\r\ntemple, removes his own clothes, and puts on those which the ancient\r\nCyrus wore before he became king. He then eats some of a cake made of\r\npreserved figs, tastes the fruit of the terebinth tree, and drinks a cup\r\nof sour milk. Whether besides this he does anything else is known only\r\nto the initiated. When Artaxerxes was about to do this Tissaphernes met\r\nhim, bringing with him one of the priests, who, when both the princes\r\nwere boys, had been Cyrus's teacher in the usual course of study, had\r\ntaught him to use incantations like a Magian, and had been especially\r\ngrieved at Cyrus not being proclaimed king. For this reason he more\r\neasily obtained credit when he accused Cyrus; and the accusation he\r\nbrought against him was that Cyrus intended to conceal himself in the\r\ntemple, and when the king took off his clothes, to attack him and murder\r\nhim. Some writers say that this was how Cyrus came to be apprehended,\r\nwhile others state that he actually got into the temple, and was there\r\nbetrayed by the priest. When he was about to be put to death, his mother\r\nthrew her arms round him, flung her hair over him, pressed his neck\r\nagainst her own, and by her tears and entreaties obtained his pardon,\r\nand got him sent back again to his government on the sea coast. He was\r\nnot satisfied with this position nor was he grateful for his pardon, but\r\nremembered only how he had been taken into custody, and through anger\r\nat this became all the more eager to gain the throne for himself.\r\n\r\nIV. Some writers say that he revolted because his revenues did not\r\nsuffice for his daily expenses; but this is absurd, since, if he could\r\nhave obtained it from no other source, his mother was always ready to\r\nsupply him, and used to give as much as he wanted from her own income.\r\nHis wealth also is proved by the large mercenary force which, we learn\r\nfrom Xenophon, was enlisted by his friends and guests in many different\r\nplaces: for he never collected it together, as he wished to conceal his\r\npreparations, but he kept many persons in different places who recruited\r\nsoldiers for him on various pretexts. His mother, who was present at\r\ncourt, lulled the king's suspicions, and Cyrus himself constantly wrote\r\nto him in dutiful terms, asking him to grant certain matters, and\r\nbringing accusations against Tissaphernes, as though it was Tissaphernes\r\nof whom he were jealous and with whom he had a quarrel. There was also a\r\ncertain slowness in the disposition of the king, which was mistaken by\r\nthe people for good nature. At the beginning of his reign, he seemed\r\ninclined to rival the gentleness of his namesake, as he made himself\r\npleasant to all whom he met, distributed honours and favours even beyond\r\nmen's deserts, took no delight in insulting and torturing evil-doers,\r\nand showed himself as affable and courteous to those from whom he\r\nreceived favours as he was to those upon whom he bestowed them. No\r\npresent was so trifling that he did not receive it gladly, but even when\r\na man named Onisus brought him a pomegranate of unusual size, he said,\r\n\"By Mithras, if this man were given the charge of a small city he would\r\nsoon make it great!\"\r\n\r\nV. When during one of his journeys all men were bringing him presents, a\r\nlabouring man, not finding anything else to give, ran to the river, took\r\nup some of the water in his two hands and offered it to him. Artaxerxes\r\nwas pleased with the man, and sent him a gold drinking-cup and a\r\nthousand darics. When Eukleidas the Lacedæmonian had spoken his mind\r\nvery freely to him, he bade his general say to him, \"You may say what\r\nyou please, but I may both say and do what I please.\" Once when they\r\nwere hunting, Teribazus pointed out to him that his coat was torn.\r\nArtaxerxes asked what was to be done, to which Teribazus answered, \"Put\r\non another coat, and give this one to me.\" He replied, \"I will give it\r\nto you, Teribazus, but I forbid you to wear it.\" Teribazus, however, who\r\nwas a loyal subject, but careless and flighty, immediately put on the\r\ncoat, and ornamented himself with women's necklaces belonging to the\r\nking, so that all men were disgusted with him, for it was not lawful to\r\ndo so. The king, however, laughed, and said, \"I allow you to wear the\r\njewelry as a woman, and the coat as a fool.\" Though no one eats at the\r\nsame table with the king of Persia except his mother, who sits above\r\nhim, or his wedded wife, who sits below him, Artaxerxes invited his\r\nyounger brothers also, Ostanes and Oxathres, to sit at the same table.\r\nOne of the sights which especially delighted the Persians was the\r\ncarriage in which Statira, the wife of Artaxerxes, drove, with the\r\ncurtains drawn back, for the queen allowed the people to greet her and\r\napproach her, and was much beloved by them in consequence.\r\n\r\nVI. However, all turbulent and unsettled spirits thought that the empire\r\nrequired Cyrus at its head, since he was a brilliant and warlike prince,\r\na staunch friend to his comrades, and a man of intellect and ambition,\r\ncapable of wielding the enormous power of Persia. Cyrus, when he began\r\nthe war, relied upon the attachment of the people of the interior of\r\nAsia as much as he did upon that of his own followers; and he wrote to\r\nthe Lacedæmonians, begging them to help him and to send soldiers to him,\r\ndeclaring that if the soldiers came to him on foot, he would give them\r\nhorses, and if they came on horseback, he would give them carriages and\r\npairs, that if they possessed fields, he would give them villages, and\r\nif they possessed villages he would give them cities; and that his\r\nsoldiers' pay should be given them by measure, instead of being counted\r\nout to them. At the same time he boasted loudly about himself, averring\r\nthat he had a greater heart than his brother, was a better philosopher,\r\nand was a more learned Magian, and also that he could drink and carry\r\nmore wine than his brother, who, he declared, was so lazy and cowardly\r\nthat he would not even mount a horse when hunting, or a throne in time\r\nof peril. The Lacedæmonians now sent a skytale[581] to Klearchus,\r\nbidding him obey the bidding of Cyrus in all things. Cyrus marched\r\nagainst the King of Persia with a large force and nearly thirteen\r\nthousand Greek mercenary troops, whom he had engaged upon various\r\npretences. His treason was not long undiscovered, for Tissaphernes went\r\nin person to tell the king of it, upon which there was a terrible scene\r\nof disorder in the palace, since Parysatis was blamed as being the chief\r\ninstigator of the war, and her friends were all viewed with suspicion as\r\ntraitors. Parysatis was especially enraged by the reproaches of Statira,\r\nwho asked her loudly, \"Where now are the pledges you gave us? What has\r\ncome of the entreaties by which you begged off Cyrus when he plotted\r\nagainst his brother's life, now that you have plunged us into war and\r\nmisery?\" In consequence of these reproaches Parysatis conceived a\r\nvehement hatred for Statira, and being of a fierce passionate\r\nunforgiving temper, she plotted her destruction. Deinon states that she\r\neffected her purpose during the war, but Ktesias says that she did the\r\ndeed afterwards, and I shall adopt his account of the matter, for it is\r\nnot probable that he, who was an eye-witness of these events, did not\r\nknow the order in which they took place, or that in his history he\r\nshould have had any reason for misrepresenting them, although he often\r\ndeparts from the exact truth with a view to dramatic effect.\r\n\r\nVII. As Cyrus marched onwards, many rumours and reports were brought to\r\nhim, that the king had determined not to fight at once, and was not\r\nanxious to meet him in battle, but that he intended to remain in Persia\r\nuntil his forces had assembled there from all parts of the empire.\r\nIndeed, although he had dug a trench across the plain ten fathoms wide,\r\nas many deep, and four hundred stadia long, yet he remained quiet and\r\npermitted Cyrus to cross it, and to march close to Babylon itself.\r\nTeribazus, we are told, was the first who ventured to tell the king that\r\nhe ought not to avoid a battle, and retreat from Media and from Babylon,\r\nand even from Susa itself into Persia, when he possessed an army many\r\ntimes as great as that of the enemy, and numberless satraps and generals\r\nwho were better generals and better soldiers than Cyrus. Upon hearing\r\nthis advice, the king determined to fight as soon as possible. At first\r\nhis sudden appearance with a splendidly equipped force of nine hundred\r\nthousand men caused great surprise and confusion among the rebels, who\r\nhad gained such confidence that they were marching without their arms;\r\nand it was not without much shouting and disorder that Cyrus was able to\r\nrally them and place them in array. The king moved forward slowly and in\r\nsilence, so that the Greeks were filled with admiration at the\r\ndiscipline of his army, for they had expected that in such a host there\r\nwould be disorderly shouts and irregularity and intervals in the line.\r\nThe strongest of the scythed chariots were judiciously posted by\r\nArtaxerxes in front of his line, in order that before the two armies\r\nengaged hand to hand they might break the enemy's ranks by the force of\r\ntheir charge.\r\n\r\nVIII. The battle[582] has been described by many writers, and as\r\nXenophon's narrative is so clear that the reader seems almost to be\r\npresent, and to see the different events in the act of taking place, it\r\nwould be folly for me to do more than to mention some important\r\nparticulars which he has omitted. The place where the two armies met is\r\ncalled Kunaxa, and is five hundred stadia distant from Babylon. Before\r\nthe battle Klearchus is said to have advised Cyrus to post himself\r\nbehind the ranks of the soldiers, and not to risk his life; to which\r\nCyrus replied \"What say you, Klearchus? Just when I am striving to win a\r\nkingdom, do you bid me prove myself unworthy of one?\" In the action\r\nitself, though Cyrus made a great mistake in plunging so rashly into the\r\nmidst of the enemy without regarding the risk that he ran, yet Klearchus\r\nwas quite as much, if not more to blame for not arraying his Greeks\r\nopposite to the Persian king, and for resting his right wing upon the\r\nriver for fear he should be surrounded. If he valued safety more than\r\nanything else, and cared only to avoid the slightest risk of loss, he\r\nhad better have stayed at home; but after he had marched ten thousand\r\nstadia from the sea, under no compulsion, but solely in order to place\r\nCyrus upon the throne of Persia, then to be solicitous, not for a post\r\nwhere he might win the victory for his chief and paymaster, but merely\r\nfor one where he might fight without exposing himself, was to act like a\r\nman who, on the first appearance of danger, abandons the whole\r\nenterprise and gives up the object for which the expedition was made. It\r\nis abundantly clear from what took place, that if the Greeks had charged\r\nthe troops who defended the king's person, they would have met with no\r\nresistance, and if these men had been routed, and the king slain or\r\nforced to take flight, Cyrus's victory would at once have placed him on\r\nthe throne. It was, therefore, the overcaution of Klearchus more than\r\nthe rashness of Cyrus which really caused the death of the latter and\r\nthe ruin of his cause; for the Persian King himself could not, if he had\r\nwished, have placed the Greeks in a position where they could do him\r\nless harm, for they were so far away from him and his main body that he\r\ndid not even perceive that they had routed their antagonists, and Cyrus\r\nwas slain before Klearchus could reap any advantage from his victory.\r\nYet Cyrus knew what was best, for he ordered Klearchus to post his men\r\nin the centre; but Klearchus, saying that he would manage as well as he\r\ncould, ruined everything.\r\n\r\nIX. The Greeks put the Persians to flight with the greatest ease, and\r\npursued them for a long distance. Cyrus, as he rode forward, mounted\r\nupon a spirited, but hard-mouthed and unmanageable horse, which, we\r\nlearn from Ktesias was named Pasakas, was met by Artagerses, the leader\r\nof the Kadousians, who shouted loudly, saying, \"Most wicked and foolish\r\nof men, who hast disgraced the name of Cyrus, erst the noblest in\r\nPersia, and bringest thy base Greeks on a base errand, to plunder the\r\ngood things of the Persians, and to slay thy brother and thy lord, who\r\nhath ten thousand times ten thousand slaves, each one better than thou\r\nart. Soon shalt thou find out the truth of this; for before thou seest\r\nthe king's face thou shalt lose thine own head.\" Saying thus, he hurled\r\nhis javelin against Cyrus, but his breastplate resisted the blow, and\r\nCyrus was not wounded, although he reeled in his saddle from the\r\nviolence of the stroke. As Artagerses wheeled round his horse, Cyrus\r\nstruck him with a javelin, driving the point through his throat, beside\r\nthe collar-bone. That Artagerses was slain by Cyrus nearly all\r\nhistorians agree, but as to the death of Cyrus himself, since Xenophon\r\nhas described it very shortly, as he was not an eye-witness of it, we\r\nmay as well give the accounts of it which Deinon and which Ktesias have\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nX. Deinon says that when Artagerses fell, Cyrus charged violently among\r\nthe troops round the king, and wounded the king's horse. Artaxerxes was\r\nthrown from his horse, but Teribazus quickly mounted him upon another\r\nhorse, saying, \"My king, remember this day, for you ought not to forget\r\nit.\" Artaxerxes, he states, was again thrown from his horse by the\r\nvehement onset of Cyrus, and again mounted. At the third charge the king\r\nwho was violently enraged, and cried out to those around him that it was\r\nbetter to die than be treated thus, rode straight against Cyrus, who\r\nrashly and heedlessly exposed himself to the missiles of his enemies.\r\nThe king hurled a dart at Cyrus, and so did all his followers. Cyrus\r\nfell, struck, some say by the king himself, but according to others he\r\nwas slain by a Carian soldier, on whom the king afterwards, as a reward\r\nfor this feat of arms, bestowed the honour of marching at the head of\r\nthe army, carrying a golden cock upon a spear. Indeed the Persians call\r\nthe Carians themselves cocks, because of the plumes with which they\r\nornament their helmets.\r\n\r\nXI. The story of Ktesias, reduced to a succinct form, is as\r\nfollows:--Cyrus, after slaying Artagerses, rode towards the king himself,\r\nand the king rode towards him, both of them in silence. Ariaeus, the\r\nfriend of Cyrus, struck the king first but did not wound him. The king\r\nhurled his spear and missed Cyrus, but struck Satiphernes, a man of\r\nnoble birth and a trusted friend of Cyrus, and slew him. Cyrus hurled\r\nhis javelin at the king, drove it through his breastplate, making a\r\nwound in his breast two fingers' breadths deep, and cast him from his\r\nhorse. Upon this there was much disorder, and many took to flight. The\r\nking rose, and with a few followers, among whom was Ktesias, took\r\nrefuge on a hill hard by. Meanwhile Cyrus was carried by his horse a\r\nlong distance forward into the midst of his enemies, and, as it was now\r\ngrowing dark, he was not recognised by his foes, and was being sought\r\nfor in vain by his friends. Excited by his victory, and full of spirit\r\nand pride, he rode about through the ranks, crying, \"Out of my way,\r\nwretches.\" As Cyrus shouted these words in Persian, some made way for\r\nhim, but the tiara fell from his head, and a young man named\r\nMithridates, not knowing who he was, hurled a javelin and struck him on\r\nthe temple near the eye. The wound bled profusely, and Cyrus became\r\ndizzy and faint, so that he fell from his horse. The horse rushed away\r\nfrom him and was lost, but the servant of the man who struck Cyrus took\r\nup his saddle-cloth, which fell from his horse, and which was drenched\r\nwith blood.\r\n\r\nWhen Cyrus began to recover from the effects of this blow, some few of\r\nhis eunuchs tried to mount him upon another horse and get him safe away\r\nfrom the field. As, however, he could not mount, he proposed to walk,\r\nand the eunuchs supported him as he went, faint and weak in his body,\r\nbut still imagining himself to be the victor as he heard the fugitives\r\ncalling Cyrus their king and begging him for mercy. At this time certain\r\nmen of Kaunus, of mean and low condition, who followed the king's army\r\nto perform menial services, happened to join the party with Cyrus,\r\nsupposing them to be friends. When, however, they managed to distinguish\r\nthat the surcoats which they wore over their armour were purple, while\r\nall the king's soldiers wore white ones, they perceived that they were\r\nenemies. One of them ventured to strike Cyrus from behind with a spear,\r\nnot knowing who he was. The javelin struck Cyrus behind the knee,\r\ncutting the vein there, and in his fall he also struck his wounded\r\ntemple against a stone, and so died. This is the story of Ktesias, in\r\nwhich he seems, as it were, to hack poor Cyrus to death with a blunt\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nXII. When Cyrus was dead it happened that Artasyras, who was called the\r\nking's eye,[583] rode past. Recognising the eunuchs who were mourning\r\nover the body, he asked the most trusted of them, \"Pariskas, who is this\r\nbeside whom you sit weeping?\" He answered, \"Artasyras, do you not see\r\nthat it is Cyrus, who is dead?\" Artasyras was astonished at this news,\r\nbade the eunuch be of good courage and guard the body, and himself rode\r\nin haste to Artaxerxes, who had given up all hope of success, and was in\r\ngreat bodily suffering from his wound and from thirst. Artasyras, with\r\ngreat delight, told him that he had seen Cyrus lying dead. On hearing\r\nthis Artaxerxes at first wished to go to see it himself, and bade\r\nArtasyras lead him to the spot; but as there was much talk and fear of\r\nthe Greeks, who were said to be advancing and carrying all before them;\r\nhe decided to send a party to view the body; and thirty men went\r\ncarrying torches. Meanwhile, as the king himself was almost dying of\r\nthirst the eunuch Satibarzanes went in search of drink for him; for\r\nthere was no water in the place where he was, nor indeed anywhere near\r\nthe army. After much trouble the eunuch at length fell in with one of\r\nthe low Kaunian camp followers, who had about four pints of putrid water\r\nin a skin, which he took from the man and carried it to the king. When\r\nthe king had drunk it all, he asked him if he was not disgusted with the\r\nwater; and the king swore by the gods that he never had drank either\r\nwine or the purest of water with such pleasure. \"So,\" added he, \"if I be\r\nnot able to find the man who gave you this water and reward him for it,\r\nI pray that the gods may make him rich and happy.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. While they were talking thus, the thirty men rode up in high\r\nspirits, announcing to him his unlooked-for good fortune. Artaxerxes now\r\nbegan to recover his courage from the number of men who began to\r\nassemble round him, and descended from the hill amidst the glare of many\r\ntorches. When he reached the body, the head and right hand were cut off,\r\nin accordance with some Persian custom. He ordered the head to be\r\nbrought to him, took hold of it by the long thick hair, and showed it to\r\nthose who were still wavering or fleeing. They all were filled with\r\namazement, and did homage to him, so that he soon collected a force of\r\nseventy thousand men, accompanied by whom he re-entered his camp. He had\r\nleft it in the morning, according to Ktesias, with an army of four\r\nhundred thousand men; though Deinon and Xenophon both estimate the\r\nforces actually engaged at a higher figure. Ktesias states that the\r\nnumber of the dead was returned to Artaxerxes as nine thousand, but that\r\nhe himself thought that the corpses which he saw lying on the field must\r\namount to more than twenty thousand. This point admits of discussion;\r\nbut Ktesias tells an obvious untruth when he says that he was sent on an\r\nembassy to the Greeks, together with Phalinus of Zakynthus, and some\r\nother persons. Xenophon knew that Ktesias was at the king's court, for\r\nhe makes mention of him, and has evidently read his history; so that he\r\nnever would have passed him over, and only mentioned Phalinus of\r\nZakynthus, if Ktesias had really come as interpreter on a mission of\r\nsuch importance. But Ktesias, being a wonderfully vain man, and\r\nespecially attached to the Lacedæmonians and to Klearchus, constantly in\r\nhis history introduces himself, while he sings the praises of Lacedæmon\r\nand of Klearchus.\r\n\r\nXIV. After the battle, Artaxerxes sent most splendid and valuable\r\npresents to Artagerses, the son of the man who had been slain by Cyrus,\r\nand handsomely rewarded Ktesias and the rest of his companions. He\r\nsought out the Kaunian from whom he had received the water-skin, who was\r\na poor and humble man, and made him rich and honoured. He also took\r\npains to appoint suitable punishments to those who had misconducted\r\nthemselves. One Arbakes, a Mede, deserted to Cyrus during the battle,\r\nand when Cyrus fell again returned to his allegiance. Artaxerxes,\r\nperceiving that he had done so not from treachery but from sheer\r\ncowardice, ordered him to carry a naked courtesan about the market-place\r\nupon his shoulders for the whole of one day. Another deserter, who\r\nbesides changing sides falsely boasted that he had slain two of the\r\nenemy, was condemned by the king to have his tongue pierced with three\r\nneedles. As Artaxerxes believed, and wished all men to think that he had\r\nhimself slain Cyrus, he sent presents to Mithridates, who was the first\r\nman that wounded Cyrus, and bade those who carried the presents say,\r\n\"The king honours you with these presents, because you found Cyrus's\r\nsaddle-cloth and brought it to him.\" And when the Carian, who had\r\nstruck Cyrus under the knee, demanded a present, he bade those who\r\ncarried the presents say, \"The king gives you these for having been\r\nsecond to bring him the good news; for Artasyras first, and you next,\r\nbrought him the news of the death of Cyrus.\" Mithridates retired in\r\nsilence, much vexed at this; but the unhappy Carian, as often happens,\r\nwas ruined by his own folly. Excited by his good fortune into trying to\r\nobtain more than became him, he refused to take what was offered him for\r\nhaving brought good news, but remonstrated loudly, declaring that he,\r\nand no one else, slew Cyrus, and that he was most unjustly being\r\ndeprived of the credit of the action. The king, when he heard this, was\r\ngreatly angered, and ordered the man's head to be struck off. His\r\nmother, Parysatis, who was present, said, \"My king, do not thus rid\r\nyourself of this pestilent Carian. He shall receive from me a fitting\r\npunishment for what he has dared to say.\" The king handed him over to\r\nher, and Parysatis ordered the executioners to torture him for ten days,\r\nand then to tear out his eyes and pour molten copper into his ears until\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nXV. Mithridates also came to an evil end after a few days by his folly.\r\nHe came dressed in the robe, and adorned with the ornaments which he had\r\nreceived from the king, to a banquet at which the eunuchs of the king\r\nand of the king's mother were present. When they began to drink the most\r\ninfluential of the eunuchs of Parysatis said to him: \"What a fine dress,\r\nMithridates, and what fine necklaces and bracelet the king has given\r\nyou! How valuable is your scimitar? Indeed, he has made you fortunate\r\nand envied by all men.\" Mithridates, who was already in liquor,\r\nanswered: \"What are these things, Sparamixes? I proved myself on that\r\nday worth more than these to the king.\" Sparamixes smiled and said, \"I\r\ndo not grudge you them, Mithridates, but come--as the Greeks say that\r\nthere is truth in wine--tell us how it can be so great or brilliant an\r\nachievement to find a saddle-cloth that has fallen off a horse, and to\r\nbring it to the king.\" This the eunuch said, not because he did not know\r\nthe truth, but because he wished to lead Mithridates, whose tongue was\r\nloosened by wine, to expose his folly before the company. Mithridates\r\ncould not restrain himself, and said: \"You may say what you please\r\nabout saddle-cloths and such nonsense; I tell you plainly, that it was\r\nby my hand that Cyrus fell. I did not hurl my javelin in vain, like\r\nArtagerses, but I just missed his eye, struck him through the temple,\r\nand felled him to the ground; and with that blow he died.\" All the rest\r\nof the guests, foreseeing the miserable end to which Mithridates would\r\ncertainly come, cast their eyes upon the ground; but the host said: \"My\r\ngood Mithridates, let us now eat and drink, adoring the fortune of the\r\nking, but let us not talk about subjects which are too high for us.\"\r\n\r\nXVI. After this, the eunuch told Parysatis what Mithridates had said,\r\nand she told the king, who was much enraged, because he was proved not\r\nto have spoken the truth, and had been deprived of the sweetest part of\r\nhis victory; for he wished to persuade all men, Asiatics and Greeks\r\nalike, that in the skirmish when he and his brother met he himself had\r\nbeen wounded by Cyrus, but had struck him dead. He therefore condemned\r\nMithridates to the punishment of the boat. This is as follows:--Two\r\nwooden boats are made, which fit together. The criminal is placed on his\r\nback in one of them, and then the other is placed over him, and the two\r\nare fastened so as to leave his head, feet, and hands outside, but\r\ncovering all the rest of his body. They give him food, and if he refuses\r\nit, they force him to eat it by pricking his eyes. When he has eaten\r\nthey pour a mixture of milk and honey into his mouth and over his face.\r\nThey then keep turning his eyes towards the sun, his whole face becomes\r\ncompletely covered with flies. As all his evacuations are necessarily\r\ncontained within the boat, worms and maggots are generated from the\r\ncorruption, which eat into his body; for when the man is certainly dead,\r\nthey take off the upper boat and find all his flesh eaten away, and\r\nswarms of these animals clinging to his bowels and devouring them. In\r\nthis way Mithridates died, after enduring his misery for seventeen days.\r\n\r\nXVII. The only remaining object of the vengeance of Parysatis was\r\nMasabates, the king's eunuch who cut off the head and hand of Cyrus. As\r\nhe gave no handle against himself, Parysatis devised the following plot\r\nagainst him. She was naturally a clever woman, and was fond of playing\r\nwith the dice. Before the war, she had often played with dice with the\r\nking; and after the war when she became reconciled to him she took part\r\nin his amusements, played at games with him, encouraged his amours, and\r\naltogether permitted Statira to have but very little of his society; for\r\nParysatis hated Statira more than any one else, and wished to have most\r\ninfluence with Artaxerxes herself. Finding Artaxerxes one day eager for\r\namusement, as he had nothing to do, she challenged him to play for a\r\nthousand darics. She purposely allowed her son to win, and paid him the\r\nmoney: and then pretending to be vexed at her loss, called on him to\r\ncast the dice afresh for a eunuch. Artaxerxes agreed, and they agreed to\r\nplay upon the condition that each of them should set apart five of their\r\nmost trusty eunuchs, and that the winner was to have his choice of the\r\nrest. On these terms they played; and Parysatis, who gave the closest\r\nattention to her game, and was also favoured by fortune, won, and chose\r\nMasabates, who was not one of the excepted ones. Before the king\r\nsuspected her purpose she had Masabates arrested, and delivered him to\r\nthe executioners with orders to flay him alive, impale his body sideways\r\nupon three stakes, and hang up his skin separately. This was done; and\r\nas the king was greatly grieved at it and was angry with her, she smiled\r\nand said ironically: \"How pleasant and well-mannered you are, to be\r\nangry about a miserable old eunuch, whereas I have lost a thousand\r\ndarics at dice and say nothing about it.\" The king, though he was sorry\r\nto have been so cheated, yet remained quiet; but Statira, who indeed\r\noften on other occasions openly braved Parysatis, was very indignant\r\nwith her for so cruelly and unjustly putting the king's faithful eunuch\r\nto death for Cyrus's sake.\r\n\r\nXVIII. When Tissaphernes betrayed Klearchus and the other generals,\r\nbroke his plighted word, seized them and sent them away in chains,\r\nKtesias tells us that Klearchus asked him to provide him with a comb.\r\nWhen Klearchus received it and combed his hair with it, he was so much\r\npleased that he gave Ktesias his ring, to be a token to all Klearchus's\r\nfriends and relatives in Lacedæmon of his friendship for Ktesias. The\r\ndevice engraved upon the ring was a dance of Karyatides. At first the\r\nsoldiers who were imprisoned with Klearchus took away the provisions\r\nwhich were sent to him and ate them themselves, giving him but a small\r\npart of them. Ktesias says that he remedied this also, by arranging that\r\na larger portion should be sent to Klearchus, and that a separate\r\nallowance should be given to the soldiers. All these services Ktesias\r\nstates that he rendered in consequence of the favour of Parysatis for\r\nthe captives, and at her instigation. He says, also, that as he sent\r\nKlearchus a joint of meat daily in addition to his other provisions,\r\nKlearchus begged him and assured him that it was his duty to hide a\r\nsmall dagger in the meat, and send it to him, and not to allow him to be\r\ncruelly put to death by the king; but he was afraid, and did not dare to\r\ndo it. Ktesias says that the king's mother pleaded with him for the life\r\nof Klearchus, and that he agreed to spare him, and even swore to do so,\r\nbut that he was again overruled by Statira, and put them all to death\r\nexcept Menon. It was in consequence of this, according to Ktesias, that\r\nParysatis began to plot against Statira, and devised the plan for\r\npoisoning her, though it seems very unlikely that it was only for the\r\nsake of Klearchus that she dared to do such wickedness as to murder the\r\nlawful wife of her king, who was the mother of the heirs to the throne.\r\nBut clearly all this was written merely for dramatic effect, to do\r\nhonour to the memory of Klearchus. Ktesias writes, too, that when the\r\ngenerals were put to death the remains of the others were thrown away to\r\nbe devoured by the dogs and fowls of the air; but that a violent storm\r\nof wind heaped much earth over the body of Klearchus, and that from some\r\ndates which were scattered around there soon sprung up a fair and shady\r\ngrove above the place where he lay, so that the king sorely repented of\r\nwhat he had done, thinking that in Klearchus he had slain one who was a\r\nfavourite of the gods.\r\n\r\nXIX. Parysatis, who had long been jealous of Statira and hated her, and\r\nwho saw that her own power depended merely on the respect with which she\r\nwas regarded by the king, who loved and trusted Statira, now determined\r\nto destroy her, though at the most terrible risk to herself. She had a\r\nfaithful maid-servant, named Gigis, who was high in her favour, whom\r\nDeinon accuses of having assisted to administer the poison, though\r\nKtesias says that she was only privy to the plot, and that against her\r\nwill. Ktesias says that the man who procured the poison was named\r\nBelitaris, but Deinon calls him Melantas. Now the two queens, leaving\r\noff their former hatred and suspicion, began again to visit one another\r\nand to dine together, but yet mistrusted each other so much that they\r\nonly ate the same food from the same dishes. There is in Persia a small\r\nbird, which has no excrements, but all its entrails are filled with\r\nsolid fat; it is supposed that it feeds upon air and dew; the name of it\r\nis _rhyntakes_. Ktesias states that Parysatis cut this bird in two with\r\na small knife, one side of which was smeared over with the poison. As\r\nshe cut it, she wiped the poison off the blade on to one piece of the\r\nbird, which she gave to Statira, while she ate the untouched portion\r\nherself. Deinon, however, says that it was not Parysatis, but Melantas,\r\nwho cut off the poisoned part of the meat and gave it to Statira. As\r\nStatira perished in dreadful agonies and convulsions, she herself\r\nperceived that she had been poisoned, and directed the suspicions of the\r\nking against his mother, knowing, as he did, her fierce and rancorous\r\ndisposition. He at once began to search for the author of the crime,\r\nseized all his mother's servants and the attendants at her table, and\r\nput them to the torture, except Gigis, whom Parysatis kept for a long\r\ntime at home with herself, and refused to deliver up, though afterwards,\r\nwhen Gigis begged to be sent to her own home, the king heard of it, laid\r\nan ambuscade, caught her, and condemned her to death. Poisoners are put\r\nto death in Persia in the following manner: their heads are placed upon\r\na flat stone, and are then beaten with another stone until the face and\r\nskull is crushed. Gigis perished in this manner; but Artaxerxes said and\r\ndid nothing to Parysatis, except that he sent her to Babylon, at her own\r\nrequest, saying that he himself should not see Babylon as long as she\r\nlived. Such were the domestic troubles of Artaxerxes.\r\n\r\nXX. Though the king was as anxious to get the Greek troops, who\r\naccompanied Cyrus, into his power as he had been to conquer Cyrus\r\nhimself and to save his throne, yet he could not do so: for though they\r\nhad lost their leader, Cyrus, and all their generals, yet they got away\r\nsafe after having penetrated almost as far as the king's palace itself,\r\nproving clearly to the world that the Persian empire, in spite of all\r\nits gold and luxury and beautiful women, was mere empty bombast without\r\nany real strength. Upon this all Greece took courage and despised the\r\nAsiatics, while the Lacedæmonians felt that it would be a disgrace to\r\nthem not to set free the enslaved Greeks of Asia Minor, and put a stop\r\nto the insolence of the Persians. Their army was at first commanded by\r\nThimbron, and afterwards by Derkyllidas, but as neither of these\r\neffected anything of importance, they entrusted the conduct of the war\r\nto their king Agesilaus. He crossed over to Asia with the fleet, and at\r\nonce began to act with vigour. He gained much glory, defeated\r\nTissaphernes, and set free the Greek cities from the Persians.\r\nArtaxerxes, upon this, having carefully considered how it would be best\r\nfor him to contend with the Greeks, sent Timokrates of Rhodes into\r\nGreece with a large sum of money, and ordered him to corrupt the most\r\nimportant persons in each city by offering bribes to them, and to stir\r\nup the Greeks to make war against Lacedæmon. Timokrates did so, and as\r\nthe greatest states formed a league, and Peloponnesus was in great\r\nconfusion, the government ordered Agesilaus to return from Asia. On his\r\ndeparture on this occasion he is said to have remarked to his friends\r\nthat he was being driven out of Asia by the King of Persia with thirty\r\nthousand archers; for the Persian coins bear the device of an archer.\r\n\r\nXXI. Artaxerxes also chased the Lacedæmonians from the sea, making use\r\nfor this purpose of Konon, the Athenian, as his admiral in conjunction\r\nwith Pharnabazus. Konon, after the battle of Ægospotami, had retired to\r\nCyprus, where he remained, not so much in order to ensure his own safety\r\nas to watch for a favourable opportunity, as one waits for the turn of\r\nthe tide. Observing that while he possessed skill without power, the\r\nKing of Persia possessed power without an able man to direct it, he\r\nwrote a letter to the king expressing these ideas. He ordered the man\r\nwho carried the letter to make it reach the king, if possible, by the\r\nhands of Zeno the Cretan, or of Polykritus of Mende. Of these men, Zeno\r\nwas a dancer, and Polykritus a physician. If these men should be absent\r\nhe ordered the man to give the letter to Ktesias the physician. It is\r\nsaid that Ktesias received the letter and that he added to what Konon\r\nhad written a paragraph bidding the king send Ktesias to him, as he\r\nwould be a useful person to superintend naval operations. Ktesias,\r\nhowever, says that the king of his own accord appointed him to this\r\nservice. Artaxerxes, now, by means of Pharnabazus and Konon, gained the\r\nsea-fight of Knidos, deprived the Lacedæmonians of the empire of the\r\nsea, and established so great an ascendancy over the Greeks that he was\r\nable to conclude with them the celebrated peace which was known as the\r\npeace of Antalkidas. This Antalkidas was a Spartan, the son of Leon; and\r\nhe being entirely in the interests of the King of Persia, prevailed upon\r\nthe Lacedæmonians to allow him to possess all the Greek cities in Asia,\r\nand all the islands off the coast, as his subjects and tributaries, as\r\nthe result of the peace, if that can be called a peace, which was really\r\nan insult and betrayal of Greece to the enemy; for no war could have\r\nended more disgracefully for the vanquished.\r\n\r\nXXII. It follows from this that Artaxerxes, who, we learn from Deinon,\r\nalways disliked all other Spartans, and thought them the most insolent\r\nof mankind, when he visited Persia, showed especial favour to\r\nAntalkidas. Once, after dinner, he took a garland of flowers, dipped it\r\nin the most valuable perfume, and sent it to Antalkidas. All men\r\nwondered at this mark of favour; but, it appears, Antalkidas was just\r\nthe man to receive such presents, and to be corrupted by the luxury of\r\nthe Persians, as he did not scruple to disgrace the memory of Leonidas\r\nand Kalikratidas by his conduct among them. When some one said to\r\nAgesilaus, \"Alas for Hellas, when the Lacedæmonians are Medising.\"\r\nAgesilaus answered \"Is it not rather the Medes that are Laconising.\" Yet\r\nthe cleverness of this retort did not take away the disgrace of the\r\ntransaction, for, though the Lacedæmonians lost their empire at the\r\nbattle of Leuktra by their bad generalship, yet the glory of Sparta was\r\nlost before, by that shameful treaty. While Sparta was the leading state\r\nin Greece, Artaxerxes made Antalkidas his guest, and spoke of him as\r\nhis friend; but when after the defeat at Leuktra the Lacedæmonians were\r\nhumbled to the dust, and were in such distress for money that they sent\r\nAgesilaus to Egypt to serve for hire, Antalkidas again came to the court\r\nof Artaxerxes to beg him to help the Lacedæmonians. But Artaxerxes\r\ntreated him with such neglect, and so contemptuously refused his\r\nrequest, that Antalkidas, on his return, jeered at by his enemies, and\r\nafraid moreover of the anger of the Ephors, starved himself to death.\r\nThere went also to the King of Persia Ismenias of Thebes, and Pelopidas\r\nwho had just won the battle of Leuktra. Pelopidas would not disgrace\r\nhimself by any show of servility; but Ismenias, when ordered to do\r\nreverence to the king, dropped his ring, and then stooped to pick it up,\r\nso that he appeared to bow to the earth before him. Artaxerxes was so\r\nmuch pleased with Timagoras of Athens, who gave some secret intelligence\r\nin a letter which he sent by a secretary named Beluris, that he gave him\r\na thousand darics, and, as he was in weak health and required milk sent\r\neighty milch cows to accompany him. He also sent him a bed with\r\nbed-clothes and attendants to make it, as though Greeks did not know\r\nhow, and bearers to carry him in a litter down to the sea-coast, on\r\naccount of his indisposition. When he was at court, also, the king sent\r\nhim a magnificent banquet, so that the king's brother, Ostanes, said to\r\nhim, \"Timagoras, remember this table; for it is not for slight services\r\nthat it is so splendidly set out.\" This he said rather to reproach him\r\nfor his treachery than to remind him to be grateful. However, the\r\nAthenians put Timagoras to death for taking bribes from the king.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Although many of the acts of Artaxerxes grieved the Greeks, yet\r\nthey were delighted with one of them, for he put to death Tissaphernes,\r\ntheir bitterest enemy. This he did in consequence of an intrigue of\r\nParysatis; for Artaxerxes did not long continue angry with his mother,\r\nbut became reconciled with her, and sent for her to his court, as he\r\nfelt that her understanding and spirit would help him to govern, while\r\nthere remained no further causes of variance between them. Henceforth\r\nshe endeavoured in everything to please the king, and gained great\r\ninfluence with him by never opposing any of his wishes. She now\r\nperceived that he was violently enamoured of one of his own daughters,\r\nnamed Atossa, but that, chiefly on his mother's account, he concealed\r\nhis love and restrained himself, though some historians state that he\r\nhad already had some secret commerce with the girl. When Parysatis\r\nsuspected this, she caressed the girl more than ever, and was\r\ncontinually praising her beauty and good qualities to the king, saying\r\nthat she was a noble lady and fit to be a queen. At last she persuaded\r\nhim into marrying the girl and proclaiming her as his lawful wife,\r\ndisregarding the opinions and customs of the Greeks, and declaring that\r\nhe himself was a law to the Persians and able to decide for himself what\r\nwas right and wrong. Some writers, however, amongst whom is Herakleides\r\nof Kyme, state that Artaxerxes, besides Atossa, married another of his\r\ndaughters, named Amestris, of whom I shall shortly afterwards make\r\nmention. Atossa lived with her father as his wife, and was so much\r\nbeloved by him, that when leprosy broke out over her body he was not at\r\nall disgusted with her, but prayed for her to Hera alone of all the\r\ngoddesses, prostrating himself in her temple and grasping the earth with\r\nhis hands, while he ordered his satraps and friends to send so many\r\npresents to the goddess, that all the space between the palace and the\r\ntemple, a distance of sixteen stadia (two English miles) was filled with\r\ngold and silver, and horses, and purple dyed stuffs.\r\n\r\nXXIV. He appointed Pharnabazus and Iphikrates to conduct a war against\r\nEgypt,[584] which failed through the dissensions of the generals; and he\r\nhimself led an army of three hundred thousand foot and ten thousand\r\nhorse against the Kadousians.[585] On this occasion he insensibly placed\r\nhimself in a position of great peril as he entered a difficult and foggy\r\ncountry, which produces no crops that grow from seed, but is inhabited\r\nby a fierce and warlike race of men who feed upon apples, pears, and\r\nother fruits which are found upon trees. No provisions could be found\r\nin this country, nor yet be brought into it from without, and the army\r\nwas reduced to slaughtering the beasts of burden, so that an ass's head\r\nsold for more than sixty drachmas. The king's own table was scantily\r\nfurnished; and but few of the horses remained alive, all the rest having\r\nbeen eaten. At this crisis Teribazus, a man who had often made himself\r\nthe first man in the state by his bravery, and as often fallen into\r\ndisrepute by folly, and who was then in a very humble and despicable\r\nposition, saved both the king and his army. The Kadousians had two\r\nkings, each of whom occupied a separate camp. Teribazus, after having\r\nexplained to Artaxerxes what he was about to do, himself went to one of\r\nthese camps, and sent his son to the other. Each of them deceived the\r\nking to whom he went, by saying that the other king was about to send an\r\nembassy to Artaxerxes, offering to make peace and contract an alliance\r\nwith him for himself alone. \"If, then, you are wise,\" said they, \"you\r\nwill be beforehand with your rival, and I will manage the whole affair\r\nfor you.\" Both of the kings were imposed upon in this manner, and, in\r\ntheir eagerness to steal a march upon one another, one of them sent\r\nambassadors to the Persians with Teribazus, and the other with his son.\r\nAs Teribazus was a long while absent, Artaxerxes began to suspect his\r\nfidelity, and he fell into a very desponding condition, regretting that\r\nhe had trusted Teribazus, and listening to his detractors. When,\r\nhowever, Teribazus arrived, and his son arrived also, each bringing\r\nambassadors from the Kadousians, and a treaty of peace was concluded,\r\nTeribazus became again a great and important personage. In this campaign\r\nArtaxerxes proved that cowardice and effeminacy arise only from a\r\ndepraved disposition and natural meanness of spirit, not, as the vulgar\r\nimagine, from wealth and luxury; for in spite of the splendid dress and\r\nornaments, valued at twelve thousand talents, which he always wore, the\r\nking laboured as hard, and suffered as great privations, as any common\r\nsoldier, never mounting his horse, but always leading the way on foot up\r\nsteep and rugged mountain paths, with his quiver on his shoulder, and\r\nhis shield on his left arm, so that all the rest were inspirited and\r\nencouraged by seeing his eagerness and vigour; for he accomplished every\r\nday a march of upwards of two hundred stadia.\r\n\r\nXXV. When during cold weather the army, encamped in a royal domain,\r\nwhich was full of parks and fine trees, while all the rest of the\r\ncountry was bare and desert, he permitted the soldiers to gather wood\r\nfrom the royal park, and gave them leave to cut down the trees, without\r\nsparing either fir trees or cypresses. As they hesitated, and wished to\r\nspare the trees because of their size and beauty, he himself took an axe\r\nand cut down the largest and finest tree of all. After this they\r\nprovided themselves with wood, lighted many fires, and passed a\r\ncomfortable night.\r\n\r\nOn his return from this campaign he found that he had lost many brave\r\nmen, and almost all his horses. He fancied that he was regarded with\r\ncontempt because of his failure, and began to view all the great men of\r\nthe kingdom with suspicion. Many of them he put to death in anger, but\r\nmore because he feared them--for fear makes kings cruel, while cheerful\r\nconfidence renders them gentle, merciful, and unsuspicious. For this\r\nreason, the beasts that start at the least noise are the most difficult\r\nto tame, while those which are of a more courageous spirit have more\r\nconfidence and do not shrink from men's advances.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Artaxerxes, who was now very old, perceived that his sons were\r\ncaballing with their friends and with the chief nobles of the kingdom to\r\nsecure the succession. The more respectable of these thought that\r\nArtaxerxes ought to leave the crown to his eldest son Darius, as he\r\nhimself had inherited it, but Ochus his younger son, who was of a\r\nvehement and fierce disposition, had a very considerable party, who were\r\nready to support his claims, and hoped to be able to influence his\r\nfather by means of Atossa; for he paid her especial attention, and gave\r\nout that he intended to marry her and make her his queen after his\r\nfather's death. It was even said that he intrigued with her during his\r\nfather's life. Artaxerxes knew nothing of this: but as he wished to cut\r\noff the hopes of Ochus at once, for fear that he might do as Cyrus had\r\ndone, and again plunge the kingdom in wars and disorders, he proclaimed\r\nDarius his heir, and allowed him to wear his tiara erect. There is a\r\ncustom among the Persians that whoever is declared heir to the throne\r\nmay ask for anything that he pleases, and that the king who has\r\nnominated him must, if possible, grant his request. Darius, in\r\naccordance with this custom, asked for Aspasia, the favourite of Cyrus,\r\nwho was at that time living in the harem of Artaxerxes. This lady was a\r\nnative of the city of Phokæa in Ionia, born of free parents, and\r\nrespectably brought up. When she was introduced to Cyrus at supper, with\r\nseveral other women, the others sat down beside him, permitted him to\r\ntouch them and sport with them, and were not offended at his\r\nfamiliarities, but she stood in silence near the couch on which Cyrus\r\nreclined, and refused to come to him when he called her. When his\r\nchamberlains approached her, meaning to bring her to him by force, she\r\nsaid, \"Whoever lays hands on me shall smart for it.\" The company thought\r\nher very rude and ill-mannered, but Cyrus was pleased with her spirits,\r\nand said, with a smile, to the man who had brought her, \"Do you not see\r\nthat this is the only ladylike and respectable one of them all.\" After\r\nthis he became much attached to her, loved her above all other women,\r\nand used to call her \"Aspasia the wise.\" When Cyrus fell and his camp\r\nwas plundered she was taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nXXVII. Now, Darius vexed his father by asking for this lady; for the\r\nPersians are excessively jealous about their women; indeed, not only all\r\nwho approach and speak to one of the king's concubines, but even any one\r\nwho drives past or crosses their litters on the high road, is punished\r\nwith death. Yet, Artaxerxes, through sheer passion, had made Atossa his\r\nwife, and kept three hundred most beautiful concubines. However, when\r\nDarius made this request, he replied that Aspasia was a free woman, and\r\nsaid that if she was willing he might take her, but that he would not\r\nforce her to go against her will. When she was sent for, as she,\r\ncontrary to the king's expectation, chose to go to Darius, the king let\r\nher go, for the law compelled him to do so, but he soon afterwards took\r\nher away from him again: for he appointed her priestess of the temple\r\nof Artemis, called Anäitis, at Ekbatana, in order that she might spend\r\nthe rest of her life in chastity. This he considered to be not a harsh,\r\nbut rather a playful way of reproving his son; but Darius was much\r\nenraged at it, either because he was so deeply enamoured of Aspasia, or\r\nbecause he thought that he was being wantonly insulted by his father.\r\nTeribazus, perceiving his anger, confirmed him in it, because he saw in\r\nthe treatment which Darius had received the counterpart of that which\r\nhad befallen himself. The king, who had several daughters, promised\r\nApama to Pharnabazus, Rhodogoune to Orontes, and Amestris to Teribazus.\r\nHe kept his word with the two former, but broke it to Teribazus by\r\nmarrying Amestris himself, and betrothing his youngest daughter Atossa\r\nto him in her stead. When, as has been related, he fell in love with her\r\nalso and married her, Teribazus became bitterly enraged against him,\r\nbeing of an unstable and fickle disposition, without any steady\r\nprinciples. For this reason he never could bear either bad or good\r\nfortune, but at one time he was honoured as one of the greatest men in\r\nthe kingdom, and then swaggered insufferably, while when he was\r\ndisgraced and reduced to poverty he could not bear his reverse of\r\nfortune with a good grace, but became insolent and offensive.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. It may be imagined that the company of Teribazus was to Darius\r\nas fuel to fire, for Teribazus was constantly repeating to him that it\r\nwas of no use for him to wear his tiara upright if he did not mean to\r\nadvance his own interests, and that he was a fool if he imagined that he\r\ncould inherit the crown without a struggle when his brother was bringing\r\nfemale influence to bear to secure his own succession, and when his\r\nfather was in such a vacillating and uncertain frame of mind. He who\r\ncould break the laws of the Persians--which may not be broken--out of his\r\npassion for a Greek girl, cannot be urged, be trusted, to keep the most\r\nimportant engagements. It was, moreover, a very different thing for\r\nOchus not to obtain the crown, and for him to be deprived of it, for\r\nthere was no reason why Ochus should not live happily in a private\r\nstation, whereas he, having been appointed heir to the throne, must\r\neither become king or perish.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, perhaps we may say with Sophocles, \"Swift runneth\r\nevil counsel to its goal,\" for men find the path smooth and easy towards\r\nwhat they desire, and most men desire what is wrong, because of their\r\nignorance and low mindedness. Yet, besides all these considerations, the\r\ngreatness of the empire, and the fear with which Ochus inspired Darius,\r\nalso afforded arguments to Teribazus. Nor was the goddess of Love\r\nentirely blameless in the matter, for Darius was already incensed at the\r\nloss of Aspasia.\r\n\r\nXXIX. He, therefore, placed himself entirely in the hands of Teribazus;\r\nand many joined in their conspiracy. But the plot was betrayed to the\r\nking by a eunuch, who had a perfect knowledge of their plans, and knew\r\nthat they had determined to break into the king's chamber by night and\r\nmurder him in his bed. When Artaxerxes heard this he was perplexed; for\r\nhe felt that it would be wrong for him to neglect the information which\r\nhe had received of so great a danger, and yet that it would be even\r\nworse to believe the eunuch's story without any proofs of its truth. He\r\ntherefore ordered the eunuch to join the conspirators, and to enter his\r\nchamber with them. Meanwhile he had a door made in the wall behind his\r\nbed, and concealed it with tapestry. When the appointed time arrived, of\r\nwhich he was warned by the eunuch, he lay upon his bed, and did not rise\r\nbefore he had seen the faces of the conspirators and clearly recognised\r\neach of them. But when he saw them draw their daggers and rush upon him,\r\nhe quickly raised the tapestry, passed into the inner room, and slammed\r\nthe door, crying aloud for help. The would-be murderers, having been\r\nseen by the king, but having effected nothing, rushed away through the\r\ngates of the palace, and especially warned Teribazus to fly, as he had\r\nbeen distinctly seen. The others dispersed and escaped, but Teribazus\r\nwas surrounded, and after killing many of the king's body guard with his\r\nown hand was at last despatched by a javelin hurled from a distance.\r\nDarius and his children were brought before a court formed of the royal\r\njudges, who were appointed by the king to try him. As the king himself\r\ndid not appear but impeached him by proxy, he ordered clerks to write\r\ndown the decision of each judge and to bring it to him. As all decided\r\nalike, and sentenced Darius to death, the officers of the court removed\r\nhim into a prison hard by. The executioner now came, bearing in his hand\r\nthe razor, with which the heads of criminals are cut off, but when he\r\nsaw Darius he was dismayed, and ran back to the door with his face\r\naverted, declaring that he could not and dared not lay hands upon his\r\nking. As, however, he was met outside by the judges, who threatened him\r\nand ordered him to do his duty, he returned, took hold of Darius's hair\r\nwith his left hand, dragged down his head, and severed his neck with the\r\nrazor. Some historians state that the king himself was present at the\r\ntrial, and that Darius, when proved guilty, fell on his face and begged\r\nfor mercy: at which the king sprung up in anger, drew his dagger, and\r\nstabbed him mortally. They add that Artaxerxes, after he had returned to\r\nhis palace, came forward publicly, did obeisance to the sun, and then\r\nsaid aloud, \"Men of Persia, be of good cheer, and go, tell the rest of\r\nmy subjects that the great Oromasdes has executed judgment upon those\r\nwho formed a wicked and treasonable plot.\"\r\n\r\nXXX. This was the end of the conspiracy; and now Ochus was encouraged by\r\nAtossa to form high hopes, though he still feared his remaining\r\nlegitimate brother Ariaspes, and his natural brother Arsames. The\r\nPersians wished Ariaspes to be their king, not because he was older than\r\nOchus, but because he was of a gentle and kind disposition; while Ochus\r\nobserved that Arsames was of a keen intellect, and was especially\r\nbeloved by his father. He, therefore, plotted against both of them, and\r\nas he was by nature both crafty and cruel, he indulged his cruelty in\r\nhis treatment of Arsames, while he made use of his cunning to ruin\r\nAriaspes. He kept sending to this latter eunuchs and friends of the\r\nking, who, with an affection of secrecy, continually told him frightful\r\ntales of how his father had determined to put him to death with every\r\ncircumstance of cruelty and insult. These messengers, by daily\r\ncommunicating these fabrications to him, saying that the king was on the\r\nvery eve of carrying them into operation, threw the unhappy man into\r\nsuch a terrible state of despair and excitement of mind that he ended\r\nhis life by poison. The king, on hearing of the manner of his death,\r\nlamented for him, and had some suspicions about how he came by his end;\r\nbut as he was unable to verify them and discover the truth, on account\r\nof his great age, he attached himself all the more warmly to Arsames, so\r\nthat he was well known to trust and confide in him above all others.\r\nYet, Ochus was not discouraged by this, but finding a suitable\r\ninstrument in Arpates the son of Teribazus, induced him to assassinate\r\nArsames. Artaxerxes, when this happened, was so old that his life hung\r\nby a mere thread; and when this last blow fell, he could bear up no\r\nlonger, but sunk at once through grief and misery. He lived ninety-four\r\nyears, and reigned sixty-two, and was thought to be a mild prince, and a\r\nlover of his subjects, though this was chiefly because of his successor,\r\nOchus, who was the most savage and cruel tyrant that ever ruled in\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF ARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. It seems to me, my Polykrates, that it was in order to avoid the\r\nill-omened sound of the old proverb, that the philosopher Chrysippus\r\naltered it into what he thought a better version:\r\n\r\n   \"Who vaunt their fathers, save the best of sons?\"\r\n\r\nbut Dionysodorus of Troezene proves him to be wrong, and restores the\r\nproverb to its original form:\r\n\r\n   \"Who vaunt their fathers, save the worst of sons?\"\r\n\r\nand explains that the proverb was intended to apply to those who are\r\nutterly worthless in themselves, but who shelter their own evil lives\r\nbehind the virtues of their ancestors, and who pride themselves on their\r\nancestors' glory as though it were their own. Yet, in one who, like\r\nyourself, \"by birth inherits glory from a noble race,\" as Pindar has it,\r\nand who, as you do, imitates in his own life the noblest examples of his\r\nancestry, may well take pleasure in discoursing upon the lives of\r\nwell-born men, and in listening to the remarks of others about them.\r\nThey do not depend for praise upon the lives of other men, because there\r\nis nothing to be admired in themselves, but they combine the glory of\r\ntheir ancestors with their own, and honour them both as having founded\r\ntheir families and as having set examples to be imitated. For this\r\nreason I have sent to you the life of Aratus, which I have compiled, not\r\nthat I was not aware that you had carefully studied all his achievements\r\nand were well acquainted with them, but with the hope that your sons,\r\nPolykrates and Pythokles, might be brought up to imitate the glorious\r\nexample of their forefathers, and might learn to walk in their footsteps\r\nby reading and discussing the history of their exploits. Indeed, to\r\nimagine that one has already arrived at perfection, argues self-conceit\r\nrather than true greatness of character.\r\n\r\nII. The city of Sikyon, as soon as it lost its original oligarchic\r\nDorian constitution, became distracted by internal faction, and at last\r\nfell into the hands of a series of despotic rulers. After the last of\r\nthese, named Kleon, had been put to death, the citizens placed the\r\ngovernment in the hands of Timokleides and Kleinias, two of their most\r\nhonourable and influential men. But as soon as a settled form of\r\ngovernment began to be established, Timokleides died, and Abantidas, the\r\nson of Paseas, in order to obtain the supreme power for himself,\r\nassassinated Kleinias, and either banished or put to death all his\r\nrelatives and friends. He endeavoured to kill Kleinias's son, Aratus,\r\nwho was left an orphan at the age of seven; however, during the\r\nconfusion which prevailed in the house, the child wandered out into the\r\ncity, and, terrified and helpless, made his way unnoticed into the house\r\nof Soso, Abantidas's sister, whose husband was Prophantus, the brother\r\nof Kleinias. She was naturally a high-souled lady, and thought also that\r\nthe child must have been directed by heaven to take refuge in her house.\r\nShe hid him from his enemies, and that night sent him away to Argos.\r\n\r\nIII. This adventurous escape from so terrible a danger produced in the\r\nmind of Aratus the fiercest hatred of all despots. He was brought up by\r\nhis father's friends at Argos in a manner becoming his birth, and as he\r\ngrew up tall and strong, he devoted himself to gymnastic exercises in\r\nthe palæstra, and even gained a crown for success in the pentathlum. We\r\ncan trace the effects of this training in his statues, which represent\r\nan intellectual and commanding countenance, and also the effects of the\r\nliberal diet and work[586] with the spade practised by the professional\r\nathlete. For this reason he paid less attention to oratory than became a\r\npublic man; yet he was a better speaker than some suppose, which is\r\nproved by the study of his hastily and plainly-written memoirs.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, Deinias and Aristotle the logician formed a plot\r\nagainst Abantidas, who was accustomed to come and spend his leisure time\r\nin the open market-place with them, listening to their discourse and\r\narguing with them. They drew him into a discussion and assassinated him.\r\nHe was succeeded by his father, Paseas, who was soon treacherously slain\r\nby Nikokles, who now declared himself despot of Sikyon. We are told that\r\nthis man was singularly like Periander, the son of Kypselus, just as the\r\nPersian Orontes bore a striking resemblance to Alkmæon, the son of\r\nAmphiaraus, and a certain young Spartan so closely resembled Hector,\r\nthat he was trampled to death by the multitudes who came to see him and\r\nsatisfy their curiosity.\r\n\r\nIV. Nikokles reigned four months, during which time he did the city much\r\nhurt, and very nearly lost it to the Ætolians, who had formed a plot to\r\nsurprise it. Aratus was now nearly grown up, and possessed great\r\ninfluence, both on account of his noble birth, and because he was\r\nalready well known to be possessed of an enterprising spirit, combined\r\nwith a prudence beyond his years. In consequence of this, all the other\r\nSikyonian exiles looked upon him as their leader, and Nikokles himself\r\nregarded him with apprehension, and quietly took precautions against\r\nhim, never supposing that he would attempt so audacious an enterprise as\r\nhe did, but thinking he would probably make overtures to some of the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander, who had been guests[587] and friends of his\r\nfather. Indeed, Aratus did attempt to obtain assistance from some of\r\nthem; but since Antigonus, though he promised his aid, temporised and\r\nhesitated to act, and his hopes from Egypt and Ptolemy were too remote,\r\nhe determined to overthrow the despot alone.\r\n\r\nV. The first persons to whom he communicated his design were\r\nAristomachus and Ekdelus, of whom the former was an exile from Sikyon,\r\nwhile Ekdelus was an Arcadian of Megalopolis, a man of culture as well\r\nas of action, who had been an intimate friend of Arkesilaus, the\r\nAcademic philosopher at Athens. As both these men readily accepted his\r\nproposals, Aratus began to discuss the project with the other exiles.\r\nSome few felt ashamed to abandon all hope of restoration to their\r\ncountry, and joined Aratus, but most of them tried to hinder him from\r\nmaking the attempt, alleging that his daring was the result of\r\ninexperience. While Aratus was meditating whether he could not seize\r\nsome strong place within the territory of Sikyon, and make it the base\r\nof his operations against the despot, there came to Argos a certain\r\nSikyonian who had escaped from prison. This man was the brother of\r\nXenokles, one of the exiles; and when brought to Aratus by his brother,\r\ntold him that the city wall, at the place where he himself climbed over\r\nit and made his escape, was very nearly level with the ground on the\r\ninside, as it was built up against high and rocky ground, while on the\r\noutside it was not so high as to be beyond the reach of scaling-ladders.\r\nAratus, when he heard this, sent Xenokles with two of his own servants,\r\nnamed Seuthas and Technon, to reconnoitre the spot, for he was\r\ndetermined, if possible, to risk everything by one sudden and secret\r\nassault, rather than openly to engage in what might prove a long and\r\ntedious war, waged, as it would be by a private man against the despotic\r\nruler of a state. Xenokles, on his return, reported that he had measured\r\nthe height of the walls, and that the ground presented no difficulties\r\nfor their attempt, but he said that it would be difficult to reach the\r\nplace unobserved, because of the dogs of a gardener who dwelt near,\r\nwhich, though small, were peculiarly ferocious and savage. Upon hearing\r\nthis, Aratus at once began to prepare for the attempt.\r\n\r\nVI. The use of arms was, at that period, familiar to all men, because of\r\nthe constant marauding incursions which each state continually made upon\r\nthe territory of its neighbours. The scaling-ladders were made openly by\r\nEuphranor the carpenter, one of the exiles, whose trade enabled him to\r\nconstruct them without exciting suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe Argive friends of Aratus each contributed ten men from their own\r\nhouseholds; while he himself was able to arm thirty slaves of his own.\r\nHe also hired from Xenokrilus, the well-known captain of robbers, a\r\nsmall band of soldiers, who were told that the object of the incursion\r\ninto the Sikyonian territory was to carry off some horses belonging to\r\nKing Antigonus. Most of the band were ordered to make their way in\r\nscattered parties to the tower of Polygnotus, and there to wait for\r\ntheir leaders. Kaphisias, in light marching order, with four others, was\r\nsent on in advance, with instructions to present himself at the house of\r\nthe gardener about nightfall. Under the pretext of being wayfaring men\r\nseeking for hospitality, they were to obtain lodgings there for the\r\nnight, and secure both the man and his dogs, for unless this was done it\r\nwould be impossible to reach the walls. The scaling-ladders, which were\r\nmade to take to pieces, were packed in chests, covered over, and sent\r\nforward in waggons. Meanwhile, as several spies sent by Nikokles had\r\nappeared in Argos, who were said to be quietly watching the movements of\r\nAratus, he rose at daybreak, and spent the day in the open market-place,\r\nconversing with his friends. Towards evening he anointed himself in the\r\npalæstra, and then went home, taking with him several of the companions\r\nwith whom he was accustomed to drink and amuse himself. Soon after this\r\nhis servants were seen crossing the market-place, one carrying garlands,\r\nanother buying torches, and another bargaining with the female musicians\r\nwho were wont to attend at banquets. The spies, seeing all these\r\npreparations, were deceived and laughingly said to one another, \"Surely\r\nthere is nothing more cowardly than a tyrant, if Nikokles, with such a\r\ncity and armed force at his disposal, really fears this youth, who\r\nwastes the income on which he has to subsist in exile, on amusements and\r\non wine parties before it is even dark.\"\r\n\r\nVII. Thus the spies were thrown off their guard; but Aratus, immediately\r\nafter supper, sallied forth, met his men at the tower of Polygnotus, and\r\nled them to Nemea where he explained, to most of them for the first\r\ntime, what he was about to attempt. After promising them rewards in case\r\nof success, and addressing to them a few words of encouragement, he gave\r\nPropitious Apollo as the watchword, and proceeded towards the city,\r\nregulating his march according to the moon, so that he was able to make\r\nuse of its light to march by, and when it was setting arrived at the\r\ngarden outside the walls. Here Kaphisias met him, with the news that he\r\nhad not been able to secure the dogs, which had run away, but that he\r\nhad locked up the gardener in his house. On hearing this most of the\r\nconspirators became disheartened, and demanded to be led back again; but\r\nAratus pacified them by promising that, if the dogs attacked them and\r\ngave the alarm, he would give up the attempt. He now sent forward a\r\nparty with the scaling-ladders, under the command of Ekdelus and\r\nMnesitheus, and himself proceeded at a leisurely pace. The dogs at once\r\nset upon the party under Ekdelus, and kept up a continuous barking;\r\nnevertheless they reached the wall and placed the ladders against it\r\nundisturbed. While the foremost were mounting, the officer who was being\r\nrelieved by the morning guard passed that way carrying a bell, and there\r\nwas a great flashing of lights and trampling of marching soldiers. The\r\nconspirators remained where they were, crouching upon their ladders, and\r\nwithout difficulty escaped the notice of this patrol, but they were\r\nterribly near being discovered by a second body of guards marching in\r\nthe opposite direction. As soon as this also had passed by without\r\nnoticing them, the leaders, Mnesitheus and Ekdelus, at once mounted upon\r\nthe walls, secured the passage along the walls both on the right and on\r\nthe left, and despatched Technon to Aratus, bidding him hasten to the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nVIII. At no great distance from the garden there stood a tower upon the\r\nwalls, in which a great hound was kept for a watch. This hound had not\r\nnoticed the approach of the escalading party, either because he was dull\r\nof hearing, or because he was tired with exercise the day before. When,\r\nhowever, the gardener's little dogs roused him by their clamour at the\r\nfoot of the wall, he at first set up a low growling, and then, as the\r\nparty drew nearer, began to bark furiously. He made so much noise that\r\nthe sentry on the next tower called out in a loud voice to the huntsman\r\nin charge of the dog, asking him at what the hound was barking so\r\nsavagely, and whether anything was wrong. The huntsman replied from his\r\ntower that all was well, only that the hound had been disturbed by the\r\nlights of the patrol and the sound of their bell. This gave great\r\nencouragement to Aratus's party, who imagined that the huntsman spoke\r\nthus because he had seen them and wished to screen them from observation\r\nand assist their plot, and that many others in the city might be willing\r\nto do the same. Yet, the scaling of the walls was a long and dangerous\r\noperation, as the ladders were too weak to bear the weight of more than\r\none man mounting slowly at a time, yet time pressed, for the cocks had\r\nalready begun to crow, and soon the country people might be expected to\r\narrive, bringing their wares to market. So, now, Aratus, himself hastily\r\nmounted, after forty of his men had reached the top, and while the\r\nremainder were still mounting, he marched straight to the despot's\r\nhouse, and the guard-room in which his mercenary troops passed the\r\nnight. By a sudden assault he took them all prisoners without killing\r\none of them, and at once sent messengers to summon his own friends from\r\ntheir houses. Day was breaking while they assembled, and soon the\r\ntheatre was filled with an excited crowd without any distinct idea of\r\nwhat was happening, until a herald came forward and announced to the\r\npeople that Aratus, the son of Kleinias, invited his fellow-citizens to\r\nregain their liberty.\r\n\r\nIX. The people now, at last, believed that their long-looked-for\r\ndeliverers had indeed come, and rushed in a body to set fire to the\r\ndespot's house. The burning house made such a prodigious blaze that it\r\nwas seen as far as Corinth, where the citizens were so much astonished,\r\nthat they were within a little of setting out to rescue Sikyon from the\r\nflames. Nikokles himself escaped by a subterranean passage, and got\r\nclear away from the city, and his soldiers, with the assistance of the\r\ncitizens, put out the fire and plundered his house. Aratus did not\r\nattempt to stop this proceeding, and distributed the remainder of the\r\ndespot's treasure among the citizens. No one was killed or wounded,\r\neither of the attacking or defending party, but by good fortune this\r\ngreat exploit was accomplished without spilling a drop of blood. Aratus\r\nnow restored the citizens whom Nikokles had banished, who were eighty in\r\nnumber, and also those who had been driven into exile by his\r\npredecessors, who amounted to no less than five hundred. These latter\r\nhad been forced to wander from place to place for a period of nearly\r\nfifty years. They now returned, very poor for the most part, and at once\r\nlaid claim to the property which had once been theirs. Their attempts to\r\ngain possession of their houses and lands caused the greatest\r\ndisquietude to Aratus, who saw the city plotted against from without,\r\nand viewed with dislike by Antigonus on account of its free\r\nconstitution, while within it was full of faction and disturbance. Under\r\nthese circumstances he did what he thought was best, by making the city\r\na member of the Achæan league: and the people of Sikyon, Dorians as they\r\nwere, willingly adopted the name and entered into the confederacy of the\r\nAchæans, who at that time were neither famous nor powerful. Most of them\r\ndwelt in small towns, and their territory was both confined and\r\nunproductive, while the sea-shore, near which they lived, was without\r\nharbours, and for the most part exposed to a terrible surf. Yet these\r\nmen, more than any others, proved that Greeks are invincible wherever\r\nthey are collected into regularly organised communities, and with a\r\ncapable general to lead them. They were but an insignificant fraction of\r\nthe mighty Greece of former times, and had not altogether the strength\r\nof one single considerable city; yet, by wise counsel and agreement\r\namong themselves, and by following and obeying their greatest man,\r\ninstead of being jealous of his power, they not only preserved their own\r\nliberties, although surrounded by so many powerful cities and despots,\r\nbut were constantly able to assist the rest of the Greeks in recovering\r\nand defending their freedom.\r\n\r\nX. Aratus was by nature a politician, and was of a magnanimous\r\ndisposition, more careful of the interests of the state than of his own.\r\nHe regarded all despots with a peculiarly rancorous hatred, but in\r\nrespect to other persons, made his personal likes and dislikes\r\nsubordinate to the good of his country. For this reason his zeal for his\r\nfriends does not appear to have been so remarkable as his mild and\r\nforgiving treatment of his enemies; for he regulated his private\r\nfeelings entirely by considerations of public expediency. He loved to\r\nform alliances between states, to connect cities into confederations,\r\nand to teach the leaders and the people alike to act together with\r\nunanimity. Singularly timid and faint-hearted in open war and in battles\r\nfought by daylight, he nevertheless was most dexterous at planning\r\nsurprises, winning cities, and overthrowing despots. For this reason he\r\noften succeeded in his rashest enterprises, and often, through excessive\r\ncaution, failed when success would have been comparatively easy. Some\r\nwild animals see best in the dark, and are nearly blind during the\r\ndaytime, because the moist nature of their eyes cannot endure the dry\r\nand searching rays of the sun; and so, too, it appears that some men\r\nlose their courage and are easily disconcerted when they are fighting\r\nopenly in broad daylight, but yet recover all their bravery as soon as\r\nthey engage in secret stratagems and midnight surprises. These anomalies\r\nmust be attributed to a want of philosophic reflection in noble minds,\r\nwhich effect great things naturally, and without acting by rule or\r\nmethod, just as we see good fruit produced by wild and uncultivated\r\ntrees. I will now proceed to prove this by examples.\r\n\r\nXI. Aratus, after he had joined himself and his native city to the\r\nAchæan league, served in the cavalry force, and made himself generally\r\nbeloved by the ready obedience which he showed to his commanders; for\r\nhe, although he had rendered the league such important services in\r\nputting his own illustrious name and the power of the city of Sikyon at\r\nits disposal, yet, as if he were a mere private man, obeyed whoever\r\nmight be in command, even though he were a citizen of Dyme, or of\r\nTritæa, or even some more insignificant city. Aratus was now presented\r\nwith the sum of five-and-twenty talents by the king.[588] This he\r\nreceived, but spent it all on relieving his destitute fellow-countrymen,\r\nand in ransoming them from slavery.\r\n\r\nXII. As the returned exiles could not be withheld from attacking those\r\nwhom they found in possession of their property, and by doing so seemed\r\nlikely to bring the state to ruin, Aratus, thinking that nothing but the\r\nkindness of Ptolemy could save his country, started upon a voyage to\r\nEgypt, to beg the king to furnish him with a sum of money, by means of\r\nwhich he might persuade the contending parties to come to an amicable\r\nagreement. He started from the port of Mothone, and sailed beyond Cape\r\nMillea, meaning to cross directly over the sea to Egypt. However, the\r\nsea was very rough, and the wind contrary, which, caused the captain of\r\nthe ship to bear up, and run along the coast until, with great\r\ndifficulty, he reached Adria,[589] which was an enemy's country, for it\r\nwas in the possession of Antigonus, who had placed a Macedonian garrison\r\nin it. Aratus contrived to keep out of the way of the garrison, and,\r\nleaving the ship, proceeded a long way inland, accompanied by one single\r\nfriend, named Timanthes. They concealed themselves in a thick wood, and\r\npassed the night as best they could. Shortly afterwards the Macedonian\r\nofficer in charge appeared, and endeavoured to find Aratus, but was put\r\noff the scent by the slaves of Aratus, who had been instructed to say\r\nthat their master, as soon as he left them, had sailed in another vessel\r\nbound to Euboea. However, the Macedonian declared the cargo, the vessel,\r\nand the slaves to be a lawful prize, as being enemy's property, and\r\ndetained them as such. A few days after this, when Aratus was almost at\r\nhis wit's end, by good fortune a Roman ship touched at the place where\r\nhe was spending his time in looking out for means of escape by sea, and\r\nin trying to conceal himself from his enemies on land. The ship was\r\nbound for Syria, but Aratus would not sail in it until he had persuaded\r\nthe captain to land him in Karia. On his voyage thither he again\r\nencountered great dangers: but at length he succeeded in obtaining a\r\npassage from Karia to Egypt, where he was warmly received by the king,\r\nwho had always had a favourable opinion of him, and who had lately\r\nreceived from him many drawings and paintings by Greek artists. Aratus,\r\nwho had considerable taste in these matters, constantly purchased and\r\ncollected the works of the most skilful and famous painters, especially\r\nthose of Pamphilus and Melanthus, and used to send them as presents to\r\nKing Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nXIII. At that time the Sikyonian school of painting was still celebrated\r\nthroughout Greece, and was thought more than any other to have preserved\r\nthe purity of the ancient style. Even the great Apelles, when already\r\nfamous, had come to Sikyon and paid a talent for some lessons from the\r\nmasters there, although by doing so he hoped to increase his reputation\r\nrather than to improve his art. When Aratus set the city free, he at\r\nonce destroyed all the portraits[590] of the despots, except that of\r\nAristratus, who flourished in the time of Philip,[591] about which he\r\nhesitated for a long time; for the picture in which Aristratus was\r\nrepresented standing beside the chariot which won him a prize in the\r\ngames, was the joint work of all the pupils of Melanthus, and we are\r\ntold by Polemon the geographer, that some parts of it were painted by\r\nApelles himself. The execution was so admirable that Aratus for a moment\r\nrelented, but soon afterwards his fierce hatred of all the despots made\r\nhim order it to be destroyed. However, Nealkes the painter, who was a\r\nfriend of Aratus, interceded for the picture with tears, and as he could\r\nnot move Aratus, at last said, \"We ought to make war against despots\r\nthemselves, but not against their surroundings. Let us leave the chariot\r\nand the figure of Victory, and I will deliver up Aristratus to you, by\r\nwiping him out of the picture.\" Aratus allowed Nealkes to do this, and\r\nhe effaced the figure of Aristratus, and painted a palm tree in its\r\nplace, without venturing to add anything else. It is said that after\r\ndestroying the figure of Aristratus, the painter forgot his feet, and\r\nthat they were still to be seen under the chariot. By presents of such\r\npaintings as these Aratus had already disposed Ptolemy to regard him\r\nwith favour; and when they met, Aratus so charmed the king by his\r\nconversation that he received from him a present of one hundred and\r\nfifty talents for the use of his native city. Aratus carried forty\r\ntalents home with him at once to Peloponnesus, and afterwards received\r\nthe rest of the sum in instalments from the king.\r\n\r\nXIV. It was a truly great action for Aratus to bestow so much money upon\r\nhis fellow-countrymen, especially at a time when for much smaller sums\r\nthe kings were usually able to bribe the other chiefs and popular\r\nleaders to betray their native cities and sacrifice their constitutional\r\nliberties; but it was even more admirable that by means of this money he\r\nreconciled the rich and the poor, and saved the state from all the\r\ndanger of revolution, while his own conduct was marked by the greatest\r\nmoderation in spite of his enormous power. When he was appointed as sole\r\narbitrator with unlimited authority, to decide upon the claims of the\r\nexiled families to their inheritances, he refused to act alone, and\r\nassociated fifteen of the other citizens with himself, with whose help,\r\nafter much labour and difficulty, he restored peace and union amongst\r\nhis countrymen. For these services the state bestowed upon him fitting\r\nhonours, but in addition to these the exiles gave him a special mark of\r\ntheir regard by erecting a brazen statue, upon which was inscribed the\r\nfollowing verses:--\r\n\r\n   \"For wisdom, valour, and great deeds in war\r\n    Thy fame, Aratus, has been noised afar.\r\n    We, that unhappy exiles were of late,\r\n    Brought home by thee, this statute dedicate\r\n    To all the gods who helped thee to restore\r\n    Peace and goodwill amongst us as before.\"\r\n\r\nXV. By this important measure Aratus so thoroughly earned the gratitude\r\nof his countrymen as to be placed above the reach of party jealousy; but\r\nKing Antigonus was much displeased at his success, and with the object\r\neither of making him his friend, or of causing him to be distrusted by\r\nPtolemy, bestowed upon him several marks of favour, and when sacrificing\r\nto the gods at Corinth even sent some of the meat of the victim to\r\nSikyon as a present for him. At dinner that evening he said aloud in the\r\nhearing of many guests: \"I thought this young Sikyonian was merely a\r\nwell-bred and patriotic youth; but it seems that he is a very shrewd\r\njudge of the lives and politics of us kings. At first he used to despise\r\nme, and looked beyond me to Egypt, because he had heard so much about\r\nthe elephants and fleets of Ptolemy, and about the splendour of his\r\ncourt, but now that he has been admitted behind the scenes there and has\r\ndiscovered it to be all empty show and parade, he has thrown himself\r\ninto my arms without reserve. So now I receive the youth into my own\r\nservice, and shall employ him in all my affairs; and I beg you all to\r\ntreat him as a friend.\"\r\n\r\nAll those who were jealous of Aratus and who wished him ill, as soon as\r\nthey heard these words, vied with one another in sending letters to\r\nPtolemy, full of abuse of Aratus, until at length Ptolemy himself wrote\r\nto Aratus and reproached him for his disloyalty. So much jealousy and\r\nill-feeling does the friendship of kings produce among those who most\r\neagerly struggle to gain it.\r\n\r\nXVI. Aratus, who was now for the first time elected general of the\r\nAchæans, invaded and plundered the countries of Kalydonia and Lokris on\r\nthe other side of the Corinthian gulf, but though he marched with ten\r\nthousand men to help the Boeotians he came too late to take part in the\r\nbattle, in which they were defeated near Chæronea by the Ætolians. In\r\nthis battle a thousand Boeotians perished, amongst whom was Aboeokritus\r\nthe Boeotarch himself. Next year Aratus was again chosen general, and\r\nbegan to arrange his plot for the capture of the Akrocorinthus, or\r\ncitadel of Corinth. He made this attempt not to benefit the Achæans, or\r\nhis own city of Sikyon, but solely with the object of driving out the\r\nMacedonian garrison, which was established there as the common despot\r\nover all Greece. The Athenian Chares, after gaining some success in\r\nbattle over the generals of the King of Persia, sent home a despatch to\r\nthe Athenian people in which he declared that he had won the sister\r\nvictory to that of Marathon: and this exploit of Aratus may be most\r\ntruly described as sister to those of Pelopidas the Theban and of\r\nThrasybulus the Athenian, in which they each killed the despots of their\r\nrespective cities; except that this assault was not delivered against\r\nGreeks, but against a foreign and alien sovereignty. Now the isthmus,\r\nwhich bars out the two seas, connects together the two parts of our\r\ncontinent; but the Acrocorinthus, which is a lofty mountain placed in\r\nthe middle of Greece, if it be held by an armed force, cuts off the land\r\nbeyond the isthmus from all intercourse with the rest of Greece, whether\r\nfor warlike or commercial purposes, and places the whole country at the\r\nmercy of the commander of its garrison; so that the younger Philip was\r\nnot in jest but in earnest when he called the city of Corinth the \"key\r\nof Greece.\"\r\n\r\nXVII. The possession of this place was always coveted by all princes and\r\nrulers, but the desire of Antigonus for it became a frantic passion, and\r\nhis whole thoughts were occupied with plots to obtain it by stratagem,\r\nsince it was hopeless to attempt to take it by force. After the death of\r\nAlexander,[592] who originally held it, and who, it is said, was\r\npoisoned by Antigonus, his wife Nikæa succeeded to his kingdom, and held\r\nthe Acrocorinthus. Antigonus now at once sent his son Demetrius to her,\r\nand by holding out the dazzling prospect of a royal alliance and a\r\nhandsome young husband to a woman somewhat past her prime, made a\r\nconquest of her by means of his son, whom he employed without scruple to\r\ntempt his victim. As, however, she would not give up the citadel, but\r\nkept it strongly guarded, Antigonus pretended to be indifferent to it,\r\nand prepared a wedding feast in Corinth, spending the whole day in\r\nattendance at spectacles and in wine-drinking, as if he had entirely\r\ngiven himself up to pleasure and enjoyment. When the time drew near for\r\nthe attempt, he himself accompanied Nikæa to the theatre to hear Amoebeus\r\nsing. They were carried together in royal state in a splendidly\r\nornamented litter, and she was delighted at the respect which he showed\r\nher, and was as far as possible from guessing his real purpose. When\r\nthey arrived at the point where the road turned off towards the citadel,\r\nhe begged her to proceed alone to the theatre, and without troubling\r\nhimself further about Amoebeus or the marriage, ran up to the\r\nAcrocorinthus faster than one would have expected in a man of his age.\r\nFinding the gate shut, he knocked at it with his stick, bidding the\r\ngarrison open it; and they, astounded at his audacity, threw it open.\r\nWhen he had thus obtained possession of the place he could no longer\r\nrestrain himself, but although he was now an old man, and had\r\nexperienced great vicissitudes of fortune, he drank wine and jumped for\r\njoy in the streets, and swaggered riotously across the market-place,\r\ncrowned with flowers, and accompanied by singing-girls, greeting and\r\nshaking hands with every one whom he met. So true it is that unexpected\r\njoy disturbs the right balance of the mind more than either grief or\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Now Antigonus, having, as above related, gained possession of the\r\nAcrocorinthus, entrusted the place to some of his most faithful\r\nofficers, among whom was Persæus the philosopher. Aratus, during the\r\nlife of Alexander, had begun to form a plan for surprising the citadel,\r\nbut desisted from his plot when Alexander became an ally of the Achæans.\r\nHe now began to form fresh schemes, in the following manner:--There were\r\nin Corinth four brothers, Syrians by birth, one of whom, named Diokles,\r\nwas serving in the garrison, and quartered in the citadel. The other\r\nthree, having robbed the king's treasury, came to Sikyon to dispose of\r\nthe plunder to a banker named Ægias, who was well known to Aratus from\r\nhaving had dealings with him. They disposed of a considerable part of\r\ntheir plunder at first, and afterwards, one of them, named Erginus, came\r\nquietly over from time to time with the remainder. In this way he became\r\nintimate with Ægias, and, being led on by him to talk about the citadel,\r\nsaid that when going up the hill to visit his brother, he had noticed a\r\nnarrow path on one side, which led to the lowest part of the wall of the\r\nfortress. On hearing this, Ægias laughingly said to him, \"My good sir,\r\nwhy do you rob the king's treasury to gain such pitiful sums of money,\r\nwhen you might gain great riches in a single hour? Do you not know that\r\nburglary and treachery are alike punished with death?\" Erginus smiled at\r\nthis, and agreed to sound his brother Diokles upon this point; for he\r\ncould not, he said, place much confidence in the other two.\r\n\r\nIn a few days he returned, undertook to lead Aratus to a part of the\r\nwall which was not more than fifteen feet high, and arranged that both\r\nhe and his brother Diokles would do all in their power to assist him.\r\n\r\nXIX. Aratus promised that he would give them sixty talents if\r\nsuccessful, and that, in case of failure, if he and they survived, he\r\nwould give each of them a house and a talent. As the money had to be\r\ndeposited with Ægias for the satisfaction of Erginus, Aratus, who did\r\nnot possess the sum necessary, and who did not wish to lead others to\r\nsuspect his design by borrowing, took the greater part of his own plate\r\nand his wife's jewels, and pledged them with Ægias for the money.\r\nIndeed, he was of so lofty a soul, and so passionately desirous of\r\nglory, that although he knew that Phokion and Epameinondas had gained\r\nthe reputation of being the most just and noble of the Greeks, by\r\nrefusing large bribes and not sacrificing honour to money, he preferred\r\nto expend his fortune secretly in enterprises in which he alone risked\r\nhis life on behalf of the many, who did not even know what he was doing.\r\nWho, even in our own day, could refrain from admiring and longing to\r\nshare the fortunes of a man who bought for himself so great a danger at\r\nso high a price, and who pawned the most valuable of his possessions in\r\norder that he might make his way into the fortress of his enemies by\r\nnight and fight for his life there, gaining by his deposit the hope of\r\nglory, but nothing else?\r\n\r\nXX. The plot, dangerous enough in itself, was rendered even more so at\r\nits very outset by a blunder. Technon, the servant of Aratus, was sent\r\nto examine the wall together with Diokles. He had never before met\r\nDiokles, but imagining that he knew his appearance from Erginus's\r\ndescription of him as a man with close curly hair, a dark complexion,\r\nand no beard, went to the rendezvous, and waited outside the city, near\r\nthe place called Ornis, for Erginus, who was to meet him there with his\r\nbrother Diokles. In the meantime the brother of Erginus and Diokles,\r\nnamed Dionysius, who was not in the plot, and knew nothing of what was\r\ngoing on, happened to come up. He was very like Diokles, and Technon,\r\ninfluenced by the likeness, inquired of him if he were in any way\r\nconnected with Erginus. As he answered that he was his brother, Technon\r\nwas quite certain that he was addressing Diokles; and without asking his\r\nname or waiting for any further proof of identity he gave him his hand,\r\nspoke of the compact with Erginus, and asked him questions about it. He\r\ncleverly encouraged Technon in his error, agreed to everything that he\r\nsaid, and, turning round, walked with him towards the city without\r\nexciting his suspicions. When he was close to the gate, and had all but\r\ninveigled Technon through it, it chanced that Erginus met them.\r\nPerceiving the trick which his brother had played, and the danger in\r\nwhich Technon was placed, he warned him by a sign to make his escape,\r\nand both of them, running away at full speed, got safe back to Aratus.\r\nYet he did not despair, but at once sent Erginus to take some money to\r\nDionysius, and to beg him to hold his tongue. Erginus accomplished his\r\ncommission, and brought Dionysius back with him to Aratus. When he\r\narrived there they would not let him go again, but kept him a close\r\nprisoner, while they themselves prepared to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nXXI. When all was ready, Aratus ordered the greater part of his force to\r\npass the night under arms, and himself with a chosen body of four\r\nhundred men, few of whom were in the secret, proceeded towards the gates\r\nof Corinth, near the temple of Hera. The time was the height of summer.\r\nThe moon was at the full, and as the night was clear and cloudless, they\r\nbegan to fear that the light gleaming from their arms would betray them\r\nto the sentinels. However, when the leading men were near to the wall a\r\nfog came up from the sea, and enveloped the whole city and its\r\nneighbourhood. Now, the men all sat down and took off their shoes; for\r\nmen who mount ladders with naked feet make very little noise and are not\r\nso liable to slip. Meanwhile Erginus, with seven youths dressed as\r\nwayfaring men, made his way up to the gate unsuspected. They killed the\r\nkeeper of the gate, and the guard: while at the same time the\r\nscaling-ladders were placed against the walls. Aratus hastily crossed\r\nthe walls with a hundred men. Bidding the remainder follow as fast as\r\nthey could, he ordered the ladders to be drawn up, and, followed by his\r\nhundred men, ran through the town to the citadel, overjoyed at having\r\ngot so far without raising an alarm, and already certain of success.\r\nWhile they were still some distance off, they met a patrol of four men\r\ncarrying a light. These men could not see them because they were in the\r\nshadow of the moon, but the four men were clearly visible as they\r\nmarched straight towards them. Aratus now drew his force a little aside\r\namong some ruins and low walls, so as to form an ambush, and set upon\r\nthe men. Three were killed on the spot, but the fourth, though wounded\r\nin the head by a blow from a sword, ran away shouting that the enemy\r\nwere within the walls. Soon after this trumpets were sounded, the whole\r\ncity was disturbed, and all the streets became thronged with men running\r\nto and fro, while many lights appeared, some in the lower town, and some\r\nin the citadel above, and a confused murmur of voices was heard on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nXXII. While this was going on, Aratus persevered in his march, and was\r\ntoiling laboriously up the cliff. At first he proceeded slowly and with\r\ndifficulty, without making any real progress, because he had entirely\r\nmissed the path, which wound about under the shadow of the precipitous\r\nrocks by many turnings and windings up to the citadel. At this moment it\r\nis said that the moon shone through the clouds and threw her light upon\r\nthe most difficult part of the ascent in a wonderful manner, until\r\nAratus reached the part of the wall of the citadel which he wished to\r\nattack. When he was there, she again concealed and shaded her rays\r\nbehind a barrier of clouds. While this was being done, the three hundred\r\nmen of Aratus's force, who had been left outside the gate near the\r\ntemple of Hera, when they made their way into the city, which was now\r\nfull of confusion and lights, were not able to find the same path which\r\nhad been followed by the others, or any trace of the way by which they\r\nhad gone, and so in a body crouched down in a dark corner in the shade\r\nof a cliff, and waited there in great anxiety and alarm: for now the\r\nparty led by Aratus was being shot at by the garrison of the citadel,\r\nand was fighting with them hand to hand, and the shouts of the battle\r\ncould be plainly heard below, though the echoes of the mountains made it\r\nimpossible to tell from what quarter the noise proceeded. While they\r\nwere at a loss to know which way to turn, Archelaus, the leader of the\r\nMacedonian troops, marched out with a large force, with loud shouts and\r\ntrumpets sounding, to attack the party under Aratus, and marched past\r\nwhere the three hundred lay as it were in ambush. They rushed out,\r\ncharged the Macedonians, killed the first of them, and drove Archelaus\r\nand the remainder before them panic-stricken, until they dispersed\r\nthemselves about the city. No sooner had this victory been won, than\r\nErginus arrived from the citadel, announcing that Aratus was engaged\r\nwith the enemy, who were offering a stubborn resistance, that a great\r\nbattle was going on at the wall itself, and that immediate assistance\r\nwas required. They at once bade him lead them, and mounted the hill,\r\nshouting to their friends to let them know who they were, and to\r\nencourage them. The full moon, too, as it shone upon their arms, made\r\ntheir numbers appear greater to the enemy on account of the length of\r\nthe path, and the midnight echoes made their shouts appear to come from\r\na much larger party of men. At last they joined their friends above, and\r\nby a united effort drove out the enemy, won the heights, and gained\r\npossession of the citadel just as day was dawning. Soon the sun rose\r\nupon their victory, and the remainder of Aratus's force from Sikyon came\r\nup, and was welcomed by the Corinthians, who opened their gates to them,\r\nand assisted them to capture the soldiers of the Macedonian garrison.\r\n\r\nXXIII. When all appeared to be safe, Aratus descended from the citadel\r\nto the theatre, where an enormous multitude of persons was collected,\r\neager to see him and to hear the speech which he was about to address to\r\nthe Corinthians. He placed a guard of Achæans on each side of the stage,\r\nand himself appeared in the middle, still wearing his corslet, and pale\r\nwith the labours of a sleepless night, so that the triumph and delight\r\nwhich he felt were weighed down by sheer bodily lassitude. His\r\nappearance was greeted with enthusiastic applause, and, shifting his\r\nspear into his right hand, and slightly leaning his body against it, he\r\nstood for a long time silent, receiving the plaudits and shouts of those\r\nwho praised his courage and congratulated him on his good fortune. When\r\nthey had ceased and resumed their seats, he drew himself up and made\r\nthem a speech worthy of the occasion, on behalf of the Achæan league, in\r\nwhich he prevailed upon the Corinthians to join the league, and gave up\r\nto them the keys of their gates which now came into their possession for\r\nthe first time since the days of king Philip. He dismissed Archelaus,\r\nwho had been taken prisoner, but put Theophrastus to death because he\r\nrefused to leave his post. Persæus, when the citadel was taken, escaped\r\nto Kenchreæ. Afterwards it is said that in philosophic conversation,\r\nwhen some one said that he thought that the philosopher was the only\r\ntrue general, he answered, \"By heaven, this once used to please me more\r\nthan any other of Zeno's aphorisms, but I have changed my mind since the\r\nrefutation of it which I received from a young man of Sikyon.\" This\r\nanecdote of Persæus is related by most historians.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Aratus now at once made himself master of the temple of Hera, and\r\nof Lechæum, where he seized a fleet of five-and-twenty ships belonging\r\nto King Antigonus, and sold five hundred horses and four hundred Syrians\r\nwhom he found there. The Achæans now garrisoned the citadel of Corinth\r\nwith a force of four hundred heavy-armed soldiers, and with a pack of\r\nfifty hounds and as many huntsmen, who were all kept in the\r\ncitadel.[593]\r\n\r\nThe Romans in their admiration of Philopoemen used to call him the last\r\nof the Greeks, as though no great actions were performed in Greece after\r\nhis time: but I should be inclined to say that this was both the last\r\nand the most remarkable of all the great achievements of the Greeks, for\r\nboth in the daring with which it was accomplished, and the good fortune\r\nwith which it was attended, it will bear comparison with the noblest of\r\ndeeds, as was at once proved by its results. Megara revolted from\r\nAntigonus and joined Aratus, Troezene and Epidaurus became members of\r\nthe Achæan league, and Aratus made his first campaign by an expedition\r\ninto Attica, in the course of which he crossed into Salamis and laid it\r\nwaste, being able to make what use he pleased of the power of the Achæan\r\nleague, now that it was no longer, as it were, locked up in\r\nPeloponnesus. He sent back all the freemen whom he captured to Athens\r\nwithout ransom, hoping to rouse them to revolt against the Macedonians.\r\nHe also brought Ptolemy into alliance with the Achæan league, and\r\nconstituted him commander-in-chief of their forces by land and by sea.\r\nHis influence with the Achæans was so great, that, since it was illegal\r\nto elect him as their chief every year, they elected him every other\r\nyear, while practically they followed his advice in all their\r\ntransactions; for they saw that he preferred neither wealth, nor fame,\r\nnor the friendship of kings, nor the advantage of his own native country\r\nto the furtherance of the prosperity of the Achæans. He conceived that\r\ncities which by themselves were weak might obtain safety by means of one\r\nanother, bound together by their common interest, and that just as the\r\nvarious parts of the human body live and move when connected with one\r\nanother, but waste away and perish when cut asunder, so cities are\r\nruined by isolation, and prosper by confederation, when they form parts\r\nof one great body, and adopt a common line of policy.\r\n\r\nXXV. Observing that the most famous of the neighbouring cities were\r\nindependent, he became grieved that the Argives lived under the rule of\r\na despot, and began to plot the destruction of Aristomachus, their\r\nruler; wishing also to bestow its freedom upon the city to which he owed\r\nhis education, and to gain it over to the Achæan league. Men were found\r\nwho dared to make the attempt, chief among whom were Æschylus and\r\nCharimenes the soothsayer, but they had no swords, because the despot\r\nhad prohibited the possession of arms to the citizens under severe\r\npenalties. However, Aratus prepared at Corinth a number of small\r\ndaggers, which he caused to be sewn up in pack-saddles. He then placed\r\nthe saddles on pack-horses and sent them to Argos, laden with ordinary\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nBut Charimenes the soothsayer took another person into the plot, which\r\nso enraged Æschylus and his party that they determined to act alone, and\r\nwould have nothing more to do with Charimenes. In anger at this\r\ntreatment he betrayed his comrades just as they were on the point of\r\nattacking the despot, yet most of them had time to make their way out of\r\nthe market-place and escape to Corinth. Shortly afterwards Aristomachus\r\nwas assassinated by his own servants, and was immediately succeeded by\r\nAristippus, a more cruel tyrant than himself. Aratus upon hearing of\r\nthis at once made a hurried march to Argos at the head of as many\r\nAchæans as he could collect, hoping to find the city ready to join him.\r\nAs, however, most of the Argives were now accustomed to the loss of\r\ntheir liberty, and no one answered his appeal, he retired, having done\r\nno more than expose the Achæans to the charge of making a warlike\r\ninvasion in time of peace. For this they were tried before the\r\nMantineans as judges, and, as Aratus did not appear, Aristippus, who was\r\nprosecutor, won his cause and got a fine of thirty minæ laid upon the\r\nAchæans. As he both hated and feared Aratus himself, he now, with the\r\nconnivance of King Antigonus, endeavoured to have him assassinated; and\r\nthey soon had their emissaries everywhere, watching their opportunity.\r\nThere is, however, no such certain safeguard for a ruler as the love of\r\nhis people; for when both the masses and the leading men have learned\r\nnot to fear their chief, but to fear for him, he sees with many eyes,\r\nhears with many ears, and soon gains intelligence of any conspiracies.\r\nAnd in this place I wish to stop my narrative for a moment, and describe\r\nthe mode of life which Aristippus was compelled to lead in consequence\r\nof being a despot, and possessing that position of absolute ruler which\r\nmen are wont so greatly to admire and envy.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Aristippus had Antigonus for his ally, kept a large force on foot\r\nfor his own protection, and left none of his enemies alive in the city\r\nof Argos. He used to make his bodyguard and household troops encamp in\r\nthe porticoes outside his palace, and always, after supper, sent all his\r\nservants out of the room, locked the door himself, and betook himself\r\nwith his mistress to a little upper chamber which was reached by a\r\ntrapdoor, upon which he placed his bed and slept, as one may expect, a\r\ndisturbed and frightened sleep. His mistress's mother used to take away\r\nthe ladder by which they mounted, and lock it up in another room. At\r\ndaybreak she used to bring it back again, and call down this glorious\r\nmonarch, who came out like a snake out of his den.\r\n\r\nAratus, who dressed in the plainest of clothes, and was the declared\r\nenemy of despots wherever they were to be found, gained for himself a\r\nlasting command, not by force of arms, but by legal means by his own\r\ncourage, and has left a posterity which even at the present day enjoys\r\nthe greatest honour in Greece; whereas of all those men who seized\r\nstrongholds, kept bodyguards, and protected their lives with arms and\r\ngates and trapdoors, few escaped being knocked on the head like hares,\r\nand no one has left either a palace, or a family, or a monument to do\r\nhonour to his memory.\r\n\r\nXXVII. Aratus made many attempts, both by intrigues and open violence,\r\nto overthrow Aristippus, and take Argos. Once he succeeded in placing\r\nscaling-ladders against the walls, ascended them recklessly with a few\r\nfollowers, and killed the soldiers who came from within the city to\r\noppose him. Afterwards, when day was breaking and the troops of the\r\ndespot were attacking him on all sides, the people of Argos, just as if\r\nthey were sitting as judges at the Nemean games, and the battle was not\r\nbeing fought on behalf of their liberty, sat by with the utmost\r\ncalmness, like impartial spectators. Aratus fought bravely, and though\r\nwounded in the thigh by a spear, yet succeeded in effecting a lodgement\r\nin the city and in spite of the attacks of the enemy held his ground\r\nuntil nightfall. If he could have found strength to remain and fight\r\nduring the night also, he would not have failed in his attempt; for the\r\ndespot was already making preparations for flight and had sent on much\r\nof his property to the sea-coast: but as no one brought news of this to\r\nAratus, and water failed him, while his wound incapacitated him for any\r\npersonal exertions, he drew off his forces.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. He now gave up this method of attack, and openly invaded the\r\nArgive country with an army and laid it waste. At the river Chares he\r\nfought a desperate battle with Aristippus, and was thought to have given\r\nup the contest too soon, and lost the victory; for when the other part\r\nof his army had decidedly won the day and forced their way a long\r\ndistance forward, he himself, not so much overpowered by the forces\r\nopposed to him as hopeless of success and fearing disaster, lost his\r\npresence of mind, and led his men back into their camp. When the others\r\nreturned from their victorious charge, and complained bitterly that,\r\nafter having routed the enemy, and slain many more men than they\r\nthemselves had lost, Aratus had allowed the vanquished to erect a\r\ntrophy, he was stung to the quick, decided to fight rather than to allow\r\nthe trophy to be erected, and after an interval of one day again led out\r\nhis forces. When, however, he learned that the troops of the despot had\r\nbeen largely reinforced, and were full of confidence, he did not venture\r\nto risk a battle, but made a truce for the recovery of the dead, and\r\nretired. Yet he continued to repair this fault by his diplomatic skill\r\nand persuasive powers, for he won over the city of Kleonæ to the Achæan\r\nleague, and held the Nemean festival at Kleonæ, declaring it to be the\r\nprivilege of its citizens to do so by right of descent. The Argives also\r\ncelebrated the festival, and on this occasion for the first time the\r\nright of safe-conduct of the competitors was violated, for the Achæans\r\nseized and sold for slaves all who passed through their territory on\r\ntheir return from the games at Argos. So stern and inexorable was Aratus\r\nin his hatred of despots.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Shortly after this, hearing that Aristippus was meditating an\r\nattack upon Kleonæ, but feared him, because he was living at Corinth, he\r\nordered an army to be mustered. Bidding his men collect provisions for\r\nseveral days, he marched as far as Kenchreæ, hoping to draw out\r\nAristippus to attack Kleonæ during his absence, as indeed happened.\r\nAristippus at once came from Argos with his entire force; but Aratus\r\nmeanwhile returned by night to Corinth from Kenchreæ, and, having placed\r\nguards upon all the roads, led the Achæans by so swift, well-managed,\r\nand orderly a march, that while it was still dark he not only reached\r\nKleonæ, but drew up his men in order of battle before Aristippus\r\ndiscovered their presence. At daybreak the city gates were thrown open,\r\nand charging with loud shouts to the sound of the trumpet, he at once\r\nrouted the enemy, and pursued in the direction in which he thought\r\nAristippus most probably was fleeing, the country being full of ways to\r\nescape pursuit. The chase was kept up as far as Mykenae, where the\r\ndespot was overtaken and slain by a Cretan named Tragiskus, according to\r\nthe historian Deinias. With him fell more than fifteen hundred of his\r\nmen. Yet, Aratus, after gaining such a brilliant success without losing\r\none of his own soldiers, did not take Argos or restore it to liberty, as\r\nAgias and Aristomachus the younger marched into the town with some\r\nMacedonian troops and seized the government.\r\n\r\nHowever, by this action, Aratus pretty well silenced the ill-natured\r\njoke, which had been made about himself, and the stories, invented by\r\nthe courtiers of despots; for they described the general of the Achæans\r\nas being subject to violent internal disorders during a battle, and said\r\nthat as soon as the trumpeter appeared he became faint and dizzy, and\r\nthat, after having arrayed his forces, given the word, and inquired of\r\nhis lieutenants and officers whether they had any further need of his\r\npresence, when the die was finally cast, he used to retire and await the\r\nresult at a distance. These stories had such an extensive currency, that\r\neven philosophers in their studies when discussing whether violent\r\nbeating of the heart, changing of colour, and the like in time of danger\r\nbe a mark of cowardice or of distemperature and of a cold habit of body,\r\nalways mention Aratus as being a good general, but always being affected\r\nin this manner when in battle.\r\n\r\nXXX. When he had slain Aristippus, he at once began to plot against\r\nLydiades of Megalopolis, who had made himself despot of his native city.\r\nLydiades was naturally of a noble and ambitious nature, and had not,\r\nlike so many despots, been led to commit the crime of enslaving his\r\nfellow-citizens by any selfish desire of money or of pleasure; but when\r\na young man he had become inflamed with a desire of distinguishing\r\nhimself, and listening to all the vain and untrue talk about despotic\r\npower being so fine and happy a thing, he, like a high-spirited youth,\r\nmade himself despot, and soon became overwhelmed with the cares of\r\nstate. As he now both envied the happiness of Aratus and feared the\r\nresults of his plots, he adopted a new and most glorious course, which\r\nwas first to set himself free from hatred and terror and soldiers and\r\nlife-guards, and next to become the benefactor of his country. He sent\r\nfor Aratus, gave up his rule, and united the city to the Achæan league.\r\nThe Achæans admired his conduct in this matter so much that they elected\r\nhim general. He now at once began to strive to outdo Aratus in glory,\r\nand engaged in many unnecessary enterprises, one of which was a campaign\r\nagainst the Lacedæmonians. Aratus opposed him, and was therefore thought\r\nto be jealous of him; yet Lydiades was a second time elected general, in\r\nspite of the open opposition of Aratus, who used all his influence on\r\nbehalf of another candidate. Aratus himself, as has been said, was\r\ngeneral every other year. Lydiades continued in the full tide of success\r\nand was elected general alternately with Aratus up to his third year of\r\noffice; but as he made no secret of his hatred for Aratus, and often\r\nattacked him in the public assembly of the Achæans, they cast him off\r\nand would not listen to him, thinking that his good qualities were but\r\ncounterfeit when compared with the genuine virtues of Aratus. Just as\r\nÆsop tells us in his fables that when the cuckoo asked the little birds\r\nwhy they fled from him, they answered that some day he would be a hawk,\r\nso it seems that, even after he had given up his despotism, some\r\nblighting suspicion always clung to the character of Lydiades.\r\n\r\nXXXI. Aratus gained great glory also in the Ætolian war, because when\r\nthe Achæans were eager to join battle with the Ætolians on the Megarian\r\nfrontier, and Agis the King of Lacedæmon had arrived with a large force\r\nand urged the Achæans to fight, he opposed it, and in spite of being\r\nreproached, abused, and jeered at as a coward, refused to be led astray\r\nby any high-flown ideas of honour from the course which he had decided\r\nupon as the best, made way for the enemy, and without striking a blow\r\npermitted them to cross Geranea and pass into Peloponnesus. When,\r\nhowever, they marched by him and suddenly seized Pellene, he was no\r\nlonger the same man. He would not wait until his entire force was\r\nassembled, but with what troops he had with him at once marched against\r\nthe enemy, who, after their victory, were easily conquered on account of\r\ntheir want of discipline and licentiousness. As soon as they made their\r\nway into the city of Pellene, the soldiers dispersed themselves among\r\nthe various houses, driving each other out of them and fighting one\r\nanother for the plunder, while the chiefs and generals were occupied in\r\ncarrying off the wives and daughters of the citizens. They took off\r\ntheir own helmets and placed them on the heads of these women, in order\r\nthat no one else might take them, but that the owner of each one might\r\nbe known by the helmet which she wore. While they were thus engaged the\r\nnews suddenly came that Aratus was about to attack. A panic took place,\r\nas one might readily expect, with such want of discipline, and before\r\nall of them heard of the danger, the foremost, meeting the Achæans near\r\nthe gates and suburbs of the city, lost heart and fled away at once, and\r\nin their frantic haste threw into disorder those who were forming to\r\ncome to their support.\r\n\r\nXXXII. During this tumult one of the captive women, the daughter of an\r\neminent citizen named Epigethus, who herself was remarkably tall and\r\nhandsome, happened to be sitting in the temple of Artemis, where she had\r\nbeen stationed by the commander of a picked company of soldiers, who had\r\nplaced upon her head his own helmet with its triple plume. She, hearing\r\nthe disturbance, suddenly ran out, and as she stood at the door of the\r\ntemple, looking down upon the combatants, with the triple-plumed helmet\r\nupon her head, she appeared even to her own countrymen to be something\r\nmore glorious than a mere mortal, while the enemy, who imagined that\r\nthey beheld an apparition, were struck with terror and affright, so that\r\nnone of them attempted to offer any resistance. The people of Pellene\r\nthemselves say that the wooden statue of the goddess is never touched\r\nexcept when it is carried out by the priestess, and that then no one\r\ndares to look upon it, but all turn their faces away; for the sight of\r\nit is not only fearful and terrible for mankind, but it even makes the\r\ntrees barren and blights the crops through which it is carried. This it\r\nwas, they say, which the priestess carried out of the temple on this\r\noccasion, and by continually turning the face of the figure towards the\r\nÆtolians, made them frantic and took away their reason. Aratus, however,\r\nin his memoirs makes no mention of anything of the kind, but says that\r\nhe routed the Ætolians, broke into the city together with the fugitives,\r\nand killed seven hundred of them. The exploit became celebrated as one\r\nof his most glorious actions, and the artist Timanthes has painted an\r\nadmirable picture of the battle.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. However, as many nations and princes were combining together\r\nagainst the Achæans, Aratus at once made peace with the Ætolians, and\r\nwith the assistance of Pantaleon, the most powerful man in Ætolia, even\r\nmade an alliance between that country and the Achæans. He was anxious to\r\nset free the Athenians, and was severely reproached by the Achæans\r\nbecause, during a cessation of arms, when they had made a truce with the\r\nMacedonians, he attempted to seize Peiræus. In the memoirs which he has\r\nleft Aratus denies this, and throws the blame of it upon Erginus, with\r\nwhose aid he seized the citadel of Corinth. This man, he says, attacked\r\nPeiræus on his own responsibility, and when the scaling-ladder broke and\r\nhe was forced to fly, frequently called on Aratus by name as though he\r\nwere present, and by this artifice deceived the enemy and escaped. This\r\njustification does not, however, seem a very credible one. There was no\r\nprobability that Erginus, a private man and a Syrian, should have ever\r\nthought of such an enterprise, if he had not been urged to it by Aratus,\r\nwho must have supplied him with the necessary forces and pointed out the\r\nproper opportunity for the attack. And Aratus himself proves this to be\r\ntrue by having not merely twice or thrice, but frequently, like a\r\nrejected lover, made attempts upon Peiræus, and not being disconcerted\r\nby his failures, but ever gathering fresh hopes by observing how nearly\r\nhe had succeeded. On one of these occasions he sprained his leg in a\r\nhasty retreat across the Thriasian plain. Several incisions had to be\r\nmade to cure it, and he was obliged for a long time to be carried in a\r\nlitter when conducting his campaigns.\r\n\r\nXXXIV. When Antigonus died and Demetrius[594] succeeded to the throne,\r\nAratus was more eager than ever to gain over Athens, and began to treat\r\nthe Macedonians with contempt. When he was defeated in a battle which he\r\nfought against Bithys, a general of Demetrius, and many rumours were\r\ncurrent that he had been taken prisoner or had been slain, Diogenes,\r\nthe commander of the garrison of Peiræus, sent a letter to Corinth\r\nbidding the Achæans leave that city now that Aratus was dead. When this\r\nletter arrived Aratus himself was present in Corinth, and the messengers\r\nof Diogenes had to return after having afforded him much amusement. The\r\nKing of Macedonia also sent a ship, on board of which Aratus was to be\r\nbrought back to him in chains. But the Athenians, outdoing themselves in\r\nlevity and servility to the Macedonians, crowned themselves with\r\ngarlands when they heard the news of his death. Enraged at this Aratus\r\nat once invaded their country, and marched as far as the Academy, but\r\nthere he suffered his anger to be appeased, and did no damage. The\r\nAthenians did, nevertheless, appreciate his courage, for when on the\r\ndeath of Demetrius, they attempted to regain their freedom, they invited\r\nhim to assist them. Although Aratus was not at that time general of the\r\nAchæans, and was confined to his bed with a long illness, yet he\r\nresponded to this appeal by proceeding to Athens in a litter, and\r\nprevailed upon Diogenes, the chief of the garrison, to surrender\r\nPeiræus, Munychia, Salamis, and Sunium to the Athenians for the sum of\r\none hundred and fifty talents, twenty of which he himself contributed.\r\nThe states of Ægina, and Hermione now joined the Achæan league, and the\r\ngreater part of Arcadia contributed to it; for the Macedonians were\r\nengaged in wars with their neighbours, and the Achæans, with the help of\r\ntheir allies, the Ætolians, now gained a large accession of force.\r\n\r\nXXXV. Aratus was still true to his original principles, and, grieving at\r\nthe spectacle of a despotism established in the neighbouring state of\r\nArgos, sent to Aristomachus, and endeavoured to persuade him to give up\r\nhis authority, bring the city over to the Achæan league, and imitate\r\nLydiades by becoming the glorious and respected general of so great a\r\npeople rather than remain exposed to constant danger as the hated despot\r\nof one city. Aristomachus acceded to these proposals of Aratus, but\r\nasked him for the sum of fifty talents, for the payment of the\r\nmercenaries whom he was to disband. While the money was being procured,\r\nLydiades, who was still in office as general, and wished to gain the\r\ncredit of this negotiation for himself, told Aristomachus that Aratus\r\nwas really the bitter and implacable foe of all despots, persuaded him\r\nto intrust the management of the affair to himself, and introduced\r\nAristomachus to the Achæan assembly. On this occasion the Achæan\r\nrepresentatives gave Aratus a notable proof of their love and confidence\r\nin him; for when he indignantly opposed the proposition they drove away\r\nAristomachus; and yet, when Aratus had become his friend and again\r\nbrought forward the matter, they readily accepted his proposal, admitted\r\nthe cities of Argos and Phlius into the league, and the following year\r\nelected Aristomachus general. Aristomachus, finding himself cordially\r\nreceived by the Achæans, and wishing to invade Laconia, sent for Aratus\r\nfrom Athens. Aratus replied by a letter in which he dissuaded him from\r\nmaking this campaign, being unwilling to involve the Achæans in\r\nhostilities with Kleomenes, who was a bold general and had already\r\ngained surprising successes. As, however, Aristomachus was determined to\r\nbegin the war, Aratus returned, and made the campaign with him. When\r\nnear Pallantium they met Kleomenes, and Aratus was reproached by\r\nLydiades for restraining Aristomachus from joining battle. The year\r\nafter, Lydiades stood against Aratus as a candidate for the office of\r\ngeneral, when Aratus was chosen general for the twelfth time.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. During this term of office Aratus was defeated by Kleomenes near\r\nMount Lykaeum, and took to flight. He lost his way during the night, and\r\nwas supposed to have fallen. The same rumours now again ran through\r\nGreece about him; but he got safely away, and having rallied his men was\r\nnot satisfied with retiring home unmolested, but making an admirable use\r\nof his opportunity, as no one expected an attack, he suddenly fell upon\r\nthe Mantineans, who were the allies of Kleomenes. He took the city,\r\nplaced a garrison in it, and insisted on the resident foreigners being\r\nadmitted to the franchise, thus alone gaining for the Achæans after a\r\ndefeat, a success which they could hardly have obtained by a victory.\r\nWhen the Lacedæmonians marched against Megalopolis, Aratus came to the\r\nassistance of that city. He would not fight with Kleomenes, though the\r\nlatter endeavoured to entice him into a battle, but he kept back the\r\nmen of Megalopolis who were eager to fight; for he was at no time\r\nwell-fitted for the direction of pitched battles, and on this occasion\r\nwas inferior in numbers, besides being opposed to a young and daring\r\nantagonist, while he himself was past the prime of life, and inclined to\r\nfail in spirit. He thought, too, that while it was right for Kleomenes\r\nto gain glory by daring, it was best for him to be careful to keep the\r\nglory which he had already obtained.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Though the light-armed troops ran out to meet the Spartans,\r\ndrove them back to their camp, and even fought round their tents, yet\r\nAratus would not move on with the heavy-armed force, but halted them\r\nbehind a water-course which he forbade them to cross. Lydiades,\r\nirritated at this, reproached Aratus, called upon the cavalry to follow\r\nhim and reinforce the victorious light troops, and not to lose the\r\nvictory or desert him when he was fighting for his country. Many brave\r\nmen joined him, and with them he charged the right wing of the enemy,\r\noverthrew them, and pursued with reckless ardour until he became\r\nentangled in difficult ground, full of fruit trees and wide ditches,\r\nwhere he was attacked by Kleomenes, and fell fighting bravely in the\r\nnoblest of causes, at the very gates of his native city. His companions\r\nfled back to the main body, where they disordered the ranks of the\r\nhoplites, and brought about the defeat of the entire army. Aratus was\r\ngreatly blamed, because he was thought to have left Lydiades to perish.\r\nThe Achæans angrily retired to Ægium, and forced him to accompany them.\r\nThere they held a meeting, at which it was decided that he should not be\r\nsupplied with any money nor any mercenary troops maintained for him, but\r\nthat if he wished to go to war he must furnish them for himself.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. After being thus disgraced, Aratus determined at once to give\r\nup the seals[595] and lay down his office of general, but after\r\nconsideration he put up with the affront led out the army of the\r\nAchæans, and fought a battle with Megistonous, the step-father of\r\nKleomenes, in which he was victorious, slew three hundred of the enemy,\r\nand took prisoner Megistonous himself. He had hitherto been always\r\nelected general every other year, but now, when the time for his\r\nelection came round, he refused to take the office, although pressed to\r\ndo so, and Timotheus was chosen general. It was thought that his anger\r\nwith the people was merely a pretext for his refusal, and that the real\r\nreason was the perilous situation of the Achæan league; for Kleomenes no\r\nlonger operated against it by slow degrees as before, when he was\r\nembarrassed by the other Spartan magistrates, but now that he had put\r\nthe Ephors to death, redistributed the land, and admitted many of the\r\nresident aliens to the franchise, he found himself an irresponsible\r\nruler at the head of a large force, with which he at once assailed the\r\nAchæans, demanding himself to be acknowledged as their chief. For this\r\nreason Aratus has been blamed for behaving like a pilot during a\r\nterrible storm and tempest yielded up the helm to another when it was\r\nhis duty to stand by it, even against the will of the people, and save\r\nthe commonwealth; or, if he despaired of the Achæans being able to\r\nresist, he ought to have made terms with Kleomenes and not to have\r\nallowed Peloponnesus to fall back into the hands of the uncivilised\r\nMacedonians and be occupied by their troops, and to have garrisoned the\r\ncitadel of Corinth with Illyrian and Gaulish soldiers, thus inviting\r\ninto the cities, under the name of allies, those very men whom he had\r\npassed his life in out-manoeuvring and over-reaching, and whom in his\r\nmemoirs he speaks of with such hatred. Even if Kleomenes were, as some\r\nmight call him, a despot and a law-breaker, yet Sparta was his native\r\ncountry, and the Herakleidæ were his ancestors, and surely any man who\r\nrespected Greek nobility of birth would have chosen the least\r\nillustrious of such a family for his chief rather than the greatest man\r\nin all Macedonia. Moreover, Kleomenes, when he asked the Achæans to\r\nappoint him as their ruler, promised that in return for that title he\r\nwould do great things for them by land and sea, whereas Antigonus, when\r\noffered the title of supreme ruler by land and sea, would not accept it\r\nuntil he received the citadel of Corinth as a bribe, exactly like the\r\nhuntsman in Æsop's fable; for he would not mount upon the backs of the\r\nAchæans, though they begged him to do so, and offered themselves to him\r\nby embassies and decrees, before, by means of his garrison in Corinth\r\nand the hostages which he received, he had, as it were, placed a bit in\r\ntheir mouths.\r\n\r\nAratus makes a laboured defence of his conduct, pleading the necessities\r\nof his situation. Yet Polybius tells us that long before any such\r\nnecessities existed, Aratus had felt alarm at the daring spirit of\r\nKleomenes, and had not only been carrying on secret negotiations with\r\nAntigonus, but even had urged the people of Megalopolis to propose to\r\nthe Achæans that Antigonus should be invited to assist them. It was the\r\npeople of Megalopolis who were the greatest sufferers by the war, as\r\nKleomenes constantly ravaged their territories. The historian Phylarchus\r\ngives a similar account of the transaction, though we could hardly\r\nreceive his narrative with confidence if it were not supported by the\r\ntestimony of Polybius; for he is so enthusiastic an admirer of the\r\ncharacter of Kleomenes that in his history he writes as though he were\r\npleading his cause in a court of justice, and continually disparages\r\nAratus, and, vindicates Kleomenes.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. The Achæans now lost Mantinea, which was recaptured by Kleomenes,\r\nand they were so dispirited by a great defeat, which they sustained near\r\nHekatombæon, as to send at once to Kleomenes, inviting him to come to\r\nArgos and assume the supreme command. Aratus, as soon as he learned\r\nthat Kleomenes had set out, and was marching past Lerna at the head of\r\nhis army, became alarmed, and sent an embassy to him, begging him, to\r\ncome to the Achæans as to friends and allies, with only three hundred\r\nmen, and offering hostages to him, if he suspected them of treachery.\r\nKleomenes regarded this message as a mockery and an insult to himself.\r\nHe immediately retired, after writing a letter to the Achæans in which\r\nhe brought many grave charges against Aratus. Aratus, in turn, wrote\r\nseveral letters to them assailing Kleomenes; and they abused one another\r\nso outrageously as not even to spare the reputation of each other's\r\nwives. After this, Kleomenes sent a herald to declare war against the\r\nAchæans, and very nearly succeeded in making himself master of Sikyon by\r\nthe treachery of some of its citizens. Failing in this, he turned aside,\r\nattacked Pellene, drove out the commander, and took the city. Shortly\r\nafterwards he took Phenes and Penteleum. Upon this the Argives at once\r\njoined him, and the citizens of Phlius admitted a Spartan garrison: so\r\nthat the Achæans seemed to be in danger of losing all their conquests,\r\nand Aratus became seriously alarmed at the disturbed condition of the\r\nPeloponnesus, for he saw that in every quarter cities, encouraged by\r\nrevolutionary agitators, were preparing to throw off their allegiance to\r\nthe league.\r\n\r\nXL. None were quiet or satisfied with things as they were, but many\r\ncitizens of Corinth and of Sikyon itself openly corresponded with\r\nKleomenes, and expressed the disaffection which they had long felt to\r\nthe league, and their wish to obtain the supreme power for themselves.\r\nIn dealing with these persons, Aratus took the law into his own hands\r\nand put to death all Sikyonians whom he found corrupted; but when he\r\nattempted to seek out and punish the Corinthian conspirators, he enraged\r\nthe populace which already was disaffected, and weary of the Achæan\r\ndomination. The people ran together to the temple of Apollo, and sent\r\nfor Aratus, being determined either to kill him or take him prisoner,\r\nbefore they proceeded openly to revolt from the league. Aratus appeared\r\nbefore them, leading his horse, without betraying any suspicion or\r\nalarm, and when many of them leaped up and showered abusive language\r\nupon him, he, with an admirable composure of countenance and manner,\r\nquietly bade them be seated, and not stand up talking loudly and\r\nconfusedly but let in also those who were outside the gates. While\r\nspeaking thus he retired at a foot's pace, as though he were looking for\r\nsome one to take care of his horse. By this means he got away from them\r\nand proceeded on his way, talking unconcernedly to all the Corinthians\r\nwhom he met, whom he bade go to the temple of Apollo, until he came near\r\nto the citadel. Here he sprang upon his horse's back, gave orders to\r\nKleopater, the commander of the garrison, to hold the place stoutly, and\r\nrode away to Sikyon, followed by only thirty soldiers, as the rest had\r\nall remained behind and dispersed.\r\n\r\nAfter a short time the Corinthians discovered that he had taken to\r\nflight, and pursued, but as they could not overtake him, they sent to\r\nKleomenes and delivered up their city to him. Yet Kleomenes considered\r\nthat he had lost more by the escape of Aratus than he had gained by the\r\nacquisition of Corinth. Kleomenes was at once joined by the inhabitants\r\nof the sea-side district known as Akte, who surrendered their cities to\r\nhim, and with their assistance he completely invested the citadel of\r\nCorinth with a rampart and palisade.\r\n\r\nXLI. Aratus was joined at Sikyon by the representatives of most of the\r\ncities of the Achæan league. An assembly was held, at which he was\r\nelected general, with unlimited powers. He now surrounded himself with a\r\nbodyguard selected from among his fellow-citizens. Aratus had conducted\r\nthe affairs of the league for thirty-three years, during which he had\r\nmade himself the first man in Greece, both in power and in renown,\r\nthough now he was utterly ruined and cast down, forced to cling to his\r\nnative city as his only chance of safety amidst the general wreck of his\r\nfortunes. For the Ætolians refused to help him when he implored their\r\naid, and Eurykleides and Mikion held back the Athenians from offering\r\nany assistance, though they were eager to do so out of regard for\r\nAratus. Aratus had a house at Corinth and some property, which Kleomenes\r\nrefused to touch, or to let any one else meddle with, but sent for\r\nAratus's friends and those whom he had left in charge of his property,\r\nand bade them keep everything in good order, as they would have to\r\nanswer to Aratus for their conduct. Kleomenes also sent Tripylus and his\r\nuncle Megistonous to Aratus to negotiate with him, promising him among\r\nmany other advantages a yearly pension of twelve talents, thus\r\nover-bidding Ptolemy by one half: for Ptolemy paid Aratus six talents a\r\nyear. Kleomenes proposed that he himself should receive the title of\r\nchief of the Achæans, and that the citadel of Corinth should be\r\ngarrisoned partly by Achæans and partly by Spartan troops. To this\r\nAratus answered that he was not able to direct events, but rather was\r\ndirected by them. As this language proved that he had no intention of\r\nnegotiating seriously, Kleomenes at once invaded the territory of\r\nSikyon, ravaged the country, and encamped for three months before the\r\nwalls of the city. Aratus remained quiet within the walls, but began to\r\nconsider whether it would be necessary for him to obtain the assistance\r\nof Antigonus by surrendering the citadel of Corinth to him: for his help\r\nwas not to be had on any other terms.\r\n\r\nXLII. The Achæans now assembled at Ægium and invited Aratus thither. The\r\njourney was a dangerous one for him to make, at a time when Kleomenes\r\nwas encamped outside the city of Sikyon; and his fellow-countrymen\r\nendeavoured to keep him back by entreaties and even by threatening that,\r\nwhen the enemy was so close, they would not permit him to leave the\r\ncity; while the women and children hung upon him weeping, as though he\r\nwere the common father and preserver of them all. However, after\r\naddressing a few words of encouragement to them he rode away towards the\r\nsea, accompanied by ten of his friends and by his son, who was now grown\r\nup. At the beach they embarked on board of some vessels which were\r\nriding at anchor, and proceeded by sea to the assembly at Ægium, at\r\nwhich it was decreed that Antigonus should be invited to aid them, and\r\nthat the citadel of Corinth should be handed over to him. Aratus even\r\nsent his son to Antigonus among the other hostages. The Corinthians,\r\ndisgusted with these proceedings, now confiscated his property, and\r\npresented his house to Kleomenes.\r\n\r\nXLIII. Antigonus now approached with his army, which was composed of\r\ntwenty thousand Macedonian foot soldiers, with thirteen hundred cavalry.\r\nAratus, with the chief officers of the Achæan league, proceeded by sea\r\nto Pegæ to meet him, thus avoiding the enemy, although he had no great\r\nconfidence in Antigonus, and distrusted the Macedonians. He felt that he\r\nowed his own greatness to the injuries which he had done them, and that\r\nhis first rise as a politician was due to his hatred of the old\r\nAntigonus. Yet, driven by inexorable necessity, and by the exigencies of\r\nthe times, to which men in authority are really slaves, he took this\r\ndesperate course.\r\n\r\nAntigonus, as soon as he learned that Aratus was approaching, met him,\r\nand welcomed his companions in a friendly manner, but showed him\r\nespecial honour at their first meeting, and as he found upon trial that\r\nAratus was a worthy and sensible man, he contracted closer relations\r\nwith him than those of mere business. Indeed, Aratus was not only useful\r\nto Antigonus for the management of great political negotiations, but\r\nwhen the king was at leisure, proved a more agreeable companion to him\r\nthan any one else. Antigonus, young as he was, perceived that Aratus was\r\nnot spoiled by royal favour, and soon preferred him not only above all\r\nother Achæans, but even beyond his own Macedonian courtiers. Thus was\r\nthe sign which the god had given him in the sacrifice brought to pass:\r\nfor it is said that a short time before this, Aratus was offering\r\nsacrifice and that there appeared in the liver of the victim two gall\r\nbladders enclosed in one caul. The soothsayer explained this to portend\r\nthat Aratus would shortly form an intimate friendship with his greatest\r\nenemy. At the time he disregarded this saying, for he was always more\r\ninclined to follow the dictates of common sense than to be guided by\r\nprophecies and portents. Afterwards, however, as the war proceeded\r\nsuccessfully, Antigonus made a great feast at Corinth to which he\r\ninvited many guests. Among these was Aratus, whom he placed next to\r\nhimself. Presently he sent for a wrapper, and asked Aratus if he also\r\ndid not feel chilly. Aratus answered that he was very cold, and\r\nAntigonus then bade him come closer to himself, so that the servants who\r\nbrought the wrapper enveloped them both in it. Then Aratus, remembering\r\nthe portent, burst out laughing, and told the king about the sacrifice\r\nand the prophecy. This, however, happened after the times of which I am\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nXLIV. At Pegæ Aratus and Antigonus each plighted their faith to the\r\nother, and then at once marched against the enemy. Before Corinth\r\nseveral battles took place, for Kleomenes was securely entrenched there,\r\nand the Corinthians vigorously assisted him. But now one Aristoteles of\r\nArgos, a friend of Aratus, sent secretly to him to say that he could\r\ncause that city to revolt from Kleomenes, if Aratus would appear before\r\nit with some Macedonian soldiers. Aratus laid the matter before\r\nAntigonus, and hurriedly crossed over to Epidaurus by sea with a force\r\nof fifteen hundred men. The Argives rose in revolt before his arrival,\r\nattacked the troops of Kleomenes, and drove them to take refuge in the\r\ncitadel; and Kleomenes, hearing of this, and fearing that if the enemy\r\nmade themselves masters of Argos they might cut off his retreat,\r\nabandoned Corinth and marched by night to help the garrison of Argos. He\r\narrived there before Aratus, and won a partial success, but soon\r\nafterwards, as Aratus was marching to attack him, and King Antigonus was\r\ncoming on behind Aratus, he retired to Mantinea. Upon this all the\r\ncities of Peloponnesus again joined the Achæans, and Antigonus received\r\nthe citadel of Corinth. The people of Argos now elected Aratus their\r\ncommander-in-chief, and he persuaded them to make a present to Antigonus\r\nof all the property of their late despots and of all traitors.\r\nAristomachus was put to the torture at Cenchreae and then drowned in the\r\nsea, a proceeding which brought great discredit upon Aratus for having\r\nallowed a man of considerable merit, with whom he had formerly been\r\nintimately connected, and whom he had persuaded to abdicate his throne\r\nand bring over Argos to the league, to be put to death in this cruel and\r\nillegal manner.\r\n\r\nXLV. By this time also many other charges were brought against Aratus by\r\nthe other cities, as, for instance, that the league had given Corinth to\r\nAntigonus just as if it were some obscure village, and that it had\r\npermitted him to sack Orchomenus and place in it a Macedonian garrison;\r\nthat it had passed a decree, that no letter or embassy should be sent to\r\nany other king if Antigonus did not approve of it; that they were forced\r\nto maintain and pay the Macedonians, and that they celebrated religious\r\nservices, processions, and games in honour of Antigonus, in which the\r\nfellow-citizens of Aratus took the lead, and invited him into their city\r\nwhere he was the guest of Aratus. All blamed Aratus for this, not\r\nconsidering that he had given over the reins to Antigonus, and was now\r\ncompelled to follow his lead, having no longer anything except his\r\ntongue which he could call his own, and not daring to use even that with\r\nentire freedom. It was clear that much of what was being done distressed\r\nAratus, as for instance the affair of the statues; for Antigonus\r\nrestored the statues of the despots at Argos which had been thrown\r\ndown, and threw down all the statues of the captors of the citadel of\r\nCorinth, except only that of Aratus himself: and that, too, although\r\nAratus begged him earnestly to spare those of the others. At Mantinea,\r\ntoo, the behaviour of the Achæans was repugnant to Hellenic patriotism,\r\nfor having by the help of Antigonus captured that city, they put to\r\ndeath all the leading men, and of the rest they sold some and sent\r\nothers to Macedonia loaded with fetters, while they made slaves of the\r\nwomen and children. Of the proceeds of the sale they divided one-third\r\namong themselves, and gave two-thirds to the Macedonians. Yet this can\r\nbe justified by the law of revenge; for though it is a shocking thing to\r\ndeal so cruelly with men of one's own nation, through anger, still, in\r\ngreat political crises, revenge is sweet and not bitter, and in the\r\nwords of Simonides, soothes and relieves the angry spirit. But what\r\nhappened afterwards cannot be thought honourable to Aratus, nor can it\r\nbe attributed to political exigencies: for when the city was presented\r\nby Antigonus to the Achæans, and they decided upon colonising it, Aratus\r\nbeing chosen as its founder, and being at the time general of the\r\nAchæans, decreed that it should no longer be called Mantinea, but\r\nAntigoneia, which remains its name to this day. Thus, by his means, the\r\nlovely Mantinea, as Homer calls it,[596] was wiped out of the map of\r\nGreece, and there remains in its stead a city whose name recalls its\r\ndestroyer and the murderer of its citizens.\r\n\r\nXLVI. Subsequently to this, Kleomenes was defeated in a great battle at\r\nSellasia, left Sparta and sailed to Egypt. Antigonus, after showing\r\nevery kindness to Aratus, returned to Macedonia, where, as he already\r\nwas suffering from the illness which caused his death, he sent the heir\r\nto his kingdom, Philip, who was now a mere lad, into Peloponnesus,\r\nadvising him to pay the greatest attentions to Aratus, and through him\r\nto negotiate with the cities, and make the acquaintance of the Achæans.\r\nAratus welcomed Philip, and so treated him that he returned to Macedonia\r\nfull of good will towards himself, and full of generous feelings and\r\nimpulses towards the Greeks.\r\n\r\nXLVII. When Antigonus died, the Ætolians, who regarded the Achæans with\r\ncontempt because of their cowardice (for indeed they had become\r\naccustomed to be protected by others, and trusting, entirely to the\r\nMacedonian arms, had fallen into a condition of complete indolence and\r\nwant of discipline), began to interfere in the politics of the\r\nPeloponnesus. During their invasion they incidentally plundered the\r\nterritory of Patræ and Dyme, and then marched into the country of\r\nMessenia and began to lay it waste. Aratus, distressed at this, and\r\nseeing that Timoxenus, the general of the Achæans, was acting slowly and\r\nwithout spirit because his year of office had almost expired,\r\nanticipated his own election as general by five days, in order to assist\r\nthe Messenians. He assembled an Achæan army: but the men were without\r\nmilitary training and were destitute of warlike spirit. This army was\r\ndefeated in a battle near Kaphyæ, and Aratus, who was reproached with\r\nhaving been too rash a general, now fell into the opposite extreme, and\r\nshowed such apathy as often to refuse to seize opportunities for attack\r\nwhich were offered by the Ætolians, and to permit them to riot through\r\nPeloponnesus with every kind of wanton insult. Now, a second time, the\r\nAchæans stretched forth their hands towards Macedonia and brought Philip\r\nto interfere in the affairs of Greece. They were the more willing to\r\ntake this step because they knew the regard which Philip felt for\r\nAratus, and the trust which he placed in him, and they hoped that they\r\nshould find him gentle and manageable in all respects.\r\n\r\nXLVIII. At first the king, influenced by the slanders of Apelles,\r\nMegaleas, and some other of his courtiers against Aratus encouraged\r\nthose of the opposite faction, and eagerly pressed for the election of\r\nEperatus as general of the league. However, as he was utterly despised\r\nby the Achæans, and as nothing useful could be effected while Aratus was\r\nout of office, Philip perceived that he had made a complete mistake. He\r\nnow came entirely over to the side of Aratus, and acted entirely at his\r\ndictation. As he was now gaining both renown and power, he attached\r\nhimself more and more to Aratus, imagining that it was by his means that\r\nhe gained his successes. Indeed it began to be thought that Aratus was\r\nable to school kings as well as he could free cities; for the impress of\r\nhis character was to be traced in every one of Philip's acts. Thus the\r\nlenity with which the young prince treated the Lacedæmonians after they\r\nhad offended him, his personal interviews with the Cretans, by means of\r\nwhich he gained possession of the whole island in a few days, and his\r\nbrilliantly successful campaign against the Ætolians, all gained for\r\nAratus the credit of giving good advice, and for Philip that of knowing\r\nhow to follow it. All this made Philip's courtiers more and more jealous\r\nof Aratus. As they could effect nothing against him by secret intrigues,\r\nthey proceeded to open abuse, and assailed him at wine-parties with the\r\nmost scurrilous impertinence, and once when he was retiring to his tent\r\nafter dinner they even sent a shower of stones after him. Philip was\r\nvery indignant at these proceedings, and at once imposed upon them a\r\nfine of twenty talents. Afterwards, as they were embroiling and\r\ntroubling his affairs by their intrigues, he had them all put to death.\r\n\r\nXLIX. Now that Philip was borne along upon the full tide of success, he\r\ndeveloped many vehement lusts, and the natural wickedness of his nature\r\nbroke through all the artificial restraints by which it had been\r\nhitherto held in check, and gradually revealed him in his true colours.\r\nHis first act was to seduce the wife of the younger Aratus. This\r\nintrigue he carried on for a long time unsuspected, as he lived in their\r\nhouse and was treated as an honoured guest. Next, he began to treat the\r\nGreeks in a much harsher fashion, and evidently intended to rid himself\r\nof Aratus. His conduct at Messene first gave rise to this suspicion. The\r\nMessenians revolted, and Aratus marched to attack them, but Philip\r\nreached Messene one day before him, and when he entered the city stirred\r\nup the passions of the citizens by asking the aristocracy of the\r\nMessenians in private whether they had no laws to keep down the\r\npopulace, and then again in private inquiring of the leaders of the\r\npeople whether they had no hands wherewith to quell despots. After this\r\nthe chief men took heart and fell upon the popular leaders, but they,\r\nwith the assistance of the people, killed all the magistrates and nearly\r\ntwo hundred of the other leading citizens.\r\n\r\nL. After Philip had thus wickedly exasperated the Messenians against one\r\nanother, Aratus arrived. He made no secret of his distress at what had\r\nhappened, and did not restrain his son when he bitterly reproached and\r\nabused Philip. The young man was thought to have been Philip's lover;\r\nand he now told Philip that after such deeds he did not any longer think\r\nhim handsome, but hideous. Philip made no answer, although he was\r\nthought likely to do so, as he often had burst into a fury when thus\r\nspoken to, but, just as though he had patiently endured the reproof and\r\nwas really of a moderate and statesmanlike disposition, he took the\r\nelder Aratus by the hand, led him out of the theatre, and proceeded with\r\nhim as far as the summit of Ithome, to sacrifice to Zeus and to view the\r\nplace, which is naturally as strong as the citadel of Corinth, and if\r\ngarrisoned would become a thorn in the side of the neighbouring states,\r\nand quite impregnable. After mounting the hill and offering sacrifice,\r\nwhen the soothsayer brought him the entrails of the ox, he, taking them\r\ninto his own hands, kept showing them first to Aratus and then to\r\nDemetrius of Pharos, alternately placing them before each, and asking\r\nwhat they thought was the meaning of the entrails, that he would keep\r\npossession of the citadel, or that he would restore it to the\r\nMessenians. At this Demetrius laughed and said, \"If you have the soul of\r\na soothsayer, you will give up the place; but if you have that of a\r\nking, you will clutch the ox by both horns,\" alluding to Peloponnesus,\r\nwhich, if he held the citadels of Messene and of Corinth, would be quite\r\ntame and at his mercy.\r\n\r\nAratus remained silent for a long while, but when Philip begged him to\r\nsay what he thought, he answered, \"My king, there are many high\r\nmountains in Crete, and there are many strong positions in Boeotia and\r\nPhokis. I believe too, that there are many places of surprising strength\r\nin Acarnania, both on the sea coast and inland, yet you have not taken\r\nany of these, and nevertheless the people of those countries willingly\r\nexecute your commands. Brigands cling to high cliffs and haunt\r\nprecipitous places, but kings find nothing so secure as loyalty and\r\ngoodwill. This it is that opened to you the Cretan sea, and the\r\nPeloponnesus. By these arts you, young as you are, have made yourself\r\nthe master of the one, and the leader of the other.\" While Aratus was\r\nyet speaking Philip gave back the entrails to the soothsayer, and,\r\ntaking Aratus by the hand, said, \"Come now, let us go back again,\"\r\nhaving been, as it were, overruled by him into letting the city remain\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nLI. Aratus now began to withdraw himself from the court, and by degrees\r\nto break off his intimacy with Philip. When Philip conveyed his army\r\nacross the Corinthian gulf into Epirus,[597] and desired Aratus to make\r\nthe campaign with him, Aratus refused and remained at home, fearing that\r\nhe might share the disgrace of Philip's operations. Philip, after his\r\nfleet had been ignominiously destroyed by the Romans, and his whole\r\nenterprise had failed,[598] returned to Peloponnesus, and, as he did not\r\nsucceed in a second attempt to outwit the Messenians and to gain\r\npossession of their citadel, he threw off the mask and openly wronged\r\nthem by ravaging their territory. Aratus now became quite estranged from\r\nhim, and was misrepresented to him. He had by this time learned the\r\ndomestic dishonour which he had sustained from Philip, and grieved over\r\nit, though he kept it secret from his son; for when he had discovered\r\nit, he was powerless to avenge it. Indeed Philip's character seems to\r\nhave undergone a very great and remarkable change, as from a mild ruler\r\nand a modest youth he grew into a profligate man and an atrocious\r\ntyrant. This change was not due to any alteration of his real nature,\r\nbut to the fact that he could now with impunity indulge the vices which\r\nfear had hitherto forced him to conceal.\r\n\r\nLII. His treatment of Aratus showed that he had always regarded him with\r\na mixture of respect and fear; for though he desired to make away with\r\nhim, and considered that during Aratus's lifetime he should not even be\r\na free man, much less a despot or king, yet he would not openly attack\r\nhim, but bade Taurion, one of his generals and friends, to do this\r\nsecretly, by poison if possible, during his own absence. This man gained\r\nthe confidence of Aratus, and administered drugs to him, whose action\r\nwas not quick and sudden, but which produced slight heats in the body\r\nand a chronic cough, and so gradually undermined his strength. He did\r\nnot, however, do this without being discovered by Aratus; but he, as he\r\ncould gain nothing by convicting him, continued to endure his malady\r\njust as if it were some ordinary disorder. Only once when he spat blood,\r\nand one of his friends who was in the same room noticed it and expressed\r\nhis concern, Aratus said, \"This, Kephalon, is the return I get for my\r\nfriendship for the king.\"\r\n\r\nLIII. Thus died Aratus at Ægium, when holding the office of general of\r\nthe league for the seventeenth time. The Achæans wished his funeral to\r\ntake place in that city, and to raise a suitable monument over so great\r\na man; but the people of Sikyon regarded it as a national misfortune\r\nthat he should not be buried in their city, and prevailed upon the\r\nAchæans to deliver up the body to them. As there was a law which was\r\nregarded with superstitious reverence, forbidding any one to be interred\r\nwithin the walls of Sikyon, they sent ambassadors to Delphi to consult\r\nthe oracle. The Pythia returned the following answer:--\r\n\r\n   \"Dost thou, fair Sikyon, hesitate to raise\r\n    A fitting tomb to thy lost hero's praise?\r\n    Curst be the land, nay, curst the air or wave\r\n    That grudges room for thy Aratus' grave.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this response was brought back all the Achæans were delighted, and\r\nthe Sikyonians in particular, turning their mourning into joy, put on\r\nwhite robes, crowned themselves with garlands, and removed the body of\r\nAratus from Ægium to Sikyon in festal procession with songs and dances.\r\nThey chose a conspicuous spot, and interred him in it with as much\r\nreverence as though he were the founder and saviour of their city. The\r\nplace is called the Arateum to the present day, and on the day upon\r\nwhich he freed the city from its despot, which is the fifth day of the\r\nmonth Daisius, or Anthesterion in the Athenian calendar, a sacrifice,\r\ncalled the thanksgiving for safety, is offered, and also on the day of\r\nthe month on which Aratus was born. The former sacrifice used to be\r\nconducted by the priest of Zeus the Saviour, and the latter by the\r\npriest of Aratus, who wore a headband, not all white, but mixed with\r\npurple. Songs used to be chanted to the music of the harp by the actors,\r\ncalled the servants of Dionysius, and the president of the gymnasiums\r\ntook part in the procession, leading the boys and young men, after whom,\r\nfollowed the council of the city, crowned with flowers, and any of the\r\ncitizens who wished to do so. Some traces of these proceedings still\r\nsurvive, as religious ceremonies; but the most part of the honours paid\r\nto Aratus have died out through lapse of time and change of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nLIV. This is the account which history gives us of the life and\r\ncharacter of the elder Aratus. As for his son, Philip, who was naturally\r\na villain, and whose disposition combined insolence with cruelty,\r\nadministered drugs to him, which were not deadly, but which deprived him\r\nof his reason; so that he conceived a passion for monstrous lusts and\r\nshameful debaucheries, by which he was soon so worn out that, although\r\nhe was in the flower of his age, death appeared to him to be a release\r\nfrom sufferings rather than a misfortune. Yet Zeus, the patron of\r\nhospitality and of friendship, exacted a notable penalty from Philip for\r\nhis wickedness, and pursued him throughout his life: for he was utterly\r\ndefeated by the Romans, and forced to surrender at discretion to them.\r\nHe lost all his empire, was obliged to deliver up all his fleet, except\r\nfive ships, had to pay a thousand talents and give up his own son as a\r\nhostage, and then only was allowed, by the pity of his conquerors to\r\nkeep Macedonia itself and its dependencies. As he always put to death\r\nall the leading men of his kingdom, and all his nearest relations, he\r\ninspired the whole country with terror and hatred. Amidst all his\r\nmiseries he had one piece of good fortune, in having a son of remarkable\r\npromise, and him he put to death out of jealousy and envy at the honours\r\nwhich were paid him by the Romans. He left his kingdom to his other son\r\nPerseus, who was said not to be legitimate, but to be the son of a\r\nsempstress named Gnathæna. Over him Paulus Æmilius triumphed, and so put\r\nan end to the dynasty of Antigonus. However, the family of Aratus\r\nsurvived in Sikyon and Pellene down to my own times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF GALBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Athenian general Iphikrates thought that a mercenary soldier\r\nought to be fond both of money and pleasure, as in that case he would\r\nrisk his life the more freely to obtain the means of procuring\r\nenjoyment. Most persons, however, are of opinion that an army, like a\r\nhealthy body, should receive no impulses save from its head. Thus we are\r\ntold that Paulus Æmilius, when he assumed the command of the army in\r\nMacedonia, and found that the soldiers did nothing but talk and meddle,\r\nas though each man were a general, gave them orders to keep their hands\r\nready and their swords sharp, and leave the rest to him. And Plato\r\nlikewise, seeing that a good general is useless without a disciplined\r\nand united army, thought that soldiers should be mild and gentle, as\r\nwell as spirited and energetic, because those who know how to obey\r\nrequire a noble nature and a philosophic training as much as those who\r\nknow how to command. The events which took place at Rome after Nero's\r\ndeath prove most conclusively that nothing is more terrible than a\r\nmilitary force which is guided only by its own blind and ignorant\r\nimpulses. Demades, when he saw the disorderly and senseless movements of\r\nthe Macedonian army after the death of Alexander, compared it to the\r\nCyclops after he had been blinded; but the state of the Roman Empire\r\nresembled the fabled rebellion of the Titans, as it was torn asunder\r\ninto several portions, which afterwards fought with one another, not so\r\nmuch because of the ambition of those who were proclaimed emperors, as\r\nthrough the avarice and licentiousness of the soldiers, who made use of\r\none emperor to drive out another, just as one nail drives out another.\r\nWhen Alexander of Pheræ was assassinated, after reigning in Thessaly\r\nfor ten months, Dionysius, sneering at the shortness of his reign,\r\ncalled him a mere tragedy king; but the palace of the Cæsars in a\r\nshorter time than this saw four emperors, for the soldiers brought one\r\nin and drove another out, as if they were actors on a stage. The only\r\nconsolation which the unhappy Romans enjoyed was that the authors of\r\ntheir miseries required no avenger to destroy them, for they fell by one\r\nanother's hands, and first of all, and most justly, perished the man who\r\nhad seduced the army into expecting such great things from a change of\r\nCæsars, and who brought dishonour upon a glorious action, the\r\ndethronement of Nero, by bribing men to do it as though it were a\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nII. Nymphidius Sabinus, who, as has been related, was together with\r\nTigellinus, Præfect of the Prætorian Guard,[599] when Nero's cause was\r\nquite hopeless, and he was evidently preparing to escape to Egypt,\r\npersuaded the soldiers to salute Galba as emperor, as though Nero were\r\nalready gone. He promised to each of the prætorians, or household\r\ntroops, seven thousand five hundred drachmas, and to each of the\r\nlegionary soldiers serving in the provinces twelve hundred and fifty\r\ndrachmæ; a sum which it would have been impossible to collect without\r\ninflicting ten thousand-fold more misery on mankind than Nero himself\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nThis offer at once caused the downfall of Nero, and soon afterwards that\r\nof Galba; for the soldiery deserted Nero in hopes of receiving the\r\nmoney, and murdered Galba because they did not receive it. After this\r\nthey sought so eagerly for some one who would give them as much, that\r\nbefore they obtained the hoped-for bribe, their own treasons and\r\nrebellions proved their ruin. To relate each event exactly as it\r\nhappened belongs more properly to the professed historian; yet, those\r\nwords and deeds of the Cæsars which are worthy of record ought not to be\r\npassed over even by an essayist like myself.\r\n\r\nIII. It is generally agreed that Servius Sulpicius Galba was the richest\r\nprivate person who ever was raised to the throne of the Cæsars. Though\r\nillustrious by birth, being descended from the noble family of the\r\nServii, he prided himself even more upon his relationship with\r\nCatulus,[600] who, though he shrank from taking any active part in\r\npolitics, was yet one of the most virtuous and eminent men of the time.\r\nGalba was likewise related to Livia, the wife of Augustus, and by her\r\ninfluence he had been raised from the post which he held in the palace\r\nto the office of consul. He is said to have ably commanded the army in\r\nGermany, and to have gained especial praise by his conduct as proconsul\r\nin Libya. But when he became emperor, his simple and inexpensive mode of\r\nlife was thought to be sheer meanness, while his ideas of discipline and\r\nsobriety appeared obsolete and ridiculous. Nero, before he had learned\r\nto fear the most eminent of the Romans, had appointed Galba to a command\r\nin Spain. Indeed, besides the mildness of his character, it was thought\r\nthat his advanced age was a guarantee against his engaging in any rash\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIV. While Galba was in Spain, the procurators of the emperor treated the\r\nprovincials with the greatest harshness and cruelty. Galba could not\r\nafford them any assistance, but he made no secret of his sympathy with\r\nthem and sorrow at their wrongs, and thus afforded them some relief\r\nwhile they were being condemned unjustly and sold into slavery. Many\r\nscurrilous songs also were written about Nero and sung and circulated\r\neverywhere, and as Galba did not discourage this, and did not share the\r\nindignation of the procurators, he became even more endeared to the\r\nnatives, with whom he was already intimately acquainted, as he was now\r\nin the eighth year of his command, during which Junius Vindex, who\r\ncommanded the army in Gaul, revolted.\r\n\r\nIt is said that before Vindex committed any overt act of rebellion he\r\nwrote to Galba, and that Galba neither agreed to his proposals nor yet\r\ndenounced him, as some other generals did; for many of them sent\r\nVindex's letters to Nero, and as far as they were able ruined his cause.\r\nYet these men afterwards became traitors, and so proved that they could\r\nbetray themselves as well as Vindex. When, however, Vindex openly raised\r\nthe standard of revolt, and called upon Galba to accept the offer of\r\nempire, and constitute himself the head of a strong body--namely, the\r\ntroops in Gaul, a hundred thousand armed men, and many times more men\r\ncapable of bearing arms--Galba called a council of his friends. Some of\r\nthem advised him to temporise, and watch the progress of events at Rome;\r\nbut Titus Vinius, the captain of the prætorian cohort, said, \"Galba, why\r\ndo you hesitate? for you cannot remain quiet, and yet think of remaining\r\nfaithful to Nero. If Nero is to be your foe, you must not refuse the\r\nproffered alliance of Vindex, or else you must at once denounce him and\r\nattack him, because he wishes the Romans to have you for their chief\r\nrather than Nero for their tyrant.\"\r\n\r\nV. After this, Galba by an edict appointed a day upon which he would\r\ngrant manumission to whoever might wish it, and rumour and gossip drew\r\ntogether on that day a great multitude of people eager for revolution.\r\nNo sooner did Galba appear upon the tribune than all with one voice\r\nsaluted him as emperor. Galba did not at once accept this title, but\r\nspoke in disparagement of Nero, deplored the best citizens of Rome who\r\nhad been murdered by him, and promised that he would watch over his\r\ncountry to the best of his power, not as Cæsar or Emperor, but merely as\r\nthe general of the Senate and people of Rome. That Vindex acted justly\r\nand on due reflection when he offered the empire to Galba, is proved by\r\nthe conduct of Nero himself; for though he affected to despise Vindex\r\nand to regard Gaul as of no importance, yet as soon as he heard of\r\nGalba's rising, which was when he was at breakfast after his bath, he\r\noverturned the table. However, as the Senate declared Galba a public\r\nenemy, Nero, wishing to show his courage and to jest with his friends,\r\nsaid that this gave him a good pretext for raising the money of which he\r\nstood in need; for when he had conquered the Gauls he would sell their\r\nspoils by public auction, and in the meantime he could at once\r\nconfiscate the estate of Galba, as he had been declared a public enemy.\r\nNero, after this, ordered Galba's property to be sold, and Galba, when\r\nhe heard of this, ordered all Nero's property in Spain to be put up to\r\nauction and found people much more ready to purchase it.\r\n\r\nVI. Many now revolted from Nero, and all these, as might be expected,\r\ndeclared for Galba, with the exception of Clodius Macer, in Africa, and\r\nVirginius Rufus[601] who commanded the German army in Gaul, who each\r\nacted for themselves, though for different reasons. Clodius, who had\r\nplundered his province, and put many men to death from cruelty and\r\ncovetousness, hesitated, because he could neither continue to hold his\r\ncommand nor yet give it up with safety. Virginius on the other hand, who\r\nwas at the head of the most powerful force in the empire, and who was\r\nconstantly saluted as emperor by his soldiers and urged to assume the\r\npurple, declared that he would neither become emperor himself nor yet\r\nallow any one else to do so without the consent of the Senate. Galba was\r\nat first much disturbed at this. Soon the two armies of Vindex and\r\nVirginius, like horses that have taken the bit between their teeth,\r\nfought a severe battle with one another. After two thousand Gauls had\r\nfallen, Vindex committed suicide; and a rumour became prevalent that\r\nafter so signal a victory the whole army would either place Virginius\r\nupon the throne, or would return to their allegiance to Nero. Galba, who\r\nwas now greatly alarmed, wrote to Virginius, begging him to act in\r\nconcert with him, and preserve the empire and liberty of the Romans.\r\nMeanwhile he retired with his friends to Colonia, a city of Spain, where\r\nhe occupied himself more in repenting of the steps which he had taken,\r\nand in regretting the loss of his usual life of ease and leisure more\r\nthan in doing anything to further his cause.\r\n\r\nVII. Summer was just beginning, when one evening, shortly before dark,\r\nthere arrived Icelus, one of Galba's freed men, who had travelled from\r\nRome in seven days. Hearing that Galba was retired to rest, he proceeded\r\nat once to his chamber, forced open the door in spite of the resistance\r\nof the attendants, made his way in and told him that while Nero was\r\nstill alive, first the army, and then the people and Senate had declared\r\nGalba emperor: and that shortly afterwards a report was spread of Nero's\r\ndeath. The messenger said that he had not believed this rumour, and that\r\nhe had not left Rome before he had seen the corpse of Nero. This news\r\nvery greatly raised the credit of Galba, and a multitude of men, whose\r\nconfidence in him had been restored by this message, flocked to his\r\ndoors to salute him. Yet the time[602] in which he received the news\r\nseemed incredibly short. But, two days afterwards Titus Vinius arrived\r\nwith several other persons, who brought a detailed account of the\r\nproceedings both of the prætorians and of the Senate. He was at once\r\npromoted to a post of honour; while Icelus was presented with a\r\ngold[603] ring, received the surname of Marcianus, and took the first\r\nplace among the freed men of Galba.\r\n\r\nVIII. Meanwhile at Rome Nymphidius Sabinus, not quietly and by degrees,\r\nbut by one bold stroke, attempted to get all departments of the state\r\ninto his own hands. He pointed out that Galba was an old man who would\r\nscarcely live long enough to be carried to Rome in a litter; and indeed\r\nGalba was in his seventy-third year. The soldiers in the provinces, he\r\ndeclared, had long been his friends, and they now depended on him alone\r\nbecause of the enormous presents which he offered them, which made them\r\nregard him as their benefactor, and Galba as their debtor. Nymphidius\r\nnow at once ordered his colleague Tigellinus to give up his sword, and\r\nentertained all men of consular or prætorian rank at state banquets,\r\nalthough he still invited them in the name of Galba, while he suborned\r\nmany of the prætorian guard to say that they must petition Galba to\r\nappoint Nymphidius as their præfect for life without any colleague. He\r\nwas urged to even more audacious pretensions by the conduct of the\r\nSenate, who added to his fame and power by addressing him as their\r\nbenefactor, by assembling daily to pay their respects to him, and by\r\nrequiring him to propose and to ratify every decree: so that in a short\r\ntime he became an object not only of jealousy but of terror to his\r\nsupporters. When the consuls chose public messengers to carry the\r\ndecrees of the Senate to the emperor, and had given them the sealed\r\ndocuments known as diplomas,[604] at the sight of which the local\r\nauthorities in all towns assist the bearer on his journey by relays of\r\nhorses at each stage. Nymphidius was much vexed at their not having come\r\nto him to affix the seals and to provide messengers from the prætorian\r\nguard, and he is even said to have thought of wreaking his displeasure\r\non the consuls; but when they begged his pardon he forgave them. In\r\norder to win the favour of the people he permitted them to massacre any\r\nof Nero's creatures who fell into their hands: and they killed Spicillus\r\nthe gladiator by throwing him under the statues of Nero when they were\r\nbeing dragged about the Forum; laid Aponius, one of the informers, on\r\nthe ground and drove waggons loaded with stones over his body, and tore\r\nto pieces many other persons, some of whom were perfectly innocent, so\r\nthat Mauriscus, who was justly held to be one of the noblest men in\r\nRome, openly declared in the Senate that he feared they would soon wish\r\nto have Nero back again.\r\n\r\nIX. Nymphidius, who thus began to draw nearer to the object of his\r\nhopes, did not dislike being called the son of Caius Cæsar, who was\r\nemperor after Tiberius. It seems that Caius, when a boy, did have an\r\nintrigue with the mother of Nymphidius, who was a good looking woman,\r\nthe daughter of a hired sempstress and of one Callisto, a freed man of\r\nthe emperor. But it appears that her intrigue with Caius must have\r\ntaken place after the birth of Nymphidius, whose father was generally\r\nsupposed to have been Martianus the gladiator, for whom Nymphidia\r\nconceived a passion because of his renown as a swordsman; and this\r\nbelief was confirmed by the likeness which he bore to the gladiator.\r\nHowever, though he did not deny that Nymphidia was his mother, he\r\nnevertheless boasted that the dethronement of Nero was entirely his own\r\nwork, and, not satisfied with having gained by it both honours and\r\nriches, and the embraces of Sporus, the favourite of Nero, whom he had\r\nfetched away from the funeral pyre of his late master and now treated as\r\nhis wife, calling her Poppæa, he was intriguing to gain the throne for\r\nhimself. He employed several of his friends, among whom were some ladies\r\nof rank and senators, to further his interests in Rome, and sent one\r\nGellianus to Spain to watch the proceedings of Galba.\r\n\r\nX. After Nero's death all went well with Galba, though he still felt\r\nuneasy about Virginius Rufus, who had not declared his intentions, and,\r\nwho, being at the head of a great and warlike army, with the glory of\r\nhaving overthrown Vindex and made himself master of a great part of the\r\nRoman Empire, was not unlikely to listen to the solicitations of those\r\nwho wished him to assume the purple, especially as the whole of Gaul was\r\nin an excited condition and ready to revolt. No name was greater or more\r\nglorious than that of Virginius, who was credited with having saved Rome\r\nboth from a cruel tyranny and from a war with Gaul. He, however,\r\naccording to his original intention, referred the choice of an emperor\r\nto the Senate; though when the death of Nero was known the soldiers\r\nrenewed their solicitation of Virginius to make himself emperor, and one\r\nof the tribunes who attended him in his tent drew his sword, and bade\r\nVirginius choose between the steel and the throne. But when Fabius\r\nValens, the commander of one legion, swore allegiance to Galba, and\r\ndispatches arrived from Rome containing an account of what the Senate\r\nhad decreed, Virginius, though not without difficulty, prevailed upon\r\nhis soldiers to salute Galba as emperor; and when Galba sent Hordeonius\r\nFlaccus to supersede him, he received him as his successor, delivered\r\nup the troops to him, met Galba, who was now on the march for Rome, and\r\njoined him without receiving from him any token either of favour or\r\nresentment. Galba respected Virginius too much to injure him, and Titus\r\nVinius and Galba's other adherents opposed his advancement out of\r\njealousy, though in truth they only assisted the good genius of\r\nVirginius in withdrawing him from the wars and troubles in which all the\r\nother commanders were involved, and enabling him to live in peaceful\r\nretirement to a good old age.\r\n\r\nXI. At Narbo, a city of Gaul,[605] Galba was met by envoys from the\r\nSenate, who greeted him and invited him to show himself as soon as\r\npossible to his people who were eager to behold him. Galba showed the\r\nenvoys every kindness and hospitality, but at his entertainments would\r\nonly use his own plate and other things, though Nymphidius had forwarded\r\nfrom Nero's stores sumptuous services of everything necessary for great\r\nbanquets, and the imperial household servants. By this conduct Galba\r\ngained the reputation of being a magnanimous man, above any ideas of\r\nvulgar ostentation; but Vinius presently told him that this noble and\r\npatriotic simplicity seemed merely an artifice to gain popularity with\r\nthe lower classes, and that it was affectation to behave as though he\r\nwere not worthy of this magnificence. By these arguments Vinius\r\nprevailed upon him to use Nero's riches, and not to shrink from an\r\nimperial extravagance at his banquets. Indeed the old man seemed as\r\nthough by degrees he would come to be altogether ruled by Vinius.\r\n\r\nXII. This Vinius was more passionately fond of money than any one else\r\nof his time, and by no means free from blame in respect of women. When a\r\nyoung man, serving on his first campaign under Calvisius Sabinus, he\r\nintroduced his general's wife, a dissolute woman, into the camp\r\ndisguised as a soldier, and passed the night with her in the general's\r\nheadquarters, which the Romans call the \"Principia.\" For this outrage\r\nCaius Cæsar imprisoned him; but on the death of Caius he was fortunate\r\nenough to obtain his release. Once when dining with the emperor Claudius\r\nhe stole a silver cup. When Claudius heard of it he asked him to dinner\r\non the following day, but when he came ordered the attendants to serve\r\nhim entirely from earthenware, not from silver. Cæsar by this comic\r\npunishment showed that he regarded him as more worthy of ridicule than\r\nof serious anger; but when he had obtained complete control over Galba,\r\nand was the most powerful man in the empire, his passion for money led\r\nhim into acts which partly caused and partly led others to bring about\r\nthe most tragic scenes of sorrow.\r\n\r\nXIII. Nymphidius, as soon as Gellianus, whom he had sent as a spy upon\r\nGalba, was returned, learned from him that Cornelius Laco was appointed\r\npræfect of the palace and of the prætorian guard, but that all real\r\npower was in the hands of Vinius.[606] Gellianus also said that he had\r\nhad no opportunity of meeting Galba, and of conversing privately with\r\nhim. At this news Nymphidius was much alarmed. He assembled the officers\r\nof the prætorians, and addressed them, saying that Galba himself was a\r\nkind and moderate old man, but that he never acted according to his own\r\njudgment and was entirely led astray by Vinius and Laco. \"Before these\r\nmen, therefore,\" he continued, \"insensibly obtain for themselves the\r\nposition and influence which was formerly enjoyed by Tigellinus, it is\r\nour duty to send an embassy from the prætorian guard to our chief, to\r\ninform him that he will be more acceptable to us and more popular if he\r\nremoves these two of his friends from his court.\" As this language was\r\nnot approved, for indeed it seemed a strange and unheard of proceeding,\r\nto lecture an old general upon the choice of his friends, as though he\r\nwere a young boy just appointed to his first command, Nymphidius tried\r\nanother course, and attempted to intimidate Galba by writing letters to\r\nhim, in which he at one time declared that Rome was in an excited and\r\ndisaffected condition, and at another that Clodius Macer had laid an\r\nembargo on the corn-ships in African ports, and that the German legions\r\nwere rising in revolt, and that he heard much the same news about the\r\ntroops in Syria and Judæa. As Galba did not pay much attention to his\r\nletters or attach much credit to the assertions which they contained, he\r\nresolved to make his attempt before Galba's arrival, though Clodius\r\nCelsus of Antioch, who was a sensible man and a faithful friend,\r\ndissuaded him, saying that he did not believe that there was one single\r\nfamily in Rome that would address Nymphidius as Cæsar. Many, however,\r\nscoffed at Galba, and Mithridates of Pontus[607] in particular, sneering\r\nat his bald head and wrinkled face, said that the Romans thought a great\r\ndeal of Galba, now that he was absent, but that when he came they would\r\nthink him a disgrace to the age that called him Cæsar.\r\n\r\nXIV. It was now determined that Nymphidius should be conducted to the\r\ncamp of the prætorians at midnight and there proclaimed emperor. Towards\r\nevening Antonius Honoratus, the first military tribune, assembled the\r\nsoldiers under his command and addressed them, beginning by blaming\r\nhimself and them for having in a short time so often changed their\r\nallegiance, which they had done, not according to any fixed plan, or in\r\norder to choose the best masters, but as though they were driven to\r\ncommit one treason after another by some infatuation sent by the gods.\r\nTheir desertion of Nero was indeed justified by his crimes; but they\r\ncould not accuse Galba of having murdered his mother or his wife; nor\r\ncould they allege that he had ever disgraced the purple by appearing on\r\nthe stage. \"Yet,\" he continued, \"it was not any of these things that\r\nmade us desert Nero, but Nymphidius persuaded us into doing so when Nero\r\nhad already deserted us and fled to Egypt. Shall we then kill Galba as\r\nwell as Nero? Shall we choose the son of Nymphidia for our emperor, and\r\nslay the son of Livia as we slew the son of Agrippina? Or shall we\r\nrather punish this fellow for his crimes, and thus prove ourselves the\r\navengers of Nero, and the faithful guards of Galba?\"\r\n\r\nThis speech of the tribune was agreed to by all his soldiers, who\r\nproceeded to their comrades, and urged them to remain faithful to Galba,\r\nand most of them promised to do so. Soon a shout was raised, either\r\nbecause, according to some writers, Nymphidius believed that the\r\nsoldiers were already calling for him, or else because he wished to be\r\nbeforehand with them and fix them while they were wavering and uncertain\r\nwhom they should follow. Nymphidius came forward in the glare of many\r\ntorches, carrying in his hand a speech written by Cingonius Varro, which\r\nhe had learned by heart and intended to address to the soldiers. When,\r\nhowever, he saw that the gates of the camp were closed, and that the\r\nwalls were covered with armed men, he was alarmed, and, coming up to the\r\ngates, asked what they wanted, and by whose orders they were under arms.\r\nThey all answered with one voice that they looked upon Galba as their\r\nemperor. At this Nymphidius went up to them, applauded their resolution,\r\nand bade his followers do likewise. The soldiers at the gate let him\r\npass in, with a few others. Presently a spear was hurled at him, which\r\nSeptimius caught before him on his shield; but as many now attacked\r\nNymphidius with drawn swords, he ran away, was pursued into a soldier's\r\nroom, and slain there. The corpse was dragged into a public place where\r\na railing was put round it, and it was left exposed to public view the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nXV. When Galba heard how Nymphidius had perished, he ordered such of his\r\naccomplices as had not voluntarily made away with themselves to be put\r\nto death: among whom were Cingonius Varro who wrote the speech, and\r\nMithridates of Pontus. In this Galba was thought to have shown himself\r\nharsh beyond all usage, if not beyond all law, and this execution of men\r\nof rank without a trial[608] was a most unpopular message. Indeed, all\r\nmen had expected a very different kind of rule, for they had been\r\ndeceived, as is usually the case, by the reports spread at the beginning\r\nof Galba's reign. They were still further grieved at the fate of\r\nPetronius Turpilianus, a man of consular rank and a faithful servant of\r\nNero, whom Galba ordered to destroy himself. In Africa Macer had, it is\r\ntrue, been put to death by Trebonianus, and Fonteius in Germany by\r\nFabius Valens, acting under Galba's orders: yet in both these cases he\r\nhad the excuse that he feared, them, as they were in open rebellion\r\nagainst him; but there could be no reason for refusing a trial to\r\nTurpilianus, an old and helpless man, if the emperor had any intention\r\nof carrying out in his acts the moderation of which he spoke in his\r\nproclamations. For all this, therefore, Galba was blamed by the Romans.\r\nWhen on his journey he arrived within five-and-twenty stadia (about\r\nthree English miles) of the city, he met a disorderly mob of\r\nsailors[609] who occupied the entire road. These were the men whom Nero\r\nhad formed into a legion and treated as soldiers. They now wished to\r\nhave their appointment confirmed, and pushed forward towards the emperor\r\nnoisily demanding standards for their legion and quarters to encamp in,\r\ncrowding round him in such disorder that he could neither be seen nor\r\nheard by those citizens who had come out to meet him on his arrival.\r\nWhen he endeavoured to put the matter off, and said that he would give\r\nthem an answer at another time, they, taking his delay to mean a refusal\r\nof their demand, became indignant, and followed him with loud shouts. As\r\nsome of them drew their swords, Galba ordered his cavalry to charge\r\nthem. No resistance was offered, but some were cut down in the act of\r\nturning to flee, and some while they ran. It was thought to be a very\r\nbad omen that Galba should make his entry into the city in the midst of\r\nso much blood and slaughter; but all who had before jeered at him as a\r\nfeeble old man now looked upon him with fear and horror.\r\n\r\nXVI. In the giving of presents Galba wished to show a marked change from\r\nthe profuse liberality of Nero: but he seems to have missed his mark, as\r\nfor example, when Canus, the celebrated flute-player, performed before\r\nhim at dinner, Galba praised his playing and ordered his purse to be\r\nbrought. From this he took several gold pieces and gave them to Canus,\r\ntelling him that the money came from his own pocket, not from the\r\nrevenues of the state. He also demanded the restitution of the\r\nlargesses, which Nero had bestowed on his favourite actors and athletes,\r\nleaving them only a tenth part. As he could scarcely get any part of the\r\nmoney back from them, for the major part being reckless profligates who\r\nlived only for the day's enjoyment, had spent it all, he began to search\r\nout those who had bought anything or received any presents from them,\r\nand obliged them to refund. This investigation caused infinite trouble,\r\nfor it affected so many persons; it covered Galba with disgrace and made\r\nVinius loathed and detested for making the emperor show himself so mean\r\nand pettifogging towards his subjects, while he himself used his power\r\nrecklessly, confiscating and selling every one's property. Hesiod,\r\nindeed, bids us drink deep of--\r\n\r\n   \"The end and the beginning of the cask;\"\r\n\r\nand Vinius, seeing that Galba was old and feeble took his fill of his\r\nfortune, as though it were both beginning and ending.\r\n\r\nXVII. The old emperor received much wrong, first from the bad\r\narrangements made by Vinius, and also because Vinius blamed or defeated\r\nhis best intentions. An instance of this was his punishment of Nero's\r\nfavourites. He did, indeed, put to death many wretches, among whom were\r\nHelius, Polykleitus, Petinus, and Patrobius. The people applauded, and\r\ncried out as these men were being led through the Forum, that the sight\r\nwas a fair one and pleasing to the gods, but that both gods and men\r\ndemanded the punishment of Tigellinus, Nero's tutor and instructor in\r\nwickedness. That worthy, however, had previously attached Vinius to\r\nhimself by a most important pledge.[610] So, they argued, Turpilianus\r\nperished though he had committed no crime except that he remained\r\nfaithful and did not betray a bad master; while the man, who first made\r\nNero unfit to live, and then deserted and betrayed him, was still alive,\r\nan evident example that anything could be obtained from Vinius by those\r\nwho could pay for it. The Roman people, who would have enjoyed no\r\nspectacle so much as that of Tigellinus dragged away to execution, and\r\nwho never ceased to demand his head when they assembled in the theatre\r\nor the circus, were astonished at a proclamation in which the emperor,\r\nafter declaring that Tigellinus was suffering from a wasting disease\r\nand could not live long, begged his people not to urge him to disgrace\r\nhis reign by acts of tyranny and ferocity. In ridicule of the public\r\nexasperation Tigellinus offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the gods\r\nfor the recovery of his health, and prepared a splendid banquet; while\r\nVinius left the table of the emperor after dinner and led his widowed\r\ndaughter to the house of Tigellinus in a riotous procession. Tigellinus\r\nmade her a present of five-and-twenty thousand drachmas, and bade his\r\nchief concubine take off the necklace which she wore, which, was said to\r\nbe worth fifteen thousand drachmas, and put it round his daughter's\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nXVIII. After these outrages Galba received no credit even when he acted\r\nmildly, as for instance, when he granted a remission of tribute and the\r\nRoman franchise to the Gauls who had risen in rebellion under Vindex,\r\nfor it was believed that they had not received these privileges from the\r\nkindness of the emperor, but had bought them from Vinius. Thus the\r\npeople began to dislike the emperor most cordially, but the prætorian\r\nguard, who had not received their looked-for donative, still cherished a\r\nhope that Galba would give them at least as much money as they had been\r\nwont to receive from Nero, if not as much as they had been promised by\r\nNymphidius. When Galba heard of their discontent, he made that remark,\r\nso worthy of a great commander, that \"he was wont to enlist his\r\nsoldiers, not to buy them,\" and this caused the soldiers to hate him\r\nbitterly, for they thought that, besides depriving them of what was\r\ntheir due, he was trying to regulate the conduct of future emperors\r\ntowards them. Yet disaffection at Rome had not hitherto assumed any\r\ndistinct form, for the awe inspired by the presence of Galba acted as a\r\nkind of check upon revolutionary schemes, and men concealed the dislike\r\nwith which they regarded him because they did not see any distinct\r\nopportunity of effecting a change in the government. But the troops in\r\nGermany who had served under Virginius, and who were now commanded by\r\nFlaccus,[611] were elated with pride at the victory which they had won\r\nover Vindex, and as they were given nothing, became quite unmanageable\r\nby their officers. They paid no attention whatever to Flaccus, who,\r\nindeed, besides being quite helpless from his violent attacks of gout,\r\nwas entirely without military experience. Once when the army was\r\nassembled at a public spectacle, and the tribunes and officers offered\r\nprayers, as is usual among the Romans, for the prosperity of the emperor\r\nGalba, the soldiers broke into loud murmurs of dissent, and then, as\r\ntheir chiefs continued the prayers, shouted as a response, \"If he be\r\nworthy.\"\r\n\r\nXIX. Very similar reports to these reached Galba concerning the conduct\r\nof the legions under the command of Tigellinus.[612] The emperor,\r\nfearing that it was not only his age, but his want of children which\r\nbrought him into contempt, now determined to adopt some noble youth as\r\nhis son, and make him heir to the throne. There was one Marcus Otho, a\r\nman of illustrious family, and steeped from childhood in luxury and\r\npleasure beyond most Romans of his time. As Homer calls Alexander the\r\n\"spouse of fair-haired Helen,\" celebrating him for the beauty of his\r\nwife, in default of any noble qualities of his own, so Otho was\r\nnotorious at Rome in consequence of his marriage with Poppæa, with whom\r\nNero fell in love when she was the wife of Crispinus, and, as he had\r\nstill some feelings of respect for his own wife, and feared his mother,\r\nmade use of Otho to obtain her for him. Otho's extravagance made him a\r\nfriend and companion of Nero, who was amused at being reproached by Otho\r\nfor meanness and parsimony. It is said that once Nero scented himself\r\nwith a very costly perfume, and sprinkled a little of it over Otho. On\r\nthe next day Otho entertained Nero, when suddenly a number of gold and\r\nsilver pipes squirted out the same perfume over them both as abundantly\r\nas if it were water. Otho seduced Poppæa for Nero, and prevailed upon\r\nher by holding out hopes of an intrigue with Nero to divorce her husband\r\nand marry him. After she became his wife, he did not like to share her\r\nfavours, but showed great jealousy, at which it is said Poppæa was not\r\noffended, for she used sometimes to exclude Nero even when Otho was\r\nabsent, either because she feared to surfeit him with her society, or\r\naccording to some writers, because she did not wish to marry the\r\nemperor, though she was willing enough to have him for her lover. Otho\r\nran a great risk of losing his life; and it is strange that Nero, who\r\nput to death his own wife and sister for Poppæa's sake, should have\r\nspared Otho.\r\n\r\nXX. But Seneca was Otho's friend, and he persuaded Nero to appoint Otho\r\nto the command of the province of Further Lusitania. Otho gained the\r\nlove and respect of his subjects, although he well knew that his\r\nappointment was merely intended as an honourable exile. When Galba\r\nrevolted, Otho was the first to join him, brought all his silver and\r\ngold plate for Galba to coin into money, and presented him with slaves\r\nwho knew how to wait upon an emperor. In everything he proved his\r\nfidelity to Galba, while he showed a rare capacity for business, and on\r\nthe march to Rome he travelled for days together in the same chariot\r\nwith Galba. During this journey, while he was so familiar with the\r\nemperor, he paid special court to Vinius, both by conversing with him\r\nand by giving him presents, and he firmly established his right to the\r\nsecond place in the emperor's favour by always yielding the first to\r\nVinius. He was more successful than Vinius in avoiding unpopularity, for\r\nhe assisted all petitioners to obtain their demands without taking\r\nbribes from them, and showed himself easy of access and affable to all.\r\nHe took special interest in the common soldiers, and obtained promotion\r\nfor many of them, sometimes by applying directly to the emperor, at\r\nothers by means of Vinius, or of the freedmen, Icelus and\r\nAsiaticus,[613] who were the most powerful personages of the court.\r\nWhenever Otho entertained Galba, he always presented each soldier of the\r\nguard in attendance on the emperor with a gold piece, and thus corrupted\r\nthe army and won their affections for himself while he appeared to be\r\ndoing honour to Galba.\r\n\r\nXXI. Now, when Galba was deliberating about the choice of a successor,\r\nVinius suggested Otho to him. Vinius did not do Otho even this service\r\ngratis, but because he hoped to have him for a son-in-law, for they had\r\nmade a compact that Vinius's daughter should marry Otho if he were\r\nadopted by Galba and declared his successor on the throne. But Galba\r\nalways preferred the good of the state to his own private advantage, and\r\nalways looked, not to what was most pleasant for himself, but to what\r\nwas best for Rome. It seems probable that he would never have chosen\r\nOtho even to be heir to his own estate, for he knew well his\r\nlicentiousness and extravagance and his debts, which amounted to fifty\r\nmillions.[614] Wherefore Galba, after having graciously and in silence\r\nlistened to Vinius, postponed his decision: only he appointed himself\r\nconsul, and Vinius his colleague, and it was supposed that he would name\r\nhis successor at the beginning of the new year. The soldiers eagerly\r\nhoped that this successor would be Otho.\r\n\r\nXXII. While Galba was deliberating and hesitating, the German army broke\r\nout into open rebellion. All the soldiers alike hated Galba for not\r\nhaving given them their promised donative, and the troops in Germany\r\nregarded it as a special insult to themselves, that Virginius Rufus had\r\nbeen so discourteously deprived of his command, that those Gauls who had\r\nfought against them under Vindex had been rewarded, while those who had\r\nnot joined him were punished, and that Galba should show such gratitude\r\nto Vindex and pay him such honour after his death, as though it was\r\nVindex who had made him emperor of the Romans. This kind of language was\r\nbeing openly held in the camp when on the first day of the new\r\nyear,[615] which the Romans call the Calends of January, Flaccus\r\nassembled the army to renew the customary oath of fidelity to the\r\nemperor. The soldiers overthrew and tore down the images of Galba, swore\r\nfealty to the Senate and people of Rome, and then dispersed. After this\r\noutbreak the officers began to fear anarchy among the soldiers as much\r\nas rebellion: and one of them spoke as follows: \"What will become of\r\nus, fellow-soldiers, if we neither remain faithful to our present\r\nemperor nor yet create another, as though we had not merely thrown off\r\nour allegiance to Galba, but refused to obey any master whatever? As for\r\nHordeonius Flaccus we must pass him over, for he is merely a feeble\r\nshadow of Galba; but within one day's march of us there is Vitellius,\r\nthe chief of the army of Lower Germany, whose father was censor and\r\nthrice consul, and who can point to the poverty for which some reproach\r\nhim as a shining proof of honesty and greatness of soul. Come, let us\r\nchoose this man, and show that we know better than the Iberians or\r\nLusitanians how to elect an emperor.\" While some approved, and some\r\nrejected this advice, a standard-bearer stole quietly away and brought\r\nthe news of it to Vitellius, who was entertaining a large company at\r\nsupper. Soon the matter became noised abroad throughout the army, and on\r\nthe following day Fabius Valens, who commanded one legion,[616] rode\r\nover to Vitellius's quarters[617] with a number of horsemen and saluted\r\nhim emperor. It is said that on the previous days he had refused the\r\npurple, and had shrunk from the burden of empire, but that now, excited\r\nby food and wine which he had taken at midday, he came forward and\r\nwillingly heard himself addressed as Germanicus, though he declined the\r\ntitle of Cæsar.[618] The troops under Flaccus now at once forgot their\r\npatriotic oaths of fidelity to the Senate, and swore to obey the emperor\r\nVitellius.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Thus was Vitellius proclaimed emperor in Germany. Galba, when he\r\nheard of the rising there, no longer postponed the choice of his\r\nsuccessor. He knew that some of his friends desired the election of\r\nOtho, and some that of Dolabella; but as he himself approved of neither\r\ncandidate, he suddenly without any warning sent for Piso, the son of\r\nCrassus and Scribonia, who perished under Nero, a young man remarkable\r\nfor his virtues, and especially for the modesty and austerity of his\r\nlife. Galba now at once took this youth to the camp of the prætorian\r\nguard to declare him Cæsar and heir to the empire, though as he left\r\nthe palace he was at once met by evil omens, and when he began to\r\naddress the soldiers and to read aloud a prepared speech it thundered\r\nand lightened so often, and such rain and darkness overshadowed the camp\r\nand the city, that it was impossible to doubt that Heaven did not\r\napprove of the adoption of Piso, and that no good would come of it. The\r\nsoldiers were sulky and scowling, as not even on this occasion was any\r\nlargesse given to them. Piso himself was admired by all who saw him, for\r\nas far as they could judge from his voice and manner he was not\r\nbewildered by his good fortune, although he was not insensible of it,\r\nwhile Otho's countenance bore manifest tokens of the bitterness of his\r\ndisappointment, as he thought that Galba's refusal to appoint him after\r\nhaving chosen him and all but raised him to the throne was a clear proof\r\nof the emperor's dislike and hatred for him. Otho was not without fears\r\nfor the future, and went away full of hatred for Piso, blaming Galba,\r\nand angry with Vinius. The prophets and Chaldæans whom he kept about his\r\nperson would not permit him to give up his hopes, and especially one\r\nPtolemæus,[619] who laid great stress upon a prophecy which he had often\r\nrepeated to him, that Nero would not kill him, but would perish before\r\nhim, and that he should rule over the Romans; for having proved the one\r\npart of his prophecy to be true, this man bade him not despair of the\r\nother part also coming to pass, while he was much encouraged by those\r\nwho came to offer their sympathy, and treated him as an ill-used man:\r\nfor many of the partizans of Nymphidius and Tigellinus, who had once\r\nbeen in positions of honour, and now had been dismissed and were in\r\npoverty, attached themselves to him and urged him to revolt.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Among these were Veturius and Barbius, one of whom was an\r\nadjutant, and the other an orderly of the corps of guides[620] as the\r\nRomans call the scouts and messengers of their armies. Together with\r\nthem a freedman of Otho's, named Onomastus, went about from man to man,\r\nand by bribes and promises induced them to stand by Otho, which they\r\nwere willing enough to do, as they were thoroughly disloyal to Galba and\r\nonly wanted an excuse to desert him. Indeed, a loyal army could not have\r\nbeen corrupted in four days, which was all the interval that elapsed\r\nbetween the adoption of Piso by Galba, and the murder of them both: for\r\nthey perished on the sixth[621] day after, which the Romans call the\r\nsixteenth before the Calends of February. Early in the morning of that\r\nday Galba was offering sacrifice in the palace, accompanied by many of\r\nhis friends. The aruspex, Umbricius, as soon as he took the entrails of\r\nthe victim into his hands and looked at them, said distinctly that they\r\nportended great disturbances, and danger to the emperor from a plot at\r\nheadquarters. Thus was Otho all but delivered up to justice by the hand\r\nof God: for he stood close behind Galba and heard what Umbricius said as\r\nhe pointed to the entrails. He was much alarmed, and turned all manner\r\nof colours through fear, when his freedman Onomastus came up to him and\r\nsaid that the architect was waiting for him at his house. This was the\r\npreconcerted signal of the time when Otho was to meet the soldiers. He,\r\ntherefore, explaining that he had just bought an old house, and wished\r\nto point out its defects to those who had sold it, went away through\r\nwhat is called the house of Tiberius into the Forum, where stands a\r\ngilded column[622] at which all the public roads in Italy terminate.\r\n\r\nXXV. Here they say that he was met and saluted as emperor by the first\r\nof the conspirators, who were not more than three and twenty in number.\r\nThough the luxury and effeminacy in which he lived had not affected his\r\ncourage, for he was a most daring man, yet now his heart failed him. The\r\nothers, however, would not let him draw back, but drew their swords and,\r\nstanding round his litter,[623] ordered it to proceed, while Otho\r\nfrequently urged the bearers to go faster, and often muttered to\r\nhimself, \"I am a lost man;\" for several persons had heard what had\r\npassed, and looked on more in wonder than alarm, because of the small\r\nnumber of the conspirators. While he was being thus carried through the\r\nForum, about as many more men joined him, and then others came up by\r\ntwos and threes. At length they all faced around, and saluted him as\r\nCæsar, brandishing their naked swords. The tribune Martialis, who was on\r\nguard at the camp of the prætorians, is said not to have been in the\r\nplot, but to have been terrified and bewildered at Otho's sudden\r\nappearance, and let him pass in. When he was once within the camp, no\r\none opposed him; for those who did not know what was being done found\r\nthemselves enclosed in small parties of two or three together by the\r\nconspirators, and being thus cut off from one another, followed the\r\nparty of Otho at first through fear, and soon, when the matter was\r\nexplained to them, of their own free will.\r\n\r\nNews of the rising was brought to Galba at the palace while the aruspex\r\nstill held the victim in his hands, so that even those who generally\r\nrefused to believe in the omens drawn from sacrifices were astonished at\r\nthe evident interposition of Heaven. As a crowd of all kinds of persons\r\nnow ran up from the Forum, Vinius and Laco and a few of the emperor's\r\nfreedmen stood round him with drawn swords while Piso went forward and\r\naddressed the soldiers who were on guard at the palace, and Marius\r\nCelsus, a brave man, was sent to assure himself of the fidelity of a\r\ncorps of Illyrians who were quartered in the Portico of Agrippa.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Galba wished to go forth, but Vinius dissuaded him, while Celsus\r\nand Laco urged him to do so, and abused Vinius roundly. At this time a\r\npersistent rumour arose that Otho had been murdered in the camp of the\r\nprætorians; and presently one Julius Atticus, one of the chiefs of the\r\nemperor's guards, came up with his sword drawn, shouting that he had\r\nslain the enemy of Cæsar. Pushing his way through the bystanders, he\r\nshowed Galba his sword, which was covered with blood. Galba looked at\r\nhim, and said, \"Who ordered you to kill him?\" As, however, the man spoke\r\nof his loyalty, and the oath of fealty which he had sworn, and as the\r\ncrowd shouted that he had done well, and clapped their hands, Galba got\r\ninto his litter with the intention of sacrificing to Jupiter and\r\nshowing himself to his subjects. Just as he entered the Forum, like a\r\nchange of wind there came a rumour that Otho was at the head of the\r\nsoldiers. And now, while in that vast crowd some called to Galba to turn\r\nback, and some to go on, some bade him be of good courage and others\r\nwarned him to beware, and the litter was frequently shaken and swayed to\r\nand fro as if it were on a stormy sea, there suddenly appeared a body of\r\nhorsemen, and then some foot-soldiers, who came through the basilica of\r\nPaulus, and loudly shouted to the people to take \"that citizen\" away.\r\nThe populace took to their heels, but did not run away in fear, but\r\nposted themselves on the tops of the porticoes and on the highest parts\r\nof the Forum as though they were spectators at a public show. The civil\r\nwar was begun by Attilius Vergilio,[624] who tore down the image of\r\nGalba which he carried on his staff, and dashed it upon the ground. Many\r\nnow hurled their javelins at the litter; and, missing their aim at Galba\r\nwith these, they drew their swords and rushed upon him. No one remained\r\nwith him or defended him except one man, the only one of all that vast\r\nmultitude whom the sun beheld that day acting worthily of the Roman\r\nEmpire. This was a centurion named Sempronius Densus, who had never\r\nreceived any especial favour from Galba, but who, prompted merely by his\r\nown honour and fidelity, stood firm in front of his litter. Raising the\r\nvine stick, which is carried by centurions to correct their men, he\r\nshouted aloud and ordered the men who rushed towards him to spare the\r\nemperor. After this, as they tried to push past him, he drew his sword\r\nand defended the emperor for a long time, until he was brought to the\r\nground by a blow under the knee.\r\n\r\nXXVII. Galba's litter was overset near the place called the Lake of\r\nCurtius. As he fell to the ground, wearing a corslet,[625] many ran upon\r\nhim and stabbed him. He, offering his throat to them, said \"Strike, if\r\nthis be best for Rome.\" He received many cuts in the legs and arms, but\r\nthe mortal blow in the throat was given, according to the most common\r\naccount, by one Camurius, a soldier of the fifteenth legion. Some\r\nwriters say that his murderer's name was Terentius, some, Lecanius, and\r\nsome Fabius Fabulus, who is said to have cut off his head and carried it\r\naway wrapped in his toga, for being bald, it was difficult to hold with\r\nthe hands. Afterwards, as those who were with him would not allow him to\r\ncarry it so, but wished him to display his feat of arms, he stuck it on\r\na spear, and ran along like a Bacchanal, brandishing aloft the aged head\r\nof one who had been a virtuous emperor, a pontiff, and a consul, often\r\nturning himself about and shaking the spear, down which the blood still\r\nran. When the head of Galba was brought to Otho, he said, \"This is\r\nnothing, my comrades; show me the head of Piso.\" Before long it was\r\nbrought to him: for the youth had been wounded and fled, but had been\r\npursued by one Marcus who slew him near the temple of Vesta. Vinius also\r\nwas killed, though he admitted that he had been a party to the\r\nconspiracy against Galba; for he cried out that \"Otho did not mean him\r\nto be killed.\" However, both his head and that of Laco were cut off and\r\ntaken to Otho, from whom the bearers demanded a present. As Archilochus\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n   \"Though there be of us a thousand, each of whom his man hath slain,\r\n    Yet we find but corpses seven, when we come to search the plain.\"\r\n\r\nSo many who took no part in these murders nevertheless dipped their\r\nhands and their swords in the blood and showed them to Otho, and sent\r\npetitions to him asking for a reward. A hundred and twenty persons were\r\nafterwards discovered to have done this by the written petitions which\r\nthey sent to the emperor, all of whom afterwards Vitellius caused to be\r\nsearched for and put to death. Besides these men, Marius Celsus came to\r\nthe camp. Many at once accused him of having incited the soldiers to\r\nhelp Galba, and the mob clamoured for his execution. Otho, however, did\r\nnot wish to kill him; but as he did not dare to directly oppose the\r\nsoldiers, he said that he would not put him to death in such a hurry,\r\nfor there were several questions which he wished to put to him. On this\r\npretence he ordered him to be imprisoned, and entrusted him to his own\r\nmost faithful followers.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. The Senate was at once called together. Just as though they had\r\nbecome different men, or worshipped different gods, the senators took\r\nthe oath of fealty to Otho, which Otho himself had just broken: and they\r\naddressed him as Cæsar and Augustus while the headless corpses, dressed\r\nin their consular robes, were still lying in the Forum. As the murderers\r\nhad no further use for the heads, they sold that of Vinius to his\r\ndaughter for two thousand five hundred drachmas. Piso's head was given\r\nto his wife Verania,[626] at her earnest entreaty; and that of Galba was\r\ngiven to the slaves of Patrobius[627] and Vitellius, who subjected it to\r\nevery kind of indignity, and at last threw it into the place which is\r\ncalled the Sessorium, where they execute those who are put to death by\r\nthe emperor's orders. Galba's body was removed by Helvidius Priscus,\r\nwith the permission of Otho: and during the night it was buried by one\r\nArgius,[628] the emperor's freedman.\r\n\r\nXXIX. This was the fate of Galba, who was second to few of the Romans in\r\nbirth or wealth, being almost the first man of his time in both. He\r\nlived through the reigns of five emperors and obtained a great\r\nreputation, by which more than by any power at his disposal he drove out\r\nNero: for of the many pretenders of that time some were declared by all\r\nto be unfit to reign, and some of their own accord withdrew their\r\npretensions; but Galba was offered the throne and accepted it, so that\r\nhis mere name caused the rising of Vindex, which had been regarded as a\r\nmere revolt, to be called a civil war, because an emperor took part in\r\nit. As therefore he considered that he had not so much sought for the\r\nmanagement of the empire as he had had it pressed upon him, he thought\r\nto govern the spoiled children of Nymphidius and Tigellinus after the\r\nfashion of Scipio, Fabricius, and Camillus of old.\r\n\r\nThough his faculties were somewhat impaired by age he proved himself in\r\nall military matters a thoroughly capable commander of the old school;\r\nbut he put himself entirely into the hands of Vinius and Laco, who, just\r\nlike the greedy crew that had surrounded Nero, sold everything in the\r\nstate to the highest bidder; so that no one looked back with regret to\r\nhis reign, though many were grieved at his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF OTHO.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The young emperor[629] proceeded at daybreak to the Capitol, and offered\r\nsacrifice there. Next, he ordered Marius Celsus to be brought to him,\r\nand having embraced him, spoke kindly to him, and invited him to forget\r\nthe charge which had been made against him rather than to remember his\r\nacquittal. Celsus answered with dignity, yet not without appreciation of\r\nOtho's kindness, that the crime laid to his charge, being that of\r\nfidelity to Galba, to whom he owed nothing, ought of itself to bear\r\nwitness to his character. By these words both Otho and Celsus were\r\nthought to have done themselves equal honour, and were applauded by the\r\nsoldiers. After this, Otho made a mild and gracious speech to the\r\nSenate. He assigned part of the time appointed for his own consulship to\r\nVirginius Rufus, and left in force all the other appointments to\r\nconsulships which had been made by Nero or Galba. He gratified several\r\npersons of advanced age, or eminent in other ways, by appointing them to\r\noffices in the priesthood, and restored to those senators who had been\r\nbanished by Nero, and had returned under Galba, all of their property\r\nwhich had not been sold. In consequence of this, many of the leading men\r\nin Rome, who had at first shuddered at Otho's accession, regarding him\r\nas some avenging demon who had suddenly been placed upon the throne,\r\nbegan to look much more hopefully upon a reign by which they themselves\r\nprofited.\r\n\r\nII. At the same time nothing delighted the common people and reconciled\r\nthem to Otho so much as his treatment of Tigellinus. This wretch had\r\nhitherto escaped notice, for all thoughtful men considered him\r\nsufficiently punished already by his fear of the punishment which the\r\npeople demanded as a debt due to the public, and by the incurable bodily\r\ndiseases from which he suffered, while they regarded the foul\r\ndebaucheries which he still even when dying continued to lust after, as\r\na greater misery to him than death itself. Yet many thought it shame\r\nthat he should still see the light of day, of which he had deprived so\r\nmany noble spirits. Otho sent a messenger to the country house near\r\nSinuessa, where Tigellinus dwelt, and where several ships were always\r\nriding at anchor in case he should wish to flee farther from Rome.\r\nTigellinus at first offered the messenger a vast bribe to allow him to\r\nescape; and as the man refused to do so, he gave him the money\r\nnevertheless, begged of him to wait until he had shaved, and then,\r\ntaking up a razor, cut his throat.\r\n\r\nIII. The emperor, though he gratified the people by this well-deserved\r\nexecution, yet bore no malice against any one else of his personal\r\nenemies. To please the people he at first allowed them to address him at\r\npublic spectacles as \"Nero\"; and he allowed several statues of Nero to\r\nbe replaced in public. Claudius Rufus states that the diplomas,[630] or\r\nimperial despatches, which were sent to Spain by the hands of public\r\ncouriers, were inscribed with the name of Nero as well as with that of\r\nOtho. However, as he perceived that this practice gave offence to the\r\nfirst and most powerful citizens, he put a stop to it. The soldiers of\r\nthe prætorian guard were extremely dissatisfied with the moderate manner\r\nin which Otho began his reign, and they warned him to be on his guard,\r\nand cut off all disaffected persons, either out of a genuine anxiety for\r\nhis safety, or merely as a pretext for causing disturbances and civil\r\nwars. One day Otho sent Crispinus[631] to Ostia to bring back the\r\nseventeenth manipulus[632] from thence. As Crispinus, while it was still\r\ndark, began to make preparations for the journey, and loaded waggons\r\nwith the men's arms, some of the most daring soldiers openly declared\r\nthat he had come with disloyal intentions, that the Senate meditated a\r\ncoup d'état, and that the arms were meant to be used against Otho, not\r\nfor him. As many took up this idea and became much excited, some seized\r\non the waggons, others killed Crispinus and their own two centurions who\r\ntried to oppose them, and all, in confusion, calling upon one another to\r\ncome to the rescue of Cæsar, marched to Rome. Hearing that Otho was\r\nentertaining eighty of the senators at dinner, they rushed to the\r\npalace, exclaiming that now was the time to put to death all the enemies\r\nof Cæsar at one stroke. The city was panic-stricken, expecting at once\r\nto be pillaged by the troops; the palace was filled with confusion and\r\nalarm, and Otho himself terribly perplexed as to what to do; for while\r\nhe feared for the safety of his guests, some of whom had brought their\r\nwives to the banquet, they mistrusted him, and he saw them watching his\r\nevery movement in silent terror. He therefore ordered the prefects of\r\nthe guard to go and pacify the soldiers, while at the same time he\r\ndismissed his guests by another door. They were scarcely gone when the\r\nsoldiers burst tumultuously into the dining-hall, asking what had become\r\nof the enemies of Cæsar. Otho now mounted on a couch and addressed them;\r\nand by entreaties, and even by tears, at last prevailed upon them to\r\nretire. On the following day, having presented every soldier with twelve\r\nhundred and fifty drachmas, he entered the camp, where he praised[633]\r\ntheir zeal on his behalf, and begged them to join him in punishing a few\r\nwhose intrigues had made both his clemency and their own steady loyalty\r\nto be questioned. As all approved, and bade him do so, he, after\r\nselecting for punishment two men whose fate no one could regret, left\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nIV. Some of the soldiers believed that Otho's character was really\r\nchanged, and admired him for his conduct; while others bethought that he\r\nwas only courting popularity perforce, because of the war which was\r\nimpending. It was indeed reported that Vitellius had already assumed the\r\nimperial title and authority; and couriers were constantly arriving with\r\nthe news of some fresh accession to his forces, though other messengers\r\ncame who stated that the troops in Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Moesia had,\r\nwith their officers, declared for Otho. Soon also friendly letters\r\nreached him from Mucianus and Vespasianus, the former of whom was at the\r\nhead of a great army in Syria, and the latter in Judæa. Encouraged by\r\nthese, Otho wrote to Vitellius, bidding him act like a loyal soldier,\r\nand promising that he would bestow on him a great sum of money and a\r\ncity in which he might dwell in the utmost peace and happiness.\r\nVitellius replied at first with dissimulation, but soon they became\r\nirritated, and overwhelmed one another with abuse, which each well\r\ndeserved, though it was ridiculous for either of them to reproach the\r\nother with vices which were common to them both.[634] Indeed it was hard\r\nto say which of them was the more profligate or the more effeminate,\r\nwhich had the least experience of war, or which had been plunged the\r\nmore deeply in debt by his former poverty.\r\n\r\nAt this time many prodigies[635] and omens were reported, many of which\r\nwere vague and could not be traced to any trustworthy source, though all\r\nmen saw the reins fall from the hands of the figure of Victory in the\r\ncapitol, who is represented driving a chariot, as though she were no\r\nlonger able to hold them; and the statue of Caius[636] Cæsar, which\r\nstands upon the island in the Tiber, without any wind or earthquake, was\r\nturned round, so as to face east instead of west. This is said to have\r\ntaken place about the time when Vespasianus openly pretended to the\r\nthrone. Many also regarded the flooding of the Tiber as an evil omen;\r\nfor though it was the season of the year at which rivers usually are\r\nfull of water, yet it never rose so high or did so much damage before;\r\nfor it laid a great part of the city under water, especially in the\r\ncorn-market, and caused great scarcity of provisions for several days.\r\n\r\nV. About this time news was brought to Rome that Cæcina and Valens,\r\nacting as the lieutenants of Vitellius, had seized the passes of the\r\nAlps. The prætorians also conceived suspicions of the loyalty of\r\nDolabella,[637] a man of patrician family. Whether Otho feared him or\r\nsome one else is uncertain: however, he assured him of his friendship,\r\nand sent him to reside at the city of Aquinum. Otho now selected the\r\nofficers who were to company him on his campaign. Amongst these was\r\nLucius, the brother of Vitellius, whom he neither promoted nor removed\r\nfrom the rank in the army which he held. He also took especial care of\r\nthe mother and wife of Vitellius, that they might not have any fear for\r\ntheir own safety. He entrusted the government of Rome to Flavius\r\nSabinus, either because he wished to show his respect for Nero (for\r\nSabinus had been appointed to this post by Nero, and had been deprived\r\nof it by Galba), or because by the promotion of Sabinus he declared his\r\ngood will and confidence in Vespasianus. He himself remained at\r\nBrixellum, a city of Italy situated upon the river Padus, and sent on\r\nhis forces under the command of Marius Celsus, Suetonius Paullinus, and\r\nof Gallus and Spurinna, who were all generals of renown, but who, on\r\naccount of the want of discipline of their troops, were unable to\r\nconduct the campaign, according to the plans which they had arranged.\r\nIndeed the soldiers of the guard refused to obey any authority except\r\nthat of the emperor himself, for he alone, they declared, had the right\r\nto command them. Nor were the enemy's troops altogether obedient and\r\nwell-behaved, but the same causes rendered them also swaggering and\r\nuntrustworthy. Yet they possessed experience of actual war, and were\r\naccustomed to fatigue; whereas Otho's troops were weak from their life\r\nof unwarlike leisure, for they spent most of their time in the theatres\r\nand at public shows, or else in their quarters, and affected such a\r\ndegree of insolence that they refused to perform the necessary labours\r\nof a campaign, alleging that to do so was beneath their dignity, not\r\nthat it was beyond their strength. Spurinna, when he endeavoured to\r\nforce them to do their duty, came within a very little of losing his\r\nlife. The soldiers insulted him grossly, and set no bounds to their\r\nlanguage, calling him a traitor to Cæsar and the ruin of his cause. Some\r\nof them actually got drunk and went to Spurinna's tent at night to\r\ndemand money for a journey; for they said they must go and impeach him\r\nbefore Cæsar.\r\n\r\nVI. However, the cause of Otho, and Spurinna with it, received some\r\nadvantage from the abusive language which these same soldiers met with\r\nat Placentia. Here the Vitellians who were besieging the city ridiculed\r\nOtho's men whom they saw on the battlements, calling them stay-at-home\r\nsoldiers, sword-dancers, and spectators of games, declaring that they\r\nhad never seen or tasted of real war, but were full of pride at having\r\ncut off the head of an unarmed old man, meaning Galba, though they dared\r\nnot come out and fight like men. The soldiers were so furiously\r\nexasperated by these reproaches that they eagerly besought Spurinna to\r\nemploy them in whatever service he pleased, assuring him that they would\r\nnot shrink from any toils or dangers. When the enemy furiously assaulted\r\nthe walls, and brought up many battering engines,[638] Spurinna's men\r\nwon the victory, drove back their opponents with great slaughter, and\r\nsaved from ruin one of the most famous and prosperous cities of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe generals of Otho were found both by cities and by individuals to be\r\nmuch less offensive to deal with than those of Vitellius. Among the\r\nlatter was Cæcina, a man who neither spoke nor dressed like a citizen of\r\nRome, but was harsh and overbearing, of great stature, wearing the\r\nGaulish trousers and sleeves, and using signs[639] even when addressing\r\nRoman magistrates. He was accompanied by his wife[640] who rode with him\r\nin a showy dress, escorted by a picked body of cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe other general, Fabius Valens,[641] was so avaricious that neither\r\nthe plunder which he took from the enemy, nor yet the thefts, which he\r\ncommitted or the bribes which he received from the allied states could\r\nsatiate him; and he was even suspected of having been too late for the\r\nfirst battle of the war because he delayed his march to amass wealth for\r\nhimself. Others blame Cæcina, because in his haste to win a victory\r\nbefore Valens came up, he, besides other blunders of less consequence,\r\nbegan a battle so unseasonably and conducted it so remissly that he very\r\nnearly brought the cause of Vitellius to ruin.\r\n\r\nVII. After Cæcina's repulse at Placentia he proceeded to Cremona,\r\nanother large and flourishing city. Meanwhile Annius Gallus, who was on\r\nhis way to Placentia to reinforce Spurinna, hearing while on the march\r\nthat the troops at Placentia had been victorious, but that Cremona was\r\nin danger, changed the direction of his march towards that place, and\r\nencamped close to the enemy. Here Cæcina concealed many foot-soldiers in\r\nrough and wooded ground ordering his cavalry to ride forward and, if\r\nthey fell in with the enemy, to retire little by little so as to draw\r\nthem into the ambuscade. This plan was betrayed to Celsus by deserters.\r\nCelsus attacked them with the best of his cavalry, pursued them with\r\ncaution, taking care to avoid the ambuscade, and then surrounded the\r\ntroops in ambush, and threw them into confusion. He now sent for his\r\ninfantry from the camp: and it was thought that if they had come up\r\npromptly after the cavalry, the whole army of Cæcina might have been\r\ndestroyed; but as it was, Paullinus brought them up slowly and too late,\r\nand tarnished his glory as a general by overcaution. The mass of the\r\nsoldiers charged him with treason, and tried to exasperate Otho against\r\nhim by boasting that they had won the victory, but that their success\r\nwas not followed up owing to the cowardice of their generals. Otho,\r\nthough he did not believe their accusations, yet feared to be thought to\r\ndisbelieve them. He accordingly sent his brother Titianus to the army,\r\nand with him Julius Proculus[642], the prefect of the prætorians, who\r\nvirtually had the supreme command, though Titianus was the nominal\r\nchief, while Celsus and Paullinus were given the titles of counsellors\r\nand friends, but were not allowed the least real power or authority.\r\n\r\nThe enemy also showed want of discipline, especially in the army of\r\nValens. These men, when they heard of the ambuscade and the defeat to\r\nwhich it had led, were greatly enraged at not having been there in time\r\nto prevent so great a slaughter of their friends. Valens[643] was forced\r\nto beg for his life; for the soldiers were preparing to stone him. He\r\npacified them with difficulty, and led them to join the forces of\r\nCæcina.\r\n\r\nVIII. When Otho arrived at the camp at Bedriacum,[644] which is a\r\nvillage near Cremona, he held a council of war. Proculus and Titianus\r\nwere of opinion that, as the troops were full of confidence and flushed\r\nwith victory, it would be best to fight a decisive battle at once, and\r\nnot blunt their spirit by delay, which would also bring Vitellius down\r\nupon them from Gaul. On the other hand Paullinus argued that the enemy\r\nhad already collected their entire available force, whereas Otho might\r\nexpect another army as large as his present one to join him from Moesia\r\nand Pannonia, if he would only wait until it suited him to fight, and\r\nnot play into the hands of the enemy by engaging prematurely. The\r\ntroops, he said, after being so largely reinforced, would be no less\r\nconfident than at present, when they are but few; indeed, they would\r\nfight with a great superiority of numbers. Besides this, delay would be\r\nall in their favour, as they had abundance of supplies, while the\r\nopponents, who were in an enemy's country, would soon be reduced to\r\ngreat straits by the want of provisions. Marius Celsus agreed with the\r\nviews of Paullinus. Annius Gallus was not present at the council, having\r\nbeen disabled by a fall from his horse: but when Otho wrote a letter to\r\nhim, asking his opinion, he advised the emperor not to be hasty, but to\r\nawait the arrival of the legions which were already on their way from\r\nMoesia. However Otho was not convinced by these arguments, but agreed\r\nwith those who urged him to fight at once.\r\n\r\nIX. Many other reasons for this decision are given by various writers,\r\nand it is evident that the prætorians, or bodyguard of the emperor, who\r\nnow for the first time had experience of actual warfare, were eager to\r\nreturn to their old haunts at Rome, and the unwarlike pleasures of the\r\ntheatre and the circus, and that their eagerness for battle could not be\r\nrestrained, as they imagined that they would overthrow their antagonists\r\nat the first onset. It seems, too, that Otho himself could no longer\r\nendure the uncertainty of his position, for his ignorance of war and his\r\nlife of enervating luxury had unfitted him for a calm calculation of his\r\nchances of success, and, worn out as he was with anxiety, he longed to\r\nlet the matter be settled whichever way chance might determine, like a\r\nman who covers his face through dizziness at looking over a precipice.\r\nThis is the account which is given by the orator Secundus, who acted as\r\nprivate secretary to Otho. Other[645] authorities relate that many\r\nefforts were made by the soldiers of both armies to combine, and agree\r\nto elect an emperor from among their own officers: or, if this proved\r\nimpossible, to place the election in the hands of the senate. It seems\r\nindeed rightly probable, considering the ill-repute of both claimants of\r\nthe throne, that the more sedate and thoughtful of the soldiers should\r\nhave reflected that it would be a horrible and shameful thing that the\r\nRomans should be made to suffer for a second time all the miseries which\r\nthey had once endured in the civil wars of Sulla and of Marius and of\r\nCæsar and Pompeius, merely in order to provide an empire to bear the\r\ncharges of the gluttony and drunkenness of Vitellius, or of the luxury\r\nand profligacy of Otho. It is suspected that Marius Celsus, knowing that\r\nthis feeling was gaining ground, endeavoured to gain time, hoping that\r\nthe whole matter might be decided without fighting; and that Otho,\r\nfearing this, hurried on an engagement.\r\n\r\nX. After the council Otho again retired to Brixellum. This was a\r\nmistake, not only because the army would have fought with greater zeal\r\nand discipline when under the eye of the emperor, but because by taking\r\naway the best and most loyal troops, both of cavalry and infantry, to\r\nact as his bodyguard, he made his army like a spear which has lost its\r\nsteel point. At this time a battle took place on the bank of the Padus,\r\nacross which Cæcina endeavoured to throw a bridge, while the Othonians\r\ntried to prevent him from doing so. As they did not succeed in this,\r\nthey threw lighted sulphur and pitch into the boats which formed the\r\nbridge, and a wind suddenly springing up carried the fire across the\r\nstream towards the enemy. At first volumes of smoke, and then a mass of\r\nflames burst out, so that the enemy were thrown into confusion and\r\nforced to leap from the bridge into the river, upsetting the boats and\r\nexposing themselves to the missiles and the ridicule of the enemy.\r\nHowever, the Germans were victorious in a fight with Otho's corps of\r\ngladiators for the possession of an island in the river, and slew many\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nXI. As, after this, the soldiers in Otho's camp at Bedriacum were\r\nfrantically eager for battle, Proculus led them forward about six miles\r\nfrom that place and encamped in such an ignorant and ridiculous fashion\r\nthat the men suffered from want of water, although it was spring time,\r\nand all the surrounding country was full of springs and perennial\r\nstreams. On the next day he wished to lead them at least twelve miles\r\nnearer the enemy, but Suetonius Paullinus would not allow him to do so,\r\nthinking that the soldiers ought to have some rest, and not first be\r\nfatigued with a long march, and then while they were confusedly mixed up\r\nwith baggage animals and camp-followers, be brought to fight against an\r\nenemy who could quietly and deliberately place themselves in order of\r\nbattle. While the generals were at variance, one of the horsemen called\r\nNumidians rode up bearing a letter from Otho, in which he ordered them\r\nnot to waste any time, but to march against the enemy at once. On\r\nreceiving this they started. Cæcina, hearing of their march, was much\r\ndisquieted, abandoned his operations by the river, and proceeded to the\r\ncamp. Here after Valens had got the men under arms, and had given them\r\nthe watchword, he sent forward the best of the cavalry while the legions\r\nwere taking up their respective positions in the line of battle.\r\n\r\nXII. For some reason or other the men of Otho's vanguard conceived an\r\nidea that the generals of Vitellius intended to desert to their side:\r\nand so, when they came near to one another, they saluted the Vitellians\r\nand addressed them as friends and comrades. As the Vitellians made an\r\nangry and fierce response, the Othonians were discouraged, while their\r\nopponents imagined that they intended to desert. This incident at the\r\nfirst onset caused some confusion among the troops of Otho: and, besides\r\nthis, everything was in disorder, for the baggage train was entangled\r\namong the ranks, and the line was broken in many places by the ditches\r\nand trenches with which the ground was intersected, so that the\r\nsoldiers, in trying to avoid these obstacles, were forced to attack in\r\ndetail, and in disorganised crowds. Two[646] legions alone, that named\r\n\"Rapax\" on the side of Vitellius, and \"Adjutrix\" on that of Otho, were\r\nable to find a level plain, upon which they deployed into a regular line\r\nof battle and fought front to front for a long time. Otho's soldiers\r\nwere active and brave, but had never been in action before, while those\r\nof Vitellius had fought many battles, but were somewhat elderly and past\r\ntheir prime. At the first charge the Othonians drove them back, and\r\ncaptured their eagle, killing almost every man in the front rank; but\r\nthe Vitellians, filled with shame and rage, charged in their turn, slew\r\nOrfidius, the legate in command of the legion, and took many standards.\r\nThe corps of gladiators, who were supposed to possess both courage and\r\npractice in close combat, were attacked by Alphenus Varus with the\r\nBatavians, who inhabit an island formed by the river Rhine, and who are\r\nthe best horsemen in Germany. Few of the gladiators stood to receive\r\ntheir charge, but most of them fled towards the river, where they fell\r\nin with other bodies of the enemy, by whom they were entirely cut to\r\npieces. The worst fight of all was made by the Prætorians, who did not\r\neven wait until the enemy reached them, but by their panic flight\r\nstruck terror even into the unbroken troops through whose ranks they\r\nfled. Yet many of Otho's troops, after having conquered their immediate\r\nopponents, forced their way back through their victorious enemies to\r\ntheir own camp.\r\n\r\nXIII. Of the generals, neither Proculus nor Paullinus dared to return\r\nwith their men, but went off another way, fearing the soldiers, who\r\nalready began to throw the blame of their defeat upon the generals.\r\nAnnius Gallus assumed the command of the soldiers as they assembled in\r\nthe town of Bedriacum, and encouraged them by assurances that the battle\r\nhad been a drawn one, and that in many cases they had beaten the enemy.\r\nMarius Celsus called a meeting of the generals, and bade them take\r\nmeasures for the common good. He said that after so great a disaster and\r\nso much slaughter of their countrymen not even Otho himself, if he were\r\na right-thinking man, would wish to make any further trial of fortune;\r\nsince even Cato and Scipio, although they fought in defence of the\r\nliberty of Rome, were blamed for having wasted the lives of many brave\r\nmen in Africa, by not yielding to Cæsar immediately after the battle of\r\nPharsalia. All men, he urged, are equally liable to the caprices of\r\nfortune; but they have the advantage, even when defeated, of being able\r\nto form wise resolutions. By this reasoning Celsus convinced the\r\ngenerals: and when, on trying the temper of the soldiers, they found\r\nthem desirous of peace, and Titianus himself bade them begin\r\nnegotiations for agreement, Celsus and Gallus determined to go and\r\ndiscuss the matter with Cæcina and Valens. On their way they were met by\r\nsome centurions, who informed them that Vitellius's army was already\r\nadvancing, and that they had been sent on before by their generals to\r\narrange terms of peace. Celsus spoke with approval of their mission, and\r\nbade them return and conduct him to Cæcina. It happened that when they\r\ndrew near the army, Celsus was like to have lost his life: for the\r\ncavalry who formed the advance guard were the same who had been defeated\r\nin the ambuscade, and when they saw Celsus approaching, they set up a\r\nshout of rage and rode towards him. However the centurions stood before\r\nCelsus and kept them back; and as the other officers called to them to\r\nspare him Cæcina perceived that some disturbance was taking place and\r\nrode up. He quickly repressed the disorderly movement of the cavalry,\r\ngreeted Celsus affectionately, and proceeded with him to Bedriacum.\r\nMeanwhile Titianus had repented of having sent the embassy. He manned\r\nthe walls of the camp with those soldiers who had recovered their\r\nspirits, and was encouraging the rest to fight. However, when Cæcina\r\nrode up and held out his hand no one resisted him, but some of the\r\nsoldiers greeted his troops from the walls, and others opened the gates,\r\ncame out and mingled with the new-comers. No violence was done to any\r\none, but they all fraternised and shook each other by the hand, swore\r\nfealty to Vitellius and joined his army.\r\n\r\nXIV. The above is the account which most eye-witnesses give of the\r\nbattle, though they themselves admit that they do not know all the\r\ndetails of it because of the confusion which prevailed and the\r\nirregularity of the ground. Some time afterwards when I was journeying\r\nacross the battlefield, Mestrius Florus, a man of consular rank, who had\r\nfought under Otho not from choice but from necessity, showed me an\r\nancient temple, and related that after the battle he came there and saw\r\nso huge a pile of corpses, that those on the top were level with the\r\npinnacles of the roof. He said that he could not discover himself or\r\nlearn from any one else the cause of this heap; for though a greater\r\nslaughter of the vanquished is made in civil wars than in any others,\r\nbecause no quarter is given, as no use can be made of prisoners, yet it\r\nwas hard to imagine how such a mass of carcasses came to be piled\r\ntogether on that spot.\r\n\r\nXV. Otho, as is usual in such cases, first heard only confused rumours\r\nof how the battle went. When however wounded men came from the scene of\r\naction bringing the news of the defeat, not only his friends, as might\r\nbe expected, bade him keep up his spirits and not despair, but his\r\nsoldiers were wonderfully affected. None of them left him, or deserted\r\nto the enemy, and no one consulted his own safety when his chief\r\ndespaired of his. All of them alike repaired to his quarters, and called\r\nhim their emperor. When he came out to them, they fell at his feet and\r\ncaught hold of his hands with shouts, and prayers, and tears, beseeching\r\nhim not to desert them, or betray them to the enemy, but to make use of\r\nthem to fight for him, body and soul, until their last breath. While all\r\nbesought him thus, one of the common soldiers drew his sword, and\r\ncrying, \"Cæsar, this is what we are all prepared to do for you,\" stabbed\r\nhimself. Otho, unmoved by any of these entreaties, gazed round upon them\r\nall with a calm and composed countenance, and said: \"My comrades, your\r\nnoble conduct and your loyal devotion make this a happier day to me than\r\nthat on which you elected me your emperor. Yet do not deprive me of the\r\nstill greater happiness of dying for so many and such noble friends. If\r\nI am worthy to be an emperor of Rome, I ought not to grudge my life to\r\nmy country. I am aware that our enemy's victory is not decisive or\r\ncrushing. News has reached me that the Moesian legions have already\r\nreached the Adriatic, and are not many days' march distant. Asia, Syria,\r\nEgypt, and the army engaged with the Jews are all on our side, while we\r\nhave in our power both the senate, and the wives and children of our\r\nenemy. But we are not defending Italy from Hannibal, or Pyrrhus, or the\r\nCimbri, but Romans are fighting against Romans, and our native land will\r\nsuffer equally whichever side is victorious, for she must lose what the\r\nconqueror gains. Believe me, I pray you, that it is more to my honour to\r\ndie than to reign: for I cannot imagine that if victorious I could do\r\nanything which would benefit the Romans so much as I can by giving my\r\nlife to obtain peace and concord, and to save Italy from seeing another\r\nday such as this.\"\r\n\r\nXVI. After speaking thus, he tore himself away from the soldiers, who\r\ntried to hold him back and bade him take courage. He ordered his friends\r\nand such senators as were present to leave his camp: and to those who\r\nwere not present he sent similar orders, and also rescripts to the\r\nmagistrates of the cities through which they would have to pass, that\r\nthey might accomplish their journey[647] with honour and in safety. He\r\nnext sent for his nephew Cocceius, who was still a youth, and bade him\r\nbe of good cheer and not fear Vitellius, whose mother, children, and\r\nwife he himself had protected as carefully as if they had been members\r\nof his own family. He had wished, he said, to adopt the boy as his heir,\r\nbut had put off doing so till the end of the war, meaning to make him\r\nhis colleague if he succeeded, but not wishing to involve him in his own\r\ndestruction if he failed. \"My last charge to you,\" he continued, \"is\r\nthat you neither forget altogether nor yet remember too well that you\r\nhave had a Cæsar for your uncle.\" Shortly after this interview Otho\r\nheard a shouting and disturbance outside his quarters; for the senators\r\nwere preparing to depart, and the soldiers were threatening to murder\r\nthem if they did so, and reproached them with deserting their emperor.\r\nOtho, who feared for their lives, now came out a second time, no longer\r\nin a mild and supplicatory manner, but, frowning savagely, he cast so\r\nterrible a look upon the most turbulent of the rioters that they shrank\r\naway terrified and abashed.\r\n\r\nXVII. Towards evening he became thirsty, and drank a little water: after\r\nwhich he spent a long time in examining the blades of two swords. At\r\nlast he rejected one of them, and hid the other in his clothes. He now\r\ncalled together his servants, and distributed his money amongst them,\r\nnot recklessly, as though he were dealing with property not his own, but\r\ngiving them each various sums, carefully apportioned according to each\r\nman's deserts. When he sent them away he rested for the remainder of the\r\nnight, and those about his bed-chamber noticed how soundly he slept. At\r\ndaybreak he called to a freedman who had been entrusted with the\r\nmanagement of the departure of the senators, and ordered him to learn\r\nwhat had happened to them. When he was told that they had left the camp,\r\nand had received every attention they could wish, he said, \"Go now, and\r\nshow yourself to the soldiers unless you wish to perish miserably at\r\ntheir hands; for they will suspect you of having assisted me to die.\"\r\nWhen this man was gone, Otho held the sword upright with both his hands\r\nand fell upon it, dying with only one groan, which apprised those\r\nwithout of his fate. The wailing of his slaves was taken up by the whole\r\nof the camp and city. The soldiers noisily forced their way into his\r\nquarters and lamented over him with bitter grief, reproaching themselves\r\nfor not having guarded their emperor, and prevented his dying for them.\r\nNone of Otho's bodyguard deserted him, although the enemy was drawing\r\nnear, but after laying out his body, and erecting a funeral pile, they\r\nbore him to it, armed at all points; and happy was the man who could\r\nfind a place among the bearers. Of the rest, some kissed his wounds,\r\nsome pressed his hands, and some, who could not come near him, knelt as\r\nhis body passed by them. Some, who had received no especial favours from\r\nOtho, and had nothing to fear from his successor, slew themselves after\r\nthey had applied the torch to his funeral pile. It seems, indeed, that\r\nno king or despot ever was possessed with so frantic a desire to rule,\r\nas these men had to be ruled by Otho and to serve him; for their love\r\nfor him did not cease with his life, but remained implanted in their\r\nbreasts, causing them to regard Vitellius with the bitterest hatred. Of\r\nwhat followed from this I shall give an account in its proper place.\r\n\r\nXVIII. After the remains of Otho were buried they erected over him a\r\ntomb which could offend no one either by its size or by the pomp of its\r\ninscription. When I was at Brixellum I myself saw a small monument on\r\nwhich was written in the Latin language \"In memory of Marcus Otho.\"\r\n\r\nOtho died in his thirty-seventh year, after a reign of three months.\r\nMany good men, though they blamed his life, yet could not refrain from\r\nadmiring his death; for though his life had been no better than that of\r\nNero, his end was a far nobler one. When he was dead, Pollio, one of the\r\ntwo prefects, offended the soldiers by requiring them at once to swear\r\nfealty to Vitellius. Some of the senators were still left in Brixellum;\r\nand the soldiers, hearing of this, let them go with the exception of\r\nVirginius Rufus, whom they greatly embarrassed by coming to his house\r\nunder arms, and bidding him either take the command of them or at any\r\nrate act as ambassador on their behalf. Virginius, who had refused the\r\ncrown when it was offered him by a victorious army, thought that it\r\nwould be the act of a madman to accept it from a beaten one. He feared,\r\nalso, to go as an ambassador to the Germans, who thought that in time\r\npast he had forced them to do many things against their will.\r\nAccordingly, he escaped from his house by a back door; and the soldiers,\r\nwhen they discovered that he was gone, took the oaths to the new\r\nemperor. They were pardoned by him, and were sent to serve with the\r\ntroops under the command of Cæcina.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] More properly Mandyria. This battle was fought in August B.C. 338,\r\nthe same day as that of Chæronea. \"Not long before the battle of\r\nChæronea, the Tarentines found themselves so hard pressed by the\r\nMessapians, that they sent to Sparta, their mother city, to entreat\r\nassistance.

His death was a season of\r\npublic mourning, which lasted till another sacred bull was discovered by\r\nthe priests.--Dr. Smith's Classical Dictionary, s.v. Agis.\r\n\r\n[20] Plutarch calls the Lives of Agis and Kleomenes a History, though he\r\nsays in his Life of Alexander (c. 1) that his object is not to write\r\nHistories ([Greek: historiai]) but Lives ([Greek: bioi]). But the Lives\r\nof the two Spartan reforming kings may consistently enough be called a\r\nHistory, when contrasted with the Lives of the two Roman reforming\r\ntribunes. Plutarch's notion of History as contrasted with Biography\r\nappears pretty plainly from the first chapter of his Life of Alexander.\r\nA complete view of the events in the Lives of Alexander and Caius Julius\r\nCæsar would have formed, according to his notion, a History; but he does\r\nnot aim at this completeness: he selects out of the events of their\r\nlives such as best show the character of the men, whether the events be\r\nof great political importance or of none at all, and this method of\r\ntreating the subject he calls a Life. I believe the word Biography is a\r\nmodern invention. The distinction between History and Annals, though the\r\nwords have sometimes been used indiscriminately (c. 3, notes), is\r\nclearly expressed by the Roman historian Sempronius Asellio, as quoted\r\nby Aulus Gellius (v. 18).\r\n\r\n[21] Most of Plutarch's extant Lives run in parallels, whence they are\r\nentitled Parallel Lives. He compares a Greek with a Roman: thus he\r\ncompares Alexander with Caius Julius Cæsar, and Demosthenes with Cicero.\r\nThe beginning of the Life of Tiberius Gracchus is somewhat abrupt, after\r\nPlutarch's fashion. He had no regular plan for beginning and ending his\r\nstories, and thus he avoids the sameness which is so wearisome in a\r\nDictionary of Biography. The career of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus was\r\nthe same, and accordingly Plutarch considers their lives as one; and he\r\nhas found a parallel to them in two Spartan kings, who were also\r\nreformers, Agis IV. and Kleomenes III.\r\n\r\nAgis became king of Sparta B.C. 244, and reigned only four years: his\r\ncolleague in the first part of his reign was Leonidas II., and\r\nafterwards Kleombrotus. Agis attempted to restore the old institutions\r\nof Lykurgus which had fallen into disuse. Wealth had become accumulated\r\nin a few hands. He proposed to adjust the disputes between debtor and\r\ncreditor by the short method of abolishing debts; and he proposed to\r\nrestore the spirit of the old institutions by dividing all the lands in\r\nequal lots among the Spartan citizens, the chief class in the state; and\r\nby assigning lots also to the Perioeki, who were in the relation of\r\nsubjects. He carried the project for the abolition of debts, but before\r\nhe could accomplish the rest of his reforms, he was thrown into prison\r\nand strangled there. His grandmother and mother, both of whom had\r\nfavoured his schemes of reform, were strangled at the same time. He was\r\nabout twenty-four years of age when he died. His reform was not a\r\nrevolution, but an attempt to restore the old constitution.\r\n\r\nKleomenes III., King of Sparta, reigned from B.C. 236 to B.C. 220. In\r\nthe first part of his reign, the infant son of Agis IV., and afterwards\r\nArchidamus V., the brother of Agis IV., were his colleagues. Leonidas\r\nII., who had been deposed by Agis, had returned to Sparta during the\r\nabsence of Agis on a military expedition, and he was most active in\r\nbringing about the death of Agis. Leonidas compelled the widow of Agis\r\nto marry his son Kleomenes, who was instructed by his wife in the views\r\nand designs of Agis. Thus Kleomenes also became a reformer, and\r\nattempted to restore the institutions of Lykurgus. But his measures were\r\nviolent. He is charged with poisoning his infant colleague, the son of\r\nthe widow whom he married, and with other wrongful acts. He was defeated\r\nat the head of the Spartan army by Antigonus in the great battle of\r\nSellasia B.C. 222, and fled to Egypt, where he was kindly received by\r\nPtolemæus III. (Euergetes) the king. Ptolemæus IV. (Philopator) the\r\nsuccessor of Euergetes, put Kleomenes in prison, but he contrived to get\r\nout and attempted to make a revolution in Alexandria. Failing in the\r\nattempt Kleomenes killed himself. \"In this manner,\" says Polybius, \"fell\r\nKleomenes; a prince whose manners were dexterous and insinuating, as his\r\ncapacity in the administration of affairs was great: and who, to express\r\nhis character in a word, was most admirably formed by nature both for a\r\ngeneral and a king\" (Polybius, v. c. 39; Hampton's Translation, v. chap.\r\n4). Plutarch in his comparison of Agis and Kleomenes with Tiberius and\r\nCaius Gracchus, concludes that \"Tiberius in virtue surpassed the rest,\r\nthat the youth Agis was guilty of the fewest faults, and that in doing\r\nand daring Caius was much inferior to Kleomenes;\" which appears to be a\r\ncorrect judgment.\r\n\r\n[22] His complete name was Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. The Sempronia\r\ngens contained the families of the Atratini, Gracchi, and Pitiones. The\r\nGracchi were plebeians, and the Atratini patricians: the order of the\r\nPitiones is uncertain. The name of the Gracchi is best known from the\r\npolitical career of the two brothers, whose measures were the immediate\r\ncause of the civil disturbances which ended in the establishment of the\r\nImperial power. Tiberius Gracchus, the father, was tribune of the plebs\r\nB.C. 187, consul B.C. 177 and a second time in B.C. 163: he was censor\r\nB.C. 169. Tiberius Gracchus had his first triumph in B.C. 178 for his\r\nvictories over the Celtiberians in Spain while he was proprætor of\r\nHispania Citerior, or that division of the Peninsula which was nearer to\r\nthe Pyrenees (Liv. 41, c. 11). In his first consulship Gracchus had\r\nSardinia assigned for his province, and he defeated the Sardinians in a\r\ngreat battle. He was continued in his province as proconsul, and he\r\ncompletely subdued the island (Liv. 41, c. 21), for which he had a\r\ntriumph which appears to be commemorated by an extant medal (Rasche,\r\n_Lexicon Rei Numariæ_). Cicero numbers Tiberius among the Roman orators\r\n(_Brutus_, c. 20).\r\n\r\n[23] Publius Cornelius Scipio defeated Hannibal at the battle of Zama in\r\nthe territory of Carthage B.C. 202. He died B.C. 183 in his retirement\r\nat Liternum in Campania. Though Tiberius Gracchus, the father, was not\r\non friendly terms with Scipio, yet during his tribunate B.C. 187 he\r\nprevented Scipio from being tried on certain frivolous charges brought\r\nagainst him by the tribunes, and owing to this interference of Gracchus,\r\nthe greatest commander that Rome had yet seen, was allowed to spend the\r\nremainder of his days in quiet privacy. (Liv. 38, c. 50, &c.; Cicero,\r\n_De Provinciis Consularibus_, c. 8.)\r\n\r\n[24] This story of the snakes is told by Cicero in his treatise on\r\nDivination (i. 18, ii. 29). He says that Tiberius died a few days after\r\nhe had let the female snake go, and he refers as his authority to a\r\nletter of Caius Gracchus to M. Pomponius:--\"I wonder,\" says Cicero, \"if\r\nthe letting loose the female was to cause the death of Tiberius, and\r\nletting loose the male was to cause the death of Cornelia, that he let\r\neither of them go. For Caius does not say that the haruspices said any\r\nthing of what would happen if neither snake was let go.\" To the\r\nobjection, that the death of Gracchus did follow the letting loose of\r\nthe female snake, Cicero replies that he supposes he must have died of\r\nsome sudden attack, and he adds that the haruspices are not so unlucky\r\nbut that their predictions sometimes happen to come true.\r\n\r\n[25] I do not know if this offer of King Ptolemæus is noticed by any\r\nother writer. It is not certain whether it was Ptolemæus VI. Philometor\r\nor his younger brother Ptolemæus VII. Euergetes II. Their two reigns\r\nlasted 64 years from B.C. 181 to B.C. 117. Philometor died B.C. 146 and\r\nwas succeeded by Euergetes who died B.C. 117. The death of Tiberius\r\nGracchus the father is not ascertained. He married his wife Cornelia\r\nafter B.C. 183 and he was consul B.C. 163. His son Tiberius, who was\r\nkilled B.C. 133, was not thirty years old at the time and therefore was\r\nborn about B.C. 163. Caius, who was nine years younger, was born about\r\nB.C. 154. It is not known whether Caius was the youngest child of\r\nCornelia. Ptolemæus Philometor went to Rome B.C. 163, being driven out\r\nof his kingdom by his younger brother Euergetes, and he was well\r\nreceived by the senate. His brother also made a journey to Rome in the\r\nfollowing year, B.C. 162. In B.C. 154 Ptolemæus Euergetes was at Rome\r\nfor the second time, and he obtained the aid of the senate against his\r\nbrother. Both the brothers may have seen Cornelia at Rome, but probably\r\nduring the lifetime of her husband. Scipio Africanus, the son-in-law of\r\nCornelia, was sent on an embassy to Alexandria to Euergetes B.C. 143. An\r\nEgyptian king might wish to strengthen himself at Rome by an alliance\r\nwith the illustrious families of the Gracchi and the Scipios; but it is\r\nimpossible to determine which of these two kings was the suitor.\r\nPhilometor is spoken of as a mild and generous prince: Euergetes, who\r\nwas also called Physcon, or Big-belly, was a cruel sensualist. The\r\ndaughter of Scipio Africanus, the conqueror of Hannibal, might well\r\ndecline a marriage with him, and any Egyptian alliance would have been\r\nviewed as a degradation to a noble Roman matron. The portrait of Physcon\r\nis given in Rosellini's work on Egypt, from the ancient monuments, and\r\nhe is very far from looking like a winning suitor. Kaltwasser assumes\r\nthat it was Ptolemæus Philometor who made the offer to Cornelia; and he\r\nadds that he was also called Lathyrus; but this is a mistake; Lathyrus\r\nwas the surname of Ptolemæus VIII. Soter II., the son of Physcon. He has\r\nnot examined the chronology of these two kings.\r\n\r\n[26] This was Publius Cornelius Scipio Æmilianus Africanus Minor. He was\r\nthe son of L. Æmilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia, and he was the\r\nadopted son of P. Cornelius Scipio, the son of the conqueror of\r\nHannibal. According to the Roman usage in case of adoption, the son of\r\nÆmilius Paulus took the name of his adopted father, P. Cornelius Scipio,\r\nto which was added, according to the usage, the name of Æmilianus, which\r\nmarked the gens to which he belonged by birth. It was after the\r\ndestruction of Carthage that he acquired the additional name or title of\r\nAfricanus, like his adoptive grandfather, from whom he is usually\r\ndistinguished by the addition of the name Minor or younger. The daughter\r\nof Cornelia, whom he married, was named Sempronia. She was ugly and bore\r\nher husband no children, and they did not live harmoniously together.\r\n(Appian, _Civil Wars_, i. 20.) As to the Roman names see the note on\r\nMarius, c. 1.\r\n\r\n[27] The Greek name for Castor and Pollux, who were the sons of Jupiter\r\nand Leda. Pollux was a boxer, and Castor distinguished for his\r\nmanagement of horses and as a runner. Their statues were generally\r\nplaced side by side with their appropriate characters, to which Pluturch\r\nalludes.\r\n\r\n[28] Plutarch uses the Greek word Bema ([Greek: bêma]), which is\r\nthe name for the elevated stone station in the Pnyx from which the\r\nAthenian orators addressed the public assemblies. The place from which\r\nthe Roman orators addressed the public assemblies was called the Rostra,\r\nor the beaks, because it was ornamented with the beaks of the ships\r\nwhich the Romans took from the people of Antium. (Liv. 8, c. 14.) The\r\nRostra were in the Forum, and in a position between the Comitium and\r\nthat part of the Forum which was appropriated to the meeting of the\r\nRoman tribes. (See Caius Gracchus, c. 5.)\r\n\r\n[29] The history of this Athenian demagogue is in Thucydides, ii. &c.\r\nThe play of Aristophanes called \"The Knights\" ([Greek: Hippês]) is\r\ndirected against him. By his turbulent oratory he acquired some\r\ndistinction at Athens during the Peloponnesian war, after the death of\r\nPerikles. (See Plutarch, _Nikias_, c. 2, 3.)\r\n\r\n[30] The MSS. have [Greek: delphinas], dolphins, which some critics\r\nwould change to [Greek: delphikas], tables made at Delphi or in Delphic\r\nfashion. Plinius (_Nat. Hist._ 33, c. 11) speaks of these dolphins,\r\nthough he does not say what they were. The alteration in the text is\r\nquite necessary. The dolphins were probably ornaments attached to some\r\npiece of furniture. Plutarch gives the value in drachmæ, the usual Greek\r\nsilver coin, and the money of reckoning: the usual Roman money of\r\nreckoning was the sestertius. Plinius mentions the value of these\r\ndolphins at 5000 sestertii a pound, which would make 4 sestertii\r\nequivalent to a drachma. The drachma is reckoned at about 9-3/4_d._ and\r\nthe sestertius at 2-1/4_d._ under the Republic.\r\n\r\n[31] The original is literally \"an instrument for practising the voice\r\nby which they raise sounds.\" Perhaps a musician may be able to interpret\r\nthe passage, without explaining the instrument to be a pitch-pipe as\r\nsome have done. Cicero (_De Orat._ iii. 60) tells the same story\r\nsomewhat differently. He says that this Licinius was a lettered man\r\n(literatus homo), and that he used to stand behind Caius Gracchus, yet\r\nso as to be concealed, with an ivory pipe (fistula), when Gracchus was\r\naddressing the public assemblies; his duty was to produce a suitable\r\nnote either for the purpose of rousing his master when his tone was too\r\nlow or lowering his tone when it was too vehement. (See also Dion,\r\n_Fragmenta_, p. 39, ed. Reimarus.)\r\n\r\n[32] An augur was one who ascertained the will of the gods by certain\r\nsigns, but more particularly the flights of birds. The institution of\r\naugurs was coeval with the Roman state, and as the augural ceremonial\r\nwas essential to the validity of all elections, the body of augurs\r\npossessed great political influence. The college of augurs at this time\r\nconsisted of nine members, who filled up the vacancies that occurred in\r\ntheir body. A member of the college held his office for life, and the\r\nplaces were objects of ambition to all the great personages in the\r\nstate. They were not appropriated to a class of priests: they were held\r\nby persons who had no other priestly character. Cicero, for instance,\r\nwas an augur. The Roman system of placing the highest religious offices\r\nnot in the hands of a priestly class, but in the hands of persons who\r\nhad held and might still hold civil offices, perhaps possessed some\r\nadvantages. There are many valuable remarks on the Roman Auguria and\r\nAuspicia in Rubino, _Untersuchungen über Römische Verfassung_.\r\n\r\n[33] Appius Claudius Pulcher was a member of the Claudia gens, and\r\nbelonged to an old patrician family, which had long been opposed to all\r\nthe pretensions of the plebeian order. He was consul B.C. 143. He did\r\nnot long survive his son-in-law. Cicero (_Brutus_, 28) enumerates him\r\namong the orators of Rome; he observes that he spoke fluently, but with\r\nrather too much heat.\r\n\r\n[34] The rank of Princeps Senatus was given at one time by the censors\r\nto the oldest of those who had filled the office of censor (Liv. 27, c.\r\n11), but after the election of Q. Fabius Maximus mentioned in the\r\npassage of Livius, it was given to any person whom the censors thought\r\nmost fit; and it was for the same person to be reappointed at each\r\nsuccessive lustrum, that is, every five years. It was now merely an\r\nhonorary distinction, though it had once been a substantive office. The\r\ntitle was retained under the Empire by the Emperors; and Princeps is the\r\ntitle by which Tacitus designates Augustus and his successor Tiberius.\r\nThe title has come down to us through the French language in the form of\r\nPrince.\r\n\r\nPlutarch sometimes gives the Roman words in a Greek form, but he more\r\nusually translates them as well as he can, which he has done in this\r\ninstance. The titles consular, censorian, prætorian, were the Roman\r\nnames for designating a man who had been consul, censor, or prætor.\r\n\r\n[35] Livius (38, c. 57) is one of those who tell the story of Scipio\r\nAfricanus the elder giving his daughter Cornelia to Tiberius Gracchus\r\nthe father. Plutarch has done best in following Polybius, who was\r\nintimate with the younger Africanus and had the best means of knowing\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\n[36] I have retained this name for Africa as it is in Plutarch. The\r\nGreek name for the continent of Africa was Libya ([Greek: Libyê]),\r\nwhich the Romans also used. In the Roman writers Africa properly denotes\r\nthe Roman province of Africa, which comprehended Carthage and a\r\nconsiderable territory; but it was common enough for the Romans to\r\ndesignate the whole continent by the name of Africa.\r\n\r\n[37] Plutarch is here alluding to the campaign of Scipio in which he\r\ndestroyed Carthage B.C. 146, whence he got the name of Africanus. It was\r\nusual for the Roman commanders to have with them a number of youths of\r\ngood family who went to learn the art of war, and were trained under the\r\neye of the general, to whose table and intimacy they were admitted\r\naccording to their deserts. Thus Agricola, during his early service in\r\nBritain, was attached to the staff of Suetonius Paullinus. (Tacitus,\r\n_Agricola_, c. 5.) Those who were admitted to the intimacy and tent of\r\nthe commander, were sometimes called Contubernales.\r\n\r\n[38] Caius Fannius Strabo was quæstor in the consulship of Cn.\r\nCalpurnius Piso and M. Popilius Lænas B.C. 139, and two years after he\r\nwas prætor. He served in Africa under the younger Scipio Africanus, and\r\nin Spain under Fabius Maximus Servilianus. He was the son-in-law of\r\nLælius, surnamed Sapiens, or the Prudent. He wrote an historical work\r\nwhich Cicero sometimes calls a History (_Brutus_, c. 26), and sometimes\r\nAnnals (_Brutus_, c. 21; _De Oratore_, ii. 67). It is unknown what\r\nperiod his work comprised, except that it contained the history of the\r\nGracchi. Cicero does not speak highly of his style, but Sallustius seems\r\nto commend his veracity (Lib. i. _Historiarum_).\r\n\r\nTiberius would be entitled to a mural crown (muralis corona), which was\r\nthe reward of the soldier who first ascended the enemy's wall. Plutarch\r\nappears to mean that Fannius also received one. Livius (26, c. 48)\r\nmentions an instance of two mural crowns being given by Scipio\r\n(afterwards Africanus) at the capture of Nova Carthago (Carthagena) in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[39] It appears that at this time the quæstors had their provinces\r\nassigned by lot, and this was the case under the Empire. (Tacitus,\r\n_Agricola_, c. 6.) The functions of a quæstor were of a civil kind, and\r\nrelated, in the provinces, to the administration of the public money. He\r\nwas a check on the governor under whom he served when he was an honest\r\nman: sometimes the quæstor and governor agreed to wink at the\r\npeculations of each other.\r\n\r\n[40] Caius Hostilius Mancinus was consul with Marcus Æmilius Lepidus\r\nB.C. 137. Numantia, which gave the Romans so much trouble, was situated\r\nin Old Castile on the Douro, but it is not certain what modern site\r\ncorresponds to it.\r\n\r\n[41] The Romans used the words Iberia and Hispania indifferently to\r\ndenote the Spanish Peninsula. From the word Hispania the Spaniards have\r\nformed the name España, the French Espagne, and the English Spain. The\r\nriver Ebro, which the Romans called Iberus, is a remnant of this old\r\nname. The Iberi originally occupied a part of Southern Gaul (the modern\r\nFrance) as far east as the Rhone, where they bordered upon the\r\nLigurians. They were a different people from the Celtæ, who in the time\r\nof C. Julius Cæsar occupied one of the three great divisions of Gaul.\r\n(_Gallic War_, i. 1.) The Celtæ, at some unknown time, crossed the\r\nPyrenees and mingling with the Iberi, formed the Celtiberi, a warlike\r\nrace with whom the Romans had many wars, and over whom Tiberius, the\r\nfather of Tiberius Gracchus, gained a victory. (Note, c. 1.) It is\r\nmaintained by William Humboldt in his work on the original inhabitants\r\nof Spain (_Prüfung der Untersuchungen über die Urbewohner Hispaniens_)\r\nthat the present Basque is a remnant of the Iberian language, which he\r\nsupposes not to have been confined to Spain, but to have spread over\r\npart of Italy, the south of France, and the islands of Sicily, Sardinia,\r\nand Corsica. Thucydides (vi. 2) says that the Sicani, or old inhabitants\r\nof Sicily, were Iberi who were driven from the river Sicanus in Iberia\r\nby the Ligurians.\r\n\r\nThe name Iberia was also given by the Greeks and Romans to a part of\r\nthat mountainous region, commonly called the Caucasus, which lies\r\nbetween the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The Albani and Iberi were the\r\ntwo chief nations that occupied this tract; the Albani were between the\r\nCaspian Sea and the Iberi, who were their neighbours on the west. The\r\ngreat river Cyrus (Kur) flowed through Albania into the Caspian. Iberia\r\nwas partly surrounded by the mountains of the Caucasus and it bordered\r\non Armenia and Colchis: the river Cyrus was the chief river (Strabo,\r\n499, ed. Casaub.). There is no evidence that these Iberi of the Caucasus\r\nwere related to the western Iberi. The country was invaded by the Romans\r\nunder L. Lucullus and Pompeius Magnus.\r\n\r\n[42] The allusion is to a memorable event in the Samnite war. The\r\nconsuls Spurius Postumius Albinus and Titus Veturius Calvinus B.C. 321,\r\nwith their army, were caught by the Samnites in the pass called Furculæ\r\nCaudinæ, and they were compelled, in order to save themselves, to submit\r\nto the ignominy of passing under the yoke. The Roman senate rejected the\r\nterms which had been agreed on between the consuls and the officers of\r\nthe army on the one side, and the Samnites on the other. It was not a\r\ntreaty (foedus) as Livius shows, for such a treaty could not be made\r\nwithout the consent of the Populus nor without the proper religious\r\nceremonies. (Liv. 9, c. 5.) The senate, upon the proposition of\r\nPostumius himself, sent to the Samnites all the persons who were parties\r\nto the agreement and offered to surrender them, but the Samnites would\r\nnot receive them and they upbraided the Romans for want of good faith.\r\n\r\nMancinus also supported the proposition for his own surrender to the\r\nNumantines, and he was offered to them in due form by the officer called\r\nthe Pater Patratus, but the Numantines declined accepting him. (Cicero,\r\n_De Officiis_, iii. 30.) The principle that a general could not formally\r\nmake a treaty, and that all treaties required the sanction of the senate\r\nor in earlier times perhaps of the patrician body in their assembly,\r\nappears to be well established. Those who made the treaty with a Roman\r\ngeneral might not know this constitutional rule, but the principle on\r\nwhich the Romans acted in such cases was sound, and the censure that has\r\nbeen directed against them as to their conduct in such transactions,\r\nproceeds from ignorance of the Roman constitution and of the nature of\r\nthe power which a sovereign state delegates to its ministers. Delegated\r\npower or authority never authorises the persons to whom it is delegated\r\nto do an act which is inconsistent with the constitution or fundamental\r\nprinciples on which the sovereign power is based.\r\n\r\nMancinus returned to Rome and ventured to appear in the senate, but a\r\nquestion was raised as to his right to be there, for it was argued that\r\na man who had been so surrendered ceased to be a citizen and could not\r\nrecover his civic rights by the fiction of postliminium, as a man who\r\nhad escaped from the enemy could. (Cicero, _De Oratore_, 40.) But the\r\nsubtlety of the Romans found a solution of the difficulty in the case of\r\nMancinus: there can be no surrender, if there is nobody to receive the\r\nsurrender; therefore Mancinus was not surrendered; therefore he was\r\ncapable of recovering his civil rights. (Cicero, _Topica_ 1.)\r\n\r\n[43] The war of Numantia was prolonged to their disgrace, as the Romans\r\nconsidered it, and they at last elected Scipio consul B.C. 134, and sent\r\nhim to Spain. He took Numantia after a siege of fifteen months, and\r\ntotally destroyed it, B.C. 133, the same year in which his\r\nbrother-in-law Tiberius Gracchus lost his life. (Velleius Paterc. ii.\r\n4.) Caius Gracchus, the brother of Tiberius, served under Scipio at\r\nNumantia, and also Jugurtha, afterwards king of the Numidians, and Caius\r\nMarius, the conqueror of Jugurtha.\r\n\r\n[44] Plutarch's account of the Roman public land is brief and not\r\nsatisfactory. A clearer statement, which differs from Plutarch's in some\r\nrespects, is given by Appian. (_Civil Wars_, i. 7, &c.) The Roman\r\nterritory (Romanus Ager) was originally confined to a small circuit, as\r\nwe see from the history of the early wars of Rome. Even Aricia (La\r\nRiccia) about fifteen miles south-east of Rome, was a city of the Latin\r\nconfederation in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus. (Liv. 1, c. 50.) The\r\nRomans extended their territory by conquest, and they thus acquired\r\nlarge tracts of land in Italy, which were made the property of the state\r\nunder the name of Ager Publicus. This public land was enjoyed originally\r\nby the patricians, and perhaps by them only, on payment of a certain\r\nrent to the treasury (Ærarium). The rents of the public land were a\r\nlarge part of the public income, and intended to defray a portion of the\r\npublic expenditure. The plebs soon began to lay claim to a share in\r\nthese lands, and a division of some tracts was made among the plebeians\r\nin the reign of Servius Tullius. The lands divided among the plebeians\r\nwere given to them in ownership. The tracts of public land which were\r\nenjoyed by the patricians on the terms above mentioned, were considered,\r\nas they, in fact, were, public property; and the interest of the\r\npatricians in such lands was called a possession (possessio). Those who\r\nenjoyed the public land as a possessio were said to possess it\r\n(possidere), and they were called possessores, a term which often occurs\r\nin the first six books of Livius, and which Plutarch has attempted to\r\ntranslate by a Greek word ([Greek: ktêmatikoi]). It is likely enough\r\nthat the patricians abused their right to the use of the land by not\r\nalways paying the rent; as we may collect from the passages in Dionysius\r\n(_Antiq. Rom._ viii. 70, 73, ix. 51, x. 36). Their enjoyment of\r\nextensive tracts also prevented the public land from being distributed\r\namong the plebeians to the extent that they wished. The disputes between\r\nthe two orders in the state, the aristocracy or nobles and the\r\nplebeians, or, as Livius generally calls them, the patres and the plebs;\r\n(the padri and the plebe of Machiavelli, _Discorsi_, &c.), about the\r\npublic land, commenced with the agitation of Spurius Cassius, B.C. 486,\r\nthe history of which is given by Livius in his Second Book (c. 41). The\r\ncontest was continued at intervals to B.C. 366, when a law was passed\r\nwhich is commonly called one of the Licinian Rogations, which forbade\r\nany man to have a possession in the public lands to the amount of more\r\nthan 500 jugera. This is the law to which Plutarch alludes.\r\n\r\nThe extent and difficulty of the subject of the public land makes it\r\nimpossible to examine it fully in a note. I propose to treat of it at\r\nlength in an appendix in a future volume.\r\n\r\n[45] The words in Plutarch literally signify \"barbarian prisons,\" but I\r\nhave used the word ergastula, which was the Roman name, though it is a\r\nword of Greek origin, and signifies \"working-places.\" The ergastula were\r\nplaces generally under ground and lighted from above: they were used\r\nboth as places to work in and as lodging-places for slaves who\r\ncultivated the fields in chains. (Plinius, _N.H._ 18, c. 3; Florus, iii.\r\n19.) They were also places of punishment for refractory slaves. The\r\nobject of these places of confinement was also to prevent slaves from\r\nrunning away, and rising in insurrection. The slaves were placed at\r\nnight in separate cells to prevent all communication between them. When\r\nthe slaves broke out in rebellion in Sicily under Eunus, who is\r\nmentioned by Plutarch (Sulla, c. 36), the ergastula were broken open,\r\nand a servile army of above sixty thousand men was raised. The Roman\r\nmaster had full power over his slave, who was merely viewed as an\r\nanimal; and these ergastula, being in the country and out of sight,\r\nwould give a cruel master full opportunity of exercising his tyranny.\r\nThey were abolished by the Emperor Hadrian (Spartianus, _Hadrianus_,\r\n18).\r\n\r\n[46] C. Lælius, the father, was an intimate friend of Scipio Africanus\r\nthe Elder. C. Lælius, the son, the Wise or the Prudent, was also an\r\nintimate friend of the younger Africanus. Cicero's treatise on\r\nFriendship is entitled Lælius in honour of Lælius the Prudent.\r\n\r\n[47] Tiberius Gracchus was elected Tribune B.C. 133, and he lost his\r\nlife the same year.\r\n\r\n[48] Cicero (_Brutus_, c. 27) calls the Greek Diophanes a teacher of\r\nTiberius Gracchus. Blossius is mentioned by Cicero (_Lælius_, c. 11) as\r\none of those who urged Tiberius to his measures of reform. Antipater of\r\nTarsus was a Stoic. The two sons of Cornelia had a learned education and\r\nwere acquainted with the language and philosophy of the Greeks, and it\r\nis probable that the moral and political speculations with which they\r\nthus became familiar, and their associating with Greeks, had\r\nconsiderable influence on their political opinions. Tiberius Gracchus\r\nthe father was also well enough acquainted with Greek to speak the\r\nlanguage. His oration to the Rhodians was spoken in Greek.\r\n\r\n[49] It does not seem certain what Postumius is intended. Sp. Postumius\r\nAlbinus Magnus was consul B.C. 148, and is supposed by Meyer (_Orat. Rom.\r\nFragmenta_, 197) to be the orator alluded to by Cicero (_Brutus_, 25).\r\nBut this Postumius was too old to be a rival of Gracchus. Another of the\r\nsame name was consul B.C. 110, and conducted the war against Jugurtha\r\nunsuccessfully; but he was perhaps too young to be a rival of Gracchus.\r\n(Cicero, _Brutus_, 34.)\r\n\r\n[50] This was P. Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives, the son of P. Mucius\r\nScævola, and the adopted son of P. Licinius Crassus Dives, as appears\r\nfrom Cicero (_Academ._ 2, c. 5), who mentions him with his brother P.\r\nScævola as one of the advisers of Tiberius Gracchus in his legislation.\r\nCrassus was consul with L. Valerius Flaccus B.C. 131. He was a soldier,\r\na lawyer, and an orator. He lost his life in the war against Aristonikus\r\nin the Roman province of Asia B.C. 131. It is remarked that he was the\r\nfirst pontifex maximus who went beyond the limits of Italy, for he was\r\nconsul and pontifex maximus when he went to carry on the war against\r\nAristonikus. (Livius, _Epitome_, 59.) The pontifex maximus, as the head\r\nof religion, had important duties which required his presence at Rome.\r\n\r\n[51] The illustrious family of the Scævolæ produced many orators and\r\njurists. This Scævola was P. Mucius Scævola, the brother of P. Licinius\r\nCrassus Mucianus. He was consul B.C. 133, the year in which Tiberius\r\nGracchus attempted his reform. He attained the dignity of pontifex\r\nmaximus in B.C. 131 on his brother's death. Scævola was probably a timid\r\nman. Cicero states that his brother openly favoured the measures of\r\nTiberius; and Scævola was suspected of doing so. After the death of\r\nTiberius he approved of the conduct of Scipio Nasica, who was the active\r\nmover in this affair, and assisted in drawing up several decrees of the\r\nSenate in justification of the measure and even in commendation of it.\r\n(Cicero _Pro Domo_, c. 34; _Pro Plancio_, 36.) He was a great orator,\r\nbut his chief merit was as a jurist. He was the father of a son still\r\nmore distinguished as a jurist, Quintus Mucius Scævola, who also became\r\npontifex maximus, and was one of the teachers of Cicero. He is\r\nconsidered to be one of those who laid the foundations of Roman law and\r\nformed it into a science (_Dig._ 1, tit. 2, s. 2). Quintus Mucius\r\nScævola, commonly called the augur, also a distinguished jurist, was a\r\ncousin of P. Mucius Scævola, the pontifex, and a teacher of Cicero\r\nbefore Cicero became a hearer of the pontifex.\r\n\r\n[52] The eloquence of Tiberius Gracchus is commemorated by Cicero\r\n(_Brutus_, c. 27), who had read his orations. He describes them as not\r\nsufficiently ornate in expression, but as acute and full of judgment.\r\nThe specimens of the orations of Tiberius (c. 9. 15) and those in Appian\r\n(_Civil Wars_, 9. 15) fully bear out the opinion of Cicero as to his\r\nacuteness. Some German writers assert that these speeches in Plutarch\r\nare either fabricated by him or taken from other writers; but assertions\r\nlike these, which are not founded on evidence, are good for nothing.\r\nPlutarch gives the speeches as genuine: at least he believes them to be\r\nso, and therefore he did not fabricate them. And it is not likely that\r\nany body else did. These two fragments (c. 9. 15) bear no resemblance to\r\nthe style of most writers who have fabricated speeches. They are in a\r\ngenuine Roman style. If any man could fabricate them, it was Livius, and\r\nPlutarch may have taken them from him.\r\n\r\n[53] The same expression occurs in Horace (1 _Carm._ 1), which there\r\nalso applies to the Romans, and not to the gods, as some suppose.\r\n\r\n[54] Marcus Octavius, who was one of the tribuni plebis B.C. 133, was a\r\ndescendant of Cneius Octavius, quæstor B.C. 230. Caius Octavius, better\r\nknown as Caius Julius Cæsar Octavianus and as the Emperor Augustus, was\r\na descendant of Caius the second son of Cneius. Cicero, whose opinion\r\nabout the Gracchi changed with the changed circumstances of his own\r\nlife, commends the opposition of Marcus Octavius to the measures of\r\nGracchus. (_Brutus_, c. 25.) He also says that Octavius was a good\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the tribuni plebis is one of the most important\r\nevents in the history of Rome, and the struggle between the plebeians\r\nheaded by their tribunes, and the nobility, is the development of the\r\nconstitutional history of Rome. Though there were tribunes in the kingly\r\nperiod, the establishment of the tribuni plebis as the guardians of the\r\nplebs is properly referred to the year B.C. 494, when the plebs seceded\r\nto the Mons Sacer or the Sacred Mount. On this occasion the patricians\r\nconsented to the election of two tribunes from the plebs. (Livius, 2, c.\r\n33: compare Livius, 2, 56. 58.) The number was afterwards increased to\r\nten, and this number continued unaltered. Only a plebeian could be\r\nelected tribune. The persons of the tribunes were declared to be sacred\r\n(sacrosancti). Their powers were originally limited, as above stated, to\r\nthe protection of the rights of the plebs and of the individuals of the\r\nplebeian body against the oppression of the patrician magistrates. It is\r\nnot possible within the compass of a note to trace the history of the\r\ngradual increase of the tribunitian power (tribunitia potestas): such a\r\nsubject is a large chapter in the history of Rome. Incidental notices\r\noften appear in Plutarch's Lives, which will help a reader to form a\r\ngeneral notion of the nature of the magistracy, and the effect which it\r\nhad on the development of the Roman constitution. The article Tribuni in\r\nSmith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities gives an outline of\r\nthe functions of the tribuni plebis.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the institution of the tribunate, the nobles learned the\r\nart of destroying the power of the college of tribunes by gaining over\r\none or more of the members; for, as Plutarch states, the opposition\r\n(intercessio) of a single tribune rendered the rest of his colleagues\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\n[55] As this is the first time that I have used this word, it requires\r\nexplanation. The origin of the Roman state is a matter involved in great\r\nobscurity; but its history after the expulsion of the kings B.C. 509 is\r\nthe history of a struggle between a class of nobles, an aristocracy, and\r\nthe people. The old nobility of Rome were the patricians, whom Livius\r\ncalls indifferently patres (father) and patricii. In his early History\r\npatres and plebs are opposed to one another, as we should now oppose the\r\nterms nobles or aristocracy, and commonalty or people; not that nobles\r\nand aristocracy are among us exactly equivalent, but in the history of\r\nRome there is no distinction between them. Livius frequently uses the\r\nterm patres and plebs as comprehending all the Roman citizens (ii. 33).\r\nThe word populus was originally and properly not the people in our\r\nsense; it signified the superior and privileged class and was equivalent\r\nto patricians. The plebs were originally not a part of the populus. In\r\nlater times the word populus was often used loosely to express generally\r\nthe Roman people, and the style and title of the Roman state was Senatus\r\nPopulusque Romanus--The Senate and the Roman populus, which term populus\r\nin the later republic certainly included the plebs, though the plebs is\r\nstill spoken of as a class. As the plebeians gradually obtained access\r\nto the higher honours of the state and to the consulship by a law of\r\nLicinius Stolo B.C. 366, a new class of nobles was formed out of those\r\npersons who had enjoyed those honours and out of their descendants. This\r\nclass was called nobiles by the Romans; the word nobilitas denoted the\r\nrank or title of the class, but it was also used like our word nobility\r\nto express the body of nobiles. Livius uses this term even in the\r\nearlier books of his History, but perhaps not with strict correctness,\r\nfor in some cases at least he makes the term nobility equivalent to the\r\npatricians. He wrote in the reign of Augustus, and he has not always\r\napplied his terms in the earlier periods with perfect accuracy. Still we\r\nmay trace the meaning of political terms in the Roman writers with great\r\nclearness, for no nation ever stuck more closely to old forms and\r\nexpressions, and there is a wonderful precision in the use of political\r\nterms by Roman writers of all ages and of all classes. The name\r\npatricians still existed after the term nobilis was introduced: a noble\r\nmight be either a patrician or a plebeian, but the distinction was well\r\nunderstood between an old patrician family and a plebeian family,\r\nhowever distinguished the plebeian family might become. Under the\r\nEmperors it was not uncommon for them to promote a man to the rank of\r\npatrician for eminent services, which under the monarchy was equivalent\r\nto the conferring of a title of dignity in modern times, and nothing\r\nmore. (Tacit. _Ann._ xi. 25.)\r\n\r\nIn Cicero we find the aristocratical order often spoken of as the\r\noptimates (the class of the best), a term which corresponds to the Greek\r\naristi ([Greek: aristoi]), whence we have the word aristocracy, which,\r\nhowever, the early Greek writers, at least, only used to express a form\r\nof government and not a class of persons. Cicero on one occasion (_Pro\r\nP. Sestio_, c. 45) attempts to give to the word optimates a much wider\r\nsignification; to make it comprehend all good and honest people: but\r\nthis is a mere piece of rhetoric. When a poor plebeian heard the\r\noptimates spoken of, he never imagined that it was intended to place him\r\namong them, were he as honest as the best man among the optimates.\r\nCicero also says the populares were those who merely spoke and acted to\r\nplease the multitude; which shows that populus must now have changed its\r\nmeaning: the optimates were those who wished to act so as to get the\r\napprobation of all honest men.\r\n\r\nPlutarch's perception of the early periods of Roman history was perhaps\r\nnot strictly exact; but he comprehended very clearly the state of the\r\nparties in the age of the Gracchi. On the one side were the nobles and\r\nthe rich, some of whom were noble and some were not; on the other side\r\nwere the people, the mass, the poor. The struggle was now between rich\r\nand poor, and the rich often became the leaders of the poor for the\r\npurpose of political distinction and influence, and hence the name\r\npopulares. Probably few states have ever presented the spectacle of the\r\nstriking contrast between wealth and poverty which the Roman state\r\nexhibited from the time of the Gracchi; a class of rich, rich by\r\nhereditary wealth and by all the modes of acquiring wealth which the\r\npossession of office and the farming of the public revenues offered to\r\nthem; a class of poor who were born poor, who had little industry and\r\nfew means of exercising it. To this we must add, that though there were\r\nmany cultivators in the country who might enjoy a moderate subsistence\r\nfrom their small estates, there was a city crowded with poor who had\r\nvotes, and by their union and numbers mainly determined the elections\r\nand the acceptance or rejection of legislative measures. Rome, in fact,\r\nwas the centre of all political agitation, and the result of a\r\nrevolution in the city generally determined the dispute between two\r\nrival factions. We have still to take into the account a very numerous\r\nclass of slaves. It is probable that in the earlier periods of Roman\r\nhistory the slaves were comparatively few; in the later republic they\r\nbecame very numerous. They formed a large part of the wealth of the\r\nrich, and they were always a dangerous body to the state. The effect of\r\nemploying slaves generally in agriculture and other occupations was, as\r\nit always must be, unfavourable to industry among free men. Slaves,\r\nalso, were often manumitted, and though the son of a manumitted slave\r\nwas in all respects on the same footing as a complete Roman citizen, if\r\nhis father was made such by the act of manumission, yet persons of this\r\ncondition, and especially those who had been liberated from slavery,\r\nwere looked upon as a somewhat inferior class. Their connection with the\r\npowerful families to which they had belonged, also gave such families\r\ngreat influence in all elections; and as we see in various instances,\r\nthe class of libertini, manumitted slaves, was viewed as a dangerous\r\nbody in the state. The equites at Rome can scarcely be called a middle\r\nclass: they were generally rich and the farmers of the revenues, under\r\nthe name of publicani. They were often opposed to the senate, but it was\r\nan opposition of pure interest, and their wealth made them rather the\r\npartisans of the aristocratical than of the popular body. Such were the\r\npolitical elements with which Tiberius Gracchus had to deal, when he\r\nattempted a reform which perhaps the times did not render practicable,\r\nand for which he certainly did not possess the courage or the judgment\r\nor the inflexible resolution which were necessary to secure success. The\r\nword in Plutarch which I have here translated nobles is [Greek:\r\ndynatoi], the powerful. In other places he calls them the rich ([Greek:\r\nplousioi]), the possessors [of public land] ([Greek: ktêmatikoi]), the\r\naristocratical body ([Greek: aristokratikoi]); and perhaps other terms.\r\nHe calls the plebs, or people as opposed to this class, by various\r\nnames, of which [Greek: dêmos] is the most common: he also calls them\r\nthe multitude ([Greek: plêthos]), the many ([Greek: hoi polloi]), and\r\nother like names.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to attain perfect precision in the use of political\r\nterms in a translation of Plutarch; and in order to be critically exact,\r\nit would be necessary to load these notes continually with remarks. But\r\nthis critical exactness is not required here: the opposition of the two\r\norders in the state is intelligible to everybody. The contests in Rome\r\nfrom the time of the Gracchi to the establishment of the monarchy under\r\nAugustus, were contests in which the rich and the powerful were\r\nconstantly struggling among themselves for political supremacy; there\r\nwas an acknowledged aristocratical and an acknowledged popular party.\r\nBut the leaders of both parties, with perhaps some few exceptions, were\r\nmainly bent on personal aggrandisement. The aristocratical class had a\r\nclearer object than the leaders of the popular party: they wished to\r\nmaintain the power of their order and that of the senate, which was the\r\nadministering body. The leaders of the popular party could have no clear\r\nobject in view except the destruction of the power of the senate: the\r\nnotion of giving the people more power than they possessed would have\r\nbeen an absurdity. Accordingly the depression of the aristocratical body\r\nhad for a necessary consequence the elevation of an individual to power,\r\nas in the case of Cæsar the dictator. Sulla, it is true, was an\r\naristocrat, and he destroyed so far as he could the popular party; but\r\nhe made himself dictator, and to the last day of his life he ruled all\r\nparties with a rod of iron.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a numerous and needy class who participated in\r\npolitical power without having any property which should be a guarantee\r\nfor their honest use of it, was the stuff out of which grew the\r\nrevolutions of Rome. There was a crowded city population, clamorous, for\r\ncheap bread, for grants of land, for public shows and amusements, averse\r\nto labour, constantly called into political activity by the annual\r\nelections, always ready to sell their votes to the best bidders; and a\r\nclass always ready to use this rabble as a tool for their political and\r\npersonal aggrandisement. Machiavelli observes (_Istor. Fiorent._ iii.)\r\nthat the natural enmity which exists between the men of the popular\r\nparty and the nobles (gli uomini Populari e i Nobili), proceeds from the\r\nwish of the nobles to command and of the others not to obey, and that\r\nthese are the causes of all the evils that appear in states. He adds\r\n(iv.) that states, and especially those that are not well constituted,\r\nwhich are administered under the name of republics, often change their\r\ngovernment and condition, but the fluctuation is not between liberty and\r\nservitude, as many suppose, but between servitude and licence. It is\r\nonly the name of liberty which is in the mouths of the ministers of\r\nlicence who are the popular leaders, and the ministers of servitude who\r\nare the nobles; both of them wish to be subject neither to the laws nor\r\nto men. These remarks, which are peculiarly applicable to Florence and\r\nthe so-called republics of Italy of that time, apply equally to the\r\nRoman state. There are governments, however, to which the name republic\r\ncan be properly applied, and that of Great Britain is one, which owing\r\nto the possession of certain elements have a more stable character.\r\nStill the general character of a popular and of an aristocratical party\r\nis correctly sketched by Machiavelli.\r\n\r\n[56] Plutarch, who is fond of allusions to the Greek poets, here alludes\r\nto a passage in the Bacchæ of Euripides, l. 387:\r\n\r\n                 \"for e'en in Bacchus' orgies\r\n   She who is chaste will never be corrupted.\"\r\n\r\nSee Bacchæ, ed. Elmsley, l. 317, 834, and the notes.\r\n\r\n[57] The temple of Saturn was now used, among other purposes, as the\r\ntreasury of the state, the Ærarium.\r\n\r\n[58] A dolo is described by Hesychius, v. [Greek: Dolônes], in one\r\nsense, as a dagger contained in a wooden case, a kind of sword-stick.\r\n(See Facciolati, _Lexicon_.) Kaltwasser describes it as a walking-stick\r\ncontaining a dagger, and translates the passage, \"he provided himself\r\nwith a robbers' dagger, without making any secret of it.\" I think that\r\nhe wore it concealed, but made no secret of it, which agrees better with\r\nthe whole context; and Amyot has translated it so.\r\n\r\n[59] The word in Plutarch is water jars, _hydriai_ ([Greek: hydriai]),\r\nthe Roman sitellæ, urnæ or orcæ. The sitellæ were a kind of jar with a\r\nnarrow neck: they were filled with water so that the wooden lots\r\n(sortes) would float at the top, and only one could be there at a time.\r\nThese lots were used for the purpose of determining in what order the\r\ntribes or centuries should vote, for the names of the several tribes or\r\ncenturies were on the several lots. The vessel into which the voters put\r\ntheir votes (tabellæ), when the order of voting had been fixed for the\r\ntribes and centuries, was called cista; and it was a basket of\r\nwicker-work or something of the kind, of a cylindrical shape. If\r\nPlutarch has used the proper word here, the preliminary proceedings were\r\ndisturbed by the rich seizing or throwing down the vessels, out of which\r\nwere to be drawn the lots for determining in what order the tribes\r\nshould vote. The business had not yet got so far as the voting, which\r\nconsisted in the voters depositing in a cista one of the tablets\r\n(tabellæ), which were distributed among them for this purpose, and which\r\nwere marked with an appropriate letter to express acceptance of a\r\nmeasure or rejection of it. There is a Roman denarius which represents a\r\nman going to put a tabella into a cista: the tabella is marked A, which\r\nmeans Absolvo, I acquit. The letter C (Condemno, I condemn) was marked\r\non the tabella of condemnation. (Eckhel, _Doctr. Num. Vet._ V. 166.) The\r\ncoin was struck to commemorate the carrying of a law by L. Cassius\r\nLonginus B.C. 137, by which the voting in criminal trials (judicia\r\npopuli) except for perduellio (treason) should be by ballot and not as\r\nbefore by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nThese remarks are taken from an essay by Wunder (_Variæ Lectiones &c. ex\r\nCodice Erfurtensi_), in which he has established the meaning of sitella\r\nand cista respectively to be that which Manutius long ago maintained. He\r\nobserves that in the Roman comitia one sitella would be sufficient, as\r\nit was only used for receiving the names of the tribes or centuries,\r\nwhich were put in for the purpose of determining by drawing them out, in\r\nwhat order the tribes or centuries should vote. And accordingly he says\r\nthat when comitia are spoken of, we never find urns or sitellæ spoken of\r\nin the plural number. But he has not mentioned the passage of Plutarch.\r\nIt may be difficult to determine if Plutarch considered that the\r\npreliminary lot-drawing had been gone through, and the people were\r\nvoting. If he considered the voting to be going on, he has used the\r\nwrong word. With this explanation, I leave the word \"voting-urns\" in the\r\ntext, which is not the correct Roman word but may be what Plutarch\r\nmeant. It seems as if he thought that the voting had commenced.\r\n\r\n[60] Plutarch writes it Mallius, for the Greeks never place _n_ before\r\n_l_.\r\n\r\n[61] From this it appears that the vote of each tribe counted as one,\r\nand the vote of the tribe was determined by the majority of voters in\r\neach tribe. It seems to follow that each tribe had a cista to receive\r\nits votes. It is said, the practice was to count the votes when all was\r\nover; but they must have been counted as each tribe voted, according to\r\nthis story. The narrative of Appian is the same (_Civil Wars_, i. 12).\r\n\r\n[62] The names of various Roman officers and functionaries were derived\r\nfrom their number, as duumviri (two men), triumviri (three men),\r\ndecemviri, and so on. Some description was added to the name to denote\r\ntheir functions. There were triumviri agro dando or dividendo, triumviri\r\nfor the division of public land; duumviri juri dicundo, for\r\nadministering justice, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[63] Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 13) calls him Quintus Mummius.\r\n\r\n[64] Plutarch and other Greek writers translate the Roman word, cliens,\r\nby Pélates ([Greek: pelatês]). (See Marius, c. 5, notes.)\r\n\r\n[65] Plutarch generally uses Attic coins. Nine oboli were a drachma and\r\na half, or about six sestertii. (See c. 2, note.)\r\n\r\n[66] See c. 21.\r\n\r\n[67] This Attalus III., the last king of Pergamum, left his kingdom to\r\nthe Romans on his death B.C. 133, the year of the tribunate of Gracchus.\r\nHis kingdom comprised the best part of that tract out of which the\r\nRomans formed the province of Asia. Pergamum was the name of the\r\ncapital. This rich bequest was disputed by Aristonikus. (See c. 20.)\r\n\r\n[68] Perhaps Q. Pompeius Rufus who was consul B.C. 141, and disgraced\r\nhimself by a treaty with the Numantines and his subsequent behaviour\r\nabout it. (Cicero, _De Officiis_, iii. 30; _De Finibus_, ii. 17; Appian,\r\n_Iberica_, c. 79.)\r\n\r\n[69] Quintus Cæcilius Metellus Macedonicus, who was consul B.C. 143.\r\nKaltwasser says, that Plutarch without doubt means Balearicus, the son\r\nof Metellus Macedonicus, which son was consul B.C. 123. Without doubt he\r\nmeans the father, who is mentioned by Cicero as an opponent of Tiberius\r\nGracchus, and he states that an oration of his against Gracchus was\r\npreserved in the Annals of Fannius. (_Brutus_, 21.)\r\n\r\n[70] Titus Annius Luscus was consul with Q. Fulvius Nobilior B.C. 153.\r\n(Cicero, _Brutus_, c. 20; Livius, _Epitome_, 58.)\r\n\r\n[71] It is clear that Plutarch believed this to be a genuine speech of\r\nTiberius. It is not an argument that he could have made, nor is it\r\nlikely that it is a fabrication of any professed speech-writer. It is\r\ntrue that there were many speeches extant among the Romans, which,\r\nthough mere rhetorical essays, were attributed to persons of note and\r\npassed off as genuine speeches. But this is either not one of them, or\r\nit has been managed with consummate art. The defence of Tiberius is a\r\nblot on his character. He could not avoid knowing that his arguments\r\nwere unsound. To abdicate, which means to resign a Roman magistracy, was\r\na different thing from being deprived of it. The Tribunes were elected\r\nat the Comitia Tributa, but they derived their powers by uninterrupted\r\nsuccession from the consecrated act (Lex Sacrata) done on the Holy Mount\r\nand confirmed after the overthrow of the Decemviral power. (Livius, 2,\r\nc. 33; 3, c. 55.) On this subject, see Bubino, _Untersuchungen über Röm.\r\nVerfassung_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[72] See Caius Gracchus, c. 5. Appian does not mention these measures of\r\nTiberius.\r\n\r\n[73] The elections of Tribunes in the time of Cicero were on the 17th of\r\nJuly (_Ad Attic._ i. 1). According to Dionysius the first Tribunes\r\nentered on their office on the 10th of December. Kaltwasser suggests\r\nthat as it was now the summer season, the country people were busy in\r\ntheir fields and could not come to the election, which thus would be in\r\nthe hands of the townspeople. If Tiberius was killed in July and entered\r\non his office in the previous December, this will agree with what Cicero\r\nsays of him, \"he reigned a few months.\" (_Lælius_, c. 12.)\r\n\r\n[74] A cage, the Roman cavea. This was one of the modes of ascertaining\r\nthe will of the gods. It was a firm belief among the nations of\r\nantiquity that the gods did by certain signs and tokens give men the\r\nopportunity of knowing their will. The determination of these signs was\r\nreduced to a system, which it was the duty of certain persons, augurs\r\nand others, to learn and to transmit. The careful reader will find many\r\nother notices of this matter in Plutarch and some in these notes. (See\r\nSulla, c. 6, notes.)\r\n\r\nP. Claudius Pulcher, who was consul B.C. 249, and in the command of the\r\nRoman fleet off Sicily, despised the omens. The fowls would not eat,\r\nwhich portended that his projected attack on the Carthaginians would be\r\nunfavourable; but Claudius said that if they would not eat, they should\r\ndrink, and he pitched the sacred fowls into the sea. He lost most of his\r\nships in the engagement that followed. (Cicero, _De Natura Deorum_, ii.\r\n3.) The \"birds\" of Plutarch are \"fowls,\" \"pulli.\"\r\n\r\n[75] His name was Fulvius Flaccus; the name of Flaccus belongs to the\r\nFulvii. As he was a friend of Tiberius, it is probable that a Marcus\r\nFulvius Flaccus is meant, who is mentioned in the Life of Caius.\r\n\r\n[76] This was P. Mucius Scævola. His colleague L. Calpurnius Piso was\r\nconducting the war in Sicily against the slaves who had risen. The\r\nSenate, according to Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 16), was assembled in the\r\nTemple of Fides on the Capitol. The circumstances of the death of\r\nTiberius are told by Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 15. 16), who states that\r\nthere was a fight between the partisans of Tiberius and the other party\r\nbefore the Senate met.\r\n\r\n[77] To make Plutarch consistent, we must suppose that Caius had\r\nreturned to Rome. (See c. 13.)\r\n\r\n[78] I can find nothing more about him. This strange punishment was the\r\npunishment for parricide.\r\n\r\n[79] Cicero (_Lælius_, c. 11) and Valerius Maximus (4, c. 7) make Lælius\r\nask these questions.\r\n\r\n[80] Aristonikus was an illegitimate son of Eumenes II. King of\r\nPergamum. He disputed the will of Attalus III. and seized the kingdom.\r\nPublius Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives, who was sent against him B.C.\r\n131, was unsuccessful, and lost his life; but Aristonikus was defeated\r\nby the consul M. Perperna B.C. 130, and taken to Rome, where he was\r\nstrangled in prison.\r\n\r\n[81] This is P. Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives, c. 9. 20.\r\n\r\n[82] This does not appear in the extant Lives which bear the name of\r\nNepos; but what we have under his name is a spurious work of little\r\nvalue except the Life of Atticus.\r\n\r\n[83] D. Junius Brutus Gallæcus was consul with P. Cornelius Scipio\r\nNasica Serapio B.C. 138. He completely subdued the Gallæci (people of\r\nGalicia) and the Lusitani who occupied a part of modern Portugal, and\r\ncarried the Roman arms to the western extremity of the Spanish\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\n[84] He was the colleague of Brutus B.C. 138, as just stated, and\r\nPontifex Maximus in the year of the death of Tiberius. He must have died\r\nsoon after going to Asia; for Publius Licinius Crassus Mucianus Dives\r\nwas Pontifex Maximus B.C. 131 (c. 9); but the remark in the Epitome of\r\nLivius (lib. 59) that he was the first Pontifex Maximus who went beyond\r\nthe limits of Italy is not true. The Pontifex Maximus, who was the chief\r\nof the college of Pontifices, was chosen for life. He could not be\r\ndeprived of his office, nor, it seems, could he give it up. Augustus\r\nallowed his old rival Lepidus to keep his dignity of Pontifex Maximus\r\ntill his death. (Dion Cassius, 49, c. 15.)\r\n\r\n[85] The line is from Homer's _Odyssey_, i. 47.\r\n\r\n[86] This is lost, and also Plutarch's Life of Scipio Africanus Major.\r\n\r\n[87] The word by which Plutarch has translated Forum is Agora ([Greek:\r\nagora]). A Forum was an open place or area, and is often generally used\r\nfor Public Place, such as almost every town has. _The_ Forum at Rome was\r\nthe Forum Romanum, which was situated between the Palatine and\r\nCapitoline Hills; it was surrounded by buildings and was the chief place\r\nfor the administration of justice and for the public assemblies. To keep\r\naway from the Forum here means to take no share in public affairs.\r\nSometimes, Forensic (forensis), a term comprehending all that relates to\r\npublic business and the proceedings in the courts, is opposed to\r\nDomestic (domesticus), private, as we see in Cicero (_Ad Attic._ i. 5,\r\n&c.).\r\n\r\n[88] As thirty-one was the age at which according to a law (Lex Annalis\r\nVillia) a man could become Quæstor, Tiberius, who was Quæstor before he\r\nwas tribune, must have been older than Plutarch says that he was; unless\r\nhe was elected Quæstor before the legal age.\r\n\r\n[89] The island of Sardinia was made a Roman province B.C. 235.\r\n\r\n[90] Lucius Aurelius Orestes and M. Æmilius Lepidus were consuls B.C.\r\n126.\r\n\r\n[91] This dream is mentioned by Cicero, _De Divinatione_, i. 26. C.\r\nGracchus told his dream to many persons, before he was elected tribune.\r\nIt happened while he was a candidate for the quæstorship.\r\n\r\n[92] Micipsa, King of Numidia, was the son of Massinissa, who was the\r\nfirm ally of the Romans in their contest with the Carthaginians in the\r\nSecond Punic War. At the close of this war, his territory was greatly\r\nenlarged by the addition of the dominions of Syphax and a large part of\r\nthe Carthaginian territory. He was succeeded by Micipsa, who died B.C.\r\n118. The Carthaginian territory which subsequently formed a large part\r\nof the Roman province of Africa was a rich corn country, and one of the\r\ngranaries of Rome under the latter Republic and the Empire.\r\n\r\n[93] Gracchus made his defence before the Censors Cn. Servilius Cæpio\r\nand L. Cassius Longinus B.C. 124. Gracchus belonged to the class of\r\nEquites, and as such he had a Public horse. The censors summoned him to\r\naccount for leaving his province, and, if he was not able to justify\r\nhimself, he would be deprived of his horse and marked with the Nota\r\nCensoria, in the lists of the Censors, the consequence of which was what\r\nthe Romans called Ignominia, or temporary civil incapacity.\r\n\r\nIf Caius was born B.C. 154 and had now (B.C. 124) served twelve years,\r\nhe entered the army B.C. 136, when he was eighteen. It is true as he\r\nhere says, that he was only required to serve ten years. This fragment\r\nof his speech is preserved by Aulus Gellius (xv. 12), and it is\r\nexpressed with all the vigour of the best Roman style. A comparison of\r\nthis fragment with the passages from the speeches of Tiberius Gracchus,\r\nwhich are given by Plutarch, is sufficient to show that Plutarch's\r\nextracts are genuine. There appears to be an error in Plutarch as to the\r\n\"three years.\" Gellius makes Caius say: \"Biennium fui in Provincia;\" \"I\r\nwas two years in the province:\" and one MS. is said to have \"two years\"\r\n([Greek: dietia]), which Coraes has adopted in his edition of Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[94] Fregellæ was a subject city in the territory of the Volsci. The\r\npeople wished to have the Roman citizenship, and as it was refused they\r\nrebelled. Fregellæ was destroyed by L. Opimius the Prætor B.C. 125.\r\nCaius Gracchus was tried B.C. 124 before the Prætor Opimius on the\r\ncharge of conspiring with the people of Fregellæ. (Velleius, 2, c. 6.)\r\n\r\n[95] Plutarch simply says the Plain ([Greek: to pedion]): but he means\r\nthe Campus Martius, or Field of Mars. Compare Marius c. 34. The Roman\r\nwriters often call the Campus Martius simply Campus.\r\n\r\nThe people did not mount on the house-tops to vote, as Amyot and\r\nKaltwasser say, if I understand them right. Crowds came to Rome, who had\r\nno votes; they came to see and to affect the elections if they could.\r\nCaius was elected tribune B.C. 123, just ten years after his brother's\r\ntribunate. The consuls were Quintus Cæcilius Metellus Balearicus, a son\r\nof Metellus Macedonicus, an opponent of Tiberius Gracchus, and Titus\r\nQuinctius Flamininus. (See Tiberius Gracchus, c. 14 notes.)\r\n\r\n[96] Cicero, in _Brutus_, c. 33, and in other passages, bears testimony\r\nto the powerful eloquence of Caius Gracchus. Up to the time of Cicero,\r\nthe orations of Gracchus were the models of oratory which all Romans\r\nstudied. Cicero says that his speeches did not receive the finishing\r\ntouch; he left behind him many things which were well begun, but not\r\nperfected. The practice of revising speeches for the purpose of\r\npublication was common among the Athenian and Roman orators. In manly\r\nand vigorous oratory we may doubt if Caius Gracchus ever had his equal\r\namong the Romans; and if not among the Romans, where shall we look for\r\nhis equal?\r\n\r\n[97] I have here allowed a word to stand by something of an oversight,\r\nto which however there is no objection. Plutarch uses the word \"law;\"\r\nbut the Roman word is \"Rogatio,\" which means a Bill, a proposed Law, so\r\ncalled because the form of passing a law was to ask (rogare) the\r\nassembly if they would have it. The form of voting was to reject\r\n(antiquare) by the formula A., or to confirm (jubere) by the formula\r\nU.R. (Uti Rogas), \"as you propose,\" which were marked on the tabellæ or\r\nvoting-tablets. (Cicero, _Ad Attic._ i. 14.)\r\n\r\nTo Promulgate a law, or more properly a Rogation, signified among the\r\nRomans, to make public (for promulgare is only another form of\r\nProvulgare) a proposed law; to give notice of a proposed measure and its\r\ncontents. To promulgate a law in modern times means to make known a law\r\nwhich is already a law; but the expression is not much used.\r\n\r\n[98] P. Popillius Lænas was also consul with P. Rupilius B.C. 132. He\r\nreturned to Rome after the death of Caius Gracchus.\r\n\r\n[99] The erecting of statues to their great men was probably more common\r\nat Rome after the conquest of Greece, when they became acquainted with\r\nGreek art. Rome at a later period was filled with statues. Though most\r\nof the great Romans were distinguished by their military talents, it was\r\nnot only in respect of military fame that statues were erected; nor were\r\nthey confined to men as we see in this instance. The daughter of him who\r\nconquered Hannibal, the wife of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, a\r\nsuccessful general, a prudent politician and an honest man, the mother\r\nof two sons who died in the cause of the people--the memory of such a\r\nwoman was perpetuated in the manner best suited to the age by an\r\nimperishable monument.\r\n\r\n[100] A complete view of the legislation of Gracchus is beyond the\r\nlimits of a note. Part of the subject has been referred to already.\r\n(Tiberius Gracchus, c. 8, note.)\r\n\r\nThe Roman allies (Socii) were subjects of the Roman State, subject to\r\nthe sovereign power of Rome, a power which was distributed among many\r\nmembers. They bore heavy burdens, particularly in the form of supplies\r\nof men and money for war; and they claimed as an indemnification the\r\ncitizenship (civitas), or admission to the sovereign body, as members of\r\nit. The claim was finally settled by the Marsic or Social war. (See\r\nMarius and Sulla.)\r\n\r\nThe law about the price of grain belonged to the class of Laws which the\r\nRomans called Frumenteriæ Leges, or Corn Laws; the object of these laws\r\nwas not to keep up the price of grain, but to furnish it to the poor at\r\na low rate. This low rate however was not effected in the only way in\r\nwhich such an object could profitably be effected, by allowing corn to\r\ncome to Rome from all parts free of duty, but by buying grain with the\r\nPublic money and selling it to the poor at a lower rate. This law of\r\nGracchus proposed that corn should be sold to the people (plebs) monthly\r\nat the rate of 5/6 of the as for a modius. This is the first recorded\r\ninstance in Roman History of the poor being relieved in this manner. The\r\ncity was crowded with poor who had few or no means of subsistence, but\r\nhad votes in the annual elections and were members of the sovereign\r\nbody. The consequences of such a measure might be easily foreseen: the\r\ntreasury became exhausted, and the people were taught to depend for\r\ntheir subsistence, not on their industry, but on these almost gratuitous\r\ndistributions of grain. This allowance, which was made monthly, added to\r\nthe sale of their votes at the annual elections and the distributions on\r\nextraordinary occasions, of corn and oil (Dion Cassius, 43, c. 31) helped\r\na poor Roman to live in idleness. This system of distributions of corn,\r\nsometimes free of cost, being once established was continued all through\r\nthe Republic and under the Empire. It was impossible to stop the evil,\r\nwhen it had been rooted, and in the crowded city of Rome under the\r\nEmpire, it was an important duty of the adminstration to prevent famine\r\nand insurrection by provisioning the city. C. Julius Cæsar reduced the\r\nnumber of those who received this corn relief from 320,000 to 150,000.\r\nThe number of receivers must have increased again, for Augustus reduced\r\nthe number to 200,000. This subject of the distribution of corn among\r\nthe poor is an important element in the history of the later Republic.\r\nDureau de la Malle (_Économie Politique des Romains_, ii. 307) has\r\ncompared it with the English mode of providing for the poor by the Poor\r\nLaws; but though there are some striking points of resemblance between\r\nthe two systems, there are many differences, and the matter requires to\r\nbe handled with more knowledge and judgment than this writer has shown\r\nin order to exhibit it in its proper light.\r\n\r\nPlutarch's account of the changes made by Gracchus in the body of the\r\nJudices is probably incorrect. The law of Gracchus related to trials for\r\noffences, such as bribery at elections (ambitus), and corruption in the\r\nadministration of offices (repetundæ), which belong to the class of\r\ntrials called at a later time judicia publica or public trials. In the\r\ntrials for these offences, those who had to decide on the guilt or\r\ninnocence of the accused, were called judices; and the judices were\r\ntaken only from the senators. But as the persons accused of offences, of\r\nthe kind above mentioned generally belonged to the senatorian order, it\r\nwas found very difficult to get a man convicted. Some notorious\r\ninstances of acquittals of persons, who had been guilty of corruption,\r\nhad occurred just before Gracchus proposed his law. According to Appian,\r\nhis law gave the judicial power solely to the equites, who formed a kind\r\nof middle class between the senators and the people. But the equites\r\nwere not a safe body to intrust with this power. To this body belonged\r\nthe publicani, or publicans as they are called in our translation of the\r\nGospels (_Matt._, ch. v., v. 47), who farmed the revenues in the\r\nprovinces. A governor who winked at the extortion of the farmers of\r\ntaxes would easily be acquitted, if he was tried for maladministration\r\non his return to Rome. The equites at Rome had an interest in acquitting\r\na man who favoured their order. Cicero remarks (_In Verrem_, Act Prima,\r\n13) that the judices were selected out of the equites for near fifty\r\nyears until the functions were restored to the senate. He is alluding to\r\nthe change Sulla made B.C. 83; but it appears that there were some\r\nintermediate changes. Cicero adds that during all this time there was\r\nnever the slightest suspicion of any eques taking a bribe in the\r\ndischarge of his functions as judex. Appian says that they soon became\r\ncorrupt; and Cicero, who is in the habit of contradicting himself, says\r\nin effect the same thing (_In Verrem_, lib. iii. 41; _Brutus_, c. 34).\r\nThe judices of Gracchus condemned Opimius, whose character Cicero\r\nadmired. (See c. 18, notes.) The condemnation was either honest or\r\ndishonest: if honest, Cicero is a dishonest man for complaining of the\r\nsentence (_Pro Plancio_, c. 29): if dishonest then Cicero here\r\ncontradicts what he has said elsewhere. (See also _In Pisonem_, c. 39.)\r\n\r\nI have used the Roman word judices, which is the word that Plutarch has\r\ntranslated. These judices were selected out of the qualified body by lot\r\n(at least this was the rule sometimes) for each particular trial. A\r\njudge, generally the prætor, presided, and the guilt or innocence of the\r\naccused was determined by the judices by a majority of votes; the votes\r\nwere given by ballot at this time.\r\n\r\nThis law of Gracchus about the judicia is a difficult subject, owing to\r\nthe conflicting evidence.\r\n\r\n[101] The character of the Roman roads is here accurately described. The\r\nstraight lines in which they ran are nowhere more apparent than in\r\nEngland, as may be seen by inspecting the Ordnance maps. That from\r\nLincoln to the Humber is a good example. It is conjectured that some of\r\nthe strong substructions at La Riccia (Aricia) on the Appian Road near\r\nRome may be the work of Caius; but I do not know on what this opinion\r\nrests. (See _Classical Museum_, ii. 164.)\r\n\r\nThe Roman mile is tolerably well ascertained. It is variously estimated\r\nat 1618 and 1614 yards, which is less than the English mile. The subject\r\nof the stadium, which was the Greek measure of length, is fully examined\r\nby Colonel Leake, _London Geographical Journal_, vol. ix.\r\n\r\n[102] Caius Fannius Strabo must not be confounded with the historian of\r\nthe same name. He was consul B.C. 122 with C. Domitius Ahenobarbus.\r\nCicero speaks of an excellent speech of his against the proposal of\r\nGracchus to give the Latins the full citizenship, and the suffrage to\r\nthe Italian allies. (Cic., _Brutus_, c. 26.)\r\n\r\n[103] M. Fulvius Flaccus was consul B.C. 125, and during his year of\r\noffice he defeated the Transalpine Ligurians. He was an orator of no\r\ngreat note, but an active agitator. He perished with Caius Gracchus (c.\r\n16): his house was pulled down, and the ground made public property.\r\n\r\n[104] Plutarch's Life of the younger Scipio Africanus is lost. Scipio\r\ndied B.C. 159, six years before Caius was tribune. He had retired to\r\nrest in the evening with some tablets on which he intended to write a\r\nspeech to deliver before the people on the subject of the Agrarian Law\r\nof Tiberius Gracchus and the difficulties of carrying it into effect. He\r\nwas found dead in the morning, and it was the general opinion that he\r\nwas murdered. His wife Sempronia was suspected, and even Cornelia his\r\nmother-in-law, as well as C. Gracchus. C. Papirius Carbo, one of the\r\ntriumviri for dividing the land with Caius and Fulvius Flaccus is\r\ndistinctly mentioned by Cicero as one of the murderers. As to him, there\r\nis no doubt that he was believed to be guilty. It is also admitted by\r\nall authorities that there was no inquiry into the death of Scipio; and\r\nAppian adds that he had not even a public funeral.\r\n\r\n[105] This was the first Roman colony that was established beyond the\r\nlimits of the Italian Peninsula, which Velleius reckons among the most\r\nimpolitic measures of Gracchus. The colony of Gracchus appears to have\r\nbeen neglected, and the town was not built. At the destruction of\r\nCarthage heavy imprecations were laid on any man who should restore the\r\ncity. The colony was established by Cæsar the Dictator.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of a Roman colony was accompanied with solemn\r\nceremonials, to which Plutarch alludes. The anniversary day of the\r\nfoundation was religiously observed. On some Roman coins there is a\r\nrepresentation of a man driving a yoke of oxen and a vexillum\r\n(standard), which are the symbols of a Roman colony.\r\n\r\n[106] Plutarch has here used the word oligarch ([Greek: oligarchikos]),\r\none who is a friend to the party of the Few as opposed to the Many. The\r\nmeaning of an oligarchy, according to Aristotle (_Politik_, 4, c. 4), is\r\na government in which the rich and those of noble birth possess the\r\npolitical power, being Few in number. But the smallness of the number is\r\nonly an accident: the essence of an oligarchy consists in the power\r\nbeing in the hands of the rich and the noble, who happen in all\r\ncountries to be the Few compared with the Many.\r\n\r\n[107] This was a proverbial expression, of which different explanations\r\nwere given. Sardinia, it is said, was noted for a bitter herb which\r\ncontracted the features of those who tasted it. Pausanias (x. 17) says\r\nit is a plant like parsley, which grows near springs, and causes people\r\nwho eat it to laugh till they die; and he supposes that Homer's\r\nexpression (_Odyssey_ xx. 302), a Sardinian laugh, is an allusion to\r\nthis property of the plant: but this is not a probable explanation of\r\nthe expression in Homer.\r\n\r\n[108] Some fragments of the Letters of Cornelia are extant, but there is\r\ngreat difficulty in determining if they are genuine, and opinions are\r\ndivided on the subject. Gerlach, in his essay on Tiberius and Caius\r\nGracchus (p. 37), maintains their genuineness against the opinion of\r\nSpalding and Bernhardy. The Fragments are collected by Roth.\r\n\r\n[109] The story in Appian (_Civil Wars_, i. 25) is somewhat different.\r\n\r\n[110] The Roman stilus, which Plutarch translates by _graphíum_\r\n([Greek: grapheion]), \"a writing instrument,\" was of metal, iron or\r\nbrass, sharp at one end and flat at the other. The point was used for\r\nwriting on tablets which were smeared with wax: the other end was used\r\nfor erasing what was written and making the surface even again. The word\r\nwas often used by the best Roman writers in a metaphorical sense to\r\nexpress the manner and character of a written composition, and from them\r\nit has passed into some of the modern languages of Europe, our own among\r\nthe rest: thus we speak of a good style, a bad style of writing, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\n[111] The form of the decree was, Videant consules ne quid respublica\r\ndetrimenti capiat (Livius, 3, c. 4), which empowered the consuls or\r\nconsul, as the case might be, to provide that the commonwealth sustained\r\nno damage. The word detrimentum, which signifies damage caused by\r\nrubbing off, had a tacit reference to the majestas of the Populus\r\nRomanus. The majestas (majesty) of the state is its integrity, its\r\nwholeness, any diminution of which was an offence; and under the\r\nEmperors the crime of majestas, that is majestas impaired, was\r\nequivalent to high treason. The decree here alluded to was only adopted,\r\nas Livius expresses it, in the utmost extremity, when the state was in\r\ndanger; its effect was to proclaim martial law, and to suspend for the\r\ntime all the usual forms of proceeding.\r\n\r\n[112] This was one of the hills or eminences in Rome: it was the\r\nplebeian quarter.\r\n\r\n[113] This is the Roman term which corresponds to the _kerukeion_\r\n([Greek: kêrykeion]) of Plutarch, or the staff which ambassadors or\r\nheralds carried in time of war when they were sent to an enemy.\r\n\r\n[114] The Cretans were often employed as mercenaries in the Roman army,\r\nas we see from passages in Livius (37, c. 41).\r\n\r\n[115] This is not Plutarch's word, but it expresses his meaning, and he\r\nuses the word elsewhere. Amnesty is Greek and was used by the later\r\nGreek writers in a sense the same or nearly the same as in modern times,\r\nto express a declaration on the part of those who had the sovereign\r\npower for the time that they would pardon those who had in any way acted\r\nin opposition to such power.\r\n\r\n[116] The Pons Sublicius as it was called, the oldest bridge over the\r\nTiber at Rome.\r\n\r\n[117] As usual in such cases, there is a dispute about the person or at\r\nleast his name. Velleius (ii. 6,) and Aurelius Victor called him\r\nEuporus. Both names are Greek, and the faithful slave was doubtless a\r\nGreek, of whom there were now many at Rome. They were valued for their\r\nsuperior acquirements and dexterity, and filled the higher places in\r\ngreat families. The slaves from barbarous nations, that is, nations not\r\nGreek, were used for meaner purposes.\r\n\r\n[118] Kaltwasser remarks that Aurelius Victor (_De Viris Illustribus_,\r\nc. 55) says that Caius died in the grove of Furina, the goddess of\r\nthieves, whose sacred place was beyond, that is on the west side of the\r\nTiber, and that Plutarch appears to have confounded this with the name\r\nof the Furies, the Greek Erinnyes. This may be so; or Victor may have\r\nmade a mistake, which he often has done.\r\n\r\n[119] Opimius must have been as great a knave as Septimuleius, for the\r\nfraud was palpable. Stories of this kind are generally given with\r\nvariations. Plinius (_N.H._ 33, c. 14) says it was the mouth that was\r\nfilled with lead, and that Septimuleius had been a confidential friend\r\nof Caius. This was the first instance in Rome of head money being\r\noffered and paid; but the example was followed in the proscriptions of\r\nSulla, and those of the triumviri Lepidus, M. Antonius, and Cæsar\r\nOctavianus.\r\n\r\n[120] I have followed Kaltwasser in translating the Greek word [Greek:\r\naponoia], which signifies madness, desperation, or a desperate deed, by\r\ndiscord, for the sake of maintaining something like the opposition\r\nbetween the two words which exists in the original.\r\n\r\n[121] Caius Opimius was consul with Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus, B.C.\r\n121, the year of the death of Caius. The history of his conduct in Libya\r\nis told by Sallustius in the Jugurthine war. He was one of ten\r\ncommissioners who were sent, B.C. 112, to settle the disputes between\r\nAdherbal, the son of Micipsa, and Jugurtha, the illegitimate son of\r\nMicipsa's brother. The commissioners were bribed by Jugurtha and decided\r\nin his favour. Opimius and the rest of them were tried for the offence,\r\nB.C. 109, and banished. Opimius died in great poverty at Dyrrachium\r\n(Durazzo) in Epirus. (Sallustius, _Jugurthine War_, c. 134; Velleius,\r\nii. 7.) Cicero thinks that Opimius was very hardly used after his\r\nservices in crushing the insurrection at Fregellæ and putting down the\r\ndisturbances excited by Caius Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus: he calls him\r\nthe saviour of the state, and laments his condemnation. (Cicero, _Pro\r\nPlancio_, c. 28, &c.; _Brutus_, c. 34; &c.)\r\n\r\n[122] M. Fulvius Flaccus was consul, B.C. 125, during which year he\r\ndefeated the Transalpine Ligurians.\r\n\r\n[123] The legislation of the Gracchi, particularly of Caius Gracchus,\r\ncomprehended many objects, the provisions as to which are comprehended\r\nunder the general name of Semproniæ Leges, for it was the fashion to\r\nname a law after the gentile name of him who proposed it. The most\r\nimportant of the measures of Caius have been mentioned by Plutarch, with\r\nthe exception of a law about the provinces. At the outbreak of the\r\nSocial War, B.C. 91, the Roman provinces comprehended Sardinia, Corsica,\r\nSicily, the Spanish Peninsula, the whole of which, however, was not\r\nsubdued, Cisalpine Gaul, Asia, Macedonia, Achæa, Transalpine Gaul, and\r\nsome others of less note.\r\n\r\nThe original sense of the word provincia had no reference to a\r\nterritory, though this is the later sense of the word and the common\r\nusage of it. The functions of the prætor urbanus who stayed at Rome were\r\ncalled his provincia, that is, the administration of justice was his\r\nprovincia or business. The word is used in the sense of a function or\r\noffice by Livius with reference to a time when there was no provincia in\r\nthe later sense of the word. In the time of Cicero, provincia signified\r\na territory out of Italy, which was administered by a Roman governor.\r\nThe term Italy, at this time, did not comprise the whole peninsula, but\r\nonly that part which was south of the rivers Rubico and Macra. The\r\nprimary meaning of the word is confirmed by its etymology; provincia is\r\na shortened form of providentia, which also appears in the shape\r\nprudentia. Providentia signifies \"foresight,\" \"superintending care,\" and\r\nso forth; and it is formed on the same principle as beneficentia,\r\nbenevolentia, and other Latin words which are of a participial\r\ncharacter. The etymology of Niebuhr (proventus) is untenable, and that\r\nwhich I have partly adopted (Smith's _Dict. of Antiquities_, art.\r\n\"Provincia\") is no better. Since writing that article, I saw that the\r\nword is only another form of providentia, and a friend has pointed out\r\nto me that Mr. G. C. Lewis first suggested this as the origin of the\r\nword in his Essay on the Government of Dependencies, London, 1841, Note\r\nH. p. 353. If this explanation of the word is correct, the true\r\northography is provintia, but I have not yet been able to find it on an\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nThe old practice was for the Senate, after the elections of the Consuls\r\nand Prætors, to name two provinces which should be given to the consuls\r\nafter the consulship was expired. The two consuls settled by lot or by\r\nagreement which province of the two they should have. As the consuls\r\nwere chosen before the two consular provinces were determined by the\r\nsenate, it was in the power of the senate to give what provinces they\r\npleased to the consuls, and so make the appointment either a favour or\r\nnot. A law of Gracchus enacted that the two consular provinces should be\r\ndetermined before the election of consuls, and that the senate should\r\nnot have the power, which they had formerly exercised, of prolonging a\r\nman's government in a province beyond the year. This law manifestly\r\nlimited the power of the Senate, though some writers conceive that it\r\nwas enacted for the advantage of that body as some compensation for\r\ntheir loss of the judicial power.\r\n\r\nPlutarch has treated the subject of the Gracchi with perfect\r\nimpartiality. He has given them credit for good motives, and approved of\r\ntheir measures in general, but he has not disguised their faults. Appian\r\nconsidered that the measures of Tiberius were for the public good, but\r\nthat his conduct was not judicious. Sallustius also admits that the\r\nGracchi did not conduct themselves with sufficient moderation\r\n(_Jugurthine War_, c. 46); but Sallustius belonged to the popular party,\r\nand he approved of their measures. Most of the other Roman writers\r\nexpress an unfavourable opinion of the Gracchi. Florus however gives\r\nthem credit for good intentions, but disapproves of the means by which\r\nthey attempted to carry their measures into effect. That part of the\r\nwork of Livius which treated of this period is lost, but we may collect\r\nhis opinions of the Gracchi from the Epitomes of the lost books, and the\r\ngeneral tenor of his History. The measures of the Gracchi were estimated\r\nby the rule of party spirit. The judgment of Cicero, who often mentions\r\nthe Gracchi, is both for and against. His expressed opinion, whatever\r\nmight be his real opinion, varied with circumstances. If we only knew\r\nhis opinion from the second oration against the Agrarian Law of Rullus\r\n(ii. 5), we should consider him as approving of all the measures of the\r\nGracchi. When he delivered that oration, Cicero had just been elected\r\nConsul: he was a Novus homo, a new man as the Romans called him, who was\r\nthe first of his family to attain to the high honours of the State, and\r\nhe had obtained the consulship as a friend of the people, as a popular\r\nman (Popularis). In his treatise on Friendship and other of his\r\nwritings, he gives a contradictory judgment of the Gracchi; he says that\r\nTiberius Gracchus aimed at the kingly power, or rather in fact was king\r\nfor a few months; he calls the two Gracchi degenerate sons of their\r\nfather; he extols the murderers of Tiberius Gracchus; he commiserates\r\nthe hard fate of Opimius after saving the state by putting Caius\r\nGracchus to death. All this was written or said after he was consul,\r\nafter he had done what the murderers of the Gracchi had done, after he\r\nhad put to death Catilina and his accomplices without trial contrary to\r\nthe constitution, contrary to a special law which Caius Gracchus had\r\ncarried that no Roman citizen should be put to death without a duly\r\nconstituted trial; after he had, like Nasica and Opimius, made himself a\r\nmurderer by putting men to death without letting them be tried according\r\nto law; whether they were guilty or not, is immaterial; they were put to\r\ndeath without trial, contrary to a principle of justice which, before he\r\nbecame guilty himself, Cicero had maintained and defended. The acts of\r\nthe Gracchi were on record and well understood; but Cicero made his\r\nopinion of their acts depend not on his convictions, but on his\r\ninterests; it is to him mainly that we may trace the common notion that\r\nthe Gracchi were merely a couple of designing demagogues. The Gracchi\r\nwere not wise enough or firm enough to be good reformers, but few\r\nreformers in so difficult a situation have left behind them so fair a\r\nreputation for honest intention. There was a great mass of contemporary\r\nmaterials for the history of the Gracchi, consisting of the speeches of\r\nthe two brothers, of the numerous speeches made against them, the\r\nhistory of Polybius, who could not have overlooked the Gracchi in his\r\naccount of the Numantine war, the history of Fannius, and other\r\nmaterials which Gerlach has enumerated in his Essay on the Gracchi. It\r\nis plain from Plutarch's narrative, that he used these authorities; and\r\nif we consider how far removed he was from the time of the Gracchi, and\r\nhis character, we may conclude that he has given as impartial a view of\r\nthe times as he could collect from contemporary evidence. He may have\r\nmade mistakes, and some mistakes we cannot help considering that he has\r\nmade; but he can hardly have made any mistake in his representation of\r\nthe nature of the reforms which the two brothers attempted, of the\r\nopposition that they encountered, and of their general character.\r\n\r\n_Misenum._ Misenum was on the coast of Campania near Cape Miseno, a\r\nfavourite residence of the wealthy Romans, who built villas there. The\r\nhouse of Cornelia had many occupants. It became the property of Caius\r\nMarius (c. 34), then of Lucius Lucullus, and finally of the Emperor\r\nTiberius, who died here. It was seated on a hill which commanded an\r\nextensive sea-view.\r\n\r\nIn the last sentence of this chapter I have adopted the reading of\r\nSintenis ([Greek: phylattomenês]), which is necessary for the sense.\r\n\r\n[124] Alluding to the fight of Herakles with the Lernæan hydra which had\r\nnine heads. Herakles struck off its heads with his club, but in the\r\nplace of the head he cut off, two new heads grew forth each time.\r\n\r\n[125] This was a frontier town, whose possession was disputed by the\r\nAthenians and Boeotians.\r\n\r\n[126] An Athenian of the township of Thriasia, near Eleusis.\r\n\r\n[127] A fellow-scholar of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\n[128] A low quarter of Athens.\r\n\r\n[129] See Life of Crassus, ch. 2.\r\n\r\n[130] The battle of Chæronea, B.C. 338, in which Philip defeated the\r\nAthenians and Boeotians, and crushed the liberties of Greece.\r\n\r\n[131] The hero of a mock-heroic poem supposed to have been written by\r\nHomer.\r\n\r\n[132] Kassander built a new city on the site of Potidæa, on the narrow\r\nisthmus of the promontory of Pallene. Potidæa had been destroyed by\r\nPhilip, B.C. 356. The new city of Kassandrea soon became the most\r\nflourishing city in Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[133] This was Agis III. who at the time of the battle of Issus, B.C.\r\n333, was communicating with the Persian naval commanders in the Ægean,\r\nto obtain supplies for the war against the Macedonians. He was killed in\r\naction, about the time of the battle of Arbela, B.C. 331.\r\n\r\n[134] The second month of the Attic year, the latter half of August and\r\nfirst of September. The two next months mentioned in the text correspond\r\nto the latter half of September and the first of October and the latter\r\nhalf of October and first of November respectively.\r\n\r\n[135] A small island in the Saronic Gulf off the coast of Argolis and\r\nopposite Troezen, where was a celebrated temple of Poseidon which was\r\nregarded as an inviolable asylum. Hither Demosthenes fled to avoid\r\nAntipater, and here he took poison, B.C. 322.\r\n\r\n[136] The Greek word signifies a reed, in the upper part of which poison\r\nmight easily be placed.\r\n\r\n[137] A festival in honour of Demeter. For details see Smith 'Dict. of\r\nAntiq.'\r\n\r\n[138] The Helvia Gens was plebeian. It becomes historical from the time\r\nof the second Punic war, and became ennobled (nobilis) by M. Helvius\r\nbeing elected prætor B.C. 197, the first year in which six prætors were\r\nelected (Liv. 32. c. 27). It is said that Cicero never mentions his\r\nmother in his writings, but an anecdote of her careful housekeeping is\r\nrecorded by her son Quintus (Cic. _Ad Diversos_, xvi. 26).\r\n\r\nThe allusion is to the Volscian with whom Coriolanus took refuge when he\r\nleft Rome (Plutarch, _Life of Coriolanus_, c. 22; Livy, 2, c. 35).\r\n\r\n[139] Cicero himself did not claim any illustrious descent. The family\r\nhad been long settled at Arpinum, now Arpino, a Volscian town. The first\r\nperson who is mentioned as bearing the name of Cicero is C. Claudius\r\nCicero, a tribunus plebis, B.C. 454 (Liv. 3. c. 31). M. Tullius Cicero,\r\nthe grandfather of the orator, was born B.C. 140, and nothing is known\r\nof the orator's family before him. Arpinum received the limited Roman\r\ncivitas in B.C. 303 (Liv. 10. c. 1), that is, probably Commercium and\r\nConnubium, for the suffrage (suffragii latio) was not given to the\r\npeople of Arpinum till B.C. 188 (Liv. 38. c. 36). The orator's\r\ngrandfather lived to see his grandson born B.C. 106. Cicero's father\r\nbelonged to the class of Equites. He spent the greater part of his life\r\non his lands at Arpinum, near the junction of the Fibrenus with the\r\nLiris (Garigliano). He afterwards removed to Rome to educate his sons\r\nMarcus and Quintus, and had a house in the Carinæ. Among his friends\r\nwere the orators M. Antonius and Lucius Crassus, and Q. Scævola the\r\nAugur, a distinguished Jurist. His sons had accordingly the advantage of\r\nbeing acquainted in their youth with some of the most distinguished of\r\nthe Romans. He is said to have died B.C. 64, the year before his son was\r\nconsul. A letter of Cicero to Atticus (i. 6) is generally supposed to\r\nspeak of his father's death, but the true reading is undoubtedly \"pater\r\na nobis discessit;\" and it is plain that Cicero is simply speaking of\r\nhis father leaving Rome for a time (Drumann, _Tullii_, p. 213).\r\n\r\n[140] The cognomen Cicero, as already observed, occurs early in Roman\r\nhistory. Many of the Roman cognomina were derived from some particular\r\nplant which a man cultivated, or from some personal peculiarity, or from\r\nsome other accidental circumstance. The mark on the nose is just as\r\nlikely to be the origin of the name as the cultivation of the _cicer_;\r\nfor if the name Fabius comes from _faba_, \"a bean,\" and Lentulus, from\r\n_lens_, \"pulse;\" yet Catulus means \"a whelp,\" and Scaurus means\r\n\"knock-knee'd,\" or something of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe words [Greek: diastolê, diaphyê] mean what I have translated them.\r\nKaltwasser has translated the passage thus, according to Reiske's\r\nexplanation:--\"Jener hatte an der spitze der nase einen kleinen anwuchs\r\noder warze in form einer solchen erbse, woven er den beinamen erhielt.\"\r\nBut this is not a translation. Plutarch does not say that he had a wart\r\nat the end of his nose, but that the end of his nose was like a vetch,\r\nbecause there was a kind of split or cleft in it. There is no reason for\r\nmisrepresenting even a man's nose.\r\n\r\n[141] The \"third day of the new calends\" is the third of January of the\r\nunreformed Roman calendar. Pompeius Magnus was born in the same year,\r\nB.C. 106. Cicero himself mentions his birthday (_Ad Attic._ vii. 5;\r\nxiii. 42). Plutarch's stories of his aptitude for learning might be\r\ncollected from the mass of anecdotes that existed in his time about all\r\nthe great Romans of Cicero's period. The story shows at least what were\r\nthe traditional stories about Cicero's youth.\r\n\r\n[142] Kaltwasser refers to the passage in Plato's Republic, book v. p.\r\n56, of the Bipont edition.\r\n\r\n[143] Glaucus was a fisherman of Anthedon in Boeotia. After eating of a\r\ncertain herb he jumped into the sea and became a sea-god with the power\r\nof prophecy (Pausanias, ix. 22). Strabo (p. 405, ed. Casaub.) says that\r\nhe became a fish of some kind ([Greek: kêtos]), a change more\r\nappropriate to his new element, though perhaps not to his new vocation.\r\nÆschylus made a drama on the subject, which Cicero may have used.\r\n\r\n[144] Cicero translated the poem of Aratus into Latin verse. He also\r\nwrote an epic poem, the subject of which was his countryman Caius\r\nMarius; and one on his own consulship, which was always a favourite\r\ntopic with him. Of the translation of the 'Phænomena' of Aratus, which\r\nwas made when he was a youth, about four hundred lines remain. The\r\nfragments of these poems, and of others not here enumerated, are in\r\nOrelli's edition of Cicero, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[145] Philo, a pupil of the Carthaginian Clitomachus, fled from Athens\r\nto Rome in B.C. 88, at the time when the troops of Mithridates were in\r\npossession of Athens (Cicero, _Brutus_, c. 89, and Meyer's note).\r\n\r\n[146] The elder of these Mucii was Q. Mucius Scævola, Consul B.C. 117,\r\ncommonly called the Augur. After his death Cicero attached himself to Q.\r\nMucius Scævola, Pontifex Maximus, who was a distinguished jurist. The\r\nPontifex was assassinated in the consulship of the younger Marius, B.C.\r\n82, in the temple of Vesta (Florus, iii. 21). Cicero has in several\r\nplaces commemorated his virtues and talents (_De Orat._ i. 39; iii. 3).\r\n\r\nCicero, in his _Brutus_, c. 88, &c., has given an account of his own\r\nearly studies.\r\n\r\n[147] In B.C. 89 Cicero served under Cn. Pompeius Strabo, the father of\r\nPompeius Magnus (Life of Pompeius, c. 1. notes). Cicero speaks of this\r\nevent of his life in his twelfth Philippic, c. 11.\r\n\r\n[148] L. Cornelius Chrysogonus was probably a Greek. His name Cornelius\r\nwas derived from his patron (Life of Sulla, c. 31, notes). Cicero's\r\nspeech for Sextus Roscius Amerinus was spoken B.C. 80; it is still\r\nextant. Cicero's first extant speech, pro P. Quintio, was spoken B.C.\r\n81.\r\n\r\n[149] Cicero went to Greece B.C. 79. The reasons for his journey are\r\nstated by himself in his _Brutus_ (c. 91). He speaks of his leanness and\r\nweakness, and of the length and slenderness of his neck. His physicians\r\nrecommended him to give up speaking for a time. When he left Rome he had\r\nbeen engaged for two years in pleading causes.\r\n\r\n[150] Cicero stayed six months at Athens. The New Academy was founded by\r\nArkesilaus. The school taught that certainty was not attainable in\r\nanything, and that the evidence of the senses was deceptive. The words\r\n\"by the evidence and by the senses\" are the exact copy of the original.\r\nSchaefer proposes to omit \"and\" ([Greek: kai]), in which case the\r\npassage would stand thus--\"by the evidence of the senses.\" Sintenis\r\nretains the conjunction ([Greek: kai]), and refers to Cicero, _Academ._\r\n2. 6 and 7.\r\n\r\n[151] Cicero was at Rhodes in B.C. 78 (compare his _Brutus_, c. 91).\r\nCicero calls this \"Apollonius the son of Molo,\" simply Molo (see the\r\nLife of Cæsar, c. 3, notes). Molo had the two most distinguished of the\r\nRomans among his pupils, C. Julius Cæsar and Cicero.\r\n\r\nPoseidonius was the chief Stoic of his time.\r\n\r\n[152] Cicero never mentions this visit to Delphi in his writings, and\r\nMiddleton thinks the visit is improbable, because Cicero (_De\r\nDivinatione_, ii. 56) shows that he knew what was the value of the\r\noracle. But a man who despises a popular superstition may try to use it\r\nfor his purposes, and may be disappointed if he cannot. Perhaps the\r\nsoundness of the oracle's advice may be a good reason for disbelieving\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\nCicero returned to Rome in B.C. 77.\r\n\r\n[153] This was Q. Roscius, in whose behalf Cicero made a speech in B.C.\r\n76, before C. Piso as judex. The subject of the cause is stated in the\r\narguments to the oration.\r\n\r\nClaudius Æsopus, the great tragic actor, whom Cicero considered a\r\nperfect master of his art, was probably a Greek and a freedman of some\r\nmember of the Claudia Gens. He was liberal in his expenditure, and yet\r\nhe acquired an enormous fortune, which his son spent.\r\n\r\n[154] [Greek: ek tou hypokrinesthai], that is, from \"acting.\" One Greek\r\nword for actor is [Greek: hypokritês]. Oratorical action was therefore\r\nviewed as a part of the histrionic art; and so it is. But oratorical\r\nacting requires to be kept within narrower limits.\r\n\r\n[155] Bawling is properly viewed as an effort to accomplish by loudness\r\nof voice what ought to be accomplished by other means. It is simply\r\nridiculous, and misses the mark that it aims at. \"If you mouth it,\" says\r\nHamlet to the players, \"as many of your players do, I had as lief the\r\ntown crier had spoke my lines.\"--\"Let your discretion be your tutor: suit\r\nthe action to the word, and the word to the action; with this special\r\nobservance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature.\"\r\n\r\n[156] Cicero was elected quæstor B.C. 76, when he was thirty years of\r\nage. He discharged the duties of his office during B.C. 75. He speaks\r\nwell of his own quæstorship in his oration for Cn. Plancius (c. 26).\r\n\r\n[157] Cicero tells the story himself in his oration for Cn. Plancius (c.\r\n26). The place of the adventure was Puteoli (Pozzuoli), B.C. 74, a place\r\nto which the Romans used to resort to enjoy the natural hot springs and\r\nthe agreeable neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[158] Verres during his prætorship in Sicily, B.C. 73-71, had greatly\r\nmisconducted himself. He was prosecuted in B.C. 70, in which year\r\nPompeius Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus were consuls (Life of Crassus,\r\nc. 12). Hortensius, the orator, defended Verres. The object of\r\nHortensius and of these prætors was to prolong or defer the trial to\r\nthe next year, for which Hortensius was elected consul.\r\n\r\nThere are extant seven orations of Cicero on the matter of Verres, of\r\nwhich two only were delivered; that against Cæcilius (_De Divinatione_),\r\nwho claimed to conduct the prosecution, his object being to get Verres\r\noff, and the Actio Prima, which is an opening of the whole case. Before\r\nthe other speeches were delivered, Verres gave up his defence and went\r\ninto exile. Cicero, however, published the speeches, or probably even\r\nwrote them entire after the affair was over.\r\n\r\nThis Cæcilius was Q. Cæcilius Metellus, a Sicilian by birth, and\r\nprobably the descendant of a freedman of one of the Metelli. It seems\r\nthat he was suspected of being of Jewish origin. Cicero's allusion to\r\nthe hog, and many other passages in the Roman writers, show that the\r\nJews were well known in Rome at this time.\r\n\r\n[159] [Greek: entos thyrôn], \"within doors.\" Kaltwasser has translated\r\nthe passage: \"So solltest du hinter der thür mit deinen söhnen\r\nschmälen.\" The repartee does not admit or need explanation.\r\n\r\n[160] The story of the monster sphinx and her ænigma which OEdipus solved\r\nis well known. This work of art was of metal, according to Pliny (_Hist.\r\nNat._ 34. c. 18).\r\n\r\n[161] There is probably some error in Plutarch as to the amount. In the\r\nDivinatio (c. 5) the peculations of Verres were estimated at \"millies\r\nHS.,\" or one hundred millions of sesterces; but in the Actio Prima (c.\r\n18), which was spoken after Cicero had been in Sicily to collect\r\nevidence, he put the amount at forty millions of sesterces, or\r\ntwo-fifths of the first sum. If Plutarch's drachmæ are Roman denarii,\r\nhis 750,000 drachmæ will make only three millions of sesterces.\r\n\r\nVerres continued in exile, and he remained quiet during the civil wars.\r\nThough an unprincipled scoundrel, he showed his taste in stealing: he\r\nhad kept many valuable objects of art, and he would not part with them.\r\nThe story is that M. Antonius put his name in the proscription list,\r\nB.C. 43, because he would not give up his Corinthian vessels. He was put\r\nto death, but he died, it is said, with great resolution; and he had the\r\nsatisfaction of hearing that his old enemy Cicero had gone before him\r\n(Drumann, _Tullii_, p. 328). But all this story is very improbable.\r\n\r\n[162] Cicero was Curule Ædile in B.C. 69, with M. Cæsonius for his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n[163] This is evidently a mistake in Plutarch's text. Arpinum is meant.\r\n\r\n[164] This is what Cicero calls his Pompeianum. Middleton, in his Life\r\nof Cicero, has mentioned all Cicero's country residences in Italy, which\r\nwere very numerous.\r\n\r\n[165] See the Life of Cato, c. 19. The time of Cicero's marriage is\r\nuncertain. Drumann conjectures that he married her about B.C. 80 or 79,\r\nbefore his journey to Asia.\r\n\r\n[166] Cicero was Prætor in the year B.C. 66, and it fell to his lot to\r\npreside at the trials for Repetundæ. This Macer was C. Licinius Macer.\r\nAfter he had been prætor he had a province, and during his\r\nadministration he was guilty of illegal practices, for which he was\r\ntried and convicted (Cic. _Ad Attic._ i. 4). Crassus, who also belonged\r\nto the Licinia Gens, felt some sympathy for a man whose crime was\r\ngetting money by unlawful means. Macer was an orator and a writer. A few\r\nfragments of his Annals (Krause, _Vitæ et Fragm. Vet. Histor. Rom._) are\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n[167] P. Vatinius was afterwards consul B.C. 47. There is extant a\r\nspeech of Cicero against him, in which of course he has a very bad\r\ncharacter given to him. Kaltwasser says that a thick neck was considered\r\nby the Romans as a sign of a shameless man, and he refers to the Life of\r\nMarius, c. 29, where a like expression is used. Cicero's neck, according\r\nto his own account, was very thin, and he thought it no good sign of his\r\nstrength. However this may be as to the thickness of the neck of\r\nVatinius, it was clearly not a thing that he could alter.\r\n\r\n[168] C. Manilius, a Tribunus Plebis, had in this same year proposed and\r\ncarried the law which gave Pompeius the command in the Mithridatic war,\r\nand Cicero had supported the measure in a speech which is extant (Life\r\nof Pompeius, c. 30). This story of the accusation and defence of\r\nManilius is unintelligible. C. Orchinius presided at the trials for\r\npeculatus, and Manilius should have been brought before him (Cic. _Pro\r\nCluentio_, c. 53). See Dion Cassius, 36, c. 27; and Drumann's remarks,\r\n_Tullii_, p. 375.\r\n\r\n[169] Cicero was consul in B.C. 63 with C. Antonius. As to the affair of\r\nCatiline, see the Lives of Cæsar and Cato, and the notes; and Drumann,\r\n_Tullii_, p. 385, &c.\r\n\r\n[170] See the Life of Sulla, c. 32.\r\n\r\n[171] Sallust (_Bell. Catilin._ c. 22) tells a story somewhat to the\r\nsame effect, of the conspirators drinking of human blood, but he does\r\nnot believe the story, and perhaps few people will.\r\n\r\n[172] The measure to which Plutarch alludes was the Agrarian Law of the\r\ntribune P. Servilius Rullus. Cicero made three speeches against the\r\nproposal, which are extant, and he defeated the scheme.\r\n\r\n[173] C. Antonius went as governor to Macedonia in B.C. 62, where he\r\ntook the opportunity of getting all the money that he could. He gave it\r\nout that Cicero was to have a share of it. The evidence of such an\r\nunprincipled man is not worth much; but one of Cicero's letters to\r\nAtticus (i. 12), which he never expected would be read by anybody else,\r\nshows that he knew there was such a rumour; and the manner in which he\r\ntreats it is perfectly incomprehensible. A certain Hilarus, a freedman\r\nof Cicero, was then with Antonius in Macedonia, as Cicero was informed,\r\nand Cicero was also informed that Antonius declared that Cicero was to\r\nhave some of the money that he was getting, and that Hilarus had been\r\nsent by Cicero to look after his share. Cicero was a good deal troubled,\r\nas he says, though he did not believe the report; yet, he adds, there\r\nwas certainly some talk. Cn. Plancius was named to Cicero as the\r\nauthority for the report. Atticus is requested to examine into the\r\nmatter, and--not to apply to Antonius or to Plancius--but to get the\r\nrascal (Hilarus) out of those parts, if in any way he can. This is a\r\nmode of proceeding that is quite inconsistent with perfect innocence on\r\nthe part of Cicero. There was something between him and Antonius. Cicero\r\nsays that if Antonius should be recalled, as was expected, he could not\r\nfor his character's sake defend the man; and what is more, he says, he\r\nfelt no inclination; and then he proceeds to tell Atticus about this\r\nawkward report. Yet Cicero did defend Antonius (B.C. 59) and Antonius\r\nwas convicted.\r\n\r\n[174] It appears from Cicero's oration for Murena, c. 19, that his name\r\nwas Lucius Roscius Otho, and he was not Prætor, but Tribunus Plebis.\r\nThis Lex Roscia was enacted B.C. 67, in the consulship of M. Acilius\r\nGlabrio and C. Calpurnius Piso (Dion Cassius, 36. c. 25). His law gave to\r\nthe equites and those who had the equestrian census a select place of\r\nfourteen rows at the public spectacles, which were next to the seats of\r\nthe senators. This unpopular measure was that which Cicero now spoke in\r\nfavour of (_Ad. Attic._ ii. 1). Cicero's oration is lost, but a passage\r\nis preserved, says Kaltwasser, by Macrobius (_Saturnalia_ ii. 10). Some\r\nalso suppose, as Kaltwasser says, that Virgil alludes to it in the\r\npassage in the Æneid (i. 152). There is no extract from this oration in\r\nMacrobius, who appears to suppose that Cicero made an oration to rebuke\r\nthe people for making a disturbance while Roscius, the player, was\r\nacting.\r\n\r\n[175] As to the conspiracy, see the Lives of Cæsar and Cato, and the\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n[176] His name was C. Manlius Acidinus. There is no reason for saying\r\nthat his true name was Mallius: that was merely a Greek form of Manlius.\r\nHe fell in the battle in which Catiline's troops were defeated.\r\n\r\n[177] Cicero has recorded this answer of Catiline in his oration for\r\nMurena, c. 25: \"duo corpora esse in republica, unum debile, _infirmo_\r\ncapite, alterum firmum, sine capite: huic, cum ita de se meritum esset,\r\ncaput se vivo non defuturum.\" Cicero makes Catiline say that the weak\r\nbody had a weak head. Cicero's version of what he said is obviously the\r\ntrue one.\r\n\r\n[178] Decimus Junius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena were consuls for the\r\nyear B.C. 62. As to the trial of Murena for bribery at the elections\r\n(ambitus), see the Life of Cato, c. 21.\r\n\r\n[179] This affair is not mentioned by Sallustius in his history of the\r\nconspiracy of Catiline. The usual form in which the Senate gave this\r\nextraordinary power is mentioned by Sallustius (c. 29): \"dent operam\r\nconsules nequid Res Publica detrimenti capiat.\"\r\n\r\n[180] The assassins, according to Sallustius, were C. Cornelius and L.\r\nVargunteius. See the note of Drumann, _Tullii_, p. 457: \"Plutarch hunted\r\nin his authorities only after anecdotes and traits of character in order\r\nto paint his heroes: the names of the subordinate persons were\r\nindifferent to him; with such frivolous and one-sided views he could not\r\nfail to confound persons.\" \"Frivolous,\" is perhaps hardly the\r\ntranslation of Drumann's \"leichtsinnig,\" but it comes pretty near to it.\r\nAnd yet the fact of the design to assassinate is the main feature in the\r\nhistory: the actors in the intended assassination are subordinate to the\r\ndesign. A painstaking compiler is entitled to grumble at such a blunder,\r\nbut Plutarch does not merit reproach in these terms.\r\n\r\n[181] She was a mistress or something of the kind of one Q. Curius.\r\nWhether Curius sent her to Cicero or she went of her own accord is\r\ndoubtful. Perhaps she expected to get something for her information.\r\nSallustius, c. 23. 28, speaks of this affair; and Cicero, _Catilin._ i.\r\nc. 9.\r\n\r\n[182] Plutarch, as Kaltwasser observes, appears to refer to the words of\r\nCicero (_Catilin._ i. c. 5): \"magno me metu liberabis, dum modo inter me\r\natque te murus intersit.\" Catiline left Rome on the night of the 8th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n[183] L. Cornelius Lentulus Sura was consul B.C. 71. He had been put out\r\nof the Senate by the censors for his irregular life. His restoration to\r\nhis rank and the matter of the prætorship are mentioned by Dion Cassius\r\n(37, c. 30, and the note of Reimarus). The meaning of the story about\r\nthe ball is obvious enough; but Lentulus was not the first who had the\r\nname Sura, and Plutarch's story is so far untrue. See Drumann's note on\r\nthe name Sura, _Cornelii_, p. 530.\r\n\r\n[184] See the Lives of Marius and Sulla.\r\n\r\n[185] It was a period of festivity, and considered suitable for the\r\npurpose of the conspirators. See the Life of Pompeius, c. 34, notes.\r\n\r\n[186] The narrative of Sallustius, as to the proposed burning of the\r\ncity, is somewhat different (_Bell. Catil._ c. 43).\r\n\r\n[187] The Allobroges were a Celtic tribe of Gallia, on the Rhone. They\r\nbelonged to the division of Gallia which under Augustus was called\r\nGallia Narbonensis. Their chief town was Vienna, now Vienne. According\r\nto Cæsar's description (_Bell. Gall._ i. 6.) the Rhodanus in the upper\r\npart of its course separated the Helvetii from the Allobroges. The\r\nremotest town of the Allobroges, on the side of the Helvetii, was\r\nGeneva. Cæsar describes the Allobroges as recently (B.C. 58) brought to\r\nfriendly terms with the Romans.\r\n\r\n[188] This Titus of Croton is named Titus Volturcius by Sallustius.\r\n\r\n[189] The Senate met on the third of December of the unreformed calendar\r\nin the temple of Concord, on the Capitoline Hill.\r\n\r\n[190] See the Life of Cæsar, c. 9, and the notes.\r\n\r\n[191] Compare Dion Cassius, 37, c. 35. Fabia, the sister of Terentia,\r\nwas one of the Vestals, and Drumann supposes that this fact confirms his\r\nsupposition that Cicero had arranged all this affair with his wife, in\r\norder to work on the popular opinion. Middleton made the same\r\nsupposition a long time ago. It requires no great penetration to make\r\nsuch a conjecture; but it may not be true.\r\n\r\n[192] It is said that this does not appear in any of Cicero's extant\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\n[193] The Senate assembled on the fourth of December in the temple of\r\nConcord; and again on the fifth to pass judgment on the conspirators. As\r\nto the speeches delivered on the occasion, see the Lives of Cæsar and\r\nCato, and the notes. The whole matter of the conspiracy is treated with\r\ngreat minuteness and tedious prolixity by Drumann (_Tullii_, under the\r\nyear B.C. 63).\r\n\r\n[194] I believe that I have translated this correctly. I suppose that\r\nPlutarch means to say, that if Cæsar had been accused as a member of the\r\nconspiracy, he would have been acquitted, and the conspirators would\r\nhave had a chance of escaping also. There was no chance of securing the\r\ncondemnation of the conspirators and involving Cæsar in their fate. On\r\nthe contrary, if Cæsar was accused, all might escape. It was better,\r\ntherefore, not to touch him. Kaltwasser has made the passage\r\nunintelligible. The explanation of Coraës, as corrected by Schäfer, is\r\nright.\r\n\r\n[195] Sallustius (_Bell. Cat._ c. 51, &c.) states Cæsar's proposal to\r\nhave been the confiscation of the property of the conspirators and their\r\nperpetual confinement in the chief municipia of Italy, and that the\r\nSenate should make a declaration that any man who proposed to set them\r\nat liberty, or to mitigate their punishment, should be considered an\r\nenemy of the State. Cicero (_In Catilin._ iv. 5) states the opinion of\r\nCæsar to the same effect. Cæsar had urged the illegality of condemning\r\nRoman citizens to death without a trial, and this was provided by a Lex\r\nSempronia of C. Gracchus. But Cicero replies that Cææar's measure was as\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n[196] The speech which he delivered on the occasion is the fourth\r\noration against Catiline. Some critics maintain that it is not genuine.\r\nDrumann, who maintains that it is, has a long note on the subject\r\n(_Tullii_, p. 512).\r\n\r\n[197] Plutarch likens the feelings of the youth at the sight of the\r\nprisoners being led to execution to the solemn ceremonies of initiation\r\nin some mysterious rites. The conspirators were taken to the only prison\r\nthat Rome then had, the Tullianum, where they were strangled. Five men\r\nwere put to death. Nine had been condemned to death, but four had\r\nescaped being seized. Appian (_Civil Wars_, ii. 6) seems to say that\r\nCicero saw the men put to death. If he did not see the execution, we may\r\nsafely assume that he took care to see that the men really were dead.\r\nTheir bodies were delivered to their kinsfolk for interment.\r\n\r\n[198] Antonius did not command in the battle. He was ill, or pretended\r\nto be ill. His legatus, Petreius, an able officer, commanded the troops.\r\nThe battle was fought early in B.C. 62, probably near Pistoria (Pistoia)\r\nin Etruria. It was a bloody struggle, hand to hand, and the loss on the\r\nvictorious side was great. Dion says that Antonius sent the head of\r\nCatilina to Rome. According to Roman usage, he was entitled to the\r\nhonour of the victory, because Petreius was his inferior officer.\r\n\r\n[199] Metellus Nepos and the other tribunes began to exercise their\r\nfunctions on the tenth of December. The consuls began to exercise their\r\nfunctions on the first of January. The oath that Cicero had to swear\r\nwas, that he had obeyed the laws. He alludes to the oath that he did\r\nswear on the last day of December on giving up his office, in a letter\r\nto Q. Metellus Celer, the brother of Nepos (_Ad Diversos_, v. 2), and in\r\nhis oration against Piso, c. 3. Manutius (_Comment. in_ Cic. Ep. _Ad\r\nDivers._ v. 2) shows that Bestia was a tribune during Cicero's\r\nconsulship, and as he had gone out of office on the ninth of December he\r\ncould not have acted with Metellus on the thirty-first of December.\r\n\r\nAs to Metellus Nepos, see the Life of Cato, c. 20.\r\n\r\n[200] It is said that this does not occur in the extant letters of\r\nCicero.\r\n\r\n[201] In the beginning of his treatise De Officiis, which is addressed\r\nto his son, then at Athens (B.C. 44), Cicero speaks of the youth having\r\nthen been a year under the instruction of Kratippus. Kratippus was a\r\nnative of Mitylene, and he was living there when Pompeius touched at the\r\nisland after the battle of Pharsalia (Life of Pompeius, c. 75). Cicero's\r\nson was attached to his master, and in an extant letter to Tiro (Cic.\r\n_Ad Diversos_, xvii. 21) he expresses his affection for him. Kratippus\r\nwas more than a philosopher: he was a pleasant companion, and perhaps\r\nyoung Cicero liked his table-talk as much as his philosophy.\r\n\r\n[202] He is mentioned by Cicero in his Letters to Atticus (xiv. 16, 18,\r\nand xv. 16).\r\n\r\n[203] Cicero, in the letter to Tiro (xvi. 21) above referred to, says\r\nthat Gorgias was useful to him in his declamatory exercises, but he had\r\ndismissed him in obedience to his father's positive command.\r\n\r\n[204] It does not appear which of the Munatii this was.\r\n\r\n[205] Crassus could not well misunderstand the Stoical doctrine, but he\r\nappears to have purposely expressed himself as if the Stoics considered\r\n\"rich\" and \"good\" as convertible terms. Cicero's repartee implies that\r\n\"good\" is the more comprehensive term: Crassus therefore was not \"good,\"\r\nbecause he was \"rich.\"\r\n\r\n[206] This is a frigid joke. Axius in Greek ([Greek: axios]) signifies\r\n\"worthy;\" and Cicero's words literally translated are, he is \"worthy of\r\nCrassus,\" if we take Axius as a Greek word. They can also mean, he is\r\n\"Axius son of Crassus.\" The wit lay in associating the name of Axius and\r\nCrassus; but the joke is only made duller by the explanation.\r\n\r\nA Roman Senator named Axius is mentioned by Cicero (_Ad Attic._ iii. 15,\r\nand elsewhere).\r\n\r\n[207] See the Life of Crassus, c. 16.\r\n\r\n[208] L. Gellius Publicola was consul with Cn. Cornelius Lentulus, B.C.\r\n72.\r\n\r\n[209] It is uncertain who this man was. The allusion to the hole in his\r\near signifies that his ears were bored to carry pendants or earrings\r\nafter the fashion of some nations at that time. Cicero meant to imply\r\nthat he was not of genuine Italian stock. Juvenal alludes to a man's\r\nforeign origin being shown by his ears being bored, in the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n                       \"----quamvis\r\n   Natus ad Euphratem, molles quod in aure fenestræ\r\n   Arguerint, licet ipse neges.\"\r\n\r\n_Sat._ i. 103, and the note of Heinrichs.\r\n\r\n[210] Publius Sextius or Sestius was the name of a tribunus plebis who\r\nexerted himself to accomplish the recall of Cicero. There is extant an\r\noration of Cicero entitled Pro P. Sestio, in defence of Publius, who was\r\ntried in the year after Cicero's return on a charge of raising a tumult\r\n(de vi) at the popular meeting in which Cicero's recall was proposed.\r\nCicero speaks of the acquittal of Publius in a letter to his brother\r\nQuintus (ii. 4).\r\n\r\n[211] This obscure man's name is also incorrectly written.\r\n\r\n[212] See the Life of Cato, c. 29.\r\n\r\n[213] Kaltwasser conjectures that the name should be Manius Aquilius,\r\nwho acted as Proconsul in the Servile war in Sicily B.C. 100. In B.C. 88\r\nhe conducted the war against Mithridates in Asia. He fell into the hands\r\nof Mithridates, who put him to death.\r\n\r\nBut this cannot be the person meant by Plutarch, who evidently means a\r\nperson who may be called a contemporary of Cicero. A certain M. Aquinius\r\nis mentioned in the Book on the African War (_De Bell. Afric._ 57).\r\n\r\n[214] Adrastus, king of Argos, gave his two daughters in marriage to\r\nTydeus and Polynices, both of whom were exiles from their native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[215] L. Aurelius Cotta was consul B.C. 65, and censor B.C. 64, the year\r\nin which Cicero was elected consul. In his prætorship, B.C. 70, he\r\nproposed the Lex Aurelia, which determined that the judices for public\r\ntrials should be chosen from the Senators, Equites and Tribuni Ærarii.\r\nNotwithstanding this joke, Cotta was a friend of Cicero, and Cicero\r\noften speaks in high terms of praise of him.\r\n\r\n[216] It is uncertain who this Voconius was. The verse, which is\r\napparently from some Greek tragedian, is conjectured to allude to Laius,\r\nwho begat OEdipus contrary to the advice of the oracle of Apollo.\r\n\r\n[217] Cicero means that he had acted as a public crier (præco). Such\r\npersons were often of servile descent.\r\n\r\n[218] See the life of Sulla, c. 34. The Roman word \"Proscriptio\" means\r\nputting up a public notice, as a sale and the like. The term was also\r\napplied to the public notices, now commonly called proscriptions, by\r\nwhich Sulla and the Triumviri declared the heads of their enemies and\r\ntheir property to be forfeited. (See the Life of Sulla, c. 81, and the\r\nnotes.) This saying of Cicero had both truth and point.\r\n\r\n[219] This story of the intrigue of Clodius is told in the Life of\r\nCæsar, c. 9.\r\n\r\n[220] There is something wanting in the Greek text; but the meaning is\r\nnot obscure. See the note of Sintenis.\r\n\r\n[221] Of course on the day on which Clodius pretended that he was not at\r\nRome. Kaltwasser has inserted the words \"on that day;\" but they are not\r\nin the original.\r\n\r\n[222] So it is in the MSS., though it should probably be Tertia. A\r\nconfusion may easily have arisen between the name Terentia, which has\r\nalready been mentioned in this chapter, and the name Tertia (third),\r\nthough the wife of Q. Marcius Rex is said to have been the oldest of the\r\nthree sisters. Quadranteria is a misprint for Quadrantaria. This lady\r\nwas the wife of Q. Metellus Celer, and was suspected of poisoning him.\r\nCicero vents unbounded abuse upon her; and he also preserved the name\r\nQuadrantaria (_Or. Pro Cælio_, c. 26). The Roman word Quadrans, a\r\nfourth, signified a fourth part of a Roman as, and was a small copper\r\ncoin. The way in which one of her lovers is reported to have paid her in\r\ncopper coin seems to have circulated in Rome as a good practical joke.\r\n\r\n[223] See the Life of Cæsar, c. 10, and the notes.\r\n\r\n[224] The number twenty-five agrees with the common text in Cicero's\r\nLetter to Atticus (i. 16): the other number in the common text of Cicero\r\nis thirty-one. See the note in the Variorum edition.\r\n\r\n[225] Clodius was tribunus plebis in B.C. 58. The consuls of the year\r\nwere L. Calpurnius Piso, the father of Calpurnia, Cæsar's wife, and\r\nAulus Gabinius, a tool of Pompeius.\r\n\r\n[226] Dion Cassius (38, c. 15) says that Cæsar proposed to Cicero to go\r\nto Gaul with him; and Cicero, in a letter to Atticus (i. 19), speaks of\r\nCæsar's proposal to him to go as his legatus. It is difficult to imagine\r\nthat Cæsar made such a proposal, or at least that he seriously intended\r\nto take Cicero with him. He would have been merely an incumbrance.\r\n\r\n[227] Read \"as in a public calamity.\" Cicero speaks of this affair in\r\nhis oration for Cn. Plancius, c. 35; in the latter part of which oration\r\nhe speaks at some length of the circumstances that attended his going\r\ninto exile.\r\n\r\n[228] This was C. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, the first husband of Tullia.\r\nShe was his wife at least as early as B.C. 63, and she was his widow\r\nbefore the end of B.C. 57.\r\n\r\n[229] Cicero, in the oration which he subsequently spoke against this\r\nPiso, gives (c. 6) a strange account of his reception by Piso.\r\n\r\nCato and Hortensius advised Cicero to go (Dion Cassius, 38, c. 17).\r\n\r\n[230] Compare Cicero _De Legibus_, ii. 17, ed. Bakius; and _Ad Attic._\r\nvii. 3. Cicero left Rome in the month of March, B.C. 58.\r\n\r\n[231] Cicero, in a letter to Atticus (iii. 4) says that he was required\r\nto move four hundred Roman miles from the city. Compare Dion Cassius,\r\n38, c. 17.\r\n\r\n[232] Cicero received the news of his sentence when he was near Vibo, a\r\ntown in the country of the Brutii, now Bivona, on the gulf of Sta.\r\nEufemia. He had written to Atticus (iii. 3) to meet him at Vibo, but his\r\nnext letter informed Atticus that he had set out to Brundusium. Cicero\r\nnames the person, Sica, who had shown him hospitality near Vibo.\r\nPlutarch calls him [Greek: Ouibios Sikelos anêr], as if he had mistaken\r\nthe name Sica.\r\n\r\n[233] Cicero mentions this circumstance in his oration for Cn. Plancius,\r\nc. 40 (ed. Wunder, and the Notes). He was well received by the municipia\r\nwhich lay between Vibo and Brundusium. He did not enter the city of\r\nBrundusium, but lodged in the gardens of M. Lænus Flaccus.\r\n\r\n[234] Cicero did not remain at Dyrrachium. His movements are described\r\nin his own letters, and in his oration for Cn. Plancius. He went to\r\nThessalonica in Macedonia, where Plancius then was in the capacity of\r\nquæstor to L. Apuleius, Prætor of Macedonia. He reached Thessalonica on\r\nthe 23rd of May (x. Kal. Jun.), and there is a letter extant addressed\r\nto Atticus (ii. 8), which is dated from Thessalonica on the 29th of May\r\n(Dat. iiii. Kal. Jun. Thessalonicæ).\r\n\r\n[235] His unmanly lamentations are recorded in his own letters and in\r\nhis own speech for Cn. Plancius, c. 42.\r\n\r\n[236] Cicero was not a practical philosopher. Like most persons who have\r\nbeen much engaged in public life, he lived in the opinion of others. He\r\ndid not follow the maxim of the Emperor Antoninus, who bids us \"Look\r\nwithin; for within is the source of good, and it sends up a continuous\r\nstream to those who will always dig there\" (vii. 59). Cicero did not\r\nreverence his own soul, but he placed his happiness \"in the opinion of\r\nothers\" (i. 6). Perhaps however he was not weaker than most active\r\npoliticians, whose letters would be as dolorous and lachrymose as his,\r\nif they were banished to a distant colony.\r\n\r\n[237] This is not obscure, if it is properly considered, and it contains\r\na serious truth. A man must view things as they are, and he must not\r\ntake his notions of them from the affects of the many. \"Things touch not\r\nthe soul, but they are out of it, and passive; perturbations come only\r\nfrom the opinion that is within a man\" (M. Antoninus, iv. 3).\r\n\r\nThe philosophic emperor and the unphilosophic statesman were very\r\ndifferent persons. The emperor both preached and practised. The\r\nstatesman showed his feebleness by his arrogance in prosperity and his\r\nabjectness in adversity.\r\n\r\n[238] These proceedings are described by Cicero in his oration (_Pro\r\nDomo_, c. 24). The marble columns were removed from his house on the\r\nPalatine to the premises of the father-in-law of the consul Piso, in the\r\npresence of the people. Gabinius, the other consul, who was Cicero's\r\nneighbour at Tusculum, removed to his own land the stock that was on\r\nCicero's estate and the ornaments of the house, and even the trees.\r\n\r\n[239] In B.C. 57, P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther and Q. Cæcilius\r\nMetellus Nepos were consuls. Cicero alludes to the disturbance which\r\npreceded his recall in his oration for P. Sextius, c. 35: \"Caedem in\r\nforo maximam faciunt, universique destrictis gladiis et cruentis in\r\nomnibus fori partibus fratrem meum, virum optimum, fortissimum, meique\r\namantissimum oculis quaerebant, voce poscebant.\" Cicero adds that his\r\nbrother being driven from the Rostra lay down in the Comitium, and\r\nprotected himself \"with the bodies of slaves and freedmen;\" by which\r\nCicero seems to mean that his slaves and freedmen kept watch over him\r\ntill he made his escape at night. Plutarch appears to have misunderstood\r\nthe passage or to have had some other authority. In this dreadful tumult\r\n\"the Tiber was filled with the dead bodies of the citizens, the drains\r\nwere choaked, and the blood was wiped up from the Forum with sponges.\"\r\nThis looks somewhat like rhetorical embellishment.\r\n\r\n[240] Cicero in a letter to Atticus (iv. 2) gives an account of the\r\ncompensation which he received. The valuation of his house at Rome\r\n(superficies aedium) was fixed at HS. vicies, or two million sesterces.\r\nHe seems not to have objected to this, but he complains of the valuation\r\nof his Tusculanum and Formianum.\r\n\r\n[241] In the seventeenth month according to Clinton (_Fasti Hellen._\r\nB.C. 57). The passage that Plutarch refers to is in the Oration to the\r\nSenate after his return (c. 15): \"Cum me vestra auctoritas arcessierit,\r\nPopulus Romanus revocarit, Respublica implorarit, Italia cuncta paene\r\nsuis humeris reportarit.\"\r\n\r\n[242] See the Life of Cato, c. 40, and Dion Cassius, 39, c. 21.\r\n\r\n[243] Clodius was killed B.C. 52, the year in which Pompeius was chosen\r\nsole consul. Cicero's speech for Milo is extant, or at least a speech\r\nwhich he wrote after the trial. Milo was condemned and went an exile to\r\nMassilia. His property was sold and it went cheap. Cicero was under some\r\nsuspicion of being a purchaser; but the matter is quite unintelligible\r\n(Drumann, _Annii_, p. 49, and the references). There could be no reason\r\nwhy Cicero should write in such obscure terms to Atticus, if his conduct\r\nin this matter was fair.\r\n\r\n[244] Crassus perished B.C. 54. See the Life of Crassus.\r\n\r\n[245] His province also comprehended Pisidia, Pamphylia, and Cyprus. The\r\nproconsulship of Cicero was in B.C. 51, though he had been consul in\r\nB.C. 63. Cicero went to Cilicia against his will (_Ad Diversos_, iii.\r\n2). Pompeius had got the Senate (B.C. 52) to pass an order that no\r\nperson should hold a province within five years after being consul or\r\nprætor. This was aimed at Cæsar, if he should get a second consulship.\r\nPompeius also wished to have Cicero out of the way, and the provinces\r\nwere to be supplied with governors from among those who did not come\r\nwithin the terms of the new rule: and Cicero was one of them (Cicero,\r\n_Ad Diversos_, iii. 2; _Ad Attic._ vi. 6).\r\n\r\n[246] He was the third Cappadocian king of this name. This unlucky king\r\nwas a debtor of Cn. Pompeius and M. Junius Brutus, the most\r\ndistinguished Roman money-lender of his day (Cicero, _Ad Attic._ vi.\r\n1-3). Both Pompeius and Brutus were pressing the king for money.\r\nDeiotarus also sent to Ariobarzanes to try to get some money out of him\r\nfor Brutus. The king's answer was that he had none, and Cicero says that\r\nhe believed he told the truth, for that no country was in a more\r\nimpoverished state and nobody more beggared than the king. Cicero dunned\r\nthe king continually with letters, but he was not particularly well\r\npleased with his commission (_Ad Attic._ vi. 2). The end was that the\r\nking provided for the payment of about one hundred talents to Brutus\r\nduring Cicero's year of government. He had promised Pompeius two hundred\r\nin six months, which, as a judicious commentator remarks, is not worth\r\nso much as a security for one hundred. These money doings of the\r\nsupposed patriot Brutus should be well examined by those who still\r\nretain an opinion of the virtues of this Republican hero.\r\n\r\n[247] There seems no reason to doubt that Cicero's administration of his\r\nprovince was just and mild. Plutarch has apparently derived some of the\r\nfacts here mentioned from Cicero himself (_Ad Attic._ vi. 2): \"Aditus\r\nautem ad me minime provinciales; nihil per cubicularium: ante lucem\r\ninambulabam domi, ut olim candidatus.\"\r\n\r\n[248] Cicero's exploits were such as would not have been recorded, if he\r\nhad not been his own historian. In a letter to Cato (_Ad Diversos_, xv.\r\n4), he gives a pretty full account of his operations; and he asks Cato\r\nto use his influence to get him the honour of a Supplicatio or Public\r\nThanksgiving. Cato's short reply, which he says is longer than his\r\nletters usually are, is a model in its way.\r\n\r\n[249] So it is in Plutarch's text: it may be the blunder of Plutarch, or\r\nthe blunder of his copyists. The true name is M. Cælius (Cic. _Ad\r\nDiversos_, ii. 11), who was curule ædile B.C. 51. The saying about the\r\npanthers is in this letter of Cicero, who had set the panther-hunters to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nCicero returned to Rome in B.C. 50. He mentions (_Ad Attic._ vi. 7) his\r\nintention to call at Rhodes.\r\n\r\n[250] The events of this chapter, which belong to B.C. 49, are told at\r\nlength in the Lives of Pompeius and Cæsar. Cicero's irresolution is well\r\nmarked in his own letters; in one of which (_Ad Attic._ viii. 7,\r\nreferred to by Kaltwasser) he says:--\"Ego quem fugiam habeo, quem sequar\r\nnon habeo.\"\r\n\r\nThere are no letters extant of Trebatius to the purport which Plutarch\r\nstates, but Cæsar wrote to Cicero and begged him to stay at Rome. Cicero\r\n(_Ad Attic._ ix. 16) has given a copy of Cæsar's letter; and a copy of\r\nanother letter from Cæsar (_Ad Attic._ x. 8), in which he urges Cicero\r\nto keep quiet. There seems to be no doubt that Trebatius had been\r\nemployed by Cæsar to write to Cicero and speak to him about remaining\r\nneutral at least. Cicero had an interview with Cæsar at Formiæ, after\r\nCæsar's return from Brundusium (_Ad Atticum_, ix. 18, 19; _Ad Diversos_,\r\niv. 1). The letter last referred to is addressed to Servius Sulpicius.\r\n\r\n[251] L. Domitius Ahenobarbus. See the Life of Cæsar, c. 34.\r\n\r\n[252] See the Life of Pompeius, c. 37, notes.\r\n\r\n[253] Smart sayings are not generally improved by explanation, and they\r\nought not to require it. Cicero apparently meant to say that it was as\r\nabsurd to talk of men being dispirited after a victory, as if one were\r\nto say that Cæsar's friends disliked him.\r\n\r\n[254] After defeating Pharnaces Cæsar landed in Italy, in September,\r\nB.C. 47, of the unreformed calendar. Cicero had received a letter from\r\nCæsar before Cæsar's arrival in Italy. The letter was written in Egypt\r\n(Cicero, _Ad Diversos_, xiv. 23; _Pro Q. Ligario_, c. 3). Compare Dion\r\nCassius, 46, c. 12, 22, as to the conduct of Cicero to Cæsar. Before the\r\nend of the year Cicero was in Rome.\r\n\r\n[255] It is difficult to see what was the resemblance between Perikles\r\nand Cicero. Theramenes was somewhat more like him, for he tried to be on\r\nmore sides than one, and met with the usual fate of such people. He was\r\none of the so-called Thirty Tyrants of Athens, and he was sacrificed by\r\nhis colleagues.\r\n\r\n[256] The speech of Cicero is extant. The allusion of Plutarch is\r\nparticularly to the third chapter.\r\n\r\n[257] Cicero in a letter to L. Papirius Pætus (_Ad Diversos_, ix. 18)\r\nalludes to his occupations at Tusculum. He compares himself to\r\nDionysius, who after being driven from Syracuse is said to have opened a\r\nschool at Corinth. Cicero's literary activity after B.C. 47 is the most\r\nremarkable passage in his life. He required to be doing something.\r\n\r\n[258] The allusion is to the story of Laertes in the Odyssey, i. 190,\r\nand xxiv. 226.\r\n\r\n[259] She was divorced some time in B.C. 46. The latest extant letter to\r\nTerentia is dated on the first of October, B.C. 47, from Venusia. Cicero\r\nwas then on his road from Brundusium to Tusculanum. He orders his wife\r\nto have everything ready for him; some friends would probably be with\r\nhim, and they might stay some time. The bath was to be got ready, and\r\neatables, and everything else. A gentleman would write a more civil\r\nletter to his housekeeper.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Cn. Plancius (_Ad Diversos_, ix. 14), who congratulates\r\nCicero on his new marriage, he says that nothing would have induced him\r\nto take such a step at such a time, if he had not found on his return\r\nhis domestic affairs even worse than public affairs. According to his\r\nown account he was hardly safe in his own house, and it was necessary to\r\nstrengthen himself by new alliances against the perfidy of old ones.\r\nTerentia may have been a bad housekeeper, and her temper was not the\r\nsweetest. She could not have any feeling for her husband except\r\ncontempt, and he repaid it by getting rid of her. Cicero had to repay\r\nthe Dos of Terentia, but she never got it back, so far as we can learn.\r\n\r\nIt is not known what was the age of Terentia when she was divorced, but\r\nshe could not be young. Yet there are stories of her marrying\r\nSallustius, the historian, and after him Messala Corvinus, but the\r\nauthority for these marriages is weak. She is said to have attained the\r\nage of one hundred and three. Terentia had a large property of her own.\r\nThere is no imputation on her character, which, for those times, is much\r\nin her favour. She had courage in danger and firmness of purpose, both\r\nof which her husband wanted. \"Her husband,\" says Drumann, \"who always\r\nlooked for and needed some support, must often have acted under her\r\ninfluence: for him it was a fortunate thing to have such a woman by his\r\nside, and a scandal that he put her away.\"\r\n\r\n[260] Her name was Publilia. Cicero was now sixty years of age. Various\r\nladies had been recommended to Cicero. He would not marry the daughter\r\nof Pompeius Magnus, the widow of Faustus Sulla, perhaps for fear that it\r\nmight displease Cæsar; another who was recommended to him was too ugly\r\n(_Ad Attic._ xiv. 11). Publilia was young and rich: her father had left\r\nher a large fortune, but in order to evade the Lex Voconia, which\r\nlimited the amount that a woman could take by testament, the property\r\nwas given to Cicero in trust to give it to her. The marriage turned out\r\nunhappy. In a letter to Atticus (xiv. 32), written when Cicero was alone\r\nin the country, he says that Publilia had written to pray that she might\r\ncome to him with her mother; but he had told her that he preferred being\r\nalone, and he begs Atticus to let him know how long he could safely stay\r\nin the country without a visit from his young wife. Tullia died in B.C.\r\n45, and Cicero had now no relief except in his studies; his new wife was\r\na burden to him, and he divorced her. He had the Dos of Publilia now to\r\nrepay, and Terentia was not settled with; thus, in addition to his other\r\ntroubles, he was troubled about money (_Ad Attic._, xiv. 34, 47).\r\n\r\nDion Cassius (57. 15) says that Vibius Rufus, who was consul A.D. 22, in\r\nthe time of Tiberius, married Cicero's widow, and Middleton supposes\r\nthat Terentia is meant, but this is very unlikely; Dion must mean\r\nPublilia.\r\n\r\n[261] Tiro was a freedman of Cicero, and had been brought up in his\r\nhouse. He had a good capacity and his master was strongly attached to\r\nhim. Cicero's letters to him are in the sixteenth book of the\r\nMiscellaneous Collection. It is said that Tiro collected the letters of\r\nCicero after Cicero's death, by doing which he has rendered a great\r\nservice to history, and little to his master.\r\n\r\n[262] Tullia's first husband was C. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who died\r\nprobably early in B.C. 57. In B.C. 56 Tullia married Furius Crassipes,\r\nfrom whom she was divorced, but the circumstances are not known. Her\r\nthird husband was P. Cornelius Dolabella, a patrician. It seems that she\r\nwas separated from Dolabella before she died. Tullia did not die in\r\nRome, but at her father's house at Tusculum, in February, B.C. 45.\r\nTullia left one son by Dolabella, who was named Lentulus. His father,\r\nDolabella, is also named Lentulus, whence it is concluded that he had\r\nbeen adopted by a Lentulus. The Lentuli were Cornelii.\r\n\r\n[263] Cæsar was murdered on the Ides of March, B.C. 44. The\r\ncircumstances of Cæsar's death, and the events which follow, are told in\r\nthe Lives of Cæsar and Antonius. Cicero saw Cæsar fall (_Ad Attic._ xiv.\r\n14), and he rejoiced.\r\n\r\n[264] An \"oblivion\" or \"non-remembrance\" is a declaration of those who\r\nhave the sovereign power in a state, that certain persons shall be\r\nexcused for their political acts. It implies that those who grant the\r\namnesty have the power, and that those to whom it is granted are in\r\nsubjection to them, or have not the political power which the authors of\r\nthe amnesty assume. After Thrasybulus at Athens had overthrown the\r\nThirty Tyrants as they are called, an amnesty was declared, but the\r\nThirty and some few others were excluded from it (Xenophon, _Hellen._\r\nii. 4, 38).\r\n\r\nCicero in his first Philippic (c. 1) alludes to his attempt to bring\r\nabout a settlement. The senate met on the eighteenth of March in the\r\ntemple of Tellus: \"In quo templo quantum in me fuit jeci fundamenta\r\npacis, Atheniensiumque renovavi vetus exemplum: Græcum etiam verbum\r\nusurpavi quo tum in sedandis discordiis erat usa civitas illa, atque\r\nomnem memoriam discordiarum oblivione sempiterna delendam censui.\"\r\n\r\n[265] P. Cornelius Dolabella, once the husband of Tullia, Cicero's\r\ndaughter. He was consul, after Cæsar's death, with M. Antonius, and in\r\nthe next year, B.C. 43, he was in Syria as governor. Cassius, who was\r\nalso in Syria, attacked Dolabella and took Laodicea, where Dolabella\r\nwas. To avoid falling into the hands of his enemy, Dolabella ordered a\r\nsoldier to kill him.\r\n\r\n[266] A. Hirtius, or as Plutarch writes the name Irtius, and C. Vibius\r\nPansa were the consuls of B.C. 53. Cicero set out from Rome soon after\r\nCæsar's death with the intention of going to Greece (_Ad Attic._ xiv.).\r\nHe went as far as Syracuse, whence he returned to Rome, which he reached\r\non the last day of August (_Ad Diversos_, xii. 25; _Ad Attic._ xvi. 7;\r\n_Philipp._ i. 5; v. 7). Cicero in the passage last referred to speaks of\r\nthe violent measures of Antonius; \"huc etiam nisi venirem Kal. Sept.\r\nfabros se missurum et domum meam disturbaturum esse dixit.\" On the\r\nsecond of September he delivered his first Philippic in the Senate. It\r\nis an evidence of Cicero's great mental activity that he wrote his\r\nTopica, addressed to Trebatius, on shipboard after he had set sail from\r\nVelia with the intention of going to Greece. He says that he had no\r\nbooks with him (_Topica_, c. 1, &c.).\r\n\r\n[267] C. Octavius, the grandson of Cæsar's younger sister Julia, and the\r\nson of C. Octavius, prætor B.C. 61, by Atia, the daughter of M. Atius\r\nBalbus and Julia. C. Octavius, the young Cæsar, was born B.C. 63, in the\r\nconsulship of Cicero. The dictator by his testament left him a large\r\nproperty and his name. Accordingly he is henceforth called C. Julius\r\nCæsar Octavianus, but he is better known as the future Emperor Augustus.\r\nAt the time of the Dictator's assassination he was at Apollonia, a town\r\non the coast of Illyricum. He came to Rome on the news of Cæsar's death\r\nwith his friend M. Vipsanius Agrippa. Cicero saw him at his Cuman villa\r\non his way to Rome (_Ad. Attic._ xiv. 11, 12).\r\n\r\n[268] Plutarch probably means Greek drachmæ, for he states the sum in\r\nhis Life of Antonius, c. 15, in round numbers at 4000 talents. The\r\nSepties Millies which Cicero speaks of (_Philipp._ ii. 37) is a\r\ndifferent sum of money.\r\n\r\n[269] Cæsar's mother had taken for her second husband L. Marcius\r\nPhilippus. She just lived to see her youthful son consul in B.C. 43.\r\n\r\nOctavia, the younger sister of Cæsar, was now the wife of C. Marcellus,\r\nwho had been consul B.C. 50. After the death of Marcellus, she married\r\nM. Antonius (B.C. 40), being then with child by her deceased husband.\r\nThe Roman law did not allow a woman to marry till ten months after her\r\nhusband's death; the object of the rule was to prevent the paternity of\r\na child from being doubtful. Plutarch correctly states the time at ten\r\nmonths (Life of Antonius, c. 31). If Octavia was then with child, as\r\nDion Cassius says (48. c. 3), the reason for the rule did not exist. In\r\nlater times, at least, the rule was dispensed with when the reason for\r\nit ceased, as when a pregnant widow was delivered of a child before the\r\nend of the ten months. Ten months was the assumed time of complete\r\ngestation (Savigny, _System_, &c. ii. 181).\r\n\r\n[270] Young Cæsar had raised troops in Campania, and chiefly at Capua\r\namong the veteran soldiers of the dictator, who had been settled on\r\nlands there (Dion Cassius, 45. c. 12; Cicero, _Ad Atticum_, xvi. 8). He\r\ngave the men five hundred denarii apiece, about eighteen pounds\r\nsterling, by way of bounty, and led them to Rome. These men were old\r\nsoldiers, well trained to their work. The youth who did this was\r\nnineteen years of age, a boy, as Cicero calls him; but a boy who\r\noutwitted him and everybody else, and maintained for more than half a\r\ncentury the power which he now seized.\r\n\r\n[271] Dreams were viewed in a sort as manifestations of the will of the\r\ngods. This dream happened, as Dion Cassius tells (45. c. 2), to Catulus;\r\nand he makes Cicero dream another dream. Cicero dreamed that Octavius\r\nwas let down from heaven by a chain of gold, and was presented with a\r\nwhip by Jupiter. Suetonius (_Octav. Cæsar_, c. 94) agrees with Dion\r\nCassius. The whip was significant. Jupiter meant that somebody required\r\nwhipping, and he put the whip in the hands of a youth who knew how to\r\nuse it.\r\n\r\n[272] The young man cajoled the old one and made a tool of him. Like all\r\nvain men, Cicero was ready to be used by those who knew how to handle\r\nhim. There is a letter from Brutus to Cicero (_Ad Brutum_, 16), and one\r\nof Brutus to Atticus (_Ad Brutum_, 17), to the purport here stated by\r\nPlutarch. But these letters may be spurious.\r\n\r\n[273] He was at Athens in B.C. 44, when Cicero addressed to him his\r\nOfficia. He had been a year there (_De Offic._ i. 1) at the time when\r\nthe first chapter was written. The poet Horatius was there at the same\r\ntime. When M. Brutus came to Athens in the autumn of B.C. 44, Cicero\r\njoined Brutus, who gave him a command in his cavalry (Plutarch,\r\n_Brutus_, c. 24, 26).\r\n\r\n[274] The consuls were sent to relieve Mutina (Modena), in which Decimus\r\nBrutus, the governor of Cisalpine Gaul, was besieged by Antonius. Cicero\r\nhad recommended the Senate to give Cæsar the authority of a commander.\r\nCæsar received a command with the insignia of a prætor. There were two\r\nbattles at Mutina, in April, B.C. 43, in which the two consuls fell.\r\n\r\n[275] It is stated by various authorities that Cicero was cajoled with\r\nthe hopes of the consulship (Dion Cassius, 46. c. 42; Appian, _Civil\r\nWars_, iii. 82). The testimony of the tenth letter to Brutus (Cicero _Ad\r\nBrutum_, 10) is not decisive against other evidence. Cæsar came to Rome\r\nin August, B.C. 43, with his army, and through the alarm which he\r\ncreated, was elected consul with Q. Pedius (Dion Cassius, 16. c. 43,\r\n&c.; Appian, _Civil Wars_, iii. 94).\r\n\r\n[276] After he was elected consul, Cæsar left the city for North Italy,\r\nand was joined by Antonius and Lepidus (Appian, _Civil War_, iii. 96,\r\n&c.). M. Æmilius Lepidus, son of M. Lepidus, consul B.C. 78, was consul\r\nin B.C. 46, with C. Julius Cæsar. He was elected Pontifex Maximus after\r\nCæsar's death: he had been declared an enemy of the State by the Senate,\r\nbut Cæsar had compelled the Senate to annul their declaration against\r\nAntonius and Lepidus, as a preparatory step to the union with them which\r\nhe meditated. Lepidus is painted to the life by Shakespeare (_Julius\r\nCæsar_, iv. 2):\r\n\r\n   \"_Ant._ This is a slight unmeritable man,\r\n    Meet to be sent on errands.\"\r\n\r\n[277] Now Bologna. They met in a small island of the Rhenus, or\r\nLavinius, as the name is in Appian (_Civil Wars_, iv. 2). The meeting is\r\nalso described by Dion Cassius (46. c. 45), and here they formed a\r\ntriumvirate for five years. The number of the proscribed, according to\r\nAppian, was three hundred senators and two thousand equites. The power\r\nof the triumvirate was confirmed at Rome in legal form (Appian, _Civil\r\nWars_, iv. 7).\r\n\r\n[278] L. Æmilius Paulus, consul B.C. 50, who is said to have sold\r\nhimself to the Dictator Cæsar (_Life of Cæsar_, c. 29). As to his name\r\nPaulus, see Drumann (_Æmilii_). Paulus was allowed to escape to M.\r\nBrutus, by the favour of some soldiers. He was as insignificant as his\r\nbrother the Triumvir. L. Cæsar, consul B.C. 64, was the brother of\r\nJulia, the mother of M. Antonius. Julia saved her brother's life. Lucius\r\nwas a man of no mark.\r\n\r\n[279] The circumstances of Cicero's death are told more minutely by\r\nPlutarch than by any other writer. He left the city before the arrival\r\nof the Triumviri in November, and apparently when the bloody work of the\r\nproscription had commenced. He had probably heard of his fate before he\r\nreached Tusculum.\r\n\r\n[280] Astura was a small place on the coast of Latium, a little south of\r\nAntium. Near Astura a small stream, Fiume Astura, flows into the sea.\r\nCicero had a villa here. The country at the back was a forest.\r\n(Westphal, _Die Römische Kampagne_, and his maps.)\r\n\r\n[281] Appian (_Civil Wars_, iv. 20) says that the father told his\r\nmurderers to kill him first, his son did the same, on which they were\r\nparted and murdered at the same time. Dion Cassius (47, c. 10) gives a\r\ndifferent story. The main fact that they were murdered is not doubtful,\r\nbut, as is usual, the circumstances are uncertain.\r\n\r\n[282] Or Circeii, now Monte Circello, that remarkable mountain\r\npromontory which is the only striking feature on the coast of Latium.\r\nThe agony of Cicero's mind is powerfully depicted in his irresolution.\r\nThe times were such as to make even a brave man timid, but a true\r\nphilosopher would have shown more resolution. His turning his steps\r\ntowards Rome and his return are not improbable. He had been doing the\r\nsame kind of thing all his life.\r\n\r\n[283] So in the text of Plutarch, but Caieta (Gaeta) is meant. Cicero\r\nhad a villa at Formiæ, near Caieta, his Formianum, which he often\r\nmentions and which in his prosperous days was a favourite retreat.\r\n\r\nThe Appian road passed from Terracina through Fundi (Fondi) and Itri,\r\nwhence there is a view of Gaeta. The next place is Formiæ, Mola di\r\nGaeta, on the beautiful bay of Gaeta. There are numerous remains about\r\nthe site of Formiæ, which of course are taken for Cicero's villa. The\r\nsite was doubtless near the Mola and the village Castiglione. The\r\nFormian villa was destroyed when Cicero was banished, but he received\r\nsome compensation, and he rebuilt it.\r\n\r\n[284] This Popilius was C. Popilius Lænas, a military tribune, whom\r\nCicero at the request of M. Cælius had once defended (Dion Cassius, 47.\r\nc. 11).\r\n\r\n[285] Plutarch's narrative leads us to suppose that Cicero saw that his\r\ntime was come and offered his neck to the murderers. Appian's narrative\r\n(_Civil Wars_, iv. 20) is that Lænas drew Cicero's head out of the\r\nlitter and struck three blows before he severed it. He was so awkward at\r\nthe work that the operation was like sawing the neck off.\r\n\r\nCicero was murdered on the 7th of December, B.C. 73, being nearly\r\nsixty-four years of age.\r\n\r\n[286] The same story is told by Appian, except that he mentions only the\r\nright hand. The murderer received for his pains a large sum of money,\r\nmuch more than was promised. It is hardly credible that Antonius placed\r\nthe head of Cicero on a tablet at a banquet (Appian, _Civil Wars_, iv.\r\n20). Though he hated Cicero and with good reason, such a brutal act is\r\nnot credible of him, nor is it consistent with the story of the head\r\nbeing fixed on the Rostra; not to mention other reasons against the\r\nstory that might be urged. Dion Cassius (47. c. 8) says that Fulvia, the\r\nwife of Antonius, pierced the tongue of Cicero with one of the pins\r\nwhich women wore in their hair, and added other insults. To make his\r\nstory probable, he says that it was done before the head was fixed on\r\nthe Rostra.\r\n\r\n[287] His name was Philogonus. The story about Philogonus is refuted by\r\nthe silence of Tiro.\r\n\r\nPomponia, the wife of Quintus, was the sister of T. Pomponius Atticus,\r\nthe friend of Cicero. She and her husband did not live in harmony.\r\n\r\n[288] These were Caius and Lucius, the sons of Cæsar's daughter Julia by\r\nM. Vipsanius Agrippa.\r\n\r\n[289] Cæsar defeated Antonius at the battle of Actium, B.C. 31. Cicero's\r\nson Marcus was made an augur, and he was consul with Cæsar in B.C. 30.\r\nHe was afterwards proconsul of Asia. The time of his death is unknown.\r\nCicero's son had neither ambition nor ability. All that is certainly\r\nknown of him is that he loved eating and drinking, for neither of which\r\nhad his father any inclination. There are two letters of the son to Tiro\r\nextant (Cicero, _Ad Diversos_, xvi. 21, 25).\r\n\r\nThe Life of Cicero is only a sketch of Cicero's character, but a better\r\nsketch than any modern writer has made. It does not affect to be a\r\nhistory of the times, nor does it affect to estimate with any exactness\r\nhis literary merit. But there is not a single great defect in his moral\r\ncharacter that is not touched, nor a virtue that has not been\r\nsignalized. Those who would do justice to him and have not time to\r\nexamine for themselves, may trust Plutarch at least as safely as any\r\nmodern writer.\r\n\r\nIf in these notes I have occasionally expressed an unfavourable opinion\r\ndirectly or indirectly, I have expressed none that I do not believe\r\ntrue, and none for which abundant evidence cannot be produced, even from\r\nCicero's own writings. It is a feeble and contemptible criticism that\r\nwould palliate or excuse that which admits not of excuse. It is a\r\nspurious liberality that would gloss over the vices and faults of men\r\nbecause they have had great virtues, and would impute to those who tell\r\nthe whole truth a malignant pleasure in defaming and vilifying exalted\r\nmerit. This assumed fair dealing and magnanimity would deprive us of the\r\nmost instructive lessons that human life teaches--that all men have their\r\nweaknesses, their failings and their vices, and that no intellectual\r\ngreatness is a security against them. \"It is not absolutely railing\r\nagainst anything to proclaim its defects, because they are in all things\r\nto be found, how beautiful or how much to be coveted soever\"\r\n(Montaigne). The failings of a great man are more instructive than those\r\nof an obscure man. They exhibit the weak points at which any man may be\r\nassailed, and in some of which no man is impregnable. Cicero's writings\r\nhave made us as familiar with him as with the writers of our own\r\ncountry, and there is hardly a European author of modern times who is\r\nmore universally read than Cicero in some or other of his numerous\r\ncompositions. His letters alone, which were never intended for\r\npublication, and were written to a great variety of persons as the\r\nevents of the day prompted, furnish a mass of historical evidence,\r\nwhich, if we consider his position and the times in which he lived, is\r\nnot surpassed by any similar collection. He is thus mixed up with the\r\nevents of the most stirring and interesting period of his country's\r\nhistory; and every person who studies that history must endeavour to\r\nform a just estimate of the character of a man who is both a great actor\r\nin public events and an important witness.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Cicero by Middleton is a partial work: the evidence is\r\nimperfectly examined and the author's prejudices in favour of Cicero\r\nhave given a false colouring to many facts. The most laborious life of\r\nCicero is by Drumann (_Geschichte Roms_, Tullii), in which all the\r\nauthorities are collected. In the 'Penny Cyclopædia' (art. 'Cicero')\r\nthere is a good sketch of Cicero's political career; and in the\r\n'Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology,' edited by Dr.\r\nW. Smith, a very complete account of Cicero's writings, distributed\r\nunder their several heads.\r\n\r\n[290] \"Cedant arma togæ, concedat laurea linguæ.\"\r\n\r\n[291] \"Written,\" because many of them were never spoken.\r\n\r\n[292] Augustus.\r\n\r\n[293] For some account of the evil repute of those who dealt in these\r\ninsurances, see vol. ii., Life of Cato Major, ch. 21.\r\n\r\n[294] Plutarch uses the equivalent Greek word for ædile, but we know\r\nthat Cicero went to Sicily as quæstor.\r\n\r\n[295] Antigonus, surnamed the one-eyed, King of Asia, was the son of\r\nPhilip of Elymiotis. He was one of the generals of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[296] Hor. Carm. ii. 19.\r\n\r\n[297] This was the holy robe of Athena, carried in procession through\r\nAthens at the Panathenaic festival.

Kardia.\r\n\r\n[319] See vol. ii., Life of Pyrrhus, ch. 7.\r\n\r\n[320] See ch. 10.\r\n\r\n[321] Wife of Ptolemy, King of Egypt.\r\n\r\n[322] B.C. 284.\r\n\r\n[323] His death is told in the Life of Marius, c. 44.\r\n\r\n[324] The Antonia Gens contained both Patricians and Plebeians. The\r\ncognomen of the Patrician Antonii was Merenda. M. Antonius Creticus, a\r\nson of Antonius the orator, belonged to the Patricians. In B.C. 74 he\r\ncommanded a fleet in the Mediterranean against the pirates. He attacked\r\nthe Cretans on the ground of their connection with Mithridates; but he\r\nlost a large part of his fleet, and his captured men were hung on the\r\nropes of their own vessels. He died shortly after of shame and vexation.\r\nThe surname Creticus was given him by way of mockery. According to Dion\r\nCassius (xlv. 47) he died deeply in debt. He left three sons, Marcus,\r\nCaius and Lucius. His eldest son Marcus was probably born in B.C. 83.\r\n\r\n[325] See the Life of Cicero, c. 22.\r\n\r\n[326] C. Scribonius Curio, the son of a father of the same name. See the\r\nLife of Cæsar, c. 58. The amount of debt is stated by Cicero (Philipp.\r\nii. 18) at the same sum, \"sestertium sexagies.\"\r\n\r\n[327] He joined Aulus Gabinius at the end of B.C. 58. Gabinius and L.\r\nCalpurnius Piso were consuls in that year.\r\n\r\n[328] He was king and high priest of the Jews. Pompeius had taken him\r\nprisoner and sent him to Rome, whence he contrived to make his escape,\r\nB.C. 57. Gabinius again sent him prisoner to Rome (Dion Cass. xxxvi. 15;\r\nxxxix. 55).\r\n\r\n[329] Ptolemæus Auletes was the father of Cleopatra, and now an exile at\r\nEphesus. His visit to Rome is mentioned in the Life of the younger Cato,\r\nc. 35, and in the Life of Pompeius, c. 49. During his exile his daughter\r\nBerenice reigned, and she was put to death by her father after his\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\n[330] This Greek word literally signifies \"outbreak.\" It was the narrow\r\npassage by which the Serbonian lake was connected with the\r\nMediterranean. This lake lay on the coast and on the line of march from\r\nSyria to Pelusium, the frontier town of Egypt on the east.\r\n\r\n[331] Typhon, a brother of Osiris and Isis, was the evil deity of the\r\nEgyptians, but his influence in the time of Herodotus must have been\r\nsmall, as he was then buried under the Serbonian lake (Herodotus, iii.\r\n5).\r\n\r\n[332] The Greek name is Erythra, which may be translated Red: the Romans\r\ncalled the same sea Rubrum. In Herodotus the Red Sea is called the\r\nArabian Gulf; and the Erythræan sea is the Indian Ocean. See the Life of\r\nPompeius, c. 38.\r\n\r\n[333] He was the son of Archelaus, the general of Mithridates. See the\r\nLife of Sulla, c. 23. He had become the husband of Berenice and shared\r\nthe regal power with her. Probably Antonius had known Archelaus in his\r\nyouth, for Archelaus the father went over from Mithridates to the\r\nRomans. Dion Cassius (xxxiv. 58) says that Gabinius put Archelaus to\r\ndeath after the capture of Alexandria. This Egyptian campaign belongs to\r\nB.C. 55.\r\n\r\n[334] This characteristic appears on the coins of Antonius.\r\n\r\n[335] Decies is literally \"Ten times.\" The phrase is \"Decies\r\nsestertium,\" which is a short way of expressing \"ten times a hundred\r\nthousand sesterces.\" When Plutarch says \"five-and-twenty thousand,\" he\r\nmeans drachmæ, as observed in previous notes, and he considers drachmæ\r\nas equivalent to Roman Denarii. Now a Denarius is four sesterces, and\r\n25,000 Denarii = 1,000,000 sesterces, Kaltwasser suggests that in the\r\nGreek text \"sestertium\" has been accidentally omitted after \"decies;\"\r\nbut \"decies\" is the reading of all the MSS., and it is sufficient.\r\n\r\n[336] Antonius, after returning from Egypt in B.C. 54, went to Cæsar in\r\nGaul, who was then in winter-quarters after his return from the second\r\nBritish expedition. In B.C. 53 Antonius was again at Rome, and in B.C.\r\n52 he was a Quæstor, and returned to Cæsar in Gaul. In B.C. 50 he was\r\nagain in Rome, in which year he was made Augur, and was elected Tribunus\r\nPlebis for the following year.\r\n\r\nCompare with this chapter the Life of Pompeius, c. 58, and the Life of\r\nCæsar, c. 31.\r\n\r\n[337] Quintus Cassius Longinus is called by Cicero a brother of C.\r\nCassius; but Drumann conjectures that he may have been a cousin. After\r\nthe defeat of Afranius and Petreius by Cæsar B.C. 49, he was made\r\nProprætor of Spain.\r\n\r\n[338] This expression of Cicero occurs in his Second Philippic, c. 22:\r\n\"ut Helena Trojanis, sic iste huic reipublicæ causa belli, causa pestis\r\natque exitii fuit.\" Plutarch's remark on Cicero's extravagant expression\r\nis just.\r\n\r\nAs to the events mentioned in this chapter, compare the Life of Cæsar,\r\nc. 34, &c.\r\n\r\n[339] Cæsar returned from Iberia (Spain) before the end of B.C. 49.\r\nEarly in B.C. 48 he crossed over from Brundusium to the Illyrian coast,\r\nwhere he was joined by Antonius and Fufius Calenus.\r\n\r\n[340] Gabinius took his troops by land, and consequently had to march\r\nnorthwards along the Adriatic and round the northern point of it to\r\nreach Illyricum. From Plutarch's narrative it would appear that he set\r\nout about the same time as Antonius. Drumann (_Cornificii_, 3) states\r\nthat the time of his leaving Italy is incorrectly stated by Plutarch,\r\nAppian, and Dion Cassius (xlii. 11), and he places it after the battle\r\nof Pharsalus (B.C. 48). Gabinius, after a hard march, reached Salonæ in\r\nDalmatia, where he was besieged by M. Octavius and died of disease.\r\n\r\n[341] L. Scribonius Libo commanded the ships before Brundusium with the\r\nview of preventing Antonius from crossing over to Macedonia. He was the\r\nfather-in-law of Sextus Pompeius, the son of Pompeius Magnus; and Cæsar\r\nOctavianus afterwards married Libo's sister Scribonia, as a matter of\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n[342] See the Life of Cæsar, c. 44.\r\n\r\n[343] P. Cornelius Dolabella, the son-in-law of Cicero, who complains of\r\nhis measures (Ep. _Ad Attic._ xi. 12, 14, 15; xiv. 21). Dolabella was in\r\ndebt himself and wished to be relieved. If he had lived in England, he\r\ncould easily have got relief. The story is told by Dion Cassius (xlii.\r\n29). The Romans _occasionally_ proposed sweeping measures for the\r\nsettlement of accounts between debtor and creditor. A modern nation has\r\na permanent court for \"the _relief_ of insolvent debtors;\" and a few\r\nyears ago a statute was passed in England (7 & 8 Vict. c. 96), which had\r\nthe direct effect of cancelling all debts under 20_l._; the debtors for\r\nwhose relief it was passed were well pleased, but the creditors grumbled\r\nloudly, and it was amended. Those who blame the Roman system of an\r\noccasional settlement of debts, should examine the operation of a\r\npermanent law which has the same object; and they will be assisted in\r\ncomparing English and Roman morality on this point by J.H. Elliott's\r\n'Credit the Life of Commerce,' London, Madden and Malcolm, 1845.\r\n\r\n[344] Fadia was the first wife of Antonius. His cousin Antonia was the\r\nsecond. Cicero's chief testimony against Antonius is contained in his\r\nSecond Philippic, which is full of vulgar abuse, both true and false.\r\n\r\n[345] She was sometimes called Volumnia, because she was a favourite of\r\nVolumnius. Cicero (_Ad Div._ ix. 26) speaks of dining in her company at\r\nthe house of Volumnius Eutrapolus.\r\n\r\n[346] Her first husband was P. Clodius, and she was his second wife. She\r\nhad two children by Clodius, a son and a daughter. The daughter married\r\nCæsar Octavianus B.C. 43 (c. 20). After the death of Clodius she married\r\nC. Scribonius Curio, the friend of Antonius, by whom she had one son,\r\nwho was put to death by Cæsar after the battle of Actium. Curio perished\r\nin Africa B.C. 49. In B.C. 46 Antonius married Fulvia, after divorcing\r\nAntonia, and he had two sons by her. Fulvia was very rich.\r\n\r\n[347] Cæsar returned from Iberia in the autumn of B.C. 45, after gaining\r\nthe battle of Munda. He was consul for the fifth time in B.C. 44 with\r\nAntonius; and also Dictator with M. Æmilius Lepidus for his Magister\r\nEquitum.\r\n\r\n[348] See the Life of Cæsar, c. 61.\r\n\r\n[349] Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 67, and of Brutus, c. 16.\r\n\r\n[350] Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 68, and of Brutus, c. 20. Dion\r\nCassius (xliv. 36-49) has given a long oration which Antonius made on\r\nthe occasion. It is not improbable that Dion may have had before him an\r\noration attributed to Antonius; nor is it at all improbable that the\r\nspeech of Antonius was published (Cic. _Ad Attic._ xiv. 11). Meyer\r\n(_Oratorum Romanorum Frag._ p. 455) considers this speech a fiction of\r\nDion and to be pure declamation. He thinks that which Appian has made\r\n(_Civil Wars_, ii. 144, &c.) tolerably well adapted to the character of\r\nAntonius. Appian, we know, often followed very closely genuine\r\ndocuments. Shakespere has made a speech for Antonius (_Julius Cæsar_)\r\nwhich would have suited the occasion well.\r\n\r\n[351] Charon was the ferryman over the river in the world below, which\r\nthe dead had to pass; hence the application of the term is intelligible.\r\nThe Romans' expression was Orcini, from Orcus (Sueton. _August._ c. 35).\r\n\r\n[352] See the Life of Cicero, c. 43, and Dion Cassius (xlv. 5) as to the\r\nmatter of the inheritance. A person who accepted a Roman inheritance\r\n(hereditas) took it with all the debts: the heir (heres), so far as\r\nconcerned the deceased's property, credits and debts, was the same\r\nperson as himself. There was no risk in taking the inheritance on\r\naccount of debts, for Cæsar left enormous sums of money: the risk was in\r\ntaking the name and with it the wealth and odium of the deceased. Cæsar\r\nmight have declined the inheritance, for he was not bound by law to take\r\nit. Cæsar had three-fourths of the Dictator's property, and Q. Pedius,\r\nalso a great-nephew of the Dictator, had the remainder.\r\n\r\n[353] See the Life of Cicero, c. 44.\r\n\r\n[354] Consuls in B.C. 43. See the Life of Cicero, c. 45. As to the\r\nspeech of Cicero, see Dion Cassius, xlv. 18, &c.\r\n\r\n[355] Lepidus was in Gallia Narbonensis. He advanced towards Antonius as\r\nfar as Forum Vocontiorum, and posted himself on the Argenteus, now the\r\nArgens. (Appian, _Civil Wars_, iii. 83; Dion. Cass. xlvi. 51, &c.;\r\nLetter of Munatius Plancus to Cicero, _Ad Div._ x. 17; Letter of Lepidus\r\nto Cicero, _Ad Div._ x. 34.) Lepidus and Antonius joined their forces on\r\nthe 29th of May, and Lepidus informed the Senate of the event in a\r\nletter, which is extant (Cic. _Ad Div._ x. 35).\r\n\r\n[356] Cotylon is \"cupman,\" or any equivalent term that will express a\r\ndrinker.\r\n\r\n[357] See the Life of Cicero, c. 46.\r\n\r\n[358] Appian (_Civil Wars_, iv. 2) states how they divided the empire\r\namong them; and Dion Cassius, xlvi. 55.\r\n\r\n[359] Cæsar was already betrothed to Servilia, the daughter of P.\r\nServilius Isauricus. When he quarrelled with Fulvia, he sent her back to\r\nher mother, still a maid. (Dion Cass. xlvi. 56.)\r\n\r\n[360] The number that was put to death was much larger than three\r\nhundred. Appian (_Civil Wars_, iv. 5) states the number of those who\r\nwere proscribed and whose property was confiscated at about 300 senators\r\nand 2000 equites. The object of the proscription was to get rid of\r\ntroublesome enemies and to raise money. The picture which Appian gives\r\nof the massacre is as horrible as the worst events of the French\r\nRevolution. He has drawn a striking picture by giving many individual\r\ninstances. Dion Cassius (xlvii. 3-8) has also described the events of\r\nthe proscription.\r\n\r\n[361] This was a crime which would shock the Romans, for the Three not\r\nonly seized deposits, which the depositary was legally bound to give to\r\nthe owner, but they seized them in the hands of the Vestals, where they\r\nwere protected by the sanctity of religion.\r\n\r\n[362] Compare the Life of Brutus, c. 41, &c., as to the events in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[363] See the Life of Brutus, c. 26, &c.\r\n\r\n[364] Antonius crossed over to Asia in B.C. 41. In the latter part of\r\nB.C. 42, Cæsar was ill at Brundusium, and in B.C. 41 he was engaged in a\r\ncivil war with L. Antonius, the brother of Marcus, and Fulvia the wife\r\nof Antonius. These are the civil commotions to which Plutarch alludes.\r\nCæsar besieged L. Antonius in Perusia in B.C. 41, and took him prisoner.\r\n\r\n[365] He was a prætor in B.C. 43, and consul in B.C. 39.\r\n\r\n[366] The great distinctions that he received are recorded by Strabo\r\n(xiv. p. 648, ed. Casaub.). It is not in modern times only that dancers\r\nand fiddlers have received wealth and honours.\r\n\r\n[367] The quotation is from the King OEdipus, v. 4.\r\n\r\n[368] Bacchus had many names, as he had various qualities. As Omestes he\r\nwas the \"cruel;\" and as Agrionius the \"wild and savage.\" One of his\r\nfestivals was called Agrionia.\r\n\r\n[369] He was an orator, and also something of a soldier, for he\r\nsuccessfully opposed Labienus, B.C. 40, when he invaded Asia (c. 28).\r\n\r\n[370] There are many ways of flattery, as there are many ways of doing\r\nvarious things. Plutarch here gives a hint, which persons in high places\r\nmight find useful. Open flattery can only deceive a fool, and it is\r\nseldom addressed to any but a fool, unless the flatterer himself be so\r\ngreat a fool as not to know a wise man from a foolish: which is\r\nsometimes the case. But there is flattery, as Plutarch intimates, which\r\naddresses itself, not in the guise of flattery, but in the guise of\r\ntruth, one of the characters of which is plain speaking. It is hard for\r\na man in an exalted station to be always proof against flattery, for it\r\nis often not easy to detect it. Nor in the intercourse of daily life is\r\nit always easy to distinguish between him who gives you his honest\r\nadvice and opinion, and him who gives it merely to please you, or, what\r\nis often worse, merely to please himself.\r\n\r\n[371] Nothing is known of him, unless he be the person mentioned in c.\r\n59. Kaltwasser conjectures that he may be the Dellius or Delius to whom\r\nHorace has addressed an ode. (_Carm._ iii. 2). _See_ c. 1, note.\r\n\r\n[372] Plutarch alludes to the passage in Homer (_Iliad_, xiv. 162) where\r\nJuno bedecks herself to captivate Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[373] She was now about twenty-eight years of age. Kaltwasser suggests\r\nthat the words \"and Cnæus the son of Pompeius\" must be an interpolation,\r\nbecause nothing is known of his amours with Cleopatra. But if this be\r\nso, other words which follow in the next sentence must have been altered\r\nwhen the interpolation was made.\r\n\r\n[374] Antonius was at Tarsus on the river Cydnus when Cleopatra paid him\r\nthis visit, B.C. 41. Shakespere has used this passage of Plutarch in his\r\n\"Antony and Cleopatra,\" act ii. sc. 2--\r\n\r\n   \"The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,\r\n    Burnt on the water,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[375] Plutarch has given a long list of languages which this learned\r\nqueen spoke. With Arabic and all the cognate dialects, it is probable\r\nenough that she was familiar, but we can hardly believe that she took\r\npains to learn the barbarous language of the wretched Troglodytes, who\r\nlived in holes on the west coast of the Red Sea. Diodorus (iii. 32)\r\ndescribes their habits after the authority of Agatharchides.\r\n\r\nCleopatra's face on the coins is not handsome. On some of them she is\r\nrepresented on the same coin with Antonius.\r\n\r\n[376] He was a son of T. Labienus, who served under Cæsar in Gaul and\r\nafterwards went over to Pompeius (Life of Cæsar, c. 34). The father fell\r\nin the battle of Munda, B.C. 45.\r\n\r\nLabienus, the son, was sent by the party of Brutus and Cassius to\r\nParthia to get assistance from king Orodes. He heard of the battle of\r\nPhilippi while he was in Parthia and before he had accomplished his\r\nmission; and he stayed with the Parthians. In the campaign here alluded\r\nto Labienus and the Parthians took Apameia and Antiocheia in Syria.\r\nLabienus, after invading the south-western part of Asia Minor (B.C. 40),\r\nwas forced to fly before Ventidius; and he was seized in Cilicia by a\r\nfreedman of Julius Cæsar. (Dion Cass. xlviii. 40.)\r\n\r\n[377] Amphissa was a town of the Locri Ozolæ.\r\n\r\nPhilotas studied at Alexandria, which was then a great school of\r\nmedicine. We have here an anecdote about Antonius which rests on more\r\ndirect testimony than many well-received stories of modern days.\r\n\r\nThe bragging physician must have been a stupid fellow to be silenced by\r\nsuch a syllogism. I have translated [Greek: pôs pyrettôn], like\r\nKaltwasser, \"Wer _einigermassen_ das Fieber hat,\" &c., which is the\r\ncorrect translation.\r\n\r\nThe text probably means that Philotas was appointed physician to\r\nAntyllus.\r\n\r\n[378] The passage to which Plutarch alludes is in the Gorgias, p. 464.\r\n\r\n[379] A great trade was carried on in those times in dried fish from the\r\nPontic or Black Sea. See Strabo, p. 320, ed. Casaub.\r\n\r\n[380] It was near the end of B.C. 40 that Antonius was roused from his\r\n\"sleep and drunken debauch.\" He sailed from Alexandria to Tyrus in\r\nPhoenicia, and thence by way of Cyprus and Rhodes to Athens, where he\r\nsaw Fulvia, who had escaped thither from Brundusium. He left her sick at\r\nSikyon, and crossed from Corcyra (Corfu) to Italy. (Appian, _Civil\r\nWars_, v. 52-55.) Brundusium shut her gates against him, on which he\r\ncommenced the siege of the city. The war was stopped by the\r\nreconciliation that is mentioned in the text, to which the news of the\r\ndeath of Fulvia greatly contributed. Antonius had left her at Sikyon\r\nwithout taking leave of her, and vexation and disease put an end to her\r\nturbulent life. (Appian, _Civil Wars_, v. 59.)\r\n\r\n[381] See the Life of Cicero, c. 44, note.\r\n\r\n[382] The meeting with Sextus Pompeius was in B.C. 39, at Cape Miseno,\r\nwhich is the northern point of the Gulf of Naples.\r\n\r\nSextus was the second son of Pompeius Magnus. He was now master of a\r\nlarge fleet, and having the command of the sea, he cut off the supplies\r\nfrom Rome. The consequence was a famine and riots in the city. (Appian,\r\n_Civil Wars_, v. 67, &c.) Antonius slaughtered many of the rioters, and\r\ntheir bodies were thrown into the Tiber. This restored order; \"but the\r\nfamine,\" says Appian, \"was at its height, and the people groaned and\r\nwere quiet.\"\r\n\r\n[383] P. Ventidius Bassus was what the Romans call a \"novus homo,\" the\r\nfirst of his family who distinguished himself at Rome. He had the\r\ncourage of a soldier and the talents of a true general. When a child he\r\nwas made prisoner with his mother in the Marsian war (Dion Cass. xliii.\r\n51), and he appeared in the triumphal procession of Pompeius Strabo\r\n(Dion Cass. xlix. 21). The captive lived to figure as the principal\r\nperson in his own triumph, B.C. 38. In his youth he supported himself by\r\na mean occupation. Hoche, when he was a common soldier, used to\r\nembroider waistcoats. Julius Cæsar discovered the talents of Bassus, and\r\ngave him employment suited to his abilities. In B.C. 43 he was Prætor\r\nand in the same year Consul Suffectus. (Drumann, _Antonii_, p. 439;\r\nGell. xv. 4.)\r\n\r\n[384] Cockfighting pleased a Roman, as it used to do an Englishman. The\r\nAthenians used to fight quails.\r\n\r\n[385] The name is written indifferently Hyrodes or Orodes (see the Life\r\nof Crassus, c. 18).\r\n\r\nPlutarch, on this as on many other occasions, takes no pains to state\r\nfacts with accuracy. Labienus lost his life and the Parthians were\r\ndefeated; and that was enough for his purpose. The facts are stated more\r\ncircumstantially by Dion Cassius (xlviii. 40, 41).\r\n\r\n[386] The president of the gymnastic exercises. Dion Cassius (xlviii.\r\n39) tells us something that is characteristic of Antonius. The fulsome\r\nflattery of the Athenians gave him on this occasion the title of the\r\nyoung Bacchus, and they betrothed the goddess Minerva to him. Antonius\r\nsaid he was well content with the match; and to show that he was in\r\nearnest he demanded of them a contribution of one million drachmæ as a\r\nportion with his new wife. He thus fleeced them of about 2800_l._\r\nsterling. No doubt Antonius relished the joke as well as the money.\r\n\r\n[387] The sacred olive was in the Erektheium on the Acropolis of Athens.\r\nPausanias (i. 28) mentions a fountain on the Acropolis near the\r\nPropylæa; and this is probably what Plutarch calls Clepsydra, or a\r\nwater-clock. The name Clepsydra is given to a spring in Messenia by\r\nPausanias (iv. 31). Kaltwasser supposes the name Clepsydra to have been\r\ngiven because such a spring was intermittent. Such a spring the younger\r\nPliny describes (Ep. iv. 30).\r\n\r\n[388] The defeat of Pacorus (B.C. 38) is told by Dion Cassius (xlix.\r\n19). The ode of Horace (_Carm._ iii. 6) in which he mentions Pacorus\r\nseems to have been written before this victory, and after the defeat of\r\nDecidius Saxa (B.C. 40; Dion, xlviii. 25).\r\n\r\n[389] Commagene on the west bordered on Cilicia and Cappadocia. The\r\ncapital was Samosata, on the Euphrates, afterwards the birthplace of\r\nLucian. This Antiochus was attacked by Pompeius B.C. 65, who concluded a\r\npeace with him and extended his dominions (Appian _Mithrid._ 106, &c.).\r\n\r\n[390] C. Sossius was made governor of Syria and Cilicia by Antonius. He\r\ntook the island and town of Aradus on the coast of Phoenice (B.C. 38);\r\nand captured Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n[391] P. Canidius Crassus. His campaign against the Iberi of Asia is\r\ndescribed by Dion Cassius (xlix. 24).\r\n\r\n[392] Antonius and Cæsar met at Tarentum (Taranto) in the spring of B.C.\r\n37. The events of this meeting are circumstantially detailed by Appian\r\n(_Civil Wars_, v. 93, &c.). Dion Cassius (xlviii. 54) says that the\r\nmeeting was in the winter.\r\n\r\n[393] M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the constant friend of Cæsar, and afterwards\r\nthe husband of his daughter Julia. Mæcenas, the patron of Virgil and\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\n[394] [Greek: Myoparônes] are said to be light ships, such as pirates\r\nuse, adapted for quick sailing.\r\n\r\n[395] Cæsar spent this year in making preparation against Sextus\r\nPompeius. In B.C. 36 Pompeius was defeated on the coast of Sicily. He\r\nfled into Asia, and was put to death at Miletus by M. Titius, who\r\ncommanded under Antonius (Appian, _Civil Wars_, v. 97-121).\r\n\r\n[396] The passage to which Plutarch alludes is in the Phædrus, p. 556.\r\n\r\n[397] That is, the Ocean, as opposed to the Internal Sea or the\r\nMediterranean. Kaltwasser proposes to alter the text to \"internal sea,\"\r\nfor no sufficient reason.\r\n\r\n[398] This was the Antigonus who fell into the hands of Sossius, when he\r\ntook Jerusalem on the Sabbath, as Pompeius Magnus had done. (Life of\r\nPompeius, 39; Dion Cassius, xlix. 22, and the notes of Reimarus.)\r\nAntigonus was tied to a stake and whipped before he was beheaded. The\r\nkingdom of Judæa was given to Herodes, the son of Antipater.\r\n\r\n[399] Plutarch probably alludes to some laws of Solon against bastardy.\r\n\r\n[400] A common name of the Parthian kings (see the Life of Crassus, c.\r\n33). This Parthian war of Antonius took place in B.C. 36.\r\n\r\n[401] See Plutarch's Life of Themistocles, c. 29. It was an eastern\r\nfashion to grant a man a country, or a town and its district, for his\r\nmaintenance and to administer. Fidelity to the giver was of course\r\nexpected. The gift was a kind of fief.\r\n\r\n[402] Among the Persians, and as it here appears among the Parthians,\r\n\"to send a right hand\" was an offer of peace and friendship (Xenophon,\r\n_Anab._ ii. 4, who uses the expression \"right hands\").\r\n\r\n[403] The desert tract in the northern part of Mesopotamia is meant.\r\n\r\n[404] There is error as to the number of cavalry of Artavasdes either\r\nhere or in c. 50. See the notes of Kaltwasser and Sintenis: and as to\r\nArtavasdes, Life of Crassus, c. 19, 33, and Dion Cassius, xlix. 25.\r\n\r\n[405] No doubt Iberians of Spain are meant.\r\n\r\n[406] Was the most south-western part of Media, and it comprehended the\r\nchief part of the modern Azerbijan.\r\n\r\n[407] Dion Cassius (xlix. 25) names the place Phraaspa or Praaspa, which\r\nmay be the right name. The position of the place and the direction of\r\nthe march of Antonius are unknown.\r\n\r\n[408] Was a king of Pontus: he was ransomed for a large sum of money.\r\nReimarus says in a note to Dion Cassius (xlix. 25) that Plutarch states\r\nthat Polemon was killed. The learned editor must have read this chapter\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n[409] See Life of Crassus, c. 10.\r\n\r\n[410] [Greek: hoi gnôrimôtatoi], which Kaltwasser translates \"those who\r\nwere most acquainted with the Romans;\" and his translation may be right.\r\n\r\n[411] Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, which is the Roman mode of writing the\r\nword. He was the son of Domitius who was taken by Cæsar in Corfinium\r\n(Life of Cæsar, c. 34); and he is the Domitius who deserted Antonius\r\njust before the battle of Actium (c. 63).\r\n\r\n[412] The Mardi inhabited a tract on the south coast of the Caspian,\r\nwhere there was a river Mardus or Amardus.\r\n\r\nPlutarch has derived his narrative of the retreat from some account by\r\nan eye-witness, but though it is striking as a picture, it is quite\r\nuseless as a military history. The route is not designated any further\r\nthan this, that Antonius had to pass through a plain and desert country.\r\nIt is certain that he advanced considerably east of the Tigris, and he\r\nexperienced the same difficulties that Crassus did in the northern part\r\nof Mesopotamia. (Strabo, p. 523, ed. Casaub. as to the narrative of\r\nAdelphius, and Casaubon's note.)\r\n\r\n[413] These were used by the slingers (funditores) in the Roman army.\r\n\r\n[414] [Greek: ep' ouran], Sintenis: but the MS. reading is [Greek: ap'\r\nouras], \"from the rear.\" See the note of Schaefer, and of Sintenis.\r\n\r\n[415] Contrary to Parthian practice. Compare the Life of Crassus, c. 27.\r\n\r\n[416] These are the soldiers in full armour. Sintenis refers to the Life\r\nof Crassus, c. 25. See life of Antonius, c. 49, [Greek: hoi de hoplitai\r\n... tois thyreois].\r\n\r\n[417] The Romans called this mode of defence Testudo, or tortoise. It is\r\ndescribed by Dion Cassius (xlix. 30). The testudo was also used in\r\nassaulting a city or wall. A cut of one from the Antonine column is\r\ngiven in Smith's Dict. of Antiquities, art. Testudo.\r\n\r\n[418] The forty-eighth part of a medimnus. The medimnus is estimated at\r\n11 gal. 7·1456 pints English. The drachma (Attic) is reckoned at about\r\n9-3/4d. (Smith's Dict. of Antiquities.) But the scarcity is best shown\r\nby the fact that barley bread was as dear as silver. Compare Xenophon\r\n(_Anab._ i. 5, 6) as to the prices in the army of Cyrus, when it was\r\nmarching through the desert.\r\n\r\n[419] The allusion is to the retreat of the Greeks in the army of Cyrus\r\nfrom the plain of Cunaxa over the highlands of Armenia to Trapezus\r\n(Trebizond); which is the main subject of the Anabasis of Xenophon.\r\n\r\n[420] Salt streams occur on the high lands of Asia. Mannert, quoted by\r\nKaltwasser, supposes that the stream here spoken of is one that flows\r\nnear Tabriz and then joins another river. If this were the only salt\r\nstream that Antonius could meet with on his march, the conclusion of the\r\nGerman geographer might be admitted.\r\n\r\n[421] The modern Aras. The main branch of the river rises in the same\r\nmountain mass in which a branch of the Euphrates rises, about 39° 47' N.\r\nlat., 41° 9' E. long. It joins the Cyrus or Kur, which comes from the\r\nCaucasus, about thirty miles above the entrance of the united stream\r\ninto the Caspian Sea. Mannert, quoted by Kaltwasser, conjectures that\r\nAntonius crossed the river at Julfa (38° 54' N. lat.). It is well to\r\ncall it a conjecture. Anybody may make another, with as much reason.\r\nTwenty-seven days' march (c. 50) brought the Romans from Phraata to the\r\nAraxes, but the point of departure and the point where the army crossed\r\nthe Araxes are both unknown.\r\n\r\n[422] The second expedition of Antonius into Armenia was in B.C. 34,\r\nwhen he advanced to the Araxes. After the triumph, Artavasdes was kept\r\nin captivity, and he was put to death by Cleopatra in Egypt after the\r\nbattle of Actium, B.C. 30 (Dion Cassius xlix. 41, &c).\r\n\r\n[423] Compare Dion Cassius, xlix. 51.\r\n\r\n[424] The name is written both Phraates and Phrates in the MSS.\r\n\r\n[425] She went to Athens in B.C. 35.\r\n\r\n[426] In B.C. 34, Antonius invaded Armenia and got Artavasdes the king\r\ninto his power. The Median king with whom Antonius made this marriage\r\nalliance (B.C. 33) was also named Artavasdes. Alexander, the son of\r\nAntonius by Cleopatra, was married to Jotape, a daughter of this Median\r\nking.\r\n\r\n[427] This is Plutarch's word. Its precise meaning is not clear, but it\r\nmay be collected from the context. It was something like a piece of\r\ntheatrical pomp.\r\n\r\n[428] Or Cidaris. (See Life of Pompeius, c. 33.) The Cittaris seems to\r\nbe the higher and upright part of the tiara; and sometimes to be used in\r\nthe same sense as tiara. The Causia was a Macedonian hat with a broad\r\nbrim. (See Smith's Dict. of Antiquities.)\r\n\r\n[429] After the defeat of Sextus Pompeius, Lepidus made a claim to\r\nSicily and attempted a campaign there against Cæsar. But this feeble man\r\nwas compelled to surrender. He was deprived of all power, and sent to\r\nlive in Italy. He still retained his office of Pontifex Maximus (Appian,\r\n_Civil Wars_, v. 126; Dion Cassius, xlix. 11).\r\n\r\n[430] This is an emendation of Amiot in place of the corrupt word\r\nLaurians.\r\n\r\n[431] The preparation was making in B.C. 32. Antonius spent the winter\r\nof this year at Patræ in Achæa.\r\n\r\n[432] An account of these exactions is given by Dion Cassius (l. 10).\r\nThey show to what a condition a people can be reduced by tyranny.\r\n\r\n[433] Such is the nature of the people. It is hard to rouse them; and\r\ntheir patience is proved by all the facts of history.\r\n\r\n[434] It was usual with the Romans, at least with men of rank, to\r\ndeposit their wills with the Vestals for safe keeping.\r\n\r\n[435] This great library at Alexandria is said to have been destroyed\r\nduring the Alexandrine war. See the Life of Cæsar, c. 49.\r\n\r\n[436] The translators are much puzzled to explain this. Kaltwasser\r\nconjectures that Antonius in consequence of losing some wager was\r\nrequired to do this servile act; and accordingly he translates part of\r\nthe Greek text \"in consequence of a wager that had been made.\"\r\n\r\n[437] The only person of the name who is known as an active partizan at\r\nthis time was C. Furnius, tribune of the plebs, B.C. 50. He was a\r\nlegatus under M. Antonius in Asia in B.C. 35. Here Plutarch represents\r\nhim as a partizan of Cæsar. If Plutarch's Furnius was the tribune, he\r\nmust have changed sides already. As to his eloquence, there is no\r\nfurther evidence of it than what we have here.\r\n\r\n[438] C. Calvisius Sabinus, who was consul B.C. 39 with L. Marcius\r\nCensorinus.\r\n\r\n[439] The name occurs in Horace, 1 Sat. 5; but the two may be different\r\npersons. As to the Roman Deliciæ see the note of Coraes; and Suetonius,\r\n_Augustus_, c. 83.\r\n\r\n[440] Dion Cassius (l. 4) also states that war was declared only against\r\nCleopatra, but that Antonius was deprived of all the powers that had\r\nbeen given to him.\r\n\r\n[441] Now Pesaro in Umbria.\r\n\r\n[442] See Pausanias, i. 25. 2.\r\n\r\n[443] The text of Bryan has, \"and Deiotarus, king of the Galatians:\" and\r\nSchaefer follows it. But see the note of Sintenis.\r\n\r\n[444] Actium is a promontory on the southern side of the entrance of the\r\nAmbraciot Gulf, now the gulf of Arta. It is probably the point of land\r\nnow called La Punta. The width of the entrance of the gulf is about half\r\na mile. Nicopolis, \"the city of Victory,\" was built by Cæsar on the\r\nnorthern side of the gulf, a few miles from the site of Prevesa. The\r\nbattle of Actium was fought on the 2nd of September, B.C. 31. It is more\r\nminutely described by Dion Cassius (l. 31, &c.; li. 1).\r\n\r\n[445] This word means something to stir up a pot with, a ladle or\r\nsomething of the kind. The joke is as dull as it could be.\r\n\r\n[446] Sintenis observes that Plutarch has here omitted to mention the\r\nplace of Arruntius, who had the centre of Cæsar's line (c. 66). C.\r\nSossius commanded the left of the line of Antonius. Insteius is a Roman\r\nname, as appears from inscriptions. Taurus is T. Statilius Taurus.\r\n\r\n[447] There is some confusion in the text here, but the general meaning\r\nis probably what I have given. See the note of Sintenis.\r\n\r\n[448] These were light vessels adapted for quick evolutions. Horace,\r\n_Epod._ i., alludes to them:--\r\n\r\n   \"Ibis Liburnis inter alta navium,\r\n       Amice, propugnacula.\"\r\n\r\n[449] Is the most southern point of the Peloponnesus, in Laconica. The\r\nmodern name of Tænarus is Matapan or \"head.\"\r\n\r\n[450] Dion Cassius (li. 2) gives an account of Cæsar's behaviour after\r\nthe battle. He exacted money from the cities; but Dion does not mention\r\nany particular cities.\r\n\r\n[451] By \"all the citizens\" Plutarch means the citizens of his native\r\ntown Chæronea. The people had to carry their burden a considerable\r\ndistance, for this Antikyra was on the Corinthian gulf, nearly south of\r\nDelphi. This anecdote, which is supported by undoubted authority, is a\r\ngood example of the sufferings of the people during this contest for\r\npower between two men.\r\n\r\n[452] This was a town on the coast in the country called Marmarica. It\r\nhad a port and was fortified, and thus served as a frontier post to\r\nEgypt against attacks from the west.\r\n\r\n[453] See the Life of Brutus, c. 50.\r\n\r\n[454] He was L. Pinarius Carpus, who had fought under him at Philippi.\r\nCarpus gave up his troops to Cornelius Gallus, who advanced upon him\r\nfrom the province Africa (Dion. Cass. l. 5, where he is called Scarpus\r\nin the text of Reimarus).\r\n\r\n[455] Or \"Sea that lies off Egypt,\" that part of the Mediterranean which\r\nborders on Egypt. The width of the Isthmus is much more than 300 stadia:\r\nit is about seventy-two miles. Herodotus (ii. 158) states the width more\r\ncorrectly at one thousand stadia.\r\n\r\nIn this passage Plutarch calls the Red Sea both the Arabian gulf and the\r\nErythra (Red), and in this he agrees with Herodotus. The Arabian Gulf or\r\nmodern Red Sea was considered a part of the great Erythræan Sea or\r\nIndian Ocean. Herodotus (ii. 11) says that there is a gulf which runs\r\ninto the land from the Erythræan sea; and this gulf he calls (ii. 11,\r\n158) the Arabian gulf, which is now the Red Sea. See Anton, c. 3.\r\n\r\n[456] See the Life of Pompeius, c. 41.\r\n\r\n[457] The Pharos was an island opposite to Alexandria, and connected\r\nwith it by a dike called Heptastadion, the length being seven stadia.\r\n\r\n[458] Shakspere has made a play out of the meagre subject of Timon, and\r\nLucian has a dialogue entitled \"Timon or the Misanthropist.\" (Comp.\r\nStrab. 794, ed. Cas.)\r\n\r\n[459] This was the second day of the third Dionysiac festival, called\r\nthe Anthesteria. The first day was Pithoegia ([Greek: pithoigia]) or the\r\ntapping of the jars of wine; and the second day, as the word Choes seems\r\nto import, was the cup day.\r\n\r\n[460] This was Herodes I., son of Antipater, sometimes called the Great.\r\nHe was not at the battle of Actium, but he sent aid to Antonius (c. 61).\r\n\r\n[461] This was the toga virilis, or dress which denoted that a male was\r\npubes, fourteen at least, and had attained full legal capacity. The\r\nprætexta, which was worn up to the time of assuming the toga virilis,\r\nhad a broad purple border, by which the impubes was at once\r\ndistinguished from other persons.\r\n\r\nCleopatra's son, Cæsarion, was registered as an Alexandrine. The son of\r\nAntonius was treated as a Roman citizen.\r\n\r\n[462] This seems to be the sense of the passage. The Greek for asp is\r\naspis. Some suppose that it is the poisonous snake which the Arabs call\r\nEl Haje, which measures from three to five feet in length. But this is\r\nrather too large to be put in a basket of figs.\r\n\r\n[463] Conjectured by M. du Soul to be Alexander the Syrian, who has been\r\nmentioned before.\r\n\r\n[464] He was a native of Alexandria, and had been carried prisoner to\r\nRome by Gabinius. He obtained his freedom, and acquired celebrity as a\r\nrhetorician and historian. He was a favourite of Asinius Pollio and of\r\nAugustus; but he was too free-spoken for Augustus, who finally forbade\r\nhim his house (Horat. 1. _Ep._ 19, 15; and the note of Orelli). Life of\r\nPompeius, c. 49.\r\n\r\nDion Cassius (li. 8), who believed every scandalous story, says that\r\nCæsar made love to Cleopatra through the medium of Thyrsus.\r\n\r\n[465] After the battle of Actium, Cæsar crossed over to Samos, where he\r\nspent the winter. He was recalled by the news of a mutiny among the\r\nsoldiers, who had not received their promised reward. He returned to\r\nBrundusium, where he stayed twenty-seven days, and he went no further,\r\nfor his appearance in Italy stopped the disturbance. He returned to Asia\r\nand marched through Syria to Egypt (Sueton. _Aug._ c. 17; Dion Cassius,\r\nli. 4).\r\n\r\n[466] The shout of Bacchanals at the festivals. See the Ode of Horace\r\n(_Carm._ ii. 19):\r\n\r\n   Evoe, recenti mens trepidat metu.\r\n\r\n[467] The fleet passed over to Cæsar on the 1st of August (Orosius, vi.\r\n19). The treachery of Cleopatra is not improbable (Dion Cass. li. 10).\r\n\r\n[468] Compare Dion Cassius, li. 10.\r\n\r\n[469] His name was C. Proculeius. He appears to be the person to whom\r\nHorace alludes (Carm. ii. 2).\r\n\r\n[470] Dion Cassius (li. 11) says that Cleopatra communicated to Cæsar\r\nthe death of Antonius, which is not so probable as Plutarch's narrative.\r\n\r\n[471] C. Cornelius Gallus, a Roman Eques, who had advanced from the\r\nprovince Africa upon Egypt. He was afterwards governor of Egypt; but he\r\nincurred the displeasure of Augustus, and put an end to life B.C. 26.\r\nGallus was a poet, and a friend of Virgil and Ovid. The tenth Eclogue of\r\nVirgil is addressed to Gallus.\r\n\r\n[472] Said to have been a Stoic, and much admired by Augustus (Dion\r\nCass. li. 16; Sueton. _Aug._ 89).\r\n\r\n[473] Probably the same that is mentioned in the Life of Cato the\r\nYounger, c. 57.\r\n\r\n[474] The circumstances of the death of Antyllus and Cæsarion are not\r\ntold in the same way by Dion Cassius (li. 15). Antyllus had been\r\nbetrothed to Cæsar's daughter Julia in B.C. 36.\r\n\r\n[475] The words are borrowed from Homer (_Iliad_, ii. 204):--\r\n\r\n   [Greek: Ouk agathon polykoiraniê.]\r\n\r\nThere could be no reason for putting Cæsarion to death as a possible\r\ncompetitor with Cæsar at Rome, for he was not a Roman citizen. As it was\r\nCæsar's object to keep Egypt, Cæsarion would have been an obstacle\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[476] There were, as usual in such matters, various versions of this\r\ninterview: it was a fit subject for embellishment with the writers of\r\nspurious history. The account of Plutarch is much simpler and more\r\nnatural than that of Dion Cassius (li. 12), which savours of the\r\nrhetorical.\r\n\r\n[477] He was the son of P. Cornelius Dolabella, once the son-in-law of\r\nCicero, and one of Cæsar's murderers. His son P. Cornelius Dolabella was\r\nconsul A.D. 10.\r\n\r\n[478] The word \"companions\" represents the Roman \"comites,\" which has a\r\ntechnical meaning. Young men of rank, who were about the person of a\r\ncommander, and formed a kind of staff, were his Comites. See Horat. I.\r\nEp. 8.\r\n\r\n[479] The story of Dion (li. 14) is that Cæsar, after he had seen the\r\nbody, sent for the Psylli, serpent charmers, to suck out the poison\r\n(compare Lucan, _Pharsal._ ix. 925). If a person was not dead, it was\r\nsupposed that the Psylli could extract the poison and save the life.\r\n\r\nDion Cassius also states that the true cause of Cleopatra's death was\r\nunknown. One account was that she punctured her arm with a hair-pin\r\n([Greek: belonê]) which was poisoned. But even as to the punctures on the\r\narm, Plutarch does not seem to state positively that there were any. The\r\n\"hollow comb\" is hardly intelligible. Plutarch's word is [Greek:\r\nknêstis], \"a scraping instrument of any kind.\" One MS. has\r\n[Greek: kistis], \"a small coffer.\" Strabo (p. 795, ed. Casaub.) doubts\r\nwhether she perished by the bite of a serpent or by puncturing herself\r\nwith a poisoned instrument. Propertius (iii. 11, 53) alludes to the\r\nimage of Cleopatra, which was carried in the triumph--\r\n\r\n   Brachia spectavi sacris admorsa colubris\r\n     Et trahere occultum membra soporis iter.\r\n\r\nAn ancient marble at Rome represents Cleopatra with the asp on her arm.\r\nThere was also a story of her applying it to the left breast.\r\n\r\nCleopatra was born in B.C. 69, and died in the latter part of B.C. 30.\r\nShe was seventeen years of age when her father Ptolemæus Auletes died:\r\nand upon his death she governed jointly with her brother Ptolemæus,\r\nwhose wife she was to be. Antonius first saw her when he was in Egypt\r\nwith Gabinius, and he had not forgotten the impression which the young\r\ngirl then made on him at the time when she visited him at Tarsus\r\n(Appian, _Civil Wars_, v. 8). Antonius was forty years old when he saw\r\nCleopatra at Tarsus, B.C. 41, and he would therefore be in his\r\nfifty-second year at the time of his death (Clinton, _Fasti_).\r\n\r\n[480] Octavia's care of the children of Antonius is one of the beautiful\r\ntraits of her character. She is one of those Roman women whose virtues\r\ncommand admiration.\r\n\r\nCleopatra, the daughter of Antonius and twin sister of Alexander,\r\nmarried Juba II., king of Numidia, by whom she had a son Ptolemæus, who\r\nsucceeded his father, and a daughter Drusilla, who married Antonius\r\nFelix, the governor of Judæa. The two brothers of Cleopatra were\r\nAlexander and Ptolemæus.\r\n\r\nAntonius, the son of Fulvia, was called Iulus Antonius. He married\r\nMarcella, one of the daughters of Octavia. In B.C. 10, Antonius was\r\nconsul. He formed an adulterous intercourse with Julia, the daughter of\r\nAugustus, which cost him his life B.C. 2. Antonius was a poet, as it\r\nseems (Horat. _Carm._ iv. 2, and Orelli's note).\r\n\r\nThe elder Antonia, the daughter of Octavia and Antonius, married L.\r\nDomitius Ahenobarbus, the son of Cneius, who deserted to Cæsar just\r\nbefore the battle of Actium. This Lucius had by Antonia a son, Cn.\r\nDomitius Ahenobarbus, who married Agrippina, the daughter of Cæsar\r\nGermanicus. Agrippina's son, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was adopted by the\r\nemperor Claudius after his marriage with Agrippina, and Lucius then took\r\nthe name of Nero Claudius Cæsar Drusus. As the emperor Nero his infamy\r\nis imperishable.\r\n\r\nThe younger Antonia, the daughter of Octavia and Antonius, married\r\nDrusus, the second son of Tiberius Claudius Nero. Tiberius had divorced\r\nhis wife Livia in order that Cæsar Octavianus might become her husband.\r\nThe virtues of Antonia are recorded by Plutarch and others: her beauty\r\nis testified by her handsome face on a medal.\r\n\r\nThe expression of Plutarch that Caius, by whom he means Caius Caligula,\r\n\"ruled with distinction,\" has caused the commentators some difficulty,\r\nand they have proposed to read [Greek: epimanôs], \"like a madman\" in\r\nplace of [Greek: epiphanôs], \"with distinction.\" Perhaps\r\nPlutarch's meaning may be something like what I have given, and he may\r\nallude to the commencement of Caligula's reign, which gave good hopes,\r\nas Suetonius shows. Some would get over the difficulty by giving to\r\n[Greek: epiphanôs] a different meaning from the common meaning. See\r\nKaltwasser's note.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Antonius (see Notes to Brutus, c. 52) would be an idle\r\nimpertinence. He is portrayed clear and distinct in this inimitable Life\r\nof Plutarch.\r\n\r\nHere ends the Tragedy of Antonius and Cleopatra; and after it begins the\r\nMonarchy, as Plutarch would call it, or the sole rule of Augustus. See\r\nthe Preface to the First Volume.\r\n\r\n[481] Of Athens.\r\n\r\n[482] The various stories about Plato's slavery are discussed in Grote's\r\n'History of Greece,' part ii. ch. 53.\r\n\r\n[483] Aristomache and Arete.\r\n\r\n[484] Periodical northerly winds or monsoons.\r\n\r\n[485] The ceremony of the libations seems to correspond to our \"grace\r\nafter meat.\" See vol. i. Life of Perikles, ch. 7.\r\n\r\n[486] Grote paraphrases this passage as follows:--\"A little squadron was\r\nprepared, of no more than five merchantmen, two of them vessels of\r\nthirty oars, &c.\" On consulting Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, s.v.\r\n[Greek: triakontoros], I find a reference to Thuc. iv. 9; where a\r\nMessenian pirate triaconter is spoken of, and for further information\r\nthe reader is referred to the article \"[Greek: pentêkontoros] (sc.\r\n[Greek: naus]), [Greek: hê], a ship of burden with fifty oars,\" Pind.\r\nP. 4. 436, Eur. I.T. 1124, Thuc. i., 14, &c. But none of these passages\r\nbear out the sense of a \"vessel of burden.\" The passage in Pindar merely\r\nstates that the snake which Jason slew was as big or bigger than a\r\n[Greek: pentêkontoros]. Herod, ii. 163, distinctly says \"not ships of\r\nburden, but penteconters.\" In Eur. I.T. 1124, the chorus merely remark\r\nthat Iphigenia will be borne home by a penteconter, while Thucydides (i.\r\n14) explicitly states that, many generations after the Trojan war, the\r\nchief navies of Greece consisted of but few triremes, and chiefly of\r\n\"penteconters or of long ships equipped like them.\" From these passages\r\nI am inclined to think that the true meaning of the passage is the\r\nliteral one, that the soldiers were placed on board of two transports,\r\nthat the two triaconters, or thirty-oared galleys, were ships of war and\r\nacted as convoy to them, and that the small vessel was intended for Dion\r\nand his friends to escape in if necessary. In Dem. Zen. a [Greek:\r\npentêkontoros] undoubtedly is spoken of as a merchant vessel; but this\r\ndoes not prove that there were no war penteconters in Dion's time.\r\n\r\n[487] Kerkina and Kerkinitis, two low islands off the north coast of\r\nAfrica, in the mouth of the Lesser Syrtis, united by a bridge and\r\npossessing a fine harbour. 'Dictionary of Antiquities.'\r\n\r\n[488] The Greek word is [Greek: kontos], which is singularly near in\r\nsound to the East Anglian \"quant.\"\r\n\r\n[489] This seems to be the universally accepted emendation of the\r\nunmeaning words in the original text. Grote remarks \"The statue and\r\nsacred ground of Apollo Temenites was the most remarkable feature in\r\nthis portion of Syracuse, and would naturally be selected to furnish a\r\nname for the gate.\" 'Hist. of Greece,' part ii. ch. lxxxiv. note.\r\n\r\n[490] The main street of Achradina is spoken of by Cicero as broad,\r\nstraight and long; which was unusual in an ancient Greek city. See\r\nGrote. ad. loc.\r\n\r\n[491] The citadel of Syracuse was built upon the island of Ortygia, and\r\nwas therefore easily cut off by a ditch and palisade across the narrow\r\nisthmus by which it was connected with the mainland.\r\n\r\n[492] \"He offered them what in modern times would be called a\r\nconstitution.\" Grote.\r\n\r\n[493] On this passage Grote has the following note:--\"Plutarch states\r\nthat Herakleides brought only seven triremes. But the force stated by\r\nDiodorus (twenty triremes, three transports and 1500 soldiers) appears\r\nmore probable. It is difficult otherwise to explain the number of ships\r\nwhich the Syracusans presently appear as possessing. Moreover, the great\r\nimportance which Herakleides steps into, as opposed to Dion, is more\r\neasily accounted for.\"\r\n\r\n[494] The Syracusan cavalry was celebrated, and \"the knights\" here and\r\nelsewhere no doubt means Syracusan citizens, though at first this\r\npassage looks as if strangers were meant. See ch. 44, where the knights\r\nand leading citizens are mentioned together.\r\n\r\n[495] I conceive that the \"atrium\" or \"cavædium\" of the house, that is,\r\nthe interior peristyle or court surrounded with columns, is meant, and\r\nthat Dion, sitting on one side of this room, saw the apparition behind\r\nthe columns on the other. An outside portico was a very unusual\r\nappendage to a Greek house, and Dion's house is said to have been\r\nespecially simple and unpretending, whereas nearly all houses were built\r\nwith an inner court or \"patio,\" with its roof supported by columns, and\r\ninto which the other rooms of the house opened.\r\n\r\n[496] L. Junius Brutus, consul B.C. 509, was a Patrician, and his race\r\nwas extinct in his two sons (Liv. ii. 1-4; Drumann, _Junii_, p. 1; Dion\r\nCassius, xliv. 12; Dionys. Hal. _Antiq. Rom._ v. 18).\r\n\r\n[497] Servilia, the wife of M. Junius Brutus, the father of this Brutus,\r\nwas the daughter of Livia, who was the sister of M. Livius Drusus,\r\ntribunus plebis B.C. 91. Livia married for her first husband M. Cato, by\r\nwhom she had M. Cato Uticensis; for her second husband she had Q.\r\nServilius Cæpio, by whom she became the mother of Servilia. M. Junius\r\nBrutus, the father of this Brutus, was the first husband of Servilia,\r\nwho had by her second husband, D. Junius Silanus, two daughters. Her son\r\nBrutus was born in the autumn of B.C. 85. He was adopted by his uncle Q.\r\nServilius Cæpio, whence he is sometimes called Cæpio, and Q. Cæpio\r\nBrutus on coins, public monuments, and in decrees (Drumann, _Junii_).\r\n\r\n[498] Ahala was Magister Equitum to L. Quinctius Cincinnatus. The story\r\nbelongs to B.C. 439; and it is told by Livius, iv. 13, 14. The true name\r\nof Mallius Spurius is Spurius Mælius.\r\n\r\n[499] This passage is obscure in the original. The parentage of M.\r\nJunius Brutus, the father of this Brutus, does not appear to be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n[500] See the Life of Lucullus, c. 42.\r\n\r\n[501] See the Life of Cicero, c. 4. Cicero mentions Ariston, which is\r\nprobably the true name, in his Tusculanæ Quæstiones, v. 8.\r\n\r\n[502] Nothing more is known of him.\r\n\r\n[503] The original is obscure. See Sintenis, note; and Schæfer, note.\r\nKaltwasser follows the reading [Greek: pros tas exodous], which he\r\ntranslates \"für den Kriegsdienst.\"\r\n\r\n[504] See the Life of the Younger Cato, c. 35, &c.\r\n\r\n[505] Coræs explains the original ([Greek: scholastês]) to mean \"one who\r\nis engaged about learning and philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n[506] The father of this Brutus was of the faction of Marius, and\r\ntribunus plebis B.C. 83. After Sulla's return he lost all power, and\r\nafter Sulla's death Pompeius (B.C. 77) marched against Brutus, who shut\r\nhimself up in Mutina (Modena). A mutiny among his troops compelled him\r\nto open the gates, and Pompeius ordered him to be put to death, contrary\r\nto the promise which he had given (Life of Pompeius, c. 16).\r\n\r\nThe allusion at the beginning of this chapter is to the outbreak between\r\nPompeius and Cæsar, B.C. 49.\r\n\r\n[507] P. Sextius was governor of Cilicia. In the text of Plutarch\r\nSicilia stands erroneously in place of Cilicia: this is probably an\r\nerror of the copyists, who often confound these names (see Life of\r\nPompeius, c. 61; Cicero, _Ad Attic._ viii. 14; ix. 7).\r\n\r\n[508] Brutus was a great reader and a busy writer. Drumann (_Junii_, p.\r\n37) gives a sketch of his literary activity. Such a trifle as an epitome\r\nof Polybius was probably only intended as a mere occupation to pass the\r\ntime. The loss of it is not a matter of regret, any further than so far\r\nas it might have supplied some deficiencies in the present text of\r\nPolybius. Bacon (Advancement of Learning) describes epitomes thus: \"As\r\nfor the corruptions and moths of history, which are epitomes, the use of\r\nthem deserveth to be banished, as all men of sound judgment have\r\nconfessed; as those that have fretted and corroded the sound bodies of\r\nmany excellent histories, and wrought them into base and unprofitable\r\ndregs.\"\r\n\r\n[509] The story of Cæsar receiving this note is told in the Life of\r\nCato, c. 24. Cæsar was born on the 12th July, B.C. 100, which is a\r\nsufficient answer to the scandalous tale of his being the father of\r\nBrutus. That he may have had an adulterous commerce with Servilia in and\r\nbefore B.C. 63, the year of Catiline's conspiracy, is probable enough.\r\n\r\n[510] This was C. Cassius Longinus, who accompanied Crassus in his\r\nParthian campaign (Life of Crassus, c. 18, &c.). After Cato had retired\r\nto Africa, Cassius made his peace with Cæsar (Dion Cassius, xlii. 13).\r\n\r\n[511] Kaltwasser has adopted the correction of Moses du Soul, and has\r\ntranslated the passage \"in Nikaea für den König Deiotarus.\" The anecdote\r\nappears to refer clearly to king Deiotarus, as appears from Cicero's\r\nLetters to Atticus (xiv. 1). See Drumann's note, _Junii_, p. 25, note\r\n83. Coræs would read [Greek: Galatôn] for [Greek: Libyôn].\r\n\r\n[512] This was the north part of Italy. Cæsar set out for his African\r\ncampaign in B.C. 47. Brutus held Gallia in the year B.C. 46. See\r\nDrumann, _Junii_, p. 26, note 91, on the administration of Gallia by\r\nBrutus.\r\n\r\n[513] Plutarch here alludes to the office of Prætor Urbanus, who, during\r\nthe year of his office, was the chief person for the administration of\r\njustice. The number of prætors at this time was ten (Dion Cassius, xlii.\r\n51), to which number they were increased from eight by Cæsar in B.C. 47.\r\nThe Prætor Urbanus still held the first rank. The motive of Cæsar may\r\nhave been, as Dion Cassius says, to oblige his dependents by giving them\r\noffice and rank. Brutus was Prætor Urbanus in B.C. 44, the year of\r\nCæsar's assassination.\r\n\r\n[514] This anecdote is told in Cæsar's Life, c. 62.\r\n\r\n[515] Q. Fufius Calenus was sent by Cæsar before the battle of Pharsalus\r\nto Greece (Life of Cæsar, c. 43). Megara made strong resistance to\r\nCalenus, and was treated with severity. Dion Cassius (xlii. 14) says\r\nnothing about the lions.\r\n\r\n[516] See the Life of Sulla, c. 34, and note to c. 37; and the Life of\r\nCæsar, c. 53, note.\r\n\r\n[517] See the Life of Cæsar, c. 61, and Dion Cassius, xliv. 3, &c.\r\n\r\n[518] His name was Quintus. Ligarius fought against Cæsar at the battle\r\nof Thapsus B.C. 46. He was taken prisoner and banished. He was\r\nprosecuted by Q. Delius Tubero for his conduct in Africa, and defended\r\nby Cicero in an extant speech. Ligarius obtained a pardon from Cæsar,\r\nand he repaid the dictator, like many others, by aiding in his murder.\r\nIt seems pretty certain that he lost his life in the proscriptions of\r\nthe Triumviri (Appian, _Civil Wars_, iv, 22, 23).\r\n\r\n[519] Compare the Life of the Younger Cato, c. 65, 73; and as to\r\nFavonius, the same life.\r\n\r\n[520] Q. Antistius Labeo was one of the hearers of Servius Sulpicius\r\n(Dig. i. tit. 2, s. 2, § 44), and himself a jurist, and the father of a\r\nmore distinguished jurist, Antistius Labeo, who lived under Augustus. He\r\nwas at the battle of Philippi, and after the defeat he killed himself,\r\nand was buried in a grave in his tent, which he had dug for the purpose\r\n(Appian, _Civil Wars_, iv. 135).\r\n\r\n[521] See the Life of Cæsar, c. 64, and the note.\r\n\r\nThe signs of Cæsar's death are mentioned in the Life of Cæsar, c. 63.\r\n\r\n[522] Brutus was first married to Claudia, a daughter of Appius\r\nClaudius, consul B.C. 54. It was probably in B.C. 55, and after Cato's\r\ndeath, that he put away Claudia, for which he was blamed (Cic. _Ad\r\nAttic._ xiii. 9), and married Porcia, the daughter of Cato, and widow of\r\nM. Calpurnius Bibulus, the colleague of Cæsar in the consulship B.C. 59.\r\nAs to the affair of the wound, compare Dion Cassius (xliv. 13 &c.).\r\n\r\n[523] This was the great architectural work of Pompeius (Life of\r\nPompeius, c. 40, note).\r\n\r\n[524] The same story is told by Appian (_Civil Wars_, ii. 115).\r\n\r\n[525] The circumstances of Cæsar's death are told in his Life, c. 66;\r\nwhere it is incorrectly said that Brutus Albinus engaged Antonius in\r\nconversation. To the authorities referred to in the note to c. 66 of the\r\nLife of Cæsar, add Cicero, _Philipp._ ii. 14, which is referred to by\r\nKaltwasser.\r\n\r\n[526] L. Munatius Plancus, who had received favours from Cæsar, and the\r\nprovince of Transalpine Gaul, with the exception of Narbonensis and\r\nBelgica B.C. 44.\r\n\r\nAs to the arrangement about the provinces after Cæsar's death, see the\r\nLife of Antonius, c. 14.\r\n\r\n[527] Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 68, and the note.\r\n\r\n[528] The allusion is to P. Clodius, who fell in a brawl with T. Annius\r\nMilo B.C. 52. See the Life of Cicero, c. 52.\r\n\r\n[529] Compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 68.\r\n\r\n[530] Now Porto d'Anzo, on the coast of Latium, thirty miles from Rome.\r\nIt is now a poor place, with numerous remains of former buildings\r\n(Westphal, _Die Römische Kampagne_, and his two maps).\r\n\r\n[531] These were the Ludi Apollinares (Dion, xlvii. 20), which Brutus\r\nhad to superintend as Prætor Urbanus. The day of celebration was the\r\nfourth of Quintilis or Julius. The games were superintended by L.\r\nAntonius, the brother of Marcus, and the colleague of Brutus.\r\n\r\n[532] Compare the Life of Cicero, c. 43, and notes; and the Life of\r\nAntonius, c. 16.\r\n\r\n[533] Complaints like these, of the conduct of Cicero, appear in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth letters of the book which is entitled 'M.\r\nTullii Epistolarum ad Brutum Liber Singularis;' but the genuineness of\r\nthese letters is very doubtful. Plutarch himself (_Brutus_, 53) did not\r\nfully believe in the genuineness of all the letters attributed to\r\nBrutus.\r\n\r\n[534] Elea, the Romans called this place Velia. It was on the coast of\r\nLucania, in the modern province of Basilicata in the kingdom of Naples;\r\nand the remains are near Castella a mare della Brucca. Velia is often\r\nmentioned by Cicero, who set sail from thence when he intended to go to\r\nGreece (Life of Cicero, c. 43).\r\n\r\n[535] The passages in Homer are, _Iliad_, vi. 429 and 491, the parting\r\nof Hector and Andromache. The old stories of Greece furnished the\r\npainter with excellent subjects, and the simplicity with which they\r\ntreated them may be inferred from Plutarch's description. The poet was\r\nhere the real painter. The artist merely gave a sensuous form to the\r\npoet's conception. The parting of Hector and Andromache is the subject\r\nof one of Schiller's early poems.\r\n\r\n[536] Dion Cassius (xlvii. 20) describes the reception of Brutus at\r\nAthens. The Athenians ordered bronze statues of Brutus and Cassius to be\r\nset up by the side of the statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who had\r\nliberated Athens from the tyranny of the Peisistratidæ.\r\n\r\n[537] See the Life of Pompeius, c. 75. Cicero's son Marcus was attending\r\nthe lectures of Cratippus B.C. 44, and also, as it appears, up to the\r\ntime when Brutus came to Athens. Horace, who was now at Athens, also\r\njoined the side of Brutus, and was present at the battle of Philippi.\r\n\r\n[538] A town near the southern point of Euboea. The Roman commander who\r\ngave up the money, was the Quæstor M. Appuleius (Cicero, _Philipp._ x.\r\n11). Plutarch in the next chapter calls him Antistius.\r\n\r\n[539] These are the dying words of Patroclus (_Iliad_, xvi. 849). Apollo\r\nis Leto's son.\r\n\r\n[540] See the Life of Cicero, c. 43, note; and Dion Cassius (xlvii. 29,\r\n&c.).\r\n\r\n[541] A town in Thessalia.\r\n\r\n[542] Q. Hortensius Hortalus, the son of the orator Hortensius, who held\r\nthe province of Macedonia (B.C. 44), in which Brutus was to succeed him.\r\nHe was put to death by M. Antonius after the battle of Philippi (c. 28).\r\n\r\n[543] This may be an error of Plutarch's copyists. His name was P.\r\nVatinius (Dion Cassius, xlvii. 21).\r\n\r\n[544] The Greek soldiers suffered in this way in their retreat from\r\nBabylonia over the table-land of Armenia (Xenophon, _Anabasis_, iv. 5,\r\n7). This bulimy is a different thing from that which modern writers call\r\nby that name, and which they describe as a \"canine appetite, insatiable\r\ndesire for food.\" The nature of the appetite is exemplified by the\r\ninstance of a man eating in one day four pounds of raw cow's udder, ten\r\npounds of raw beef, two pounds of candles, and drinking five bottles of\r\nporter (Penny Cyclopædia, art. Bulimia). The subject of Bulimia is\r\ndiscussed by Plutarch (_Symposiaca_, b. vi. Qu. 8).\r\n\r\n[545] Now Butrinto, was on the main land in the north part of the\r\nchannel which divides Corcyra (Corfu) from the continent. It was made a\r\nColonia by the Romans after their occupation of Epirus. Atticus, the\r\nfriend of Cicero, had land in the neighbourhood of Buthrotum.\r\n\r\nAs to the events mentioned at the end of this chapter, compare Dion\r\nCassius, xlvii. 21-23.\r\n\r\n[546] Compare Dion Cassius, xlvii. 22.\r\n\r\n[547] This was Decimus Brutus Albinus, who fell into the hands of the\r\nsoldiers of M. Antonius in North Italy, and was put to death by order of\r\nAntonius B.C. 43. Compare Dion Cassius (xlvi. 53), and the note of\r\nReimarus.\r\n\r\n[548] Brutus passed over into Asia probably about the middle of B.C. 43,\r\nwhile the proscriptions were going on at Rome. As to Cyzicus, see the\r\nLife of Lucullus, c. 9.\r\n\r\n[549] Cassius was now in Syria, whence he designed to march to Egypt to\r\npunish Cleopatra for the assistance which she had given to Dolabella.\r\n\r\n[550] The Mediterranean, for which the Romans had no name.\r\n\r\n[551] Xanthus stood on a river of the same name, about ten miles from\r\nthe mouth. The river is now called Etchen-Chai. Xanthus is first\r\nmentioned by Herodotus (i. 176), who describes its destruction by the\r\nPersian general Harpagus, to which Plutarch afterwards (c. 31) alludes.\r\nNumerous remains have been recently discovered there by Fellowes, and\r\nsome of them are now in the British Museum (Penny Cyclop. art. Xanthian\r\nMarbles, and the references in that article).\r\n\r\nThe last sentence of this chapter is very confused in the original.\r\n\r\n[552] Compare the Life of Pompeius, c. 77, 80.\r\n\r\n[553] Brutus and Cassius met at Sardis in the early part of B.C. 42.\r\n\r\n[554] The passage to which Plutarch refers is _Iliad_, i. 259. The\r\ncharacter of Favonius is well known from the Lives of Pompeius and Cato\r\nthe Younger.\r\n\r\n[555] Kaltwasser has a note on the Roman practice of an invited guest\r\ntaking his shadows (umbræ) with him. Horace alludes to the practice (i.\r\nEp. 5, 28),\r\n\r\n   ----\"locus est et pluribus umbris.\"\r\n\r\nPlutarch discusses the etiquette as to umbræ in his Symposiaca (book\r\nvii. Qu. 6).\r\n\r\n[556] The Romans reclined at table. They placed couches on three sides\r\nof the table and left the fourth open. The central couch or sofa (lectus\r\nmedius) was the first place. The other sofas at the adjoining two sides\r\nwere respectively lectus summus and imus.\r\n\r\n[557] Nothing further seems to be known of him. The name Pella is\r\nprobably corrupt. The consequence of his condemnation was Infamia, as to\r\nthe meaning of which term: see Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities,\r\nInfamia. This interview between Brutus and Cassius forms one of the\r\nfinest scenes in Shakespeare's play of Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[558] The reading here is probably corrupt. See the note of Sintenis.\r\n\r\n[559] The ghost story is told also in the Life of Cæsar, c. 69.\r\n\r\n[560] Cassius was one of the Romans who had embraced the doctrines of\r\nEpicurus, modified somewhat by the Roman character. Cicero in a letter\r\nto Cassius (_Ad Diversos_, xv. 16) rallies him about his opinions; and\r\nCassius (xv. 19) in reply defends them. Cicero says to Cassius, that he\r\nhopes he will tell him whether it is in his power, as soon as he chooses\r\nto think of Cassius, to have his spectrum ([Greek: eidôlon]) present,\r\nbefore him, and whether, if he should begin to think of the island\r\nBritannia, the image (spectrum) of Britannia will fly to his mind.\r\n\r\nLucretius expounded the Epicurean doctrines in his poem De Rerum Natura.\r\nIn his fourth book he treats of images (simulacra):\r\n\r\n   \"Quæritur in primis quare quod quoique libido\r\n    Venerit, extemplo mens cogitet ejus id ipsum.\r\n    Anne voluntatem nostram simulacra tuentur,\r\n    Et simulac volumus, nobis occurrit imago?\"--iv. 781, &c.\r\n\r\nThe things on which the mind has been engaged in waking hours, recur as\r\nimages during sleep:\r\n\r\n   \"Et quo quisque fere studio defunctus adhæret,\r\n    Aut quibus in rebus multum sumus ante moratei\r\n    Atque in ea ratione fuit contenta magis mens,\r\n    In somnis eadem plerumque videmur obire:\r\n    Causidicei causas agere et componere leges,\r\n    Induperatores pugnare ac proelia obire,\" &c.--iv. 963.\r\n\r\nHe has observed in a previous passage, that numerous images of things\r\nwander about in all directions, that they are of a subtile nature, and\r\nare easily united when they meet; they are of a much more subtile nature\r\nthan the things which affect the sight, for they penetrate through the\r\npores of bodies, and inwardly move the subtile nature of the mind. He\r\nthen adds:\r\n\r\n   \"Centauros itaque et Scyllarum membra videmus,\r\n    Cerbereasque canum fauceis simulacraque eorum\r\n    Quorum morte obita tellus amplectitur ossa.\"--iv. 734, &c.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine which Lucretius inculcated as to the deities, admitted\r\ntheir existence, but denied that they concerned themselves about mundane\r\naffairs; and they had nothing to do with the creation of the world. It\r\nis one of the main purposes of the poem to free men from all religious\r\nbelief, and to show the misery and absurdities that it breeds.\r\n\r\nA belief in dæmons would be inconsistent with such doctrines; and as to\r\nthe gods, Cassius means to say, that though he did not believe in their\r\nexistence, he almost wished that there were gods to aid their righteous\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nAs to the opinions of Cassius, compare the Life of Cæsar, c. 66.\r\n\r\n[561] C. Norbanus Flaccus and L. Decidius Saxa, two legates of Antonius,\r\nwho had been sent forward with eight legions, and had occupied Philippi.\r\nThe town of Philippi lay near the mountain-range of Pangæus and\r\nSymbolum, which was the name of a place at which Pangæus joins another\r\nmountain, that stretches up into the interior. Symbolum was between\r\nNeapolis (new city) and Philippi. Neapolis was on the coast opposite to\r\nThasus: Philippi was in the mountain region, and was built on a hill;\r\nwest of it was a plain which extended to the Strymon (Appian, _Civil\r\nWars_, iv. 1205; Dion Cassius. xlvii. 35). Philippi was originally\r\ncalled Krenides, or the Springs, then Datus, and lastly Philippi by King\r\nPhilippus, of Macedonia, who fortified it. Appian's description of the\r\nposition of Philippi is very clear.\r\n\r\n[562] A lustration was a solemn ceremony of purification, which was\r\nperformed on various occasions, and before a battle: see Livy, xxix. 47.\r\n\r\nThe omens which preceded the battle are recorded by Dion Cassius, xlvii.\r\n49.\r\n\r\n[563] M. Valerius Messala Corvinus, of a distinguished Roman family, was\r\na son of Messala who was consul B.C. 53. After the battle of Philippi he\r\nattached himself to M. Antonius, whom he deserted to join Octavianus\r\nCæsar. He fought on Cæsar's side at the battle of Actium (c. 53). He\r\ndied somewhere between B.C. 3 and A.D. 3. Messala was a poet and an\r\nhistorian. His history of the Civil Wars, after the death of the\r\nDictator Cæsar, was used by Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[564] See the note of Sintenis, who proposes to read [Greek: keklêmenos]\r\nfor [Greek: keklêmenon], to prevent any ambiguity, such as Kaltwasser\r\ndiscovered in the passage. It was the birthday of Cassius (Appian,\r\n_Civil Wars_, iv, 113).\r\n\r\n[565] Plutarch here quotes the Memoirs of Cæsar. It is of no great\r\nimportance who saw the dream, and perhaps there was no dream at all.\r\nCæsar wished to have an excuse for being out of the way of danger. Dion\r\nCassius (xlvii. 41) says that it was Cæsar's physician who had the\r\ndream, but he does not mention his name. See the notes of Reimarus.\r\n\r\n[566] The true name may be Briges. The Briges were a Thracian tribe\r\n(Stephan. Byzant., [Greek: Briges]), who are mentioned by Herodotus\r\n(vii. 73). The Macedonian tradition was that they were the same as the\r\nPhrygians; that so long as they lived in Europe with the Macedonians\r\nthey kept the name of Briges, and that when they passed over into Asia\r\nthey were called Phryges.\r\n\r\n[567] Drumann (_Geschichte Roms_, i. 516, n. 84) assumes that it is P.\r\nVolumnius Eutrapelus, a boon companion of Antonius. Several of Cicero's\r\nletters to him are extant (_Ad Div._ vii. 32, 33).\r\n\r\n[568] Plutarch has handled the character of Brutus with partiality. He\r\ncould not be ignorant of his love of money and of the oppressive manner\r\nin which he treated his unlucky creditors. Drumann (_Junii_, p. 20, &c.)\r\nhas collected the evidence on this point. Though Brutus was an austere\r\nman and affected philosophy, his character is not free from the\r\nimputation of ingratitude to Cæsar, love of power, and avarice. He seems\r\nto have been one of those who deceive themselves into a belief of their\r\nown virtues, because they are free from other people's vices. The\r\npromise of plunder to his soldiers is not excusable because Antonius and\r\nCæsar did worse than he intended to do. Plutarch here alludes to many of\r\nthe Italians being driven out of their lands, which were given to the\r\nsoldiers who had fought on the side of Cæsar and Antonius at Philippi.\r\nThe misery that was occasioned by this measure was one of the chief\r\nevils of the Civil Wars. The slaughter in war chiefly affected the\r\nsoldiers themselves, and if both armies had been destroyed, the people\r\nwould only have been the better for it. The misery that arose from the\r\nejection of the hard-working husbandmen reached to their wives and\r\nchildren. But a country which had a large army on foot which is no\r\nlonger wanted, must either pay them out of taxes and plunder, or have a\r\nrevolution. Necessity was the excuse for Cæsar and Antonius, and the\r\nsame necessity would have been the excuse of Brutus, if he had been\r\nvictorious. Defeat saved him from this necessity.\r\n\r\n[569] The ships which were bringing aid to Cæsar from Brundusium under\r\nthe command of Domitius Calvinus. They were met and defeated by L.\r\nStatius Marcus.\r\n\r\n[570] Nothing seems to be known about him. Of course he is not the\r\nVolumnius mentioned in c. 45.\r\n\r\n[571] See the Life of Cato the Younger, c. 73.\r\n\r\n[572] See the Life of Antonius, c. 70.\r\n\r\n[573] The verse is from the Medea of Euripides (v. 332), in which Medea\r\nIs cursing her faithless husband Jason. The educated Romans were\r\nfamiliar with the Greek dramatists, whom they often quoted. (Compare the\r\nLife of Pompeius, c. 78.) Appian says that Brutus intended to apply this\r\nline to Antonius (_Civil Wars_, iv. 130).\r\n\r\nThe other verse, which Volumnius forgot, was remembered by somebody\r\nelse, if it be the verse of which Florus (iv. 7) has recorded the\r\nsubstance, \"that virtue is not a reality, but a name.\" Dion Cassius\r\n(xlvii. 49, and the note of Reimarus) also has recorded two Greek verses\r\nwhich Brutus is said to have uttered; but he does not mention the verse\r\nwhich Plutarch cites. The substance of the two verses cited by Dion is\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n   \"Poor virtue, empty name, whom I have serv'd\r\n    As a true mistress; thou art fortune's slave.\"\r\n\r\nVolumnius might not choose to remember these verses, as Drumann\r\nsuggests, in order to save the credit of his friend.\r\n\r\n[574] See c. 11, and the Life of the younger Cato, c. 65, 73.\r\n\r\n[575] Brutus was forty-three years of age when he died. Velleius (ii.\r\n72) says that he was in his thirty-seventh year, which is a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe character of Brutus requires a special notice. It is easy enough to\r\nwrite a character of a man, but not easy to write a true one. Michelet\r\n(_Histoire de la Revolution Française_, ii. 545), speaking of the chief\r\nactors of the revolution in 1789. '90, '91, says: \"We have rarely given\r\na judgment entire, indistinct, no _portrait_ properly speaking; all,\r\nalmost all, are unjust; resulting from a mean which is taken between\r\nthis and that moment in a person's life, between the good and the bad,\r\nneutralising the one by the other, and making both false. We have judged\r\nthe acts, as they present themselves, day by day, hour by hour. We have\r\ngiven a date to our judgments; and this has allowed us often to praise\r\nmen, whom at a later time we shall have to blame. Criticism, forgetful\r\nand harsh, too often condemns beginnings which are laudable, having in\r\nview the end which it knows, of which it has a view beforehand. But we\r\ndo not choose to know this end; whatever this man may do to-morrow, we\r\nnote for his advantage the good which he does to-day: the end will come\r\nsoon enough.\" This is the true method of writing history; this is the\r\ntrue method of judging men. Unfortunately we cannot trace the career of\r\nmany individuals with that particularity of date and circumstance which\r\nwould enable us to do justice. Plutarch does not draw characters in the\r\nmass in the modern way: he gives us both the good and the bad, in\r\ndetail: but with little regard sometimes to time and circumstance. He\r\nhas treated Brutus with partiality: he finds only one act in his life to\r\ncondemn (chap. 46). The great condemnation of Brutus is, that acting in\r\nthe name of virtue, he did not know what it was; that fighting for his\r\ncountry, he was fighting for a party; his Roman republic was a republic\r\nof aristocrats; his people was a fraction of the Roman citizens; he\r\nconceived no scheme for regenerating a whole nation: he engaged in a\r\ndeath struggle in which we can feel no sympathy. His name is an idle\r\nabused theme for rhetoric; and his portrait must be drawn, ill or well,\r\nthat the world may be disabused.\r\n\r\nDrumann (_Geschichte Roms_, Junii, p. 34) has carefully collected the\r\nacts of Brutus; and he has judged him severely, and, I think, truly.\r\n\r\nBrutus had moderate abilities, with great industry and much learning: he\r\nhad no merit as a general, but he had the courage of a soldier, he had\r\nthe reputation of virtue, and he was free from many of the vices of his\r\ncontemporaries; he was sober and temperate. Of enlarged political views\r\nhe had none; there is not a sign of his being superior in this respect\r\nto the mass of his contemporaries. When the Civil War broke out, he\r\njoined Pompeius, though Pompeius had murdered his father. If he gave up\r\nhis private enmity, as Plutarch says, for what he believed to be the\r\nbetter cause, the sacrifice was honourable: if there were other motives,\r\nand I believe there were, his choice of his party does him no credit.\r\nHis conspiracy against Cæsar can only be justified by those, if there\r\nare such, who think that a usurper ought to be got rid of in any way.\r\nBut if a man is to be murdered, one does not expect those to take a part\r\nin the act who, after being enemies have received favours from him, and\r\nprofessed to be friends. The murderers should at least be a man's\r\ndeclared enemies who have just wrongs to avenge. Though Brutus was\r\ndissatisfied with things under Cæsar, he was not the first mover in the\r\nconspiracy. He was worked upon by others, who knew that his character\r\nand personal relation to Cæsar would in a measure sanctify the deed; and\r\nby their persuasion, not his own resolve, he became an assassin in the\r\nname of freedom, which meant the triumph of his party, and in the name\r\nof virtue, which meant nothing.\r\n\r\nThe act was bad in Brutus as an act of treachery; and it was bad as an\r\nact of policy. It failed in its object--the success of a party, because\r\nthe death of Cæsar was not enough; other victims were necessary, and\r\nBrutus would not have them. He put himself at the head of a plot, in\r\nwhich there was no plan: he dreamed of success and forgot the means. He\r\nmistook the circumstances of the times and the character of the men. His\r\nconduct after the murder was feeble and uncertain; and it was also as\r\nillegal as the usurpation of Cæsar. \"He left Rome as prætor without the\r\npermission of the Senate; he took possession of a province which, even\r\naccording to Cicero's testimony, had been assigned to another; he\r\narbitrarily passed beyond the boundaries of his province, and set his\r\neffigy on the coins.\" (Drumann.) He attacked the Bessi in order to give\r\nhis soldiers booty, and he plundered Asia to get money for the conflict\r\nagainst Cæsar and Antonius, for the mastery of Rome and Italy. The means\r\nthat he had at his disposal show that he robbed without measure and\r\nwithout mercy; and never was greater tyranny exercised over helpless\r\npeople in the name of liberty than the wretched inhabitants of Asia\r\nexperienced from Brutus the \"Liberator\" and Cassius \"the last of the\r\nRomans.\" But all these great resources were thrown away in an\r\nill-conceived and worse executed campaign.\r\n\r\nTemperance, industry, and unwillingness to shed blood are noble\r\nqualities in a citizen and a soldier; and Brutus possessed them. But\r\ngreat wealth gotten by ill means is an eternal reproach; and the trade\r\nof money-lending, carried on in the names of others, with unrelenting\r\ngreediness, is both avarice and hypocrisy. Cicero, the friend of Brutus,\r\nis the witness for his wealth, and for his unworthy means to increase\r\nit.\r\n\r\nReflecting men in all ages have a philosophy. With the educated Greeks\r\nand Romans, philosophy was religion. The vulgar belief, under whatever\r\nname it may be, is never the belief of those who have leisure for\r\nreflection. The vulgar rich and vulgar poor are immersed in sense: the\r\nman of reflection strives to emerge from it. To him the things which are\r\nseen are only the shadows of the unseen; forms without substance, but\r\nthe evidence of the substantial: \"for the invisible things of God from\r\nthe creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the\r\nthings that are made\" (Epistle to the Romans, i. 20). Brutus was from\r\nhis youth up a student of philosophy and well versed in the systems of\r\nthe Greeks. Untiring industry and a strong memory had stored his mind\r\nwith the thoughts of others, but he had not capacity enough to draw\r\nprofit from his intellectual as he did from his golden treasures. His\r\nmind was a barren field on which no culture could raise an abundant\r\ncrop. His wisdom was the thoughts of others, and he had ever ready in\r\nhis mouth something that others had said. But to utter other men's\r\nwisdom is not enough: a man must make it his own by the labour of\r\nindependent thought. Philosophy and superstition were blended in his\r\nmind, and they formed a chaos in his bewildered brain, as they always\r\nwill do; and the product is Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire. In the\r\nstill of night phantoms floated before his wasted strength and wakeful\r\neyes; perhaps the vision of him, the generous and the brave, who had\r\nsaved the life of an enemy in battle, and fell by his hand in the midst\r\nof peace. Conscience was his tormentor, for truth was stronger than the\r\nillusions of self-imputed virtue. Though Brutus had condemned Cato's\r\ndeath, he died by his own hand, not with the stubborn resolve of Cato,\r\nwho would not yield to a usurper, but merely to escape from his enemies.\r\nA Roman might be pardoned for not choosing to become the prisoner of a\r\nRoman, but his grave should have been the battlefield, and the\r\ninstrument should have been the hands of those who were fighting against\r\nthe cause which he proclaimed to be righteous and just. Cato's son\r\nbettered his father's example: he died on the plain of Philippi by the\r\nsword of the enemy. Brutus died without belief in the existence of that\r\nvirtue which he had affected to follow: the triumph of a wrongful cause,\r\nas he conceived it, was a proof that virtue was an empty name. He forgot\r\nthe transitory nature of all individual existences, and thought that\r\njustice perished with him. But a true philosopher does not make himself\r\na central point, nor his own misfortunes a final catastrophe. He looks\r\nboth backwards and forwards, to the past and the future, and views\r\nhimself as a small link in the great chain of events which holds all\r\nthings together. Brutus died in despair, with the courage, but not with\r\nthe faith, of a martyr.\r\n\r\nWhen men talk of tyranny and rise against it, the name of Brutus is\r\ninvoked; a mere name and nothing else. What single act is there in the\r\nman's life which promised the regeneration of his country and the\r\nfreedom of mankind? Like other Romans, he only thought of maintaining\r\nthe supremacy of Rome; his ideas were no larger than theirs; he had no\r\nsympathy for those whom Rome governed and oppressed. For his country, he\r\nhad nothing to propose; its worn-out political constitution he would\r\nmaintain, not amend; indeed, amendment was impossible. Probably he\r\ndreaded anarchy and the dissolution of social order, for that would have\r\nreleased his creditors and confiscated his valuable estates. But Cæsar's\r\nusurpation was not an anarchy: it was a monarchy, a sole rule; and\r\nBrutus, who was ambitious, could not endure that. It may be said that if\r\nthe political views of Brutus were narrow, he was only like most of his\r\ncountrymen. But why then is he exalted, and why is his name invoked?\r\nWhat single title had he to distinction except what Cæsar gave him? A\r\nman of unknown family, the son of a woman whom Cæsar had debauched,\r\npardoned after fighting against his mother's lover, raised by him to the\r\nprætorship, and honoured with Cæsar's friendship--he has owed his\r\ndistinction to nothing else than murdering the man whose genius he could\r\nnot appreciate, but whose favours he had enjoyed.\r\n\r\nHis spurious philosophy has helped to save him from the detestation\r\nwhich is his due; but the false garb should be stripped off. A stoic, an\r\nascetic, and nothing more, is a mere negation. The active virtues of\r\nBrutus are not recorded. If he sometimes did an act of public justice\r\n(c. 35), it was not more than many other Romans have done. To reduce\r\nthis philosopher to his true level, we ask, what did he say or do that\r\nshowed a sympathy with all mankind? Where is the evidence that he had\r\nthe feeling of justice which alone can regenerate a nation? But it may\r\nbe said, why seek in a Roman of his age what we cannot expect to find?\r\nWhy then elevate him above the rest of his age and consecrate his name?\r\nWhy make a hero of him who murdered his benefactor, and then ran away\r\nfrom the city which he was to save--from we know not what? And why make a\r\nvirtuous man of him who was only austere, and who did not believe in the\r\nvirtues that he professed? As to statesmanship, nobody has claimed that\r\nfor him yet.\r\n\r\n\"The deputy of Arras, poor, and despised even by his own party, won the\r\nconfidence of the people by their belief in his probity: and he deserved\r\nit. Fanatical and narrow-minded, he was still a man of principles.\r\nUntiring industry, unshaken faith, and poverty, the guarantee of his\r\nprobity, raised him slowly to distinction, and enabled him to destroy\r\nall who stood between him and the realisation of an unbending theory.\r\nThough he had sacrificed the lives of others, he scorned to save his own\r\nby doing what would have contradicted his principles: he respected the\r\nform of legality, when its substance no longer existed, and refused to\r\nsanction force when it would have been used for his own protection\"\r\n(Lamartine, _Histoire des Girondins_, liv. 61, ix.). A great and\r\nmemorable example of crime, of fanaticism, and of virtue; of a career\r\ncommenced in the cause of justice, in truth, faith and sincerity; of a\r\nman who did believe in virtue, and yet spoiled the cause in which he\r\nembarked, and left behind him a name for universal execration.\r\n\r\nTreachery at home, enmity abroad, and misconduct in its own leaders,\r\nmade the French Revolution result in anarchy, and then in a tyranny. The\r\nCivil Wars of Rome resulted in a monarchy, and there was nothing else in\r\nwhich they could end. The Roman monarchy or the Empire was a natural\r\nbirth. The French Empire was an abortion. The Roman Empire was the\r\nproper growth of the ages that had preceded it: they could produce\r\nnothing better. In a few years after the battle of Philippi, Cæsar\r\nOctavianus got rid of his partner Antonius; and under the administration\r\nof Augustus the world enjoyed comparative peace, and the Roman Empire\r\nwas established and consolidated. The genius of Augustus, often ill\r\nappreciated, is demonstrated by the results of his policy. He restored\r\norder to a distracted state and transmitted his power to his successors.\r\nThe huge fabric of Roman greatness resting on its ancient foundations,\r\nonly crumbled beneath the assaults that time and new circumstances make\r\nagainst all political institutions.\r\n\r\n[576] Velleius (ii. 71, quoted by Kaltwasser) states that some of the\r\npartisans of Brutus and Cassius wished Messala to put himself at the\r\nhead of their party, but he declined to try the fortune of another\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\n[577] Compare the Life of Antonius, c. 22. Appian (_Civil Wars_, iv.\r\n135) makes the same statement as Plutarch about the body of Brutus. It\r\nis not inconsistent with this that his head was cut off in order to be\r\nsent to Rome and thrown at the feet of Cæsar's statue, as Suetonius says\r\n(Sueton. _August._ 13). Dion Cassius adds (xlvii. 49) that in the\r\npassage from Dyrrachium a storm came on and the head was thrown into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[578] Nikolaus of Damascus, a Peripatetic philosopher, and a friend of\r\nAugustus, wrote a universal history in Greek, in one hundred and\r\nforty-four books, of which a few fragments remain. There is also a\r\nfragment of his Life of Augustus. The best edition is that of J.C.\r\nOrelli, Leipzig, 1804, 8vo.; to which a supplement was published in\r\n1811.\r\n\r\n[579] The work of Valerius Maximus is dedicated to the Emperor Tiberius.\r\nThe death of Porcia is mentioned in lib. iv. c. 6, 5. Appian (_Civil\r\nWars_, iv. 136) and Dion Cassius (xlvii. 49) give the same account of\r\nPorcia's death.\r\n\r\n[580] Plutarch here evidently doubts the genuineness of the letter\r\nattributed to Brutus. The life of Brutus offered good materials for the\r\nfalsifiers of history, who worked with them after rhetorical fashion.\r\nThere are a few letters in the collection of Cicero which are genuine,\r\nbut the single book of letters to Brutus (M. Tullii Ciceronis\r\nEpistolorum ad Brutum Liber Singularis) is condemned as a forgery by the\r\nbest critics. It contains letters of Cicero to Brutus, and of Brutus to\r\nCicero; and a letter of Brutus to Atticus. Genuine letters of Brutus,\r\nwritten day by day, like those of Cicero, would have formed the best\r\nmaterials from which we might judge him.\r\n\r\n[581] A despatch rolled in a peculiar manner.

Droysen suggests Andros; but\r\nThirlwall much more reasonably conjectures that the word should be\r\nHydrea, observing that the geographical position of Andros does not suit\r\nthe account given in the text. Clough prefers to read Andros, saying\r\nthat \"Aratus would hardly be thought to have gone from Hydrea to Euboea,\r\nwhich is near enough to Andros to make the supposition in this case not\r\nunnatural.\" But I think that this argument makes just the other way, for\r\nthe object of Aratus's slaves was to tell the Macedonian officer that\r\ntheir master was gone to a place so far away that it would be useless to\r\nattempt to follow him.\r\n\r\n[590] The word which I have here translated \"portraits\" generally means\r\nstatues, but not necessarily. Probably most of the despots were\r\ncommemorated by statues.\r\n\r\n[591] Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, I suppose is meant.\r\n\r\n[592] This Alexander was the son of Kraterus, and grandson of Alexander\r\nthe Great's general of that name.\r\n\r\n[593] A common precaution against surprise. See above, ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[594] This was Demetrius II., the son of Antigonus Gonatas, who\r\nsucceeded his father on the throne of Macedonia, B.C. 239.\r\n\r\n[595] Apparently the great seal of the league is meant, which we must\r\nsuppose was entrusted to the general for the time being.\r\n\r\n[596] I., ii. 607.\r\n\r\n[597] Philip's object in this expedition was to make himself master of\r\nApollonia and Oricum.\r\n\r\n[598] \"He was forced to burn his ships and retreat overland, leaving his\r\nbaggage, ammunition, and a great part of the arms of his troops in the\r\nenemy's hands.\" (_Thirlwall's History_, ch. lxiv).\r\n\r\n[599] See Merivale's 'History of the Romans under the Empire,' ch. liii.\r\nvol. vi. page 142, note.\r\n\r\n[600] Quintus Catulus Capitolinus.\r\n\r\n[601] Nero set a price upon the head of Vindex, whose designs were\r\nspeedily revealed to him, and though the forces of the Gaulish province\r\nwere disposed to follow their chief, the more powerful legions of Lower\r\nGermany, under Virginius Rufus, were in full march against them. The\r\narmies met at Vesontio, and there Virginius and Vindex at a private\r\ninterview agreed to conspire together, but their troops could come to no\r\nsuch understanding; the Virginians attacked the soldiers of Vindex, and\r\nalmost cut them to pieces. Vindex thereupon, with the haste and levity\r\nof his race, threw himself upon his sword, and the rebellion seemed for\r\na moment to be crushed. Merivale's 'History of the Romans under the\r\nEmpire,' vol. vi. ch. lv.\r\n\r\n[602] Nero died on the 9th of June, A.D. 68.\r\n\r\n[603] The gold ring was presented by the Roman emperors in much the same\r\nway as the insignia of an order of chivalry is given by modern\r\nsovereigns. Under the republic it had been the distinguishing mark of\r\nthe equestrian order, and its possession still continued to raise its\r\nrecipients to the rank of 'eques,' cf. Plin. H.N. 33, 2, and Paulus i.\r\n5, de jure anul.\r\n\r\n[604] Clough well remarks that here we may observe the beginning of a\r\nstate-post, which still exists on the continent of Europe, by which all\r\ngovernment couriers, &c., were forwarded free of expense. The modern\r\nterms of \"diplomacy,\" \"diplomatist,\" &c., is derived from the\r\n\"_diplomata_,\" or folded and sealed dispatches carried by such persons.\r\n\r\n[605] Narbonne.\r\n\r\n[606] Tacitus sums up the characters of these two men after his manner.\r\n\"Titus Vinius and Cornelius Laco, the one the worst, the other the\r\nlaziest of men, &c.\" Tac. Hist. i. 6.\r\n\r\n[607] No doubt Galba's personal appearance offered a striking contrast\r\nto that of \"the implacable, beautiful tyrant\" Nero. See infra, ch. 15,\r\nand Tac. Hist. i. 7\r\n\r\n[608] 'Tanquam innocentes,' Tac. Hist. i. 6.\r\n\r\n[609] More properly \"rowers,\" men employed to row in ships of war, who\r\nregarded it as promotion to become legionary soldiers.\r\n\r\n[610] Vinius had engaged to marry the daughter of Tigellinus, who was a\r\nwidow with a large dower.\r\n\r\n[611] 'Hordeonius Flaccus,' Tac. Hist. i. 12, 53, etc.\r\n\r\n[612] Tigellinus, we have learned from the last chapter but one, was\r\nliving at Rome. Moreover he was never in command of any legions; and\r\nevidently some legions in the provinces are meant. Clough conjectures\r\nthat we should read Vitellius instead of Tigellinus; and this I think\r\nvery reasonable.\r\n\r\n[613] This seems to be a mistake, as Asiaticus was a freedman of\r\nVitellius. See Tac. (_Hist._ ii. 57)\r\n\r\n[614] Of sesterces.\r\n\r\n[615] A.D. 69.\r\n\r\n[616] The First Legion, in Lower Germany.\r\n\r\n[617] At Cologne.\r\n\r\n[618] Tac. (_Hist._ i. 62).\r\n\r\n[619] Suetonius (_Otho_, 4) calls him Seleukus.\r\n\r\n[620] So I have ventured to translate \"speculator.\" The speculatores\r\nunder the empire were employed as special adjutants, messengers, and\r\nbodyguards of a general.\r\n\r\n[621] Counting inclusively in the Roman fashion.\r\n\r\n[622] The Miliarium Aureum, or Golden Milestone. London Stone was\r\nestablished by the Romans in Britain for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[623] This habit of the ancient Romans, of being carried about Rome in\r\nlitters, survives to the present day in the Pope's \"sedia gestatoria.\"\r\n\r\n[624] We learn from Tacitus that this man was the standard-bearer\r\n(vexillarius) of a cohort which still accompanied Galba. Tac. (_Hist._\r\ni. 41).\r\n\r\n[625] Galba before leaving the palace had put on a light, quilted tunic.\r\nSuet. (_Galba_, ch. 19).\r\n\r\n[626] She was obliged to pay for it. Tac. (_Hist._ i. 47).\r\n\r\n[627] Patrobius was a freedman of Nero who had been punished by Galba.\r\nThe words \"and Vitellius\" are probably corrupt.\r\n\r\n[628] Argius was Galba's house-steward. He buried his master's body in\r\nhis own private garden. Tac. (_Hist._ i. 49).\r\n\r\n[629] This life must be read as the sequel to that of Galba.\r\n\r\n[630] See Life of Galba, ch. viii., note.\r\n\r\n[631] Tac. (_Hist._ i. 80, 82, s. 99).\r\n\r\n[632] A body of troops, consisting of two centuriae (Polyb. ii. 23, 1),\r\nand consequently commanded by two centurions.\r\n\r\n[633] Tacitus (_Hist._ i. 83, 84) gives Otho's speech at length.\r\n\r\n[634] Almost literally translated by Plutarch from Tacitus (_Hist._ i.\r\n71)\r\n\r\n[635] Tac. (_Hist._ i. 86).\r\n\r\n[636] Caius Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[637] Tac. (_Hist._ i. 86).\r\n\r\n[638] These are more particularly described in Tac. (_Hist._ ii. 21).\r\n\r\n[639] I imagine that Cæcina made himself disliked by using signs instead\r\nof speaking, not that he had forgotten his language, but because he did\r\nnot choose to speak to the provincial magistrates. Tacitus (_Hist._ ii.\r\n20) says that he conducted himself modestly while in Italy.\r\n\r\n[640] We learn from Tacitus (_Hist._ ii. 20) that her name was Salonina.\r\nHe adds that she did no one any harm, but that people were offended with\r\nher because she rode upon a fine horse and dressed in scarlet.\r\n\r\n[641] \"At every place where he halted his devouring legions, and at\r\nevery place which he was induced to pass without halting, this rapacious\r\nchief required to be gratified with money, under threats of plunder and\r\nconflagration.\" Merivale (_History of the Romans_, ch. lvi.)\r\n\r\n[642] Tacitus (_Hist._ i. 87) describes Julius Proculus as active in the\r\ndischarge of his duties at Rome, but ignorant of real war. He was,\r\nTacitus adds, a knave and a villain, who got himself preferred before\r\nhonest men by the unscrupulous accusations which he brought against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[643] Tac. _Hist._ ii. 30.\r\n\r\n[644] Tacitus, (_Hist._ ii. 39) says that Otho was not present, but sent\r\nletters to the generals urging them to make haste. He adds that it is\r\nnot so easy to decide what ought to have been done as to condemn what\r\nwas actually done.\r\n\r\n[645] Tac. (_Hist._ ii. 37).\r\n\r\n[646] Tac. (_Hist._ ii. 43). The legions were the 21st \"Rapax,\" and the\r\n1st \"Adjutrix.\"\r\n\r\n[647] Their journey was, no doubt, back to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abantes, i.
