And then there was a white house with a green garden and an\r\norchard beyond, and mother said, \"Here we are!\"\r\n\r\n\"How white the house is,\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"And look at the roses,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"And the plums,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"It is rather decent,\" Cyril admitted.\r\n\r\nThe Baby said, \"Wanty go walky;\" and the hack stopped with a last rattle\r\nand jolt.\r\n\r\nEveryone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to\r\nget out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind.\r\nMother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out; and even when she\r\nhad come down slowly and by the step, and with no jump at all, she\r\nseemed to wish to see the boxes carried in, and even to pay the driver,\r\ninstead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and\r\norchard and the thorny, thistly, briery, brambly wilderness beyond the\r\nbroken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the\r\nchildren were wiser, for once. It was not really a pretty house at all;\r\nit was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient,\r\nand was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly\r\na cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the iron-work on the\r\nroof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was\r\ndeep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had\r\nbeen in London for two years, without so much as once going to the\r\nseaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House\r\nseemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.\r\nFor London is like prison for children, especially if their relations\r\nare not rich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: That first glorious rush round the garden]\r\n\r\nOf course there are the shops and theatres, and entertainments and\r\nthings, but if your people are rather poor you don't get taken to the\r\ntheatres, and you can't buy things out of the shops; and London has none\r\nof those nice things that children may play with without hurting the\r\nthings or themselves--such as trees and sand and woods and waters. And\r\nnearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape--all straight\r\nlines and flat streets, instead of being all sorts of odd shapes, like\r\nthings are in the country. Trees are all different, as you know, and I\r\nam sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two\r\nblades of grass exactly alike. But in streets, where the blades of grass\r\ndon't grow, everything is like everything else. This is why many\r\nchildren who live in the towns are so extremely naughty. They do not\r\nknow what is the matter with them, and no more do their fathers and\r\nmothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, tutors, governesses, and nurses; but I\r\nknow. And so do you, now. Children in the country are naughty sometimes,\r\ntoo, but that is for quite different reasons.\r\n\r\nThe children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly\r\nbefore they were caught and cleaned for tea, and they saw quite well\r\nthat they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so\r\nfrom the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered\r\nwith jasmine, all in white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the\r\nmost expensive perfume that is ever given for a birthday present; and\r\nwhen they had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and quite different\r\nfrom the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town; and when they found\r\nthe stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were\r\nalmost certain; and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled\r\nout of it and got a bump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had\r\nnipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep\r\nrabbits in, if you ever had any, they had no longer any doubts\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch]\r\n\r\nThe best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to\r\nplaces and not doing things. In London almost everything is labelled\r\n\"You mustn't touch,\" and though the label is invisible it's just as bad,\r\nbecause you know it's there, or if you don't you very soon get told.\r\n\r\nThe White House was on the edge of a hill, with a wood behind it--and\r\nthe chalk-quarry on one side and the gravel-pit on the other. Down at\r\nthe bottom of the hill was a level plain, with queer-shaped white\r\nbuildings where people burnt lime, and a big red brewery and other\r\nhouses; and when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting,\r\nthe valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist, and the\r\nlimekilns and hop-drying houses glimmered and glittered till they were\r\nlike an enchanted city out of the _Arabian Nights_.\r\n\r\nNow that I have begun to tell you about the place, I feel that I could\r\ngo on and make this into a most interesting story about all the\r\nordinary things that the children did,--just the kind of things you do\r\nyourself, you know, and you would believe every word of it; and when I\r\ntold about the children's being tiresome, as you are sometimes, your\r\naunts would perhaps write in the margin of the story with a pencil, \"How\r\ntrue!\" or \"How like life!\" and you would see it and would very likely be\r\nannoyed. So I will only tell you the really astonishing things that\r\nhappened, and you may leave the book about quite safely, for no aunts\r\nand uncles either are likely to write \"How true!\" on the edge of the\r\nstory. Grown-up people find it very difficult to believe really\r\nwonderful things, unless they have what they call proof. But children\r\nwill believe almost anything, and grown-ups know this. That is why they\r\ntell you that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see\r\nperfectly well that it is flat and lumpy; and why they say that the\r\nearth goes round the sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the\r\nsun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as\r\nit is, and the earth knows its place, and lies as still as a mouse. Yet\r\nI daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so\r\nyou will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and\r\nthe others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy. At\r\nleast they called it that, because that was what it called itself; and\r\nof course it knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever\r\nsaw or heard of or read about.\r\n\r\nIt was at the gravel-pits. Father had to go away suddenly on business,\r\nand mother had gone away to stay with Granny, who was not very well.\r\nThey both went in a great hurry, and when they were gone the house\r\nseemed dreadfully quiet and empty, and the children wandered from one\r\nroom to another and looked at the bits of paper and string on the floors\r\nleft over from the packing, and not yet cleared up, and wished they had\r\nsomething to do. It was Cyril who said--\r\n\r\n\"I say, let's take our spades and dig in the gravel-pits. We can pretend\r\nit's seaside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father says it was once,\" Anthea said; \"he says there are shells there\r\nthousands of years old.\"\r\n\r\nSo they went. Of course they had been to the edge of the gravel-pit and\r\nlooked over, but they had not gone down into it for fear father should\r\nsay they mustn't play there, and it was the same with the chalk-quarry.\r\nThe gravel-pit is not really dangerous if you don't try to climb down\r\nthe edges, but go the slow safe way round by the road, as if you were a\r\ncart.\r\n\r\nEach of the children carried its own spade, and took it in turns to\r\ncarry the Lamb. He was the baby, and they called him that because \"Baa\"\r\nwas the first thing he ever said. They called Anthea \"Panther,\" which\r\nseems silly when you read it, but when you say it it sounds a little\r\nlike her name.\r\n\r\nThe gravel-pit is very large and wide, with grass growing round the\r\nedges at the top, and dry stringy wildflowers, purple and yellow. It is\r\nlike a giant's washbowl. And there are mounds of gravel, and holes in\r\nthe sides of the bowl where gravel has been taken out, and high up in\r\nthe steep sides there are the little holes that are the little front\r\ndoors of the little bank-martins' little houses.\r\n\r\nThe children built a castle, of course, but castle-building is rather\r\npoor fun when you have no hope of the swishing tide ever coming in to\r\nfill up the moat and wash away the drawbridge, and, at the happy last,\r\nto wet everybody up to the waist at least.\r\n\r\nCyril wanted to dig out a cave to play smugglers in, but the others\r\nthought it might bury them alive, so it ended in all spades going to\r\nwork to dig a hole through the castle to Australia. These children, you\r\nsee, believed that the world was round, and that on the other side the\r\nlittle Australian boys and girls were really walking wrong way up, like\r\nflies on the ceiling, with their heads hanging down into the air.\r\n\r\nThe children dug and they dug and they dug, and their hands got sandy\r\nand hot and red, and their faces got damp and shiny. The Lamb had tried\r\nto eat the sand, and had cried so hard when he found that it was not,\r\nas he had supposed, brown sugar, that he was now tired out, and was\r\nlying asleep in a warm fat bunch in the middle of the half-finished\r\ncastle. This left his brothers and sisters free to work really hard, and\r\nthe hole that was to come out in Australia soon grew so deep that Jane,\r\nwho was called Pussy for short, begged the others to stop.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the bottom of the hole gave way suddenly,\" said she, \"and you\r\ntumbled out among the little Australians, all the sand would get in\r\ntheir eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Robert; \"and they would hate us, and throw stones at us, and\r\nnot let us see the kangaroos, or opossums, or bluegums, or Emu Brand\r\nbirds, or anything.\"\r\n\r\nCyril and Anthea knew that Australia was not quite so near as all that,\r\nbut they agreed to stop using the spades and to go on with their hands.\r\nThis was quite easy, because the sand at the bottom of the hole was very\r\nsoft and fine and dry, like sea-sand. And there were little shells in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy it having been wet sea here once, all sloppy and shiny,\" said\r\nJane, \"with fishes and conger-eels and coral and mermaids.\"\r\n\r\n\"And masts of ships and wrecked Spanish treasure. I wish we could find a\r\ngold doubloon, or something,\" Cyril said.\r\n\r\n\"How did the sea get carried away?\" Robert asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not in a pail, silly,\" said his brother.\r\n\r\n\"Father says the earth got too hot underneath, as you do in bed\r\nsometimes, so it just hunched up its shoulders, and the sea had to slip\r\noff, like the blankets do us, and the shoulder was left sticking out,\r\nand turned into dry land. Let's go and look for shells; I think that\r\nlittle cave looks likely, and I see something sticking out there like a\r\nbit of wrecked ship's anchor, and it's beastly hot in the Australian\r\nhole.\"\r\n\r\nThe others agreed, but Anthea went on digging. She always liked to\r\nfinish a thing when she had once begun it. She felt it would be a\r\ndisgrace to leave that hole without getting through to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe cave was disappointing, because there were no shells, and the\r\nwrecked ship's anchor turned out to be only the broken end of a pick-axe\r\nhandle, and the cave party were just making up their minds that sand\r\nmakes you thirstier when it is not by the seaside, and someone had\r\nsuggested that they all go home for lemonade, when Anthea suddenly\r\nscreamed--\r\n\r\n\"Cyril! Come here! Oh, come quick--It's alive! It'll get away! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nThey all hurried back.\r\n\r\n\"It's a rat, I shouldn't wonder,\" said Robert. \"Father says they infest\r\nold places--and this must be pretty old if the sea was here thousands of\r\nyears ago\"--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is a snake,\" said Jane, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\"Let's look,\" said Cyril, jumping into the hole. \"I'm not afraid of\r\nsnakes. I like them. If it is a snake I'll tame it, and it will follow\r\nme everywhere, and I'll let it sleep round my neck at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't,\" said Robert firmly. He shared Cyril's bedroom. \"But\r\nyou may if it's a rat.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anthea suddenly screamed, \"It's alive!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be silly!\" said Anthea; \"it's not a rat, it's _much_ bigger.\r\nAnd it's not a snake. It's got feet; I saw them; and fur! No--not the\r\nspade. You'll hurt it! Dig with your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"And let _it_ hurt _me_ instead! That's so likely, isn't it?\" said\r\nCyril, seizing a spade.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't!\" said Anthea. \"Squirrel, _don't_. I--it sounds silly, but it\r\nsaid something. It really and truly did\"--\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"It said, 'You let me alone.'\"\r\n\r\nBut Cyril merely observed that his sister must have gone off her head,\r\nand he and Robert dug with spades while Anthea sat on the edge of the\r\nhole, jumping up and down with hotness and anxiety. They dug carefully,\r\nand presently everyone could see that there really was something moving\r\nin the bottom of the Australian hole.\r\n\r\nThen Anthea cried out, \"_I'm_ not afraid. Let me dig,\" and fell on her\r\nknees and began to scratch like a dog does when he has suddenly\r\nremembered where it was that he buried his bone.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I felt fur,\" she cried, half laughing and half crying. \"I did\r\nindeed! I did!\" when suddenly a dry husky voice in the sand made them\r\nall jump back, and their hearts jumped nearly as fast as they did.\r\n\r\n\"Let me alone,\" it said. And now everyone heard the voice and looked at\r\nthe others to see if they had heard it too.\r\n\r\n\"But we want to see you,\" said Robert bravely.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd come out,\" said Anthea, also taking courage.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well--if that's your wish,\" the voice said, and the sand stirred\r\nand spun and scattered, and something brown and furry and fat came\r\nrolling out into the hole, and the sand fell off it, and it sat there\r\nyawning and rubbing the ends of its eyes with its hands.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I must have dropped asleep,\" it said, stretching itself.\r\n\r\nThe children stood round the hole in a ring, looking at the creature\r\nthey had found. It was worth looking at. Its eyes were on long horns\r\nlike a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes;\r\nit had ears like a bat's ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a\r\nspider's and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry\r\ntoo, and it had hands and feet like a monkey's.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is it?\" Jane said. \"Shall we take it home?\"\r\n\r\nThe thing turned its long eyes to look at her, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Does she always talk nonsense, or is it only the rubbish on her head\r\nthat makes her silly?\"\r\n\r\nIt looked scornfully at Jane's hat as it spoke.\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't mean to be silly,\" Anthea said gently; \"we none of us do,\r\nwhatever you may think! Don't be frightened; we don't want to hurt you,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurt _me_!\" it said. \"_Me_ frightened? Upon my word! Why, you talk as\r\nif I were nobody in particular.\" All its fur stood out like a cat's when\r\nit is going to fight.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Anthea, still kindly, \"perhaps if we knew who you are in\r\nparticular we could think of something to say that wouldn't make you\r\nangry. Everything we've said so far seems to have done so. Who are you?\r\nAnd don't get angry! Because really we don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know?\" it said. \"Well, I knew the world had\r\nchanged--but--well, really--Do you mean to tell me seriously you don't\r\nknow a Psammead when you see one?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Sammyadd? That's Greek to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is to everyone,\" said the creature sharply. \"Well, in plain\r\nEnglish, then, a _Sand-fairy_. Don't you know a Sand-fairy when you see\r\none?\"\r\n\r\nIt looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say, \"Of course I\r\nsee you are, _now_. It's quite plain now one comes to look at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You came to look at me, several sentences ago,\" it said crossly,\r\nbeginning to curl up again in the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--don't go away again! Do talk some more,\" Robert cried. \"I didn't\r\nknow you were a Sand-fairy, but I knew directly I saw you that you were\r\nmuch the wonderfullest thing I'd ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sand-fairy seemed a shade less disagreeable after this.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't talking I mind,\" it said, \"as long as you're reasonably civil.\r\nBut I'm not going to make polite conversation for you. If you talk\r\nnicely to me, perhaps I'll answer you, and perhaps I won't. Now say\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nOf course no one could think of anything to say, but at last Robert\r\nthought of \"How long have you lived here?\" and he said it at once.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ages--several thousand years,\" replied the Psammead.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about it. Do.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all in books.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ aren't!\" Jane said. \"Oh, tell us everything you can about\r\nyourself! We don't know anything about you, and you _are_ so nice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sand-fairy smoothed his long rat-like whiskers and smiled between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Do please tell!\" said the children all together.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how quickly you get used to things, even the most\r\nastonishing. Five minutes before, the children had had no more idea than\r\nyou had that there was such a thing as a Sand-fairy in the world, and\r\nnow they were talking to it as though they had known it all their lives.\r\n\r\nIt drew its eyes in and said--\r\n\r\n\"How very sunny it is--quite like old times! Where do you get your\r\nMegatheriums from now?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said the children all at once. It is very difficult always to\r\nremember that \"what\" is not polite, especially in moments of surprise or\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"Are Pterodactyls plentiful now?\" the Sand-fairy went on.\r\n\r\nThe children were unable to reply.\r\n\r\n\"What do you have for breakfast?\" the Fairy said impatiently, \"and who\r\ngives it to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eggs and bacon, and bread and milk, and porridge and things.\r\nMother gives it to us. What are Mega-what's-its-names and\r\nPtero-what-do-you-call-thems? And does anyone have them for breakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, almost everyone had Pterodactyl for breakfast in my time!\r\nPterodactyls were something like crocodiles and something like birds--I\r\nbelieve they were very good grilled. You see, it was like this: of\r\ncourse there were heaps of Sand-fairies then, and in the morning early\r\nyou went out and hunted for them, and when you'd found one it gave you\r\nyour wish. People used to send their little boys down to the seashore in\r\nthe morning before breakfast to get the day's wishes, and very often the\r\neldest boy in the family would be told to wish for a Megatherium, ready\r\njointed for cooking. It was as big as an elephant, you see, so there was\r\na good deal of meat on it. And if they wanted fish, the Ichthyosaurus\r\nwas asked for,--he was twenty to forty feet long, so there was plenty of\r\nhim. And for poultry there was the Plesiosaurus; there were nice\r\npickings on that too. Then the other children could wish for other\r\nthings. But when people had dinner-parties it was nearly always\r\nMegatheriums; and Ichthyosaurus, because his fins were a great delicacy\r\nand his tail made soup.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat left over,\" said\r\nAnthea, who meant to be a good housekeeper some day.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said the Psammead, \"that would never have done. Why, of course\r\nat sunset what was left over turned into stone. You find the stone bones\r\nof the Megatherium and things all over the place even now, they tell\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who tell you?\" asked Cyril; but the Sand-fairy frowned and began to dig\r\nvery fast with its furry hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't go!\" they all cried; \"tell us more about when it was\r\nMegatheriums for breakfast! Was the world like this then?\"\r\n\r\nIt stopped digging.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" it said; \"it was nearly all sand where I lived, and coal\r\ngrew on trees, and the periwinkles were as big as tea-trays--you find\r\nthem now; they're turned into stone. We Sand-fairies used to live on the\r\nseashore, and the children used to come with their little flint-spades\r\nand flint-pails and make castles for us to live in. That's thousands of\r\nyears ago, but I hear that children still build castles on the sand.\r\nIt's difficult to break yourself of a habit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did you stop living in the castles?\" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n\"It's a sad story,\" said the Psammead gloomily. \"It was because they\r\n_would_ build moats to the castles, and the nasty wet bubbling sea used\r\nto come in, and of course as soon as a Sand-fairy got wet it caught\r\ncold, and generally died. And so there got to be fewer and fewer, and,\r\nwhenever you found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a\r\nMegatherium, and eat twice as much as you wanted, because it might be\r\nweeks before you got another wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did _you_ get wet?\" Robert inquired.\r\n\r\nThe Sand-fairy shuddered. \"Only once,\" it said; \"the end of the twelfth\r\nhair of my top left whisker--I feel the place still in damp weather. It\r\nwas only once, but it was quite enough for me. I went away as soon as\r\nthe sun had dried my poor dear whisker. I scurried away to the back of\r\nthe beach, and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand, and there I've\r\nbeen ever since. And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards. And now\r\nI'm not going to tell you another thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just one more, please,\" said the children. \"Can you give wishes now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said it; \"didn't I give you yours a few minutes ago? You\r\nsaid, 'I wish you'd come out,' and I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, mayn't we have another?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but be quick about it. I'm tired of you.\"\r\n\r\nI daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three\r\nwishes given you, and have despised the old man and his wife in the\r\nblack-pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance you\r\ncould think of three really useful wishes without a moment's hesitation.\r\nThese children had often talked this matter over, but, now the chance\r\nhad suddenly come to them, they could not make up their minds.\r\n\r\n\"Quick,\" said the Sand-fairy crossly. No one could think of anything,\r\nonly Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her own and Jane's\r\nwhich they had never told the boys. She knew the boys would not care\r\nabout it--but still it was better than nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we were all as beautiful as the day,\" she said in a great hurry.\r\n\r\nThe children looked at each other, but each could see that the others\r\nwere not any better-looking than usual. The Psammead pushed out his long\r\neyes, and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out till\r\nit was twice as fat and furry as before. Suddenly it let its breath go\r\nin a long sigh.\r\n\r\n\"I'm really afraid I can't manage it,\" it said apologetically; \"I must\r\nbe out of practice.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were horribly disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _do_ try again!\" they said.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Sand-fairy, \"the fact is, I was keeping back a little\r\nstrength to give the rest of you your wishes with. If you'll be\r\ncontented with one wish a day among the lot of you I daresay I can\r\nscrew myself up to it. Do you agree to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, oh yes!\" said Jane and Anthea. The boys nodded. They did not\r\nbelieve the Sand-fairy could do it. You can always make girls believe\r\nthings much easier than you can boys.\r\n\r\nIt stretched out its eyes farther than ever, and swelled and swelled and\r\nswelled.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope it won't hurt itself,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Or crack its skin,\" Robert said anxiously.\r\n\r\nEveryone was very much relieved when the Sand-fairy, after getting so\r\nbig that it almost filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its\r\nbreath and went back to its proper size.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" it said, panting heavily. \"It'll come easier\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it hurt much?\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Only my poor whisker, thank you,\" said he, \"but you're a kind and\r\nthoughtful child. Good day.\"\r\n\r\nIt scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and\r\ndisappeared in the sand.\r\n\r\nThen the children looked at each other, and each child suddenly found\r\nitself alone with three perfect strangers, all radiantly beautiful.\r\n\r\nThey stood for some moments in silence. Each thought that its brothers\r\nand sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had stolen\r\nup unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the Sand-fairy.\r\nAnthea spoke first--\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" she said very politely to Jane, who now had enormous blue\r\neyes and a cloud of russet hair, \"but have you seen two little boys and\r\na little girl anywhere about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just going to ask you that,\" said Jane. And then Cyril cried--\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's _you_! I know the hole in your pinafore! You _are_ Jane,\r\naren't you? And you're the Panther; I can see your dirty handkerchief\r\nthat you forgot to change after you'd cut your thumb! The wish _has_\r\ncome off, after all. I say, am I as handsome as you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you're Cyril, I liked you much better as you were before,\" said\r\nAnthea decidedly. \"You look like the picture of the young chorister,\r\nwith your golden hair; you'll die young, I shouldn't wonder. And if\r\nthat's Robert, he's like an Italian organ-grinder. His hair's all\r\nblack.\"\r\n\r\n\"You two girls are like Christmas cards, then--that's all--silly\r\nChristmas cards,\" said Robert angrily. \"And Jane's hair is simply\r\ncarrots.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's no use finding fault with each other,\" said Anthea; \"let's\r\nget the Lamb and lug it home to dinner. The servants will admire us most\r\nawfully, you'll see.\"\r\n\r\nBaby was just waking up when they got to him, and not one of the\r\nchildren but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful\r\nas the day, but just the same as usual.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he's too young to have wishes naturally,\" said Jane. \"We\r\nshall have to mention him specially next time.\"\r\n\r\nAnthea ran forward and held out her arms.\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe Baby looked at her disapprovingly, and put a sandy pink thumb in his\r\nmouth. Anthea was his favourite sister.\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"G'way 'long!\" said the Baby.\r\n\r\n\"Come to own Pussy,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Wants my Panty,\" said the Lamb dismally, and his lip trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Here, come on, Veteran,\" said Robert, \"come and have a yidey on Yobby's\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah, narky narky boy,\" howled the Baby, giving way altogether. Then the\r\nchildren knew the worst. _The Baby did not know them!_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The baby did not know them!]\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in despair, and it was terrible to each, in\r\nthis dire emergency, to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect\r\nstrangers, instead of the merry, friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly\r\nlittle eyes of its own brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n\"This is most truly awful,\" said Cyril when he had tried to lift up the\r\nLamb, and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull!\r\n\"We've got to _make friends_ with him! I can't carry him home screaming\r\nlike that. Fancy having to make friends with our own baby!--it's too\r\nsilly.\"\r\n\r\nThat, however, was exactly what they had to do. It took over an hour,\r\nand the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was\r\nby this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert.\r\n\r\nAt last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by\r\nturns, but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a\r\ndead weight, and most exhausting.\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness, we're home!\" said Jane, staggering through the iron\r\ngate to where Martha, the nursemaid, stood at the front door shading her\r\neyes with her hand and looking out anxiously. \"Here! Do take Baby!\"\r\n\r\nMartha snatched the Baby from her arms.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks be, _he's_ safe back,\" she said. \"Where are the others, and\r\nwhoever to goodness gracious are all of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're _us_, of course,\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"And who's Us, when you're at home?\" asked Martha scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you it's _us_, only we're beautiful as the day,\" said Cyril.\r\n\"I'm Cyril, and these are the others, and we're jolly hungry. Let us in,\r\nand don't be a silly idiot.\"\r\n\r\nMartha merely dratted Cyril's impudence and tried to shut the door in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"I know we _look_ different, but I'm Anthea, and we're so tired, and\r\nit's long past dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go home to your dinners, whoever you are; and if our children put\r\nyou up to this play-acting you can tell them from me they'll catch it,\r\nso they know what to expect!\" With that she did bang the door. Cyril\r\nrang the bell violently. No answer. Presently cook put her head out of a\r\nbedroom window and said--\r\n\r\n\"If you don't take yourselves off, and that precious sharp, I'll go and\r\nfetch the police.\" And she slammed down the window.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good,\" said Anthea. \"Oh, do, do come away before we get sent to\r\nprison!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys said it was nonsense, and the law of England couldn't put you\r\nin prison for just being as beautiful as the day, but all the same they\r\nfollowed the others out into the lane.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Cyril said sadly; \"it mayn't be like that now--things\r\nhave changed a good deal since Megatherium times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Anthea suddenly, \"perhaps we shall turn into stone at\r\nsunset, like the Megatheriums did, so that there mayn't be any of us\r\nleft over for the next day.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to cry, so did Jane. Even the boys turned pale. No one had the\r\nheart to say anything.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrible afternoon. There was no house near where the children\r\ncould beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water. They were afraid to\r\ngo to the village, because they had seen Martha go down there with a\r\nbasket, and there was a local constable. True, they were all as\r\nbeautiful as the day, but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry\r\nas a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge.\r\n\r\nThree times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to\r\nlet them in and listen to their tale. And then Robert went alone, hoping\r\nto be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door\r\nto the others. But all the windows were out of reach, and Martha emptied\r\na toilet-jug of cold water over him from a top window, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Go along with you, you nasty little Eye-talian monkey.\"\r\n\r\nIt came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with\r\ntheir feet in a dry ditch, waiting for sunset, and wondering whether,\r\nwhen the sun _did_ set, they would turn into stone, or only into their\r\nown old natural selves; and each of them still felt lonely and among\r\nstrangers, and tried not to look at the others, for, though their voices\r\nwere their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite\r\nirritating to look at.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe we _shall_ turn to stone,\" said Robert, breaking a long\r\nmiserable silence, \"because the Sand-fairy said he'd give us another\r\nwish to-morrow, and he couldn't if we were stone, could he?\"\r\n\r\nThe others said \"No,\" but they weren't at all comforted.\r\n\r\nAnother silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril's\r\nsuddenly saying, \"I don't want to frighten you girls, but I believe it's\r\nbeginning with me already. My foot's quite dead. I'm turning to stone, I\r\nknow I am, and so will you in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Robert kindly, \"perhaps you'll be the only stone one,\r\nand the rest of us will be all right, and we'll cherish your statue and\r\nhang garlands on it.\"\r\n\r\nBut when it turned out that Cyril's foot had only gone to sleep through\r\nhis sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in an\r\nagony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross.\r\n\r\n\"Giving us such a fright for nothing!\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him]\r\n\r\nThe third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane. She\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"If we _do_ come out of this all right, we'll ask the Sammyadd to make\r\nit so that the servants don't notice anything different, no matter what\r\nwishes we have.\"\r\n\r\nThe others only grunted. They were too wretched even to make good\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nAt last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness--four very nasty\r\nthings--all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that was sleep.\r\nThe children lay asleep in a row, with their beautiful eyes shut and\r\ntheir beautiful mouths open. Anthea woke first. The sun had set, and the\r\ntwilight was coming on.\r\n\r\nAnthea pinched herself very hard, to make sure, and when she found she\r\ncould still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone, and then\r\nshe pinched the others. They, also, were soft.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up,\" she said, almost in tears for joy; \"it's all right, we're not\r\nstone. And oh, Cyril, how nice and ugly you do look, with your old\r\nfreckles and your brown hair and your little eyes. And so do you all!\"\r\nshe added, so that they might not feel jealous.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home they were very much scolded by Martha, who told them\r\nabout the strange children.\r\n\r\n\"A good-looking lot, I must say, but that impudent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless it would be\r\nto try to explain things to Martha.\r\n\r\n\"And where on earth have you been all this time, you naughty little\r\nthings, you?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the lane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you come home hours ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't because of _them_,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The children who were as beautiful as the day. They kept us there till\r\nafter sunset. We couldn't come back till they'd gone. You don't know how\r\nwe hated them! Oh, do, do give us some supper--we are so hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hungry! I should think so,\" said Martha angrily; \"out all day like\r\nthis. Well, I hope it'll be a lesson to you not to go picking up with\r\nstrange children--down here after measles, as likely as not! Now mind,\r\nif you see them again, don't you speak to them--not one word nor so\r\nmuch as a look--but come straight away and tell me. I'll spoil their\r\nbeauty for them!\"\r\n\r\n\"If ever we _do_ see them again we'll tell you,\" Anthea said; and\r\nRobert, fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought\r\nin on a tray by cook, added in heartfelt undertones--\r\n\r\n\"And we'll take jolly good care we never _do_ see them again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they never have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGOLDEN GUINEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in which she\r\nwas walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without an\r\numbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain,\r\nand were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and\r\nthe rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular\r\nbreathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still\r\nasleep. The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face from the wet\r\ncorner of a bath-towel out of which her brother Robert was gently\r\nsqueezing the water, to wake her up, as he now explained.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, drop it!\" she said rather crossly; so he did, for he was not a\r\nbrutal brother, though very ingenious in apple-pie beds, booby-traps,\r\noriginal methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other\r\nlittle accomplishments which make home happy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face]\r\n\r\n\"I had such a funny dream,\" Anthea began.\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" said Jane, wakening suddenly and without warning. \"I dreamed\r\nwe found a Sand-fairy in the gravel-pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd,\r\nand we might have a new wish every day, and\"----\r\n\r\n\"But that's what _I_ dreamed,\" said Robert; \"I was just going to tell\r\nyou,--and we had the first wish directly it said so. And I dreamed you\r\ngirls were donkeys enough to ask for us all to be beautiful as day, and\r\nwe jolly well were, and it was perfectly beastly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _can_ different people all dream the same thing?\" said Anthea,\r\nsitting up in bed, \"because I dreamed all that as well as about the Zoo\r\nand the rain; and Baby didn't know us in my dream, and the servants shut\r\nus out of the house because the radiantness of our beauty was such a\r\ncomplete disguise, and\"----\r\n\r\nThe voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Robert,\" it said, \"you'll be late for breakfast again--unless\r\nyou mean to shirk your bath as you did on Tuesday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, come here a second,\" Robert replied; \"I didn't shirk it; I had\r\nit after brekker in father's dressing-room because ours was emptied\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nCyril appeared in the doorway, partially clothed.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Anthea, \"we've all had such an odd dream. We've all\r\ndreamed we found a Sand-fairy.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice died away before Cyril's contemptuous glance.\r\n\r\n\"Dream?\" he said; \"you little sillies, it's _true_. I tell you it all\r\nhappened. That's why I'm so keen on being down early. We'll go up there\r\ndirectly after brekker, and have another wish. Only we'll make up our\r\nminds, solid, before we go, what it is we do want, and no one must ask\r\nfor anything unless the others agree first. No more peerless beauties\r\nfor this child, thank you. Not if I know it!\"\r\n\r\nThe other three dressed, with their mouths open. If all that dream about\r\nthe Sand-fairy was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream,\r\nthe girls thought. Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not\r\nsure, till after they had seen Martha and heard her full and plain\r\nreminders about their naughty conduct the day before. Then Anthea was\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said she, \"servants never dream anything but the things in\r\nthe Dream-book, like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding--that\r\nmeans a funeral, and snakes are a false female friend, and oysters are\r\nbabies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking of babies,\" said Cyril, \"where's the Lamb?\"\r\n\r\n\"Martha's going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins. Mother said\r\nshe might. She's dressing him now,\" said Jane, \"in his very best coat\r\nand hat. Bread-and-butter, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seems to like taking him too,\" said Robert in a tone of wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Servants _do_ like taking babies to see their relations,\" Cyril said;\r\n\"I've noticed it before--especially in their best clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect they pretend they're their own babies, and that they're not\r\nservants at all, but married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say\r\nthe babies are the little dukes and duchesses,\" Jane suggested dreamily,\r\ntaking more marmalade. \"I expect that's what Martha'll say to her\r\ncousin. She'll enjoy herself most frightfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our infant duke to\r\nRochester,\" said Robert; \"not if she's anything like me--she won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back!\" said Cyril in\r\nfull agreement.\r\n\r\n\"She's gone by the carrier's cart,\" said Jane. \"Let's see them off, then\r\nwe shall have done a polite and kindly act, and we shall be quite sure\r\nwe've got rid of them for the day.\"\r\n\r\nSo they did.\r\n\r\nMartha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the\r\nchest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink\r\ncornflowers and white ribbon. She had a yellow-lace collar with a green\r\nbow. And the Lamb had indeed his very best cream-colored silk coat and\r\nhat. It was a smart party that the carrier's cart picked up at the Cross\r\nRoads. When its white tilt and red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl\r\nof chalk-dust--\r\n\r\n\"And now for the Sammyadd!\" said Cyril, and off they went.\r\n\r\nAs they went they decided on the wish they would ask for. Although they\r\nwere all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of\r\nthe gravel-pit, but went round by the safe lower road, as if they had\r\nbeen carts.\r\n\r\nThey had made a ring of stones round the place where the Sand-fairy had\r\ndisappeared, so they easily found the spot. The sun was burning and\r\nbright, and the sky was deep blue--without a cloud. The sand was very\r\nhot to touch.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--suppose it was only a dream, after all,\" Robert said as the boys\r\nuncovered their spades from the sand-heap where they had buried them\r\nand began to dig.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you were a sensible chap,\" said Cyril; \"one's quite as likely\r\nas the other!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head,\" Robert snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we girls take a turn,\" said Jane, laughing. \"You boys seem to\r\nbe getting very warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you don't come putting your silly oar in,\" said Robert, who was\r\nnow warm indeed.\r\n\r\n\"We won't,\" said Anthea quickly. \"Robert dear, don't be so grumpy--we\r\nwon't say a word, you shall be the one to speak to the Fairy and tell\r\nhim what we've decided to wish for. You'll say it much better than we\r\nshall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you drop being a little humbug,\" said Robert, but not crossly.\r\n\"Look out--dig with your hands, now!\"\r\n\r\nSo they did, and presently uncovered the spider-shaped brown hairy body,\r\nlong arms and legs, bat's ears and snail's eyes of the Sand-fairy\r\nhimself. Everyone drew a deep breath of satisfaction, for now of course\r\nit couldn't have been a dream.\r\n\r\nThe Psammead sat up and shook the sand out of its fur.\r\n\r\n\"How's your left whisker this morning?\" said Anthea politely.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to boast of,\" said it; \"it had rather a restless night. But\r\nthank you for asking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Robert, \"do you feel up to giving wishes to-day, because\r\nwe very much want an extra besides the regular one? The extra's a very\r\nlittle one,\" he added reassuringly.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said the Sand-fairy. (If you read this story aloud, please\r\npronounce \"humph\" exactly as it is spelt, for that is how he said it.)\r\n\"Humph! Do you know, until I heard you being disagreeable to each other\r\njust over my head, and so loud too, I really quite thought I had dreamed\r\nyou all. I do have very odd dreams sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" Jane hurried to say, so as to get away from the subject of\r\ndisagreeableness. \"I wish,\" she added politely, \"you'd tell us about\r\nyour dreams--they must be awfully interesting\"--\r\n\r\n\"Is that the day's wish?\" said the Sand-fairy, yawning.\r\n\r\nCyril muttered something about \"just like a girl,\" and the rest stood\r\nsilent. If they said \"Yes,\" then good-bye to the other wishes they had\r\ndecided to ask for. If they said \"No,\" it would be very rude, and they\r\nhad all been taught manners, and had learned a little too, which is not\r\nat all the same thing. A sigh of relief broke from all lips when the\r\nSand-fairy said--\r\n\r\n\"If I do, I shan't have strength to give you a second wish; not even\r\ngood tempers, or common-sense, or manners, or little things like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want you to put yourself out at all about _these_ things, we\r\ncan manage them quite well ourselves,\" said Cyril eagerly; while the\r\nothers looked guiltily at each other, and wished the Fairy would not\r\nkeep all on about good tempers, but give them one good scolding if it\r\nwanted to, and then have done with it.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Psammead, putting out his long snail's eyes so suddenly\r\nthat one of them nearly went into the round boy's eye of Robert, \"let's\r\nhave the little wish first.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want the servants to notice the gifts you give us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are kind enough to give us,\" said Anthea in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Are kind enough to give us, I mean,\" said Robert.\r\n\r\nThe Fairy swelled himself out a bit, let his breath go, and said--\r\n\r\n\"I've done _that_ for you--it was quite easy. People don't notice things\r\nmuch, anyway. What's the next wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"We want,\" said Robert slowly, \"to be rich beyond the dreams of\r\nsomething or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Avarice,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" said the Fairy unexpectedly. \"But it won't do you much good,\r\nthat's one comfort,\" it muttered to itself. \"Come--I can't go beyond\r\ndreams, you know! How much do you want, and will you have it in gold or\r\nnotes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gold, please--and millions of it\"--\r\n\r\n\"This gravel-pit full be enough?\" said the Fairy in an off-hand manner.\r\n\r\n\"Oh _yes_\"--\r\n\r\n\"Then go out before I begin, or you'll be buried alive in it.\"\r\n\r\nIt made its skinny arms so long, and waved them so frighteningly, that\r\nthe children ran as hard as they could towards the road by which carts\r\nused to come to the gravel-pits. Only Anthea had presence of mind enough\r\nto shout a timid \"Good-morning, I hope your whisker will be better\r\nto-morrow,\" as she ran.\r\n\r\nOn the road they turned and looked back, and they had to shut their\r\neyes, and open them very slowly, a little bit at a time, because the\r\nsight was too dazzling for their eyes to be able to bear. It was\r\nsomething like trying to look at the sun at high noon on Midsummer Day.\r\nFor the whole of the sand-pit was full, right up to the very top, with\r\nnew shining gold pieces, and all the little bank-martins' little front\r\ndoors were covered out of sight. Where the road for carts wound into the\r\ngravel-pit the gold lay in heaps like stones lie by the roadside, and a\r\ngreat bank of shining gold shelved down from where it lay flat and\r\nsmooth between the tall sides of the gravel-pit. And all the gleaming\r\nheaps was minted gold. And on the sides and edges of these countless\r\ncoins the mid-day sun shone and sparkled, and glowed and gleamed till\r\nthe quarry looked like the mouth of a smelting furnace, or one of the\r\nfairy halls that you see sometimes in the sky at sunset.\r\n\r\nThe children stood with their mouths open, and no one said a word.\r\n\r\nAt last Robert stooped and picked up one of the loose coins from the\r\nedge of the heap by the cart-road, and looked at it. He looked on both\r\nsides. Then he said in a low voice, quite different to his own, \"It's\r\nnot sovereigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's gold, anyway,\" said Cyril. And now they all began to talk at once.\r\nThey all picked up the golden treasure by handfuls and let it run\r\nthrough their fingers like water, and the chink it made as it fell was\r\nwonderful music. At first they quite forgot to think of spending the\r\nmoney, it was so nice to play with. Jane sat down between two heaps of\r\nthe gold, and Robert began to bury her, as you bury your father in sand\r\nwhen you are at the seaside and he has gone to sleep on the beach with\r\nhis newspaper over his face. But Jane was not half buried before she\r\ncried out, \"Oh stop, it's too heavy! It hurts!\"\r\n\r\nRobert said \"Bosh!\" and went on.\r\n\r\n\"Let me out, I tell you,\" cried Jane, and was taken out, very white, and\r\ntrembling a little.\r\n\r\n\"You've no idea what it's like,\" said she; \"it's like stones on you--or\r\nlike chains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" Cyril said, \"if this is to do us any good, it's no good our\r\nstaying gasping at it like this. Let's fill our pockets and go and buy\r\nthings. Don't you forget, it won't last after sunset. I wish we'd asked\r\nthe Sammyadd why things don't turn to stone. Perhaps this will. I'll\r\ntell you what, there's a pony and cart in the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to buy that?\" asked Jane.\r\n\r\n\"No, silly,--we'll _hire_ it. And then we'll go to Rochester and buy\r\nheaps and heaps of things. Look here, let's each take as much as we can\r\ncarry. But it's not sovereigns. They've got a man's head on one side and\r\na thing like the ace of spades on the other. Fill your pockets with it,\r\nI tell you, and come along. You can talk as we go--if you _must_ talk.\"\r\n\r\nCyril sat down and began to fill his pockets.\r\n\r\n\"You made fun of me for getting father to have nine pockets in my suit,\"\r\nsaid he, \"but now you see!\"\r\n\r\nThey did. For when Cyril had filled his nine pockets and his\r\nhandkerchief and the space between himself and his shirt front with the\r\ngold coins, he had to stand up. But he staggered, and had to sit down\r\nagain in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\"Throw out some of the cargo,\" said Robert. \"You'll sink the ship, old\r\nchap. That comes of nine pockets.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Cyril had to do so.\r\n\r\nThen they set off to walk to the village. It was more than a mile, and\r\nthe road was very dusty indeed, and the sun seemed to get hotter and\r\nhotter, and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier.\r\n\r\nIt was Jane who said, \"I don't see how we're to spend it all. There must\r\nbe thousands of pounds among the lot of us. I'm going to leave some of\r\nmine behind this stump in the hedge. And directly we get to the village\r\nwe'll buy some biscuits; I know it's long past dinner-time.\" She took\r\nout a handful or two of gold and hid it in the hollows of an old\r\nhornbeam. \"How round and yellow they are,\" she said. \"Don't you wish\r\nthey were made of gingerbread and we were going to eat them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're not, and we're not,\" said Cyril. \"Come on!\"\r\n\r\nBut they came on heavily and wearily. Before they reached the village,\r\nmore than one stump in the hedge concealed its little hoard of hidden\r\ntreasure. Yet they reached the village with about twelve hundred guineas\r\nin their pockets. But in spite of this inside wealth they looked\r\nquite ordinary outside, and no one would have thought they could have\r\nmore than a half-crown each at the outside. The haze of heat, the blue\r\nof the wood smoke, made a sort of dim misty cloud over the red roofs of\r\nthe village. The four sat down heavily on the first bench to which they\r\ncame. It happened to be outside the Blue Boar Inn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He staggered, and had to sit down again in a hurry]\r\n\r\nIt was decided that Cyril should go into the Blue Boar and ask for\r\nginger-beer, because, as Anthea said, \"It was not wrong for men to go\r\ninto beer-saloons, only for children. And Cyril is nearer being a man\r\nthan us, because he is the eldest.\" So he went. The others sat in the\r\nsun and waited.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how hot it is!\" said Robert. \"Dogs put their tongues out when\r\nthey're hot; I wonder if it would cool us at all to put out ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might try,\" Jane said; and they all put their tongues out as far as\r\never they could go, so that it quite stretched their throats, but it\r\nonly seemed to make them thirstier than ever, besides annoying everyone\r\nwho went by. So they took their tongues in again, just as Cyril came\r\nback with ginger-beer.\r\n\r\n\"I had to pay for it out of my own money, though, that I was going to\r\nbuy rabbits with,\" he said. \"They wouldn't change the gold. And when I\r\npulled out a handful the man just laughed and said it was card-counters.\r\nAnd I got some sponge-cakes too, out of a glass jar on the bar-counter.\r\nAnd some biscuits with caraways in.\"\r\n\r\nThe sponge-cakes were both soft and dry and the biscuits were dry too,\r\nand yet soft, which biscuits ought not to be. But the ginger-beer made\r\nup for everything.\r\n\r\n\"It's my turn now to try to buy something with the money,\" Anthea said;\r\n\"I'm next eldest. Where is the pony-cart kept?\"\r\n\r\nIt was at The Chequers, and Anthea went in the back way to the yard,\r\nbecause they all knew that little girls ought not to go into the bars of\r\nbeer-saloons. She came out, as she herself said, \"pleased but not\r\nproud.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll be ready in a brace of shakes, he says,\" she remarked, \"and he's\r\nto have one sovereign--or whatever it is--to drive us into Rochester and\r\nback, besides waiting there till we've got everything we want. I think I\r\nmanaged very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think yourself jolly clever, I daresay,\" said Cyril moodily. \"How\r\ndid you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't jolly clever enough to go taking handfuls of money out of my\r\npocket, to make it seem cheap, anyway,\" she retorted. \"I just found a\r\nyoung man doing something to a horse's legs with a sponge and a pail.\r\nAnd I held out one sovereign, and I said--'Do you know what this is?' He\r\nsaid 'No,' and he'd call his father. And the old man came, and he said\r\nit was a spade guinea; and he said was it my own to do as I liked with,\r\nand I said 'Yes'; and I asked about the pony-cart, and I said he could\r\nhave the guinea if he'd drive us into Rochester. And his name is S.\r\nCrispin. And he said, 'Right oh.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was a new sensation to be driven in a smart pony-trap along pretty\r\ncountry roads; it was very pleasant too (which is not always the case\r\nwith new sensations), quite apart from the beautiful plans of spending\r\nthe money which each child made as they went along, silently of course\r\nand quite to itself, for they felt it would never have done to let the\r\nold innkeeper hear them talk in the affluent sort of way in which they\r\nwere thinking. The old man put them down by the bridge at their request.\r\n\r\n\"If you were going to buy a carriage and horses, where would you go?\"\r\nasked Cyril, as if he were only asking for the sake of something to say.\r\n\r\n\"Billy Peasemarsh, at the Saracen's Head,\" said the old man promptly.\r\n\"Though all forbid I should recommend any man where it's a question of\r\nhorses, no more than I'd take anybody else's recommending if I was\r\na-buying one. But if your pa's thinking of a rig of any sort, there\r\nain't a straighter man in Rochester, nor civiller spoken, than Billy,\r\nthough I says it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Cyril. \"The Saracen's Head.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the children began to see one of the laws of nature turn upside\r\ndown and stand on its head like an acrobat. Any grown-up person would\r\ntell you that money is hard to get and easy to spend. But the fairy\r\nmoney had been easy to get, and spending it was not only hard, it was\r\nalmost impossible. The trades-people of Rochester seemed to shrink, to a\r\ntrades-person, from the glittering fairy gold (\"furrin money\" they\r\ncalled it, for the most part).\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Anthea, who had had the misfortune to sit on her hat\r\nearlier in the day, wished to buy another. She chose a very beautiful\r\none, trimmed with pink roses and the blue breasts of peacocks. It was\r\nmarked in the window, \"Paris Model, three guineas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad,\" she said, \"because it says guineas, and not sovereigns,\r\nwhich we haven't got.\"\r\n\r\nBut when she took three of the spade guineas in her hand, which was by\r\nthis time rather dirty owing to her not having put on gloves before\r\ngoing to the gravel-pit, the black-silk young lady in the shop looked\r\nvery hard at her, and went and whispered something to an older and\r\nuglier lady, also in black silk, and then they gave her back the money\r\nand said it was not current coin.\r\n\r\n\"It's good money,\" said Anthea, \"and it's my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay,\" said the lady, \"but it's not the kind of money that's\r\nfashionable now, and we don't care about taking it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe they think we've stolen it,\" said Anthea, rejoining the\r\nothers in the street; \"if we had gloves they wouldn't think we were so\r\ndishonest. It's my hands being so dirty fills their minds with doubts.\"\r\n\r\nSo they chose a humble shop, and the girls bought cotton gloves, the\r\nkind at a shilling, but when they offered a guinea the woman looked at\r\nit through her spectacles and said she had no change; so the gloves had\r\nto be paid for out of Cyril's money with which he meant to buy rabbits\r\nand so had the green imitation crocodile-skin purse at nine-pence which\r\nhad been bought at the same time. They tried several more shops, the\r\nkinds where you buy toys and perfume and silk handkerchiefs and books,\r\nand fancy boxes of stationery, and photographs of objects of interest in\r\nthe vicinity. But nobody cared to change a guinea that day in Rochester,\r\nand as they went from shop to shop they got dirtier and dirtier, and\r\ntheir hair got more and more untidy, and Jane slipped and fell down on a\r\npart of the road where a water cart had just gone by. Also they got very\r\nhungry, but they found no one would give them anything to eat for their\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nAfter trying two baker shops in vain, they became so hungry, perhaps\r\nfrom the smell of the cake in the shops, as Cyril suggested, that they\r\nformed a plan of campaign in whispers and carried it out in desperation.\r\nThey marched into a third baker shop,--Beale was his name,--and before\r\nthe people behind the counter could interfere each child had seized\r\nthree new penny buns, clapped the three together between its dirty\r\nhands, and taken a big bite out of the triple sandwich. Then they stood\r\nat bay, with the twelve buns in their hands and their mouths very full\r\nindeed. The shocked baker's man bounded round the corner.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said Cyril, speaking as distinctly as he could, and holding out\r\nthe guinea he got ready before entering the shops, \"pay yourself out of\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Beale snatched the coin, bit it, and put it in his\r\npocket]\r\n\r\n\"Off you go,\" he said, brief and stern like the man in the song.\r\n\r\n\"But the change?\" said Anthea, who had a saving mind.\r\n\r\n\"Change!\" said the man, \"I'll change you! Hout you goes; and you may\r\nthink yourselves lucky I don't send for the police to find out where you\r\ngot it!\"\r\n\r\nIn the Gardens of the Castle the millionaires finished the buns, and\r\nthough the curranty softness of these were delicious, and acted like a\r\ncharm in raising the spirits of the party, yet even the stoutest heart\r\nquailed at the thought of venturing to sound Mr. Billy Peasemarsh at the\r\nSaracen's Head on the subject of a horse and carriage. The boys would\r\nhave given up the idea, but Jane was always a hopeful child, and Anthea\r\ngenerally an obstinate one, and their earnestness prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe whole party, by this time indescribably dirty, therefore betook\r\nitself to the Saracen's Head. The yard-method of attack having been\r\nsuccessful at The Chequers, was tried again here. Mr. Peasemarsh was in\r\nthe yard, and Robert opened the business in these terms--\r\n\r\n\"They tell me you have a lot of horses and carriages to sell.\" It had\r\nbeen agreed that Robert should be spokesman, because in books it is\r\nalways gentlemen who buy horses, and not ladies, and Cyril had had his\r\ngo at the Blue Boar.\r\n\r\n\"They tell you true, young man,\" said Mr. Peasemarsh. He was a long lean\r\nman, with very blue eyes and a tight mouth and narrow lips.\r\n\r\n\"We should like to buy some, please,\" said Robert politely.\r\n\r\n\"I daresay you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you show us a few, please? To choose from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you a-kiddin of?\" inquired Mr. Billy Peasemarsh. \"Was you sent\r\nhere of a message?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" said Robert, \"we want to buy some horses and carriages,\r\nand a man told us you were straight and civil spoken, but I shouldn't\r\nwonder if he was mistaken\"--\r\n\r\n\"Upon my sacred!\" said Mr. Peasemarsh. \"Shall I trot the whole stable\r\nout for your Honor's worship to see? Or shall I send round to the\r\nBishop's to see if he's a nag or two to dispose of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please do,\" said Robert, \"if it's not too much trouble. It would be\r\nvery kind of you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peasemarsh put his hands in his pockets and laughed, and they did\r\nnot like the way he did it. Then he shouted \"Willum!\"\r\n\r\nA stooping ostler appeared in a stable door.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Willum, come and look at this 'ere young dook! Wants to buy the\r\nwhole stud, lock, stock, and bar'l. And ain't got tuppence in his\r\npocket to bless hisself with, I'll go bail!\"\r\n\r\nWillum's eyes followed his master's pointing thumb with contemptuous\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"Do 'e, for sure?\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut Robert spoke, though both the girls were now pulling at his jacket\r\nand begging him to \"come along.\" He spoke, and he was very angry; he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a young duke, and I never pretended to be. And as for\r\ntuppence--what do you call this?\" And before the others could stop him\r\nhe had pulled out two fat handfuls of shining guineas, and held them out\r\nfor Mr. Peasemarsh to look at. He did look. He snatched one up in his\r\nfinger and thumb. He bit it, and Jane expected him to say, \"The best\r\nhorse in my stables is at your service.\" But the others knew better.\r\nStill it was a blow, even to the most desponding, when he said shortly--\r\n\r\n\"Willum, shut the yard doors;\" and Willum grinned and went to shut them.\r\n\r\n\"Good-afternoon,\" said Robert hastily; \"we shan't buy any horses now,\r\nwhatever you say, and I hope it'll be a lesson to you.\" He had seen a\r\nlittle side gate open, and was moving towards it as he spoke. But Billy\r\nPeasemarsh put himself in the way.\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast, you young off-scouring!\" he said. \"Willum, fetch the\r\npleece.\"\r\n\r\nWillum went. The children stood huddled together like frightened sheep,\r\nand Mr. Peasemarsh spoke to them till the pleece arrived. He said many\r\nthings. Among other things he said--\r\n\r\n\"Nice lot you are, aren't you, coming tempting honest men with your\r\nguineas!\"\r\n\r\n\"They _are_ our guineas,\" said Cyril boldly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course we don't know all about that, no more we don't--oh\r\nno--course not! And dragging little gells into it, too. 'Ere--I'll let\r\nthe gells go if you'll come along to the pleece quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't be let go,\" said Jane heroically; \"not without the boys. It's\r\nour money just as much as theirs, you wicked old man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where'd you get it, then?\" said the man, softening slightly, which was\r\nnot at all what the boys expected when Jane began to call names.\r\n\r\nJane cast a silent glance of agony at the others.\r\n\r\n\"Lost your tongue, eh? Got it fast enough when it's for calling names\r\nwith. Come, speak up! Where'd you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of the gravel-pit,\" said truthful Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Next article,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you we did,\" Jane said. \"There's a fairy there--all over brown\r\nfur--with ears like a bat's and eyes like a snail's, and he gives you a\r\nwish a day, and they all come true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Touched in the head, eh?\" said the man in a low voice; \"all the more\r\nshame to you boys dragging the poor afflicted child into your sinful\r\nburglaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's not mad; it's true,\" said Anthea; \"there _is_ a fairy. If I ever\r\nsee him again I'll wish for something for you; at least I would if\r\nvengeance wasn't wicked--so there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor' lumme,\" said Billy Peasemarsh, \"if there ain't another on 'em!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now Willum came back, with a spiteful grin on his face, and at his\r\nback a policeman, with whom Mr. Peasemarsh spoke long in a hoarse\r\nearnest whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I daresay you're right,\" said the policeman at last. \"Anyway, I'll take\r\n'em up on a charge of unlawful possession, pending inquiries. And the\r\nmagistrate will deal with the case. Send the afflicted ones to a home,\r\nas likely as not, and the boys to a reformatory. Now then, come along,\r\nyoungsters! No use making a fuss. You bring the gells along, Mr.\r\nPeasemarsh, sir, and I'll shepherd the boys.\"\r\n\r\nSpeechless with rage and horror, the four children were driven along the\r\nstreets of Rochester. Tears of anger and shame blinded them, so that\r\nwhen Robert ran right into a passer-by he did not recognise her till a\r\nwell-known voice said, \"Well, if ever I did! Oh, Master Robert, whatever\r\nhave you been a-doing of now?\" And another voice, quite as well known,\r\nsaid, \"Panty; want go own Panty!\"\r\n\r\nThey had run into Martha and the Baby!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They had run into Martha and the baby]\r\n\r\nMartha behaved admirably. She refused to believe a word of the\r\npoliceman's story, or of Mr. Peasemarsh's either, even when they made\r\nRobert turn out his pockets in an archway and show the guineas.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see nothing,\" she said. \"You've gone out of your senses, you\r\ntwo! There ain't any gold there--only the poor child's hands, all over\r\ndirt, and like the very chimbley. Oh that I should ever see the day!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the children thought this very noble of Martha, even if rather\r\nwicked, till they remembered how the Fairy had promised that the\r\nservants should never notice any of the fairy gifts. So of course Martha\r\ncouldn't see the gold, and so was only speaking the truth, and that was\r\nquite right, of course, but not extra noble.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dusk when they reached the police-station. The policeman\r\ntold his tale to an inspector, who sat in a large bare room with a thing\r\nlike a clumsy nursery-fender at one end to put prisoners in. Robert\r\nwondered whether it was a cell or a dock.\r\n\r\n\"Produce the coins, officer,\" said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"Turn out your pockets,\" said the constable.\r\n\r\nCyril desperately plunged his hands in his pockets, stood still a\r\nmoment, and then began to laugh--an odd sort of laugh that hurt, and\r\nthat felt much more like crying. His pockets were empty. So were the\r\npockets of the others. For of course at sunset all the fairy gold had\r\nvanished away.\r\n\r\n\"Turn out your pockets, and stop that noise,\" said the inspector.\r\n\r\nCyril turned out his pockets, every one of the nine which enriched his\r\nsuit. And every pocket was empty.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how they done it--artful little beggars! They walked in\r\nfront of me the 'ole way, so as for me to keep my eye on them and not to\r\nattract a crowd and obstruct the traffic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very remarkable,\" said the inspector, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"If you've done a-browbeating of the innocent children,\" said Martha,\r\n\"I'll hire a private carriage and we'll drive home to their papa's\r\nmansion. You'll hear about this again, young man!--I told you they\r\nhadn't got any gold, when you were pretending to see it in their poor\r\nhelpless hands. It's early in the day for a constable on duty not to be\r\nable to trust his own eyes. As to the other one, the less said the\r\nbetter; he keeps the Saracen's Head, and he knows best what his liquor's\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He said, \"Now then!\" to the policeman and Mr. Peasemarsh]\r\n\r\n\"Take them away, for goodness' sake,\" said the inspector crossly. But as\r\nthey left the police-station he said, \"Now then!\" to the policeman and\r\nMr. Peasemarsh, and he said it twenty times as crossly as he had spoken\r\nto Martha.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMartha was as good as her word. She took them home in a very grand\r\ncarriage, because the carrier's cart was gone, and, though she had stood\r\nby them so nobly with the police, she was so angry with them as soon as\r\nthey were alone for \"trapesing into Rochester by themselves,\" that none\r\nof them dared to mention the old man with the pony-cart from the\r\nvillage who was waiting for them in Rochester. And so, after one day of\r\nboundless wealth, the children found themselves sent to bed in deep\r\ndisgrace, and only enriched by two pairs of cotton gloves, dirty inside\r\nbecause of the state of the hands they had been put on to cover, an\r\nimitation crocodile-skin purse, and twelve penny buns, long since\r\ndigested.\r\n\r\nThe thing that troubled them most was the fear that the old gentleman's\r\nguinea might have disappeared at sunset with all the rest, so they went\r\ndown to the village next day to apologise for not meeting him in\r\nRochester, and to _see_. They found him very friendly. The guinea had\r\nnot disappeared, and he had bored a hole in it and hung it on his\r\nwatch-chain. As for the guinea the baker took, the children felt they\r\n_could_ not care whether it had vanished or not, which was not perhaps\r\nvery honest, but on the other hand was not wholly unnatural. But\r\nafterwards this preyed on Anthea's mind, and at last she secretly sent\r\ntwelve postage stamps by post to \"Mr. Beale, Baker, Rochester.\" Inside\r\nshe wrote, \"To pay for the buns.\" I hope the guinea did disappear, for\r\nthat baker was really not at all a nice man, and, besides, penny buns\r\nare seven for sixpence in all really respectable shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBEING WANTED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning after the children had been the possessors of boundless\r\nwealth, and had been unable to buy anything really useful or enjoyable\r\nwith it, except two pairs of cotton gloves, twelve penny buns, an\r\nimitation crocodile-skin purse, and a ride in a pony-cart, they awoke\r\nwithout any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on the\r\nprevious day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a\r\nPsammead, or Sand-fairy, and to receive its promise to grant them a new\r\nwish every day. For now they had had two wishes, Beauty and Wealth, and\r\nneither had exactly made them happy. But the happening of strange\r\nthings, even if they are not completely pleasant things, is more amusing\r\nthan those times when nothing happens but meals, and they are not always\r\ncompletely pleasant, especially on the days when it is cold mutton or\r\nhash.\r\n\r\nThere was no chance of talking things over before breakfast, because\r\neveryone overslept itself, as it happened, and it needed a vigorous and\r\ndetermined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late for\r\nbreakfast. During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the\r\nquestion of the Psammead in an impartial spirit, but it is very\r\ndifficult to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend\r\nfaithfully to your baby brother's breakfast needs. The Baby was\r\nparticularly lively that morning. He not only wriggled his body through\r\nthe bar of his high chair, and hung by his head, choking and purple, but\r\nhe seized a tablespoon with desperate suddenness, hit Cyril heavily on\r\nthe head with it, and then cried because it was taken away from him. He\r\nput his fat fist in his bread-and-milk, and demanded \"nam,\" which was\r\nonly allowed for tea. He sang, he put his feet on the table--he\r\nclamoured to \"go walky.\" The conversation was something like this--\r\n\r\n\"Look here--about that Sand-fairy---- Look out!--he'll have the milk\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nMilk removed to a safe distance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--about that Fairy---- No, Lamb dear, give Panther the narky poon.\"\r\n\r\nThen Cyril tried. \"Nothing we've had yet has turned out---- He nearly\r\nhad the mustard that time!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder whether we'd better wish---- Hullo!--you've done it now, my\r\nboy!\" And in a flash of glass and pink baby-paws, the bowl of golden\r\ncarp in the middle of the table rolled on its side and poured a flood of\r\nmixed water and gold-fish into the Baby's lap and into the laps of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nEveryone was almost as much upset as the gold-fish; the Lamb only\r\nremaining calm. When the pool on the floor had been mopped up, and the\r\nleaping, gasping gold-fish had been collected and put back in the water,\r\nthe Baby was taken away to be entirely re-dressed by Martha, and most of\r\nthe others had to change completely. The pinafores and jackets that had\r\nbeen bathed in gold-fish-and-water were hung out to dry, and then it\r\nturned out that Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day\r\nbefore or appear all day in her best petticoat. It was white and soft\r\nand frilly, and trimmed with lace, and very, very pretty, quite as\r\npretty as a frock, if not more so. Only it was _not_ a frock, and\r\nMartha's word was law. She wouldn't let Jane wear her best frock, and\r\nshe refused to listen for a moment to Robert's suggestion that Jane\r\nshould wear her best petticoat and call it a dress.\r\n\r\n\"It's not respectable,\" she said. And when people say that, it's no use\r\nanyone's saying anything. You'll find this out for yourselves some day.\r\n\r\nSo there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock. The hole had\r\nbeen torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High\r\nStreet of Rochester, just where a water-cart had passed on its silvery\r\nway. She had grazed her knee, and her stocking was much more than\r\ngrazed, and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to\r\nthe knee and the stocking. Of course the others were not such sneaks as\r\nto abandon a comrade in misfortune, so they all sat on the grass-plot\r\nround the sun-dial, and Jane darned away for dear life. The Lamb was\r\nstill in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed, so conversation\r\nwas possible.\r\n\r\nAnthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought, which\r\nwas that the Psammead was not to be trusted; but Cyril said--\r\n\r\n\"Speak out--say what you've got to say--I hate hinting, and 'don't\r\nknow,' and sneakish ways like that.\"\r\n\r\nSo then Robert said, as in honour bound, \"Sneak yourself--Anthea and me\r\nweren't so gold-fishy as you two were, so we got changed quicker, and\r\nwe've had time to think it over, and if you ask me\"--\r\n\r\n\"I didn't ask you,\" said Jane, biting off a needleful of thread as she\r\nhad always been strictly forbidden to do. (Perhaps you don't know that\r\nif you bite off ends of cotton and swallow them they wind tight round\r\nyour heart and kill you? My nurse told me this, and she told me also\r\nabout the earth going round the sun. Now what is one to believe--what\r\nwith nurses and science?)\r\n\r\n\"I don't care who asks or who doesn't,\" said Robert, \"but Anthea and I\r\nthink the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute. If it can give us our wishes I\r\nsuppose it can give itself its own, and I feel almost sure it wishes\r\nevery time that our wishes shan't do us any good. Let's let the tiresome\r\nbeast alone, and just go and have a jolly good game of forts, on our\r\nown, in the chalk-pit.\"\r\n\r\n(You will remember that the happily-situated house where these children\r\nwere spending their holidays lay between a chalk-quarry and a\r\ngravel-pit.)\r\n\r\nCyril and Jane were more hopeful--they generally were.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the Sammyadd does it on purpose,\" Cyril said; \"and, after\r\nall, it _was_ silly to wish for boundless wealth. Fifty pounds in\r\ntwo-shilling pieces would have been much more sensible. And wishing to\r\nbe beautiful as the day was simply donkeyish. I don't want to be\r\ndisagreeable, but it _was_. We must try to find a really useful wish,\r\nand wish it.\"\r\n\r\nJane dropped her work and said--\r\n\r\n\"I think so too, it's too silly to have a chance like this and not use\r\nit. I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a chance;\r\nthere must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that wouldn't\r\nturn out Dead Sea fish, like these two things have. Do let's think hard\r\nand wish something nice, so that we can have a real jolly day--what\r\nthere is left of it.\"\r\n\r\nJane darned away again like mad, for time was indeed getting on, and\r\neveryone began to talk at once. If you had been there you could not\r\npossibly have made head or tail of the talk, but these children were\r\nused to talking \"by fours,\" as soldiers march, and each of them could\r\nsay what it had to say quite comfortably, and listen to the agreeable\r\nsound of its own voice, and at the same time have three-quarters of two\r\nsharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said. That is an\r\neasy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions, but, as I daresay\r\nyou can't do even that, I won't ask you to tell me whether 3/4 × 2 =\r\n1-1/2, but I will ask you to believe me that this was the amount of ear\r\neach child was able to lend to the others. Lending ears was common in\r\nRoman times, as we learn from Shakespeare; but I fear I am getting too\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nWhen the frock was darned, the start for the gravel-pit was delayed by\r\nMartha's insisting on everybody's washing its hands--which was nonsense,\r\nbecause nobody had been doing anything at all, except Jane, and how can\r\nyou get dirty doing nothing? That is a difficult question, and I cannot\r\nanswer it on paper. In real life I could very soon show you--or you me,\r\nwhich is much more likely.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation in which the six ears were lent (there were four\r\nchildren, so _that_ sum comes right), it had been decided that fifty\r\npounds in two-shilling pieces was the right wish to have. And the lucky\r\nchildren, who could have anything in the wide world by just wishing for\r\nit, hurriedly started for the gravel-pit to express their wishes to the\r\nPsammead. Martha caught them at the gate, and insisted on their taking\r\nthe Baby with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The lucky children ... hurriedly started for the gravel\r\npit]\r\n\r\n\"Not want him indeed! Why, everybody 'ud want him, a duck! with all\r\ntheir hearts they would; and you know you promised your ma to take him\r\nout every blessed day,\" said Martha.\r\n\r\n\"I know we did,\" said Robert in gloom, \"but I wish the Lamb wasn't quite\r\nso young and small. It would be much better fun taking him out.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll mend of his youngness with time,\" said Martha; \"and as for\r\nsmallness, I don't think you'd fancy carrying of him any more, however\r\nbig he was. Besides he can walk a bit, bless his precious fat legs, a\r\nducky! He feels the benefit of the new-laid air, so he does, a pet!\"\r\n\r\nWith this and a kiss, she plumped the Lamb into Anthea's arms, and went\r\nback to make new pinafores on the sewing-machine. She was a rapid\r\nperformer on this instrument.\r\n\r\nThe Lamb laughed with pleasure, and said, \"Walky wif Panty,\" and rode on\r\nRobert's back with yells of joy, and tried to feed Jane with stones,\r\nand altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could long be sorry\r\nthat he was of the party.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic Jane even suggested that they should devote a week's\r\nwishes to assuring the Baby's future, by asking such gifts for him as\r\nthe good fairies give to Infant Princes in proper fairy-tales, but\r\nAnthea soberly reminded her that as the Sand-fairy's wishes only lasted\r\ntill sunset they could not ensure any benefit to the Baby's later years;\r\nand Jane owned that it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in\r\ntwo-shilling pieces, and buy the Lamb a three-pound fifteen\r\nrocking-horse, like those in the big stores, with a part of the money.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that, as soon as they had wished for the money and got\r\nit, they would get Mr. Crispin to drive them into Rochester again,\r\ntaking Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her. And\r\nthey would make a list of things they really wanted before they started.\r\nFull of high hopes and excellent resolutions, they went round the safe\r\nslow cart-road to the gravel-pits, and as they went in between the\r\nmounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them, and would have turned\r\ntheir ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a book. Being real\r\nlive children, it only made them stop and look at each other with rather\r\nblank and silly expressions. For now they remembered that yesterday,\r\nwhen they had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth, and it was\r\ngetting ready to fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright\r\nguineas--millions of them--it had told the children to run along outside\r\nthe quarry for fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid\r\ntreasure. And they had run. And so it happened that they had not had\r\ntime to mark the spot where the Psammead was, with a ring of stones, as\r\nbefore. And it was this thought that put such silly expressions on their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said the hopeful Jane, \"we'll soon find him.\"\r\n\r\nBut this, though easily said, was hard in the doing. They looked and\r\nthey looked, and, though they found their seaside spades, nowhere could\r\nthey find the Sand-fairy.\r\n\r\nAt last they had to sit down and rest--not at all because they were\r\nweary or disheartened, of course, but because the Lamb insisted on being\r\nput down, and you cannot look very carefully after anything you may have\r\nhappened to lose in the sand if you have an active baby to look after at\r\nthe same time. Get someone to drop your best knife in the sand next time\r\nyou go to the seashore and then take your baby brother with you when you\r\ngo to look for it, and you will see that I am right.\r\n\r\nThe Lamb, as Martha had said, was feeling the benefit of the country\r\nair, and he was as frisky as a sandhopper. The elder ones longed to go\r\non talking about the new wishes they would have when (or if) they found\r\nthe Psammead again. But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself.\r\n\r\nHe watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into Anthea's\r\nface, and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand and waved his\r\nfat legs in the air. Then of course the sand got into his eyes, as it\r\nhad into Anthea's, and he howled.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of ginger-beer\r\nwith him, relying on a thirst that had never yet failed him. This had to\r\nbe uncorked hurriedly--it was the only wet thing within reach, and it\r\nwas necessary to wash the sand out of the Lamb's eyes somehow. Of course\r\nthe ginger hurt horribly, and he howled more than ever. And, amid his\r\nanguish of kicking, the bottle was upset and the beautiful ginger-beer\r\nfrothed out into the sand and was lost for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Robert, usually a very patient brother, so far forgot\r\nhimself as to say--\r\n\r\n\"Anybody would want him, indeed! Only they don't; Martha doesn't, not\r\nreally, or she'd jolly well keep him with her. He's a little nuisance,\r\nthat's what he is. It's too bad. I only wish everybody _did_ want him\r\nwith all their hearts; we might get some peace in our lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lamb stopped howling now, because Jane had suddenly remembered that\r\nthere is only one safe way of taking things out of little children's\r\neyes, and that is with your own soft wet tongue. It is quite easy if you\r\nlove the Baby as much as you ought to do.\r\n\r\nThen there was a little silence. Robert was not proud of himself for\r\nhaving been so cross, and the others were not proud of him either. You\r\noften notice that sort of silence when someone has said something it\r\nought not to--and everyone else holds its tongue and waits for the one\r\nwho oughtn't to have said it is sorry.\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken by a sigh--a breath suddenly let out. The\r\nchildren's heads turned as if there had been a string tied to each nose,\r\nand somebody had pulled all the strings at once.\r\n\r\nAnd everyone saw the Sand-fairy sitting quite close to them, with the\r\nexpression which it used as a smile on its hairy face.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning,\" it said; \"I did that quite easily! Everyone wants him\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Robert sulkily, because he knew he had been\r\nbehaving rather like a pig. \"No matter who wants him--there's no one\r\nhere to--anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ingratitude,\" said the Psammead, \"is a dreadful vice.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not ungrateful,\" Jane made haste to say, \"but we didn't _really_\r\nwant that wish. Robert only just said it. Can't you take it back and\r\ngive us a new one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I can't,\" the Sand-fairy said shortly; \"chopping and changing--it's\r\nnot business. You ought to be careful what you _do_ wish. There was a\r\nlittle boy once, he'd wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an\r\nIchthyosaurus, because he was too lazy to remember the easy names of\r\neveryday things, and his father had been very vexed with him, and had\r\nmade him go to bed before tea-time, and wouldn't let him go out in the\r\nnice flint boat along with the other children,--it was the annual\r\nschool-treat next day,--and he came and flung himself down near me on\r\nthe morning of the treat, and he kicked his little prehistoric legs\r\nabout and said he wished he was dead. And of course then he was.\"\r\n\r\n\"How awful! said the children all together.\r\n\r\n\"Only till sunset, of course,\" the Psammead said; \"still it was quite\r\nenough for his father and mother. And he caught it when he woke up--I\r\ntell you. He didn't turn to stone--I forget why--but there must have\r\nbeen some reason. They didn't know being dead is only being asleep, and\r\nyou're bound to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep\r\nor in some better place. You may be sure he caught it, giving them such\r\na turn. Why, he wasn't allowed to taste Megatherium for a month after\r\nthat. Nothing but oysters and periwinkles, and common things like that.\"\r\n\r\nAll the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale. They looked\r\nat the Psammead in horror. Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something\r\nbrown and furry was near him.\r\n\r\n\"Poof, poof, poofy,\" he said, and made a grab.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Poof, poof, poofy,\" he said, and made a grab]\r\n\r\n\"It's not a pussy,\" Anthea was beginning, when the Sand-fairy leaped\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my left whisker!\" it said; \"don't let him touch me. He's wet.\"\r\n\r\nIts fur stood on end with horror--and indeed a good deal of the\r\nginger-beer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb.\r\n\r\nThe Psammead dug with its hands and feet, and vanished in an instant and\r\na whirl of sand.\r\n\r\nThe children marked the spot with a ring of stones.\r\n\r\n\"We may as well get along home,\" said Robert. \"I'll say I'm sorry; but\r\nanyway if it's no good it's no harm, and we know where the sandy thing\r\nis for to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe others were noble. No one reproached Robert at all. Cyril picked up\r\nthe Lamb, who was now quite himself again, and off they went by the safe\r\ncart-road.\r\n\r\nThe cart-road from the gravel-pits joins the road almost directly.\r\n\r\nAt the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from\r\nCyril's back to Robert's. And as they paused a very smart open carriage\r\ncame in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside the\r\ncarriage a lady--very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace and\r\nred ribbons and a parasol all red and white--and a white fluffy dog on\r\nher lap with a red ribbon round its neck. She looked at the children,\r\nand particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him. The children were\r\nused to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a \"very taking\r\nchild.\" So they waved their hands politely to the lady and expected her\r\nto drive on. But she did not. Instead she made the coachman stop. And\r\nshe beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the carriage she said--\r\n\r\n\"What a dear darling duck of a baby! Oh, I _should_ so like to adopt it!\r\nDo you think its mother would mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"She'd mind very much indeed,\" said Anthea shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I should bring it up in luxury, you know. I am Lady Chittenden.\r\nYou must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers. They call me\r\na Beauty, you know, but of course that's all nonsense. Anyway\"--\r\n\r\nShe opened the carriage door and jumped out. She had the wonderfullest\r\nred high-heeled shoes with silver buckles. \"Let me hold him a minute,\"\r\nshe said. And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly, as if she\r\nwas not used to babies.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and\r\nslammed the door, and said, \"Drive on!\"\r\n\r\nThe Lamb roared, the little white dog barked, and the coachman\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Drive on, I tell you!\" cried the lady; and the coachman did, for, as he\r\nsaid afterwards, it was as much as his place was worth not to.\r\n\r\nThe four children looked at each other, and then with one accord they\r\nrushed after the carriage and held on behind. Down the dusty road went\r\nthe smart carriage, and after it, at double-quick time, ran the\r\ntwinkling legs of the Lamb's brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At double-quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the\r\nLamb's brothers and sisters]\r\n\r\nThe Lamb howled louder and louder, but presently his howls changed by\r\nslow degrees to hiccupy gurgles, and then all was still, and they knew\r\nhe had gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe carriage went on, and the eight feet that twinkled through the\r\ndust were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at\r\nthe lodge of a grand park. The children crouched down behind the\r\ncarriage, and the lady got out. She looked at the Baby as it lay on the\r\ncarriage seat, and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"The darling--I won't disturb it,\" she said, and went into the lodge to\r\ntalk to the woman there about a setting of eggs that had not turned out\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping\r\nLamb.\r\n\r\n\"Fine boy--wish he was mine,\" said the coachman.\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't favour _you_ much,\" said the groom sourly; \"too 'andsome.\"\r\n\r\nThe coachman pretended not to hear. He said--\r\n\r\n\"Wonder at her now--I do really! Hates kids. Got none of her own, and\r\ncan't abide other folkses'.\"\r\n\r\nThe children, crouched in the white dust under the carriage, exchanged\r\nuncomfortable glances.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you what,\" the coachman went on firmly, \"blowed if I don't hide\r\nthe little nipper in the hedge and tell her his brothers took 'im! Then\r\nI'll come back for him afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't,\" said the footman. \"I've took to that kid so as never\r\nwas. If anyone's to have him, it's me--so there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop your talk!\" the coachman rejoined. \"You don't want no kids, and,\r\nif you did, one kid's the same as another to you. But I'm a married man\r\nand a judge of breed. I knows a firstrate yearling when I sees him. I'm\r\na-goin' to 'ave him, an' least said soonest mended.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should 'a' thought,\" said the footman sneeringly, \"you'd a'most\r\nenough. What with Alfred, an' Albert, an' Louise, an' Victor Stanley,\r\nand Helena Beatrice, and another\"--\r\n\r\nThe coachman hit the footman in the chin--the footman hit the coachman\r\nin the waist-coat--the next minute the two were fighting here and there,\r\nin and out, up and down, and all over everywhere, and the little dog\r\njumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The next minute the two were fighting]\r\n\r\nCyril, still crouching in the dust, waddled on bent legs to the side of\r\nthe carriage farthest from the battlefield. He unfastened the door of\r\nthe carriage--the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel\r\nto notice anything--took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping,\r\ncarried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile\r\nled into a wood. The others followed, and there among the hazels and\r\nyoung oaks and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong-scented\r\nbrake-fern, they all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were\r\nhushed at the angry voice of the red-and-white lady, and, after a long\r\nand anxious search, the carriage at last drove away.\r\n\r\n\"My only hat!\" said Cyril, drawing a deep breath as the sound of wheels\r\nat last died away. \"Everyone _does_ want him now--and no mistake! That\r\nSammyadd has done us again! Tricky brute! For any sake, let's get the\r\nkid safe home.\"\r\n\r\nSo they peeped out, and finding on the right hand only lonely white\r\nroad, and nothing but lonely white road on the left, they took courage,\r\nand the road, Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb.\r\n\r\nAdventures dogged their footsteps. A boy with a bundle of faggots on his\r\nback dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby,\r\nand then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way\r\ntwice. They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert\r\ncouldn't make him go away till they had more than once invited him to\r\nsmell their fists. Afterwards a little girl in a blue-and-white checked\r\npinafore actually followed them for a quarter of a mile crying for \"the\r\nprecious Baby,\" and then she was only got rid of by threats of tying her\r\nto a tree in the wood with all their pocket handkerchiefs. \"So that\r\nbears can come and eat you as soon as it gets dark,\" said Cyril\r\nseverely. Then she went off crying. It presently seemed wise, to the\r\nbrothers and sisters of the Baby who was wanted by everyone, to hide in\r\nthe hedge whenever they saw anyone coming, and thus they managed to\r\nprevent the Lamb from arousing the inconvenient affection of a milkman,\r\na stone-breaker, and a man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at\r\nthe back of it. They were nearly home when the worst thing of all\r\nhappened. Turning a corner suddenly they came upon two vans, a tent, and\r\na company of gipsies encamped by the side of the road. The vans were\r\nhung all round with wicker chairs and cradles, and flower-stands and\r\nfeather brushes. A lot of ragged children were industriously making\r\ndust-pies in the road, two men lay on the grass smoking, and three women\r\nwere doing the family washing in an old red watering-can with the top\r\nbroken off.\r\n\r\nIn a moment every gipsy, men, women, and children, surrounded Anthea and\r\nthe Baby.\r\n\r\n\"Let me hold him, little lady,\" said one of the gipsy women, who had a\r\nmahogany-coloured face and dust-coloured hair; \"I won't hurt a hair of\r\nhis head, the little picture!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather not,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Let _me_ have him,\" said the other woman, whose face was also of the\r\nhue of mahogany, and her hair jet-black, in greasy curls. \"I've nineteen\r\nof my own, so I have\"--\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Anthea bravely, but her heart beat so that it nearly choked\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThen one of the men pushed forward.\r\n\r\n\"Swelp me if it ain't!\" he cried, \"my own long-lost cheild! Have he a\r\nstrawberry mark on his left ear? No? Then he's my own babby, stolen from\r\nme in hinnocent hinfancy. 'And 'im over--and we'll not 'ave the law on\r\nyer this time.\"\r\n\r\nHe snatched the Baby from Anthea, who turned scarlet and burst into\r\ntears of pure rage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He snatched the baby from Anthea]\r\n\r\nThe others were standing quite still; this was much the most terrible\r\nthing that had ever happened to them. Even being taken up by the police\r\nin Rochester was nothing to this. Cyril was quite white, and his hands\r\ntrembled a little, but he made a sign to the others to shut up. He was\r\nsilent a minute, thinking hard. Then he said--\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to keep him if he's yours. But you see he's used to us.\r\nYou shall have him if you want him\"--\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" cried Anthea,--and Cyril glared at her.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we want him,\" said the women, trying to get the Baby out of\r\nthe man's arms. The Lamb howled loudly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's hurt!\" shrieked Anthea; and Cyril, in a savage undertone, bade\r\nher \"stop it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You trust to me,\" he whispered. \"Look here,\" he went on, \"he's awfully\r\ntiresome with people he doesn't know very well. Suppose we stay here a\r\nbit till he gets used to you, and then when it's bedtime I give you my\r\nword of honour we'll go away and let you keep him if you want to. And\r\nthen when we're gone you can decide which of you is to have him, as you\r\nall want him so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's fair enough,\" said the man who was holding the Baby, trying to\r\nloosen the red neckerchief which the Lamb had caught hold of and drawn\r\nround his mahogany throat so tight that he could hardly breathe. The\r\ngipsies whispered together, and Cyril took the chance to whisper too. He\r\nsaid, \"Sunset! we'll get away then.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then his brothers and sisters were filled with wonder and admiration\r\nat his having been so clever as to remember this.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do let him come to us!\" said Jane. \"See, we'll sit down here and\r\ntake care of him for you till he gets used to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about dinner?\" said Robert suddenly. The others looked at him with\r\nscorn. \"Fancy bothering about your beastly dinner when your br--I mean\r\nwhen the Baby\"--Jane whispered hotly. Robert carefully winked at her and\r\nwent on--\r\n\r\n\"You won't mind my just running home to get our dinner?\" he said to the\r\ngipsy; \"I can bring it out here in a basket.\"\r\n\r\nHis brothers and sisters felt themselves very noble and despised him.\r\nThey did not know his thoughtful secret intention. But the gipsies did\r\nin a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" they said; \"and then fetch the police with a pack of lies\r\nabout it being your baby instead of ours! D'jever catch a weasel\r\nasleep?\" they asked.\r\n\r\n\"If you're hungry you can pick a bit along of us,\" said the light-haired\r\ngipsy-woman, not unkindly. \"Here Levi, that blessed kid'll howl all his\r\nbuttons off. Give him to the little lady, and let's see if they can't\r\nget him used to us a bit.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Lamb was handed back; but the gipsies crowded so closely that he\r\ncould not possibly stop howling. Then the man with the red handkerchief\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Here, Pharaoh, make up the fire; and you girls see to the pot. Give the\r\nkid a chanst.\" So the gipsies, very much against their will, went off to\r\ntheir work, and the children and the Lamb were left sitting on the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be all right at sunset,\" Jane whispered. \"But, oh, it is awful!\r\nSuppose they are frightfully angry when they come to their senses! They\r\nmight beat us, or leave us tied to trees, or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they won't,\" Anthea said (\"Oh, my Lamb, don't cry any more, it's\r\nall right, Panty's got oo, duckie\"); \"they aren't unkind people, or they\r\nwouldn't be going to give us any dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner?\" said Robert; \"I won't touch their nasty dinner. It would choke\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nThe others thought so too then. But when the dinner was ready--it turned\r\nout to be supper, and happened between four and five--they were all glad\r\nenough to take what they could get. It was boiled rabbit, with onions,\r\nand some bird rather like a chicken, but stringier about its legs and\r\nwith a stronger taste. The Lamb had bread soaked in hot water and brown\r\nsugar sprinkled on the top. He liked this very much, and consented to\r\nlet the two gipsy women feed him with it, as he sat on Anthea's lap. All\r\nthat long hot afternoon Robert and Cyril and Anthea and Jane had to keep\r\nthe Lamb amused and happy, while the gipsies looked eagerly on. By the\r\ntime the shadows grew long and black across the meadows he had really\r\n\"taken to\" the woman with the light hair, and even consented to kiss\r\nhis hand to the children, and to stand up and bow, with his hand on his\r\nchest--\"like a gentleman\"--to the two men. The whole gipsy camp was in\r\nraptures with him, and his brothers and sisters could not help taking\r\nsome pleasure in showing off his accomplishments to an audience so\r\ninterested and enthusiastic. But they longed for sunset.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He consented to let the two gypsy women feed him]\r\n\r\n\"We're getting into the habit of longing for sunset,\" Cyril whispered.\r\n\"How I do wish we could wish something really sensible, that would be of\r\nsome use, so that we should be quite sorry when sunset came.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadows got longer and longer, and at last there were no separate\r\nshadows any more, but one soft glowing shadow over everything; for the\r\nsun was out of sight--behind the hill--but he had not really set yet.\r\nThe people who make the laws about lighting bicycle lamps are the people\r\nwho decide when the sun sets; she has to do it too, to the minute, or\r\nthey would know the reason why!\r\n\r\nBut the gipsies were getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\"Now, young uns,\" the red-handkerchief man said, \"it's time you were\r\nlaying of your heads on your pillowses--so it is! The kid's all right\r\nand friendly with us now--so you just hand him over and get home like\r\nyou said.\"\r\n\r\nThe women and children came crowding round the Lamb, arms were held out,\r\nfingers snapped invitingly, friendly faces beaming with admiring smiles;\r\nbut all failed to tempt the loyal Lamb. He clung with arms and legs to\r\nJane, who happened to be holding him, and uttered the gloomiest roar of\r\nthe whole day.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good,\" the woman said, \"hand the little poppet over, miss.\r\nWe'll soon quiet him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd still the sun would not set.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her about how to put him to bed,\" whispered Cyril; \"anything to\r\ngain time--and be ready to bolt when the sun really does make up its\r\nsilly old mind to set.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll hand him over in just one minute,\" Anthea began, talking very\r\nfast,--\"but do let me just tell you he has a warm bath every night and\r\ncold in the morning, and he has a crockery rabbit to go into the warm\r\nbath with him, and little Samuel saying his prayers in white china on a\r\nred cushion for the cold bath; and he hates you to wash his ears, but\r\nyou must; and if you let the soap get into his eyes, the Lamb\"--\r\n\r\n\"Lamb kyes,\" said he--he had stopped roaring to listen.\r\n\r\nThe woman laughed. \"As if I hadn't never bath'd a babby!\" she said.\r\n\"Come--give us a hold of him. Come to 'Melia, my precious\"--\r\n\r\n\"G'way, ugsie!\" replied the Lamb at once.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but,\" Anthea went on, \"about his meals; you really _must_ let me\r\ntell you he has an apple or banana every morning, and bread and milk for\r\nbreakfast, and an egg for his tea sometimes, and\"--\r\n\r\n\"I've brought up ten,\" said the black ringleted woman, \"besides the\r\nothers. Come, miss, 'and 'im over--I can't bear it no longer. I just\r\nmust give him a hug.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ain't settled yet whose he's to be, Esther,\" said one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"It won't be you, Esther, with seven of 'em at your tail a'ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't so sure of that,\" said Esther's husband.\r\n\r\n\"And ain't I nobody, to have a say neither?\" said the husband of 'Melia.\r\n\r\nZillah, the girl, said, \"An' me? I'm a single girl--and no one but 'im\r\nto look after--I ought to have him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut your mouth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you show me no more of your imperence!\"\r\n\r\nEveryone was getting very angry. The dark gipsy faces were frowning and\r\nanxious-looking. Suddenly a change swept over them, as if some invisible\r\nsponge had wiped away these cross and anxious expressions, and left only\r\na blank.\r\n\r\nThe children saw that the sun really _had_ set. But they were afraid to\r\nmove. And the gipsies were feeling so muddled because of the invisible\r\nsponge that had washed all the feelings of the last few hours out of\r\ntheir hearts, that they could not say a word.\r\n\r\nThe children hardly dared to breathe. Suppose the gipsies, when they\r\nrecovered speech, should be furious to think how silly they had been all\r\nday?\r\n\r\nIt was an awkward moment. Suddenly Anthea, greatly daring, held out the\r\nLamb to the red-handkerchief man.\r\n\r\n\"Here he is!\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe man drew back. \"I shouldn't like to deprive you, miss,\" he said\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone who likes can have my share of him,\" said the other man.\r\n\r\n\"After all, I've got enough of my own,\" said Esther.\r\n\r\n\"He's a nice little chap, though,\" said Amelia. She was the only one who\r\nnow looked affectionately at the whimpering Lamb.\r\n\r\nZillah said, \"If I don't think I must have had a touch of the sun. _I_\r\ndon't want him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then shall we take him away?\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Well--suppose you do,\" said Pharaoh heartily, \"and we'll say no more\r\nabout it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with great haste all the gipsies began to be busy about their tents\r\nfor the night. All but Amelia. She went with the children as far as the\r\nbend in the road--and there she said--\r\n\r\n\"Let me give him a kiss, miss,--I don't know what made us go for to\r\nbehave so silly. Us gipsies don't steal babies, whatever they may tell\r\nyou when you're naughty. We've enough of our own, mostly. But I've lost\r\nall mine.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned towards the Lamb; and he, looking in her eyes, unexpectedly\r\nput up a grubby soft paw and stroked her face.\r\n\r\n\"Poor, poor!\" said the Lamb. And he let the gipsy woman kiss him, and,\r\nwhat is more, he kissed her brown cheek in return--a very nice kiss, as\r\nall his kisses are, and not a wet one like some babies give. The gipsy\r\nwoman moved her finger about on his forehead as if she had been writing\r\nsomething there, and the same with his chest and his hands and his\r\nfeet; then she said--\r\n\r\n\"May he be brave, and have the strong head to think with, and the strong\r\nheart to love with, and the strong arms to work with, and the strong\r\nfeet to travel with, and always come safe home to his own.\" Then she\r\nsaid something in a strange language no one could understand, and\r\nsuddenly added--\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must be saying 'so long'--and glad to have made your\r\nacquaintance.\" And she turned and went back to her home--the tent by the\r\ngrassy roadside.\r\n\r\nThe children looked after her till she was out of sight. Then Robert\r\nsaid, \"How silly of her! Even sunset didn't put _her_ right. What rot\r\nshe talked!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cyril, \"if you ask me, I think it was rather decent of\r\nher\"--\r\n\r\n\"Decent?\" said Anthea; \"it was very nice indeed of her. I think she's a\r\ndear\"--\r\n\r\n\"She's just too frightfully nice for anything,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\nAnd they went home--very late for tea and unspeakably late for dinner.\r\nMartha scolded, of course. But the Lamb was safe.\r\n\r\n\"I say--it turned out we wanted the Lamb as much as anyone,\" said\r\nRobert, later.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you feel different about it now the sun's set?\"\r\n\r\n\"_No_,\" said all the others together.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's lasted over sunset with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it hasn't,\" Cyril explained. \"The wish didn't do anything to _us_.\r\nWe always wanted him with all our hearts when we were our proper selves,\r\nonly we were all pigs this morning; especially you, Robert.\" Robert bore\r\nthis much with a strange calm.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly _thought_ I didn't want him this morning,\" said he.\r\n\"Perhaps I _was_ a pig. But everything looked so different when we\r\nthought we were going to lose him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that, my dear children, is the moral of this chapter. I did not mean\r\nit to have a moral, but morals are nasty forward beings, and will keep\r\nputting in their oars where they are not wanted. And since the moral has\r\ncrept in, quite against my wishes, you might as well think of it next\r\ntime you feel piggy yourself and want to get rid of any of your brothers\r\nand sisters. I hope this doesn't often happen, but I daresay it has\r\nhappened sometimes, even to you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was very wet--too wet to go out, and far too wet to think\r\nof disturbing a Sand-fairy so sensitive to water that he still, after\r\nthousands of years, felt the pain of once having his left whisker\r\nwetted. It was a long day, and it was not till the afternoon that all\r\nthe children suddenly decided to write letters to their mother. It was\r\nRobert who had the misfortune to upset the ink well--an unusually deep\r\nand full one--straight into that part of Anthea's desk where she had\r\nlong pretended that an arrangement of mucilage and cardboard painted\r\nwith Indian ink was a secret drawer. It was not exactly Robert's fault;\r\nit was only his misfortune that he chanced to be lifting the ink across\r\nthe desk just at the moment when Anthea had got it open, and that that\r\nsame moment should have been the one chosen by the Lamb to get under\r\nthe table and break his squeaking bird. There was a sharp convenient\r\nwire inside the bird, and of course the Lamb ran the wire into Robert's\r\nleg at once; and so, without anyone's meaning to do it the secret drawer\r\nwas flooded with ink. At the same time a stream was poured over Anthea's\r\nhalf-finished letter.\r\n\r\nSo that her letter was something like this--\r\n\r\n          \"DARLING MOTHER,--I hope you are quite well, and I\r\n          hope Granny is better. The other day we....\"\r\n\r\nThen came a flood of ink, and at the bottom these words in pencil--\r\n\r\n          \"It was not me upset the ink, but it took such a\r\n          time clearing up, so no more as it is\r\n          post-time.--From your loving daughter     \"ANTHEA.\"\r\n\r\nRobert's letter had not even been begun. He had been drawing a ship on\r\nthe blotting paper while he was trying to think of what to say. And of\r\ncourse after the ink was upset he had to help Anthea to clean out her\r\ndesk, and he promised to make her another secret drawer, better than\r\nthe other. And she said, \"Well, make it now.\" So it was post-time and\r\nhis letter wasn't done. And the secret drawer wasn't done either.\r\n\r\nCyril wrote a long letter, very fast, and then went to set a trap for\r\nslugs that he had read about in the _Home-made Gardener_, and when it\r\nwas post-time the letter could not be found, and it was never found.\r\nPerhaps the slugs ate it.\r\n\r\nJane's letter was the only one that went. She meant to tell her mother\r\nall about the Psammead,--in fact they had all meant to do this,--but she\r\nspent so long thinking how to spell the word that there was no time to\r\ntell the story properly, and it is useless to tell a story unless you\r\n_do_ tell it properly, so she had to be contented with this--\r\n\r\n          \"MY DEAR MOTHER DEAR,--We are all as good as we\r\n          can, like you told us to, and the Lamb has a\r\n          little cold, but Martha says it is nothing, only\r\n          he upset the gold-fish into himself yesterday\r\n          morning. When we were up at the sand-pit the other\r\n          day we went round by the safe way where carts go,\r\n          and we found  a\"--\r\n\r\nHalf an hour went by before Jane felt quite sure that they could none of\r\nthem spell Psammead. And they could not find it in the dictionary\r\neither, though they looked. Then Jane hastily finished her letter--\r\n\r\n          \"We found a strange thing, but it is nearly\r\n          post-time, so no more at present from your little\r\n          girl,\r\n\r\n                                                   \"JANE.\r\n\r\n          \"P.S.--If you could have a wish come true what\r\n          would you have?\"\r\n\r\nThen the postman was heard blowing his horn, and Robert rushed out in\r\nthe rain to stop his cart and give him the letters. And that was how it\r\nhappened that, though all the children meant to tell their mother about\r\nthe Sand-fairy, somehow or other she never got to know. There were other\r\nreasons why she never got to know, but these come later.\r\n\r\nThe next day Uncle Richard came and took them all to Maidstone in a\r\nwagonette--all except the Lamb. Uncle Richard was the very best kind of\r\nuncle. He bought them toys at Maidstone. He took them into a shop and\r\nlet them all choose exactly what they wanted, without any restrictions\r\nabout price, and no nonsense about things being instructive. It is very\r\nwise to let children choose exactly what they like, because they are\r\nvery foolish and inexperienced, and sometimes they will choose a really\r\ninstructive thing without meaning to do so. This happened to Robert, who\r\nchose, at the last moment, and in a great hurry, a box with pictures on\r\nit of winged bulls with men's heads and winged men with eagles' heads.\r\nHe thought there would be animals inside, the same as on the box. When\r\nhe got it home it was a Sunday puzzle about ancient Nineveh! The others\r\nchose in haste, and were happy at leisure. Cyril had a model engine, and\r\nthe girls had two dolls, as well as a china tea-set with forget-me-nots\r\non it, to be \"between them.\" The boys' \"between them\" was bow and arrow.\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Richard took them on the beautiful Medway in a boat, and then\r\nthey all had tea at a beautiful confectioner's and when they reached\r\nhome it was far too late to have any wishes that day.\r\n\r\nThey did not tell Uncle Richard anything about the Psammead. I do not\r\nknow why. And they do not know why. But I daresay you can guess.\r\n\r\nThe day after Uncle Richard had behaved so handsomely was a very hot day\r\nindeed. The people who decide what the weather is to be, and put its\r\norders down for it in the newspapers every morning, said afterwards that\r\nit was the hottest day there had been for years. They had ordered it to\r\nbe \"warmer--some showers,\" and warmer it certainly was. In fact it was\r\nso busy being warmer that it had no time to attend to the order about\r\nshowers, so there weren't any.\r\n\r\nHave you ever been up at five o'clock on a fine summer morning? It is\r\nvery beautiful. The sunlight is pinky and yellowy, and all the grass and\r\ntrees are covered with dew-diamonds. And all the shadows go the opposite\r\nway to the way they do in the evening, which is very interesting and\r\nmakes you feel as though you were in a new other world.\r\n\r\nAnthea woke at five. She had made herself wake, and I must tell you how\r\nit is done, even if it keeps you waiting for the story to go on.\r\n\r\nYou get into bed at night, and lie down quite flat on your little back,\r\nwith your hands straight down by your sides. Then you say \"I _must_ wake\r\nup at five\" (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or whatever the time\r\nis that you want), and as you say it you push your chin down on your\r\nchest and then whack your head back on the pillow. And you do this as\r\nmany times as there are ones in the time you want to wake up at. (It is\r\nquite an easy sum.) Of course everything depends on your really wanting\r\nto get up at five (or six, or seven, or eight, or nine); if you don't\r\nreally want to, it's all of no use. But if you do--well, try it and see.\r\nOf course in this, as in doing Latin proses or getting into mischief,\r\npractice makes perfect.\r\n\r\nAnthea was quite perfect.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when she opened her eyes she heard the black-and-gold\r\nclock down in the dining-room strike eleven. So she knew it was three\r\nminutes to five. The black-and-gold clock always struck wrong, but it\r\nwas all right when you knew what it meant. It was like a person talking\r\na foreign language. If you know the language it is just as easy to\r\nunderstand as English. And Anthea knew the clock language. She was very\r\nsleepy, but she jumped out of bed and put her face and hands into a\r\nbasin of cold water. This is a fairy charm that prevents your wanting to\r\nget back into bed again. Then she dressed, and folded up her night\r\ndress. She did not tumble it together by the sleeves, but folded it by\r\nthe seams from the hem, and that will show you the kind of\r\nwell-brought-up little girl she was.\r\n\r\nThen she took her shoes in her hand and crept softly down the stairs.\r\nShe opened the dining-room window and climbed out. It would have been\r\njust as easy to go out by the door, but the window was more romantic,\r\nand less likely to be noticed by Martha.\r\n\r\n\"I will always get up at five,\" she said to herself. \"It was quite too\r\nawfully pretty for anything.\"\r\n\r\nHer heart was beating very fast, for she was carrying out a plan quite\r\nher own. She could not be sure that it was a good plan, but she was\r\nquite sure that it would not be any better if she were to tell the\r\nothers about it. And she had a feeling that, right or wrong, she would\r\nrather go through with it alone. She put on her shoes under the iron\r\nverandah, on the red-and-yellow shining tiles, and then she ran straight\r\nto the sand-pit, and found the Psammead's place, and dug it out; it was\r\nvery cross indeed.\r\n\r\n\"It's too bad,\" it said, fluffing up its fur as pigeons do their\r\nfeathers at Christmas time. \"The weather's arctic, and it's the middle\r\nof the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" said Anthea gently, and she took off her white pinafore\r\nand covered the Sand-fairy up with it, all but its head, its bat's ears,\r\nand its eyes that were like a snail's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" it said, \"that's better. What's the wish this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said; \"that's just it. You see we've been very\r\nunlucky, so far. I wanted to talk to you about it. But--would you mind\r\nnot giving me any wishes till after breakfast? It's so hard to talk to\r\nanyone if they jump out at you with wishes you don't really want!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't say you wish for things if you don't wish for them. In\r\nthe old days people almost always knew whether it was Megatherium or\r\nIchthyosaurus they really wanted for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try not to do so,\" said Anthea, \"but I do wish\"--\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" said the Psammead in a warning voice, and it began to blow\r\nitself out.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this isn't a magic wish--it's just--I should be so glad if you'd\r\nnot swell yourself out and nearly burst to give me anything just now.\r\nWait till the others are here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" it said indulgently, but it shivered.\r\n\r\n\"Would you,\" asked Anthea kindly--\"would you like to come and sit on my\r\nlap? You'd be warmer, and I could turn the skirt of my frock up around\r\nyou. I'd be very careful.\"\r\n\r\nAnthea had never expected that it would, but it did.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" it said; \"you really are rather thoughtful.\" It crept on to\r\nher lap and snuggled down, and she put her arms round it with a rather\r\nfrightened gentleness. \"Now then!\" it said.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Anthea, \"everything we have wished has turned out\r\nrather horrid. I wish you would advise us. You are so old, you must be\r\nvery wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was always generous from a child,\" said the Sand-fairy. \"I've spent\r\nthe whole of my waking hours in giving. But one thing I won't\r\ngive--that's advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" Anthea went on, \"it's such a wonderful thing--such a\r\nsplendid, glorious chance. It's so good and kind and dear of you to give\r\nus our wishes, and it seems such a pity it should all be wasted just\r\nbecause we are too silly to know what to wish for.\"\r\n\r\nAnthea had meant to say that--and she had not wanted to say it before\r\nthe others. It's one thing to say you're silly, and quite another to\r\nsay that other people are.\r\n\r\n\"Child,\" said the Sand-fairy sleepily, \"I can only advise you to think\r\nbefore you speak\"--\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you never gave advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That piece doesn't count,\" it said. \"You'll never take it! Besides,\r\nit's not original. It's in all the copy-books.\"\r\n\r\n\"But won't you just say if you think wings would be a silly wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wings?\" it said. \"I should think you might do worse. Only, take care\r\nyou aren't flying high at sunset. There was a little Ninevite boy I\r\nheard of once. He was one of King Sennacherib's sons, and a traveller\r\nbrought him a Psammead. He used to keep it in a box of sand on the\r\npalace terrace. It was a dreadful degradation for one of us, of course;\r\nstill the boy _was_ the Assyrian King's son. And one day he wished for\r\nwings and got them. But he forgot that they would turn into stone at\r\nsunset, and when they did he fell on to one of the winged lions at the\r\ntop of his father's great staircase; and what with _his_ stone wings\r\nand the lion's stone wings--well it's not a very pretty story! But I\r\nbelieve the boy enjoyed himself very much till then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Anthea, \"why don't our wishes turn into stone now? Why\r\ndo they just vanish?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Autre temps autres moeurs_,\" said the creature.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the Ninevite language?\" asked Anthea, who had learned no\r\nforeign language at school except French.\r\n\r\n\"What I mean is,\" the Psammead went on, \"that in the old days people\r\nwished for good solid everyday gifts,--Mammoths and Pterodactyls and\r\nthings,--and those could be turned into stone as easy as not. But people\r\nwish such high-flying fanciful things nowadays. How are you going to\r\nturn being beautiful as the day, or being wanted by everybody, into\r\nstone? You see it can't be done. And it would never do to have two\r\nrules, so they simply vanish. If being beautiful as the day _could_ be\r\nturned into stone it would last an awfully long time, you know--much\r\nlonger than you would. Just look at the Greek statues. It's just as\r\nwell as it is. Good-bye. I _am_ so sleepy.\"\r\n\r\nIt jumped off her lap--dug frantically, and vanished.\r\n\r\nAnthea was late for breakfast. It was Robert who quietly poured a\r\nspoonful of molasses down the Lamb's frock, so that he had to be taken\r\naway and washed thoroughly directly after breakfast. And it was of\r\ncourse a very naughty thing to do; yet it served two purposes--it\r\ndelighted the Lamb, who loved above all things to be completely sticky,\r\nand it engaged Martha's attention so that the others could slip away to\r\nthe sand-pit without the Lamb.\r\n\r\nThey did it, and in the lane Anthea, breathless from the hurry of that\r\nslipping, panted out--\r\n\r\n\"I want to propose we take turns to wish. Only, nobody's to have a wish\r\nif the others don't think it's a nice wish. Do you agree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's to have first wish?\" asked Robert cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Me, if you don't mind,\" said Anthea apologetically. \"And I've thought\r\nabout it--and it's _wings_.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. The others rather wanted to find fault, but it was\r\nhard, because the word \"wings\" raised a flutter of joyous excitement in\r\nevery breast.\r\n\r\n\"Not so dusty,\" said Cyril generously; and Robert added, \"Really,\r\nPanther, you're not quite such a fool as you look.\"\r\n\r\nJane said, \"I think it would be perfectly lovely. It's like a bright\r\ndream of delirium.\"\r\n\r\nThey found the Sand-fairy easily. Anthea said--\r\n\r\n\"I wish we all had beautiful wings to fly with.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sand-fairy blew himself out, and next moment each child felt a funny\r\nfeeling, half heaviness and half lightness, on its shoulders. The\r\nPsammead put its head on one side and turned its snail eyes from one\r\nside to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sand-fairy blew himself out]\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad,\" it said dreamily. \"But really, Robert, you're not quite\r\nsuch an angel as you look.\" Robert almost blushed.\r\n\r\nThe wings were very big, and more beautiful than you can possibly\r\nimagine--for they were soft and smooth, and every feather lay neatly in\r\nits place. And the feathers were of the most lovely mixed changing\r\ncolors, like the rainbow, or iridescent glass, or the beautiful scum\r\nthat sometimes floats on water that is not at all nice to drink.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--but how can we fly?\" Jane said, standing anxiously first on one\r\nfoot and then on the other.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" said Cyril; \"you're treading on my wing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt?\" asked Anthea with interest; but no one answered, for\r\nRobert had spread his wings and jumped up, and now he was slowly rising\r\nin the air. He looked very awkward in his knickerbocker suit--his boots\r\nin particular hung helplessly, and seemed much larger than when he was\r\nstanding in them. But the others cared but little how he looked,--or how\r\nthey looked, for that matter. For now they all spread out their wings\r\nand rose in the air. Of course you all know what flying feels like,\r\nbecause everyone has dreamed about flying, and is seems so beautifully\r\neasy--only, you can never remember how you did it; and as a rule you\r\nhave to do it without wings, in your dreams, which is more clever and\r\nuncommon, but not so easy to remember the rule for. Now the four\r\nchildren rose flapping from the ground, and you can't think how good the\r\nair felt as it ran against their faces. Their wings were tremendously\r\nwide when they were spread out, and they had to fly quite a long way\r\napart so as not to get in each other's way. But little things like this\r\nare easily learned.\r\n\r\nAll the words in the English Dictionary, and in the Greek Lexicon as\r\nwell, are, I find, of no use at all to tell you exactly what it feels\r\nlike to be flying, so I will not try. But I will say that to look _down_\r\non the fields and woods instead of _along_ at them, is something like\r\nlooking at a beautiful live map, where, instead of silly colors on\r\npaper, you have real moving sunny woods and green fields laid out one\r\nafter the other. As Cyril said, and I can't think where he got hold of\r\nsuch a strange expression, \"It does you a fair treat!\" It was most\r\nwonderful and more like real magic than any wish the children had had\r\nyet. They flapped and flew and sailed on their great rainbow wings,\r\nbetween green earth and blue sky; and they flew over Rochester and then\r\nswerved round towards Maidstone, and presently they all began to feel\r\nextremely hungry. Curiously enough, this happened when they were flying\r\nrather low, and just as they were crossing an orchard where some early\r\nplums shone red and ripe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They flew over Rochester]\r\n\r\nThey paused on their wings. I cannot explain to you how this is done,\r\nbut it is something like treading water when you are swimming, and hawks\r\ndo it extremely well.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I daresay,\" said Cyril, though no one had spoken. \"But stealing is\r\nstealing even if you've got wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think so?\" said Jane briskly. \"If you've got wings you're\r\na bird, and no one minds birds breaking the commandments. At least,\r\nthey may _mind_, but the birds always do it, and no one scolds them or\r\nsends them to prison.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not so easy to perch on a plum-tree as you might think, because\r\nthe rainbow wings were so _very_ large; but somehow they all managed to\r\ndo it, and the plums were certainly very sweet and juicy.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it was not till they had all had quite as many plums as\r\nwere good for them that they saw a stout man, who looked exactly as\r\nthough he owned the plum-trees, come hurrying through the orchard gate\r\nwith a thick stick, and with one accord they disentangled their wings\r\nfrom the plum-laden branches and began to fly.\r\n\r\nThe man stopped short, with his mouth open. For he had seen the boughs\r\nof his trees moving and twitching, and he had said to himself, \"Them\r\nyoung varmint--at it again!\" And he had come out at once, for the lads\r\nof the village had taught him in past seasons that plums want looking\r\nafter. But when he saw the rainbow wings flutter up out of the\r\nplum-tree he felt that he must have gone quite mad, and he did not like\r\nthe feeling at all. And when Anthea looked down and saw his mouth go\r\nslowly open, and stay so, and his face become green and mauve in\r\npatches, she called out--\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened,\" and felt hastily in her pocket for a\r\nthreepenny-bit with a hole in it, which she had meant to hang on a\r\nribbon round her neck, for luck. She hovered round the unfortunate\r\nplum-owner, and said, \"We have had some of your plums; we thought it\r\nwasn't stealing, but now I am not so sure. So here's some money to pay\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\nShe swooped down toward the terror-stricken grower of plums, and slipped\r\nthe coin into the pocket of his jacket, and in a few flaps she had\r\nrejoined the others.\r\n\r\nThe farmer sat down on the grass, suddenly and heavily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The farmer sat down on the grass suddenly and heavily]\r\n\r\n\"Well--I'm blessed!\" he said. \"This here is what they call delusions, I\r\nsuppose. But this here threepenny\"--he had pulled it out and bitten\r\nit,--\"_that's_ real enough. Well, from this day forth I'll be a better\r\nman. It's the kind of thing to sober a chap for life, this is. I'm glad\r\nit was only wings, though. I'd rather see the birds as aren't there, and\r\ncouldn't be, even if they pretend to talk, than some things as I could\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up slowly and heavily, and went indoors, and he was so nice to\r\nhis wife that day that she felt quite happy, and said to herself, \"Law,\r\nwhatever have a-come to the man!\" and smartened herself up and put a\r\nblue ribbon bow at the place where her collar fastened on, and looked so\r\npretty that he was kinder than ever. So perhaps the winged children\r\nreally did do one good thing that day. If so, it was the only one; for\r\nreally there is nothing like wings for getting you into trouble. But, on\r\nthe other hand, if you are in trouble, there is nothing like wings for\r\ngetting you out of it.\r\n\r\nThis was the case in the matter of the fierce dog who sprang out at them\r\nwhen they had folded up their wings as small as possible and were going\r\nup to a farm door to ask for a crust of bread and cheese, for in\r\nspite of the plums they were soon just as hungry as ever again.\r\n\r\nNow there is no doubt whatever that, if the four had been ordinary\r\nwingless children, that black and fierce dog would have had a good bite\r\nout of the brown-stockinged leg of Robert, who was the nearest. But at\r\nits first growl there was a flutter of wings, and the dog was left to\r\nstrain at his chain and stand on his hind-legs as if he were trying to\r\nfly too.\r\n\r\nThey tried several other farms, but at those where there were no dogs\r\nthe people were far too frightened to do anything but scream; and at\r\nlast, when it was nearly four o'clock, and their wings were getting\r\nmiserably stiff and tired, they alighted on a church-tower and held a\r\ncouncil of war.\r\n\r\n\"We can't possibly fly all the way home without dinner _or_ tea,\" said\r\nRobert with desperate decision.\r\n\r\n\"And nobody will give us any dinner, or even lunch, let alone tea,\" said\r\nCyril.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the clergyman here might,\" suggested Anthea. \"He must know all\r\nabout angels\"--\r\n\r\n\"Anybody could see we're not that,\" said Jane. \"Look at Robert's boots\r\nand Squirrel's plaid necktie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cyril firmly, \"if the country you're in won't _sell_\r\nprovisions, you _take_ them. In wars I mean. I'm quite certain you do.\r\nAnd even in other stories no good brother would allow his little sisters\r\nto starve in the midst of plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty?\" repeated Robert hungrily; and the others looked vaguely round\r\nthe bare leads of the church-tower, and murmured, \"In the midst of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cyril impressively. \"There is a larder window at the side of\r\nthe clergyman's house, and I saw things to eat inside--custard pudding\r\nand cold chicken and tongue--and pies--and jam. It's rather a high\r\nwindow--but with wings\"--\r\n\r\n\"How clever of you!\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Cyril modestly; \"any born general--Napoleon or the\r\nDuke of Marlborough--would have seen it just the same as I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems very wrong,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Cyril. \"What was it Sir Philip Sidney said when the\r\nsoldier wouldn't give him a drink?--'My necessity is greater than his.'\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll club together our money, though, and leave it to pay for the\r\nthings, won't we?\" Anthea was persuasive, and very nearly in tears,\r\nbecause it is most trying to feel enormously hungry and unspeakably\r\nsinful at one and the same time.\r\n\r\n\"Some of it,\" was the cautious reply.\r\n\r\nEveryone now turned out its pockets on the lead roof of the tower, where\r\nvisitors for the last hundred and fifty years had cut their own and\r\ntheir sweethearts' initials with penknives in the soft lead. There was\r\nfive-and-seven-pence halfpenny altogether, and even the upright Anthea\r\nadmitted that that was too much to pay for four people's dinners. Robert\r\nsaid he thought eighteenpence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Every one now turned out his pockets]\r\n\r\nAnd half-a-crown was finally agreed to be \"handsome.\"\r\n\r\nSo Anthea wrote on the back of her last term's report, which happened to\r\nbe in her pocket, and from which she first tore her own name and that of\r\nthe school, the following letter:--\r\n\r\n          \"DEAR REVEREND CLERGYMAN,--We are very hungry\r\n          indeed because of having to fly all day, and we\r\n          think it is not stealing when you are starving to\r\n          death. We are afraid to ask you for fear you\r\n          should say 'No,' because of course you know about\r\n          angels, but you would not think we were angels. We\r\n          will only take the necessities of life, and no\r\n          pudding or pie, to show you it is not grediness\r\n          but true starvation that makes us make your larder\r\n          stand and deliver. But we are not highwaymen by\r\n          trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut it short,\" said the others with one accord. And Anthea hastily\r\nadded--\r\n\r\n          \"Our intentions are quite honourable if you only\r\n          knew. And here is half-a-crown to show we are\r\n          sinseer and grateful.\r\n\r\n          \"Thank you for your kind hospitality.\r\n\r\n                                          \"FROM US FOUR.\"\r\n\r\nThe half-crown was wrapped in this letter, and all the children felt\r\nthat when the clergyman had read it he would understand everything, as\r\nwell as anyone could who had not even seen the wings.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Cyril, \"of course there's some risk; we'd better fly\r\nstraight down the other side of the tower and then flutter low across\r\nthe churchyard and in through the shrubbery. There doesn't seem to be\r\nanyone about. But you never know. The window looks out into the\r\nshrubbery. It is embowered in foliage, like a window in a story. I'll go\r\nin and get the things. Robert and Anthea can take them as I hand them\r\nout through the window; and Jane can keep watch,--her eyes are\r\nsharp,--and whistle if she sees anyone about. Shut up, Robert! she can\r\nwhistle quite well enough for that, anyway. It ought not to be a very\r\ngood whistle--it'll sound more natural and birdlike. Now then--off we\r\ngo!\"\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend that stealing is right. I can only say that on this\r\noccasion it did not look like stealing to the hungry four, but appeared\r\nin the light of a fair and reasonable business transaction. They had\r\nnever happened to learn that a tongue,--hardly cut into,--a chicken and\r\na half, a loaf of bread, and a syphon of soda-water cannot be bought in\r\nthe stores for half-a-crown. These were the necessaries of life, which\r\nCyril handed out of the larder window when, quite unobserved and without\r\nhindrance or adventure, he had led the others to that happy spot. He\r\nfelt that to refrain from jam, apple pie, cake, and mixed candied peel,\r\nwas a really heroic act--and I agree with him. He was also proud of not\r\ntaking the custard pudding,--and there I think he was wrong,--because if\r\nhe had taken it there would have been a difficulty about returning the\r\ndish; no one, however starving, has a right to steal china pie-dishes\r\nwith little pink flowers on them. The soda-water syphon was different.\r\nThey could not do without something to drink, and as the maker's name\r\nwas on it they felt sure it would be returned to him wherever they might\r\nleave it. If they had time they would take it back themselves. The\r\nman appeared to live in Rochester, which would not be much out of their\r\nway home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: These were the necessaries of life]\r\n\r\nEverything was carried up to the top of the tower, and laid down on a\r\nsheet of kitchen paper which Cyril had found on the top shelf of the\r\nlarder. As he unfolded it, Anthea said, \"I don't think _that's_ a\r\nnecessity of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" said he. \"We must put the things down somewhere to cut\r\nthem up; and I heard father say the other day people got diseases from\r\ngermans in rain-water. Now there must be lots of rain-water here,--and\r\nwhen it dries up the germans are left, and they'd get into the things,\r\nand we should all die of scarlet fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are germans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little waggly things you see with microscopes,\" said Cyril, with a\r\nscientific air. \"They give you every illness you can think of. I'm sure\r\nthe paper was a necessary, just as much as the bread and meat and water.\r\nNow then! Oh, I'm hungry!\"\r\n\r\nI do not wish to describe the picnic party on the top of the tower. You\r\ncan imagine well enough what it is like to carve a chicken and a tongue\r\nwith a knife that has only one blade and that snapped off short about\r\nhalf-way down. But it was done. Eating with your fingers is greasy and\r\ndifficult--and paper dishes soon get to look very spotty and horrid. But\r\none thing you _can't_ imagine, and that is how soda-water behaves when\r\nyou try to drink it straight out of a syphon--especially a quite full\r\none. But if imagination will not help you, experience will, and you can\r\neasily try it for yourself if you can get a grown-up to give you the\r\nsyphon. If you want to have a really thorough experience, put the tube\r\nin your mouth and press the handle very suddenly and very hard. You had\r\nbetter do it when you are alone--and out of doors is best for this\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nHowever you eat them, tongue and chicken and new bread are very good\r\nthings, and no one minds being sprinkled a little with soda-water on a\r\nreally fine hot day. So that everyone enjoyed the dinner very much\r\nindeed, and everyone ate as much as it possibly could: first, because it\r\nwas extremely hungry; and secondly, because, as I said, tongue and\r\nchicken and new bread are very nice.\r\n\r\nNow, I daresay you will have noticed that if you have to wait for your\r\ndinner till long after the proper time, and then eat a great deal more\r\ndinner than usual, and sit in the hot sun on the top of a\r\nchurch-tower--or even anywhere else--you become soon and strangely\r\nsleepy. Now Anthea and Jane and Cyril and Robert were very like you in\r\nmany ways, and when they had eaten all they could, and drunk all there\r\nwas, they became sleepy, strangely and soon--especially Anthea, because\r\nshe had gotten up so early.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The children were fast asleep]\r\n\r\nOne by one they left off talking and leaned back, and before it was a\r\nquarter of an hour after dinner they had all curled round and tucked\r\nthemselves up under their large soft warm wings and were fast asleep.\r\nAnd the sun was sinking slowly in the west. (I must say it was in the\r\nwest, because it is usual in books to say so, for fear careless people\r\nshould think it was setting in the east. In point of fact, it was not\r\nexactly in the west either--but that's near enough.) The sun, I repeat,\r\nwas sinking slowly in the west, and the children slept warmly and\r\nhappily on--for wings are cosier than eider-down quilts to sleep under.\r\nThe shadow of the church-tower fell across the churchyard, and across\r\nthe Vicarage, and across the field beyond; and presently there were no\r\nmore shadows, and the sun had set, and the wings were gone. And still\r\nthe children slept. But not for long. Twilight is very beautiful, but it\r\nis chilly; and you know, however sleepy you are, you wake up soon enough\r\nif your brother or sister happens to be up first and pulls your blankets\r\noff you. The four wingless children shivered and woke. And there they\r\nwere,--on the top of a church-tower in the dusky twilight, with blue\r\nstars coming out by ones and twos and tens and twenties over their\r\nheads,--miles away from home, with three shillings and three-halfpence\r\nin their pockets, and a doubtful act about the necessities of life to\r\nbe accounted for if anyone found them with the soda-water syphon.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other. Cyril spoke first, picking up the syphon--\r\n\r\n\"We'd better get along down and get rid of this beastly thing. It's dark\r\nenough to leave it on the clergyman's doorstep, I should think. Come\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a little turret at the corner of the tower, and the little\r\nturret had a door in it. They had noticed this when they were eating,\r\nbut had not explored it, as you would have done in their place. Because,\r\nof course, when you have wings and can explore the whole sky, doors seem\r\nhardly worth exploring.\r\n\r\nNow they turned towards it.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Cyril \"this is the way down.\"\r\n\r\nIt was. But the door was locked on the inside!\r\n\r\nAnd the world was growing darker and darker. And they were miles from\r\nhome. And there was the soda-water syphon.\r\n\r\nI shall not tell you whether anyone cried, nor, if so, how many cried,\r\nnor who cried. You will be better employed in making up your minds what\r\nyou would have done if you had been in their place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nNO WINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether anyone cried or not, there was certainly an interval during\r\nwhich none of the party was quite itself. When they grew calmer, Anthea\r\nput her handkerchief in her pocket and her arm round Jane, and said--\r\n\r\n\"It can't be for more than one night. We can signal with our\r\nhandkerchiefs in the morning. They'll be dry then. And someone will come\r\nup and let us out\"--\r\n\r\n\"And find the syphon,\" said Cyril gloomily; \"and we shall be sent to\r\nprison for stealing\"--\r\n\r\n\"You said it wasn't stealing. You said you were sure it wasn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure _now_\" said Cyril shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Let's throw the thing away among the trees,\" said Robert, \"then no one\r\ncan do anything to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\"--Cyril's laugh was not a light-hearted one,--\"and hit some\r\nchap on the head, and be murderers as well as--as the other thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't stay up here all night,\" said Jane; \"and I want my tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _can't_ want your tea,\" said Robert; \"you've only just had your\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I _do_ want it,\" she said; \"especially when you begin talking about\r\nstopping up here all night. Oh, Panther--I want to go home! I want to go\r\nhome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush,\" Anthea said. \"Don't, dear. It'll be all right, somehow.\r\nDon't, don't\"--\r\n\r\n\"Let her cry,\" said Robert desperately; \"if she howls loud enough,\r\nsomeone may hear and come and let us out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And see the soda-water thing,\" said Anthea swiftly. \"Robert, don't be a\r\nbrute. Oh, Jane, do try to be a man! It's just the same for all of us.\"\r\n\r\nJane did try to \"be a man\"--and reduced her howls to sniffs.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then Cyril said slowly, \"Look here. We must risk that\r\nsyphon. I'll button it up inside my jacket--perhaps no one will notice\r\nit. You others keep well in front of me. There are lights in the\r\nclergyman's house. They've not gone to bed yet. We must just yell as\r\nloud as ever we can. Now all scream when I say three. Robert, you do the\r\nyell like a railway engine, and I'll do the coo-ee like father's. The\r\ngirls can do as they please. One, two, three!\"\r\n\r\nA four-fold yell rent the silent peace of the evening, and a maid at one\r\nof the Vicarage windows paused with her hand on the blind-cord.\r\n\r\n\"One, two, three!\" Another yell, piercing and complex, startled the owls\r\nand starlings to a flutter of feathers in the belfry below. The maid\r\nflew from the Vicarage window and ran down the Vicarage stairs and into\r\nthe Vicarage kitchen, and fainted as soon as she had explained to the\r\nman-servant and the cook and the cook's cousin that she had seen a\r\nghost. It was quite untrue, of course, but I suppose the girl's nerves\r\nwere a little upset by the yelling.\r\n\r\n\"One, two, three!\" The Vicar was on his doorstep by this time, and there\r\nwas no mistaking the yell that greeted him.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness me,\" he said to his wife, \"my dear, someone's being murdered\r\nin the church! Give me my hat and a thick stick, and tell Andrew to come\r\nafter me. I expect it's the lunatic who stole the tongue.\"\r\n\r\nThe children had seen the flash of light when the Vicar opened his front\r\ndoor. They had seen his dark form on his doorstep, and they had paused\r\nfor breath, and also to see what he would do.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned back for his hat, Cyril said hastily--\r\n\r\n\"He thinks he only fancied he heard something. You don't half yell! Now!\r\nOne, two, three!\"\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a whole yell this time, and the Vicar's wife flung her\r\narms round her husband and screamed a feeble echo of it.\r\n\r\n\"You shan't go!\" she said, \"not alone. Jessie!\"--the maid unfainted and\r\ncame out of the kitchen,--\"send Andrew at once. There's a dangerous\r\nlunatic in the church, and he must go immediately and catch him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect he _will_ catch it too,\" said Jessie to herself as she went\r\nthrough the kitchen door. \"Here, Andrew,\" she said, \"there's someone\r\nscreaming like mad in the church, and the missus says you're to go along\r\nand catch it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not alone, I don't,\" said Andrew in low firm tones. To his master he\r\nmerely said, \"Yis sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard those screams?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did think I noticed a sort of something,\" said Andrew.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come on, then,\" said the Vicar. \"My dear, I _must_ go!\" He pushed\r\nher gently into the sitting-room, banged the door, and rushed out,\r\ndragging Andrew by the arm.\r\n\r\nA volley of yells greeted them. Then as it died into silence Andrew\r\nshouted, \"Hullo, you there! Did you call?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" shouted four far-away voices.\r\n\r\n\"They seem to be in the air,\" said the Vicar. \"Very remarkable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?\" shouted Andrew; and Cyril replied in his deepest\r\nvoice, very slow and loud--\r\n\r\n\"CHURCH! TOWER! TOP!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come down, then!\" said Andrew; and the same voice replied--\r\n\r\n\"_Can't! Door locked!_\"\r\n\r\n\"My goodness!\" said the Vicar. \"Andrew, fetch the stable lantern.\r\nPerhaps it would be as well to fetch another man from the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the rest of the gang about, very likely. No, sir; if this 'ere\r\nain't a trap--well, may I never! There's cook's cousin at the back door\r\nnow. He's a keeper, sir, and used to dealing with vicious characters.\r\nAnd he's got his gun, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hullo there!\" shouted Cyril from the church-tower; \"come up and let us\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're a-coming,\" said Andrew. \"I'm a-going to get a policeman and a\r\ngun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Andrew, Andrew,\" said the Vicar, \"that's not the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's near enough, sir, for the likes of them.\"\r\n\r\nSo Andrew fetched the lantern and the cook's cousin; and the Vicar's\r\nwife begged them all to be very careful.\r\n\r\nThey went across the churchyard--it was quite dark now--and as they went\r\nthey talked. The Vicar was certain a lunatic was on the\r\nchurch-tower--the one who had written the mad letter, and taken the cold\r\ntongue and things. Andrew thought it was a \"trap\"; the cook's cousin\r\nalone was calm. \"Great cry, little wool,\" said he; \"dangerous chaps is\r\nquieter.\" He was not at all afraid. But then he had a gun. That was why\r\nhe was asked to lead the way up the worn, steep, dark steps of the\r\nchurch-tower. He did lead the way, with the lantern in one hand and the\r\ngun in the other. Andrew went next. He pretended afterwards that this\r\nwas because he was braver than his master, but really it was because he\r\nthought of traps and he did not like the idea of being behind the others\r\nfor fear someone should come softly up behind him and catch hold of his\r\nlegs in the dark. They went on and on, and round and round the little\r\ncorkscrew staircase--then through the bell-ringers' loft, where the\r\nbell-ropes hung with soft furry ends like giant caterpillars--then up\r\nanother stair into the belfry, where the big quiet bells are--and then\r\non up a ladder with broad steps--and then up a little stone stair. And\r\nat the top of that there was a little door. And the door was bolted on\r\nthe stair side.\r\n\r\nThe cook's cousin, who was a gamekeeper, kicked at the door, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, you there!\"\r\n\r\nThe children were holding on to each other on the other side of the\r\ndoor, and trembling with anxiousness--and very hoarse with their howls.\r\nThey could hardly speak, but Cyril managed to reply huskily--\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, you there!\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get up there?\"\r\n\r\nIt was no use saying \"We flew up,\" so Cyril said--\r\n\r\n\"We got up--and then we found the door was locked and we couldn't get\r\ndown. Let us out--do.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many of you are there?\" asked the keeper.\r\n\r\n\"Only four,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"Are you armed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got my gun handy--so you'd best not try any tricks,\" said the\r\nkeeper. \"If we open the door, will you promise to come quietly down, and\r\nno nonsense?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--oh YES!\" said all the children together.\r\n\r\n\"Bless me,\" said the Vicar, \"surely that was a female voice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I open the door, sir?\" said the keeper. Andrew went down a few\r\nsteps, \"to leave room for the others\" he said afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Vicar, \"open the door. Remember,\" he said through the\r\nkeyhole, \"we have come to release you. You will keep your promise to\r\nrefrain from violence?\"\r\n\r\n\"How this bolt do stick,\" said the keeper; \"anyone 'ud think it hadn't\r\nbeen drawed for half a year.\" As a matter of fact it hadn't.\r\n\r\nWhen all the bolts were drawn, the keeper spoke deep-chested words\r\nthrough the keyhole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The keeper spoke deep-chested words through the keyhole]\r\n\r\n\"I don't open,\" said he, \"till you've gone over to the other side of the\r\ntower. And if one of you comes at me I fire. Now!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're all over on the other side,\" said the voices.\r\n\r\nThe keeper felt pleased with himself, and owned himself a bold man when\r\nhe threw open that door, and, stepping out into the leads, flashed the\r\nfull light of the stable lantern on the group of desperadoes standing\r\nagainst the parapet on the other side of the tower.\r\n\r\nHe lowered his gun, and he nearly dropped the lantern.\r\n\r\n\"So help me,\" he cried, \"if they ain't a pack of kiddies!\"\r\n\r\nThe Vicar now advanced.\r\n\r\n\"How did you come here?\" he asked severely. \"Tell me at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, take us down,\" said Jane, catching at his coat, \"and we'll tell you\r\nanything you like. You won't believe us, but it doesn't matter. Oh, take\r\nus down!\"\r\n\r\nThe others crowded round him, with the same entreaty. All but Cyril.\r\nHe had enough to do with the soda-water syphon, which would keep\r\nslipping down under his jacket. It needed both hands to keep it steady\r\nin its place.\r\n\r\nBut he said, standing as far out of the lantern light as possible--\r\n\r\n\"Please do take us down.\"\r\n\r\nSo they were taken down. It is no joke to go down a strange church-tower\r\nin the dark, but the keeper helped them--only, Cyril had to be\r\nindependent because of the soda-water syphon. It would keep trying to\r\nget away. Half-way down the ladder it all but escaped. Cyril just caught\r\nit by its spout, and as nearly as possible lost his footing. He was\r\ntrembling and pale when at last they reached the bottom of the winding\r\nstair and stepped out on to the stones of the church-porch.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the keeper caught Cyril and Robert each by an arm.\r\n\r\n\"You bring along the gells, sir,\" said he; \"you and Andrew can manage\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let go!\" said Cyril; \"we aren't running away. We haven't hurt your old\r\nchurch. Leave go!\"\r\n\r\n\"You just come along,\" said the keeper; and Cyril dared not oppose him\r\nwith violence, because just then the syphon began to slip again.\r\n\r\nSo they were marched into the Vicarage study, and the Vicar's wife came\r\nrushing in.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, William, _are_ you safe?\" she cried.\r\n\r\nRobert hastened to allay her anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"he's quite safe. We haven't hurt them at all. And\r\nplease, we're very late, and they'll be anxious at home. Could you send\r\nus home in your carriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or perhaps there's a hotel near where we could get a carriage,\" said\r\nAnthea. \"Martha will be very anxious as it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vicar had sunk into a chair, overcome by emotion and amazement.\r\n\r\nCyril had also sat down, and was leaning forward with his elbows on his\r\nknees because of the soda-water syphon.\r\n\r\n\"But how did you come to be locked up in the church-tower?\" asked the\r\nVicar.\r\n\r\n\"We went up,\" said Robert slowly, \"and we were tired, and we all went to\r\nsleep, and when we woke up we found the door was locked, so we yelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you did!\" said the Vicar's wife. \"Frightening everybody\r\nout of their wits like this! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"We _are_,\" said Jane gently.\r\n\r\n\"But who locked the door?\" asked the Vicar.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know at all,\" said Robert, with perfect truth. \"Do please send\r\nus home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really,\" said the Vicar, \"I suppose we'd better. Andrew, put the\r\nhorse to, and you can take them home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not alone, I don't,\" said Andrew to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd the Vicar went on, \"let this be a lesson to you\"---- He went on\r\ntalking, and the children listened miserably. But the keeper was not\r\nlistening. He was looking at the unfortunate Cyril. He knew all about\r\npoachers, of course, so he knew how people look when they're hiding\r\nsomething. The Vicar had just got to the part about trying to grow up\r\nto be a blessing to your parents, and not a trouble and disgrace, when\r\nthe keeper suddenly said--\r\n\r\n\"Arst him what he's got there under his jacket;\" and Cyril knew that\r\nconcealment was at an end. So he stood up, and squared his shoulders and\r\ntried to look noble, like the boys in books that no one can look in the\r\nface of and doubt that they come of brave and noble families, and will\r\nbe faithful to the death, and he pulled out the syphon and said--\r\n\r\n\"Well, there you are, then.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Cyril went on--there was nothing else for it--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we took this out of your larder, and some chicken and tongue and\r\nbread. We were very hungry, and we didn't take the custard or jam. We\r\nonly took bread and meat and water,--and we couldn't help its being soda\r\nkind,--just the necessaries of life; and we left half-a-crown to pay for\r\nit, and we left a letter. And we're very sorry. And my father will pay a\r\nfine and anything you like, but don't send us to prison. Mother would\r\nbe so vexed. You know what you said about not being a disgrace. Well,\r\ndon't you go and do it to us--that's all! We're as sorry as we can be.\r\nThere!\"\r\n\r\n\"However did you get up to the larder window?\" said Mrs. Vicar.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you that,\" said Cyril firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the whole truth you've been telling me?\" asked the clergyman.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Jane suddenly; \"it's all true, but it's not the whole\r\ntruth. We can't tell you that. It's no good asking. Oh, do forgive us\r\nand take us home!\" She ran to the Vicar's wife and threw her arms round\r\nher. The Vicar's wife put her arms round Jane, and the keeper whispered\r\nbehind his hand to the Vicar--\r\n\r\n\"They're all right, sir--I expect it's a pal they're standing by.\r\nSomeone put 'em up to it, and they won't peach. Game little kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said the Vicar kindly, \"are you screening someone else? Had\r\nanyone else anything to do with this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Anthea, thinking of the Psammead; \"but it wasn't their\r\nfault.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my dears,\" said the Vicar, \"then let's say no more about it.\r\nOnly just tell us why you wrote such an odd letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Cyril. \"You see, Anthea wrote it in such a hurry,\r\nand it really didn't seem like stealing then. But afterwards, when we\r\nfound we couldn't get down off the church-tower, it seemed just exactly\r\nlike it. We are all very sorry\"--\r\n\r\n\"Say no more about it,\" said the Vicar's wife; \"but another time just\r\nthink before you take other people's tongues. Now--some cake and milk\r\nbefore you go home?\"\r\n\r\nWhen Andrew came to say that the horse was put to, and was he expected\r\nto be led alone into the trap that he had plainly seen from the first,\r\nhe found the children eating cake and drinking milk and laughing at the\r\nVicar's jokes. Jane was sitting on the Vicar's wife's lap.\r\n\r\nSo you see they got off better than they deserved.\r\n\r\nThe gamekeeper, who was the cook's cousin, asked leave to drive home\r\nwith them, and Andrew was only too glad to have someone to protect him\r\nfrom that trap he was so certain of.\r\n\r\nWhen the wagonette reached their own house, between the chalk-quarry and\r\nthe gravel-pit, the children were very sleepy, but they felt that they\r\nand the keeper were friends for life.\r\n\r\nAndrew dumped the children down at the iron gate without a word.\r\n\r\n\"You get along home,\" said the Vicarage cook's cousin, who was a\r\ngamekeeper. \"I'll get me home on shanks' mare.\"\r\n\r\nSo Andrew had to drive off alone, which he did not like at all, and it\r\nwas the keeper that was cousin to the Vicarage cook who went with the\r\nchildren to the door, and, when they had been swept to bed in a\r\nwhirlwind of reproaches, remained to explain to Martha and the cook and\r\nthe housemaid exactly what had happened. He explained so well that\r\nMartha was quite amicable the next morning.\r\n\r\nAfter that he often used to come over and see Martha, and in the\r\nend--but that is another story, as dear Mr. Kipling says.\r\n\r\nMartha was obliged to stick to what she had said the night before about\r\nkeeping the children indoors the next day for a punishment. But she\r\nwasn't at all ugly about it, and agreed to let Robert go out for half an\r\nhour to get something he particularly wanted.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was the day's wish.\r\n\r\nRobert rushed to the gravel-pit, found the Psammead, and presently\r\nwished for--\r\n\r\nBut that, too, is another story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA CASTLE AND NO DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe others were to be kept in as a punishment for the misfortunes of the\r\nday before. Of course Martha thought it was naughtiness, and not\r\nmisfortune--so you must not blame her. She only thought she was doing\r\nher duty. You know, grown-up people often say they do not like to punish\r\nyou, and that they only do it for your own good, and that it hurts them\r\nas much as it hurts you--and this is really very often the truth.\r\n\r\nMartha certainly hated having to punish the children quite as much as\r\nthey hated to be punished. For one thing, she knew what a noise there\r\nwould be in the house all day. And she had other reasons.\r\n\r\n\"I declare,\" she said to the cook, \"it seems almost a shame keeping of\r\nthem indoors this lovely day; but they are that audacious, they'll be\r\nwalking in with their heads knocked off some of these days, if I don't\r\nput my foot down. You make them a cake for tea to-morrow, dear. And\r\nwe'll have Baby along of us soon as we've got a bit forrard with our\r\nwork. Then they can have a good romp with him, out of the way. Now,\r\nEliza, come, get on with them beds. Here's ten o'clock nearly, and no\r\nrabbits caught!\"\r\n\r\nPeople say that in Kent when they mean \"and no work done.\"\r\n\r\nSo all the others were kept in, but Robert, as I have said, was allowed\r\nto go out for half an hour to get something they all wanted. And that,\r\nof course, was the day's wish.\r\n\r\nHe had no difficulty in finding the Sand-fairy, for the day was already\r\nso hot that it had actually, for the first time, come out of its own\r\naccord, and was sitting in a sort of pool of soft sand, stretching\r\nitself, and trimming its whiskers, and turning its snail's eyes round\r\nand round.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" it said when its left eye saw Robert; \"I've been looking for you.\r\nWhere are the rest of you? Not smashed themselves up with those wings,\r\nI hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Robert; \"but the wings got us into a row, just like all the\r\nwishes always do. So the others are kept indoors, and I was only let out\r\nfor half an hour--to get the wish. So please let me wish as quickly as I\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish away,\" said the Psammead, twisting itself round in the sand. But\r\nRobert couldn't wish away. He forgot all the things he had been thinking\r\nabout, and nothing would come into his head but little things for\r\nhimself, like candy, a foreign stamp album, or a knife with three blades\r\nand a corkscrew. He sat down to think better of things the others would\r\nnot have cared for--such as a football, or a pair of leg-guards, or to\r\nbe able to lick Simpkins Minor thoroughly when he went back to school.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Psammead at last, \"you'd better hurry up with that wish\r\nof yours. Time flies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it does,\" said Robert. \"_I_ can't think what to wish for. I wish\r\nyou could give one of the others their wish without their having to\r\ncome here to ask for it. Oh, _don't_!\"\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. The Psammead had blown itself out to about three\r\ntimes its proper size, and now it collapsed like a pricked bubble, and\r\nwith a deep sigh leaned back against the edge of the sand-pool, quite\r\nfaint with the effort.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" it said in a weak voice; \"it was tremendously hard--but I did\r\nit. Run along home, or they're sure to wish for something silly before\r\nyou get there.\"\r\n\r\nThey were--quite sure; Robert felt this, and as he ran home his mind was\r\ndeeply occupied with the sort of wishes he might find they had wished in\r\nhis absence. They might wish for rabbits, or white mice, or chocolate,\r\nor a fine day to-morrow, or even--and that was most likely--someone\r\nmight have said, \"I do wish to goodness Robert would hurry up.\" Well, he\r\n_was_ hurrying up, and so they would have had their wish, and the day\r\nwould be wasted. Then he tried to think what they could wish\r\nfor--something that would be amusing indoors. That had been his own\r\ndifficulty from the beginning. So few things are amusing indoors when\r\nthe sun is shining outside and you mayn't go out, however much you want\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nRobert was running as fast as he could, but when he turned the corner\r\nthat ought to have brought him within sight of the architect's\r\nnightmare--the ornamental iron-work on the top of the house--he opened\r\nhis eyes so wide that he had to drop into a walk; for you cannot run\r\nwith your eyes wide open. Then suddenly he stopped short, for there was\r\nno house to be seen. The front garden railings were gone too, and where\r\nthe house had stood--Robert rubbed his eyes and looked again. Yes, the\r\nothers _had_ wished,--there was no doubt about it,--and they must have\r\nwished that they lived in a castle; for there the castle stood, black\r\nand stately, and very tall and broad, with battlements and lancet\r\nwindows, and eight great towers; and, where the garden and the orchard\r\nhad been, there were white things dotted like mushrooms. Robert walked\r\nslowly on, and as he got nearer he saw that these were tents, and men in\r\narmor were walking about among the tents--crowds and crowds of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There the castle stood, black and stately]\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Robert fervently. \"They _have_! They've wished for a castle,\r\nand it's being besieged! It's just like that Sand-fairy! I wish we'd\r\nnever seen the beastly thing!\"\r\n\r\nAt the little window above the great gateway, across the moat that now\r\nlay where the garden had been but half an hour ago, someone was waving\r\nsomething pale dust-colored. Robert thought it was one of Cyril's\r\nhandkerchiefs. They had never been white since the day when he had upset\r\nthe bottle of \"Combined Toning and Fixing Solution\" into the drawer\r\nwhere they were. Robert waved back, and immediately felt that he had\r\nbeen unwise. For this signal had been seen by the besieging force, and\r\ntwo men in steel-caps were coming towards him. They had high brown boots\r\non their long legs, and they came towards him with such great strides\r\nthat Robert remembered the shortness of his own legs and did not run\r\naway. He knew it would be useless to himself, and he feared it might be\r\nirritating to the foe. So he stood still--and the two men seemed quite\r\npleased with him.\r\n\r\n\"By my halidom,\" said one, \"a brave varlet this!\"\r\n\r\nRobert felt pleased at being _called_ brave, and somehow it made him\r\n_feel_ brave. He passed over the \"varlet.\" It was the way people talked\r\nin historical romances for the young, he knew, and it was evidently not\r\nmeant for rudeness. He only hoped he would be able to understand what\r\nthey said to him. He had not been always able quite to follow the\r\nconversations in the historical romances for the young.\r\n\r\n\"His garb is strange,\" said the other. \"Some outlandish treachery,\r\nbelike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, lad, what brings thee hither?\"\r\n\r\nRobert knew this meant, \"Now then, youngster, what are you up to here,\r\neh?\"--so he said--\r\n\r\n\"If you please, I want to go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then!\" said the man in the longest boots; \"none hindereth, and\r\nnought lets us to follow. Zooks!\" he added in a cautious undertone, \"I\r\nmisdoubt me but he beareth tidings to the besieged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where dwellest thou, young knave?\" inquired the man with the largest\r\nsteel-cap.\r\n\r\n\"Over there,\" said Robert; and directly he had said it he knew he ought\r\nto have said \"Yonder!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha--sayest so?\" rejoined the longest boots. \"Come hither, boy. This is\r\nmatter for our leader.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to the leader Robert was dragged forthwith--by the reluctant ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert was dragged forthwith--by the reluctant ear]\r\n\r\nThe leader was the most glorious creature Robert had ever seen. He was\r\nexactly like the pictures Robert had so often admired in the historical\r\nromances. He had armor, and a helmet, and a horse, and a crest, and\r\nfeathers, and a shield and a lance and a sword. His armor and his\r\nweapons were all, I am almost sure, of quite different periods. The\r\nshield was thirteenth century, while the sword was of the pattern\r\nused in the Peninsular War. The cuirass was of the time of Charles I.,\r\nand the helmet dated from the Second Crusade. The arms on the shield\r\nwere very grand--three red running lions on a blue ground. The tents\r\nwere of the latest brand approved of by our modern War Office, and the\r\nwhole appearance of camp, army, and leader might have been a shock to\r\nsome. But Robert was dumb with admiration, and it all seemed to him\r\nperfectly correct, because he knew no more of heraldry or archæology\r\nthan the gifted artists who usually drew the pictures for the historical\r\nromances. The scene was indeed \"exactly like a picture.\" He admired it\r\nall so much that he felt braver than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, lad,\" said the glorious leader, when the men in\r\nCromwellian steel-caps had said a few low eager words. And he took off\r\nhis helmet, because he could not see properly with it on. He had a kind\r\nface, and long fair hair. \"Have no fear; thou shalt take no scathe,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nRobert was glad of that. He wondered what \"scathe\" was, and if it was\r\nnastier than the medicine which he had to take sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"Unfold thy tale without alarm,\" said the leader kindly. \"Whence comest\r\nthou, and what is thine intent?\"\r\n\r\n\"My what?\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"What seekest thou to accomplish? What is thine errand, that thou\r\nwanderest here alone among these rough men-at-arms? Poor child, thy\r\nmother's heart aches for thee e'en now, I'll warrant me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" said Robert; \"you see, she doesn't know I'm out.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He wiped away a manly tear]\r\n\r\nThe leader wiped away a manly tear, exactly as a leader in a historical\r\nromance would have done, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Fear not to speak the truth, my child; thou hast nought to fear from\r\nWulfric de Talbot.\"\r\n\r\nRobert had a wild feeling that this glorious leader of the besieging\r\nparty--being himself part of a wish--would be able to understand better\r\nthan Martha, or the gipsies, or the policeman in Rochester, or the\r\nclergyman of yesterday, the true tale of the wishes and the Psammead.\r\nThe only difficulty was that he knew he could never remember enough\r\n\"quothas\" and \"beshrew me's,\" and things like that, to make his talk\r\nsound like the talk of a boy in a historical romance. However, he began\r\nboldly enough, with a sentence straight out of _Ralph de Courcy; or, The\r\nBoy Crusader_. He said--\r\n\r\n\"Grammercy for thy courtesy, fair sir knight. The fact is, it's like\r\nthis--and I hope you're not in a hurry, because the story's rather a\r\nbreather. Father and mother are away, and when we went down playing in\r\nthe sand-pits we found a Psammead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cry thee mercy! A Sammyadd?\" said the knight.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a sort of--of fairy, or enchanter--yes, that's it, an enchanter;\r\nand he said we could have a wish every day, and we wished first to be\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thy wish was scarce granted,\" muttered one of the men-at-arms, looking\r\nat Robert, who went on as if he had not heard, though he thought the\r\nremark very rude indeed.\r\n\r\n\"And then we wished for money--treasure, you know; but we couldn't spend\r\nit. And yesterday we wished for wings, and we got them, and we had a\r\nripping time to begin with\"--\r\n\r\n\"Thy speech is strange and uncouth,\" said Sir Wulfric de Talbot. \"Repeat\r\nthy words--what hadst thou?\"\r\n\r\n\"A ripping--I mean a jolly--no--we were contented with our lot--that's\r\nwhat I mean; only, after we got into an awful fix.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a fix? A fray, mayhap?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not a fray. A--a--a tight place.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dungeon? Alas for thy youthful fettered limbs!\" said the knight, with\r\npolite sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't a dungeon. We just--just encountered undeserved misfortunes,\"\r\nRobert explained, \"and to-day we are punished by not being allowed to go\r\nout. That's where I live,\"--he pointed to the castle. \"The others are in\r\nthere, and they're not allowed to go out. It's all the Psammead's--I\r\nmean the enchanter's fault. I wish we'd never seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is an enchanter of might?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes--of might and main. Rather!\"\r\n\r\n\"And thou deemest that it is the spells of the enchanter whom thou hast\r\nangered that have lent strength to the besieging party,\" said the\r\ngallant leader; \"but know thou that Wulfric de Talbot needs no\r\nenchanter's aid to lead his followers to victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm sure you don't,\" said Robert, with hasty courtesy; \"of course\r\nnot--you wouldn't, you know. But, all the same, it's partly his fault,\r\nbut we're most to blame. You couldn't have done anything if it hadn't\r\nbeen for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How now, bold boy?\" asked Sir Wulfric haughtily. \"Thy speech is dark,\r\nand eke scarce courteous. Unravel me this riddle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Robert desperately, \"of course you don't know it, but you're\r\nnot _real_ at all. You're only here because the others must have been\r\nidiots enough to wish for a castle--and when the sun sets you'll just\r\nvanish away, and it'll be all right.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain and the men-at-arms exchanged glances at first pitying, and\r\nthen sterner, as the longest-booted man said, \"Beware, my noble lord;\r\nthe urchin doth but feign madness to escape from our clutches. Shall we\r\nnot bind him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm no more mad than you are,\" said Robert angrily, \"perhaps not so\r\nmuch--Only, I was an idiot to think you'd understand anything. Let me\r\ngo--I haven't done anything to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither?\" asked the knight, who seemed to have believed all the\r\nenchanter story till it came to his own share in it. \"Whither wouldst\r\nthou wend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Home, of course.\" Robert pointed to the castle.\r\n\r\n\"To carry news of succor? Nay!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" said Robert, struck by a sudden idea; \"then let me go\r\nsomewhere else.\" His mind sought eagerly among the memories of the\r\nhistorical romance.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Wulfric de Talbot,\" he said slowly, \"should think foul scorn to--to\r\nkeep a chap--I mean one who has done him no hurt--when he wants to cut\r\noff quietly--I mean to depart without violence.\"\r\n\r\n\"This to my face! Beshrew thee for a knave!\" replied Sir Wulfric. But\r\nthe appeal seemed to have gone home. \"Yet thou sayest sooth,\" he added\r\nthoughtfully. \"Go where thou wilt,\" he added nobly, \"thou art free.\r\nWulfric de Talbot warreth not with babes, and Jakin here shall bear thee\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Robert wildly. \"Jakin will enjoy himself, I think.\r\nCome on, Jakin. Sir Wulfric, I salute thee.\"\r\n\r\nHe saluted after the modern military manner, and set off running to the\r\nsand-pit, Jakin's long boots keeping up easily.\r\n\r\nHe found the Fairy. He dug it up, he woke it up, he implored it to give\r\nhim one more wish.\r\n\r\n\"I've done two to-day already,\" it grumbled, \"and one was as stiff a bit\r\nof work as ever I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do, do, do, do, _do_!\" said Robert, while Jakin looked on with an\r\nexpression of open-mouthed horror at the strange beast that talked, and\r\ngazed with its snail's eyes at him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Oh, do, do, _do_!\" said Robert]\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" snapped the Psammead, with cross sleepiness.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I was with the others,\" said Robert. And the Psammead began to\r\nswell. Robert never thought of wishing the castle and the siege away. Of\r\ncourse he knew they had all come out of a wish, but swords and daggers\r\nand pikes and lances seemed much too real to be wished away. Robert lost\r\nconsciousness for an instant. When he opened his eyes the others were\r\ncrowding round him.\r\n\r\n\"We never heard you come in,\" they said. \"How awfully jolly of you to\r\nwish it to give us our wish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we understood that was what you'd done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you ought to have told us. Suppose we'd wished something silly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly?\" said Robert, very crossly indeed. \"How much sillier could you\r\nhave been, I'd like to know? You nearly settled _me_--I can tell\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThen he told his story, and the others admitted that it certainly had\r\nbeen rough on him. But they praised his courage and cleverness so much\r\nthat he presently got back his lost temper, and felt braver than ever,\r\nand consented to be captain of the besieged force.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't done anything yet,\" said Anthea comfortably; \"we waited for\r\nyou. We're going to shoot at them through these little loopholes with\r\nthe bow and arrows uncle gave you, and you shall have first shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I would,\" said Robert cautiously; \"you don't know what\r\nthey're like near to. They've got _real_ bows and arrows--an awful\r\nlength--and swords and pikes and daggers, and all sorts of sharp things.\r\nThey're all quite, quite real. It's not just a--a picture, or a vision\r\nor anything; they can _hurt us_--or kill us even, I shouldn't wonder. I\r\ncan feel my ear all sore yet. Look here--have you explored the castle?\r\nBecause I think we'd better let them alone as long as they let us alone.\r\nI heard that Jakin man say they weren't going to attack till just\r\nbefore sundown. We can be getting ready for the attack. Are there any\r\nsoldiers in the castle to defend it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know,\" said Cyril. \"You see, directly I'd wished we were in a\r\nbesieged castle, everything seemed to go upside down, and when it came\r\nstraight we looked out of the window, and saw the camp and things and\r\nyou--and of course we kept on looking at everything. Isn't this room\r\njolly? It's as real as real!\"\r\n\r\nIt was. It was square, with stone walls four feet thick, and great beams\r\nfor ceiling. A low door at the corner led to a flight of steps, up and\r\ndown. The children went down; they found themselves in a great arched\r\ngate-house--the enormous doors were shut and barred. There was a window\r\nin a little room at the bottom of the round turret up which the stair\r\nwound, rather larger than the other windows, and looking through it they\r\nsaw that the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down; the moat looked\r\nvery wide and deep. Opposite the great door that led to the moat was\r\nanother great door, with a little door in it. The children went through\r\nthis, and found themselves in a big courtyard, with the great grey walls\r\nof the castle rising dark and heavy on all four sides.\r\n\r\nNear the middle of the courtyard stood Martha, moving her right hand\r\nbackwards and forwards in the air. The cook was stooping down and moving\r\nher hands, also in a very curious way. But the oddest and at the same\r\ntime most terrible thing was the Lamb, who was sitting on nothing, about\r\nthree feet from the ground, laughing happily.\r\n\r\nThe children ran towards him. Just as Anthea was reaching out her arms\r\nto take him, Martha said crossly, \"Let him alone--do, miss, when he _is_\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what's he _doing_?\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Doing? Why, a-setting in his high chair as good as gold, a precious,\r\nwatching me doing of the ironing. Get along with you, do--my iron's cold\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nShe went towards the cook, and seemed to poke an invisible fire with an\r\nunseen poker--the cook seemed to be putting an unseen dish into an\r\ninvisible oven.\r\n\r\n\"Run along with you, do,\" she said; \"I'm behindhand as it is. You won't\r\nget no dinner if you come a-hindering of me like this. Come, off you\r\ngoes, or I'll pin a discloth to some of your tails.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're _sure_ the Lamb's all right?\" asked Jane anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Right as ninepence, if you don't come unsettling of him. I thought\r\nyou'd like to be rid of him for to-day; but take him, if you want him,\r\nfor gracious' sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" they said, and hastened away. They would have to defend the\r\ncastle presently, and the Lamb was safer even suspended in mid air in an\r\ninvisible kitchen than in the guard-room of the besieged castle. They\r\nwent through the first doorway they came to, and sat down helplessly on\r\na wooden bench that ran along the room inside.\r\n\r\n\"How awful!\" said Anthea and Jane together; and Jane added, \"I feel as\r\nif I was in a lunatic asylum.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\" Anthea said. \"It's creepy; I don't like it. I wish\r\nwe'd wished for something plain--a rocking-horse, or a donkey, or\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use wishing _now_,\" said Robert bitterly; and Cyril said--\r\n\r\n\"Do be quiet; I want to think.\"\r\n\r\nHe buried his face in his hands, and the others looked about them. They\r\nwere in a long room with an arched roof. There were wooden tables along\r\nit, and one across at the end of the room, on a sort of raised platform.\r\nThe room was very dim and dark. The floor was strewn with dry things\r\nlike sticks, and they did not smell nice.\r\n\r\nCyril sat up suddenly and said--\r\n\r\n\"Look here--it's all right. I think it's like this. You know, we wished\r\nthat the servants shouldn't notice any difference when we got wishes.\r\nAnd nothing happens to the Lamb unless we specially wish it to. So of\r\ncourse they don't notice the castle or anything. But then the castle is\r\non the same place where our house was--is, I mean--and the servants have\r\nto go on being in the house, or else they _would_ notice. But you can't\r\nhave a castle mixed up with our house--and so _we_ can't see the house,\r\nbecause we see the castle; and they can't see the castle, because they\r\ngo on seeing the house; and so\"--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _don't_,\" said Jane; \"you make my head go all swimmy, like being on\r\na roundabout. It doesn't matter! Only, I hope we shall be able to see\r\nour dinner, that's all--because if it's invisible it'll be unfeelable as\r\nwell, and then we can't eat it! I _know_ it will, because I tried to\r\nfeel if I could feel the Lamb's chair and there was nothing under him at\r\nall but air. And we can't eat air, and I feel just as if I hadn't had\r\nany breakfast for years and years.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use thinking about it,\" said Anthea. \"Let's go on exploring.\r\nPerhaps we might find something to eat.\"\r\n\r\nThis lighted hope in every breast, and they went on exploring the\r\ncastle. But though it was the most perfect and delightful castle you can\r\npossibly imagine, and furnished in the most complete and beautiful\r\nmanner, neither food nor men-at-arms were to be found in it.\r\n\r\n\"If you'd only thought of wishing to be besieged in a castle thoroughly\r\ngarrisoned and provisioned!\" said Jane reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"You can't think of everything, you know,\" said Anthea. \"I should think\r\nit must be nearly dinner-time by now.\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't; but they hung about watching the strange movements of the\r\nservants in the middle of the courtyard, because, of course, they\r\ncouldn't be sure where the dining-room of the invisible house was.\r\nPresently they saw Martha carrying an invisible tray across the\r\ncourtyard, for it seemed that, by the most fortunate accident, the\r\ndining-room of the house and the banqueting-hall of the castle were in\r\nthe same place. But oh, how their hearts sank when they perceived that\r\nthe tray _was_ invisible!\r\n\r\nThey waited in wretched silence while Martha went through the form of\r\ncarving an unseen leg of mutton and serving invisible greens and\r\npotatoes with a spoon that no one could see. When she had left the room,\r\nthe children looked at the empty table, and then at each other.\r\n\r\n\"This is worse than anything,\" said Robert, who had not till now been\r\nparticularly keen on his dinner.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so very hungry,\" said Anthea, trying to make the best of\r\nthings, as usual.\r\n\r\nCyril tightened his belt ostentatiously. Jane burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA SIEGE AND BED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children were sitting in the gloomy banqueting-hall, at the end of\r\none of the long bare wooden tables. There was now no hope. Martha had\r\nbrought in the dinner, and the dinner was invisible, and unfeelable too;\r\nfor, when they rubbed their hands along the table, they knew but too\r\nwell that for them there was nothing there _but_ table.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Cyril felt in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Right, _oh_!\" he cried. \"Look here! Biscuits.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat broken and crumbled, certainly, but still biscuits. Three whole\r\nones, and a generous handful of crumbs and fragments.\r\n\r\n\"I got them this morning--cook--and I'd quite forgotten,\" he explained\r\nas he divided them with scrupulous fairness into four heaps.\r\n\r\nThey were eaten in a happy silence, though they had an odd taste,\r\nbecause they had been in Cyril's pocket all the morning with a hank of\r\ntarred twine, some green fir-cones, and a ball of cobbler's wax.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but look here, Squirrel,\" said Robert; \"you're so clever at\r\nexplaining about invisibleness and all that. How is it the biscuits are\r\nhere, and all the bread and meat and things have disappeared?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Cyril after a pause, \"unless it's because _we_ had\r\nthem. Nothing about _us_ has changed. Everything's in my pocket all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if we _had_ the mutton it would be real,\" said Robert. \"Oh, don't\r\nI wish we could find it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't find it. I suppose it isn't ours till we've got it in our\r\nmouths.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or in our pockets,\" said Jane, thinking of the biscuits.\r\n\r\n\"Who puts mutton in their pockets, goose-girl?\" said Cyril. \"But I\r\nknow--at any rate, I'll try it!\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned over the table with his face about an inch from it, and kept\r\nopening and shutting his mouth as if he were taking bites out of air.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good,\" said Robert in deep dejection. \"You'll only---- Hullo!\"\r\n\r\nCyril stood up with a grin of triumph, holding a square piece of bread\r\nin his mouth. It was quite real. Everyone saw it. It is true that,\r\ndirectly he bit a piece off, the rest vanished; but it was all right,\r\nbecause he knew he had it in his hand though he could neither see nor\r\nfeel it. He took another bite from the air between his fingers, and it\r\nturned into bread as he bit. The next moment all the others were\r\nfollowing his example, and opening and shutting their mouths an inch or\r\nso from the bare-looking table. Robert captured a slice of mutton,\r\nand--but I think I will draw a veil over the rest of this painful scene.\r\nIt is enough to say that they all had enough mutton, and that when\r\nMartha came to change the plates she said she had never seen such a mess\r\nin all her born days.\r\n\r\nThe pudding was, fortunately, a plain suet one, and in answer to\r\nMartha's questions the children all with one accord said that they would\r\n_not_ have molasses on it--nor jam, nor sugar--\"Just plain, please,\"\r\nthey said. Martha said, \"Well, I never--what next, I wonder!\" and went\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThen ensued another scene on which I will not dwell, for nobody looks\r\nnice picking up slices of suet pudding from the table in its mouth, like\r\na dog.\r\n\r\nThe great thing, after all, was that they had had dinner; and now\r\neveryone felt more courage to prepare for the attack that was to be\r\ndelivered before sunset. Robert, as captain, insisted on climbing to the\r\ntop of one of the towers to reconnoitre, so up they all went. And now\r\nthey could see all round the castle, and could see, too, that beyond the\r\nmoat, on every side, tents of the besieging party were pitched. Rather\r\nuncomfortable shivers ran down the children's backs as they saw that all\r\nthe men were very busy cleaning or sharpening their arms, re-stringing\r\ntheir bows, and polishing their shields. A large party came along the\r\nroad, with horses dragging along the great trunk of a tree; and Cyril\r\nfelt quite pale, because he knew this was for a battering-ram.\r\n\r\n\"What a good thing we've got a moat,\" he said; \"and what a good thing\r\nthe drawbridge is up--I should never have known how to work it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it would be up in a besieged castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd think there ought to have been soldiers in it, wouldn't you?\"\r\nsaid Robert.\r\n\r\n\"You see you don't know how long it's been besieged,\" said Cyril darkly;\r\n\"perhaps most of the brave defenders were killed early in the siege and\r\nall the provisions eaten, and now there are only a few intrepid\r\nsurvivors,--that's us, and we are going to defend it to the death.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you begin--defending to the death, I mean?\" asked Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to be heavily armed--and then shoot at them when they advance\r\nto the attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"They used to pour boiling lead down on besiegers when they got too\r\nclose,\" said Anthea. \"Father showed me the holes on purpose for pouring\r\nit down through at Bodiam Castle. And there are holes like it in the\r\ngate-tower here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'm glad it's only a game; it _is_ only a game, isn't it?\" said\r\nJane.\r\n\r\nBut no one answered.\r\n\r\nThe children found plenty of strange weapons in the castle, and if they\r\nwere armed at all it was soon plain that they would be, as Cyril said,\r\n\"armed heavily\"--for these swords and lances and crossbows were far too\r\nweighty even for Cyril's manly strength; and as for the longbows, none\r\nof the children could even begin to bend them. The daggers were better;\r\nbut Jane hoped that the besiegers would not come close enough for\r\ndaggers to be of any use.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, we can hurl them like javelins,\" said Cyril, \"or drop them\r\non people's heads. I say--there are lots of stones on the other side of\r\nthe courtyard. If we took some of those up? Just to drop on their heads\r\nif they were to try swimming the moat.\"\r\n\r\nSo a heap of stones grew apace, up in the room above the gate; and\r\nanother heap, a shiny spiky dangerous-looking heap, of daggers and\r\nknives.\r\n\r\nAs Anthea was crossing the courtyard for more stones, a sudden and\r\nvaluable idea came to her.\r\n\r\nShe went to Martha and said, \"May we have just biscuits for tea? We're\r\ngoing to play at besieged castles, and we'd like the biscuits to\r\nprovision the garrison. Put mine in my pocket, please, my hands are so\r\ndirty. And I'll tell the others to fetch theirs.\"\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a happy thought, for now with four generous handfuls of\r\nair, which turned to biscuits as Martha crammed it into their pockets,\r\nthe garrison was well provisioned till sundown.\r\n\r\nThey brought up some iron pots of cold water to pour on the besiegers\r\ninstead of hot lead, with which the castle did not seem to be provided.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon passed with wonderful quickness. It was very exciting; but\r\nnone of them, except Robert, could feel all the time that this was real\r\ndeadly dangerous work. To the others, who had only seen the camp and the\r\nbesiegers from a distance, the whole thing seemed half a game of\r\nmake-believe, and half a splendidly distinct and perfectly safe dream.\r\nBut it was only now and then that Robert could feel this.\r\n\r\nWhen it seemed to be tea-time the biscuits were eaten, with water from\r\nthe deep well in the courtyard, drunk out of horns. Cyril insisted on\r\nputting by eight of the biscuits, in case anyone should feel faint in\r\nstress of battle.\r\n\r\nJust as he was putting away the reserve biscuits in a sort of little\r\nstone cupboard without a door, a sudden sound made him drop three. It\r\nwas the loud fierce cry of a trumpet.\r\n\r\n\"You see it _is_ real,\" said Robert, \"and they are going to attack.\"\r\n\r\nAll rushed to the narrow windows.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Robert, \"they're all coming out of their tents and moving\r\nabout like ants. There's that Jakin dancing about where the bridge\r\njoins on. I wish he could see me put my tongue out at him! Yah!\"\r\n\r\nThe others were far too pale to wish to put their tongues out at\r\nanybody. They looked at Robert with surprised respect. Anthea said--\r\n\r\n\"You really _are_ brave, Robert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rot!\" Cyril's pallor turned to redness now, all in a minute. \"He's been\r\ngetting ready to be brave all the afternoon. And I wasn't ready, that's\r\nall. I shall be braver than he is in half a jiffy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" said Jane, \"what does it matter which of you is the bravest?\r\nI think Cyril was a perfect silly to wish for a castle, and I don't want\r\nto play.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _isn't_\"--Robert was beginning sternly, but Anthea interrupted--\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you do,\" she said coaxingly; \"it's a very nice game, really,\r\nbecause they can't possibly get in, and if they do the women and\r\nchildren are always spared by civilised armies.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you quite, quite sure they _are_ civilised?\" asked Jane,\r\npanting. \"They seem to be such a long time ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they are.\" Anthea pointed cheerfully through the narrow\r\nwindow. \"Why, look at the little flags on their lances, how bright they\r\nare--and how fine the leader is! Look, that's him--isn't it, Robert?--on\r\nthe gray horse.\"\r\n\r\nJane consented to look, and the scene was almost too pretty to be\r\nalarming. The green turf, the white tents, the flash of pennoned lances,\r\nthe gleam of armour, and the bright colours of scarf and tunic--it was\r\njust like a splendid coloured picture. The trumpets were sounding, and\r\nwhen the trumpeters stopped for breath the children could hear the\r\ncling-clang of armour and the murmur of voices.\r\n\r\nA trumpeter came forward to the edge of the moat, which now seemed very\r\nmuch narrower than at first, and blew the longest and loudest blast they\r\nhad yet heard. When the blaring noise had died away, a man who was with\r\nthe trumpeter shouted--\r\n\r\n\"What ho, within there!\" and his voice came plainly to the garrison in\r\nthe gate-house.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo there!\" Robert bellowed back at once.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of our Lord the King, and of our good lord and trusty\r\nleader Sir Wulfric de Talbot, we summon this castle to surrender--on\r\npain of fire and sword and no quarter. Do ye surrender?\"\r\n\r\n\"_No_\" bawled Robert; \"of course we don't! Never, _Never, NEVER_!\"\r\n\r\nThe man answered back--\r\n\r\n\"Then your fate be on your own heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheer,\" said Robert in a fierce whisper. \"Cheer to show them we aren't\r\nafraid, and rattle the daggers to make more noise. One, two, three! Hip,\r\nhip, hooray! Again--Hip, hip, hooray! One more--Hip, hip, hooray!\" The\r\ncheers were rather high and weak, but the rattle of the daggers lent\r\nthem strength and depth.\r\n\r\nThere was another shout from the camp across the moat--and then the\r\nbeleaguered fortress felt that the attack had indeed begun.\r\n\r\nIt was getting rather dark in the room above the great gate, and Jane\r\ntook a very little courage as she remembered that sunset _couldn't_ be\r\nfar off now.\r\n\r\n\"The moat is dreadfully thin,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"But they can't get into the castle even if they do swim over,\" said\r\nRobert. And as he spoke he heard feet on the stair outside--heavy feet\r\nand the clang of steel. No one breathed for a moment. The steel and the\r\nfeet went on up the turret stairs. Then Robert sprang softly to the\r\ndoor. He pulled off his shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Wait here,\" he whispered, and stole quickly and softly after the boots\r\nand the spur-clank. He peeped into the upper room. The man was\r\nthere--and it was Jakin, all dripping with moat-water, and he was\r\nfiddling about with the machinery which Robert felt sure worked the\r\ndrawbridge. Robert banged the door suddenly, and turned the great key in\r\nthe lock, just as Jakin sprang to the inside of the door. Then he tore\r\ndownstairs and into the little turret at the foot of the tower where the\r\nbiggest window was.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have defended _this_!\" he cried to the others as they\r\nfollowed him. He was just in time. Another man had swum over, and his\r\nfingers were on the window-ledge. Robert never knew how the man had\r\nmanaged to climb up out of the water. But he saw the clinging fingers,\r\nand hit them as hard as he could with an iron bar that he caught up from\r\nthe floor. The man fell with a splash into the moat-water. In another\r\nmoment Robert was outside the little room, had banged its door and was\r\nshooting home the enormous bolts, and calling to Cyril to lend a hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The man fell with a splash into the moat-water]\r\n\r\nThen they stood in the arched gate-house, breathing hard and looking at\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nJane's mouth was open.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, Jenny,\" said Robert,--\"it won't last much longer.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a creaking above, and something rattled and shook. The\r\npavement they stood on seemed to tremble. Then a crash told them that\r\nthe drawbridge had been lowered to its place.\r\n\r\n\"That's that beast Jakin,\" said Robert. \"There's still the portcullis;\r\nI'm almost certain that's worked from lower down.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the drawbridge rang and echoed hollowly to the hoofs of horses\r\nand the tramp of armed men.\r\n\r\n\"Up--quick!\" cried Robert,--\"let's drop things on them.\"\r\n\r\nEven the girls were feeling almost brave now. They followed Robert\r\nquickly, and under his directions began to drop stones out through the\r\nlong narrow windows. There was a confused noise below, and some groans.\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" said Anthea, putting down the stone she was just going to\r\ndrop out, \"I'm afraid we've hurt somebody!\"\r\n\r\nRobert caught up the stone in a fury.\r\n\r\n\"I should hope we _had_!\" he said; \"I'd give something for a jolly good\r\nboiling kettle of lead. Surrender, indeed!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now came more tramping and a pause, and then the thundering thump of\r\nthe battering-ram. And the little room was almost pitch dark.\r\n\r\n\"We've held it,\" cried Robert, \"we _won't_ surrender! The sun _must_ set\r\nin a minute. Here--they're all jawing underneath again. Pity there's no\r\ntime to get more stones! Here, pour that water down on them. It's no\r\ngood, of course, but they'll hate it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" said Jane, \"don't you think we'd better surrender?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" said Robert; \"we'll have a parley if you like, but we'll never\r\nsurrender. Oh, I'll be a soldier when I grow up--you just see if I\r\ndon't. I won't go into the Civil Service, whatever anyone says.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's wave a handkerchief and ask for a parley,\" Jane pleaded. \"I don't\r\nbelieve the sun's going to set to-night at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give them the water first--the brutes!\" said the bloodthirsty Robert.\r\nSo Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole, and poured. They\r\nheard a splash below, but no one below seemed to have felt it. And again\r\nthe ram battered the great door. Anthea paused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole]\r\n\r\n\"How idiotic,\" said Robert, lying flat on the floor and putting one eye\r\nto the lead-hole. \"Of course the holes go straight down into the\r\ngate-house--that's for when the enemy has got past the door and the\r\nportcullis, and almost all is lost. Here, hand me the pot.\" He crawled\r\non to the three-cornered window-ledge in the middle of the wall, and,\r\ntaking the pot from Anthea, poured the water out through the arrow-slit.\r\n\r\nAnd as he began to pour, the noise of the battering-ram and the\r\ntrampling of the foe and the shouts of \"Surrender!\" and \"De Talbot for\r\never!\" all suddenly stopped and went out like the snuff of a candle; the\r\nlittle dark room seemed to whirl round and turn topsy-turvy, and when\r\nthe children came to themselves there they were, safe and sound, in the\r\nbig front bedroom of their own house--the house with the ornamental\r\nnightmare iron-top to the roof.\r\n\r\nThey all crowded to the window and looked out. The moat and the tents\r\nand the besieging force were all gone--and there was the garden with its\r\ntangle of dahlias and marigolds and asters and later roses, and the\r\nspiky iron railings and the quiet white road.\r\n\r\nEveryone drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"And that's all right!\" said Robert. \"I told you so! And, I say, we\r\ndidn't surrender, did we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you glad now I wished for a castle?\" asked Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"I think I am _now_,\" said Anthea slowly. \"But I wouldn't wish for it\r\nagain, I think, Squirrel dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was simply splendid!\" said Jane unexpectedly. \"I wasn't\r\nfrightened a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say!\" Cyril was beginning, but Anthea stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" she said, \"it's just come into my head. This is the very\r\nfirst thing we've wished for that hasn't got us into a row. And there\r\nhasn't been the least little scrap of a row about this. Nobody's raging\r\ndownstairs, we're safe and sound, we've had an awfully jolly day--at\r\nleast, not jolly exactly, but you know what I mean. And we know now how\r\nbrave Robert is--and Cyril too, of course,\" she added hastily, \"and\r\nJane as well. And we haven't got into a row with a single grown-up.\"\r\n\r\nThe door was opened suddenly and fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,\" said the voice of Martha, and\r\nthey could tell by her voice that she was very angry indeed. \"I thought\r\nyou couldn't last through the day without getting up to some mischief! A\r\nperson can't take a breath of air on the front doorstep but you must be\r\nemptying the water jug on their heads! Off you go to bed, the lot of\r\nyou, and try to get up better children in the morning. Now then--don't\r\nlet me have to tell you twice. If I find any of you not in bed in ten\r\nminutes I'll let you know it, that's all! A new cap, and everything!\"\r\n\r\nShe flounced out amid a disregarded chorus of regrets and apologies. The\r\nchildren were very sorry, but really it was not their faults.\r\n\r\nYou can't help it if you are pouring water on a besieging foe, and your\r\ncastle suddenly changes into your house--and everything changes with it\r\nexcept the water, and that happens to fall on somebody else's clean cap.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why the water didn't change into nothing, though,\" said\r\nCyril.\r\n\r\n\"Why should it?\" asked Robert. \"Water's water all the world over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect the castle well was the same as ours in the stable-yard,\" said\r\nJane. And that was really the case.\r\n\r\n\"I thought we couldn't get through a wish-day without a row,\" said\r\nCyril; \"it was much too good to be true. Come on, Bobs, my military\r\nhero. If we lick into bed sharp she won't be so furious, and perhaps\r\nshe'll bring us up some supper. I'm jolly hungry! Good-night, kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night. I hope the castle won't come creeping back in the night,\"\r\nsaid Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it won't,\" said Anthea briskly, \"but Martha will--not in the\r\nnight, but in a minute. Here, turn round, I'll get that knot out of your\r\npinafore strings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it have been degrading for Sir Wulfric de Talbot,\" said Jane\r\ndreamily, \"if he could have known that half the besieged garrison wore\r\npinafores?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the other half knickerbockers. Yes--frightfully. Do stand\r\nstill--you're only tightening the knot,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Cyril. \"I've got an idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt much?\" said Robert sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a jackanape! I'm not humbugging.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Bobs!\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Silence for the Squirrel's oration,\" said Robert.\r\n\r\nCyril balanced himself on the edge of the water-butt in the backyard,\r\nwhere they all happened to be, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Friends, Romans, countrymen--and women--we found a Sammyadd. We have\r\nhad wishes. We've had wings, and being beautiful as the day--ugh!--that\r\nwas pretty jolly beastly if you like--and wealth and castles, and that\r\nrotten gipsy business with the Lamb. But we're no forrarder. We haven't\r\nreally got anything worth having for our wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've had things happening,\" said Robert; \"that's always something.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not enough, unless they're the right things,\" said Cyril firmly.\r\n\"Now I've been thinking\"--\r\n\r\n\"Not really?\" whispered Robert.\r\n\r\n\"In the silent what's-its-names of the night. It's like suddenly being\r\nasked something out of history--the date of the Conquest or something;\r\nyou know it all right all the time, but when you're asked it all goes\r\nout of your head. Ladies and gentlemen, you know jolly well that when\r\nwe're all rotting about in the usual way heaps of things keep cropping\r\nup, and then real earnest wishes come into the heads of the beholder\"--\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"--of the beholder, however, stupid he is,\" Cyril went on. \"Why, even\r\nRobert might happen to think of a really useful wish if he didn't injure\r\nhis poor little brains trying so hard to think.--Shut up, Bobs, I tell\r\nyou!--You'll have the whole show over.\"\r\n\r\nA struggle on the edge of a water-butt is exciting but damp. When it was\r\nover, and the boys were partially dried, Anthea said--\r\n\r\n\"It really was you began it, Bobs. Now honour is satisfied, do let\r\nSquirrel go on. We're wasting the whole morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Cyril, still wringing the water out of the tails of\r\nhis jacket, \"I'll call it pax if Bobs will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pax then,\" said Robert sulkily. \"But I've got a lump as big as a\r\ncricket ball over my eye.\"\r\n\r\nAnthea patiently offered a dust-coloured handkerchief, and Robert bathed\r\nhis wounds in silence. \"Now, Squirrel,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Well then--let's just play bandits, or forts, or soldiers, or any of\r\nthe old games. We're dead sure to think of something if we try not to.\r\nYou always do.\"\r\n\r\nThe others consented. Bandits was hastily chosen for the game. \"It's as\r\ngood as anything else,\" said Jane gloomily. It must be owned that\r\nRobert was at first but a half-hearted bandit, but when Anthea had\r\nborrowed from Martha the red-spotted handkerchief in which the keeper\r\nhad brought her mushrooms that morning, and had tied up Robert's head\r\nwith it so that he could be the wounded hero who had saved the bandit\r\ncaptain's life the day before, he cheered up wonderfully. All were soon\r\narmed. Bows and arrows slung on the back look well; and umbrellas and\r\ncricket stumps through the belt give a fine impression of the wearer's\r\nbeing armed to the teeth. The white cotton hats that men wear in the\r\ncountry nowadays have a very brigandish effect when a few turkey's\r\nfeathers are stuck in them. The Lamb's mail-cart was covered with a\r\nred-and-blue checked table-cloth, and made an admirable baggage-wagon.\r\nThe Lamb asleep inside it was not at all in the way. So the banditti set\r\nout along the road that led to the sand-pit.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to be near the Sammyadd,\" said Cyril, \"in case we think of\r\nanything suddenly.\"\r\n\r\nIt is all very well to make up your minds to play bandit--or chess, or\r\nping-pong, or any other agreeable game--but it is not easy to do it with\r\nspirit when all the wonderful wishes you can think of, or can't think\r\nof, are waiting for you round the corner. The game was dragging a\r\nlittle, and some of the bandits were beginning to feel that the others\r\nwere disagreeable things, and were saying so candidly, when the baker's\r\nboy came along the road with loaves in a basket. The opportunity was not\r\none to be lost.\r\n\r\n\"Stand and deliver!\" cried Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"Your money or your life!\" said Robert.\r\n\r\nAnd they stood on each side of the baker's boy. Unfortunately, he did\r\nnot seem to enter into the spirit of the thing at all. He was a baker's\r\nboy of an unusually large size. He merely said--\r\n\r\n\"Chuck it now, d'ye hear!\" and pushed the bandits aside most\r\ndisrespectfully.\r\n\r\nThen Robert lassoed him with Jane's skipping-rope, and instead of going\r\nround his shoulders, as Robert intended, it went round his feet and\r\ntripped him up. The basket was upset, the beautiful new loaves went\r\nbumping and bouncing all over the dusty chalky road. The girls ran to\r\npick them up, and all in a moment Robert and the baker's boy were\r\nfighting it out, man to man, with Cyril to see fair play, and the\r\nskipping-rope twisting round their legs like an interesting snake that\r\nwished to be a peace-maker. It did not succeed; indeed the way the\r\nboxwood handles sprang up and hit the fighters on the shins and ankles\r\nwas not at all peace-making. I know this is the second fight--or\r\ncontest--in this chapter, but I can't help it. It was that sort of day.\r\nYou know yourself there are days when rows seem to keep on happening,\r\nquite without your meaning them to. If I were a writer of tales of\r\nadventure such as those which used to appear in _The Boys of England_\r\nwhen I was young of course I should be able to describe the fight, but I\r\ncannot do it. I never can see what happens during a fight, even when it\r\nis only dogs. Also, if I had been one of these _Boys of England_\r\nwriters, Robert would have got the best of it. But I am like George\r\nWashington--I cannot tell a lie, even about a cherry-tree, much less\r\nabout a fight, and I cannot conceal from you that Robert was badly\r\nbeaten, for the second time that day. The baker's boy blacked his other\r\neye, and being ignorant of the first rules of fair play and gentlemanly\r\nbehaviour, he also pulled Robert's hair, and kicked him on the knee.\r\nRobert always used to say he could have licked the baker if it hadn't\r\nbeen for the girls. But I am not sure. Anyway, what happened was this,\r\nand very painful it was to self-respecting boys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He pulled Robert's hair]\r\n\r\nCyril was just tearing off his coat so as to help his brother in proper\r\nstyle, when Jane threw her arms round his legs and began to cry and ask\r\nhim not to go and be beaten too. That \"too\" was very nice for Robert, as\r\nyou can imagine--but it was nothing to what he felt when Anthea rushed\r\nin between him and the baker's boy, and caught that unfair and degraded\r\nfighter round the waist, imploring him not to fight any more.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't hurt my brother any more!\" she said in floods of tears. \"He\r\ndidn't mean it--it's only play. And I'm sure he's very sorry.\"\r\n\r\nYou see how unfair this was to Robert. Because, if the baker's boy had\r\nhad any right and chivalrous instincts, and had yielded to Anthea's\r\npleading and accepted her despicable apology, Robert could not, in\r\nhonour, have done anything to him at any future time. But Robert's\r\nfears, if he had any, were soon dispelled. Chivalry was a stranger to\r\nthe breast of the baker's boy. He pushed Anthea away very roughly, and\r\nhe chased Robert with kicks and unpleasant conversation right down the\r\nroad to the sand-pit, and there, with one last kick, he landed him in a\r\nheap of sand.\r\n\r\n\"I'll larn you, you young varmint!\" he said, and went off to pick up his\r\nloaves and go about his business. Cyril, impeded by Jane, could do\r\nnothing without hurting her, for she clung round his legs with the\r\nstrength of despair. The baker's boy went off red and damp about the\r\nface; abusive to the last, he called them a pack of silly idiots, and\r\ndisappeared round the corner. Then Jane's grasp loosened. Cyril turned\r\naway in silent dignity to follow Robert, and the girls followed him,\r\nweeping without restraint.\r\n\r\nIt was not a happy party that flung itself down in the sand beside the\r\nsobbing Robert. For Robert was sobbing--mostly with rage. Though of\r\ncourse I know that a really heroic boy is always dry-eyed after a fight.\r\nBut then he always wins, which had not been the case with Robert.\r\n\r\nCyril was angry with Jane; Robert was furious with Anthea; the girls\r\nwere miserable; and not one of the four was pleased with the baker's\r\nboy. There was, as French writers say, \"a silence full of emotion.\"\r\n\r\nThen Robert dug his toes and his hands into the sand and wriggled in his\r\nrage. \"He'd better wait till I'm grown up--the cowardly brute! Beast!--I\r\nhate him! But I'll pay him out. Just because he's bigger than me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You began,\" said Jane incautiously.\r\n\r\n\"I know I did, silly--but I was only jollying--and he kicked me--look\r\nhere\"--\r\n\r\nRobert tore down a stocking and showed a purple bruise touched up with\r\nred.\r\n\r\n\"I only wish I was bigger than him, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nHe dug his fingers in the sand, and sprang up, for his hand had touched\r\nsomething furry. It was the Psammead, of course--\"On the look-out to\r\nmake sillies of them as usual,\" as Cyril remarked later. And of course\r\nthe next moment Robert's wish was granted, and he was bigger than the\r\nbaker's boy. Oh, but much, much bigger! He was bigger than the big\r\npoliceman who used to be at the crossing at the Mansion House years\r\nago,--the one who was so kind in helping old ladies over the\r\ncrossing,--and he was the biggest man _I_ have ever seen, as well as the\r\nkindest. No one had a foot-rule in its pocket, so Robert could not be\r\nmeasured--but he was taller than your father would be if he stood on\r\nyour mother's head, which I am sure he would never be unkind enough to\r\ndo. He must have been ten or eleven feet high, and as broad as a boy of\r\nthat height ought to be. His suit had fortunately grown too, and now he\r\nstood up in it--with one of his enormous stockings turned down to show\r\nthe gigantic bruise on his vast leg. Immense tears of fury still stood\r\non his flushed giant face. He looked so surprised, and he was so large\r\nto be wearing a turned down collar outside of his jacket that the others\r\ncould not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The Sammyadd's done us again,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The Sammyadd's done us again,\" said Cyril]\r\n\r\n\"Not us--_me_,\" said Robert. \"If you'd got any decent feeling you'd try\r\nto make it make you the same size. You've no idea how silly it feels,\"\r\nhe added thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\n\"And I don't want to; I can jolly well see how silly it looks,\" Cyril\r\nwas beginning; but Anthea said--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _don't_! I don't know what's the matter with you boys to-day. Look\r\nhere, Squirrel, let's play fair. It is hateful for poor old Bobs, all\r\nalone up there. Let's ask the Sammyadd for another wish, and, if it\r\nwill, I do really think we ought all to be made the same size.\"\r\n\r\nThe others agreed, but not gaily; but when they found the Psammead, it\r\nwouldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" it said crossly, rubbing its face with its feet. \"He's a rude\r\nviolent boy, and it'll do him good to be the wrong size for a bit. What\r\ndid he want to come digging me out with his nasty wet hands for? He\r\nnearly touched me! He's a perfect savage. A boy of the Stone Age would\r\nhave had more sense.\"\r\n\r\nRobert's hands had indeed been wet--with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Go away and leave me in peace, do,\" the Psammead went on. \"I can't\r\nthink why you don't wish for something sensible--something to eat or\r\ndrink, or good manners, or good tempers. Go along with you, do!\"\r\n\r\nIt almost snarled as it shook its whiskers, and turned a sulky brown\r\nback on them. The most hopeful felt that further parley was vain.\r\n\r\nThey turned again to the colossal Robert.\r\n\r\n\"What ever shall we do?\" they said; and they all said it.\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said Robert grimly, \"I'm going to reason with that baker's boy.\r\nI shall catch him at the end of the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't hit a chap smaller than yourself, old man,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"Do I look like hitting him?\" said Robert scornfully. \"Why, I should\r\n_kill_ him. But I'll give him something to remember. Wait till I pull up\r\nmy stocking.\" He pulled up his stocking, which was as large as a small\r\nbolster-case, and strode off. His strides were six or seven feet long,\r\nso that it was quite easy for him to be at the bottom of the hill, ready\r\nto meet the baker's boy when he came down swinging the empty basket to\r\nmeet his master's cart, which had been leaving bread at the cottages\r\nalong the road.\r\n\r\nRobert crouched behind a haystack in the farmyard, that is at the\r\ncorner, and when he heard the boy come whistling along he jumped out at\r\nhim and caught him by the collar.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, and his voice was about four times its usual size, just\r\nas his body was four times its, \"I'm going to teach you to kick boys\r\nsmaller than you.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted up the baker's boy and set him on the top of the haystack,\r\nwhich was about sixteen feet from the ground, and then he sat down on\r\nthe roof of the barn and told the baker's boy exactly what he thought of\r\nhim. I don't think the boy heard it all--he was in a sort of trance of\r\nterror. When Robert had said everything he could think of, and some\r\nthings twice over, he shook the boy and said--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He lifted up the baker's boy and set him on top of the\r\nhaystack]\r\n\r\n\"And now get down the best way you can,\" and left him.\r\n\r\nI don't know how the baker's boy got down, but I do know that he missed\r\nthe cart and got into the very hottest of hot water when he turned up at\r\nlast at the bakehouse. I am sorry for him, but after all, it was quite\r\nright that he should be taught that boys mustn't use their feet when\r\nthey fight, but their fists. Of course the water he got into only became\r\nhotter when he tried to tell his master about the boy he had licked\r\nand the giant as high as a church, because no one could possibly believe\r\nsuch a tale as that. Next day the tale was believed--but that was too\r\nlate to be of any use to the baker's boy.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert rejoined the others he found them in the garden. Anthea had\r\nthoughtfully asked Martha to let them have dinner out there--because the\r\ndining-room was rather small, and it would have been so awkward to have\r\na brother the size of Robert in there. The Lamb, who had slept\r\npeacefully during the whole stormy morning, was now found to be\r\nsneezing, and Martha said he had a cold and would be better indoors.\r\n\r\n\"And really it's just as well,\" said Cyril, \"for I don't believe he'd\r\never have stopped screaming if he'd once seen you, the awful size you\r\nare!\"\r\n\r\nRobert was indeed what a draper would call an \"out-size\" in boys. He\r\nfound himself able to step right over the iron gate in the front\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nMartha brought out the dinner--it was cold veal and baked potatoes, with\r\nsago pudding and stewed plums to follow.\r\n\r\nShe of course did not notice that Robert was anything but the usual\r\nsize, and she gave him as much meat and potatoes as usual and no more.\r\nYou have no idea how small your usual helping of dinner looks when you\r\nare many times your proper size. Robert groaned, and asked for more\r\nbread. But Martha would not go on giving more bread for ever. She was in\r\na hurry, because the keeper intended to call on his way to Benenhurst\r\nFair, and she wished to be smartly dressed before he came.\r\n\r\n\"I wish _we_ were going to the Fair,\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"You can't go anywhere that size,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said Robert. \"They have giants at fairs, much bigger ones\r\nthan me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much, they don't,\" Cyril was beginning, when Jane screamed \"Oh!\"\r\nwith such loud suddenness that they all thumped her on the back and\r\nasked whether she had swallowed a plum-stone.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, breathless from being thumped, \"it's--it's not a\r\nplum-stone. It's an idea. Let's take Robert to the Fair, and get them to\r\ngive us money for showing him! Then we really _shall_ get something out\r\nof the old Sammyadd at last!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take me, indeed!\" said Robert indignantly. \"Much more likely me take\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it turned out. The idea appealed irresistibly to everyone but\r\nRobert, and even he was brought round by Anthea's suggestion that he\r\nshould have a double share of any money they might make. There was a\r\nlittle old pony-cart in the coach-house--the kind that is called a\r\ngoverness-cart. It seemed desirable to get to the Fair as quickly as\r\npossible, so Robert--who could now take enormous steps and so go very\r\nfast indeed--consented to wheel the others in this. It was as easy to\r\nhim now as wheeling the Lamb in the mail-cart had been in the morning.\r\nThe Lamb's cold prevented his being of the party.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sensation being wheeled in a pony-carriage by a giant.\r\nEveryone enjoyed the journey except Robert and the few people they\r\npassed on the way. These mostly went into what looked like some kind of\r\nstanding-up fits by the roadside, as Anthea said. Just outside\r\nBenenhurst, Robert hid in a barn, and the others went on to the Fair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It was a strange sensation being wheeled in a\r\npony-carriage by a giant]\r\n\r\nThere were some swings, and a hooting-tooting blaring merry-go-round,\r\nand a shooting-gallery and Aunt Sallies. Resisting an impulse to win a\r\ncocoanut,--or at least to attempt the enterprise,--Cyril went up to the\r\nwoman who was loading little guns before the array of glass bottles on\r\nstrings against a sheet of canvas.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, little gentleman!\" she said. \"Penny a shot!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you,\" said Cyril, \"we are here on business, not on pleasure.\r\nWho's the master?\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The master--the head--the boss of the show.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over there,\" she said, pointing to a stout man in a dirty linen jacket\r\nwho was sleeping in the sun; \"but I don't advise you to wake him sudden.\r\nHis temper's contrairy, especially these hot days. Better have a shot\r\nwhile you're waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather important,\" said Cyril. \"It'll be very profitable to him. I\r\nthink he'll be sorry if we take it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if it's money in his pocket,\" said the woman. \"No kid now? What is\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a _giant_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ kidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along and see,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\nThe woman looked doubtfully at them, then she called to a ragged little\r\ngirl in striped stockings and a dingy white petticoat that came below\r\nher brown frock, and leaving her in charge of the \"shooting-gallery\" she\r\nturned to Anthea and said, \"Well, hurry up! But if you _are_ kidding,\r\nyou'd best say so. I'm as mild as milk myself, but my Bill he's a fair\r\nterror and\"--\r\n\r\nAnthea led the way to the barn. \"It really _is_ a giant,\" she said.\r\n\"He's a giant little boy--in a suit like my brother's there. And we\r\ndidn't bring him up to the Fair because people do stare so, and they\r\nseem to go into kind of standing-up fits when they see him. And we\r\nthought perhaps you'd like to show him and get pennies; and if you like\r\nto pay us something, you can--only, it'll have to be rather a lot,\r\nbecause we promised him he should have a double share of whatever we\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman murmured something indistinct, of which the children could\r\nonly hear the words, \"Swelp me!\" \"balmy,\" and \"crumpet,\" which conveyed\r\nno definite idea to their minds.\r\n\r\nShe had taken Anthea's hand, and was holding it very firmly; and Anthea\r\ncould not help wondering what would happen if Robert should have\r\nwandered off or turned his proper size during the interval. But she knew\r\nthat the Psammead's gifts really did last till sunset, however\r\ninconvenient their lasting might be; and she did not think, somehow,\r\nthat Robert would care to go out alone while he was that size.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the barn and Cyril called \"Robert!\" there was a stir\r\namong the loose hay, and Robert began to come out. His hand and arm came\r\nfirst--then a foot and leg. When the woman saw the hand she said \"My!\"\r\nbut when she saw the foot she said \"Upon my word!\" and when, by slow and\r\nheavy degrees, the whole of Robert's enormous bulk was at last\r\ndisclosed, she drew a long breath and began to say many things, compared\r\nwith which \"balmy\" and \"crumpet\" seemed quite ordinary. She dropped into\r\nunderstandable English at last.\r\n\r\n\"What'll you take for him?\" she said excitedly. \"Anything in reason.\r\nWe'd have a special van built--leastways, I know where there's a\r\nsecond-hand one would do up handsome--what a baby elephant had, as died.\r\nWhat'll you take? He's soft, ain't he? Them giants mostly is--but I\r\nnever see--no, never! What'll you take? Down on the nail. We'll treat\r\nhim like a king, and give him first-rate grub and a doss fit for a\r\nbloomin' dook. He must be dotty or he wouldn't need you kids to cart him\r\nabout. What'll you take for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't take anything,\" said Robert sternly. \"I'm no more soft than\r\nyou are--not so much, I shouldn't wonder. I'll come and be a show for\r\nto-day if you'll give me,\"--he hesitated at the enormous price he was\r\nabout to ask,--\"if you'll give me fifteen shillings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done,\" said the woman, so quickly that Robert felt he had been unfair\r\nto himself, and wished he had asked thirty. \"Come on now--and see my\r\nBill--and we'll fix a price for the season. I dessay you might get as\r\nmuch as two pounds a week reg'lar. Come on--and make yourself as small\r\nas you can for gracious' sake!\"\r\n\r\nThis was not very small, and a crowd gathered quickly, so that it was at\r\nthe head of an enthusiastic procession that Robert entered the trampled\r\nmeadow where the Fair was held, and passed over the stubby yellow dusty\r\ngrass to the door of the biggest tent. He crept in, and the woman went\r\nto call her Bill. He was the big sleeping man, and he did not seem at\r\nall pleased at being awakened. Cyril, watching through a slit in the\r\ntent, saw him scowl and shake a heavy fist and a sleepy head. Then the\r\nwoman went on speaking very fast. Cyril heard \"Strewth,\" and \"biggest\r\ndraw you ever, so help me!\" and he began to share Robert's feeling that\r\nfifteen shillings was indeed far too little. Bill slouched up to the\r\ntent and entered. When he beheld the magnificent proportions of Robert\r\nhe said but little,--\"Strike me pink!\" were the only words the children\r\ncould afterwards remember,--but he produced fifteen shillings, mainly in\r\nsixpences and coppers, and handed it to Robert.\r\n\r\n\"We'll fix up about what you're to draw when the show's over to-night,\"\r\nhe said with hoarse heartiness. \"Lor' love a duck! you'll be that happy\r\nwith us you'll never want to leave us. Can you do a song now--or a bit\r\nof a breakdown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to-day,\" said Robert, rejecting the idea of trying to sing \"As once\r\nin May,\" a favourite of his mother's, and the only song he could think\r\nof at the moment.\r\n\r\n\"Get Levi and clear them bloomin' photos out. Clear the tent. Stick out\r\na curtain or suthink,\" the man went on. \"Lor', what a pity we ain't got\r\nno tights his size! But we'll have 'em before the week's out. Young man,\r\nyour fortune's made. It's a good thing you came to me, and not to some\r\nchaps as I could tell you on. I've known blokes as beat their giants,\r\nand starved 'em too; so I'll tell you straight, you're in luck this day\r\nif you never was afore. 'Cos I'm a lamb, I am--and I don't deceive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid of anyone beating me,\" said Robert, looking down on the\r\n\"lamb.\" Robert was crouched on his knees, because the tent was not big\r\nenough for him to stand upright in, but even in that position he could\r\nstill look down on most people. \"But I'm awfully hungry--I wish you'd\r\nget me something to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, 'Becca,\" said the hoarse Bill. \"Get him some grub--the best\r\nyou've got, mind!\" Another whisper followed, of which the children only\r\nheard, \"Down in black and white--first thing to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThen the woman went to get the food--it was only bread and cheese when\r\nit came, but it was delightful to the large and empty Robert; and the\r\nman went to post sentinels round the tent, to give the alarm if Robert\r\nshould attempt to escape with his fifteen shillings.\r\n\r\n\"As if we weren't honest,\" said Anthea indignantly when the meaning of\r\nthe sentinels dawned on her.\r\n\r\nThen began a very strange and wonderful afternoon.\r\n\r\nBill was a man who knew his business. In a very little while, the\r\nphotographic views, the spyglasses you look at them through so that they\r\nreally seem rather real, and the lights you see them by, were all packed\r\naway. A curtain--it was an old red-and-black carpet really--was run\r\nacross the tent. Robert was concealed behind, and Bill was standing on a\r\ntrestle-table outside the tent making a speech. It was rather a good\r\nspeech. It began by saying that the giant it was his privilege to\r\nintroduce to the public that day was the eldest son of the Emperor of\r\nSan Francisco, compelled through an unfortunate love affair with the\r\nDuchess of the Fiji Islands to leave his own country and take refuge in\r\nEngland--the land of liberty--where freedom was the right of every man,\r\nno matter how big he was. It ended by the announcement that the first\r\ntwenty who came to the tent door should see the giant for threepence\r\napiece. \"After that,\" said Bill, \"the price is riz, and I don't\r\nundertake to say what it won't be riz to. So now's yer time.\"\r\n\r\nA young man with his sweetheart on her afternoon out was the first to\r\ncome forward. For this occasion his was the princely attitude--no\r\nexpense spared--money no object. His girl wished to see the giant? Well,\r\nshe should see the giant, even though seeing the giant cost threepence\r\neach and the other entertainments were all penny ones.\r\n\r\nThe flap of the tent was raised--the couple entered. Next moment a wild\r\nshriek from the girl thrilled through all present. Bill slapped his leg.\r\n\"That's done the trick!\" he whispered to 'Becca. It was indeed a\r\nsplendid advertisement of the charms of Robert.\r\n\r\nWhen the young girl came out she was pale and trembling, and a crowd was\r\nround the tent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: When the girl came out she was pale and trembling]\r\n\r\n\"What was it like?\" asked a farm-hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!--horrid!--you wouldn't believe,\" she said. \"It's as big as a barn,\r\nand that fierce. It froze the blood in my bones. I wouldn't ha' missed\r\nseeing it for anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe fierceness was only caused by Robert's trying not to laugh. But the\r\ndesire to do that soon left him, and before sunset he was more inclined\r\nto cry than laugh, and more inclined to sleep than either. For, by ones\r\nand twos and threes, people kept coming in all the afternoon, and Robert\r\nhad to shake hands with those who wished it, and to allow himself to be\r\npunched and pulled and patted and thumped, so that people might make\r\nsure he was really real.\r\n\r\nThe other children sat on a bench and watched and waited, and were very\r\nbored indeed. It seemed to them that this was the hardest way of earning\r\nmoney that could have been invented. And only fifteen shillings! Bill\r\nhad taken four times that already, for the news of the giant had spread,\r\nand trades-people in carts, and gentlepeople in carriages, came from far\r\nand near. One gentleman with an eyeglass, and a very large yellow rose\r\nin his buttonhole, offered Robert, in an obliging whisper, ten pounds a\r\nweek to appear at the Crystal Palace. Robert had to say \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" he said regretfully. \"It's no use promising what you can't\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, poor fellow, bound for a term of years, I suppose! Well, here's my\r\ncard; when your time's up come to me.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"When your time's up come to me\"]\r\n\r\n\"I will--if I'm the same size then,\" said Robert truthfully.\r\n\r\n\"If you grow a bit, so much the better,\" said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Robert beckoned Cyril and said--\r\n\r\n\"Tell them I must and will have a rest. And I want my tea.\"\r\n\r\nTea was provided, and a paper hastily pinned on the tent. It said--\r\n\r\n            CLOSED FOR HALF AN HOUR\r\n          WHILE THE GIANT GETS HIS TEA\r\n\r\nThen there was a hurried council.\r\n\r\n\"How am I to get away?\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking about it all the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, walk out when the sun sets and you're your right size. They can't\r\ndo anything to us.\"\r\n\r\nRobert opened his eyes. \"Why, they'd nearly kill us,\" he said, \"when\r\nthey saw me get my right size. No, we must think of some other way. We\r\n_must_ be alone when the sun sets.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Cyril briskly, and he went to the door, outside which\r\nBill was smoking a clay pipe and talking in a low voice to 'Becca.\r\nCyril heard him say--\"Good as havin' a fortune left you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Cyril, \"you can let people come in again in a minute.\r\nHe's nearly finished tea. But he _must_ be left alone when the sun sets.\r\nHe's very queer at that time of day, and if he's worried I won't answer\r\nfor the consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--what comes over him?\" asked Bill.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; it's--it's sort of a _change_,\" said Cyril candidly. \"He\r\nisn't at all like himself--you'd hardly know him. He's very queer\r\nindeed. Someone'll get hurt if he's not alone about sunset.\" This was\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n\"He'll pull round for the evening, I s'pose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes--half an hour after sunset he'll be quite himself again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Best humour him,\" said the woman.\r\n\r\nAnd so, at what Cyril judged was about half an hour before sunset, the\r\ntent was again closed \"whilst the giant gets his supper.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd was very merry about the giant's meals and their coming so\r\nclose together.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he can pick a bit,\" Bill owned. \"You see he has to eat hearty,\r\nbeing the size he is.\"\r\n\r\nInside the tent the four children breathlessly arranged a plan of\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\"You go _now_,\" said Cyril to the girls, \"and get along home as fast as\r\nyou can. Oh, never mind the pony-cart; we'll get that to-morrow. Robert\r\nand I are dressed the same. We'll manage somehow, like Sydney Carton\r\ndid. Only, you girls _must_ get out, or it's all no go. We can run, but\r\nyou can't--whatever you may think. No, Jane, it's no good Robert going\r\nout and knocking people down. The police would follow him till he turned\r\nhis proper size, and then arrest him like a shot. Go you must! If you\r\ndon't, I'll never speak to you again. It was you got us into this mess\r\nreally, hanging round people's legs the way you did this morning. _Go_,\r\nI tell you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jane and Anthea went.\r\n\r\n\"We're going home,\" they said to Bill. \"We're leaving the giant with\r\nyou. Be kind to him.\" And that, as Anthea said afterwards, was very\r\ndeceitful, but what were they to do?\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone, Cyril went to Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"he wants some ears of corn--there's some in the\r\nnext field but one. I'll just run and get it. Oh, and he says can't you\r\nloop up the tent at the back a bit? He says he's stifling for a breath\r\nof air. I'll see no one peeps in at him. I'll cover him up, and he can\r\ntake a nap while I go for the corn. He _will_ have it--there's no\r\nholding him when he gets like this.\"\r\n\r\nThe giant was made comfortable with a heap of sacks and an old\r\ntarpaulin. The curtain was looped up, and the brothers were left alone.\r\nThey matured their plan in whispers. Outside, the merry-go-round blared\r\nout its comic tunes, screaming now and then to attract public notice.\r\n\r\nHalf a minute after the sun had set, a boy came out past Bill.\r\n\r\n\"I'm off for the corn,\" he said, and mingled quickly with the crowd.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant a boy came out of the back of the tent past 'Becca,\r\nposted there as sentinel.\r\n\r\n\"I'm off after the corn,\" said this boy also. And he, too, moved away\r\nquietly and was lost in the crowd. The front-door boy was Cyril; the\r\nback-door was Robert--now, since sunset, once more his proper size. They\r\nwalked quickly through the field, along the road, where Robert caught\r\nCyril up. Then they ran. They were home as soon as the girls were, for\r\nit was a long way, and they ran most of it. It was indeed a _very_ long\r\nway, as they found when they had to go and drag the pony-cart home next\r\nmorning, with no enormous Robert to wheel them in it as if it were a\r\nmail-cart, and they were babies and he was their gigantic nursemaid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot possibly tell you what Bill and 'Becca said when they found\r\nthat the giant had gone. For one thing, I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGROWN UP\r\n\r\n\r\nCyril had once pointed out that ordinary life is full of occasions on\r\nwhich a wish would be most useful. And this thought filled his mind when\r\nhe happened to wake early on the morning after the morning after Robert\r\nhad wished to be bigger than the baker's boy, and had been it. The day\r\nthat lay between these two days had been occupied entirely by getting\r\nthe governess-cart home from Benenhurst.\r\n\r\nCyril dressed hastily; he did not take a bath, because tin baths are so\r\nnoisy, and he had no wish to rouse Robert, and he slipped off alone, as\r\nAnthea had once done, and ran through the dewy morning to the sand-pit.\r\nHe dug up the Psammead very carefully and kindly, and began the\r\nconversation by asking it whether it still felt any ill effects from\r\nthe contact with the tears of Robert the day before yesterday. The\r\nPsammead was in good temper. It replied politely.\r\n\r\n\"And now, what can I do for you?\" it said. \"I suppose you've come here\r\nso early to ask for something for yourself--something your brothers and\r\nsisters aren't to know about, eh? Now, do be persuaded for your own\r\ngood! Ask for a good fat Megatherium and have done with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you--not to-day, I think,\" said Cyril cautiously. \"What I really\r\nwanted to say was--you know how you're always wishing for things when\r\nyou're playing at anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I seldom play,\" said the Psammead coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know what I mean,\" Cyril went on impatiently. \"What I want to\r\nsay is: won't you let us have our wish just when we think of it, and\r\njust where we happen to be? So that we don't have to come and disturb\r\nyou again,\" added the crafty Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"It'll only end in your wishing for something you don't really want, as\r\nyou did about the castle,\" said the Psammead, stretching its brown arms\r\nand yawning. \"It's always the same since people left off eating really\r\nwholesome things. However, have it your own way. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" said Cyril politely.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said the Psammead suddenly, shooting out its long\r\nsnail's eyes,--\"I'm getting tired of you--all of you. You have no more\r\nsense than so many oysters. Go along with you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Cyril went.\r\n\r\n\"What an awful long time babies _stay_ babies,\" said Cyril after the\r\nLamb had taken his watch out of his pocket while he wasn't noticing, and\r\nwith coos and clucks of naughty rapture had opened the case and used the\r\nwhole thing as a garden spade, and when even immersion in a wash basin\r\nhad failed to wash the mould from the works and make the watch go again.\r\nCyril had said several things in the heat of the moment; but now he was\r\ncalmer, and had even consented to carry the Lamb part of the way to\r\nthe woods. Cyril had persuaded the others to agree to his plan, and not\r\nto wish for anything more till they really did wish it. Meantime it\r\nseemed good to go to the woods for nuts, and on the mossy grass under a\r\nsweet chestnut tree the five were sitting. The Lamb was pulling up the\r\nmoss by fat handfuls, and Cyril was gloomily contemplating the ruins of\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He opened the case and used the whole thing as a garden\r\nspade]\r\n\r\n\"He does grow,\" said Anthea. \"Doesn't 'oo, precious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me grow,\" said the Lamb cheerfully--\"me grow big boy, have guns' an'\r\nmouses--an'--an'\"---- Imagination or vocabulary gave out here. But\r\nanyway it was the longest speech the Lamb had ever made, and it charmed\r\neveryone, even Cyril, who tumbled the Lamb over and rolled him in the\r\nmoss to the music of delighted squeals.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he'll be grown up some day,\" Anthea was saying, dreamily\r\nlooking up at the blue of the sky that showed between the long straight\r\nchestnut-leaves. But at that moment the Lamb, struggling gaily with\r\nCyril, thrust a stout-shod little foot against his brother's chest;\r\nthere was a crack!--the innocent Lamb had broken the glass of father's\r\nsecond-best Waterbury watch, which Cyril had borrowed without leave.\r\n\r\n\"Grow up some day!\" said Cyril bitterly, plumping the Lamb down on the\r\ngrass. \"I daresay he will--when nobody wants him to. I wish to goodness\r\nhe would\"--\r\n\r\n\"_Oh_, take care!\" cried Anthea in an agony of apprehension. But it was\r\ntoo late--like music to a song her words and Cyril's came out together--\r\n\r\nAnthea--\"Oh, take care!\"\r\n\r\nCyril--\"Grow up now!\"\r\n\r\nThe faithful Psammead was true to its promise, and there, before the\r\nhorrified eyes of its brothers and sisters, the Lamb suddenly and\r\nviolently grew up. It was the most terrible moment. The change was not\r\nso sudden as the wish-changes usually were. The Baby's face changed\r\nfirst. It grew thinner and larger, lines came in the forehead, the eyes\r\ngrew more deep-set and darker in colour, the mouth grew longer and\r\nthinner; most terrible of all, a little dark mustache appeared on the\r\nlip of one who was still--except as to the face--a two-year-old baby in\r\na linen smock and white open-work socks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wish it wouldn't! Oh, I wish it wouldn't! You boys might wish as\r\nwell!\"\r\n\r\nThey all wished hard, for the sight was enough to dismay the most\r\nheartless. They all wished so hard, indeed, that they felt quite giddy\r\nand almost lost consciousness; but the wishing was quite vain, for, when\r\nthe wood ceased to whirl round, their dazed eyes were riveted at once by\r\nthe spectacle of a very proper-looking young man in flannels and a straw\r\nhat--a young man who wore the same little black mustache which just\r\nbefore they had actually seen growing upon the Baby's lip. This, then,\r\nwas the Lamb--grown up! Their own Lamb! It was a terrible moment. The\r\ngrown-up Lamb moved gracefully across the moss and settled himself\r\nagainst the trunk of the sweet chestnut. He tilted the straw hat over\r\nhis eyes. He was evidently weary. He was going to sleep. The Lamb--the\r\noriginal little tiresome beloved Lamb often went to sleep at odd times\r\nand in unexpected places. Was this new Lamb in the grey flannel suit and\r\nthe pale green necktie like the other Lamb? or had his mind grown up\r\ntogether with his body?\r\n\r\nThat was the question which the others, in a hurried council held among\r\nthe yellowing brake-fern a few yards from the sleeper, debated eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Whichever it is, it'll be just as awful,\" said Anthea. \"If his inside\r\nsenses are grown up too, he won't stand our looking after him; and if\r\nhe's still a baby inside of him how on earth are we to get him to do\r\nanything? And it'll be getting on for dinner-time in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we haven't got any nuts,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh bother nuts!\" said Robert, \"but dinner's different--I didn't have\r\nhalf enough dinner yesterday. Couldn't we tie him to the tree and go\r\nhome to our dinner and come back afterwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fat lot of dinner we should get if we went back without the Lamb!\"\r\nsaid Cyril in scornful misery. \"And it'll be just the same if we go back\r\nwith him in the state he is now. Yes, I know it's my doing; don't rub it\r\nin! I know I'm a beast, and not fit to live; you can take that for\r\nsettled, and say no more about it. The question is, what are we going to\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's wake him up, and take him into Rochester or Maidstone and get\r\nsomething to eat at a baker's shop,\" said Robert hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"Take him?\" repeated Cyril. \"Yes--do! It's all my fault--I don't deny\r\nthat--but you'll find you've got your work cut out for you if you try to\r\ntake that young man anywhere. The Lamb always was spoilt, but now he's\r\ngrown up he's a demon--simply. I can see it. Look at his mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Robert, \"let's wake him up and see what _he'll_ do.\r\nPerhaps _he'll_ take _us_ to Maidstone and stand treat. He ought to have\r\na lot of money in the pockets of those extra-special pants. We _must_\r\nhave dinner, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThey drew lots with little bits of brake fern. It fell to Jane's lot to\r\nwaken the grown-up Lamb.\r\n\r\nShe did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of honeysuckle. He\r\nsaid \"Bother the flies!\" twice, and then opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She did it gently by tickling his nose with a twig of\r\nhoneysuckle]\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, kiddies!\" he said in a languid tone, \"still here? What's the\r\ngiddy hour? You'll be late for your grub!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know we shall,\" said Robert bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Then cut along home,\" said the grown-up Lamb.\r\n\r\n\"What about your grub, though?\" asked Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how far is it to the station, do you think? I've a sort of a notion\r\nthat I'll run up to town and have some lunch at the club.\"\r\n\r\nBlank misery fell like a pall on the four others. The\r\nLamb--alone--unattended--would go to town and have lunch at a club!\r\nPerhaps he would also have tea there. Perhaps sunset would come upon him\r\namid the dazzling luxury of club-land, and a helpless cross sleepy\r\nbaby would find itself alone amid unsympathetic waiters, and would wail\r\nmiserably for \"Panty\" from the depths of a club arm-chair! The picture\r\nmoved Anthea almost to tears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, Lamb ducky, you mustn't do that!\" she cried incautiously.\r\n\r\nThe grown-up Lamb frowned. \"My dear Anthea,\" he said, \"how often am I to\r\ntell you that my name is Hilary or St. Maur or Devereux?--any of my\r\nbaptismal names are free to my little brothers and sisters, but _not_\r\n'Lamb'--a relic of foolishness and far-off childhood.\"\r\n\r\nThis was awful. He was their elder brother now, was he? Well of course\r\nhe was, if he was grown-up--since they weren't. Thus, in whispers,\r\nAnthea and Robert.\r\n\r\nBut the almost daily adventures resulting from the Psammead's wishes\r\nwere making the children wise beyond their years.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Hilary,\" said Anthea, and the others choked at the name, \"you know\r\nfather didn't wish you to go to London. He wouldn't like us to be left\r\nalone without you to take care of us. Oh, deceitful thing that I am!\"\r\nshe added to herself.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Cyril, \"if you're our elder brother, why not behave as\r\nsich and take us over to Maidstone and give us a jolly good blow-out,\r\nand we'll go on the river afterwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm infinitely obliged to you,\" said the Lamb courteously, \"but I\r\nshould prefer solitude. Go home to your lunch--I mean your dinner.\r\nPerhaps I may look in about tea-time--or I may not be home till after\r\nyou are in your beds.\"\r\n\r\nTheir beds! Speaking glances flashed between the wretched four. Much bed\r\nthere would be for them if they went home without the Lamb.\r\n\r\n\"We promised mother not to lose sight of you if we took you out,\" Jane\r\nsaid before the others could stop her.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Jane,\" said the grown-up Lamb, putting his hands in his\r\npockets and looking down at her, \"little girls should be seen and not\r\nheard. You kids must learn not to make yourselves a nuisance. Run along\r\nhome now--and perhaps, if you're good, I'll give you each a penny\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Cyril, in the best \"man to man\" tone at his command,\r\n\"where are you going, old man? You might let Bobs and me come with\r\nyou--even if you don't want the girls.\"\r\n\r\nThis was really rather noble of Cyril, for he never did care much about\r\nbeing seen in public with the Lamb, who of course after sunset would be\r\na baby again.\r\n\r\nThe \"man to man\" tone succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"I shall run over to Maidstone on my bike,\" said the new Lamb airily,\r\nfingering the little black mustache. \"I can lunch at The Crown--and\r\nperhaps I'll have a pull on the river; but I can't take you all on the\r\nmachine--now, can I? Run along home, like good children.\"\r\n\r\nThe position was desperate. Robert exchanged a despairing look with\r\nCyril. Anthea detached a pin from her waistband, a pin whose withdrawal\r\nleft a gaping chasm between skirt and bodice, and handed it furtively to\r\nRobert--with a grimace of the darkest and deepest meaning. Robert\r\nslipped away to the road. There, sure enough, stood a bicycle--a\r\nbeautiful new one. Of course Robert understood at once that if the Lamb\r\nwas grown up he _must_ have a bicycle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There, sure enough, stood a bicycle]\r\n\r\nThis had always been one of Robert's own reasons for wishing to be\r\ngrown-up. He hastily began to use the pin--eleven punctures in the back\r\ntyre, seven in the front. He would have made the total twenty-two but\r\nfor the rustling of the yellow hazel-leaves, which warned him of the\r\napproach of the others. He hastily leaned a hand on each wheel, and was\r\nrewarded by the \"whish\" of the what was left of air escaping from\r\neighteen neat pin-holes.\r\n\r\n\"Your bike's run down,\" said Robert, wondering how he could so soon have\r\nlearned to deceive.\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"It's a puncture,\" said Anthea, stooping down, and standing up again\r\nwith a thorn which she had got ready for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Look here.\"\r\n\r\nThe grown-up Lamb (or Hilary, as I suppose one must now call him) fixed\r\nhis pump and blew up the tyre. The punctured state of it was soon\r\nevident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The punctured state of it was soon evident]\r\n\r\n\"I suppose there's a cottage somewhere near--where one could get a pail\r\nof water?\" said the Lamb.\r\n\r\nThere was; and when the number of punctures had been made manifest, it\r\nwas felt to be a special blessing that the cottage provided \"teas for\r\ncyclists.\" It provided an odd sort of tea-and-hammy meal for the Lamb\r\nand his brothers. This was paid for out of the fifteen shillings which\r\nhad been earned by Robert when he was a giant--for the Lamb, it\r\nappeared, had unfortunately no money about him. This was a great\r\ndisappointment for the others; but it is a thing that will happen, even\r\nto the most grown-up of us. However, Robert had enough to eat, and that\r\nwas something. Quietly but persistently the miserable four took it in\r\nturns to try and persuade the Lamb (or St. Maur) to spend the rest of\r\nthe day in the woods. There was not very much of the day left by the\r\ntime he had mended the eighteenth puncture. He looked up from the\r\ncompleted work with a sigh of relief, and suddenly put his tie straight.\r\n\r\n\"There's a lady coming,\" he said briskly,--\"for goodness' sake, get out\r\nof the way. Go home--hide--vanish somehow! I can't be seen with a pack\r\nof dirty kids.\" His brothers and sisters were indeed rather dirty,\r\nbecause, earlier in the day, the Lamb, in his infant state, had\r\nsprinkled a good deal of garden soil over them. The grown-up Lamb's\r\nvoice was so tyrant-like, as Jane said afterwards, that they actually\r\nretreated to the back garden, and left him with his little mustache and\r\nhis flannel suit to meet alone the young lady, who now came up the front\r\ngarden wheeling a bicycle.\r\n\r\nThe woman of the house came out, and the young lady spoke to her,--the\r\nLamb raised his hat as she passed him,--and the children could not hear\r\nwhat she said, though they were craning round the corner and listening\r\nwith all their ears. They felt it to be \"perfectly fair,\" as Robert\r\nsaid, \"with that wretched Lamb in that condition.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Lamb spoke, in a languid voice heavy with politeness, they\r\nheard well enough.\r\n\r\n\"A puncture?\" he was saying. \"Can I not be of any assistance? If you\r\ncould allow me----?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stifled explosion of laughter and the grown-up Lamb\r\n(otherwise Devereux) turned the tail of an angry eye in its direction.\r\n\r\n\"You're very kind,\" said the lady, looking at the Lamb. She looked\r\nrather shy, but, as the boys put it, there didn't seem to be any\r\nnonsense about her.\r\n\r\n\"But oh,\" whispered Cyril, \"I should have thought he'd had enough\r\nbicycle-mending for one day--and if she only knew that really and truly\r\nhe's only a whiny-piny, silly little baby!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's _not_,\" Anthea murmured angrily. \"He's a dear--if people only let\r\nhim alone. It's our own precious Lamb still, whatever silly idiots may\r\nturn him into--isn't he, Pussy?\"\r\n\r\nJane doubtfully supposed so.\r\n\r\nNow, the Lamb--whom I must try to remember to call St. Maur--was\r\nexamining the lady's bicycle and talking to her with a very grown-up\r\nmanner indeed. No one could possibly have supposed, to see and hear him,\r\nthat only that very morning he had been a chubby child of two years\r\nbreaking other people's Waterbury watches. Devereux (as he ought to be\r\ncalled for the future) took out a gold watch when he had mended the\r\nlady's bicycle, and all the hidden onlookers said \"Oh!\"--because it\r\nseemed so unfair that the Baby, who had only that morning destroyed two\r\ncheap but honest watches, should now, in the grown-upness to which\r\nCyril's folly had raised him, have a real gold watch--with a chain and\r\nseals!\r\n\r\nHilary (as I will now term him) withered his brothers and sisters with a\r\nglance, and then said to the lady--with whom he seemed to be quite\r\nfriendly--\r\n\r\n\"If you will allow me, I will ride with you as far as the Cross Roads;\r\nit is getting late, and there are tramps about.\"\r\n\r\nNo one will ever know what answer the young lady intended to give to\r\nthis gallant offer, for, directly Anthea heard it made, she rushed out,\r\nknocking against a swill pail, which overflowed in a turbid stream, and\r\ncaught the Lamb (I suppose I ought to say Hilary) by the arm. The others\r\nfollowed, and in an instant the four dirty children were visible beyond\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let him,\" said Anthea to the lady, and she spoke with intense\r\nearnestness; \"he's not fit to go with anyone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go away, little girl!\" said St. Maur (as we will now call him) in a\r\nterrible voice.\r\n\r\n\"Go home at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd much better not have anything to do with him,\" the now reckless\r\nAnthea went on. \"He doesn't know who he is. He's something very\r\ndifferent from what you think he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the lady, not unnaturally, while Devereux (as\r\nI must term the grown-up Lamb) tried vainly to push Anthea away. The\r\nothers backed her up, and she stood solid as a rock.\r\n\r\n\"You just let him go with you,\" said Anthea, \"you'll soon see what I\r\nmean! How would you like to suddenly see a poor little helpless baby\r\nspinning along downhill beside you with its feet up on a bicycle it had\r\nlost control of?\"\r\n\r\nThe lady had turned rather pale.\r\n\r\n\"Who are these very dirty children?\" she asked the grown-up Lamb\r\n(sometimes called St. Maur in these pages).\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he lied miserably.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lamb! how _can_ you?\" cried Jane,--\"when you know perfectly well\r\nyou're our own little baby brother that we're so fond of. We're his big\r\nbrothers and sisters,\" she explained, turning to the lady, who with\r\ntrembling hands was now turning her bicycle towards the gate, \"and we've\r\ngot to take care of him. And we must get him home before sunset, or I\r\ndon't know whatever will become of us. You see, he's sort of under a\r\nspell--enchanted--you know what I mean!\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again the Lamb (Devereux, I mean) had tried to stop Jane's\r\neloquence, but Robert and Cyril held him, one by each leg, and no proper\r\nexplanation was possible. The lady rode hastily away, and electrified\r\nher relatives at dinner by telling them of her escape from a family of\r\ndangerous lunatics. \"The little girl's eyes were simply those of a\r\nmaniac. I can't think how she came to be at large,\" she said.\r\n\r\nWhen her bicycle had whizzed away down the road, Cyril spoke gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Hilary, old chap,\" he said, \"you must have had a sunstroke or\r\nsomething. And the things you've been saying to that lady! Why, if we\r\nwere to tell you the things you've said when you are yourself again,\r\nsay to-morrow morning, you wouldn't ever understand them--let alone\r\nbelieve them! You trust to me, old chap, and come home now, and if\r\nyou're not yourself in the morning we'll ask the milkman to ask the\r\ndoctor to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor grown-up Lamb (St. Maur was really one of his Christian names)\r\nseemed now too bewildered to resist.\r\n\r\n\"Since you seem all to be as mad as the whole worshipful company of\r\nhatters,\" he said bitterly, \"I suppose I _had_ better take you home. But\r\nyou're not to suppose I shall pass this over. I shall have something to\r\nsay to you all to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you will, my Lamb,\" said Anthea under her breath, \"but it won't be\r\nat all the sort of thing you think it's going to be.\"\r\n\r\nIn her heart she could hear the pretty, soft little loving voice of the\r\nbaby Lamb--so different from the affected tones of the dreadful grown-up\r\nLamb (one of whose names was Devereux)--saying, \"Me love Panty--wants to\r\ncome to own Panty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let's go home, for goodness' sake,\" she said. \"You shall say\r\nwhatever you like in the morning--if you can,\" she added in a whisper.\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy party that went home through the soft evening. During\r\nAnthea's remarks Robert had again made play with the pin and the bicycle\r\ntyre, and the Lamb (whom they had to call St. Maur or Devereux or\r\nHilary) seemed really at last to have had his fill of bicycle-mending.\r\nSo the machine was wheeled.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just on the point of setting when they arrived at the White\r\nHouse. The four elder children would have liked to linger in the lane\r\ntill the complete sunsetting turned the grown-up Lamb (whose Christian\r\nnames I will not further weary you by repeating) into their own dear\r\ntiresome baby brother. But he, in his grown-upness, insisted on going\r\non, and thus he was met in the front garden by Martha.\r\n\r\nNow you remember that, as a special favour, the Psammead had arranged\r\nthat the servants in the house should never notice any change brought\r\nabout by the wishes of the children. Therefore Martha merely saw the\r\nusual party, with the baby Lamb, about whom she had been desperately\r\nanxious all the afternoon, trotting beside Anthea, on fat baby legs,\r\nwhile the children, of course, still saw the grown-up Lamb (never mind\r\nwhat names he was christened by), and Martha rushed at him and caught\r\nhim in her arms, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"Come to his own Martha, then--a precious poppet!\"\r\n\r\nThe grown-up Lamb (whose names shall now be buried in oblivion)\r\nstruggled furiously. An expression of intense horror and annoyance was\r\nseen on his face. But Martha was stronger than he. She lifted him up and\r\ncarried him into the house. None of the children will ever forget that\r\npicture. The neat grey-flannel-suited grown-up young man with the green\r\nnecktie and the little black mustache--fortunately, he was slightly\r\nbuilt, and not tall--struggling in the sturdy arms of Martha, who\r\nbore him away helpless, imploring him, as she went, to be a good boy\r\nnow, and come and have his nice bremmink! Fortunately, the sun set as\r\nthey reached the doorstep, the bicycle disappeared, and Martha was seen\r\nto carry into the house the real live darling sleepy two-year-old Lamb.\r\nThe grown-up Lamb (nameless henceforth) was gone for ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The grown-up Lamb struggled]\r\n\r\n\"For ever,\" said Cyril, \"because, as soon as ever the Lamb's old enough\r\nto be bullied, we must jolly well begin to bully him, for his own\r\nsake--so that he mayn't grow up like _that_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shan't bully him,\" said Anthea stoutly,--\"not if I can stop it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must tame him by kindness,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Robert, \"if he grows up in the usual way, there'll be\r\nplenty of time to correct him as he goes along. The awful thing to-day\r\nwas his growing up so suddenly. There was no time to improve him at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't want any improving,\" said Anthea as the voice of the Lamb\r\ncame cooing through the open door, just as she had heard it in her heart\r\nthat afternoon--\r\n\r\n\"Me loves Panty--wants to come to own Panty!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSCALPS\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the day would have been a greater success if Cyril had not been\r\nreading _The Last of the Mohicans_. The story was running in his head at\r\nbreakfast, and as he took his third cup of tea he said dreamily, \"I wish\r\nthere were Red Indians in England--not big ones, you know, but little\r\nones, just about the right size for us to fight.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone disagreed with him at the time and no one attached any\r\nimportance to the incident. But when they went down to the sand-pit to\r\nask for a hundred pounds in two-shilling pieces with Queen Victoria's\r\nhead on, to prevent mistakes--which they had always felt to be a really\r\nreasonable wish that must turn out well--they found out that they had\r\ndone it again! For the Psammead, which was very cross and sleepy,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't bother me. You've had your wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know it,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember yesterday?\" said the Sand-fairy, still more\r\ndisagreeably. \"You asked me to let you have your wishes wherever you\r\nhappened to be, and you wished this morning, and you've got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, have we?\" said Robert. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"So you've forgotten?\" said the Psammead, beginning to burrow. \"Never\r\nmind; you'll know soon enough. And I wish you joy of it! A nice thing\r\nyou've let yourselves in for!\"\r\n\r\n\"We always do somehow,\" said Jane sadly.\r\n\r\nAnd now the odd thing was that no one could remember anyone's having\r\nwished for anything that morning. The wish about the Red Indians had not\r\nstuck in anyone's head. It was a most anxious morning. Everyone was\r\ntrying to remember what had been wished for, and no one could, and\r\neveryone kept expecting something awful to happen every minute. It was\r\nmost agitating; they knew from what the Psammead had said, that they\r\nmust have wished for something more than usually undesirable, and they\r\nspent several hours in most agonizing uncertainty. It was not till\r\nnearly dinner-time that Jane tumbled over _The Last of the\r\nMohicans_,--which had of course, been left face downwards on the\r\nfloor,--and when Anthea had picked her and the book up she suddenly\r\nsaid, \"I know!\" and sat down flat on the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Pussy, how awful! It was Indians he wished for--Cyril--at\r\nbreakfast, don't you remember? He said, 'I wish there were Red Indians\r\nin England,'--and now there are, and they're going about scalping people\r\nall over the country, as likely as not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they're only in Northumberland and Durham,\" said Jane\r\nsoothingly. It was almost impossible to believe that it could really\r\nhurt people much to be scalped so far away as that.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you believe it!\" said Anthea. \"The Sammyadd said we'd let\r\nourselves in for a nice thing. That means they'll come _here_. And\r\nsuppose they scalped the Lamb!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the scalping would come right again at sunset,\" said Jane; but\r\nshe did not speak so hopefully as usual.\r\n\r\n\"Not it!\" said Anthea. \"The things that grow out of the wishes don't go.\r\nLook at the fifteen shillings! Pussy, I'm going to break something, and\r\nyou must let me have every penny of money you've got. The Indians will\r\ncome _here_, don't you see? That Spiteful Psammead as good as said so.\r\nYou see what my plan is? Come on!\"\r\n\r\nJane did not see at all. But she followed her sister meekly into\r\nmother's bedroom.\r\n\r\nAnthea lifted down the heavy water-jug--it had a pattern of storks and\r\nlong grasses on it, which Anthea never forgot. She carried it into the\r\ndressing-room, and carefully emptied the water out of it into the bath.\r\nThen she took the jug back into the bedroom and dropped it on the floor.\r\nYou know how a jug always breaks if you happen to drop it by accident.\r\nIf you happen to drop it on purpose, it is quite different. Anthea\r\ndropped that jug three times, and it was as unbroken as ever. So at last\r\nshe had to take her father's boot-tree and break the jug with that in\r\ncold blood. It was heartless work.\r\n\r\nNext she broke open the missionary-box with the poker. Jane told her\r\nthat it was wrong, of course, but Anthea shut her lips very tight and\r\nthen said--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She broke open the missionary-box with the poker.]\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly--it's a matter of life and death.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not very much in the missionary-box,--only\r\nseven-and-fourpence,--but the girls between them had nearly four\r\nshillings. This made over eleven shillings, as you will easily see.\r\n\r\nAnthea tied up the money in a corner of her pocket-handkerchief. \"Come\r\non, Jane!\" she said, and ran down to the farm. She knew that the farmer\r\nwas going into Rochester that afternoon. In fact it had been arranged\r\nthat he was to take the four children with him. They had planned this in\r\nthe happy hour when they believed that they we're going to get that\r\nhundred pounds, in two-shilling pieces, out of the Psammead. They had\r\narranged to pay the farmer two shillings each for the ride. Now Anthea\r\nhastily explained to him that they could not go, but would he take\r\nMartha and the Baby instead? He agreed, but he was not pleased to get\r\nonly half-a-crown instead of eight shillings.\r\n\r\nThen the girls ran home again. Anthea was agitated, but not flurried.\r\nWhen she came to think it over afterwards, she could not help seeing\r\nthat she had acted with the most far-seeing promptitude, just like a\r\nborn general. She fetched a little box from her corner drawer, and went\r\nto find Martha, who was laying the cloth and not in the best of tempers.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Anthea. \"I've broken the water jug in mother's room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like you--always up to some mischief,\" said Martha, dumping down a\r\nsalt-cellar with a bang.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be cross, Martha dear,\" said Anthea. \"I've got enough money to\r\npay for a new one--if only you'll be a dear and go and buy it for us.\r\nYour cousins keep a china-shop, don't they? And I would like you to get\r\nit to-day, in case mother comes home to-morrow. You know she said she\r\nmight perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're all going into town yourselves,\" said Martha.\r\n\r\n\"We can't afford to, if we get the new jug,\" said Anthea; \"but we'll pay\r\nfor you to go, if you'll take the Lamb. And I say, Martha, look\r\nhere--I'll give you my Liberty box, if you'll go. Look, it's most\r\nawfully pretty--all inlaid with real silver and ivory and ebony, like\r\nKing Solomon's temple.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Martha,--\"no, I don't want your box, miss. What you want\r\nis to get the precious Lamb off your hands for the afternoon. Don't you\r\ngo for to think I don't see through you!\"\r\n\r\nThis was so true that Anthea longed to deny it at once. Martha had no\r\nbusiness to know so much. But she held her tongue.\r\n\r\nMartha set down the bread with a bang that made it jump off its\r\ntrencher.\r\n\r\n\"I _do_ want the jug got,\" said Anthea softly. \"You _will_ go, won't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, just for this once, I don't mind; but mind you don't get into\r\nnone of your outrageous mischief while I'm gone--that's all!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's going earlier than he thought,\" said Anthea eagerly. \"You'd better\r\nhurry and get dressed. Do put on that lovely purple frock, Martha, and\r\nthe hat with the pink cornflowers, and the yellow-lace collar. Jane'll\r\nfinish laying the cloth, and I'll wash the Lamb and get him ready.\"\r\n\r\nAs she washed the unwilling Lamb and hurried him into his best clothes,\r\nAnthea peeped out of the window from time to time; so far all was\r\nwell--she could see no Red Indians. When with a rush and a scurry and\r\nsome deepening of the damask of Martha's complexion she and the Lamb had\r\nbeen got off, Anthea drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"_He's_ safe!\" she said, and, to Jane's horror, flung herself down on\r\nthe floor and burst into floods of tears. Jane did not understand at all\r\nhow a person could be so brave and like a general, and then suddenly\r\ngive way and go flat like an air-balloon when you prick it. It is better\r\nnot to go flat, of course, but you will observe that Anthea did not give\r\nway till her aim was accomplished. She had got the dear Lamb out of\r\ndanger--she felt certain that the Red Indians would be round the White\r\nHouse or nowhere--the farmer's cart would not come back till after\r\nsunset, so she could afford to cry a little. It was partly with joy that\r\nshe cried, because she had done what she meant to do. She cried for\r\nabout three minutes, while Jane hugged her miserably and said at\r\nfive-second intervals, \"Don't cry, Panther dear!\"\r\n\r\nThen she jumped up, rubbed her eyes hard with the corner of her\r\npinafore, so that they kept red for the rest of the day, and started to\r\ntell the boys. But just at that moment cook rang the dinner-bell, and\r\nnothing could be said till they had been helped to minced beef. Then\r\ncook left the room, and Anthea told her tale. But it is a mistake to\r\ntell a thrilling tale when people are eating minced beef and boiled\r\npotatoes. There seemed somehow to be something about the food that made\r\nthe idea of Red Indians seem flat and unbelievable. The boys actually\r\nlaughed, and called Anthea a little silly.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Cyril, \"I'm almost sure it was before I said that, that Jane\r\nsaid she wished it would be a fine day.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't,\" said Jane briefly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, if it was Indians,\" Cyril went on,--\"salt, please, and mustard--I\r\nmust have something to make this mush go down,--if it was Indians,\r\nthey'd have been infesting the place long before this--you know they\r\nwould. I believe it's the fine day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did the Sammyadd say we'd let ourselves in for a nice thing?\"\r\nasked Anthea. She was feeling very cross. She knew she had acted with\r\nnobility and discretion, and after that it was very hard to be called a\r\nlittle silly, especially when she had the weight of a burglared\r\nmissionary-box and about seven-and-fourpence, mostly in coppers, lying\r\nlike lead upon her conscience.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, during which cook took away the mincy plates and\r\nbrought in the pudding. As soon as she had retired, Cyril began again.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I don't mean to say,\" he admitted, \"that it wasn't a good\r\nthing to get Martha and the Lamb out of the way for the afternoon; but\r\nas for Red Indians--why, you know jolly well the wishes always come that\r\nvery minute. If there was going to be Red Indians, they'd be here now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect they are,\" said Anthea; \"they're lurking amid the undergrowth,\r\nfor anything you know. I do think you're most unkind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indians almost always _do_ lurk, really, though, don't they?\" put in\r\nJane, anxious for peace.\r\n\r\n\"No, they don't,\" said Cyril tartly. \"And I'm not unkind, I'm only\r\ntruthful. And I say it was utter rot breaking the water-jug; and as for\r\nthe missionary-box, I believe it's a treason-crime, and I shouldn't\r\nwonder if you could be hanged for it, if any of us was to split\"--\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, can't you?\" said Robert; but Cyril couldn't. You see, he felt\r\nin his heart that if there _should_ be Indians they would be entirely\r\nhis own fault, so he did not wish to believe in them. And trying not to\r\nbelieve things when in your heart you are almost sure they are true, is\r\nas bad for the temper as anything I know.\r\n\r\n\"It's simply idiotic,\" he said, \"talking about Indians, when you can see\r\nfor yourself that it's Jane who's got her wish. Look what a fine day it\r\nis----_OH!_--\"\r\n\r\nHe had turned towards the window to point out the fineness of the\r\nday--the others turned too--and a frozen silence caught at Cyril, and\r\nnone of the others felt at all like breaking it. For there, peering\r\nround the corner of the window, among the red leaves of the Virginia\r\ncreeper, was a face--a brown face, with a long nose and a tight mouth\r\nand very bright eyes. And the face was painted in coloured patches. It\r\nhad long black hair, and in the hair were feathers!\r\n\r\nEvery child's mouth in the room opened, and stayed open. The pudding was\r\ngrowing white and cold on their plates. No one could move.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the feathered head was cautiously withdrawn, and the spell was\r\nbroken. I am sorry to say that Anthea's first words were very like a\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"There, now!\" she said. \"I told you so!\"\r\n\r\nThe pudding had now definitely ceased to charm. Hastily wrapping their\r\nportions in a _Spectator_ of the week before the week before last, they\r\nhid them behind the crinkled paper stove-ornament, and fled upstairs to\r\nreconnoitre and to hold a hurried council.\r\n\r\n\"Pax,\" said Cyril handsomely when they reached their mother's bedroom.\r\n\"Panther, I'm sorry if I was a brute.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Anthea; \"but you see now!\"\r\n\r\nNo further trace of Indians, however, could be discerned from the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Robert, \"what are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only thing I can think of,\" said Anthea, who was now generally\r\nadmitted to be the heroine of the day, \"is--if we dressed up as like\r\nIndians as we can, and looked out of the windows, or even went out. They\r\nmight think we were the powerful leaders of a large neighbouring tribe,\r\nand--and not do anything to us, you know, for fear of awful vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Eliza, and the cook?\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"You forget--they can't notice anything,\" said Robert. \"They wouldn't\r\nnotice anything out of the way, even if they were scalped or roasted at\r\na slow fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would they come right at sunset?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. You can't be really scalped or burned to death without\r\nnoticing it, and you'd be sure to notice it next day, even if it escaped\r\nyour attention at the time,\" said Cyril. \"I think Anthea's right, but we\r\nshall want a most awful lot of feathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go down to the hen-house,\" said Robert. \"There's one of the\r\nturkeys in there--it's not very well. I could cut its feathers without\r\nit minding much. It's very bad--doesn't seem to care what happens to it.\r\nGet me the cutting-out scissors.\"\r\n\r\nEarnest reconnoitring convinced them all that no Indians were in the\r\npoultry-yard. Robert went. In five minutes he came back--pale, but with\r\nmany feathers.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"this is jolly serious. I cut off the feathers,\r\nand when I turned to come out there was an Indian squinting at me from\r\nunder the old hen-coop. I just brandished the feathers and yelled, and\r\ngot away before he could get the coop off top of himself. Panther, get\r\nthe coloured blankets off our beds, and look slippy, can't you?\"\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how like an Indian you can make yourself with blankets\r\nand feathers and coloured scarves. Of course none of the children\r\nhappened to have long black hair, but there was a lot of black calico\r\nthat had been bought to cover school-books with. They cut strips of this\r\ninto a sort of fine fringe, and fastened it round their heads with the\r\namber-coloured ribbons off the girls' Sunday dresses. Then they stuck\r\nturkeys' feathers in the ribbons. The calico looked very like long black\r\nhair, especially when the strips began to curl up a bit.\r\n\r\n\"But our faces,\" said Anthea, \"they're not at all the right colour.\r\nWe're all rather pale, and I'm sure I don't know why, but Cyril is the\r\ncolour of putty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"The real Indians outside seem to be brownish,\" said Robert hastily. \"I\r\nthink we ought to be really _red_--it's sort of superior to have a red\r\nskin, if you are one.\"\r\n\r\nThe red ochre cook uses for the kitchen bricks seemed to be about the\r\nreddest thing in the house. The children mixed some in a saucer with\r\nmilk, as they had seen cook do for the kitchen floor. Then they\r\ncarefully painted each other's faces and hands with it, till they were\r\nquite as red as any Red Indian need be--if not redder.\r\n\r\nThey knew at once that they must look very terrible when they met Eliza\r\nin the passage, and she screamed aloud. This unsolicited testimonial\r\npleased them very much. Hastily telling her not to be a goose, and that\r\nit was only a game, the four blanketed, feathered, really and truly\r\nRedskins went boldly out to meet the foe. I say boldly. That is because\r\nI wish to be polite. At any rate, they went.\r\n\r\nAlong the hedge dividing the wilderness from the garden was a row of\r\ndark heads, all highly feathered.\r\n\r\n\"It's our only chance,\" whispered Anthea. \"Much better than to wait for\r\ntheir blood-freezing attack. We must pretend like mad. Like that game of\r\ncards where you pretend you've got aces when you haven't. Fluffing they\r\ncall it, I think. Now then. Whoop!\"\r\n\r\nWith four wild war-whoops--or as near them as white children could be\r\nexpected to go without any previous practice--they rushed through the\r\ngate and struck four war-like attitudes in face of the line of Red\r\nIndians. These were all about the same height, and that height was\r\nCyril's.\r\n\r\n\"I hope to goodness they can talk English,\" said Cyril through his\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nAnthea knew they could, though she never knew how she came to know it.\r\nShe had a white towel tied to a walking-stick. This was a flag of truce,\r\nand she waved it, in the hope that the Indians would know what it was.\r\nApparently they did--for one who was browner than the others stepped\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"Ye seek a pow-wow?\" he said in excellent English. \"I am Golden Eagle,\r\nof the mighty tribe of Rock-dwellers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Ye seek a pow-wow?\" he said]\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Anthea, with a sudden inspiration, \"am the Black\r\nPanther--chief of the--the--the--Mazawattee tribe. My brothers--I don't\r\nmean--yes, I do--the tribe--I mean the Mazawattees--are in ambush below\r\nthe brow of yonder hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what mighty warriors be these?\" asked Golden Eagle, turning to the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nCyril said he was the great chief Squirrel, of the Moning Congo tribe,\r\nand, seeing that Jane was sucking her thumb and could evidently think of\r\nno name for herself, he added, \"This great warrior is Wild Cat--Pussy\r\nFerox we call it in this land--leader of the vast Phiteezi tribe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thou, valorous Redskin?\" Golden Eagle inquired suddenly of Robert,\r\nwho, taken unawares, could only reply that he was Bobs--leader of the\r\nCape Mounted Police.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Black Panther, \"our tribes, if we just whistle them up,\r\nwill far outnumber your puny forces; so resistance is useless. Return,\r\ntherefore, to your land, O brother, and smoke pipes of peace in your\r\nwampums with your squaws and your medicine-men, and dress yourselves in\r\nthe gayest wigwams, and eat happily of the juicy fresh-caught\r\nmoccasins.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got it all wrong,\" murmured Cyril angrily. But Golden Eagle only\r\nlooked inquiringly at her.\r\n\r\n\"Thy customs are other than ours, O Black Panther,\" he said. \"Bring up\r\nthy tribe, that we may hold pow-wow in state before them, as becomes\r\ngreat chiefs.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll bring them up right enough,\" said Anthea, \"with their bows and\r\narrows, and tomahawks and scalping-knives, and everything you can think\r\nof, if you don't look sharp and go.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke bravely enough, but the hearts of all the children were\r\nbeating furiously, and their breath came in shorter and shorter gasps.\r\nFor the little real Red Indians were closing up round them--coming\r\nnearer and nearer with angry murmurs--so that they were the centre of a\r\ncrowd of dark cruel faces.\r\n\r\n\"It's no go,\" whispered Robert. \"I knew it wouldn't be. We must make a\r\nbolt for the Psammead. It might help us. If it doesn't--well, I suppose\r\nwe shall come alive again at sunset. I wonder if scalping hurts as much\r\nas they say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wave the flag again,\" said Anthea. \"If they stand back, we'll run\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\nShe waved the towel, and the chief commanded his followers to stand\r\nback. Then, charging wildly at the place where the line of Indians was\r\nthinnest, the four children started to run. Their first rush knocked\r\ndown some half-dozen Indians, over whose blanketed bodies the children\r\nleaped, and made straight for the sand-pit. This was no time for the\r\nsafe easy way by which carts go down--right over the edge of the\r\nsand-pit they went, among the yellow and pale purple flowers and dried\r\ngrasses, past the little bank martins' little front doors, skipping,\r\nclinging, bounding, stumbling, sprawling, and finally rolling.\r\n\r\nYellow Eagle and his followers came up with them just at the very spot\r\nwhere they had seen the Psammead that morning.\r\n\r\nBreathless and beaten, the wretched children now awaited their fate.\r\nSharp knives and axes gleamed round them, but worse than these was the\r\ncruel light in the eyes of Golden Eagle and his followers.\r\n\r\n\"Ye have lied to us, O Black Panther of the Mazawattees--and thou, too,\r\nSquirrel of the Moning Congos. These also, Pussy Ferox of the Phiteezi,\r\nand Bobs of the Cape Mounted Police,--these also have lied to us, if not\r\nwith their tongues, yet by their silence. Ye have lied under the cover\r\nof the Truce-flag of the Pale-face. Ye have no followers. Your tribes\r\nare far away--following the hunting trail. What shall be their doom?\" he\r\nconcluded, turning with a bitter smile to the other Red Indians.\r\n\r\n\"Build we the fire!\" shouted his followers; and at once a dozen ready\r\nvolunteers started to look for fuel. The four children, each held\r\nbetween two strong little Indians, cast despairing glances round them.\r\nOh, if they could only see the Psammead!\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to scalp us first and then roast us?\" asked Anthea\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\" Redskin opened his eyes at her. \"It's always done.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians had formed a ring round the children, and now sat on the\r\nground gazing at their captives. There was a threatening silence.\r\n\r\nThen slowly, by twos and threes, the Indians who had gone to look for\r\nfirewood came back, and they came back empty-handed. They had not been\r\nable to find a single stick of wood for a fire! No one ever can, as a\r\nmatter of fact, in that part of Kent.\r\n\r\nThe children drew a deep breath of relief, but it ended in a moan of\r\nterror. For bright knives were being brandished all about them. Next\r\nmoment each child was seized by an Indian; each closed its eyes and\r\ntried not to scream. They waited for the sharp agony of the knife. It\r\ndid not come. Next moment they were released, and fell in a trembling\r\nheap. Their heads did not hurt at all. They only felt strangely cool!\r\nWild war-whoops rang in their ears. When they ventured to open their\r\neyes they saw four of their foes dancing round them with wild leaps and\r\nscreams, and each of the four brandished in his hand a scalp of long\r\nflowing black hair. They put their hands to their heads--their own\r\nscalps were safe! The poor untutored savages had indeed scalped the\r\nchildren. But they had only, so to speak, scalped them of the black\r\ncalico ringlets!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bright knives were being brandished all about them]\r\n\r\nThe children fell into each other's arms, sobbing and laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Their scalps are ours,\" chanted the chief; \"ill-rooted were their\r\nill-fated hairs! They came off in the hands of the victors--without\r\nstruggle, without resistance, they yielded their scalps to the\r\nconquering Rock-dwellers! Oh, how little a thing is a scalp so lightly\r\nwon!\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll take our real ones in a minute; you see if they don't,\" said\r\nRobert, trying to rub some of the red ochre off his face and hands on to\r\nhis hair.\r\n\r\n\"Cheated of our just and fiery revenge are we,\" the chant went on,--\"but\r\nthere are other torments than the scalping-knife and the flames. Yet is\r\nthe slow fire the correct thing. O strange unnatural country, wherein a\r\nman may find no wood to burn his enemy!--Ah for the boundless forests of\r\nmy native land, where the great trees for thousands of miles grow but to\r\nfurnish firewood wherewithal to burn our foes. Ah, would we were but in\r\nour native forest once more!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly like a flash of lightning, the golden gravel shone all round\r\nthe four children instead of the dusky figures. For every single\r\nIndian had vanished on the instant at their leader's word. The Psammead\r\nmust have been there all the time. And it had given the Indian chief his\r\nwish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMartha brought home a jug with a pattern of storks and long grasses on\r\nit. Also she brought back all Anthea's money.\r\n\r\n\"My cousin, she gave me the jug for luck; she said it was an odd one\r\nwhat the basin of had got smashed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Martha, you are a dear!\" sighed Anthea, throwing her arms round\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" giggled Martha, \"you'd better make the most of me while you've\r\ngot me. I shall give your ma notice directly minute she comes back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Martha, we haven't been so _very_ horrid to you, have we?\" asked\r\nAnthea, aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it isn't that, miss.\" Martha giggled more than ever. \"I'm a-goin'\r\nto be married. It's Beale the gamekeeper. He's been a-proposin' to me\r\noff and on ever since you come home from the clergyman's where you got\r\nlocked up on the church-tower. And to-day I said the word an' made him a\r\nhappy man.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnthea put the seven-and-fourpence back in the missionary-box, and\r\npasted paper over the place where the poker had broken it. She was very\r\nglad to be able to do this, and she does not know to this day whether\r\nbreaking open a missionary-box is or is not a hanging matter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI (AND LAST)\r\n\r\nTHE LAST WISH\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course you, who see above that this is the eleventh (and last)\r\nchapter, know very well that the day of which this chapter tells must be\r\nthe last on which Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane will have a chance of\r\ngetting anything out of the Psammead, or Sand-fairy.\r\n\r\nBut the children themselves did not know this. They were full of rosy\r\nvisions, and, whereas on the other days they had often found it\r\nextremely difficult to think of anything really nice to wish for, their\r\nbrains were now full of the most beautiful and sensible ideas. \"This,\"\r\nas Jane remarked afterwards, \"is always the way.\" Everyone was up extra\r\nearly that morning, and these plans were hopefully discussed in the\r\ngarden before breakfast. The old idea of one hundred pounds in modern\r\nflorins was still first favourite, but there were others that ran it\r\nclose--the chief of these being the \"pony-each\" idea. This had a great\r\nadvantage. You could wish for a pony each during the morning, ride it\r\nall day, have it vanish at sunset, and wish it back again next day.\r\nWhich would be an economy of litter and stabling. But at breakfast two\r\nthings happened. First, there was a letter from mother. Granny was\r\nbetter, and mother and father hoped to be home that very afternoon. A\r\ncheer arose. And of course this news at once scattered all the\r\nbefore-breakfast wish-ideas. For everyone saw quite plainly that the\r\nwish of the day must be something to please mother and not to please\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what she _would_ like,\" pondered Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"She'd like us all to be good,\" said Jane primly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but that's so dull for us,\" Cyril rejoined; \"and besides, I should\r\nhope we could be that without sand-fairies to help us. No; it must be\r\nsomething splendid, that we couldn't possibly get without wishing for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out,\" said Anthea in a warning voice; \"don't forget yesterday.\r\nRemember, we get our wishes now just wherever we happen to be when we\r\nsay 'I wish.' Don't let's let ourselves in for anything silly--to-day of\r\nall days.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Cyril. \"You needn't talk so much.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Martha came in with a jug full of hot water for the\r\ntea-pot--and a face full of importance for the children.\r\n\r\n\"A blessing we're all alive to eat our breakfast!\" she said darkly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, whatever's happened?\" everybody asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" said Martha, \"only it seems nobody's safe from being\r\nmurdered in their beds nowadays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Jane as an agreeable thrill of horror ran down her back and\r\nlegs and out at her toes, \"_has_ anyone been murdered in their beds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--not exactly,\" said Martha; \"but they might just as well. There's\r\nbeen burglars over at Peasemarsh Place--Beale's just told me--and\r\nthey've took every single one of Lady Chittenden's diamonds and jewels\r\nand things, and she's a-goin out of one fainting fit into another, with\r\nhardly time to say 'Oh, my diamonds!' in between. And Lord Chittenden's\r\naway in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady Chittenden,\" said Anthea; \"we've seen her. She wears a\r\nred-and-white dress, and she has no children of her own and can't abide\r\nother folkses'.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's her,\" said Martha. \"Well, she's put all her trust in riches, and\r\nyou see how she's served. They say the diamonds and things was worth\r\nthousands of pounds. There was a necklace and a river--whatever that\r\nis--and no end of bracelets; and a tarrer and ever so many rings. But\r\nthere, I mustn't stand talking and all the place to clean down afore\r\nyour ma comes home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why she should ever have had such lots of diamonds,\" said\r\nAnthea when Martha had flounced off. \"She was not at all a nice lady, I\r\nthought. And mother hasn't any diamonds, and hardly any jewels--the\r\ntopaz necklace, and the sapphire ring daddy gave her when they were\r\nengaged, and the garnet star, and the little pearl brooch with\r\ngreat-grandpapa's hair in it,--that's about all.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I'm grown up I'll buy mother no end of diamonds,\" said Robert, \"if\r\nshe wants them. I shall make so much money exploring in Africa I shan't\r\nknow what to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be jolly,\" said Jane dreamily, \"if mother could find all\r\nthese lovely things, necklaces and rivers of diamonds and tarrers?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ti--aras_,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"Ti--aras, then,--and rings and everything in her room when she came\r\nhome. I wish she would\"--\r\n\r\nThe others gazed at her in horror.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she _will_,\" said Robert; \"you've wished, my good Jane--and our\r\nonly chance now is to find the Psammead, and if it's in a good temper\r\nit _may_ take back the wish and give us another. If not--well--goodness\r\nknows what we're in for!--the police of course, and---- Don't cry,\r\nsilly! We'll stand by you. Father says we need never to be afraid if we\r\ndon't do anything wrong and always speak the truth.\"\r\n\r\nBut Cyril and Anthea exchanged gloomy glances. They remembered how\r\nconvincing the truth about the Psammead had been once before when told\r\nto the police.\r\n\r\nIt was a day of misfortunes. Of course the Psammead could not be found.\r\nNor the jewels, though every one of the children searched the mother's\r\nroom again and again.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Robert said, \"_we_ couldn't find them. It'll be mother\r\nwho'll do that. Perhaps she'll think they've been in the house for years\r\nand years, and never know they are the stolen ones at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" Cyril was very scornful; \"then mother will be a receiver of\r\nstolen goods, and you know jolly well what _that's_ worse than.\"\r\n\r\nAnother and exhaustive search of the sand-pit failed to reveal the\r\nPsammead, so the children went back to the house slowly and sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" said Anthea stoutly, \"we'll tell mother the truth, and\r\nshe'll give back the jewels--and make everything all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" said Cyril slowly. \"Do you think she'll believe us?\r\nCould anyone believe about a Sammyadd unless they'd seen it? She'll\r\nthink we're pretending. Or else she'll think we're raving mad, and then\r\nwe shall be sent to the mad-house. How would you like it?\"--he turned\r\nsuddenly on the miserable Jane,--\"how would you like it, to be shut up\r\nin an iron cage with bars and padded walls, and nothing to do but stick\r\nstraws in your hair all day, and listen to the howlings and ravings of\r\nthe other maniacs? Make up your minds to it, all of you. It's no use\r\ntelling mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's true,\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is, but it's not true enough for grown-up people to\r\nbelieve it,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"Cyril's right. Let's put flowers in all the vases, and try not to think\r\nabout the diamonds. After all, everything has come right in the end all\r\nthe other times.\"\r\n\r\nSo they filled all the pots they could find with flowers--asters and\r\nzinnias, and loose-leaved late red roses from the wall of the\r\nstableyard, till the house was a perfect bower.\r\n\r\nAnd almost as soon as dinner was cleared away mother arrived, and was\r\nclasped in eight loving arms. It was very difficult indeed not to tell\r\nher all about the Psammead at once, because they had got into the habit\r\nof telling her everything. But they did succeed in not telling her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She was clasped in eight loving arms]\r\n\r\nMother, on her side, had plenty to tell them--about Granny, and Granny's\r\npigeons, and Auntie Emma's lame tame donkey. She was very delighted with\r\nthe flowery-boweryness of the house; and everything seemed so natural\r\nand pleasant, now that she was home again, that the children almost\r\nthought they must have dreamed the Psammead.\r\n\r\nBut, when mother moved towards the stairs to go up to her bedroom and\r\ntake off her bonnet, the eight arms clung round her just as if she only\r\nhad two children, one the Lamb and the other an octopus.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go up, mummy darling,\" said Anthea; \"let me take your things up\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or I will,\" said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\"We want you to come and look at the rose-tree,\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't go up!\" said Jane helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, dears,\" said mother briskly, \"I'm not such an old woman yet\r\nthat I can't take my bonnet off in the proper place. Besides I must wash\r\nthese black hands of mine.\"\r\n\r\nSo up she went, and the children, following her, exchanged glances of\r\ngloomy foreboding.\r\n\r\nMother took off her bonnet,--it was a very pretty hat, really, with\r\nwhite roses in it,--and when she had taken it off she went to the\r\ndressing-table to do her pretty hair.\r\n\r\nOn the table between the ring-stand and the pin-cushion lay a green\r\nleather case. Mother opened it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how lovely!\" she cried. It was a ring, a large pearl with shining\r\nmany-lighted diamonds set round it. \"Wherever did this come from?\"\r\nmother asked, trying it on her wedding finger, which it fitted\r\nbeautifully. \"However did it come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said each of the children truthfully.\r\n\r\n\"Father must have told Martha to put it here,\" mother said. \"I'll run\r\ndown and ask her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me look at it,\" said Anthea, who knew Martha would not be able to\r\nsee the ring. But when Martha was asked, of course she denied putting\r\nthe ring there, and so did Eliza and cook.\r\n\r\nMother came back to her bedroom, very much interested and pleased about\r\nthe ring. But, when she opened the dressing-table drawer and found a\r\nlong case containing an almost priceless diamond necklace, she was more\r\ninterested still, though not so pleased. In the wardrobe, when she went\r\nto put away her \"bonnet,\" she found a tiara and several brooches, and\r\nthe rest of the jewellery turned up in various parts of the room during\r\nthe next half-hour. The children looked more and more uncomfortable, and\r\nnow Jane began to sniff.\r\n\r\nMother looked at her gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Jane,\" she said, \"I am sure you know something about this. Now think\r\nbefore you speak, and tell me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"We found a Fairy,\" said Jane obediently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We found a Fairy,\" said Jane obediently]\r\n\r\n\"No nonsense, please,\" said her mother sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly, Jane,\" Cyril interrupted. Then he went on desperately.\r\n\"Look here, mother, we've never seen the things before, but Lady\r\nChittenden at Peasmarsh Place lost all her jewellery by wicked burglars\r\nlast night. Could this possibly be it?\"\r\n\r\nAll drew a deep breath. They were saved.\r\n\r\n\"But how could they have put it here? And why should they?\" asked\r\nmother, not unreasonably. \"Surely it would have been easier and safer to\r\nmake off with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said Cyril, \"they thought it better to wait for--for\r\nsunset--nightfall, I mean, before they went off with it. No one but us\r\nknew that you were coming back to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must send for the police at once,\" said mother distractedly. \"Oh, how\r\nI wish daddy were here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better to wait till he _does_ come?\" asked Robert,\r\nknowing that his father would not be home before sunset.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I can't wait a minute with all this on my mind,\" cried mother.\r\n\"All this\" was the heap of jewel-cases on the bed. They put them all in\r\nthe wardrobe, and mother locked it. Then mother called Martha.\r\n\r\n\"Martha,\" she said, \"has any stranger been into my room since I've been\r\naway? Now, answer me truthfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mum,\" answered Martha; \"leastways, what I mean to say\"--\r\n\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said her mistress kindly, \"I see someone has. You must tell me\r\nat once. Don't be frightened. I'm sure _you_ haven't done anything\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nMartha burst into heavy sobs.\r\n\r\n\"I was a-goin' to give you warning this very day, mum, to leave at the\r\nend of my month, so I was,--on account of me being going to make a\r\nrespectable young man happy. A gamekeeper he is by trade, mum--and I\r\nwouldn't deceive you--of the name of Beale. And it's as true as I stand\r\nhere, it was your coming home in such a hurry, and no warning given, out\r\nof the kindness of his heart it was, as he says, 'Martha, my beauty,' he\r\nsays,--which I ain't, and never was, but you know how them men will go\r\non,--'I can't see you a-toiling and a-moiling and not lend a 'elping\r\n'and; which mine is a strong arm, and it's yours Martha, my dear,' says\r\nhe. And so he helped me a-cleanin' of the windows--but outside, mum, the\r\nwhole time, and me in; if I never say another breathing word it's gospel\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you with him the whole time?\" asked her mistress.\r\n\r\n\"Him outside and me in, I was,\" said Martha; \"except for fetching up a\r\nfresh pail and the leather that that slut of a Eliza'd hidden away\r\nbehind the mangle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said the children's mother. \"I am not pleased with you,\r\nMartha, but you have spoken the truth, and that counts for something.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Martha had gone, the children clung round their mother.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mummy darling,\" cried Anthea, \"it isn't Beale's fault, it isn't\r\nreally! He's a great dear; he is, truly and honourably, and as honest as\r\nthe day. Don't let the police take him, mummy! Oh, don't, don't, don't!\"\r\n\r\nIt was truly awful. Here was an innocent man accused of robbery through\r\nthat silly wish of Jane's, and it was absolutely useless to tell the\r\ntruth. All longed to, but they thought of the straws in the hair and the\r\nshrieks of the other frantic maniacs, and they could not do it.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a cart hereabouts?\" asked the mother feverishly. \"A trap of\r\nany sort? I must drive in to Rochester and tell the police at once.\"\r\n\r\nAll the children sobbed, \"There's a cart at the farm, but, oh, don't\r\ngo!--don't go!--oh, don't go!--wait till daddy comes home!\"\r\n\r\nMother took not the faintest notice. When she had set her mind on a\r\nthing she always went straight through with it; she was rather like\r\nAnthea in this respect.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Cyril,\" she said, sticking on her hat with long sharp\r\nviolet-headed pins, \"I leave you in charge. Stay in the dressing-room.\r\nYou can pretend to be swimming boats in the bath, or something. Say I\r\ngave you leave. But stay there, with the door on the landing open; I've\r\nlocked the other. And don't let anyone go into my room. Remember, no one\r\nknows the jewels are there except me, and all of you, and the wicked\r\nthieves who put them there. Robert, you stay in the garden and watch the\r\nwindows. If anyone tries to get in you must run and tell the two farm\r\nmen that I'll send up to wait in the kitchen. I'll tell them there are\r\ndangerous characters about--that's true enough. Now remember, I trust\r\nyou both. But I don't think they'll try it till after dark, so you're\r\nquite safe. Good-bye, darlings.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she locked her bedroom door and went off with the key in her pocket.\r\n\r\nThe children could not help admiring the dashing and decided way in\r\nwhich she had acted. They thought how useful she would have been in\r\norganising escape from some of the tight places in which they had found\r\nthemselves of late in consequence of their ill-timed wishes.\r\n\r\n\"She's a born general,\" said Cyril,--\"but _I_ don't know what's going to\r\nhappen to us. Even if the girls were to hunt for that old Sammyadd and\r\nfind it, and get it to take the jewels away again, mother would only\r\nthink we hadn't looked out properly and let the burglars sneak in and\r\nget them--or else the police will think _we've_ got them--or else that\r\nshe's been fooling them. Oh, it's a pretty decent average ghastly mess\r\nthis time, and no mistake!\"\r\n\r\nHe savagely made a paper boat and began to float it in the bath, as he\r\nhad been told to do.\r\n\r\nRobert went into the garden and sat down on the worn yellow grass, with\r\nhis miserable head between his helpless hands.\r\n\r\nAnthea and Jane whispered together in the passage downstairs, where the\r\ncocoanut matting was--with the hole in it that you always caught your\r\nfoot in if you were not careful. Martha's voice could be heard in the\r\nkitchen,--grumbling loud and long.\r\n\r\n\"It's simply quite too dreadfully awful,\" said Anthea. \"How do you know\r\nall the diamonds are there, too? If they aren't, the police will think\r\nmother and father have got them, and that they've only given up some of\r\nthem for a kind of desperate blind. And they'll be put in prison, and we\r\nshall be branded outcasts, the children of felons. And it won't be at\r\nall nice for father and mother either,\" she added, by a candid\r\nafter-thought.\r\n\r\n\"But what can we _do_?\" asked Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing--at least we might look for the Psammead again. It's a very,\r\n_very_ hot day. He may have come out to warm that whisker of his.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't give us any more beastly wishes to-day,\" said Jane flatly. \"He\r\ngets crosser and crosser every time we see him. I believe he hates\r\nhaving to give wishes.\"\r\n\r\nAnthea had been shaking her head gloomily--now she stopped shaking it so\r\nsuddenly that it really looked as though she were pricking up her ears.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Jane. \"Oh, have you thought of something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our one chance,\" cried Anthea dramatically; \"the last lone-lorn forlorn\r\nhope. Come on.\"\r\n\r\nAt a brisk trot she led the way to the sand-pit. Oh, joy!--there was the\r\nPsammead, basking in a golden sandy hollow and preening its whiskers\r\nhappily in the glowing afternoon sun. The moment it saw them it whisked\r\nround and began to burrow--it evidently preferred its own company to\r\ntheirs. But Anthea was too quick for it. She caught it by its furry\r\nshoulders gently but firmly, and held it.\r\n\r\n\"Here--none of that!\" said the Psammead. \"Leave go of me, will you?\"\r\n\r\nBut Anthea held him fast.\r\n\r\n\"Dear kind darling Sammyadd,\" she said breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes--it's all very well,\" it said; \"you want another wish, I expect.\r\nBut I can't keep on slaving from morning till night giving people their\r\nwishes. I must have _some_ time to myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hate giving wishes?\" asked Anthea gently, and her voice trembled\r\nwith excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" it said. \"Leave go of me or I'll bite!--I really\r\nwill--I mean it. Oh, well, if you choose to risk it.\"\r\n\r\nAnthea risked it and held on.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" she said, \"don't bite me--listen to reason. If you'll only\r\ndo what we want to-day, we'll never ask you for another wish as long as\r\nwe live.\"\r\n\r\nThe Psammead was much moved.\r\n\r\n\"I'd do anything,\" it said in a tearful voice. \"I'd almost burst myself\r\nto give you one wish after another, as long as I held out, if you'd only\r\nnever, never ask me to do it after to-day. If you knew how I hate to\r\nblow myself out with other people's wishes, and how frightened I am\r\nalways that I shall strain a muscle or something. And then to wake up\r\nevery morning and know you've _got_ to do it. You don't know what it\r\nis--you don't know what it is, you don't!\" Its voice cracked with\r\nemotion, and the last \"don't\" was a squeak.\r\n\r\nAnthea set it down gently on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"It's all over now,\" she said soothingly. \"We promise faithfully never\r\nto ask for another wish after to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go ahead,\" said the Psammead; \"let's get it over.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many can you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--as long as I can hold out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, first, I wish Lady Chittenden may find she's never lost her\r\njewels.\"\r\n\r\nThe Psammead blew itself out, collapsed, and said, \"Done.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said Anthea more slowly, \"mother mayn't get to the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done,\" said the creature after the proper interval.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said Jane suddenly, \"mother could forget all about the\r\ndiamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done,\" said the Psammead; but its voice was weaker.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to rest a little?\" asked Anthea considerately.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, please,\" said the Psammead; \"and, before we go any further, will\r\nyou wish something for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you do wishes for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" it said; \"we were always expected to give each other\r\nour wishes--not that we had any to speak of in the good old Megatherium\r\ndays. Just wish, will you, that you may never be able, any of you, to\r\ntell anyone a word about _Me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see, if you told grown-ups I should have no peace of my\r\nlife. They'd get hold of me, and they wouldn't wish silly things like\r\nyou do, but real earnest things; and the scientific people would hit on\r\nsome way of making things last after sunset, as likely as not; and\r\nthey'd ask for a graduated income-tax, and old-age pensions, and manhood\r\nsuffrage, and free secondary education, and dull things like that; and\r\nget them, and keep them, and the whole world would be turned\r\ntopsy-turvy. Do wish it! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nAnthea repeated the Psammead's wish, and it blew itself out to a larger\r\nsize than they had yet seen it attain.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" it said as it collapsed, \"can I do anything more for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just one thing; and I think that clears everything up, doesn't it,\r\nJane? I wish Martha to forget about the diamond ring, and mother to\r\nforget about the keeper cleaning the windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like the 'Brass Bottle,'\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm glad we read that or I should never have thought of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the Psammead faintly, \"I'm almost worn out. Is there\r\nanything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; only thank you kindly for all you've done for us, and I hope you'll\r\nhave a good long sleep, and I hope we shall see you again some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that a wish?\" it said in a weak voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, please,\" said the two girls together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely to the\r\nlast]\r\n\r\nThen for the last time in this story they saw the Psammead blow itself\r\nout and collapse suddenly. It nodded to them, blinked its long snail's\r\neyes, burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely to the last, and\r\nthe sand closed over it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I hope we've done right?\" said Jane.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure we have,\" said Anthea. \"Come on home and tell the boys.\"\r\n\r\nAnthea found Cyril glooming over his paper boats, and told him. Jane\r\ntold Robert. The two tales were only just ended when mother walked in,\r\nhot and dusty. She explained that as she was being driven into Rochester\r\nto buy the girls' autumn school-dresses the axle had broken, and but for\r\nthe narrowness of the lane and the high soft hedges she would have been\r\nthrown out. As it was, she was not hurt, but she had had to walk home.\r\n\"And oh, my dearest dear chicks,\" she said, \"I am simply dying for a cup\r\nof tea! Do run and see if the water boils!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you see it's all right,\" Jane whispered. \"She doesn't remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more does Martha,\" said Anthea, who had been to ask after the state\r\nof the kettle.\r\n\r\nAs the servants sat at their tea, Beale the gamekeeper dropped in. He\r\nbrought the welcome news that Lady Chittenden's diamonds had not been\r\nlost at all. Lord Chittenden had taken them to be re-set and cleaned,\r\nand the maid who knew about it had gone for a holiday. So that was all\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we ever shall see the Psammead again,\" said Jane wistfully\r\nas they walked in the garden, while mother was putting the Lamb to bed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure we shall,\" said Cyril, \"if you really wished it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've promised never to ask it for another wish,\" said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\"I never want to,\" said Robert earnestly.\r\n\r\nThey did see it again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not\r\nin a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It was\r\nin a---- But I must say no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's notes:\r\n\r\nVaried hyphenation retained where a majority could not be found.\r\nExceptions noted.\r\n\r\nPage 60, \"Peasemarch\" changed to \"Peasemarsh\" to conform to rest of\r\ntext. \"Billy Peasemarsh.\"\r\n\r\nPage 111, \"hasily\" changed to \"hastily\" in \"Jane hastily finished\".\r\n\r\nPage 116, extraneous \" removed. \"better.
