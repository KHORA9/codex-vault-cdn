Like\r\n\"Nobody's Boy\" it was also crowned by the Academy, and that literary\r\njudgment has also been verified by the test of time.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody's Girl\" is not a human document, such as is \"Nobody's Boy\", because\r\nit has more story plot, and the adventure is in a more restricted field,\r\nbut it discloses no less the nobility of a right-minded child, and how\r\nloyalty wins the way to noble deeds and life. This is another beautiful\r\nliterary creation of Hector Malot which every one can recommend as an\r\nennobling book, of interest not only to childhood, page by page to the\r\nthrilling conclusion, but to every person who loves romance and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOnly details, irrelevant for readers in America, have been eliminated.\r\nLittle Perrine's loyal ideals, with their inspiring sentiments, are\r\npreserved by her through the most discouraging conditions, and are\r\ndescribed with the simplicity for which Hector Malot is famous. The\r\nbuilding up of a little girl's life is made a fine example for every\r\nchild. Every reader of this story leaves it inspired for the better way.\r\n\r\n                                                    THE PUBLISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBODY'S GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPERRINE AND PALIKARE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday afternoon about 3 o'clock. There was the usual scene;\r\noutside the Gates of Bercy there was a crowd of people, and on the\r\nquays, four rows deep, carts and wagons were massed together. Coal\r\ncarts, carts heaped with hay and straw, all were waiting in the clear,\r\nwarm June sunshine for the examination from the custom official. All had\r\nbeen hurrying to reach Paris before Sunday.\r\n\r\nAmongst the wagons, but at some little distance from the Gates, stood an\r\nodd looking cart, a sort of caravan. Over a light frame work which was\r\nerected on four wheels was stretched a heavy canvas; this was fastened\r\nto the light roof which covered the wagon. Once upon a time the canvas\r\nmight have been blue, but it was so faded, so dirty and worn, that one\r\ncould only guess what its original color had been. Neither was it\r\npossible to make out the inscriptions which were painted on the four\r\nsides. Most of the words were effaced. On one side there was a Greek\r\nword, the next side bore part of a German word, on the third side were\r\nthe letters F I A, which was evidently Italian, and on the last a newly\r\npainted French word stood out boldly. This was _PHOTOGRAPHIE_, and was\r\nevidently the translation of all the others, indicating the different\r\ncountries through which the miserable wagon had come before it had\r\nentered France and finally arrived at the Gates of Paris.\r\n\r\nWas it possible that the donkey that was harnessed to it had brought the\r\ncart all this distance? At first glance it seemed impossible, but\r\nalthough the animal was tired out, one could see upon a closer view that\r\nit was very robust and much bigger than the donkeys that one sees in\r\nEurope. Its coat was a beautiful dark grey, the beauty of which could be\r\nseen despite the dust which covered it. Its slender legs were marked\r\nwith jet black lines, and worn out though the poor beast was, it still\r\nheld its head high. The harness, worthy of the caravan, was fastened\r\ntogether with various colored strings, short pieces, long pieces, just\r\nwhat was at hand at the moment; the strings had been carefully hidden\r\nunder the flowers and branches which had been gathered along the roads\r\nand used to protect the animal from the sun and the flies.\r\n\r\nClose by, seated on the edge of the curb, watching the donkey, was a\r\nlittle girl of about thirteen years of age. Her type was very unusual,\r\nbut it was quite apparent that there was a mixture of race. The pale\r\nblond of her hair contrasted strangely with the deep, rich coloring of\r\nher cheeks, and the sweet expression of her face was accentuated by the\r\ndark, serious eyes. Her mouth also was very serious. Her figure, slim\r\nand full of grace, was garbed in an old, faded check dress, but the\r\nshabby old frock could not take away the child's distinguished air.\r\n\r\nAs the donkey had stopped just behind a large cart of straw, it would\r\nnot have required much watching, but every now and again he pulled out\r\nthe straw, in a cautious manner, like a very intelligent animal that\r\nknows quite well that it is doing wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Palikare! stop that!\" said the girl for the third time.\r\n\r\nThe donkey again dropped his head in a guilty fashion, but as soon as he\r\nhad eaten his wisps of straw he began to blink his eyes and agitate his\r\nears, then again discreetly, but eagerly, tugged at what was ahead of\r\nhim; this in a manner that testified to the poor beast's hunger.\r\n\r\nWhile the little girl was scolding him, a voice from within the caravan\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n\"Perrine!\"\r\n\r\nJumping to her feet, the child lifted up the canvas and passed inside,\r\nwhere a pale, thin woman was lying on a mattress.\r\n\r\n\"Do you need me, mama?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is Palikare doing, dear?\" asked the woman.\r\n\r\n\"He is eating the straw off the cart that's ahead of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must stop him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's so hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hunger is not an excuse for taking what does not belong to us. What will\r\nyou say to the driver of that cart if he's angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go and see that Palikare doesn't do it again,\" said the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we soon be in Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are waiting for the customs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have we much longer to wait?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but are you in more pain, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, darling; it's because I'm closed in here,\" replied the woman,\r\ngasping. Then she smiled wanly, hoping to reassure her daughter.\r\n\r\nThe woman was in a pitiable plight. All her strength had gone and she could\r\nscarcely breathe. Although she was only about twenty-nine years of age, her\r\nlife was ebbing away. There still remained traces of remarkable beauty: Her\r\nhead and hair were lovely, and her eyes were soft and dark like her\r\ndaughter's.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I give you something?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some shops near by. I can buy a lemon. I'll come back at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, keep the money. We have so little. Go back to Palikare and stop him\r\nfrom eating the straw.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not easy,\" answered the little girl.\r\n\r\nShe went back to the donkey and pushed him on his haunches until he was\r\nout of reach of the straw in front of him.\r\n\r\nAt first the donkey was obstinate and tried to push forward again, but she\r\nspoke to him gently and stroked him, and kissed him on his nose; then he\r\ndropped his long ears with evident satisfaction and stood quite still.\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion to worry about him now, so she amused herself with\r\nwatching what was going on around her.\r\n\r\nA little boy about her own age, dressed up like a clown, and who evidently\r\nbelonged to the circus caravans standing in the rear, had been strolling\r\nround her for ten long minutes, without being able to attract her\r\nattention. At last he decided to speak to her.\r\n\r\n\"That's a fine donkey,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply.\r\n\r\n\"It don't belong to this country. If it does, I'm astonished.\"\r\n\r\nShe was looking at him, and thinking that after all he looked rather\r\nlike a nice boy, she thought she would reply.\r\n\r\n\"He comes from Greece,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Greece!\" he echoed.\r\n\r\n\"That's why he's called Palikare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's why.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his broad grin he was not at all sure why a donkey that\r\ncame from Greece should be called Palikare.\r\n\r\n\"Is it far ... Greece?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farther than ... China?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but it's a long way off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then yer come from Greece, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, farther than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"From China?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but Palikare's the only one that comes from Greece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to the Fair?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where yer goin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Into Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, but where yer goin' to put up that there cart?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've been told that there are some free places round the\r\nfortifications.\"\r\n\r\nThe little clown slapped his thighs with his two hands.\r\n\r\n\"The fortifications: _Oh la la!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there any place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It ain't the place for you ... round the fortifications! Have yer got\r\nany men with yer? Big strong men who are not afraid of a stab from a\r\ndagger. One who can give a jab as well as take one.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only my mother and me, and mother is ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think much of that donkey?\" he asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I should say so!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the first thing he'll be stolen. He'll be gone tomorrow. Then\r\nthe rest'll come after, and it's Fatty as tells yer so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Should say so! You've never been to Paris before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's easy to see. Some fools told you where to put your cart up, but\r\nyou can't put it there. Why don't you go to Grain-of-Salt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know Grain-of-Salt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he owns the Guillot Fields. You needn't be afraid of him, and he'd\r\nshoot anybody who tried to get in his place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it cost much to go there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It costs a lot in winter, when everybody comes to Paris, but at this\r\ntime I'm sure he won't make you pay more than forty sous a week. And\r\nyour donkey can find its food in the field. Does he like thistles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say he does like them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, this is just the place for him, and Grain-of-Salt isn't a\r\nbad chap,\" said the little clown with a satisfied air.\r\n\r\n\"Is that his name ... Grain-of-Salt?\"\r\n\r\n\"They call him that 'cause he's always thirsty. He's only got one arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is his place far from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, at Charonne; but I bet yer don't even know where Charonne is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never been to Paris before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, it's over there.\" He waved his arms vaguely in a northerly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"Once you have passed through the Gates, you turn straight to the\r\nright,\" he explained, \"and you follow the road all along the\r\nfortifications for half an hour, then go down a wide avenue, then turn\r\nto your left, and then ask where the Guillot Field is. Everybody knows\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I'll go and tell mama. If you'll stand beside Palikare for a\r\nminute, I'll go and tell her at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I'll mind him for yer. I'll ask him to teach me Greek.\"\r\n\r\n\"And please don't let him eat that straw.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine went inside the caravan and told her mother what the little\r\nclown had said.\r\n\r\n\"If that is so,\" said the sick woman, \"we must not hesitate; we must go\r\nto Charonne. But can you find the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's easy enough. Oh, mother,\" she added, as she was going out,\r\n\"there are such a lot of wagons outside; they have printed on them\r\n'Maraucourt Factories,' and beneath that the name, 'Vulfran\r\nPaindavoine.' There are all kinds of barrels and things in the carts.\r\nSuch a number!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing remarkable in that, my child,\" said the woman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it's strange to see so many wagons with the same name on\r\nthem,\" replied the girl as she left the caravan.\r\n\r\nPerrine found the donkey with his nose buried in the straw, which he was\r\neating calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you're letting him eat it!\" she cried to the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, why not?\" he retorted.\r\n\r\n\"And if the man is angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd better not be with me,\" said the small boy, putting himself in a\r\nposition to fight and throwing his head back.\r\n\r\nBut his prowess was not to be brought into action, for at this moment\r\nthe custom officer began to search the cart of straw, and then gave\r\npermission for it to pass on through the Gates of Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Now it's your turn,\" said the boy, \"and I'll have to leave you.\r\nGoodbye, Mademoiselle. If you ever want news of me ask for Double Fat.\r\nEverybody knows me.\"\r\n\r\nThe employés who guard the entrances of Paris are accustomed to strange\r\nsights, yet the man who went into Perrine's caravan looked surprised\r\nwhen he found a young woman lying on a mattress, and even more surprised\r\nwhen his hasty glance revealed to him the extreme poverty of her\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\"Have you anything to declare?\" he asked, continuing his investigations.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wine, no provisions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThis was only too true; apart from the mattress, the two cane chairs, a\r\nlittle table, a tiny stove, a camera and a few photographic supplies,\r\nthere was nothing in this wagon; no trunks, no baskets, no clothes....\r\n\r\n\"All right; you can pass,\" said the man.\r\n\r\nOnce through the Gates, Perrine, holding Palikare by the bridle,\r\nfollowed the stretch of grass along the embankment. In the brown, dirty\r\ngrass she saw rough looking men lying on their backs or on their\r\nstomachs. She saw now the class of people who frequent this spot. From\r\nthe very air of these men, with their bestial, criminal faces, she\r\nunderstood why it would be unsafe for them to be there at night. She\r\ncould well believe that their knives would be in ready use.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the city, she saw nothing but dirty streets and filthy\r\nhouses. So this was Paris, the beautiful Paris of which her father had\r\nso often spoken. With one word she made her donkey go faster, then\r\nturning to the left she inquired for the Guillot Field.\r\n\r\nIf everyone knew where it was situated, no two were of the same opinion\r\nas to which road she should take to get there, and several times, in\r\ntrying to follow the various directions which were given to her, she\r\nlost her way.\r\n\r\nAt last she found the place for which she was looking. This must be it!\r\nInside the field there was an old omnibus without wheels, and a railway\r\ncar, also without wheels, was on the ground. In addition, she saw a\r\ndozen little round pups rolling about. Yes, this was the place!\r\n\r\nLeaving Palikare in the street, she went into the field. The pups at\r\nonce scrambled at her feet, barked, and snapped at her shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" called a voice.\r\n\r\nShe looked around and saw a long, low building, which might have been a\r\nhouse, but which might serve for anything else. The walls were made of\r\nbits of stone, wood and plaster. Even tin boxes were used in its\r\nconstruction. The roof was made of tarred canvas and cardboard, and most\r\nof the window panes were of paper, although in one or two instances\r\nthere was some glass. The man who designed it was another Robinson\r\nCrusoe, and his workman a man Friday.\r\n\r\nA one-armed man with a shaggy beard was sorting out rags and throwing\r\nthem into the baskets around him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't step on my dogs,\" he cried; \"come nearer.\"\r\n\r\nShe did as she was told.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the owner of the Guillot Field?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's me!\" replied the man.\r\n\r\nIn a few words she told him what she wanted. So as not to waste his time\r\nwhile listening, he poured some red wine out of a bottle that stood on\r\nthe ground and drank it down at a gulp.\r\n\r\n\"It can be arranged if you pay in advance,\" he said, sizing her up.\r\n\r\n\"How much?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Forty sous a week for the wagon and twenty for the donkey,\" he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"That's a lot of money,\" she said, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"That's my price.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your summer price?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my summer price.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can my donkey eat the thistles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the grass also if his teeth are strong enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't pay for the whole week because we are only going to stay one\r\nday. We are going through Paris on our way to Amiens, and we want to\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's all right; six sous a day for the cart and three for the\r\ndonkey.\"\r\n\r\nOne by one she pulled out nine sous from the pocket in her skirt.\r\n\r\n\"That's for the first day,\" she said, handing them to the man.\r\n\r\n\"You can tell your people they can all come in,\" he said, \"How many are\r\nthere? If it's a whole company it's two sous extra for each person.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; but why didn't your mother come and settle this?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is in the wagon, ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ill! Well, this isn't a hospital.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine was afraid that he would not let her sick mother come in.\r\n\r\n\"I mean she's a little bit tired. We've come a long way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never ask people where they come from,\" replied the man gruffly. He\r\npointed to a corner of the field, and added: \"You can put your wagon\r\nover there and tie up the donkey. And if it squashes one of my pups\r\nyou'll pay me five francs, one hundred sous ... understand?\"\r\n\r\nAs she was going he called out:\r\n\r\n\"Will you take a glass of wine?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks,\" she replied; \"I never take wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" he said; \"I'll drink it for you.\"\r\n\r\nHe drained another glass, then returned to his collection of rags.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had installed Palikare in the place that the man had\r\npointed out to her, which was accomplished not without some jolts,\r\ndespite the care which she took, Perrine climbed up into the wagon.\r\n\r\n\"We've arrived at last, poor mama,\" she said, bending over the woman.\r\n\r\n\"No more shaking, no more rolling about,\" said the woman weakly.\r\n\r\n\"There, there; I'll make you some dinner,\" said Perrine cheerfully.\r\n\"What would you like?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, dear, unharness Palikare; he is very tired also; and give him\r\nsomething to eat and drink.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine did as her mother told her, then returned to the wagon and took\r\nout the small stove, some pieces of coal and an old saucepan and some\r\nsticks. Outside, she went down on her knees and made a fire; at last,\r\nafter blowing with all her might, she had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthat it had taken.\r\n\r\n\"You'd like some rice, wouldn't you?\" she asked, leaning over her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"I am not hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything else you would fancy? I'll go and fetch anything you\r\nwant. What would you like, mama, dearie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I prefer rice,\" said her mother.\r\n\r\nLittle Perrine threw a handful of rice into the saucepan that she had\r\nput on the fire and waited for the water to boil; then she stirred the\r\nrice with two white sticks that she had stripped of their bark. She only\r\nleft her cooking once, to run over to Palikare to say a few loving words\r\nto him. The donkey was eating the thistles with a satisfaction, the\r\nintensity of which was shown by the way his long ears stood up.\r\n\r\nWhen the rice was cooked to perfection, Perrine filled a bowl and placed\r\nit at her mother's bedside, also two glasses, two plates and two forks.\r\nSitting down on the floor, with her legs tucked under her and her skirts\r\nspread out, she said, like a little girl who is playing with her doll:\r\n\"Now we'll have a little din-din, mammy, dear, and I'll wait on you.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her gay tone, there was an anxious look in the child's eyes\r\nas she looked at her mother lying on the mattress, covered with an old\r\nshawl that had once been beautiful and costly, but was now only a faded\r\nrag.\r\n\r\nThe sick woman tried to swallow a mouthful of rice, then she looked at\r\nher daughter with a wan smile.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't go down very well,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"You must force yourself,\" said Perrine; \"the second will go down\r\nbetter, and the third better still.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot; no, I cannot, dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mama!\"\r\n\r\nThe mother sank back on her mattress, gasping. But weak though she was,\r\nshe thought of her little girl and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"The rice is delicious, dear,\" she said; \"you eat it. As you do the work\r\nyou must feed well. You must be very strong to be able to nurse me, so\r\neat, darling, eat.\"\r\n\r\nKeeping back her tears, Perrine made an effort to eat her dinner. Her\r\nmother continued to talk to her. Little by little she stopped crying and\r\nall the rice disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you try to eat, mother?\" she asked. \"I forced myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm ill, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I ought to go and fetch a doctor. We are in Paris now and there\r\nare good doctors here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good doctors will not put themselves out unless they are paid.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"With what, my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"With our money. You have seven francs in your pocket and a florin which\r\nwe could change here. I've got 17 sous. Feel in your pocket.\"\r\n\r\nThe black dress, as worn as Perrine's skirt but not so dusty, for it had\r\nbeen brushed, was lying on the bed, and served for a cover. They found\r\nthe seven francs and an Austrian coin.\r\n\r\n\"How much does that make in all?\" asked Perrine; \"I don't understand\r\nFrench money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know very little more than you,\" replied her mother.\r\n\r\nCounting the florin at two francs, they found they had nine francs and\r\neighty-five centimes.\r\n\r\n\"You see we have more than what is needed for a doctor,\" insisted\r\nPerrine.\r\n\r\n\"He won't cure me with words; we shall have to buy medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea. You can imagine that all the time I was walking beside\r\nPalikare I did not waste my time just talking to him, although he likes\r\nthat. I was also thinking of both of us, but mostly of you, mama,\r\nbecause you are sick. And I was thinking of our arrival at Maraucourt.\r\nEverybody has laughed at our wagon as we came along, and I am afraid if\r\nwe go to Maraucourt with it we shall not get much of a welcome. If our\r\nrelations are very proud, they'll be humiliated.\r\n\r\n\"So I thought,\" she added, wisely, \"that as we don't need the wagon any\r\nmore, we could sell it. Now that you are ill, no one will let me take\r\ntheir pictures, and even if they would we have not the money to buy the\r\nthings for developing that we need. We must sell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how much can we get for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can get something; then there is the camera and the mattress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything,\" said the sick woman.\r\n\r\n\"But you don't mind, do you, mother, dear?...\"\r\n\r\n\"We have lived in this wagon for more than a year,\" said her mother;\r\n\"your father died here, and although it's a poor thing, it makes me sad\r\nto part with it.... It is all that remains of him ... there is not one\r\nof these old things here that does not remind us of him....\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, gasping; the tears were rolling down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, forgive me, mother, for speaking about it,\" cried Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"My darling, you are right. You are only a child, but you have thought\r\nof the things that I should have. I shall not be better tomorrow nor the\r\nnext day, and we must sell these things, and we must decide to sell....\"\r\n\r\nThe mother hesitated. There was a painful silence.\r\n\r\n\"Palikare,\" said Perrine at last.\r\n\r\n\"You have thought that also?\" asked the mother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Perrine, \"and I have been so unhappy about it, and sometimes\r\nI did not dare look at him for fear he would guess that we were going to\r\npart with him instead of taking him to Maraucourt with us. He would have\r\nbeen so happy there after such a long journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we were only sure of a welcome, but they may turn us away. If they\r\ndo, all we can do then is to lie down by the roadside and die, but no\r\nmatter what it costs, we must get to Maraucourt, and we must present\r\nourselves as well as we can so that they will not shut their doors upon\r\nus....\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that be possible, mama?... The memory of papa ... he was so good.\r\nCould they be angry with him now he is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am speaking as your father would have spoken, dear ... so we will\r\nsell Palikare. With the money that we get for him we will have a doctor,\r\nso that I can get stronger; then, when I am well enough, we will buy a\r\nnice dress for you and one for me, and then we'll start. We will take\r\nthe train as far as we can and walk the rest of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That boy who spoke to me at the Gates told me that Palikare was a fine\r\ndonkey, and he knows, for he is in a circus. It was because he thought\r\nPalikare was so beautiful that he spoke to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how much an Eastern donkey would bring in Paris, but we'll\r\nsee as soon as we can,\" said the sick woman.\r\n\r\nLeaving her mother to rest, Perrine got together their soiled clothing\r\nand decided to do some washing. Adding her own waist to a bundle\r\nconsisting of three handkerchiefs, two pairs of stockings and two\r\ncombinations, she put them all into a basin, and with her washboard and\r\na piece of soap she went outside. She had ready some boiling water which\r\nshe had put on the fire after cooking the rice; this she poured over the\r\nthings. Kneeling on the grass, she soaped and rubbed until all were\r\nclean; then she rinsed them and hung them on a line to dry.\r\n\r\nWhile she worked, Palikare, who was tied up at a short distance from\r\nher, had glanced her way several times. When he saw that she had\r\nfinished her task he stretched his neck towards her and sent forth five\r\nor six brays ... an imperative call.\r\n\r\n\"Did you think I had forgotten you?\" she called out. She went to him,\r\nchanged his place, gave him some water to drink from her saucepan, which\r\nshe had carefully rinsed, for if he was satisfied with all the food that\r\nthey gave him, he was very particular about what he drank. He would only\r\ndrink pure water from a clean vessel, or red wine ... this he liked\r\nbetter than anything.\r\n\r\nShe stroked him and talked to him lovingly, like a kind nurse would to a\r\nlittle child, and the donkey, who had thrown himself down on the grass\r\nthe moment he was free, placed his head against her shoulder. He loved\r\nhis young mistress, and every now and again he looked up at her and\r\nshook his long ears in sign of utter content.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet in the field and the streets close by were now deserted.\r\nFrom the distance came the dim roar of the great city, deep, powerful,\r\nmysterious; the breath and life of Paris, active and incessant, seemed\r\nlike the roar of a mighty ocean going on and on, in spite of the night\r\nthat falls.\r\n\r\nThen, in the softness of the coming night, little Perrine seemed to feel\r\nmore impressed with the talk that she had had with her mother, and\r\nleaning her head against her donkey's, she let the tears, which she had\r\nkept back so long, flow silently, and Palikare, in mute sympathy, bent\r\nhis head and licked her hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGRAIN-OF-SALT IS KIND\r\n\r\n\r\nMany times that night Perrine, lying beside her mother, had jumped up and\r\nrun to the well for water so as to have it fresh. In spite of her desire to\r\nfetch the doctor as early as possible the next morning, she had to wait\r\nuntil Grain-of-Salt had risen, for she did not know what doctor to call in.\r\nShe asked him.\r\n\r\nCertainly he knew of a good doctor! and a famous one, too! who made his\r\nrounds in a carriage, not on foot, like doctors of no account. Dr.\r\nCendrier, rue Rublet, near the Church; he was the man! To find the street\r\nshe had only to follow the railway tracks as far as the station.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke of such a great doctor who made his rounds in a carriage,\r\nPerrine was afraid that she would not have enough money to pay him, and\r\ntimidly she questioned Grain-of-Salt, not daring to ask outright what she\r\nwanted to know. Finally he understood.\r\n\r\n\"What you'd have to pay?\" he asked. \"It's a lot, but it won't be more than\r\nforty sous, and so as to make sure, you'll have to pay him in advance.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the directions that Grain-of-Salt gave her, she easily found the\r\nhouse, but the doctor had not yet risen, so she had to wait. She sat down\r\non a bench in the street, outside a stable door, behind which a coachman\r\nwas harnessing a horse to a carriage. She thought if she waited there she\r\nwould be sure to catch the doctor as he left the house, and if she gave him\r\nher forty sous he would consent to come. She was quite sure that he would\r\nnot if she had simply asked him to visit a patient who was staying in the\r\nGuillot Field.\r\n\r\nShe waited a long time; her suspense increased at the thought that her\r\nmother would be wondering what kept her away so long.\r\n\r\nAt last an old-fashioned carriage and a clumsy horse came out of the\r\nstables and stood before the doctor's house. Almost immediately the\r\ndoctor appeared, big, fat, with a grey beard.\r\n\r\nBefore he could step into his carriage Perrine was beside him. She put\r\nher question tremblingly.\r\n\r\n\"The Guillot Field?\" he said. \"Has there been a fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; it's my mother who is ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are photographers.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his foot on the step. She offered him her forty sous quickly.\r\n\r\n\"We can pay you,\" she hastened to say.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's sixty sous,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe added twenty sous more. He took the money and slipped it into his\r\nwaistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be with your mother in about fifteen minutes,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe ran all the way back, happy, to take the good news.\r\n\r\n\"He'll cure you, mama; he's a real, real doctor!\" she said,\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\nShe quickly busied herself with her mother, washing her hands and face\r\nand arranging her hair, which was beautiful, black and silky; then she\r\ntidied up the \"room,\" which only had the result of making it look\r\nemptier and poorer still.\r\n\r\nShe had not long to wait. Hearing the carriage in the road, she ran out\r\nto meet the doctor. As he was walking towards the house she pointed to\r\nthe wagon.\r\n\r\n\"We live there in our wagon,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem surprised; he was accustomed to the extreme poverty of\r\nhis patients; but Perrine, who was looking at him, noticed that he\r\nfrowned when he saw the sick woman lying on the mattress in the\r\nmiserable cart.\r\n\r\n\"Put out your tongue and give me your hand,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThose who pay forty or a hundred francs for a visit from a doctor have\r\nno idea of the brevity with which the poor people's cases are diagnosed.\r\nIn less than a minute his examination was made.\r\n\r\n\"A case for the hospital,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, little Perrine and her mother uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n\"Now, child, leave me alone with your mother,\" he said in a tone of\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Perrine hesitated, but at a sign from her mother she left\r\nthe wagon and stood just outside.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to die,\" said the woman in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Who says that? What you need is nursing, and you can't get that here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could I have my daughter at the hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"She can see you Thursdays and Sundays.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will become of her without me,\" murmured the mother, \"alone in\r\nParis? If I have to die I want to go holding her hand in mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway, you can't be left in this cart. The cold nights would be\r\nfatal for you. You must take a room. Can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is not for long, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grain-of-Salt can rent you one, and won't charge much; but the room is\r\nnot all. You must have medicine and good food and care, all of which you\r\nwould get at the hospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, that is impossible,\" said the sick woman. \"I cannot leave my\r\nlittle girl. What would become of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's as you like; it's your own affair. I have told you what I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can come in, little girl, now,\" he called out. Then taking a leaf\r\nfrom his note pad, he wrote out a prescription.\r\n\r\n\"Take that to the druggist, near the Church,\" he said, handing it to\r\nPerrine. \"No other, mind you. The packet marked _No. 1_ give to your\r\nmother. Then give her the potion every hour. Give her the Quinquina\r\nwine when she eats, for she must eat anything she wants, especially\r\neggs. I'll drop in again this evening.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran out after him.\r\n\r\n\"Is my mama very ill?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well ... try and get her to go to the hospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you cure her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, but I can't give her what she'll get at the hospital. It is\r\nfoolish for her not to go. She won't go because she has to leave you.\r\nNothing will happen to you, for you look like a girl who can take care\r\nof yourself.\"\r\n\r\nStriding on, he reached his carriage. Perrine wanted him to say more,\r\nbut he jumped in quickly and was driven off. She returned to the wagon.\r\n\r\n\"Go quickly to the druggist; then get some eggs. Take all the money; I\r\nmust get well,\" said the mother.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor said he could cure you,\" said Perrine. \"I'll go quickly for\r\nthe things.\"\r\n\r\nBut all the money she took was not enough. When the druggist had read\r\nthe prescription he looked at Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Have you the money to pay for this?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe opened her hand.\r\n\r\n\"This will come to seven francs, fifty,\" said the man who had already\r\nmade his calculation.\r\n\r\nShe counted what she had in her hand and found that she had six francs\r\neighty-five centimes, in counting the Austrian florin as two francs. She\r\nneeded thirteen sous more.\r\n\r\n\"I have only six francs eighty-five centimes. Would you take this\r\nflorin? I have counted that,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; I should say not!\" replied the man.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? She stood in the middle of the store with her hand\r\nopen. She was in despair.\r\n\r\n\"If you'll take the florin there will be only thirteen sous lacking,\"\r\nshe said at last, \"and I'll bring them this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nBut the druggist would not agree to this arrangement. He would neither\r\ngive her credit for thirteen sous nor accept the florin.\r\n\r\n\"As there is no hurry for the wine,\" he said, \"you can come and fetch it\r\nthis afternoon. I'll prepare the other things at once and they'll only\r\ncost you three francs fifty.\"\r\n\r\nWith the money that remained she bought some eggs, a little Vienna loaf\r\nwhich she thought might tempt her mother's appetite, and then she\r\nreturned to the Field, running as fast as she could all the way.\r\n\r\n\"The eggs are fresh,\" she said. \"I held them up to the light. And look\r\nat the bread! Isn't it a beautiful loaf, mama? You'll eat it, won't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, darling.\"\r\n\r\nBoth were full of hope. Perrine had absolute faith in the doctor, and\r\nwas certain that he would perform the miracle. Why should he deceive\r\nthem? When one asks the doctor to tell the truth, doesn't he do so?\r\n\r\nHope had given the sick woman an appetite. She had eaten nothing for\r\ntwo days; now she ate a half of the roll.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Perrine, gleefully.\r\n\r\n\"Everything will be all right soon,\" answered her mother with a smile.\r\n\r\nPerrine went to the house to inquire of Grain-of-Salt what steps she\r\nshould take to sell the wagon and dear Palikare.\r\n\r\nAs for the wagon, nothing was easier. Grain-of-Salt would buy it\r\nhimself; he bought everything, furniture, clothes, tools, musical\r\ninstruments ... but a donkey! That was another thing. He did not buy\r\nanimals, except pups, and his advice was that they should wait for a day\r\nand sell it at the Horse Market. That would be on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nWednesday seemed a long way off, for in her excitement, and filled with\r\nhope, Perrine had thought that by Wednesday her mother would be strong\r\nenough to start for Maraucourt. But to have to wait like this! There was\r\none thing, though: With what she got for the wagon she could buy the two\r\ndresses and the railway tickets, and if Grain-of-Salt paid them enough,\r\nthen they need not sell Palikare. He could stay at the Guillot Field and\r\nshe could send for him after they arrived at Maraucourt. Dear Palikare!\r\nHow contented he would be to have a beautiful stable to live in and go\r\nout every day in the green fields.\r\n\r\nBut alas! Grain-of-Salt would not give one sou over fifteen francs for\r\nthe wagon.\r\n\r\n\"Only fifteen francs!\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I am only doing that to oblige you. What do you think I can do\r\nwith it?\" he said. He struck the wheels and the shafts with an iron bar;\r\nthen shrugged his shoulders in disgust.\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of bargaining all she could get was two francs fifty\r\non the price he had offered, and the promise that he would not take it\r\nuntil after they had gone, so that they could stay in it all day, which\r\nshe thought would be much better for her mother than closed up in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAfter she had looked at the room that Grain-of-Salt was willing to rent,\r\nshe realized how much the wagon meant to them, for in spite of the pride\r\nin which he spoke of his \"Apartments,\" and the contempt in which he\r\nspoke of the wagon, Perrine was heartbroken at the thought that she must\r\nbring her dear mother to this dirty smelling house.\r\n\r\nAs she hesitated, wondering if her mother would not be poisoned from the\r\nodor which came from the heaps of things outside, Grain-of-Salt said\r\nimpatiently:\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up! The rag pickers will be here in a moment and I'll have to get\r\nbusy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the doctor know what these rooms are like?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure! He came to this one lots of times to see the Baroness.\"\r\n\r\nThat decided her. If the doctor had seen the rooms he knew what he was\r\ndoing in advising them to take one, and then if a Baroness lived in one,\r\nher mother could very well live in the other.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to pay one week in advance,\" said the landlord, \"and three\r\nsous for the donkey and six for the wagon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you've bought the wagon,\" she said in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but as you're using it, it's only fair that you should pay.\"\r\n\r\nShe had no reply to make to this. It was not the first time that she had\r\nbeen cheated. It had happened so often on their long journey.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the poor little girl.\r\n\r\nShe employed the greater part of the day in cleaning their room, washing\r\nthe floor, wiping down the walls, the ceiling, the windows. Such a\r\nscrubbing had never been seen in that house since the place had been\r\nbuilt!\r\n\r\nDuring the numerous trips that she made from the house to the pump she\r\nsaw that not only did grass and thistles grow in the Field, but there\r\nwere flowers. Evidently some neighbors had thrown some plants over the\r\nfence and the seeds had sprung up here and there. Scattered about she\r\nsaw a few roots of wall-flowers, pinks and even some violets!\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely idea! She would pick some and put them in their room. They\r\nwould drive away the bad odor, and at the same time make the place look\r\ngay.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the flowers belonged to no one, for Palikare was allowed\r\nto eat them if he wished, yet she was afraid to pick the tiniest one\r\nwithout first asking Grain-of-Salt.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to sell them?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, just to put a few in our room,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if that's it you may take as many as you like, but if you are going\r\nto sell them, I might do that myself. As it's for your room, help\r\nyourself, little one. You like the smell of flowers. I like the smell of\r\nwine. That's the only thing I can smell.\"\r\n\r\nShe picked the flowers, and searching amongst the heap of broken glass\r\nshe found an old vase and some tumblers.\r\n\r\nThe miserable room was soon filled with the sweet perfume of\r\nwall-flowers, pinks and violets, which kept out the bad odors of the\r\nrest of the house, and at the same time the fresh, bright colors lent a\r\nbeauty to the dark walls.\r\n\r\nWhile working, she had made the acquaintance of her neighbors. On one\r\nside of their room lived an old woman whose gray head was adorned with a\r\nbonnet decorated with the tri-color ribbon of the French flag. On the\r\nother side lived a big man, almost bent double. He wore a leather apron,\r\nso long and so large that it seemed to be his only garment. The woman\r\nwith the tri-color ribbons was a street singer, so the big man told her,\r\nand no less a person than the Baroness of whom Grain-of-Salt had spoken.\r\nEvery day she left the Guillot Field with a great red umbrella and a big\r\nstick which she stuck in the ground at the crossroads or at the end of a\r\nbridge. She would shelter herself from the sun or the rain under her red\r\numbrella and sing, and then sell to the passersby copies of the songs\r\nshe sang.\r\n\r\nAs to the big man with the apron, he was a cobbler, so she learned from\r\nthe Baroness, and he worked from morning to night. He was always silent,\r\nlike a fish, and for this reason everybody called him Father Carp. But\r\nalthough he did little talking he made enough noise with his hammer.\r\n\r\nAt sunset Perrine's room was ready. Her mother, as she was helped in,\r\nlooked at the flowers with surprise and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"How good you are to your mama, darling,\" she murmured as she clung to\r\nPerrine's arm.\r\n\r\n\"How good I am to myself,\" Perrine cried gayly, \"because if I do\r\nanything that pleases you, I am so happy.\"\r\n\r\nAt night they had to put the flowers outside. Then the odors of the old\r\nhouse rose up terribly strong, but the sick woman did not dare complain.\r\nWhat would be the use, for she could not leave the Guillot Field to go\r\nelsewhere?\r\n\r\nHer sleep was restless, and when the doctor came the next morning he\r\nfound her worse, which made him change the treatment, and Perrine was\r\nobliged to go again to the druggist. This time he asked five francs to\r\nfill out the prescription. She did not flinch, but paid bravely,\r\nalthough she could scarcely breathe when she got outside the store. If\r\nthe expenses continued to increase at this rate poor Palikare would have\r\nto be sold on Wednesday. He would have to go now anyway. And if the\r\ndoctor prescribed something else the next day, costing five francs or\r\nmore, where would she find the money?\r\n\r\nWhen, with her mother and father, she had tramped over the mountains,\r\nthey had often been hungry, and more than once since they had left\r\nGreece on their way to France they had been without food. But hunger in\r\nthe mountains and in the country was another thing--there was always the\r\nchance that they would find some wild fruit or vegetables. But in Paris\r\nthere was no hope for those who had no money in their pockets.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of them? And the terrible thing was that she must take\r\nthe responsibility. Her mother was too ill now to think or plan, and\r\nPerrine, although only a child, realized that she must now be the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning her fears were realized. After a brief examination,\r\nthe doctor took from his pocket that terrible notebook that Perrine\r\ndreaded to see and began to write. She had the courage to stop him.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, if the medicines which you are ordering are not all of the same\r\nimportance,\" she said, \"will you please write out those which are needed\r\nthe most?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked angrily.\r\n\r\nShe trembled but continued bravely:\r\n\r\n\"I mean that we have not much money today, and we shall not get any\r\nperhaps until tomorrow ... so....\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, then glanced round the room, as though for the first\r\ntime remarking their poverty; then he put his notebook back in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"We won't change the treatment until tomorrow, then,\" he said. \"There is\r\nno hurry for this. Continue the same today.\"\r\n\r\n\"No hurry!\" Perrine repeated the words to herself. There was no hurry\r\nthen ... her mother was not so ill as she had feared; they had just to\r\nwait and hope....\r\n\r\nWednesday was the day for which she was waiting, yet at the same time\r\nhow she dreaded it. Dear, dear Palikare.... Whenever her mother did not\r\nneed her she would run out into the field and kiss his nose and talk to\r\nhim, and as he had no work to do, and all the thistles to eat that he\r\nwanted and his little mistress' love, he was the happiest donkey in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if you only knew,\" murmured Perrine, as she caressed him.\r\n\r\nBut he did not know. All he knew was that she loved him and that the\r\nthistles were good. So, as she kissed and kissed, he brayed in\r\ncontentment and shook his long ears as he looked at her from the corner\r\nof his eyes.\r\n\r\nBesides, he had made friends with Grain-of-Salt and had received a proof\r\nof his friendship in a way that flattered his greed. On Monday, having\r\nbroken loose, he had trotted up to Grain-of-Salt, who was occupied in\r\nsorting out the rags and bones that had just arrived, and he stood\r\nbeside him. The man was about to pour out a drink from the bottle that\r\nwas always beside him when he saw Palikare, his eyes fixed on him, his\r\nneck stretched out.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked. As the words were not said in\r\nanger, the donkey knew, and he did not move.\r\n\r\n\"Want a drink ... a glass of wine?\" he asked mockingly. The glass that\r\nhe was about to put to his lips he offered in a joke to the donkey.\r\nPalikare, taking the offer seriously, came a step nearer and pushing out\r\nhis lips to make them as thin and as long as possible, drank a good half\r\nof the glass which had been filled to the brim.\r\n\r\n\"_Oh la la! la la!_\" cried Grain-of-Salt, bursting with laughter.\r\n\"Baroness! Carp! Come here!\"\r\n\r\nAt his calls, the Baroness and Carp, also a rag picker who came into the\r\nfield at that moment and a man with a push-cart who sold red and yellow\r\nand blue sugar sticks, ran up.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" demanded the Baroness.\r\n\r\nHe filled the glass again and held it out to the donkey, who, as before,\r\nabsorbed half of the contents amidst the laughter and shouts of those\r\nwho looked on.\r\n\r\n\"I heard that donkeys liked wine, but I never believed it,\" said the\r\ncandy man.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to buy him; he'd be a good companion for you,\" said the\r\nBaroness.\r\n\r\n\"A fine pair,\" said another.\r\n\r\nBut Grain-of-Salt did not buy him, although he took a great liking to\r\nhim, and told Perrine that he would go with her on Wednesday to the\r\nHorse Market. This was a great relief for Perrine, for she had wondered\r\nhow she would ever be able to find the place; neither did she know how\r\nto discuss prices, and she was very much afraid that she would be\r\nrobbed. She had heard so many stories about Paris thieves, and what\r\ncould she have done to protect herself?...\r\n\r\nWednesday morning came. At an early hour she busied herself with\r\nbrushing Palikare and making his beautiful coat shine so that he would\r\nlook his best. How she kissed him! How she stroked him while her tears\r\nfell!\r\n\r\nWhen Palikare saw that instead of being hitched to the wagon, a rope was\r\nput round his neck, his surprise was great; and still more surprised was\r\nhe when Grain-of-Salt, who did not want to walk all the way from\r\nCharonne to the Horse Market, climbed up on a chair and from the chair\r\nonto his back. But as Perrine held him and spoke to him, he offered no\r\nresistance. Besides, was not Grain-of-Salt his friend?\r\n\r\nThey started thus. Palikare, still surprised, walked gravely along, led\r\nby Perrine. On through the streets they went. At first they met but few\r\nvehicles, and soon they arrived at a bridge which jutted into a large\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\"That's the Zoo,\" said Grain-of-Salt, \"and I'm sure that they haven't\r\ngot a donkey there like yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps we can sell him to the Zoo,\" exclaimed Perrine, thinking\r\nthat in a zoological garden all the animals have to do is to walk about\r\nand be looked at. That would be very nice for dear Palikare!\r\n\r\n\"An affair with the Government,\" said Grain-of-Salt; \"better not, 'cause\r\nthe Government....\"\r\n\r\nFrom his expression it was evident that Grain-of-Salt had no faith in\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nFrom now on the traffic was intense. Perrine needed all her wits and\r\neyes about her. After what seemed a long time they arrived at the Market\r\nand Grain-of-Salt jumped off the donkey. But while he was getting down\r\nPalikare had time to gaze about him, and when Perrine tried to make him\r\ngo through the iron gate at the entrance he refused to budge.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to know by instinct that this was a market where horses and\r\ndonkeys were sold. He was afraid. Perrine coaxed him, commanded him,\r\nbegged him, but he still refused to move. Grain-of-Salt thought that if\r\nhe pushed him from behind he would go forward, but Palikare, who would\r\nnot permit such familiarity, backed and reared, dragging Perrine with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere was already a small circle of onlookers around them. In the first\r\nrow, as usual, there were messenger boys and errand boys, each giving\r\nhis word of advice as to what means to use to force the donkey through\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\n\"That there donkey is going to give some trouble to the fool who buys\r\nhim,\" cried one.\r\n\r\nThese were dangerous words that might affect the sale, so Grain-of-Salt\r\nthought he ought to say something.\r\n\r\n\"He's the cleverest donkey that ever was!\" he cried. \"He knows he's\r\ngoing to be sold, and he's doin' this 'cause he loves us and don't want\r\nter leave us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you so sure of that, Grain-of-Salt?\" called out a voice in the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\"Zooks! who knows my name here?\" cried the one addressed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you recognize La Rouquerie?\"\r\n\r\n\"My faith, that's so,\" he cried, as the speaker came forward. They shook\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"That donkey yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it belongs to this little gal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've had more than one glass together, and if you want a good donkey\r\nI'll speak for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need one and yet I don't need one,\" said La Rouquerie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, come and take a drink. 'Tain't worthwhile to pay for a place in\r\nthe Market....\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially if he won't budge!\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you he was a smart one; he's that intelligent.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I buy him it's not for his tricks nor 'cause he can take a drink\r\nwith one, but he must work.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can work, sure! He's come all the way from Greece without stopping.\"\r\n\r\n\"From Greece!\"\r\n\r\nGrain-of-Salt made a sign to Perrine to follow him, and Palikare, now\r\nthat he knew that he was not going into the market, trotted beside her\r\ndocilely. She did not even have to pull his rope.\r\n\r\nWho was this prospective buyer? A man? A woman? From the general\r\nappearance and the hairless face it might be a woman of about fifty, but\r\nfrom the clothes, which consisted of a workingman's blouse and trousers\r\nand a tall leather hat like a coachman wears, and from the short, black\r\npipe which the individual was smoking, it surely was a man. But whatever\r\nit was, Perrine decided that the person looked kind. The expression was\r\nnot hard or wicked.\r\n\r\nGrain-of-Salt and the stranger turned down a narrow street and stopped\r\nat a wine shop. They sat down at one of the tables outside on the\r\npavement and ordered a bottle of wine and two glasses. Perrine remained\r\nby the curb, still holding her donkey.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see if he isn't cunning,\" said Grain-of-Salt, holding out his\r\nfull glass.\r\n\r\nPalikare stretched out his neck, thinned his lips and quickly drank the\r\nhalf glass of wine.\r\n\r\nBut this feat did not give La Rouquerie any particular satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want him to drink my wine, but to drag my cart with the rabbit\r\nskins,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I just tell you that he came from Greece, draggin' a wagon the\r\nwhole way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's another thing!\"\r\n\r\nThe strange looking woman carefully examined the animal; then she gave\r\nthe greatest attention to every detail; then asked Perrine how much she\r\nwanted for him. The price which Perrine had arranged with her landlord\r\nbeforehand was one hundred francs. This was the sum that she asked.\r\n\r\nLa Rouquerie gave a cry of amazement. One hundred francs! Sell a donkey\r\nwithout any guarantee for that sum! Were they crazy? Then she began to\r\nfind all kind of faults with the unfortunate Palikare.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Grain-of-Salt, after a lengthy discussion; \"we'll\r\ntake him to the Market.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine breathed. The thought of only getting twenty francs had stunned\r\nher. In their terrible distress what would twenty francs be? A hundred\r\nfrancs even was not sufficient for their pressing needs.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see if he'll go in any more now than he did then,\" cried La\r\nRouquerie.\r\n\r\nPalikare followed Perrine up to the Market gates obediently, but once\r\nthere he stopped short. She insisted, and talked, and pulled at the\r\nrope, but it was no use. Finally he sat down in the middle of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\"Palikare, do come! Do come, dear Palikare,\" Perrine said, imploringly.\r\n\r\nBut he sat there as though he did not understand a word of what she was\r\nsaying. A crowd gathered round and began to jeer.\r\n\r\n\"Set fire to his tail,\" cried one.\r\n\r\nGrain-of-Salt was furious, Perrine in despair.\r\n\r\n\"You see he won't go in,\" cried La Rouquerie. \"I'll give thirty francs,\r\nthat's ten more'n I said, 'cause his cunning shows that this donkey is a\r\ngood boy, but hurry up and take the money or I'll buy another.\"\r\n\r\nGrain-of-Salt consulted Perrine with a glance; he made her a sign that\r\nshe ought to accept the offer. But she seemed stunned at such a fraud.\r\nShe was standing there undecided when a policeman told her roughly that\r\nshe was blocking up the street and that she must move on.\r\n\r\n\"Go forward, or go back, but don't stand there,\" he ordered.\r\n\r\nShe could not go forward, for Palikare had no intention of doing so. As\r\nsoon as he understood that she had given up all hope of getting him into\r\nthe Market, he got up and followed her docilely, agitating his long ears\r\nwith satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said La Rouquerie, after she had put thirty francs into poor\r\nPerrine's hand, \"you must take him to my place, for I'm beginning to\r\nknow him and he's quite capable of refusing to come with me. I don't\r\nlive far from here.\"\r\n\r\nBut Grain-of-Salt would not consent to do this; he declared that the\r\ndistance was too far for him.\r\n\r\n\"You go with the lady alone,\" he said to Perrine, \"and don't be too cut\r\nup about your donkey. He'll be all right with her. She's a good woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall I find my way back to Charonne?\" asked Perrine,\r\nbewildered. She dreaded to be lost in the great city.\r\n\r\n\"You follow the fortifications ... nothing easier.\"\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the street where La Rouquerie lived was not far from the\r\nHorse Market, and it did not take them long to get there. There were\r\nheaps of garbage before her place, just like in Guillot Field.\r\n\r\nThe moment of parting had come. As she tied Palikare up in a little\r\nstable, her tears fell on his head.\r\n\r\n\"Don't take on so,\" said the woman; \"I'll take care of him, I promise\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"We loved him so much,\" said little Perrine. Then she went on her way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\"POOR LITTLE GIRL\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was she to do with thirty francs when she had calculated that they\r\nmust at least have one hundred? She turned this question over in her\r\nmind sadly as she walked along by the fortifications. She found her way\r\nback easily. She put the money into her mother's hand, for she did not\r\nknow how to spend it. It was her mother who decided what to do.\r\n\r\n\"We must go at once to Maraucourt,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"But are you strong enough?\" Perrine asked doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I must be. We have waited too long in the hope that I should get\r\nbetter. And while we wait our money is going. What poor Palikare has\r\nbrought us will go also. I did not want to go in this miserable\r\nstate....\"\r\n\r\n\"When must we go? Today?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"No; it's too late today. We must go tomorrow morning. You go and find\r\nout the hours of the train and the price of the tickets. It is the Gare\r\ndu Nord station, and the place where we get out is Picquigny.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine anxiously sought Grain-of-Salt. He told her it was better for\r\nher to consult a time table than to go to the station, which was a long\r\nway off. From the time table they learned that there were two trains in\r\nthe morning, one at six o'clock and one at ten, and that the fare to\r\nPicquigny, third class, was nine francs twenty-five centimes.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take the ten o'clock train,\" said her mother, \"and we will take a\r\ncab, for I certainly cannot walk to the station.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet when nine o'clock the next day came she could not even get to\r\nthe cab that Perrine had waiting for her. She attempted the few steps\r\nfrom her room to the cab, but would have fallen to the ground had not\r\nPerrine held her.\r\n\r\n\"I must go back,\" she said weakly. \"Don't be anxious ... it will pass.\"\r\n\r\nBut it did not pass, and the Baroness, who was watching them depart, had\r\nto bring a chair. The moment she dropped into the seat she fainted.\r\n\r\n\"She must go back and lie down,\" said the Baroness, rubbing her cold\r\nhands. \"It is nothing, girl; don't look so scared ... just go and find\r\nCarp. The two of us can carry her to her room. You can't go ... not just\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baroness soon had the sick woman in her bed, where she regained\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\"Now you must just stay there in your bed,\" said the Baroness, kindly.\r\n\"You can go just as well tomorrow. I'll get Carp to give you a nice cup\r\nof bouillon. He loves soup as much as the landlord loves wine; winter\r\nand summer he gets up at five o'clock and makes his soup; good stuff it\r\nis, too. Few can make better.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, she went to Carp, who was again at his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Will you give me a cup of your bouillon for our patient?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe replied with a smile only, but he quickly took the lid from a\r\nsaucepan and filled a cup with the savory soup.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness returned with it, carrying it carefully, so as not to spill\r\na drop.\r\n\r\n\"Take that, my dear lady,\" she said, kneeling down beside the bed.\r\n\"Don't move, but just open your lips.\"\r\n\r\nA spoonful was put to the sick woman's lips, but she could not swallow\r\nit. Again she fainted, and this time she remained unconscious for a\r\nlonger time. The Baroness saw that the soup was not needed, and so as\r\nnot to waste it, she made Perrine take it.\r\n\r\nA day passed. The doctor came, but there was nothing he could do.\r\n\r\nPerrine was in despair. She wondered how long the thirty francs that La\r\nRouquerie had given her would last. Although their expenses were not\r\ngreat, there was first one thing, then another, that was needed. When\r\nthe last sous were spent, where would they go? What would become of them\r\nif they could get no more money?\r\n\r\nShe was seated beside her mother's bedside, her beautiful little face\r\nwhite and drawn with anxiety. Suddenly she felt her mother's hand,\r\nwhich she held in hers, clasp her fingers more tightly.\r\n\r\n\"You want something?\" she asked quickly, bending her head.\r\n\r\n\"I want to speak to you ... the hour has come for my last words to you,\r\ndarling,\" said her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mama! mama!\" cried Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Don't interrupt, darling, and let us both try to control ourselves. I\r\ndid not want to frighten you, and that is the reason why, until now, I\r\nhave said nothing that would add to your grief. But what I have to say\r\nmust be said, although it hurts us both. We are going to part....\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her efforts, Perrine could not keep back her sobs.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is terrible, dear child, and yet I am wondering if, after all,\r\nit is not for the best ... that you will be an orphan. It may be better\r\nfor you to go alone than to be taken to them by a mother whom they have\r\nscorned. Well, God's will is that you should be left alone ... in a few\r\nhours ... tomorrow, perhaps....\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she stopped, overcome with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"When I ... am gone ... there will be things for you to do. In my pocket\r\nyou will find a large envelope which contains my marriage certificate.\r\nThe certificate bears my name and your father's. You will be asked to\r\nshow it, but make them give it back to you. You might need it later on\r\nto prove your parentage. Take great care of it, dear. However, you\r\nmight lose it, so I want you to learn it by heart, so that you will\r\nnever forget it. Then, when a day comes and you need it, you must get\r\nanother copy. You understand? Remember all that I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mama; yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be very unhappy, but you must not give way to despair. When\r\nyou have nothing more to do in Paris ... when you are left alone ...\r\nthen you must go off at once to Maraucourt ... by train if you have\r\nenough money ... on foot, if you have not. Better to sleep by the\r\nroadside and have nothing to eat than to stay in Paris. You promise to\r\nleave Paris at once, Perrine?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise, mama,\" sobbed the little girl.\r\n\r\nThe sick woman made a sign that she wanted to say more, but that she\r\nmust rest for a moment. Little Perrine waited, her eyes fixed on her\r\nmother's face.\r\n\r\n\"You will go to Maraucourt?\" said the dying woman after a few moments\r\nhad passed. \"You have no right to claim anything ... what you get must\r\nbe for yourself alone ... be good, and make yourself loved. All is there\r\n... for you. I have hope ... you will be loved for yourself ... they\r\ncannot help loving you ... and then your troubles will be over, my\r\ndarling.\"\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands in prayer. Then a look of heavenly rapture came\r\nover her face.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" she cried; \"I see ... my darling will be loved! She will be\r\nhappy ... she will be cared for. I can die in peace now with this\r\nthought ... Perrine, my Perrine, keep a place in your heart for me\r\nalways, child....\"\r\n\r\nThese words, which seemed like an exaltation to Heaven, had exhausted\r\nher; she sank back on the mattress and sighed. Perrine waited ...\r\nwaited. Her mother did not speak. She was dead. Then the child left the\r\nbedside and went out of the house. In the field she threw herself down\r\non the grass and broke into sobs. It seemed as though her little heart\r\nwould break.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before she could calm herself. Then her breath came\r\nin hiccoughs. Vaguely she thought that she ought not to leave her mother\r\nalone. Someone should watch over her.\r\n\r\nThe field was now filled with shadows; the night was falling. She\r\nwandered about, not knowing where she went, still sobbing.\r\n\r\nShe passed the wagon for the tenth time. The candy man, who had watched\r\nher come out of the house, went towards her with two sugar sticks in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little girl,\" he said, pityingly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!...\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"There, there! Take these,\" he said, offering her the candy. \"Sweetness\r\nis good for sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA HARD ROAD TO TRAVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last prayers had been uttered. Perrine still stood before the grave.\r\nThe Baroness, who had not left her, gently took her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" she said; \"you must come away,\" she added more firmly as Perrine\r\nattempted to resist her.\r\n\r\nHolding her tightly by the arm, she drew her away. They walked on for\r\nsome moments, Perrine not knowing what was passing around her, nor\r\nunderstanding where they were leading her. Her thoughts, her spirit, her\r\nheart, were with her mother.\r\n\r\nAt last they stopped in one of the side paths; then she saw standing\r\nround her the Baroness, who had now let go of her arm, Grain-of-Salt and\r\nthe candy man, but she saw them only vaguely. The Baroness had black\r\nribbons on her bonnet; Grain-of-Salt was dressed like a gentleman and\r\nwore a high silk hat; Carp had replaced his leather apron by a black\r\nPrince Albert which came down to his feet, and the candy man had cast\r\naside his white blouse for a cloth coat. For, like the real Parisian who\r\npractises the cult of the dead, they had dressed themselves up in their\r\nbest to pay respect to the one they had just buried.\r\n\r\n\"I want to tell you, little one,\" commenced Grain-of-Salt, who thought\r\nthat he should speak first, being the most important person present; \"I\r\nwant to tell you that you can stay as long as you like in Guillot Fields\r\nwithout paying.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'd like to sing with me,\" said the Baroness, \"you can earn enough\r\nto live on. It's a nice profession.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'd like to go into the candy business, I'll teach you; that's a\r\nreal trade and a nice one,\" said the candy man.\r\n\r\nCarp said nothing, but with a smile and a gesture he let her understand\r\nthat she could always find a bowl of soup at his place ... and good\r\nsoup, too!\r\n\r\nPerrine's eyes filled with fresh tears, soft tears which washed away the\r\nbitterness of the burning ones which for two days had flowed from her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"How good you all are to me,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"One does what one can,\" said Grain-of-Salt.\r\n\r\n\"One should not leave an honest little girl like you on the streets of\r\nParis,\" said the Baroness.\r\n\r\n\"I must not stay in Paris,\" replied Perrine; \"I must go at once to my\r\nrelations.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have relations?\" exclaimed Grain-of-Salt, looking at the others\r\nwith an air which said that he did not think that those relations could\r\nbe worth much. \"Where are your relations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near Amiens.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how can you go to Amiens? Have you got money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not enough to take the train, but I'm going to walk there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a map in my pocket....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but does that tell you which road you have to take from here, here\r\nin Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but if you will tell me....\"\r\n\r\nThey all were eager to give her this information, but it was all so\r\nconfused and contradictory that Grain-of-Salt cut the talk short.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to lose yourself in Paris, just listen to what they are\r\nsaying,\" he said. \"Now, this is the way you must go,\" and he explained\r\nto her which road she should take. \"Now, when do you want to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"At once; I promised my mother,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"You must obey her,\" said the Baroness, solemnly, \"but not before I've\r\nkissed you; you're a good girl.\"\r\n\r\nThe men shook hands with her.\r\n\r\nShe knew she must leave the cemetery, yet she hesitated and turned once\r\nmore towards the grave that she had just left, but the Baroness stopped\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"As you are obliged to go, go at once; it is best,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, go,\" said Grain-of-Salt.\r\n\r\nWhen she had climbed into the car on the belt line she took an old map\r\nof France from her pocket which she had consulted many times alone since\r\nthey left Italy. From Paris to Amiens the road was easy; she had only to\r\ntake the Calais road; this was indicated on her map by a little black\r\nline. From Amiens she would go to Boulogne, and as she had learned also\r\nto calculate distances, she thought that to Maraucourt it ought to be\r\nabout one hundred and fifty-eight miles.\r\n\r\nBut could she do all those miles, regularly ... go on day after day? She\r\nknew that to walk four or five miles by chance on one day was a very\r\ndifferent matter to taking a long, continuous journey like she was\r\ncontemplating. There would be bad days ... rainy days ... and how long\r\nwould her money last? She had only five francs thirty-five centimes\r\nleft. The train pulled up at the station at which she had to get out.\r\nNow she had to turn to the right, and as the sun would not go down for\r\ntwo or three hours she hoped to be far away from Paris by night, and\r\nfind a place in the open country where she could sleep.\r\n\r\nYet as far as her eyes could see there was nothing but houses and\r\nfactories, factories with great tall chimneys sending forth clouds of\r\nthick, black smoke, and all along the road wagons, tramways and carts.\r\nAgain she saw a lot of trucks bearing the name that she had noticed\r\nwhile waiting to pass through the Gates: \"Maraucourt Factories, Vulfran\r\nPaindavoine.\"\r\n\r\nWould Paris ever end? Would she ever get out of this great city? She was\r\nnot afraid of the lonely fields, nor the silence of the country at\r\nnight, nor the mysterious shadows, but of Paris, the crowd, the lights.\r\nShe was now on the outskirts of the city. Before leaving it (although\r\nshe had no appetite), she thought she would buy a piece of bread so\r\nthat she would have something to eat before going to sleep. She went\r\ninto a baker shop.\r\n\r\n\"I want some bread, please,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any money?\" demanded the woman, who did not seem to put much\r\nconfidence in Perrine's appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I want one pound, please. Here is five francs. Will you give\r\nme the change?\"\r\n\r\nBefore cutting the bread the woman took up the five franc piece and\r\nexamined it.\r\n\r\n\"What! that!\" she exclaimed, making it ring on the marble slab.\r\n\r\n\"It's a five franc piece,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you to try and pass that off on me?\" asked the woman, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"No one, and I am asking you for a pound of bread for my supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you won't get any bread, and you'd better get out of here\r\nas quickly as you can before I have you arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrested! Why?\" she stammered in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Because you're a thief!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!...\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to pass counterfeit money on me. You vagabond ... you thief!\r\nBe off! No, wait; I'll get a policeman.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine knew that she was not a thief, whether the money was real or\r\nfalse, but vagabond she was. She had no home, no parents. What would she\r\nanswer the policeman? They would arrest her for being a vagabond.\r\n\r\nShe put this question to herself very quickly, but although her fear was\r\ngreat, she thought of her money.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't wish to sell me the bread, at least you can give me back\r\nmy money,\" she said, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"So that you can pass it on someone else, eh? I'll keep your money. If\r\nyou want it, go and fetch the police,\" cried the woman, furiously. \"Be\r\noff, you thief.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman's loud cries could be heard in the street, and several people\r\nby now had gathered round the door.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" someone cried.\r\n\r\n\"Why, this girl here is trying to rob my till,\" shouted the woman.\r\n\"There never is a cop when one wants one.\"\r\n\r\nTerrified, Perrine wondered how she could get out, but they let her pass\r\nas she made for the door, hissing her and calling her names as she ran.\r\nShe ran on and on, too afraid to turn round to see if anyone was\r\nfollowing her.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, which to her seemed hours, she found herself in the\r\ncountry, and was able to stop and breathe. No one was calling after her;\r\nno one following her.\r\n\r\nAfter her fears had calmed down she realized that she had nothing to eat\r\nand no money. What should she do? Instinctively she glanced at the\r\nfields by the wayside. She saw beets, onions, cabbages, but there was\r\nnothing there ready to eat, and besides, even if there had been ripe\r\nmelons and trees laden with fruit, what good would they have been to\r\nher; she could not stretch out her hand to pick the fruit any more than\r\nshe could stretch it out to beg of the passersby. No, little Perrine was\r\nnot a thief, nor a beggar, nor a vagabond.\r\n\r\nShe felt very depressed. It was eventide, and in the quietness of the\r\ntwilight she realized how utterly alone she was; but she knew that she\r\nmust not give way; she felt that while there was still light she must\r\nwalk on, and by the time night fell perhaps she would have found a spot\r\nwhere she could sleep in safety.\r\n\r\nShe had not gone far before she found what she thought would be the very\r\nplace. As she came to a field of artichokes she saw a man and woman\r\npicking artichoke heads and packing them in baskets, which they piled up\r\nin a cart that stood by the roadside. She stopped to look at them at\r\ntheir work. A moment later another cart driven by a girl came up.\r\n\r\n\"So you're getting yours all in?\" called out the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Should say so, and it's none too soon,\" replied the man. \"It's no fun\r\nsleeping here all night to watch for those rogues. I at least shall\r\nsleep in my bed tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about Monneau's lot?\" grinned the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Monneau's a sly dog,\" answered the man; \"he counts on us others\r\nwatching out for his. He's not going to be here tonight. Serve him\r\nright if he finds all his gone!\"\r\n\r\nAll three laughed heartily. They were not over-anxious that Monneau\r\nshould prosper. Didn't he profit by their watch to take his own slumbers\r\nin peace?\r\n\r\n\"That'll be a joke, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait for me,\" said the girl. \"I won't be a jiffy; then we'll go\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe man and the woman waited, and in a few minutes the girl had finished\r\nher task and the two carts, laden with artichokes, went towards the\r\nvillage. Perrine stood in the deserted road looking at the two fields,\r\nwhich presented such a difference in appearance. One was completely\r\nstripped of its vegetables; the other was filled with a splendid crop.\r\nAt the end of the field was a little hut made of branches where the man\r\nwho watched the field had slept. Perrine decided that she would stay\r\nthere for the night, now that she knew it would not be occupied by the\r\nwatch. She did not fear that she would be disturbed, yet she dared not\r\ntake possession of the place until it was quite dark. She sat down by a\r\nditch and waited, thankful that she had found what she wanted. Then at\r\nlast, when it was quite dark and all was quiet, she picked her way\r\ncarefully over the beds of artichokes and slipped into the hut. It was\r\nbetter inside than she had hoped, for the ground was covered with straw\r\nand there was a wooden box that would serve her for a pillow.\r\n\r\nEver since she had run from the baker's shop it had seemed to her that\r\nshe was like a tracked animal, and more than once she had looked behind\r\nher with fear, half expecting to see the police on her heels.\r\n\r\nShe felt now in the hut that she was safe. Her nerves relaxed. After a\r\nfew minutes she realized that she had another cause for anxiety. She was\r\nhungry, very hungry. While she was tramping along the roads, overwhelmed\r\nby her great loss, it had seemed to her that she would never want to eat\r\nor drink again. She felt the pangs of hunger now and she had only one\r\nsou left. How could she live on one sou for five or six days? This was a\r\nvery serious question. But then, had she not found shelter for the\r\nnight; perhaps she would find food for the morrow.\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, her long black lashes heavy with tears. The last\r\nthing at night she had always thought of her dead father; now it was the\r\nspirits of both her father and her mother that seemed to hover around\r\nher. Again and again she stretched out her arms in the darkness to them,\r\nand then, worn out with fatigue, with a sob she dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut although she was tired out, her slumbers were broken. She turned and\r\ntossed on the straw. Every now and again the rumbling of a cart on the\r\nroad would wake her, and sometimes some mysterious noise, which in the\r\nsilence of the night made her heart beat quickly. Then it seemed to her\r\nthat she heard a cart stop near the hut on the road. She raised herself\r\non her elbow to listen.\r\n\r\nShe had not made a mistake; she heard some whispering. She sprang to her\r\nfeet and looked through the cracks of the hut. A cart had stopped at the\r\nend of the field, and by the pale light from the stars she could dimly\r\nsee the form of a man or woman throwing out baskets to two others, who\r\ncarried them into the field. This was Monneau's lot. What did it mean at\r\nsuch an hour? Had Monneau come so late to cut his artichokes?\r\n\r\nThen she understood! These were the thieves! They had come to strip\r\nMonneau's field! They quickly cut the artichoke heads and heaped them up\r\nin the baskets. The woman had taken the cart away; evidently they did\r\nnot want it to stay on the road while they worked for fear of attracting\r\nthe attention of anyone passing by.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen to her if the thieves saw her? She had heard that\r\nthieves sometimes killed a person who caught them at their work. There\r\nwas the chance that they would not discover her. For they certainly knew\r\nthat the hut would not be occupied on this night that they had planned\r\nto strip the field. But if they caught her? And then ... if they were\r\narrested, she would be taken with them!\r\n\r\nAt this thought cold beads of perspiration broke out on her forehead.\r\nThieves work quickly; they would soon have finished!\r\n\r\nBut presently they were disturbed. From the distance could be heard the\r\nnoise of a cart on the paved road. As it drew nearer they hid\r\nthemselves, lying down flat between the artichoke beds.\r\n\r\nThe cart passed. Then they went on with their work even more quickly. In\r\nspite of their feverish haste it seemed to little Perrine that they\r\nwould never be finished. Every moment she feared that someone would come\r\nand catch them and she be arrested with them.\r\n\r\nIf she could only get away. She looked about her to see if it were\r\npossible for her to leave the hut. This could easily be done, but then\r\nthey would be sure to see her once she was on the road. It would be\r\nbetter to remain where she was.\r\n\r\nShe lay down again and pretended to sleep. As it was impossible for her\r\nto go out without being seen, it was wiser to pretend that she had not\r\nseen anything if they should come into the hut.\r\n\r\nFor some time they went on cutting the artichokes. Then there was\r\nanother noise on the road. It was their cart coming back. It stopped at\r\nthe end of the field. In a few minutes the baskets were all stowed in\r\nthe cart and the thieves jumped in and drove off hurriedly in the\r\ndirection of Paris.\r\n\r\nIf she had known the hour she could have slept until dawn, but not\r\nknowing how long she had been there, she thought that it would be better\r\nif she went on her way. In the country people are about at an early\r\nhour. If, when day broke, the laborers going to work saw her coming out\r\nof the hut, or even if they saw her round about the field, they might\r\nsuspect her of having been with the thieves and arrest her.\r\n\r\nSo she slipped out of the hut, ears on the alert for the slightest\r\nnoise, eyes glancing in every direction.\r\n\r\nShe reached the main road, then hurried off. The stars in the skies\r\nabove were disappearing, and from the east a faint streak of light lit\r\nthe shadows of the night and announced the approach of day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSTORMS AND FEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had not walked far before she saw in the distance a black mass\r\nsilhouetted against the dawning light to the grey sky. Chimneys, houses\r\nand steeples rose up in the coming dawn, leaving the rest of the\r\nlandscape obscure in the shadows.\r\n\r\nShe reached the first straggling cottages of the village. Instinctively\r\nshe trod more softly on the paved road. This was a useless precaution,\r\nfor with the exception of the cats which ran about the streets, everyone\r\nslept, and her little footsteps only awoke a few dogs who barked at her\r\nbehind closed gates.\r\n\r\nShe was famished; she was weak and faint with hunger.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of her if she dropped unconscious? She was afraid she\r\nmight soon. So that this would not happen, she thought it better to rest\r\na minute, and as she was now passing before a barn full of hay, she went\r\nin quietly and threw herself down on the soft bed. The rest, the warmth,\r\nand also the sweet smell of the hay, soothed her and soon she slept.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke the sun was already high in the heavens and was casting\r\nits rays over the fields where men and women were busily at work.\r\n\r\nThe pangs of hunger were now more acute than ever. Her head whirled; she\r\nwas so giddy that she could scarcely see where she went as she staggered\r\non. She had just reached the top of a hill, and before her, close by,\r\nwas the village with its shops. She would spend her last sou for a piece\r\nof bread! She had heard of people finding money on the road; perhaps she\r\nwould find a coin tomorrow; anyhow, she must have a piece of bread now.\r\n\r\nShe looked carefully at the last sou she possessed. Poor little girl,\r\nshe did not know the difference between real money and false, and\r\nalthough she thought this sou looked real, she was very nervous when she\r\nentered the first baker shop that she came across.\r\n\r\n\"Will you cut me a sou's worth of bread?\" she asked, timidly.\r\n\r\nThe man behind the counter took from the basket a little penny roll and\r\nhanded it to her. Instead of stretching out her hand, she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"If you'll cut a piece for me,\" she said, \"it doesn't matter if it is\r\nnot today's bread.\"\r\n\r\nThe baker gave her a large piece of bread that had been on the counter\r\nfor two or three days.\r\n\r\nWhat did that matter? The great thing was that it was larger than the\r\nlittle penny roll. It was worth two rolls.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was in her hand her mouth filled with water. But she would\r\nnot eat it until she had got out of the village. This she did very\r\nquickly. As soon as she had passed the last house, she took her little\r\nknife from her pocket and made a cross on the piece of bread so as to be\r\nable to cut it into four equal parts. She took one piece, keeping the\r\nthree others for the three following days, hoping that it might last her\r\nuntil she reached Amiens.\r\n\r\nShe had calculated this as she had hurried through the village, and it\r\nhad seemed such an easy matter. But scarcely had she swallowed a\r\nmouthful of her little piece of bread than she felt that the strongest\r\narguments had no power against hunger. She was famished! She must eat!\r\nThe second piece followed the first, the third followed the second.\r\nNever had her will power been so weak. She was hungry; she must have it\r\n... all ... all. Her only excuse was that the pieces were so tiny. When\r\nall four were put together, the whole only weighed a half a pound. And a\r\nwhole pound would not have been enough for her in her ravenous\r\ncondition. The day before she had only had a little cup of soup that\r\nCarp had given her. She devoured the fourth piece.\r\n\r\nShe went on her way. Although she had only just eaten her piece of\r\nbread, a terrible thought obsessed her. Where would she next get a\r\nmouthful? She now knew what torture she would have to go through ... the\r\npangs of hunger were terrible to endure. Where should she get her next\r\nmeal? She walked through two more villages. She was getting thirsty now,\r\nvery thirsty. Her tongue was dry, her lips parched. She came to the\r\nlast house in the village, but she did not dare ask for a glass of\r\nwater. She had noticed that the people looked at her curiously, and even\r\nthe dogs seemed to show their teeth at the ragged picture she presented.\r\n\r\nShe must walk on. The sun was very hot now, and her thirst became more\r\nintense as she tramped along the white road. There was not a tree along\r\nthe road, and little clouds of dust rose around her every instant,\r\nmaking her lips more parched. Oh, for a drink of water! The palate of\r\nher mouth seemed hard, like a corn.\r\n\r\nThe fact that she was thirsty had not worried her at first. One did not\r\nhave to go into a shop to buy water. Anybody could have it. When she saw\r\na brook or a river she had only to make a cup of her hands and drink all\r\nshe wanted. But she had walked miles in the dust and could see no sign\r\nof water. At last she picked up some little round stones and put them in\r\nher mouth. Her tongue seemed to be moister while she kept them there.\r\nShe changed them from time to time, hoping that she would soon come to a\r\nbrook.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the atmosphere changed, and although the heat was still\r\nsuffocating, the sun was hidden. Thick black clouds filled the sky. A\r\nstorm was coming on, there would be rain, and she would be able to hold\r\nher mouth up to it, or she could stoop down to the puddles that it made\r\nand drink!\r\n\r\nThe wind came up. A terrific swirl, carrying clouds of dust and leaves,\r\nswept over the country and battered down the crops, uprooting plants and\r\nshrubs in its mad fracas. Perrine could not withstand this whirlwind. As\r\nshe was lifted off her feet, a deafening crash of thunder shook the\r\nearth. Throwing herself down in the ditch, she laid flat on her stomach,\r\ncovering her mouth and her eyes with her two small hands. The thunder\r\nrolled heavily on.\r\n\r\nA moment ago she had been mad with thirst and had prayed that the storm\r\nwould break quickly; now she realized that the storm would not only\r\nbring thunder and rain, but lightning--terrible flashes of lightning\r\nthat almost blinded her.\r\n\r\nAnd there would be torrents of rain and hail! Where could she go? Her\r\ndress would be soaked, and how could she dry it?\r\n\r\nShe clambered out of the ditch. In the distance she saw a wood. She\r\nthought that she might find a nook there where she could take shelter.\r\n\r\nShe had no time to lose. It was very dark. The claps of thunder became\r\nmore frequent and louder, and the vivid lightning played fantastically\r\non the black sky.\r\n\r\nWould she be able to reach the wood before the storm broke? She ran as\r\nquickly as her panting breath would allow, now and again casting a look\r\nbehind her at the black clouds which seemed to be sweeping down upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had seen terrible storms in the mountains when travelling with her\r\nfather and mother, but they were with her then; now she was alone. Not\r\na soul near her in this desolate country. Fortunately the wind was\r\nbehind her; it blew her along, at times carrying her off her feet. If\r\nshe could only keep up this pace; the storm had not caught up with her\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nHolding her elbows against her little body and bending forward, she ran\r\non ... but the storm also made greater strides.\r\n\r\nAt this moment came a crash, louder and heavier. The storm was just over\r\nher now and the ground around her was cleaved with blue flames. It was\r\nbetter to stop running now; far better be drenched than struck down by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nSoon a few drops of rain fell. Fortunately she was nearing the wood, and\r\nnow she could distinguish clearly the great trees. A little more\r\ncourage. Many times her father had told her that if one kept one's\r\ncourage in times of danger one stood a better chance of being saved. She\r\nkept on.\r\n\r\nWhen at last she entered the forest it was all so black and dark she\r\ncould scarcely make out anything. Then suddenly a flash of lightning\r\ndazzled her, and in the vivid glare she thought she saw a little cabin\r\nnot far away to which led a bad road hollowed with deep ruts. Again the\r\nlightning flashed across the darkness, and she saw that she had not made\r\na mistake. About fifty steps farther on there was a little hut made of\r\nfaggots, that the woodcutters had built.\r\n\r\nShe made a final dash; then, at the end of her strength, worn out and\r\nbreathless, she sank down on the underbrush that covered the floor.\r\n\r\nShe had not regained her breath when a terrible noise filled the forest.\r\nThe crash, mingled with the splintering of wood, was so terrific that\r\nshe thought her end had come. The trees bent their trunks, twisting and\r\nwrithing, and the dead branches fell everywhere with a dull, crackling\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nCould her hut withstand this fury? She crawled to the opening. She had\r\nno time to think--a blue flame, followed by a frightful crash, threw her\r\nover, blinded and dazed. When she came to herself, astonished to find\r\nthat she was still alive, she looked out and saw that a giant oak that\r\nstood near the hut had been struck by lightning. In falling its length\r\nthe trunk had been stripped of its bark from top to bottom, and two of\r\nthe biggest branches were twisted round its roots.\r\n\r\nShe crept back, trembling, terrified at the thought that Death had been\r\nso near her, so near that its terrible breath had laid her low. As she\r\nstood there, pale and shaking, she heard an extraordinary rolling sound,\r\nmore powerful than that of an express train. It was the rain and the\r\nhail which was beating down on the forest. The cabin cracked from top to\r\nbottom; the roof bent under the fury of the tempest, but it did not fall\r\nin. No house, however solid, could be to her what this little hut was at\r\nthis moment, and she was mistress of it.\r\n\r\nShe grew calm; she would wait here until the storm had passed. A sense\r\nof well-being stole over her, and although the thunder continued to\r\nrumble and the rain came down in a deluge, and the wind whistled through\r\nthe trees, and the unchained tempest went on its mad way through the air\r\nand on the earth, she felt safe in her little hut. Then she made a\r\npillow for her head from the underbrush, and stretching herself out, she\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke the thunder had stopped, but the rain was still falling\r\nin a fine drizzle. The forest, with its solitude and silence, did not\r\nterrify her. She was refreshed from her long sleep and she liked her\r\nlittle cabin so much that she thought she would spend the night there.\r\nShe at least had a roof over her head and a dry bed.\r\n\r\nShe did not know how long she had slept, but that did not matter; she\r\nwould know when night came.\r\n\r\nShe had not washed herself since she had left Paris, and the dust which\r\nhad covered her from head to foot made her skin smart. Now she was\r\nalone, and there was plenty of water in the ditch outside and she would\r\nprofit by it.\r\n\r\nIn her pocket she had, beside her map and her mother's certificate, a\r\nfew little things tied up in a rag. There was a piece of soap, a small\r\ncomb, a thimble, and a spool of thread, in which she had stuck two\r\nneedles. She undid her packet; then taking off her vest, her shoes, and\r\nher stockings, she leaned over the ditch, in which the water flowed\r\nclear, and soaped her face, shoulders and feet. For a towel she had only\r\nthe rag she had used to tie up her belongings, and it was neither big\r\nnor thick, but it was better than nothing.\r\n\r\nThis _toilette_ did her almost as much good as her sleep. She combed her\r\ngolden hair in two big braids and let them hang over her shoulders. If\r\nit were not for the little pain in her stomach, and the few torn places\r\nin her shoes, which had been the cause of her sore feet, she would have\r\nbeen quite at ease in mind and body.\r\n\r\nShe was hungry, but there was nothing she could do. She could not find a\r\nbit of nourishment in this cabin, and as it was still raining, she felt\r\nthat she ought not to leave this shelter until the next day.\r\n\r\nThen when night came her hunger became more intense, till finally she\r\nbegan to cut some twigs and nibble on them, but they were hard and\r\nbitter, and after chewing on them for a few minutes she threw them away.\r\nShe tried the leaves; they went down easier.\r\n\r\nWhile she ate her meal and darned her stockings, night came on. Soon all\r\nwas dark and silent. She could hear no other sound than that of the\r\nraindrops falling from the branches.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had made up her mind to spend the night there, she\r\nexperienced a feeling of fright at being all alone in this black forest.\r\nTrue, she had spent a part of the day in the same place, running no\r\nother danger than that of being struck, but the woods in the daytime are\r\nnot like the woods at night, with the solemn silence and the mysterious\r\nshadows, which make one conjure up the vision of so many weird things.\r\n\r\nWhat was in the woods? she wondered. Wolves, perhaps!\r\n\r\nAt this thought she became wide awake, and jumping up, she found a big\r\nstick, which she cut to a point with her knife; then she strewed\r\nbranches and fagots all around her, piling them high. She could at least\r\ndefend herself behind her rampart.\r\n\r\nReassured, she laid down again, and it was not long before she was\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThe song of a bird awoke her. She recognized at once the sweet, shrill\r\nnotes of a blackbird. Day was breaking. She began to shake, for she was\r\nchilled to the bone. The dampness of the night had made her clothes as\r\nwet as though she had been through a shower.\r\n\r\nShe jumped to her feet and shook herself violently like a dog. She felt\r\nthat she ought to move about, but she did not want to go on her way yet,\r\nfor it was not yet light enough for her to study the sky to see if it\r\nwere going to rain again. To pass the time, and still more with the wish\r\nto be on the move, she arranged the fagots which she had disturbed the\r\nnight before. Then she combed her hair and washed herself in the ditch,\r\nwhich was full of water.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished the sun had risen, and the sky gleamed blue\r\nthrough the branches of the trees. There was not the slightest cloud to\r\nbe seen. She must go.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had darned her stockings well which had worn away through\r\nthe holes in her shoes, the continual tramp, tramp, tramp, made her\r\nlittle feet ache. After a time, however, she stepped out with a regular\r\nstep on the road, which had been softened by the rain, and the rays from\r\nthe beautiful sun fell upon her back and warmed her.\r\n\r\nNever had she seen such a lovely morning. The storm, which had washed\r\nthe roads and the fields, had given new life to the plants. Surely this\r\nwas a good omen. She was full of hope.\r\n\r\nHer imagination began to soar on wings. She hoped that somebody had had\r\na hole in their pockets and had lost some money, and that she could find\r\nit on the road. She hoped she might find something, not a purse full,\r\nbecause she would have to try to find the owner, but just a little coin,\r\none penny, or perhaps ten cents. She even thought that she might find\r\nsome work to do, something that could bring her in a few cents.\r\n\r\nShe needed so little to be able to live for three or four days.\r\n\r\nShe trudged along with her eyes fixed on the ground, but neither a\r\ncopper nor a silver coin did she see, and neither did she meet anybody\r\nwho could give her work.\r\n\r\nOh, for something to eat! She was famished. Again and again she had to\r\nsit down by the wayside, she was so weak from lack of food.\r\n\r\nShe wondered if she found nothing would she have to sit down by the road\r\nand die.\r\n\r\nFinally she came to a field and saw four young girls picking peas. A\r\npeasant woman seemed to be in charge.\r\n\r\nGathering courage, she crossed over the road and walked towards the\r\nwoman. But the woman stopped her before she could reach her.\r\n\r\n\"What cher want?\" she shouted.\r\n\r\n\"I want to know if I can help, too,\" answered Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want no one!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can give me just what you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where d'ye come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Paris.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the girls raised her head and cast her an angry look.\r\n\r\n\"The galavanter!\" she cried, \"she comes from Paris to try to get our\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told yer we don't want nobody,\" said the woman again.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but to go on her way, which she did with a heavy\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Look out! A cop's comin'!\" cried one of the girls.\r\n\r\nPerrine turned her head quickly, and they all burst out laughing, amused\r\nat the joke.\r\n\r\nShe had not gone far before she had to stop. She could not see the road\r\nfor the tears which filled her eyes. What had she done to those girls\r\nthat they should be so mean to her?\r\n\r\nEvidently it was as difficult for tramps to get work as it was for them\r\nto find pennies. She did not dare ask again for a job. She dragged her\r\nfeet along, only hurrying when she was passing through the villages so\r\nthat she could escape the stares.\r\n\r\nShe was almost prostrated when she reached a wood. It was mid-day and\r\nthe sun was scorching; there was not a breath of air. She was exhausted\r\nand dripping with perspiration. Then her heart seemed to stop and she\r\nfell to the ground, unable to move or think.\r\n\r\nA wagon coming up behind her passed by.\r\n\r\n\"This heat'll kill one,\" shouted the driver.\r\n\r\nIn a half conscious state she caught his words. They came to her like in\r\na dream; it was as though sentence had been passed upon her.\r\n\r\nSo she was to die? She had thought so herself, but now a messenger of\r\nDeath was saying so.\r\n\r\nWell, she would die. She could keep up no longer. Her father was dead,\r\nand her mother was dead, now she was going to die. A cruel thought\r\nflitted through her dull brain. She wondered why she could not have died\r\nwith them rather than in a ditch like a poor animal.\r\n\r\nShe tried to make a last effort to get to the wood where she could find\r\na spot to lie down for her last sleep, somewhere away from the road. She\r\nmanaged to drag herself into the wood, and there she found a little\r\ngrassy spot where violets were growing. She laid down under a large\r\ntree, her head on her arm, just as she did at night when she went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething warm passing over her face made her open her eyes. Dimly she\r\nsaw a large velvety head bending over her. In terror she tried to throw\r\nherself on one side, but a big tongue licked her cheek and held her to\r\nthe grass. So quickly had this happened that she had not had time to\r\nrecognize the big velvety head which belonged to a donkey, but while the\r\ngreat tongue continued to lick her face and hands she was able to look\r\nup at it.\r\n\r\nPalikare! It was dear, dear Palikare! She threw her arms around her\r\ndonkey's neck and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"My darling, dear, darling Palikare,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard his name he stopped licking her and lifting his head he\r\nsent forth five or six triumphant brays of happiness. Then, as though\r\nthat was not enough to express his contentment, he let out five or six\r\nmore, but not quite so loud.\r\n\r\nPerrine then noticed that he was without a harness or a rope.\r\n\r\nWhile she stroked him with her hand and he bent his long ears down to\r\nher, she heard a hoarse voice calling:\r\n\r\n\"What yer found, old chap? I'll be there in a minute. I'm comin', old\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOMETHING WARM PASSING OVER HER FACE MADE HER OPEN HER\r\nEYES.]\r\n\r\nThere was a quick step on the road, and Perrine saw what appeared to be\r\na man dressed in a smock and wearing a leather hat and with a pipe in\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, kid, what yer doin' with my donkey?\" he cried, without taking the\r\npipe from his lip.\r\n\r\nThen Perrine saw that it was the rag woman to whom she had sold Palikare\r\nat the Horse Market. The woman did not recognize her at first. She\r\nstared hard at her for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Sure I've seen yer somewhere,\" she said at last.\r\n\r\n\"It was I who sold you Palikare,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Why, sure it's you, little one, but what in Heaven's name are you doin'\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine could not reply. She was so giddy her head whirled. She had been\r\nsitting up, but now she was obliged to lie down again, and her pallor\r\nand tears spoke for her.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? Are you sick?\" demanded La Rouquerie.\r\n\r\nAlthough Perrine moved her lips as though to speak, no sound came. Again\r\nshe was sinking into unconsciousness, partly from emotion, partly from\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nBut La Rouquerie was a woman of experience; she had seen all miseries.\r\n\r\n\"The kid's dying of hunger,\" she muttered to herself.\r\n\r\nShe hurried over the road to a little truck over the sides of which\r\nwere spread out some dried rabbit skins. The woman quickly opened a box\r\nand took out a slice of bread, a piece of cheese and a bottle. She\r\ncarried it back on the run.\r\n\r\nPerrine was still in the same condition.\r\n\r\n\"One little minute, girlie; one little minute,\" she said encouragingly.\r\n\r\nKneeling down beside little Perrine, she put the bottle to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Take a good drink; that'll keep you up,\" she said.\r\n\r\nTrue, the good drink brought the blood back to her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" murmured Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now you must eat, but gently; wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nShe broke off a piece of bread and cheese and offered it to her.\r\n\r\n\"Eat it slowly,\" she said, advisedly, for already Perrine had devoured\r\nthe half of what was handed to her. \"I'll eat with you, then you won't\r\neat so fast.\"\r\n\r\nPalikare had been standing quietly looking on with his big soft eyes.\r\nWhen he saw La Rouquerie sit down on the grass beside Perrine, he also\r\nknelt down beside them.\r\n\r\n\"The old rogue, he wants a bite, too,\" said the woman.\r\n\r\n\"May I give him a piece?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can give him a piece or two. When we've eaten this there is\r\nmore in the cart. Give him some; he is so pleased to see you again, good\r\nold boy. You know he _is_ a good boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, isn't he a dear?\" said Perrine, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Now when you've eaten that you can tell me how you come to be in these\r\nwoods pretty near starved to death. Sure it'd be a pity for you to kick\r\nthe bucket yet awhile.\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had eaten as much as was good for her, Perrine told her story,\r\ncommencing with the death of her mother. When she came to the scene she\r\nhad had with the baker woman at St. Denis, the woman took her pipe from\r\nher mouth and called the baker woman some very bad names.\r\n\r\n\"She's a thief, a thief!\" she cried. \"I've never given bad money to no\r\none, 'cause I never take any from nobody. Be easy! She'll give that back\r\nto me next time I pass by her shop, or I'll put the whole neighborhood\r\nagainst her. I've friends at St. Denis, and we'll set her store on fire\r\nif she don't give it up!\"\r\n\r\nPerrine finished her story.\r\n\r\n\"You was just about goin' to die,\" said La Rouquerie; \"what was the\r\nfeelin' like?\"\r\n\r\n\"At first I felt very sad,\" said Perrine, \"and I think I must have cried\r\nlike one cries in the night when one is suffocating; then I dreamed of\r\nHeaven and of the good food I should have there. Mama, who was waiting\r\nfor me, had made me some milk chocolate; I could smell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's funny that this heat wave, which was going to kill you, really\r\nwas the cause of yer bein' saved. If it hadn't been for this darned heat\r\nI never should have stopped to let that donkey rest in this wood, and\r\nthen he wouldn't have found yer. What cher goin' to do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And tomorrow? What yer got to eat? One's got to be young like you to\r\ntake such a trip as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what could I do?\"\r\n\r\nLa Rouquerie gravely took two or three puffs at her pipe. She was\r\nthoughtful for a moment; then she said:\r\n\r\n\"See here, I'm goin' as far as Creil, no farther. I'm buyin' odds and\r\nends in the villages as I go along. It's on the way to Chantilly, so you\r\ncome along with me. Now yell out a bit if you've got the strength:\r\n'Rabbit skins! Rags and bones to sell!'\"\r\n\r\nPerrine straightened herself and cried out as she was told.\r\n\r\n\"That's fine! You've got a good, clear voice. As I've got a sore throat,\r\nyou can do the calling out for me, so like that you'll earn your grub.\r\nWhen we get to Creil I know a farmer there who goes as far as Amiens to\r\nget eggs and things. I'll ask him to take you in his cart. When you get\r\nto Amiens you can take the train to where yer relations hang out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what with? How can I take a train?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll advance you the five francs that I'm goin' to get back from that\r\nbaker. I'll get it! So I'll give yer five francs for your fare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMARAUCOURT AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThings came to pass as La Rouquerie had arranged. For eight days Perrine\r\nran through the streets of the villages and towns crying out: \"Rabbit\r\nskins! Rags! Bones!\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got a voice that would make yer famous for this here business,\"\r\nsaid La Rouquerie admiringly, as Perrine's clear treble was heard in the\r\nstreets. \"If yer'd stay with me you'd be doin' me a service and yer\r\nwouldn't be unhappy. You'd make a livin'. Is it a go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, but it's not possible,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\nFinding that the reasons she advanced were not sufficient to induce\r\nPerrine to stay with her, La Rouquerie put forth another:\r\n\r\n\"And yer wouldn't have to leave Palikare.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a great grief, but Perrine had made up her mind.\r\n\r\n\"I must go to my relations; I really must,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Did your relatives save yer life, like that there donkey?\" insisted La\r\nRouquerie.\r\n\r\n\"But I promised my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, but you see one fine day you'll be sorry yer didn't take what\r\nI offered yer p'raps.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind and I shall always remember you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Creil, La Rouquerie hunted up her friend, the farmer,\r\nand asked him to give Perrine a lift in his cart as far as Amiens. He\r\nwas quite willing, and for one whole day Perrine enjoyed the comfort of\r\nlying stretched out on the straw, behind two good trotting horses. At\r\nEssentaux she slept in a barn.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, and she was up bright and early and quickly\r\nmade her way to the railway station. Handing her five francs to the\r\nticket seller she asked for a ticket to Picquigny. This time she had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing that her five francs was accepted. She received\r\nher ticket and seventy-five cents in change.\r\n\r\nIt was 12 o'clock when the train pulled in at the station at Picquigny.\r\nIt was a beautiful, sunny morning, the air was soft and warm, far\r\ndifferent from the scorching heat which had prostrated her in the woods,\r\nand she ... how unlike she was from that miserable little girl who had\r\nfallen by the wayside. And she was clean, too. During the days she had\r\nspent with La Rouquerie she had been able to mend her waist and her\r\nskirt, and had washed her linen and shined her shoes. Her past\r\nexperience was a lesson: she must never give up hope at the darkest\r\nmoment; she must always remember that there was a silver cloud, if she\r\nwould only persevere.\r\n\r\nShe had a long walk after she got out of the train at Picquigny. But\r\nshe walked along lightly past the meadows bordered with poplars and\r\nlimes, past the river where the villagers in their Sunday clothes were\r\nfishing, past the windmills which, despite the fact that the day was\r\ncalm, were slowly moving round, blown by the breeze from the sea which\r\ncould be felt even there.\r\n\r\nShe walked through the pretty village of St. Pipoy, with its red roofs\r\nand quaint church, and over the railway tracks which unites the towns\r\nwherein Vulfran Paindavoine has his factories, and which joins the main\r\nline to Boulogne.\r\n\r\nAs Perrine passed the pretty church the people were coming out from\r\nmass. Listening to them as they talked in groups she heard again the\r\nsing-song manner of talking that her father had often imitated so as to\r\namuse her.\r\n\r\nOn the country road she saw a young girl walking slowly ahead of her\r\ncarrying a very heavy basket on her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the way to Maraucourt?\" Perrine asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this road ... quite straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite straight,\" said Perrine laughing, \"it isn't so very straight after\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are going to Maraucourt, I'm going there too, and we could go\r\ntogether,\" suggested the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I will if you'll let me help you carry your basket,\" said Perrine with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"I won't say no to that, for it's sure heavy!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl put her basket on the ground and breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"You don't belong to Maraucourt, do you?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"No, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you work in the factories?\"\r\n\r\n\"Should say so, everybody does here.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much do they pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten sous.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it hard work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very; but you have to have a sharp eye and not waste time. Do you want\r\nto get in there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if they'd have me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should say they would have you; they take anybody. If they didn't how do\r\nyou think they'd get the seven thousand hands they've got. Just be there\r\ntomorrow morning at 6 o'clock at the gate. We must hurry now or I'll be\r\nlate. Come on.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the handle of the basket on one side and Perrine took it on the\r\nother side and they set out on the road, keeping in step down the middle.\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity for Perrine to learn what held interest for her. It\r\nwas too good for her not to seize it. But she was afraid to question this\r\ngirl openly. She must put the questions she wanted answered in a way that\r\nwould not arouse her suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"Were you born at Maraucourt?\" she began.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I'm a native and my mother was too, my father came from Picquigny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you lost them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I live with my grandmother who keeps a grocer store and restaurant.\r\nShe's Madame Françoise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Madame Françoise.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! do you know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I just said, 'Ah, Madame Françoise.'\"\r\n\r\n\"She's known everywhere for her 'eats' and 'cause she was nurse to Monsieur\r\nEdmond Paindavoine. Whenever the men want to ask the boss, Monsieur Vulfran\r\nPaindavoine, for anything, they get my grandmother to ask for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she always get what they want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes yes, sometimes no; Monsieur Vulfran ain't always obliging.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your grandmother was nurse to Monsieur Edmond why doesn't she ask\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Edmond? he's the boss' son, and he went away from here before I was\r\nborn, no one's seen him since. He had a quarrel with his father, and his\r\nfather sent him to India to buy jute. The boss has made his fortune out\r\nof jute. He's rich, as rich as....\"\r\n\r\nShe could not think how rich M. Vulfran was so she said abruptly: \"Now\r\nshall we change arms?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you like. What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rosalie. What's yours?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine did not want to give her real name, so she chanced on one.\r\n\r\n\"Aurelie,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThey rested for a while, then went on again at their regular step.\r\n\r\n\"You say that the son had a quarrel with his father,\" said Perrine,\r\n\"then went away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the old gentleman got madder still with him 'cause he married\r\na Hindu girl, and a marriage like that doesn't count. His father wanted\r\nhim to marry a young lady who came of a very fine family, the best in\r\nPicardy. It was because he wanted his son to marry this other girl that\r\nhe built the beautiful mansion he's got. It cost millions and millions\r\nof francs. But M. Edmond wouldn't part with the wife he's got over there\r\nto take up with the young lady here, so the quarrel got worse and worse,\r\nand now they don't even know if the son is dead or alive. They haven't\r\nhad news of him for years, so they say. Monsieur Vulfran doesn't speak\r\nto anyone about it, neither do the two nephews.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he has nephews?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Monsieur Theodore Paindavoine, his brother's son, and Monsieur\r\nCasimir Bretoneux, his sister's son, who help him in the business. If M.\r\nEdmond doesn't come back the fortune and all the factories will go to\r\nhis two nephews.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, really!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and that'll be a sad thing, sad for the whole town. Them nephews\r\nain't no good for the business ... and so many people have to get their\r\nliving from it. Sure, it'll be a sad day when they get it, and they will\r\nif poor M. Edmond doesn't come back. On Sundays, when I serve the meals,\r\nI hear all sorts of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"About his nephews?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about them two and others also. But it's none of our business;\r\nlet's talk of something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, why not?\"\r\n\r\nAs Perrine did not want to appear too inquisitive, she walked on\r\nsilently, but Rosalie's tongue could not be still for very long.\r\n\r\n\"Did you come along with your parents to Maraucourt?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have no parents.\"\r\n\r\n\"No father, no mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're like me, but I've got a grandmother who's very good, and she'd\r\nbe still better if it wasn't for my uncles and aunts; she has to please\r\nthem. If it wasn't for them I should not have to work in the factories;\r\nI should stay at home and help in the store, but grandmother can't do as\r\nshe wants always. So you're all alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it your own idea to leave Paris and come to Maraucourt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was told that I might find work at Maraucourt, so instead of going\r\nfurther on to some relations, I stopped here. If you don't know your\r\nrelations, and they don't know you, you're not sure if you're going to get\r\na welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true. If there are kind ones, there are some mighty unkind ones\r\nin this world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is so,\" Perrine said, nodding her pretty head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't worry; you'll find work in the factories. Ten sous a day is\r\nnot much, but it's something, and you can get as much as twenty-two sous.\r\nI'm going to ask you a question; you can answer or not, as you like. Have\r\nyou got any money?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you'd like to lodge at my grandmother's, that'll cost you\r\ntwenty-eight sous a week, pay in advance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can pay twenty-eight sous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I don't promise you a fine room all to yourself at that price;\r\nthere'll be six in the same room, but you'll have a bed, some sheets and\r\na coverlet. Everybody ain't got that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like it and thank you very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"My grandmother don't only take in lodgers who can only pay twenty-eight\r\nsous. We've got some very fine rooms in our house. Our boarders are\r\nemployed at the factories. There's Monsieur Fabry, the engineer of the\r\nbuilding; Monsieur Mombleux, the head clerk, and Mr. Bendit, who has\r\ncharge of the foreign correspondence. If you ever speak to him always\r\ncall him Mr. Benndite. He's an Englishman, and he gets mad if you\r\npronounce his name 'Bendit.' He thinks that one wants to insult him,\r\njust as though one was calling him 'Thief'!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't forget; besides, I know English.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know English! You!\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother was English.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, so! Well, that'll be fine for Mr. Bendit, but he'd be more pleased if\r\nyou knew every language. His great stunt on Sunday is to read prayers that\r\nare printed in twenty-five languages. When he's gone through them once, he\r\ngoes over them again and again. Every Sunday he does the same thing. All\r\nthe same, he's a very fine man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGRANDFATHER VULFRAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the great trees which framed the road on either side, Perrine\r\ncould see beyond the hill the tops of some high chimneys and buildings.\r\n\r\n\"We're coming to Maraucourt,\" said Rosalie; \"you'll see Monsieur\r\nPaindavoine's mansion soon, then the factories. We shan't see the\r\nvillage until we get down the other side of the hill. Over by the river\r\nthere's the church and cemetery.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as they neared the spot where the poplars were swaying, there came\r\ninto view a beautiful chateau towering grandly above the trees, with its\r\nfaçade of stone gabled roofs and chimneys standing out magnificently in a\r\npark planted with trees and shrubs which stretched out as far as the\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nPerrine stopped short in amazement, whilst Rosalie continue to step out.\r\nThis made them jolt the basket, whereupon Rosalie plumped it down on the\r\nground and stretched herself.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you think that fine, don't you?\" said Rosalie, following Perrine's\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's beautiful,\" said Perrine, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, old Monsieur Vulfran lives there all alone. He's got a dozen\r\nservants to wait on him, without counting the gardeners and stablemen who\r\nlive in those quarters over there at the end of the park. That place over\r\nthere is the electric power house for lighting up the chateau. Fine, ain't\r\nit? And you should see the inside! There's gold everywhere, and velvets,\r\nand such carpets! Them nephews want to live there with him, but he won't\r\nhave 'em. He even eats his meals all alone.\"\r\n\r\nThey took up the basket and went on again. Soon they saw a general view of\r\nthe works. But to Perrine's eyes there seemed only a confusion of\r\nbuildings, some old, some new, just a great gray mass with big, tall\r\nchimneys everywhere. Then they came to the first houses of the village,\r\nwith apple trees and pear trees growing in the gardens. Here was the\r\nvillage of which her father had spoken so often.\r\n\r\nWhat struck her most was the number of people she saw. Groups of men, women\r\nand children dressed up in their Sunday clothes stood chatting before the\r\nhouses or sat in the low rooms, the windows of which were thrown wide open.\r\nA mass of people, people everywhere. In the low-ceiling rooms, where those\r\nfrom outside could see all that was passing within, some were drinking\r\nbright colored drinks, others had jugs of cider, while others had on the\r\ntables before them black coffee or whisky. And what a tapping of glasses\r\nand voices raised in angry dispute!\r\n\r\n\"What a lot of people there seem to be drinking,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"That's because it's Sunday. They got two weeks' pay yesterday. They\r\ncan't always drink like this; you'll see.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was characteristic of most of the houses was that nearly all,\r\nalthough old and badly built of brick or wood, affected an air of\r\ncoquetry, at least in the painting that embellished the doors and\r\nwindows. This attracted the eye like a sign. And in truth it was a sign,\r\nfor in default of other preparations, the bright paint gave a promise of\r\ncleanliness which a glance at the inside of the place belied at once.\r\n\r\n\"We've arrived,\" said Rosalie, pointing with her free hand to a small\r\nred brick house which stood a little way from the road, behind a ragged\r\nhedge. Adjoining the house was a store where general provisions were\r\nsold, and also liquor. The floors above were rented to the best lodgers,\r\nand behind the house was a building which was rented out to the factory\r\nhands. A little gate in the hedge led to a small garden planted with\r\napple trees and to a gravel walk leading to the house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Rosalie and Perrine entered the yard, a woman, still young,\r\ncalled out from the doorway: \"Hurry up, you slow coach! Say, you take a\r\ntime to go to Picquigny, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my Aunt Zenobie,\" whispered Rosalie; \"she's none too nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"What yer whispering there?\" yelled the disagreeable woman.\r\n\r\n\"I said that if somebody hadn't been there to help carry this basket I\r\nwouldn't be here by now,\" retorted Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better hold your tongue!\"\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered in such a shrill tone that they brought a tall\r\nold woman to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you going on at now, Zenobie?\" she asked, calmly.\r\n\r\n\"She's mad 'cause I'm late, grandmother; but the basket's awful heavy,\"\r\nsaid Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"There, there!\" said the grandmother, placidly; \"put it down and go and\r\nget your supper; you'll find it kept warm on the stove.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wait for me here in the yard,\" said Rosalie to Perrine; \"I'll be\r\nout in a minute and we'll have supper together. You go and buy your\r\nbread. You'll find the baker in the third house on the left. Hurry up.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Perrine returned she found Rosalie seated at a table under a big\r\napple tree. On the table were two plates full of meat stew and potatoes.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down and share my stew,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"But ...\" hesitated Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"You don't like to take it; you can. I asked my grandmother, and it's\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\nIn that case Perrine thought that she should accept this hospitality, so\r\nshe sat down at the table opposite her new friend.\r\n\r\n\"And it's all arranged about your lodging here,\" said Rosalie, with her\r\nmouth full of stew. \"You've only to give your twenty-eight sous to\r\ngrandmother. That's where you'll be.\"\r\n\r\nRosalie pointed to a house a part of which could be seen at the end of\r\nthe yard; the rest of it was hidden by the brick house. It looked such a\r\ndilapidated old place that one wondered how it still held together.\r\n\r\n\"My grandmother lived there before she built this house,\" explained\r\nRosalie. \"She did it with the money that she got when she was nurse for\r\nMonsieur Edmond. You won't be comfortable down there as you would in\r\nthis house, but factory hands can't live like rich people, can they?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine agreed that they could not.\r\n\r\nAt another table, standing a little distance from theirs, a man about\r\nforty years of age, grave, stiff, wearing a coat buttoned up and a high\r\nhat, was reading a small book with great attention.\r\n\r\n\"That's Mr. Bendit; he's reading his Bible,\" whispered Rosalie.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, with no respect for the gentleman's occupation, she said:\r\n\"Monsieur Bendit, here's a girl who speaks English.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said, without raising his eyes from his Bible.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes elapsed before he lifted his eyes and turned them to\r\nPerrine.\r\n\r\n\"Are you an English girl?\" he asked in English.\r\n\r\n\"No, but my mother was,\" replied Perrine in the same language.\r\n\r\nWithout another word he went on with his reading.\r\n\r\nThey were just finishing their supper when a carriage coming along the\r\nroad stopped at the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Monsieur Vulfran in his carriage!\" cried Rosalie, getting up\r\nfrom her seat and running to the gate.\r\n\r\nPerrine did not dare leave her place, but she looked towards the road.\r\n\r\nTwo people were in the buggy. A young man was driving for an old man\r\nwith white hair, who, although seated, seemed to be very tall. It was M.\r\nPaindavoine.\r\n\r\nRosalie went up to the buggy.\r\n\r\n\"Here is someone,\" said the young man, who was about to get out.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" demanded M. Paindavoine.\r\n\r\nIt was Rosalie who replied to this question.\r\n\r\n\"It's Rosalie, monsieur,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Tell your grandmother to come and speak to me,\" said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nRosalie ran to the house and came hurrying back with her grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"Good day, Monsieur Vulfran,\" said the old woman.\r\n\r\n\"Good day, Françoise.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, sir; I'm at your service.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've come about your brother Omer. I've just come from his place. His\r\ndrunken wife was the only person there and she could not understand\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Omer's gone to Amiens; he comes back tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him that I have heard that he has rented his hall to some rascals\r\nto hold a public meeting and ... I don't wish that meeting to take\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if they've rented it, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"He can compromise. If he doesn't, the very next day I'll put him out.\r\nThat's one of the conditions that I made. I'll do what I say. I don't\r\nwant any meeting of that sort here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There have been some at Flexelles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flexelles is not Maraucourt. I do not want the people of my village to\r\nbecome like those at Flexelles. It's my duty to guard against that. You\r\nunderstand? Tell Omer what I say. Good day, Françoise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good day, Monsieur Vulfran.\"\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his vest pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Rosalie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, Monsieur Vulfran.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out a ten cent piece.\r\n\r\n\"This is for you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Monsieur Vulfran,\" said Rosalie, taking the money with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nThe buggy went off.\r\n\r\nPerrine had not lost a word of what had been said, but what impressed her\r\nmore than the actual words was the tone of authority in which they had been\r\nspoken. \"I don't wish that meeting to take place.\" She had never heard\r\nanyone speak like that before. The tone alone bespoke how firm was the\r\nwill, but the old gentleman's uncertain, hesitating gestures did not seem\r\nto accord with his words.\r\n\r\nRosalie returned to her seat, delighted.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Paindavoine gave me ten cents,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw him,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Let's hope Aunt Zenobie won't know, or she'll take it to keep it for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Paindavoine did not seem as though he knew you,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Not know me? Why, he's my godfather!\" exclaimed Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"But he said 'Where is Rosalie?' when you were standing quite near him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's because he's blind,\" answered Rosalie, placidly.\r\n\r\n\"Blind!\" cried Perrine.\r\n\r\nShe repeated the word quite softly to herself two or three times.\r\n\r\n\"Has he been blind long?\" she asked, in the same awed voice.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time his sight was failing,\" replied Rosalie, \"but no one paid\r\nany attention; they thought that he was fretting over his son being away.\r\nThen he got pneumonia, and that left him with a bad cough, and then one day\r\nhe couldn't see to read, then he went quite blind. Think what it would have\r\nmeant to the town if he had been obliged to give up his factories! But no;\r\nhe wasn't going to give them up; not he! He goes to business just the same\r\nas though he had his sight. Those who counted on being the master there,\r\n'cause he fell ill have been put in their places.\" She lowered her voice.\r\n\"His nephews and Talouel; they're the ones I mean.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Zenobie came to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Rosalie, have you finished, you young loafer?\" she called.\r\n\r\n\"I've only just this minute got through,\" answered Rosalie, defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are some customers to wait on ... come on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to go,\" said Rosalie, regretfully. \"Sorry I can't stay with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't mind me,\" said little Perrine, politely.\r\n\r\n\"See you tonight.\"\r\n\r\nWith a slow, reluctant step Rosalie got up and dragged herself to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter her new friend had left, Perrine would like to have still sat at\r\nthe table as though she were in her own place, but it was precisely\r\nbecause she was not in the place where she belonged that she felt she\r\ncould not. She had learned that the little garden was reserved for the\r\nboarders and that the factory hands were not privileged to sit there.\r\nShe could not see any seats near the old tumble-down house where she was\r\nto lodge, so she left the table and sauntered down the village street.\r\n\r\nAlthough she went at a slow step, she had soon walked down all the\r\nstreets, and as everyone stared at her, being a stranger, this had\r\nprevented her from stopping when she had wanted to.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the hill opposite the factories she had noticed a wood.\r\nPerhaps she would be alone there and could sit down without anyone\r\npaying attention to her.\r\n\r\nShe climbed the hill, then stretched herself out on the grass and looked\r\ndown over the village ... her father's birthplace, which he had\r\ndescribed so often to her mother and herself.\r\n\r\nShe had arrived at Maraucourt! This name, which she had repeated so\r\noften since she had trod on French soil, the name she had seen on the\r\nbig vans standing outside the Gates of Paris. This was not a country of\r\ndreams. She was in Maraucourt; before her she could see the vast works\r\nwhich belonged to her grandfather. He had made his fortune here, bit by\r\nbit, sou by sou, until now he was worth millions.\r\n\r\nHer eyes wandered from the great chimneys to the railway tracks, where\r\nall was quiet on this Sabbath day, to the winding streets and the quaint\r\nhouses with their tiled or thatched roofs. Amongst the very old houses\r\nthere was one which seemed more pretentious than the others. It stood in\r\na large garden in which there were great trees and a terrace, and at the\r\nremote corner of the garden a wash-house.\r\n\r\nThat house had been described to her so many times, she recognized it. It\r\nwas the one in which her grandfather had lived before he had built the\r\nbeautiful chateau. How many hours her father, when a boy, had spent in that\r\nwash-house on washing days, listening to the washerwomen's chatter and to\r\nthe stories they told, quaint old legends. He had remembered them all those\r\nyears, and later on had told them to his little daughter. There was the\r\n\"Fairy of the Cascade\", \"The Whirling Dwarf\", and lots of others. She\r\nremembered them all, and her dead father had listened to the old women\r\ntelling them at that very spot down there by the river.\r\n\r\nThe sun was in her eyes now, so she changed her place. She found another\r\ngrassy nook and sat down again, very thoughtful. She was thinking of\r\nher future, poor little girl.\r\n\r\nShe was sure of getting work now, and bread and a place in which to\r\nsleep, but that was not all. How would she ever be able to realize her\r\ndead mother's hopes? She trembled; it all seemed so difficult; but at\r\nleast she had accomplished one great thing in having reached Maraucourt.\r\n\r\nShe must never despair, never give up hope, and now that she had a roof\r\nover her head and ten sous a day, although not much, it was far better\r\nnow for her than a few days ago, when she had been penniless, famished,\r\nand had had no place where to lay her head.\r\n\r\nShe thought it would be wise, as she was beginning a new life on the\r\nmorrow, that she should make a plan of what she should and what she\r\nshould not say. But she was so ignorant of everything, and she soon\r\nrealized that this was a task beyond her. If her mother had reached\r\nMaraucourt she would have known just what to have done. But she, poor\r\nlittle girl, had had no experience; she had not the wisdom nor the\r\nintelligence of a grown-up person; she was but a child, and alone.\r\n\r\nThis thought and the memory of her mother brought tears to her eyes. She\r\nbegan to cry unrestrainedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, dear mother,\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\nThen her mother's last words came to her: \"I see ... I know that you\r\nwill be happy!\"\r\n\r\nHer mother's words might come true. Those who are at Death's door,\r\ntheir souls hovering between Heaven and earth, may have sometimes a\r\ndivine knowledge of things which are not revealed to the living.\r\n\r\nThis burst of emotion, instead of making her more despondent, did her\r\ngood. After she had wiped her tears away she was more hopeful, and it\r\nseemed to her that the light evening breeze which fanned her cheek from\r\ntime to time brought her a kiss from her mother, touching her wet cheeks\r\nand whispering to her her last words: \"I see ... I know you will be\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd why should it not be so? Why should her mother not be near her,\r\nleaning over her at this moment like a guardian angel? For a long time\r\nshe sat deep in thought. Her beautiful little face was very grave. She\r\nwondered, would everything come out all right for her in the end?\r\n\r\nThen mechanically her eye fell on a large cluster of marguerites. She\r\ngot up quickly and picked a few, closing her eyes so as not to choose.\r\n\r\nShe came back to her place and, taking up one with a hand that shook,\r\nshe commenced to pick off the petals, one at a time, saying: \"I shall\r\nsucceed; a little; a lot; completely; not at all.\" She repeated this\r\nvery carefully until there were only a few petals left on the last\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nHow many, she did not want to count, for their number would have told\r\nher the answer. So, with a heart beating rapidly, she quickly pulled off\r\nthe last petals.\r\n\r\n\"I shall succeed; a little; a lot; completely....\"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a warm breeze passed over her hair, over her lips. It\r\nwas surely her mother's reply in a kiss, the tenderest that she had ever\r\ngiven her.\r\n\r\nThe night fell. She decided to go. Already down the straight road as far\r\nas the river white vapors were rising, floating lightly around the great\r\ntrees. Here and there little lights from behind the windows of the\r\nhouses pierced the gathering darkness, and vague sounds broke the\r\nsilence of the peaceful Sabbath evening.\r\n\r\nThere was no need for her to stay out late now, for she had a roof to\r\ncover her and a bed to sleep in; besides, as she was to get up early the\r\nnext day to go to work, it would be better to go to bed early.\r\n\r\nAs she walked through the village she recognized that the noises that\r\nshe had heard came from the cabarets. They were full. Men and women were\r\nseated at the tables drinking. From the open door the odor of coffee,\r\nhot alcohol and tobacco filled the street as though it were a vast sink.\r\n\r\nShe passed one cabaret after another. There were so many that to every\r\nthree houses there was at least one in which liquor was sold. On her\r\ntramps along the high roads and through the various towns she had seen\r\nmany drinking places, but nowhere had she heard such words, so clear and\r\nshrill, as those which came confusedly from the low rooms.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached Mother Françoise's garden she saw Mr. Bendit still\r\nreading. Before him was a lighted candle, a piece of newspaper protecting\r\nthe light, around which the moths and mosquitoes flew. But he paid no\r\nattention to them, so absorbed was he in his reading.\r\n\r\nYet, as she was passing him, he raised his head and recognized her. For the\r\npleasure of speaking in his own language, he spoke to her in English.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you'll have a good night's rest,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she replied. \"Good night, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" he continued in English.\r\n\r\n\"I took a walk as far as the woods,\" she replied in the same language.\r\n\r\n\"All alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I do not know anyone here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't you stay in and read. There is nothing better to do on\r\nSunday than read.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Well, I'll lend you. Good night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, sir.\"\r\n\r\nRosalie was seated in the doorway taking the fresh air.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to go to bed now?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'd like to,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take you up there then, but first you'll have to arrange with\r\ngrandmother. Go to the café; she's there.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter, having been arranged by Rosalie and her grandmother beforehand,\r\nwas quickly settled. Perrine laid her twenty-eight sous on the table and\r\ntwo sous extra for lighting for the week.\r\n\r\n\"So you are going to stay in our village, little one?\" asked Mother\r\nFrançoise, with a kindly, placid air.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if it is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do it if you'll work.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all I ask,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's all right. You won't stop at ten sous; you'll soon get a\r\nfranc or perhaps two, then later on you'll marry a good workingman\r\nwho'll earn three. Between you, that'll be five francs a day. With that\r\nyou're rich ... if you don't drink; but one mustn't drink. It's a good\r\nthing that M. Vulfran can give employment to the whole county. There is\r\nthe land, to be sure, but tilling ground can't provide a living to all\r\nwho have to be fed.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst the old nurse babbled this advice with the importance and the\r\nauthority of a woman accustomed to having her word respected, Rosalie\r\nwas getting some linen from a closet, and Perrine, who, while listening,\r\nhad been looking at her, saw that the sheets were made of a thick yellow\r\ncanvas. It was so long since she had slept in sheets that she ought to\r\nthink herself fortunate to get even these, hard though they were. La\r\nRouquerie on her tramps had never spent money for a bed, and a long time\r\nago the sheets they had in the wagon, with the exception of those kept\r\nfor her mother, had been sold or worn to rags.\r\n\r\nShe went with Rosalie across the yard where about twenty men, women and\r\nchildren were seated on a clump of wood or standing about, talking and\r\nsmoking, waiting for the hour to retire. How could all these people live\r\nin the old house, which seemed far from large?\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the attic, after Rosalie had lit a candle stuck behind a\r\nwire trellis, Perrine understood. In a space of six yards long and a\r\nlittle more than three wide, six beds were placed along the length of\r\nthe walls, and the passage between the beds was only one yard wide. Six\r\npeople, then, had to spend the night in a place where there was scarcely\r\nroom for two. Although a little window opened on the yard opposite the\r\ndoor, there was a rank, sharp odor which made Perrine gasp. But she said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Rosalie, \"you think it's a bit small, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is, rather,\" was all she said.\r\n\r\n\"Four sous a night is not one hundred sous, you know,\" remarked Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Perrine, with a smothered sigh.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it was better for her to have a place in this tiny room than\r\nbe out in the woods and fields. If she had been able to endure the odor\r\nin Grain-of-Salt's shack, she would probably be able to bear it here.\r\n\r\n\"There's your bed,\" said Rosalie, pointing to one placed near the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nWhat she called a bed was a straw mattress placed on four feet and held\r\ntogether by two boards. Instead of a pillow there was a sack.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said Rosalie, \"this is fresh straw; they never give old\r\nstraw to anyone to sleep on. In the hotels they do that sort of thing,\r\nbut we don't here.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there were too many beds in the little room, there was not one\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"There are some nails on the walls,\" said Rosalie, in reply to Perrine's\r\nquestioning look; \"you can hang your clothes up there.\"\r\n\r\nThere were also some boxes and baskets under the bed. If the lodgers had\r\nany underwear they could make use of these, but as Perrine had only what\r\nshe was wearing, the nail at the head of the bed was sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"They're all honest here,\" remarked Rosalie, \"and if La Noyelle talks in\r\nthe night it's 'cause she's been drinking; she's a chatterbox. Tomorrow\r\nyou get up with the others. I'll tell you where you have to go to wash.\r\nGood night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, and thank you,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly undressed, thankful that she was alone and would not have\r\nto submit to the inquisitive regards of the other occupants of the room.\r\nBut when she was between the sheets she did not feel so comfortable as\r\nshe had hoped, for they were very rough and hard. But then the ground\r\nhad seemed very hard the first time she had slept on it, and she had\r\nquickly grown accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the door was opened and a young girl about\r\nfifteen came in and commenced to get undressed. From time to time she\r\nglanced at Perrine, but without saying a word. As she was in her Sunday\r\nclothes, her disrobing took longer than usual, for she had to put away\r\nher best dress in a small box and hang her working clothes on the nail\r\nfor the next day.\r\n\r\nA second girl came in, then a third, then a fourth. There was a babble\r\nof tongues, all talking at the same time, each relating what had\r\nhappened during the day. In the narrow space between the beds they\r\npulled out and pushed back their boxes or baskets, and with each effort\r\ncame an outburst of impatience and furious upbraidings against the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\r\n\"What a hole!\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll be putting another bed in here soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure! But I won't stay!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where would yer go? It ain't no better nowhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThe complaining, mixed with a desultory chatter, continued. At length,\r\nhowever, when the two who had first arrived were in bed, a little order\r\nwas established. Soon all the beds were occupied but one.\r\n\r\nBut even then the conversation did not cease. They had discussed the\r\ndoings of the day just passed, so now they went on to the next day, to\r\nthe work at the factories, the quarrels, the doings of the heads of the\r\nconcern--M. Vulfran Paindavoine and his nephews, whom they called \"the\r\nkids,\" and the foreman, Talouel. They spoke of this man by name only\r\nonce, but the names they called him bespoke better than words what they\r\nthought of him.\r\n\r\nPerrine experienced a strange contradictory feeling which surprised her.\r\nShe wanted to hear everything, for this information might be of great\r\nimportance to her, yet on the other hand she felt embarrassed, almost\r\nashamed, to listen to such talk.\r\n\r\nMost of the talk was rather vague to Perrine, not knowing the persons to\r\nwhom it applied, but she soon gathered that \"Skinny\", \"Judas\", and\r\n\"Sneak\" were all one and the same man, and that man was Talouel, the\r\nforeman. The factory hands evidently considered him a bully; they all\r\nhated him, yet feared him.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go to sleep,\" at last said one.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"La Noyelle hasn't come in yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw her outside when I came in.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Full. She couldn't stand up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! d'ye think she can get upstairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not sure about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we lock the door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and what a row she'd make!\"\r\n\r\n\"Like last Sunday; maybe worse.\"\r\n\r\nThey groaned. At this moment the sound of heavy shambling footsteps was\r\nheard on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Here she is.\"\r\n\r\nThe steps stopped, then there was a fall, followed by a moan.\r\n\r\n\"She's fallen down!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose she can't get up?\"\r\n\r\n\"She'd sleep as well on the stairs as here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'd sleep better.\"\r\n\r\nThe moaning continued, interrupted by calls for help.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Laide,\" called out a thick voice; \"give us a hand, my child.\"\r\n\r\nBut Laide did not move. After a time the calls ceased.\r\n\r\n\"She's gone to sleep. That's luck.\"\r\n\r\nBut the drunken girl had not gone to sleep at all; on the contrary, she\r\nwas using every effort to get up the stairs again.\r\n\r\n\"Laide, come and give me a hand, child. Laide, Laide,\" she cried.\r\n\r\nShe evidently made no progress, for the calls still came from the bottom\r\nof the stairs, and became more and more persistent. Finally she began to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\"Little Laide, little Laide, come to me,\" she wailed. \"Oh! oh! the\r\nstairs are slipping; where am I?\"\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter came from each bed.\r\n\r\n\"It's cause yer ain't come in yet, Laide; that's why yer don't come.\r\nI'll go and find yer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now she's gone and we'll have some peace,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"No, she'll go to look for Laide and won't find her, and it'll all\r\nbegin over again. Well never get to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and give her a hand, Laide,\" advised one.\r\n\r\n\"Go yerself,\" retorted Laide.\r\n\r\n\"But she wants you.\"\r\n\r\nLaide decided to go, and slipping on her skirt, she went down the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my child, my child,\" cried La Noyelle, brokenly, when she caught\r\nsight of her.\r\n\r\nThe joy of seeing Laide drove all thoughts of getting upstairs safely\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me, little one, and I'll treat you to a glass; come on,\"\r\nurged the drunken creature.\r\n\r\nBut Laide would not be tempted.\r\n\r\n\"No, come on to bed,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe woman continued to insist.\r\n\r\nThey argued for a long time, La Noyelle repeating the words, \"a little\r\nglass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to go to sleep,\" said one of the girls in bed. \"How long is this\r\ngoing to keep up? And we got to be up early tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord! and it's like this every Sunday,\" sighed another.\r\n\r\nAnd little Perrine had thought that if she only had a roof over her head\r\nshe would be able to sleep in peace! The open fields, with their dark\r\nshadows and the chances of bad weather, was far better than this crowded\r\nroom, reeking with odors that were almost suffocating her. She wondered\r\nif she would be able to pass the night in this dreadful room.\r\n\r\nThe argument was still going on at the foot of the stairs. La Noyelle's\r\nvoice could be heard repeating \"a little glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm goin' to help Laide,\" said one, \"or this'll last till tomorrow.\"\r\nThe woman got up and went down the narrow stairs. Then came the sound of\r\nangry voices, heavy footsteps and blows. The people on the ground floor\r\ncame out to see what was the matter, and finally everyone in the house\r\nwas awake.\r\n\r\nAt last La Noyelle was dragged into the room, crying out in despair.\r\n\r\n\"What have I done to you that you should be so unkind to me?\"\r\n\r\nIgnoring her complaints, they undressed her and put her into bed, but\r\neven then she did not sleep, but continued to moan and cry.\r\n\r\n\"What have I done to you girls that you should treat me so badly. I'm\r\nvery unhappy, and I'm thirsty.\"\r\n\r\nShe continued to complain until everyone was so exasperated that they\r\none and all shouted out in anger.\r\n\r\nHowever, she went on all the same. She carried on a conversation with an\r\nimaginary person till the occupants of the room were driven to distraction.\r\nNow and again her voice dropped as though she were going off to sleep, then\r\nsuddenly she cried out in a shriller voice, and those who had dropped off\r\ninto a slumber awoke with a start and frightened her badly, but despite\r\ntheir anger she would not stop.\r\n\r\nPerrine wondered if it really was to be like that every Sunday. How\r\ncould they put up with her? Was there no place in Maraucourt where one\r\ncould sleep peacefully?\r\n\r\nIt was not alone the noise that disturbed her, but the air was now so\r\nstifling that she could scarcely breathe.\r\n\r\nAt last La Noyelle was quiet, or rather it was only a prolonged snore\r\nthat came from her lips.\r\n\r\nBut although all was silent Perrine could not sleep. She was oppressed.\r\nIt seemed as though a hammer was beating on her forehead, and she was\r\nperspiring from head to foot.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be wondered at. She was suffocating for want of air; and\r\nif the other girls in the room were not stifled like her, it was because\r\nthey were accustomed to this atmosphere, which to one who was in the\r\nhabit of sleeping in the open air was unbearable.\r\n\r\nBut she thought that if they could endure it she should. But\r\nunfortunately one does not breathe as one wishes, nor when one wishes.\r\nIf she closed her mouth she could not get enough air into her lungs.\r\n\r\nWhat was going to happen to her? She struggled up in bed, tearing at the\r\npaper which replaced the window pane against which her bed was placed. She\r\ntore away the paper, doing so as quietly as possible so as not to wake the\r\ngirls beside her. Then putting her mouth to the opening she leaned her\r\ntired little head on the window sill. Finally in sheer weariness she fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE HUT ON THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke a pale streak of light fell across the window, but it was\r\nso feeble that it did not lighten the room. Outside the cocks were\r\ncrowing. Day was breaking.\r\n\r\nA chill, damp air was penetrating through the opening she had made in\r\nthe window, but in spite of that the bad odor in the room still\r\nremained. It was dreadful!\r\n\r\nYet all the girls slept a deep slumber, only broken now and again with a\r\nstifled moan.\r\n\r\nVery quietly she got up and dressed. Then taking her shoes in her hands\r\nshe crept down the stairs to the door. She put on her shoes and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOh! the fresh, delicious air! Never had she taken a breath with such\r\nthankfulness. She went through the little yard with her mouth wide open,\r\nher nostrils quivering, her head thrown back. The sound of her footsteps\r\nawoke a dog, which commenced to bark; then several other dogs joined in.\r\n\r\nBut what did that matter? She was no longer a little tramp at whom dogs\r\nwere at liberty to bark. If she wished to leave her bed she had a\r\nperfect right to do so; she had paid out money for it.\r\n\r\nThe yard was too small for her present mood; she felt she must move\r\nabout. She went out onto the road and walked straight ahead without\r\nknowing where.\r\n\r\nThe shades of night still filled the roads, but above her head she saw\r\nthe dawn already whitening the tops of the trees and the roofs of the\r\nhouses. In a few minutes it would be day. At this moment the clang of a\r\nbell broke the deep silence. It was the factory clock striking three.\r\nShe still had three more hours before going to work.\r\n\r\nHow should she pass the time? She could not keep walking until six, she\r\nwould be too tired; so she would find a place where she could sit down\r\nand wait.\r\n\r\nThe sky was gradually getting brighter, and round about her various\r\nforms were taking a concrete shape.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a glade she could see a small hut made of branches and\r\ntwigs which was used by the game keepers during the winter. She thought\r\nthat if she could get to the hut she would be hidden there and no one\r\nwould see her and inquire what she was doing out in the fields at that\r\nearly hour.\r\n\r\nShe found a small trail, barely traced, which seemed to lead to the hut.\r\nShe took it, and although it led her straight in the direction of the\r\nlittle cabin, she had not reached it when the path ended, for it was\r\nbuilt upon a small island upon which grew three weeping willows. Around\r\nit was a ditch full of water. Fortunately, the trunk of a tree had been\r\nthrown across the ditch. Although it was not very straight, and was wet\r\nwith the morning dew, which made it very slippery, Perrine was not\r\ndeterred from crossing.\r\n\r\nShe managed to get across, and soon found herself before the door of the\r\nlittle hut, which she only had to push to open.\r\n\r\nOh, what a pretty nest! The hut was square, and from roof to floor was\r\nlined inside with ferns. There was a little opening on each of the four\r\nsides, which from without was invisible, but from within one could gain\r\na good view of the surrounding country. On the ground was a thick bed of\r\nferns, and in one of the corners a bench made from the trunk of a tree.\r\n\r\nHow delightful! And how little it resembled the room she had just left!\r\nHow much better it would be for her if she could sleep here in the fresh\r\nair, sleeping in peace amongst the ferns, with no other noise but the\r\nrustling of the leaves and the ripple of the water.\r\n\r\nHow much better to be here than lying between Mother Françoise's hard\r\nsheets, listening to the complaints of La Noyelle and her friends in\r\nthat dreadful atmosphere which even now seemed to assail her nostrils.\r\n\r\nShe laid down on the ferns, curled up in a corner against the soft walls\r\ncovered with reeds, then closed her eyes. Before long she felt a soft\r\nnumbness creeping over her. She jumped to her feet, fearing that she\r\nmight drop off to sleep and not awake before it was time for her to go\r\nto the factory.\r\n\r\nThe sun had now risen, and through the aperture facing east a streak of\r\ngold entered the hut. Outside the birds were singing, and all over the\r\ntiny island, on the pond, on the branches of the weeping willows, was\r\nheard a confusion of sounds, twittering and little shrill cries which\r\nannounced an awakening to life. Looking out of the window, she could see\r\nthe birds picking at the humid earth with their beaks, snapping at the\r\nworms. Over the pond floated a light mist. A wild duck, far prettier\r\nthan the tame ducks, was swimming on the water, surrounded with her\r\nyoung. She tried to keep them beside her with continual little quacks,\r\nbut she found it impossible to do so. The ducklings escaped from the\r\nmother duck, scurrying off amongst the reeds to search for the insects\r\nwhich came within their reach.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a quick blue streak, like lightning, flashed before Perrine's\r\neyes. It was not until it had disappeared that she realized that it was\r\na kingfisher which had just crossed the pond. For a long time, standing\r\nquite still for fear a movement might betray her presence and cause the\r\nbirds to fly away, she stood at the opening looking out at them. How\r\npretty it all was in the morning light, gay, alive, amusing, something\r\nnew to look upon.\r\n\r\nNow and again she saw dark shadows pass capriciously over the pond. The\r\nshadows grew larger without apparent cause, covering the pond. She could\r\nnot understand this, for the sun, which had risen above the horizon, was\r\nshining in the sky without a cloud. How did these shadows come?\r\n\r\nShe went to the door and saw a thick black smoke coming from the factory\r\nchimneys.\r\n\r\nWork would commence very soon; it was time to leave the hut. As she was\r\nabout to go she picked up a newspaper from the seat that she had not\r\nnoticed before in the dim light. The newspaper was dated February 2.\r\nThen this thought came to her: This newspaper was on the only spot in\r\nthe place where one could sit down, and the date of it was several\r\nmonths previous, so then this proved that the hut had been abandoned and\r\nno one had passed through the door since last February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWORK IN THE FACTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the road a loud whistle was heard, shrill and powerful.\r\nAlmost immediately other whistles replied from the distance. This was\r\nthe call for the factory hands who lived in Maraucourt, and the other\r\nwhistles repeated the summons to work from village to village, St.\r\nPipoy, Harcheux, Racour, Flexelles, in all the Paindavoine factories,\r\nannouncing to the owner of the vast works that everywhere, at the same\r\ntime, his factories were calling to his employés to be ready for the\r\nday's work.\r\n\r\nFearing she might be late she ran as far as the village. There she found\r\nall the doors of the houses open. On the thresholds the men were eating\r\ntheir soups or leaning against the walls; others were in the cabarets\r\ndrinking wine; others were washing at the pump in the yard. No one\r\nseemed to be going to work, so evidently it was not time yet, so Perrine\r\nthought that there was no occasion for her to hurry.\r\n\r\nBut before long a louder whistle was blown, and then there was a general\r\nmovement everywhere; from houses, yards and taverns came a dense crowd,\r\nfilling the street. Men, women and children went towards the factories,\r\nsome smoking their pipes, others munching a crust of bread, the greater\r\nnumber chattering loudly. In one of the groups Perrine caught sight of\r\nRosalie in company with La Noyelle. She joined them.\r\n\r\n\"Why, where have you been?\" asked Rosalie in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I got up early so as to take a walk,\" Perrine replied.\r\n\r\n\"You did? I went to look for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you; but never do that, for I get up very early,\" said\r\nPerrine.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the factory the crowd went into the various workshops\r\nunder the watchful eye of a tall thin man who stood near the iron gates,\r\nhis hand in the pocket of his coat, his straw hat stuck on the back of\r\nhis head. His sharp eyes scanned everyone who passed.\r\n\r\n\"That's Skinny,\" informed Rosalie in a whisper.\r\n\r\nPerrine did not need to be told this. She seemed to know at once that\r\nthis was the foreman Talouel.\r\n\r\n\"Do I come in with you?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\"\r\n\r\nThis was a decisive moment for little Perrine, but she controlled her\r\nnervousness and drew herself up to her full height. Why should they not\r\ntake her if they took everyone?\r\n\r\nRosalie drew Perrine out of the crowd, then went up to Talouel.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, \"here's a friend of mine who wants a job.\"\r\n\r\nTalouel glanced sharply at the friend.\r\n\r\n\"In a moment ... we'll see,\" he replied curtly.\r\n\r\nRosalie, who knew what to do, signed to Perrine to stand aside and wait. At\r\nthis moment there was a slight commotion at the gates, and the crowd drew\r\naside respectfully to allow Monsieur Paindavoine's carriage to pass. The\r\nsame young man who had driven him the evening before was now driving.\r\nAlthough everyone knew that their chief, Vulfran Paindavoine, was blind,\r\nall the men took off their hats as he passed and the women curtseyed.\r\n\r\n\"You see he's not the last one to come,\" said Rosalie, as the phaeton\r\npassed through the gates, \"but his nephews likely will be late.\"\r\n\r\nThe clock struck, then a few late comers came running up. A young man\r\ncame hurrying along, arranging his tie as he ran.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Talouel,\" he said; \"is uncle here yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Monsieur Theodore,\" said the foreman, \"he got here a good five\r\nminutes ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not the last, though. Monsieur Casimir is late also. I can see\r\nhim coming now.\"\r\n\r\nAs Theodore went towards the offices his cousin Casimir came up\r\nhurriedly.\r\n\r\nThe two cousins were not at all alike, either in their looks or ways.\r\nCasimir gave the foreman a short nod, but did not say a word.\r\n\r\n\"What can your friend do?\" asked Talouel, turning to Rosalie, his hands\r\nstill in his pockets.\r\n\r\nPerrine herself replied to this question.\r\n\r\n\"I have not worked in a factory before,\" she said in a voice that she\r\ntried to control.\r\n\r\nTalouel gave her a sharp look, then turned again to Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Oneux to put her with the trucks. Now be off. Hurry up!\"\r\n\r\nThus dismissed, Rosalie hurried Perrine away.\r\n\r\n\"What are the trucks?\" asked little Perrine as she followed her friend\r\nthrough the big courtyard. She wondered, poor child, if she had the\r\nstrength and the intelligence to do what was required of her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's easy enough,\" replied Rosalie, lightly. \"Don't be afraid;\r\nyou've only got to load the trucks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!...\"\r\n\r\n\"And when it's full,\" continued Rosalie, \"you push it along to the place\r\nwhere they empty it. You give a good shove to begin with, then it'll go\r\nall alone.\"\r\n\r\nAs they passed down the corridors they could scarcely hear each other\r\nspeak for the noise of the machinery. Rosalie pushed open the door of\r\none of the workshops and took Perrine into a long room. There was a\r\ndeafening roar from the thousand tiny machines, yet above the noise they\r\ncould hear a man calling out: \"Ah, there you are, you loafer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's a loafer, pray?\" retorted Rosalie. \"That ain't me, just\r\nunderstand that, Father Ninepins.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you been doin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Skinny told me to bring my friend to you to work on the trucks.\"\r\n\r\nThe one whom she had addressed in this amiable manner was an old man with a\r\nwooden leg. He had lost his leg in the factory twelve years previous, hence\r\nhis nickname, \"Ninepins.\" He now had charge of a number of girls whom he\r\ntreated rudely, shouting and swearing at them. The working of these\r\nmachines needed as much attention of the eye as deftness of hand in lifting\r\nup the full spools and replacing them with empty ones, and fastening the\r\nbroken thread. He was convinced that if he did not shout and swear at them\r\nincessantly, emphasizing each curse with a stout bang of his wooden leg on\r\nthe floor, he would see his machines stop, which to him was intolerable.\r\nBut as he was a good man at heart, no one paid much attention to him, and\r\nbesides, the greater part of his cursing was lost in the noise of the\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and with it all, your machine has stopped,\" cried Rosalie\r\ntriumphantly, shaking her fist at him.\r\n\r\n\"Go on with you,\" he shouted back; \"that ain't my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\" he added, addressing Perrine.\r\n\r\nThis request, which she ought to have foreseen, for only the night before\r\nRosalie had asked the same question, made her start. As she did not wish to\r\ngive her real name, she stood hesitating. Old Ninepins thought that she had\r\nnot heard, and banging his wooden leg on the floor again, he cried:\r\n\r\n\"I asked you what your name was, didn't I? Eh?\"\r\n\r\nShe had time to collect herself and to recall the one that she had\r\nalready given to Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Aurelie,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Aurelie what?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"That is all ... just Aurelie,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Aurelie; come on with me,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe took her to a small truck stationed in a far corner and explained\r\nwhat she had to do, the same as Rosalie had.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand?\" he shouted several times.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\nAnd really what she had to do was so simple that she would indeed have\r\nbeen stupid if she had been unable to do it. She gave all her attention\r\nto the task, but every now and again old Ninepins called after her:\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't play on the way.\" But this was more to warn than to scold\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had no thought of playing, but as she pushed her truck with a good\r\nregular speed, while not stopping, she was able to see what was going on\r\non the way. One push started the truck, and all she had to do was to see\r\nthat there were no obstacles in its way.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon time each girl hurried to her home. Perrine went to the\r\nbaker's and got the baker to cut her a half a pound of bread, which she\r\nate as she walked the streets, smelling the while the good odor of the\r\nsoup which came from the open doors before which she passed. She walked\r\nslowly when she smelled a soup that she liked. She was rather hungry,\r\nand a half a pound of bread is not much, so it disappeared quickly.\r\n\r\nLong before the time for her to go back to work she was at the gates. She\r\nsat down on a bench in the shade of a tree and waited for the whistle,\r\nwatching the boys and girls playing, running and jumping. She was too timid\r\nto join in their games, although she would like to have done so.\r\n\r\nWhen Rosalie came she went back to her work with her.\r\n\r\nBefore the day was ended she was so tired that she did indeed merit\r\nNinepins' sharp rebuke.\r\n\r\n\"Go on! Can't you go faster than that?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nStartled by the bang from his wooden leg which accompanied his words, she\r\nstepped out like a horse under the lash of a whip, but only to slow up the\r\nmoment she was out of his sight. Her shoulders ached, her arms ached, her\r\nhead ached. At first it had seemed so easy to push the truck, but to have\r\nto keep at it all day was too much for her. All she wanted now was for the\r\nday to end. Why could she not do as much as the others? Some of them were\r\nnot so old as she, and yet they did not appear tired. Perhaps when she was\r\naccustomed to the work she would not feel so exhausted.\r\n\r\nShe reasoned thus as she wearily pushed her loaded truck, glancing at\r\nthe others with envy as they briskly went on with their work. Suddenly\r\nshe saw Rosalie, who was fastening some threads, fall down beside the\r\ngirl who was next to her. At the same time a girlish cry of anguish was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nThe machinery was stopped at once. All was silent now, the silence only\r\nbroken by a moan. Boys and girls, in fact everyone, hurried towards\r\nRosalie, despite the sharp words from old Ninepins. \"Thunder in Heaven,\r\nthe machines have stopped. What's the matter?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe girls crowded around Rosalie and lifted her to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" they asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's my hand,\" she murmured; \"I caught it in the machine. Oh!...\"\r\n\r\nHer face was very pale, her lips bloodless. Drops of blood were falling\r\nfrom her crushed hand. But upon examining it, it was found that only two\r\nfingers were hurt, one probably broken.\r\n\r\nNinepins, who at first had felt pity for the girl, now began pushing\r\nthose who surrounded her back to their places.\r\n\r\n\"Be off; go back to your work,\" he cried. \"A lot of fuss about nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it was a lot of fuss for nothing when you broke your leg, wasn't\r\nit?\" cried out a voice.\r\n\r\nHe glanced about to see who had spoken, but it was impossible to find\r\nout in the crowd. Then he shouted again:\r\n\r\n\"Get back to your work. Hurry up!\"\r\n\r\nSlowly they dispersed and Perrine, like the others, was on her way back\r\nto her truck, when Ninepins called to her:\r\n\r\n\"Here, you new one, there; come here! Come on, quicker than that.\"\r\n\r\nShe came back timidly, wondering why she was more guilty than the others\r\nwho had also left their work. But she found that he did not wish to\r\npunish her.\r\n\r\n\"Take that young fool there to the foreman,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What do you call me a fool for?\" cried Rosalie, raising her voice, for\r\nalready the machines were in motion. \"It wasn't my fault, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, it was your fault, clumsy.\" Then he added in a softer tone:\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very much,\" replied Rosalie bravely.\r\n\r\n\"Well, go on home; be off now.\"\r\n\r\nRosalie and Perrine went out together, Rosalie holding her wounded hand,\r\nwhich was the left, in her right hand.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you lean on me, Rosalie?\" asked little Perrine anxiously. \"I am\r\nsure it must be dreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm all right; thank you,\" said Rosalie. \"At least I can walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, it isn't much then, is it?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"One can't tell the first day. It's later that one suffers. I slipped,\r\nthat's how it happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have been getting tired,\" said Perrine, thinking of her own\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, it's always when one is tired that one is caught,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\"We are quick and sharp first thing in the morning. I wonder what Aunt\r\nZenobie will say!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it wasn't your fault,\" insisted Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" said Rosalie, ruefully. \"Grandmother will believe that,\r\nbut Aunt Zenobie won't. She'll say it's 'cause I don't want to work.\"\r\n\r\nOn their way through the building several men stopped them to ask what was\r\nthe matter. Some pitied Rosalie, but most of them listened indifferently,\r\nas though they were used to such accidents. They said that it was always\r\nso: one gets hurt the same as one falls sick; just a matter of chance, each\r\nin his turn, you today, and me tomorrow. But there were some who showed\r\nanger that such an accident could have occurred.\r\n\r\nThey came to a small outside building which was used for offices. They\r\nhad to mount some wide steps which led to a porch. Talouel was standing\r\non the porch, walking up and down with his hands in his pockets, his hat\r\non his head. He seemed to be taking a general survey, like a captain on\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter now?\" he cried, angrily, when he saw the two girls.\r\n\r\nRosalie showed him her bleeding hand.\r\n\r\n\"Wrap your paw up in your handkerchief then,\" he said, roughly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW?\" HE CRIED ANGRILY.]\r\n\r\nWith Perrine's aid she got her handkerchief out of her pocket. Talouel\r\nstrode up and down the porch. After the handkerchief had been twisted\r\naround the wounded hand he came over to poor Rosalie and stood towering\r\nabove her.\r\n\r\n\"Empty your pockets,\" he ordered. She looked at him, not understanding.\r\n\r\n\"I say, take everything out of your pockets,\" he said again.\r\n\r\nShe did what she was told, and drew from her pockets an assortment of\r\nthings--a whistle made from a nut, some bones, a thimble, a stick of\r\nliquorice, three cents, and a little mirror.\r\n\r\nThe bully at once seized the mirror.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I was sure of it,\" he cried. \"While you were looking at yourself in\r\nthe glass a thread broke and your spool stopped. You tried to catch the\r\ntime lost and that's how it happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not look in my glass,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! you're all the same. I know you. Now: what's the trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, but my hand is crushed,\" said poor Rosalie, trying to\r\nkeep back her tears.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what do you want me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father Ninepins told me to come to you,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"And you ... what's the matter with you?\" he asked, turning to Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" she replied, disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father Ninepins told her to bring me here,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, she can take you to Dr. Ruchon and let him see it. But I'm going\r\nto look into this matter and find out if it is your fault, and if it is\r\n... look out!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a loud, bullying voice which could be heard throughout the\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nAs the two girls were about to go M. Vulfran Paindavoine appeared,\r\nguiding himself with his hand along the wall.\r\n\r\n\"What's it all about, Talouel? What's the matter here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much, sir,\" replied the foreman. \"One of the girls has hurt her\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, Monsieur Vulfran,\" said Rosalie, going up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Mother Françoise's granddaughter, Rosalie, isn't it?\" asked\r\nthe blind man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's me, Monsieur Vulfran,\" said Rosalie, beginning to cry. Harsh\r\nwords had hardened her heart, but this tone of pity was too much for\r\npoor Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with your hand, my poor girl?\" asked the blind man.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, I think my two fingers are broken,\" she said, \"although I am\r\nnot in much pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why are you crying?\" asked M. Vulfran, tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Because you speak so kindly to me.\"\r\n\r\nTalouel shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Now go home at once,\" said M. Vulfran, \"and I'll send the doctor to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Write a note to Dr. Ruchon,\" he said, turning to Talouel, \"and tell him\r\nto call at Mother Françoise's house; say that the matter is urgent and\r\nhe must go there at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want anyone to go with you?\" he asked, addressing Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Monsieur Vulfran; I have a friend here with me,\" she\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"She can go with you then, and tell your grandmother that you will be\r\npaid while you are away.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Perrine now who felt like crying, but catching Talouel's glance,\r\nshe stiffened. It was not until they had passed out of the yard that she\r\nbetrayed her emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Monsieur Vulfran kind?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Rosalie; \"he would be all right if he were alone, but\r\nwith Skinny he can't be; he hasn't the time and he has a lot to think\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he seemed very kind to you,\" said little Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" Rosalie said, drawing herself up; \"I make him think of his\r\nson. My mother was Monsieur Edmond's foster sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he think of his son?\"\r\n\r\n\"He thinks of nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody came to their doors as Rosalie and Perrine passed. Rosalie's\r\nhandkerchief was covered with blood. Most of the people were merely\r\ncurious, others felt sorry, others were angry, knowing that what had\r\nhappened to this girl that day might happen the next day, at any moment,\r\nto their fathers, husbands, and children. Was not everyone in\r\nMaraucourt employed at the factory?\r\n\r\n\"You come on in with me,\" said Rosalie, when they reached the house;\r\n\"then perhaps Aunt Zenobie won't say much.\"\r\n\r\nBut Perrine's presence had no effect upon the terrible aunt. Seeing\r\nRosalie arrive at such an unusual hour, and noticing that her hand was\r\nwrapped up, she cried out shrilly: \"Now, then, you've gone and hurt\r\nyourself, you lazy bones. I bet you did it on purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm goin' to be paid,\" retorted Rosalie, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"You think so, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Vulfran told me that I should.\"\r\n\r\nBut this information did not appease Aunt Zenobie. She continued to\r\nscold until Mother Françoise, leaving her store, came to see what was\r\nthe matter. But the old grandmother, instead of showing anger, put her\r\narms about Rosalie and said: \"Oh, my dearie; you've gone and got hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a little, grandmother ... it's my fingers ... but it ain't much.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have Dr. Ruchon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Vulfran is going to send him here.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine was about to follow them into the house when Aunt Zenobie turned\r\nupon her and stopped her.\r\n\r\n\"What are you coming for?\" she asked. \"Do you think we need you to look\r\nafter her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for coming,\" called out Rosalie to Perrine.\r\n\r\nPerrine had nothing to do but to return to the factory, which she did.\r\nBut just as she reached the gates a whistle announced that it was\r\nclosing time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nNEW SHOES\r\n\r\n\r\nA dozen times during the day she had asked herself how she could\r\npossibly sleep in that room where she had been almost suffocated. She\r\nwas sure that she would not be able to sleep any better that night, or\r\nthe next, or the next.\r\n\r\nAnd if she could not find rest after a hard day's work, whatever would\r\nhappen to her?\r\n\r\nIn her little mind she weighed all the consequences of this terrible\r\nquestion. If she had not the strength to do her work she would be sent\r\naway from the factory, and that would be the end of all her hopes. She\r\nwould be ill and there would be no one to help her, and she would have\r\nto lie down at the foot of a tree and die.\r\n\r\nIt is true that unless she wished she was not obliged to occupy the bed\r\nthat she had paid for, but where would she find another, and what would\r\nshe say to Rosalie? How could she say in a nice way that what was good\r\nfor others was not good for her, and when they knew how disgusted she\r\nhad been, how would they treat her? She might create such ill feeling\r\nthat she would be forced to leave the factory.\r\n\r\nThe day had passed without her having come to a decision.\r\n\r\nBut now that Rosalie had hurt her hand the situation was changed. Poor\r\nRosalie would probably have to stay in bed for several days, and she\r\nwould not know what happened in the house at the end of the yard. She\r\nwould not know who slept in the room or who did not; consequently she\r\nneed fear no questions. And, on the other hand, as none of the girls in\r\nthe room knew who the new lodger for the night had been, neither would\r\nthey bother about her; it might very well be someone who had decided to\r\nfind a lodging elsewhere.\r\n\r\nReasoning thus, she decided quickly that she would go and sleep in her\r\nnew little home. How good it would be to sleep there--nothing to fear\r\nfrom anyone, a roof to cover her head, without counting the enjoyment of\r\nliving in a house of one's own.\r\n\r\nThe matter was quite decided, and after having been to the baker's to\r\nbuy another half a pound of bread for her supper, instead of returning\r\nto Mother Françoise's she again took the road that she had taken early\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\nShe slipped behind the hedge as the factory hands who lived outside\r\nMaraucourt came tramping along the road on their way home. She did not\r\nwish to be seen by them. While she waited for them to pass she gathered\r\na quantity of rushes and ferns and made a broom. Her new home was clean\r\nand comfortable, but with a little attention it could be made more so,\r\nand she would pick a lot of dried ferns and make a good soft bed to lie\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nForgetting her fatigue, she quickly tied the broom together with some\r\nwisps of straw and fastened it to a stick. No less quickly a bunch of\r\nferns was arranged in a mass so that she could easily carry them to her\r\nhut.\r\n\r\nThe road was now deserted as far as she could see. Hoisting the bed of\r\nferns on her back and taking the broom in her hands, she ran down the\r\nhill and across the road. When she came to the narrow path she had to\r\nslacken her speed, for the ferns caught in the branches and she could\r\nnot pass without going down on her knees.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at the island, she began at once to do her housework. She\r\nthrew away the old ferns, then commenced to sweep everywhere, the roof,\r\nthe walls and the ground.\r\n\r\nAs she looked out over the pond and saw the reeds growing thickly, a\r\nbright idea came to her. She needed some shoes. One does not go about a\r\ndeserted island in leather shoes. She knew how to plait, and she would\r\nmake a pair of soles with the reeds and get a little canvas for the tops\r\nand tie them on with ribbon.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had finished her sweeping she ran out to the pond and\r\npicked a quantity of the most flexible reeds and carried them back to\r\nthe door of her hut and commenced to work. But after she had made a\r\nplait of reeds about a yard long she found that this sole that she was\r\nmaking would be too light; because it was too hollow, there would be no\r\nsolidity, and that before plaiting the reeds they would have to undergo\r\na preparation which in crushing the fibres would transform them into\r\ncoarse strings.\r\n\r\nHowever, this did not stop her. Now she needed a hammer, of course she\r\ncould not find one, but what she did find was a big round stone, which\r\nserved her purpose very well indeed. Then she commenced to beat the\r\nreeds. Night came on while she was still at work, and she went to sleep\r\ndreaming of the beautiful sandals tied with blue ribbons which she would\r\nhave, for she did not doubt but that she would succeed with what she had\r\nundertaken ... if not the first time, well, then the second or the third\r\n... or the tenth.\r\n\r\nBy the next evening she had plaited enough to begin the soles, and the\r\nfollowing day, having bought a curved awl for the price of one sou, some\r\nthread for one sou, a piece of ribbon for the same price, a small piece\r\nof rough canvas for four sous, in all seven sous, which was all that she\r\ncould spend if she did not wish to go without bread on the Saturday, she\r\ntried to make a sole like those worn on shoes. The first one that she\r\nmade was almost round. This was not exactly the shape of the foot. The\r\nsecond one, to which she gave much more attention, seemed to resemble\r\nnothing at all; the third was a little better, but finally the fourth,\r\nwhich, with some practice, she had managed to tighten in the center and\r\ndraw in at the heel, could pass for a sole.\r\n\r\nOnce more she had proved that with a little perseverance, a little will,\r\none can do what one wants, even if at first it seems impossible. And she\r\nhad done this with scarcely anything, a few sous, with no tools, with\r\nhardly anything at her command. She was really very happy and she\r\nconsidered that her work was very successful.\r\n\r\nNow what she needed most to finish her sandals were scissors. They would\r\ncost so much to buy she would have to manage without them. Fortunately\r\nshe had her knife, and with the help of a stone to sharpen the point she\r\ncould make it fine enough to trim the canvas.\r\n\r\nBut the cutting of the pieces of canvas she found quite a difficult\r\nmatter. Finally she accomplished it, and on the following Saturday\r\nmorning she had the satisfaction of going forth shod in a nice pair of\r\ngray canvas shoes, tied with blue ribbons crossed over her stockings.\r\n\r\nWhile she had been working on her shoes (the work had taken four\r\nevenings and three mornings beginning at the break of day), she had\r\nwondered what she should do with her leather shoes while she was away\r\nfrom the hut. She had no fear that they would be stolen by anyone, for\r\nno one came to the place, but then the rats might eat them. So as to\r\nprevent this she would put them in a place where the rats could not get\r\nat them.\r\n\r\nThis was a rather difficult matter, for the rats seemed to be\r\neverywhere. She had no closet, no box to put them away in. Finally she\r\ntied them to the roof with some wisps of straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSTRANGE HOUSEKEEPING\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough she was very proud of her shoes, she was rather anxious as to\r\nhow she would conduct herself while wearing them at work. While she\r\nloaded her truck or pushed it along she was continually looking down at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nBy doing so she would probably attract the attention of the other girls.\r\nThis is exactly what did happen. Several of her comrades noticed them\r\nand complimented her.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you buy those shoes?\" one asked.\r\n\r\n\"They are not shoes; they are sandals,\" corrected Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"No, they are not; they are shoes,\" said the girl; \"but whatever they\r\nare they sure are pretty. Where did you buy them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I made them myself with plaited reeds and four cents worth of canvas,\"\r\nreplied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"They _are_ beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nThe success she had made of her shoes decided her to undertake another\r\ntask. She had thought several times of doing it, but it was much more\r\ndifficult, or so she thought, and might mean too much expense. She\r\nwanted to make a chemise to replace the only one which she possessed.\r\nFor it was very inconvenient to take off this only garment to wash it\r\nand then wait until it was dry to put it on again. She needed two yards\r\nof calico, and she wondered how much it would cost. And how would she\r\ncut the goods when she had them? These were very difficult questions to\r\nanswer. She certainly had something to think about.\r\n\r\nShe wondered if it would not be wiser to begin by making a print dress\r\nto replace her waist and skirt, which was worn more than ever now, as\r\nshe had to sleep in it. It could last a very little while longer. When\r\nit was finished, how would she go out? For her daily bread, as much as\r\nfor the success of her future plans, she must continue to be admitted to\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\nYet on the Saturday evening when she had the three francs in her hand\r\nwhich she had earned for the week's work, she could not resist the\r\ntemptation of a chemise. She still considered a waist and skirt of the\r\nutmost utility, but then a chemise also was indispensable, and besides\r\nthere were many arguments in favor of the chemise--cleanliness in which\r\nshe had been brought up, self-respect. Finally the chemise won the day.\r\nShe would mend her waist and skirt; as the material had formerly been\r\nvery strong, it would still hold a few more darns.\r\n\r\nEvery day at the luncheon hour she went to Mother Françoise's house to\r\nask news of Rosalie. Sometimes news was given to her, sometimes not,\r\naccording to whether it was the grandmother or the aunt whom she saw.\r\n\r\nOn her way to inquire for Rosalie she passed a little store which was\r\ndivided into two sections. On one side newspapers, pictures and songs\r\nwere sold, and on the other linens, calicos and prints. Perrine had\r\noften looked in this store. How nice it would be to go in and have them\r\ncut off as much material as she wished! Sometimes, when she had been\r\nlooking in the window, pretending to look at the newspapers or a song,\r\nshe had seen girls from the factory enter and come out shortly after\r\nwith parcels carefully wrapped up, which they held clasped tightly to\r\nthem. She had thought then that such pleasure was not for her ... at\r\nleast not then.\r\n\r\nNow she could enter the store if she wished, for she had three silver\r\ncoins in her hand. She went in.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you want, mademoiselle?\" asked a little old woman politely,\r\nwith a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\"Will you please tell me what is the price of calico the yard ... the\r\ncheapest?\" asked Perrine timidly.\r\n\r\n\"I have it at forty centimes the yard,\" said the old woman.\r\n\r\nPerrine gave a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Will you cut me two yards, please?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It won't wear very well ... but the sixty centimes....\"\r\n\r\n\"The forty centime one will do, thank you,\" said little Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"As you like,\" said the old woman. \"I wouldn't like you to come back\r\nafter and say....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wouldn't do that,\" interrupted Perrine hastily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE HAD SOME TIME AGO DECIDED ON THE SHAPE.]\r\n\r\nThe old woman cut off two yards, and Perrine noticed that it was not\r\nwhite nor shiny like the one she had admired in the window.\r\n\r\n\"Any more?\" asked the shopkeeper when she had torn the calico with a\r\nsharp, dry rip.\r\n\r\n\"I want some thread also,\" said Perrine; \"a spool of white, number\r\nforty.\"\r\n\r\nNow it was Perrine's turn to leave the store with her little newspaper\r\nparcel hugged tightly to her heart. Out of her three francs (sixty\r\ncentimes) she had spent eighteen, so there still remained forty-two\r\nuntil the following Saturday. She would have to spend twenty sous for\r\nbread, so that left her fourteen sous for extras.\r\n\r\nShe ran back all the way to her little island. When she reached her\r\ncabin she was out of breath, but that did not prevent her from beginning\r\nher work at once. She had some time ago decided upon the shape she would\r\ngive her chemise. She would make it quite straight, first, because that\r\nwas the simplest and the easiest way for one who had never cut out\r\nanything before and who had no scissors, and secondly, because she could\r\nuse the string that was in her old one for this new one.\r\n\r\nEverything went very well; to begin with, there was no cutting in the\r\nstraight piece. Perhaps there was nothing to admire in her work but at\r\nany rate she did not have to do it over again. But when the time came\r\nfor shaping the openings for the head and arms then she experienced\r\ndifficulties! She had only a knife to do the cutting and she was so\r\nafraid that she would tear the calico. With a trembling hand she took\r\nthe risk. At last it was finished, and on Tuesday morning she would be\r\nable to go to the factory wearing a chemise earned by her own work, cut\r\nand sewn by her own hands.\r\n\r\nThat day when she went to Mother Françoise's; it was Rosalie who came to\r\nmeet her with her arm in a sling.\r\n\r\n\"Are you better?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"No, but they let me get up and they said that I could come out in the\r\nyard,\" replied Rosalie.\r\n\r\nPerrine was very pleased to see her friend again and asked all kinds of\r\nquestions, but Rosalie seemed rather reserved. Perrine could not\r\nunderstand this attitude.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you living now?\" asked Rosalie.\r\n\r\nFearing to say where, Perrine evaded a direct answer to this question.\r\n\r\n\"It was too expensive for me here,\" she said, \"and I had so little money\r\nleft for food and other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, did you find anything cheaper elsewhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!...\"\r\n\r\nShe looked narrowly at Perrine, then her curiosity got the better of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you with?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nAgain Perrine could not give a direct answer.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you that later,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, when you like,\" replied Rosalie carelessly, \"only let me tell you\r\nthis, if you see Aunt Zenobie in the yard or at the door you had better\r\nnot come in. She doesn't want to see you here. If you come it is better\r\nto come in the evening, then she ... she is busy.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine went to the factory very saddened by this welcome. What had she\r\ndone that she could not go into the house? All day long she remained\r\nunder the impression that she had offended them. When evening came and\r\nshe found herself alone in the cabin having nothing to do for the first\r\ntime in eight days, she was even more depressed. Then she thought that\r\nshe would go and walk in the fields that surrounded her little island,\r\nfor she had not yet had time to do this.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful evening. She wandered around the pond, walking in the\r\nhigh grass that had not been trodden by anyone. She looked across the\r\nwater at her little home which seemed almost hidden amongst the trees.\r\nThe birds and beasts could not suspect that it was the work of man\r\nbehind which he could lie in ambush with his gun.\r\n\r\nAt that moment she heard a noise at her feet which frightened her and a\r\nwater hen jumped into the water, terrified. Then looking about her she\r\nsaw a nest made of grass and feathers in which were ten white eggs,\r\ndirty little eggs with small dark spots.\r\n\r\nInstead of being placed on the ground amongst the grass the nest was\r\nfloating on the water. She examined it but without touching it, and\r\nnoticed that it was made in a way to go up and down according to the\r\nflow of the water, and was so surrounded with reeds that neither the\r\ncurrent nor the wind could carry it away.\r\n\r\nThe mother hen, anxious, took up her position at a distance and stayed\r\nthere. Perrine hid herself in the high grass and waited to see if she\r\nwould come back to her nest.\r\n\r\nAs she did not return, she went on with her walk, and again and again\r\nthe rustling of her dress frightened other birds. The water hens, so\r\nlissom in their escape, ran to the floating leaves of the water lilies\r\nwithout going under. She saw birds everywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen an hour later she returned to her little home the hut was hidden\r\nhalf in the shadows of night. It was so quiet and pretty she thought,\r\nand how pleased she was that she had shown as much intelligence as these\r\nbirds ... to make her nest here.\r\n\r\nWith Perrine, as with many little children, it was the events of the day\r\nwhich shaped her dreams by night. The unhappiness through which she had\r\npassed the last few months had often colored her dreams, and many times\r\nsince her troubles had commenced, she had awakened in the night with the\r\nperspiration pouring off her. Her sleep was disturbed with nightmares\r\ncaused by the miseries she had experienced in the day.\r\n\r\nNow since she had been at Maraucourt and had new hopes and was at work,\r\nthe nightmares had been less frequent and so she was not so sad.\r\n\r\nNow she thought of what she was going to do at the factory the next day,\r\nof the skirt and waist that she would make, of her underwear.\r\n\r\nNow on this particular evening after she had wandered over the fields\r\nsurrounding her home and had entered her little nest to go to sleep,\r\nstrange visions passed before her sleepy eyes. She thought that she was\r\nwalking about the field exploring, and came upon a great big kitchen, a\r\nwonderful kitchen like in castles, and there were a number of little\r\ndwarfs of the most diabolical shapes, sitting around a big table before\r\na blazing fire; some of them were breaking eggs, others were beating\r\nthem up until they were white and frothy; and some of these eggs were as\r\nlarge as melons and others were as small as a little pea, and the dwarfs\r\nmade the most extraordinary dishes from them. They seemed to know the\r\nevery kind of dish that could be made with eggs,--boiled eggs with\r\ncheese and butter; with tomatoes; poached; fried eggs; various omelettes\r\nwith ham and kidney, jam or rum; the rum set afire and flaming with\r\nsparkling lights. And then there were more important dishes still which\r\nonly the head cooks were handling ... pastries and delicious creams.\r\n\r\nNow and again she half woke and she tried to banish the stupid dream\r\nbut it came again and the elfs still went on doing their fantastic work,\r\nso that when the factory whistle sounded she was still watching them\r\nprepare some chocolate creams which she could almost taste in her mouth.\r\n\r\nThen she knew that what had impressed her most during her walk was not\r\nthe beauty of the night but simply those eggs which she had seen in the\r\nnest, which had told her stomach that for fourteen days she had eaten\r\nonly bread and water. These eggs had made her dream of the elfs and all\r\nthose delicious things that they were making; she was hungry for good\r\nthings and she had found it out through her dream.\r\n\r\nWhy had she not taken those eggs, or at least some of them, they did not\r\nbelong to anyone for the duck was wild? Of course as she had no saucepan\r\nor frying pan or any kitchen utensils whatever, she could not prepare\r\nany of the dishes that she had seen made before her dream eyes. But\r\nthere, that was the best about eggs, they could be used without any very\r\nskillful preparation; a lighted match put to a little heap of dry wood\r\nand then she could cook them hard or soft, how she liked, in the hot\r\nashes. And she would buy a saucepan or a pan as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSeveral times this idea came to her while she was at work that day until\r\nfinally she decided to buy a box of matches and a cent's worth of salt.\r\nAs soon as she had made her purchases she ran back to her hut.\r\n\r\nShe had been too interested in the place where she had discovered the\r\nnest not to be able to find it again. The mother was not occupying the\r\nnest but she had been there during the day because Perrine saw now that\r\ninstead of ten eggs there were eleven, which proved that she had not\r\nfinished laying.\r\n\r\nHere was a good chance for her to help herself. In the first place the\r\neggs were fresh, and then if she only took five or six, the duck, who\r\ndid not know how to count, would not notice that any one had been there.\r\n\r\nA short time ago Perrine would not have had any scruples and she would\r\nhave quickly emptied the nest, without a thought, but the sorrows that\r\nshe had experienced had made her very thoughtful for the griefs of\r\nothers; in this same manner her love for Palikare had made her feel an\r\naffection for all animals that she had not known in her early childhood.\r\n\r\nAfter she had taken the eggs she wondered where she could cook them;\r\nnaturally this could not be done in the cabin for the slightest wreath\r\nof smoke which would emerge from it would indicate to anyone who saw it\r\nthat someone was living there.\r\n\r\nThere was a gypsy camp quite near which she passed by to get to her\r\nisland, and a little smoke coming from there would attract no attention.\r\n\r\nShe quickly got together some wood and lighted it; soon she had a fire\r\nin the ashes of which she cooked one of her eggs. She lacked an egg cup\r\nbut what did that matter? A little hole made in a piece of bread could\r\nhold the egg. In a few minutes she had the satisfaction of dipping a\r\npiece of bread in her egg, which was cooked to perfection. It seemed to\r\nher as she took the first mouthful that she had never eaten anything so\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished her supper she wondered how she should use the\r\nremainder of her eggs. She would have to use them sparingly for she\r\nmight not be able to get any more for a long time. A hot soup with an\r\negg broken into it would be very good.\r\n\r\nAs the idea of having some soup came into her head, it was almost\r\nimmediately followed by the regret that she could not have it. The\r\nsuccess of her canvas shoes and her underwear had inspired her with a\r\ncertain amount of confidence. She had proved that one can do a great\r\ndeal if one perseveres, but she had not enough confidence to imagine\r\nthat she could ever make a saucepan for her soup or a metal or wooden\r\nspoon, and if she waited until she had the money required to buy these\r\nutensils, she would have to content herself with the smell of the soup\r\nthat came to her as she passed by the open doors.\r\n\r\nShe was telling herself this as she went to work, but just before she\r\nreached the village she saw a heap of rubbish by the side of the road\r\nand amongst the debris she noticed some tin cans which had been used for\r\npotted meat, fish and vegetables. There were different shapes, some\r\nlarge, some small, some high, some low.\r\n\r\nNoticing how shiny they were on the surface, she instinctively stopped;\r\nshe had not a moment's hesitation. The saucepans, dishes, forks, spoons\r\nwhich she lacked were all here; she could have a whole array of kitchen\r\nutensils; she had only to make her choice. With a bound she was across\r\nthe road; quickly picking out four cans she ran back and hid them behind\r\na hedge so that when evening came she would be able to find them.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came she found her treasures and made for her home.\r\n\r\nShe did not wish to make a noise on her island any more than she wished\r\nsmoke to be seen, so at the end of her day's work she went to her\r\ngypsy's camp hoping that she might find a tool or something that would\r\nserve her for a hammer with which to flatten the tins that were to be\r\nused for plates, saucepans, spoons, etc.\r\n\r\nShe found that it was a very difficult task to make a spoon. It took her\r\nno less than three days to do so, and when it was done, she was not at\r\nall sure that if she had shown it to anyone, he would have recognized it\r\nfor a spoon. But she had made something that served her purpose, that\r\nwas enough; besides, she ate alone and there would be no one to notice\r\nher utensils.\r\n\r\nNow for the soup for which she longed! All she wanted was butter and\r\nsorrel. She would have to buy butter and naturally as she couldn't make\r\nmilk she would have to buy that also.\r\n\r\nThe sorrel she would find wild in the fields and she could also find\r\nwild carrots and oyster plants. They were not so good as the cultivated\r\nvegetables but they would suit her very well indeed.\r\n\r\nShe not only had eggs and vegetables for her dinner, and her pots and\r\npans, but there were fish in the pond and if she were sharp enough to\r\ncatch them she would have fish too.\r\n\r\nShe needed a line and some worms. She had a long piece of string left over\r\nfrom the piece she had bought for her shoes and she had only to spend one\r\nsou for some hooks, then with a piece of horse hair she could pick up\r\noutside the blacksmith's door, she would have a line good enough to catch\r\nseveral kinds of fish; if the best in the pond passed disdainfully before\r\nher simple bait then she would have to be satisfied with little ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA BANQUET IN THE HUT\r\n\r\n\r\nPerrine was so busy of an evening that she let an entire week pass\r\nbefore she again went to see Rosalie. However, one of the girls at the\r\nfactory who lodged with Mother Françoise had brought her news of her\r\nfriend. Perrine, as well as being busy, had been afraid that she might\r\nsee that terrible Aunt Zenobie and so she had let the days pass.\r\n\r\nThen one evening after work she thought that she would not return at\r\nonce to her little island. She had no supper to prepare. The night\r\nbefore she had caught some fish and cooked it, and she intended to have\r\nit cold for her supper that evening.\r\n\r\nRosalie was alone in the garden sitting under an apple tree. When she\r\nsaw Perrine she came to the gate, half pleased, half annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"I thought that you were not coming any more,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I've been very busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What with?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine showed Rosalie her shoes. Then she told her how she had made\r\nherself a chemise and the trouble she had had in cutting it.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you borrow a pair of scissors from the people in your house?\"\r\nasked Rosalie in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"There is no one in my house who could lend me scissors,\" replied\r\nPerrine.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody has scissors!\"\r\n\r\nPerrine wondered if she ought to keep her abode a secret any longer. She\r\nwas afraid that if she did so she might offend Rosalie, so she decided\r\nto tell her.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody lives in my house,\" she said smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever do you mean?\" asked Rosalie with round eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That's so, and that's why, as I wasn't able to borrow a saucepan to cook\r\nmy soup in and a spoon to eat it with, I had to make them and I can tell\r\nyou that it was harder for me to make my spoon than to make my shoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're joking!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, really.\"\r\n\r\nThen she told her everything, how she had taken possession of the cabin,\r\nand made her own cooking utensils, and about her search for eggs, and\r\nhow she fished and cooked in the gypsy's camping ground.\r\n\r\nRosalie's eyes opened wider still in wonder and delight. She seemed to\r\nbe listening to a wonderful story.\r\n\r\nWhen Perrine told her how she made her first sorrel soup, she clapped\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how delicious! How you must have enjoyed it!\" she cried. \"What\r\nfun!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, everything is great fun when things go right,\" said Perrine; \"but\r\nwhen things won't go! I worked three days for my spoon. I couldn't scoop it\r\nout properly. I spoiled two large pieces of tin and had only one left. And\r\nmy! how I banged my fingers with the stones that I had to use in place of a\r\nhammer!\"\r\n\r\n\"But your soup, that's what I'm thinking of,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was good.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said Perrine, \"there's sorrel and carrots, watercress, onions,\r\nparsnips, turnips, and ever so many things to eat that one can find in the\r\nfields. They are not quite the same as the cultivated vegetables, but they\r\nare good!\"\r\n\r\n\"One ought to know that!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my father who taught me to know them.\"\r\n\r\nRosalie was silent for a moment, then she said:\r\n\r\n\"Would you like me to come and see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should love to have you if you'll promise not to tell anyone where I\r\nlive,\" said Perrine, delightedly.\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" said Rosalie, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, when will you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday I am going to see one of my aunts at Saint-Pipoy; on my way\r\nback in the afternoon I can stop....\"\r\n\r\nPerrine hesitated for a moment, then she said amiably:\r\n\r\n\"Do better than just call; stay to dinner with me.\"\r\n\r\nRosalie, like the real peasant that she was, began to reply vaguely in\r\na ceremonious fashion, neither saying yes nor no; but it was quite plain\r\nto see that she wished very much to accept the invitation. Perrine\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n\"Do come; I shall be so pleased,\" she said. \"I am so lonesome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, really....\" began Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dine with me; that is settled,\" said Perrine, brightly; \"but you\r\nmust bring your own spoon, because I shall not have the time nor the tin\r\nto make another one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I bring my bread also? I can....\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would. I'll wait for you in the gypsy's ground. You'll find\r\nme doing my cooking.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine was very pleased at the thought of receiving a guest in her own\r\nhome ... there was a menu to compose, provisions to find ... what an\r\naffair! She felt quite important. Who would have said a few days before\r\nthat she would be able to offer dinner to a friend!\r\n\r\nBut there was a serious side. Suppose she could not find any eggs or\r\ncatch a fish! Her menu then would be reduced to sorrel soup only. What a\r\ndinner!\r\n\r\nBut fortune favored her. On Friday evening she found some eggs. True,\r\nthey were only water-hen's eggs, and not so large as the duck's eggs,\r\nbut then she must not be too particular. And she was just as lucky with\r\nher fishing. With a red worm on the end of her line, she managed to\r\ncatch a fine perch, which was quite sufficient to satisfy hers and\r\nRosalie's appetite. Yet, however, she wanted a dessert, and some\r\ngooseberries growing under a weeping willow furnished it. True, they\r\nwere not quite ripe, but the merit of this fruit is that you can eat it\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nWhen, late Sunday afternoon, Rosalie arrived at the gypsy camping\r\nground, she found Perrine seated before her fire upon which the soup was\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\n\"I waited for you to mix the yolk of an egg in the soup,\" said Perrine.\r\n\"You have only to turn it with your free hand while I gently pour the\r\nsoup over it; the bread is soaked.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Rosalie had dressed herself specially for this dinner, she was\r\nnot afraid to help. This was play, and it all seemed very amusing to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSoon the soup was ready, and it only had to be carried across to the\r\nisland. This Perrine did.\r\n\r\nThe cabin door was open, and Rosalie could see before she entered that\r\nthe place was filled with flowers. In each corner were grouped, in\r\nartistic showers, wild roses, yellow iris, cornflowers, and poppies, and\r\nthe floor was entirely covered with a beautiful soft green moss.\r\n\r\nRosalie's exclamations of delight amply repaid Perrine for all the\r\ntrouble she had taken.\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful! Oh, isn't it pretty!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nOn a bed of fresh ferns two large flat leaves were placed opposite each\r\nother; these were to serve for plates; and on a very much larger leaf,\r\nlong and narrow, which is as it should be for a dish, the perch was\r\nplaced, garnished with a border of watercress. Another leaf, but very\r\nsmall, served as a salt-cellar, also another holding the dessert.\r\nBetween each dish was a white anemone, its pure whiteness standing out\r\ndazzlingly against the fresh verdure.\r\n\r\n\"If you will sit down....\" said Perrine, extending her hand. And when\r\nthey had taken their seats opposite one another the dinner commenced.\r\n\r\n\"How sorry I should have been if I hadn't have come,\" said Rosalie,\r\nspeaking with her mouth full; \"it is so pretty and so good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't you have come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they wanted to send me to Picquigny for Mr. Bendit; he is ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's got typhoid fever. He's very ill. Since yesterday he hasn't known\r\nwhat he's been talking about, and he doesn't know anybody. And I had an\r\nidea about you....\"\r\n\r\n\"Me! What about me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something you can do....\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is anything I can do for Mr. Bendit I'd be only too willing.\r\nHe was kind to me; but I'm only a poor girl; I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a little more fish and some more watercress, and I'll explain,\"\r\nsaid Rosalie. \"You know that Mr. Bendit has charge of the foreign\r\ncorrespondence; he translates the English and German letters. Naturally, as\r\nhe is off his head now, he can't translate. They wanted to get somebody\r\nelse to replace him, but as this other man might take his place after he\r\nis better (that is, if he does get better), M. Fabry and M. Mombleux have\r\ntaken charge of the work, so that he will be sure to have his job when he's\r\nup again. But now M. Fabry has been sent away to Scotland and M. Mombleux\r\nis in a fix, because, although he can read German all right, he's not much\r\non English. If the writing isn't very clear he can't make out the letters\r\nat all. I heard him saying so at the table when I was waiting on them. So I\r\nthought I'd tell him that you can speak English just as good as you can\r\nFrench.\"\r\n\r\n\"I spoke French with my father, and English with my mother,\" said\r\nPerrine, \"and when we were all three talking together we spoke sometimes\r\none, sometimes the other, mixing two languages without paying\r\nattention.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't sure whether I should say anything about you or not, but now I\r\nwill, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes; do, if you think a poor girl like me could be of any use to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't a question of being a poor girl or a young lady; it's a\r\nquestion of knowing English,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"I speak it, but to translate a business letter is another thing,\" said\r\nPerrine, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be all right with M. Mombleux; he knows the business part.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, tell him I shall be very pleased if I can do anything for\r\nM. Bendit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell him.\"\r\n\r\nThe perch, although a large one, had all been eaten, and all the\r\nwatercress had disappeared. It was now time for the dessert. Perrine got\r\nup and replaced the fish plates with smaller leaf plates in the shape of\r\na cup; she had picked the prettiest, with variegated shades, and marked\r\nas exquisitely as enameled ware. Then she offered her guest the\r\ngooseberries.\r\n\r\n\"Let me offer you some fruit from my own garden,\" she said, laughing, as\r\nthough she were playing at keeping doll's house.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your garden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over your head. There is a gooseberry bush growing in the branches of\r\nthis willow tree which holds up the cabin, so it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know you won't be able to live in here much longer,\" said Rosalie.\r\n\r\n\"Until the winter, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until winter! Why, the bird catchers will need this place pretty soon;\r\nthat I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! ... Oh, dear ... Oh, dear!\"\r\n\r\nThe day, which had begun so brightly for Perrine, ended sadly. That\r\nnight was certainly the worst Perrine had passed since she had been on\r\nher little island.\r\n\r\nWhere should she go?\r\n\r\nAnd all her utensils that she had taken such trouble to make; what\r\nshould she do with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nAURELIE'S CHANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Rosalie had not spoken to Perrine of the near opening of the shooting\r\nseason for water fowl, Perrine would have stayed on in her cabin unaware\r\nof the danger that might come to her. Although this news came as a blow\r\nto her, what Rosalie had said about M. Bendit and the translations she\r\nmight do for M. Mombleux gave her something else to think about.\r\n\r\nYes, her island was charming, and it would be a great grief for her to\r\nleave it. And yet here was an opportunity where she could be useful to\r\ntwo valued employés at the factory, and this step would lead to other\r\nsteps, and it would open doors perhaps through which she could pass\r\nlater. This was something that she should consider above all else, even\r\nabove the sorrow of being dispossessed of her little kingdom. It was not\r\nfor this game--robbing nests, catching fish, picking flowers, listening\r\nto the birds sing--that she had endured all the misery and fatigue of\r\nher long journey. She had an object in view. She must remember what her\r\nmother told her to do, and do it.\r\n\r\nShe had told Rosalie that she would call at Mother Françoise's house on\r\nMonday to see if Mombleux had need of her services. Rosalie came to\r\nmeet her and said that as no letters had come from England that Monday,\r\nthere would not be any translations to make that day, but perhaps there\r\nwould be something for the next day. This was at the luncheon hour, so\r\nPerrine returned to the factory. It had just struck two when Ninepin\r\nhopped up to her on his wooden leg and told her that she was wanted at\r\nthe offices at once.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" she asked in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"What's that to do with me? They just sent word for you to go to the\r\noffice ... go on,\" he said, roughly.\r\n\r\nShe hurried off. She could not understand. If it was a matter of helping\r\nMombleux with a translation, why should she have to go to the office,\r\nwhere everyone could see her and know that he had had to ask for her\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\nShe quickly went up the steps, where she saw Talouel standing outside\r\nwaiting for her.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the girl who speaks English?\" he asked. \"Now, no lies, 'cause\r\nyou speak French without an accent.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother was English and my father was French,\" replied Perrine, \"so I\r\nspeak both languages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. You are to go to Saint-Pipoy. Monsieur Paindavoine wants you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was so surprised at this news that she stood staring at the manager\r\nin amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Well, stupid?\" he said.\r\n\r\nAs though to excuse herself, she said:\r\n\r\n\"I was taken aback. I'm a stranger here and I don't know where\r\nSaint-Pipoy is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't be lost; you are to go in the carriage,\" said the manager.\r\n\"Here, William....\"\r\n\r\nM. Paindavoine's horse and carriage, which had been standing in the\r\nshade, now drew up.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the girl,\" said the manager to a young man. \"Take her to M.\r\nPaindavoine quickly.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine was already down the steps, and was about to take her seat\r\nbeside William when he stopped her with a sign of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Not here; take the back seat,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThere was a narrow seat for one person at the back. She got up into it\r\nand they started off at a brisk trot.\r\n\r\nWhen they had left the village behind William, slacking the horse's\r\nspeed, turned round to Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to have a chance to please the boss,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"He's got some English mechanics come over to put a machine together,\r\nand they can't understand each other. He's got M. Mombleux there, who\r\nsays he can speak English, but if he does it isn't the same English as\r\nthese Englishmen speak. They keep on jabbering, but don't seem to\r\nunderstand, and the boss is mad. It makes you split your sides to hear\r\n'em. At last M. Mombleux couldn't go on any longer, and to calm the boss\r\nhe said that he knew of a girl named Aurelie in the factory who spoke\r\nEnglish, and the boss made me come off at once for you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence; then he turned round again to Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"If you speak English like M. Mombleux,\" he said mockingly, \"perhaps\r\nit'd be better if you didn't go any farther.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I put you down?\" he added with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"You can go on,\" said Perrine, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was just thinking for you; that's all,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; but I wish to go on, please.\"\r\n\r\nYet in spite of her apparent coolness, little Perrine was very nervous,\r\nbecause, although she was sure of her English, she did not know what\r\nsort of English the engineer spoke. As William had said mockingly, it\r\nwas not the same that M. Mombleux understood. And she fully realized\r\nthat there would be many technical words that she would not be able to\r\ntranslate. She would not understand, and she would hesitate, and then\r\nprobably M. Paindavoine would be angry with her, the same as he had been\r\nwith M. Mombleux.\r\n\r\nAbove the tops of the poplars she could already see the great smoking\r\nchimneys of the factories of Saint-Pipoy. She knew that spinning and\r\nweaving were done here, the same as at Maraucourt, and, besides that, it\r\nwas here that they manufactured red rope and string. But whether she\r\nknew that or not, it was nothing that would help her in the task before\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThey turned the bend of the road. With a sweeping glance she could take\r\nin all the great buildings, and although these works were not so large\r\nas those of Maraucourt, they were nevertheless of considerable\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe carriage passed through the great iron gates and soon stopped before\r\nthe main office.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me,\" said William.\r\n\r\nHe led her into an office where M. Paindavoine was seated talking to the\r\nmanager of the Saint-Pipoy works.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the girl, sir,\" said William, holding his hat in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; you can go,\" said his master.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking to Perrine, M. Paindavoine made a sign to his manager\r\nto come nearer to him. Then he spoke to him in a low voice. The manager\r\nalso dropped his voice to answer. But Perrine's hearing was keen, and\r\nshe understood that they were speaking of her. She heard the manager\r\nreply: \"A young girl, about twelve or thirteen, who looks intelligent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come here, my child,\" said M. Paindavoine, in the same tone that she\r\nhad already heard him use to Rosalie, and which was very different from\r\nthat which he used for his employés.\r\n\r\nShe felt encouraged and went up to him.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Aurelie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are your father and mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are both dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been in my employ?\"\r\n\r\n\"For three weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just come from Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak English?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother was English, and I can speak in conversation, and I understand,\r\nbut....\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no 'buts'; you know or you do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the words used in various trades, because they use words that\r\nI have never heard, and I don't know the meaning of them,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Benoist,\" said M. Paindavoine quickly; \"what this little girl\r\nsays is so; that shows she is not stupid.\"\r\n\r\n\"She looks anything but that,\" answered Benoist.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps we shall be able to manage somehow,\" said M. Vulfran. He\r\ngot up, and placing one arm on the manager, he leaned on his cane with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\"Follow us, little girl,\" he said.\r\n\r\nPerrine usually had her eyes about her and noticed everything that\r\nhappened, but she took no heed where she was going. As she followed in\r\nher grandfather's footsteps, she was plunged in thought. What would be\r\nthe result of this interview with the English mechanics?\r\n\r\nThey came to a big red brick building. Here she saw Mombleux walking\r\nback and forth, evidently in a bad humor, and it seemed to her that he\r\nthrew her anything but a friendly look.\r\n\r\nThey went in and were taken up to the first floor. Here in a big hall\r\nstood a number of wooden crates bearing a firm's name, \"Morton and\r\nPratt, Manchester.\" On one of the crates the Englishmen were sitting,\r\nwaiting. Perrine noticed that from their dress they had every appearance\r\nof being gentlemen, and she hoped that she would be able better to\r\nunderstand them than if they had been rough workingmen. When M. Vulfran\r\nentered they rose.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them that you can speak English and that they can explain to you,\"\r\nsaid M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\nShe did what she was told, and at the first words she had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing the Englishmen's faces brighten. It is true she only spoke a few\r\nwords to begin the conversation, but the pleasant smile they gave her\r\nbanished all her nervousness.\r\n\r\n\"They understand her perfectly,\" said the manager.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, ask them,\" said M. Vulfran, \"why they have come a week\r\nearlier than the date arranged for their coming, because it so happens\r\nthat the engineer who was to direct them in their work, and who speaks\r\nEnglish, is away for a few days.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine translated the phrase accurately, and one of the men answered at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"They say,\" she said, \"that they have been to Cambrai and put up some\r\nmachinery, and they got through with their work quicker than they thought\r\nthey would, so they came here direct instead of going back to England and\r\nreturning again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose machinery were they working on at Cambrai?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"It was for the M. M. and E. Aveline and Company.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were the machines?\"\r\n\r\nThe question was put and the reply was given in English, but Perrine\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you hesitate?\" asked M. Vulfran, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Because it's a word used in the business that I don't know,\" answered\r\nPerrine, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Say the word in English.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hydraulic mangle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said M. Vulfran. He repeated the word in English,\r\nbut with quite a different accent from the English mechanics, which\r\nexplains why he had not understood them when they had spoken the words.\r\n\r\n\"You see that Aveline and Company are ahead of us,\" he said, turning to\r\nhis manager. \"We have no time to lose. I am going to cable to Fabry to\r\nreturn at once; but while waiting we must persuade these young men to\r\nget to work. Ask them what they are standing there for, little girl.\"\r\n\r\nShe translated the question, and the one who seemed to be the chief gave\r\nher a long answer.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"They are saying some things that are very difficult for me to understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"However, try and explain to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that the floor is not strong enough to hold their machine,\r\nwhich weighs....\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped to question the workmen in English, who told her the weight.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is it, is it?\" said M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"And when the machine is started going its weight will break the\r\nflooring,\" she continued, turning to M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"The beams are sixty centimetres in width.\"\r\n\r\nShe told the men what M. Vulfran said, listened to their reply, then\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"They say that they have examined the flooring, and that it is not safe\r\nfor this machine. They want a thorough test made and strong supports\r\nplaced under the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"The supports can be placed there at once, and when Fabry returns a\r\nthorough examination will be made. Tell them that. Let them get to work\r\nwithout losing a moment. They can have all the workmen they need ...\r\ncarpenters and masons, millwrights. They have only to tell you. You have\r\nto be at their service, and then you tell Monsieur Benoist what they\r\nrequire.\"\r\n\r\nShe translated these instructions to the men, who appeared satisfied\r\nwhen she told them that she was to stay and interpret for them.\r\n\r\n\"You will stay here,\" continued M. Vulfran. \"Your food will be given to\r\nyou and also a lodging at the inn. You will have nothing to pay there.\r\nAnd if we are pleased with you, you will receive something extra when\r\nMonsieur Fabry returns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nGRANDFATHER'S INTERPRETER\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was an interpreter; that was far better than pushing trucks. When\r\nthe day's work was over, acting in the capacity of interpreter, she\r\nescorted the two Englishmen to the village inn and engaged a room for\r\nthem and one for herself, not a miserable garret where she would have to\r\nsleep with several others, but a real bedroom all to herself. As they\r\ncould not speak one word of French, the two Englishmen asked her if she\r\nwould not take her dinner with them. They ordered a dinner that would\r\nhave been enough for ten men.\r\n\r\nThat night she slept in a real bed and between real sheets, yet it was a\r\nvery long time before she could get to sleep. Even when her eyelids grew\r\ntoo heavy to keep open her excitement was so great that every now and\r\nthen she would start up in bed. She tried to force herself to be calm.\r\nShe told herself that things would have to take their course, without\r\nher wondering all the time if she were going to be happy or not. That\r\nwas the only sensible thing to do. Things seemed to be taking such a\r\nfavorable turn she must wait. But the best arguments when addressed to\r\noneself have never made anyone go to sleep, and the better the argument\r\nthe more likely one is to keep awake.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when the factory whistle blew, she went to the door of\r\nthe room occupied by the two machinists and knocked, and told them it\r\nwas time to get up.\r\n\r\nThey paid no heed to the whistle, however, and it was not until they had\r\ntaken a bath and made an elaborate _toilette_, something unknown to the\r\nvillagers in those parts, and partaken of a hearty breakfast, consisting\r\nof a thick, juicy steak, plenty of buttered toast and several cups of\r\ntea, that they showed any readiness to get to their work.\r\n\r\nPerrine, who had discreetly waited for them outside, wondered if they\r\nwould ever be ready. When at last they came out, and she tripped behind\r\nthem to the factory, her one thought was that her grandfather would\r\nsurely be there ahead of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not until the afternoon that M. Vulfran arrived. He was\r\naccompanied by his youngest nephew, Casimir.\r\n\r\nThe youth looked disdainfully at the work the machinists had done, which\r\nin truth was merely in preparation.\r\n\r\n\"These fellows won't do much before Fabry returns,\" he said. \"That's not\r\nsurprising considering the supervision you have given them, uncle.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this jeeringly, but instead of taking his words lightly, his\r\nuncle reprimanded him severely: \"If you had been able to attend to this\r\nmatter, I should not have been forced to have called in this little\r\ngirl, who until now has only pushed trucks.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine saw Casimir bite his lip in anger, but he controlled himself and\r\nsaid lightly: \"If I had foreseen that I should have to give up a\r\ngovernment position for a commercial one, I should certainly have\r\nlearned English in preference to German.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is never too late to learn,\" replied his uncle in a tone that\r\nbrooked no further parley.\r\n\r\nThe quick words on both sides had been spoken in evident displeasure.\r\n\r\nPerrine had made herself as small as possible. She had not dared move,\r\nbut Casimir did not even turn his eyes in her direction, and almost at\r\nonce he went out, giving his arm to his uncle. Then she was able to give\r\nfree rein to her thoughts. How severe M. Vulfran was with his nephew,\r\nbut what a disagreeable, horrid youth was that nephew! If they had any\r\naffection for one another it certainly was not apparent. Why was it? Why\r\nwasn't this nephew kind to his old uncle, who was blind and broken down\r\nwith sorrow? And why was the old man so hard with a nephew who was\r\ntaking the place of his own son?\r\n\r\nWhile she was pondering these questions M. Vulfran returned, this time\r\nbeing led in by the manager, who, having placed him in a seat, began to\r\nexplain to him the work that the machinists were now engaged upon.\r\n\r\nSome minutes later she heard M. Benoist calling: \"Aurelie! Aurelie!\"\r\n\r\nShe did not move, for she had forgotten that Aurelie was the name that\r\nshe had given to herself.\r\n\r\nThe third time he called: \"Aurelie!\"\r\n\r\nShe jumped up with a start as she realized that that was the name by\r\nwhich they knew her. She hurried over to them.\r\n\r\n\"Are you deaf?\" demanded Monsieur Benoist.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I was listening to the machinists.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can leave me now,\" said M. Vulfran to his manager.\r\n\r\nWhen the manager had gone he turned to Perrine, who had remained\r\nstanding before him.\r\n\r\n\"Can you read, my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"English as well as French?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, both the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"But while reading English can you turn it into French?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the phrases are not too difficult; yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"The daily news from the papers, do you think you could do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never tried that, because if I read an English paper there is no\r\nneed for me to translate it for myself, because I understand what it\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will try. Tell the machinists that when they want you they can\r\ncall you, and then come and read from an English paper some articles\r\nthat I wish to have read to me in French. Go and tell the men and then\r\ncome back and sit down here beside me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had done what she was told, she sat down beside M. Vulfran and\r\ntook the newspaper that he handed her, \"The Dundee News.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I read?\" she asked as she unfolded it.\r\n\r\n\"Look for the commercial column.\"\r\n\r\nThe long black and white columns bewildered poor little Perrine. She was\r\nso nervous and her hands trembled so she wondered if she would ever be\r\nable to accomplish what she was asked to do. She gazed from the top of\r\none page to the bottom of another, and still could not find what she was\r\nseeking. She began to fear that her employer would get impatient with\r\nher for being so slow and awkward.\r\n\r\nBut instead of getting impatient he told her to take her time. With that\r\nkeen hearing so subtle with the blind, he had divined what a state of\r\nemotion she was in. He could tell that from the rustling of the newspaper\r\nshe held in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"We have plenty of time,\" he said, encouragingly; \"besides I don't\r\nsuppose you have ever read a trade journal before.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I have not,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nShe continued to scan the sheets, then suddenly she gave a little cry of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Have you found it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now look for these words,\" he said in English: \"Linen, Hemp, Jute,\r\nSacks, Twine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, you know English,\" she cried, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Five or six words of the trade; that is all, unfortunately,\" he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nWhen she had found what he required she commenced her translation, but\r\nshe was so hopelessly slow, hesitating and confused, that in a few\r\nmoments the beads of perspiration stood out on her forehead and hands\r\nfrom sheer agony, despite the fact that from time to time he encouraged\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"That will do. I understand that ... go on,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd she continued, raising her voice when the hammering blows from the\r\nworkmen became too loud.\r\n\r\nAt last she came to the end of the column.\r\n\r\n\"Now see if there is any news from Calcutta,\" said her employer.\r\n\r\nShe scanned the sheets again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here it is,\" she said, after a moment; \"From our special\r\ncorrespondent.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. Read!\"\r\n\r\n\"The news that we are receiving from Dacca....\"\r\n\r\nHer voice shook so as she said this name that Monsieur Vulfran's\r\nattention was attracted.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he said. \"Why are you trembling?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said, timidly; \"perhaps I am nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you not to mind,\" he chided. \"You are doing very much better\r\nthan I thought.\"\r\n\r\nShe read the cables from Dacca which mentioned a gathering of jute\r\nalong the shores of the Brahmaputra. Then he told her to look and see if\r\nthere was a cable from Saint Helena.\r\n\r\nHer eyes ran up and down the columns until the words \"Saint Helena\"\r\ncaught her eye.\r\n\r\n\"On the 23rd, the English steamer 'Alma' sailed from Calcutta for\r\nDundee; on the 24th, the Norwegian steamer 'Grundloven' sailed from\r\nNaraingaudj for Boulogne.\"\r\n\r\nHe appeared satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"That is very good,\" he said. \"I am quite pleased with you.\"\r\n\r\nShe wanted to reply, but afraid that her voice would betray her joy, she\r\nkept silent.\r\n\r\n\"I can see that until poor Bendit is better I can make good use of you,\"\r\nhe continued.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving an account of the work that the men had done, and\r\ntelling them to be as quick as possible, he told Perrine to lead him to\r\nthe manager's office.\r\n\r\n\"Have I to give you my hand?\" she asked, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, my child,\" he replied. \"How do you think you can guide me\r\notherwise? And warn me when there is anything in the way, and above all\r\ndon't be absent-minded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I assure you, sir, you can place every confidence in me,\" she said\r\nwith emotion.\r\n\r\n\"You see that I already have confidence,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nShe took him gently by the left hand, whilst with his right he held his\r\ncane, feeling ahead of him cautiously as he went forward.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely left the workshops before they came to the railway\r\ntracks, and she thought that she ought to warn him.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the rails, just here,\" she said. \"Please....\"\r\n\r\nBut he interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\"That you need not tell me,\" he said. \"I know every bit of the ground\r\nround about the works; my head knows it and my feet know it, but it's\r\nthe unexpected obstacles that we might find on the road that you must\r\ntell me about, something that's in the path that should not be. All the\r\nground I know, thoroughly.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not only his grounds that he knew, but he knew his people also.\r\nWhen he went through the yards his men greeted him. They not only took\r\ntheir hats off as though he saw them, but they said his name.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, sir!... Good morning, Monsieur Vulfran!\"\r\n\r\nAnd to a great number he was able to reply by their names: \"Good\r\nmorning, Jacque!\" ... \"Good morning, Pascal!\" He knew the voices of all\r\nthose who had long been in his employ. When he hesitated, which was\r\nrarely, for he knew almost all, he would stop and say: \"It's you, is it\r\nnot?\" mentioning the speaker's name.\r\n\r\nIf he made a mistake he explained why he had done so.\r\n\r\nWalking thus, it was a slow walk from the factories to the offices. She\r\nled him to his armchair; then he dismissed her.\r\n\r\n\"Until tomorrow,\" he said; \"I shall want you then.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nHARD QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at the same hour as on the previous day, Monsieur\r\nPaindavoine entered the workshops, guided by the manager. Perrine wanted\r\nto go and meet him, but she could not at this moment as she was busy\r\ntransmitting orders from the chief machinist to the men who were working\r\nfor him--masons, carpenters, smiths, mechanics. Clearly and without\r\nrepetition, she explained to each one what orders were given to him;\r\nthen she interpreted for the chief machinist the questions or objections\r\nwhich the French workmen desired to address to him.\r\n\r\nPerrine's grandfather had drawn near. The voices stopped as the tap of\r\nhis cane announced his approach, but he made a sign for them to continue\r\nthe same as though he were not there.\r\n\r\nAnd while Perrine, obeying him, went on talking with the men, he said\r\nquietly to the manager, though not low enough but that Perrine heard:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, that little girl would make a fine engineer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the manager; \"it's astonishing how decided and confident she\r\nis with the men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and she can do something else. Yesterday she translated the\r\n'Dundee News' more intelligently than Bendit. And it was the first time\r\nthat she had read trade journal stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does anyone know who her parents were?\" asked the manager.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Talouel does; I do not,\" said Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"She is in a very miserable and pitiful condition,\" said the manager.\r\n\r\n\"I gave her five francs for her food and lodging.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am speaking of her clothes. Her waist is worn to threads; I have never\r\nseen such a skirt on anybody but a beggar, and she certainly must have made\r\nthe shoes she is wearing herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And her face, what is she like, Benoist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very intelligent and very pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard looking or any signs of vice?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; quite the contrary. She has a very frank, honest look. She has\r\ngreat eyes that look as though they could pierce a wall, and yet at the\r\nsame time they have a soft, trusting look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where in the world does she come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not from these parts, that's a sure thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"She told me that her mother was English.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet she does not look English. She seems to belong to quite another\r\nrace, but she is very pretty; even with the old rags that she is wearing\r\nthe girl seems to have a strange sort of beauty. She must have a strong\r\ncharacter or some power, or why is it that these workmen pay such attention\r\nto such a poor little ragged thing?\"\r\n\r\nAnd as Benoist never missed a chance to flatter his employer, he added:\r\n\"Undoubtedly without having even seen her you have guessed all that I\r\nhave told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her accent struck me as being very cultured,\" replied Monsieur Vulfran.\r\n\r\nAlthough Perrine had not heard all that the two men had said, she had\r\ncaught a few words, which had thrown her into a state of great agitation.\r\nShe tried to recover her self-control, for it would never do to listen to\r\nwhat was being said behind her when the machinists and workmen were talking\r\nto her at the same time. What would her employer think if in giving her\r\nexplanations in French he saw that she had not been paying attention to her\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nHowever, everything was explained to them in a manner satisfactory to\r\nboth sides. When she had finished, Monsieur Vulfran called to her:\r\n\"Aurelie!\"\r\n\r\nThis time she took care to reply quickly to the name which in the future\r\nwas to be hers.\r\n\r\nAs on the previous day, he made her sit down beside him and gave her a\r\npaper to translate for him into French. This time it was not the \"Dundee\r\nNews,\" but the \"Dundee Trade Report Association,\" which is an official\r\nbulletin published on the commerce of jute. So without having to search for\r\nany particular article, she read it to him from beginning to end. Then,\r\nwhen the reading was over, as before, he asked her to lead him through the\r\ngrounds, but this time he began to question her about herself.\r\n\r\n\"You told me that you had lost your mother. How long ago was that?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Five weeks,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"In Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father died six months before mother,\" she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\nAs he held her hand in his he could feel it tremble, and he knew what\r\nanguish she felt as he evoked the memory of her dead parents, but he did\r\nnot change the subject; he gently continued to question her.\r\n\r\n\"What did your parents do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We sold things,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"In Paris? Round about Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"We traveled; we had a wagon and we were sometimes in one part of the\r\ncountry, sometimes in another.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when your mother died you left Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because mother made me promise not to stay in Paris after she had gone,\r\nbut to go North where my father's people live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"When my mother died we had to sell our wagon and our donkey and the few\r\nthings we had, and all this money was spent during her illness. When I\r\nleft the cemetery after she was buried all the money I had was five\r\nfrancs thirty-five centimes, which was not enough for me to take the\r\ntrain. So I decided to make the journey on foot.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Vulfran's fingers tightened over hers. She did not understand\r\nthis movement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, forgive me; I am boring you,\" she said. \"I am telling you things\r\nperhaps that are of no interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not boring me, Aurelie,\" said the blind man. \"On the contrary,\r\nI am pleased to know, what an honest little girl you are. I like people\r\nwho have courage, will, and determination, and who do not easily give\r\nup. If I like finding such qualities in men, how much more pleasure does\r\nit give me to find them in a girl of your age! So ... you started with\r\nfive francs thirty-five centimes in your pocket?...\"\r\n\r\n\"A knife, a piece of soap,\" continued little Perrine, \"a thimble, two\r\nneedles, some thread and a map of the roads, that was all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you understand the map?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I had to know, because we used to travel all over the country.\r\nThat was the only thing that I kept of our belongings.\"\r\n\r\nThe blind man stopped his little guide.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there a big tree here on the left?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with a seat all around it,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Come along then; we'll be better sitting down.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they were seated she went on with her story. She had no occasion to\r\nshorten it, for she saw that her employer was greatly interested.\r\n\r\n\"You never thought of begging?\" he asked, when she came to the time when\r\nshe had left the woods after being overtaken by the terrible storm.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; never.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what did you count upon when you saw that you could not get any\r\nwork?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't count on anything. I thought that if I kept on as long as I\r\nhad the strength I might find something. It was only when I was so\r\nhungry and so tired that I had to give up. If I had dropped one hour\r\nsooner all would have been over.\"\r\n\r\nThen she told him how her donkey, licking her face, had brought her back\r\nto consciousness, and how the ragpicker had saved her from starvation.\r\nThen passing quickly over the days she had spent with La Rouquerie, she\r\ncame to the day when she had made Rosalie's acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"And Rosalie told me,\" she said, \"that anyone who wants work can get it\r\nin your factories. I came and they employed me at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"When are you going on to your relations?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine was embarrassed. She did not expect this question.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going any further,\" she replied, after a moment's hesitation.\r\n\"I don't know if they want me, for they were angry with father. I was\r\ngoing to try and be near them because I have no one else, but I don't\r\nknow if I shall be welcomed. Now that I have found work, it seems to me\r\nthat it would be better for me to stay here. What will become of me if\r\nthey turn me away? I know I shall not starve here, and I am too afraid\r\nto go on the road again. I shall not let them know that I am here unless\r\nsome piece of luck comes my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't your relatives ever try to find out about you?\" asked M.\r\nVulfran.\r\n\r\n\"No, never,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, perhaps you are right,\" he said. \"Yet if you don't like to\r\ntake a chance and go and see them, why don't you write them a letter?\r\nThey may not be able to give you a home, so then you could stay here\r\nwhere you'd be sure of earning your living. On the other hand, they may\r\nbe very glad to have you, and you would have love and protection, which\r\nyou would not have here. You've learned already that life is very hard\r\nfor a young girl of your age, and in your position ... and very sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; I know it is very sad,\" said little Perrine, lifting her\r\nbeautiful eyes to the sightless eyes of her grandfather. \"Every day I\r\nthink how sad it is, and I know if they would hold out their arms to\r\nwelcome me I would run into them so quickly! But suppose they were just\r\nas cold and hard to me as they were with my father....\"\r\n\r\n\"Had these relations any serious cause to be angry with your father? Did\r\nhe do anything very bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think,\" said little Perrine, \"that my father, who was always so\r\ngood and kind, and who loved me and mother so much, could have ever been\r\nbad. He could not have done anything very wrong, and yet his people must\r\nhave had, in their opinion, serious reasons for being angry with him, it\r\nseems to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, evidently,\" said the blind man. \"But what they have against him\r\nthey could not hold against you. The sins of the father should not fall\r\nupon the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that could be true!\"\r\n\r\nShe said these words in a voice that trembled so with emotion that the\r\nblind man was surprised at the depths of this little girl's feelings.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, \"how in the depths of your heart how much you want\r\ntheir love and affection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but how I dread being turned away,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"But why should you be?\" he asked. \"Have your grandparents any other\r\nchildren beside your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't they be glad that you should come and take the place of\r\nthe son they have lost? You don't know what it is to be alone in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do ... I know only too well what it is,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Youth who has a future ahead is not like old age, which has nothing\r\nbefore it but Death.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. She did not take her eyes from his face, for he could\r\nnot see her. What did his words mean? From the expression of his face\r\nlittle Perrine tried to read the inmost thoughts that stirred this old\r\nman's heart.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, after waiting a moment, \"what do you think you will\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hesitate because I feel so bad about it,\" she said. \"If I could only\r\nbelieve that they would be glad to have me and would not turn me\r\naway....\"\r\n\r\n\"You know nothing of life, poor little girl,\" said the old gentleman.\r\n\"Age should not be alone any more than youth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think all old people feel like that?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"They may not think that it is so, but they feel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\" she said, trembling, her eyes still fixed on his face.\r\n\r\nHe did not reply directly, but speaking softly as though to himself, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; they feel it....\"\r\n\r\nThen getting up from his seat abruptly, as though to drive away thoughts\r\nthat made him feel sad, he said in a tone of authority: \"Come across to\r\nthe offices. I wish to go there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSECRETARY TO M. VULFRAN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen would Fabry, the engineer, return? That was the question that Perrine\r\nanxiously asked herself, for on that day her role of interpreter to the\r\nEnglish machinists would terminate.\r\n\r\nThat of translator of newspaper articles to M. Vulfran, would that continue\r\nuntil M. Bendit had recovered from his illness? Here was another question\r\nthat made her even still more anxious.\r\n\r\nIt was on Thursday, when she reached the factories with the two machinists,\r\nthat she found Monsieur Fabry in the workshop busy inspecting the work that\r\nhad already been done. Discreetly she waited at a distance, not taking part\r\nin any of the explanations that were being made, but all the same the chief\r\nmachinist drew her into the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Without this little girl's help,\" he said, \"we should have stood here\r\nwaiting with our arms folded.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Fabry then looked at her, but he said nothing, and she on her\r\nside did not dare ask him what she had to do now, whether she was to\r\nstay at Saint-Pipoy or return to Maraucourt.\r\n\r\nShe stood there undecided, thinking that as it was M. Vulfran who had\r\nsent for her, it would be he who would send her away or keep her.\r\n\r\nHe came at his usual hour, led by the manager, who gave him an account\r\nof the orders that the engineer had given and the observations that he\r\nhad made. But it appeared that he was not completely satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity that the little girl is not here,\" he said in annoyance.\r\n\r\n\"But she is here,\" replied the manager, making a sign to Perrine to\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\"Why was it you did not go back to Maraucourt, girl?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I thought that I ought not to leave here until you told me to go back,\"\r\nshe replied.\r\n\r\n\"That was quite right,\" he said. \"You must be here waiting for me when I\r\ncome....\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped for a second, then went on: \"And I shall also need you at\r\nMaraucourt. You can go back this evening, and tomorrow be at the office.\r\nI will tell you what you will have to do.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had interpreted the orders which he wished to give to the\r\nmachinists, he left, and that day she was not required to read the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nBut what did that matter? Hadn't her grandfather said that on the morrow he\r\nwould need her at Maraucourt?\r\n\r\n\"I shall need you at Maraucourt!\" She kept repeating these words over and\r\nover again as she tramped along the roads over which William had driven her\r\nin the trap.\r\n\r\nHow was she going to be employed? She imagined all sorts of ways, but she\r\ncould not feel certain of anything, except that she was not to be sent back\r\nto push trucks. That was a sure thing; for the rest she would have to wait.\r\nBut she need not wait in a state of feverish anxiety, for from her\r\ngrandfather's manner she might hope for the best. If she, a poor little\r\ngirl, could only have enough wisdom to follow the course that her mother\r\nhad mapped out for her before dying, slowly and carefully, without trying\r\nto hasten events, her life, which she held in her own hands, would be what\r\nshe herself made it. She must remember this always, in everything she said,\r\nevery time she had to make a resolution, every time she took a step\r\nforward, and each time she took this step she must take it without asking\r\nadvice of anyone.\r\n\r\nOn her way back to Maraucourt she turned all this over in her little\r\nhead. She walked slowly, stopping when she wanted to pick a flower that\r\ngrew beneath the hedge, or when, in looking over a fence, she could see\r\na pretty one that seemed to be beckoning to her from the meadow. Now and\r\nagain she got rather excited; then she would quicken her step; then she\r\nslowed up again, telling herself that there was no occasion for her to\r\nhurry. Here was one thing she had to do--she must make it a rule, make\r\nit a habit, not to give way to an impulse. Oh, she would have to be very\r\nwise. Her pretty face was very grave as she walked along, her hands full\r\nof lovely wild flowers.\r\n\r\nShe found her island the same as she had left it, each thing in its place.\r\nThe birds had even shown respect for the berries beneath the willow tree\r\nwhich had ripened in her absence. Here was something for her supper. She\r\nhad not counted upon having berries.\r\n\r\nShe had returned at an earlier hour than when she had left the factory,\r\nso she did not feel inclined to go to bed as soon as her supper was\r\nover. She sat by the pond in the quiet of the evening, watching the\r\nnight slowly fall.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had been away only a short time, something seemed to have\r\noccurred to disturb the quietness of her little shelter. In the fields\r\nthere was no longer the solemn silence of the night which had struck her on\r\nthe first days that she had installed herself on the island. Previously,\r\nall she could hear in the entire valley, on the pond, in the big trees and\r\nthe foliage, was the mysterious rustling of the birds as they returned to\r\nthe nests for the night. Now the silence was disturbed by all kinds of\r\nnoises--the blow of the forge, the grind of the axle, the swish of a whip,\r\nand the murmur of voices.\r\n\r\nAs she had tramped along the roads from Saint-Pipoy she had noticed that\r\nthe harvest had commenced in the fields that were most exposed, and soon\r\nthe mowers would come as far as her little nook, which was shaded by the\r\nbig trees.\r\n\r\nShe would certainly have to leave her tiny home; it would not be possible\r\nfor her to live there longer. Whether she had to leave on account of the\r\nharvesters or the bird catchers, it was the same thing, just a matter of\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAlthough for the last few days she had got used to having sheets on her\r\nbed, and a room with a window, and closed doors, she slept that night on\r\nher bed of ferns as though she had never left it, and it was only when\r\nthe sun rose in the heavens that she awoke.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the factory, instead of following her companions to\r\nwhere the trucks stood, she made her way to the general offices,\r\nwondering what she should do--go in, or wait outside.\r\n\r\nShe decided to do the latter. If they saw her standing outside the\r\ndoors, someone would see her and call her in.\r\n\r\nShe waited there for almost an hour. Finally she saw Talouel, who asked\r\nher roughly what she was doing there.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Vulfran told me to come this morning to the office to see\r\nhim,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Outside there, is not the office,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I was waiting to be called in,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Come up then.\"\r\n\r\nShe went up the steps, following him in.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do at Saint-Pipoy?\" he asked, turning to look at her.\r\n\r\nShe told him in what capacity M. Vulfran had employed her.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Fabry then had been messing up things?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--you don't know? Are you a silly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not, and you know it; and if you don't reply it's because you\r\ndon't want to. Don't forget who is talking to you; do you know what I am\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the foreman.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means the master. And as your master you do as I tell you. I am\r\ngoing to know all. Those who don't obey I fire! Remember that!\"\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the man whom she had heard the factory girls talking\r\nabout when she had slept in that terrible room at Mother Françoise's.\r\nThe tyrant who wanted to be everything in the works, not only at\r\nMaraucourt, but at Saint-Pipoy, at Bacourt, at Flexelles, everywhere,\r\nand who would employ any means to uphold his authority, even disputing\r\nit with that of Monsieur Vulfran's.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you what Monsieur Fabry has been doing?\" he asked, lowering his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you because I do not know myself. But I can tell you what\r\nobservations Monsieur Vulfran had me interpret for the machinists.\"\r\n\r\nShe repeated what she had had to tell the men without omitting a single\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Monsieur Vulfran make you translate his letters?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he did not. I only read some articles from the 'Dundee News' and a\r\nlittle paper all through; it was called the 'Dundee Trades Report\r\nAssociation.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You know if you don't tell me the truth, all the truth, I'll get it\r\npretty quick, and then ... Ouste! off you go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I not speak the truth?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"It's up to you to do so,\" he retorted. \"I've warned you ... remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll remember,\" said Perrine, \"I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Now go and sit down on that bench over there. If the boss\r\nreally needs you he'll remember that he told you to come here this\r\nmorning. He is busy talking to some of his men now.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat on the bench for almost an hour, not daring to move so long as\r\nTalouel was near. What a dreadful man! How afraid she was of him! But it\r\nwould never do to let him see that she was afraid. He wanted her to spy\r\non her employer, and then tell him what was in the letters that she\r\ntranslated for him!\r\n\r\nThis indeed might well scare her, yet there was something to be pleased\r\nabout. Talouel evidently thought that she would have the letters to\r\ntranslate; that meant that her grandfather would have her with him all\r\nthe time that M. Bendit was ill.\r\n\r\nWhile she sat there waiting she caught sight of William several times. When\r\nhe was not fulfilling the duties of coachman he acted as useful man to\r\nM. Vulfran. Each time that he appeared on the scene Perrine thought that he\r\nhad come to fetch her, but he passed without saying a word to her. He\r\nseemed always in a hurry.\r\n\r\nFinally some workingmen came out of M. Vulfran's office with a very\r\ndissatisfied expression on their faces. Then William came and beckoned to\r\nher and showed her into M. Vulfran's office. She found her grandfather\r\nseated at a large table covered with ledgers, at the side of which were\r\npaper weights stamped with large letters in relief. In this way the blind\r\nman was able to find what his eyes could not see.\r\n\r\nWithout announcing her, William had pushed Perrine inside the room and\r\nclosed the door after her. She waited a moment, then she thought that she\r\nhad better let M. Vulfran know that she was there.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, \"I am here ... Aurelie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I recognized your step. Come nearer and listen to me. I am\r\ninterested in you. You have told me your troubles and I think you have been\r\nvery courageous. From the translations that you have made for me, and the\r\nmanner in which you have acted as interpreter for the machinists, I see\r\nthat you are intelligent. Now that I am blind, I need someone to see for\r\nme, to tell me about things I wish to know, and also about things that\r\nstrike them also. I had hoped that William would have been able to do this\r\nfor me, but unfortunately he drinks too much and I can't keep him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, would you like to take the position that he has been unable to\r\nhold? To commence with, you will have ninety francs a month. If I am\r\npleased with you I may do more for you.\"\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with joy, Perrine stood before the blind man unable to say a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you speak?\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"I can't ... I don't know what to say ... to thank you,\" she said. Her\r\nvoice broke. \"I feel so....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said. \"I know how you feel. Your voice tells me that. I\r\nam pleased. That is as good as a promise that you will do all you can to\r\ngive me satisfaction. Now let us change the subject. Have you written to\r\nyour grandparents?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Perrine, hesitatingly; \"I ... I did not have any paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well. You will be able to find all you need in Monsieur Bendit's\r\noffice. When you write tell them exactly what position you occupy in my\r\nemploy. If they have anything better to offer you, they will send for you;\r\nif not, they will let you remain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly ... I am sure I shall stay....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so. I think it will be best for you. As you will be in the\r\noffices, you will be in communication with my employés; you can take my\r\norders to them, and you will also have to go out with me, so in that\r\ncase you cannot wear your factory clothes, which Monsieur Benoist tells\r\nme are rather shabby.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are in rags,\" said Perrine; \"but I assure you, sir, it is not\r\nbecause I am lazy or that I don't care....\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of that,\" replied M. Vulfran. \"Now, as all that will be changed,\r\nyou go to the cashier in the counting house, and he will give you a money\r\norder. You can go then to Madame Lachaise in the village and get some\r\nclothes, some linen, hats and shoes; what you need....\"\r\n\r\nPerrine was listening as though it were not an old blind man with a\r\ngrave face that was speaking, but a beautiful fairy who was holding over\r\nher her magic wand.\r\n\r\nShe was silent. Then his voice recalled her to the reality.\r\n\r\n\"You are free to choose what you like, but bear in mind the choice you\r\nmake will guide me in acquiring a knowledge of your character. Now you\r\ncan go and see about your things at once. I shall not need you until\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSUSPICION AND CONFIDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nShe went to the counting house, and after the chief cashier and his\r\nclerks had eyed her from head to foot, she was handed the order which M.\r\nVulfran had said was to be given to her. She left the factory wondering\r\nwhere she would find Madame Lachaise's shop.\r\n\r\nShe hoped that it was the woman who had sold her the calico, because as\r\nshe knew her already, it would be less embarrassing to ask her advice as\r\nto what she should buy, than it would be to ask a perfect stranger. And\r\nso much hung on the choice she would make; her anxiety increased as she\r\nthought of her employer's last words: \"the choice you make will guide me\r\nin acquiring a knowledge of your character.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not need this warning to keep her from making extravagant\r\npurchases, but then on the other hand, what she thought would be the\r\nright things for herself, would her employer consider suitable? In her\r\nfancy she had worn beautiful clothes, and when she was quite a little\r\ngirl she had been very proud to display her pretty things, but of\r\ncourse dresses on this order would not be fitting for her now. The\r\nsimplest that she could find would be better.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought that the unexpected present of new clothes could\r\nhave filled her with so much anxiety and embarrassment. She knew that\r\nshe ought to be filled with joy and yet here she was greatly worried and\r\nhesitating.\r\n\r\nJust near the church she found Mme. Lachaise's shop. It was by far the best\r\nshop in Maraucourt. In the window there was a fine display of materials,\r\nribbons, lingerie, hats, jewels, perfumes, which aroused the envy and\r\ntempted the greed of all the frivolous girls throughout the surrounding\r\nvillages. It was here where they spent their small earnings, the same as\r\ntheir fathers and husbands spent theirs at the taverns.\r\n\r\nWhen Perrine saw this display of finery she was still more perplexed and\r\nembarrassed. She entered the shop and stood in the middle of the floor,\r\nfor neither the mistress of the establishment nor the milliners who were\r\nworking behind the counter seemed to think that the ragged little girl\r\nrequired any attention. Finally Perrine decided to hold out the envelope\r\ncontaining the order that she held in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you want, little girl?\" demanded Madame Lachaise.\r\n\r\nAs she still held out the envelope the mistress of the store caught\r\nsight of the words Maraucourt Factories, Vulfran Paindavoine in one of\r\nthe corners. The expression of her face changed at once, her smile was\r\nvery pleasant now.\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish, Mademoiselle?\" she asked, leaving her desk and drawing\r\nforward a chair for Perrine. Perrine told her that she wanted a dress,\r\nsome underlinen, a pair of shoes and a hat.\r\n\r\n\"We can supply you with all those,\" said Madame Lachaise, \"and with\r\ngoods of the very best quality. Would you like to commence with the\r\ndress? Yes. Very well then, I will show you some materials.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not materials that Perrine wished to see; she wanted a\r\nready-made dress. Something that she could put on at once, or at least\r\nsomething that would be ready for her to wear the next day when she went\r\nout with Monsieur Paindavoine.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are going out with Monsieur Vulfran?\" said Madame Lachaise\r\nquickly; her curiosity was strung to its highest pitch at this\r\nstatement. She wondered what the all powerful master of Maraucourt could\r\nhave to do with this ragged little girl and she did not hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nBut instead of replying to her question Perrine continued to explain\r\nthat she wanted to see some black dresses as she was in mourning.\r\n\r\n\"You want a dress so as to be able to attend a funeral then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not for a funeral,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you understand, Mademoiselle, if I know what you require the\r\ndress for I shall be able to know what style, material, and price it\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n\"I want the plainest style,\" said little Perrine timidly, \"and the\r\nlightest but best wearing material, and the lowest price.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, very good,\" replied Madame Lachaise, \"they will show you\r\nsomething. Virginie, attend to Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\nHow her tone had changed! her manner also. With great dignity Madame\r\nLachaise went back to her seat at the desk, disdaining to busy herself\r\nwith a customer who had such small desires. She was probably one of the\r\nservant's daughters, for whom Monsieur Vulfran was going to buy a\r\nmourning outfit; but which servant?\r\n\r\nHowever as Virginie brought forward a cashmere dress trimmed with\r\npassementerie and jet, she thought fit to interfere.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not that,\" she said. \"That would be beyond the price. Show her\r\nthat black challis dress with the little dots. The skirt will be a\r\ntrifle too long and the waist too large, but it can easily be made to\r\nfit her, besides we have nothing else in black.\"\r\n\r\nHere was a reason that dispensed with all others, but even though it was\r\ntoo large, Perrine found the skirt and waist that went with it very\r\npretty, and the saleslady assured her that with a little alteration is\r\nwould suit her beautifully, and of course she had to believe her.\r\n\r\nThe choice for the stockings and undergarments was easier because she\r\nwanted the least expensive, but when she stated that she only wanted to\r\npurchase two pairs of stockings and two chemises, Mlle. Virginie became\r\njust as disdainful as her employer, and it was as though she was\r\nconferring a favor that she condescended to try some shoes on Perrine,\r\nand the black straw hat which completed the wardrobe of this little\r\nsimpleton.\r\n\r\nCould anyone believe that a girl would be such an idiot! She had been\r\ngiven an order to buy what she wanted and she asked for two pairs of\r\nstockings and two chemises. And when Perrine asked for some\r\nhandkerchiefs, which for a long time had been the object of her desires,\r\nthis new purchase, which was limited to three handkerchiefs, did not\r\nhelp to change the shopkeeper's or the saleslady's contempt for her.\r\n\r\n\"She's nothing at all,\" they murmured.\r\n\r\n\"And now shall we send you these things?\" asked Mme. Lachaise.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you,\" said Perrine, \"I will call this evening and fetch them\r\nwhen the alterations are made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, don't come before eight o'clock or after nine,\" she was\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nPerrine had a very good reason for not wishing to have the things sent\r\nto her. She was not sure where she was going to sleep that night. Her\r\nlittle island was not to be thought of. Those who possess nothing can\r\ndispense with doors and locks, but when one has riches ... for despite\r\nthe condescension of the shopkeeper and her assistant, these were riches\r\nto Perrine and needed to be guarded. So that night she would have to\r\ntake a lodging and quite naturally she thought of going to Rosalie's\r\ngrandmother. When she left Madame Lachaise's shop, she went on her way\r\nto Mother Françoise's to see if she could accommodate her and give her\r\nwhat she desired; that was a tiny little room that would not cost much.\r\n\r\nAs she reached the gate she met Rosalie coming out, walking quickly.\r\n\r\n\"You're going out?\" cried Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you ... so you are free then?\"\r\n\r\nIn a few hurried words they explained.\r\n\r\nRosalie, who was going on an important errand to Picquigny, could not\r\nreturn to her grandmother's at once, as she would have liked, so as to\r\nmake the best arrangements that she could for Perrine; but as Perrine\r\nhad nothing to do for that day, why shouldn't she go with her to\r\nPicquigny; and they would come back together; it would be a pleasure\r\ntrip then.\r\n\r\nThey went off gaily, and Rosalie accomplished her errand quickly, then\r\ntheir pleasure trip commenced. They walked through the fields, chatting\r\nand laughing, picked flowers, then rested in the heat of the day under\r\nthe shadows of the great trees. It was not until night that they arrived\r\nback in Maraucourt. Not until Rosalie reached her grandmother's gate did\r\nshe realize what time it was.\r\n\r\n\"What will Aunt Zenobie say?\" she said half afraid.\r\n\r\n\"Oh well....\" began Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Oh well, I don't care,\" said Rosalie defiantly, \"I've enjoyed myself\r\n... and you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you who have people to talk to every day have enjoyed\r\nyourself, how much more have I who never have anybody to talk to,\" said\r\nPerrine ruefully.\r\n\r\n\"I've had a lovely time,\" she sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then we don't care what anybody says,\" said Rosalie bravely.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Aunt Zenobie was busy waiting on the boarders, so the\r\narrangements for the room was made with Mother Françoise, who did not\r\ndrive too hard a bargain and that was done quickly and promptly. Fifty\r\nfrancs a month for two meals a day; twelve francs for a little room\r\ndecorated with a little mirror, a window, and a dressing table.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock Perrine dined alone in the general dining room, a table\r\nnapkin on her lap. At eight-thirty she went to Madame Lachaise's\r\nestablishment to fetch her dress and other things which were quite ready\r\nfor her. At nine o'clock, in her tiny room, the door of which she\r\nlocked, she went to bed, a little worried, a little excited, a little\r\nhesitating, but, in her heart of hearts full of hope.\r\n\r\nNow we should see.\r\n\r\nWhat she did see the next morning when she was called into M. Vulfran's\r\noffice after he had given his orders to his principal employés, was such\r\na severe expression on his face that she was thoroughly disconcerted;\r\nalthough the eyes that turned towards her as she entered his room were\r\ndevoid of look, she could not mistake the expression on this face that\r\nshe had studied so much.\r\n\r\nCertainly it was not the kind look of a benefactor, but quite the\r\nreverse: it was an expression of displeasure and anger that she saw.\r\n\r\nWhat had she done wrong that he should be angry; with her?\r\n\r\nShe put this question to herself but she could find no reply to it;\r\nperhaps she had spent too much at Madame Lachaise's and her employer had\r\njudged her character from these purchases. And in her selection she had\r\ntried to be so modest and economical. What should she have bought then?\r\nor rather what should she not have bought?\r\n\r\nBut she had no more time to wonder, for her employer was speaking to her\r\nin a severe tone:\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not tell me the truth?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"In what have I not told the truth?\" she asked in a frightened voice.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to your conduct since you came to this village.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I assure you, Monsieur, I have told you the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me that you lodged at Mother Françoise's house. And when you\r\nleft there where did you go? I may as well tell you that yesterday\r\nZenobie, that is Françoise's daughter, was asked to give some\r\ninformation, some references of you, and she said that you only spent\r\none night in her mother's house, then you disappeared, and no one knew\r\nwhat you did from that night until now.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine had listened to the commencement of this cross examination in\r\nafright, but as Monsieur Vulfran went on she grew braver.\r\n\r\n\"There is someone who knows what I did after I left the room I used at\r\nMother Françoise's,\" she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rosalie, her granddaughter, knows. She will tell you that what I am now\r\ngoing to tell you, sir, is the truth. That is, if you think my doings\r\nare worth knowing about.\"\r\n\r\n\"The position that you are to hold in my service demands that I know\r\nwhat you are,\" said Monsieur Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Monsieur, I will tell you,\" said little Perrine. \"When you know\r\nyou can send for Rosalie and question her without me seeing her, and\r\nthen you will have the proof that I have not deceived you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that can be done,\" he said in a softened voice, \"now go on....\"\r\n\r\nShe told her story, dwelling on the horror of that night in that\r\nmiserable room, her disgust, how she was almost suffocated, and how she\r\ncrept outside at the break of dawn too sick to stay in that terrible\r\ngarret one moment longer.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot you bear what the other girls could?\" asked her employer.\r\n\r\n\"The others perhaps have not lived in the open air as I have,\" said\r\nPerrine, her beautiful eyes fixed on her grandfather's face. \"I assure\r\nyou I am not hard to please. We were so poor that we endured great\r\nmisery. But I could not stay in that room. I should have died, and I\r\ndon't think it was wrong of me to try to escape death. I could not live\r\nif I had to sleep there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why! can that room be so unhealthy, so unwholesome as that?\" mused\r\nMonsieur Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir,\" cried Perrine, \"if you could see it you would never permit\r\nyour work girls to live there, never, never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on with your story,\" he said abruptly.\r\n\r\nShe told him how she had discovered the tiny island and how the idea had\r\ncome to her to take possession of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"You were not afraid?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am not accustomed to being afraid,\" she said, with a wan little smile\r\nflitting across her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n\"You are speaking of that cabin in the valley there a little to the side\r\nof the road to Saint-Pipoy, on the left, are you not?\" asked Monsieur\r\nVulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"That belongs to me and my nephews use it. Was it there that you slept?\"\r\n\r\n\"I not only slept there, but I worked there and I ate there, and I even\r\ngave a dinner to Rosalie, and she can tell you about it,\" said little\r\nPerrine eagerly, for now that she had told him her story she wanted him to\r\nknow everything. \"I did not leave the cabin until you sent for me to go to\r\nSaint-Pipoy, and then you told me to stay there so as to be on hand to\r\ninterpret for the machinists. And now tonight I have taken a lodging again\r\nat Mother Françoise's, but now I can pay for a room all to myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you rich then, that you were able to invite a friend to dinner?\"\r\nasked the blind man.\r\n\r\n\"If I only dare tell you,\" said Perrine timidly.\r\n\r\n\"You can tell me everything,\" said the blind man.\r\n\r\n\"I may take up your time just to tell you a story about two little\r\ngirls?\" asked little Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Now that I cannot use my time as I should like,\" said the blind man\r\nsadly, \"it is often very long, very long ... and empty.\"\r\n\r\nA shade passed over her grandfather's face. He had so much; there were men\r\nwho envied him--and yet how sad and barren was his life. When he said that\r\nhis days were \"empty\" Perrine's heart went out to him. She also, since the\r\ndeath of her father and mother, knew what it was for the days to be long\r\nand empty, nothing to fill them but the anxiety, the fatigue, and the\r\nmisery of the moment. No one to share them with you, none to uphold you, or\r\ncheer you. He had not known bodily fatigue, privations and poverty. But\r\nthey are not the only trials to be borne, there are other sorrows in this\r\nworld from which one suffers. And it was those other sorrows that had made\r\nhim say those few words in such a sad, sad tone; the memory of which made\r\nthis old blind man bend his head while the tears sprang into his sightless\r\neyes. But no tears fell. Perrine's eyes had not left his face; if she had\r\nseen that her story did not interest him, she would have stopped at once,\r\nbut she knew that he was not bored. He interrupted her several times and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"And you did that!\"\r\n\r\nThen he questioned her, asking her to tell him in detail what she had\r\nomitted for fear of tiring him. He put questions to her which showed that\r\nhe wished to have an exact account, not only of her work, but above all to\r\nknow what means she had employed to replace all that she had been lacking.\r\n\r\n\"And that's what you did?\" he asked again and again.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished her story, he placed his hand on her head: \"You\r\nare a brave little girl,\" he said, \"and I am pleased to see that one can\r\ndo something with you. Now go into your office and spend the time as you\r\nlike; at three o'clock we will go out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE SCHEMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bendit's office which Perrine occupied was a tiny place whose sole\r\nfurniture consisted of a table and two chairs, a bookcase in blackwood,\r\nand a map of the world.\r\n\r\nYet with its polished pine floor, and a window with its red and white\r\nshade, it appeared very bright to Perrine. Not only was the office\r\nassigned to her cheerful, but she found that by leaving the door open\r\nshe could see and occasionally hear what was going on in the other\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Vulfran's nephews, Theodore and Casimir, had their rooms on the\r\nright and on the left of his; after theirs came the counting house, then\r\nlastly, there was Fabry, the engineer's, office. This one was opposite\r\nhers. Fabry's office was a large room where several draughtsmen were\r\nstanding up before their drawings, arranged on high inclined desks.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing to do and not liking to take M. Bendit's chair, Perrine\r\ntook a seat by the door. She opened one of the dictionaries which were\r\nthe only kind of books the office contained. She would have preferred\r\nanything else but she had to be contented with what was there.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed slowly, but at last the bell rang for luncheon. Perrine\r\nwas one of the first to go out. On the way she was joined by Fabry and\r\nMombleux. They also were going to Mother Françoise's house.\r\n\r\n\"So then you are a comrade of ours, Mademoiselle,\" said Mombleux, who\r\nhad not forgotten his humiliation at Saint-Pipoy, and he wanted to make\r\nthe one who was the cause of it pay for it.\r\n\r\nShe felt the sarcasm of his words and for a moment she was disconcerted,\r\nbut she recovered herself quickly.\r\n\r\n\"No, Monsieur,\" she said quietly, \"not of yours but of William's.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of her reply evidently pleased the engineer, for turning to\r\nPerrine he gave her an encouraging smile.\r\n\r\n\"But if you are replacing Mr. Bendit?\" said Mombleux obstinately.\r\n\r\n\"Say that Mademoiselle is keeping his job for him,\" retorted Fabry.\r\n\r\n\"It's the same thing,\" answered Mombleux.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, for in a week or two, when he'll be better, he'll come back\r\nin his old place. He certainly would not have had it if Mademoiselle had\r\nnot been here to keep it for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that you and I also have helped to keep it for him,\"\r\nsaid Mombleux.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but this little girl has done her share; he'll have to be grateful\r\nto all three of us,\" said Fabry, smiling again at Perrine.\r\n\r\nIf she had misunderstood the sense of Mombleux's words, the way in which\r\nshe was treated at Mother Françoise's would have enlightened her. Her\r\nplace was not set at the boarders' table as it would have been if she\r\nhad been considered their equal, but at a little table at the side. And\r\nshe was served after everyone else had taken from the dishes what they\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nBut that did not hurt her; what did it matter to her if she were served\r\nfirst or last, and if the best pieces had already been taken. What\r\ninterested her was that she was placed near enough to them to hear their\r\nconversation. She hoped that what she heard might guide her as to how\r\nshe should act in the midst of the difficulties which confronted her.\r\n\r\nThese men knew the habits of M. Vulfran, his nephews, and Talouel, of\r\nwhom she stood so much in fear; a word from them would enlighten her and\r\nshe might be shown a danger which she did not even suspect, and if she\r\nwas aware of it she could avoid it. She would not spy upon them. She\r\nwould not listen at doors. When they were speaking they knew that they\r\nwere not alone. So she need have no scruples but could profit by their\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately on that particular morning they said nothing that\r\ninterested her; their talk was on insignificant matters. As soon as she\r\nhad finished her meal she hurried to Rosalie, for she wanted to know how\r\nM. Vulfran had discovered that she had only slept one night at her\r\ngrandmother's house.\r\n\r\n\"It was that Skinny who came here while you were at Picquigny,\" said\r\nRosalie, \"and he got Aunt Zenobie to talk about you; and you bet it\r\nisn't hard to make Aunt Zenobie talk especially when she gets something\r\nfor doing so. She told him that you had spent only one night here and\r\nall sorts of other things besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other things?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know because I was not there, but you can imagine the worst,\r\nbut fortunately it has not turned out badly for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, on the contrary it has turned out very well, because M. Vulfran was\r\namused and interested when I told him my story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell Aunt Zenobie, that'll make her mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't put her against me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put her against you; oh, there's no danger of that now. She knows the\r\nposition that M. Vulfran has given you, you won't have a better friend\r\n... seemingly. You'll see tomorrow. Only if you don't want that Skinny\r\nto know your business, don't tell anything to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she's sly enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but now you've warned me....\"\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock as arranged, M. Vulfran rang for Perrine and they drove\r\noff in the phaeton to make the customary round of the factories, for he\r\ndid not let a single day pass without visiting the different buildings.\r\n\r\nAlthough he could not see he could at least be seen, and when he gave\r\nhis orders it was difficult to believe that he was blind; he seemed to\r\nknow everything that was going on.\r\n\r\nThat day they began at the village of Flexelles. They stayed some time\r\nin the building and when they came out William was not to be seen. The\r\nhorse was tied to a tree and William, the coachman, had disappeared. As\r\nsoon as his employer had gone into his factories, William of course, as\r\nusual, had hurried to the nearest wine shop ... meeting a boon companion\r\nthere he had forgotten the hour.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran sent one of his men off to search for his recalcitrant\r\ncoachman. After waiting several minutes, the blind man became very\r\nangry. Finally William, with head held high, came staggering along.\r\n\r\n\"I can tell by the sound of his footsteps that he is drunk, Benoist,\"\r\nsaid M. Vulfran, addressing his manager, who stood beside him. \"I am\r\nright, am I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir ... nothing can be hidden from you. He is drunk....\"\r\n\r\nWilliam began to apologize.\r\n\r\n\"I've just come from....\" he began, but his employer cut him short.\r\n\r\n\"That is enough,\" said M. Vulfran, sternly. \"I can tell by your breath\r\nand the way you walk that you are drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just going to say, sir,\" began William again, as he untied the\r\nhorse, but at that moment he dropped the whip and stooping down, he\r\ntried three times to grasp it. The manager looked grave.\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be better if I drove you to Maraucourt,\" he said. \"I\r\nam afraid you would not be safe with William.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" demanded William insolently.\r\n\r\n\"Silence,\" commanded M. Vulfran, in a tone that admitted of no reply.\r\n\"From this moment you can consider yourself dismissed from my service.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, I was going to say....\"\r\n\r\nWith an uplifted motion of his hand M. Vulfran stopped him and turned to\r\nhis manager.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Benoist,\" he said, \"but I think this little girl can drive\r\nme home. Coco is as quiet as a lamb, and she can well replace this\r\ndrunken creature.\"\r\n\r\nHe was assisted into the carriage, and Perrine took her place beside\r\nhim. She was very grave, for she felt the responsibility of her position.\r\n\r\n\"Not too quickly,\" said M. Vulfran, when she touched Coco with the end\r\nof her whip.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, sir, I don't want to go quickly, I assure you,\" she said,\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n\"That's a good thing; let her just trot.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great surprise in the streets of Maraucourt when the\r\nvillagers saw the head of the firm seated beside a little girl wearing a\r\nhat of black straw and a black dress, who was gravely driving old Coco\r\nat a straight trot instead of the zigzag course that William forced the\r\nold animal to take in spite of herself. What was happening? Where was\r\nthis little girl going? They questioned one another as they stood at the\r\ndoors, for few people in the village knew of her and of the position\r\nthat M. Vulfran had given her.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Mother Françoise's house, Aunt Zenobie was leaning\r\nover the gate talking to two women. When she caught sight of Perrine she\r\nstared in amazement, but her look of astonishment was quickly followed\r\nby her best smile, the smile of a real friend.\r\n\r\n\"Good day, Monsieur Vulfran! Good day, Mademoiselle Aurelie!\" she called\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the carriage had passed she told her neighbors how she had\r\nprocured the fine position for the young girl who had been their boarder.\r\nShe had recommended her so highly to Skinny.\r\n\r\n\"She's a nice girl, though,\" she added, \"and she'll not forget what she\r\nowes us. She owes it all to us.\"\r\n\r\nIf the villagers had been surprised to see Perrine driving M. Vulfran,\r\nTalouel was absolutely stunned.\r\n\r\n\"Where is William?\" he cried, hurrying down the steps of the veranda to\r\nmeet his employer.\r\n\r\n\"Sent off for continual drunkenness,\" said M. Vulfran, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"I had supposed that you would take this step eventually,\" said Talouel.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" replied his employer briefly.\r\n\r\nTalouel had established his power in the house by these two words, \"I\r\nsuppose.\" His aim was to persuade his chief that he was so devoted to\r\nhis interests that he was able to foresee every wish that he might have.\r\nSo he usually began with these words, \"I suppose that you want....\"\r\n\r\nHe had the subtlety of the peasant, always on the alert, and his quality\r\nfor spying made him stop at nothing to get the information he desired.\r\nM. Vulfran usually made the same reply when Talouel had \"supposed\"\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" the blind man would say.\r\n\r\n\"And I suppose you find,\" continued Talouel, as he helped his employer\r\nto get down, \"that the one who has replaced him deserves your trust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said the blind man again.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not astonished,\" added the crafty Talouel. \"The day when Rosalie\r\nbrought her here I thought there was something in her, and I was sure\r\nyou would soon find that out.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he looked at Perrine, and his look plainly said: \"You\r\nsee what I've done for you. Don't forget it, and be ready to do me\r\na service.\"\r\n\r\nA demand of payment on this order was not long in coming.\r\n\r\nA little later, stopping before the door of the office in which Perrine\r\nsat, he said in a low voice from the doorway:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what happened with William.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine thought that if she frankly replied to his question she would\r\nnot be revealing any serious matter, so she related exactly what had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, good,\" he said, more at ease. \"Now, if he should come to me and\r\nask to be taken back I'll settle with him.\"\r\n\r\nLater on Fabry and Mombleux put the same question to her, for everyone\r\nnow knew that little Perrine had had to drive the chief home because his\r\ncoachman had been too drunk to hold the reins.\r\n\r\n\"It's a miracle that he hasn't upset the boss a dozen times,\" said\r\nFabry, \"for he drives like a crazy creature when he's drunk. He should\r\nhave been sent off long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he would have been,\" said Mombleux, smiling, \"if certain ones\r\nwho wanted his help had not done all they could to keep him.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine became all attention.\r\n\r\n\"They'll make a face when they see that he's gone, but I'll give William\r\nhis due: he didn't know that he was spying.\"\r\n\r\nThey were silent while Zenobie came in to change the plates. They had\r\nnot thought that the pretty little girl in the corner was listening to\r\ntheir conversation. After Zenobie had left the room they went on with\r\ntheir talk.\r\n\r\n\"But what if the son returns?\" asked Mombleux.\r\n\r\n\"Well, most of us want him back, for the old man's getting old,\" said\r\nFabry; \"but perhaps he's dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might be,\" agreed Mombleux. \"Talouel's so ambitious he'd stop at\r\nnothing. He wants to own the place, and he'll get it if he can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and who knows? Maybe he had a hand in keeping M. Edmond away.\r\nNeither of us were here at the time, but you might be sure that Talouel\r\nwould work out things to his own interests.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and at that time he didn't know that there'd be others to take the\r\nplace of M. Edmond. I'm not sure what he's scheming to get, but it's\r\nsomething big.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he's doing some dirty work for sure, and only think, when he\r\nwas twenty years old he couldn't write his own name.\"\r\n\r\nRosalie came into the room at this moment and asked Perrine if she would\r\nlike to go on an errand with her. Perrine could not refuse. She had\r\nfinished her dinner some time ago, and if she remained in her corner she\r\nwould soon awaken their suspicions.\r\n\r\nIt was a quiet evening. The people sat at their street doors chatting.\r\nAfter Rosalie had finished her errand she wanted to go from one door to\r\nanother to gossip, but Perrine had no desire for this, and she excused\r\nherself on the plea of being tired. She did not want to go to bed. She\r\njust wanted to be alone, to think, in her little room, with the door\r\nclosed. She wanted to take a clear account of the situation in which she\r\nnow found herself.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard Fabry and Mombleux speaking of the manager she realized\r\nhow much she had to fear this man. He had given her to understand that\r\nhe was the master, and as such it was his right to be informed of all\r\nthat happened. But all that was nothing compared with what had been\r\nrevealed to her in the conversation that she had just heard.\r\n\r\nShe knew that he wished to exercise his authority over everyone. But she\r\nhad not known that his ambition was to take her grandfather's place some\r\nday. This man was scheming to replace the all-powerful master of the\r\nMaraucourt factories; for years he had plotted with this object in view.\r\nAll this she had just learned. The two men whose conversation she had\r\noverheard were in a position to know the facts. And this terrible man,\r\nnow that she had replaced William, intended that she should spy upon his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nWhat should she do? She was only a little girl, almost a child, and\r\nthere was no one to protect her. What should she do?\r\n\r\nShe had asked herself this question before, but under different\r\ncircumstances. It was impossible for her to lie down, so nervous and\r\nexcited was she at what she had heard.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this dreadful man had schemed to keep her dear dead father away\r\nfrom his home, and he was still working in an underhanded way for what?\r\nWas he trying to get out of the way the two nephews who would replace\r\nhis master? If he had the power to do this, what might he not do to her\r\nif she refused to spy for him?\r\n\r\nShe spent the greater part of the night turning these questions over in\r\nher little head. At last, tired out with the difficulties which\r\nconfronted her, she dropped her curly head on the pillow and slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM DACCA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing that M. Vulfran did upon reaching his office in the\r\nmorning was to open his mail. Domestic letters were arranged in one pile\r\nand foreign letters in another. Since he had gone blind his nephews or\r\nTalouel read the French mail aloud to him; the English letters were\r\ngiven to Fabry and the German to Mombleux.\r\n\r\nThe day following the conversation between Fabry and Mombleux which had\r\ncaused Perrine so much anxiety, M. Vulfran, his nephews and the manager\r\nwere occupied with the morning's mail. Suddenly Theodore exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"A letter from Dacca, dated May 29.\"\r\n\r\n\"In French?\" demanded M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"No, in English.\"\r\n\r\n\"What signature?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not very clear ... looks like Field. Fildes ... preceded by a word\r\nthat I can't make out. There are four pages. Your name occurs in several\r\nplaces, uncle. Shall I give it to Fabry?\"\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Theodore and Talouel cast a quick look at M. Vulfran,\r\nbut catching each other in this act, which betrayed that each was\r\nintensely curious, they both assumed an indifferent air.\r\n\r\n\"I'm putting the letter on your table, uncle,\" said Theodore.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to me,\" replied M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\nWhen the stenographer had gone off with the replies to the various\r\nletters, M. Vulfran dismissed his manager and his two nephews and rang\r\nfor Perrine.\r\n\r\nShe appeared immediately.\r\n\r\n\"What's in the letter?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe took the letter that he handed to her and glanced at it. If he could\r\nhave seen her he would have noticed that she had turned very pale and\r\nthat her hands trembled.\r\n\r\n\"It is an English letter, dated May 29, from Dacca,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"From whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Father Fields.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it say?\"\r\n\r\n\"May I read a few lines first, please ... before I tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but do it quickly.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to do as she was told, but her emotion increased as she read\r\n... the words dancing before her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" demanded M. Vulfran, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to read,\" she murmured, \"and difficult to understand;\r\nthe sentences are very long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't translate literally; just tell me what it is about.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE TRIED TO DO AS SHE WAS TOLD, BUT HER EMOTION\r\nINCREASED AS SHE READ.]\r\n\r\nThere was another long pause; at last she said:\r\n\r\n\"Father Fields says that Father Leclerc, to whom you wrote, is dead, and\r\nthat before dying he asked him to send this reply to you. He was\r\nunable to communicate with you before, as he had some difficulty in\r\ngetting together the facts that you desired. He excuses himself for\r\nwriting in English, as his knowledge of French is very slight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What information does he send?\" asked the blind man.\r\n\r\n\"I have not come to that yet, sir,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\nAlthough little Perrine gave this reply in a very gentle voice, the\r\nblind man knew that he would gain nothing by hurrying her.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" he said; \"not being in French, you must understand it\r\nthoroughly before you can explain it to me. You'd better take the letter\r\nand go into Bendit's office; translate it as accurately as you can,\r\nwriting it out so that you can read it to me. Don't lose a minute. I'm\r\nanxious to know what it contains.\"\r\n\r\nHe called her back as she was leaving.\r\n\r\n\"This letter relates to a personal matter,\" he said, \"and I do not wish\r\nanyone to know about it ... understand ... no one. If anyone dares\r\nquestion you about it, you must say nothing, nor give them any inkling\r\nof what it is about. You see what confidence I place in you. I hope that\r\nyou will prove yourself worthy of my trust. If you serve me faithfully,\r\nyou may be sure that you will be taken care of.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you, sir, that I'll deserve your trust,\" said Perrine,\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; now hurry.\"\r\n\r\nBut hurry she could not. She read the letter from beginning to end, then\r\nre-read it. Finally she took a large sheet of paper and commenced to\r\nwrite:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Dacca, May 29.\r\n\r\n    \"Honored Sir:\r\n\r\n    \"It is with great grief that I inform you that we have\r\n    lost our Reverend Father Leclerc, to whom you wrote for\r\n    certain important information. When dying he asked me to\r\n    send a reply to your letter, and I regret that it could\r\n    not have been sent earlier, but after a lapse of twelve\r\n    years I have had some difficulty in getting the facts\r\n    that you desire, and I must ask pardon for sending the\r\n    information I now have in English, as my knowledge of\r\n    French is very slight....\"\r\n\r\nPerrine, who had only read this far to M. Vulfran, now stopped to read\r\nand correct what she had done. She was giving all her attention to her\r\ntranslation when the office door was opened by Theodore Paindavoine. He\r\ncame into the room, closing the door after him, and asked for a French\r\nand English dictionary.\r\n\r\nThis dictionary was opened before her. She closed it and handed it to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not using it?\" he asked, coming close to her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I can manage without it,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really only need it to spell the French words correctly,\" she said,\r\n\"and a French dictionary will do as well.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew that he was standing just at the back of her, and although she\r\ncould not see his eyes, being afraid to turn round, she felt that he was\r\nreading over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you're translating that letter from Dacca?\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised that he knew about this letter which was to be kept a\r\nsecret. Then she realized that he was questioning her, and that his\r\nrequest for a dictionary was only a pretext. Why did he need an English\r\ndictionary if he could not understand a word of English?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Is the translation coming along all right?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe felt that he was bending over her, that his eyes were fixed on what\r\nshe had translated. Quickly she moved her paper, turning it so that he\r\ncould only see it sideways.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, sir,\" she exclaimed; \"don't read it. It is not correct ...\r\nit is all confused. I was just trying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, never mind that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I do mind. I should be ashamed to let you see this.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to take the sheet of paper, but she put both her small hands\r\nover it. She determined to hold her own even with one of the heads of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nUntil then he had spoken pleasantly to her.\r\n\r\n\"Now give it to me,\" he said briefly. \"I'm not playing schoolmaster with\r\na pretty little girl like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, it is impossible; I can't let you see it,\" she said\r\nobstinately.\r\n\r\nLaughingly he tried to take it from her, but she resisted him.\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not let you have it,\" she said with determination.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is a joke!\" replied Theodore.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a joke; I am very serious,\" said little Perrine. \"Monsieur\r\nVulfran forbade me to let anyone see this letter. I am obeying him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was I who opened it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter in English is not the translation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my uncle will show me this wonderful translation presently,\" he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"If your uncle shows it, very well; but that won't be me showing it. He\r\ngave me his orders and I must obey him.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw by her resolute attitude that if he wanted the paper he would\r\nhave to take it from her by force. But then, if he did so, she would\r\nprobably call out. He did not dare go as far as that.\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to see how faithfully you carry out my uncle's orders,\r\neven in trivial things,\" he said, sarcastically, leaving the room.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone and closed the door Perrine tried to go on with her\r\nwork, but she was so upset she found it impossible to do so. She knew\r\nthat Theodore was not delighted, as he had said, but furious. If he\r\nintended to make her pay for thwarting his will, how could she defend\r\nherself against such a powerful enemy? He could crush her with the first\r\nblow and she would have to leave.\r\n\r\nThe door was again opened and Talouel, with gliding step, came into the\r\nroom. His eyes fell at once on the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how is the translation of that letter from Dacca coming along?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have only just commenced it,\" replied Perrine timidly.\r\n\r\n\"M. Theodore interrupted you just now. What did he want?\"\r\n\r\n\"A French and English dictionary.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for? He doesn't know English.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not tell me why he wanted it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he want to know what was in the letter?\" asked Talouel.\r\n\r\n\"I had only commenced the first phrase,\" said Perrine, evasively.\r\n\r\n\"You don't ask me to believe that you have not read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not yet translated it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask you if you have read it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot reply to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because M. Vulfran has forbidden me to speak of this letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know very well that M. Vulfran and I are as one. All of his orders\r\npass by me; all favors that he bestows are also passed by me. I have to\r\nknow all that concerns him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even his personal affairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that letter relate to personal affairs then?\" asked Talouel.\r\n\r\nShe realized that she had let herself be caught.\r\n\r\n\"I did not say that,\" she said. \"I said that in case it was a personal\r\nletter, ought I to let you know the contents?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly should know,\" said Talouel, \"if it relates to personal\r\naffairs. Do you know that he is ill from worrying over matters which\r\nmight kill him? If he now received some news that might cause him great\r\nsorrow or great joy, it might prove fatal to him. He must not be told\r\nanything suddenly. That is why I ought to know beforehand anything that\r\nconcerns him, so as to prepare him. I could not do that if you read your\r\ntranslation straight off to him.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this in a suave, insinuating voice, very different from his\r\nordinary rough tones.\r\n\r\nShe was silent, looking up at him with an emotion which made her very\r\npale.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that you are intelligent enough to understand what I am telling\r\nyou,\" he continued. \"It is important for us, for the entire town, who\r\ndepend upon M. Vulfran for a livelihood, to consider his health. See\r\nwhat a good job you have now with him; in time it will be much better.\r\nWe, every one of us, must work for his good. He looks strong, but he is\r\nnot so strong as he appears, so much sorrow has undermined his health;\r\nand then the loss of his sight depresses him terribly. He places every\r\nconfidence in me, and I must see that nothing hurts him.\"\r\n\r\nIf Perrine had not known Talouel she might have been won by his words;\r\nbut after what she had heard the factory girls say about him, and the\r\ntalk that she had overheard between Fabry and Mombleux, who were men\r\nable to judge character, she felt that she could not believe in him. He\r\nwas not sincere. He wanted to make her talk, and he would attempt any\r\ndeceit and hypocrisy to gain his object.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran had told her that if she were questioned she must not let\r\nanyone know the contents of the letter. Evidently he had foreseen what\r\nmight happen. She must obey him.\r\n\r\nTalouel, leaning on her desk, fixed his eyes on her face. She needed all\r\nher courage; it seemed as though he were trying to hypnotize her. In a\r\nhoarse voice which betrayed her emotion, but which did not tremble,\r\nhowever, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Vulfran forbade me to speak of this letter to anyone.\"\r\n\r\nHer determined attitude made him furious, but controlling himself, he\r\nleaned over her again and said gently, but firmly: \"Yes, of course; but\r\nthen I'm not anyone. I am his other self.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not reply.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a fool?\" he cried at last in a stifled voice.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, understand,\" he said, roughly, \"you'd better show some\r\nintelligence if you want to hold this job that M. Vulfran has given you.\r\nIf you haven't any intelligence you can't hold the job, and instead of\r\nprotecting you, as I intended, it will be my duty to pack you off ...\r\nfire you! Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, think about it; think what your position is today and think what\r\nit will be tomorrow, turned out in the streets; then let me know what\r\nyou decide to do. Tell me this evening.\"\r\n\r\nThen as she showed no signs of weakening, he went out of the room with\r\nthe same gliding step with which he had entered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nA CABLE TO DACCA\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran was waiting for her. She had no time to think over what\r\nTalouel had threatened. She went on with her translation, hoping that\r\nher emotion would die down and leave her in a state better able to come\r\nto a decision as to what she should do. She continued to write:\r\n\r\n\"So much time has elapsed since the marriage of your son, M. Edmond\r\nPaindavoine, that I have had some difficulty in getting together the\r\nfacts. It was our own Father Leclerc who performed this marriage.\r\n\r\n\"The lady who became your son's wife was endowed with the finest womanly\r\nqualities. She was upright, kind, charming; added to these qualities,\r\nshe was gifted with remarkable personal charms. The time is past when\r\nall the knowledge the Hindu woman possessed consisted in the art of\r\nbeing graceful and the science of etiquette of their social world. Today\r\nthe Hindu woman's mind is cultivated to a remarkable degree. Your son's\r\nwife was a highly educated girl. Her father and mother were of the\r\nBrahmin faith, but Father Leclerc had the joy of converting them to our\r\nown religion. Unfortunately, when a Hindu is converted to our religion\r\nhe loses his caste, his rank, his standing in social life. This was the\r\ncase with the family whose daughter married your son. By becoming\r\nChristians, they became to a certain extent outcasts.\r\n\r\n\"So you will quite understand that being cast off by the all-powerful\r\nHindu world, this charming girl, who was now a Christian, should turn\r\nand take her place in European society. Her father went into partnership\r\nwith a well-known French exporter, and the firm was known as Doressany\r\n(Hindu) & Bercher (French).\r\n\r\n\"It was in the home of Madame Bercher that your son met Marie Doressany\r\nand fell in love with her. Everybody spoke in the highest praise of this\r\nyoung lady. I did not know her, for I came to Dacca after she left. Why\r\nthere should have been any obstacle to this union I cannot say. That is\r\na matter I must not discuss. Although there were, however, objections,\r\nthe marriage took place and in our own Chapel. The Reverend Father\r\nLeclerc bestowed the nuptial blessing upon the marriage of your son and\r\nMarie Doressany. This marriage was recorded in our registers, and a copy\r\nof it can be sent to you if you wish.\r\n\r\n\"For four years your son Edmond lived at the home of his wife's parents.\r\nThere a little girl was born to the young couple. Everyone who remembers\r\nthem speaks of them, as a model couple, and like all young people, they\r\ntook part in the social pleasures of their world.\r\n\r\n\"For some time the firm of Doressany & Bercher prospered, then hard\r\ntimes came, and after several bad seasons the firm was ruined. M. and\r\nMme. Doressany died at some months' interval, and Monsieur Bercher with\r\nhis family returned to France. Your son then traveled to Dalhousie as\r\ncollector of plants and antiquities for various English houses. He took\r\nwith him his young wife and his little girl, who was about three years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\"He did not return to Dacca, but I learn from one of his friends to whom\r\nhe has written several times, and from Father Leclerc, who wrote\r\nregularly to Mme. Paindavoine, that they had a villa at Dehra. They\r\nselected this spot to live in as it was the center of his voyages; he\r\ntraveled between the Thiberian frontier and the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know Dehra, but we have a mission in this town, and if you\r\nthink it might help in our researches I shall be pleased to send you a\r\nletter for one of the Fathers whose help might be useful in this\r\nmatter....\"\r\n\r\nAt last the letter was finished. The moment she had translated the last\r\nword, without even waiting to write the polite ending, she gathered up\r\nher sheets and went quickly to M. Vulfran's office. She found him\r\nwalking back and forth the length of the room, counting his steps as\r\nmuch to avoid bumping against the wall as to curb his impatience.\r\n\r\n\"You have been very slow,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The letter was long and difficult,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"And you were interrupted, were you not? I heard the door of your office\r\nopen and close twice.\"\r\n\r\nSince he put the question to her, she thought that she ought to reply\r\ntruthfully. It would solve the problem that had caused her so much\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Theodore and Monsieur Talouel came into the office,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!...\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed as though he wanted to say more, but refrained.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the letter first,\" he said, \"and we'll see to the other matter\r\nafter. Sit down beside me and read slowly. Don't raise your voice.\"\r\n\r\nShe read. Her voice was somewhat weak.\r\n\r\nAs she read the blind man murmured to himself from time to time: \"Model\r\ncouple\" ... \"social pleasures\" ... \"English houses\" ... \"which?\" ...\r\n\"One of his friends\" ... \"Which friend?\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished there was a silence. Finally M. Vulfran spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Can you translate into English as well as you translate English into\r\nFrench?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can do it if the phrases are not too difficult,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"A cable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sit down at that little table and write.\"\r\n\r\nHe dictated in French:\r\n\r\n    \"Father Fields' Mission, Dacca:\r\n\r\n    \"Thanks for letter. Please send by cable, reply prepaid,\r\n    twenty words ... name of friend who received last news,\r\n    date of letter. Send also name of the Reverend Father\r\n    at Dehra. Inform him that I shall write him immediately.\r\n    Paindavoine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Translate that into English and make it shorter rather than longer, if\r\npossible. At one franc sixty centimes a word, we must not waste words.\r\nWrite very clearly.\"\r\n\r\nThe translation was quickly made.\r\n\r\n\"How many words?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"In English ... thirty-seven.\"\r\n\r\nHe made the calculation for the message and for the return answer.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said to Perrine, giving her the money, \"take it yourself to\r\nthe telegraph office, hand it in and see that no mistakes are made by\r\nthe receiver.\"\r\n\r\nAs she crossed the veranda she saw Talouel, who, with his hands thrust\r\nin his pockets, was strolling about as though on the lookout for all\r\nthat passed in the yards as well as in the offices.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"To the cable office with a message,\" replied Perrine. She held the\r\npaper in one hand and the money in the other. He took the paper from\r\nher, snatching it so roughly that if she had not let it go he would have\r\ntorn it. He hastily opened it. His face flushed with anger when he saw\r\nthat the message was written in English.\r\n\r\n\"You know that you've got to talk with me later on, eh?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not see M. Vulfran again before three o'clock, when he rang for\r\nher to go out. She had wondered who would replace William, and she was\r\nvery surprised when M. Vulfran told her to take her seat beside him,\r\nafter having sent away the coachman who had brought old Coco around.\r\n\r\n\"As you drove him so well yesterday, there is no reason why you should\r\nnot drive him well today,\" said M. Vulfran. \"Besides, I want to talk to\r\nyou, and it is better for us to be alone like this.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until they had left behind the village, where their\r\nappearance excited the same curiosity as the evening before, and were\r\ngoing at a gentle trot along the lanes, that M. Vulfran began to talk.\r\nPerrine would like to have put off this moment; she was very nervous.\r\n\r\n\"You told me that M. Theodore and Talouel came into your office?\" said\r\nthe blind man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did they want?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. Her little face wore a very worried look.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you hesitate?\" asked the blind man. \"Don't you think that you\r\nought to tell me everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Perrine, fervently. Was this not the best way to\r\nsolve her difficulties? She told what had happened when Theodore had\r\ncome into the office.\r\n\r\n\"Was that all?\" asked M. Vulfran, when she stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; that was all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Talouel?\"\r\n\r\nAgain she told exactly what had occurred, only omitting to tell him that\r\nTalouel had said that a sudden announcement of news, good or bad, might\r\nprove fatal to him. She then told him what had passed regarding the\r\ncable; and also that Talouel said he was going to talk with her after\r\nwork that same day.\r\n\r\nAs she talked she had let old Coco go at her own will, and the old\r\nhorse, taking advantage of her freedom, shambled along calmly from one\r\nside of the road to the other, sniffing the odor of the warm hay that\r\nthe breeze wafted to his nostrils.\r\n\r\nWhen Perrine stopped talking her grandfather remained silent for some\r\ntime. Knowing that he could not see her, she fixed her eyes on his face\r\nand she read in his expression as much sadness as annoyance.\r\n\r\n\"No harm shall come to you,\" he said at last. \"I shall not mention what\r\nyou have told me, and if anyone wants to take revenge on you for\r\nopposing their attempts I shall be near to protect you. I thought\r\nsomething like this would happen, but it will not occur a second time.\r\nIn the future you will sit at the little table that is in my office. I\r\nhardly think that they'll try to question you before me. But as they\r\nmight try to do so after you leave off work, over at Mother Françoise's\r\nwhere you eat, I shall take you to my home to live with me. You will\r\nhave a room in the chateau, and you will eat at my table. As I am\r\nexpecting to have some correspondence with persons in India, and I\r\nshall receive letters in English and cables, you alone will know about\r\nthem. I must take every precaution, for they will do their utmost to\r\nmake you talk. I shall be able to protect you if you are by my side;\r\nbesides, this will be my reply to those who try to force you to speak,\r\nas well as a warning if they still try to tempt you. Then, also, it will\r\nbe a reward for you.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine, who had been trembling with anxiety when M. Vulfran commenced\r\nto speak, was now so overcome with joy that she could find no words with\r\nwhich to reply.\r\n\r\n\"I had faith in you, child,\" continued the old man, \"from the moment I\r\nknew what struggle you had made against poverty. When one is as brave as\r\nyou, one is honest. You have proved to me that I have not made a\r\nmistake, and that I can be proud of you. It is as though I have known\r\nyou for years. I am a very lonely and unhappy man. What is my wealth to\r\nme? It is a heavy burden if you have not the health to enjoy it. And yet\r\nthere are those who envy me. There are seven thousand men and women who\r\ndepend upon me for a living. If I failed there would be misery and\r\nhunger and perhaps death for many. I must keep up for them. I must\r\nuphold the honor of this house which I have built up, little by little.\r\nIt is my joy, my pride ... and yet ... I am blind!\"\r\n\r\nThe last words were said with such bitterness that Perrine's eyes filled\r\nwith tears. The blind man continued: \"You ought to know from village\r\ntalk and from the letter that you translated that I have a son. My son\r\nand I disagreed. We parted; there were many reasons for us doing so. He\r\nthen married against my wishes and our separation was complete. But with\r\nall this my affection for him has not changed. I love him after all\r\nthese years of absence as though he were still the little boy I brought\r\nup, and when I think of him, which is day and night, it is the little\r\nboy that I see with my sightless eyes. My son preferred that woman to\r\nhis own father. Instead of coming back to me he preferred to live with\r\nher because I would not, or could not, receive her. I hoped that he\r\nwould give in, but he thought probably that I in time would give in. We\r\nhave both the same characters. I have had no news from him. After my\r\nillness, of which I am sure he knew, for I have every reason to believe\r\nthat he has been kept informed of all that happens here, I thought that\r\nhe would come back to me, but he has not returned. That wretched woman\r\nevidently holds him back. She is not content with having taken him from\r\nme, she keeps him ... the wretch....\"\r\n\r\nThe blind man stopped. Perrine, who had been hanging on his words, had\r\nscarcely breathed, but at the last words she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"The letter from Father Fields said that she was a lady, honorable and\r\nupright. He does not speak of her as a wretch.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the letter says cannot go against facts,\" said the blind man,\r\nobstinately. \"The main fact which has made me hate her is that she keeps\r\nmy son from me. A creature of her kind should efface herself and let him\r\nreturn and take up again the life which is his. It is through her that\r\nwe are parted. I have tried to find him, but I cannot. He must come back\r\nand take his place. You may not understand all I tell you, my child, but\r\nwhen I die my whole fortune must go to my son. He is my heir. When I die\r\nwho will take my place if he is not here? Can you understand what I am\r\nsaying, little girl?\" said the old man, almost entreatingly.\r\n\r\n\"I think so, sir,\" said Perrine gently.\r\n\r\n\"But there, I don't wish you to understand entirely. There are those\r\naround me who ought to help me. There are certain ones who do not want\r\nmy boy to return; it is to their interest that he should not come back,\r\nso they try to think that he is dead. My boy dead! Could he be? Could\r\nGod strike me such a terrible blow? They try to believe it, but I will\r\nnot. No, I will not! It can't be! Oh, what should I do if my boy was\r\ndead!\"\r\n\r\nPerrine's eyes were no longer fixed on the blind man's face; she had\r\nturned her face from him as though he could see her own.\r\n\r\n\"I talk to you frankly, little girl,\" continued the old man, \"because I\r\nneed your help. They are going to try and tempt you again to spy for\r\nthem. I have warned you; that is all that I can do.\"\r\n\r\nThey could now see the factory chimneys of Fercheux. Still a few more\r\nrods and they came to the village. Perrine, who was trembling, could\r\nonly find words to say in a broken voice: \"Monsieur Vulfran, you may\r\ntrust me. I will serve you faithfully with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nGRANDFATHER'S COMPANION\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, when the tour of the factories was over, instead of\r\nreturning to his office as was his custom, M. Vulfran told Perrine to\r\ndrive straight to the chateau.\r\n\r\nFor the first time she passed through the magnificent iron gates, a\r\nmasterpiece of skill that a king had coveted, so it was said, these\r\nwonderful iron gates which one of France's richest merchants had bought\r\nfor his chateau.\r\n\r\n\"Follow the main driveway,\" said M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\nFor the first time also she saw close to the beautiful flowers and the\r\nvelvety lawns which until then she had only seen from a distance. The\r\nbeautiful blossoms, red and pink masses, seemed like great splashes on\r\nthe verdure. Accustomed to take this road, old Coco trotted along\r\ncalmly, and as there was no occasion to guide her, Perrine was able to\r\ngaze right and left of her and admire the flowers, plants and shrubs in\r\nall their beauty. Although their master could not see them as formerly,\r\nthe same attention and skill was showered upon them.\r\n\r\nOf her own accord, Coco stopped before the wide steps where an old\r\nservant, warned by the lodge-keeper's bell, stood waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Are you there, Bastien?\" asked M. Vulfran, without getting down.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take this young girl to the butterfly room, which is to be hers in\r\nthe future. See that everything is given to her that she needs. Set her\r\nplate opposite to mine at table. Now send Felix to me. I want him to\r\ndrive me to the office.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine thought that she was dreaming.\r\n\r\n\"We dine at eight o'clock,\" said M. Vulfran. \"Until then you are free to\r\ndo as you like.\"\r\n\r\nShe got out of the carriage quickly and followed the old butler. She was\r\nso dazed that it was as though she had suddenly been set down in an\r\nenchanted palace.\r\n\r\nAnd was not this beautiful chateau like a palace? The monumental hall,\r\nfrom which rose a wonderful stairway of white marble, up which ran a\r\ncrimson carpet, was a delight to the eyes. On each landing exquisite\r\nflowers and plants were grouped artistically in pots and jardinieres.\r\nTheir perfume filled the air.\r\n\r\nBastien took her to the second floor, and without entering opened the\r\ndoor of a room for her.\r\n\r\n\"I'll send the chambermaid to you,\" he said, leaving her.\r\n\r\nShe passed through a somber little hall, then found herself in a very\r\nlarge room draped with ivory colored cretonne patterned with butterflies\r\nin vivid shades. The furniture was ivory colored wood, and the carpet\r\ngray, with clusters of wild flowers, primrose, poppies, cornflowers and\r\nbuttercups.\r\n\r\nHow pretty and dainty it was!\r\n\r\nShe was still in a dream, pushing her feet into the soft carpet, when\r\nthe maid entered.\r\n\r\n\"Bastien told me that I was to be at your service, mademoiselle,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHere stood a chambermaid in a clean light dress and a muslin cap at her\r\nservice ... she who only a few days before had slept in a hut on a bed\r\nof ferns with rats and frogs scampering about her.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said at last, collecting her wits, \"but I do not need\r\nanything ... at least I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you like I will show you the apartment,\" said the maid.\r\n\r\nWhat she meant by \"show the apartment\" was to throw open the doors of a\r\nbig wardrobe with glass doors, and a closet, then to pull out the\r\ndrawers of the dressing table in which were brushes, scissors, soaps and\r\nbottles, etc. That done, she showed Perrine two knobs on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"This one is for the lights,\" she said, flashing on the electric light,\r\n\"and this one is the bell if you need anything.\r\n\r\n\"If you need Bastien,\" she explained, \"you have to ring once, and if you\r\nneed me, ring twice.\"\r\n\r\nHow much had happened in a few hours! Who would have thought when she\r\ntook her stand against Theodore and Talouel that the wind was going to\r\nblow so favorably in her direction. How amusing it was ... their ill\r\nfeeling towards her had itself brought her this good luck.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that young girl did something foolish?\" said Talouel, meeting\r\nhis employer at the foot of the steps. \"I see she has not returned with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; she did not,\" replied M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"But if Felix drove you back?...\"\r\n\r\n\"As I passed the chateau I dropped her there so that she would have time\r\nto get ready for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner? Oh, I suppose....\"\r\n\r\nHe was gasping with amazement, and for once he could not say what he did\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\n\"You do nothing but 'suppose',\" said M. Vulfran, tartly. \"I may as well\r\ntell you that for a long time I have wanted someone intelligent to be\r\nnear me, one who is discreet and whom I can trust. This young girl seems\r\nto have these qualities. I am sure that she is intelligent, and I have\r\nalready had the proof that I can trust her.\"\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran's tone was significant. Talouel could not misunderstand the\r\nsense of his words.\r\n\r\n\"I am taking her to live with me,\" continued M. Vulfran, \"because I know\r\nthat there are those who are trying to tempt her. She is not one to\r\nyield, but I do not intend that she should run any risk at their hands.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were said with even greater significance.\r\n\r\n\"She will stay with me altogether now,\" continued M. Vulfran. \"She will\r\nwork here in my office; during the day she will accompany me; she will\r\neat at my table. I shall not be so lonesome at my meals, for her chatter\r\nwill entertain me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose she will give you all the satisfaction that you expect,\"\r\nremarked Talouel suavely.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so also,\" replied his employer, very drily.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Perrine, leaning with her elbows on the window sill, looked\r\nout dreamily over the beautiful garden, at the factories beyond the\r\nvillage with its houses and church, the meadows in which the silvery\r\nwater glistened in the oblique rays of the setting sun; and then her\r\neyes turned in the opposite direction, to the woods where she had sat\r\ndown the day she had come, and where in the evening breeze she had\r\nseemed to hear the soft voice of her mother murmuring, \"I know you will\r\nbe happy.\"\r\n\r\nHer dear mother had foreseen the future, and the big daisies had also\r\nspoken true. Yes, she was beginning to be happy. She must be patient and\r\nall would come right in time. She need not hurry matters now. There was\r\nno poverty, no hunger or thirst, in this beautiful chateau where she had\r\nentered so quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen the factory whistle announced the closing hour she was still\r\nstanding at her window, deep in thought. The piercing whistle recalled\r\nher from the future to the present.\r\n\r\nAlong the white roads between the fields she saw a black swarm of\r\nworkers, first a great compact mass, then gradually it grew smaller, as\r\nthey dwindled off in different directions in groups towards their homes.\r\n\r\nOld Coco's gentle trot was soon heard on the drive, and Perrine saw her\r\nblind grandfather returning to his home.\r\n\r\nShe gave herself a real wash with eau de Cologne as well as soap, a\r\ndelicious perfume soap. It was not until the clock on the mantle shelf\r\nstruck eight that she went down.\r\n\r\nShe wondered how she would find the dining room. She did not have to\r\nlook for it, however. A footman in a black coat, who was standing in the\r\nhall, showed her the way. Almost immediately M. Vulfran came in. No one\r\nguided him. He seemed to have no difficulty in finding his way to his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nA bowl of beautiful orchids stood in the middle of the table, which was\r\ncovered with massive silver and cut glass, which gleamed in the lights\r\nthat fell from the crystal chandelier.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she stood behind her chair, not knowing what to do. M.\r\nVulfran seemed to sense her attitude.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was served at once. The servant who had shown her the way to\r\nthe dining room put a plate of soup before her, while Bastien brought\r\nanother to his master which was full to the brim.\r\n\r\nIf she had been dining there alone with M. Vulfran she would have been\r\nquite at her ease, but the inquisitive glances the servants cast at her\r\nmade her feel deeply embarrassed. Probably they were wondering how a\r\nlittle tramp like her would eat.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, she made no mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was very simple--soup, roast lamb, green peas and salad--but\r\nthere was abundance of dessert ... two or three raised stands of\r\ndelicious fruit and cakes.\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow, if you like, you may go and see the hot houses where these\r\nfruits are grown,\" said M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\nPerrine thanked him and said she would like to.\r\n\r\nShe had commenced by helping herself discreetly to some cherries. M.\r\nVulfran wished her also to take some apricots, peaches and grapes.\r\n\r\n\"Take all you want,\" he said. \"At your age I should have eaten all the\r\nfruit that is on the table ... if it had been offered to me.\"\r\n\r\nBastien selected an apricot and peach and placed them before Perrine as\r\nhe might have done for an intelligent monkey, just to see how the\r\n\"little animal\" would eat.\r\n\r\nBut despite the delicious fruit, Perrine was very pleased when the\r\ndinner came to an end. She hoped that the next day the servants would\r\nnot stare so much.\r\n\r\n\"Now you are free until tomorrow,\" said M. Vulfran, rising from his\r\nseat. \"It is moonlight, and you can go for a stroll in the garden, or\r\nread in the library, or take a book up to your own room.\"\r\n\r\nShe was embarrassed, wondering if she ought not to tell M. Vulfran that\r\nshe would do as he wished. While she stood hesitating she saw Bastien\r\nmaking signs to her which at first she did not understand. He held an\r\nimaginary book in one hand and appeared to be turning the pages with the\r\nother, then glanced at M. Vulfran and moved his lips as though he were\r\nreading. Suddenly Perrine understood. She was to ask if she might read\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"But don't you need me, sir?\" she said, timidly. \"Would you not like me\r\nto read to you?\"\r\n\r\nBastien nodded his head in approval. He seemed delighted that she had\r\nguessed what he had tried to explain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you need some time to yourself,\" replied M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that I am not at all tired,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said the blind man; \"follow me into the study.\"\r\n\r\nThe library was a big somber room separated from the dining room by the\r\nhall. There was a strip of carpet laid from one room to the other, which\r\nwas a guide for the blind man. He now walked direct to the room\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nPerrine had wondered how he spent his time when he was alone, as he\r\ncould not read. From the appearance of the room one could not guess, for\r\nthe large table was covered with papers and magazines. Before the window\r\nstood a large Voltaire chair, upholstered in tapestry. The chair was\r\nrather worn. This seemed to indicate that the blind man sat for long\r\nhours face to face with the sky, the clouds of which he could never see.\r\n\r\n\"What could you read to me?\" he asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"A newspaper,\" she said, \"if you wish. There are some on the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"The less time one gives to the newspapers the better,\" he replied. \"Do\r\nyou like books on travels?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; I do,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I do, too,\" he said. \"They amuse one as well as instruct one.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as though speaking to himself, as though unaware of her presence,\r\nhe said softly: \"Get away from yourself. Get interested in another life\r\nthan your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll read from 'Around the World',\" he said. He led her to a bookcase\r\nwhich contained several volumes on travels and told her to look in the\r\nindex.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I look for?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Look in the I's ... for the word India.\"\r\n\r\nThus he was following his own thoughts. How could he live the life of\r\nanother? His one thought was of his son. He now wanted to read about the\r\ncountry where his boy lived.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what you find,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe read aloud the various headings concerning India. He told her which\r\nvolume to take. As she was about to take it she stood as though\r\ntransfixed, gazing at a portrait hanging over the fireplace which her\r\neyes, gradually becoming accustomed to the dim light, had not seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you silent?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am looking at the portrait over the mantel shelf,\" she said, in a\r\ntrembling voice.\r\n\r\n\"That was my son when he was twenty,\" said the old gentleman; \"but you\r\ncan't see it very well. I'll light up.\"\r\n\r\nHe touched the electric knob and the room was flooded with light.\r\nPerrine, who had taken a few steps nearer, uttered a cry and let the\r\nbook of travels fall to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, but stood there with her eyes fixed on the picture of\r\na fair young man dressed in a hunting suit leaning with one hand on a\r\ngun and the other stroking the head of a black spaniel.\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room, then the blind man heard a little sob.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you crying?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nPerrine did not reply for a moment. With an effort she tried to control\r\nher emotion.\r\n\r\n\"It is the picture ... your son ... you are his father?\" she stammered.\r\n\r\nAt first he did not understand, then in a voice that was strangely\r\nsympathetic he said:\r\n\r\n\"And you ... you were thinking of your father, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, sir; I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little girl,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nGETTING AN EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Theodore and Casimir entered their uncle's office\r\nto attend to the correspondence, they were amazed to see Perrine\r\ninstalled at her table as though she were a fixture there.\r\n\r\nTalouel had taken care not to tell them, but he had contrived to be\r\npresent when they entered so as to witness their discomfiture. The sight\r\nof their amazement gave him considerable enjoyment. Although he was\r\nfurious at the way this little beggar girl had imposed, as he thought,\r\nupon the senile weakness of an old man, it was at least some\r\ncompensation to know that the two nephews felt the same astonishment and\r\nindignation that he had.\r\n\r\nEvidently they did not understand her presence in this sacred office,\r\nwhere they themselves only remained just the time necessary to report on\r\nthe business of which they were in charge.\r\n\r\nTheodore and Casimir looked in dismay at one another, but they did not\r\ndare ask questions. Talouel left the room the same time as they.\r\n\r\n\"You were surprised to see that girl in the boss' office, eh?\" he said,\r\nwhen they got outside.\r\n\r\nThey did not deign to reply.\r\n\r\n\"If you had not come in late this morning, I should have let you know\r\nthat she was there, and then you would not have looked so taken back.\r\nShe noticed how surprised you were.\"\r\n\r\nHe had managed to give them two little knocks: First, there was a gentle\r\nscolding for them being late; secondly, he had let them see that he, a\r\nforeman, had noticed that they had been unable to hide their\r\ndiscomfiture and that the girl had noticed it, too. And they were M.\r\nVulfran's nephews! Ah! ha!\r\n\r\n\"M. Vulfran told me yesterday that he had taken that girl to live at the\r\nchateau with him, and that in the future she would work in his office.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'd like to know. I don't think your uncle knows either. He\r\ntold me he wanted someone to be with him whom he could trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't he got us?\" asked Casimir.\r\n\r\n\"That is just what I said to him. I mentioned you both, and do you know\r\nwhat he replied?\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to pause to give more effect to his words, but he was afraid\r\nthat they would turn their backs upon him before he had said what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, my nephews,' he said, 'and what are they?' From the tone in which\r\nhe said those few words I thought it better not to reply,\" continued\r\nTalouel. \"He told me then that he intended to have that girl up at the\r\nchateau with him because there was someone trying to tempt her to tell\r\nsomething that she should not tell. He said he knew that she could be\r\ntrusted, but he said he didn't like others that he could not trust to\r\nput the girl in such a position. He said she had already proved to him\r\nthat she could be trusted. I wonder who he meant had tried to tempt her?\r\n\r\n\"I thought it my duty to tell you this, because while M. Edmond is away\r\nyou two take his place,\" added Talouel.\r\n\r\nHe had given them several thrusts, but he wanted to give them one last\r\nsharp knock.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, M. Edmond might return at any moment,\" he said. \"I believe\r\nthat your uncle is on the right track at last. He has been making\r\ninquiries, and from the looks of things I think we shall have him back\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you heard? Anything?\" asked Theodore, who could not restrain\r\nhis curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I keep my eyes open,\" said Talouel, \"and I can tell you that that\r\ngirl is doing a lot of translating in the way of letters and cables that\r\ncome from India.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment he looked from a window and saw a telegraph boy strolling\r\nup to the office.\r\n\r\n\"Here is another cable coming,\" he said. \"This is a reply to one that\r\nhas been sent to Dacca. It must be very annoying for you not to be able\r\nto speak English. You could be the first to announce to the boss that\r\nyour cousin will be coming back. Now that little tramp will be the one\r\nto do it.\"\r\n\r\nTalouel hurried forward to meet the telegraph boy.\r\n\r\n\"Say, you don't hurry yourself, do you?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me to kill myself?\" asked the boy, insolently.\r\n\r\nHe hurried with the message to M. Vulfran's office.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I open it, sir?\" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do,\" said M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is in English,\" replied Talouel, as he looked at the missive.\r\n\r\n\"Then Aurelie must attend to it,\" said M. Vulfran, and with a wave of\r\nhis hand dismissed the manager.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the door had closed Perrine translated the cable.\r\n\r\nIt read: \"Friend Leserre, a French merchant. Last news from Dehra five\r\nyears. Wrote Father Makerness according to your wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five years,\" cried M. Vulfran. Then, as he was not the sort of man to\r\nwaste time in regrets, he said to Perrine: \"Write two cables, one to M.\r\nLeserre in French and one to Father Makerness in English.\"\r\n\r\nShe quickly wrote the cable that she had to translate into English, but\r\nshe asked if she could get a dictionary from Bendit's office before she\r\ndid the one in French.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not sure of your spelling?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not at all sure,\" she replied, \"and I should not like them at\r\nthe office to make fun of any message that is sent by you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you would not be able to write a letter without making mistakes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I know I should make a lot of mistakes. I can spell French words\r\nall right at the commencement, but the endings I find very difficult. I\r\nfind it much easier to write in English, and I think I ought to tell you\r\nso now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you never been to school?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never. I only know what my father and mother taught me. When we\r\nstopped on the roads they used to make me study, but I never studied\r\nvery much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a good girl to tell me so frankly. We must see to that, but for\r\nthe moment let us attend to what we have on hand.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until the afternoon, when they were driving out, that he\r\nagain referred to her spelling.\r\n\r\n\"Have you written to your relations yet?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I would like nothing better than to stay here with you, who are\r\nso kind to me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't want to leave me?\" asked the blind man.\r\n\r\n\"No, I want to help you all I can,\" said Perrine softly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then you must study so as to be able to act as a little\r\nsecretary for me. Would you like to be educated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I would! And I will work so hard,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the matter can be arranged without depriving myself of your\r\nservices,\" said M. Vulfran; \"there is a very good teacher here and I\r\nwill ask her to give you lessons from six to eight in the evenings. She\r\nis a very nice woman; there are only two things against her; they are\r\nher height and her name; she is taller than I am, and her shoulders are\r\nmuch broader than mine. Her name is Mademoiselle Belhomme. She is indeed\r\na _bel homme_, for although she is only forty her shoulders and figure\r\nare more massive than any man's I know ... I must add that she has not a\r\nbeard.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine smiled at this description of the teacher that she was to have.\r\n\r\nAfter they had made a tour of the factories they stopped before a girl's\r\nschool and Mlle. Belhomme ran out to greet M. Vulfran. He expressed a\r\nwish to get down and go into the school and speak with her. Perrine, who\r\nfollowed in their footsteps, was able to examine her. She was indeed a\r\ngiant, but her manner seemed very womanly and dignified. At times her\r\nmanner was almost timid and did not accord at all with her appearance.\r\n\r\nNaturally she could not refuse anything the all-powerful master of\r\nMaraucourt asked, but even if she had had any reasons to refuse M.\r\nVulfran's request the little girl with the beautiful eyes and hair\r\npleased her very much.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said to M. Vulfran, \"we will make her an educated girl. Do\r\nyou know she has eyes like a gazelle. I have never seen a gazelle, but I\r\nshould imagine their great brown eyes are like hers. They are\r\nwonderful....\"\r\n\r\nThe next day when M. Vulfran returned to his home at the dinner hour he\r\nasked the governess what she thought of her new pupil. Mlle. Belhomme\r\nwas most enthusiastic in her praise of Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Does she show any intelligence?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Why she is wonderfully intelligent,\" replied Mlle. Belhomme; \"it would\r\nhave been such a calamity if she had remained without an education....\"\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran smiled at Mlle. Belhomme's words.\r\n\r\n\"What about her spelling?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is very poor but she'll do better. Her writing is fairly good\r\nbut, of course, she needs to study hard. She is so intelligent it is\r\nextraordinary. So as to know exactly what she knew in writing and\r\nspelling I asked her to write me an account of Maraucourt. In twenty to\r\na hundred lines I asked her to describe the village to me. She sat down\r\nand wrote. Her pen flew over the paper; she did not hesitate for words;\r\nshe wrote four long pages; she described the factories, the scenery,\r\nevery thing clearly and in detail. She wrote about the birds and the\r\nfishes over near the pond, and about the morning mists that cover the\r\nfields and the water. Then of the calm, quiet evenings. Had I not seen\r\nher writing it I should have thought that she had copied it from some\r\ngood author. Unfortunately the spelling and writing is very poor but, as\r\nI said, that does not matter. That is merely a matter of a few months,\r\nwhilst all the lessons in the world would not teach her how to write if\r\nshe had not been gifted with the sense of feeling and seeing in such a\r\nremarkable manner; that she can convey to others what she feels and\r\nsees. If you have time to let me read it to you, you will see that I\r\nhave not exaggerated.\"\r\n\r\nThe governess read Perrine's narrative to him. He was delighted. He had\r\nwondered once or twice if he had been wise in so promptly befriending\r\nthis little girl and giving her a place in his home. It had appeared to\r\nhim strange the sudden fancy that he had taken to her.\r\n\r\nHe told Mlle. Belhomme how her little pupil had lived in a cabin in one\r\nof the fields, and how, with nothing except what she found on hand, she\r\ncontrived to make kitchen utensils and shoes, and how she had made her\r\nmeals of the fish, herbs and fruit that she found.\r\n\r\nMlle. Belhomme's kind face beamed as the blind man talked. She was\r\ngreatly interested in what he told her. When M. Vulfran stopped the\r\ngoverness remained silent, thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think,\" she said at last, \"that to know how to create the\r\nnecessities that one needs is a master quality to be desired above all?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do, and it was precisely because that child could do that\r\nthat I first took an interest in her. Ask her some time to tell you her\r\nstory and you will see that it required some energy and courage for her\r\nto arrive where she is now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she has received her reward since she has been able to interest\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am interested, and already attached to her. I am glad that you\r\nlike her, and I hope that you will do all that you can with her.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine made great progress with her studies. She was interested in\r\neverything her governess had to tell her, but her beautiful eyes\r\nbetrayed the greatest interest when Mlle. Belhomme talked of her\r\ngrandfather. Many times Perrine had spoken of M. Vulfran's illness to\r\nRosalie, but she had only received vague replies to her queries; now,\r\nfrom her governess, she learned all the details regarding his\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\nLike everyone at Maraucourt, Mlle. Belhomme was concerned with M.\r\nVulfran's health, and she had often spoken with Dr. Ruchon so she was in\r\na position to satisfy Perrine's curiosity better than Rosalie could.\r\n\r\nHer grandfather had a double cataract. It was not incurable; if he were\r\noperated upon he might recover his sight. The operation had not yet been\r\nattempted because his health would not allow it.... He was suffering\r\nfrom bronchial trouble, and if the operation was to be a success he\r\nwould have to be in a perfect state of health. But M. Vulfran was\r\nimprudent. He was not careful enough in following the doctor's orders.\r\nHow could he remain calm, as Dr. Ruchon recommended, when he was always\r\nworked up to a fever of anxiety over the continued absence of his son.\r\nSo long as he was not sure of his son's fate, there was no chance for\r\nthe operation and it was put off. But ... would it be possible to have\r\nit later? That the oculists could not decide. They were uncertain, so\r\nlong as the blind man's health continued in this precarious state.\r\n\r\nBut when Mlle. Belhomme saw that Perrine was also anxious to talk about\r\nTalouel and the two nephews and their hopes regarding the business she\r\nwas not so communicative. It was quite natural that the girl should show\r\nan interest in her benefactor, but that she should be interested in the\r\nvillage gossip was not permissible. Certainly it was not a conversation\r\nfor a governess and her pupil.... It was not with talks of this kind\r\nthat one should mould the character of a young girl.\r\n\r\nPerrine would have had to renounce all hope of getting any information\r\nfrom her governess if Casimir's mother, Madame Bretoneux, had not\r\ndecided to come to the chateau on a visit. This coming visit opened the\r\nlips of Mlle. Belhomme, which otherwise would certainly have remained\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the governess heard that Mme. Bretoneux was coming she had a\r\nvery serious talk with her little pupil.\r\n\r\n\"My dear child,\" she said, lowering her voice, \"I must give you some\r\nadvice; I want you to be very reserved with this lady who is coming here\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reserved, about what?\" asked Perrine in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Vulfran did not only ask me to take charge of your education\r\nbut to take a personal interest in you; that is why I give you this\r\nadvice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Mademoiselle, explain to me what I ought to do,\" said Perrine;\r\n\"I don't understand at all what this advice means, and I am very\r\nnervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although you have not been very long at Maraucourt,\" said Mlle.\r\nBelhomme, \"you must know that M. Vulfran's illness and the continued\r\nabsence of his son is a cause of anxiety to all this part of the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have heard that,\" answered Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"What would become of all those employed in the works, seven thousand,\r\nand all those who are dependent on these seven thousand if Monsieur\r\nVulfran should die and his son not return? Will he leave his fortune and\r\nworks to his nephews, of which he has no more confidence in one than the\r\nother, or to one who for twenty years has been his right hand and who,\r\nhaving managed the works with him is, perhaps more than anyone else, in\r\na position to keep his hold on them?\r\n\r\n\"When M. Vulfran took his nephew Theodore into the business everyone\r\nthought that he intended to make him his heir. But later, when Monsieur\r\nCasimir left college and his uncle sent for him, they saw that they had\r\nmade a mistake and that M. Vulfran had not decided to leave his business\r\nto these two boys. His only wish was to have his son back for, although\r\nthey had been parted for ten years, he still loved him. Now no one knew\r\nwhether the son was dead or alive. But there were those who wished that\r\nhe was dead so that they themselves could take M. Vulfran's place when\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear child,\" said the governess, \"you understand you live here\r\nin the home of M. Vulfran and you must be very discreet in this matter\r\nand not talk about it to Casimir's mother. She is working all she can\r\nfor her son's interest and she will push anyone aside who stands in his\r\nway. Now, if you were on too good terms with her you would be on bad\r\nterms with Theodore's mother, and the other way about. Then, on the\r\nother hand, should you gain the good graces of both of them you would\r\nperhaps have reason to fear one from another direction. That is why I\r\ngive you this little advice. Talk as little as possible. And if you are\r\nquestioned, be careful to make replies as vague as possible. It is\r\nbetter sometimes to be looked upon rather as too stupid than too\r\nintelligent. This is so in your case ... the less intelligent you appear,\r\nthe more intelligent you will really be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nMEDDLING RELATIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advice, given with every kindness, did not tend to lessen Perrine's\r\nanxiety. She was dreading Madame Bretoneux's visit on the morrow.\r\n\r\nHer governess had not exaggerated the situation. The two mothers were\r\nstruggling and scheming in every possible way, each to have her son\r\nalone inherit one day or another the great works of Maraucourt and the\r\nfortune which it was rumored would be more than a hundred million\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nThe one, Mme. Stanislaus Paindavoine, was the wife of M. Vulfran's\r\neldest brother, a big linen merchant. Her husband had not been able to\r\ngive her the position in society which she believed to be hers, and now\r\nshe hoped that, through her son inheriting his uncle's great fortune,\r\nshe would at last be able to take the place in the Parisian world which\r\nshe knew she could grace.\r\n\r\nThe other, Madame Bretoneux was M. Vulfran's married sister who had\r\nmarried a Boulogne merchant, who in turn had been a cement and coal\r\nmerchant, insurance agent and maritime agent, but with all his trades\r\nhad never acquired riches. She wanted her brother's wealth as much for\r\nlove of the money as to get it away from her sister-in-law, whom she\r\nhated.\r\n\r\nWhile their brother and his only son had lived on good terms, they had\r\nhad to content themselves with borrowing all they could from him in\r\nloans which they never intended to pay back; but the day when Edmond had\r\nbeen packed off to India, ostensibly to buy jute but in reality as a\r\npunishment for being too extravagant and getting into debt, the two\r\nwomen had schemed to take advantage of the situation. On each side they\r\nhad made every preparation so that each could have her son alone, at any\r\nmoment, take the place of the exile.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all their endeavors the uncle had never consented to let the\r\nboys live with him at the chateau. There was room enough for them all\r\nand he was sad and lonely, but he had made a firm stand against having\r\nthem with him in his home.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want any quarrels or jealousy around me,\" he had always replied\r\nto the suggestions made.\r\n\r\nHe had then given Theodore the house he had lived in before he built the\r\nchateau and another to Casimir that had belonged to the late head of the\r\ncounting house whom Mombleux had replaced.\r\n\r\nSo their surprise and indignation had been intense when a stranger, a\r\npoor girl, almost a child, had been installed in the chateau where they\r\nthemselves had only been admitted as guests.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean?\r\n\r\nWho was this little girl?\r\n\r\nWhat had they to fear from her?\r\n\r\nMadame Bretoneux had put these questions to her son but his replies had\r\nnot satisfied her. She decided to find out for herself, hence her visit.\r\n\r\nVery uneasy when she arrived, it was not long before she felt quite at\r\nease again so well did Perrine play the part that mademoiselle had\r\nadvised her.\r\n\r\nAlthough M. Vulfran had no wish to have his nephews living with him he\r\nwas very hospitable and cordial to their parents when they came to visit\r\nhim. On these occasions the beautiful mansion put on its most festive\r\nappearance; fires were lighted everywhere; the servants put on their\r\nbest liveries; the best carriages and horses were brought from the\r\nstables, and in the evening the villagers could see the great chateau\r\nlighted up from ground floor to roof.\r\n\r\nThe victoria, with the coachman and footman, had met Mme. Bretoneux at\r\nthe railway station. Upon her getting out of the carriage Bastien had\r\nbeen on hand to show her to the apartment which was also reserved for\r\nher on the first floor.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran never made any change in his habits when his relations came\r\nto Maraucourt. He saw them at meal times, spent the evenings with them,\r\nbut no more of his time did he give them. With him business came before\r\neverything; his nephew, the son of whichever one happened to be visiting\r\nthere, came to luncheon and dinner and remained the evening as late as\r\nhe wished, but that was all.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran spent his hours at the office just the same and Perrine was\r\nalways with him, so Madame Bretoneux was not able to follow up her\r\ninvestigations on the \"little tramp\" as she had wished.\r\n\r\nShe had questioned Bastien and the maids; she had made a call on Mother\r\nFrançoise and had questioned her carefully, also Aunt Zenobie and\r\nRosalie, and she had obtained all the information that they could give\r\nher; that is, all they knew from the moment of her arrival in the\r\nvillage until she went to live in the great house as a companion to the\r\nmillionaire. All this, it seemed, was due exclusively to her knowledge\r\nof English.\r\n\r\nShe found it a difficult matter, however, to talk to Perrine alone, who\r\nnever left M. Vulfran's side unless it was to go to her own room. Madame\r\nBretoneux was in a fever of anxiety to see what was in the girl and\r\ndiscover some reason for her sudden success.\r\n\r\nAt table Perrine said absolutely nothing. In the morning she went off\r\nwith M. Vulfran; after she had finished luncheon she went at once to her\r\nown room. When they returned from the tour of the factories she went at\r\nonce to her lessons with her governess; in the evening, upon leaving the\r\ntable, she went up again to her own room. Madame Bretoneux could not get\r\nthe girl alone to talk with her. Finally, on the eve of her departure,\r\nshe decided to go to Perrine's own room. Perrine, who thought that she\r\nhad got rid of her, was sleeping peacefully.\r\n\r\nA few knocks on the door awoke her. She sat up in bed and listened.\r\nAnother knock.\r\n\r\nShe got up and went to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" she asked, without opening it.\r\n\r\n\"Open the door, it is I ... Madame Bretoneux,\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nPerrine turned the lock. Madame Bretoneux slipped into the room while\r\nPerrine turned on the light.\r\n\r\n\"Get into bed again,\" said Madame Bretoneux, \"we can talk just as well.\"\r\n\r\nShe took a chair and sat at the foot of the bed so that she was full\r\nface with Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"I want to talk with you about my brother,\" she began. \"You have taken\r\nWilliam's place and I want to tell you a few things that you should do;\r\nfor William, in spite of his faults, was very careful of his master's\r\nhealth. You seem a nice little girl and very willing, and I am sure if\r\nyou wish you could do as much as William. I assure you that we shall\r\nappreciate it.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first words Perrine was reassured; if it was only of M. Vulfran's\r\nhealth that she wanted to speak she had nothing to fear.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are a very intelligent girl,\" said Mme. Bretoneux with a\r\nflattering, ingratiating smile.\r\n\r\nAt these words and the look which accompanied them Perrine's suspicions\r\nwere aroused at once.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said, exaggerating her simple child-like smile, \"all I\r\nask is to give as good service as William.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I was sure we could count on you,\" said Mme. Bretoneux.\r\n\r\n\"You have only to say what you wish, Madame,\" said little Perrine,\r\nlooking up at the intruder with her big innocent eyes.\r\n\r\n\"First of all you must be very attentive about his health; you must\r\nwatch him carefully and see that he does not take cold. A cold might be\r\nfateful; he would have pulmonary congestion and that would aggravate his\r\nbronchitis. Do you know if they could cure him of his bronchial trouble\r\nthey could operate upon him and give him back his sight? Think what\r\nhappiness that would be for all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I also would be happy,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Those words prove that you are grateful for what he has done for you,\r\nbut, then, you are not of the family.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine assumed her most innocent air.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but that does not prevent me from being attached to M. Vulfran,\"\r\nshe said, \"believe me, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" answered Mme. Bretoneux, \"and you can prove your devotion\r\nby giving him the care which I am telling you to give him. My brother\r\nmust not only be protected from catching cold, but he must be guarded\r\nagainst sudden emotions which might, in his state of health, kill him.\r\nHe is trying to find our dear Edmond, his only son. He is making\r\ninquiries in India....\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, but Perrine made no reply.\r\n\r\n\"I am told,\" she went on, \"that my brother gets you to translate the\r\nletters and cables that he receives from India. Well, it is most\r\nimportant that if there be bad news that my son should be informed\r\nfirst. Then he will send me a telegram, and as it is not far from here\r\nto Boulogne I will come at once to comfort my poor brother. The sympathy\r\nof a sister is deeper than that of a sister-in-law, you understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Madame, I understand; at least I think so,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Then we can count on you?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine hesitated for a moment, but as she was forced to give a reply\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall do all that I can for M. Vulfran.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and what you do for him will be for us,\" continued Mme. Bretoneux,\r\n\"the same as what you do for us will be for him. And I am going to show\r\nyou that I am not ungrateful. What would you say if I gave you a very\r\nnice dress?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine did not want to say anything, but as she had to make some reply\r\nto the question she put it into a smile.\r\n\r\n\"A very beautiful dress to wear in the evening,\" said Mme. Bretoneux.\r\n\r\n\"But I am in mourning,\" answered Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"But being in black does not prevent you from wearing a lovely dress.\r\nYou are not dressed well enough to dine at my brother's table. You are\r\nvery badly dressed--dressed up like a clever little dog.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine replied that she knew she was not well dressed but she was\r\nsomewhat humiliated to be compared with a clever little dog, and the\r\nway the comparison was made was an evident intention to lower her.\r\n\r\n\"I took what I could find at Mme. Lachaise's shop,\" she said in\r\nself-defense.\r\n\r\n\"It was all right for Mme. Lachaise to dress you when you were a little\r\nfactory girl, but now, that it pleases my brother to have you sit at the\r\ntable with him, we do not wish to blush for you. You must not mind us\r\nmaking fun of you, but you have no idea how you amused us in that\r\ndreadful waist you have been wearing....\"\r\n\r\nMme. Bretoneux smiled as though she could still see Perrine in the\r\nhideous waist.\r\n\r\n\"But there,\" she said brightly, \"all that can be remedied; you are a\r\nbeautiful girl, there is no denying that, and I shall see that you have\r\na dinner dress to set off your beauty and a smart little tailored\r\ncostume to wear in the carriage, and when you see yourself in it you\r\nwill remember who gave it you. I expect your underwear is no better than\r\nyour waist. Let me see it....\"\r\n\r\nThereupon, with an air of authority, she opened first one drawer, then\r\nanother, then shut them again disdainfully with a shrug of her\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" she said, \"it is dreadful; not good enough for you.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine felt suffocated; she could not speak.\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky,\" continued Mme. Bretoneux, \"that I came here, for I intend\r\nto look after you.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine wanted to refuse everything and tell this woman that she did\r\nnot wish her to take care of her, but remembered the part she had to\r\nplay. After all, Mme. Bretoneux's intentions were most generous; it was\r\nher words, her manner, that seemed so hard.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell my brother,\" she continued, \"that he must order from a\r\ndressmaker at Amiens, whose address I will give him, the dinner dress\r\nand the tailor suit which is absolutely necessary, and in addition some\r\ngood underwear. In fact, a whole outfit. Trust in me and you shall have\r\nsome pretty things, and I hope that they'll remind you of me all the\r\ntime. Now don't forget what I have told you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPAINFUL ARGUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the talk his mother had had with Perrine, Casimir, by his looks\r\nand manner, gave her every opportunity to confide in him. But she had no\r\nintention of telling him about the researches that his uncle was having\r\nmade both in India and in England. True, they had no positive news of\r\nthe exile; it was all vague and contradictory, but the blind man still\r\nhoped on. He left no stone unturned to find his beloved son.\r\n\r\nMme. Bretoneux's advice had some good effect. Until then Perrine had not\r\ntaken the liberty of having the hood of the phaeton pulled up, if she\r\nthought the day was chilly, nor had she dared advise M. Vulfran to put\r\non an overcoat nor suggest that he have a scarf around his neck; neither\r\ndid she dare close the window in the study if the evening was too cool,\r\nbut from the moment that Mme. Bretoneux had warned her that the damp\r\nmists and rain would be bad for him she put aside all timidity.\r\n\r\nNow, no matter what the weather was like, she never got into the\r\ncarriage without looking to see that his overcoat was in its place and a\r\nsilk scarf in the pocket; if a slight breeze came up she put the scarf\r\naround his neck or helped him into his coat. If a drop of rain began to\r\nfall she stopped at once and put up the hood. When she first walked out\r\nwith him, she had gone her usual pace and he had followed without a word\r\nof complaint. But now that she realized that a brisk walk hurt him and\r\nusually made him cough or breathe with difficulty, she walked slowly; in\r\nevery way she devised means of going about their usual day's routine so\r\nthat he should feel the least fatigue possible.\r\n\r\nDay by day the blind man's affection for little Perrine grew. He was\r\nnever effusive, but one day while she was carefully attending to his\r\nwants he told her that she was like a little daughter to him. She was\r\ntouched. She took his hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"you are a good girl.\" Putting his hand on her head, he\r\nadded: \"Even when my son returns you shall not leave us; he will be\r\ngrateful to you for what you are to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so little, and I want to be so much,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell him what you have been,\" said the blind man, \"and besides\r\nhe will see for himself; for my son has a good kind heart.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS LIKE A LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIM.]\r\n\r\nOften he would speak in these terms, and Perrine always wanted to ask\r\nhim how, if these were his sentiments, he could have been so unforgiving\r\nand severe with him, but every time she tried to speak the words would\r\nnot come, for her throat was closed with emotion. It was a serious\r\nmatter for her to broach such a subject, but on that particular evening\r\nshe felt encouraged by what had happened. There could not have been a\r\nmore opportune moment; she was alone with him in his study where no one\r\ncame unless summoned. She was seated near him under the lamplight. Ought\r\nshe to hesitate longer?\r\n\r\nShe thought not.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind,\" she said, in a little trembling voice, \"if I ask you\r\nsomething that I do not understand? I think of it all the time, and yet\r\nI have been afraid to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak out,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What I cannot understand,\" she said timidly, \"is that loving your son\r\nas you do, you could be parted from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is because you are so young you do not understand,\" he said, \"that\r\nthere is duty as well as love. As a father, it was my duty to send him\r\naway; that was to teach him a lesson. I had to show him that my will was\r\nstronger than his. That is why I sent him to India where I intended to\r\nkeep him but a short while. I gave him a position befitting my son and\r\nheir. He was the representative of my house. Did I know that he would\r\nmarry that miserable creature? He was mad!\"\r\n\r\n\"But Father Fields said that she was not a miserable creature,\" insisted\r\nPerrine.\r\n\r\n\"She was or she would not have contracted a marriage that was not valid\r\nin France,\" retorted the blind man, \"and I will not recognize her as my\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this in a tone that made Perrine feel suddenly cold. Then he\r\ncontinued abruptly: \"You wonder why I am trying to get my son back now,\r\nif I did not want him back after he had married. Things have changed.\r\nConditions are not the same now as then. After fourteen years of this\r\nso-called marriage my son ought to be tired of this woman and of the\r\nmiserable life that he has been forced to live on account of her.\r\nBesides conditions for me have also changed. My health is not what it\r\nwas, and I am blind. I cannot recover my sight unless I am operated upon\r\nand I must be in a calm state favorable to the success of this\r\noperation. When my son learns this do you think he will hesitate to\r\nleave this woman? I am willing to support her and her daughter also. I\r\nam sure many times he has thought of Maraucourt and wanted to return. If\r\nI love him I know that he also loves me. When he learns the truth he\r\nwill come back at once, you will see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he would have to leave his wife and daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no wife nor has he a daughter,\" said the old man sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Father Fields says that he was married at the Mission House by Father\r\nLeclerc,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"This marriage was contracted contrary to the French law,\" said M.\r\nVulfran.\r\n\r\n\"But was it not lawful in India?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"I will have it annulled in Rome,\" said the blind man.\r\n\r\n\"But the daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"The law would not recognize that child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the law everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that it is not the law that makes one love or not love one's\r\nparents or children. It was not the law that made me love my poor\r\nfather. I loved him because he was good and kind and he loved me. I was\r\nhappy when he kissed me, and smiled at me. I loved him and there was\r\nnothing that I liked better than to be with him. He loved me because I\r\nwas his little girl and needed his affection; he loved me because he\r\nknew that I loved him with all my heart. The law had nothing to do with\r\nthat. I did not ask if it was the law that made him my father. It was\r\nour love that made us so much to each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you driving at?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon if I have said anything I should not say, but I speak\r\nas I think and as I feel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is why I am listening to you,\" said the blind man; \"what you\r\nsay is not quite reasonable, but you speak as a good girl would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, what I am trying to say is this,\" said Perrine boldly; \"if\r\nyou love your son and want to have him back with you, he also loves his\r\ndaughter and wants to have her with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He should not hesitate between his father and his daughter,\" said the\r\nold man; \"besides, if the marriage is annulled, she will be nothing to\r\nhim. He could soon marry that woman off again with the dowry that I\r\nwould give her. Everything is changed since he went away. My fortune is\r\nmuch larger.... He will have riches, honor and position. Surely it isn't\r\na little half-caste that can keep him back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she is not so dreadful as you imagine,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"A Hindu.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the books that I read to you it says that the Hindus are more\r\nbeautiful than the Europeans,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Travelers' exaggerations,\" said the old man scoffingly.\r\n\r\n\"They have graceful figures, faces of pure oval, deep eyes with a proud\r\nlook. They are patient, courageous, industrious; they are studious....\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a memory!\"\r\n\r\n\"One should always remember what one reads, should not one?\" asked\r\nPerrine. \"It does not seem that the Hindu is such a horrible creature as\r\nyou say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what does all that matter to me as I do not know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you knew her you might perhaps get interested in her and learn\r\nto love her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! I can't bear to think of her and her mother!...\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you knew her you might not feel so angry towards her.\"\r\n\r\nHe clenched his fist as though unable to control his fury, but he did\r\nnot stop her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose that she is at all like you suppose,\" said Perrine;\r\n\"Father Fields is a good priest and he would not say what was not true,\r\nand he says that her mother was good and kind and a lady....\"\r\n\r\n\"He never knew her; it is hearsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it seems that everyone holds this opinion. If she came to your\r\nhouse would you not be as kind to her as you have been to me, ... a\r\nstranger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say anything against yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not speak for or against myself, but what I ask is for justice. I\r\nknow if that daughter, your granddaughter, came here she would love you\r\nwith all her heart.\"\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands together and looked up at him as though he could\r\nsee her; her voice shook with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you like to be loved by your granddaughter?\" she asked\r\npleadingly.\r\n\r\nThe blind man rose impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you she can never be anything to me,\" he cried. \"I hate her as I\r\nhate her mother. The woman took my son from me and she keeps him from\r\nme. If she had not bewitched him he would have been back long before\r\nthis. She has been everything to him while I, his father, have been\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe strode back and forth, carried away with his anger. She had never\r\nseen him like this. Suddenly he stopped before her.\r\n\r\n\"Go to your room,\" he said almost harshly, \"and never speak of those\r\ncreatures to me again; besides, what right have you to mix up in this?\r\nWho told you to speak to me in such a manner?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she was dumbfounded, then she said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no one, sir, I assure you. I just put myself into your little\r\ngranddaughter's place, that is all.\"\r\n\r\nHe softened somewhat, but he continued still in a severe voice: \"In the\r\nfuture do not speak on this subject; you see it is painful for me and\r\nyou must not annoy me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said, her voice full of tears; \"certainly I\r\nought not to have spoken so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BLIND MAN'S GRIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur Vulfran advertised in the principal newspapers of Calcutta,\r\nDacca, Bombay and London for his son. He offered a reward of forty\r\npounds to anyone who could furnish any information, however slight it\r\nmight be, about Edmond Paindavoine. The information must, however, be\r\nauthentic. Not wishing to give his own address, which might have brought\r\nto him all sorts of correspondence more or less dishonest, he put the\r\nmatter into the hands of his banker at Amiens.\r\n\r\nNumerous letters were received, but very few were serious; the greater\r\nnumber came from detectives who guaranteed to find the person they were\r\nsearching for if the expenses for the first steps necessary could be\r\nsent them. Other letters promised everything without any foundation\r\nwhatever upon which they based their promises. Others related events\r\nthat had occurred five, ten, twelve years previous; no one kept to the\r\ntime stated in the advertisement, that was the last three years.\r\n\r\nPerrine read or translated all these letters for the blind man. He would\r\nnot be discouraged at the meagre indications sent him.\r\n\r\n\"It is only by continued advertising that we shall get results,\" he\r\nsaid always. Then again he advertised.\r\n\r\nFinally, one day a letter from Bosnia gave them some information which\r\nmight lead to something. It was written in bad English, and stated that\r\nif the advertiser would place the forty pounds promised with a banker at\r\nSerajevo the writer would furnish authentic information concerning M.\r\nEdmond Paindavoine going back to the month of November of the preceding\r\nyear. If this proposition was acceptable, the reply was to be sent to N.\r\n917, General Delivery, Serajevo.\r\n\r\nThis letter seemed to give M. Vulfran so much relief and joy that it was\r\na confession of what his fears had been.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since he had commenced his investigations, he spoke\r\nof his son to his two nephews and Talouel.\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to tell you that at last I have news of my son,\" he\r\nsaid. \"He was in Bosnia last November.\"\r\n\r\nThere was great excitement as the news was spread through the various\r\ntowns and villages. As usual under such circumstances, it was\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n\"M. Edmond is coming back. He'll be home shortly,\" went from one to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"It's not possible!\" cried some.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't believe it,\" they were told, \"you've only to look at\r\nTalouel's face and M. Vulfran's nephews.\"\r\n\r\nYet there were some who would not believe that the exile would return.\r\nThe old man had been too hard on him. He had not deserved to be sent\r\naway to India because he had made a few debts. His own family had cast\r\nhim aside, so he had a little family of his own out in India. Why should\r\nhe come back? And then, even if he was in Bosnia or Turkey, that was not\r\nto say that he was on his way to Maraucourt. Coming from India to\r\nFrance, why should he have to go to Bosnia? It was not on the route.\r\n\r\nThis remark came from Bendit, who, with his English coolheadedness,\r\nlooked at things only from a practical standpoint, in which sentiment\r\nplayed no part. He thought that just because everyone wished for the son\r\nand heir to return, it was not enough to bring him back. The French\r\ncould wish a thing and believe it, but he was English, he was, and he\r\nwould not believe that he was coming back until he saw him there with\r\nhis own eyes!\r\n\r\nDay by day the blind man grew more impatient to see his son. Perrine\r\ncould not bear to hear him talk of his return as a certainty. Many times\r\nshe tried to tell him that he might be disappointed. One day, when she\r\ncould bear it no longer, she begged him in her sweet voice not to count\r\ntoo much upon seeing his son for fear something might still keep him\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe blind man asked her what she meant.\r\n\r\n\"It is so terrible to hear the worst when one has been expecting the\r\nbest,\" she said brokenly. \"If I say this it is because that is just what\r\nhappened to me. We had thought and hoped so much when my father was ill\r\nthat he would get better, but we lost him, and poor mama and I did not\r\nknow how to bear it. We would not think that he might die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but my boy is alive, and he will be here soon. He will come back to\r\nme very soon,\" said the old man in a firm voice.\r\n\r\nThe next day the banker from Amiens called at the factory. He was met at\r\nthe steps by Talouel, who did all in his power to get the first\r\ninformation which he knew the banker was bringing. At first his attitude\r\nwas very obsequious, but when he saw that his advances were repulsed,\r\nand that the visitor insisted upon seeing his employer at once, he\r\npointed rudely in the direction of M. Vulfran's office and said:\r\n\r\n\"You will find him over there in that room,\" and then turned and went\r\noff with his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\nThe banker knocked on the door indicated.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" called out M. Vulfran, in answer to his knock.\r\n\r\n\"What, you ... you at Maraucourt!\" he exclaimed when he saw his visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I had some business to attend to at Picquigny, and I came on here\r\nto bring you some news received from Bosnia.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine sat at her little table. She had gone very white; she seemed\r\nlike one struck dumb.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"It is not what you hoped, what we all hoped,\" said the banker quietly.\r\n\r\n\"You mean that that fellow who wrote just wanted to get hold of the\r\nforty pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; he seems an honest man....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he knows nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"He does, but unfortunately his information is only too true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately!\" gasped the blind man. This was the first word of doubt\r\nthat he had uttered. \"You mean,\" he added, \"that they have no more news\r\nof him since last November?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no news since then. The French Consul at Serajevo, Bosnia, has\r\nsent me this information:\r\n\r\n\"'Last November your son arrived at Serajevo practising the trade of a\r\nstrolling photographer....'\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" exclaimed M. Vulfran. \"A strolling photographer!...\r\nMy son?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had a wagon,\" continued the banker, \"a sort of caravan in which he\r\ntraveled with his wife and child. He used to take pictures on the market\r\nsquares where they stopped....\"\r\n\r\nThe banker paused and glanced at some papers he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you have something to read, haven't you?\" said the blind man as he\r\nheard the paper rustle. \"Read, it will be quicker.\"\r\n\r\n\"He plied the trade of a photographer,\" continued the banker, consulting\r\nhis notes, \"and at the beginning of November he left Serajevo for\r\nTravnik, where he fell ill. He became very ill....\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" cried the blind man. \"Oh, God....\"\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran had clasped his hands; he was trembling from head to foot, as\r\nthough a vision of his son was standing before him.\r\n\r\n\"You must have courage,\" said the banker, gently. \"You need all your\r\ncourage. Your son....\"\r\n\r\n\"He is dead!\" said the blind man.\r\n\r\n\"That is only too true,\" replied the banker. \"All the papers are\r\nauthentic. I did not want to have any doubt upon the matter, and that\r\nwas why I cabled to our Consul at Serajevo. Here is his reply; it leaves\r\nno doubt.\"\r\n\r\nBut the old man did not appear to be listening. He sat huddled up in his\r\nbig chair, his head drooped forward on his chest. He gave no sign of\r\nlife. Perrine, terrified, wondered if he were dead.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he pulled himself together and the tears began to run down\r\nhis wrinkled cheeks. He brushed them aside quickly and touched the\r\nelectric bell which communicated with Talouel's and his nephew's\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nThe call was so imperative that they all ran to the office together.\r\n\r\n\"You are there?\" asked the blind man; \"Talouel, Theodore and Casimir?\"\r\n\r\nAll three replied together.\r\n\r\n\"I have just learned of the death of my son,\" said their employer. \"Stop\r\nwork in all the factories immediately. Tomorrow the funeral services\r\nwill be held in the churches at Maraucourt, Saint-Pipoy and all the\r\nother villages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, uncle!\" cried both the nephews.\r\n\r\nHe stopped them with uplifted hand.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to be alone ... leave me,\" was all he said.\r\n\r\nEveryone left the room but Perrine. She alone remained.\r\n\r\n\"Aurelie, are you there?\" asked the blind man.\r\n\r\nShe replied with a sob.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go home,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAs was his habit, he placed his hand on her shoulder, and it was like\r\nthis that they passed through the crowd of workers who streamed from the\r\nfactory. As they stood aside for him to pass, all who saw him wondered\r\nif he would survive this blow. He, who usually walked so upright, was\r\nbent like a tree that the storm has broken.\r\n\r\nCould he survive this shock? Perrine asked herself this question with\r\neven greater agony, for it was she and she alone who knew how his great\r\nframe was trembling. His shaking hands grasped her shoulder\r\nconvulsively, and without him uttering one word little Perrine knew how\r\ndeeply her grandfather was smitten.\r\n\r\nAfter she had guided him into his study he sent her away.\r\n\r\n\"Explain why I wish to be left alone. No one is to come in here. No one\r\nis to speak to me....\r\n\r\n\"And I refused to believe you,\" he murmured as she was leaving him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please; if you will let me....\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me,\" he said roughly.\r\n\r\nPerrine closed the door softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nAN UNRESPECTED FUNERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was considerable bustle and excitement at the chateau all that\r\nevening. First M. and Mme. Stanislas Paindavoine, who had received a\r\ntelegram from Theodore, arrived. Then M. and Mme. Bretoneux, sent for by\r\nCasimir, came. After that came Mme. Bretoneux's two daughters, their\r\nhusbands and children. No one wished to miss the funeral service for\r\npoor dear Edmond.\r\n\r\nBesides, this was the decisive moment for clever manoeuvring. What a\r\ndisaster if this big industry should fall into the hands of one so\r\nincapable as Theodore! What a misfortune if Casimir took charge! Neither\r\nside thought that a partnership could be possible, and the two cousins\r\nshare alike. Each wanted all for himself.\r\n\r\nBoth Mme. Bretoneux and Mme. Paindavoine had ignored Perrine since their\r\narrival. They had given her to understand that they did not require her\r\nservices any longer.\r\n\r\nShe sat in her room hoping that M. Vulfran would send for her so that\r\nshe could help him into the church, as she had done every Sunday since\r\nWilliam had gone. But she waited in vain. When the bells, which had\r\nbeen tolling since the evening before, announced mass, she saw him get\r\nup into his carriage leaning on his brother's arm, while his sister and\r\nsister-in-law, with the members of their families, took their places in\r\nother carriages.\r\n\r\nShe had no time to lose, for she had to walk. She hurried off.\r\n\r\nAfter she had left the house over which Death had spread its shroud, she\r\nwas surprised to notice as she hastened through the village that the\r\ntaverns had taken on their Sunday air. The men drank and laughed and the\r\nwomen chatted at their doors, while the children played in the street.\r\nPerrine wondered if none of them were going to attend the service.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the church, where she had been afraid that she would not\r\nfind room, she saw that it was almost empty. The bereaved family sat in\r\nthe choir; here and there was some village authority, a tradesman and\r\nthe heads of the factories. Very few of the working men and women were\r\npresent; they had not thought to come and join their prayers to those of\r\ntheir employer.\r\n\r\nPerrine took a seat beside Rosalie and her grandmother, who was in deep\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my poor little Edmond,\" murmured the old nurse, wiping her eyes.\r\n\"What did M. Vulfran say?\"\r\n\r\nBut Perrine was too overcome to reply. The services commenced.\r\n\r\nAs she left the church, Mlle. Belhomme came up to her, and, like\r\nFrançoise, wanted to question her about M. Vulfran. Perrine told her\r\nthat he had not spoken to her since the evening before.\r\n\r\n\"As I saw him kneeling there so crushed and broken for the first time, I\r\nwas pleased that he was blind,\" said the governess sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Because he could not see how few people came to the church. What\r\nindifference his men have shown! If he could have seen that empty church\r\nit would have added to his grief.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he must have known how few there were there,\" said Perrine.\r\n\"His ears take the place of his eyes, and that empty silence could not\r\ndeceive him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor man,\" murmured Mlle. Belhomme; \"and yet....\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. Then, as she was not in the habit of holding anything back,\r\nshe went on: \"And yet it will be a great lesson to him. You know, my\r\nchild, you cannot expect others to share your sorrows if you are not\r\nwilling to share theirs.\r\n\r\n\"M. Vulfran gives his men what he considers their due,\" she continued,\r\nin a lower voice. \"He is just, but that is all. He has never been a\r\nfather to his men. He is all for business, business only. What a lot of\r\ngood he could have done, however, not only here, but everywhere, if he\r\nhad wished, by setting an example. Had he been more to his men you may\r\nbe sure that the church would not have been as empty as it was today.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was true, but how it hurt Perrine to hear this from the\r\nlips of her governess, of whom she was so fond. If anyone else had said\r\nso she might not have felt it so deeply. Yes, undoubtedly it was too\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThey had been walking as they talked, and had now reached the schools\r\nwhere Mlle. Belhomme lived.\r\n\r\n\"Come in and we'll have luncheon together,\" she said. She was thinking\r\nthat her pupil would not be allowed to take her accustomed place at the\r\nfamily table.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" said Perrine; \"but M. Vulfran might need me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in that case you had better go back,\" said Mlle. Belhomme.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the chateau she saw that M. Vulfran had no need of her,\r\nthat he was not even thinking of her. Bastien, whom she met on the\r\nstairs, told her that when he came back from the church he had gone to\r\nhis own room and locked himself in, forbidding anyone to enter.\r\n\r\n\"He won't even sit down on a day like this with his family,\" said\r\nBastien, \"and they are all going after luncheon. I don't think he even\r\nwants to say goodbye to them. Lord help us! What will become of us? Oh,\r\npoor master!\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"You can do a great deal. The master believes in you, and he's mighty\r\nfond of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty fond of me?\" echoed Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and it's I as says it,\" said the butler. \"He likes you a whole\r\nlot.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bastien had said, all the family left after luncheon. Perrine stayed\r\nin her room, but M. Vulfran did not send for her. Just before she went\r\nto bed, Bastien came to tell her that his master wished her to accompany\r\nhim the next morning at the usual hour.\r\n\r\n\"He wants to get back to work, but will he be able?\" said the old\r\nbutler. \"It will be better for him if he can. Work means life for him.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day at the usual hour Perrine was waiting for M. Vulfran. With\r\nbent back he came forward, guided by Bastien. The butler made a sign to\r\nher that his master had passed a bad night.\r\n\r\n\"Is Aurelie there?\" asked the blind man in a changed voice, a voice low\r\nand weak, like that of a sick child.\r\n\r\nPerrine went forward quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I am here, M. Vulfran,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Let us get into the carriage, Aurelie,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had taken his place beside Perrine his head drooped on his\r\nchest. He said not a word.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the office steps Talouel was there ready to receive him\r\nand help him to alight.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you felt strong enough to come?\" he said, in a sympathetic\r\nvoice which contrasted with the flash in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I did not feel at all strong, but I came because I thought that I ought\r\nto come,\" said his employer.\r\n\r\n\"That is what I meant ... I....\"\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran stopped him and told Perrine to guide him to his office.\r\n\r\nThe mail, which had accumulated in two days, was read, but the blind man\r\nmade no comments on the correspondence. It was as though he were deaf or\r\nasleep. The heads of the factory then came in to discuss an important\r\nquestion that had to be settled that day. When the immediate business\r\nwas settled Perrine was left alone with the blind man. He was silent.\r\n\r\nTime passed; he did not move. She had often seen him sit still, but on\r\nsuch occasions, from the expression on his face, she had known that he\r\nwas following his work as though he were watching with his eyes. He\r\nlistened to the whistle of the engines, the rolling of the trucks; he\r\nwas attentive to every sound and seemed to know exactly what was going\r\non, but now he seemed as though he were turned into a statue. There was\r\nno expression in his face and he was so silent. He did not seem to be\r\nbreathing. Perrine was overcome by a sort of terror. She moved uneasily\r\nin her chair; she did not dare speak to him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he put his two hands over his face and, as though unaware that\r\nanyone was present, he cried: \"My God! my God! you have forsaken me! Oh,\r\nLord, what have I done that you should forsake me!\"\r\n\r\nThen the heavy silence fell again. Perrine trembled when she heard his\r\ncry, although she could not grasp the depth of his despair.\r\n\r\nEverything that this man had attempted had been a success; he had\r\ntriumphed over his rivals; but now, with one blow, that which he wanted\r\nmost had been snatched from him. He had been waiting for his son; their\r\nmeeting, after so many years of absence, he had pictured to himself, and\r\nthen....\r\n\r\nThen what?\r\n\r\n\"My God,\" cried the blind man again, \"why have you taken him from me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE ANGEL OF REFORM\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the days passed M. Vulfran became very weak. At last he was confined\r\nto his room with a serious attack of bronchitis, and the entire\r\nmanagement of the works was given over to Talouel, who was triumphant.\r\n\r\nWhen he recovered he was in such a state of apathy that it was alarming.\r\nThey could not rouse him; nothing seemed to interest him, not even his\r\nbusiness. Previously they had feared the effect a shock would have on\r\nhis system, but now the doctors desired it, for it seemed that only a\r\ngreat shock could drag him out of this terrible condition. What could\r\nthey do?\r\n\r\nAfter a time he returned to his business, but he scarcely took account\r\nof what Talouel had done during his absence. His manager, however, had\r\nbeen too clever and shrewd to take any steps that his employer would not\r\nhave taken himself.\r\n\r\nEvery day Perrine took him to his various factories, but the drives were\r\nmade in silence now. Frequently he did not reply to the remarks she made\r\nfrom time to time, and when he reached the works he scarcely listened to\r\nwhat his men had to say.\r\n\r\n\"Do what you think best,\" he said always. \"Arrange the matter with\r\nTalouel.\"\r\n\r\nHow long would this apathy last?\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when old Coco was bringing them back to Maraucourt, they\r\nheard a bell ringing.\r\n\r\n\"Stop,\" he said; \"I think that's the fire alarm.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine stopped the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's a fire,\" he said, listening. \"Do you see anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see a lot of black smoke over by the poplars on the left,\"\r\nreplied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"On the left? That is the way to the factory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; shall I drive that way?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied M. Vulfran, indifferently.\r\n\r\nIt was not until they reached the village that they knew where the fire\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\"Don't hurry, M. Vulfran,\" called out a peasant; \"the fire ain't in your\r\nhouse. It's La Tiburce's house that's on fire.\"\r\n\r\nLa Tiburce was a drunken creature who minded little babies who were too\r\nyoung to be taken to the crèche. She lived in a miserable tumble-down\r\nhouse near the schools.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go there,\" said M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\nThey had only to follow the crowd, for the people, when they saw the\r\nflames and smoke rising, were running excitedly to the spot where the\r\nfire was. Before reaching the scene Perrine had to stop several times\r\nfor fear of running someone down. Nothing in the world would have made\r\nthe people get out of their way. Finally M. Vulfran got out of the\r\ncarriage and, guided by Perrine, walked through the crowd. As they\r\nneared the entrance to the house, Fabry, wearing a helmet, for he was\r\nchief of the firemen, came up to them.\r\n\r\n\"We've got it under control,\" he said, \"but the house is entirely burnt,\r\nand what's worse, several children, five or six, perhaps, are lost. One\r\nis buried beneath, two have been suffocated, and we don't know where the\r\nother three are.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"La Tiburce was asleep, drunk. She is still in that condition. The\r\nbiggest of the children were playing with the matches. When the fire\r\nbegan to flare up some of the children got out, and La Tiburce woke up.\r\nShe is so drunk she got out herself but left the little ones in the\r\ncradle.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of cries and loud talking could be heard in the yard. M.\r\nVulfran wanted to go in.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go in there, sir,\" said Fabry. \"The mothers whose two children\r\nwere suffocated are carrying on pretty badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two women who work in your factory.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must speak to them.\"\r\n\r\nLeaning on Perrine's shoulder, he told her to guide him. Preceded by\r\nFabry, who made way for them, they went into the yard where the firemen\r\nwere turning the hose on the house as the flames burst forth in a\r\ncrackling sound.\r\n\r\nIn a far-off corner several women stood round the two mothers who were\r\ncrying. Fabry brushed aside the group. M. Vulfran went up to the\r\nbereaved parents, who sat with their dead children on their knees. Then\r\none of the women, who thought perhaps that a supreme help had come,\r\nlooked up with a gleam of hope in her eyes. When she recognized M.\r\nVulfran she raised her arm to him threateningly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" she cried, \"come and see for yourself what they do to our babies\r\nwhile we are sweating and killing ourselves for you. Can you give us\r\nback their lives? Oh, my little boy.\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into sobs as she bent over her child.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran hesitated for a moment; then he turned to Fabry and said:\r\n\r\n\"You are right; let us go.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the offices. After a time Talouel came to tell his\r\nemployer that out of the six children that they had thought were dead,\r\nthree had been found in the homes of neighbors, where they had been\r\ncarried when the fire first broke out. The burial for the other three\r\ntiny victims was to take place the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen Talouel had gone, Perrine, who had been very thoughtful, decided to\r\nspeak to M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not going to the burial service of these little babies?\" she\r\nasked. Her trembling voice betrayed her emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I go?\" asked M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Because that would be the most dignified answer you could give to what\r\nthat poor woman said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did my work people come to the burial service of my son?\" asked M.\r\nVulfran, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"They did not share your sorrow,\" said Perrine gravely, \"but if you\r\nshare theirs now they will be touched.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know how ungrateful the workingman is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ungrateful! For what? The money they receive? They consider that they\r\nhave a right to the money they earn. It is theirs. Would they show\r\ningratitude if an interest was taken in them, if a little friendly help\r\nwas given them? Perhaps it would not be the same, do you think so?\r\nFriendship creates friendship. One often loves when one knows one is\r\nloved, and it seems to me that when we are friendly to others, we make\r\nfriends ourselves. It means so much to lighten the burdens of the poor,\r\nbut how much more is it to lighten their sorrows ... by helping to share\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that she had still so much to say on this subject, but\r\nM. Vulfran did not reply. He did not even appear to be listening to her,\r\nand she was afraid to say more. Later she might make another attempt.\r\n\r\nAs they left the office M. Vulfran turned to Talouel, who was standing\r\non the steps, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Tell the priest to arrange a suitable burial for the three children. It\r\nwill be at my expense and I shall be there.\"\r\n\r\nTalouel jumped.\r\n\r\n\"And let everyone know,\" continued M. Vulfran, \"that all who wish to go\r\nto the church tomorrow, can take the time off. This fire is a great\r\nmisfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not responsible for it,\" said Talouel.\r\n\r\n\"Not directly ... no,\" said M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\nPerrine had another surprise the next morning. After the mail had been\r\nopened and the replies dictated, M. Vulfran detained Fabry and said: \"I\r\nwant you to start for Rouen. I think you can spare the time. I have\r\nheard that they have built a model crèche there. It is not built by the\r\ntown, but someone has had it built to the memory of one whom they have\r\nlost. I want you to see how this is made. Study it in all its\r\ndetails--the construction, heating and ventilation and the expense of\r\nkeeping it up. In three months we must have a crèche at the entrance of\r\nall my factories. I don't want such a calamity as that which occurred\r\nyesterday to take place again. I rely upon you and the responsibility is\r\nupon you now.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening Perrine told the great news to her governess, who was\r\ndelighted. While they were talking about it, M. Vulfran came into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said, \"I have come to ask a favor of you in the name\r\nof all the village. It is a big favor. It may mean a great sacrifice on\r\nyour part. This is it.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few words he outlined the request he had to make. It was that\r\nmademoiselle should send in her resignation at the schools and take\r\ncharge of the five crèches which he was going to build. He knew of no\r\none who was capable of taking on their shoulders such a big burden. He\r\nwould donate a crèche to each village and endow it with sufficient\r\ncapital to keep up its maintenance.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mlle. Belhomme loved to teach, and it would be indeed a\r\nsacrifice for her to give up her school, she felt, after she had talked\r\nwith the blind man, that it was here where her duty lay. It was indeed a\r\ngreat work that she was called upon to do, and she would enter upon her\r\ntask with all the enthusiasm of which her big heart was capable.\r\n\r\n\"This is a great thing you are doing, Monsieur Vulfran,\" she said, with\r\ntears in her eyes, \"and I will do all I can to make this work a\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is your pupil one must thank for it,\" said the blind man, \"not I.\r\nHer words and suggestions have awakened something in my heart. I have\r\nstepped out on a new road. I am only at the first steps. It is nothing\r\ncompared with what I intend to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please,\" said Perrine, her eyes bright with delight and pride, \"if\r\nyou still want to do something....\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I want to take you somewhere ... tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Where do you want to take me?\" asked the blind man,\r\nmystified.\r\n\r\n\"To a place where your presence only for a few moments will bring about\r\nextraordinary results,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, can't you tell me where this mysterious place is?\" asked M.\r\nVulfran.\r\n\r\n\"But if I tell you, your visit will not have the same effect. It will be\r\na failure. It will be a fine evening and warm, and I am sure that you\r\nwill not take cold. Please say you will go!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think one could have confidence in her,\" said Mademoiselle Belhomme,\r\n\"although her request seems a little strange and childish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said M. Vulfran, indulgently, \"I'll do as you wish, Aurelie. Now\r\nat what hour are we to start on this adventure?\"\r\n\r\n\"The later it is the better it will be,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening he spoke several times of the outing they were to\r\nhave, but Perrine would not explain.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, little girl, you have aroused my curiosity?\" he said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you are interested,\" she said gravely. \"There is so much that\r\ncan be done in the future. Do not look back to the past any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"The future is empty for me,\" said the blind man bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; it is not,\" said Perrine, lifting her lovely face to his. Her\r\neyes were shining with a beautiful light. \"It will not be empty if you\r\nthink of others. When one is a child, and not very happy, one often\r\nthinks that if a wonderful fairy came to them, of what beautiful things\r\nthey would ask. But if one is the fairy, or rather the magician oneself,\r\nand can do all the wonderful things alone, wouldn't it be splendid to\r\nuse one's power?...\"\r\n\r\nThe evening passed. Several times the blind man asked if it were not\r\ntime to start, but Perrine delayed as long as possible.\r\n\r\nAt last she said that she thought they could start. The night was warm,\r\nno breeze, no mists. The atmosphere was a trifle heavy and the sky dark.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the village it was all quiet. All seemed to sleep. Not\r\na light shone from the windows.\r\n\r\nThe dark night made no difference to the blind man. As they walked along\r\nthe road from the chateau he knew exactly where he was.\r\n\r\n\"We must be nearing Françoise's house,\" he said, after they had walked a\r\nlittle distance.\r\n\r\n\"That is just where we are going,\" said Perrine. \"We are there now. Let\r\nme take your hand and guide you, and please don't speak. We have some\r\nstairs to go up, but they are quite easy and straight. When we get to\r\nthe top of these stairs I shall open a door and we shall go into a room\r\nfor just one moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to see ... when I can't see anything?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no need for you to see,\" replied Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Then why come?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you here,\" said Perrine earnestly. \"Here are the stairs. Now\r\nstep up, please.\"\r\n\r\nThey climbed up the stairs and Perrine opened a door and gently drew M.\r\nVulfran inside a room and closed the door again.\r\n\r\nThey stood in a suffocating, evil-smelling room.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" asked a weary voice.\r\n\r\nPressing his hand, Perrine warned M. Vulfran not to speak.\r\n\r\nThe same voice spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Get into bed, La Noyelle. How late you are.\"\r\n\r\nThis time M. Vulfran clasped Perrine's hand in a sign for them to leave\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door and they went down, while a murmur of voices\r\naccompanied them. When they reached the street M. Vulfran spoke: \"You\r\nwanted me to know what that room was the first night when you slept\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted you to know what kind of a place all the women who work for\r\nyou have to sleep in. They are all alike in Maraucourt and the other\r\nvillages. You have stood in one of these dreadful rooms; all the others\r\nare like it. Think of your women and children, your factory hands, who\r\nare breathing that poisoned air. They are slowly dying. They are almost\r\nall weak and sick.\"\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran was silent. He did not speak again, neither did Perrine. When\r\nthey entered the hall he bade her good night, and guided by Bastien, he\r\nwent to his own room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nGRANDFATHER FINDS PERRINE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne year had passed since Perrine had arrived at Maraucourt on that\r\nradiant Sunday morning. What a miserable lonely little girl she had been\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nThe day was just as radiant now, but what a change in Perrine, and, be\r\nit said, in the whole village also. She was now a lovely girl of\r\nfifteen. She knew she was loved and loved for herself, and this is what\r\ngave the deep look of happiness to her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd the village! No one would have recognized it now. There were new\r\nbuildings, pretty cottages, and a hospital commanding a view of the\r\nsurrounding country. Near the factories were two handsome red brick\r\nbuildings. These were the crèches where the little children, whose\r\nmothers were working in the factories, were kept. All the little\r\nchildren had their meals there, and many of them slept there. It was a\r\nhome for them.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran had bought up all the old houses, the tumble-down hovels and\r\nhuts, and had built new cottages in their places. There was a large\r\nrestaurant built where the men and women could get a dinner for eleven\r\ncents, the meal consisting of a soup, stew or roast, bread and cider.\r\n\r\nEvery little cottage, for which the tenant paid one hundred francs a\r\nyear, had its own tiny garden in which to grow vegetables for the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn the road leading to the chateau there was now a fine recreation\r\nground, which was greatly patronized after the factories had closed.\r\nThere were merry-go-rounds, swings, bowling alleys and a stand for the\r\nmusicians who played every Saturday and Sunday, and of course on every\r\nholiday. This public park of amusement was used by the people of all\r\nfive villages. Monsieur Vulfran had thought it better to have one place\r\nof reunion and recreation. If his people all met together to enjoy their\r\nleisure hours, it would establish good relations and a bond of\r\nfriendship between them. At the end of the grounds there was a fine\r\nlibrary with a reading and writing room.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran's relations thought that he had gone mad. Did he intend to\r\nruin himself? That is to say, ruin them? Some steps ought to be taken to\r\nprevent him from spending his fortune in this manner. His fondness for\r\nthat girl was a proof that he was losing his mind. That girl did not\r\nknow what she was doing! All their animosity was centered on her. What\r\ndid it matter to her that his fortune was being thrown away? But if\r\nPerrine had all the relations against her, she knew that she had M.\r\nVulfran's friendship, and the family doctor, Doctor Ruchon, Mlle.\r\nBelhomme and Fabry all adored her. Since the doctor had seen that it\r\nwas the \"little girl\" who had been the means of his patient exerting\r\nthis wonderful moral and intellectual energy, his attitude to her\r\nexpressed the greatest respect and affection. In the doctor's eyes,\r\nPerrine was a wonderful little girl.\r\n\r\n\"She can do a great deal more than I can,\" he said, shaking his gray\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAnd Mlle. Belhomme, how proud she was of her pupil! As to Fabry, he was\r\non the best of terms with her. He had been so closely connected with her\r\nin the good work that had been done, for Fabry had superintended\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past twelve. Fabry had not yet arrived. M. Vulfran, usually\r\nso calm, was getting impatient. Luncheon was over and he had gone into\r\nhis study with Perrine; every now and again he walked to the window and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\"The train must be late,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nPerrine wanted to keep him away from the window, for there were many\r\nthings going on outside in the park about which she did not wish him to\r\nknow. With unusual activity, the gardeners were putting great pots of\r\nflowers on the steps and in front of the house. Flags were flying from\r\nthe recreation grounds, which could be seen from the windows.\r\n\r\nAt last the wheels of a carriage were heard on the drive.\r\n\r\n\"There's Fabry,\" said M. Vulfran. His voice expressed anxiety, but\r\npleasure at the same time.\r\n\r\nFabry came in quickly. He also appeared to be in a somewhat excited\r\nstate. He gave a look at Perrine which made her feel uneasy without\r\nknowing why.\r\n\r\n\"I got your telegram,\" said M. Vulfran, \"but it was so vague. I want to\r\nbe sure. Speak out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I speak before mademoiselle?\" asked Fabry, glancing at Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if it is as you say.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Fabry had asked if he could speak before\r\nPerrine. In the state of mind in which she was suddenly thrown, this\r\nprecaution only made her the more anxious.\r\n\r\n\"The person whom we had lost trace of,\" said Fabry, without looking at\r\nPerrine, \"came on to Paris. There she died. Here is a copy of the death\r\ncertificate. It is in the name of Marie Doressany, widow of Edmond\r\nVulfran Paindavoine.\"\r\n\r\nWith trembling hands the blind man took the paper.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I read it to you?\" asked Fabry.\r\n\r\n\"No, if you have verified the names we will attend to that later. Go\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"I not only got the certificate; I wanted to question the man whom they\r\ncall Grain-of-Salt. She died in a room in his house. Then I saw all\r\nthose who were present at the poor woman's funeral. There was a street\r\nsinger called the Baroness and an old shoemaker called Carp. It was the\r\nmiserable existence which she had been forced to live that had finally\r\nkilled her. I even saw the doctor who attended her, Dr. Cendrier. He\r\nwanted her to go to the hospital, but she would not be parted from her\r\ndaughter. Finally, to complete my investigations, they sent me to a\r\nwoman who buys rags and bones. Her name is La Rouquerie. I could not see\r\nher until yesterday, as she had been out in the country.\"\r\n\r\nFabry paused. Then for the first time he turned to Perrine and bowed\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Palikare, mademoiselle,\" he said. \"He is looking very well.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine had risen to her feet. For some moments she stood listening,\r\ndazed. Then her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\"I then had to find out what had become of the little daughter,\"\r\ncontinued Fabry. \"This ragpicker told me that she had met her in the\r\nChantilly woods and that she was dying of hunger. It was her own donkey\r\nthat she sold to the ragpicker who found her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" cried M. Vulfran, turning his sightless eyes towards Perrine,\r\nwho was trembling from head to foot, \"why this little girl did not say\r\nwho she was? You understand how deeply a little girl can feel, so can\r\nyou explain this?\"\r\n\r\nPerrine took a few steps towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me why she does not come into my arms ... her grandfather's arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, grandpapa,\" cried Perrine, throwing her arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE GRATEFUL PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFabry had left the room, leaving the grandfather and his granddaughter\r\ntogether. For a long time the old man and the girl sat with their arms\r\nabout each other. They only spoke now and again, just to exchange a word\r\nof affection.\r\n\r\n\"My little granddaughter ... my boy's little girl,\" murmured the blind\r\nman, stroking her curls.\r\n\r\n\"My grandpapa,\" murmured Perrine, rubbing her soft cheek against his.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me who you were?\" he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"But didn't I try several times?\" replied Perrine. \"Do you remember what\r\nyou said to me the last time I spoke of dear mother and myself. You\r\nsaid: 'Understand, never speak to me again of those wretched\r\ncreatures.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But could I guess that you were my granddaughter?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"If I had come straight to you, don't you think you would have driven me\r\naway and not have listened to me?\" asked Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the blind man, sadly, \"who knows what I would have done!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said Perrine, \"and I thought it best not to let you\r\nknow me until, like mama said, 'you would get to love me.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have waited so long, and you had so many proofs of my\r\naffection.\"\r\n\r\n\"But was it the affection of a grandfather? I did not dare think so,\"\r\nsaid Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"When I began to suspect that you were my son's child, I then quickly\r\ngot positive proofs, and I gave you every chance to tell me that you\r\nwere. Finally I employed Fabry, who, with his investigations, forced you\r\nto throw yourself into my arms. If you had spoken sooner, my little\r\ndarling, you would have spared me many doubts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Perrine sweetly, \"but we are so happy now, and doesn't that\r\nprove that what I did was all for the best?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all is well. We will leave it at that. Now tell me all about your\r\nfather ... my boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot speak to you of my father without speaking of my mother,\" said\r\nPerrine gravely. \"They both loved me so much, and I loved them just the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\n\"My little girl,\" said the blind man, \"what Fabry has just told me of\r\nher has touched me deeply. She refused to go to the hospital where she\r\nmight have been cured because she would not leave you alone in\r\nParis....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; you would have loved her,\" cried Perrine; \"my darling mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk to me about her,\" said the old man, \"about them both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Perrine; \"I will make you know her and then you will love\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nPerrine told about their life before they lost all their money; then\r\nabout their travels through the various countries and the wanderings\r\nover the mountains; then of her father's illness and his death, and how\r\nshe and her sick mother journeyed through France with the hope that they\r\ncould reach Maraucourt in time before the sick woman died.\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking they could hear vague sounds outside in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter out there?\" asked M. Vulfran. Perrine went to the\r\nwindow. The lawns and drive were black with a crowd of men, women and\r\nchildren. They were dressed in their Sunday clothes; many of them\r\ncarried banners and flags. This crowd, between six and seven thousand\r\npeople, reached outside the grounds to the public park, and the murmur\r\nof their voices had reached the ears of the blind man and had turned his\r\nattention from Perrine's story, great though it was.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is your birthday today,\" said Perrine, smiling, \"and all your men\r\nare here to celebrate it and to thank you for all you have done for them\r\nand their families.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!...\"\r\n\r\nThe blind man walked to the window as though he could see them. He was\r\nrecognized and a murmur ran through the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"_Mon Dieu_,\" he murmured, \"how terrible they would be if they were\r\nagainst us.\" For the first time he realized the strength of the masses\r\nwhich he controlled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Perrine, \"but they are with us because we are with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, little girl, and it is all due to you,\" he replied. \"This is very\r\ndifferent from the day when the service for your dear father was held in\r\nthat empty church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are all here now,\" said Perrine, \"and this is the Order of\r\nthe Day, grandpapa dear: I am to guide you to the steps exactly at two\r\no'clock. From there everyone will be able to see you. A man representing\r\neach village where you have your factories will come up the steps, and\r\nfatherly old Gathoye in the name of all is to make a speech.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the clock struck two.\r\n\r\n\"Now give me your hand, grandpapa, dear,\" said Perrine.\r\n\r\nThey reached the top of the steps and a great cheer broke out. Then the\r\ndear old Gathoye, who was the oldest employé, came forward alone. He was\r\nfollowed by the five delegates. Ten times the old man had been made to\r\ngo over his speech that morning.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Vulfran, sir,\" he began, \"it is to wish you ... it is to\r\ncongratulate you ... to congratulate you on....\"\r\n\r\nHere he stopped short and began gesticulating with his hands, and the\r\ncrowd, who saw his eloquent gestures, thought that he making an\r\nelaborate speech.\r\n\r\nAfter some vain efforts, during which he scratched his head several\r\ntimes, he said: \"This is how it is: I had a fine speech all ready, but\r\nI've gone and forgot all I got to say. I had to congratulate you and\r\nthank you in the name of all from the bottom of our hearts....\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"I swear that's so on the faith of your oldest employé, Gathoye.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the speech was very incoherent, nevertheless it touched M.\r\nVulfran deeply. With his hand on Perrine's shoulder, he moved forward to\r\nthe balustrade. There all could see him from below.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" he called out in a loud voice, \"your sincere kind wishes\r\ngive me the greatest pleasure, all the more so as you bring them to me\r\non the happiest day of my life, the day when I have found my little\r\ngranddaughter, the daughter of my only son whom I have lost. You know\r\nher; you have seen her at the factory. She will go on with the work we\r\nhave already begun, and I promise you that your future, and your\r\nchildren's future, is in good hands.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon he leaned down towards Perrine and before she could protest he\r\nlifted her up in his arms that were still strong, and presented her to\r\nthe crowd, then kissed her tenderly.\r\n\r\nThen a deafening cheer rang out. It was continued for several minutes.\r\nCheers came from the mouths of seven thousand men, women and children.\r\nThen, as the Order of the Day had been previously arranged, a line was\r\nformed and in single file they passed before their old chief and his\r\ngranddaughter. With a bow and a hearty wish each man passed by.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, grandpapa, if you could only see their kind faces!\" cried Perrine.\r\n\r\nBut there were some faces that were not exactly radiant. The two nephews\r\ncertainly looked very glum when, after the ceremony, they came up to\r\ntheir cousin to offer their congratulations.\r\n\r\n\"As for me,\" said Talouel, who did not mean to lose any time in paying\r\ncourt to the young heiress, \"I had always supposed....\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the day proved too much for M. Vulfran. The doctor was\r\ncalled in.\r\n\r\n\"You can understand, doctor,\" said the blind man anxiously, \"how much I\r\nwant to see my little granddaughter. You must get me into a state so\r\nthat I can have this operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just it,\" said the doctor cheerily, \"you must not have all this\r\nexcitement. You must be perfectly calm. Now that this beautiful weather\r\nhas come, you must go out, but you must keep quiet, and I guarantee that\r\nas soon as your cough has gone we shall be able to have a successful\r\noperation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor's words came true. A month after M. Vulfran's birthday\r\ntwo specialists came down from Paris to perform the operation.\r\n\r\nWhen they wished to put him under an anesthetic he refused.\r\n\r\n\"If my granddaughter will have the courage to hold my hand,\" he said,\r\n\"you will see that I will be brave. Is it very painful?\"\r\n\r\nThey would use cocaine to alleviate the pain.\r\n\r\nThe operation was over. Then came five or six days of waiting. The\r\npatient was kept in a dark room. Then at last the grandfather was\r\nallowed to see his little granddaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if I had only had my eyes,\" he cried as he gazed at Perrine's\r\nbeautiful little face, \"I should have recognized her at the first\r\nglance. What fools! Couldn't anyone have seen the likeness to her\r\nfather? This time Talouel would have been right if he had said that he\r\n'supposed'....\"\r\n\r\nThey did not let him use his eyes for long. Again the bandage was put on\r\nand was kept on for thirty days. Then one of the oculists who had\r\nremained at the chateau went up to Paris to select the glasses which\r\nwould enable him to read and see at a distance.\r\n\r\nWhat M. Vulfran desired most, now that he had seen Perrine's sweet face,\r\nwas to go out and see his works, but this needed great precaution, and\r\nthe trip had to be postponed for a time, for he did not wish to be\r\nclosed up in a landau with the windows up, but to use his old phaeton\r\nand be driven by Perrine and show himself with her everywhere. For that\r\nthey had to wait for a warm, sunny day.\r\n\r\nAt last the day they wanted came. The sky was blue, the air soft and\r\nwarm. After luncheon Perrine gave the order to Bastien for the phaeton\r\nwith old Coco to be at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at once, mademoiselle,\" he said with a smile.\r\n\r\nPerrine was surprised at the tone of his reply and his smile; but she\r\npaid no more attention to it, as she was busy fussing about her\r\ngrandfather so that he would not take cold.\r\n\r\nPresently Bastien came to say that the phaeton was ready. Perrine's eyes\r\ndid not leave her grandfather as he walked forwards and down the steps\r\nalone. When they reached the last step a loud bray made her start. She\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\nThere stood a donkey harnessed to a phaeton! A donkey, and that donkey\r\nwas like Palikare, a Palikare shiny and glossy, with polished shoes and\r\nadorned with a beautiful yellow harness with blue tassels. The donkey,\r\nwith his neck stretched out, continued to bray. In spite of the groom's\r\nhold upon him he turned and tried to get to Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Palikare!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nShe flew to him and flung her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, grandpapa, what a lovely surprise!\" she cried, dancing around her\r\ndear Palikare.\r\n\r\n\"You don't owe it to me,\" said her grandfather. \"Fabry bought it from\r\nthat ragpicker to whom you sold it. The office staff offer it as a gift\r\nto their old comrade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hasn't Monsieur Fabry got a good, kind heart!\" cried Perrine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he thought of it, but your cousins did not,\" said M. Vulfran. \"I\r\nhave ordered a pretty cart from Paris for him. This phaeton is not the\r\nthing for him.\"\r\n\r\nThey got up into the carriage and Perrine took the reins delightedly.\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we go first, grandpapa?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, to the log cabin,\" he said. \"Don't you think I want to see the\r\nlittle nest where you once lived, my darling?\"\r\n\r\nHe referred to the cabin on the island where she had lived for a time\r\nthe preceding year. It remained fondly in his mind. She drove on to the\r\nentrance and helped her grandfather alight at the path.\r\n\r\nThe cabin seemed just the same as when Perrine left it.\r\n\r\n\"How strange,\" said M. Vulfran, \"that only a few steps from a great\r\nindustrial center you were able to live the life of a savage here.\"\r\n\r\n\"In India we led a real savage life,\" said Perrine. \"Everything around\r\nus belonged to us there, but here, I had no right to this and I was\r\noften very afraid.\"\r\n\r\nAfter M. Vulfran had inspected the little log hut he wanted to see the\r\ncrèche at Maraucourt.\r\n\r\nHe thought that he would easily recognize it, as he had so often discussed\r\nthe plans with Fabry, but when he found himself at the entrance, and was\r\nable to see at a glance all the other rooms, the dormitory where the\r\nlittle babies were asleep in their rose and blue cribs according to the\r\nsex, the playroom where those who could walk were playing, the kitchen,\r\nthe lavatory, he was surprised and delighted.\r\n\r\nUsing large glass doors, the architect had cleverly made his plans so\r\nthat from the first room the mothers could see all that went on in the\r\nother rooms where they were not allowed to enter.\r\n\r\nIn the nursery the children sprang forward and jumped upon Perrine,\r\nshowing her the playthings that they had in their hands.\r\n\r\n\"I see that you are known here,\" said M. Vulfran.\r\n\r\n\"Known!\" replied Mlle. Belhomme, greeting them. \"She is loved by all;\r\nshe is a little mother to them, and no one can play like she can.\"\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran put his arms affectionately around his granddaughter as\r\nthey went on to the carriage.\r\n\r\nThey returned home slowly as evening fell. Then as they passed from one\r\nhill to another, they found themselves overlooking the surrounding\r\ncountry, where new roofs and tall chimneys could be seen everywhere.\r\n\r\nM. Vulfran took Perrine's hand.\r\n\r\n\"All that is your work, child,\" he said; \"I only thought of business.\r\nSee what you have done. But so that this can all be continued in the\r\nyears to come, we shall have to find you a husband, one who will be\r\nworthy of you, who will work for us. We will not ask anything more of him.\r\nI think one day we shall find the right man and we shall all be happy\r\n... en famille....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BERRY PATCH\r\n\r\nJosephine Lawrence\r\n\r\n_12mo.

In the process of interesting events, the\r\n    reform of the family brought about the reform of the\r\n    community, with unhappy dispositions changed into\r\n    lovable characters, that make good citizens and reach\r\n    social success._\r\n\r\nElspeth Oliver is the girl whose energy keeps things whirling in the\r\nBerry Patch. Judge Berry was the great authority on what's what among\r\nthem, and John Tabor, the school teacher, was the romantic character in\r\nthe community.

Shirley is the baby and pet of six years.\r\nAs she gets her own way so often, she is badly spoiled and receives many\r\nhard knocks before she begins to appreciate the comfort and interest of\r\nothers. Dr. Hugh is their big brother, who has the care of them in the\r\nabsence of their parents, and he ranges in their estimation all the way\r\nfrom terrible tyrant to wonderful, necessary brother. There are others\r\nwho help complicate as well as untangle troubles, and fill up the\r\nexperience of the story with interesting glimpses of life.\r\n\r\n_Send for Our Free Illustrated Catalogue._\r\n\r\n\r\nCUPPLES & LEON COMPANY, PUBLISHERS New York",
