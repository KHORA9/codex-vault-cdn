Now at the time when this great concussion of affairs happened, the\r\naffairs of the Romans were themselves in great disorder. Those Jews also\r\nwho were for innovations, then arose when the times were disturbed; they\r\nwere also in a flourishing condition for strength and riches, insomuch\r\nthat the affairs of the East were then exceeding tumultuous, while some\r\nhoped for gain, and others were afraid of loss in such troubles; for the\r\nJews hoped that all of their nation which were beyond Euphrates would\r\nhave raised an insurrection together with them. The Gauls also, in the\r\nneighborhood of the Romans, were in motion, and the Geltin were\r\nnot quiet; but all was in disorder after the death of Nero. And the\r\nopportunity now offered induced many to aim at the royal power; and the\r\nsoldiery affected change, out of the hopes of getting money. I thought\r\nit therefore an absurd thing to see the truth falsified in affairs of\r\nsuch great consequence, and to take no notice of it; but to suffer those\r\nGreeks and Romans that were not in the wars to be ignorant of these\r\nthings, and to read either flatteries or fictions, while the Parthians,\r\nand the Babylonians, and the remotest Arabians, and those of our nation\r\nbeyond Euphrates, with the Adiabeni, by my means, knew accurately both\r\nwhence the war begun, what miseries it brought upon us, and after what\r\nmanner it ended.\r\n\r\n3. It is true, these writers have the confidence to call their accounts\r\nhistories; wherein yet they seem to me to fail of their own purpose,\r\nas well as to relate nothing that is sound. For they have a mind to\r\ndemonstrate the greatness of the Romans, while they still diminish and\r\nlessen the actions of the Jews, as not discerning how it cannot be that\r\nthose must appear to be great who have only conquered those that were\r\nlittle. Nor are they ashamed to overlook the length of the war, the\r\nmultitude of the Roman forces who so greatly suffered in it, or the\r\nmight of the commanders, whose great labors about Jerusalem will be\r\ndeemed inglorious, if what they achieved be reckoned but a small matter.\r\n\r\n4. However, I will not go to the other extreme, out of opposition to\r\nthose men who extol the Romans nor will I determine to raise the actions\r\nof my countrymen too high; but I will prosecute the actions of both\r\nparties with accuracy. Yet shall I suit my language to the passions I am\r\nunder, as to the affairs I describe, and must be allowed to indulge some\r\nlamentations upon the miseries undergone by my own country. For that it\r\nwas a seditious temper of our own that destroyed it, and that they were\r\nthe tyrants among the Jews who brought the Roman power upon us, who\r\nunwillingly attacked us, and occasioned the burning of our holy temple,\r\nTitus Caesar, who destroyed it, is himself a witness, who, during the\r\nentire war, pitied the people who were kept under by the seditious, and\r\ndid often voluntarily delay the taking of the city, and allowed time to\r\nthe siege, in order to let the authors have opportunity for repentance.\r\nBut if any one makes an unjust accusation against us, when we speak so\r\npassionately about the tyrants, or the robbers, or sorely bewail the\r\nmisfortunes of our country, let him indulge my affections herein, though\r\nit be contrary to the rules for writing history; because it had so\r\ncome to pass, that our city Jerusalem had arrived at a higher degree of\r\nfelicity than any other city under the Roman government, and yet at last\r\nfell into the sorest of calamities again. Accordingly, it appears to\r\nme that the misfortunes of all men, from the beginning of the world, if\r\nthey be compared to these of the Jews 3 are not so considerable as they\r\nwere; while the authors of them were not foreigners neither. This makes\r\nit impossible for me to contain my lamentations. But if any one be\r\ninflexible in his censures of me, let him attribute the facts themselves\r\nto the historical part, and the lamentations to the writer himself only.\r\n\r\n5. However, I may justly blame the learned men among the Greeks, who,\r\nwhen such great actions have been done in their own times, which, upon\r\nthe comparison, quite eclipse the old wars, do yet sit as judges of\r\nthose affairs, and pass bitter censures upon the labors of the best\r\nwriters of antiquity; which moderns, although they may be superior\r\nto the old writers in eloquence, yet are they inferior to them in\r\nthe execution of what they intended to do. While these also write new\r\nhistories about the Assyrians and Medes, as if the ancient writers had\r\nnot described their affairs as they ought to have done; although these\r\nbe as far inferior to them in abilities as they are different in their\r\nnotions from them. For of old every one took upon them to write what\r\nhappened in his own time; where their immediate concern in the actions\r\nmade their promises of value; and where it must be reproachful to write\r\nlies, when they must be known by the readers to be such. But then,\r\nan undertaking to preserve the memory Of what hath not been before\r\nrecorded, and to represent the affairs of one's own time to those that\r\ncome afterwards, is really worthy of praise and commendation. Now he is\r\nto be esteemed to have taken good pains in earnest, not who does no more\r\nthan change the disposition and order of other men's works, but he\r\nwho not only relates what had not been related before, but composes an\r\nentire body of history of his own: accordingly, I have been at great\r\ncharges, and have taken very great pains [about this history], though\r\nI be a foreigner; and do dedicate this work, as a memorial of great\r\nactions, both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians. But for some of our\r\nown principal men, their mouths are wide open, and their tongues loosed\r\npresently, for gain and law-suits, but quite muzzled up when they are\r\nto write history, where they must speak truth and gather facts together\r\nwith a great deal of pains; and so they leave the writing such histories\r\nto weaker people, and to such as are not acquainted with the actions of\r\nprinces. Yet shall the real truth of historical facts be preferred by\r\nus, how much soever it be neglected among the Greek historians.\r\n\r\n6. To write concerning the Antiquities of the Jews, who they were\r\n[originally], and how they revolted from the Egyptians, and what country\r\nthey traveled over, and what countries they seized upon afterward,\r\nand how they were removed out of them, I think this not to be a fit\r\nopportunity, and, on other accounts, also superfluous; and this because\r\nmany Jews before me have composed the histories of our ancestors very\r\nexactly; as have some of the Greeks done it also, and have translated\r\nour histories into their own tongue, and have not much mistaken the\r\ntruth in their histories. But then, where the writers of these affairs\r\nand our prophets leave off, thence shall I take my rise, and begin my\r\nhistory. Now as to what concerns that war which happened in my own time,\r\nI will go over it very largely, and with all the diligence I am able;\r\nbut for what preceded mine own age, that I shall run over briefly.\r\n\r\n7. [For example, I shall relate] how Antiochus, who was named Epiphanes,\r\ntook Jerusalem by force, and held it three years and three months, and\r\nwas then ejected out of the country by the sons of Asamoneus: after\r\nthat, how their posterity quarreled about the government, and brought\r\nupon their settlement the Romans and Pompey; how Herod also, the son of\r\nAntipater, dissolved their government, and brought Sosins upon them; as\r\nalso how our people made a sedition upon Herod's death, while Augustus\r\nwas the Roman emperor, and Quintilius Varus was in that country; and\r\nhow the war broke out in the twelfth year of Nero, with what happened to\r\nCestius; and what places the Jews assaulted in a hostile manner in the\r\nfirst sallies of the war.\r\n\r\n8. As also [I shall relate] how they built walls about the neighboring\r\ncities; and how Nero, upon Cestius's defeat, was in fear of the entire\r\nevent of the war, and thereupon made Vespasian general in this war; and\r\nhow this Vespasian, with the elder of his sons 4 made an expedition into\r\nthe country of Judea; what was the number of the Roman army that he made\r\nuse of; and how many of his auxiliaries were cut off in all Galilee;\r\nand how he took some of its cities entirely, and by force, and others\r\nof them by treaty, and on terms. Now, when I am come so far, I shall\r\ndescribe the good order of the Romans in war, and the discipline of\r\ntheir legions; the amplitude of both the Galilees, with its nature, and\r\nthe limits of Judea. And, besides this, I shall particularly go over\r\nwhat is peculiar to the country, the lakes and fountains that are in\r\nthem, and what miseries happened to every city as they were taken; and\r\nall this with accuracy, as I saw the things done, or suffered in them.\r\nFor I shall not conceal any of the calamities I myself endured, since I\r\nshall relate them to such as know the truth of them.\r\n\r\n9. After this, [I shall relate] how, When the Jews' affairs were\r\nbecome very bad, Nero died, and Vespasian, when he was going to attack\r\nJerusalem, was called back to take the government upon him; what signs\r\nhappened to him relating to his gaining that government, and what\r\nmutations of government then happened at Rome, and how he was\r\nunwillingly made emperor by his soldiers; and how, upon his departure to\r\nEgypt, to take upon him the government of the empire, the affairs of\r\nthe Jews became very tumultuous; as also how the tyrants rose up against\r\nthem, and fell into dissensions among themselves.\r\n\r\n10. Moreover, [I shall relate] how Titus marched out of Egypt into Judea\r\nthe second time; as also how, and where, and how many forces he got\r\ntogether; and in what state the city was, by the means of the seditious,\r\nat his coming; what attacks he made, and how many ramparts he cast up;\r\nof the three walls that encompassed the city, and of their measures;\r\nof the strength of the city, and the structure of the temple and holy\r\nhouse; and besides, the measures of those edifices, and of the altar,\r\nand all accurately determined. A description also of certain of\r\ntheir festivals, and seven purifications of purity, 5 and the sacred\r\nministrations of the priests, with the garments of the priests, and\r\nof the high priests; and of the nature of the most holy place of the\r\ntemple; without concealing any thing, or adding any thing to the known\r\ntruth of things.\r\n\r\n11. After this, I shall relate the barbarity of the tyrants towards the\r\npeople of their own nation, as well as the indulgence of the Romans in\r\nsparing foreigners; and how often Titus, out of his desire to preserve\r\nthe city and the temple, invited the seditious to come to terms of\r\naccommodation. I shall also distinguish the sufferings of the people,\r\nand their calamities; how far they were afflicted by the sedition, and\r\nhow far by the famine, and at length were taken. Nor shall I omit to\r\nmention the misfortunes of the deserters, nor the punishments inflicted\r\non the captives; as also how the temple was burnt, against the consent\r\nof Caesar; and how many sacred things that had been laid up in the\r\ntemple were snatched out of the fire; the destruction also of the entire\r\ncity, with the signs and wonders that went before it; and the taking the\r\ntyrants captives, and the multitude of those that were made slaves,\r\nand into what different misfortunes they were every one distributed.\r\nMoreover, what the Romans did to the remains of the wall; and how they\r\ndemolished the strong holds that were in the country; and how Titus\r\nwent over the whole country, and settled its affairs; together with his\r\nreturn into Italy, and his triumph.\r\n\r\n12. I have comprehended all these things in seven books, and have left\r\nno occasion for complaint or accusation to such as have been acquainted\r\nwith this war; and I have written it down for the sake of those that\r\nlove truth, but not for those that please themselves [with fictitious\r\nrelations]. And I will begin my account of these things with what I call\r\nmy First Chapter.\r\n\r\nWAR PREFACE FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ I have already observed more than once, that this History\r\nof the Jewish War was Josephus's first work, and published about A.D.\r\n75, when he was but thirty-eight years of age; and that when he wrote\r\nit, he was not thoroughly acquainted with several circumstances of\r\nhistory from the days of Antiochus Epiphanes, with which it begins, till\r\nnear his own times, contained in the first and former part of the\r\nsecond book, and so committed many involuntary errors therein. That he\r\npublished his Antiquities eighteen years afterward, in the thirteenth\r\nyear of Domitian, A.D. 93, when he was much more completely acquainted\r\nwith those ancient times, and after he had perused those most authentic\r\nhistories, the First Book of Maccabees, and the Chronicles of the\r\nPriesthood of John Hyrcanus, etc. That accordingly he then reviewed\r\nthose parts of this work, and gave the public a more faithful, complete,\r\nand accurate account of the facts therein related; and honestly\r\ncorrected the errors he had before run into.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Who these Upper Barbarians, remote from the sea, were,\r\nJosephus himself will inform us, sect. 2, viz. the Parthians and\r\nBabylonians, and remotest Arabians [of the Jews among them]; besides the\r\nJews beyond Euphrates, and the Adiabeni, or Assyrians. Whence we also\r\nlearn that these Parthians, Babylonians, the remotest Arabians, [or at\r\nleast the Jews among them,] as also the Jews beyond Euphrates, and\r\nthe Adiabeni, or Assyrians, understood Josephus's Hebrew, or rather\r\nChaldaic, books of The Jewish War, before they were put into the Greek\r\nlanguage.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ That these calamities of the Jews, who were our Savior's\r\nmurderers, were to be the greatest that had ever been since the beginning\r\nof the world, our Savior had directly foretold, Matthew 24:21; Mark\r\n13:19; Luke 21:23, 24; and that they proved to be such accordingly,\r\nJosephus is here a most authentic witness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ Titus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ These seven, or rather five, degrees of purity, or\r\npurification, are enumerated hereafter, B. V. ch. 5. sect. 6. The\r\nRabbins make ten degrees of them, as Reland there informs us.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Containing The Interval Of One Hundred And Sixty-Seven\r\n     Years.\r\n\r\n     From The Taking Of Jerusalem By Antiochus Epiphanes,\r\n     To The Death Of Herod The Great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The City Jerusalem Was Taken, And The Temple Pillaged\r\n     [By Antiochus Epiphanes]. As Also Concerning The Actions Of\r\n     The Maccabees, Matthias And Judas; And Concerning The Death\r\n     Of Judas.\r\n\r\n1. At the same time that Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, had a\r\nquarrel with the sixth Ptolemy about his right to the whole country of\r\nSyria, a great sedition fell among the men of power in Judea, and they\r\nhad a contention about obtaining the government; while each of those\r\nthat were of dignity could not endure to be subject to their equals.\r\nHowever, Onias, one of the high priests, got the better, and cast the\r\nsons of Tobias out of the city; who fled to Antiochus, and besought\r\nhim to make use of them for his leaders, and to make an expedition into\r\nJudea. The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them,\r\nand came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force,\r\nand slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out\r\nhis soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple,\r\nand put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice\r\nof expiation for three years and six months. But Onias, the high\r\npriest, fled to Ptolemy, and received a place from him in the Nomus of\r\nHeliopolis, where he built a city resembling Jerusalem, and a temple\r\nthat was like its temple 1 concerning which we shall speak more in its\r\nproper place hereafter.\r\n\r\n2. Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking\r\nthe city, or with its pillage, or with the great slaughter he had made\r\nthere; but being overcome with his violent passions, and remembering\r\nwhat he had suffered during the siege, he compelled the Jews to dissolve\r\nthe laws of their country, and to keep their infants uncircumcised,\r\nand to sacrifice swine's flesh upon the altar; against which they all\r\nopposed themselves, and the most approved among them were put to death.\r\nBacchides also, who was sent to keep the fortresses, having these wicked\r\ncommands, joined to his own natural barbarity, indulged all sorts of the\r\nextremest wickedness, and tormented the worthiest of the inhabitants,\r\nman by man, and threatened their city every day with open destruction,\r\ntill at length he provoked the poor sufferers by the extremity of his\r\nwicked doings to avenge themselves.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly Matthias, the son of Asamoneus, one of the priests who\r\nlived in a village called Modin, armed himself, together with his\r\nown family, which had five sons of his in it, and slew Bacchides with\r\ndaggers; and thereupon, out of the fear of the many garrisons [of the\r\nenemy], he fled to the mountains; and so many of the people followed\r\nhim, that he was encouraged to come down from the mountains, and to give\r\nbattle to Antiochus's generals, when he beat them, and drove them out of\r\nJudea. So he came to the government by this his success, and became\r\nthe prince of his own people by their own free consent, and then died,\r\nleaving the government to Judas, his eldest son.\r\n\r\n4. Now Judas, supposing that Antiochus would not lie still, gathered an\r\narmy out of his own countrymen, and was the first that made a league of\r\nfriendship with the Romans, and drove Epiphanes out of the country when\r\nhe had made a second expedition into it, and this by giving him a great\r\ndefeat there; and when he was warmed by this great success, he made an\r\nassault upon the garrison that was in the city, for it had not been cut\r\noff hitherto; so he ejected them out of the upper city, and drove the\r\nsoldiers into the lower, which part of the city was called the Citadel.\r\nHe then got the temple under his power, and cleansed the whole\r\nplace, and walled it round about, and made new vessels for sacred\r\nministrations, and brought them into the temple, because the former\r\nvessels had been profaned. He also built another altar, and began to\r\noffer the sacrifices; and when the city had already received its sacred\r\nconstitution again, Antiochus died; whose son Antiochus succeeded him in\r\nthe kingdom, and in his hatred to the Jews also.\r\n\r\n5. So this Antiochus got together fifty thousand footmen, and five\r\nthousand horsemen, and fourscore elephants, and marched through Judea\r\ninto the mountainous parts. He then took Bethsura, which was a small\r\ncity; but at a place called Bethzacharis, where the passage was narrow,\r\nJudas met him with his army. However, before the forces joined battle,\r\nJudas's brother Eleazar, seeing the very highest of the elephants\r\nadorned with a large tower, and with military trappings of gold to guard\r\nhim, and supposing that Antiochus himself was upon him, he ran a great\r\nway before his own army, and cutting his way through the enemy's troops,\r\nhe got up to the elephant; yet could he not reach him who seemed to be\r\nthe king, by reason of his being so high; but still he ran his weapon\r\ninto the belly of the beast, and brought him down upon himself, and was\r\ncrushed to death, having done no more than attempted great things, and\r\nshowed that he preferred glory before life. Now he that governed the\r\nelephant was but a private man; and had he proved to be Antiochus,\r\nEleazar had performed nothing more by this bold stroke than that it\r\nmight appear he chose to die, when he had the bare hope of thereby\r\ndoing a glorious action; nay, this disappointment proved an omen to his\r\nbrother [Judas] how the entire battle would end. It is true that the\r\nJews fought it out bravely for a long time, but the king's forces,\r\nbeing superior in number, and having fortune on their side, obtained\r\nthe victory. And when a great many of his men were slain, Judas took the\r\nrest with him, and fled to the toparchy of Gophna. So Antiochus went to\r\nJerusalem, and staid there but a few days, for he wanted provisions,\r\nand so he went his way. He left indeed a garrison behind him, such as he\r\nthought sufficient to keep the place, but drew the rest of his army off,\r\nto take their winter-quarters in Syria.\r\n\r\n6. Now, after the king was departed, Judas was not idle; for as many of\r\nhis own nation came to him, so did he gather those that had escaped out\r\nof the battle together, and gave battle again to Antiochus's generals\r\nat a village called Adasa; and being too hard for his enemies in the\r\nbattle, and killing a great number of them, he was at last himself slain\r\nalso. Nor was it many days afterward that his brother John had a plot\r\nlaid against him by Antiochus's party, and was slain by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning The Successors Of Judas, Who Were Jonathan And\r\n     Simon, And John Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n1. When Jonathan, who was Judas's brother, succeeded him, he behaved\r\nhimself with great circumspection in other respects, with relation to\r\nhis own people; and he corroborated his authority by preserving his\r\nfriendship with the Romans. He also made a league with Antiochus the\r\nson. Yet was not all this sufficient for his security; for the tyrant\r\nTrypho, who was guardian to Antiochus's son, laid a plot against\r\nhim; and besides that, endeavored to take off his friends, and caught\r\nJonathan by a wile, as he was going to Ptolemais to Antiochus, with\r\na few persons in his company, and put him in bonds, and then made an\r\nexpedition against the Jews; but when he was afterward driven away by\r\nSimon, who was Jonathan's brother, and was enraged at his defeat, he put\r\nJonathan to death.\r\n\r\n2. However, Simon managed the public affairs after a courageous manner,\r\nand took Gazara, and Joppa, and Jamnia, which were cities in his\r\nneighborhood. He also got the garrison under, and demolished the\r\ncitadel. He was afterward an auxiliary to Antiochus, against Trypho,\r\nwhom he besieged in Dora, before he went on his expedition against the\r\nMedes; yet could not he make the king ashamed of his ambition, though\r\nhe had assisted him in killing Trypho; for it was not long ere Antiochus\r\nsent Cendebeus his general with an army to lay waste Judea, and to\r\nsubdue Simon; yet he, though he was now in years, conducted the war\r\nas if he were a much younger man. He also sent his sons with a band of\r\nstrong men against Antiochus, while he took part of the army himself\r\nwith him, and fell upon him from another quarter. He also laid a great\r\nmany men in ambush in many places of the mountains, and was superior\r\nin all his attacks upon them; and when he had been conqueror after so\r\nglorious a manner, he was made high priest, and also freed the Jews from\r\nthe dominion of the Macedonians, after one hundred and seventy years of\r\nthe empire [of Seleucus].\r\n\r\n3. This Simon also had a plot laid against him, and was slain at a feast\r\nby his son-in-law Ptolemy, who put his wife and two sons into prison,\r\nand sent some persons to kill John, who was also called Hyrcanus. 2\r\nBut when the young man was informed of their coming beforehand, he\r\nmade haste to get to the city, as having a very great confidence in the\r\npeople there, both on account of the memory of the glorious actions of\r\nhis father, and of the hatred they could not but bear to the injustice\r\nof Ptolemy. Ptolemy also made an attempt to get into the city by another\r\ngate; but was repelled by the people, who had just then admitted of\r\nHyrcanus; so he retired presently to one of the fortresses that were\r\nabout Jericho, which was called Dagon. Now when Hyrcanus had received\r\nthe high priesthood, which his father had held before, and had offered\r\nsacrifice to God, he made great haste to attack Ptolemy, that he might\r\nafford relief to his mother and brethren.\r\n\r\n4. So he laid siege to the fortress, and was superior to Ptolemy in\r\nother respects, but was overcome by him as to the just affection [he had\r\nfor his relations]; for when Ptolemy was distressed, he brought forth\r\nhis mother, and his brethren, and set them upon the wall, and beat them\r\nwith rods in every body's sight, and threatened, that unless he would\r\ngo away immediately, he would throw them down headlong; at which sight\r\nHyrcanus's commiseration and concern were too hard for his anger. But\r\nhis mother was not dismayed, neither at the stripes she received, nor\r\nat the death with which she was threatened; but stretched out her hands,\r\nand prayed her son not to be moved with the injuries that she suffered\r\nto spare the wretch; since it was to her better to die by the means of\r\nPtolemy, than to live ever so long, provided he might be punished for\r\nthe injuries he done to their family. Now John's case was this: When\r\nhe considered the courage of his mother, and heard her entreaty, he set\r\nabout his attacks; but when he saw her beaten, and torn to pieces\r\nwith the stripes, he grew feeble, and was entirely overcome by his\r\naffections. And as the siege was delayed by this means, the year of rest\r\ncame on, upon which the Jews rest every seventh year as they do on\r\nevery seventh day. On this year, therefore, Ptolemy was freed from being\r\nbesieged, and slew the brethren of John, with their mother, and fled to\r\nZeno, who was also called Cotylas, who was tyrant of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n5. And now Antiochus was so angry at what he had suffered from Simon,\r\nthat he made an expedition into Judea, and sat down before Jerusalem and\r\nbesieged Hyrcanus; but Hyrcanus opened the sepulcher of David, who was\r\nthe richest of all kings, and took thence about three thousand talents\r\nin money, and induced Antiochus, by the promise of three thousand\r\ntalents, to raise the siege. Moreover, he was the first of the Jews that\r\nhad money enough, and began to hire foreign auxiliaries also.\r\n\r\n6. However, at another time, when Antiochus was gone upon an expedition\r\nagainst the Medes, and so gave Hyrcanus an opportunity of being revenged\r\nupon him, he immediately made an attack upon the cities of Syria, as\r\nthinking, what proved to be the case with them, that he should find them\r\nempty of good troops. So he took Medaba and Samea, with the towns in\r\ntheir neighborhood, as also Shechem, and Gerizzim; and besides these,\r\n[he subdued] the nation of the Cutheans, who dwelt round about that\r\ntemple which was built in imitation of the temple at Jerusalem; he also\r\ntook a great many other cities of Idumea, with Adoreon and Marissa.\r\n7. He also proceeded as far as Samaria, where is now the city Sebaste,\r\nwhich was built by Herod the king, and encompassed it all round with a\r\nwall, and set his sons, Aristobulus and Antigonus, over the siege; who\r\npushed it on so hard, that a famine so far prevailed within the city,\r\nthat they were forced to eat what never was esteemed food. They\r\nalso invited Antiochus, who was called Cyzicenus, to come to their\r\nassistance; whereupon he got ready, and complied with their invitation,\r\nbut was beaten by Aristobulus and Antigonus; and indeed he was pursued\r\nas far as Scythopolis by these brethren, and fled away from them. So\r\nthey returned back to Samaria, and shut the multitude again within the\r\nwall; and when they had taken the city, they demolished it, and made\r\nslaves of its inhabitants. And as they had still great success in their\r\nundertakings, they did not suffer their zeal to cool, but marched with\r\nan army as far as Scythopolis, and made an incursion upon it, and laid\r\nwaste all the country that lay within Mount Carmel.\r\n\r\n8. But then these successes of John and of his sons made them be envied,\r\nand occasioned a sedition in the country; and many there were who got\r\ntogether, and would not be at rest till they brake out into open war,\r\nin which war they were beaten. So John lived the rest of his life very\r\nhappily, and administered the government after a most extraordinary\r\nmanner, and this for thirty-three entire years together. He died,\r\nleaving five sons behind him. He was certainly a very happy man, and\r\nafforded no occasion to have any complaint made of fortune on his\r\naccount. He it was who alone had three of the most desirable things in\r\nthe world,--the government of his nation, and the high priesthood, and\r\nthe gift of prophecy. For the Deity conversed with him, and he was\r\nnot ignorant of any thing that was to come afterward; insomuch that he\r\nforesaw and foretold that his two eldest sons would not continue masters\r\nof the government; and it will highly deserve our narration to describe\r\ntheir catastrophe, and how far inferior these men were to their father\r\nin felicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Aristobulus Was The First That Put A Diadem About His\r\n     Head; And After He Had Put His Mother And Brother To Death,\r\n     Died Himself, When He Had Reigned No More Than A Year.\r\n\r\n1. For after the death of their father, the elder of them, Aristobulus,\r\nchanged the government into a kingdom, and was the first that put a\r\ndiadem upon his head, four hundred seventy and one years and three\r\nmonths after our people came down into this country, when they were set\r\nfree from the Babylonian slavery. Now, of his brethren, he appeared to\r\nhave an affection for Antigonus, who was next to him, and made him his\r\nequal; but for the rest, he bound them, and put them in prison. He also\r\nput his mother in bonds, for her contesting the government with him;\r\nfor John had left her to be the governess of public affairs. He also\r\nproceeded to that degree of barbarity as to cause her to be pined to\r\ndeath in prison.\r\n\r\n2. But vengeance circumvented him in the affair of his brother\r\nAntigonus, whom he loved, and whom he made his partner in the kingdom;\r\nfor he slew him by the means of the calumnies which ill men about the\r\npalace contrived against him. At first, indeed, Aristobulus would\r\nnot believe their reports, partly out of the affection he had for his\r\nbrother, and partly because he thought that a great part of these tales\r\nwere owing to the envy of their relaters: however, as Antigonus came\r\nonce in a splendid manner from the army to that festival, wherein our\r\nancient custom is to make tabernacles for God, it happened, in those\r\ndays, that Aristobulus was sick, and that, at the conclusion of the\r\nfeast, Antigonus came up to it, with his armed men about him; and this\r\nwhen he was adorned in the finest manner possible; and that, in a great\r\nmeasure, to pray to God on the behalf of his brother. Now at this very\r\ntime it was that these ill men came to the king, and told him in what\r\na pompous manner the armed men came, and with what insolence Antigonus\r\nmarched, and that such his insolence was too great for a private person,\r\nand that accordingly he was come with a great band of men to kill him;\r\nfor that he could not endure this bare enjoyment of royal honor, when it\r\nwas in his power to take the kingdom himself.\r\n\r\n3. Now Aristobulus, by degrees, and unwillingly, gave credit to these\r\naccusations; and accordingly he took care not to discover his suspicion\r\nopenly, though he provided to be secure against any accidents; so he\r\nplaced the guards of his body in a certain dark subterranean passage;\r\nfor he lay sick in a place called formerly the Citadel, though\r\nafterwards its name was changed to Antonia; and he gave orders that if\r\nAntigonus came unarmed, they should let him alone; but if he came to him\r\nin his armor, they should kill him. He also sent some to let him know\r\nbeforehand that he should come unarmed. But, upon this occasion, the\r\nqueen very cunningly contrived the matter with those that plotted his\r\nruin, for she persuaded those that were sent to conceal the king's\r\nmessage; but to tell Antigonus how his brother had heard he had got a\r\nvery the suit of armor made with fine martial ornaments, in Galilee;\r\nand because his present sickness hindered him from coming and seeing all\r\nthat finery, he very much desired to see him now in his armor; because,\r\nsaid he, in a little time thou art going away from me.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as Antigonus heard this, the good temper of his brother not\r\nallowing him to suspect any harm from him, he came along with his armor\r\non, to show it to his brother; but when he was going along that dark\r\npassage which was called Strato's Tower, he was slain by the body\r\nguards, and became an eminent instance how calumny destroys all\r\ngood-will and natural affection, and how none of our good affections are\r\nstrong enough to resist envy perpetually.\r\n\r\n5. And truly any one would be surprised at Judas upon this occasion. He\r\nwas of the sect of the Essens, and had never failed or deceived men in\r\nhis predictions before. Now this man saw Antigonus as he was passing\r\nalong by the temple, and cried out to his acquaintance, [they were not a\r\nfew who attended upon him as his scholars,] \"O strange!\" said he, \"it is\r\ngood for me to die now, since truth is dead before me, and somewhat that\r\nI have foretold hath proved false; for this Antigonus is this day alive,\r\nwho ought to have died this day; and the place where he ought to be\r\nslain, according to that fatal decree, was Strato's Tower, which is at\r\nthe distance of six hundred furlongs from this place; and yet four hours\r\nof this day are over already; which point of time renders the prediction\r\nimpossible to be fill filled.\" And when the old man had said this, he\r\nwas dejected in his mind, and so continued. But in a little time news\r\ncame that Antigonus was slain in a subterraneous place, which was itself\r\nalso called Strato's Tower, by the same name with that Cesarea which lay\r\nby the sea-side; and this ambiguity it was which caused the prophet's\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n6. Hereupon Aristobulus repented of the great crime he had been guilty\r\nof, and this gave occasion to the increase of his distemper. He also\r\ngrew worse and worse, and his soul was constantly disturbed at the\r\nthoughts of what he had done, till his very bowels being torn to pieces\r\nby the intolerable grief he was under, he threw up a great quantity of\r\nblood. And as one of those servants that attended him carried out that\r\nblood, he, by some supernatural providence, slipped and fell down in the\r\nvery place where Antigonus had been slain; and so he spilt some of\r\nthe murderer's blood upon the spots of the blood of him that had been\r\nmurdered, which still appeared. Hereupon a lamentable cry arose among\r\nthe spectators, as if the servant had spilled the blood on purpose in\r\nthat place; and as the king heard that cry, he inquired what was the\r\ncause of it; and while nobody durst tell him, he pressed them so much\r\nthe more to let him know what was the matter; so at length, when he had\r\nthreatened them, and forced them to speak out, they told; whereupon he\r\nburst into tears, and groaned, and said, \"So I perceive I am not like\r\nto escape the all-seeing eye of God, as to the great crimes I have\r\ncommitted; but the vengeance of the blood of my kinsman pursues me\r\nhastily. O thou most impudent body! how long wilt thou retain a soul\r\nthat ought to die on account of that punishment it ought to suffer for a\r\nmother and a brother slain! How long shall I myself spend my blood drop\r\nby drop? let them take it all at once; and let their ghosts no longer be\r\ndisappointed by a few parcels of my bowels offered to them.\" As soon\r\nas he had said these words, he presently died, when he had reigned no\r\nlonger than a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     What Actions Were Done By Alexander Janneus, Who Reigned\r\n     Twenty-Seven Years.\r\n\r\n1. And now the king's wife loosed the king's brethren, and made\r\nAlexander king, who appeared both elder in age, and more moderate in his\r\ntemper than the rest; who, when he came to the government, slew one of\r\nhis brethren, as affecting to govern himself; but had the other of them\r\nin great esteem, as loving a quiet life, without meddling with public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n2. Now it happened that there was a battle between him and Ptolemy, who\r\nwas called Lathyrus, who had taken the city Asochis. He indeed slew a\r\ngreat many of his enemies, but the victory rather inclined to Ptolemy.\r\nBut when this Ptolemy was pursued by his mother Cleopatra, and retired\r\ninto Egypt, Alexander besieged Gadara, and took it; as also he did\r\nAmathus, which was the strongest of all the fortresses that were about\r\nJordan, and therein were the most precious of all the possessions of\r\nTheodorus, the son of Zeno. Whereupon Theodorus marched against him, and\r\ntook what belonged to himself as well as the king's baggage, and slew\r\nten thousand of the Jews. However, Alexander recovered this blow, and\r\nturned his force towards the maritime parts, and took Raphia and Gaza,\r\nwith Anthedon also, which was afterwards called Agrippias by king Herod.\r\n\r\n3. But when he had made slaves of the citizens of all these cities, the\r\nnation of the Jews made an insurrection against him at a festival; for\r\nat those feasts seditions are generally begun; and it looked as if he\r\nshould not be able to escape the plot they had laid for him, had not his\r\nforeign auxiliaries, the Pisidians and Cilicians, assisted him; for as\r\nto the Syrians, he never admitted them among his mercenary troops, on\r\naccount of their innate enmity against the Jewish nation. And when he\r\nhad slain more than six thousand of the rebels, he made an incursion\r\ninto Arabia; and when he had taken that country, together with the\r\nGileadires and Moabites, he enjoined them to pay him tribute, and\r\nreturned to Areathus; and as Theodorus was surprised at his great\r\nsuccess, he took the fortress, and demolished it.\r\n\r\n4. However, when he fought with Obodas, king of the Arabians, who had\r\nlaid an ambush for him near Golan, and a plot against him, he lost his\r\nentire army, which was crowded together in a deep valley, and broken to\r\npieces by the multitude of camels. And when he had made his escape to\r\nJerusalem, he provoked the multitude, which hated him before, to make\r\nan insurrection against him, and this on account of the greatness of the\r\ncalamity that he was under. However, he was then too hard for them; and,\r\nin the several battles that were fought on both sides, he slew not fewer\r\nthan fifty thousand of the Jews in the interval of six years. Yet had\r\nhe no reason to rejoice in these victories, since he did but consume his\r\nown kingdom; till at length he left off fighting, and endeavored to\r\ncome to a composition with them, by talking with his subjects. But this\r\nmutability and irregularity of his conduct made them hate him still\r\nmore. And when he asked them why they so hated him, and what he should\r\ndo in order to appease them, they said, by killing himself; for that it\r\nwould be then all they could do to be reconciled to him, who had done\r\nsuch tragical things to them, even when he was dead. At the same time\r\nthey invited Demetrius, who was called Eucerus, to assist them; and as\r\nhe readily complied with their requests, in hopes of great advantages,\r\nand came with his army, the Jews joined with those their auxiliaries\r\nabout Shechem.\r\n\r\n5. Yet did Alexander meet both these forces with one thousand horsemen,\r\nand eight thousand mercenaries that were on foot. He had also with him\r\nthat part of the Jews which favored him, to the number of ten thousand;\r\nwhile the adverse party had three thousand horsemen, and fourteen\r\nthousand footmen. Now, before they joined battle, the kings made\r\nproclamation, and endeavored to draw off each other's soldiers, and make\r\nthem revolt; while Demetrius hoped to induce Alexander's mercenaries\r\nto leave him, and Alexander hoped to induce the Jews that were with\r\nDemetrius to leave him. But since neither the Jews would leave off their\r\nrage, nor the Greeks prove unfaithful, they came to an engagement, and\r\nto a close fight with their weapons. In which battle Demetrius was\r\nthe conqueror, although Alexander's mercenaries showed the greatest\r\nexploits, both in soul and body. Yet did the upshot of this battle prove\r\ndifferent from what was expected, as to both of them; for neither did\r\nthose that invited Demetrius to come to them continue firm to him,\r\nthough he was conqueror; and six thousand Jews, out of pity to the\r\nchange of Alexander's condition, when he was fled to the mountains,\r\ncame over to him. Yet could not Demetrius bear this turn of affairs; but\r\nsupposing that Alexander was already become a match for him again, and\r\nthat all the nation would [at length] run to him, he left the country,\r\nand went his way.\r\n\r\n6. However, the rest of the [Jewish] multitude did not lay aside their\r\nquarrels with him, when the [foreign] auxiliaries were gone; but they\r\nhad a perpetual war with Alexander, until he had slain the greatest part\r\nof them, and driven the rest into the city Berneselis; and when he had\r\ndemolished that city, he carried the captives to Jerusalem. Nay, his\r\nrage was grown so extravagant, that his barbarity proceeded to the\r\ndegree of impiety; for when he had ordered eight hundred to be hung upon\r\ncrosses in the midst of the city, he had the throats of their wives and\r\nchildren cut before their eyes; and these executions he saw as he\r\nwas drinking and lying down with his concubines. Upon which so deep a\r\nsurprise seized on the people, that eight thousand of his opposers\r\nfled away the very next night, out of all Judea, whose flight was only\r\nterminated by Alexander's death; so at last, though not till late,\r\nand with great difficulty, he, by such actions, procured quiet to his\r\nkingdom, and left off fighting any more.\r\n\r\n7. Yet did that Antiochus, who was also called Dionysius, become an\r\norigin of troubles again. This man was the brother of Demetrius, and the\r\nlast of the race of the Seleucidae. 3 Alexander was afraid of him, when\r\nhe was marching against the Arabians; so he cut a deep trench between\r\nAntipatris, which was near the mountains, and the shores of Joppa; he\r\nalso erected a high wall before the trench, and built wooden towers,\r\nin order to hinder any sudden approaches. But still he was not able to\r\nexclude Antiochus, for he burnt the towers, and filled up the trenches,\r\nand marched on with his army. And as he looked upon taking his\r\nrevenge on Alexander, for endeavoring to stop him, as a thing of less\r\nconsequence, he marched directly against the Arabians, whose king\r\nretired into such parts of the country as were fittest for engaging the\r\nenemy, and then on the sudden made his horse turn back, which were in\r\nnumber ten thousand, and fell upon Antiochus's army while they were in\r\ndisorder, and a terrible battle ensued. Antiochus's troops, so long as\r\nhe was alive, fought it out, although a mighty slaughter was made among\r\nthem by the Arabians; but when he fell, for he was in the forefront, in\r\nthe utmost danger, in rallying his troops, they all gave ground, and the\r\ngreatest part of his army were destroyed, either in the action or the\r\nflight; and for the rest, who fled to the village of Cana, it happened\r\nthat they were all consumed by want of necessaries, a few only excepted.\r\n\r\n8. About this time it was that the people of Damascus, out of their\r\nhatred to Ptolemy, the son of Menhens, invited Aretas [to take the\r\ngovernment], and made him king of Celesyria. This man also made an\r\nexpedition against Judea, and beat Alexander in battle; but afterwards\r\nretired by mutual agreement. But Alexander, when he had taken\r\nPella, marched to Gerasa again, out of the covetous desire he had of\r\nTheodorus's possessions; and when he had built a triple wall about the\r\ngarrison, he took the place by force. He also demolished Golan, and\r\nSeleucia, and what was called the Valley of Antiochus; besides which,\r\nhe took the strong fortress of Gamala, and stripped Demetrius, who was\r\ngovernor therein, of what he had, on account of the many crimes laid to\r\nhis charge, and then returned into Judea, after he had been three whole\r\nyears in this expedition. And now he was kindly received of the nation,\r\nbecause of the good success he had. So when he was at rest from war,\r\nhe fell into a distemper; for he was afflicted with a quartan ague, and\r\nsupposed that, by exercising himself again in martial affairs, he\r\nshould get rid of this distemper; but by making such expeditions at\r\nunseasonable times, and forcing his body to undergo greater hardships\r\nthan it was able to bear, he brought himself to his end. He died,\r\ntherefore, in the midst of his troubles, after he had reigned seven and\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alexandra Reigns Nine Years, During Which Time The Pharisees\r\n     Were The Real Rulers Of The Nation.\r\n\r\n1. Now Alexander left the kingdom to Alexandra his wife, and depended\r\nupon it that the Jews would now very readily submit to her, because she\r\nhad been very averse to such cruelty as he had treated them with,\r\nand had opposed his violation of their laws, and had thereby got the\r\ngood-will of the people. Nor was he mistaken as to his expectations; for\r\nthis woman kept the dominion, by the opinion that the people had of her\r\npiety; for she chiefly studied the ancient customs of her country, and\r\ncast those men out of the government that offended against their holy\r\nlaws. And as she had two sons by Alexander, she made Hyrcanus the elder\r\nhigh priest, on account of his age, as also, besides that, on account of\r\nhis inactive temper, no way disposing him to disturb the public. But\r\nshe retained the younger, Aristobulus, with her as a private person, by\r\nreason of the warmth of his temper.\r\n\r\n2. And now the Pharisees joined themselves to her, to assist her in\r\nthe government. These are a certain sect of the Jews that appear more\r\nreligious than others, and seem to interpret the laws more accurately.\r\nNow Alexandra hearkened to them to an extraordinary degree, as being\r\nherself a woman of great piety towards God. But these Pharisees artfully\r\ninsinuated themselves into her favor by little and little, and became\r\nthemselves the real administrators of the public affairs: they banished\r\nand reduced whom they pleased; they bound and loosed [men] at their\r\npleasure; 4 and, to say all at once, they had the enjoyment of the royal\r\nauthority, whilst the expenses and the difficulties of it belonged to\r\nAlexandra. She was a sagacious woman in the management of great\r\naffairs, and intent always upon gathering soldiers together; so that she\r\nincreased the army the one half, and procured a great body of foreign\r\ntroops, till her own nation became not only very powerful at home, but\r\nterrible also to foreign potentates, while she governed other people,\r\nand the Pharisees governed her.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly, they themselves slew Diogenes, a person of figure,\r\nand one that had been a friend to Alexander; and accused him as having\r\nassisted the king with his advice, for crucifying the eight hundred men\r\n[before mentioned.] They also prevailed with Alexandra to put to death\r\nthe rest of those who had irritated him against them. Now she was so\r\nsuperstitious as to comply with their desires, and accordingly they slew\r\nwhom they pleased themselves. But the principal of those that were in\r\ndanger fled to Aristobulus, who persuaded his mother to spare the men on\r\naccount of their dignity, but to expel them out of the city, unless she\r\ntook them to be innocent; so they were suffered to go unpunished, and\r\nwere dispersed all over the country. But when Alexandra sent out her\r\narmy to Damascus, under pretense that Ptolemy was always oppressing\r\nthat city, she got possession of it; nor did it make any considerable\r\nresistance. She also prevailed with Tigranes, king of Armenia, who lay\r\nwith his troops about Ptolemais, and besieged Cleopatra, 5 by agreements\r\nand presents, to go away. Accordingly, Tigranes soon arose from\r\nthe siege, by reason of those domestic tumults which happened upon\r\nLucullus's expedition into Armenia.\r\n\r\n4. In the mean time, Alexandra fell sick, and Aristobulus, her younger\r\nson, took hold of this opportunity, with his domestics, of which he had\r\na great many, who were all of them his friends, on account of the warmth\r\nof their youth, and got possession of all the fortresses. He also used\r\nthe sums of money he found in them to get together a number of mercenary\r\nsoldiers, and made himself king; and besides this, upon Hyrcanus's\r\ncomplaint to his mother, she compassionated his case, and put\r\nAristobulus's wife and sons under restraint in Antonia, which was a\r\nfortress that joined to the north part of the temple. It was, as I have\r\nalready said, of old called the Citadel; but afterwards got the name of\r\nAntonia, when Antony was [lord of the East], just as the other cities,\r\nSebaste and Agrippias, had their names changed, and these given them\r\nfrom Sebastus and Agrippa. But Alexandra died before she could punish\r\nAristobulus for his disinheriting his brother, after she had reigned\r\nnine years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     When Hyrcanus Who Was Alexander's Heir, Receded From His\r\n     Claim To The Crown Aristobulus Is Made King; And Afterward\r\n     The Same Hyrcanus By The Means Of Antipater, Is Brought Back\r\n     By Abetas.

Now Hyrcanus was heir to the kingdom, and to him did his mother\r\ncommit it before she died; but Aristobulus was superior to him in power\r\nand magnanimity; and when there was a battle between them, to decide\r\nthe dispute about the kingdom, near Jericho, the greatest part deserted\r\nHyrcanus, and went over to Aristobulus; but Hyrcanus, with those of his\r\nparty who staid with him, fled to Antonia, and got into his power the\r\nhostages that might be for his preservation [which were Aristobulus's\r\nwife, with her children]; but they came to an agreement before things\r\nshould come to extremities, that Aristobulus should be king, and\r\nHyrcanus should resign that up, but retain all the rest of his\r\ndignities, as being the king's brother. Hereupon they were reconciled\r\nto each other in the temple, and embraced one another in a very kind\r\nmanner, while the people stood round about them; they also changed their\r\nhouses, while Aristobulus went to the royal palace, and Hyrcanus retired\r\nto the house of Aristobulus.\r\n\r\n2. Now those other people which were at variance with Aristobulus were\r\nafraid upon his unexpected obtaining the government; and especially this\r\nconcerned Antipater 6 whom Aristobulus hated of old. He was by birth\r\nan Idumean, and one of the principal of that nation, on account of his\r\nancestors and riches, and other authority to him belonging: he also\r\npersuaded Hyrcanus to fly to Aretas, the king of Arabia, and to lay\r\nclaim to the kingdom; as also he persuaded Aretas to receive Hyrcanus,\r\nand to bring him back to his kingdom: he also cast great reproaches upon\r\nAristobulus, as to his morals, and gave great commendations to Hyrcanus,\r\nand exhorted Aretas to receive him, and told him how becoming a filing\r\nit would be for him, who ruled so great a kingdom, to afford his\r\nassistance to such as are injured; alleging that Hyrcanus was treated\r\nunjustly, by being deprived of that dominion which belonged to him by\r\nthe prerogative of his birth. And when he had predisposed them both to\r\ndo what he would have them, he took Hyrcanus by night, and ran away from\r\nthe city, and, continuing his flight with great swiftness, he escaped to\r\nthe place called Petra, which is the royal seat of the king of Arabia,\r\nwhere he put Hyrcanus into Aretas's hand; and by discoursing much with\r\nhim, and gaining upon him with many presents, he prevailed with him\r\nto give him an army that might restore him to his kingdom. This\r\narmy consisted of fifty thousand footmen and horsemen, against which\r\nAristobulus was not able to make resistance, but was deserted in his\r\nfirst onset, and was driven to Jerusalem; he also had been taken\r\nat first by force, if Scaurus, the Roman general, had not come and\r\nseasonably interposed himself, and raised the siege. This Scaurus was\r\nsent into Syria from Armenia by Pompey the Great, when he fought against\r\nTigranes; so Scaurus came to Damascus, which had been lately taken by\r\nMetellus and Lollius, and caused them to leave the place; and, upon his\r\nhearing how the affairs of Judea stood, he made haste thither as to a\r\ncertain booty.\r\n\r\n3. As soon, therefore, as he was come into the country, there\r\ncame ambassadors from both the brothers, each of them desiring his\r\nassistance; but Aristobulus's three hundred talents had more weight with\r\nhim than the justice of the cause; which sum, when Scaurus had received,\r\nhe sent a herald to Hyrcanus and the Arabians, and threatened them with\r\nthe resentment of the Romans and of Pompey, unless they would raise\r\nthe siege. So Aretas was terrified, and retired out of Judea to\r\nPhiladelphia, as did Scaurus return to Damascus again; nor was\r\nAristobulus satisfied with escaping [out of his brother's hands,] but\r\ngathered all his forces together, and pursued his enemies, and fought\r\nthem at a place called Papyron, and slew about six thousand of them,\r\nand, together with them Antipater's brother Phalion.\r\n\r\n4. When Hyrcanus and Antipater were thus deprived of their hopes from\r\nthe Arabians, they transferred the same to their adversaries; and\r\nbecause Pompey had passed through Syria, and was come to Damascus, they\r\nfled to him for assistance; and, without any bribes, they made the same\r\nequitable pleas that they had used to Aretas, and besought him to hate\r\nthe violent behavior of Aristobulus, and to bestow the kingdom on him\r\nto whom it justly belonged, both on account of his good character and\r\non account of his superiority in age. However, neither was Aristobulus\r\nwanting to himself in this case, as relying on the bribes that Scaurus\r\nhad received: he was also there himself, and adorned himself after\r\na manner the most agreeable to royalty that he was able. But he soon\r\nthought it beneath him to come in such a servile manner, and could not\r\nendure to serve his own ends in a way so much more abject than he was\r\nused to; so he departed from Diospolis.\r\n\r\n5. At this his behavior Pompey had great indignation; Hyrcanus also and\r\nhis friends made great intercessions to Pompey; so he took not only his\r\nRoman forces, but many of his Syrian auxiliaries, and marched against\r\nAristobulus. But when he had passed by Pella and Scythopolis, and was\r\ncome to Corea, where you enter into the country of Judea, when you go\r\nup to it through the Mediterranean parts, he heard that Aristobulus was\r\nfled to Alexandrium, which is a strong hold fortified with the utmost\r\nmagnificence, and situated upon a high mountain; and he sent to him, and\r\ncommanded him to come down. Now his inclination was to try his fortune\r\nin a battle, since he was called in such an imperious manner, rather\r\nthan to comply with that call. However, he saw the multitude were in\r\ngreat fear, and his friends exhorted him to consider what the power of\r\nthe Romans was, and how it was irresistible; so he complied with their\r\nadvice, and came down to Pompey; and when he had made a long apology for\r\nhimself, and for the justness of his cause in taking the government,\r\nhe returned to the fortress. And when his brother invited him again [to\r\nplead his cause], he came down and spake about the justice of it, and\r\nthen went away without any hinderance from Pompey; so he was between\r\nhope and fear. And when he came down, it was to prevail with Pompey to\r\nallow him the government entirely; and when he went up to the citadel,\r\nit was that he might not appear to debase himself too low. However,\r\nPompey commanded him to give up his fortified places, and forced him to\r\nwrite to every one of their governors to yield them up; they having\r\nhad this charge given them, to obey no letters but what were of his\r\nown hand-writing. Accordingly he did what he was ordered to do; but had\r\nstill an indignation at what was done, and retired to Jerusalem, and\r\nprepared to fight with Pompey.\r\n\r\n6. But Pompey did not give him time to make any preparations [for a\r\nsiege], but followed him at his heels; he was also obliged to make haste\r\nin his attempt, by the death of Mithridates, of which he was informed\r\nabout Jericho. Now here is the most fruitful country of Judea, which\r\nbears a vast number of palm trees 7 besides the balsam tree, whose\r\nsprouts they cut with sharp stones, and at the incisions they gather the\r\njuice, which drops down like tears. So Pompey pitched his camp in that\r\nplace one night, and then hasted away the next morning to Jerusalem; but\r\nAristobulus was so affrighted at his approach, that he came and met him\r\nby way of supplication. He also promised him money, and that he would\r\ndeliver up both himself and the city into his disposal, and thereby\r\nmitigated the anger of Pompey. Yet did not he perform any of the\r\nconditions he had agreed to; for Aristobulus's party would not so much\r\nas admit Gabinius into the city, who was sent to receive the money that\r\nhe had promised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Pompey Had The City Of Jerusalem Delivered Up To Him But\r\n     Took The Temple By Force. How He Went Into The Holy Of\r\n     Holies; As Also What Were His Other Exploits In Judea.\r\n\r\n1. At this treatment Pompey was very angry, and took Aristobulus into\r\ncustody. And when he was come to the city, he looked about where he\r\nmight make his attack; for he saw the walls were so firm, that it would\r\nbe hard to overcome them; and that the valley before the walls was\r\nterrible; and that the temple, which was within that valley, was itself\r\nencompassed with a very strong wall, insomuch that if the city were\r\ntaken, that temple would be a second place of refuge for the enemy to\r\nretire to.\r\n\r\n2. Now as he was long in deliberating about this matter, a sedition\r\narose among the people within the city; Aristobulus's party being\r\nwilling to fight, and to set their king at liberty, while the party of\r\nHyrcanus were for opening the gates to Pompey; and the dread people were\r\nin occasioned these last to be a very numerous party, when they looked\r\nupon the excellent order the Roman soldiers were in. So Aristobulus's\r\nparty was worsted, and retired into the temple, and cut off the\r\ncommunication between the temple and the city, by breaking down the\r\nbridge that joined them together, and prepared to make an opposition to\r\nthe utmost; but as the others had received the Romans into the city, and\r\nhad delivered up the palace to him, Pompey sent Piso, one of his great\r\nofficers, into that palace with an army, who distributed a garrison\r\nabout the city, because he could not persuade any one of those that had\r\nfled to the temple to come to terms of accommodation; he then disposed\r\nall things that were round about them so as might favor their attacks,\r\nas having Hyrcanus's party very ready to afford them both counsel and\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n3. But Pompey himself filled up the ditch that was on the north side of\r\nthe temple, and the entire valley also, the army itself being obliged to\r\ncarry the materials for that purpose. And indeed it was a hard thing to\r\nfill up that valley, by reason of its immense depth, especially as\r\nthe Jews used all the means possible to repel them from their superior\r\nsituation; nor had the Romans succeeded in their endeavors, had not\r\nPompey taken notice of the seventh days, on which the Jews abstain\r\nfrom all sorts of work on a religious account, and raised his bank, but\r\nrestrained his soldiers from fighting on those days; for the Jews only\r\nacted defensively on sabbath days. But as soon as Pompey had filled\r\nup the valley, he erected high towers upon the bank, and brought those\r\nengines which they had fetched from Tyre near to the wall, and tried\r\nto batter it down; and the slingers of stones beat off those that stood\r\nabove them, and drove them away; but the towers on this side of the\r\ncity made very great resistance, and were indeed extraordinary both for\r\nlargeness and magnificence.\r\n\r\n4. Now here it was that, upon the many hardships which the Romans\r\nunderwent, Pompey could not but admire not only at the other instances\r\nof the Jews' fortitude, but especially that they did not at all intermit\r\ntheir religious services, even when they were encompassed with darts\r\non all sides; for, as if the city were in full peace, their daily\r\nsacrifices and purifications, and every branch of their religious\r\nworship, was still performed to God with the utmost exactness. Nor\r\nindeed when the temple was actually taken, and they were every day\r\nslain about the altar, did they leave off the instances of their Divine\r\nworship that were appointed by their law; for it was in the third\r\nmonth of the siege before the Romans could even with great difficulty\r\noverthrow one of the towers, and get into the temple. Now he that first\r\nof all ventured to get over the wall, was Faustus Cornelius the son of\r\nSylla; and next after him were two centurions, Furius and Fabius; and\r\nevery one of these was followed by a cohort of his own, who encompassed\r\nthe Jews on all sides, and slew them, some of them as they were running\r\nfor shelter to the temple, and others as they, for a while, fought in\r\ntheir own defense.\r\n\r\n5. And now did many of the priests, even when they saw their enemies\r\nassailing them with swords in their hands, without any disturbance, go\r\non with their Divine worship, and were slain while they were offering\r\ntheir drink-offerings, and burning their incense, as preferring the\r\nduties about their worship to God before their own preservation. The\r\ngreatest part of them were slain by their own countrymen, of the adverse\r\nfaction, and an innumerable multitude threw themselves down precipices;\r\nnay, some there were who were so distracted among the insuperable\r\ndifficulties they were under, that they set fire to the buildings that\r\nwere near to the wall, and were burnt together with them. Now of the\r\nJews were slain twelve thousand; but of the Romans very few were slain,\r\nbut a greater number was wounded.\r\n\r\n6. But there was nothing that affected the nation so much, in the\r\ncalamities they were then under, as that their holy place, which had\r\nbeen hitherto seen by none, should be laid open to strangers; for\r\nPompey, and those that were about him, went into the temple itself 8\r\nwhither it was not lawful for any to enter but the high priest, and\r\nsaw what was reposited therein, the candlestick with its lamps, and the\r\ntable, and the pouring vessels, and the censers, all made entirely\r\nof gold, as also a great quantity of spices heaped together, with two\r\nthousand talents of sacred money. Yet did not he touch that money, nor\r\nany thing else that was there reposited; but he commanded the ministers\r\nabout the temple, the very next day after he had taken it, to cleanse\r\nit, and to perform their accustomed sacrifices. Moreover, he made\r\nHyrcanus high priest, as one that not only in other respects had showed\r\ngreat alacrity, on his side, during the siege, but as he had been the\r\nmeans of hindering the multitude that was in the country from fighting\r\nfor Aristobulus, which they were otherwise very ready to have done;\r\nby which means he acted the part of a good general, and reconciled\r\nthe people to him more by benevolence than by terror. Now, among the\r\nCaptives, Aristobulus's father-in-law was taken, who was also his uncle:\r\nso those that were the most guilty he punished with decollation; but\r\nrewarded Faustus, and those with him that had fought so bravely,\r\nwith glorious presents, and laid a tribute upon the country, and upon\r\nJerusalem itself.\r\n\r\n7. He also took away from the nation all those cities that they had\r\nformerly taken, and that belonged to Celesyria, and made them subject to\r\nhim that was at that time appointed to be the Roman president there; and\r\nreduced Judea within its proper bounds. He also rebuilt Gadara, 9 that\r\nhad been demolished by the Jews, in order to gratify one Demetrius,\r\nwho was of Gadara, and was one of his own freed-men. He also made other\r\ncities free from their dominion, that lay in the midst of the country,\r\nsuch, I mean, as they had not demolished before that time; Hippos, and\r\nScythopolis, as also Pella, and Samaria, and Marissa; and besides these\r\nAshdod, and Jamnia, and Arethusa; and in like manner dealt he with the\r\nmaritime cities, Gaza, and Joppa, and Dora, and that which was\r\nanciently called Strato's Tower, but was afterward rebuilt with the\r\nmost magnificent edifices, and had its name changed to Cesarea, by king\r\nHerod. All which he restored to their own citizens, and put them under\r\nthe province of Syria; which province, together with Judea, and the\r\ncountries as far as Egypt and Euphrates, he committed to Scaurus as\r\ntheir governor, and gave him two legions to support him; while he made\r\nall the haste he could himself to go through Cilicia, in his way\r\nto Rome, having Aristobulus and his children along with him as his\r\ncaptives. They were two daughters and two sons; the one of which sons,\r\nAlexander, ran away as he was going; but the younger, Antigonus, with\r\nhis sisters, were carried to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alexander, The Son Of Aristobulus, Who Ran Away From Pompey,\r\n     Makes An Expedition Against Hyrcanus; But Being Overcome By\r\n     Gabinius He Delivers Up The Fortresses To Him. After This\r\n     Aristobulus Escapes From Rome And Gathers An Army Together;\r\n     But Being Beaten By The Romans, He Is Brought Back To Rome;\r\n     With Other Things Relating To Gabinius, Crassus And Cassius.\r\n\r\n1. In the mean time, Scaurus made an expedition into Arabia, but was\r\nstopped by the difficulty of the places about Petra. However, he laid\r\nwaste the country about Pella, though even there he was under great\r\nhardship; for his army was afflicted with famine. In order to supply\r\nwhich want, Hyrcanus afforded him some assistance, and sent him\r\nprovisions by the means of Antipater; whom also Scaurus sent to Aretas,\r\nas one well acquainted with him, to induce him to pay him money to buy\r\nhis peace. The king of Arabia complied with the proposal, and gave him\r\nthree hundred talents; upon which Scaurus drew his army out of Arabia 10\r\n\r\n2. But as for Alexander, that son of Aristobulus who ran away from\r\nPompey, in some time he got a considerable band of men together, and lay\r\nheavy upon Hyrcanus, and overran Judea, and was likely to overturn\r\nhim quickly; and indeed he had come to Jerusalem, and had ventured to\r\nrebuild its wall that was thrown down by Pompey, had not Gabinius, who\r\nwas sent as successor to Scaurus into Syria, showed his bravery, as in\r\nmany other points, so in making an expedition against Alexander; who, as\r\nhe was afraid that he would attack him, so he got together a large army,\r\ncomposed of ten thousand armed footmen, and fifteen hundred horsemen.\r\nHe also built walls about proper places; Alexandrium, and Hyrcanium, and\r\nMachaerus, that lay upon the mountains of Arabia.\r\n\r\n3. However, Gabinius sent before him Marcus Antonius, and followed\r\nhimself with his whole army; but for the select body of soldiers that\r\nwere about Antipater, and another body of Jews under the command of\r\nMalichus and Pitholaus, these joined themselves to those captains\r\nthat were about Marcus Antonius, and met Alexander; to which body came\r\nGabinius with his main army soon afterward; and as Alexander was not\r\nable to sustain the charge of the enemies' forces, now they were joined,\r\nhe retired. But when he was come near to Jerusalem, he was forced to\r\nfight, and lost six thousand men in the battle; three thousand of which\r\nfell down dead, and three thousand were taken alive; so he fled with the\r\nremainder to Alexandrium.\r\n\r\n4. Now when Gabinius was come to Alexandrium, because he found a great\r\nmany there en-camped, he tried, by promising them pardon for their\r\nformer offenses, to induce them to come over to him before it came to a\r\nfight; but when they would hearken to no terms of accommodation, he\r\nslew a great number of them, and shut up a great number of them in the\r\ncitadel. Now Marcus Antonius, their leader, signalized himself in this\r\nbattle, who, as he always showed great courage, so did he never show it\r\nso much as now; but Gabinius, leaving forces to take the citadel, went\r\naway himself, and settled the cities that had not been demolished,\r\nand rebuilt those that had been destroyed. Accordingly, upon his\r\ninjunctions, the following cities were restored: Scythopolis, and\r\nSamaria, and Anthedon, and Apollonia, and Jamnia, and Raphia, and\r\nMariassa, and Adoreus, and Gamala, and Ashdod, and many others; while\r\na great number of men readily ran to each of them, and became their\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n5. When Gabinius had taken care of these cities, he returned to\r\nAlexandrium, and pressed on the siege. So when Alexander despaired of\r\never obtaining the government, he sent ambassadors to him, and prayed\r\nhim to forgive what he had offended him in, and gave up to him the\r\nremaining fortresses, Hyrcanium and Machaerus, as he put Alexandrium\r\ninto his hands afterwards; all which Gabinius demolished, at the\r\npersuasion of Alexander's mother, that they might not be receptacles of\r\nmen in a second war. She was now there in order to mollify Gabinius, out\r\nof her concern for her relations that were captives at Rome, which were\r\nher husband and her other children. After this Gabinius brought Hyrcanus\r\nto Jerusalem, and committed the care of the temple to him; but ordained\r\nthe other political government to be by an aristocracy. He also parted\r\nthe whole nation into five conventions, assigning one portion to\r\nJerusalem, another to Gadara, that another should belong to Amathus, a\r\nfourth to Jericho, and to the fifth division was allotted Sepphoris,\r\na city of Galilee. So the people were glad to be thus freed from\r\nmonarchical government, and were governed for the future by all\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\n6. Yet did Aristobulus afford another foundation for new disturbances.\r\nHe fled away from Rome, and got together again many of the Jews that\r\nwere desirous of a change, such as had borne an affection to him of old;\r\nand when he had taken Alexandrium in the first place, he attempted to\r\nbuild a wall about it; but as soon as Gabinius had sent an army against\r\nhim under Siscuria, and Antonius, and Servilius, he was aware of it,\r\nand retreated to Machaerus. And as for the unprofitable multitude, he\r\ndismissed them, and only marched on with those that were armed, being to\r\nthe number of eight thousand, among whom was Pitholaus, who had been the\r\nlieutenant at Jerusalem, but deserted to Aristobulus with a thousand\r\nof his men; so the Romans followed him, and when it came to a battle,\r\nAristobulus's party for a long time fought courageously; but at length\r\nthey were overborne by the Romans, and of them five thousand fell down\r\ndead, and about two thousand fled to a certain little hill, but the\r\nthousand that remained with Aristobulus brake through the Roman army,\r\nand marched together to Machaerus; and when the king had lodged the\r\nfirst night upon its ruins, he was in hopes of raising another army, if\r\nthe war would but cease a while; accordingly, he fortified that strong\r\nhold, though it was done after a poor manner. But the Romans falling\r\nupon him, he resisted, even beyond his abilities, for two days, and then\r\nwas taken, and brought a prisoner to Gabinius, with Antigonus his son,\r\nwho had fled away together with him from Rome; and from Gabinius he was\r\ncarried to Rome again. Wherefore the senate put him under confinement,\r\nbut returned his children back to Judea, because Gabinius informed them\r\nby letters that he had promised Aristobulus's mother to do so, for her\r\ndelivering the fortresses up to him.\r\n\r\n7. But now as Gabinius was marching to the war against the Parthians,\r\nhe was hindered by Ptolemy, whom, upon his return from Euphrates, he\r\nbrought back into Egypt, making use of Hyrcanus and Antipater to provide\r\nevery thing that was necessary for this expedition; for Antipater\r\nfurnished him with money, and weapons, and corn, and auxiliaries; he\r\nalso prevailed with the Jews that were there, and guarded the avenues at\r\nPelusium, to let them pass. But now, upon Gabinius's absence, the other\r\npart of Syria was in motion, and Alexander, the son of Aristobulus,\r\nbrought the Jews to revolt again. Accordingly, he got together a very\r\ngreat army, and set about killing all the Romans that were in the\r\ncountry; hereupon Gabinius was afraid, [for he was come back already out\r\nof Egypt, and obliged to come back quickly by these tumults,] and\r\nsent Antipater, who prevailed with some of the revolters to be quiet.\r\nHowever, thirty thousand still continued with Alexander, who was himself\r\neager to fight also; accordingly, Gabinius went out to fight, when\r\nthe Jews met him; and as the battle was fought near Mount Tabor, ten\r\nthousand of them were slain, and the rest of the multitude dispersed\r\nthemselves, and fled away. So Gabinius came to Jerusalem, and settled\r\nthe government as Antipater would have it; thence he marched, and fought\r\nand beat the Nabateans: as for Mithridates and Orsanes, who fled out of\r\nParthin, he sent them away privately, but gave it out among the soldiers\r\nthat they had run away.\r\n\r\n8. In the mean time, Crassus came as successor to Gabinius in Syria. He\r\ntook away all the rest of the gold belonging to the temple of Jerusalem,\r\nin order to furnish himself for his expedition against the Parthians.\r\nHe also took away the two thousand talents which Pompey had not touched;\r\nbut when he had passed over Euphrates, he perished himself, and his army\r\nwith him; concerning which affairs this is not a proper time to speak\r\n[more largely].\r\n\r\n9. But now Cassius, after Crassus, put a stop to the Parthians, who were\r\nmarching in order to enter Syria. Cassius had fled into that province,\r\nand when he had taken possession of the same, he made a hasty march into\r\nJudea; and, upon his taking Taricheae, he carried thirty thousand Jews\r\ninto slavery. He also slew Pitholaus, who had supported the seditious\r\nfollowers of Aristobulus; and it was Antipater who advised him so to\r\ndo. Now this Antipater married a wife of an eminent family among the\r\nArabisus, whose name was Cypros, and had four sons born to him by her,\r\nPhasaelus and Herod, who was afterwards king, and, besides these, Joseph\r\nand Pheroras; and he had a daughter whose name was Salome. Now as he\r\nmade himself friends among the men of power every where, by the kind\r\noffices he did them, and the hospitable manner that he treated them;\r\nso did he contract the greatest friendship with the king of Arabia, by\r\nmarrying his relation; insomuch that when he made war with Aristobulus,\r\nhe sent and intrusted his children with him. So when Cassius had forced\r\nAlexander to come to terms and to be quiet, he returned to Euphrates,\r\nin order to prevent the Parthians from repassing it; concerning which\r\nmatter we shall speak elsewhere. 11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Aristobulus Is Taken Off By Pompey's Friends, As Is His Son\r\n     Alexander By Scipio. Antipater Cultivates A Friendship With\r\n     Caesar, After Pompey's Death; He Also Performs Great Actions\r\n     In That War, Wherein He Assisted Mithridates.\r\n\r\n1. Now, upon the flight of Pompey and of the senate beyond the Ionian\r\nSea, Caesar got Rome and the empire under his power, and released\r\nAristobulus from his bonds. He also committed two legions to him, and\r\nsent him in haste into Syria, as hoping that by his means he should\r\neasily conquer that country, and the parts adjoining to Judea. But envy\r\nprevented any effect of Aristobulus's alacrity, and the hopes of Caesar;\r\nfor he was taken off by poison given him by those of Pompey's party;\r\nand, for a long while, he had not so much as a burial vouchsafed him\r\nin his own country; but his dead body lay [above ground], preserved in\r\nhoney, until it was sent to the Jews by Antony, in order to be buried in\r\nthe royal sepulchers.\r\n\r\n2. His son Alexander also was beheaded by Scipio at Antioch, and that\r\nby the command of Pompey, and upon an accusation laid against him before\r\nhis tribunal, for the mischiefs he had done to the Romans. But Ptolemy,\r\nthe son of Menneus, who was then ruler of Chalcis, under Libanus, took\r\nhis brethren to him by sending his son Philippio for them to Ascalon,\r\nwho took Antigonus, as well as his sisters, away from Aristobulus's\r\nwife, and brought them to his father; and falling in love with the\r\nyounger daughter, he married her, and was afterwards slain by his father\r\non her account; for Ptolemy himself, after he had slain his son, married\r\nher, whose name was Alexandra; on the account of which marriage he took\r\nthe greater care of her brother and sister.\r\n\r\n3. Now, after Pompey was dead, Antipater changed sides, and cultivated\r\na friendship with Caesar. And since Mithridates of Pergamus, with\r\nthe forces he led against Egypt, was excluded from the avenues about\r\nPelusium, and was forced to stay at Asealon, he persuaded the Arabians,\r\namong whom he had lived, to assist him, and came himself to him, at the\r\nhead of three thousand armed men. He also encouraged the men of power in\r\nSyria to come to his assistance, as also of the inhabitants of Libanus,\r\nPtolemy, and Jamblicus, and another Ptolemy; by which means the cities\r\nof that country came readily into this war; insomuch that Mithridates\r\nventured now, in dependence upon the additional strength that he had\r\ngotten by Antipater, to march forward to Pelusium; and when they refused\r\nhim a passage through it, he besieged the city; in the attack of which\r\nplace Antipater principally signalized himself, for he brought down that\r\npart of the wall which was over against him, and leaped first of all\r\ninto the city, with the men that were about him.\r\n\r\n4. Thus was Pelusium taken. But still, as they were marching on, those\r\nEgyptian Jews that inhabited the country called the country of Onias\r\nstopped them. Then did Antipater not only persuade them not to stop\r\nthem, but to afford provisions for their army; on which account even\r\nthe people about Memphis would not fight against them, but of their\r\nown accord joined Mithridates. Whereupon he went round about Delta, and\r\nfought the rest of the Egyptians at a place called the Jews' Camp; nay,\r\nwhen he was in danger in the battle with all his right wing, Antipater\r\nwheeled about, and came along the bank of the river to him; for he\r\nhad beaten those that opposed him as he led the left wing. After which\r\nsuccess he fell upon those that pursued Mithridates, and slew a great\r\nmany of them, and pursued the remainder so far that he took their camp,\r\nwhile he lost no more than fourscore of his own men; as Mithridates\r\nlost, during the pursuit that was made after him, about eight hundred.\r\nHe was also himself saved unexpectedly, and became an unreproachable\r\nwitness to Caesar of the great actions of Antipater.\r\n\r\n5. Whereupon Caesar encouraged Antipater to undertake other hazardous\r\nenterprises for him, and that by giving him great commendations and\r\nhopes of reward. In all which enterprises he readily exposed himself to\r\nmany dangers, and became a most courageous warrior; and had many wounds\r\nalmost all over his body, as demonstrations of his valor. And when\r\nCaesar had settled the affairs of Egypt, and was returning into Syria\r\nagain, he gave him the privilege of a Roman citizen, and freedom from\r\ntaxes, and rendered him an object of admiration by the honors and marks\r\nof friendship he bestowed upon him. On this account it was that he also\r\nconfirmed Hyrcanus in the high priesthood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Caesar Makes Antipater Procurator Of Judea; As Does\r\n     Antipater Appoint Phasaelus To Be Governor Of Jerusalem, And\r\n     Herod Governor Of Galilee; Who, In Some Time, Was Called To\r\n     Answer For Himself [Before The Sanhedrim], Where He Is\r\n     Acquitted. Sextus Caesar Is Treacherously Killed By Bassus\r\n     And Is Succeeded By Marcus.\r\n\r\n1. About this time it was that Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus,\r\ncame to Caesar, and became, in a surprising manner, the occasion of\r\nAntipater's further advancement; for whereas he ought to have lamented\r\nthat his father appeared to have been poisoned on account of his\r\nquarrels with Pompey, and to have complained of Scipio's barbarity\r\ntowards his brother, and not to mix any invidious passion when he\r\nwas suing for mercy; besides those things, he came before Caesar, and\r\naccused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how they had driven him and his brethren\r\nentirely out of their native country, and had acted in a great many\r\ninstances unjustly and extravagantly with relation to their nation; and\r\nthat as to the assistance they had sent him into Egypt, it was not done\r\nout of good-will to him, but out of the fear they were in from former\r\nquarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to [his\r\nenemy] Pompey.\r\n\r\n2. Hereupon Antipater threw away his garments, and showed the multitude\r\nof the wounds he had, and said, that as to his good-will to Caesar, he\r\nhad no occasion to say a word, because his body cried aloud, though he\r\nsaid nothing himself; that he wondered at Antigonus's boldness, while\r\nhe was himself no other than the son of an enemy to the Romans, and of\r\na fugitive, and had it by inheritance from his father to be fond of\r\ninnovations and seditions, that he should undertake to accuse other\r\nmen before the Roman governor, and endeavor to gain some advantages to\r\nhimself, when he ought to be contented that he was suffered to live;\r\nfor that the reason of his desire of governing public affairs was not so\r\nmuch because he was in want of it, but because, if he could once obtain\r\nthe same, he might stir up a sedition among the Jews, and use what he\r\nshould gain from the Romans to the disservice of those that gave it him.\r\n\r\n3. When Caesar heard this, he declared Hyrcanus to be the most worthy\r\nof the high priesthood, and gave leave to Antipater to choose what\r\nauthority he pleased; but he left the determination of such dignity to\r\nhim that bestowed the dignity upon him; so he was constituted procurator\r\nof all Judea, and obtained leave, moreover, to rebuild 12 those walls of\r\nhis country that had been thrown down. These honorary grants Caesar sent\r\norders to have engraved in the Capitol, that they might stand there as\r\nindications of his own justice, and of the virtue of Antipater.\r\n\r\n4. But as soon as Antipater had conducted Caesar out of Syria he\r\nreturned to Judea, and the first thing he did was to rebuild that wall\r\nof his own country [Jerusalem] which Pompey had overthrown, and then to\r\ngo over the country, and to quiet the tumults that were therein; where\r\nhe partly threatened, and partly advised, every one, and told them\r\nthat in case they would submit to Hyrcanus, they would live happily and\r\npeaceably, and enjoy what they possessed, and that with universal peace\r\nand quietness; but that in case they hearkened to such as had some\r\nfrigid hopes by raising new troubles to get themselves some gain, they\r\nshould then find him to be their lord instead of their procurator; and\r\nfind Hyrcanus to be a tyrant instead of a king; and both the Romans and\r\nCaesar to be their enemies, instead of rulers; for that they would not\r\nsuffer him to be removed from the government, whom they had made their\r\ngovernor. And, at the same time that he said this, he settled the\r\naffairs of the country by himself, because he saw that Hyrcanus was\r\ninactive, and not fit to manage the affairs of the kingdom. So he\r\nconstituted his eldest son, Phasaelus, governor of Jerusalem, and of the\r\nparts about it; he also sent his next son, Herod, who was very young, 13\r\nwith equal authority into Galilee.\r\n\r\n5. Now Herod was an active man, and soon found proper materials for his\r\nactive spirit to work upon. As therefore he found that Hezekias, the\r\nhead of the robbers, ran over the neighboring parts of Syria with a\r\ngreat band of men, he caught him and slew him, and many more of the\r\nrobbers with him; which exploit was chiefly grateful to the Syrians,\r\ninsomuch that hymns were sung in Herod's commendation, both in the\r\nvillages and in the cities, as having procured their quietness, and\r\nhaving preserved what they possessed to them; on which occasion he\r\nbecame acquainted with Sextus Caesar, a kinsman of the great Caesar,\r\nand president of Syria. A just emulation of his glorious actions excited\r\nPhasaelus also to imitate him. Accordingly, he procured the good-will of\r\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem, by his own management of the city affairs,\r\nand did not abuse his power in any disagreeable manner; whence it came\r\nto pass that the nation paid Antipater the respects that were due only\r\nto a king, and the honors they all yielded him were equal to the honors\r\ndue to an absolute lord; yet did he not abate any part of that good-will\r\nor fidelity which he owed to Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n6. However, he found it impossible to escape envy in such his\r\nprosperity; for the glory of these young men affected even Hyrcanus\r\nhimself already privately, though he said nothing of it to any body; but\r\nwhat he principally was grieved at was the great actions of Herod, and\r\nthat so many messengers came one before another, and informed him of the\r\ngreat reputation he got in all his undertakings. There were also many\r\npeople in the royal palace itself who inflamed his envy at him; those, I\r\nmean, who were obstructed in their designs by the prudence either of\r\nthe young men, or of Antipater. These men said, that by committing the\r\npublic affairs to the management of Antipater and of his sons, he\r\nsat down with nothing but the bare name of a king, without any of its\r\nauthority; and they asked him how long he would so far mistake himself,\r\nas to breed up kings against his own interest; for that they did not now\r\nconceal their government of affairs any longer, but were plainly lords\r\nof the nation, and had thrust him out of his authority; that this was\r\nthe case when Herod slew so many men without his giving him any command\r\nto do it, either by word of mouth, or by his letter, and this in\r\ncontradiction to the law of the Jews; who therefore, in case he be not a\r\nking, but a private man, still ought to come to his trial, and answer it\r\nto him, and to the laws of his country, which do not permit any one to\r\nbe killed till he hath been condemned in judgment.\r\n\r\n7. Now Hyrcanus was, by degrees, inflamed with these discourses, and at\r\nlength could bear no longer, but he summoned Herod to take his trial.\r\nAccordingly, by his father's advice, and as soon as the affairs of\r\nGalilee would give him leave, he came up to [Jerusalem], when he had\r\nfirst placed garrisons in Galilee; however, he came with a sufficient\r\nbody of soldiers, so many indeed that he might not appear to have with\r\nhim an army able to overthrow Hyrcanus's government, nor yet so few as\r\nto expose him to the insults of those that envied him. However, Sextus\r\nCaesar was in fear for the young man, lest he should be taken by\r\nhis enemies, and brought to punishment; so he sent some to denounce\r\nexpressly to Hyrcanus that he should acquit Herod of the capital charge\r\nagainst him; who acquitted him accordingly, as being otherwise inclined\r\nalso so to do, for he loved Herod.\r\n\r\n8. But Herod, supposing that he had escaped punishment without the\r\nconsent of the king, retired to Sextus, to Damascus, and got every thing\r\nready, in order not to obey him if he should summon him again; whereupon\r\nthose that were evil-disposed irritated Hyrcanus, and told him that\r\nHerod was gone away in anger, and was prepared to make war upon him; and\r\nas the king believed what they said, he knew not what to do, since he\r\nsaw his antagonist was stronger than he was himself. And now, since\r\nHerod was made general of Coelesyria and Samaria by Sextus Caesar, he\r\nwas formidable, not only from the good-will which the nation bore him,\r\nbut by the power he himself had; insomuch that Hyrcanus fell into the\r\nutmost degree of terror, and expected he would presently march against\r\nhim with his army.\r\n\r\n9. Nor was he mistaken in the conjecture he made; for Herod got his army\r\ntogether, out of the anger he bare him for his threatening him with the\r\naccusation in a public court, and led it to Jerusalem, in order to throw\r\nHyrcanus down from his kingdom; and this he had soon done, unless his\r\nfather and brother had gone out together and broken the force of his\r\nfury, and this by exhorting him to carry his revenge no further than to\r\nthreatening and affrighting, but to spare the king, under whom he had\r\nbeen advanced to such a degree of power; and that he ought not to be so\r\nmuch provoked at his being tried, as to forget to be thankful that\r\nhe was acquitted; nor so long to think upon what was of a melancholy\r\nnature, as to be ungrateful for his deliverance; and if we ought to\r\nreckon that God is the arbitrator of success in war, an unjust cause\r\nis of more disadvantage than an army can be of advantage; and that\r\ntherefore he ought not to be entirely confident of success in a case\r\nwhere he is to fight against his king, his supporter, and one that had\r\noften been his benefactor, and that had never been severe to him, any\r\notherwise than as he had hearkened to evil counselors, and this no\r\nfurther than by bringing a shadow of injustice upon him. So Herod was\r\nprevailed upon by these arguments, and supposed that what he had already\r\ndone was sufficient for his future hopes, and that he had enough shown\r\nhis power to the nation.\r\n\r\n10. In the mean time, there was a disturbance among the Romans about\r\nApamia, and a civil war occasioned by the treacherous slaughter of\r\nSextus Caesar, by Cecilius Bassus, which he perpetrated out of his\r\ngood-will to Pompey; he also took the authority over his forces; but as\r\nthe rest of Caesar's commanders attacked Bassus with their whole army,\r\nin order to punish him for the murder of Caesar, Antipater also sent\r\nthem assistance by his sons, both on account of him that was murdered,\r\nand on account of that Caesar who was still alive, both of which were\r\ntheir friends; and as this war grew to be of a considerable length,\r\nMarcus came out of Italy as successor to Sextus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Herod Is Made Procurator Of All Syria; Malichus Is Afraid Of\r\n     Him, And Takes Antipater Off By Poison; Whereupon The\r\n     Tribunes Of The Soldiers Are Prevailed With To Kill Him.\r\n\r\n1. There, was at this time a mighty war raised among the Romans upon the\r\nsudden and treacherous slaughter of Caesar by Cassius and Brutus, after\r\nhe had held the government for three years and seven months. 14 Upon\r\nthis murder there were very great agitations, and the great men were\r\nmightily at difference one with another, and every one betook himself to\r\nthat party where they had the greatest hopes of their own, of advancing\r\nthemselves. Accordingly, Cassius came into Syria, in order to receive\r\nthe forces that were at Apamia, where he procured a reconciliation\r\nbetween Bassus and Marcus, and the legions which were at difference with\r\nhim; so he raised the siege of Apamia, and took upon him the command of\r\nthe army, and went about exacting tribute of the cities, and demanding\r\ntheir money to such a degree as they were not able to bear.\r\n\r\n2. So he gave command that the Jews should bring in seven hundred\r\ntalents; whereupon Antipater, out of his dread of Cassius's threats,\r\nparted the raising of this sum among his sons, and among others of his\r\nacquaintance, and to be done immediately; and among them he required\r\none Malichus, who was at enmity with him, to do his part also, which\r\nnecessity forced him to do. Now Herod, in the first place, mitigated the\r\npassion of Cassius, by bringing his share out of Galilee, which was a\r\nhundred talents, on which account he was in the highest favor with him;\r\nand when he reproached the rest for being tardy, he was angry at the\r\ncities themselves; so he made slaves of Gophna and Emmaus, and two\r\nothers of less note; nay, he proceeded as if he would kill Malichus,\r\nbecause he had not made greater haste in exacting his tribute; but\r\nAntipater prevented the ruin of this man, and of the other cities, and\r\ngot into Cassius's favor by bringing in a hundred talents immediately.\r\n15\r\n\r\n3. However, when Cassius was gone Malichus forgot the kindness that\r\nAntipater had done him, and laid frequent plots against him that\r\nhad saved him, as making haste to get him out of the way, who was an\r\nobstacle to his wicked practices; but Antipater was so much afraid of\r\nthe power and cunning of the man, that he went beyond Jordan, in order\r\nto get an army to guard himself against his treacherous designs; but\r\nwhen Malichus was caught in his plot, he put upon Antipater's sons by\r\nhis impudence, for he thoroughly deluded Phasaelus, who was the guardian\r\nof Jerusalem, and Herod who was intrusted with the weapons of war, and\r\nthis by a great many excuses and oaths, and persuaded them to procure\r\nhis reconciliation to his father. Thus was he preserved again by\r\nAntipater, who dissuaded Marcus, the then president of Syria, from\r\nhis resolution of killing Malichus, on account of his attempts for\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\n4. Upon the war between Cassius and Brutus on one side, against the\r\nyounger Caesar [Augustus] and Antony on the other, Cassius and Marcus\r\ngot together an army out of Syria; and because Herod was likely to have\r\na great share in providing necessaries, they then made him procurator of\r\nall Syria, and gave him an army of foot and horse. Cassius promised him\r\nalso, that after the war was over, he would make him king of Judea. But\r\nit so happened that the power and hopes of his son became the cause of\r\nhis perdition; for as Malichus was afraid of this, he corrupted one\r\nof the king's cup-bearers with money to give a poisoned potion to\r\nAntipater; so he became a sacrifice to Malichus's wickedness, and died\r\nat a feast. He was a man in other respects active in the management\r\nof affairs, and one that recovered the government to Hyrcanus, and\r\npreserved it in his hands.\r\n\r\n5. However, Malichus, when he was suspected of poisoning Antipater, and\r\nwhen the multitude was angry with him for it, denied it, and made the\r\npeople believe he was not guilty. He also prepared to make a greater\r\nfigure, and raised soldiers; for he did not suppose that Herod would\r\nbe quiet, who indeed came upon him with an army presently, in order to\r\nrevenge his father's death; but, upon hearing the advice of his brother\r\nPhasaelus, not to punish him in an open manner, lest the multitude\r\nshould fall into a sedition, he admitted of Malichus's apology, and\r\nprofessed that he cleared him of that suspicion; he also made a pompous\r\nfuneral for his father.\r\n\r\n6. So Herod went to Samaria, which was then in a tumult, and settled the\r\ncity in peace; after which at the [Pentecost] festival, he returned\r\nto Jerusalem, having his armed men with him: hereupon Hyrcanus, at the\r\nrequest of Malichus, who feared his reproach, forbade them to introduce\r\nforeigners to mix themselves with the people of the country while they\r\nwere purifying themselves; but Herod despised the pretense, and him that\r\ngave that command, and came in by night. Upon which Malithus came to\r\nhim, and bewailed Antipater; Herod also made him believe [he admitted\r\nof his lamentations as real], although he had much ado to restrain his\r\npassion at him; however, he did himself bewail the murder of his father\r\nin his letters to Cassius, who, on other accounts, also hated Malichus.\r\nCassius sent him word back that he should avenge his father's death upon\r\nhim, and privately gave order to the tribunes that were under him, that\r\nthey should assist Herod in a righteous action he was about.\r\n\r\n7. And because, upon the taking of Laodicea by Cassius, the men of power\r\nwere gotten together from all quarters, with presents and crowns in\r\ntheir hands, Herod allotted this time for the punishment of Malichus.\r\nWhen Malichus suspected that, and was at Tyre, he resolved to withdraw\r\nhis son privately from among the Tyrians, who was a hostage there, while\r\nhe got ready to fly away into Judea; the despair he was in of escaping\r\nexcited him to think of greater things; for he hoped that he should\r\nraise the nation to a revolt from the Romans, while Cassius was busy\r\nabout the war against Antony, and that he should easily depose Hyrcanus,\r\nand get the crown for himself.\r\n\r\n8. But fate laughed at the hopes he had; for Herod foresaw what he\r\nwas so zealous about, and invited both Hyrcanus and him to supper; but\r\ncalling one of the principal servants that stood by him to him, he\r\nsent him out, as though it were to get things ready for supper, but in\r\nreality to give notice beforehand about the plot that was laid against\r\nhim; accordingly they called to mind what orders Cassius had given\r\nthem, and went out of the city with their swords in their hands upon the\r\nsea-shore, where they encompassed Malichus round about, and killed him\r\nwith many wounds. Upon which Hyrcanus was immediately affrighted, till\r\nhe swooned away and fell down at the surprise he was in; and it was\r\nwith difficulty that he was recovered, when he asked who it was that had\r\nkilled Malichus. And when one of the tribunes replied that it was done\r\nby the command of Cassius, \"Then,\" said he, \"Cassius hath saved both me\r\nand my country, by cutting off one that was laying plots against them\r\nboth.\" Whether he spake according to his own sentiments, or whether his\r\nfear was such that he was obliged to commend the action by saying so,\r\nis uncertain; however, by this method Herod inflicted punishment upon\r\nMalichus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Phasaelus Is Too Hard For Felix; Herod Also Overcomes\r\n     Antigonus In Rattle; And The Jews Accuse Both Herod And\r\n     Phasaelus But Antonius Acquits Them, And Makes Them\r\n     Tetrarchs.\r\n\r\n1. When Cassius was gone out of Syria, another sedition arose at\r\nJerusalem, wherein Felix assaulted Phasaelus with an army, that he might\r\nrevenge the death of Malichus upon Herod, by falling upon his brother.\r\nNow Herod happened then to be with Fabius, the governor of Damascus,\r\nand as he was going to his brother's assistance, he was detained by\r\nsickness; in the mean time, Phasaelus was by himself too hard for Felix,\r\nand reproached Hyrcanus on account of his ingratitude, both for what\r\nassistance he had afforded Malichus, and for overlooking Malichus's\r\nbrother, when he possessed himself of the fortresses; for he had gotten\r\na great many of them already, and among them the strongest of them all,\r\nMasada.\r\n\r\n2. However, nothing could be sufficient for him against the force of\r\nHerod, who, as soon as he was recovered, took the other fortresses\r\nagain, and drove him out of Masada in the posture of a supplicant; he\r\nalso drove away Marion, the tyrant of the Tyrians, out of Galilee, when\r\nhe had already possessed himself of three fortified places; but as to\r\nthose Tyrians whom he had caught, he preserved them all alive; nay, some\r\nof them he gave presents to, and so sent them away, and thereby procured\r\ngood-will to himself from the city, and hatred to the tyrant. Marion had\r\nindeed obtained that tyrannical power of Cassius, who set tyrants\r\nover all Syria 16 and out of hatred to Herod it was that he assisted\r\nAntigonus, the son of Aristobulus, and principally on Fabius's account,\r\nwhom Antigonus had made his assistant by money, and had him accordingly\r\non his side when he made his descent; but it was Ptolemy, the kinsman of\r\nAntigonus, that supplied all that he wanted.\r\n\r\n3. When Herod had fought against these in the avenues of Judea, he\r\nwas conqueror in the battle, and drove away Antigonus, and returned to\r\nJerusalem, beloved by every body for the glorious action he had done;\r\nfor those who did not before favor him did join themselves to him now,\r\nbecause of his marriage into the family of Hyrcanus; for as he had\r\nformerly married a wife out of his own country of no ignoble blood,\r\nwho was called Doris, of whom he begat Antipater; so did he now marry\r\nMariamne, the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, and the\r\ngranddaughter of Hyrcanus, and was become thereby a relation of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n4. But when Caesar and Antony had slain Cassius near Philippi, and\r\nCaesar was gone to Italy, and Antony to Asia, amongst the rest of the\r\ncities which sent ambassadors to Antony unto Bithynia, the great men of\r\nthe Jews came also, and accused Phasaelus and Herod, that they kept the\r\ngovernment by force, and that Hyrcanus had no more than an honorable\r\nname. Herod appeared ready to answer this accusation; and having made\r\nAntony his friend by the large sums of money which he gave him, he\r\nbrought him to such a temper as not to hear the others speak against\r\nhim; and thus did they part at this time.\r\n\r\n5. However, after this, there came a hundred of the principal men among\r\nthe Jews to Daphne by Antioch to Antony, who was already in love with\r\nCleopatra to the degree of slavery; these Jews put those men that were\r\nthe most potent, both in dignity and eloquence, foremost, and accused\r\nthe brethren. 17 But Messala opposed them, and defended the brethren,\r\nand that while Hyrcanus stood by him, on account of his relation to\r\nthem. When Antony had heard both sides, he asked Hyrcanus which party\r\nwas the fittest to govern, who replied that Herod and his party were\r\nthe fittest. Antony was glad of that answer, for he had been formerly\r\ntreated in an hospitable and obliging manner by his father Antipater,\r\nwhen he marched into Judea with Gabinius; so he constituted the brethren\r\ntetrarchs, and committed to them the government of Judea.\r\n\r\n6. But when the ambassadors had indignation at this procedure, Antony\r\ntook fifteen of them, and put them into custody, whom he was also going\r\nto kill presently, and the rest he drove away with disgrace; on which\r\noccasion a still greater tumult arose at Jerusalem; so they sent again a\r\nthousand ambassadors to Tyre, where Antony now abode, as he was marching\r\nto Jerusalem; upon these men who made a clamor he sent out the governor\r\nof Tyre, and ordered him to punish all that he could catch of them, and\r\nto settle those in the administration whom he had made tetrarchs.\r\n\r\n7. But before this, Herod and Hyrcanus went out upon the sea-shore, and\r\nearnestly desired of these ambassadors that they would neither bring\r\nruin upon themselves, nor war upon their native country, by their rash\r\ncontentions; and when they grew still more outrageous, Antony sent out\r\narmed men, and slew a great many, and wounded more of them; of whom\r\nthose that were slain were buried by Hyrcanus, as were the wounded\r\nput under the care of physicians by him; yet would not those that\r\nhad escaped be quiet still, but put the affairs of the city into such\r\ndisorder, and so provoked Antony, that he slew those whom he had in\r\nbonds also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Parthians Bring Antigonus Back Into Judea, And Cast\r\n     Hyrcanus And Phasaelus Into Prison. The Flight Of Herod, And\r\n     The Taking Of Jerusalem And What Hyrcanus And Phasaelus\r\n     Suffered.\r\n\r\n1. Now two years afterward, when Barzapharnes, a governor among the\r\nParthians, and Paeorus, the king's son, had possessed themselves of\r\nSyria, and when Lysanias had already succeeded upon the death of his\r\nfather Ptolemy, the son of Menneus, in the government [of Chalcis], he\r\nprevailed with the governor, by a promise of a thousand talents, and\r\nfive hundred women, to bring back Antigonus to his kingdom, and to turn\r\nHyrcanus out of it. Pacorus was by these means induced so to do, and\r\nmarched along the sea-coast, while he ordered Barzapharnes to fall upon\r\nthe Jews as he went along the Mediterranean part of the country; but\r\nof the maritime people, the Tyrians would not receive Pacorus, although\r\nthose of Ptolemais and Sidon had received him; so he committed a troop\r\nof his horse to a certain cup-bearer belonging to the royal family,\r\nof his own name [Pacorus], and gave him orders to march into Judea, in\r\norder to learn the state of affairs among their enemies, and to help\r\nAntigonus when he should want his assistance.\r\n\r\n2. Now as these men were ravaging Carmel, many of the Jews ran together\r\nto Antigonus, and showed themselves ready to make an incursion into\r\nthe country; so he sent them before into that place called Drymus, [the\r\nwoodland 18 ] to seize upon the place; whereupon a battle was fought\r\nbetween them, and they drove the enemy away, and pursued them, and ran\r\nafter them as far as Jerusalem, and as their numbers increased, they\r\nproceeded as far as the king's palace; but as Hyrcanus and Phasaelus\r\nreceived them with a strong body of men, there happened a battle in the\r\nmarket-place, in which Herod's party beat the enemy, and shut them up\r\nin the temple, and set sixty men in the houses adjoining as a guard to\r\nthem. But the people that were tumultuous against the brethren came in,\r\nand burnt those men; while Herod, in his rage for killing them, attacked\r\nand slew many of the people, till one party made incursions on the other\r\nby turns, day by day, in the way of ambushes, and slaughters were made\r\ncontinually among them.\r\n\r\n3. Now when that festival which we call Pentecost was at hand, all the\r\nplaces about the temple, and the whole city, was full of a multitude of\r\npeople that were come out of the country, and which were the greatest\r\npart of them armed also, at which time Phasaelus guarded the wall, and\r\nHerod, with a few, guarded the royal palace; and when he made an assault\r\nupon his enemies, as they were out of their ranks, on the north quarter\r\nof the city, he slew a very great number of them, and put them all to\r\nflight; and some of them he shut up within the city, and others within\r\nthe outward rampart. In the mean time, Antigonus desired that Pacorus\r\nmight be admitted to be a reconciler between them; and Phasaelus was\r\nprevailed upon to admit the Parthian into the city with five hundred\r\nhorse, and to treat him in an hospitable manner, who pretended that he\r\ncame to quell the tumult, but in reality he came to assist Antigonus;\r\nhowever, he laid a plot for Phasaelus, and persuaded him to go as an\r\nambassador to Barzapharnes, in order to put an end to the war, although\r\nHerod was very earnest with him to the contrary, and exhorted him to\r\nkill the plotter, but not expose himself to the snares he had laid for\r\nhim, because the barbarians are naturally perfidious. However,\r\nPacorus went out and took Hyrcanus with him, that he might be the less\r\nsuspected; he also 19 left some of the horsemen, called the Freemen,\r\nwith Herod, and conducted Phasaelus with the rest.\r\n\r\n4. But now, when they were come to Galilee, they found that the people\r\nof that country had revolted, and were in arms, who came very cunningly\r\nto their leader, and besought him to conceal his treacherous intentions\r\nby an obliging behavior to them; accordingly, he at first made them\r\npresents; and afterward, as they went away, laid ambushes for them; and\r\nwhen they were come to one of the maritime cities called Ecdippon, they\r\nperceived that a plot was laid for them; for they were there informed\r\nof the promise of a thousand talents, and how Antigonus had devoted the\r\ngreatest number of the women that were there with them, among the five\r\nhundred, to the Parthians; they also perceived that an ambush was always\r\nlaid for them by the barbarians in the night time; they had also been\r\nseized on before this, unless they had waited for the seizure of Herod\r\nfirst at Jerusalem, because if he were once informed of this treachery\r\nof theirs, he would take care of himself; nor was this a mere report,\r\nbut they saw the guards already not far off them.\r\n\r\n5. Nor would Phasaelus think of forsaking Hyrcanus and flying away,\r\nalthough Ophellius earnestly persuaded him to it; for this man had\r\nlearned the whole scheme of the plot from Saramalla, the richest of\r\nall the Syrians. But Phasaelus went up to the Parfilian governor, and\r\nreproached him to his face for laying this treacherous plot against\r\nthem, and chiefly because he had done it for money; and he promised him\r\nthat he would give him more money for their preservation, than Antigonus\r\nhad promised to give for the kingdom. But the sly Parthian endeavored to\r\nremove all this suspicion by apologies and by oaths, and then went [to\r\nthe other] Pacorus; immediately after which those Parthians who were\r\nleft, and had it in charge, seized upon Phasaelus and Hyrcanus, who\r\ncould do no more than curse their perfidiousness and their perjury.\r\n\r\n6. In the mean time, the cup-bearer was sent [back], and laid a plot how\r\nto seize upon Herod, by deluding him, and getting him out of the city,\r\nas he was commanded to do. But Herod suspected the barbarians from the\r\nbeginning; and having then received intelligence that a messenger,\r\nwho was to bring him the letters that informed him of the treachery\r\nintended, had fallen among the enemy, he would not go out of the city;\r\nthough Pacorus said very positively that he ought to go out, and meet\r\nthe messengers that brought the letters, for that the enemy had not\r\ntaken them, and that the contents of them were not accounts of any plots\r\nupon them, but of what Phasaelus had done; yet had he heard from others\r\nthat his brother was seized; and Alexandra 20 the shrewdest woman in the\r\nworld, Hyrcanus's daughter, begged of him that he would not go out, nor\r\ntrust himself to those barbarians, who now were come to make an attempt\r\nupon him openly.\r\n\r\n7. Now as Pacorus and his friends were considering how they might bring\r\ntheir plot to bear privately, because it was not possible to circumvent\r\na man of so great prudence by openly attacking him, Herod prevented\r\nthem, and went off with the persons that were the most nearly related to\r\nhim by night, and this without their enemies being apprized of it. But\r\nas soon as the Parthians perceived it, they pursued after them; and as\r\nhe gave orders for his mother, and sister, and the young woman who was\r\nbetrothed to him, with her mother, and his youngest brother, to make the\r\nbest of their way, he himself, with his servants, took all the care they\r\ncould to keep off the barbarians; and when at every assault he had slain\r\na great many of them, he came to the strong hold of Masada.\r\n\r\n8. Nay, he found by experience that the Jews fell more heavily upon him\r\nthan did the Parthians, and created him troubles perpetually, and this\r\never since he was gotten sixty furlongs from the city; these sometimes\r\nbrought it to a sort of a regular battle. Now in the place where Herod\r\nbeat them, and killed a great number of them, there he afterward built\r\na citadel, in memory of the great actions he did there, and adorned it\r\nwith the most costly palaces, and erected very strong fortifications,\r\nand called it, from his own name, Herodium. Now as they were in their\r\nflight, many joined themselves to him every day; and at a place called\r\nThressa of Idumea his brother Joseph met him, and advised him to ease\r\nhimself of a great number of his followers, because Masada would not\r\ncontain so great a multitude, which were above nine thousand. Herod\r\ncomplied with this advice, and sent away the most cumbersome part of his\r\nretinue, that they might go into Idumea, and gave them provisions\r\nfor their journey; but he got safe to the fortress with his nearest\r\nrelations, and retained with him only the stoutest of his followers; and\r\nthere it was that he left eight hundred of his men as a guard for the\r\nwomen, and provisions sufficient for a siege; but he made haste himself\r\nto Petra of Arabia.\r\n\r\n9. As for the Parthians in Jerusalem, they betook themselves to\r\nplundering, and fell upon the houses of those that were fled, and upon\r\nthe king's palace, and spared nothing but Hyrcanus's money, which was\r\nnot above three hundred talents. They lighted on other men's money also,\r\nbut not so much as they hoped for; for Herod having a long while had\r\na suspicion of the perfidiousness of the barbarians, had taken care to\r\nhave what was most splendid among his treasures conveyed into Idumea,\r\nas every one belonging to him had in like manner done also. But the\r\nParthians proceeded to that degree of injustice, as to fill all the\r\ncountry with war without denouncing it, and to demolish the city\r\nMarissa, and not only to set up Antigonus for king, but to deliver\r\nPhasaelus and Hyrcanus bound into his hands, in order to their being\r\ntormented by him. Antigonus himself also bit off Hyrcanus's ears with\r\nhis own teeth, as he fell down upon his knees to him, that so he might\r\nnever be able upon any mutation of affairs to take the high priesthood\r\nagain, for the high priests that officiated were to be complete, and\r\nwithout blemish.\r\n\r\n10. However, he failed in his purpose of abusing Phasaelus, by reason of\r\nhis courage; for though he neither had the command of his sword nor of\r\nhis hands, he prevented all abuses by dashing his head against a stone;\r\nso he demonstrated himself to be Herod's own brother, and Hyrcanus a\r\nmost degenerate relation, and died with great bravery, and made the end\r\nof his life agreeable to the actions of it. There is also another\r\nreport about his end, viz. that he recovered of that stroke, and that\r\na surgeon, who was sent by Antigonus to heal him, filled the wound with\r\npoisonous ingredients, and so killed him; whichsoever of these deaths\r\nhe came to, the beginning of it was glorious. It is also reported that\r\nbefore he expired he was informed by a certain poor woman how Herod had\r\nescaped out of their hands, and that he said thereupon, \"I now die with\r\ncomfort, since I leave behind me one alive that will avenge me of mine\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\n11. This was the death of Phasaelus; but the Parthians, although they\r\nhad failed of the women they chiefly desired, yet did they put the\r\ngovernment of Jerusalem into the hands of Antigonus, and took away\r\nHyrcanus, and bound him, and carried him to Parthia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n     When Herod Is Rejected In Arabia, He Makes Haste To Rome\r\n     Where Antony And Caesar Join Their Interest To Make Him King\r\n .\r\n\r\n1. Now Herod did the more zealously pursue his journey into Arabia, as\r\nmaking haste to get money of the king, while his brother was yet alive;\r\nby which money alone it was that he hoped to prevail upon the covetous\r\ntemper of the barbarians to spare Phasaelus; for he reasoned thus with\r\nhimself:--that if the Arabian king was too forgetful of his father's\r\nfriendship with him, and was too covetous to make him a free gift, he\r\nwould however borrow of him as much as might redeem his brother, and\r\nput into his hands, as a pledge, the son of him that was to be redeemed.\r\nAccordingly he led his brother's son along with him, who was of the age\r\nof seven years. Now he was ready to give three hundred talents for his\r\nbrother, and intended to desire the intercession of the Tyrians, to get\r\nthem accepted; however, fate had been too quick for his diligence;\r\nand since Phasaelus was dead, Herod's brotherly love was now in vain.\r\nMoreover, he was not able to find any lasting friendship among the\r\nArabians; for their king, Malichus, sent to him immediately, and\r\ncommanded him to return back out of his country, and used the name of\r\nthe Parthians as a pretense for so doing, as though these had denounced\r\nto him by their ambassadors to cast Herod out of Arabia; while in\r\nreality they had a mind to keep back what they owed to Antipater, and\r\nnot be obliged to make requitals to his sons for the free gifts the\r\nfather had made them. He also took the impudent advice of those who,\r\nequally with himself, were willing to deprive Herod of what Antipater\r\nhad deposited among them; and these men were the most potent of all whom\r\nhe had in his kingdom.\r\n\r\n2. So when Herod had found that the Arabians were his enemies, and this\r\nfor those very reasons whence he hoped they would have been the most\r\nfriendly, and had given them such an answer as his passion suggested,\r\nhe returned back, and went for Egypt. Now he lodged the first evening at\r\none of the temples of that country, in order to meet with those whom he\r\nleft behind; but on the next day word was brought him, as he was going\r\nto Rhinocurura, that his brother was dead, and how he came by his death;\r\nand when he had lamented him as much as his present circumstances could\r\nbear, he soon laid aside such cares, and proceeded on his journey. But\r\nnow, after some time, the king of Arabia repented of what he had done,\r\nand sent presently away messengers to call him back: Herod had prevented\r\nthem, and was come to Pelusium, where he could not obtain a passage from\r\nthose that lay with the fleet, so he besought their captains to let him\r\ngo by them; accordingly, out of the reverence they bore to the fame and\r\ndignity of the man, they conducted him to Alexandria; and when he came\r\ninto the city, he was received by Cleopatra with great splendor,\r\nwho hoped he might be persuaded to be commander of her forces in the\r\nexpedition she was now about; but he rejected the queen's solicitations,\r\nand being neither afrighted at the height of that storm which then\r\nhappened, nor at the tumults that were now in Italy, he sailed for Rome.\r\n\r\n3. But as he was in peril about Pamphylia, and obliged to cast out\r\nthe greatest part of the ship's lading, he with difficulty got safe\r\nto Rhodes, a place which had been grievously harassed in the war with\r\nCassius. He was there received by his friends, Ptolemy and Sappinius;\r\nand although he was then in want of money, he fitted up a three-decked\r\nship of very great magnitude, wherein he and his friends sailed to\r\nBrundusium, 21 and went thence to Rome with all speed; where he first\r\nof all went to Antony, on account of the friendship his father had with\r\nhim, and laid before him the calamities of himself and his family; and\r\nthat he had left his nearest relations besieged in a fortress, and\r\nhad sailed to him through a storm, to make supplication to him for\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n4. Hereupon Antony was moved to compassion at the change that had been\r\nmade in Herod's affairs, and this both upon his calling to mind how\r\nhospitably he had been treated by Antipater, but more especially on\r\naccount of Herod's own virtue; so he then resolved to get him made king\r\nof the Jews, whom he had himself formerly made tetrarch. The contest\r\nalso that he had with Antigonus was another inducement, and that of no\r\nless weight than the great regard he had for Herod; for he looked upon\r\nAntigonus as a seditious person, and an enemy of the Romans; and as for\r\nCaesar, Herod found him better prepared than Antony, as remembering\r\nvery fresh the wars he had gone through together with his father, the\r\nhospitable treatment he had met with from him, and the entire good-will\r\nhe had showed to him; besides the activity which he saw in Herod\r\nhimself. So he called the senate together, wherein Messalas, and after\r\nhim Atratinus, produced Herod before them, and gave a full account of\r\nthe merits of his father, and his own good-will to the Romans. At the\r\nsame time they demonstrated that Antigonus was their enemy, not only\r\nbecause he soon quarreled with them, but because he now overlooked the\r\nRomans, and took the government by the means of the Parthians. These\r\nreasons greatly moved the senate; at which juncture Antony came in, and\r\ntold them that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod\r\nshould be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate\r\nwas separated, Antony and Caesar went out, with Herod between them;\r\nwhile the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in\r\norder to offer sacrifices, and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony\r\nalso made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Antigonus Besieges Those That Were In Masada, Whom Herod\r\n     Frees From Confinement When He Came Back From Rome, And\r\n     Presently Marches To Jerusalem Where He Finds Silo Corrupted\r\n     By Bribes.\r\n\r\n1. Now during this time Antigonus besieged those that were in Masada,\r\nwho had all other necessaries in sufficient quantity, but were in want\r\nof water; on which account Joseph, Herod's brother, was disposed to run\r\naway to the Arabians, with two hundred of his own friends, because he\r\nhad heard that Malichus repented of his offenses with regard to Herod;\r\nand he had been so quick as to have been gone out of the fortress\r\nalready, unless, on that very night when he was going away, there had\r\nfallen a great deal of rain, insomuch that his reservoirs were full of\r\nwater, and so he was under no necessity of running away. After which,\r\ntherefore, they made an irruption upon Antigonus's party, and slew a\r\ngreat many of them, some in open battles, and some in private ambush;\r\nnor had they always success in their attempts, for sometimes they were\r\nbeaten, and ran away.\r\n\r\n2. In the mean time Ventidius, the Roman general, was sent out of Syria,\r\nto restrain the incursions of the Parthians; and after he had done that,\r\nhe came into Judea, in pretense indeed to assist Joseph and his party,\r\nbut in reality to get money of Antigonus; and when he had pitched his\r\ncamp very near to Jerusalem, as soon as he had got money enough, he went\r\naway with the greatest part of his forces; yet still did he leave Silo\r\nwith some part of them, lest if he had taken them all away, his taking\r\nof bribes might have been too openly discovered. Now Antigonus hoped\r\nthat the Parthians would come again to his assistance, and therefore\r\ncultivated a good understanding with Silo in the mean time, lest any\r\ninterruption should be given to his hopes.\r\n\r\n3. Now by this time Herod had sailed out of Italy, and was come to\r\nPtolemais; and as soon as he had gotten together no small army of\r\nforeigners, and of his own countrymen, he marched through Galilee\r\nagainst Antigonus, wherein he was assisted by Ventidius and Silo, both\r\nwhom Dellius, 22 a person sent by Antony, persuaded to bring Herod\r\n[into his kingdom]. Now Ventidius was at this time among the cities, and\r\ncomposing the disturbances which had happened by means of the Parthians,\r\nas was Silo in Judea corrupted by the bribes that Antigonus had given\r\nhim; yet was not Herod himself destitute of power, but the number of his\r\nforces increased every day as he went along, and all Galilee, with few\r\nexceptions, joined themselves to him. So he proposed to himself to set\r\nabout his most necessary enterprise, and that was Masada, in order to\r\ndeliver his relations from the siege they endured. But still Joppa stood\r\nin his way, and hindered his going thither; for it was necessary to take\r\nthat city first, which was in the enemies' hands, that when he should\r\ngo to Jerusalem, no fortress might be left in the enemies' power behind\r\nhim. Silo also willingly joined him, as having now a plausible occasion\r\nof drawing off his forces [from Jerusalem]; and when the Jews pursued\r\nhim, and pressed upon him, [in his retreat,] Herod made all excursion\r\nupon them with a small body of his men, and soon put them to flight, and\r\nsaved Silo when he was in distress.\r\n\r\n4. After this Herod took Joppa, and then made haste to Masada to free\r\nhis relations. Now, as he was marching, many came in to him, induced by\r\ntheir friendship to his father, some by the reputation he had already\r\ngained himself, and some in order to repay the benefits they had\r\nreceived from them both; but still what engaged the greatest number on\r\nhis side, was the hopes from him when he should be established in his\r\nkingdom; so that he had gotten together already an army hard to be\r\nconquered. But Antigonus laid an ambush for him as he marched out,\r\nin which he did little or no harm to his enemies. However, he easily\r\nrecovered his relations again that were in Masada, as well as the\r\nfortress Ressa, and then marched to Jerusalem, where the soldiers that\r\nwere with Silo joined themselves to his own, as did many out of the\r\ncity, from a dread of his power.\r\n\r\n5. Now when he had pitched his camp on the west side of the city, the\r\nguards that were there shot their arrows and threw their darts at them,\r\nwhile others ran out in companies, and attacked those in the forefront;\r\nbut Herod commanded proclamation to be made at the wall, that he was\r\ncome for the good of the people and the preservation of the city,\r\nwithout any design to be revenged on his open enemies, but to grant\r\noblivion to them, though they had been the most obstinate against him.\r\nNow the soldiers that were for Antigonus made a contrary clamor, and did\r\nneither permit any body to hear that proclamation, nor to change their\r\nparty; so Antigonus gave order to his forces to beat the enemy from the\r\nwalls; accordingly, they soon threw their darts at them from the towers,\r\nand put them to flight.\r\n\r\n6. And here it was that Silo discovered he had taken bribes; for he set\r\nmany of the soldiers to clamor about their want of necessaries, and to\r\nrequire their pay, in order to buy themselves food, and to demand that\r\nhe would lead them into places convenient for their winter quarters;\r\nbecause all the parts about the city were laid waste by the means of\r\nAntigonus's army, which had taken all things away. By this he moved the\r\narmy, and attempted to get them off the siege; but Herod went to the\r\ncaptains that were under Silo, and to a great many of the soldiers, and\r\nbegged of them not to leave him, who was sent thither by Caesar, and\r\nAntony, and the senate; for that he would take care to have their wants\r\nsupplied that very day. After the making of which entreaty, he went\r\nhastily into the country, and brought thither so great an abundance\r\nof necessaries, that he cut off all Silo's pretenses; and in order to\r\nprovide that for the following days they should not want supplies, he\r\nsent to the people that were about Samaria [which city had joined itself\r\nto him] to bring corn, and wine, and oil, and cattle to Jericho. When\r\nAntigonus heard of this, he sent some of his party with orders to\r\nhinder, and lay ambushes for these collectors of corn. This command was\r\nobeyed, and a great multitude of armed men were gathered together about\r\nJericho, and lay upon the mountains, to watch those that brought the\r\nprovisions. Yet was Herod not idle, but took with him ten cohorts, five\r\nof them were Romans, and five were Jewish cohorts, together with\r\nsome mercenary troops intermixed among them, and besides those a few\r\nhorsemen, and came to Jericho; and when he came, he found the city\r\ndeserted, but that there were five hundred men, with their wives and\r\nchildren, who had taken possession of the tops of the mountains; these\r\nhe took, and dismissed them, while the Romans fell upon the rest of the\r\ncity, and plundered it, having found the houses full of all sorts of\r\ngood things. So the king left a garrison at Jericho, and came back, and\r\nsent the Roman army into those cities which were come over to him, to\r\ntake their winter quarters there, viz. into Judea, [or Idumea,] and\r\nGalilee, and Samaria. Antigonus also by bribes obtained of Silo to let a\r\npart of his army be received at Lydda, as a compliment to Antonius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Herod Takes Sepphoris And Subdues The Robbers That Were In\r\n     The Caves; He After That Avenges Himself Upon Machaerus, As\r\n     Upon An Enemy Of His And Goes To Antony As He Was Besieging\r\n     Samosata.\r\n\r\n1. So the Romans lived in plenty of all things, and rested from war.\r\nHowever, Herod did not lie at rest, but seized upon Idumea, and kept it,\r\nwith two thousand footmen, and four hundred horsemen; and this he did by\r\nsending his brother Joseph thither, that no innovation might be made by\r\nAntigonus. He also removed his mother, and all his relations, who had\r\nbeen in Masada, to Samaria; and when he had settled them securely, he\r\nmarched to take the remaining parts of Galilee, and to drive away the\r\ngarrisons placed there by Antigonus.\r\n\r\n2. But when Herod had reached Sepphoris, 23 in a very great snow, he\r\ntook the city without any difficulty; the guards that should have kept\r\nit flying away before it was assaulted; where he gave an opportunity\r\nto his followers that had been in distress to refresh themselves, there\r\nbeing in that city a great abundance of necessaries. After which he\r\nhasted away to the robbers that were in the caves, who overran a great\r\npart of the country, and did as great mischief to its inhabitants as\r\na war itself could have done. Accordingly, he sent beforehand three\r\ncohorts of footmen, and one troop of horsemen, to the village Arbela,\r\nand came himself forty days afterwards 24 with the rest of his forces\r\nYet were not the enemy affrighted at his assault but met him in arms;\r\nfor their skill was that of warriors, but their boldness was the\r\nboldness of robbers: when therefore it came to a pitched battle,\r\nthey put to flight Herod's left wing with their right one; but Herod,\r\nwheeling about on the sudden from his own right wing, came to their\r\nassistance, and both made his own left wing return back from its flight,\r\nand fell upon the pursuers, and cooled their courage, till they could\r\nnot bear the attempts that were made directly upon them, and so turned\r\nback and ran away. 3. But Herod followed them, and slew them as he\r\nfollowed them, and destroyed a great part of them, till those that\r\nremained were scattered beyond the river [Jordan;] and Galilee was\r\nfreed from the terrors they had been under, excepting from those that\r\nremained, and lay concealed in caves, which required longer time ere\r\nthey could be conquered. In order to which Herod, in the first place,\r\ndistributed the fruits of their former labors to the soldiers, and gave\r\nevery one of them a hundred and fifty drachmae of silver, and a great\r\ndeal more to their commanders, and sent them into their winter quarters.\r\nHe also sent to his youngest brother Pheroas, to take care of a good\r\nmarket for them, where they might buy themselves provisions, and to\r\nbuild a wall about Alexandrium; who took care of both those injunctions\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n4. In the mean time Antony abode at Athens, while Ventidius called for\r\nSilo and Herod to come to the war against the Parthians, but ordered\r\nthem first to settle the affairs of Judea; so Herod willingly dismissed\r\nSilo to go to Ventidius, but he made an expedition himself against those\r\nthat lay in the caves. Now these caves were in the precipices of craggy\r\nmountains, and could not be come at from any side, since they had only\r\nsome winding pathways, very narrow, by which they got up to them; but\r\nthe rock that lay on their front had beneath it valleys of a vast depth,\r\nand of an almost perpendicular declivity; insomuch that the king\r\nwas doubtful for a long time what to do, by reason of a kind of\r\nimpossibility there was of attacking the place. Yet did he at length\r\nmake use of a contrivance that was subject to the utmost hazard; for he\r\nlet down the most hardy of his men in chests, and set them at the mouths\r\nof the dens. Now these men slew the robbers and their families, and when\r\nthey made resistance, they sent in fire upon them [and burnt them]; and\r\nas Herod was desirous of saving some of them, he had proclamation made,\r\nthat they should come and deliver themselves up to him; but not one of\r\nthem came willingly to him; and of those that were compelled to come,\r\nmany preferred death to captivity. And here a certain old man, the\r\nfather of seven children, whose children, together with their mother,\r\ndesired him to give them leave to go out, upon the assurance and right\r\nhand that was offered them, slew them after the following manner: He\r\nordered every one of them to go out, while he stood himself at the\r\ncave's mouth, and slew that son of his perpetually who went out. Herod\r\nwas near enough to see this sight, and his bowels of compassion were\r\nmoved at it, and he stretched out his right hand to the old man, and\r\nbesought him to spare his children; yet did not he relent at all upon\r\nwhat he said, but over and above reproached Herod on the lowness of\r\nhis descent, and slew his wife as well as his children; and when he had\r\nthrown their dead bodies down the precipice, he at last threw himself\r\ndown after them.\r\n\r\n5. By this means Herod subdued these caves, and the robbers that were\r\nin them. He then left there a part of his army, as many as he thought\r\nsufficient to prevent any sedition, and made Ptolemy their general, and\r\nreturned to Samaria; he led also with him three thousand armed footmen,\r\nand six hundred horsemen, against Antigonus. Now here those that used\r\nto raise tumults in Galilee, having liberty so to do upon his departure,\r\nfell unexpectedly upon Ptolemy, the general of his forces, and slew him;\r\nthey also laid the country waste, and then retired to the bogs, and\r\nto places not easily to be found. But when Herod was informed of this\r\ninsurrection, he came to the assistance of the country immediately, and\r\ndestroyed a great number of the seditions, and raised the sieges of all\r\nthose fortresses they had besieged; he also exacted the tribute of a\r\nhundred talents of his enemies, as a penalty for the mutations they had\r\nmade in the country.\r\n\r\n6. By this time [the Parthians being already driven out of the country,\r\nand Pacorus slain] Ventidius, by Antony's command, sent a thousand\r\nhorsemen, and two legions, as auxiliaries to Herod, against Antigonus.\r\nNow Antigonus besought Machaerus, who was their general, by letter, to\r\ncome to his assistance, and made a great many mournful complaints about\r\nHerod's violence, and about the injuries he did to the kingdom; and\r\npromised to give him money for such his assistance; but he complied not\r\nwith his invitation to betray his trust, for he did not contemn him that\r\nsent him, especially while Herod gave him more money [than the other\r\noffered]. So he pretended friendship to Antigonus, but came as a spy to\r\ndiscover his affairs; although he did not herein comply with Herod, who\r\ndissuaded him from so doing. But Antigonus perceived what his intentions\r\nwere beforehand, and excluded him out of the city, and defended himself\r\nagainst him as against an enemy, from the walls; till Machaerus was\r\nashamed of what he had done, and retired to Emmaus to Herod; and as he\r\nwas in a rage at his disappointment, he slew all the Jews whom he met\r\nwith, without sparing those that were for Herod, but using them all as\r\nif they were for Antigonus.\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon Herod was very angry at him, and was going to fight against\r\nMachaerus as his enemy; but he restrained his indignation, and marched\r\nto Antony to accuse Machaerus of maladministration. But Machaerus was\r\nmade sensible of his offenses, and followed after the king immediately,\r\nand earnestly begged and obtained that he would be reconciled to him.\r\nHowever, Herod did not desist from his resolution of going to Antony;\r\nbut when he heard that he was besieging Samosata 25 with a great army,\r\nwhich is a strong city near to Euphrates, he made the greater haste;\r\nas observing that this was a proper opportunity for showing at once his\r\ncourage, and for doing what would greatly oblige Antony. Indeed, when he\r\ncame, he soon made an end of that siege, and slew a great number of the\r\nbarbarians, and took from them a large prey; insomuch that Antony, who\r\nadmired his courage formerly, did now admire it still more. Accordingly,\r\nhe heaped many more honors upon him, and gave him more assured hopes\r\nthat he should gain his kingdom; and now king Antiochus was forced to\r\ndeliver up Samosata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Death Of Joseph [Herod's Brother] Which Had Been\r\n     Signified To Herod In Dreams. How Herod Was Preserved Twice\r\n     After A Wonderful Manner. He Cuts Off The Head Of Pappus,\r\n     Who Was The Murderer Of His Brother And Sends That Head To\r\n     [His Other Brother] Pheroras, And In No Long Time He\r\n     Besieges Jerusalem And Marries Mariamne.\r\n\r\n1. In the mean time, Herod's affairs in Judea were in an ill state. He\r\nhad left his brother Joseph with full power, but had charged him to make\r\nno attempts against Antigonus till his return; for that Machaerus would\r\nnot be such an assistant as he could depend on, as it appeared by what\r\nhe had done already; but as soon as Joseph heard that his brother was\r\nat a very great distance, he neglected the charge he had received, and\r\nmarched towards Jericho with five cohorts, which Machaerus sent with\r\nhim. This movement was intended for seizing on the corn, as it was\r\nnow in the midst of summer; but when his enemies attacked him in the\r\nmountains, and in places which were difficult to pass, he was both\r\nkilled himself, as he was very bravely fighting in the battle, and the\r\nentire Roman cohorts were destroyed; for these cohorts were new-raised\r\nmen, gathered out of Syria, and here was no mixture of those called\r\nveteran soldiers among them, who might have supported those that were\r\nunskillful in war.\r\n\r\n2. This victory was not sufficient for Antigonus; but he proceeded to\r\nthat degree of rage, as to treat the dead body of Joseph barbarously;\r\nfor when he had got possession of the bodies of those that were slain,\r\nhe cut off his head, although his brother Pheroras would have given\r\nfifty talents as a price of redemption for it. And now the affairs of\r\nGalilee were put in such disorder after this victory of Antigonus's,\r\nthat those of Antigonus's party brought the principal men that were\r\non Herod's side to the lake, and there drowned them. There was a great\r\nchange made also in Idumea, where Machaerus was building a wall about\r\none of the fortresses, which was called Gittha. But Herod had not yet\r\nbeen informed of these things; for after the taking of Samosata, and\r\nwhen Antony had set Sosius over the affairs of Syria, and had given him\r\norders to assist Herod against Antigonus, he departed into Egypt; but\r\nSosius sent two legions before him into Judea to assist Herod, and\r\nfollowed himself soon after with the rest of his army.\r\n\r\n3. Now when Herod was at Daphne, by Antioch, he had some dreams which\r\nclearly foreboded his brother's death; and as he leaped out of his bed\r\nin a disturbed manner, there came messengers that acquainted him with\r\nthat calamity. So when he had lamented this misfortune for a while, he\r\nput off the main part of his mourning, and made haste to march against\r\nhis enemies; and when he had performed a march that was above his\r\nstrength, and was gone as far as Libanus, he got him eight hundred men\r\nof those that lived near to that mountain as his assistants, and joined\r\nwith them one Roman legion, with which, before it was day, he made an\r\nirruption into Galilee, and met his enemies, and drove them back to\r\nthe place which they had left. He also made an immediate and continual\r\nattack upon the fortress. Yet was he forced by a most terrible storm to\r\npitch his camp in the neighboring villages before he could take it. But\r\nwhen, after a few days' time, the second legion, that came from Antony,\r\njoined themselves to him, the enemy were affrighted at his power, and\r\nleft their fortifications in the night time.\r\n\r\n4. After this he marched through Jericho, as making what haste he\r\ncould to be avenged on his brother's murderers; where happened to him\r\na providential sign, out of which, when he had unexpectedly escaped,\r\nhe had the reputation of being very dear to God; for that evening there\r\nfeasted with him many of the principal men; and after that feast was\r\nover, and all the guests were gone out, the house fell down immediately.\r\nAnd as he judged this to be a common signal of what dangers he should\r\nundergo, and how he should escape them in the war that he was going\r\nabout, he, in the morning, set forward with his army, when about six\r\nthousand of his enemies came running down from the mountains, and began\r\nto fight with those in his forefront; yet durst they not be so very bold\r\nas to engage the Romans hand to hand, but threw stones and darts at them\r\nat a distance; by which means they wounded a considerable number; in\r\nwhich action Herod's own side was wounded with a dart.\r\n\r\n5. Now as Antigonus had a mind to appear to exceed Herod, not only in\r\nthe courage, but in the number of his men, he sent Pappus, one of his\r\ncompanions, with an army against Samaria, whose fortune it was to oppose\r\nMachaerus; but Herod overran the enemy's country, and demolished five\r\nlittle cities, and destroyed two thousand men that were in them,\r\nand burned their houses, and then returned to his camp; but his\r\nhead-quarters were at the village called Cana.\r\n\r\n6. Now a great multitude of Jews resorted to him every day, both out of\r\nJericho and the other parts of the country. Some were moved so to do\r\nout of their hatred to Antigonus, and some out of regard to the glorious\r\nactions Herod had done; but others were led on by an unreasonable desire\r\nof change; so he fell upon them immediately. As for Pappus and his\r\nparty, they were not terrified either at their number or at their zeal,\r\nbut marched out with great alacrity to fight them; and it came to a\r\nclose fight. Now other parts of their army made resistance for a while;\r\nbut Herod, running the utmost hazard, out of the rage he was in at the\r\nmurder of his brother, that he might be avenged on those that had been\r\nthe authors of it, soon beat those that opposed him; and after he had\r\nbeaten them, he always turned his force against those that stood to it\r\nstill, and pursued them all; so that a great slaughter was made, while\r\nsome were forced back into that village whence they came out; he also\r\npressed hard upon the hindermost, and slew a vast number of them; he\r\nalso fell into the village with the enemy, where every house was filled\r\nwith armed men, and the upper rooms were crowded above with soldiers for\r\ntheir defense; and when he had beaten those that were on the outside,\r\nhe pulled the houses to pieces, and plucked out those that were within;\r\nupon many he had the roofs shaken down, whereby they perished by heaps;\r\nand as for those that fled out of the ruins, the soldiers received them\r\nwith their swords in their hands; and the multitude of those slain and\r\nlying on heaps was so great, that the conquerors could not pass along\r\nthe roads. Now the enemy could not bear this blow, so that when the\r\nmultitude of them which was gathered together saw that those in the\r\nvillage were slain, they dispersed themselves, and fled away; upon the\r\nconfidence of which victory, Herod had marched immediately to Jerusalem,\r\nunless he tad been hindered by the depth of winter's [coming on]. This\r\nwas the impediment that lay in the way of this his entire glorious\r\nprogress, and was what hindered Antigonus from being now conquered, who\r\nwas already disposed to forsake the city.\r\n\r\n7. Now when at the evening Herod had already dismissed his friends to\r\nrefresh themselves after their fatigue, and when he was gone himself,\r\nwhile he was still hot in his armor, like a common soldier, to bathe\r\nhimself, and had but one servant that attended him, and before he was\r\ngotten into the bath, one of the enemies met him in the face with a\r\nsword in his hand, and then a second, and then a third, and after that\r\nmore of them; these were men who had run away out of the battle into\r\nthe bath in their armor, and they had lain there for some time in, great\r\nterror, and in privacy; and when they saw the king, they trembled for\r\nfear, and ran by him in a flight, although he was naked, and endeavored\r\nto get off into the public road. Now there was by chance nobody else at\r\nhand that might seize upon these men; and for Herod, he was contented to\r\nhave come to no harm himself, so that they all got away in safety.\r\n\r\n8. But on the next day Herod had Pappus's head cut off, who was the\r\ngeneral for Antigonus, and was slain in the battle, and sent it to his\r\nbrother Pheroras, by way of punishment for their slain brother; for he\r\nwas the man that slew Joseph. Now as winter was going off, Herod marched\r\nto Jerusalem, and brought his army to the wall of it; this was the third\r\nyear since he had been made king at Rome; so he pitched his camp before\r\nthe temple, for on that side it might be besieged, and there it was\r\nthat Pompey took the city. So he parted the work among the army, and\r\ndemolished the suburbs, end raised three banks, and gave orders to\r\nhave towers built upon those banks, and left the most laborious of his\r\nacquaintance at the works. But he went himself to Samaria, to take the\r\ndaughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, to wife, who had\r\nbeen betrothed to him before, as we have already said; and thus he\r\naccomplished this by the by, during the siege of the city, for he had\r\nhis enemies in great contempt already.\r\n\r\n9. When he had thus married Mariamne, he came back to Jerusalem with a\r\ngreater army. Sosius also joined him with a large army, both of horsemen\r\nand footmen, which he sent before him through the midland parts, while\r\nhe marched himself along Phoenicia; and when the whole army was gotten\r\ntogether, which were eleven regiments of footmen, and six thousand\r\nhorsemen, besides the Syrian auxiliaries, which were no small part\r\nof the army, they pitched their camp near to the north wall. Herod's\r\ndependence was upon the decree of the senate, by which he was made king;\r\nand Sosius relied upon Antony, who sent the army that was under him to\r\nHerod's assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Herod And Sosius Took Jerusalem By Force; And What Death\r\n     Antigonus Came To. Also Concerning Cleopatra's Avaricious\r\n     Temper.\r\n\r\n1. Now the multitude of the Jews that were in the city were divided into\r\nseveral factions; for the people that crowded about the temple, being\r\nthe weaker part of them, gave it out that, as the times were, he was the\r\nhappiest and most religious man who should die first. But as to the\r\nmore bold and hardy men, they got together in bodies, and fell a robbing\r\nothers after various manners, and these particularly plundered the\r\nplaces that were about the city, and this because there was no food left\r\neither for the horses or the men; yet some of the warlike men, who were\r\nused to fight regularly, were appointed to defend the city during the\r\nsiege, and these drove those that raised the banks away from the\r\nwall; and these were always inventing some engine or another to be a\r\nhinderance to the engines of the enemy; nor had they so much success any\r\nway as in the mines under ground.\r\n\r\n2. Now as for the robberies which were committed, the king contrived\r\nthat ambushes should be so laid, that they might restrain their\r\nexcursions; and as for the want of provisions, he provided that they\r\nshould be brought to them from great distances. He was also too hard\r\nfor the Jews, by the Romans' skill in the art of war; although they were\r\nbold to the utmost degree, now they durst not come to a plain battle\r\nwith the Romans, which was certain death; but through their mines under\r\nground they would appear in the midst of them on the sudden, and before\r\nthey could batter down one wall, they built them another in its\r\nstead; and to sum up all at once, they did not show any want either of\r\npainstaking or of contrivances, as having resolved to hold out to the\r\nvery last. Indeed, though they had so great an army lying round about\r\nthem, they bore a siege of five months, till some of Herod's chosen men\r\nventured to get upon the wall, and fell into the city, as did Sosius's\r\ncenturions after them; and now they first of all seized upon what\r\nwas about the temple; and upon the pouring in of the army, there was\r\nslaughter of vast multitudes every where, by reason of the rage the\r\nRomans were in at the length of this siege, and by reason that the Jews\r\nwho were about Herod earnestly endeavored that none of their adversaries\r\nmight remain; so they were cut to pieces by great multitudes, as they\r\nwere crowded together in narrow streets, and in houses, or were running\r\naway to the temple; nor was there any mercy showed either to infants, or\r\nto the aged, or to the weaker sex; insomuch that although the king sent\r\nabout and desired them to spare the people, nobody could be persuaded\r\nto withhold their right hand from slaughter, but they slew people of all\r\nages, like madmen. Then it was that Antigonus, without any regard to his\r\nformer or to his present fortune, came down from the citadel, and fell\r\nat Sosius's feet, who without pitying him at all, upon the change of his\r\ncondition, laughed at him beyond measure, and called him Antigona. 26\r\nYet did he not treat him like a woman, or let him go free, but put him\r\ninto bonds, and kept him in custody.\r\n\r\n3. But Herod's concern at present, now he had gotten his enemies under\r\nhis power, was to restrain the zeal of his foreign auxiliaries; for the\r\nmultitude of the strange people were very eager to see the temple, and\r\nwhat was sacred in the holy house itself; but the king endeavored to\r\nrestrain them, partly by his exhortations, partly by his threatenings,\r\nnay, partly by force, as thinking the victory worse than a defeat to\r\nhim, if any thing that ought not to be seen were seen by them. He also\r\nforbade, at the same time, the spoiling of the city, asking Sosius in\r\nthe most earnest manner, whether the Romans, by thus emptying the city\r\nof money and men, had a mind to leave him king of a desert,--and told\r\nhim that he judged the dominion of the habitable earth too small a\r\ncompensation for the slaughter of so many citizens. And when Sosius said\r\nthat it was but just to allow the soldiers this plunder as a reward for\r\nwhat they suffered during the siege, Herod made answer, that he would\r\ngive every one of the soldiers a reward out of his own money. So he\r\npurchased the deliverance of his country, and performed his promises to\r\nthem, and made presents after a magnificent manner to each soldier,\r\nand proportionably to their commanders, and with a most royal bounty\r\nto Sosius himself, whereby nobody went away but in a wealthy condition.\r\nHereupon Sosius dedicated a crown of gold to God, and then went away\r\nfrom Jerusalem, leading Antigonus away in bonds to Antony; then did the\r\naxe bring him to his end, 27 who still had a fond desire of life, and\r\nsome frigid hopes of it to the last, but by his cowardly behavior well\r\ndeserved to die by it.\r\n\r\n4. Hereupon king Herod distinguished the multitude that was in the city;\r\nand for those that were of his side, he made them still more his friends\r\nby the honors he conferred on them; but for those of Antigonus's party,\r\nhe slew them; and as his money ran low, he turned all the ornaments he\r\nhad into money, and sent it to Antony, and to those about him. Yet could\r\nhe not hereby purchase an exemption from all sufferings; for Antony was\r\nnow bewitched by his love to Cleopatra, and was entirely conquered by\r\nher charms. Now Cleopatra had put to death all her kindred, till no\r\none near her in blood remained alive, and after that she fell a slaying\r\nthose no way related to her. So she calumniated the principal men among\r\nthe Syrians to Antony, and persuaded him to have them slain, that so she\r\nmight easily gain to be mistress of what they had; nay, she extended her\r\navaricious humor to the Jews and Arabians, and secretly labored to have\r\nHerod and Malichus, the kings of both those nations, slain by his order.\r\n\r\n5. Now is to these her injunctions to Antony, he complied in part; for\r\nthough he esteemed it too abominable a thing to kill such good and great\r\nkings, yet was he thereby alienated from the friendship he had for\r\nthem. He also took away a great deal of their country; nay, even the\r\nplantation of palm trees at Jericho, where also grows the balsam tree,\r\nand bestowed them upon her; as also all the cities on this side the\r\nriver Eleutherus, Tyre and Sidon 28 excepted. And when she was become\r\nmistress of these, and had conducted Antony in his expedition against\r\nthe Parthians as far as Euphrates, she came by Apamia and Damascus\r\ninto Judea and there did Herod pacify her indignation at him by large\r\npresents. He also hired of her those places that had been torn away from\r\nhis kingdom, at the yearly rent of two hundred talents. He conducted her\r\nalso as far as Pelusium, and paid her all the respects possible. Now it\r\nwas not long after this that Antony was come back from Parthia, and led\r\nwith him Artabazes, Tigranes's son, captive, as a present for Cleopatra;\r\nfor this Parthian was presently given her, with his money, and all the\r\nprey that was taken with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Antony At The Persuasion Of Cleopatra Sent Herod To\r\n     Fight Against The Arabians; And Now After Several Battles,\r\n     He At Length Got The Victory. As Also Concerning A Great\r\n     Earthquake.\r\n\r\n1. Now when the war about Actium was begun, Herod prepared to come to\r\nthe assistance of Antony, as being already freed from his troubles in\r\nJudea, and having gained Hyrcania, which was a place that was held by\r\nAntigonus's sister. However, he was cunningly hindered from partaking of\r\nthe hazards that Antony went through by Cleopatra; for since, as we\r\nhave already noted, she had laid a plot against the kings [of Judea\r\nand Arabia], she prevailed with Antony to commit the war against the\r\nArabians to Herod; that so, if he got the better, she might become\r\nmistress of Arabia, or, if he were worsted, of Judea; and that she might\r\ndestroy one of those kings by the other.\r\n\r\n2. However, this contrivance tended to the advantage of Herod; for at\r\nthe very first he took hostages from the enemy, and got together a great\r\nbody of horse, and ordered them to march against them about Diespous;\r\nand he conquered that army, although it fought resolutely against him.\r\nAfter which defeat, the Arabians were in great motion, and assembled\r\nthemselves together at Kanatha, a city of Celesyria, in vast multitudes,\r\nand waited for the Jews. And when Herod was come thither, he tried to\r\nmanage this war with particular prudence, and gave orders that they\r\nshould build a wall about their camp; yet did not the multitude comply\r\nwith those orders, but were so emboldened by their foregoing victory,\r\nthat they presently attacked the Arabians, and beat them at the first\r\nonset, and then pursued them; yet were there snares laid for Herod in\r\nthat pursuit; while Athenio, who was one of Cleopatra's generals, and\r\nalways an antagonist to Herod, sent out of Kanatha the men of that\r\ncountry against him; for, upon this fresh onset, the Arabians took\r\ncourage, and returned back, and both joined their numerous forces about\r\nstony places, that were hard to be gone over, and there put Herod's men\r\nto the rout, and made a great slaughter of them; but those that escaped\r\nout of the battle fled to Ormiza, where the Arabians surrounded their\r\ncamp, and took it, with all the men in it. 3. In a little time after\r\nthis calamity, Herod came to bring them succors; but he came too late.\r\nNow the occasion of that blow was this, that the officers would not obey\r\norders; for had not the fight begun so suddenly, Athenio had not found\r\na proper season for the snares he laid for Herod: however, he was even\r\nwith the Arabians afterward, and overran their country, and did them\r\nmore harm than their single victory could compensate. But as he\r\nwas avenging himself on his enemies, there fell upon him another\r\nprovidential calamity; for in the seventh 29 year of his reign, when the\r\nwar about Actium was at the height, at the beginning of the spring, the\r\nearth was shaken, and destroyed an immense number of cattle, with thirty\r\nthousand men; but the army received no harm, because it lay in the open\r\nair. In the mean time, the fame of this earthquake elevated the Arabians\r\nto greater courage, and this by augmenting it to a fabulous height, as\r\nis constantly the case in melancholy accidents, and pretending that all\r\nJudea was overthrown. Upon this supposal, therefore, that they should\r\neasily get a land that was destitute of inhabitants into their power,\r\nthey first sacrificed those ambassadors who were come to them from the\r\nJews, and then marched into Judea immediately. Now the Jewish nation\r\nwere affrighted at this invasion, and quite dispirited at the greatness\r\nof their calamities one after another; whom yet Herod got together, and\r\nendeavored to encourage to defend themselves by the following speech\r\nwhich he made to them:\r\n\r\n4. \"The present dread you are under seems to me to have seized upon\r\nyou very unreasonably. It is true, you might justly be dismayed at\r\nthat providential chastisement which hath befallen you; but to suffer\r\nyourselves to be equally terrified at the invasion of men is unmanly. As\r\nfor myself, I am so far from being affrighted at our enemies after this\r\nearthquake, that I imagine that God hath thereby laid a bait for the\r\nArabians, that we may be avenged on them; for their present invasion\r\nproceeds more from our accidental misfortunes, than that they have any\r\ngreat dependence on their weapons, or their own fitness for action.\r\nNow that hope which depends not on men's own power, but on others' ill\r\nsuccess, is a very ticklish thing; for there is no certainty among men,\r\neither in their bad or good fortunes; but we may easily observe that\r\nfortune is mutable, and goes from one side to another; and this you may\r\nreadily learn from examples among yourselves; for when you were once\r\nvictors in the former fight, your enemies overcame you at last; and very\r\nlikely it will now happen so, that these who think themselves sure of\r\nbeating you will themselves be beaten. For when men are very confident,\r\nthey are not upon their guard, while fear teaches men to act with\r\ncaution; insomuch that I venture to prove from your very timorousness\r\nthat you ought to take courage; for when you were more bold than you\r\nought to have been, and than I would have had you, and marched on,\r\nAthenio's treachery took place; but your present slowness and seeming\r\ndejection of mind is to me a pledge and assurance of victory. And\r\nindeed it is proper beforehand to be thus provident; but when we come\r\nto action, we ought to erect our minds, and to make our enemies, be they\r\never so wicked, believe that neither any human, no, nor any providential\r\nmisfortune, can ever depress the courage of Jews while they are alive;\r\nnor will any of them ever overlook an Arabian, or suffer such a one to\r\nbecome lord of his good things, whom he has in a manner taken captive,\r\nand that many times also. And do not you disturb yourselves at the\r\nquaking of inanimate creatures, nor do you imagine that this earthquake\r\nis a sign of another calamity; for such affections of the elements are\r\naccording to the course of nature, nor does it import any thing further\r\nto men, than what mischief it does immediately of itself. Perhaps there\r\nmay come some short sign beforehand in the case of pestilences, and\r\nfamines, and earthquakes; but these calamities themselves have their\r\nforce limited by themselves [without foreboding any other calamity]. And\r\nindeed what greater mischief can the war, though it should be a violent\r\none, do to us than the earthquake hath done? Nay, there is a signal of\r\nour enemies' destruction visible, and that a very great one also; and\r\nthis is not a natural one, nor derived from the hand of foreigners\r\nneither, but it is this, that they have barbarously murdered our\r\nambassadors, contrary to the common law of mankind; and they have\r\ndestroyed so many, as if they esteemed them sacrifices for God, in\r\nrelation to this war. But they will not avoid his great eye, nor his\r\ninvincible right hand; and we shall be revenged of them presently, in\r\ncase we still retain any of the courage of our forefathers, and rise up\r\nboldly to punish these covenant-breakers. Let every one therefore go on\r\nand fight, not so much for his wife or his children, or for the\r\ndanger his country is in, as for these ambassadors of ours; those dead\r\nambassadors will conduct this war of ours better than we ourselves who\r\nare alive. And if you will be ruled by me, I will myself go before\r\nyou into danger; for you know this well enough, that your courage is\r\nirresistible, unless you hurt yourselves by acting rashly.\" 30\r\n\r\n5. When Herod had encouraged them by this speech, and he saw with\r\nwhat alacrity they went, he offered sacrifice to God; and after that\r\nsacrifice, he passed over the river Jordan with his army, and pitched\r\nhis camp about Philadelphia, near the enemy, and about a fortification\r\nthat lay between them. He then shot at them at a distance, and was\r\ndesirous to come to an engagement presently; for some of them had been\r\nsent beforehand to seize upon that fortification: but the king sent some\r\nwho immediately beat them out of the fortification, while he himself\r\nwent in the forefront of the army, which he put in battle-array every\r\nday, and invited the Arabians to fight. But as none of them came out\r\nof their camp, for they were in a terrible fright, and their general,\r\nElthemus, was not able to say a word for fear,--so Herod came upon\r\nthem, and pulled their fortification to pieces, by which means they were\r\ncompelled to come out to fight, which they did in disorder, and so that\r\nthe horsemen and foot-men were mixed together. They were indeed superior\r\nto the Jews in number, but inferior in their alacrity, although they\r\nwere obliged to expose themselves to danger by their very despair of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n6. Now while they made opposition, they had not a great number slain;\r\nbut as soon as they turned their backs, a great many were trodden to\r\npieces by the Jews, and a great many by themselves, and so perished,\r\ntill five thousand were fallen down dead in their flight, while the rest\r\nof the multitude prevented their immediate death, by crowding into the\r\nfortification. Herod encompassed these around, and besieged them; and\r\nwhile they were ready to be taken by their enemies in arms, they had\r\nanother additional distress upon them, which was thirst and want of\r\nwater; for the king was above hearkening to their ambassadors; and when\r\nthey offered five hundred talents, as the price of their redemption,\r\nhe pressed still harder upon them. And as they were burnt up by their\r\nthirst, they came out and voluntarily delivered themselves up by\r\nmultitudes to the Jews, till in five days' time four thousand of them\r\nwere put into bonds; and on the sixth day the multitude that were left\r\ndespaired of saving themselves, and came out to fight: with these Herod\r\nfought, and slew again about seven thousand, insomuch that he punished\r\nArabia so severely, and so far extinguished the spirits of the men, that\r\nhe was chosen by the nation for their ruler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Herod Is Confirmed In His Kingdom By Caesar, And Cultivates\r\n     A Friendship With The Emperor By Magnificent Presents; While\r\n     Caesar Returns His Kindness By Bestowing On Him That Part Of\r\n     His Kingdom Which Had Been Taken Away From It By Cleopatra\r\n     With The Addition Of Zenodoruss Country Also.\r\n\r\n1. But now Herod was under immediate concern about a most important\r\naffair, on account of his friendship with Antony, who was already\r\novercome at Actium by Caesar; yet he was more afraid than hurt; for\r\nCaesar did not think he had quite undone Antony, while Herod continued\r\nhis assistance to him. However, the king resolved to expose himself to\r\ndangers: accordingly he sailed to Rhodes, where Caesar then abode, and\r\ncame to him without his diadem, and in the habit and appearance of a\r\nprivate person, but in his behavior as a king. So he concealed nothing\r\nof the truth, but spoke thus before his face: \"O Caesar, as I was made\r\nking of the Jews by Antony, so do I profess that I have used my royal\r\nauthority in the best manner, and entirely for his advantage; nor will I\r\nconceal this further, that thou hadst certainly found me in arms, and an\r\ninseparable companion of his, had not the Arabians hindered me. However,\r\nI sent him as many auxiliaries as I was able, and many ten thousand\r\n[cori] of corn. Nay, indeed, I did not desert my benefactor after the\r\nbow that was given him at Actium; but I gave him the best advice I was\r\nable, when I was no longer able to assist him in the war; and I told him\r\nthat there was but one way of recovering his affairs, and that was to\r\nkill Cleopatra; and I promised him that, if she were once dead, I would\r\nafford him money and walls for his security, with an army and myself\r\nto assist him in his war against thee: but his affections for Cleopatra\r\nstopped his ears, as did God himself also who hath bestowed the\r\ngovernment on thee. I own myself also to be overcome together with\r\nhim; and with his last fortune I have laid aside my diadem, and am come\r\nhither to thee, having my hopes of safety in thy virtue; and I desire\r\nthat thou wilt first consider how faithful a friend, and not whose\r\nfriend, I have been.\"\r\n\r\n2. Caesar replied to him thus: \"Nay, thou shalt not only be in safety,\r\nbut thou shalt be a king; and that more firmly than thou wast before;\r\nfor thou art worthy to reign over a great many subjects, by reason\r\nof the fastness of thy friendship; and do thou endeavor to be equally\r\nconstant in thy friendship to me, upon my good success, which is what I\r\ndepend upon from the generosity of thy disposition. However, Antony hath\r\ndone well in preferring Cleopatra to thee; for by this means we have\r\ngained thee by her madness, and thus thou hast begun to be my friend\r\nbefore I began to be thine; on which account Quintus Didius hath written\r\nto me that thou sentest him assistance against the gladiators. I do\r\ntherefore assure thee that I will confirm the kingdom to thee by decree:\r\nI shall also endeavor to do thee some further kindness hereafter, that\r\nthou mayst find no loss in the want of Antony.\"\r\n\r\n3. When Caesar had spoken such obliging things to the king, and had put\r\nthe diadem again about his head, he proclaimed what he had bestowed on\r\nhim by a decree, in which he enlarged in the commendation of the man\r\nafter a magnificent manner. Whereupon Herod obliged him to be kind\r\nto him by the presents he gave him, and he desired him to forgive\r\nAlexander, one of Antony's friends, who was become a supplicant to him.\r\nBut Caesar's anger against him prevailed, and he complained of the many\r\nand very great offenses the man whom he petitioned for had been guilty\r\nof; and by that means he rejected his petition. After this Caesar went\r\nfor Egypt through Syria, when Herod received him with royal and rich\r\nentertainments; and then did he first of all ride along with Caesar, as\r\nhe was reviewing his army about Ptolemais, and feasted him with all\r\nhis friends, and then distributed among the rest of the army what was\r\nnecessary to feast them withal. He also made a plentiful provision of\r\nwater for them, when they were to march as far as Pelusium, through a\r\ndry country, which he did also in like manner at their return thence;\r\nnor were there any necessaries wanting to that army. It was therefore\r\nthe opinion, both of Caesar and of his soldiers, that Herod's kingdom\r\nwas too small for those generous presents he made them; for which\r\nreason, when Caesar was come into Egypt, and Cleopatra and Antony were\r\ndead, he did not only bestow other marks of honor upon him, but made an\r\naddition to his kingdom, by giving him not only the country which had\r\nbeen taken from him by Cleopatra, but besides that, Gadara, and Hippos,\r\nand Samaria; and moreover, of the maritime cities, Gaza 31 and Anthedon,\r\nand Joppa, and Strato's Tower. He also made him a present of four\r\nhundred Galls [Galatians] as a guard for his body, which they had been\r\nto Cleopatra before. Nor did any thing so strongly induce Caesar to make\r\nthese presents as the generosity of him that received them.\r\n\r\n4. Moreover, after the first games at Actium, he added to his kingdom\r\nboth the region called Trachonitis, and what lay in its neighborhood,\r\nBatanea, and the country of Auranitis; and that on the following\r\noccasion: Zenodorus, who had hired the house of Lysanias, had all along\r\nsent robbers out of Trachonitis among the Damascenes; who thereupon had\r\nrecourse to Varro, the president of Syria, and desired of him that he\r\nwould represent the calamity they were in to Caesar. When Caesar was\r\nacquainted with it, he sent back orders that this nest of robbers should\r\nbe destroyed. Varro therefore made an expedition against them, and\r\ncleared the land of those men, and took it away from Zenodorus. Caesar\r\ndid also afterward bestow it on Herod, that it might not again become\r\na receptacle for those robbers that had come against Damascus. He\r\nalso made him a procurator of all Syria, and this on the tenth year\r\nafterward, when he came again into that province; and this was so\r\nestablished, that the other procurators could not do any thing in the\r\nadministration without his advice: but when Zenodorus was dead, Caesar\r\nbestowed on him all that land which lay between Trachonitis and Galilee.\r\nYet, what was still of more consequence to Herod, he was beloved by\r\nCaesar next after Agrippa, and by Agrippa next after Caesar; whence he\r\narrived at a very great degree of felicity. Yet did the greatness of his\r\nsoul exceed it, and the main part of his magnanimity was extended to the\r\npromotion of piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Of The [Temple And] Cities That Were Built By Herod And\r\n     Erected From The Very Foundations; As Also Of Those Other\r\n     Edifices That Were Erected By Him; And What Magnificence He\r\n     Showed To Foreigners; And How Fortune Was In All Things\r\n     Favorable To Him.\r\n\r\n1. Accordingly, in the fifteenth year of his reign, Herod rebuilt the\r\ntemple, and encompassed a piece of land about it with a wall, which land\r\nwas twice as large as that before enclosed. The expenses he laid\r\nout upon it were vastly large also, and the riches about it were\r\nunspeakable. A sign of which you have in the great cloisters that were\r\nerected about the temple, and the citadel which was on its north side.\r\nThe cloisters he built from the foundation, but the citadel 32 he\r\nrepaired at a vast expense; nor was it other than a royal palace, which\r\nhe called Antonia, in honor of Antony. He also built himself a palace in\r\nthe Upper city, containing two very large and most beautiful apartments;\r\nto which the holy house itself could not be compared [in largeness]. The\r\none apartment he named Caesareum, and the other Agrippium, from his [two\r\ngreat] friends.\r\n\r\n2. Yet did he not preserve their memory by particular buildings only,\r\nwith their names given them, but his generosity went as far as entire\r\ncities; for when he had built a most beautiful wall round a country in\r\nSamaria, twenty furlongs long, and had brought six thousand inhabitants\r\ninto it, and had allotted to it a most fruitful piece of land, and in\r\nthe midst of this city, thus built, had erected a very large temple to\r\nCaesar, and had laid round about it a portion of sacred land of three\r\nfurlongs and a half, he called the city Sebaste, from Sebastus, or\r\nAugustus, and settled the affairs of the city after a most regular\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n3. And when Caesar had further bestowed upon him another additional\r\ncountry, he built there also a temple of white marble, hard by the\r\nfountains of Jordan: the place is called Panium, where is a top of a\r\nmountain that is raised to an immense height, and at its side, beneath,\r\nor at its bottom, a dark cave opens itself; within which there is a\r\nhorrible precipice, that descends abruptly to a vast depth; it contains\r\na mighty quantity of water, which is immovable; and when any body lets\r\ndown any thing to measure the depth of the earth beneath the water, no\r\nlength of cord is sufficient to reach it. Now the fountains of Jordan\r\nrise at the roots of this cavity outwardly; and, as some think, this\r\nis the utmost origin of Jordan: but we shall speak of that matter more\r\naccurately in our following history.\r\n\r\n4. But the king erected other places at Jericho also, between the\r\ncitadel Cypros and the former palace, such as were better and more\r\nuseful than the former for travelers, and named them from the same\r\nfriends of his. To say all at once, there was not any place of his\r\nkingdom fit for the purpose that was permitted to be without somewhat\r\nthat was for Caesar's honor; and when he had filled his own country with\r\ntemples, he poured out the like plentiful marks of his esteem into his\r\nprovince, and built many cities which he called Cesareas.\r\n\r\n5. And when he observed that there was a city by the sea-side that was\r\nmuch decayed, [its name was Strato's Tower,] but that the place, by the\r\nhappiness of its situation, was capable of great improvements from his\r\nliberality, he rebuilt it all with white stone, and adorned it with\r\nseveral most splendid palaces, wherein he especially demonstrated his\r\nmagnanimity; for the case was this, that all the sea-shore between Dora\r\nand Joppa, in the middle, between which this city is situated, had no\r\ngood haven, insomuch that every one that sailed from Phoenicia for Egypt\r\nwas obliged to lie in the stormy sea, by reason of the south winds that\r\nthreatened them; which wind, if it blew but a little fresh, such vast\r\nwaves are raised, and dash upon the rocks, that upon their retreat the\r\nsea is in a great ferment for a long way. But the king, by the expenses\r\nhe was at, and the liberal disposal of them, overcame nature, and built\r\na haven larger than was the Pyrecum 33 [at Athens]; and in the inner\r\nretirements of the water he built other deep stations [for the ships\r\nalso].\r\n\r\n6. Now although the place where he built was greatly opposite to his\r\npurposes, yet did he so fully struggle with that difficulty, that the\r\nfirmness of his building could not easily be conquered by the sea; and\r\nthe beauty and ornament of the works were such, as though he had not had\r\nany difficulty in the operation; for when he had measured out as large a\r\nspace as we have before mentioned, he let down stones into twenty fathom\r\nwater, the greatest part of which were fifty feet in length, and nine in\r\ndepth, and ten in breadth, and some still larger. But when the haven was\r\nfilled up to that depth, he enlarged that wall which was thus already\r\nextant above the sea, till it was two hundred feet wide; one hundred of\r\nwhich had buildings before it, in order to break the force of the waves,\r\nwhence it was called Procumatia, or the first breaker of the waves; but\r\nthe rest of the space was under a stone wall that ran round it. On this\r\nwall were very large towers, the principal and most beautiful of which\r\nwas called Drusium, from Drusus, who was son-in-law to Caesar.\r\n\r\n7. There were also a great number of arches, where the mariners dwelt;\r\nand all the places before them round about was a large valley, or walk,\r\nfor a quay [or landing-place] to those that came on shore; but the\r\nentrance was on the north, because the north wind was there the most\r\ngentle of all the winds. At the mouth of the haven were on each side\r\nthree great Colossi, supported by pillars, where those Colossi that are\r\non your left hand as you sail into the port are supported by a solid\r\ntower; but those on the right hand are supported by two upright stones\r\njoined together, which stones were larger than that tower which was on\r\nthe other side of the entrance. Now there were continual edifices joined\r\nto the haven, which were also themselves of white stone; and to this\r\nhaven did the narrow streets of the city lead, and were built at equal\r\ndistances one from another. And over against the mouth of the haven,\r\nupon an elevation, there was a temple for Caesar, which was excellent\r\nboth in beauty and largeness; and therein was a Colossus of Caesar, not\r\nless than that of Jupiter Olympius, which it was made to resemble.\r\nThe other Colossus of Rome was equal to that of Juno at Argos. So he\r\ndedicated the city to the province, and the haven to the sailors there;\r\nbut the honor of the building he ascribed to Caesar, 34 and named it\r\nCesarea accordingly.\r\n\r\n8. He also built the other edifices, the amphitheater, and theater, and\r\nmarket-place, in a manner agreeable to that denomination; and appointed\r\ngames every fifth year, and called them, in like manner, Caesar's\r\nGames; and he first himself proposed the largest prizes upon the hundred\r\nninety-second olympiad; in which not only the victors themselves, but\r\nthose that came next to them, and even those that came in the third\r\nplace, were partakers of his royal bounty. He also rebuilt Anthedon,\r\na city that lay on the coast, and had been demolished in the wars, and\r\nnamed it Agrippeum. Moreover, he had so very great a kindness for his\r\nfriend Agrippa, that he had his name engraved upon that gate which he\r\nhad himself erected in the temple.\r\n\r\n9. Herod was also a lover of his father, if any other person ever was\r\nso; for he made a monument for his father, even that city which he built\r\nin the finest plain that was in his kingdom, and which had rivers and\r\ntrees in abundance, and named it Antipatris. He also built a wall about\r\na citadel that lay above Jericho, and was a very strong and very\r\nfine building, and dedicated it to his mother, and called it Cypros.\r\nMoreover, he dedicated a tower that was at Jerusalem, and called it\r\nby the name of his brother Phasaelus, whose structure, largeness, and\r\nmagnificence we shall describe hereafter. He also built another city in\r\nthe valley that leads northward from Jericho, and named it Phasaelis.\r\n\r\n10. And as he transmitted to eternity his family and friends, so did he\r\nnot neglect a memorial for himself, but built a fortress upon a mountain\r\ntowards Arabia, and named it from himself, Herodium 35 and he called\r\nthat hill that was of the shape of a woman's breast, and was sixty\r\nfurlongs distant from Jerusalem, by the same name. He also bestowed much\r\ncurious art upon it, with great ambition, and built round towers all\r\nabout the top of it, and filled up the remaining space with the most\r\ncostly palaces round about, insomuch that not only the sight of the\r\ninner apartments was splendid, but great wealth was laid out on the\r\noutward walls, and partitions, and roofs also. Besides this, he brought\r\na mighty quantity of water from a great distance, and at vast charges,\r\nand raised an ascent to it of two hundred steps of the whitest marble,\r\nfor the hill was itself moderately high, and entirely factitious. He\r\nalso built other palaces about the roots of the hill, sufficient to\r\nreceive the furniture that was put into them, with his friends also,\r\ninsomuch that, on account of its containing all necessaries, the\r\nfortress might seem to be a city, but, by the bounds it had, a palace\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n11. And when he had built so much, he showed the greatness of his soul\r\nto no small number of foreign cities. He built palaces for exercise at\r\nTripoli, and Damascus, and Ptolemais; he built a wall about Byblus,\r\nas also large rooms, and cloisters, and temples, and market-places at\r\nBerytus and Tyre, with theatres at Sidon and Damascus. He also built\r\naqueducts for those Laodiceans who lived by the sea-side; and for those\r\nof Ascalon he built baths and costly fountains, as also cloisters round\r\na court, that were admirable both for their workmanship and largeness.\r\nMoreover, he dedicated groves and meadows to some people; nay, not a few\r\ncities there were who had lands of his donation, as if they were parts\r\nof his own kingdom. He also bestowed annual revenues, and those for ever\r\nalso, on the settlements for exercises, and appointed for them, as well\r\nas for the people of Cos, that such rewards should never be wanting. He\r\nalso gave corn to all such as wanted it, and conferred upon Rhodes large\r\nsums of money for building ships; and this he did in many places,\r\nand frequently also. And when Apollo's temple had been burnt down, he\r\nrebuilt it at his own charges, after a better manner than it was before.\r\nWhat need I speak of the presents he made to the Lycians and Samnians?\r\nor of his great liberality through all Ionia? and that according\r\nto every body's wants of them. And are not the Athenians, and\r\nLacedemonians, and Nicopolitans, and that Pergamus which is in Mysia,\r\nfull of donations that Herod presented them withal? And as for that\r\nlarge open place belonging to Antioch in Syria, did not he pave it with\r\npolished marble, though it were twenty furlongs long? and this when\r\nit was shunned by all men before, because it was full of dirt and\r\nfilthiness, when he besides adorned the same place with a cloister of\r\nthe same length.\r\n\r\n12. It is true, a man may say, these were favors peculiar to those\r\nparticular places on which he bestowed his benefits; but then what\r\nfavors he bestowed on the Eleans was a donation not only in common to\r\nall Greece, but to all the habitable earth, as far as the glory of the\r\nOlympic games reached. For when he perceived that they were come to\r\nnothing, for want of money, and that the only remains of ancient Greece\r\nwere in a manner gone, he not only became one of the combatants in that\r\nreturn of the fifth-year games, which in his sailing to Rome he happened\r\nto be present at, but he settled upon them revenues of money for\r\nperpetuity, insomuch that his memorial as a combatant there can never\r\nfail. It would be an infinite task if I should go over his payments\r\nof people's debts, or tributes, for them, as he eased the people of\r\nPhasaelis, of Batanea, and of the small cities about Cilicia, of those\r\nannual pensions they before paid. However, the fear he was in much\r\ndisturbed the greatness of his soul, lest he should be exposed to envy,\r\nor seem to hunt after greater filings than he ought, while he bestowed\r\nmore liberal gifts upon these cities than did their owners themselves.\r\n\r\n13. Now Herod had a body suited to his soul, and was ever a most\r\nexcellent hunter, where he generally had good success, by the means of\r\nhis great skill in riding horses; for in one day he caught forty wild\r\nbeasts: 36 that country breeds also bears, and the greatest part of it\r\nis replenished with stags and wild asses. He was also such a warrior as\r\ncould not be withstood: many men, therefore, there are who have stood\r\namazed at his readiness in his exercises, when they saw him throw the\r\njavelin directly forward, and shoot the arrow upon the mark. And then,\r\nbesides these performances of his depending on his own strength of mind\r\nand body, fortune was also very favorable to him; for he seldom failed\r\nof success in his wars; and when he failed, he was not himself the\r\noccasion of such failings, but he either was betrayed by some, or the\r\nrashness of his own soldiers procured his defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Murder Of Aristobulus And Hyrcanus, The High Priests, As\r\n     Also Of Mariamne The Queen.\r\n\r\n1. However, fortune was avenged on Herod in his external great\r\nsuccesses, by raising him up domestical troubles; and he began to have\r\nwild disorders in his family, on account of his wife, of whom he was so\r\nvery fond. For when he came to the government, he sent away her whom\r\nhe had before married when he was a private person, and who was born at\r\nJerusalem, whose name was Doris, and married Mariamne, the daughter of\r\nAlexander, the son of Aristobulus; on whose account disturbances arose\r\nin his family, and that in part very soon, but chiefly after his return\r\nfrom Rome. For, first of all, he expelled Antipater the son of Doris,\r\nfor the sake of his sons by Mariamne, out of the city, and permitted him\r\nto come thither at no other times than at the festivals. After this\r\nhe slew his wife's grandfather, Hyrcanus, when he was returned out of\r\nParthin to him, under this pretense, that he suspected him of plotting\r\nagainst him. Now this Hyrcanus had been carried captive to Barzapharnes,\r\nwhen he overran Syria; but those of his own country beyond Euphrates\r\nwere desirous he would stay with them, and this out of the commiseration\r\nthey had for his condition; and had he complied with their desires,\r\nwhen they exhorted him not to go over the river to Herod, he had not\r\nperished: but the marriage of his granddaughter [to Herod] was his\r\ntemptation; for as he relied upon him, and was over-fond of his own\r\ncountry, he came back to it. Herod's provocation was this,--not that\r\nHyrcanus made any attempt to gain the kingdom, but that it was fitter\r\nfor him to be their king than for Herod.\r\n\r\n2. Now of the five children which Herod had by Mariamne, two of them\r\nwere daughters, and three were sons; and the youngest of these sons was\r\neducated at Rome, and there died; but the two eldest he treated as those\r\nof royal blood, on account of the nobility of their mother, and because\r\nthey were not born till he was king. But then what was stronger than all\r\nthis was the love that he bare to Mariamne, and which inflamed him every\r\nday to a great degree, and so far conspired with the other motives, that\r\nhe felt no other troubles, on account of her he loved so entirely. But\r\nMariamne's hatred to him was not inferior to his love to her. She had\r\nindeed but too just a cause of indignation from what he had done,\r\nwhile her boldness proceeded from his affection to her; so she openly\r\nreproached him with what he had done to her grandfather Hyrcanus, and to\r\nher brother Aristobulus; for he had not spared this Aristobulus, though\r\nhe were but a child; for when he had given him the high priesthood at\r\nthe age of seventeen, he slew him quickly after he had conferred that\r\ndignity upon him; but when Aristobulus had put on the holy vestments,\r\nand had approached to the altar at a festival, the multitude, in great\r\ncrowds, fell into tears; whereupon the child was sent by night to\r\nJericho, and was there dipped by the Galls, at Herod's command, in a\r\npool till he was drowned.\r\n\r\n3. For these reasons Mariamne reproached Herod, and his sister and\r\nmother, after a most contumelious manner, while he was dumb on account\r\nof his affection for her; yet had the women great indignation at her,\r\nand raised a calumny against her, that she was false to his bed;\r\nwhich thing they thought most likely to move Herod to anger. They also\r\ncontrived to have many other circumstances believed, in order to make\r\nthe thing more credible, and accused her of having sent her picture into\r\nEgypt to Antony, and that her lust was so extravagant, as to have thus\r\nshowed herself, though she was absent, to a man that ran mad after\r\nwomen, and to a man that had it in his power to use violence to her.\r\nThis charge fell like a thunderbolt upon Herod, and put him into\r\ndisorder; and that especially, because his love to her occasioned him to\r\nbe jealous, and because he considered with himself that Cleopatra was a\r\nshrewd woman, and that on her account Lysanias the king was taken off,\r\nas well as Malichus the Arabian; for his fear did not only extend to the\r\ndissolving of his marriage, but to the danger of his life.\r\n\r\n4. When therefore he was about to take a journey abroad, he committed\r\nhis wife to Joseph, his sister Salome's husband, as to one who would be\r\nfaithful to him, and bare him good-will on account of their kindred; he\r\nalso gave him a secret injunction, that if Antony slew him, he should\r\nslay her. But Joseph, without any ill design, and only in order to\r\ndemonstrate the king's love to his wife, how he could not bear to think\r\nof being separated from her, even by death itself, discovered this grand\r\nsecret to her; upon which, when Herod was come back, and as they talked\r\ntogether, and he confirmed his love to her by many oaths, and assured\r\nher that he had never such an affection for any other woman as he had\r\nfor her--\"Yes,\" says she, \"thou didst, to be sure, demonstrate thy love\r\nto me by the injunctions thou gavest Joseph, when thou commandedst him\r\nto kill me.\" 37\r\n\r\n5. When he heard that this grand secret was discovered, he was like a\r\ndistracted man, and said that Joseph would never have disclosed that\r\ninjunction of his, unless he had debauched her. His passion also made\r\nhim stark mad, and leaping out of his bed, he ran about the palace after\r\na wild manner; at which time his sister Salome took the opportunity\r\nalso to blast her reputation, and confirmed his suspicion about Joseph;\r\nwhereupon, out of his ungovernable jealousy and rage, he commanded both\r\nof them to be slain immediately; but as soon as ever his passion was\r\nover, he repented of what he had done, and as soon as his anger was\r\nworn off, his affections were kindled again. And indeed the flame of his\r\ndesires for her was so ardent, that he could not think she was dead, but\r\nwould appear, under his disorders, to speak to her as if she were\r\nstill alive, till he were better instructed by time, when his grief and\r\ntrouble, now she was dead, appeared as great as his affection had been\r\nfor her while she was living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Calumnies Against The Sons Of Mariamne. Antipateris\r\n     Preferred Before Them. They Are Accused Before Caesar, And\r\n     Herod Is Reconciled To Them.\r\n\r\n1. Now Mariamne's sons were heirs to that hatred which had been borne\r\ntheir mother; and when they considered the greatness of Herod's crime\r\ntowards her, they were suspicious of him as of an enemy of theirs; and\r\nthis first while they were educated at Rome, but still more when they\r\nwere returned to Judea. This temper of theirs increased upon them\r\nas they grew up to be men; and when they were Come to an age fit for\r\nmarriage, the one of them married their aunt Salome's daughter, which\r\nSalome had been the accuser of their mother; the other married the\r\ndaughter of Archelaus, king of Cappadocia. And now they used boldness\r\nin speaking, as well as bore hatred in their minds. Now those that\r\ncalumniated them took a handle from such their boldness, and certain\r\nof them spake now more plainly to the king that there were treacherous\r\ndesigns laid against him by both his sons; and he that was son-in-law to\r\nArchelaus, relying upon his father-in-law, was preparing to fly away, in\r\norder to accuse Herod before Caesar; and when Herod's head had been long\r\nenough filled with these calumnies, he brought Antipater, whom he had by\r\nDoris, into favor again, as a defense to him against his other sons, and\r\nbegan all the ways he possibly could to prefer him before them.\r\n\r\n2. But these sons were not able to bear this change in their affairs;\r\nbut when they saw him that was born of a mother of no family, the\r\nnobility of their birth made them unable to contain their indignation;\r\nbut whensoever they were uneasy, they showed the anger they had at\r\nit. And as these sons did day after day improve in that their anger,\r\nAntipater already exercised all his own abilities, which were very\r\ngreat, in flattering his father, and in contriving many sorts of\r\ncalumnies against his brethren, while he told some stories of them\r\nhimself, and put it upon other proper persons to raise other stories\r\nagainst them, till at length he entirely cut his brethren off from all\r\nhopes of succeeding to the kingdom; for he was already publicly put into\r\nhis father's will as his successor. Accordingly, he was sent with royal\r\nornaments, and other marks of royalty, to Caesar, excepting the diadem.\r\nHe was also able in time to introduce his mother again into Mariamne's\r\nbed. The two sorts of weapons he made use of against his brethren were\r\nflattery and calumny, whereby he brought matters privately to such a\r\npass, that the king had thoughts of putting his sons to death.\r\n\r\n3. So the father drew Alexander as far as Rome, and charged him with an\r\nattempt of poisoning him before Caesar. Alexander could hardly speak for\r\nlamentation; but having a judge that was more skillful than Antipater,\r\nand more wise than Herod, he modestly avoided laying any imputation upon\r\nhis father, but with great strength of reason confuted the calumnies\r\nlaid against him; and when he had demonstrated the innocency of his\r\nbrother, who was in the like danger with himself, he at last bewailed\r\nthe craftiness of Antipater, and the disgrace they were under. He was\r\nenabled also to justify himself, not only by a clear conscience, which\r\nhe carried within him, but by his eloquence; for he was a shrewd man\r\nin making speeches. And upon his saying at last, that if his father\r\nobjected this crime to them, it was in his power to put them to death,\r\nhe made all the audience weep; and he brought Caesar to that pass, as\r\nto reject the accusations, and to reconcile their father to them\r\nimmediately. But the conditions of this reconciliation were these,\r\nthat they should in all things be obedient to their father, and that he\r\nshould have power to leave the kingdom to which of them he pleased.\r\n\r\n4. After this the king came back from Rome, and seemed to have forgiven\r\nhis sons upon these accusations; but still so that he was not without\r\nhis suspicions of them. They were followed by Antipater, who was the\r\nfountain-head of those accusations; yet did not he openly discover his\r\nhatred to them, as revering him that had reconciled them. But as Herod\r\nsailed by Cilicia, he touched at Eleusa, 38 where Archelaus treated them\r\nin the most obliging manner, and gave him thanks for the deliverance of\r\nhis son-in-law, and was much pleased at their reconciliation; and this\r\nthe more, because he had formerly written to his friends at Rome that\r\nthey should be assisting to Alexander at his trial. So he conducted\r\nHerod as far as Zephyrium, and made him presents to the value of thirty\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n5. Now when Herod was come to Jerusalem, he gathered the people\r\ntogether, and presented to them his three sons, and gave them an\r\napologetic account of his absence, and thanked God greatly, and\r\nthanked Caesar greatly also, for settling his house when it was under\r\ndisturbances, and had procured concord among his sons, which was of\r\ngreater consequence than the kingdom itself,--\"and which I will render\r\nstill more firm; for Caesar hath put into my power to dispose of the\r\ngovernment, and to appoint my successor. Accordingly, in way of requital\r\nfor his kindness, and in order to provide for mine own advantage, I do\r\ndeclare that these three sons of mine shall be kings. And, in the first\r\nplace, I pray for the approbation of God to what I am about; and, in the\r\nnext place, I desire your approbation also. The age of one of them, and\r\nthe nobility of the other two, shall procure them the succession. Nay,\r\nindeed, my kingdom is so large that it may be sufficient for more kings.\r\nNow do you keep those in their places whom Caesar hath joined, and their\r\nfather hath appointed; and do not you pay undue or unequal respects to\r\nthem, but to every one according to the prerogative of their births;\r\nfor he that pays such respects unduly, will thereby not make him that is\r\nhonored beyond what his age requires so joyful, as he will make him\r\nthat is dishonored sorrowful. As for the kindred and friends that are\r\nto converse with them, I will appoint them to each of them, and will so\r\nconstitute them, that they may be securities for their concord; as\r\nwell knowing that the ill tempers of those with whom they converse will\r\nproduce quarrels and contentions among them; but that if these with\r\nwhom they converse be of good tempers, they will preserve their natural\r\naffections for one another. But still I desire that not these only, but\r\nall the captains of my army, have for the present their hopes placed on\r\nme alone; for I do not give away my kingdom to these my sons, but give\r\nthem royal honors only; whereby it will come to pass that they will\r\nenjoy the sweet parts of government as rulers themselves, but that the\r\nburden of administration will rest upon myself whether I will or not.\r\nAnd let every one consider what age I am of, how I have conducted my\r\nlife, and what piety I have exercised; for my age is not so great that\r\nmen may soon expect the end of my life; nor have I indulged such a\r\nluxurious way of living as cuts men off when they are young; and we\r\nhave been so religious towards God, that we [have reason to hope we] may\r\narrive at a very great age. But for such as cultivate a friendship with\r\nmy sons, so as to aim at my destruction, they shall be punished by me\r\non their account. I am not one who envy my own children, and therefore\r\nforbid men to pay them great respect; but I know that such [extravagant]\r\nrespects are the way to make them insolent. And if every one that comes\r\nnear them does but revolve this in his mind, that if he prove a good\r\nman, he shall receive a reward from me, but that if he prove seditious,\r\nhis ill-intended complaisance shall get him nothing from him to whom it\r\nis shown, I suppose they will all be of my side, that is, of my sons'\r\nside; for it will be for their advantage that I reign, and that I be\r\nat concord with them. But do you, O my good children, reflect upon\r\nthe holiness of nature itself, by whose means natural affection is\r\npreserved, even among wild beasts; in the next place, reflect upon\r\nCaesar, who hath made this reconciliation among us; and in the third\r\nplace, reflect upon me, who entreat you to do what I have power to\r\ncommand you,--continue brethren. I give you royal garments, and royal\r\nhonors; and I pray to God to preserve what I have determined, in case\r\nyou be at concord one with another.\" When the king had thus spoken, and\r\nhad saluted every one of his sons after an obliging manner, he dismissed\r\nthe multitude; some of which gave their assent to what he had said, and\r\nwished it might take effect accordingly; but for those who wished for a\r\nchange of affairs, they pretended they did not so much as hear what he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Malice Of Antipater And Doris. Alexander Is Very Uneasy\r\n     On Glaphyras Account. Herod Pardons Pheroras, Whom He\r\n     Suspected, And Salome Whom He Knew To Make Mischief Among\r\n     Them. Herod's Eunuchs Are Tortured And Alexander Is Bound.\r\n\r\n1. But now the quarrel that was between them still accompanied these\r\nbrethren when they parted, and the suspicions they had one of the\r\nother grew worse. Alexander and Aristobulus were much grieved that the\r\nprivilege of the first-born was confirmed to Antipater; as was Antipater\r\nvery angry at his brethren that they were to succeed him. But then this\r\nlast being of a disposition that was mutable and politic, he knew how to\r\nhold his tongue, and used a great deal of cunning, and thereby concealed\r\nthe hatred he bore to them; while the former, depending on the nobility\r\nof their births, had every thing upon their tongues which was in their\r\nminds. Many also there were who provoked them further, and many of their\r\n[seeming] friends insinuated themselves into their acquaintance, to\r\nspy out what they did. Now every thing that was said by Alexander was\r\npresently brought to Antipater, and from Antipater it was brought to\r\nHerod with additions. Nor could the young man say any thing in the\r\nsimplicity of his heart, without giving offense, but what he said was\r\nstill turned to calumny against him. And if he had been at any time a\r\nlittle free in his conversation, great imputations were forged from\r\nthe smallest occasions. Antipater also was perpetually setting some to\r\nprovoke him to speak, that the lies he raised of him might seem to have\r\nsome foundation of truth; and if, among the many stories that were given\r\nout, but one of them could be proved true, that was supposed to imply\r\nthe rest to be true also. And as to Antipater's friends, they were all\r\neither naturally so cautious in speaking, or had been so far bribed to\r\nconceal their thoughts, that nothing of these grand secrets got abroad\r\nby their means. Nor should one be mistaken if he called the life of\r\nAntipater a mystery of wickedness; for he either corrupted Alexander's\r\nacquaintance with money, or got into their favor by flatteries; by which\r\ntwo means he gained all his designs, and brought them to betray their\r\nmaster, and to steal away, and reveal what he either did or said. Thus\r\ndid he act a part very cunningly in all points, and wrought himself a\r\npassage by his calumnies with the greatest shrewdness; while he put on\r\na face as if he were a kind brother to Alexander and Aristobulus, but\r\nsuborned other men to inform of what they did to Herod. And when any\r\nthing was told against Alexander, he would come in, and pretend [to be\r\nof his side], and would begin to contradict what was said; but would\r\nafterward contrive matters so privately, that the king should have an\r\nindignation at him. His general aim was this,--to lay a plot, and to\r\nmake it believed that Alexander lay in wait to kill his father; for\r\nnothing afforded so great a confirmation to these calumnies as did\r\nAntipater's apologies for him.\r\n\r\n2. By these methods Herod was inflamed, and as much as his natural\r\naffection to the young men did every day diminish, so much did it\r\nincrease towards Antipater. The courtiers also inclined to the same\r\nconduct, some of their own accord, and others by the king's injunction,\r\nas particularly did Ptolemy, the king's dearest friend, as also the\r\nking's brethren, and all his children; for Antipater was all in all; and\r\nwhat was the bitterest part of all to Alexander, Antipater's mother was\r\nalso all in all; she was one that gave counsel against them, and was\r\nmore harsh than a step-mother, and one that hated the queen's sons more\r\nthan is usual to hate sons-in-law. All men did therefore already pay\r\ntheir respects to Antipater, in hopes of advantage; and it was the\r\nking's command which alienated every body [from the brethren], he having\r\ngiven this charge to his most intimate friends, that they should not\r\ncome near, nor pay any regard, to Alexander, or to his friends. Herod\r\nwas also become terrible, not only to his domestics about the court, but\r\nto his friends abroad; for Caesar had given such a privilege to no other\r\nking as he had given to him, which was this,--that he might fetch back\r\nany one that fled from him, even out of a city that was not under\r\nhis own jurisdiction. Now the young men were not acquainted with the\r\ncalumnies raised against them; for which reason they could not guard\r\nthemselves against them, but fell under them; for their father did not\r\nmake any public complaints against either of them; though in a little\r\ntime they perceived how things were by his coldness to them, and by the\r\ngreat uneasiness he showed upon any thing that troubled him. Antipater\r\nhad also made their uncle Pheroras to be their enemy, as well as their\r\naunt Salome, while he was always talking with her, as with a wife,\r\nand irritating her against them. Moreover, Alexander's wife, Glaphyra,\r\naugmented this hatred against them, by deriving her nobility and\r\ngenealogy [from great persons], and pretending that she was a lady\r\nsuperior to all others in that kingdom, as being derived by her father's\r\nside from Temenus, and by her mother's side from Darius, the son of\r\nHystaspes. She also frequently reproached Herod's sister and wives with\r\nthe ignobility of their descent; and that they were every one chosen by\r\nhim for their beauty, but not for their family. Now those wives of his\r\nwere not a few; it being of old permitted to the Jews to marry many\r\nwives, 39 and this king delighting in many; all which hated Alexander,\r\non account of Glaphyra's boasting and reproaches.\r\n\r\n3. Nay, Aristobulus had raised a quarrel between himself and Salome, who\r\nwas his mother-in-law, besides the anger he had conceived at Glaphyra's\r\nreproaches; for he perpetually upbraided his wife with the meanness\r\nof her family, and complained, that as he had married a woman of a low\r\nfamily, so had his brother Alexander married one of royal blood. At\r\nthis Salome's daughter wept, and told it her with this addition, that\r\nAlexander threatened the mothers of his other brethren, that when he\r\nshould come to the crown, he would make them weave with their maidens,\r\nand would make those brothers of his country schoolmasters; and brake\r\nthis jest upon them, that they had been very carefully instructed, to\r\nfit them for such an employment. Hereupon Salome could not contain her\r\nanger, but told all to Herod; nor could her testimony be suspected,\r\nsince it was against her own son-in-law There was also another calumny\r\nthat ran abroad and inflamed the king's mind; for he heard that these\r\nsons of his were perpetually speaking of their mother, and, among their\r\nlamentations for her, did not abstain from cursing him; and that when\r\nhe made presents of any of Mariamne's garments to his later wives, these\r\nthreatened that in a little time, instead of royal garments, they would\r\nclothe theft in no better than hair-cloth.\r\n\r\n4. Now upon these accounts, though Herod was somewhat afraid of the\r\nyoung men's high spirit, yet did he not despair of reducing them to a\r\nbetter mind; but before he went to Rome, whither he was now going by\r\nsea, he called them to him, and partly threatened them a little, as a\r\nking; but for the main, he admonished them as a father, and exhorted\r\nthem to love their brethren, and told them that he would pardon their\r\nformer offenses, if they would amend for the time to come. But they\r\nrefuted the calumnies that had been raised of them, and said they\r\nwere false, and alleged that their actions were sufficient for their\r\nvindication; and said withal, that he himself ought to shut his ears\r\nagainst such tales, and not be too easy in believing them, for that\r\nthere would never be wanting those that would tell lies to their\r\ndisadvantage, as long as any would give ear to them.\r\n\r\n5. When they had thus soon pacified him, as being their father, they got\r\nclear of the present fear they were in. Yet did they see occasion for\r\nsorrow in some time afterward; for they knew that Salome, as well as\r\ntheir uncle Pheroras, were their enemies; who were both of them heavy\r\nand severe persons, and especially Pheroras, who was a partner with\r\nHerod in all the affairs of the kingdom, excepting his diadem. He had\r\nalso a hundred talents of his own revenue, and enjoyed the advantage\r\nof all the land beyond Jordan, which he had received as a gift from his\r\nbrother, who had asked of Caesar to make him a tetrarch, as he was made\r\naccordingly. Herod had also given him a wife out of the royal family,\r\nwho was no other than his own wife's sister, and after her death had\r\nsolemnly espoused to him his own eldest daughter, with a dowry of three\r\nhundred talents; but Pheroras refused to consummate this royal marriage,\r\nout of his affection to a maidservant of his. Upon which account Herod\r\nwas very angry, and gave that daughter in marriage to a brother's son\r\nof his, [Joseph,] who was slain afterward by the Parthians; but in some\r\ntime he laid aside his anger against Pheroras, and pardoned him, as one\r\nnot able to overcome his foolish passion for the maid-servant.\r\n\r\n6. Nay, Pheroras had been accused long before, while the queen\r\n[Mariamne] was alive, as if he were in a plot to poison Herod; and there\r\ncame then so great a number of informers, that Herod himself, though he\r\nwas an exceeding lover of his brethren, was brought to believe what was\r\nsaid, and to be afraid of it also. And when he had brought many of those\r\nthat were under suspicion to the torture, he came at last to Pheroras's\r\nown friends; none of which did openly confess the crime, but they owned\r\nthat he had made preparation to take her whom he loved, and run away to\r\nthe Parthians. Costobarus also, the husband of Salome, to whom the king\r\nhad given her in marriage, after her former husband had been put to\r\ndeath for adultery, was instrumental in bringing about this contrivance\r\nand flight of his. Nor did Salome escape all calumny upon herself; for\r\nher brother Pheroras accused her that she had made an agreement to marry\r\nSilleus, the procurator of Obodas, king of Arabia, who was at bitter\r\nenmity with Herod; but when she was convicted of this, and of all that\r\nPheroras had accused her of, she obtained her pardon. The king also\r\npardoned Pheroras himself the crimes he had been accused of.\r\n\r\n7. But the storm of the whole family was removed to Alexander, and all\r\nof it rested upon his head. There were three eunuchs who were in the\r\nhighest esteem with the king, as was plain by the offices they were in\r\nabout him; for one of them was appointed to be his butler, another of\r\nthem got his supper ready for him, and the third put him into bed, and\r\nlay down by him. Now Alexander had prevailed with these men, by large\r\ngifts, to let him use them after an obscene manner; which, when it was\r\ntold to the king, they were tortured, and found guilty, and presently\r\nconfessed the criminal conversation he had with them. They also\r\ndiscovered the promises by which they were induced so to do, and how\r\nthey were deluded by Alexander, who had told them that they ought not to\r\nfix their hopes upon Herod, an old man, and one so shameless as to color\r\nhis hair, unless they thought that would make him young again; but that\r\nthey ought to fix their attention to him who was to be his successor\r\nin the kingdom, whether he would or not; and who in no long time would\r\navenge himself on his enemies, and make his friends happy and blessed,\r\nand themselves in the first place; that the men of power did already pay\r\nrespects to Alexander privately, and that the captains of the soldiery,\r\nand the officers, did secretly come to him.\r\n\r\n8. These confessions did so terrify Herod, that he durst not immediately\r\npublish them; but he sent spies abroad privately, by night and by day,\r\nwho should make a close inquiry after all that was done and said; and\r\nwhen any were but suspected [of treason], he put them to death, insomuch\r\nthat the palace was full of horribly unjust proceedings; for every body\r\nforged calumnies, as they were themselves in a state of enmity or hatred\r\nagainst others; and many there were who abused the king's bloody passion\r\nto the disadvantage of those with whom they had quarrels, and lies\r\nwere easily believed, and punishments were inflicted sooner than the\r\ncalumnies were forged. He who had just then been accusing another was\r\naccused himself, and was led away to execution together with him whom\r\nhe had convicted; for the danger the king was in of his life made\r\nexaminations be very short. He also proceeded to such a degree of\r\nbitterness, that he could not look on any of those that were not accused\r\nwith a pleasant countenance, but was in the most barbarous disposition\r\ntowards his own friends. Accordingly, he forbade a great many of them to\r\ncome to court, and to those whom he had not power to punish actually\r\nhe spake harshly. But for Antipater, he insulted Alexander, now he was\r\nunder his misfortunes, and got a stout company of his kindred together,\r\nand raised all sorts of calumny against him; and for the king, he was\r\nbrought to such a degree of terror by those prodigious slanders and\r\ncontrivances, that he fancied he saw Alexander coming to him with a\r\ndrawn sword in his hand. So he caused him to be seized upon immediately,\r\nand bound, and fell to examining his friends by torture, many of whom\r\ndied [under the torture], but would discover nothing, nor say any thing\r\nagainst their consciences; but some of them, being forced to speak\r\nfalsely by the pains they endured, said that Alexander, and his brother\r\nAristobulus, plotted against him, and waited for an opportunity to kill\r\nhim as he was hunting, and then fly away to Rome. These accusations\r\nthough they were of an incredible nature, and only framed upon the great\r\ndistress they were in, were readily believed by the king, who thought it\r\nsome comfort to him, after he had bound his son, that it might appear he\r\nhad not done it unjustly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Archelaus Procures A Reconciliation Between Alexander\r\n     Pheroras, And Herod.\r\n\r\n1. Now as to Alexander, since he perceived it impossible to persuade his\r\nfather [that he was innocent], he resolved to meet his calamities, how\r\nsevere soever they were; so he composed four books against his enemies,\r\nand confessed that he had been in a plot; but declared withal that the\r\ngreatest part [of the courtiers] were in a plot with him, and chiefly\r\nPheroras and Salome; nay, that Salome once came and forced him to lie\r\nwith her in the night time, whether he would or no. These books were put\r\ninto Herod's hands, and made a great clamor against the men in power.\r\nAnd now it was that Archelaus came hastily into Judea, as being\r\naffrighted for his son-in-law and his daughter; and he came as a proper\r\nassistant, and in a very prudent manner, and by a stratagem he obliged\r\nthe king not to execute what he had threatened; for when he was come to\r\nhim, he cried out, \"Where in the world is this wretched son-in-law of\r\nmine? Where shall I see the head of him which contrived to murder his\r\nfather, which I will tear to pieces with my own hands? I will do the\r\nsame also to my daughter, who hath such a fine husband; for although she\r\nbe not a partner in the plot, yet, by being the wife of such a creature,\r\nshe is polluted. And I cannot but admire at thy patience, against whom\r\nthis plot is laid, if Alexander be still alive; for as I came with what\r\nhaste I could from Cappadocia, I expected to find him put to death for\r\nhis crimes long ago; but still, in order to make an examination with\r\nthee about my daughter, whom, out of regard to thee and by dignity, I\r\nhad espoused to him in marriage; but now we must take counsel about them\r\nboth; and if thy paternal affection be so great, that thou canst not\r\npunish thy son, who hath plotted against thee, let us change our right\r\nhands, and let us succeed one to the other in expressing our rage upon\r\nthis occasion.\"\r\n\r\n2. When he had made this pompous declaration, he got Herod to remit of\r\nhis anger, though he were in disorder, who thereupon gave him the books\r\nwhich Alexander had composed to be read by him; and as he came to every\r\nhead, he considered of it, together with Herod. So Archelaus took hence\r\nthe occasion for that stratagem which he made use of, and by degrees\r\nhe laid the blame on those men whose names were in these books, and\r\nespecially upon Pheroras; and when he saw that the king believed him [to\r\nbe in earnest], he said, \"We must consider whether the young man be not\r\nhimself plotted against by such a number of wicked wretches, and not\r\nthou plotted against by the young man; for I cannot see any occasion for\r\nhis falling into so horrid a crime, since he enjoys the advantages of\r\nroyalty already, and has the expectation of being one of thy successors;\r\nI mean this, unless there were some persons that persuade him to it, and\r\nsuch persons as make an ill use of the facility they know there is\r\nto persuade young men; for by such persons, not only young men are\r\nsometimes imposed upon, but old men also, and by them sometimes are the\r\nmost illustrious families and kingdoms overturned.\"\r\n\r\n3. Herod assented to what he had said, and, by degrees, abated of\r\nhis anger against Alexander, but was more angry at Pheroras; for the\r\nprincipal subject of the four books was Pheroras; who perceiving that\r\nthe king's inclinations changed on a sudden, and that Archelaus's\r\nfriendship could do every thing with him, and that he had no honorable\r\nmethod of preserving himself, he procured his safety by his impudence.\r\nSo he left Alexander, and had recourse to Archelaus, who told him that\r\nhe did not see how he could get him excused, now he was directly caught\r\nin so many crimes, whereby it was evidently demonstrated that he had\r\nplotted against the king, and had been the cause of those misfortunes\r\nwhich the young man was now under, unless he would moreover leave off\r\nhis cunning knavery, and his denials of what he was charged withal, and\r\nconfess the charge, and implore pardon of his brother, who still had a\r\nkindness for him; but that if he would do so, he would afford him all\r\nthe assistance he was able.\r\n\r\n4. With this advice Pheroras complied, and putting himself into such a\r\nhabit as might most move compassion, he came with black cloth upon his\r\nbody, and tears in his eyes, and threw himself down at Herod's feet, and\r\nbegged his pardon for what he had done, and confessed that he had acted\r\nvery wickedly, and was guilty of every thing that he had been accused\r\nof, and lamented that disorder of his mind, and distraction which his\r\nlove to a woman, he said, had brought him to. So when Archelaus had\r\nbrought Pheroras to accuse and bear witness against himself, he then\r\nmade an excuse for him, and mitigated Herod's anger towards him, and\r\nthis by using certain domestical examples; for that when he had suffered\r\nmuch greater mischiefs from a brother of his own, he prefered the\r\nobligations of nature before the passion of revenge; because it is in\r\nkingdoms as it is in gross bodies, where some member or other is ever\r\nswelled by the body's weight, in which case it is not proper to cut off\r\nsuch member, but to heal it by a gentle method of cure.\r\n\r\n5. Upon Arehelaus's saying this, and much more to the same purpose,\r\nHerod's displeasure against Pheroras was mollified; yet did he persevere\r\nin his own indignation against Alexander, and said he would have his\r\ndaughter divorced, and taken away from him, and this till he had brought\r\nHerod to that pass, that, contrary to his former behavior to him,\r\nhe petitioned Archelaus for the young man, and that he would let his\r\ndaughter continue espoused to him: but Archelaus made him strongly\r\nbelieve that he would permit her to be married to any one else, but not\r\nto Alexander, because he looked upon it as a very valuable advantage,\r\nthat the relation they had contracted by that affinity, and the\r\nprivileges that went along with it, might be preserved. And when the\r\nking said that his son would take it for a great favor to him, if he\r\nwould not dissolve that marriage, especially since they had already\r\nchildren between the young man and her, and since that wife of his was\r\nso well beloved by him, and that as while she remains his wife she would\r\nbe a great preservative to him, and keep him from offending, as he had\r\nformerly done; so if she should be once torn away from him, she would be\r\nthe cause of his falling into despair, because such young men's attempts\r\nare best mollified when they are diverted from them by settling their\r\naffections at home. So Arehelaus complied with what Herod desired, but\r\nnot without difficulty, and was both himself reconciled to the young\r\nman, and reconciled his father to him also. However, he said he must,\r\nby all means, be sent to Rome to discourse with Caesar, because he had\r\nalready written a full account to him of this whole matter.\r\n\r\n6. Thus a period was put to Archelaus's stratagem, whereby he\r\ndelivered his son-in-law out of the dangers he was in; but when these\r\nreconciliations were over, they spent their time in feastings and\r\nagreeable entertainments. And when Archelaus was going away, Herod made\r\nhim a present of seventy talents, with a golden throne set with precious\r\nstones, and some eunuchs, and a concubine who was called Pannychis.\r\nHe also paid due honors to every one of his friends according to their\r\ndignity. In like manner did all the king's kindred, by his command, make\r\nglorious presents to Archelaus; and so he was conducted on his way by\r\nHerod and his nobility as far as Antioch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Eurycles <a href=\"#linknote-40\" name=\"linknoteref-40\"\r\n      id=\"linknoteref-40\">40</a> Calumniated The Sons Of Mariamne; And How\r\n     Euaratus Of Cos's Apology For Them Had No Effect.\r\n\r\n1. Now a little afterward there came into Judea a man that was much\r\nsuperior to Arehelaus's stratagems, who did not only overturn that\r\nreconciliation that had been so wisely made with Alexander, but proved\r\nthe occasion of his ruin. He was a Lacedemonian, and his name was\r\nEurycles. He was so corrupt a man, that out of the desire of getting\r\nmoney, he chose to live under a king, for Greece could not suffice his\r\nluxury. He presented Herod with splendid gifts, as a bait which he\r\nlaid in order to compass his ends, and quickly received them back again\r\nmanifold; yet did he esteem bare gifts as nothing, unless he imbrued the\r\nkingdom in blood by his purchases. Accordingly, he imposed upon the king\r\nby flattering him, and by talking subtlely to him, as also by the lying\r\nencomiums which he made upon him; for as he soon perceived Herod's blind\r\nside, so he said and did every thing that might please him, and thereby\r\nbecame one of his most intimate friends; for both the king and all that\r\nwere about him had a great regard for this Spartan, on account of his\r\ncountry. 41\r\n\r\n2. Now as soon as this fellow perceived the rotten parts of the family,\r\nand what quarrels the brothers had one with another, and in what\r\ndisposition the father was towards each of them, he chose to take his\r\nlodging at the first in the house of Antipater, but deluded Alexander\r\nwith a pretense of friendship to him, and falsely claimed to be an old\r\nacquaintance of Archelaus; for which reason he was presently admitted\r\ninto Alexander's familiarity as a faithful friend. He also soon\r\nrecommended himself to his brother Aristobulus. And when he had thus\r\nmade trial of these several persons, he imposed upon one of them by one\r\nmethod, and upon another by another. But he was principally hired by\r\nAntipater, and so betrayed Alexander, and this by reproaching Antipater,\r\nbecause, while he was the eldest son he overlooked the intrigues of\r\nthose who stood in the way of his expectations; and by reproaching\r\nAlexander, because he who was born of a queen, and was married to a\r\nking's daughter, permitted one that was born of a mean woman to lay\r\nclaim to the succession, and this when he had Archelaus to support him\r\nin the most complete manner. Nor was his advice thought to be other\r\nthan faithful by the young man, because of his pretended friendship\r\nwith Archelaus; on which account it was that Alexander lamented to him\r\nAntipater's behavior with regard to himself, and this without concealing\r\nany thing from him; and how it was no wonder if Herod, after he had\r\nkilled their mother, should deprive them of her kingdom. Upon this\r\nEurycles pretended to commiserate his condition, and to grieve with him.\r\nHe also, by a bait that he laid for him, procured Aristobulus to say the\r\nsame things. Thus did he inveigle both the brothers to make complaints\r\nof their father, and then went to Antipater, and carried these grand\r\nsecrets to him. He also added a fiction of his own, as if his brothers\r\nhad laid a plot against him, and were almost ready to come upon him with\r\ntheir drawn swords. For this intelligence he received a great sum of\r\nmoney, and on that account he commended Antipater before his father, and\r\nat length undertook the work of bringing Alexander and Aristobulus to\r\ntheir graves, and accused them before their father. So he came to Herod,\r\nand told him that he would save his life, as a requital for the favors\r\nhe had received from him, and would preserve his light [of life] by way\r\nof retribution for his kind entertainment; for that a sword had been\r\nlong whetted, and Alexander's right hand had been long stretched out\r\nagainst him; but that he had laid impediments in his way, prevented his\r\nspeed, and that by pretending to assist him in his design: how Alexander\r\nsaid that Herod was not contented to reign in a kingdom that belonged to\r\nothers, and to make dilapidations in their mother's government after\r\nhe had killed her; but besides all this, that he introduced a spurious\r\nsuccessor, and proposed to give the kingdom of their ancestors to that\r\npestilent fellow Antipater:--that he would now appease the ghosts of\r\nHyrcanus and Mariamne, by taking vengeance on him; for that it was not\r\nfit for him to take the succession to the government from such a father\r\nwithout bloodshed: that many things happen every day to provoke him so\r\nto do, insomuch that he can say nothing at all, but it affords occasion\r\nfor calumny against him; for that if any mention be made of nobility\r\nof birth, even in other cases, he is abused unjustly, while his father\r\nwould say that nobody, to be sure, is of noble birth but Alexander, and\r\nthat his father was inglorious for want of such nobility. If they be\r\nat any time hunting, and he says nothing, he gives offense; and if he\r\ncommends any body, they take it in way of jest. That they always find\r\ntheir father unmercifully severe, and have no natural affection for\r\nany of them but for Antipater; on which accounts, if this plot does not\r\ntake, he is very willing to die; but that in case he kill his father, he\r\nhath sufficient opportunities for saving himself. In the first place, he\r\nhath Archelaus his father-in-law to whom he can easily fly; and in the\r\nnext place, he hath Caesar, who had never known Herod's character to\r\nthis day; for that he shall not appear then before him with that dread\r\nhe used to do when his father was there to terrify him; and that he\r\nwill not then produce the accusations that concerned himself alone,\r\nbut would, in the first place, openly insist on the calamities of their\r\nnation, and how they are taxed to death, and in what ways of luxury and\r\nwicked practices that wealth is spent which was gotten by bloodshed;\r\nwhat sort of persons they are that get our riches, and to whom those\r\ncities belong upon whom he bestows his favors; that he would have\r\ninquiry made what became of his grandfather [Hyrcanus], and his mother\r\n[Mariamne], and would openly proclaim the gross wickedness that was in\r\nthe kingdom; on which accounts he should not be deemed a parricide.\r\n\r\n3. When Eurycles had made this portentous speech, he greatly commended\r\nAntipater, as the only child that had an affection for his father,\r\nand on that account was an impediment to the other's plot against him.\r\nHereupon the king, who had hardly repressed his anger upon the former\r\naccusations, was exasperated to an incurable degree. At which time\r\nAntipater took another occasion to send in other persons to his\r\nfather to accuse his brethren, and to tell him that they had privately\r\ndiscoursed with Jucundus and Tyrannus, who had once been masters of\r\nthe horse to the king, but for some offenses had been put out of\r\nthat honorable employment. Herod was in a very great rage at these\r\ninformations, and presently ordered those men to be tortured; yet did\r\nnot they confess any thing of what the king had been informed; but a\r\ncertain letter was produced, as written by Alexander to the governor of\r\na castle, to desire him to receive him and Aristobulus into the castle\r\nwhen he had killed his father, and to give them weapons, and what other\r\nassistance he could, upon that occasion. Alexander said that this letter\r\nwas a forgery of Diophantus. This Diophantus was the king's secretary, a\r\nbold man, and cunning in counterfeiting any one's hand; and after he had\r\ncounterfeited a great number, he was at last put to death for it.\r\nHerod did also order the governor of the castle to be tortured, but got\r\nnothing out of him of what the accusations suggested.\r\n\r\n4. However, although Herod found the proofs too weak, he gave order to\r\nhave his sons kept in custody; for till now they had been at liberty.\r\nHe also called that pest of his family, and forger of all this vile\r\naccusation, Eurycles, his savior and benefactor, and gave him a reward\r\nof fifty talents. Upon which he prevented any accurate accounts that\r\ncould come of what he had done, by going immediately into Cappadocia,\r\nand there he got money of Archelaus, having the impudence to pretend\r\nthat he had reconciled Herod to Alexander. He thence passed over into\r\nGreece, and used what he had thus wickedly gotten to the like wicked\r\npurposes. Accordingly, he was twice accused before Caesar, that he had\r\nfilled Achaia with sedition, and had plundered its cities; and so he was\r\nsent into banishment. And thus was he punished for what wicked actions\r\nhe had been guilty of about Aristobulus and Alexander.\r\n\r\n5. But it will now be worth while to put Euaratus of Cos in opposition\r\nto this Spartan; for as he was one of Alexander's most intimate friends,\r\nand came to him in his travels at the same time that Eurycles came;\r\nso the king put the question to him, whether those things of which\r\nAlexander was accused were true? He assured him upon oath that he had\r\nnever heard any such things from the young men; yet did this testimony\r\navail nothing for the clearing those miserable creatures; for Herod was\r\nonly disposed and most ready to hearken to what made against them, and\r\nevery one was most agreeable to him that would believe they were guilty,\r\nand showed their indignation at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Herod By Caesars Direction Accuses His Sons At Eurytus. They\r\n     Are Not Produced Before The Courts But Yet Are Condemned;\r\n     And In A Little Time They Are Sent To Sebaste, And Strangled\r\n     There.\r\n\r\n1. Moreover, Salome exasperated Herod's cruelty against his sons; for\r\nAristobulus was desirous to bring her, who was his mother-in-law and his\r\naunt, into the like dangers with themselves; so he sent to her to take\r\ncare of her own safety, and told her that the king was preparing to put\r\nher to death, on account of the accusation that was laid against her, as\r\nif when she formerly endeavored to marry herself to Sylleus the Arabian,\r\nshe had discovered the king's grand secrets to him, who was the king's\r\nenemy; and this it was that came as the last storm, and entirely sunk\r\nthe young men when they were in great danger before. For Salome came\r\nrunning to the king, and informed him of what admonition had been given\r\nher; whereupon he could bear no longer, but commanded both the young\r\nmen to be bound, and kept the one asunder from the other. He also sent\r\nVolumnius, the general of his army, to Caesar immediately, as also his\r\nfriend Olympus with him, who carried the informations in writing along\r\nwith them. Now as soon as they had sailed to Rome, and delivered the\r\nking's letters to Caesar, Caesar was mightily troubled at the case of\r\nthe young men; yet did not he think he ought to take the power from the\r\nfather of condemning his sons; so he wrote back to him, and appointed\r\nhim to have the power over his sons; but said withal, that he would do\r\nwell to make an examination into this matter of the plot against him in\r\na public court, and to take for his assessors his own kindred, and the\r\ngovernors of the province. And if those sons be found guilty, to put\r\nthem to death; but if they appear to have thought of no more than flying\r\naway from him, that he should moderate their punishment.\r\n\r\n2. With these directions Herod complied, and came to Berytus, where\r\nCaesar had ordered the court to be assembled, and got the judicature\r\ntogether. The presidents sat first, as Caesar's letters had appointed,\r\nwho were Saturninus and Pedanius, and their lieutenants that were with\r\nthem, with whom was the procurator Volumnius also; next to them sat the\r\nking's kinsmen and friends, with Salome also, and Pheroras; after whom\r\nsat the principal men of all Syria, excepting Archelaus; for Herod had a\r\nsuspicion of him, because he was Alexander's father-in-law. Yet did not\r\nhe produce his sons in open court; and this was done very cunningly,\r\nfor he knew well enough that had they but appeared only, they would\r\ncertainly have been pitied; and if withal they had been suffered to\r\nspeak, Alexander would easily have answered what they were accused of;\r\nbut they were in custody at Platane, a village of the Sidontans.\r\n\r\n3. So the king got up, and inveighed against his sons, as if they were\r\npresent; and as for that part of the accusation that they had plotted\r\nagainst him, he urged it but faintly, because he was destitute of\r\nproofs; but he insisted before the assessors on the reproaches, and\r\njests, and injurious carriage, and ten thousand the like offenses\r\nagainst him, which were heavier than death itself; and when nobody\r\ncontradicted him, he moved them to pity his case, as though he had been\r\ncondemned himself, now he had gained a bitter victory against his sons.\r\nSo he asked every one's sentence, which sentence was first of all given\r\nby Saturninus, and was this: That he condemned the young men, but not\r\nto death; for that it was not fit for him, who had three sons of his\r\nown now present, to give his vote for the destruction of the sons of\r\nanother. The two lieutenants also gave the like vote; some others there\r\nwere also who followed their example; but Volumnius began to vote on the\r\nmore melancholy side, and all those that came after him condemned the\r\nyoung men to die, some out of flattery, and some out of hatred to Herod;\r\nbut none out of indignation at their crimes. And now all Syria and Judea\r\nwas in great expectation, and waited for the last act of this tragedy;\r\nyet did nobody, suppose that Herod would be so barbarous as to murder\r\nhis children: however, he carried them away to Tyre, and thence sailed\r\nto Cesarea, and deliberated with himself what sort of death the young\r\nmen should suffer.\r\n\r\n4. Now there was a certain old soldier of the king's, whose name\r\nwas Tero, who had a son that was very familiar with and a friend to\r\nAlexander, and who himself particularly loved the young men. This\r\nsoldier was in a manner distracted, out of the excess of the indignation\r\nhe had at what was doing; and at first he cried out aloud, as he went\r\nabout, that justice was trampled under foot; that truth was perished,\r\nand nature confounded; and that the life of man was full of iniquity,\r\nand every thing else that passion could suggest to a man who spared\r\nnot his own life; and at last he ventured to go to the king, and said,\r\n\"Truly I think thou art a most miserable man, when thou hearkenest to\r\nmost wicked wretches, against those that ought to be dearest to thee;\r\nsince thou hast frequently resolved that Pheroras and Salome should be\r\nput to death, and yet believest them against thy sons; while these,\r\nby cutting off the succession of thine own sons, leave all wholly\r\nto Antipater, and thereby choose to have thee such a king as may be\r\nthoroughly in their own power. However, consider whether this death of\r\nAntipater's brethren will not make him hated by the soldiers; for there\r\nis nobody but commiserates the young men; and of the captains, a great\r\nmany show their indignation at it openly.\" Upon his saying this, he\r\nnamed those that had such indignation; but the king ordered those men,\r\nwith Tero himself and his son, to be seized upon immediately.\r\n\r\n5. At which time there was a certain barber, whose name was Trypho. This\r\nman leaped out from among the people in a kind of madness, and accused\r\nhimself, and said, \"This Tero endeavored to persuade me also to cut thy\r\nthroat with my razor, when I trimmed thee, and promised that Alexander\r\nshould give me large presents for so doing.\" When Herod heard this, he\r\nexamined Tero, with his son and the barber, by the torture; but as the\r\nothers denied the accusation, and he said nothing further, Herod gave\r\norder that Tero should be racked more severely; but his son, out of pity\r\nto his father, promised to discover the whole to the king, if he would\r\ngrant [that his father should be no longer tortured]. When he had agreed\r\nto this, he said that his father, at the persuasion of Alexander, had an\r\nintention to kill him. Now some said this was forged, in order to free\r\nhis father from his torments; and some said it was true.\r\n\r\n6. And now Herod accused the captains and Tero in an assembly of the\r\npeople, and brought the people together in a body against them; and\r\naccordingly there were they put to death, together with [Trypho] the\r\nbarber; they were killed by the pieces of wood and the stones that were\r\nthrown at them. He also sent his sons to Sebaste, a city not far from\r\nCesarea, and ordered them to be there strangled; and as what he had\r\nordered was executed immediately, so he commanded that their dead\r\nbodies should be brought to the fortress Alexandrium, to be buried with\r\nAlexander, their grandfather by the mother's side. And this was the end\r\nof Alexander and Aristobulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Antipater Is Hated Of All Men; And How The King Espouses\r\n     The Sons Of Those That Had Been Slain To His Kindred; But\r\n     That Antipater Made Him Change Them For Other Women. Of\r\n     Herod's Marriages, And Children.\r\n\r\n1. But an intolerable hatred fell upon Antipater from the nation, though\r\nhe had now an indisputable title to the succession, because they all\r\nknew that he was the person who contrived all the calumnies against\r\nhis brethren. However, he began to be in a terrible fear, as he saw the\r\nposterity of those that had been slain growing up; for Alexander had two\r\nsons by Glaphyra, Tigranes and Alexander; and Aristobulus had Herod,\r\nand Agrippa, and Aristobulus, his sons, with Herodias and Mariamne,\r\nhis daughters, and all by Bernice, Salome's daughter. As for Glaphyra,\r\nHerod, as soon as he had killed Alexander, sent her back, together with\r\nher portion, to Cappadocia. He married Bernice, Aristobulus's daughter,\r\nto Antipater's uncle by his mother, and it was Antipater who, in\r\norder to reconcile her to him, when she had been at variance with him,\r\ncontrived this match; he also got into Pheroras's favor, and into\r\nthe favor of Caesar's friends, by presents, and other ways of\r\nobsequiousness, and sent no small sums of money to Rome; Saturninus\r\nalso, and his friends in Syria, were all well replenished with the\r\npresents he made them; yet the more he gave, the more he was hated, as\r\nnot making these presents out of generosity, but spending his money out\r\nof fear. Accordingly, it so fell out that the receivers bore him no more\r\ngood-will than before, but that those to whom he gave nothing were his\r\nmore bitter enemies. However, he bestowed his money every day more and\r\nmore profusely, on observing that, contrary to his expectations, the\r\nking was taking care about the orphans, and discovering at the same time\r\nhis repentance for killing their fathers, by his commiseration of those\r\nthat sprang from them.\r\n\r\n2. Accordingly, Herod got together his kindred and friends, and set\r\nbefore them the children, and, with his eyes full of tears, said thus\r\nto them: \"It was an unlucky fate that took away from me these\r\nchildren's fathers, which children are recommended to me by that natural\r\ncommiseration which their orphan condition requires; however, I will\r\nendeavor, though I have been a most unfortunate father, to appear a\r\nbetter grandfather, and to leave these children such curators after\r\nmyself as are dearest to me. I therefore betroth thy daughter, Pheroras,\r\nto the elder of these brethren, the children of Alexander, that thou\r\nmayst be obliged to take care of them. I also betroth to thy son,\r\nAntipater, the daughter of Aristobulus; be thou therefore a father to\r\nthat orphan; and my son Herod [Philip] shall have her sister, whose\r\ngrandfather, by the mother's side, was high priest. And let every one\r\nthat loves me be of my sentiments in these dispositions, which none that\r\nhath an affection for me will abrogate. And I pray God that he will join\r\nthese children together in marriage, to the advantage of my kingdom, and\r\nof my posterity; and may he look down with eyes more serene upon them\r\nthan he looked upon their fathers.\"\r\n\r\n3. While he spake these words he wept, and joined the children's\r\nright hands together; after which he embraced them every one after an\r\naffectionate manner, and dismissed the assembly. Upon this, Antipater\r\nwas in great disorder immediately, and lamented publicly at what was\r\ndone; for he supposed that this dignity which was conferred on these\r\norphans was for his own destruction, even in his father's lifetime, and\r\nthat he should run another risk of losing the government, if Alexander's\r\nsons should have both Archelaus [a king], and Pheroras a tetrarch, to\r\nsupport them. He also considered how he was himself hated by the nation,\r\nand how they pitied these orphans; how great affection the Jews bare\r\nto those brethren of his when they were alive, and how gladly they\r\nremembered them now they had perished by his means. So he resolved by\r\nall the ways possible to get these espousals dissolved.\r\n\r\n4. Now he was afraid of going subtlely about this matter with his\r\nfather, who was hard to be pleased, and was presently moved upon the\r\nleast suspicion: so he ventured to go to him directly, and to beg of\r\nhim before his face not to deprive him of that dignity which he had been\r\npleased to bestow upon him; and that he might not have the bare name of\r\na king, while the power was in other persons; for that he should never\r\nbe able to keep the government, if Alexander's son was to have both his\r\ngrandfather Archelaus and Pheroras for his curators; and he besought him\r\nearnestly, since there were so many of the royal family alive, that he\r\nwould change those [intended] marriages. Now the king had nine wives, 42\r\nand children by seven of them; Antipater was himself born of Doris, and\r\nHerod Philip of Mariamne, the high priest's daughter; Antipas also and\r\nArchelaus were by Malthace, the Samaritan, as was his daughter Olympias,\r\nwhich his brother Joseph's 43 son had married. By Cleopatra of Jerusalem\r\nhe had Herod and Philip; and by Pallas, Phasaelus; he had also two\r\ndaughters, Roxana and Salome, the one by Phedra, and the other by Elpis;\r\nhe had also two wives that had no children, the one his first cousin,\r\nand the other his niece; and besides these he had two daughters, the\r\nsisters of Alexander and Aristobulus, by Mariamne. Since, therefore,\r\nthe royal family was so numerous, Antipater prayed him to change these\r\nintended marriages.\r\n\r\n5. When the king perceived what disposition he was in towards these\r\norphans, he was angry at it, and a suspicion came into his mind as to\r\nthose sons whom he had put to death, whether that had not been brought\r\nabout by the false tales of Antipater; so that at that time he made\r\nAntipater a long and a peevish answer, and bid him begone. Yet was he\r\nafterwards prevailed upon cunningly by his flatteries, and changed the\r\nmarriages; he married Aristobulus's daughter to him, and his son to\r\nPheroras's daughter.\r\n\r\n6. Now one may learn, in this instance, how very much this flattering\r\nAntipater could do,--even what Salome in the like circumstances could\r\nnot do; for when she, who was his sister, and who, by the means of\r\nJulia, Caesar's wife, earnestly desired leave to be married to Sylleus\r\nthe Arabian, Herod swore he would esteem her his bitter enemy, unless\r\nshe would leave off that project: he also caused her, against her own\r\nconsent, to be married to Alexas, a friend of his, and that one of\r\nher daughters should be married to Alexas's son, and the other to\r\nAntipater's uncle by the mother's side. And for the daughters the king\r\nhad by Mariamne, the one was married to Antipater, his sister's son, and\r\nthe other to his brother's son, Phasaelus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Antipater Becomes Intolerable.

Now when Antipater had cut off the hopes of the orphans, and had\r\ncontracted such affinities as would be most for his own advantage, he\r\nproceeded briskly, as having a certain expectation of the kingdom; and\r\nas he had now assurance added to his wickedness, he became intolerable;\r\nfor not being able to avoid the hatred of all people, he built his\r\nsecurity upon the terror he struck into them. Pheroras also assisted him\r\nin his designs, looking upon him as already fixed in the kingdom.\r\nThere was also a company of women in the court, which excited new\r\ndisturbances; for Pheroras's wife, together with her mother and sister,\r\nas also Antipater's mother, grew very impudent in the palace. She also\r\nwas so insolent as to affront the king's two daughters, 44 on which\r\naccount the king hated her to a great degree; yet although these women\r\nwere hated by him, they domineered over others: there was only Salome\r\nwho opposed their good agreement, and informed the king of their\r\nmeetings, as not being for the advantage of his affairs. And when those\r\nwomen knew what calumnies she had raised against them, and how much\r\nHerod was displeased, they left off their public meetings, and friendly\r\nentertainments of one another; nay, on the contrary, they pretended\r\nto quarrel one with another when the king was within hearing. The like\r\ndissimulation did Antipater make use of; and when matters were public,\r\nhe opposed Pheroras; but still they had private cabals and merry\r\nmeetings in the night time; nor did the observation of others do any\r\nmore than confirm their mutual agreement. However, Salome knew every\r\nthing they did, and told every thing to Herod.\r\n\r\n2. But he was inflamed with anger at them, and chiefly at Pheroras's\r\nwife; for Salome had principally accused her. So he got an assembly of\r\nhis friends and kindred together, and there accused this woman of many\r\nthings, and particularly of the affronts she had offered his daughters;\r\nand that she had supplied the Pharisees with money, by way of rewards\r\nfor what they had done against him, and had procured his brother to\r\nbecome his enemy, by giving him love potions. At length he turned his\r\nspeech to Pheroras, and told him that he would give him his choice of\r\nthese two things: Whether he would keep in with his brother, or with his\r\nwife? And when Pheroras said that he would die rather than forsake his\r\nwife, Herod, not knowing what to do further in that matter, turned his\r\nspeech to Antipater, and charged him to have no intercourse either with\r\nPheroras's wife, or with Pheroras himself, or with any one belonging\r\nto her. Now though Antipater did not transgress that his injunction\r\npublicly, yet did he in secret come to their night meetings; and because\r\nhe was afraid that Salome observed what he did, he procured, by the\r\nmeans of his Italian friends, that he might go and live at Rome; for\r\nwhen they wrote that it was proper for Antipater to be sent to Caesar\r\nfor some time, Herod made no delay, but sent him, and that with a\r\nsplendid attendance, and a great deal of money, and gave him his\r\ntestament to carry with him,--wherein Antipater had the kingdom\r\nbequeathed to him, and wherein Herod was named for Antipater's\r\nsuccessor; that Herod, I mean, who was the son of Mariamne, the high\r\npriest's daughter.\r\n\r\n3. Sylleus also, the Arabian, sailed to Rome, without any regard to\r\nCaesar's injunctions, and this in order to oppose Antipater with all\r\nhis might, as to that law-suit which Nicolaus had with him before. This\r\nSylleus had also a great contest with Aretas his own king; for he had\r\nslain many others of Aretas's friends, and particularly Sohemus, the\r\nmost potent man in the city Petra. Moreover, he had prevailed with\r\nPhabatus, who was Herod's steward, by giving him a great sum of money,\r\nto assist him against Herod; but when Herod gave him more, he induced\r\nhim to leave Sylleus, and by this means he demanded of him all that\r\nCaesar had required of him to pay. But when Sylleus paid nothing of what\r\nhe was to pay, and did also accuse Phabatus to Caesar, and said that he\r\nwas not a steward for Caesar's advantage, but for Herod's, Phabatus was\r\nangry at him on that account, but was still in very great esteem with\r\nHerod, and discovered Sylleus's grand secrets, and told the king that\r\nSylleus had corrupted Corinthus, one of the guards of his body, by\r\nbribing him, and of whom he must therefore have a care. Accordingly, the\r\nking complied; for this Corinthus, though he was brought up in Herod's\r\nkingdom, yet was he by birth an Arabian; so the king ordered him to be\r\ntaken up immediately, and not only him, but two other Arabians, who were\r\ncaught with him; the one of them was Sylleus's friend, the other the\r\nhead of a tribe. These last, being put to the torture, confessed that\r\nthey had prevailed with Corinthus, for a large sum of money, to kill\r\nHerod; and when they had been further examined before Saturninus, the\r\npresident of Syria, they were sent to Rome.\r\n\r\n4. However, Herod did not leave off importuning Pheroras, but proceeded\r\nto force him to put away his wife; 45 yet could he not devise any way\r\nby which he could bring the woman herself to punishment, although he\r\nhad many causes of hatred to her; till at length he was in such great\r\nuneasiness at her, that he cast both her and his brother out of his\r\nkingdom. Pheroras took this injury very patiently, and went away into\r\nhis own tetrarchy, [Perea beyond Jordan,] and sware that there should\r\nbe but one end put to his flight, and that should be Herod's death;\r\nand that he would never return while he was alive. Nor indeed would he\r\nreturn when his brother was sick, although he earnestly sent for him to\r\ncome to him, because he had a mind to leave some injunctions with him\r\nbefore he died; but Herod unexpectedly recovered. A little afterward\r\nPheroras himself fell sick, when Herod showed great moderation; for\r\nhe came to him, and pitied his case, and took care of him; but his\r\naffection for him did him no good, for Pheroras died a little afterward.\r\nNow though Herod had so great an affection for him to the last day\r\nof his life, yet was a report spread abroad that he had killed him\r\nby poison. However, he took care to have his dead body carried to\r\nJerusalem, and appointed a very great mourning to the whole nation for\r\nhim, and bestowed a most pompous funeral upon him. And this was the end\r\nthat one of Alexander's and Aristobulus's murderers came to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n     When Herod Made Inquiry About Pheroras's Death A Discovery\r\n     Was Made That Antipater Had Prepared A Poisonous Draught For\r\n     Him. Herod Casts Doris And Her Accomplices, As Also\r\n     Mariamne, Out Of The Palace And Blots Her Son Herod Out Of\r\n     His Testament.\r\n\r\n1. But now the punishment was transferred unto the original author,\r\nAntipater, and took its rise from the death of Pheroras; for certain of\r\nhis freed-men came with a sad countenance to the king, and told him that\r\nhis brother had been destroyed by poison, and that his wife had brought\r\nhim somewhat that was prepared after an unusual manner, and that, upon\r\nhis eating it, he presently fell into his distemper; that Antipater's\r\nmother and sister, two days before, brought a woman out of Arabia that\r\nwas skillful in mixing such drugs, that she might prepare a love potion\r\nfor Pheroras; and that instead of a love potion, she had given him\r\ndeadly poison; and that this was done by the management of Sylleus, who\r\nwas acquainted with that woman.\r\n\r\n2. The king was deeply affected with so many suspicions, and had the\r\nmaid-servants and some of the free women also tortured; one of which\r\ncried out in her agonies, \"May that God that governs the earth and\r\nthe heaven punish this author of all these our miseries, Antipater's\r\nmother!\" The king took a handle from this confession, and proceeded to\r\ninquire further into the truth of the matter. So this woman discovered\r\nthe friendship of Antipater's mother to Pheroras, and Antipater's women,\r\nas also their secret meetings, and that Pheroras and Antipater had drunk\r\nwith them for a whole night together as they returned from the king,\r\nand would not suffer any body, either man-servant or maidservant, to be\r\nthere; while one of the free women discovered the matter.\r\n\r\n3. Upon this Herod tortured the maid-servants every one by themselves\r\nseparately, who all unanimously agreed in the foregoing discoveries,\r\nand that accordingly by agreement they went away, Antipater to Rome, and\r\nPheroras to Perea; for that they oftentimes talked to one another thus:\r\nThat after Herod had slain Alexander and Aristobulus, he would fall upon\r\nthem, and upon their wives, because, after he Mariamne and her children\r\nhe would spare nobody; and that for this reason it was best to get as\r\nfar off the wild beast as they were able:--and that Antipater oftentimes\r\nlamented his own case before his mother, and said to her, that he had\r\nalready gray hairs upon his head, and that his father grew younger again\r\nevery day, and that perhaps death would overtake him before he should\r\nbegin to be a king in earnest; and that in case Herod should die, which\r\nyet nobody knew when it would be, the enjoyment of the succession could\r\ncertainly be but for a little time; for that these heads of Hydra, the\r\nsons of Alexander and Aristobulus, were growing up: that he was deprived\r\nby his father of the hopes of being succeeded by his children, for that\r\nhis successor after his death was not to be any one of his own sons,\r\nbut Herod the son of Mariamne: that in this point Herod was plainly\r\ndistracted, to think that his testament should therein take place; for\r\nhe would take care that not one of his posterity should remain, because\r\nhe was of all fathers the greatest hater of his children. Yet does he\r\nhate his brother still worse; whence it was that he a while ago gave\r\nhimself a hundred talents, that he should not have any intercourse with\r\nPheroras. And when Pheroras said, Wherein have we done him any harm?\r\nAntipater replied, \"I wish he would but deprive us of all we have, and\r\nleave us naked and alive only; but it is indeed impossible to escape\r\nthis wild beast, who is thus given to murder, who will not permit us to\r\nlove any person openly, although we be together privately; yet may we be\r\nso openly too, if we have but the courage and the hands of men.\"\r\n\r\n4. These things were said by the women upon the torture; as also that\r\nPheroras resolved to fly with them to Perea. Now Herod gave credit to\r\nall they said, on account of the affair of the hundred talents; for he\r\nhad no discourse with any body about them, but only with Antipater. So\r\nhe vented his anger first of all against Antipater's mother, and took\r\naway from her all the ornaments which he had given her, which cost a\r\ngreat many talents, and cast her out of the palace a second time. He\r\nalso took care of Pheroras's women after their tortures, as being now\r\nreconciled to them; but he was in great consternation himself, and\r\ninflamed upon every suspicion, and had many innocent persons led to\r\nthe torture, out of his fear lest he should leave any guilty person\r\nuntortured.\r\n\r\n5. And now it was that he betook himself to examine Antipater of\r\nSamaria, who was the steward of [his son] Antipater; and upon torturing\r\nhim, he learned that Antipater had sent for a potion of deadly poison\r\nfor him out of Egypt, by Antiphilus, a companion of his; that Theudio,\r\nthe uncle of Antipater, had it from him, and delivered it to Pheroras;\r\nfor that Antipater had charged him to take his father off while he was\r\nat Rome, and so free him from the suspicion of doing it himself: that\r\nPheroras also committed this potion to his wife. Then did the king send\r\nfor her, and bid her bring to him what she had received immediately. So\r\nshe came out of her house as if she would bring it with her, but\r\nthrew herself down from the top of the house, in order to prevent any\r\nexamination and torture from the king. However, it came to pass, as it\r\nseems by the providence of God, when he intended to bring Antipater to\r\npunishment, that she fell not upon her head, but upon other parts of her\r\nbody, and escaped. The king, when she was brought to him, took care of\r\nher, [for she was at first quite senseless upon her fall,] and asked\r\nher why she had thrown herself down; and gave her his oath, that if she\r\nwould speak the real truth, he would excuse her from punishment; but\r\nthat if she concealed any thing, he would have her body torn to pieces\r\nby torments, and leave no part of it to be buried.\r\n\r\n6. Upon this the woman paused a little, and then said, \"Why do I spare\r\nto speak of these grand secrets, now Pheroras is dead? that would only\r\ntend to save Antipater, who is all our destruction. Hear then, O king,\r\nand be thou, and God himself, who cannot be deceived, witnesses to the\r\ntruth of what I am going to say. When thou didst sit weeping by Pheroras\r\nas he was dying,\" then it was that he called me to him, and said, \"My\r\ndear wife, I have been greatly mistaken as to the disposition of my\r\nbrother towards me, and have hated him that is so affectionate to me,\r\nand have contrived to kill him who is in such disorder for me before I\r\nam dead. As for myself, I receive the recompence of my impiety; but do\r\nthou bring what poison was left with us by Antipater, and which thou\r\nkeepest in order to destroy him, and consume it immediately in the fire\r\nin my sight, that I may not be liable to the avenger in the invisible\r\nworld.\" This I brought as he bid me, and emptied the greatest part of\r\nit into the fire, but reserved a little of it for my own use against\r\nuncertain futurity, and out of my fear of thee.\r\n\r\n7. When she had said this, she brought the box, which had a small\r\nquantity of this potion in it: but the king let her alone, and\r\ntransferred the tortures to Antiphilus's mother and brother; who both\r\nconfessed that Antiphilus brought the box out of Egypt, and that they\r\nhad received the potion from a brother of his, who was a physician at\r\nAlexandria. Then did the ghosts of Alexander and Aristobulus go round\r\nall the palace, and became the inquisitors and discoverers of what could\r\nnot otherwise have been found out and brought such as were the freest\r\nfrom suspicion to be examined; whereby it was discovered that Mariamne,\r\nthe high priest's daughter, was conscious of this plot; and her very\r\nbrothers, when they were tortured, declared it so to be. Whereupon\r\nthe king avenged this insolent attempt of the mother upon her son, and\r\nblotted Herod, whom he had by her, out of his tretament, who had been\r\nbefore named therein as successor to Antipater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Antipater Is Convicted By Bathyllus; But He Still Returns\r\n     From Rome Without Knowing It. Herod Brings Him To His Trial.\r\n\r\n1. After these things were over, Bathyllus came under examination, in\r\norder to convict Antipater, who proved the concluding attestation to\r\nAntipater's designs; for indeed he was no other than his freed-man. This\r\nman came, and brought another deadly potion, the poison of asps, and\r\nthe juices of other serpents, that if the first potion did not do the\r\nbusiness, Pheroras and his wife might be armed with this also to destroy\r\nthe king. He brought also an addition to Antipater's insolent attempt\r\nagainst his father, which was the letters which he wrote against his\r\nbrethren, Archelaus and Philip, which were the king's sons, and educated\r\nat Rome, being yet youths, but of generous dispositions. Antipater set\r\nhimself to get rid of these as soon as he could, that they might not be\r\nprejudicial to his hopes; and to that end he forged letters against them\r\nin the name of his friends at Rome. Some of these he corrupted by bribes\r\nto write how they grossly reproached their father, and did openly bewail\r\nAlexander and Aristobulus, and were uneasy at their being recalled; for\r\ntheir father had already sent for them, which was the very thing that\r\ntroubled Antipater.\r\n\r\n2. Nay, indeed, while Antipater was in Judea, and before he was upon\r\nhis journey to Rome, he gave money to have the like letters against them\r\nsent from Rome, and then came to his father, who as yet had no suspicion\r\nof him, and apologized for his brethren, and alleged on their behalf\r\nthat some of the things contained in those letters were false, and\r\nothers of them were only youthful errors. Yet at the same time that he\r\nexpended a great deal of his money, by making presents to such as wrote\r\nagainst his brethren, did he aim to bring his accounts into confusion,\r\nby buying costly garments, and carpets of various contextures, with\r\nsilver and gold cups, and a great many more curious things, that so,\r\namong the view great expenses laid out upon such furniture, he might\r\nconceal the money he had used in hiring men [to write the letters];\r\nfor he brought in an account of his expenses, amounting to two hundred\r\ntalents, his main pretense for which was file law-suit he had been in\r\nwith Sylleus. So while all his rogueries, even those of a lesser sort\r\nalso, were covered by his greater villainy, while all the examinations\r\nby torture proclaimed his attempt to murder his father, and the letters\r\nproclaimed his second attempt to murder his brethren; yet did no one of\r\nthose that came to Rome inform him of his misfortunes in Judea, although\r\nseven months had intervened between his conviction and his return, so\r\ngreat was the hatred which they all bore to him. And perhaps they were\r\nthe ghosts of those brethren of his that had been murdered that stopped\r\nthe mouths of those that intended to have told him. He then wrote from\r\nRome, and informed his [friends] that he would soon come to them, and\r\nhow he was dismissed with honor by Caesar.\r\n\r\n3. Now the king, being desirous to get this plotter against him into\r\nhis hands, and being also afraid lest he should some way come to the\r\nknowledge how his affairs stood, and be upon his guard, he dissembled\r\nhis anger in his epistle to him, as in other points he wrote kindly to\r\nhim, and desired him to make haste, because if he came quickly, he would\r\nthen lay aside the complaints he had against his mother; for Antipater\r\nwas not ignorant that his mother had been expelled out of the palace.\r\nHowever, he had before received a letter, which contained an account of\r\nthe death of Pheroras, at Tarentum, 46 and made great lamentations at\r\nit; for which some commended him, as being for his own uncle; though\r\nprobably this confusion arose on account of his having thereby failed in\r\nhis plot [on his father's life]; and his tears were more for the loss\r\nof him that was to have been subservient therein, than for [an uncle]\r\nPheroras: moreover, a sort of fear came upon him as to his designs, lest\r\nthe poison should have been discovered. However, when he was in Cilicia,\r\nhe received the forementioned epistle from his father, and made great\r\nhaste accordingly. But when he had sailed to Celenderis, a suspicion\r\ncame into his mind relating to his mother's misfortunes; as if his soul\r\nforeboded some mischief to itself. Those therefore of his friends which\r\nwere the most considerate advised him not rashly to go to his father,\r\ntill he had learned what were the occasions why his mother had been\r\nejected, because they were afraid that he might be involved in the\r\ncalumnies that had been cast upon his mother: but those that were less\r\nconsiderate, and had more regard to their own desires of seeing their\r\nnative country, than to Antipater's safety, persuaded him to make haste\r\nhome, and not, by delaying his journey, afford his father ground for an\r\nill suspicion, and give a handle to those that raised stories against\r\nhim; for that in case any thing had been moved to his disadvantage, it\r\nwas owing to his absence, which durst not have been done had he been\r\npresent. And they said it was absurd to deprive himself of certain\r\nhappiness, for the sake of an uncertain suspicion, and not rather to\r\nreturn to his father, and take the royal authority upon him, which was\r\nin a state of fluctuation on his account only. Antipater complied with\r\nthis last advice, for Providence hurried him on [to his destruction]. So\r\nhe passed over the sea, and landed at Sebastus, the haven of Cesarea.\r\n\r\n4. And here he found a perfect and unexpected solitude, while ever body\r\navoided him, and nobody durst come at him; for he was equally hated by\r\nall men; and now that hatred had liberty to show itself, and the dread\r\nmen were in at the king's anger made men keep from him; for the whole\r\ncity [of Jerusalem] was filled with the rumors about Antipater, and\r\nAntipater himself was the only person who was ignorant of them; for as\r\nno man was dismissed more magnificently when he began his voyage to Rome\r\nso was no man now received back with greater ignominy. And indeed he\r\nbegan already to suspect what misfortunes there were in Herod's family;\r\nyet did he cunningly conceal his suspicion; and while he was inwardly\r\nready to die for fear, he put on a forced boldness of countenance. Nor\r\ncould he now fly any whither, nor had he any way of emerging out of the\r\ndifficulties which encompassed him; nor indeed had he even there any\r\ncertain intelligence of the affairs of the royal family, by reason\r\nof the threats the king had given out: yet had he some small hopes\r\nof better tidings; for perhaps nothing had been discovered; or if any\r\ndiscovery had been made, perhaps he should be able to clear himself by\r\nimpudence and artful tricks, which were the only things he relied upon\r\nfor his deliverance.\r\n\r\n5. And with these hopes did he screen himself, till he came to the\r\npalace, without any friends with him; for these were affronted, and shut\r\nout at the first gate. Now Varus, the president of Syria, happened to\r\nbe in the palace [at this juncture]; so Antipater went in to his father,\r\nand, putting on a bold face, he came near to salute him. But Herod\r\nStretched out his hands, and turned his head away from him, and cried\r\nout, \"Even this is an indication of a parricide, to be desirous to\r\nget me into his arms, when he is under such heinous accusations. God\r\nconfound thee, thou vile wretch; do not thou touch me, till thou hast\r\ncleared thyself of these crimes that are charged upon thee. I appoint\r\nthee a court where thou art to be judged, and this Varus, who is very\r\nseasonably here, to be thy judge; and get thou thy defense ready against\r\ntomorrow, for I give thee so much time to prepare suitable excuses for\r\nthyself.\" And as Antipater was so confounded, that he was able to make\r\nno answer to this charge, he went away; but his mother and wife came\r\nto him, and told him of all the evidence they had gotten against him.\r\nHereupon he recollected himself, and considered what defense he should\r\nmake against the accusations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Antipater Is Accused Before Varus, And Is Convicted Of\r\n     Laying A Plot [Against His Father] By The Strongest\r\n     Evidence. Herod Puts Off His Punishment Till He Should Be\r\n     Recovered, And In The Mean Time Alters His Testament.\r\n\r\n1. Now the day following the king assembled a court of his kinsmen and\r\nfriends, and called in Antipater's friends also. Herod himself, with\r\nVarus, were the presidents; and Herod called for all the witnesses, and\r\nordered them to be brought in; among whom some of the domestic servants\r\nof Antipater's mother were brought in also, who had but a little while\r\nbefore been caught, as they were carrying the following letter from her\r\nto her son: \"Since all those things have been already discovered to\r\nthy father, do not thou come to him, unless thou canst procure some\r\nassistance from Caesar.\" When this and the other witnesses were\r\nintroduced, Antipater came in, and falling on his face before his\r\nfather's feet, he said, \"Father, I beseech thee, do not condemn me\r\nbeforehand, but let thy ears be unbiassed, and attend to my defense; for\r\nif thou wilt give me leave, I will demonstrate that I am innocent.\"\r\n\r\n2. Hereupon Herod cried out to him to hold his peace, and spake thus\r\nto Varus: \"I cannot but think that thou, Varus, and every other upright\r\njudge, will determine that Antipater is a vile wretch. I am also afraid\r\nthat thou wilt abhor my ill fortune, and judge me also myself worthy\r\nof all sorts of calamity for begetting such children; while yet I ought\r\nrather to be pitied, who have been so affectionate a father to such\r\nwretched sons; for when I had settled the kingdom on my former sons,\r\neven when they were young, and when, besides the charges of their\r\neducation at Rome, I had made them the friends of Caesar, and made them\r\nenvied by other kings, I found them plotting against me. These have been\r\nput to death, and that, in great measure, for the sake of Antipater;\r\nfor as he was then young, and appointed to be my successor, I took care\r\nchiefly to secure him from danger: but this profligate wild beast, when\r\nhe had been over and above satiated with that patience which I showed\r\nhim, he made use of that abundance I had given him against myself; for I\r\nseemed to him to live too long, and he was very uneasy at the old age\r\nI was arrived at; nor could he stay any longer, but would be a king by\r\nparricide. And justly I am served by him for bringing him back out of\r\nthe country to court, when he was of no esteem before, and for thrusting\r\nout those sons of mine that were born of the queen, and for making him a\r\nsuccessor to my dominions. I confess to thee, O Varus, the great folly I\r\nwas guilty for I provoked those sons of mine to act against me, and cut\r\noff their just expectations for the sake of Antipater; and indeed what\r\nkindness did I do them; that could equal what I have done to Antipater?\r\nto I have, in a manner, yielded up my royal while I am alive, and whom I\r\nhave openly named for the successor to my dominions in my testament, and\r\ngiven him a yearly revenue of his own of fifty talents, and supplied him\r\nwith money to an extravagant degree out of my own revenue; and' when\r\nhe was about to sail to Rome, I gave him three talents, and recommended\r\nhim, and him alone of all my children, to Caesar, as his father's\r\ndeliverer. Now what crimes were those other sons of mine guilty of like\r\nthese of Antipater? and what evidence was there brought against them so\r\nstrong as there is to demonstrate this son to have plotted against\r\nme? Yet does this parricide presume to speak for himself, and hopes\r\nto obscure the truth by his cunning tricks. Thou, O Varus, must guard\r\nthyself against him; for I know the wild beast, and I foresee how\r\nplausibly he will talk, and his counterfeit lamentation. This was he who\r\nexhorted me to have a care of Alexander when he was alive, and not to\r\nintrust my body with all men! This was he who came to my very bed, and\r\nlooked about lest any one should lay snares for me! This was he who took\r\ncare of my sleep, and secured me from fear of danger, who comforted me\r\nunder the trouble I was in upon the slaughter of my sons, and looked to\r\nsee what affection my surviving brethren bore me! This was my protector,\r\nand the guardian of my body! And when I call to mind, O Varus, his\r\ncraftiness upon every occasion, and his art of dissembling, I can hardly\r\nbelieve that I am still alive, and I wonder how I have escaped such a\r\ndeep plotter of mischief. However, since some fate or other makes my\r\nhouse desolate, and perpetually raises up those that are dearest to me\r\nagainst me, I will, with tears, lament my hard fortune, and privately\r\ngroan under my lonesome condition; yet am I resolved that no one who\r\nthirsts after my blood shall escape punishment, although the evidence\r\nshould extend itself to all my sons.\"\r\n\r\n3. Upon Herod's saying this, he was interrupted by the confusion he was\r\nin; but ordered Nicolaus, one of his friends, to produce the evidence\r\nagainst Antipater. But in the mean time Antipater lifted up his head,\r\n[for he lay on the ground before his father's feet,] and cried out\r\naloud, \"Thou, O father, hast made my apology for me; for how can I be\r\na parricide, whom thou thyself confessest to have always had for\r\nthy guardian? Thou callest my filial affection prodigious lies and\r\nhypocrisy! how then could it be that I, who was so subtle in other\r\nmatters, should here be so mad as not to understand that it was not easy\r\nthat he who committed so horrid a crime should be concealed from men,\r\nbut impossible that he should be concealed from the Judge of heaven, who\r\nsees all things, and is present every where? or did not I know what end\r\nmy brethren came to, on whom God inflicted so great a punishment for\r\ntheir evil designs against thee? And indeed what was there that could\r\npossibly provoke me against thee? Could the hope of being king do it?\r\nI was a king already. Could I suspect hatred from thee? No. Was not I\r\nbeloved by thee? And what other fear could I have? Nay, by preserving\r\nthee safe, I was a terror to others. Did I want money? No; for who was\r\nable to expend so much as myself? Indeed, father, had I been the most\r\nexecrable of all mankind, and had I had the soul of the most cruel\r\nwild beast, must I not have been overcome with the benefits thou hadst\r\nbestowed upon me? whom, as thou thyself sayest, thou broughtest [into\r\nthe palace]; whom thou didst prefer before so many of thy sons; whom\r\nthou madest a king in thine own lifetime, and, by the vast magnitude of\r\nthe other advantages thou bestowedst on me, thou madest me an object of\r\nenvy. O miserable man! that thou shouldst undergo this bitter absence,\r\nand thereby afford a great opportunity for envy to arise against thee,\r\nand a long space for such as were laying designs against thee! Yet was\r\nI absent, father, on thy affairs, that Sylleus might not treat thee with\r\ncontempt in thine old age. Rome is a witness to my filial affection, and\r\nso is Caesar, the ruler of the habitable earth, who oftentimes called me\r\nPhilopater. 47 Take here the letters he hath sent thee, they are more\r\nto be believed than the calumnies raised here; these letters are my only\r\napology; these I use as the demonstration of that natural affection I\r\nhave to thee. Remember that it was against my own choice that I sailed\r\n[to Rome], as knowing the latent hatred that was in the kingdom against\r\nme. It was thou, O father, however unwillingly, who hast been my ruin,\r\nby forcing me to allow time for calumnies against me, and envy at me.\r\nHowever, I am come hither, and am ready to hear the evidence there\r\nis against me. If I be a parricide, I have passed by land and by sea,\r\nwithout suffering any misfortune on either of them: but this method of\r\ntrial is no advantage to me; for it seems, O father, that I am already\r\ncondemned, both before God and before thee; and as I am already\r\ncondemned, I beg that thou wilt not believe the others that have been\r\ntortured, but let fire be brought to torment me; let the racks march\r\nthrough my bowels; have no regard to any lamentations that this polluted\r\nbody can make; for if I be a parricide, I ought not to die without\r\ntorture.\" Thus did Antipater cry out with lamentation and weeping, and\r\nmoved all the rest, and Varus in particular, to commiserate his case.\r\nHerod was the only person whose passion was too strong to permit him to\r\nweep, as knowing that the testimonies against him were true.\r\n\r\n4. And now it was that, at the king's command, Nicolaus, when he\r\nhad premised a great deal about the craftiness of Antipater, and had\r\nprevented the effects of their commiseration to him, afterwards\r\nbrought in a bitter and large accusation against him, ascribing all\r\nthe wickedness that had been in the kingdom to him, and especially the\r\nmurder of his brethren; and demonstrated that they had perished by the\r\ncalumnies he had raised against them. He also said that he had laid\r\ndesigns against them that were still alive, as if they were laying plots\r\nfor the succession; and [said he] how can it be supposed that he who\r\nprepared poison for his father should abstain from mischief as to his\r\nbrethren? He then proceeded to convict him of the attempt to poison\r\nHerod, and gave an account in order of the several discoveries that\r\nhad been made; and had great indignation as to the affair of Pheroras,\r\nbecause Antipater had been for making him murder his brother, and had\r\ncorrupted those that were dearest to the king, and filled the whole\r\npalace with wickedness; and when he had insisted on many other\r\naccusations, and the proofs for them, he left off.\r\n\r\n5. Then Varus bid Antipater make his defense; but he lay along in\r\nsilence, and said no more but this, \"God is my witness that I am\r\nentirely innocent.\" So Varus asked for the potion, and gave it to be\r\ndrunk by a condemned malefactor, who was then in prison, who died upon\r\nthe spot. So Varus, when he had had a very private discourse with Herod,\r\nand had written an account of this assembly to Caesar, went away, after\r\na day's stay. The king also bound Antipater, and sent away to inform\r\nCaesar of his misfortunes.\r\n\r\n6. Now after this it was discovered that Antipater had laid a plot\r\nagainst Salome also; for one of Antiphilus's domestic servants came,\r\nand brought letters from Rome, from a maid-servant of Julia, [Caesar's\r\nwife,] whose name was Acme. By her a message was sent to the king, that\r\nshe had found a letter written by Salome, among Julia's papers, and had\r\nsent it to him privately, out of her good-will to him. This letter of\r\nSalome contained the most bitter reproaches of the king, and the highest\r\naccusations against him. Antipater had forged this letter, and had\r\ncorrupted Acme, and persuaded her to send it to Herod. This was proved\r\nby her letter to Antipater, for thus did this woman write to him: \"As\r\nthou desirest, I have written a letter to thy father, and have sent that\r\nletter, and am persuaded that the king will not spare his sister when he\r\nreads it. Thou wilt do well to remember what thou hast promised when all\r\nis accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n7. When this epistle was discovered, and what the epistle forged against\r\nSalome contained, a suspicion came into the king's mind, that perhaps\r\nthe letters against Alexander were also forged: he was moreover greatly\r\ndisturbed, and in a passion, because he had almost slain his sister on\r\nAntipater's account. He did no longer delay therefore to bring him\r\nto punishment for all his crimes; yet when he was eagerly pursuing\r\nAntipater, he was restrained by a severe distemper he fell into.\r\nHowever, he sent all account to Caesar about Acme, and the contrivances\r\nagainst Salome; he sent also for his testament, and altered it, and\r\ntherein made Antipas king, as taking no care of Archelaus and Philip,\r\nbecause Antipater had blasted their reputations with him; but he\r\nbequeathed to Caesar, besides other presents that he gave him, a\r\nthousand talents; as also to his wife, and children, and friends, and\r\nfreed-men about five hundred: he also bequeathed to all others a great\r\nquantity of land, and of money, and showed his respects to Salome\r\nhis sister, by giving her most splendid gifts. And this was what was\r\ncontained in his testament, as it was now altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Golden Eagle Is Cut To Pieces. Herod's Barbarity When He\r\n     Was Ready To Die. He Attempts To Kill Himself. He Commands\r\n     Antipater To Be Slain. He Survives Him Five Days And Then\r\n     Dies.\r\n\r\n1. Now Herod's distemper became more and more severe to him, and this\r\nbecause these his disorders fell upon him in his old age, and when he\r\nwas in a melancholy condition; for he was already seventy years of age,\r\nand had been brought by the calamities that happened to him about\r\nhis children, whereby he had no pleasure in life, even when he was in\r\nhealth; the grief also that Antipater was still alive aggravated his\r\ndisease, whom he resolved to put to death now not at random, but as soon\r\nas he should be well again, and resolved to have him slain [in a public\r\nmanner].\r\n\r\n2. There also now happened to him, among his other calamities, a\r\ncertain popular sedition. There were two men of learning in the city\r\n[Jerusalem,] who were thought the most skillful in the laws of their\r\ncountry, and were on that account had in very great esteem all over the\r\nnation; they were, the one Judas, the son of Sepphoris, and the other\r\nMatthias, the son of Margalus. There was a great concourse of the young\r\nmen to these men when they expounded the laws, and there got together\r\nevery day a kind of an army of such as were growing up to be men.\r\nNow when these men were informed that the king was wearing away\r\nwith melancholy, and with a distemper, they dropped words to their\r\nacquaintance, how it was now a very proper time to defend the cause\r\nof God, and to pull down what had been erected contrary to the laws of\r\ntheir country; for it was unlawful there should be any such thing in\r\nthe temple as images, or faces, or the like representation of any animal\r\nwhatsoever. Now the king had put up a golden eagle over the great gate\r\nof the temple, which these learned men exhorted them to cut down; and\r\ntold them, that if there should any danger arise, it was a glorious\r\nthing to die for the laws of their country; because that the soul was\r\nimmortal, and that an eternal enjoyment of happiness did await such as\r\ndied on that account; while the mean-spirited, and those that were not\r\nwise enough to show a right love of their souls, preferred a death by a\r\ndisease, before that which is the result of a virtuous behavior.\r\n\r\n3. At the same time that these men made this speech to their disciples,\r\na rumor was spread abroad that the king was dying, which made the\r\nyoung men set about the work with greater boldness; they therefore let\r\nthemselves down from the top of the temple with thick cords, and this at\r\nmidday, and while a great number of people were in the temple, and cut\r\ndown that golden eagle with axes. This was presently told to the king's\r\ncaptain of the temple, who came running with a great body of soldiers,\r\nand caught about forty of the young men, and brought them to the king.\r\nAnd when he asked them, first of all, whether they had been so hardy as\r\nto cut down the golden eagle, they confessed they had done so; and when\r\nhe asked them by whose command they had done it, they replied, at the\r\ncommand of the law of their country; and when he further asked them how\r\nthey could be so joyful when they were to be put to death, they replied,\r\nbecause they should enjoy greater happiness after they were dead. 48\r\n\r\n4. At this the king was in such an extravagant passion, that he overcame\r\nhis disease [for the time,] and went out, and spake to the people;\r\nwherein he made a terrible accusation against those men, as being guilty\r\nof sacrilege, and as making greater attempts under pretense of their\r\nlaw, and he thought they deserved to be punished as impious persons.\r\nWhereupon the people were afraid lest a great number should be found\r\nguilty and desired that when he had first punished those that put them\r\nupon this work, and then those that were caught in it, he would leave\r\noff his anger as to the rest. With this the king complied, though not\r\nwithout difficulty, and ordered those that had let themselves down,\r\ntogether with their Rabbins, to be burnt alive, but delivered the rest\r\nthat were caught to the proper officers, to be put to death by them.\r\n\r\n5. After this, the distemper seized upon his whole body, and greatly\r\ndisordered all its parts with various symptoms; for there was a gentle\r\nfever upon him, and an intolerable itching over all the surface of his\r\nbody, and continual pains in his colon, and dropsical turnouts about\r\nhis feet, and an inflammation of the abdomen, and a putrefaction of his\r\nprivy member, that produced worms. Besides which he had a difficulty of\r\nbreathing upon him, and could not breathe but when he sat upright, and\r\nhad a convulsion of all his members, insomuch that the diviners said\r\nthose diseases were a punishment upon him for what he had done to the\r\nRabbins. Yet did he struggle with his numerous disorders, and still\r\nhad a desire to live, and hoped for recovery, and considered of several\r\nmethods of cure. Accordingly, he went over Jordan, and made use of those\r\nhot baths at Callirrhoe, which ran into the lake Asphaltites, but are\r\nthemselves sweet enough to be drunk. And here the physicians thought\r\nproper to bathe his whole body in warm oil, by letting it down into a\r\nlarge vessel full of oil; whereupon his eyes failed him, and he came and\r\nwent as if he was dying; and as a tumult was then made by his servants,\r\nat their voice he revived again. Yet did he after this despair of\r\nrecovery, and gave orders that each soldier should have fifty drachmae\r\na-piece, and that his commanders and friends should have great sums of\r\nmoney given them.\r\n\r\n6. He then returned back and came to Jericho, in such a melancholy state\r\nof body as almost threatened him with present death, when he proceeded\r\nto attempt a horrid wickedness; for he got together the most illustrious\r\nmen of the whole Jewish nation, out of every village, into a place\r\ncalled the Hippodrome, and there shut them in. He then called for his\r\nsister Salome, and her husband Alexas, and made this speech to them:\r\n\"I know well enough that the Jews will keep a festival upon my death\r\nhowever, it is in my power to be mourned for on other accounts, and to\r\nhave a splendid funeral, if you will but be subservient to my commands.\r\nDo you but take care to send soldiers to encompass these men that are\r\nnow in custody, and slay them immediately upon my death, and then all\r\nJudea, and every family of them, will weep at it, whether they will or\r\nno.\"\r\n\r\n7. These were the commands he gave them; when there came letters from\r\nhis ambassadors at Rome, whereby information was given that Acme was put\r\nto death at Caesar's command, and that Antipater was condemned to die;\r\nhowever, they wrote withal, that if Herod had a mind rather to banish\r\nhim, Caesar permitted him so to do. So he for a little while revived,\r\nand had a desire to live; but presently after he was overborne by his\r\npains, and was disordered by want of food, and by a convulsive cough,\r\nand endeavored to prevent a natural, death; so he took an apple, and\r\nasked for a knife for he used to pare apples and eat them; he then\r\nlooked round about to see that there was nobody to hinder him, and lift\r\nup his right hand as if he would stab himself; but Achiabus, his first\r\ncousin, came running to him, and held his hand, and hindered him from\r\nso doing; on which occasion a very great lamentation was made in the\r\npalace, as if the king were expiring. As soon as ever Antipater heard\r\nthat, he took courage, and with joy in his looks, besought his keepers,\r\nfor a sum of money, to loose him and let him go; but the principal\r\nkeeper of the prison did not only obstruct him in that his intention,\r\nbut ran and told the king what his design was; hereupon the king cried\r\nout louder than his distemper would well bear, and immediately sent some\r\nof his guards and slew Antipater; he also gave order to have him\r\nburied at Hyrcanium, and altered his testament again, and therein made\r\nArchelaus, his eldest son, and the brother of Antipas, his successor,\r\nand made Antipas tetrarch.\r\n\r\n8. So Herod, having survived the slaughter of his son five days, died,\r\nhaving reigned thirty-four years since he had caused Antigonus to be\r\nslain, and obtained his kingdom; but thirty-seven years since he had\r\nbeen made king by the Romans. Now as for his fortune, it was prosperous\r\nin all other respects, if ever any other man could be so, since, from a\r\nprivate man, he obtained the kingdom, and kept it so long, and left\r\nit to his own sons; but still in his domestic affairs he was a most\r\nunfortunate man. Now, before the soldiers knew of his death, Salome and\r\nher husband came out and dismissed those that were in bonds, whom the\r\nking had commanded to be slain, and told them that he had altered his\r\nmind, and would have every one of them sent to their own homes. When\r\nthese men were gone, Salome, told the soldiers [the king was dead], and\r\ngot them and the rest of the multitude together to an assembly, in the\r\namphitheater at Jericho, where Ptolemy, who was intrusted by the king\r\nwith his signet ring, came before them, and spake of the happiness the\r\nking had attained, and comforted the multitude, and read the epistle\r\nwhich had been left for the soldiers, wherein he earnestly exhorted them\r\nto bear good-will to his successor; and after he had read the epistle,\r\nhe opened and read his testament, wherein Philip was to inherit\r\nTrachonitis, and the neighboring countries, and Antipas was to be\r\ntetrarch, as we said before, and Archelaus was made king. He had also\r\nbeen commanded to carry Herod's ring to Caesar, and the settlements\r\nhe had made, sealed up, because Caesar was to be lord of all the\r\nsettlements he had made, and was to confirm his testament; and he\r\nordered that the dispositions he had made were to be kept as they were\r\nin his former testament.\r\n\r\n9. So there was an acclamation made to Archelaus, to congratulate him\r\nupon his advancement; and the soldiers, with the multitude, went round\r\nabout in troops, and promised him their good-will, and besides, prayed\r\nGod to bless his government. After this, they betook themselves to\r\nprepare for the king's funeral; and Archelaus omitted nothing of\r\nmagnificence therein, but brought out all the royal ornaments to augment\r\nthe pomp of the deceased. There was a bier all of gold, embroidered with\r\nprecious stones, and a purple bed of various contexture, with the dead\r\nbody upon it, covered with purple; and a diadem was put upon his head,\r\nand a crown of gold above it, and a sceptre in his right hand; and near\r\nto the bier were Herod's sons, and a multitude of his kindred; next to\r\nwhich came his guards, and the regiment of Thracians, the Germans also\r\nand Gauls, all accounted as if they were going to war; but the rest of\r\nthe army went foremost, armed, and following their captains and officers\r\nin a regular manner; after whom five hundred of his domestic servants\r\nand freed-men followed, with sweet spices in their hands: and the body\r\nwas carried two hundred furlongs, to Herodium, where he had given order\r\nto be buried. And this shall suffice for the conclusion of the life of\r\nHerod.\r\n\r\nWAR BOOK 1 FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ I see little difference in the several accounts in Josephus\r\nabout the Egyptian temple Onion, of which large complaints are made by\r\nhis commentators.

After Which A Great Tumult Is Raised By\r\n     The Multitude And He Sends The Soldiers Out Upon Them, Who\r\n     Destroy About Three Thousand Of Them.\r\n\r\n1. Now the necessity which Archelaus was under of taking a journey to\r\nRome was the occasion of new disturbances; for when he had mourned for\r\nhis father seven days, 1 and had given a very expensive funeral feast to\r\nthe multitude, [which custom is the occasion of poverty to many of the\r\nJews, because they are forced to feast the multitude; for if any one\r\nomits it, he is not esteemed a holy person,] he put on a white garment,\r\nand went up to the temple, where the people accosted him with various\r\nacclamations. He also spake kindly to the multitude from an elevated\r\nseat and a throne of gold, and returned them thanks for the zeal they\r\nhad shown about his father's funeral, and the submission they had made\r\nto him, as if he were already settled in the kingdom; but he told them\r\nwithal, that he would not at present take upon him either the authority\r\nof a king, or the names thereto belonging, until Caesar, who is made\r\nlord of this whole affair by the testament, confirm the succession; for\r\nthat when the soldiers would have set the diadem on his head at Jericho,\r\nhe would not accept of it; but that he would make abundant requitals,\r\nnot to the soldiers only, but to the people, for their alacrity and\r\ngood-will to him, when the superior lords [the Romans] should have given\r\nhim a complete title to the kingdom; for that it should be his study to\r\nappear in all things better than his father.\r\n\r\n2. Upon this the multitude were pleased, and presently made a trial of\r\nwhat he intended, by asking great things of him; for some made a clamor\r\nthat he would ease them in their taxes; others, that he would take off\r\nthe duties upon commodities; and some, that he would loose those\r\nthat were in prison; in all which cases he answered readily to their\r\nsatisfaction, in order to get the good-will of the multitude; after\r\nwhich he offered [the proper] sacrifices, and feasted with his friends.\r\nAnd here it was that a great many of those that desired innovations\r\ncame in crowds towards the evening, and began then to mourn on their own\r\naccount, when the public mourning for the king was over. These lamented\r\nthose that were put to death by Herod, because they had cut down the\r\ngolden eagle that had been over the gate of the temple. Nor was this\r\nmourning of a private nature, but the lamentations were very great, the\r\nmourning solemn, and the weeping such as was loudly heard all over the\r\ncity, as being for those men who had perished for the laws of their\r\ncountry, and for the temple. They cried out that a punishment ought to\r\nbe inflicted for these men upon those that were honored by Herod; and\r\nthat, in the first place, the man whom he had made high priest should\r\nbe deprived; and that it was fit to choose a person of greater piety and\r\npurity than he was.\r\n\r\n3. At these clamors Archelaus was provoked, but restrained himself from\r\ntaking vengeance on the authors, on account of the haste he was in of\r\ngoing to Rome, as fearing lest, upon his making war on the multitude,\r\nsuch an action might detain him at home. Accordingly, he made trial to\r\nquiet the innovators by persuasion, rather than by force, and sent his\r\ngeneral in a private way to them, and by him exhorted them to be quiet.\r\nBut the seditious threw stones at him, and drove him away, as he came\r\ninto the temple, and before he could say any thing to them. The like\r\ntreatment they showed to others, who came to them after him, many of\r\nwhich were sent by Archelaus, in order to reduce them to sobriety, and\r\nthese answered still on all occasions after a passionate manner; and it\r\nopenly appeared that they would not be quiet, if their numbers were but\r\nconsiderable. And indeed, at the feast of unleavened bread, which was\r\nnow at hand, and is by the Jews called the Passover, and used to be\r\ncelebrated with a great number of sacrifices, an innumerable multitude\r\nof the people came out of the country to worship; some of these stood\r\nin the temple bewailing the Rabbins [that had been put to death],\r\nand procured their sustenance by begging, in order to support their\r\nsedition. At this Archelaus was affrighted, and privately sent a\r\ntribune, with his cohort of soldiers, upon them, before the disease\r\nshould spread over the whole multitude, and gave orders that they should\r\nconstrain those that began the tumult, by force, to be quiet. At these\r\nthe whole multitude were irritated, and threw stones at many of the\r\nsoldiers, and killed them; but the tribune fled away wounded, and had\r\nmuch ado to escape so. After which they betook themselves to their\r\nsacrifices, as if they had done no mischief; nor did it appear to\r\nArchelaus that the multitude could be restrained without bloodshed; so\r\nhe sent his whole army upon them, the footmen in great multitudes, by\r\nthe way of the city, and the horsemen by the way of the plain, who,\r\nfalling upon them on the sudden, as they were offering their sacrifices,\r\ndestroyed about three thousand of them; but the rest of the multitude\r\nwere dispersed upon the adjoining mountains: these were followed by\r\nArchelaus's heralds, who commanded every one to retire to their own\r\nhomes, whither they all went, and left the festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Archelaus Goes To Rome With A Great Number Of His Kindred.\r\n     He Is There Accused Before Caesar By Antipater; But Is\r\n     Superior To His Accusers In Judgment By The Means Of That\r\n     Defense Which Nicolaus Made For Him.\r\n\r\n1. Archelaus went down now to the sea-side, with his mother and his\r\nfriends, Poplas, and Ptolemy, and Nicolaus, and left behind him Philip,\r\nto be his steward in the palace, and to take care of his domestic\r\naffairs. Salome went also along with him with her sons, as did also the\r\nking's brethren and sons-in-law. These, in appearance, went to give him\r\nall the assistance they were able, in order to secure his succession,\r\nbut in reality to accuse him for his breach of the laws by what he had\r\ndone at the temple.\r\n\r\n2. But as they were come to Cesarea, Sabinus, the procurator of Syria,\r\nmet them; he was going up to Judea, to secure Herod's effects; but\r\nVarus, [president of Syria,] who was come thither, restrained him from\r\ngoing any farther. This Varus Archelaus had sent for, by the earnest\r\nentreaty of Ptolemy. At this time, indeed, Sabinus, to gratify Varus,\r\nneither went to the citadels, nor did he shut up the treasuries where\r\nhis father's money was laid up, but promised that he would lie still,\r\nuntil Caesar should have taken cognizance of the affair. So he abode at\r\nCesarea; but as soon as those that were his hinderance were gone,\r\nwhen Varus was gone to Antioch, and Archelaus was sailed to Rome, he\r\nimmediately went on to Jerusalem, and seized upon the palace. And when\r\nhe had called for the governors of the citadels, and the stewards [of\r\nthe king's private affairs], he tried to sift out the accounts of the\r\nmoney, and to take possession of the citadels. But the governors of\r\nthose citadels were not unmindful of the commands laid upon them by\r\nArchelaus, and continued to guard them, and said the custody of them\r\nrather belonged to Caesar than to Archelaus.\r\n\r\n3. In the mean time, Antipas went also to Rome, to strive for the\r\nkingdom, and to insist that the former testament, wherein he was named\r\nto be king, was valid before the latter testament. Salome had also\r\npromised to assist him, as had many of Archelaus's kindred, who sailed\r\nalong with Archelaus himself also. He also carried along with him his\r\nmother, and Ptolemy, the brother of Nicolaus, who seemed one of great\r\nweight, on account of the great trust Herod put in him, he having been\r\none of his most honored friends. However, Antipas depended chiefly\r\nupon Ireneus, the orator; upon whose authority he had rejected such as\r\nadvised him to yield to Archelaus, because he was his elder brother, and\r\nbecause the second testament gave the kingdom to him. The inclinations\r\nalso of all Archelaus's kindred, who hated him, were removed to Antipas,\r\nwhen they came to Rome; although in the first place every one rather\r\ndesired to live under their own laws [without a king], and to be under\r\na Roman governor; but if they should fail in that point, these desired\r\nthat Antipas might be their king.\r\n\r\n4. Sabinus did also afford these his assistance to the same purpose by\r\nletters he sent, wherein he accused Archelaus before Caesar, and highly\r\ncommended Antipas. Salome also, and those with her, put the crimes which\r\nthey accused Archelaus of in order, and put them into Caesar's hands;\r\nand after they had done that, Archelaus wrote down the reasons of his\r\nclaim, and, by Ptolemy, sent in his father's ring, and his father's\r\naccounts. And when Caesar had maturely weighed by himself what both had\r\nto allege for themselves, as also had considered of the great burden of\r\nthe kingdom, and largeness of the revenues, and withal the number of the\r\nchildren Herod had left behind him, and had moreover read the letters he\r\nhad received from Varus and Sabinus on this occasion, he assembled the\r\nprincipal persons among the Romans together, [in which assembly Caius,\r\nthe son of Agrippa, and his daughter Julias, but by himself adopted\r\nfor his own son, sat in the first seat,] and gave the pleaders leave to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n5. Then stood up Salome's son, Antipater, [who of all Archelaus's\r\nantagonists was the shrewdest pleader,] and accused him in the following\r\nspeech: That Archelaus did in words contend for the kingdom, but that\r\nin deeds he had long exercised royal authority, and so did but insult\r\nCaesar in desiring to be now heard on that account, since he had not\r\nstaid for his determination about the succession, and since he had\r\nsuborned certain persons, after Herod's death, to move for putting the\r\ndiadem upon his head; since he had set himself down in the throne, and\r\ngiven answers as a king, and altered the disposition of the army, and\r\ngranted to some higher dignities; that he had also complied in all\r\nthings with the people in the requests they had made to him as to their\r\nking, and had also dismissed those that had been put into bonds by his\r\nfather for most important reasons. Now, after all this, he desires the\r\nshadow of that royal authority, whose substance he had already seized to\r\nhimself, and so hath made Caesar lord, not of things, but of words. He\r\nalso reproached him further, that his mourning for his father was only\r\npretended, while he put on a sad countenance in the day time, but drank\r\nto great excess in the night; from which behavior, he said, the late\r\ndisturbance among the multitude came, while they had an indignation\r\nthereat. And indeed the purport of his whole discourse was to aggravate\r\nArchelaus's crime in slaying such a multitude about the temple, which\r\nmultitude came to the festival, but were barbarously slain in the midst\r\nof their own sacrifices; and he said there was such a vast number of\r\ndead bodies heaped together in the temple, as even a foreign war, that\r\nshould come upon them [suddenly], before it was denounced, could not\r\nhave heaped together. And he added, that it was the foresight his father\r\nhad of that his barbarity which made him never give him any hopes of the\r\nkingdom, but when his mind was more infirm than his body, and he was not\r\nable to reason soundly, and did not well know what was the character of\r\nthat son, whom in his second testament he made his successor; and this\r\nwas done by him at a time when he had no complaints to make of him whom\r\nhe had named before, when he was sound in body, and when his mind was\r\nfree from all passion. That, however, if any one should suppose Herod's\r\njudgment, when he was sick, was superior to that at another time, yet\r\nhad Archelaus forfeited his kingdom by his own behavior, and those his\r\nactions, which were contrary to the law, and to its disadvantage.\r\nOr what sort of a king will this man be, when he hath obtained the\r\ngovernment from Caesar, who hath slain so many before he hath obtained\r\nit!\r\n\r\n6. When Antipater had spoken largely to this purpose, and had produced a\r\ngreat number of Archelaus's kindred as witnesses, to prove every part of\r\nthe accusation, he ended his discourse. Then stood up Nicolaus to plead\r\nfor Archelaus. He alleged that the slaughter in the temple could not\r\nbe avoided; that those that were slain were become enemies not to\r\nArchelaus's kingdom, only, but to Caesar, who was to determine about\r\nhim. He also demonstrated that Archelaus's accusers had advised him\r\nto perpetrate other things of which he might have been accused. But he\r\ninsisted that the latter testament should, for this reason, above all\r\nothers, be esteemed valid, because Herod had therein appointed Caesar to\r\nbe the person who should confirm the succession; for he who showed such\r\nprudence as to recede from his own power, and yield it up to the lord\r\nof the world, cannot be supposed mistaken in his judgment about him\r\nthat was to be his heir; and he that so well knew whom to choose for\r\narbitrator of the succession could not be unacquainted with him whom he\r\nchose for his successor.\r\n\r\n7. When Nicolaus had gone through all he had to say, Archelaus came,\r\nand fell down before Caesar's knees, without any noise;--upon which he\r\nraised him up, after a very obliging manner, and declared that truly\r\nhe was worthy to succeed his father. However, he still made no firm\r\ndetermination in his case; but when he had dismissed those assessors\r\nthat had been with him that day, he deliberated by himself about the\r\nallegations which he had heard, whether it were fit to constitute any\r\nof those named in the testaments for Herod's successor, or whether the\r\ngovernment should be parted among all his posterity, and this because of\r\nthe number of those that seemed to stand in need of support therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Jews Fight A Great Battle With Sabinus's Soldiers, And A\r\n     Great Destruction Is Made At Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1. Now before Caesar had determined any thing about these affairs,\r\nMalthace, Arehelaus's mother, fell sick and died. Letters also were\r\nbrought out of Syria from Varus, about a revolt of the Jews. This was\r\nforeseen by Varus, who accordingly, after Archelaus was sailed, went\r\nup to Jerusalem to restrain the promoters of the sedition, since it was\r\nmanifest that the nation would not be at rest; so he left one of those\r\nlegions which he brought with him out of Syria in the city, and went\r\nhimself to Antioch. But Sabinus came, after he was gone, and gave them\r\nan occasion of making innovations; for he compelled the keepers of the\r\ncitadels to deliver them up to him, and made a bitter search after the\r\nking's money, as depending not only on the soldiers which were left by\r\nVarus, but on the multitude of his own servants, all which he armed and\r\nused as the instruments of his covetousness. Now when that feast, which\r\nwas observed after seven weeks, and which the Jews called Pentecost, [i.\r\ne. the 50th day,] was at hand, its name being taken from the number\r\nof the days [after the passover], the people got together, but not on\r\naccount of the accustomed Divine worship, but of the indignation they\r\nhad ['at the present state of affairs']. Wherefore an immense multitude\r\nran together, out of Galilee, and Idumea, and Jericho, and Perea, that\r\nwas beyond Jordan; but the people that naturally belonged to Judea\r\nitself were above the rest, both in number, and in the alacrity of the\r\nmen. So they distributed themselves into three parts, and pitched their\r\ncamps in three places; one at the north side of the temple, another at\r\nthe south side, by the Hippodrome, and the third part were at the palace\r\non the west. So they lay round about the Romans on every side, and\r\nbesieged them.\r\n\r\n2. Now Sabinus was affrighted, both at their multitude, and at their\r\ncourage, and sent messengers to Varus continually, and besought him to\r\ncome to his succor quickly; for that if he delayed, his legion would be\r\ncut to pieces. As for Sabinus himself, he got up to the highest tower\r\nof the fortress, which was called Phasaelus; it is of the same name with\r\nHerod's brother, who was destroyed by the Parthians; and then he made\r\nsigns to the soldiers of that legion to attack the enemy; for his\r\nastonishment was so great, that he durst not go down to his own men.\r\nHereupon the soldiers were prevailed upon, and leaped out into the\r\ntemple, and fought a terrible battle with the Jews; in which, while\r\nthere were none over their heads to distress them, they were too hard\r\nfor them, by their skill, and the others' want of skill, in war; but\r\nwhen once many of the Jews had gotten up to the top of the cloisters,\r\nand threw their darts downwards, upon the heads of the Romans,\r\nthere were a great many of them destroyed. Nor was it easy to avenge\r\nthemselves upon those that threw their weapons from on high, nor was it\r\nmore easy for them to sustain those who came to fight them hand to hand.\r\n\r\n3. Since therefore the Romans were sorely afflicted by both these\r\ncircumstances, they set fire to the cloisters, which were works to be\r\nadmired, both on account of their magnitude and costliness. Whereupon\r\nthose that were above them were presently encompassed with the flame,\r\nand many of them perished therein; as many of them also were destroyed\r\nby the enemy, who came suddenly upon them; some of them also threw\r\nthemselves down from the walls backward, and some there were who, from\r\nthe desperate condition they were in, prevented the fire, by killing\r\nthemselves with their own swords; but so many of them as crept out from\r\nthe walls, and came upon the Romans, were easily mastered by them, by\r\nreason of the astonishment they were under; until at last some of the\r\nJews being destroyed, and others dispersed by the terror they were in,\r\nthe soldiers fell upon the treasure of God, which was now deserted, and\r\nplundered about four hundred talents, Of which sum Sabinus got together\r\nall that was not carried away by the soldiers.\r\n\r\n4. However, this destruction of the works [about the temple], and of the\r\nmen, occasioned a much greater number, and those of a more warlike sort,\r\nto get together, to oppose the Romans. These encompassed the palace\r\nround, and threatened to deploy all that were in it, unless they went\r\ntheir ways quickly; for they promised that Sabinus should come to no\r\nharm, if he would go out with his legion. There were also a great many\r\nof the king's party who deserted the Romans, and assisted the Jews; yet\r\ndid the most warlike body of them all, who were three thousand of the\r\nmen of Sebaste, go over to the Romans. Rufus also, and Gratus, their\r\ncaptains, did the same, [Gratus having the foot of the king's party\r\nunder him, and Rufus the horse,] each of whom, even without the forces\r\nunder them, were of great weight, on account of their strength and\r\nwisdom, which turn the scales in war. Now the Jews in the siege, and\r\ntried to break down walls of the fortress, and cried out to Sabinus and\r\nhis party, that they should go their ways, and not prove a hinderance to\r\nthem, now they hoped, after a long time, to recover that ancient liberty\r\nwhich their forefathers had enjoyed. Sabinus indeed was well contented\r\nto get out of the danger he was in, but he distrusted the assurances the\r\nJews gave him, and suspected such gentle treatment was but a bait laid\r\nas a snare for them: this consideration, together with the hopes he had\r\nof succor from Varus, made him bear the siege still longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Herod's Veteran Soldiers Become Tumultuous. The Robberies Of\r\n     Judas. Simon And Athronoeus Take The Name Of King Upon Them.\r\n\r\n1. At this time there were great disturbances in the country, and that\r\nin many places; and the opportunity that now offered itself induced a\r\ngreat many to set up for kings. And indeed in Idumea two thousand of\r\nHerod's veteran soldiers got together, and armed and fought against\r\nthose of the king's party; against whom Achiabus, the king's first\r\ncousin, fought, and that out of some of the places that were the most\r\nstrongly fortified; but so as to avoid a direct conflict with them in\r\nthe plains. In Sepphoris also, a city of Galilee, there was one Judas\r\n[the son of that arch-robber Hezekias, who formerly overran the country,\r\nand had been subdued by king Herod]; this man got no small multitude\r\ntogether, and brake open the place where the royal armor was laid up,\r\nand armed those about him, and attacked those that were so earnest to\r\ngain the dominion.\r\n\r\n2. In Perea also, Simon, one of the servants to the king, relying upon\r\nthe handsome appearance and tallness of his body, put a diadem upon his\r\nown head also; he also went about with a company of robbers that he had\r\ngotten together, and burnt down the royal palace that was at Jericho,\r\nand many other costly edifices besides, and procured himself very easily\r\nspoils by rapine, as snatching them out of the fire. And he had soon\r\nburnt down all the fine edifices, if Gratus, the captain of the foot\r\nof the king's party, had not taken the Trachonite archers, and the\r\nmost warlike of Sebaste, and met the man. His footmen were slain in the\r\nbattle in abundance; Gratus also cut to pieces Simon himself, as he was\r\nflying along a strait valley, when he gave him an oblique stroke upon\r\nhis neck, as he ran away, and brake it. The royal palaces that were\r\nnear Jordan at Betharamptha were also burnt down by some other of the\r\nseditious that came out of Perea.\r\n\r\n3. At this time it was that a certain shepherd ventured to set himself\r\nup for a king; he was called Athrongeus. It was his strength of body\r\nthat made him expect such a dignity, as well as his soul, which despised\r\ndeath; and besides these qualifications, he had four brethren like\r\nhimself. He put a troop of armed men under each of these his brethren,\r\nand made use of them as his generals and commanders, when he made his\r\nincursions, while he did himself act like a king, and meddled only with\r\nthe more important affairs; and at this time he put a diadem about his\r\nhead, and continued after that to overrun the country for no little time\r\nwith his brethren, and became their leader in killing both the Romans\r\nand those of the king's party; nor did any Jew escape him, if any gain\r\ncould accrue to him thereby. He once ventured to encompass a whole troop\r\nof Romans at Emmaus, who were carrying corn and weapons to their legion;\r\nhis men therefore shot their arrows and darts, and thereby slew their\r\ncenturion Arius, and forty of the stoutest of his men, while the rest\r\nof them, who were in danger of the same fate, upon the coming of Gratus,\r\nwith those of Sebaste, to their assistance, escaped. And when these\r\nmen had thus served both their own countrymen and foreigners, and that\r\nthrough this whole war, three of them were, after some time, subdued;\r\nthe eldest by Archelaus, the two next by falling into the hands of\r\nGratus and Ptolemeus; but the fourth delivered himself up to Archelaus,\r\nupon his giving him his right hand for his security. However, this their\r\nend was not till afterward, while at present they filled all Judea with\r\na piratic war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Varus Composes The Tumults In Judea And Crucifies About Two\r\n     Thousand Of The Seditious.\r\n\r\n1. Upon Varus's reception of the letters that were written by Sabinus\r\nand the captains, he could not avoid being afraid for the whole legion\r\n[he had left there]. So he made haste to their relief, and took with\r\nhim the other two legions, with the four troops of horsemen to them\r\nbelonging, and marched to Ptolenlais; having given orders for the\r\nauxiliaries that were sent by the kings and governors of cities to\r\nmeet him there. Moreover, he received from the people of Berytus, as he\r\npassed through their city, fifteen hundred armed men. Now as soon as the\r\nother body of auxiliaries were come to Ptolemais, as well as Aretas the\r\nArabian, [who, out of the hatred he bore to Herod, brought a great army\r\nof horse and foot,] Varus sent a part of his army presently to Galilee,\r\nwhich lay near to Ptolemais, and Caius, one of his friends, for their\r\ncaptain. This Caius put those that met him to flight, and took the city\r\nSepphoris, and burnt it, and made slaves of its inhabitants; but as for\r\nVarus himself, he marched to Samaria with his whole army, where he did\r\nnot meddle with the city itself, because he found that it had made no\r\ncommotion during these troubles, but pitched his camp about a certain\r\nvillage which was called Aras. It belonged to Ptolemy, and on that\r\naccount was plundered by the Arabians, who were very angry even at\r\nHerod's friends also. He thence marched on to the village Sampho,\r\nanother fortified place, which they plundered, as they had done the\r\nother. As they carried off all the money they lighted upon belonging\r\nto the public revenues, all was now full of fire and blood-shed, and\r\nnothing could resist the plunders of the Arabians. Emnaus was also\r\nburnt, upon the flight of its inhabitants, and this at the command of\r\nVarus, out of his rage at the slaughter of those that were about Arias.\r\n\r\n2. Thence he marched on to Jerusalem, and as soon as he was but seen by\r\nthe Jews, he made their camps disperse themselves; they also went away,\r\nand fled up and down the country. But the citizens received him, and\r\ncleared themselves of having any hand in this revolt, and said that\r\nthey had raised no commotions, but had only been forced to admit the\r\nmultitude, because of the festival, and that they were rather besieged\r\ntogether with the Romans, than assisted those that had revolted. There\r\nhad before this met him Joseph, the first cousin of Archelaus, and\r\nGratus, together with Rufus, who led those of Sebaste, as well as the\r\nking's army: there also met him those of the Roman legion, armed after\r\ntheir accustomed manner; for as to Sabinus, he durst not come into\r\nVarus's sight, but was gone out of the city before this, to the\r\nsea-side. But Varus sent a part of his army into the country, against\r\nthose that had been the authors of this commotion, and as they caught\r\ngreat numbers of them, those that appeared to have been the least\r\nconcerned in these tumults he put into custody, but such as were the\r\nmost guilty he crucified; these were in number about two thousand.\r\n\r\n3. He was also informed that there continued in Idumea ten thousand\r\nmen still in arms; but when he found that the Arabians did not act like\r\nauxiliaries, but managed the war according to their own passions, and\r\ndid mischief to the country otherwise than he intended, and this out of\r\ntheir hatred to Herod, he sent them away, but made haste, with his own\r\nlegions, to march against those that had revolted; but these, by the\r\nadvice of Achiabus, delivered themselves up to him before it came to a\r\nbattle. Then did Varus forgive the multitude their offenses, but sent\r\ntheir captains to Caesar to be examined by him. Now Caesar forgave the\r\nrest, but gave orders that certain of the king's relations [for some of\r\nthose that were among them were Herod's kinsmen] should be put to death,\r\nbecause they had engaged in a war against a king of their own family.\r\nWhen therefore Varus had settled matters at Jerusalem after this manner,\r\nand had left the former legion there as a garrison, he returned to\r\nAntioch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Jews Greatly Complain Of Archelaus And Desire That They\r\n     May Be Made Subject To Roman Governors. But When Caesar Had\r\n     Heard What They Had To Say, He Distributed Herod's Dominions\r\n     Among His Sons According To His Own Pleasure.\r\n\r\n1. But now came another accusation from the Jews against Archelaus at\r\nRome, which he was to answer to. It was made by those ambassadors who,\r\nbefore the revolt, had come, by Varus's permission, to plead for the\r\nliberty of their country; those that came were fifty in number, but\r\nthere were more than eight thousand of the Jews at Rome who supported\r\nthem. And when Caesar had assembled a council of the principal Romans in\r\nApollo's 2 temple, that was in the palace, [this was what he had himself\r\nbuilt and adorned, at a vast expense,] the multitude of the Jews stood\r\nwith the ambassadors, and on the other side stood Archelaus, with his\r\nfriends; but as for the kindred of Archelaus, they stood on neither\r\nside; for to stand on Archelaus's side, their hatred to him, and envy at\r\nhim, would not give them leave, while yet they were afraid to be seen by\r\nCaesar with his accusers. Besides these, there were present Archelaus's\r\nbrother Philip, being sent thither beforehand, out of kindness by\r\nVarus, for two reasons: the one was this, that he might be assisting\r\nto Archelaus; and the other was this, that in case Caesar should make\r\na distribution of what Herod possessed among his posterity, he might\r\nobtain some share of it.\r\n\r\n2. And now, upon the permission that was given the accusers to speak,\r\nthey, in the first place, went over Herod's breaches of their law, and\r\nsaid that he was not a king, but the most barbarous of all tyrants, and\r\nthat they had found him to be such by the sufferings they underwent from\r\nhim; that when a very great number had been slain by him, those that\r\nwere left had endured such miseries, that they called those that\r\nwere dead happy men; that he had not only tortured the bodies of his\r\nsubjects, but entire cities, and had done much harm to the cities of his\r\nown country, while he adorned those that belonged to foreigners; and he\r\nshed the blood of Jews, in order to do kindnesses to those people that\r\nwere out of their bounds; that he had filled the nation full of poverty,\r\nand of the greatest iniquity, instead of that happiness and those laws\r\nwhich they had anciently enjoyed; that, in short, the Jews had borne\r\nmore calamities from Herod, in a few years, than had their forefathers\r\nduring all that interval of time that had passed since they had come out\r\nof Babylon, and returned home, in the reign of Xerxes 3 that, however,\r\nthe nation was come to so low a condition, by being inured to hardships,\r\nthat they submitted to his successor of their own accord, though he\r\nbrought them into bitter slavery; that accordingly they readily called\r\nArchelaus, though he was the son of so great a tyrant, king, after the\r\ndecease of his father, and joined with him in mourning for the death of\r\nHerod, and in wishing him good success in that his succession; while\r\nyet this Archelaus, lest he should be in danger of not being thought the\r\ngenuine son of Herod, began his reign with the murder of three thousand\r\ncitizens; as if he had a mind to offer so many bloody sacrifices to God\r\nfor his government, and to fill the temple with the like number of dead\r\nbodies at that festival: that, however, those that were left after so\r\nmany miseries, had just reason to consider now at last the calamities\r\nthey had undergone, and to oppose themselves, like soldiers in war, to\r\nreceive those stripes upon their faces [but not upon their backs, as\r\nhitherto]. Whereupon they prayed that the Romans would have compassion\r\nupon the [poor] remains of Judea, and not expose what was left of them\r\nto such as barbarously tore them to pieces, and that they would join\r\ntheir country to Syria, and administer the government by their own\r\ncommanders, whereby it would [soon] be demonstrated that those who are\r\nnow under the calumny of seditious persons, and lovers of war, know how\r\nto bear governors that are set over them, if they be but tolerable ones.\r\nSo the Jews concluded their accusation with this request. Then rose up\r\nNicolaus, and confuted the accusations which were brought against the\r\nkings, and himself accused the Jewish nation, as hard to be ruled, and\r\nas naturally disobedient to kings. He also reproached all those kinsmen\r\nof Archelaus who had left him, and were gone over to his accusers.\r\n\r\n3. So Caesar, after he had heard both sides, dissolved the assembly for\r\nthat time; but a few days afterward, he gave the one half of Herod's\r\nkingdom to Archelaus, by the name of Ethnarch, and promised to make him\r\nking also afterward, if he rendered himself worthy of that dignity. But\r\nas to the other half, he divided it into two tetrarchies, and gave them\r\nto two other sons of Herod, the one of them to Philip, and the other to\r\nthat Antipas who contested the kingdom with Archelaus. Under this\r\nlast was Perea and Galilee, with a revenue of two hundred talents; but\r\nBatanea, and Trachonitis, and Auranitis, and certain parts of Zeno's\r\nhouse about Jamnia, with a revenue of a hundred talents, were made\r\nsubject to Philip; while Idumea, and all Judea, and Samaria were parts\r\nof the ethnarchy of Archelaus, although Samaria was eased of one quarter\r\nof its taxes, out of regard to their not having revolted with the rest\r\nof the nation. He also made subject to him the following cities, viz.\r\nStrato's Tower, and Sebaste, and Joppa, and Jerusalem; but as to the\r\nGrecian cities, Gaza, and Gadara, and Hippos, he cut them off from the\r\nkingdom, and added them to Syria. Now the revenue of the country that\r\nwas given to Archelaus was four hundred talents. Salome also, besides\r\nwhat the king had left her in his testaments, was now made mistress of\r\nJamnia, and Ashdod, and Phasaelis. Caesar did moreover bestow upon her\r\nthe royal palace of Ascalon; by all which she got together a revenue of\r\nsixty talents; but he put her house under the ethnarchy of Archelaus.\r\nAnd for the rest of Herod's offspring, they received what was bequeathed\r\nto them in his testaments; but, besides that, Caesar granted to Herod's\r\ntwo virgin daughters five hundred thousand [drachmae] of silver, and\r\ngave them in marriage to the sons of Pheroras: but after this family\r\ndistribution, he gave between them what had been bequeathed to him by\r\nHerod, which was a thousand talents, reserving to himself only some\r\ninconsiderable presents, in honor of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The History Of The Spurious Alexander. Archelaus Is Banished\r\n     And Glaphyra Dies, After What Was To Happen To Both Of Them\r\n     Had Been Showed Them In Dreams.\r\n\r\n1. In the meantime, there was a man, who was by birth a Jew, but brought\r\nup at Sidon with one of the Roman freed-men, who falsely pretended,\r\non account of the resemblance of their countenances, that he was that\r\nAlexander who was slain by Herod. This man came to Rome, in hopes of not\r\nbeing detected. He had one who was his assistant, of his own nation, and\r\nwho knew all the affairs of the kingdom, and instructed him to say how\r\nthose that were sent to kill him and Aristobulus had pity upon them,\r\nand stole them away, by putting bodies that were like theirs in their\r\nplaces. This man deceived the Jews that were at Crete, and got a great\r\ndeal of money of them for traveling in splendor; and thence sailed to\r\nMelos, where he was thought so certainly genuine, that he got a great\r\ndeal more money, and prevailed with those that had treated him to sail\r\nalong with him to Rome. So he landed at Dicearchia, [Puteoli,] and got\r\nvery large presents from the Jews who dwelt there, and was conducted by\r\nhis father's friends as if he were a king; nay, the resemblance in\r\nhis countenance procured him so much credit, that those who had seen\r\nAlexander, and had known him very well, would take their oaths that he\r\nwas the very same person. Accordingly, the whole body of the Jews that\r\nwere at Rome ran out in crowds to see him, and an innumerable multitude\r\nthere was which stood in the narrow places through which he was carried;\r\nfor those of Melos were so far distracted, that they carried him in a\r\nsedan, and maintained a royal attendance for him at their own proper\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n2. But Caesar, who knew perfectly well the lineaments of Alexander's\r\nface, because he had been accused by Herod before him, discerned the\r\nfallacy in his countenance, even before he saw the man. However, he\r\nsuffered the agreeable fame that went of him to have some weight with\r\nhim, and sent Celadus, one who well knew Alexander, and ordered him\r\nto bring the young man to him. But when Caesar saw him, he immediately\r\ndiscerned a difference in his countenance; and when he had discovered\r\nthat his whole body was of a more robust texture, and like that of a\r\nslave, he understood the whole was a contrivance. But the impudence of\r\nwhat he said greatly provoked him to be angry at him; for when he was\r\nasked about Aristobulus, he said that he was also preserved alive, and\r\nwas left on purpose in Cyprus, for fear of treachery, because it would\r\nbe harder for plotters to get them both into their power while they were\r\nseparate. Then did Caesar take him by himself privately, and said to\r\nhim, \"I will give thee thy life, if thou wilt discover who it was that\r\npersuaded thee to forge such stories.\" So he said that he would discover\r\nhim, and followed Caesar, and pointed to that Jew who abused the\r\nresemblance of his face to get money; for that he had received more\r\npresents in every city than ever Alexander did when he was alive. Caesar\r\nlaughed at the contrivance, and put this spurious Alexander among his\r\nrowers, on account of the strength of his body, but ordered him that\r\npersuaded him to be put to death. But for the people of Melos, they had\r\nbeen sufficiently punished for their folly, by the expenses they had\r\nbeen at on his account.\r\n\r\n3. And now Archelaus took possession of his ethnarchy, and used not the\r\nJews only, but the Samaritans also, barbarously; and this out of his\r\nresentment of their old quarrels with him. Whereupon they both of them\r\nsent ambassadors against him to Caesar; and in the ninth year of his\r\ngovernment he was banished to Vienna, a city of Gaul, and his effects\r\nwere put into Caesar's treasury. But the report goes, that before he was\r\nsent for by Caesar, he seemed to see nine ears of corn, full and large,\r\nbut devoured by oxen. When, therefore, he had sent for the diviners,\r\nand some of the Chaldeans, and inquired of them what they thought it\r\nportended; and when one of them had one interpretation, and another had\r\nanother, Simon, one of the sect of Essens, said that he thought the\r\nears of corn denoted years, and the oxen denoted a mutation of things,\r\nbecause by their ploughing they made an alteration of the country. That\r\ntherefore he should reign as many years as there were ears of corn; and\r\nafter he had passed through various alterations of fortune, should\r\ndie. Now five days after Archelaus had heard this interpretation he was\r\ncalled to his trial.\r\n\r\n4. I cannot also but think it worthy to be recorded what dream Glaphyra,\r\nthe daughter of Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, had, who had at first\r\nbeen wife to Alexander, who was the brother of Archelaus, concerning\r\nwhom we have been discoursing. This Alexander was the son of Herod the\r\nking, by whom he was put to death, as we have already related. This\r\nGlaphyra was married, after his death, to Juba, king of Libya; and,\r\nafter his death, was returned home, and lived a widow with her father.\r\nThen it was that Archelaus, the ethnarch, saw her, and fell so deeply\r\nin love with her, that he divorced Mariamne, who was then his wife,\r\nand married her. When, therefore, she was come into Judea, and had been\r\nthere for a little while, she thought she saw Alexander stand by her,\r\nand that he said to her; \"Thy marriage with the king of Libya might have\r\nbeen sufficient for thee; but thou wast not contented with him, but art\r\nreturned again to my family, to a third husband; and him, thou impudent\r\nwoman, hast thou chosen for thine husband, who is my brother. However, I\r\nshall not overlook the injury thou hast offered me; I shall [soon] have\r\nthee again, whether thou wilt or no.\" Now Glaphyra hardly survived the\r\nnarration of this dream of hers two days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Archelaus's Ethnarchy Is Reduced Into A [Roman] Province.\r\n     The Sedition Of Judas Of Galilee. The Three Sects.\r\n\r\n1. And now Archelaus's part of Judea was reduced into a province, and\r\nCoponius, one of the equestrian order among the Romans, was sent as a\r\nprocurator, having the power of [life and] death put into his hands by\r\nCaesar. Under his administration it was that a certain Galilean, whose\r\nname was Judas, prevailed with his countrymen to revolt, and said they\r\nwere cowards if they would endure to pay a tax to the Romans and would\r\nafter God submit to mortal men as their lords. This man was a teacher\r\nof a peculiar sect of his own, and was not at all like the rest of those\r\ntheir leaders.\r\n\r\n2. For there are three philosophical sects among the Jews. The followers\r\nof the first of which are the Pharisees; of the second, the Sadducees;\r\nand the third sect, which pretends to a severer discipline, are called\r\nEssens. These last are Jews by birth, and seem to have a greater\r\naffection for one another than the other sects have. These Essens reject\r\npleasures as an evil, but esteem continence, and the conquest over\r\nour passions, to be virtue. They neglect wedlock, but choose out other\r\npersons children, while they are pliable, and fit for learning, and\r\nesteem them to be of their kindred, and form them according to their own\r\nmanners. They do not absolutely deny the fitness of marriage, and the\r\nsuccession of mankind thereby continued; but they guard against the\r\nlascivious behavior of women, and are persuaded that none of them\r\npreserve their fidelity to one man.\r\n\r\n3. These men are despisers of riches, and so very communicative as\r\nraises our admiration. Nor is there any one to be found among them who\r\nhath more than another; for it is a law among them, that those who come\r\nto them must let what they have be common to the whole order,--insomuch\r\nthat among them all there is no appearance of poverty, or excess of\r\nriches, but every one's possessions are intermingled with every other's\r\npossessions; and so there is, as it were, one patrimony among all the\r\nbrethren. They think that oil is a defilement; and if any one of them be\r\nanointed without his own approbation, it is wiped off his body; for they\r\nthink to be sweaty is a good thing, as they do also to be clothed in\r\nwhite garments. They also have stewards appointed to take care of their\r\ncommon affairs, who every one of them have no separate business for any,\r\nbut what is for the uses of them all.\r\n\r\n4. They have no one certain city, but many of them dwell in every city;\r\nand if any of their sect come from other places, what they have lies\r\nopen for them, just as if it were their own; and they go in to such as\r\nthey never knew before, as if they had been ever so long acquainted with\r\nthem. For which reason they carry nothing at all with them when they\r\ntravel into remote parts, though still they take their weapons with\r\nthem, for fear of thieves. Accordingly, there is, in every city where\r\nthey live, one appointed particularly to take care of strangers, and\r\nto provide garments and other necessaries for them. But the habit and\r\nmanagement of their bodies is such as children use who are in fear of\r\ntheir masters. Nor do they allow of the change of garments or of shoes\r\ntill be first torn to pieces, or worn out by time. Nor do they either\r\nbuy or sell any thing to one another; but every one of them gives what\r\nhe hath to him that wanteth it, and receives from him again in lieu of\r\nit what may be convenient for himself; and although there be no requital\r\nmade, they are fully allowed to take what they want of whomsoever they\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n5. And as for their piety towards God, it is very extraordinary; for\r\nbefore sun-rising they speak not a word about profane matters, but put\r\nup certain prayers which they have received from their forefathers, as\r\nif they made a supplication for its rising. After this every one of them\r\nare sent away by their curators, to exercise some of those arts wherein\r\nthey are skilled, in which they labor with great diligence till the\r\nfifth hour. After which they assemble themselves together again into one\r\nplace; and when they have clothed themselves in white veils, they then\r\nbathe their bodies in cold water. And after this purification is over,\r\nthey every one meet together in an apartment of their own, into which it\r\nis not permitted to any of another sect to enter; while they go, after\r\na pure manner, into the dining-room, as into a certain holy temple, and\r\nquietly set themselves down; upon which the baker lays them loaves in\r\norder; the cook also brings a single plate of one sort of food, and sets\r\nit before every one of them; but a priest says grace before meat; and it\r\nis unlawful for any one to taste of the food before grace be said. The\r\nsame priest, when he hath dined, says grace again after meat; and when\r\nthey begin, and when they end, they praise God, as he that bestows their\r\nfood upon them; after which they lay aside their [white] garments, and\r\nbetake themselves to their labors again till the evening; then they\r\nreturn home to supper, after the same manner; and if there be any\r\nstrangers there, they sit down with them. Nor is there ever any clamor\r\nor disturbance to pollute their house, but they give every one leave to\r\nspeak in their turn; which silence thus kept in their house appears\r\nto foreigners like some tremendous mystery; the cause of which is that\r\nperpetual sobriety they exercise, and the same settled measure of\r\nmeat and drink that is allotted them, and that such as is abundantly\r\nsufficient for them.\r\n\r\n6. And truly, as for other things, they do nothing but according to the\r\ninjunctions of their curators; only these two things are done among them\r\nat everyone's own free-will, which are to assist those that want it,\r\nand to show mercy; for they are permitted of their own accord to afford\r\nsuccor to such as deserve it, when they stand in need of it, and to\r\nbestow food on those that are in distress; but they cannot give any\r\nthing to their kindred without the curators. They dispense their anger\r\nafter a just manner, and restrain their passion. They are eminent for\r\nfidelity, and are the ministers of peace; whatsoever they say also is\r\nfirmer than an oath; but swearing is avoided by them, and they esteem it\r\nworse than perjury 4 for they say that he who cannot be believed without\r\n[swearing by] God is already condemned. They also take great pains in\r\nstudying the writings of the ancients, and choose out of them what is\r\nmost for the advantage of their soul and body; and they inquire after\r\nsuch roots and medicinal stones as may cure their distempers.\r\n\r\n7. But now if any one hath a mind to come over to their sect, he is not\r\nimmediately admitted, but he is prescribed the same method of living\r\nwhich they use for a year, while he continues excluded'; and they give\r\nhim also a small hatchet, and the fore-mentioned girdle, and the white\r\ngarment. And when he hath given evidence, during that time, that he can\r\nobserve their continence, he approaches nearer to their way of living,\r\nand is made a partaker of the waters of purification; yet is he not\r\neven now admitted to live with them; for after this demonstration of his\r\nfortitude, his temper is tried two more years; and if he appear to be\r\nworthy, they then admit him into their society. And before he is allowed\r\nto touch their common food, he is obliged to take tremendous oaths,\r\nthat, in the first place, he will exercise piety towards God, and then\r\nthat he will observe justice towards men, and that he will do no harm to\r\nany one, either of his own accord, or by the command of others; that he\r\nwill always hate the wicked, and be assistant to the righteous; that\r\nhe will ever show fidelity to all men, and especially to those\r\nin authority, because no one obtains the government without God's\r\nassistance; and that if he be in authority, he will at no time whatever\r\nabuse his authority, nor endeavor to outshine his subjects either in his\r\ngarments, or any other finery; that he will be perpetually a lover of\r\ntruth, and propose to himself to reprove those that tell lies; that he\r\nwill keep his hands clear from theft, and his soul from unlawful gains;\r\nand that he will neither conceal any thing from those of his own sect,\r\nnor discover any of their doctrines to others, no, not though anyone\r\nshould compel him so to do at the hazard of his life. Moreover, he\r\nswears to communicate their doctrines to no one any otherwise than as\r\nhe received them himself; that he will abstain from robbery, and will\r\nequally preserve the books belonging to their sect, and the names of the\r\nangels 5 [or messengers]. These are the oaths by which they secure their\r\nproselytes to themselves.\r\n\r\n8. But for those that are caught in any heinous sins, they cast them out\r\nof their society; and he who is thus separated from them does often die\r\nafter a miserable manner; for as he is bound by the oath he hath taken,\r\nand by the customs he hath been engaged in, he is not at liberty to\r\npartake of that food that he meets with elsewhere, but is forced to eat\r\ngrass, and to famish his body with hunger, till he perish; for which\r\nreason they receive many of them again when they are at their last gasp,\r\nout of compassion to them, as thinking the miseries they have endured\r\ntill they came to the very brink of death to be a sufficient punishment\r\nfor the sins they had been guilty of.\r\n\r\n9. But in the judgments they exercise they are most accurate and just,\r\nnor do they pass sentence by the votes of a court that is fewer than\r\na hundred. And as to what is once determined by that number, it is\r\nunalterable. What they most of all honor, after God himself, is the name\r\nof their legislator [Moses], whom if any one blaspheme he is punished\r\ncapitally. They also think it a good thing to obey their elders, and the\r\nmajor part. Accordingly, if ten of them be sitting together, no one of\r\nthem will speak while the other nine are against it. They also avoid\r\nspitting in the midst of them, or on the right side. Moreover, they are\r\nstricter than any other of the Jews in resting from their labors on the\r\nseventh day; for they not only get their food ready the day before, that\r\nthey may not be obliged to kindle a fire on that day, but they will not\r\nremove any vessel out of its place, nor go to stool thereon. Nay, on\r\nother days they dig a small pit, a foot deep, with a paddle [which kind\r\nof hatchet is given them when they are first admitted among them]; and\r\ncovering themselves round with their garment, that they may not affront\r\nthe Divine rays of light, they ease themselves into that pit, after\r\nwhich they put the earth that was dug out again into the pit; and even\r\nthis they do only in the more lonely places, which they choose out for\r\nthis purpose; and although this easement of the body be natural, yet\r\nit is a rule with them to wash themselves after it, as if it were a\r\ndefilement to them.\r\n\r\n10. Now after the time of their preparatory trial is over, they are\r\nparted into four classes; and so far are the juniors inferior to the\r\nseniors, that if the seniors should be touched by the juniors, they must\r\nwash themselves, as if they had intermixed themselves with the company\r\nof a foreigner. They are long-lived also, insomuch that many of them\r\nlive above a hundred years, by means of the simplicity of their diet;\r\nnay, as I think, by means of the regular course of life they observe\r\nalso. They contemn the miseries of life, and are above pain, by the\r\ngenerosity of their mind. And as for death, if it will be for their\r\nglory, they esteem it better than living always; and indeed our war with\r\nthe Romans gave abundant evidence what great souls they had in their\r\ntrials, wherein, although they were tortured and distorted, burnt and\r\ntorn to pieces, and went through all kinds of instruments of torment,\r\nthat they might be forced either to blaspheme their legislator, or to\r\neat what was forbidden them, yet could they not be made to do either of\r\nthem, no, nor once to flatter their tormentors, or to shed a tear;\r\nbut they smiled in their very pains, and laughed those to scorn who\r\ninflicted the torments upon them, and resigned up their souls with great\r\nalacrity, as expecting to receive them again.\r\n\r\n11. For their doctrine is this: That bodies are corruptible, and that\r\nthe matter they are made of is not permanent; but that the souls are\r\nimmortal, and continue for ever; and that they come out of the most\r\nsubtile air, and are united to their bodies as to prisons, into which\r\nthey are drawn by a certain natural enticement; but that when they are\r\nset free from the bonds of the flesh, they then, as released from a long\r\nbondage, rejoice and mount upward. And this is like the opinions of the\r\nGreeks, that good souls have their habitations beyond the ocean, in a\r\nregion that is neither oppressed with storms of rain or snow, or with\r\nintense heat, but that this place is such as is refreshed by the gentle\r\nbreathing of a west wind, that is perpetually blowing from the ocean;\r\nwhile they allot to bad souls a dark and tempestuous den, full of\r\nnever-ceasing punishments. And indeed the Greeks seem to me to have\r\nfollowed the same notion, when they allot the islands of the blessed to\r\ntheir brave men, whom they call heroes and demi-gods; and to the souls\r\nof the wicked, the region of the ungodly, in Hades, where their fables\r\nrelate that certain persons, such as Sisyphus, and Tantalus, and Ixion,\r\nand Tityus, are punished; which is built on this first supposition,\r\nthat souls are immortal; and thence are those exhortations to virtue and\r\ndehortations from wickedness collected; whereby good men are bettered\r\nin the conduct of their life by the hope they have of reward after their\r\ndeath; and whereby the vehement inclinations of bad men to vice are\r\nrestrained, by the fear and expectation they are in, that although\r\nthey should lie concealed in this life, they should suffer immortal\r\npunishment after their death. These are the Divine doctrines of the\r\nEssens 6 about the soul, which lay an unavoidable bait for such as have\r\nonce had a taste of their philosophy.\r\n\r\n12. There are also those among them who undertake to foretell things\r\nto come, 7 by reading the holy books, and using several sorts of\r\npurifications, and being perpetually conversant in the discourses of the\r\nprophets; and it is but seldom that they miss in their predictions.\r\n\r\n13. Moreover, there is another order of Essens, 8 who agree with the\r\nrest as to their way of living, and customs, and laws, but differ from\r\nthem in the point of marriage, as thinking that by not marrying they\r\ncut off the principal part of human life, which is the prospect of\r\nsuccession; nay, rather, that if all men should be of the same opinion,\r\nthe whole race of mankind would fail. However, they try their spouses\r\nfor three years; and if they find that they have their natural\r\npurgations thrice, as trials that they are likely to be fruitful, they\r\nthen actually marry them. But they do not use to accompany with their\r\nwives when they are with child, as a demonstration that they do not many\r\nout of regard to pleasure, but for the sake of posterity. Now the women\r\ngo into the baths with some of their garments on, as the men do with\r\nsomewhat girded about them. And these are the customs of this order of\r\nEssens.\r\n\r\n14. But then as to the two other orders at first mentioned, the\r\nPharisees are those who are esteemed most skillful in the exact\r\nexplication of their laws, and introduce the first sect. These ascribe\r\nall to fate [or providence], and to God, and yet allow, that to act what\r\nis right, or the contrary, is principally in the power of men, although\r\nfate does co-operate in every action. They say that all souls are\r\nincorruptible, but that the souls of good men only are removed into\r\nother bodies,--but that the souls of bad men are subject to eternal\r\npunishment. But the Sadducees are those that compose the second order,\r\nand take away fate entirely, and suppose that God is not concerned in\r\nour doing or not doing what is evil; and they say, that to act what is\r\ngood, or what is evil, is at men's own choice, and that the one or the\r\nother belongs so to every one, that they may act as they please. They\r\nalso take away the belief of the immortal duration of the soul, and the\r\npunishments and rewards in Hades. Moreover, the Pharisees are friendly\r\nto one another, and are for the exercise of concord, and regard for the\r\npublic; but the behavior of the Sadducees one towards another is in some\r\ndegree wild, and their conversation with those that are of their own\r\nparty is as barbarous as if they were strangers to them. And this is\r\nwhat I had to say concerning the philosophic sects among the Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Death Of Salome. The Cities Which Herod And Philip\r\n     Built. Pilate Occasions Disturbances. Tiberius Puts Agrippa\r\n     Into Bonds But Caius Frees Him From Them, And Makes Him\r\n     King. Herod Antipas Is Banished.\r\n\r\n1. And now as the ethnarchy of Archelaus was fallen into a Roman\r\nprovince, the other sons of Herod, Philip, and that Herod who was called\r\nAntipas, each of them took upon them the administration of their own\r\ntetrarchies; for when Salome died, she bequeathed to Julia, the wife of\r\nAugustus, both her toparchy, and Jamriga, as also her plantation of palm\r\ntrees that were in Phasaelis. But when the Roman empire was translated\r\nto Tiberius, the son of Julia, upon the death of Augustus, who had\r\nreigned fifty-seven years, six months, and two days, both Herod and\r\nPhilip continued in their tetrarchies; and the latter of them built the\r\ncity Cesarea, at the fountains of Jordan, and in the region of Paneas;\r\nas also the city Julias, in the lower Gaulonitis. Herod also built the\r\ncity Tiberius in Galilee, and in Perea [beyond Jordan] another that was\r\nalso called Julias.\r\n\r\n2. Now Pilate, who was sent as procurator into Judea by Tiberius, sent\r\nby night those images of Caesar that are called ensigns into Jerusalem.\r\nThis excited a very great tumult among the Jews when it was day;\r\nfor those that were near them were astonished at the sight of them, as\r\nindications that their laws were trodden under foot; for those laws do\r\nnot permit any sort of image to be brought into the city. Nay, besides\r\nthe indignation which the citizens had themselves at this procedure,\r\na vast number of people came running out of the country. These came\r\nzealously to Pilate to Cesarea, and besought him to carry those ensigns\r\nout of Jerusalem, and to preserve them their ancient laws inviolable;\r\nbut upon Pilate's denial of their request, they fell 9 down prostrate\r\nupon the ground, and continued immovable in that posture for five days\r\nand as many nights.\r\n\r\n3. On the next day Pilate sat upon his tribunal, in the open\r\nmarket-place, and called to him the multitude, as desirous to give them\r\nan answer; and then gave a signal to the soldiers, that they should all\r\nby agreement at once encompass the Jews with their weapons; so the band\r\nof soldiers stood round about the Jews in three ranks. The Jews were\r\nunder the utmost consternation at that unexpected sight. Pilate also\r\nsaid to them that they should be cut in pieces, unless they would admit\r\nof Caesar's images, and gave intimation to the soldiers to draw their\r\nnaked swords. Hereupon the Jews, as it were at one signal, fell down in\r\nvast numbers together, and exposed their necks bare, and cried out\r\nthat they were sooner ready to be slain, than that their law should be\r\ntransgressed. Hereupon Pilate was greatly surprised at their prodigious\r\nsuperstition, and gave order that the ensigns should be presently\r\ncarried out of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n4. After this he raised another disturbance, by expending that sacred\r\ntreasure which is called Corban 10 upon aqueducts, whereby he brought\r\nwater from the distance of four hundred furlongs. At this the multitude\r\nhad indignation; and when Pilate was come to Jerusalem, they came\r\nabout his tribunal, and made a clamor at it. Now when he was apprized\r\naforehand of this disturbance, he mixed his own soldiers in their armor\r\nwith the multitude, and ordered them to conceal themselves under the\r\nhabits of private men, and not indeed to use their swords, but with\r\ntheir staves to beat those that made the clamor. He then gave the signal\r\nfrom his tribunal [to do as he had bidden them]. Now the Jews were so\r\nsadly beaten, that many of them perished by the stripes they received,\r\nand many of them perished as trodden to death by themselves; by which\r\nmeans the multitude was astonished at the calamity of those that were\r\nslain, and held their peace.\r\n\r\n5. In the mean time Agrippa, the son of that Aristobulus who had\r\nbeen slain by his father Herod, came to Tiberius, to accuse Herod the\r\ntetrarch; who not admitting of his accusation, he staid at Rome, and\r\ncultivated a friendship with others of the men of note, but principally\r\nwith Caius the son of Germanicus, who was then but a private person.\r\nNow this Agrippa, at a certain time, feasted Caius; and as he was very\r\ncomplaisant to him on several other accounts, he at length stretched out\r\nhis hands, and openly wished that Tiberius might die, and that he might\r\nquickly see him emperor of the world. This was told to Tiberius by\r\none of Agrippa's domestics, who thereupon was very angry, and ordered\r\nAgrippa to be bound, and had him very ill-treated in the prison for six\r\nmonths, until Tiberius died, after he had reigned twenty-two years, six\r\nmonths, and three days.\r\n\r\n6. But when Caius was made Caesar, he released Agrippa from his bonds,\r\nand made him king of Philip's tetrarchy, who was now dead; but when\r\nAgrippa had arrived at that degree of dignity, he inflamed the ambitious\r\ndesires of Herod the tetrarch, who was chiefly induced to hope for the\r\nroyal authority by his wife Herodias, who reproached him for his sloth,\r\nand told him that it was only because he would not sail to Caesar\r\nthat he was destitute of that great dignity; for since Caesar had made\r\nAgrippa a king, from a private person, much mole would he advance him\r\nfrom a tetrarch to that dignity. These arguments prevailed with Herod,\r\nso that he came to Caius, by whom he was punished for his ambition, by\r\nbeing banished into Spain; for Agrippa followed him, in order to accuse\r\nhim; to whom also Caius gave his tetrarchy, by way of addition. So Herod\r\ndied in Spain, whither his wife had followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Caius Commands That His Statue Should Be Set Up In The\r\n     Temple Itself; And What Petronius Did Thereupon.\r\n\r\n1. Now Caius Caesar did so grossly abuse the fortune he had arrived at,\r\nas to take himself to be a god, and to desire to be so called also, and\r\nto cut off those of the greatest nobility out of his country. He also\r\nextended his impiety as far as the Jews. Accordingly, he sent Petronius\r\nwith an army to Jerusalem, to place his statues in the temple, 11 and\r\ncommanded him that, in case the Jews would not admit of them, he should\r\nslay those that opposed it, and carry all the rest of the nation into\r\ncaptivity: but God concerned himself with these his commands. However,\r\nPetronius marched out of Antioch into Judea, with three legions, and\r\nmany Syrian auxiliaries. Now as to the Jews, some of them could not\r\nbelieve the stories that spake of a war; but those that did believe them\r\nwere in the utmost distress how to defend themselves, and the terror\r\ndiffused itself presently through them all; for the army was already\r\ncome to Ptolemais.\r\n\r\n2. This Ptolemais is a maritime city of Galilee, built in the great\r\nplain. It is encompassed with mountains: that on the east side, sixty\r\nfurlongs off, belongs to Galilee; but that on the south belongs to\r\nCarmel, which is distant from it a hundred and twenty furlongs; and that\r\non the north is the highest of them all, and is called by the people of\r\nthe country, The Ladder of the Tyrians, which is at the distance of\r\na hundred furlongs. The very small river Belus 12 runs by it, at the\r\ndistance of two furlongs; near which there is Menmon's monument, 13 and\r\nhath near it a place no larger than a hundred cubits, which deserves\r\nadmiration; for the place is round and hollow, and affords such sand\r\nas glass is made of; which place, when it hath been emptied by the many\r\nships there loaded, it is filled again by the winds, which bring into\r\nit, as it were on purpose, that sand which lay remote, and was no more\r\nthan bare common sand, while this mine presently turns it into glassy\r\nsand. And what is to me still more wonderful, that glassy sand which is\r\nsuperfluous, and is once removed out of the place, becomes bare common\r\nsand again. And this is the nature of the place we are speaking of.\r\n\r\n3. But now the Jews got together in great numbers with their wives and\r\nchildren into that plain that was by Ptolemais, and made supplication to\r\nPetronius, first for their laws, and, in the next place, for themselves.\r\nSo he was prevailed upon by the multitude of the supplicants, and by\r\ntheir supplications, and left his army and the statues at Ptolemais, and\r\nthen went forward into Galilee, and called together the multitude\r\nand all the men of note to Tiberias, and showed them the power of the\r\nRomans, and the threatenings of Caesar; and, besides this, proved\r\nthat their petition was unreasonable, because while all the nations\r\nin subjection to them had placed the images of Caesar in their several\r\ncities, among the rest of their gods, for them alone to oppose it, was\r\nalmost like the behavior of revolters, and was injurious to Caesar.\r\n\r\n4. And when they insisted on their law, and the custom of their country,\r\nand how it was not only not permitted them to make either an image of\r\nGod, or indeed of a man, and to put it in any despicable part of their\r\ncountry, much less in the temple itself, Petronius replied, \"And am\r\nnot I also,\" said he, \"bound to keep the law of my own lord? For if I\r\ntransgress it, and spare you, it is but just that I perish; while he\r\nthat sent me, and not I, will commence a war against you; for I am under\r\ncommand as well as you.\" Hereupon the whole multitude cried out that\r\nthey were ready to suffer for their law. Petronius then quieted them,\r\nand said to them, \"Will you then make war against Caesar?\" The Jews\r\nsaid, \"We offer sacrifices twice every day for Caesar, and for the Roman\r\npeople;\" but that if he would place the images among them, he must first\r\nsacrifice the whole Jewish nation; and that they were ready to expose\r\nthemselves, together with their children and wives, to be slain. At\r\nthis Petronius was astonished, and pitied them, on account of the\r\ninexpressible sense of religion the men were under, and that courage\r\nof theirs which made them ready to die for it; so they were dismissed\r\nwithout success.\r\n\r\n5. But on the following days he got together the men of power privately,\r\nand the multitude publicly, and sometimes he used persuasions to them,\r\nand sometimes he gave them his advice; but he chiefly made use of\r\nthreatenings to them, and insisted upon the power of the Romans, and the\r\nanger of Caius; and besides, upon the necessity he was himself under [to\r\ndo as he was enjoined]. But as they could be no way prevailed upon, and\r\nhe saw that the country was in danger of lying without tillage; [for it\r\nwas about seed time that the multitude continued for fifty days together\r\nidle;] so he at last got them together, and told them that it was\r\nbest for him to run some hazard himself; \"for either, by the Divine\r\nassistance, I shall prevail with Caesar, and shall myself escape the\r\ndanger as well as you, which will be matter of joy to us both; or, in\r\ncase Caesar continue in his rage, I will be ready to expose my own\r\nlife for such a great number as you are.\" Whereupon he dismissed the\r\nmultitude, who prayed greatly for his prosperity; and he took the army\r\nout of Ptolemais, and returned to Antioch; from whence he presently sent\r\nan epistle to Caesar, and informed him of the irruption he had made into\r\nJudea, and of the supplications of the nation; and that unless he had a\r\nmind to lose both the country and the men in it, he must permit them\r\nto keep their law, and must countermand his former injunction. Caius\r\nanswered that epistle in a violent-way, and threatened to have Petronius\r\nput to death for his being so tardy in the execution of what he had\r\ncommanded. But it happened that those who brought Caius's epistle were\r\ntossed by a storm, and were detained on the sea for three months,\r\nwhile others that brought the news of Caius's death had a good voyage.\r\nAccordingly, Petronins received the epistle concerning Caius seven and\r\ntwenty days before he received that which was against himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning The Government Of Claudius, And The Reign Of\r\n     Agrippa. Concerning The Deaths Of Agrippa And Of Herod And\r\n     What Children They Both Left Behind Them.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Caius had reigned three years and eight months, and had been\r\nslain by treachery, Claudius was hurried away by the armies that were at\r\nRome to take the government upon him; but the senate, upon the reference\r\nof the consuls, Sentis Saturninus, and Pomponius Secundus, gave orders\r\nto the three regiments of soldiers that staid with them to keep the city\r\nquiet, and went up into the capitol in great numbers, and resolved to\r\noppose Claudius by force, on account of the barbarous treatment they\r\nhad met with from Caius; and they determined either to settle the nation\r\nunder an aristocracy, as they had of old been governed, or at least to\r\nchoose by vote such a one for emperor as might be worthy of it.\r\n\r\n2. Now it happened that at this time Agrippa sojourned at Rome, and that\r\nboth the senate called him to consult with them, and at the same time\r\nClaudius sent for him out of the camp, that he might be serviceable to\r\nhim, as he should have occasion for his service. So he, perceiving that\r\nClaudius was in effect made Caesar already, went to him, who sent him as\r\nan ambassador to the senate, to let them know what his intentions were:\r\nthat, in the first place, it was without his seeking that he was hurried\r\naway by the soldiers; moreover, that he thought it was not just to\r\ndesert those soldiers in such their zeal for him, and that if he should\r\ndo so, his own fortune would be in uncertainty; for that it was a\r\ndangerous case to have been once called to the empire. He added further,\r\nthat he would administer the government as a good prince, and not like\r\na tyrant; for that he would be satisfied with the honor of being called\r\nemperor, but would, in every one of his actions, permit them all to\r\ngive him their advice; for that although he had not been by nature\r\nfor moderation, yet would the death of Caius afford him a sufficient\r\ndemonstration how soberly he ought to act in that station.\r\n\r\n3. This message was delivered by Agrippa; to which the senate replied,\r\nthat since they had an army, and the wisest counsels on their side,\r\nthey would not endure a voluntary slavery. And when Claudius heard what\r\nanswer the senate had made, he sent Agrippa to them again, with the\r\nfollowing message: That he could not bear the thoughts of betraying them\r\nthat had given their oaths to be true to him; and that he saw he must\r\nfight, though unwillingly, against such as he had no mind to fight;\r\nthat, however, [if it must come to that,] it was proper to choose a\r\nplace without the city for the war, because it was not agreeable to\r\npiety to pollute the temples of their own city with the blood of their\r\nown countrymen, and this only on occasion of their imprudent conduct.\r\nAnd when Agrippa had heard this message, he delivered it to the\r\nsenators.\r\n\r\n4. In the mean time, one of the soldiers belonging to the senate drew\r\nhis sword, and cried out, \"O my fellow soldiers, what is the meaning of\r\nthis choice of ours, to kill our brethren, and to use violence to our\r\nkindred that are with Claudius? while we may have him for our emperor\r\nwhom no one can blame, and who hath so many just reasons [to lay claim\r\nto the government]; and this with regard to those against whom we are\r\ngoing to fight.\" When he had said this, he marched through the whole\r\nsenate, and carried all the soldiers along with him. Upon which all\r\nthe patricians were immediately in a great fright at their being thus\r\ndeserted. But still, because there appeared no other way whither they\r\ncould turn themselves for deliverance, they made haste the same way with\r\nthe soldiers, and went to Claudius. But those that had the greatest luck\r\nin flattering the good fortune of Claudius betimes met them before the\r\nwalls with their naked swords, and there was reason to fear that those\r\nthat came first might have been in danger, before Claudius could know\r\nwhat violence the soldiers were going to offer them, had not Agrippa ran\r\nbefore, and told him what a dangerous thing they were going about, and\r\nthat unless he restrained the violence of these men, who were in a fit\r\nof madness against the patricians, he would lose those on whose account\r\nit was most desirable to rule, and would be emperor over a desert.\r\n\r\n5. When Claudius heard this, he restrained the violence of the soldiery,\r\nand received the senate into the camp, and treated them after an\r\nobliging manner, and went out with them presently to offer their\r\nthank-offerings to God, which were proper upon, his first coming to\r\nthe empire. Moreover, he bestowed on Agrippa his whole paternal kingdom\r\nimmediately, and added to it, besides those countries that had been\r\ngiven by Augustus to Herod, Trachonitis and Auranitis, and still besides\r\nthese, that kingdom which was called the kingdom of Lysanius. This gift\r\nhe declared to the people by a decree, but ordered the magistrates to\r\nhave the donation engraved on tables of brass, and to be set up in the\r\ncapitol. He bestowed on his brother Herod, who was also his son-in-law,\r\nby marrying [his daughter] Bernice, the kingdom of Chalcis.\r\n\r\n6. So now riches flowed in to Agrippa by his enjoyment of so large a\r\ndominion; nor did he abuse the money he had on small matters, but\r\nhe began to encompass Jerusalem with such a wall, which, had it been\r\nbrought to perfection, had made it impracticable for the Romans to take\r\nit by siege; but his death, which happened at Cesarea, before he had\r\nraised the walls to their due height, prevented him. He had then reigned\r\nthree years, as he had governed his tetrarchies three other years.\r\nHe left behind him three daughters, born to him by Cypros, Bernice,\r\nMariamne, and Drusilla, and a son born of the same mother, whose name\r\nwas Agrippa: he was left a very young child, so that Claudius made the\r\ncountry a Roman province, and sent Cuspius Fadus to be its procurator,\r\nand after him Tiberius Alexander, who, making no alterations of the\r\nancient laws, kept the nation in tranquillity. Now after this, Herod the\r\nking of Chalcis died, and left behind him two sons, born to him of his\r\nbrother's daughter Bernice; their names were Bernie Janus and Hyrcanus.\r\n[He also left behind him] Aristobulus, whom he had by his former wife\r\nMariamne. There was besides another brother of his that died a private\r\nperson, his name was also Aristobulus, who left behind him a daughter,\r\nwhose name was Jotape: and these, as I have formerly said, were\r\nthe children of Aristobulus the son of Herod, which Aristobulus and\r\nAlexander were born to Herod by Mariamne, and were slain by him. But as\r\nfor Alexander's posterity, they reigned in Armenia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Many Tumults Under Cumanus, Which Were Composed By\r\n     Quadratus. Felix Is Procurator Of Judea. Agrippa Is Advanced\r\n     From Chalcis To A Greater Kingdom.\r\n\r\n1 Now after the death of Herod, king of Chalcis, Claudius set Agrippa,\r\nthe son of Agrippa, over his uncle's kingdom, while Cumanus took upon\r\nhim the office of procurator of the rest, which was a Roman province,\r\nand therein he succeeded Alexander; under which Cumanus began the\r\ntroubles, and the Jews' ruin came on; for when the multitude were come\r\ntogether to Jerusalem, to the feast of unleavened bread, and a Roman\r\ncohort stood over the cloisters of the temple, [for they always were\r\narmed, and kept guard at the festivals, to prevent any innovation which\r\nthe multitude thus gathered together might make,] one of the soldiers\r\npulled back his garment, and cowering down after an indecent manner,\r\nturned his breech to the Jews, and spake such words as you might expect\r\nupon such a posture. At this the whole multitude had indignation, and\r\nmade a clamor to Cumanus, that he would punish the soldier; while\r\nthe rasher part of the youth, and such as were naturally the most\r\ntumultuous, fell to fighting, and caught up stones, and threw them at\r\nthe soldiers. Upon which Cumanus was afraid lest all the people should\r\nmake an assault upon him, and sent to call for more armed men, who, when\r\nthey came in great numbers into the cloisters, the Jews were in a very\r\ngreat consternation; and being beaten out of the temple, they ran into\r\nthe city; and the violence with which they crowded to get out was so\r\ngreat, that they trod upon each other, and squeezed one another, till\r\nten thousand of them were killed, insomuch that this feast became the\r\ncause of mourning to the whole nation, and every family lamented their\r\nown relations.\r\n\r\n2. Now there followed after this another calamity, which arose from\r\na tumult made by robbers; for at the public road at Beth-boron, one\r\nStephen, a servant of Caesar, carried some furniture, which the robbers\r\nfell upon and seized. Upon this Cumanus sent men to go round about to\r\nthe neighboring villages, and to bring their inhabitants to him bound,\r\nas laying it to their charge that they had not pursued after the\r\nthieves, and caught them. Now here it was that a certain soldier,\r\nfinding the sacred book of the law, tore it to pieces, and threw it into\r\nthe fire. 14 Hereupon the Jews were in great disorder, as if their whole\r\ncountry were in a flame, and assembled themselves so many of them by\r\ntheir zeal for their religion, as by an engine, and ran together with\r\nunited clamor to Cesarea, to Cumanus, and made supplication to him that\r\nhe would not overlook this man, who had offered such an affront to God,\r\nand to his law; but punish him for what he had done. Accordingly, he,\r\nperceiving that the multitude would not be quiet unless they had a\r\ncomfortable answer from him, gave order that the soldier should be\r\nbrought, and drawn through those that required to have him punished, to\r\nexecution, which being done, the Jews went their ways.\r\n\r\n3. After this there happened a fight between the Galileans and the\r\nSamaritans; it happened at a village called Geman, which is situate in\r\nthe great plain of Samaria; where, as a great number of Jews were going\r\nup to Jerusalem to the feast [of tabernacles,] a certain Galilean was\r\nslain; and besides, a vast number of people ran together out of Galilee,\r\nin order to fight with the Samaritans. But the principal men among\r\nthem came to Cumanus, and besought him that, before the evil became\r\nincurable, he would come into Galilee, and bring the authors of this\r\nmurder to punishment; for that there was no other way to make the\r\nmultitude separate without coming to blows. However, Cumanus postponed\r\ntheir supplications to the other affairs he was then about, and sent the\r\npetitioners away without success.\r\n\r\n4. But when the affair of this murder came to be told at Jerusalem, it\r\nput the multitude into disorder, and they left the feast; and without\r\nany generals to conduct them, they marched with great violence to\r\nSamaria; nor would they be ruled by any of the magistrates that were set\r\nover them, but they were managed by one Eleazar, the son of Dineus, and\r\nby Alexander, in these their thievish and seditious attempts. These\r\nmen fell upon those that were in the neighborhood of the Acrabatene\r\ntoparchy, and slew them, without sparing any age, and set the villages\r\non fire.\r\n\r\n5. But Cumanus took one troop of horsemen, called the troop of Sebaste,\r\nout of Cesarea, and came to the assistance of those that were spoiled;\r\nhe also seized upon a great number of those that followed Eleazar, and\r\nslew more of them. And as for the rest of the multitude of those that\r\nwent so zealously to fight with the Samaritans, the rulers of Jerusalem\r\nran out clothed with sackcloth, and having ashes on their head, and\r\nbegged of them to go their ways, lest by their attempt to revenge\r\nthemselves upon the Samaritans they should provoke the Romans to come\r\nagainst Jerusalem; to have compassion upon their country and temple,\r\ntheir children and their wives, and not bring the utmost dangers of\r\ndestruction upon them, in order to avenge themselves upon one Galilean\r\nonly. The Jews complied with these persuasions of theirs, and dispersed\r\nthemselves; but still there were a great number who betook themselves\r\nto robbing, in hopes of impunity; and rapines and insurrections of the\r\nbolder sort happened over the whole country. And the men of power among\r\nthe Samaritans came to Tyre, to Ummidius Quadratus, 15 the president of\r\nSyria, and desired that they that had laid waste the country might be\r\npunished: the great men also of the Jews, and Jonathan the son of Ananus\r\nthe high priest, came thither, and said that the Samaritans were\r\nthe beginners of the disturbance, on account of that murder they had\r\ncommitted; and that Cumanus had given occasion to what had happened, by\r\nhis unwillingness to punish the original authors of that murder.\r\n\r\n6. But Quadratus put both parties off for that time, and told them, that\r\nwhen he should come to those places, he would make a diligent inquiry\r\nafter every circumstance. After which he went to Cesarea, and crucified\r\nall those whom Cumanus had taken alive; and when from thence he was come\r\nto the city Lydda, he heard the affair of the Samaritans, and sent for\r\neighteen of the Jews, whom he had learned to have been concerned in that\r\nfight, and beheaded them; but he sent two others of those that were of\r\nthe greatest power among them, and both Jonathan and Ananias, the high\r\npriests, as also Artanus the son of this Ananias, and certain others\r\nthat were eminent among the Jews, to Caesar; as he did in like manner\r\nby the most illustrious of the Samaritans. He also ordered that Cumanus\r\n[the procurator] and Celer the tribune should sail to Rome, in order to\r\ngive an account of what had been done to Caesar. When he had finished\r\nthese matters, he went up from Lydda to Jerusalem, and finding the\r\nmultitude celebrating their feast of unleavened bread without any\r\ntumult, he returned to Antioch.\r\n\r\n7. Now when Caesar at Rome had heard what Cumanus and the Samaritans\r\nhad to say, [where it was done in the hearing of Agrippa, who zealously\r\nespoused the cause of the Jews, as in like manner many of the great men\r\nstood by Cumanus,] he condemned the Samaritans, and commanded that three\r\nof the most powerful men among them should be put to death; he banished\r\nCumanus, and sent Celer bound to Jerusalem, to be delivered over to the\r\nJews to be tormented; that he should be drawn round the city, and then\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\n8. After this Caesar sent Felix, 16 the brother of Pallas, to be\r\nprocurator of Galilee, and Samaria, and Perea, and removed Agrippa from\r\nChalcis unto a greater kingdom; for he gave him the tetrarchy which\r\nhad belonged to Philip, which contained Batanae, Trachonitis, and\r\nGaulonitis: he added to it the kingdom of Lysanias, and that province\r\n[Abilene] which Varus had governed. But Claudius himself, when he had\r\nadministered the government thirteen years, eight months, and twenty\r\ndays, died, and left Nero to be his successor in the empire, whom he had\r\nadopted by his Wife Agrippina's delusions, in order to be his successor,\r\nalthough he had a son of his own, whose name was Britannicus, by\r\nMessalina his former wife, and a daughter whose name was Octavia, whom\r\nhe had married to Nero; he had also another daughter by Petina, whose\r\nname was Antonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Nero Adds Four Cities To Agrippas Kingdom; But The Other\r\n     Parts Of Judea Were Under Felix. The Disturbances Which Were\r\n     Raised By The Sicarii The Magicians And An Egyptian False\r\n     Prophet. The Jews And Syrians Have A Contest At Cesarea.\r\n\r\n1. Now as to the many things in which Nero acted like a madman, out of\r\nthe extravagant degree of the felicity and riches which he enjoyed, and\r\nby that means used his good fortune to the injury of others; and after\r\nwhat manner he slew his brother, and wife, and mother, from whom his\r\nbarbarity spread itself to others that were most nearly related to him;\r\nand how, at last, he was so distracted that he became an actor in\r\nthe scenes, and upon the theater,--I omit to say any more about them,\r\nbecause there are writers enough upon those subjects every where; but\r\nI shall turn myself to those actions of his time in which the Jews were\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n2. Nero therefore bestowed the kingdom of the Lesser Armenia upon\r\nAristobulus, Herod's son, 17 and he added to Agrippa's kingdom four\r\ncities, with the toparchies to them belonging; I mean Abila, and that\r\nJulias which is in Perea, Tarichea also, and Tiberias of Galilee; but\r\nover the rest of Judea he made Felix procurator. This Felix took Eleazar\r\nthe arch-robber, and many that were with him, alive, when they had\r\nravaged the country for twenty years together, and sent them to Rome;\r\nbut as to the number of the robbers whom he caused to be crucified, and\r\nof those who were caught among them, and whom he brought to punishment,\r\nthey were a multitude not to be enumerated.\r\n\r\n3. When the country was purged of these, there sprang up another sort of\r\nrobbers in Jerusalem, which were called Sicarii, who slew men in the\r\nday time, and in the midst of the city; this they did chiefly at\r\nthe festivals, when they mingled themselves among the multitude, and\r\nconcealed daggers under their garments, with which they stabbed those\r\nthat were their enemies; and when any fell down dead, the murderers\r\nbecame a part of those that had indignation against them; by which means\r\nthey appeared persons of such reputation, that they could by no means\r\nbe discovered. The first man who was slain by them was Jonathan the high\r\npriest, after whose death many were slain every day, while the fear men\r\nwere in of being so served was more afflicting than the calamity itself;\r\nand while every body expected death every hour, as men do in war, so men\r\nwere obliged to look before them, and to take notice of their enemies at\r\na great distance; nor, if their friends were coming to them, durst\r\nthey trust them any longer; but, in the midst of their suspicions and\r\nguarding of themselves, they were slain. Such was the celerity of the\r\nplotters against them, and so cunning was their contrivance.\r\n\r\n4. There was also another body of wicked men gotten together, not so\r\nimpure in their actions, but more wicked in their intentions, which\r\nlaid waste the happy state of the city no less than did these murderers.\r\nThese were such men as deceived and deluded the people under pretense\r\nof Divine inspiration, but were for procuring innovations and changes\r\nof the government; and these prevailed with the multitude to act like\r\nmadmen, and went before them into the wilderness, as pretending that\r\nGod would there show them the signals of liberty. But Felix thought this\r\nprocedure was to be the beginning of a revolt; so he sent some horsemen\r\nand footmen both armed, who destroyed a great number of them.\r\n\r\n5. But there was an Egyptian false prophet that did the Jews more\r\nmischief than the former; for he was a cheat, and pretended to be a\r\nprophet also, and got together thirty thousand men that were deluded by\r\nhim; these he led round about from the wilderness to the mount which\r\nwas called the Mount of Olives, and was ready to break into Jerusalem\r\nby force from that place; and if he could but once conquer the Roman\r\ngarrison and the people, he intended to domineer over them by the\r\nassistance of those guards of his that were to break into the city\r\nwith him. But Felix prevented his attempt, and met him with his Roman\r\nsoldiers, while all the people assisted him in his attack upon them,\r\ninsomuch that when it came to a battle, the Egyptian ran away, with a\r\nfew others, while the greatest part of those that were with him were\r\neither destroyed or taken alive; but the rest of the multitude were\r\ndispersed every one to their own homes, and there concealed themselves.\r\n\r\n6. Now when these were quieted, it happened, as it does in a diseased\r\nbody, that another part was subject to an inflammation; for a company\r\nof deceivers and robbers got together, and persuaded the Jews to revolt,\r\nand exhorted them to assert their liberty, inflicting death on those\r\nthat continued in obedience to the Roman government, and saying, that\r\nsuch as willingly chose slavery ought to be forced from such their\r\ndesired inclinations; for they parted themselves into different bodies,\r\nand lay in wait up and down the country, and plundered the houses of the\r\ngreat men, and slew the men themselves, and set the villages on fire;\r\nand this till all Judea was filled with the effects of their madness.\r\nAnd thus the flame was every day more and more blown up, till it came to\r\na direct war.\r\n\r\n7. There was also another disturbance at Cesarea,--those Jews who were\r\nmixed with the Syrians that lived there rising a tumult against them.\r\nThe Jews pretended that the city was theirs, and said that he who built\r\nit was a Jew, meaning king Herod. The Syrians confessed also that its\r\nbuilder was a Jew; but they still said, however, that the city was a\r\nGrecian city; for that he who set up statues and temples in it could not\r\ndesign it for Jews. On which account both parties had a contest with\r\none another; and this contest increased so much, that it came at last to\r\narms, and the bolder sort of them marched out to fight; for the elders\r\nof the Jews were not able to put a stop to their own people that were\r\ndisposed to be tumultuous, and the Greeks thought it a shame for them\r\nto be overcome by the Jews. Now these Jews exceeded the others in\r\nriches and strength of body; but the Grecian part had the advantage\r\nof assistance from the soldiery; for the greatest part of the Roman\r\ngarrison was raised out of Syria; and being thus related to the Syrian\r\npart, they were ready to assist it. However, the governors of the city\r\nwere concerned to keep all quiet, and whenever they caught those that\r\nwere most for fighting on either side, they punished them with stripes\r\nand bands. Yet did not the sufferings of those that were caught affright\r\nthe remainder, or make them desist; but they were still more and more\r\nexasperated, and deeper engaged in the sedition. And as Felix came once\r\ninto the market-place, and commanded the Jews, when they had beaten the\r\nSyrians, to go their ways, and threatened them if they would not, and\r\nthey would not obey him, he sent his soldiers out upon them, and slew\r\na great many of them, upon which it fell out that what they had was\r\nplundered. And as the sedition still continued, he chose out the most\r\neminent men on both sides as ambassadors to Nero, to argue about their\r\nseveral privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Festus Succeeds Felix Who Is Succeeded By Albinus As He Is\r\n     By Florus; Who By The Barbarity Of His Government Forces The\r\n     Jews Into The War.\r\n\r\n1. Now it was that Festus succeeded Felix as procurator, and made it his\r\nbusiness to correct those that made disturbances in the country. So he\r\ncaught the greatest part of the robbers, and destroyed a great many of\r\nthem. But then Albinus, who succeeded Festus, did not execute his office\r\nas the other had done; nor was there any sort of wickedness that could\r\nbe named but he had a hand in it. Accordingly, he did not only, in his\r\npolitical capacity, steal and plunder every one's substance, nor did he\r\nonly burden the whole nation with taxes, but he permitted the relations\r\nof such as were in prison for robbery, and had been laid there, either\r\nby the senate of every city, or by the former procurators, to redeem\r\nthem for money; and no body remained in the prisons as a malefactor but\r\nhe who gave him nothing. At this time it was that the enterprises of\r\nthe seditious at Jerusalem were very formidable; the principal men\r\namong them purchasing leave of Albinus to go on with their seditious\r\npractices; while that part of the people who delighted in disturbances\r\njoined themselves to such as had fellowship with Albinus; and every one\r\nof these wicked wretches were encompassed with his own band of robbers,\r\nwhile he himself, like an arch-robber, or a tyrant, made a figure among\r\nhis company, and abused his authority over those about him, in order\r\nto plunder those that lived quietly. The effect of which was this, that\r\nthose who lost their goods were forced to hold their peace, when they\r\nhad reason to show great indignation at what they had suffered; but\r\nthose who had escaped were forced to flatter him that deserved to be\r\npunished, out of the fear they were in of suffering equally with the\r\nothers. Upon the Whole, nobody durst speak their minds, but tyranny\r\nwas generally tolerated; and at this time were those seeds sown which\r\nbrought the city to destruction.\r\n\r\n2. And although such was the character of Albinus, yet did Gessius\r\nFlorus 18 who succeeded him, demonstrate him to have been a most\r\nexcellent person, upon the comparison; for the former did the greatest\r\npart of his rogueries in private, and with a sort of dissimulation; but\r\nGessius did his unjust actions to the harm of the nation after a pompous\r\nmanner; and as though he had been sent as an executioner to punish\r\ncondemned malefactors, he omitted no sort of rapine, or of vexation;\r\nwhere the case was really pitiable, he was most barbarous, and in things\r\nof the greatest turpitude he was most impudent. Nor could any one outdo\r\nhim in disguising the truth; nor could any one contrive more subtle ways\r\nof deceit than he did. He indeed thought it but a petty offense to get\r\nmoney out of single persons; so he spoiled whole cities, and ruined\r\nentire bodies of men at once, and did almost publicly proclaim it all\r\nthe country over, that they had liberty given them to turn robbers, upon\r\nthis condition, that he might go shares with them in the spoils they\r\ngot. Accordingly, this his greediness of gain was the occasion that\r\nentire toparchies were brought to desolation, and a great many of the\r\npeople left their own country, and fled into foreign provinces.\r\n\r\n3. And truly, while Cestius Gallus was president of the province of\r\nSyria, nobody durst do so much as send an embassage to him against\r\nFlorus; but when he was come to Jerusalem, upon the approach of the\r\nfeast of unleavened bread, the people came about him not fewer in number\r\nthan three millions 19 these besought him to commiserate the calamities\r\nof their nation, and cried out upon Florus as the bane of their country.\r\nBut as he was present, and stood by Cestius, he laughed at their words.\r\nHowever, Cestius, when he had quieted the multitude, and had assured\r\nthem that he would take care that Florus should hereafter treat them in\r\na more gentle manner, returned to Antioch. Florus also conducted him\r\nas far as Cesarea, and deluded him, though he had at that very time the\r\npurpose of showing his anger at the nation, and procuring a war upon\r\nthem, by which means alone it was that he supposed he might conceal his\r\nenormities; for he expected that if the peace continued, he should have\r\nthe Jews for his accusers before Caesar; but that if he could procure\r\nthem to make a revolt, he should divert their laying lesser crimes to\r\nhis charge, by a misery that was so much greater; he therefore did every\r\nday augment their calamities, in order to induce them to a rebellion.\r\n\r\n4. Now at this time it happened that the Grecians at Cesarea had been\r\ntoo hard for the Jews, and had obtained of Nero the government of the\r\ncity, and had brought the judicial determination: at the same time began\r\nthe war, in the twelfth year of the reign of Nero, and the seventeenth\r\nof the reign of Agrippa, in the month of Artemisius [Jyar.] Now the\r\noccasion of this war was by no means proportionable to those heavy\r\ncalamities which it brought upon us. For the Jews that dwelt at Cesarea\r\nhad a synagogue near the place, whose owner was a certain Cesarean\r\nGreek: the Jews had endeavored frequently to have purchased the\r\npossession of the place, and had offered many times its value for its\r\nprice; but as the owner overlooked their offers, so did he raise\r\nother buildings upon the place, in way of affront to them, and made\r\nworking-shops of them, and left them but a narrow passage, and such as\r\nwas very troublesome for them to go along to their synagogue. Whereupon\r\nthe warmer part of the Jewish youth went hastily to the workmen, and\r\nforbade them to build there; but as Florus would not permit them to use\r\nforce, the great men of the Jews, with John the publican, being in the\r\nutmost distress what to do, persuaded Florus, with the offer of eight\r\ntalents, to hinder the work. He then, being intent upon nothing but\r\ngetting money, promised he would do for them all they desired of him,\r\nand then went away from Cesarea to Sebaste, and left the sedition to\r\ntake its full course, as if he had sold a license to the Jews to fight\r\nit out.\r\n\r\n5. Now on the next day, which was the seventh day of the week, when the\r\nJews were crowding apace to their synagogue, a certain man of Cesarea,\r\nof a seditious temper, got an earthen vessel, and set it with the bottom\r\nupward, at the entrance of that synagogue, and sacrificed birds. This\r\nthing provoked the Jews to an incurable degree, because their laws were\r\naffronted, and the place was polluted. Whereupon the sober and moderate\r\npart of the Jews thought it proper to have recourse to their governors\r\nagain, while the seditious part, and such as were in the fervor of their\r\nyouth, were vehemently inflamed to fight. The seditions also among the\r\nGentiles of Cesarea stood ready for the same purpose; for they had, by\r\nagreement, sent the man to sacrifice beforehand [as ready to support\r\nhim;] so that it soon came to blows. Hereupon Jucundus, the master of\r\nthe horse, who was ordered to prevent the fight, came thither, and took\r\naway the earthen vessel, and endeavored to put a stop to the sedition;\r\nbut when 20 he was overcome by the violence of the people of Cesarea,\r\nthe Jews caught up their books of the law, and retired to Narbata, which\r\nwas a place to them belonging, distant from Cesarea sixty furlongs.\r\nBut John, and twelve of the principal men with him, went to Florus, to\r\nSebaste, and made a lamentable complaint of their case, and besought\r\nhim to help them; and with all possible decency, put him in mind of the\r\neight talents they had given him; but he had the men seized upon, and\r\nput in prison, and accused them for carrying the books of the law out of\r\nCesarea.\r\n\r\n6. Moreover, as to the citizens of Jerusalem, although they took this\r\nmatter very ill, yet did they restrain their passion; but Florus acted\r\nherein as if he had been hired, and blew up the war into a flame, and\r\nsent some to take seventeen talents out of the sacred treasure, and\r\npretended that Caesar wanted them. At this the people were in confusion\r\nimmediately, and ran together to the temple, with prodigious clamors,\r\nand called upon Caesar by name, and besought him to free them from the\r\ntyranny of Florus. Some also of the seditious cried out upon Florus, and\r\ncast the greatest reproaches upon him, and carried a basket about, and\r\nbegged some spills of money for him, as for one that was destitute of\r\npossessions, and in a miserable condition. Yet was not he made ashamed\r\nhereby of his love of money, but was more enraged, and provoked to get\r\nstill more; and instead of coming to Cesarea, as he ought to have done,\r\nand quenching the flame of war, which was beginning thence, and so\r\ntaking away the occasion of any disturbances, on which account it was\r\nthat he had received a reward [of eight talents], he marched hastily\r\nwith an army of horsemen and footmen against Jerusalem, that he might\r\ngain his will by the arms of the Romans, and might, by his terror, and\r\nby his threatenings, bring the city into subjection.\r\n\r\n7. But the people were desirous of making Florus ashamed of his attempt,\r\nand met his soldiers with acclamations, and put themselves in order\r\nto receive him very submissively. But he sent Capito, a centurion,\r\nbeforehand, with fifty soldiers, to bid them go back, and not now make\r\na show of receiving him in an obliging manner, whom they had so foully\r\nreproached before; and said that it was incumbent on them, in case they\r\nhad generous souls, and were free speakers, to jest upon him to his\r\nface, and appear to be lovers of liberty, not only in words, but with\r\ntheir weapons also. With this message was the multitude amazed; and\r\nupon the coming of Capito's horsemen into the midst of them, they were\r\ndispersed before they could salute Florus, or manifest their submissive\r\nbehavior to him. Accordingly, they retired to their own houses, and\r\nspent that night in fear and confusion of face.\r\n\r\n8. Now at this time Florus took up his quarters at the palace; and on\r\nthe next day he had his tribunal set before it, and sat upon it, when\r\nthe high priests, and the men of power, and those of the greatest\r\neminence in the city, came all before that tribunal; upon which Florus\r\ncommanded them to deliver up to him those that had reproached him, and\r\ntold them that they should themselves partake of the vengeance to them\r\nbelonging, if they did not produce the criminals; but these demonstrated\r\nthat the people were peaceably disposed, and they begged forgiveness for\r\nthose that had spoken amiss; for that it was no wonder at all that in\r\nso great a multitude there should be some more daring than they ought to\r\nbe, and, by reason of their younger age, foolish also; and that it was\r\nimpossible to distinguish those that offended from the rest, while every\r\none was sorry for what he had done, and denied it out of fear of what\r\nwould follow: that he ought, however, to provide for the peace of the\r\nnation, and to take such counsels as might preserve the city for the\r\nRomans, and rather for the sake of a great number of innocent people to\r\nforgive a few that were guilty, than for the sake of a few of the wicked\r\nto put so large and good a body of men into disorder.\r\n\r\n9. Florus was more provoked at this, and called out aloud to the\r\nsoldiers to plunder that which was called the Upper Market-place, and to\r\nslay such as they met with. So the soldiers, taking this exhortation of\r\ntheir commander in a sense agreeable to their desire of gain, did not\r\nonly plunder the place they were sent to, but forcing themselves into\r\nevery house, they slew its inhabitants; so the citizens fled along\r\nthe narrow lanes, and the soldiers slew those that they caught, and\r\nno method of plunder was omitted; they also caught many of the quiet\r\npeople, and brought them before Florus, whom he first chastised with\r\nstripes, and then crucified. Accordingly, the whole number of those that\r\nwere destroyed that day, with their wives and children, [for they did\r\nnot spare even the infants themselves,] was about three thousand and six\r\nhundred. And what made this calamity the heavier was this new method\r\nof Roman barbarity; for Florus ventured then to do what no one had done\r\nbefore, that is, to have men of the equestrian order whipped 21 and\r\nnailed to the cross before his tribunal; who, although they were by\r\nbirth Jews, yet were they of Roman dignity notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning Bernice's Petition To Florus, To Spare The Jews,\r\n     But In Vain; As Also How, After The Seditious Flame Was\r\n     Quenched, It Was Kindled Again By Florus.\r\n\r\n1. About this very time king Agrippa was going to Alexandria, to\r\ncongratulate Alexander upon his having obtained the government of Egypt\r\nfrom Nero; but as his sister Bernice was come to Jerusalem, and saw the\r\nwicked practices of the soldiers, she was sorely affected at it, and\r\nfrequently sent the masters of her horse and her guards to Florus, and\r\nbegged of him to leave off these slaughters; but he would not comply\r\nwith her request, nor have any regard either to the multitude of those\r\nalready slain, or to the nobility of her that interceded, but only to\r\nthe advantage he should make by this plundering; nay, this violence of\r\nthe soldiers brake out to such a degree of madness, that it spent itself\r\non the queen herself; for they did not only torment and destroy those\r\nwhom they had caught under her very eyes, but indeed had killed herself\r\nalso, unless she had prevented them by flying to the palace, and had\r\nstaid there all night with her guards, which she had about her for fear\r\nof an insult from the soldiers. Now she dwelt then at Jerusalem, in\r\norder to perform a vow 22 which she had made to God; for it is usual\r\nwith those that had been either afflicted with a distemper, or with any\r\nother distresses, to make vows; and for thirty days before they are to\r\noffer their sacrifices, to abstain from wine, and to shave the hair of\r\ntheir head. Which things Bernice was now performing, and stood barefoot\r\nbefore Florus's tribunal, and besought him [to spare the Jews]. Yet\r\ncould she neither have any reverence paid to her, nor could she escape\r\nwithout some danger of being slain herself.\r\n\r\n2. This happened upon the sixteenth day of the month Artemisius [Jyar].\r\nNow, on the next day, the multitude, who were in a great agony, ran\r\ntogether to the Upper Market-place, and made the loudest lamentations\r\nfor those that had perished; and the greatest part of the cries were\r\nsuch as reflected on Florus; at which the men of power were affrighted,\r\ntogether with the high priests, and rent their garments, and fell down\r\nbefore each of them, and besought them to leave off, and not to provoke\r\nFlorus to some incurable procedure, besides what they had already\r\nsuffered. Accordingly, the multitude complied immediately, out of\r\nreverence to those that had desired it of them, and out of the hope they\r\nhad that Florus would do them no more injuries.\r\n\r\n3. So Florus was troubled that the disturbances were over, and\r\nendeavored to kindle that flame again, and sent for the high priests,\r\nwith the other eminent persons, and said the only demonstration that the\r\npeople would not make any other innovations should be this, that they\r\nmust go out and meet the soldiers that were ascending from Cesarea,\r\nwhence two cohorts were coming; and while these men were exhorting\r\nthe multitude so to do, he sent beforehand, and gave directions to the\r\ncenturions of the cohorts, that they should give notice to those that\r\nwere under them not to return the Jews' salutations; and that if they\r\nmade any reply to his disadvantage, they should make use of their\r\nweapons. Now the high priests assembled the multitude in the temple, and\r\ndesired them to go and meet the Romans, and to salute the cohorts very\r\ncivilly, before their miserable case should become incurable. Now\r\nthe seditious part would not comply with these persuasions; but the\r\nconsideration of those that had been destroyed made them incline to\r\nthose that were the boldest for action.\r\n\r\n4. At this time it was that every priest, and every servant of God,\r\nbrought out the holy vessels, and the ornamental garments wherein they\r\nused to minister in sacred things. The harpers also, and the singers of\r\nhymns, came out with their instruments of music, and fell down before\r\nthe multitude, and begged of them that they would preserve those holy\r\nornaments to them, and not provoke the Romans to carry off those sacred\r\ntreasures. You might also see then the high priests themselves, with\r\ndust sprinkled in great plenty upon their heads, with bosoms deprived of\r\nany covering but what was rent; these besought every one of the eminent\r\nmen by name, and the multitude in common, that they would not for a\r\nsmall offense betray their country to those that were desirous to have\r\nit laid waste; saying, \"What benefit will it bring to the soldiers to\r\nhave a salutation from the Jews? or what amendment of your affairs will\r\nit bring you, if you do not now go out to meet them? and that if they\r\nsaluted them civilly, all handle would be cut off from Florus to begin\r\na war; that they should thereby gain their country, and freedom from all\r\nfurther sufferings; and that, besides, it would be a sign of great\r\nwant of command of themselves, if they should yield to a few seditious\r\npersons, while it was fitter for them who were so great a people to\r\nforce the others to act soberly.\"\r\n\r\n5. By these persuasions, which they used to the multitude and to the\r\nseditious, they restrained some by threatenings, and others by the\r\nreverence that was paid them. After this they led them out, and they met\r\nthe soldiers quietly, and after a composed manner, and when they were\r\ncome up with them, they saluted them; but when they made no answer,\r\nthe seditious exclaimed against Florus, which was the signal given for\r\nfalling upon them. The soldiers therefore encompassed them presently,\r\nand struck them with their clubs; and as they fled away, the horsemen\r\ntrampled them down, so that a great many fell down dead by the strokes\r\nof the Romans, and more by their own violence in crushing one another.\r\nNow there was a terrible crowding about the gates, and while every\r\nbody was making haste to get before another, the flight of them all was\r\nretarded, and a terrible destruction there was among those that fell\r\ndown, for they were suffocated, and broken to pieces by the multitude of\r\nthose that were uppermost; nor could any of them be distinguished by\r\nhis relations in order to the care of his funeral; the soldiers also who\r\nbeat them, fell upon those whom they overtook, without showing them any\r\nmercy, and thrust the multitude through the place called Bezetha, 23 as\r\nthey forced their way, in order to get in and seize upon the temple, and\r\nthe tower Antonia. Florus also being desirous to get those places into\r\nhis possession, brought such as were with him out of the king's palace,\r\nand would have compelled them to get as far as the citadel [Antonia;]\r\nbut his attempt failed, for the people immediately turned back upon him,\r\nand stopped the violence of his attempt; and as they stood upon the tops\r\nof their houses, they threw their darts at the Romans, who, as they were\r\nsorely galled thereby, because those weapons came from above, and they\r\nwere not able to make a passage through the multitude, which stopped up\r\nthe narrow passages, they retired to the camp which was at the palace.\r\n\r\n6. But for the seditious, they were afraid lest Florus should come\r\nagain, and get possession of the temple, through Antonia; so they got\r\nimmediately upon those cloisters of the temple that joined to Antonia,\r\nand cut them down. This cooled the avarice of Florus; for whereas he\r\nwas eager to obtain the treasures of God [in the temple], and on that\r\naccount was desirous of getting into Antonia, as soon as the cloisters\r\nwere broken down, he left off his attempt; he then sent for the high\r\npriests and the sanhedrim, and told them that he was indeed himself\r\ngoing out of the city, but that he would leave them as large a garrison\r\nas they should desire. Hereupon they promised that they would make no\r\ninnovations, in case he would leave them one band; but not that which\r\nhad fought with the Jews, because the multitude bore ill-will against\r\nthat band on account of what they had suffered from it; so he changed\r\nthe band as they desired, and, with the rest of his forces, returned to\r\nCesarea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Cestius Sends Neopolitanus The Tribune To See In What\r\n     Condition The Affairs Of The Jews Were. Agrippa Makes A\r\n     Speech To The People Of The Jews That He May Divert Them\r\n     From Their Intentions Of Making War With The Romans.\r\n\r\n1. However, Florus contrived another way to oblige the Jews to begin\r\nthe war, and sent to Cestius, and accused the Jews falsely of revolting\r\n[from the Roman government], and imputed the beginning of the former\r\nfight to them, and pretended they had been the authors of that\r\ndisturbance, wherein they were only the sufferers. Yet were not the\r\ngovernors of Jerusalem silent upon this occasion, but did themselves\r\nwrite to Cestius, as did Bernice also, about the illegal practices of\r\nwhich Florus had been guilty against the city; who, upon reading both\r\naccounts, consulted with his captains [what he should do]. Now some\r\nof them thought it best for Cestius to go up with his army, either to\r\npunish the revolt, if it was real, or to settle the Roman affairs on a\r\nsurer foundation, if the Jews continued quiet under them; but he thought\r\nit best himself to send one of his intimate friends beforehand, to\r\nsee the state of affairs, and to give him a faithful account of the\r\nintentions of the Jews. Accordingly, he sent one of his tribunes, whose\r\nname was Neopolitanus, who met with king Agrippa as he was returning\r\nfrom Alexandria, at Jamnia, and told him who it was that sent him, and\r\non what errands he was sent.\r\n\r\n2. And here it was that the high priests, and men of power among the\r\nJews, as well as the sanhedrim, came to congratulate the king [upon his\r\nsafe return]; and after they had paid him their respects, they lamented\r\ntheir own calamities, and related to him what barbarous treatment\r\nthey had met with from Florus. At which barbarity Agrippa had great\r\nindignation, but transferred, after a subtle manner, his anger towards\r\nthose Jews whom he really pitied, that he might beat down their high\r\nthoughts of themselves, and would have them believe that they had\r\nnot been so unjustly treated, in order to dissuade them from avenging\r\nthemselves. So these great men, as of better understanding than the\r\nrest, and desirous of peace, because of the possessions they had,\r\nunderstood that this rebuke which the king gave them was intended\r\nfor their good; but as to the people, they came sixty furlongs out of\r\nJerusalem, and congratulated both Agrippa and Neopolitanus; but the\r\nwives of those that had been slain came running first of all and\r\nlamenting. The people also, when they heard their mourning, fell into\r\nlamentations also, and besought Agrippa to assist them: they also\r\ncried out to Neopolitanus, and complained of the many miseries they had\r\nendured under Florus; and they showed them, when they were come into the\r\ncity, how the market-place was made desolate, and the houses plundered.\r\nThey then persuaded Neopolitanus, by the means of Agrippa, that he would\r\nwalk round the city, with one only servant, as far as Siloam, that he\r\nmight inform himself that the Jews submitted to all the rest of the\r\nRomans, and were only displeased at Florus, by reason of his exceeding\r\nbarbarity to them. So he walked round, and had sufficient experience\r\nof the good temper the people were in, and then went up to the temple,\r\nwhere he called the multitude together, and highly commended them for\r\ntheir fidelity to the Romans, and earnestly exhorted them to keep the\r\npeace; and having performed such parts of Divine worship at the temple\r\nas he was allowed to do, he returned to Cestius.\r\n\r\n3. But as for the multitude of the Jews, they addressed themselves to\r\nthe king, and to the high priests, and desired they might have leave to\r\nsend ambassadors to Nero against Florus, and not by their silence afford\r\na suspicion that they had been the occasions of such great slaughters\r\nas had been made, and were disposed to revolt, alleging that they\r\nshould seem to have been the first beginners of the war, if they did not\r\nprevent the report by showing who it was that began it; and it appeared\r\nopenly that they would not be quiet, if any body should hinder them\r\nfrom sending such an embassage. But Agrippa, although he thought it\r\ntoo dangerous a thing for them to appoint men to go as the accusers of\r\nFlorus, yet did he not think it fit for him to overlook them, as\r\nthey were in a disposition for war. He therefore called the multitude\r\ntogether into a large gallery, and placed his sister Bernice in the\r\nhouse of the Asamoneans, that she might be seen by them, [which house\r\nwas over the gallery, at the passage to the upper city, where the bridge\r\njoined the temple to the gallery,] and spake to them as follows:\r\n\r\n4.24 \"Had I perceived that you were all zealously disposed to go to war\r\nwith the Romans, and that the purer and more sincere part of the people\r\ndid not propose to live in peace, I had not come out to you, nor been\r\nso bold as to give you counsel; for all discourses that tend to persuade\r\nmen to do what they ought to do are superfluous, when the hearers are\r\nagreed to do the contrary. But because some are earnest to go to war\r\nbecause they are young, and without experience of the miseries it\r\nbrings, and because some are for it out of an unreasonable expectation\r\nof regaining their liberty, and because others hope to get by it, and\r\nare therefore earnestly bent upon it, that in the confusion of your\r\naffairs they may gain what belongs to those that are too weak to resist\r\nthem, I have thought proper to get you all together, and to say to\r\nyou what I think to be for your advantage; that so the former may grow\r\nwiser, and change their minds, and that the best men may come to no harm\r\nby the ill conduct of some others. And let not any one be tumultuous\r\nagainst me, in case what they hear me say do not please them; for as\r\nto those that admit of no cure, but are resolved upon a revolt, it\r\nwill still be in their power to retain the same sentiments after my\r\nexhortation is over; but still my discourse will fall to the ground,\r\neven with a relation to those that have a mind to hear me, unless\r\nyou will all keep silence. I am well aware that many make a tragical\r\nexclamation concerning the injuries that have been offered you by your\r\nprocurators, and concerning the glorious advantages of liberty; but\r\nbefore I begin the inquiry, who you are that must go to war, and who\r\nthey are against whom you must fight, I shall first separate those\r\npretenses that are by some connected together; for if you aim at\r\navenging yourselves on those that have done you injury, why do you\r\npretend this to be a war for recovering your liberty? but if you think\r\nall servitude intolerable, to what purpose serve your complaint against\r\nyour particular governors? for if they treated you with moderation, it\r\nwould still be equally an unworthy thing to be in servitude. Consider\r\nnow the several cases that may be supposed, how little occasion there is\r\nfor your going to war. Your first occasion is the accusations you have\r\nto make against your procurators; now here you ought to be submissive\r\nto those in authority, and not give them any provocation; but when\r\nyou reproach men greatly for small offenses, you excite those whom you\r\nreproach to be your adversaries; for this will only make them leave off\r\nhurting you privately, and with some degree of modesty, and to lay what\r\nyou have waste openly. Now nothing so much damps the force of strokes as\r\nbearing them with patience; and the quietness of those who are injured\r\ndiverts the injurious persons from afflicting. But let us take it for\r\ngranted that the Roman ministers are injurious to you, and are incurably\r\nsevere; yet are they not all the Romans who thus injure you; nor hath\r\nCaesar, against whom you are going to make war, injured you: it is not\r\nby their command that any wicked governor is sent to you; for they who\r\nare in the west cannot see those that are in the east; nor indeed is it\r\neasy for them there even to hear what is done in these parts. Now it is\r\nabsurd to make war with a great many for the sake of one, to do so with\r\nsuch mighty people for a small cause; and this when these people are not\r\nable to know of what you complain: nay, such crimes as we complain of\r\nmay soon be corrected, for the same procurator will not continue\r\nfor ever; and probable it is that the successors will come with more\r\nmoderate inclinations. But as for war, if it be once begun, it is not\r\neasily laid down again, nor borne without calamities coming therewith.\r\nHowever, as to the desire of recovering your liberty, it is unseasonable\r\nto indulge it so late; whereas you ought to have labored earnestly in\r\nold time that you might never have lost it; for the first experience of\r\nslavery was hard to be endured, and the struggle that you might never\r\nhave been subject to it would have been just; but that slave who hath\r\nbeen once brought into subjection, and then runs away, is rather a\r\nrefractory slave than a lover of liberty; for it was then the proper\r\ntime for doing all that was possible, that you might never have admitted\r\nthe Romans [into your city], when Pompey came first into the country.\r\nBut so it was, that our ancestors and their kings, who were in much\r\nbetter circumstances than we are, both as to money, and strong bodies,\r\nand [valiant] souls, did not bear the onset of a small body of the Roman\r\narmy. And yet you, who have now accustomed yourselves to obedience from\r\none generation to another, and who are so much inferior to those who\r\nfirst submitted, in your circumstances will venture to oppose the entire\r\nempire of the Romans. While those Athenians, who, in order to preserve\r\nthe liberty of Greece, did once set fire to their own city; who pursued\r\nXerxes, that proud prince, when he sailed upon the land, and walked upon\r\nthe sea, and could not be contained by the seas, but conducted such an\r\narmy as was too broad for Europe; and made him run away like a fugitive\r\nin a single ship, and brake so great a part of Asia at the Lesser\r\nSalamis; are yet at this time servants to the Romans; and those\r\ninjunctions which are sent from Italy become laws to the principal\r\ngoverning city of Greece. Those Lacedemonians also who got the great\r\nvictories at Thermopylae and Platea, and had Agesilaus [for their king],\r\nand searched every corner of Asia, are contented to admit the same\r\nlords. Those Macedonians also, who still fancy what great men their\r\nPhilip and Alexander were, and see that the latter had promised them\r\nthe empire over the world, these bear so great a change, and pay their\r\nobedience to those whom fortune hath advanced in their stead. Moreover,\r\nten thousand ether nations there are who had greater reason than we to\r\nclaim their entire liberty, and yet do submit. You are the only people\r\nwho think it a disgrace to be servants to those to whom all the world\r\nhath submitted. What sort of an army do you rely on? What are the arms\r\nyou depend on? Where is your fleet, that may seize upon the Roman\r\nseas? and where are those treasures which may be sufficient for your\r\nundertakings? Do you suppose, I pray you, that you are to make war with\r\nthe Egyptians, and with the Arabians? Will you not carefully reflect\r\nupon the Roman empire? Will you not estimate your own weakness? Hath not\r\nyour army been often beaten even by your neighboring nations, while the\r\npower of the Romans is invincible in all parts of the habitable earth?\r\nnay, rather they seek for somewhat still beyond that; for all Euphrates\r\nis not a sufficient boundary for them on the east side, nor the Danube\r\non the north; and for their southern limit, Libya hath been searched\r\nover by them, as far as countries uninhabited, as is Cadiz their limit\r\non the west; nay, indeed, they have sought for another habitable earth\r\nbeyond the ocean, and have carried their arms as far as such British\r\nislands as were never known before. What therefore do you pretend to?\r\nAre you richer than the Gauls, stronger than the Germans, wiser than\r\nthe Greeks, more numerous than all men upon the habitable earth? What\r\nconfidence is it that elevates you to oppose the Romans? Perhaps it will\r\nbe said, It is hard to endure slavery. Yes; but how much harder is this\r\nto the Greeks, who were esteemed the noblest of all people under the\r\nsun! These, though they inhabit in a large country, are in subjection to\r\nsix bundles of Roman rods. It is the same case with the Macedonians,\r\nwho have juster reason to claim their liberty than you have. What is\r\nthe case of five hundred cities of Asia? Do they not submit to a single\r\ngovernor, and to the consular bundle of rods? What need I speak of the\r\nHenlochi, and Colchi and the nation of Tauri, those that inhabit the\r\nBosphorus, and the nations about Pontus, and Meotis, who formerly\r\nknew not so much as a lord of their own, but are now subject to three\r\nthousand armed men, and where forty long ships keep the sea in peace,\r\nwhich before was not navigable, and very tempestuous? How strong a plea\r\nmay Bithynia, and Cappadocia, and the people of Pamphylia, the Lycians,\r\nand Cilicians, put in for liberty! But they are made tributary without\r\nan army. What are the circumstances of the Thracians, whose country\r\nextends in breadth five days' journey, and in length seven, and is of a\r\nmuch more harsh constitution, and much more defensible, than yours, and\r\nby the rigor of its cold sufficient to keep off armies from attacking\r\nthem? do not they submit to two thousand men of the Roman garrisons? Are\r\nnot the Illyrlans, who inhabit the country adjoining, as far as Dalmatia\r\nand the Danube, governed by barely two legions? by which also they put a\r\nstop to the incursions of the Daeians. And for the Dalmatians, who have\r\nmade such frequent insurrections in order to regain their liberty, and\r\nwho could never before be so thoroughly subdued, but that they always\r\ngathered their forces together again, revolted, yet are they now very\r\nquiet under one Roman legion. Moreover, great advantages might provoke\r\nany people to revolt, the Gauls might do it best of all, as being so\r\nthoroughly walled round by nature; on the east side by the Alps, on the\r\nnorth by the river Rhine, on the south by the Pyrenean mountains, and\r\non the west by the ocean. Now although these Gauls have such obstacles\r\nbefore them to prevent any attack upon them, and have no fewer than\r\nthree hundred and five nations among them, nay have, as one may say,\r\nthe fountains of domestic happiness within themselves, and send out\r\nplentiful streams of happiness over almost the whole world, these bear\r\nto be tributary to the Romans, and derive their prosperous condition\r\nfrom them; and they undergo this, not because they are of effeminate\r\nminds, or because they are of an ignoble stock, as having borne a war\r\nof eighty years in order to preserve their liberty; but by reason of\r\nthe great regard they have to the power of the Romans, and their good\r\nfortune, which is of greater efficacy than their arms. These Gauls,\r\ntherefore, are kept in servitude by twelve hundred soldiers, which are\r\nhardly so many as are their cities; nor hath the gold dug out of the\r\nmines of Spain been sufficient for the support of a war to preserve\r\ntheir liberty, nor could their vast distance from the Romans by land\r\nand by sea do it; nor could the martial tribes of the Lusitanians and\r\nSpaniards escape; no more could the ocean, with its tide, which yet was\r\nterrible to the ancient inhabitants. Nay, the Romans have extended their\r\narms beyond the pillars of Hercules, and have walked among the clouds,\r\nupon the Pyrenean mountains, and have subdued these nations. And one\r\nlegion is a sufficient guard for these people, although they were so\r\nhard to be conquered, and at a distance so remote from Rome. Who is\r\nthere among you that hath not heard of the great number of the Germans?\r\nYou have, to be sure, yourselves seen them to be strong and tall, and\r\nthat frequently, since the Romans have them among their captives every\r\nwhere; yet these Germans, who dwell in an immense country, who have\r\nminds greater than their bodies, and a soul that despises death, and\r\nwho are in rage more fierce than wild beasts, have the Rhine for the\r\nboundary of their enterprises, and are tamed by eight Roman legions.\r\nSuch of them as were taken captive became their servants; and the rest\r\nof the entire nation were obliged to save themselves by flight. Do you\r\nalso, who depend on the walls of Jerusalem, consider what a wall the\r\nBritons had; for the Romans sailed away to them, an subdued them while\r\nthey were encompassed by the ocean, and inhabited an island that is not\r\nless than the [continent of this] habitable earth; and four legions are\r\na sufficient guard to so large an island And why should I speak much\r\nmore about this matter, while the Parthians, that most warlike body\r\nof men, and lords of so many nations, and encompassed with such mighty\r\nforces, send hostages to the Romans? whereby you may see, if you please,\r\neven in Italy, the noblest nation of the East, under the notion of\r\npeace, submitting to serve them. Now when almost all people under the\r\nsun submit to the Roman arms, will you be the only people that make war\r\nagainst them? and this without regarding the fate of the Carthaginians,\r\nwho, in the midst of their brags of the great Hannibal, and the nobility\r\nof their Phoenician original, fell by the hand of Scipio. Nor indeed\r\nhave the Cyrenians, derived from the Lacedemonians, nor the Marmaridite,\r\na nation extended as far as the regions uninhabitable for want of\r\nwater, nor have the Syrtes, a place terrible to such as barely hear\r\nit described, the Nasamons and Moors, and the immense multitude of the\r\nNumidians, been able to put a stop to the Roman valor. And as for the\r\nthird part of the habitable earth, [Africa,] whose nations are so many\r\nthat it is not easy to number them, and which is bounded by the Atlantic\r\nSea and the pillars of Hercules, and feeds an innumerable multitude\r\nof Ethiopians, as far as the Red Sea, these have the Romans subdued\r\nentirely. And besides the annual fruits of the earth, which maintain\r\nthe multitude of the Romans for eight months in the year, this, over and\r\nabove, pays all sorts of tribute, and affords revenues suitable to\r\nthe necessities of the government. Nor do they, like you, esteem such\r\ninjunctions a disgrace to them, although they have but one Roman legion\r\nthat abides among them. And indeed what occasion is there for showing\r\nyou the power of the Romans over remote countries, when it is so easy to\r\nlearn it from Egypt, in your neighborhood? This country is extended as\r\nfar as the Ethiopians, and Arabia the Happy, and borders upon India; it\r\nhath seven millions five hundred thousand men, besides the inhabitants\r\nof Alexandria, as may be learned from the revenue of the poll tax; yet\r\nit is not ashamed to submit to the Roman government, although it hath\r\nAlexandria as a grand temptation to a revolt, by reason it is so full of\r\npeople and of riches, and is besides exceeding large, its length being\r\nthirty furlongs, and its breadth no less than ten; and it pays more\r\ntribute to the Romans in one month than you do in a year; nay, besides\r\nwhat it pays in money, it sends corn to Rome that supports it for four\r\nmonths [in the year]: it is also walled round on all sides, either by\r\nalmost impassable deserts, or seas that have no havens, or by rivers,\r\nor by lakes; yet have none of these things been found too strong for\r\nthe Roman good fortune; however, two legions that lie in that city are a\r\nbridle both for the remoter parts of Egypt, and for the parts inhabited\r\nby the more noble Macedonians. Where then are those people whom you are\r\nto have for your auxiliaries? Must they come from the parts of the world\r\nthat are uninhabited? for all that are in the habitable earth are [under\r\nthe] Romans. Unless any of you extend his hopes as far as beyond the\r\nEuphrates, and suppose that those of your own nation that dwell in\r\nAdiabene will come to your assistance; but certainly these will not\r\nembarrass themselves with an unjustifiable war, nor, if they should\r\nfollow such ill advice, will the Parthians permit them so to do; for\r\nit is their concern to maintain the truce that is between them and the\r\nRomans, and they will be supposed to break the covenants between them,\r\nif any under their government march against the Romans. What remains,\r\ntherefore, is this, that you have recourse to Divine assistance; but\r\nthis is already on the side of the Romans; for it is impossible that so\r\nvast an empire should be settled without God's providence. Reflect upon\r\nit, how impossible it is for your zealous observations of your religious\r\ncustoms to be here preserved, which are hard to be observed even when\r\nyou fight with those whom you are able to conquer; and how can you\r\nthen most of all hope for God's assistance, when, by being forced to\r\ntransgress his law, you will make him turn his face from you? and if you\r\ndo observe the custom of the sabbath days, and will not be revealed\r\non to do any thing thereon, you will easily be taken, as were your\r\nforefathers by Pompey, who was the busiest in his siege on those days on\r\nwhich the besieged rested. But if in time of war you transgress the law\r\nof your country, I cannot tell on whose account you will afterward go\r\nto war; for your concern is but one, that you do nothing against any of\r\nyour forefathers; and how will you call upon God to assist you, when you\r\nare voluntarily transgressing against his religion? Now all men that go\r\nto war do it either as depending on Divine or on human assistance; but\r\nsince your going to war will cut off both those assistances, those that\r\nare for going to war choose evident destruction. What hinders you from\r\nslaying your children and wives with your own hands, and burning this\r\nmost excellent native city of yours? for by this mad prank you will,\r\nhowever, escape the reproach of being beaten. But it were best, O\r\nmy friends, it were best, while the vessel is still in the haven, to\r\nforesee the impending storm, and not to set sail out of the port into\r\nthe middle of the hurricanes; for we justly pity those who fall into\r\ngreat misfortunes without fore-seeing them; but for him who rushes\r\ninto manifest ruin, he gains reproaches [instead of commiseration].\r\nBut certainly no one can imagine that you can enter into a war as by\r\nagreement, or that when the Romans have got you under their power, they\r\nwill use you with moderation, or will not rather, for an example to\r\nother nations, burn your holy city, and utterly destroy your whole\r\nnation; for those of you who shall survive the war will not be able to\r\nfind a place whither to flee, since all men have the Romans for their\r\nlords already, or are afraid they shall have hereafter. Nay, indeed, the\r\ndanger concerns not those Jews that dwell here only, but those of\r\nthem which dwell in other cities also; for there is no people upon the\r\nhabitable earth which have not some portion of you among them, whom your\r\nenemies will slay, in case you go to war, and on that account also; and\r\nso every city which hath Jews in it will be filled with slaughter for\r\nthe sake of a few men, and they who slay them will be pardoned; but if\r\nthat slaughter be not made by them, consider how wicked a thing it is to\r\ntake arms against those that are so kind to you. Have pity, therefore,\r\nif not on your children and wives, yet upon this your metropolis, and\r\nits sacred walls; spare the temple, and preserve the holy house, with\r\nits holy furniture, for yourselves; for if the Romans get you under\r\ntheir power, they will no longer abstain from them, when their former\r\nabstinence shall have been so ungratefully requited. I call to witness\r\nyour sanctuary, and the holy angels of God, and this country common\r\nto us all, that I have not kept back any thing that is for your\r\npreservation; and if you will follow that advice which you ought to do,\r\nyou will have that peace which will be common to you and to me; but if\r\nyou indulge four passions, you will run those hazards which I shall be\r\nfree from.\"\r\n\r\n5. When Agrippa had spoken thus, both he and his sister wept, and by\r\ntheir tears repressed a great deal of the violence of the people; but\r\nstill they cried out, that they would not fight against the Romans, but\r\nagainst Florus, on account of what they had suffered by his means. To\r\nwhich Agrippa replied, that what they had already done was like such as\r\nmake war against the Romans; \"for you have not paid the tribute which is\r\ndue to Caesar 25 and you have cut off the cloisters [of the temple] from\r\njoining to the tower Antonia. You will therefore prevent any occasion\r\nof revolt if you will but join these together again, and if you will but\r\npay your tribute; for the citadel does not now belong to Florus, nor are\r\nyou to pay the tribute money to Florus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The War Of The Jews With The Romans Began, And\r\n     Concerning Manahem.\r\n\r\n1. This advice the people hearkened to, and went up into the temple with\r\nthe king and Bernice, and began to rebuild the cloisters; the rulers\r\nalso and senators divided themselves into the villages, and collected\r\nthe tributes, and soon got together forty talents, which was the sum\r\nthat was deficient. And thus did Agrippa then put a stop to that war\r\nwhich was threatened. Moreover, he attempted to persuade the multitude\r\nto obey Florus, until Caesar should send one to succeed him; but they\r\nwere hereby more provoked, and cast reproaches upon the king, and\r\ngot him excluded out of the city; nay, some of the seditious had the\r\nimpudence to throw stones at him. So when the king saw that the violence\r\nof those that were for innovations was not to be restrained, and being\r\nvery angry at the contumelies he had received, he sent their rulers,\r\ntogether with their men of power, to Florus, to Cesarea, that he might\r\nappoint whom he thought fit to collect the tribute in the country, while\r\nhe retired into his own kingdom.\r\n\r\n2. And at this time it was that some of those that principally excited\r\nthe people to go to war made an assault upon a certain fortress called\r\nMasada. They took it by treachery, and slew the Romans that were there,\r\nand put others of their own party to keep it. At the same time Eleazar,\r\nthe son of Ananias the high priest, a very bold youth, who was at that\r\ntime governor of the temple, persuaded those that officiated in the\r\nDivine service to receive no gift or sacrifice for any foreigner.\r\nAnd this was the true beginning of our war with the Romans; for they\r\nrejected the sacrifice of Caesar on this account; and when many of the\r\nhigh priests and principal men besought them not to omit the sacrifice,\r\nwhich it was customary for them to offer for their princes, they would\r\nnot be prevailed upon. These relied much upon their multitude, for the\r\nmost flourishing part of the innovators assisted them; but they had the\r\nchief regard to Eleazar, the governor of the temple.\r\n\r\n3. Hereupon the men of power got together, and conferred with the high\r\npriests, as did also the principal of the Pharisees; and thinking all\r\nwas at stake, and that their calamities were becoming incurable, took\r\ncounsel what was to be done. Accordingly, they determined to try what\r\nthey could do with the seditious by words, and assembled the people\r\nbefore the brazen gate, which was that gate of the inner temple [court\r\nof the priests] which looked toward the sun-rising. And, in the first\r\nplace, they showed the great indignation they had at this attempt for a\r\nrevolt, and for their bringing so great a war upon their country; after\r\nwhich they confuted their pretense as unjustifiable, and told them that\r\ntheir forefathers had adorned their temple in great part with donations\r\nbestowed on them by foreigners, and had always received what had been\r\npresented to them from foreign nations; and that they had been so\r\nfar from rejecting any person's sacrifice [which would be the highest\r\ninstance of impiety,] that they had themselves placed those donation\r\nabout the temple which were still visible, and had remained there so\r\nlong a time; that they did now irritate the Romans to take arms against\r\nthem, and invited them to make war upon them, and brought up novel rules\r\nof a strange Divine worship, and determined to run the hazard of\r\nhaving their city condemned for impiety, while they would not allow any\r\nforeigner, but Jews only, either to sacrifice or to worship therein.\r\nAnd if such a law should be introduced in the case of a single private\r\nperson only, he would have indignation at it, as an instance of\r\ninhumanity determined against him; while they have no regard to the\r\nRomans or to Caesar, and forbid even their oblations to be received\r\nalso; that however they cannot but fear, lest, by thus rejecting their\r\nsacrifices, they shall not be allowed to offer their own; and that this\r\ncity will lose its principality, unless they grow wiser quickly, and\r\nrestore the sacrifices as formerly, and indeed amend the injury [they\r\nhave offered foreigners] before the report of it comes to the ears of\r\nthose that have been injured.\r\n\r\n4. And as they said these things, they produced those priests that were\r\nskillful in the customs of their country, who made the report that all\r\ntheir forefathers had received the sacrifices from foreign nations. But\r\nstill not one of the innovators would hearken to what was said; nay,\r\nthose that ministered about the temple would not attend their Divine\r\nservice, but were preparing matters for beginning the war. So the men of\r\npower perceiving that the sedition was too hard for them to subdue, and\r\nthat the danger which would arise from the Romans would come upon them\r\nfirst of all, endeavored to save themselves, and sent ambassadors, some\r\nto Florus, the chief of which was Simon the son of Ananias; and others\r\nto Agrippa, among whom the most eminent were Saul, and Antipas, and\r\nCostobarus, who were of the king's kindred; and they desired of them\r\nboth that they would come with an army to the city, and cut off the\r\nseditious before it should be too hard to be subdued. Now this terrible\r\nmessage was good news to Florus; and because his design was to have a\r\nwar kindled, he gave the ambassadors no answer at all. But Agrippa was\r\nequally solicitous for those that were revolting, and for those against\r\nwhom the war was to be made, and was desirous to preserve the Jews for\r\nthe Romans, and the temple and metropolis for the Jews; he was also\r\nsensible that it was not for his own advantage that the disturbances\r\nshould proceed; so he sent three thousand horsemen to the assistance\r\nof the people out of Auranitis, and Batanea, and Trachonitis, and these\r\nunder Darius, the master of his horse, and Philip the son of Jacimus,\r\nthe general of his army.\r\n\r\n5. Upon this the men of power, with the high priests, as also all the\r\npart of the multitude that were desirous of peace, took courage, and\r\nseized upon the upper city [Mount Sion;] for the seditious part had the\r\nlower city and the temple in their power; so they made use of stones and\r\nslings perpetually against one another, and threw darts continually\r\non both sides; and sometimes it happened that they made incursions\r\nby troops, and fought it out hand to hand, while the seditious were\r\nsuperior in boldness, but the king's soldiers in skill. These last\r\nstrove chiefly to gain the temple, and to drive those out of it who\r\nprofaned it; as did the seditious, with Eleazar, besides what they\r\nhad already, labor to gain the upper city. Thus were there perpetual\r\nslaughters on both sides for seven days' time; but neither side would\r\nyield up the parts they had seized on.\r\n\r\n6. Now the next day was the festival of Xylophory; upon which the custom\r\nwas for every one to bring wood for the altar [that there might never be\r\na want of fuel for that fire which was unquenchable and always burning].\r\nUpon that day they excluded the opposite party from the observation of\r\nthis part of religion. And when they had joined to themselves many of\r\nthe Sicarii, who crowded in among the weaker people, [that was the name\r\nfor such robbers as had under their bosoms swords called Sicae,] they\r\ngrew bolder, and carried their undertaking further; insomuch that the\r\nking's soldiers were overpowered by their multitude and boldness; and\r\nso they gave way, and were driven out of the upper city by force. The\r\nothers then set fire to the house of Ananias the high priest, and to the\r\npalaces of Agrippa and Bernice; after which they carried the fire to\r\nthe place where the archives were reposited, and made haste to burn the\r\ncontracts belonging to their creditors, and thereby to dissolve their\r\nobligations for paying their debts; and this was done in order to\r\ngain the multitude of those who had been debtors, and that they might\r\npersuade the poorer sort to join in their insurrection with safety\r\nagainst the more wealthy; so the keepers of the records fled away, and\r\nthe rest set fire to them. And when they had thus burnt down the nerves\r\nof the city, they fell upon their enemies; at which time some of the men\r\nof power, and of the high priests, went into the vaults under ground,\r\nand concealed themselves, while others fled with the king's soldiers\r\nto the upper palace, and shut the gates immediately; among whom were\r\nAnanias the high priest, and the ambassadors that had been sent to\r\nAgrippa. And now the seditious were contented with the victory they had\r\ngotten, and the buildings they had burnt down, and proceeded no further.\r\n\r\n7. But on the next day, which was the fifteenth of the month Lous, [Ab,]\r\nthey made an assault upon Antonia, and besieged the garrison which was\r\nin it two days, and then took the garrison, and slew them, and set the\r\ncitadel on fire; after which they marched to the palace, whither the\r\nking's soldiers were fled, and parted themselves into four bodies, and\r\nmade an attack upon the walls. As for those that were within it, no one\r\nhad the courage to sally out, because those that assaulted them were\r\nso numerous; but they distributed themselves into the breast-works and\r\nturrets, and shot at the besiegers, whereby many of the robbers fell\r\nunder the walls; nor did they cease to fight one with another either by\r\nnight or by day, while the seditious supposed that those within would\r\ngrow weary for want of food, and those without supposed the others would\r\ndo the like by the tediousness of the siege.\r\n\r\n8. In the mean time, one Manahem, the son of Judas, that was called the\r\nGalilean, [who was a very cunning sophister, and had formerly reproached\r\nthe Jews under Cyrenius, that after God they were subject to the\r\nRomans,] took some of the men of note with him, and retired to Masada,\r\nwhere he broke open king Herod's armory, and gave arms not only to his\r\nown people, but to other robbers also. These he made use of for a guard,\r\nand returned in the state of a king to Jerusalem; he became the leader\r\nof the sedition, and gave orders for continuing the siege; but they\r\nwanted proper instruments, and it was not practicable to undermine the\r\nwall, because the darts came down upon them from above. But still they\r\ndug a mine from a great distance under one of the towers, and made it\r\ntotter; and having done that, they set on fire what was combustible, and\r\nleft it; and when the foundations were burnt below, the tower fell down\r\nsuddenly. Yet did they then meet with another wall that had been built\r\nwithin, for the besieged were sensible beforehand of what they were\r\ndoing, and probably the tower shook as it was undermining; so they\r\nprovided themselves of another fortification; which when the besiegers\r\nunexpectedly saw, while they thought they had already gained the place,\r\nthey were under some consternation. However, those that were within sent\r\nto Manahem, and to the other leaders of the sedition, and desired\r\nthey might go out upon a capitulation: this was granted to the king's\r\nsoldiers and their own countrymen only, who went out accordingly; but\r\nthe Romans that were left alone were greatly dejected, for they were not\r\nable to force their way through such a multitude; and to desire them to\r\ngive them their right hand for their security, they thought it would be\r\na reproach to them; and besides, if they should give it them, they durst\r\nnot depend upon it; so they deserted their camp, as easily taken,\r\nand ran away to the royal towers,--that called Hippicus, that called\r\nPhasaelus, and that called Mariamne. But Manahem and his party fell upon\r\nthe place whence the soldiers were fled, and slew as many of them as\r\nthey could catch, before they got up to the towers, and plundered what\r\nthey left behind them, and set fire to their camp. This was executed on\r\nthe sixth day of the month Gorpieus [Elul].\r\n\r\n9. But on the next day the high priest was caught where he had concealed\r\nhimself in an aqueduct; he was slain, together with Hezekiah his\r\nbrother, by the robbers: hereupon the seditious besieged the towers, and\r\nkept them guarded, lest any one of the soldiers should escape. Now the\r\noverthrow of the places of strength, and the death of the high priest\r\nAnanias, so puffed up Manahem, that he became barbarously cruel; and\r\nas he thought he had no antagonist to dispute the management of affairs\r\nwith him, he was no better than an insupportable tyrant; but Eleazar\r\nand his party, when words had passed between them, how it was not proper\r\nwhen they revolted from the Romans, out of the desire of liberty, to\r\nbetray that liberty to any of their own people, and to bear a lord,\r\nwho, though he should be guilty of no violence, was yet meaner than\r\nthemselves; as also, that in case they were obliged to set some one over\r\ntheir public affairs, it was fitter they should give that privilege to\r\nany one rather than to him; they made an assault upon him in the temple;\r\nfor he went up thither to worship in a pompous manner, and adorned\r\nwith royal garments, and had his followers with him in their armor. But\r\nEleazar and his party fell violently upon him, as did also the rest of\r\nthe people; and taking up stones to attack him withal, they threw them\r\nat the sophister, and thought, that if he were once ruined, the entire\r\nsedition would fall to the ground. Now Manahem and his party made\r\nresistance for a while; but when they perceived that the whole multitude\r\nwere falling upon them, they fled which way every one was able; those\r\nthat were caught were slain, and those that hid themselves were searched\r\nfor. A few there were of them who privately escaped to Masada, among\r\nwhom was Eleazar, the son of Jairus, who was of kin to Manahem, and\r\nacted the part of a tyrant at Masada afterward. As for Manahem himself,\r\nhe ran away to the place called Ophla, and there lay skulking in\r\nprivate; but they took him alive, and drew him out before them all; they\r\nthen tortured him with many sorts of torments, and after all slew him,\r\nas they did by those that were captains under him also, and particularly\r\nby the principal instrument of his tyranny, whose name was Apsalom.\r\n\r\n10. And, as I said, so far truly the people assisted them, while they\r\nhoped this might afford some amendment to the seditious practices; but\r\nthe others were not in haste to put an end to the war, but hoped to\r\nprosecute it with less danger, now they had slain Manahem. It is\r\ntrue, that when the people earnestly desired that they would leave\r\noff besieging the soldiers, they were the more earnest in pressing it\r\nforward, and this till Metilius, who was the Roman general, sent to\r\nEleazar, and desired that they would give them security to spare their\r\nlives only; but agreed to deliver up their arms, and what else they had\r\nwith them. The others readily complied with their petition, sent to them\r\nGorion, the son of Nicodemus, and Ananias, the son of Sadduk, and Judas,\r\nthe son of Jonathan, that they might give them the security Of their\r\nright hands, and of their oaths; after which Metilius brought down his\r\nsoldiers; which soldiers, while they were in arms, were not meddled with\r\nby any of the seditious, nor was there any appearance of treachery; but\r\nas soon as, according to the articles of capitulation, they had all laid\r\ndown their shields and their swords, and were under no further suspicion\r\nof any harm, but were going away, Eleazar's men attacked them after a\r\nviolent manner, and encompassed them round, and slew them, while they\r\nneither defended themselves, nor entreated for mercy, but only cried out\r\nupon the breach of their articles of capitulation and their oaths. And\r\nthus were all these men barbarously murdered, excepting Metilius; for\r\nwhen he entreated for mercy, and promised that he would turn Jew, and\r\nbe circumcised, they saved him alive, but none else. This loss to the\r\nRomans was but light, there being no more than a few slain out of an\r\nimmense army; but still it appeared to be a prelude to the Jews' own\r\ndestruction, while men made public lamentation when they saw that such\r\noccasions were afforded for a war as were incurable; that the city\r\nwas all over polluted with such abominations, from which it was but\r\nreasonable to expect some vengeance, even though they should escape\r\nrevenge from the Romans; so that the city was filled with sadness, and\r\nevery one of the moderate men in it were under great disturbance,\r\nas likely themselves to undergo punishment for the wickedness of the\r\nseditious; for indeed it so happened that this murder was perpetrated on\r\nthe sabbath day, on which day the Jews have a respite from their works\r\non account of Divine worship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Calamities And Slaughters That Came Upon The Jews.\r\n\r\n1. Now the people of Cesarea had slain the Jews that were among them\r\non the very same day and hour [when the soldiers were slain], which\r\none would think must have come to pass by the direction of Providence;\r\ninsomuch that in one hour's time above twenty thousand Jews were killed,\r\nand all Cesarea was emptied of its Jewish inhabitants; for Florus caught\r\nsuch as ran away, and sent them in bonds to the galleys. Upon which\r\nstroke that the Jews received at Cesarea, the whole nation was greatly\r\nenraged; so they divided themselves into several parties, and laid waste\r\nthe villages of the Syrians, and their neighboring cities, Philadelphia,\r\nand Sebonitis, and Gerasa, and Pella, and Scythopolis, and after them\r\nGadara, and Hippos; and falling upon Gaulonitis, some cities they\r\ndestroyed there, and some they set on fire, and then went to Kedasa,\r\nbelonging to the Tyrians, and to Ptolemais, and to Gaba, and to Cesarea;\r\nnor was either Sebaste [Samaria] or Askelon able to oppose the violence\r\nwith which they were attacked; and when they had burnt these to the\r\nground; they entirely demolished Anthedon and Gaza; many also of the\r\nvillages that were about every one of those cities were plundered, and\r\nan immense slaughter was made of the men who were caught in them.\r\n\r\n2. However, the Syrians were even with the Jews in the multitude of\r\nthe men whom they slew; for they killed those whom they caught in their\r\ncities, and that not only out of the hatred they bare them, as formerly,\r\nbut to prevent the danger under which they were from them; so that the\r\ndisorders in all Syria were terrible, and every city was divided into\r\ntwo armies, encamped one against another, and the preservation of the\r\none party was in the destruction of the other; so the day time was spent\r\nin shedding of blood, and the night in fear, which was of the two the\r\nmore terrible; for when the Syrians thought they had ruined the Jews,\r\nthey had the Judaizers in suspicion also; and as each side did not care\r\nto slay those whom they only suspected on the other, so did they\r\ngreatly fear them when they were mingled with the other, as if they were\r\ncertainly foreigners. Moreover, greediness of gain was a provocation to\r\nkill the opposite party, even to such as had of old appeared very mild\r\nand gentle towards them; for they without fear plundered the effects of\r\nthe slain, and carried off the spoils of those whom they slew to their\r\nown houses, as if they had been gained in a set battle; and he was\r\nesteemed a man of honor who got the greatest share, as having prevailed\r\nover the greatest number of his enemies. It was then common to see\r\ncities filled with dead bodies, still lying unburied, and those of old\r\nmen, mixed with infants, all dead, and scattered about together; women\r\nalso lay amongst them, without any covering for their nakedness: you\r\nmight then see the whole province full of inexpressible calamities,\r\nwhile the dread of still more barbarous practices which were threatened\r\nwas every where greater than what had been already perpetrated.\r\n\r\n3. And thus far the conflict had been between Jews and foreigners; but\r\nwhen they made excursions to Scythopolis, they found Jew that acted as\r\nenemies; for as they stood in battle-array with those of Scythopolis,\r\nand preferred their own safety before their relation to us, they fought\r\nagainst their own countrymen; nay, their alacrity was so very great,\r\nthat those of Scythopolis suspected them. These were afraid, therefore,\r\nlest they should make an assault upon the city in the night time, and,\r\nto their great misfortune, should thereby make an apology for themselves\r\nto their own people for their revolt from them. So they commanded them,\r\nthat in case they would confirm their agreement and demonstrate their\r\nfidelity to them, who were of a different nation, they should go out of\r\nthe city, with their families to a neighboring grove; and when they had\r\ndone as they were commanded, without suspecting any thing, the people of\r\nScythopolis lay still for the interval of two days, to tempt them to be\r\nsecure; but on the third night they watched their opportunity, and cut\r\nall their throats, some as they lay unguarded, and some as they lay\r\nasleep. The number that was slain was above thirteen thousand, and then\r\nthey plundered them of all that they had.\r\n\r\n4. It will deserve our relation what befell Simon; he was the son of\r\none Saul, a man of reputation among the Jews. This man was distinguished\r\nfrom the rest by the strength of his body, and the boldness of his\r\nconduct, although he abused them both to the mischieving of his\r\ncountrymen; for he came every day and slew a great many of the Jews of\r\nScythopolis, and he frequently put them to flight, and became himself\r\nalone the cause of his army's conquering. But a just punishment overtook\r\nhim for the murders he had committed upon those of the same nation with\r\nhim; for when the people of Scythopolis threw their darts at them in the\r\ngrove, he drew his sword, but did not attack any of the enemy; for he\r\nsaw that he could do nothing against such a multitude; but he cried out\r\nafter a very moving manner, and said, \"O you people of Scythopolis, I\r\ndeservedly suffer for what I have done with relation to you, when I gave\r\nyou such security of my fidelity to you, by slaying so many of those\r\nthat were related to me. Wherefore we very justly experience the\r\nperfidiousness of foreigners, while we acted after a most wicked manner\r\nagainst our own nation. I will therefore die, polluted wretch as I am,\r\nby mine own hands; for it is not fit I should die by the hand of our\r\nenemies; and let the same action be to me both a punishment for my great\r\ncrimes, and a testimony of my courage to my commendation, that so no one\r\nof our enemies may have it to brag of, that he it was that slew me,\r\nand no one may insult upon me as I fall.\" Now when he had said this, he\r\nlooked round about him upon his family with eyes of commiseration and\r\nof rage [that family consisted of a wife and children, and his aged\r\nparents]; so, in the first place, he caught his father by his grey\r\nhairs, and ran his sword through him, and after him he did the same to\r\nhis mother, who willingly received it; and after them he did the like\r\nto his wife and children, every one almost offering themselves to his\r\nsword, as desirous to prevent being slain by their enemies; so when he\r\nhad gone over all his family, he stood upon their bodies to be seen\r\nby all, and stretching out his right hand, that his action might be\r\nobserved by all, he sheathed his entire sword into his own bowels. This\r\nyoung man was to be pitied, on account of the strength of his body and\r\nthe courage of his soul; but since he had assured foreigners of his\r\nfidelity [against his own countrymen], he suffered deservedly.\r\n\r\n5. Besides this murder at Scythopolis, the other cities rose up against\r\nthe Jews that were among them; those of Askelon slew two thousand five\r\nhundred, and those of Ptolemais two thousand, and put not a few into\r\nbonds; those of Tyre also put a great number to death, but kept a\r\ngreater number in prison; moreover, those of Hippos, and those of\r\nGadara, did the like while they put to death the boldest of the Jews,\r\nbut kept those of whom they were afraid in custody; as did the rest of\r\nthe cities of Syria, according as they every one either hated them or\r\nwere afraid of them; only the Antiochtans the Sidontans, and Apamians\r\nspared those that dwelt with them, and would not endure either to kill\r\nany of the Jews, or to put them in bonds. And perhaps they spared them,\r\nbecause their own number was so great that they despised their\r\nattempts. But I think the greatest part of this favor was owing to their\r\ncommiseration of those whom they saw to make no innovations. As for the\r\nGerasans, they did no harm to those that abode with them; and for those\r\nwho had a mind to go away, they conducted them as far as their borders\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n6. There was also a plot laid against the Jews in Agrippa's kingdom; for\r\nhe was himself gone to Cestius Gallus, to Antioch, but had left one\r\nof his companions, whose name was Noarus, to take care of the public\r\naffairs; which Noarus was of kin to king Sohemus. 26 Now there came\r\ncertain men seventy in number, out of Batanea, who were the most\r\nconsiderable for their families and prudence of the rest of the people;\r\nthese desired to have an army put into their hands, that if any tumult\r\nshould happen, they might have about them a guard sufficient to restrain\r\nsuch as might rise up against them. This Noarus sent out some of the\r\nking's armed men by night, and slew all those [seventy] men; which bold\r\naction he ventured upon without the consent of Agrippa, and was such\r\na lover of money, that he chose to be so wicked to his own countrymen,\r\nthough he brought ruin on the kingdom thereby; and thus cruelly did he\r\ntreat that nation, and this contrary to the laws also, until Agrippa\r\nwas informed of it, who did not indeed dare to put him to death, out\r\nof regard to Sohemus; but still he put an end to his procuratorship\r\nimmediately. But as to the seditious, they took the citadel which\r\nwas called Cypros, and was above Jericho, and cut the throats of the\r\ngarrison, and utterly demolished the fortifications. This was about\r\nthe same time that the multitude of the Jews that were at Machaerus\r\npersuaded the Romans who were in garrison to leave the place, and\r\ndeliver it up to them. These Romans being in great fear, lest the place\r\nshould be taken by force, made an agreement with them to depart upon\r\ncertain conditions; and when they had obtained the security they\r\ndesired, they delivered up the citadel, into which the people of\r\nMachaerus put a garrison for their own security, and held it in their\r\nown power.\r\n\r\n7. But for Alexandria, the sedition of the people of the place against\r\nthe Jews was perpetual, and this from that very time when Alexander [the\r\nGreat], upon finding the readiness of the Jews in assisting him against\r\nthe Egyptians, and as a reward for such their assistance, gave them\r\nequal privileges in this city with the Grecians themselves; which\r\nhonorary reward Continued among them under his successors, who also set\r\napart for them a particular place, that they might live without being\r\npolluted [by the Gentiles], and were thereby not so much intermixed with\r\nforeigners as before; they also gave them this further privilege, that\r\nthey should be called Macedonians. Nay, when the Romans got possession\r\nof Egypt, neither the first Caesar, nor any one that came after him,\r\nthought of diminishing the honors which Alexander had bestowed on the\r\nJews. But still conflicts perpetually arose with the Grecians; and\r\nalthough the governors did every day punish many of them, yet did\r\nthe sedition grow worse; but at this time especially, when there were\r\ntumults in other places also, the disorders among them were put into a\r\ngreater flame; for when the Alexandrians had once a public assembly, to\r\ndeliberate about an embassage they were sending to Nero, a great number\r\nof Jews came flocking to the theater; but when their adversaries saw\r\nthem, they immediately cried out, and called them their enemies, and\r\nsaid they came as spies upon them; upon which they rushed out, and laid\r\nviolent hands upon them; and as for the rest, they were slain as they\r\nran away; but there were three men whom they caught, and hauled them\r\nalong, in order to have them burnt alive; but all the Jews came in a\r\nbody to defend them, who at first threw stones at the Grecians, but\r\nafter that they took lamps, and rushed with violence into the theater,\r\nand threatened that they would burn the people to a man; and this they\r\nhad soon done, unless Tiberius Alexander, the governor of the city, had\r\nrestrained their passions. However, this man did not begin to teach them\r\nwisdom by arms, but sent among them privately some of the principal men,\r\nand thereby entreated them to be quiet, and not provoke the Roman\r\narmy against them; but the seditious made a jest of the entreaties of\r\nTiberius, and reproached him for so doing.\r\n\r\n8. Now when he perceived that those who were for innovations would not\r\nbe pacified till some great calamity should overtake them, he sent out\r\nupon them those two Roman legions that were in the city, and together\r\nwith them five thousand other soldiers, who, by chance, were come\r\ntogether out of Libya, to the ruin of the Jews. They were also permitted\r\nnot only to kill them, but to plunder them of what they had, and to set\r\nfire to their houses. These soldiers rushed violently into that part of\r\nthe city that was called Delta, where the Jewish people lived together,\r\nand did as they were bidden, though not without bloodshed on their own\r\nside also; for the Jews got together, and set those that were the best\r\narmed among them in the forefront, and made a resistance for a great\r\nwhile; but when once they gave back, they were destroyed unmercifully;\r\nand this their destruction was complete, some being caught in the open\r\nfield, and others forced into their houses, which houses were first\r\nplundered of what was in them, and then set on fire by the Romans;\r\nwherein no mercy was shown to the infants, and no regard had to the\r\naged; but they went on in the slaughter of persons of every age, till\r\nall the place was overflowed with blood, and fifty thousand of them\r\nlay dead upon heaps; nor had the remainder been preserved, had they not\r\nbe-taken themselves to supplication. So Alexander commiserated their\r\ncondition, and gave orders to the Romans to retire; accordingly,\r\nthese being accustomed to obey orders, left off killing at the first\r\nintimation; but the populace of Alexandria bare so very great hatred to\r\nthe Jews, that it was difficult to recall them, and it was a hard thing\r\nto make them leave their dead bodies.\r\n\r\n9. And this was the miserable calamity which at this time befell the\r\nJews at Alexandria. Hereupon Cestius thought fit no longer to lie still,\r\nwhile the Jews were everywhere up in arms; so he took out of Antioch\r\nthe twelfth legion entire, and out of each of the rest he selected two\r\nthousand, with six cohorts of footmen, and four troops of horsemen,\r\nbesides those auxiliaries which were sent by the kings; of which\r\nAntiochus sent two thousand horsemen, and three thousand footmen, with\r\nas many archers; and Agrippa sent the same number of footmen, and one\r\nthousand horsemen; Sohemus also followed with four thousand, a third\r\npart whereof were horsemen, but most part were archers, and thus did\r\nhe march to Ptolemais. There were also great numbers of auxiliaries\r\ngathered together from the [free] cities, who indeed had not the same\r\nskill in martial affairs, but made up in their alacrity and in their\r\nhatred to the Jews what they wanted in skill. There came also along with\r\nCestius Agrippa himself, both as a guide in his march over the country,\r\nand a director what was fit to be done; so Cestius took part of his\r\nforces, and marched hastily to Zabulon, a strong city of Galilee, which\r\nwas called the City of Men, and divides the country of Ptolemais from\r\nour nation; this he found deserted by its men, the multitude having fled\r\nto the mountains, but full of all sorts of good things; those he gave\r\nleave to the soldiers to plunder, and set fire to the city, although it\r\nwas of admirable beauty, and had its houses built like those in Tyre,\r\nand Sidon, and Berytus. After this he overran all the country, and\r\nseized upon whatsoever came in his way, and set fire to the villages\r\nthat were round about them, and then returned to Ptolemais. But when the\r\nSyrians, and especially those of Berytus, were busy in plundering,\r\nthe Jews pulled up their courage again, for they knew that Cestius was\r\nretired, and fell upon those that were left behind unexpectedly, and\r\ndestroyed about two thousand of them. 27\r\n\r\n10. And now Cestius himself marched from Ptolemais, and came to Cesarea;\r\nbut he sent part of his army before him to Joppa, and gave order, that\r\nif they could take that city [by surprise] they should keep it; but that\r\nin case the citizens should perceive they were coming to attack them,\r\nthat they then should stay for him, and for the rest of the army. So\r\nsome of them made a brisk march by the sea-side, and some by land, and\r\nso coming upon them on both sides, they took the city with ease; and as\r\nthe inhabitants had made no provision beforehand for a flight, nor had\r\ngotten any thing ready for fighting, the soldiers fell upon them, and\r\nslew them all, with their families, and then plundered and burnt the\r\ncity. The number of the slain was eight thousand four hundred. In\r\nlike manner, Cestius sent also a considerable body of horsemen to the\r\ntoparchy of Narbatene, that adjoined to Cesarea, who destroyed the\r\ncountry, and slew a great multitude of its people; they also plundered\r\nwhat they had, and burnt their villages.\r\n\r\n11. But Cestius sent Gallus, the commander of the twelfth legion, into\r\nGalilee, and delivered to him as many of his forces as he supposed\r\nsufficient to subdue that nation. He was received by the strongest city\r\nof Galilee, which was Sepphoris, with acclamations of joy; which wise\r\nconduct of that city occasioned the rest of the cities to be in quiet;\r\nwhile the seditious part and the robbers ran away to that mountain\r\nwhich lies in the very middle of Galilee, and is situated over against\r\nSepphoris; it is called Asamon. So Gallus brought his forces against\r\nthem; but while those men were in the superior parts above the Romans,\r\nthey easily threw their darts upon the Romans, as they made their\r\napproaches, and slew about two hundred of them. But when the Romans had\r\ngone round the mountains, and were gotten into the parts above their\r\nenemies, the others were soon beaten; nor could they who had only light\r\narmor on sustain the force of them that fought them armed all over; nor\r\nwhen they were beaten could they escape the enemies' horsemen; insomuch\r\nthat only some few concealed themselves in certain places hard to be\r\ncome at, among the mountains, while the rest, above two thousand in\r\nnumber, were slain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n     What Cestius Did Against The Jews; And How, Upon His\r\n     Besieging Jerusalem, He Retreated From The City Without Any\r\n     Just Occasion In The World. As Also What Severe Calamities\r\n     He Under Went From The Jews In His Retreat.\r\n\r\n1. And now Gallus, seeing nothing more that looked towards an innovation\r\nin Galilee, returned with his army to Cesarea: but Cestius removed with\r\nhis whole army, and marched to Antipatris; and when he was informed that\r\nthere was a great body of Jewish forces gotten together in a certain\r\ntower called Aphek, he sent a party before to fight them; but this party\r\ndispersed the Jews by affrighting them before it came to a battle: so\r\nthey came, and finding their camp deserted, they burnt it, as well\r\nas the villages that lay about it. But when Cestius had marched from\r\nAntipatris to Lydda, he found the city empty of its men, for the whole\r\nmultitude 28 were gone up to Jerusalem to the feast of tabernacles;\r\nyet did he destroy fifty of those that showed themselves, and burnt the\r\ncity, and so marched forwards; and ascending by Betboron, he pitched\r\nhis camp at a certain place called Gabao, fifty furlongs distant from\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n2. But as for the Jews, when they saw the war approaching to their\r\nmetropolis, they left the feast, and betook themselves to their arms;\r\nand taking courage greatly from their multitude, went in a sudden and\r\ndisorderly manner to the fight, with a great noise, and without any\r\nconsideration had of the rest of the seventh day, although the Sabbath\r\n29 was the day to which they had the greatest regard; but that rage\r\nwhich made them forget the religious observation [of the sabbath]\r\nmade them too hard for their enemies in the fight: with such violence\r\ntherefore did they fall upon the Romans, as to break into their ranks,\r\nand to march through the midst of them, making a great slaughter as they\r\nwent, insomuch that unless the horsemen, and such part of the footmen as\r\nwere not yet tired in the action, had wheeled round, and succored that\r\npart of the army which was not yet broken, Cestius, with his whole army,\r\nhad been in danger: however, five hundred and fifteen of the Romans were\r\nslain, of which number four hundred were footmen, and the rest horsemen,\r\nwhile the Jews lost only twenty-two, of whom the most valiant were the\r\nkinsmen of Monobazus, king of Adiabene, and their names were Monobazus\r\nand Kenedeus; and next to them were Niger of Perea, and Silas of\r\nBabylon, who had deserted from king Agrippa to the Jews; for he had\r\nformerly served in his army. When the front of the Jewish army had been\r\ncut off, the Jews retired into the city; but still Simon, the son of\r\nGiora, fell upon the backs of the Romans, as they were ascending up\r\nBethoron, and put the hindmost of the army into disorder, and carried\r\noff many of the beasts that carried the weapons of war, and led Shem\r\ninto the city. But as Cestius tarried there three days, the Jews seized\r\nupon the elevated parts of the city, and set watches at the entrances\r\ninto the city, and appeared openly resolved not to rest when once the\r\nRomans should begin to march.\r\n\r\n3. And now when Agrippa observed that even the affairs of the Romans\r\nwere likely to be in danger, while such an immense multitude of their\r\nenemies had seized upon the mountains round about, he determined to try\r\nwhat the Jews would agree to by words, as thinking that he should either\r\npersuade them all to desist from fighting, or, however, that he should\r\ncause the sober part of them to separate themselves from the opposite\r\nparty. So he sent Borceus and Phebus, the persons of his party that were\r\nthe best known to them, and promised them that Cestius should give them\r\nhis right hand, to secure them of the Romans' entire forgiveness of what\r\nthey had done amiss, if they would throw away their arms, and come over\r\nto them; but the seditious, fearing lest the whole multitude, in\r\nhopes of security to themselves, should go over to Agrippa, resolved\r\nimmediately to fall upon and kill the ambassadors; accordingly they\r\nslew Phebus before he said a word, but Borceus was only wounded, and so\r\nprevented his fate by flying away. And when the people were very angry\r\nat this, they had the seditious beaten with stones and clubs, and drove\r\nthem before them into the city.\r\n\r\n4. But now Cestius, observing that the disturbances that were begun\r\namong the Jews afforded him a proper opportunity to attack them, took\r\nhis whole army along with him, and put the Jews to flight, and pursued\r\nthem to Jerusalem. He then pitched his camp upon the elevation called\r\nScopus, [or watch-tower,] which was distant seven furlongs from\r\nthe city; yet did not he assault them in three days' time, out of\r\nexpectation that those within might perhaps yield a little; and in the\r\nmean time he sent out a great many of his soldiers into neighboring\r\nvillages, to seize upon their corn. And on the fourth day, which was the\r\nthirtieth of the month Hyperbereteus, [Tisri,] when he had put his army\r\nin array, he brought it into the city. Now for the people, they were\r\nkept under by the seditious; but the seditious themselves were greatly\r\naffrighted at the good order of the Romans, and retired from the\r\nsuburbs, and retreated into the inner part of the city, and into the\r\ntemple. But when Cestius was come into the city, he set the part called\r\nBezetha, which is called Cenopolis, [or the new city,] on fire; as he\r\ndid also to the timber market; after which he came into the upper city,\r\nand pitched his camp over against the royal palace; and had he but at\r\nthis very time attempted to get within the walls by force, he had won\r\nthe city presently, and the war had been put an end to at once; but\r\nTyrannius Priseus, the muster-master of the army, and a great number of\r\nthe officers of the horse, had been corrupted by Florus, and diverted\r\nhim from that his attempt; and that was the occasion that this war\r\nlasted so very long, and thereby the Jews were involved in such\r\nincurable calamities.\r\n\r\n5. In the mean time, many of the principal men of the city were\r\npersuaded by Ananus, the son of Jonathan, and invited Cestius into the\r\ncity, and were about to open the gates for him; but he overlooked this\r\noffer, partly out of his anger at the Jews, and partly because he did\r\nnot thoroughly believe they were in earnest; whence it was that he\r\ndelayed the matter so long, that the seditious perceived the treachery,\r\nand threw Ananus and those of his party down from the wall, and,\r\npelting them with stones, drove them into their houses; but they stood\r\nthemselves at proper distances in the towers, and threw their darts at\r\nthose that were getting over the wall. Thus did the Romans make their\r\nattack against the wall for five days, but to no purpose. But on the\r\nnext day Cestius took a great many of his choicest men, and with them\r\nthe archers, and attempted to break into the temple at the northern\r\nquarter of it; but the Jews beat them off from the cloisters, and\r\nrepulsed them several times when they were gotten near to the wall, till\r\nat length the multitude of the darts cut them off, and made them retire;\r\nbut the first rank of the Romans rested their shields upon the wall,\r\nand so did those that were behind them, and the like did those that were\r\nstill more backward, and guarded themselves with what they call Testudo,\r\n[the back of] a tortoise, upon which the darts that were thrown fell,\r\nand slided off without doing them any harm; so the soldiers undermined\r\nthe wall, without being themselves hurt, and got all things ready for\r\nsetting fire to the gate of the temple.\r\n\r\n6. And now it was that a horrible fear seized upon the seditious,\r\ninsomuch that many of them ran out of the city, as though it were to be\r\ntaken immediately; but the people upon this took courage, and where the\r\nwicked part of the city gave ground, thither did they come, in order to\r\nset open the gates, and to admit Cestius 30 as their benefactor, who,\r\nhad he but continued the siege a little longer, had certainly taken the\r\ncity; but it was, I suppose, owing to the aversion God had already at\r\nthe city and the sanctuary, that he was hindered from putting an end to\r\nthe war that very day.\r\n\r\n7. It then happened that Cestius was not conscious either how the\r\nbesieged despaired of success, nor how courageous the people were for\r\nhim; and so he recalled his soldiers from the place, and by despairing\r\nof any expectation of taking it, without having received any disgrace,\r\nhe retired from the city, without any reason in the world. But when the\r\nrobbers perceived this unexpected retreat of his, they resumed their\r\ncourage, and ran after the hinder parts of his army, and destroyed a\r\nconsiderable number of both their horsemen and footmen; and now Cestius\r\nlay all night at the camp which was at Scopus; and as he went off\r\nfarther next day, he thereby invited the enemy to follow him, who still\r\nfell upon the hindmost, and destroyed them; they also fell upon the\r\nflank on each side of the army, and threw darts upon them obliquely,\r\nnor durst those that were hindmost turn back upon those who wounded them\r\nbehind, as imagining that the multitude of those that pursued them was\r\nimmense; nor did they venture to drive away those that pressed upon them\r\non each side, because they were heavy with their arms, and were afraid\r\nof breaking their ranks to pieces, and because they saw the Jews were\r\nlight, and ready for making incursions upon them. And this was the\r\nreason why the Romans suffered greatly, without being able to revenge\r\nthemselves upon their enemies; so they were galled all the way, and\r\ntheir ranks were put into disorder, and those that were thus put out of\r\ntheir ranks were slain; among whom were Priscus, the commander of the\r\nsixth legion, and Longinus, the tribune, and Emilius Secundus, the\r\ncommander of a troop of horsemen. So it was not without difficulty that\r\nthey got to Gabao, their former camp, and that not without the loss of\r\na great part of their baggage. There it was that Cestius staid two\r\ndays, and was in great distress to know what he should do in these\r\ncircumstances; but when on the third day he saw a still much greater\r\nnumber of enemies, and all the parts round about him full of Jews, he\r\nunderstood that his delay was to his own detriment, and that if he staid\r\nany longer there, he should have still more enemies upon him.\r\n\r\n8. That therefore he might fly the faster, he gave orders to cast away\r\nwhat might hinder his army's march; so they killed the mules and other\r\ncreatures, excepting those that carried their darts and machines, which\r\nthey retained for their own use, and this principally because they were\r\nafraid lest the Jews should seize upon them. He then made his army march\r\non as far as Bethoron. Now the Jews did not so much press upon them when\r\nthey were in large open places; but when they were penned up in their\r\ndescent through narrow passages, then did some of them get before, and\r\nhindered them from getting out of them; and others of them thrust the\r\nhinder-most down into the lower places; and the whole multitude extended\r\nthemselves over against the neck of the passage, and covered the Roman\r\narmy with their darts. In which circumstances, as the footmen knew not\r\nhow to defend themselves, so the danger pressed the horsemen still more,\r\nfor they were so pelted, that they could not march along the road in\r\ntheir ranks, and the ascents were so high, that the cavalry were not\r\nable to march against the enemy; the precipices also and valleys into\r\nwhich they frequently fell, and tumbled down, were such on each side of\r\nthem, that there was neither place for their flight, nor any contrivance\r\ncould be thought of for their defense; till the distress they were at\r\nlast in was so great, that they betook themselves to lamentations, and\r\nto such mournful cries as men use in the utmost despair: the joyful\r\nacclamations of the Jews also, as they encouraged one another, echoed\r\nthe sounds back again, these last composing a noise of those that at\r\nonce rejoiced and were in a rage. Indeed, things were come to such a\r\npass, that the Jews had almost taken Cestius's entire army prisoners,\r\nhad not the night come on, when the Romans fled to Bethoron, and the\r\nJews seized upon all the places round about them, and watched for their\r\ncoming out [in the morning].\r\n\r\n9. And then it was that Cestius, despairing of obtaining room for a\r\npublic march, contrived how he might best run away; and when he had\r\nselected four hundred of the most courageous of his soldiers, he placed\r\nthem at the strongest of their fortifications, and gave order, that when\r\nthey went up to the morning guard, they should erect their ensigns, that\r\nthe Jews might be made to believe that the entire army was there still,\r\nwhile he himself took the rest of his forces with him, and marched,\r\nwithout any noise, thirty furlongs. But when the Jews perceived, in the\r\nmorning, that the camp was empty, they ran upon those four hundred who\r\nhad deluded them, and immediately threw their darts at them, and slew\r\nthem; and then pursued after Cestius. But he had already made use of a\r\ngreat part of the night in his flight, and still marched quicker when it\r\nwas day; insomuch that the soldiers, through the astonishment and\r\nfear they were in, left behind them their engines for sieges, and for\r\nthrowing of stones, and a great part of the instruments of war. So the\r\nJews went on pursuing the Romans as far as Antipatris; after which,\r\nseeing they could not overtake them, they came back, and took the\r\nengines, and spoiled the dead bodies, and gathered the prey together\r\nwhich the Romans had left behind them, and came back running and singing\r\nto their metropolis; while they had themselves lost a few only, but had\r\nslain of the Romans five thousand and three hundred footmen, and three\r\nhundred and eighty horsemen. This defeat happened on the eighth day of\r\nthe month Dius, [Marchesvan,] in the twelfth year of the reign of Nero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Cestius Sends Ambassadors To Nero. The People Of Damascus\r\n     Slay Those Jews That Lived With Them. The People Of\r\n     Jerusalem After They Had [Left Off] Pursuing Cestius, Return\r\n     To The City And Get Things Ready For Its Defense And Make A\r\n     Great Many Generals For Their Armies And Particularly\r\n     Josephus The Writer Of These Books. Some Account Of His\r\n     Administration.\r\n\r\n1. After this calamity had befallen Cestius, many of the most eminent\r\nof the Jews swam away from the city, as from a ship when it was going to\r\nsink; Costobarus, therefore, and Saul, who were brethren, together with\r\nPhilip, the son of Jacimus, who was the commander of king Agrippa's\r\nforces, ran away from the city, and went to Cestius. But then how\r\nAntipas, who had been besieged with them in the king's palace, but would\r\nnot fly away with them, was afterward slain by the seditious, we shall\r\nrelate hereafter. However, Cestius sent Saul and his friends, at their\r\nown desire, to Achaia, to Nero, to inform him of the great distress they\r\nwere in, and to lay the blame of their kindling the war upon Florus, as\r\nhoping to alleviate his own danger, by provoking his indignation against\r\nFlorus.\r\n\r\n2. In the mean time, the people of Damascus, when they were informed\r\nof the destruction of the Romans, set about the slaughter of those Jews\r\nthat were among them; and as they had them already cooped up together in\r\nthe place of public exercises, which they had done out of the suspicion\r\nthey had of them, they thought they should meet with no difficulty in\r\nthe attempt; yet did they distrust their own wives, which were almost\r\nall of them addicted to the Jewish religion; on which account it was\r\nthat their greatest concern was, how they might conceal these things\r\nfrom them; so they came upon the Jews, and cut their throats, as being\r\nin a narrow place, in number ten thousand, and all of them unarmed, and\r\nthis in one hour's time, without any body to disturb them.\r\n\r\n3. But as to those who had pursued after Cestius, when they were\r\nreturned back to Jerusalem, they overbore some of those that favored\r\nthe Romans by violence, and some them persuaded [by en-treaties] to\r\njoin with them, and got together in great numbers in the temple, and\r\nappointed a great many generals for the war. Joseph also, the son of\r\nGorion, 31 and Ananus the high priest, were chosen as governors of all\r\naffairs within the city, and with a particular charge to repair the\r\nwalls of the city; for they did not ordain Eleazar the son of Simon to\r\nthat office, although he had gotten into his possession the prey they\r\nhad taken from the Romans, and the money they had taken from Cestius,\r\ntogether with a great part of the public treasures, because they saw\r\nhe was of a tyrannical temper, and that his followers were, in their\r\nbehavior, like guards about him. However, the want they were in of\r\nEleazar's money, and the subtle tricks used by him, brought all so\r\nabout, that the people were circumvented, and submitted themselves to\r\nhis authority in all public affairs.\r\n\r\n4. They also chose other generals for Idumea; Jesus, the son of\r\nSapphias, one of the high priests; and Eleazar, the son of Ananias, the\r\nhigh priest; they also enjoined Niger, the then governor of Idumea,\r\n32 who was of a family that belonged to Perea, beyond Jordan, and\r\nwas thence called the Peraite, that he should be obedient to those\r\nfore-named commanders. Nor did they neglect the care of other parts of\r\nthe country; but Joseph the son of Simon was sent as general to Jericho,\r\nas was Manasseh to Perea, and John, the Esscue, to the toparchy of\r\nThamna; Lydda was also added to his portion, and Joppa, and Emmaus.\r\nBut John, the son of Matthias, was made governor of the toparchies of\r\nGophnitica and Acrabattene; as was Josephus, the son of Matthias, of\r\nboth the Galilees. Gamala also, which was the strongest city in those\r\nparts, was put under his command.\r\n\r\n5. So every one of the other commanders administered the affairs of his\r\nportion with that alacrity and prudence they were masters of; but as\r\nto Josephus, when he came into Galilee, his first care was to gain the\r\ngood-will of the people of that country, as sensible that he should\r\nthereby have in general good success, although he should fail in other\r\npoints. And being conscious to himself that if he communicated part of\r\nhis power to the great men, he should make them his fast friends; and\r\nthat he should gain the same favor from the multitude, if he executed\r\nhis commands by persons of their own country, and with whom they were\r\nwell acquainted; he chose out seventy of the most prudent men, and those\r\nelders in age, and appointed them to be rulers of all Galilee, as he\r\nchose seven judges in every city to hear the lesser quarrels; for as to\r\nthe greater causes, and those wherein life and death were concerned, he\r\nenjoined they should be brought to him and the seventy 33 elders.\r\n\r\n6. Josephus also, when he had settled these rules for determining causes\r\nby the law, with regard to the people's dealings one with another,\r\nbetook himself to make provisions for their safety against external\r\nviolence; and as he knew the Romans would fall upon Galilee, he built\r\nwalls in proper places about Jotapata, and Bersabee, and Selamis; and\r\nbesides these, about Caphareccho, and Japha, and Sigo, and what they\r\ncall Mount Tabor, and Taricheae, and Tiberias. Moreover, he built walls\r\nabout the caves near the lake of Gennesar, which places lay in the Lower\r\nGalilee; the same he did to the places of Upper Galilee, as well as to\r\nthe rock called the Rock of the Achabari, and to Seph, and Jamnith, and\r\nMeroth; and in Gaulonitis he fortified Seleucia, and Sogane, and Gamala;\r\nbut as to those of Sepphoris, they were the only people to whom he gave\r\nleave to build their own walls, and this because he perceived they were\r\nrich and wealthy, and ready to go to war, without standing in need of\r\nany injunctions for that purpose. The case was the same with Gischala,\r\nwhich had a wall built about it by John the son of Levi himself, but\r\nwith the consent of Josephus; but for the building of the rest of the\r\nfortresses, he labored together with all the other builders, and was\r\npresent to give all the necessary orders for that purpose. He also got\r\ntogether an army out of Galilee, of more than a hundred thousand young\r\nmen, all of which he armed with the old weapons which he had collected\r\ntogether and prepared for them.\r\n\r\n7. And when he had considered that the Roman power became invincible,\r\nchiefly by their readiness in obeying orders, and the constant exercise\r\nof their arms, he despaired of teaching these his men the use of their\r\narms, which was to be obtained by experience; but observing that\r\ntheir readiness in obeying orders was owing to the multitude of their\r\nofficers, he made his partitions in his army more after the Roman\r\nmanner, and appointed a great many subalterns. He also distributed the\r\nsoldiers into various classes, whom he put under captains of tens, and\r\ncaptains of hundreds, and then under captains of thousands; and besides\r\nthese, he had commanders of larger bodies of men. He also taught them to\r\ngive the signals one to another, and to call and recall the soldiers by\r\nthe trumpets, how to expand the wings of an army, and make them wheel\r\nabout; and when one wing hath had success, to turn again and assist\r\nthose that were hard set, and to join in the defense of what had most\r\nsuffered. He also continually instructed them in what concerned the\r\ncourage of the soul, and the hardiness of the body; and, above all, he\r\nexercised them for war, by declaring to them distinctly the good order\r\nof the Romans, and that they were to fight with men who, both by the\r\nstrength of their bodies and courage of their souls, had conquered in a\r\nmanner the whole habitable earth. He told them that he should make trial\r\nof the good order they would observe in war, even before it came to any\r\nbattle, in case they would abstain from the crimes they used to\r\nindulge themselves in, such as theft, and robbery, and rapine, and from\r\ndefrauding their own countrymen, and never to esteem the harm done\r\nto those that were so near of kin to them to be any advantage to\r\nthemselves; for that wars are then managed the best when the warriors\r\npreserve a good conscience; but that such as are ill men in private life\r\nwill not only have those for enemies which attack them, but God himself\r\nalso for their antagonist.\r\n\r\n8. And thus did he continue to admonish them. Now he chose for the war\r\nsuch an army as was sufficient, i.e. sixty thousand footmen, and two\r\nhundred and fifty horsemen; 34 and besides these, on which he put the\r\ngreatest trust, there were about four thousand five hundred mercenaries;\r\nhe had also six hundred men as guards of his body. Now the cities easily\r\nmaintained the rest of his army, excepting the mercenaries, for every\r\none of the cities enumerated above sent out half their men to the army,\r\nand retained the other half at home, in order to get provisions for\r\nthem; insomuch that the one part went to the war, and the other part to\r\ntheir work, and so those that sent out their corn were paid for it by\r\nthose that were in arms, by that security which they enjoyed from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning John Of Gichala. Josephus Uses Stratagems Against\r\n     The Plots John Laid Against Him And Recovers Certain Cities\r\n     Which Had Revolted From Him.\r\n\r\n1. Now as Josephus was thus engaged in the administration of the affairs\r\nof Galilee, there arose a treacherous person, a man of Gischala, the son\r\nof Levi, whose name was John. His character was that of a very cunning\r\nand very knavish person, beyond the ordinary rate of the other men\r\nof eminence there, and for wicked practices he had not his fellow\r\nany where. Poor he was at first, and for a long time his wants were a\r\nhinderance to him in his wicked designs. He was a ready liar, and yet\r\nvery sharp in gaining credit to his fictions: he thought it a point of\r\nvirtue to delude people, and would delude even such as were the dearest\r\nto him. He was a hypocritical pretender to humanity, but where he had\r\nhopes of gain, he spared not the shedding of blood: his desires were\r\never carried to great things, and he encouraged his hopes from those\r\nmean wicked tricks which he was the author of. He had a peculiar knack\r\nat thieving; but in some time he got certain companions in his impudent\r\npractices; at first they were but few, but as he proceeded on in his\r\nevil course, they became still more and more numerous. He took care that\r\nnone of his partners should be easily caught in their rogueries, but\r\nchose such out of the rest as had the strongest constitutions of body,\r\nand the greatest courage of soul, together with great skill in martial\r\naffairs; as he got together a band of four hundred men, who came\r\nprincipally out of the country of Tyre, and were vagabonds that had\r\nrun away from its villages; and by the means of these he laid waste\r\nall Galilee, and irritated a considerable number, who were in great\r\nexpectation of a war then suddenly to arise among them.\r\n\r\n2. However, John's want of money had hitherto restrained him in his\r\nambition after command, and in his attempts to advance himself. But when\r\nhe saw that Josephus was highly pleased with the activity of his temper,\r\nhe persuaded him, in the first place, to intrust him with the repairing\r\nof the walls of his native city, [Gischala,] in which work he got a\r\ngreat deal of money from the rich citizens. He after that contrived a\r\nvery shrewd trick, and pretending that the Jews who dwelt in Syria were\r\nobliged to make use of oil that was made by others than those of their\r\nown nation, he desired leave of Josephus to send oil to their borders;\r\nso he bought four amphorae with such Tyrian money as was of the value of\r\nfour Attic drachmae, and sold every half-amphora at the same price. And\r\nas Galilee was very fruitful in oil, and was peculiarly so at that time,\r\nby sending away great quantities, and having the sole privilege so\r\nto do, he gathered an immense sum of money together, which money he\r\nimmediately used to the disadvantage of him who gave him that privilege;\r\nand, as he supposed, that if he could once overthrow Josephus, he should\r\nhimself obtain the government of Galilee; so he gave orders to the\r\nrobbers that were under his command to be more zealous in their thievish\r\nexpeditions, that by the rise of many that desired innovations in the\r\ncountry, he might either catch their general in his snares, as he came\r\nto the country's assistance, and then kill him; or if he should overlook\r\nthe robbers, he might accuse him for his negligence to the people of the\r\ncountry. He also spread abroad a report far and near that Josephus was\r\ndelivering up the administration of affairs to the Romans; and many such\r\nplots did he lay, in order to ruin him.\r\n\r\n3. Now at the same time that certain young men of the village Dabaritta,\r\nwho kept guard in the Great Plain laid snares for Ptolemy, who was\r\nAgrippa's and Bernice's steward, and took from him all that he had with\r\nhim; among which things there were a great many costly garments, and no\r\nsmall number of silver cups, and six hundred pieces of gold; yet were\r\nthey not able to conceal what they had stolen, but brought it all to\r\nJosephus, to Taricheae. Hereupon he blamed them for the violence they\r\nhad offered to the king and queen, and deposited what they brought to\r\nhim with Eneas, the most potent man of Taricheae, with an intention of\r\nsending the things back to the owners at a proper time; which act of\r\nJosephus brought him into the greatest danger; for those that had stolen\r\nthe things had an indignation at him, both because they gained no share\r\nof it for themselves, and because they perceived beforehand what was\r\nJosephus's intention, and that he would freely deliver up what had cost\r\nthem so much pains to the king and queen. These ran away by night to\r\ntheir several villages, and declared to all men that Josephus was going\r\nto betray them: they also raised great disorders in all the neighboring\r\ncities, insomuch that in the morning a hundred thousand armed men came\r\nrunning together; which multitude was crowded together in the hippodrome\r\nat Taricheae, and made a very peevish clamor against him; while some\r\ncried out, that they should depose the traitor; and others, that they\r\nshould burn him. Now John irritated a great many, as did also one Jesus,\r\nthe son of Sapphias, who was then governor of Tiberias. Then it was that\r\nJosephus's friends, and the guards of his body, were so affrighted at\r\nthis violent assault of the multitude, that they all fled away but four;\r\nand as he was asleep, they awaked him, as the people were going to\r\nset fire to the house. And although those four that remained with him\r\npersuaded him to run away, he was neither surprised at his being himself\r\ndeserted, nor at the great multitude that came against him, but leaped\r\nout to them with his clothes rent, and ashes sprinkled on his head, with\r\nhis hands behind him, and his sword hanging at his neck. At this sight\r\nhis friends, especially those of Taricheae, commiserated his condition;\r\nbut those that came out of the country, and those in their neighborhood,\r\nto whom his government seemed burdensome, reproached him, and bid him\r\nproduce the money which belonged to them all immediately, and to confess\r\nthe agreement he had made to betray them; for they imagined, from the\r\nhabit in which he appeared, that he would deny nothing of what they\r\nsuspected concerning him, and that it was in order to obtain pardon that\r\nhe had put himself entirely into so pitiable a posture. But this humble\r\nappearance was only designed as preparatory to a stratagem of his, who\r\nthereby contrived to set those that were so angry at him at variance one\r\nwith another about the things they were angry at. However, he promised\r\nhe would confess all: hereupon he was permitted to speak, when he said,\r\n\"I did neither intend to send this money back to Agrippa, nor to gain it\r\nmyself; for I did never esteem one that was your enemy to be my friend,\r\nnor did I look upon what would tend to your disadvantage to be my\r\nadvantage. But, O you people of Tarieheae, I saw that your city stood in\r\nmore need than others of fortifications for your security, and that it\r\nwanted money in order for the building it a wall. I was also afraid lest\r\nthe people of Tiberias and other cities should lay a plot to seize upon\r\nthese spoils, and therefore it was that I intended to retain this money\r\nprivately, that I might encompass you with a wall. But if this does not\r\nplease you, I will produce what was brought me, and leave it to you to\r\nplunder it; but if I have conducted myself so well as to please you, you\r\nmay if you please punish your benefactor.\"\r\n\r\n4. Hereupon the people of Taricheae loudly commended him; but those\r\nof Tiberias, with the rest of the company, gave him hard names, and\r\nthreatened what they would do to him; so both sides left off quarrelling\r\nwith Josephus, and fell on quarrelling with one another. So he grew\r\nbold upon the dependence he had on his friends, which were the people of\r\nTaricheae, and about forty thousand in number, and spake more freely to\r\nthe whole multitude, and reproached them greatly for their rashness; and\r\ntold them, that with this money he would build walls about Taricheae,\r\nand would put the other cities in a state of security also; for that\r\nthey should not want money, if they would but agree for whose benefit\r\nit was to be procured, and would not suffer themselves to be irritated\r\nagainst him who procured it for them.\r\n\r\n5. Hereupon the rest of the multitude that had been deluded retired;\r\nbut yet so that they went away angry, and two thousand of them made an\r\nassault upon him in their armor; and as he was already gone to his own\r\nhouse, they stood without and threatened him. On which occasion Josephus\r\nagain used a second stratagem to escape them; for he got upon the top of\r\nhis house, and with his right hand desired them to be silent, and said\r\nto them, \"I cannot tell what you would have, nor can hear what you say,\r\nfor the confused noise you make;\" but he said that he would comply with\r\nall their demands, in case they would but send some of their number\r\nin to him that might talk with him about it. And when the principal of\r\nthem, with their leaders, heard this, they came into the house. He then\r\ndrew them to the most retired part of the house, and shut the door of\r\nthat hall where he put them, and then had them whipped till every one of\r\ntheir inward parts appeared naked. In the mean time the multitude stood\r\nround the house, and supposed that he had a long discourse with those\r\nthat were gone in about what they claimed of him. He had then the doors\r\nset open immediately, and sent the men out all bloody, which so terribly\r\naffrighted those that had before threatened him, that they threw away\r\ntheir arms and ran away.\r\n\r\n6. But as for John, his envy grew greater [upon this escape of\r\nJosephus], and he framed a new plot against him; he pretended to be\r\nsick, and by a letter desired that Josephus would give him leave to use\r\nthe hot baths that were at Tiberias, for the recovery of his health.\r\nHereupon Josephus, who hitherto suspected nothing of John's plots\r\nagainst him, wrote to the governors of the city, that they would provide\r\na lodging and necessaries for John; which favors, when he had made use\r\nof, in two days' time he did what he came about; some he corrupted with\r\ndelusive frauds, and others with money, and so persuaded them to revolt\r\nfrom Josephus. This Silas, who was appointed guardian of the city by\r\nJosephus, wrote to him immediately, and informed him of the plot against\r\nhim; which epistle when Josephus had received, he marched with great\r\ndiligence all night, and came early in the morning to Tiberias; at which\r\ntime the rest of the multitude met him. But John, who suspected that his\r\ncoming was not for his advantage, sent however one of his friends, and\r\npretended that he was sick, and that being confined to his bed, he could\r\nnot come to pay him his respects. But as soon as Josephus had got the\r\npeople of Tiberias together in the stadium, and tried to discourse with\r\nthem about the letters that he had received, John privately sent some\r\narmed men, and gave them orders to slay him. But when the people saw\r\nthat the armed men were about to draw their swords, they cried out; at\r\nwhich cry Josephus turned himself about, and when he saw that the\r\nswords were just at his throat, he marched away in great haste to the\r\nsea-shore, and left off that speech which he was going to make to the\r\npeople, upon an elevation of six cubits high. He then seized on a ship\r\nwhich lay in the haven, and leaped into it, with two of his guards, and\r\nfled away into the midst of the lake.\r\n\r\n7. But now the soldiers he had with him took up their arms immediately,\r\nand marched against the plotters; but Josephus was afraid lest a civil\r\nwar should be raised by the envy of a few men, and bring the city to\r\nruin; so he sent some of his party to tell them, that they should do no\r\nmore than provide for their own safety; that they should not kill any\r\nbody, nor accuse any for the occasion they had afforded [of disorder].\r\nAccordingly, these men obeyed his orders, and were quiet; but the people\r\nof the neighboring country, when they were informed of this plot, and of\r\nthe plotter, they got together in great multitudes to oppose John. But\r\nhe prevented their attempt, and fled away to Gischala, his native\r\ncity, while the Galileans came running out of their several cities to\r\nJosephus; and as they were now become many ten thousands of armed men,\r\nthey cried out, that they were come against John the common plotter\r\nagainst their interest, and would at the same time burn him, and that\r\ncity which had received him. Hereupon Josephus told them that he took\r\ntheir good-will to him kindly, but still he restrained their fury,\r\nand intended to subdue his enemies by prudent conduct, rather than by\r\nslaying them; so he excepted those of every city which had joined in\r\nthis revolt with John, by name, who had readily been shown him by these\r\nthat came from every city, and caused public proclamation to be made,\r\nthat he would seize upon the effects of those that did not forsake\r\nJohn within five days' time, and would burn both their houses and their\r\nfamilies with fire. Whereupon three thousand of John's party left him\r\nimmediately, who came to Josephus, and threw their arms down at his\r\nfeet. John then betook himself, together with his two thousand Syrian\r\nrunagates, from open attempts, to more secret ways of treachery.\r\nAccordingly, he privately sent messengers to Jerusalem, to accuse\r\nJosephus, as having to great power, and to let them know that he would\r\nsoon come as a tyrant to their metropolis, unless they prevented him.\r\nThis accusation the people were aware of beforehand, but had no regard\r\nto it. However, some of the grandees, out of envy, and some of the\r\nrulers also, sent money to John privately, that he might be able to get\r\ntogether mercenary soldiers, in order to fight Josephus; they also made\r\na decree of themselves, and this for recalling him from his government,\r\nyet did they not think that decree sufficient; so they sent withal two\r\nthousand five hundred armed men, and four persons of the highest rank\r\namongst them; Joazar the son of Nomicus, and Ananias the son of Sadduk,\r\nas also Simon and Judas the sons of Jonathan, all very able men in\r\nspeaking, that these persons might withdraw the good-will of the people\r\nfrom Josephus. These had it in charge, that if he would voluntarily\r\ncome away, they should permit him to [come and] give an account of\r\nhis conduct; but if he obstinately insisted upon continuing in his\r\ngovernment, they should treat him as an enemy. Now Josephus's friends\r\nhad sent him word that an army was coming against him, but they gave\r\nhim no notice beforehand what the reason of their coming was, that being\r\nonly known among some secret councils of his enemies; and by this means\r\nit was that four cities revolted from him immediately, Sepphoris, and\r\nGamala, and Gischala, and Tiberias. Yet did he recover these cities\r\nwithout war; and when he had routed those four commanders by stratagems,\r\nand had taken the most potent of their warriors, he sent them to\r\nJerusalem; and the people [of Galilee] had great indignation at them,\r\nand were in a zealous disposition to slay, not only these forces, but\r\nthose that sent them also, had not these forces prevented it by running\r\naway.\r\n\r\n8. Now John was detained afterward within the walls of Gischala, by\r\nthe fear he was in of Josephus; but within a few days Tiberias revolted\r\nagain, the people within it inviting king Agrippa [to return to the\r\nexercise of his authority there]. And when he did not come at the\r\ntime appointed, and when a few Roman horsemen appeared that day,\r\nthey expelled Josephus out of the city. Now this revolt of theirs was\r\npresently known at Taricheae; and as Josephus had sent out all the\r\nsoldiers that were with him to gather corn, he knew not how either to\r\nmarch out alone against the revolters, or to stay where he was, because\r\nhe was afraid the king's soldiers might prevent him if he tarried, and\r\nmight get into the city; for he did not intend to do any thing on\r\nthe next day, because it was the sabbath day, and would hinder his\r\nproceeding. So he contrived to circumvent the revolters by a stratagem;\r\nand in the first place he ordered the gates of Taricheae to be shut,\r\nthat nobody might go out and inform [those of Tiberias], for whom it\r\nwas intended, what stratagem he was about; he then got together all the\r\nships that were upon the lake, which were found to be two hundred and\r\nthirty, and in each of them he put no more than four mariners. So he\r\nsailed to Tiberias with haste, and kept at such a distance from the\r\ncity, that it was not easy for the people to see the vessels, and\r\nordered that the empty vessels should float up and down there, while\r\nhimself, who had but seven of his guards with him, and those unarmed\r\nalso, went so near as to be seen; but when his adversaries, who were\r\nstill reproaching him, saw him from the walls, they were so astonished\r\nthat they supposed all the ships were full of armed men, and threw down\r\ntheir arms, and by signals of intercession they besought him to spare\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n9. Upon this Josephus threatened them terribly, and reproached them,\r\nthat when they were the first that took up arms against the Romans, they\r\nshould spend their force beforehand in civil dissensions, and do what\r\ntheir enemies desired above all things; and that besides they should\r\nendeavor so hastily to seize upon him, who took care of their safety,\r\nand had not been ashamed to shut the gates of their city against\r\nhim that built their walls; that, however, he would admit of any\r\nintercessors from them that might make some excuse for them, and with\r\nwhom he would make such agreements as might be for the city's security.\r\nHereupon ten of the most potent men of Tiberias came down to him\r\npresently; and when he had taken them into one of his vessels, he\r\nordered them to be carried a great way off from the city. He then\r\ncommanded that fifty others of their senate, such as were men of the\r\ngreatest eminence, should come to him, that they also might give him\r\nsome security on their behalf. After which, under one new pretense or\r\nanother, he called forth others, one after another, to make the leagues\r\nbetween them. He then gave order to the masters of those vessels which\r\nhe had thus filled to sail away immediately for Taricheae, and to\r\nconfine those men in the prison there; till at length he took all their\r\nsenate, consisting of six hundred persons, and about two thousand of the\r\npopulace, and carried them away to Taricheae. 35\r\n\r\n10. And when the rest of the people cried out, that it was one Clitus\r\nthat was the chief author of this revolt, they desired him to spend\r\nhis anger upon him [only]; but Josephus, whose intention it was to slay\r\nnobody, commanded one Levius, belonging to his guards, to go out of the\r\nvessel, in order to cut off both Clitus's hands; yet was Levius afraid\r\nto go out by himself alone to such a large body of enemies, and refused\r\nto go. Now Clitus saw that Josephus was in a great passion in the ship,\r\nand ready to leap out of it, in order to execute the punishment himself;\r\nhe begged therefore from the shore, that he would leave him one of his\r\nhands; which Josephus agreed to, upon condition that he would himself\r\ncutoff the other hand; accordingly he drew his sword, and with his\r\nright hand cut off his left, so great was the fear he was in of\r\nJosephus himself. And thus he took the people of Tiberias prisoners,\r\nand recovered the city again with empty ships and seven of his guard.\r\nMoreover, a few days afterward he retook Gischala, which had revolted\r\nwith the people of Sepphoris, and gave his soldiers leave to plunder\r\nit; yet did he get all the plunder together, and restored it to the\r\ninhabitants; and the like he did to the inhabitants of Sepphoris and\r\nTiberias. For when he had subdued those cities, he had a mind, by\r\nletting them be plundered, to give them some good instruction, while at\r\nthe same time he regained their good-will by restoring them their money\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Jews Make All Ready For The War; And Simon, The Son Of\r\n     Gioras, Falls To Plundering.\r\n\r\n1. And thus were the disturbances of Galilee quieted, when, upon their\r\nceasing to prosecute their civil dissensions, they betook themselves to\r\nmake preparations for the war with the Romans. Now in Jerusalem the\r\nhigh priest Artanus, and as many of the men of power as were not in the\r\ninterest of the Romans, both repaired the walls, and made a great many\r\nwarlike instruments, insomuch that in all parts of the city darts and\r\nall sorts of armor were upon the anvil. Although the multitude of the\r\nyoung men were engaged in exercises, without any regularity, and all\r\nplaces were full of tumultuous doings; yet the moderate sort were\r\nexceedingly sad; and a great many there were who, out of the prospect\r\nthey had of the calamities that were coming upon them, made great\r\nlamentations. There were also such omens observed as were understood to\r\nbe forerunners of evils by such as loved peace, but were by those that\r\nkindled the war interpreted so as to suit their own inclinations; and\r\nthe very state of the city, even before the Romans came against it, was\r\nthat of a place doomed to destruction. However, Ananus's concern was\r\nthis, to lay aside, for a while, the preparations for the war, and to\r\npersuade the seditious to consult their own interest, and to restrain\r\nthe madness of those that had the name of zealots; but their violence\r\nwas too hard for him; and what end he came to we shall relate hereafter.\r\n\r\n2. But as for the Acrabbene toparchy, Simon, the son of Gioras, got a\r\ngreat number of those that were fond of innovations together, and betook\r\nhimself to ravage the country; nor did he only harass the rich men's\r\nhouses, but tormented their bodies, and appeared openly and beforehand\r\nto affect tyranny in his government. And when an army was sent against\r\nhim by Artanus, and the other rulers, he and his band retired to the\r\nrobbers that were at Masada, and staid there, and plundered the country\r\nof Idumea with them, till both Ananus and his other adversaries were\r\nslain; and until the rulers of that country were so afflicted with the\r\nmultitude of those that were slain, and with the continual ravage of\r\nwhat they had, that they raised an army, and put garrisons into the\r\nvillages, to secure them from those insults. And in this state were the\r\naffairs of Judea at that time.\r\n\r\nWAR BOOK 2 FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Hear Dean Aldrich's note on this place: \"The law or Custom\r\nof the Jews [says he] requires seven days' mourning for the dead,\"\r\nAntiq.

How it is certain that such a seven days'\r\nmourning has been customary from times of the greatest antiquity,\r\nGenesis 1:10.

However, what Josephus says in the name of\r\nthe Pharisees, that only the souls of good men go out of one body into\r\nanother, although all souls be immortal, and still the souls of the\r\nbad are liable to eternal punishment; as also what he says afterwards,\r\nAntiq.

Only Josephus's rejection of the return of the wicked into\r\nother bodies, or into this world, which he grants to the good, looks\r\nsomewhat like a contradiction to St. Paul's account of the doctrine\r\nof the Jews, that they \"themselves allowed that there should be a\r\nresurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust,\" Acts 24:15.

B. XX. ch. 7.\r\nsect. 1: in the words of Tacitus, produced here by Dean Aldrich: \"Felix\r\nexercised,\" says Tacitas, \"the authority of a king, with the disposition\r\nof a slave, and relying upon the great power of his brother Pallas\r\nat court, thought he might safely be guilty of all kinds of wicked\r\npractices.\" Observe also the time when he was made procurator, A.D. 52;\r\nthat when St. Paul pleaded his cause before him, A.D. 58, he might have\r\nbeen \"many years a judge unto that nation,\" as St. Paul says he had\r\nthen been, Acts 24:10. But as to what Tacitus here says, that before the\r\ndeath of Cumanus, Felix was procurator over Samaria only, does not well\r\nagree with St. Paul's words, who would hardly have called Samaria a\r\nJewish nation. In short, since what Tacitus here says is about countries\r\nvery remote from Rome, where he lived; since what he says of two Roman\r\nprocurators, the one over Galilee, the other over Samaria at the same\r\ntime, is without example elsewhere; and since Josephus, who lived\r\nat that very time in Judea, appears to have known nothing of this\r\nprocuratorship of Felix, before the death of Cumanus; I much suspect\r\nthe story itself as nothing better than a mistake of Tacitus, especially\r\nwhen it seems not only omitted, but contradicted by Josephus; as any one\r\nmay find that compares their histories together. Possibly Felix might\r\nhave been a subordinate judge among the Jews some time before under\r\nCumanus, but that he was in earnest a procurator of Samaria before I\r\ndo not believe.

However, these thirty days'\r\nabode at Jerusalem, for fasting and preparation against the oblation\r\nof a proper sacrifice, seems to be too long, unless it were wholly\r\nvoluntary in this great lady. It is not required in the law of Moses\r\nrelating to Nazarites, Numbers 6., and is very different from St. Paul's\r\ntime for such preparation, which was but one day, Acts 21:26. So we want\r\nalready the continuation of the Antiquities to afford us light here, as\r\nthey have hitherto done on so many occasions elsewhere. Perhaps in this\r\nage the traditions of the Pharisees had obliged the Jews to this degree\r\nof rigor, not only as to these thirty days' preparation, but as to the\r\ngoing barefoot all that time, which here Bernice submitted to also. For\r\nwe know that as God's and our Savior's yoke is usually easy, and his\r\nburden comparatively light, in such positive injunctions, Matthew 11:30,\r\nso did the scribes and Pharisees sometimes \"bind upon men heavy burdens,\r\nand grievous to be borne,\" even when they themselves \"would not touch\r\nthem with one of their fingers,\" Matthew 23:4; Luke 11:46.

III. ch. 5. sect. 7.

Nor may we omit\r\nAgrippa's constant doctrine here, that this vast Roman empire was raised\r\nand supported by Divine Providence, and that therefore it was in vain\r\nfor the Jews, or any others, to think of destroying it.

IV. ch. 5.\r\nsect. 2, who seems to have been the same who condemned St. James, bishop\r\nof Jerusalem, to be stoned, under Albinus the procurator, that when\r\nhe wrote these books of the War, he was not so much as an Ebionite\r\nChristian; otherwise he would not have failed, according to his usual\r\ncustom, to have reckoned this his barbarous murder as a just punishment\r\nupon him for that his cruelty to the chief, or rather only Christian\r\nbishop of the circumcision. Nor, had he been then a Christian, could he\r\nimmediately have spoken so movingly of the causes of the destruction\r\nof Jerusalem, without one word of either the condemnation of James,\r\nor crucifixion of Christ, as he did when he was become a Christian\r\nafterward.]\r\n\r\n\r\n34 (return) [ I should think that an army of sixty thousand footmen\r\nshould require many more than two hundred and fifty horsemen; and we\r\nfind Josephus had more horsemen under his command than two hundred and\r\nfifty in his future history.

When Nero was informed of the Romans' ill success in Judea, a\r\nconcealed consternation and terror, as is usual in such cases, fell upon\r\nhim; although he openly looked very big, and was very angry, and\r\nsaid that what had happened was rather owing to the negligence of the\r\ncommander, than to any valor of the enemy: and as he thought it fit\r\nfor him, who bare the burden of the whole empire, to despise such\r\nmisfortunes, he now pretended so to do, and to have a soul superior to\r\nall such sad accidents whatsoever. Yet did the disturbance that was in\r\nhis soul plainly appear by the solicitude he was in [how to recover his\r\naffairs again].\r\n\r\n2. And as he was deliberating to whom he should commit the care of the\r\nEast, now it was in so great a commotion, and who might be best able\r\nto punish the Jews for their rebellion, and might prevent the same\r\ndistemper from seizing upon the neighboring nations also,--he found\r\nno one but Vespasian equal to the task, and able to undergo the great\r\nburden of so mighty a war, seeing he was growing an old man already in\r\nthe camp, and from his youth had been exercised in warlike exploits: he\r\nwas also a man that had long ago pacified the west, and made it subject\r\nto the Romans, when it had been put into disorder by the Germans; he had\r\nalso recovered to them Britain by his arms, which had been little known\r\nbefore 1 whereby he procured to his father Claudius to have a triumph\r\nbestowed on him without any sweat or labor of his own.\r\n\r\n3. So Nero esteemed these circumstances as favorable omens, and saw that\r\nVespasian's age gave him sure experience, and great skill, and that\r\nhe had his sons as hostages for his fidelity to himself, and that the\r\nflourishing age they were in would make them fit instruments under\r\ntheir father's prudence. Perhaps also there was some interposition\r\nof Providence, which was paving the way for Vespasian's being himself\r\nemperor afterwards. Upon the whole, he sent this man to take upon him\r\nthe command of the armies that were in Syria; but this not without great\r\nencomiums and flattering compellations, such as necessity required, and\r\nsuch as might mollify him into complaisance. So Vespasian sent his son\r\nTitus from Achaia, where he had been with Nero, to Alexandria, to bring\r\nback with him from thence the fifth and the tenth legions, while he\r\nhimself, when he had passed over the Hellespont, came by land into\r\nSyria, where he gathered together the Roman forces, with a considerable\r\nnumber of auxiliaries from the kings in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A Great Slaughter About Ascalon. Vespasian Comes To\r\n     Ptolemais.\r\n\r\n1. Now the Jews, after they had beaten Cestius, were so much elevated\r\nwith their unexpected success, that they could not govern their zeal,\r\nbut, like people blown up into a flame by their good fortune, carried\r\nthe war to remoter places. Accordingly, they presently got together a\r\ngreat multitude of all their most hardy soldiers, and marched away for\r\nAscalon. This is an ancient city that is distant from Jerusalem five\r\nhundred and twenty furlongs, and was always an enemy to the Jews; on\r\nwhich account they determined to make their first effort against it, and\r\nto make their approaches to it as near as possible. This excursion was\r\nled on by three men, who were the chief of them all, both for strength\r\nand sagacity; Niger, called the Persite, Silas of Babylon, and besides\r\nthem John the Essene. Now Ascalon was strongly walled about, but had\r\nalmost no assistance to be relied on [near them], for the garrison\r\nconsisted of one cohort of footmen, and one troop of horsemen, whose\r\ncaptain was Antonius.\r\n\r\n2. These Jews, therefore, out of their anger, marched faster than\r\nordinary, and, as if they had come but a little way, approached very\r\nnear the city, and were come even to it; but Antonius, who was not\r\nunapprized of the attack they were going to make upon the city, drew out\r\nhis horsemen beforehand, and being neither daunted at the multitude,\r\nnor at the courage of the enemy, received their first attacks with great\r\nbravery; and when they crowded to the very walls, he beat them off. Now\r\nthe Jews were unskillful in war, but were to fight with those who were\r\nskillful therein; they were footmen to fight with horsemen; they were\r\nin disorder, to fight those that were united together; they were poorly\r\narmed, to fight those that were completely so; they were to fight more\r\nby their rage than by sober counsel, and were exposed to soldiers that\r\nwere exactly obedient; and did every thing they were bidden upon the\r\nleast intimation. So they were easily beaten; for as soon as ever\r\ntheir first ranks were once in disorder, they were put to flight by the\r\nenemy's cavalry, and those of them that came behind such as crowded to\r\nthe wall fell upon their own party's weapons, and became one another's\r\nenemies; and this so long till they were all forced to give way to the\r\nattacks of the horsemen, and were dispersed all the plain over, which\r\nplain was wide, and all fit for the horsemen; which circumstance was\r\nvery commodious for the Romans, and occasioned the slaughter of the\r\ngreatest number of the Jews; for such as ran away, they could overrun\r\nthem, and make them turn back; and when they had brought them back after\r\ntheir flight, and driven them together, they ran them through, and slew\r\na vast number of them, insomuch that others encompassed others of them,\r\nand drove them before them whithersoever they turned themselves, and\r\nslew them easily with their arrows; and the great number there were of\r\nthe Jews seemed a solitude to themselves, by reason of the distress they\r\nwere in, while the Romans had such good success with their small number,\r\nthat they seemed to themselves to be the greater multitude. And as the\r\nformer strove zealously under their misfortunes, out of the shame of\r\na sudden flight, and hopes of the change in their success, so did the\r\nlatter feel no weariness by reason of their good fortune; insomuch that\r\nthe fight lasted till the evening, till ten thousand men of the Jews'\r\nside lay dead, with two of their generals, John and Silas, and the\r\ngreater part of the remainder were wounded, with Niger, their remaining\r\ngeneral, who fled away together to a small city of Idumea, called\r\nSallis. Some few also of the Romans were wounded in this battle.\r\n\r\n3. Yet were not the spirits of the Jews broken by so great a calamity,\r\nbut the losses they had sustained rather quickened their resolution for\r\nother attempts; for, overlooking the dead bodies which lay under their\r\nfeet, they were enticed by their former glorious actions to venture on\r\na second destruction; so when they had lain still so little a while that\r\ntheir wounds were not yet thoroughly cured, they got together all their\r\nforces, and came with greater fury, and in much greater numbers, to\r\nAscalon. But their former ill fortune followed them, as the consequence\r\nof their unskilfulness, and other deficiencies in war; for Antonius laid\r\nambushes for them in the passages they were to go through, where they\r\nfell into snares unexpectedly, and where they were encompassed about\r\nwith horsemen, before they could form themselves into a regular body for\r\nfighting, and were above eight thousand of them slain; so all the rest\r\nof them ran away, and with them Niger, who still did a great many bold\r\nexploits in his flight. However, they were driven along together by the\r\nenemy, who pressed hard upon them, into a certain strong tower belonging\r\nto a village called Bezedeh However, Antonius and his party, that they\r\nmight neither spend any considerable time about this tower, which was\r\nhard to be taken, nor suffer their commander, and the most courageous\r\nman of them all, to escape from them, they set the wall on fire; and as\r\nthe tower was burning, the Romans went away rejoicing, as taking it for\r\ngranted that Niger was destroyed; but he leaped out of the tower into a\r\nsubterraneous cave, in the innermost part of it, and was preserved; and\r\non the third day afterward he spake out of the ground to those that with\r\ngreat lamentation were searching for him, in order to give him a decent\r\nfuneral; and when he was come out, he filled all the Jews with an\r\nunexpected joy, as though he were preserved by God's providence to be\r\ntheir commander for the time to come.\r\n\r\n4. And now Vespasian took along with him his army from Antioch, [which\r\nis the metropolis of Syria, and without dispute deserves the place of\r\nthe third city in the habitable earth that was under the Roman empire,\r\n2 both in magnitude, and other marks of prosperity,] where he found king\r\nAgrippa, with all his forces, waiting for his coming, and marched to\r\nPtolemais. At this city also the inhabitants of Sepphoris of Galilee met\r\nhim, who were for peace with the Romans. These citizens had beforehand\r\ntaken care of their own safety, and being sensible of the power of the\r\nRomans, they had been with Cestius Gallus before Vespasian came, and had\r\ngiven their faith to him, and received the security of his right hand,\r\nand had received a Roman garrison; and at this time withal they received\r\nVespasian, the Roman general, very kindly, and readily promised that\r\nthey would assist him against their own countrymen. Now the general\r\ndelivered them, at their desire, as many horsemen and footmen as he\r\nthought sufficient to oppose the incursions of the Jews, if they should\r\ncome against them. And indeed the danger of losing Sepphoris would be no\r\nsmall one, in this war that was now beginning, seeing it was the largest\r\ncity of Galilee, and built in a place by nature very strong, and might\r\nbe a security of the whole nation's [fidelity to the Romans].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A Description Of Galilee, Samaria, And Judea.\r\n\r\n1. Now Phoenicia and Syria encompass about the Galilees, which are two,\r\nand called the Upper Galilee and the Lower. They are bounded toward the\r\nsun-setting, with the borders of the territory belonging to Ptolemais,\r\nand by Carmel; which mountain had formerly belonged to the Galileans,\r\nbut now belonged to the Tyrians; to which mountain adjoins Gaba,\r\nwhich is called the City of Horsemen, because those horsemen that were\r\ndismissed by Herod the king dwelt therein; they are bounded on the south\r\nwith Samaria and Scythopolis, as far as the river Jordan; on the east\r\nwith Hippeae and Gadaris, and also with Ganlonitis, and the borders of\r\nthe kingdom of Agrippa; its northern parts are bounded by Tyre, and the\r\ncountry of the Tyrians. As for that Galilee which is called the Lower,\r\nit, extends in length from Tiberias to Zabulon, and of the maritime\r\nplaces Ptolemais is its neighbor; its breadth is from the village called\r\nXaloth, which lies in the great plain, as far as Bersabe, from which\r\nbeginning also is taken the breadth of the Upper Galilee, as far as the\r\nvillage Baca, which divides the land of the Tyrians from it; its length\r\nis also from Meloth to Thella, a village near to Jordan.\r\n\r\n2. These two Galilees, of so great largeness, and encompassed with\r\nso many nations of foreigners, have been always able to make a strong\r\nresistance on all occasions of war; for the Galileans are inured to war\r\nfrom their infancy, and have been always very numerous; nor hath the\r\ncountry been ever destitute of men of courage, or wanted a numerous set\r\nof them; for their soil is universally rich and fruitful, and full of\r\nthe plantations of trees of all sorts, insomuch that it invites the\r\nmost slothful to take pains in its cultivation, by its fruitfulness;\r\naccordingly, it is all cultivated by its inhabitants, and no part of it\r\nlies idle. Moreover, the cities lie here very thick, and the very\r\nmany villages there are here are every where so full of people, by\r\nthe richness of their soil, that the very least of them contain above\r\nfifteen thousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\n3. In short, if any one will suppose that Galilee is inferior to Perea\r\nin magnitude, he will be obliged to prefer it before it in its strength;\r\nfor this is all capable of cultivation, and is every where fruitful; but\r\nfor Perea, which is indeed much larger in extent, the greater part of\r\nit is desert and rough, and much less disposed for the production of the\r\nmilder kinds of fruits; yet hath it a moist soil [in other parts], and\r\nproduces all kinds of fruits, and its plains are planted with trees of\r\nall sorts, while yet the olive tree, the vine, and the palm tree are\r\nchiefly cultivated there. It is also sufficiently watered with torrents,\r\nwhich issue out of the mountains, and with springs that never fail to\r\nrun, even when the torrents fail them, as they do in the dog-days. Now\r\nthe length of Perea is from Machaerus to Pella, and its breadth from\r\nPhiladelphia to Jordan; its northern parts are bounded by Pella, as we\r\nhave already said, as well as its Western with Jordan; the land of Moab\r\nis its southern border, and its eastern limits reach to Arabia, and\r\nSilbonitis, and besides to Philadelphene and Gerasa.\r\n\r\n4. Now as to the country of Samaria, it lies between Judea and Galilee;\r\nit begins at a village that is in the great plain called Ginea, and\r\nends at the Acrabbene toparchy, and is entirely of the same nature with\r\nJudea; for both countries are made up of hills and valleys, and are\r\nmoist enough for agriculture, and are very fruitful. They have abundance\r\nof trees, and are full of autumnal fruit, both that which grows wild,\r\nand that which is the effect of cultivation. They are not naturally\r\nwatered by many rivers, but derive their chief moisture from rain-water,\r\nof which they have no want; and for those rivers which they have, all\r\ntheir waters are exceeding sweet: by reason also of the excellent grass\r\nthey have, their cattle yield more milk than do those in other places;\r\nand, what is the greatest sign of excellency and of abundance, they each\r\nof them are very full of people.\r\n\r\n5. In the limits of Samaria and Judea lies the village Anuath, which is\r\nalso named Borceos. This is the northern boundary of Judea. The southern\r\nparts of Judea, if they be measured lengthways, are bounded by a Village\r\nadjoining to the confines of Arabia; the Jews that dwell there call it\r\nJordan. However, its breadth is extended from the river Jordan to Joppa.\r\nThe city Jerusalem is situated in the very middle; on which account some\r\nhave, with sagacity enough, called that city the Navel of the country.\r\nNor indeed is Judea destitute of such delights as come from the sea,\r\nsince its maritime places extend as far as Ptolemais: it was parted into\r\neleven portions, of which the royal city Jerusalem was the supreme, and\r\npresided over all the neighboring country, as the head does over the\r\nbody. As to the other cities that were inferior to it, they presided\r\nover their several toparchies; Gophna was the second of those cities,\r\nand next to that Acrabatta, after them Thamna, and Lydda, and Emmaus,\r\nand Pella, and Idumea, and Engaddi, and Herodium, and Jericho; and after\r\nthem came Jamnia and Joppa, as presiding over the neighboring people;\r\nand besides these there was the region of Gamala, and Gaulonitis,\r\nand Batanea, and Trachonitis, which are also parts of the kingdom of\r\nAgrippa. This [last] country begins at Mount Libanus, and the fountains\r\nof Jordan, and reaches breadthways to the lake of Tiberias; and in\r\nlength is extended from a village called Arpha, as far as Julias. Its\r\ninhabitants are a mixture of Jews and Syrians. And thus have I, with\r\nall possible brevity, described the country of Judea, and those that lie\r\nround about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Josephus Makes An Attempt Upon Sepphoris But Is Repelled.\r\n     Titus Comes With A Great Army To Ptolemais.\r\n\r\n1. Now the auxiliaries which were sent to assist the people of\r\nSepphoris, being a thousand horsemen, and six thousand footmen, under\r\nPlacidus the tribune, pitched their camp in two bodies in the great\r\nplain. The foot were put into the city to be a guard to it, but the\r\nhorse lodged abroad in the camp. These last, by marching continually one\r\nway or other, and overrunning the parts of the adjoining country, were\r\nvery troublesome to Josephus and his men; they also plundered all the\r\nplaces that were out of the city's liberty, and intercepted such as\r\ndurst go abroad. On this account it was that Josephus marched against\r\nthe city, as hoping to take what he had lately encompassed with so\r\nstrong a wall, before they revolted from the rest of the Galileans, that\r\nthe Romans would have much ado to take it; by which means he proved too\r\nweak, and failed of his hopes, both as to the forcing the place, and as\r\nto his prevailing with the people of Sepphoris to deliver it up to him.\r\nBy this means he provoked the Romans to treat the country according to\r\nthe law of war; nor did the Romans, out of the anger they bore at this\r\nattempt, leave off, either by night or by day, burning the places in\r\nthe plain, and stealing away the cattle that were in the country, and\r\nkilling whatsoever appeared capable of fighting perpetually, and leading\r\nthe weaker people as slaves into captivity; so that Galilee was all over\r\nfilled with fire and blood; nor was it exempted from any kind of misery\r\nor calamity, for the only refuge they had was this, that when they were\r\npursued, they could retire to the cities which had walls built them by\r\nJosephus.\r\n\r\n2. But as to Titus, he sailed over from Achaia to Alexandria, and that\r\nsooner than the winter season did usually permit; so he took with him\r\nthose forces he was sent for, and marching with great expedition, he\r\ncame suddenly to Ptolemais, and there finding his father, together with\r\nthe two legions, the fifth and the tenth, which were the most eminent\r\nlegions of all, he joined them to that fifteenth legion which was with\r\nhis father; eighteen cohorts followed these legions; there came also\r\nfive cohorts from Cesarea, with one troop of horsemen, and five other\r\ntroops of horsemen from Syria. Now these ten cohorts had severally a\r\nthousand footmen, but the other thirteen cohorts had no more than six\r\nhundred footmen apiece, with a hundred and twenty horsemen. There were\r\nalso a considerable number of auxiliaries got together, that came from\r\nthe kings Antiochus, and Agrippa, and Sohemus, each of them contributing\r\none thousand footmen that were archers, and a thousand horsemen.\r\nMalchus also, the king of Arabia, sent a thousand horsemen, besides five\r\nthousand footmen, the greatest part of which were archers; so that\r\nthe whole army, including the auxiliaries sent by the kings, as well\r\nhorsemen as footmen, when all were united together, amounted to sixty\r\nthousand, besides the servants, who, as they followed in vast numbers,\r\nso because they had been trained up in war with the rest, ought not\r\nto be distinguished from the fighting men; for as they were in their\r\nmasters' service in times of peace, so did they undergo the like dangers\r\nwith them in times of war, insomuch that they were inferior to none,\r\neither in skill or in strength, only they were subject to their masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A Description Of The Roman Armies And Roman Camps And Of\r\n     Other Particulars For Which The Romans Are Commended.\r\n\r\n1. Now here one cannot but admire at the precaution of the Romans, in\r\nproviding themselves of such household servants, as might not only serve\r\nat other times for the common offices of life, but might also be of\r\nadvantage to them in their wars. And, indeed, if any one does but attend\r\nto the other parts of their military discipline, he will be forced\r\nto confess that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the\r\nacquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune; for they\r\ndo not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they then\r\nput their hands first into motion, while they avoided so to do in times\r\nof peace; but, as if their weapons did always cling to them, they have\r\nnever any truce from warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of\r\nwar admonish them to use them; for their military exercises differ not\r\nat all from the real use of their arms, but every soldier is every day\r\nexercised, and that with great diligence, as if it were in time of war,\r\nwhich is the reason why they bear the fatigue of battles so easily; for\r\nneither can any disorder remove them from their usual regularity,\r\nnor can fear affright them out of it, nor can labor tire them; which\r\nfirmness of conduct makes them always to overcome those that have not\r\nthe same firmness; nor would he be mistaken that should call those their\r\nexercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. Nor\r\ncan their enemies easily surprise them with the suddenness of their\r\nincursions; for as soon as they have marched into an enemy's land, they\r\ndo not begin to fight till they have walled their camp about; nor is the\r\nfence they raise rashly made, or uneven; nor do they all abide in it,\r\nnor do those that are in it take their places at random; but if it\r\nhappens that the ground is uneven, it is first leveled: their camp is\r\nalso four-square by measure, and carpenters are ready, in great numbers,\r\nwith their tools, to erect their buildings for them. 3\r\n\r\n2. As for what is within the camp, it is set apart for tents, but the\r\noutward circumference hath the resemblance to a wall, and is adorned\r\nwith towers at equal distances, where between the towers stand the\r\nengines for throwing arrows and darts, and for slinging stones, and\r\nwhere they lay all other engines that can annoy the enemy, all ready for\r\ntheir several operations. They also erect four gates, one at every side\r\nof the circumference, and those large enough for the entrance of the\r\nbeasts, and wide enough for making excursions, if occasion should\r\nrequire. They divide the camp within into streets, very conveniently,\r\nand place the tents of the commanders in the middle; but in the very\r\nmidst of all is the general's own tent, in the nature of a temple,\r\ninsomuch, that it appears to be a city built on the sudden, with its\r\nmarket-place, and place for handicraft trades, and with seats for the\r\nofficers superior and inferior, where, if any differences arise, their\r\ncauses are heard and determined. The camp, and all that is in it, is\r\nencompassed with a wall round about, and that sooner than one would\r\nimagine, and this by the multitude and the skill of the laborers; and,\r\nif occasion require, a trench is drawn round the whole, whose depth is\r\nfour cubits, and its breadth equal.\r\n\r\n3. When they have thus secured themselves, they live together by\r\ncompanies, with quietness and decency, as are all their other affairs\r\nmanaged with good order and security. Each company hath also their wood,\r\nand their corn, and their water brought them, when they stand in need\r\nof them; for they neither sup nor dine as they please themselves singly,\r\nbut all together. Their times also for sleeping, and watching, and\r\nrising are notified beforehand by the sound of trumpets, nor is any\r\nthing done without such a signal; and in the morning the soldiery go\r\nevery one to their centurions, and these centurions to their tribunes,\r\nto salute them; with whom all the superior officers go to the general\r\nof the whole army, who then gives them of course the watchword and other\r\norders, to be by them carried to all that are under their command; which\r\nis also observed when they go to fight, and thereby they turn themselves\r\nabout on the sudden, when there is occasion for making sallies, as they\r\ncome back when they are recalled in crowds also.\r\n\r\n4. Now when they are to go out of their camp, the trumpet gives a sound,\r\nat which time nobody lies still, but at the first intimation they take\r\ndown their tents, and all is made ready for their going out; then do the\r\ntrumpets sound again, to order them to get ready for the march; then do\r\nthey lay their baggage suddenly upon their mules, and other beasts of\r\nburden, and stand, as at the place of starting, ready to march; when\r\nalso they set fire to their camp, and this they do because it will be\r\neasy for them to erect another camp, and that it may not ever be of use\r\nto their enemies. Then do the trumpets give a sound the third time, that\r\nthey are to go out, in order to excite those that on any account are\r\na little tardy, that so no one may be out of his rank when the army\r\nmarches. Then does the crier stand at the general's right hand, and asks\r\nthem thrice, in their own tongue, whether they be now ready to go out\r\nto war or not? To which they reply as often, with a loud and cheerful\r\nvoice, saying, \"We are ready.\" And this they do almost before the\r\nquestion is asked them: they do this as filled with a kind of martial\r\nfury, and at the same time that they so cry out, they lift up their\r\nright hands also.\r\n\r\n5. When, after this, they are gone out of their camp, they all march\r\nwithout noise, and in a decent manner, and every one keeps his own rank,\r\nas if they were going to war. The footmen are armed with breastplates\r\nand head-pieces, and have swords on each side; but the sword which is\r\nupon their left side is much longer than the other, for that on the\r\nright side is not longer than a span. Those foot-men also that are\r\nchosen out from the rest to be about the general himself have a lance\r\nand a buckler, but the rest of the foot soldiers have a spear and a long\r\nbuckler, besides a saw and a basket, a pick-axe and an axe, a thong of\r\nleather and a hook, with provisions for three days, so that a footman\r\nhath no great need of a mule to carry his burdens. The horsemen have\r\na long sword on their right sides, axed a long pole in their hand; a\r\nshield also lies by them obliquely on one side of their horses, with\r\nthree or more darts that are borne in their quiver, having broad\r\npoints, and not smaller than spears. They have also head-pieces and\r\nbreastplates, in like manner as have all the footmen. And for those that\r\nare chosen to be about the general, their armor no way differs from\r\nthat of the horsemen belonging to other troops; and he always leads the\r\nlegions forth to whom the lot assigns that employment.\r\n\r\n6. This is the manner of the marching and resting of the Romans, as also\r\nthese are the several sorts of weapons they use. But when they are to\r\nfight, they leave nothing without forecast, nor to be done off-hand, but\r\ncounsel is ever first taken before any work is begun, and what hath been\r\nthere resolved upon is put in execution presently; for which reason they\r\nseldom commit any errors; and if they have been mistaken at any time,\r\nthey easily correct those mistakes. They also esteem any errors they\r\ncommit upon taking counsel beforehand to be better than such rash\r\nsuccess as is owing to fortune only; because such a fortuitous advantage\r\ntempts them to be inconsiderate, while consultation, though it may\r\nsometimes fail of success, hath this good in it, that it makes men more\r\ncareful hereafter; but for the advantages that arise from chance,\r\nthey are not owing to him that gains them; and as to what melancholy\r\naccidents happen unexpectedly, there is this comfort in them, that they\r\nhad however taken the best consultations they could to prevent them.\r\n\r\n7. Now they so manage their preparatory exercises of their weapons, that\r\nnot the bodies of the soldiers only, but their souls may also become\r\nstronger: they are moreover hardened for war by fear; for their laws\r\ninflict capital punishments, not only for soldiers running away from the\r\nranks, but for slothfulness and inactivity, though it be but in a lesser\r\ndegree; as are their generals more severe than their laws, for they\r\nprevent any imputation of cruelty toward those under condemnation, by\r\nthe great rewards they bestow on the valiant soldiers; and the readiness\r\nof obeying their commanders is so great, that it is very ornamental in\r\npeace; but when they come to a battle, the whole army is but one body,\r\nso well coupled together are their ranks, so sudden are their turnings\r\nabout, so sharp their hearing as to what orders are given them, so quick\r\ntheir sight of the ensigns, and so nimble are their hands when they set\r\nto work; whereby it comes to pass that what they do is done quickly, and\r\nwhat they suffer they bear with the greatest patience. Nor can we find\r\nany examples where they have been conquered in battle, when they came\r\nto a close fight, either by the multitude of the enemies, or by their\r\nstratagems, or by the difficulties in the places they were in; no, nor\r\nby fortune neither, for their victories have been surer to them than\r\nfortune could have granted them. In a case, therefore, where counsel\r\nstill goes before action, and where, after taking the best advice,\r\nthat advice is followed by so active an army, what wonder is it that\r\nEuphrates on the east, the ocean on the west, the most fertile regions\r\nof Libya on the south, and the Danube and the Rhine on the north, are\r\nthe limits of this empire? One might well say that the Roman possessions\r\nare not inferior to the Romans themselves.\r\n\r\n8. This account I have given the reader, not so much with the intention\r\nof commending the Romans, as of comforting those that have been\r\nconquered by them, and for the deterring others from attempting\r\ninnovations under their government. This discourse of the Roman military\r\nconduct may also perhaps be of use to such of the curious as are\r\nignorant of it, and yet have a mind to know it. I return now from this\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Placidus Attempts To Take Jotapata And Is Beaten Off.\r\n     Vespasian Marches Into Galilee.\r\n\r\n1. And now Vespasian, with his son Titus, had tarried some time at\r\nPtolemais, and had put his army in order. But when Placidus, who had\r\noverrun Galilee, and had besides slain a number of those whom he had\r\ncaught, [which were only the weaker part of the Galileans, and such\r\nas were of timorous souls,] saw that the warriors ran always to those\r\ncities whose walls had been built by Josephus, he marched furiously\r\nagainst Jotapata, which was of them all the strongest, as supposing he\r\nshould easily take it by a sudden surprise, and that he should thereby\r\nobtain great honor to himself among the commanders, and bring a great\r\nadvantage to them in their future campaign; because if this strongest\r\nplace of them all were once taken, the rest would be so affrighted as to\r\nsurrender themselves. But he was mightily mistaken in his undertaking;\r\nfor the men of Jotapata were apprized of his coming to attack them, and\r\ncame out of the city, and expected him there. So they fought the Romans\r\nbriskly when they least expected it, being both many in number, and\r\nprepared for fighting, and of great alacrity, as esteeming their\r\ncountry, their wives, and their children to be in danger, and easily put\r\nthe Romans to flight, and wounded many of them, and slew seven of them;\r\n4 because their retreat was not made in a disorderly manner, because\r\nthe strokes only touched the surface of their bodies, which were covered\r\nwith their armor in all parts, and because the Jews did rather throw\r\ntheir weapons upon them from a great distance, than venture to come hand\r\nto hand with them, and had only light armor on, while the others were\r\ncompletely armed. However, three men of the Jews' side were slain, and\r\na few wounded; so Placidus, finding himself unable to assault the city,\r\nran away.\r\n\r\n2. But as Vespasian had a great mind to fall upon Galilee, he marched\r\nout of Ptolemais, having put his army into that order wherein the Romans\r\nused to march. He ordered those auxiliaries which were lightly armed,\r\nand the archers, to march first, that they might prevent any sudden\r\ninsults from the enemy, and might search out the woods that looked\r\nsuspiciously, and were capable of ambuscades. Next to these followed\r\nthat part of the Romans which was completely armed, both footmen and\r\nhorsemen. Next to these followed ten out of every hundred, carrying\r\nalong with them their arms, and what was necessary to measure out a camp\r\nwithal; and after them, such as were to make the road even and straight,\r\nand if it were any where rough and hard to be passed over, to plane it,\r\nand to cut down the woods that hindered their march, that the army might\r\nnot be in distress, or tired with their march. Behind these he set\r\nsuch carriages of the army as belonged both to himself and to the other\r\ncommanders, with a considerable number of their horsemen for their\r\nsecurity. After these he marched himself, having with him a select body\r\nof footmen, and horsemen, and pikemen. After these came the peculiar\r\ncavalry of his own legion, for there were a hundred and twenty horsemen\r\nthat peculiarly belonged to every legion. Next to these came the mules\r\nthat carried the engines for sieges, and the other warlike machines\r\nof that nature. After these came the commanders of the cohorts and\r\ntribunes, having about them soldiers chosen out of the rest. Then came\r\nthe ensigns encompassing the eagle, which is at the head of every Roman\r\nlegion, the king, and the strongest of all birds, which seems to them a\r\nsignal of dominion, and an omen that they shall conquer all against whom\r\nthey march; these sacred ensigns are followed by the trumpeters. Then\r\ncame the main army in their squadrons and battalions, with six men in\r\ndepth, which were followed at last by a centurion, who, according to\r\ncustom, observed the rest. As for the servants of every legion, they\r\nall followed the footmen, and led the baggage of the soldiers, which\r\nwas borne by the mules and other beasts of burden. But behind all the\r\nlegions came the whole multitude of the mercenaries; and those that\r\nbrought up the rear came last of all for the security of the whole army,\r\nbeing both footmen, and those in their armor also, with a great number\r\nof horsemen.\r\n\r\n3. And thus did Vespasian march with his army, and came to the bounds of\r\nGalilee, where he pitched his camp and restrained his soldiers, who\r\nwere eager for war; he also showed his army to the enemy, in order\r\nto affright them, and to afford them a season for repentance, to see\r\nwhether they would change their minds before it came to a battle, and at\r\nthe same time he got things ready for besieging their strong minds. And\r\nindeed this sight of the general brought many to repent of their revolt,\r\nand put them all into a consternation; for those that were in Josephus's\r\ncamp, which was at the city called Garis, not far from Sepphoris, when\r\nthey heard that the war was come near them, and that the Romans would\r\nsuddenly fight them hand to hand, dispersed themselves and fled, not\r\nonly before they came to a battle, but before the enemy ever came in\r\nsight, while Josephus and a few others were left behind; and as he saw\r\nthat he had not an army sufficient to engage the enemy, that the spirits\r\nof the Jews were sunk, and that the greater part would willingly come to\r\nterms, if they might be credited, he already despaired of the success of\r\nthe whole war, and determined to get as far as he possibly could out\r\nof danger; so he took those that staid along with him, and fled to\r\nTiberias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Vespasian, When He Had Taken The City Gadaea Marches To\r\n     Jotapata. After A Long Siege The City Is Betrayed By A\r\n     Deserter, And Taken By Vespasian.\r\n\r\n1. So Vespasian marched to the city Gadara, and took it upon the first\r\nonset, because he found it destitute of any considerable number of men\r\ngrown up and fit for war. He came then into it, and slew all the youth,\r\nthe Romans having no mercy on any age whatsoever; and this was done out\r\nof the hatred they bore the nation, and because of the iniquity they had\r\nbeen guilty of in the affair of Cestius. He also set fire not only to\r\nthe city itself, but to all the villas and small cities that were round\r\nabout it; some of them were quite destitute of inhabitants, and out of\r\nsome of them he carried the inhabitants as slaves into captivity.\r\n\r\n2. As to Josephus, his retiring to that city which he chose as the most\r\nfit for his security, put it into great fear; for the people of Tiberias\r\ndid not imagine that he would have run away, unless he had entirely\r\ndespaired of the success of the war. And indeed, as to that point, they\r\nwere not mistaken about his opinion; for he saw whither the affairs of\r\nthe Jews would tend at last, and was sensible that they had but one way\r\nof escaping, and that was by repentance. However, although he expected\r\nthat the Romans would forgive him, yet did he choose to die many times\r\nover, rather than to betray his country, and to dishonor that supreme\r\ncommand of the army which had been intrusted with him, or to live\r\nhappily under those against whom he was sent to fight. He determined,\r\ntherefore, to give an exact account of affairs to the principal men at\r\nJerusalem by a letter, that he might not, by too much aggrandizing the\r\npower of the enemy, make them too timorous; nor, by relating that their\r\npower beneath the truth, might encourage them to stand out when they\r\nwere perhaps disposed to repentance. He also sent them word, that if\r\nthey thought of coming to terms, they must suddenly write him an answer;\r\nor if they resolved upon war, they must send him an army sufficient\r\nto fight the Romans. Accordingly, he wrote these things, and sent\r\nmessengers immediately to carry his letter to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3. Now Vespasian was very desirous of demolishing Jotapata, for he had\r\ngotten intelligence that the greatest part of the enemy had retired\r\nthither, and that it was, on other accounts, a place of great security\r\nto them. Accordingly, he sent both foot-men and horsemen to level the\r\nroad, which was mountainous and rocky, not without difficulty to be\r\ntraveled over by footmen, but absolutely impracticable for horsemen. Now\r\nthese workmen accomplished what they were about in four days' time,\r\nand opened a broad way for the army. On the fifth day, which was the\r\ntwenty-first of the month Artemisius, [Jyar,] Josephus prevented him,\r\nand came from Tiberias, and went into Jotapata, and raised the drooping\r\nspirits of the Jews. And a certain deserter told this good news to\r\nVespasian, that Josephus had removed himself thither, which made him\r\nmake haste to the city, as supposing that with taking that he should\r\ntake all Judea, in case he could but withal get Josephus under his\r\npower. So he took this news to be of the vastest advantage to him, and\r\nbelieved it to be brought about by the providence of God, that he who\r\nappeared to be the most prudent man of all their enemies, had, of his\r\nown accord, shut himself up in a place of sure custody. Accordingly, he\r\nsent Placidus with a thousand horsemen, and Ebutius a decurion, a person\r\nthat was of eminency both in council and in action, to encompass the\r\ncity round, that Josephus might not escape away privately.\r\n\r\n4. Vespasian also, the very next day, took his whole army and followed\r\nthem, and by marching till late in the evening, arrived then at\r\nJotapata; and bringing his army to the northern side of the city, he\r\npitched his camp on a certain small hill which was seven furlongs from\r\nthe city, and still greatly endeavored to be well seen by the enemy, to\r\nput them into a consternation; which was indeed so terrible to the Jews\r\nimmediately, that no one of them durst go out beyond the wall. Yet did\r\nthe Romans put off the attack at that time, because they had marched all\r\nthe day, although they placed a double row of battalions round the\r\ncity, with a third row beyond them round the whole, which consisted of\r\ncavalry, in order to stop up every way for an exit; which thing making\r\nthe Jews despair of escaping, excited them to act more boldly; for\r\nnothing makes men fight so desperately in war as necessity.\r\n\r\n5. Now when the next day an assault was made by the Romans, the Jews at\r\nfirst staid out of the walls and opposed them, and met them, as having\r\nformed themselves a camp before the city walls. But when Vespasian had\r\nset against them the archers and slingers, and the whole multitude that\r\ncould throw to a great distance, he permitted them to go to work, while\r\nhe himself, with the footmen, got upon an acclivity, whence the city\r\nmight easily be taken. Josephus was then in fear for the city, and\r\nleaped out, and all the Jewish multitude with him; these fell together\r\nupon the Romans in great numbers, and drove them away from the wall, and\r\nperformed a great many glorious and bold actions. Yet did they suffer\r\nas much as they made the enemy suffer; for as despair of deliverance\r\nencouraged the Jews, so did a sense of shame equally encourage the\r\nRomans. These last had skill as well as strength; the other had only\r\ncourage, which armed them, and made them fight furiously. And when the\r\nfight had lasted all day, it was put an end to by the coming on of the\r\nnight. They had wounded a great many of the Romans, and killed of them\r\nthirteen men; of the Jews' side seventeen were slain, and six hundred\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n6. On the next day the Jews made another attack upon the Romans, and\r\nwent out of the walls and fought a much more desperate battle with them\r\nthan before. For they were now become more courageous than formerly, and\r\nthat on account of the unexpected good opposition they had made the day\r\nbefore, as they found the Romans also to fight more desperately; for a\r\nsense of shame inflamed these into a passion, as esteeming their failure\r\nof a sudden victory to be a kind of defeat. Thus did the Romans try to\r\nmake an impression upon the Jews till the fifth day continually, while\r\nthe people of Jotapata made sallies out, and fought at the walls most\r\ndesperately; nor were the Jews affrighted at the strength of the enemy,\r\nnor were the Romans discouraged at the difficulties they met with in\r\ntaking the city.\r\n\r\n7. Now Jotapata is almost all of it built on a precipice, having on\r\nall the other sides of it every way valleys immensely deep and steep,\r\ninsomuch that those who would look down would have their sight fail them\r\nbefore it reaches to the bottom. It is only to be come at on the north\r\nside, where the utmost part of the city is built on the mountain, as it\r\nends obliquely at a plain. This mountain Josephus had encompassed with\r\na wall when he fortified the city, that its top might not be capable\r\nof being seized upon by the enemies. The city is covered all round with\r\nother mountains, and can no way be seen till a man comes just upon it.\r\nAnd this was the strong situation of Jotapata.\r\n\r\n8. Vespasian, therefore, in order to try how he might overcome the\r\nnatural strength of the place, as well as the bold defense of the Jews,\r\nmade a resolution to prosecute the siege with vigor. To that end he\r\ncalled the commanders that were under him to a council of war, and\r\nconsulted with them which way the assault might be managed to the best\r\nadvantage. And when the resolution was there taken to raise a bank\r\nagainst that part of the wall which was practicable, he sent his whole\r\narmy abroad to get the materials together. So when they had cut down\r\nall the trees on the mountains that adjoined to the city, and had gotten\r\ntogether a vast heap of stones, besides the wood they had cut down, some\r\nof them brought hurdles, in order to avoid the effects of the darts that\r\nwere shot from above them. These hurdles they spread over their banks,\r\nunder cover whereof they formed their bank, and so were little or\r\nnothing hurt by the darts that were thrown upon them from the wall,\r\nwhile others pulled the neighboring hillocks to pieces, and perpetually\r\nbrought earth to them; so that while they were busy three sorts of ways,\r\nnobody was idle. However, the Jews cast great stones from the walls upon\r\nthe hurdles which protected the men, with all sorts of darts also; and\r\nthe noise of what could not reach them was yet so terrible, that it was\r\nsome impediment to the workmen.\r\n\r\n9. Vespasian then set the engines for throwing stones and darts round\r\nabout the city. The number of the engines was in all a hundred and\r\nsixty, and bid them fall to work, and dislodge those that were upon the\r\nwall. At the same time such engines as were intended for that purpose\r\nthrew at once lances upon them with a great noise, and stones of the\r\nweight of a talent were thrown by the engines that were prepared for\r\nthat purpose, together with fire, and a vast multitude of arrows, which\r\nmade the wall so dangerous, that the Jews durst not only not come\r\nupon it, but durst not come to those parts within the walls which were\r\nreached by the engines; for the multitude of the Arabian archers, as\r\nwell also as all those that threw darts and slung stones, fell to work\r\nat the same time with the engines. Yet did not the others lie still,\r\nwhen they could not throw at the Romans from a higher place; for they\r\nthen made sallies out of the city, like private robbers, by parties, and\r\npulled away the hurdles that covered the workmen, and killed them when\r\nthey were thus naked; and when those workmen gave way, these cast away\r\nthe earth that composed the bank, and burnt the wooden parts of it,\r\ntogether with the hurdles, till at length Vespasian perceived that the\r\nintervals there were between the works were of disadvantage to him;\r\nfor those spaces of ground afforded the Jews a place for assaulting the\r\nRomans. So he united the hurdles, and at the same time joined one part\r\nof the army to the other, which prevented the private excursions of the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n10. And when the bank was now raised, and brought nearer than ever to\r\nthe battlements that belonged to the walls, Josephus thought it would be\r\nentirely wrong in him if he could make no contrivances in opposition\r\nto theirs, and that might be for the city's preservation; so he got\r\ntogether his workmen, and ordered them to build the wall higher; and\r\nwhile they said that this was impossible to be done while so many darts\r\nwere thrown at them, he invented this sort of cover for them: He bid\r\nthem fix piles, and expand before them the raw hides of oxen newly\r\nkilled, that these hides by yielding and hollowing themselves when the\r\nstones were thrown at them might receive them, for that the other darts\r\nwould slide off them, and the fire that was thrown would be quenched by\r\nthe moisture that was in them. And these he set before the workmen, and\r\nunder them these workmen went on with their works in safety, and raised\r\nthe wall higher, and that both by day and by night, till it was twenty\r\ncubits high. He also built a good number of towers upon the wall, and\r\nfitted it to strong battlements. This greatly discouraged the Romans,\r\nwho in their own opinions were already gotten within the walls, while\r\nthey were now at once astonished at Josephus's contrivance, and at the\r\nfortitude of the citizens that were in the city.\r\n\r\n11. And now Vespasian was plainly irritated at the great subtlety of\r\nthis stratagem, and at the boldness of the citizens of Jotapata; for\r\ntaking heart again upon the building of this wall, they made fresh\r\nsallies upon the Romans, and had every day conflicts with them by\r\nparties, together with all such contrivances, as robbers make use of,\r\nand with the plundering of all that came to hand, as also with the\r\nsetting fire to all the other works; and this till Vespasian made his\r\narmy leave off fighting them, and resolved to lie round the city, and\r\nto starve them into a surrender, as supposing that either they would\r\nbe forced to petition him for mercy by want of provisions, or if they\r\nshould have the courage to hold out till the last, they should perish\r\nby famine: and he concluded he should conquer them the more easily in\r\nfighting, if he gave them an interval, and then fell upon them when they\r\nwere weakened by famine; but still he gave orders that they should guard\r\nagainst their coming out of the city.\r\n\r\n12. Now the besieged had plenty of corn within the city, and indeed of\r\nall necessaries, but they wanted water, because there was no fountain in\r\nthe city, the people being there usually satisfied with rain water; yet\r\nis it a rare thing in that country to have rain in summer, and at\r\nthis season, during the siege, they were in great distress for some\r\ncontrivance to satisfy their thirst; and they were very sad at this time\r\nparticularly, as if they were already in want of water entirely, for\r\nJosephus seeing that the city abounded with other necessaries, and that\r\nthe men were of good courage, and being desirous to protract the siege\r\nto the Romans longer than they expected, ordered their drink to be given\r\nthem by measure; but this scanty distribution of water by measure was\r\ndeemed by them as a thing more hard upon them than the want of it;\r\nand their not being able to drink as much as they would made them more\r\ndesirous of drinking than they otherwise had been; nay, they were as\r\nmuch disheartened hereby as if they were come to the last degree of\r\nthirst. Nor were the Romans unacquainted with the state they were in,\r\nfor when they stood over against them, beyond the wall, they could see\r\nthem running together, and taking their water by measure, which made\r\nthem throw their javelins thither the place being within their reach,\r\nand kill a great many of them.\r\n\r\n13. Hereupon Vespasian hoped that their receptacles of water would in\r\nno long time be emptied, and that they would be forced to deliver up\r\nthe city to him; but Josephus being minded to break such his hope, gave\r\ncommand that they should wet a great many of their clothes, and hang\r\nthem out about the battlements, till the entire wall was of a sudden all\r\nwet with the running down of the water. At this sight the Romans were\r\ndiscouraged, and under consternation, when they saw them able to throw\r\naway in sport so much water, when they supposed them not to have enough\r\nto drink themselves. This made the Roman general despair of taking the\r\ncity by their want of necessaries, and to betake himself again to arms,\r\nand to try to force them to surrender, which was what the Jews greatly\r\ndesired; for as they despaired of either themselves or their city being\r\nable to escape, they preferred a death in battle before one by hunger\r\nand thirst.\r\n\r\n14. However, Josephus contrived another stratagem besides the foregoing,\r\nto get plenty of what they wanted. There was a certain rough and uneven\r\nplace that could hardly be ascended, and on that account was not guarded\r\nby the soldiers; so Josephus sent out certain persons along the western\r\nparts of the valley, and by them sent letters to whom he pleased of the\r\nJews that were out of the city, and procured from them what necessaries\r\nsoever they wanted in the city in abundance; he enjoined them also to\r\ncreep generally along by the watch as they came into the city, and to\r\ncover their backs with such sheep-skins as had their wool upon them,\r\nthat if any one should spy them out in the night time, they might\r\nbe believed to be dogs. This was done till the watch perceived their\r\ncontrivance, and encompassed that rough place about themselves.\r\n\r\n15. And now it was that Josephus perceived that the city could not hold\r\nout long, and that his own life would be in doubt if he continued in it;\r\nso he consulted how he and the most potent men of the city might fly\r\nout of it. When the multitude understood this, they came all round about\r\nhim, and begged of him not to overlook them while they entirely depended\r\non him, and him alone; for that there was still hope of the city's\r\ndeliverance, if he would stay with them, because every body would\r\nundertake any pains with great cheerfulness on his account, and in that\r\ncase there would be some comfort for them also, though they should be\r\ntaken: that it became him neither to fly from his enemies, nor to desert\r\nhis friends, nor to leap out of that city, as out of a ship that was\r\nsinking in a storm, into which he came when it was quiet and in a calm;\r\nfor that by going away he would be the cause of drowning the city,\r\nbecause nobody would then venture to oppose the enemy when he was once\r\ngone, upon whom they wholly confided. 16. Hereupon Josephus avoided\r\nletting them know that he was to go away to provide for his own safety,\r\nbut told them that he would go out of the city for their sakes; for that\r\nif he staid with them, he should be able to do them little good while\r\nthey were in a safe condition; and that if they were once taken, he\r\nshould only perish with them to no purpose; but that if he were once\r\ngotten free from this siege, he should be able to bring them very great\r\nrelief; for that he would then immediately get the Galileans together,\r\nout of the country, in great multitudes, and draw the Romans off their\r\ncity by another war. That he did not see what advantage he could bring\r\nto them now, by staying among them, but only provoke the Romans to\r\nbesiege them more closely, as esteeming it a most valuable thing to take\r\nhim; but that if they were once informed that he was fled out of the\r\ncity, they would greatly remit of their eagerness against it. Yet did\r\nnot this plea move the people, but inflamed them the more to hang about\r\nhim. Accordingly, both the children and the old men, and the women with\r\ntheir infants, came mourning to him, and fell down before him, and all\r\nof them caught hold of his feet, and held him fast, and besought him,\r\nwith great lamentations, that he would take his share with them in\r\ntheir fortune; and I think they did this, not that they envied his\r\ndeliverance, but that they hoped for their own; for they could not think\r\nthey should suffer any great misfortune, provided Josephus would but\r\nstay with them.\r\n\r\n17. Now Josephus thought, that if he resolved to stay, it would be\r\nascribed to their entreaties; and if he resolved to go away by force, he\r\nshould be put into custody. His commiseration also of the people under\r\ntheir lamentations had much broken that his eagerness to leave them; so\r\nhe resolved to stay, and arming himself with the common despair of\r\nthe citizens, he said to them, \"Now is the time to begin to fight in\r\nearnest, when there is no hope of deliverance left. It is a brave\r\nthing to prefer glory before life, and to set about some such noble\r\nundertaking as may be remembered by late posterity.\" Having said\r\nthis, he fell to work immediately, and made a sally, and dispersed the\r\nenemies' out-guards, and ran as far as the Roman camp itself, and pulled\r\nthe coverings of their tents to pieces, that were upon their banks, and\r\nset fire to their works. And this was the manner in which he never left\r\noff fighting, neither the next day, nor the day after it, but went on\r\nwith it for a considerable number of both days and nights.\r\n\r\n18. Upon this, Vespasian, when he saw the Romans distressed by these\r\nsallies, [though they were ashamed to be made to run away by the Jews;\r\nand when at any time they made the Jews run away, their heavy armor\r\nwould not let them pursue them far; while the Jews, when they had\r\nperformed any action, and before they could be hurt themselves, still\r\nretired into the city,] ordered his armed men to avoid their onset,\r\nand not fight it out with men under desperation, while nothing is more\r\ncourageous than despair; but that their violence would be quenched when\r\nthey saw they failed of their purposes, as fire is quenched when\r\nit wants fuel; and that it was proper for the Romans to gain their\r\nvictories as cheap as they could, since they are not forced to fight,\r\nbut only to enlarge their own dominions. So he repelled the Jews in\r\ngreat measure by the Arabian archers, and the Syrian slingers, and by\r\nthose that threw stones at them, nor was there any intermission of the\r\ngreat number of their offensive engines. Now the Jews suffered greatly\r\nby these engines, without being able to escape from them; and when these\r\nengines threw their stones or javelins a great way, and the Jews were\r\nwithin their reach, they pressed hard upon the Romans, and fought\r\ndesperately, without sparing either soul or body, one part succoring\r\nanother by turns, when it was tired down.\r\n\r\n19. When, therefore, Vespasian looked upon himself as in a manner\r\nbesieged by these sallies of the Jews, and when his banks were now not\r\nfar from the walls, he determined to make use of his battering ram.\r\nThis battering ram is a vast beam of wood like the mast of a ship, its\r\nforepart is armed with a thick piece of iron at the head of it, which\r\nis so carved as to be like the head of a ram, whence its name is taken.\r\nThis ram is slung in the air by ropes passing over its middle, and is\r\nhung like the balance in a pair of scales from another beam, and braced\r\nby strong beams that pass on both sides of it, in the nature of a cross.\r\nWhen this ram is pulled backward by a great number of men with united\r\nforce, and then thrust forward by the same men, with a mighty noise, it\r\nbatters the walls with that iron part which is prominent. Nor is there\r\nany tower so strong, or walls so broad, that can resist any more than\r\nits first batteries, but all are forced to yield to it at last. This was\r\nthe experiment which the Roman general betook himself to, when he was\r\neagerly bent upon taking the city; but found lying in the field so\r\nlong to be to his disadvantage, because the Jews would never let him be\r\nquiet. So these Romans brought the several engines for galling an enemy\r\nnearer to the walls, that they might reach such as were upon the wall,\r\nand endeavored to frustrate their attempts; these threw stones and\r\njavelins at them; in the like manner did the archers and slingers come\r\nboth together closer to the wall. This brought matters to such a pass\r\nthat none of the Jews durst mount the walls, and then it was that the\r\nother Romans brought the battering ram that was cased with hurdles all\r\nover, and in the tipper part was secured by skins that covered it, and\r\nthis both for the security of themselves and of the engine. Now, at the\r\nvery first stroke of this engine, the wall was shaken, and a terrible\r\nclamor was raised by the people within the city, as if they were already\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n20. And now, when Josephus saw this ram still battering the same place,\r\nand that the wall would quickly be thrown down by it, he resolved to\r\nelude for a while the force of the engine. With this design he gave\r\norders to fill sacks with chaff, and to hang them down before that place\r\nwhere they saw the ram always battering, that the stroke might be turned\r\naside, or that the place might feel less of the strokes by the yielding\r\nnature of the chaff. This contrivance very much delayed the attempts\r\nof the Romans, because, let them remove their engine to what part they\r\npleased, those that were above it removed their sacks, and placed them\r\nover against the strokes it made, insomuch that the wall was no way\r\nhurt, and this by diversion of the strokes, till the Romans made an\r\nopposite contrivance of long poles, and by tying hooks at their ends,\r\ncut off the sacks. Now when the battering ram thus recovered its force,\r\nand the wall having been but newly built, was giving way, Josephus and\r\nthose about him had afterward immediate recourse to fire, to defend\r\nthemselves withal; whereupon they took what materials soever they had\r\nthat were but dry, and made a sally three ways, and set fire to the\r\nmachines, and the hurdles, and the banks of the Romans themselves; nor\r\ndid the Romans well know how to come to their assistance, being at once\r\nunder a consternation at the Jews' boldness, and being prevented by the\r\nflames from coming to their assistance; for the materials being dry with\r\nthe bitumen and pitch that were among them, as was brimstone also, the\r\nfire caught hold of every thing immediately, and what cost the Romans a\r\ngreat deal of pains was in one hour consumed.\r\n\r\n21. And here a certain Jew appeared worthy of our relation and\r\ncommendation; he was the son of Sameas, and was called Eleazar, and was\r\nborn at Saab, in Galilee. This man took up a stone of a vast bigness,\r\nand threw it down from the wall upon the ram, and this with so great a\r\nforce, that it broke off the head of the engine. He also leaped down,\r\nand took up the head of the ram from the midst of them, and without any\r\nconcern carried it to the top of the wall, and this while he stood as a\r\nfit mark to be pelted by all his enemies. Accordingly, he received the\r\nstrokes upon his naked body, and was wounded with five darts; nor did he\r\nmind any of them while he went up to the top of the wall, where he stood\r\nin the sight of them all, as an instance of the greatest boldness; after\r\nwhich he drew himself on a heap with his wounds upon him, and fell down\r\ntogether with the head of the ram. Next to him, two brothers showed\r\ntheir courage; their names were Netir and Philip, both of them of the\r\nvillage Ruma, and both of them Galileans also; these men leaped upon the\r\nsoldiers of the tenth legion, and fell upon the Romans with such a noise\r\nand force as to disorder their ranks, and to put to flight all upon\r\nwhomsoever they made their assaults.\r\n\r\n22. After these men's performances, Josephus, and the rest of the\r\nmultitude with him, took a great deal of fire, and burnt both the\r\nmachines and their coverings, with the works belonging to the fifth and\r\nto the tenth legion, which they put to flight; when others followed them\r\nimmediately, and buried those instruments and all their materials under\r\nground. However, about the evening, the Romans erected the battering ram\r\nagain, against that part of the wall which had suffered before; where a\r\ncertain Jew that defended the city from the Romans hit Vespasian with a\r\ndart in his foot, and wounded him a little, the distance being so great,\r\nthat no mighty impression could be made by the dart thrown so far off.\r\nHowever, this caused the greatest disorder among the Romans; for when\r\nthose who stood near him saw his blood, they were disturbed at it, and\r\na report went abroad, through the whole army, that the general was\r\nwounded, while the greatest part left the siege, and came running\r\ntogether with surprise and fear to the general; and before them all\r\ncame Titus, out of the concern he had for his father, insomuch that the\r\nmultitude were in great confusion, and this out of the regard they had\r\nfor their general, and by reason of the agony that the son was in. Yet\r\ndid the father soon put an end to the son's fear, and to the disorder\r\nthe army was under, for being superior to his pains, and endeavoring\r\nsoon to be seen by all that had been in a fright about him, he excited\r\nthem to fight the Jews more briskly; for now every body was willing to\r\nexpose himself to danger immediately, in order to avenge their general;\r\nand then they encouraged one another with loud voices, and ran hastily\r\nto the walls.\r\n\r\n23. But still Josephus and those with him, although they fell down dead\r\none upon another by the darts and stones which the engines threw upon\r\nthem, yet did not they desert the wall, but fell upon those who managed\r\nthe ram, under the protection of the hurdles, with fire, and iron\r\nweapons, and stones; and these could do little or nothing, but fell\r\nthemselves perpetually, while they were seen by those whom they could\r\nnot see, for the light of their own flame shone about them, and made\r\nthem a most visible mark to the enemy, as they were in the day time,\r\nwhile the engines could not be seen at a great distance, and so what was\r\nthrown at them was hard to be avoided; for the force with which these\r\nengines threw stones and darts made them hurt several at a time, and the\r\nviolent noise of the stones that were cast by the engines was so great,\r\nthat they carried away the pinnacles of the wall, and broke off the\r\ncorners of the towers; for no body of men could be so strong as not to\r\nbe overthrown to the last rank by the largeness of the stones. And any\r\none may learn the force of the engines by what happened this very night;\r\nfor as one of those that stood round about Josephus was near the wall,\r\nhis head was carried away by such a stone, and his skull was flung as\r\nfar as three furlongs. In the day time also, a woman with child had her\r\nbelly so violently struck, as she was just come out of her house, that\r\nthe infant was carried to the distance of half a furlong, so great was\r\nthe force of that engine. The noise of the instruments themselves was\r\nvery terrible, the sound of the darts and stones that were thrown by\r\nthem was so also; of the same sort was that noise the dead bodies made,\r\nwhen they were dashed against the wall; and indeed dreadful was the\r\nclamor which these things raised in the women within the city, which was\r\nechoed back at the same time by the cries of such as were slain; while\r\nthe whole space of ground whereon they fought ran with blood, and the\r\nwall might have been ascended over by the bodies of the dead carcasses;\r\nthe mountains also contributed to increase the noise by their echoes;\r\nnor was there on that night any thing of terror wanting that could\r\neither affect the hearing or the sight: yet did a great part of those\r\nthat fought so hard for Jotapata fall manfully, as were a great part of\r\nthem wounded. However, the morning watch was come ere the wall yielded\r\nto the machines employed against it, though it had been battered without\r\nintermission. However, those within covered their bodies with their\r\narmor, and raised works over against that part which was thrown down,\r\nbefore those machines were laid by which the Romans were to ascend into\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n24. In the morning Vespasian got his army together, in order to take the\r\ncity [by storm], after a little recreation upon the hard pains they had\r\nbeen at the night before; and as he was desirous to draw off those that\r\nopposed him from the places where the wall had been thrown down, he made\r\nthe most courageous of the horsemen get off their horses, and placed\r\nthem in three ranks over against those ruins of the wall, but covered\r\nwith their armor on every side, and with poles in their hands, that\r\nso these might begin their ascent as soon as the instruments for such\r\nascent were laid; behind them he placed the flower of the footmen; but\r\nfor the rest of the horse, he ordered them to extend themselves over\r\nagainst the wall, upon the whole hilly country, in order to prevent any\r\nfrom escaping out of the city when it should be taken; and behind these\r\nhe placed the archers round about, and commanded them to have their\r\ndarts ready to shoot. The same command he gave to the slingers, and to\r\nthose that managed the engines, and bid them to take up other ladders,\r\nand have them ready to lay upon those parts of the wall which were yet\r\nuntouched, that the besieged might be engaged in trying to hinder their\r\nascent by them, and leave the guard of the parts that were thrown down,\r\nwhile the rest of them should be overborne by the darts cast at them,\r\nand might afford his men an entrance into the city.\r\n\r\n25. But Josephus, understanding the meaning of Vespasian's contrivance,\r\nset the old men, together with those that were tired out, at the sound\r\nparts of the wall, as expecting no harm from those quarters, but set the\r\nstrongest of his men at the place where the wall was broken down, and\r\nbefore them all six men by themselves, among whom he took his share\r\nof the first and greatest danger. He also gave orders, that when the\r\nlegions made a shout, they should stop their ears, that they might not\r\nbe affrighted at it, and that, to avoid the multitude of the enemy's\r\ndarts, they should bend down on their knees, and cover themselves with\r\ntheir shields, and that they should retreat a little backward for a\r\nwhile, till the archers should have emptied their quivers; but that When\r\nthe Romans should lay their instruments for ascending the walls, they\r\nshould leap out on the sudden, and with their own instruments should\r\nmeet the enemy, and that every one should strive to do his best,\r\nin order not to defend his own city, as if it were possible to be\r\npreserved, but in order to revenge it, when it was already destroyed;\r\nand that they should set before their eyes how their old men were to be\r\nslain, and their children and wives were to be killed immediately by the\r\nenemy; and that they would beforehand spend all their fury, on account\r\nof the calamities just coming upon them, and pour it out on the actors.\r\n\r\n26. And thus did Josephus dispose of both his bodies of men; but then\r\nfor the useless part of the citizens, the women and children, when they\r\nsaw their city encompassed by a threefold army, [for none of the usual\r\nguards that had been fighting before were removed,] when they also saw,\r\nnot only the walls thrown down, but their enemies with swords in their\r\nhands, as also the hilly country above them shining with their weapons,\r\nand the darts in the hands of the Arabian archers, they made a final\r\nand lamentable outcry of the destruction, as if the misery were not only\r\nthreatened, but actually come upon them already. But Josephus ordered\r\nthe women to be shut up in their houses, lest they should render the\r\nwarlike actions of the men too effeminate, by making them commiserate\r\ntheir condition, and commanded them to hold their peace, and threatened\r\nthem if they did not, while he came himself before the breach, where his\r\nallotment was; for all those who brought ladders to the other places,\r\nhe took no notice of them, but earnestly waited for the shower of arrows\r\nthat was coming.\r\n\r\n27. And now the trumpetersAnd now the trumpeters of the several Roman legions sounded\r\ntogether, and the army made a terrible shout; and the darts, as\r\nby order, flew so fast, that they intercepted the light. However,\r\nJosephus's men remembered the charges he had given them, they stopped\r\ntheir ears at the sounds, and covered their bodies against the darts;\r\nand as to the engines that were set ready to go to work, the Jews ran\r\nout upon them, before those that should have used them were gotten\r\nupon them. And now, on the ascending of the soldiers, there was a great\r\nconflict, and many actions of the hands and of the soul were exhibited;\r\nwhile the Jews did earnestly endeavor, in the extreme danger they were\r\nin, not to show less courage than those who, without being in danger,\r\nfought so stoutly against them; nor did they leave struggling with\r\nthe Romans till they either fell down dead themselves, or killed\r\ntheir antagonists. But the Jews grew weary with defending themselves\r\ncontinually, and had not enough to come in their places, and succor\r\nthem; while, on the side of the Romans, fresh men still succeeded\r\nthose that were tired; and still new men soon got upon the machines for\r\nascent, in the room of those that were thrust down; those encouraging\r\none another, and joining side to side with their shields, which were a\r\nprotection to them, they became a body of men not to be broken; and as\r\nthis band thrust away the Jews, as though they were themselves but one\r\nbody, they began already to get upon the wall.\r\n\r\n28. Then did Josephus take necessity for his counselor in this utmost\r\ndistress, [which necessity is very sagacious in invention when it is\r\nirritated by despair,] and gave orders to pour scalding oil upon those\r\nwhose shields protected them. Whereupon they soon got it ready, being\r\nmany that brought it, and what they brought being a great quantity also,\r\nand poured it on all sides upon the Romans, and threw down upon them\r\ntheir vessels as they were still hissing from the heat of the fire: this\r\nso burnt the Romans, that it dispersed that united band, who now tumbled\r\nclown from the wall with horrid pains, for the oil did easily run down\r\nthe whole body from head to foot, under their entire armor, and fed upon\r\ntheir flesh like flame itself, its fat and unctuous nature rendering it\r\nsoon heated and slowly cooled; and as the men were cooped up in their\r\nhead-pieces and breastplates, they could no way get free from this\r\nburning oil; they could only leap and roll about in their pains, as they\r\nfell down from the bridges they had laid. And as they thus were beaten\r\nback, and retired to their own party, who still pressed them forward,\r\nthey were easily wounded by those that were behind them.\r\n\r\n29. However, in this ill success of the Romans, their courage did\r\nnot fail them, nor did the Jews want prudence to oppose them; for the\r\nRomans, although they saw their own men thrown down, and in a miserable\r\ncondition, yet were they vehemently bent against those that poured\r\nthe oil upon them; while every one reproached the man before him as a\r\ncoward, and one that hindered him from exerting himself; and while the\r\nJews made use of another stratagem to prevent their ascent, and poured\r\nboiling fenugreek upon the boards, in order to make them slip and fall\r\ndown; by which means neither could those that were coming up, nor\r\nthose that were going down, stand on their feet; but some of them fell\r\nbackward upon the machines on which they ascended, and were trodden\r\nupon; many of them fell down upon the bank they had raised, and when\r\nthey were fallen upon it were slain by the Jews; for when the Romans\r\ncould not keep their feet, the Jews being freed from fighting hand to\r\nhand, had leisure to throw their darts at them. So the general called\r\noff those soldiers in the evening that had suffered so sorely, of whom\r\nthe number of the slain was not a few, while that of the wounded was\r\nstill greater; but of the people of Jotapata no more than six men were\r\nkilled, although more than three hundred were carried off wounded. This\r\nfight happened on the twentieth day of the month Desius [Sivan]. 30.\r\nHereupon Vespasian comforted his army on occasion of what happened, and\r\nas he found them angry indeed, but rather wanting somewhat to do than\r\nany further exhortations, he gave orders to raise the banks still\r\nhigher, and to erect three towers, each fifty feet high, and that they\r\nshould cover them with plates of iron on every side, that they might\r\nbe both firm by their weight, and not easily liable to be set on fire.\r\nThese towers he set upon the banks, and placed upon them such as could\r\nshoot darts and arrows, with the lighter engines for throwing stones and\r\ndarts also; and besides these, he set upon them the stoutest men among\r\nthe slingers, who not being to be seen by reason of the height they\r\nstood upon, and the battlements that protected them, might throw their\r\nweapons at those that were upon the wall, and were easily seen by them.\r\nHereupon the Jews, not being easily able to escape those darts that were\r\nthrown down upon their heads, nor to avenge themselves on those whom\r\nthey could not see, and perceiving that the height of the towers was so\r\ngreat, that a dart which they threw with their hand could hardly reach\r\nit, and that the iron plates about them made it very hard to come at\r\nthem by fire, they ran away from the walls, and fled hastily out of the\r\ncity, and fell upon those that shot at them. And thus did the people of\r\nJotapata resist the Romans, while a great number of them were every day\r\nkilled, without their being able to retort the evil upon their enemies;\r\nnor could they keep them out of the city without danger to themselves.\r\n\r\n31. About this time it was that Vespasian sent out Trajan against a city\r\ncalled Japha, that lay near to Jotapata, and that desired innovations,\r\nand was puffed up with the unexpected length of the opposition of\r\nJotapata. This Trajan was the commander of the tenth legion, and to him\r\nVespasian committed one thousand horsemen, and two thousand footmen.\r\nWhen Trajan came to the city, he found it hard to be taken, for besides\r\nthe natural strength of its situation, it was also secured by a double\r\nwall; but when he saw the people of this city coming out of it, and\r\nready to fight him, he joined battle with them, and after a short\r\nresistance which they made, he pursued after them; and as they fled to\r\ntheir first wall, the Romans followed them so closely, that they fell\r\nin together with them: but when the Jews were endeavoring to get again\r\nwithin their second wall, their fellow citizens shut them out, as being\r\nafraid that the Romans would force themselves in with them. It was\r\ncertainly God therefore who brought the Romans to punish the Galileans,\r\nand did then expose the people of the city every one of them manifestly\r\nto be destroyed by their bloody enemies; for they fell upon the gates in\r\ngreat crowds, and earnestly calling to those that kept them, and that\r\nby their names also, yet had they their throats cut in the very midst of\r\ntheir supplications; for the enemy shut the gates of the first wall, and\r\ntheir own citizens shut the gates of the second, so they were enclosed\r\nbetween two walls, and were slain in great numbers together; many of\r\nthem were run through by swords of their own men, and many by their own\r\nswords, besides an immense number that were slain by the Romans. Nor\r\nhad they any courage to revenge themselves; for there was added to the\r\nconsternation they were in from the enemy, their being betrayed by their\r\nown friends, which quite broke their spirits; and at last they died,\r\ncursing not the Romans, but their own citizens, till they were all\r\ndestroyed, being in number twelve thousand. So Trajan gathered that the\r\ncity was empty of people that could fight, and although there should a\r\nfew of them be therein, he supposed that they would be too timorous to\r\nventure upon any opposition; so he reserved the taking of the city to\r\nthe general. Accordingly, he sent messengers to Vespasian, and desired\r\nhim to send his son Titus to finish the victory he had gained. Vespasian\r\nhereupon imagining there might be some pains still necessary, sent his\r\nson with an army of five hundred horsemen, and one thousand footmen. So\r\nhe came quickly to the city, and put his army in order, and set Trajan\r\nover the left wing, while he had the right himself, and led them to the\r\nsiege: and when the soldiers brought ladders to be laid against the wall\r\non every side, the Galileans opposed them from above for a while; but\r\nsoon afterward they left the walls. Then did Titus's men leap into the\r\ncity, and seized upon it presently; but when those that were in it were\r\ngotten together, there was a fierce battle between them; for the men of\r\npower fell upon the Romans in the narrow streets, and the women threw\r\nwhatsoever came next to hand at them, and sustained a fight with them\r\nfor six hours' time; but when the fighting men were spent, the rest of\r\nthe multitude had their throats cut, partly in the open air, and partly\r\nin their own houses, both young and old together. So there were no males\r\nnow remaining, besides infants, which, with the women, were carried as\r\nslaves into captivity; so that the number of the slain, both now in the\r\ncity and at the former fight, was fifteen thousand, and the captives\r\nwere two thousand one hundred and thirty. This calamity befell the\r\nGalileans on the twenty-fifth day of the month Desius [Sivan.] 32. Nor\r\ndid the Samaritans escape their share of misfortunes at this time; for\r\nthey assembled themselves together upon the mountain called Gerizzim,\r\nwhich is with them a holy mountain, and there they remained; which\r\ncollection of theirs, as well as the courageous minds they showed, could\r\nnot but threaten somewhat of war; nor were they rendered wiser by\r\nthe miseries that had come upon their neighboring cities. They also,\r\nnotwithstanding the great success the Romans had, marched on in an\r\nunreasonable manner, depending on their own weakness, and were disposed\r\nfor any tumult upon its first appearance. Vespasian therefore thought\r\nit best to prevent their motions, and to cut off the foundation of their\r\nattempts. For although all Samaria had ever garrisons settled among\r\nthem, yet did the number of those that were come to Mount Gerizzim, and\r\ntheir conspiracy together, give ground for fear what they would be at;\r\nhe therefore sent thither Cerealis, the commander of the fifth legion,\r\nwith six hundred horsemen, and three thousand footmen, who did not think\r\nit safe to go up to the mountain, and give them battle, because many of\r\nthe enemy were on the higher part of the ground; so he encompassed all\r\nthe lower part of the mountain with his army, and watched them all that\r\nday. Now it happened that the Samaritans, who were now destitute of\r\nwater, were inflamed with a violent heat, [for it was summer time, and\r\nthe multitude had not provided themselves with necessaries,] insomuch\r\nthat some of them died that very day with heat, while others of them\r\npreferred slavery before such a death as that was, and fled to the\r\nRomans; by whom Cerealis understood that those which still staid\r\nthere were very much broken by their misfortunes. So he went up to the\r\nmountain, and having placed his forces round about the enemy, he, in the\r\nfirst place, exhorted them to take the security of his right hand, and\r\ncome to terms with him, and thereby save themselves; and assured them,\r\nthat if they would lay down their arms, he would secure them from any\r\nharm; but when he could not prevail with them, he fell upon them and\r\nslew them all, being in number eleven thousand and six hundred. This was\r\ndone on the twenty-seventh day of the month Desius [Sivan]. And these\r\nwere the calamities that befell the Samaritans at this time.\r\n\r\n33. But as the people of Jotapata still held out manfully, and bore\r\nup under their miseries beyond all that could be hoped for, on the\r\nforty-seventh day [of the siege] the banks cast up by the Romans were\r\nbecome higher than the wall; on which day a certain deserter went to\r\nVespasian, and told him how few were left in the city, and how weak they\r\nwere, and that they had been so worn out with perpetual watching, and as\r\nperpetual fighting, that they could not now oppose any force that came\r\nagainst them, and that they might be taken by stratagem, if any one\r\nwould attack them; for that about the last watch of the night, when they\r\nthought they might have some rest from the hardships they were under,\r\nand when a morning sleep used to come upon them, as they were thoroughly\r\nweary, he said the watch used to fall asleep; accordingly his advice\r\nwas, that they should make their attack at that hour. But Vespasian had\r\na suspicion about this deserter, as knowing how faithful the Jews were\r\nto one another, and how much they despised any punishments that could be\r\ninflicted on them; this last because one of the people of Jotapata had\r\nundergone all sorts of torments, and though they made him pass through a\r\nfiery trial of his enemies in his examination, yet would he inform them\r\nnothing of the affairs within the city, and as he was crucified, smiled\r\nat them. However, the probability there was in the relation itself\r\ndid partly confirm the truth of what the deserter told them, and they\r\nthought he might probably speak truth. However, Vespasian thought they\r\nshould be no great sufferers if the report was a sham; so he commanded\r\nthem to keep the man in custody, and prepared the army for taking the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n34. According to which resolution they marched without noise, at the\r\nhour that had been told them, to the wall; and it was Titus himself that\r\nfirst got upon it, with one of his tribunes, Domitius Sabinus, and had\r\na few of the fifteenth legion along with him. So they cut the throats of\r\nthe watch, and entered the city very quietly. After these came Cerealis\r\nthe tribune, and Placidus, and led on those that were tinder them. Now\r\nwhen the citadel was taken, and the enemy were in the very midst of the\r\ncity, and when it was already day, yet was not the taking of the city\r\nknown by those that held it; for a great many of them were fast asleep,\r\nand a great mist, which then by chance fell upon the city, hindered\r\nthose that got up from distinctly seeing the case they were in, till the\r\nwhole Roman army was gotten in, and they were raised up only to find the\r\nmiseries they were under; and as they were slaying, they perceived the\r\ncity was taken. And for the Romans, they so well remembered what they\r\nhad suffered during the siege, that they spared none, nor pitied any,\r\nbut drove the people down the precipice from the citadel, and slew them\r\nas they drove them down; at which time the difficulties of the place\r\nhindered those that were still able to fight from defending themselves;\r\nfor as they were distressed in the narrow streets, and could not keep\r\ntheir feet sure along the precipice, they were overpowered with the\r\ncrowd of those that came fighting them down from the citadel. This\r\nprovoked a great many, even of those chosen men that were about\r\nJosephus, to kill themselves with their own hands; for when they saw\r\nthat they could kill none of the Romans, they resolved to prevent being\r\nkilled by the Romans, and got together in great numbers in the utmost\r\nparts of the city, and killed themselves.\r\n\r\n35. However, such of the watch as at the first perceived they were\r\ntaken, and ran away as fast as they could, went up into one of\r\nthe towers on the north side of the city, and for a while defended\r\nthemselves there; but as they were encompassed with a multitude of\r\nenemies, they tried to use their right hands when it was too late, and\r\nat length they cheerfully offered their necks to be cut off by those\r\nthat stood over them. And the Romans might have boasted that the\r\nconclusion of that siege was without blood [on their side] if there had\r\nnot been a centurion, Antonius, who was slain at the taking of the city.\r\nHis death was occasioned by the following treachery; for there was one\r\nof those that were fled into the caverns, which were a great number,\r\nwho desired that this Antonius would reach him his right hand for his\r\nsecurity, and would assure him that he would preserve him, and give\r\nhim his assistance in getting up out of the cavern; accordingly, he\r\nincautiously reached him his right hand, when the other man prevented\r\nhim, and stabbed him under his loins with a spear, and killed him\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n36. And on this day it was that the Romans slew all the multitude\r\nthat appeared openly; but on the following days they searched the\r\nhiding-places, and fell upon those that were under ground, and in the\r\ncaverns, and went thus through every age, excepting the infants and\r\nthe women, and of these there were gathered together as captives twelve\r\nhundred; and as for those that were slain at the taking of the city,\r\nand in the former fights, they were numbered to be forty thousand. So\r\nVespasian gave order that the city should be entirely demolished, and\r\nall the fortifications burnt down. And thus was Jotapata taken, in the\r\nthirteenth year of the reign of Nero, on the first day of the month\r\nPanemus [Tamuz].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Josephus Was Discovered By A Woman, And Was Willing To\r\n     Deliver Himself Up To The Romans; And What Discourse He Had\r\n     With His Own Men, When They Endeavored To Hinder Him; And\r\n     What He Said To Vespasian, When He Was Brought To Him; And\r\n     After What Manner Vespasian Used Him Afterward.\r\n\r\n1. And now the Romans searched for Josephus, both out of the hatred they\r\nbore him, and because their general was very desirous to have him taken;\r\nfor he reckoned that if he were once taken, the greatest part of the war\r\nwould be over. They then searched among the dead, and looked into the\r\nmost concealed recesses of the city; but as the city was first taken,\r\nhe was assisted by a certain supernatural providence; for he withdrew\r\nhimself from the enemy when he was in the midst of them, and leaped into\r\na certain deep pit, whereto there adjoined a large den at one side of\r\nit, which den could not be seen by those that were above ground;\r\nand there he met with forty persons of eminency that had concealed\r\nthemselves, and with provisions enough to satisfy them for not a few\r\ndays. So in the day time he hid himself from the enemy, who had seized\r\nupon all places, and in the night time he got up out of the den and\r\nlooked about for some way of escaping, and took exact notice of the\r\nwatch; but as all places were guarded every where on his account, that\r\nthere was no way of getting off unseen, he went down again into the den.\r\nThus he concealed himself two days; but on the third day, when they\r\nhad taken a woman who had been with them, he was discovered. Whereupon\r\nVespasian sent immediately and zealously two tribunes, Paulinus and\r\nGallicanus, and ordered them to give Josephus their right hands as a\r\nsecurity for his life, and to exhort him to come up.\r\n\r\n2. So they came and invited the man to come up, and gave him assurances\r\nthat his life should be preserved: but they did not prevail with him;\r\nfor he gathered suspicions from the probability there was that one who\r\nhad done so many things against the Romans must suffer for it, though\r\nnot from the mild temper of those that invited him. However, he was\r\nafraid that he was invited to come up in order to be punished, until\r\nVespasian sent besides these a third tribune, Nicanor, to him; he\r\nwas one that was well known to Josephus, and had been his familiar\r\nacquaintance in old time. When he was come, he enlarged upon the natural\r\nmildness of the Romans towards those they have once conquered; and told\r\nhim that he had behaved himself so valiantly, that the commanders rather\r\nadmired than hated him; that the general was very desirous to have him\r\nbrought to him, not in order to punish him, for that he could do though\r\nhe should not come voluntarily, but that he was determined to preserve a\r\nman of his courage. He moreover added this, that Vespasian, had he been\r\nresolved to impose upon him, would not have sent to him a friend of his\r\nown, nor put the fairest color upon the vilest action, by pretending\r\nfriendship and meaning perfidiousness; nor would he have himself\r\nacquiesced, or come to him, had it been to deceive him.\r\n\r\n3. Now as Josephus began to hesitate with himself about Nicanor's\r\nproposal, the soldiery were so angry, that they ran hastily to set fire\r\nto the den; but the tribune would not permit them so to do, as being\r\nvery desirous to take the man alive. And now, as Nicanor lay hard at\r\nJosephus to comply, and he understood how the multitude of the enemies\r\nthreatened him, he called to mind the dreams which he had dreamed in the\r\nnight time, whereby God had signified to him beforehand both the\r\nfuture calamities of the Jews, and the events that concerned the Roman\r\nemperors. Now Josephus was able to give shrewd conjectures about the\r\ninterpretation of such dreams as have been ambiguously delivered by God.\r\nMoreover, he was not unacquainted with the prophecies contained in\r\nthe sacred books, as being a priest himself, and of the posterity of\r\npriests: and just then was he in an ecstasy; and setting before him the\r\ntremendous images of the dreams he had lately had, he put up a secret\r\nprayer to God, and said, \"Since it pleaseth thee, who hast created the\r\nJewish nation, to depress the same, and since all their good fortune is\r\ngone over to the Romans, and since thou hast made choice of this soul\r\nof mine to foretell what is to come to pass hereafter, I willingly give\r\nthem my hands, and am content to live. And I protest openly that I do\r\nnot go over to the Romans as a deserter of the Jews, but as a minister\r\nfrom thee.\"\r\n\r\n4. When he had said this, he complied with Nicanor's invitation. But\r\nwhen those Jews who had fled with him understood that he yielded to\r\nthose that invited him to come up, they came about him in a body, and\r\ncried out, \"Nay, indeed, now may the laws of our forefathers, which\r\nGod ordained himself, well groan to purpose; that God we mean who hath\r\ncreated the souls of the Jews of such a temper, that they despise death.\r\nO Josephus! art thou still fond of life? and canst thou bear to see the\r\nlight in a state of slavery? How soon hast thou forgotten thyself! How\r\nmany hast thou persuaded to lose their lives for liberty! Thou\r\nhast therefore had a false reputation for manhood, and a like false\r\nreputation for wisdom, if thou canst hope for preservation from those\r\nagainst whom thou hast fought so zealously, and art however willing\r\nto be preserved by them, if they be in earnest. But although the good\r\nfortune of the Romans hath made thee forget thyself, we ought to take\r\ncare that the glory of our forefathers may not be tarnished. We will\r\nlend thee our right hand and a sword; and if thou wilt die willingly,\r\nthou wilt die as general of the Jews; but if unwillingly, thou wilt die\r\nas a traitor to them.\" As soon as they said this, they began to thrust\r\ntheir swords at him, and threatened they would kill him, if he thought\r\nof yielding himself to the Romans.\r\n\r\n5. Upon this Josephus was afraid of their attacking him, and yet thought\r\nhe should be a betrayer of the commands of God, if he died before they\r\nwere delivered. So he began to talk like a philosopher to them in the\r\ndistress he was then in, when he said thus to them: \"O my friends, why\r\nare we so earnest to kill ourselves? and why do we set our soul and\r\nbody, which are such dear companions, at such variance? Can any one\r\npretend that I am not the man I was formerly? Nay, the Romans are\r\nsensible how that matter stands well enough. It is a brave thing to die\r\nin war; but so that it be according to the law of war, by the hand of\r\nconquerors. If, therefore, I avoid death from the sword of the Romans,\r\nI am truly worthy to be killed by my own sword, and my own hand; but if\r\nthey admit of mercy, and would spare their enemy, how much more ought\r\nwe to have mercy upon ourselves, and to spare ourselves? For it is\r\ncertainly a foolish thing to do that to ourselves which we quarrel with\r\nthem for doing to us. I confess freely that it is a brave thing to die\r\nfor liberty; but still so that it be in war, and done by those who take\r\nthat liberty from us; but in the present case our enemies do neither\r\nmeet us in battle, nor do they kill us. Now he is equally a coward who\r\nwill not die when he is obliged to die, and he who will die when he is\r\nnot obliged so to do. What are we afraid of, when we will not go up\r\nto the Romans? Is it death? If so, what we are afraid of, when we\r\nbut suspect our enemies will inflict it on us, shall we inflict it on\r\nourselves for certain? But it may be said we must be slaves. And are we\r\nthen in a clear state of liberty at present? It may also be said that\r\nit is a manly act for one to kill himself. No, certainly, but a most\r\nunmanly one; as I should esteem that pilot to be an arrant coward, who,\r\nout of fear of a storm, should sink his ship of his own accord. Now\r\nself-murder is a crime most remote from the common nature of all\r\nanimals, and an instance of impiety against God our Creator; nor indeed\r\nis there any animal that dies by its own contrivance, or by its own\r\nmeans, for the desire of life is a law engraven in them all; on which\r\naccount we deem those that openly take it away from us to be our\r\nenemies, and those that do it by treachery are punished for so doing.\r\nAnd do not you think that God is very angry when a man does injury to\r\nwhat he hath bestowed on him? For from him it is that we have received\r\nour being, and we ought to leave it to his disposal to take that being\r\naway from us. The bodies of all men are indeed mortal, and are created\r\nout of corruptible matter; but the soul is ever immortal, and is a\r\nportion of the divinity that inhabits our bodies. Besides, if any one\r\ndestroys or abuses a depositum he hath received from a mere man, he is\r\nesteemed a wicked and perfidious person; but then if any one cast out\r\nof his body this Divine depositum, can we imagine that he who is thereby\r\naffronted does not know of it? Moreover, our law justly ordains that\r\nslaves which run away from their master shall be punished, though the\r\nmasters they run away from may have been wicked masters to them. And\r\nshall we endeavor to run away from God, who is the best of all masters,\r\nand not guilty of impeity? Do not you know that those who depart out of\r\nthis life according to the law of nature, and pay that debt which was\r\nreceived from God, when he that lent it us is pleased to require it back\r\nagain, enjoy eternal fame; that their houses and their posterity are\r\nsure, that their souls are pure and obedient, and obtain a most holy\r\nplace in heaven, from whence, in the revolutions of ages, they are again\r\nsent into pure bodies; while the souls of those whose hands have acted\r\nmadly against themselves are received by the darkest place in Hades,\r\nand while God, who is their Father, punishes those that offend against\r\neither of them in their posterity? for which reason God hates such\r\ndoings, and the crime is punished by our most wise legislator.\r\nAccordingly, our laws determine that the bodies of such as kill\r\nthemselves should be exposed till the sun be set, without burial,\r\nalthough at the same time it be allowed by them to be lawful to bury our\r\nenemies [sooner]. The laws of other nations also enjoin such men's\r\nhands to be cut off when they are dead, which had been made use of in\r\ndestroying themselves when alive, while they reckoned that as the\r\nbody is alien from the soul, so is the hand alien from the body. It is\r\ntherefore, my friends, a right thing to reason justly, and not add to\r\nthe calamities which men bring upon us impiety towards our Creator. If\r\nwe have a mind to preserve ourselves, let us do it; for to be preserved\r\nby those our enemies, to whom we have given so many demonstrations of\r\nour courage, is no way inglorious; but if we have a mind to die, it is\r\ngood to die by the hand of those that have conquered us. For my part, I\r\nwill not run over to our enemies' quarters, in order to be a traitor to\r\nmyself; for certainly I should then be much more foolish than those that\r\ndeserted to the enemy, since they did it in order to save themselves,\r\nand I should do it for destruction, for my own destruction. However, I\r\nheartily wish the Romans may prove treacherous in this matter; for if,\r\nafter their offer of their right hand for security, I be slain by\r\nthem, I shall die cheerfully, and carry away with me the sense of their\r\nperfidiousness, as a consolation greater than victory itself.\"\r\n\r\n6. Now these and many the like motives did Josephus use to these men to\r\nprevent their murdering themselves; but desperation had shut their ears,\r\nas having long ago devoted themselves to die, and they were irritated at\r\nJosephus. They then ran upon him with their swords in their hands, one\r\nfrom one quarter, and another from another, and called him a coward, and\r\neveryone of them appeared openly as if he were ready to smite him;\r\nbut he calling to one of them by name, and looking like a general to\r\nanother, and taking a third by the hand, and making a fourth ashamed\r\nof himself, by praying him to forbear, and being in this condition\r\ndistracted with various passions, [as he well might in the great\r\ndistress he was then in,] he kept off every one of their swords\r\nfrom killing him, and was forced to do like such wild beasts as are\r\nencompassed about on every side, who always turn themselves against\r\nthose that last touched them. Nay, some of their right hands were\r\ndebilitated by the reverence they bare to their general in these his\r\nfatal calamities, and their swords dropped out of their hands; and not\r\na few of them there were, who, when they aimed to smite him with their\r\nswords, they were not thoroughly either willing or able to do it.\r\n\r\n7. However, in this extreme distress, he was not destitute of his usual\r\nsagacity; but trusting himself to the providence of God, he put his life\r\ninto hazard [in the manner following]: \"And now,\" said he, \"since it is\r\nresolved among you that you will die, come on, let us commit our mutual\r\ndeaths to determination by lot. He whom the lot falls to first, let him\r\nbe killed by him that hath the second lot, and thus fortune shall make\r\nits progress through us all; nor shall any of us perish by his own right\r\nhand, for it would be unfair if, when the rest are gone, somebody should\r\nrepent and save himself.\" This proposal appeared to them to be very\r\njust; and when he had prevailed with them to determine this matter by\r\nlots, he drew one of the lots for himself also. He who had the first\r\nlot laid his neck bare to him that had the next, as supposing that the\r\ngeneral would die among them immediately; for they thought death, if\r\nJosephus might but die with them, was sweeter than life; yet was he with\r\nanother left to the last, whether we must say it happened so by chance,\r\nor whether by the providence of God. And as he was very desirous neither\r\nto be condemned by the lot, nor, if he had been left to the last, to\r\nimbrue his right hand in the blood of his countrymen, he persuaded him\r\nto trust his fidelity to him, and to live as well as himself.\r\n\r\n8. Thus Josephus escaped in the war with the Romans, and in this his own\r\nwar with his friends, and was led by Nicanor to Vespasian. But now all\r\nthe Romans ran together to see him; and as the multitude pressed one\r\nupon another about their general, there was a tumult of a various kind;\r\nwhile some rejoiced that Josephus was taken, and some threatened him,\r\nand some crowded to see him very near; but those that were more remote\r\ncried out to have this their enemy put to death, while those that were\r\nnear called to mind the actions he had done, and a deep concern\r\nappeared at the change of his fortune. Nor were there any of the Roman\r\ncommanders, how much soever they had been enraged at him before, but\r\nrelented when they came to the sight of him. Above all the rest, Titus's\r\nown valor, and Josephus's own patience under his afflictions, made him\r\npity him, as did also the commiseration of his age, when he recalled\r\nto mind that but a little while ago he was fighting, but lay now in the\r\nhands of his enemies, which made him consider the power of fortune,\r\nand how quick is the turn of affairs in war, and how no state of men is\r\nsure; for which reason he then made a great many more to be of the same\r\npitiful temper with himself, and induced them to commiserate Josephus.\r\nHe was also of great weight in persuading his father to preserve him.\r\nHowever, Vespasian gave strict orders that he should be kept with great\r\ncaution, as though he would in a very little time send him to Nero. 5\r\n\r\n9. When Josephus heard him give those orders, he said that he had\r\nsomewhat in his mind that he would willingly say to himself alone. When\r\ntherefore they were all ordered to withdraw, excepting Titus and two of\r\ntheir friends, he said, \"Thou, O Vespasian, thinkest no more than\r\nthat thou hast taken Josephus himself captive; but I come to thee as a\r\nmessenger of greater tidings; for had not I been sent by God to thee,\r\nI knew what was the law of the Jews in this case? and how it becomes\r\ngenerals to die. Dost thou send me to Nero? For why? Are Nero's\r\nsuccessors till they come to thee still alive? Thou, O Vespasian, art\r\nCaesar and emperor, thou, and this thy son. Bind me now still faster,\r\nand keep me for thyself, for thou, O Caesar, are not only lord over me,\r\nbut over the land and the sea, and all mankind; and certainly I deserve\r\nto be kept in closer custody than I now am in, in order to be punished,\r\nif I rashly affirm any thing of God.\" When he had said this, Vespasian\r\nat present did not believe him, but supposed that Josephus said this as\r\na cunning trick, in order to his own preservation; but in a little time\r\nhe was convinced, and believed what he said to be true, God himself\r\nerecting his expectations, so as to think of obtaining the empire, and\r\nby other signs fore-showing his advancement. He also found Josephus to\r\nhave spoken truth on other occasions; for one of those friends that were\r\npresent at that secret conference said to Josephus, \"I cannot but wonder\r\nhow thou couldst not foretell to the people of Jotapata that they should\r\nbe taken, nor couldst foretell this captivity which hath happened to\r\nthyself, unless what thou now sayest be a vain thing, in order to avoid\r\nthe rage that is risen against thyself.\" To which Josephus replied, \"I\r\ndid foretell to the people of Jotapata that they would be taken on the\r\nforty-seventh day, and that I should be caught alive by the Romans.\"\r\nNow when Vespasian had inquired of the captives privately about these\r\npredictions, he found them to be true, and then he began to believe\r\nthose that concerned himself. Yet did he not set Josephus at liberty\r\nfrom his hands, but bestowed on him suits of clothes, and other precious\r\ngifts; he treated him also in a very obliging manner, and continued so\r\nto do, Titus still joining his interest in the honors that were done\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Joppa Was Taken, And Tiberias Delivered Up.\r\n\r\n1. Now Vespasian returned to Ptolemais on the fourth day of the month\r\nPanemus, [Tamus] and from thence he came to Cesarea, which lay by the\r\nsea-side. This was a very great city of Judea, and for the greatest part\r\ninhabited by Greeks: the citizens here received both the Roman army and\r\nits general, with all sorts of acclamations and rejoicings, and this\r\npartly out of the good-will they bore to the Romans, but principally out\r\nof the hatred they bore to those that were conquered by them; on which\r\naccount they came clamoring against Josephus in crowds, and desired\r\nhe might be put to death. But Vespasian passed over this petition\r\nconcerning him, as offered by the injudicious multitude, with a bare\r\nsilence. Two of the legions also he placed at Cesarea, that they might\r\nthere take their winter-quarters, as perceiving the city very fit for\r\nsuch a purpose; but he placed the tenth and the fifth at Scythopolis,\r\nthat he might not distress Cesarea with the entire army. This place was\r\nwarm even in winter, as it was suffocating hot in the summer time, by\r\nreason of its situation in a plain, and near to the sea [of Galilee].\r\n\r\n2. In the mean time, there were gathered together as well such as had\r\nseditiously got out from among their enemies, as those that had escaped\r\nout of the demolished cities, which were in all a great number, and\r\nrepaired Joppa, which had been left desolate by Cestius, that it might\r\nserve them for a place of refuge; and because the adjoining region had\r\nbeen laid waste in the war, and was not capable of supporting them, they\r\ndetermined to go off to sea. They also built themselves a great many\r\npiratical ships, and turned pirates upon the seas near to Syria, and\r\nPhoenicia, and Egypt, and made those seas unnavigable to all men. Now\r\nas soon as Vespasian knew of their conspiracy, he sent both footmen and\r\nhorsemen to Joppa, which was unguarded in the night time; however, those\r\nthat were in it perceived that they should be attacked, and were afraid\r\nof it; yet did they not endeavor to keep the Romans out, but fled to\r\ntheir ships, and lay at sea all night, out of the reach of their darts.\r\n\r\n3. Now Joppa is not naturally a haven, for it ends in a rough shore,\r\nwhere all the rest of it is straight, but the two ends bend towards each\r\nother, where there are deep precipices, and great stones that jut out\r\ninto the sea, and where the chains wherewith Andromeda was bound have\r\nleft their footsteps, which attest to the antiquity of that fable. But\r\nthe north wind opposes and beats upon the shore, and dashes mighty\r\nwaves against the rocks which receive them, and renders the haven more\r\ndangerous than the country they had deserted. Now as those people of\r\nJoppa were floating about in this sea, in the morning there fell a\r\nviolent wind upon them; it is called by those that sail there \"the\r\nblack north wind,\" and there dashed their ships one against another,\r\nand dashed some of them against the rocks, and carried many of them by\r\nforce, while they strove against the opposite waves, into the main sea;\r\nfor the shore was so rocky, and had so many of the enemy upon it, that\r\nthey were afraid to come to land; nay, the waves rose so very high, that\r\nthey drowned them; nor was there any place whither they could fly, nor\r\nany way to save themselves; while they were thrust out of the sea, by\r\nthe violence of the wind, if they staid where they were, and out of the\r\ncity by the violence of the Romans. And much lamentation there was when\r\nthe ships were dashed against one another, and a terrible noise when\r\nthey were broken to pieces; and some of the multitude that were in\r\nthem were covered with waves, and so perished, and a great many were\r\nembarrassed with shipwrecks. But some of them thought that to die\r\nby their own swords was lighter than by the sea, and so they killed\r\nthemselves before they were drowned; although the greatest part of them\r\nwere carried by the waves, and dashed to pieces against the abrupt\r\nparts of the rocks, insomuch that the sea was bloody a long way, and the\r\nmaritime parts were full of dead bodies; for the Romans came upon those\r\nthat were carried to the shore, and destroyed them; and the number of\r\nthe bodies that were thus thrown out of the sea was four thousand and\r\ntwo hundred. The Romans also took the city without opposition, and\r\nutterly demolished it.\r\n\r\n4. And thus was Joppa taken twice by the Romans in a little time; but\r\nVespasian, in order to prevent these pirates from coming thither any\r\nmore, erected a camp there, where the citadel of Joppa had been, and\r\nleft a body of horse in it, with a few footmen, that these last might\r\nstay there and guard the camp, and the horsemen might spoil the country\r\nthat lay round it, and might destroy the neighboring villages and\r\nsmaller cities. So these troops overran the country, as they were\r\nordered to do, and every day cut to pieces and laid desolate the whole\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n5. But now, when the fate of Jotapata was related at Jerusalem, a great\r\nmany at the first disbelieved it, on account of the vastness of the\r\ncalamity, and because they had no eye-witness to attest the truth\r\nof what was related about it; for not one person was saved to be a\r\nmessenger of that news, but a fame was spread abroad at random that the\r\ncity was taken, as such fame usually spreads bad news about. However,\r\nthe truth was known by degrees, from the places near Jotapata, and\r\nappeared to all to be too true. Yet were there fictitious stories added\r\nto what was really done; for it was reported that Josephus was slain\r\nat the taking of the city, which piece of news filled Jerusalem full of\r\nsorrow. In every house also, and among all to whom any of the slain\r\nwere allied, there was a lamentation for them; but the mourning for the\r\ncommander was a public one; and some mourned for those that had lived\r\nwith them, others for their kindred, others for their friends, and\r\nothers for their brethren, but all mourned for Josephus; insomuch that\r\nthe lamentation did not cease in the city before the thirtieth day;\r\nand a great many hired mourners, with their pipes, who should begin the\r\nmelancholy ditties for them.\r\n\r\n6. But as the truth came out in time, it appeared how the affairs of\r\nJotapata really stood; yet was it found that the death of Josephus was\r\na fiction; and when they understood that he was alive, and was among the\r\nRomans, and that the commanders treated him at another rate than they\r\ntreated captives, they were as vehemently angry at him now as they had\r\nshowed their good-will before, when he appeared to have been dead. He\r\nwas also abused by some as having been a coward, and by others as a\r\ndeserter; and the city was full of indignation at him, and of reproaches\r\ncast upon him; their rage was also aggravated by their afflictions, and\r\nmore inflamed by their ill success; and what usually becomes an occasion\r\nof caution to wise men, I mean affliction, became a spur to them to\r\nventure on further calamities, and the end of one misery became still\r\nthe beginning of another; they therefore resolved to fall on the Romans\r\nthe more vehemently, as resolving to be revenged on him in revenging\r\nthemselves on the Romans. And this was the state of Jerusalem as to the\r\ntroubles which now came upon it.\r\n\r\n7. But Vespasian, in order to see the kingdom of Agrippa, while the king\r\npersuaded himself so to do, [partly in order to his treating the general\r\nand his army in the best and most splendid manner his private affairs\r\nwould enable him to do, and partly that he might, by their means,\r\ncorrect such things as were amiss in his government,] he removed from\r\nthat Cesarea which was by the sea-side, and went to that which is called\r\nCesarea Philippi 6 and there he refreshed his army for twenty days,\r\nand was himself feasted by king Agrippa, where he also returned public\r\nthanks to God for the good success he had had in his undertakings. But\r\nas soon as he was informed that Tiberias was fond of innovations, and\r\nthat Taricheae had revolted, both which cities were parts of the kingdom\r\nof Agrippa, and was satisfied within himself that the Jews were every\r\nwhere perverted [from their obedience to their governors], he thought it\r\nseasonable to make an expedition against these cities, and that for the\r\nsake of Agrippa, and in order to bring his cities to reason. So he sent\r\naway his son Titus to [the other] Cesarea, that he might bring the army\r\nthat lay there to Seythopous, which is the largest city of Decapolis,\r\nand in the neighborhood of Tiberias, whither he came, and where he\r\nwaited for his son. He then came with three legions, and pitched his\r\ncamp thirty furlongs off Tiberias, at a certain station easily seen\r\nby the innovators; it is named Sennabris. He also sent Valerian, a\r\ndecurion, with fifty horsemen, to speak peaceably to those that were in\r\nthe city, and to exhort them to give him assurances of their fidelity;\r\nfor he had heard that the people were desirous of peace, but were\r\nobliged by some of the seditious part to join with them, and so were\r\nforced to fight for them. When Valerian had marched up to the place, and\r\nwas near the wall, he alighted off his horse, and made those that were\r\nwith him to do the same, that they might not be thought to come to\r\nskirmish with them; but before they could come to a discourse one with\r\nanother, the most potent men among the seditious made a sally upon them\r\narmed; their leader was one whose name was Jesus, the son of Shaphat,\r\nthe principal head of a band of robbers. Now Valerian, neither thinking\r\nit safe to fight contrary to the commands of the general, though he\r\nwere secure of a victory, and knowing that it was a very hazardous\r\nundertaking for a few to fight with many, for those that were unprovided\r\nto fight those that were ready, and being on other accounts surprised at\r\nthis unexpected onset of the Jews, he ran away on foot, as did five of\r\nthe rest in like manner, and left their horses behind them; which horses\r\nJesus led away into the city, and rejoiced as if they had taken them in\r\nbattle, and not by treachery.\r\n\r\n8. Now the seniors of the people, and such as were of principal\r\nauthority among them, fearing what would be the issue of this matter,\r\nfled to the camp of the Romans; they then took their king along with\r\nthem, and fell down before Vespasian, to supplicate his favor, and\r\nbesought him not to overlook them, nor to impute the madness of a few to\r\nthe whole city, to spare a people that have been ever civil and\r\nobliging to the Romans; but to bring the authors of this revolt to due\r\npunishment, who had hitherto so watched them, that though they were\r\nzealous to give them the security of their right hands of a long time,\r\nyet could they not accomplish the same. With these supplications the\r\ngeneral complied, although he were very angry at the whole city about\r\nthe carrying off his horses, and this because he saw that Agrippa\r\nwas under a great concern for them. So when Vespasian and Agrippa had\r\naccepted of their right hands by way of security, Jesus and his party\r\nthought it not safe for them to continue at Tiberias, so they ran\r\naway to Taricheae. The next day Vespasian sent Trajan before with some\r\nhorsemen to the citadel, to make trial of the multitude, whether they\r\nwere all disposed for peace; and as soon as he knew that the people were\r\nof the same mind with the petitioner, he took his army, and went to the\r\ncity; upon which the citizens opened to him their gates, and met him\r\nwith acclamations of joy, and called him their savior and benefactor.\r\nBut as the army was a great while in getting in at the gates, they were\r\nso narrow, Vespasian commanded the south wall to be broken down, and\r\nso made a broad passage for their entrance. However, he charged them to\r\nabstain from rapine and injustice, in order to gratify the king; and on\r\nhis account spared the rest of the wall, while the king undertook for\r\nthem that they should continue [faithful to the Romans] for the time to\r\ncome. And thus did he restore this city to a quiet state, after it had\r\nbeen grievously afflicted by the sedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Taricheae Was Taken. A Description Of The River Jordan,\r\n     And Of The Country Of Gennesareth.\r\n\r\n1. And now Vespasian pitched his camp between this city and Taricheae,\r\nbut fortified his camp more strongly, as suspecting that he should be\r\nforced to stay there, and have a long war; for all the innovators had\r\ngotten together at Taricheae, as relying upon the strength of the city,\r\nand on the lake that lay by it. This lake is called by the people of\r\nthe country the Lake of Gennesareth. The city itself is situated like\r\nTiberias, at the bottom of a mountain, and on those sides which are not\r\nwashed by the sea, had been strongly fortified by Josephus, though not\r\nso strongly as Tiberias; for the wall of Tiberias had been built at the\r\nbeginning of the Jews' revolt, when he had great plenty of money, and\r\ngreat power, but Taricheae partook only the remains of that liberality,\r\nYet had they a great number of ships gotten ready upon the lake, that,\r\nin case they were beaten at land, they might retire to them; and they\r\nwere so fitted up, that they might undertake a Sea-fight also. But as\r\nthe Romans were building a wall about their camp, Jesus and his party\r\nwere neither affrighted at their number, nor at the good order they were\r\nin, but made a sally upon them; and at the very first onset the builders\r\nof the wall were dispersed; and these pulled what little they had before\r\nbuilt to pieces; but as soon as they saw the armed men getting together,\r\nand before they had suffered any thing themselves, they retired to their\r\nown men. But then the Romans pursued them, and drove them into their\r\nships, where they launched out as far as might give them the opportunity\r\nof reaching the Romans with what they threw at them, and then cast\r\nanchor, and brought their ships close, as in a line of battle, and\r\nthence fought the enemy from the sea, who were themselves at land. But\r\nVespasian hearing that a great multitude of them were gotten together in\r\nthe plain that was before the city, he thereupon sent his son, with six\r\nhundred chosen horsemen, to disperse them.\r\n\r\n2. But when Titus perceived that the enemy was very numerous, he sent to\r\nhis father, and informed him that he should want more forces. But as\r\nhe saw a great many of the horsemen eager to fight, and that before any\r\nsuccors could come to them, and that yet some of them were privately\r\nunder a sort of consternation at the multitude of the Jews, he stood in\r\na place whence he might be heard, and said to them, \"My brave Romans!\r\nfor it is right for me to put you in mind of what nation you are, in the\r\nbeginning of my speech, that so you may not be ignorant who you are, and\r\nwho they are against whom we are going to fight. For as to us, Romans,\r\nno part of the habitable earth hath been able to escape our hands\r\nhitherto; but as for the Jews, that I may speak of them too, though they\r\nhave been already beaten, yet do they not give up the cause; and a sad\r\nthing it would be for us to grow wealthy under good success, when they\r\nbear up under their misfortunes. As to the alacrity which you show\r\npublicly, I see it, and rejoice at it; yet am I afraid lest the\r\nmultitude of the enemy should bring a concealed fright upon some of you:\r\nlet such a one consider again, who we are that are to fight, and who\r\nthose are against whom we are to fight. Now these Jews, though they be\r\nvery bold and great despisers of death, are but a disorderly body, and\r\nunskillful in war, and may rather be called a rout than an army; while I\r\nneed say nothing of our skill and our good order; for this is the reason\r\nwhy we Romans alone are exercised for war in time of peace, that we may\r\nnot think of number for number when we come to fight with our enemies:\r\nfor what advantage should we reap by our continual sort of warfare, if\r\nwe must still be equal in number to such as have not been used to war.\r\nConsider further, that you are to have a conflict with men in effect\r\nunarmed, while you are well armed; with footmen, while you are horsemen;\r\nwith those that have no good general, while you have one; and as these\r\nadvantages make you in effect manifold more than you are, so do\r\ntheir disadvantages mightily diminish their number. Now it is not\r\nthe multitude of men, though they be soldiers, that manages wars with\r\nsuccess, but it is their bravery that does it, though they be but a\r\nfew; for a few are easily set in battle-array, and can easily assist one\r\nanother, while over-numerous armies are more hurt by themselves than by\r\ntheir enemies. It is boldness and rashness, the effects of madness, that\r\nconduct the Jews. Those passions indeed make a great figure when they\r\nsucceed, but are quite extinguished upon the least ill success; but we\r\nare led on by courage, and obedience, and fortitude, which shows itself\r\nindeed in our good fortune, but still does not for ever desert us in our\r\nill fortune. Nay, indeed, your fighting is to be on greater motives than\r\nthose of the Jews; for although they run the hazard of war for liberty,\r\nand for their country, yet what can be a greater motive to us than\r\nglory? and that it may never be said, that after we have got dominion\r\nof the habitable earth, the Jews are able to confront us. We must also\r\nreflect upon this, that there is no fear of our suffering any incurable\r\ndisaster in the present case; for those that are ready to assist us\r\nare many, and at hand also; yet it is in our power to seize upon this\r\nvictory ourselves; and I think we ought to prevent the coming of those\r\nmy father is sending to us for our assistance, that our success may be\r\npeculiar to ourselves, and of greater reputation to us. And I cannot but\r\nthink this an opportunity wherein my father, and I, and you shall be\r\nall put to the trial, whether he be worthy of his former glorious\r\nperformances, whether I be his son in reality, and whether you be really\r\nmy soldiers; for it is usual for my father to conquer; and for myself, I\r\nshould not bear the thoughts of returning to him if I were once taken\r\nby the enemy. And how will you be able to avoid being ashamed, if you do\r\nnot show equal courage with your commander, when he goes before you into\r\ndanger? For you know very well that I shall go into the danger first,\r\nand make the first attack upon the enemy. Do not you therefore desert\r\nme, but persuade yourselves that God will be assisting to my onset. Know\r\nthis also before we begin, that we shall now have better success than we\r\nshould have, if we were to fight at a distance.\"\r\n\r\n3. As Titus was saying this, an extraordinary fury fell upon the men;\r\nand as Trajan was already come before the fight began, with four hundred\r\nhorsemen, they were uneasy at it, because the reputation of the victory\r\nwould be diminished by being common to so many. Vespasian had also sent\r\nboth Antonius and Silo, with two thousand archers, and had given it them\r\nin charge to seize upon the mountain that was over against the city,\r\nand repel those that were upon the wall; which archers did as they were\r\ncommanded, and prevented those that attempted to assist them that way;\r\nAnd now Titus made his own horse march first against the enemy, as did\r\nthe others with a great noise after him, and extended themselves upon\r\nthe plain as wide as the enemy which confronted them; by which means\r\nthey appeared much more numerous than they really were. Now the Jews,\r\nalthough they were surprised at their onset, and at their good order,\r\nmade resistance against their attacks for a little while; but when they\r\nwere pricked with their long poles, and overborne by the violent noise\r\nof the horsemen, they came to be trampled under their feet; many also of\r\nthem were slain on every side, which made them disperse themselves,\r\nand run to the city, as fast as every one of them were able. So Titus\r\npressed upon the hindmost, and slew them; and of the rest, some he fell\r\nupon as they stood on heaps, and some he prevented, and met them in the\r\nmouth, and run them through; many also he leaped upon as they fell one\r\nupon another, and trod them down, and cut off all the retreat they had\r\nto the wall, and turned them back into the plain, till at last they\r\nforced a passage by their multitude, and got away, and ran into the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n4. But now there fell out a terrible sedition among them within the\r\ncity; for the inhabitants themselves, who had possessions there, and\r\nto whom the city belonged, were not disposed to fight from the very\r\nbeginning; and now the less so, because they had been beaten; but the\r\nforeigners, which were very numerous, would force them to fight so much\r\nthe more, insomuch that there was a clamor and a tumult among them, as\r\nall mutually angry one at another. And when Titus heard this tumult, for\r\nhe was not far from the wall, he cried out, \"Fellow soldiers, now is the\r\ntime; and why do we make any delay, when God is giving up the Jews to\r\nus? Take the victory which is given you: do not you hear what a noise\r\nthey make? Those that have escaped our hands are in an uproar against\r\none another. We have the city if we make haste; but besides haste, we\r\nmust undergo some labor, and use some courage; for no great thing uses\r\nto be accomplished without danger: accordingly, we must not only prevent\r\ntheir uniting again, which necessity will soon compel them to do, but we\r\nmust also prevent the coming of our own men to our assistance, that, as\r\nfew as we are, we may conquer so great a multitude, and may ourselves\r\nalone take the city.\"\r\n\r\n5. As soon as ever Titus had said this, he leaped upon his horse, and\r\nrode apace down to the lake; by which lake he marched, and entered\r\ninto the city the first of them all, as did the others soon after him.\r\nHereupon those that were upon the walls were seized with a terror at the\r\nboldness of the attempt, nor durst any one venture to fight with him,\r\nor to hinder him; so they left guarding the city, and some of those that\r\nwere about Jesus fled over the country, while others of them ran down\r\nto the lake, and met the enemy in the teeth, and some were slain as they\r\nwere getting up into the ships, but others of them as they attempted\r\nto overtake those that were already gone aboard. There was also a great\r\nslaughter made in the city, while those foreigners that had not fled\r\naway already made opposition; but the natural inhabitants were killed\r\nwithout fighting: for in hopes of Titus's giving them his right hand for\r\ntheir security, and out of a consciousness that they had not given any\r\nconsent to the war, they avoided fighting, till Titus had slain the\r\nauthors of this revolt, and then put a stop to any further slaughters,\r\nout of commiseration of these inhabitants of the place. But for those\r\nthat had fled to the lake, upon seeing the city taken, they sailed as\r\nfar as they possibly could from the enemy.\r\n\r\n6. Hereupon Titus sent one of his horsemen to his father, and let him\r\nknow the good news of what he had done; at which, as was natural, he was\r\nvery joyful, both on account of the courage and glorious actions of his\r\nson; for he thought that now the greatest part of the war was over. He\r\nthen came thither himself, and set men to guard the city, and gave them\r\ncommand to take care that nobody got privately out of it, but to kill\r\nsuch as attempted so to do. And on the next day he went down to the\r\nlake, and commanded that vessels should be fitted up, in order to pursue\r\nthose that had escaped in the ships. These vessels were quickly gotten\r\nready accordingly, because there was great plenty of materials, and a\r\ngreat number of artificers also.\r\n\r\n7. Now this lake of Gennesareth is so called from the country adjoining\r\nto it. Its breadth is forty furlongs, and its length one hundred and\r\nforty; its waters are sweet, and very agreeable for drinking, for they\r\nare finer than the thick waters of other fens; the lake is also pure,\r\nand on every side ends directly at the shores, and at the sand; it is\r\nalso of a temperate nature when you draw it up, and of a more gentle\r\nnature than river or fountain water, and yet always cooler than one\r\ncould expect in so diffuse a place as this is. Now when this water\r\nis kept in the open air, it is as cold as that snow which the country\r\npeople are accustomed to make by night in summer. There are several\r\nkinds of fish in it, different both to the taste and the sight from\r\nthose elsewhere. It is divided into two parts by the river Jordan. Now\r\nPanium is thought to be the fountain of Jordan, but in reality it is\r\ncarried thither after an occult manner from the place called Phiala:\r\nthis place lies as you go up to Trachonitis, and is a hundred and twenty\r\nfurlongs from Cesarea, and is not far out of the road on the right hand;\r\nand indeed it hath its name of Phiala [vial or bowl] very justly, from\r\nthe roundness of its circumference, as being round like a wheel; its\r\nwater continues always up to its edges, without either sinking or\r\nrunning over. And as this origin of Jordan was formerly not known, it\r\nwas discovered so to be when Philip was tetrarch of Trachonitis; for\r\nhe had chaff thrown into Phiala, and it was found at Paninto, where the\r\nancients thought the fountain-head of the river was, whither it had been\r\ntherefore carried [by the waters]. As for Panium itself, its natural\r\nbeauty had been improved by the royal liberality of Agrippa, and adorned\r\nat his expenses. Now Jordan's visible stream arises from this cavern,\r\nand divides the marshes and fens of the lake Semechonitis; when it hath\r\nrun another hundred and twenty furlongs, it first passes by the city\r\nJulias, and then passes through the middle of the lake Gennesareth;\r\nafter which it runs a long way over a desert, and then makes its exit\r\ninto the lake Asphaltites.\r\n\r\n8. The country also that lies over against this lake hath the same name\r\nof Gennesareth; its nature is wonderful as well as its beauty; its\r\nsoil is so fruitful that all sorts of trees can grow upon it, and the\r\ninhabitants accordingly plant all sorts of trees there; for the temper\r\nof the air is so well mixed, that it agrees very well with those several\r\nsorts, particularly walnuts, which require the coldest air, flourish\r\nthere in vast plenty; there are palm trees also, which grow best in hot\r\nair; fig trees also and olives grow near them, which yet require an air\r\nthat is more temperate. One may call this place the ambition of nature,\r\nwhere it forces those plants that are naturally enemies to one another\r\nto agree together; it is a happy contention of the seasons, as if\r\nevery one of them laid claim to this country; for it not only nourishes\r\ndifferent sorts of autumnal fruit beyond men's expectation, but\r\npreserves them a great while; it supplies men with the principal fruits,\r\nwith grapes and figs continually, during ten months of the year 7 and\r\nthe rest of the fruits as they become ripe together through the whole\r\nyear; for besides the good temperature of the air, it is also watered\r\nfrom a most fertile fountain. The people of the country call it\r\nCapharnaum. Some have thought it to be a vein of the Nile, because it\r\nproduces the Coracin fish as well as that lake does which is near to\r\nAlexandria. The length of this country extends itself along the banks\r\nof this lake that bears the same name for thirty furlongs, and is in\r\nbreadth twenty, And this is the nature of that place.\r\n\r\n9. But now, when the vessels were gotten ready, Vespasian put upon\r\nship-board as many of his forces as he thought sufficient to be too hard\r\nfor those that were upon the lake, and set sail after them. Now these\r\nwhich were driven into the lake could neither fly to the land, where\r\nall was in their enemies' hand, and in war against them; nor could they\r\nfight upon the level by sea, for their ships were small and fitted only\r\nfor piracy; they were too weak to fight with Vespasian's vessels, and\r\nthe mariners that were in them were so few, that they were afraid to\r\ncome near the Romans, who attacked them in great numbers. However, as\r\nthey sailed round about the vessels, and sometimes as they came near\r\nthem, they threw stones at the Romans when they were a good way off,\r\nor came closer and fought them; yet did they receive the greatest harm\r\nthemselves in both cases. As for the stones they threw at the Romans,\r\nthey only made a sound one after another, for they threw them against\r\nsuch as were in their armor, while the Roman darts could reach the Jews\r\nthemselves; and when they ventured to come near the Romans, they became\r\nsufferers themselves before they could do any harm to the ether,\r\nand were drowned, they and their ships together. As for those that\r\nendeavored to come to an actual fight, the Romans ran many of them\r\nthrough with their long poles. Sometimes the Romans leaped into their\r\nships, with swords in their hands, and slew them; but when some of them\r\nmet the vessels, the Romans caught them by the middle, and destroyed at\r\nonce their ships and themselves who were taken in them. And for such as\r\nwere drowning in the sea, if they lifted their heads up above the water,\r\nthey were either killed by darts, or caught by the vessels; but if,\r\nin the desperate case they were in, they attempted to swim to their\r\nenemies, the Romans cut off either their heads or their hands; and\r\nindeed they were destroyed after various manners every where, till the\r\nrest being put to flight, were forced to get upon the land, while the\r\nvessels encompassed them about [on the sea]: but as many of these were\r\nrepulsed when they were getting ashore, they were killed by the darts\r\nupon the lake; and the Romans leaped out of their vessels, and destroyed\r\na great many more upon the land: one might then see the lake all bloody,\r\nand full of dead bodies, for not one of them escaped. And a terrible\r\nstink, and a very sad sight there was on the following days over that\r\ncountry; for as for the shores, they were full of shipwrecks, and of\r\ndead bodies all swelled; and as the dead bodies were inflamed by the\r\nsun, and putrefied, they corrupted the air, insomuch that the misery\r\nwas not only the object of commiseration to the Jews, but to those that\r\nhated them, and had been the authors of that misery. This was the upshot\r\nof the sea-fight. The number of the slain, including those that were\r\nkilled in the city before, was six thousand and five hundred.\r\n\r\n10. After this fight was over, Vespasian sat upon his tribunal\r\nat Taricheae, in order to distinguish the foreigners from the old\r\ninhabitants; for those foreigners appear to have begun the war. So he\r\ndeliberated with the other commanders, whether he ought to save those\r\nold inhabitants or not. And when those commanders alleged that the\r\ndismission of them would be to his own disadvantage, because, when they\r\nwere once set at liberty, they would not be at rest, since they would be\r\npeople destitute of proper habitations, and would be able to compel such\r\nas they fled to fight against us, Vespasian acknowledged that they did\r\nnot deserve to be saved, and that if they had leave given them to fly\r\naway, they would make use of it against those that gave them that leave.\r\nBut still he considered with himself after what manner they should be\r\nslain 8 for if he had them slain there, he suspected the people of the\r\ncountry would thereby become his enemies; for that to be sure they would\r\nnever bear it, that so many that had been supplicants to him should\r\nbe killed; and to offer violence to them, after he had given them\r\nassurances of their lives, he could not himself bear to do it. However,\r\nhis friends were too hard for him, and pretended that nothing against\r\nJews could be any impiety, and that he ought to prefer what was\r\nprofitable before what was fit to be done, where both could not be made\r\nconsistent. So he gave them an ambiguous liberty to do as they advised,\r\nand permitted the prisoners to go along no other road than that which\r\nled to Tiberias only. So they readily believed what they desired to be\r\ntrue, and went along securely, with their effects, the way which was\r\nallowed them, while the Romans seized upon all the road that led to\r\nTiberias, that none of them might go out of it, and shut them up in the\r\ncity. Then came Vespasian, and ordered them all to stand in the stadium,\r\nand commanded them to kill the old men, together with the others that\r\nwere useless, which were in number a thousand and two hundred. Out of\r\nthe young men he chose six thousand of the strongest, and sent them to\r\nNero, to dig through the Isthmus, and sold the remainder for slaves,\r\nbeing thirty thousand and four hundred, besides such as he made a\r\npresent of to Agrippa; for as to those that belonged to his kingdom, he\r\ngave him leave to do what he pleased with them; however, the king sold\r\nthese also for slaves; but for the rest of the multitude, who were\r\nTrachonites, and Gaulanites, and of Hippos, and some of Gadara, the\r\ngreatest part of them were seditious persons and fugitives, who were of\r\nsuch shameful characters, that they preferred war before peace. These\r\nprisoners were taken on the eighth day of the month Gorpieus [Elul].\r\n\r\nWAR BOOK 3 FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Take the confirmation of this in the words of Suetonius,\r\nhere produced by Dr. Hudson: \"In the reign of Claudius,\" says he,\r\n\"Vespasian, for the sake of Narcissus, was sent as a lieutenant of a\r\nlegion into Germany. Thence he removed into Britain battles with the\r\nenemy.\" In Vesp. sect. 4. We may also here note from Josephus, that\r\nClaudius the emperor, who triumphed for the conquest of Britain, was\r\nenabled so to do by Vespasian's conduct and bravery, and that he is here\r\nstyled \"the father of Vespasian.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Spanheim and Reland both agree, that the two cities here\r\nesteemed greater than Antioch, the metropolis of Syria, were Rome and\r\nAlexandria; nor is there any occasion for doubt in so plain a case.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ This description of the exact symmetry and regularity of\r\nthe Roman army, and of the Roman encampments, with the sounding their\r\ntrumpets, etc. and order of war, described in this and the next chapter,\r\nis so very like to the symmetry and regularity of the people of Israel\r\nin the wilderness, [see Description of the Temples, ch. 9.,] that one\r\ncannot well avoid the supposal, that the one was the ultimate pattern\r\nof the other, and that the tactics of the ancients were taken from the\r\nrules given by God to Moses.

Now all those Galileans who, after the taking of Jotapata, had\r\nrevolted from the Romans, did, upon the conquest of Taricheae, deliver\r\nthemselves up to them again. And the Romans received all the fortresses\r\nand the cities, excepting Gischala and those that had seized upon Mount\r\nTabor; Gamala also, which is a city over against Taricheae, but on the\r\nother side of the lake, conspired with them. This city lay upon the\r\nborders of Agrippa's kingdom, as also did Sogana and Seleucia. And these\r\nwere both parts of Gaulanitis; for Sogana was a part of that called\r\nthe Upper Gaulanitis, as was Gamala of the Lower; while Seleucia was\r\nsituated at the lake Semechouitis, which lake is thirty furlongs in\r\nbreadth, and sixty in length; its marshes reach as far as the place\r\nDaphne, which in other respects is a delicious place, and hath such\r\nfountains as supply water to what is called Little Jordan, under the\r\ntemple of the golden calf, 1 where it is sent into Great Jordan. Now\r\nAgrippa had united Sogana and Seleucia by leagues to himself, at the\r\nvery beginning of the revolt from the Romans; yet did not Gamala accede\r\nto them, but relied upon the difficulty of the place, which was greater\r\nthan that of Jotapata, for it was situated upon a rough ridge of a high\r\nmountain, with a kind of neck in the middle: where it begins to ascend,\r\nit lengthens itself, and declines as much downward before as behind,\r\ninsomuch that it is like a camel in figure, from whence it is so named,\r\nalthough the people of the country do not pronounce it accurately. Both\r\non the side and the face there are abrupt parts divided from the rest,\r\nand ending in vast deep valleys; yet are the parts behind, where they\r\nare joined to the mountain, somewhat easier of ascent than the other;\r\nbut then the people belonging to the place have cut an oblique ditch\r\nthere, and made that hard to be ascended also. On its acclivity, which\r\nis straight, houses are built, and those very thick and close to one\r\nanother. The city also hangs so strangely, that it looks as if it would\r\nfall down upon itself, so sharp is it at the top. It is exposed to the\r\nsouth, and its southern mount, which reaches to an immense height, was\r\nin the nature of a citadel to the city; and above that was a precipice,\r\nnot walled about, but extending itself to an immense depth. There was\r\nalso a spring of water within the wall, at the utmost limits of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n2. As this city was naturally hard to be taken, so had Josephus, by\r\nbuilding a wall about it, made it still stronger, as also by ditches and\r\nmines under ground. The people that were in it were made more bold by\r\nthe nature of the place than the people of Jotapata had been, but it\r\nhad much fewer fighting men in it; and they had such a confidence in\r\nthe situation of the place, that they thought the enemy could not be too\r\nmany for them; for the city had been filled with those that had fled\r\nto it for safety, on account of its strength; on which account they\r\nhad been able to resist those whom Agrippa sent to besiege it for seven\r\nmonths together.\r\n\r\n3. But Vespasian removed from Emmaus, where he had last pitched his\r\ncamp before the city Tiberias, [now Emmaus, if it be interpreted, may\r\nbe rendered \"a warm bath,\" for therein is a spring of warm water, useful\r\nfor healing,] and came to Gamala; yet was its situation such that he was\r\nnot able to encompass it all round with soldiers to watch it; but where\r\nthe places were practicable, he set men to watch it, and seized upon the\r\nmountain which was over it. And as the legions, according to their usual\r\ncustom, were fortifying their camp upon that mountain, he began to cast\r\nup banks at the bottom, at the part towards the east, where the highest\r\ntower of the whole city was, and where the fifteenth legion pitched\r\ntheir camp; while the fifth legion did duty over against the midst of\r\nthe city, and whilst the tenth legion filled up the ditches and the\r\nvalleys. Now at this time it was that as king Agrippa was come nigh\r\nthe walls, and was endeavoring to speak to those that were on the walls\r\nabout a surrender, he was hit with a stone on his right elbow by one of\r\nthe slingers; he was then immediately surrounded with his own men. But\r\nthe Romans were excited to set about the siege, by their indignation\r\non the king's account, and by their fear on their own account, as\r\nconcluding that those men would omit no kinds of barbarity against\r\nforeigners and enemies, who where so enraged against one of their own\r\nnation, and one that advised them to nothing but what was for their own\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n4. Now when the banks were finished, which was done on the sudden, both\r\nby the multitude of hands, and by their being accustomed to such work,\r\nthey brought the machines; but Chares and Joseph, who were the most\r\npotent men in the city, set their armed men in order, though already\r\nin a fright, because they did not suppose that the city could hold out\r\nlong, since they had not a sufficient quantity either of water, or of\r\nother necessaries. However, these their leaders encouraged them, and\r\nbrought them out upon the wall, and for a while indeed they drove away\r\nthose that were bringing the machines; but when those machines threw\r\ndarts and stones at them, they retired into the city; then did the\r\nRomans bring battering rams to three several places, and made the wall\r\nshake [and fall]. They then poured in over the parts of the wall that\r\nwere thrown down, with a mighty sound of trumpets and noise of armor,\r\nand with a shout of the soldiers, and brake in by force upon those that\r\nwere in the city; but these men fell upon the Romans for some time, at\r\ntheir first entrance, and prevented their going any further, and with\r\ngreat courage beat them back; and the Romans were so overpowered by the\r\ngreater multitude of the people, who beat them on every side, that they\r\nwere obliged to run into the upper parts of the city. Whereupon the\r\npeople turned about, and fell upon their enemies, who had attacked them,\r\nand thrust them down to the lower parts, and as they were distressed\r\nby the narrowness and difficulty of the place, slew them; and as these\r\nRomans could neither beat those back that were above them, nor escape\r\nthe force of their own men that were forcing their way forward, they\r\nwere compelled to fly into their enemies' houses, which were low; but\r\nthese houses being thus full, of soldiers, whose weight they could not\r\nbear, fell down suddenly; and when one house fell, it shook down a great\r\nmany of those that were under it, as did those do to such as were under\r\nthem. By this means a vast number of the Romans perished; for they were\r\nso terribly distressed, that although they saw the houses subsiding,\r\nthey were compelled to leap upon the tops of them; so that a great many\r\nwere ground to powder by these ruins, and a great many of those that\r\ngot from under them lost some of their limbs, but still a greater number\r\nwere suffocated by the dust that arose from those ruins. The people\r\nof Gamala supposed this to be an assistance afforded them by God, and\r\nwithout regarding what damage they suffered themselves, they pressed\r\nforward, and thrust the enemy upon the tops of their houses; and when\r\nthey stumbled in the sharp and narrow streets, and were perpetually\r\nfalling down, they threw their stones or darts at them, and slew them.\r\nNow the very ruins afforded them stones enow; and for iron weapons,\r\nthe dead men of the enemies' side afforded them what they wanted; for\r\ndrawing the swords of those that were dead, they made use of them to\r\ndespatch such as were only half dead; nay, there were a great number\r\nwho, upon their falling down from the tops of the houses, stabbed\r\nthemselves, and died after that manner; nor indeed was it easy for those\r\nthat were beaten back to fly away; for they were so unacquainted with\r\nthe ways, and the dust was so thick, that they wandered about without\r\nknowing one another, and fell down dead among the crowd.\r\n\r\n5. Those therefore that were able to find the ways out of the city\r\nretired. But now Vespasian always staid among those that were hard set;\r\nfor he was deeply affected with seeing the ruins of the city falling\r\nupon his army, and forgot to take care of his own preservation. He went\r\nup gradually towards the highest parts of the city before he was aware,\r\nand was left in the midst of dangers, having only a very few with him;\r\nfor even his son Titus was not with him at that time, having been then\r\nsent into Syria to Mucianus. However, he thought it not safe to fly,\r\nnor did he esteem it a fit thing for him to do; but calling to mind the\r\nactions he had done from his youth, and recollecting his courage, as if\r\nhe had been excited by a divine fury, he covered himself and those that\r\nwere with him with their shields, and formed a testudo over both their\r\nbodies and their armor, and bore up against the enemy's attacks, who\r\ncame running down from the top of the city; and without showing any\r\ndread at the multitude of the men or of their darts, he endured all,\r\nuntil the enemy took notice of that divine courage that was within him,\r\nand remitted of their attacks; and when they pressed less zealously upon\r\nhim, he retired, though without showing his back to them till he was\r\ngotten out of the walls of the city. Now a great number of the Romans\r\nfell in this battle, among whom was Ebutius, the decurion, a man who\r\nappeared not only in this engagement, wherein he fell, but every where,\r\nand in former engagements, to be of the truest courage, and one that had\r\ndone very great mischief to the Jews. But there was a centurion whose\r\nname was Gallus, who, during this disorder, being encompassed about,\r\nhe and ten other soldiers privately crept into the house of a certain\r\nperson, where he heard them talking at supper, what the people intended\r\nto do against the Romans, or about themselves [for both the man himself\r\nand those with him were Syrians]. So he got up in the night time, and\r\ncut all their throats, and escaped, together with his soldiers, to the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n6. And now Vespasian comforted his army, which was much dejected by\r\nreflecting on their ill success, and because they had never before\r\nfallen into such a calamity, and besides this, because they were greatly\r\nashamed that they had left their general alone in great dangers. As to\r\nwhat concerned himself, he avoided to say any thing, that he might by\r\nno means seem to complain of it; but he said that \"we ought to bear\r\nmanfully what usually falls out in war, and this, by considering what\r\nthe nature of war is, and how it can never be that we must conquer\r\nwithout bloodshed on our own side; for there stands about us that\r\nfortune which is of its own nature mutable; that while they had killed\r\nso many ten thousands of the Jews, they had now paid their small share\r\nof the reckoning to fate; and as it is the part of weak people to be too\r\nmuch puffed up with good success, so is it the part of cowards to be too\r\nmuch affrighted at that which is ill; for the change from the one to the\r\nother is sudden on both sides; and he is the best warrior who is of a\r\nsober mind under misfortunes, that he may continue in that temper, and\r\ncheerfully recover what had been lost formerly; and as for what had now\r\nhappened, it was neither owing to their own effeminacy, nor to the valor\r\nof the Jews, but the difficulty of the place was the occasion of their\r\nadvantage, and of our disappointment. Upon reflecting on which matter\r\none might blame your zeal as perfectly ungovernable; for when the enemy\r\nhad retired to their highest fastnesses, you ought to have restrained\r\nyourselves, and not, by presenting yourselves at the top of the city, to\r\nbe exposed to dangers; but upon your having obtained the lower parts of\r\nthe city, you ought to have provoked those that had retired thither to\r\na safe and settled battle; whereas, in rushing so hastily upon victory,\r\nyou took no care of your safety. But this incautiousness in war, and\r\nthis madness of zeal, is not a Roman maxim. While we perform all that\r\nwe attempt by skill and good order, that procedure is the part of\r\nbarbarians, and is what the Jews chiefly support themselves by. We ought\r\ntherefore to return to our own virtue, and to be rather angry than any\r\nlonger dejected at this unlucky misfortune, and let every one seek for\r\nhis own consolation from his own hand; for by this means he will avenge\r\nthose that have been destroyed, and punish those that have killed them.\r\nFor myself, I will endeavor, as I have now done, to go first before\r\nyou against your enemies in every engagement, and to be the last that\r\nretires from it.\"\r\n\r\n7. So Vespasian encouraged his army by this speech; but for the people\r\nof Gamala, it happened that they took courage for a little while, upon\r\nsuch great and unaccountable success as they had had. But when they\r\nconsidered with themselves that they had now no hopes of any terms of\r\naccommodation, and reflecting upon it that they could not get away, and\r\nthat their provisions began already to be short, they were exceedingly\r\ncast down, and their courage failed them; yet did they not neglect what\r\nmight be for their preservation, so far as they were able, but the most\r\ncourageous among them guarded those parts of the wall that were beaten\r\ndown, while the more infirm did the same to the rest of the wall that\r\nstill remained round the city. And as the Romans raised their banks, and\r\nattempted to get into the city a second time, a great many of them fled\r\nout of the city through impracticable valleys, where no guards were\r\nplaced, as also through subterraneous caverns; while those that were\r\nafraid of being caught, and for that reason staid in the city, perished\r\nfor want of food; for what food they had was brought together from all\r\nquarters, and reserved for the fighting men.\r\n\r\n8. And these were the hard circumstances that the people of Gamala\r\nwere in. But now Vespasian went about other work by the by, during this\r\nsiege, and that was to subdue those that had seized upon Mount Tabor, a\r\nplace that lies in the middle between the great plain and Scythopolis,\r\nwhose top is elevated as high as thirty furlongs 2 and is hardly to be\r\nascended on its north side; its top is a plain of twenty-six furlongs,\r\nand all encompassed with a wall. Now Josephus erected this so long a\r\nwall in forty days' time, and furnished it with other materials, and\r\nwith water from below, for the inhabitants only made use of rain water.\r\nAs therefore there was a great multitude of people gotten together\r\nupon this mountain, Vespasian sent Placidus with six hundred horsemen\r\nthither. Now, as it was impossible for him to ascend the mountain, he\r\ninvited many of them to peace, by the offer of his right hand for their\r\nsecurity, and of his intercession for them. Accordingly they came down,\r\nbut with a treacherous design, as well as he had the like treacherous\r\ndesign upon them on the other side; for Placidus spoke mildly to them,\r\nas aiming to take them, when he got them into the plain; they also came\r\ndown, as complying with his proposals, but it was in order to fall upon\r\nhim when he was not aware of it: however, Placidus's stratagem was too\r\nhard for theirs; for when the Jews began to fight, he pretended to run\r\naway, and when they were in pursuit of the Romans, he enticed them\r\na great way along the plain, and then made his horsemen turn back;\r\nwhereupon he beat them, and slew a great number of them, and cut off the\r\nretreat of the rest of the multitude, and hindered their return. So they\r\nleft Tabor, and fled to Jerusalem, while the people of the country came\r\nto terms with him, for their water failed them, and so they delivered up\r\nthe mountain and themselves to Placidus.\r\n\r\n9. But of the people of Gamala, those that were of the bolder sort fled\r\naway and hid themselves, while the more infirm perished by famine; but\r\nthe men of war sustained the siege till the two and twentieth day of\r\nthe month Hyperbereteus, [Tisri,] when three soldiers of the fifteenth\r\nlegion, about the morning watch, got under a high tower that was near\r\nthem, and undermined it, without making any noise; nor when they either\r\ncame to it, which was in the night time, nor when they were under it,\r\ndid those that guarded it perceive them. These soldiers then upon their\r\ncoming avoided making a noise, and when they had rolled away five of its\r\nstrongest stones, they went away hastily; whereupon the tower fell down\r\non a sudden, with a very great noise, and its guard fell headlong\r\nwith it; so that those that kept guard at other places were under such\r\ndisturbance, that they ran away; the Romans also slew many of those that\r\nventured to oppose them, among whom was Joseph, who was slain by a dart,\r\nas he was running away over that part of the wall that was broken down:\r\nbut as those that were in the city were greatly affrighted at the noise,\r\nthey ran hither and thither, and a great consternation fell upon them,\r\nas though all the enemy had fallen in at once upon them. Then it was\r\nthat Chares, who was ill, and under the physician's hands, gave up the\r\nghost, the fear he was in greatly contributing to make his distemper\r\nfatal to him. But the Romans so well remembered their former ill\r\nsuccess, that they did not enter the city till the three and twentieth\r\nday of the forementioned month.\r\n\r\n10. At which time Titus, who was now returned, out of the indignation\r\nhe had at the destruction the Romans had undergone while he was absent,\r\ntook two hundred chosen horsemen and some footmen with him, and entered\r\nwithout noise into the city. Now as the watch perceived that he was\r\ncoming, they made a noise, and betook themselves to their arms; and as\r\nthat his entrance was presently known to those that were in the city,\r\nsome of them caught hold of their children and their wives, and drew\r\nthem after them, and fled away to the citadel, with lamentations\r\nand cries, while others of them went to meet Titus, and were killed\r\nperpetually; but so many of them as were hindered from running up to\r\nthe citadel, not knowing what in the world to do, fell among the Roman\r\nguards, while the groans of those that were killed were prodigiously\r\ngreat every where, and blood ran down over all the lower parts of the\r\ncity, from the upper. But then Vespasian himself came to his assistance\r\nagainst those that had fled to the citadel, and brought his whole army\r\nwith him; now this upper part of the city was every way rocky, and\r\ndifficult of ascent, and elevated to a vast altitude, and very full of\r\npeople on all sides, and encompassed with precipices, whereby the Jews\r\ncut off those that came up to them, and did much mischief to others\r\nby their darts, and the large stones which they rolled down upon them,\r\nwhile they were themselves so high that the enemy's darts could hardly\r\nreach them. However, there arose such a Divine storm against them as\r\nwas instrumental to their destruction; this carried the Roman darts\r\nupon them, and made those which they threw return back, and drove them\r\nobliquely away from them; nor could the Jews indeed stand upon their\r\nprecipices, by reason of the violence of the wind, having nothing that\r\nwas stable to stand upon, nor could they see those that were ascending\r\nup to them; so the Romans got up and surrounded them, and some they slew\r\nbefore they could defend themselves, and others as they were delivering\r\nup themselves; and the remembrance of those that were slain at their\r\nformer entrance into the city increased their rage against them now;\r\na great number also of those that were surrounded on every side,\r\nand despaired of escaping, threw their children and their wives, and\r\nthemselves also, down the precipices, into the valley beneath, which,\r\nnear the citadel, had been dug hollow to a vast depth; but so it\r\nhappened, that the anger of the Romans appeared not to be so extravagant\r\nas was the madness of those that were now taken, while the Romans\r\nslew but four thousand, whereas the number of those that had thrown\r\nthemselves down was found to be five thousand: nor did any one escape\r\nexcept two women, who were the daughters of Philip, and Philip himself\r\nwas the son of a certain eminent man called Jacimus, who had been\r\ngeneral of king Agrippa's army; and these did therefore escape, because\r\nthey lay concealed from the rage of the Romans when the city was taken;\r\nfor otherwise they spared not so much as the infants, of which many were\r\nflung down by them from the citadel. And thus was Gamala taken on the\r\nthree and twentieth day of the month Hyperbereteus, [Tisri,] whereas\r\nthe city had first revolted on the four and twentieth day of the month\r\nGorpieus [Elul].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Surrender Of Gischala; While John Flies Away From It To\r\n     Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1. Now no place of Galilee remained to be taken but the small city of\r\nGischala, whose multitude yet were desirous of peace; for they were\r\ngenerally husbandmen, and always applied themselves to cultivate the\r\nfruits of the earth. However, there were a great number that belonged to\r\na band of robbers, that were already corrupted, and had crept in among\r\nthem, and some of the governing part of the citizens were sick of the\r\nsame distemper. It was John, the son of a certain man whose name was\r\nLevi, that drew them into this rebellion, and encouraged them in it. He\r\nwas a cunning knave, and of a temper that could put on various shapes;\r\nvery rash in expecting great things, and very sagacious in bringing\r\nabout what he hoped for. It was known to every body that he was fond of\r\nwar, in order to thrust himself into authority; and the seditious part\r\nof the people of Gischala were under his management, by whose means the\r\npopulace, who seemed ready to send ambassadors in order to surrender,\r\nwaited for the coming of the Romans in battle-array. Vespasian sent\r\nagainst them Titus, with a thousand horsemen, but withdrew the tenth\r\nlegion to Scythopolis, while he returned to Cesarea with the two other\r\nlegions, that he might allow them to refresh themselves after their long\r\nand hard campaign, thinking withal that the plenty which was in those\r\ncities would improve their bodies and their spirits, against the\r\ndifficulties they were to go through afterwards; for he saw there would\r\nbe occasion for great pains about Jerusalem, which was not yet taken,\r\nbecause it was the royal city, and the principal city of the whole\r\nnation, and because those that had run away from the war in other places\r\ngot all together thither. It was also naturally strong, and the walls\r\nthat were built round it made him not a little concerned about it.\r\nMoreover, he esteemed the men that were in it to be so courageous and\r\nbold, that even without the consideration of the walls, it would be\r\nhard to subdue them; for which reason he took care of and exercised his\r\nsoldiers beforehand for the work, as they do wrestlers before they begin\r\ntheir undertaking.\r\n\r\n2. Now Titus, as he rode out to Gischala, found it would be easy for him\r\nto take the city upon the first onset; but knew withal, that if he took\r\nit by force, the multitude would be destroyed by the soldiers without\r\nmercy. [Now he was already satiated with the shedding of blood, and\r\npitied the major part, who would then perish, without distinction,\r\ntogether with the guilty.] So he was rather desirous the city might be\r\nsurrendered up to him on terms. Accordingly, when he saw the wall full\r\nof those men that were of the corrupted party, he said to them, That he\r\ncould not but wonder what it was they depended on, when they alone\r\nstaid to fight the Romans, after every other city was taken by them,\r\nespecially when they have seen cities much better fortified than theirs\r\nis overthrown by a single attack upon them; while as many as have\r\nintrusted themselves to the security of the Romans' right hands, which\r\nhe now offers to them, without regarding their former insolence, do\r\nenjoy their own possessions in safety; for that while they had hopes\r\nof recovering their liberty, they might be pardoned; but that their\r\ncontinuance still in their opposition, when they saw that to be\r\nimpossible, was inexcusable; for that if they will not comply with such\r\nhumane offers, and right hands for security, they should have experience\r\nof such a war as would spare nobody, and should soon be made sensible\r\nthat their wall would be but a trifle, when battered by the Roman\r\nmachines; in depending on which they demonstrate themselves to be the\r\nonly Galileans that were no better than arrogant slaves and captives.\r\n\r\n3. Now none of the populace durst not only make a reply, but durst not\r\nso much as get upon the wall, for it was all taken up by the robbers,\r\nwho were also the guard at the gates, in order to prevent any of the\r\nrest from going out, in order to propose terms of submission, and from\r\nreceiving any of the horsemen into the city. But John returned\r\nTitus this answer: That for himself he was content to hearken to his\r\nproposals, and that he would either persuade or force those that refused\r\nthem. Yet he said that Titus ought to have such regard to the Jewish\r\nlaw, as to grant them leave to celebrate that day, which was the seventh\r\nday of the week, on which it was unlawful not only to remove their\r\narms, but even to treat of peace also; and that even the Romans were not\r\nignorant how the period of the seventh day was among them a cessation\r\nfrom all labors; and that he who should compel them to transgress\r\nthe law about that day would be equally guilty with those that\r\nwere compelled to transgress it: and that this delay could be of no\r\ndisadvantage to him; for why should any body think of doing any thing in\r\nthe night, unless it was to fly away? which he might prevent by placing\r\nhis camp round about them; and that they should think it a great point\r\ngained, if they might not be obliged to transgress the laws of their\r\ncountry; and that it would be a right thing for him, who designed to\r\ngrant them peace, without their expectation of such a favor, to preserve\r\nthe laws of those they saved inviolable. Thus did this man put a trick\r\nupon Titus, not so much out of regard to the seventh day as to his own\r\npreservation, for he was afraid lest he should be quite deserted if the\r\ncity should be taken, and had his hopes of life in that night, and\r\nin his flight therein. Now this was the work of God, who therefore\r\npreserved this John, that he might bring on the destruction of\r\nJerusalem; as also it was his work that Titus was prevailed with by this\r\npretense for a delay, and that he pitched his camp further off the\r\ncity at Cydessa. This Cydessa was a strong Mediterranean village of the\r\nTyrians, which always hated and made war against the Jews; it had also\r\na great number of inhabitants, and was well fortified, which made it a\r\nproper place for such as were enemies to the Jewish nation.\r\n\r\n4. Now, in the night time, when John saw that there was no Roman guard\r\nabout the city, he seized the opportunity directly, and, taking with him\r\nnot only the armed men that were about him, but a considerable number\r\nof those that had little to do, together with their families, he fled to\r\nJerusalem. And indeed, though the man was making haste to get away, and\r\nwas tormented with fears of being a captive, or of losing his life, yet\r\ndid he prevail with himself to take out of the city along with him a\r\nmultitude of women and children, as far as twenty furlongs; but there he\r\nleft them as he proceeded further on his journey, where those that were\r\nleft behind made sad lamentations; for the farther every one of them was\r\ncome from his own people, the nearer they thought themselves to be to\r\ntheir enemies. They also affrighted themselves with this thought, that\r\nthose who would carry them into captivity were just at hand, and still\r\nturned themselves back at the mere noise they made themselves in this\r\ntheir hasty flight, as if those from whom they fled were just upon them.\r\nMany also of them missed their ways, and the earnestness of such as\r\naimed to outgo the rest threw down many of them. And indeed there was a\r\nmiserable destruction made of the women and children; while some of them\r\ntook courage to call their husbands and kinsmen back, and to beseech\r\nthem, with the bitterest lamentations, to stay for them; but John's\r\nexhortation, who cried out to them to save themselves, and fly away,\r\nprevailed. He said also, that if the Romans should seize upon those\r\nwhom they left behind, they would be revenged on them for it. So this\r\nmultitude that run thus away was dispersed abroad, according as each of\r\nthem was able to run, one faster or slower than another.\r\n\r\n5. Now on the next day Titus came to the wall, to make the agreement;\r\nwhereupon the people opened their gates to him, and came out to him,\r\nwith their children and wives, and made acclamations of joy to him, as\r\nto one that had been their benefactor, and had delivered the city out\r\nof custody; they also informed him of John's flight, and besought him\r\nto spare them, and to come in, and bring the rest of those that were\r\nfor innovations to punishment. But Titus, not so much regarding the\r\nsupplications of the people, sent part of his horsemen to pursue after\r\nJohn, but they could not overtake him, for he was gotten to Jerusalem\r\nbefore; they also slew six thousand of the women and children who went\r\nout with him, but returned back, and brought with them almost three\r\nthousand. However, Titus was greatly displeased that he had not been\r\nable to bring this John, who had deluded him, to punishment; yet he had\r\ncaptives enough, as well as the corrupted part of the city, to satisfy\r\nhis anger, when it missed of John. So he entered the city in the midst\r\nof acclamations of joy; and when he had given orders to the soldiers\r\nto pull down a small part of the wall, as of a city taken in war, he\r\nrepressed those that had disturbed the city rather by threatenings than\r\nby executions; for he thought that many would accuse innocent persons,\r\nout of their own private animosities and quarrels, if he should attempt\r\nto distinguish those that were worthy of punishment from the rest; and\r\nthat it was better to let a guilty person alone in his fears, that to\r\ndestroy with him any one that did not deserve it; for that probably such\r\na one might be taught prudence, by the fear of the punishment he had\r\ndeserved, and have a shame upon him for his former offenses, when he had\r\nbeen forgiven; but that the punishment of such as have been once put\r\nto death could never be retrieved. However, he placed a garrison in the\r\ncity for its security, by which means he should restrain those that were\r\nfor innovations, and should leave those that were peaceably disposed\r\nin greater security. And thus was all Galilee taken, but this not till\r\nafter it had cost the Romans much pains before it could be taken by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning John Of Gischala. Concerning The Zealots And The\r\n     High Priest Ananus; As Also How The Jews Raise Seditions One\r\n     Against Another [In Jerusalem].\r\n\r\n1. Now upon John's entry into Jerusalem, the whole body of the people\r\nwere in an uproar, and ten thousand of them crowded about every one of\r\nthe fugitives that were come to them, and inquired of them what miseries\r\nhad happened abroad, when their breath was so short, and hot, and quick,\r\nthat of itself it declared the great distress they were in; yet did they\r\ntalk big under their misfortunes, and pretended to say that they had not\r\nfled away from the Romans, but came thither in order to fight them with\r\nless hazard; for that it would be an unreasonable and a fruitless thing\r\nfor them to expose themselves to desperate hazards about Gischala, and\r\nsuch weak cities, whereas they ought to lay up their weapons and their\r\nzeal, and reserve it for their metropolis. But when they related to them\r\nthe taking of Gischala, and their decent departure, as they pretended,\r\nfrom that place, many of the people understood it to be no better than a\r\nflight; and especially when the people were told of those that were made\r\ncaptives, they were in great confusion, and guessed those things to be\r\nplain indications that they should be taken also. But for John, he was\r\nvery little concerned for those whom he had left behind him, but went\r\nabout among all the people, and persuaded them to go to war, by the\r\nhopes he gave them. He affirmed that the affairs of the Romans were in\r\na weak condition, and extolled his own power. He also jested upon the\r\nignorance of the unskillful, as if those Romans, although they should\r\ntake to themselves wings, could never fly over the wall of Jerusalem,\r\nwho found such great difficulties in taking the villages of Galilee, and\r\nhad broken their engines of war against their walls.\r\n\r\n2. These harangues of John's corrupted a great part of the young men,\r\nand puffed them up for the war; but as to the more prudent part, and\r\nthose in years, there was not a man of them but foresaw what was coming,\r\nand made lamentation on that account, as if the city was already undone;\r\nand in this confusion were the people. But then it must be observed,\r\nthat the multitude that came out of the country were at discord before\r\nthe Jerusalem sedition began; for Titus went from Gischala to Cesates,\r\nand Vespasian from Cesarea to Jamnia and Azotus, and took them both; and\r\nwhen he had put garrisons into them, he came back with a great number\r\nof the people, who were come over to him, upon his giving them his right\r\nhand for their preservation. There were besides disorders and civil wars\r\nin every city; and all those that were at quiet from the Romans turned\r\ntheir hands one against another. There was also a bitter contest between\r\nthose that were fond of war, and those that were desirous for peace. At\r\nthe first this quarrelsome temper caught hold of private families, who\r\ncould not agree among themselves; after which those people that were the\r\ndearest to one another brake through all restraints with regard to each\r\nother, and every one associated with those of his own opinion, and began\r\nalready to stand in opposition one to another; so that seditions arose\r\nevery where, while those that were for innovations, and were desirous of\r\nwar, by their youth and boldness, were too hard for the aged and prudent\r\nmen. And, in the first place, all the people of every place betook\r\nthemselves to rapine; after which they got together in bodies, in\r\norder to rob the people of the country, insomuch that for barbarity and\r\niniquity those of the same nation did no way differ from the Romans;\r\nnay, it seemed to be a much lighter thing to be ruined by the Romans\r\nthan by themselves.\r\n\r\n3. Now the Roman garrisons, which guarded the cities, partly out of\r\ntheir uneasiness to take such trouble upon them, and partly out of the\r\nhatred they bare to the Jewish nation, did little or nothing towards\r\nrelieving the miserable, till the captains of these troops of robbers,\r\nbeing satiated with rapines in the country, got all together from all\r\nparts, and became a band of wickedness, and all together crept into\r\nJerusalem, which was now become a city without a governor, and, as the\r\nancient custom was, received without distinction all that belonged to\r\ntheir nation; and these they then received, because all men supposed\r\nthat those who came so fast into the city came out of kindness, and for\r\ntheir assistance, although these very men, besides the seditions they\r\nraised, were otherwise the direct cause of the city's destruction also;\r\nfor as they were an unprofitable and a useless multitude, they spent\r\nthose provisions beforehand which might otherwise have been sufficient\r\nfor the fighting men. Moreover, besides the bringing on of the war, they\r\nwere the occasions of sedition and famine therein.\r\n\r\n4. There were besides these other robbers that came out of the country,\r\nand came into the city, and joining to them those that were worse than\r\nthemselves, omitted no kind of barbarity; for they did not measure their\r\ncourage by their rapines and plunderings only, but preceded as far as\r\nmurdering men; and this not in the night time or privately, or with\r\nregard to ordinary men, but did it openly in the day time, and began\r\nwith the most eminent persons in the city; for the first man they\r\nmeddled with was Antipas, one of the royal lineage, and the most potent\r\nman in the whole city, insomuch that the public treasures were committed\r\nto his care; him they took and confined; as they did in the next place\r\nto Levias, a person of great note, with Sophas, the son of Raguel, both\r\nwhich were of royal lineage also. And besides these, they did the\r\nsame to the principal men of the country. This caused a terrible\r\nconsternation among the people, and everyone contented himself with\r\ntaking care of his own safety, as they would do if the city had been\r\ntaken in war.\r\n\r\n5. But these were not satisfied with the bonds into which they had put\r\nthe men forementioned; nor did they think it safe for them to keep\r\nthem thus in custody long, since they were men very powerful, and had\r\nnumerous families of their own that were able to avenge them. Nay,\r\nthey thought the very people would perhaps be so moved at these unjust\r\nproceedings, as to rise in a body against them; it was therefore\r\nresolved to have them slain accordingly, they sent one John, who was the\r\nmost bloody-minded of them all, to do that execution: this man was also\r\ncalled \"the son of Dorcas,\" 3 in the language of our country. Ten more\r\nmen went along with him into the prison, with their swords drawn, and\r\nso they cut the throats of those that were in custody there. The grand\r\nlying pretence these men made for so flagrant an enormity was this,\r\nthat these men had had conferences with the Romans for a surrender of\r\nJerusalem to them; and so they said they had slain only such as were\r\ntraitors to their common liberty. Upon the whole, they grew the more\r\ninsolent upon this bold prank of theirs, as though they had been the\r\nbenefactors and saviors of the city.\r\n\r\n6. Now the people were come to that degree of meanness and fear, and\r\nthese robbers to that degree of madness, that these last took upon them\r\nto appoint high priests. 4 So when they had disannulled the succession,\r\naccording to those families out of which the high priests used to be\r\nmade, they ordained certain unknown and ignoble persons for that office,\r\nthat they might have their assistance in their wicked undertakings; for\r\nsuch as obtained this highest of all honors, without any desert, were\r\nforced to comply with those that bestowed it on them. They also set\r\nthe principal men at variance one with another, by several sorts of\r\ncontrivances and tricks, and gained the opportunity of doing what they\r\npleased, by the mutual quarrels of those who might have obstructed\r\ntheir measures; till at length, when they were satiated with the unjust\r\nactions they had done towards men, they transferred their contumelious\r\nbehavior to God himself, and came into the sanctuary with polluted feet.\r\n\r\n7. And now the multitude were going to rise against them already; for\r\nAnanus, the ancientest of the high priests, persuaded them to it. He was\r\na very prudent man, and had perhaps saved the city if he could but have\r\nescaped the hands of those that plotted against him. These men made the\r\ntemple of God a strong hold for them, and a place whither they might\r\nresort, in order to avoid the troubles they feared from the people;\r\nthe sanctuary was now become a refuge, and a shop of tyranny. They\r\nalso mixed jesting among the miseries they introduced, which was more\r\nintolerable than what they did; for in order to try what surprise\r\nthe people would be under, and how far their own power extended, they\r\nundertook to dispose of the high priesthood by casting lots for it,\r\nwhereas, as we have said already, it was to descend by succession in a\r\nfamily. The pretense they made for this strange attempt was an ancient\r\npractice, while they said that of old it was determined by lot; but in\r\ntruth, it was no better than a dissolution of an undeniable law, and\r\na cunning contrivance to seize upon the government, derived from those\r\nthat presumed to appoint governors as they themselves pleased.\r\n\r\n8. Hereupon they sent for one of the pontifical tribes, which is called\r\nEniachim, 5 and cast lots which of it should be the high priest. By\r\nfortune the lot so fell as to demonstrate their iniquity after the\r\nplainest manner, for it fell upon one whose name was Phannias, the son\r\nof Samuel, of the village Aphtha. He was a man not only unworthy of the\r\nhigh priesthood, but that did not well know what the high priesthood\r\nwas, such a mere rustic was he! yet did they hail this man, without his\r\nown consent, out of the country, as if they were acting a play upon the\r\nstage, and adorned him with a counterfeit tree; they also put upon him\r\nthe sacred garments, and upon every occasion instructed him what he was\r\nto do. This horrid piece of wickedness was sport and pastime with them,\r\nbut occasioned the other priests, who at a distance saw their law made\r\na jest of, to shed tears, and sorely lament the dissolution of such a\r\nsacred dignity.\r\n\r\n9. And now the people could no longer bear the insolence of this\r\nprocedure, but did all together run zealously, in order to overthrow\r\nthat tyranny; and indeed they were Gorion the son of Josephus, and\r\nSymeon the son of Gamaliel, 6 who encouraged them, by going up and down\r\nwhen they were assembled together in crowds, and as they saw them\r\nalone, to bear no longer, but to inflict punishment upon these pests\r\nand plagues of their freedom, and to purge the temple of these bloody\r\npolluters of it. The best esteemed also of the high priests, Jesus the\r\nson of Gamalas, and Ananus the son of Ananus when they were at their\r\nassemblies, bitterly reproached the people for their sloth, and excited\r\nthem against the zealots; for that was the name they went by, as if they\r\nwere zealous in good undertakings, and were not rather zealous in the\r\nworst actions, and extravagant in them beyond the example of others.\r\n\r\n10. And now, when the multitude were gotten together to an assembly, and\r\nevery one was in indignation at these men's seizing upon the sanctuary,\r\nat their rapine and murders, but had not yet begun their attacks upon\r\nthem, [the reason of which was this, that they imagined it to be a\r\ndifficult thing to suppress these zealots, as indeed the case was,]\r\nAnanus stood in the midst of them, and casting his eyes frequently at\r\nthe temple, and having a flood of tears in his eyes, he said, \"Certainly\r\nit had been good for me to die before I had seen the house of God full\r\nof so many abominations, or these sacred places, that ought not to be\r\ntrodden upon at random, filled with the feet of these blood-shedding\r\nvillains; yet do I, who am clothed with the vestments of the high\r\npriesthood, and am called by that most venerable name [of high priest],\r\nstill live, and am but too fond of living, and cannot endure to undergo\r\na death which would be the glory of my old age; and if I were the only\r\nperson concerned, and as it were in a desert, I would give up my life,\r\nand that alone for God's sake; for to what purpose is it to live among\r\na people insensible of their calamities, and where there is no notion\r\nremaining of any remedy for the miseries that are upon them? for when\r\nyou are seized upon, you bear it! and when you are beaten, you are\r\nsilent! and when the people are murdered, nobody dare so much as send\r\nout a groan openly! O bitter tyranny that we are under! But why do I\r\ncomplain of the tyrants? Was it not you, and your sufferance of them,\r\nthat have nourished them? Was it not you that overlooked those that\r\nfirst of all got together, for they were then but a few, and by your\r\nsilence made them grow to be many; and by conniving at them when they\r\ntook arms, in effect armed them against yourselves? You ought to have\r\nthen prevented their first attempts, when they fell a reproaching your\r\nrelations; but by neglecting that care in time, you have encouraged\r\nthese wretches to plunder men. When houses were pillaged, nobody said\r\na word, which was the occasion why they carried off the owners of those\r\nhouses; and when they were drawn through the midst of the city, nobody\r\ncame to their assistance. They then proceeded to put those whom you have\r\nbetrayed into their hands into bonds. I do not say how many and of what\r\ncharacters those men were whom they thus served; but certainly they were\r\nsuch as were accused by none, and condemned by none; and since nobody\r\nsuccored them when they were put into bonds, the consequence was, that\r\nyou saw the same persons slain. We have seen this also; so that still\r\nthe best of the herd of brute animals, as it were, have been still led\r\nto be sacrificed, when yet nobody said one word, or moved his right hand\r\nfor their preservation. Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see\r\nyour sanctuary trampled on? and will you lay steps for these profane\r\nwretches, upon which they may mount to higher degrees of insolence? Will\r\nnot you pluck them down from their exaltation? for even by this time\r\nthey had proceeded to higher enormities, if they had been able to\r\noverthrow any thing greater than the sanctuary. They have seized upon\r\nthe strongest place of the whole city; you may call it the temple, if\r\nyou please, though it be like a citadel or fortress. Now, while you have\r\ntyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your\r\nheads, to what purpose is it to take counsel? and what have you to\r\nsupport your minds withal? Perhaps you wait for the Romans, that they\r\nmay protect our holy places: are our matters then brought to that pass?\r\nand are we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves\r\nare expected to pity us? O wretched creatures! will not you rise up and\r\nturn upon those that strike you? which you may observe in wild beasts\r\nthemselves, that they will avenge themselves on those that strike\r\nthem. Will you not call to mind, every one of you, the calamities you\r\nyourselves have suffered? nor lay before your eyes what afflictions you\r\nyourselves have undergone? and will not such things sharpen your souls\r\nto revenge? Is therefore that most honorable and most natural of our\r\npassions utterly lost, I mean the desire of liberty? Truly we are in\r\nlove with slavery, and in love with those that lord it over us, as if\r\nwe had received that principle of subjection from our ancestors; yet did\r\nthey undergo many and great wars for the sake of liberty, nor were they\r\nso far overcome by the power of the Egyptians, or the Medes, but that\r\nstill they did what they thought fit, notwithstanding their commands to\r\nthe contrary. And what occasion is there now for a war with the Romans?\r\n[I meddle not with determining whether it be an advantageous and\r\nprofitable war or not.] What pretense is there for it? Is it not that\r\nwe may enjoy our liberty? Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the\r\nhabitable earth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own\r\ncountry? Although I must say that submission to foreigners may be borne,\r\nbecause fortune hath already doomed us to it, while submission to wicked\r\npeople of our own nation is too unmanly, and brought upon us by our own\r\nconsent. However, since I have had occasion to mention the Romans, I\r\nwill not conceal a thing that, as I am speaking, comes into my mind, and\r\naffects me considerably; it is this, that though we should be taken by\r\nthem, [God forbid the event should be so!] yet can we undergo nothing\r\nthat will be harder to be borne than what these men have already brought\r\nupon us. How then can we avoid shedding of tears, when we see the Roman\r\ndonations in our temple, while we withal see those of our own nation\r\ntaking our spoils, and plundering our glorious metropolis, and\r\nslaughtering our men, from which enormities those Romans themselves\r\nwould have abstained? to see those Romans never going beyond the bounds\r\nallotted to profane persons, nor venturing to break in upon any of our\r\nsacred customs; nay, having a horror on their minds when they view at a\r\ndistance those sacred walls; while some that have been born in this very\r\ncountry, and brought up in our customs, and called Jews, do walk about\r\nin the midst of the holy places, at the very time when their hands are\r\nstill warm with the slaughter of their own countrymen. Besides, can\r\nany one be afraid of a war abroad, and that with such as will have\r\ncomparatively much greater moderation than our own people have? For\r\ntruly, if we may suit our words to the things they represent, it is\r\nprobable one may hereafter find the Romans to be the supporters of our\r\nlaws, and those within ourselves the subverters of them. And now I am\r\npersuaded that every one of you here comes satisfied before I speak that\r\nthese overthrowers of our liberties deserve to be destroyed, and that\r\nnobody can so much as devise a punishment that they have not deserved by\r\nwhat they have done, and that you are all provoked against them by those\r\ntheir wicked actions, whence you have suffered so greatly. But perhaps\r\nmany of you are affrighted at the multitude of those zealots, and at\r\ntheir audaciousness, as well as at the advantage they have over us in\r\ntheir being higher in place than we are; for these circumstances, as\r\nthey have been occasioned by your negligence, so will they become still\r\ngreater by being still longer neglected; for their multitude is every\r\nday augmented, by every ill man's running away to those that are like to\r\nthemselves, and their audaciousness is therefore inflamed, because they\r\nmeet with no obstruction to their designs. And for their higher place,\r\nthey will make use of it for engines also, if we give them time to do\r\nso; but be assured of this, that if we go up to fight them, they will\r\nbe made tamer by their own consciences, and what advantages they have in\r\nthe height of their situation they will lose by the opposition of their\r\nreason; perhaps also God himself, who hath been affronted by them, will\r\nmake what they throw at us return against themselves, and these\r\nimpious wretches will be killed by their own darts: let us but make our\r\nappearance before them, and they will come to nothing. However, it is a\r\nright thing, if there should be any danger in the attempt, to die before\r\nthese holy gates, and to spend our very lives, if not for the sake of\r\nour children and wives, yet for God's sake, and for the sake of his\r\nsanctuary. I will assist you both with my counsel and with my hand; nor\r\nshall any sagacity of ours be wanting for your support; nor shall you\r\nsee that I will be sparing of my body neither.\"\r\n\r\n11. By these motives Ananus encouraged the multitude to go against the\r\nzealots, although he knew how difficult it would be to disperse them,\r\nbecause of their multitude, and their youth, and the courage of their\r\nsouls; but chiefly because of their consciousness of what they had done,\r\nsince they would not yield, as not so much as hoping for pardon at the\r\nlast for those their enormities. However, Ananus resolved to undergo\r\nwhatever sufferings might come upon him, rather than overlook things,\r\nnow they were in such great confusion. So the multitude cried out\r\nto him, to lead them on against those whom he had described in his\r\nexhortation to them, and every one of them was most readily disposed to\r\nrun any hazard whatsoever on that account.\r\n\r\n12. Now while Ananus was choosing out his men, and putting those that\r\nwere proper for his purpose in array for fighting, the zealots got\r\ninformation of his undertaking, [for there were some who went to them,\r\nand told them all that the people were doing,] and were irritated at\r\nit, and leaping out of the temple in crowds, and by parties, spared none\r\nwhom they met with. Upon this Ananus got the populace together on the\r\nsudden, who were more numerous indeed than the zealots, but inferior\r\nto them in arms, because they had not been regularly put into array for\r\nfighting; but the alacrity that every body showed supplied all their\r\ndefects on both sides, the citizens taking up so great a passion as was\r\nstronger than arms, and deriving a degree of courage from the temple\r\nmore forcible than any multitude whatsoever; and indeed these citizens\r\nthought it was not possible for them to dwell in the city, unless they\r\ncould cut off the robbers that were in it. The zealots also thought that\r\nunless they prevailed, there would be no punishment so bad but it\r\nwould be inflicted on them. So their conflicts were conducted by their\r\npassions; and at the first they only cast stones at each other in the\r\ncity, and before the temple, and threw their javelins at a distance; but\r\nwhen either of them were too hard for the other, they made use of their\r\nswords; and great slaughter was made on both sides, and a great number\r\nwere wounded. As for the dead bodies of the people, their relations\r\ncarried them out to their own houses; but when any of the zealots were\r\nwounded, he went up into the temple, and defiled that sacred floor\r\nwith his blood, insomuch that one may say it was their blood alone\r\nthat polluted our sanctuary. Now in these conflicts the robbers always\r\nsallied out of the temple, and were too hard for their enemies; but\r\nthe populace grew very angry, and became more and more numerous, and\r\nreproached those that gave back, and those behind would not afford room\r\nto those that were going off, but forced them on again, till at length\r\nthey made their whole body to turn against their adversaries, and the\r\nrobbers could no longer oppose them, but were forced gradually to retire\r\ninto the temple; when Ananus and his party fell into it at the same time\r\ntogether with them. 7 This horribly affrighted the robbers, because\r\nit deprived them of the first court; so they fled into the inner court\r\nimmediately, and shut the gates. Now Ananus did not think fit to make\r\nany attack against the holy gates, although the other threw their stones\r\nand darts at them from above. He also deemed it unlawful to introduce\r\nthe multitude into that court before they were purified; he therefore\r\nchose out of them all by lot six thousand armed men, and placed them as\r\nguards in the cloisters; so there was a succession of such guards\r\none after another, and every one was forced to attend in his course;\r\nalthough many of the chief of the city were dismissed by those that then\r\ntook on them the government, upon their hiring some of the poorer sort,\r\nand sending them to keep the guard in their stead.\r\n\r\n13. Now it was John who, as we told you, ran away from Gischala, and was\r\nthe occasion of all these being destroyed. He was a man of great craft,\r\nand bore about him in his soul a strong passion after tyranny, and at\r\na distance was the adviser in these actions; and indeed at this time he\r\npretended to be of the people's opinion, and went all about with Ananus\r\nwhen he consulted the great men every day, and in the night time also\r\nwhen he went round the watch; but he divulged their secrets to the\r\nzealots, and every thing that the people deliberated about was by his\r\nmeans known to their enemies, even before it had been well agreed upon\r\nby themselves. And by way of contrivance how he might not be brought\r\ninto suspicion, he cultivated the greatest friendship possible with\r\nAnanus, and with the chief of the people; yet did this overdoing of his\r\nturn against him, for he flattered them so extravagantly, that he was\r\nbut the more suspected; and his constant attendance every where, even\r\nwhen he was not invited to be present, made him strongly suspected of\r\nbetraying their secrets to the enemy; for they plainly perceived\r\nthat they understood all the resolutions taken against them at their\r\nconsultations. Nor was there any one whom they had so much reason to\r\nsuspect of that discovery as this John; yet was it not easy to get quit\r\nof him, so potent was he grown by his wicked practices. He was also\r\nsupported by many of those eminent men, who were to be consulted upon\r\nall considerable affairs; it was therefore thought reasonable to oblige\r\nhim to give them assurance of his good-will upon oath; accordingly John\r\ntook such an oath readily, that he would be on the people's side, and\r\nwould not betray any of their counsels or practices to their enemies,\r\nand would assist them in overthrowing those that attacked them, and that\r\nboth by his hand and his advice. So Ananus and his party believed his\r\noath, and did now receive him to their consultations without further\r\nsuspicion; nay, so far did they believe him, that they sent him as\r\ntheir ambassador into the temple to the zealots, with proposals of\r\naccommodation; for they were very desirous to avoid the pollution of the\r\ntemple as much as they possibly could, and that no one of their nation\r\nshould be slain therein.\r\n\r\n14. But now this John, as if his oath had been made to the zealots, and\r\nfor confirmation of his good-will to them, and not against them, went\r\ninto the temple, and stood in the midst of them, and spake as follows:\r\nThat he had run many hazards on their accounts, and in order to let them\r\nknow of every thing that was secretly contrived against them by Ananus\r\nand his party; but that both he and they should be cast into the most\r\nimminent danger, unless some providential assistance were afforded them;\r\nfor that Ananus made no longer delay, but had prevailed with the people\r\nto send ambassadors to Vespasian, to invite him to come presently and\r\ntake the city; and that he had appointed a fast for the next day against\r\nthem, that they might obtain admission into the temple on a religious\r\naccount, or gain it by force, and fight with them there; that he did not\r\nsee how long they could either endure a siege, or how they could fight\r\nagainst so many enemies. He added further, that it was by the\r\nprovidence of God he was himself sent as an ambassador to them for an\r\naccommodation; for that Artanus did therefore offer them such proposals,\r\nthat he might come upon them when they were unarmed; that they ought\r\nto choose one of these two methods, either to intercede with those that\r\nguarded them, to save their lives, or to provide some foreign assistance\r\nfor themselves; that if they fostered themselves with the hopes of\r\npardon, in case they were subdued, they had forgotten what desperate\r\nthings they had done, or could suppose, that as soon as the actors\r\nrepented, those that had suffered by them must be presently reconciled\r\nto them; while those that have done injuries, though they pretend to\r\nrepent of them, are frequently hated by the others for that sort of\r\nrepentance; and that the sufferers, when they get the power into their\r\nhands, are usually still more severe upon the actors; that the friends\r\nand kindred of those that had been destroyed would always be laying\r\nplots against them; and that a large body of people were very angry\r\non account of their gross breaches of their laws, and [illegal]\r\njudicatures, insomuch that although some part might commiserate them,\r\nthose would be quite overborne by the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Idumeans Being Sent For By The Zealots, Came Immediately\r\n     To Jerusalem; And When They Were Excluded Out Of The City,\r\n     They Lay All Night There. Jesus One Of The High Priests\r\n     Makes A Speech To Them; And Simon The Idumean Makes A Reply\r\n     To It.\r\n\r\n1. Now, by this crafty speech, John made the zealots afraid; yet durst\r\nhe not directly name what foreign assistance he meant, but in a covert\r\nway only intimated at the Idumeans. But now, that he might particularly\r\nirritate the leaders of the zealots, he calumniated Ananus, that he was\r\nabout a piece of barbarity, and did in a special manner threaten them.\r\nThese leaders were Eleazar, the son of Simon, who seemed the most\r\nplausible man of them all, both in considering what was fit to be done,\r\nand in the execution of what he had determined upon, and Zacharias, the\r\nson of Phalek; both of whom derived their families from the priests.\r\nNow when these two men had heard, not only the common threatenings which\r\nbelonged to them all, but those peculiarly leveled against themselves;\r\nand besides, how Artanus and his party, in order to secure their own\r\ndominion, had invited the Romans to come to them, for that also was\r\npart of John's lie; they hesitated a great while what they should do,\r\nconsidering the shortness of the time by which they were straitened;\r\nbecause the people were prepared to attack them very soon, and because\r\nthe suddenness of the plot laid against them had almost cut off all\r\ntheir hopes of getting any foreign assistance; for they might be under\r\nthe height of their afflictions before any of their confederates could\r\nbe informed of it. However, it was resolved to call in the Idumeans; so\r\nthey wrote a short letter to this effect: That Ananus had imposed on\r\nthe people, and was betraying their metropolis to the Romans; that\r\nthey themselves had revolted from the rest, and were in custody in the\r\ntemple, on account of the preservation of their liberty; that there was\r\nbut a small time left wherein they might hope for their deliverance; and\r\nthat unless they would come immediately to their assistance, they should\r\nthemselves be soon in the power of Artanus, and the city would be in the\r\npower of the Romans. They also charged the messengers to tell many more\r\ncircumstances to the rulers of the Idumeans. Now there were two active\r\nmen proposed for the carrying this message, and such as were able to\r\nspeak, and to persuade them that things were in this posture, and, what\r\nwas a qualification still more necessary than the former, they were very\r\nswift of foot; for they knew well enough that these would immediately\r\ncomply with their desires, as being ever a tumultuous and disorderly\r\nnation, always on the watch upon every motion, delighting in mutations;\r\nand upon your flattering them ever so little, and petitioning them, they\r\nsoon take their arms, and put themselves into motion, and make haste to\r\na battle, as if it were to a feast. There was indeed occasion for quick\r\ndespatch in the carrying of this message, in which point the messengers\r\nwere no way defective. Both their names were Ananias; and they soon came\r\nto the rulers of the Idumeans.\r\n\r\n2. Now these rulers were greatly surprised at the contents of the\r\nletter, and at what those that came with it further told them; whereupon\r\nthey ran about the nation like madmen, and made proclamation that the\r\npeople should come to war; so a multitude was suddenly got together,\r\nsooner indeed than the time appointed in the proclamation, and every\r\nbody caught up their arms, in order to maintain the liberty of their\r\nmetropolis; and twenty thousand of them were put into battle-array, and\r\ncame to Jerusalem, under four commanders, John, and Jacob the son of\r\nSosas; and besides these were Simon, the son of Cathlas, and Phineas,\r\nthe son of Clusothus.\r\n\r\n3. Now this exit of the messengers was not known either to Ananus or to\r\nthe guards, but the approach of the Idumeans was known to him; for as\r\nhe knew of it before they came, he ordered the gates to be shut against\r\nthem, and that the walls should be guarded. Yet did not he by any means\r\nthink of fighting against them, but, before they came to blows, to try\r\nwhat persuasions would do. Accordingly, Jesus, the eldest of the high\r\npriests next to Artanus, stood upon the tower that was over against\r\nthem, and said thus: \"Many troubles indeed, and those of various kinds,\r\nhave fallen upon this city, yet in none of them have I so much wondered\r\nat her fortune as now, when you are come to assist wicked men, and\r\nthis after a manner very extraordinary; for I see that you are come to\r\nsupport the vilest of men against us, and this with so great alacrity,\r\nas you could hardly put on the like, in case our metropolis had called\r\nyou to her assistance against barbarians. And if I had perceived that\r\nyour army was composed of men like unto those who invited them, I had\r\nnot deemed your attempt so absurd; for nothing does so much cement the\r\nminds of men together as the alliance there is between their manners.\r\nBut now for these men who have invited you, if you were to examine\r\nthem one by one, every one of them would be found to have deserved ten\r\nthousand deaths; for the very rascality and offscouring of the whole\r\ncountry, who have spent in debauchery their own substance, and, by way\r\nof trial beforehand, have madly plundered the neighboring villages and\r\ncities, in the upshot of all, have privately run together into this holy\r\ncity. They are robbers, who by their prodigious wickedness have profaned\r\nthis most sacred floor, and who are to be now seen drinking themselves\r\ndrunk in the sanctuary, and expending the spoils of those whom they have\r\nslaughtered upon their unsatiable bellies. As for the multitude that\r\nis with you, one may see them so decently adorned in their armor, as\r\nit would become them to be had their metropolis called them to her\r\nassistance against foreigners. What can a man call this procedure of\r\nyours but the sport of fortune, when he sees a whole nation coming to\r\nprotect a sink of wicked wretches? I have for a good while been in doubt\r\nwhat it could possibly be that should move you to do this so suddenly;\r\nbecause certainly you would not take on your armor on the behalf of\r\nrobbers, and against a people of kin to you, without some very great\r\ncause for your so doing. But we have an item that the Romans are\r\npretended, and that we are supposed to be going to betray this city\r\nto them; for some of your men have lately made a clamor about those\r\nmatters, and have said they are come to set their metropolis free. Now\r\nwe cannot but admire at these wretches in their devising such a lie\r\nas this against us; for they knew there was no other way to irritate\r\nagainst us men that were naturally desirous of liberty, and on that\r\naccount the best disposed to fight against foreign enemies, but by\r\nframing a tale as if we were going to betray that most desirable thing,\r\nliberty. But you ought to consider what sort of people they are that\r\nraise this calumny, and against what sort of people that calumny is\r\nraised, and to gather the truth of things, not by fictitious speeches,\r\nbut out of the actions of both parties; for what occasion is there for\r\nus to sell ourselves to the Romans, while it was in our power not to\r\nhave revolted from them at the first, or when we had once revolted, to\r\nhave returned under their dominion again, and this while the neighboring\r\ncountries were not yet laid waste? whereas it is not an easy thing to\r\nbe reconciled to the Romans, if we were desirous of it, now they have\r\nsubdued Galilee, and are thereby become proud and insolent; and to\r\nendeavor to please them at the time when they are so near us, would\r\nbring such a reproach upon us as were worse than death. As for myself,\r\nindeed, I should have preferred peace with them before death; but now we\r\nhave once made war upon them, and fought with them, I prefer death, with\r\nreputation, before living in captivity under them. But further, whether\r\ndo they pretend that we, who are the rulers of the people, have sent\r\nthus privately to the Romans, or hath it been done by the common\r\nsuffrages of the people? If it be ourselves only that have done it, let\r\nthem name those friends of ours that have been sent, as our servants, to\r\nmanage this treachery. Hath any one been caught as he went out on this\r\nerrand, or seized upon as he came back? Are they in possession of our\r\nletters? How could we be concealed from such a vast number of our fellow\r\ncitizens, among whom we are conversant every hour, while what is done\r\nprivately in the country is, it seems, known by the zealots, who are but\r\nfew in number, and under confinement also, and are not able to come out\r\nof the temple into the city. Is this the first time that they are become\r\nsensible how they ought to be punished for their insolent actions? For\r\nwhile these men were free from the fear they are now under, there was\r\nno suspicion raised that any of us were traitors. But if they lay\r\nthis charge against the people, this must have been done at a public\r\nconsultation, and not one of the people must have dissented from the\r\nrest of the assembly; in which case the public fame of this matter would\r\nhave come to you sooner than any particular indication. But how could\r\nthat be? Must there not then have been ambassadors sent to confirm\r\nthe agreements? And let them tell us who this ambassador was that was\r\nordained for that purpose. But this is no other than a pretense of such\r\nmen as are loath to die, and are laboring to escape those punishments\r\nthat hang over them; for if fate had determined that this city was to be\r\nbetrayed into its enemies' hands, no other than these men that accuse\r\nus falsely could have the impudence to do it, there being no wickedness\r\nwanting to complete their impudent practices but this only, that they\r\nbecome traitors. And now you Idumeans are come hither already with\r\nyour arms, it is your duty, in the first place, to be assisting to your\r\nmetropolis, and to join with us in cutting off those tyrants that have\r\ninfringed the rules of our regular tribunals, that have trampled upon\r\nour laws, and made their swords the arbitrators of right and wrong; for\r\nthey have seized upon men of great eminence, and under no accusation,\r\nas they stood in the midst of the market-place, and tortured them with\r\nputting them into bonds, and, without bearing to hear what they had to\r\nsay, or what supplications they made, they destroyed them. You may, if\r\nyou please, come into the city, though not in the way of war, and take\r\na view of the marks still remaining of what I now say, and may see the\r\nhouses that have been depopulated by their rapacious hands, with those\r\nwives and families that are in black, mourning for their slaughtered\r\nrelations; as also you may hear their groans and lamentations all the\r\ncity over; for there is nobody but hath tasted of the incursions of\r\nthese profane wretches, who have proceeded to that degree of madness,\r\nas not only to have transferred their impudent robberies out of the\r\ncountry, and the remote cities, into this city, the very face and head\r\nof the whole nation, but out of the city into the temple also; for that\r\nis now made their receptacle and refuge, and the fountain-head whence\r\ntheir preparations are made against us. And this place, which is adored\r\nby the habitable world, and honored by such as only know it by report,\r\nas far as the ends of the earth, is trampled upon by these wild beasts\r\nborn among ourselves. They now triumph in the desperate condition they\r\nare already in, when they hear that one people is going to fight against\r\nanother people, and one city against another city, and that your nation\r\nhath gotten an army together against its own bowels. Instead of which\r\nprocedure, it were highly fit and reasonable, as I said before, for you\r\nto join with us in cutting off these wretches, and in particular to\r\nbe revenged on them for putting this very cheat upon you; I mean, for\r\nhaving the impudence to invite you to assist them, of whom they ought to\r\nhave stood in fear, as ready to punish them. But if you have some regard\r\nto these men's invitation of you, yet may you lay aside your arms, and\r\ncome into the city under the notion of our kindred, and take upon you\r\na middle name between that of auxiliaries and of enemies, and so become\r\njudges in this case. However, consider what these men will gain by being\r\ncalled into judgment before you, for such undeniable and such flagrant\r\ncrimes, who would not vouchsafe to hear such as had no accusations laid\r\nagainst them to speak a word for themselves. However, let them gain this\r\nadvantage by your coming. But still, if you will neither take our part\r\nin that indignation we have at these men, nor judge between us, the\r\nthird thing I have to propose is this, that you let us both alone,\r\nand neither insult upon our calamities, nor abide with these plotters\r\nagainst their metropolis; for though you should have ever so great a\r\nsuspicion that some of us have discoursed with the Romans, it is in your\r\npower to watch the passages into the city; and in case any thing that we\r\nhave been accused of is brought to light, then to come and defend your\r\nmetropolis, and to inflict punishment on those that are found guilty;\r\nfor the enemy cannot prevent you who are so near to the city. But if,\r\nafter all, none of these proposals seem acceptable and moderate, do not\r\nyou wonder that the gates are shut against you, while you bear your arms\r\nabout you.\"\r\n\r\n4. Thus spake Jesus; yet did not the multitude of the Idumeans give any\r\nattention to what he said, but were in a rage, because they did not meet\r\nwith a ready entrance into the city. The generals also had indignation\r\nat the offer of laying down their arms, and looked upon it as equal to\r\na captivity, to throw them away at any man's injunction whomsoever.\r\nBut Simon, the son of Cathlas, one of their commanders, with much ado\r\nquieted the tumult of his own men, and stood so that the high priests\r\nmight hear him, and said as follows: \"I can no longer wonder that the\r\npatrons of liberty are under custody in the temple, since there are\r\nthose that shut the gates of our common city 8 to their own nation, and\r\nat the same time are prepared to admit the Romans into it; nay, perhaps\r\nare disposed to crown the gates with garlands at their coming, while\r\nthey speak to the Idumeans from their own towers, and enjoin them to\r\nthrow down their arms which they have taken up for the preservation of\r\nits liberty. And while they will not intrust the guard of our metropolis\r\nto their kindred, profess to make them judges of the differences that\r\nare among them; nay, while they accuse some men of having slain others\r\nwithout a legal trial, they do themselves condemn a whole nation after\r\nan ignominious manner, and have now walled up that city from their\r\nown nation, which used to be open to even all foreigners that came to\r\nworship there. We have indeed come in great haste to you, and to a war\r\nagainst our own countrymen; and the reason why we have made such haste\r\nis this, that we may preserve that freedom which you are so unhappy\r\nas to betray. You have probably been guilty of the like crimes against\r\nthose whom you keep in custody, and have, I suppose, collected together\r\nthe like plausible pretenses against them also that you make use of\r\nagainst us; after which you have gotten the mastery of those within the\r\ntemple, and keep them in custody, while they are only taking care of\r\nthe public affairs. You have also shut the gates of the city in general\r\nagainst nations that are the most nearly related to you; and while you\r\ngive such injurious commands to others, you complain that you have been\r\ntyrannized over by them, and fix the name of unjust governors upon such\r\nas are tyrannized over by yourselves. Who can bear this your abuse of\r\nwords, while they have a regard to the contrariety of your actions,\r\nunless you mean this, that those Idumeans do now exclude you out of\r\nyour metropolis, whom you exclude from the sacred offices of your own\r\ncountry? One may indeed justly complain of those that are besieged in\r\nthe temple, that when they had courage enough to punish those tyrants\r\nwhom you call eminent men, and free from any accusations, because of\r\ntheir being your companions in wickedness, they did not begin with you,\r\nand thereby cut off beforehand the most dangerous parts of this treason.\r\nBut if these men have been more merciful than the public necessity\r\nrequired, we that are Idumeans will preserve this house of God, and will\r\nfight for our common country, and will oppose by war as well those that\r\nattack them from abroad, as those that betray them from within. Here\r\nwill we abide before the walls in our armor, until either the Romans\r\ngrow weary in waiting for you, or you become friends to liberty, and\r\nrepent of what you have done against it.\"\r\n\r\n5. And now did the Idumeans make an acclamation to what Simon had said;\r\nbut Jesus went away sorrowful, as seeing that the Idumeans were against\r\nall moderate counsels, and that the city was besieged on both sides. Nor\r\nindeed were the minds of the Idumeans at rest; for they were in a rage\r\nat the injury that had been offered them by their exclusion out of the\r\ncity; and when they thought the zealots had been strong, but saw nothing\r\nof theirs to support them, they were in doubt about the matter, and many\r\nof them repented that they had come thither. But the shame that would\r\nattend them in case they returned without doing any thing at all, so far\r\novercame that their repentance, that they lay all night before the wall,\r\nthough in a very bad encampment; for there broke out a prodigious storm\r\nin the night, with the utmost violence, and very strong winds, with\r\nthe largest showers of rain, with continued lightnings, terrible\r\nthunderings, and amazing concussions and bellowings of the earth, that\r\nwas in an earthquake. These things were a manifest indication that some\r\ndestruction was coming upon men, when the system of the world was\r\nput into this disorder; and any one would guess that these wonders\r\nforeshowed some grand calamities that were coming.\r\n\r\n6. Now the opinion of the Idumeans and of the citizens was one and the\r\nsame. The Idumeans thought that God was angry at their taking arms, and\r\nthat they would not escape punishment for their making war upon their\r\nmetropolis. Ananus and his party thought that they had conquered without\r\nfighting, and that God acted as a general for them; but truly they\r\nproved both ill conjectures at what was to come, and made those events\r\nto be ominous to their enemies, while they were themselves to undergo\r\nthe ill effects of them; for the Idumeans fenced one another by uniting\r\ntheir bodies into one band, and thereby kept themselves warm, and\r\nconnecting their shields over their heads, were not so much hurt by the\r\nrain. But the zealots were more deeply concerned for the danger these\r\nmen were in than they were for themselves, and got together, and looked\r\nabout them to see whether they could devise any means of assisting them.\r\nThe hotter sort of them thought it best to force their guards with their\r\narms, and after that to fall into the midst of the city, and publicly\r\nopen the gates to those that came to their assistance; as supposing the\r\nguards would be in disorder, and give way at such an unexpected attempt\r\nof theirs, especially as the greater part of them were unarmed and\r\nunskilled in the affairs of war; and that besides the multitude of the\r\ncitizens would not be easily gathered together, but confined to\r\ntheir houses by the storm: and that if there were any hazard in their\r\nundertaking, it became them to suffer any thing whatsoever themselves,\r\nrather than to overlook so great a multitude as were miserably perishing\r\non their account. But the more prudent part of them disapproved of this\r\nforcible method, because they saw not only the guards about them very\r\nnumerous, but the walls of the city itself carefully watched, by reason\r\nof the Idumeans. They also supposed that Ananus would be every where,\r\nand visit the guards every hour; which indeed was done upon other\r\nnights, but was omitted that night, not by reason of any slothfulness\r\nof Ananus, but by the overbearing appointment of fate, that so both he\r\nmight himself perish, and the multitude of the guards might perish with\r\nhim; for truly, as the night was far gone, and the storm very terrible,\r\nAnanus gave the guards in the cloisters leave to go to sleep; while it\r\ncame into the heads of the zealots to make use of the saws belonging to\r\nthe temple, and to cut the bars of the gates to pieces. The noise of the\r\nwind, and that not inferior sound of the thunder, did here also conspire\r\nwith their designs, that the noise of the saws was not heard by the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n7. So they secretly went out of the temple to the wall of the city, and\r\nmade use of their saws, and opened that gate which was over against the\r\nIdumeans. Now at first there came a fear upon the Idumeans themselves,\r\nwhich disturbed them, as imagining that Ananus and his party were coming\r\nto attack them, so that every one of them had his right hand upon his\r\nsword, in order to defend himself; but they soon came to know who they\r\nwere that came to them, and were entered the city. And had the Idumeans\r\nthen fallen upon the city, nothing could have hindered them from\r\ndestroying the people every man of them, such was the rage they were in\r\nat that time; but as they first of all made haste to get the zealots out\r\nof custody, which those that brought them in earnestly desired them to\r\ndo, and not to overlook those for whose sakes they were come, in the\r\nmidst of their distresses, nor to bring them into a still greater\r\ndanger; for that when they had once seized upon the guards, it would\r\nbe easy for them to fall upon the city; but that if the city were once\r\nalarmed, they would not then be able to overcome those guards, because\r\nas soon as they should perceive they were there, they would put\r\nthemselves in order to fight them, and would hinder their coming into\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Cruelty Of The Idumeans When They Were Gotten Into The\r\n     Temple During The Storm; And Of The Zealots. Concerning The\r\n     Slaughter Of Ananus, And Jesus, And Zacharias; And How The\r\n     Idumeans Retired Home.\r\n\r\n1. This advice pleased the Idumeans, and they ascended through the\r\ncity to the temple. The zealots were also in great expectation of\r\ntheir coming, and earnestly waited for them. When therefore these were\r\nentering, they also came boldly out of the inner temple, and mixing\r\nthemselves among the Idumeans, they attacked the guards; and some of\r\nthose that were upon the watch, but were fallen asleep, they killed as\r\nthey were asleep; but as those that were now awakened made a cry, the\r\nwhole multitude arose, and in the amazement they were in caught hold of\r\ntheir arms immediately, and betook themselves to their own defense; and\r\nso long as they thought they were only the zealots who attacked them,\r\nthey went on boldly, as hoping to overpower them by their numbers; but\r\nwhen they saw others pressing in upon them also, they perceived the\r\nIdumeans were got in; and the greatest part of them laid aside\r\ntheir arms, together with their courage, and betook themselves to\r\nlamentations. But some few of the younger sort covered themselves\r\nwith their armor, and valiantly received the Idumeans, and for a while\r\nprotected the multitude of old men. Others, indeed, gave a signal to\r\nthose that were in the city of the calamities they were in; but when\r\nthese were also made sensible that the Idumeans were come in, none of\r\nthem durst come to their assistance, only they returned the terrible\r\necho of wailing, and lamented their misfortunes. A great howling of the\r\nwomen was excited also, and every one of the guards were in danger\r\nof being killed. The zealots also joined in the shouts raised by the\r\nIdumeans; and the storm itself rendered the cry more terrible; nor did\r\nthe Idumeans spare any body; for as they are naturally a most barbarous\r\nand bloody nation, and had been distressed by the tempest, they made use\r\nof their weapons against those that had shut the gates against them, and\r\nacted in the same manner as to those that supplicated for their lives,\r\nand to those that fought them, insomuch that they ran through those with\r\ntheir swords who desired them to remember the relation there was between\r\nthem, and begged of them to have regard to their common temple. Now\r\nthere was at present neither any place for flight, nor any hope of\r\npreservation; but as they were driven one upon another in heaps, so\r\nwere they slain. Thus the greater part were driven together by force, as\r\nthere was now no place of retirement, and the murderers were upon them;\r\nand, having no other way, threw themselves down headlong into the city;\r\nwhereby, in my opinion, they underwent a more miserable destruction than\r\nthat which they avoided, because that was a voluntary one. And now the\r\nouter temple was all of it overflowed with blood; and that day, as it\r\ncame on, they saw eight thousand five hundred dead bodies there.\r\n\r\n2. But the rage of the Idumeans was not satiated by these slaughters;\r\nbut they now betook themselves to the city, and plundered every house,\r\nand slew every one they met; and for the other multitude, they esteemed\r\nit needless to go on with killing them, but they sought for the high\r\npriests, and the generality went with the greatest zeal against them;\r\nand as soon as they caught them they slew them, and then standing upon\r\ntheir dead bodies, in way of jest, upbraided Ananus with his kindness to\r\nthe people, and Jesus with his speech made to them from the wall. Nay,\r\nthey proceeded to that degree of impiety, as to cast away their dead\r\nbodies without burial, although the Jews used to take so much care of\r\nthe burial of men, that they took down those that were condemned and\r\ncrucified, and buried them before the going down of the sun. I should\r\nnot mistake if I said that the death of Ananus was the beginning of the\r\ndestruction of the city, and that from this very day may be dated the\r\noverthrow of her wall, and the ruin of her affairs, whereon they saw\r\ntheir high priest, and the procurer of their preservation, slain in the\r\nmidst of their city. He was on other accounts also a venerable, and a\r\nvery just man; and besides the grandeur of that nobility, and dignity,\r\nand honor of which he was possessed, he had been a lover of a kind\r\nof parity, even with regard to the meanest of the people; he was\r\na prodigious lover of liberty, and an admirer of a democracy in\r\ngovernment; and did ever prefer the public welfare before his own\r\nadvantage, and preferred peace above all things; for he was thoroughly\r\nsensible that the Romans were not to be conquered. He also foresaw\r\nthat of necessity a war would follow, and that unless the Jews made up\r\nmatters with them very dexterously, they would be destroyed; to say\r\nall in a word, if Ananus had survived, they had certainly compounded\r\nmatters; for he was a shrewd man in speaking and persuading the people,\r\nand had already gotten the mastery of those that opposed his designs, or\r\nwere for the war. And the Jews had then put abundance of delays in the\r\nway of the Romans, if they had had such a general as he was. Jesus\r\nwas also joined with him; and although he was inferior to him upon the\r\ncomparison, he was superior to the rest; and I cannot but think that it\r\nwas because God had doomed this city to destruction, as a polluted city,\r\nand was resolved to purge his sanctuary by fire, that he cut off these\r\ntheir great defenders and well-wishers, while those that a little before\r\nhad worn the sacred garments, and had presided over the public worship;\r\nand had been esteemed venerable by those that dwelt on the whole\r\nhabitable earth when they came into our city, were cast out naked, and\r\nseen to be the food of dogs and wild beasts. And I cannot but imagine\r\nthat virtue itself groaned at these men's case, and lamented that she\r\nwas here so terribly conquered by wickedness. And this at last was the\r\nend of Ananus and Jesus.\r\n\r\n3. Now after these were slain, the zealots and the multitude of the\r\nIdumeans fell upon the people as upon a flock of profane animals, and\r\ncut their throats; and for the ordinary sort, they were destroyed in\r\nwhat place soever they caught them. But for the noblemen and the youth,\r\nthey first caught them and bound them, and shut them up in prison, and\r\nput off their slaughter, in hopes that some of them would turn over to\r\ntheir party; but not one of them would comply with their desires, but\r\nall of them preferred death before being enrolled among such wicked\r\nwretches as acted against their own country. But this refusal of theirs\r\nbrought upon them terrible torments; for they were so scourged and\r\ntortured, that their bodies were not able to sustain their torments,\r\ntill at length, and with difficulty, they had the favor to be slain.\r\nThose whom they caught in the day time were slain in the night, and then\r\ntheir bodies were carried out and thrown away, that there might be room\r\nfor other prisoners; and the terror that was upon the people was so\r\ngreat, that no one had courage enough either to weep openly for the dead\r\nman that was related to him, or to bury him; but those that were shut up\r\nin their own houses could only shed tears in secret, and durst not even\r\ngroan without great caution, lest any of their enemies should hear them;\r\nfor if they did, those that mourned for others soon underwent the same\r\ndeath with those whom they mourned for. Only in the night time they\r\nwould take up a little dust, and throw it upon their bodies; and even\r\nsome that were the most ready to expose themselves to danger would do it\r\nin the day time: and there were twelve thousand of the better sort who\r\nperished in this manner.\r\n\r\n4. And now these zealots and Idumeans were quite weary of barely killing\r\nmen, so they had the impudence of setting up fictitious tribunals and\r\njudicatures for that purpose; and as they intended to have Zacharias 9\r\nthe son of Baruch, one of the most eminent of the citizens, slain, so\r\nwhat provoked them against him was, that hatred of wickedness and love\r\nof liberty which were so eminent in him: he was also a rich man, so that\r\nby taking him off, they did not only hope to seize his effects, but\r\nalso to get rid of a mall that had great power to destroy them. So they\r\ncalled together, by a public proclamation, seventy of the principal men\r\nof the populace, for a show, as if they were real judges, while they had\r\nno proper authority. Before these was Zacharias accused of a design\r\nto betray their polity to the Romans, and having traitorously sent to\r\nVespasian for that purpose. Now there appeared no proof or sign of\r\nwhat he was accused; but they affirmed themselves that they were well\r\npersuaded that so it was, and desired that such their affirmation might\r\nbe taken for sufficient evidence. Now when Zacharias clearly saw that\r\nthere was no way remaining for his escape from them, as having been\r\ntreacherously called before them, and then put in prison, but not with\r\nany intention of a legal trial, he took great liberty of speech in that\r\ndespair of his life he was under. Accordingly he stood up, and laughed\r\nat their pretended accusation, and in a few words confuted the crimes\r\nlaid to his charge; after which he turned his speech to his accusers,\r\nand went over distinctly all their transgressions of the law, and made\r\nheavy lamentation upon the confusion they had brought public affairs\r\nto: in the mean time, the zealots grew tumultuous, and had much ado to\r\nabstain from drawing their swords, although they designed to preserve\r\nthe appearance and show of judicature to the end. They were also\r\ndesirous, on other accounts, to try the judges, whether they would be\r\nmindful of what was just at their own peril. Now the seventy judges\r\nbrought in their verdict that the person accused was not guilty, as\r\nchoosing rather to die themselves with him, than to have his death laid\r\nat their doors; hereupon there arose a great clamor of the zealots\r\nupon his acquittal, and they all had indignation at the judges for not\r\nunderstanding that the authority that was given them was but in jest.\r\nSo two of the boldest of them fell upon Zacharias in the middle of the\r\ntemple, and slew him; and as he fell down dead, they bantered him,\r\nand said, \"Thou hast also our verdict, and this will prove a more sure\r\nacquittal to thee than the other.\" They also threw him down from the\r\ntemple immediately into the valley beneath it. Moreover, they struck the\r\njudges with the backs of their swords, by way of abuse, and thrust them\r\nout of the court of the temple, and spared their lives with no other\r\ndesign than that, when they were dispersed among the people in the city,\r\nthey might become their messengers, to let them know they were no better\r\nthan slaves.\r\n\r\n5. But by this time the Idumeans repented of their coming, and were\r\ndispleased at what had been done; and when they were assembled together\r\nby one of the zealots, who had come privately to them, he declared\r\nto them what a number of wicked pranks they had themselves done in\r\nconjunction with those that invited them, and gave a particular account\r\nof what mischiefs had been done against their metropolis. He said that\r\nthey had taken arms, as though the high priests were betraying their\r\nmetropolis to the Romans, but had found no indication of any such\r\ntreachery; but that they had succored those that had pretended to\r\nbelieve such a thing, while they did themselves the works of war and\r\ntyranny, after an insolent manner. It had been indeed their business to\r\nhave hindered them from such their proceedings at the first, but seeing\r\nthey had once been partners with them in shedding the blood of their\r\nown countrymen, it was high time to put a stop to such crimes, and not\r\ncontinue to afford any more assistance to such as are subverting the\r\nlaws of their forefathers; for that if any had taken it ill that the\r\ngates had been shut against them, and they had not been permitted to\r\ncome into the city, yet that those who had excluded them have been\r\npunished, and Ananus is dead, and that almost all those people had been\r\ndestroyed in one night's time. That one may perceive many of themselves\r\nnow repenting for what they had done, and might see the horrid barbarity\r\nof those that had invited them, and that they had no regard to such as\r\nhad saved them; that they were so impudent as to perpetrate the vilest\r\nthings, under the eyes of those that had supported them, and that their\r\nwicked actions would be laid to the charge of the Idumeans, and would\r\nbe so laid to their charge till somebody obstructs their proceedings, or\r\nseparates himself from the same wicked action; that they therefore ought\r\nto retire home, since the imputation of treason appears to be a Calumny,\r\nand that there was no expectation of the coming of the Romans at this\r\ntime, and that the government of the city was secured by such walls as\r\ncannot easily be thrown down; and, by avoiding any further fellowship\r\nwith these bad men, to make some excuse for themselves, as to what they\r\nhad been so far deluded, as to have been partners with them hitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The Zealots When They Were Freed From The Idumeans, Slew\r\n     A Great Many More Of The Citizens; And How Vespasian\r\n     Dissuaded The Romans When They Were Very Earnest To March\r\n     Against The Jews From Proceeding In The War At That Time.\r\n\r\n1. The Idumeans complied with these persuasions; and, in the first\r\nplace, they set those that were in the prisons at liberty, being about\r\ntwo thousand of the populace, who thereupon fled away immediately to\r\nSimon, one whom we shall speak of presently. After which these Idumeans\r\nretired from Jerusalem, and went home; which departure of theirs was\r\na great surprise to both parties; for the people, not knowing of their\r\nrepentance, pulled up their courage for a while, as eased of so many of\r\ntheir enemies, while the zealots grew more insolent not as deserted by\r\ntheir confederates, but as freed from such men as might hinder their\r\ndesigns, and plot some stop to their wickedness. Accordingly, they\r\nmade no longer any delay, nor took any deliberation in their enormous\r\npractices, but made use of the shortest methods for all their executions\r\nand what they had once resolved upon, they put in practice sooner than\r\nany one could imagine. But their thirst was chiefly after the blood\r\nof valiant men, and men of good families; the one sort of which they\r\ndestroyed out of envy, the other out of fear; for they thought their\r\nwhole security lay in leaving no potent men alive; on which account they\r\nslew Gorion, a person eminent in dignity, and on account of his family\r\nalso; he was also for democracy, and of as great boldness and freedom\r\nof spirit as were any of the Jews whosoever; the principal thing that\r\nruined him, added to his other advantages, was his free speaking. Nor\r\ndid Niger of Peres escape their hands; he had been a man of great valor\r\nin their war with the Romans, but was now drawn through the middle of\r\nthe city, and, as he went, he frequently cried out, and showed the scars\r\nof his wounds; and when he was drawn out of the gates, and despaired of\r\nhis preservation, he besought them to grant him a burial; but as they\r\nhad threatened him beforehand not to grant him any spot of earth for a\r\ngrave, which he chiefly desired of them, so did they slay him [without\r\npermitting him to be buried]. Now when they were slaying him, he made\r\nthis imprecation upon them, that they might undergo both famine and\r\npestilence in this war, and besides all that, they might come to the\r\nmutual slaughter of one another; all which imprecations God confirmed\r\nagainst these impious men, and was what came most justly upon them,\r\nwhen not long afterward they tasted of their own madness in their mutual\r\nseditions one against another. So when this Niger was killed, their\r\nfears of being overturned were diminished; and indeed there was no part\r\nof the people but they found out some pretense to destroy them; for\r\nsome were therefore slain, because they had had differences with some of\r\nthem; and as to those that had not opposed them in times of peace, they\r\nwatched seasonable opportunities to gain some accusation against\r\nthem; and if any one did not come near them at all, he was under their\r\nsuspicion as a proud man; if any one came with boldness, he was esteemed\r\na contemner of them; and if any one came as aiming to oblige them, he\r\nwas supposed to have some treacherous plot against them; while the only\r\npunishment of crimes, whether they were of the greatest or smallest\r\nsort, was death. Nor could any one escape, unless he were very\r\ninconsiderable, either on account of the meanness of his birth, or on\r\naccount of his fortune.\r\n\r\n2. And now all the rest of the commanders of the Romans deemed this\r\nsedition among their enemies to be of great advantage to them, and were\r\nvery earnest to march to the city, and they urged Vespasian, as their\r\nlord and general in all cases, to make haste, and said to him, that \"the\r\nprovidence of God is on our side, by setting our enemies at variance\r\nagainst one another; that still the change in such cases may be sudden,\r\nand the Jews may quickly be at one again, either because they may be\r\ntired out with their civil miseries, or repent them of such doings.\" But\r\nVespasian replied, that they were greatly mistaken in what they thought\r\nfit to be done, as those that, upon the theater, love to make a show\r\nof their hands, and of their weapons, but do it at their own hazard,\r\nwithout considering, what was for their advantage, and for their\r\nsecurity; for that if they now go and attack the city immediately, \"they\r\nshall but occasion their enemies to unite together, and shall convert\r\ntheir force, now it is in its height, against themselves. But if they\r\nstay a while, they shall have fewer enemies, because they will be\r\nconsumed in this sedition: that God acts as a general of the Romans\r\nbetter than he can do, and is giving the Jews up to them without any\r\npains of their own, and granting their army a victory without any\r\ndanger; that therefore it is their best way, while their enemies\r\nare destroying each other with their own hands, and falling into the\r\ngreatest of misfortunes, which is that of sedition, to sit still as\r\nspectators of the dangers they run into, rather than to fight hand to\r\nhand with men that love murdering, and are mad one against another. But\r\nif any one imagines that the glory of victory, when it is gotten without\r\nfighting, will be more insipid, let him know this much, that a glorious\r\nsuccess, quietly obtained, is more profitable than the dangers of\r\na battle; for we ought to esteem these that do what is agreeable to\r\ntemperance and prudence no less glorious than those that have gained\r\ngreat reputation by their actions in war: that he shall lead on his army\r\nwith greater force when their enemies are diminished, and his own army\r\nrefreshed after the continual labors they had undergone. However, that\r\nthis is not a proper time to propose to ourselves the glory of victory;\r\nfor that the Jews are not now employed in making of armor or building of\r\nwalls, nor indeed in getting together auxiliaries, while the advantage\r\nwill be on their side who give them such opportunity of delay; but\r\nthat the Jews are vexed to pieces every day by their civil wars and\r\ndissensions, and are under greater miseries than, if they were once\r\ntaken, could be inflicted on them by us. Whether therefore any one\r\nhath regard to what is for our safety, he ought to suffer these Jews to\r\ndestroy one another; or whether he hath regard to the greater glory of\r\nthe action, we ought by no means to meddle with those men, now they are\r\nafflicted with a distemper at home; for should we now conquer them, it\r\nwould be said the conquest was not owing to our bravery, but to their\r\nsedition.\" 10\r\n\r\n3. And now the commanders joined in their approbation of what Vespasian\r\nhad said, and it was soon discovered how wise an opinion he had given.\r\nAnd indeed many there were of the Jews that deserted every day, and fled\r\naway from the zealots, although their flight was very difficult, since\r\nthey had guarded every passage out of the city, and slew every one that\r\nwas caught at them, as taking it for granted they were going over to the\r\nRomans; yet did he who gave them money get clear off, while he only that\r\ngave them none was voted a traitor. So the upshot was this, that the\r\nrich purchased their flight by money, while none but the poor were\r\nslain. Along all the roads also vast numbers of dead bodies lay in\r\nheaps, and even many of those that were so zealous in deserting at\r\nlength chose rather to perish within the city; for the hopes of burial\r\nmade death in their own city appear of the two less terrible to them.\r\nBut these zealots came at last to that degree of barbarity, as not to\r\nbestow a burial either on those slain in the city, or on those that lay\r\nalong the roads; but as if they had made an agreement to cancel both the\r\nlaws of their country and the laws of nature, and, at the same time\r\nthat they defiled men with their wicked actions, they would pollute the\r\nDivinity itself also, they left the dead bodies to putrefy under the\r\nsun; and the same punishment was allotted to such as buried any as\r\nto those that deserted, which was no other than death; while he that\r\ngranted the favor of a grave to another would presently stand in need\r\nof a grave himself. To say all in a word, no other gentle passion was so\r\nentirely lost among them as mercy; for what were the greatest objects of\r\npity did most of all irritate these wretches, and they transferred their\r\nrage from the living to those that had been slain, and from the dead\r\nto the living. Nay, the terror was so very great, that he who survived\r\ncalled them that were first dead happy, as being at rest already; as did\r\nthose that were under torture in the prisons, declare, that, upon\r\nthis comparison, those that lay unburied were the happiest. These men,\r\ntherefore, trampled upon all the laws of men, and laughed at the laws\r\nof God; and for the oracles of the prophets, they ridiculed them as\r\nthe tricks of jugglers; yet did these prophets foretell many things\r\nconcerning [the rewards of] virtue, and [punishments of] vice, which\r\nwhen these zealots violated, they occasioned the fulfilling of those\r\nvery prophecies belonging to their own country; for there was a certain\r\nancient oracle of those men, that the city should then be taken and\r\nthe sanctuary burnt, by right of war, when a sedition should invade the\r\nJews, and their own hand should pollute the temple of God. Now while\r\nthese zealots did not [quite] disbelieve these predictions, they made\r\nthemselves the instruments of their accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How John Tyrannized Over The Rest; And What Mischiefs The\r\n     Zealots Did At Masada. How Also Vespasian Took Gadara; And\r\n     What Actions Were Performed By Placidus.\r\n\r\n1. By this time John was beginning to tyrannize, and thought it beneath\r\nhim to accept of barely the same honors that others had; and joining to\r\nhimself by degrees a party of the wickedest of them all, he broke\r\noff from the rest of the faction. This was brought about by his still\r\ndisagreeing with the opinions of others, and giving out injunctions\r\nof his own, in a very imperious manner; so that it was evident he was\r\nsetting up a monarchical power. Now some submitted to him out of their\r\nfear of him, and others out of their good-will to him; for he was a\r\nshrewd man to entice men to him, both by deluding them and putting\r\ncheats upon them. Nay, many there were that thought they should be safer\r\nthemselves, if the causes of their past insolent actions should now be\r\nreduced to one head, and not to a great many. His activity was so great,\r\nand that both in action and in counsel, that he had not a few guards\r\nabout him; yet was there a great party of his antagonists that left him;\r\namong whom envy at him weighed a great deal, while they thought it a\r\nvery heavy thing to be in subjection to one that was formerly their\r\nequal. But the main reason that moved men against him was the dread of\r\nmonarchy, for they could not hope easily to put an end to his power,\r\nif he had once obtained it; and yet they knew that he would have this\r\npretense always against them, that they had opposed him when he was\r\nfirst advanced; while every one chose rather to suffer any thing\r\nwhatsoever in war, than that, when they had been in a voluntary slavery\r\nfor some time, they should afterward perish. So the sedition was divided\r\ninto two parts, and John reigned in opposition to his adversaries over\r\none of them: but for their leaders, they watched one another, nor\r\ndid they at all, or at least very little, meddle with arms in their\r\nquarrels; but they fought earnestly against the people, and contended\r\none with another which of them should bring home the greatest prey. But\r\nbecause the city had to struggle with three of the greatest misfortunes,\r\nwar, and tyranny, and sedition, it appeared, upon the comparison,\r\nthat the war was the least troublesome to the populace of them all.\r\nAccordingly, they ran away from their own houses to foreigners, and\r\nobtained that preservation from the Romans which they despaired to\r\nobtain among their own people.\r\n\r\n2. And now a fourth misfortune arose, in order to bring our nation to\r\ndestruction. There was a fortress of very great strength not far\r\nfrom Jerusalem, which had been built by our ancient kings, both as\r\na repository for their effects in the hazards of war, and for the\r\npreservation of their bodies at the same time. It was called Masada.\r\nThose that were called Sicarii had taken possession of it formerly,\r\nbut at this time they overran the neighboring countries, aiming only\r\nto procure to themselves necessaries; for the fear they were then in\r\nprevented their further ravages. But when once they were informed\r\nthat the Roman army lay still, and that the Jews were divided between\r\nsedition and tyranny, they boldly undertook greater matters; and at the\r\nfeast of unleavened bread, which the Jews celebrate in memory of their\r\ndeliverance from the Egyptian bondage, when they were sent back into\r\nthe country of their forefathers, they came down by night, without\r\nbeing discovered by those that could have prevented them, and overran a\r\ncertain small city called Engaddi:--in which expedition they prevented\r\nthose citizens that could have stopped them, before they could arm\r\nthemselves, and fight them. They also dispersed them, and cast them\r\nout of the city. As for such as could not run away, being women and\r\nchildren, they slew of them above seven hundred. Afterward, when they\r\nhad carried every thing out of their houses, and had seized upon all\r\nthe fruits that were in a flourishing condition, they brought them into\r\nMasada. And indeed these men laid all the villages that were about the\r\nfortress waste, and made the whole country desolate; while there came to\r\nthem every day, from all parts, not a few men as corrupt as themselves.\r\nAt that time all the other regions of Judea that had hitherto been at\r\nrest were in motion, by means of the robbers. Now as it is in a human\r\nbody, if the principal part be inflamed, all the members are subject to\r\nthe same distemper; so, by means of the sedition and disorder that\r\nwas in the metropolis,. had the wicked men that were in the country\r\nopportunity to ravage the same. Accordingly, when every one of them had\r\nplundered their own villages, they then retired into the desert; yet\r\nwere these men that now got together, and joined in the conspiracy by\r\nparties, too small for an army, and too many for a gang of thieves: and\r\nthus did they fall upon the holy places 11 and the cities; yet did it\r\nnow so happen that they were sometimes very ill treated by those upon\r\nwhom they fell with such violence, and were taken by them as men are\r\ntaken in war: but still they prevented any further punishment as do\r\nrobbers, who, as soon as their ravages [are discovered], run their\r\nway. Nor was there now any part of Judea that was not in a miserable\r\ncondition, as well as its most eminent city also.\r\n\r\n3. These things were told Vespasian by deserters; for although the\r\nseditious watched all the passages out of the city, and destroyed all,\r\nwhosoever they were, that came thither, yet were there some that had\r\nconcealed themselves, and when they had fled to the Romans, persuaded\r\ntheir general to come to their city's assistance, and save the remainder\r\nof the people; informing him withal, that it was upon account of the\r\npeople's good-will to the Romans that many of them were already slain,\r\nand the survivors in danger of the same treatment. Vespasian did indeed\r\nalready pity the calamities these men were in, and arose, in appearance,\r\nas though he was going to besiege Jerusalem, but in reality to deliver\r\nthem from a [worse] siege they were already under. However, he was\r\nobliged first to overthrow what remained elsewhere, and to leave nothing\r\nout of Jerusalem behind him that might interrupt him in that siege.\r\nAccordingly, he marched against Gadara, the metropolis of Perea, which\r\nwas a place of strength, and entered that city on the fourth day of the\r\nmonth Dystrus [Adar]; for the men of power had sent an embassage to\r\nhim, without the knowledge of the seditious, to treat about a surrender;\r\nwhich they did out of the desire they had of peace, and for saving their\r\neffects, because many of the citizens of Gadara were rich men. This\r\nembassy the opposite party knew nothing of, but discovered it as\r\nVespasian was approaching near the city. However, they despaired of\r\nkeeping possession of the city, as being inferior in number to their\r\nenemies who were within the city, and seeing the Romans very near to\r\nthe city; so they resolved to fly, but thought it dishonorable to do it\r\nwithout shedding some blood, and revenging themselves on the authors\r\nof this surrender; so they seized upon Dolesus, [a person not only the\r\nfirst in rank and family in that city, but one that seemed the occasion\r\nof sending such an embassy,] and slew him, and treated his dead body\r\nafter a barbarous manner, so very violent was their anger at him, and\r\nthen ran out of the city. And as now the Roman army was just upon them,\r\nthe people of Gadara admitted Vespasian with joyful acclamations, and\r\nreceived from him the security of his right hand, as also a garrison\r\nof horsemen and footmen, to guard them against the excursions of the\r\nrunagates; for as to their wall, they had pulled it down before\r\nthe Romans desired them so to do, that they might thereby give them\r\nassurance that they were lovers of peace, and that, if they had a mind,\r\nthey could not now make war against them.\r\n\r\n4. And now Vespasian sent Placidus against those that had fled from\r\nGadara, with five hundred horsemen, and three thousand footmen, while he\r\nreturned himself to Cesarea, with the rest of the army. But as soon\r\nas these fugitives saw the horsemen that pursued them just upon their\r\nbacks, and before they came to a close fight, they ran together to a\r\ncertain village, which was called Bethennabris, where finding a great\r\nmultitude of young men, and arming them, partly by their own consent,\r\npartly by force, they rashly and suddenly assaulted Placidus and the\r\ntroops that were with him. These horsemen at the first onset gave way a\r\nlittle, as contriving to entice them further off the wall; and when they\r\nhad drawn them into a place fit for their purpose, they made their horse\r\nencompass them round, and threw their darts at them. So the horsemen cut\r\noff the flight of the fugitives, while the foot terribly destroyed those\r\nthat fought against them; for those Jews did no more than show their\r\ncourage, and then were destroyed; for as they fell upon the Romans when\r\nthey were joined close together, and, as it were, walled about with\r\ntheir entire armor, they were not able to find any place where the darts\r\ncould enter, nor were they any way able to break their ranks, while they\r\nwere themselves run through by the Roman darts, and, like the wildest\r\nof wild beasts, rushed upon the point of others' swords; so some of them\r\nwere destroyed, as cut with their enemies' swords upon their faces, and\r\nothers were dispersed by the horsemen.\r\n\r\n5. Now Placidus's concern was to exclude them in their flight from\r\ngetting into the village; and causing his horse to march continually on\r\nthat side of them, he then turned short upon them, and at the same time\r\nhis men made use of their darts, and easily took their aim at those that\r\nwere the nearest to them, as they made those that were further off turn\r\nback by the terror they were in, till at last the most courageous of\r\nthem brake through those horsemen and fled to the wall of the village.\r\nAnd now those that guarded the wall were in great doubt what to do;\r\nfor they could not bear the thoughts of excluding those that came from\r\nGadara, because of their own people that were among them; and yet, if\r\nthey should admit them, they expected to perish with them, which came\r\nto pass accordingly; for as they were crowding together at the wall, the\r\nRoman horsemen were just ready to fall in with them. However, the guards\r\nprevented them, and shut the gates, when Placidus made an assault upon\r\nthem, and fighting courageously till it was dark, he got possession\r\nof the wall, and of the people that were in the city, when the useless\r\nmultitude were destroyed; but those that were more potent ran away, and\r\nthe soldiers plundered the houses, and set the village on fire. As for\r\nthose that ran out of the village, they stirred up such as were in the\r\ncountry, and exaggerating their own calamities, and telling them that\r\nthe whole army of the Romans were upon them, they put them into great\r\nfear on every side; so they got in great numbers together, and fled to\r\nJericho, for they knew no other place that could afford them any hope of\r\nescaping, it being a city that had a strong wall, and a great multitude\r\nof inhabitants. But Placidus, relying much upon his horsemen, and his\r\nformer good success, followed them, and slew all that he overtook,\r\nas far as Jordan; and when he had driven the whole multitude to the\r\nriver-side, where they were stopped by the current, [for it had been\r\naugmented lately by rains, and was not fordable,] he put his soldiers\r\nin array over against them; so the necessity the others were in provoked\r\nthem to hazard a battle, because there was no place whither they could\r\nflee. They then extended themselves a very great way along the banks of\r\nthe river, and sustained the darts that were thrown at them, as well as\r\nthe attacks of the horsemen, who beat many of them, and pushed them into\r\nthe current. At which fight, hand to hand, fifteen thousand of them were\r\nslain, while the number of those that were unwillingly forced to leap\r\ninto Jordan was prodigious. There were besides two thousand and two\r\nhundred taken prisoners. A mighty prey was taken also, consisting of\r\nasses, and sheep, and camels, and oxen.\r\n\r\n6. Now this destruction that fell upon the Jews, as it was not inferior\r\nto any of the rest in itself, so did it still appear greater than it\r\nreally was; and this, because not only the whole country through which\r\nthey fled was filled with slaughter, and Jordan could not be passed\r\nover, by reason of the dead bodies that were in it, but because the lake\r\nAsphaltites was also full of dead bodies, that were carried down into\r\nit by the river. And now Placidus, after this good success that he had,\r\nfell violently upon the neighboring smaller cities and villages; when he\r\ntook Abila, and Julias, and Bezemoth, and all those that lay as far as\r\nthe lake Asphaltites, and put such of the deserters into each of them as\r\nhe thought proper. He then put his soldiers on board the ships, and\r\nslew such as had fled to the lake, insomuch that all Perea had\r\neither surrendered themselves, or were taken by the Romans, as far as\r\nMachaerus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Vespasian Upon Hearing Of Some Commotions In Gall, <a\r\n      href=\"#link4note-12\" name=\"link4noteref-12\" id=\"link4noteref-12\">12</a>\r\n     Made Haste To Finish The Jewish War. A Description Of\r\n     Jericho, And Of The Great Plain; With An Account Besides Of\r\n     The Lake Asphaltites.\r\n\r\n1. In the mean time, an account came that there were commotions in Gall,\r\nand that Vindex, together with the men of power in that country, had\r\nrevolted from Nero; which affair is more accurately described elsewhere.\r\nThis report, thus related to Vespasian, excited him to go on briskly\r\nwith the war; for he foresaw already the civil wars which were coming\r\nupon them, nay, that the very government was in danger; and he thought,\r\nif he could first reduce the eastern parts of the empire to peace, he\r\nshould make the fears for Italy the lighter; while therefore the winter\r\nwas his hinderance [from going into the field], he put garrisons into\r\nthe villages and smaller cities for their security; he put decurions\r\nalso into the villages, and centurions into the cities: he besides\r\nthis rebuilt many of the cities that had been laid waste; but at the\r\nbeginning of the spring he took the greatest part of his army, and led\r\nit from Cesarea to Antipatris, where he spent two days in settling the\r\naffairs of that city, and then, on the third day, he marched on, laying\r\nwaste and burning all the neighboring villages. And when he had laid\r\nwaste all the places about the toparchy of Thamnas, he passed on to\r\nLydda and Jamnia; and when both these cities had come over to him,\r\nhe placed a great many of those that had come over to him [from other\r\nplaces] as inhabitants therein, and then came to Emmaus, where he seized\r\nupon the passage which led thence to their metropolis, and fortified his\r\ncamp, and leaving the fifth legion therein, he came to the toparchy of\r\nBethletephon. He then destroyed that place, and the neighboring places,\r\nby fire, and fortified, at proper places, the strong holds all about\r\nIdumea; and when he had seized upon two villages, which were in the very\r\nmidst of Idumea, Betaris and Caphartobas, he slew above ten thousand of\r\nthe people, and carried into captivity above a thousand, and drove away\r\nthe rest of the multitude, and placed no small part of his own forces\r\nin them, who overran and laid waste the whole mountainous country; while\r\nhe, with the rest of his forces, returned to Emmaus, whence he came down\r\nthrough the country of Samaria, and hard by the city, by others called\r\nNeapolis, [or Sichem,] but by the people of that country Mabortha, to\r\nCorea, where he pitched his camp, on the second day of the month Desius\r\n[Sivan]; and on the day following he came to Jericho; on which day\r\nTrajan, one of his commanders, joined him with the forces he brought out\r\nof Perea, all the places beyond Jordan being subdued already.\r\n\r\n2. Hereupon a great multitude prevented their approach, and came out\r\nof Jericho, and fled to those mountainous parts that lay over against\r\nJerusalem, while that part which was left behind was in a great measure\r\ndestroyed; they also found the city desolate. It is situated in a plain;\r\nbut a naked and barren mountain, of a very great length, hangs over it,\r\nwhich extends itself to the land about Scythopolis northward, but as far\r\nas the country of Sodom, and the utmost limits of the lake Asphaltites,\r\nsouthward. This mountain is all of it very uneven and uninhabited, by\r\nreason of its barrenness: there is an opposite mountain that is situated\r\nover against it, on the other side of Jordan; this last begins at\r\nJulias, and the northern quarters, and extends itself southward as far\r\nas Somorrhon, 13 which is the bounds of Petra, in Arabia. In this ridge\r\nof mountains there is one called the Iron Mountain, that runs in length\r\nas far as Moab. Now the region that lies in the middle between these\r\nridges of mountains is called the Great Plain; it reaches from the\r\nvillage Ginnabris, as far as the lake Asphaltites; its length is two\r\nhundred and thirty furlongs, and its breadth a hundred and twenty, and\r\nit is divided in the midst by Jordan. It hath two lakes in it, that of\r\nAsphaltites, and that of Tiberias, whose natures are opposite to each\r\nother; for the former is salt and unfruitful, but that of Tiberias is\r\nsweet and fruitful. This plain is much burnt up in summer time, and, by\r\nreason of the extraordinary heat, contains a very unwholesome air; it is\r\nall destitute of water excepting the river Jordan, which water of Jordan\r\nis the occasion why those plantations of palm trees that are near its\r\nbanks are more flourishing, and much more fruitful, as are those that\r\nare remote from it not so flourishing, or fruitful.\r\n\r\n3. Notwithstanding which, there is a fountain by Jericho, that runs\r\nplentifully, and is very fit for watering the ground; it arises near\r\nthe old city, which Joshua, the son of Naue, the general of the Hebrews,\r\ntook the first of all the cities of the land of Canaan, by right of war.\r\nThe report is, that this fountain, at the beginning, caused not only the\r\nblasting of the earth and the trees, but of the children born of women,\r\nand that it was entirely of a sickly and corruptive nature to all\r\nthings whatsoever; but that it was made gentle, and very wholesome and\r\nfruitful, by the prophet Elisha. This prophet was familiar with Elijah,\r\nand was his successor, who, when he once was the guest of the people at\r\nJericho, and the men of the place had treated him very kindly, he both\r\nmade them amends as well as the country, by a lasting favor; for he went\r\nout of the city to this fountain, and threw into the current an earthen\r\nvessel full of salt; after which he stretched out his righteous hand\r\nunto heaven, and, pouring out a mild drink-offering, he made this\r\nsupplication, That the current might be mollified, and that the veins of\r\nfresh water might be opened; that God also would bring into the place\r\na more temperate and fertile air for the current, and would bestow upon\r\nthe people of that country plenty of the fruits of the earth, and a\r\nsuccession of children; and that this prolific water might never fail\r\nthem, while they continued to be righteous. To these prayers Elisha\r\n14 joined proper operations of his hands, after a skillful manner, and\r\nchanged the fountain; and that water, which had been the occasion of\r\nbarrenness and famine before, from that time did supply a numerous\r\nposterity, and afforded great abundance to the country. Accordingly, the\r\npower of it is so great in watering the ground, that if it do but once\r\ntouch a country, it affords a sweeter nourishment than other waters do,\r\nwhen they lie so long upon them, till they are satiated with them. For\r\nwhich reason, the advantage gained from other waters, when they flow in\r\ngreat plenty, is but small, while that of this water is great when it\r\nflows even in little quantities. Accordingly, it waters a larger space\r\nof ground than any other waters do, and passes along a plain of seventy\r\nfurlongs long, and twenty broad; wherein it affords nourishment to those\r\nmost excellent gardens that are thick set with trees. There are in it\r\nmany sorts of palm trees that are watered by it, different from each\r\nother in taste and name; the better sort of them, when they are pressed,\r\nyield an excellent kind of honey, not much inferior in sweetness to\r\nother honey. This country withal produces honey from bees; it also bears\r\nthat balsam which is the most precious of all the fruits in that place,\r\ncypress trees also, and those that bear myrobalanum; so that he who\r\nshould pronounce this place to be divine would not be mistaken, wherein\r\nis such plenty of trees produced as are very rare, and of the must\r\nexcellent sort. And indeed, if we speak of those other fruits, it will\r\nnot be easy to light on any climate in the habitable earth that can\r\nwell be compared to it, what is here sown comes up in such clusters;\r\nthe cause of which seems to me to be the warmth of the air, and the\r\nfertility of the waters; the warmth calling forth the sprouts, and\r\nmaking them spread, and the moisture making every one of them take root\r\nfirmly, and supplying that virtue which it stands in need of in summer\r\ntime. Now this country is then so sadly burnt up, that nobody cares to\r\ncome at it; and if the water be drawn up before sun-rising, and after\r\nthat exposed to the air, it becomes exceeding cold, and becomes of a\r\nnature quite contrary to the ambient air; as in winter again it becomes\r\nwarm; and if you go into it, it appears very gentle. The ambient air is\r\nhere also of so good a temperature, that the people of the country are\r\nclothed in linen-only, even when snow covers the rest of Judea. This\r\nplace is one hundred and fifty furlongs from Jerusalem, and sixty from\r\nJordan. The country, as far as Jerusalem, is desert and stony; but that\r\nas far as Jordan and the lake Asphaltites lies lower indeed, though it\r\nbe equally desert and barren. But so much shall suffice to have said\r\nabout Jericho, and of the great happiness of its situation.\r\n\r\n4. The nature of the lake Asphaltites is also worth describing. It is,\r\nas I have said already, bitter and unfruitful. It is so light [or thick]\r\nthat it bears up the heaviest things that are thrown into it; nor is it\r\neasy for any one to make things sink therein to the bottom, if he had a\r\nmind so to do. Accordingly, when Vespasian went to see it, he commanded\r\nthat some who could not swim should have their hands tied behind them,\r\nand be thrown into the deep, when it so happened that they all swam as\r\nif a wind had forced them upwards. Moreover, the change of the color of\r\nthis lake is wonderful, for it changes its appearance thrice every\r\nday; and as the rays of the sun fall differently upon it, the light is\r\nvariously reflected. However, it casts up black clods of bitumen in many\r\nparts of it; these swim at the top of the water, and resemble both in\r\nshape and bigness headless bulls; and when the laborers that belong to\r\nthe lake come to it, and catch hold of it as it hangs together, they\r\ndraw it into their ships; but when the ship is full, it is not easy to\r\ncut off the rest, for it is so tenacious as to make the ship hang upon\r\nits clods till they set it loose with the menstrual blood of women, and\r\nwith urine, to which alone it yields. This bitumen is not only\r\nuseful for the caulking of ships, but for the cure of men's bodies;\r\naccordingly, it is mixed in a great many medicines. The length of this\r\nlake is five hundred and eighty furlongs, where it is extended as far as\r\nZoar in Arabia; and its breadth is a hundred and fifty. The country of\r\nSodom borders upon it. It was of old a most happy land, both for the\r\nfruits it bore and the riches of its cities, although it be now all\r\nburnt up. It is related how, for the impiety of its inhabitants, it\r\nwas burnt by lightning; in consequence of which there are still the\r\nremainders of that Divine fire, and the traces [or shadows] of the\r\nfive cities are still to be seen, as well as the ashes growing in their\r\nfruits; which fruits have a color as if they were fit to be eaten, but\r\nif you pluck them with your hands, they dissolve into smoke and ashes.\r\nAnd thus what is related of this land of Sodom hath these marks of\r\ncredibility which our very sight affords us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n     That Vespasian, After He Had Taken Gadara Made Preparation\r\n     For The Siege Of Jerusalem; But That, Upon His Hearing Of\r\n     The Death Of Nero, He Changed His Intentions. As Also\r\n     Concerning Simon Of Geras.\r\n\r\n1. And now Vespasian had fortified all the places round about Jerusalem,\r\nand erected citadels at Jericho and Adida, and placed garrisons in them\r\nboth, partly out of his own Romans, and partly out of the body of his\r\nauxiliaries. He also sent Lucius Annius to Gerasa, and delivered to him\r\na body of horsemen, and a considerable number of footmen. So when he had\r\ntaken the city, which he did at the first onset, he slew a thousand of\r\nthose young men who had not prevented him by flying away; but he took\r\ntheir families captive, and permitted his soldiers to plunder them of\r\ntheir effects; after which he set fire to their houses, and went away to\r\nthe adjoining villages, while the men of power fled away, and the weaker\r\npart were destroyed, and what was remaining was all burnt down. And now\r\nthe war having gone through all the mountainous country, and all the\r\nplain country also, those that were at Jerusalem were deprived of\r\nthe liberty of going out of the city; for as to such as had a mind to\r\ndesert, they were watched by the zealots; and as to such as were not yet\r\non the side of the Romans, their army kept them in, by encompassing the\r\ncity round about on all sides.\r\n\r\n2. Now as Vespasian was returned to Cesarea, and was getting ready with\r\nall his army to march directly to Jerusalem, he was informed that Nero\r\nwas dead, after he had reigned thirteen years and eight days. But as to\r\nany narration after what manner he abused his power in the government,\r\nand committed the management of affairs to those vile wretches,\r\nNymphidius and Tigellinus, his unworthy freed-men; and how he had a plot\r\nlaid against him by them, and was deserted by all his guards, and ran\r\naway with four of his most trusty freed-men, and slew himself in the\r\nsuburbs of Rome; and how those that occasioned his death were in no long\r\ntime brought themselves to punishment; how also the war in Gall ended;\r\nand how Galba was made emperor 16 and returned out of Spain to Rome; and\r\nhow he was accused by the soldiers as a pusillanimous person, and slain\r\nby treachery in the middle of the market-place at Rome, and Otho was\r\nmade emperor; with his expedition against the commanders of Vitellius,\r\nand his destruction thereupon; and besides what troubles there were\r\nunder Vitellius, and the fight that was about the capitol; as also how\r\nAntonius Primus and Mucianus slew Vitellius, and his German legions, and\r\nthereby put an end to that civil war; I have omitted to give an exact\r\naccount of them, because they are well known by all, and they are\r\ndescribed by a great number of Greek and Roman authors; yet for the sake\r\nof the connexion of matters, and that my history may not be incoherent,\r\nI have just touched upon every thing briefly. Wherefore Vespasian put\r\noff at first his expedition against Jerusalem, and stood waiting whither\r\nthe empire would be transferred after the death of Nero. Moreover, when\r\nhe heard that Galba was made emperor, he attempted nothing till he also\r\nshould send him some directions about the war: however, he sent his son\r\nTitus to him, to salute him, and to receive his commands about the Jews.\r\nUpon the very same errand did king Agrippa sail along with Titus to\r\nGalba; but as they were sailing in their long ships by the coasts of\r\nAchaia, for it was winter time, they heard that Galba was slain, before\r\nthey could get to him, after he had reigned seven months and as many\r\ndays. After whom Otho took the government, and undertook the management\r\nof public affairs. So Agrippa resolved to go on to Rome without any\r\nterror; on account of the change in the government; but Titus, by a\r\nDivine impulse, sailed back from Greece to Syria, and came in great\r\nhaste to Cesarea, to his father. And now they were both in suspense\r\nabout the public affairs, the Roman empire being then in a fluctuating\r\ncondition, and did not go on with their expedition against the Jews, but\r\nthought that to make any attack upon foreigners was now unseasonable, on\r\naccount of the solicitude they were in for their own country.\r\n\r\n3. And now there arose another war at Jerusalem. There was a son of\r\nGiora, one Simon, by birth of Gerasa, a young man, not so cunning\r\nindeed as John [of Gisehala], who had already seized upon the city, but\r\nsuperior in strength of body and courage; on which account, when he had\r\nbeen driven away from that Acrabattene toparchy, which he once had, by\r\nAnanus the high priest, he came to those robbers who had seized upon\r\nMasada. At the first they suspected him, and only permitted him to come\r\nwith the women he brought with him into the lower part of the fortress,\r\nwhile they dwelt in the upper part of it themselves. However, his manner\r\nso well agreed with theirs, and he seemed so trusty a man, that he went\r\nout with them, and ravaged and destroyed the country with them about\r\nMasada; yet when he persuaded them to undertake greater things, he could\r\nnot prevail with them so to do; for as they were accustomed to dwell in\r\nthat citadel, they were afraid of going far from that which was\r\ntheir hiding-place; but he affecting to tyrannize, and being fond of\r\ngreatness, when he had heard of the death of Ananus, he left them, and\r\nwent into the mountainous part of the country. So he proclaimed liberty\r\nto those in slavery, and a reward to those already free, and got\r\ntogether a set of wicked men from all quarters.\r\n\r\n4. And as he had now a strong body of men about him, he overran the\r\nvillages that lay in the mountainous country, and when there were still\r\nmore and more that came to him, he ventured to go down into the lower\r\nparts of the country, and since he was now become formidable to the\r\ncities, many of the men of power were corrupted by him; so that his army\r\nwas no longer composed of slaves and robbers, but a great many of the\r\npopulace were obedient to him as to their king. He then overran the\r\nAcrabattene toparchy, and the places that reached as far as the Great\r\nIdumea; for he built a wall at a certain village called Nain, and made\r\nuse of that as a fortress for his own party's security; and at the\r\nvalley called Paran, he enlarged many of the caves, and many others he\r\nfound ready for his purpose; these he made use of as repositories for\r\nhis treasures, and receptacles for his prey, and therein he laid up the\r\nfruits that he had got by rapine; and many of his partizans had their\r\ndwelling in them; and he made no secret of it that he was exercising his\r\nmen beforehand, and making preparations for the assault of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n5. Whereupon the zealots, out of the dread they were in of his attacking\r\nthem, and being willing to prevent one that was growing up to oppose\r\nthem, went out against him with their weapons. Simon met them, and\r\njoining battle with them, slew a considerable number of them, and drove\r\nthe rest before him into the city, but durst not trust so much upon his\r\nforces as to make an assault upon the walls; but he resolved first to\r\nsubdue Idumea, and as he had now twenty thousand armed men, he marched\r\nto the borders of their country. Hereupon the rulers of the Idumeans\r\ngot together on the sudden the most warlike part of their people, about\r\ntwenty-five thousand in number, and permitted the rest to be a guard\r\nto their own country, by reason of the incursions that were made by the\r\nSicarii that were at Masada. Thus they received Simon at their borders,\r\nwhere they fought him, and continued the battle all that day; and the\r\ndispute lay whether they had conquered him, or been conquered by him. So\r\nhe went back to Nain, as did the Idumeans return home. Nor was it long\r\nere Simon came violently again upon their country; when he pitched his\r\ncamp at a certain village called Thecoe, and sent Eleazar, one of his\r\ncompanions, to those that kept garrison at Herodium, and in order to\r\npersuade them to surrender that fortress to him. The garrison received\r\nthis man readily, while they knew nothing of what he came about; but as\r\nsoon as he talked of the surrender of the place, they fell upon him with\r\ntheir drawn swords, till he found that he had no place for flight, when\r\nhe threw himself down from the wall into the valley beneath; so he died\r\nimmediately: but the Idumeans, who were already much afraid of Simon's\r\npower, thought fit to take a view of the enemy's army before they\r\nhazarded a battle with them.\r\n\r\n6. Now there was one of their commanders named Jacob, who offered to\r\nserve them readily upon that occasion, but had it in his mind to betray\r\nthem. He went therefore from the village Alurus, wherein the army of the\r\nIdumeans were gotten together, and came to Simon, and at the very first\r\nhe agreed to betray his country to him, and took assurances upon oath\r\nfrom him that he should always have him in esteem, and then promised him\r\nthat he would assist him in subduing all Idumea under him; upon which\r\naccount he was feasted after an obliging manner by Simon, and elevated\r\nby his mighty promises; and when he was returned to his own men, he at\r\nfirst belied the army of Simon, and said it was manifold more in number\r\nthan what it was; after which, he dexterously persuaded the commanders,\r\nand by degrees the whole multitude, to receive Simon, and to surrender\r\nthe whole government up to him without fighting. And as he was doing\r\nthis, he invited Simon by his messengers, and promised him to disperse\r\nthe Idumeans, which he performed also; for as soon as their army was\r\nnigh them, he first of all got upon his horse, and fled, together with\r\nthose whom he had corrupted; hereupon a terror fell upon the whole\r\nmultitude; and before it came to a close fight, they broke their ranks,\r\nand every one retired to his own home.\r\n\r\n7. Thus did Simon unexpectedly march into Idumea, without bloodshed, and\r\nmade a sudden attack upon the city Hebron, and took it; wherein he got\r\npossession of a great deal of prey, and plundered it of a vast quantity\r\nof fruit. Now the people of the country say that it is an ancienter\r\ncity, not only than any in that country, but than Memphis in Egypt, and\r\naccordingly its age is reckoned at two thousand and three hundred\r\nyears. They also relate that it had been the habitation of Abram, the\r\nprogenitor of the Jews, after he had removed out of Mesopotamia; and\r\nthey say that his posterity descended from thence into Egypt, whose\r\nmonuments are to this very time showed in that small city; the fabric of\r\nwhich monuments are of the most excellent marble, and wrought after the\r\nmost elegant manner. There is also there showed, at the distance of six\r\nfurlongs from the city, a very large turpentine tree 17 and the report\r\ngoes, that this tree has continued ever since the creation of the world.\r\nThence did Simon make his progress over all Idumea, and did not only\r\nravage the cities and villages, but lay waste the whole country; for,\r\nbesides those that were completely armed, he had forty thousand men that\r\nfollowed him, insomuch that he had not provisions enough to suffice such\r\na multitude. Now, besides this want of provisions that he was in, he\r\nwas of a barbarous disposition, and bore great anger at this nation, by\r\nwhich means it came to pass that Idumea was greatly depopulated; and as\r\none may see all the woods behind despoiled of their leaves by locusts,\r\nafter they have been there, so was there nothing left behind Simon's\r\narmy but a desert. Some places they burnt down, some they utterly\r\ndemolished, and whatsoever grew in the country, they either trod it\r\ndown or fed upon it, and by their marches they made the ground that was\r\ncultivated harder and more untractable than that which was barren. In\r\nshort, there was no sign remaining of those places that had been laid\r\nwaste, that ever they had had a being.\r\n\r\n8. This success of Simon excited the zealots afresh; and though they\r\nwere afraid to fight him openly in a fair battle, yet did they lay\r\nambushes in the passes, and seized upon his wife, with a considerable\r\nnumber of her attendants; whereupon they came back to the city\r\nrejoicing, as if they had taken Simon himself captive, and were\r\nin present expectation that he would lay down his arms, and make\r\nsupplication to them for his wife; but instead of indulging any merciful\r\naffection, he grew very angry at them for seizing his beloved wife; so\r\nhe came to the wall of Jerusalem, and, like wild beasts when they are\r\nwounded, and cannot overtake those that wounded them, he vented his\r\nspleen upon all persons that he met with. Accordingly, he caught all\r\nthose that were come out of the city gates, either to gather herbs\r\nor sticks, who were unarmed and in years; he then tormented them and\r\ndestroyed them, out of the immense rage he was in, and was almost ready\r\nto taste the very flesh of their dead bodies. He also cut off the hands\r\nof a great many, and sent them into the city to astonish his enemies,\r\nand in order to make the people fall into a sedition, and desert those\r\nthat had been the authors of his wife's seizure. He also enjoined them\r\nto tell the people that Simon swore by the God of the universe, who sees\r\nall things, that unless they will restore him his wife, he will break\r\ndown their wall, and inflict the like punishment upon all the citizens,\r\nwithout sparing any age, and without making any distinction between the\r\nguilty and the innocent. These threatenings so greatly affrighted, not\r\nthe people only, but the zealots themselves also, that they sent his\r\nwife back to him; when he became a little milder, and left off his\r\nperpetual blood-shedding.\r\n\r\n9. But now sedition and civil war prevailed, not only over Judea, but\r\nin Italy also; for now Galba was slain in the midst of the Roman\r\nmarket-place; then was Otho made emperor, and fought against Vitellius,\r\nwho set up for emperor also; for the legions in Germany had chosen him.\r\nBut when he gave battle to Valens and Cecinna, who were Vitellius's\r\ngenerals, at Betriacum, in Gaul, Otho gained the advantage on the first\r\nday, but on the second day Vitellius's soldiers had the victory; and\r\nafter much slaughter Otho slew himself, when he had heard of this defeat\r\nat Brixia, and after he had managed the public affairs three months and\r\ntwo days. 18 Otho's army also came over to Vitellius's generals, and he\r\ncame himself down to Rome with his army. But in the mean time Vespasian\r\nremoved from Cesarea, on the fifth day of the month Desius, [Sivan,] and\r\nmarched against those places of Judea which were not yet overthrown.\r\nSo he went up to the mountainous country, and took those two toparchies\r\nthat were called the Gophnitick and Acrabattene toparchies. After\r\nwhich he took Bethel and Ephraim, two small cities; and when he had put\r\ngarrisons into them, he rode as far as Jerusalem, in which march he took\r\nmany prisoners, and many captives; but Cerealis, one of his commanders,\r\ntook a body of horsemen and footmen, and laid waste that part of\r\nIdumea which was called the Upper Idumea, and attacked Caphethra, which\r\npretended to be a small city, and took it at the first onset, and burnt\r\nit down. He also attacked Caphatabira, and laid siege to it, for it had\r\na very strong wall; and when he expected to spend a long time in that\r\nsiege, those that were within opened their gates on the sudden, and came\r\nto beg pardon, and surrendered themselves up to him. When Cerealis had\r\nconquered them, he went to Hebron, another very ancient city. I have\r\ntold you already that this city is situated in a mountainous country not\r\nfar off Jerusalem; and when he had broken into the city by force, what\r\nmultitude and young men were left therein he slew, and burnt down the\r\ncity; so that as now all the places were taken, excepting Herodlum, and\r\nMasada, and Machaerus, which were in the possession of the robbers, so\r\nJerusalem was what the Romans at present aimed at.\r\n\r\n10. And now, as soon as Simon had set his wife free, and recovered her\r\nfrom the zealots, he returned back to the remainders of Idumea, and\r\ndriving the nation all before him from all quarters, he compelled a\r\ngreat number of them to retire to Jerusalem; he followed them himself\r\nalso to the city, and encompassed the wall all round again; and when he\r\nlighted upon any laborers that were coming thither out of the country,\r\nhe slew them. Now this Simon, who was without the wall, was a greater\r\nterror to the people than the Romans themselves, as were the zealots who\r\nwere within it more heavy upon them than both of the other; and during\r\nthis time did the mischievous contrivances and courage [of John] corrupt\r\nthe body of the Galileans; for these Galileans had advanced this John,\r\nand made him very potent, who made them suitable requital from the\r\nauthority he had obtained by their means; for he permitted them to do\r\nall things that any of them desired to do, while their inclination to\r\nplunder was insatiable, as was their zeal in searching the houses of the\r\nrich; and for the murdering of the men, and abusing of the women, it was\r\nsport to them. They also devoured what spoils they had taken, together\r\nwith their blood, and indulged themselves in feminine wantonness,\r\nwithout any disturbance, till they were satiated therewith; while they\r\ndecked their hair, and put on women's garments, and were besmeared over\r\nwith ointments; and that they might appear very comely, they had paints\r\nunder their eyes, and imitated not only the ornaments, but also the\r\nlusts of women, and were guilty of such intolerable uncleanness, that\r\nthey invented unlawful pleasures of that sort. And thus did they roll\r\nthemselves up and down the city, as in a brothel-house, and defiled it\r\nentirely with their impure actions; nay, while their faces looked like\r\nthe faces of women, they killed with their right hands; and when their\r\ngait was effeminate, they presently attacked men, and became warriors,\r\nand drew their swords from under their finely dyed cloaks, and ran every\r\nbody through whom they alighted upon. However, Simon waited for such as\r\nran away from John, and was the more bloody of the two; and he who had\r\nescaped the tyrant within the wall was destroyed by the other that lay\r\nbefore the gates, so that all attempts of flying and deserting to the\r\nRomans were cut off, as to those that had a mind so to do.\r\n\r\n11. Yet did the army that was under John raise a sedition against him,\r\nand all the Idumeans separated themselves from the tyrant, and attempted\r\nto destroy him, and this out of their envy at his power, and hatred of\r\nhis cruelty; so they got together, and slew many of the zealots, and\r\ndrove the rest before them into that royal palace that was built by\r\nGrapte, who was a relation of Izates, the king of Adiabene; the Idumeans\r\nfell in with them, and drove the zealots out thence into the temple, and\r\nbetook themselves to plunder John's effects; for both he himself was in\r\nthat palace, and therein had he laid up the spoils he had acquired by\r\nhis tyranny. In the mean time, the multitude of those zealots that were\r\ndispersed over the city ran together to the temple unto those that fled\r\nthither, and John prepared to bring them down against the people and the\r\nIdumeans, who were not so much afraid of being attacked by them [because\r\nthey were themselves better soldiers than they] as at their madness,\r\nlest they should privately sally out of the temple and get among them,\r\nand not only destroy them, but set the city on fire also. So they\r\nassembled themselves together, and the high priests with them, and took\r\ncounsel after what manner they should avoid their assault. Now it was\r\nGod who turned their opinions to the worst advice, and thence they\r\ndevised such a remedy to get themselves free as was worse than the\r\ndisease itself. Accordingly, in order to overthrow John, they determined\r\nto admit Simon, and earnestly to desire the introduction of a second\r\ntyrant into the city; which resolution they brought to perfection, and\r\nsent Matthias, the high priest, to beseech this Simon to come in to\r\nthem, of whom they had so often been afraid. Those also that had fled\r\nfrom the zealots in Jerusalem joined in this request to him, out of\r\nthe desire they had of preserving their houses and their effects.\r\nAccordingly he, in an arrogant manner, granted them his lordly\r\nprotection, and came into the city, in order to deliver it from the\r\nzealots. The people also made joyful acclamations to him, as their\r\nsavior and their preserver; but when he was come in, with his army, he\r\ntook care to secure his own authority, and looked upon those that had\r\ninvited him in to be no less his enemies than those against whom the\r\ninvitation was intended.\r\n\r\n12. And thus did Simon get possession of Jerusalem, in the third year\r\nof the war, in the month Xanthicus [Nisan]; whereupon John, with his\r\nmultitude of zealots, as being both prohibited from coming out of the\r\ntemple, and having lost their power in the city, [for Simon and\r\nhis party had plundered them of what they had,] were in despair of\r\ndeliverance. Simon also made an assault upon the temple, with the\r\nassistance of the people, while the others stood upon the cloisters and\r\nthe battlements, and defended themselves from their assaults. However,\r\na considerable number of Simon's party fell, and many were carried off\r\nwounded; for the zealots threw their darts easily from a superior place,\r\nand seldom failed of hitting their enemies; but having the advantage of\r\nsituation, and having withal erected four very large towers aforehand,\r\nthat their darts might come from higher places, one at the north-east\r\ncorner of the court, one above the Xystus, the third at another corner\r\nover against the lower city, and the last was erected above the top of\r\nthe Pastophoria, where one of the priests stood of course, and gave a\r\nsignal beforehand, with a trumpet 19 at the beginning of every seventh\r\nday, in the evening twilight, as also at the evening when that day was\r\nfinished, as giving notice to the people when they were to leave off\r\nwork, and when they were to go to work again. These men also set their\r\nengines to cast darts and stones withal, upon those towers, with their\r\narchers and slingers. And now Simon made his assault upon the temple\r\nmore faintly, by reason that the greatest part of his men grew weary of\r\nthat work; yet did he not leave off his opposition, because his army\r\nwas superior to the others, although the darts which were thrown by the\r\nengines were carried a great way, and slew many of those that fought for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The Soldiers, Both In Judea And Egypt, Proclaimed\r\n     Vespasian Emperor; And How Vespasian Released Josephus From\r\n     His Bonds.\r\n\r\n1. Now about this very time it was that heavy calamities came about Rome\r\non all sides; for Vitellius was come from Germany with his soldiery, and\r\ndrew along with him a great multitude of other men besides. And when the\r\nspaces allotted for soldiers could not contain them, he made all Rome\r\nitself his camp, and filled all the houses with his armed men; which\r\nmen, when they saw the riches of Rome with those eyes which had never\r\nseen such riches before, and found themselves shone round about on all\r\nsides with silver and gold, they had much ado to contain their covetous\r\ndesires, and were ready to betake themselves to plunder, and to the\r\nslaughter of such as should stand in their way. And this was the state\r\nof affairs in Italy at that time.\r\n\r\n2. But when Vespasian had overthrown all the places that were near to\r\nJerusalem, he returned to Cesarea, and heard of the troubles that were\r\nat Rome, and that Vitellius was emperor. This produced indignation in\r\nhim, although he well knew how to be governed as well as to govern,\r\nand could not, with any satisfaction, own him for his lord who acted so\r\nmadly, and seized upon the government as if it were absolutely destitute\r\nof a governor. And as this sorrow of his was violent, he was not able to\r\nsupport the torments he was under, nor to apply himself further in other\r\nwars, when his native country was laid waste; but then, as much as his\r\npassion excited him to avenge his country, so much was he restrained\r\nby the consideration of his distance therefrom; because fortune might\r\nprevent him, and do a world of mischief before he could himself sail\r\nover the sea to Italy, especially as it was still the winter season; so\r\nhe restrained his anger, how vehement soever it was at this time.\r\n\r\n3. But now his commanders and soldiers met in several companies, and\r\nconsulted openly about changing the public affairs; and, out of their\r\nindignation, cried out, how \"at Rome there are soldiers that live\r\ndelicately, and when they have not ventured so much as to hear the fame\r\nof war, they ordain whom they please for our governors, and in hopes\r\nof gain make them emperors; while you, who have gone through so many\r\nlabors, and are grown into years under your helmets, give leave to\r\nothers to use such a power, when yet you have among yourselves one\r\nmore worthy to rule than any whom they have set up. Now what juster\r\nopportunity shall they ever have of requiting their generals, if they\r\ndo not make use of this that is now before them? while there is so much\r\njuster reasons for Vespasian's being emperor than for Vitellius; as they\r\nare themselves more deserving than those that made the other emperors;\r\nfor that they have undergone as great wars as have the troops that come\r\nfrom Germany; nor are they inferior in war to those that have brought\r\nthat tyrant to Rome, nor have they undergone smaller labors than\r\nthey; for that neither will the Roman senate, nor people, bear such a\r\nlascivious emperor as Vitellius, if he be compared with their chaste\r\nVespasian; nor will they endure a most barbarous tyrant, instead of\r\na good governor, nor choose one that hath no child 20 to preside over\r\nthem, instead of him that is a father; because the advancement of men's\r\nown children to dignities is certainly the greatest security kings can\r\nhave for themselves. Whether, therefore, we estimate the capacity\r\nof governing from the skill of a person in years, we ought to have\r\nVespasian, or whether from the strength of a young man, we ought to have\r\nTitus; for by this means we shall have the advantage of both their ages,\r\nfor that they will afford strength to those that shall be made emperors,\r\nthey having already three legions, besides other auxiliaries from the\r\nneighboring kings, and will have further all the armies in the east to\r\nsupport them, as also those in Europe, so they as they are out of the\r\ndistance and dread of Vitellius, besides such auxiliaries as they may\r\nhave in Italy itself; that is, Vespasian's brother, 21 and his other son\r\n[Domitian]; the one of whom will bring in a great many of those\r\nyoung men that are of dignity, while the other is intrusted with the\r\ngovernment of the city, which office of his will be no small means of\r\nVespasian's obtaining the government. Upon the whole, the case may be\r\nsuch, that if we ourselves make further delays, the senate may choose an\r\nemperor, whom the soldiers, who are the saviors of the empire, will have\r\nin contempt.\"\r\n\r\n4. These were the discourses the soldiers had in their several\r\ncompanies; after which they got together in a great body, and,\r\nencouraging one another, they declared Vespasian emperor, 22 and\r\nexhorted him to save the government, which was now in danger. Now\r\nVespasian's concern had been for a considerable time about the public,\r\nyet did he not intend to set up for governor himself, though his actions\r\nshowed him to deserve it, while he preferred that safety which is in a\r\nprivate life before the dangers in a state of such dignity; but when he\r\nrefused the empire, the commanders insisted the more earnestly upon his\r\nacceptance; and the soldiers came about him, with their drawn swords\r\nin their hands, and threatened to kill him, unless he would now live\r\naccording to his dignity. And when he had shown his reluctance a great\r\nwhile, and had endeavored to thrust away this dominion from him, he at\r\nlength, being not able to persuade them, yielded to their solicitations\r\nthat would salute him emperor.\r\n\r\n5. So upon the exhortations of Mucianus, and the other commanders, that\r\nhe would accept of the empire, and upon that of the rest of the army,\r\nwho cried out that they were willing to be led against all his opposers,\r\nhe was in the first place intent upon gaining the dominion over\r\nAlexandria, as knowing that Egypt was of the greatest consequence, in\r\norder to obtain the entire government, because of its supplying of corn\r\n[to Rome]; which corn, if he could be master of, he hoped to dethrone\r\nVitellius, supposing he should aim to keep the empire by force [for he\r\nwould not be able to support himself, if the multitude at Rome should\r\nonce be in want of food]; and because he was desirous to join the two\r\nlegions that were at Alexandria to the other legions that were with him.\r\nHe also considered with himself, that he should then have that country\r\nfor a defense to himself against the uncertainty of fortune; for Egypt\r\n23 is hard to be entered by land, and hath no good havens by sea. It\r\nhath on the west the dry deserts of Libya; and on the south Siene, that\r\ndivides it from Ethiopia, as well as the cataracts of the Nile, that\r\ncannot be sailed over; and on the east the Red Sea extended as far as\r\nCoptus; and it is fortified on the north by the land that reaches to\r\nSyria, together with that called the Egyptian Sea, having no havens in\r\nit for ships. And thus is Egypt walled about on every side. Its length\r\nbetween Pelusium and Siene is two thousand furlongs, and the passage by\r\nsea from Plinthine to Pelusium is three thousand six hundred furlongs.\r\nIts river Nile is navigable as far as the city called Elephantine, the\r\nforenamed cataracts hindering ships from going any farther, The haven\r\nalso of Alexandria is not entered by the mariners without difficulty,\r\neven in times of peace; for the passage inward is narrow, and full of\r\nrocks that lie under the water, which oblige the mariners to turn from\r\na straight direction: its left side is blocked up by works made by men's\r\nhands on both sides; on its right side lies the island called Pharus,\r\nwhich is situated just before the entrance, and supports a very great\r\ntower, that affords the sight of a fire to such as sail within three\r\nhundred furlongs of it, that ships may cast anchor a great way off in\r\nthe night time, by reason of the difficulty of sailing nearer. About\r\nthis island are built very great piers, the handiwork of men, against\r\nwhich, when the sea dashes itself, and its waves are broken against\r\nthose boundaries, the navigation becomes very troublesome, and the\r\nentrance through so narrow a passage is rendered dangerous; yet is the\r\nhaven itself, when you are got into it, a very safe one, and of thirty\r\nfurlongs in largeness; into which is brought what the country wants in\r\norder to its happiness, as also what abundance the country affords more\r\nthan it wants itself is hence distributed into all the habitable earth.\r\n\r\n6. Justly, therefore, did Vespasian desire to obtain that government,\r\nin order to corroborate his attempts upon the whole empire; so he\r\nimmediately sent to Tiberius Alexander, who was then governor of Egypt\r\nand of Alexandria, and informed him what the army had put upon him,\r\nand how he, being forced to accept of the burden of the government, was\r\ndesirous to have him for his confederate and supporter. Now as soon as\r\never Alexander had read this letter, he readily obliged the legions\r\nand the multitude to take the oath of fidelity to Vespasian, both which\r\nwillingly complied with him, as already acquainted with the courage\r\nof the man, from that his conduct in their neighborhood. Accordingly\r\nVespasian, looking upon himself as already intrusted with the\r\ngovernment, got all things ready for his journey [to Rome]. Now fame\r\ncarried this news abroad more suddenly than one could have thought, that\r\nhe was emperor over the east, upon which every city kept festivals, and\r\ncelebrated sacrifices and oblations for such good news; the legions\r\nalso that were in Mysia and Pannonia, who had been in commotion a little\r\nbefore, on account of this insolent attempt of Vitellius, were very\r\nglad to take the oath of fidelity to Vespasian, upon his coming to\r\nthe empire. Vespasian then removed from Cesarea to Berytus, where\r\nmany embassages came to him from Syria, and many from other provinces,\r\nbringing with them from every city crowns, and the congratulations of\r\nthe people. Mucianus came also, who was the president of the province,\r\nand told him with what alacrity the people [received the news of his\r\nadvancement], and how the people of every city had taken the oath of\r\nfidelity to him.\r\n\r\n7. So Vespasian's good fortune succeeded to his wishes every where, and\r\nthe public affairs were, for the greatest part, already in his hands;\r\nupon which he considered that he had not arrived at the government\r\nwithout Divine Providence, but that a righteous kind of fate had brought\r\nthe empire under his power; for as he called to mind the other signals,\r\nwhich had been a great many every where, that foretold he should obtain\r\nthe government, so did he remember what Josephus had said to him when he\r\nventured to foretell his coming to the empire while Nero was alive; so\r\nhe was much concerned that this man was still in bonds with him. He then\r\ncalled for Mucianus, together with his other commanders and friends,\r\nand, in the first place, he informed them what a valiant man Josephus\r\nhad been, and what great hardships he had made him undergo in the siege\r\nof Jotapata. After that he related those predictions of his 24 which he\r\nhad then suspected as fictions, suggested out of the fear he was in,\r\nbut which had by time been demonstrated to be Divine. \"It is a shameful\r\nthing [said he] that this man, who hath foretold my coming to the empire\r\nbeforehand, and been the minister of a Divine message to me, should\r\nstill be retained in the condition of a captive or prisoner.\" So he\r\ncalled for Josephus, and commanded that he should be set at liberty;\r\nwhereupon the commanders promised themselves glorious things, from this\r\nrequital Vespasian made to a stranger. Titus was then present with\r\nhis father, and said, \"O father, it is but just that the scandal [of a\r\nprisoner] should be taken off Josephus, together with his iron chain.\r\nFor if we do not barely loose his bonds, but cut them to pieces, he will\r\nbe like a man that had never been bound at all.\" For that is the usual\r\nmethod as to such as have been bound without a cause. This advice was\r\nagreed to by Vespasian also; so there came a man in, and cut the chain\r\nto pieces; while Josephus received this testimony of his integrity for\r\na reward, and was moreover esteemed a person of credit as to futurities\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n     That Upon The Conquest And Slaughter Of Vitellius Vespasian\r\n     Hastened His Journey To Rome; But Titus His Son Returned To\r\n     Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1. And now, when Vespasian had given answers to the embassages, and had\r\ndisposed of the places of power justly, 25 and according to every one's\r\ndeserts, he came to Antioch, and consulting which way he had best take,\r\nhe preferred to go for Rome, rather than to march to Alexandria, because\r\nhe saw that Alexandria was sure to him already, but that the affairs at\r\nRome were put into disorder by Vitellius; so he sent Mucianus to Italy,\r\nand committed a considerable army both of horsemen and footmen to him;\r\nyet was Mucianus afraid of going by sea, because it was the middle of\r\nwinter, and so he led his army on foot through Cappadocia and Phrygia.\r\n\r\n2. In the mean time, Antonius Primus took the third of the legions that\r\nwere in Mysia, for he was president of that province, and made haste, in\r\norder to fight Vitellius; whereupon Vitellius sent away Cecinna, with\r\na great army, having a mighty confidence in him, because of his having\r\nbeaten Otho. This Cecinna marched out of Rome in great haste, and found\r\nAntonius about Cremona in Gall, which city is in the borders of Italy;\r\nbut when he saw there that the enemy were numerous and in good order, he\r\ndurst not fight them; and as he thought a retreat dangerous, so he began\r\nto think of betraying his army to Antonius. Accordingly, he assembled\r\nthe centurions and tribunes that were under his command, and persuaded\r\nthem to go over to Antonius, and this by diminishing the reputation of\r\nVitellius, and by exaggerating the power of Vespasian. He also told them\r\nthat with the one there was no more than the bare name of dominion, but\r\nwith the other was the power of it; and that it was better for them to\r\nprevent necessity, and gain favor, and, while they were likely to be\r\novercome in battle, to avoid the danger beforehand, and go over to\r\nAntonius willingly; that Vespasian was able of himself to subdue what\r\nhad not yet submitted without their assistance, while Vitellius could\r\nnot preserve what he had already with it.\r\n\r\n3. Cecinna said this, and much more to the same purpose, and persuaded\r\nthem to comply with him; and both he and his army deserted; but still\r\nthe very same night the soldiers repented of what they had done, and a\r\nfear seized on them, lest perhaps Vitellius who sent them should get the\r\nbetter; and drawing their swords, they assaulted Cecinna, in order to\r\nkill him; and the thing had been done by them, if the tribunes had not\r\nfallen upon their knees, and besought them not to do it; so the soldiers\r\ndid not kill him, but put him in bonds, as a traitor, and were about to\r\nsend him to Vitellius. When [Antonius] Primus heard of this, he raised\r\nup his men immediately, and made them put on their armor, and led them\r\nagainst those that had revolted; hereupon they put themselves in order\r\nof battle, and made a resistance for a while, but were soon beaten, and\r\nfled to Cremona; then did Primus take his horsemen, and cut off their\r\nentrance into the city, and encompassed and destroyed a great multitude\r\nof them before the city, and fell into the city together with the rest,\r\nand gave leave to his soldiers to plunder it. And here it was that many\r\nstrangers, who were merchants, as well as many of the people of that\r\ncountry, perished, and among them Vitellius's whole army, being thirty\r\nthousand and two hundred, while Antonius lost no more of those that came\r\nwith him from Mysia than four thousand and five hundred: he then loosed\r\nCecinna, and sent him to Vespasian to tell him the good news. So he\r\ncame, and was received by him, and covered the scandal of his treachery\r\nby the unexpected honors he received from Vespasian.\r\n\r\n4. And now, upon the news that Antonius was approaching, Sabinus took\r\ncourage at Rome, and assembled those cohorts of soldiers that kept watch\r\nby night, and in the night time seized upon the capitol; and, as the\r\nday came on, many men of character came over to him, with Domitian,\r\nhis brother's son, whose encouragement was of very great weight for the\r\ncompassing the government. Now Vitellius was not much concerned at this\r\nPrimus, but was very angry with those that had revolted with Sabinus;\r\nand thirsting, out of his own natural barbarity, after noble blood,\r\nhe sent out that part of the army which came along with him to fight\r\nagainst the capitol; and many bold actions were done on this side, and\r\non the side of those that held the temple. But at last, the soldiers\r\nthat came from Germany, being too numerous for the others, got the hill\r\ninto their possession, where Domitian, with many other of the principal\r\nRomans, providentially escaped, while the rest of the multitude were\r\nentirely cut to pieces, and Sabinus himself was brought to Vitellius,\r\nand then slain; the soldiers also plundered the temple of its ornaments,\r\nand set it on fire. But now within a day's time came Antonius, with his\r\narmy, and were met by Vitellius and his army; and having had a battle\r\nin three several places, the last were all destroyed. Then did Vitellius\r\ncome out of the palace, in his cups, and satiated with an extravagant\r\nand luxurious meal, as in the last extremity, and being drawn along\r\nthrough the multitude, and abused with all sorts of torments, had his\r\nhead cut off in the midst of Rome, having retained the government eight\r\nmonths and five days 26 and had he lived much longer, I cannot but think\r\nthe empire would not have been sufficient for his lust. Of the others\r\nthat were slain, were numbered above fifty thousand. This battle was\r\nfought on the third day of the month Apelleus [Casleu]; on the next day\r\nMucianus came into the city with his army, and ordered Antonius and his\r\nmen to leave off killing; for they were still searching the houses,\r\nand killed many of Vitellius's soldiers, and many of the populace, as\r\nsupposing them to be of his party, preventing by their rage any accurate\r\ndistinction between them and others. He then produced Domitian, and\r\nrecommended him to the multitude, until his father should come himself;\r\nso the people being now freed from their fears, made acclamations of\r\njoy for Vespasian, as for their emperor, and kept festival days for his\r\nconfirmation, and for the destruction of Vitellius.\r\n\r\n5. And now, as Vespasian was come to Alexandria, this good news\r\ncame from Rome, and at the same time came embassies from all his own\r\nhabitable earth, to congratulate him upon his advancement; and though\r\nthis Alexandria was the greatest of all cities next to Rome, it proved\r\ntoo narrow to contain the multitude that then came to it. So upon this\r\nconfirmation of Vespasian's entire government, which was now settled,\r\nand upon the unexpected deliverance of the public affairs of the Romans\r\nfrom ruin, Vespasian turned his thoughts to what remained unsubdued in\r\nJudea. However, he himself made haste to go to Rome, as the winter was\r\nnow almost over, and soon set the affairs of Alexandria in order,\r\nbut sent his son Titus, with a select part of his army, to destroy\r\nJerusalem. So Titus marched on foot as far as Nicopolis, which is\r\ndistant twenty furlongs from Alexandria; there he put his army on board\r\nsome long ships, and sailed upon the river along the Mendesian Nomus,\r\nas far as the city Tumuis; there he got out of the ships, and walked\r\non foot, and lodged all night at a small city called Tanis. His second\r\nstation was Heracleopolis, and his third Pelusium; he then refreshed his\r\narmy at that place for two days, and on the third passed over the mouths\r\nof the Nile at Pelusium; he then proceeded one station over the desert,\r\nand pitched his camp at the temple of the Casian Jupiter, 27 and on the\r\nnext day at Ostracine. This station had no water, but the people of\r\nthe country make use of water brought from other places. After this he\r\nrested at Rhinocolura, and from thence he went to Raphia, which was\r\nhis fourth station. This city is the beginning of Syria. For his fifth\r\nstation he pitched his camp at Gaza; after which he came to Ascalon, and\r\nthence to Jamnia, and after that to Joppa, and from Joppa to Cesarea,\r\nhaving taken a resolution to gather all his other forces together at\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nWAR BOOK 4 FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Here we have the exact situation of Jeroboam's \"at the exit\r\nof Little Jordan into Great Jordan, near the place called Daphne,\" but\r\nof old Dan.

So I\r\nrather suppose Josephus wrote three furlongs for the ascent or altitude,\r\ninstead of thirty; and six furlongs for the circumference at the\r\ntop, instead of twenty-six,--since a mountain of only three furlongs\r\nperpendicular altitude may easily require near an hour's ascent, and the\r\ncircumference of an oval of the foregoing quantity is near six furlongs.\r\nNor certainly could such a vast circumference as twenty-six furlongs,\r\nor three miles and a quarter, at that height be encompassed with a\r\nwall, including a trench and other fortifications, [perhaps those still\r\nremaining, ibid.] in the small interval of forty days, as Josephus here\r\nsays they were by himself.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ This name Dorcas in Greek, was Tabitha in Hebrew or Syriac,\r\nas Acts 9:36. Accordingly, some of the manuscripts set it down here\r\nTabetha or Tabeta.

The names of these high priests, or rather ridiculous\r\nand profane persons, were Jesus the son of Damneus, Jesus the son of\r\nGamaliel, Matthias the son of Theophilus, and that prodigious ignoramus\r\nPhannias, the son of Samuel; all whom we shall meet with in Josephus's\r\nfuture history of this war; nor do we meet with any other so much as\r\npretended high priest after Phannias, till Jerusalem was taken and\r\ndestroyed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ This tribe or course of the high priests, or priests, here\r\ncalled Eniachim, seems to the learned Mr. Lowth, one well versed in\r\nJosephus, to be that 1 Chronicles 24:12, \"the course of Jakim,\" where\r\nsome copies have \"the course of Eliakim;\" and I think this to be by no\r\nmeans an improbable conjecture.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ This Symeon, the son of Gamaliel, is mentioned as the\r\npresident of the Jewish sanhedrim, and one that perished in the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem, by the Jewish Rabbins, as Reland observes on\r\nthis place. He also tells us that those Rabbins mention one Jesus\r\nthe son of Gamala, as once a high priest, but this long before the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem; so that if he were the same person with this\r\nJesus the son of Gamala, Josephus, he must have lived to be very old, or\r\nthey have been very bad chronologers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ It is worth noting here, that this Ananus, the best of the\r\nJews at this time, and the high priest, who was so very uneasy at the\r\nprofanation of the Jewish courts of the temple by the zealots, did not\r\nhowever scruple the profanation of the \"court of the Gentiles;\" as in\r\nour Savior's days it was very much profaned by the Jews; and made a\r\nmarket-place, nay, a \"den of thieves,\" without scruple, Matthew 21:12,\r\n13; Mark 11:15-17. Accordingly Josephus himself, when he speaks of the\r\ntwo inner courts, calls them both hagia or holy places; but, so far as\r\nI remember, never gives that character of the court of the Gentiles.

This is a somewhat strange exposition; since\r\nZechariah the prophet was really \"the son of Barachiah,\" and \"grandson\r\nof Iddo, Zechariah 1:1; and how he died, we have no other account than\r\nthat before us in St. Matthew: while this \"Zacharias\" was \"the son of\r\nBaruch.\" Since the slaughter was past when our Savior spake these\r\nwords, the Jews had then already slain him; whereas this slaughter of\r\n\"Zacharias, the son of Baruch,\" in Josephus, was then about thirty-four\r\nyears future.

V. ch. 1. sect. 2].\r\nNor do I believe that our Josephus, who always insists on the peculiar\r\nsacredness of the inmost court, and of the holy house that was in it,\r\nwould have omitted so material an aggravation of this barbarous murder,\r\nas perpetrated in. a place so very holy, had that been the true place of\r\nit.

I suppose the month they there\r\nintended was June, and not July, as the copies now have it; nor does\r\nTacitus's coherence imply less.

They were\r\nprobably some of them contemporary together for some time; one of the\r\nbest evidences we have, I mean Ptolemy's Canon, omits them all, as if\r\nthey did not all together reign one whole year, nor had a single Thoth,\r\nor new-year's day, [which then fell upon August 6,] in their entire\r\nreigns. Dio also, who says that Vitellius reigned a year within ten\r\ndays, does yet estimate all their reigns together at no more than one\r\nyear, one month, and two days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27 (return) [ There are coins of this Casian Jupiter still extant.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Containing The Interval Of Near Six Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n     From The Coming Of Titus To Besiege Jerusalem, To The Great\r\n     Extremity To Which The Jews Were Reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning The Seditions At Jerusalem And What Terrible\r\n     Miseries Afflicted The City By Their Means.\r\n\r\n1. When therefore Titus had marched over that desert which lies between\r\nEgypt and Syria, in the manner forementioned, he came to Cesarea, having\r\nresolved to set his forces in order at that place, before he began the\r\nwar. Nay, indeed, while he was assisting his father at Alexandria, in\r\nsettling that government which had been newly conferred upon them by\r\nGod, it so happened that the sedition at Jerusalem was revived, and\r\nparted into three factions, and that one faction fought against the\r\nother; which partition in such evil cases may be said to be a good\r\nthing, and the effect of Divine justice. Now as to the attack the\r\nzealots made upon the people, and which I esteem the beginning of the\r\ncity's destruction, it hath been already explained after an accurate\r\nmanner; as also whence it arose, and to how great a mischief it was\r\nincreased. But for the present sedition, one should not mistake if he\r\ncalled it a sedition begotten by another sedition, and to be like a\r\nwild beast grown mad, which, for want of food from abroad, fell now upon\r\neating its own flesh.\r\n\r\n2. For Eleazar, the son of Simon, who made the first separation of the\r\nzealots from the people, and made them retire into the temple, appeared\r\nvery angry at John's insolent attempts, which he made everyday upon the\r\npeople; for this man never left off murdering; but the truth was, that\r\nhe could not bear to submit to a tyrant who set up after him. So he\r\nbeing desirous of gaining the entire power and dominion to himself,\r\nrevolted from John, and took to his assistance Judas the son of\r\nChelcias, and Simon the son of Ezron, who were among the men of greatest\r\npower. There was also with him Hezekiah, the son of Chobar, a person of\r\neminence. Each of these were followed by a great many of the zealots;\r\nthese seized upon the inner court of the temple 1 and laid their arms\r\nupon the holy gates, and over the holy fronts of that court. And because\r\nthey had plenty of provisions, they were of good courage, for there\r\nwas a great abundance of what was consecrated to sacred uses, and they\r\nscrupled not the making use of them; yet were they afraid, on account of\r\ntheir small number; and when they had laid up their arms there, they did\r\nnot stir from the place they were in. Now as to John, what advantage\r\nhe had above Eleazar in the multitude of his followers, the like\r\ndisadvantage he had in the situation he was in, since he had his enemies\r\nover his head; and as he could not make any assault upon them without\r\nsome terror, so was his anger too great to let them be at rest; nay,\r\nalthough he suffered more mischief from Eleazar and his party than he\r\ncould inflict upon them, yet would he not leave off assaulting them,\r\ninsomuch that there were continual sallies made one against another, as\r\nwell as darts thrown at one another, and the temple was defiled every\r\nwhere with murders.\r\n\r\n3. But now the tyrant Simon, the son of Gioras, whom the people had\r\ninvited in, out of the hopes they had of his assistance in the great\r\ndistresses they were in, having in his power the upper city, and a great\r\npart of the lower, did now make more vehement assaults upon John and\r\nhis party, because they were fought against from above also; yet was he\r\nbeneath their situation when he attacked them, as they were beneath the\r\nattacks of the others above them. Whereby it came to pass that John did\r\nboth receive and inflict great damage, and that easily, as he was fought\r\nagainst on both sides; and the same advantage that Eleazar and his party\r\nhad over him, since he was beneath them, the same advantage had he, by\r\nhis higher situation, over Simon. On which account he easily repelled\r\nthe attacks that were made from beneath, by the weapons thrown from\r\ntheir hands only; but was obliged to repel those that threw their\r\ndarts from the temple above him, by his engines of war; for he had such\r\nengines as threw darts, and javelins, and stones, and that in no small\r\nnumber, by which he did not only defend himself from such as fought\r\nagainst him, but slew moreover many of the priests, as they were about\r\ntheir sacred ministrations. For notwithstanding these men were mad with\r\nall sorts of impiety, yet did they still admit those that desired to\r\noffer their sacrifices, although they took care to search the people of\r\ntheir own country beforehand, and both suspected and watched them; while\r\nthey were not so much afraid of strangers, who, although they had gotten\r\nleave of them, how cruel soever they were, to come into that court, were\r\nyet often destroyed by this sedition; for those darts that were thrown\r\nby the engines came with that force, that they went over all the\r\nbuildings, and reached as far as the altar, and the temple itself, and\r\nfell upon the priests, and those 2 that were about the sacred offices;\r\ninsomuch that many persons who came thither with great zeal from the\r\nends of the earth, to offer sacrifices at this celebrated place, which\r\nwas esteemed holy by all mankind, fell down before their own sacrifices\r\nthemselves, and sprinkled that altar which was venerable among all men,\r\nboth Greeks and Barbarians, with their own blood; till the dead bodies\r\nof strangers were mingled together with those of their own country, and\r\nthose of profane persons with those of the priests, and the blood of all\r\nsorts of dead carcasses stood in lakes in the holy courts themselves.\r\nAnd now, \"O most wretched city, what misery so great as this didst thou\r\nsuffer from the Romans, when they came to purify thee from thy intestine\r\nhatred! 'For thou couldst be no longer a place fit for God, nor couldst\r\nthou long continue in being, after thou hadst been a sepulcher for\r\nthe bodies of thy own people, and hadst made the holy house itself a\r\nburying-place in this civil war of thine. Yet mayst thou again grow\r\nbetter, if perchance thou wilt hereafter appease the anger of that God\r\nwho is the author of thy destruction.\" But I must restrain myself from\r\nthese passions by the rules of history, since this is not a proper time\r\nfor domestical lamentations, but for historical narrations; I therefore\r\nreturn to the operations that follow in this sedition. 3\r\n\r\n4. And now there were three treacherous factions in the city, the one\r\nparted from the other. Eleazar and his party, that kept the sacred\r\nfirst-fruits, came against John in their cups. Those that were with John\r\nplundered the populace, and went out with zeal against Simon. This\r\nSimon had his supply of provisions from the city, in opposition to the\r\nseditious. When, therefore, John was assaulted on both sides, he made\r\nhis men turn about, throwing his darts upon those citizens that came\r\nup against him, from the cloisters he had in his possession, while he\r\nopposed those that attacked him from the temple by his engines of war.\r\nAnd if at any time he was freed from those that were above him, which\r\nhappened frequently, from their being drunk and tired, he sallied out\r\nwith a great number upon Simon and his party; and this he did always in\r\nsuch parts of the city as he could come at, till he set on fire those\r\nhouses that were full of corn, and of all other provisions. 4 The same\r\nthing was done by Simon, when, upon the other's retreat, he attacked the\r\ncity also; as if they had, on purpose, done it to serve the Romans,\r\nby destroying what the city had laid up against the siege, and by thus\r\ncutting off the nerves of their own power. Accordingly, it so came to\r\npass, that all the places that were about the temple were burnt down,\r\nand were become an intermediate desert space, ready for fighting on both\r\nsides of it; and that almost all that corn was burnt, which would have\r\nbeen sufficient for a siege of many years. So they were taken by the\r\nmeans of the famine, which it was impossible they should have been,\r\nunless they had thus prepared the way for it by this procedure.\r\n\r\n5. And now, as the city was engaged in a war on all sides, from these\r\ntreacherous crowds of wicked men, the people of the city, between them,\r\nwere like a great body torn in pieces. The aged men and the women were\r\nin such distress by their internal calamities, that they wished for\r\nthe Romans, and earnestly hoped for an external war, in order to their\r\ndelivery from their domestical miseries. The citizens themselves were\r\nunder a terrible consternation and fear; nor had they any opportunity of\r\ntaking counsel, and of changing their conduct; nor were there any hopes\r\nof coming to an agreement with their enemies; nor could such as had a\r\nmind flee away; for guards were set at all places, and the heads of\r\nthe robbers, although they were seditious one against another in other\r\nrespects, yet did they agree in killing those that were for peace with\r\nthe Romans, or were suspected of an inclination to desert them, as their\r\ncommon enemies. They agreed in nothing but this, to kill those that were\r\ninnocent. The noise also of those that were fighting was incessant, both\r\nby day and by night; but the lamentations of those that mourned exceeded\r\nthe other; nor was there ever any occasion for them to leave off\r\ntheir lamentations, because their calamities came perpetually one upon\r\nanother, although the deep consternation they were in prevented their\r\noutward wailing; but being constrained by their fear to conceal their\r\ninward passions, they were inwardly tormented, without daring to open\r\ntheir lips in groans. Nor was any regard paid to those that were still\r\nalive, by their relations; nor was there any care taken of burial for\r\nthose that were dead; the occasion of both which was this, that every\r\none despaired of himself; for those that were not among the seditious\r\nhad no great desires of any thing, as expecting for certain that they\r\nshould very soon be destroyed; but for the seditious themselves, they\r\nfought against each other, while they trod upon the dead bodies as they\r\nlay heaped one upon another, and taking up a mad rage from those dead\r\nbodies that were under their feet, became the fiercer thereupon. They,\r\nmoreover, were still inventing somewhat or other that was pernicious\r\nagainst themselves; and when they had resolved upon any thing, they\r\nexecuted it without mercy, and omitted no method of torment or of\r\nbarbarity. Nay, John abused the sacred materials, 5 and employed them in\r\nthe construction of his engines of war; for the people and the priests\r\nhad formerly determined to support the temple, and raise the holy house\r\ntwenty cubits higher; for king Agrippa had at a very great expense, and\r\nwith very great pains, brought thither such materials as were proper for\r\nthat purpose, being pieces of timber very well worth seeing, both for\r\ntheir straightness and their largeness; but the war coming on, and\r\ninterrupting the work, John had them cut, and prepared for the building\r\nhim towers, he finding them long enough to oppose from them those his\r\nadversaries that thought him from the temple that was above him. He also\r\nhad them brought and erected behind the inner court over against the\r\nwest end of the cloisters, where alone he could erect them; whereas the\r\nother sides of that court had so many steps as would not let them come\r\nnigh enough the cloisters.\r\n\r\n6. Thus did John hope to be too hard for his enemies by these engines\r\nconstructed by his impiety; but God himself demonstrated that his pains\r\nwould prove of no use to him, by bringing the Romans upon him, before\r\nhe had reared any of his towers; for Titus, when he had gotten together\r\npart of his forces about him, and had ordered the rest to meet him at\r\nJerusalem, marched out of Cesarea. He had with him those three legions\r\nthat had accompanied his father when he laid Judea waste, together with\r\nthat twelfth legion which had been formerly beaten with Cestius; which\r\nlegion, as it was otherwise remarkable for its valor, so did it march\r\non now with greater alacrity to avenge themselves on the Jews, as\r\nremembering what they had formerly suffered from them. Of these legions\r\nhe ordered the fifth to meet him, by going through Emmaus, and the tenth\r\nto go up by Jericho; he also moved himself, together with the rest;\r\nbesides whom, marched those auxiliaries that came from the kings, being\r\nnow more in number than before, together with a considerable number that\r\ncame to his assistance from Syria. Those also that had been selected out\r\nof these four legions, and sent with Mucianus to Italy, had their places\r\nfilled up out of these soldiers that came out of Egypt with Titus; who\r\nwere two thousand men, chosen out of the armies at Alexandria. There\r\nfollowed him also three thousand drawn from those that guarded the river\r\nEuphrates; as also there came Tiberius Alexander, who was a friend of\r\nhis, most valuable, both for his good-will to him, and for his prudence.\r\nHe had formerly been governor of Alexandria, but was now thought worthy\r\nto be general of the army [under Titus]. The reason of this was, that he\r\nhad been the first who encouraged Vespasian very lately to accept this\r\nhis new dominion, and joined himself to him with great fidelity, when\r\nthings were uncertain, and fortune had not yet declared for him. He also\r\nfollowed Titus as a counselor, very useful to him in this war, both by\r\nhis age and skill in such affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Titus Marched To Jerusalem, And How He Was In Danger As\r\n     He Was Taking A View Of The City Of The Place Also Where He\r\n     Pitched His Camp\r\n\r\n1. Now, as Titus was upon his march into the enemy's country, the\r\nauxiliaries that were sent by the kings marched first, having all the\r\nother auxiliaries with them; after whom followed those that were to\r\nprepare the roads and measure out the camp; then came the commander's\r\nbaggage, and after that the other soldiers, who were completely armed\r\nto support them; then came Titus himself, having with him another select\r\nbody; and then came the pikemen; after whom came the horse belonging to\r\nthat legion. All these came before the engines; and after these engines\r\ncame the tribunes and the leaders of the cohorts, with their select\r\nbodies; after these came the ensigns, with the eagle; and before those\r\nensigns came the trumpeters belonging to them; next these came the main\r\nbody of the army in their ranks, every rank being six deep; the servants\r\nbelonging to every legion came after these; and before these last their\r\nbaggage; the mercenaries came last, and those that guarded them brought\r\nup the rear. Now Titus, according to the Roman usage, went in the\r\nfront of the army after a decent manner, and marched through Samaria to\r\nGophna, a city that had been formerly taken by his father, and was then\r\ngarrisoned by Roman soldiers; and when he had lodged there one night, he\r\nmarched on in the morning; and when he had gone as far as a day's march,\r\nhe pitched his camp at that valley which the Jews, in their own tongue,\r\ncall \"the Valley of Thorns,\" near a certain village called Gabaothsath,\r\nwhich signifies \"the Hill of Saul,\" being distant from Jerusalem about\r\nthirty furlongs. 6 There it was that he chose out six hundred select\r\nhorsemen, and went to take a view of the city, to observe what strength\r\nit was of, and how courageous the Jews were; whether, when they saw him,\r\nand before they came to a direct battle, they would be affrighted and\r\nsubmit; for he had been informed what was really true, that the people\r\nwho were fallen under the power of the seditious and the robbers were\r\ngreatly desirous of peace; but being too weak to rise up against the\r\nrest, they lay still.\r\n\r\n2. Now, so long as he rode along the straight road which led to the wall\r\nof the city, nobody appeared out of the gates; but when he went out of\r\nthat road, and declined towards the tower Psephinus, and led the band of\r\nhorsemen obliquely, an immense number of the Jews leaped out suddenly at\r\nthe towers called the \"Women's Towers,\" through that gate which was over\r\nagainst the monuments of queen Helena, and intercepted his horse; and\r\nstanding directly opposite to those that still ran along the road,\r\nhindered them from joining those that had declined out of it. They\r\nintercepted Titus also, with a few other. Now it was here impossible for\r\nhim to go forward, because all the places had trenches dug in them from\r\nthe wall, to preserve the gardens round about, and were full of gardens\r\nobliquely situated, and of many hedges; and to return back to his own\r\nmen, he saw it was also impossible, by reason of the multitude of the\r\nenemies that lay between them; many of whom did not so much as know that\r\nthe king was in any danger, but supposed him still among them. So he\r\nperceived that his preservation must be wholly owing to his own courage,\r\nand turned his horse about, and cried out aloud to those that were about\r\nhim to follow him, and ran with violence into the midst of his enemies,\r\nin order to force his way through them to his own men. And hence we may\r\nprincipally learn, that both the success of wars, and the dangers that\r\nkings 7 are in, are under the providence of God; for while such a number\r\nof darts were thrown at Titus, when he had neither his head-piece on,\r\nnor his breastplate, [for, as I told you, he went out not to fight, but\r\nto view the city,] none of them touched his body, but went aside without\r\nhurting him; as if all of them missed him on purpose, and only made a\r\nnoise as they passed by him. So he diverted those perpetually with his\r\nsword that came on his side, and overturned many of those that directly\r\nmet him, and made his horse ride over those that were overthrown. The\r\nenemy indeed made a shout at the boldness of Caesar, and exhorted one\r\nanother to rush upon him. Yet did these against whom he marched fly\r\naway, and go off from him in great numbers; while those that were in the\r\nsame danger with him kept up close to him, though they were wounded both\r\non their backs and on their sides; for they had each of them but this\r\none hope of escaping, if they could assist Titus in opening himself a\r\nway, that he might not be encompassed round by his enemies before he got\r\naway from them. Now there were two of those that were with him, but at\r\nsome distance; the one of which the enemy compassed round, and slew\r\nhim with their darts, and his horse also; but the other they slew as\r\nhe leaped down from his horse, and carried off his horse with them. But\r\nTitus escaped with the rest, and came safe to the camp. So this\r\nsuccess of the Jews' first attack raised their minds, and gave them an\r\nill-grounded hope; and this short inclination of fortune, on their side,\r\nmade them very courageous for the future.\r\n\r\n3. But now, as soon as that legion that had been at Emmaus was joined to\r\nCaesar at night, he removed thence, when it was day, and came to a place\r\ncalled Seopus; from whence the city began already to be seen, and a\r\nplain view might be taken of the great temple. Accordingly, this place,\r\non the north quarter of the city, and joining thereto, was a plain, and\r\nvery properly named Scopus, [the prospect,] and was no more than seven\r\nfurlongs distant from it. And here it was that Titus ordered a camp\r\nto be fortified for two legions that were to be together; but ordered\r\nanother camp to be fortified, at three furlongs farther distance behind\r\nthem, for the fifth legion; for he thought that, by marching in the\r\nnight, they might be tired, and might deserve to be covered from the\r\nenemy, and with less fear might fortify themselves; and as these were\r\nnow beginning to build, the tenth legion, who came through Jericho,\r\nwas already come to the place, where a certain party of armed men had\r\nformerly lain, to guard that pass into the city, and had been taken\r\nbefore by Vespasian. These legions had orders to encamp at the distance\r\nof six furlongs from Jerusalem, at the mount called the Mount of Olives\r\n8 which lies over against the city on the east side, and is parted from\r\nit by a deep valley, interposed between them, which is named Cedron.\r\n\r\n4. Now when hitherto the several parties in the city had been dashing\r\none against another perpetually, this foreign war, now suddenly\r\ncome upon them after a violent manner, put the first stop to their\r\ncontentions one against another; and as the seditious now saw with\r\nastonishment the Romans pitching three several camps, they began to\r\nthink of an awkward sort of concord, and said one to another, \"What do\r\nwe here, and what do we mean, when we suffer three fortified walls to be\r\nbuilt to coop us in, that we shall not be able to breathe freely? while\r\nthe enemy is securely building a kind of city in opposition to us, and\r\nwhile we sit still within our own walls, and become spectators only of\r\nwhat they are doing, with our hands idle, and our armor laid by, as if\r\nthey were about somewhat that was for our good and advantage. We are, it\r\nseems, [so did they cry out,] only courageous against ourselves,\r\nwhile the Romans are likely to gain the city without bloodshed by our\r\nsedition.\" Thus did they encourage one another when they were gotten\r\ntogether, and took their armor immediately, and ran out upon the tenth\r\nlegion, and fell upon the Romans with great eagerness, and with a\r\nprodigious shout, as they were fortifying their camp. These Romans were\r\ncaught in different parties, and this in order to perform their several\r\nworks, and on that account had in great measure laid aside their arms;\r\nfor they thought the Jews would not have ventured to make a sally upon\r\nthem; and had they been disposed so to do, they supposed their sedition\r\nwould have distracted them. So they were put into disorder unexpectedly;\r\nwhen some of them left their works they were about, and immediately\r\nmarched off, while many ran to their arms, but were smitten and slain\r\nbefore they could turn back upon the enemy. The Jews became still more\r\nand more in number, as encouraged by the good success of those that\r\nfirst made the attack; and while they had such good fortune, they seemed\r\nboth to themselves and to the enemy to be many more than they really\r\nwere. The disorderly way of their fighting at first put the Romans also\r\nto a stand, who had been constantly used to fight skillfully in good\r\norder, and with keeping their ranks, and obeying the orders that were\r\ngiven them; for which reason the Romans were caught unexpectedly, and\r\nwere obliged to give way to the assaults that were made upon them. Now\r\nwhen these Romans were overtaken, and turned back upon the Jews, they\r\nput a stop to their career; yet when they did not take care enough of\r\nthemselves through the vehemency of their pursuit, they were wounded\r\nby them; but as still more and more Jews sallied out of the city, the\r\nRomans were at length brought into confusion, and put to flight, and\r\nran away from their camp. Nay, things looked as though the entire legion\r\nwould have been in danger, unless Titus had been informed of the case\r\nthey were in, and had sent them succors immediately. So he reproached\r\nthem for their cowardice, and brought those back that were running away,\r\nand fell himself upon the Jews on their flank, with those select troops\r\nthat were with him, and slew a considerable number, and wounded more of\r\nthem, and put them all to flight, and made them run away hastily down\r\nthe valley. Now as these Jews suffered greatly in the declivity of the\r\nvalley, so when they were gotten over it, they turned about, and stood\r\nover against the Romans, having the valley between them, and there\r\nfought with them. Thus did they continue the fight till noon; but when\r\nit was already a little after noon, Titus set those that came to the\r\nassistance of the Romans with him, and those that belonged to the\r\ncohorts, to prevent the Jews from making any more sallies, and then sent\r\nthe rest of the legion to the upper part of the mountain, to fortify\r\ntheir camp.\r\n\r\n5. This march of the Romans seemed to the Jews to be a flight; and as\r\nthe watchman who was placed upon the wall gave a signal by shaking his\r\ngarment, there came out a fresh multitude of Jews, and that with such\r\nmighty violence, that one might compare it to the running of the most\r\nterrible wild beasts. To say the truth, none of those that opposed them\r\ncould sustain the fury with which they made their attacks; but, as if\r\nthey had been cast out of an engine, they brake the enemies' ranks to\r\npieces, who were put to flight, and ran away to the mountain; none but\r\nTitus himself, and a few others with him, being left in the midst of the\r\nacclivity. Now these others, who were his friends, despised the danger\r\nthey were in, and were ashamed to leave their general, earnestly\r\nexhorting him to give way to these Jews that are fond of dying, and not\r\nto run into such dangers before those that ought to stay before him;\r\nto consider what his fortune was, and not, by supplying the place of a\r\ncommon soldier, to venture to turn back upon the enemy so suddenly; and\r\nthis because he was general in the war, and lord of the habitable\r\nearth, on whose preservation the public affairs do all depend. These\r\npersuasions Titus seemed not so much as to hear, but opposed those that\r\nran upon him, and smote them on the face; and when he had forced them to\r\ngo back, he slew them: he also fell upon great numbers as they marched\r\ndown the hill, and thrust them forward; while those men were so amazed\r\nat his courage and his strength, that they could not fly directly to the\r\ncity, but declined from him on both sides, and pressed after those that\r\nfled up the hill; yet did he still fall upon their flank, and put a stop\r\nto their fury. In the mean time, a disorder and a terror fell again upon\r\nthose that were fortifying their camp at the top of the hill, upon their\r\nseeing those beneath them running away; insomuch that the whole legion\r\nwas dispersed, while they thought that the sallies of the Jews upon them\r\nwere plainly insupportable, and that Titus was himself put to flight;\r\nbecause they took it for granted, that, if he had staid, the rest would\r\nnever have fled for it. Thus were they encompassed on every side by\r\na kind of panic fear, and some dispersed themselves one way, and some\r\nanother, till certain of them saw their general in the very midst of an\r\naction, and being under great concern for him, they loudly proclaimed\r\nthe danger he was in to the entire legion; and now shame made them turn\r\nback, and they reproached one another that they did worse than run away,\r\nby deserting Caesar. So they used their utmost force against the Jews,\r\nand declining from the straight declivity, they drove them on heaps into\r\nthe bottom of the valley. Then did the Jews turn about and fight them;\r\nbut as they were themselves retiring, and now, because the Romans had\r\nthe advantage of the ground, and were above the Jews, they drove them\r\nall into the valley. Titus also pressed upon those that were near him,\r\nand sent the legion again to fortify their camp; while he, and those\r\nthat were with him before, opposed the enemy, and kept them from doing\r\nfurther mischief; insomuch that, if I may be allowed neither to add any\r\nthing out of flattery, nor to diminish any thing out of envy, but to\r\nspeak the plain truth, Caesar did twice deliver that entire legion when\r\nit was in jeopardy, and gave them a quiet opportunity of fortifying\r\ntheir camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The Sedition Was Again Revived Within Jerusalem And Yet\r\n     The Jews Contrived Snares For The Romans. How Titus Also\r\n     Threatened His Soldiers For Their Ungovernable Rashness.\r\n\r\n1. As now the war abroad ceased for a while, the sedition within was\r\nrevived; and on the feast of unleavened bread, which was now come, it\r\nbeing the fourteenth day of the month Xanthicus, [Nisan,] when it is\r\nbelieved the Jews were first freed from the Egyptians, Eleazar and\r\nhis party opened the gates of this [inmost court of the] temple, and\r\nadmitted such of the people as were desirous to worship God into it.\r\n9 But John made use of this festival as a cloak for his treacherous\r\ndesigns, and armed the most inconsiderable of his own party, the greater\r\npart of whom were not purified, with weapons concealed under their\r\ngarments, and sent them with great zeal into the temple, in order to\r\nseize upon it; which armed men, when they were gotten in, threw their\r\ngarments away, and presently appeared in their armor. Upon which there\r\nwas a very great disorder and disturbance about the holy house; while\r\nthe people, who had no concern in the sedition, supposed that this\r\nassault was made against all without distinction, as the zealots thought\r\nit was made against themselves only. So these left off guarding the\r\ngates any longer, and leaped down from their battlements before they\r\ncame to an engagement, and fled away into the subterranean caverns of\r\nthe temple; while the people that stood trembling at the altar, and\r\nabout the holy house, were rolled on heaps together, and trampled upon,\r\nand were beaten both with wooden and with iron weapons without mercy.\r\nSuch also as had differences with others slew many persons that were\r\nquiet, out of their own private enmity and hatred, as if they were\r\nopposite to the seditious; and all those that had formerly offended\r\nany of these plotters were now known, and were now led away to the\r\nslaughter; and when they had done abundance of horrid mischief to the\r\nguiltless, they granted a truce to the guilty, and let those go off that\r\ncame out of the caverns. These followers of John also did now seize upon\r\nthis inner temple, and upon all the warlike engines therein, and then\r\nventured to oppose Simon. And thus that sedition, which had been divided\r\ninto three factions, was now reduced to two.\r\n\r\n2. But Titus, intending to pitch his camp nearer to the city than\r\nScopus, placed as many of his choice horsemen and footmen as he thought\r\nsufficient opposite to the Jews, to prevent their sallying out upon\r\nthem, while he gave orders for the whole army to level the distance, as\r\nfar as the wall of the city. So they threw down all the hedges and walls\r\nwhich the inhabitants had made about their gardens and groves of trees,\r\nand cut down all the fruit trees that lay between them and the wall\r\nof the city, and filled up all the hollow places and the chasms, and\r\ndemolished the rocky precipices with iron instruments; and thereby made\r\nall the place level from Scopus to Herod's monuments, which adjoined to\r\nthe pool called the Serpent's Pool.\r\n\r\n3. Now at this very time the Jews contrived the following stratagem\r\nagainst the Romans. The bolder sort of the seditious went out at the\r\ntowers, called the Women's Towers, as if they had been ejected out of\r\nthe city by those who were for peace, and rambled about as if they\r\nwere afraid of being assaulted by the Romans, and were in fear of one\r\nanother; while those that stood upon the wall, and seemed to be of the\r\npeople's side, cried out aloud for peace, and entreated they might\r\nhave security for their lives given them, and called for the Romans,\r\npromising to open the gates to them; and as they cried out after that\r\nmanner, they threw stones at their own people, as though they would\r\ndrive them away from the gates. These also pretended that they were\r\nexcluded by force, and that they petitioned those that were within to\r\nlet them in; and rushing upon the Romans perpetually, with violence,\r\nthey then came back, and seemed to be in great disorder. Now the Roman\r\nsoldiers thought this cunning stratagem of theirs was to be believed\r\nreal, and thinking they had the one party under their power, and could\r\npunish them as they pleased, and hoping that the other party would open\r\ntheir gates to them, set to the execution of their designs accordingly.\r\nBut for Titus himself, he had this surprising conduct of the Jews\r\nin suspicion; for whereas he had invited them to come to terms of\r\naccommodation, by Josephus, but one day before, he could then receive\r\nno civil answer from them; so he ordered the soldiers to stay where\r\nthey were. However, some of them that were set in the front of the works\r\nprevented him, and catching up their arms ran to the gates; whereupon\r\nthose that seemed to have been ejected at the first retired; but as soon\r\nas the soldiers were gotten between the towers on each side of the gate,\r\nthe Jews ran out and encompassed them round, and fell upon them behind,\r\nwhile that multitude which stood upon the wall threw a heap of stones\r\nand darts of all kinds at them, insomuch that they slew a considerable\r\nnumber, and wounded many more; for it was not easy for the Romans to\r\nescape, by reason those behind them pressed them forward; besides which,\r\nthe shame they were under for being mistaken, and the fear they were\r\nin of their commanders, engaged them to persevere in their mistake;\r\nwherefore they fought with their spears a great while, and received many\r\nblows from the Jews, though indeed they gave them as many blows again,\r\nand at last repelled those that had encompassed them about, while the\r\nJews pursued them as they retired, and followed them, and threw darts at\r\nthem as far as the monuments of queen Helena.\r\n\r\n4. After this these Jews, without keeping any decorum, grew insolent\r\nupon their good fortune, and jested upon the Romans for being deluded by\r\nthe trick they had put upon them, and making a noise with beating their\r\nshields, leaped for gladness, and made joyful exclamations; while these\r\nsoldiers were received with threatenings by their officers, and with\r\nindignation by Caesar himself, [who spake to them thus]: These Jews,\r\nwho are only conducted by their madness, do every thing with care and\r\ncircumspection; they contrive stratagems, and lay ambushes, and fortune\r\ngives success to their stratagems, because they are obedient, and\r\npreserve their goodwill and fidelity to one another; while the Romans,\r\nto whom fortune uses to be ever subservient, by reason of their good\r\norder, and ready submission to their commanders, have now had ill\r\nsuccess by their contrary behavior, and by not being able to restrain\r\ntheir hands from action, they have been caught; and that which is the\r\nmost to their reproach, they have gone on without their commanders,\r\nin the very presence of Caesar. \"Truly,\" says Titus, \"the laws of war\r\ncannot but groan heavily, as will my father also himself, when he shall\r\nbe informed of this wound that hath been given us, since he who is grown\r\nold in wars did never make so great a mistake. Our laws of war do also\r\never inflict capital punishment on those that in the least break into\r\ngood order, while at this time they have seen an entire army run into\r\ndisorder. However, those that have been so insolent shall be made\r\nimmediately sensible, that even they who conquer among the Romans\r\nwithout orders for fighting are to be under disgrace.\" When Titus had\r\nenlarged upon this matter before the commanders, it appeared evident\r\nthat he would execute the law against all those that were concerned; so\r\nthese soldiers' minds sunk down in despair, as expecting to be put to\r\ndeath, and that justly and quickly. However, the other legions came\r\nround about Titus, and entreated his favor to these their fellow\r\nsoldiers, and made supplication to him, that he would pardon the\r\nrashness of a few, on account of the better obedience of all the rest;\r\nand promised for them that they should make amends for their present\r\nfault, by their more virtuous behavior for the time to come.\r\n\r\n5. So Caesar complied with their desires, and with what prudence\r\ndictated to him also; for he esteemed it fit to punish single persons\r\nby real executions, but that the punishment of great multitudes should\r\nproceed no further than reproofs; so he was reconciled to the soldiers,\r\nbut gave them a special charge to act more wisely for the future; and\r\nhe considered with himself how he might be even with the Jews for their\r\nstratagem. And now when the space between the Romans and the wall had\r\nbeen leveled, which was done in four days, and as he was desirous to\r\nbring the baggage of the army, with the rest of the multitude that\r\nfollowed him, safely to the camp, he set the strongest part of his army\r\nover against that wall which lay on the north quarter of the city, and\r\nover against the western part of it, and made his army seven deep, with\r\nthe foot-men placed before them, and the horsemen behind them, each of\r\nthe last in three ranks, whilst the archers stood in the midst in seven\r\nranks. And now as the Jews were prohibited, by so great a body of men,\r\nfrom making sallies upon the Romans, both the beasts that bare the\r\nburdens, and belonged to the three legions, and the rest of the\r\nmultitude, marched on without any fear. But as for Titus himself, he was\r\nbut about two furlongs distant from the wall, at that part of it\r\nwhere was the corner 10 and over against that tower which was called\r\nPsephinus, at which tower the compass of the wall belonging to the north\r\nbended, and extended itself over against the west; but the other part of\r\nthe army fortified itself at the tower called Hippicus, and was distant,\r\nin like manner, by two furlongs from the city. However, the tenth legion\r\ncontinued in its own place, upon the Mount of Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Description Of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1. The city of Jerusalem was fortified with three walls, on such parts\r\nas were not encompassed with unpassable valleys; for in such places it\r\nhad but one wall. The city was built upon two hills, which are opposite\r\nto one another, and have a valley to divide them asunder; at which\r\nvalley the corresponding rows of houses on both hills end. Of these\r\nhills, that which contains the upper city is much higher, and in length\r\nmore direct. Accordingly, it was called the \"Citadel,\" by king David; he\r\nwas the father of that Solomon who built this temple at the first; but\r\nit is by us called the \"Upper Market-place.\" But the other hill, which\r\nwas called \"Acra,\" and sustains the lower city, is of the shape of a\r\nmoon when she is horned; over against this there was a third hill, but\r\nnaturally lower than Acra, and parted formerly from the other by a broad\r\nvalley. However, in those times when the Asamoneans reigned, they\r\nfilled up that valley with earth, and had a mind to join the city to the\r\ntemple. They then took off part of the height of Acra, and reduced it\r\nto be of less elevation than it was before, that the temple might be\r\nsuperior to it. Now the Valley of the Cheesemongers, as it was called,\r\nand was that which we told you before distinguished the hill of the\r\nupper city from that of the lower, extended as far as Siloam; for that\r\nis the name of a fountain which hath sweet water in it, and this in\r\ngreat plenty also. But on the outsides, these hills are surrounded by\r\ndeep valleys, and by reason of the precipices to them belonging on both\r\nsides they are every where unpassable.\r\n\r\n2. Now, of these three walls, the old one was hard to be taken, both by\r\nreason of the valleys, and of that hill on which it was built, and which\r\nwas above them. But besides that great advantage, as to the place where\r\nthey were situated, it was also built very strong; because David and\r\nSolomon, and the following kings, were very zealous about this work.\r\nNow that wall began on the north, at the tower called \"Hippicus,\" and\r\nextended as far as the \"Xistus,\" a place so called, and then, joining to\r\nthe council-house, ended at the west cloister of the temple. But if\r\nwe go the other way westward, it began at the same place, and extended\r\nthrough a place called \"Bethso,\" to the gate of the Essens; and after\r\nthat it went southward, having its bending above the fountain Siloam,\r\nwhere it also bends again towards the east at Solomon's pool, and\r\nreaches as far as a certain place which they called \"Ophlas,\" where it\r\nwas joined to the eastern cloister of the temple. The second wall took\r\nits beginning from that gate which they called \"Gennath,\" which belonged\r\nto the first wall; it only encompassed the northern quarter of the city,\r\nand reached as far as the tower Antonia. The beginning of the third wall\r\nwas at the tower Hippicus, whence it reached as far as the north quarter\r\nof the city, and the tower Psephinus, and then was so far extended till\r\nit came over against the monuments of Helena, which Helena was queen of\r\nAdiabene, the daughter of Izates; it then extended further to a great\r\nlength, and passed by the sepulchral caverns of the kings, and bent\r\nagain at the tower of the corner, at the monument which is called the\r\n\"Monument of the Fuller,\" and joined to the old wall at the valley\r\ncalled the \"Valley of Cedron.\" It was Agrippa who encompassed the parts\r\nadded to the old city with this wall, which had been all naked before;\r\nfor as the city grew more populous, it gradually crept beyond its old\r\nlimits, and those parts of it that stood northward of the temple,\r\nand joined that hill to the city, made it considerably larger, and\r\noccasioned that hill, which is in number the fourth, and is called\r\n\"Bezetha,\" to be inhabited also. It lies over against the tower Antonia,\r\nbut is divided from it by a deep valley, which was dug on purpose, and\r\nthat in order to hinder the foundations of the tower of Antonia from\r\njoining to this hill, and thereby affording an opportunity for getting\r\nto it with ease, and hindering the security that arose from its superior\r\nelevation; for which reason also that depth of the ditch made the\r\nelevation of the towers more remarkable. This new-built part of the\r\ncity was called \"Bezetha,\" in our language, which, if interpreted in the\r\nGrecian language, may be called \"the New City.\" Since, therefore, its\r\ninhabitants stood in need of a covering, the father of the present king,\r\nand of the same name with him, Agrippa, began that wall we spoke of; but\r\nhe left off building it when he had only laid the foundations, out of\r\nthe fear he was in of Claudius Caesar, lest he should suspect that\r\nso strong a wall was built in order to make some innovation in public\r\naffairs; for the city could no way have been taken if that wall had\r\nbeen finished in the manner it was begun; as its parts were connected\r\ntogether by stones twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad, which could\r\nnever have been either easily undermined by any iron tools, or shaken\r\nby any engines. The wall was, however, ten cubits wide, and it would\r\nprobably have had a height greater than that, had not his zeal who began\r\nit been hindered from exerting itself. After this, it was erected with\r\ngreat diligence by the Jews, as high as twenty cubits, above which it\r\nhad battlements of two cubits, and turrets of three cubits altitude,\r\ninsomuch that the entire altitude extended as far as twenty-five cubits.\r\n\r\n3. Now the towers that were upon it were twenty cubits in breadth, and\r\ntwenty cubits in height; they were square and solid, as was the wall\r\nitself, wherein the niceness of the joints, and the beauty of the\r\nstones, were no way inferior to those of the holy house itself. Above\r\nthis solid altitude of the towers, which was twenty cubits, there were\r\nrooms of great magnificence, and over them upper rooms, and cisterns to\r\nreceive rain-water. They were many in number, and the steps by which you\r\nascended up to them were every one broad: of these towers then the\r\nthird wall had ninety, and the spaces between them were each two hundred\r\ncubits; but in the middle wall were forty towers, and the old wall was\r\nparted into sixty, while the whole compass of the city was thirty-three\r\nfurlongs. Now the third wall was all of it wonderful; yet was the tower\r\nPsephinus elevated above it at the north-west corner, and there Titus\r\npitched his own tent; for being seventy cubits high it both afforded a\r\nprospect of Arabia at sun-rising, as well as it did of the utmost limits\r\nof the Hebrew possessions at the sea westward. Moreover, it was an\r\noctagon, and over against it was the tower Hipplicus, and hard by two\r\nothers were erected by king Herod, in the old wall. These were for\r\nlargeness, beauty, and strength beyond all that were in the habitable\r\nearth; for besides the magnanimity of his nature, and his magnificence\r\ntowards the city on other occasions, he built these after such an\r\nextraordinary manner, to gratify his own private affections, and\r\ndedicated these towers to the memory of those three persons who had been\r\nthe dearest to him, and from whom he named them. They were his brother,\r\nhis friend, and his wife. This wife he had slain, out of his love [and\r\njealousy], as we have already related; the other two he lost in war, as\r\nthey were courageously fighting. Hippicus, so named from his friend,\r\nwas square; its length and breadth were each twenty-five cubits, and its\r\nheight thirty, and it had no vacuity in it. Over this solid building,\r\nwhich was composed of great stones united together, there was a\r\nreservoir twenty cubits deep, over which there was a house of two\r\nstories, whose height was twenty-five cubits, and divided into several\r\nparts; over which were battlements of two cubits, and turrets all round\r\nof three cubits high, insomuch that the entire height added together\r\namounted to fourscore cubits. The second tower, which he named from his\r\nbrother Phasaelus, had its breadth and its height equal, each of them\r\nforty cubits; over which was its solid height of forty cubits; over\r\nwhich a cloister went round about, whose height was ten cubits, and it\r\nwas covered from enemies by breast-works and bulwarks. There was also\r\nbuilt over that cloister another tower, parted into magnificent rooms,\r\nand a place for bathing; so that this tower wanted nothing that\r\nmight make it appear to be a royal palace. It was also adorned with\r\nbattlements and turrets, more than was the foregoing, and the entire\r\naltitude was about ninety cubits; the appearance of it resembled the\r\ntower of Pharus, which exhibited a fire to such as sailed to Alexandria,\r\nbut was much larger than it in compass. This was now converted to a\r\nhouse, wherein Simon exercised his tyrannical authority. The third tower\r\nwas Mariamne, for that was his queen's name; it was solid as high as\r\ntwenty cubits; its breadth and its length were twenty cubits, and were\r\nequal to each other; its upper buildings were more magnificent, and had\r\ngreater variety, than the other towers had; for the king thought it most\r\nproper for him to adorn that which was denominated from his wife, better\r\nthan those denominated from men, as those were built stronger than this\r\nthat bore his wife's name. The entire height of this tower was fifty\r\ncubits.\r\n\r\n4. Now as these towers were so very tall, they appeared much taller by\r\nthe place on which they stood; for that very old wall wherein they were\r\nwas built on a high hill, and was itself a kind of elevation that was\r\nstill thirty cubits taller; over which were the towers situated, and\r\nthereby were made much higher to appearance. The largeness also of the\r\nstones was wonderful; for they were not made of common small stones,\r\nnor of such large ones only as men could carry, but they were of white\r\nmarble, cut out of the rock; each stone was twenty cubits in length, and\r\nten in breadth, and five in depth. They were so exactly united to\r\none another, that each tower looked like one entire rock of stone, so\r\ngrowing naturally, and afterward cut by the hand of the artificers into\r\ntheir present shape and corners; so little, or not at all, did their\r\njoints or connexion appear low as these towers were themselves on the\r\nnorth side of the wall, the king had a palace inwardly thereto adjoined,\r\nwhich exceeds all my ability to describe it; for it was so very curious\r\nas to want no cost nor skill in its construction, but was entirely\r\nwalled about to the height of thirty cubits, and was adorned with towers\r\nat equal distances, and with large bed-chambers, that would contain beds\r\nfor a hundred guests a-piece, in which the variety of the stones is not\r\nto be expressed; for a large quantity of those that were rare of that\r\nkind was collected together. Their roofs were also wonderful, both for\r\nthe length of the beams, and the splendor of their ornaments. The number\r\nof the rooms was also very great, and the variety of the figures that\r\nwere about them was prodigious; their furniture was complete, and the\r\ngreatest part of the vessels that were put in them was of silver and\r\ngold. There were besides many porticoes, one beyond another, round\r\nabout, and in each of those porticoes curious pillars; yet were all\r\nthe courts that were exposed to the air every where green. There were,\r\nmoreover, several groves of trees, and long walks through them, with\r\ndeep canals, and cisterns, that in several parts were filled with\r\nbrazen statues, through which the water ran out. There were withal many\r\ndove-courts 11 of tame pigeons about the canals. But indeed it is not\r\npossible to give a complete description of these palaces; and the very\r\nremembrance of them is a torment to one, as putting one in mind what\r\nvastly rich buildings that fire which was kindled by the robbers hath\r\nconsumed; for these were not burnt by the Romans, but by these internal\r\nplotters, as we have already related, in the beginning of their\r\nrebellion. That fire began at the tower of Antonia, and went on to the\r\npalaces, and consumed the upper parts of the three towers themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A Description Of The Temple.\r\n\r\n1. Now this temple, as I have already said, was built upon a strong\r\nhill. At first the plain at the top was hardly sufficient for the holy\r\nhouse and the altar, for the ground about it was very uneven, and like\r\na precipice; but when king Solomon, who was the person that built the\r\ntemple, had built a wall to it on its east side, there was then added\r\none cloister founded on a bank cast up for it, and on the other parts\r\nthe holy house stood naked. But in future ages the people added new\r\nbanks, 12 and the hill became a larger plain. They then broke down the\r\nwall on the north side, and took in as much as sufficed afterward for\r\nthe compass of the entire temple. And when they had built walls on three\r\nsides of the temple round about, from the bottom of the hill, and had\r\nperformed a work that was greater than could be hoped for, [in which\r\nwork long ages were spent by them, as well as all their sacred treasures\r\nwere exhausted, which were still replenished by those tributes which\r\nwere sent to God from the whole habitable earth,] they then encompassed\r\ntheir upper courts with cloisters, as well as they [afterward] did the\r\nlowest [court of the] temple. The lowest part of this was erected to the\r\nheight of three hundred cubits, and in some places more; yet did not\r\nthe entire depth of the foundations appear, for they brought earth, and\r\nfilled up the valleys, as being desirous to make them on a level with\r\nthe narrow streets of the city; wherein they made use of stones of forty\r\ncubits in magnitude; for the great plenty of money they then had, and\r\nthe liberality of the people, made this attempt of theirs to succeed to\r\nan incredible degree; and what could not be so much as hoped for as ever\r\nto be accomplished, was, by perseverance and length of time, brought to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n2. Now for the works that were above these foundations, these were not\r\nunworthy of such foundations; for all the cloisters were double, and\r\nthe pillars to them belonging were twenty-five cubits in height, and\r\nsupported the cloisters. These pillars were of one entire stone each of\r\nthem, and that stone was white marble; and the roofs were adorned with\r\ncedar, curiously graven. The natural magnificence, and excellent polish,\r\nand the harmony of the joints in these cloisters, afforded a prospect\r\nthat was very remarkable; nor was it on the outside adorned with any\r\nwork of the painter or engraver. The cloisters [of the outmost court]\r\nwere in breadth thirty cubits, while the entire compass of it was by\r\nmeasure six furlongs, including the tower of Antonia; those entire\r\ncourts that were exposed to the air were laid with stones of all sorts.\r\nWhen you go through these [first] cloisters, unto the second [court of\r\nthe] temple, there was a partition made of stone all round, whose height\r\nwas three cubits: its construction was very elegant; upon it stood\r\npillars, at equal distances from one another, declaring the law of\r\npurity, some in Greek, and some in Roman letters, that \"no foreigner\r\nshould go within that sanctuary\" for that second [court of the] temple\r\nwas called \"the Sanctuary,\" and was ascended to by fourteen steps from\r\nthe first court. This court was four-square, and had a wall about it\r\npeculiar to itself; the height of its buildings, although it were on the\r\noutside forty cubits, 13 was hidden by the steps, and on the inside that\r\nheight was but twenty-five cubits; for it being built over against a\r\nhigher part of the hill with steps, it was no further to be entirely\r\ndiscerned within, being covered by the hill itself. Beyond these\r\nthirteen steps there was the distance of ten cubits; this was all plain;\r\nwhence there were other steps, each of five cubits a-piece, that led to\r\nthe gates, which gates on the north and south sides were eight, on each\r\nof those sides four, and of necessity two on the east. For since there\r\nwas a partition built for the women on that side, as the proper place\r\nwherein they were to worship, there was a necessity for a second gate\r\nfor them: this gate was cut out of its wall, over against the first\r\ngate. There was also on the other sides one southern and one northern\r\ngate, through which was a passage into the court of the women; for as\r\nto the other gates, the women were not allowed to pass through them;\r\nnor when they went through their own gate could they go beyond their own\r\nwall. This place was allotted to the women of our own country, and\r\nof other countries, provided they were of the same nation, and that\r\nequally. The western part of this court had no gate at all, but the wall\r\nwas built entire on that side. But then the cloisters which were betwixt\r\nthe gates extended from the wall inward, before the chambers; for they\r\nwere supported by very fine and large pillars. These cloisters were\r\nsingle, and, excepting their magnitude, were no way inferior to those of\r\nthe lower court.\r\n\r\n3. Now nine of these gates were on every side covered over with gold and\r\nsilver, as were the jambs of their doors and their lintels; but there\r\nwas one gate that was without the [inward court of the] holy house,\r\nwhich was of Corinthian brass, and greatly excelled those that were only\r\ncovered over with silver and gold. Each gate had two doors, whose height\r\nwas severally thirty cubits, and their breadth fifteen. However, they\r\nhad large spaces within of thirty cubits, and had on each side rooms,\r\nand those, both in breadth and in length, built like towers, and their\r\nheight was above forty cubits. Two pillars did also support these rooms,\r\nand were in circumference twelve cubits. Now the magnitudes of the other\r\ngates were equal one to another; but that over the Corinthian gate,\r\nwhich opened on the east over against the gate of the holy house itself,\r\nwas much larger; for its height was fifty cubits; and its doors were\r\nforty cubits; and it was adorned after a most costly manner, as having\r\nmuch richer and thicker plates of silver and gold upon them than the\r\nother. These nine gates had that silver and gold poured upon them by\r\nAlexander, the father of Tiberius. Now there were fifteen steps, which\r\nled away from the wall of the court of the women to this greater gate;\r\nwhereas those that led thither from the other gates were five steps\r\nshorter.\r\n\r\n4. As to the holy house itself, which was placed in the midst [of the\r\ninmost court], that most sacred part of the temple, it was ascended to\r\nby twelve steps; and in front its height and its breadth were equal, and\r\neach a hundred cubits, though it was behind forty cubits narrower; for\r\non its front it had what may be styled shoulders on each side, that\r\npassed twenty cubits further. Its first gate was seventy cubits high,\r\nand twenty-five cubits broad; but this gate had no doors; for it\r\nrepresented the universal visibility of heaven, and that it cannot be\r\nexcluded from any place. Its front was covered with gold all over, and\r\nthrough it the first part of the house, that was more inward, did all of\r\nit appear; which, as it was very large, so did all the parts about the\r\nmore inward gate appear to shine to those that saw them; but then, as\r\nthe entire house was divided into two parts within, it was only the\r\nfirst part of it that was open to our view. Its height extended all\r\nalong to ninety cubits in height, and its length was fifty cubits, and\r\nits breadth twenty. But that gate which was at this end of the first\r\npart of the house was, as we have already observed, all over covered\r\nwith gold, as was its whole wall about it; it had also golden vines\r\nabove it, from which clusters of grapes hung as tall as a man's height.\r\nBut then this house, as it was divided into two parts, the inner part\r\nwas lower than the appearance of the outer, and had golden doors of\r\nfifty-five cubits altitude, and sixteen in breadth; but before these\r\ndoors there was a veil of equal largeness with the doors. It was a\r\nBabylonian curtain, embroidered with blue, and fine linen, and scarlet,\r\nand purple, and of a contexture that was truly wonderful. Nor was this\r\nmixture of colors without its mystical interpretation, but was a kind\r\nof image of the universe; for by the scarlet there seemed to be\r\nenigmatically signified fire, by the fine flax the earth, by the blue\r\nthe air, and by the purple the sea; two of them having their colors the\r\nfoundation of this resemblance; but the fine flax and the purple have\r\ntheir own origin for that foundation, the earth producing the one, and\r\nthe sea the other. This curtain had also embroidered upon it all that\r\nwas mystical in the heavens, excepting that of the [twelve] signs,\r\nrepresenting living creatures.\r\n\r\n5. When any persons entered into the temple, its floor received them.\r\nThis part of the temple therefore was in height sixty cubits, and its\r\nlength the same; whereas its breadth was but twenty cubits: but still\r\nthat sixty cubits in length was divided again, and the first part of it\r\nwas cut off at forty cubits, and had in it three things that were very\r\nwonderful and famous among all mankind, the candlestick, the table [of\r\nshew-bread], and the altar of incense. Now the seven lamps signified the\r\nseven planets; for so many there were springing out of the candlestick.\r\nNow the twelve loaves that were upon the table signified the circle of\r\nthe zodiac and the year; but the altar of incense, by its thirteen kinds\r\nof sweet-smelling spices with which the sea replenished it, signified\r\nthat God is the possessor of all things that are both in the\r\nuninhabitable and habitable parts of the earth, and that they are all to\r\nbe dedicated to his use. But the inmost part of the temple of all was of\r\ntwenty cubits. This was also separated from the outer part by a veil. In\r\nthis there was nothing at all. It was inaccessible and inviolable, and\r\nnot to be seen by any; and was called the Holy of Holies. Now, about the\r\nsides of the lower part of the temple, there were little houses, with\r\npassages out of one into another; there were a great many of them, and\r\nthey were of three stories high; there were also entrances on each side\r\ninto them from the gate of the temple. But the superior part of the\r\ntemple had no such little houses any further, because the temple was\r\nthere narrower, and forty cubits higher, and of a smaller body than the\r\nlower parts of it. Thus we collect that the whole height, including the\r\nsixty cubits from the floor, amounted to a hundred cubits.\r\n\r\n6. Now the outward face of the temple in its front wanted nothing that\r\nwas likely to surprise either men's minds or their eyes; for it was\r\ncovered all over with plates of gold of great weight, and, at the first\r\nrising of the sun, reflected back a very fiery splendor, and made those\r\nwho forced themselves to look upon it to turn their eyes away, just as\r\nthey would have done at the sun's own rays. But this temple appeared to\r\nstrangers, when they were coming to it at a distance, like a mountain\r\ncovered with snow; for as to those parts of it that were not gilt, they\r\nwere exceeding white. On its top it had spikes with sharp points, to\r\nprevent any pollution of it by birds sitting upon it. Of its stones,\r\nsome of them were forty-five cubits in length, five in height, and six\r\nin breadth. Before this temple stood the altar, fifteen cubits high,\r\nand equal both in length and breadth; each of which dimensions was fifty\r\ncubits. The figure it was built in was a square, and it had corners like\r\nhorns; and the passage up to it was by an insensible acclivity. It was\r\nformed without any iron tool, nor did any such iron tool so much as\r\ntouch it at any time. There was also a wall of partition, about a cubit\r\nin height, made of fine stones, and so as to be grateful to the sight;\r\nthis encompassed the holy house and the altar, and kept the people that\r\nwere on the outside off from the priests. Moreover, those that had the\r\ngonorrhea and the leprosy were excluded out of the city entirely; women\r\nalso, when their courses were upon them, were shut out of the temple;\r\nnor when they were free from that impurity, were they allowed to go\r\nbeyond the limit before-mentioned; men also, that were not thoroughly\r\npure, were prohibited to come into the inner [court of the] temple; nay,\r\nthe priests themselves that were not pure were prohibited to come into\r\nit also.\r\n\r\n7. Now all those of the stock of the priests that could not minister\r\nby reason of some defect in their bodies, came within the partition,\r\ntogether with those that had no such imperfection, and had their share\r\nwith them by reason of their stock, but still made use of none except\r\ntheir own private garments; for nobody but he that officiated had on his\r\nsacred garments; but then those priests that were without any blemish\r\nupon them went up to the altar clothed in fine linen. They abstained\r\nchiefly from wine, out of this fear, lest otherwise they should\r\ntransgress some rules of their ministration. The high priest did also go\r\nup with them; not always indeed, but on the seventh days and new moons,\r\nand if any festivals belonging to our nation, which we celebrate every\r\nyear, happened. When he officiated, he had on a pair of breeches that\r\nreached beneath his privy parts to his thighs, and had on an inner\r\ngarment of linen, together with a blue garment, round, without seam,\r\nwith fringe work, and reaching to the feet. There were also golden bells\r\nthat hung upon the fringes, and pomegranates intermixed among them. The\r\nbells signified thunder, and the pomegranates lightning. But that girdle\r\nthat tied the garment to the breast was embroidered with five rows of\r\nvarious colors, of gold, and purple, and scarlet, as also of fine linen\r\nand blue, with which colors we told you before the veils of the temple\r\nwere embroidered also. The like embroidery was upon the ephod; but the\r\nquantity of gold therein was greater. Its figure was that of a stomacher\r\nfor the breast. There were upon it two golden buttons like small\r\nshields, which buttoned the ephod to the garment; in these buttons were\r\nenclosed two very large and very excellent sardonyxes, having the names\r\nof the tribes of that nation engraved upon them: on the other part there\r\nhung twelve stones, three in a row one way, and four in the other; a\r\nsardius, a topaz, and an emerald; a carbuncle, a jasper, and a sapphire;\r\nan agate, an amethyst, and a ligure; an onyx, a beryl, and a chrysolite;\r\nupon every one of which was again engraved one of the forementioned\r\nnames of the tribes. A mitre also of fine linen encompassed his head,\r\nwhich was tied by a blue ribbon, about which there was another golden\r\ncrown, in which was engraven the sacred name [of God]: it consists of\r\nfour vowels. However, the high priest did not wear these garments at\r\nother times, but a more plain habit; he only did it when he went into\r\nthe most sacred part of the temple, which he did but once in a year,\r\non that day when our custom is for all of us to keep a fast to God. And\r\nthus much concerning the city and the temple; but for the customs and\r\nlaws hereto relating, we shall speak more accurately another time; for\r\nthere remain a great many things thereto relating which have not been\r\nhere touched upon.\r\n\r\n8. Now as to the tower of Antonia, it was situated at the corner of two\r\ncloisters of the court of the temple; of that on the west, and that on\r\nthe north; it was erected upon a rock of fifty cubits in height, and\r\nwas on a great precipice; it was the work of king Herod, wherein he\r\ndemonstrated his natural magnanimity. In the first place, the\r\nrock itself was covered over with smooth pieces of stone, from its\r\nfoundation, both for ornament, and that any one who would either try to\r\nget up or to go down it might not be able to hold his feet upon it. Next\r\nto this, and before you come to the edifice of the tower itself, there\r\nwas a wall three cubits high; but within that wall all the space of the\r\ntower of Antonia itself was built upon, to the height of forty cubits.\r\nThe inward parts had the largeness and form of a palace, it being parted\r\ninto all kinds of rooms and other conveniences, such as courts, and\r\nplaces for bathing, and broad spaces for camps; insomuch that, by having\r\nall conveniences that cities wanted, it might seem to be composed of\r\nseveral cities, but by its magnificence it seemed a palace. And as the\r\nentire structure resembled that of a tower, it contained also four other\r\ndistinct towers at its four corners; whereof the others were but fifty\r\ncubits high; whereas that which lay upon the southeast corner was\r\nseventy cubits high, that from thence the whole temple might be viewed;\r\nbut on the corner where it joined to the two cloisters of the temple,\r\nit had passages down to them both, through which the guard [for there\r\nalways lay in this tower a Roman legion] went several ways among the\r\ncloisters, with their arms, on the Jewish festivals, in order to watch\r\nthe people, that they might not there attempt to make any innovations;\r\nfor the temple was a fortress that guarded the city, as was the tower\r\nof Antonia a guard to the temple; and in that tower were the guards\r\nof those three 14. There was also a peculiar fortress belonging to the\r\nupper city, which was Herod's palace; but for the hill Bezetha, it was\r\ndivided from the tower Antonia, as we have already told you; and as that\r\nhill on which the tower of Antonia stood was the highest of these three,\r\nso did it adjoin to the new city, and was the only place that hindered\r\nthe sight of the temple on the north. And this shall suffice at present\r\nto have spoken about the city and the walls about it, because I have\r\nproposed to myself to make a more accurate description of it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning The Tyrants Simon And John. How Also As Titus Was\r\n     Going Round The Wall Of This City Nicanor Was Wounded By A\r\n     Dart; Which Accident Provoked Titus To Press On The Siege.\r\n\r\n1. Now the warlike men that were in the city, and the multitude of the\r\nseditious that were with Simon, were ten thousand, besides the Idumeans.\r\nThose ten thousand had fifty commanders, over whom this Simon was\r\nsupreme. The Idumeans that paid him homage were five thousand, and had\r\neight commanders, among whom those of greatest fame were Jacob the son\r\nof Sosas, and Simon the son of Cathlas. Jotre, who had seized upon the\r\ntemple, had six thousand armed men under twenty commanders; the zealots\r\nalso that had come over to him, and left off their opposition, were\r\ntwo thousand four hundred, and had the same commander that they had\r\nformerly, Eleazar, together with Simon the son of Arinus. Now, while\r\nthese factions fought one against another, the people were their prey\r\non both sides, as we have said already; and that part of the people who\r\nwould not join with them in their wicked practices were plundered by\r\nboth factions. Simon held the upper city, and the great wall as far as\r\nCedron, and as much of the old wall as bent from Siloam to the east,\r\nand which went down to the palace of Monobazus, who was king of the\r\nAdiabeni, beyond Euphrates; he also held that fountain, and the Acra,\r\nwhich was no other than the lower city; he also held all that reached to\r\nthe palace of queen Helena, the mother of Monobazus. But John held the\r\ntemple, and the parts thereto adjoining, for a great way, as also Ophla,\r\nand the valley called \"the Valley of Cedron;\" and when the parts that\r\nwere interposed between their possessions were burnt by them, they left\r\na space wherein they might fight with each other; for this internal\r\nsedition did not cease even when the Romans were encamped near their\r\nvery wall. But although they had grown wiser at the first onset the\r\nRomans made upon them, this lasted but a while; for they returned to\r\ntheir former madness, and separated one from another, and fought it out,\r\nand did everything that the besiegers could desire them to do; for they\r\nnever suffered any thing that was worse from the Romans than they made\r\neach other suffer; nor was there any misery endured by the city after\r\nthese men's actions that could be esteemed new. But it was most of all\r\nunhappy before it was overthrown, while those that took it did it a\r\ngreater kindness for I venture to affirm that the sedition destroyed the\r\ncity, and the Romans destroyed the sedition, which it was a much harder\r\nthing to do than to destroy the walls; so that we may justly ascribe our\r\nmisfortunes to our own people, and the just vengeance taken on them to\r\nthe Romans; as to which matter let every one determine by the actions on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\n2. Now when affairs within the city were in this posture, Titus went\r\nround the city on the outside with some chosen horsemen, and looked\r\nabout for a proper place where he might make an impression upon the\r\nwalls; but as he was in doubt where he could possibly make an attack on\r\nany side, [for the place was no way accessible where the valleys were,\r\nand on the other side the first wall appeared too strong to be shaken by\r\nthe engines,] he thereupon thought it best to make his assault upon\r\nthe monument of John the high priest; for there it was that the first\r\nfortification was lower, and the second was not joined to it, the\r\nbuilders neglecting to build strong where the new city was not much\r\ninhabited; here also was an easy passage to the third wall, through\r\nwhich he thought to take the upper city, and, through the tower of\r\nAntonia, the temple itself But at this time, as he was going round about\r\nthe city, one of his friends, whose name was Nicanor, was wounded with a\r\ndart on his left shoulder, as he approached, together with Josephus, too\r\nnear the wall, and attempted to discourse to those that were upon the\r\nwall, about terms of peace; for he was a person known by them. On this\r\naccount it was that Caesar, as soon as he knew their vehemence, that\r\nthey would not hear even such as approached them to persuade them to\r\nwhat tended to their own preservation, was provoked to press on the\r\nsiege. He also at the same time gave his soldiers leave to set the\r\nsuburbs on fire, and ordered that they should bring timber together, and\r\nraise banks against the city; and when he had parted his army into three\r\nparts, in order to set about those works, he placed those that shot\r\ndarts and the archers in the midst of the banks that were then raising;\r\nbefore whom he placed those engines that threw javelins, and darts, and\r\nstones, that he might prevent the enemy from sallying out upon their\r\nworks, and might hinder those that were upon the wall from being able\r\nto obstruct them. So the trees were now cut down immediately, and the\r\nsuburbs left naked. But now while the timber was carrying to raise the\r\nbanks, and the whole army was earnestly engaged in their works, the Jews\r\nwere not, however, quiet; and it happened that the people of Jerusalem,\r\nwho had been hitherto plundered and murdered, were now of good courage,\r\nand supposed they should have a breathing time, while the others were\r\nvery busy in opposing their enemies without the city, and that they\r\nshould now be avenged on those that had been the authors of their\r\nmiseries, in case the Romans did but get the victory.\r\n\r\n3. However, John staid behind, out of his fear of Simon, even while his\r\nown men were earnest in making a sally upon their enemies without. Yet\r\ndid not Simon lie still, for he lay near the place of the siege; he\r\nbrought his engines of war, and disposed of them at due distances upon\r\nthe wall, both those which they took from Cestius formerly, and those\r\nwhich they got when they seized the garrison that lay in the tower\r\nAntonia. But though they had these engines in their possession, they had\r\nso little skill in using them, that they were in great measure useless\r\nto them; but a few there were who had been taught by deserters how to\r\nuse them, which they did use, though after an awkward manner. So they\r\ncast stones and arrows at those that were making the banks; they also\r\nran out upon them by companies, and fought with them. Now those that\r\nwere at work covered themselves with hurdles spread over their banks,\r\nand their engines were opposed to them when they made their excursions.\r\nThe engines, that all the legions had ready prepared for them, were\r\nadmirably contrived; but still more extraordinary ones belonged to the\r\ntenth legion: those that threw darts and those that threw stones were\r\nmore forcible and larger than the rest, by which they not only repelled\r\nthe excursions of the Jews, but drove those away that were upon the\r\nwalls also. Now the stones that were cast were of the weight of a\r\ntalent, and were carried two furlongs and further. The blow they gave\r\nwas no way to be sustained, not only by those that stood first in the\r\nway, but by those that were beyond them for a great space. As for the\r\nJews, they at first watched the coming of the stone, for it was of a\r\nwhite color, and could therefore not only be perceived by the great\r\nnoise it made, but could be seen also before it came by its brightness;\r\naccordingly the watchmen that sat upon the towers gave them notice when\r\nthe engine was let go, and the stone came from it, and cried out aloud,\r\nin their own country language, The Stone Cometh 15 so those that were in\r\nits way stood off, and threw themselves down upon the ground; by which\r\nmeans, and by their thus guarding themselves, the stone fell down\r\nand did them no harm. But the Romans contrived how to prevent that by\r\nblacking the stone, who then could aim at them with success, when the\r\nstone was not discerned beforehand, as it had been till then; and so\r\nthey destroyed many of them at one blow. Yet did not the Jews, under all\r\nthis distress, permit the Romans to raise their banks in quiet; but they\r\nshrewdly and boldly exerted themselves, and repelled them both by night\r\nand by day.\r\n\r\n4. And now, upon the finishing the Roman works, the workmen measured\r\nthe distance there was from the wall, and this by lead and a line, which\r\nthey threw to it from their banks; for they could not measure it any\r\notherwise, because the Jews would shoot at them, if they came to measure\r\nit themselves; and when they found that the engines could reach the\r\nwall, they brought them thither. Then did Titus set his engines at\r\nproper distances, so much nearer to the wall, that the Jews might not\r\nbe able to repel them, and gave orders they should go to work; and when\r\nthereupon a prodigious noise echoed round about from three places, and\r\nthat on the sudden there was a great noise made by the citizens that\r\nwere within the city, and no less a terror fell upon the seditious\r\nthemselves; whereupon both sorts, seeing the common danger they were in,\r\ncontrived to make a like defense. So those of different factions cried\r\nout one to another, that they acted entirely as in concert with their\r\nenemies; whereas they ought however, notwithstanding God did not grant\r\nthem a lasting concord, in their present circumstances, to lay aside\r\ntheir enmities one against another, and to unite together against the\r\nRomans. Accordingly, Simon gave those that came from the temple leave,\r\nby proclamation, to go upon the wall; John also himself, though he could\r\nnot believe Simon was in earnest, gave them the same leave. So on both\r\nsides they laid aside their hatred and their peculiar quarrels, and\r\nformed themselves into one body; they then ran round the walls, and\r\nhaving a vast number of torches with them, they threw them at the\r\nmachines, and shot darts perpetually upon those that impelled those\r\nengines which battered the wall; nay, the bolder sort leaped out by\r\ntroops upon the hurdles that covered the machines, and pulled them to\r\npieces, and fell upon those that belonged to them, and beat them, not\r\nso much by any skill they had, as principally by the boldness of their\r\nattacks. However, Titus himself still sent assistance to those that were\r\nthe hardest set, and placed both horsemen and archers on the several\r\nsides of the engines, and thereby beat off those that brought the fire\r\nto them; he also thereby repelled those that shot stones or darts from\r\nthe towers, and then set the engines to work in good earnest; yet did\r\nnot the wall yield to these blows, excepting where the battering ram of\r\nthe fifteenth legion moved the corner of a tower, while the wall itself\r\ncontinued unhurt; for the wall was not presently in the same danger with\r\nthe tower, which was extant far above it; nor could the fall of that\r\npart of the tower easily break down any part of the wall itself together\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n5. And now the Jews intermitted their sallies for a while; but when they\r\nobserved the Romans dispersed all abroad at their works, and in their\r\nseveral camps, [for they thought the Jews had retired out of weariness\r\nand fear,] they all at once made a sally at the tower Hippicus, through\r\nan obscure gate, and at the same time brought fire to burn the works,\r\nand went boldly up to the Romans, and to their very fortifications\r\nthemselves, where, at the cry they made, those that were near them came\r\npresently to their assistance, and those farther off came running after\r\nthem; and here the boldness of the Jews was too hard for the good order\r\nof the Romans; and as they beat those whom they first fell upon, so they\r\npressed upon those that were now gotten together. So this fight about\r\nthe machines was very hot, while the one side tried hard to set them\r\non fire, and the other side to prevent it; on both sides there was a\r\nconfused cry made, and many of those in the forefront of the battle\r\nwere slain. However, the Jews were now too hard for the Romans, by the\r\nfurious assaults they made like madmen; and the fire caught hold of the\r\nworks, and both all those works, and the engines themselves, had been in\r\ndanger of being burnt, had not many of these select soldiers that came\r\nfrom Alexandria opposed themselves to prevent it, and had they not\r\nbehaved themselves with greater courage than they themselves supposed\r\nthey could have done; for they outdid those in this fight that had\r\ngreater reputation than themselves before. This was the state of things\r\ntill Caesar took the stoutest of his horsemen, and attacked the enemy,\r\nwhile he himself slew twelve of those that were in the forefront of the\r\nJews; which death of these men, when the rest of the multitude saw, they\r\ngave way, and he pursued them, and drove them all into the city, and\r\nsaved the works from the fire. Now it happened at this fight that a\r\ncertain Jew was taken alive, who, by Titus's order, was crucified before\r\nthe wall, to see whether the rest of them would be affrighted, and\r\nabate of their obstinacy. But after the Jews were retired, John, who was\r\ncommander of the Idumeans, and was talking to a certain soldier of his\r\nacquaintance before the wall, was wounded by a dart shot at him by an\r\nArabian, and died immediately, leaving the greatest lamentation to the\r\nJews, and sorrow to the seditious. For he was a man of great eminence,\r\nboth for his actions and his conduct also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How One Of The Towers Erected By The Romans Fell Down Of Its\r\n     Own Accord; And How The Romans After Great Slaughter Had\r\n     Been Made Got Possession Of The First Wall. How Also Titus\r\n     Made His Assaults Upon The Second Wall; As Also Concerning\r\n     Longinus The Roman, And Castor The Jew.\r\n\r\n1. Now, on the next night, a surprising disturbance fell upon the\r\nRomans; for whereas Titus had given orders for the erection of three\r\ntowers of fifty cubits high, that by setting men upon them at every\r\nbank, he might from thence drive those away who were upon the wall, it\r\nso happened that one of these towers fell down about midnight; and as\r\nits fall made a very great noise, fear fell upon the army, and they,\r\nsupposing that the enemy was coming to attack them, ran all to their\r\narms. Whereupon a disturbance and a tumult arose among the legions,\r\nand as nobody could tell what had happened, they went on after a\r\ndisconsolate manner; and seeing no enemy appear, they were afraid one of\r\nanother, and every one demanded of his neighbor the watchword with great\r\nearnestness, as though the Jews had invaded their camp. And now were\r\nthey like people under a panic fear, till Titus was informed of what\r\nhad happened, and gave orders that all should be acquainted with it;\r\nand then, though with some difficulty, they got clear of the disturbance\r\nthey had been under.\r\n\r\n2. Now these towers were very troublesome to the Jews, who otherwise\r\nopposed the Romans very courageously; for they shot at them out of their\r\nlighter engines from those towers, as they did also by those that threw\r\ndarts, and the archers, and those that flung stones. For neither could\r\nthe Jews reach those that were over them, by reason of their height; and\r\nit was not practicable to take them, nor to overturn them, they were so\r\nheavy, nor to set them on fire, because they were covered with plates of\r\niron. So they retired out of the reach of the darts, and did no longer\r\nendeavor to hinder the impression of their rams, which, by continually\r\nbeating upon the wall, did gradually prevail against it; so that\r\nthe wall already gave way to the Nico, for by that name did the Jews\r\nthemselves call the greatest of their engines, because it conquered all\r\nthings. And now they were for a long while grown weary of fighting,\r\nand of keeping guards, and were retired to lodge in the night time at a\r\ndistance from the wall. It was on other accounts also thought by them\r\nto be superfluous to guard the wall, there being besides that two other\r\nfortifications still remaining, and they being slothful, and their\r\ncounsels having been ill concerted on all occasions; so a great many\r\ngrew lazy and retired. Then the Romans mounted the breach, where\r\nNico had made one, and all the Jews left the guarding that wall, and\r\nretreated to the second wall; so those that had gotten over that wall\r\nopened the gates, and received all the army within it. And thus did the\r\nRomans get possession of this first wall, on the fifteenth day of the\r\nsiege, which was the seventh day of the month Artemisius, [Jyar,] when\r\nthey demolished a great part of it, as well as they did of the northern\r\nparts of the city, which had been demolished also by Cestius formerly.\r\n\r\n3. And now Titus pitched his camp within the city, at that place which\r\nwas called \"the Camp of the Assyrians,\" having seized upon all that\r\nlay as far as Cedron, but took care to be out of the reach of the Jews'\r\ndarts. He then presently began his attacks, upon which the Jews divided\r\nthemselves into several bodies, and courageously defended that wall;\r\nwhile John and his faction did it from the tower of Antonia, and from\r\nthe northern cloister of the temple, and fought the Romans before the\r\nmonuments of king Alexander; and Sireoh's army also took for their share\r\nthe spot of ground that was near John's monument, and fortified it as\r\nfar as to that gate where water was brought in to the tower Hippicus.\r\nHowever, the Jews made violent sallies, and that frequently also, and in\r\nbodies together out of the gates, and there fought the Romans; and when\r\nthey were pursued all together to the wall, they were beaten in those\r\nfights, as wanting the skill of the Romans. But when they fought them\r\nfrom the walls, they were too hard for them; the Romans being encouraged\r\nby their power, joined to their skill, as were the Jews by their\r\nboldness, which was nourished by the fear they were in, and that\r\nhardiness which is natural to our nation under calamities; they were\r\nalso encouraged still by the hope of deliverance, as were the Romans by\r\ntheir hopes of subduing them in a little time. Nor did either side grow\r\nweary; but attacks and rightings upon the wall, and perpetual sallies\r\nout in bodies, were there all the day long; nor were there any sort of\r\nwarlike engagements that were not then put in use. And the night itself\r\nhad much ado to part them, when they began to fight in the morning; nay,\r\nthe night itself was passed without sleep on both sides, and was more\r\nuneasy than the day to them, while the one was afraid lest the wall\r\nshould be taken, and the other lest the Jews should make sallies upon\r\ntheir camps; both sides also lay in their armor during the night time,\r\nand thereby were ready at the first appearance of light to go to the\r\nbattle. Now among the Jews the ambition was who should undergo the first\r\ndangers, and thereby gratify their commanders. Above all, they had a\r\ngreat veneration and dread of Simon; and to that degree was he regarded\r\nby every one of those that were under him, that at his command they were\r\nvery ready to kill themselves with their own hands. What made the Romans\r\nso courageous was their usual custom of conquering and disuse of being\r\ndefeated, their constant wars, and perpetual warlike exercises, and\r\nthe grandeur of their dominion; and what was now their chief\r\nencouragement--Titus who was present every where with them all; for\r\nit appeared a terrible thing to grow weary while Caesar was there,\r\nand fought bravely as well as they did, and was himself at once an\r\neye-witness of such as behaved themselves valiantly, and he who was to\r\nreward them also. It was, besides, esteemed an advantage at present\r\nto have any one's valor known by Caesar; on which account many of them\r\nappeared to have more alacrity than strength to answer it. And now, as\r\nthe Jews were about this time standing in array before the wall, and\r\nthat in a strong body, and while both parties were throwing their darts\r\nat each other, Longinus, one of the equestrian order, leaped out of the\r\narmy of the Romans, and leaped into the very midst of the army of the\r\nJews; and as they dispersed themselves upon the attack, he slew two of\r\ntheir men of the greatest courage; one of them he struck in his mouth as\r\nhe was coming to meet him, the other was slain by him by that very dart\r\nwhich he drew out of the body of the other, with which he ran this man\r\nthrough his side as he was running away from him; and when he had done\r\nthis, he first of all ran out of the midst of his enemies to his own\r\nside. So this man signalized himself for his valor, and many there were\r\nwho were ambitious of gaining the like reputation. And now the Jews were\r\nunconcerned at what they suffered themselves from the Romans, and were\r\nonly solicitous about what mischief they could do them; and death itself\r\nseemed a small matter to them, if at the same time they could but kill\r\nany one of their enemies. But Titus took care to secure his own soldiers\r\nfrom harm, as well as to have them overcome their enemies. He also said\r\nthat inconsiderate violence was madness, and that this alone was the\r\ntrue courage that was joined with good conduct. He therefore commanded\r\nhis men to take care, when they fought their enemies, that they received\r\nno harm from them at the same time, and thereby show themselves to be\r\ntruly valiant men.\r\n\r\n4. And now Titus brought one of his engines to the middle tower of the\r\nnorth part of the wall, in which a certain crafty Jew, whose name was\r\nCastor, lay in ambush, with ten others like himself, the rest being fled\r\naway by reason of the archers. These men lay still for a while, as in\r\ngreat fear, under their breastplates; but when the tower was shaken,\r\nthey arose, and Castor did then stretch out his hand, as a petitioner,\r\nand called for Caesar, and by his voice moved his compassion, and begged\r\nof him to have mercy upon them; and Titus, in the innocency of his\r\nheart, believing him to be in earnest, and hoping that the Jews did now\r\nrepent, stopped the working of the battering ram, and forbade them to\r\nshoot at the petitioners, and bid Castor say what he had a mind to say\r\nto him. He said that he would come down, if he would give him his right\r\nhand for his security. To which Titus replied, that he was well pleased\r\nwith such his agreeable conduct, and would be well pleased if all\r\nthe Jews would be of his mind, and that he was ready to give the like\r\nsecurity to the city. Now five of the ten dissembled with him, and\r\npretended to beg for mercy, while the rest cried out aloud that they\r\nwould never be slaves to the Romans, while it was in their power to die\r\nin a state of freedom. Now while these men were quarrelling for a long\r\nwhile, the attack was delayed; Castor also sent to Simon, and told him\r\nthat they might take some time for consultation about what was to be\r\ndone, because he would elude the power of the Romans for a considerable\r\ntime. And at the same time that he sent thus to him, he appeared openly\r\nto exhort those that were obstinate to accept of Titus's hand for their\r\nsecurity; but they seemed very angry at it, and brandished their naked\r\nswords upon the breast-works, and struck themselves upon their breast,\r\nand fell down as if they had been slain. Hereupon Titus, and those with\r\nhim, were amazed at the courage of the men; and as they were not able\r\nto see exactly what was done, they admired at their great fortitude,\r\nand pitied their calamity. During this interval, a certain person shot\r\na dart at Castor, and wounded him in his nose; whereupon he presently\r\npulled out the dart, and showed it to Titus, and complained that this\r\nwas unfair treatment; so Caesar reproved him that shot the dart, and\r\nsent Josephus, who then stood by him, to give his right hand to Castor.\r\nBut Josephus said that he would not go to him, because these pretended\r\npetitioners meant nothing that was good; he also restrained those\r\nfriends of his who were zealous to go to him. But still there was one\r\nEneas, a deserter, who said he would go to him. Castor also called to\r\nthem, that somebody should come and receive the money which he had with\r\nhim; this made Eneas the more earnestly to run to him with his bosom\r\nopen. Then did Castor take up a great stone, and threw it at him, which\r\nmissed him, because he guarded himself against it; but still it wounded\r\nanother soldier that was coming to him. When Caesar understood that this\r\nwas a delusion, he perceived that mercy in war is a pernicious thing,\r\nbecause such cunning tricks have less place under the exercise of\r\ngreater severity. So he caused the engine to work more strongly than\r\nbefore, on account of his anger at the deceit put upon him. But Castor\r\nand his companions set the tower on fire when it began to give way, and\r\nleaped through the flame into a hidden vault that was under it, which\r\nmade the Romans further suppose that they were men of great courage, as\r\nhaving cast themselves into the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The Romans Took The Second Wall Twice, And Got All Ready\r\n     For Taking The Third Wall.\r\n\r\n1. Now Caesar took this wall there on the fifth day after he had taken\r\nthe first; and when the Jews had fled from him, he entered into it with\r\na thousand armed men, and those of his choice troops, and this at a\r\nplace where were the merchants of wool, the braziers, and the market\r\nfor cloth, and where the narrow streets led obliquely to the wall.\r\nWherefore, if Titus had either demolished a larger part of the wall\r\nimmediately, or had come in, and, according to the law of war, had laid\r\nwaste what was left, his victory would not, I suppose, have been mixed\r\nwith any loss to himself. But now, out of the hope he had that he should\r\nmake the Jews ashamed of their obstinacy, by not being willing, when he\r\nwas able, to afflict them more than he needed to do, he did not widen\r\nthe breach of the wall, in order to make a safer retreat upon occasion;\r\nfor he did not think they would lay snares for him that did them such a\r\nkindness. When therefore he came in, he did not permit his soldiers to\r\nkill any of those they caught, nor to set fire to their houses neither;\r\nnay, he gave leave to the seditious, if they had a mind, to fight\r\nwithout any harm to the people, and promised to restore the people's\r\neffects to them; for he was very desirous to preserve the city for his\r\nown sake, and the temple for the sake of the city. As to the people, he\r\nhad them of a long time ready to comply with his proposals; but as to\r\nthe fighting men, this humanity of his seemed a mark of his weakness,\r\nand they imagined that he made these proposals because he was not able\r\nto take the rest of the city. They also threatened death to the people,\r\nif they should any one of them say a word about a surrender. They\r\nmoreover cut the throats of such as talked of a peace, and then attacked\r\nthose Romans that were come within the wall. Some of them they met in\r\nthe narrow streets, and some they fought against from their houses,\r\nwhile they made a sudden sally out at the upper gates, and assaulted\r\nsuch Romans as were beyond the wall, till those that guarded the wall\r\nwere so affrighted, that they leaped down from their towers, and retired\r\nto their several camps: upon which a great noise was made by the Romans\r\nthat were within, because they were encompassed round on every side by\r\ntheir enemies; as also by them that were without, because they were in\r\nfear for those that were left in the city. Thus did the Jews grow more\r\nnumerous perpetually, and had great advantages over the Romans, by their\r\nfull knowledge of those narrow lanes; and they wounded a great many\r\nof them, and fell upon them, and drove them out of the city. Now these\r\nRomans were at present forced to make the best resistance they could;\r\nfor they were not able, in great numbers, to get out at the breach in\r\nthe wall, it was so narrow. It is also probable that all those that\r\nwere gotten within had been cut to pieces, if Titus had not sent them\r\nsuccors; for he ordered the archers to stand at the upper ends of these\r\nnarrow lanes, and he stood himself where was the greatest multitude of\r\nhis enemies, and with his darts he put a stop to them; as with him\r\ndid Domitius Sabinus also, a valiant man, and one that in this battle\r\nappeared so to be. Thus did Caesar continue to shoot darts at the Jews\r\ncontinually, and to hinder them from coming upon his men, and this until\r\nall his soldiers had retreated out of the city.\r\n\r\n2. And thus were the Romans driven out, after they had possessed\r\nthemselves of the second wall. Whereupon the fighting men that were\r\nin the city were lifted up in their minds, and were elevated upon this\r\ntheir good success, and began to think that the Romans would never\r\nventure to come into the city any more; and that if they kept within it\r\nthemselves, they should not be any more conquered. For God had blinded\r\ntheir minds for the transgressions they had been guilty of, nor could\r\nthey see how much greater forces the Romans had than those that were now\r\nexpelled, no more than they could discern how a famine was creeping upon\r\nthem; for hitherto they had fed themselves out of the public miseries,\r\nand drank the blood of the city. But now poverty had for a long time\r\nseized upon the better part, and a great many had died already for want\r\nof necessaries; although the seditious indeed supposed the destruction\r\nof the people to be an easement to themselves; for they desired that\r\nnone others might be preserved but such as were against a peace with the\r\nRomans, and were resolved to live in opposition to them, and they were\r\npleased when the multitude of those of a contrary opinion were consumed,\r\nas being then freed from a heavy burden. And this was their disposition\r\nof mind with regard to those that were within the city, while they\r\ncovered themselves with their armor, and prevented the Romans, when they\r\nwere trying to get into the city again, and made a wall of their own\r\nbodies over against that part of the wall that was cast down. Thus did\r\nthey valiantly defend themselves for three days; but on the fourth day\r\nthey could not support themselves against the vehement assaults of Titus\r\nbut were compelled by force to fly whither they had fled before; so\r\nhe quietly possessed himself again of that wall, and demolished it\r\nentirely. And when he had put a garrison into the towers that were on\r\nthe south parts of the city, he contrived how he might assault the third\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Titus When The Jews Were Not At All Mollified By His Leaving\r\n     Off The Siege For A While, Set Himself Again To Prosecute\r\n     The Same; But Soon Sent Josephus To Discourse With His Own\r\n     Countrymen About Peace.\r\n\r\n1. A Resolution was now taken by Titus to relax the siege for a little\r\nwhile, and to afford the seditious an interval for consideration, and to\r\nsee whether the demolishing of their second wall would not make them\r\na little more compliant, or whether they were not somewhat afraid of\r\na famine, because the spoils they had gotten by rapine would not be\r\nsufficient for them long; so he made use of this relaxation in order to\r\ncompass his own designs. Accordingly, as the usual appointed time when\r\nhe must distribute subsistence money to the soldiers was now come, he\r\ngave orders that the commanders should put the army into battle-array,\r\nin the face of the enemy, and then give every one of the soldiers their\r\npay. So the soldiers, according to custom, opened the cases wherein\r\ntheir arms before lay covered, and marched with their breastplates on,\r\nas did the horsemen lead their horses in their fine trappings. Then did\r\nthe places that were before the city shine very splendidly for a great\r\nway; nor was there any thing so grateful to Titus's own men, or so\r\nterrible to the enemy, as that sight. For the whole old wall, and the\r\nnorth side of the temple, were full of spectators, and one might see\r\nthe houses full of such as looked at them; nor was there any part of the\r\ncity which was not covered over with their multitudes; nay, a very great\r\nconsternation seized upon the hardiest of the Jews themselves, when they\r\nsaw all the army in the same place, together with the fineness of their\r\narms, and the good order of their men. And I cannot but think that\r\nthe seditious would have changed their minds at that sight, unless the\r\ncrimes they had committed against the people had been so horrid, that\r\nthey despaired of forgiveness from the Romans; but as they believed\r\ndeath with torments must be their punishment, if they did not go on in\r\nthe defense of the city, they thought it much better to die in war. Fate\r\nalso prevailed so far over them, that the innocent were to perish with\r\nthe guilty, and the city was to be destroyed with the seditious that\r\nwere in it.\r\n\r\n2. Thus did the Romans spend four days in bringing this\r\nsubsistence-money to the several legions. But on the fifth day, when\r\nno signs of peace appeared to come from the Jews, Titus divided his\r\nlegions, and began to raise banks, both at the tower of Antonia and at\r\nJohn's monument. Now his designs were to take the upper city at that\r\nmonument, and the temple at the tower of Antonia; for if the temple were\r\nnot taken, it would be dangerous to keep the city itself; so at each of\r\nthese parts he raised him banks, each legion raising one. As for those\r\nthat wrought at John's monument, the Idumeans, and those that were in\r\narms with Simon, made sallies upon them, and put some stop to them;\r\nwhile John's party, and the multitude of zealots with them, did the like\r\nto those that were before the tower of Antonia. These Jews were now too\r\nhard for the Romans, not only in direct fighting, because they stood\r\nupon the higher ground, but because they had now learned to use their\r\nown engines; for their continual use of them one day after another did\r\nby degrees improve their skill about them; for of one sort of engines\r\nfor darts they had three hundred, and forty for stones; by the means of\r\nwhich they made it more tedious for the Romans to raise their banks. But\r\nthen Titus, knowing that the city would be either saved or destroyed for\r\nhimself, did not only proceed earnestly in the siege, but did not omit\r\nto have the Jews exhorted to repentance; so he mixed good counsel\r\nwith his works for the siege. And being sensible that exhortations are\r\nfrequently more effectual than arms, he persuaded them to surrender the\r\ncity, now in a manner already taken, and thereby to save themselves, and\r\nsent Josephus to speak to them in their own language; for he imagined\r\nthey might yield to the persuasion of a countryman of their own.\r\n\r\n3. So Josephus went round about the wall, and tried to find a place that\r\nwas out of the reach of their darts, and yet within their hearing,\r\nand besought them, in many words, to spare themselves, to spare their\r\ncountry and their temple, and not to be more obdurate in these cases\r\nthan foreigners themselves; for that the Romans, who had no relation\r\nto those things, had a reverence for their sacred rites and places,\r\nalthough they belonged to their enemies, and had till now kept their\r\nhands off from meddling with them; while such as were brought up under\r\nthem, and, if they be preserved, will be the only people that will reap\r\nthe benefit of them, hurry on to have them destroyed. That certainly\r\nthey have seen their strongest walls demolished, and that the wall still\r\nremaining was weaker than those that were already taken. That they must\r\nknow the Roman power was invincible, and that they had been used to\r\nserve them; for, that in case it be allowed a right thing to fight for\r\nliberty, that ought to have been done at first; but for them that have\r\nonce fallen under the power of the Romans, and have now submitted\r\nto them for so many long years, to pretend to shake off that yoke\r\nafterward, was the work of such as had a mind to die miserably, not of\r\nsuch as were lovers of liberty. Besides, men may well enough grudge at\r\nthe dishonor of owning ignoble masters over them, but ought not to do so\r\nto those who have all things under their command; for what part of the\r\nworld is there that hath escaped the Romans, unless it be such as are\r\nof no use for violent heat, or for violent cold? And evident it is that\r\nfortune is on all hands gone over to them; and that God, when he had\r\ngone round the nations with this dominion, is now settled in Italy.\r\nThat, moreover, it is a strong and fixed law, even among brute beasts,\r\nas well as among men, to yield to those that are too strong for them;\r\nand to suffer those to have the dominion who are too hard for the rest\r\nin war; for which reason it was that their forefathers, who were far\r\nsuperior to them, both in their souls and bodies, and other advantages,\r\ndid yet submit to the Romans, which they would not have suffered, had\r\nthey not known that God was with them. As for themselves, what can they\r\ndepend on in this their opposition, when the greatest part of their city\r\nis already taken? and when those that are within it are under greater\r\nmiseries than if they were taken, although their walls be still\r\nstanding? For that the Romans are not unacquainted with that famine\r\nwhich is in the city, whereby the people are already consumed, and the\r\nfighting men will in a little time be so too; for although the Romans\r\nshould leave off the siege, and not fall upon the city with their swords\r\nin their hands, yet was there an insuperable war that beset them within,\r\nand was augmented every hour, unless they were able to wage war with\r\nfamine, and fight against it, or could alone conquer their natural\r\nappetites. He added this further, how right a thing it was to change\r\ntheir conduct before their calamities were become incurable, and to have\r\nrecourse to such advice as might preserve them, while opportunity was\r\noffered them for so doing; for that the Romans would not be mindful\r\nof their past actions to their disadvantage, unless they persevered in\r\ntheir insolent behavior to the end; because they were naturally mild in\r\ntheir conquests, and preferred what was profitable, before what their\r\npassions dictated to them; which profit of theirs lay not in leaving the\r\ncity empty of inhabitants, nor the country a desert; on which account\r\nCaesar did now offer them his right hand for their security. Whereas,\r\nif he took the city by force, he would not save any of them, and\r\nthis especially, if they rejected his offers in these their utmost\r\ndistresses; for the walls that were already taken could not but assure\r\nthem that the third wall would quickly be taken also. And though their\r\nfortifications should prove too strong for the Romans to break through\r\nthem, yet would the famine fight for the Romans against them.\r\n\r\n4. While Josephus was making this exhortation to the Jews, many of them\r\njested upon him from the wall, and many reproached him; nay, some threw\r\ntheir darts at him: but when he could not himself persuade them by such\r\nopen good advice, he betook himself to the histories belonging to their\r\nown nation, and cried out aloud, \"O miserable creatures! are you so\r\nunmindful of those that used to assist you, that you will fight by your\r\nweapons and by your hands against the Romans? When did we ever conquer\r\nany other nation by such means? and when was it that God, who is the\r\nCreator of the Jewish people, did not avenge them when they had been\r\ninjured? Will not you turn again, and look back, and consider whence it\r\nis that you fight with such violence, and how great a Supporter you have\r\nprofanely abused? Will not you recall to mind the prodigious things done\r\nfor your forefathers and this holy place, and how great enemies of yours\r\nwere by him subdued under you? I even tremble myself in declaring the\r\nworks of God before your ears, that are unworthy to hear them; however,\r\nhearken to me, that you may be informed how you fight not only against\r\nthe Romans, but against God himself. In old times there was one Necao,\r\nking of Egypt, who was also called Pharaoh; he came with a prodigious\r\narmy of soldiers, and seized queen Sarah, the mother of our nation.\r\nWhat did Abraham our progenitor then do? Did he defend himself from\r\nthis injurious person by war, although he had three hundred and eighteen\r\ncaptains under him, and an immense army under each of them? Indeed he\r\ndeemed them to be no number at all without God's assistance, and only\r\nspread out his hands towards this holy place, 16 which you have now\r\npolluted, and reckoned upon him as upon his invincible supporter,\r\ninstead of his own army. Was not our queen sent back, without any\r\ndefilement, to her husband, the very next evening?--while the king of\r\nEgypt fled away, adoring this place which you have defiled by shedding\r\nthereon the blood of your own countrymen; and he also trembled at those\r\nvisions which he saw in the night season, and bestowed both silver and\r\ngold on the Hebrews, as on a people beloved by God. Shall I say nothing,\r\nor shall I mention the removal of our fathers into Egypt, who, when they\r\nwere used tyrannically, and were fallen under the power of foreign kings\r\nfor four hundred years together, and might have defended themselves by\r\nwar and by fighting, did yet do nothing but commit themselves to God!\r\nWho is there that does not know that Egypt was overrun with all sorts of\r\nwild beasts, and consumed by all sorts of distempers? how their land\r\ndid not bring forth its fruit? how the Nile failed of water? how the ten\r\nplagues of Egypt followed one upon another? and how by those means our\r\nfathers were sent away under a guard, without any bloodshed, and\r\nwithout running any dangers, because God conducted them as his peculiar\r\nservants? Moreover, did not Palestine groan 17 under the ravage the\r\nAssyrians made, when they carried away our sacred ark? as did their idol\r\nDagon, and as also did that entire nation of those that carried it away,\r\nhow they were smitten with a loathsome distemper in the secret parts of\r\ntheir bodies, when their very bowels came down together with what they\r\nhad eaten, till those hands that stole it away were obliged to bring it\r\nback again, and that with the sound of cymbals and timbrels, and other\r\noblations, in order to appease the anger of God for their violation of\r\nhis holy ark. It was God who then became our General, and accomplished\r\nthese great things for our fathers, and this because they did not meddle\r\nwith war and fighting, but committed it to him to judge about their\r\naffairs. When Sennacherib, king of Assyria, brought along with him all\r\nAsia, and encompassed this city round with his army, did he fall by the\r\nhands of men? were not those hands lifted up to God in prayers, without\r\nmeddling with their arms, when an angel of God destroyed that prodigious\r\narmy in one night? when the Assyrian king, as he rose the next day,\r\nfound a hundred fourscore and five thousand dead bodies, and when he,\r\nwith the remainder of his army, fled away from the Hebrews, though they\r\nwere unarmed, and did not pursue them. You are also acquainted with the\r\nslavery we were under at Babylon, where the people were captives for\r\nseventy years; yet were they not delivered into freedom again before\r\nGod made Cyrus his gracious instrument in bringing it about; accordingly\r\nthey were set free by him, and did again restore the worship of their\r\nDeliverer at his temple. And, to speak in general, we can produce no\r\nexample wherein our fathers got any success by war, or failed of success\r\nwhen without war they committed themselves to God. When they staid at\r\nhome, they conquered, as pleased their Judge; but when they went out\r\nto fight, they were always disappointed: for example, when the king of\r\nBabylon besieged this very city, and our king Zedekiah fought against\r\nhim, contrary to what predictions were made to him by Jeremiah the\r\nprophet, he was at once taken prisoner, and saw the city and the temple\r\ndemolished. Yet how much greater was the moderation of that king, than\r\nis that of your present governors, and that of the people then under\r\nhim, than is that of you at this time! for when Jeremiah cried out\r\naloud, how very angry God was at them, because of their transgressions,\r\nand told them they should be taken prisoners, unless they would\r\nsurrender up their city, neither did the king nor the people put him to\r\ndeath; but for you, [to pass over what you have done within the city,\r\nwhich I am not able to describe as your wickedness deserves,] you abuse\r\nme, and throw darts at me, who only exhort you to save yourselves, as\r\nbeing provoked when you are put in mind of your sins, and cannot bear\r\nthe very mention of those crimes which you every day perpetrate. For\r\nanother example, when Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, lay before\r\nthis city, and had been guilty of many indignities against God, and our\r\nforefathers met him in arms, they then were slain in the battle, this\r\ncity was plundered by our enemies, and our sanctuary made desolate for\r\nthree years and six months. And what need I bring any more examples?\r\nIndeed what can it be that hath stirred up an army of the Romans against\r\nour nation? Is it not the impiety of the inhabitants? Whence did our\r\nservitude commence? Was it not derived from the seditions that were\r\namong our forefathers, when the madness of Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, and\r\nour mutual quarrels, brought Pompey upon this city, and when God reduced\r\nthose under subjection to the Romans who were unworthy of the liberty\r\nthey had enjoyed? After a siege, therefore, of three months, they were\r\nforced to surrender themselves, although they had not been guilty of\r\nsuch offenses, with regard to our sanctuary and our laws, as you have;\r\nand this while they had much greater advantages to go to war than you\r\nhave. Do not we know what end Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, came\r\nto, under whose reign God provided that this city should be taken again\r\nupon account of the people's offenses? When Herod, the son of Antipater,\r\nbrought upon us Sosius, and Sosius brought upon us the Roman army, they\r\nwere then encompassed and besieged for six months, till, as a punishment\r\nfor their sins, they were taken, and the city was plundered by the\r\nenemy. Thus it appears that arms were never given to our nation, but\r\nthat we are always given up to be fought against, and to be taken; for\r\nI suppose that such as inhabit this holy place ought to commit the\r\ndisposal of all things to God, and then only to disregard the assistance\r\nof men when they resign themselves up to their Arbitrator, who is above.\r\nAs for you, what have you done of those things that are recommended by\r\nour legislator? and what have you not done of those things that he hath\r\ncondemned? How much more impious are you than those who were so quickly\r\ntaken! You have not avoided so much as those sins that are usually\r\ndone in secret; I mean thefts, and treacherous plots against men, and\r\nadulteries. You are quarrelling about rapines and murders, and invent\r\nstrange ways of wickedness. Nay, the temple itself is become the\r\nreceptacle of all, and this Divine place is polluted by the hands of\r\nthose of our own country; which place hath yet been reverenced by the\r\nRomans when it was at a distance from them, when they have suffered many\r\nof their own customs to give place to our law. And, after all this, do\r\nyou expect Him whom you have so impiously abused to be your supporter?\r\nTo be sure then you have a right to be petitioners, and to call upon Him\r\nto assist you, so pure are your hands! Did your king [Hezekiah] lift\r\nup such hands in prayer to God against the king of Assyria, when he\r\ndestroyed that great army in one night? And do the Romans commit such\r\nwickedness as did the king of Assyria, that you may have reason to hope\r\nfor the like vengeance upon them? Did not that king accept of money from\r\nour king on this condition, that he should not destroy the city, and\r\nyet, contrary to the oath he had taken, he came down to burn the temple?\r\nwhile the Romans do demand no more than that accustomed tribute which\r\nour fathers paid to their fathers; and if they may but once obtain that,\r\nthey neither aim to destroy this city, nor to touch this sanctuary; nay,\r\nthey will grant you besides, that your posterity shall be free, and your\r\npossessions secured to you, and will preserve our holy laws inviolate\r\nto you. And it is plain madness to expect that God should appear as well\r\ndisposed towards the wicked as towards the righteous, since he knows\r\nwhen it is proper to punish men for their sins immediately; accordingly\r\nhe brake the power of the Assyrians the very first night that they\r\npitched their camp. Wherefore, had he judged that our nation was worthy\r\nof freedom, or the Romans of punishment, he had immediately inflicted\r\npunishment upon those Romans, as he did upon the Assyrians, when Pompey\r\nbegan to meddle with our nation, or when after him Sosius came up\r\nagainst us, or when Vespasian laid waste Galilee, or, lastly, when Titus\r\ncame first of all near to this city; although Magnus and Sosius did not\r\nonly suffer nothing, but took the city by force; as did Vespasian go\r\nfrom the war he made against you to receive the empire; and as for\r\nTitus, those springs that were formerly almost dried up when they were\r\nunder your power 18 since he is come, run more plentifully than they\r\ndid before; accordingly, you know that Siloam, as well as all the other\r\nsprings that were without the city, did so far fail, that water was sold\r\nby distinct measures; whereas they now have such a great quantity of\r\nwater for your enemies, as is sufficient not only for drink both for\r\nthemselves and their cattle, but for watering their gardens also.\r\nThe same wonderful sign you had also experience of formerly, when the\r\nforementioned king of Babylon made war against us, and when he took the\r\ncity, and burnt the temple; while yet I believe the Jews of that age\r\nwere not so impious as you are. Wherefore I cannot but suppose that God\r\nis fled out of his sanctuary, and stands on the side of those against\r\nwhom you fight. Now even a man, if he be but a good man, will fly from\r\nan impure house, and will hate those that are in it; and do you persuade\r\nyourselves that God will abide with you in your iniquities, who sees all\r\nsecret things, and hears what is kept most private? Now what crime\r\nis there, I pray you, that is so much as kept secret among you, or\r\nis concealed by you? nay, what is there that is not open to your very\r\nenemies? for you show your transgressions after a pompous manner, and\r\ncontend one with another which of you shall be more wicked than another;\r\nand you make a public demonstration of your injustice, as if it were\r\nvirtue. However, there is a place left for your preservation, if you\r\nbe willing to accept of it; and God is easily reconciled to those that\r\nconfess their faults, and repent of them. O hard-hearted wretches as\r\nyou are! cast away all your arms, and take pity of your country already\r\ngoing to ruin; return from your wicked ways, and have regard to the\r\nexcellency of that city which you are going to betray, to that excellent\r\ntemple with the donations of so many countries in it. Who could bear to\r\nbe the first that should set that temple on fire? who could be willing\r\nthat these things should be no more? and what is there that can better\r\ndeserve to be preserved? O insensible creatures, and more stupid than\r\nare the stones themselves! And if you cannot look at these things with\r\ndiscerning eyes, yet, however, have pity upon your families, and set\r\nbefore every one of your eyes your children, and wives, and parents,\r\nwho will be gradually consumed either by famine or by war. I am sensible\r\nthat this danger will extend to my mother, and wife, and to that family\r\nof mine who have been by no means ignoble, and indeed to one that hath\r\nbeen very eminent in old time; and perhaps you may imagine that it is\r\non their account only that I give you this advice; if that be all, kill\r\nthem; nay, take my own blood as a reward, if it may but procure your\r\npreservation; for I am ready to die, in case you will but return to a\r\nsound mind after my death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How A Great Many Of The People Earnestly Endeavored To\r\n     Desert To The Romans; As Also What Intolerable Things Those\r\n     That Staid Behind Suffered By Famine, And The Sad\r\n     Consequences Thereof.\r\n\r\n1. As Josephus was speaking thus with a loud voice, the seditious would\r\nneither yield to what he said, nor did they deem it safe for them to\r\nalter their conduct; but as for the people, they had a great inclination\r\nto desert to the Romans; accordingly, some of them sold what they had,\r\nand even the most precious things that had been laid up as treasures by\r\nthem, for every small matter, and swallowed down pieces of gold, that\r\nthey might not be found out by the robbers; and when they had escaped\r\nto the Romans, went to stool, and had wherewithal to provide plentifully\r\nfor themselves; for Titus let a great number of them go away into the\r\ncountry, whither they pleased. And the main reasons why they were so\r\nready to desert were these: That now they should be freed from those\r\nmiseries which they had endured in that city, and yet should not be in\r\nslavery to the Romans: however, John and Simon, with their factions, did\r\nmore carefully watch these men's going out than they did the coming\r\nin of the Romans; and if any one did but afford the least shadow of\r\nsuspicion of such an intention, his throat was cut immediately.\r\n\r\n2. But as for the richer sort, it proved all one to them whether they\r\nstaid in the city, or attempted to get out of it; for they were equally\r\ndestroyed in both cases; for every such person was put to death under\r\nthis pretense, that they were going to desert, but in reality that the\r\nrobbers might get what they had. The madness of the seditious did also\r\nincrease together with their famine, and both those miseries were\r\nevery day inflamed more and more; for there was no corn which any where\r\nappeared publicly, but the robbers came running into, and searched\r\nmen's private houses; and then, if they found any, they tormented them,\r\nbecause they had denied they had any; and if they found none, they\r\ntormented them worse, because they supposed they had more carefully\r\nconcealed it. The indication they made use of whether they had any or\r\nnot was taken from the bodies of these miserable wretches; which, if\r\nthey were in good case, they supposed they were in no want at all of\r\nfood; but if they were wasted away, they walked off without searching\r\nany further; nor did they think it proper to kill such as these, because\r\nthey saw they would very soon die of themselves for want of food. Many\r\nthere were indeed who sold what they had for one measure; it was of\r\nwheat, if they were of the richer sort; but of barley, if they were\r\npoorer. When these had so done, they shut themselves up in the inmost\r\nrooms of their houses, and ate the corn they had gotten; some did it\r\nwithout grinding it, by reason of the extremity of the want they were\r\nin, and others baked bread of it, according as necessity and fear\r\ndictated to them: a table was no where laid for a distinct meal, but\r\nthey snatched the bread out of the fire, half-baked, and ate it very\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n3. It was now a miserable case, and a sight that would justly bring\r\ntears into our eyes, how men stood as to their food, while the more\r\npowerful had more than enough, and the weaker were lamenting [for want\r\nof it.] But the famine was too hard for all other passions, and it is\r\ndestructive to nothing so much as to modesty; for what was otherwise\r\nworthy of reverence was in this case despised; insomuch that children\r\npulled the very morsels that their fathers were eating out of their very\r\nmouths, and what was still more to be pitied, so did the mothers do\r\nas to their infants; and when those that were most dear were perishing\r\nunder their hands, they were not ashamed to take from them the very last\r\ndrops that might preserve their lives: and while they ate after this\r\nmanner, yet were they not concealed in so doing; but the seditious every\r\nwhere came upon them immediately, and snatched away from them what they\r\nhad gotten from others; for when they saw any house shut up, this was\r\nto them a signal that the people within had gotten some food; whereupon\r\nthey broke open the doors, and ran in, and took pieces of what they were\r\neating almost up out of their very throats, and this by force: the old\r\nmen, who held their food fast, were beaten; and if the women hid what\r\nthey had within their hands, their hair was torn for so doing; nor was\r\nthere any commiseration shown either to the aged or to the infants, but\r\nthey lifted up children from the ground as they hung upon the morsels\r\nthey had gotten, and shook them down upon the floor. But still they were\r\nmore barbarously cruel to those that had prevented their coming in, and\r\nhad actually swallowed down what they were going to seize upon, as if\r\nthey had been unjustly defrauded of their right. They also invented\r\nterrible methods of torments to discover where any food was, and they\r\nwere these to stop up the passages of the privy parts of the miserable\r\nwretches, and to drive sharp stakes up their fundaments; and a man was\r\nforced to bear what it is terrible even to hear, in order to make him\r\nconfess that he had but one loaf of bread, or that he might discover a\r\nhandful of barley-meal that was concealed; and this was done when these\r\ntormentors were not themselves hungry; for the thing had been less\r\nbarbarous had necessity forced them to it; but this was done to keep\r\ntheir madness in exercise, and as making preparation of provisions for\r\nthemselves for the following days. These men went also to meet those\r\nthat had crept out of the city by night, as far as the Roman guards,\r\nto gather some plants and herbs that grew wild; and when those people\r\nthought they had got clear of the enemy, they snatched from them what\r\nthey had brought with them, even while they had frequently entreated\r\nthem, and that by calling upon the tremendous name of God, to give them\r\nback some part of what they had brought; though these would not give\r\nthem the least crumb, and they were to be well contented that they were\r\nonly spoiled, and not slain at the same time.\r\n\r\n4. These were the afflictions which the lower sort of people suffered\r\nfrom these tyrants' guards; but for the men that were in dignity, and\r\nwithal were rich, they were carried before the tyrants themselves; some\r\nof whom were falsely accused of laying treacherous plots, and so were\r\ndestroyed; others of them were charged with designs of betraying the\r\ncity to the Romans; but the readiest way of all was this, to suborn\r\nsomebody to affirm that they were resolved to desert to the enemy. And\r\nhe who was utterly despoiled of what he had by Simon was sent back again\r\nto John, as of those who had been already plundered by Jotre, Simon got\r\nwhat remained; insomuch that they drank the blood of the populace to one\r\nanother, and divided the dead bodies of the poor creatures between them;\r\nso that although, on account of their ambition after dominion, they\r\ncontended with each other, yet did they very well agree in their wicked\r\npractices; for he that did not communicate what he got by the miseries\r\nof others to the other tyrant seemed to be too little guilty, and in one\r\nrespect only; and he that did not partake of what was so communicated to\r\nhim grieved at this, as at the loss of what was a valuable thing, that\r\nhe had no share in such barbarity.\r\n\r\n5. It is therefore impossible to go distinctly over every instance\r\nof these men's iniquity. I shall therefore speak my mind here at once\r\nbriefly:--That neither did any other city ever suffer such miseries,\r\nnor did any age ever breed a generation more fruitful in wickedness than\r\nthis was, from the beginning of the world. Finally, they brought\r\nthe Hebrew nation into contempt, that they might themselves appear\r\ncomparatively less impious with regard to strangers. They confessed\r\nwhat was true, that they were the slaves, the scum, and the spurious\r\nand abortive offspring of our nation, while they overthrew the city\r\nthemselves, and forced the Romans, whether they would or no, to gain a\r\nmelancholy reputation, by acting gloriously against them, and did almost\r\ndraw that fire upon the temple, which they seemed to think came too\r\nslowly; and indeed when they saw that temple burning from the upper\r\ncity, they were neither troubled at it, nor did they shed any tears on\r\nthat account, while yet these passions were discovered among the Romans\r\nthemselves; which circumstances we shall speak of hereafter in their\r\nproper place, when we come to treat of such matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The Jews Were Crucified Before The Walls Of The City\r\n     Concerning Antiochus Epiphanes; And How The Jews Overthrew\r\n     The Banks That Had Been Raised By The Romans.\r\n\r\n1. So now Titus's banks were advanced a great way, notwithstanding his\r\nsoldiers had been very much distressed from the wall. He then sent a\r\nparty of horsemen, and ordered they should lay ambushes for those that\r\nwent out into the valleys to gather food. Some of these were indeed\r\nfighting men, who were not contented with what they got by rapine;\r\nbut the greater part of them were poor people, who were deterred from\r\ndeserting by the concern they were under for their own relations;\r\nfor they could not hope to escape away, together with their wives and\r\nchildren, without the knowledge of the seditious; nor could they think\r\nof leaving these relations to be slain by the robbers on their account;\r\nnay, the severity of the famine made them bold in thus going out; so\r\nnothing remained but that, when they were concealed from the robbers,\r\nthey should be taken by the enemy; and when they were going to be taken,\r\nthey were forced to defend themselves for fear of being punished;\r\nas after they had fought, they thought it too late to make any\r\nsupplications for mercy; so they were first whipped, and then tormented\r\nwith all sorts of tortures, before they died, and were then crucified\r\nbefore the wall of the city. This miserable procedure made Titus greatly\r\nto pity them, while they caught every day five hundred Jews; nay, some\r\ndays they caught more: yet it did not appear to be safe for him to let\r\nthose that were taken by force go their way, and to set a guard over so\r\nmany he saw would be to make such as great deal them useless to him. The\r\nmain reason why he did not forbid that cruelty was this, that he hoped\r\nthe Jews might perhaps yield at that sight, out of fear lest they might\r\nthemselves afterwards be liable to the same cruel treatment. So the\r\nsoldiers, out of the wrath and hatred they bore the Jews, nailed those\r\nthey caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the\r\ncrosses, by way of jest, when their multitude was so great, that room\r\nwas wanting for the crosses, and crosses wanting for the bodies. 19\r\n\r\n2. But so far were the seditious from repenting at this sad sight, that,\r\non the contrary, they made the rest of the multitude believe otherwise;\r\nfor they brought the relations of those that had deserted upon the\r\nwall, with such of the populace as were very eager to go over upon the\r\nsecurity offered them, and showed them what miseries those underwent\r\nwho fled to the Romans; and told them that those who were caught were\r\nsupplicants to them, and not such as were taken prisoners. This sight\r\nkept many of those within the city who were so eager to desert, till\r\nthe truth was known; yet did some of them run away immediately as unto\r\ncertain punishment, esteeming death from their enemies to be a quiet\r\ndeparture, if compared with that by famine. So Titus commanded that the\r\nhands of many of those that were caught should be cut off, that they\r\nmight not be thought deserters, and might be credited on account of the\r\ncalamity they were under, and sent them in to John and Simon, with this\r\nexhortation, that they would now at length leave off [their madness],\r\nand not force him to destroy the city, whereby they would have those\r\nadvantages of repentance, even in their utmost distress, that they would\r\npreserve their own lives, and so find a city of their own, and that\r\ntemple which was their peculiar. He then went round about the banks that\r\nwere cast up, and hastened them, in order to show that his words\r\nshould in no long time be followed by his deeds. In answer to which the\r\nseditious cast reproaches upon Caesar himself, and upon his father also,\r\nand cried out, with a loud voice, that they contemned death, and\r\ndid well in preferring it before slavery; that they would do all the\r\nmischief to the Romans they could while they had breath in them; and\r\nthat for their own city, since they were, as he said, to be destroyed,\r\nthey had no concern about it, and that the world itself was a better\r\ntemple to God than this. That yet this temple would be preserved by him\r\nthat inhabited therein, whom they still had for their assistant in this\r\nwar, and did therefore laugh at all his threatenings, which would come\r\nto nothing, because the conclusion of the whole depended upon God only.\r\nThese words were mixed with reproaches, and with them they made a mighty\r\nclamor.\r\n\r\n3. In the mean time Antiochus Epiphanes came to the city, having with\r\nhim a considerable number of other armed men, and a band called the\r\nMacedonian band about him, all of the same age, tall, and just past\r\ntheir childhood, armed, and instructed after the Macedonian manner,\r\nwhence it was that they took that name. Yet were many of them unworthy\r\nof so famous a nation; for it had so happened, that the king of\r\nCommagene had flourished more than any other kings that were under the\r\npower of the Romans, till a change happened in his condition; and when\r\nhe was become an old man, he declared plainly that we ought not to call\r\nany man happy before he is dead. But this son of his, who was then\r\ncome thither before his father was decaying, said that he could not but\r\nwonder what made the Romans so tardy in making their attacks upon the\r\nwall. Now he was a warlike man, and naturally bold in exposing himself\r\nto dangers; he was also so strong a man, that his boldness seldom failed\r\nof having success. Upon this Titus smiled, and said he would share the\r\npains of an attack with him. However, Antiochus went as he then was, and\r\nwith his Macedonians made a sudden assault upon the wall; and, indeed,\r\nfor his own part, his strength and skill were so great, that he guarded\r\nhimself from the Jewish darts, and yet shot his darts at them, while yet\r\nthe young men with him were almost all sorely galled; for they had so\r\ngreat a regard to the promises that had been made of their courage, that\r\nthey would needs persevere in their fighting, and at length many of them\r\nretired, but not till they were wounded; and then they perceived that\r\ntrue Macedonians, if they were to be conquerors, must have Alexander's\r\ngood fortune also.\r\n\r\n4. Now as the Romans began to raise their banks on the twelfth day of\r\nthe month Artemisius, [Jyar,] so had they much ado to finish them by\r\nthe twenty-ninth day of the same month, after they had labored hard for\r\nseventeen days continually. For there were now four great banks raised,\r\none of which was at the tower Antonia; this was raised by the fifth\r\nlegion, over against the middle of that pool which was called Struthius.\r\nAnother was cast up by the twelfth legion, at the distance of about\r\ntwenty cubits from the other. But the labors of the tenth legion, which\r\nlay a great way off these, were on the north quarter, and at the pool\r\ncalled Amygdalon; as was that of the fifteenth legion about thirty\r\ncubits from it, and at the high priest's monument. And now, when the\r\nengines were brought, John had from within undermined the space that was\r\nover against the tower of Antonia, as far as the banks themselves,\r\nand had supported the ground over the mine with beams laid across one\r\nanother, whereby the Roman works stood upon an uncertain foundation.\r\nThen did he order such materials to be brought in as were daubed over\r\nwith pitch and bitumen, and set them on fire; and as the cross beams\r\nthat supported the banks were burning, the ditch yielded on the\r\nsudden, and the banks were shaken down, and fell into the ditch with a\r\nprodigious noise. Now at the first there arose a very thick smoke and\r\ndust, as the fire was choked with the fall of the bank; but as the\r\nsuffocated materials were now gradually consumed, a plain flame brake\r\nout; on which sudden appearance of the flame a consternation fell upon\r\nthe Romans, and the shrewdness of the contrivance discouraged them; and\r\nindeed this accident coming upon them at a time when they thought they\r\nhad already gained their point, cooled their hopes for the time to\r\ncome. They also thought it would be to no purpose to take the pains\r\nto extinguish the fire, since if it were extinguished, the banks were\r\nswallowed up already [and become useless to them].\r\n\r\n5. Two days after this, Simon and his party made an attempt to destroy\r\nthe other banks; for the Romans had brought their engines to bear there,\r\nand began already to make the wall shake. And here one Tephtheus, of\r\nGarsis, a city of Galilee, and Megassarus, one who was derived from some\r\nof queen Mariamne's servants, and with them one from Adiabene, he was\r\nthe son of Nabateus, and called by the name of Chagiras, from the ill\r\nfortune he had, the word signifying \"a lame man,\" snatched some torches,\r\nand ran suddenly upon the engines. Nor were there during this war any\r\nmen that ever sallied out of the city who were their superiors, either\r\nin their boldness, or in the terror they struck into their enemies. For\r\nthey ran out upon the Romans, not as if they were enemies, but friends,\r\nwithout fear or delay; nor did they leave their enemies till they had\r\nrushed violently through the midst of them, and set their machines on\r\nfire. And though they had darts thrown at them on every side, and were\r\non every side assaulted with their enemies' swords, yet did they not\r\nwithdraw themselves out of the dangers they were in, till the fire had\r\ncaught hold of the instruments; but when the flame went up, the Romans\r\ncame running from their camp to save their engines. Then did the\r\nJews hinder their succors from the wall, and fought with those that\r\nendeavored to quench the fire, without any regard to the danger their\r\nbodies were in. So the Romans pulled the engines out of the fire, while\r\nthe hurdles that covered them were on fire; but the Jews caught hold\r\nof the battering rams through the flame itself, and held them fast,\r\nalthough the iron upon them was become red hot; and now the fire spread\r\nitself from the engines to the banks, and prevented those that came to\r\ndefend them; and all this while the Romans were encompassed round about\r\nwith the flame; and, despairing of saving their works from it, they\r\nretired to their camp. Then did the Jews become still more and more\r\nin number by the coming of those that were within the city to their\r\nassistance; and as they were very bold upon the good success they\r\nhad had, their violent assaults were almost irresistible; nay, they\r\nproceeded as far as the fortifications of the enemies' camp, and fought\r\nwith their guards. Now there stood a body of soldiers in array before\r\nthat camp, which succeeded one another by turns in their armor; and as\r\nto those, the law of the Romans was terrible, that he who left his post\r\nthere, let the occasion be whatsoever it might be, he was to die for\r\nit; so that body of soldiers, preferring rather to die in fighting\r\ncourageously, than as a punishment for their cowardice, stood firm; and\r\nat the necessity these men were in of standing to it, many of the others\r\nthat had run away, out of shame, turned back again; and when they had\r\nset the engines against the wall, they put the multitude from coming\r\nmore of them out of the city, [which they could the more easily do]\r\nbecause they had made no provision for preserving or guarding their\r\nbodies at this time; for the Jews fought now hand to hand with all that\r\ncame in their way, and, without any caution, fell against the points of\r\ntheir enemies' spears, and attacked them bodies against bodies; for they\r\nwere now too hard for the Romans, not so much by their other warlike\r\nactions, as by these courageous assaults they made upon them; and the\r\nRomans gave way more to their boldness than they did to the sense of the\r\nharm they had received from them.\r\n\r\n6. And now Titus was come from the tower of Antonia, whither he was\r\ngone to look out for a place for raising other banks, and reproached the\r\nsoldiers greatly for permitting their own walls to be in danger, when\r\nthey had taken the wails of their enemies, and sustained the fortune\r\nof men besieged, while the Jews were allowed to sally out against them,\r\nthough they were already in a sort of prison. He then went round about\r\nthe enemy with some chosen troops, and fell upon their flank himself; so\r\nthe Jews, who had been before assaulted in their faces, wheeled about to\r\nTitus, and continued the fight. The armies also were now mixed one among\r\nanother, and the dust that was raised so far hindered them from seeing\r\none another, and the noise that was made so far hindered them from\r\nhearing one another, that neither side could discern an enemy from a\r\nfriend. However, the Jews did not flinch, though not so much from their\r\nreal strength, as from their despair of deliverance. The Romans also\r\nwould not yield, by reason of the regard they had to glory, and to\r\ntheir reputation in war, and because Caesar himself went into the danger\r\nbefore them; insomuch that I cannot but think the Romans would in the\r\nconclusion have now taken even the whole multitude of the Jews, so\r\nvery angry were they at them, had these not prevented the upshot of\r\nthe battle, and retired into the city. However, seeing the banks of the\r\nRomans were demolished, these Romans were very much cast down upon the\r\nloss of what had cost them so long pains, and this in one hour's time.\r\nAnd many indeed despaired of taking the city with their usual engines of\r\nwar only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Titus Thought Fit To Encompass The City Round With A Wall;\r\n     After Which The Famine Consumed The People By Whole Houses\r\n     And Families Together.\r\n\r\n1. And now did Titus consult with his commanders what was to be done.\r\nThose that were of the warmest tempers thought he should bring the whole\r\narmy against the city and storm the wall; for that hitherto no more\r\nthan a part of their army had fought with the Jews; but that in case the\r\nentire army was to come at once, they would not be able to sustain their\r\nattacks, but would be overwhelmed by their darts. But of those that were\r\nfor a more cautious management, some were for raising their banks again;\r\nand others advised to let the banks alone, but to lie still before the\r\ncity, to guard against the coming out of the Jews, and against their\r\ncarrying provisions into the city, and so to leave the enemy to the\r\nfamine, and this without direct fighting with them; for that despair was\r\nnot to be conquered, especially as to those who are desirous to die by\r\nthe sword, while a more terrible misery than that is reserved for them.\r\nHowever, Titus did not think it fit for so great an army to lie entirely\r\nidle, and that yet it was in vain to fight with those that would be\r\ndestroyed one by another; he also showed them how impracticable it was\r\nto cast up any more banks, for want of materials, and to guard against\r\nthe Jews coming out still more impracticable; as also, that to encompass\r\nthe whole city round with his army was not very easy, by reason of its\r\nmagnitude, and the difficulty of the situation, and on other accounts\r\ndangerous, upon the sallies the Jews might make out of the city. For\r\nalthough they might guard the known passages out of the place, yet would\r\nthey, when they found themselves under the greatest distress, contrive\r\nsecret passages out, as being well acquainted with all such places; and\r\nif any provisions were carried in by stealth, the siege would thereby be\r\nlonger delayed. He also owned that he was afraid that the length of time\r\nthus to be spent would diminish the glory of his success; for though\r\nit be true that length of time will perfect every thing, yet that to\r\ndo what we do in a little time is still necessary to the gaining\r\nreputation. That therefore his opinion was, that if they aimed at\r\nquickness joined with security, they must build a wall round about the\r\nwhole city; which was, he thought, the only way to prevent the Jews from\r\ncoming out any way, and that then they would either entirely despair of\r\nsaving the city, and so would surrender it up to him, or be still the\r\nmore easily conquered when the famine had further weakened them; for\r\nthat besides this wall, he would not lie entirely at rest afterward, but\r\nwould take care then to have banks raised again, when those that would\r\noppose them were become weaker. But that if any one should think such a\r\nwork to be too great, and not to be finished without much difficulty, he\r\nought to consider that it is not fit for Romans to undertake any small\r\nwork, and that none but God himself could with ease accomplish any great\r\nthing whatsoever.\r\n\r\n2. These arguments prevailed with the commanders. So Titus gave orders\r\nthat the army should be distributed to their several shares of this\r\nwork; and indeed there now came upon the soldiers a certain divine fury,\r\nso that they did not only part the whole wall that was to be built\r\namong them, nor did only one legion strive with another, but the lesser\r\ndivisions of the army did the same; insomuch that each soldier was\r\nambitious to please his decurion, each decurion his centurion, each\r\ncenturion his tribune, and the ambition of the tribunes was to please\r\ntheir superior commanders, while Caesar himself took notice of and\r\nrewarded the like contention in those commanders; for he went round\r\nabout the works many times every day, and took a view of what was done.\r\nTitus began the wall from the camp of the Assyrians, where his own camp\r\nwas pitched, and drew it down to the lower parts of Cenopolis; thence\r\nit went along the valley of Cedron, to the Mount of Olives; it then\r\nbent towards the south, and encompassed the mountain as far as the rock\r\ncalled Peristereon, and that other hill which lies next it, and is over\r\nthe valley which reaches to Siloam; whence it bended again to the west,\r\nand went down to the valley of the Fountain, beyond which it went up\r\nagain at the monument of Ananus the high priest, and encompassing that\r\nmountain where Pompey had formerly pitched his camp, it returned back\r\nto the north side of the city, and was carried on as far as a certain\r\nvillage called \"The House of the Erebinthi;\" after which it encompassed\r\nHerod's monument, and there, on the east, was joined to Titus's own\r\ncamp, where it began. Now the length of this wall was forty furlongs,\r\none only abated. Now at this wall without were erected thirteen places\r\nto keep garrison in, whose circumferences, put together, amounted to\r\nten furlongs; the whole was completed in three days; so that what would\r\nnaturally have required some months was done in so short an interval as\r\nis incredible. When Titus had therefore encompassed the city with this\r\nwall, and put garrisons into proper places, he went round the wall, at\r\nthe first watch of the night, and observed how the guard was kept; the\r\nsecond watch he allotted to Alexander; the commanders of legions took\r\nthe third watch. They also cast lots among themselves who should be upon\r\nthe watch in the night time, and who should go all night long round the\r\nspaces that were interposed between the garrisons.\r\n\r\n3. So all hope of escaping was now cut off from the Jews, together with\r\ntheir liberty of going out of the city. Then did the famine widen its\r\nprogress, and devoured the people by whole houses and families; the\r\nupper rooms were full of women and children that were dying by famine,\r\nand the lanes of the city were full of the dead bodies of the aged; the\r\nchildren also and the young men wandered about the market-places like\r\nshadows, all swelled with the famine, and fell down dead, wheresoever\r\ntheir misery seized them. As for burying them, those that were sick\r\nthemselves were not able to do it; and those that were hearty and well\r\nwere deterred from doing it by the great multitude of those dead bodies,\r\nand by the uncertainty there was how soon they should die themselves;\r\nfor many died as they were burying others, and many went to their\r\ncoffins before that fatal hour was come. Nor was there any lamentations\r\nmade under these calamities, nor were heard any mournful complaints;\r\nbut the famine confounded all natural passions; for those who were just\r\ngoing to die looked upon those that were gone to rest before them with\r\ndry eyes and open mouths. A deep silence also, and a kind of deadly\r\nnight, had seized upon the city; while yet the robbers were still more\r\nterrible than these miseries were themselves; for they brake open those\r\nhouses which were no other than graves of dead bodies, and plundered\r\nthem of what they had; and carrying off the coverings of their bodies,\r\nwent out laughing, and tried the points of their swords in their dead\r\nbodies; and, in order to prove what metal they were made of they thrust\r\nsome of those through that still lay alive upon the ground; but for\r\nthose that entreated them to lend them their right hand and their sword\r\nto despatch them, they were too proud to grant their requests, and left\r\nthem to be consumed by the famine. Now every one of these died with\r\ntheir eyes fixed upon the temple, and left the seditious alive behind\r\nthem. Now the seditious at first gave orders that the dead should be\r\nburied out of the public treasury, as not enduring the stench of their\r\ndead bodies. But afterwards, when they could not do that, they had them\r\ncast down from the walls into the valleys beneath.\r\n\r\n4. However, when Titus, in going his rounds along those valleys, saw\r\nthem full of dead bodies, and the thick putrefaction running about them,\r\nhe gave a groan; and, spreading out his hands to heaven, called God to\r\nwitness that this was not his doing; and such was the sad case of\r\nthe city itself. But the Romans were very joyful, since none of the\r\nseditious could now make sallies out of the city, because they were\r\nthemselves disconsolate, and the famine already touched them also. These\r\nRomans besides had great plenty of corn and other necessaries out of\r\nSyria, and out of the neighboring provinces; many of whom would stand\r\nnear to the wall of the city, and show the people what great quantities\r\nof provisions they had, and so make the enemy more sensible of their\r\nfamine, by the great plenty, even to satiety, which they had themselves.\r\nHowever, when the seditious still showed no inclinations of yielding,\r\nTitus, out of his commiseration of the people that remained, and out\r\nof his earnest desire of rescuing what was still left out of these\r\nmiseries, began to raise his banks again, although materials for them\r\nwere hard to be come at; for all the trees that were about the city had\r\nbeen already cut down for the making of the former banks. Yet did the\r\nsoldiers bring with them other materials from the distance of ninety\r\nfurlongs, and thereby raised banks in four parts, much greater than the\r\nformer, though this was done only at the tower of Antonia. So Caesar\r\nwent his rounds through the legions, and hastened on the works, and\r\nshowed the robbers that they were now in his hands. But these men, and\r\nthese only, were incapable of repenting of the wickednesses they had\r\nbeen guilty of; and separating their souls from their bodies, they used\r\nthem both as if they belonged to other folks, and not to themselves. For\r\nno gentle affection could touch their souls, nor could any pain affect\r\ntheir bodies, since they could still tear the dead bodies of the people\r\nas dogs do, and fill the prisons with those that were sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Great Slaughters And Sacrilege That Were In Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1. Accordingly Simon would not suffer Matthias, by whose means he got\r\npossession of the city, to go off without torment. This Matthias was the\r\nson of Boethus, and was one of the high priests, one that had been very\r\nfaithful to the people, and in great esteem with them; he, when the\r\nmultitude were distressed by the zealots, among whom John was numbered,\r\npersuaded the people to admit this Simon to come in to assist them,\r\nwhile he had made no terms with him, nor expected any thing that was\r\nevil from him. But when Simon was come in, and had gotten the city under\r\nhis power, he esteemed him that had advised them to admit him as his\r\nenemy equally with the rest, as looking upon that advice as a piece\r\nof his simplicity only; so he had him then brought before him, and\r\ncondemned to die for being on the side of the Romans, without giving him\r\nleave to make his defense. He condemned also his three sons to die with\r\nhim; for as to the fourth, he prevented him by running away to Titus\r\nbefore. And when he begged for this, that he might be slain before his\r\nsons, and that as a favor, on account that he had procured the gates of\r\nthe city to be opened to him, he gave order that he should be slain the\r\nlast of them all; so he was not slain till he had seen his sons slain\r\nbefore his eyes, and that by being produced over against the Romans; for\r\nsuch a charge had Simon given to Artanus, the son of Bamadus, who was\r\nthe most barbarous of all his guards. He also jested upon him, and told\r\nhim that he might now see whether those to whom he intended to go over\r\nwould send him any succors or not; but still he forbade their dead\r\nbodies should be buried. After the slaughter of these, a certain priest,\r\nAnanias, the son of Masambalus, a person of eminency, as also Aristens,\r\nthe scribe of the sanhedrim, and born at Emmaus, and with them fifteen\r\nmen of figure among the people, were slain. They also kept Josephus's\r\nfather in prison, and made public proclamation, that no citizen\r\nwhosoever should either speak to him himself, or go into his company\r\namong others, for fear he should betray them. They also slew such as\r\njoined in lamenting these men, without any further examination.\r\n\r\n2. Now when Judas, the son of Judas, who was one of Simon's under\r\nofficers, and a person intrusted by him to keep one of the towers, saw\r\nthis procedure of Simon, he called together ten of those under him, that\r\nwere most faithful to him, [perhaps this was done partly out of pity\r\nto those that had so barbarously been put to death, but principally in\r\norder to provide for his own safety,] and spoke thus to them: \"How long\r\nshall we bear these miseries? or what hopes have we of deliverance by\r\nthus continuing faithful to such wicked wretches? Is not the famine\r\nalready come against us? Are not the Romans in a manner gotten within\r\nthe city? Is not Simon become unfaithful to his benefactors? and\r\nis there not reason to fear he will very soon bring us to the like\r\npunishment, while the security the Romans offer us is sure? Come on,\r\nlet us surrender up this wall, and save ourselves and the city. Nor\r\nwill Simon be very much hurt, if, now he despairs of deliverance, he\r\nbe brought to justice a little sooner than he thinks on.\" Now these ten\r\nwere prevailed upon by those arguments; so he sent the rest of those\r\nthat were under him, some one way, and some another, that no discovery\r\nmight be made of what they had resolved upon. Accordingly, he called to\r\nthe Romans from the tower about the third hour; but they, some of them\r\nout of pride, despised what he said, and others of them did not believe\r\nhim to be in earnest, though the greatest number delayed the matter,\r\nas believing they should get possession of the city in a little time,\r\nwithout any hazard. But when Titus was just coming thither with his\r\narmed men, Simon was acquainted with the matter before he came,\r\nand presently took the tower into his own custody, before it was\r\nsurrendered, and seized upon these men, and put them to death in the\r\nsight of the Romans themselves; and when he had mangled their dead\r\nbodies, he threw them down before the wall of the city.\r\n\r\n3. In the mean time, Josephus, as he was going round the city, had his\r\nhead wounded by a stone that was thrown at him; upon which he fell down\r\nas giddy. Upon which fall of his the Jews made a sally, and he had been\r\nhurried away into the city, if Caesar had not sent men to protect him\r\nimmediately; and as these men were fighting, Josephus was taken up,\r\nthough he heard little of what was done. So the seditious supposed they\r\nhad now slain that man whom they were the most desirous of killing, and\r\nmade thereupon a great noise, in way of rejoicing. This accident\r\nwas told in the city, and the multitude that remained became very\r\ndisconsolate at the news, as being persuaded that he was really dead, on\r\nwhose account alone they could venture to desert to the Romans. But when\r\nJosephus's mother heard in prison that her son was dead, she said to\r\nthose that watched about her, That she had always been of opinion, since\r\nthe siege of Jotapata, [that he would be slain,] and she should never\r\nenjoy him alive any more. She also made great lamentation privately to\r\nthe maid-servants that were about her, and said, That this was all the\r\nadvantage she had of bringing so extraordinary a person as this son into\r\nthe world; that she should not be able even to bury that son of hers,\r\nby whom she expected to have been buried herself. However, this false\r\nreport did not put his mother to pain, nor afford merriment to the\r\nrobbers, long; for Josephus soon recovered of his wound, and came\r\nout, and cried out aloud, That it would not be long ere they should\r\nbe punished for this wound they had given him. He also made a fresh\r\nexhortation to the people to come out upon the security that would be\r\ngiven them. This sight of Josephus encouraged the people greatly, and\r\nbrought a great consternation upon the seditious.\r\n\r\n4. Hereupon some of the deserters, having no other way, leaped down from\r\nthe wall immediately, while others of them went out of the city with\r\nstones, as if they would fight them; but thereupon they fled away to the\r\nRomans. But here a worse fate accompanied these than what they had found\r\nwithin the city; and they met with a quicker despatch from the too great\r\nabundance they had among the Romans, than they could have done from the\r\nfamine among the Jews; for when they came first to the Romans, they were\r\npuffed up by the famine, and swelled like men in a dropsy; after which\r\nthey all on the sudden overfilled those bodies that were before empty,\r\nand so burst asunder, excepting such only as were skillful enough to\r\nrestrain their appetites, and by degrees took in their food into bodies\r\nunaccustomed thereto. Yet did another plague seize upon those that were\r\nthus preserved; for there was found among the Syrian deserters a certain\r\nperson who was caught gathering pieces of gold out of the excrements\r\nof the Jews' bellies; for the deserters used to swallow such pieces of\r\ngold, as we told you before, when they came out, and for these did the\r\nseditious search them all; for there was a great quantity of gold in the\r\ncity, insomuch that as much was now sold [in the Roman camp] for\r\ntwelve Attic [drams], as was sold before for twenty-five. But when this\r\ncontrivance was discovered in one instance, the fame of it filled their\r\nseveral camps, that the deserters came to them full of gold. So the\r\nmultitude of the Arabians, with the Syrians, cut up those that came as\r\nsupplicants, and searched their bellies. Nor does it seem to me that any\r\nmisery befell the Jews that was more terrible than this, since in one\r\nnight's time about two thousand of these deserters were thus dissected.\r\n\r\n5. When Titus came to the knowledge of this wicked practice, he had like\r\nto have surrounded those that had been guilty of it with his horse, and\r\nhave shot them dead; and he had done it, had not their number been so\r\nvery great, and those that were liable to this punishment would have\r\nbeen manifold more than those whom they had slain. However, he called\r\ntogether the commanders of the auxiliary troops he had with him, as well\r\nas the commanders of the Roman legions, [for some of his own soldiers\r\nhad been also guilty herein, as he had been informed,] and had great\r\nindignation against both sorts of them, and said to them, \"What! have\r\nany of my own soldiers done such things as this out of the uncertain\r\nhope of gain, without regarding their own weapons, which are made of\r\nsilver and gold? Moreover, do the Arabians and Syrians now first of\r\nall begin to govern themselves as they please, and to indulge their\r\nappetites in a foreign war, and then, out of their barbarity in\r\nmurdering men, and out of their hatred to the Jews, get it ascribed to\r\nthe Romans?\" for this infamous practice was said to be spread among some\r\nof his own soldiers also. Titus then threatened that he would put such\r\nmen to death, if any of them were discovered to be so insolent as to\r\ndo so again; moreover, he gave it in charge to the legions, that they\r\nshould make a search after such as were suspected, and should bring\r\nthem to him. But it appeared that the love of money was too hard for all\r\ntheir dread of punishment, and a vehement desire of gain is natural to\r\nmen, and no passion is so venturesome as covetousness; otherwise such\r\npassions have certain bounds, and are subordinate to fear. But in\r\nreality it was God who condemned the whole nation, and turned every\r\ncourse that was taken for their preservation to their destruction. This,\r\ntherefore, which was forbidden by Caesar under such a threatening, was\r\nventured upon privately against the deserters, and these barbarians\r\nwould go out still, and meet those that ran away before any saw them,\r\nand looking about them to see that no Roman spied them, they dissected\r\nthem, and pulled this polluted money out of their bowels; which money\r\nwas still found in a few of them, while yet a great many were destroyed\r\nby the bare hope there was of thus getting by them, which miserable\r\ntreatment made many that were deserting to return back again into the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n6. But as for John, when he could no longer plunder the people,\r\nhe betook himself to sacrilege, and melted down many of the sacred\r\nutensils, which had been given to the temple; as also many of those\r\nvessels which were necessary for such as ministered about holy things,\r\nthe caldrons, the dishes, and the tables; nay, he did not abstain from\r\nthose pouring vessels that were sent them by Augustus and his wife; for\r\nthe Roman emperors did ever both honor and adorn this temple; whereas\r\nthis man, who was a Jew, seized upon what were the donations of\r\nforeigners, and said to those that were with him, that it was proper for\r\nthem to use Divine things, while they were fighting for the Divinity,\r\nwithout fear, and that such whose warfare is for the temple should live\r\nof the temple; on which account he emptied the vessels of that\r\nsacred wine and oil, which the priests kept to be poured on the\r\nburnt-offerings, and which lay in the inner court of the temple, and\r\ndistributed it among the multitude, who, in their anointing themselves\r\nand drinking, used [each of them] above an hin of them. And here I\r\ncannot but speak my mind, and what the concern I am under dictates to\r\nme, and it is this: I suppose, that had the Romans made any longer delay\r\nin coming against these villains, that the city would either have been\r\nswallowed up by the ground opening upon them, or been overflowed by\r\nwater, or else been destroyed by such thunder as the country of Sodom\r\n20 perished by, for it had brought forth a generation of men much more\r\natheistical than were those that suffered such punishments; for by their\r\nmadness it was that all the people came to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n7. And, indeed, why do I relate these particular calamities? while\r\nManneus, the son of Lazarus, came running to Titus at this very time,\r\nand told him that there had been carried out through that one gate,\r\nwhich was intrusted to his care, no fewer than a hundred and fifteen\r\nthousand eight hundred and eighty dead bodies, in the interval between\r\nthe fourteenth day of the month Xanthicus, [Nisan,] when the Romans\r\npitched their camp by the city, and the first day of the month Panemus\r\n[Tamuz]. This was itself a prodigious multitude; and though this man was\r\nnot himself set as a governor at that gate, yet was he appointed to pay\r\nthe public stipend for carrying these bodies out, and so was obliged of\r\nnecessity to number them, while the rest were buried by their relations;\r\nthough all their burial was but this, to bring them away, and cast them\r\nout of the city. After this man there ran away to Titus many of the\r\neminent citizens, and told him the entire number of the poor that were\r\ndead, and that no fewer than six hundred thousand were thrown out at the\r\ngates, though still the number of the rest could not be discovered; and\r\nthey told him further, that when they were no longer able to carry out\r\nthe dead bodies of the poor, they laid their corpses on heaps in very\r\nlarge houses, and shut them up therein; as also that a medimnus of wheat\r\nwas sold for a talent; and that when, a while afterward, it was not\r\npossible to gather herbs, by reason the city was all walled about, some\r\npersons were driven to that terrible distress as to search the common\r\nsewers and old dunghills of cattle, and to eat the dung which they got\r\nthere; and what they of old could not endure so much as to see they now\r\nused for food. When the Romans barely heard all this, they commiserated\r\ntheir case; while the seditious, who saw it also, did not repent,\r\nbut suffered the same distress to come upon themselves; for they were\r\nblinded by that fate which was already coming upon the city, and upon\r\nthemselves also.\r\n\r\nWAR BOOK 5 FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ This appears to be the first time that the zealots ventured\r\nto pollute this most sacred court of the temple, which was the court of\r\nthe priests, wherein the temple itself and the altar stood.

However, when\r\nCestius Gallus came first to the siege, that sum in Tacitus is no way\r\ndisagreeable to Josephus's history, though they were become much more\r\nnumerous when Titus encompassed the city at the passover. As to the\r\nnumber that perished during this siege, Josephus assures us, as we\r\nshall see hereafter, they were 1,100,000, besides 97,000 captives. But\r\nTacitus's history of the last part of this siege is not now extant; so\r\nwe cannot compare his parallel numbers with those of Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 (return) [ Perhaps, says Dr. Hudson, here was that gate, called the\r\n\"Gate of the Corner,\" in 2 Chronicles 26:9.

All that is or can be true here\r\nis this, that when the court of the Gentiles was long afterward to be\r\nencompassed with cloisters, the southern foundation for these cloisters\r\nwas found not to be large or firm enough, and was raised, and that\r\nadditional foundation supported by great pillars and arches under\r\nground, which Josephus speaks of elsewhere, Antiq. B. XV. ch. 11. sect.\r\n3, and which Mr. Maundrel saw, and describes, p. 100, as extant under\r\nground at this day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13 (return) [ What Josephus seems here to mean is this: that these\r\npillars, supporting the cloisters in the second court, had their\r\nfoundations or lowest parts as deep as the floor of the first or lowest\r\ncourt; but that so far of those lowest parts as were equal to the\r\nelevation of the upper floor above the lowest were, and must be, hidden\r\non the inside by the ground or rock itself, on which that upper\r\ncourt was built; so that forty cubits visible below were reduced to\r\ntwenty-five visible above, and implies the difference of their heights\r\nto be fifteen cubits. The main difficulty lies here, how fourteen or\r\nfifteen steps should give an ascent of fifteen cubits, half a cubit\r\nseeming sufficient for a single step. Possibly there were fourteen or\r\nfifteen steps at the partition wall, and fourteen or fifteen more thence\r\ninto the court itself, which would bring the whole near to the just\r\nproportion.

Had\r\nJosephus written even his first edition of these books of the war in\r\npure Hebrew, or had the Jews then used the pure Hebrew at Jerusalem, the\r\nHebrew word for a son is so like that for a stone, ben and eben, that\r\nsuch a correction might have been more easily admitted. But Josephus\r\nwrote his former edition for the use of the Jews beyond Euphrates, and\r\nso in the Chaldee language, as he did this second edition in the Greek\r\nlanguage; and bar was the Chaldee word for son, instead of the Hebrew\r\nben, and was used not only in Chaldea, etc. but in Judea also, as the\r\nNew Testament informs us. Dio lets us know that the very Romans at Rome\r\npronounced the name of Simon the son of Giora, Bar Poras for Bar Gioras,\r\nas we learn from Xiphiline, p. 217. Reland takes notice, \"that many will\r\nhere look for a mystery, as though the meaning were, that the Son of God\r\ncame now to take vengeance on the sins of the Jewish nation;\" which is\r\nindeed the truth of the fact, but hardly what the Jews could now mean;\r\nunless possibly by way of derision of Christ's threatening so often\r\nmade, that he would come at the head of the Roman army for their\r\ndestruction. But even this interpretation has but a very small degree of\r\nprobability. If I were to make an emendation by mere conjecture, I would\r\nread instead of, though the likeness be not so great as in lo; because\r\nthat is the word used by Josephus just before, as has been already noted\r\non this very occasion, while, an arrow or dart, is only a poetical word,\r\nand never used by Josephus elsewhere, and is indeed no way suitable\r\nto the occasion, this engine not throwing arrows or darts, but great\r\nstones, at this time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ Josephus supposes, in this his admirable speech to the\r\nJews, that not Abraham only, but Pharaoh king of Egypt, prayed towards\r\na temple at Jerusalem, or towards Jerusalem itself, in which were Mount\r\nSion and Mount Moriah, on which the tabernacle and temple did afterwards\r\nstand; and this long before either the Jewish tabernacle or temple were\r\nbuilt.

Thus did the miseries of Jerusalem grow worse and worse every day,\r\nand the seditious were still more irritated by the calamities they were\r\nunder, even while the famine preyed upon themselves, after it had preyed\r\nupon the people. And indeed the multitude of carcasses that lay in\r\nheaps one upon another was a horrible sight, and produced a pestilential\r\nstench, which was a hinderance to those that would make sallies out of\r\nthe city, and fight the enemy: but as those were to go in battle-array,\r\nwho had been already used to ten thousand murders, and must tread upon\r\nthose dead bodies as they marched along, so were not they terrified,\r\nnor did they pity men as they marched over them; nor did they deem this\r\naffront offered to the deceased to be any ill omen to themselves; but\r\nas they had their right hands already polluted with the murders of their\r\nown countrymen, and in that condition ran out to fight with foreigners,\r\nthey seem to me to have cast a reproach upon God himself, as if he were\r\ntoo slow in punishing them; for the war was not now gone on with as if\r\nthey had any hope of victory; for they gloried after a brutish manner\r\nin that despair of deliverance they were already in. And now the\r\nRomans, although they were greatly distressed in getting together their\r\nmaterials, raised their banks in one and twenty days, after they had cut\r\ndown all the trees that were in the country that adjoined to the city,\r\nand that for ninety furlongs round about, as I have already related. And\r\ntruly the very view itself of the country was a melancholy thing; for\r\nthose places which were before adorned with trees and pleasant gardens\r\nwere now become a desolate country every way, and its trees were all cut\r\ndown: nor could any foreigner that had formerly seen Judea and the most\r\nbeautiful suburbs of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but lament\r\nand mourn sadly at so great a change: for the war had laid all the signs\r\nof beauty quite waste: nor if any one that had known the place before,\r\nhad come on a sudden to it now, would he have known it again; but\r\nthough he were at the city itself, yet would he have inquired for it\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\n2. And now the banks were finished, they afforded a foundation for fear\r\nboth to the Romans and to the Jews; for the Jews expected that the city\r\nwould be taken, unless they could burn those banks, as did the Romans\r\nexpect that, if these were once burnt down, they should never be able to\r\ntake it; for there was a mighty scarcity of materials, and the bodies\r\nof the soldiers began to fail with such hard labors, as did their souls\r\nfaint with so many instances of ill success; nay, the very calamities\r\nthemselves that were in the city proved a greater discouragement to the\r\nRomans than those within the city; for they found the fighting men of\r\nthe Jews to be not at all mollified among such their sore afflictions,\r\nwhile they had themselves perpetually less and less hopes of success,\r\nand their banks were forced to yield to the stratagems of the enemy,\r\ntheir engines to the firmness of their wall, and their closest fights\r\nto the boldness of their attack; and, what was their greatest\r\ndiscouragement of all, they found the Jews' courageous souls to be\r\nsuperior to the multitude of the miseries they were under, by their\r\nsedition, their famine, and the war itself; insomuch that they were\r\nready to imagine that the violence of their attacks was invincible,\r\nand that the alacrity they showed would not be discouraged by their\r\ncalamities; for what would not those be able to bear if they should be\r\nfortunate, who turned their very misfortunes to the improvement of their\r\nvalor! These considerations made the Romans to keep a stronger guard\r\nabout their banks than they formerly had done.\r\n\r\n3. But now John and his party took care for securing themselves\r\nafterward, even in case this wall should be thrown down, and fell to\r\ntheir work before the battering rams were brought against them. Yet did\r\nthey not compass what they endeavored to do, but as they were gone out\r\nwith their torches, they came back under great discouragement before\r\nthey came near to the banks; and the reasons were these: that, in the\r\nfirst place, their conduct did not seem to be unanimous, but they went\r\nout in distinct parties, and at distinct intervals, and after a slow\r\nmanner, and timorously, and, to say all in a word, without a Jewish\r\ncourage; for they were now defective in what is peculiar to our nation,\r\nthat is, in boldness, in violence of assault, and in running upon the\r\nenemy all together, and in persevering in what they go about, though\r\nthey do not at first succeed in it; but they now went out in a more\r\nlanguid manner than usual, and at the same time found the Romans set in\r\narray, and more courageous than ordinary, and that they guarded their\r\nbanks both with their bodies and their entire armor, and this to such\r\na degree on all sides, that they left no room for the fire to get among\r\nthem, and that every one of their souls was in such good courage, that\r\nthey would sooner die than desert their ranks; for besides their notion\r\nthat all their hopes were cut off, in case these their works were once\r\nburnt, the soldiers were greatly ashamed that subtlety should quite be\r\ntoo hard for courage, madness for armor, multitude for skill, and Jews\r\nfor Romans. The Romans had now also another advantage, in that their\r\nengines for sieges co-operated with them in throwing darts and stones as\r\nfar as the Jews, when they were coming out of the city; whereby the man\r\nthat fell became an impediment to him that was next to him, as did the\r\ndanger of going farther make them less zealous in their attempts; and\r\nfor those that had run under the darts, some of them were terrified by\r\nthe good order and closeness of the enemies' ranks before they came to a\r\nclose fight, and others were pricked with their spears, and turned back\r\nagain; at length they reproached one another for their cowardice, and\r\nretired without doing any thing. This attack was made upon the first\r\nday of the month Panemus [Tamuz.] So when the Jews were retreated, the\r\nRomans brought their engines, although they had all the while stones\r\nthrown at them from the tower of Antonia, and were assaulted by fire and\r\nsword, and by all sorts of darts, which necessity afforded the Jews to\r\nmake use of; for although these had great dependence on their own wall,\r\nand a contempt of the Roman engines, yet did they endeavor to hinder\r\nthe Romans from bringing them. Now these Romans struggled hard, on the\r\ncontrary, to bring them, as deeming that this zeal of the Jews was\r\nin order to avoid any impression to be made on the tower of Antonia,\r\nbecause its wall was but weak, and its foundations rotten. However, that\r\ntower did not yield to the blows given it from the engines; yet did\r\nthe Romans bear the impressions made by the enemies' darts which were\r\nperpetually cast at them, and did not give way to any of those dangers\r\nthat came upon them from above, and so they brought their engines to\r\nbear. But then, as they were beneath the other, and were sadly wounded\r\nby the stones thrown down upon them, some of them threw their shields\r\nover their bodies, and partly with their hands, and partly with their\r\nbodies, and partly with crows, they undermined its foundations, and with\r\ngreat pains they removed four of its stones. Then night came upon both\r\nsides, and put an end to this struggle for the present; however, that\r\nnight the wall was so shaken by the battering rams in that place where\r\nJohn had used his stratagem before, and had undermined their banks, that\r\nthe ground then gave way, and the wall fell down suddenly.\r\n\r\n4. When this accident had unexpectedly happened, the minds of both\r\nparties were variously affected; for though one would expect that\r\nthe Jews would be discouraged, because this fall of their wall was\r\nunexpected by them, and they had made no provision in that case, yet\r\ndid they pull up their courage, because the tower of Antonia itself was\r\nstill standing; as was the unexpected joy of the Romans at this fall of\r\nthe wall soon quenched by the sight they had of another wall, which John\r\nand his party had built within it. However, the attack of this second\r\nwall appeared to be easier than that of the former, because it seemed\r\na thing of greater facility to get up to it through the parts of the\r\nformer wall that were now thrown down. This new wall appeared also to\r\nbe much weaker than the tower of Antonia, and accordingly the Romans\r\nimagined that it had been erected so much on the sudden, that they\r\nshould soon overthrow it: yet did not any body venture now to go up to\r\nthis wall; for that such as first ventured so to do must certainly be\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n5. And now Titus, upon consideration that the alacrity of soldiers in\r\nwar is chiefly excited by hopes and by good words, and that exhortations\r\nand promises do frequently make men to forget the hazards they run, nay,\r\nsometimes to despise death itself, got together the most courageous part\r\nof his army, and tried what he could do with his men by these methods.\r\n\"O fellow soldiers,\" said he, \"to make an exhortation to men to do what\r\nhath no peril in it, is on that very account inglorious to such to whom\r\nthat exhortation is made; and indeed so it is in him that makes the\r\nexhortation, an argument of his own cowardice also. I therefore think\r\nthat such exhortations ought then only to be made use of when affairs\r\nare in a dangerous condition, and yet are worthy of being attempted by\r\nevery one themselves; accordingly, I am fully of the same opinion with\r\nyou, that it is a difficult task to go up this wall; but that it is\r\nproper for those that desire reputation for their valor to struggle with\r\ndifficulties in such cases as will then appear, when I have particularly\r\nshown that it is a brave thing to die with glory, and that the courage\r\nhere necessary shall not go unrewarded in those that first begin the\r\nattempt. And let my first argument to move you to it be taken from\r\nwhat probably some would think reasonable to dissuade you, I mean the\r\nconstancy and patience of these Jews, even under their ill successes;\r\nfor it is unbecoming you, who are Romans and my soldiers, who have\r\nin peace been taught how to make wars, and who have also been used to\r\nconquer in those wars, to be inferior to Jews, either in action of the\r\nhand, or in courage of the soul, and this especially when you are at the\r\nconclusion of your victory, and are assisted by God himself; for as to\r\nour misfortunes, they have been owing to the madness of the Jews, while\r\ntheir sufferings have been owing to your valor, and to the assistance\r\nGod hath afforded you; for as to the seditions they have been in, and\r\nthe famine they are under, and the siege they now endure, and the\r\nfall of their walls without our engines, what can they all be but\r\ndemonstrations of God's anger against them, and of his assistance\r\nafforded us? It will not therefore be proper for you, either to show\r\nyourselves inferior to those to whom you are really superior, or to\r\nbetray that Divine assistance which is afforded you. And, indeed, how\r\ncan it be esteemed otherwise than a base and unworthy thing, that while\r\nthe Jews, who need not be much ashamed if they be deserted, because they\r\nhave long learned to be slaves to others, do yet despise death, that\r\nthey may be so no longer; and do make sallies into the very midst of\r\nus frequently, not in hopes of conquering us, but merely for a\r\ndemonstration of their courage; we, who have gotten possession of almost\r\nall the world that belongs to either land or sea, to whom it will be a\r\ngreat shame if we do not conquer them, do not once undertake any attempt\r\nagainst our enemies wherein there is much danger, but sit still idle,\r\nwith such brave arms as we have, and only wait till the famine and\r\nfortune do our business themselves, and this when we have it in our\r\npower, with some small hazard, to gain all that we desire! For if we go\r\nup to this tower of Antonia, we gain the city; for if there should be\r\nany more occasion for fighting against those within the city, which I do\r\nnot suppose there will, since we shall then be upon the top of the\r\nhill 1 and be upon our enemies before they can have taken breath, these\r\nadvantages promise us no less than a certain and sudden victory. As for\r\nmyself, I shall at present wave any commendation of those who die in\r\nwar, 2 and omit to speak of the immortality of those men who are slain\r\nin the midst of their martial bravery; yet cannot I forbear to imprecate\r\nupon those who are of a contrary disposition, that they may die in time\r\nof peace, by some distemper or other, since their souls are condemned to\r\nthe grave, together with their bodies. For what man of virtue is there\r\nwho does not know, that those souls which are severed from their fleshly\r\nbodies in battles by the sword are received by the ether, that purest of\r\nelements, and joined to that company which are placed among the stars;\r\nthat they become good demons, and propitious heroes, and show themselves\r\nas such to their posterity afterwards? while upon those souls that wear\r\naway in and with their distempered bodies comes a subterranean night\r\nto dissolve them to nothing, and a deep oblivion to take away all the\r\nremembrance of them, and this notwithstanding they be clean from all\r\nspots and defilements of this world; so that, in this ease, the soul at\r\nthe same time comes to the utmost bounds of its life, and of its body,\r\nand of its memorial also. But since he hath determined that death is to\r\ncome of necessity upon all men, a sword is a better instrument for that\r\npurpose than any disease whatsoever. Why is it not then a very mean\r\nthing for us not to yield up that to the public benefit which we must\r\nyield up to fate? And this discourse have I made, upon the supposition\r\nthat those who at first attempt to go upon this wall must needs be\r\nkilled in the attempt, though still men of true courage have a chance to\r\nescape even in the most hazardous undertakings. For, in the first\r\nplace, that part of the former wall that is thrown down is easily to be\r\nascended; and for the new-built wall, it is easily destroyed. Do you,\r\ntherefore, many of you, pull up your courage, and set about this work,\r\nand do you mutually encourage and assist one another; and this your\r\nbravery will soon break the hearts of your enemies; and perhaps such a\r\nglorious undertaking as yours is may be accomplished without bloodshed.\r\nFor although it be justly to be supposed that the Jews will try to\r\nhinder you at your first beginning to go up to them; yet when you have\r\nonce concealed yourselves from them, and driven them away by force, they\r\nwill not be able to sustain your efforts against them any longer, though\r\nbut a few of you prevent them, and get over the wall. As for that person\r\nwho first mounts the wall, I should blush for shame if I did not make\r\nhim to be envied of others, by those rewards I would bestow upon him.\r\nIf such a one escape with his life, he shall have the command of others\r\nthat are now but his equals; although it be true also that the greatest\r\nrewards will accrue to such as die in the attempt.\" 3\r\n\r\n6. Upon this speech of Titus, the rest of the multitude were afrighted\r\nat so great a danger. But there was one, whose name was Sabinus, a\r\nsoldier that served among the cohorts, and a Syrian by birth, who\r\nappeared to be of very great fortitude, both in the actions he had done,\r\nand the courage of his soul he had shown; although any body would\r\nhave thought, before he came to his work, that he was of such a weak\r\nconstitution of body, that he was not fit to be a soldier; for his color\r\nwas black, his flesh was lean and thin, and lay close together; but\r\nthere was a certain heroic soul that dwelt in this small body, which\r\nbody was indeed much too narrow for that peculiar courage which was in\r\nhim. Accordingly he was the first that rose up, when he thus spake: \"I\r\nreadily surrender up myself to thee, O Caesar; I first ascend the\r\nwall, and I heartily wish that my fortune may follow my courage and\r\nmy resolution And if some ill fortune grudge me the success of my\r\nundertaking, take notice that my ill success will not be unexpected, but\r\nthat I choose death voluntarily for thy sake.\" When he had said this,\r\nand had spread out his shield over his head with his left hand, and had,\r\nwith his right hand, drawn his sword, he marched up to the wall, just\r\nabout the sixth hour of the day. There followed him eleven others, and\r\nno more, that resolved to imitate his bravery; but still this was the\r\nprincipal person of them all, and went first, as excited by a divine\r\nfury. Now those that guarded the wall shot at them from thence, and cast\r\ninnumerable darts upon them from every side; they also rolled very large\r\nstones upon them, which overthrew some of those eleven that were with\r\nhim. But as for Sabinus himself, he met the darts that were cast at him\r\nand though he was overwhelmed with them, yet did he not leave off the\r\nviolence of his attack before he had gotten up on the top of the wall,\r\nand had put the enemy to flight. For as the Jews were astonished at\r\nhis great strength, and the bravery of his soul, and as, withal, they\r\nimagined more of them had got upon the wall than really had, they were\r\nput to flight. And now one cannot but complain here of fortune, as still\r\nenvious at virtue, and always hindering the performance of glorious\r\nachievements: this was the case of the man before us, when he had just\r\nobtained his purpose; for he then stumbled at a certain large stone, and\r\nfell down upon it headlong, with a very great noise. Upon which the Jews\r\nturned back, and when they saw him to be alone, and fallen down also,\r\nthey threw darts at him from every side. However, he got upon his knee,\r\nand covered himself with his shield, and at the first defended himself\r\nagainst them, and wounded many of those that came near him; but he was\r\nsoon forced to relax his right hand, by the multitude of the wounds that\r\nhad been given him, till at length he was quite covered over with darts\r\nbefore he gave up the ghost. He was one who deserved a better fate, by\r\nreason of his bravery; but, as might be expected, he fell under so vast\r\nan attempt. As for the rest of his partners, the Jews dashed three of\r\nthem to pieces with stones, and slew them as they were gotten up to the\r\ntop of the wall; the other eight being wounded, were pulled down, and\r\ncarried back to the camp. These things were done upon the third day of\r\nthe month Panemus [Tamuz].\r\n\r\n7. Now two days afterward twelve of those men that were on the\r\nforefront, and kept watch upon the banks, got together, and called to\r\nthem the standard-bearer of the fifth legion, and two others of a troop\r\nof horsemen, and one trumpeter; these went without noise, about the\r\nninth hour of the night, through the ruins, to the tower of Antonia; and\r\nwhen they had cut the throats of the first guards of the place, as they\r\nwere asleep, they got possession of the wall, and ordered the trumpeter\r\nto sound his trumpet. Upon which the rest of the guard got up on the\r\nsudden, and ran away, before any body could see how many they were that\r\nwere gotten up; for, partly from the fear they were in, and partly from\r\nthe sound of the trumpet which they heard, they imagined a great number\r\nof the enemy were gotten up. But as soon as Caesar heard the signal,\r\nhe ordered the army to put on their armor immediately, and came thither\r\nwith his commanders, and first of all ascended, as did the chosen men\r\nthat were with him. And as the Jews were flying away to the temple, they\r\nfell into that mine which John had dug under the Roman banks. Then\r\ndid the seditious of both the bodies of the Jewish army, as well that\r\nbelonging to John as that belonging to Simon, drive them away; and\r\nindeed were no way wanting as to the highest degree of force and\r\nalacrity; for they esteemed themselves entirely ruined if once the\r\nRomans got into the temple, as did the Romans look upon the same thing\r\nas the beginning of their entire conquest. So a terrible battle was\r\nfought at the entrance of the temple, while the Romans were forcing\r\ntheir way, in order to get possession of that temple, and the Jews were\r\ndriving them back to the tower of Antonia; in which battle the darts\r\nwere on both sides useless, as well as the spears, and both sides drew\r\ntheir swords, and fought it out hand to hand. Now during this struggle\r\nthe positions of the men were undistinguished on both sides, and\r\nthey fought at random, the men being intermixed one with another, and\r\nconfounded, by reason of the narrowness of the place; while the noise\r\nthat was made fell on the ear after an indistinct manner, because it\r\nwas so very loud. Great slaughter was now made on both sides, and the\r\ncombatants trod upon the bodies and the armor of those that were dead,\r\nand dashed them to pieces. Accordingly, to which side soever the battle\r\ninclined, those that had the advantage exhorted one another to go on, as\r\ndid those that were beaten make great lamentation. But still there was\r\nno room for flight, nor for pursuit, but disorderly revolutions and\r\nretreats, while the armies were intermixed one with another; but those\r\nthat were in the first ranks were under the necessity of killing or\r\nbeing killed, without any way for escaping; for those on both sides that\r\ncame behind forced those before them to go on, without leaving any space\r\nbetween the armies. At length the Jews' violent zeal was too hard for\r\nthe Romans' skill, and the battle already inclined entirely that way;\r\nfor the fight had lasted from the ninth hour of the night till the\r\nseventh hour of the day, While the Jews came on in crowds, and had the\r\ndanger the temple was in for their motive; the Romans having no more\r\nhere than a part of their army; for those legions, on which the soldiers\r\non that side depended, were not come up to them. So it was at present\r\nthought sufficient by the Romans to take possession of the tower of\r\nAntonia.\r\n\r\n8. But there was one Julian, a centurion, that came from Bithynia, a man\r\nhe was of great reputation, whom I had formerly seen in that war, and\r\none of the highest fame, both for his skill in war, his strength of\r\nbody, and the courage of his soul. This man, seeing the Romans giving\r\nground, and in a sad condition, [for he stood by Titus at the tower of\r\nAntonia,] leaped out, and of himself alone put the Jews to flight, when\r\nthey were already conquerors, and made them retire as far as the corner\r\nof the inner court of the temple; from him the multitude fled away in\r\ncrowds, as supposing that neither his strength nor his violent attacks\r\ncould be those of a mere man. Accordingly, he rushed through the midst\r\nof the Jews, as they were dispersed all abroad, and killed those that he\r\ncaught. Nor, indeed, was there any sight that appeared more wonderful in\r\nthe eyes of Caesar, or more terrible to others, than this. However, he\r\nwas himself pursued by fate, which it was not possible that he, who was\r\nbut a mortal man, should escape; for as he had shoes all full of thick\r\nand sharp nails 4 as had every one of the other soldiers, so when he ran\r\non the pavement of the temple, he slipped, and fell down upon his back\r\nwith a very great noise, which was made by his armor. This made those\r\nthat were running away to turn back; whereupon those Romans that were in\r\nthe tower of Antonia set up a great shout, as they were in fear for the\r\nman. But the Jews got about him in crowds, and struck at him with their\r\nspears and with their swords on all sides. Now he received a great\r\nmany of the strokes of these iron weapons upon his shield, and often\r\nattempted to get up again, but was thrown down by those that struck at\r\nhim; yet did he, as he lay along, stab many of them with his sword. Nor\r\nwas he soon killed, as being covered with his helmet and his breastplate\r\nin all those parts of his body where he might be mortally wounded; he\r\nalso pulled his neck close to his body, till all his other limbs were\r\nshattered, and nobody durst come to defend him, and then he yielded to\r\nhis fate. Now Caesar was deeply affected on account of this man of so\r\ngreat fortitude, and especially as he was killed in the sight of so many\r\npeople; he was desirous himself to come to his assistance, but the place\r\nwould not give him leave, while such as could have done it were too much\r\nterrified to attempt it. Thus when Julian had struggled with death a\r\ngreat while, and had let but few of those that had given him his mortal\r\nwound go off unhurt, he had at last his throat cut, though not without\r\nsome difficulty, and left behind him a very great fame, not only among\r\nthe Romans, and with Caesar himself, but among his enemies also; then\r\ndid the Jews catch up his dead body, and put the Romans to flight again,\r\nand shut them up in the tower of Antonia. Now those that most signalized\r\nthemselves, and fought most zealously in this battle of the Jewish side,\r\nwere one Alexas and Gyphtheus, of John's party, and of Simon's party\r\nwere Malachias, and Judas the son of Merto, and James the son of Sosas,\r\nthe commander of the Idumeans; and of the zealots, two brethren, Simon\r\nand Judas, the sons of Jairus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Titus Gave Orders To Demolish The Tower Of Antonia And\r\n     Then Persuaded Josephus To Exhort The Jews Again [To A\r\n     Surrender].\r\n\r\n1. And now Titus gave orders to his soldiers that were with him to dig\r\nup the foundations of the tower of Antonia, and make him a ready passage\r\nfor his army to come up; while he himself had Josephus brought to\r\nhim, [for he had been informed that on that very day, which was the\r\nseventeenth day 5of Panemus, [Tamuz,] the sacrifice called \"the Daily\r\nSacrifice\" had failed, and had not been offered to God, for want of men\r\nto offer it, and that the people were grievously troubled at it,] and\r\ncommanded him to say the same things to John that he had said before,\r\nthat if he had any malicious inclination for fighting, he might come out\r\nwith as many of his men as he pleased, in order to fight, without the\r\ndanger of destroying either his city or temple; but that he desired he\r\nwould not defile the temple, nor thereby offend against God. That he\r\nmight, if he pleased, offer the sacrifices which were now discontinued\r\nby any of the Jews whom he should pitch upon. Upon this Josephus stood\r\nin such a place where he might be heard, not by John only, but by many\r\nmore, and then declared to them what Caesar had given him in charge,\r\nand this in the Hebrew language. 6 So he earnestly prayed them to spare\r\ntheir own city, and to prevent that fire which was just ready to seize\r\nupon the temple, and to offer their usual sacrifices to God therein. At\r\nthese words of his a great sadness and silence were observed among the\r\npeople. But the tyrant himself cast many reproaches upon Josephus, with\r\nimprecations besides; and at last added this withal, that he did never\r\nfear the taking of the city, because it was God's own city. In answer to\r\nwhich Josephus said thus with a loud voice: \"To be sure thou hast kept\r\nthis city wonderfully pure for God's sake; the temple also continues\r\nentirely unpolluted! Nor hast thou been guilty of any impiety against\r\nhim for whose assistance thou hopest! He still receives his accustomed\r\nsacrifices! Vile wretch that thou art! if any one should deprive thee of\r\nthy daily food, thou wouldst esteem him to be an enemy to thee; but thou\r\nhopest to have that God for thy supporter in this war whom thou hast\r\ndeprived of his everlasting worship; and thou imputest those sins to the\r\nRomans, who to this very time take care to have our laws observed, and\r\nalmost compel these sacrifices to be still offered to God, which have\r\nby thy means been intermitted! Who is there that can avoid groans and\r\nlamentations at the amazing change that is made in this city? since\r\nvery foreigners and enemies do now correct that impiety which thou hast\r\noccasioned; while thou, who art a Jew, and wast educated in our laws,\r\nart become a greater enemy to them than the others. But still, John, it\r\nis never dishonorable to repent, and amend what hath been done amiss,\r\neven at the last extremity. Thou hast an instance before thee in\r\nJechoniah, 7 the king of the Jews, if thou hast a mind to save the\r\ncity, who, when the king of Babylon made war against him, did of his\r\nown accord go out of this city before it was taken, and did undergo a\r\nvoluntary captivity with his family, that the sanctuary might not be\r\ndelivered up to the enemy, and that he might not see the house of God\r\nset on fire; on which account he is celebrated among all the Jews, in\r\ntheir sacred memorials, and his memory is become immortal, and will be\r\nconveyed fresh down to our posterity through all ages. This, John, is\r\nan excellent example in such a time of danger, and I dare venture to\r\npromise that the Romans shall still forgive thee. And take notice that\r\nI, who make this exhortation to thee, am one of thine own nation; I,\r\nwho am a Jew, do make this promise to thee. And it will become thee to\r\nconsider who I am that give thee this counsel, and whence I am derived;\r\nfor while I am alive I shall never be in such slavery, as to forego\r\nmy own kindred, or forget the laws of our forefathers. Thou hast\r\nindignation at me again, and makest a clamor at me, and reproachest me;\r\nindeed I cannot deny but I am worthy of worse treatment than all this\r\namounts to, because, in opposition to fate, I make this kind invitation\r\nto thee, and endeavor to force deliverance upon those whom God hath\r\ncondemned. And who is there that does not know what the writings of the\r\nancient prophets contain in them,--and particularly that oracle which\r\nis just now going to be fulfilled upon this miserable city? For they\r\nforetold that this city should be then taken when somebody shall begin\r\nthe slaughter of his own countrymen. And are not both the city and the\r\nentire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen? It is God,\r\ntherefore, it is God himself who is bringing on this fire, to purge that\r\ncity and temple by means of the Romans, 8 and is going to pluck up this\r\ncity, which is full of your pollutions.\"\r\n\r\n2. As Josephus spoke these words, with groans and tears in his eyes, his\r\nvoice was intercepted by sobs. However, the Romans could not but pity\r\nthe affliction he was under, and wonder at his conduct. But for John,\r\nand those that were with him, they were but the more exasperated against\r\nthe Romans on this account, and were desirous to get Josephus also into\r\ntheir power: yet did that discourse influence a great many of the better\r\nsort; and truly some of them were so afraid of the guards set by the\r\nseditious, that they tarried where they were, but still were satisfied\r\nthat both they and the city were doomed to destruction. Some also there\r\nwere who, watching a proper opportunity when they might quietly get\r\naway, fled to the Romans, of whom were the high priests Joseph and\r\nJesus, and of the sons of high priests three, whose father was Ishmael,\r\nwho was beheaded in Cyrene, and four sons of Matthias, as also one son\r\nof the other Matthias, who ran away after his father's death, 9 and\r\nwhose father was slain by Simon the son of Gioras, with three of his\r\nsons, as I have already related; many also of the other nobility went\r\nover to the Romans, together with the high priests. Now Caesar not only\r\nreceived these men very kindly in other respects, but, knowing they\r\nwould not willingly live after the customs of other nations, he sent\r\nthem to Gophna, and desired them to remain there for the present, and\r\ntold them, that when he was gotten clear of this war, he would restore\r\neach of them to their possessions again; so they cheerfully retired to\r\nthat small city which was allotted them, without fear of any danger.\r\nBut as they did not appear, the seditious gave out again that these\r\ndeserters were slain by the Romans, which was done in order to deter\r\nthe rest from running away, by fear of the like treatment. This trick of\r\ntheirs succeeded now for a while, as did the like trick before; for the\r\nrest were hereby deterred from deserting, by fear of the like treatment.\r\n\r\n3. However, when Titus had recalled those men from Gophna, he gave\r\norders that they should go round the wall, together with Josephus,\r\nand show themselves to the people; upon which a great many fled to the\r\nRomans. These men also got in a great number together, and stood before\r\nthe Romans, and besought the seditious, with groans and tears in their\r\neyes, in the first place to receive the Romans entirely into the city,\r\nand save that their own place of residence again; but that, if they\r\nwould not agree to such a proposal, they would at least depart out of\r\nthe temple, and save the holy house for their own use; for that the\r\nRomans would not venture to set the sanctuary on fire but under the most\r\npressing necessity. Yet did the seditious still more and more contradict\r\nthem; and while they cast loud and bitter reproaches upon these\r\ndeserters, they also set their engines for throwing of darts, and\r\njavelins, and stones upon the sacred gates of the temple, at due\r\ndistances from one another, insomuch that all the space round about\r\nwithin the temple might be compared to a burying-ground, so great was\r\nthe number of the dead bodies therein; as might the holy house itself\r\nbe compared to a citadel. Accordingly, these men rushed upon these holy\r\nplaces in their armor, that were otherwise unapproachable, and that\r\nwhile their hands were yet warm with the blood of their own people which\r\nthey had shed; nay, they proceeded to such great transgressions, that\r\nthe very same indignation which Jews would naturally have against\r\nRomans, had they been guilty of such abuses against them, the Romans\r\nnow had against Jews, for their impiety in regard to their own religious\r\ncustoms. Nay, indeed, there were none of the Roman soldiers who did not\r\nlook with a sacred horror upon the holy house, and adored it, and wished\r\nthat the robbers would repent before their miseries became incurable.\r\n\r\n4. Now Titus was deeply affected with this state of things, and\r\nreproached John and his party, and said to them, \"Have not you, vile\r\nwretches that you are, by our permission, put up this partition-wall\r\nbefore your sanctuary? Have not you been allowed to put up the pillars\r\nthereto belonging, at due distances, and on it to engrave in Greek,\r\nand in your own letters, this prohibition, that no foreigner should\r\ngo beyond that wall. 10 Have not we given you leave to kill such as\r\ngo beyond it, though he were a Roman? And what do you do now, you\r\npernicious villains? Why do you trample upon dead bodies in this temple?\r\nand why do you pollute this holy house with the blood of both foreigners\r\nand Jews themselves? I appeal to the gods of my own country, and to\r\nevery god that ever had any regard to this place; [for I do not suppose\r\nit to be now regarded by any of them;] I also appeal to my own army, and\r\nto those Jews that are now with me, and even to yourselves, that I do\r\nnot force you to defile this your sanctuary; and if you will but change\r\nthe place whereon you will fight, no Roman shall either come near your\r\nsanctuary, or offer any affront to it; nay, I will endeavor to preserve\r\nyou your holy house, whether you will or not.\" 11\r\n\r\n5. As Josephus explained these things from the mouth of Caesar, both the\r\nrobbers and the tyrant thought that these exhortations proceeded from\r\nTitus's fear, and not from his good-will to them, and grew insolent\r\nupon it. But when Titus saw that these men were neither to be moved by\r\ncommiseration towards themselves, nor had any concern upon them to have\r\nthe holy house spared, he proceeded unwillingly to go on again with the\r\nwar against them. He could not indeed bring all his army against them,\r\nthe place was so narrow; but choosing thirty soldiers of the most\r\nvaliant out of every hundred, and committing a thousand to each tribune,\r\nand making Cerealis their commander-in-chief, he gave orders that they\r\nshould attack the guards of the temple about the ninth hour of that\r\nnight. But as he was now in his armor, and preparing to go down with\r\nthem, his friends would not let him go, by reason of the greatness of\r\nthe danger, and what the commanders suggested to them; for they said\r\nthat he would do more by sitting above in the tower of Antonia, as a\r\ndispenser of rewards to those soldiers that signalized themselves in the\r\nfight, than by coming down and hazarding his own person in the forefront\r\nof them; for that they would all fight stoutly while Caesar looked upon\r\nthem. With this advice Caesar complied, and said that the only reason\r\nhe had for such compliance with the soldiers was this, that he might be\r\nable to judge of their courageous actions, and that no valiant soldier\r\nmight lie concealed, and miss of his reward, and no cowardly soldier\r\nmight go unpunished; but that he might himself be an eye-witness, and\r\nable to give evidence of all that was done, who was to be the disposer\r\nof punishments and rewards to them. So he sent the soldiers about their\r\nwork at the hour forementioned, while he went out himself to a higher\r\nplace in the tower of Antonia, whence he might see what was done, and\r\nthere waited with impatience to see the event.\r\n\r\n6. However, the soldiers that were sent did not find the guards of the\r\ntemple asleep, as they hoped to have done; but were obliged to fight\r\nwith them immediately hand to hand, as they rushed with violence upon\r\nthem with a great shout. Now as soon as the rest within the temple heard\r\nthat shout of those that were upon the watch, they ran out in troops\r\nupon them. Then did the Romans receive the onset of those that came\r\nfirst upon them; but those that followed them fell upon their own\r\ntroops, and many of them treated their own soldiers as if they had\r\nbeen enemies; for the great confused noise that was made on both sides\r\nhindered them from distinguishing one another's voices, as did the\r\ndarkness of the night hinder them from the like distinction by the\r\nsight, besides that blindness which arose otherwise also from the\r\npassion and the fear they were in at the same time; for which reason\r\nit was all one to the soldiers who it was they struck at. However, this\r\nignorance did less harm to the Romans than to the Jews, because they\r\nwere joined together under their shields, and made their sallies\r\nmore regularly than the others did, and each of them remembered their\r\nwatch-word; while the Jews were perpetually dispersed abroad, and made\r\ntheir attacks and retreats at random, and so did frequently seem to one\r\nanother to be enemies; for every one of them received those of their own\r\nmen that came back in the dark as Romans, and made an assault upon them;\r\nso that more of them were wounded by their own men than by the enemy,\r\ntill, upon the coming on of the day, the nature of the right was\r\ndiscerned by the eye afterward. Then did they stand in battle-array in\r\ndistinct bodies, and cast their darts regularly, and regularly defended\r\nthemselves; nor did either side yield or grow weary. The Romans\r\ncontended with each other who should fight the most strenuously, both\r\nsingle men and entire regiments, as being under the eye of Titus; and\r\nevery one concluded that this day would begin his promotion if he\r\nfought bravely. What were the great encouragements of the Jews to act\r\nvigorously were, their fear for themselves and for the temple, and the\r\npresence of their tyrant, who exhorted some, and beat and threatened\r\nothers, to act courageously. Now, it so happened, that this fight was\r\nfor the most part a stationary one, wherein the soldiers went on and\r\ncame back in a short time, and suddenly; for there was no long space of\r\nground for either of their flights or pursuits. But still there was a\r\ntumultuous noise among the Romans from the tower of Antonia, who loudly\r\ncried out upon all occasions to their own men to press on courageously,\r\nwhen they were too hard for the Jews, and to stay when they were\r\nretiring backward; so that here was a kind of theater of war; for what\r\nwas done in this fight could not be concealed either from Titus, or from\r\nthose that were about him. At length it appeared that this fight, which\r\nbegan at the ninth hour of the night, was not over till past the fifth\r\nhour of the day; and that, in the same place where the battle began,\r\nneither party could say they had made the other to retire; but both\r\nthe armies left the victory almost in uncertainty between them; wherein\r\nthose that signalized themselves on the Roman side were a great many,\r\nbut on the Jewish side, and of those that were with Simon, Judas the son\r\nof Merto, and Simon the son of Josas; of the Idumeans, James and Simon,\r\nthe latter of whom was the son of Cathlas, and James was the son of\r\nSosas; of those that were with John, Gyphtheus and Alexas; and of the\r\nzealots, Simon the son of Jairus.\r\n\r\n7. In the mean time, the rest of the Roman army had, in seven days'\r\ntime, overthrown [some] foundations of the tower of Antonia, and had\r\nmade a ready and broad way to the temple. Then did the legions come near\r\nthe first court, 12 and began to raise their banks. The one bank was\r\nover against the north-west corner of the inner temple 13 another was at\r\nthat northern edifice which was between the two gates; and of the other\r\ntwo, one was at the western cloister of the outer court of the temple;\r\nthe other against its northern cloister. However, these works were thus\r\nfar advanced by the Romans, not without great pains and difficulty, and\r\nparticularly by being obliged to bring their materials from the distance\r\nof a hundred furlongs. They had further difficulties also upon them;\r\nsometimes by their over-great security they were in that they should\r\novercome the Jewish snares laid for them, and by that boldness of the\r\nJews which their despair of escaping had inspired them withal; for some\r\nof their horsemen, when they went out to gather wood or hay, let their\r\nhorses feed without having their bridles on during the time of foraging;\r\nupon which horses the Jews sallied out in whole bodies, and seized them.\r\nAnd when this was continually done, and Caesar believed what the truth\r\nwas, that the horses were stolen more by the negligence of his own men\r\nthan by the valor of the Jews, he determined to use greater severity to\r\noblige the rest to take care of their horses; so he commanded that\r\none of those soldiers who had lost their horses should be capitally\r\npunished; whereby he so terrified the rest, that they preserved their\r\nhorses for the time to come; for they did not any longer let them go\r\nfrom them to feed by themselves, but, as if they had grown to them, they\r\nwent always along with them when they wanted necessaries. Thus did the\r\nRomans still continue to make war against the temple, and to raise their\r\nbanks against it.\r\n\r\n8. Now after one day had been interposed since the Romans ascended the\r\nbreach, many of the seditious were so pressed by the famine, upon the\r\npresent failure of their ravages, that they got together, and made an\r\nattack on those Roman guards that were upon the Mount of Olives, and\r\nthis about the eleventh hour of the day, as supposing, first, that they\r\nwould not expect such an onset, and, in the next place, that they were\r\nthen taking care of their bodies, and that therefore they should easily\r\nbeat them. But the Romans were apprized of their coming to attack them\r\nbeforehand, and, running together from the neighboring camps on the\r\nsudden, prevented them from getting over their fortification, or forcing\r\nthe wall that was built about them. Upon this came on a sharp fight, and\r\nhere many great actions were performed on both sides; while the Romans\r\nshowed both their courage and their skill in war, as did the Jews come\r\non them with immoderate violence and intolerable passion. The one part\r\nwere urged on by shame, and the other by necessity; for it seemed a very\r\nshameful thing to the Romans to let the Jews go, now they were taken in\r\na kind of net; while the Jews had but one hope of saving themselves, and\r\nthat was in case they could by violence break through the Roman wall;\r\nand one whose name was Pedanius, belonging to a party of horsemen, when\r\nthe Jews were already beaten and forced down into the valley together,\r\nspurred his horse on their flank with great vehemence, and caught up a\r\ncertain young man belonging to the enemy by his ankle, as he was running\r\naway; the man was, however, of a robust body, and in his armor; so\r\nlow did Pedanius bend himself downward from his horse, even as he was\r\ngalloping away, and so great was the strength of his right hand, and of\r\nthe rest of his body, as also such skill had he in horsemanship. So this\r\nman seized upon that his prey, as upon a precious treasure, and carried\r\nhim as his captive to Caesar; whereupon Titus admired the man that had\r\nseized the other for his great strength, and ordered the man that was\r\ncaught to be punished [with death] for his attempt against the Roman\r\nwall, but betook himself to the siege of the temple, and to pressing on\r\nthe raising of the banks.\r\n\r\n9. In the mean time, the Jews were so distressed by the fights they had\r\nbeen in, as the war advanced higher and higher, and creeping up to the\r\nholy house itself, that they, as it were, cut off those limbs of their\r\nbody which were infected, in order to prevent the distemper's spreading\r\nfurther; for they set the north-west cloister, which was joined to the\r\ntower of Antonia, on fire, and after that brake off about twenty cubits\r\nof that cloister, and thereby made a beginning in burning the sanctuary;\r\ntwo days after which, or on the twenty-fourth day of the forenamed\r\nmonth, [Panemus or Tamuz,] the Romans set fire to the cloister that\r\njoined to the other, when the fire went fifteen cubits farther. The\r\nJews, in like manner, cut off its roof; nor did they entirely leave\r\noff what they were about till the tower of Antonia was parted from the\r\ntemple, even when it was in their power to have stopped the fire; nay,\r\nthey lay still while the temple was first set on fire, and deemed this\r\nspreading of the fire to be for their own advantage. However, the armies\r\nwere still fighting one against another about the temple, and the war\r\nwas managed by continual sallies of particular parties against one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n10. Now there was at this time a man among the Jews, low of stature he\r\nwas, and of a despicable appearance; of no character either as to his\r\nfamily, or in other respects: his name was Jonathan. He went out at the\r\nhigh priest John's monument, and uttered many other insolent things to\r\nthe Romans, and challenged the best of them all to a single combat. But\r\nmany of those that stood there in the army huffed him, and many of them\r\n[as they might well be] were afraid of him. Some of them also reasoned\r\nthus, and that justly enough: that it was not fit to fight with a man\r\nthat desired to die, because those that utterly despaired of deliverance\r\nhad, besides other passions, a violence in attacking men that could not\r\nbe opposed, and had no regard to God himself; and that to hazard oneself\r\nwith a person, whom, if you overcome, you do no great matter, and\r\nby whom it is hazardous that you may be taken prisoner, would be an\r\ninstance, not of manly courage, but of unmanly rashness. So there being\r\nnobody that came out to accept the man's challenge, and the Jew cutting\r\nthem with a great number of reproaches, as cowards, [for he was a very\r\nhaughty man in himself, and a great despiser of the Romans,] one whose\r\nname was Pudens, of the body of horsemen, out of his abomination of\r\nthe other's words, and of his impudence withal, and perhaps out of an\r\ninconsiderate arrogance, on account of the other's lowness of stature,\r\nran out to him, and was too hard for him in other respects, but was\r\nbetrayed by his ill fortune; for he fell down, and as he was down,\r\nJonathan came running to him, and cut his throat, and then, standing\r\nupon his dead body, he brandished his sword, bloody as it was, and shook\r\nhis shield with his left hand, and made many acclamations to the Roman\r\narmy, and exulted over the dead man, and jested upon the Romans; till\r\nat length one Priscus, a centurion, shot a dart at him as he was leaping\r\nand playing the fool with himself, and thereby pierced him through;\r\nupon which a shout was set up both by the Jews and the Romans, though\r\non different accounts. So Jonathan grew giddy by the pain of his wounds,\r\nand fell down upon the body of his adversary, as a plain instance how\r\nsuddenly vengeance may come upon men that have success in war, without\r\nany just deserving the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning A Stratagem That Was Devised By The Jews, By\r\n     Which They Burnt Many Of The Romans; With Another\r\n     Description Of The Terrible Famine That Was In The City.\r\n\r\n1. But now the seditious that were in the temple did every day openly\r\nendeavor to beat off the soldiers that were upon the banks, and on the\r\ntwenty-seventh day of the forenamed month [Panemus or Tamuz] contrived\r\nsuch a stratagem as this: They filled that part of the western cloister\r\n14 which was between the beams, and the roof under them, with dry\r\nmaterials, as also with bitumen and pitch, and then retired from that\r\nplace, as though they were tired with the pains they had taken; at which\r\nprocedure of theirs, many of the most inconsiderate among the Romans,\r\nwho were carried away with violent passions, followed hard after them as\r\nthey were retiring, and applied ladders to the cloister, and got up to\r\nit suddenly; but the prudent part of them, when they understood this\r\nunaccountable retreat of the Jews, stood still where they were before.\r\nHowever, the cloister was full of those that were gone up the ladders;\r\nat which time the Jews set it all on fire; and as the flame burst out\r\nevery where on the sudden, the Romans that were out of the danger were\r\nseized with a very great consternation, as were those that were in\r\nthe midst of the danger in the utmost distress. So when they perceived\r\nthemselves surrounded with the flames, some of them threw themselves\r\ndown backwards into the city, and some among their enemies [in the\r\ntemple]; as did many leap down to their own men, and broke their limbs\r\nto pieces; but a great number of those that were going to take these\r\nviolent methods were prevented by the fire; though some prevented the\r\nfire by their own swords. However, the fire was on the sudden carried\r\nso far as to surround those who would have otherwise perished. As for\r\nCaesar himself, he could not, however, but commiserate those that thus\r\nperished, although they got up thither without any order for so doing,\r\nsince there was no way of giving the many relief. Yet was this some\r\ncomfort to those that were destroyed, that every body might see that\r\nperson grieve, for whose sake they came to their end; for he cried out\r\nopenly to them, and leaped up, and exhorted those that were about him to\r\ndo their utmost to relieve them; So every one of them died cheerfully,\r\nas carrying along with him these words and this intention of Caesar as a\r\nsepulchral monument. Some there were indeed who retired into the wall of\r\nthe cloister, which was broad, and were preserved out of the fire, but\r\nwere then surrounded by the Jews; and although they made resistance\r\nagainst the Jews for a long time, yet were they wounded by them, and at\r\nlength they all fell down dead.\r\n\r\n2. At the last a young man among them, whose name was Longus, became a\r\ndecoration to this sad affair, and while every one of them that perished\r\nwere worthy of a memorial, this man appeared to deserve it beyond\r\nall the rest. Now the Jews admired this man for his courage, and were\r\nfurther desirous of having him slain; so they persuaded him to come down\r\nto them, upon security given him for his life. But Cornelius his brother\r\npersuaded him on the contrary, not to tarnish his own glory, nor that\r\nof the Roman army. He complied with this last advice, and lifting up his\r\nsword before both armies, he slew himself. Yet there was one Artorius\r\namong those surrounded by the fire who escaped by his subtlety; for\r\nwhen he had with a loud voice called to him Lucius, one of his fellow\r\nsoldiers that lay with him in the same tent, and said to him, \"I do\r\nleave thee heir of all I have, if thou wilt come and receive me.\" Upon\r\nthis he came running to receive him readily; Artorius then threw himself\r\ndown upon him, and saved his own life, while he that received him was\r\ndashed so vehemently against the stone pavement by the other's weight,\r\nthat he died immediately. This melancholy accident made the Romans\r\nsad for a while, but still it made them more upon their guard for the\r\nfuture, and was of advantage to them against the delusions of the Jews,\r\nby which they were greatly damaged through their unacquaintedness with\r\nthe places, and with the nature of the inhabitants. Now this cloister\r\nwas burnt down as far as John's tower, which he built in the war he made\r\nagainst Simon over the gates that led to the Xystus. The Jews also cut\r\noff the rest of that cloister from the temple, after they had destroyed\r\nthose that got up to it. But the next day the Romans burnt down the\r\nnorthern cloister entirely, as far as the east cloister, whose common\r\nangle joined to the valley that was called Cedron, and was built over\r\nit; on which account the depth was frightful. And this was the state of\r\nthe temple at that time.\r\n\r\n3. Now of those that perished by famine in the city, the number was\r\nprodigious, and the miseries they underwent were unspeakable; for if so\r\nmuch as the shadow of any kind of food did any where appear, a war was\r\ncommenced presently, and the dearest friends fell a fighting one with\r\nanother about it, snatching from each other the most miserable supports\r\nof life. Nor would men believe that those who were dying had no food,\r\nbut the robbers would search them when they were expiring, lest any one\r\nshould have concealed food in their bosoms, and counterfeited dying;\r\nnay, these robbers gaped for want, and ran about stumbling and\r\nstaggering along like mad dogs, and reeling against the doors of the\r\nhouses like drunken men; they would also, in the great distress they\r\nwere in, rush into the very same houses two or three times in one and\r\nthe same day. Moreover, their hunger was so intolerable, that it obliged\r\nthem to chew every thing, while they gathered such things as the most\r\nsordid animals would not touch, and endured to eat them; nor did they\r\nat length abstain from girdles and shoes; and the very leather which\r\nbelonged to their shields they pulled off and gnawed: the very wisps\r\nof old hay became food to some; and some gathered up fibres, and sold\r\na very small weight of them for four Attic [drachmae]. But why do I\r\ndescribe the shameless impudence that the famine brought on men in their\r\neating inanimate things, while I am going to relate a matter of fact,\r\nthe like to which no history relates, 15 either among the Greeks or\r\nBarbarians? It is horrible to speak of it, and incredible when heard.\r\nI had indeed willingly omitted this calamity of ours, that I might not\r\nseem to deliver what is so portentous to posterity, but that I have\r\ninnumerable witnesses to it in my own age; and besides, my country would\r\nhave had little reason to thank me for suppressing the miseries that she\r\nunderwent at this time.\r\n\r\n4. There was a certain woman that dwelt beyond Jordan, her name was\r\nMary; her father was Eleazar, of the village Bethezob, which signifies\r\nthe house of Hyssop. She was eminent for her family and her wealth, and\r\nhad fled away to Jerusalem with the rest of the multitude, and was with\r\nthem besieged therein at this time. The other effects of this woman had\r\nbeen already seized upon, such I mean as she had brought with her out\r\nof Perea, and removed to the city. What she had treasured up besides, as\r\nalso what food she had contrived to save, had been also carried off by\r\nthe rapacious guards, who came every day running into her house for that\r\npurpose. This put the poor woman into a very great passion, and by\r\nthe frequent reproaches and imprecations she cast at these rapacious\r\nvillains, she had provoked them to anger against her; but none of them,\r\neither out of the indignation she had raised against herself, or out of\r\ncommiseration of her case, would take away her life; and if she found\r\nany food, she perceived her labors were for others, and not for herself;\r\nand it was now become impossible for her any way to find any more food,\r\nwhile the famine pierced through her very bowels and marrow, when also\r\nher passion was fired to a degree beyond the famine itself; nor did she\r\nconsult with any thing but with her passion and the necessity she was\r\nin. She then attempted a most unnatural thing; and snatching up her\r\nson, who was a child sucking at her breast, she said, \"O thou miserable\r\ninfant! for whom shall I preserve thee in this war, this famine, and\r\nthis sedition? As to the war with the Romans, if they preserve our\r\nlives, we must be slaves. This famine also will destroy us, even before\r\nthat slavery comes upon us. Yet are these seditious rogues more terrible\r\nthan both the other. Come on; be thou my food, and be thou a fury to\r\nthese seditious varlets, and a by-word to the world, which is all that\r\nis now wanting to complete the calamities of us Jews.\" As soon as she\r\nhad said this, she slew her son, and then roasted him, and eat the one\r\nhalf of him, and kept the other half by her concealed. Upon this the\r\nseditious came in presently, and smelling the horrid scent of this food,\r\nthey threatened her that they would cut her throat immediately if she\r\ndid not show them what food she had gotten ready. She replied that she\r\nhad saved a very fine portion of it for them, and withal uncovered\r\nwhat was left of her son. Hereupon they were seized with a horror and\r\namazement of mind, and stood astonished at the sight, when she said to\r\nthem, \"This is mine own son, and what hath been done was mine own\r\ndoing! Come, eat of this food; for I have eaten of it myself! Do not\r\nyou pretend to be either more tender than a woman, or more compassionate\r\nthan a mother; but if you be so scrupulous, and do abominate this my\r\nsacrifice, as I have eaten the one half, let the rest be reserved for\r\nme also.\" After which those men went out trembling, being never so much\r\naffrighted at any thing as they were at this, and with some difficulty\r\nthey left the rest of that meat to the mother. Upon which the whole city\r\nwas full of this horrid action immediately; and while every body laid\r\nthis miserable case before their own eyes, they trembled, as if this\r\nunheard of action had been done by themselves. So those that were thus\r\ndistressed by the famine were very desirous to die, and those already\r\ndead were esteemed happy, because they had not lived long enough either\r\nto hear or to see such miseries.\r\n\r\n5. This sad instance was quickly told to the Romans, some of whom could\r\nnot believe it, and others pitied the distress which the Jews were\r\nunder; but there were many of them who were hereby induced to a more\r\nbitter hatred than ordinary against our nation. But for Caesar, he\r\nexcused himself before God as to this matter, and said that he had\r\nproposed peace and liberty to the Jews, as well as an oblivion of all\r\ntheir former insolent practices; but that they, instead of concord,\r\nhad chosen sedition; instead of peace, war; and before satiety and\r\nabundance, a famine. That they had begun with their own hands to burn\r\ndown that temple which we have preserved hitherto; and that therefore\r\nthey deserved to eat such food as this was. That, however, this horrid\r\naction of eating an own child ought to be covered with the overthrow of\r\ntheir very country itself, and men ought not to leave such a city upon\r\nthe habitable earth to be seen by the sun, wherein mothers are thus fed,\r\nalthough such food be fitter for the fathers than for the mothers to eat\r\nof, since it is they that continue still in a state of war against us,\r\nafter they have undergone such miseries as these. And at the same time\r\nthat he said this, he reflected on the desperate condition these men\r\nmust be in; nor could he expect that such men could be recovered to\r\nsobriety of mind, after they had endured those very sufferings, for the\r\navoiding whereof it only was probable they might have repented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     When The Banks Were Completed And The Battering Rams\r\n     Brought, And Could Do Nothing, Titus Gave Orders To Set Fire\r\n     To The Gates Of The Temple; In No Long Time After Which The\r\n     Holy House Itself Was Burnt Down, Even Against His Consent.\r\n\r\n1. And now two of the legions had completed their banks on the eighth\r\nday of the month Lous [Ab]. Whereupon Titus gave orders that the\r\nbattering rams should be brought, and set over against the western\r\nedifice of the inner temple; for before these were brought, the firmest\r\nof all the other engines had battered the wall for six days together\r\nwithout ceasing, without making any impression upon it; but the vast\r\nlargeness and strong connexion of the stones were superior to that\r\nengine, and to the other battering rams also. Other Romans did indeed\r\nundermine the foundations of the northern gate, and after a world of\r\npains removed the outermost stones, yet was the gate still upheld by the\r\ninner stones, and stood still unhurt; till the workmen, despairing of\r\nall such attempts by engines and crows, brought their ladders to the\r\ncloisters. Now the Jews did not interrupt them in so doing; but when\r\nthey were gotten up, they fell upon them, and fought with them; some of\r\nthem they thrust down, and threw them backwards headlong; others of\r\nthem they met and slew; they also beat many of those that went down the\r\nladders again, and slew them with their swords before they could bring\r\ntheir shields to protect them; nay, some of the ladders they threw down\r\nfrom above when they were full of armed men; a great slaughter was made\r\nof the Jews also at the same time, while those that bare the ensigns\r\nfought hard for them, as deeming it a terrible thing, and what would\r\ntend to their great shame, if they permitted them to be stolen away. Yet\r\ndid the Jews at length get possession of these engines, and destroyed\r\nthose that had gone up the ladders, while the rest were so intimidated\r\nby what those suffered who were slain, that they retired; although none\r\nof the Romans died without having done good service before his death. Of\r\nthe seditious, those that had fought bravely in the former battles did\r\nthe like now, as besides them did Eleazar, the brother's son of Simon\r\nthe tyrant. But when Titus perceived that his endeavors to spare a\r\nforeign temple turned to the damage of his soldiers, and then be killed,\r\nhe gave order to set the gates on fire.\r\n\r\n2. In the mean time, there deserted to him Ananus, who came from\r\nEmmaus, the most bloody of all Simon's guards, and Archelaus, the son of\r\nMagadatus, they hoping to be still forgiven, because they left the Jews\r\nat a time when they were the conquerors. Titus objected this to these\r\nmen, as a cunning trick of theirs; and as he had been informed of their\r\nother barbarities towards the Jews, he was going in all haste to\r\nhave them both slain. He told them that they were only driven to this\r\ndesertion because of the utmost distress they were in, and did not come\r\naway of their own good disposition; and that those did not deserve to be\r\npreserved, by whom their own city was already set on fire, out of which\r\nfire they now hurried themselves away. However, the security he had\r\npromised deserters overcame his resentments, and he dismissed them\r\naccordingly, though he did not give them the same privileges that he\r\nhad afforded to others. And now the soldiers had already put fire to the\r\ngates, and the silver that was over them quickly carried the flames to\r\nthe wood that was within it, whence it spread itself all on the sudden,\r\nand caught hold on the cloisters. Upon the Jews seeing this fire all\r\nabout them, their spirits sunk together with their bodies, and they were\r\nunder such astonishment, that not one of them made any haste, either to\r\ndefend himself or to quench the fire, but they stood as mute spectators\r\nof it only. However, they did not so grieve at the loss of what was now\r\nburning, as to grow wiser thereby for the time to come; but as though\r\nthe holy house itself had been on fire already, they whetted their\r\npassions against the Romans. This fire prevailed during that day and the\r\nnext also; for the soldiers were not able to burn all the cloisters that\r\nwere round about together at one time, but only by pieces.\r\n\r\n3. But then, on the next day, Titus commanded part of his army to\r\nquench the fire, and to make a road for the more easy marching up of\r\nthe legions, while he himself gathered the commanders together. Of those\r\nthere were assembled the six principal persons: Tiberius Alexander, the\r\ncommander [under the general] of the whole army; with Sextus Cerealis,\r\nthe commander of the fifth legion; and Larcius Lepidus, the commander\r\nof the tenth legion; and Titus Frigius, the commander of the fifteenth\r\nlegion: there was also with them Eternius, the leader of the two legions\r\nthat came from Alexandria; and Marcus Antonius Julianus, procurator of\r\nJudea: after these came together all the rest of the procurators and\r\ntribunes. Titus proposed to these that they should give him their advice\r\nwhat should be done about the holy house. Now some of these thought\r\nit would be the best way to act according to the rules of war, [and\r\ndemolish it,] because the Jews would never leave off rebelling while\r\nthat house was standing; at which house it was that they used to get all\r\ntogether. Others of them were of opinion, that in case the Jews would\r\nleave it, and none of them would lay their arms up in it, he might save\r\nit; but that in case they got upon it, and fought any more, he might\r\nburn it; because it must then be looked upon not as a holy house, but as\r\na citadel; and that the impiety of burning it would then belong to\r\nthose that forced this to be done, and not to them. But Titus said, that\r\n\"although the Jews should get upon that holy house, and fight us thence,\r\nyet ought we not to revenge ourselves on things that are inanimate,\r\ninstead of the men themselves;\" and that he was not in any case for\r\nburning down so vast a work as that was, because this would be a\r\nmischief to the Romans themselves, as it would be an ornament to their\r\ngovernment while it continued. So Fronto, and Alexander, and Cerealis\r\ngrew bold upon that declaration, and agreed to the opinion of Titus.\r\nThen was this assembly dissolved, when Titus had given orders to the\r\ncommanders that the rest of their forces should lie still; but that they\r\nshould make use of such as were most courageous in this attack. So he\r\ncommanded that the chosen men that were taken out of the cohorts should\r\nmake their way through the ruins, and quench the fire.\r\n\r\n4. Now it is true that on this day the Jews were so weary, and under\r\nsuch consternation, that they refrained from any attacks. But on the\r\nnext day they gathered their whole force together, and ran upon those\r\nthat guarded the outward court of the temple very boldly, through the\r\neast gate, and this about the second hour of the day. These guards\r\nreceived that their attack with great bravery, and by covering\r\nthemselves with their shields before, as if it were with a wall, they\r\ndrew their squadron close together; yet was it evident that they could\r\nnot abide there very long, but would be overborne by the multitude of\r\nthose that sallied out upon them, and by the heat of their passion.\r\nHowever, Caesar seeing, from the tower of Antonia, that this squadron\r\nwas likely to give way, he sent some chosen horsemen to support them.\r\nHereupon the Jews found themselves not able to sustain their onset, and\r\nupon the slaughter of those in the forefront, many of the rest were put\r\nto flight. But as the Romans were going off, the Jews turned upon them,\r\nand fought them; and as those Romans came back upon them, they retreated\r\nagain, until about the fifth hour of the day they were overborne, and\r\nshut themselves up in the inner [court of the] temple.\r\n\r\n5. So Titus retired into the tower of Antonia, and resolved to storm the\r\ntemple the next day, early in the morning, with his whole army, and to\r\nencamp round about the holy house. But as for that house, God had, for\r\ncertain, long ago doomed it to the fire; and now that fatal day was\r\ncome, according to the revolution of ages; it was the tenth day of\r\nthe month Lous, [Ab,] upon which it was formerly burnt by the king of\r\nBabylon; although these flames took their rise from the Jews themselves,\r\nand were occasioned by them; for upon Titus's retiring, the seditious\r\nlay still for a little while, and then attacked the Romans again, when\r\nthose that guarded the holy house fought with those that quenched the\r\nfire that was burning the inner [court of the] temple; but these Romans\r\nput the Jews to flight, and proceeded as far as the holy house itself.\r\nAt which time one of the soldiers, without staying for any orders, and\r\nwithout any concern or dread upon him at so great an undertaking, and\r\nbeing hurried on by a certain divine fury, snatched somewhat out of the\r\nmaterials that were on fire, and being lifted up by another soldier, he\r\nset fire to a golden window, through which there was a passage to the\r\nrooms that were round about the holy house, on the north side of it. As\r\nthe flames went upward, the Jews made a great clamor, such as so mighty\r\nan affliction required, and ran together to prevent it; and now they\r\nspared not their lives any longer, nor suffered any thing to restrain\r\ntheir force, since that holy house was perishing, for whose sake it was\r\nthat they kept such a guard about it.\r\n\r\n6. And now a certain person came running to Titus, and told him of\r\nthis fire, as he was resting himself in his tent after the last battle;\r\nwhereupon he rose up in great haste, and, as he was, ran to the holy\r\nhouse, in order to have a stop put to the fire; after him followed all\r\nhis commanders, and after them followed the several legions, in great\r\nastonishment; so there was a great clamor and tumult raised, as was\r\nnatural upon the disorderly motion of so great an army. Then did Caesar,\r\nboth by calling to the soldiers that were fighting, with a loud voice,\r\nand by giving a signal to them with his right hand, order them to quench\r\nthe fire. But they did not hear what he said, though he spake so loud,\r\nhaving their ears already dimmed by a greater noise another way; nor did\r\nthey attend to the signal he made with his hand neither, as still some\r\nof them were distracted with fighting, and others with passion. But as\r\nfor the legions that came running thither, neither any persuasions\r\nnor any threatenings could restrain their violence, but each one's own\r\npassion was his commander at this time; and as they were crowding into\r\nthe temple together, many of them were trampled on by one another, while\r\na great number fell among the ruins of the cloisters, which were still\r\nhot and smoking, and were destroyed in the same miserable way with those\r\nwhom they had conquered; and when they were come near the holy house,\r\nthey made as if they did not so much as hear Caesar's orders to the\r\ncontrary; but they encouraged those that were before them to set it on\r\nfire. As for the seditious, they were in too great distress already to\r\nafford their assistance [towards quenching the fire]; they were every\r\nwhere slain, and every where beaten; and as for a great part of the\r\npeople, they were weak and without arms, and had their throats cut\r\nwherever they were caught. Now round about the altar lay dead bodies\r\nheaped one upon another, as at the steps 16 going up to it ran a great\r\nquantity of their blood, whither also the dead bodies that were slain\r\nabove [on the altar] fell down.\r\n\r\n7. And now, since Caesar was no way able to restrain the enthusiastic\r\nfury of the soldiers, and the fire proceeded on more and more, he went\r\ninto the holy place of the temple, with his commanders, and saw it, with\r\nwhat was in it, which he found to be far superior to what the relations\r\nof foreigners contained, and not inferior to what we ourselves boasted\r\nof and believed about it. But as the flame had not as yet reached to its\r\ninward parts, but was still consuming the rooms that were about the\r\nholy house, and Titus supposing what the fact was, that the house itself\r\nmight yet be saved, he came in haste and endeavored to persuade the\r\nsoldiers to quench the fire, and gave order to Liberalius the centurion,\r\nand one of those spearmen that were about him, to beat the soldiers that\r\nwere refractory with their staves, and to restrain them; yet were their\r\npassions too hard for the regards they had for Caesar, and the dread\r\nthey had of him who forbade them, as was their hatred of the Jews, and\r\na certain vehement inclination to fight them, too hard for them also.\r\nMoreover, the hope of plunder induced many to go on, as having this\r\nopinion, that all the places within were full of money, and as seeing\r\nthat all round about it was made of gold. And besides, one of those\r\nthat went into the place prevented Caesar, when he ran so hastily out to\r\nrestrain the soldiers, and threw the fire upon the hinges of the gate,\r\nin the dark; whereby the flame burst out from within the holy house\r\nitself immediately, when the commanders retired, and Caesar with them,\r\nand when nobody any longer forbade those that were without to set\r\nfire to it. And thus was the holy house burnt down, without Caesar's\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\n8. Now although any one would justly lament the destruction of such a\r\nwork as this was, since it was the most admirable of all the works\r\nthat we have seen or heard of, both for its curious structure and its\r\nmagnitude, and also for the vast wealth bestowed upon it, as well as for\r\nthe glorious reputation it had for its holiness; yet might such a one\r\ncomfort himself with this thought, that it was fate that decreed it so\r\nto be, which is inevitable, both as to living creatures, and as to works\r\nand places also. However, one cannot but wonder at the accuracy of this\r\nperiod thereto relating; for the same month and day were now observed,\r\nas I said before, wherein the holy house was burnt formerly by the\r\nBabylonians. Now the number of years that passed from its first\r\nfoundation, which was laid by king Solomon, till this its destruction,\r\nwhich happened in the second year of the reign of Vespasian, are\r\ncollected to be one thousand one hundred and thirty, besides seven\r\nmonths and fifteen days; and from the second building of it, which\r\nwas done by Haggai, in the second year of Cyrus the king, till its\r\ndestruction under Vespasian, there were six hundred and thirty-nine\r\nyears and forty-five days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Great Distress The Jews Were In Upon The Conflagration\r\n     Of The Holy House. Concerning A False Prophet, And The Signs\r\n     That Preceded This Destruction.\r\n\r\n1. While the holy house was on fire, every thing was plundered that came\r\nto hand, and ten thousand of those that were caught were slain; nor\r\nwas there a commiseration of any age, or any reverence of gravity, but\r\nchildren, and old men, and profane persons, and priests were all slain\r\nin the same manner; so that this war went round all sorts of men, and\r\nbrought them to destruction, and as well those that made supplication\r\nfor their lives, as those that defended themselves by fighting. The\r\nflame was also carried a long way, and made an echo, together with the\r\ngroans of those that were slain; and because this hill was high, and the\r\nworks at the temple were very great, one would have thought the whole\r\ncity had been on fire. Nor can one imagine any thing either greater\r\nor more terrible than this noise; for there was at once a shout of the\r\nRoman legions, who were marching all together, and a sad clamor of the\r\nseditious, who were now surrounded with fire and sword. The people also\r\nthat were left above were beaten back upon the enemy, and under a great\r\nconsternation, and made sad moans at the calamity they were under; the\r\nmultitude also that was in the city joined in this outcry with those\r\nthat were upon the hill. And besides, many of those that were worn away\r\nby the famine, and their mouths almost closed, when they saw the fire of\r\nthe holy house, they exerted their utmost strength, and brake out into\r\ngroans and outcries again: Perea 17 did also return the echo, as well\r\nas the mountains round about [the city,] and augmented the force of\r\nthe entire noise. Yet was the misery itself more terrible than this\r\ndisorder; for one would have thought that the hill itself, on which the\r\ntemple stood, was seething hot, as full of fire on every part of it,\r\nthat the blood was larger in quantity than the fire, and those that were\r\nslain more in number than those that slew them; for the ground did\r\nno where appear visible, for the dead bodies that lay on it; but the\r\nsoldiers went over heaps of those bodies, as they ran upon such as fled\r\nfrom them. And now it was that the multitude of the robbers were thrust\r\nout [of the inner court of the temple by the Romans,] and had much ado\r\nto get into the outward court, and from thence into the city, while the\r\nremainder of the populace fled into the cloister of that outer court. As\r\nfor the priests, some of them plucked up from the holy house the spikes\r\n18 that were upon it, with their bases, which were made of lead, and\r\nshot them at the Romans instead of darts. But then as they gained\r\nnothing by so doing, and as the fire burst out upon them, they retired\r\nto the wall that was eight cubits broad, and there they tarried; yet did\r\ntwo of these of eminence among them, who might have saved themselves by\r\ngoing over to the Romans, or have borne up with courage, and taken their\r\nfortune with the others, throw themselves into the fire, and were burnt\r\ntogether with the holy house; their names were Meirus the son of Belgas,\r\nand Joseph the son of Daleus.\r\n\r\n2. And now the Romans, judging that it was in vain to spare what was\r\nround about the holy house, burnt all those places, as also the remains\r\nof the cloisters and the gates, two excepted; the one on the east side,\r\nand the other on the south; both which, however, they burnt afterward.\r\nThey also burnt down the treasury chambers, in which was an immense\r\nquantity of money, and an immense number of garments, and other precious\r\ngoods there reposited; and, to speak all in a few words, there it was\r\nthat the entire riches of the Jews were heaped up together, while\r\nthe rich people had there built themselves chambers [to contain such\r\nfurniture]. The soldiers also came to the rest of the cloisters that\r\nwere in the outer [court of the] temple, whither the women and children,\r\nand a great mixed multitude of the people, fled, in number about six\r\nthousand. But before Caesar had determined any thing about these people,\r\nor given the commanders any orders relating to them, the soldiers were\r\nin such a rage, that they set that cloister on fire; by which means it\r\ncame to pass that some of these were destroyed by throwing themselves\r\ndown headlong, and some were burnt in the cloisters themselves. Nor\r\ndid any one of them escape with his life. A false prophet 19 was\r\nthe occasion of these people's destruction, who had made a public\r\nproclamation in the city that very day, that God commanded them to get\r\nupon the temple, and that there they should receive miraculous signs of\r\ntheir deliverance. Now there was then a great number of false prophets\r\nsuborned by the tyrants to impose on the people, who denounced this to\r\nthem, that they should wait for deliverance from God; and this was in\r\norder to keep them from deserting, and that they might be buoyed up\r\nabove fear and care by such hopes. Now a man that is in adversity does\r\neasily comply with such promises; for when such a seducer makes him\r\nbelieve that he shall be delivered from those miseries which oppress\r\nhim, then it is that the patient is full of hopes of such his\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\n3. Thus were the miserable people persuaded by these deceivers, and such\r\nas belied God himself; while they did not attend nor give credit to the\r\nsigns that were so evident, and did so plainly foretell their future\r\ndesolation, but, like men infatuated, without either eyes to see or\r\nminds to consider, did not regard the denunciations that God made to\r\nthem. Thus there was a star 20 resembling a sword, which stood over the\r\ncity, and a comet, that continued a whole year. Thus also before the\r\nJews' rebellion, and before those commotions which preceded the war,\r\nwhen the people were come in great crowds to the feast of unleavened\r\nbread, on the eighth day of the month Xanthicus, 21 [Nisan,] and at the\r\nninth hour of the night, so great a light shone round the altar and the\r\nholy house, that it appeared to be bright day time; which lasted for\r\nhalf an hour. This light seemed to be a good sign to the unskillful,\r\nbut was so interpreted by the sacred scribes, as to portend those events\r\nthat followed immediately upon it. At the same festival also, a heifer,\r\nas she was led by the high priest to be sacrificed, brought forth a lamb\r\nin the midst of the temple. Moreover, the eastern gate of the inner 22\r\n[court of the] temple, which was of brass, and vastly heavy, and had\r\nbeen with difficulty shut by twenty men, and rested upon a basis armed\r\nwith iron, and had bolts fastened very deep into the firm floor, which\r\nwas there made of one entire stone, was seen to be opened of its own\r\naccord about the sixth hour of the night. Now those that kept watch in\r\nthe temple came hereupon running to the captain of the temple, and told\r\nhim of it; who then came up thither, and not without great difficulty\r\nwas able to shut the gate again. This also appeared to the vulgar to\r\nbe a very happy prodigy, as if God did thereby open them the gate of\r\nhappiness. But the men of learning understood it, that the security of\r\ntheir holy house was dissolved of its own accord, and that the gate was\r\nopened for the advantage of their enemies. So these publicly declared\r\nthat the signal foreshowed the desolation that was coming upon them.\r\nBesides these, a few days after that feast, on the one and twentieth\r\nday of the month Artemisius, [Jyar,] a certain prodigious and incredible\r\nphenomenon appeared: I suppose the account of it would seem to be a\r\nfable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the events\r\nthat followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such signals;\r\nfor, before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor\r\nwere seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities.\r\nMoreover, at that feast which we call Pentecost, as the priests were\r\ngoing by night into the inner [court of the temple,] as their custom\r\nwas, to perform their sacred ministrations, they said that, in the first\r\nplace, they felt a quaking, and heard a great noise, and after that they\r\nheard a sound as of a great multitude, saying, \"Let us remove hence.\"\r\nBut, what is still more terrible, there was one Jesus, the son of\r\nAnanus, a plebeian and a husbandman, who, four years before the\r\nwar began, and at a time when the city was in very great peace and\r\nprosperity, came to that feast whereon it is our custom for every one\r\nto make tabernacles to God in the temple, 23 began on a sudden to cry\r\naloud, \"A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from\r\nthe four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice\r\nagainst the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against this whole\r\npeople!\" This was his cry, as he went about by day and by night, in all\r\nthe lanes of the city. However, certain of the most eminent among the\r\npopulace had great indignation at this dire cry of his, and took up\r\nthe man, and gave him a great number of severe stripes; yet did not he\r\neither say any thing for himself, or any thing peculiar to those that\r\nchastised him, but still went on with the same words which he cried\r\nbefore. Hereupon our rulers, supposing, as the case proved to be, that\r\nthis was a sort of divine fury in the man, brought him to the Roman\r\nprocurator, where he was whipped till his bones were laid bare; yet\r\nhe did not make any supplication for himself, nor shed any tears, but\r\nturning his voice to the most lamentable tone possible, at every stroke\r\nof the whip his answer was, \"Woe, woe to Jerusalem!\" And when Albinus\r\n[for he was then our procurator] asked him, Who he was? and whence he\r\ncame? and why he uttered such words? he made no manner of reply to what\r\nhe said, but still did not leave off his melancholy ditty, till Albinus\r\ntook him to be a madman, and dismissed him. Now, during all the time\r\nthat passed before the war began, this man did not go near any of\r\nthe citizens, nor was seen by them while he said so; but he every day\r\nuttered these lamentable words, as if it were his premeditated vow,\r\n\"Woe, woe to Jerusalem!\" Nor did he give ill words to any of those that\r\nbeat him every day, nor good words to those that gave him food; but this\r\nwas his reply to all men, and indeed no other than a melancholy presage\r\nof what was to come. This cry of his was the loudest at the festivals;\r\nand he continued this ditty for seven years and five months, without\r\ngrowing hoarse, or being tired therewith, until the very time that he\r\nsaw his presage in earnest fulfilled in our siege, when it ceased; for\r\nas he was going round upon the wall, he cried out with his utmost force,\r\n\"Woe, woe to the city again, and to the people, and to the holy house!\"\r\nAnd just as he added at the last, \"Woe, woe to myself also!\" there\r\ncame a stone out of one of the engines, and smote him, and killed him\r\nimmediately; and as he was uttering the very same presages he gave up\r\nthe ghost.\r\n\r\n4. Now if any one consider these things, he will find that God takes\r\ncare of mankind, and by all ways possible foreshows to our race what is\r\nfor their preservation; but that men perish by those miseries which\r\nthey madly and voluntarily bring upon themselves; for the Jews, by\r\ndemolishing the tower of Antonia, had made their temple four-square,\r\nwhile at the same time they had it written in their sacred oracles,\r\n\"That then should their city be taken, as well as their holy house, when\r\nonce their temple should become four-square.\" But now, what did the most\r\nelevate them in undertaking this war, was an ambiguous oracle that was\r\nalso found in their sacred writings, how, \"about that time, one from\r\ntheir country should become governor of the habitable earth.\" The Jews\r\ntook this prediction to belong to themselves in particular, and many\r\nof the wise men were thereby deceived in their determination. Now this\r\noracle certainly denoted the government of Vespasian, who was appointed\r\nemperor in Judea. However, it is not possible for men to avoid fate,\r\nalthough they see it beforehand. But these men interpreted some of these\r\nsignals according to their own pleasure, and some of them they utterly\r\ndespised, until their madness was demonstrated, both by the taking of\r\ntheir city and their own destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The Romans Carried Their Ensigns To The Temple, And Made\r\n     Joyful Acclamations To Titus. The Speech That Titus Made To\r\n     The Jews When They Made Supplication For Mercy. What Reply\r\n     They Made Thereto; And How That Reply Moved Titus's\r\n     Indignation Against Them.\r\n\r\n1. And now the Romans, upon the flight of the seditious into the city,\r\nand upon the burning of the holy house itself, and of all the buildings\r\nround about it, brought their ensigns to the temple 24 and set them over\r\nagainst its eastern gate; and there did they offer sacrifices to\r\nthem, and there did they make Titus imperator 25 with the greatest\r\nacclamations of joy. And now all the soldiers had such vast quantities\r\nof the spoils which they had gotten by plunder, that in Syria a pound\r\nweight of gold was sold for half its former value. But as for those\r\npriests that kept themselves still upon the wall of the holy house,26\r\nthere was a boy that, out of the thirst he was in, desired some of the\r\nRoman guards to give him their right hands as a security for his life,\r\nand confessed he was very thirsty. These guards commiserated his age,\r\nand the distress he was in, and gave him their right hands accordingly.\r\nSo he came down himself, and drank some water, and filled the vessel\r\nhe had with him when he came to them with water, and then went off, and\r\nfled away to his own friends; nor could any of those guards overtake\r\nhim; but still they reproached him for his perfidiousness. To which he\r\nmade this answer: \"I have not broken the agreement; for the security I\r\nhad given me was not in order to my staying with you, but only in order\r\nto my coming down safely, and taking up some water; both which things I\r\nhave performed, and thereupon think myself to have been faithful to my\r\nengagement.\" Hereupon those whom the child had imposed upon admired at\r\nhis cunning, and that on account of his age. On the fifth day afterward,\r\nthe priests that were pined with the famine came down, and when they\r\nwere brought to Titus by the guards, they begged for their lives; but he\r\nreplied, that the time of pardon was over as to them, and that this\r\nvery holy house, on whose account only they could justly hope to be\r\npreserved, was destroyed; and that it was agreeable to their office that\r\npriests should perish with the house itself to which they belonged. So\r\nhe ordered them to be put to death.\r\n\r\n2. But as for the tyrants themselves, and those that were with them,\r\nwhen they found that they were encompassed on every side, and, as it\r\nwere, walled round, without any method of escaping, they desired to\r\ntreat with Titus by word of mouth. Accordingly, such was the kindness\r\nof his nature, and his desire of preserving the city from destruction,\r\njoined to the advice of his friends, who now thought the robbers were\r\ncome to a temper, that he placed himself on the western side of the\r\nouter [court of the] temple; for there were gates on that side above the\r\nXystus, and a bridge that connected the upper city to the temple. This\r\nbridge it was that lay between the tyrants and Caesar, and parted them;\r\nwhile the multitude stood on each side; those of the Jewish nation\r\nabout Sinran and John, with great hopes of pardon; and the Romans about\r\nCaesar, in great expectation how Titus would receive their supplication.\r\nSo Titus charged his soldiers to restrain their rage, and to let their\r\ndarts alone, and appointed an interpreter between them, which was a sign\r\nthat he was the conqueror, and first began the discourse, and said, \"I\r\nhope you, sirs, are now satiated with the miseries of your country, who\r\nhave not had any just notions, either of our great power, or of your own\r\ngreat weakness, but have, like madmen, after a violent and inconsiderate\r\nmanner, made such attempts, as have brought your people, your city, and\r\nyour holy house to destruction. You have been the men that have never\r\nleft off rebelling since Pompey first conquered you, and have, since\r\nthat time, made open war with the Romans. Have you depended on your\r\nmultitude, while a very small part of the Roman soldiery have been\r\nstrong enough for you? Have you relied on the fidelity of your\r\nconfederates? And what nations are there, out of the limits of our\r\ndominion, that would choose to assist the Jews before the Romans? Are\r\nyour bodies stronger than ours? nay, you know that the [strong] Germans\r\nthemselves are our servants. Have you stronger walls than we have? Pray,\r\nwhat greater obstacle is there than the wall of the ocean, with which\r\nthe Britons are encompassed, and yet do adore the arms of the Romans.\r\nDo you exceed us in courage of soul, and in the sagacity of your\r\ncommanders? Nay, indeed, you cannot but know that the very Carthaginians\r\nhave been conquered by us. It can therefore be nothing certainly but\r\nthe kindness of us Romans which hath excited you against us; who, in\r\nthe first place, have given you this land to possess; and, in the next\r\nplace, have set over you kings of your own nation; and, in the third\r\nplace, have preserved the laws of your forefathers to you, and have\r\nwithal permitted you to live, either by yourselves, or among others, as\r\nit should please you: and, what is our chief favor of all we have given\r\nyou leave to gather up that tribute which is paid to God 27 with such\r\nother gifts that are dedicated to him; nor have we called those that\r\ncarried these donations to account, nor prohibited them; till at length\r\nyou became richer than we ourselves, even when you were our enemies; and\r\nyou made preparations for war against us with our own money; nay, after\r\nall, when you were in the enjoyment of all these advantages, you\r\nturned your too great plenty against those that gave it you, and, like\r\nmerciless serpents, have thrown out your poison against those that\r\ntreated you kindly. I suppose, therefore, that you might despise the\r\nslothfulness of Nero, and, like limbs of the body that are broken or\r\ndislocated, you did then lie quiet, waiting for some other time, though\r\nstill with a malicious intention, and have now showed your distemper\r\nto be greater than ever, and have extended your desires as far as your\r\nimpudent and immense hopes would enable you to do it. At this time my\r\nfather came into this country, not with a design to punish you for what\r\nyou had done under Cestius, but to admonish you; for had he come to\r\noverthrow your nation, he had run directly to your fountain-head, and\r\nhad immediately laid this city waste; whereas he went and burnt Galilee\r\nand the neighboring parts, and thereby gave you time for repentance;\r\nwhich instance of humanity you took for an argument of his weakness, and\r\nnourished up your impudence by our mildness. When Nero was gone out\r\nof the world, you did as the wickedest wretches would have done, and\r\nencouraged yourselves to act against us by our civil dissensions, and\r\nabused that time, when both I and my father were gone away to Egypt,\r\nto make preparations for this war. Nor were you ashamed to raise\r\ndisturbances against us when we were made emperors, and this while you\r\nhad experienced how mild we had been, when we were no more than generals\r\nof the army. But when the government was devolved upon us, and all other\r\npeople did thereupon lie quiet, and even foreign nations sent embassies,\r\nand congratulated our access to the government, then did you Jews show\r\nyourselves to be our enemies. You sent embassies to those of your nation\r\nthat are beyond Euphrates to assist you in your raising disturbances;\r\nnew walls were built by you round your city, seditions arose, and one\r\ntyrant contended against another, and a civil war broke out among you;\r\nsuch indeed as became none but so wicked a people as you are. I then\r\ncame to this city, as unwillingly sent by my father, and received\r\nmelancholy injunctions from him. When I heard that the people were\r\ndisposed to peace, I rejoiced at it; I exhorted you to leave off these\r\nproceedings before I began this war; I spared you even when you had\r\nfought against me a great while; I gave my right hand as security to the\r\ndeserters; I observed what I had promised faithfully. When they fled\r\nto me, I had compassion on many of those that I had taken captive; I\r\ntortured those that were eager for war, in order to restrain them. It\r\nwas unwillingly that I brought my engines of war against your walls; I\r\nalways prohibited my soldiers, when they were set upon your slaughter,\r\nfrom their severity against you. After every victory I persuaded you\r\nto peace, as though I had been myself conquered. When I came near your\r\ntemple, I again departed from the laws of war, and exhorted you to spare\r\nyour own sanctuary, and to preserve your holy house to yourselves. I\r\nallowed you a quiet exit out of it, and security for your preservation;\r\nnay, if you had a mind, I gave you leave to fight in another place. Yet\r\nhave you still despised every one of my proposals, and have set fire\r\nto your holy house with your own hands. And now, vile wretches, do you\r\ndesire to treat with me by word of mouth? To what purpose is it that you\r\nwould save such a holy house as this was, which is now destroyed? What\r\npreservation can you now desire after the destruction of your temple?\r\nYet do you stand still at this very time in your armor; nor can you\r\nbring yourselves so much as to pretend to be supplicants even in this\r\nyour utmost extremity. O miserable creatures! what is it you depend on?\r\nAre not your people dead? is not your holy house gone? is not your city\r\nin my power? and are not your own very lives in my hands? And do you\r\nstill deem it a part of valor to die? However, I will not imitate your\r\nmadness. If you throw down your arms, and deliver up your bodies to me,\r\nI grant you your lives; and I will act like a mild master of a family;\r\nwhat cannot be healed shall be punished, and the rest I will preserve\r\nfor my own use.\"\r\n\r\n3. To that offer of Titus they made this reply: That they could not\r\naccept of it, because they had sworn never to do so; but they desired\r\nthey might have leave to go through the wall that had been made about\r\nthem, with their wives and children; for that they would go into the\r\ndesert, and leave the city to him. At this Titus had great indignation,\r\nthat when they were in the case of men already taken captives, they\r\nshould pretend to make their own terms with him, as if they had been\r\nconquerors. So he ordered this proclamation to be made to them, That\r\nthey should no more come out to him as deserters, nor hope for any\r\nfurther security; for that he would henceforth spare nobody, but fight\r\nthem with his whole army; and that they must save themselves as well as\r\nthey could; for that he would from henceforth treat them according to\r\nthe laws of war. So he gave orders to the soldiers both to burn and to\r\nplunder the city; who did nothing indeed that day; but on the next\r\nday they set fire to the repository of the archives, to Acra, to the\r\ncouncil-house, and to the place called Ophlas; at which time the fire\r\nproceeded as far as the palace of queen Helena, which was in the middle\r\nof Acra; the lanes also were burnt down, as were also those houses that\r\nwere full of the dead bodies of such as were destroyed by famine.\r\n\r\n4. On the same day it was that the sons and brethren of Izates the\r\nking, together with many others of the eminent men of the populace,\r\ngot together there, and besought Caesar to give them his right hand for\r\ntheir security; upon which, though he was very angry at all that were\r\nnow remaining, yet did he not lay aside his old moderation, but received\r\nthese men. At that time, indeed, he kept them all in custody, but still\r\nbound the king's sons and kinsmen, and led them with him to Rome, in\r\norder to make them hostages for their country's fidelity to the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     What Afterward Befell The Seditious When They Had Done A\r\n     Great Deal Of Mischief, And Suffered Many Misfortunes; As\r\n     Also How Caesar Became Master Of The Upper City.\r\n\r\n1. And now the seditious rushed into the royal palace, into which many\r\nhad put their effects, because it was so strong, and drove the Romans\r\naway from it. They also slew all the people that had crowded into it,\r\nwho were in number about eight thousand four hundred, and plundered them\r\nof what they had. They also took two of the Romans alive; the one was\r\na horseman, and the other a footman. They then cut the throat of the\r\nfootman, and immediately had him drawn through the whole city, as\r\nrevenging themselves upon the whole body of the Romans by this one\r\ninstance. But the horseman said he had somewhat to suggest to them in\r\norder to their preservation; whereupon he was brought before Simon; but\r\nhe having nothing to say when he was there, he was delivered to Ardalas,\r\none of his commanders, to be punished, who bound his hands behind him,\r\nand put a riband over his eyes, and then brought him out over against\r\nthe Romans, as intending to cut off his head. But the man prevented\r\nthat execution, and ran away to the Romans, and this while the Jewish\r\nexecutioner was drawing out his sword. Now when he was gotten away from\r\nthe enemy, Titus could not think of putting him to death; but because he\r\ndeemed him unworthy of being a Roman soldier any longer, on account that\r\nhe had been taken alive by the enemy, he took away his arms, and ejected\r\nhim out of the legion whereto he had belonged; which, to one that had a\r\nsense of shame, was a penalty severer than death itself.\r\n\r\n2. On the next day the Romans drove the robbers out of the lower city,\r\nand set all on fire as far as Siloam. These soldiers were indeed glad\r\nto see the city destroyed. But they missed the plunder, because the\r\nseditious had carried off all their effects, and were retired into the\r\nupper city; for they did not yet at all repent of the mischiefs they had\r\ndone, but were insolent, as if they had done well; for, as they saw the\r\ncity on fire, they appeared cheerful, and put on joyful countenances, in\r\nexpectation, as they said, of death to end their miseries. Accordingly,\r\nas the people were now slain, the holy house was burnt down, and the\r\ncity was on fire, there was nothing further left for the enemy to do.\r\nYet did not Josephus grow weary, even in this utmost extremity, to beg\r\nof them to spare what was left of the city; he spake largely to them\r\nabout their barbarity and impiety, and gave them his advice in order to\r\ntheir escape; though he gained nothing thereby more than to be laughed\r\nat by them; and as they could not think of surrendering themselves up,\r\nbecause of the oath they had taken, nor were strong enough to fight with\r\nthe Romans any longer upon the square, as being surrounded on all sides,\r\nand a kind of prisoners already, yet were they so accustomed to kill\r\npeople, that they could not restrain their right hands from acting\r\naccordingly. So they dispersed themselves before the city, and laid\r\nthemselves in ambush among its ruins, to catch those that attempted to\r\ndesert to the Romans; accordingly many such deserters were caught by\r\nthem, and were all slain; for these were too weak, by reason of their\r\nwant of food, to fly away from them; so their dead bodies were thrown to\r\nthe dogs. Now every other sort of death was thought more tolerable than\r\nthe famine, insomuch that, though the Jews despaired now of mercy, yet\r\nwould they fly to the Romans, and would themselves, even of their own\r\naccord, fall among the murderous rebels also. Nor was there any place\r\nin the city that had no dead bodies in it, but what was entirely covered\r\nwith those that were killed either by the famine or the rebellion; and\r\nall was full of the dead bodies of such as had perished, either by that\r\nsedition or by that famine.\r\n\r\n3. So now the last hope which supported the tyrants, and that crew of\r\nrobbers who were with them, was in the caves and caverns under ground;\r\nwhither, if they could once fly, they did not expect to be searched for;\r\nbut endeavored, that after the whole city should be destroyed, and the\r\nRomans gone away, they might come out again, and escape from them. This\r\nwas no better than a dream of theirs; for they were not able to lie\r\nhid either from God or from the Romans. However, they depended on these\r\nunder-ground subterfuges, and set more places on fire than did the\r\nRomans themselves; and those that fled out of their houses thus set\r\non fire into the ditches, they killed without mercy, and pillaged them\r\nalso; and if they discovered food belonging to any one, they seized upon\r\nit and swallowed it down, together with their blood also; nay, they were\r\nnow come to fight one with another about their plunder; and I cannot\r\nbut think that, had not their destruction prevented it, their barbarity\r\nwould have made them taste of even the dead bodies themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Caesar Raised Banks Round About The Upper City [Mount\r\n     Zion] And When They Were Completed, Gave Orders That The\r\n     Machines Should Be Brought. He Then Possessed Himself Of The\r\n     Whole City.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Caesar perceived that the upper city was so steep that\r\nit could not possibly be taken without raising banks against it, he\r\ndistributed the several parts of that work among his army, and this\r\non the twentieth day of the month Lous [Ab]. Now the carriage of the\r\nmaterials was a difficult task, since all the trees, as I have already\r\ntold you, that were about the city, within the distance of a hundred\r\nfurlongs, had their branches cut off already, in order to make the\r\nformer banks. The works that belonged to the four legions were erected\r\non the west side of the city, over against the royal palace; but the\r\nwhole body of the auxiliary troops, with the rest of the multitude that\r\nwere with them, [erected their banks] at the Xystus, whence they reached\r\nto the bridge, and that tower of Simon which he had built as a citadel\r\nfor himself against John, when they were at war one with another.\r\n\r\n2. It was at this time that the commanders of the Idumeans got together\r\nprivately, and took counsel about surrendering up themselves to the\r\nRomans. Accordingly, they sent five men to Titus, and entreated him to\r\ngive them his right hand for their security. So Titus thinking that the\r\ntyrants would yield, if the Idumeans, upon whom a great part of the\r\nwar depended, were once withdrawn from them, after some reluctancy and\r\ndelay, complied with them, and gave them security for their lives, and\r\nsent the five men back. But as these Idumeans were preparing to march\r\nout, Simon perceived it, and immediately slew the five men that had gone\r\nto Titus, and took their commanders, and put them in prison, of whom the\r\nmost eminent was Jacob, the son of Sosas; but as for the multitude of\r\nthe Idumeans, who did not at all know what to do, now their commanders\r\nwere taken from them, he had them watched, and secured the walls by a\r\nmore numerous garrison, Yet could not that garrison resist those that\r\nwere deserting; for although a great number of them were slain, yet were\r\nthe deserters many more in number. They were all received by the Romans,\r\nbecause Titus himself grew negligent as to his former orders for killing\r\nthem, and because the very soldiers grew weary of killing them, and\r\nbecause they hoped to get some money by sparing them; for they left only\r\nthe populace, and sold the rest of the multitude, 28 with their wives\r\nand children, and every one of them at a very low price, and that\r\nbecause such as were sold were very many, and the buyers were few: and\r\nalthough Titus had made proclamation beforehand, that no deserter should\r\ncome alone by himself, that so they might bring out their families with\r\nthem, yet did he receive such as these also. However, he set over them\r\nsuch as were to distinguish some from others, in order to see if any of\r\nthem deserved to be punished. And indeed the number of those that were\r\nsold was immense; but of the populace above forty thousand were saved,\r\nwhom Caesar let go whither every one of them pleased.\r\n\r\n3. But now at this time it was that one of the priests, the son of\r\nThebuthus, whose name was Jesus, upon his having security given him, by\r\nthe oath of Caesar, that he should be preserved, upon condition that\r\nhe should deliver to him certain of the precious things that had been\r\nreposited in the temple 29 came out of it, and delivered him from the\r\nwall of the holy house two candlesticks, like to those that lay in the\r\nholy house, with tables, and cisterns, and vials, all made of solid\r\ngold, and very heavy. He also delivered to him the veils and the\r\ngarments, with the precious stones, and a great number of other precious\r\nvessels that belonged to their sacred worship. The treasurer of the\r\ntemple also, whose name was Phineas, was seized on, and showed Titus the\r\ncoats and girdles of the priests, with a great quantity of purple and\r\nscarlet, which were there reposited for the uses of the veil, as also a\r\ngreat deal of cinnamon and cassia, with a large quantity of other sweet\r\nspices, 30 which used to be mixed together, and offered as incense to\r\nGod every day. A great many other treasures were also delivered to\r\nhim, with sacred ornaments of the temple not a few; which things thus\r\ndelivered to Titus obtained of him for this man the same pardon that he\r\nhad allowed to such as deserted of their own accord.\r\n\r\n4. And now were the banks finished on the seventh day of the month\r\nGorpieus, [Elul,] in eighteen days' time, when the Romans brought their\r\nmachines against the wall. But for the seditious, some of them, as\r\ndespairing of saving the city, retired from the wall to the citadel;\r\nothers of them went down into the subterranean vaults, though still a\r\ngreat many of them defended themselves against those that brought the\r\nengines for the battery; yet did the Romans overcome them by their\r\nnumber and by their strength; and, what was the principal thing of\r\nall, by going cheerfully about their work, while the Jews were quite\r\ndejected, and become weak. Now as soon as a part of the wall was\r\nbattered down, and certain of the towers yielded to the impression of\r\nthe battering rams, those that opposed themselves fled away, and such\r\na terror fell upon the tyrants, as was much greater than the occasion\r\nrequired; for before the enemy got over the breach they were quite\r\nstunned, and were immediately for flying away. And now one might see\r\nthese men, who had hitherto been so insolent and arrogant in their\r\nwicked practices, to be cast down and to tremble, insomuch that it\r\nwould pity one's heart to observe the change that was made in those vile\r\npersons. Accordingly, they ran with great violence upon the Roman wall\r\nthat encompassed them, in order to force away those that guarded it, and\r\nto break through it, and get away. But when they saw that those who had\r\nformerly been faithful to them had gone away, [as indeed they were fled\r\nwhithersoever the great distress they were in persuaded them to flee,]\r\nas also when those that came running before the rest told them that the\r\nwestern wall was entirely overthrown, while others said the Romans were\r\ngotten in, and others that they were near, and looking out for them,\r\nwhich were only the dictates of their fear, which imposed upon their\r\nsight, they fell upon their face, and greatly lamented their own mad\r\nconduct; and their nerves were so terribly loosed, that they could\r\nnot flee away. And here one may chiefly reflect on the power of God\r\nexercised upon these wicked wretches, and on the good fortune of the\r\nRomans; for these tyrants did now wholly deprive themselves of the\r\nsecurity they had in their own power, and came down from those very\r\ntowers of their own accord, wherein they could have never been taken\r\nby force, nor indeed by any other way than by famine. And thus did the\r\nRomans, when they had taken such great pains about weaker walls, get\r\nby good fortune what they could never have gotten by their engines;\r\nfor three of these towers were too strong for all mechanical engines\r\nwhatsoever, concerning which we have treated above.\r\n\r\n5. So they now left these towers of themselves, or rather they were\r\nejected out of them by God himself, and fled immediately to that valley\r\nwhich was under Siloam, where they again recovered themselves out of the\r\ndread they were in for a while, and ran violently against that part of\r\nthe Roman wall which lay on that side; but as their courage was too much\r\ndepressed to make their attacks with sufficient force, and their power\r\nwas now broken with fear and affliction, they were repulsed by the\r\nguards, and dispersing themselves at distances from each other, went\r\ndown into the subterranean caverns. So the Romans being now become\r\nmasters of the walls, they both placed their ensigns upon the towers,\r\nand made joyful acclamations for the victory they had gained, as having\r\nfound the end of this war much lighter than its beginning; for when they\r\nhad gotten upon the last wall, without any bloodshed, they could hardly\r\nbelieve what they found to be true; but seeing nobody to oppose them,\r\nthey stood in doubt what such an unusual solitude could mean. But when\r\nthey went in numbers into the lanes of the city with their swords drawn,\r\nthey slew those whom they overtook without and set fire to the houses\r\nwhither the Jews were fled, and burnt every soul in them, and laid\r\nwaste a great many of the rest; and when they were come to the houses\r\nto plunder them, they found in them entire families of dead men, and\r\nthe upper rooms full of dead corpses, that is, of such as died by the\r\nfamine; they then stood in a horror at this sight, and went out without\r\ntouching any thing. But although they had this commiseration for such as\r\nwere destroyed in that manner, yet had they not the same for those that\r\nwere still alive, but they ran every one through whom they met with,\r\nand obstructed the very lanes with their dead bodies, and made the whole\r\ncity run down with blood, to such a degree indeed that the fire of\r\nmany of the houses was quenched with these men's blood. And truly so it\r\nhappened, that though the slayers left off at the evening, yet did the\r\nfire greatly prevail in the night; and as all was burning, came that\r\neighth day of the month Gorpieus [Elul] upon Jerusalem, a city that had\r\nbeen liable to so many miseries during this siege, that, had it always\r\nenjoyed as much happiness from its first foundation, it would certainly\r\nhave been the envy of the world. Nor did it on any other account so much\r\ndeserve these sore misfortunes, as by producing such a generation of men\r\nas were the occasions of this its overthrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n     What Injunctions Caesar Gave When He Was Come Within The\r\n     City. The Number Of The Captives And Of Those That Perished\r\n     In The Siege; As Also Concerning Those That Had Escaped Into\r\n     The Subterranean Caverns, Among Whom Were The Tyrants Simon\r\n     And John Themselves.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Titus was come into this [upper] city, he admired not only\r\nsome other places of strength in it, but particularly those strong\r\ntowers which the tyrants in their mad conduct had relinquished; for when\r\nhe saw their solid altitude, and the largeness of their several stones,\r\nand the exactness of their joints, as also how great was their breadth,\r\nand how extensive their length, he expressed himself after the manner\r\nfollowing: \"We have certainly had God for our assistant in this war,\r\nand it was no other than God who ejected the Jews out of these\r\nfortifications; for what could the hands of men or any machines do\r\ntowards overthrowing these towers?\" At which time he had many such\r\ndiscourses to his friends; he also let such go free as had been bound by\r\nthe tyrants, and were left in the prisons. To conclude, when he entirely\r\ndemolished the rest of the city, and overthrew its walls, he left\r\nthese towers as a monument of his good fortune, which had proved his\r\nauxiliaries, and enabled him to take what could not otherwise have been\r\ntaken by him.\r\n\r\n2. And now, since his soldiers were already quite tired with killing\r\nmen, and yet there appeared to be a vast multitude still remaining\r\nalive, Caesar gave orders that they should kill none but those that were\r\nin arms, and opposed them, but should take the rest alive. But, together\r\nwith those whom they had orders to slay, they slew the aged and the\r\ninfirm; but for those that were in their flourishing age, and who might\r\nbe useful to them, they drove them together into the temple, and shut\r\nthem up within the walls of the court of the women; over which Caesar\r\nset one of his freed-men, as also Fronto, one of his own friends; which\r\nlast was to determine every one's fate, according to his merits. So\r\nthis Fronto slew all those that had been seditious and robbers, who were\r\nimpeached one by another; but of the young men he chose out the tallest\r\nand most beautiful, and reserved them for the triumph; and as for the\r\nrest of the multitude that were above seventeen years old, he put them\r\ninto bonds, and sent them to the Egyptian mines. 31 Titus also sent a\r\ngreat number into the provinces, as a present to them, that they might\r\nbe destroyed upon their theatres, by the sword and by the wild beasts;\r\nbut those that were under seventeen years of age were sold for slaves.\r\nNow during the days wherein Fronto was distinguishing these men, there\r\nperished, for want of food, eleven thousand; some of whom did not taste\r\nany food, through the hatred their guards bore to them; and others would\r\nnot take in any when it was given them. The multitude also was so very\r\ngreat, that they were in want even of corn for their sustenance.\r\n\r\n3. Now the number 32 of those that were carried captive during this\r\nwhole war was collected to be ninety-seven thousand; as was the number\r\nof those that perished during the whole siege eleven hundred thousand,\r\nthe greater part of whom were indeed of the same nation [with the\r\ncitizens of Jerusalem], but not belonging to the city itself; for they\r\nwere come up from all the country to the feast of unleavened bread,\r\nand were on a sudden shut up by an army, which, at the very first,\r\noccasioned so great a straitness among them, that there came a\r\npestilential destruction upon them, and soon afterward such a famine, as\r\ndestroyed them more suddenly. And that this city could contain so many\r\npeople in it, is manifest by that number of them which was taken under\r\nCestius, who being desirous of informing Nero of the power of the city,\r\nwho otherwise was disposed to contemn that nation, entreated the high\r\npriests, if the thing were possible, to take the number of their whole\r\nmultitude. So these high priests, upon the coming of that feast which\r\nis called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ninth\r\nhour till the eleventh, but so that a company not less than ten 33\r\nbelong to every sacrifice, [for it is not lawful for them to feast\r\nsingly by themselves,] and many of us are twenty in a company, found\r\nthe number of sacrifices was two hundred and fifty-six thousand five\r\nhundred; which, upon the allowance of no more than ten that feast\r\ntogether, amounts to two millions seven hundred thousand and two hundred\r\npersons that were pure and holy; for as to those that have the leprosy,\r\nor the gonorrhea, or women that have their monthly courses, or such as\r\nare otherwise polluted, it is not lawful for them to be partakers of\r\nthis sacrifice; nor indeed for any foreigners neither, who come hither\r\nto worship.\r\n\r\n4. Now this vast multitude is indeed collected out of remote places, but\r\nthe entire nation was now shut up by fate as in prison, and the\r\nRoman army encompassed the city when it was crowded with inhabitants.\r\nAccordingly, the multitude of those that therein perished exceeded all\r\nthe destructions that either men or God ever brought upon the world;\r\nfor, to speak only of what was publicly known, the Romans slew some\r\nof them, some they carried captives, and others they made a search for\r\nunder ground, and when they found where they were, they broke up the\r\nground and slew all they met with. There were also found slain there\r\nabove two thousand persons, partly by their own hands, and partly by one\r\nanother, but chiefly destroyed by the famine; but then the ill savor\r\nof the dead bodies was most offensive to those that lighted upon them,\r\ninsomuch that some were obliged to get away immediately, while others\r\nwere so greedy of gain, that they would go in among the dead bodies\r\nthat lay on heaps, and tread upon them; for a great deal of treasure was\r\nfound in these caverns, and the hope of gain made every way of getting\r\nit to be esteemed lawful. Many also of those that had been put in prison\r\nby the tyrants were now brought out; for they did not leave off their\r\nbarbarous cruelty at the very last: yet did God avenge himself upon them\r\nboth, in a manner agreeable to justice. As for John, he wanted food,\r\ntogether with his brethren, in these caverns, and begged that the Romans\r\nwould now give him their right hand for his security, which he had\r\noften proudly rejected before; but for Simon, he struggled hard with\r\nthe distress he was in, still he was forced to surrender himself, as we\r\nshall relate hereafter; so he was reserved for the triumph, and to be\r\nthen slain; as was John condemned to perpetual imprisonment. And now the\r\nRomans set fire to the extreme parts of the city, and burnt them down,\r\nand entirely demolished its walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     That Whereas The City Of Jerusalem Had Been Five Times Taken\r\n     Formerly, This Was The Second Time Of Its Desolation. A\r\n     Brief Account Of Its History.\r\n\r\n1. And thus was Jerusalem taken, in the second year of the reign of\r\nVespasian, on the eighth day of the month Gorpeius [Elul]. It had been\r\ntaken five 34 times before, though this was the second time of its\r\ndesolation; for Shishak, the king of Egypt, and after him Antiochus, and\r\nafter him Pompey, and after them Sosius and Herod, took the city, but\r\nstill preserved it; but before all these, the king of Babylon conquered\r\nit, and made it desolate, one thousand four hundred and sixty-eight\r\nyears and six months after it was built. But he who first built it was\r\na potent man among the Canaanites, and is in our own tongue called\r\n[Melchisedek], the Righteous King, for such he really was; on which\r\naccount he was [there] the first priest of God, and first built a temple\r\n[there], 35 and called the city Jerusalem, which was formerly called\r\nSalem. However, David, the king of the Jews, ejected the Canaanites,\r\nand settled his own people therein. It was demolished entirely by the\r\nBabylonians, four hundred and seventy-seven years and six months after\r\nhim. And from king David, who was the first of the Jews who reigned\r\ntherein, to this destruction under Titus, were one thousand one hundred\r\nand seventy-nine years; but from its first building, till this last\r\ndestruction, were two thousand one hundred and seventy-seven years; yet\r\nhath not its great antiquity, nor its vast riches, nor the diffusion\r\nof its nation over all the habitable earth, nor the greatness of\r\nthe veneration paid to it on a religious account, been sufficient to\r\npreserve it from being destroyed. And thus ended the siege of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nWAR BOOK 6 FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Reland notes here, very pertinently, that the tower of\r\nAntonia stood higher than the floor of the temple or court adjoining\r\nto it; and that accordingly they descended thence into the temple, as\r\nJosephus elsewhere speaks also.

The former\r\naccount is, in all probability, the truest; for had not that fourth\r\nson escaped before the others were caught and put to death, he had been\r\ncaught and put to death with them.

He might have had more examples, I suppose, of persons on\r\nship-board, or in a desert island, casting lots for each others' bodies;\r\nbut all this was only in cases where they knew of no possible way to\r\navoid death themselves but by killing and eating others. Whether such\r\nexamples come up to the present case may be doubted. The Romans were not\r\nonly willing, but very desirous, to grant those Jews in Jerusalem both\r\ntheir lives and their liberties, and to save both their city and their\r\ntemple. But the zealots, the robbers, and the seditious would hearken to\r\nno terms of submission. They voluntarily chose to reduce the citizens to\r\nthat extremity, as to force mothers to this unnatural barbarity, which,\r\nin all its circumstances, has not, I still suppose, been hitherto\r\nparalleled among the rest of mankind.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ These steps to the altar of burnt-offering seem here\r\neither an improper and inaccurate expression of Josephus, since it was\r\nunlawful to make ladder steps; [see description of the temples, ch. 13.,\r\nand note on Antiq.

See more especially the note on ch. 9. sect. 2. But one thing\r\nis here peculiarly remarkable, that Moses adds, Though they should be\r\n\"sold\" for slaves, yet \"no man should buy them;\" i.e. either they should\r\nhave none to redeem them from this sale into slavery; or rather, that\r\nthe slaves to be sold should be more than were the purchasers for them,\r\nand so they should be sold for little or nothing; which is what Josephus\r\nhere affirms to have been the case at this time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n29 (return) [ What became of these spoils of the temple that escaped the\r\nfire, see Josephus himself hereafter, B.

Nor\r\ncould there have been that number of Jews in Jerusalem to be destroyed\r\nin this siege, as will be presently set down by Josephus, but that both\r\nJews and proselytes of justice were just then come up out of the other\r\ncountries of Galilee, Samaria, Judea, and Perea and other remoter\r\nregions, to the passover, in vast numbers, and therein cooped up, as in\r\na prison, by the Roman army, as Josephus himself well observes in this\r\nand the next section, and as is exactly related elsewhere, B. V. ch. 3.\r\nsect. 1 and ch. 13. sect. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n33 (return) [ This number of a company for one paschal lamb, between\r\nten and twenty, agrees exactly with the number thirteen, at our Savior's\r\nlast passover.

This number ought to be here indeed just ten times the\r\nnumber of the lambs, or just 2,565,000, by Josephus's own reasoning;\r\nwhereas it is, in his present copies, no less than 2,700,000, which last\r\nnumber is, however, nearest the other number in the place now cited,\r\nwhich is 3,000,000. But what is here chiefly remarkable is this, that no\r\nforeign nation ever came thus to destroy the Jews at any of their solemn\r\nfestivals, from the days of Moses till this time, but came now upon\r\ntheir apostasy from God, and from obedience to him. Nor is it possible,\r\nin the nature of things, that in any other nation such vast numbers\r\nshould be gotten together, and perish in the siege of any one city\r\nwhatsoever, as now happened in Jerusalem.]\r\n\r\n\r\n34 (return) [ This is the proper place for such as have closely\r\nattended to these latter books of the War to peruse, and that with equal\r\nattention, those distinct and plain predictions of Jesus of Nazareth, in\r\nthe Gospels thereto relating, as compared with their exact completions\r\nin Josephus's history; upon which completions, as Dr. Whitby well\r\nobserves, Annot. on Matthew 24:2, no small part of the evidence for the\r\ntruth of the Christian religion does depend; and as I have step by\r\nstep compared them together in my Literal Accomplishment of Scripture\r\nProphecies. The reader is to observe further, that the true reason why I\r\nhave so seldom taken notice of those completions in the course of these\r\nnotes, notwithstanding their being so very remarkable, and frequently\r\nso very obvious, is this, that I had entirely prevented myself in that\r\ntreatise beforehand; to which therefore I must here, once for all,\r\nseriously refer every inquisitive reader. Besides these five here\r\nenumerated, who had taken Jerusalem of old, Josephus, upon further\r\nrecollection, reckons a sixth, Antiq. B. XII. ch. 1. sect. 1, who should\r\nhave been here inserted in the second place; I mean Ptolemy, the son of\r\nLagus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n35 (return) [ Why the great Bochart should say, [De Phoenic.

And for the word, or temple, as if it must needs\r\nbelong to the great temple built by Solomon long afterward, Josephus\r\nhimself uses, for the small tabernacle of Moses, Antiq. B.

Now as soon as the army had no more people to slay or to plunder,\r\nbecause there remained none to be the objects of their fury, [for they\r\nwould not have spared any, had there remained any other work to be\r\ndone,] Caesar gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city\r\nand temple, but should leave as many of the towers standing as were of\r\nthe greatest eminency; that is, Phasaelus, and Hippicus, and Mariamne;\r\nand so much of the wall as enclosed the city on the west side. This\r\nwall was spared, in order to afford a camp for such as were to lie in\r\ngarrison, as were the towers also spared, in order to demonstrate to\r\nposterity what kind of city it was, and how well fortified, which the\r\nRoman valor had subdued; but for all the rest of the wall, it was so\r\nthoroughly laid even with the ground by those that dug it up to the\r\nfoundation, that there was left nothing to make those that came thither\r\nbelieve it had ever been inhabited. This was the end which Jerusalem\r\ncame to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city\r\notherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind.\r\n\r\n2. But Caesar resolved to leave there, as a guard, the tenth legion,\r\nwith certain troops of horsemen, and companies of footmen. So, having\r\nentirely completed this war, he was desirous to commend his whole army,\r\non account of the great exploits they had performed, and to bestow\r\nproper rewards on such as had signalized themselves therein. He had\r\ntherefore a great tribunal made for him in the midst of the place\r\nwhere he had formerly encamped, and stood upon it with his principal\r\ncommanders about him, and spake so as to be heard by the whole army\r\nin the manner following: That he returned them abundance of thanks for\r\ntheir good-will which they had showed to him: he commended them for that\r\nready obedience they had exhibited in this whole war, which obedience\r\nhad appeared in the many and great dangers which they had courageously\r\nundergone; as also for that courage they had shown, and had thereby\r\naugmented of themselves their country's power, and had made it evident\r\nto all men, that neither the multitude of their enemies, nor the\r\nstrength of their places, nor the largeness of their cities, nor the\r\nrash boldness and brutish rage of their antagonists, were sufficient at\r\nany time to get clear of the Roman valor, although some of them may have\r\nfortune in many respects on their side. He said further, that it was\r\nbut reasonable for them to put an end to this war, now it had lasted\r\nso long, for that they had nothing better to wish for when they entered\r\ninto it; and that this happened more favorably for them, and more for\r\ntheir glory, that all the Romans had willingly accepted of those for\r\ntheir governors, and the curators of their dominions, whom they had\r\nchosen for them, and had sent into their own country for that purpose,\r\nwhich still continued under the management of those whom they had\r\npitched on, and were thankful to them for pitching upon them. That\r\naccordingly, although he did both admire and tenderly regard them all,\r\nbecause he knew that every one of them had gone as cheerfully about\r\ntheir work as their abilities and opportunities would give them leave;\r\nyet, he said, that he would immediately bestow rewards and dignities on\r\nthose that had fought the most bravely, and with greater force, and had\r\nsignalized their conduct in the most glorious manner, and had made his\r\narmy more famous by their noble exploits; and that no one who had\r\nbeen willing to take more pains than another should miss of a just\r\nretribution for the same; for that he had been exceeding careful about\r\nthis matter, and that the more, because he had much rather reward the\r\nvirtues of his fellow soldiers than punish such as had offended.\r\n\r\n3. Hereupon Titus ordered those whose business it was to read the list\r\nof all that had performed great exploits in this war, whom he called to\r\nhim by their names, and commended them before the company, and rejoiced\r\nin them in the same manner as a man would have rejoiced in his own\r\nexploits. He also put on their heads crowns of gold, and golden\r\nornaments about their necks, and gave them long spears of gold, and\r\nensigns that were made of silver, and removed every one of them to a\r\nhigher rank; and besides this, he plentifully distributed among them,\r\nout of the spoils, and the other prey they had taken, silver, and\r\ngold, and garments. So when they had all these honors bestowed on them,\r\naccording to his own appointment made to every one, and he had wished\r\nall sorts of happiness to the whole army, he came down, among the great\r\nacclamations which were made to him, and then betook himself to offer\r\nthank-offerings [to the gods], and at once sacrificed a vast number of\r\noxen, that stood ready at the altars, and distributed them among the\r\narmy to feast on. And when he had staid three days among the principal\r\ncommanders, and so long feasted with them, he sent away the rest of his\r\narmy to the several places where they would be every one best situated;\r\nbut permitted the tenth legion to stay, as a guard at Jerusalem, and did\r\nnot send them away beyond Euphrates, where they had been before. And as\r\nhe remembered that the twelfth legion had given way to the Jews, under\r\nCestius their general, he expelled them out of all Syria, for they\r\nhad lain formerly at Raphanea, and sent them away to a place called\r\nMeletine, near Euphrates, which is in the limits of Armenia and\r\nCappadocia; he also thought fit that two of the legions should stay with\r\nhim till he should go to Egypt. He then went down with his army to that\r\nCesarea which lay by the sea-side, and there laid up the rest of his\r\nspoils in great quantities, and gave order that the captives should be\r\nkept there; for the winter season hindered him then from sailing into\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Titus Exhibited All Sorts Of Shows At Cesarea Philippi.\r\n     Concerning Simon The Tyrant How He Was Taken, And Reserved\r\n     For The Triumph.\r\n\r\n1. Now at the same time that Titus Caesar lay at the siege of Jerusalem,\r\ndid Vespasian go on board a merchantship and sailed from Alexandria to\r\nRhodes; whence he sailed away in ships with three rows of oars; and\r\nas he touched at several cities that lay in his road, he was joyfully\r\nreceived by them all, and so passed over from Ionia into Greece; whence\r\nhe set sail from Corcyra to the promontory of Iapyx, whence he took his\r\njourney by land. But as for Titus, he marched from that Cesarea which\r\nlay by the sea-side, and came to that which is named Cesarea Philippi,\r\nand staid there a considerable time, and exhibited all sorts of shows\r\nthere. And here a great number of the captives were destroyed, some\r\nbeing thrown to wild beasts, and others in multitudes forced to kill one\r\nanother, as if they were their enemies. And here it was that Titus was\r\ninformed of the seizure of Simon the son of Gioras, which was made after\r\nthe manner following: This Simon, during the siege of Jerusalem, was in\r\nthe upper city; but when the Roman army was gotten within the walls,\r\nand were laying the city waste, he then took the most faithful of his\r\nfriends with him, and among them some that were stone-cutters, with\r\nthose iron tools which belonged to their occupation, and as great a\r\nquantity of provisions as would suffice them for a long time, and let\r\nhimself and all them down into a certain subterraneous cavern that was\r\nnot visible above ground. Now, so far as had been digged of old, they\r\nwent onward along it without disturbance; but where they met with solid\r\nearth, they dug a mine under ground, and this in hopes that they should\r\nbe able to proceed so far as to rise from under ground in a safe place,\r\nand by that means escape. But when they came to make the experiment,\r\nthey were disappointed of their hope; for the miners could make but\r\nsmall progress, and that with difficulty also; insomuch that their\r\nprovisions, though they distributed them by measure, began to fail\r\nthem. And now Simon, thinking he might be able to astonish and elude the\r\nRomans, put on a white frock, and buttoned upon him a purple cloak, and\r\nappeared out of the ground in the place where the temple had formerly\r\nbeen. At the first, indeed, those that saw him were greatly astonished,\r\nand stood still where they were; but afterward they came nearer to him,\r\nand asked him who he was. Now Simon would not tell them, but bid them\r\ncall for their captain; and when they ran to call him, Terentius Rufus\r\n2 who was left to command the army there, came to Simon, and learned of\r\nhim the whole truth, and kept him in bonds, and let Caesar know that he\r\nwas taken. Thus did God bring this man to be punished for what bitter\r\nand savage tyranny he had exercised against his countrymen by those who\r\nwere his worst enemies; and this while he was not subdued by violence,\r\nbut voluntarily delivered himself up to them to be punished, and that\r\non the very same account that he had laid false accusations against many\r\nJews, as if they were falling away to the Romans, and had barbarously\r\nslain them; for wicked actions do not escape the Divine anger, nor is\r\njustice too weak to punish offenders, but in time overtakes those that\r\ntransgress its laws, and inflicts its punishments upon the wicked in a\r\nmanner, so much more severe, as they expected to escape it on account of\r\ntheir not being punished immediately. 3 Simon was made sensible of this\r\nby falling under the indignation of the Romans. This rise of his out of\r\nthe ground did also occasion the discovery of a great number of others\r\nof the seditious at that time, who had hidden themselves under ground.\r\nBut for Simon, he was brought to Caesar in bonds, when he was come back\r\nto that Cesarea which was on the seaside, who gave orders that he should\r\nbe kept against that triumph which he was to celebrate at Rome upon this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Titus Upon The Celebration Of His Brothers And Fathers\r\n     Birthdays Had Many Of The Jews Slain. Concerning The Danger\r\n     The Jews Were In At Antioch, By Means Of The Transgression\r\n     And Impiety Of One Antiochus, A Jew.\r\n\r\n1. While Titus was at Cesarea, he solemnized the birthday of his brother\r\n[Domitian] after a splendid manner, and inflicted a great deal of the\r\npunishment intended for the Jews in honor of him; for the number of\r\nthose that were now slain in fighting with the beasts, and were burnt,\r\nand fought with one another, exceeded two thousand five hundred. Yet did\r\nall this seem to the Romans, when they were thus destroyed ten thousand\r\nseveral ways, to be a punishment beneath their deserts. After this\r\nCaesar came to Berytus, 4 which is a city of Phoenicia, and a Roman\r\ncolony, and staid there a longer time, and exhibited a still more\r\npompous solemnity about his father's birthday, both in the magnificence\r\nof the shows, and in the other vast expenses he was at in his devices\r\nthereto belonging; so that a great multitude of the captives were here\r\ndestroyed after the same manner as before.\r\n\r\n2. It happened also about this time, that the Jews who remained at\r\nAntioch were under accusations, and in danger of perishing, from the\r\ndisturbances that were raised against them by the Antiochians; and this\r\nboth on account of the slanders spread abroad at this time against them,\r\nand on account of what pranks they had played not long before; which\r\nI am obliged to describe without fail, though briefly, that I may the\r\nbetter connect my narration of future actions with those that went\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n3. For as the Jewish nation is widely dispersed over all the habitable\r\nearth among its inhabitants, so it is very much intermingled with\r\nSyria by reason of its neighborhood, and had the greatest multitudes in\r\nAntioch by reason of the largeness of the city, wherein the kings, after\r\nAntiochus, had afforded them a habitation with the most undisturbed\r\ntranquillity; for though Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, laid\r\nJerusalem waste, and spoiled the temple, yet did those that succeeded\r\nhim in the kingdom restore all the donations that were made of brass to\r\nthe Jews of Antioch, and dedicated them to their synagogue, and granted\r\nthem the enjoyment of equal privileges of citizens with the Greeks\r\nthemselves; and as the succeeding kings treated them after the same\r\nmanner, they both multiplied to a great number, and adorned their temple\r\ngloriously by fine ornaments, and with great magnificence, in the use of\r\nwhat had been given them. They also made proselytes of a great many of\r\nthe Greeks perpetually, and thereby after a sort brought them to be\r\na portion of their own body. But about this time when the present war\r\nbegan, and Vespasian was newly sailed to Syria, and all men had taken\r\nup a great hatred against the Jews, then it was that a certain person,\r\nwhose name was Antiochus, being one of the Jewish nation, and greatly\r\nrespected on account of his father, who was governor of the Jews at\r\nAntioch 5 came upon the theater at a time when the people of Antioch\r\nwere assembled together, and became an informer against his father, and\r\naccused both him and others that they had resolved to burn the whole\r\ncity in one night; he also delivered up to them some Jews that were\r\nforeigners, as partners in their resolutions. When the people heard\r\nthis, they could not refrain their passion, but commanded that those\r\nwho were delivered up to them should have fire brought to burn them, who\r\nwere accordingly all burnt upon the theater immediately. They did also\r\nfall violently upon the multitude of the Jews, as supposing that\r\nby punishing them suddenly they should save their own city. As for\r\nAntiochus, he aggravated the rage they were in, and thought to give them\r\na demonstration of his own conversion, arm of his hatred of the Jewish\r\ncustoms, by sacrificing after the manner of the Greeks; he persuaded\r\nthe rest also to compel them to do the same, because they would by that\r\nmeans discover who they were that had plotted against them, since they\r\nwould not do so; and when the people of Antioch tried the experiment,\r\nsome few complied, but those that would not do so were slain. As for\r\nAntiochus himself, he obtained soldiers from the Roman commander, and\r\nbecame a severe master over his own citizens, not permitting them to\r\nrest on the seventh day, but forcing them to do all that they usually\r\ndid on other days; and to that degree of distress did he reduce them in\r\nthis matter, that the rest of the seventh day was dissolved not only at\r\nAntioch, but the same thing which took thence its rise was done in other\r\ncities also, in like manner, for some small time.\r\n\r\n4. Now, after these misfortunes had happened to the Jews at Antioch, a\r\nsecond calamity befell them, the description of which when we were going\r\nabout we premised the account foregoing; for upon this accident, whereby\r\nthe four-square market-place was burnt down, as well as the archives,\r\nand the place where the public records were preserved, and the royal\r\npalaces, [and it was not without difficulty that the fire was then put\r\na stop to, which was likely, by the fury wherewith it was carried along,\r\nto have gone over the whole city,] Antiochus accused the Jews as the\r\noccasion of all the mischief that was done. Now this induced the people\r\nof Antioch, who were now under the immediate persuasion, by reason of\r\nthe disorder they were in, that this calumny was true, and would have\r\nbeen under the same persuasion, even though they had not borne\r\nan ill-will at the Jews before, to believe this man's accusation,\r\nespecially when they considered what had been done before, and this\r\nto such a degree, that they all fell violently upon those that were\r\naccused, and this, like madmen, in a very furious rage also, even as if\r\nthey had seen the Jews in a manner setting fire themselves to the city;\r\nnor was it without difficulty that one Cneius Collegas, the legate,\r\ncould prevail with them to permit the affairs to be laid before Caesar;\r\nfor as to Cesennius Petus, the president of Syria, Vespasian had already\r\nsent him away; and so it happened that he was not yet come back thither.\r\nBut when Collegas had made a careful inquiry into the matter, he found\r\nout the truth, and that not one of those Jews that were accused by\r\nAntiochus had any hand in it, but that all was done by some vile persons\r\ngreatly in debt, who supposed that if they could once set fire to the\r\nmarket-place, and burn the public records, they should have no further\r\ndemands made upon them. So the Jews were under great disorder and\r\nterror, in the uncertain expectations of what would be the upshot of\r\nthese accusations against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How Vespasian Was Received At Rome; As Also How The Germans\r\n     Revolted From The Romans, But Were Subdued. That The\r\n     Sarmatians Overran Mysia, But Were Compelled To Retire To\r\n     Their Own Country Again.\r\n\r\n1. And now Titus Caesar, upon the news that was brought him concerning\r\nhis father, that his coming was much desired by all the Italian cities,\r\nand that Rome especially received him with great alacrity and splendor,\r\nbetook himself to rejoicing and pleasures to a great degree, as now\r\nfreed from the solicitude he had been under, after the most agreeable\r\nmanner. For all men that were in Italy showed their respects to him\r\nin their minds before he came thither, as if he were already come, as\r\nesteeming the very expectation they had of him to be his real presence,\r\non account of the great desires they had to see him, and because the\r\ngood-will they bore him was entirely free and unconstrained; for it was,\r\ndesirable thing to the senate, who well remembered the calamities they\r\nhad undergone in the late changes of their governors, to receive a\r\ngovernor who was adorned with the gravity of old age, and with the\r\nhighest skill in the actions of war, whose advancement would be, as they\r\nknew, for nothing else but for the preservation of those that were to\r\nbe governed. Moreover, the people had been so harassed by their civil\r\nmiseries, that they were still more earnest for his coming immediately,\r\nas supposing they should then be firmly delivered from their calamities,\r\nand believed they should then recover their secure tranquillity and\r\nprosperity; and for the soldiery, they had the principal regard to him,\r\nfor they were chiefly apprized of his great exploits in war; and since\r\nthey had experienced the want of skill and want of courage in other\r\ncommanders, they were very desirous to be free from that great shame\r\nthey had undergone by their means, and heartily wished to receive such\r\na prince as might be a security and an ornament to them. And as this\r\ngood-will to Vespasian was universal, those that enjoyed any remarkable\r\ndignities could not have patience enough to stay in Rome, but made haste\r\nto meet him at a very great distance from it; nay, indeed, none of the\r\nrest could endure the delay of seeing him, but did all pour out of the\r\ncity in such crowds, and were so universally possessed with the opinion\r\nthat it was easier and better for them to go out than to stay there,\r\nthat this was the very first time that the city joyfully perceived\r\nitself almost empty of its citizens; for those that staid within were\r\nfewer than those that went out. But as soon as the news was come that he\r\nwas hard by, and those that had met him at first related with what good\r\nhumor he received every one that came to him, then it was that the whole\r\nmultitude that had remained in the city, with their wives and children,\r\ncame into the road, and waited for him there; and for those whom he\r\npassed by, they made all sorts of acclamations, on account of the joy\r\nthey had to see him, and the pleasantness of his countenance, and styled\r\nhim their Benefactor and Savior, and the only person who was worthy to\r\nbe ruler of the city of Rome. And now the city was like a temple, full\r\nof garlands and sweet odors; nor was it easy for him to come to the\r\nroyal palace, for the multitude of the people that stood about him,\r\nwhere yet at last he performed his sacrifices of thanksgiving to his\r\nhousehold gods for his safe return to the city. The multitude did also\r\nbetake themselves to feasting; which feasts and drink-offerings they\r\ncelebrated by their tribes, and their families, and their neighborhoods,\r\nand still prayed God to grant that Vespasian, his sons, and all their\r\nposterity, might continue in the Roman government for a very long time,\r\nand that his dominion might be preserved from all opposition. And this\r\nwas the manner in which Rome so joyfully received Vespasian, and thence\r\ngrew immediately into a state of great prosperity.\r\n\r\n2. But before this time, and while Vespasian was about Alexandria, and\r\nTitus was lying at the siege of Jerusalem, a great multitude of the\r\nGermans were in commotion, and tended to rebellion; and as the Gauls in\r\ntheir neighborhood joined with them, they conspired together, and had\r\nthereby great hopes of success, and that they should free themselves\r\nfrom the dominion of the Romans. The motives that induced the Germans to\r\nthis attempt for a revolt, and for beginning the war, were these: In\r\nthe first place, the nature [of the people], which was destitute of just\r\nreasonings, and ready to throw themselves rashly into danger, upon small\r\nhopes; in the next place, the hatred they bore to those that were their\r\ngovernors, while their nation had never been conscious of subjection\r\nto any but to the Romans, and that by compulsion only. Besides these\r\nmotives, it was the opportunity that now offered itself, which above\r\nall the rest prevailed with them so to do; for when they saw the Roman\r\ngovernment in a great internal disorder, by the continual changes of its\r\nrulers, and understood that every part of the habitable earth under them\r\nwas in an unsettled and tottering condition, they thought this was\r\nthe best opportunity that could afford itself for themselves to make a\r\nsedition, when the state of the Romans was so ill. Classicus 6 also,\r\nand Vitellius, two of their commanders, puffed them up with such hopes.\r\nThese had for a long time been openly desirous of such an innovation,\r\nand were induced by the present opportunity to venture upon the\r\ndeclaration of their sentiments; the multitude was also ready; and when\r\nthese men told them of what they intended to attempt, that news was\r\ngladly received by them. So when a great part of the Germans had agreed\r\nto rebel, and the rest were no better disposed, Vespasian, as guided by\r\nDivine Providence, sent letters to Petilius Cerealis, who had formerly\r\nhad the command of Germany, whereby he declared him to have the dignity\r\nof consul, and commanded him to take upon him the government of Britain;\r\nso he went whither he was ordered to go, and when he was informed of\r\nthe revolt of the Germans, he fell upon them as soon as they were gotten\r\ntogether, and put his army in battle-array, and slew a great number of\r\nthem in the fight, and forced them to leave off their madness, and to\r\ngrow wiser; nay, had he not fallen thus suddenly upon them on the\r\nplace, it had not been long ere they would however have been brought\r\nto punishment; for as soon as ever the news of their revolt was come to\r\nRome, and Caesar Domitian was made acquainted with it, he made no delay,\r\neven at that his age, when he was exceeding young, but undertook this\r\nweighty affair. He had a courageous mind from his father, and had\r\nmade greater improvements than belonged to such an age: accordingly\r\nhe marched against the barbarians immediately; whereupon their hearts\r\nfailed them at the very rumor of his approach, and they submitted\r\nthemselves to him with fear, and thought it a happy thing that they\r\nwere brought under their old yoke again without suffering any further\r\nmischiefs. When therefore Domitian had settled all the affairs of Gaul\r\nin such good order, that it would not be easily put into disorder any\r\nmore, he returned to Rome with honor and glory, as having performed such\r\nexploits as were above his own age, but worthy of so great a father.\r\n\r\n3. At the very same time with the forementioned revolt of the Germans\r\ndid the bold attempt of the Scythians against the Romans occur; for\r\nthose Scythians who are called Sarmatians, being a very numerous\r\npeople, transported themselves over the Danube into Mysia, without\r\nbeing perceived; after which, by their violence, and entirely unexpected\r\nassault, they slew a great many of the Romans that guarded the\r\nfrontiers; and as the consular legate Fonteius Agrippa came to meet\r\nthem, and fought courageously against them, he was slain by them. They\r\nthen overran all the region that had been subject to him, tearing and\r\nrending every thing that fell in their way. But when Vespasian was\r\ninformed of what had happened, and how Mysia was laid waste, he sent\r\naway Rubrius Gallus to punish these Sarmatians; by whose means many of\r\nthem perished in the battles he fought against them, and that part which\r\nescaped fled with fear to their own country. So when this general\r\nhad put an end to the war, he provided for the future security of the\r\ncountry also; for he placed more and more numerous garrisons in the\r\nplace, till he made it altogether impossible for the barbarians to\r\npass over the river any more. And thus had this war in Mysia a sudden\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning The Sabbatic River Which Titus Saw As He Was\r\n     Journeying Through Syria; And How The People Of Antioch Came\r\n     With A Petition To Titus Against The Jews But Were Rejected\r\n     By Him; As Also Concerning Titus's And Vespasian's Triumph.\r\n\r\n1. Now Titus Caesar tarried some time at Berytus, as we told you before.\r\nHe thence removed, and exhibited magnificent shows in all those cities\r\nof Syria through which he went, and made use of the captive Jews as\r\npublic instances of the destruction of that nation. He then saw a\r\nriver as he went along, of such a nature as deserves to be recorded in\r\nhistory; it runs in the middle between Arcea, belonging to Agrippa's\r\nkingdom, and Raphanea. It hath somewhat very peculiar in it; for when\r\nit runs, its current is strong, and has plenty of water; after which its\r\nsprings fail for six days together, and leave its channel dry, as any\r\none may see; after which days it runs on the seventh day as it did\r\nbefore, and as though it had undergone no change at all; it hath also\r\nbeen observed to keep this order perpetually and exactly; whence it is\r\nthat they call it the Sabbatic River 7 that name being taken from the\r\nsacred seventh day among the Jews.\r\n\r\n2. But when the people of Antioch were informed that Titus was\r\napproaching, they were so glad at it, that they could not keep within\r\ntheir walls, but hasted away to give him the meeting; nay, they\r\nproceeded as far as thirty furlongs, and more, with that intention.\r\nThese were not the men only, but a multitude of women also with their\r\nchildren did the same; and when they saw him coming up to them, they\r\nstood on both sides of the way, and stretched out their right hands,\r\nsaluting him, and making all sorts of acclamations to him, and turned\r\nback together with him. They also, among all the acclamations they made\r\nto him, besought him all the way they went to eject the Jews out of\r\ntheir city; yet did not Titus at all yield to this their petition, but\r\ngave them the bare hearing of it quietly. However, the Jews were in a\r\ngreat deal of terrible fear, under the uncertainty they were in what\r\nhis opinion was, and what he would do to them. For Titus did not stay\r\nat Antioch, but continued his progress immediately to Zeugma, which lies\r\nupon the Euphrates, whither came to him messengers from Vologeses king\r\nof Parthia, and brought him a crown of gold upon the victory he had\r\ngained over the Jews; which he accepted of, and feasted the king's\r\nmessengers, and then came back to Antioch. And when the senate and\r\npeople of Antioch earnestly entreated him to come upon their theater,\r\nwhere their whole multitude was assembled, and expected him, he complied\r\nwith great humanity; but when they pressed him with much earnestness,\r\nand continually begged of him that he would eject the Jews out of their\r\ncity, he gave them this very pertinent answer: \"How can this be done,\r\nsince that country of theirs, whither the Jews must be obliged then to\r\nretire, is destroyed, and no place will receive them besides?\" Whereupon\r\nthe people of Antioch, when they had failed of success in this their\r\nfirst request, made him a second; for they desired that he would order\r\nthose tables of brass to be removed on which the Jews' privileges were\r\nengraven. However, Titus would not grant that neither, but permitted the\r\nJews of Antioch to continue to enjoy the very same privileges in that\r\ncity which they had before, and then departed for Egypt; and as he came\r\nto Jerusalem in his progress, and compared the melancholy condition he\r\nsaw it then in, with the ancient glory of the city, and called to mind\r\nthe greatness of its present ruins, as well as its ancient splendor,\r\nhe could not but pity the destruction of the city, so far was he from\r\nboasting that so great and goodly a city as that was had been by him\r\ntaken by force; nay, he frequently cursed those that had been the\r\nauthors of their revolt, and had brought such a punishment upon the\r\ncity; insomuch that it openly appeared that he did not desire that\r\nsuch a calamity as this punishment of theirs amounted to should be a\r\ndemonstration of his courage. Yet was there no small quantity of the\r\nriches that had been in that city still found among its ruins, a great\r\ndeal of which the Romans dug up; but the greatest part was discovered\r\nby those who were captives, and so they carried it away; I mean the gold\r\nand the silver, and the rest of that most precious furniture which the\r\nJews had, and which the owners had treasured up under ground, against\r\nthe uncertain fortunes of war.\r\n\r\n3. So Titus took the journey he intended into Egypt, and passed over the\r\ndesert very suddenly, and came to Alexandria, and took up a resolution\r\nto go to Rome by sea. And as he was accompanied by two legions, he sent\r\neach of them again to the places whence they had before come; the fifth\r\nhe sent to Mysia, and the fifteenth to Pannonia: as for the leaders of\r\nthe captives, Simon and John, with the other seven hundred men, whom\r\nhe had selected out of the rest as being eminently tall and handsome\r\nof body, he gave order that they should be soon carried to Italy,\r\nas resolving to produce them in his triumph. So when he had had a\r\nprosperous voyage to his mind, the city of Rome behaved itself in his\r\nreception, and their meeting him at a distance, as it did in the case\r\nof his father. But what made the most splendid appearance in Titus's\r\nopinion was, when his father met him, and received him; but still the\r\nmultitude of the citizens conceived the greatest joy when they saw\r\nthem all three together, 8 as they did at this time; nor were many days\r\noverpast when they determined to have but one triumph, that should be\r\ncommon to both of them, on account of the glorious exploits they had\r\nperformed, although the senate had decreed each of them a separate\r\ntriumph by himself. So when notice had been given beforehand of the day\r\nappointed for this pompous solemnity to be made, on account of their\r\nvictories, not one of the immense multitude was left in the city, but\r\nevery body went out so far as to gain only a station where they might\r\nstand, and left only such a passage as was necessary for those that were\r\nto be seen to go along it.\r\n\r\n4. Now all the soldiery marched out beforehand by companies, and in\r\ntheir several ranks, under their several commanders, in the night time,\r\nand were about the gates, not of the upper palaces, but those near\r\nthe temple of Isis; for there it was that the emperors had rested the\r\nforegoing night. And as soon as ever it was day, Vespasian and Titus\r\ncame out crowned with laurel, and clothed in those ancient purple habits\r\nwhich were proper to their family, and then went as far as Octavian's\r\nWalks; for there it was that the senate, and the principal rulers, and\r\nthose that had been recorded as of the equestrian order, waited for\r\nthem. Now a tribunal had been erected before the cloisters, and ivory\r\nchairs had been set upon it, when they came and sat down upon them.\r\nWhereupon the soldiery made an acclamation of joy to them immediately,\r\nand all gave them attestations of their valor; while they were\r\nthemselves without their arms, and only in their silken garments, and\r\ncrowned with laurel: then Vespasian accepted of these shouts of theirs;\r\nbut while they were still disposed to go on in such acclamations, he\r\ngave them a signal of silence. And when every body entirely held their\r\npeace, he stood up, and covering the greatest part of his head with his\r\ncloak, he put up the accustomed solemn prayers; the like prayers did\r\nTitus put up also; after which prayers Vespasian made a short speech to\r\nall the people, and then sent away the soldiers to a dinner prepared for\r\nthem by the emperors. Then did he retire to that gate which was called\r\nthe Gate of the Pomp, because pompous shows do always go through that\r\ngate; there it was that they tasted some food, and when they had put on\r\ntheir triumphal garments, and had offered sacrifices to the gods that\r\nwere placed at the gate, they sent the triumph forward, and marched\r\nthrough the theatres, that they might be the more easily seen by the\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\n5. Now it is impossible to describe the multitude of the shows as they\r\ndeserve, and the magnificence of them all; such indeed as a man could\r\nnot easily think of as performed, either by the labor of workmen, or\r\nthe variety of riches, or the rarities of nature; for almost all such\r\ncuriosities as the most happy men ever get by piece-meal were here one\r\nheaped on another, and those both admirable and costly in their nature;\r\nand all brought together on that day demonstrated the vastness of the\r\ndominions of the Romans; for there was here to be seen a mighty quantity\r\nof silver, and gold, and ivory, contrived into all sorts of things, and\r\ndid not appear as carried along in pompous show only, but, as a man may\r\nsay, running along like a river. Some parts were composed of the rarest\r\npurple hangings, and so carried along; and others accurately represented\r\nto the life what was embroidered by the arts of the Babylonians. There\r\nwere also precious stones that were transparent, some set in crowns of\r\ngold, and some in other places, as the workmen pleased; and of these\r\nsuch a vast number were brought, that we could not but thence learn how\r\nvainly we imagined any of them to be rarities. The images of the gods\r\nwere also carried, being as well wonderful for their largeness, as made\r\nvery artificially, and with great skill of the workmen; nor were any of\r\nthese images of any other than very costly materials; and many species\r\nof animals were brought, every one in their own natural ornaments. The\r\nmen also who brought every one of these shows were great multitudes, and\r\nadorned with purple garments, all over interwoven with gold; those that\r\nwere chosen for carrying these pompous shows having also about them such\r\nmagnificent ornaments as were both extraordinary and surprising. Besides\r\nthese, one might see that even the great number of the captives was not\r\nunadorned, while the variety that was in their garments, and their fine\r\ntexture, concealed from the sight the deformity of their bodies. But\r\nwhat afforded the greatest surprise of all was the structure of the\r\npageants that were borne along; for indeed he that met them could\r\nnot but be afraid that the bearers would not be able firmly enough to\r\nsupport them, such was their magnitude; for many of them were so made,\r\nthat they were on three or even four stories, one above another. The\r\nmagnificence also of their structure afforded one both pleasure and\r\nsurprise; for upon many of them were laid carpets of gold. There\r\nwas also wrought gold and ivory fastened about them all; and many\r\nresemblances of the war, and those in several ways, and variety of\r\ncontrivances, affording a most lively portraiture of itself. For there\r\nwas to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of\r\nenemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were carried into\r\ncaptivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown and\r\nruined by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the\r\nwalls of most populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and\r\nan army pouring itself within the walls; as also every place full of\r\nslaughter, and supplications of the enemies, when they were no longer\r\nable to lift up their hands in way of opposition. Fire also sent upon\r\ntemples was here represented, and houses overthrown, and falling upon\r\ntheir owners: rivers also, after they came out of a large and melancholy\r\ndesert, ran down, not into a land cultivated, nor as drink for men, or\r\nfor cattle, but through a land still on fire upon every side; for the\r\nJews related that such a thing they had undergone during this war. Now\r\nthe workmanship of these representations was so magnificent and lively\r\nin the construction of the things, that it exhibited what had been done\r\nto such as did not see it, as if they had been there really present. On\r\nthe top of every one of these pageants was placed the commander of the\r\ncity that was taken, and the manner wherein he was taken. Moreover,\r\nthere followed those pageants a great number of ships; and for the other\r\nspoils, they were carried in great plenty. But for those that were taken\r\nin the temple of Jerusalem, 9 they made the greatest figure of them\r\nall; that is, the golden table, of the weight of many talents; the\r\ncandlestick also, that was made of gold, though its construction were\r\nnow changed from that which we made use of; for its middle shaft was\r\nfixed upon a basis, and the small branches were produced out of it to\r\na great length, having the likeness of a trident in their position, and\r\nhad every one a socket made of brass for a lamp at the tops of them.\r\nThese lamps were in number seven, and represented the dignity of the\r\nnumber seven among the Jews; and the last of all the spoils, was carried\r\nthe Law of the Jews. After these spoils passed by a great many men,\r\ncarrying the images of Victory, whose structure was entirely either of\r\nivory or of gold. After which Vespasian marched in the first place,\r\nand Titus followed him; Domitian also rode along with them, and made a\r\nglorious appearance, and rode on a horse that was worthy of admiration.\r\n\r\n6. Now the last part of this pompous show was at the temple of Jupiter\r\nCapitolinus, whither when they were come, they stood still; for it was\r\nthe Romans' ancient custom to stay till somebody brought the news that\r\nthe general of the enemy was slain. This general was Simon, the son of\r\nGioras, who had then been led in this triumph among the captives; a rope\r\nhad also been put upon his head, and he had been drawn into a proper\r\nplace in the forum, and had withal been tormented by those that drew him\r\nalong; and the law of the Romans required that malefactors condemned to\r\ndie should be slain there. Accordingly, when it was related that there\r\nwas an end of him, and all the people had set up a shout for joy, they\r\nthen began to offer those sacrifices which they had consecrated, in the\r\nprayers used in such solemnities; which when they had finished, they\r\nwent away to the palace. And as for some of the spectators, the emperors\r\nentertained them at their own feast; and for all the rest there were\r\nnoble preparations made for feasting at home; for this was a festival\r\nday to the city of Rome, as celebrated for the victory obtained by their\r\narmy over their enemies, for the end that was now put to their civil\r\nmiseries, and for the commencement of their hopes of future prosperity\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\n7. After these triumphs were over, and after the affairs of the Romans\r\nwere settled on the surest foundations, Vespasian resolved to build\r\na temple to Peace, which was finished in so short a time, and in so\r\nglorious a manner, as was beyond all human expectation and opinion: for\r\nhe having now by Providence a vast quantity of wealth, besides what he\r\nhad formerly gained in his other exploits, he had this temple adorned\r\nwith pictures and statues; for in this temple were collected and\r\ndeposited all such rarities as men aforetime used to wander all over the\r\nhabitable world to see, when they had a desire to see one of them after\r\nanother; he also laid up therein those golden vessels and instruments\r\nthat were taken out of the Jewish temple, as ensigns of his glory. But\r\nstill he gave order that they should lay up their Law, and the purple\r\nveils of the holy place, in the royal palace itself, and keep them\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning Machaerus, And How Lucilius Bassus Took That\r\n     Citadel, And Other Places.\r\n\r\n1. Now Lucilius Bassus was sent as legate into Judea, and there he\r\nreceived the army from Cerealis Vitellianus, and took that citadel which\r\nwas in Herodium, together with the garrison that was in it; after which\r\nhe got together all the soldiery that was there, [which was a large\r\nbody, but dispersed into several parties,] with the tenth legion, and\r\nresolved to make war upon Machaerus; for it was highly necessary that\r\nthis citadel should be demolished, lest it might be a means of drawing\r\naway many into a rebellion, by reason of its strength; for the nature\r\nof the place was very capable of affording the surest hopes of safety to\r\nthose that possessed it, as well as delay and fear to those that should\r\nattack it; for what was walled in was itself a very rocky hill, elevated\r\nto a very great height; which circumstance alone made it very hard to be\r\nsubdued. It was also so contrived by nature, that it could not be easily\r\nascended; for it is, as it were, ditched about with such valleys on all\r\nsides, and to such a depth, that the eye cannot reach their bottoms,\r\nand such as are not easily to be passed over, and even such as it is\r\nimpossible to fill up with earth. For that valley which cuts it on the\r\nwest extends to threescore furlongs, and did not end till it came to the\r\nlake Asphaltites; on the same side it was also that Machaerus had\r\nthe tallest top of its hill elevated above the rest. But then for the\r\nvalleys that lay on the north and south sides, although they be not\r\nso large as that already described, yet it is in like manner an\r\nimpracticable thing to think of getting over them; and for the valley\r\nthat lies on the east side, its depth is found to be no less than a\r\nhundred cubits. It extends as far as a mountain that lies over against\r\nMachaerus, with which it is bounded.\r\n\r\n2. Now when Alexander [Janneus], the king of the Jews, observed the\r\nnature of this place, he was the first who built a citadel here,\r\nwhich afterwards was demolished by Gabinius, when he made war against\r\nAristobulus. But when Herod came to be king, he thought the place to\r\nbe worthy of the utmost regard, and of being built upon in the firmest\r\nmanner, and this especially because it lay so near to Arabia; for it is\r\nseated in a convenient place on that account, and hath a prospect toward\r\nthat country; he therefore surrounded a large space of ground with walls\r\nand towers, and built a city there, out of which city there was a way\r\nthat led up to the very citadel itself on the top of the mountain; nay,\r\nmore than this, he built a wall round that top of the hill, and erected\r\ntowers at the corners, of a hundred and sixty cubits high; in the middle\r\nof which place he built a palace, after a magnificent manner, wherein\r\nwere large and beautiful edifices. He also made a great many reservoirs\r\nfor the reception of water, that there might be plenty of it ready\r\nfor all uses, and those in the properest places that were afforded him\r\nthere. Thus did he, as it were, contend with the nature of the place,\r\nthat he might exceed its natural strength and security [which yet itself\r\nrendered it hard to be taken] by those fortifications which were made by\r\nthe hands of men. Moreover, he put a large quantity of darts and other\r\nmachines of war into it, and contrived to get every thing thither that\r\nmight any way contribute to its inhabitants' security, under the longest\r\nsiege possible.\r\n\r\n3. Now within this place there grew a sort of rue 10 that deserves our\r\nwonder on account of its largeness, for it was no way inferior to any\r\nfig tree whatsoever, either in height or in thickness; and the report\r\nis, that it had lasted ever since the times of Herod, and would probably\r\nhave lasted much longer, had it not been cut down by those Jews who\r\ntook possession of the place afterward. But still in that valley which\r\nencompasses the city on the north side there is a certain place called\r\nBaaras, which produces a root of the same name with itself 11 its\r\ncolor is like to that of flame, and towards the evenings it sends out a\r\ncertain ray like lightning. It is not easily taken by such as would\r\ndo it, but recedes from their hands, nor will yield itself to be taken\r\nquietly, until either the urine of a woman, or her menstrual blood, be\r\npoured upon it; nay, even then it is certain death to those that touch\r\nit, unless any one take and hang the root itself down from his hand,\r\nand so carry it away. It may also be taken another way, without danger,\r\nwhich is this: they dig a trench quite round about it, till the hidden\r\npart of the root be very small, they then tie a dog to it, and when the\r\ndog tries hard to follow him that tied him, this root is easily plucked\r\nup, but the dog dies immediately, as if it were instead of the man that\r\nwould take the plant away; nor after this need any one be afraid of\r\ntaking it into their hands. Yet, after all this pains in getting, it\r\nis only valuable on account of one virtue it hath, that if it be only\r\nbrought to sick persons, it quickly drives away those called demons,\r\nwhich are no other than the spirits of the wicked, that enter into men\r\nthat are alive and kill them, unless they can obtain some help against\r\nthem. Here are also fountains of hot water, that flow out of this place,\r\nwhich have a very different taste one from the other; for some of them\r\nare bitter, and others of them are plainly sweet. Here are also many\r\neruptions of cold waters, and this not only in the places that lie\r\nlower, and have their fountains near one another, but, what is still\r\nmore wonderful, here is to be seen a certain cave hard by, whose cavity\r\nis not deep, but it is covered over by a rock that is prominent; above\r\nthis rock there stand up two [hills or] breasts, as it were, but a\r\nlittle distant one from another, the one of which sends out a fountain\r\nthat is very cold, and the other sends out one that is very hot; which\r\nwaters, when they are mingled together, compose a most pleasant bath;\r\nthey are medicinal indeed for other maladies, but especially good for\r\nstrengthening the nerves. This place has in it also mines of sulfur and\r\nalum.\r\n\r\n4. Now when Bassus had taken a full view of this place, he resolved to\r\nbesiege it, by filling up the valley that lay on the east side; so he\r\nfell hard to work, and took great pains to raise his banks as soon as\r\npossible, and by that means to render the siege easy. As for the Jews\r\nthat were caught in this place, they separated themselves from the\r\nstrangers that were with them, and they forced those strangers, as an\r\notherwise useless multitude, to stay in the lower part of the city, and\r\nundergo the principal dangers, while they themselves seized on the upper\r\ncitadel, and held it, and this both on account of its strength, and to\r\nprovide for their own safety. They also supposed they might obtain their\r\npardon, in case they should [at last] surrender the citadel. However,\r\nthey were willing to make trial, in the first place, whether the\r\nhopes they had of avoiding a siege would come to any thing; with which\r\nintention they made sallies every day, and fought with those that met\r\nthem; in which conflicts they were many of them slain, as they therein\r\nslew many of the Romans. But still it was the opportunities that\r\npresented themselves which chiefly gained both sides their victories;\r\nthese were gained by the Jews, when they fell upon the Romans as they\r\nwere off their guard; but by the Romans, when, upon the others' sallies\r\nagainst their banks, they foresaw their coming, and were upon their\r\nguard when they received them. But the conclusion of this siege did\r\nnot depend upon these bickerings; but a certain surprising accident,\r\nrelating to what was done in this siege, forced the Jews to surrender\r\nthe citadel. There was a certain young man among the besieged, of great\r\nboldness, and very active of his hand, his name was Eleazar; he greatly\r\nsignalized himself in those sallies, and encouraged the Jews to go out\r\nin great numbers, in order to hinder the raising of the banks, and did\r\nthe Romans a vast deal of mischief when they came to fighting; he so\r\nmanaged matters, that those who sallied out made their attacks easily,\r\nand returned back without danger, and this by still bringing up the rear\r\nhimself. Now it happened that, on a certain time, when the fight was\r\nover, and both sides were parted, and retired home, he, in way of\r\ncontempt of the enemy, and thinking that none of them would begin the\r\nfight again at that time, staid without the gates, and talked with those\r\nthat were upon the wall, and his mind was wholly intent upon what they\r\nsaid. Now a certain person belonging to the Roman camp, whose name was\r\nRufus, by birth an Egyptian, ran upon him suddenly, when nobody expected\r\nsuch a thing, and carried him off, with his armor itself; while, in the\r\nmean time, those that saw it from the wall were under such an amazement,\r\nthat Rufus prevented their assistance, and carried Eleazar to the Roman\r\ncamp. So the general of the Romans ordered that he should be taken up\r\nnaked, set before the city to be seen, and sorely whipped before their\r\neyes. Upon this sad accident that befell the young man, the Jews were\r\nterribly confounded, and the city, with one voice, sorely lamented him,\r\nand the mourning proved greater than could well be supposed upon the\r\ncalamity of a single person. When Bassus perceived that, he began\r\nto think of using a stratagem against the enemy, and was desirous to\r\naggravate their grief, in order to prevail with them to surrender the\r\ncity for the preservation of that man. Nor did he fail of his hope; for\r\nhe commanded them to set up a cross, as if he were just going to hang\r\nEleazar upon it immediately; the sight of this occasioned a sore grief\r\namong those that were in the citadel, and they groaned vehemently, and\r\ncried out that they could not bear to see him thus destroyed. Whereupon\r\nEleazar besought them not to disregard him, now he was going to suffer a\r\nmost miserable death, and exhorted them to save themselves, by yielding\r\nto the Roman power and good fortune, since all other people were now\r\nconquered by them. These men were greatly moved with what he said, there\r\nbeing also many within the city that interceded for him, because he was\r\nof an eminent and very numerous family; so they now yielded to their\r\npassion of commiseration, contrary to their usual custom. Accordingly,\r\nthey sent out immediately certain messengers, and treated with the\r\nRomans, in order to a surrender of the citadel to them, and desired that\r\nthey might be permitted to go away, and take Eleazar along with them.\r\nThen did the Romans and their general accept of these terms; while the\r\nmultitude of strangers that were in the lower part of the city, hearing\r\nof the agreement that was made by the Jews for themselves alone, were\r\nresolved to fly away privately in the night time; but as soon as they\r\nhad opened their gates, those that had come to terms with Bassus told\r\nhim of it; whether it were that they envied the others' deliverance,\r\nor whether it were done out of fear, lest an occasion should be taken\r\nagainst them upon their escape, is uncertain. The most courageous,\r\ntherefore, of those men that went out prevented the enemy, and got away,\r\nand fled for it; but for those men that were caught within they were\r\nslain to the number of one thousand seven hundred, as were the women and\r\nchildren made slaves. But as Bassus thought he must perform the covenant\r\nhe had made with those that surrendered the citadel, he let them go, and\r\nrestored Eleazar to them.\r\n\r\n5. When Bassus had settled these affairs, he marched hastily to the\r\nforest of Jarden, as it is called; for he had heard that a great many\r\nof those that had fled from Jerusalem and Machaerus formerly were there\r\ngotten together. When he was therefore come to the place, and understood\r\nthat the former news was no mistake, he, in the first place, surrounded\r\nthe whole place with his horsemen, that such of the Jews as had boldness\r\nenough to try to break through might have no way possible for escaping,\r\nby reason of the situation of these horsemen; and for the footmen, he\r\nordered them to cut down the trees that were in the wood whither\r\nthey were fled. So the Jews were under a necessity of performing some\r\nglorious exploit, and of greatly exposing themselves in a battle, since\r\nthey might perhaps thereby escape. So they made a general attack, and\r\nwith a great shout fell upon those that surrounded them, who received\r\nthem with great courage; and so while the one side fought desperately,\r\nand the others would not yield, the fight was prolonged on that account.\r\nBut the event of the battle did not answer the expectation of the\r\nassailants; for so it happened, that no more than twelve fell on the\r\nRoman side, with a few that were wounded; but not one of the Jews\r\nescaped out of this battle, but they were all killed, being in the whole\r\nnot fewer in number than three thousand, together with Judas, the son\r\nof Jairus, their general, concerning whom we have before spoken, that he\r\nhad been a captain of a certain band at the siege of Jerusalem, and by\r\ngoing down into a certain vault under ground, had privately made his\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n6. About the same time it was that Caesar sent a letter to Bassus, and\r\nto Liberius Maximus, who was the procurator [of Judea], and gave order\r\nthat all Judea should be exposed to sale 12 for he did not found any\r\ncity there, but reserved the country for himself. However, he assigned\r\na place for eight hundred men only, whom he had dismissed from his army,\r\nwhich he gave them for their habitation; it is called Emmaus, 13 and is\r\ndistant from Jerusalem threescore furlongs. He also laid a tribute upon\r\nthe Jews wheresoever they were, and enjoined every one of them to bring\r\ntwo drachmae every year into the Capitol, as they used to pay the same\r\nto the temple at Jerusalem. And this was the state of the Jewish affairs\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning The Calamity That Befell Antiochus, King Of\r\n     Commagene. As Also Concerning The Alans And What Great\r\n     Mischiefs They Did To The Medes And Armenians.\r\n\r\n1. And now, in the fourth year of the reign of Vespasian, it came to\r\npass that Antiochus, the king of Commagene, with all his family, fell\r\ninto very great calamities. The occasion was this: Cesennius Petus, who\r\nwas president of Syria at this time, whether it were done out of regard\r\nto truth, or whether out of hatred to Antiochus, [for which was the real\r\nmotive was never thoroughly discovered,] sent an epistle to Caesar, and\r\ntherein told him that Antiochus, with his son Epiphanes, had resolved to\r\nrebel against the Romans, and had made a league with the king of Parthia\r\nto that purpose; that it was therefore fit to prevent them, lest they\r\nprevent us, and begin such a war as may cause a general disturbance in\r\nthe Roman empire. Now Caesar was disposed to take some care about the\r\nmatter, since this discovery was made; for the neighborhood of the\r\nkingdoms made this affair worthy of greater regard; for Samoseta, the\r\ncapital of Commagene, lies upon Euphrates, and upon any such design\r\ncould afford an easy passage over it to the Parthians, and could also\r\nafford them a secure reception. Petus was accordingly believed, and had\r\nauthority given him of doing what he should think proper in the case; so\r\nhe set about it without delay, and fell upon Commagene before Antiochus\r\nand his people had the least expectation of his coming: he had with him\r\nthe tenth legion, as also some cohorts and troops of horsemen. These\r\nkings also came to his assistance: Aristobulus, king of the country\r\ncalled Chalcidene, and Sohemus, who was called king of Emesa. Nor was\r\nthere any opposition made to his forces when they entered the kingdom;\r\nfor no one of that country would so much as lift up his hand against\r\nthem. When Antiochus heard this unexpected news, he could not think in\r\nthe least of making war with the Romans, but determined to leave his\r\nwhole kingdom in the state wherein it now was, and to retire privately,\r\nwith his wife and children, as thinking thereby to demonstrate himself\r\nto the Romans to be innocent as to the accusation laid against him. So\r\nhe went away from that city as far as a hundred and twenty furlongs,\r\ninto a plain, and there pitched his tents.\r\n\r\n2. Petus then sent some of his men to seize upon Samosate, and by their\r\nmeans took possession of that city, while he went himself to attack\r\nAntiochus with the rest of his army. However, the king was not prevailed\r\nupon by the distress he was in to do any thing in the way of war against\r\nthe Romans, but bemoaned his own hard fate, and endured with patience\r\nwhat he was not able to prevent. But his sons, who were young, and\r\nunexperienced in war, but of strong bodies, were not easily induced\r\nto bear this calamity without fighting. Epiphanes, therefore, and\r\nCallinicus, betook themselves to military force; and as the battle was a\r\nsore one, and lasted all the day long, they showed their own valor in\r\na remarkable manner, and nothing but the approach of night put a period\r\nthereto, and that without any diminution of their forces; yet would\r\nnot Antiochus, upon this conclusion of the fight, continue there by any\r\nmeans, but took his wife and his daughters, and fled away with them\r\nto Cilicia, and by so doing quite discouraged the minds of his own\r\nsoldiers. Accordingly, they revolted, and went over to the Romans, out\r\nof the despair they were in of his keeping the kingdom; and his case was\r\nlooked upon by all as quite desperate. It was therefore necessary that\r\nEpiphanes and his soldiers should get clear of their enemies before they\r\nbecame entirely destitute of any confederates; nor were there any more\r\nthan ten horsemen with him, who passed with him over Euphrates, whence\r\nthey went undisturbed to Vologeses, the king of Parthia, where they were\r\nnot disregarded as fugitives, but had the same respect paid them as if\r\nthey had retained their ancient prosperity.\r\n\r\n3. Now when Antiochus was come to Tarsus in Cilicia, Petus ordered\r\na centurion to go to him, and send him in bonds to Rome. However,\r\nVespasian could not endure to have a king brought to him in that manner,\r\nbut thought it fit rather to have a regard to the ancient friendship\r\nthat had been between them, than to preserve an inexorable anger upon\r\npretense of this war. Accordingly, he gave orders that they should take\r\noff his bonds, while he was still upon the road, and that he should not\r\ncome to Rome, but should now go and live at Lacedemon; he also gave him\r\nlarge revenues, that he might not only live in plenty, but like a king\r\nalso. When Epiphanes, who before was in great fear for his father, was\r\ninformed of this, their minds were freed from that great and almost\r\nincurable concern they had been under. He also hoped that Caesar would\r\nbe reconciled to them, upon the intercession of Vologeses; for although\r\nhe lived in plenty, he knew not how to bear living out of the Roman\r\nempire. So Caesar gave him leave, after an obliging manner, and he came\r\nto Rome; and as his father came quickly to him from Lacedemon, he had\r\nall sorts of respect paid him there, and there he remained.\r\n\r\n4. Now there was a nation of the Alans, which we have formerly mentioned\r\nsome where as being Scythians and inhabiting at the lake Meotis. This\r\nnation about this time laid a design of falling upon Media, and the\r\nparts beyond it, in order to plunder them; with which intention they\r\ntreated with the king of Hyrcania; for he was master of that passage\r\nwhich king Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates. This king gave\r\nthem leave to come through them; so they came in great multitudes, and\r\nfell upon the Medes unexpectedly, and plundered their country, which\r\nthey found full of people, and replenished with abundance of cattle,\r\nwhile nobody durst make any resistance against them; for Paeorus, the\r\nking of the country, had fled away for fear into places where they could\r\nnot easily come at him, and had yielded up every thing he had to them,\r\nand had only saved his wife and his concubines from them, and that with\r\ndifficulty also, after they had been made captives, by giving them a\r\nhundred talents for their ransom. These Alans therefore plundered the\r\ncountry without opposition, and with great ease, and proceeded as far\r\nas Armenia, laying all waste before them. Now Tiridates was king of that\r\ncountry, who met them, and fought them, but had like to have been taken\r\nalive in the battle; for a certain man threw a net over him from a great\r\ndistance, and had soon drawn him to him, unless he had immediately cut\r\nthe cord with his sword, and ran away, and prevented it. So the Alans,\r\nbeing still more provoked by this sight, laid waste the country, and\r\ndrove a great multitude of the men, and a great quantity of the other\r\nprey they had gotten out of both kingdoms, along with them, and then\r\nretreated back to their own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning Masada And Those Sicarii Who Kept It; And How\r\n     Silva Betook Himself To Form The Siege Of That Citadel.\r\n     Eleazar's Speeches To The Besieged.\r\n\r\n1. When Bassus was dead in Judea, Flavius Silva succeeded him as\r\nprocurator there; who, when he saw that all the rest of the country was\r\nsubdued in this war, and that there was but one only strong hold\r\nthat was still in rebellion, he got all his army together that lay in\r\ndifferent places, and made an expedition against it. This fortress was\r\ncalled Masada. It was one Eleazar, a potent man, and the commander of\r\nthese Sicarii, that had seized upon it. He was a descendant from that\r\nJudas who had persuaded abundance of the Jews, as we have formerly\r\nrelated, not to submit to the taxation when Cyrenius was sent into Judea\r\nto make one; for then it was that the Sicarii got together against\r\nthose that were willing to submit to the Romans, and treated them in all\r\nrespects as if they had been their enemies, both by plundering them\r\nof what they had, by driving away their cattle, and by setting fire\r\nto their houses; for they said that they differed not at all from\r\nforeigners, by betraying, in so cowardly a manner, that freedom which\r\nJews thought worthy to be contended for to the utmost, and by owning\r\nthat they preferred slavery under the Romans before such a contention.\r\nNow this was in reality no better than a pretense and a cloak for the\r\nbarbarity which was made use of by them, and to color over their own\r\navarice, which they afterwards made evident by their own actions; for\r\nthose that were partners with them in their rebellion joined also with\r\nthem in the war against the Romans, and went further lengths with them\r\nin their impudent undertakings against them; and when they were again\r\nconvicted of dissembling in such their pretenses, they still more abused\r\nthose that justly reproached them for their wickedness. And indeed that\r\nwas a time most fertile in all manner of wicked practices, insomuch that\r\nno kind of evil deeds were then left undone; nor could any one so much\r\nas devise any bad thing that was new, so deeply were they all infected,\r\nand strove with one another in their single capacity, and in their\r\ncommunities, who should run the greatest lengths in impiety towards\r\nGod, and in unjust actions towards their neighbors; the men of power\r\noppressing the multitude, and the multitude earnestly laboring to\r\ndestroy the men of power. The one part were desirous of tyrannizing over\r\nothers, and the rest of offering violence to others, and of plundering\r\nsuch as were richer than themselves. They were the Sicarii who first\r\nbegan these transgressions, and first became barbarous towards those\r\nallied to them, and left no words of reproach unsaid, and no works of\r\nperdition untried, in order to destroy those whom their contrivances\r\naffected. Yet did John demonstrate by his actions that these Sicarii\r\nwere more moderate than he was himself, for he not only slew all such\r\nas gave him good counsel to do what was right, but treated them worst of\r\nall, as the most bitter enemies that he had among all the Citizens; nay,\r\nhe filled his entire country with ten thousand instances of wickedness,\r\nsuch as a man who was already hardened sufficiently in his impiety\r\ntowards God would naturally do; for the food was unlawful that was set\r\nupon his table, and he rejected those purifications that the law of his\r\ncountry had ordained; so that it was no longer a wonder if he, who\r\nwas so mad in his impiety towards God, did not observe any rules of\r\ngentleness and common affection towards men. Again, therefore, what\r\nmischief was there which Simon the son of Gioras did not do? or what\r\nkind of abuses did he abstain from as to those very free-men who had set\r\nhim up for a tyrant? What friendship or kindred were there that did not\r\nmake him more bold in his daily murders? for they looked upon the doing\r\nof mischief to strangers only as a work beneath their courage, but\r\nthought their barbarity towards their nearest relations would be a\r\nglorious demonstration thereof. The Idumeans also strove with these\r\nmen who should be guilty of the greatest madness! for they [all], vile\r\nwretches as they were, cut the throats of the high priests, that so\r\nno part of a religious regard to God might be preserved; they\r\nthence proceeded to destroy utterly the least remains of a political\r\ngovernment, and introduced the most complete scene of iniquity in all\r\ninstances that were practicable; under which scene that sort of people\r\nthat were called zealots grew up, and who indeed corresponded to\r\nthe name; for they imitated every wicked work; nor, if their memory\r\nsuggested any evil thing that had formerly been done, did they avoid\r\nzealously to pursue the same; and although they gave themselves that\r\nname from their zeal for what was good, yet did it agree to them only\r\nby way of irony, on account of those they had unjustly treated by their\r\nwild and brutish disposition, or as thinking the greatest mischiefs to\r\nbe the greatest good. Accordingly, they all met with such ends as God\r\ndeservedly brought upon them in way of punishment; for all such miseries\r\nhave been sent upon them as man's nature is capable of undergoing,\r\ntill the utmost period of their lives, and till death came upon them\r\nin various ways of torment; yet might one say justly that they suffered\r\nless than they had done, because it was impossible they could be\r\npunished according to their deserving. But to make a lamentation\r\naccording to the deserts of those who fell under these men's barbarity,\r\nthis is not a proper place for it;--I therefore now return again to the\r\nremaining part of the present narration.\r\n\r\n2. For now it was that the Roman general came, and led his army against\r\nEleazar and those Sicarii who held the fortress Masada together with\r\nhim; and for the whole country adjoining, he presently gained it, and\r\nput garrisons into the most proper places of it; he also built a wall\r\nquite round the entire fortress, that none of the besieged might easily\r\nescape; he also set his men to guard the several parts of it; he also\r\npitched his camp in such an agreeable place as he had chosen for the\r\nsiege, and at which place the rock belonging to the fortress did make\r\nthe nearest approach to the neighboring mountain, which yet was a place\r\nof difficulty for getting plenty of provisions; for it was not only food\r\nthat was to be brought from a great distance [to the army], and this\r\nwith a great deal of pain to those Jews who were appointed for that\r\npurpose, but water was also to be brought to the camp, because the place\r\nafforded no fountain that was near it. When therefore Silva had ordered\r\nthese affairs beforehand, he fell to besieging the place; which siege\r\nwas likely to stand in need of a great deal of skill and pains, by\r\nreason of the strength of the fortress, the nature of which I will now\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n3. There was a rock, not small in circumference, and very high. It was\r\nencompassed with valleys of such vast depth downward, that the eye could\r\nnot reach their bottoms; they were abrupt, and such as no animal could\r\nwalk upon, excepting at two places of the rock, where it subsides, in\r\norder to afford a passage for ascent, though not without difficulty.\r\nNow, of the ways that lead to it, one is that from the lake Asphaltites,\r\ntowards the sun-rising, and another on the west, where the ascent is\r\neasier: the one of these ways is called the Serpent, as resembling that\r\nanimal in its narrowness and its perpetual windings; for it is broken\r\noff at the prominent precipices of the rock, and returns frequently into\r\nitself, and lengthening again by little and little, hath much ado to\r\nproceed forward; and he that would walk along it must first go on one\r\nleg, and then on the other; there is also nothing but destruction, in\r\ncase your feet slip; for on each side there is a vastly deep chasm and\r\nprecipice, sufficient to quell the courage of every body by the terror\r\nit infuses into the mind. When, therefore, a man hath gone along this\r\nway for thirty furlongs, the rest is the top of the hill--not ending at\r\na small point, but is no other than a plain upon the highest part of the\r\nmountain. Upon this top of the hill, Jonathan the high priest first of\r\nall built a fortress, and called it Masada: after which the rebuilding\r\nof this place employed the care of king Herod to a great degree; he\r\nalso built a wall round about the entire top of the hill, seven furlongs\r\nlong; it was composed of white stone; its height was twelve, and\r\nits breadth eight cubits; there were also erected upon that wall\r\nthirty-eight towers, each of them fifty cubits high; out of which you\r\nmight pass into lesser edifices, which were built on the inside, round\r\nthe entire wall; for the king reserved the top of the hill, which was of\r\na fat soil, and better mould than any valley for agriculture, that such\r\nas committed themselves to this fortress for their preservation might\r\nnot even there be quite destitute of food, in case they should ever be\r\nin want of it from abroad. Moreover, he built a palace therein at the\r\nwestern ascent; it was within and beneath the walls of the citadel, but\r\ninclined to its north side. Now the wall of this palace was very high\r\nand strong, and had at its four corners towers sixty cubits high. The\r\nfurniture also of the edifices, and of the cloisters, and of the\r\nbaths, was of great variety, and very costly; and these buildings were\r\nsupported by pillars of single stones on every side; the walls and also\r\nthe floors of the edifices were paved with stones of several colors. He\r\nalso had cut many and great pits, as reservoirs for water, out of the\r\nrocks, at every one of the places that were inhabited, both above and\r\nround about the palace, and before the wall; and by this contrivance\r\nhe endeavored to have water for several uses, as if there had been\r\nfountains there. Here was also a road digged from the palace, and\r\nleading to the very top of the mountain, which yet could not be seen by\r\nsuch as were without [the walls]; nor indeed could enemies easily\r\nmake use of the plain roads; for the road on the east side, as we have\r\nalready taken notice, could not be walked upon, by reason of its nature;\r\nand for the western road, he built a large tower at its narrowest place,\r\nat no less a distance from the top of the hill than a thousand cubits;\r\nwhich tower could not possibly be passed by, nor could it be easily\r\ntaken; nor indeed could those that walked along it without any fear\r\n[such was its contrivance] easily get to the end of it; and after such\r\na manner was this citadel fortified, both by nature and by the hands of\r\nmen, in order to frustrate the attacks of enemies.\r\n\r\n4. As for the furniture that was within this fortress, it was still more\r\nwonderful on account of its splendor and long continuance; for here was\r\nlaid up corn in large quantities, and such as would subsist men for a\r\nlong time; here was also wine and oil in abundance, with all kinds of\r\npulse and dates heaped up together; all which Eleazar found there, when\r\nhe and his Sicarii got possession of the fortress by treachery. These\r\nfruits were also fresh and full ripe, and no way inferior to such fruits\r\nnewly laid in, although they were little short of a hundred years 14\r\nfrom the laying in these provisions [by Herod], till the place was taken\r\nby the Romans; nay, indeed, when the Romans got possession of those\r\nfruits that were left, they found them not corrupted all that while; nor\r\nshould we be mistaken, if we supposed that the air was here the cause\r\nof their enduring so long; this fortress being so high, and so free from\r\nthe mixture of all terrain and muddy particles of matter. There was also\r\nfound here a large quantity of all sorts of weapons of war, which had\r\nbeen treasured up by that king, and were sufficient for ten thousand\r\nmen; there was cast iron, and brass, and tin, which show that he\r\nhad taken much pains to have all things here ready for the greatest\r\noccasions; for the report goes how Herod thus prepared this fortress on\r\nhis own account, as a refuge against two kinds of danger; the one for\r\nfear of the multitude of the Jews, lest they should depose him, and\r\nrestore their former kings to the government; the other danger was\r\ngreater and more terrible, which arose from Cleopatra queen of Egypt,\r\nwho did not conceal her intentions, but spoke often to Antony, and\r\ndesired him to cut off Herod, and entreated him to bestow the kingdom of\r\nJudea upon her. And certainly it is a great wonder that Antony did never\r\ncomply with her commands in this point, as he was so miserably enslaved\r\nto his passion for her; nor should any one have been surprised if she\r\nhad been gratified in such her request. So the fear of these dangers\r\nmade Herod rebuild Masada, and thereby leave it for the finishing stroke\r\nof the Romans in this Jewish war.\r\n\r\n5. Since therefore the Roman commander Silva had now built a wall on the\r\noutside, round about this whole place, as we have said already, and\r\nhad thereby made a most accurate provision to prevent any one of the\r\nbesieged running away, he undertook the siege itself, though he found\r\nbut one single place that would admit of the banks he was to raise; for\r\nbehind that tower which secured the road that led to the palace, and to\r\nthe top of the hill from the west; there was a certain eminency of the\r\nrock, very broad and very prominent, but three hundred cubits beneath\r\nthe highest part of Masada; it was called the White Promontory.\r\nAccordingly, he got upon that part of the rock, and ordered the army\r\nto bring earth; and when they fell to that work with alacrity, and\r\nabundance of them together, the bank was raised, and became solid for\r\ntwo hundred cubits in height. Yet was not this bank thought sufficiently\r\nhigh for the use of the engines that were to be set upon it; but still\r\nanother elevated work of great stones compacted together was raised upon\r\nthat bank; this was fifty cubits, both in breadth and height. The other\r\nmachines that were now got ready were like to those that had been first\r\ndevised by Vespasian, and afterwards by Titus, for sieges. There was\r\nalso a tower made of the height of sixty cubits, and all over plated\r\nwith iron, out of which the Romans threw darts and stones from the\r\nengines, and soon made those that fought from the walls of the place to\r\nretire, and would not let them lift up their heads above the works. At\r\nthe same time Silva ordered that great battering ram which he had made\r\nto be brought thither, and to be set against the wall, and to make\r\nfrequent batteries against it, which with some difficulty broke down\r\na part of the wall, and quite overthrew it. However, the Sicarii made\r\nhaste, and presently built another wall within that, which should not be\r\nliable to the same misfortune from the machines with the other; it was\r\nmade soft and yielding, and so was capable of avoiding the terrible\r\nblows that affected the other. It was framed after the following manner:\r\nThey laid together great beams of wood lengthways, one close to the end\r\nof another, and the same way in which they were cut: there were two of\r\nthese rows parallel to one another, and laid at such a distance from\r\neach other as the breadth of the wall required, and earth was put into\r\nthe space between those rows. Now, that the earth might not fall away\r\nupon the elevation of this bank to a greater height, they further laid\r\nother beams over cross them, and thereby bound those beams together that\r\nlay lengthways. This work of theirs was like a real edifice; and when\r\nthe machines were applied, the blows were weakened by its yielding; and\r\nas the materials by such concussion were shaken closer together, the\r\npile by that means became firmer than before. When Silva saw this, he\r\nthought it best to endeavor the taking of this wall by setting fire to\r\nit; so he gave order that the soldiers should throw a great number of\r\nburning torches upon it: accordingly, as it was chiefly made of wood,\r\nit soon took fire; and when it was once set on fire, its hollowness made\r\nthat fire spread to a mighty flame. Now, at the very beginning of this\r\nfire, a north wind that then blew proved terrible to the Romans; for by\r\nbringing the flame downward, it drove it upon them, and they were almost\r\nin despair of success, as fearing their machines would be burnt: but\r\nafter this, on a sudden the wind changed into the south, as if it were\r\ndone by Divine Providence, and blew strongly the contrary way, and\r\ncarried the flame, and drove it against the wall, which was now on fire\r\nthrough its entire thickness. So the Romans, having now assistance\r\nfrom God, returned to their camp with joy, and resolved to attack their\r\nenemies the very next day; on which occasion they set their watch more\r\ncarefully that night, lest any of the Jews should run away from them\r\nwithout being discovered.\r\n\r\n6. However, neither did Eleazar once think of flying away, nor would he\r\npermit any one else to do so; but when he saw their wall burned down by\r\nthe fire, and could devise no other way of escaping, or room for their\r\nfurther courage, and setting before their eyes what the Romans would do\r\nto them, their children, and their wives, if they got them into their\r\npower, he consulted about having them all slain. Now as he judged this\r\nto be the best thing they could do in their present circumstances, he\r\ngathered the most courageous of his companions together, and encouraged\r\nthem to take that course by a speech 15 which he made to them in the\r\nmanner following: \"Since we, long ago, my generous friends, resolved\r\nnever to be servants to the Romans, nor to any other than to God\r\nhimself, who alone is the true and just Lord of mankind, the time is now\r\ncome that obliges us to make that resolution true in practice. And\r\nlet us not at this time bring a reproach upon ourselves for\r\nself-contradiction, while we formerly would not undergo slavery, though\r\nit were then without danger, but must now, together with slavery,\r\nchoose such punishments also as are intolerable; I mean this, upon the\r\nsupposition that the Romans once reduce us under their power while we\r\nare alive. We were the very first that revolted from them, and we are\r\nthe last that fight against them; and I cannot but esteem it as a favor\r\nthat God hath granted us, that it is still in our power to die bravely,\r\nand in a state of freedom, which hath not been the case of others, who\r\nwere conquered unexpectedly. It is very plain that we shall be taken\r\nwithin a day's time; but it is still an eligible thing to die after a\r\nglorious manner, together with our dearest friends. This is what our\r\nenemies themselves cannot by any means hinder, although they be very\r\ndesirous to take us alive. Nor can we propose to ourselves any more\r\nto fight them, and beat them. It had been proper indeed for us to have\r\nconjectured at the purpose of God much sooner, and at the very first,\r\nwhen we were so desirous of defending our liberty, and when we received\r\nsuch sore treatment from one another, and worse treatment from our\r\nenemies, and to have been sensible that the same God, who had of old\r\ntaken the Jewish nation into his favor, had now condemned them to\r\ndestruction; for had he either continued favorable, or been but in a\r\nlesser degree displeased with us, he had not overlooked the destruction\r\nof so many men, or delivered his most holy city to be burnt and\r\ndemolished by our enemies. To be sure we weakly hoped to have preserved\r\nourselves, and ourselves alone, still in a state of freedom, as if we\r\nhad been guilty of no sins ourselves against God, nor been partners with\r\nthose of others; we also taught other men to preserve their liberty.\r\nWherefore, consider how God hath convinced us that our hopes were in\r\nvain, by bringing such distress upon us in the desperate state we are\r\nnow in, and which is beyond all our expectations; for the nature of this\r\nfortress which was in itself unconquerable, hath not proved a means of\r\nour deliverance; and even while we have still great abundance of food,\r\nand a great quantity of arms, and other necessaries more than we want,\r\nwe are openly deprived by God himself of all hope of deliverance; for\r\nthat fire which was driven upon our enemies did not of its own accord\r\nturn back upon the wall which we had built; this was the effect of God's\r\nanger against us for our manifold sins, which we have been guilty of\r\nin a most insolent and extravagant manner with regard to our own\r\ncountrymen; the punishments of which let us not receive from the Romans,\r\nbut from God himself, as executed by our own hands; for these will be\r\nmore moderate than the other. Let our wives die before they are abused,\r\nand our children before they have tasted of slavery; and after we\r\nhave slain them, let us bestow that glorious benefit upon one another\r\nmutually, and preserve ourselves in freedom, as an excellent funeral\r\nmonument for us. But first let us destroy our money and the fortress\r\nby fire; for I am well assured that this will be a great grief to the\r\nRomans, that they shall not be able to seize upon our bodies, and shall\r\nfail of our wealth also; and let us spare nothing but our provisions;\r\nfor they will be a testimonial when we are dead that we were not subdued\r\nfor want of necessaries, but that, according to our original resolution,\r\nwe have preferred death before slavery.\"\r\n\r\n7. This was Eleazar's speech to them. Yet did not the opinions of all\r\nthe auditors acquiesce therein; but although some of them were very\r\nzealous to put his advice in practice, and were in a manner filled with\r\npleasure at it, and thought death to be a good thing, yet had those that\r\nwere most effeminate a commiseration for their wives and families;\r\nand when these men were especially moved by the prospect of their own\r\ncertain death, they looked wistfully at one another, and by the tears\r\nthat were in their eyes declared their dissent from his opinion.\r\nWhen Eleazar saw these people in such fear, and that their souls were\r\ndejected at so prodigious a proposal, he was afraid lest perhaps these\r\neffeminate persons should, by their lamentations and tears, enfeeble\r\nthose that heard what he had said courageously; so he did not leave\r\noff exhorting them, but stirred up himself, and recollecting proper\r\narguments for raising their courage, he undertook to speak more briskly\r\nand fully to them, and that concerning the immortality of the soul. So\r\nhe made a lamentable groan, and fixing his eyes intently on those that\r\nwept, he spake thus: \"Truly, I was greatly mistaken when I thought to be\r\nassisting to brave men who struggled hard for their liberty, and to such\r\nas were resolved either to live with honor, or else to die; but I find\r\nthat you are such people as are no better than others, either in virtue\r\nor in courage, and are afraid of dying, though you be delivered thereby\r\nfrom the greatest miseries, while you ought to make no delay in this\r\nmatter, nor to await any one to give you good advice; for the laws of\r\nour country, and of God himself, have from ancient times, and as soon as\r\never we could use our reason, continually taught us, and our forefathers\r\nhave corroborated the same doctrine by their actions, and by their\r\nbravery of mind, that it is life that is a calamity to men, and not\r\ndeath; for this last affords our souls their liberty, and sends them\r\nby a removal into their own place of purity, where they are to be\r\ninsensible of all sorts of misery; for while souls are tied down to a\r\nmortal body, they are partakers of its miseries; and really, to speak\r\nthe truth, they are themselves dead; for the union of what is divine\r\nto what is mortal is disagreeable. It is true, the power of the soul\r\nis great, even when it is imprisoned in a mortal body; for by moving it\r\nafter a way that is invisible, it makes the body a sensible instrument,\r\nand causes it to advance further in its actions than mortal nature could\r\notherwise do. However, when it is freed from that weight which draws it\r\ndown to the earth and is connected with it, it obtains its own proper\r\nplace, and does then become a partaker of that blessed power, and those\r\nabilities, which are then every way incapable of being hindered in their\r\noperations. It continues invisible, indeed, to the eyes of men, as does\r\nGod himself; for certainly it is not itself seen while it is in the\r\nbody; for it is there after an invisible manner, and when it is freed\r\nfrom it, it is still not seen. It is this soul which hath one nature,\r\nand that an incorruptible one also; but yet it is the cause of the\r\nchange that is made in the body; for whatsoever it be which the soul\r\ntouches, that lives and flourishes; and from whatsoever it is removed,\r\nthat withers away and dies; such a degree is there in it of immortality.\r\nLet me produce the state of sleep as a most evident demonstration of\r\nthe truth of what I say; wherein souls, when the body does not distract\r\nthem, have the sweetest rest depending on themselves, and conversing\r\nwith God, by their alliance to him; they then go every where, and\r\nforetell many futurities beforehand. And why are we afraid of death,\r\nwhile we are pleased with the rest that we have in sleep? And how absurd\r\na thing is it to pursue after liberty while we are alive, and yet to\r\nenvy it to ourselves where it will be eternal! We, therefore, who have\r\nbeen brought up in a discipline of our own, ought to become an example\r\nto others of our readiness to die. Yet, if we do stand in need of\r\nforeigners to support us in this matter, let us regard those Indians\r\nwho profess the exercise of philosophy; for these good men do but\r\nunwillingly undergo the time of life, and look upon it as a necessary\r\nservitude, and make haste to let their souls loose from their bodies;\r\nnay, when no misfortune presses them to it, nor drives them upon it,\r\nthese have such a desire of a life of immortality, that they tell other\r\nmen beforehand that they are about to depart; and nobody hinders them,\r\nbut every one thinks them happy men, and gives them letters to be\r\ncarried to their familiar friends [that are dead], so firmly and\r\ncertainly do they believe that souls converse with one another [in the\r\nother world]. So when these men have heard all such commands that were\r\nto be given them, they deliver their body to the fire; and, in order\r\nto their getting their soul a separation from the body in the greatest\r\npurity, they die in the midst of hymns of commendations made to them;\r\nfor their dearest friends conduct them to their death more readily than\r\ndo any of the rest of mankind conduct their fellow-citizens when they\r\nare going a very long journey, who at the same time weep on their own\r\naccount, but look upon the others as happy persons, as so soon to be\r\nmade partakers of the immortal order of beings. Are not we, therefore,\r\nashamed to have lower notions than the Indians? and by our own cowardice\r\nto lay a base reproach upon the laws of our country, which are so much\r\ndesired and imitated by all mankind? But put the case that we had\r\nbeen brought up under another persuasion, and taught that life is the\r\ngreatest good which men are capable of, and that death is a calamity;\r\nhowever, the circumstances we are now in ought to be an inducement to us\r\nto bear such calamity courageously, since it is by the will of God, and\r\nby necessity, that we are to die; for it now appears that God hath\r\nmade such a decree against the whole Jewish nation, that we are to be\r\ndeprived of this life which [he knew] we would not make a due use\r\nof. For do not you ascribe the occasion of our present condition to\r\nyourselves, nor think the Romans are the true occasion that this war we\r\nhave had with them is become so destructive to us all: these things\r\nhave not come to pass by their power, but a more powerful cause hath\r\nintervened, and made us afford them an occasion of their appearing to be\r\nconquerors over us. What Roman weapons, I pray you, were those by which\r\nthe Jews at Cesarea were slain? On the contrary, when they were no way\r\ndisposed to rebel, but were all the while keeping their seventh day\r\nfestival, and did not so much as lift up their hands against the\r\ncitizens of Cesarea, yet did those citizens run upon them in great\r\ncrowds, and cut their throats, and the throats of their wives and\r\nchildren, and this without any regard to the Romans themselves, who\r\nnever took us for their enemies till we revolted from them. But some may\r\nbe ready to say, that truly the people of Cesarea had always a quarrel\r\nagainst those that lived among them, and that when an opportunity\r\noffered itself, they only satisfied the old rancor they had against\r\nthem. What then shall we say to those of Scythopolis, who ventured to\r\nwage war with us on account of the Greeks? Nor did they do it by way of\r\nrevenge upon the Romans, when they acted in concert with our countrymen.\r\nWherefore you see how little our good-will and fidelity to them profited\r\nus, while they were slain, they and their whole families, after the most\r\ninhuman manner, which was all the requital that was made them for the\r\nassistance they had afforded the others; for that very same destruction\r\nwhich they had prevented from falling upon the others did they suffer\r\nthemselves from them, as if they had been ready to be the actors\r\nagainst them. It would be too long for me to speak at this time of every\r\ndestruction brought upon us; for you cannot but know that there was not\r\nany one Syrian city which did not slay their Jewish inhabitants, and\r\nwere not more bitter enemies to us than were the Romans themselves; nay,\r\neven those of Damascus, 16 when they were able to allege no tolerable\r\npretense against us, filled their city with the most barbarous\r\nslaughters of our people, and cut the throats of eighteen thousand Jews,\r\nwith their wives and children. And as to the multitude of those that\r\nwere slain in Egypt, and that with torments also, we have been informed\r\nthey were more than sixty thousand; those indeed being in a foreign\r\ncountry, and so naturally meeting with nothing to oppose against their\r\nenemies, were killed in the manner forementioned. As for all those of\r\nus who have waged war against the Romans in our own country, had we not\r\nsufficient reason to have sure hopes of victory? For we had arms, and\r\nwalls, and fortresses so prepared as not to be easily taken, and courage\r\nnot to be moved by any dangers in the cause of liberty, which encouraged\r\nus all to revolt from the Romans. But then these advantages sufficed\r\nus but for a short time, and only raised our hopes, while they really\r\nappeared to be the origin of our miseries; for all we had hath been\r\ntaken from us, and all hath fallen under our enemies, as if these\r\nadvantages were only to render their victory over us the more glorious,\r\nand were not disposed for the preservation of those by whom these\r\npreparations were made. And as for those that are already dead in the\r\nwar, it is reasonable we should esteem them blessed, for they are\r\ndead in defending, and not in betraying their liberty; but as to the\r\nmultitude of those that are now under the Romans, who would not pity\r\ntheir condition? and who would not make haste to die, before he would\r\nsuffer the same miseries with them? Some of them have been put upon the\r\nrack, and tortured with fire and whippings, and so died. Some have been\r\nhalf devoured by wild beasts, and yet have been reserved alive to be\r\ndevoured by them a second time, in order to afford laughter and sport to\r\nour enemies; and such of those as are alive still are to be looked on as\r\nthe most miserable, who, being so desirous of death, could not come\r\nat it. And where is now that great city, the metropolis of the Jewish\r\nnation, which was fortified by so many walls round about, which had\r\nso many fortresses and large towers to defend it, which could hardly\r\ncontain the instruments prepared for the war, and which had so many ten\r\nthousands of men to fight for it? Where is this city that was believed\r\nto have God himself inhabiting therein? It is now demolished to the very\r\nfoundations, and hath nothing but that monument of it preserved, I mean\r\nthe camp of those that hath destroyed it, which still dwells upon its\r\nruins; some unfortunate old men also lie upon the ashes of the temple,\r\nand a few women are there preserved alive by the enemy, for our bitter\r\nshame and reproach. Now who is there that revolves these things in his\r\nmind, and yet is able to bear the sight of the sun, though he might live\r\nout of danger? Who is there so much his country's enemy, or so unmanly,\r\nand so desirous of living, as not to repent that he is still alive? And\r\nI cannot but wish that we had all died before we had seen that holy city\r\ndemolished by the hands of our enemies, or the foundations of our holy\r\ntemple dug up after so profane a manner. But since we had a generous\r\nhope that deluded us, as if we might perhaps have been able to avenge\r\nourselves on our enemies on that account, though it be now become\r\nvanity, and hath left us alone in this distress, let us make haste to\r\ndie bravely. Let us pity ourselves, our children, and our wives while it\r\nis in our own power to show pity to them; for we were born to die, 17 as\r\nwell as those were whom we have begotten; nor is it in the power of the\r\nmost happy of our race to avoid it. But for abuses, and slavery, and\r\nthe sight of our wives led away after an ignominious manner, with their\r\nchildren, these are not such evils as are natural and necessary among\r\nmen; although such as do not prefer death before those miseries, when it\r\nis in their power so to do, must undergo even them, on account of their\r\nown cowardice. We revolted from the Romans with great pretensions\r\nto courage; and when, at the very last, they invited us to preserve\r\nourselves, we would not comply with them. Who will not, therefore,\r\nbelieve that they will certainly be in a rage at us, in case they can\r\ntake us alive? Miserable will then be the young men who will be strong\r\nenough in their bodies to sustain many torments! miserable also will\r\nbe those of elder years, who will not be able to bear those calamities\r\nwhich young men might sustain! One man will be obliged to hear the voice\r\nof his son implore help of his father, when his hands are bound. But\r\ncertainly our hands are still at liberty, and have a sword in them; let\r\nthem then be subservient to us in our glorious design; let us die before\r\nwe become slaves under our enemies, and let us go out of the world,\r\ntogether with our children and our wives, in a state of freedom. This\r\nit is that our laws command us to do; this it is that our wives\r\nand children crave at our hands; nay, God himself hath brought this\r\nnecessity upon us; while the Romans desire the contrary, and are afraid\r\nlest any of us should die before we are taken. Let us therefore make\r\nhaste, and instead of affording them so much pleasure, as they hope\r\nfor in getting us under their power, let us leave them an example\r\nwhich shall at once cause their astonishment at our death, and their\r\nadmiration of our hardiness therein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n     How The People That Were In The Fortress Were Prevailed On\r\n     By The Words Of Eleazar, Two Women And Five Children Only\r\n     Excepted And All Submitted To Be Killed By One Another.\r\n\r\n1. Now as Eleazar was proceeding on in this exhortation, they all\r\ncut him off short, and made haste to do the work, as full of an\r\nunconquerable ardor of mind, and moved with a demoniacal fury. So they\r\nwent their ways, as one still endeavoring to be before another, and as\r\nthinking that this eagerness would be a demonstration of their courage\r\nand good conduct, if they could avoid appearing in the last class; so\r\ngreat was the zeal they were in to slay their wives and children, and\r\nthemselves also! Nor indeed, when they came to the work itself, did\r\ntheir courage fail them, as one might imagine it would have done, but\r\nthey then held fast the same resolution, without wavering, which they\r\nhad upon the hearing of Eleazar's speech, while yet every one of them\r\nstill retained the natural passion of love to themselves and their\r\nfamilies, because the reasoning they went upon appeared to them to be\r\nvery just, even with regard to those that were dearest to them; for the\r\nhusbands tenderly embraced their wives, and took their children into\r\ntheir arms, and gave the longest parting kisses to them, with tears\r\nin their eyes. Yet at the same time did they complete what they had\r\nresolved on, as if they had been executed by the hands of strangers; and\r\nthey had nothing else for their comfort but the necessity they were in\r\nof doing this execution, to avoid that prospect they had of the miseries\r\nthey were to suffer from their enemies. Nor was there at length any\r\none of these men found that scrupled to act their part in this terrible\r\nexecution, but every one of them despatched his dearest relations.\r\nMiserable men indeed were they! whose distress forced them to slay their\r\nown wives and children with their own hands, as the lightest of those\r\nevils that were before them. So they being not able to bear the grief\r\nthey were under for what they had done any longer, and esteeming it an\r\ninjury to those they had slain, to live even the shortest space of time\r\nafter them, they presently laid all they had upon a heap, and set fire\r\nto it. They then chose ten men by lot out of them to slay all the rest;\r\nevery one of whom laid himself down by his wife and children on the\r\nground, and threw his arms about them, and they offered their necks to\r\nthe stroke of those who by lot executed that melancholy office; and when\r\nthese ten had, without fear, slain them all, they made the same rule for\r\ncasting lots for themselves, that he whose lot it was should first kill\r\nthe other nine, and after all should kill himself. Accordingly, all\r\nthese had courage sufficient to be no way behind one another in doing\r\nor suffering; so, for a conclusion, the nine offered their necks to the\r\nexecutioner, and he who was the last of all took a view of all the\r\nother bodies, lest perchance some or other among so many that were slain\r\nshould want his assistance to be quite despatched, and when he perceived\r\nthat they were all slain, he set fire to the palace, and with the great\r\nforce of his hand ran his sword entirely through himself, and fell\r\ndown dead near to his own relations. So these people died with this\r\nintention, that they would not leave so much as one soul among them all\r\nalive to be subject to the Romans. Yet was there an ancient woman,\r\nand another who was of kin to Eleazar, and superior to most women in\r\nprudence and learning, with five children, who had concealed themselves\r\nin caverns under ground, and had carried water thither for their drink,\r\nand were hidden there when the rest were intent upon the slaughter of\r\none another. Those others were nine hundred and sixty in number, the\r\nwomen and children being withal included in that computation. This\r\ncalamitous slaughter was made on the fifteenth day of the month\r\nXanthicus [Nisan].\r\n\r\n2. Now for the Romans, they expected that they should be fought in the\r\nmorning, when, accordingly, they put on their armor, and laid bridges of\r\nplanks upon their ladders from their banks, to make an assault upon the\r\nfortress, which they did; but saw nobody as an enemy, but a terrible\r\nsolitude on every side, with a fire within the place, as well as a\r\nperfect silence. So they were at a loss to guess at what had happened.\r\nAt length they made a shout, as if it had been at a blow given by the\r\nbattering ram, to try whether they could bring any one out that was\r\nwithin; the women heard this noise, and came out of their under-ground\r\ncavern, and informed the Romans what had been done, as it was done; and\r\nthe second of them clearly described all both what was said and what\r\nwas done, and this manner of it; yet did they not easily give their\r\nattention to such a desperate undertaking, and did not believe it could\r\nbe as they said; they also attempted to put the fire out, and quickly\r\ncutting themselves a way through it, they came within the palace, and so\r\nmet with the multitude of the slain, but could take no pleasure in the\r\nfact, though it were done to their enemies. Nor could they do other than\r\nwonder at the courage of their resolution, and the immovable contempt of\r\ndeath which so great a number of them had shown, when they went through\r\nwith such an action as that was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     That Many Of The Sicarii Fled To Alexandria Also And What\r\n     Dangers They Were In There; On Which Account That Temple\r\n     Which Had Formerly Been Built By Onias The High Priest Was\r\n     Destroyed.\r\n\r\n1. When Masada was thus taken, the general left a garrison in the\r\nfortress to keep it, and he himself went away to Cesarea; for there were\r\nnow no enemies left in the country, but it was all overthrown by so long\r\na war. Yet did this war afford disturbances and dangerous disorders even\r\nin places very far remote from Judea; for still it came to pass that\r\nmany Jews were slain at Alexandria in Egypt; for as many of the Sicarii\r\nas were able to fly thither, out of the seditious wars in Judea, were\r\nnot content to have saved themselves, but must needs be undertaking to\r\nmake new disturbances, and persuaded many of those that entertained\r\nthem to assert their liberty, to esteem the Romans to be no better than\r\nthemselves, and to look upon God as their only Lord and Master. But when\r\npart of the Jews of reputation opposed them, they slew some of them, and\r\nwith the others they were very pressing in their exhortations to revolt\r\nfrom the Romans; but when the principal men of the senate saw what\r\nmadness they were come to, they thought it no longer safe for themselves\r\nto overlook them. So they got all the Jews together to an assembly, and\r\naccused the madness of the Sicarii, and demonstrated that they had been\r\nthe authors of all the evils that had come upon them. They said also\r\nthat \"these men, now they were run away from Judea, having no sure hope\r\nof escaping, because as soon as ever they shall be known, they will be\r\nsoon destroyed by the Romans, they come hither and fill us full of those\r\ncalamities which belong to them, while we have not been partakers with\r\nthem in any of their sins.\" Accordingly, they exhorted the multitude to\r\nhave a care, lest they should be brought to destruction by their means,\r\nand to make their apology to the Romans for what had been done,\r\nby delivering these men up to them; who being thus apprized of the\r\ngreatness of the danger they were in, complied with what was proposed,\r\nand ran with great violence upon the Sicarii, and seized upon them; and\r\nindeed six hundred of them were caught immediately: but as to all those\r\nthat fled into Egypt 18 and to the Egyptian Thebes, it was not long ere\r\nthey were caught also, and brought back, whose courage, or whether we\r\nought to call it madness, or hardiness in their opinions, every body was\r\namazed at. For when all sorts of torments and vexations of their bodies\r\nthat could be devised were made use of to them, they could not get any\r\none of them to comply so far as to confess, or seem to confess, that\r\nCaesar was their lord; but they preserved their own opinion, in spite\r\nof all the distress they were brought to, as if they received these\r\ntorments and the fire itself with bodies insensible of pain, and with\r\na soul that in a manner rejoiced under them. But what was most of all\r\nastonishing to the beholders was the courage of the children; for not\r\none of these children was so far overcome by these torments, as to name\r\nCaesar for their lord. So far does the strength of the courage [of the\r\nsoul] prevail over the weakness of the body.\r\n\r\n2. Now Lupus did then govern Alexandria, who presently sent Caesar word\r\nof this commotion; who having in suspicion the restless temper of the\r\nJews for innovation, and being afraid lest they should get together\r\nagain, and persuade some others to join with them, gave orders to Lupus\r\nto demolish that Jewish temple which was in the region called Onion,\r\n19 and was in Egypt, which was built and had its denomination from the\r\noccasion following: Onias, the son of Simon, one of the Jewish high\r\npriests fled from Antiochus the king of Syria, when he made war with the\r\nJews, and came to Alexandria; and as Ptolemy received him very kindly,\r\non account of hatred to Antiochus, he assured him, that if he would\r\ncomply with his proposal, he would bring all the Jews to his assistance;\r\nand when the king agreed to do it so far as he was able, he desired him\r\nto give him leave to build a temple some where in Egypt, and to worship\r\nGod according to the customs of his own country; for that the Jews would\r\nthen be so much readier to fight against Antiochus who had laid waste\r\nthe temple at Jerusalem, and that they would then come to him with\r\ngreater good-will; and that, by granting them liberty of conscience,\r\nvery many of them would come over to him.\r\n\r\n3. So Ptolemy complied with his proposals, and gave him a place one\r\nhundred and eighty furlongs distant from Memphis. 20 That Nomos was\r\ncalled the Nomos of Hellopolis, where Onias built a fortress and a\r\ntemple, not like to that at Jerusalem, but such as resembled a tower.\r\nHe built it of large stones to the height of sixty cubits; he made the\r\nstructure of the altar in imitation of that in our own country, and in\r\nlike manner adorned with gifts, excepting the make of the candlestick,\r\nfor he did not make a candlestick, but had a [single] lamp hammered out\r\nof a piece of gold, which illuminated the place with its rays, and which\r\nhe hung by a chain of gold; but the entire temple was encompassed with\r\na wall of burnt brick, though it had gates of stone. The king also gave\r\nhim a large country for a revenue in money, that both the priests might\r\nhave a plentiful provision made for them, and that God might have great\r\nabundance of what things were necessary for his worship. Yet did not\r\nOnias do this out of a sober disposition, but he had a mind to contend\r\nwith the Jews at Jerusalem, and could not forget the indignation he had\r\nfor being banished thence. Accordingly, he thought that by building this\r\ntemple he should draw away a great number from them to himself. There\r\nhad been also a certain ancient prediction made by [a prophet] whose\r\nname was Isaiah, about six hundred years before, that this temple should\r\nbe built by a man that was a Jew in Egypt. And this is the history of\r\nthe building of that temple.\r\n\r\n4. And now Lupus, the governor of Alexandria, upon the receipt of\r\nCaesar's letter, came to the temple, and carried out of it some of the\r\ndonations dedicated thereto, and shut up the temple itself. And as Lupus\r\ndied a little afterward, Paulinus succeeded him. This man left none of\r\nthose donations there, and threatened the priests severely if they\r\ndid not bring them all out; nor did he permit any who were desirous of\r\nworshipping God there so much as to come near the whole sacred place;\r\nbut when he had shut up the gates, he made it entirely inaccessible,\r\ninsomuch that there remained no longer the least footsteps of any Divine\r\nworship that had been in that place. Now the duration of the time from\r\nthe building of this temple till it was shut up again was three hundred\r\nand forty-three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Concerning Jonathan, One Of The Sicarii, That Stirred Up A\r\n     Sedition In Cyrene, And Was A False Accuser [Of The\r\n     Innocent].\r\n\r\n1. And now did the madness of the Sicarii, like a disease, reach as far\r\nas the cities of Cyrene; for one Jonathan, a vile person, and by trade\r\na weaver, came thither and prevailed with no small number of the\r\npoorer sort to give ear to him; he also led them into the desert, upon\r\npromising them that he would show them signs and apparitions. And as for\r\nthe other Jews of Cyrene, he concealed his knavery from them, and put\r\ntricks upon them; but those of the greatest dignity among them informed\r\nCatullus, the governor of the Libyan Pentapolis, of his march into the\r\ndesert, and of the preparations he had made for it. So he sent out after\r\nhim both horsemen and footmen, and easily overcame them, because they\r\nwere unarmed men; of these many were slain in the fight, but some were\r\ntaken alive, and brought to Catullus. As for Jonathan, the head of this\r\nplot, he fled away at that time; but upon a great and very diligent\r\nsearch, which was made all the country over for him, he was at last\r\ntaken. And when he was brought to Catullus, he devised a way whereby he\r\nboth escaped punishment himself, and afforded an occasion to Catullus\r\nof doing much mischief; for he falsely accused the richest men among the\r\nJews, and said that they had put him upon what he did.\r\n\r\n2. Now Catullus easily admitted of these his calumnies, and aggravated\r\nmatters greatly, and made tragical exclamations, that he might also be\r\nsupposed to have had a hand in the finishing of the Jewish war. But what\r\nwas still harder, he did not only give a too easy belief to his stories,\r\nbut he taught the Sicarii to accuse men falsely. He bid this Jonathan,\r\ntherefore, to name one Alexander, a Jew [with whom he had formerly had\r\na quarrel, and openly professed that he hated him]; he also got him to\r\nname his wife Bernice, as concerned with him. These two Catullus ordered\r\nto be slain in the first place; nay, after them he caused all the rich\r\nand wealthy Jews to be slain, being no fewer in all than three thousand.\r\nThis he thought he might do safely, because he confiscated their\r\neffects, and added them to Caesar's revenues.\r\n\r\n3. Nay, indeed, lest any Jews that lived elsewhere should convict him of\r\nhis villainy, he extended his false accusations further, and persuaded\r\nJonathan, and certain others that were caught with him, to bring an\r\naccusation of attempts for innovation against the Jews that were of the\r\nbest character both at Alexandria and at Rome. One of these, against\r\nwhom this treacherous accusation was laid, was Josephus, the writer of\r\nthese books. However, this plot, thus contrived by Catullus, did not\r\nsucceed according to his hopes; for though he came himself to Rome, and\r\nbrought Jonathan and his companions along with him in bonds, and thought\r\nhe should have had no further inquisition made as to those lies that\r\nwere forged under his government, or by his means; yet did Vespasian\r\nsuspect the matter and made an inquiry how far it was true. And when he\r\nunderstood that the accusation laid against the Jews was an unjust one,\r\nhe cleared them of the crimes charged upon them, and this on account of\r\nTitus's concern about the matter, and brought a deserved punishment upon\r\nJonathan; for he was first tormented, and then burnt alive.\r\n\r\n4. But as to Catullus, the emperors were so gentle to him, that he\r\nunderwent no severe condemnation at this time; yet was it not long\r\nbefore he fell into a complicated and almost incurable distemper, and\r\ndied miserably. He was not only afflicted in body, but the distemper\r\nin his mind was more heavy upon him than the other; for he was terribly\r\ndisturbed, and continually cried out that he saw the ghosts of those\r\nwhom he had slain standing before him. Where upon he was not able to\r\ncontain himself, but leaped out of his bed, as if both torments and fire\r\nwere brought to him. This his distemper grew still a great deal worse\r\nand worse continually, and his very entrails were so corroded, that they\r\nfell out of his body, and in that condition he died. Thus he became as\r\ngreat an instance of Divine Providence as ever was, and demonstrated\r\nthat God punishes wicked men.\r\n\r\n5. And here we shall put an end to this our history; wherein we formerly\r\npromised to deliver the same with all accuracy, to such as should be\r\ndesirous of understanding after what manner this war of the Romans with\r\nthe Jews was managed. Of which history, how good the style is, must be\r\nleft to the determination of the readers; but as for its agreement with\r\nthe facts, I shall not scruple to say, and that boldly, that truth hath\r\nbeen what I have alone aimed at through its entire composition.\r\n\r\nWAR BOOK 7 FOOTNOTES 2 (return) [ This Tereutius Rufus, as Reland in\r\npart observes here, is the same person whom the Talmudists call Turnus\r\nRufus; of whom they relate, that \"he ploughed up Sion as a field, and\r\nmade Jerusalem become as heaps, and the mountain of the house as the\r\nhigh Idaces of a forest;\" which was long before foretold by the prophet\r\nMicah, ch. 3:12, and quoted from him in the prophecies of Jeremiah, ch.\r\n26:18.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ See Ecclesiastes 8:11.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ This Berytus was certainly a Roman colony, and has coins\r\nextant that witness the same, as Hudson and Spanheim inform us.

But as Bassus thought he must perform the covenant\r\nhe had made with those that had surrendered the citadel, he let them go,\r\nand restored Eleazar to them, in the beginning of the third century, and\r\nwhich he then procured to be rebuilt, and after which rebuilding it\r\nwas called Nicopolis, is entirely different from that Emmaus which is\r\nmentioned by St. Luke 24;13; see Reland's Paleestina, lib. II. p. 429,\r\nand under the name Ammaus also. But he justly thinks that that in St.\r\nLuke may well be the same with his Ammaus before us, especially since\r\nthe Greek copies here usually make it sixty furlongs distant from\r\nJerusalem, as does St. Luke, though the Latin copies say only thirty.\r\nThe place also allotted for these eight hundred soldiers, as for a Roman\r\ngarrison, in this place, would most naturally be not so remote from\r\nJerusalem as was the other Emmaus, or Nicopolis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ Pliny and others confirm this strange paradox, that\r\nprovisions laid up against sieges will continue good for a hundred\r\nyears, as Spanheim notes upon this place.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ The speeches in this and the next section, as introduced\r\nunder the person of this Eleazar, are exceeding remarkable, and of the\r\nnoblest subjects, the contempt of death, and the dignity and immortality\r\nof the soul; and that not only among the Jews, but among the Indians\r\nthemselves also; and are highly worthy the perusal of all the curious.\r\nIt seems as if that philosophic lady who survived, ch. 9. sect. 1, 2,\r\nremembered the substance of these discourses, as spoken by Eleazar, and\r\nso Josephus clothed them in his own words: at the lowest they contain\r\nthe Jewish notions on these heads, as understood then by our Josephus,\r\nand cannot but deserve a suitable regard from us.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ See B. II. ch. 20. sect. 2, where the number of the slain\r\nis but 10,000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ Reland here sets down a parallel aphorism of one of\r\nthe Jewish Rabbins, \"We are born that we may die, and die that we may\r\nlive.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18 (return) [ Since Josephus here informs us that some of these Sicarii,\r\nor ruffians, went from Alexandria [which was itself in Egypt, in a large\r\nsense] into Egypt, and Thebes there situated, Reland well observes, from\r\nVossius, that Egypt sometimes denotes Proper or Upper Egypt, as distinct\r\nfrom the Delta, and the lower parts near Palestine. Accordingly, as he\r\nadds, those that say it never rains in Egypt must mean the Proper or\r\nUpper Egypt, because it does sometimes rain in the other parts. See the\r\nnote on Antiq. B. II. ch. 7. sect. 7, and B. III. ch. 1. sect. 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19 (return) [ Of this temple of Onias's building in Egypt, see the notes\r\non Antiq. B. XIII. ch. 3. sect. 1. But whereas it is elsewhere, both\r\nof the War, B. I. ch. 1. sect. 1, and in the Antiquities as now quoted,\r\nsaid that this temple was like to that at Jerusalem, and here that it\r\nwas not like it, but like a tower, sect. 3, there is some reason to\r\nsuspect the reading here, and that either the negative particle is here\r\nto be blotted out, or the word entirely added.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20 (return) [ We must observe, that Josephus here speaks of Antiochus\r\nwho profaned the temple as now alive, when Onias had leave given them\r\nby Philometer to build his temple; whereas it seems not to have been\r\nactually built till about fifteen years afterwards. Yet, because it is\r\nsaid in the Antiquities that Onias went to Philometer, B. XII. ch.\r\n9. sect. 7, during the lifetime of that Antiochus, it is probable he\r\npetitioned, and perhaps obtained his leave then, though it were not\r\nactually built or finished till fifteen years afterward.]",
