Poole_\r\n\r\n_HE LOVED YOUNG MARSTER JOHN_\r\n\r\nSome friends driving to Oak Grove, Ala., gave the writer the opportunity\r\non August 4th to interview an old ex-slave, Charlie Aarons, who is quite\r\nvenerable in appearance, and who, when asked his age, replied:\r\n\r\n\"Madam I don't know but I sure been 'round here long time\", and when\r\nasked how old he was at the time of the Surrender he answered:\r\n\r\n\"I was a man able to do a man's work so I 'spects I was eighteen or\r\ntwenty years old.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie, as he is known among his own color and the white people\r\nwho know him, told the writer he was born at Petersburg Va., and his\r\nparents, Aaron and Louisa, were owned by a Mr. J.H. White, who had a\r\nstore in the city, but no plantation. His parents had three children,\r\ntwo boys and one girl, and when Uncle Charlie was about ten years of\r\nage, he was sold by Mr. White to a speculator named Jones who brought\r\nhim to Mobile. He recalled being placed on the block, at the slave mart\r\non Royal and State streets, and the anxiety of hearing the different\r\npeople bidding for him, and being finally sold to a Mr. Jason Harris,\r\nwho lived near Newton Station in Jasper County, Miss.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie never saw or heard of his parents or brother and sister\r\nagain and never knew what became of them.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie said Mr. Harris was a pretty rough master, and somewhat\r\nclose. All rations were weighed out and limited. He had a white overseer\r\nand a negro driver, who was the meanest of all.\r\n\r\nMr. Jason Harris had about sixty slaves, and a large plantation of a\r\nhundred acres, the men and women worked in the fields from six to six,\r\nexcept on Saturday, when they had half day holiday to clean up\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nThe home of the Harris family was a large two story house and the\r\nquarters were the regular log cabins with clay chimneys. They cooked in\r\ntheir cabins, but during the busy season in the fields their dinners\r\nwere sent out to them each slave having his own tin pail marked with his\r\nname. Water would be sent out in a barrel mounted on an ox cart.\r\n\r\nThe old men and women looked after the children of the slaves while\r\ntheir parents worked in the fields.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer asked Uncle Charlie, if his master or mistress ever\r\ntaught him to read or write, he smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"No, Madam, only to work\".\r\n\r\nWhen asked if they had any special festivities at Christmas or any other\r\nholiday, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"No, we had no special jolifications\".\r\n\r\nSaturday nights they would sing and dance in the quarters and have\r\nprayer meetings, then on some Sundays, they would hitch up the mules to\r\na big wagon and all go to the white folks church: and again there would\r\nbe camp meetings held and the slaves from all the surrounding\r\nplantations would attend, going to same in these large wagons, sometimes\r\nhaving four mules to a wagon. They then would have a jolly time along\r\nthe way, singing and calling to one another, and making friends.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie, said, he drove many a load of cotton in the large mule\r\nwagons from Newton Station to Enterprise, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if that wasn't a chance to run away, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Git away, why Madam, those nigger dogs would track you and all you got\r\nwas a beating.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie seemed to look off in the distance and said: \"You know,\r\nMadam, I never saw a slave rebuked until I came to Mississippi,\" and I\r\njust couldn't understand at first, but he grinned and said: \"Lordy,\r\nMadam, some of those niggers were onery, too, and a nigger driver was a\r\ndriver sure enough.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Master's son John Harris went to war, Charlie went with him as\r\nhis body guard, and when asked what his duties were, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I looked after Marster John, tended the horses and the tents. I recalls\r\nwell, Madam, the siege of Vicksburg.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer then asked him if he wasn't afraid of the shot and shell all\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n\"No, Madam,\" he replied, \"I kept way in the back where the camp was, for\r\nI didn't like to feel the earth trembling 'neath my feet, but you see,\r\nMadam, I loved young Marster John, and he loved me, and I just had to\r\nwatch over that boy, and he came through all right.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie said when they were told the Yankees were coming through\r\nfrom their headquarters in Meridian, Mississippi, and warned of their\r\nraids, they all made to the swamps and staid until they had passed on,\r\nbut that the Yankees did not disturb the Jason Harris plantation.\r\n\r\nAfter the Surrender Charlie came to Mobile and worked at the Yankee\r\nCamp, living in the quarters located in Holly's Garden. He drove their\r\nwagons and was paid $14.00 a month and his keep. After his discharge he\r\nworked on steamboats and followed different lines of work, being\r\nemployed for several years at Mr. M.L. Davis' saw mill, and is at\r\npresent living on the Davis place at Oak Grove, Ala., an old Southern\r\nhome, with quarters originally built for the employees of the mill and\r\nstill known as the \"quarters\", and like other ante-bellum homes they\r\nhave their private burying ground on the place.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie was married four times, but now a widower. He had four\r\nchildren, two boys who are dead, and two girls, one Carrie Johnson, a\r\nwidow, living in Kushla, Ala., and the other, Ella Aarons, a grass\r\nwidow, living in Mobile, Ala.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie says he saw Jeff. Davis as an old man, after the war at\r\nMississippi City, Miss., and then his face lit up, and he said; \"Wait a\r\nminute, Madam, I saw another president, let me think,--Yes, Madam I saw\r\nPresident Grant. He came through Mobile from New Orleans, and my! there\r\nwas a big parade that day.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about Abraham Lincoln, Uncle Charlie thought awhile, and\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n\"According to what was issued out in the Bible, there was a time for\r\nslavery, people had to be punished for their sin, and then there was a\r\ntime for it not to be, and the Lord had opened a good view to Mr.\r\nLincoln, and he promoted a good idea.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was asked about Booker T. Washington he replied:\r\n\r\n\"It was traversed out to him until the white folks took part with him\r\nand helped him carry on.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie thinks the present day folks are bad and wicked, and dont\r\nrealize anything like the old folks.\r\n\r\nCharlie is a Baptist, became one when he sought the Lord and thinks all\r\npeople should be religious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony Abercrombie\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Anthony Abercrombie*\r\n    --_Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_OLD JOE CAN KEEP HIS TWO BITS_\r\n\r\nUncle Ant'ny sat dozing in the early morning sunshine on his rickety\r\nfront porch. He is a thin little old man with patches of white wool here\r\nand there on his bald head, and an expression of kindness and gentleness\r\non his wrinkled old face.\r\n\r\nAs I went cautiously up the steps, which appeared none too safe, his\r\ncane which had been leaning against his chair, fell to the floor with a\r\nclatter. He awoke with a start and began fumbling around for it with his\r\ntrembling and bony hands.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Ant'ny, you don't see so well, do you?\" I asked as I recovered\r\nthe stick for him. \"No ma'am, I sho' don't,\" he replied. \"I ain't seed\r\nnone outen one of my eyes in near 'bout sixty years, and de doctor say I\r\ngot a catalac on de yuther one; but I knows you is white folks. I always\r\nis been puny, but I reckon I does purty well considerin' I is a hundred\r\nyears old.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know you are that old?\" I inquired of him. Without\r\nhesitation he answered, \"I knows I's dat old 'cause my mistis put it\r\ndown in de Bible. I was born on de fourth day and I was a full growed\r\nman when de war come on in '61.\r\n\r\n\"Yassum, my mind kinder comes and goes, but I can always 'member 'bout\r\nslave'y time. Hits de things what happen in dese days dat's so easy for\r\nme to disremember. I b'longed to Marster Jim Abercrombie. His plantation\r\nwas 'bout sixteen miles north of Marion in Bibb county. When his son,\r\nyoung Jim, ma'ied, old Marse Jim give me to him and he fetched me to\r\nPerry county.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, old marster didn't go to war 'ca'se he was corrupted; he was deaf\r\nin bofe ears and couldn't see good nuther. But he didn't care much 'bout\r\nme 'caze I was puny like and warn't much 'count in de field.\r\n\r\n\"My mistis, Miss Lou, was raisin' me up to be a carriage driver, an' she\r\nwas jes' as good to me as she could be. She useta dose me up wid castor\r\noil, jimson root, and dogwood tea when I'd be feelin' po'ly, and she'd\r\nalways take up for me when Marse Jim get in behind me 'bout somep'n. I\r\nreckon though I was a purty worrisome nigger in dem days; always gettin'\r\nin some kind of mischief.\r\n\r\n\"O yassum, I useta go to meetin'. Us niggers didn't have no meetin'\r\nhouse on de plantation, but Marse Jim 'lowed us to build a brush arbor.\r\nDen two years atter de surrender I took consideration and j'ined up wid\r\nde Lawd. Dat's how come I live so long. De Lawd done told me, 'Antn'y,\r\nyou got a hundred and twenty miles to trabel. Dat mean you gwine to live\r\na hundred and twenty years, if you stay on de straight an' narrow road.\r\nBut if you don't, you gotter go jes' de same as all de yuthers.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me something about your master's slaves and his overseers,\" I\r\nasked of him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"Marse Jim had 'bout three hundred slaves, and he hed\r\none mighty bad overseer. But he got killed down on de bank of de creek\r\none night. Dey never did find out who killed him, but Marse Jim always\r\nb'lieved de field han's done it. 'Fore dat us niggers useta go down to\r\nde creek to wash ourselves, but atter de overseer got killed down dar,\r\nus jes' leave off dat washin', 'cause some of 'em seed de overseer's\r\nha'nt down dar floatin' over de creek.\r\n\r\n\"Dar was another ha'nt on de plantation, too. Marse Jim had some trouble\r\nwid a big double-j'inted nigger named Joe. One day he turn on Marse Jim\r\nwid a fence rail, and Marse Jim had to pull his gun an' kill him. Well,\r\ndat happen in a skirt of woods what I get my lightwood what I use to\r\nstart a fire. One day I went to dem same woods to get some 'simmons.\r\nAnother nigger went wid me, and he clumb de tree to shake de 'simmons\r\ndown whilst I be pickin' 'em up. 'Fore long I heared another tree\r\nshakin' every time us shake our tree, dat other tree shake too, and down\r\ncame de 'simmons from it. I say to myself, 'Dat's Joe, 'cause he likes\r\n'simmons too.' Den I grab up my basket and holler to de boy in de tree,\r\n'nigger turn loose and drap down from dar, and ketch up wid me if you\r\ncan. I's leavin' here right now, 'cause Old Joe is over dar gettin'\r\n'simmons too.'\r\n\r\n\"Den another time I was in de woods choppin' lightwood. It was 'bout\r\nsundown, and every time my ax go 'whack' on de lightwood knot, I hear\r\nanother whack 'sides mine. I stops and lis'ens and don't hear nothin'.\r\nDen I starts choppin' ag'in I hears de yuther whacks. By dat time my\r\nhoun' dog was crouchin' at my feets, wid de hair standin' up on his back\r\nand I couldn't make him git up nor budge.\r\n\r\n\"Dis time I didn' stop for nothin'. I jes' drap my ax right dar, an' me\r\nand dat houn' dog tore out for home lickety split. When us got dar Marse\r\nJim was settin' on de porch, an' he say: 'Nigger, you been up to somep'n\r\nyou got no business. You is all outen breath. Who you runnin' from?' Den\r\nI say: 'Marse Jim, somebody 'sides me is choppin' in yo' woods, an' I\r\ncan't see him. And Marse Jim, he say: 'Ah, dat ain't nobody but Ole Joe.\r\nDid he owe you anythin'?' An' I say: 'Yassah, he owe me two-bits for\r\nhelpin' him shuck corn.' 'Well,' Marse Jim say, 'don't pay him no mind:\r\nit jes' Old Joe come back to pay you.'\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, I didn' go back to dem woods no mo'. Old Joe can jes' have de\r\ntwo-bits what he owe me, 'cause I don't want him follerin' 'roun' atter\r\nme. When he do I can't keep my mind on my business.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolly Ammond (Ammonds)\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Molly Ammond (Ammonds)*\r\n    --_Gertha Couric_\r\n\r\n_JESUS HAS MY CHILLUN COUNTED_\r\n\r\nI walked along a dusty road under the blazing sun. In the shade of a\r\nwillow tree a Negro man was seated with his legs drawn up and his arms\r\ncrossed upon his knees. His head rested face downward upon his arms, as\r\nhe had the aspect of one in deep slumber. Beside him munching on a few\r\nstraggly weeds, a cantankerous mule took little notice of his\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me where Aunt Molly Ammonds lives?\" I asked in a loud\r\nvoice. The Negro stirred slowly, finally raising his head, and\r\ndisplaying three rabbit teeth, he accompanied his answer with a slight\r\ngesture of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, dar her house raght across de road; de house wid de climbin'\r\nroses on hit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh,\" was the drawled response, and the Negro quickly resumed his\r\nformer posture.\r\n\r\nAunt Molly Ammonds is as gentle as a little child. Her voice is soft and\r\neach phrase measured to the slow functionings of her aged mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Molly Ammond (Ammonds), Eufaula, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Honey,\" she said, \"you ain't gwineter believe dis, but I is de mammy of\r\nthirty chilluns. Jesus got 'em counted an' so is me. I was born in a log\r\ncabin dat had a loft, an' it was on Marse Lee Cato's plantation five\r\nmiles wes' of Eufaula. My pappy's name was Tobe Cato an' my mammy's was\r\nSophia. I had one sister, Marthy, an' two brothers, Bong and Toge. My\r\npappy made all de furniture dat went in our house an' it were might'\r\ngood furniture too. Us useta cook on de fiahplace. Us would cook ash\r\ncakes. Dey was made outen meal, water and a little pinch of lard; on\r\nSundays dey was made outen flour, buttermilk an' lard. Mammy would rake\r\nall de ashes out de fiahplace, den kivver de cake wid de hot ashes an'\r\nlet it cool till it was done.\r\n\r\n\"Yas Missy,\" she continued, \"I recollects dat I was 'bout twelve or\r\nfo'teen when de s'render come, kaze a little atter dat I ma'ied Pastor\r\nAmmonds.

Sometimes de massa whould ride over de place on a\r\nhoss, an' when he come up on de oberseer a-fussin' at a nigger, Massa\r\nsay, 'Don't talk rough to dat nigger when he doin' de bes' he can.'\r\n\r\n\"My pappy had a little garden of his own back of his cabin, an' he\r\nraised some chickens for us to eat, an' we had aigs nearly ev'y mornin'.\r\n\r\n\"De only work I done on de plantation was to nuss some little niggers\r\nwhen dere mammy an' pappy was in de fiel's. Twarn't hard.\r\n\r\n\"Nawsuh! I ain't never seed no slave in chains. Massa Lee was a good\r\nman. He had a church built called de brush house, dat had a flo' and\r\nsome seats, an' a top made outen pine boughs, an' massa's pa, Mr. Cato,\r\nwould preach eve'y Sunday. We sung songs lak 'I Heered De Voice of Jesus\r\nSay,' an' 'I'se Gwine to Die no Mo.' We was all babtized in de creek,\r\nbut none of us was taught to read or write.\r\n\r\n\"No-suh, I ain't never seed no slave run away. Us was treated fine. Our\r\nfolks was quality. We had plenty som'n t'eat, but dem slaves hadda work\r\npowerful hard though. Atter dey come home fum de fiel's dey was so tired\r\ndat dey go raght to sleep, except when de massa had barbecues. Christmas\r\nwas de big time; dere was several days to res' an' make merryin' an'\r\nlots of dem no count niggers got drunk.\r\n\r\n\"When us slaves was sick, Massa Lee would send to Eufaula to fetch Dr.\r\nThornton to give us some medicine. We had de bes' treatment ever.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, white folks, dem days is long ago. All my chilluns done died or\r\nwandered away an' my ole man been dead goin' on twenty years. I been\r\nhere a long time by myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Molly,\" I interrupted. \"There's one thing I've always been wanting\r\nto ask one of you ex-slaves, and that is: what you thought of people\r\nlike Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis and Booker T.

But, thank de Lawd, I\r\nhad good white folks and dey sho' did trus' me, too. I had charge of all\r\nde keys to de house, and I waited on de Missis' and de chillun. I laid\r\nout all de clo'se on Sat'dy night, and den Sunday mawnin's I'd pick up\r\nall de dirty things. Dey did'n' have a thing to do.

Ole Massa he neber\r\nplanted no cotton, and I ain't seen none planted 'tell after I was free.\r\nBut, honey, I could sho 'nuff wash, iron and knit and weave. Sometimes I\r\nweaved six or seven yahds of cloth, and do my house work too. I lernt\r\nthe chillun how to weave, and wash, and iron, and knit too, and I's\r\nwaited on de fo'th generation of our fambly. I jes' wish I could tell\r\ndese young chillun how to do. Iffen dey would only suffer me to talk to\r\ndem, I'd tell dem to be more 'spectful to dere mammies and to dere white\r\nfolks and say 'yes mam' and 'no mam', instid of 'yes' and 'no' lek dey\r\ndo now.\r\n\r\n\"All dis generation thinks of is 'musement.

In the sky, large, white cumulous clouds like\r\ngreat bolls of cotton, floated leisurely northward. Far down the road a\r\nramshackle buckboard disappeared over a slight hill; directly in front\r\nthe path ran at twenty yards into the dilapidated steps of a Negro\r\ncabin, while an old colored man in a vegetable garden to the left to the\r\ncabin broke the stillness with the intermittent metallic sounds of his\r\nspade digging into thirsty soil. I knew at a glance that this was Nathan\r\nBeauchamp.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Uncle Nathan,\" I called.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nathan Beauchamp, Eufaula, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Mornin', white folks,\" he answered, as he discontinued his spading and\r\nraised his hand in a friendly gesture.\r\n\r\nI walked over to where Uncle Nathan was standing and stopped in the\r\nlittle furrows of brown earth. Already a thick coat of dust had formed\r\non my shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Nathan,\" I said, \"I'd like to have a brief chat with you about\r\nslavery days, if you can spare a few minutes from your garden here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, boss,\" he said, punctuating his reply with a spat of tobacco\r\nthat was soon nothing but a dark mark in the parched ground, \"glad to be\r\nof any 'sistance.\"\r\n\r\nWe moved to the shade of a large oak where we sat down together on a\r\nsturdy, home-made bench.\r\n\r\n\"Well, white folks,\" he went on after taking a long turn at the dipper\r\nhanging on the tree which shades a well. \"I'll tell you a story of my\r\nmammy an' pappy. Nathan Beauchamp, my pappy, belonged to Massa Green\r\nBeauchamp at White Oak Springs, near Eufaula.\r\n\r\nMassa Green was a member of de legislature when de capital was at\r\nTuscaloosy. He had many a acre of land an' hund'eds of slaves. Pappy use\r\nto dribe de wagon in to Eufaula to git supplies an' on de way he would\r\nmeet up wid an Injun gal a-carryin' big baskets dat she was a goin' to\r\nsell dere. He would ask her iffen she wanted to ride, an' she always say\r\nyes. So one day pappy came to de massa and tell him dat dere was an\r\nInjun gal on de St. Francis Indian Village dat he wanted fo' a wife, an'\r\nde boss say all right so pappy married de Indian gal. Her name was Mimi.\r\nSo I is half nigger an half Injun. My mammy died 'bout five year after\r\nfreedom, but I can remembers dat she had long black hair, and I\r\nremembers de way de sun sparkle on her teeth when she smile. Atter she\r\nmarried pappy, she still carried her pretty baskets to Eufaula to sell.\r\nSometime she walk all de way dere and back, twenty fo' miles.

He was born in slavery, but most of his knowledge of the evils,\r\nas well as the joys of ante-bellum days, is by hearsay only.\r\n\r\n\"I was borned on de De Graffenreid Place,\" he said, \"nine miles west of\r\nLivingston-Boyd Road. My mother was Luella De Graffenreid an' my pappy\r\nwas Edmund De Graffenreid. Den dey changed my name to Bell. I had one\r\nbrother, Nat, an' two sisters, Jestina an' Clara. I has 'bout sixteen\r\nchilluns, all born on de same place an' most of dem is livin' dere yit.\r\nMy chillun by my firs' wife are Ed, Jack, Holly, Buck, Clarence, Sally,\r\nLiza, Mag an' Luella. Dey ma was Mandy Powell, frum York. Den my second\r\nwife, Bettie Brown, gived me de res' of my chilluns. Le's see, dey is\r\nJimmy, J.W. Alfonso Wallace, Henry, Edna an' ----\" He hesitated,\r\nexplained, \"Dat's as many as I kin' 'member jest now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Oliver Bell, Livingston, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"My gran'ma's name was Cely De Graffenreid an' my gran'pa's name was\r\nPeter. He was a shoemaker fur de place an' made plows, too. He was a\r\nworker an' he learnt me how to pull fodder an' chop corn an' cotton when\r\nI was jest a little scamp jes' a little black nigger.\r\n\r\n\"Us all b'longed to Mr. Tresvan De Graffenreid an' Mistus Rebecca; an'\r\ndey was all good to us. Ol' Mistus read de Bible to us an' got us\r\nbaptized in de river at Horn's bridge, but dat was atter de surrender.\r\nIn slavery times dey didn't like for us to sing an play loud in de\r\nquarters. Honey, I 'members when us had de big prayer meetin's. Dey\r\nwould shut de door so de voice won't git out, an' dey would turn de\r\nwashpot down de door. Dat was to keep de voice inside, dey tol' me.\"\r\n\r\nOliver mused a moment, recalling the old times.\r\n\r\n\"Us chilluns useta have a good time singin' an' a-playin',\" he said. \"I\r\n'members one of our little verses run somethin' lak dis:\r\n\r\n    Shoo, shoo, shoo gander\r\n    Th'ow yo' feathers 'way yander.\r\n\r\n\"Us had ol' corn hollers, too, but I fergits um now. I does remember\r\nthough you could hear dem niggers holler a whole mile.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, it warn't so bad wid us. De white folks was good to us niggers.\r\nUs had 'nough to eat, lak greens, frum de big house. Us had our rations\r\nweighted out; peck o' meal, three pounds of meat, half gallon of\r\n'lasses, made at home in wodden mills; an' dat was for a week. An'\r\nsometimes, on a Sunday us had a little sugar, coffee an' flour. No'm, us\r\ndidn't know what rice was.\r\n\r\n\"What I seed of slavery was a bad idea, I reckon, but ev'ybody thought\r\ndey marster was de bes' in de lan'. Us didn't know no better. A man was\r\ngrowed plum' green 'fo he knew de whole worl' didn't belong to his ol'\r\nmarster.\r\n\r\n\"Us didn't have no bought medicine in dem days; jes' whut us got outta\r\nde woods lak slippery ellum fer fever an' poke salad root; dey he'p a\r\nlot. An' May-apple root would he'p you same as castor oil.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't nobody he'p us learn nothin' much, but mos' of my chilluns went\r\nto Booker T's school. Dey say he's a mighty smart man, an' my chilluns\r\nthinks so, too. It's all right; I wish I could read an' write; den I'd\r\ntell you things you'd lak to know.\"\r\n\r\nHis face clouded for the briefest moment.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you de fust thing I 'members, an' I don't know whut started it.\r\nOne day my mammy done sumpin' an' ol' marster made her pull her dress\r\ndown 'roun' her waist an' made her lay down 'crost de door. Den he taken\r\na leather strop an' whooped her. I 'members dat I started cryin' an'\r\nMistus Beckie said, 'Go git dat boy a biskit.'\r\n\r\n\"I reckerlecks my mammy was a plow han' an' she'd go to work soon an'\r\nput me under de shade of a big ol' post-oak tree. Dere I sat all day,\r\nan' dat tree was my nurse. It still standin' dere yit, an' I won't let\r\nnobody cut it down.\r\n\r\n\"Mammy say I never did learn to walk; jes' one day she sot me down under\r\nde oak, an' fust thing she knowed she look up an' dere I was walkin'\r\ndown de middle of a cotton row.\r\n\r\n\"'Nother thing I 'members when I was a little boy; dat dey was 'vidin'\r\nde corn atter de s'render. Dr. DeGraffenreid measured de corn out to all\r\nof 'em whut was share han's. He'd take a bushel an' give 'em a bushel.\r\nWhen he mos' through he'd throw a ear of corn to dis one, an' give\r\nhimse'f a ear; den he break a ear in two, an' he take part an' give dem\r\npart. Dat was close measurin', I tell you.\r\n\r\n\"Us lived in de third house frum de big house in de quarter, an' when I\r\nwas a boy it was my job to set out shade trees. An' one day de Ku Klux\r\ncome ridin' by an' dey leader was Mister Steve Renfroe. (Alabama bandit\r\nof Reconstruction days). He wore long hair an' he call my pappy out an'\r\nax him a heap of questions. While he sittin' dere his horse pull up nigh\r\n'bout all de trees I done sot out.\r\n\r\n\"Atter talkin' to my pappy, he rode on 'cross Horn's bridge, 'bout two\r\nmiles souf of here, an' dere he met Ol' Man Enoch Sledge an' Frank\r\nSledge. Dey was darkies whut b'longed to Marsa Simmy Sledge's father,\r\nOl' Doctor Sledge. Slaves on dat plantation was 'lowed pretty good\r\nprivilege atter de s'rrender an' was workin' on halvens. Uncle Enoch an'\r\nFrank was in town tradin' some, an' Mr. Renfroe didn't want 'em to have\r\nanything. When dey lef' town, dey pass de Ku Kluxes raght on de slough\r\nbridge. Mister Renfroe ax Enoch to give him a piece of string to fix his\r\nsaddle wid; den shot him. Frank run to de river, but de Ku Kluxes\r\ncotched him an' shot him, too.\r\n\r\n\"De niggers went down to de river dat night an' got de bodies an' buried\r\n'em in de ol' Travis graveyard. My mammy an' daddy is buried dere, too.\r\n\r\n\"Didn' nobody do nothin' 'bout Mister Renfroe 'till he went on an' got\r\nto messin' wid Marsa Simmy Sledge's things; stole a pair of mules an' de\r\nwhite folks rambled atter him 'till dey foun' him in Linden. Dey got so\r\nhot atter him dat he went to his camp in de flat woods down on Bear\r\nCreek. Dem was skeery times, 'case dat man never had no mercy for\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\n\"Dey's a cave down by de burial grounds whut de slaves dug when dey run\r\naway, an' Mister Renfroe stayed dere. It's on de river bank an' its dug\r\nup. You digs an' starts low an' pushes de dirt out an' digs up an' makes\r\na big room up so de water won't git you. I knows whar dey's two of de\r\ncaves on de place; my cow fell in one yestidy.\r\n\r\n\"When Ol' Marster Amos Travis come out here from Californy, he taken a\r\nlakin' to me an' wanted me to leave t'other side of de place an' move\r\ndown dis side of de big house to take keer of dis swamp an' look atter\r\nde han's. But I wanted a big house wid four rooms an' two brick\r\nchimneys, an' I had to talk five years to git it. I's got some\r\nrosebushes now dat was at de big house raght atter de s'rrender, an'\r\ndey's growin' in my yard now.\r\n\r\n\"Speakin' 'bout graveyard, I was passin' dere one night, ridin' on 'bout\r\nmidnight, an' sumpin' come draggin' a chain by me lak a dog. I got down\r\noff'n my horse, but couldn't see nothin' wid no chain, so I got back on\r\nde horse an' dere raght in front of me was a Jack-Me-Lantern wid de\r\nbrightes' light you ever seed. It was tryin' to lead me off, an' ev'y\r\ntime I'd git back in de road it would lead me off ag'in. You sho' will\r\ngit los' if you follow a Jack-Me-Lantern.\r\n\r\n\"One of dem led a man down to de creek by dem double bridges; said he\r\nfoun' he was travelin' in de wrong direction, gittin' frum home stidder\r\nclo'ster, so he jes' sit down under a tree an' waited 'til daylight. I\r\nain't skeered of nothin' but dem Jack-Me-Lanterns, but dey stirs you up\r\nin yo' min' till you can't tell whar you's at; an' dey's so bright dey\r\nnigh 'bout puts yo' eyes out. Dey is plenty of 'em over by de graveyard\r\nraght over yonder whar all my white folks is buried, an' mammy an'\r\npappy, too. Dey's all dere 'cept Marsa Jess Travis; he was de nex' whut\r\ncome in line for de place, an' he was de bes' frein' dis here nigger\r\never had.\r\n\r\n\"Fac' was, dat's whut he call me; 't was 'nigger'. He an' Mistus Mag\r\nlived raght dere in de big house; den dey move into town an' dat's whar\r\nhe died. Me an' Marsa Jess made a 'greement an' he said if he was de\r\nlonges' liver, he'd see me buried, an' if I be de longes' liver, I see\r\nhim buried. So dat day I went to his office in de co'thouse an' he say\r\nhe want to talk wid me. He say, 'You 'members us 'greement?' An' I say,\r\n'Whut 'greement, Marsa Jess?' An' he say, 'Bout buryin'.' Den I say,\r\nsho', 'I 'members dat.'\r\n\r\n\"Den he got up an' give me some papers 'bout some lan', an' I say, 'Whut\r\ndo all dis here mean, Marse Jess?' He say, 'nothin', nigger, 'cept I's\r\njes' goin' outta business.' Den I say, 'Goodbye, Marse Jess,' an' he\r\nsay, 'Goodbye, nigger,' an' I walked on 'crost de street. Den Mr.\r\nKillian say, 'Oliver, whut's happened over at de co'thouse?' An I say,\r\n'Ain't nothin' as I knows of.' Den he say, 'Yes, dey is; jes' look at de\r\npeoples gwine in a hurry.' Den I turn 'roun' an' run back an' dere lay\r\nMarse Jess. Mr. Smith was gettin' him up an' Marse Jess say to me,\r\n'Well, nigger, I didn't do whut I tended to; I missed it.' An' I say,\r\n'Boss, fer God's sake go to de hospital; I'll go wid you an' stay wid\r\nyou.' Mistus Mag, she ast me to beg him, but he shuck his head an' say\r\n'If I had a-wanted to live I wouldn't of shot myself.' He res' a minit,\r\nden say, 'Nigger, write Miss Calline an' tell her I says to always be\r\ngood to you as long as you lives.'\r\n\r\n\"Yassum, I was raght dere, done jes' whut I tol' him I'd do; kep' my\r\n'greement an' followed him to de grave. Co'se dat last 'bout Marse Jess\r\nain't no slavery tale, but I thought you was atter hearin' all 'bout de\r\nfamily whut owned dis ol' place; an' Marse Jess was de bes' white frein'\r\na nigger ever had; dis nigger, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNelson Birdsong\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Personal interview with Nelson and Virginia Birdsong*\r\n    *Summerville, on Front Street*\r\n    --_Ila B. Prine, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_NELSON BIRDSONG REMEMBERS HIS MASTER_\r\n\r\nNelson Birdsong, who lives on Front Street in the old suburb of\r\nSummerville, about three miles from Mobile, Alabama, was born a slave. A\r\ntall dark Negro man, with white hair and whiskers, he says he was born\r\nat Montgomery Hill, Alabama in Baldwin County, and that his people and\r\nhe were owned by Mr. Tom Adkins.\r\n\r\nNelson said he was very small at the time of the Surrender, and could\r\nnot tell very much about slavery days. In fact, he adds, \"You know,\r\nmissie, old folks in dem days did'nt 'low chillun to stan' 'roun' when\r\ndey was talking. We chillun was lack a shot out of a gun when anybody\r\ncome in. We was glad when folks come in 'cause we c'ud run out an' play.\r\nChillun now-a-days knows as much as we did when we was twenty-five years\r\nold.\"\r\n\r\nNelson does remember his \"massa\" saying he neber was going to 'let dat\r\nlittle nigger work.'\r\n\r\nHe did not remember much about coming to Mobile, but \"seemed lack\" his\r\n\"mammy worked for Mrs. Dunn on Monroe street, and later dey moved out in\r\nold Napoleonville\" (which is now Crichton, Alabama, a suburb of Mobile).\r\nHe said his \"Pa and Mammy den worked fo' gris' mill out dere, and also\r\nowned a big gris' mill in de fork whar de big fire station is now\"\r\n(which is located at the intersection of St. Francis street and\r\nWashington Avenue, the latter formerly Wilkinson street). This grist\r\nmill was burned in the 1870's.\r\n\r\nNelson says the first work he remembered doing was \"nussing a baby boy\r\nof Mr. Bramwell Burden, a gran'son of old man Burden.\"\r\n\r\nNelson has owned his little farm and three-room house until the past two\r\nor three years. He said he scuffled and tried to pay de taxes, but had\r\ngot so old and his \"knees had give out on him, and I seed I was agoin'\r\nto lose mah place so I turned it over to a man to keep up mah taxes, so\r\nI'd have a place to lib. De relief gibes me a little he'p now, an' me\r\nan' my wife makes out de bes' we can.\"\r\n\r\nThe house is the familiar type of two-room Negro house, with a porch\r\nacross the front, and a shed room on the back. The bedroom had been\r\npapered with scraps of wallpaper of varied designs and so old that most\r\nof it had fallen off. The mantel is covered with the colored comics\r\nsection, cut in a fancy pattern of scallops. At the entrance of the\r\nhouse is a sack nailed to the floor and used for a foot mat, and at the\r\ntwo upper corners of the door are horse shoes for good luck. Nelson said\r\nhe is a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and has\r\nbeen a Methodist all his life; that he and his wife Virginia \"had only\r\ntwo chillun' and dey were bofe dead.\"\r\n\r\nNelson's wife, Virginia, came from a family of slaves, although she was\r\nnot one herself. She said her folks were owned by Mr. Joe Pickett of\r\nCamden, Wilcox County, Alabama. She said she just can remember Mr. Joe\r\ntaking her in his buggy, and she called him \"Toe-Toe,\" as she couldn't\r\nsay his name plainly. She also said as she grew older she always spoke\r\nof Mr. Joe, as \"my Papa,\" instead of \"my master,\" for \"he sho' was good\r\nto me.\" She remembers her mother being chambermaid on the \"Old\r\nEleanora,\" a boat on the Alabama river, and as a small child going back\r\nand forth on the boat with her. When they finally settled in Mobile, her\r\nmother worked for the family of Dr. Heustis who lived in the corner\r\nhouse now occupied by the new Federal Court House and Custom House, at\r\nSt. Louis and St. Joseph streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnk Bishop\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Ank Bishop*\r\n    --_Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_GABR'EL BLOW SOF'! GABR'EL BLOW LOUD!_\r\n\r\nWhen \"Gabr'el take his silver trump,\" he is going to blow soft for the\r\nsaved and loud for the lost souls, according to Ank Bishop who was born\r\ninto slavery eighty-nine years ago, and lives in Livingston, Alabama.\r\nThe days before the war were as good as the present, Ank believes. He\r\ntells of them in the following story of his life:\r\n\r\n\"My name is Ank Bishop, en I was born in 1849, August 16th, at Ward,\r\nAlabama. My mother's name was Amy Larken, an' my father was Tom Bishop.\r\nI had three brothers, Alf, Volen an' Jim, an' two sisters, Cely an'\r\nMatildy. Us belonged to Lady Liza Larkin at Ward, right nigh Coke's\r\nChapel.\r\n\r\n\"My mother was brought out from South Car'lina in a speculator drove,\r\nan' Lady Liza bought her at de auction at Coke's Chapel. She lef' her\r\nmammy an' daddy back dere in South Car'lina an' never did see 'em no\r\nmore in dis life. She was bidded off an' Lady Liza got her, jes' her one\r\nfrom all her family. She was got fer Lady Liza's house gal. But\r\nsometimes she cooked or was de washer, den ag'in de milker. 'Twas my job\r\nfor to min' de ca'ves. Sometimes I went to Mr. Ed Western's sto' at\r\nGaston, three miles from us house, to see iffen was any mail for Lady\r\nLiza, but 'twa'n't none.\r\n\r\n\"Dey was good to us 'caze Lady Liza's son, Mr. Willie Larkin, was de\r\noverseer for his ma, but co'se sometime dey git among 'em an' thrashed\r\n'em out. One time one de niggers runned away, old Caesar Townsy, an' dey\r\nsarnt for Dick Peters to come an' bring his \"nigger dogs.\" Dem dogs was\r\ntrained to ketch a nigger same as rabbit dogs is trained to ketch a\r\nrabbit. So Mr. Willie Larkin told Stuart for to say to old man Dick\r\nPeters when he come, 'I'm gone,' but for him to come on. 'I'm gwineter\r\nkeep de road,' he say, 'an' cross 'Bigbee at Moscow landin'.' So ol'\r\nDick Peters, he kept de road lack he tole him to, an' he cross 'Bigbee\r\nat Moscow landin' over in de cane-brake. But dem nigger dogs didn't\r\nnever ketch ol' man Caesar. He stayed right wharever he was at 'twell\r\nafter S'render, an' de War done ceased. Den he come out, but iffen he\r\nhad a been caught, dey'd a used him up pretty rough, but he stayed hid\r\ntwell de time done passed.\r\n\r\n\"All de women on Lady Liza's place had to go to de fiel' ev'y day an'\r\ndem what had suckerlin' babies would come in 'bout nine o'clock in de\r\nmawnin' an' when de bell ring at twelve an' suckerlin' 'em. One woman\r\ntended to all of 'em in one house. Her name was Ellie Larkin, an' dey\r\ncall her 'Mammy Larkin.' She all time sarnt me down in de fiel' for to\r\ngit 'em come suckle de chillen, 'caze dat made hit hard on her when dey\r\ngets hongry an' cry.\r\n\r\n\"Us didn't get to go to church none, an' us wa'n't larnt nothin'. I'm\r\nnigh 'bout ninety an' I can't read a line. I got some chillun kin read;\r\none can't whut is sixty-five, but Henry he fifteen an' he kin. De ma,\r\nshe go by de name of Pearlie Beasley, she can't read neither, but she's\r\na good fiel' han' an' she patched dese breeches I'm wearin' an' dis ole\r\nshirt. Miss, I ain't got a coat to my name. Can't go to church, so I\r\ndoan' know dat dis any better'n slav'y time. Hit's hard, anyway you got\r\nto travel, got yo' nose on de groun' rock all de time.

De secon' time Gabr'el say,\r\n'How loud mus' I blow, Lord?' Den de Lord say, 'Blow hit as loud as\r\nseben claps of thunder all added into one echo, so as to wake up dem\r\ndamnable sper'ts sleepin' in de grave-ya'ds what ain't never made no\r\npeace wid dey God, jes' alayin' dere in dey sins.'\r\n\r\n\"But de Christ'en Army, hit gits up wid de fus' trump, an' dem what is\r\ndeef is de evil ones what anybody kin see anytime.

Dr. Lucas is one of the well known\r\nLucas family, with whom General LaFayette spent some time while touring\r\nthe United States in 1824.\r\n\r\n\"Our Marster wuz sho good to all his 'niggers',\" she said. \"Us allus had\r\nplenty to eat and plenty to wear, but de days now is hard, if white\r\nfolks gin you a nickel or dime to git you sumpin' t' eat you has to\r\nwrite everything down in a book before you can git it.

Johnson, Birmingham, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_GUS SAW MASSA'S HAT SHOT OFF_\r\n\r\n\"They is all gone, scattered, and old massa and missus have died.\" That\r\nwas the sequence of the tragic tale of \"Uncle\" Gus Brown, the body\r\nservant of William Brown; who fought beside him in the War between the\r\nStates and who knew Stonewall Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Gus\" recalled happenings on the old plantation where he was\r\nreared. His master was a \"king\" man, he said, on whose plantation in\r\nRichmond, Virginia, Uncle Gus waited on the tables at large feasts and\r\nfunctions of the spacious days before the War. He was entrusted to go\r\nwith the master's boys down to the old swimming hole and go in \"washin.\"\r\nThey would take off their clothes, hide them in the bushes on the side\r\nof the bank, put a big plank by the side of the old water hole and go in\r\ndiving, swimming and have all the fun that youngsters would want, he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nApparently his master's home was a plantation house with large columns\r\nand with all the glitter and glamour that the homes around Richmond have\r\nto offer. About it were large grain storage places for the master was a\r\ngrain dealer and men on the plantation produced and ground large\r\nquantities into flour.\r\n\r\nGus worked around the house, and he remembers well the corn shuckings as\r\nhe called them on which occasions the Negroes gave vent to emotion in\r\nthe form of dancing and music. \"On those occasions we all got together\r\nand had a regular good time,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" he was asked, \"do you remember any of the old superstitions on\r\nthe plantation? Did they have any black cat stories?\"\r\n\r\n\"No sir, boss, we was educated Negroes on our plantation. The old\r\nbossman taught his Negroes not to believe in that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n\"I well remember when de war came. Old massa had told his folks befo' de\r\nwar began dat it was comin', so we was ready for it.\r\n\r\n\"Beforehand the master called all the servants he could trust and told\r\nthem to get together all of the silver and other things of value. They\r\ndid that, he explained and afterward they took the big box of treasures\r\nand carried it out in the forest and hid it under the trunk of a tree\r\nwhich was marked. None of the Negroes ever told the Yankees where it was\r\nso when the war ended the master had his silver back. Of course the war\r\nleft him without some of the things which he used to have but he never\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\n\"Then de war came and we all went to fight the Yankees. I was a body\r\nservant to the master, and once a bullet took off his hat. We all\r\nthought he was shot but he wasn't, and I was standin' by his side all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n\"I remember Stonewall Jackson. He was a big man with long whiskers, and\r\nvery brave. We all fought wid him until his death.\r\n\r\n\"We wan't beaten, we was starved out! Sometimes we had parched corn to\r\neat and sometimes we didn't have a bite o' nothin', because the Union\r\nmens come and tuck all the food for their selves. I can still remember\r\npart of my ninety years. I remembers we fought all de way from Virginia\r\nand winded up in Manassas Gap.\r\n\r\n\"When time came for freedom most of us was glad. We liked the Yankees.\r\nThey was good to us. 'You is all now free. You can stay on the\r\nplantation or you can go.' We all stayed there until old massa died. Den\r\nI worked on de Seaboard Airline when it come to Birmingham. I have been\r\nhere ever since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gus Brown, Birmingham, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"In all de years since de war I cannot forget old massa. He was good and\r\nkind. He never believed in slavery but his money was tied up in slaves\r\nand he didn't want to lose all he had.\r\n\r\n\"I knows I will see him in heaven and even though I have to walk ten\r\nmiles for a bite of bread I can still be happy to think about the good\r\ntimes we had then. I am a Confederate veteran but my house burned up wid\r\nde medals and I don't get a pension.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, mister bossman, fer the quarter. It will buy me a little\r\ngrub.

Harper, Birmingham_\r\n\r\nLiving with her grandchildren at 801 Washington Avenue, Birmingham,\r\nAlabama, Esther King Casey, former slave of Capt. Henry King of\r\nAmericus, Georgia, recalls from fading memory a few vivid scenes of the\r\ndays when men in gray moved hurridly about the town, suddenly\r\ndisappeared for a while and then returned, one by one, with weary,\r\nhalting tread and hollow faces, while gloom and despair hovered over the\r\ntown like a pall of desolation.\r\n\r\nLess vivid in her memory are the stories told her by her grandmother of\r\na long voyage across the ocean, of the arrival in a new land called\r\nMobile, and of slaves being sold at public auction. Less vivid, too, are\r\nthe memories of her own journey to Georgia, where she, with her parents\r\nand brother, were brought to be the slaves of Captain King.\r\n\r\n\"I was only four or five years old when we came to Captain King's big\r\nhouse,\" said the old woman, brightening with pride in her ability to\r\nrecollect. Her manners bore the marks of culture and refinement, and her\r\nspeech was surprisingly void of the usual Negro dialect. She is an\r\nexample of the former slave who was educated along with the white\r\nchildren in the family.\r\n\r\n\"There were eight or ten slaves in all,\" Esther continued. \"We lived in\r\na house in the backyard of Captain King's Big House. My mamma was the\r\ncook. Papa was a mechanic. He built houses and made tools and machinery.\r\nCaptain King gave me to the 'white lady;' that was Miss Susan, the\r\nCaptain's wife. Captain King was a fine man. He treated all of us just\r\nlike his own family. The 'white lady' taught us to be respectable and\r\ntruthful.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked if she had ever been punished for misbehavior the old woman\r\nsmiled and said: \"Once the 'white lady' whipped me for playing with the\r\njailer's children. She had told me not to play with them because they\r\nwere not good company for me. She said that she wanted to raise me to be\r\ngood and truthful, and that the jailer's little white children told lies\r\nand talked bad.\"\r\n\r\nEsther remembers well the mobilization of gray-uniformed troops at the\r\ncourthouse which stood only a block from the King residence. \"The town\r\nwas filled with soldiers for several days,\" she said. \"They assembled\r\nabout the courthouse and had speakings. One day I passed there with my\r\npapa and saw Abraham Lincoln hanging from a noose in the courthouse\r\nsquare. Of course, it was only an effigy of Abraham Lincoln which was\r\nused to show what the soldiers thought of him. Papa told me that the\r\nsoldiers shot the effigy full of bullet holes before they left town.\r\n\r\n\"Before Captain King left he brought a man with him from the courthouse\r\nto value his property. The slaves were valued, too. I remember Captain\r\nKing lifting me high above his head and saying to the man: 'I wouldn't\r\ntake a thousand dollars for this little gem.'\"\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment. The light in her eyes showed that she was reliving\r\nthe thrill of that childhood incident.\r\n\r\n\"Then Captain King left with the other soldiers. Papa stayed and took\r\ncare of the 'white lady' and the house. After a while my brother ran\r\naway and joined the troops to fight for Captain King. He came back after\r\nthe war, but Captain King did not. Several years later I saw a man down\r\nin south Georgia who told me that he belonged to Captain King's troops.\r\nHe said that he was standing near him when he was killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Esther King Casey, Birmingham, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"After the proclamation the slaves were free. Most of them leased out to\r\nplantation owners. I stayed with mamma and the 'white lady.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. King had taught the little slave girl to read and write, and when\r\nschools were opened for the freed slaves she told the child's mother to\r\nsend her to school. Fees of fifty cents a month were charged, which Mrs.\r\nKing paid as long as the child remained with her. At eighteen years of\r\nage the girl had acquired sufficient education to qualify to teach in\r\nthe public schools for Negroes. After three years of teaching she\r\nmarried Jim Casey, an ex-slave, who took her to his \"three-plow\" farm in\r\nsouth Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"No man ever lived who was finer than Jim,\" said the old woman. \"My\r\ndaughter used to say that I loved him more than God, and that God was\r\njealous and took him away from me.\"\r\n\r\nAfter her only daughter's death in 1919, Esther was brought to\r\nBirmingham by her grandson who has kept her comfortably ever since. Her\r\nhair is just turning gray, though she was born in 1856. The little briar\r\npipe, which she endeavors to conceal from strangers, is the only outward\r\nevidence that she has anything in common with others of her generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmy Chapman\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Amy Chapman*\r\n    --_Ruby F. Tartt, Livingston, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_DE MASTERS GOOD, BUT OVERSEERS MEAN_\r\n\r\nAunt Amy paused as she worked among the small plants in her garden,\r\nremoving a weed here and there. She pushed back the sunbonnet that\r\nshaded her eyes and began:\r\n\r\n\"I was bawn on Governor Reuben Chapman's place five miles north of\r\nLivingston on May 14, 1843. My name is Amy Chapman. My mother was Clary\r\nChapman an' my pappy was Bob Chapman. Dey both come from Virginny; my\r\nmammy from Petersburg an' my pappy f'um Richmond.

Poole_\r\n\r\nLiving in a small room in the rear of a house at 361 Augusta Street,\r\nMobile, Alabama, the writer located an interesting ex-slave, Emma\r\nChapman, who when first approached was somewhat reticent. I soon learned\r\nI had arrived just as she was ready to have her breakfast, which\r\nconsisted of bread and coffee, and insisted she eat first and talk\r\nafterwards, as she had made just about enough fire in the open fireplace\r\nto boil the coffee.\r\n\r\nWhile she followed my suggestion I glanced about the room and found it\r\nvery neat and tidy and an unusually comfortable looking double bed, a\r\nmirrored door chifferobe and two trunks, one rocking chair and a couple\r\nof straight chairs, a table containing all cooking utensils and food\r\ncontainers. The walls were covered with sheets of manilla wrapping\r\npaper, tacked on, and part of the ceiling patched with odds and ends of\r\ncorrugated paper. Emma is small in stature, of light complexion with\r\ngreying hair arranged in neat braids around her head, very clean in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nEmma said she was about 13 years of age at the time of the surrender,\r\nand that she was born on the plantation of Rev. Mr. Montgomery Curry of\r\nCharleston, S.C. When she was about 3 years of age Mr. Curry moved to\r\nPickens County, Alabama, about 5 miles from Carrollton and 8 miles from\r\nPickenville. When I asked why they moved to Alabama, Emma laughed, and\r\nsaid they expected to find money growing on trees in Alabama, and that\r\nshe as a child came near being \"snake bit\" many a time, digging around\r\nthe roots of old trees, trying to find money.\r\n\r\nRev. Montgomery Curry, said Emma, was married to Ann Haynie, whose\r\nparents were Aaron and Francis Hudson Haynie, and Emma's grandmother was\r\nLucy Linier, who was born in Virginia and was sold to Mr. Haynie to pay\r\na debt. Lucy Linier was nurse for his daughter Ann and when she married\r\nMr. Curry, she brought Lucy with her to her new home. The Currys had\r\nthree children, a boy and two girls, and it was Lucy Linier's daughter,\r\nPatsy, who acted as their nurse.\r\n\r\nThe home of Rev. and Mrs. Montgomery Curry was a two-story log house\r\nwith wide open hall running the entire length of the house and with\r\nrooms opening off either side. The kitchen was out a short distance from\r\nthe main house, with the dairy between the two, under a large hickory\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe slave quarters were also built of logs, with space between for a\r\nshed room and small garden plot and a few chickens. The slave women did\r\nnot go to the fields on Saturday as that was their day to clean up\r\naround their homes. They usually washed their clothes at night and hung\r\nthem on the bushes where they were left to dry in the sunshine, maybe a\r\ncouple of days, as no one could or would disturb them.\r\n\r\nRev. Montgomery Curry was a Baptist preacher and had no overseer, except\r\nLucy Linier and her husband, Emma's grandparents, who kept a supervision\r\nover the slaves about 40 in number. There was no whipping allowed on the\r\nCurry plantation, and after the death of Reverend Curry, Mrs. Ann Curry\r\n(his widow) ran the plantation under the same system. The patrollers had\r\nno jurisdiction over the Curry slaves, they were given permits by the\r\nCurrys to go and come, and Emma said if one of those patrollers whipped\r\none of \"ole Miss's slaves, she would have sure sued them.\r\n\r\nEmma laughingly said the slaves on other plantations always said the\r\nCurry slaves were \"free niggers,\" as they could always get permits, and\r\nhad plenty to eat and milk to drink. The slaves cooked their breakfasts\r\nin their own cabins, but dinner and supper was cooked in the kitchen and\r\neach came with their pan to be filled and had their own gourds which\r\nwere grown on the place to drink their milk and of which they could have\r\nfull and plenty.\r\n\r\nDuring the war they cooked for the Confederate soldiers encamped nearby\r\nand great quantities were prepared. Emma was one of those delegated to\r\ncarry the food to the camp. All she ever saw of the Yankees were two who\r\nstopped at the house and asked for something to eat. Mrs. Montgomery\r\ninvited them in and served the best she had. One of the men wanted to\r\ntake the last mule she had and the other said \"No, Mrs. Montgomery is a\r\nwidow and from the appearance of her slaves she has treated them well.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Montgomery told them that someone had stolen her saddle horse and\r\nthe soldier who had remonstrated with the other replied: \"Madam, your\r\nsaddle horse will be returned in three weeks,\" and sure enoug, one night\r\nabout midnight they heard a horse whinny and Emma's grandfather said\r\n\"there is old Spunk,\" and there was old Spunk waiting outside.\r\n\r\nEmma said the first whipping she ever had, was after the Surrender,\r\ngiven her by her own father when they left Alabama and went to live near\r\nColumbus, Miss.\r\n\r\nShe had always lived in the house with the \"old Miss\" and her young\r\nMiss, and when she had to leave them, she cried and so did they.\r\n\r\nHer grandmother Lucy Linier nursed \"Miss Ann\"; Lucy's daughter Patsy\r\nnursed \"Miss Ann's\" children, and was the special property of Fannie\r\nMontgomery Curry, who married a Mr. Sidney Lipscomb and whose children\r\nEmma helped to look after, so the three generations were interwoven.\r\n\r\nEmma only wishes she could go back to plantation days. All her trials\r\nand suffering came after she left \"Ole Miss,\" and went to live with her\r\nfather and mother, George and Patsy Curry, who had fourteen children and\r\nof which Emma was the eldest. Her father who was a quadroon in cast was\r\ncruel to his family, and especially so to her. He made her work like a\r\nman, cutting timber, splitting rails, digging, planting and all work of\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\nNow, Emma is the only member of her family left. She married three\r\ntimes, having only two children, a girl and a boy, these by her last\r\nhusband, Frank Chapman, now dead, and Emma has no knowledge of her\r\nchildren's whereabouts. She gave them an education so they could write\r\nto her if they wanted to. The girl married and left Mobile, the boy went\r\nto Chicago, was chauffeur for some rich folks. His last letter several\r\nyears ago, in which he enclosed $25.00, stated he was going on a trip to\r\nJerusalem with one of the young men of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Cheatam\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Henry Cheatam*\r\n    --_Ila B. Prine_\r\n\r\n_I HEARD LINCOLN SET US FREE_\r\n\r\n\"White folks, I'se glad you drapped by to have a talk wid me. I was\r\ngittin' powerfully lonely,\" said Henry Cheatam, who lives in Marysville,\r\na Mobile suburb. \"Sho' I'll be glad to tell you some about de slave\r\ndays. I sho' 'members plenty. Well, to begin wid, I was born in 1850\r\nnear West Point. Dat's in Clay County, Mississippi, you know. I b'longed\r\nto Mr. Tom Hollingshead who was killed in de Cibil War. I 'members all\r\nde slaves agoin' in to take a last look at him atter dey done brung his\r\nbody home.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy's name was Emmeline Cheatam, an' my pappy's was Sam Cheatam. I\r\ndon't remember my grandpappy an' grandmammy atall.\r\n\r\n\"Us slaves libed in log cabins what was daubed wid clay to keep de rain\r\nan' win' out, an' de chimneys was made of clay an' sticks. De beds was\r\nhome-made an' nailed agin' de wall wid legs on de outer side. De Massa's\r\nhouse was build of logs too, but it was much bigger'n de nigger cabins\r\nan' sot way out in front of ourn. Atter de massa was kilt, old Miss had\r\na nigger oberseer an' dat was de meanest debil dat eber libbed on de\r\nLawd's green yearth. I promise myself when I growed up dat I was agoin'\r\nto kill dat nigger iffen it was de las' thing I eber done. Lots of times\r\nI'se seen him beat my mammy, an' one day I seen him beat my Auntie who\r\nwas big wid a chile, an' dat man dug a roun' hole in de groun' an' put\r\nher stummick in it, an' beat an' beat her for a half hour straight till\r\nthe baby come out raght dere in de hole.\r\n\r\n\"Why de Mistis 'low such treatment? A heap of times ole Miss didn't know\r\nnuthin' 'bout it, an' de slaves better not tell her, 'caze dat oberseer\r\nwhup 'em iffen he finds out dat dey done gone an' tol'. Yassun, white\r\nfolks, I'se seed some turrible things in my time. When de slaves would\r\ntry to run away our oberseer would put chains on dere legs wid big long\r\nspikes tween dere feets, so dey couldn't git away. Den I's seen great\r\nbunches of slaves put up on de block an' sol' jus' lak dey was cows.\r\nSometimes de chilluns would be seprated from dere maws an' paws.\r\n\r\n\"I come pretty near to bein' tuk away from my maw. When de slaves was\r\nbein' 'vided, one of ole Miss' datters was agoin' to Texas, an' I was\r\ngoin' to have to go when somebody hollered 'Freedom', an' I sho' was\r\nglad 'caze I could stay wid my mammy now.\r\n\r\n\"In dose days us had plenty of good, plain food; such as pot likker,\r\ngreens, cornbread, 'taters, peas, pears, an' at hog killin' us had\r\nchittlin's an' pig jowls an' back bone. Den us would cotch 'possums at\r\nnight when dey come up in de corn fiel'. Us neber seed no flour dough.\r\n\r\n\"As for fishin', we neber did none, 'caze we hadda work too hard. We\r\nworked from 'can to can't.' Git up at sunrise, go to de fiel' an' stay\r\ntill dark. In de middle of de day dey would sen' our somp'n t'eat to de\r\nfiel' wid a barrel of water. But for breakfas' an' supper, us hadda cook\r\nour own grub dey gib us.\r\n\r\n\"Our clo's warn't many. Us chilluns wo' a one-piece suit made outen\r\nosnaburg, an' us would hab to take dat off at night, wash it an' put it\r\nback on de nex' day. As for shoes, chillun neber had none. You see,\r\nwhite folks, I was jus' a chile, jus' big enough to tote water to de\r\nfiel's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Henry Cheatam, Marysville, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"I 'members when de Yankees was acomin' th'ough I hoped to ca'y de\r\nhosses to de woods an' hoped to hide de meat an' bury de valu'bles,\r\n'caze dem Yankees tuk whatever dey wanted, an' you better not say\r\nnothin' neither 'caze dey had dem long swyords ahangin' at dere sides.\r\n\r\n\"In dem days, de slaves done all de work an' carried all de news. De\r\nmarsters sont notes from one plantation to anudder, an' when dey wanted\r\nde niggers to come to de Big House dey would blow an ole cow horn. Dey\r\nhad certain number of blows for certain niggers. Dat is, de niggers dat\r\nwas somp'n. Dey would also use dis horn for 'possum an' coon huntin' at\r\nnight. De li'l niggers at night went to de big house to spin an' weave.\r\nI'se spun a many roll an' carded a many bat of cotton. I'se also made a\r\nmany tallow candle by tyin' strings onto a long stick an' droppin dem\r\ndown into moulds filled wid tallow. I'se hid many a night in de fence\r\ncorners when I'd be agoin' som'ers to git my mammy some 'bacco. De\r\npattyrollers would be out lookin' for slaves dat didn't hab no pass from\r\ndere oberseer, an' I'd hear dem acomin' an' I'd hide till dey pass on,\r\n'caze iffen dey cotch me I sho' gwine have a sound beatin'.\r\n\r\n\"De owners always tuk care of us, and when us got sick dey would git a\r\ndoctor, an' ole Miss was all right, but dat oberseer was a debil. He\r\nwouldn't 'low no meetin' on de place. Sometimes us would slip down de\r\nhill an' turn de wash pot bottom up'ards so de soun' of our voices would\r\ngo under de pot, an' us'd have a singin' an' prayin' raght dere.\r\n\r\n\"Mos' of de slave could go sometimes to de white folks church when dey\r\ngits a pass from dere Massa, but dat mean oberseer always tried to keep\r\nus from goin' so's us couldn't learn nothin'. He didn't want us to learn\r\nto read or write neither.\r\n\r\n\"No'm us didn't have nothin' lak matches till I was growed. Us used\r\nflint rocks an' cotton to start de fires.\r\n\r\n\"Us didn't have nothin' but food an' clothes.

Dat\r\nwas de bigges' day of de year.\r\n\r\n\"On Sat'day afternoon we was 'lowed to play, but I can't 'member none of\r\nde games. Us jus' played lak all li'l niggers did den. At night time us\r\njus' went to our cabins an' went to bed, 'caze we warn't 'lowed to do no\r\nsinging. Mos' of de singin' was done in de fiel's.\r\n\r\n\"Cornshuckin' time come when dey wanted to git de seed corn for\r\nplantin', an' us would commence de shuckin' when it commence rainin'.\r\n\r\n\"You axed me 'bout funerals an' weddin's. Us niggers nebber ma'ied an'\r\ndon't 'member any big weddin's of de white folks. But dey buried folks\r\nden de same as dey does now, in a box. Dey would bury de slaves same as\r\ndey done de white folks, but us didn't eben have no babtizin' on 'count\r\nof dat oberseer. He didn't lak for us to git no religion. Cose all\r\nslaves didn't have hard treatment lak us did, 'caze dere oberseer an'\r\nMarster warn't as mean as ourn.\r\n\r\n\"No'm we didn't know nothin' 'bout no hoodoo stuff in dem days. Dey only\r\nhad homemade medicines, dat is unless dey got sho' nuff powerful sick\r\nan' den dey would go to see a doctor. Us used bone-set tea made from a\r\nweed. Lawd, it was bitterer dan quinine, an' it were good for de chills\r\nan' fever, an' it would purge you too.

My pappy say: 'What in de Hell am dat?'\r\nan' snapped his fingers at de dog. De dog he den dropped daid.

But, Mister, de peoples was de same as dey is now. Dere was good\r\nuns and bad uns. I jus' happened to belong to a bad un.

'Don't it hurt?'\r\n\r\n\"January, he neber said nothin', and de massa keep a beatin' till little\r\nstreams of blood started flowin' down January's chest, but he neber\r\nholler. His lips was a quiverin' and his body was a shakin', but his\r\nmouf it neber open; and all de while I sat on my mammy's and pappy's\r\nsteps a cryin'. De niggers was all gathered about and some uv 'em\r\ncouldn't stand it; dey hadda go inside dere cabins. Atter while,\r\nJanuary, he couldn't stand it no longer hisself, and he say in a hoarse,\r\nloud whisper:\r\n\r\n\"'Massa! Massa! have mercy on dis poor nigger.'\r\n\r\nWill's eyes narrowed down to fine creases as his thick lips came\r\ntogether in smacking noises, and the loose skin beneath his chin, and\r\njaws seemed to shake with the impact of dread memories.\r\n\r\n\"Den,\" he continued, after a brief pause in which time there was no\r\nsound except the constant drop of a bead of water in a lard bucket, \"de\r\nwar came.

Seem to me\r\nlak dey jes' stay aroun' long enough to git plenty somp'n t'eat, kaze\r\ndey lef' in two or three days, an' we neber seed 'em since. De massa had\r\nthree boys to go to war, but dere wasn't one to come home. All the\r\nchillun he had was killed. Massa, he los' all his money and de house\r\nsoon begin droppin' away to nothin'.

In front of her one-room cabin is\r\na neat garden of vegetables and flowers combined, with morning glories\r\ntrained carefully over the fence nearly all the way around. There is a\r\nsaying in the South, that cotton will grow better for a Negro than for\r\nany other race, and this might well be extended to include morning\r\nglories in Aunt Tildy's case; since none in Uniontown are quite so fine\r\nin growth or brilliance of coloring.\r\n\r\nLike nearly all old Negroes, Aunt Tildy goes to sleep very readily. She\r\nwas dozing in a rocker on her small porch, while the scent of wood smoke\r\nand the odor of boiling vegetables issued from the cabin. An iron pot,\r\nhanging from a crane in the fireplace, sending forth clouds of steam and\r\nan appetizing aroma. She clings to old fashioned equipment and disdains\r\na stove for cooking. Her \"biled\" vegetables or meats in the hanging pot,\r\nwith baked potatoes and \"pone\" bread from the oven make up a meal that\r\nleaves little to be desired, as many visitors who have shared her\r\nrepasts well know.\r\n\r\nAs the gate squeaked, Aunt Tildy awoke with a start and a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, white folks, I was jes' a-settin' here waitin' for my greens\r\nto bile, an' I musta drapped off to sleep. Set down in dat cheer right\r\ndar, an' tek off your hat; you sho' is lookin' well, an' I'se proud to\r\nsee you.\r\n\r\n\"Yas, ma'am, I sho' was borned in slavery times, an' I wish to Gawd I\r\ncould git now what I useter hab den, 'caze dem was good times for de\r\nblack folks. Dese free niggers don't know what 'tis to be tuk good keer\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\"Co'se I means dat! I was borned on a big plantation near 'bout to\r\nLinden, an' my Ole Marster was name Harris, yassum, Dick Harris, an' my\r\nOle Mistis was Miss Mandy. Bofe dey boys fit in de wah, an' I 'members\r\nwhen dey went off wid de sojers, ole Mistis she cry an' hug dem boys an'\r\nkiss 'em goodbye, an' dey was gone a long time. I was a leetle gal\r\nwhenst dey went to de wah, an' I was mos' a grown 'oman when dey come\r\nhome, an' dey bofe had whiskers. Young Massa Richard he limpin' an' look\r\nmighty pale, an' dey say he been wounded an' stay in prison on Mister\r\nJohnson's island, summuz up de ribber; but Marse Willis, he look all\r\nright, 'cep'in' whiskers. Ole Marster had a big house, an' dat same\r\nhouse standin' dar right now. Us had plenty to eat an' plenty to wear,\r\nan' dat's mo'n what some folks got now.\r\n\r\n\"Ole Marster was good to all he niggers, an' my pappy and mammy bofe\r\nbelonged to him. Dey was a slave-yard in Uniontown, an' ev'y time a\r\nspec'later cum wid a lot of new niggers, Ole Marster he buy four or five\r\nniggers, an' dat's how he come to buy my pappy, atter de spec'later\r\nbrung him an' a whole passel of niggers from North C'lina. My mammy here\r\nalready 'long to Ole Marster. Her was borned his'n.\r\n\r\n\"Sometime a no 'count nigger tek an' runned erway; but de oberseer, he\r\nput de houn's on he track, an' dey run him up a tree, an' de oberseer\r\nfetch him back nex' mawnin', all tuckerd out, an' he' glad to stay home\r\nfor a spell an' 'have hese'f. Ole Marster had a good oberseer, too.\r\n'Cose he wan't no quality, lak Ole Marster an' Ole Mistis, but he was a\r\ngood, kin' man an' he didn't hab no trouble on de whole plantation.\r\n\r\n\"Us alluz had a Chris'mus tree in de quarter, jes' lak de white folks\r\nan' dey was presents for ev'ybody--nobody wan't lef' out, big or little.\r\nDere was a meetin' house on de plantation an' Ole Marster had a rule dat\r\nall de chilluns had to go to Sunday school soon as dey was big 'nuff,\r\nan' dey had to go in clean white clo'se, too. Us chilluns hate to see\r\nSunday come, 'caze Mammy an' Granmammy dey wash us an' near 'bout rub de\r\nskin off gittin' us clean for Sunday school, an' dey comb our heads wid\r\na jimcrow. You ain't neber seed a jimcrow? Hit mos' lak a card what you\r\ncard wool wid. What a card look lak? Humph! Missy, whar you been\r\nraise--ain't neber seed a card? Dat jimcrow sho' did hurt, but us hadder\r\nstan' hit, an' sometimes atter all dat, Mammy she wrap our kinky hair\r\nwid t'read an' twis' so tight us's eyes couldn't hardly shet.\r\n\r\n\"My Granmammy, her de head cook 'oman at de big house, an' us had to\r\nmine her lak us did Mammy. I ho'p Granmammy in de kitchen, atter I got\r\nbig 'nuff an' she sho' did keep me humpin'. Chilluns had to mine dey\r\nolders in dem days. Dey wan't lak dey is now, don't mine nobody, not\r\neben dey Pa.\r\n\r\n\"When de surrender come, Ole Marster he tole all de niggers dey was free\r\nnow, an' some was glad an' some was sorry an' welst dey might be sorry,\r\niffen dey knowed what a hard time dey goner had knockin' 'roun' de worl'\r\nby deyself; no Ole Marster an' no Ole Mistis ter look atter 'em an' feed\r\n'em when dey sick an' when dey well. Look lak ter me, when de surrender\r\nparted de white folks an' de black folks, it hurt 'em bofe. Dey oughter\r\nbe tergedder, jes' lak de Good Lord 'tended dey be.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Tildy sighed deeply and, gazing afar off, said: \"Iffen Ole Marster\r\nwas livin' now, I'd be all right an' not hafter worry 'bout nuffin.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her eighty-four years, Aunt Tildy makes her living as a\r\nmid-wife and serves as a \"doctor man\" in cases of minor ailments; but\r\nher practice is so closely interwoven with \"conju'in'\" that it is\r\ndifficult to say which is the more important to her. For example: she\r\nprescribes wearing matches in the hair or a little salt on the mole of\r\nthe head for headache. Her sovereign remedy for rheumatism is \"'nint de\r\nj'ints wid a little kerosene oil an' put some mullen leaves on it.\" \"A\r\ngood dost of turpentine is good for mos' anything de matter wid you.\" A\r\ncoin with a hole in it, usually a dime, tied around the ankle will keep\r\nyou from getting \"pizen.\" Furthermore, this same treatment warns against\r\nthe ill effects of getting \"conju'ed.\" \"Iffen you gits conju'ed, de dime\r\nturn black, an' you kin go to de conju' doctor an' git de conju' took\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is you got to go, Missy? Come back agin. I's allus proud to see you,\"\r\nAunt Tildy called after me from the edge of the porch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSara Colquitt\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Sara Colquitt*\r\n    --_Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_SHE JUST CAN REMEMBER HER HUSBAND'S NAME_\r\n\r\nSara Colquitt, who used to till the fields in slavery days, now has a\r\nhandmaiden of her own. Sara does not know the date of her birth in\r\nRichmond, Virginia, but she says it was more than a century ago. (1937).\r\nThe \"girl,\" whom her daughter has employed to take care of the nearly\r\nblind and helpless centenarian, is well past eighty herself, yet she\r\nkeeps her charge neat and clean and the cabin in which they live tidy.\r\nSara's daughter works in the fields nearby at Opelika, Ala. to keep the\r\nfamily going.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bill Slaughter and Miss Mary Slaughter was our marster and mistess\r\nand dey had two chilluns, Marsa Robert and Marsa Brat,\" Sara said. \"I\r\nhad four brothers and sisters, Tate, Sam, Jennie, and Tenner. Us lived\r\nin log cabins wid dirt floors and dey was built in two long rows. Us\r\nbeds was nailed to de wall at one end and us used corn shucks and pine\r\nstraw for mattresses.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Mary was good to us, but us had to work hard and late. I worked in\r\nde fields every day from 'fore daylight to almost plumb dark. I usta\r\ntake my littlest baby wid me. I had two chilluns, and I'd tie hit up to\r\na tree limb to keep off de ants and bugs whilst I hoed and worked de\r\nfurrow. All us niggers was fed from de big kitchen and wasn't hongry,\r\nbut sometimes us would steal more food dan was give us anyhow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sara Colquitt, Opelika, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"I was one of de spinners, too, and had to do six cuts to de reel at de\r\ntime and do hit at night plenty times. Us clothes was homespun osnaburg,\r\nwhat us would dye, sometimes solid and sometimes checked.\r\n\r\n\"'Sides working de fields and spinning, sometimes I'd ho'p wid de\r\ncooking up at de Big House when de real cook was sick or us had a passel\r\nof company. Us cooked on a great, big fireplace what had arms hanging\r\nout over de coals to hang pots on to bile. Den us had three-legged\r\nskillets what set right over de coals for frying and sech like. Us\r\ncooked sho' 'nuff bread in dem days, ash cakes, de best thing you ever\r\net. Dey ain't nothing like dat dese days.\r\n\r\n\"I was sold oncet before I left Virginia. Den I was brung down to\r\nAlabama and sold from de block for $1,000 to Mr. Sam Rainey, at Camp\r\nHill, Ala. I still worked in de fields, but I would cook for de white\r\nfolks and hope around de Big House on special 'casions. Our overseer was\r\nMr. Green Ross, and he was a bad one, too. Mean, my goodness! He'd whup\r\nyou in a minute. He'd put you in de buck, tie your feet and den set out\r\nto whup you right.\r\n\r\n\"He would get us slaves up 'fore day, blowing on his big horn, and us\r\nwould work 'twell plumb dark. All de little niggers'd get up, too, and\r\ngo up to de Big House to be fed from wooden bowls. Den dey'd be called\r\nag'in 'fore us come from de fields and put to bed by dark. I useta stop\r\nby de spring house to get de milk, it was good cold too, and tote it up\r\nto de Big House for dinner.\r\n\r\n\"I had two chilluns. Dey was named Lou and Eli, and dey was took care of\r\nlike de rest. Us useta have some good times. Us could have all de fun us\r\nwanted on Sa'dday nights, and us sho' had it, cutting monkeyshines and\r\ndancing all night long sometimes. Some would pat and sing, 'Keys not\r\narunning, Keys not arunning,\" and us sho' did more'n dance, I'm telling\r\nyou. Sometimes our Mistess would come down early to watch us dance.\r\n\r\n\"Next to our dances, de most fun was corn-shucking. Marsa would have de\r\ncorn hauled up to de cribs and piled as a house. Den he would invite de\r\nhands 'round to come and ho'p shuck it. Us had two leaders or generals\r\nand choose up two sides. Den us see which side would win first and\r\nholler and sing. I disremembers the hollers jest now. My mind is sorter\r\nmissing. Marsa would pass de jug 'round, too. Den dey sho' could work\r\nand dat pile'd just vanish.\r\n\r\n\"Us used de white folks' church in de morning. I j'ined de church den,\r\n'cause I always tried to live right and wid de Lord.\r\n\r\n\"When de Yankees come through Dadeville, Ala., us heard 'bout hit and\r\nMarsa hid his money and lots of his fine things in de colored folks's\r\nhouses. Dey never found 'em neither.\r\n\r\n\"Lemme see who I married? I mighty nigh forgot who it was I did marry.\r\nNow, I knows. Hit was Prince Hodnett.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I don't want no more slavery.

Wasn't much whippin' went on 'roun' our plantation, but on\r\nsome places close to us, they whipped until blood run down. Some places\r\nthey even mixed salt an' pepper in water an' bathed 'em with it. The\r\nsalt water'd heal, but when the pepper got in there, it burned lak fire,\r\nan' they'd as well get on to work quick, cause they can't be still\r\nnohow.\r\n\r\n\"One woman, on a plantation not so far from us, was expectin', an' they\r\ntied her up under a hack-a-berry tree, an' whipped her until she died.\r\nMos' any time at night ef you go 'roun' that tree, you could hear that\r\nbaby cry.

The older part of the house is the \"settin'\r\nroom\" where the stick-and-clay chimney of its earlier days has been\r\nreplaced by a new brick chimney. A roof of corrugated sheet metal tops\r\nthe warped, roughly hewn logs which form the walls. The \"new room\" is\r\nbuilt in the later shanty style--pine boards, unplaned, and nailed\r\nupright to a frame of 2X4's, the cracks of the flat joints \"stripped\"\r\nwith narrow siding. A roof of \"bought\" shingles covers this room.\r\nConnecting the two rooms is an open hall roofed with heavy boards\r\n\"rived\" from pine blocks. Despite its conglomerate architecture this is\r\na better \"colored folks'\" house than many in the Black Belt. These\r\n\"double houses\" often have no roof for the hall and some also lack a\r\nfloor, the hall being made entirely of earth, sky and imagination.\r\n\r\nEmma settled herself on the top step at the front of the hall to talk to\r\nme, after first ironing a tiny wrinkle out of her \"string apron\" with\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Emma Crockett, Livingston, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Miss, I'm 'bout sebenty-nine or eighty year old,\" she told me, \"and I\r\nbelonged to Marse Bill Hawkins and Miss Betty.

She look\r\nat it an' wag her tail so fas' an' say: \"Ma-a-a-a-a!\" Den she lay down\r\non de flo' whilst us holes her feets an' let de baby suck de milk. All\r\nde time dat goat bees talkin', 'Ma-a-a-a-a,' twell dat baby got\r\nsatchified.\r\n\r\n\"When us chillun got tuck wid any kind of sickness or zeezes, us tuck\r\nazzifizzity an' garlit. You know, garlit what smell lack onions. Den we\r\nwore some roun' us necks. Dat kep' off flu-anz.\r\n\r\n\"Dese days it look lack somepin t'eat don't tas'e lack dat we cooked\r\nback yonder. De coffee us used had to be fresh groun' ever' day. An'\r\nwhen it commence to bile, I put dese here knees down on de flo' befo' de\r\nfire an' stir dat coffee for de longes'. Den my gran'ma she hung dat pot\r\nup on dem pot hooks over de fire an' washed de meat an' drap it in. Time\r\nshe done pick an' overlook de greens an' den wrinched 'em in spring\r\nwater, de meat was bilin'. Den she take a great big mess of dem fresh\r\nturnip greens an' squash 'em down in dat pot. Dey jes' melt down an' go\r\nto seasonin'.\r\n\r\n\"Nex' thing I knowed, here come my mistis, an' she say: 'Now Cheney, I\r\nwants some pone bread for dinner.' Dem hick'ry coals in dat fire place\r\nwas all time ready an' hot. They wouldn't be no finger prints lef' on\r\ndat pone when Cheney got th'ew pattin' it out neither. Better not! Look\r\nlack dem chillun jes' couldn't git 'nuff of dat hard corn bread.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of fancy cookin' went on 'roun' dat fire place, but somehow de\r\npot licker an' pone bread longside wid de fresh buttermilk stirs my\r\nmem'ry worse'n anything.\r\n\r\n\"All dis good eatin' I'se speakin' 'bout tuck place befo' de Yankees\r\nraided us. It was den, too, dat my mistis tuck me down to de spring back\r\nof de house. Down dere it was a holler tree stump, taller'n you is. She\r\ntell me to clam' up to de top of dat holler tree, den she han' me a big\r\nheavy bundle, all wropped up an' tied tight. Hit sho' was heavy! Den she\r\nsay: 'Drap it in, Cheney.' I didn't know den whut she's up to, but dat\r\nwas de silver an' jew'lry she was hidin'.\r\n\r\n\"Yes honey, I 'members dat Yankee raid lack it was jes' yistiddy. I'se\r\nsettin' dere in de loom room, an' Mr. Thad Watts' lil' gal, Louise,\r\nshe's standin' at the winder. She say: 'O-o-oh! Nannie! Jes' look down\r\nyonder!' 'Baby, what is dat?' I says. 'Dem's de Yankees comin'!' 'Gawd\r\nhep us!' I says, an' befo' I kin ketch my bref, de place is kivvered.\r\nYou couldn't stir 'em up wid a stick. Feets sounded lack mutterin'\r\nthunder. Dem bayonets stick up lack dey jes' setting on de mouf of dey\r\nguns. Dey swords hangin' on dey sides singin' a chune whilst dey walk. A\r\nchicken better not pass by. Iffen he do, off come his head!\r\n\r\n\"When dey pass on by me, dey put' nigh shuck me outa my skin. 'Where's\r\nde men's?' dey say an' shake me up. 'Where's de arms?' Dey shake me\r\ntwell my eye balls loosen up. 'Where's de silver?' Lawd! Was my teefs\r\ndrappin' out? Dey didn't give me time to ketch my bref. All de time,\r\nMiss Mary jes' look 'em in de eye an' say nothin'!\r\n\r\n\"Dey tuck dem enfield rifles, half as long as dat door, an' bus' in de\r\nsmoke house winder. Dey jack me up off'n my feet an' drag me up de\r\nladder an' say: 'Git dat meat out.' I kep' on th'owin' out Miss Mary's\r\nhams an' sawsidges, twell dey holler 'stop'. I come backin' down dat\r\nladder lack a squirrel, an' I ain't stop backin' twell I retch Miss\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Lawd! Dem Yankees loaded up a waggin full of meat an' tuck de\r\nwhole barrel of 'lasses! Takin' dat 'lasses kilt us chillun! Our mainest\r\n'musement was makin' 'lasses candy. Den us cake walk 'roun' it. Now dat\r\nwas all gone. Look lack dem sojers had to sharpen dey swords on\r\never'thing in sight. De big crepe mullen bush by de parlor winder was\r\nbloomin' so pink an' pretty, an' dey jes' stood dere an' whack off dem\r\nblooms lack folkses heads drappin' on de groun'.\r\n\r\n\"I seed de sargeant when he run his bayonet clean th'ew Miss Mary's\r\nbestest feather bed an' rip it slam open! Wid dat, a win' blowed up an'\r\ntuck dem feathers ever' which away for Sunday. You couldn't see where\r\nyou's at. De sargeant, he jes' th'owed his head back an' laugh fit to\r\nkill hisse'f. Den fust thing next, he done suck a feather down his\r\nwin'pipe! Lawd, honey, dat white man sho' struggled. Dem sojers th'owed\r\nwater in his face. Dey shuck'm an' beat'm an' roll'm over, an' all de\r\ntime he's gettin' limberer an' bluerer. Den dey jack him up by his feets\r\nan' stan'm on his haid. Den dey pump him up an' down. Den dey shuck'm\r\ntwell he spit. Den he come to.\r\n\r\n\"Dey didn't cut no mo' mattrusses. An' dey didn't cut nothin' much up in\r\nde parlor, 'cause dat's where de lieutenant an' de sargeant slep'. But\r\ndey lef' de nex' day, de whole place was strewed wid mutilation.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members well back dere in jewin' de war how ever' oncet a month that\r\ncome 'roun' a big box, longer'n I is an' wider too, was tuck to our\r\nsojer boys on de battle fiel'.

Den you see a mother's bres' heave wid her\r\nsilent prayer.\r\n\r\n\"Directly atter de surrender, de Ku Kluxes sho' was bad atter de\r\nYankees. Dey do all sorts of things to aggivate 'em. Dey's continual'\r\ntyin' grape vines crost de road, to git 'em tangled up an' make 'em trip\r\nup an' break dey own necks. Dat was bad too, 'cause dem poor Yankees\r\nnever s'picioned no better'n dat dem vines jes' blowed down or somepin.\r\n\r\n\"'Long about den, too, seem lack ha'nts an' spairits was ridin'\r\never'thing! Dey raided mostly 'roun' de grabeyard. Lawd, honey, I ain't\r\nhankerin' atter passin' by no grabeyards. 'Cose, I knows I got to go in\r\ndere some day, but dey do make me feel lonesome an' kinder jubus.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members one night, way back dere, when I'se walkin' down de big road\r\nwid Bud, an' he say: 'Look!

Here resides in peace and tranquility Aunt Matilda\r\nPugh Daniel, an old Negro slave, aged 96 years. Aunt Matilda was a full\r\ngrown buxom gal when the War between the States was raging. She belonged\r\nto United States Senator, James L. Pugh, and was born on his plantation,\r\nnear Eufaula. Even though time has dimmed her sight, and slightly\r\ndiminished her hearing powers, she is still active of mind and accurate\r\nin her memories. We will let her speak for herself:\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, white folks, I remembers lots of things dat happen in de\r\nslabery times. I works aroun' de house for mistis, who was de daughter\r\nof Gen'l John Linguard Hunter befo' she ma'ied de massa. When I was a\r\nlittle pig-tailed nigger, I usta play 'roun' wid Massa's chilluns. We\r\nplay injuns in de woods, an' buil' dams down on de creek an' swing in de\r\nyard an' sometime we sho do devilish things. We hid red pepper in ole\r\nBlack Bob's chewin' bacca, an' you ought to seed de faces he made. It\r\nmakes me laugh still yit. Den we tuken a skunk dat us little white an'\r\nblack debils kotched an' turn him loose in de slave quarters. You ought\r\nter seed dem niggers come a flyin' outer dere. Dey come out like a swarm\r\nof wet antses.\r\n\r\n\"Atter I grew up I ma'ied Joe Daniel, a house nigger, an' Gen'l Hunter,\r\nde Mistis's pappy 'formed de ceremony. We was ma'ied in de parlor, an' I\r\nwo' a party dress of Miss Sara's. It sho' was purty; made outen white\r\ntarleton wid a pink bow in de front. I had a pink ribbon 'roun' my haid\r\ntoo, an' Joe, he look proud of me. Atter de weddin' all de niggers on de\r\nplantation gathered about an' we had a soiree in de back yard. Me an'\r\nJoe moved to de quarter den, but I still worked in de house. Mistis\r\nwarn't goin' ter let nobody wash dem julep glasses but me, an' warn't\r\nnobody a goin' ter polish dat silber but dis here nigger. Nawsuh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Matilda Pugh Daniel, Eufaula, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Durin' de war us warn't bothered much, but atter de surrender, some po'\r\nwhite trash tried to make us take some lan'. Some of 'em come to de\r\nslave quarters, an' talk to us. Dey say 'Niggers, you is jus' as good as\r\nde white fo'ks. You is 'titled to vote in de 'lections an' to have money\r\nsame as dey,' but most of us didn't pay no 'tention to 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Den Massa James an' Mistis moved to Washington, an' Miss Sara wanted me\r\nto go wid her to be her house maid. She said she'd pay me money fo' it,\r\nbut I couldn't leave my ole man, Joe, kaze he had a case of consumption.\r\nJoe died a year later an' lef' me wid fo' little chilluns. Us stayed\r\n'roun' on de plantation an' de new massa paid us good money fo' workin',\r\nbut soon de house kotched fire an' burn to de groun', an' I have to move\r\nto Eufaula. I bought dis little house wid de money I saved. I has\r\nkinfolks in Detroit dat sen's me a little money, an' some good peoples\r\nin Eufaula helps me out some so I is in purty good financial shape. I\r\nain't neber 'sociated wid no trashy niggers an' I ain't neber 'ten' to.\r\nI is goin' to be a proud an' good nigger to de las'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarrie Davis\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Carrie Davis*\r\n    --_Preston Klein, Lee County, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_PLANTATION PUNISHMENT_\r\n\r\nCarrie Davis said \"Honey, dere was a lot of cruel things done in slavery\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\nShe was washing when I arrived at her shanty near Smith's Station,\r\nAlabama. She asked, as so many of the old Negroes do, \"Has you come to\r\nhelp me?\" I said: \"No, Carrie; I want you to tell me about slavery.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her gray head, recalled: \"Dem was good an' bad times, Mistus;\r\ngood an' bad. I had a purty good marster; but de marster on de\r\nplantation dat j'ined our'n was mighty mean. He was a bad man, no matter\r\nif de slaves behaved or not.\r\n\r\n\"Honey, I 'members dat he had regular days to whup all de slaves wid\r\nstrops. De strops had holes in 'em so dat dey raised big blisters. Den\r\ndey took a hand saw, cut de blisters and washed 'em in salt water. Our\r\nOl' Mistus has put salve on aheap of backs so dey could git deir shirts\r\noff. De shirts'd stick, you see. De slaves would come to our house for\r\nwater an' Mistus would see 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about her life as a slave, she said: \"I was borned in Harris\r\nCounty, Georgia, an' was 'bout ten or twelve when freedom come. My mammy\r\nan' pappy was Martha an' Nathan Perry and had seben chillun. Besides me,\r\ndere was Amy, Ida, Knoxie, Jim, Abraham, an' Franklin.\r\n\r\n\"Us lived in de Perry quarters. De cabins was made of split logs, put up\r\nedgeways and daubed wid mud inside an' out. Dey was 'bout a hundred\r\nyards from de big house, whar Marster Billy an' Mistus Nancy Perry\r\nlived. Deir chillun was Clara Maria, Malinda, Sara, Alec, Jim, an' Bill.\r\nDey was real good to us, too. Us et at de big house. 'Course de food was\r\ncooked on de fireplace, but us had meat and greens but not much\r\nbiscuits. Us had collards an' cabbage, too.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes us would have wild game, 'ca'se de men hunted lots an'\r\nkotched rabbits, 'possums and coons. Dey also kotched a lot of fish.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, our beds warn't so good. Dey was homemade and de sides was\r\nscantlings wid legs nailed on. Den slats was nailed on top of it to put\r\nour shuck-and-straw mattresses on.\r\n\r\n\"My grand-parents was from Virginny. When I was a slave I was used as a\r\nhouse-girl and to help keep de yards clean and bring in water. Us wore\r\nmostly slips, wove in homemade looms; an' dey was osnaburg an' homespun.\r\nWe wore 'em Sunday and Monday de same. Us shoes was made at a tanyard\r\nand dey was brogans as hard as rocks.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members dat some of our white neighbors was poor and didn't have no\r\nslaves. Dey would help us work. De overseer couldn't whip dem, but he\r\nwould make dem work hard and late. I 'members, too, dat de overseer\r\nwaked us up wid a trumpet.\r\n\r\n\"Dey useta tell us dat if us didn't work dey was going to sell us to\r\nhelp feed de rest; and bless yo' soul, us niggers'd go to work, too.\r\nMarster wasn't mean. He would jest lock de slaves in de crib fer\r\npunishment. When slaves was sold, I seed many a nigger put on de block\r\nfor five and six hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Us couldn't leave de plantation widout a pass; and you better not let\r\n'em kotch you wid a book. Us walked to de white church an' set in de\r\nback. Mr. Davey Snell preach and baptize, and dey had foot-washin's.\r\nSometimes de niggers'd git so happy dey would shout. Den dey would keep\r\nshoutin' in de fields next day and git a whipping.\r\n\r\n\"If a nigger got out widout a pass, dey sot de hounds on you; and de\r\npatrollers'd tear you up too, if you stayed out too late.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Carrie Davis, Smith's Station, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Us had sech good times on Sattidy nights; frolic, dance an'\r\ncornshuckin's. Most of 'em would be drinkin' and sing and holler:\r\n\r\n    Sheep's in de cotton patch;\r\n      Got 'im out Monday.\r\n    Had it been a white man;\r\n      Got 'im out Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"Kid Kimbrough was our leader, and he could sing 'Dixie,' too.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas mornin' us'd have a better breakfast and dey would give us\r\nrations at de big house. When any of de slaves got married dey went up\r\nto de white folks' house an' jumped over de broom. Dat was de ceremony\r\nat de weddin'. And if marster wanted to mix his stock of slaves wid a\r\nstrong stock on 'nother plantation, dey would do de mens an' women jest\r\nlak horses. I 'members dat when two niggers married, dey got a big\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\n\"All us chilluns had a big time; played 'Pretty Pauline,' 'Turn,\r\nCharlie,' an' sech-lak.\r\n\r\n\"No'm I never did see nor b'lieve in ghosts.\r\n\r\n\"When us got sick Mistus'd give horse-mint, life-everlasting, goldenrod,\r\nan' holly teas, yessum. And us wore asafetida and pop-ball seed.\r\n\r\n\"When de Yankees come, dey handcuffed our folks and took 'em off.\r\nMarster had his meat, corn, fodder, and sech hauled in de swamp near de\r\nplantation. Dem Yankees went as straight to it as if dey had seed us put\r\nit dere. Dey burned it all up and took some niggers from de other farm.\r\n\r\n\"When freedom come, I 'members dat marster told us dat us was free, but\r\ndat we could stay on if we lacked. Most of us stayed on wid him for a\r\nspell. Now and den de Ku Klux Klan'd come around and beat on a nigger.\r\n\r\n\"I married Charlie Gibson and had two chillun, twelve grand-chilluns and\r\nnine great-grandchilluns.\r\n\r\n\"Honey, I's heard Abraham Lincoln's name, but don't know nothin' 'bout\r\nhim.

I wants my ole cotton\r\nbed an' de moonlight nights a shinin' through de willow trees an' de\r\ncool grass under my feets as I runned aroun' ketchin' lightnin' bugs. I\r\nwants to hear de sound of de hounds in de woods atter de 'possum, an' de\r\nsmell of fresh mowed hay. I wants to feel de sway of de ol' wagon\r\na-goin' down de red, dusty road an' listen to de wheels groanin' as dey\r\nrolls along. I wants to sink my teeth into some of dat good ol' ash\r\ncake, an' smack de good ol' sorghum offen my mouth.

I wants to see de dawn break over de\r\nblack ridge an' de twilight settle over de place spreadin' a sort of\r\norange hue over de place. I wants to walk de paths th'ew de woods an'\r\nsee de rabbits an' watch de birds an' listen to frogs at night. But dey\r\ntuk me away f'om dat a long time ago. 'Twern't long befo' I ma'ied an'\r\nhad chilluns, but don't none of 'em 'tribute to my suppote now.

Prine_\r\n\r\n_ELLA'S WHITE HEN IS HEAPS OF COMPANY_\r\n\r\nElla Dilliard, an old Negro woman who lives at 756 Canal Street, Mobile,\r\nsays she was a small girl during slavery time, and does not know the\r\nhardships of it, because she was owned by good people. Her mother's name\r\nwas Mary Norris, owned by Mrs. Calvin Norris, who lived in Selma, Ala.,\r\nbut had a homestead in Mobile. Her father belonged to people by the name\r\nof Childress, and his name was Green Childress. She doesn't remember\r\nmuch about him because his white people took him to Texas.\r\n\r\nElla said that her mother was her madame's hairdresser, and that Mrs.\r\nNorris had her mother taught in Mobile. So Ella's life was very easy, as\r\nshe stayed around the big house with her mother, although her\r\ngrandmother, Penny Anne Norris, cared for her more than her mother did.\r\nOne of the things she remembers quite distinctly was her grandmother's\r\ncooking on the fireplace, and how she would not allow any one to spit in\r\nthe fireplace. She said her grandmother made corn-pone and wrapped it in\r\nshucks and baked it in ashes.\r\n\r\nElla said she did not know many colored people, since the quarters were\r\nquite a ways from the big house, and that the plantation was managed by\r\nan overseer. She said the quarters were built in rows with streets\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nShe also remembers the first boat she ever saw that was when she was\r\nbrought to Mobile after the surrender, and when she saw the boat she\r\nsaid to her mother: \"Look at that house sitting on the water.\"\r\n\r\nElla said that there were three cooks at the big house, their names\r\nbeing Hannah, Judy, and Charlotte, and the gardener's name was Uncle\r\nJohn. Ella also said that one thing that she remembers so well about the\r\nkitchen in the big house was a large dishpan, that had a partition in\r\nthe middle of it, one side you washed the dishes in, and the other side\r\nwas used for scalding them.\r\n\r\nThe slaves always had Saturdays to wash their clothes and do things for\r\nthemselves. Ella, not having lived among Negroes, does not know much\r\nabout their habits and customs, but she does remember seeing the big\r\nwhite covered wagons that the slaves were carried in to be sold; and\r\nremembers hearing talk of the \"Pattyrollers.\" She said when the slaves\r\nwere sold, they were put on a block, and that the man who were buying\r\nwould look in their mouths just like they did horses.\r\n\r\nElla said she was born in Greensboro, Alabama, but the plantation where\r\nshe later lived was on the Alabama river near Selma, Ala. She doesn't\r\nknow how many acres it comprised, or how many slaves that her master\r\nowned. She remembers her madame made her stop calling her mother\r\n\"mammy,\" and her father \"daddy.\" She said: \"You know, Miss, that the\r\nwhite children now-a-days calls their parents 'mammy and daddy' like the\r\ncolored people used to. The children now do not respect their parents as\r\nthey should, and in fact everything is so different the truth done 'be\r\nunder the table.' You know, miss, I am telling the truth, because the\r\nBible says, 'Woe be unto the one that lies; Judgment is on the land.'\r\n\r\n\"In those days people had to work to live, and they raised most\r\neverything they used, such as cattle, hogs, cotton, and foodstuff. Then\r\nthe women spun the thread out of the cotton, and wove the cloth.\"\r\n\r\nElla helped her grandmother at the weaving by picking up the shuttles\r\nfor her. She said they generally used the cloth as it was woven. The\r\nshoes were made on the place and were called red brogans.\r\n\r\nAs for the churches, the white folks had the brush arbor camp meetings,\r\nwhere the people would go and camp in little cabins for weeks, so they\r\ncould attend the church. They had newspapers then, Ella said, \"but\r\n'course they ain't like you have now, there warn't so many as there is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\"You asked something, miss, about medicines. I don't remember much about\r\nany medicine, because Mr. Calvin Norris was a doctor, and he always\r\ntreated us when we were sick. There was a Dr. Browder who 'tended the\r\nplantation.\"\r\n\r\nElla is a bright colored, small woman, whose eyes are very keen. She\r\nsays that a short time ago she had some trouble with her eyes, and she\r\ngot something from the drug store to bathe them with, but it did not\r\nhelp them. So she caught some pure rain water and \"anointed\" her eyes\r\nwith that, and now she can see to thread a needle. Her life has been\r\nvery colorful in many respects. She recalled as a small child, that,\r\nduring the war, a minie-ball came through a brick wall of the servant\r\nhouse where they were living, but it fell without harming any of the\r\nservants. She said when Wilson's raid was made on Selma, that the Yankee\r\nmen went through the houses just like dogs, taking whatever they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members Mr. Parkman putting two sacks of money down in his big well,\r\nand him getting it out with hooks after the Yankees left.\"\r\n\r\nLater when she was brought to Mobile she worked for Judge Oliver Semmes\r\nfor twenty years. Judge Semmes was the son of Admiral Raphael Semmes,\r\nand she said he was a blessed, good man. For the past fourteen years she\r\nhas been working for the Frank Lyons family of Mobile.\r\n\r\nElla lives in a double tenement house, having one room and a small\r\nkitchen. The room is full of old furniture and odd things. On the mantle\r\nis a lovely old china pitcher that once was owned by Judge Semmes and\r\nwhich Ella prizes very much. The thing that puzzles Ella most among the\r\nmodern inventions, she said, are the aeroplanes, and the way ice is\r\nmade. She said:\r\n\r\n\"Miss, we never had any ice way back yonder. We had nice, old, open\r\nbrick wells, and the water was just like ice. We would draw the water\r\nand put around the milk and butter in the dairy. It's a mystery to me\r\nhow they make that ice, but, my goodness! I guess I need not worry my\r\nhead about things, because I am not here for long. All my family is dead\r\nand gone now, and the only companion I have is this here little white\r\nhen. Her name is Mary. You see, I bought her last year to kill for\r\nChristmas, but I couldn't do it. She is so human; and you ought to see\r\nthe eggs she lays. I even have a few to sell sometimes. I just keeps\r\nMary in the room at night with me, and she is heaps of company for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRufus Dirt\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Rufus Dirt*\r\n    --_Woodrow Hand, Birmingham, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_RUFUS WOULD TALK A LOT FOR A DIME_\r\n\r\nForeword: This Negro, Rufus Dirt, was found on one of Birmingham's\r\nbusiest streets begging for coins. Because of his inability to read, he\r\nwas unable to give the number or location of his home. All he knew was\r\n\"jes' som'ers on Southside, boss.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll drop a dime in your hat uncle if you'll stand here and talk to me\r\nfor a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sho' boss, iffen you wants, I'll talk all day fo' dat much money. I'se\r\nbeen here fo' a long time an' I knows plenty to talk 'bout. What does\r\nyo' want to know?\"\r\n\r\nI explained my interest in slavery days and my search for ex-slaves, but\r\nhe began telling me before I had time to finish. His ability to talk had\r\nsomehow escaped what his age had done to his hair, which was sparse as\r\nwell as snowy white. His eyes were a glazy red. One hand and arm seemed\r\nto be crippled, but the other waved around in the air as he talked and\r\nfinally settled on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Boss, I don' rightly know jes' how old I is. I was a driver (Negro boss\r\nof other slaves) during slavery and I reckons I was about twenty\r\nsompin'. I don' remember nothin' in particular that caused me to get dat\r\ndrivin' job, ceptin' hard work, but I knows dat I was proud of it 'cause\r\nI didn' have to work so hard no mo'. An' den it sorta' made de other\r\nniggers look up to me, an' you knows us niggers, boss. Nothin' makes us\r\nhappier dan' to strut in front of other niggers. Dere ain't nothin' much\r\nto tell about. We jes' moved one crop atter de other till layin' by time\r\ncome and den we'd start in on de winter work. We done jes' 'bout de same\r\nas all de other plantations.\r\n\r\n\"My massa's name was Digby and we live at Tuscaloosa befo' de war. An'\r\n'bout dat war, white folks. Dem was some scary times. De nigger women\r\nwas a-feared to breathe out loud come night an' in de day time, dey\r\ndidn't work much 'cause dey was allus lookin' fo' de Yankees. Dey didn'\r\ncome by so much 'cause atter de first few times. Dere wa'nt no reason to\r\ncome by. Dey had done et up ever'thing and toted off what dey didn' eat.\r\nDey tuk all Massa's stock, burned down de smokehouse atter dey tuk de\r\nmeat out, an' dey burned de barn, an' we'all think ever' time dat dey\r\ngoin' to burn de house down, but dey musta forgot to do dat.\r\n\r\n\"When de war was finally over an' I was free, my family went to\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi where we made a livin' first one way an' den de\r\nother. I don't know how long we stayed dere, but I was livin' in\r\nBummin'ham when dere wa'nt nothin' much here a'tall. I watched all de\r\nbig buildin's 'round here go up and I see'd dem build all de big plants\r\nand I'se still watchin', but I still don' know how to tell folks where\r\nplaces is, 'cause I don' know how to read numbers. I goes anywhere I\r\nwants to go an' I don't ever get lost, but jes' de same, I can't tell\r\nnobody where I am. I don' even know where we is standin' talking like\r\ndis right now. An' boss, I ain't beggin' 'cause I'se too lazy to work.\r\nI'se worked plenty in my time till I crippled dis arm in de mines and\r\nbefo' my eyes got so bad,\" and with a grace and gentleness that may be\r\ncalled a characteristic of his generation, he added, \"I hope I'se told\r\nyou what you wants to know.\"\r\n\r\nHe had. I felt well repaid for the dime I had given him. As he walked\r\noff down the street, I noticed for the first time the large crowd that\r\nhad gathered around us. Evidently slave tales carry more interest than\r\nthis writer realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Eppes\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Katherine Eppes*\r\n    --_Susie R.

My mammy an' pappy was Peter an'\r\nEmma Lines an' us all belonged to Marsa Frank and Miss Sarah Lines. I\r\nwas born on dey plantation five miles below Faunsdale 'bout 1850 so dey\r\ntells me.\r\n\r\n\"I is right ol' but thank Gawd I still got my teefies an' my ha'r lef'.\"\r\nProudly the old woman unwrapped her \"head rag\" to display a thick mop,\r\nwoolly white but neatly parted into squares. Dozens of little plaits,\r\nwrapped with yards of twine, just as her hair had been dressed in the\r\nslave quarters before the War, adorned her head. She sat with uncovered\r\nhead unblinking in the bright June sunshine, as she took up the tale of\r\nher health. \"I sees pretty good, too, but I's so hebby I ain't able to\r\ntoe myse'f 'roun' as pert as I useter.\r\n\r\n\"It was diff'rent back in dem days when I belonged to rich white folks.\r\nDey had plenty of niggers an' dey was log cabins in de quarters jes' as\r\nfar as your eyes could see. Marsa Frank an' Miss Sarah was good to de\r\nblack folks, too. Dey son, young marsa Frank, fit in de big war. Atter\r\nde war was over I stayed on de Lines' place 'twell atter I ma'ied, an'\r\nOl' Miss gin me my weddin' dress an' a long veil down to my foots.\r\n\r\n\"When us was chillun in de quarters we did a mighty lot of playin'.

All of dem called her 'mammy.' Ah 'members one thing jes' lack\r\nit was yestiddy. Miss Sarah went to 'Mospolis (Demopolis) to visit wid\r\nher sister, an' whilst she were gone de oberseer, what go by de name of\r\nAllen, whupped my Mammy crost her back 'twell de blood runned out.\r\n\r\n\"When Miss Sarah comed back an' foun' it out, she was de maddes white\r\nlady I eber seed. She sont for de oberseer, an' she say: 'Allen, what\r\nyou mean by whupping Mammy? You know I don't allow you to tech my house\r\nservants.' She jerk her dress down an' stan' dere lookin' like a sojer\r\nwid her white shoulders shinin' lack a snow bank, an' she say: 'I\r\n'druther see dem marks on my own shoulders dan to see 'em on Mammy's.\r\nDey wouldn't hurt me no wuss.' Den she say: 'Allen, teck your fambly an'\r\ngit offen my place. Don't you let sundown ketch you here. 'So he lef'.\r\nHe wasn't nothin' but white trash nohow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma\" Eppes sat silent for a time as she recalled the vision of Miss\r\nSarah standing straight and regal in her dismissal of the overseer.\r\nFinally she turned with an abrupt change of subject.\r\n\r\n\"Honey, is you a Christian?\" she asked earnestly. \"I hopes you is, ca'se\r\nyou is too fine lookin' for to go to Hell. I b'longs to de Baptis'\r\nChurch, an' dey calls me Ma Eppes 'ca'se I's de mother of de church. I\r\nloves to sing de gospel Hymns.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to sing in a high, cracked voice, her body swaying with the\r\nrhythm. The song rose until her neighbors had gathered to form quite an\r\naudience. With much moaning between every line, she sang:\r\n\r\n    \"I am a sojer of de Cross,\r\n      A follerer of de Lam'.\r\n    I'm not afeard to own His name,\r\n      Nor to 'fen' His cause.\"\r\n\r\n    (Chorus)\r\n\r\n    \"I wan' you to come,\r\n      I wan' you to come,\r\n    I wan' you to come\r\n      An' be saved.\"\r\n\r\nShe was still singing as I left her, the neighbors joining in the\r\nchoruses. Suppers would be late in the row of weatherbeaten cabins,\r\nbecause the spirit of song was on the gathering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReuben Fitzpatrick\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Reuben Fitzpatrick*\r\n    --[HW: _Mabel Farrior, Montgomery, Alabama]_\r\n\r\n_A HORN FOR A HEADACHE_\r\n\r\nReuben Fitzpatrick, of Eugene Street, Montgomery, was born Jan. 9, 1854,\r\n(83 years old).

I was jes' a boy ten years ole an' he\r\nwas a squire dat tried cases, so he rode all over de country to dif'funt\r\nplaces. I rode wid him to hole his horse. He wore a high top black hat\r\nand had a buggy wid a top dat let back. When we went we was gone a long\r\ntime an' when night come he would fix it fer me to sleep wid some uv de\r\nniggers in de quarters where we stopped.

He would hit us wid his cane jes' as if it had been a\r\nswitch. Ben Jones didn't like the way Marse Wash treated us niggers. He\r\nbought us for his son.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't have no doctors much in dem days, but us had a horn us use\r\nwhen we got sick. If us had the headache that horn would go right over\r\nthe spot and it wouldn't be no time 'fore the pain'd be gone. We'd use\r\nthat horn anytime we was ailing an' it'd sho' do the work.

Unlike many of the old Negroes of the South, she has no\r\ngood words for slavery days or the old masters, declaring: \"Dem days was\r\nhell.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat on her front porch and assailed the taking of young children\r\nfrom mothers and selling them in different parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\"I was growed up when de war come,\" she said, \"an' I was a mother befo'\r\nit closed.

I nursed for her, an' one day I was playin'\r\nwid de baby. It hurt its li'l han' an' commenced to cry, an' she whirl\r\non me, pick up a hot iron an' run it all down my arm an' han'. It took\r\noff de flesh when she done it.\r\n\r\n\"Atter awhile, marster married ag'in; but things warn't no better. I\r\nseed his wife blackin' her eyebrows wid smut one day, so I thought I'd\r\nblack mine jes' for fun. I rubbed some smut on my eyebrows an' forgot to\r\nrub it off, an' she kotched me. She was powerful mad an' yelled: 'You\r\nblack devil, I'll show you how to mock your betters.'\r\n\r\n\"Den she pick up a stick of stovewood an' flails it ag'in' my head. I\r\ndidn't know nothin' more 'till I come to, lyin' on de floor.

I was waitin' on de table, an'\r\nhe look up an' see me. I was skeered, an' dat made him awful mad. He\r\ncalled an overseer an' tol' him: 'Take her out an' beat some sense in\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n\"I begin to cry an' run an' run in de night; but finally I run back by\r\nde quarters an' heard mammy callin' me. I went in, an' raght away dey\r\ncome for me. A horse was standin' in front of de house, an' I was took\r\ndat very night to Richmon' an' sold to a speculator ag'in. I never seed\r\nmy mammy any more.\r\n\r\n\"I has thought many times through all dese years how mammy looked dat\r\nnight. She pressed my han' in bofe of hers an' said: 'Be good an' trus'\r\nin de Lawd.'\r\n\r\n\"Trustin' was de only hope of de pore black critters in dem days.

Us\r\ndidn't have no clothes for goin' 'roun. I never had a undershirt until\r\njest befo' my first chil' was borned.

Us was up by three or four in de\r\nmornin' an' everybody got dey somethin' to eat in de kitchen. Dey didn't\r\ngive us no way to cook, nor nothin' to cook in our cabins. Soon as us\r\ndressed us went by de kitchen an' got our piece of cornbread. Dey wasn't\r\neven no salt in dem las' years. Dat piece of cornbread was all us had\r\nfor breakfus', an' for supper, us had de same.\r\n\r\n\"For dinner us had boiled vittles; greens, peas an' sometimes beans.\r\nCoffee? No'm, us never knowed nothin' 'bout coffee.\r\n\r\n\"One mornin' I 'members I had started to de fiel', an' on de way I los'\r\nmy piece of bread. I didn't know what to do.

Time has not softened\r\nher memories. As she told these facts an occasional expression of\r\nbitterness passed over her face.\r\n\r\n\"I's Angie Garrett,\" she said. I was about sixteen years at beginning uv\r\nde Wa'. I was born in De Kalb, Mississippi. My mother was Betty Scott,\r\nan' I didn't know my father's name. I had four brothers, Ember, Johnny,\r\nJimmie, and Henry; and three sisters, Delphie, Lizzie Sue, and Frankie,\r\nand my grandmother was Sukie Scott. She lived five miles from\r\nGainesville across Noxubee Creek (in full, Oka Noxubee) an' I lived wid\r\nher. Never axed 'bout my grand-daddy, 'caze wa'n't no tellin'. My mammy\r\nlived right here in Gainesville an' belong to Mr. Sam Harwood.\r\n\r\n\"I b'longed to de Moorings and Cap'n Mooring run on a boat to Mobile\r\nfrom Aberdeen, Mississippi, 'twus on de 'Bigbee river, an' 'twus called\r\nde _Cremonia_. I was de house gal an' nuss an' I slep' on a pallet in\r\nold Miss's room. I had plenty to eat long as us was on dat boat, and dat\r\nsho' was good. But when us was in De Kalb, vittles was giv' out at de\r\nsmoke house, a slice o' meat and piece of bread and peas, and 'twus\r\nsarnt out ter de fiel'. Mules be eatin' and niggers be eatin'.\r\n\r\n\"I nussed de Moorings little boy Johnny. De little gal had died. Mr.\r\nScott in De Kalb had 'bout fifty slaves and a big plantation and a\r\noverseer name' Barnes. He was a haughty man, and niggers was skeered to\r\ndeath 'caze he would come in a-cussin'.\r\n\r\n\"Us would git up 'fo' daylight. 'Twus dark when go out, dark when come\r\nin. Us make a little fire in de fiel' some mawnin's, hit beeze so cold;\r\ndan us let it go out 'fo' de overseer come. Ef he seed you he'd make yer\r\nlay down flat on yo' belly, foots tied out and han's tied out and whoop\r\nyer wid slapper leather strap wid a handle. But I was laid 'cross a\r\ncheer. I been whooped 'tel I tell lies on myself to make 'em quit. Say\r\ndey whoop 'till I'd tell de troof, so I had ter lie 'bout myse'f keep\r\n'em from killin' me. Dis here race is mo' lac de chillun uv Isreal,\r\n'cept dey didn't have ter shoot no gun ter set um free.\r\n\r\n\"I was sole ter Mr. Johnny Mooring, 'caze de property was in debt. And\r\nden fuss I b'longed ter Mrs. Scott at De Kalb, and her sole me, an' I\r\nsho' was glad. I walked here to Gainesville frum De Kalb, Mississippi.\r\nUs wa'n't 'lowed to learn nothin'. Sometimes us sing and have a little\r\nprayer meetin', but 'twus mighty easy and quiet like. Gran'ma Sukey use'\r\nto sing, \"Travel on, travel on, Soon be Over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef any us died in dem days, buried us quick as dey could and got out of\r\ndere and got to work. At night dey blow'd de horn for 'em to bring in de\r\ncotton w'ut de women spinned. Dey made all de clof. Us worked nights\r\ntoo, but us rested Sundays. Us didn't git no presents at Christmas.\r\nSometimes us had a corn shuckin', and no celebration for no marriage.\r\nDat was called \"jumpin' de broom,\" jes' taken up wid 'em. Dey all want\r\nyou to have plenty of chillun, though.\r\n\r\n\"Us wo' asafetida 'roun' us neck keep off de small pox and measles. Us\r\ndidn't have much medicine and some of um was always full of bad\r\ncomplaints lac' Carrie, my neighbor, whut you axed about. I bees\r\na-hurtin', but I can't never git in edgeways for her. Always got a lot\r\nexcuses; doan' never 'spects to die 'thout folks knows whut ails her.\r\nBut she brought me some black-eyed peas today, and I lac's um 'caze dey\r\nbiles sof', and I say 'ef de devil brought hit, God sarnt hit.'\r\nSometimes I bees hongry, an' I say, 'Whut is I'm gwinter eat?', and\r\nalong come somebody wid sumpin'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Angie Garrett, Livingston, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Wish you could of heered dat calliope on de _Cremonia_.

But de good Lord he'ps me. He hol's my han'. I ain't got\r\nnothin' 'gin nobody. I doan' see no need of fussin' and fightin' an'\r\na-drinkin' whiskey.

Den he gives me a old\r\ndirty dime, but now wid dese here tokens, you gotter pay some of hit fer\r\nspendin'. Dey tells me hit's de Governor, and I say 'let him carry 'em;\r\nhe kin tote 'em, I ain't able.' Well, once ain't always, and twice ain't\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I doan' never go ter church no mo'. De preachers here is goin'\r\nbline about money. Dey ain't interested in dey soul. Some folks b'longs\r\nter de church an' ain't been changed. De church ain't all of hit. I\r\n'members day uv 'manicpation.

But he\r\ngot in debt and he sole his five boys. Dey was his own chillun, and he\r\ncould sell 'em under de law. De names was Eber, Eli, Ezekiel, Enoch, and\r\nEzra, an' he sole 'em ter de highes' bidder right yonder 'front of de\r\nPos' Office for cash. And Jack Tom was another free nigger here and he\r\nbought some of 'em, and dey others de white folks bought, and I never\r\nheerd no complaint and I seed 'em long as dey lived. Dey was a heap of\r\nthings went on. Some I lac's to remember, some I doan'. But I'd rather\r\nbe free now. I never seed Mr. Lincoln, but when dey tole me 'bout him, I\r\nthought he was partly God.\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. John Rogers right here, (he's dead an' gone now), he was whut\r\nhe was and wasn't 'ceitful. Go to him ef you got into anything, and he\r\nmore'n apt to tell you whut to do. He was wile when he was young, but he\r\nsettle down and was de bes' white man to de niggers I ever know'd.

His\r\nface bore the expression worn only by those of his race who had lived\r\nand toiled in a much earlier and in many instances, happier day.

Prine, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_A SLAVE BOY ESCAPES WHIPPING BY PULLING TAIL OF FROCK COAT_\r\n\r\nA low, stout, sleek headed Negro man, sat in an old rocking chair in an\r\nend room of a long row of rooms of a tenement house at 708 South\r\nHamilton Street, Mobile, Alabama. This old darkey said, when asked by\r\nthe writer if he lived during slavery times: \"I not only lived durin'\r\nslavery times, but I was here before a gun was fired, an' b'fore Lincoln\r\nwas elected. I tells you, Miss, de fust time I 'members anything--a tale\r\nof any kind. I was livin' in Vicksburg, Lee County, Mississippi, an' mah\r\nmaw an' paw's names was Amelia Williams an' Hiram Gill. I couldn't tells\r\nyou whar dey war from, dough. But I does know dat Mista Arthur an'\r\nGeorge Foster owned us, up 'til I war a big boy. De way it was, dere\r\nmother, Ol' Missy, was a widow, an' her had dese two boys, an' she had\r\nmoney, I tells you she had barrels ob money; so when de two boys got old\r\nenough she divide de slaves, an' property 'tween 'em. Me an' mah maw\r\nfell to Arthur Foster, and sum ob our kindred fell to George Foster.\r\nMister George was a Captain in de army an' was killed near Vicksburg.\r\n\r\n\"De Ol' Missy's place shore was big, I couldn't say how many acres dere\r\nwas, but hit run four or five miles, an' she owned hundreds ob slaves.\r\nShe had lots ob log cabin quarters, whut had de cracks daubed wid mud,\r\nan' den ceiled wid boards. I'se tellin' you dey was twice as warm as de\r\nhouses we lib in now. Dey had chimbleys built ob mud an' sticks, an' had\r\nbig wide, fireplaces, dat we cooked on, an' de beds was homemade, but\r\nLor' dey was heaps stronger dan dey is now, in dese times. Dem beds was\r\nmorticed together.\r\n\r\n\"As I said b'fore I was a boy between fourteen or fifteen years old\r\nb'fore de slaves was divided, an' when I was on de Ol' Missy's place, I\r\nstayed aroun' de house, an' wait on dem, an' 'tend de horses. Anudder\r\nthing I had to do, dey would send me for the mail. I had to go twelve\r\nmiles atter hit an' I couldn't read or write, but I could bring\r\neverybody's mail to dem jes' right. I knowed I had better git hit right.\r\nYou see I could kinder figure, so I could make out by de numbers.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Missy an' Mister Arthur both was good to me an' all de slaves, dey\r\n'low de slaves to make dere own patch ob cotton, an' raise chickens, an'\r\nhe would sell hit for dem. Cotton was de main crop, in dem days, hit\r\nwould sell as high as twenty-five cents a pound. 'Course dey raises\r\ncorn, pears, an' other things on de plantation, too, but dey made de\r\ncotton. Master Jesus! dey sumtimes made from fifty to one hundred an'\r\nfifty bales.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members how all de women had looms, both black and white, weavin'\r\ncloth for de clothes; an' den dey raised sheep to git de wool to make\r\ndem gray uniforms. Lord, at sheep shearing time! hit was big times. Let\r\nme tell you, Miss, dem uniforms was made out ob all wool, too, but I\r\ncain't 'member whut dey used to dye 'em gray, but I 'members dey dyed\r\nwid red oak bark, walnut bark, an' also a brush whut growed down on the\r\nbranch, also dey used de laurel leaves to dye yellow, as well as clay.\r\nDey so't de dye wid salt, an' hit really stayed in.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you, dey really fed us slaves good, up 'til such a length\r\no' time atter de war broke out, den food began to git scarce.\r\n\r\n\"You see de Government taxed 'em, an' dey had to gib so much to feed de\r\nsoldiers. Even den us had a good time, I 'members how de li'l chillun\r\nplayed ball, and marbles, 'specially marbles, hit was our big game. Even\r\natter night dey had a big light out in de backyard, an' us would play.\r\nSometimes us would hunt at night, and well I 'members one Sat'day night\r\nI went huntin' wid mah uncle, an' didn't git in 'til daylight nex'\r\nmawning, an' I was sleepy an' didn't git de shoes all cleaned before\r\nchurch time. So ol' Marsar called me an' tuk me to de carriage house to\r\ngib me a whippin'. Ol' Marser's boy was about de same age as me an' he\r\nbeg his paw not to whip me, an' I was beggin', too, but he carried me\r\non, an' when we got in de carriage house, Ol' Marser had to climb up on\r\nde side wall to git de whip, an' he had on one ob dos long tailed coats,\r\nan' hit left dem tails hangin' down, so I jes' grabbed hold ob dem, an'\r\nmade him fall, an' den I run to de Ol' Missy's room, 'ca'se I knowed\r\nwhen I got in dere, dat Ol' Marser would neber hit me.\r\n\r\n\"De Ol' Missy got up out ob de bed an' wouldn't let Ol' Marster whip me,\r\nan' she got so mad dat she tol' him dat she warn't going to church wid\r\nhim dat morning, an' dat lack to kill de Ol' Marster, 'ca'se he shore\r\nloved an' was proud ob Ol' Missy. She was a beautiful woman. Dat ended\r\nde whippin', an' dat's de only time I 'members him tryin' to whip me.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Missy didn't 'low dem to whip de women either, an' dey wouldn't\r\n'low de women to roll logs either. But dey did work dem in de fiel's.\r\n'Course dey kept de young women wid babies 'roun' de house, an' dey eat\r\nde same grub as de white folks eat.\r\n\r\n\"Talking 'bout log rollin', dem was great times, 'ca'se if some ob de\r\nneighborin' plantations wanted to get up a house, dey would invite all\r\nde slaves, men and women, to come wid dere masters. De women would help\r\nwid de cookin' an' you may be shore dey had something to cook. Dey would\r\nkill a cow, or three or four hogs, and den hab peas, cabbage, an'\r\neverything lack grows on de farm. An' if dere was any meat or food lef'\r\ndey would gib dat to de slaves to take home, an' jes' b'fore dark de\r\no'seer or Ol' Marster would gib de slaves all de whiskey dey wanted to\r\ndrink. Sometimes atter de days work, dey would hab a frolic, such as\r\ndancin', an' ol' time games.\r\n\r\n\"Dey would hab dese same kind ob gatherin's at cornshucking time, an'\r\ncotton pickin' time, but dere warn't so much foolishness at cotton\r\npickin' time, 'ca'se dey didn't call one anudder den, 'ceptin' when de\r\ncotton got so far ahead ob dem, an' was 'bout to set in fer a wet spell,\r\nor rainy season.\r\n\r\n\"You axed me 'bout de patty-rollers? You see de City policemen walkin'\r\nhis beat? Well, dat's de way de patty-rollin' was, only each county had\r\ndere patty-rollers, an' dey had to serve three months at a time, den dey\r\nwas turned loose. And if dey cotch you out widout a pass, dey would gib\r\nyou thirty-nine lashes, 'ca'se dat was de law. De patty-rollers knowed\r\nnearly all de slaves, an' it wurn't very often dey ever beat 'em.\r\n\r\n\"You know folks was jes' de same den as dey is now, both black, and\r\nwhite. Some folks you could neighbor wid den, jes' lack you can now, an'\r\ndere was good folks den, jes' de same as dey is now.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas time was de bes' ob all, 'ca'se us allus had a big dinner,\r\nan' de Ol' Marster gib de women calico dresses an' shoes, an' de men\r\nshoes an' hats, an' would gib us flour, an' sugar, molasses, an' would\r\nbuy beer, whiskey an' wine.\r\n\r\n\"De Ol' Marster tuk good keer ob us too, when any ob us got sick he send\r\nfor de doctor, den when dey order de medicine to be giben at night, he'd\r\nsee dat us got hit. But nowadays if you git sick, you hab to git de\r\nDoctor, an' den pay him yo' se'f. Den de Ol' Marster had to find clothes\r\nan' shoes for us, but now us has to scuffle an' git dem de bes' way us\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Miss, I'se been here a long time, I eben 'members Jefferson\r\nDavis. I'se seen him many a time. He had a home 'tween here (Mobile) an'\r\nNew Orleans, an' you knows he fust tuk his seat in Montgomery, an' den\r\nmoved to Richmond, Virginny.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members, too, how I useta to think dat de Baptist was de only\r\nreligion. You see John de Baptist come here baptizing, an' ever'body had\r\nto offer up sacrifices, a goat or a sheep or sumpin', jes' lack de man\r\nwho was going to offer up his son for a sacrifice. But you knows, Jesus\r\ncome an' changed all dat. De folks in dem times didn't hab nobody to\r\nworship; an' den one come, who said, 'Father, hand me a body, and I'll\r\ndie for dem,' Dat's Christ, an' he was baptized, an' God gib Jesus dis\r\nwhole world. So I believed, dat was de only religion.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members how us would hab big baptizings an' shout. Us allus went to\r\nchurch in de white folks church, dey had church in de mornings, us had\r\nours in de afternoons. Us would hab to hab a pass, dough, 'ca'se de\r\nchurch was eight miles away from de plantation.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was plenty old songs us useta to sing, but I can't 'member 'em.\r\nDere is dis one dat goes--\r\n\r\n    Wonderful Peter,\r\n    Wonderful Paul,\r\n    Wonderful Silas,\r\n    Who for to make a\r\n    Mah heart rejoice.\r\n\r\n    On Good Shepherds, feed a' mah sheep.\r\n    Don't you hear de young lambs a bleatin'?\r\n    Don't you hear de young lambs a bleatin'?\r\n    Don't you hear de young lambs a bleatin'?\r\n    Oh! Good shepherds feed a' mah sheep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJim Gillard\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Jim Gillard*\r\n    --_Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_SOLD AT THREE MONTHS FOR $350_\r\n\r\nJim Gillard was eleven years old when the War between the States began.\r\nThus, the memories of the conflict are fresh; with the retreat from\r\nRome, Ga., to Salem, Ala., as a refugee, transcending the others.\r\n\r\nJim was born on a plantation at Pendleton, S.C., and was sold for $350\r\nwhen he was only three months old.

No'm, he war'nt no overseer,\r\nbut Ol' Marster allus had confidence in him.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members dat when dey would be a funeral, us'd sing; marchin' befo'\r\nde body 'fore us'd get to de grave an' singin', 'Hark come de tune a\r\ndoleful sound, my years a tender cry; a livin' man come view de ground\r\nwhar you may shortly lie.'\r\n\r\n\"Us frolics on Sattidy night was fine an' us'd dance 'twel mos' day.\r\nMarster's brother would fiddle for us, an' at Christmas time us would\r\nhave six days to frolic. Us also had a big time at de cornshuckin's, an'\r\nus'd whoop an' holler an' sing mos' all night. De big niggers had plenty\r\nof liquor de boss give 'um.

It was cornbread 'twell on Sundays den us'd git\r\nfo' biscuits apiece. Us got fatback mos' ever' mornin'. Sometimes us\r\nmought git a chicken for dinner on a Sunday or some day lack Chris'mas.\r\nIt was mighty seldom us gits anythin' lack dat, dough. We lacked possums\r\nan' rabbits but dey didn' come twell Winter time when some of de men\r\nfolks'd run 'crost one in de fiel'. Dey never had no chanst to git out\r\nan' hunt none.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was no sech thang as havin' diffe'nt clo's for winter an' Summer.\r\nUs wore de same thang in summertime as in de wintertime. De same was\r\ntrue 'bout shoes. Us wore brogans from one yeah to de yuther.\r\n\r\n\"My Ol' Massa was a putty good man but nothin' exter. One thang 'bout\r\nhim, he wouldn' 'low none of de oberseers to whup none of us, lessen he\r\nwas dar to see hit done. Good thang he was lack dat, too, 'caze he sabed\r\nde blacks a many a lick what dey'd got iffen he hadn' been dar. Massa\r\nJim was a bach'lor, an' he ain't never had much truck wid women folks.\r\nIffen he had any chilluns, I never knowed nothin' 'bout 'em.\r\n\r\n\"De oberseers was terrible hard on us. Dey'd ride up an' down de fiel'\r\nan' haste you so twell you near 'bout fell out. Sometimes an' most\r\ninginer'ly ever' time you 'hin' de crowd you got a good lickin' wid de\r\nbull whup dat de driver had in de saddle wid him. I hearn mammy say dat\r\none day dey whupped po' Leah twell she fall out like she was daid. Den\r\ndey rubbed salt an' pepper on de blisters to make 'em burn real good.\r\nShe was so so' 'twell she couldn' lay on her back nights, an' she jes'\r\ncouldn' stan' for no clo's to tech back whatsomever.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Jim had 'bout one of de bigges' plantations in dat section. I\r\nguess he had nigh onto a hun'erd blacks on de place. I never knowed\r\n'zackly how many thar was nor how big de place was.\r\n\r\n\"De folks now'days is allus complainin' 'bout how dey is havin' sech\r\nhard times, but dey jes' don' know nothin'. Dey should hab come up when\r\nI did an' dey'd see now dey is libin' jes' lack kings an' queens. Dey\r\ndon' have to git up 'fo' day when hit's so dark you kin jes' see your\r\nhan's 'fo' your eyes. Dey don' know what it's lack to have to keep up\r\nwid de leader. You know dey was allus somebody what could wuk faster dan\r\nde res' of de folks an' dis fellow was allus de leader, an' ever'body\r\nelse was s'pose to keep up wid him or her whatsomever hit was. Iffen you\r\ndidn' keep up wid de leader you got a good thrashin' when you gits home\r\nat night. Hit was allus good dark when de han's got in from de fiel'.\r\nCo'se iffen dar was a lady what had a baby at home, she could leave jes'\r\na little 'fo' de sun sot.\r\n\r\n\"Younguns now'days don' know what it is to be punish'; dey thank iffen\r\ndey gits a li'l whuppin' from dey mammy now dat dey is punish' terrible.\r\nDey should of had to follow de leader for one day an' see how dey'd be\r\npunish' iffen dey gits too far behin'. De bigges' thang dat us was\r\npunish' for was not keepin' up. Dey'd whup us iffen we was caught\r\ntalkin' 'bout de free states, too. Iffen you wan't whupped, you was put\r\nin de 'nigger box' an' fed cornbread what was made widouten salt an' wid\r\nplain water. De box was jes' big 'nough for you to stan' up in, but hit\r\nhad air holes in hit to keep you from suffocatin'. Dere was plenty\r\nturnin' 'roun' room in hit to 'low you to change your position ever'\r\noncet in a while. Iffen you had done a bigger 'nough thang you was kep'\r\nin de 'nigger box' for months at de time, an' when you got out you was\r\nnothin' but skin an' bones an' scurcely able to walk.\r\n\r\n\"Half de time a slave didn' know dat he was sol' 'twell de massa'd call\r\nhim to de Big House an' tell him he had a new massa from den on. Ever'\r\ntime dat one was sol' de res' of 'em'd say, 'I hopes nex' time'll be\r\nme.' Dey thought you'd git a chanst to run away to de free states. I\r\nhearn my mammy say dat when she come from Virginny dat she come on a\r\nboat built outten logs. She say she never was so sick in all her life. I\r\nseed a 'hole wagon load of slaves come through our farm one day what was\r\non dere way to Arkansas. Dey was de mos' I ever seed travel at de same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"De white folks didn't 'low us to even look at a book. Dey would scol'\r\nan' sometimes whup us iffen dey caught us wid our head in a book. Dat is\r\none thang I sho'ly did want to do an' dat was to learn to read an'\r\nwrite. Massa Jim promised to teach us to read an' write, but he neber\r\nhad de time.\r\n\r\n\"Dere wan't but one chu'ch on de place what I lived on, an' de colored\r\nand de white both went to hit. You know we was neber 'lowed to go to\r\nchu'ch widoutten some of de white folks wid us. We wan't even 'lowed to\r\ntalk wid nobody from anudder farm. Iffen you did, you got one of de wus'\r\nwhuppin's of your life. Atter freedom Massa Jim tol' us dat dey was\r\n'fraid we'd git together an' try to run away to de No'th, an' dat was\r\nw'y dey didn' wan' us gittin' together talkin'.\r\n\r\n\"A few years 'fo' de war my pappy learnt to read de Bible. (Mary Ella\r\napparently forgot her previous comment on penalties for learning to\r\nread). Whenever we would go to chu'ch he would read to us an' we'd sing.\r\n'Bout de mos' two pop'lar songs dey sung was 'Steal Away' an' 'I Wonder\r\nWhar Good Ol' Dan'el Was.' 'Steal Away' is sech a pop'lar song what\r\never'body knows hit. De yuther one is done mought' nigh played out, so\r\nI'll sing hit for you. It goes lack dis:\r\n\r\n    I wonder whar was good ol' Dan'el,\r\n      I wonder whar was good ol' Dan'el,\r\n    I wonder whar was thankin' (thinking) Peter,\r\n      I wonder whar was thankin' Peter.\r\n\r\n    (Chorus)\r\n\r\n    I'm goin' away, goin' away.\r\n      I'm goin' away, goin' away.\r\n\r\n    I wonder whar was weepin' Mary,\r\n      I wonder whar was weepin' Mary,\r\n    I'm goin' away, I'm goin' away,\r\n      I'm goin' away to live forever,\r\n    I'll never turn back no mo'.\r\n\r\n\"De slaves would git tired of de way dey was treated an' try to run away\r\nto de No'th. I had a cousin to run away one time. Him an' anudder fellow\r\nhad got 'way up in Virginny 'fo' Massa Jim foun' out whar dey was. Soon\r\nas Massa Jim foun' de whar'bouts of George he went atter him. When Massa\r\nJim gits to George an' 'em, George pertended lack he didn' know Massa\r\nJim. Massa Jim as' him, \"George don't you know me?' George he say, 'I\r\nneber seed you 'fo' in my life.' Den dey as' George an' 'em whar did dey\r\ncome from. George an' dis yuther fellow look up in de sky an' say, 'I\r\ncome from above, whar all is love.' Iffen dey had owned dey knowed Massa\r\nJim he could have brung 'em back home. My pappy tried to git away de\r\nsame time as George an' dem did, but he couldn' see how to take all us\r\nchillun wid him, so he had to stay wid us. De blacks an' de whites would\r\nhave de terr'bles' battles sometimes. Dat would be when de blacks would\r\nslip off to de No'th an' was caught an' brung back. De paterollers'd\r\nketch de colored folks an' lock 'em up twell de owner came atter 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Iffen a slave was cotched out after nine o'clock he was whupped. Dey\r\ndidn' 'low nobody out atter it was dark 'lessen he had a pass from de\r\nMassa. One night, 'fo' George an' dis fellow (I disremembers his name,\r\nbut I thinks it was Ezra) runned away, George tried to git over to de\r\nbunk whar he lived an' one of de oberseers seen him an' dey put him in\r\nde 'nigger box' for three weeks. Jes' as soon as he got out again,\r\nGeorge an' dis Ezra slipped off. Dey had a sign dat dey would give each\r\nyuther eve'y night atter sundown. George would hang de lantern in de\r\nwindow, an' den he would take it outen de window an' hang it raght back\r\nin dar ag'in. I couldn't never make no sense outen it. I axed him one\r\nday whut he was adoin' dat for. He say dat 'fo' long I'd know 'zackly\r\nwhat is all about. Dis was de sign of how long dey have to wait 'fo' dey\r\ntry to git away.\r\n\r\n\"Atter de day's work was over, de slaves didn't have nothin' to do but\r\ngo to bed. In fac', dey didn't feel lack doin' nothin' else. On Satiday\r\ndey sot up an' washed so's dey could have some clean clothes to wear de\r\ncomin' week. We wukked all day, ever' day 'cep'n some Sat'days, we had a\r\nhalf day off den. Us didn' git many an' on'y when us as' for 'em. On\r\nSundays us jes' laid 'roun' 'mos' all day. Us didn't git no pleasure\r\noutten goin' to church, 'caze we warn't 'lowed to say nothin'. Sometimes\r\neven on Chris'mas us didn't git no res'. I 'members on one Chris'mas us\r\nhad to build a lime kiln. When us git a holiday us rested. Iffen dere\r\nwas a weddin' or a funeral on our plantation us went. Odderways we don't\r\ngo nowhar.\r\n\r\n\"De war come when I was a big gal. I 'member dat my uncle an' cousin\r\njined in wid de Yankees to hope fight for de freedom. De Yankees come to\r\nour place an' runned Massa Jim away an' tuk de house for a horsepittil.\r\nDey tuk all of Massa Jim's clothes an' gived dem to some of dere\r\nfrien's. Dey burned up all de cotton, hay, peas an' ever'thing dat was\r\nin de barns. Dey made de white folks cook for de colored an' den serve\r\n'em while dey et. De Yankees made 'em do for us lak we done for dem. Dey\r\nshowed de white folks what it was to work for somebody else. Dey stayed\r\non our place for de longes'. When dey did leave, dere warn't a mouthful\r\nto eat in de house. When de war was over, Massa Jim told us dat we had\r\nto find som'ers else to live. Co'se some of my folks had already gone\r\nwhen he come home. Us lef' Massa Jim's an' moved to anudder farm. We got\r\npay for de wuk what we did on dis yuther place. Raght atter de war de Ku\r\nKlux got atter de colored folks. Dey would come to our houses an' scare\r\nus mos' to death. Dey would take some of de niggers out an' whup 'em an'\r\ndose dat dey didn't whup dey tied up by dere fingers an' toes. Dese Ku\r\nKlux would come to our windows at night an' say: 'Your time ain't long\r\nacomin'.' De Ku Klux got so bad dat dey would even git us in de daytime.\r\nDey tuk some of de niggers an' throwed 'em in de river to drown. Dey\r\nkep' dis up 'twell some folks from de North come down an' put a stop to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"I ma'ied Nelson Granberry. De weddin' was private. I don't have no\r\nchilluns, but my husban' got fo'. I haven't heered from any of 'em in a\r\nlong time now. I guess dey all daid.\r\n\r\n\"Abe Lincoln was de bes' president dat dis country eber had. Iffen it\r\nhadn't been for him we'd still be slaves raght now. I don't think so\r\nmuch of Jeff Davis 'caze he tried to keep us slaves. Booker T.\r\nWashington was one of de greates' niggers dat ever lived, he always\r\ntried to raise de standard of de race.\r\n\r\n\"I joined the church 'caze de Bible says dat all people should join de\r\nchurch an' be Christians. Jesus Christ set up de church an' said dat\r\never'body what wanted to be saved to come unto him. Sin is de cause of\r\nde world bein' in de fix dat it's in today. De only way to fight sin is\r\nto git together. Iffen we can do away wid sin raght now, de world would\r\nbe a paradise. In de church we learn de will of God an' what he would\r\nhave us do.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was no po' white trash in our 'munity; dey was kep' back in de\r\nmountains.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEsther Green\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Esther Green*\r\n    --_Ila B. Prine_\r\n\r\n_US CHILLUN WORE SHOES LIKE GROWNUPS_\r\n\r\n'Aunt' Esther Green, of 554 Texas Street, Mobile, Alabama, was all too\r\nready to talk about her slavery days in spite of her assertion that she\r\ndidn't remember much about the war.\r\n\r\n\"I was jus' a chile,\" she says. \"You can figure for yourself. Somebody\r\ntole me I was born in 1855, so I couldn't of been very old. I was born\r\nin State Line, Mississippi, and was owned by Edward Davis. He owned my\r\nmother, Rachel Davis and her mother, Melinda Davis. I never did know who\r\nmy pappy was 'cause I never did see him.\r\n\r\n\"To de bes' of my recollections, my whitefolks was allus good to us\r\nniggers. He neber allowed no overseers and he never whipped none of dem,\r\n'ceptin' maybe a switching once in a while for us littl'luns when we\r\ndidn't behave. I never saw a growed up nigger whipped in all my life.\r\nOle Massa jus' didn't b'lieve in dat. Massa was shorely a good man. Lots\r\nof times he would get us little niggers up on de porch at de big house\r\nand have us dance for him. We sho used to have a big time out on dem big\r\nwhite porches.\r\n\r\n\"I never had no work to do myself, 'cause I always stayed in de big\r\nhouse wid Miss Mary Davis, ole Massa's wife. I was in de house one day\r\nand ole Massa asked me if I wanted to eat at de table wid dem, so I\r\npulled up a chair and spite of de fact dere was all kinds of good stuff\r\nto eat in front of me, I called for lye hominy. I sho did love dat stuff\r\nbetter'n anything else I ever et. Ole Massa and de res' of dem jus'\r\nlaugh fit to kill. I reckon dey thought I was crazy sho' nuff', but I et\r\nhominy jes' de same.\r\n\r\n\"As to de number of slaves ole Massa had, I never knew. Us had log\r\ncabins to stay in. De cracks was chinked up wid yellow mud to keep de\r\ncold out and de chim'ney was made of straw and de same kind of mud, but\r\ndem cabins was warmer dan de house is nowadays. We didn't have no\r\nfurniture 'ceptin' a home-made bed which was nailed to de wall on one\r\nside and two legs out in de middle of de floor. De mattresses was made\r\nof straw and hay. All de cookin' was done on de big open fireplaces what\r\nhad big potracks to hang de pots on.\r\n\r\n\"Massa rationed out de food every week and we usually got a peck of\r\nmeal. We had plenty of 'taters and peas and other vegetables dat we\r\ngrowed on de place. At Chris'mas time, we was give meat and molasses to\r\nmake cakes. Us always had plenty of plain food. And too, de men would go\r\nhuntin' at night and come back wid lots of big fat 'possums and rabbits\r\nby de dozen, and mos' of de time, dey would even catch a coon. And old\r\nBen, a nigger who had turkey traps, was always bringin' in lots of dem\r\nbig fat birds.\r\n\r\n\"De men and women worked in de field all day, but I never picked a bit\r\nof cotton all my life. At night de women would spin and weave cloth, but\r\nI never did learn to do dat. Den dey would dye de cloth different\r\ncolors, mostly red and blue though, and make dem into clothes. Us\r\nchilluns had a one-piece dress or slip. Our shoes was all homemade too.\r\nMassa had one man who tanned de leather. He would take it an put it into\r\na long trough for a long time and den whatever was done dat was supposed\r\nto be done to it, he would take it out and cut it and make shoes. Us\r\nchilluns' had shoes same as de grown folks.\r\n\r\n\"On Sundays, we would got to de white folks' church. Dere was a shed\r\nbuilt onto de church and we would sit on benches out under de shed and\r\nlisten to de preacher. De white folks would have lots of big baptizings,\r\nbut I never did see no niggers baptized den.\r\n\r\n\"Ole Massa had a big fambly, three boys and six girls. My own ma had\r\neight chilluns. Us was always healthy and never had to have much\r\nmedicine. 'Bout de only thing I remembers ever takin' was tea made from\r\nde root of de china berry tree. It made good tea for worms, but was to\r\nbe used only at certain times of de moon. My man also used Jerusalem Oak\r\nseed for worms. I never fools wid tryin' to doctor nobody's chilluns\r\nnow-a-days, things is all so different.\r\n\r\n\"My Grandma, Melinda, and ole Ben and his wife was three ole people\r\nMassa freed long time before de war. When all de niggers was freed,\r\nMassa called em up to de house and tole dem dat dey was loose to go\r\nwherever suited dem, but mos' of dem stayed on de place two or three\r\nweeks, and den one mornin' I woke up and all of dem had left durin' de\r\nnight. I was de only nigger left on de place and I jus' cried and cried,\r\nmostly because I was jus' lonesome for some of my own kind to laugh and\r\ntalk wid.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember exactly what I did after de Surrender, but it was\r\nabout four years afterwards dat I come to Mobile and I been here every\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nI's a member of de Mobile Delaware Baptist Church, but I can't attend\r\nvery regular 'count of bein' all crippled up wid de rheumatisms. I\r\nreckon dat ailing is natural though, cause I been here a long time and\r\nI's got forty grandchilluns and more dan dat many great-grandchilluns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJake Green\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Jake Green*\r\n    --_Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_A CONJU' WHAT DIDN' WUK_\r\n\r\n\"Yessum, dem niggers sho' was scared when ole Buck showed up in de\r\nfiel',\" Jake Green, former slave, laughed with a vigor that denied his\r\neighty-five years as he described \"a conju' what didn' wuk.\" Jake has a\r\nvivid memory of those days before the Civil War, though he was only a\r\nsmall boy when it started.\r\n\r\n\"Me an' my mother an' father b'longed to old man Lam Whitehead jes' a\r\nfew miles from Coatopa, 'bout ten miles east of Livingston, Alabama,\" he\r\nbegan. \"My mother was Molly Whitehead, my father was Dan Whitehead. I\r\ndon't know nothin' 'bout my gran'mammy an' gran'pappy, but I had a heap\r\nof unkies.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Whitehead owned Dirtin Ferry down to Belmont, an' dey had a darkey\r\ndere named Dick what claim sick all de time. So de Massa man said,\r\n'Dick, dam it, go to de house. I can't get no work outten you.' So Dick\r\nwent on. He was a fiddler so dey jes' tuck his vittuls to him for seven\r\nyears. Den one day, Old Massa say to de overseer man, 'Let's slip up\r\ndere an' see what Dick doin'. So dey did, an' dere sot Dick, fat as he\r\ncould be a-playin' de fiddle an' a-singin',\r\n\r\n    'Fool my Massa seben years.\r\n    Gwiner fool him seben mo'.\r\n    Hey diddle, de diddle, de diddle, de do'.'\r\n\r\n\"'Bout dat time Ole Massa poked his head in de do' said 'Dam iffen you\r\nwill. Come outten dere, you black rascal, an' go to work, 'An' I ain't\r\nnever hyard of Dick complainin' no mo'.\r\n\r\n\"But dey wan't so mean. Sometimes us got whupped but Massa had fo' men\r\nhe didn't 'low nobody to hit, white er black. Dey was Unker Arch, he was\r\nde main carriage driver; my father, he was de house servant; Unker\r\nJulius, de fo'man of de plow han's an' Unker Ed'erds, de fo'man of de\r\nhoe han's. Whenever anybody wanted to hire anybody to work for 'em, de\r\nMassa send dem fo' out an' hire 'em by de day to chop cotton or pick.\r\nAn' dem fo' niggers could chop much cotton in a day as de mule could\r\nplow. Whenever dey'd stop de plow at twelve o'clock, dem niggers was\r\nright dere to lay de hoe handles on de plow, an' dat's choppin'. All\r\nfour could pick a bale of cotton a day. Whenever anybody say, 'Mr.\r\nWhitehead, I want a bale of cotton picked today,' he'd send dem fo' men\r\nan' dey could pick five hundred pounds apiece an' leave de sun still\r\nrunnin'. Dey was pickers in dem days!\r\n\r\n\"Cose dey had to begin, an' all us got up 'fo' day. Twan't nothin'\r\nstrange to be standin' in de fiel' by your plow waitin' for de sun to\r\ncome up. Ev'body was early risers in dem days. Dey was pretty good to\r\nus, but ole Mr. Buck Brasefiel', what had a plantation 'jinin' us'n, was\r\nso mean to his'n dat twan't nothin' for 'em to run away. One nigger,\r\nRich Parker, runned off one time an' whilst he gone he seed a hoodoo\r\nman, so when he got back Mr. Brasefiel' tuck sick an' stayed sick two or\r\nthree weeks. Some of de darkies tole him, 'Rich been to de hoodoo\r\ndoctor.' So Mr. Brasefiel' got up outten dat bed an' come a-yellin' in\r\nde fiel', 'You thought you had ole Buck, but by God he rose agin'. Dem\r\nniggers was so skeered, dey squatted in de fiel' jes' lack partridges,\r\nan' some of 'em whispered, 'I wish to God he had a-died.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Jake Green, Livingston, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"'Twan't long atter dat come S'render, but dat nigger done lef' dere,\r\nan' didn't nobody know whar Parker was at. Some of de niggers done\r\nbought an' paid for dey mule an' me an' Pappy was rentin' an' wukkin' on\r\nsneers, when here come Parker, jes' hyared 'bout S'render. He say 'Why\r\ndidn't somebody come tell me 'twas S'render?' Den he start a-singin'\r\n\r\n    Slav'y chain, slav'y chain,\r\n    Thank God a'mighty I'm free at las',\r\n    Free at las', free at las',\r\n    Thank God a'mighty I'm free at las'.\r\n\r\n\"But dat wan't none of Old Massa's niggers. He had one, do' call him\r\nJohn, an' hit come a traveler an' stayed all night. Ole Massa p'inted\r\nout John, an' said, 'He ain't never tole me a lie in his life.' De\r\ntraveler bet Massa a hund'ed dollars 'ginst fo' bits he'd ketch John in\r\na lie 'fo' he lef'. Next mawnin' at de table de mice was pretty bad, so\r\nde traveler caught one by de tail an' put him inside a kiver-lid dish\r\nwhat was settin' dere on de table, an' he tole Ole Massa tell John he\r\ncould eat sumpin' out of ev'y dish atter dey got th'oo but dat kiver-lid\r\none, an' not to take kiver offen hit. An' John said, 'Nossuh, I won't.'\r\nBut John jes' nachully had to see what was in dat dish, so he raise de\r\nlid, an' out hopped de mouse. Den hyar come Old Massa an' axed John\r\niffen he done what he tole him not to do, an' John 'nied hit. Den de\r\ntraveler look in de dish an' de mouse wan't dere, an' he said, 'See\r\ndere, John been lyin' to you all de time, you jes' ain't knowed hit,'\r\nan' I reckon he right 'caze us had to lie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharity Grigsby\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Charity Grigsby*\r\n    --_R.P.

Dey was all tol'able good to us; but dey would\r\nwhoop us if we wasn't 'bedient; jes' like a mother raisin' a chile.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say how old I is; it's done got away from me; but I was a\r\nstroppin' gal durin' de war. I knows I's eighty-five an' I 'spects I's\r\nmore dan dat. I's de mammy of 'leven chilluns; I knows dat; but ain't\r\nbut five of dem a-livin'. As you knows, I lives wid two of dem; Mattie\r\nan' Evie. Dey treats me good. Hattie an' Ellen an' my boy lives in\r\nBessemer. Dat is all my individual chilluns, but I's got a few others. I\r\ncan't recollect much to tell; been a good while since de war; but when\r\nyou calls it to my 'memberance I can think it up.\r\n\r\n\"Honey, dem nigger dogs; dey sho' did run. Sometimes dey kotched a\r\nnigger, but dey didn't never run me. I was in de house weavin' an'\r\nspinnin' lak mistus showed me; an' I didn't never get in no trouble wid\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\n\"An' den again, Marse Jim was purty tol'able good to us, but Mr. Ervin\r\nLavendar was sho' mean to his niggers, an' his plantation warn't far\r\nfrom our'n. He had a pack of dogs what run de niggers; an' dem was\r\nskeery times, I tell you. Us didn't l'arn no schoolin' nor go nowhere\r\nnor have no corn shuckin' nor nothin'; jes' 'quired to stay in de\r\ncabins. I hyared 'bout Bre'r Rabbit an' hoodoo; but I never takes up no\r\ntime wid dat foolishness; never seed no sense in it. Us got on all right\r\n'thout dat.\r\n\r\n\"Some of de other niggers 'sides me was all de time in trouble, dough.\r\nMr. Fulton, who lived clost to Mr. Lavendar, had a nigger-driver an'\r\noverseer name Sanders, an' I bet he was de meanest one of dem all. You\r\nknow, honey, dey planted wheat fields in de fall in dem days an' cut it\r\nin de spring. It would come off in time 'nuff to make corn.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was a flock of birds lak blackbirds; only dey was wheat birds; an'\r\ndey went in droves an' fly way up yonder. Us had planks to slap together\r\nto keep de birds out er de wheat, because dey et it up.\r\n\r\n\"Well'm, one day Mr. Sanders tol' one of de women what was one of de\r\nsucklers on de place, dat if she wouldn't do what he axed her to dey was\r\na black coffin over her haid. She 'fused him; so when he was loadin' his\r\ngun dere in de wheat fiel', he was holdin' de gun barrel propped under\r\nhis chin, jes' so, an de other end settin' on de ground. Well sir, it\r\nwent off an' he killed hisse'f stid of dat sucklin' woman; an' dat was a\r\nawful time, 'ca'se de niggers got skeered an' run, an' dey sot Mr.\r\nLavendar's pack of nigger dogs on 'em. De dogs kotched some an' chewed\r\n'em nigh 'bout to death. It warn' none of us, but it were close.\r\n\r\n\"Us laid low, didn't go out nowhere. Us wasn't 'lowed to; couldn't go to\r\nprayer meetin' or nothin'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Charity Grigsby's House, Livingston, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"You ax what dat song I singin' when you come? Dat was all of it, an'\r\ndat's 'nuff fer me, 'ca'se it's true. What dey gwine to be no mo' fer?\r\nJes':\r\n\r\n    Angels in de water, walkin' by de light;\r\n    Po' sinners stan' in darkness an' cannot se de light.\r\n\r\n\"I don' want no mo' myse'f; jes' dat; dat's all.

I'll tell you some mo' when I gets my mind on it, 'ca'se it's been\r\na good while since de war.\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm, us has 'nuff to eat; but if us could get anymore, us would lak\r\nit.

Most\r\nof de things us used was made raght dere on de plantation, sich as:\r\nbeds, buckets, tools, soap, brogans, breeches, an' chairs. Our\r\nmattresses was either made outen cornshucks or cotton bolls. Us cooked\r\non an open fireplace, an' eve'y Sadday night us would go to de big house\r\nfor supplies. Marse Ben was good to his slaves an' he 'lowed dem to have\r\na little plot of groun' nex' to de cabins whar dey could raise dere own\r\nlittle crop.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy was a fiel' han' an' my pappy was a mechanic an' he use to be\r\nde handy man aroun' de big house, makin' eve'thing f'um churns an'\r\nbuckets to wagon wheels. My pappy also useta play de fiddle for de white\r\nfolks dances in de big house, an' he played it for de colored frolics\r\ntoo. He sho could make dat thing sing.\r\n\r\n\"Us useta have all sorts of cures for de sick people, f'rinstance, us\r\nused de Jerusalem weed cooked wid molasses into a candy for to give to\r\nde chilluns to git rid of worms. Den us'd bile de root an' make a kinda\r\ntea for de stomach worms. You know de kinds dat little puppies an'\r\nlittle chilluns has dat eats all de food dat goes in to de stomach, an'\r\nmakes de chile or dog eat plenty but don't git no benefits f'um all\r\ndey're eatin'. Horehound, dat growed wild in Clarke County, was used for\r\ncolds. Mullen tea was used for colds an' swollen j'ints. Den dere was de\r\nlife everlastin' tea dat was also good for colds and horse mint tea dat\r\nwas good for de chills an' fevers. Co'se, Mistis, us niggers had a\r\nregular fambly doctah dat 'tended to us when we was sho 'nough down\r\nraght sick, but dese remedies I's tellin' you 'bout us used when warn't\r\nnothin' much ailin' us. It was always to de owner's interest, Mistis, to\r\nhave de niggers in a good, healthy condition.\r\n\r\n\"Does I believe in spirits, you says? Sho I does. When Christ walked on\r\nde water, de Apostles was skeered he was a spirit, but Jesus told dem\r\ndat he warn't no spirit, dat he was as 'live as dey was. He tol' 'em dat\r\nspirits couldn't be teched, dat dey jus' melted when you tried to. So,\r\nMistis, Jesus musta meant dat dere was sich a thing as spirits.\r\n\r\n\"Atter de war my pappy an' mammy stayed on de Duncan plantation en'\r\nworked on share crops. Dere was a school on de groun's for us slave\r\nchilluns, an' my gran'mammy, Salina Duncan, taught de bible, 'ca'se she\r\nwas f'um Virginny an' had been learnt to read an' write by her Mistis up\r\ndere.\r\n\r\n\"My fus' wife was named Alice Bush, an' us had ten chilluns; my second\r\none was named Caroline Turner an' us didn't have but eight.

He had\r\nexperienced much but one incident had out-lasted all the others--even\r\nthe stroke that made him older and more feeble. That experience had\r\ncaused Gabe and his \"ole woman\" to stray far from the fold and to walk\r\nall the way back to its shelter.\r\n\r\nThat was back in Reconstruction days, when he was not \"bandy in his\r\nknees\" and long before Anna left him alone in his cabin with just\r\nmemories of earlier and happier days.\r\n\r\nGabe was \"birthed in Cusseta, Georgia,\" the son of two faithful old\r\nslaves, Hetty and Gabe Hines, and they \"all 'longed to Marsa William\r\nShipp an' Miss Ma'y. He told his story thus:\r\n\r\n\"Endurin' of de Wah, I was big enough to be water toter on de\r\nplantation. No, Li'l Missy, I doan' 'zactly know how old I is 'ceptin'\r\nby de squeakin' an' achin' of my bones. I 'members lots 'bout doze days.\r\nDem was happy times, Li'l Missy.

But she caint stay long when she come.\r\n\r\n\"I was a-tellin' 'bout Silver Run. Arter we was mahied and was gittin'\r\nuse to bein' free niggahs, an' happy in our cabin, one night a gen'ulman\r\nfrom de no'th was to see us an' he tol' us if we'd go wid him he'd pay\r\nus big wages an' gin us a fine house to boot.\r\n\r\n\"Fer two nights we sot dere by dat chimbly a-thinkin' a sight to do or\r\nto don't and ponderin' this way and t'other one. Den we 'cided to go. We\r\nlef ev'y thing dar 'ceptin' whut we tied up in a bandana han'chief, and\r\nwe tied that onto a stick for de gen'ulman from de no'th wouldn't let us\r\ntake no baggage. We was goin' to Columbus, Georgia, but we didn't know\r\ndat.\r\n\r\n\"Li'l Missy, when we got dar, whar he was a-takin' us, we foun' the big\r\nwages to be fifty cents a month, and dat fine house tu'ned out to be mo'\r\nlike a stable. Instid of our cabin and gyarden and chickens and our\r\ntrees, we had a turrible place, right out under the hot sun wid watah\r\nmiles away down a hill. And he wan't no gent'man from de no'th!\r\n\r\n\"Missy, I nebber will be able to tell myself whut made us do hit no mo'\r\nden I'll ebber be able to tell how skeered I was one night when de wind\r\nhowled an' de lightnin' was sprayin' ober de place an' de rain was so\r\nturrible hit was a-sobbin' in de fire.

We tipped\r\nto de do' an' peeked out an', li'l Missy, whut we seed was so turrible\r\nour eyes jes' mos' popped out our haid. Dere was a million hosses all\r\nkivered in white, wid dey eyes pokin' out and a-settin' on de hosses was\r\nmen kivered in white too, tall as giants, an' dey eyes was a-pokin' out\r\ntoo. Dere was a leader an' he heldt a bu'nin' cross in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"When we seed dat, we fell on our po' knees, skeered mos' to def an' we\r\naxed de Great Marster to holp two po' ol' niggers an' holp 'em quick.\r\n\r\n\"De fust thing we knowed dem Ku Kluxes had de gen'man from de no'th out\r\nof his hidin' place 'hind our house an' a-settin' on one of dem hosses.\r\nDey nebber spoke wid him.

Prine, [HW: Mobile?]_\r\n\r\n_HONGRY FOR PUN'KIN PIE_\r\n\r\n'Aunt' Adeline, a tall, gaunt, bright-skinned Negro woman, lives on Frye\r\nSt., Mobile, Ala. The day I called she was nodding in a cane bottom\r\nrocking chair on a wide porch that extended across the front of a\r\ncottage almost hidden in a grove of giant oaks. She opened her eyes,\r\nwhich were covered by a pair of steel-rimmed glasses with one lens badly\r\ncracked. The news that a search was being made for old people who had\r\nlived during slavery days acted like an electric shock on the old woman,\r\nwho immediately sat up straight and said:\r\n\r\n\"Lor, yes'm, I libed in dose days, and I tells you I 'members all 'bout\r\ndem. Do come in and set down. De fust white people I b'longed to was a\r\nman named Jones, who was a colonel in de war, but I can't tell you much\r\n'bout dem, 'caze I was jes' a li'l gal den. I was jes' big 'nuff to tote\r\nwater to de fiel' to de folks wukking and to min' de gaps in de fence to\r\nkeep de cattle out when dey was gatherin' de crops. I don't 'spec' you\r\nknows anything 'bout dose kind of fences. Dey was built of rails and\r\nwhen dey was gatherin' de crops dey jes' tuk down one section of de\r\nfence, so de wagons could git through.\r\n\r\n\"A'ter de war broke out ole Mister Jones went off to hit, and I 'members\r\nde day he lef'. He come to de fiel' to tell all de han's goodbye, wid a\r\nbig white plume on his hat. Dat was in Bolivar County, Mississippi.\r\nA'ter ol' Mister Jones lef' for de war, den de nigger drivers an'\r\noberseer begun to drive us 'round lack droves of cattle. Every time dey\r\nwould hyar de Yankees was coming dey would take us out in de woods and\r\nhide us. Finally dey sold us a'ter carrying us away from Bolivar County.\r\nSome of us was sold to people in Demopolis, Alabama, an' Atlanta,\r\nGeorgia, an' some to folks in Meridian and Shubuta, Mississippi. I don't\r\nany more know whar my own folks went to dan you does.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members afore leaving ole Mister Jones' place how dey grabbed up all\r\nde chillun dat was too li'l to walk and puttin' us in wagons. Den de\r\nolder folks had to walk, and dey marched all day long. Den at night dey\r\nwould strike camp. I has seen de young niggers what was liable to run\r\naway wid dere legs chained to a tree or de wagon wheels. Dey would rake\r\nup straw and throw a quilt ober hit and lie dat way all night, while us\r\nchillun slep' in de wagons.\r\n\r\n\"When us come to de big river at Demopolis, Alabama, I 'members seein'\r\nde big steamboats dere, and dey said dat de sojers was goin' away on\r\ndem. Hit was in Demopolis us was sold, and a man name Ned Collins of\r\nShubuta, Mississippi, bought me.\"\r\n\r\n'Aunt' Adeline said that the houses the slaves lived in on the Jones\r\nplantation were board houses, and that Mr. Jones owned a big plantation\r\nand lots of slaves. She said that they had home-made beds, nailed to the\r\nwalls, with mattresses made out of shucks.\r\n\r\nAfter having been sold to Mr. Collins, of Shubuta, Mississippi, 'Aunt'\r\nAdeline said that life was very hard, not so much for herself, but she\r\nsaw how hard the other slaves worked. She was the house girl and helped\r\nclean house, wash dishes, and take care of the children. After finishing\r\nthat work, she had to spin thread. Each day she would have to spin so\r\nmany cuts, and if she did not finish the required number, she was\r\npunished.\r\n\r\nShe said that her mistress kept the finished work on top of a large\r\nwardrobe, and 'Aunt' Adeline said that many times she would steal a cut\r\nof thread off that wardrobe to complete the day's task to keep from\r\nbeing punished.\r\n\r\nAs she grew older she did have to go to the field and pick cotton.\r\n'Aunt' Adeline does not remember it pleasantly. She said:\r\n\r\n\"I jes' hates to hab to weigh anything today, 'caze I 'members so well\r\ndat each day dat de slaves was given a certain number of pounds of\r\ncotton to pick. When weighing up time come and you didn't hab de number\r\nof pounds set aside, you may be sho' dat you was goin' to be whupped.\r\nBut hit wasn't all bad times 'caze us did hab plenty to eat, 'specially\r\nat hog killin' time. Dey would hab days ob hog killin' and de slaves\r\nwould bake dere bread and come wid pots, pepper, and salt. A'ter\r\ncleanin' de hogs, dey would gib us de livers and lights, and us would\r\ncook dem ober a fire out in de open and hit sho' was good eatin'. De\r\nusual 'lowance a week of pickled pork was six or seven pounds, and iffen\r\nyou had a big family of chillun dey gib you more. Den dey gib you a peck\r\nof meal, sweet 'taters, sorghum syrup, and plenty of buttermilk. At\r\nChristmas times, dey gib you extra syrup to make cakes wid and sweet\r\n'taters to make 'tater pone. And, Lor', dey would hab big cribs of\r\npun'kins. Hit makes me hongry to think 'bout dem good ol' pun'kin pies.\r\n\r\n\"And did dey raise chickens? You knows in Mississippi dat de minks was\r\nbad 'bout killin' dem. I 'members one time de minks got in de chicken\r\nhouse and killed nearly every chicken on de place. Ole Mister Jones had\r\nde cook to clean and cook dem, and he come out in de fiel' an' eat wid\r\ndem to let de slaves know dat hit was all right. Den us had dem good ol'\r\ncushaws and lye hominy, too.\r\n\r\n\"De clothes was made out ob homespun in one piece. I 'members I allus\r\nhad mine split up de side so I could git 'bout in a hurry. De women had\r\npantalettes made and tied to dere knees to wear in de fields to keep de\r\ndew off dere legs. De shoes was made of cow hide and was called red\r\nrussets. De way dey got dem darker was to take a hog 'gristle' and hang\r\nup in de chimbley. When hit git full of soot, we rub de shoes wid dat.\r\nDen dey used de darker shoes for dere Sunday best.\r\n\r\n\"You asked me about huntin'? Lor', yes dey hunted in dem times. Up in\r\ndem swamps in Mississippi dere was bears as big as cows, and deers\r\naplenty. Dey bofe was bad about comin' in de corn fiel's and tearin'\r\ndown de corn. You could hyar dem at nights out in de fiel's. Dey also\r\ncaught plenty of possums and coons.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, us got sick, but dey had de doctor. In dose days de doctor\r\nwould cup you and bleed you. I seen a many a person cupped. De doctor\r\nhad a li'l square lookin' block of wood wid tiny li'l knifes attached to\r\nhit. On top was a trigger lack is on a gun, and de doctor would put de\r\nblock of wood at de nape of dere neck an' pull dat trigger. Den he hab a\r\npiece of cotton wid somepin' on hit to stop de blood when he had cupped\r\nyou long 'nough. Dey would allus gib us calamus (calomel) to clean us\r\nout, and den de nex' mawnin' dey gib us a big bowl of gruel made out ob\r\nmeal and milk. Den us'd be all right.\r\n\r\n\"De slaves warn't 'lowed to go to church, but dey would whisper 'roun'\r\nand all meet in de woods and pray. De only time I 'members my pa was one\r\ntime when I was a li'l chile, he set me on a log by him an' prayed, an'\r\nI knows dat was whar de seeds ob religion was planted in my min'. Today\r\nI's happy to tell folks 'bout Jesus and thank Him for His goodness to\r\nme. Hit won't be long twell I meet Him face to face and thank Him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaroline Holland\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Caroline Holland*\r\n    --_Mabel Farrior_\r\n\r\n_CAROLINE HOLLAND HAD MANY MASTERS_\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, I was a slave,\" spoke Aunt Carry from her vine-shaded porch at\r\nNo. 3 Sharpe Street, Montgomery, Alabama. \"I was borned in 1849 on Mr.\r\nWill Wright's plantation on the Mt.

De nex' day de oberseer an' de\r\npattyrollers went a searchin' th'ough de slave quarters an' dey foun' de\r\nmoney bag under Jade's cot. Dey tuk him an' whupped him for near fifteen\r\nminutes. We could hear him holla way up at de big house. Jade, he neber\r\ngot ober dat whuppin'. He died three days later. He was a good nigger,\r\n'peer to me lak, an' de bes' blacksmith in de whole county. I\r\nke'pa-wonderin' whut made him want ter steal dat purse. Den I foun' out\r\nlater dat he was a goin' to pay a white man ter carry him ober de line\r\nto de No'thern States. Jade jus' had too big ideas fo' a nigger. I us'ta\r\nsee Jade's ghos' a walkin' out in de garden in de moonlight; sometime he\r\nsit on de fence an' look at his ole cabin, den sometimes he stroll off\r\ndown de cotton fiel'. When de Lawd git th'ough a punishin' him fo' a\r\nstealin' dat money, I guess he won't make us no mo' visits. He jus' go\r\nright on in heaben. Dat's what ghos'tes is, you know; peoples dat can't\r\nquite git in heaben, an' dey hadda stroll 'roun' little longer on de\r\noutside repentin'.\r\n\r\n\"Soon atter dat my gardeen tuk me to Tallasse when de massa died. My\r\ngardeen was a good man. He was always a-makin' speeches fo' de slaves to\r\nstay under bondage till dey was twenty-one. One dey he was in front of a\r\nsto' talkin' 'bout de slaves an' a man come up to him an' said he don't\r\nlike de way Capt. Clanton talk (dat was my gardeen's name). Capt.\r\nClanton ask him whut he goin' ter do 'bout it an' de man tuk out a\r\npistol an' kil't de Cap'n raght dere on de spot.\r\n\r\n\"Den I was sold to another man, a Mr. Williamson, 'bout de time de war\r\nbroke loose, an' Massa Williamson tuk me ober ter lib wid some mo'\r\npeoples. He said he had mo' slaves dan he could take keer of. Dis was de\r\nAbernathy plantation. While de massa was a standin' in de slave quarters\r\na takin' to Mr Abernathy, I noticed a boy wid a bad eye. I didn't lak\r\nhim at all an' I tol' de massa I don't wanna stay, kaze I didn't lak de\r\nway dat boy Lum wid de bad eye looked at me. Den Mr. Abernathy brung a\r\nboy 'bout sebenteen year old; a big strong lookin' boy named Jeff. He\r\nsay 'Jeff, look out after Carry here. Don't let her git into no\r\ntrouble.' Fum dat time on till 'bout five year ago, Jeff he always look\r\nafter me, kaze atter de war I ma'ied him.

Jus' as sho' as you is\r\nstandin' dar, lady, I seed dem mens all dressed in blue suits,\r\na-marching' side by side, gwine down de road pas' our place. It tuk 'em\r\nthree days to go by our house.\r\n\r\n\"An' I remembers when dem Yankees came to our ole Mistis' house an' take\r\na ladder an' clumb up to de roof an' tear de boards outter de ceilin' to\r\ngit dem big hams an' shoulders my white folks done had hid up dar. When\r\nde Yankees find dat stuff dey give it all to de niggers. Den atter de\r\nsolgers lef' ole Miss called us to her an' tol' us we was free, but for\r\nus to give back some of de meat an' things dat de Yankees done give us,\r\n'ca'se she didn't have nothin' to eat 'roun' de place. 'Course we was\r\nglad to do it, 'ca'se Mistis sho' was good to us.\r\n\r\n\"I remembers ebery Sunday mawnin' dat she'd make de older slaves bring\r\nall de little niggers up to de big house, so she could read de Bible to\r\n'em, and den she give us plenty of dem good biscuits and taters dat\r\nSusanne cook for us. She'd say: 'Git 'roun' dere, Susanne, and he'p dem\r\nlittle niggers' plates.' I really thought Mistis was a angel.\r\n\r\n\"Talkin' 'bout niggers bein' free. Ole Miss tol' us was free, but it was\r\nten or twelve years atter de surrender befo' I knowed whut she meant. I\r\nwas a big boy goin' to school befo' I had an understandin' as to what\r\nshe meant.\r\n\r\n\"Ole Miss taught de niggers how to read an' write an' some of 'em got to\r\nbe too good at it, 'ca'se dey learned how to write too many passes so's\r\nde pattyrollers wouldn't cotch 'em, an' on dem occasions was de onlyes'\r\ntimes dat I ever seed one of our niggers punished.\r\n\r\n\"Mistis never 'lowed no mistreatin' of de slaves, 'case dey was raisin'\r\nslaves for de market, an' it wouldn't be good bizness to mistreat 'em.\r\nLor' Miss, my white folks was rich; dey had as many as five or six\r\nhundred niggers; men, women an' chilluns. De plantation was big, but I\r\ndoesn't remember how many acres it was, but I does remember dat de\r\ncabins was all built in rows, an' dere was streets laid out among de\r\ncabins. De chimneys was built outten dirt an' sticks, an' you know up in\r\nVirginny it got powerful cold, so when dey built de cabins dey th'owed\r\ndirt up under 'em to keep de wind an' snow out.\r\n\r\n\"I was bawn in Henry County, Virginny, near Danville, an' I's been to\r\nVicksburg an' Petersburg a many a time wid my pappy to de wheat an'\r\n'bacca market. Lor', honey, Virginny is de bes' place on earth for good\r\neaten' an' good white folks. If anybody tells you dat de white folks was\r\nmean to dere niggers, dey neber come from Virginny, 'case us was too\r\nnear de free states, an' I done already tol' you dat dey raised niggers\r\nto sell an' dey kep' 'em in good condition. In dose days white folks an'\r\nblack folks was black folks. Jus' lak Booker T. Washington was a riber\r\nbetween de niggers of dis generation an' learnin'. He had all dat was\r\nfine an' good, an' he give de bes' to his people iffen dey would take\r\nit. Dat was de way wid de white folks den; dey didn't do no whuppin'.\r\n\r\n\"I's de onlyes' rat lef' in de pond, an' 'case I ain't hung in de smoke\r\nhouse, folks thinks I's not as old as I say I is, but chile, I's been\r\nhere a long time. I 'members how black Sam useta preach to us, an' when\r\nI growed up I useta think warnt nobody Christians cep'n us Babtists, but\r\nI know better now, an' de longer I lives de mo' I realizes dat de\r\nchurches go 'way 'case dey leaves off de ordinances of God, although us\r\nhas a Bible an' mo' Christian readin' dan ever befo'.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy's name was Eliza Rowlets an' my pappy's was Joseph Holmes. My\r\npappy had de same name as de peoples dat owned him an' my gran'mammy\r\nname was Lucy Holmes. Gran'mammy Holmes lived to be over a hundred years\r\nold, an' she was de fust pusson I ever seed daid. In dem days it tuk\r\nthree days to bury a pusson, 'case dey dug de graves as deep as de\r\ncorpse was tall.\r\n\r\n\"Land sakes a-livin', us had great times, an' I forgot to tell you dat\r\nus had home-made beds wid two sides nailed to de wall an' de mattresses\r\nwas made outen wheat straw.\r\n\r\n\"As for huntin' I done plenty of it an' one thing I got to git\r\nforgiveness for was when I lef' Virginny, I lef' 'bout fifty or sixty\r\nsnares set to cotch rabbits an' birds.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy had eight chilluns an' we was raised in pairs. I had a sister\r\nwho come along wid me, an' iffen I jumped in de river she done it too.\r\nAn' iffen I go th'ough a briar patch, here she come along too.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout de fruit; it makes my mouth water to think about dem cheese\r\napples, dat was yaller lak gold, an' dose Abraham apples, an' de cherry\r\ntree as big as dese oaks here. I's eaten many a big sugar and sweetheart\r\ncherry. But dere was another kind called de Gorilla dat growed as big as\r\nde yaller plums down dis way. Now let me tell you somp'n 'bout Virginny;\r\n'dey had dere laws 'bout drink. Dey had de bes' peach an' cherry brandy\r\nan' mos' any kin' you eber heared of, but dey didn't 'low you to make\r\ndrink outten anything you could make bread wid; sich as corn or rye. Us\r\nhad our brandy same as you would coffee, 'case it was cold, an' some\r\nmawnin's my pappy would git de brandy out an' my mammy would putt a\r\nlittle water an' sugar wid it an' gib it to us chilluns. Us neber\r\nthought nothin' 'bout drinkin'. I kinda believes lak dat ole infidel\r\nIngersoll who said dat anything dat was a custom was dere religion.\r\n\r\n\"Now you axed about hog-killin' time? Dat was de time of times. For\r\nweeks de mens would haul wood an' big rocks, an' pile 'em together as\r\nhigh as dis house, an' den have several piles lak dat 'roun' a big hole\r\nin de groun' what had been filled wid water. Den jus' a little atter\r\nmidnight, de boss would blow de ole hawn, an' all de mens would git up\r\nan' git in dem pig pens. Den dey would sot dat pile of wood on fire an'\r\nden start knockin' dem hogs in de haid. Us neber shot a hog lak us does\r\nnow; us always used an axe to kill 'em wid. Atter knockin' de hog in de\r\nhaid, dey would tie a rope on his leg an' atter de water got to de right\r\nheat, fum dose red-hot rocks de hog would be throwed in an' drug aroun'\r\na while, den taken out an' cleaned. Atter he was cleaned he was cut up\r\ninto sections an' hung up in de smoke house. Lawsie, lady, dey don't\r\ncure meat dese days; dey jus' uses some kind of liquid to brush over it.\r\nWe useta have sho' 'nuff meat.\r\n\r\n\"Den come cawnshuckin' time. My goodness, I would jus' love to be dar\r\nnow. De cawn would be piled up high an' one man would git on dat pile.\r\nIt was usually a kinda nigger foreman who could sing an' git de work\r\noutten de niggers. Dis fo'man would sing a verse somp'n lak dis:\r\n\r\n    Polk and Clay went to war,\r\n    Polk come back wid a broken jaw.\r\n\r\nDen all de niggers would sing back at him wid a kinda shoutin' sound.\r\nNear 'bout all de times de fo'man made up his own songs, by pickin' dem\r\nouten dat shuckin'! It war de jug dat dey brung aroun' eve'y hour. Dat's\r\nde onlyes' time de slaves really got drunk.\r\n\r\n\"In dem ole days I went to plenty of dances an' candy pullin's durin' de\r\nYule season, but I doesn't do dat no mo'. I's a preacher an' when I fus'\r\nlef' Virginny, I come to Georgy an' stayed dar twenty years whar I\r\nkicked up plenty of dus'. I even taught school dar. Den I come to\r\nAlabamy an' lived in Evergreen for 'bout twenty mo' years. Since I been\r\nin Mobile I's worked for sich men as ole Simon, Damrich, an' Van\r\nAntwerp, an' all dere chilluns has been in dese here arms of mine. I's\r\nbeen a square citizen an' dere hasn't been a time dat I is had to call\r\non nobody but Uncle Sam when ole man 'pression cotched me. But thank de\r\nLawd I is still able to git about an' have all my senses 'cep' my\r\neye-sight, an' it's jus' a little po'ly. I is got all my teeths 'cep'\r\none, an' my mammy was always proud of my hair. See how silky an' fine it\r\nis? Not quite white, dough. I hope I lives long enough for it to turn\r\nwhite as snow.

Tall, straight, with gray hair and\r\nmustache, he was a picturesque figure. He does not know whether he was\r\nborn in slavery, he said, but he knows his age to be about eighty-one.\r\n\r\n\"I doesn't know whether I was a slave, but jes' de same I seed Gineral\r\nGrant's army when hit went th'ough Virginny,\" he said \"Jes' as sho' as\r\nyo' is standin' dar, lady, I seed him, and I seed dem men all dressed in\r\ndem blue suits a-marchin' side by side, gwine down de road pas' our\r\nplace.

I sho' does. De\r\nwomen folks makes de slaves hide wid de meat; an' when dem Yankees fin'\r\ndat stuff dey jes' gib hit all tuh de niggers, an' I 'members too, how\r\nOl' Miss calls us all to her atter dey lef' an' tole us dat us was free,\r\nbut she tole us dat us hab tuh gib back ob de meat an' 'serves 'case she\r\ndidn't hab a bit tuh eat. 'Cose we was glad tuh do hit 'case Ol' Miss\r\nsho' was good tuh her slaves.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members ebery Sunday mawnin' dat she made de older slaves bring all\r\nde little niggers up to her big white, two-story house, so she could\r\nread de Bible to us, an' den she gib us plenty dem good biscuits an'\r\n'taters dat she had de cook, Susanne, cook for us. She'd say 'Git 'roun'\r\ndere, Susanne, an' he'p dem li'l niggers plates,' I, railly thought Ol'\r\nMiss was an angel.\r\n\r\n\"Talkin 'bout niggers bein' freed, Ol' Miss tole us us was free, but hit\r\nwas ten or twelve years atter de Surrender, befo' I knowed whut she was\r\ntalkin' 'bout. I was a big boy goin' to school befo' I had any\r\nunderstanin' as tuh whut she meant.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Miss taught de niggers how to read an' write, an' some ob dem got\r\nto be too 'ficient wid de writin', 'case dey larn how tuh write too many\r\npasses so de pattyrollers wudn't git dem. Dat was de onliest time I\r\nebber knowed Ol' Miss tuh hab de slaves punished.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Miss nebber 'lowed no mistreatin' de slaves, case dey was raisin'\r\nslaves for de market, an' hit wouldn't be good business to mistreat 'em.\r\nLor' mah white folks was rich; dey had as many as five or six hundred\r\nniggers, men, women and chillun. De plantation was big but I don't\r\n'member how many acres I does 'member de cabins was all built in rows,\r\nan' streets was laid out 'tween de cabins. De chimbeys was built outta\r\ndirt an' sticks, an' sticks, an' yo' know up in Virginny hit got\r\nturrible cold an' de snow would pile up, so when de cabins was built, de\r\nmen th'owed dirt up under de house to keep de snow an' cold out. Yo'\r\nmight think dat dirt would wash out from under de house, but hit didn't.\r\nHit jes' made dem so warm an' com'fo'ble we did'nt suffer.\r\n\r\n\"Dat was de way wid de white folks den; dey didn't do no whippin' an'\r\nmistreatin' ob de slaves. Oh, once in a while Ol' Miss might slap de\r\ncook's face an' tell her tuh bear down 'roun' dere, an' if she wanted de\r\nservin' boys to hurry, she would say 'Cutch hit,' meanin' fer dem to cut\r\nsome steps an' git 'bout in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\"I's de ol'est rat in de pon', an' 'case I ain't hung in de smokehouse,\r\nfolks think I's not as ol' as I says I is, but chile, I's been heah. I\r\n'members how Sam useta to preach to us, when we was at Ol' Miss's place,\r\nan' when I growed up, I 'members how I useta think nobody was a\r\nChristian 'ceptin' us Baptists, but I knows better now. An' de longer I\r\nlib de mo' I realize dat de chu'ches go away 'case dey leabes off de\r\nordinances ob God, 'tho us has got de Bible an' mo' Christian\r\nlitterchoor dan eber befo'.\r\n\r\n\"My ma's name was 'Liza Rowlets, an' mah daddy's name was Joseph Holmes.\r\nMy daddy had de same name as de people whut owned him, an' my gran'ma's\r\nname was Lucy Holmes. Gran'ma Lucy libed to be a hundred yeahs old, an'\r\nshe was de fust pusson I ebber seed daid. Hit tuk three days tuh bu'y a\r\npusson den, 'case dey dug de graves as deep as yo' is tall, which means\r\nmo' than five feet deep. Lor' sakes a-livin' us had great times. I\r\nforgot tuh tell yo' dat us had home-made beds wid two sides nailed tuh\r\nde wall, an' de mattresses was made outta wheat straw. Dat's 'minds me\r\ndat dere wa'n't no pore cattle in dem times, 'case yo' could go whar dey\r\nthresh de wheat an' git all de straw yo' wanted an' feed de dry cattle\r\non hit. An' you wouldn't believe de fruit us did hab! Yo don't nebber\r\nsee de like down dis way. Sich as apples, cherries, quinces, peaches an'\r\npears.\r\n\r\n\"As fer huntin', I done plenty of it, an' one thing I got to git\r\nforgiveness fer was when I lef' Virginny, I lef' 'bout sixty or seventy\r\nsnares set to ketch rabbits an' birds.\r\n\r\n\"My ma had eight chillun an' we was raised in pairs. I had a sister who\r\ncome along wid me, an' if I jumped in de ribber tuh swim, she did hit\r\ntoo; if I clum' a tree, or went th'ough a briar patch, she done hit\r\nright behin' me. Ma wanted to know why her clo's was so tore up, an'\r\nwhen dey was pretty, we'd make hit right wid Ma by havin' a rabbit or\r\ncoon wid us, an' sometimes a mud turtle. An' as fer 'possums an' coons,\r\nus ketch dem in plenty.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout de fruit, hit makes mah mouf watah tuh think 'bout dem cheese\r\napples dat was yaller lac' gold, an' dose Abraham apples de lack of\r\nwhich ain't now to be had. An' dose cherry trees as big as dese oaks,\r\nwid long limbs an' big sugar an' sweetheart, an' black heart cherries.\r\nDen dere was annudder kin' of cherry called de gorilla, dat was roun'\r\nan' growed as big as de yaller plums down dis way.\r\n\r\n\"Now, let me tell yo' sumpin' 'bout Virginny. Hit had hits own law 'bout\r\ndrink. Dey made de bes' peach an' cherry brandy an' mos' any kin' yo'\r\nebber heerd ob, 'ceptin' dey didn't 'low yo' to make drink out ob\r\nanythin' you could make into bread. Now yo' understan's, sich as corn\r\nand rye.\r\n\r\n\"Us had our brandy same as yo' would coffee, 'case hit was cold an' some\r\nmawnin's us would git up an' de snow would be halfway up de do', an' de\r\nmen would hab to ditch hit out, so us could git out of de house. On dem\r\nrail cold mawnin's my daddy would git de brandy out an' my ma wud put a\r\nli'l water an' sugar wid hit an gib to us chillun. An' den she'd take\r\nsome in her mouf' an' put hit in de baby's mouf an' hit wud open hits\r\neyes an' stamp hits foot rail peart lack.\r\n\r\n\"Us nebber thought nothin' of drinkin'. I kinda believes lack dat ol'\r\ninfidel, Ingersoll, who said dat anythin' dat was de custom, was de\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\"Folks was a heap kinder-hearted den dey is now, 'case dey kep' big dogs\r\nto hunt up people los' in de snow. Dey all seemed mo' happy 'case dey\r\nwas all busy. At night instid of wastin' dey time, dey wud go tuh de big\r\nhouse an' spin an' weave an' make clo's.\r\n\r\n\"I kin hyar dat ol' loom hummin' now, an' see great cards ob cloth\r\ncomin' out, an' dem was clo's den dat was made from hit. Hit tuck fire\r\ntuh git dem offen' yo' dey was so strong. I doesn't 'member whut dey\r\nused fer dye, but I knows dey used copperas as sizin' to hol' de colors.\r\nSome of de cloth was dyed red, blue an' black. I jes' can't 'member\r\n'bout de dye, but dey used copperas. 'Dat was the qualification of de\r\nintelligence ob de primitive age', in usin' dat copperas. Dey not only\r\nmade our clo's, but also made out hats. Of co'se dey wa'n't very hatty,\r\nbut was mo' cappy. Dey made 'em wid tabs ober de ears, an' to tie under\r\nde chin, an' was dey warm, I'll say!\r\n\r\n\"Now, when yo' axes 'bout hawg killin' time, dat was de time! Fer weeks\r\nde men would haul wood and big rocks, an' pile hit all together as high\r\nas dat house; den hab sev'ral piles like dese 'roun' a big hole in de\r\ngroun' whut had been filled wid watah. Den jes' a li'l atter mid-night\r\nde boss would blow de ol' horn, an' all de men would git up an' git in\r\ndem hog pens. Den dey would set dat pile of wood on fire, an' den start\r\nknockin' dem hawgs in de haid. Us nebber shot a hawg like dey does now.\r\nUs allus used an ax to kill 'em wid.\r\n\r\n\"Atter knockin' de hawg in de haid, dey would tie a rope on hits leg, an\r\natter de water got to de right heat from dose red hot rocks whut had\r\nbeen pushed out ob dat pile ob nu'in wood into de watah, dey wud th'ow\r\nde hog in an' drag hit aroun' awhile, an' take him out an' hab him clean\r\nin 'bout three pair o' minutes. Atter he was clean dey hung him up, an'\r\nden later cut him up an' hung him in de smoke house, an' smoke him wid\r\ngreat oak logs. Huh, dey don't cu'ah meat now, dey jes' use sum kinda\r\nbrush an' liquid, but dey don't hab meat lack us did.\r\n\r\n\"Den come co'shuckin' time. Mah goodness, I jes' would love to be dere\r\nnow. De co'n would be piled up high an' one man would git on dat pile.\r\nHit usually was one who was kinda niggah fo'man dat could sing an' get\r\nde wuck out of de odder niggers. Dis fo'man would sing a verse somethin'\r\nlack dis:\r\n\r\n    Polk an' Clay went to War,\r\n    An' Polk come back wid a broken jar.\r\n\r\n\"Den all de niggers would sing back to him, an' hallo, a kinder shoutin'\r\nsoun'. Ginerally dis fo'man made up his songs by pickin' dem up from\r\nwhut he had heard white folks tell of wars. But Miss yo' know whut was\r\nde motor powah of dat co'n shuckin'? Hit was de ol' jug dat was brung\r\n'roun' ebery hour. Dat's de onliest time any ob de slaves railly got\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could 'member dose ol' songs, but all dat hallo done lef' me,\r\n'case de onliest singin' I hears now is de good ol' sisters singin' an'\r\nsayin' 'Amen.'\r\n\r\n\"In days gone by I went to plenty of dances an' candy pullin's but I\r\ndoesn't do dat any mo'. I's a preacher, an' when I fu'st lef' Virginny I\r\ncome to Georgia an' stayed dere twenty yeahs, an' I kicked up a plenty\r\nof dust in Georgia.

I found him nodding on\r\nhis front steps.\r\n\r\n\"Josh,\" I said, \"I've come to get you to tell me some old war-time\r\nstories, and I want to ask you some questions about you and Alice and\r\nhow you-all are getting along. I just want to know all about you and\r\nyour family as far back as you can remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Miss Ruby, I's glad to tell you what I knows,\" said Josh,\r\n\"and it ain't gonna be a lot of fibbin', but jes' lak everything was.\r\nI's telling you lak you axed me.\r\n\r\n\"Now, 'bout how us is getting along. I's telling you de troof, ef I was\r\ntook 'fore God, I'd say jes' lak I's saying now, ef my chillun ever et a\r\nmoufful dat wasn't honest, dey et it somewhar else, 'ca'se I ain't ever\r\nstole a moufful somepin' t'eat for 'em in all my life. It's honest\r\nvittles dey et, and varmints I's killed in de woods, 'ca'se us raised\r\nchillun fast, and us had a heap of 'em, sixteen, if I 'members right,\r\nand soon's I found out dat I could help feed 'em dat way, I done a heap\r\nof hunting. And everybody knows I's a good hunter. Alice used to make me\r\ngo every Friday night; den us always had a 'possum or two for Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" I asked, \"didn't you go Saturday night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" Josh said, \"Alice is a good Christian woman, and\r\nshe knowed I'd hunt mighty nigh all night, and she didn't want nobody\r\nsee me coming in Sunday morning wid no gun and no dogs; so I went every\r\nFriday night and went in de week too, and dat holp a lot to feed de\r\nchillun. I don't owe nobody, not a nickel.\r\n\r\n\"I lak to got in debt, when de Government come in and tried to help us\r\nwid dat cotton doings. Dey cut it down so on me, tell I couldn't make\r\nnothing; but I's getting on all right now, and so is my chillun. Us is\r\ngot fourteen living, and dey's all been to school, but ain't but one\r\nbeen to Booker Washington's school, but dey kin all read and write, and\r\nsome of 'em teaching school out here in de country.

It's nine mile and two of dem's back here in de woods\r\nthrough Marse Johnnie's place, but he come when us went atter him 'bout\r\nmidnight, and dat's a comfort to know he come.\"\r\n\r\nI asked, what was the matter with Alice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you, Miss Ruby. She was back dere wid me in de kitchen,\r\nand I got through eating and I come out and set down in de swinger to\r\ngit some air. De moon was shining, and Alice come out, saying loud as\r\nshe could: 'Who is you? Who is you?' De chillun run to her wid a lamp\r\nand I run, and 'twan't nobody dere. Well, Alice said 'twas a big man\r\nstanding right 'side her dressed in black, and she called it Death. Us\r\ncouldn't do nothing wid her, and she didn't know nobody, me nor de\r\nchillun, so I went to Livingston atter Dr. McCain, and he come and set\r\nwid her 'bout a hour. He said 'twas de 'cute 'digestion or somepin' lak\r\ndat. I knowed 'twan't no sperrit; I don't b'lieve in nothing lak dat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I don't know, Josh, I've been hearing some ghost tales\r\nthat freeze the blood in my veins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yassum,\" said Josh, \"if you wants to hear ghost tales, I kin sho tell\r\n'em, ca'se I seed dis here wid my own eyes. 'Tain't no made-up nothing,\r\nneeder; jes' somepin' I seed jes' lak I tells you.\r\n\r\n\"Green Hale and Isham Mathews b'longed to New Hope church, and de\r\nReverend Bird Hall pastored dere. Dey axed me down to hear him preach\r\none night, and us three, me and Green and Isham, was riding along side\r\nand side. I's riding a mule, but it was a fast mule, and Green couldn't\r\nkeep up, en Isham said: 'Somebody been hunting.' I looked up and 'twas a\r\nsapling right 'cross de road. He said, 'Fellow oughten leave nothing lak\r\ndat. When de moon git low, it hit him in de face.' De moon was straight\r\nup and down den, and I said: 'Dat's right', and I's telling you de\r\ntroof, dat sapling jes' riz up, turned aroun' in de air, en de brush\r\npart tickled my mule and Isham's hoss in de face. If you ever seed 'em\r\nbuck and rare and jump up, dey sho did. Den dey took off down de road,\r\nand we didn't hold 'em back, and here come Green. We lef' him behind,\r\n'cause his mule couldn't keep up. If you ever heard a man pray more\r\nearnester dan old Green, I ain't! He come down de road a-yelling: 'Lord,\r\nus live togedder, let us die togedder.' He meant for us to wait on him,\r\nbut I couldn't hold dat mule, and I wan't trying to hold him! I was\r\ngitting away from dar!\r\n\r\n\"When us come togedder, us was a mile from whar us done been, den us had\r\nto decide what to do. Isham said for us to go wid him, and Green said\r\nno, us nearer to his house; but us wan't near to nobody and I was so\r\nscared, hadn't been for Alice, I'd a jes' stayed right whar us was 'tell\r\nsun-up. I said, 'No, every man better take keer his own self,' en us\r\ndid. When I got home, I didn't take nothing off dat mule but myself. I\r\njes' left him standing at de do' wid de saddle on. What skeered Green\r\nso, was a man, he said, what was ridin' right 'side him en didn't have\r\nno head! 'Twas a good thing he didn't tell me dat den, I'd jes' nacherly\r\ndrap dead!\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I don't 'zackly believes in ghosties, but I heared Mr. Marshall\r\nLee say he was riding on home one night and a woman stepped out in de\r\nroad and say: 'Marshall, let me ride.' He say: 'My hoss won't tote\r\ndouble.' She say: 'Yes it will,' and she jump up behind him, and dat\r\nhoss bucked and jumped nigh 'bout from under him, but when he got home,\r\nshe wan't dere. He say, his sister had jes' died and it mout been her.\r\n\r\n\"'Nother time, one Friday night, Alice say us better git a 'possum for\r\nSunday. She say she didn't want none caught atter midnight on Sadday. I\r\nwent down whar I knowed dey was 'simmons, and dem dogs never treed\r\nnothing; dey jes' run 'round dat 'simmon tree lak dey gone crazy. I'm\r\ntelling you de troof, somepin' jump outer dat tree, had a head back'erds\r\nand for'erds and look lak a flame shooting out it eyes! 'Twan't lak no\r\npossum I ever seed, 'twan't lak nothing. Dem dogs, Liz and Roger en\r\nCuba, made a bluge at me. Cotton was waist high, and I run down de\r\ncotton row and cross de road and dey trail me. I say: 'What ail you,\r\ndogs?' And dey jes' come on a-barkin', and dey run me to de bridge over\r\nKonkabyer. So I clumb on de banisters. I seed dey had my trail an dey\r\ngonna ketch me, so I turn 'round and tore out for de slough. Dey lost my\r\ntrail dere and when I got home, 'bout daylight, de thorns and de briars\r\nand all done tore my clothes plum off me. 'Twas t'ree days 'fore I ever\r\nseed dem dogs ag'in.\r\n\r\n\"And I kin tell you somepin' else. It's jes' lak I say, I's always been\r\na hunter, en one night I went down in de post oak woods hunting by\r\nmyself. Dis is a fact; 'tain't no lie. It's what I done. I had a mighty\r\ngood dog, and I jes' kept walking and walking, and I got mighty nigh to\r\nMr. Redhead Jim Lee's place, and I walked on and atter while I seed I'd\r\nlost my dog. I couldn't see him nowhar and I couldn't hear him nowhar,\r\nand den somepin' say to me, jes' lak dis: 'Josh, blow your horn!' Jes'\r\nlak dat, lak somebody talking to me. Well I give three loud, long blows\r\nand set dere awhile longer but dat dog didn't come. Co'se I knowed he'd\r\ncome sometime, and so I jes' set dere on dat log and I jes' turned a\r\nfool, I reckon, but 'twas jes' lak somebody talking to me, lak it\r\n'peared to me was whispering: 'Josh, you out here in dese woods by\r\nyo'self. You blowed dat horn and your enemy heard you. You's a fool, you\r\nis.' And I whispered back: 'Dat's a fact.' I couldn't hear what it was\r\na-whispering to me, but us jes' talk back to one 'nuther, and 'bout dat\r\ntime I look up and here come three men ridin' on new saddles wid shiny\r\nbuckles gwine, 'squeechy, squeechy', jes' lak dat. I hears de hosses\r\nfeed jes' as nachel as could be. I thought sho I seed 'em, and it 'pears\r\nto look clean outer reason, but dem men come riding right on up to me,\r\nand I jump over dat log and lay down flat on de other side, and it look\r\nlak I could see right through dat log and heard 'em say: 'Dar he is, dar\r\nhe is', and I seed 'em p'inting dey finger right whar I was. I knowed\r\ndem hosses gwineter step over de log on top me, and I's telling you de\r\ntroof, I jump up from 'hind dat log and run 'bout two miles, and if it\r\nhadn't been for dat slough, I don't know whar I'd a went. I come to\r\nmyself in de middle of dat water, up to hyar, waist high, and dar was my\r\ndog, old Cuba, done treed a 'possum.\r\n\r\n\"De fust thing I 'members 'bout slave'y time, I wan't nothing but a boy,\r\n'bout fifteen I reckon, dat's what Marse Johnnie Horn say. Us belong to\r\nMarse Ike Horn, Marse Johnnie's pa, right here on dis place whar us is\r\nnow, but dis here didn't belong to me den, dis here was all Marse Ike's\r\nplace. Marse Ike's gin got outer fix and we couldn't get it fixed.\r\nColonel Lee had two gins and one of 'em was jes' below old Turner house.\r\nRecolleck a big old hickory tree? Well dar's whar it was.\r\n\r\n\"I was plenty big 'nough to drive de mules to de gin. Set on de lever\r\nand drive 'em, jes lak a 'lasses mill, so dat night Marse Ike told us he\r\nwant everybody go wid him to Colonel Lee's gin nex' morning, and didn't\r\nwant nobody to git out and go ahead of him. Dat held up de ginning; made\r\nus not go to de ginhouse tell sunup.\r\n\r\n\"Us got de mules and jes' waited. 'Twixt daylight and sunup, us all\r\nstanding dar at de gate and we heared a little fine horn up de road. Us\r\ndidn't know what it meant coming to de house. And bimeby Mr. Beesley,\r\nwhat live not fur from Marse Ike, he rode up and had five dogs, five\r\nnigger dogs, what dey call 'em, and soon as he come, Marse Ike's hoss\r\nwas saddled up and Marse Ike and him rode off down de road and de dogs\r\nwid em, 'head of us. Us followed 'long behind 'em, stay close as dey\r\n'low us, to see what dey was up to. When dey got close to de ginhouse,\r\nginhouse right 'side de road, dey stop us and Mr. Beesley told old Brown\r\nto go ahead. Old Brown was de lead dog and had a bell on him and dey was\r\nfasten togedder wid a rod, jes' lak steers. He turn 'em loose, and den\r\nhe popped de whip and hollered at old Brown and told him 'nigger'. Old\r\nBrown hollered lak he hit. He want to go. And dey was a fence on bofe\r\nsides made it a lane, so he put old Brown over de fence on de ginhouse\r\nside, and told Brown to 'go ahead'. He went ahead and run all aroun' de\r\nginhouse and dey let him in de gin-room and he grabbled in de cottonseed\r\nin a hole.\r\n\r\n\"Den somebody holler 'Guinea Jim', I looks and I didn't see him. Didn't\r\nnobody see him, but dey know dat's whar he been hiding. Mr. Beesley told\r\nold Brown he jes' fooling him, and Old Brown holler ag'in, lak he\r\nkilling him, and Mr. Beesley say: 'Go git dat nigger' and old Brown\r\nstarted 'way from dar lak he hadn't been hunting nothing, but he went\r\naroun' and aroun' dat gin and Mr. Beesley told him he hatter do better\r\ndan dat or he'd kill him, 'cause he hadn't come dar for nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Brown made a circle aroun' dat gin 'way down to de fence dat time, and\r\nhe was so fat he couldn't git through de fence. You know what sort of\r\nfence, a rail fence it was. Den he stop and bark for help. Now I seed\r\ndis wid my own eyes. Dey put Brown on top de fence and he jump way out\r\nin de road, didn't stay on de fence. He jump and run up and down in de\r\nroad, and couldn't find no scent of Jim. You knows how dey used to make\r\ndem rail fences?\r\n\r\n\"Well, Brown come back dar, and dis is de trufe, so help me Gawd. He\r\nbark, look lak, for dem to lift him back up on de fence, and bless God,\r\nif dat dog didn't walk dat rail fence lak he walking a log, as fur as\r\nfrom here to dat gate yonder, and track Jim jes' lak he was on de\r\ngroun'. He fell off once, and dey had to put him back, and he run his\r\ntrack right on to whar Jim jumped off de fence way out in de road. Old\r\nBrown run right cross de road to de other fence and treed ag'in on\r\nt'other side de road toward Konkabia. Old Brown walk de fence on dat\r\nside de road a good piece, jes' lak he done on de other side, and dem\r\nother dogs, he hadn't never turned dem loose.\r\n\r\n\"When Brown he jump off dat fence, he jump jes' as fur as he kin on de\r\nfiel' side, lak he gwine ketch Jim lak a gnat or somepin' and he never\r\nstop barking no more, jes' lak he jumping a rabbit. Den, Mr. Beesley\r\nturn dem other dogs loose dat he hadn't never turned loose, 'ca'se he\r\nsay old Brown done got de thing straight. And he had it straight. Dem\r\ndogs run dat track right on down to Konkabia and crossed it to de\r\nBlacksher side. Dey was a big old straw field dar den and dey cross it\r\nand come on through dat field, all dem dogs barkin' jes' lak dey looking\r\nat Jim. 'Reckley, dey come up on Jim running wid a pine brush tied\r\nbehind him to drag his scent away, but it didn't bother old Brown.\r\n\r\n\"When dem dogs 'gin to push him, Jim drap de brush and runned back\r\ntoward Konkabia. Now on Konkabia dere used to be beavers worse den on\r\nSucarnatchee now. Dey was a big beaver dam 'twixt de bridge and de Hale\r\nplace, and Jim run to dat beaver dam. You know when beavers build dey\r\ndam, dey cut down trees and let 'em fall in de creek, and pull in trash\r\nen brush same as folks, to dam de water up dar tell its knee-deep. De\r\ndogs seen him, old Brown looking at him, jes' 'fore he jump in 'bove de\r\ndam right 'mongst de trash and things dey'd drug in dar. Brown seed him\r\nand he jump in right behind him. Jim jes' dive down under de raff, en\r\nlet he nose stick outer de water. Every once in a while Jim he put he\r\nhead down under, he holding to a pole down dar, and once Mr. Beesley\r\nseed him, he jes' let him stay dar.\r\n\r\n\"Brown would swim 'bout 'mongst de brush, backerds and for'erds, and\r\nterreckly Mr. Beesley tole old Brown, 'Go git him.' Den all de men got\r\npoles and dug 'bout in de raff hunting him. Dey knowed he was dar, en\r\nMarse Ike had a pole giggen aroun' trying to find him too. Den he told\r\nMr. Beesley to give him de hatchet and let him fix he pole. He sharpen\r\nde pole right sharp, den Marse Ike start to jug aroun' wid de pole, and\r\nhe kinder laugh to hisse'f, 'ca'se he knowed he done found Jim. 'Bout\r\ndat time Jim poke he head up and say: 'Dis here me', and everybody\r\nholler. Den he ax 'em please, for God's sake, don't let dem dogs git\r\nhim. Dey told him come on out.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Jim belonged to Miss Mary Lee, Mr. John Lee's Ma, and his Pa\r\nwas kilt in de war, so Mr. Beesley was looking out for her. Well, dey\r\ntook Jim outer dar, and Mr. Beesley whipped him a little and told him:\r\n'Jim, you put up a pretty good fight and I's gwine to give you a start\r\nfor a run wid de dogs.'\r\n\r\n\"Jim took out towards Miss Mary's, and Mr. Beesley helt old Brown as\r\nlong as he could. Dey caught Jim and bit him right smart. You see dey\r\nhad to let em bite him a little to satisfy de dogs. Jim could have made\r\nit, 'cept he was all hot and wore out.\r\n\r\n\"Dat's 'bout all I knows, 'cept us belonged to Marse Ike Horn, and fust\r\nus belonged to Mr. Price Williams, what run de hotel in Livingston. He\r\ntook my gran'ma to Mobile, den he died. Us Ma belonged to dey two\r\nchillun, Miss Nancy Gulley, Mr. Jake's wife, en Miss Burt Blakeney.\r\nMarse Ike Horn was dey uncle, and us all come 'round to him, and us been\r\nhere ever since. My mammy was Ann Campbell, and my pappy was John Horn,\r\nand us ain't never had no trouble wid nobody 'bout nothing.\r\n\r\n\"We's having a barbecue on de fo'th of July and us wants you to come\r\ndown to it, if Alice gits along well, and I's gwine tell you 'bout Rod\r\nand Big John, and John Graverson when dey runned away and about how old\r\nman Jim Devers, Alice's step-pa, hid em in de cave under he house whar\r\ndey had as nice hams as I ever et, co'se a little tainted, but sho was\r\ngood. Dem niggers was fat as beavers, jes' settin' dar eatin' dat meat.\r\n\r\n\"And 'bout de time Marse Ike slip up on a heap of niggers at a frolic\r\n'twixt Sumterville and Livingston and put a end to de frolic. De niggers\r\nhaving a big dance, and Marse Ike and de patterrollers having a big run,\r\nsaid dey wanted to have some fun, and dey did. Said he eased up on 'em\r\nwid a white sheet 'round him and a big brush in he hand, and somehow or\r\n'nother, dey didn't see him tell he spoke. Den he holler 'By God, I'm\r\nbird-blinding,' and he say dem niggers tore down dem dirt chimleys and\r\nrun t'rough dat house. He say he ain't never heerd sich a fuss in a corn\r\nfield in his born days. What he mean 'bout bird-blindin'? When you goes\r\nin de canebrake it so thick, you takes a light to shine de bird's eyes\r\nand blind 'em, den you kin ketch 'em. Dat what he call bird-blindin'.\r\nYassum, Marse Ike in dat too. He couldn't stand for 'em to have no fun\r\n'thout he in it.\r\n\r\n\"Come back on de fo'th of July, and I's gwine tell you some sho-nuff\r\ntales. You sort of caught me when my min' wa'n't zackly on it. I ain't\r\nhad no sleep, jes' settin' 'side de bed by Alice, ketching a nod now and\r\nden. I's too sleepy to sing you no song, but one I laks is dis: It suits\r\nme now in my age:\r\n\r\n    My lates' sun is sinking fas'\r\n    My race in nearly run,\r\n    My strongs' trial now is pas',\r\n    My triump' jes' begun.\r\n\r\n\"You come back and I'll sing de res', I's got to see 'bout things now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma L.

Howard sat in a huge, old-fashioned rocking chair at her\r\nhome, 170 Elmwood St., Montgomery, and sang the old slave song. When she\r\nhad finished, her memory recalled the time, years ago, when she was a\r\nslave on the plantation of William and Georgiana Shepherd in Lowndes\r\nCounty, between Mac's Switch and Morgansville.\r\n\r\n\"Dat was one of de saddest songs we sung endurin' slavery days,\" she\r\nmused. \"It always did make me cry.\"\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment, smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members I was de only light nigger in de fambly,\" she said proudly.\r\n\"I was brung up in de house wid de white chillun. Twice a week I went to\r\nmy mammy's cabin an' took a bath. I had my own sof' shoes an' my own\r\nnightgown an' jacket an' played games wid my massa's chilluns.\"\r\n\r\nShe explained her duties about the Big House as sweeping the rambling\r\nporches and yards. Sometimes she churned. Afterward she would join the\r\nwhite children and played most of the day.\r\n\r\n\"We played hot-scotch, ring-'roun'-the-rosy an' lots of yuther things I\r\ncan't 'member,\" she explained. \"I musta been 'bout seven years old den.\"\r\n\r\nEmma says she is 84 or 85, but she looks older. She remembers very\r\nlittle about her brothers and sisters. She can only recall \"Sist'\r\nCellie, Sist' Harriett an' Sist' Liza.\" Liza helped Aunt Evalina in the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nEmma lifted her eyes toward the ceiling, endeavoring to recall the exact\r\nnumber of servants her master owned.\r\n\r\n\"Edie was de laundress,\" she recalled, \"an' Arrie, she was de weaver.\r\nDen dere was Becky, Melia, Aunt Mary, Ed, John, and Uncle George the\r\nhouse man, who married Aunt Evalina. Jake was de over-looker (overseer).\r\nHe was a great, big cullud man. Dar was more, but I can't 'member. I was\r\njes' a little shaver den.\"\r\n\r\nShe remembers that the Big House was huge and white with a beautiful\r\nparlor and guest room, where the visitors were entertained. Gigantic\r\nwhite columns rose in front of the house, and clusters of magnolias\r\nsurrounded it. The slave houses were located about two hundred yards\r\nback of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Shepherd an' Mistis Georgiana was both good an' treated de\r\nservants kin',\" Emma said. \"I 'members dat I used to keep de flies offen\r\nMistis Georgiana wid a big fan, an' once I went to sleep. She jest laugh\r\nwhen she foun' me sleepin' dar beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Massa would only whup a slave fer two things,\" she recalled. \"One thing\r\nwas if things warn't done up jes' right at hog killin' time, and de\r\nother was iffen a nigger warn't clean when he 'ported for work on Monday\r\nmornin's. Ol' Massa didn't do de whuppin's hisse'f.

We called\r\nhim 'po white trash.' He wasn't thought much of by anybody.\"\r\n\r\nEmma said that everyone went to church on Sundays and that she liked to\r\nsing the old religious hymns. When freedom came all the Shepherd\r\nservants had been taught to read and write, she said, and each family\r\nhad enough money to buy a little home. \"De Marster\" would make each\r\nfamily keep pigs, hens and such; then he would market the products and\r\nplace the money aside for them, Emma explained.\r\n\r\nTalking further about work about the plantation, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Louisa cleaned de parlor an' kept Mistis' room nice.\" She took up a\r\nrecital of work on the plantation. \"Atter dat she didn't do anything but\r\nsew, an' Sist' Liza hoped her wid dat. After de weavin', we done sewin',\r\nand it took a lot of sewin' for dat family. Eve'body had two Sunday\r\ndresses, summer and winter, as well as clothes for eve'day.\r\n\r\n\"For de men's suits de wool had to be took off an' carded an' got ready\r\nto make. But we had plenty of wool from our own sheep.\r\n\r\n\"When dey kilt de hogs for winter meat, dey took some of de hands out of\r\nde field an' let dem ho'p. We had a smokehouse full of hams and\r\nmiddlin's, an' when rainy spells came, us chillun would rake up chips\r\nan' leaves an' make a smudge of smoke to keep de meat sweet.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Shepherd and Miss Georgiana was both mighty kin' hearted an'\r\ntreated their servants good. Once when Marse Shepherd sent us chilluns\r\ndown to de station wid a note, he say, 'Now, go fas'.' But we played\r\n'long the way an' picked flowers. When we come steppin' back, he say, 'I\r\ntold you to hurry.' I held out de flowers an' say, 'See, us brung you\r\nsome flowers;' but he take up a little switch an' nettle my legs good.\r\n\r\n\"Massa always give us plenty of eve'thing. On Friday us worked an'\r\nwashed, an' on Sattidy us cleaned for Sunday. Den on Sunday Massa would\r\ngo 'roun' an' have a mouthful at every house to see dat eve'thing was\r\ndone up jes' right, an' if they wasn't, somebody got a whuppin' next\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"When us went to church on Sunday, Massa Shepherd, Miss Georgiana an' us\r\nthree chilluns rode in de rock-a-way. Dat was a carriage shaped mos'\r\nlike a bowl. De carriage was pulled by two big horses, an' de coachman\r\nwhat sat up on de high seat had on a long double-breasted coat, shiny\r\nblack boots an' a tall silk hat. Massa had on a silk hat, too, but he\r\nwore a tight-waisted coat. An' Miss Georgiana, she look lak a bokay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Emma L.

She liked to wear thin, cool, flowery dresses wid\r\nlots of ruffles an' lace. She also wore a scoop of white straw, mighty\r\nsof' over de years' an' flarin' high an' spreadin' over de face. It was\r\nfilled wid flowers an' tied wid long streamers of ribbon.\"\r\n\r\nEmma said that Mr. Shepherd died during the second year of the war, and\r\nthat it was whispered he was poisoned because he was so good to his\r\nniggers. \"Just before the war closed,\" she said, \"Mrs. Shepherd married\r\nagain and later moved to Texas.\r\n\r\n\"I was took on as a cook by a rich family named Marchiel, in\r\nMontgomery,\" she said. \"Dey treated me lak I was deir own daughter.

He was \"a right good-sized scamp at freedom time\" and\r\nremembers much of what he has seen and heard. He was born in Russell\r\nCounty, the son of Prince and Fanny Ingram. They had seven other\r\nchildren; Jerry, Clara, Rubin, Jep, Lula, Eugene and Lucy.\r\n\r\nEverett says of his life:\r\n\r\n\"Our house in de slave settlement was made of logs an' had one room. It\r\nhad a mud an' stick chimney, a plank floor an' a boxed-up bed wid one\r\nleg at de foot. De mattress was stuffed wid shucks an' straw.\r\n\r\n\"My gran'pappy, Prince Walden, an' Lucy, his wife, come from Russell\r\nCounty, too, an' belonged to de Covingtons. Later dey was sold to Dr.\r\nWalden, at Uchie. When dey come to Uchie de county was full of Indians.\r\nMy gran'pappy useta drink likker wid 'em; but gran'ma, she was skeered\r\nan' runned away to Columbus, Georgy. On her way dere, my mammy was\r\nborned in de woods.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members dat when I was a strip of a boy, dey cooked ash-cake on\r\nleaves an' de chilluns et pot-licker an' bread an' greens outen wooden\r\ntrays wid wooden spoons. Dey would sit under de trees an' eat. Each\r\nfamily had dey own bowl, an' us et a-plenty, too. In cold weather mammy\r\nkept all de chilluns in de house by de fire.\r\n\r\n\"Master had us a two-room house, 'ca'se my mammy was de cook an' weaver.\r\nDey made dey own silk den, too, an' raised de silk worms. Us useta get\r\nmulberry leaves to feed de silk worms wid. Us used indigo, which us\r\ncooked an' used for dye. Us would wear any kind of clothes on everyday\r\nan' Sunday; an' didn't have no shoes 'til us was big chilluns.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Marster an' Ol' Mistus, Mr. Bill an' Miss Lucy Ingram, lived in a\r\nbig weather-boarded house wid a wide hall an' a chimney at each end. De\r\nkitchen was off from de rest of de house.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members dat de overseer useta whip mammy an' pappy, 'ca'se dey fight\r\nso much. He useta take my mammy to de carriage to whip her. Marster was\r\nin de war den. When he come home, de overseer tuk mammy by de han' to de\r\nhouse an' tell Marster 'bout havin' to whip her. He'd jest shake his\r\nhead, sad-lak. He was mighty good to all of us.\r\n\r\n\"My gran'pappy was put in de speculator drove, put on de block an' sold.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members dat Mistus read de Bible to us an' my mammy was converted by\r\nde white preacher. He baptized her. De colored folks used de white\r\nchurch an' set in de back.\r\n\r\n\"An' honey, dey shorely did have good times dancin' on Sattidy nights;\r\nan' sometimes dey would dance 'till Sunday mornin'. When de corn needed\r\nshuckln', it was hauled up near de crib, an' on a purty moonlighted\r\nnight Marster would pass 'roun' de likker. It wouldn't be long 'til dey\r\nwas all happy an' had what dey called a general. De general led all de\r\nhollers an' songs. Dey shorely did get dat corn shucked fast, too.\r\n\r\n\"Gran'mammy was a great doctor; useta give us turpentine an' castor oil\r\nan' Jerusalem oak fer worms. She'd give us all kinds of teas, too. I\r\n'members dat gran'mammy was also a midwife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Everett Ingram, Opelika, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"De Yankees comed through de yard in May an' tol' us: 'You's free.' De\r\nYankees wasn't so good. Dey hung my mammy up in de smokehouse by her\r\nthumbs; tips of her toes jest touchin' de floor, 'ca'se she wouldn't\r\n'gree to give up her older chilluns.

Its rusty hinges and weather-beaten boards have seen many a\r\nglowing sunset; have stood against many high winds and rains; they have\r\nfor many years sheltered Aunt Hannah Irwin, ex-slave. Now the old Negro\r\nwoman is too old and feeble to venture very often from her small home.\r\nShe lives almost in solitude with her memories of the past, and an\r\noccasional visit from one of her old friends who perhaps brings her some\r\nfruit or a little money.\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm, I'll be pleased to tell you 'bout whut I remembers aroun' de\r\ntime of de War.\" Aunt Hannah sat stolidly in a chair that virtually\r\ngroaned under her weight; and gave utterance to this sentiment through a\r\nlarge thick mouth, while her gold ear rings shook with every turn of her\r\nhead, and her dim eyes glowed with memory's fires. \"Dere ain't much I\r\ncan tell you, dough,\" she went on, \"kaze I was only twelve years old\r\nwhen de war ended.\r\n\r\n\"I was bawn on Marse Bennett's plantation near Louisville, Alabama.

And dey beat some of 'em up scan'lous, but dey was pretty\r\ngood to me, I reckon.

I\r\nforgits his name but he was a tall nigger, married Dennis Coleman's\r\ndaughter. You 'members Dennis Coleman, had dat gal call Hettie? Well, he\r\nmarried Hettie, and he whooped her up mightily.

Unlike\r\nmost of the former slaves, he never worked hard. His hours were too\r\nfilled with the joy of playing, for he belonged to a little crippled boy\r\nabout his own age and guarded over him all the time. At night the little\r\nwhite master and his small black playmate slept in the same room; the\r\nlatter having a pallet that he spread on the floor. During the day both\r\nlittle white and black played in the shade of the cedars on the grassy\r\nlawn. The kindly white owner of the plantation was always good to\r\nRandolph. Never a cross word was spoken to him, he says.\r\n\r\n\"But one day,\" Randolph said, \"de little massa took very sick. Dey\r\nwouldn't even let me see him. I had a feelin' trouble was a comin', kaze\r\nlittle massa neber did have no real life like other boys. He was always\r\na lookin' lak a sick puppy. I gues de Lawd jus' wanted him fo' hisself,\r\nand he took him.\r\n\r\n\"Adder dat I was put to work on a mule dat turned de wheel of de cotton\r\ngin. He jus' walk aroun' in circles lak de mule dat's pullin' a syrup\r\npress. Den de War came, and all de good clothes dat we had made on de\r\nloom turned to tatters. De food got low; some of de slaves run away and\r\nsome of our houses was burned by de Yankees. Atter de war, de massa came\r\nback and told us niggers dat we waunt slaves no mo'. Said we could go,\r\nbut if we wanted to stay we could do dat too. He gib' each fambly dat\r\nstayed a mule, a cow, some tools and money enough to run 'em till dey\r\ncould git de crop harvested. He was de best massa dat any nigger ever\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n\"Den I come to Bummin'ham. I worked on de railroad dey was puttin'\r\nthrough. I was a big nigger and I could make de others step. I was about\r\nsix feet three inches and weighed near 200 pounds. I knowed my ole massa\r\nwould have been proud of me if he coulda seed me a-workin' on de\r\nrailroad and a liftn' dem ties and a sweatin' wid dem rails; I wished I\r\ncoulda been in his cotton field and a-heard him talkin' fair like instid\r\nob listenin' to dat foreman gibin' us de debil 'bout bein' lazy when we\r\nwas a workin' our selfs nearly to death. Den one day I saw de foreman\r\nslap a nigger fo' drinkin' at de dipper too long. De nigger picked up a\r\nshovel and slam him in de haid, and run. Back in de slabery days dey\r\ndidn't do somethin' and run. Dey run befo' dey did it, kaze dey knew dat\r\nif dey struck a white man dere want goin' to be no nigger. In dem days\r\ndey run to keep from doin' somethin'! Nowadays dey do it and den dey\r\nruns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Jones\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Abraham Jones*\r\n    --_G.L. Clark_\r\n\r\n_THE PATRIARCH ABRAHAM SAW THE STARS FALL_\r\n\r\nA lot of water passes under the bridge in 112 years. I thought of that\r\nas I talked to Abraham Jones, 112-year-old ex-slave of Village Springs,\r\nAlabama. \"Uncle Abe\" says he was born August 1, 1825, in Russell County,\r\nAlabama. Perhaps the day, the month and the year may not be exactly\r\naccurate. But they are near enough. He recalls the falling of the stars,\r\nthe removal of the Indians from Russell County and the settlement of\r\nAuburn and other towns in that section. His great age is not apparent in\r\nhis looks, actions or natural faculties. His hair is thin and white, but\r\nno more so than that of many men half his age, and his hearing is good.\r\nThe mellow voice so characteristic of his race, is strong. He stands as\r\nstraight as a soldier. And he works regularly to earn a living for his\r\nfamily. When we found him he was laying a flagstone walk in hard clay\r\nsoil, and there was power in the swing of his pick and his tamping ax.\r\nHis regular daily chores include milking a cow and chopping wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Abraham Jones, Village Springs, Alabama_]\r\n\r\nHe describes the phenomenon of falling stars as an event that occurred\r\nwhen he was \"a little shaver 'bout eight year' old.\" November 13, 1833\r\nwas the date.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I saw de stars fall. Some folks say dey didn't never fall but\r\nI seen 'em. Dey fell jest like pitch from a torch, 'Z-z-z-z-zip,\r\nz-z-z-z-zip!' and big cracks come in de ground. I was settin' on de end\r\nof de porch, and I watched 'em. Dere was so many grown people crowdin'\r\ninto de house, 'twa'n't no use fer me to try to git in so I jest sot\r\nstill. We had a big sill under our house, more dan a foot thick, and so\r\nmany people crowded in de house till dere weight broke de sill. Dey was\r\ncryin' and hollerin' but de stars didn't hurt nobody; dey jest fell and\r\nwent out, and I don't know where dey went den; maybe into dem cracks in\r\nde ground. De cracks stayed a long time and it was dangerous for de\r\npeople to go about at night; dey might fall into de cracks. One of dem I\r\nremember was two feet across and so deep dey couldn't find no bottom wid\r\na long pole. I reckon dem stars kept fallin' for about a hour. Folks\r\nthought de end of time was comin' and ever'body got right after dat.\r\n\r\n\"Back at dat time de country was not settled much and dere was lots of\r\nIndians. My grandpappy was a full-blooded Indian but I don't know what\r\nkind. De Indians was good people but if dey thought you had done 'em\r\nwrong dey'd kill you right now. I saw some of dem when dey left dat\r\ncountry. Dey women carried de babies in some sort of sacks, hung down in\r\nfront of 'em, and de men carried some of de bigger chillun on dey\r\nshoulders. Dey didn't have no property--jest lived wild in de woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Abraham Jones' Back Yard, Village Springs, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"A few years after de stars fell, a passel of people from de other side\r\nof Columbus, Georgia, moved over and started de town of Auburn so dey\r\ncould have a place for a school.\r\n\r\n\"Before de war my people took me up to Blount County, and when de war\r\ncome dey left me to run de grist-mill. I was de fust man in Alabama to\r\ntry to grind a bushel of oats. I ground 'em too. A lady brung de oats\r\nand ast me could I grind 'em, and I told her I would try. She say dey\r\ndidn't had nothin' for de chillun to eat. I ground de oats, and told\r\nher, 'Ole Mistis, I knows jest how 'tis and I'll be glad to give you a\r\npeck of meal if you will use it.' She say, 'of course I will; jest put\r\nit in with the oat meal, and I sure will appreciate it.' Her husband was\r\noff to de war and she didn't had no way to feed de chillun.\r\n\r\n\"I was workin' on de road a long time after de war and was tellin' de\r\nmen about dat when her son hear me. She had told him about it and so he\r\nwent home and told her he had found me. She sent word back for me to go\r\nto her house and let her see if I shore 'nuff was de same man. So I went\r\nand when she seen me she say, 'Yes, he is the same man,' and she called\r\nher husband and de other chillun and told 'em about it. Her husband say,\r\n'Well, dey is jest one thing we kin do. If he ever need a place to stay\r\nor vittles to eat, we must see dat he gits dem.'\r\n\r\n\"In slavery time I belong to Massa Frank Jones, and Timothy Jones was de\r\noverseer on de place. Frank Jones had two plantations, de one whar I was\r\nborn and another one close to Columbus. People ax me sometimes what kind\r\nof house I was born in and I tell 'em I wa'n't born in no house; and I\r\nwarn't, I was born in de middle of de big road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Abraham Jones' House, Village Springs, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"It's gittin' to where it's mighty hard for me to go now and do de work\r\nto make sompen for us to eat. I can't git about so fast and my head\r\nbother me a lot. I been workin' a long time now, and you does git tired\r\nafter a hundred years of workin'!\"\r\n\r\nOn his wrists were circlets of heavy cord. I asked him why they were\r\nthere and he explained:\r\n\r\n\"To keep de pain out. Dey keeps it out purty good but if you can git a\r\nlittle leather band wid a buckle on it, dat is better yet.

Sometimes us could go off to church, an' I remembers a\r\nbabtizin' in de creek.

Her\r\noldest grandson was sick in the next room with pneumonia; the cabin was\r\nstuffy and bare.\r\n\r\nLucindy said:\r\n\r\n\"Honey, I was borned in Macon, Georgy, on de twenty-eighth day of some\r\nmonth or other; I can't 'member which.

The first was\r\nduring the month of April, 1937; the next was nearly a month later. On\r\nthe first trip I had a very successful talk with the old Negro woman,\r\nbut on the last, she wasn't at home, and so the information I sought had\r\nto wait. I was very disappointed that I couldn't see her on my second\r\nventure, but it was impossible.\r\n\r\nMammy Lucy had not grown very feeble when I last saw her, and her\r\nmethodical mode of living can be attributed to her consciousness of the\r\nvenerable age of eighty-five years which she had reached. She was born\r\ninto slavery in 1851 at Swift's Landing near the town of Blakeley, in\r\nBaldwin County. She was a slave in the Charles Hall family of that\r\ncounty before and during the War between the States. In 1907, she came\r\nto work for the T.S. Fry and Santos Rubira families of Mobile.\r\n\r\nFollowing the War between the States, Mammy Lucy Kimball worked in\r\nvarious families at the summer resorts of Baldwin County.\r\n\r\nWhen a young girl, Mammy Lucy performed the duties of a children's\r\nnurse, and worked as a dining room servant. She had some education, and\r\nas she had worked in families of refinement and culture all her life,\r\nher manner was that of a well educated person. However, like the average\r\neducated Negro, she still displayed the characteristics of the Negro of\r\nthe ante-bellum days. She said that she strictly adhered to old\r\nfashioned methods, such as: going to church twice a week, not believing\r\nin doctors, and always taking home-concocted remedies.\r\n\r\nI asked her if she believed in carrying a rabbit's foot for luck, to\r\nwhich she responded:\r\n\r\n\"Honey, you don' think I'm like these other Negroes, who still believe\r\nin that old nonsense? I might tell the children that a rabbit foot\r\nbrings good luck because it is an old custom for superstitions persons\r\nto carry one, but, honey, you'd have just as good luck if you carried\r\nbrick-bats in your coat. My white people in Baldwin County never brought\r\nme up to believe in such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mammy Lucy,\" I asked, \"do you remember any strange or weird\r\nthings that happened during the Civil War?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered slowly, \"I remember during the Civil War some of the\r\nmischievous Sibley boys who were kin to the Hall family over in Baldwin\r\nCounty, tied a strange long black thread to the ankle of a black boy\r\nnamed Slow Poke.\r\n\r\n\"Some Negroes were going to town that night to fetch supplies and among\r\nthem was Slow Poke. The boys jokingly asked him if he had his rabbit\r\nfoot with him as he might need it to keep the rattling noises away at\r\nnight. Slow Poke showed them his rabbit foot and, displaying his\r\nglistening teeth in a broad grin he said that there 'warn't goin' to be\r\nno ghosties atter him.' The boys deftly tied a string to Slow Poke's\r\nankle while some of their friends held his attention. On this string\r\nwere attached three cow bladders. Slow Poke hadn't gone far when he\r\nheard the bladders rattling at his heels. He immediately decided that\r\nthere was a whole troop of ghosts after him, and so began to hit his\r\nfastest gait down the middle of the dark road. He ran till he reached\r\nMontgomery Hill some miles distant, where the string finally wore out.\r\nHis people didn't find him till three days later. Then they took him\r\nhome and gave him a sound whipping for running away.\"\r\n\r\nMammy Lucy talked of the Hall and Sibley families and of the wealth that\r\nthey once had, and what happiness she found in being slave to such good\r\npeople. She remembered all the summer resorts on the eastern shore of\r\nMobile Bay when they were in their glory before the Civil War, and how\r\nthe Mobile ferries landed bringing over all the fashionable Mobile\r\nfamilies to their summer homes on the bay. She remembered hearing father\r\nRyan, the poet-priest of the south, preaching at the dedication of the\r\nCatholic Church at Montrose and the storm in the '70's which almost\r\ndemolished Alabama City (now Fairhope). She recalls the landing of the\r\nConfederate troops at Hollywood for wood when they left Mobile at the\r\noutbreak of the war on their way to Fort Pickens, Florida, to enter\r\nactive service.\r\n\r\nI found Mammy Lucy to be neat and prim as she must have been thirty\r\nyears ago, when she first went to work for the Fry and Rubira families.\r\nShe still walks with the agility of a young person, and her mind is\r\nfertile with fresh thoughts and with the deeds of the past. \"I have\r\nfound happiness,\" she said. \"People have been good to me and I, in\r\nreturn, have tried to be kind to those around me. I have lived a plain\r\nlife and have been rewarded with a ripe age that still finds me feeling\r\nyoung. I shall never grow old in my thoughts and actions, but always\r\nkeep a place in my mind to welcome something new. I will have had a\r\ncomplete life if I can live only two weeks longer. There is something\r\nI'd like to see.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few more minutes I left her and returned home. There was\r\nsomething I wanted to ask Mammy Lucy; something that preyed on my mind\r\nfor days. I wanted to ask her what the thing was that she wanted to see.\r\nShe was so gentle and courteous; my interest seemed officious prying\r\ninto her affairs. Someday I shall go to see her again, I decided, and\r\nbring up the subject casually. Then she'll never know of my unworthy\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later I walked to the door of Mammy Lucy's cabin and on the\r\nporch stood a Negro girl watering a few pots of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Is Mammy Lucy at home?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe girl was silent for a moment, then she spoke in a high-pitched\r\nwhining voice: \"Mammy Lucy, she died.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry,\" I said. \"When did she die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fo' days ago,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nI walked down the path of pebbles toward the bay. The question would\r\nnever be answered, but I knew that Mammy Lucy died content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEllen King\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Personal conversation with Aunt Ellen King*\r\n    *Mauvilla, Alabama*\r\n    --_Mary A. Poole, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_SATAN DONE GOT DIS JUKING GENERATION_\r\n\r\nEllen King lives in a two room cabin nestling back in the woods near\r\nMauvilla, Ala., about twelve miles above Mobile. A little Negro boy led\r\nme along a circuitous path to the ex-slave, showing the weight of her 86\r\nyears. After talking awhile she became interested and told that she was\r\nborn at Enterprise, Miss. on the plantation of Mr. and Mrs. Harvey, but\r\ncould not recall their given names, or the names of their children, of\r\nwhich there were three, two girls and one boy.\r\n\r\nThey lived in a big white house and the cabins in the slave quarters\r\nwere built of planks, with streets between and little gardens in front\r\nof them. Some planted vegetables and others flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Harveys were good masters, they had plenty to eat, and good homespun\r\nclothes to wear and home-tanned leather shoes. The women gathered\r\nleaves, bark, and indigo to dye the cloth to make their dresses of\r\ndifferent colors.\r\n\r\nThe plantation was large and had several slaves. Aunt Ellen, however,\r\ncould not recall the number of acres or the number of slaves, but knew\r\nthere was a crowd of them. The Harvey's raised wheat, cotton and corn,\r\nand lots of live stock.\r\n\r\nAunt Ellen sat quiet for a few moments and said:\r\n\r\n\"Lady, when I sits and thinks of all the good things us had to eat and\r\nall the fun we had 'course we had to work, but you knows lady, when a\r\ncrowd all works together and sings and laughs, first thing you knows\r\nwork's done.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Ellen recalled the Yankees coming through and telling all the\r\nslaves they were free, and that a lot of the slaves went with them, but\r\nAunt Ellen laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\"My Pa and some of the others got scared and hid in a big cave and just\r\nstayed there until the soldiers left, and, lady, he still stayed on\r\natter the war with the Harveys, and I was married there in the white\r\nfolks church. They gave me a big wedding, lots to eat, plenty of music,\r\nsinging and dancing. Jest like they used to say, we 'danced all night to\r\nbroad daylight.'\"\r\n\r\nAunt Ellen was asked how many times she was married and she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Twice, first one dead and don't know where t'other is, and had no\r\nchildren by either.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about religion Aunt Ellen said:\r\n\r\n\"Lady, I prayed and prayed and religion came to me, and I jined the Big\r\nZion Methodist Church, in Mobile, Ala., but moved here to Mauvilla where\r\nthere was no Methodist Church, so I jined the Baptist Church.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Ellen says the people of today are going back not forward. \"All\r\nthey study is idleness and to do devilment these days. Young generation\r\ndone gone, Satan got 'am, too much 'juking' these days, have no time to\r\nstudy 'bout the Lord and their dying day. All they do, is juke, juke,\r\njuke! When they closed the schools up here in Mauvilla, they had\r\nchildren all juking.\r\n\r\nThe writer was somewhat at a loss to know just what Aunt Ellen meant by\r\n\"juking,\" but thought best to let her talk on and not make a direct\r\ninquiry, and after a little Aunt Ellen continued:\r\n\r\n\"No, lady, we used to call figgers for our dancing, had a big fiddle and\r\ntwo small fiddles, and a set in one room and one in t'other. None of\r\nthis twisting and turning. I just can't stand all that juking, just\r\nwon't look at it.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"juking\" Aunt Ellen meant rough dancing of the generation of today.\r\n\r\nAunt Ellen firmly believes the old-time religion was best for all, and\r\ntried to sing in a wavering voice the following:\r\n\r\n    \"Down by the river side,\r\n    Jesus will talk and walk,\r\n    Ain't going to study the world no more,\r\n    Ain't going to study the world no more,\r\n    For down by the river side,\r\n    Jesus will talk and walk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandy Leslie\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Mandy Leslie*\r\n    --_Daphne L.E. Curtis, Fairhope, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_THE ORPHAN SLAVE-GIRL_\r\n\r\nIn the suburbs of Fairhope, in a rough but neatly-kept cottage of two\r\nrooms, lives Mandy Leslie, a hard-working Negro woman whose energy\r\nbelies the seventy-seven years to which she credibly lays claim. Twice\r\nwidowed and her children scattered to the winds, Mandy is a pillar of\r\nstrength and comfort to several white households, where she makes weekly\r\ncalls to care for the laundry work, \"wash and iron,\" as she calls it.\r\nThe washing is done in the back yards, where a hot fire under an iron\r\npot boils the garments to a state that permits Mandy's rubbing over a\r\nfluted wash-board to make them spotless. Strung on lines in the sun, the\r\nclothes are ready for ironing next day.\r\n\r\nUsing old-fashioned sadirons, heated at an open fire, Mandy turns out a\r\n\"done-up\" product that any modern laundry might envy. During the ironing\r\nprocess, which takes place in the hall or a spare room, the mistress of\r\nthe house is entertained with a steady stream of biography, comment, and\r\ninformation from the lonely old woman who relishes this opportunity to\r\ntalk to somebody, especially if there happens to be a visitor who is not\r\nfamiliar with her story. A typical episode runs like this:\r\n\r\n\"Yassum, I 'members de war, but I don't lak no wars. Dey give folks\r\ntrouble and dey's full of evil doings. When de Yankees come t'rough\r\nhere, dey took my mammy off in a wagon, and lef' me right side de road,\r\nand when she try to git out de wagon to fetch me, dey hit her on de head\r\nand she fell back in de wagon and didn't holler no more. Dey jes' driv'\r\noff up de big road wid Mammy lying down in de wagon--she mount a been\r\ndead, 'cause I ain't never seed her no mo'.\r\n\r\n\"Unker John Leslie and Aunt Josie and all dey chillun come along in a\r\nwagon, gwine up North, dey said, and dey said dey found me standing dar\r\nside de road crying for my mammy. Aunt Josie, she say: 'Pore little\r\nlamb, you gwine wid us. Us ain't got much, but us can't let you die.'\r\nAnd Unker John, he say: 'Poor chile, us mustn't leave her disaway.' He\r\nlift me up in de wagon and drive twell de mule gin plum' out, and den us\r\nstop and took up on a place not fur from Mon'gomery, on Mr. Willis\r\nBiles' place. Us live dar twell I was grown woman, and Mr. Biles sho'\r\nwas a good man to live wid and he treat us right every year.\r\n\r\n\"Den I married Taylor and us kep' on living wid Mr. Biles and all t'ree\r\nof us's chillun was borned dere. Den Taylor died wid de fever, and he\r\nhad insho'ance whet us pay a dollar a mont' for de longest and he say it\r\ntake care me and de chillun when he gone. Bless God, dat money didn't\r\ntake care nobody 'cept de doctor and de burying-man. Dey bofe got dey\r\npart and lef' me jes' two dollar and seventy cents, dat's all. Mr. Biles\r\nsay dey ought to be whupped for chargin' me lak dey did. Den he went to\r\nsee 'em, and cussed 'em out, and dey sont back twenty dollar. I ain't\r\nwaste no more money on insho'ance, no ma'am!\r\n\r\n\"I had a hard time keeping my chillun and working de crop too; but Mr.\r\nBiles, he 'low me a mule, jes' lak he do Taylor 'fore he died, and us\r\nmade four bags of cotton de fust year and five bags de nex' year. I pick\r\nevery lock of it myself--jes' me and dem little chilluns.\r\n\r\n\"Den Rufus he come along and he thought us had all de insho'ance money,\r\nand he court me so hard and so reg'lar dat I act a fool and married him,\r\nand he turn out to be de no-countest nigger dat ever lived. 'Stead of\r\nhim supporting me, us had to support him for nigh 'bout ten year, me and\r\nde chillun. He had misery in he back, and couldn't do no hard work lak\r\nplowing and hoeing. It hurt he back to pick cotton and pull fodder, and\r\nhe jes' set 'roun' and make a few baskets and eat lak a hoss.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Willis Biles he died, and he boy, Mr. Joe, he took de place and run\r\nit for he ma. Mr. Joe told Rufus 'twan't nothing de matter wid him but\r\ndamn lazy, and if he don't git out and he'p me work, he gonna set de Ku\r\nKlux on him. Den us got scared and moved nigh 'bout to Uniontown, and us\r\nlive wid Mr. Bob Simmons for seben years hand-running, and he treat us\r\nright every fall 'bout de settlement. Mr. Bob he say 'tain't nothing de\r\nmatter wid Rufus jes' lak Mr. Joe say, and Rufus say he gwine move to\r\ntown whar he kin git work to suit him.\r\n\r\n\"Us move to town, and Rufus he gone all day looking for a job and don't\r\nfind nothing to suit him. I has to take in washing from de white folks\r\nto feed us and dey charge two dollars rent for de little shack us live\r\nin. 'Twan't right to do dat; 'cause I ain't never paid no house-rent in\r\nall my bo'n days, twell den. And de fust t'ing I know, dat trifling\r\nRufus he done sell de mule and wagon and got drunk and lost de res' of\r\nde money. Us was sho' in a bad fix. Why didn't I quit Rufus?

He keppa callin' de Mistis\r\nhis mammy, but he neber open his eyes to see dat she warn't his mammy.\r\nHe died a little later wid a conjested chill.\r\n\r\n\"Den I remembers one of de Alabama River floods, dat swep' ober de lan'\r\nan' washed away lots of de food. De gover'ment sont some supplies of\r\nmeat, meal an' 'lasses. De barrels was marked U.S. an' one nigger, bein'\r\ntired of waitin' an' bein' powerful hongry tol' us dat de U.S. on de\r\nbarrel meant Us, so us commence' to eat. When de oberseer come to gib us\r\nde meat an' 'lasses, us be done et it all up.\r\n\r\n\"Us slaves useta git up at dawn; de oberseer blowed a cow hawn to call\r\nus to work. De Hunter slaves was 'lowed to go avisitin' udder slaves\r\natter work hours an' on Sundays, an' iffen we was to meet a pattyroller,\r\nan' he axe us whar we f'um an' who we b'long to all us had to say was\r\nwe's Hunter niggers; an' dat pattyroller didn't do nothin', caze de\r\nHunter niggers warn't neber whupped by no pattyroller. Some niggers when\r\ndey was kotched eben dough dey warn't Hunter niggers, dey'd say it jus'\r\nde same, caze dem pattyrollers was always 'fraid to fool 'long wid a\r\nHunter nigger. Massa Hunter, he was somp'n'.\r\n\r\n\"Durin' de Christmas celebration, us all had gif's. Us had quilting\r\nbee's wid de white folks, an' iffen a white gent'man th'owed a quilt\r\nober a white lady he was 'titled to a kiss an' a hug f'um her. Atter de\r\ncelebratin' we all had a big supper.\r\n\r\n\"An' speakin' of cures, white folks, us niggers had 'em. My grandmammy\r\nwas a midwife an' she useta gib women cloves an' whiskey to ease de\r\npain. She also gib 'em dried watermelon seeds to git rid of de grabel in\r\nde kidneys. For night sweats Grandmammy would put an axe under de bed of\r\nde sick pusson wid de blade asittin' straight up. An' iffen yo' is sick\r\nan' wants to keep de visitors away, jus' putt a fresh laid aig in front\r\nof de do' an' dey won't come in. If you is anxious fo' yo' sweetheart to\r\ncome back f'um a trip put a pin in de groun' wid de point up an' den put\r\na aig on de point. When all de insides runs outen de aig yo' sweetheart\r\nwill return.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, white folks, us useta hab games. Us useta play, 'Puss in de\r\ncawner,' 'Next do' neighbor' an' 'Fox an' geese.' I kin gib you some of\r\nde songs we useta sing:\r\n\r\n    Old sweet beans and barley grows,\r\n      Old sweet beans an' barley grows,\r\n    You nor I nor nobody knows,\r\n      Where old sweet beans an' barley grows.\r\n\r\n    Go choose yo' east,\r\n      Go choose yo' wes',\r\n    Go choose de one dat you love best,\r\n      If she's not here to take her part,\r\n    Choose de nex' one to yo' heart.\r\n\r\n\"I is always been a 'piscopalian in belief, white folks. I ma'ied Bill\r\nLewis when I was fifteen year old in Montgomery an' us had three\r\nchilluns. I is strong in my faith.\r\n\r\n    In mercy, not in wrath,\r\n      Rebuke me, gracious Lawd\r\n    Les' when Dy whole displeasure rise,\r\n      I sink beneath Dy rod.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, I remembers de war. I seed de Yankees a-marchin' through our\r\nplace an' down de road dat led to Portland in Dallas County. Dey was\r\nmighty fine looking wid all dere brass buttons and nice lookin'\r\nuniforms. Dey didn't gib us much trouble. Dey had a Cap'n dat was good\r\nan' kin'. I heered him say dat dere warn't agoin' to be no stealin' an'\r\natrampin' through folks' houses. Dey slep' outen de yard for one night;\r\nden dey went on in to Portland.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Munger was our oberseer, but he had money of his own.

I remembers sittin' in de doctor's lap while he\r\ntried to soothe my ailments.\r\n\r\n\"Us house servants was taught to read by de white folks, but my\r\ngran'-mammy, Alvain Hunter, dat didn't have no learnin' but dat knowed\r\nde Bible back'ards an' farwards, made us study. When me an' my brother\r\nwas learnin' outen de Blue Back Speller she say:\r\n\r\n\"'How's dat? Go ober it.'\r\n\r\n\"Den we would laugh an' answer, 'How you know?

Born into slavery, he was the\r\nproperty of one Joel Matthews, cotton planter, whose fields lay near the\r\nthen new capital city.\r\n\r\nLightnin' is happiest when spinning some yarn of the old days in Alabama\r\nfor an interested audience, and when one such inquired as to how he came\r\nto be called \"Lightnin',\" the old man broke into a toothless grin and\r\nlaunched at once into another of the stories dear to his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Dat's Massa Joel's doin's, boss. I jist natcherly wa'nt neber any too\r\npeart an fas' on my foots, an de fus' thing Massa Joel eber sot me to\r\nfetch him was a cool drink o' water.

Diard, [HW: Mobile?]_\r\n\r\n_HE CANED A CHAIR FOR PRESIDENT BUCHANNAN_\r\n\r\nOn a bright April afternoon, while strolling along the Louisville and\r\nNashville banana wharf and watching the crisp breezes from the gulf make\r\nsmall waves lick at the pilings, I met an old Negro man who was fishing\r\nfor croakers off the pier. He had, sitting beside him, a basket\r\ncontaining wicker canes for making and repairing chairs. In the course\r\nof our conversation, I asked him his age.\r\n\r\n\"I'se eighty year old, white folks,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"you must have been a slave back in the days before the\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, boss. I were eight year old when Gen'l Grant freed de niggers.\"\r\nHe spoke the words in a clear, strong voice and with a slight rolling\r\nmotion of his gray bristly head.\r\n\r\n\"But General Grant didn't free the slaves, Uncle,\" I protested.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yassuh he did too, white folks,\" he said respectfully; fo' I was\r\nright dere when de gen'l come into Richmond and sot us free.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Abraham Lincoln?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess he done a part of it, but he didn't do no fightin', kaze\r\nhe hadda 'tend to de business in de White House. He lef' de freein' part\r\nto Gen'l Grant. I don' guess Mr. Abe lived long enough ter help us\r\nniggers much. He went to de Ford's Circus and got hisse'f shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Billy Abraham Longslaughter. De niggers all calls me Billy, but ole\r\nMassa Longslaughter afore he died called me William.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you born, Uncle Billy?\"\r\n\r\n\"On ole Massa Longslaughter's plantation near Richmond Virginny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you read and write?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dey neber teach me no readin' and writin' kaze I had to work in de\r\nfields.\" His rusty hand rubbed across his woolly head, as my questions\r\ncontinued with the regularity of a metronome; nevertheless, Uncle Billy\r\nseemed always glad to answer them. I couldn't help but notice with what\r\nease he moved about. He had the agility of a man twenty years his\r\nJunior, though his face, being caverned with wrinkles, gave him the\r\nappearance of great age.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your home now, Uncle Billy?\" I continued.\r\n\r\n\"Most any place I goes, white folks. Ma wife, she died 'bout forty year\r\nago in Virginny, and I been a trabelin' eber since.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you do for a living besides fish?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I canes a few chairs,\" pointing to his basket of\r\nchair-canes beside him on the stringer of the wharf. \"You see, white\r\nfolks, when all dis repression came on an' dere war'n't no work fo' de\r\npeople tuh do, jes lak all de young scallawags I hops me a train and\r\ngoes on a trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you go next, Uncle Billy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I mought run ober to New Orleens if I can catch me a\r\nfreight train a goin' dat away.\"\r\n\r\n\"About your fixing chairs,\" I said. \"Have you ever repaired any for well\r\nknown people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor', white folks, I caned a chair oncet fo' President Buchanan and he\r\nused it ter sit on in de White House. I'se made many a chair fo' famous\r\npeople as I trabeled about. I guess I jus' keep on a goin' as long as\r\nI'se able, and when I goes on dat last trip across de quiet riber, I'se\r\ngoin' ter make one for ole Gabriel, so's he can res' hisself in between\r\ntimes he blows on dat hawn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with \"Uncle\" Louis*\r\n    --_David Holt, Mobile_\r\n\r\n_PSYCHOLOGY OF A RUNAWAY SLAVE_\r\n\r\nOf course you know that we always called the older colored men \"Uncle\"\r\nand the older colored women \"Aunt.\" It was proper manners.\r\n\r\nOld \"Uncle\" Louis was the oldest slave on the plantation, \"Uncle\" Toby\r\nhaving died. Louis was a \"Guinea nigger.\" His ancestors had been brought\r\nfrom the Guinea coast of Africa. He had the characteristic marks of his\r\ntribe, being short, strong and very black, with heavy neck, thick lips,\r\nflat nose and eyes like those of a hog. He had great knowledge of wild\r\nplants, claimed to understand the language of birds and beasts. He\r\nprided himself on his powers as a hunter and also claimed intimate\r\nfriendship with ghosts and spooks. Being what was known as a \"yard\r\nservant,\" he had picked up much of the talk of his white masters and\r\nspoke his own version of their language.\r\n\r\nOld Louis was what was called a \"runaway nigger.\" He would run away in\r\nthe latter part of the summer once in every two or three years and come\r\nback in time to help dig sweet potatoes. I was out in the sweet potato\r\npatch one morning when he returned. The doctor was there, also. When\r\nLouis walked up he simply said, \"Hello, Louis; are you well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes sir, Marster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take that basket and go to picking up potatoes.\" Not a word was\r\nsaid about his running away. After the hands had knocked off work and\r\nLouis was sitting in front of his cabin, I went to him for an interview.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Louis, what makes you run away? You don't get whipped or abused\r\nin any way.\"\r\n\r\nThe old slave scratched his grizzled head, puffed at his clay pipe and\r\npondered the subject for some time before he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Marse Davie, I does cause de woods seems to call me. When de fall\r\ninsec's is singin' in de grass an' the 'simmons is gettin' soft an' de\r\nleaves is beginnin' to turn, I jes natcherly has ter go. De wild sloes,\r\nde red haws an' de crab apples is ripe. De walnuts an de hickory nuts an\r\nde beach mast drappin' an de blue smoke comes over de woods, an de woods\r\nbirds an de yard birds goes souf wid de cranes an ducks an wil' geese an\r\nde blackbirds an de crows goes in droves--it seem lack all dat is jes\r\ncallin' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you go?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lorsy, Marse Davie, I never goes off de plantation. I always go to de\r\nwoods back o' de past'er. Ole Master knows whar I is an so does Henry.\r\nDon't you know dat holler dat come down on de lef' han' side of de\r\nbranch--de fus holler you comes to, not more dan two hundred yards in de\r\nwoods?\" I knew it well.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you 'member a big green oak tree growin' on de right han' side of\r\nde holler bout a hunder yard up de path?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, dat tree is my home. I done toted some poles an some sedge\r\ngress up dar an made me a bed--but you can't see it from de groun'. When\r\nI gets up dar I can see all 'roun'. I seen you an Marse Joe de las' time\r\nyou go fishin'. I lays dar all day and listen to de birds and critters\r\ntalkin'. A chicadee tole me you was comin' long befo' I seen you. Den a\r\njay bird caught a sight of you an he tole me. Can't nobody come along\r\nwidout de birds tellin' me. Dey pays no min' to a horse or a dog but\r\nwhen dey spies a man dey speaks. I done tame' a squi'l so he comes see\r\nme ever'day.\r\n\r\n\"De birds and critters sho is good comp'ny. I done made frens wid up all\r\nbut de owl and de hawk. Dey is jes natchally bad an de other critters\r\nhates 'em. A ole red-breast' hawk come an lit in a daid pine tree. I\r\nseen him so plain til I knowed what he was thinkin' about. He was jes\r\nmad clean down in his craw and was cussin' ever'thin'. A little pewee\r\nbird seen him an begin to fuss. A crow fly over and hear de pewee, den\r\nfly down close an take a good look at mister hawk den he fly up and\r\nstart callin' de other crows. In a little while a whole drove of crows\r\nis flyin' 'roun dat pine tree. Den de jay birds come an dey is callin'\r\nfor a fight, but de ole hawk never move. Den de mocking birds come an\r\ndey sair right in and starts pecking at de hawk until he dove into de\r\nwoods and gets away, an all de birds begin to talkin' 'bout bugs an\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was wound up for an interminable talk on his favorite theme,\r\nthe talk of critters, and to change the subject I asked: \"Uncle Louis,\r\nain't you afraid of ghosts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor', chile, I ain't feared of no ghos' or spook, as I's seed lots of\r\nboth. All a ghos' do is jes show hise'f. You never hear of one doin'\r\nnothin' to nobody. Dey is sociable an wants to be near livin' people.\r\nWhen folks gets scared it hurts de ha'nt's feelin's an dey goes\r\nsomewhere else. Dey has all de feelin's dey had when dey was livin'. You\r\nwouldn't stay by wid folks dat's fear'd of you an want to run away from\r\nwhere you is.\r\n\r\n\"Las' night, when I was up in my nes', an my fire had died out, all\r\n'sept one little chunk, an de moon was shinin' like day, I lay down, I\r\ndid, an I take a li'l nap o' sleep. Den I wakes up sudden an looks 'roun\r\nag'in. Well, sir, de norf side of de hill was covered wid ghoses an\r\nspooks; dey was layin' down, standin' up and leanin' agin trees, but\r\nmos'ly dey was jes sittin' on de groun', all lookin' at me hard as dey\r\ncould, widout battin' an eye.\r\n\r\n\"De neares' one to me was a little white ooman. She war sittin' flat on\r\nde groun', holdin' a baby in her lap. She look mighty pitiful an I say\r\n'please Missis, can I ho'p you an yo' baby? I'd be 'bleeged if you tell\r\nme.' Her lips move but I couldn't hear no sound. Den I lay me down an\r\ndrap off to sleep agin. When I wakes up de ghosses is all dere an de\r\nlittle white ooman look lak she want to say somethin', but can't, an I\r\nsay, 'I ain' nothin' but a poor runaway nigger, but my Marster is a\r\nmighty kin' man, he'll sholy he'p you; but she didn't say nothin' an I\r\ngoes back to sleep. De next time I wakes up de sun was risin' an I jes\r\nlays dere an watches de ghosses an spooks get thin, an fade away like a\r\nfog.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Negro was sitting in the twilight, talking in a low, impressive\r\nmonotone, in a language we both understood but which I find difficulty\r\nin transcribing after all these years that intervene. A screech owl was\r\n\"miseryflying\" in the family grave yard back of the quarters, a fitting\r\nabligato to the narrative. Though creepy sensations crawled up my spine,\r\nI still had my doubts.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Louis, do you really believe you saw all that, and didn't dream\r\nit while you were curled up in your nest?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe old man seemed aggrieved at my doubts as he replied:\r\n\r\n\"It ain't no beleevin' about it. I knows what I knows an I sees what I\r\nsees. De ghos' is what lives when de body is done wore out, but it don't\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all imagination,\" I said, in defense of reason and nature, as I\r\nunderstood these things.\r\n\r\n\"I wants to ax you what does de imaginin'. It's your ghos' that does the\r\nimagin' so you can see other ghosses an spooks.\"\r\n\r\nIn recognition of Louis' knowledge and powers of reasoning my brother\r\nWilliam wrote a diploma in Latin and presented it to him. After that he\r\nwas called \"Doctor\" Louis.\r\n\r\nI recall that it was about that time that I read a book on psychology\r\nbut later discovered that there were those on the plantation who had a\r\nbetter working knowledge of the subject than was taught in the book.\r\n\r\nBibliography: Old Plantation Days, an unpublished work by the Venerable\r\nDavid Elred Holt, late Archdeacon of the Sacramento Diocese (Protestant\r\nEpiscopal) of California, and a native of Buffalo Plantation, near\r\nNatchez, Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom McAlpin\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Tom McAlpin*\r\n    --_John Morgan Smith_\r\n\r\n_A WHUPPIN' WID DE TRIMMIN'S_\r\n\r\n\"Mornin' Boss,\" said uncle Tom McAlpin, \"how is you dis mornin'?\" The\r\nold former slave spoke cordially with a definite twinkle in his muddy\r\neyes though his age had passed the four score and ten mark. His mind was\r\nalert; his memory vivid, and his faculties of speech quite unusual. Tom\r\nMcAlpin was indeed a remarkable man. There was really a sincere note of\r\nwelcome in his voice as he came forward, placed a large piece of\r\ncast-iron pipe against the steps of his house, 1928 Ave. D. So.,\r\nBirmingham, and looked up at me showing a mouth of straggly teeth in a\r\nwarm smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh,\" he continued in his high-pitched voice after our salutations,\r\n\"I'll be glad to serve you as bes' I kin wid my knowledge of de pas'\r\nyears. Jus' you set down in dat chair,\" he pointed to what was left of\r\nan ante-bellum wicker seat; \"I'll set on dese steps an' us'll go over de\r\nwhole thing from de beginnin's.\r\n\r\n\"Fus' thing I guess you wants to know is whar an' when I was born.\r\nYassuh, an' who I b'long to. Well, Boss, I was born in Martersville,\r\nAlabamy. Dat's five miles southwest of Talladega. I come into dis ole\r\nworl' on a sunny day in June, eighteen fawty fo'. I belonged to Dr.\r\nAugustus McAlpin, an' from dat day to dis, I is seed many things come\r\nan' go, an' I is aimin' to see a lot mo' befo' I cross to de udder side.\r\n\r\n\"De docta jus' had a small plantation, 'bout 100 acres, I s'pose, an' he\r\ndidn't have but 12 slaves, 'caze dere warn't no need fo no mo'. He was\r\nbusy in town adoctorin' folks. He didn't have no time to do any real\r\nfarmin'.\r\n\r\n\"My job aroun' de place was to nuss de chilluns, white an' nigger. We\r\nall played 'roun' together. Sometimes we play coon an' rabbit, fox an'\r\nhoun' and snatch, but what was de mostes' fun was a-ridin' ole Sut. Sut\r\nwas a donkey an' us useta hitch him to a wagon, an' six of de chilluns\r\nwould ride in de wagon an' I'd ride on his back. Sometimes us'd ride all\r\nde way into Talladega wid Sut.\r\n\r\n\"Nawsuh, I ain't neber got no whuppin' but one, an' it was a sho' 'nough\r\ncomplete one, boss, wid all de trimmin's. It all happened when de Massa\r\ntold me he better not cotch dem hogs in de corn, an' iffen he did, I was\r\nagoin' to git a whuppin'. Well, boss, dere was one ole hog dat I jus'\r\ncouldn't keep outten dere so I tuk a needle an' sewed up his eyes.\r\n'Course I was jus' a little black 'un an' didn't know whut I was adoin',\r\nbut I sho' sewed up dat hog's eyelids so's he couldn't see nothin'. Dat\r\nkep' him outten de corn all raght, but when de Massa found it out he\r\ngave me a lickin' dat I ain't forgot yit. Boss, dat was de onlies'\r\nlesson I ever needed in my life. It done de wuk.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, dere was pattyrollers 'roun' our place, but dey never cotched\r\nme, 'caze I was too swif' for 'em. Boss, I could take holt of a hosses\r\ntail an' run 'roun' de pasture an' keep up wid him. I was sho' fas' on\r\nmy feets.\r\n\r\n\"Nawsuh, us wan't never given no money for nothin', but I learnt how to\r\nmake baskets an' I would take 'em in to Talladega on Sat'day evenings\r\nan' sell 'em to de white folks for fifteen cents. Den when I needed\r\nsomp'n lak 'bacca or a little piece of chocolate, I could go to de sto'\r\nan' buy it. Lots of slaves on yuther plantations warn't 'lowed to make\r\nany money dough.\r\n\r\n\"Nawsuh, I ain't never had no schoolin', 'ceptin' what I could git outen\r\nde little white folks' books myself. Us niggers useta tote dere books to\r\nschool for 'em an' on de way I would look in de book an' git a little\r\nlearnin'.\r\n\r\n\"When us niggers on de McAlpin place et, us et raght at de same table\r\ndat de white folks et at. Atter dey finished dere meal, us slaves would\r\nsit down raght atter dem an' eat de same kinda food. Yassuh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tom McAlpin, Birmingham, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Sho' I 'members de war. I 'members when de war commence', Jeff Davis\r\ncalled for volunteers; den a little later when de south needed mo' mens\r\nto fight, Jeff Davis' officers would go th'ough de streets, an' grab up\r\nde white mens an' put ropes 'roun' dere wrists lak dey was takin' 'em\r\noff to jail. An' all de while dey was jus' takin' 'em off to de war. Dey\r\nmade all de white mens go. It was called de 'scription. Some niggers\r\nwent too. Dem niggers fought raght side of dere masters. Some went as\r\nbody guards an' some went as soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, Boss, I recalls de time dat de 'federate soldiers, bless dere\r\nsouls, hid dere few hosses in de basement of de old Masonic Institute in\r\nTalladega an' hid dere amunition in de hollow stone pillars. Gen'l\r\nWilson an' his raiders come th'ough dar, but dey never did fin' dem\r\n'federate supplies. Dem Yankees jus' lak to scare eve'ybody roun' de\r\nplace to death. Dey shot up de town an' dem blue coats tuk eve'ything we\r\nhad: cotton, sugar, flour, hams, preserves, clothes, corn; eve'ything,\r\nBoss, eve'ything. Dey even burned up some houses.\r\n\r\n\"But Boss, dere ain't never been nobody afightin' lak our 'federates\r\ndone, but dey ain't never had a chance. Dere was jes' too many of dem\r\nblue coats for us to lick. I seen our 'federates go off laughin' an'\r\ngay; full of life an' health. Dey was big an' strong, asingin' Dixie an'\r\ndey jus knowed dey was agoin' to win. An' boss, I seen 'em come back\r\nskin an' bone, dere eyes all sad an' hollow, an dere clothes all ragged.\r\nBoss, dey was all lookin' sick. De sperrit dey lef' wid jus' been done\r\nwhupped outten dem, but it tuk dem Yankees a long time to do it. Our\r\n'federates was de bes' fightin' men dat ever were. Dere warn't nobody\r\nlak our 'federates.\r\n\r\n\"I was in Richmond dat cold day dat Gen'l Lee handed his sword over to\r\nde yuther side, an' I seen Jeff Davis when he made a speech 'bout\r\nstartin' over. I seen de niggers leavin' dere homes an' awandering' off\r\ninto de worl' to God knows whar, asayin' good-bye to dere white folks,\r\nan' atryin' to make dere way de bes' dey kin. But, white boss, it jes'\r\nseem lak you let a nigger go widout a boss an' he jes' no good. Dere\r\nain't much he kin do, 'caze dere ain't nobody to tell him. Yassuh, I was\r\nsont to Richmond to bring home some of our wounded 'federates. Dey sont\r\nme 'caze dey knowed I was agoin' to do my bes', an' caze dey knowed I\r\nwarn't afeered of nothin'. Dat's de way I've always tried to be, white\r\nboss, lak my white people what raised me.

She lives in a tiny cabin\r\nwith her youngest child, Zora, about eight miles from Opelika. She is\r\nvery feeble now and had to be wheeled out on the front porch to have her\r\npicture made.\r\n\r\nAnne lives exclusively in the past. To her, the present world is \"full\r\nof de devil an' gettin' worser every day.\" She likes to talk about the\r\nold days, but her voice is feeble and barely above a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I'se heerd a heap o' talk 'bout Mr. Abraham Lincoln,\" she said, \"an' I\r\nhad a picture of him onc't; but I don't know nothin' 'bout him.\"\r\n\r\nAnne takes her religion seriously and is devoutly confident that she\r\nwill \"inherit de promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I jined de church in Gold Hill, Alabama,\" she recalled, \"an' honey, I\r\nfelt so good I don't know jest how I did feel. I shouted three days an'\r\nwouldn't eat a bite. I couldn't even drink water.\"\r\n\r\nThe old former slave was born in Virginia in 1824 and belonged to John\r\nUmford. She was later sold to Bill Maddox, of Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"When I come from Virginny,\" she said, \"us travelled in wagons and slept\r\nin tents. Eve'y mornin' us was made to clean ourselves an' dress up; den\r\nus was put on de block an' bid on. White peoples was dere from\r\neverywhere; de face of de earth was covered by dem. I was thirteen den,\r\nan' I kin remember four wars.\r\n\r\n\"My mother and father was Charlie an' Rhody Heath, an' I had two\r\nbrothers an' two sisters. Our houses was lak horse stables; made of logs\r\nwid mud an' sticks dobbed in de cracks. Dey had no floors. Dere warn't\r\nno furniture 'cept a box fer de dresser wid a piece of looking glass to\r\nlook in. Us had to sleep on shuck mattresses an' us cooked on big\r\nfireplaces wid long hooks out over de fire to hang pots on to bile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anne Maddox, Opelika, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Us fried on three-legged skillets over de fire an' cooked ash-cakes on\r\nde hearth wid hickory leaves on de bottom nex' to de hearth. 'Tain't no\r\nsech good cookin' now as den.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout four o'clock in de evenin' all de little niggers was called up in\r\nde big yard where de cook had put milk in a long wooden trough an'\r\ncrumbled ash-cake in it. Us had pot licker in de trough, too. Us et de\r\nbread an' milk wid shells an' would use our hands, but it was good.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Marster hunted a heap, but us never did git none of what he brought\r\nin. Us had plenty of clothes, sich as was, but dey was spun an' wove at\r\nhome. Us had home-made shoes, hard brogans, called 'Jackson ties.' Dey\r\nhad brass caps on de toe an' would rub blisters on de feet.\r\n\r\n\"De plantation had several hundred acres. I was up wid de fust light to\r\ndraw water and help as house girl. When dat task was done I had to go to\r\nde fiel'. Dey blew a big hawn to 'rouse de slaves in de morning's,\r\nsometimes 'fore day.\r\n\r\n\"Marster was good to us niggers, dough. He never 'lowed us to be\r\nwhupped; jist scolded us. If us went anywheres, us had to be back by\r\nsundown. I once seed some slaves workin' roads in chains wid a iron ball\r\nhangin' on behin'. It was punishment fur meanness.\"\r\n\r\nAnne said the slaves on the Maddox plantation were never allowed to\r\nlearn to read and write, declaring: \"It was too bad if dey kotched a\r\nnigger wid a pencil an' paper in his han!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was made to carry Marster's chilluns to school, den go back fur 'em,\"\r\nshe said. \"Ol' Mistus read us de Bible, an' us went to de white folks\r\nchurch an' sat in de back, wid de white peoples sittin' up front.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dem patterollers was bad. I sho' would run from dem things, too.\"\r\n\r\nAnne's mind leaps in fast succession from one subject to another, and at\r\ntimes it is difficult to keep up with her intermingled thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Marster give us plenty of licker,\" she said, \"an' us laked dat. One\r\nof de funniest things us had aroun' de plantation was a little goat dat\r\ncould walk a fence jist lak us little niggers.\r\n\r\n\"When de Yankees come, gran'daddy was at prayer meetin' an' Ol' Marster\r\ncome runnin' an' told de niggers to hitch up de mules an' waggins. Dey\r\nwas tol' to hide all de food an' jewelry, but 'bout dat time us seed de\r\nYankees comin'. Dey didn't do us no harm; sho' did some places, dough.\r\n\r\n\"T'want long 'fore Marster call all us niggers up to de house an' tol'\r\nus dat us was free. He said us could go away or stay wid him. I stayed\r\n'twel I was grown an' married Doc Maddox. Us had five chillun, Walter,\r\nFailer, Siney, Zora an' Johnny.

His mother and father were Susan and\r\nMonroe Menefee. They had six other children, Patsy, Sally, Lula, Mary,\r\nMelvina, and Philmore. Susan Menefee came from Jefferson County and\r\nMonroe from Gold Hill, Alabama, and belonged to Willis Menefee, near\r\nRoberson's Mill.\r\n\r\n\"My mother's father an' mother was Milton and Patsy Footman whut come\r\nfrum Meridian, Miss., and dey paid $3500 for dem,\" Frank boasts.\r\n\r\n\"I'se never seed inside a jail, never paid a nickel in council, ain't\r\nnever gwine to steal nothin' whut don't belong to me an' ain't never\r\nused a cuss word in my life. I always tried to do whut was right an' I\r\nplowed ever' day us could. Us cooked on dem great big fireplaces, 'bout\r\nsix feet wide an' two an' three feet deep, with pots an' kittles hangin'\r\nout over hickory an' oak fires. Nobody better not spit in dat fireplace\r\nneither. Sho' never was better eatin' collards dan dem. All the chillun\r\nhad a tin plate an' a tin cup with buttermilk in hit.\r\n\r\n\"I was whut dey called a shirt-tail fellow, had long shirt dresses of\r\nosnaburg dyed with red mud an' cinnamon bark. In winter dey doubled de\r\nosnaburg to be warmer. My daddy was a shoemaker. He made dem outer\r\ncowhides an' even lef' de hair on dem sometimes. Yuther times he clean\r\n'em in de wash-pot to git de hair offen 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Us had good Marsa and Mistiss, iffen you wukked an' 'haved yourse'f.\r\nDey was marsa Willis an' Miss Hanna Menefee. Dey jes' had two chillun\r\nWillis an' Willie. Willie weighed two hundred pounds when he was very\r\nyoung too. De 'Big House' stood in a oak grove wid one big oak tree\r\nraght by it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sadler, de overseer, was good, too, but you sho' had to wuk. He's\r\ngot a great-great-grandson, Sam Sadler, living now in Waverly, Alabama.\r\nDe poor white peoples 'roun' dere used to ho'p us wuk. I disremembers\r\nour carriage driver's name but us had one dat drove Mistiss about, an'\r\nde carriage house was close to de Big House.\r\n\r\n\"Marsa had seven or eight hundred acres in de plantation an' I jes'\r\ndon't know de number of slaves he did have. Dey got us up by daylight\r\nan' 'fo'. Blowed a cockle shell to get us niggers up. Iffen you didn't\r\nwuk, dey 'tended to you. Dey slashed one nigger an' he died nex' week.\r\nUs plowed 'twell dark an' lots an' lots of times all night long wid a\r\nlantern tied to front an' back of de plows. We was picking cotton all\r\nnight long too, be ready to take dat wagon to de gin by three or four\r\no'clock in de morning. Sometimes dey would put de slaves in chains. When\r\ndey wuk clearing up new groun' dey had chains put 'roun' dey ankles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Frank Menefee, Opelika, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday mornin' Mistiss would try to teach us niggers de Bible. Den\r\nus would go to church at white church an' sit in de back wid white folks\r\nin front. De preacher was Rev'ren Frank Hugely. Dat Sunday mornin'\r\nbreakfast sho' was good to us niggers. Us had meat, sugar, lard an'\r\nbutter. I used to love to hear dem sing. When My Soul Be Resting in de\r\nPresence of My Lord, I'll Be Satisfied. I was baptized at eleven o'clock\r\nby Dave Hill an' I sho' got happy. I shouted an' sung: 'I'se never drunk\r\nno whiskey in my life.' When any of de niggers would pass on, old\r\nMistiss would stand over de casket and weep. Us would pull off our hats\r\nan' marsa was nice as he could be, too. Hit was a home-made box dyed\r\nblack. Mistiss she would see to de fixin' of de shroud.\r\n\r\n\"De patrollers sho' would get you an' dat's one thing made you stick to\r\nyour wuk.\r\n\r\n\"On Sadday nights us would frolic an' dance all night long iffen you\r\nwanted to, buck-dance, sixteen-hand reel and cake walk. Dey would blow\r\nreed quills an' have all the licker dey wanted. Mistiss, dey ain't jes'\r\nnow drinkin' licker. Oh, dem cornshuckings! Shuk corn, drink an' holler\r\nall night long. Sometimes dey'd sing:\r\n\r\n    Dark cloud arising like gwine to rain,\r\n      Nothing but a black gal coming down the lane,\r\n    Nigger stole a pumkin an' started outer town;\r\n      Nigger heered it thunder, Lord, an' throwed dat pumkin down.\r\n\r\n\"Mistiss, I don't wanter tell you no mo' of dat.\r\n\r\n\"When us niggers ma'ied, dey didn't have no preacher. We jes' jumped\r\nover de broom, an' went on an' lived together. Iffen a gal went wrong,\r\ndey beat her nearly to death. Iffen you moved de place when you ma'ied,\r\nde other marsa had to buy you.\r\n\r\n\"De li'l niggers had big times. Us used to play, 'Green grow the willow\r\ntree, you swing my gal an' I swing yourn. Green grow de willow tree.'\r\nDey used to sceer up us niggers 'bout \"Raw Head an' Bloody Bones,\" gwine\r\nto ketch us dat was so sceer bad iffen us didn't mind 'em, but I ain't\r\nnever seed nor believed in ghostes. Us didn't get sick much 'caze us\r\ndidn't have no trash to eat an' Mistiss giv' us ebony of yarbs an' us\r\nwore sacks of yarbs 'roun' our necks too.\r\n\r\n\"The Yankees did plenty of harm. Marsa shot at some of dem; an' dey took\r\noff our cabin wagons. When us was freed dey singed, 'I'se gwine back to\r\nDixie, no more my heart to wander, never see my master no mo'.'\r\n\r\n\"Marsa called us all up an' told us we was jes' free as him. He give us\r\nall a suit of clo'es, some money, a mule, a cow, wagon, hog and a li'l\r\ncorn to start off on. Us moved to Dr. Lawrence Smiths near La-Fayette,\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\n\"Later years I ma'ied Jane Drake at the cafe in Opelika, Alabama, and by\r\nde jedge at twelve o'clock. She died, den I ma'ied Phoebe Ethen Drake.\r\nSome says de church can't save you, but I sho' feels safer in hit, an' I\r\njined 'caze I wants to be better dan I was an' try to be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaam Morgan\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Isaam Morgan*\r\n    --_Mary A. Poole, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n\"Mistis, I was bawn in 1853, 'cordin' to ole Miss's Bible, near Lotts\r\nLanding on the Alabama River.\" It was Isaam Morgan who spoke from his\r\nporch at 1657 Sligo Street, Mobile, Alabama. \"I made a special trip back\r\ndar a few months back to de ole place, an' Mistis' daughter looked it up\r\nfor me 'caze I done had forgot.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. James Morgan was my Massa, an' his wife, Miss Delia, was my Mistis.\r\nMy mammy's name was Ann Morgan, an' as for my pappy, I done forgot\r\nhis'n. I was raised raght dar in de white folks house, an' I had my own\r\nspecial place to sleep. I was de house boy, an' when I growed older I\r\ndriv' Mistis aroun' in de Ca'iage.\r\n\r\n\"Us niggers lived in sho-'nuff style. Us had our regular quarters whar\r\nus lived in white log cabins chinked wid mud, an' de slaves had built-in\r\nbeds an' a big open fireplace whar dey cooked. Us had plenty somp'n\r\nt'eat. All us had to do was to ask for it an' de Massa done de res'. Our\r\nrations was gib out to us eve'y Sadday. Some of de bes' food us ever had\r\nwas 'possum an' taters. Us'd go out at night wid a big sack, an' a pack\r\nof houn's an' twarn't long befo' we done treed a 'possum. Atter we done\r\ntreed him, de dogs would stan' aroun' de tree an' bark. Iffen de tree\r\nwas small, us could shake him out. Iffen it was big, one of de niggers\r\nhadda climb up it an' git ole Mr. 'Possum hisself.\r\n\r\n\"Funny things about 'possums, Miss; de bigger dey is seem lak de littler\r\nde tree dey picks to go up. It is sho-'nuff fun, dough, to go a trailin'\r\nth'ough de woods atter a 'possum or coon. De coon'll give you de bes'\r\nchase, but he ain't no good eatin' lak de 'possum. I seen a coon one\r\ntime when he was cornered bite de tip of a houn's nose off.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Morgan sol' wood to de steam boats, an' us slaves hadda cut de\r\nwood, an' split it up into smaller pieces. Any time a slave worked over\r\ntime or cut mo' wood dan he s'pose' to, Massa pay him money for it, caze\r\nwhenever one of us slaves seen somp'n we lak, we did jus' lak de white\r\nfolks does now. Us bought it.\r\n\r\n\"Massa never whupped none of his slaves; he jus' tole us whut to do an'\r\niffen we didn't do it, he'd call us to him an' he would say in his sorta\r\nway: 'Nigger! How many mo' times is I gotta tell you to do lak you\r\ntole?' Dat's all he would say, an' believe me Mistis, he hada a way of\r\nlookin' at you dat made you jump. When he bought a new slave dat wasn't\r\nuse to doin' what he was tol', 'twarn't long befo' massa had him in\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\"No'm none of our slaves ever tried to run away. Dey all knowed dey was\r\nwell off. We didn't have no oberseer but once. He was a mean un too. He\r\ntried to fight an' whup us slaves, an' one night six big nigger men\r\njumped on him an' scairt him mos' to death. Atter dat de massa wouldn't\r\nnever have no mo' oberseers. He tended to dat business hisself.\r\n\r\n\"Whut we do atter we finished work? Go to bed! Dat was de onl'es' place\r\nwe was fittin' for. Us was so tired us wouldn't lie down two minutes 'fo\r\nus was 'sleep. On some moonlight nights us was 'lowed to pick de cotton.\r\nDen us'd git a little res' de nex' day.\r\n\r\n\"Massa an' his fambly used brass lamps an' candles for light, an' a few\r\nof us slaves had brass lamps too, but most of de niggers used torch\r\nlights.\r\n\r\n\"Some of de plantations had a calaboose whar dey putt de slaves dat\r\nwouldn't behave. Dis calaboose was built of logs fastened together wid\r\nstout ropes an' sunk into de groun', but Massa didn't need no calaboose\r\nto make his niggers behave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Isaam Morgan, Mobile, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Yassum, us had remedies for ailments. We used wild hoarhound tea for de\r\nchills an' fever, an' sweet gum turpentine, an' mutton suet. Dey wan all\r\ngood uns too. But shucks! Warn't nothin' much ever de matter wid us\r\nniggers.\r\n\r\n\"Yassum, we used rock an' cotton to start de fires on de plantation, an'\r\nMassa had a flint lock rifle, too.\r\n\r\n\"De slaves had dere own special graveyard an' us'd make de coffins raght\r\non de place dar. When someone die, he was taken in a ox cart to de\r\ngrave, wid all de slaves a-walkin' 'long behine de cart singin' de\r\nspirituals.\r\n\r\n\"Our clothes was made mostly outen osnaburg wove on de plantation. We\r\nhad wool clothes for de winter time dat was carded on de place. We had\r\nshoes made by our own cobbler an' tanned on de plantation. We called\r\ndese brogans.\r\n\r\n\"Atter de surrender, de Yankees camped near our place, an' bought aigs\r\nf'um us. Dey offered me a hoss iffen I would go nawth wid dem, but I\r\njus' couldn't leave de Massa even dough I did wanted dat hoss mighty\r\nbad. I was twenty-one years old when Massa came to me one day an' say:\r\n'Isaam, you is a grown man now. You is got to boss your own business.\r\nIt's up to you to fin' work. I can't keep you no longer. Good luck\r\nIsaam. You has been a good nigger, an' you is gonna make somebody a good\r\nworker.'\r\n\r\n\"Atter I lef' Massa I worked at diff'ent jobs, sich as: loader,\r\nroustabout on different steamboats an' cotton picker. I worked on de\r\n_May Boyd_, _Lula D._ an' de _Gardner_. One of de ole songs sang on de\r\nboats went somp'n lak dis:\r\n\r\n    De John T. Moore\r\n    De Lula D.\r\n    An' all dem boats is mine\r\n    If you can't ship on de Lula D.\r\n    You ain't no man o' mine.\r\n\r\n\"I been ma'ied three times, Mistis, an' Lawd chile I done forgot de name\r\nof my fust wife.

Diard, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_A SLAVE INTERVIEWS A SLAVE_\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington extolling the virtues of a plain, homespun\r\nsuit--granite-jawed Andrew Jackson defying the British at\r\nPensacola--horror and massacre at Alabama's old Fort Mims--savages\r\nskulking near the fort, their bronzed bodies glistening in the hot\r\nAugust sunlight.\r\n\r\nThese were among memories of parchment-skinned Uncle Tony Morgan, who\r\nwas interviewed on Oct. 1, 1884 by Jim Thomas, another slave, and a\r\nrecord of the conversation held in the files of a family in Old Mobile,\r\nAlabama. Uncle Tony was 105 years old then.\r\n\r\nThe story is told by Thomas, former slave of the Diard family. Uncle\r\nTony was the slave of Mobile Judge H. Toulmin, grandfather of the later\r\nJudge H.T. Toulmin, who was appointed a judge by President Jefferson.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jim Thomas, Uncle Tony told him:\r\n\r\n\"Did I knowed Gen'l Andrew Jackson? Lord bless you honey, why, I knowed\r\nhim and remember Gen'l George Washington afore him.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Tony explained that he accompanied General Jackson when the\r\nwar-loving Tennessean marched from Mobile against Pensacola in 1814. He\r\nsaid he was serving as a wagoner, and remembered distinctly that the\r\nBritish surrendered on November 6. He recalled that, during the battle,\r\nJackson was standing talking with a group of officers when an enemy\r\nshell exploded near him.\r\n\r\n\"Move away, general,\" the old Negro quoted one of the officers as\r\nsaying, \"they'll kill you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jackson replied in a characteristic manner:\r\n\r\n\"Damn 'em--I'll have 'em all in hell tomorrow!\"\r\n\r\nConcerning George Washington, Uncle Tony told Jim Thomas that the great\r\nAmerican leader visited the town of Frankfort, Ky., and while there made\r\nan address. He wore a home-spun suit, which he pointed out as an example\r\nof what people might do in utilizing their products.\r\n\r\nFrankfort was highly excited when Washington arrived in the city, and\r\nUncle Tony told of a tiny urchin exclaiming with bitter disappointment\r\nin his voice:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Pa, he ain't nothing but a man!\"\r\n\r\nUncle Tony's memory of what occurred at Fort Mims was vivid, according\r\nto Jim Thomas. The older slave related that he was one of many Negroes\r\nin the fort at the time. He said the defenders had been sleeping off a\r\nnight of dissipation the morning William Weatherford's warriors\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nMen, women and children were butchered in the ensuing slaughter and the\r\nbuildings were fired. The massacre continued until noon, Uncle Tony\r\nsaid, when the Indians retreated with scalps and several Negro prisoners\r\nto their camping site, called the Holy Ground. Here, the half-starved\r\nNegroes lived in constant dread that they would be butchered by\r\nwar-inflamed Creeks.\r\n\r\nUncle Tony also recalled carrying the mail from Fort Stoddert, in\r\nAlabama, through the State and Mississippi. On several occasions he\r\nbarely escaped being scalped by Indians, he said.\r\n\r\nThe old Negro related further that his father was a wagoner under\r\nCornwallis when that general surrendered to Washington at Yorktown.\r\n\r\nConcerning his age and birthplace, Uncle Tony told Thomas he was born in\r\nDanville, Ky., about 1779. He went to Mobile in 1805 with Judge Toulmin.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the interview the old slave was extremely feeble and\r\nlame, and walked with the aid of a cane. His skin was dried and\r\nwrinkled, and cataracts on his eyes had totally deprived him of his\r\nsight. Despite these handicaps, however, Thomas said the old man's mind\r\nwas exceptionally clear, and his recollection of events occurring almost\r\na century before were remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMose\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Told by Edith Tatum, Greenville, Alabama*\r\n    --_Mildred Scott Taylor, Georgiana, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_UNCLE MOSE--A TRUE STORY_\r\n\r\nThe early spring sunshine sifted through the honey-suckle vines\r\nclustering around the cabin door, and made a network of dancing light\r\nupon the floor. A little Negro boy sat on the steps gazing silently up\r\nthe dusty road and idly listening to the insistent buzzing of insects\r\nhovering about the honey-suckle blooms.\r\n\r\n\"Don't yer see nothin' of her yet, Jerry?\" came in a querulous voice\r\nfrom a bed in a corner of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Naw, Unc' Mose. She ain't in sight yit, but it's mos' time fer 'er.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit 'pear lak dis mis'ry is er gittin' wus all de time,\" the voice went\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Sally say dat limerumunt gwine he'p it,\" essayed Jerry\r\nconsolingly.\r\n\r\n\"It don' do no good 'cep'in jess whilst Aun' Judy is er rubbin'. De\r\nrubbin' does mo' good dan de limerumunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dar she is, rat now!\" exclaimed Jerry presently.\r\n\r\n\"Praise de Lawd! fer de ole man sho is hongry en' got de mis'ry from his\r\nhaid to his heels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dar's ernudder lady wid Miss Sally.

Don' yer know\r\nhow ter ack when de quality is comin'?\" By the time the chairs had been\r\narranged to his notion the visitors were at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Uncle Mose,\" said the older woman brightly, as she put a\r\ncovered basket down on a table by the bed.\r\n\r\nShe had a strong, sweet face and smooth white hair, and the gracious\r\ndignity of a queen. \"I hope you rested well last night and are feeling\r\nvery much better. I have brought some one to see you. Now guess who she\r\nis,\" and she placed the girl where the sunshine fell across her face.\r\n\r\nUncle Mose turned his head on the pillow, and gazed eagerly at his\r\nvisitor. Then his old black face wrinkled into a smile. \"Lawd, honey,\r\nyou sho' mus' be one er Mars' Eddard's dahters, frum de favor!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Uncle Mose. It's Miss Caroline.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm so sorry to find you in bed, Uncle Mose,\" said the girl, coming\r\ncloser, while Miss Sally began taking an appetizing breakfast from the\r\nbasket and putting it on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Father told me not to come home without seeing Uncle Mose. He talks of\r\nyou so often.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man beamed with pleasure. \"Den Mr. Eddard's done fergive me for\r\nnot choosing him dat time,\" he said with a chuckle. \"Did you ebber h'yar\r\n'bout dat time I choosed mah master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Uncle Mose, none of your reminiscence until Jerry has given you\r\nyour breakfast. Then I know that Caroline will be delighted to hear all\r\nabout it,\" and Miss Sally smiled indulgently. \"Here, Caroline, put these\r\nflowers in water where Uncle Mose can see them, while I measure some\r\nmedicine for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat sho was er good breakfus', Miss Sally,\" said the old negro with a\r\nsigh of content, as Jerry gave him the last bit of waffle. \"Ole Aun'\r\nJincy allers was er good cook, en her ma befo' 'er. Couldn't nobody beat\r\nAun' Lucy cookin' in dem days. Ginger cakes? She made de bes' ginger\r\ncakes!

But de res' er Ole Marsters' boys nebber did\r\nfergive Mose fer dat,\" and he chuckled at the remembrance.\r\n\r\nCaroline laughed. \"Thank you, Uncle Mose, I've enjoyed hearing about it.\r\nI must go and see Mammy now. Next time I come I hope you will be\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"De ole man ain' had his foots ter de flo' in five weeks dis comin'\r\nSadd'y Miss Ca'line. Good bye, Miss Ca'line honey, come ergin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, Jerry, you run tell Aunt Judy to come up at once and rub Uncle\r\nMose's ankles,\" said 'Miss' Sally as Caroline left the cabin. \"I'll warm\r\nthis liniment and have it all ready.\" She stopped before the open\r\nfireplace and raked up the embers into a little blazing fire, and\r\nputting the saucer of turpentine on the floor at some distance, she\r\nstood up and turned toward the bed. Just then a spark from the fire fell\r\ninto the saucer, and the turpentine blazed up. 'Miss' Sally, startled,\r\nsprang back, but in so doing, her light cotton morning gown came in\r\ncontact with the blazing turpentine and was quickly ignited. She caught\r\nup her skirts and tried to put it out with her hands, but could not. For\r\nseveral seconds 'Miss' Sally stood face to face with an awful death.\r\n\r\n\"My God-er-Mighty!\" cried Uncle Mose, and with the agility of youth and\r\nhealth he sprang from the bed dragging a blanket with him, and throwing\r\nit around her, wrapped it close, extinguishing the flames just as Aunt\r\nJudy and Jerry appeared in the door.\r\n\r\n\"De Lawd in Hebben!\" cried fat Judy, her swift glance taking in Miss\r\nSally's white face, burned garments and helpless hands, and 'Uncle' Mose\r\ntottering back to his bed.\r\n\r\n\"Po' lamb! now jess look at dem han's! Lemme tie 'em up in wet sody this\r\nminute! You sho 'mos' got burned up, honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have, but for Uncle Mose,\" said 'Miss' Sally faintly, as she\r\nsank into a chair.\r\n\r\nAunt Judy turned stormy eyes upon the poor groaning old man. \"I'd lak\r\nter know how cum Unc' Mose jess foun' out he kin walk?\" she inquired\r\nbelligerently. \"I 'lowed some time ergo dat Mose was possumin'. I sho\r\nain' gwine to waste mo' elbo' grease on dat old hyp'crite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Judy,\" said her mistress sternly, \"Uncle Mose is no hypocrite. He\r\nhas inflammatory rheumatism. It was a miracle,\" she added reverently.\r\n\r\n\"Dat's hit!\" exclaimed Mose, eagerly. \"Er miracle! Hit was de\r\nLawd-er-Mighty let Mose git up den. Fer how you reckon I'd eber face\r\nMars' Wat ergin' ef I had to tell him I jess lay in de baid en let my\r\nlil' mistress burn up?

Lawdy chile, you knows I know Mr.\r\nPompy (my father). She laughed. \"I'll tell you anything I knows.\r\n\r\n\"I was jes' 'bout ten years come slavery done. I was borned down on de\r\nClayton place at Smith's Corners. My pappy he come from South Car'lina,\r\nwhere his pappy was sold. He name was Calop and my mammy was Hannah\r\nClayton. There was eight of us chillun. Fred, Silas, Calop, Mary,\r\nDolphus, Dora, Lula and me. Us all lived down in de quarters, which was\r\nfive log houses, daubed wid mud. Dem logs was big ones, hand-hewed, and\r\nde fireplaces was big, too. Us went to de fiel's early in de morning and\r\npicked us a mess of young hick'ry and oak leaves to scald and cook in de\r\npot wid meat. Dey made good greens and us had poke salad, too. (Made\r\nfrom the leaves of the pokeberry).\r\n\r\n\"When dey dried de fruit us would cook our kind of fruit cake. I don't\r\nrecollect what went in it. Dere was plenty though. Mistis had de fruit\r\ndried on tins in de yard, and at twelve o'clock every day all hands went\r\nto de house and turned de fruit.\r\n\r\n\"Our beds was homemade, scaffold bedsteads wid ropes wove acrost de top\r\nwhat could tighten up. Sometimes us had homewove bedspreads on de beds\r\nmost every day, but in gen'ally dat was for Sunday only.\r\n\r\n\"Our menfolks used to hunt possums and wild turkeys, but dey didn't mess\r\n'roun' none wid rabbits. They didn't waste time on fishing either.\r\n\r\n\"Ev'y morning in May Mistis would call us little niggers to de house and\r\nev'y other morning give us oil and turpentine. We made our own cloth for\r\nclothes. Our mammies wove us long drawers outen cotton. Dey bought wool\r\nand flannelet to make us pantalets. Us wore homemade homespun dresses.\r\nSome of hit was dyed and some checked. Us had shoes reg'lar in winter.\r\n\r\n\"Ole Marster Joe and Miss Rosa Clayton was good as gold. Dey had Sara,\r\nJane, Henry, and Joe. De live in a big, two story house wid six rooms to\r\nhit and had a brick kitchen off from de house out in de yard. Ole\r\nMarster had a big plantation and his two aunties live dere, too. Dey was\r\nMiss Easter and Miss Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\"De slave women folks what had chilluns was 'lowed to go home half hour\r\nby de sun to wash ev'y day, and ev'y Sunday morning all de little\r\nchillun had to be washed and carried to de Big House for de Mistis to\r\ninspect 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Us mostly stayed at home and didn't go 'bout none, and effen us went to\r\nMt. Jefferson Church us had to have a pass or de paterollers would sho'\r\ngit you. I did think dat 'Hark from the tomb in doleful sound, how\r\ncareful, how careful den ought I to live, wid what religious fear' was\r\nde prettiest thing, and I sho' did love to hear dem sing hit. I never\r\nseed de baptising, 'ca'se I used to go to de 'Piscopal Church wid Mistis\r\nand open gates and hold de hosses. I sot in de foot of her carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas dey'd give us provisions and de chillun some trash (meaning\r\ntoys). Dey sho' had good times on moonlight nights at de cornshuckings.\r\nDey would haul de corn from de fields and put it in a big ring, and as\r\ndey shucked dey would throw it in ring and den into de crib. Sometimes\r\ndey was so much corn it would stay on de ground 'twell it rotted.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dickey Williams' mother, Miss Emily, ma'ied while us was dere and\r\nmy grandma cooked de cake. My daddy made de cake stand. Hit had three\r\ntiers, each one full of little cakes wid de big cake on top. Hit sho'\r\nwas pretty.\r\n\r\n\"Dey let de little niggers have all de fun dey wanted. Us played jump\r\nrope and swung in de grapevine swings mostly. Den us had rag dolls. When\r\nany of us got sick, we was give hoarhound tea and rock candy.

Shelby, Jr. (Colored), Tuscumbia, Alabama_\r\n\r\n(Chapter 1--How Reared)\r\n\r\nI was born a slave in 1840, in Colbert County, Alabama. Education was\r\ndenied me, hence I grew up in ignorance. My mother and father were\r\ncarried from me when I was only nine years old, but as soon as chance\r\npresented itself I ran away and went to them. My white people brought me\r\nback, and as they were not cruel to their slaves they did not \"buck\" me.\r\nI stayed with them until I was fifteen summers old. During this time my\r\nmistress made all the children, both girls and boys, come to her every\r\nSunday, and she taught Sunday School. The book used was the old\r\nfashioned Catechism.\r\n\r\n    Jesus keep me near the cross,\r\n      There's a precious fountain,\r\n    Free to all, a healing stream,\r\n      Flows from Calvary's mountain.\r\n\r\nIt was against the law for them to learn to read and write, so she\r\ntaught them the Lord's prayer and a few other things in the book. She\r\nsaid that she wanted them to know how to pray, how to tell the truth and\r\nnot to steal, and always try to do right in the sight of everybody and\r\nin the sight of God. With these influences, I confessed a hope in Christ\r\nat the age of thirteen years.\r\n\r\n    Am I a soldier of the cross,\r\n      A follower of the lamb,\r\n    And shall I fear to own his cause,\r\n      Or blush to speak his name?\r\n\r\nWhen she did not teach herself, she had an adopted girl to do the same.\r\nFinally the adopted girl married and moved to the farm where I was born,\r\nthe farm from which I ran away. About this time, I was twenty years old.\r\nI felt that there was something for me to do. I began to lead prayer\r\nmeetings. Still I felt that there was more for me to do.\r\n\r\n(Chapter 2--Entering The Ministry)\r\n\r\nI felt sure that I was called to preach, though \"unlearned and\r\nignorant.\" I trembled at the thought of preaching the gospel, but\r\nsomething seemed to push me forward in that direction. So I asked the\r\npeople to let me preach. This request was granted. The people at that\r\ntime had no place or house of worship. I began to fast and pray night\r\nand day. Being \"unlearned and ignorant\" (Acts 4:13) my heart silently\r\nmurmured--\r\n\r\n    Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,\r\n    Feed me till I want no more.\r\n\r\nThis was the only school I attended, both day and night. At this time I\r\ndid not know \"A\" from \"B,\" but I met a man who could read a little. This\r\nman liked me and promised to teach me how to read, provided I would keep\r\nit a secret. This I gladly promised to do.\r\n\r\n    I am weak, Thou art mighty,\r\n    Hold me with Thy powerful hand.\r\n\r\nI secured a blue-back speller and went out on the mountain every Sunday\r\nto meet this gentleman, to be taught. I would stay on the mountain all\r\nday Sunday without food. I continued this way for a year and succeeded\r\nwell. I hired my own time and with my blue-back speller went to the\r\nmountain to have this man teach me. The mountain was the great school\r\nwhich I attended. I went from there to the blacksmith shop to work. From\r\nthat place I was captured by the Yankees and carried to war. As I was\r\ncrippled I was allowed to remain in the commissary department for about\r\nsix months. While we were at camp at Athens, Alabama General Forest came\r\nupon us and defeated, captured, and killed until they were almost\r\nliterally wiped out of existence. I had been kind to some little white\r\nchildren, by which I had won their love, and of course, the love of\r\ntheir parents, and stayed with them three days during the battle. I came\r\nto a river and turned aside to a farm from which all the people had gone\r\nto save themselves from the war, I got a man to help reach an island\r\nwhere I worked three days without anything to eat except grapes and\r\nmuscadines. I preferred to die on the island than to be killed by the\r\nsoldiers. Therefore, in time of danger, I rushed to this house and the\r\ngood people hid me and changed my clothes. Hence, when I was found I was\r\ntaken for one of the gentleman's slaves. When I was permitted by the man\r\nto try to return to LaGrange, and had gone some distance, I was caught\r\nby deserters from the Southern army, who voted to shoot me. They bound\r\nme and kept me overnight, intending to do away with me the next day. It\r\nwas a lonely desert on the Tennessee river. I could not sleep, so all\r\nnight I prayed to God, and the wives of the men prayed to God for the\r\npoor \"nigger,\" and also prayed to their cruel husbands. Their prayers\r\nprevailed, and I was robbed and let go. I had vowed not to reveal their\r\nwhereabouts. I left loving God and believing in his providence as I had\r\nnever believed before.\r\n\r\n    Earth has no sorrow that\r\n    Heaven cannot heal.\r\n\r\nI went home and got another spelling-book, although it was not allowed.\r\nSome of my own people told my master that I had a book trying to read.\r\nHe sent for me to come to the house. I obeyed, though I dreaded to meet\r\nhim, not knowing what the consequence would be. But his heart had been\r\ntouched by Divine power and he simply told me that he heard that I had a\r\nbook, and if I was caught with it I would be hung. So I thanked him and\r\ndeparted. Notwithstanding my master's counsel I thirsted for knowledge\r\nand got some old boards and carried them to my house to make a light by\r\nwhich I could see how to read. I would shut the doors, put one end of a\r\nboard into the fire, and proceed to study; but whenever I heard the dogs\r\nbarking I would throw my book under the bed and peep and listen to see\r\nwhat was up. If no one was near I would crawl under the bed, get my\r\nbook, come out, lie flat on my stomach, and proceed to study until the\r\ndogs would again disturb me. I did this for many nights. I continued in\r\nthis way to try to learn to spell and read as best I could.\r\n\r\n    Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness,\r\n    for they shall be filled.\r\n\r\nI, like the Ethiopian, wanted a guide. I moved to Mrs. McReynold's. God\r\nbless her! She gave me a lesson every night for a period of four years.\r\nThen I went to my old master's brother, whose wife helped me every night\r\nas long as I would go to her for help. Rev. Shackleford (white) greatly\r\naided me for a period of three years.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls, grasp these golden opportunities which are now extended\r\nyou from the school room. \"Unlearned and ignorant\" as I was I came along\r\nthat way until the present time. My readers have better chances than I\r\nhad. So I hope that they will make good use of their time and make my\r\nheart feel glad to see them setting their marks high and preparing\r\nthemselves for the Great Beyond where all must go. Thither all nations\r\nwill be called before the mighty judgment seat of the Ruler of the\r\nuniverse to give an account for the deeds done in this world. My prayer\r\nfor the reader is, that they may make strong, useful, wise and Christian\r\nmen and women, and at the end of time meet their God in peace.\r\n\r\n(Chapter 3--My Work)\r\n\r\nI will endeaver, in this chapter, to tell something about my works and\r\nwhereabouts. I was ordained to the gospel ministry in 1867 by Rev. Mr.\r\nSlater (white), and Rev. Henry Bynum. Rev. Stephens Coleman and Rev.\r\nHenry Bynum, aided by Dr. Joseph Shackleford (white) laid down the\r\nfoundation stones for the colored Baptist churches in Morgan, Franklin,\r\nColbert, Lauderdale, and Lawrence counties, Alabama. I am now pastor of\r\nthe First Baptist Church, at Tuscumbia, Alabama, which is the best Negro\r\nedifice in North Alabama. This church was organized thirty-five years\r\nago, by me, with seventy-five members, but it now had a membership of\r\nnine hundred. I have pastored it for lo! these many years. This church\r\nis an excellent brick edifice. A few other brethren and myself organized\r\nthe Muscle Shoals Baptist Association--one of the oldest and largest\r\nassociations in Alabama. I have been Moderator for four years and its\r\nTreasurer for six years. I built the church at Russellville, Alabama,\r\nand pastored it for four years, and then ordained Bro. P. Jones and\r\nrecommended him as pastor. I built the Barten church and pastored it for\r\na period of fifteen years, after which I recommended Rev. James Hampton\r\nthere as pastor. I pastored the Cherokee church five years, ordained\r\nBro. Dennis Jackson and recommended him there as pastor. I pastored\r\nLiberty Baptist church for three years, ordained Bro. Alex Brown and\r\nrecommended him there as pastor. I served Iuka, Mississippi for five\r\nyears and then recommended a Brother from the West, who belonged to the\r\nMt. Olive Association, to it. I built up the Sheffield church, pastored\r\nit three years and then recommended Bro. G.B. Johnson there as shepherd.\r\nI also built up Mt. Moriah church at Prides, Alabama. I frequently\r\nuttered these words:\r\n\r\n    Where Jesus leads me I will follow\r\n    and his footsteps I'll pursue.\r\n\r\nI organized St. Paul church (Colbert County) and pastored it for two\r\nyears. Rev. E.C. White, who is now Assistant Moderator of the Muscle\r\nShoals Association, was ordained by me. I have ordained more than twenty\r\npreachers to the gospel ministry, baptized six thousand persons, united\r\nin marriage five thousand couples, and buried about seven thousand\r\npersons. I have been faithful to every charge.\r\n\r\n    Hark the voice of Jesus calling,\r\n      Who will and work today?\r\n    Fields are white and harvest waiting,\r\n      Who will bear the sheaves away?\r\n\r\nI have never left the old land mark. Not an one of the churches which I\r\nhave pastored has brought a charge against me.\r\n\r\n    The deepest secrets of our hearts\r\n    shall shortly be made known.\r\n\r\nI have been married three times and have known no woman but my wife,\r\n\"though unlearned and ignorant.\" I have never had but one \"fuss\" with my\r\nwife. I told her at one time to hush and she failed to do so, then I\r\nslapped her, after which I went to the Lord in prayer and asked to be\r\nforgiven. I regret very much indeed to inform the world in print that I\r\nhave been drunk from intoxicating liquors twice, which was before I\r\nprofessed religion. Notwithstanding I have ever held up temperance and\r\naimed to keep it high until Shiloh comes to gather up his jewels. The\r\nfollowing recommendation will show what the best people of Tuscumbia\r\nthink of me:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Tuscumbia, Ala., March 13, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\n    To whom it may concern:--\r\n\r\n    We take pleasure in stating that we have known the bearer of\r\n    this letter, Rev. Wilson Northcross for a number of years, and\r\n    that he is a conscientious, intelligent colored man of good\r\n    character. He has been pastor of the Missionary Baptist Church\r\n    of this place since the war, having been instrumental in\r\n    building the church, and always has made a good citizen. We\r\n    believe him in every way worthy of the respect and confidence of\r\n    his people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Fox Delony, Judge of Probate\r\n                                          Jas. H. Simpson, Circuit Clerk\r\n                                          Chas. A. Simpson, Deputy Clerk\r\n                                                           W.H. Sawtelle\r\n                                                          Max Lueddemann\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following resolution was adopted by the church which I pastored\r\nthirty years:\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That Rev. W.E. Northcross, our pastor, is a good,\r\n    moral, Christian man. He has been our pastor for thirty years,\r\n    and we can truthfully say that he teaches in all things by\r\n    example as well as by precept.\r\n\r\n--TUSCUMBIA MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH\r\n\r\nThe history of this church has undergone many changes, but they all\r\nworked for its betterment. At the close of the Civil war the few members\r\nwent from brush arbor to brush arbor for three years. Then they held\r\nservices in gin houses and under shelters for two years and six months.\r\nThen as the church was growing rapidly, they thought best to draw out,\r\nbuy a lot, and build to themselves. So they bought a lot for what they\r\npaid fifty dollars ($50.) and erected a five hundred dollars ($500.)\r\nbuilding thereon in which to worship the Lord. So the church continued\r\nto grow until it now has a membership of nine-hundred, a splendid brick\r\nedifice worth about six thousand dollars ($6,000.) and a thriving\r\ncongregation. The church has never had but one pastor, and I have been\r\nas faithful as a clock. Through me (Rev. W.E. Northcross) the church was\r\nbuilt, and I have ever since held high the Baptist doctrine throughout\r\nNorth Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWade Owens\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Wade Owens*\r\n    --_Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_WADE OWENS HEARD ABE LINCOLN SPEAK_\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Wade Owens of Opelika was born in Loachapoka, Alabama, in\r\n1863 and just missed slavery, but he has heard his homefolks talk so\r\nmuch about freeing the Negroes, he feels as if he was grown then. His\r\nmother and father, Wade and Hannah Owens, came from Virginia and moved\r\ninto \"Jenks Quarters\" on the Berry Owens place. They had several\r\nchildren, Wade, Nettie, Chance, Anderson and Iowa. Wade used to help\r\ndrive up the cows. This cabin was of logs, mud and sticks with leaf and\r\nmud chimneys and slab floors. The beds fitted into the wall with plank\r\nsides, two posts with planks nailed on top, resembling tables. A box\r\nserved as a dresser.\r\n\r\n\"All ash-cakes were cooked on poplar an' chestnut leaves, when dey\r\nroasted taters,\" Wade says. \"Us chillun used to go early in de mornin'\r\nan' lick de honey offen de leaves for sweets den. Us didn't wear nothin'\r\nbut our long shirts, an' us had homemade hats and brogans, hard as\r\nbricks with brass caps on de toes. I thought dey was de prettiest things\r\nI ever seed.\r\n\r\n\"Marsa Berry an' Miss Fanny Owens was good to us niggers. My daddy was\r\nde carriage driver for Miss Fanny, but take keer of dat man Ben Boddy,\r\nthe overseer. He was de meanes' man God ever put life in. He wouldn't\r\nlet us have no fire, matter not how cold, us had to work jes' de same or\r\nde nigger hounds 'ud sho' get you. Iffen not dog caught, dey would beat\r\nyou to death nearly. He was so mean marsa run him off. Dey blew de\r\nrisin' horn an' us worked from daylight 'twell dark or frum can to\r\ncan't.\r\n\r\n\"Marsa had a pretty two-story log house, big columns an' big porch. He\r\nhad 'bout two or three hundred acres an' worked 'bout three hundred\r\nslaves. Us had a jail an' locked runaways in hit. Brother Lockhart used\r\nto preach to us niggers in de white church at Lebanon an' us walked to\r\nhit.\r\n\r\n\"My daddy was sold fer $160. When dey put chains on de niggers dey was\r\nput 'roun' de legs and arms an' to a post. Dey took pains to ho'p my\r\nmammy an' pappy to learn. Dey would teach de Bible to 'em too. Marsa\r\nused to sing dem good ole songs, 'My heart frum de tomb, a doleful\r\nsound. My ears attend to cry,' and 'Amazing grace how sweet it sounds.'\r\n\r\n\"At baptising dey'd give de water invitation an' den go in water. An'\r\ndidn't dey come out happy, shouting and praying? Ol' man Buck could hear\r\ndem two miles off, but hit was a glorious baptising.\r\n\r\n\"All de hands stopped when dey was a funeral an' didn't work no mo'\r\n'till de body was buried. All de whites would go too. Dey would make de\r\nboxes, pour hot water over de plank to shape it up into a casket, den\r\ntake turpentine an' smut to paint it. Den another big time, settin' up\r\nwid de dead, sing, shout an' holler an' try to preach.\r\n\r\n\"De patrollers would come to de colored frolic, an' one time a han'\r\nslipped off an', gentlemen, didn't he give 'em trouble to ketch him, an'\r\ndey didn't. When dey had dem Saddy night frolics an' dance all night\r\nlong an' nearly day when hit was goin, dey would turn de pot upside down\r\nin de floor to hold de soun' in. My daddy pick de banjo. At de\r\ncornshuckings dey'd sing 'All 'Roun' de Corn Pile Sally,' an' dey had\r\nwhiskey an' gin. Us had good time on Chris'mas, give us toys, syrup\r\ncandy, light bread an' grape wine.\r\n\r\n\"My brother married up at de Big House an' dey giv' him a big dance an'\r\nmarsa made me drunk. 'Twas fust one den t'other giv' it to me an'\r\nknocked me out. Dey had de preacher an' didn't jump de broom. Dey had de\r\npreacher so would be tied good. Dey would tell us chillun all kinds of\r\nghos' stories 'bout witches gittin' outter dey skins. Us had free\r\njumping grapevine ropes an' mumble peg. One night I was at Notasulga an'\r\nI heerd some singing. I stopped an' hit was right at my feet an' would\r\ngo futher off. I took out wid hit an' hit kept stoppin' an' startin' off\r\nag'in 'twell hit giv' out entirely. I looked to see where I was an' I\r\nwas at de cemetery an' nothin' didn't bother me neither. I eased out an'\r\nshut de gate an' never foun' whut carried me dere.\r\n\r\n\"When us 'ud git sick, dey would bleed you, stick somp'n in your arm and\r\ndraw de blood. Den dey would giv' us scurry grass and fever weed.\r\nBone-set was use' as teas for colds an' fever to sweat you. An' hit sho'\r\nwould sweat you, too. Marsa said war was comin' an' thought hit was to\r\nfree us. Pappy went to war with young marsa an' stayed 'twell he got\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rev. Wade Owens, Opelika, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Dey hid de carriage horses, meat, silver an' plates. Yankees asked\r\niffen marsa was good, an' us said yes. Dey searched de smokehouse an'\r\nsome scraps no good an' nothin' but scrappy horses so dey didn't bother\r\na thing. Us stayed one year an' worked on one-eighth farm. The Ku Klux\r\nKlan was turrible. One John Lyons would cut off a woman's breast an' a\r\nman's ear or thumb.\r\n\r\n\"Atter I got growed I married Leila Benford at Mr. Lockhart's house, an'\r\nus had a nice little frolic, wid cake, syrup pudding an' wine. It was a\r\nfine night wid me, 'caze all kissed de bride. Us had fourteen children,\r\njes' eight living, Minnie, Wade, Robert, Walter, Viola, Joe, Jim and\r\nJohnnie, an' ten grand-chilun.\r\n\r\n\"I heered Abraham Lincoln speak once at Chicaumaugee Mountain an' he\r\nsaid 'For people, by people, and through people.'

She could find answers\r\nto some of my questions, but some she couldn't get straight. She was\r\njust as clean and neat as she had always been, clad in an apron dress\r\nthat she would call a \"Mother Huggard.\"\r\n\r\nMolly is eighty-five years old and lives with her sister Edna in a\r\nsimple cabin, with a little patch of flowers between it and the field\r\nwhere Edna is still young enough to work. Molly was a housewife's\r\ntreasure in the days gone by, but now she is too feeble to do more than\r\nwork her little patch of flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Molly Parker, Lee County, Alabama_]\r\n\r\nShe was born in Virginia but was brought to Alabama when a child and\r\nsold to a Mr. Dunn, near Salem. Her mother and father were John and\r\nFanny, the parents of four children, Molly, Edna, Sam and Albert.\r\n\r\n\"I was a big size housegirl, but I sho' could work,\" Molly recalled.\r\n\"Mr. Digby blowed a big bugle early every morning to get us all up and\r\ngoing by bright light. Mr. Digby was a good overseer and treated all de\r\nslaves de best he knew how.\r\n\r\n\"I married Dick Parker on a Sunday and dey fixed us a big dinner wid\r\nmore good things to eat, but I was too happy to eat much myself.

I remembers a slave on our plantation dat was always arunnin'\r\naway. De Massa try beatin' him but dat didn't do no good. Dat nigger\r\nwould run away in spite of nothin' they could do. One day de massa\r\ndecided he was goin' to take de nigger to Mobile an' swap him for\r\nanudder one. De Misstis tol' him to leave de ole fool alone, said it\r\nwarn't worth the trouble.

Morgan Smith_\r\n\r\n_EX-SLAVE LEADER RECALLS OLD DAYS_\r\n\r\nSimon Phillips, ex-slave, at 90 years is still as clear-thinking as a\r\nyoung man, and a leader among the oldsters of his race in Birmingham and\r\nAlabama. He has been for the past twenty-three years president of the\r\nunion of ex-slaves which is composed of 1,500 Negroes scattered\r\nthroughout Alabama. He is the only one of the Birmingham organizers of\r\nthe society living today and though one of the oldest of his group, he\r\nshows but few signs of decrepitude. He walks with the aid of a hickory\r\ncane which has been in his possession for almost a half century, and his\r\nmemory is not only accurate but vivid. His physical activity is shown by\r\nthe fact that he had already spaded his garden and tiny stalks had\r\npushed themselves above the ground on a plot of earth, covering\r\napproximately seventy-five yards square, on the Spring morning when he\r\ntook \"a little time off\" to talk of the past.\r\n\r\nWell does he recall the days when, under Alabama skies in the 1860's, he\r\ncurried his master's fine carriage horses; the times old Aunt Hannah\r\ncured him of \"achin's\" with vegetable and root herbs; the nights he\r\nspent in the slave quarters singing spirituals with his family.\r\n\r\nSimon Phillips was one of 300 Negroes belonging to Bryant Watkins, a\r\nplanter of Greensboro, Alabama. He was a house man, which means that he\r\nmixed the drinks, opened the carriage doors, brought refreshments on the\r\nporch to guests, saw that the carriage was always in the best of\r\ncondition and tended the front lawn. When asked about slave days, he\r\ngets a far-away expression in his eyes; an expression of tranquil joy.\r\n\r\n\"People,\" he says, \"has the wrong idea of slave days. We was treated\r\ngood. My massa never laid a hand on me durin' the whole time I was wid\r\nhim. He scolded me once for not bringin' him a drink when I was supposed\r\nto, but he never whup me.\"\r\n\r\nThe old slave added that every plantation had a still and there was much\r\nbrandy, but he rarely ever saw a drunk man. He says that when the men\r\nfelt themselves becoming intoxicated, they would go home and lie down;\r\nnow, he says, they go home and fall down.\r\n\r\nThe plantation on which Simon lived was seven miles long and three miles\r\nwide. When luncheon was served, the Negroes far off in the bottom lands\r\nhad their food brought to them by the trash gang (boys and women) while\r\nthose in the nearer cotton fields ate in a large mess hall. The food\r\nconsisted of turnip greens, meat, peas, crackling bread and syrup, and\r\nplenty of it. \"Not since those days,\" he states, \"have I had such good\r\nfood.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the marriage situation, Simon?\" he was asked. \"How did you\r\ngo about getting a wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, nigger jus' go to the massa and tell him that there's a gal over\r\nin Cap'n Smith's place that he want for a wife, if she happen to be\r\nthere. Then the massa go to Cap'n Smith and offer to buy her. Maybe he\r\ndo and maybe he don't. It depend on whether the Cap'n will sell her, and\r\niffen she a good strong, healthy nigger. Niggers was bought mostly like\r\nhosses. I was too young to have me a wife when I was wid de massa, but I\r\ngot me one later on after the war.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Simon Phillips, Birmingham, Alabama_]\r\n\r\nDuring the War between the States, Simon served as body guard for John\r\nEdward Watkins, son of the plantation owner. Body guards went with their\r\nowners and cleaned the guns, kept the camp in order and did some\r\ncooking. Simon entered the war at the age of fourteen in Joe Wheeler's\r\n51st cavalry. He distinctly recalls the time he stood within ten feet of\r\nthe great general while he was making a speech.\r\n\r\nSometimes slaves were parted from their families, because when one\r\nplanter bought a Negro from another planter, he did not necessarily buy\r\nhis wife or children, or husband, as the case might be. The slaves were\r\nadvertised around and put on a block to stand while they were auctioned.\r\nWomen invariably brought more than men. He was asked, \"about overseers,\r\nSimon. What sort of men were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he answered, \"some was mighty mean. When the massa be away, they\r\ntried to think up things to whup us for. But when the massa around, had\r\nhe catch 'em gettin' ready for to beat a slave, he say, 'don't cut no\r\nblood from that Nigger!'\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Hale County in 1847, Simon Phillips stayed with his master until\r\n1886 at which time he went to live in Tuscaloosa to earn 17c a day, but\r\nhe says he fared better on it than on three dollars now.\r\n\r\nAfter the war many Negroes stayed with their masters and he remembers\r\nthat some of the carpetbaggers came through his plantation and tried to\r\nmake the ex-slaves stake off the land, saying that half of it belonged\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\"One day,\" says Simon, \"a few niggers was stickin' sticks in the ground\r\nwhen the massa come up.\r\n\r\n\"'What you Niggers doin'?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'We is stakin' off de land, massa. The Yankees say half of it is ourn.'\r\n\r\n\"The massa never got mad. He jus' look calm like.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen, niggers' he says, 'what's mine is mine, and what's yours is\r\nyours. You are just as free as I and the missus, but don't go foolin'\r\naround my land. I've tried to be a good master to you. I have never been\r\nunfair. Now if you wants to stay, you are welcome to work for me. I'll\r\npay you one third the crops you raise. But if you wants to go, you sees\r\nthe gate.'\r\n\r\n\"The massa never have no more trouble. Them niggers jus' stays right\r\nthere and works. Sometime they loaned the massa money when he was hard\r\npushed. Most of 'em died on the old grounds. I was the youngest of a\r\nfamily of sixteen and I has one sister still livin' on the old\r\nplantation. I'm going down to see her next week, 'cause I can never tell\r\nwhen the Great Master is goin' to call. We's gotta be ready when he\r\ndoes, and both us is gettin' mighty old. I wanta be sure and see her and\r\nthe old place once more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoxy Pitts\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Roxy Pitts*\r\n    --_Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_ROXY PITTS RECALLS CHILDHOOD_\r\n\r\n\"I don't know 'zackly whar I was born,\" said Aunt Roxy Pitts, \"but it\r\nwas summuz 'roun Youngsboro, Alabama, en it was in 1855, fo' de wah\r\nstarted, dat Ole Marster said I was born.

Her\r\ngrandmother was a free woman who came to Tuscaloosa as a servant in the\r\n1820's and was rescued from a man who claimed ownership, but whose claim\r\nwas disallowed. The grandmother went to Gainesville, with her slave\r\nhusband for whom she bought freedom.\r\n\r\nOne of her daughters, who was Carrie Pollard's Aunt Cynthia, was not so\r\nlucky. She couldn't buy her husband free. The story, told so often to\r\nCarrie when she was a child, is still a bright memory to the mulatto\r\nwoman who was born in 1859 and still lives in Gainesville in the house\r\nof her birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Carrie Pollard, Gainesville, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"My Aunt Cynthy,\" said Carrie, \"was free born in North Carolina. She\r\ncome down here to Gainesville, an' though the deed sez you can't take a\r\nblue veined chile an' make a slave outa her, de man whut brought her\r\nmade like he owned her or sump'in'. She lived on one plantation wid her\r\nguardian. Tom Dobbs, a slave nigger whut belonged to Mr. Dobbs here in\r\nGainesville, he lived on another farm cross de road. An' dey couldn't\r\nmarry, 'caze Mr. Dobbs wouldn't sell Tom an' Aunt Cynthy's white folks\r\nwouldn't let her marry, so dey jes' taken up an' went ahead. Her an' Tom\r\nhad nine chillun, as fine looking mulattoes ez you'd wanta see. An' old\r\nMr. Dobbs wanted 'em an' he couldn't get 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Cynthy was a good midwife, so a white lady sent fer her to come to\r\nSumterville, Alabama, to nuss her an' she went. An' while she was dere,\r\nshe dream't sump'in' done happened to her chillun an' dat dey was in\r\ntrouble. So she tole de white lady she was nussin' 'bout whut she\r\ndream't an' she said, 'Mammy, iffen you is worried 'bout your chillun\r\nI'ze gwineter send you to a fortune teller an' see whut's de matter.'\r\n\r\n\"De fortune teller cut de cards, an' den she looked up en tole Aunt\r\nCynthia 'All yo' chillun an' your husband done gone an' I can't tell you\r\nwhere dey's at.' So Aunt Cynthia run back an' tole de white lady. She\r\ncalled her husband an' he had one of his niggers saddle up two hosses\r\nan' ride wid Aunt Cynthy back to Gainesville. When she foun' her\r\nguardian, Mr. Steele, he met her wid de news dat dey was tuck to DeKalb,\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\"He got on his hoss an' tuck some other white men wid him, an' dey\r\ncaptured old man Dobbs right dere wid Tom an' de nine chillun. Dey done\r\nstopped an' camped an' was cookin' supper. So Mr. Steele tole him he\r\ncould keep Tom, 'caze he was hissen, an' a slave, but Cynthy was free\r\nborn an' he couldn't have her chillun. But Mr. Dobbs sez he didn't want\r\nTom nohow, caze he was part Indian an' no 'count an' wouldn't work. So\r\nMr. Steele bought Tom for Aunt Cynthy an' brought 'em all back to live\r\nwid him. An' he give Aunt Cynthy an' Tom an' de chillun a nice house\r\nright 'cross de branch here after surrender.\"\r\n\r\nCarrie tells of how her grandmother used to send them to the mill in\r\nGainesville with wheat, \"jes' lack you do corn nowadays, to git flour.\r\nAn' us git de grudgins an' de seconds an' have de bes' buckwheat cakes\r\nyou ever et.\"\r\n\r\nShe says there are more black Negroes now in Gainesville than she has\r\never seen. She says, \"Hit use to be a sight to see 'bout fifty bes'\r\nlookin' mulatto girls up in de public square here listenin' to de ban'\r\nan' nussen' de chillun, not five black ones in de bunch. An' dey had\r\ngood sense, too. Us didn't have no clocks, so us white mistis would say,\r\n'Yawl come home a hour by sun to do de night work,' an' us didn't hardly\r\never miss it.\" She says her grandmother sent her two daughters to school\r\nin Mobile, and they went down the river from Gainesville in a river boat\r\ncalled _Cremonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrene Poole\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Irene Poole*\r\n    --_Susie R.

At her feet several\r\nchickens scratched and waited for the soft plop of an over ripe fig as\r\nit fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nAunt Irene's back is bent with age and rheumatism, but her two-room\r\ncabin is as clean and neat as a pin. Her small yard is a mass of color\r\nwhere marigolds, zinnias, verbena and cockscomb run riot, and over the\r\nroughly-made arch at the gate trailed cypress vine in full bloom. \"Good\r\nmorning Aunt Irene,\" I said. \"A penny for your thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well honey, I don't know as dey is wo'th a penny; not to you anyhow. I\r\nwas jes' stud'in' 'bout ole times an' 'bout mah ole marster. You know if\r\nhe was livin' today he would be a hundred an' sixteen years ole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was your master Aunt Irene? Tell me about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"His name was Jeff Anderson Poole an' he was de bes' man in de world.\r\nMah ole miss was name Mollie. I was born on his plantation three miles\r\nfrom Uniontown eighty five years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Mah pappy, Alfred Poole, b'longed to Marse Jeff an' he bought mah\r\nmammy, Palestine Kent, from another plantation 'cause mah pappy jes'\r\ncouldn' do no work fer thinkin' 'bout her.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Jeff paid fifteen hunderd dollars for my mammy an' her three\r\nlittle chillun. Marse Jeff was rich, he owned three big plantations an'\r\nLawd knows how many niggers. Dey was a hunderd head on our plantation.\r\nHe lacked to race horses an' had a stable full o' fine racers. I spec'\r\nhe made lots o' his money on dem horses. Miss Mollie say when he win he\r\nswell out his ches' an' stick his thum's in de armhole of his ves' an'\r\ntalk 'bout it, but when he lose he don't say nothin'.\r\n\r\n\"Yas ma'am dere was always plenty to eat. A thousan' poun's o' meat\r\nwasn't nothin' to kill on our plantation. My mammy was de cook in de big\r\nhouse an' my pappy driv de carriage an' went 'roun' wid Marse Jeff when\r\nhe tuck trips. I was a house servant too. When I wasn' nothin' mo' in a\r\nbaby, de oberseer's wife tuck me to train, so I would know how to ac' in\r\nde big house.\r\n\r\n\"One day she started to give me a whuppin'. Us was out in de yard an'\r\nwhen she bent over to git a switch I runned under her hoopskirt. When\r\nshe look 'roun' she didn't see me nowhar. After while she started on up\r\nto de house an' I runned along wid her under de hoopskirt, takin' little\r\nsteps so I wouldn't trip her up, till I seed a chance to slip out.\"\r\nIrene threw back her head and laughed loud and long at this amusing\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nAsked then about her mistress she said: \"Yas ma'am she was good. She\r\nnever punished me, she used to go 'roun' de quarters eve'y mornin' to\r\nsee 'bout her sick niggers. She always had a little basket wid oil,\r\nteppentine an' number six in it. Number six was strong medicine. You had\r\nto take it by de drap. I always toted de basket. She gived me mah\r\nweddin' dress. It was white tarletan wid ban's o' blue ribbin. I sole de\r\ndress las' year but I can show you de pantalets she made me. I used to\r\nwear 'em to meetin' on Sunday when us had singin' an' de preacher said\r\nwords.\" Aunt Irene brought out the deep ruffled pantalets carefully\r\nfolded and yellow with age, she had treasured them for seventy-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"No ma'am, Marse Jeff didn't go to de war, I don't know why. I guess it\r\nwas 'cause he was so rich. Now don't you be thinkin' he was gun shy,\r\n'cause he wasn't an' he done his part too 'cause he took keer o' five\r\nwidders an' dey chillun when dey men got kilt in de war.\r\n\r\n\"My pappy lef de night de Yankees tuck Selma. It was on Sunday, an' I\r\nain't seed him since.\r\n\r\n\"After de surrender us staid on with Marse Jeff. Us didn't keer nothin'\r\n'bout bein' free 'cause us had good times on de plantation. On Sadday\r\ndey had corn shuckin's an' de niggers had a week at Chris'mas wid\r\npresents for eve'ybody. Camping at de big house an' mo' to eat in one\r\nday den I sees now in a year.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Irene, do you remember anything about the conjurers in the old\r\ndays?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't put much sto' by dem folks. Dey used to give you de han' so you\r\ncould please yo' mistess an' dey would sell you hush water in a jug.\r\nHush water was jes' plain water what dey fixed so if you drink it you\r\nwould be quiet an' patient. De mens would git it to give to dey wives to\r\nmake 'em hush up. I reckon some of de mens would be glad to git some now\r\n'cause gals dese days is got too much mouf.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNicey Pugh\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Nicey Pugh*\r\n    --_Ila B.

My pappy's name was Hamp West an' my mammy was Sarah\r\nWest. All my folks belonged to Massa Jim Bettis, an' was born an' raised\r\non his place.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a little pickaninny I worked in Massa Jim's house, sweepin'\r\nan' a-cleanin'. Us slaves had to be up at de house by sunup, build de\r\nfires an' git de cookin' started. Dey had big open fireplaces wid\r\npotracks to hang de pot on. Dat's whar us boiled de vegetables. An'\r\nhoney, us sho had plenty somp'n' t'eat: greens, taters, peas, rosenyurs\r\nan' plenty of home killed meat. Sometimes my oldest brother, Joe West,\r\nan' Friday Davis, anudder nigger, went huntin' at night an' kotched mo'\r\npossums dan we could eat. Dey'd ketch lots of fish; 'nuf to las' us\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\n\"I remembers one day when me an' anudder little nigger gal was agoin'\r\natter de cows down in de fiel' an' us seed whut I reckon' was de Ku Klux\r\nKlan. Us was so skeered us didn't know whut to do. One of 'em walked up\r\nto us an' say: 'Niggers, whar you agoin'?'\r\n\r\n\"'Us is jus' atter de cows, Mr. Ku Klux,' us say. 'Us ain't up to no\r\ndebilment.'\r\n\r\n\"'All right den,' dey say, 'jus' you be sho dat you don't git up to\r\nnone.'\r\n\r\n\"Atter we got home us told de massa 'bout de 'sperience, an' he jus'\r\nlaugh. He tol' us dat we warn't goin' to be hurt iffen we was good; he\r\nsay dat it was only de bad niggers dat was goin' to be got atter by dem\r\nKu Klux.\r\n\r\n\"When we was little we didn't hab no games to play, kaze Massa Jim an'\r\nMiss Marfa didn't hab no chilluns, an' I ain't neber had no speriences\r\nwid ha'nts or hoodoos. Dey neber teach us to read or write kaze when de\r\nniggers learn anything, dey would git upitty an' want to run away. We\r\nwould hab Sad'day afternoons off, den us would sweep de yards, an' set\r\naroun' on benches an' talk. It was on de benches dat mos' of us slaves\r\nset in warm weather. We et outen tin cups an' us used iron spoons to\r\nshovel de food in.\r\n\r\n\"At Christmas time, Massa would have a bunch of niggers to kill a hog\r\nan' barbecue him, an' de womens would make 'lasses cake, an' ole massa\r\nJim had some kinda seed dat he made beer outen, an' we-alls drank beer\r\n'roun' Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"But dere warn't no udder time such as New Years. Us all celebrated in a\r\nbig way den. Most of dem no 'count niggers stayed drunk fo' three days.\r\n\r\n\"An' as fo' de funerals, I don't eber remember but three white folks\r\ndyin'. Dey jus' didn't seem to die in dem days, an' de ones dat did die\r\nwas mostly kilt by somp'n'. One white gentman got hisself kilt in a gin\r\n'chinery an' anudder was kilt a workin' on de big road. Den dere was a\r\nwhite 'oman who was kilt by a nigger boy kaze she beat him for sicking a\r\ndog on a fine milk cow. He was de meanest nigger boy I eber seed. I'll\r\nneber forgits de way dem white mens treated him atter he done had his\r\ntrial. Dey drug him through de town behin' a hoss, an' made him walk\r\nober sharp stones wid his bare feets, dat bled lak somebody done cut 'em\r\nwid a knife. Dey neber gib him no water all dat day an' kep' him out in\r\nde boilin' sun till dey got ready to hang him. When dey got ready to\r\nhang him dey put him up on a stand and chunked rocks at his naked body;\r\ndey thro gravel in his eyes and broke his ribs wid big rocks. Den dey\r\nput a rope around his neck an' strung him up till his eyes pop outen his\r\nhead. I knowed it was a blessin' to him to die.\r\n\r\n\"But all and all, white folks, den was de really happy days for us\r\nniggers. Course we didn't hab de 'vantages dat we has now, but dere wus\r\nsomp'n' back dere dat we ain't got now, an' dat's secu'aty. Yassuh, we\r\nhad somebody to go to when we was in trouble. We had a Massa dat would\r\nfight fo' us an' help us an' laugh wid us an' cry wid us. We had a\r\nMistis dat would nuss us when we was sick, an' comfort us when we hadda\r\nbe punished. I sometimes wish I could be back on de ole place. I kin see\r\nde cool-house now packed wid fresh butter an' milk an' cream. I can see\r\nde spring down amongst de willows an' de water a trickling down between\r\nlittle rocks. I can hear de turkeys a gobblin' in de yard and de\r\nchickens a runnin' aroun' in de sun, an' shufflin' in de dus'. I can see\r\nde bend in de creek jus' below our house, an' de cows as dey come to\r\ndrink in de shallow water an' gits dere feets cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nicey Pugh, Prichard, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, white folks, you ain't neber seed nothin' lak it so you can't\r\ntell de joy you gits f'um lookin' for dewberries an' a-huntin' guinea\r\npigs, an' settin' in de shade of a peach tree, reachin' up an' pullin'\r\noff a ripe peach and eatin' it slow.

Poole_\r\n\r\n_SATAN'S GOIN' 'ROUND WID HIS TAIL CURLED UP_\r\n\r\nSally Reynolds, living at 552 South Conception street, was busy at the\r\nwash tub when the writer called to interview her on July 20, 1937, so it\r\nbeing a hot day we decided to continue our conversation out doors under\r\nthe washshed amid a conglomeration of tubs, buckets, empty boxes, etc.\r\n\r\nSallie said she was born in Hiltown, Georgia, where her mother Margaret\r\nOwens was a slave and the cook on the plantation of Mr. Lit Albritton.\r\nWhen Sallie was about three years of age her mother gave her to Mrs.\r\nBecke Albritton, who lived at New Providence, near Rutledge in Crenshaw\r\nCounty, Alabama, to whom she was bound until 21 years of age. There was\r\nalso a brother given by her mother to some folks in Florida and of whom\r\nSallie never had any knowledge whatever.\r\n\r\nSallie said Mrs. Albritton was kind to her, taught her to spin and sew,\r\nand she tried to learn herself to weave, but, somehow, could never\r\nmaster it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Albritton had only a few slaves who were named, Mose, Dan, Charles,\r\nSandy (the latter so called because he ate sand as a child), and two\r\nwomen, Hannah and Tene.\r\n\r\nThey had no regular quarters but just cabins out in a rear lot.\r\n\r\nSallie said all the whippings were given by either of the young Messrs.\r\nAlbritton, they were high tempered, as their father was before them. She\r\nlaughed and said she had Indian blood in her veins and sometimes she was\r\nsassy as she felt independent knowing Mrs. Albritton would always take\r\nher part.\r\n\r\nShe recalled the Yankee's coming through after the war, one remained at\r\nthe Albritton home after the others had gone on, and she remembered\r\nhearing Mrs. Albritton telling friends who visited her, that after this\r\nsoldier had left he wrote Mrs. Albritton a letter, telling her to look\r\non the back of the bench on the gallery where he had sat and she would\r\nfind his message. Sallie said she was a little girl sitting on the floor\r\nat her mistress feet, ready to fetch and carry for her and she often\r\nwondered but didn't dare ask what the message was; she did, however,\r\nhear some one say that the Yankees said, if they ever came again, they\r\nwould take them from the cradle and that puzzled her, to know just what\r\nthey meant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Albritton had a regular herb garden and Sallie helped her to gather\r\nthe herbs, Pennyroil, Dock Sage, Tansy (single and double), Thyme, and\r\nYarrow. They used Samson Snake Root in whiskey for cramps, and Butterfly\r\nweed for risings.\r\n\r\nThe writer asked Sallie about church and she said they had no church but\r\nMr. Albritton talked to her and impressed on her as a child to never\r\ntouch anything that did not belong to her. \"Ask for it and if not given\r\nto her, to let it alone and to never lie, or to carry tales, and she\r\ncould always keep out of trouble.\" Sallie said she hated to see Sunday\r\nmorning come, as the men folks were around the house and they would pick\r\non her and somehow she would get a beating.\r\n\r\nSallie remained with Mrs. Albritton until she was 22 years, when she\r\nmarried John Russell, by whom she had three children. They all died as\r\nbabies, later she married Gus Reynolds, (now dead) so Sallie just rents\r\na room and lives alone.\r\n\r\nSallie says present generation knows too much and too little, that the\r\n\"Old-time religion\" was best for all, she thinks \"Satan's goin' 'round\r\nwid his tail curled up, catching all he can devour\"; and \"folks should\r\ndo like Christ did when Satan tried to tempt Him, and tell Satan to go\r\nget behind them, and they get behind Jesus they could not have sorrow\r\nrun across their hearts and minds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Rice\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Mary Rice*\r\n    --_Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula]_\r\n\r\n_DESE UPPITY NIGGERS_\r\n\r\nFew of the ex-slaves will readily admit that they were mere field hands\r\nin the old days. Generally they prefer to leave the impression that they\r\nwere house servants, or at least stable boys or dairy hands.\r\n\r\nBut \"aunt\" Mary Rice, age 92, who lives in Eufaula, holds no such view\r\nabout the superior social position of house servants. She was a \"big\r\nmissy gal\" ('teen age) during the War, and about her duties on the\r\nplantation of Dr. Cullen Battle near Tuskegee, where she was born, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Honey, I lived in de quahter. I was a fiel' nigger, but when I was a\r\nlil' gal, I helped around de milk-house, churnin', washing de pails and\r\nde lak, and den give all de little niggers milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mary Rice, Eufaula, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Massa Cullen and Mistis' Ma'y Jane was de bes' Marster and Mistis' in\r\nde worl'.

Poole, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_JABBO EXPLAINS HIS BLACK SKIN_\r\n\r\nLiving on the Moffat road at Orchard, in western Mobile County, Alabama,\r\non Mr. McIntyre's place is Gus Rogers, who is known better by the name\r\nof Jabbo. He claims to be over ninety years of age, but could give no\r\nproof. He claims the 26th of June as his birthday.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how old he was, he replied with a smile:\r\n\r\n\"Miss, I don't know but I found everything here when I came along.\"\r\n\r\nHe was born at Salisbury, N.C. on the Rogers' plantation, and Mr. John\r\nand Mrs. Mary Rogers were his master and mistress. His parents were\r\nWilliam and Lucy Rogers, who had five children, three girls and two\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nJabbo said the Rogers's home was built of boards of virgin timber and\r\nthe slave quarters were some distance from the big house. Some of the\r\ncabins were built of logs and some of boards, all having clay chimneys\r\nand big open fireplaces equipped for cooking, as the slaves usually\r\ncooked their own meals, except during busy seasons, when meals were\r\nprepared in the house kitchen by the slave women too old to work in the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nJabbo said one old man went around and rapped on the doors to wake up\r\nslaves to go to work. When asked how long they worked he laughed, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Just from sun to sun and then you went to bed, 'cause you knew that old\r\nman would sure be rapping before you were ready next morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about earning any money, Jabbo said:\r\n\r\n\"Law, Miss we didn't even know what money was, and we didn't have no use\r\nfor it. We had all we needed, plenty to eat and all the clothes\r\nnecessary those days.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rogers raised lots of tobacco and wheat, and all the necessary farm\r\nproducts needed on the plantation. They had a large orchard and made all\r\nthe cider they could drink.\r\n\r\nJabbo recalled driving many a refugee wagon during the War, and when\r\nthey heard of the Yankees' coming, the Rogers family took all the horses\r\nand mules and hid them in the swamps and buried all the silver and other\r\nvaluables.\r\n\r\nAfter the devastation wrought by War, Mr. Rogers moved his family to\r\nMassey Station, Montgomery County, Alabama, intending to raise cotton.\r\nHe brought Jabbo's father and mother and family with him, but meeting\r\nwith little success he returned to Salisbury, N.C. Jabbo remained in\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\nJabbo married and raised a family of five children. There were two girls\r\nand three boys but he has no knowledge of their present whereabouts.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he was married more than once, Jabbo laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss I always had the price of a marriage license in my pocket, but\r\nsomehow I never married.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to inquiry as to religion, Jabbo replied:\r\n\r\n\"Miss, I am a Methodist, but there's only one religion. You have to be\r\npure in heart to see Him, because He said so, and to do unto others as\r\nyou desire others to do unto you.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing about religion Jabbo said:\r\n\r\n\"God gave it to Adam and took it away from Adam and gave it to Noah, and\r\nyou know, Miss, Noah had three sons, and when Noah got drunk on wine,\r\none of his sons laughed at him, and the other two took a sheet and\r\nwalked backwards and threw it over Noah. Noah told the one who laughed,\r\n'you children will be hewers of wood and drawers of water for the\r\nother's two children, and they will be known by their hair and their\r\nskin being dark,' so, Miss, there we are, and that is the way God meant\r\nus to be. We have always had to follow the white folks and do what we\r\nsaw them do, and that's all there is to it. You just can't get away from\r\nwhat the Lord said.\"\r\n\r\nJabbo said he would like \"to go back to the good old days, 'though there\r\nwas good folks and there was mean folks, then too, just like there is\r\ntoday.\"\r\n\r\nBibliography: Personal interview by the writer with Gus Rogers,\r\nex-slave, better known as \"Jabbo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJanie Scott\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Personal interview with Janie Scott*\r\n    *255 South Lawrence Street, Mobile, Alabama*\r\n    --_Mary A. Poole, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_SLAVE CA'LINE SOLD FER A SACK O' SALT_\r\n\r\nJanie Scott, living in a cottage at 255 South Lawrence Street, was\r\ninterviewed by the writer on July 14th, 1937. She claimed she was born\r\nApril 10, 1867, but she appeared older than seventy years of age. She,\r\nof course, was unable to give any experiences of her own as a slave but\r\nrecalled what had been told her by her mother, who was a slave on the\r\nMyers plantation at Tensaw, Alabama.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how large was the plantation, Janie answered:\r\n\r\n\"Lordy, chile, many an acre an 'bout sixty slaves.\"\r\n\r\nHer mother worked in the house, and when the field hands were working\r\nhelped carry water out to them in buckets, each one getting a swallow or\r\ntwo a piece. Her father was Andy White, and was raised on the plantation\r\nof John Jewett at Stockton, Alabama.\r\n\r\nJanie had heard her father say he was a coachman and drove the folks\r\naround, also came over in a boat with his master to Mobile to get\r\nsupplies and groceries, and that they killed many a deer in\r\nneighborhoods just north of Bienville Square.\r\n\r\nJane said her mother's Master and Mistress didn't want her mother to\r\nmarry Andy, because he was too light in color and light niggers Janie\r\nsaid folks didn't think as strong as a good black one, so her mother,\r\nSarah Porter, and Andy White her father just borrowed a mule without the\r\nMaster's consent and rode off and were married, anyhow.\r\n\r\nJanie laughed and said she guessed it was all right after all because\r\nthey had eleven children, two are now living, Janie and a sister Daisy.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer asked if slaves ever earned any money, she replied:\r\n\r\n\"They didn't even know what money was.\" Then she continued: \"Once when\r\nmy mother was a little girl she asked her mistress to give her fifteen\r\ncents, and her Mistress wanted to know why she wanted fifteen cents. Her\r\nMother replied: \"I wants to see what money looks like.\"\r\n\r\nHer Mistress thought she was trying to act smart and in place of fifteen\r\ncents she received a whipping.\r\n\r\nThe slaves wore homespun clothes, but her mother remembered having as\r\nher best dress one made of marino.\r\n\r\nThe slaves quarters were log cabins with clay chimneys, and they cooked\r\nin the open fireplaces in the winter and in the summer on what they\r\ncalled scaffolds, built out in the yard. These were made of clay\r\nfoundations with iron rods across on which the pots hung.\r\n\r\nJanie said her mother \"was strong and could roll and cut logs like a\r\nman, and was much of a woman.\" Then they had a log rolling on a\r\nplantation the Negroes from the neighboring plantations came and worked\r\ntogether until all the jobs were completed.\r\n\r\nAfter each log rolling they gave them molasses to make candy and have a\r\nbig frolic.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War when supplies were scarce, especially salt, Marster\r\nJohn rode off taking her mother's sister Ca'line with him, and when he\r\nreturned alone his wife, Mrs. Meyers, wanted to know where was Ca'line,\r\nand Marster John replied: \"I sold her for a sack of salt.\" At first they\r\ndid not believe him, but Ca'line never returned and Sarah never saw her\r\nsister anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter the Surrender the Yankees came through and the slaves hid under\r\nthe house, but the soldiers made them come out and told them they were\r\nfree, and gave the slaves everything on the place to eat. They all went\r\ndown to the creek and praised God for what he had done for them.\r\n\r\nJanie does not believe in charms, hoodoo or fortune-tellers, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Those folks can't tell you nothing. When Christ was risen He carried\r\nall prophets with Him and didn't leave any wise folks able to tell\r\nthings going to happen here on earth--everything Christ wanted folks to\r\nknow had already happened.\"\r\n\r\nJanie did say the best charm she knew of was a bag of asafetida worn\r\naround the neck to ward off sickness or to take nine or ten drops in a\r\nlittle water would sure keep the worms down.\r\n\r\nThe slaves got plenty of coons, rabbits and bear meat, and could go\r\nfishing on Sundays, as well as turtle hunting.\r\n\r\nThe overseer on the Myers plantation was not a mean man, they had a\r\ncalaboose or sweat box to punish unruly slaves in place of whipping\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter the Surrender her father and mother moved to Mobile, Alabama, and\r\nher father continued to work for Mr. Jewett at his mill located at the\r\nfoot of Palmetto Street on the Mobile river front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaugan Shepherd\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Maugan Shepherd*\r\n    --_Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula]_\r\n\r\n_SLAVERY COMING BACK?

She is about 70 and\r\nmakes her living washing clothes for \"de white peoples.\" They never had\r\nany children.\r\n\r\nMaugan says he never goes anywhere except to church on Sundays. His legs\r\nare not so strong anymore, he explains.\r\n\r\n\"My ol' 'oman, she sho' lak to go to funerals,\" he chuckled. \"But in\r\ndese days day takes de body to have it vulcanized, so we can't have no\r\nsettin' ups.

He was not old enough to make a work-hand at\r\nits close. He spoke slowly, but with evident positiveness as to the\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\n\"I 'members lots 'bout slavery times; 'cause I was right dar. I don't\r\n'member much 'bout de war, 'cause I was too little to know what war was,\r\nand de most I seed was when de Yankees come through and burnt up de Big\r\nHouse, de barns, de ginhouse and took all Old Marster's hosses and\r\nmules, and kilt de milk-cows for beef.

Though he\r\nis a \"war veter'n\" with bullets in his side and leg and his century of\r\nlife has enfeebled him, he roams the countryside about Uniontown\r\ncontinually, \"settin' a spell\" with his acquaintances.\r\n\r\nIt was only after several trips I finally caught him \"settin',\" and he\r\nshowed no inclination to move from his advantageous position near a\r\nwatermelon patch. He was industriously working on a huge slice of melon,\r\nhis face buried in the sweet fruit, as I drove up to the little cabin\r\nwhere he was visiting.\r\n\r\nAs the car came to a stop he raised his head and wiped his dripping chin\r\non his sleeve. He called to a little Negro girl in the yard, \"Gal, go\r\nbring de white lady a rockin' cheer\", and turning to me he said, \"You'll\r\n'scuse me for not gittin' up lak I ain't got no manners, won't you\r\nMistess? I got a misery in my laig; you know de one whar I got shot in\r\nde war.\"\r\n\r\nThe rocking chair was brought out and taking a seat nearby I said,\r\n\"Uncle John, I want you to tell me all about yourself, were you in the\r\nwar and are you really a hundred and three years old?\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad to, glad to mistess, but fust don't you want a watermillon?\" He\r\npointed to a patch nearby where the melons glistened in the sun. \"Dis\r\nJuly sun make de juice so sweet you'll smack yo' mouf for mo',\" and\r\nsearching the rind to see that he had left none of the juicy red meat,\r\nUncle John began his story.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I been livin' 'roun' dese parts 'bout ninety year. I was born\r\nsomewar in North Ca'lina, I don't 'member much 'bout my Mammy an' Pappy\r\n'cause I was took 'way from dem by de speckerlaters when I was 'bout\r\nthirteen year ole. De speckerlaters raised Niggers to sell. Dey would\r\nfeed 'em up an' git 'em fat and slick and make money on 'em. I was sold\r\noff de block in 'Speckerlater's Grove' in North Ca'lina. De fus' day I\r\nwas put up I didn't sold, but de nex' day I brung a thousand dollars.\r\nMr. Saddler Smith from Selma bought me. Dey called him Saddler Smith\r\ncause he was in de saddle business and made saddles for de army. Dey\r\nfotch us down on boats. I 'member de song de men on de boat singed.

He didn't had many niggers, but\r\nhe sho' tuck good keer o' dem what he did had. He didn't 'low nobody to\r\nhit 'em a lick. Sometime when I would git cotch up wid in some diverment\r\nde white folks would say, 'Whose nigger is you?\" and I say, 'Marse\r\nSaddler Smith.' Den dey look at each oder an' say kinder low, 'Better\r\nnot do nothin' to ole Smith's nigger. He'll raise de debil.'\r\n\r\n\"I didn't had no mistiss. My marster was a widder. He raised me up\r\nworkin' 'roun' de saddle shop. I ain't never liked to work nowhow, but\r\ndon't tell nobody dat. I was bout twenty seven year ole when de war\r\nbroke out. De ole uns was called out fust and de young uns stayed home\r\nand practiced so dey could shoot straight an' kill a Yankee. Us\r\npracticed every Friday evenin'.

I was\r\nmovin' de hawses to de back of de lines out de thick of de fight when,\r\nzipp, a minit ball cotch me right in de shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nProudly John displayed the balls in his side and the scar on his leg.\r\nThe old woman, at whose cabin John was visiting, interrupted the story\r\nseveral times. Finally he got tired of it and said: \"Shet yo' mouf\r\n'oman, I don't need no ho'p, dis is grown folks talk, you don't know\r\nnothin' 'bout it, you wasn't even birthed tell two year 'fo' de\r\nSurrender.

I looked and\r\nlooked for him but I never did find him. Atter I lost my marster I\r\ndidn't 'long to nobody and de Yankee's was takin' eve'y thing anyhow, so\r\ndey tuck me wid dem.\r\n\r\n\"I tuck keer of Gen'l Wilson's hawse, Gen'l Wilson was de head man in de\r\nYankee army. But I didn't lak dey ways much. He wanted his hawse kep'\r\nspick and span. He would take his white pocket hankercher an' rub over\r\nde hawse and if it was dirty he had me whupped. I was wid Gen'l Wilson\r\nwhen he tuck Selma 'gins't Gen'l Forrest and sot fire to all dem things.\r\nI drive de artillery wagon sometime. Atter Surrender I was kinda puny\r\nwid de balls in my side.\"\r\n\r\n\"John,\" I asked, \"why didn't they remove the balls at the time you were\r\nshot?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could dey 'move de balls when I was runnin' fast as I could pick up\r\nmy foots? I driv de stagecoach twixt Selma and Montgomery. I 'member my\r\nstops. Dey was Selma, Benton, Lown'esboro and Mon'gomery. I driv four\r\nhawses to it. Dere was a libbery stable at Benton and I changed hawses\r\ndere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now John tell me about your wife and children,\" I said. \"How many\r\nchildren did you have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gawd, I don't know mistess.

She said \"Sumtimes\r\nI now starts tuh do dumpin' an' fogits what I wants tuh do, den I ahs\r\ntuh go bac' tuh de place whar I started from so I kin 'member whats I\r\nstarted tuh do\".\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Annie\" was born on Knight's Place on the Alabama River, June 2nd.,\r\n1853. This place is now known as Finchburg, in Monroe County, Alabama.\r\nHer mother's name was Mary Knight and her father's name was Atlas\r\nWilliams, who had the same name as his owner, Mr. Offord Williams. \"Aunt\r\nAnnie's\" mother's people were owned first by Mr. Cullen Knight and after\r\nhis death, were owned by Mr. John Marshall.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Annie\" was seven years old then the Civil War started, and that\r\nshe had \"nursed two cullered chillun afore de war.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked by the writer about nursing these children, so as to be sure\r\nshe said colored children, she replied, \"dat de slaves lived on de\r\nplantation, and dey had an overseer who libed on dis place, an' she\r\nneber seed de Marshall's place 'til after dey was freed.

Honey, folks talkin' 'bout depression now\r\ndon't kno' nothin' 'bout hard times. In dem days folks didn't hab\r\nnothin' 'ceptin' what dey made. Eben if yo' had a mint ob money, dere\r\nwas nothin' to buy. We made de candles to burn by tying strings on the\r\nstick and puttin' dem down in melted tallow in moulds. In dem times we\r\nhad no matches, folks made fire by strikin' flint rocks together an' de\r\nfire droppin' on cotton. I don't know whether dese rocks were ones dat\r\nde Indians lef' or no, but day was dif'rent from other rocks. People\r\nusta carry dem an' de cotton roun' in boxes sumtin lak snuff boxes tuh\r\nkeep de cotton dry.

De rations for a week\r\nwas 3 lbs of meat a week, 1 peck ob meal, potatoes an' syrup. At\r\nChristmas times de overseer called all de men an' women in an' gib each\r\nwoman a dress, a head handkerchief, an' tuh de men he gave a hat, knife,\r\nan' a bottle of whiskey.

Prine, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_A SLAVE IS GIVEN HIS YOUNG MISSY'S NAME_\r\n\r\nA tall, stoop-shouldered, black Negro man came trudging down the road\r\nwith a hoe in his hand. Asked where Cull Taylor lived, the old man said,\r\n\"Lady I'se Cull Taylor. Dis is mah house here. Does you want to see me?\"\r\n\r\nWhen told that his visitor was looking for old people who lived during\r\nslavery days Cull said:\r\n\r\n\"I were born a slave, but warn't very old when de niggers was freed. I\r\nwere born March 5, 1859, in Augusta County, Alabama. Mah maw come from\r\nRichmond, Virginia and her name were Jane Hare. Mah paw's name were\r\nWillingham Hare, and he were brought to Alabama from North Carolina. I\r\nguess you'se wonderin' why mah name is Taylor when mah maws and paws\r\nname was Hare?\r\n\r\n\"You see when dey was fust brought here, a man name Tom Taylor bought\r\n'em, an' when I were born, dey gib me to Miss Bennie Taylor. Ol' Marse\r\nTom's girl. Miss Bennie gib me de name Taylor an' I'se allus kept hit.\r\nShe shorely was good to me. I neber had nothing much to do, I stayed wid\r\nher, 'til I was grown, atter she married Mr. Bob Alexander.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout de war, I does 'member how mah maw was a-weavin' cloth when de\r\nYankees come through. An' atter de niggers was freed ol' Marse Tom gib\r\nmah maw de loom.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' Marse was a good man. He neber 'lowed no o'seer or anybody to\r\nmistreat his niggers. He had plenty of 'em, too, and a big plantation\r\nwid plenty to eat. Course de slaves had to work on de plantation an'\r\nraise de stuff to eat. His house was a big fine, white place, an' de\r\ncabins whar de slaves libed was built in rows, wid streets between dem,\r\nso you could drive 'tween 'em wid big double team wagons. De cabins was\r\nbuilt out ob logs wid a notch out in de shoulders, an' laid on top ob\r\none another an' when dey built de wall up as high as dey wanted hit, dey\r\nwould bore a augor hole an' put a pin in hit to hold 'em together. Den\r\ndey put de roof on. Dey filled de cracks between de logs wid mortar, so\r\nas to keep de wind out, an' it sho' made de houses warm. Us had jes'\r\nwooden home-made beds, wid mattresses made of cotton, or moss, an'\r\nsometimes hay. Us neber hab no springs on de beds.\r\n\r\n\"As I said, Ol' Marse Tom was a good man, an' he was too old to go to de\r\nwar, but he had two boys. De oldest one went to de war an' was killed.\r\nBut de youngest warn't old enough to go. Ol' Marse Tom had de women sew,\r\nmakin' clothes, an' had nurse women to look atter de little niggers\r\nwhile dere maws was in de fields. I 'members as a li'l boy how dey had\r\none house whar de nurse kept de chillun an' it was as clean as a pin.\r\nDere was wooden troughs different heights for de different age chillun,\r\nan' dose troughs was scrubbed as white as cotton mos'. When meal time\r\ncome, dey would crumble up cornbread wid pot licker, or milk an' gib to\r\nde youngest ones. An' dey had plenty ob milk, I 'members de big milk\r\ndairy, an' smoke house on de place, an' when de Yankees come through dey\r\nwent into de dairy an' drank all de milk dey wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members mah paw was out in de woods hidin' de mules when dey come\r\nthrough an' dere was only one old horse on de place. Dem Yankees turn\r\nhit loose, but otherwise dey behaved very nice.\"\r\n\r\nCull said that they didn't know anything about dishes and spoons such as\r\nare used now, for they had wooden spoons for the slaves. He said that\r\nthe usual rations for a week included a peck of meal, and six or seven\r\npounds of meat to each man, and if he had a big family he was given\r\nmore. They raised rice, sugar cane, pumpkins, watermelons, cushaws,\r\npeaches, pears, plums and grapes.\r\n\r\n\"Mah white folks not only tuk keer ob us durin' slavery times, but dey\r\ngib us things atter us was freed. You ax me 'bout de slaves clothes?\r\nYas'm, lady, us had good, stout, clothes, made out ob de cloth dat de\r\nwomen wove. I can see mah maw throwing dat ol' shickle from one side to\r\nde other, weaving cloth on dat loom. Dey dyed de cloth wid red oaks an'\r\ndogwood bark, and Chinaberry bark, and had all kinds ob colors, sich as\r\nblue, red, brown, and black.\r\n\r\n\"Den dere was de big times, sich as de hog killin' time, an' corn\r\nshucking, an' 'specially cotton pickin' time. Sometimes de neighboring\r\nplantation would hab a regular cotton pickin' festival, an' all ob us\r\nwould go and he'p pick de cotton, and de nigger what would pick de mos'\r\nwould git a dress or de men would git a suit ob clothes. De suits was\r\nmade out ob osnaburg, and sometimes bed tickin'. When a big crowd would\r\ncome to dese cotton pickin's, dey would pick out three or four bales ob\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\n\"De li'l niggers had a good time playin' in de sand makin' frog houses,\r\nan' spinnin' tops. But, Lordy! when us got sick, dey gib us Jerusalem\r\noak and sassafras tea. But neber was dere anything said 'bout hoo-doo\r\nstuf. I never heard ob hit, 'til dese later years.\r\n\r\n\"But us did hab church, an' prayer meetin', an' funerals! Lor', yes, dey\r\ndon't bury folks now. In dose days dey started singin' at de house an'\r\nsung all de way to de graveyard; an' den dey put dem in de groun' good\r\nfull six feet deep, dey jes' lays folks on top ob de groun' now-a-days.\r\nBut times is different now, lady.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members how de men would go out nights an' hunt de possums an' de\r\ncoons, and wild cats. Dey den would sometimes go deer an' rabbit huntin'\r\nin de daytime; an', too, dey would set traps to ketch other varmints.\r\nDere was plenty ob squirrels too.\r\n\r\n\"But let me tell you, de bes' thing ob all, was de good locust beer, dey\r\nmade from locust seeds. Dey also made 'simmon beer, an' wine out ob\r\nplums. Dem war good days den.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Taylor\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Daniel Taylor*\r\n    *Montgomery, Alabama*\r\n    --_John Proctor Mills, Montgomery, Alabama_\r\n\r\nForeword:--In Uncle Daniel Taylor we find the unusual, fast disappearing\r\ntype of negro ex-slave (it makes the sentimental white man feel a deep\r\nsadness in the passing of these gentle old souls, whose lives have been\r\nwell spent in serving to the best of their ability.) Uncle Dan is a\r\nlight complected mulatto (octoroon) with a high and broad forehead (a\r\nnoble brow) devoid of all negroid features, a heavy suit of silk-like\r\nhair almost free of any kinks, a heavy suit of gray beard (it is in the\r\nshort kinky hair next to his throat that the negro stands out most\r\nprominently) a fine moustache which matches the snowy silkiness of his\r\nhair up on his head. Deep set, dark blue-grey eyes which beam with\r\nkindliness, wide apart and far-searching. A voice well modulated and\r\nrefined in timbre, of tenor quality. Uncle Dan has been so closely\r\nassociated with the educated white man of the South until he uses no\r\nnegro dialect, but his speech is that of one who has tried at all times\r\nto speak correctly and deliberately. He has served as janitor at nearly\r\nall of the Public Schools of the Montgomery City Schools system, and for\r\nfifteen years or more has been at the Baldwin High School; is janitor at\r\nthis school at present (May 1937) where he is highly respected, and\r\ngreatly beloved by the student body and members of the large faculty.\r\n\r\n\"Strange to say, I do not remember the name of my first master, nor of\r\nthe second master to whom my Mother and myself were sold to in Alabama.\r\nI was born at Charleston, South Carolina, and at the age of two and a\r\nhalf years we landed at Luverne, Ala., where with my Mother I was sold\r\nfor four-hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\"I was fourteen years old at the time of the 'Surrender,' and was living\r\nat old 'Rocky Mount' in Crenshaw County, at the time of the 'Civil War.'\r\nProfessor Mack Barnes of Highland Home, Alabama, was the first man I\r\never worked for, and he, as you know, was at the head of the large\r\nschool located in Highland Home.\r\n\r\n\"The hottest moments of my life were the ones in which my Mother got\r\ntight in behind me with a hickory (switch) and I always took to the\r\nwoods. I'll just bet that I knew and could tell more about the woods and\r\nthe cane-brake than anyone in that section. Yes sir! I knew every\r\nvarmint that crawled on its belly, and all the rest which went on four\r\nfeet, that lived there. Believe me, I knew every one of them by name and\r\nright where they stayed.\r\n\r\n\"The hot moments just mentioned usually found me 'cooling off' in the\r\ncreek in the old swimmin' hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Daniel Taylor, Montgomery, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Among the thrilling moments of my life well do I remember the visits of\r\nPresident Jefferson Davis, (the first and only President of the\r\nConfederate States of America) to the home of my Master. Mr. Davis\r\nalways gave me a quarter of a dollar for holding his horse, and up 'til\r\nlately I had one of those quarters as a highly valued keep-sake, but it\r\nsuddenly disappeared, I know not where.\r\n\r\n\"The most exciting moments of my whole life was when the Herron Street\r\nSchool (at present the Cottage Hill School) caught fire and burned to\r\nthe ground. We had marched all of the children out of the building to\r\nsafety (you see we had all had disciplined fire drills) but Professor\r\nCharles L. Floyd (Superintendent of the Montgomery Public Schools) was\r\nmindful lest there should still be one person left in the building, so\r\nhastened back into the rapidly burning building. He just wouldn't listen\r\nto the pleadings of Miss Jinny (Miss Virginia Hereford, who was the\r\nPrincipal of this school) nor to Miss Sophy (Miss Sophia Holmes) a\r\nteacher at the primary department, nor would he listen to my humble\r\nplea. The roof was already tumbling in, and the blazing rafters were\r\nfalling in every direction. I could stand it no longer, so rushed right\r\nthrough the smoke and flames, finally I found Mr. Floyd and dragged him\r\nout to safety. My God! I loved that white man, he was one of the finest\r\nmen I ever knew!\r\n\r\n\"No! Mister John, I have never sought a 'heroe's medal for bravery and\r\nfor risking my life', my one great reward was in the saving of the life\r\nof my true friend Professor Charles L. Floyd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Taylor\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Personal interview with George Taylor*\r\n    *409 South Hamilton Street, Mobile, Alabama*\r\n    --_Ila B. Prine, Mobile, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_CHILLUN WAS TAUGHT TO BE MANNERABLE_\r\n\r\nGeorge Taylor, an old and very black man, who lives at 409 South\r\nHamilton street in Mobile, says he is an ex-slave. He knows that he was\r\nborn in Mobile on the corner of Cedar and Texas streets, but left\r\nMobile, and was carried to Gosport, Alabama, when he was twelve years\r\nold. His father's name was Gus Taylor and his mother's Sarah Taylor, and\r\nthey were owned by Mr. W.G. Herrin. There were twenty-one children in\r\nGeorge's family, and he said he was the oldest one, and helped \"nuss de\r\nodders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mah grandfather's name was Mac Wilson an' mah grandmother's name was\r\nEllen Wilson, an' de ol' Miss's name was Miss Mamie Herrin. All de\r\ncolored folks' chillun called Mr. Herrin 'Cl' Marster, an' he sho' was a\r\ngood marster, too. I 'members dat atter I got to be a big boy dey put me\r\nin de fiel's choppin' cotton, but I neber could pick cotton. I knows dat\r\nmah paw said I was too crazy 'bout de girls, so he tuk me an' made me\r\nplow.\r\n\r\n\"Ol' marster had a big place, I don't jes' exactly knows how many acres\r\ndey was, but I knows us had plenty ob cotton, 'ca'se sometimes dey would\r\npick four or five bales a day. An' den I knows durin' cotton time mah\r\npaw hauled cotton all day long to de gin whut was run by five or six\r\nmules.\r\n\r\n\"Durin' de busy season on de plantation ol' Marster had de older women\r\ncookin' an' sendin' de dinner to de fiel'. Dere was two big baskets, one\r\nto put de bread in, an' de odder basket to put de meat in. Every mornin'\r\nat three o'clock de women begun cookin' an' each han' brought his own\r\nmeat an' bread to this cabin to be cooked. Every person's plate had\r\ntheir names on 'em. Ever'body had to be up by daylight an' ready to\r\nbegin work. De men had to get up before daylight an' begin to harness de\r\nmules, an' soon as light dey was in de fiel's. Dere was two hundred and\r\nfifty head ob colored people, 'scusing chillun. Dey would raise four,\r\nfive, and six hundred bales ob cotton, a year. Us worked den, dere\r\nwarn't no walkin' 'bout den, not eben on Sat'day atternoons, but I\r\nbelieves I'd lack it betta dan I does now, 'cause de chillun was taught\r\nto be mannerable den, but now dey cuss if you say anything to dem.\r\n\r\n\"Us had a good place to stay, de ol' Marster's house was a big two-story\r\nhouse, an' our cabins was built ob boards an' was in a row. Us didn't\r\nhab no stoves, jes' cooked out in de yard ober a fire wid stakes on each\r\nside of hit, wid an' iron bar across 'em to hang de pots on. Ol' Marster\r\nrationed out de food, an' each man was 'lowed seven pounds ob meat, de\r\nwomen was 'lowed six pounds an' five pounds for each child. Den dey gib\r\nus a peck ob meal, five pounds of flour and some molasses.\r\n\r\n\"I neber did eat at home wid mah folks, 'ca'se I nussed in de big house,\r\nan' ebery time dat de white chillun eat, I had to eat, too. Dere was\r\nplenty ob pecan, walnut, an' ches'nut trees on de place, an' us could\r\neat all de nuts we wanted; and den de slaves had dere own gardens if dey\r\nwanted to.\r\n\r\n\"Den I 'members how dere was four men who put de hogs in de pens to\r\nfatten, sometimes, dey would put as many as a hundred or a hundred an'\r\nfifty at a time. Den hit was dere duty to tote feed from de fiel's to\r\nfeed 'em.\r\n\r\n\"My! when I think ob dat big smoke house, mah mouth jes' waters. At hog\r\nkillin' time, dere was certain men to kill, an' certain ones to cut 'em\r\nup. Dere warn't neber no special time to hog killin', jes' when de ol'\r\nMarster said do hit, we did hit.\r\n\r\n\"You see us was allus under his direction, 'ca'se if us wanted to go\r\nanywhere, us had to git a pass, eben to church. De white folks had\r\nMethodist church, an' de collored had de Baptist church.\r\n\r\n\"I also 'members de time I was put up on de block to be sold, an' when\r\nde man only offered five hundred dollars, fer me, an' Ol' Marster tole\r\nme to git down, dat I was de mos' valuable nigger he had, 'ca'se I was\r\nso strong, an' could do so muck work.\r\n\r\n\"Mah maw was de weaver, an' dere was a woman named Assella who did de\r\ndyeing. Mah paw gathered de bark, sich as red oak, elm, maple and\r\njuniper bark, an' dry hit an' den grin' hit up. Dey also used borax,\r\nalum and blue stone, to set de dye. De women made de clothes out ob dis\r\ncloth dat was woven on de place.\r\n\r\n\"You axed 'bout weddin's. Us didn't hab weddin's lack us do now. De way\r\nus married would be to go to de big house, an' ol' Marster had us to\r\njump over a broom stick, an' den us was considered married. But dere was\r\none thing dat us warn't 'lowed to do, an' dat was to abuse or cuss our\r\nwives, an' you betta not strike 'em, ca'se hit would be jes' too bad.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Miss, I'se been here a long time. I 'members when dere was\r\nonly one house 'tween St. Louis Street an' Frascati, an' dat was de\r\nGuard House. I also 'members de ole time remedies dat dey used in de ole\r\ndays. Dey used red oak bark for fever an' colds, an' den dere was\r\nhoarhound, an' black snake root dat de ol' Marster put whiskey on. Ol'\r\nMarster made his own whiskey. An' oh! yes, de calomus root growed in de\r\nwoods whar dey lived. I neber seed dem send to no store for medicine. I\r\nneber hyeard ob no hoodoo stuff, 'till I was grown, an' anudder thing\r\nfolks didn't die of lack dey do now. When any one did die, dey allus had\r\na big funeral, an' de men would sometimes hitch up a ox team or mule\r\nteams, an' as many as could git in would go. De coffins was home made\r\nan' stained. Dere was plenty ob han's to dig de graves, too.\r\n\r\n\"I'se tell you, Miss, folks is pretty much de same, if de white folks\r\ntreat de niggers right, you couldn't get dem to leave dem. I 'members\r\nwhen de Yankees come through, I was standin' on de Ol' Marster's porch,\r\nan' I seed dem comming, an' Marster got up on his crutch an' go to de\r\nsteps an' invite dem in, an' believe me dey come in, too. Dey jes'\r\nnatcherly tore up ol' Marster's place; then de furniture all 'roun' an'\r\nbroke heaps ob hit. I knows b'fore dey got dere ol' Marster had mah paw,\r\nan' Jerry Lee, an' Mace Pouncey, an' anudder man take four barrels ob\r\nmoney an' carry down to de spring an' put hit in de spring, an' I'se\r\ntellin' you, Miss, you couldn't any more git near dat spring, dan\r\nnothin', ca'se de quicksan' made dem barrels boil up, one at a time, an'\r\nde way dey had to git dem barrels, was to buil' a scaffold from de\r\nriver, an' let a line down an' ketch aroun' dem barrels.\r\n\r\n\"Atter we was freed, Ol' Marster come out in de yard an' got in de\r\nmiddle ob all ob us, an' tole us dat de ones dat wants to stay wid him,\r\nto stan' on one side, an' de odders to stan' on de odder side. So mah\r\npaw got on de side wid dose who wanted to leave, an' us lef' Ol' Marster\r\nan' paddled down de river, in a paddlin' boat to Belle's Landing.\r\n\r\n\"As I'se said before, I'se been here a long time, I eben 'members seeing\r\nJeff Davis. I knows I ain't here for long, but I'se ready, 'ca'se I'se\r\nbeen fightin' for Jesus twenty-nine years, an' I ain't tired ob fightin'\r\nyet.

Prine_\r\n\r\nAmanda Tellis, a tall, thin, light lulatto woman, who was born a slave\r\nNovember 30, 1854, lives in Allenville, a negro settlement about four\r\nmiles north of Mobile, Alabama.\r\n\r\nAmanda's father was a spaniard, whose name was John Quick, and her\r\nmother's name was Sallie Pugh, her mother having the same name as the\r\npeople who owned her. Sallie, Amanda's mother, was born a slave in\r\nCharleston South Carolina, and she and her mother were brought to\r\nAlabama and sold when Sallie was twelve years old. The mother was sold\r\nto someone in Demopolis, Alabama, while Sallie was sold to the Pugh\r\nfamily in Grove Hill, Alabama.\r\n\r\nAmanda was born in Grove Hill, Alabama and Mr. Meredith Pugh was her\r\nmaster, and Mrs. Fannie Pugh was her mistress. Her young \"Missus\" was\r\nMiss Maria Pugh, a daughter, one of seven children in the Pugh family.\r\nAmanda said she willed to \"Miss Maria\" and she nursed and took care of\r\nher until the surrender. Many times when Amanda would be promised a\r\nwhipping for not doing things as she should have, Miss Maria would save\r\nher from the whipping, by throwing herself back from the table and\r\nscreaming for them not to touch Amanda, her nurse.\r\n\r\nAside from caring for \"Miss Maria\", Amanda said she spun three cuts of\r\nthread a day, and when the writer asked what a cut was, she said: \"A cut\r\nwas a broach full.\" During the war, (meaning the Civil War,) Amanda said\r\nshe and her sister Nancy spun 160 yards of cloth, and they finished the\r\nlast on the day of the Surrender, when the Cannons were fired at Fort\r\nMorgan, and they were mustering the men out.\r\n\r\nAmanda's life was a very easy one in comparison to some of the other\r\nslaves. She said she had seen many of the slaves cruelly mistreated, but\r\nher people were fortunate in having a good master and mistress.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the close of the war, Amanda was told to pretend she had a\r\nchill, and go to her mother's cabin, so she did as she was told. When\r\nshe reached the cabin, her mother, brothers and sisters each had a\r\npillow slip, filled with clothes and she was given hers and they ran\r\naway, and came to Mt. Vernon, Alabama. Amanda was only eleven years old\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nHer life has been varied since, having married three times. Her first\r\nhusband was Scott Johnson, and was the father of all of her children,\r\nseven boys and one girl. Amanda lives with this girl now. Her second\r\nhusband was Vance Stokes, and her third was S.T. Tellis, a negro\r\nMethodist preacher. Amanda said he was \"no count and I did not stay with\r\nhim long.\"\r\n\r\nAmanda is now confined to her bed and has been for the past seven weeks,\r\nher body has wasted away, until she is skin and bones. Her eyes however\r\nare still bright and keen, her hair snow white and she still has a few\r\nteeth. Her mind seems to be clear, and her memory good, in fact the past\r\nis now a part of her, and she told the writer she was so happy because\r\nshe had come to ask her about it, before it was too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEllen Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Ellen Thomas*\r\n    --_Mary A. Poole, Mobile_\r\n\r\n_TABLE SERVICE AS TAUGHT TO AUNT ELLEN_\r\n\r\nIn a little cottage at 310 Wienacker Avenue, in the western part of\r\nMobile, lives Ellen Thomas, who claims to be 89 years old. She is small\r\nof stature, dark brown in color, with high cheek bones and small regular\r\nfeatures. Although she wears the old-fashioned bandana handkerchief\r\nbound about her head, the story of 'Aunt' Ellen is unusual, in that\r\nhaving been raised as a house servant in a cultured Southern family, she\r\nabsorbed or was trained in the use of correct speech, and does not\r\nemploy the dialect common to Negroes of the slavery days.\r\n\r\n'Aunt' Ellen was born in Mobile. Her mother, Emeline, was a dwarf who\r\nwas brought from St. Louis to Mobile by a slave-trader. When put up for\r\nsale, her deformity enlisted the sympathy of Judge F.G. Kimball, who\r\nbought her and brought her to his home on Dauphin Street, between\r\nHallett Street and Georgia Avenue. Later, Sam Brown, a free Negro from\r\nthe West Indies, came to Mobile and, wanting Emeline for his wife,\r\nagreed to pay Judge Kimball for her, giving himself as security. Sam and\r\nEmeline had only two children, Pedro and Ellen, both born on Judge\r\nKimball's place and raised in his home as house servants, having little\r\ncontact with the field slaves.\r\n\r\nIn her childhood, Ellen had as her special mistress Miss Cornelia, one\r\nof the Kimball girls, who trained her in the arts of good housekeeping,\r\nincluding fine sewing, which was itself an art among the women of that\r\nperiod. Ellen relates with much pride, her ability to put in tucks and\r\nback-stitch them in the front of men's shirts, to equal the best machine\r\nwork of the present day. Although hampered by failing eyesight in recent\r\nyears, her work with the needle today is proof that her claims are not\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nIn all her experience as a slave, she recalls but one whipping. This was\r\nwith a small switch in the hands of Judge Kimball. The cause? She\r\nanswered: \"I ain't coming,\" when he called her; and at his second call,\r\nshe said: \"I shan't do it.\" She was seven years old at the time.\r\n\r\nJudge Kimball insisted that the house servants use good English, she\r\nsaid. Thus brought up as a child among the Kimball children, and because\r\nof her duties as a house servant, she mingled little with the field\r\nhands and acquired none of their dialect. Even her long association with\r\nfree Negroes since the war, has failed to eradicate early impressions\r\nand practices in the use of words, and she stresses this in conversation\r\nwith educated white persons.\r\n\r\nBecause she was a house servant, Ellen was accorded many privileges not\r\nenjoyed by ordinary slaves. Good food, neat clothing and cleanliness of\r\nperson were requirements rigidly enforced. As personal maid to young\r\ngirls little older than herself, her lot was quiet and the association\r\ndeveloped a devotion and friendship that was lifelong. Among the\r\nprivileges that fell to her as a child, she recalls that of accompanying\r\nthe family on carriage rides--usually seated beside the driver to the\r\nenvy of her little mistress on the more dignified inside seat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ellen Thomas, Mobile, Alabama_]\r\n\r\nHer training as a house servant was very broad and involved every\r\nfeature of a well kept household of that period. She has especial pride\r\nin her ability to serve at table, particularly when there were guests\r\npresent. A feature of the training given her and which Ellen says she\r\nnever knew of anyone else receiving was, after being taught to set the\r\ndining table complete for guests, she would be blindfolded and then told\r\nto go through the motions of serving and so learn to do so without\r\ndisturbing anything on the table. So proficient did she become in\r\nserving, that a few times when they had guests, Judge Kimball would for\r\ntheir amusement have Ellen blindfolded and direct her to serve the\r\ndinner. In passing dishes a small silver tray was used.\r\n\r\nEllen said that they tried to teach her brother Pedro to serve the table\r\nlikewise; but his natural clumsiness prevented. He could never learn.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, she said, her master had an immense pit dug near the\r\nhouse, put his cotton in the pit and built the woodpile over it. The\r\nFederal invaders never found it.\r\n\r\nJudge Kimball owned extensive tracts of land above Mobile and used a\r\nlarge number of his slaves to cut timber for wood and lumber; hewn\r\ntimber being largely used for house-building. He built a house for every\r\none of his children, from his own timber, and even had his own coffin\r\nmade from home-grown cedar. Ellen failed to follow this act of her\r\nmaster with approval, judging from her tone in speaking of it.\r\n\r\nShe remembers the Surrender and the incidents accompanying that event.\r\nShe was seventeen years old. Thus she describes the first visit\r\nafterward of the enemy. \"I was helping to cook breakfast one morning,\r\nfrying codfish and potatoes, when I heard a drum and ran to tell Master.\r\nHe jumped up and said: 'It's the Yankees! Tell Pedro to get a sheet and\r\nhang it out in front.' Pedro was excited and, instead of getting a\r\nsheet, got one of Mistress' best table cloths and hung it from a big oak\r\ntree near the front gate. When the Yankees rode up, they dismounted and\r\nMaster invited them in for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the Yankee Lieutenants asked her name, and she told him: \"Ellen\r\nBrown.\" He looked puzzled at her answer, knowing her master's name to be\r\nKimball. (Since her father was a free man, 'Aunt' Ellen said that she\r\nand her brother, Pedro, always retained their own name, instead of\r\n\"Kimball.\") The lieutenant then said: \"All right, Ellen, bring me a\r\nglass of milk at thirteen o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nShe went to her little mistress, and asked her \"what that old lieutenant\r\nmeant by 'thirteen o'clock.'\" Miss Cornelia laughed and said he meant\r\n\"one o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n'Aunt' Ellen related how Judge Kimball was always teaching them and gave\r\nthem regular lectures. She particularly remembers one of his sayings:\r\n\"You can never swing on yellow pine tree, as it is tender and pliable.\"\r\n\r\nShe remained with the Kimballs three years after the war, worked for\r\nother families a short time and then married Amos Thomas when she was\r\nabout twenty years old. They had a very large family, eleven girls and\r\nnine boys. She now has great-grandchildren who are married.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is little doubt that her age is approximately what she\r\nclaims, 'Aunt' Ellen is remarkably well preserved, physically and\r\nmentally. Her activity and industry would not be inappropriate to a\r\nwoman a score of years younger. Unlike many persons of her years she\r\ndoes not constantly look forward to her time of departure, but takes\r\nlife as it comes--caring more for today than for tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Elizabeth Thomas*\r\n    --_Montgomery_\r\n\r\n_HID THINGS THEY AIN'T NEVER FOUND_\r\n\r\nElizabeth Thomas who lives at 2 Eugene Street, Montgomery, Alabama stuck\r\nup one finger when asked her age. That meant 100 she said. She is\r\ntypical the oldtime Negro with head rag tightly covering her hair,\r\ncarrying a slick old walking-stick whose bark is worn in places because\r\nof constant use, and little old straightcut full apron. Her memory is\r\nnot clear but her hearing is perfect.\r\n\r\nShe stated--\r\n\r\n\"I lived mighty fine in dem days, I tel' you. Mister Ben Martin Jones\r\nwas my Marster, and I was born on de Red Bridge Road. I was a house\r\nservant. All our clo'es was made at de quarters. My Mammy made mine an'\r\nall I wanted, too. I useter hear my mammy say, de patteroles (patrols)\r\nwould git us ef we done wrong but I didn't know nothin' 'bout\r\npatteroles, 'cause dey wasn't none on our place.

Why, I 'members when de 'mancipation come as if 't'was\r\nyestidy.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Mollie recalls that she was born on a plantation near Rome,\r\nGeorgia, and that her owners were Dan and Lucy Phillips.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Dan was a Baptis' preacher,\" she explained, \"an' he shorely was a\r\ngood man. He was a chaplain in de big war and he didn't get hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Marster owned lots an' lots of slaves an' de plantation was jes' full\r\no' niggers.

Well, atter dat he didn' come no mo'.\r\n\r\n\"I waited an' I watched, but I didn' hear nuffin of dat nigger. Atter\r\n'while I got worried. I was 'fraid de patterollers done kotch him, or\r\nmaybe he done foun' some gal he lak better dan he do me. So I begin to\r\n'quire 'bout him an' foun' dat his marster done sol' him to a white man\r\nwhut tuck him 'way down yonder to Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"Well ma'am, I grieved fo' dat nigger so dat my heart was heavy in my\r\nbreas'. I knowed I never would see him no mo'. Soon atter dat, peace was\r\n'clared an' de niggers was free to go whar dey pleased.\r\n\r\n\"My folks stayed on wid Marse Dan fer a year; den dey 'cided to go to\r\nAlabama an' farm. We hit it off to Alabama an' I begin to go 'bout some\r\nwid de young bucks.

We jes' tuck up whar we lef' off\r\nan' 'fo' long us got married.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, Aunt Mollie continued, they lived happily until his death about 20\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nShe now lives in Uniontown, happy and contented. She has her garden and\r\nflowers; but emphasizes that \"de ol' days was de bes' of all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlonza Fantroy Toombs\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Alonza Fantroy Toombs*\r\n    --_Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula?]_\r\n\r\n_HE BELONGED TO BOB TOOMBS OF GEORGIA_\r\n\r\n\"Missy,\" said Alonza Fantroy Toombs, \"I'se de proudest nigger in de\r\nworl', 'caze I was a slave belonging to Marse Robert Toombs of Georgia;\r\nde grandest man dat ever lived, next to Jesus Christ.

My pappy was a\r\npreacher an' Marse Bob learnt him to read and write, an' would let him\r\ngo f'um plantation to plantation on de Sabbath Day a-preachin' de\r\ngospel.

Shelby, Jr., Tuscumbia, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_DIS WAS DAT LONG AGO_\r\n\r\n\"It's been so long sence, I don' 'member much,\" William Henry (Bill)\r\nTowns said talking of slavery days. Towns was only seven when the Civil\r\nWar began and his memories are those of childhood, which he mixes with\r\nreminiscences and opinions of the older slaves with whom he came in\r\ncontact immediately after the war. Towns knows the exact date of his\r\nbirth. He says:\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Tuscumbia, Alabama, December 7, 1854. My mother was name\r\nJane Smoots. She come from Baltimore, Maryland. My father's name was Joe\r\nTowns, and he come from Huntsville, Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"I had a passel of brudders an' sisters; Charlie and Bob was my\r\nbrudders; Betty, Kate, Lula an' Nelie was my sisters. Dere wasn't but\r\ntwo of us endurin' slavery. Dat was me an' Nelie; de rest was born atter\r\nslavery. Me an' Nelie was Townses, the rest, Charlie, Kate, Lula, Bob\r\nand Betty was Joneses. How dat come 'bout was dis away. Endurin' slavery\r\nmy father was sold to anudder slave owner. Atter de war my mother\r\nmarried Frank Jones; den dese yuther chillun was born.\r\n\r\n\"It done been so long sence all of dis was I disremembers most 'bout it.\r\nAnyway, the Big House was a two-story house; white like mos' houses\r\nendurin' dat time. On the north side of the Big House set a great, big\r\nbarn, where all de stock an' stuff dat was raised was kep'. Off to de\r\nsouthwes' of de barn an' wes' of de Big House set 'bout five or six log\r\nhouses. These house was built facin' a space of ground in de center of a\r\nsqua'e what de houses made. Anybody could stan' in his front do' an' see\r\nin at the front of de yuther houses.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes enduring' de week an' on Sunday, too, de people would git\r\ntogether out in dis squa'e an' talk 'fore goin' to bed. The chillun what\r\nwas too young to work was always out in de front playin'. Jes' acrost\r\nfrom our place was anudder wid de quarters built 'mos' de same as ourn\r\n'ceptin' dat dey had a picket fence 'roun' de quarters to pervent 'em\r\nfrom runnin' away. 'Course Mr. Young didn't have to worry 'bout his\r\nhan's runnin' away, cause he wan't a mean man like some of de slave\r\nholders was. He never spoke harsh or whupped 'em, an' he didn't 'low\r\nnobody else to do it neither.\r\n\r\n\"I remember one day a fellow come from acrost on anudder farm an' spoke\r\nsumpin' 'bout Mr. Young bein' too easy wid his servants. He said, 'Them\r\ndarn niggers will think they is good as you iffen you keep up de rate\r\nyou goin' now, Young.' Mr. Young just up an' told him if he ever spoke\r\nlike dat again he'd call his bluff. Mr. Young told him de he didn't work\r\nhis people like dey was oxes.\r\n\r\n\"All of Mr. Young's hands liked him 'cause he didn't make 'em sleep on\r\ncorn shuck mattresses an' he didn't have dey meals cooked in a wash pot.\r\nA lot of de yuther slaves didn't know what it was to eat meat, lessen it\r\nwas a holiday. Mr. Young 'lowed his people to eat just what he eat. I\r\nhear my mother tell a tale 'bout a man what took a meat skin an' whipped\r\nhis chillun's mouth wid it to fool folks like dey had some meat for\r\ndinner. Ole Caleb told one a lil' bit bigger'n dat, though. He said one\r\nnight him an' a feller was comin' from prayer meeting an' they runned\r\n'crost a possum settin' in de root of a tree by de side of de road. He\r\nsay he stopped to git him an' dis yuther feller told him he wouldn't\r\nbother wid him 'cause he wouldn't git none of him no how. Caleb ast him\r\nwhy he said that. He said, ''Cause your ole master is gwine take him\r\njes' soon as you git home wid him.' Caleb told him dat Mr. Young wasn't\r\ndat kin'er man. De yuther feller ho'ped Caleb to ketch dat possum, an'\r\nhe got a piece of him de nex' night when ever'body come in from de\r\nfiel'. Caleb said de ol' feller enj'yed de meat so much dat he wished he\r\ntook him an' his family de 'hole possum.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't live so far from Big Spring Creek. 'Co'se, we didn't do no\r\nfishin', 'cause we younguns had to 'tend gaps to keep de cattle off'n de\r\ncrops. De grownups had to go to de fiel'. Life was kin'er happy durin'\r\nslavery 'cause we never knowed nothing 'bout any yuther sort of life or\r\nfreedom. All we knowed was work from one en' of de year to de yuther,\r\n'ceptin' on holidays. Den we'd have to go to church or set around de\r\nfire an' lis'en to de old folks tell stories. The grownups would go to a\r\ndance or do sumpin' else for indertainment. Co'se us younguns got a heap\r\nof pleasure outten dem fairy tales dat was tol' us by de older ones. I\r\nknow ma an' dem use to tell some of de awf'lest tales sometimes. I'd be\r\n'fraid to go from one part of de house to de yuther widoutten somebody\r\nwid me. Us younguns would had to play some sort of a game for\r\nindertainment. Dere was a whole lot of games an' riddles to be played\r\ndem days. It have been so long sence I played any of 'em I'se mos' near\r\ndisremembers de biggest part of 'em. I 'members a song or two an' a few\r\nriddles what ol' Caleb use to tell us. De song goes sumpin' like dis:\r\n\r\n    Saturday night an' Sunday, too.\r\n      Had a yaller gal on my mind.\r\n    Monday mornin', break of day,\r\n      White folks had me gwine.\r\n\r\n\"De riddles was like dis;\r\n\r\n    Slick as a mole, black as a coal,\r\n    Got a great long tail like a thunder hole.\r\n    (Skillet)\r\n\r\n    Crooked as a rainbow, teeth lak a cat,\r\n    Guess all of your life but you can't guess dat.\r\n    (black berry bush)\r\n\r\n    Grows in de winter, dies in de spring,\r\n    Lives wid de root stickin' straight up.\r\n    (icicle)\r\n\r\n\"Dere was anudder song what Caleb use to sing. It goes like dis:\r\n\r\n    Whar you gwine buzzard? Whar you gwine crow?\r\n    Gwine down to de river to do jes' so.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was a whole lot more to dat song what I disremembers.\r\n\r\n\"Anudder song what comes to my min' is:\r\n\r\n    Hawk an' de buzzard went down to de law;\r\n    When de hawk got back he had a broken jaw.\r\n    Lady's pocketbook on de judge's bench\r\n    Haden' had no use for a pocketbook sence.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I visits wid ol' Mingo White an' me an' him talks over dem\r\ndays dat me an' him was boys. We gits to talkin' an' 'fore you knows it\r\nol' Mingo is cryin' lak a baby. 'Cordin' to what he says he is lucky ter\r\nbe a-livin'. Dis is one thing I never likes ter talk 'bout. When slavery\r\nwas goin' on it was all right for me 'cause I never had it hard, but it\r\njes' wan't right to treat human bein's dat way. If we hadn't a-had to\r\nwork an' slave for nothin' we might have somepin' to show for what we\r\ndid do, an' wouldn't have to live from pillar to pos' now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _William Henry Towns, [TR: Tuscumbia?], Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Speakin' of clothin', everything that we wore back den was made by\r\nhan'. Many a night my ma use' to set an' spin wid a spindle. I have set\r\nan' done the cardin' for her so she could git her tas' done. In de\r\nsummer we would wear un'erwear what was made outten cotton. In de winter\r\nit was made outten flannel. De shoes was made of cowhide what was tanned\r\nright dere on de place. Dem was de hardes' shoes I ever seen. Sometimes\r\ndey'd wear out 'fore dey was any ways soft, an' den sometimes atter dey\r\nwas wore out you couldn't hardly ben' 'em. Some of de han's would go\r\nbar'footed until de fall an' den wear shoes. Slippers wan't wore den. De\r\nfust pair of slippers I ever 'members havin' was de ones what I bought\r\nfor my weddin'. Dey didn't cos' but a dollar an' six bits. My weddin'\r\nsuit didn't cos' but eight dollars, an' a straw hat to match it cos' six\r\nbits.\r\n\r\n\"As I said afore, Massa Young an' ol' Mistis was mighty good folks on\r\n'count of dey never whupped any of they han's. Iffen dere was one dat\r\nwould give trouble dey would git rid of him. De overseers had to be kin'\r\nto de hands or else he was outten a job. De chillun was mighty nice,\r\ntoo. Ever' time dey went to town or to de sto' dey would bring us\r\nyounguns some candy or somepin'. Joinin' our farm was a farm whar de\r\nslaves fared lak dogs. Dey was always beatin' on some of dem.\r\n\r\n\"Ever'body worked hard enduring' dat time. Dat was all we thought we was\r\n'spose' to do, but Abe Lincoln taught us better'n dat. Some say dat Abe\r\nwan't intrusted so much in freein' de slaves as he was in savin' de\r\nunion. Don' make no diff'ence iffen he wan't intrusted in de black\r\nfolks, he sho' done a big thing by tryin' to save de union. Some of de\r\nslaveholders would double de proportion of work so as to git to whip 'em\r\nwhen night come. I heard my ma say after slavery that dey jes' whipped\r\nde slaves so much to keep dem cowed down an' 'cause dey might have\r\nfought for freedom much sooner'n it did come.\r\n\r\n\"Caleb come from N'Orleans, Louiseanner. He say dat many a day ship\r\nloads of slaves was unloaded dere an' sold to de one offerin' de mos'\r\nmoney for dem. Dey had big chains an' shackles on dem to keep 'em from\r\ngittin' away. Sometime dey would have to go a long ways to git to de\r\nfarm. Dey would go in a wagon or on hoss back.\r\n\r\n\"Talk 'bout learnin' to read an' 'rite--why, iffen we so much as spoke\r\nof learnin' to read an' 'rite we was scolded like de debil. Iffen we was\r\ncaught lookin' in a book we was treated same as iffen we had killed\r\nsomebody. A servant bett'nt be caught lookin' in a book; didn't make no\r\ndiff'ence if you wan't doin' nothin' but lookin' at de pictures.\r\n\r\n\"Speakin' of church; we went to de same church as de white folks did;\r\nonly thing was we had to go in de evenin' atter de white folks. De white\r\nfolks would go along an' read de Bible for de preacher, an' to keep dem\r\nfrom talkin of things dat might help dem to git free. Dey would sing\r\nsongs like 'Steal Away,' 'Been Toilin' at the Hill So Long,' an'\r\n'Old-Time Religion.'\r\n\r\n\"Ever' once in a while slaves would run away to de North. Mos' times dey\r\nwas caught an' brought back. Sometimes dey would git desp'rit an' would\r\nkill demse'ves 'fore dey would stand to be brought back. One time dat I\r\nheard of a slave that had 'scaped and when dey tried to ketch him he\r\njumped in de creek an' drown hisse'f. He was brought from over in\r\nGeo'gia. He hadn't been in Alabama long 'fore him an' two more tried to\r\n'scape; two of 'em was caught an' brought back but dis yuther one went\r\nto de lan' of sweet dreams.\r\n\r\n\"After de day's work was done an' all had eat, de slaves had to go to\r\nbed. Mos' slaves worked on Sat'day jes' lak dey did on Monday; that was\r\nfrom kin' to caught, or from sun to sun. Mr. Young never worked his\r\nslaves 'twell dark on Sat'day. He always let 'em quit 'roun' fo' 'clock.\r\nWe would spen' dis time washin' an' bathin' to git ready for church on\r\nSunday. Speakin' of holidays; de han's celebrated ever' holiday dat deir\r\nwhite folks celebrated. Dere wan't much to do for indertainment,\r\n'ceptin' what I'se already said. Ever' Christmas we'd go to de Big House\r\nan' git our present, 'cause ol' Mistis always give us one.\r\n\r\n\"Slaves never got sick much, but when dey did dey got de bes'. Dere was\r\nalways a nurse on de farm, and when a slave got sick dey was righ' dere\r\nto give dem treatments. Back in dose days dey used all sorts of roots\r\nand yarbs for medicine. Peach tree leaves was one of de mos' of'en.\r\nSassafras was anudder what was used of'en; hit was used mostly in de\r\nspring made in tea. Asafetida was anudder what was use to keep you from\r\nhavin' azma. Hit was wore 'round de neck in a lil bag. Prickler ash was\r\nanudder what was tooken in de spring. Hit was 'spose ter clean de blood.\r\nSome of de folks would use brass, copper an' dimes wid holes in 'em to\r\nkeep from havin' their rumertiz.\r\n\r\n\"I was seben years old when de war commence. I 'members Mrs. Young said\r\nwhen de Yankees come dey was goin' to ast us iffen dey had been good to\r\nus. She said dat dey was goin' to ast us all 'bout how much money dey\r\nhad; an' how many slaves what dey owned. She told us to say dey was po'\r\nfolks an' dat dey didn't have no money. I 'member my mother said dat she\r\nhoped Mr. Young and dem to hide deir money som'ers in a well dat wan't\r\nbein' used 'cause it gone dry. Dem Yankees sho' did clean up whar they\r\nwent along. Dey would ketch chickens by de bunches and kill 'em an' den\r\nturn 'roun' an' make de ol' Mistis clean 'em an' cook 'em for dem. Dem\r\nYankees set fire to bales an' bales of cotton. Dey took de white folks\r\nclo'se an' did away wid 'em. Sometimes dey would tear 'em up or give dem\r\nto de slaves to wear. De war ended in sixty-five an' I was eleben years\r\nol' den.\r\n\r\n\"Jes' atter de war we was turned loose to go for ourse'f. What I mean by\r\ndat, we was free. I didn't mean that we lef' Mr. Young's 'cause we\r\nstayed wid him for de longest atter slavery was over.\r\n\r\n\"My fust work was in a blacksmith shop down on West Six Street. I worked\r\nfor fifty cents a day den until I learned de trade. Atter I worked at de\r\nblacksmith shop for about two years I took up carpenter work. I served\r\napprentice for three years. I followed carpent'ing the res' of my life.\r\n\r\n\"I married Lizzie Anderson when I was twenty-one years ol'. She wan't\r\nbut seventeen years ol'. We didn't have no big weddin', we jes' had de\r\nfambly dere. I raised ten chillun up until April de twenty fourth.\r\nThat's when William Henry died. My chilluns doin' pretty well in life.\r\nDere's two of my sons what's doctors; one is a carpenter. The other one\r\nis Grand Orator of the Shriners. My gals is doin' fine, too. Three of\r\n'em is been school teachers, one a beauty cult'ist an' de other one a\r\nnurse. I feels sati'fied 'bout my chillun now. Dey seems to be able to\r\nmake a livin' for they se'ves pretty well.\r\n\r\n\"I thinks that Abe Lincoln was a mighty fine man even if he was tryin'\r\nto save their union. I don't like to talk 'bout this that have done\r\nhappened. It done passed so I don't say much 'bout it, specially de\r\nPresidents, 'cause it might cause a 'sturbance right now. All men means\r\nwell, but some of 'em ain't broadminded 'nough to do anythin' for nobody\r\nbut themse'fs. Any man that tries to help humanity is a good man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStepney Underwood\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Stepney Underwood*\r\n    --_John Morgan Smith_\r\n\r\n_THE COURT JESTER_\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, I was a slave. I was tin year' old whin de war begin.\" Uncle\r\nStepney spoke the words between intermittent jerks of an uncontrollable\r\nvoice.

Lawrence street, Mobile, Ala.*\r\n    --_Written by Mary A. Poole_\r\n\r\n_IT TOOK $50.00 TO PUT UNCLE CHARLIE ON DE FLOOR!_\r\n\r\nAn old colored man, named Charlie Van Dyke, living at 713 S. Lawrence\r\nstreet, Mobile, Ala. claims to be 107 years old, but he has no authentic\r\nrecord of his birth. He told the writer he was born in North Carolina,\r\nand when he was ten years old, Mr. William Martee King, who owned his\r\nmother, \"Nellie Drish\", moved to Tuscaloosa, Ala., where the King family\r\nremained about a year, moving then from Tuscaloosa down into Dallas\r\nCounty, near Selma, Ala.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. and Mrs. King and their family remained in Tuscaloosa,\r\nCharlies mother Nellie Drish met and married William Van Dyke, who\r\nbelonged to the Van Dykes, who owned the neighboring plantation.\r\n\r\nCharlie assumed his step-father's name, but knew little of him, or of\r\nthe Van Dykes to whom his step-father belonged, because, as Charlie\r\nexplained to the writer, after the Kings moved down in Dallas County,\r\n(as Charlie always referred to his home in Alabama) and brought his\r\nmother Nellie and her family with them, his stepfather could only visit\r\nthem once a year, and that privilege was given him on Christmas Day. He\r\nhad to start back the next day, as he had to make the trip to and fro on\r\nhorse back.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie said the Kings owned about a thousand acres in Dallas\r\nCounty and had about a hundred head of slaves, but with all their riches\r\nthey lived in a plain plank house.\r\n\r\nHe smiled and said, \"Now-a-days folks passing such a house, would say\r\n'Colored folks live there.'\"\r\n\r\nThe slave quarters were the regular log wood cabins, said Uncle Charlie,\r\nwith space between each row and a little plot of ground to separate each\r\ncabin to itself.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie said his mother cooked for the white folks, and sometimes\r\nshe didn't get down to their cabin but on Sunday afternoon, that he\r\nbeing the oldest had to look after the younger children, and that he was\r\nnever required to do heavy work as he broke his leg when a boy, so the\r\nfolks let him just work around the yard and look after his sisters and\r\nbrothers and also the other slave children.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie said Mr. King traveled a lot, went to France once, that\r\ntook almost a year and the overseer had full charge and he was mean and\r\nmade everybody stand around. He even made the slaves shuck corn on\r\nSundays, each had their allotted amount to shuck before they could stop.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer asked about church on the plantation, Uncle Charlie\r\nreplied: \"Church was what they called it but all that preacher talked\r\nabout was for us slaves to obey our masters and not to lie and steal.\r\nNothing about Jesus was ever said, and the overseer stood there to see\r\nthe preacher talked as he wanted him to talk.\"\r\n\r\nThe only day that Uncle Charlie said they were given any real holiday\r\nwas Christmas, everybody got his drink of whiskey on Christmas, and not\r\nanother drink until next Christmas, \"it sure seemed a long time between\r\ndrinks\", added Charlie with a smile.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie said they did let you have a funeral when some one died,\r\nthey made the coffin on the plantation and carried it by hand to the\r\ngraveyard, singing as they went along. He tried to recall the hymns, but\r\nall he could chant in a sing-song way was,\r\n\r\n    Last word he said was about Jerusalem\r\n    And he traveled along to the grave!\r\n\r\nWhen asked about war days, Uncle Charlie was first on the Confederate\r\nside, then on the Northern side, and he seemed somewhat bewildered about\r\nit all, he said he saw a stockade, as he called it, in Selma, Ala., and\r\nhe remembered food stuff being sent to the soldiers, and also recalled\r\nthe Yankees coming, and a Captain coming up the road and telling them\r\nthe soldiers were coming. Uncle Charlie said the colored folks thought\r\nthe Captain had to go back North before they came back, but in a flash\r\nlike lightening there they were, hundreds of them, and they scared folks\r\nso bad some of them jumped in the river and tried to swim across and\r\nthose that couldn't, they just drowned.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer tried to check up on Uncle Charlie's age, asking him how\r\nold he was when the war started, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I dont know but I was a man long afore it all started, lady, and I was\r\nthirty-three years old when I married 'bout a year after the surrender.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked why he waited so long to get married, Uncle Charlie said:\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you know in slavery days they wouldn't alow a man to marry\r\nunless he could split a hundred rails a day?\"\r\n\r\nThe writer smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Uncle Charlie,\" and then he chuckled, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess the right one didn't come 'long till I met her.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he had a regular wedding feast, he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, lady, it took $50.00 to put me on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nCharlie and Theresa had \"five head of children\", as Uncle Charlie\r\nexpressed it, of which three are dead and two living, but he claims his\r\nchildren do not look after him, but his church folks and friends give\r\nhim the helping hand. He is a member of the St. Luke Missionary Baptist\r\nChurch, of Mobile.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie says he has his religion from the foregone prophets, that\r\nhe \"don't understand this day religion\", that he came along when people\r\nwere serving Daniel's God, and when people had to be born again, now\r\nthey serve a sanctified God and jump from one religion to another.\r\n\r\nUncle Charlie finished the interview by saying, \"Lord teach me how to\r\npray, And teach me to love it woo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLilah Walker\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Lilah Walker*\r\n    --_William B. Strickland, Carbon Hill_\r\n\r\n_I HEAR DE WHIRRIN' OF QUARE WINGS_\r\n\r\nI walked through a small glade overshadowed by large oak trees, near\r\nCarbon Hill in Walker County, Alabama. A weird little cabin confronted\r\nme; its porch and steps loosely held to the main part of the structure\r\nby a few weak boards. Lilah Walker, an old Negro woman, squatted on the\r\nsteps with her chin resting in her black hands, in an attitude of deep\r\nreverie. As the old woman heard me approaching she raised her head in\r\ncordial greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, young marster,\" she said. \"How is you today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine, Aunt Lilah,\" I answered. 'How's the world treating you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can't complain,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nThe old woman continued.\r\n\r\n\"It mought be safer to set inside, 'case dey says when de sun swing low\r\nlak dis dat de miassahs whut make you sick 'gin to rise outten yon'\r\nswamp.\" Then she chuckled: \"I bin here since 'fo' de wah, an' I ain't\r\nneber seen no miassahs rise outten dat swamp yit. Yassuh, dat sho is so,\r\nbut from whut I seed rise outten it my 'pinion is dat dey done lef' long\r\n'fo' dis. But I seed quare wings whirrin' outten dat swamp jus' 'fo'\r\ndays atter de surrender, an' I seed 'em near 'bout eve'y day since. I\r\nseed 'em an' I heered 'em jus' a whirrin'!\r\n\r\n\"Nawsuh, I sho can't 'splain de wings, but I is got my 'pinion how come\r\ndey is. When I tells you whut took place here durin' dem dark ole days,\r\nden maybe you'll hab yourn. Ole Mistis died 'fo de war, an' ole Massa,\r\nhe too ole to go. He didn't do nothin' but set aroun' an' read de books\r\nan' papers. 'Peer lak to me he jus' plum forgit 'bout young Mistis after\r\nher mammy died, an' de little gal jus' growed up lak a wild flower in de\r\nwoods, cep'n for a handsome young boy on de nex' plantation. Dey was\r\nnearly always together.\r\n\r\n\"By an' by de boy got ole enough to go to de wah. It was jus' a little\r\nfo' de close. Den young Mistis, she droop an' she droop. 'Reckley she\r\n'gin to swoon, long jus' anywheres she would. One day she swoon an'\r\nnothin' I could do would bring her back to her senses. I jus' couldn't\r\nfetch her to. I call ole Massa an' he git a doctor. Dey putt me outten\r\nde room an' I ain't neber heared whut dat doctor said till yit, but ole\r\nMassa, he go stark wild. He holla an' carry on in his sleep all de\r\nnight; an' de nex' day he druv' de young Mistis away. Dere was a cabin\r\nden in de swamp, an' she went dar to live. I snuk out dar an' tote her\r\nvittles to her fo' days an' days. She always grab me an' say: 'Don't you\r\nlove me an' don't you believe in me, mammy?'\r\n\r\n\"'Co'se I does, honey chile, 'ca'se I useta sing to you 'bout de good\r\nole lan' of promise.' Den I says to her: 'Dese times is powerful\r\ntriflin', an' maybe 'fo' long I's gwine home an' de white folks will\r\nmiss me 'ca'se dey can't raise chilluns.' Den she cry an' I cry.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout dat time de word come of de surrender. Ole Massa seem to come to\r\nhis wits den an' he kep' a close watch on me so's I can't leave de house\r\nto carry de food. On de fo'th day, I cotch a chance an' I snuck off.\r\nWhen I come close to de cabin I call, but young Mistis neber answer. Den\r\nI went to de do', but I neber go in de do', 'ca'se millions of black\r\nwings come a-whirrin' outten de house. I run an' run an' I pray too, but\r\nde big black wings still follow me. Sometimes in de early mornin' I\r\nstill hears an' sees two pairs of wings, sometimes white, sometimes\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, I is aimin' to tell you 'bout ole Massa; whut 'come of him. One\r\nevenin' I ventured to de aidge of dat swamp, an' somep'n cracked under\r\nmy feets. I is jus' about to run when I sees it's jus' a piece of paper.\r\nI sees it has writin' on it so I taken it to ole Massa. Den when he read\r\ndat he sho 'nough go plum crazy. 'Bout dat time dey open what dey called\r\na 'sane 'slylum in Tusaloosy an' dey taken ole Massa dar an' a little\r\nlater he died.\r\n\r\n\"De young boy who went to wah, whut about him? Dey say he was killed in\r\nde las' battle of Appomatox. Dat piece o' paper? Yassuh. It was a paper\r\nsayin' dat young Mistis and de young boy on de nex' plantation was\r\n'nited in ma'iage.

Jordan_\r\n\r\nSoftly mumbling to himself and gravely shaking a bare, shiny head that\r\nhad only a fringe of white, closely-kinked wooly hair about the ears,\r\nthe old Negro shuffled out of the crowded courtroom into the corridor.\r\n\r\nTurning clear, quizzical eyes toward a group of white men loitering near\r\nthe doorway and addressing no one in particular, with a final emphatic\r\nshake of his head he said:\r\n\r\n\"Hit do beat all, de way dese young niggers is allus in trouble wid de\r\nlaw. Now, whin Ah was a young buck de only law mongst us niggers was de\r\nword uv ole Massa.

Barton_\r\n\r\nLittle black Cindy skipped along the narrow path that led to the Spring\r\nHouse. In her hand she swung an empty cedar pail that she was soon to\r\nfill with cool, fresh milk. She entered the small glade overhung with\r\nwillow trees and spread with soft grass, and gazed at the sparkling\r\nwater of the spring as it caught the beams of sunlight coming through\r\nthe trees and reflected them in myriads of little points. Shadows of the\r\nwaving leaves danced over the ground and up the side of the stone Spring\r\nHouse. How cool and nice it was here, she thought. Gentle breezes\r\nrustled the limbs of small saplings and quietly stirred the long grass\r\nalong the upper part of the branch.\r\n\r\nA young rabbit hopped from a little clump of bushes and Cindy watched\r\nhim as the small creature drank thirstily from the crystal water.\r\nOccasionally, the bunny would lift his head as if warned by a slight\r\nsound, but in a moment she saw him fold back his delicate ears and once\r\nmore dip his small mouth into the babbling water.\r\n\r\nAfter quenching his thirst, the rabbit hopped a few feet away and\r\nnibbled on a wisp of tender grass. Cindy was as still as a statue as she\r\nwatched the procedure. \"Dat's de cutest little bunny I ever seed,\" she\r\nsaid to herself. \"I wish I could ketch him.\" But Cindy knew that she\r\ncould not catch a rabbit, so she was content to stand in the shadow of a\r\nsycamore and gaze eagerly at the animal, nibbling the grass.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without warning, Cindy's eyes protruded from their sockets\r\nwith an expression of fear. Slipping noiselessly through the green\r\nundergrowth she saw a giant rattler gliding slowly toward the young\r\nrabbit. She wanted to cry out, but she was afraid; afraid of attracting\r\nthe rattler's attention toward her. She was deathly afraid of snakes.\r\nSince babyhood, she had harbored a growing fear of them. If Cindy had\r\nbeen still before this time, she now became a frozen image. It would not\r\nhave been apparent that she was even breathing. So frightened was she of\r\nthe snake that her whole body broke out in a profuse perspiration. Her\r\neyes were glued to the tremendous brown monster which, without the\r\nslightest sound, oozed deftly toward its victim. Cindy was hypnotized!\r\nThe snake seemed to hold her in a strange spell. Slowly, inexorably he\r\nmoved entirely out of the undergrowth and was now weaving on the clear\r\nground. He approached the rabbit within a distance of three feet and\r\nbegan to carefully form himself in a deadly coil. Cindy saw every\r\nmovement. She saw each diamond on its brown back; each scale of its\r\ncrawling skin; each lash and point of its tongue; the whiteness of its\r\nbreast, the large track that it had made in the sand. She watched its\r\neyes gleam, expressionless and ominous. She gazed at the deadly mouth as\r\nit slowly began to open. She was aware of the first appearance of the\r\ntwo death-like fangs pointing downward. She saw the ten-buttoned rattle\r\nstand erect. She saw it quiver; shake; sound. She saw the rabbit turn\r\nwith fear. She saw the strike; the sinking of the fangs into the soft,\r\nbrown fur. She watched the rabbit give an ephemeral struggle; witnessed\r\nthe brief pitiful look in the bunny's eyes and at last saw the mouth\r\nsink into the small belly and draw the last breath of life away.\r\n\r\nThe experience was more than the little girl could stand. Cindy was now\r\nin a state of frenzy. She could not move, nor speak, nor turn her eyes.\r\nShe could only stare! At what?\r\n\r\nThe monstrous snake then girded himself for further onslaught. After\r\nbeing sure his victim was dead, he loosed his grip and stretched at full\r\nlength upon the ground; drew the rabbit out until it too was stretched\r\ncarefully out with its hind feet together and its head pointing in the\r\nopposite direction. Then followed an experience that to Cindy seemed\r\nentirely impossible. The snake took the hind feet of the rabbit in his\r\nmouth, until gradually they had disappeared. Then came what seemed to\r\n'Cindy an agonized struggle. The snake's mouth stretched almost to the\r\nbreaking point as it began slowly to close over the rest of the rabbit's\r\nrear quarter. With fits and starts and jerks and stretches, the rattler\r\nreeled and squirmed; contorted and wreathed and sucked until the rabbit\r\nhad half gone. With the last great effort the serpent threw himself into\r\nanother series of bodily contortions that seemed to 'Cindy positively\r\nagonizing to him, until at last the rabbit had entirely disappeared from\r\nthe earth. For several minutes 'Cindy apparently watched the tremendous\r\nhump in the snake move slowly backward. With gradually diminishing\r\nintermittent jerks, the snake finally got the small animal to his\r\ndigestive tract. The monster then crawled to a hot sandy section and\r\nwent to sleep.\r\n\r\n                                  ----\r\n\r\nTwo hours later it was twilight. An overseer was walking along the path\r\nto the Spring House. He paused for a moment beneath a sycamore tree to\r\nrest and cool himself. As his eyes roamed the shadowy little glade they\r\ncame to rest on the body of a little Negro girl, lying inert upon the\r\nsoft grass with the handle of a cedar bucket clutched in a death grip.\r\nHe lifted the small black form into his arms and carried her to the\r\nhouse. He saw in her face an expression of mingled agony and fear.\r\n\r\n                                  ----\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, white folks, dat was me,\" Aunt 'Cindy smiled as she told me of\r\nthe experience, 80 years later. \"Dat was de biggest snake I ever seed.\r\nHe musta been seven feet long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cindy Washington, [TR: Eutaw], Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"All dis happen in Sumter County whar I was bawn. Us had a pretty place\r\ndere. I'll never forgits how de niggers worked dere gardens in de\r\nmoonlight. Dere warn't no time in de day. De white folks work tuk dat\r\ntime. De oberseer rung a big bell for us to git up by in de mawnin' at\r\nfo' o'clock, an' de fus' thing we done was to feed de stock.\"\r\n\r\n\"You axe was we punished?\" Yassuh, we was punished for something: most\r\nof all for stealin'.\r\n\r\n\"Yassuh, we was taught to read an' write, but mos' of de slaves didn't\r\nwant to learn. Us little niggers would hide our books under de steps to\r\nkeep f'um havin' to study. Us'd go to church wid de white folks on\r\nSunday and sit in de back, an' den we go home an' eat a big Sunday meal.\r\nWhen we got sick f'um eatin' too much or somp'n, Massa Jim Godfrey was a\r\ndoctor an' he'd ten' to us. Den when new nigger babies came, nine little\r\nblack bugs was tied up in rags 'roun' dere necks for to make de babies\r\nteethe easy. When I was ma'ied, white folks, at de age of thirteen, Alex\r\nWashington, my husband an me had a forty-dollar weddin'. My mistis baked\r\nme a cake, an' a white schoolmaster named Henry Hindron spoke de\r\nceremony. Me an' dat ole husband had twenty-two chilluns.\r\n\r\n\"Yas ma'm. I sho does believe in ghosties.

Ole Massa was name' Billy Jones, and Ole\r\nMistis was name' Angeline. Dey lived in Harris County, Georgia, close to\r\nColumbus. My pappy and mammy was Peter and Frances Jones, and I had a\r\nbrother, Dennis, and a sister, Georgianne.\r\n\r\n\"Massa was a good man, and I did love Ole Mistis. Dey was mighty good to\r\nus niggers; fed us out dey own garden. We had checked homespun clothes\r\nfoh eve'yday, and purty calico and dyed osnaburg ones foh Sunday. I went\r\nto church wid de white folks, settin' in de foot of de carriage. I\r\n'members well de Sunday I fust seen a shoutin'. It was two white ladies.\r\n\r\n\"Massa and Mistis had four chillun. Two of dem, Dave and Quit, was bad\r\nfighting kids. I seen Massa make dem strip to dey waist, and whip 'em,\r\nden make dem go in and bathe.\r\n\r\n\"Massa lived in a big, fine white house. He had two or three hundred\r\nslaves, and de quarters was in two long rows, runnin' up near 'bout to\r\nde big house on de hill. Dey even raised deer on de place. De houses in\r\nde quarters was two-room log houses wid a shed room to cook in. My mammy\r\nwas de cook at de big house, and granny was de weaver. Pappy was de\r\nbedmaker; he made most of de beds outen poplar. I had a little chair in\r\nde corner where I sot and kept de flies offen Mistis wid a green twig\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever Massa sont any de slaves offen de place he had to gib 'em\r\npasses so de patterollers wouldn't ketch 'em and whip 'em foh runnin'\r\naway. De patterollers was a good thing foh de lazy ones. When daylight\r\ncome we had to get up, else we'd be whipped. Massa didn't have his\r\nslaves whipped much; just when dey was lazy and wouldn't work.\r\n\r\n\"Ev'ey now and den we would have some good frolics, mostly on Sattiday\r\nnights. Somebody would play de fiddle and we all danced to de music. De\r\nfolks sure had some big times at de cornshuckin's, too. De men would\r\nwork two or three days, haulin' de corn and pilin' it near de crib. Den\r\ndey would invite folks from other quarters to come and help wid de\r\nshuckin'. While dey shucked dey would holler and sing:\r\n\r\n    You jumped and I jumped;\r\n    Swear, by God you out jumped me.\r\n    Huh! Huh! Round de corn, Sally.\r\n\r\n\"Granny used to give us tea made outen sage roots, mullen, pine,\r\nhoarhound--dat sho' was bitter stuff. We had purty beads made wid corn.\r\nAnd I still 'members de Christmas I got my fust shoes. I just hugged dem\r\ntight and went to sleep holdin' 'em. Dey was button shoes.\r\n\r\n\"When we heard de Yankees was comin' we hid all de meat and rations and\r\nde silver in de big swamp, and turned de horses loose, and all us kids\r\nhid in de bedticks (mattresses). De Yankees stayed around two or three\r\ndays and would pull de hands out of dere beds by dey toes.\r\n\r\n\"But I really seed a ha'nt one time. I knowed it was. De was one old man\r\nbeen havin' de toothache all de time; he used to keep he jaw tied up. I\r\nwas gwine over to see him day time. Well, 'fore I got dere I seen what\r\nlook like him comin'. When I got nearer he turned to a man riding a mule\r\nand wearing a big hat. Den, 'fore he got to de house he was plum gone.\r\nDat's how I knowed it was a ha'nt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMingo White\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Mingo White*\r\n    --_Levi D. Shelby, Jr., Tuscumbia, Alabama_\r\n\r\n_JEFF DAVIS USED TO CAMOUFLAGE HIS HORSE_\r\n\r\nMingo White lives at Burleson in Franklin County, Alabama, and though he\r\ndoesn't know his age he remembers that he was a big boy when the War\r\nbetween the States began. His reminiscences of slavery days, when he was\r\na field hand, are an incongruous combination of stories of severe\r\ncruelty and free Saturday afternoons, Sunday holidays and happy\r\nfestivals of cornshucking and community cotton picking. He talks of\r\npunishments visited on recalcitrant slaves beyond human endurance and of\r\ntasks saddled on one person that would take half a dozen to accomplish.\r\nMingled with these perhaps fogged memories of the nonagenarian are\r\ninteresting sidelights of \"drivers,\" paterollers,\" Ku Kluxers and\r\nshare-cropping in reconstruction days.\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Chester, South Carolina, but I was mos'ly raised in\r\nAlabama,\" Mingo said. \"When I was 'bout fo' or five years old, I was\r\nloaded in a wagon wid a lot mo' people in 'hit. Whar I was boun' I don't\r\nknow. Whatever become of my mammy an' pappy I don' know for a long time.\r\n\r\n\"I was tol' there was a lot of slave speculators in Chester to buy some\r\nslaves for some folks in Alabama. I 'members dat I was took up on a\r\nstan' an' a lot of people come 'roun' an' felt my arms an' legs an'\r\nchist, an' ast me a lot of questions. Befo' we slaves was took to de\r\ntradin' post Ol' Marsa Crawford tol' us to tell eve'ybody what ast us if\r\nwe'd ever been sick to tell 'em dat us'd never been sick in our life. Us\r\nhad to tell 'em all sorts of lies for our Marsa or else take a beatin'.\r\n\r\n\"I was jes' a li'l thang; tooked away from my mammy an' pappy, jes' when\r\nI needed 'em mos'. The only caren' that I had or ever knowed anything\r\n'bout was give to me by a frein' of my pappy. His name was John White.\r\nMy pappy tol' him to take care of me for him. John was a fiddler an'\r\nmany a night I woke up to find myse'f 'sleep 'twix' his legs whilst he\r\nwas playin' for a dance for de white folks. My pappy an' mammy was sold\r\nfrom each yuther too, de same time as I was sold. I use' to wonder if I\r\nhad any brothers or sisters, as I had always wanted some. A few years\r\nlater I foun' out I didn't have none.\r\n\r\n\"I'll never forgit de trip from Chester to Burleson. I wouldn't 'member\r\nso well I don't guess, 'cepin' I had a big ol' sheep dog name Trailer.\r\nHe followed right in back of de wagon dat I was in. Us had to cross a\r\nwide stream what I tuk to be a ribber. When we started 'crost, ol'\r\nTrailer never stop followin'. I was watchin' him clost so if he gived\r\nout I was goin' to try to git him. He didn't giv' out, he didn't even\r\nhab to swim. He jes' walked 'long an' lapped de water lack a dog will.\r\n\r\n\"John took me an' kep' me in de cabin wid him. De cabin didn' hab no\r\nfurniture in hit lack we has now 'days. De bed was a one-legged, hit was\r\nmade in de corner of de room, wid de leg settin' out in de middle of de\r\nflo'. A plank was runned 'twix' de logs of de cabin an' nailed to de\r\npost on de front of de bed. Across de foot an' udder plank was runned\r\ninto de logs an' nail' to de leg. Den some straw or cornshucks was piled\r\non for a mattress. Us used anythang what we could git for kivver. De\r\ntable had two legs, de legs set out to de front whilst de back part was\r\nnail' to de wall. Us didn't hab no stove. Thar was a great big fireplace\r\nwhar de cookin' was done. Us didn't hab to cook, though, lessen us got\r\nhungry after supper been served at de house.\r\n\r\n\"I warn't nothin' but a chile endurin' slavery, but I had to wuk de same\r\nas any man. I went to de fiel' and hosed cotton, pulled fodder and\r\npicked cotton wid de res' of de han's. I kep' up too, to keep from\r\ngittin' any lashes dat night when us got home. In de winter I went to de\r\nwoods wid de men folks to ho'p git wood or to git sap from de trees to\r\nmake turpentine an' tar. Iffen us didn't do dat we made charcoal to run\r\nde blacksmif shop wid.\r\n\r\n\"De white folks was hard on us. Dey would whup us 'bout de leas' li'l\r\nthang. Hit wouldn't a been so bad iffen us had a had comforts, but to\r\nlive lack us did was 'nouf to make anybody soon as be dead. De white\r\nfolks tol' us dat us born to work for 'em an' dat us was doin' fine at\r\ndat.\r\n\r\n\"De nex' time dat I saw my mammy I was a great big boy. Dere was a 'oman\r\non de place what ever'body called mammy, Selina White. One day mammy\r\ncalled me an' said, Mingo, your mammy is comin'.' I said, 'I thought dat\r\nyou was my mammy.' She said 'No I ain't your mammy, yer mammy is 'way\r\nway from here. I couldn't believe dat I had anudder mammy and I never\r\nthought 'bout hit any mo'. One day I was settin' down at de barn when a\r\nwagon come up de lane. I stood 'roun' lack a chile will. When de wagon\r\ngot to de house, my mammy got out an' broke and run to me an' th'owed\r\nher arms 'roun' my neck an' hug an' kiss me. I never even put my arms\r\n'roun' her or nothin' of de sort. I jes' stood dar lookin' at her. She\r\nsaid, 'Son ain't you glad to see your mammy?' I looked at her an' walked\r\noff. Mammy Selina call me an' tol' me dat I had hurt my mammy's\r\nfeelin's, and dat dis 'oman was my mammy. I went off an' studied and I\r\nbegins to 'member thangs. I went to Selina an' ast her how long it been\r\nsence I seen my mammy. She tol' me dat I had been 'way from her sence I\r\nwas jes' a li'l chile. I went to my mammy an' tol' her dat I was sorry I\r\ndone what I did an' dat I would lack fer her to fergit an' forgive me\r\nfor de way I act when I fust saw her. After I had talked wid my real\r\nmammy, she told me of how de family had been broke up an' dat she hadn't\r\nseed my pappy sence he was sold. My mammy never would of seen me no mo'\r\nif de Lawd hadn' a been in de plan. Tom White's daughter married one of\r\nMr. Crawford's sons. Dey lived in Virginia. Back den it was de custom\r\nfor women to come home whenever dey husbands died or quit 'em. Mr.\r\nCrawford's son died an' dat th'owed her to hab to come home. My mammy\r\nhad been her maid, so when she got ready to come home she brung my mammy\r\nwid her.\r\n\r\n\"Hit was hard back in dem days. Ever' mornin' fo' day break you had to\r\nbe up an' ready to git to de fiel'. Hit was de same ever' day in de year\r\n'cep' on Sunday, an' den we was gittin' up earlier dan the folks do now\r\non Monday. De drivers was hard too. Dey could say what ever dey wanted\r\nto an' you couldn't say nothin' for yourse'f. Somehow or yuther us had a\r\ninstinct dat we was goin' to be free. In de even't when de day's wuk was\r\ndone de slaves would be foun' lock' in dere cabins prayin' for de Lawd\r\nto free dem lack he did de chillun of Is'ael. Iffen dey didn' lock up,\r\nde Marsa or de driver would of heard 'em an' whupped 'em. De slaves had\r\na way of puttin' a wash pot in de do' of de cabin to keep de soun' in de\r\nhouse. I 'members once ol' Ned White was caught prayin'. De drivers took\r\nhim de nex' day an' carried him to de pegs, what was fo' stakes drove in\r\nde groun'. Ned was made to pull off ever'thang but his pants an' lay on\r\nhis stomach 'tween de pegs whilst somebody stropped his legs an' arms to\r\nde pegs. Den dey whupped him 'twell de blood run from him lack he was a\r\nhog. Dey made all of de han's come an' see it, an' dey said us'd git de\r\nsame thang if us was cotched. Dey don't 'low a man to whup a horse lack\r\ndey whupped us in dem days.\r\n\r\n\"After my mammy come whar I was I ho'ped her wid her work. Her tas' was\r\ntoo hard for any one person. She had to serve as maid to Mr. White's\r\ndaughter, cook for all of de han's, spin an' card four cuts of thread a\r\nday an' den wash. Dere was one hundred an' forty-four threads to de cut.\r\nIf she didn't git all of dis done she got fifty lashes dat night. Many a\r\nnight me an' her would spin an' card so she could git her task de nex'\r\nday. No matter whut she had to do de nex' day she would have to git dem\r\nfo' cuts of thread, even on wash day. Wash day was on Wednesday. My\r\nmammy would have to take de clo's 'bout three quarters of a mile to de\r\nbranch whar de washin' was to be done. She didn't have no wash board\r\nlack dey have now 'days. She had a paddle what she beat de clo's wid.\r\nEver'body knowed when wash day was 'case dey could hear de paddle for\r\n'bout three or four miles. \"Pow-pow-pow,\" dat's how it sound. She had to\r\niron de clo's de same day dat she washed an' den git dem four cuts of\r\nthread. Lots of times she failed to git 'em an' got de fifty lashes. One\r\nday when Tom White was whuppin' her she said, 'Lay it on Marsa White\r\n'case I'm goin' to tell de Yankees when dey come.' When mammy got\r\nthrough spinnin' de cloth she had to dye it. She used shumake berries,\r\nindigo, bark from some trees, and dar was some kind of rock (probably\r\niron ore) what she got red dye from. De clo's wouldn't fade neither.\r\n\r\n\"De white folks didn't learn us to do nothin' but wuk. Dey said dat us\r\nwarn't 'spose' to know how to read an' write. Dar was one feller name\r\nE.C. White what learned to read an' write endurin' slavery. He had to\r\ncarry de chillun's books to school fer 'em an' go back atter dem. His\r\nyoung marsa taught him to read an' write unbeknowance' to his father an'\r\nde res' of de slaves. Us didn' have nowhar to go 'cep' church an' we\r\ndidn' git no pleasure outten it 'case we warn't 'lowed to talk from de\r\ntime we lef' home 'twell us got back. If us went to church de drivers\r\nwent wid us. Us didn't have no church 'cep' de white folks church.\r\n\r\n\"After ol' Ned got sech a terrible beatin' fer prayin' for freedom he\r\nslipped off an' went to de North to jine de Union Army. After he got in\r\nde army he wrote to Marsa Tom. In his letter he had dose words:\r\n\r\n\"'I am layin' down, marsa, and gittin' up, marsa;' meaning dat he went\r\nto bed when he felt like it an' got up when he pleased to. He told Tom\r\nWhite dat iffen he wanted him he was in the army an' dat he could come\r\nafter him. After ol' Ned had got to de North, de yuther han's begin to\r\nwatch for a chance to slip off. Many a one was cotched an' brung back.\r\nDey knowed de penalty what dey would have to pay, an' dis cause some of\r\n'em to git desp'rite. Druther dan to take a beatin' dey would choose to\r\nfight hit out 'twell dey was able to git away or die befo' dey would\r\ntake de beatin'.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of times when de patterollers would git after de slaves dey would\r\nhave de worse' fight an' sometimes de patterollers would git killed.\r\nAfter de war I saw Ned, an' he tol' me de night he lef' the patterollers\r\nrunned him for fo' days. He say de way he did to keep dem frum ketchin'\r\nhim was he went by de woods. De patterollers come in de woods lookin'\r\nfor him, so he jes' got a tree on 'em an' den followed. Dey figured dat\r\nhe was headin' fer de free states, so dey headed dat way too, and Ned\r\njes' followed dem for as dey could go. Den he clumb a tree and hid\r\nwhilst dey turned 'roun' an' come back. Ned went on widout any trouble\r\nmuch. De patterollers use ter be bad. Dey would run de folks iffen dey\r\nwas caught out after eight o'clock in de night, iffen dey didn' have no\r\npass from de marsa.\r\n\r\n\"After de day's wuk was done there warn't anything for de slaves to do\r\nbut go to bed. Wednesday night they went to prayer meetin'. We had to be\r\nin de bed by nine o'clock. Ever' night de drivers come 'roun' ter make\r\nsho' dat we was in de bed. I heerd tell of folks goin' to bed an' den\r\ngittin' up an' goin' to yuther plantation. On Sat'day de han's wukked\r\n'twell noon. Dey had de res' of de time to wuk dey gardens. Ever' fambly\r\nhad a garden of dere own. On Sat'day nights the slaves could frolic for\r\na while. Dey would have parties sometimes an' whiskey and home-brew for\r\nde servants. On Sundays we didn't do anything but lay 'roun' an' sleep,\r\n'case we didn' lack to go to church. On Christmas we didn't have to do\r\nno wuk: no more'n feed de stock an' do de li'l wuk 'roun' de house. When\r\nwe got through wid dat we had de res' of de day to run 'roun' wharever\r\nwe wanted to go. 'Co'se we had to git permission from de marsa.\r\n\r\n\"De owners of slaves use to giv' cornshuckin' parties, an' invite slaves\r\nfrom yuther plantations. Dey would have plenty of whiskey an' other\r\nstuff to eat. De slaves would shuck corn an' eat an' drink. Dey use'to\r\ngiv' cotton pickin's de same way. All of dis went on at night. Dey had\r\njack-lights in de cotton patch for us to see by. De lights was made on a\r\nforked stick an' moved from place to place whilst we picked. De corn\r\nshuckin' was done at de barn, an' dey didn' have to have de lights so\r\ndey could move dem frum place to place.\r\n\r\n\"De only games dat I played when I was young was marbles an' ball. I use\r\nto sing a few songs dat I heard de older folks sing lak:\r\n\r\n    Cecess ladies thank they mighty grand,\r\n      Settin' at de table, coffee pot of rye,\r\n    O' ye Rebel union band, have these ladies understan'\r\n      We leave our country to meet you, Uncle Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Dese songs was 'bout de soldiers an' de war. There was one 'bout ol'\r\nGeneral Wise what went:\r\n\r\n    Ol' General Wise was a mighty man,\r\n      And not a wise man either,\r\n    It took forty yards of cloth to make a uniform,\r\n      To march in de happy land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n    Chorus:\r\n\r\n    Ha-ha, ha-ha, de south light is comin',\r\n      Charge boys, charge, dis battle we mus' have,\r\n    To march us in the happy land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n\"There was a song 'bout General Roddy too:\r\n\r\n    Run ol' Roddy through Tuscumbia, through Tuscumbia,\r\n      We go marchin' on.\r\n\r\n    Chorus:\r\n\r\n    Glory, glory hallelujah, glory, glory hallelujah,\r\n      Glory, glory hallelujah as we go marchin' on.\r\n\r\n    Ol' Roddy's coat was flyin', ol' Roddy's coat flyin' high,\r\n      Twell it almost touch de sky, we go marchin' on.\r\n\r\n\"I was a pretty big boy when de war broke out. I 'member seein' the\r\nYankees cross Big Bear creek bridge one day. All of de sojars crossed de\r\nbridge but one. He stayed on de yuther side 'twell all de res' had got\r\n'crost, den he got down offen his horse an' took a bottle of somp'in'\r\nan' strowed it all over de bridge. Den he lighted a match to it an'\r\nfollowed de res'. In a few minutes the Rebel sojars come to de bridge to\r\ncross but it was on fire an' dey had to swim 'crost to de yuther side. I\r\nwent home an' tol' my mammy dat de Rebels was chasin' de Union sojars,\r\nan' dat one of de Unions had poured some water on de bridge an' sot it\r\nafire. She laugh' an' say: 'Son, don't you know dat water don't make a\r\nfire? Dat musta been turpentine or oil?' I 'member one day Mr. Tom was\r\nhavin' a big barbecue for de Rebel soldiers in our yard. Come a big\r\nroarin' down de military road, an' three men in blue coats rode up to de\r\ngate an' come on in. Jes' as soon as de Rebels saw 'em de all run to de\r\nwoods. In 'bout five minutes de yard was full of blue coats. Dey et up\r\nall de grub what de Rebels had been eatin'. Tom White had to run 'way to\r\nkeep de Yankees from gittin' him. 'Fo de Yankees come, de white folks\r\ntook all dey clo's an' hung 'em in de cabins. Dey tol' de colored folks\r\nto tell de Yankees dat de clo's was dere'n. Dey tol' us to tell 'em how\r\ngood dey been to us an' dat we lacked to live wid 'em.\r\n\r\n\"All day dat we got news dat we was free, Mr. White called us niggers to\r\nthe house. He said: 'You are all free, jes' as free as I am. Now go an'\r\ngit yerse'f somewhar to stick your heads.' Jes' as soon as he say dat,\r\nmy mammy hollered out: 'Dat's 'nough for a yearlin'. She struck out\r\n'crost de fiel' to Mr. Lee Osborn's to git a place for me an' her to\r\nstay. He paid us seventy-five cents a day, fifty cents to her an' two\r\nbits for me. He gave us our dinner along wid de wages. After the crop\r\nwas gathered fer that year, me an' my mammy cut an' hauled wood for Mr.\r\nOsborn. Us lef' Mr. Osborn dat fall an' went to Mr. John Rawlins. Us\r\nmade a share crop wid him. Us'd pick two rows of cotton an' he'd pick\r\ntwo rows. Us'd pull two rows of corn an' he'd pull two rows. He\r\nfurnished us wid rations an' a place to stay. Us'd sell our cotton an'\r\nopen corn an' pay Mr. John Rawlins for feedin' us. Den we moved wid Mr.\r\nHugh Nelson an' made a share crop wid him. We kep' movin' an' makin'\r\nshare crops 'twell us saved up 'nough money to rent us a place an' make\r\na crop fer ourse'ves. Us did right well at dis until de Ku Klux got so\r\nbad, us had to move back wid Mr. Nelson for protection. De mens that\r\ntook us in was union men. Dey lived here in the south but dey tooken us\r\npart in de slave business. De Ku Klux threat to whup Mr. Nelson 'case he\r\ntook up fer de niggers. Heap uv nights we would hear of the Ku Klux\r\ncomin' an' leave home. Sometimes us was scared not to go an' scared to\r\ngo 'way from home.\r\n\r\n\"One day I borrowed a gun frum Ed Davis to go squ'el huntin'. When I\r\ntaken de gun back I didn't unload hit lack I allus been doin'. Dat night\r\nde Ku Klux called on Ed to whup him. When dey tol' him to open de do',\r\nhe heard one of 'em say, 'Shoot him time he gits de do' open. 'Well, he\r\nsays to 'em,' wait 'twell I kin light de lamp.' Den he got de gun what I\r\nhad lef' loaded, got down on his knees an' stuck hit th'ough a log an'\r\npull de trigger. He hit Newt Dobbs in de stomach an' kilt him. He\r\ncouldn't stay 'roun' Burleson any mo', so he come to Mr. Nelson an' got\r\n'nough money to git to Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The Ku Klux got bad sho'\r\n'nough den and went to killin' niggers an' white folks, too.\r\n\r\n\"I ma'ied Kizi Drumgoole. Reverend W.C.

More than 90 years ago he was born not many miles from\r\nthis same cabin over in Mississippi as a slave of Col. Rupert, who owned\r\nplantations in Alabama and Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\"I come over to Alabama after the surrender,\" Abe Whitess told his\r\ninterviewer after he had retired with dignity to put on shoes before he\r\npermitted his photograph to be taken. \"I went to a plantation in Butler\r\nCounty fust and then came on down here to Bay Minette.\r\n\r\n\"Slavery wasn't so bad. Col. Rupert was a good marster, but he lived way\r\nover in Mobile and us was at his Scooby (Scooba) plantation. That was in\r\nKemper County and his overseer there sho was handy with a whup. I was a\r\ncotton hand and spent most of my time totin' water for the other hands.\r\nWhen Mr. Lincoln 'mancipated us we was free and I didn't carry any more\r\nwater. It wasn't 'twell after the surrender I went to Butler County,\r\nwhere Colonel Rupert had him another plantation.\r\n\r\n\"I come down here to Bay Minette a long time ago. I us'ta be chairman of\r\nthe Republican party in Baldwin County here, but when the Republicans\r\ngot in they made the white gem'mun what took my job postmaster. Then the\r\nbank I had my money in went busted in another Republican time and I\r\nloses $658.05. I votes for Mr. Roosevelt now.\"\r\n\r\nAbe Whitess stopped to take a chew of his favorite tobacco and admitted\r\nthat he lived alone in his one-room cabin by preference. He doesn't want\r\nwomen \"botherin' 'round his place and ain't had no truckin' with 'em for\r\nyears.\" He cooks on the hearth just as his mammy did before him decades\r\nago in the slave quarters of Colonel Rupert's plantation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Abe Whitess, Bay Minette, Alabama_]\r\n\r\nDespite his years, he is well able to take care of himself. He carries\r\nhis nine decades lightly, and his kindly face is topped by a wealth of\r\nsnow white hair. Though he lost money in the bank failure that made him\r\na Democrat in politics, Abe owns 14 acres of land, part of which he\r\nfarms. He has cleared a portion of it for a baseball diamond which is\r\nrented to Negro teams, who play there frequently. The fee is always\r\ncollected before a ball is thrown.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago he donated a part of the acreage to be used for a\r\npublic road which opened up a portion of Douglasville, the suburb in\r\nwhich he lives, where a number of Negroes had developed a residential\r\nsection. His people named him then and since \"Mayor of Douglasville,\"\r\nwithout office or emolument, but Abe wears the title with a dignified\r\ncontent for his remaining years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCallie Williams\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Callie Williams*\r\n    --_Mary A.

She lives at\r\n504 Eslava Street, Mobile.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy and pappy was brought to Alabama by specalators who sold 'em\r\nto Mr. Hiram McLemore at Newport Landing, on de Alabama ribber,\" Callie\r\nsaid. \"Mammy's name was Vicey and she was born in Virginia, but my pappy\r\nwas born in Kentucky. His name was Harry. Mr. McLemore had about three\r\nhundred head of slaves, some of 'em on one plantation of about two\r\nthousand acres an' de res' on another place of about five hundred acres.\r\nHe sho' did have a pretty house. It was all white and ramblin-like and\r\nhad big trees aroun' it. Dere was a cool well and a big dairy right\r\nclose by it and den de cabins was all in a row in de back, some of 'em\r\nmade out of planks, but mos' of 'em was made wid logs. Dey was all named\r\nafter whoever lived in 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Callie needed little urging to tell of the old days, and she claims\r\nto vividly remember her master's family.\r\n\r\n\"His wife was named Axie Bethea and he had seven children,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"One of 'em I never will forget, Miss Julia, 'case she gimme de first\r\ncalico dress I ever had and I was proud as a peacock wid it. Miss Julia\r\nwas de oldest little girl and dey give me to her.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy say dat dey waked up in de mornin' when dey heard de sweep.\r\nDat was a piece of iron hangin' by a string and it made a loud noise\r\nwhen it was banged wid another piece of iron. Dey had to get up at four\r\no'clock and be at work by sunup. To do dis, dey mos' all de time cook\r\nbreakfast de night befo'.\r\n\r\n\"Pappy was a driver under de overseer, but mammy say dat she stay at de\r\nlittle nursery cabin and look after all de little babies. Dey had a\r\ncabin fixed up with homemade cradles and things where dey put all de\r\nbabies. Der mammies would come in from de field about ten o'clock to\r\nnurse 'em and den later in de day, my mammy would feed de youngest on\r\npot-licker and de older ones on greens and pot-licker. Dey had skimmed\r\nmilk and mush, too, and all of 'em stayed as fat as a butter balls, me\r\namong 'em. Mammy saw dat I always got my share.\r\n\r\n\"De slaves got rations every Monday night. Dere would be three pounds of\r\nmeat and a peck of meal. Dere was a big garden dat all of 'em worked and\r\ndey had all de vegetables dey needed and dere was always plenty of\r\nskimmed milk. Dey cooked de meals on open fireplaces in de big iron\r\n'spiders.' Dem was big pots hangin' over the fire from a hook. Dey do de\r\ncookin' at night and den warm it over the nex' day if dey wanted it dat\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"While mammy was tendin' de babies she had to spin cotton and she was\r\nsupposed to spin two 'cuts' a day. Four 'cuts' was a hard day's work.\r\nWhat was a cut? You oughta' know dat! Dey had a reel and when it had\r\nspun three hundred yards it popped. Dat was a \"cut.\" When it had been\r\nspun, den another woman took it to de loom to make cloth for de slaves.\r\nDey always took Saturday afternoon to clean up de clothes and cabins,\r\n'case dey always had to start work on Monday mornin' clean as a pin. If\r\ndey didn't, dey got whupped for bein' dirty.\r\n\r\n\"Some of de niggers, after dey'd been beat, would try to run away and\r\nsome of 'em got loose, but de patterollers caught a lot of 'em and den\r\ndey'd get it harder dan ever befo' and have shackles out on dere feet\r\nwid jes' enough slack for 'em to walk so dey could work.\r\n\r\n\"If dey wanted to go 'possum huntin' or fishin', dey could get passes\r\nfrom de overseer. Two things dey really loved to eat was 'possum and\r\nfish. Dey'd eat and eat 'till dey'd get sick and den dey'd have to boil\r\nup a dose of Boneset tea to work 'em out. If dat didn't make 'em feel\r\nbetter, dey'd go to Marster. He always kept calomel, bluemas and quinine\r\non hand. If dey got too bad off sick, den marster would call de doctor.\r\nDe children wasn't bothered with nothin' much but worms and dey'd take\r\nJerusalem oak. It was de seed of a weed dat cook' and mix' 'lasses to\r\nmake it taste like candy. Boneset was a bush and dey'd boil de leaves to\r\nget boneset tea.\r\n\r\n\"Mos' of de time de slaves would be too tired to do anything but go to\r\nbed at night, but sometimes dey would set around and sing after supper\r\nand dey would sing and pray on Sunday. One of de songs dat was used mos'\r\nwas 'Yon Comes Old Marster Jesus.' If I remembers rightly, it went\r\nsomp'n' like dis:\r\n\r\n    I really believe Christ is comin' again\r\n    He's comin' in de mornin'\r\n    He's comin' in de mornin'\r\n    He's comin' wid a rainbow on his shoulder\r\n    He's comin' again bye and bye.\r\n\r\n\"Dey tried to make 'em stop singin' and prayin' durin' de war, 'case all\r\ndey'd ask for was to be sot free, but de slaves would get in de cabins\r\nand turn a big wash pot upside down and sing into dat, and de noise\r\ncouldn't get out. I don't remember nothin' about dis ceptin' what mammy\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\"When de Surrender come, she say dat a whole regiment of soldiers rode\r\nup to de house yellin' to de niggers dat dey was free. Den de soldiers\r\ntook de meat out of de smokehouse and got all de 'lasses and meal and\r\ngive it all to de niggers. Dey robbed de bees and den dey eat dinner and\r\ngo on to de nex' place, takin' de menfolks wid 'em, all 'ceptin' de ones\r\ntoo old, my pappy among 'em.\r\n\r\n\"After it was all over my pappy rented land on Mr. McLemore's place and\r\nhe and mammy stayed dere till dey died. Dey was buried in de same\r\ngraveyard dat Mr. McLemore had set aside for his slaves. I married Frank\r\nWilliams in Montgomery, Alabama, but our marriage was nothin' like mammy\r\nsay her and pappy's was. She say dey 'jumped de broom stick.' When any\r\nof de slaves wanted to get married dey would go to de big house and tell\r\nmarster and he'd get his broomstick and say, 'Harry, does you want\r\nVicey?' And Harry would say 'yes.' Den Marster would say, 'Vicey, does\r\nyou want Harry?', and she say 'yes.' Den marster say, 'Jine hands and\r\njump de broomstick and you is married. De ceremony wasn't much but dey\r\nstuck lots closer den, and you didn't hear about so many divorces and\r\nsuch as dat.\r\n\r\n\"All my children is dead but two. I had five. One is livin' in Atlantic\r\nCity, N.J., and I live here wid de other one. I 'spects I'll jes' go on\r\nlivin' here 'till I die, serving Ole Marster as bes' I can. If all de\r\npeoples on dis here earth would do dat, we wouldn't be pestered wid all\r\ndese here troubles like we is nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSilvia Witherspoon\r\n\r\n\r\n    *Interview with Silvia Witherspoon*\r\n    --_Susie R.

A large horsefly\r\nsettled upon her broad nose and after a moment Aunt Silvia's composure\r\nwas disturbed to such an extent that she waved it off with her hand. On\r\ndoing so her eyes opened and she saw me approaching the steps. She\r\nstraightened. \"Mawnin', Mistis. Jus' settin' heah coolin' off my foots.\r\nI'se plum wo' out f'um choppin' cotton.\r\n\r\n\"Yassmam,\" she continued, after I had asked a few questions, \"I\r\nremembers some things 'bout de slavery days. 'Co'se I can't remember\r\njus' 'zactly how old I is, but I mus' be mought nigh on to ninety,\r\n'ca'se I was a raght sizable gal when de war ended. I was bawn on a\r\nplantation in Jackson, Mississippi, dat belonged to my Massa, Dr. Minto\r\nWitherspoon. My Pappy an' Mammy was name Lum an' Phyllis Witherspoon. De\r\nwhite folks lived in a big, white house made outten logs. Honey, Massa\r\nan' Mistis Witherspoon was quality! Yassmam, dey was quality. Us slaves\r\nwas treated lak we was somp'n round dat place. Massa didn't 'low no\r\noberseer to tote no strop 'hine his niggers. Besides dat we was fed good\r\nan' had good clothes. He useta done had brogans sont out in boxfuls f'um\r\nMobile. My job was to do little things aroun' de white folks' house, but\r\nbefo' dat I stayed in de quarters an' nussed my mammy's chilluns, while\r\nshe worked in de fiel's. She would tie de smalles' baby on my back so's\r\nI could play widout no inconvenience. I laked to stay at de big house,\r\ndough, an' fan de flies offen de white folks while dey et. Dat was de\r\nbes' job I eber had. Mistis gived me a dress dat de white chilluns done\r\nout-growed an' on Sunday I was de dressed-upest nigger in de quarter.\r\n\r\n\"Massa 'longed to de Presbyterian chu'ch, so all us niggers was\r\nPresbyterians too. We all went to our own chu'ch dat was on de place\r\ndar.\r\n\r\n\"Massa kep' a pack of blood hounds but it warn't often dat he had to use\r\n'em 'ca'se none of our niggers eber runned away. One day, dough, a\r\nnigger named Joe did run away. Believe me Mistis, dem blood hounds cotch\r\ndat nigger 'fo' he got to de creek good. It makes me laugh till yit de\r\nway dat nigger jumped in de creek when he couldn't swim a lick jus'\r\n'ca'se dem houn's was atter him. He sho made a splash, but dey managed\r\nto git him out 'fo he drowned.\r\n\r\n\"I ma'ied about a year atter de war, an' Mistis, I didn't have no pretty\r\ndress to git ma'ied in. I ma'ied dat ole nigger in a dirty work dress\r\nan' my feets was bare jus' lak dey is now. I figured dat iffen he loved\r\nme, he loved me jus' as well in my bare feets as he would wid my shoes\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"Does I believe in ghosties? Sho I does. I don't suppose you was bawn\r\nwid a veil on yo' face lak I was, 'ca'se I can see dem ghosties as plain\r\nas dey was here raght now. I'll tell you 'bout one dat comes out de\r\nwhite folks chu'ch yard. On dark rainy nights, I sees him, tall wid long\r\nwhite robes drappin f'um him. He carries a big light so bright dat you\r\ncan't see his face, but he looks jus' lak a man. It don't bother me\r\nnone, 'ca'se I don't bother it.\r\n\r\n\"I keeps a flour sifter an' a fork by my bed to keep de witches f'um\r\nridin' me. How come I knows dey rides me? Honey, I bees so tired in de\r\nmawnin' I kin scarcely git outten my bed, an' its all on account of dem\r\nwitches ridin' me, so I putt de sifter dere to cotch 'em. Sometimes I\r\nwears dis dime wid de hole in it aroun' my ankle to keep off de conjure,\r\nbut since Monroe King tuk an' died us ain't had much conjerin' 'roun'\r\nhere. You know dat ole nigger would putt a conjure on somebody for jus'\r\na little sum of money. He sold conjure bags to keep de sickness away. He\r\ncould conjure de grass an' de birds, an' anything he wanted to. De\r\nniggers 'roun' useta give him chickens an' things so's he wouldn't\r\nconjure 'em, but its a funny thing Mistis, I ain't never understood it,\r\nhe got tuk off to jail for stealin' a mule, an' us niggers waited 'roun'\r\nmany a day for him to conjure hisself out, but he never did.

George knew the rigors of slavery under an absentee landlord and\r\nbrutal overseers, according to the story he tells.\r\n\r\n\"I was born on what was knowed as de Chapman Place, five miles nor'wes'\r\nof Livingston, on August 10th, 1846,\" George began his tale. My name was\r\nGeorge Chapman an' I had five brothers, Anderson, Harrison, William,\r\nHenry an' Sam, an' three Sisters, Phoebe, Frances and Amelia. My\r\nmother's name was Mary Ann Chapman an' my father's name was Sam Young,\r\nbut he b'longed to Mr. Chapman. Us all belonged to Governor Reuben\r\nChapman of Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"The overseer's name was Mr. John Smith, an' anudder's name was Mr.\r\nLawler. He was dere de year I was born, an' dey called hit \"Lawler\r\nyear.\" Bofe of 'em was mean, but Lawler, I hear tell, was de meanes'.\r\nDey had over three hund'ed slaves, caze dey had three plantations, one\r\nat Bodke, one in Huntsville and dis yere one. I can't say Marsa Chapman\r\nwasn't good to us, caze he was all de time in Huntsville an' jes' come\r\nnow an' den an' bring his family to see 'bouten' things. But de\r\noverseers was sho' mean.\r\n\r\n\"I seed slaves plenty times wid iron ban's 'roun' dey ankles an' a hole\r\nin de ban' an' a iron rod fasten to hit what went up de outside of dey\r\nleg to de wais' an' fasten to another iron ban' 'roun' de waist. Dis\r\nyere was to keep 'em from bendin' dey legs an' runnin' away. Dey call\r\nhit puttin' de stiff knee on you, an' hit sho' made 'em stiff! Sometimes\r\nhit made 'em sick, too, caze dey had dem iron ban's so tight roun' de\r\nankles, dat when dey tuck 'em off live things was under 'em, an' dat's\r\nwhut give 'em fever, dey say. Us had to go out in de woods an' git\r\nMay-apple root an' mullen weed an' all sich to bile for to cyore de\r\nfever. Miss, whar was de Lord in dem days? Whut was He doin'?\r\n\r\n\"But some of 'em runned away, anyhow. My brother Harrison was one, an'\r\ndey sot de \"nigger dogs\" on him lack fox houn's run a fox today. Dey\r\ndidn't run him down till 'bout night but finely dey cotched him, an' de\r\nhunters feched him to de do' an' say: \"Mary Ann, here' Harrison.\" Den\r\ndey turned de dogs loose on him ag'in, an' sich a screamin' you never\r\nhyared. He was all bloody an' Mammy was a-hollerin', 'Save him, Lord,\r\nsave my chile, an' don' let dem dogs eat him up.' Mr. Lawler said, 'De\r\nLord ain't got nothin' do wid dis here, an' hit sho' look lack He\r\ndidn't, 'caze dem dogs nigh 'bout chewed Harrison up. Dem was hard\r\ntimes, sho'.\r\n\r\n\"Dey didn't l'arn us nothin' an' didn't 'low us to l'arn nothin'. Iffen\r\ndey ketch us l'arnin' to read an' write, dey cut us han' off. Dey didn't\r\n'low us to go to church, neither. Sometimes us slip off an' have a\r\nlittle prayer meetin' by usse'ves in a ole house wid a dirt flo'. Dey'd\r\ngit happy an' shout an' couldn't nobody hyar 'em, 'caze dey didn't make\r\nno fuss on de dirt flo', an' one stan' in de do' an' watch. Some folks\r\nput dey head in de wash pot to pray, an' pray easy, an' somebody be\r\nwatchin' for de overseer. Us git whupped fer ev'ything iffen hit was\r\npublic knowed.\r\n\r\n\"Us wasn't 'lowed visit nobody from place to place, an' I seed Jim\r\nDawson, dis here same Iverson Dawson' daddy; I seed him stobbed out wid\r\nfo' stobs. Dey laid him down on his belly an' stretch his han's out on\r\nbofe sides an' tie one to one stob, an' one to de yuther. Bofe his feet\r\nwas stretch out an' tied to dem stobs. Den dey whupped him wid a whole\r\nboard whut you kiver a house wid. De darkies had to go dere in de night\r\nan' take him up in a sheet an' carry him home, but he didn't die. He was\r\n'cused of gwine over to de neighbor's plantation at night. Nine o'clock\r\nwas de las' hour us had to be closed in. Head man come out an' holler,\r\n\"Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Ev'ybody in an' do's locked.\" An' iffen you wan't,\r\nyou got whupped.\r\n\r\n\"Wan't nobody 'lowed to co't.

I may of went to dey house\r\nan' dey claim to pertec' me playin' wid dey little nigger chillun, but\r\niffen de Patterollers ketch me, dey claim dey wan't 'sponsible. One day,\r\ndey tuck out atter me an' I come right here in Livingston, but I was\r\ngwiner run away anyhow, 'caze I had seed ole Uncle Thornton dat mornin'.\r\nSee, I was de ca'f nusser an' soon as I lef' de house I met him, an'\r\nhere come de overseer, Mr. Smith. He sent atter me an' he said, 'I seed\r\nsix niggers in de woods whut run away,' an' asked did I see ole man\r\nThornton. I said, 'No, I ain't seed nobody.' He said, 'Nev' mine, I make\r\nyou tell a better tale'n dat in de mawnin'.' So when I went wid de slop\r\nto dem ca'ves I got to thinkin' 'bout dat whupping so I come right here.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Norville had a wood-shop right 'crost de road dere by de white\r\nfolks Baptis' church an' I hid in de back of hit dat night. But dey\r\nfoun' me an' tuck me back. Den dey stop me from ca'f nussin' an' put me\r\nin de fiel' under de head man. I was glad of dat, 'caze I wanted to be\r\nwid de other han's, but when I foun' out how 'twas, I wanted to be back.\r\nHit was a harder tas' den when I was nussin' ca'ves an' keepin' 'em from\r\nbreakin' in de fiel' an' eatin' up de crop.\r\n\r\n\"I was a good han' an' obeyed de owners an' de head man an' never had no\r\n'fuse 'bout work. I went one time to Bennet's Station, ten miles b'low\r\nhere, wid jes' seven mo' niggers from de Chapman place, an' us driv'\r\nover a thousan' head of cattle to Atlanta, Ga., an' never had no\r\ntrouble. I was easy pleased. Give me a piece of candy an' I'd lick hit\r\n'twel my mouf was so'. I reckon hit was all right, but I dunno. All de\r\nnations couldn't rule. Jes' lack hit is now, de stronges' people mus'\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _George Young, Livingston, Alabama_]\r\n\r\n\"Atter S'render, dey tuck a darky for de probit jedge, but dat nigger\r\ndidn't know nothin' an' he couldn't rule. So den dey tuck a white man\r\nname Sanders, an' he done all right. We was under hard task-masters an'\r\nI'm glad dey sot me free, 'caze I was under burden an' boun'. But\r\nignerrancy can't rule, hit sho' can't. We is darkies, an' white folks\r\nought to be favorable. Some speaks better words'n others, but ev'ybody\r\nain't got de same heart, an' dat's all I knows.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I dunno nuthin' 'bout no spirits, either, but Christ 'peered to\r\nde 'postles, didn't He, atter he been dead? An' I'se seed folks done\r\nbeen dead jes' as na'chel in de day as you is now. One day me an' my\r\nwife was pickin' cotton right out yonder on Mr. White's place, an' I\r\nlooked up an' seed a man all dressed in black, wid a white shirt bosom,\r\nhis hat a-sittin' on one side, ridin' a black hoss.\r\n\r\n\"I stoop down to pick some cotton, den look up an' he was gone. I said\r\nto my wife--I call her Glover but she go by two names--I said, Glover,\r\nwonder whar dat man went what was ridin' long yonder on dat pacin'\r\nhoss?' She say, 'What pacin' hoss an' what man?' I said, 'He was comin'\r\ndown dat bank by dat ditch. Dey ain't no bridge dere, an' no hoss could\r\njump hit.' Glover said, 'Well, I'm gwine in de house 'caze I don' feel\r\nlack pickin' cotton today.'\r\n\r\n\"But I ain't skeered of 'em. I gets out de path plenty times to let 'em\r\nby, an' iffen you kin see'em, walk 'roun' 'em. Iffen you can't see 'em,\r\nden dey'll walk 'roun' you. Iffen dey gets too plentiful, I jes' hangs a\r\nhoss shoe upside down over de do', an' don' have no mo' trouble. But\r\nev'ybody oughter have dat kinder min', to honor God. He 'peered to de\r\n'ciples atter He died, an' he said also, 'Peter, I'll give you de keys\r\nto de kingdom'. But Peter didn't have nobody's keys 'cep'in' his'n.\r\nDon't you know iffen he'd of give Peter all dem keys, dey's a heap of\r\nfolks Peter gwineter keep out of dere jes' for spite? God ain't gwineter\r\ndo nothin' dat foolish. Peter didn't have nobody's key 'cepin' Peter's!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal spelling has been maintained; e.g. \"_stob_--a short straight\r\npiece of wood, such as a stake\" (American Heritage Dictionary).--The\r\nWorks Progress Administration was renamed during 1939 as the Work\r\nProjects Administration (WPA).",
