The rest of the volume is occupied\r\nby an ethnological appendix, which presents the observations of early\r\nmissionary writers--Jesuit, Augustinian, and Franciscan--on the native\r\npeoples and their customs and beliefs. Due allowance being made for\r\ntheir ecclesiastical standpoint, these writers may be considered\r\nexcellent authority on this subject--especially Combés, who was one\r\nof the Jesuit pioneers in Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThe document first mentioned above is a letter from a Manila Jesuit,\r\nrelating events in that city during the year 1690-91. As in the\r\nlifetime of Pardo, there are dissensions between the ecclesiastical\r\nand the secular powers, the former represented by Bishop Barrientos,\r\nacting ruler of the archdiocese; the latter by the Audiencia until\r\nJuly, 1690, and after that by the new governor, Zabálburu. The bishop\r\nattempts to remove by force some of his prebends from the Augustinian\r\nconvent, but is foiled by the vigilance of the friars. Being opposed\r\nin this scheme by the auditors, Barrientos excommunicates them,\r\na proceeding which they ignore. At the coming of the new governor,\r\nhis favor is adroitly obtained by a military officer named Tomás\r\nde Endaya; and the auditors are for a time treated insolently by\r\nboth. Zabálburu soon shows, however, that no one can govern him;\r\nand he displays much egotism, contemns the religious, and oppresses\r\nthe Indians with exactions for public works.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Colin, one of the pioneers in the Philippine missions,\r\nfurnishes in his Labor evangélica (Madrid, 1663) a valuable account\r\nof the native races and their customs. He makes some attempt to\r\ntrace the origin of the Malayan tribes, which he places, for most,\r\nin the islands of Sumatra and Macasar (or Celebes), and for some in\r\nthe Moluccas. The Negritos came, he thinks, from Farther India, and\r\npossibly from New Guinea also. A chapter is devoted to the alphabet,\r\nmode of writing, and languages in use among the Filipínos. Colin\r\npraises their quickness and cleverness; some of them act as clerks\r\nin the public offices at Manila, and of these some are capable of\r\ntaking charge of such offices; and they are competent printers. Colin\r\ndiscourses at length upon the native languages--admiring the richness\r\nand elegance of the Tagálog--and upon their mode of bestowing personal\r\nnames. He then proceeds to describe their physical appearance, dress,\r\nornaments, treatment of hair and teeth, and tattooing; their food,\r\ncustoms in eating, and modes of making wine; their songs and dances;\r\ntheir habits of bathing. Their deities, religious observances,\r\nand superstitions are recounted--including the worship of spirits,\r\nancestors, idols, and phenomena of nature--and their ideas of the\r\ncreation, and of the origin of man. Their mortuary customs include\r\nthe employment of hired mourners, the embalming of the corpse, the\r\nkilling of slaves to accompany the soul of the deceased, and a taboo\r\nimposing silence. Colin gives an account of their limited form of\r\ngovernment (its unit the barangay); their laws, criminal and civil,\r\nwith their penalties (among which appears the ordeal); the different\r\nranks of society, and the occupations of the people; their weapons and\r\narmor; their marriages and divorces, and punishments for adultery. He\r\nalso recounts their customs in adoption of children, inheritance of\r\nproperty, and slavery. Similar information is furnished by another\r\nJesuit writer of note, Francisco Combés, on the native peoples of\r\nMindanao and other southern islands, in which he spent twelve years as\r\na missionary. He enumerates the several tribes and their distinctive\r\ncharacteristics; of these the Lutaos (or Orang-Laút, \"men of the sea\"),\r\nthe chief seafaring and trading tribe, have acquired an ascendancy\r\nover the others which is comparable to that of the Iroquois among\r\nthe North American Indians. Combés describes their mode of warfare,\r\nand ascribes to their aid the supremacy of Corralat over the other\r\nMoro chieftains, since their wars are of little importance except\r\nwhen waged by the sea-routes. These Lutaos of the coast hold in a\r\nsort of vassalage the Subanos, or river-dwellers, who are slothful,\r\nignorant savages, treacherous and cowardly. Combés next praises \"the\r\nnoble and brave nation of the Dapitans,\" a small tribe who migrated\r\nfrom Bohol to Mindanao; he relates their history as a people, and why\r\nthey changed their abode, and how they have always been the loyal\r\nfriends and followers of the Spaniards. The virtue and ability of\r\ntheir women receives much praise. Combés discusses the origin of the\r\nMindanao peoples, and sketches the general characteristics of each,\r\nand their mutual relations. According to our author, the Joloans and\r\nBasilans came from Butuan, in northeastern Mindanao; and the history\r\nof this migration is related in some detail, as well as the way in\r\nwhich the Joloans became so addicted to piracy.\r\n\r\nCombés proceeds to recount the beliefs and superstitions current in\r\nthe southern islands. Paganism prevails in them; but the southern\r\ncoast of Mindanao, and Basilan and Joló, are Mahometan. Curious\r\nlegends are related of the founder of the latter religion there, who\r\nis reverenced almost as a divinity; but those people know little\r\nof Mahomet's religion save its externals, and are practically\r\n\"barbarous atheists.\" The people are largely governed by omens;\r\nthey sometimes offer sacrifices to their old-time idols, but these\r\nhave little real hold on them. Sorcery has great vogue among them,\r\nand Corralat and other powerful chiefs excel in it; this is one\r\nsource of their ascendancy. Combés describes their mode of life:\r\ntheir food (which is little besides boiled rice), their clothing,\r\ntheir houses and furniture; and their usages and laws regarding\r\nconduct, crimes, and penalties. He regrets the prevalence of slavery,\r\nwhich profanes all social relations, and even destroys all kindness\r\nand charity. There is no class of freemen; all are either chiefs or\r\nslaves. All offenses are atoned for by the payment of money, save\r\ncertain unnatural crimes, which they punish with death. Among the\r\nMoros is practiced the ordeal by fire, and the burial of the living\r\nfor certain crimes; but some escape from these in safety, through\r\ntheir power as sorcerers. The authority and government of the chiefs is\r\ndescribed; they are tyrannical and rapacious, and treat as slaves even\r\nchiefs who are subject to them. Combés makes special mention of some\r\ncustoms peculiar to the Subanos, or river-people. They are exceedingly\r\nrude and barbarous, without any government; and a perpetual petty\r\nwarfare is waged among them. Their women, however, are more chaste\r\nthan those of other tribes, and Lutao girls of rank are reared, for\r\ntheir own safety, among the Subanos. Among these people is a class\r\nof men who dress and act like women, and practice strict celibacy;\r\none of them is baptized by Combés. A chapter is devoted to their\r\nburials and marriages. In the burial of the dead they spend lavishly,\r\nclothing the corpse in rich and costly garments; but they have ceased,\r\nunder Christian influence, to bury the dead man's treasures with\r\nhim. Marriages are celebrated with the utmost display, hospitality,\r\nand feasting; and with entire propriety and decorum. Another chapter\r\ndescribes the boats and weapons used by the natives.\r\n\r\nNext we present the famous letter on this subject by Gaspar de San\r\nAgustín (June 8, 1720); our text is collated with other versions, and\r\nfreely annotated from these, and from comments made by Delgado and Mas\r\non San Agustín's statements. San Agustín, who had spent forty years\r\namong the Filipinos, begins by expatiating on the great difficulty\r\nof comprehending the native character, which is inscrutable--\"not\r\nin the individuals, but in the race.\" They are fickle and false,\r\nalso of a cold temperament, and malicious, dull, and lazy--due to\r\n\"the influence of the moon.\" They are ungrateful, lazy, rude and\r\nimpertinent, arrogant, and generally disagreeable. San Agustín\r\nrelates many of their peculiar traits, and incidents showing these,\r\nto much disparagement of the natives. He berates their ignorance\r\nand superstition, their faults of character, their conduct toward\r\nthe Spaniards, their lack of religious devotion, etc.--exempting,\r\nhowever, from these censures in the main the Pampangos, who are more\r\nnoble, brave, and honorable, and are \"the Castilians of these same\r\nIndians;\" and the women, who are devout, modest, and moral (although\r\nhe ascribes this to the subjection in which they are held by the men,\r\nand the necessity for the women to support not only their children but\r\ntheir husbands). After all these complaints, San Agustín returns to\r\nhis former position, that it is impossible to understand the nature\r\nof the Filipinos; and all that he has related is but approximate and\r\ntentative. For this reason, it is necessary (especially for religious)\r\nto know how to conduct oneself with them. He therefore makes various\r\nsuggestions for enabling their spiritual fathers to guide them\r\ndiscreetly and successfully. No less interesting than his account\r\nof the people are the comments made thereon by the Jesuit Delgado\r\n(himself long a missionary in the islands), and the Spanish official\r\nMas, who spent some time there and visited many of the islands. The\r\nformer refutes many of San Agustín's statements, sometimes very\r\nsharply; the latter often supports them, but sometimes he finds\r\nthem in contradiction to what he himself has observed. Fray Gaspar's\r\nletter impresses the reader, at first, as being the complaint of an\r\nirritable and querulous old man (he wrote it at the age of seventy);\r\nbut another cause for his mental attitude may be found toward the end\r\nof his letter, where he argues against the proposed ordination of\r\nFilipino natives as priests--a plan which aroused great opposition\r\nfrom the religious orders. The MS. which we use contains a sort of\r\nappendix to San Agustín's letter in the shape of citations from the\r\nnoted Jesuit writer Murillo Velarde. These are evidently adduced in\r\nsupport of San Agustin's position, and disparage the character of the\r\nIndians in vigorous terms. Finally, we present a chapter from Delgado's\r\nHistoria de Filipinas making further comment on San Agustín's letter,\r\nand defending the natives from the latter's aspersions; he refutes many\r\nof these, and censures Fray Gaspar severely. He also regards Murillo\r\nVelarde's description of the native character as hasty, superficial,\r\nand exaggerated. Besides, Delgado reminds his readers of the great\r\nservices rendered to the Spaniards by the Indians--who alone carry\r\non the agriculture, stock-raising, trade, and navigation on which\r\nthe support of the Spaniards (who, \"when they arrive at Manila, are\r\nall gentlemen\") absolutely depends--and declares that the Spaniards\r\nthemselves are arrogant and tyrannical toward the Indians.\r\n\r\nAdditional information regarding the native peoples is afforded by\r\nthe Franciscan writer Juan Francisco de San Antonio, in his Crónicas\r\n(Manila, 1738-44). He begins with a dissertation on the origin of the\r\nFilipino Indians, in examining which he finds many difficulties. He\r\nnotes several of the mixtures of different races which have produced\r\ndistinct types; among these he is inclined to class the half-civilized\r\nmountain-dwellers in the larger islands--who, as he thinks, spring\r\nfrom either civilized Indians who have retreated to the hill-country,\r\nor from the intercourse of native Filipinos with Japanese, Chinese,\r\nand other foreigners. The Chinese and Japanese who live in and\r\nnear Manila, and some Malabar mestizos, are desirable elements of\r\nthe population. The Negritos are the aboriginal inhabitants; in\r\nformer times they harassed the Indian natives with frequent raids,\r\nand killed all who ventured into the mountain region. In the time of\r\nSan Antonio, the Indians secretly pay them tribute, in order to avoid\r\ntheir raids. He describes their physical aspect, costume, and mode of\r\nlife; he conjectures that they came to the Philippines originally from\r\nNew Guinea. The civilized peoples may all be reduced to the Tagálogs,\r\nPampangos, Visayans, and Mindanaos; all are of Malay stock. Of these,\r\nthe first probably came from Malacca, as traders, remaining in Luzón\r\nas conquerors; the Pampangos, from Sumatra. The Visayans may have\r\ncome from the Solomon Islands, but this is not certain. In Mindanao,\r\nas in Luzón, the black aborigines were driven into the interior\r\nby the Malay traders who came there. These latter show much tribal\r\nvariation, but all must have come from the near-by islands of Borneo,\r\nMacasar, or the Moluccas. San Antonio characterizes these Mindanao\r\npeoples separately. The coast tribes are partly Mahometan, partly\r\nchristianized; the missions among them are those of the Recollects\r\nand Jesuits. The mountain tribes are apparently the aboriginal\r\nnatives--also Malayan, according to some, but it may be from Celebes\r\nor other islands. All these our author presents as conjectures only;\r\n\"God is the only one who knows the truth.\" He proceeds to describe the\r\ncharacteristics and disposition of the Filipino natives, which is full\r\nof contradictions. They are hospitable, but neglect their parents;\r\nand are deceitful and ungrateful. They are exceedingly clever and\r\nimitative, and even show much ability in many occupations and mental\r\nexercises; but they are apt to be superficial, incorrect, indifferent\r\nto results, slothful and lacking in concentration of mind. \"Their\r\nunderstandings are fastened with pins, and attached always to material\r\nthings.\" Our writer then describes the languages, mode of writing,\r\nmanners and names, that are current among these peoples; also their\r\nphysical features, clothing, and adornments. Curiously enough,\r\nSan Antonio states that the Visayans have--(in his day) given up\r\nthe practice of tattooing their bodies. He proceeds to recount the\r\nreligious beliefs and superstitions of the Filipinos, much as Colin\r\nand other early writers have done, but with somewhat more detail in\r\ncertain matters, especially in regard to the omens and superstitions\r\nof the people. Their government and social conditions (especially the\r\nformer practice of enslavement) are described in detail; also their\r\ncustoms in regard to marriages and dowries, transaction of business,\r\nweights and measures, inheritances, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Editors\r\n    June, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT OF 1691\r\n\r\n\r\n   Events at Manila. [Unsigned; June, 1691.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: This document is obtained from the Ventura del Arco MSS. (Ayer\r\nlibrary), iv, pp. 53-67.\r\n\r\nTranslation: This is made by Emma Helen Blair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTS AT MANILA, 1690-91\r\n\r\n\r\n    Relation of what occurred in Manila from June 24, 1690 to\r\n    the present month of June in this year, 1691.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tragedy which for years has been enacted in this city of Manila has\r\nhad some variation this year, from the time when the galleon \"Santo\r\nCristo de Burgos\" set sail for Nueva España up to the present month\r\nof July, in which the galleon called \"Nuestra Señora del Rosario,\r\nSan Francisco Javier y Santa Rosa\" has been fitted up for the said\r\nnavigation. By it is [sent] this written relation, which will contain\r\nthe most notable events which have occurred in Manila, omitting many\r\nothers, on account of not having secured information of them because\r\nthey occurred outside of Manila.\r\n\r\nI have already written, last year, of the condition in which the\r\naffairs of the bishop of Troya remained; to wit, that the necessary\r\ndecrees were issued by the royal Audiencia that the bishop should\r\nrestore the [ecclesiastical] government to the cabildo, to whom it\r\nbelonged, as appears from the acts which the cabildo had presented\r\nin the Audiencia--not only by way of appeal from fuerza, but also on\r\nbehalf of the right of the royal patronage, which resided in that body,\r\nsince the said Audiencia was exercising the civil government in these\r\nislands. These efforts were hindered by the efforts of the auditor\r\nDon Alonso, former commander of the troops, and Don Tomas de Endaya,\r\nmaster-of-camp of the army in Manila for which I refer to the account\r\nwhich was given to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nThis, then, by way of preliminary. When the galleon \"Santo Cristo\r\nde Burgos\" set sail for Nueva España, there was little respite from\r\nnegotiations of this sort, as we had hoped would be the case until the\r\narrival of the new governor, [1] who thought that he would certainly\r\narrive that year. Thus ran the talk of all. But, as the said bishop\r\nis so peculiar in his decisions, he made an astonishing resolution;\r\nthis was, to go in person to the convent of San Agustin, a little\r\nafter two o'clock in the afternoon, having crossed a great part of\r\nthe city on foot, accompanied by two clerics (it is evident that they\r\nmust have been among the most unassuming ones), laden with pistols\r\nand other weapons, in order to take away from the said convent the\r\ndean, the cantor, and other prebends from the place where they had\r\ntaken refuge--their safety being, for fear of the bishop, protected\r\nby royal decrees.\r\n\r\nThis performance gave much material for gossip, in which the blame was\r\nlaid upon the commander of the troops and his favorite Don Tomas, and\r\neven on the Augustinian friars themselves, for having all left the city\r\nthat day in order that thus the bishop could carry out his purpose,\r\nwithout its being easy to secure recourse from the violence which he\r\nintended; for the commander of troops had gone to take supper at a\r\ncountry house, the provincial of St. Augustine had betaken himself\r\nto a resort on the river, and the prior had left the convent just at\r\ntwo o'clock.\r\n\r\nThis scheme, if it were one, was not carried out; for the choristers\r\nand the vicar of the convent, being informed how the bishop intended\r\nto remove thence the persons who were protected by his Majesty and\r\nentrusted to their care, made it a point of honor that such an accident\r\nshould [not] happen, since neither the provincial nor the prior was in\r\nthe convent; accordingly, by the time the bishop arrived they closed\r\nthe gates of the convent, not permitting him to enter. Thereupon\r\nvarious colloquies took place between the two parties, making the case\r\nmore plausible by the detention of the bishop and his satellites at\r\nthe gate opening into the street. Meanwhile the friars had time to\r\nnotify the prior and inform the gentlemen of the royal Audiencia.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of the prior, entrance into the convent was made easy\r\nfor his illustrious Lordship, to whom the friars set forth that they\r\ncould not gratify his wishes without first making the auditors aware\r\nof his claims. The bishop agreed to this, but on condition that they\r\nnotify only Don Alonzo, of whom his illustrious Lordship must have been\r\nsure. In short, the fact is that the case first reached the auditors'\r\nears; and they, assembled in session, issued the decrees which, as\r\nI mentioned above, they left to the efforts of Señor Fuertes--who\r\nin all haste went to the palace, and finding the auditors in the\r\ncouncil-chamber, displayed much anger that they should have made such\r\na decision without his presence and counsel.\r\n\r\nSince there is no remedy, when a thing has been done, except patience,\r\nas the common saying goes, it was now arranged that Señor Fuertes\r\nand Señor Ozaeta should go to San Agustín to pacify the bishop, in\r\nwhich task they spent the greater part of the afternoon. The unjust\r\nthings said by the bishop to Señor Ozaeta, and the uncivil language\r\nwhich he tolerated from the bishop, are not fit to relate. At five\r\no'clock in the afternoon, the bishop went away from San Agustin quite\r\nrebuffed but very respectfully treated by the two auditors and their\r\nnumerous companions. In front of his illustrious Lordship walked\r\nhis provisor and faithful Achates, Master Don Geronimo Caraballo,\r\nbitterly lamenting the miserable condition in which Manila was,\r\nsince they were hindering their prelate in a resolution so just,\r\nsince it was to punish those wicked clerics who had taken refuge in\r\nSan Agustin. It is well to note the pious exclamation of this prebend,\r\nfor it will be quite important to the case afterward.\r\n\r\nThis chimerical attempt turned out badly for his illustrious Lordship\r\nin the end; and he undertook to be revenged when one was least looking\r\nfor it. For the news having arrived, on July 30, that one of the\r\ntwo galleons which were expected on the return voyage from Nueva\r\nEspaña had reached the Embocadero, and that in it was coming the\r\ngovernor, there was discussion whether his illustrious Lordship was\r\nproceeding in the execution of his designs. But it was not thus; for\r\nhis illustrious Lordship, a few days after this information arrived,\r\nposted the auditors as excommunicated, saying that they had incurred\r\nthis by the bull De cena, forasmuch as they had tried cases which by\r\nright belonged to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, as the law states\r\nthat these are not separated from that jurisdiction. Notwithstanding\r\nthe publication of their names, the auditors ignored the censure, as\r\nlaunched a non judice [i.e. \"by one who is not a judge\"]; but it was\r\nnot on this account that not only they but the entire city yielded to\r\nthe pressure of great anxiety. For they feared lest the new governor,\r\nwhose coming was daily expected, would be tinctured with the same\r\nopinions as those held by Don Gabriel, the deceased governor--which\r\nwere based on the same sort of case as was then occurring. For, they\r\nsaid, since a new governor (who is the only arbiter for all classes\r\nin Manila) was at the gates of the city [he might] without searching\r\nhis own mind, have taken a resolution so unusual that even Don Felipe\r\nPardo had not ventured to execute it against the corporate body of\r\nan Audiencia. It is not possible that there should be any secret\r\ninformation. People confirmed it when they learned how Don Tomas de\r\nEndaya had sent a despatch to the ship by a person who stood high in\r\nhis regard, in a very swift champan, so that he could in the name\r\nof Don Tomas give his letters and welcome to the governor who was\r\nexpected, with a valuable present. It was well known that the said\r\nchampan had been wrecked; but it was also learned that the person who\r\nbore that commission had landed, before the wreck of the champan, in\r\none of the provinces there; but it was not known whether the present\r\n[that he carried] was landed, and for this reason it was uncertain\r\nwhether the determinations of the bishop were the results of the\r\nassiduity of Don Tomas de Endaya, who was a supporter of the bishop.\r\n\r\nThe talk went further; for inasmuch as the first news which reached\r\nthese islands that the ship had arrived at the Embocadero was sent\r\nto Don Tomas de Endaya by his brother Don Bernardo--whom, they said,\r\nhe had made alcalde of Catbalongan, which is the first passage and\r\nentrance into these islands--[they said that this was done], first,\r\nthat he might place in safety the thousands of pesos which he expected\r\nwould be brought to him by the patache which he had sent to Nueva\r\nEspaña, laden with goods belonging to himself and Don Gabriel de\r\nCuruzealegui, which was coming on its return voyage; and second,\r\nthat he might gain the good-will of the new governor with gifts\r\nand favors. The latter opinion prevailed, and on this ground people\r\nconsidered the action of the bishop of Troya as not so bold. These\r\nalone were the topics discussed, proceeding from the beginnings\r\nwhich they fancied to be facts. But after they experienced some of\r\nthe actions of the new governor, they regarded as certain that which\r\nbefore they had only considered probable. For, the royal Audiencia\r\nhaving decided that Auditor Don Juan de Sierra should go in their\r\nname to welcome the governor, the said auditor went up the river\r\nto fulfil his commission, and, having met the piragua in which the\r\ngovernor was coming with his family, the auditor went close to it,\r\nto present his message; but neither did the governor open the curtain\r\nof the pavilion or stern-cabin of the vessel, nor permit the auditor\r\nto speak to him, but obliged him to sheer off from the side of the\r\npiragua. At this rebuff, the said auditor was obliged to join the\r\nother vessels which accompanied the governor, following the piragua,\r\nwhich was very swift--for from the ranch of Don Tomas de Endaya\r\n(where the governor had been entertained as a guest) to Manila is\r\na journey of at least one day, but the piragua made it in much less\r\ntime. Thus the foresight of Don Tomas gained not only the privilege\r\nof entertaining the governor, but the opportunity of becoming his\r\nfavorite, for which purpose he acted thus.\r\n\r\nThe governor arrived at Manila about four o'clock in the afternoon;\r\nthe wind was blowing violently, and the rain fell in torrents,\r\nheavier than have been seen for many years in these islands. All\r\nthese discomforts were overcome by the bold and impetuous disposition\r\nof our new governor; but I am not surprised at such haste, since\r\nhe came for more than to obtain a bishopric. He was lodged in the\r\nbuildings which the city had made ready for him, where he was awaited\r\nby Don Tomas de Endaya, with other citizens of his following, and\r\nthey retired to his room, which had been prepared for him. He shut\r\nhimself up there with Don Tomas, and gave orders to the guard that\r\nno one should be allowed to enter. At the same time the auditor Don\r\nJuan de Sierra arrived to acquit himself of his embassy; he had been\r\nthoroughly wet on the river, but the captain of the guard detained\r\nhim, telling him of the order that he had, not to allow any one to\r\nenter. The auditor replied that these orders ought not to apply to an\r\nauditor who came in the name of the royal Audiencia. The captain of\r\nthe guard then carried word to the governor, telling him how Auditor\r\nDon Juan de Sierra was there, who had come on behalf of the royal\r\nAudiencia to welcome his Lordship. The governor answered that he\r\nhad come there fatigued, and that he was not ready for visits; and\r\nthen he continued to walk up and down, hand in hand with Don Tomas,\r\nand shut in his room, until the night had well begun. Then the said\r\n[Don Tomas] took his leave, returning to his house within Manila,\r\nwith much contentment, and explained to several confidants how he had\r\nfirmly established himself, and that they had formed a close alliance;\r\nbut that it would be more veiled than that which had existed between\r\nthe said Don Tomas and Don Gabriel--the new governor promising to\r\nfavor his affairs in every way. Such was the judgment formed at the\r\ntime, and that opinion is further strengthened every day.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, early in the forenoon, Don Alonso--who is\r\nthe person charged with the direction of military affairs--went to\r\nvisit the new governor, by whom he was very kindly and graciously\r\nreceived. They spent several hours in conversation, alone or in\r\ncompany with the said Don Tomas; and Don Alonso informed him of all\r\nthe troubles that he and his associates had experienced in regard\r\nto matters connected with the bishop of Troya; for this was the\r\nprincipal design which both sides had--the friendly reception of the\r\nnew governor. The Audiencia did not go to visit the governor until they\r\nascertained whether he would receive them, fearing, on account of the\r\nreasons which have been mentioned, that the excommunication which the\r\nbishop had made known to them had been imposed through the influence\r\nof the governor. But this turned out better than they expected,\r\nfor he received them with much friendliness; he took a seat below,\r\nwith them all, trying to treat all with kindness, and gratifying not\r\nonly Don Tomas and his faction but the Audiencia. Various events and\r\ncircumstances occurred at the time when he was making arrangements\r\nfor his entry into the city, which tended to persuade all that no\r\none would govern him, and that his proceedings would be those of an\r\nupright judge.\r\n\r\nHe made, then, his entry, and soon displayed the energy of his nature,\r\nand a hasty and vehement disposition. One day, when the soldiers in the\r\nguard-room of his palace were talking loudly at a gaming-table, he came\r\ndown in person, and with his blows broke a cane on the men; with this,\r\nhe gained among the soldiers the surname of \"the good sergeant.\" He\r\nissued numberless proclamations, which no one now observes, because\r\nthe man's disposition has been recognized. He was very solicitous about\r\nthe night patrols, not only within but without Manila--obliging those\r\nwithin the walls to go about at night with torches; and ordaining to\r\nthe people outside that after eight o'clock no one should go out of\r\nhis house, under penalty of two years in the galleys and two hundred\r\nlashes. A Dominican religious who did not know of these new orders,\r\ngoing to hear a confession in his ministry outside the walls of\r\nManila, encountered the patrol within his own village--at which he\r\nwas surprised, as it was not customary for the patrols to enter the\r\nvillages outside the walls, on account of the knavish acts which the\r\nsoldiers are wont to commit under pretext of making the rounds. For\r\nthis reason the said religious ordered them to depart from the said his\r\nministry, and to patrol in their accustomed beat; but, although they\r\ndid not obey him, they informed the governor next day of the opposition\r\nwhich the religious had made to the patrol. At this the new governor,\r\nbeing angry without good reason, gave orders that if any minister tried\r\nto forbid the patrol, they should notify him three times, and, if he\r\npersisted in his opposition, they should seize him by the collar and\r\ncarry him a prisoner to a fort, until they could report to him on the\r\nnext day. It is to be noted that these patrols, commanders as well as\r\nsoldiers, are usually native mulattoes, and mestizos from Nueva España.\r\n\r\nAt the fiesta of the naval battle, at which the governor was present,\r\nhe showed extreme resentment, and uttered sharp complaints because\r\nhe who recited the epistle turned his back on the governor's\r\nwife--doubtless thinking that he who recited the gospel had his\r\nface turned toward her not because the rubrics require that it be\r\nread while facing the people, but in order to show her the attention\r\nthat was due her; and therefore he criticised him who had recited the\r\nepistle. Not less absurd was his assuming that he ought to be named\r\nin the prayers at mass, after the king, as is done with the viceroy;\r\nand as this was not done at a fiesta at which he was present, he was\r\nso vexed that there also he chose to display his resentment. It was\r\nwith some difficulty that the auditors pacified him at the time, and\r\nafterward made him understand how unreasonable he was in the matter.\r\n\r\nHe prides himself on being very learned, and that he needs no advice\r\nfrom any one, holding it as an established maxim that the religious lie\r\nto him in whatever they say or propose in favor of the Indians. From\r\nthis results the extreme contempt in which the religious now find\r\nthemselves [held by him], and the grievous oppression which the poor\r\nIndians experience; for, from the very month in which this governor\r\nentered Manila, the Indians have not ceased their labors [on public\r\nworks] to this day, without any attention being paid to the times when\r\nthey ought to attend to their farming, or to the inclemency of the\r\nrainy seasons--not even in a sort of pestilence which has prevailed\r\nin this [province] of Tagalos among the Indians. Sick as they were,\r\n[the officials] obliged them with blows to go to their toil in\r\ntimber-working, where not a few fell dead from the labor and their\r\nillness; and all this, only to build one ship (a very small one), on\r\naccount of the unnecessary destruction of the galleon \"Santo Niño,\"\r\nwhich Don Juan de Bargas had constructed in his term as governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe documents contained in this volume are obtained from the following\r\nsources:\r\n\r\n1.

Those chapters here follow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    Of the origin of the nations and peoples who inhabit these\r\n    islands\r\n\r\n\r\n25. Although these are islands it will not be necessary to fatigue the\r\nmind by discussing (as do San Agustin and other authors in respect to\r\nother islands and to America) whence and how people and animals came\r\nto them. For if some of these islands have been, at any time since\r\nthe flood, part of a continent, from that time men and animals could\r\nremain in them; while if they have always been islands, the nearness of\r\nsome of them to others, and of some of them to the mainland of Asia,\r\nwhence began the propagation of the human race and the settlements\r\nof the descendants of Noah, is sufficient reason why some of them\r\ncould come to settle these regions. And that this was really so,\r\nand that the principal settler of these archipelagoes was Tharsis,\r\nson of Javan, together with his brothers, as were Ophir and Hevilath\r\nof India, we see in the tenth chapter of Genesis, which treats of\r\nthe dispersion of peoples and the settlement of countries, as we\r\nestablish in another place.\r\n\r\n26. Now then, coming to our theme, when the conquistadors and settlers\r\narrived at these islands and subdued that of Manila, they found\r\nthree varieties or kinds of people in them. Those who held command\r\nof it [i.e., the island of Manila], and inhabited the seashore and\r\nriver-banks and all the best parts round about, were Moro Malays\r\nof Borney (according to their own report). That is an island also,\r\nand is larger than any of these Filipinas and nearer the mainland of\r\nMalaca, where there is a district called Malayo. [2] This place is\r\nthe origin of all the Malays who are scattered throughout the most\r\nand best of all these archipelagoes. From that nation of the Malays\r\nsprings that of the Tagálogs, who are the natives of Manila and its\r\nneighborhood. That is proved by the Tagálog language, which resembles\r\nthe Malay closely; by the color and lines of the whole body; by the\r\nclothing and habit that they wore at the arrival of the Spaniards\r\nhere; and lastly by the customs and ceremonies, all of which were\r\nderived from the Malays and other nations of India. The occasion of\r\ntheir coming to these parts might have been either that they were\r\ndriven by chance through these seas (as we have seen in our days,\r\nborne to these islands people from other unknown islands, who spoke a\r\nlanguage that no one understood, and who had been driven by the sea);\r\nor they could have come hither purposely in the search for new lands on\r\nwhich to settle, because their own were too crowded, or some disaster\r\nhad overtaken them which caused them to leave their home forever. But\r\nit is very likely that greed and commercial interests attracted them,\r\nas occurred in the parts of India with regard to the Moros, Persians,\r\nand Arabs. The Portuguese say in their histories that when they reached\r\nthose kingdoms they found the Moros uppermost and masters of all,\r\nby reason of the commerce which they introduced among the heathen\r\nkings and rulers, the natives of the country, whose goodwill the\r\nMoros contrived to secure with rich and valuable presents. Little\r\nby little they continued to remain in the land and pay the royal\r\nduties, until they became so powerful that they revolted against\r\nthe real rulers and deprived them of the best of their lands. Barros\r\n[3] says that the first Portuguese found that that had happened in\r\nthose districts of India some hundred and fifty years before their\r\narrival. In the same way one may imagine the passage of the Malays\r\nto Borney to have occurred, and of the Borneans to Manila; and that\r\nalong with the arms and temporal commerce would come some caciques,\r\n[4] or priests of the cursed Mahometan religion, who introduced that\r\nreligion into the villages and maritime nations of these parts. As\r\nfor me I can readily believe that that great island of Borney in past\r\ncenturies was continued on the northeast by Paragua, and on the south\r\n[5] by the lands near Mindanao, as is indicated by the shoals and\r\nislets of Paragua on the one side, and those called Santa Juana and\r\nother islets and shoals which extend toward Jolo and Taguima, opposite\r\nthe point of La Caldera on the Mindanao shore. If this assumption be\r\ntrue, as is affirmed by aged Indians of those parts, the opportunity\r\nfor the Borneans to scatter through the Filipinas is very evident.\r\n\r\n27. It is probable that the inhabitants would come to Borney\r\nimmediately from Samatra, which is a very large land quite near the\r\nmainland of Malaca and Malayo. In the midst of that great island\r\nof Samatra there is a large and extensive lake [6] whose marge is\r\nsettled by many different nations, whence, according to tradition,\r\nthe people went to settle various islands. A Pampango of sense (one\r\nof these nations) finding himself adrift and astray there through\r\nvarious accidents (and from whom I learned it), testified that those\r\npeople [of Sumatra] spoke excellent Pampango, and wore the oldtime\r\ndress of the Pampangos. When he questioned one of their old men,\r\nthe latter answered: \"You [Pampangos] are descendants of the lost\r\npeople who left here in past times to settle in other lands, and were\r\nnever heard of again.\" It can also be believed that the Tagálogs,\r\nPampangos, and other civilized nations, analogous in language, color,\r\nclothing, and customs, came from parts of Borney and Samatra, some\r\nfrom certain provinces or neighborhoods and some from others. That\r\nis the reason for the difference of the languages, according to the\r\ncustom of these uncivilized lands, for every province or neighborhood\r\nhas a different language.\r\n\r\n28. The nations of the Bisayas and Pintados, who inhabit the\r\nprovinces of Camarines in this island of Luzon, and those of Leyte,\r\nSamar, Panay, and other neighborhoods, came, I have heard, from the\r\ndistricts of Macasar, where it is said that Indians live who make\r\ndesigns on and tattoo the body, in the manner of our Pintados. Pedro\r\nFernandez de Quiros, in the relation which he wrote of the discovery\r\nof the Salomon Islands in 1595, says that an island called Madalena\r\nwas found in ten degrees north latitude, at a distance from Pirù of\r\none thousand eight hundred leguas (which is nearly the same latitude\r\nand distance as the Filipinas) where Indians of good proportion,\r\nbut taller than the Spaniards, and all naked and bearing designs on\r\ntheir bodies, legs, arms, and hands (and some on their faces), in\r\nthe manner of our Visayans, were found. Consequently, it is apparent\r\nthat there are other nations of Pintados to be discovered. We have\r\nas yet not enough data, nor even a well founded conjecture, to say\r\nwhether ours originated from the latter, or on the contrary both\r\nfrom some mainland. We know well that people who tattoo the body\r\nhave been seen in Brasil and Florida. Then, too, this custom was\r\nformerly seen in some nations of Scythians in Asia and of Britons\r\nin Europa. But we cannot yet determine the legitimate origin of our\r\nVisayan Pintados. If some of the natives of Mindanao, Jolo, Bool,\r\nand part of Cebu, who are lighter-complexioned, braver, and of better\r\nproportions than the pure Visayans, are not Borneans, they might be\r\nTernatans--as may be inferred from the neighborhood of the lands and\r\nthe communication of one with another; and because in what concerns\r\nthe worship and religion of the cursed Prophet, even today they are\r\ngoverned by Terrenate; and when they find themselves beset by the\r\ntroops from Filipinas, they make an alliance and help one another.\r\n\r\n29. All those whom the first Spaniards found in these islands with the\r\ncommand and lordship over the land are reduced to the first class,\r\nthe civilized peoples. Another kind, totally opposed to the above,\r\nare the Negrillos, who live in the mountains and thick forests which\r\nabound in these islands. The latter are a barbarous race who live on\r\nthe fruits and roots of the forests. They go naked, covering only\r\nthe privies with some articles called bahaques, made from the bark\r\nof trees. They wear no other ornaments than armlets and anklets and\r\nbracelets, curiously wrought after their manner from small rattans\r\nof various colors, and garlands of branches and flowers on their\r\nheads and the fleshy parts of the arm; and at the most some cock\r\nor sparrow-hawk feather for a plume. They have no laws or letters,\r\nor other government or community than that of kinsfolk, all those\r\nof one line of family obeying their leader. In regard to religion\r\nand divine worship they have but little or none. The Spaniards call\r\nthem Negrillos because many of them are as much negroes, as are the\r\nEthiopians themselves, both in their black color and in their kinky\r\nhair. There are still a number of those people in the interior in\r\nthe mountains. In one of the large islands there are so many of them,\r\nthat it is for that reason called the island of Negros. Those blacks\r\nwere apparently the first inhabitants of these islands, and they have\r\nbeen deprived of them by the civilized nations who came later by way of\r\nSamatra, the Javas, Borney, Macaçar, and other islands lying toward the\r\nwest. If one should ask whence could come the Negros to these islands\r\nso distant from Africa and Ethiopias, where negroes live, I answer\r\nthat it was from nearer India, or citra Gangem, which was formerly\r\nsettled by Ethiopic negroes and was called Etiopia. [7] From there,\r\nit is more probable, went out the settlers of African Etiopia, as we\r\nprove in another place. Moreover, even today does India have nations\r\nof the negro race. Also they could easily pass from the districts of\r\nthe mainland of India to the nearest islands, and could come from\r\none to the other even as far as these Filipinas. In Nueva Guinea,\r\nwhich is quite near Terrenate, the natives are negroes like those of\r\nGuinea, and on that account the first explorers gave them that name;\r\nand they could also pass from those to these districts.\r\n\r\n30. There is another kind of people, neither so civilized as the\r\nfirst, nor so barbarous as the second. They generally live about\r\nthe sources of the rivers, and on that account are called in some\r\ndistricts, Ilayas. They are the Tingues, and are called Manguianes,\r\n[8] Zambals, or other names, for each island has a different name\r\nfor them. They generally trade with the Tagálogs, Visayans, and\r\nother civilized nations who are commonly settled near the sea and\r\nriver mouths. Although those Ilayas or Tingues are not Christians,\r\nthey pay some sort of recognition or tribute, and have their system\r\nof policy or government. It is thought that they are a mixture of the\r\nother barbarous and civilized nations, and for that reason they are\r\nmidway between the other two classes of peoples in color, clothing,\r\nand customs.\r\n\r\nWe do not pretend to deny by the above that some people could have\r\ncome from other parts and kingdoms of India extra Gangem (such as\r\nSian, Camboja, Cochinchina), and from China itself, and even Japon, to\r\nconquer and settle in parts of these islands--especially the Chinese,\r\nfrom whose histories, and their remains found in various parts,\r\nit is learned that in former times they were masters of all these\r\narchipelagoes. [9] If they were the first settlers of the Javas (as\r\nis told by Juan de Barros) they could still more easily have settled\r\nin some parts of these islands which are nearer to them.\r\n\r\nPersons who know the provinces of Ilocos and Cagayan, in the north\r\nof this island of Luzon, assert that they have discovered there the\r\ngraves of people larger than the Indians, and the arms and jewels of\r\nChinese or Japanese, who, it is presumed, conquered and settled in\r\nthose parts, led on by the desire for gold. [10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n    Of the nature, languages, and letters of the Filipinos\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the origin which we ascribed to the civilized\r\nnations of these islands in chapter four, so also are their capacity,\r\nlanguages, and letters. They are descendants of the Malays of the\r\nmainland of Malaca, whom they also resemble in their capacity,\r\nlanguages, and letters.\r\n\r\n92. From the shape, number, and use of the characters and letters of\r\nthis nation it is quite evident that they are all taken from the Moro\r\nMalays and originated from the Arabs. The vowel letters are only three\r\nin number, but they serve for five in their use; for the second and\r\nthird are indifferently e, i, y, o, and u, according as is required\r\nby the meaning or sense of the word which is spoken or written.\r\n\r\nThe consonants are thirteen in number, and serve (except at the\r\nbeginning of the phrase or initial letter) as consonant and vowel; for\r\nthe letter alone, without a dot above or below, is pronounced with \"A.\"\r\n\r\nIf a dot be placed above, the consonant is pronounced with \"e\" or \"i.\"\r\n\r\nIf the dot be placed below, it is pronounced with \"o\" or \"u.\" Thus the\r\n\"B\" with the dot above is pronounced \"bi\" or \"be,\" and with the dot\r\nbelow, \"bo\" or \"bu.\"\r\n\r\nFor example, in order to say \"cama\" [i.e., bed] the two letters \"C\"\r\nand \"M\" are sufficient without a dot.\r\n\r\nIf a dot be placed above the \"C\", it will be \"quema\" [i.e., \"fire\"].\r\n\r\nIf dots be placed below each, it will be \"como\" [i.e., \"as\"].\r\n\r\nThe final consonants are supplied in all expressions. Thus in order\r\nto say \"cantar\" [i.e., \"to sing\"], one writes \"cata,\" only a \"C\"\r\nand a \"T.\" To say \"barba\" [i.e., \"beard\"], two \"B's\" are sufficient.\r\n\r\nWith all the supplements, he who reads in that language will, if he be\r\nskilful, have no trouble in pronouncing the words or phrases correctly\r\nby substituting the letters that must be substituted according to the\r\nsense. But since that always occasions difficulty, those who know our\r\ncharacters are studying how to write their own language in these. All\r\nof them have now adopted our way of writing, with the lines from\r\nleft to right; for formerly they only wrote vertically down and up,\r\nplacing the first line to the left and running the others continuously\r\nto the right, just opposite to the Chinese and Japanese, who although\r\nthey write in vertical up and down lines, continue the page from the\r\nright to the left. All that points to a great antiquity; for running\r\nthe line from the right to the left is in accordance with the present\r\nand general style of the Hebrews; and the style of running the lines\r\nvertically from the top to the bottom, is that of the oldest nation\r\nof the Chinese--which doubtless greatly resembles the method of the\r\nHebrews, whose characters have much resemblance to theirs. Those of\r\nthe Moro Arabs resemble those of the Syrians. Diodorus Siculus, [11]\r\nwho wrote in the time of the emperor Cæsar Augustus, in making mention\r\nof an island which lay in our middle region, or torrid zone (whither\r\nIamblicus [12] the Greek went in the course of his adventures), says\r\nthat they do not write horizontally as we do, but from top to bottom\r\nin a straight line; and that they use characters which, although\r\nfew in number, make up in their use for many, for each one has four\r\ndifferent transformations. Consequently, one may see that that method\r\nof writing, and the characters of those nations, are very old. [13]\r\n\r\n93. Before they knew anything about paper (and even yet they do in\r\nplaces where they cannot get it), those people wrote on bamboos or\r\non palm-leaves, using as a pen the point of a knife or other bit of\r\niron, with which they engraved the letters on the smooth side of\r\nthe bamboo. If they write on palm-leaves they fold and then seal\r\nthe letter when written, in our manner. They all cling fondly to\r\ntheir own method of writing and reading. There is scarcely a man,\r\nand still less a woman, who does not know and practice that method,\r\neven those who are already Christians in matters of devotion. For\r\nfrom the sermons which they hear, and the histories and lives of\r\nthe saints, and the prayers and poems on divine matters, composed\r\nby themselves (they have also some perfect poets in their manner,\r\nwho translate elegantly into their language any Spanish comedy), they\r\nuse small books and prayerbooks in their language, and manuscripts\r\nwhich are in great number; as is affirmed in his manuscript history\r\nby Father Pedro Chirino, [14] to whom the provisor and vicar-general\r\nof this archbishopric entrusted the visit and examination of those\r\nbooks in the year one thousand six hundred and nine, for the purpose\r\nof preventing errors. That was a holy proceeding, and one that was\r\nvery proper among so new Christians.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos easily accustom themselves to the Spanish letters and\r\nmethod of writing. They are greatly benefited thereby, for many of\r\nthem write now just like us, because of their cleverness and quickness\r\nin imitating any letter or design, and in the doing of anything with\r\nthe hands. There are some of them who commonly serve as clerks in\r\nthe public accountancies and secretaryships of the kingdom. We have\r\nknown some so capable that they have deserved to become officials in\r\nthose posts, and perhaps to supply those offices ad interim. They\r\nalso are a great help to students in making clean copies of their\r\nrough drafts, not only in Romance but also in Latin, for there are\r\nalready some of them who have learned that language. Finally, they\r\nare the printers in the two printing-houses in this city of Manila;\r\nand they are entirely competent in that work, in which their skill\r\nand ability are very evident.\r\n\r\n94. Coming now to the other point, that of their languages, there are\r\nmany of these. For in this island of Manila alone there are six of\r\nthem, which correspond to the number of the provinces or civilized\r\nnations; the Tagálog, Pampanga, Camarines (or Visayan), Cagayan,\r\nand those of the Ilocans and Pangasinans. These are the civilized\r\nnations. We do not yet know the number of the nations of the Negrillos,\r\nZambals, and other mountain nations. Although the civilized languages\r\nare, strictly speaking, dissimilar, they resemble one another, so that\r\nin a short time those people can understand one another, and those of\r\nthe one nation can converse with those of another--in the same way\r\nas the Tuscan, Lombard, and Sicilian in Italia; and the Castilian,\r\nPortuguese, and language of Valencia in España. The reason why these\r\nlanguages resemble one another so closely is the same as in Italia\r\nand España. For as the latter languages originated from the Roman,\r\njust so do these originate from the Malay. For proof of that it is\r\nnecessary to do nothing else than to compare the words and idioms,\r\nor the modes of speech, of each one of these languages with the\r\nMalay, as will be seen in the following table, in which is made\r\nthe comparison of the three most important languages, the Tagálog,\r\nVisayan, and Pampanga. Since for the sake of brevity the comparison\r\nis made in a few words, whoever is interested can with but slight\r\nlabor extend the comparison through many words.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanish             Malay       Tagálog     Pampanga    Visayan\r\n\r\ncielo [i. e., sky]  langriet    lañgit      banoa       laguit\r\nsol [i. e., sun]    mata ari    arao        aldao       arlao\r\nluna [i. e., moon]  bulam       Bouan       bulan       bulan\r\n\r\n\r\nOf these languages the two most general are the Tagálog, which is\r\nused through the greater part of the coast and interior of the island\r\nof Manila, and the islands of Lubang and Mindoro; and the Visayan,\r\nwhich is spoken throughout all the islands of the Pintados. Of the\r\ntwo without doubt the most courteous, grave, artistic, and elegant\r\nis the Tagálog, for it shares in four qualities of the four greatest\r\nlanguages in the world, namely, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Spanish:\r\nWith the Hebrew, besides the resemblance already noted in the manner\r\nof its vowels and consonants, it has the roots of the vocables and\r\ntheir hidden and obscure meaning [sus preñezes, y misterios] and some\r\ngutturals; with the Greek, the articles in the declension of nouns, and\r\nin the conjugations the abundance of voices and moods; with the Latin,\r\nthe abundance and elegance; with the Spanish, the fine structure,\r\npolish, and courtesy. As a proof of this, Father Pedro Chirino has\r\ninserted in his printed relation of these islands an example in the\r\nprayer of the Ave Maria, [15] as a short and clear instance, with his\r\nexplanation, with notes in the following manner. It should be noted\r\nthat the father, belonging to a past age, wrote it in the old style,\r\nwhich has changed here somewhat since then, although not substantially.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE AVE MARIA IN THE TAGÁLOG LANGUAGE\r\n\r\n    Abe         Guingoong    Maria      matoua     ca     na\r\n    Ave         Señora      Maria       alegra     tu     ya\r\n    Hail        Lady        Mary        be joyful  thou   now\r\n\r\n    Napopono    ca      nang    gracia\r\n    Llena       tu      de      gracia\r\n    Full        thou    of      grace\r\n\r\n    Ang     Pañginoong  Dios    na         saiyo\r\n    El      Señor       Dios    està       contigo\r\n    The     Lord        God     is         with thee\r\n\r\n    Bucor       cang    pinagpala  sa      babaying   lahat\r\n    Singular    tu      bendita    entre   mugeres    todas\r\n    especially, thou    blessed    among   women      all\r\n\r\n    Pinagpala   naman     ang   yyong   Anac    si Jesus\r\n    Bendito     tambien   el    tu      Hijo    Jesus\r\n    blessed     also      he    thy     Son     Jesus\r\n\r\n    Santa   Mariang   Yna       nang    Dios\r\n    Santa   Maria     Madre     de      Dios\r\n    Holy    Mary,     Mother    of      God,\r\n\r\n    Ypanalangin         mo  caming  macasalanan ngayon\r\n    Seamos intercedidos de  ti      nosotros    pecadores agora\r\n    May we be           for by thee we sinners  now\r\n    interceded\r\n\r\n    At cum           mamatay    cami,       Amen Jesus.\r\n    Y cuando         muramos    nosotros.  [Amen Jesus].\r\n    And when         shall die  we.         Amen Jesus. [16]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first word, \"Aba\" is a mysterious one in the Tagálog, and has the\r\nforce of a salutation, as has \"Ave\" in Latin; and the same is true of\r\n\"Bucor\" which means \"diversity,\" \"distinction,\" and \"singularity.\" The\r\narticle is [seen in] \"si Jesus.\" Its abundance lies in the fact that\r\nit has many synonyms and turns of thought. Consequently, the above\r\nprayer, over and above being elegant, could also be expressed in\r\nseveral other ways just as elegant, and the same sense and meaning\r\nwould be kept. Its polish and courtesy consists in not saying \"Ave\r\nMaria\" as does the Latin--for that would be a lack of courtesy and\r\na barbarism in the Tagálog--but by the interposition of that polite\r\nword \"Guinoo.\" The Visayan [version] does not contain that word,\r\nas being a less polished language. However, I am not trying to cast\r\na slur on the latter for that reason, for each language has a beauty\r\nand elegance for its natives which does not strike the foreigner.\r\n\r\n95. Among the uncivilized nations, although the people are fewer, the\r\nlanguages are more; for almost every river has its own language. In\r\nMindoro (and the same will be true of other districts more remote) we\r\nsaw the barbarous Manguianes assembling from places but little distant\r\nfrom each other, who did not understand one another. They were so\r\nbarbarous that they had never seen a Spanish face. The things sent them\r\nto attract them were hawk's-bells, nails, needles, and other similar\r\nthings. They thought that the sounds of the harp and guitar were\r\nhuman voices. When a mirror was held up before them, they exhibited\r\nsingular effects, in one of fear and in another of joy. The lack of\r\ncivilization and communication is the reason for the multiplicity of\r\nlanguages. For just as in the primitive multiplication of languages\r\nwhich took place in the tower of Babel, the doctors observe that the\r\nlanguages equaled the number of the families of the descendants of\r\nNoah, so among the barbarous nations each one lives to itself alone\r\nwithout any recognition of or subjection to public laws. They are\r\nalways having petty wars and dissensions among themselves; and, since\r\nthey lack communication, they forget the common language, and each\r\none has so corrupted its own language that it cannot understand the\r\nothers. We observed in some districts that one language was spoken at\r\nthe mouth of a river and another one at its source. That is a great\r\nhindrance to the conversion and instruction of those peoples.\r\n\r\n96. The polish and courtesy, especially of the Tagálogs and those\r\nnear them, in speech and writing are the same as those of very\r\ncivilized nations. They never say \"tu\" [i.e., \"thou\"] or speak in the\r\nsecond person, singular or plural, but always in the third person:\r\n[thus], \"The chief would like this or that.\" Especially a woman when\r\naddressing a man, even though they be equal and of the middle class,\r\nnever say less than \"Sir\" or \"Master,\" and that after every word:\r\n\"When I was coming, sir, up the river, I saw, sir, etc.\" In writing\r\nthey make constant use of very fine and delicate expressions of regard,\r\nand beauties and courtesy. Their manner of salutation when they met one\r\nanother was the removal of the potong, which is a cloth like a crown,\r\nworn as we wear the hat. When an inferior addressed one of higher rank,\r\nthe courtesy used by him was to incline his body low, and then lift\r\none or both hands to the face, touch the cheeks with it, and at the\r\nsame time raise one of the feet in the air by doubling the knee, and\r\nthen seating oneself. The method of doing it was to fix the sole of\r\nthe feet firmly, and double both knees, without touching the ground,\r\nkeeping the body upright and the face raised. They bent in this manner\r\nwith the head uncovered and the potong thrown over the left shoulder\r\nlike a towel; they had to wait until they were questioned, for it\r\nwould be bad breeding to say anything until a question was asked.\r\n\r\n97. The method of giving names was the following. As soon as a\r\nchild was born, it was the mother's business to name it. Generally\r\nthe occasion or motive of the name was taken from some one of the\r\ncircumstances which occurred at the time. For example, Maliuag, which\r\nmeans \"difficult,\" because of the difficulty of the birth; Malacas,\r\nwhich signifies \"strong,\" for it is thought that the infant will be\r\nstrong. This is like the custom of the Hebrews, as appears from Holy\r\nWrit. At other times the name was given without any hidden meaning,\r\nfrom the first thing that struck the fancy, as Daan, which signifies\r\n\"road,\" and Damo, signifying \"grass.\" They were called by those names,\r\nwithout the use of any surname, until they were married. Then the first\r\nson or daughter gave the surname to the parents, as Amani Maliuag,\r\nYnani Malacas, \"the father of Maliuag,\" \"the mother of Malacas.\" The\r\nnames of women are differentiated from those of men by adding the\r\nsyllable \"in,\" as Ilog, \"river;\" Si Ilog, the name of a male; Si\r\nIloguin, the name of a female. They used very tender diminutives\r\nfor the children, in our manner. Among themselves they had certain\r\ndomestic and delicate appellations of various sorts for the different\r\ndegrees of relationship--as that of a child for his father and mother,\r\nand vice versa. In the same way [they have appellations] for their\r\nancestors, descendants, and collaterals. This shows the abundance,\r\nelegance, and courtesy of this language. It is a general thing in all\r\nthese nations not to have special family names which are perpetuated\r\nto their successors, but each individual has the simple name that\r\nis given him at birth. At present this name serves as surname,\r\nand the peculiar name is the Christian name of Juan or Pedro which\r\nis imposed at baptism. However, there are now mothers so Christian\r\nand civilized that they will not assign any secular name to their\r\nchildren until the Christian name has been given in baptism, [17]\r\nand then the surname is added, although it has already been chosen\r\nafter consultation with the parents and relatives. In place of our\r\n\"Don\" (which indeed has been assigned to them with as much abuse as\r\namong ourselves), in some districts they formerly placed before their\r\nnames, Lacan or Gat: as the Moluccans use Cachil, the Africans Muley,\r\nthe Turks Sultan, etc. The \"Don\" of the women is not Lacan or Gat, but\r\nDayang, Dayang Mati, Dayang Sanguy, i.e., \"Doña Mati,\" \"Doña Sanguy.\"\r\n\r\nThere is general distaste among our Tagálogs to mention one another\r\namong themselves by their own names alone, without adding something\r\nwhich smells of courtesy. When they are asked by the Spaniards \"Who is\r\nSo-and-so?\" and they cannot avoid naming him by his own name, they do\r\nit with a certain shamefacedness and embarrassment. Inasmuch as the\r\nmethod of naming one is \"the father of So-and-so,\" as soon as he has\r\nchildren, for him who had no children (among persons of influence)\r\nhis relatives and acquaintances assembled at a banquet, and gave him\r\na new name there, which they designated as Pamagat. That was usually\r\na name of excellence by some circumlocution or metaphor, based on\r\ntheir own old name. Thus if one was called by his own name, Bacal,\r\nwhich signifies \"iron,\" the new name given him would be Dimatanassan,\r\nsignifying \"not to spoil with time.\" If it were Bayani, which signifies\r\n\"valiant\" and \"spirited,\" he was called Dimalapitan \"he to whom no\r\none is bold.\" It is also the custom among these nations to call one\r\nanother among themselves, by way of friendship, by certain correlative\r\nnames based on some special circumstance. Thus if one had given a\r\nbranch of sweet basil to another, the two among themselves called\r\neach other Casolasi, the name of the thing given; or Caytlog, he who\r\nate of an egg with another. This is in the manner of the names of\r\nfellow-students or chums as used by us. These are all arguments in\r\nfavor of the civilization of these Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n    Of the appearance, features, clothing, and other ancient\r\n    customs of the natives of these islands\r\n\r\n\r\n98. The ordinary stature of these Indians is medium, but they are\r\nwell built and good-looking, both men and women. Their complexion is\r\nyellowish brown, like a boiled quince, and the beard is slight. The\r\nTagálogs wear the hair hanging to the shoulders; the Cagayans longer\r\nand hanging over the shoulders; the Ilocans shorter, and the Visayans\r\nstill shorter, for they cut it round in the manner of the oldtime\r\ncues of España. The nation called Zambals wear it shaved from the\r\nfront half of the head, while on the skull they have a great shock of\r\nloose hair. The complexion of the women in all the islands differs\r\nlittle from that of the men, except among the Visayans where some\r\nof the women are light-complexioned. All of the women wear the hair\r\ntied up in a knot on top of the head with a tasteful ribbon. Both\r\nmen and women, universally, consider it essential that the hair\r\nshould be very black and well cared for. For that purpose they use\r\nlotions made of certain tree-barks and oils, prepared with musk and\r\nother perfumes. Their greatest anxiety and care was the mouth, and\r\nfrom infancy they polished and filed the teeth so that they might\r\nbe even and pretty. They covered them with a coating of black ink or\r\nvarnish which aided in preserving them. Among the influential people,\r\nespecially the women, it was the custom to set some of the teeth most\r\nskilfully with gold which could not fall out, and gave a beautiful\r\nappearance. The men did not glory in their mustaches or beards,\r\nbut quite the contrary; and consequently they pulled them out on\r\npurpose. And just as it is an amusement or custom of some of us to\r\ngnaw our finger-nails, they get amusement in pulling out the hairs of\r\nthe beard with certain little bits of cleft bamboo [cañuelas hendidas]\r\nor with little shells in the form of pincers. All the women, and in\r\nsome places the men, adorn the ears with large rings or circlets of\r\ngold, for that purpose piercing them at an early age. Among the women\r\nthe more the ears were stretched and opened, so much greater was the\r\nbeauty. Some had two holes in each ear for two kinds of earrings,\r\nsome being larger than others.\r\n\r\n99. The men adorned the head with only cendal [18] or long and narrow\r\nthin cloth, with which they bound the forehead and temples, and which\r\nthey call potong. It was put on in different modes, now in the Moorish\r\nmanner like a turban without a bonnet, and now twisted and wrapped\r\nabout the head like the crown of a hat. Those who were esteemed as\r\nvaliant let the elaborately worked ends of the cloth fall down upon\r\ntheir shoulders, and these were so long that they reached the legs. By\r\nthe color of the cloth they displayed their rank, and it was the badge\r\nof their deeds and exploits; and it was not allowed to anyone to use\r\nthe red potong until he had at least killed one person. In order to\r\nwear it embroidered with certain borders, which were like a crown,\r\nthey must have killed seven. The personal clothing of those men was a\r\nsmall garment or short loose jacket [chamarreta] of fine linen which\r\nbarely reached the waist. It had no collar and was fitted formerly\r\nwith short sleeves. Among the chiefs those jackets were of a scarlet\r\ncolor, and were made of fine Indian muslin. For breeches they wore a\r\nrichly colored cloth, which was generally edged with gold, about the\r\nwaist and brought up between the legs, so that the legs were decently\r\ncovered to the middle of the thigh; from there down feet and legs\r\nwere bare. The chief adornments consisted of ornaments and jewels\r\nof gold and precious stones. They had various kinds of necklaces,\r\nand chains; bracelets or wristlets, also of gold and ivory, on the\r\narms as high as the elbow; while some had strings of cornelians,\r\nagates, and other stones which are highly esteemed among them. On the\r\nlegs, instead of garters, they wear some strings of the same stones,\r\nand certain cords of many strands, dyed black. The fingers of the\r\nhand are covered with many rings of gold and precious stones. The\r\nfinal complement of the gala attire was like our sash, a fine bit of\r\ncolored cloth crossed over the shoulder, the ends joined under the\r\narm, which they affected greatly. Instead of that the Visayans wore a\r\nrobe [marlota] or jacket [baquero] made without a collar and reaching\r\nquite down to the feet, and embroidered in colors. The entire dress,\r\nin fine, was in the Moorish style, and was truly rich and gay; and\r\neven today they affect it.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the women, besides the small shirt with sleeves already\r\nmentioned, which was shorter for them, for their gala dress had\r\nlittle modesty, was a skirt as wide at top as at bottom, which they\r\ngathered into folds at the waist, allowing the folds all to drop to\r\none side. This was long enough to cover them even to their feet, and\r\nwas generally white. When they went outside the house they wore for a\r\ncloak certain colored short cloaks, those of the principal women being\r\nof crimson silk or other cloths, embroidered with gold and adorned with\r\nrich fringe. But their principal gala attire consisted in jewels and\r\nornaments of gold and stones which they wore in their ears, and on the\r\nneck, the fingers of the hand and the wrists of the arms. But now they\r\nhave begun to wear the Spanish clothes and ornaments, namely, chains,\r\nnecklaces, skirts, shoes, and mantillas, or black veils. The men wear\r\nhats, short jackets [ropillas], breeches, and shoes. Consequently, the\r\npresent dress of the Indians in these regions is now almost Spanish.\r\n\r\n110 [i.e., 100]. Besides the exterior clothing and dress, some of\r\nthese nations wore another inside dress, which could not be removed\r\nafter it was once put on. These are the tattooings of the body so\r\ngreatly practiced among the Visayans, whom we call Pintados for that\r\nreason. For it was a custom among them, and was a mark of nobility and\r\nbravery, to tattoo the whole body from top to toe when they were of an\r\nage and strength sufficient to endure the tortures of the tattooing,\r\nwhich was done (after being carefully designed by the artists, and\r\nin accordance with the proportion of the parts of the body and the\r\nsex) with instruments like brushes or small twigs, with very fine\r\npoints of bamboo. The body was pricked and marked with them until\r\nblood was drawn. Upon that a black powder or soot made from pitch,\r\nwhich never faded, was put on. The whole body was not tattooed at\r\none time, but it was done gradually. In olden times no tattooing was\r\nbegun until some brave deed had been performed; and after that, for\r\neach one of the parts of the body which was tattooed some new deed\r\nhad to be performed. The men tattooed even their chins and about the\r\neyes so that they appeared to be masked. Children were not tattooed,\r\nand the women only on one hand and part of the other. The Ilocans in\r\nthis island of Manila also tattooed themselves but not to the same\r\nextent as the Visayans. The dress of both men and women among the\r\nIlocans is almost alike in that province. Thus far the dress. We\r\nshall now say somewhat of the food and their customs in eating.\r\n\r\n101. Their usual sustenance is as stated above, rice, well hulled and\r\ncleaned, and boiled only with water, which is called morisqueta by the\r\nSpaniards, as if to call it \"food of the Moors.\" The meat is that of a\r\nsmall fish which is lacking in no part. That is also boiled in water,\r\nand with the broth from it, they give a flavor to the morisqueta. For\r\nlack of rice and fish they use the herbs and many kinds of native\r\npotatoes, and fruits, by which they are sustained well enough. At their\r\nbanquets they add venison, pork, or beef, which they like best when\r\nit has begun to spoil, and to smell bad. Their manner of eating is,\r\nto be seated on the ground. Their tables are small and low, round or\r\nsquare, and they have no tablecloths or napkins; but the plates with\r\nthe food are placed on the same tables. They eat in companies of four\r\nwhich is as many as can get around a small table. On the occasion\r\nof a wedding or a funeral, or similar feasts, the whole house will\r\nbe filled with tables and guests. The food is placed all together on\r\nvarious plates. The people do not shun all reaching out to the same\r\nplate, or drinking from the same cup. They relish salt, and salty\r\nand acid foods. They have no better dainty for the sick than vinegar\r\nand green or pickled fruits. They eat sparingly but drink often; and\r\nwhen they are invited to a banquet, they are asked not to eat but to\r\ndrink. They waste much time in both eating and drinking. When they\r\nhave enough and are drunk, the tables are taken away and the house is\r\ncleared. If the banquet is the occasion of a feast, they sing, play,\r\nand dance. They spend a day and a night in this, amid great racket\r\nand cries, until they fall with weariness and sleep. But rarely do\r\nthey become furious or even foolish; on the contrary, after they have\r\ntaken wine they preserve due respect and discreet behavior. They only\r\nwax more cheerful, and converse better and say some witty things;\r\nand it is well known that no one of them when he leaves a banquet,\r\nalthough it be at any hour of the night, fails to go straight to his\r\nown house. And if he has occasion to buy or sell, and to examine and\r\nweigh gold or silver he does it with so great steadiness that the\r\nhand does not tremble, nor does he make any error in the weight.\r\n\r\n102. The wine commonly used among them is either that made from\r\npalms, as it is throughout India, or from sugar-cane, which they call\r\nquilang. The latter is made by extracting the sap from the canes,\r\nand then bringing it to a boil over the fire, so that it becomes like\r\nred wine, although it does not taste so good. The palm wine is made by\r\nextracting the sap or liquor from which the fruit was to be formed. For\r\nas soon as the palm begins to send out the shoot from the end of the\r\ntwig, and before the flower is unfolded, that flower-stock is cut,\r\nand a bit of bamboo is fastened to it and is tied to the stalk or\r\nshoot. Since the sap naturally flows to that part, as in the pruned\r\nvine, all the sap that was to be converted into fruit, flows into\r\nthat bamboo, and passes through it to vessels, where, somewhat sour\r\nand steeped with the bark of certain trees which give it color, heat,\r\nand bite, they use it as a common drink and call it tuba. But the\r\nreal and proper palm-wine is made from the same liquor before it turns\r\nsour, by distilling it in an alembic in ovens that they have prepared\r\nfor it. They give it a greater or less strength, as they please;\r\nand they get a brandy as clear as water, although it is not so hot\r\n[as our brandy]. [19] It is of a dry quality, and, when used with\r\nmoderation, it is considered even outside Filipinas as healthful and\r\nmedicinal for the stomach and a preventive of watery humors and colds.\r\n\r\nThe Visayans also make a wine, called pañgasi, from rice. The method\r\nof making it is to place in the bottom of a jar of ordinary size\r\n(which is generally of two or three arrobas, with them) a quantity\r\nof yeast made from rice flour and a certain plant. Atop of that they\r\nput clean rice until the jar is half full. Then water is added to it,\r\nand, after it has stood for a few days, it is fermented by the force\r\nof the yeast, and is converted into the strongest kind of wine, which\r\nis not liquid, but thick like gachas. [20] In order to drink it they\r\npour water into the jar. It is a cause for surprise that even though\r\nwater be poured in again and again, the liquor is pure and liquid\r\nwine, until the strength vanishes and is lost, and then they leave\r\nit for the children. The method of drinking it is with a tube, which\r\nthey insert clear to the bottom where the yeast is. They use three\r\nor four of those tubes, according to the number of the persons who\r\ncan find room around the vessel. They suck up as much as they wish,\r\nand then give place to others.\r\n\r\n103. The banquets are interspersed with singing, in which one or two\r\nsing and the others respond. The songs [21] are usually their old\r\nsongs and fables, as is usual with other nations. The dances of men\r\nand women are generally performed to the sound of bells which are made\r\nin their style like basins, large or small, of metal, and the sounds\r\nare brought out quickly and uninterruptedly. For the dance is warlike\r\nand passionate, but it has steps and measured changes, and interposed\r\nare some elevations that really enrapture and surprise. They generally\r\nhold in the hands a towel, or a spear and shield, and with one and the\r\nother they make their gestures in time, which are full of meaning. At\r\nother times with the hands empty they make movements which correspond\r\nto the movements of the feet, now slow, now rapid. Now they attack\r\nand retire; now they incite; now they pacify; now they come close;\r\nnow they go away: all the grace and elegance, so much, in fact, that\r\nat times they have not been judged unworthy to accompany and solemnize\r\nour Christian feasts. [22] However, the children and youths now dance,\r\nplay, and sing in our manner and so well that we cannot do it better.\r\n\r\nThey had a kind of guitar which was called coryapi, which had two or\r\nmore copper strings. Although its music is not very artistic or fine,\r\nit does not fail to be agreeable, especially to them. They play it\r\nwith a quill, with great liveliness and skill. It is a fact that,\r\nby playing it alone, they carry on a conversation and make understood\r\nwhatever they wish to say.\r\n\r\n104. All of these islanders are extremely fond of the water for bathing\r\npurposes, and as a consequence they try to settle on the shores of\r\nrivers or creeks, for the more they are in the water the better they\r\nlike it. They bathe at all times, for pleasure and cleanliness. When\r\nan infant is born, it is put into the river and bathed in cold water;\r\nand the mother, after having given birth, does not keep away from the\r\nwater. The manner of bathing is, to stand with the body contracted\r\nand almost seated, with the water up to the throat. The most usual and\r\ngeneral hour is at sunset, when the people leave work or return from\r\nthe field, and bathe for rest and coolness. Men and women all swim\r\nlike fish, and as if born and reared in the water. Each house has a\r\nvessel of water at the door. Whenever any one goes up to the house,\r\nwhether an inmate of it or not, he takes water from that vessel to\r\nwash his feet, especially when it is muddy. That is done very easily;\r\none foot is dried with the other, and the water falls down below,\r\nfor the floor there is like a close grating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n    Of the false heathen religion, idolatries, superstitions,\r\n    and other things, of the Filipinos\r\n\r\n\r\n105. It is not found that these nations had anything written about\r\ntheir religion or about their government, or of their old-time\r\nhistory. All that we have been able to learn has been handed down from\r\nfather to son in tradition, and is preserved in their customs; and in\r\nsome songs that they retain in their memory and repeat when they go on\r\nthe sea, sung to the time of their rowing, and in their merrymakings,\r\nfeasts, and funerals, and even in their work, when many of them work\r\ntogether. In those songs are recounted the fabulous genealogies and\r\nvain deeds of their gods. Among their gods is one who is the chief and\r\nsuperior to all the others, whom the Tagálogs call Bathala Meycapal,\r\n[23] which signifies \"God\" the \"Creator\" or \"Maker.\" The Visayans\r\ncall him Laon, which denotes \"antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nThey adored (as did the Egyptians) animals and birds; and the sun and\r\nmoon, as did the Assyrians. They also attributed to the rainbow its\r\nkind of divinity. The Tagálogs worshiped a blue bird as large as a\r\nturtle-dove, which they called tigmamanuquin, to which they attributed\r\nthe name of Bathala, which, as above stated, was among them a name for\r\ndivinity. They worshiped the crow, as the ancients did the god Pan\r\nor the goddess Ceres, and called it Meylupa, signifying \"master of\r\nthe earth.\" They held the crocodile in the greatest veneration, and\r\nwhen they saw it in the water cried out, in all subjection, \"Nono,\"\r\nsignifying \"Grandfather.\" They asked it pleasantly and tenderly not\r\nto harm them, and for that purpose offered it a portion of what they\r\ncarried in their boat, by throwing it into the water. There was no\r\nold tree to which they did not attribute divine honors, and it was a\r\nsacrilege to think of cutting it under any consideration. Even the\r\nvery rocks, crags, reefs, and points along the seashore and rivers\r\nwere adored, and an offering made to them on passing, by stopping\r\nthere and placing the offering upon the rock or reef. The river of\r\nManila had a rock that served as an idol of that wretched people for\r\nmany years, and its scandal lasted and it gave rise to many evils,\r\nuntil the fathers of St. Augustine, who were near there, broke it,\r\nthrough their holy zeal, into small bits and set up a cross in its\r\nplace. Today there is an image of St. Nicholas of Tolentino in that\r\nplace, in a small shrine or chapel. When sailing to the island of\r\nPanay, one saw on the point called Nasso, near Potol, a rock upon\r\nwhich were dishes and other pieces of crockery-ware, which were\r\noffered to it by those who went on the sea. In the island of Mindanao,\r\nbetween La Caldera and the river, there is a great point of land, on\r\na rough and very high coast. The sea is forever dashing against these\r\nheadlands, and it is difficult and dangerous to double them. When\r\nthe people passed by that one, as it was so high, they offered it\r\narrows, which they shot at the cliff itself with so great force that\r\nthey stuck there, offering them as if in sacrifice so that it would\r\nallow them to pass. There were so many of those arrows that, although\r\nthe Spaniards set fire to them and burned a countless number of them\r\nin hatred of so cursed a superstition, many remained there, and the\r\nnumber increased in less than one year to more than four thousand.\r\n\r\n106. They also adored private idols, which each one inherited from\r\nhis ancestors. The Visayans called them divata, and the Tagálogs\r\nanito. Of those idols some had jurisdiction over the mountains and open\r\ncountry, and permission was asked from them to go thither. Others had\r\njurisdiction over the sowed fields, and the fields were commended to\r\nthem so that they might prove fruitful; and besides the sacrifices\r\nthey placed articles of food in the fields for the anitos to eat,\r\nin order to place them under greater obligations. There was an anito\r\nof the sea, to whom they commended their fisheries and navigations;\r\nan anito of the house, whose favor they implored whenever an infant\r\nwas born, and when it was suckled and the breast offered to it. They\r\nplaced their ancestors, the invocation of whom was the first thing in\r\nall their work and dangers, among these anitos. In memory of their\r\nancestors they kept certain very small and very badly made idols of\r\nstone, wood, gold, or ivory, called licha or laravan. Among their gods\r\nthey reckoned also all those who perished by the sword, or who were\r\ndevoured by crocodiles, as well as those killed by lightning. They\r\nthought that the souls of such immediately ascended to the blest\r\nabode by means of the rainbow, called by them balañgao. Generally,\r\nwhoever could succeed in it attributed divinity to his aged father\r\nat his death. The aged themselves died in that presumptuous delusion,\r\nand during their sickness and at their death guided all their actions\r\nwith what they imagined a divine gravity and manner. Consequently, they\r\nchose as the place for their grave some assigned spot, [24] like one\r\nold man who lived on the seacoast between Dulac and Abuyog, which is in\r\nthe island of Leyte. He ordered himself placed there in his coffin (as\r\nwas done) in a house standing alone and distant from the settlement,\r\nin order that he might be recognized as a god of navigators, who were\r\nto commend themselves to him. Another had himself buried in certain\r\nlands in the mountains of Antipolo, and through reverence to him\r\nno one dared to cultivate those lands (for they feared that he who\r\nshould do so would die), until an evangelical minister removed that\r\nfear from them, and now they cultivate them without harm or fear.\r\n\r\n107. They mentioned the creation of the world, the beginning of the\r\nhuman race, the flood, glory, punishment, and other invisible things,\r\nsuch as evil spirits and devils. They recognized the latter to be\r\nman's enemy, and hence feared them. By the beginning which they\r\nassigned to the world and the human race, will be seen the vanity\r\nof their belief, and that it is all lies and fables. They say that\r\nthe world began with only the sky and water, between which was a\r\nkite. Tired of flying and not having any place where it could alight,\r\nthe kite stirred up the water against the sky. The sky, in order to\r\nrestrain the water and prevent it from mounting to it, burdened it with\r\nislands; and also ordered the kite to light and build its nest on them,\r\nand leave them in peace. They said that men had come from the stem\r\nof a large bamboo (such as one sees in this Orient), which had only\r\ntwo nodules. That bamboo, floating on the water, was carried by the\r\nwaves to the feet of the kite, which was on the seacoast. The kite,\r\nin anger at what had struck its feet, opened the bamboo by picking it\r\nwith its beak. When it was opened, out of one nodule came man and from\r\nthe other woman. After various difficulties because of the obstacle\r\nof consanguinity in the first degree, one of the gods namely, the\r\nearthquake, after consulting with the fish and birds, absolved them,\r\nand they married and had many children. From those children came the\r\nvarious kinds and classes of people. For it happened that the parents,\r\nangered at having so many children idle and useless in the house,\r\ntook counsel together; afterward the father one day gave way to his\r\nanger, and was desirous of punishing them with a stick which he had\r\nin his hand (a thing which they can never do). The children fled,\r\nso that some of them took refuge in the chambers and innermost parts\r\nof the house, from whom they say came the chiefs; others escaped\r\noutside, and from them came the freemen, whom they call timauas;\r\nothers fled to the kitchen and lower parts, and they are the slaves;\r\nothers fled to various distant places, and they are the other nations.\r\n\r\n108. It is not known whether there was any temple [25] in all these\r\nislands, or any place assigned in common for worship; or that the\r\npeople ever assembled for public functions. In private they were\r\nwont to have in their own houses (and not outside them in any cave\r\nor like place) some kind of altars, on which they placed their idols,\r\nand before them a small brasier with burning aromatics. But although\r\nthey had no temples, they did not lack priests or priestesses\r\nfor the sacrifices, which each one offered for his own purpose or\r\nnecessity. The Tagálogs called those cursed ministers catalonan,\r\nand the Visayans babaylan. Some were priests by inheritance and\r\nrelationship; others by the dexterity with which they caused themselves\r\nto be instructed and substituted in the office of famous priests by\r\ngaining their good-will. Others were deceived by the devil with his\r\nwonted wiles, and made a pact with him to assist them, and to hold\r\nconverse with him through their idols or anitos; and he appeared to\r\nthem in various forms. The method of making the sacrifices hinged\r\non the different purposes for which they were intended. If it were\r\nfor a feast of ostentation and vanity that was being made to some\r\nchief, they called it \"the feast of the great god.\" The method of\r\ncelebrating it was near the house of the chief, in a leafy bower\r\nwhich they erected especially for that purpose, hung round about\r\nwith hangings in their fashion, namely, the Moorish, which were made\r\nfrom odds and ends of pieces, of various colors. The guests assembled\r\nthere, and the sacrifice having been prepared (on those occasions of\r\na feast usually some good fat pig), the catalona ordered the girl of\r\nthe best appearance and who was best adorned, to give the spear-thrust\r\nto the animal, amid the ceremony of certain dances of theirs. When the\r\nanimal was dead it was cut into bits and divided among all the people,\r\nas is the blessed bread. Although other animals were killed and eaten,\r\nand other viands and refreshments peculiar to those people were used,\r\nthat animal was the one esteemed and was reverently consumed. The\r\nchief part of the feast was the drinking, accompanied, as ever,\r\nwith much music and dancing.\r\n\r\n109. If the sacrifice was because of the danger of death in the\r\nhouse of sickness, the minister ordered that a new, large, and\r\ncapacious house be built at the expense of the sick person, in which\r\nto celebrate the feast. That work was performed in a trice, as the\r\nmaterials were at hand and all the neighbors took part in it. When\r\nit was finished, the sick person was taken to the new lodging. Then\r\npreparing the intended sacrifice--a slave (which was their custom at\r\ntimes), a turtle, a large shellfish, or a hog--without an altar or\r\nanything resembling one, they placed it near the sick person, who\r\nwas stretched out on the floor of the house on a palm mat (which\r\nthey use as a mattress). They also set many small tables there,\r\nladen with various viands. The catalona stepped out, and, dancing\r\nto the sound of gongs, wounded the animal, and anointed with the\r\nblood the sick person, as well as some of the bystanders. The animal\r\nwas then drawn slightly to one side and skinned and cleaned. After\r\nthat it was taken back to its first location, and the catalona there\r\nbefore them all, spoke some words between her teeth while she opened\r\nit, and took out and examined the entrails, in the manner of the\r\nancient soothsayers. Besides that the devil became incarnate in her,\r\nor the catalona feigned to be him by grimaces, and shaking of the\r\nfeet and hands, and foamings at the mouth, acting as if out of her\r\nsenses. After she had returned to her senses, she prophesied to the\r\nsick person what would happen to him. If the prophecy was one of life,\r\nthe people ate and drank, chanted the histories of the ancestors of\r\nthe sick person and of the anito to which the sacrifice was being\r\nmade, and danced until they fell through sheer exhaustion. If the\r\nprophecy was one of death, the prophetess bolstered up her bad news\r\nwith praises of the sick person, for whose virtues and prowess she\r\nsaid the anitos had chosen him to become one of them. From that\r\ntime she commended herself to him and all his family, begging him\r\nto remember her in the other life. She added other flatteries and\r\nlies, with which she made the poor sick person swallow his death;\r\nand obliged his relatives and friends to treat him from that time as\r\nan anito, and make feasts to him. The end was eating and drinking,\r\nfor that marked the termination of their sacrifices. Each person who\r\nattended the sacrifice was obliged to offer something--gold, cotton,\r\nbirds, or other things--according to his capacity and wish. The\r\noffering was given to the priest or priestess who had performed the\r\nsacrifice. Consequently, the latter were generally quite rich and\r\nwell dressed, and had plenty of ornaments made of various kinds of\r\njewels. On that account, however, they were not honored or esteemed;\r\nfor they were considered as an idle lot, who lived by the sweat of\r\nothers. After their duty was once performed no further attention was\r\npaid to them, unless they united with their office nobility or power.\r\n\r\n110. To give a list of the omens and auguries would consume much time\r\nand be useless. If the owl lit on the roof at night it was a sign of\r\ndeath. Consequently, when a house was built some sort of scarecrow\r\nwas set up to keep that bird away, so that the house might not be\r\nlost; for a house would under no circumstances be lived in if that\r\nhappened. The same was true if any serpent was seen in it after it had\r\nbeen newly built. If they came across a serpent in any road they would\r\nnot proceed farther, even if their business was very pressing. The\r\nsame was true if they heard any one sneeze, a rat squeal, a dog howl,\r\nor a lizard [26] sing. Fishermen would not make use of the first cast\r\nof the net or a new fish-corral, for they thought that they would get\r\nno more fish if they did the opposite. Neither must one talk in the\r\nfisherman's house of his new nets, or in that of the hunter of dogs\r\nrecently purchased, until they had made a capture or had some good\r\nluck; for if they did not observe that, the virtue was taken from the\r\nnets and the cunning from the dogs. A pregnant woman could not cut\r\noff her hair, under penalty of bearing an infant without hair. Those\r\nwho journeyed ashore could not mention anything of the sea; and those\r\nwho voyaged on the sea could not take any land animal with them, or\r\neven name it. When a voyage was begun they rocked the boat to and fro,\r\nand let it vibrate, and if the vibrations of the right side were more\r\npronounced the voyage would be good, but if bad they were less. They\r\ncast lots with some strands of cord, with the tusks of swine, the teeth\r\nof crocodiles, and other filthy things, at the ends; and their good or\r\nevil fortune would depend on whether or not those ends became tangled.\r\n\r\n111. The oaths of these nations were all execrations in the form of\r\nawful curses. Matay, \"may I die!\" Cagtin nang Buaya, \"may I be eaten\r\nby the crocodile!\" Maguin Amo, \"may I turn into a monkey!\" The one\r\ngenerally used is Matay. When the chiefs of Manila and Tondo swore\r\nallegiance to our Catholic sovereigns, in the year one thousand five\r\nhundred and seventy-one, they confirmed the peace agreements and the\r\nsubjection with an oath, asking \"the sun to pierce them through the\r\nmiddle, the crocodiles to eat them, and the women not to show them\r\nany favor or wish them well, if they broke their word.\" Sometimes\r\nthey performed the pasambahan for greater solemnity and confirmation\r\nof the oath. That consisted in bringing forward the figure of some\r\nmonstrous beast asking that they might be broken into pieces by it if\r\nthey failed in their promise. Others, having placed a lighted candle\r\nin front of them, said that as that candle melted and was consumed,\r\nso might he who failed in his promise be consumed and destroyed. Such\r\nas these were their oaths.\r\n\r\n112. It remains for us to speak of their mortuary customs. As soon as\r\nthe sick person dies, they begin to bewail him with sobs and cries--not\r\nonly the relatives and friends, but also those who have that as a trade\r\nand hire themselves out for that purpose. They put into their song\r\ninnumerable bits of nonsense in praise of the deceased. To the sound of\r\nthat sad music, they washed the body. They perfumed it with storax, or\r\nbenzoin, and other perfumes, obtained from tree-resins which are found\r\nthroughout these forests. Having done that they shrouded the corpse,\r\nwrapping it in a greater or less number of cloths, according to the\r\nrank of the deceased. The most powerful were anointed and embalmed\r\naccording to the manner of the Hebrews, with aromatic liquors which\r\npreserve the body from corruption, especially that made from the aloes\r\nwood, or as it is called, eagle-wood. That wood is much esteemed\r\nand greatly used throughout this India extra Gangem. The sap from\r\nthe plant called buyo (which is the famous betel of all India) was\r\nalso used for that purpose. A quantity of that sap was placed in the\r\nmouth so that it would reach the interior. The grave of poor people\r\nwas a hole in the ground under their own houses. After the rich and\r\npowerful were bewailed for three days, they were placed in a box or\r\ncoffin of incorruptible wood, the body adorned with rich jewels, and\r\nwith sheets of gold over the mouth and eyes. The box of the coffin was\r\nall of one piece, and was generally dug out of the trunk of a large\r\ntree, and the lid was so adjusted that no air could enter. By such\r\nmeans some bodies have been found uncorrupted after the lapse of many\r\nyears. Those coffins were placed in one of three places, according to\r\nthe inclination and command of the deceased. That place was either\r\nin the upper part of the house with the jewels, which are generally\r\nkept there; or in the lower part of it, raised up from the ground;\r\nor in the ground itself, in an open hole which is surrounded with a\r\nsmall railing, without covering the coffin over with earth. Near it\r\nthey generally placed another box filled with the best clothing of the\r\ndeceased, and at suitable times various kinds of food were placed on\r\ndishes for them. Beside the men were placed the weapons, and beside\r\nthe women their looms or other instruments of labor. If they were\r\nmuch beloved by those who bewailed them, they were not permitted\r\nto go alone. A good meal was given to some slave, male or female,\r\nand one of those most liked by the deceased; and then he was killed,\r\nin order that he might accompany the deceased. Shortly before the\r\nentrance of the faith into the island of Bool, one of the chiefs of\r\nthat island had himself buried in a kind of boat, which the natives\r\ncall barangay, surrounded by seventy slaves with arms, ammunition,\r\nand food--just as he was wont to go out upon his raids and robberies\r\nwhen in life; and as if he were to be as great a pirate in the other\r\nlife as in this. Others buried their dead in the open country, and\r\nmade fires for many days under the house, and set guards so that the\r\ndeceased should not return to carry away those who had remained.\r\n\r\n113. After the funeral the lamentations ceased, although the eating\r\nand drunkenness did not. On the contrary, the latter continued for a\r\ngreater or less time, according to the rank of the deceased. The widow\r\nor widower and the orphans, and other relatives, who were most affected\r\nby grief, fasted as a sign of mourning, and abstained from flesh, fish,\r\nand other food, eating during those days naught but vegetables, and\r\nthose only sparingly. That manner of fasting or penitence for the dead\r\nis called sipà by the Tagálogs. Mourning among the Tagálogs is black,\r\nand among the Visayans white, and in addition the Visayans shave the\r\nhead and eyebrows. At the death of a chief silence must reign in the\r\nvillage until the interdict was raised; and that lasted a greater or\r\nless number of days, according to his rank. During that time no sound\r\nor noise was to be heard anywhere, under penalty of infamy. In regard\r\nto this even the villages along the river-bank placed a certain signal\r\naloft, so that no one might sail by that side, or enter or leave the\r\nvillage, under penalty of death. They deprived anyone who broke that\r\nsilence of his life, with the greatest cruelty and violence. Those\r\nwho were killed in war were celebrated in their lamentations and in\r\ntheir funeral rites, and much time was spent in offering sacrifices\r\nto or for them, accompanied with many banquets and drunken revels. If\r\nthe death had happened through violence--in war or peace, by treason,\r\nor any other manner--the mourning was not laid aside nor the interdict\r\nraised until the children, brothers, or relatives, killed an equal\r\nnumber not only of their enemies and the murderers, but also of\r\nany strange persons who were not their friends. Like highwaymen and\r\nrobbers they prowled on land and sea, and went on the hunt for men,\r\nkilling as many as they could until their fury was appeased. That\r\nbarbarous kind of vengeance is called balàta and in token of it the\r\nneck was girt with a strap which was worn until the number of persons\r\nprescribed had been killed. Then a great feast and banquet was made,\r\nthe interdict was raised, and at its proper time the mourning was\r\nremoved. In all the above are clearly seen the traces of heathendom\r\nand of those ancient rites and customs so celebrated and noised\r\nabout by good authors, by which many other nations, more civilized,\r\nwere considered as famous and worthy of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n    Of the government and political customs of these peoples\r\n\r\n\r\n114. There were no kings or rulers worthy of mention, throughout this\r\narchipelago; but there were many chiefs who dominated others less\r\npowerful. As there were many without much power, there was no security\r\nfrom the continual wars that were waged between them. Manila had two\r\nchiefs, uncle and nephew, who had equal power and authority. They\r\nwere at war with another chief, who was chief alone; and he was so\r\nnear that they were separated from one another by nothing more than\r\na not very wide river. The same conditions ruled in all the rest of\r\nthe island, and of even the whole archipelago, until the entrance\r\nof the faith, when they were given peace--which they now esteem\r\nmuch more than all that they then obtained from those petty wars\r\nand their depredations. They were divided into barangays, as Roma\r\ninto districts, and our cities into parishes or collations. They are\r\ncalled barangays, which is the name of a boat, preserving the name from\r\nthe boat in which they came to settle these islands. Since they came\r\nsubject to one leader in their barangay, who acted as their captain\r\nor pilot--who was accompanied by his children, relatives, friends,\r\nand comrades--after landing, they kept in company under that leader,\r\nwho is the dato. Seizing the lands, they began to cultivate them\r\nand to make use of them. They seized as much of the sea and near-by\r\nrivers as they could preserve and defend from any other barangay, or\r\nfrom many barangays, according as they had settled near or far from\r\nothers. Although on all occasions some barangays aided and protected\r\nothers, yet the slave or even the timaua or freemen could not pass from\r\none barangay to another, especially a married man or a married woman,\r\nwithout paying a certain quantity of gold, and giving a public feast\r\nto his whole barangay; where this was not done, it was an occasion\r\nfor war between the two barangays. If a man of one barangay happened\r\nto marry a woman of another, the children had to be divided between\r\nthe barangays, in the same manner as the slaves.\r\n\r\n115. Their laws and policy, which were not very barbarous for\r\nbarbarians, consisted wholly of traditions and customs, observed\r\nwith so great exactness that it was not considered possible to break\r\nthem in any circumstance. One was the respect of parents and elders,\r\ncarried to so great a degree that not even the name of one's father\r\ncould pass the lips, in the same way as the Hebrews [regarded] the\r\nname of God. The individuals, even the children, must follow the\r\ngeneral [custom]. There were other laws also. For the determination\r\nof their suits, both civil and criminal, there was no other judge\r\nthan the said chief, with the assistance of some old men of the\r\nsame barangay. With them the suit was determined in the following\r\nform. They had the opponents summoned, and endeavored to have them\r\ncome to an agreement. But if they would not agree, then an oath was\r\nadministered to each one, to the effect that he would abide by what\r\nwas determined and done. Then they called for witnesses, and examined\r\nsummarily. If the proof was equal [on both sides], the difference was\r\nsplit; but, if it were unequal, the sentence was given in favor of the\r\none who conquered. If the one who was defeated resisted, the judge\r\nmade himself a party to the cause, and all of them at once attacked\r\nwith the armed hand the one defeated, and execution to the required\r\namount was levied upon him. The judge received the larger share of\r\nthis amount, and some was paid to the witnesses of the one who won\r\nthe suit, while the poor litigant received the least.\r\n\r\nIn criminal causes there were wide distinctions made because of the\r\nrank of the murderer and the slain; and if the latter were a chief\r\nall his kinsmen went to hunt for the murderer and his relatives,\r\nand both sides engaged in war, until mediators undertook to declare\r\nthe quantity of gold due for that murder, in accordance with the\r\nappraisals which the old men said ought to be paid according to\r\ntheir custom. One half of that amount belonged to the chiefs, and the\r\nother half was divided among the wife, children, and relatives of the\r\ndeceased. The penalty of death was never imposed by process of law,\r\nexcept when the murderer and his victim were common men and had no gold\r\nto satisfy the murder. In such a case, if the man's dato or maginoo\r\n(for these are one and the same) did not kill him, the other chiefs\r\ndid, spearing him after lashing him to a stake.\r\n\r\n117. In a matter of theft, if the crime were proved, but not the\r\ncriminal, and more than one person was suspected, a canonical\r\nclearance from guilt had to be made in the following form. First\r\nthey obliged each person to put in a heap a bundle of cloth, leaves,\r\nor anything else that they wished, in which they might discover\r\nthe article stolen. If the article stolen was found in the heap,\r\nat the end of this effort, then the suit ceased; if not, one of\r\nthree methods was tried. First, they were placed in the part of\r\nthe river where it is deepest, each one with his wooden spear in\r\nhis hand. Then at the same time they were all to be plunged under\r\nthe water, for all are equal in this, and he who came out first was\r\nregarded as the criminal. Consequently, many let themselves drown\r\nfor fear of punishment. The second was to place a stone in a vessel\r\nof boiling water, and to order them to take it out. He who refused to\r\nput his hand into the water paid the penalty for the theft. Thirdly,\r\neach one was given a wax candle of the same wick, and of equal size\r\nand weight. The candles were lighted at the same time, and he whose\r\ncandle first went out was the culprit.\r\n\r\n118. There are three kinds and classes of people: the chiefs, whom\r\nthe Visayans call dato and the Tagálogs maginoo; the timauas, who\r\nare the ordinary common people, called maharlicà among the Tagálogs;\r\nand the slaves, called oripuen by the Visayans and alipin by the\r\nTagálogs. The last are divided into several kinds, as we shall relate\r\nsoon. The chiefs attain that position generally through their blood;\r\nor, if not that, because of their energy and strength. For even though\r\none may be of low extraction, if he is seen to be careful, and if he\r\ngains some wealth by his industry and schemes--whether by farming and\r\nstock-raising, or by trading; or by any of the trades among them, such\r\nas smith, jeweler, or carpenter; or by robbery and tyranny, which was\r\nthe most usual method--in that way he gains authority and reputation,\r\nand increases it the more he practices tyranny and violence. With\r\nthese beginnings, he takes the name of dato; and others, whether his\r\nrelatives or not, come to him, and add credit and esteem to him, and\r\nmake him a leader. Thus there is no superior who gives him authority\r\nor title, beyond his own efforts and power. Consequently, might was\r\nproclaimed as right, and he who robbed most and tyrannized most was\r\nthe most powerful. If his children continued those tyrannies, they\r\nconserved that grandeur. If on the contrary, they were men of little\r\nability, who allowed themselves to be subjugated, or were reduced\r\neither by misfortunes and disastrous happenings, or by sicknesses\r\nand losses, they lost their grandeur with their possessions, as is\r\ncustomary throughout the world; and the fact that they had honored\r\nparents or relatives was of no avail to them, or is of no avail to them\r\nnow. In this way it has happened that the father might be a chief, and\r\nthe son or brother a slave--and worse, even a slave to his own brother.\r\n\r\n119. Their manner of life and ordinary conduct from the days of old\r\nis trade, in all sorts of things by wholesale, and more by retail\r\nin the products of the earth, in accordance with what is produced\r\nin each district. The maritime peoples are great fishers with net,\r\nline, and corral. The people who live inland are excellent farmers and\r\nhunters. They are always cultivating rice, besides other vegetables\r\nand garden products, quite different from those of Europa. The women\r\nalso are shrewd in trading, especially of their weaving, needlework,\r\nand embroideries, which they make very neatly; and there is scarcely\r\none who cannot read and write. Sometimes the husband and wife go\r\ntogether on their trading, and, whether for this or for any other\r\nthing, she must always go ahead; for it is not their custom to go\r\ntogether. Even if it be a band wholly made up of men or of women,\r\nor of men and women mixed, and even if the road be very wide, they\r\ngo in single file one after the other.\r\n\r\n120. The maritime peoples were accustomed to make many raids,\r\nand those of the interior to set ambushes for such depredations,\r\nwasting life in this. Their weapons consisted of bow and arrow;\r\na spear with a short handle, and a head shaped in innumerable ways,\r\nmost often with harpoon points; other spears without any head, with\r\nthe point made on the shaft itself (which is now of bamboo and now\r\nof wood), a vara long, hardened in fire. They had swords; large,\r\nsharp daggers, made very beautifully; and slender, long blowpipes\r\n[ceruatanas], through which they shot most dangerous poisoned arrows,\r\nin the manner of the inhabitants of Samatra. Such are their offensive\r\nweapons. Their defensive weapons are wooden shields and rattan or\r\ncorded breastplates, and other armor helmets of the same material.\r\n\r\n121. What justice, what fidelity, what honesty should there be amid\r\nso great cruelty and tyranny? Virginity and purity were ignominious,\r\nwhich is the general vice of idolaters. Whether married or single,\r\nthe woman who had no lover could not be safe; and by regarding that\r\nas an honor, they considered it a dishonor to give their persons\r\nfree. When men children were born in certain provinces, the mothers\r\nthemselves performed on them a certain form of circumcision, quite\r\ndifferent from that of the Jews and Moros, and only in order to render\r\nthem more skilful in their lewdness. Yet with all this, they abhorred,\r\nand chastised, and rigorously punished incest.\r\n\r\n122. In the celebration of their marriages, espousals, and divorces,\r\nand in the giving and receiving of dowries, they also proceeded\r\naccording to reason. In the first place, they agreed as to the dowry,\r\nwhich is promised and given even now by the man, in the sum named by\r\nthe parents. When it is determined the betrothal takes place, generally\r\nwith a conventional penalty which is rigorously executed. However,\r\nneither men nor women take it for an insult or grieve greatly if\r\nthe betrothal be refused, because then they benefit by the fine. The\r\ntruth is, that if those who are bound by the fine were the parents,\r\nafter their deaths the children are free to break the contract without\r\nincurring the penalty, by only the restitution of the amount received\r\nas dowry.\r\n\r\nMatrimony at present includes, besides the above, the delivery of\r\nthe person and the dowry. The latter is not received by the woman but\r\nby her parents or relatives, as it were selling their girls, in the\r\nmanner of the Mesopotamians and other nations. The parents convert\r\nthe dowry into their own estate, and it is distributed with the other\r\nproperty, at their deaths, among all the children equally. But if\r\nthe son-in-law has been very obedient to his parents-in-law; then\r\nthe latter generally return the dowry to their children. The other\r\nrelatives are only depositaries of what they must again deliver to the\r\nchildren. Besides the dowry, the chiefs formerly gave some presents\r\nto the parents and relatives, and even to the slaves, to a greater\r\nor less amount according to the rank of the bridegroom.\r\n\r\nThe pagan ceremony and form of marriage had to be authorized by\r\na sacrifice; for after the marriage had been agreed upon and the\r\ndowry paid over, the catalona came, and a hog was brought to her. The\r\nceremonies were performed as in other sacrifices. The lovers having\r\nseated themselves in their bridal chamber, each in the lap of an old\r\nwoman who acted as godmother, the latter gave them to eat from one\r\nplate and to drink from one cup. The bridegroom said that he took\r\nthe woman to wife, and, accepting her, the catalona or babaylana\r\nimmediately gave them a thousand benedictions, saying to them: \"May\r\nyou be well mated. May you beget many children and grandchildren,\r\nall rich and brave,\" and other things of this sort. Thereupon the hog\r\nwas slain, and the lovers were married; and when the others became\r\ntired of dancing and singing, all became intoxicated and went to\r\nsleep. If the recently-married couple did not suit each other, another\r\nsacrifice was ordered, in which the bridegroom himself danced and slew\r\nthe victim--the while talking to his anito, and offering himself to\r\nit for the sake of peace and harmony with his wife. That having been\r\ndone, he calmed himself, confident that then and thenceforth the two\r\nwould live in harmony, and enjoy their married life in peace.\r\n\r\nThese nations consider it important to take a wife only from their\r\nown family, and the nearer the better. Only they except the first\r\ngrade [of kinship], for they always considered that as a dissolving\r\nimpediment. But what marriages were those in which the contract was\r\nnot indissoluble, and could be dissolved by the woman, if she were to\r\nblame, merely returning the dowry! If the husband were to blame, it\r\nwas not returned; and the marriage could be repudiated by themselves,\r\nwithout any solemnity of law. That was done daily for very slight\r\ncauses, and new marriages were formed with others. Polygamy was not\r\nthe fashion among the Tagálogs. However, if the wife bore no children,\r\nthe husband could with his wife's permission have them by his slave\r\nwomen, in accordance with the example of the ancient patriarchs. Among\r\nthe principal Visayans, the ministers of the gospel found established\r\nthe custom of having two or more legitimate wives, and large dowries,\r\nwhich was a great obstacle to Christianity.\r\n\r\n123. Thus far in regard to marriage. As to the children and their\r\nsuccession and inheritance, if they were legitimate they inherited\r\nequally in the property of their parents. For lack of legitimate\r\nchildren the nearest relatives inherited. If there were illegitimate\r\nchildren, who had for example been had by a free woman, they had their\r\nshare in the inheritance, but not equally with the legitimate children,\r\nfor the latter received two-thirds, and the illegitimate one-third. But\r\nif there were no legitimate children then the illegitimate received\r\nall the inheritance. The children of a slave woman who belonged to\r\nthe man were given some part of the household effects, according to\r\nthe will of the legitimate children. In addition the mother became\r\nfree for the very reason that her master had had a child by her.\r\n\r\nThere were also adopted children, and the practice was that the one\r\nadopted bought his adoption. For the natural parent gave a certain sum\r\nto the adopted parent in order to have his son or daughter adopted,\r\nand thereupon the latter was adopted without any other subtlety\r\nof law or of paternal power. It was done only to the end that the\r\nadopted child, if he should outlive the one adopting him, should\r\ninherit double the sum that had been given for his adoption. Thus,\r\nif ten were given, he must inherit twenty. But if the adopted parent\r\noutlived the adopted child, the adoption expired as well as the right\r\nof inheritance, which was not given to the heirs of the adopted one,\r\neither in whole or in part. But if, on the contrary, the parent died\r\nwhile his own child was living, he left him by way of addition to the\r\nsum for adoption doubled, some jewel or slave woman, as a reward for\r\nhis good services. But, on the other hand, if the child was ungrateful\r\nand acted badly, the adoptive parent gave him up, by restoring the\r\nsum that had been given for his adoption.\r\n\r\nAdultery was not punished corporally, but by a pecuniary\r\nfine. Therefore the adulterer, by paying to the aggrieved party\r\nthe sum of gold agreed upon between them, or given by the sentence\r\nand judgment of the old men, was pardoned for the injury that he\r\nhad committed; and the aggrieved party was satisfied, and his honor\r\nwas not besmirched. Also he continued to live with his wife without\r\nanything more being said on the subject. But those children had by\r\na married woman did not succeed to the nobility of the parents or\r\nto their privileges; but were always reckoned plebeians, whom those\r\npeople call timauas. Likewise those children had by a slave woman,\r\nalthough they were free, as was the mother, were always regarded as\r\nof low birth. These who succeeded to the nobility were the legitimate\r\nchildren. In the barangay, when the father was lord of it his eldest\r\nson inherited that office; but, if he died, then he who came next in\r\norder. If there were no male children, then the daughters succeeded\r\nin the same order; and for want of either males or females, the\r\nsuccession went to the nearest relative of the last possessor. Thus\r\nno will was necessary for all those successions; for wills were never\r\nin vogue among these nations in the form and solemnity of such. As\r\nfor legacies it was sufficient to leave them openly, in writing or\r\nentrusted by word of mouth, in the presence of known persons.\r\n\r\n125. A great part of the wealth of these Indians consisted in\r\nslaves. For, after gold, no property was held in greater esteem,\r\nbecause of the many comforts that were enjoyed for their mode of\r\nliving through a multitude of slaves. Thus our Spaniards when they\r\nentered the islands found so many slaves that there were chiefs\r\nwho had one, two, and three hundred slaves, and those generally of\r\ntheir own color and nation, and not of other foreign nations. The\r\nmost general origin of those slaveries were interest and usury. That\r\nwas so much practiced among them, that no father would aid his son,\r\nno son his father, no brother his brother, and much less any relative\r\nhis relative, even though he were suffering extreme necessity, without\r\nan agreement to restore double. If payment was not made when promised,\r\nthe debtor remained a slave until he paid. That happened often, for\r\nthe interest or increase continued to accumulate just so long as the\r\npayment was deferred. Consequently, the interest exceeded the wealth\r\nof the debtor, and therefore the debt was loaded upon his shoulders,\r\nand the poor creature became a slave; and from that time his children\r\nand descendants were slaves. Other slaveries were due to tyranny\r\nand cruelty. For slaves were made either in vengeance on enemies, in\r\nthe engagements and petty wars that they waged against one another,\r\nin which the prisoners made remained slaves, even though they were of\r\nthe same village and race; or as a punishment which the more powerful\r\ninflicted on the weaker ones, even for a matter of little importance,\r\nof which they made a matter of insult. For instance if the lesser did\r\nnot observe the interdict on talking and noise, usual in the time of\r\nthe burial of the chiefs; if he passed near where the chief's wife was\r\nbathing; or if any dust or any other dirt fell from the house of the\r\ntimaua upon the chief or his wife when passing through the street:\r\nthen in these and numberless other similar cases the powerful ones\r\ndeprived the poor wretches of liberty, and tyrannically made them\r\nslaves--and not only them but their children, and perhaps the wife and\r\nnear relatives. The worst thing is that all those who had been made\r\nslaves by war, or for punishment of debts, were rigorously regarded\r\nas such, as slaves for any kind of service or slavery, and served\r\ninside the house. The same was true of their children, in the manner\r\nof our slaveries, and they could be sold at will. However, the masters\r\nwere not accustomed to sell those born under their roof, for they\r\nregarded them in the light of relatives. Those slaves were allowed\r\nto keep for themselves a portion of any profit which they made. The\r\nTagálogs called such true slaves sanguiguilir, and the Visayans halon.\r\n\r\nOther slaves were called namamahay, for they did not serve their\r\nmaster in all capacities, nor inside his house; but in their own\r\nhouses, and outside that of their masters. They were bound, however,\r\nto obey their master's summons either to serve in his house when he\r\nhad honored guests, or for the erection of his house and its repair,\r\nand in the seasons of sowing and harvest. They [had also to respond]\r\nto act as his rowers when he went out in his boat, and on other like\r\noccasions, in which they were obliged to serve their master without\r\nany pay.\r\n\r\n126. Among both kinds of slaves, sanguiguilir and namamahay, it happens\r\nthat there are some who are whole slaves, some who are half slaves,\r\nand some one-fourth part slave. For if the father or the mother were\r\nfree, and had an only son he was half free and half slave. If they had\r\nmore than one child, these were so divided that the first followed\r\nthe condition of the father, whether free or slave, and the second\r\nthat of the mother. So did it happen with successive pairs. But if\r\nthere were an odd number of children, the last was half free and half\r\nslave. Those who descended from them, if they were children of a free\r\nfather or mother, were slaves only in the fourth part, as they were the\r\nchildren of a free father or mother, and of one half slave. Sometimes,\r\nbecause it happened that two people had agreed to marry and the man\r\nhad no wealth for the dowry--or rather, nothing with which to buy his\r\nwife--he became her slave. In such case the children were divided in\r\nthe said manner, and the first, third, and fifth, and the remaining\r\nones in the same way were slaves, inasmuch as they belonged to the\r\nfather, who was also a slave of the mother--and not only slaves to her,\r\nbut also to her brothers and sisters and relatives, in case of her\r\ndeath and the division of her property. On the contrary the second,\r\nfourth, and others in the same way, were according to their custom\r\nfree, inasmuch as they belonged to their mother who was free; and\r\nthey were masters and rulers over their own father and brothers and\r\nsisters. The same thing happened in the case of interest, a thing\r\nof so great importance among them that, as already remarked, the\r\nfather would not pardon the debt and interest even to the son, nor\r\nthe son the father, even in case of necessity, until the one had made\r\na slave of the other for it. Consequently, if one brother ransomed\r\nanother brother, or a son his father, the latter remained a slave,\r\nas did his descendants, until the value of the ransom was paid with\r\ninterest. Consequently, the captive was gainer only by the change of\r\nmaster. Such as the above are the monstrous things that are seen where\r\nthe law of God and Christian charity are lacking. In the division made\r\nbetween heirs, when a slave belonged to many, the time of his service\r\nwas divided and each of the masters had the share that belonged to him\r\nand was his in such slave; and the division was made by months, or as\r\nwas convenient among the masters. When a slave is not a whole slave\r\nbut only a half or fourth part, he has the right to compel his master\r\nto give him his freedom for the just price at which he is appraised,\r\naccording to the rank of the slavery, sanguiguilir or namamahay. But\r\nif he be a whole slave, the master cannot be compelled to ransom him\r\nat any price, even though he should have become a slave for debt,\r\nif already the day set for the payment of the debt has passed.\r\n\r\n127. There was another kind of service which was not of a truth\r\nservitude, although it appeared to be such. It was generally seen among\r\ncertain persons called cabalangay. Whenever such persons wanted any\r\nsmall trifle, they begged the head chief of their barangay for it,\r\nand he gave it to them. In return, whenever he summoned them they\r\nwere obliged to go to him to work in his fields or to row in his\r\nboats. Whenever a feast or banquet was given, then they all came\r\ntogether and helped furnish the tuba, wine, or quilan, such being\r\ntheir method of service.\r\n\r\n128. The ancient custom in manumission was for the whole sanguiguilir\r\nslave to pay ten taes of gold, and the namamahay the half; and,\r\nin addition to that, he had to give the half of whatever things\r\nhe owned. For instance, if he owned two large jars he had to give\r\none. In order to make that conveyance, the slave must make a banquet,\r\nat which were present masters, relatives, and friends. At the height of\r\nthe banquet the delivery of the gold and household articles was made,\r\nthose present being witnesses that the master had received them. The\r\nlatter was thereupon satisfied, and the slave was set free.\r\n\r\nEven today the Tagálogs are wont, at death, to grant freedom to the\r\nchildren of their slaves who are born in their house, no matter how\r\nyoung they be. However, they do not free the parents of those children\r\nno matter how old they be, and even if they have been served throughout\r\nlife by them. That seems absolutely illogical.\r\n\r\n129. To what has been said of dowries and marriages, it must be added\r\nthat in some districts, besides the bigaycaya and those presents made\r\nto the relatives, there was panhimuyat. This was a kind of present\r\nthat was given to the mother of the bride, merely in return for the\r\nbad and watchful nights that she had passed in rearing her. That\r\npanhimuyat signifies \"watchfulness and care.\" If the dowry was equal\r\nto five taes of gold, the panhimuyat was equal to one tinga, which was\r\nequivalent to one tae, or five pesos. That was a custom which well\r\nshows the harshness and greed of these nations, since the mothers\r\nwished to be paid even for the rearing of their daughters.\r\n\r\nAlso, whenever a chief married any daughter of his and asked a large\r\ndowry of his son-in-law, as, for instance, eighteen or twenty taes of\r\ngold, the father was obliged to give his daughter certain gifts called\r\npasonor, such as a gold chain, or a couple of slaves, or something\r\nproportional to the dowry. It was very shameful to ask a large dowry\r\nwithout giving a pasonor. This is still done, resembling the gifts\r\nwhich among us the father presents to his daughter præter dotem,\r\n[27] which the civil law calls bona paraphernalia. [28]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVES OF THE SOUTHERN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Francisco Combés, S.J., [29] in his Historia de las islas de Mindanao,\r\nIolo, y sus adjacentes (Madrid, 1667), devotes a number of pages to\r\nthe peoples of Mindanao and other islands. This matter we translate\r\nfrom the reprint issued (Madrid, 1887) by Pablo Pastells, S.J.,\r\nand W. E. Retana, book i, chapters ix-xviii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n    Of the nations of these islands and those adjacent to them\r\n\r\n\r\nFour nations have renown in this island, the Caragas, [30] Mindanaos,\r\n[31] Lutaos, [32] and Subanos. [33] That of most renown is the nation\r\nof Caraga, which, although it is the smallest numerically, has been\r\nthe greatest in deeds. In times past that nation was the scourge of\r\nthe islands, as is today proclaimed by the depredations that still\r\nare fresh in memory in the islands of Pintados--especially so in that\r\nof Leyte, where there is scarce a village which has not bewailed its\r\nruin. A good part of this ruin extended to Ours, the pirates having\r\npillaged our town of Palo and destroyed all the villages of the coast,\r\ntaking prisoner the father ransomer, [34] who exercised that office\r\nfor all the jurisdiction, and obliging those who lived in the villages\r\nto retire into the mountains. Those nations maintained themselves by\r\ntheir own valor, without protection of the pagan kings; they were\r\nbold against all, and no one dared to do anything to them. They\r\nare a brave nation on sea and land, and on land they are the first\r\nnation of the islands; and by their aid great exploits have been\r\naccomplished, as was seen in the conquest of the lake of Malanao,\r\nand in all others that have occurred since they were subdued by the\r\ngospel and the Catholic arms.\r\n\r\nThe second nation in estimation is the Mindanao, which includes the\r\nkingdoms of Buhayen; for in olden times they were all one nation,\r\nand today, although various petty rulers govern them, they are one in\r\ncustoms and language. They are a nation of some valor, and with their\r\npolicy of being subject to kings they have acquired esteem among the\r\nother nations, whom they have united under one political government\r\nfor achievements that are too great for their own courage. They are\r\ntreacherous and of little faith, as they are now swayed by the impious\r\nworship of Mahomet.\r\n\r\nThe third nation is the Lutaya. It is a nation common to these islands\r\nof Mindanao, Jolo, and Basilan. In all these islands it preserves\r\nthe name of Lutao, for since that is their vocation it well explains\r\ntheir nature. For Lutao means, in those languages, \"he who swims and\r\ngoes floating over the water.\" Such is the nature of these people that\r\nthey know no other house than the ship. In the villages which they have\r\nformed they well show the inclination with which they were born; for\r\nthey are so fond of living on the sea that their houses are built in\r\nit, in places which the low tide leaves exposed. In that way they can\r\nset upright the trunks of the trees with which they must form their\r\nhouses, driving them down according to the load which they have to\r\nsustain. When it is high tide the houses are very far from the shore,\r\nand the water in between is so deep that brigs and craft of heavier\r\ntonnage can sail there. These people hate the land so thoroughly\r\nthat they do not trouble themselves at all about its cultivation,\r\nnor get any benefit from it. All their labor lies in fishing, and\r\nthey get from that the means of barter for whatever they need, even\r\nfor the wood that they burn and the logs from which they build their\r\nhouses and craft. Since they are so slightly attached to the land,\r\nthey easily move to other parts, and know no fixed abode except the\r\nsea; for although they recognize villages, in which they assemble,\r\nthey seldom live in these, for they are scattered through the bays\r\nand beaches suitable for their fishing. They live under the kings of\r\nMindanao and Jolo, and the chiefs of the same, and those of the island\r\nof Basilan; today with some, tomorrow with others, according to the\r\ndistrict in which they are. Those of this island are scattered along\r\nall the coast which extends from Samboangan to the river of Mindanao,\r\nand have no fixed dwelling in any other part--except some of them who\r\nhave settled in the city of Cebú and a few others in the village of\r\nDapitan. They are equally esteemed in all parts as being the sinews\r\nfor the wars of these regions (their campaign field being the sea),\r\nand also for their skill in constructing vessels fit for the wars of\r\nthese regions, and their skill in managing them.\r\n\r\nBy their constant communication with,all the nations (as they go\r\nto all parts for their advantage), and because of their method of\r\nliving--which is so in the manner of traders, enjoying the fruits of\r\nthe land--and by the alertness of their intelligence, they are the\r\nmost capable, the most clear-sighted, and the most crafty people of\r\nthese islands. Therefore, they maintain the supremacy in everything,\r\nand, although they are the smallest in number, and everywhere the\r\nmost foreign [of all these peoples], they are today the kings, and\r\nhold the rulers as their slaves; for now by loans, now by violence,\r\nand now by private vengeance, they have established the entire slavery\r\nof these islands.\r\n\r\nAs their work causes but little exertion, naturally they grow up lazy,\r\nand only shake off their laziness for the gains and advantages of an\r\nindustry like trading and sea piracy. And since the gains derived from\r\nthat source are sure, both because the cunning employed by them is\r\nthat of finished robbers, and because their wings are those of royal\r\nfalcons, they are most eager for that exercise, as they are assured\r\nby these advantages from all danger; for, whether it be because of\r\nthe swiftness of their ships or because of their skill in rowing\r\nthem, no ship of ours has ever been able to overtake them. Assured\r\non that point, they have pillaged whatever their greed has dictated\r\nto them. Their method of attack is for all of them to land at once\r\nwith a terrifying and barbaric cry, the awfulness of which strikes\r\nterror to the people as they are caught defenseless and separated\r\nand thus incapable of resistance.\r\n\r\nThey are more circumspect on the sea, when danger does not oblige\r\nthem to make resistance. For since these natives do not fight for\r\nreputation, but only for gain, they seek to assure that, and not to\r\nbuy it too dear with their blood. Therefore, when they meet a ship\r\nwhich they think cannot make any resistance they go to it in certainty\r\nof making it a prize, and that they will catch it a half-legua from\r\nshore. However small it be, they do not care to seize it if there\r\nis any danger. They continue to row about it, until they cause it to\r\nwaste its powder in spectacular warfare, and then, when they see it\r\nweakening, they attack it with great valor throwing by hand so many\r\nmissile weapons that no man can [safely] show his face; and when they\r\nget within range there is rarely a man who is not wounded, for they\r\nhurl these missiles in showers. No matter how well equipped a boat\r\nmay be, if once it gets within their range it has to surrender;\r\nfor then their men, both sailors and soldiers hurl their arrows\r\nwith both hands, so that they confuse those who uncover themselves\r\nfor the fight. But by startling them from a distance, that danger\r\nis not imminent, and less resistance suffices. In order that this\r\nmay be better understood, I shall relate some attested incidents of\r\nsuch encounters. One happened to an inhabitant of Dapitan, with whom\r\nI sailed for many days. He, when going toward his village in a small\r\nboat, met the fleet of the Joloans. A ship with one piece immediately\r\nleft the fleet to pursue him. The Indian carried a musket, and after\r\nhe had discharged it the enemy, recognizing it, moderated their zeal,\r\nand coming within range discharged their own piece. Then they backed\r\nwater in order to load again and repeated the attack, always keeping a\r\nclose watch on the musket. In this way they made three attacks, until\r\nat the third their piece became enraged, and breaking its carriage,\r\nfell into the sea. Thereupon the enemy dared attempt nothing more,\r\nand retired. The same fortune happened to Father Antonio Abarca, [35]\r\nof our Society, of whom we shall make honorable mention later. He,\r\nhaving left me in Dapitan in order to go over to Bohol, on that same\r\nday while sailing toward that island, and while still one legua away\r\nfrom it, found three hostile joangas of Joloans at another island,\r\nsmall and uninhabited, called Illaticasa, which attacked him at the\r\nsame time. There was but one firearm in the ship, and the father\r\nwas the only one who knew how to manage it. He seeing himself so far\r\nfrom land, and pursued by an enemy so keen and so swift on the sea,\r\navailed himself of his courage, which was great, and of his skill,\r\nwhich was remarkable; and, adroitly fighting, he kept firing at the\r\nenemy, until he gained shore, being almost all the time in range of\r\nthem, and so near that they talked to one another. By that means he\r\nsaved himself and his people--a thing that would have been impossible\r\nin any other manner; but his defense was so fiery that in less than\r\nhalf an hour he fired the gun more than thirty times.\r\n\r\nThese people are the instruments of all the exploits by sea, for of\r\nall the other nations no one will embark unless he is forced; and\r\non account of the little effectiveness that is found by experience\r\nin all the others, our enemies, who are watchful for their own\r\nsafety and for fortunate results, are not hindered by those other\r\npeoples. Consequently, he who has most men from this nation is\r\nconsidered the most powerful and is the most feared, as they have\r\npower to infest the seas and coasts, making captives and pillaging,\r\nand making themselves masters of the crossings and passages necessary\r\nfor communication with the other islands.\r\n\r\nFor that same reason the Mindanao has become so feared in these\r\nlatter years that although he of Buhayen is the true and legitimate\r\nking, he is coming to be less esteemed; for since the Mindanao king\r\nhas many Lutaos, he has also power to make war. And although the\r\nking of Buhayen has twenty-fold more vassals, he can make no one\r\nuneasy because he has no subjects of this nation; consequently,\r\nhe has no weight in these islands. For the wars of these nations,\r\nnow because of their little permanence, now because of the natural\r\nruggedness of their settled parts, are but seldom offensive by land;\r\nfor the enemy are immediately perceived, and the less powerful avail\r\nthemselves of the shelter of the mountains. Since the people are of\r\nlittle endurance and less subordination they cannot sustain long\r\ncampaigns. Therefore, at most the valiant ones set an ambush, and\r\naccording to the way it falls out the campaign is finished without\r\nthe spoils being surrendered; for their articles of value, as there\r\nis so little good faith among them, are always kept buried, or are\r\nso light that they are carried along with them. On that account he\r\nalone is judged powerful who has people to make war by sea. In ancient\r\ntimes this power caused all this island to pay tribute to the king of\r\nMindanao in order to be free from his attacks. In the time of Buisan,\r\nthe father of Corralat, they had hopes of rendering all the islands\r\nof Pintados tributary; and, though the island of Burney is so out of\r\nthe way, more than twenty thousand vassals pay tribute to him in the\r\nvillages called Suaco. For the same reason, although the Joloan nation\r\nis so small, it has become the most distinguished in these islands;\r\nfor on sea it equals the strength of the Mindanaos, as they have as\r\nmany or more vassals of the Lutao nation.\r\n\r\nThe fourth nation is the Subano. They are the settlers along the\r\nrivers. To them is due the name suba, which is the equivalent of\r\n\"river\" in the general language of these nations. It is the nation of\r\nleast esteem, both because of their natural barbarousness, for they\r\nlive in the plains with as little association with one another as\r\nhave brutes (one house being located a legua's distance from another,\r\naccording to where each one wishes to build his hut); and because of\r\ntheir poverty, which is dire. For since they have no other intelligence\r\nthan [what is required for] their work, their slothfulness reduces\r\ntheir efforts to what necessity [only] requires, so that what is\r\nabundant for a laborious life is always lacking with them. They are\r\ndeficient in civilized ways, along with human intercourse, as they\r\nare born so hostile and so averse to communication [with others] that\r\nthey grow old in their rude settlements without curiosity drawing\r\nthem from their place of residence, or without their seeing the sea,\r\nalthough some of them live where they hear news of the horror of its\r\ntumults and movements. If either necessity or gain has made them give\r\na glance at their rivers, they are satisfied with that, and do not\r\nseek a better fortune with its dangers. This inertia forbids them,\r\nincapable of giving force to their ambition, from following its\r\nimpulses with [favoring] winds.\r\n\r\nThey are as cowardly as treacherous, the one being the consequence of\r\nthe other. He who better plans a bit of treachery and comes out most\r\nsafely is considered the most valiant. As they all know one another,\r\nthey look out for one another, and build their houses so high up\r\nthat a pike cannot reach and wound them. Their usual practice is\r\nto seek a very high tree, where they can build their nests safely;\r\nand, their houses being so unostentatious in size and furnishing,\r\na tree holds them easily. The ladder by which they ascend is a log,\r\nsome grooves that they cut in it serving as steps. On the coming of\r\nnight they draw this ladder up and thus sleep secure. They teach us\r\nthe little with which life is satisfied, and the fatigues which our\r\nambition and pride give us; for in order to satisfy our ambition\r\nand pride we take upon us so many cares, which, so far as life is\r\nconcerned, are superfluous, and are not the least of the accidents\r\nwhich our life suffers. This nation is almost wholly in vassalage to\r\nthe Lutaos, and every village recognizes some chief [36] of the latter\r\nnation to whom they pay tribute; and that chief bears himself as a\r\nking among them, and makes and unmakes at his will. In the beginning,\r\nthis authority entered under color of protection and support against\r\nthe king of Mindanao, and remained in enthroned tyranny, so that today\r\nmost of this nation are slaves of the Lutaos--their want of intellect\r\nsubjecting them to a thousand cheats, and their want of protection\r\nto a thousand outrages. For since the Lutaos are so alert a nation,\r\nand so sharp in their affairs, they have gradually bought the Subanos\r\nby trading with them, becoming masters of their entire freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    Of the noble and brave nation of the Dapitans\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this island, which has given empires to so many kings, without doubt\r\nthe crown is the village of Dapitan; and, although it is so small at\r\npresent, it has been one of the most densely populated in the past,\r\nthe one most respected for its power, and in our times the whole,\r\nboth of these conquests and of their Christian churches. In a small\r\nnumber, reduced to one single village, there is inclosed a nation\r\n[37] apart from all the others, and superior to all those discovered\r\nin nobility, valor, fidelity, and Catholicism. They are descended\r\nfrom the island of Bool, where they anciently occupied the strait\r\nmade by that island and the island of Panglao, which remains dry at\r\nlow tide, but at high tide allows a galliot to pass. Therefore many\r\nbrazas in the sea stand, even today, certain columns of upright wood,\r\nas honorable witnesses of the location so gloriously occupied by\r\nthis nation, and today the venerable ruins of poor although adequate\r\nbuildings which they sustained. They occupied both shores and the\r\nentire island of Panglao. There they conquered the famous people\r\nof Bohol; for as their nation was the less numerous in that island,\r\nthey were obliged to sustain their name by their deeds. The Boholans,\r\nconquered and put to flight, abandoned the site which they occupied\r\nfrom the shore of the strait to the coast of Baclayon and took refuge\r\non the river of Loboc, where their name is still preserved in a few\r\nfamilies descended from that stock which conquered that island, and\r\nonly the valor of the Dapitans subdued. [38] According to the ancient\r\nlaw of the land the Dapitans can call the Boholans their slaves since\r\nless title was sufficient for that in the days of their antiquity,\r\nand the most authoritative reason was always that of war.\r\n\r\nWar exiled the Dapitans from their country, a proof of their valor\r\nand the unforeseen accidents of their misfortunes; for they were the\r\nonly people of all the archipelago who were renowned among foreign\r\nprinces for their exploits, and to them alone were embassies made. It\r\nhappened then that in an embassy sent by the king of Terrenate,\r\nthe most warlike and powerful king known, his ambassador lost [due]\r\nrespect for the house of the Dapitan princes--then represented by\r\nDailisan and Pagbuaya, who were brothers--by making advances to\r\na concubine. They punished the crime more by the laws of offended\r\nand irritated fury than by those of reason, with hideous and indeed\r\ncruel demonstrations of contempt, by cutting off the noses and ears\r\nof the ambassador and his men. When they had returned to Terrenate,\r\nthe horrid aspect of his subjects aroused the wrath of the king. He\r\narmed all his power in twenty joangas to oppose the Dapitans. His\r\ngeneral, doubtful of the outcome, as he knew the valor of those\r\nwith whom he had to do, made use of a trick by which he assured a\r\ndeceitful victory. He sent his joangas in, one by one, giving out that\r\nthey were traders, and under the security of friendship--excusing the\r\nabove occurrence, in order to divert the attention [of the Dapitans],\r\nwith the laws of punishment, deserved because of the boldness of their\r\nmen. The Dapitans, seeing that the Ternatans were attending only to\r\nthe sale of their goods, lost their caution, and came up with the same\r\nconfidence as ever. When the Ternatans had all their fleet together,\r\nand saw that of the Dapitans, they closed with them. Although the\r\nlatter placed themselves in a position of defense, they retreated\r\nbefore that multitude, and the terror of arms to which they were\r\nunaccustomed; for the Ternatans already had muskets and arquebuses,\r\nthe use of which they had before other nations, because of their\r\ntrade with the Portuguese. [39] The frightful effects of these,\r\nas terrible by their ruin as by their novelty, worked on the minds\r\nof the Dapitans. Dailisan was killed in that fray, and his brother\r\nPagbuaya was left the reigning prince. He, seeing how he was involved\r\nwith the Ternatans, and how much at the mercy of their new [arms]\r\n[40] was the place occupied by the Dapitans--where the Ternatan\r\nships could succeed in anchoring under the houses of the Dapitans,\r\nand using their arms, fight them in safety--resolved to seek another\r\nplace, better defended. He also thus resolved because these nations\r\nregard as unlucky the place where fortune has once shown itself\r\nhostile to them, and immediately abandon it as accursed. Even today,\r\nin these islands, it is a fact that the house where a chief dies is\r\nabandoned by his people and it remains alone, waiting its ruin. [41]\r\nHe sought then a place where, their valor and its ruggedness joining\r\nhands, they could make up, aided by the strength of the site, for\r\nthe small number of their nation. As there were no hills on their\r\ncoasts, and they were unable to restrain their noble and warlike\r\nnature to the confinement and gloomy prison of the retired mountains,\r\nwhere they would be deprived of the trade and benefits of the sea,\r\nthey crossed to the island of Mindanao, a crossing of fifteen leguas,\r\nand twenty from their village, and seized a small rugged hill, which\r\nwould allow itself to be monopolized by their valor.\r\n\r\nThe people who elected to follow Pagbuaya numbered one thousand\r\nfamilies of freemen, his subjects, without taking into account the\r\nunmarried men. In these nations, where there is a law of dowry--or\r\nrather a law for the purchase of wives--there are many men who are\r\ndenied the bonds of matrimony because of their poverty. Neither do\r\nwe reckon the slaves of the prince, who exceeded five hundred, and\r\nmany other families of the Lutao nation, who as they now live under\r\nthe protection of the kings of Mindanao and Jolo, lived then also\r\nunder the protection of the Dapitan princes.\r\n\r\nThey had occupied the new site but a short time when their renown\r\ncaused anxiety to the most remote princes, who were fearful of\r\ntheir power. Consequently, the king of the great island of Burney\r\nwas the first to send his ambassador with two joangas, soliciting\r\ntheir friendship. While they were yet awaiting the resolution of the\r\nDapitans, the brave Magallanes sighted their coasts with his squadron,\r\nas we shall relate in the second book. They immediately made peace\r\nwith him, being pleased, as brave men, with the valor which they\r\nrecognized in the unknown people. [42] The Borneans were sent away\r\nwith the message that the Dapitans wished no other friendship than\r\nthat of their new guests. They have preserved that friendship to\r\nthis day, as noble people, without any complaint [arising] of their\r\nloyalty, even to the lowest slave; and their exploits in favor of\r\nour arms have deserved much praise. For the son of that Pagbuaya,\r\ncalled Manooc, following the fidelity of his father, and surpassing\r\nit with the good fortune of being a Christian, aided the Spaniards in\r\ntheir first conquests of these islands--especially in the conquest of\r\nManila, the capital of all these islands; and later in the conquest\r\nof Camarines, taking at their own expense, in all these feats of arms,\r\ntheir men and the nations subject to them.\r\n\r\nThat prince, who, as he was the first to become acquainted with\r\nthe Spaniards (having shared the knowledge of them which his father\r\nacquired with the first sight of the squadron of Magallanes), was the\r\nfirst to receive the blessing of acquaintance with our holy faith,\r\ngiving renown equally to his own banners and to those of our king and\r\nsovereign, and receiving the name Don Pedro Manuel Manooc--continued\r\nthe greatness of his deeds. For besides the services rendered in\r\nManila and the province of Camarines, he sustained war against\r\nMindanao and Jolo, and attacked them with his fleets in their very\r\nhouses. On one occasion, when among others he went to attack Jolo,\r\nhe met the king himself, who was also going out with his fleet\r\nof twelve joangas. Manooc defeated him and captured his flagship,\r\nand, at the cost of many killed, the king escaped as a fugitive, by\r\nhastening to the land. He made war on the Caragas, who were the terror\r\nof the islands at that time. He subdued the village of Bayug of the\r\nMalanao [43] nation, who were subject to the Mindanaos, without our\r\narms having any other protection amid so many enemies than that of his\r\nvalor which made easy so many undertakings. That prince was the father\r\nof Doña Maria Uray, who is today living as an example and ornament\r\nof these nations because of the perfection of her virtues--which she\r\nprefers to a better fortune, for she has spurned marriage with the\r\nkings of Jolo in order that she might not subject her faith to the\r\noutrages of barbarous and faithless princes. Don Pedro Manuel Manooc\r\nleft orders that he was to be buried in the city of Cebú, as he had\r\nordered in his will that his bones be taken to that cathedral. His\r\nchildren carried out his orders, thereby showing both their affection\r\nto us and their devotion to him.\r\n\r\nThe women were not inferior in merit. For Doña Madalena Baloyog, the\r\nsister of Don Pedro Manuel Manooc, had so great authority among the\r\nbarbarous Subanos that she alone by her discretion reduced more of\r\nthem than did the arms of her people by their valor and courage. She\r\nobtained the name of pacifier, mistress, and sovereign of the hard\r\nhearts of the chiefs of the Subanos. Her authority was so manifest\r\nto our men that, the natives of the river of Butuan having rebelled,\r\nand killed their alcalde-mayor and their minister, a secular priest,\r\nwho was then in charge of it, [44] it was sufficient for her to assure\r\nthem of pardon for the deed, and to secure to us their pacification\r\nand due obedience forever.\r\n\r\nThe cousin of Don Pedro Manuel Manooc was Laria, who competed in all\r\nthings for the greatness of his cousin. He served in the conquest of\r\nMaluco with the same nobility and valor, and would receive no pay or\r\nrations for his men. In the seven times when the island of Jolo was\r\nattacked in war, he took part in all of those conflicts, always showing\r\nhimself remarkable for his princely actions and soldierly valor.\r\n\r\nA son worthy the nobility of such a father was Don Gonçalo Maglenti,\r\nthe husband of Doña Maria Uray, whom we mentioned above, and the\r\nfather of Don Pedro Cabelin. The latter is still living and is\r\nnowise inferior in his deeds and fidelity to his forbears, as he was\r\nreared from childhood with so good merits of nobility and Christian\r\nwarfare--accompanying his father from the age of seven years, on all\r\noccasions of danger; thus he came to despise danger so thoroughly\r\nthat at the age of thirty (his present age) the enemies of God and\r\nof our king whom he has killed in hand-to-hand combats, in various\r\nfrays, surpass two hundred. Don Gonçalo, then, the father of so\r\nillustrious a son, left him enough examples to emulate his valor,\r\nfor in accordance with his surname (which means \"he who hurls down\r\nthunderbolts\"), his valor hurled them in a constant shower. He opposed\r\nthe might of the Mindanaos at the time of their greatest arrogance,\r\nwhen they threatened all these islands with their arms. He always went\r\nin pursuit of their fleets and of those of the Malanaos which were\r\nsent by way of the bay of Pangil [45] to aid the Mindanaos, for he\r\nwas an ally for the defeat of their plans. He subdued from the bay of\r\nPangil to the village of Sidabay, ten leguas from Samboangan, all of\r\nthe villages scattered through sixty leguas along the coast (formerly\r\nmany more and superior in number). His care watched perpetually over\r\nthe islands, and of his own accord he despatched advices to Cebú and\r\nOton at the first rumor of hostile fleets, by means of which the evil\r\ndesigns of the enemies might be frustrated. That care merited for\r\nhis nation exemption from the tribute and from all personal service,\r\nwhich its natives enjoy today by concession from his Majesty.\r\n\r\nIn this site the Dapitans--now reduced to the enterprises of his\r\nvalor to so small a number that they scarce exceed one hundred\r\nfamilies--alone and strangers, have defended themselves from the\r\npower of all the pirates of these islands, all of whom, pursuing them\r\nwith their vengeance and injuries, have attempted to extirpate them\r\nentirely. And as they have the land so at their mercy, with nations\r\nwho have inherited so much internal hatred [to the Dapitans] at being\r\nsubdued by this noble nation, the former have been unable to get one\r\nsingle captive out of their hands, and their sieges are always left\r\ncrowned with triumphs. For Buhisán, the father of Corralat, and the\r\nmost warlike of the kings of Mindanao, with one hundred joangas and\r\nthe incentive of his own person and presence, returned within fifteen\r\nmonths, his haughtiness undeceived. The Joloans, notwithstanding\r\ntheir power, had no better fortune, and left behind seven joangas in\r\nthe enterprise that they attempted--although the opportunity was so\r\nin their favor, when there were scarcely ten men in the stronghold,\r\nas the majority had gone to various places for their trade.\r\n\r\nAmong the Subanos--the ports of their conquest, which surround\r\nthem on all sides--their valor is so accredited, that a Dapitan has\r\nnothing to fear among a hundred of them. For if they see him ready\r\nfor them, they do not dare to attack him, however thirsty for his\r\nblood their hatred makes them; for the Subanos are all the triumphs of\r\nthe arms of the Dapitans, of which the sound and rigorous execution\r\nhas drawn the former from their mountains, and made settlements of\r\nmen from savages scattered among the thickets, who are reduced to\r\nmore civilized life. Thus has been established a province which, in\r\nour time, has been given separate an alcalde-mayor, namely, that of\r\nIligan; and by that province is secured to our arms an opening for\r\nthe conquest of Mindanao and Jolo, as we have thereby had soldiers,\r\npilots, and most skilful sailors, who are better than all those who\r\nsail in these islands. Their village remains as a stronghold opposed\r\nto the petty rulers of those peoples.\r\n\r\nThey are a very prudent race, and are quite Hispanicized in their\r\ncustoms, and by the modesty of their bearing naturally deserved\r\nrespectable. Thus they do not endure the outrages that the other\r\nsubdued nations endure, now from the boldness of the soldiers,\r\nnow from the exigencies of our necessities; for they attend\r\nto all things willingly, considering it an honor to satisfy our\r\ndesires. Consequently, in respect and esteem they are the princes of\r\nthese islands.\r\n\r\nIn matters of the Christian faith they yield in no wise to the most\r\npious European nation or to the loyalty of the most distinguished. They\r\nare the ones who guard religion. The minister who visits the ports\r\nof their coast, with four Dapitans whom he takes as a guard goes as\r\nsafely as if he were taking an infantry regiment; and no misfortune\r\nhas ever happened to such an arrangement. For although misfortunes\r\nhave been experienced in the infidelity of the native Subanos, yet\r\nthey have been invited by the confidence of the father missionaries,\r\nwho have gone among them without that valiant guard, as will be seen\r\nin the course of this history. Finally, the faith of this island and\r\nthose near by is owing to the Dapitans; and, to their fidelity and\r\nvalor, the glorious confidence of our arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n    The settlers of these islands, and their origin\r\n\r\n\r\nThe owners of these islands are those who people the mountains. They,\r\nenamored with their peaceful mode of living, and fed with the happy\r\nreturns of their cultivation, built their nests there and lost\r\ntheir liking for the coast and love for its occupations. Thereupon,\r\nas they were reared in so deep retirement, which is especially great\r\nand unconquerable in these natives, because of their slothfulness and\r\nbecause they are so dead to curiosity, by which they have grown old\r\nin their gloomy retreats, they gradually became mountaineers; and,\r\ntheir intercourse with other peoples ceasing, they became less alert\r\nand more barbarous, allowing the foreign traders to seize the coasts,\r\nharbor-bars, and rivers which they found deserted. Since by their\r\ntrade, and in every way, the latter were making themselves masters\r\nof all things, the aborigines, being less valiant, yielded to the\r\nforeigners, as these were more civilized. Consequently, on the south\r\ncoast the rulers of those peoples are the Lutaos, who bear themselves\r\namong these nations as princes. In some parts those peoples are called\r\nSubanos, as in the jurisdiction of Iligan and Samboangan; in Mindanao,\r\nthey are called Manobos [46] and Mananapes [47] which is equivalent\r\nto \"brutes.\" In Jolo, they are Guinuanos [i.e., Guimbanos], and in\r\nBasilan they are called Sameacas, [48] and they are subject in all\r\nplaces equally to the fortune of the Lutaos. No other origin to these\r\npeoples can be conjectured than one general to these islands--whose\r\nlanguage, since its structure is founded on Malayan roots, shows by\r\nits origin the origin of its natives. To this testimony corresponds\r\nthe arrangement of these islands, which are strung out in a series\r\nfrom Burney and Macaçar, so that there is scarcely any considerable\r\nbreak, and there is no such correspondence in any other part.\r\n\r\nThe Lutaya nation are new in these islands, and live more on the seas\r\nthan on their plains. They have no greater stability than is promised\r\nby a log in the water where no firm foundation can be laid. They\r\nscarcely take their feet from their boats. Their Moorish dress of\r\nturban and marlota [i.e., a Moorish robe], their arms and worship,\r\nclearly show their origin. With all this agrees their more polished\r\nlanguage, which they speak, emulating the grandeur of the princes of\r\nthese nations who have made an ostentation of speaking it--indeed,\r\nbecause their own especial language approaches more nearly to it than\r\nany other, for they owe to it a great number of their words. [49] As\r\nthe Moorish faith [i.e., Mahometanism] is recent in India, [50] and\r\nthence has steadily spread through these kingdoms it can be understood\r\nthat this nation [i.e., the Lutaos] occupied these coasts but a short\r\ntime ago. The Lutaos of this island who are subject to Corralat and\r\nthe Buhayens (both through commerce and by the submission which they\r\nobserved toward the king of Ternate) show that they are branches\r\nof that stock. They recognize even their protection, which in olden\r\ntimes was the greatest obligation, and give them aid in their wars and\r\nprotect them from their enemies. By the prowess of the Lutaos those\r\nrulers were encouraged to cause grievous depredations among these\r\nislands, until the Spaniards established themselves so strongly in\r\nTernate that, checked by that, as a bulwark of the islands, the Moro\r\nchiefs did not attempt to pass farther, being content with placing\r\ntheir domestic affairs in safety without risking it for foreign\r\n[gains].\r\n\r\nThere are black negroes in this island, who pay tribute to no one. They\r\nresemble those of the island of Negros, and of the uplands about\r\nManila, called Aetas. They live more like brute beasts than like\r\nmen, and they flee from the sight of all, doing ill to whomever they\r\ncan. They recognize no village, nor in a land of so many inclemencies\r\ndo they have any other shelter than that of the trees. They can be\r\nseen daily in the bay of Pangil. In the village of Layauan, where I\r\nwas making the visitation, there appeared to be many of them. They\r\nhave no other adornments than those which they inherited from nature;\r\nand pay so scant respect to decency that they do not secure even what\r\nis requisite. Their arms are the bow and arrows dipped in poisons,\r\nwhich they know and with which they prepare the arrows. It appears\r\nprobable, from what we know of other islands, where these people are\r\nfound gathered in the most inaccessible mountains, that these are the\r\nfirst ones that occupied all these islands; but, as they are more\r\nancient and are so shut in, nothing more is known of their origin\r\nthan what is evident from this land, connected by its islands in a\r\nchain with those of Burney, Macaçar, and Great Maluco. This nation\r\nmaintains only one excellence--at the cost, [however,] of its brutal\r\ncondition and wretched mode of life--namely, its liberty. No power,\r\nnot even that of our Spaniards, has been able to subjugate them. They\r\nare so free in their indomitable barbarism that they will not suffer\r\nany subordination among them, not even that which fraternal feeling\r\nfor their own people might bring about if they recognized dignities\r\nor any organized form of social life. [51]\r\n\r\nThe Lutaos of Jolo have all their communication with the Borneans,\r\nraising the trident of their king [52] in the villages of that enormous\r\nisland. There they are judged to be one people [with the Borneans],\r\nand are declared such by the fraternal intercourse that they maintain\r\namong themselves--being related by marriage, and conspiring together\r\nwith their arms for the invasion of these islands, where their\r\nsquadrons are seen daily under one and the same banner.\r\n\r\nBut the rulers and nobility of all the islands of Jolo and Basilan\r\nrecognize as the place of their origin the village of Butuan (which,\r\nalthough it is located in this island, is within the pale of the\r\nVisayan nation) on the northern side, in sight of the island of Bool,\r\nand but a few leguas away from Leyte and from Bool, islands which are\r\nin the same stage of civilization. Therefore, that village can glory\r\nat having given kings and nobility to these nations. It is not so long\r\nago since the branches which flourish so well today were lopped from\r\ntheir trunk, that the memory charged with the event that divided them\r\ncan have forgotten it. The old king of Joló who is now living [i.e.,\r\nBongso], saw the one who was dismembered from his people, and whom\r\nmisfortunes exiled from his fatherland in order to make him venture on\r\nanother's land, thus giving him the foundation of so warlike a kingdom,\r\nwhich is so feared in these regions. Inasmuch as the tender beginnings\r\nof this new kingdom gathered encouragement from the protection of\r\nour arms, which it enjoyed for some time as pacific and tributary,\r\nit will be well to relate its beginnings before time obscures them.\r\n\r\nThe dissensions of two brothers obliged the less powerful to seek,\r\nby way of exile, a path to liberty which oppression denied him. Those\r\naffected to him accompanied him, and with them, seeking a land to\r\nhis liking, he hit upon the island of Basilan. The one who stirred up\r\nthat people was named Paguian Tindig, [53] then a title of nobility,\r\nand today the legacy of kings and princes of the blood royal in the\r\nisland of Joló. In his company he took his cousin, one Adasaolan,\r\nwhom his fate gave to him in order to maintain its enmity to\r\nhim. Some of those in his company allowed themselves to be led away\r\nby the fertility and abundance of this island and remained behind,\r\ncaptivated by its advantages. With the rest Tindig went to Joló,\r\nwhither the report of its wealth, the advantages of its seas and\r\nislands, and the fertility of its mountains carried him. They easily\r\nconquered the natives, who were barbarians and unaccustomed to the\r\nrigors and ambitions of war. They remained as rulers of the island,\r\nand their prince was Paguian Tindig, who, as subject to the Spaniards\r\n(who had already subdued the river of Butuan), continued in the same\r\nallegiance and paid them tribute. His cousin Adasaolan he married to a\r\ndaughter of Dimasangcay, [54] the king of Mindanao named Paguian Goan\r\n(a dangerous plan) in order to give himself power in the rivalry [with\r\nhis brother]. The mother of Corralat, by name Imbog, was a Joloan, and\r\nwith the communication indispensable to relationship easily infected\r\nAdasaolan with the perfidy of Mahomet, and the tyranny and violence\r\nof his law; and he, puffed up by the favor of the Mindanao king,\r\nand confident of his help, which their relationship promised him,\r\nplanned to kill his cousin, in order that he might remain absolute\r\nmaster of the island. He blockaded him, unprepared, in his house\r\nwith four hundred men who had gathered to his standards. But in\r\na happening not expected or feared, love acted, being forewarned,\r\nand innocence, being offended. And since there is no confusion that\r\nblinds the courage of foresight, he had taken the precaution to pour\r\ndown along the supports of the house (which are here called arigues,\r\nand are of strong wood) a quantity of oil, which rendered the scaling\r\nmore difficult; and the besiegers, finding more resistance than their\r\npresumption imagined, and yielding to so great force, retired. Tindig\r\nrecognized the difficulty in which he was, and considered war as\r\ndeclared and broken out; and, in order not to stain it with blood\r\nat the cost of his men, planned to absent himself and look for aid,\r\nrespect for which would ensure his condition. He went to Manila for\r\nthat purpose, having repressed the forefront of his danger, and,\r\nas a tributary and subject prince, easily secured the pledge of our\r\narms for his help; and, because he alone could measure the force with\r\nthe necessity, the means was left to his choice. He thought that two\r\nwell-armed caracoas would be enough, and, although a powerful fleet\r\nwas offered him, he refused to accept it; for he considered himself\r\nas invincible in his joanga, if reënforced by two Spanish caracoas.\r\n\r\nHis absence made his rival powerful, for the party without a leader\r\nreadily unites with that side that has one; and, the cause of the\r\nrivalry being wanting, tyranny easily united the forces of the\r\nisland. Eight well-armed joangas were prepared by Adasaolan, which\r\nwere given to him by Buhisan, the father of Corralat; and Tindig,\r\nhaving come within sight of Joló, went ahead with a lack of caution,\r\nto prepare his people, as he did not believe that the party of his\r\ncousin was so in the ascendancy. The enemy who were awaiting him,\r\nall ready, as soon as they saw his joanga without the shelter of the\r\ncaracoas, all surrounded it and boarded it, with the determination to\r\nfinish the war at one stroke. Ours who were coming behind could not\r\naid him; for he had gone on ahead, as we have said, to advise his men,\r\nand to notify his enemies of the war, so that fear could accomplish\r\nwhat he desired without recourse to arms. Overcome by the multitude\r\nrather than yielding to force, he was killed. He died unconquerable,\r\nhis death leaving the tyrant assured of power. The king of Joló,\r\nRaya Bongso, who was punished by Governor Don Sebastian Hurtado\r\nde Corcuera, in his conquest of Joló, is a good witness of this\r\ncontest. He, without much questioning, showed even the wounds that\r\nhe received on that occasion, fighting, although but a lad, at the\r\nside of Paguian Tindig, who was his relative.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards having arrived, and the cause of their fighting (the\r\nprotection of him who had fallen) being now removed, and not finding\r\nanyone with whom to fight, returned to Manila. The tyrant, flushed\r\nwith his victory, and being greedy with the hopes that great captures\r\nwere assured to him in the islands with alliance with the Mindanaos\r\nand Borneans, united himself to them; and following their fleets,\r\nwith so good masters of piracy his people became so great pirates,\r\nthat they surpassed all in deeds, and by themselves caused so great\r\nhavoc throughout the islands that they have proved the heaviest scourge\r\nthat these natives have suffered. And refusing obedience to his Majesty\r\nand the tribute which they have always paid, that principality [of\r\nJoló] was founded and has less antiquity in these islands than the\r\nSpaniards. [55]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n    Beliefs and superstitions of these islands\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general condition of these islands is paganism. From Sangil to\r\nSamboangan, the dwellers along the beach follow the law of Mahomet,\r\nas well as those of the islands of Basilan and Joló. This last is the\r\nmetropolis of the false religion, and the Mecca of this archipelago;\r\nfor there is the tomb of their first master, concerning whom the\r\ncaciques [i.e., Kasis], for the credit of his deceits, have been\r\nestablishing innumerable fables, which have already become a lying\r\ntradition in this century. One is that he came from Paradise with\r\nthree others, of whom one went to Java, and another to Burney, and\r\nthe other two landed at Joló, and thence one went to Mindanao. He of\r\nMindanao was ill received; and because of that, and of having been\r\nshipwrecked in the sea by driving on a reef, he went in anger to an\r\nisland to become a hermit, walking upon the water. But he who was\r\nwrecked in a ship could ill keep his footing in the water. Such is the\r\ncharacter of lies, that some are quite contrary to others. The outfit\r\nthat he carried consisted of a net, and it is said that he caught\r\nfish on the mountain with it, by dragging it over the ground. But if\r\nhe found fish on the mountain then the fish surely could not escape\r\nhim, unless indeed it were a flying-fish. When his followers went\r\nto seek him, Satan had already carried him away, and they found only\r\nthe net--and that stretched out, for it had been placed to dry. From\r\nthat point they took occasion to discuss so disconnected bits of\r\nnonsense as we have mentioned. Thereupon he who remained in Joló\r\nobtained the chair of the evil [doctrine], and, as he is accredited\r\nwith not fewer deceits, he was able to authorize his person and his\r\ndoctrine with the barbarians; for he also gave them to understand that\r\nhe could get fresh water from the sea, that he could sail on land,\r\nand could establish fisheries on the mountain, as did the other. The\r\nuse of these errors gave authority for the common people to invent\r\nothers. They believe that the enchanted boat which they never saw, and\r\nwhose anchorage they never knew, still exists. The respect that his\r\ndeceits gained him in life became ignorant and infamous adoration at\r\nhis death. A sepulcher was erected for him, which became the mausoleum\r\nof his memory, and the Mecca of his deceits. They erected it on the\r\nfamous hill [of Joló], and it was very elegant. [56] At its foot they\r\nplanted the singular fruit which they call the king's fruit, [57]\r\nwhich is unique in this archipelago, and of which no one ate except\r\nhimself, although for devotion the shells were given to the others. As\r\nwe said, they planted many jasmines, and made their defenses there,\r\nso that animals might not defile the mausoleum. As an entrance to it,\r\nthere was arranged in front of it a little house which was placed at\r\nthe beginning of the stockade, as if it were an entrance into the well\r\nof St. Patrick. There they made their offerings, all of which went to\r\nthe benefit of the prebendaries of the house, who were generally of\r\nthe blood of the hypocrite. Thence they took their auguries for the\r\nwar, for, putting water in a vase, together with some earth from the\r\nsepulcher, if it became bitter to the taste the outcome would be bad;\r\nbut if sweet, it would be happy. It is said that this test was made\r\nfor the war waged on them by Don Sebastian, in consequence of which\r\nthe king was always inclined to treat for peace.\r\n\r\nBy the entrance of our forces upon the hill, that place lost its\r\nworship and esteem; for the soldiers turned it all upside down, and\r\ndug it up in the hope of finding some treasure, and found no trace of\r\na human body. The Indians were terrified at their boldness, and asked\r\nwhether those who dared to do so much would not die. Thereupon, those\r\npeople were left with only the staff [of that teacher], which the Kasis\r\n[caciques] keep; for that is the staff of all virtues, and in going\r\nout with it (which is at the time of any necessity), all make it great\r\nreverence, and attend to all that is asked of them. For if they do not\r\ndo so, he excommunicates them, with two blows with it which he gives\r\non the house or the boat, and there can be neither health in the one\r\nor good luck in the other. All these are the artifices of cupidity,\r\nwhich holds them fast in a deceitful fear by vain terrors.\r\n\r\nThe other relic is the cap, [58] which is the hereditary possession\r\nof the kings, and to swear by it is to use the sanction of a great\r\nsacrament.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding so many lies that are made up to sustain this deceit,\r\nthere are but few who esteem it; and in general they are all atheists,\r\nand those who have any religion are sorcerers. For as Moros, beyond not\r\neating pork, and practicing circumcision, and [having] a multiplicity\r\nof women, they know not anything. They drink wine more than we do, and\r\nall their happiness consists in drunken revels--[to them] a positive\r\nact of greatness; and thus all their knightly deeds consist in emptying\r\nmore or fewer jars [of wine], and there is a wedding in which they\r\nempty two hundred. All their festivals consist in this. They live in\r\nall respects like men without any law who do not know God, and without\r\nany mode of worship, and unmindful that there is such in the world. All\r\nregard the law as little more or less, and, according to the land they\r\ninhabit, follow its customs and laws. Accordingly they are neither\r\nMoors, heathen, nor Christians, but barbarous atheists. Corralat,\r\nwho has civilized his country somewhat, has his mosque, and makes\r\nhis people attend it. But when they leave their village, each one\r\ndoes as he pleases--except some of the chiefs, who, following the\r\nexample of the king, have made it a point of honor to appear to be\r\nMoors. But the common people, assuredly, lay no stress on that point.\r\n\r\nWhat they believe in thoroughly are omens, which are almost general in\r\nall the islands. There are many of them: of birds, like the limocon;\r\n[59] of insects, like the lizard; of accidental occurrences, like\r\nsneezing; of happenings, like deaths or earthquakes; of observances\r\nat time of sowing, and of reaping, and of the hunt--all of these have\r\ntheir observances, which they fulfil in order to have luck in the\r\nwork; for they believe that without these it will be unlucky, and\r\nwithout any profit. Therefore, they do not undertake those things,\r\nsince in many districts it is considered an omen when anyone asks\r\nfor a portion of what may be caught (as for instance, of the hunter\r\nor fisher), if we say to him when he goes to try his luck: \"Divide\r\nwith me what you shall catch.\" They consider that as a bad omen, and\r\nreturn to their house, for they believe that they will catch nothing.\r\n\r\nThose who are atheists knowingly are the dwellers in mountains;\r\nfor they have no mosques, or shrines, or any method of praying to\r\nGod. Those upon whom they call in their illnesses are their ancestors,\r\nsaying \"Alas, my mother!\" or \"my grandfather.\" That is rather the\r\nnatural expression of pain than a prayer in which they experience any\r\nefficacy. Where there are some to whom the devil talks (which was more\r\nusual in their antiquity), such people offer him their sacrifices,\r\n[60] and the Indians have recourse to them in their illnesses, so\r\nthat they could make the same efforts for them. Today the Christian\r\ntruth has obscured the falsity of hell. At most, the descendants of\r\nthose ministers of the devil, who were generally women, do what they\r\nsaw them do without the devil taking any notice of them or talking\r\nto them. Others, who lay but small stress on all that, do what they\r\nheard said was the custom in the days of their antiquity, let happen\r\nwhat would. But they do it with so little earnestness that it appears\r\nto be levity rather than religion. With the same fervor they follow\r\nany other rule, so that they always remain without any law, unless it\r\nbe where the energy and incessant constancy of the missionaries has\r\nmade them forget their ancient customs, and with continual instruction\r\nhas made it easy for them to accept the new things of our holy faith.\r\n\r\nIn Caraga there was a barbarous custom to make their ships lucky,\r\nnamely, to vow to them the first time upon some name, which was\r\ngenerally the name of one of their captives.\r\n\r\nThat which has great value in all parts is sorcery; and they hold it\r\nin such high esteem that the father hides it from the son, and unless\r\nthey receive a great profit they refuse to communicate any secret of\r\nit. The famous sorcerers are feared, although there is no one who is\r\nnot ashamed of being called thus, and the word \"sorcerer\" is one of\r\nthe insulting words of these natives. My judgment from seeing these\r\n[sorceries], so alike, is that they are implicit compacts made with\r\ntheir ancestors. For it also seems impossible that there are herbs\r\nof so powerful poison that they can kill so instantly that some\r\npersons kill, with only the breath alone by chewing those herbs;\r\nand others, by burying those herbs where one has to pass. They also\r\nuse figures, which they dedicate to him whom they wish to harm, and\r\nthese accordingly torment him; the figure continues to aggravate the\r\nevil upon the sorcerer's enemy. Others work by letters, and that is\r\npeculiar to the Moro Kasis [caciques], although the most of all this\r\nis fabulous; but as they imagine that it is true, for any accident\r\nfor which they find no remedy, and of whose cause they are ignorant,\r\nthey throw the blame on the sorcerer. It is recounted of the king\r\nof Burney that, on learning the name of one, he can kill him if he\r\nchooses. Sargento-mayor Pedro Duran Monforte having made war in his\r\nland, the king was informed of his name, and said that since he knew\r\nhis name, therefore Monforte could not live much longer, and with that\r\nhe consoled his people. But thanks to God, the sargento-mayor has been\r\nliving for three years since that threat. Thus are all their affairs.\r\n\r\nHe who unites the excellency of a powerful sorcerer to Mahometan\r\nardor is King Corralat. He causes the fish to enter his boat. While\r\none of our fathers was in his boat, a fish leaped in; the king\r\npicked it up and, giving it to the father, said: \"This is for the\r\nfather.\" It is also related that he makes a piece of artillery float\r\non the surface of the water by placing an oar in its mouth. He has a\r\nsaker, which according to report, when fired, serves him as a good\r\nor evil augury. The fact is, that he talks very familiarly with\r\nthe devil. According to the tale of a Spaniard (and one for which\r\nhe vouched to me), when he was going from Samboangan on a certain\r\nembassy, just as he entered the river the favorite of Corralat told\r\nhim that, the night previous, his king had asked him whether any\r\nship were to be seen. To his negative answer the king said to him:\r\n\"Then take note that three ships will arrive tomorrow, and one of them\r\nwill be Spanish.\" That was a fact, for two ships from Java entered,\r\nand that of the said Spaniard. Thereupon the favorite exclaimed:\r\n\"Great Saint Corralat, there is no other truth.\" With such things\r\nhe has established so much credit that if God do not bury his body\r\nin the depths [of the sea], the Mindanaos will worship him and will\r\nfound another house of Mecca, such as they had in Joló. With that he\r\nhas become a greater king than any of his forbears; for their fear\r\nof him is incredible, as they recognize in him one who has superior\r\npower to avenge himself. Consequently, they do not dare undertake\r\nanything against his will; for they regard it as certain that they\r\nwill be unlucky. Since the devil has been so advantaged by that way,\r\nhe manages to make their fears come out true at times, by which credit\r\nfor the others is assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n    The moderation of their conduct, and the sobriety of their\r\n    living\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong all the Indians it is a general fact that in what relates to\r\ntheir own persons natural law is more conspicuous, and has a more\r\nfirmly established empire, than have the nations. Part of that is\r\nfounded on the slothfulness of their natures, and part on the rudeness\r\nof their civilization; the former makes them content with little, and\r\nthe latter causes them to ignore the niceties of art. Their food proves\r\nthe first well; and the havoc that they cause, the second. The food\r\nis very poor among the wealthy, and requires little labor; for they\r\nneither know condiments nor for that purpose are drugs valued among\r\nthem, of the use of all which they are ignorant. Both slave and ruler,\r\nplebeian and prince, eat bread; for, since that consists of a little\r\nboiled rice, one cannot eat it more adorned than the other. Since all\r\nof them are bakers of this bread, he who wishes to clean it better\r\neats it whiter. He who has no slaves to relieve him from that eats\r\nit as he chooses; and, consequently, there is no one who does not\r\nknow how to cook his food. For they are under the daily necessity,\r\neven the richest, of making it; and, as ostentation in ordinary life\r\nis so little, it is unavoidable that service is lacking to them on\r\ntheir voyages and navigations, so that they are forced to use their\r\nown hands. Those who do not obtain rice--either because the land does\r\nnot bear it, or because it is limited in any year--eat of many roots,\r\nwhich supply the lack fully, and which require no other preparation\r\nthan boiling. He who is so well served that he obtains a little\r\nfish, venison, or pork, with water and salt alone makes his stew,\r\nwithout the knowledge of other kinds of pottages. In order to give\r\ntheir food a sharp flavor, they are wont to cook it with some herbs\r\nof a sour taste. Consequently, in the seasoning of their food they\r\nconsume nothing, so that they save the cost of butter, oil, vinegar,\r\nand all spices. They are accustomed to make their puches [i.e.,\r\na sort of pap] and poleadas [i.e., a sort of fritter] from cocoanut\r\nmilk and the honey made from sugarcane, which are their preserves and\r\nroyal cakes. But such is at a great wedding or at a feast, where their\r\ndesire for ostentation arouses their endeavors. Such were presented to\r\nme by the king of Joló, Panguian Bachal, while I was visiting at his\r\ncourt. They consisted of a half-dozen small cakes made of rice flour\r\nand kneaded with cocoanut-milk, and baked until they turned dark,\r\nso that they appeared to be cinnamon to the sight. In fact the color\r\nwas due to the toasting and to a preserve, like turpentine, made from\r\nthe fruit of the durion with honey made from sugarcane. This is enough\r\nto turn the strongest stomachs--as it were, the chief dainty for the\r\nstomach of a bull--oppressive, as it was all night to the Queen mother;\r\n[61] and we satisfied ourselves with looking at it.\r\n\r\nTheir clothing is very simple, without stiffening or linings. All\r\nare dressed after the same style, and innovations due to curiosity\r\nare not allowed. As the country is so hot, they dress very loosely,\r\na fact which makes the cutting out very easy. Each one is the tailor\r\nof his own garments. This is the reason why the Indians are so lacking\r\nin the communal idea, and are so hostile to assembling and uniting\r\nin villages; for since their misery and laziness make them content\r\nwith the easiest and most natural, which all obtain, they do not need\r\none another. For in each house are found all the trades, and no one\r\nmakes use of them unless his own necessity compels him. If one goes\r\nto fish, he is content with what will satisfy either his appetite or\r\nhis necessity; and the desire of acquiring does not make him break\r\nwith his laziness in order to work.\r\n\r\nReturning to their clothes, the stuffs worn are generally common to\r\nnobles, and plebeians, kings and slaves, and there is no difference\r\nbetween them--except it be in something extraordinary, in which the\r\nobligation and ostentation of their chief persons induces them to\r\ndepart from their accustomed use. At such times they are wont to wear\r\nsilks and very beautiful stuffs, with buttons and gold lace. Their\r\nkrises (which are their inseparable weapons) have gilded scabbards\r\nand hilts of massy gold. I have seen some of them which were valued\r\nat nine slaves each, all covered with precious stones and perhaps\r\nencrusted with pearls. But in daily appearance all resemble one\r\nanother, both in the garments in which they dress and in the fashions\r\nthat they employ. These clothes consist of breeches and short jacket\r\n[ropilla]--or skirt, to be more accurate. That is not worn over\r\na shirt, for with them the first garment is not the shirt, but the\r\nskirt, for it is all one. Sometimes they wear a jacket with long\r\nskirts cut in the French style; which, although it can be buttoned,\r\nis generally worn open, with the breast exposed. In this particular\r\nthis nation is quite different from the others of this region. They use\r\nanother style of cut; the skirts and sleeves each ending in a point,\r\nand the ends which ought to close over the bosom are brought together\r\nin double points, fastened either with a button or with a knot, so that\r\nalmost all the breast is left open. The breeches are full and white,\r\nresembling those which the Spaniards wear for the sake of cleanliness\r\nunder their black ones. They are girt with a bit of native linen,\r\nso long that after having been knotted it hangs from the waist to the\r\nknees; and it serves to make their garb more decent than it would be\r\nbecause of the meagerness and thinness of the breeches. Or if they\r\ndo not have that, then they use two brazas' length of the same cloth\r\nor silk, which at its full width they wind about the body, joined in\r\nfront with one end crossed below the other. In that manner they cover\r\nthe breeches entirely, and the clothing is much more decent. In this\r\nusage, the gala costumes have special elaboration, and it displays\r\ntheir ostentation; for they are wont to wear cloth that is valued\r\nat thirty or forty reals of eight. They also wear breeches of the\r\nMalay fashion, which are closed like ours, although they are not so\r\ntight. It is the rule that they must be of silk with a gold fringe\r\nbelow, or with border and buttons of the same which among these people\r\nis always of filigree or of solid gold. In that they consider only\r\nostentation, without any risk of waste.\r\n\r\nOn the head, in the Moorish style, is worn a turban. Its use throughout\r\nthe Indias is general, but among these people inviolable. I do not\r\nknow whether it is because even their hearts are tinged with their\r\ncursed worship, or because of hatred to our nation and to our customs,\r\nor because of flattery to their natural arrogance--through which they\r\nwill never, of themselves, come to depreciate their own things. Even\r\nyet throughout the islands, those who are esteemed as chiefs are\r\nashamed of appearing without hats.\r\n\r\nThe clothing of the women is plainer, and such that it becomes\r\nindecent; for from the small mantas or textiles of these regions,\r\nwhich are all very thin, they make a sack nine palmos long and open at\r\nboth ends. They gird this in at the waist as much as may be necessary,\r\nso that it falls to the feet; what is left they allow to fall over the\r\nlegs, and it does not even reach to the knees, or necessarily serve\r\nfor the decency which modesty requires. They adjust it by drawing\r\nit close to one side of the body, and by making folds on the other\r\nside of all the extra width in proportion to their body. This sack,\r\nwhich by day is a garment--so shameful to decency, because it so ill\r\nsatisfies it--serves at night for mattress, sheets, and curtain. For\r\non retiring they ungird the sack, and the part which they doubled\r\nabout the knees they put up to the head. That is all the opulence\r\nand comfort that their beds can boast of, which are made of a thin\r\nmat. These are their Holland and Rouen linens, which serve for their\r\nopulence and their fastidious cleanliness. That is their whole wealth\r\nof quilts and covers, which protect them from the cold and from the\r\nmosquitoes. All is so exactly adapted to necessity, that there is\r\nno difference between the chief women and the slaves--as I saw in\r\nJoló in the queen herself, and in Samboangan in many other women,\r\nnot inferior to her in vanity. However, the women of highest rank,\r\non retiring let fall a curtain without a covering. And that is all\r\ntheir ostentation and the necessary obligation of modesty for the\r\nprotection from sight of those who are careless concerning their\r\nmanner of sleeping, in houses where there is no division of apartments,\r\nand where there can be no rooms for the multitude that inhabit them,\r\nand where the others throw themselves down pellmell on the floor. At\r\nmost, the master is protected by that little grandeur. This is in\r\nregard to the bed, for in dress no difference is known.\r\n\r\nThe gala dress of the women of this nation consists wholly of the\r\nshirt [sayuelo] which is made in the style usual to the Indians. It is\r\nhowever, drawn close about the breasts, and the sleeves are very long,\r\nat times each sleeve taking three or four varas of cloth. The sleeve is\r\ngathered at the wrist in a very fine and graceful plait, as the goods\r\nthat they wear are so delicate. They heighten that gala dress with\r\nthe wealth of gold, the use of which among these Indias extends to\r\nthe wrists, which they cover with bracelets, either solid or hollow,\r\nand a finger in width. On days of great display they generally wear\r\nthree or four pairs. The work is beautiful, and these add much to their\r\ngay and festive appearance; and they show off the arm loaded with such\r\nrich bracelets. For cloaks or mantles they wear textiles of fine silk,\r\nand at times of gold [tissue], which they call patolas [62] which is\r\na very beautiful and rich kind of goods. Generally, when they leave\r\nthe house they all wear very long black cloaks; that partly moderates\r\nthe ugliness and utter indecency of their dress--which of itself is,\r\nI know not whether more ugly or more immodest, with its sack above\r\nmentioned, which serves them as shirt and petticoat, without its\r\nhaving any distinction either for station, rank, or display.\r\n\r\nThe houses in which they reside have what is sufficient for their\r\nshelter and poor lodging. They have no salons where they can walk,\r\nor higher stories where they can amuse themselves, than that which\r\nseparates them from the ground. This is made with logs, upon which as\r\ncolumns they build their sills, to which they fasten the ends of the\r\nbeams with their keys. The roof is thatch, which nature furnished,\r\na provision very suitable to the needs of the country--which, as it\r\nis so subject to earthquakes, does not allow a greater weight without\r\ndanger to the buildings. The floor is of bamboos, split or otherwise\r\nprepared; for, as these are hollow, they can be split with the same\r\nease, thus avoiding the trouble and niceties of carpentry. Thus the\r\nfloor is like a grating, and is a necessary precaution of their natural\r\nlaziness and dirtiness; for by this way of making their floors they\r\navoid having to sweep them, since the houses can so easily be washed\r\nand rid of all dirt. They have no benches or chairs, and thus they\r\nget rid of the encumbrance of much furniture. They consider a seat on\r\nthe floor as more secure. They use tables somewhat; these are round\r\nand hollowed out in the middle, in the manner of an ordinary brasier,\r\nand are built wholly for use rather than for display. In that hollow\r\nthey put all their dishes, which consist of boiled rice, and fish\r\nof the same stew, without there being any danger of the food being\r\nspilled out. They use no tablecloths or napkins; and, although they use\r\ndishes somewhat, they do not usually feel the lack of these, as the\r\ntrees with their wide leaves furnish them a cleaner table-service,\r\nand the bamboos make them very tasteful jugs and bowls which are\r\nformed from their lengths between knots. These also form their jars;\r\nfor there is a kind of bamboo from which they make jars containing\r\nthree or four azumbres. [63] By cutting four joint-lengths and boring\r\nholes in them, they fill a good jar. The cocoanuts yield them cups,\r\nfor here these are very common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n    The laws of their private conduct and the general laws of\r\n    their government\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing are the laws pertaining to them privately as persons. They\r\nare as much adapted to the nature of the world (although more clothed\r\nwith innocence), as they are to their laziness and cupidity which\r\nprohibits them from all expense which is not necessary for life,\r\nas superfluous. For that I have always said of these natives that\r\nthey are fine philosophers, adapted to nature. The laws which touch\r\non other matters and have to do with their neighbors are quite at\r\nvariance with the laws of nature; and these extend to a tyranny\r\nso manifestly cruel that at times and in some things it comes to\r\nbe brutality. I have seen a son who held his father as slave, and,\r\nvice versa, a father who held his son as slave; for if one make an\r\noutlay for another, they take account of it, as would be done in\r\nthe case of a stranger. Inasmuch as this son had freed his father\r\nby buying him from his master, that man was reckoned as his son's\r\nslave, and the same would be true of the son. It may happen that a\r\nchief lowers himself [by having intercourse] with his slave-woman,\r\nand the son whom she bears may be so cruel that at the death of his\r\nfather he makes his own mother his slave. Even if, while they are at\r\npeace, these points are not cleared up, and the inner tyranny employs\r\nexternal civility, yet, if dissensions alter these relations, and they\r\nare divided, the men avail themselves of those rights, and subject\r\ntheir mothers to whatever they choose, and do not allow them to leave\r\ntheir houses. Thus do they come to be served by their mothers at all\r\ntimes. In regard to those who descend from them, there is even less\r\nshame; and among another kind of relations is an utter disregard of\r\nnature in this respect, for their own nephews are the slaves of their\r\nuncles, and, vice versa, uncles are slaves of their nephews.\r\n\r\nThey do not know what charity is. Consequently, whatever benefits\r\nthey confer are all placed on account as debts, which their tyranny\r\nestimates wholly to their own satisfaction. Unfortunate he whom\r\nabandonment or orphanage has flung into the house of another, for\r\nnow for his sustenance, and again for his rearing, he must become\r\na slave. Kindness is shown at the cost of liberty. Although that\r\nwas general throughout the islands, in this island it is excessive,\r\nas it is a tenet of the perfidious sect of Mahomet; and its cruelty\r\nhas left no liberty that it has not opposed. Therefore, there is not\r\nin this nation the middle class that is found in the others which\r\nforms the common people out of the freemen; for there are no freemen,\r\nnor any mean between chiefs and slaves. Their community is composed\r\nof but two extremes, so far separated. It is a fact that there are\r\nmany ways by which to reduce men to such a condition, and there is no\r\nescape from the injury. For, since self-interest is the advantage of\r\nthose who are powerful, it unites them against the unfortunate one\r\nwho dares to proclaim the offense that has been done to him, while\r\nhis punishment conciliates so many other offenders who might perplex\r\njustice; and fear shuts the mouths of those whom the same fortune might\r\ngain to his favor in the support of his testimonies. Therefore, when\r\nit comes to proof there is always a lack of witnesses for innocence;\r\nwhile on the contrary there is for tyranny an oversupply of ocular\r\nwitnesses of things that they have never seen or heard. When some\r\nstranger goes to a village to trade where he does not have the\r\nguaranteed patronage of many powerful relations, in the case of any\r\nneglect that is shown him in courtesy or in the laws, they bring\r\nsuch a case against him that to get out of it well he abandons his\r\nbusiness and perhaps with his business his freedom. The worst of it\r\nis that the punishment is always more than the offense, for the just\r\npay as if they were sinners. Their avarice or tyranny not satisfied\r\nwith the vengeance taken on the criminal makes the offense related to\r\nthe very blood, in order to extend their cupidity farther. Hence it\r\nis that on account of the crime committed by a single one, they make\r\nall the relations slaves. I saw four brothers who were all deprived\r\nof their inherited freedom because of the incivility and weakness of\r\none. Finding myself in Iligan--a nation which, as it is so new, is\r\neven yet throwing out the sparks of this tyrannical fury it happened\r\nthat a common woman spoke some insulting words to another woman who\r\nhad rank; and the latter's husband, coming to me to make a complaint,\r\nsaid to me, exaggerating the offense: \"Father, if the Spaniards were\r\nnot here, and we could rule ourselves by our own laws, we would have\r\nmade mincemeat [gigote] of that woman with a campilan, and slaves\r\nof her brothers and sisters and relatives.\" Finally, he whom avarice\r\nrules with a tyrannical power (for all their laws end in self-interest)\r\ngets usury from his offense and employment from his crime.\r\n\r\nAvarice rules in all their judgments; and the purse becomes the gallows\r\nof all crimes. Money is the vengeance of the aggrieved parties, and\r\nthe sponge for injuries. When they are paid for, no spot or sign of\r\nthe offense is left. Although there are crimes which bear especially\r\na capital penalty, yet there is no penalty that cannot be redeemed by\r\nmoney or goods. He who has no possessions at all has still liberty,\r\nand can surrender that also. That is the road most traveled by which\r\nsome come to be the slaves of others; and perhaps the chief, if he be\r\npoor, may be the slave of another who is a plebeian. When anyone is\r\ncaught in adultery, if sudden wrath does not execute him, which is\r\nbut seldom, the wounds are passed on to his purse, in the endeavor\r\nto destroy him, and the husband subjects his own wife to the same\r\nharshness and penalty. For here all persons have a separate purse,\r\nand the husband is not master of what his wife possesses but only of\r\nwhat pertains to him. Nor, under pretext of managing her possessions,\r\ndoes he have more to do with it than the extent of her permission;\r\nand she is always mistress of her own possessions. Thus she pays\r\na fine to her own husband, as if she were a stranger to him. Having\r\nreceived this, the aggrieved party remains as satisfied as when, among\r\nthe Spaniards, one sword has pinned both guilty ones together. The\r\noffender retains a privilege truly insulting and barbarous--that for\r\none year he may have intercourse with the woman without her husband\r\ncomplaining. Then the husband and wife return in all peace to cohabit\r\nas before, the offense being again at risk, for another atonement.\r\n\r\nThey especially abhor theft, and they have assigned an ignominious\r\npenalty for the thief, as a warning. This is to cut off the joints\r\nof his fingers, more or fewer according to the crime. That perhaps\r\nobliges them to pass from the hands to the toes, the penalty being\r\nproportioned to the misdeeds of greater atrocity. But that penalty\r\ncan also be redeemed, as can the others, by money.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that, some crimes they regard as so capital that they\r\ndo not respect petitions or allow bribes, and death is the necessary\r\npunishment for them. The unnatural crime is one of them, and the\r\nseverity of the execution well shows their natural horror, for such\r\npeople are burned, and their houses; and nothing that they possessed\r\nis allowed to escape from this rigor, as being contaminated. Or,\r\nhaving caged the offenders, they throw them into the sea, and destroy\r\ntheir houses and fields, by such punishment to make demonstration of\r\ntheir abhorrence.\r\n\r\nThe most feared crime is that which they call sumban, which is incest\r\nin the first degree; for they regard it as assured by long experience\r\nand knowledge inherited in tradition from their ancestors, that\r\nthe land which allows that crime is bound down by wretchedness and\r\nmisfortunes until its infamy is purged by the rigorous chastisement\r\nof the offender. There is no other means which can placate the wrath\r\nof heaven. Consequently, when they suffer long droughts, or other\r\ngeneral plagues from heaven, they immediately attribute them to\r\nthis. A case of that nature came to my notice in the year fifty-one,\r\nwhen the drought was general, and so great that even the water of\r\nthe rivers failed, and that river which had any water that found its\r\nway to the sea was rare. The Indians of the village which was in my\r\ncare on the coast of Siocon came to tell me that it was a punishment\r\nfrom the sky, and that it had been demanded by the awfulness of\r\nsuch crime on the coast of Mindanao, where they said that a mother\r\nwas living in marriage with her son. They petitioned me to have\r\nthe offenders punished, and warned me that the punishment should be\r\ndeath without remission, such being their custom, without admitting\r\nsatisfaction by any other penalty, however excessive it be. The same\r\nreport was current in the island of Basilan. However, it was without\r\nother foundation than that the Indians are gossipy and suspicious,\r\nignorant of the secrets of the sky and ruled by the traditions of the\r\npast. They are ruled in that island by greater fear, as they retained\r\nmore accurately in their memory certain cases that served them as\r\nexamples and warnings. For, at a certain time, the sky was so leaden\r\nthat for two years not a drop of rain fell. There was an Indian who\r\nviolated the respect that he owed to his blood and to nature, with\r\nregard to a daughter of his. Although he tried to bury the crime in\r\nthe depths of his silence, it cried out to the sky as an offense,\r\nand was heard distinctly as a sin; for the effect, as ungrateful as\r\nevil, always turns against its cause. He was a person of influence,\r\nand respect for him did not allow any investigation to be made;\r\nbut, the villages grieving over the public calamity, and unable to\r\nendure their forced famine, men trampled under foot respect and laws,\r\nin their judgment that tolerance in so execrable an evil had also\r\nvexed and hardened the sky. By common consent they seized father and\r\ndaughter, and, shutting them up in a cage well weighted with stones,\r\nthrew them into the sea. In return they experienced from the sky\r\napprobation for their avenging zeal, in the heavy rain with which it\r\nreceived them. For at all times God preserves the credit to virtue,\r\nand even among barbarians imposed penance on vice, so that those who\r\nbecame familiars of vice could have no excuse. [64]\r\n\r\nThe Joloans executed the same punishment with equal severity, but\r\nthrough malicious information. God, who is always the protector of\r\ninnocence, shielded the wretched; for when they cast two other fathers\r\nin the same manner [into the water], he took away the weight of the\r\nstones, and gave the men strength to keep afloat, without abandoning\r\nthem for a whole day, so that, the report of the matter having\r\nreached the king, the wonder forced him to seek new information,\r\nby which he discovered falsity and recognized innocence. In all the\r\nnations innocence considers God as its advocate, and in desperate\r\ncases rests secure on His protection.\r\n\r\nJudges in suits or causes follow the simple laws of nature, and have no\r\nembarrassment of laws and doubts and contrary interpretations. They\r\nhave no delays by reports or prolixity of writs, for they do not\r\nwaste a single dedo [65] of paper in that. The accusation, the plea,\r\nand the evidence are quickly heard--all in the manner of the time\r\nof Noah. If there is no testimony, they admit the parties to the\r\noath, which contains terrifying imprecations. With that plea the\r\nparty is usually content; for the obligation and risk, to which he\r\nis exposed by results which are reckoned as punishments of heaven\r\nagainst perjured ones if the rigor of their imprecations is executed,\r\nare greatly feared. If perchance the party is satisfied that he has\r\ntruth on his side, at his petition they do not rest content with that\r\ntrial, but judgment of red-hot coals or hot iron, [66] such as was\r\nresorted to in España and other countries, in centuries ruder and more\r\nimmune from laws by the privilege of their innocence and goodness. If\r\nthe persons are burned, then their punishment is proceeded with;\r\nand if not, the accuser is obliged to make requital. That custom\r\nseems to have been communicated by the Moros by way of Terrenate,\r\nwhere it is still observed. However, no one is burned, for since\r\nthe Ternatans are so skilled in sorcery, they know herbs of such\r\nefficacy and bewitchments of such power, that they communicate it to\r\nthe hands so that they can handle the iron with impunity, as if it\r\nwere a nosegay of flowers. Also many of those whom they bury alive,\r\nthat being the punishment of adultery and rape, escape. I say this,\r\nfor it often occurred that persons escaped from the execution of\r\nthis test, in the sight of the Spaniards at Ternate, women whose\r\nguilt was notorious, but who cleared themselves of suspicion among\r\ntheir people by this proof. I was told many happenings of this sort,\r\nduring the time that I spent in those islands [i.e., the Moluccas];\r\nand I was assured that it was done by means of an herb, and I was\r\nshown some that were famous in its knowledge. These were the ones\r\nto whom the accused had recourse in all their exigencies, suborning\r\ntheir expertness with a quantity of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n    The form of government of these natives\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kings, although so tyrannical in government, and in power so\r\nbeyond the affliction and trouble which authority and ostentation\r\nincur, yet according to the condition of their poverty maintain the\r\nform and authority of a court. Peace affairs are in charge of a chief\r\njustice or counselor, called zarabandal. That is the greatest court\r\ntitle and he decides the causes and suits, and advises concerning the\r\nsentence. In the outside villages where the king does not reside,\r\nthe chiefs meddle wherever they wish, without other law than their\r\npower and will, and their unbridled greed; and the one injured has\r\nno recourse, for, in quarrels between the plebeians and chiefs, the\r\nking always takes the part of the latter--who are more powerful, and\r\nare those who can make trouble for him, and even deprive him of his\r\nkingdom. For his principate is founded more on the recognition that\r\nthey make of his nobility than on any absolute power which secures to\r\nhim their vassalage; since a slave will say \"no\" to the king in what\r\ndoes not suit him. That happened in Joló, in the presence of Father\r\nAlexandro Lopez. When the father was negotiating through the medium of\r\nthe king to have the ransom for a Christian put at a humane figure,\r\nthe other, a Joloan slave by condition, who had the Christian in his\r\npower, said to the very face of the king, when the latter asked him to\r\nconform to the prices settled upon in the treaty of peace, [67] that\r\nhe would not do it; and that was the end of the matter. That signified\r\nthat the king's power in execution extended just so far as his vassals\r\nwished, and that they would obey him just so far as it pleased them.\r\n\r\nThey have established orders of nobility, with a distinction of titles\r\nwhich aggrandize it. Some are called Tuam, which is the same as \"Señor\"\r\nor the title applied to men in España. Others are given the title\r\nof Orancaya, which signifies \"rich man;\" it is the greatest title,\r\nand equivalent to grandee of their kingdom. It is equivalent to the\r\nsame title that España gave to its grandees when his Majesty used\r\nmore simplicity, and called them Ricos-Homes [i.e., \"rich men\"]. The\r\nrest are called chiefs, and correspond to what we call caballeros and\r\nHijos-dalgo [i.e., \"knights and nobles\"]. They have no greater dignity\r\nthan the honor. Those of the blood royal are called cachiles following\r\nthe custom and style of the kings of Maluco, Terrenate, Tidores,\r\nand Xilolos. The same in the peculiar style of Joló are called Paguian.\r\n\r\nThe Orangcayas or Ricos-Homes become the rulers of vassals, and\r\nhave some villages in their charge. In those villages, although\r\nthe king is recognized, and tribute sent to him, in all else those\r\nrulers are absolute; and especially in government affairs are they\r\nindependent. They are the ones who tyrannize most ungovernably over\r\nthe people; for whatever fine the king imposes upon them, or whatever\r\ngift he requests from them, they lay hands upon their subjects, and,\r\nas if they were slaves they take away the son from the father in order\r\nto sell him. That has been the case so often that, even since they\r\nhave been made subject to our government, it has been necessary to\r\nexamine with close attention, whenever they bring any slave to sell,\r\nthe reason for his slavery; for it has been found that they sell\r\nus many slaves without any other right than that of their tyranny,\r\nrelieving their necessities and making their payments with the first\r\nperson whom they meet--bringing him, beguiled by some other pretext,\r\nto the Spaniards; and the injury was suffered without any complaint,\r\nbecause of the incapacity and dullness of the poor Subanos. The\r\nlatter, as they are so unused to intercourse with us, and so shut up\r\nin their own lives, had no arguments to oppose to what they did not\r\nunderstand; and showed their wonder, surprise, and bashfulness in\r\nbrute silence. For that reason, where the Orangcayas govern (which\r\nare almost all villages of the Subanos or Indians of the mountain),\r\nthere is scarce one who enjoys liberty. Those chiefs hold them so\r\nunder their power, that they regard the very leaders and chiefs of\r\nthe Subano nation as their slaves. That I experienced on a visit which\r\nI made on a dangerous occasion, when in order to assure the minds of\r\nthe people I took with me a Lutao chief who was the absolute master\r\nbefore the Spaniards entered, and to whom they still paid hereditary\r\nrespect along all the coast of Siocon. Being, then, with all the\r\npeople and chiefs of the nation assembled together in a village, and\r\nI endeavoring to honor them with signs of the greatest affection,\r\nthe Lutao said: \"Do not pay any attention to these people, Father,\r\nfor they are all my slaves.\" This he said in a place where we two and\r\nthe chiefs of the village were alone. I thought that that contempt\r\nand arrogance would arouse them; but on the contrary, it softened\r\nthem, as the affection and presents of a loving prince would his\r\nhumble vassal. And, although they were not slaves, the respect\r\nin which they were born gives the chiefs so much authority, that\r\nalthough we [Spaniards] possess the rule, they, as chiefs, command\r\nthe people. And, as the latter were reared in that tyranny, their\r\nnatural disposition made them show respect and natural submission;\r\nfor, notwithstanding the immunity that our arms give them, they obey\r\nthose chiefs better than they do us. May that be tempered in part by\r\nthe Christian government, and the vigilance of our father ministers,\r\nand the recourse which they find in the royal officials. For a chief\r\nof those natives who was governor of the village of Baluasan, near\r\nto Samboangan, when speaking of the wretched subjection in which the\r\nLutaos held them, and the good fortune that had come to them with\r\nthe entrance of our government, by restraining the Lutao tyranny,\r\nand giving arms to persecuted liberty, spoke to me these words:\r\n\"If you [Spaniards] had not arrived when you did, there would now\r\nnot be any of us left; for we would already have been finished, and\r\nbartered for goods with the people of Macasar.\" These words consoled\r\nme, on account of the fidelity which the interest and recognized\r\nadvantages of that barbarian guaranteed. [68]\r\n\r\nSuch was the government maintained by Corralat. And since he made\r\nall of them so powerful, giving them special power by laws, he was\r\nvery acceptable to the princes of his nation and therefore most\r\nsecure. These men, then, are the ones who grieve over the losses\r\nsustained by the change, who see themselves put under holy laws and\r\njust--they who before had no other laws than those of their own will,\r\nand their unbridled ambition, laws from which the others suffered as\r\na servile, cowardly, and rude nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n    Some peculiarities of the customs of the Subanos\r\n\r\n\r\nThe customs of the Subanos or Indians of the mountains there is no\r\nreason for relating; for with more hideous extremes they maintain the\r\nevils of the Lutaos, while those peculiar to them are, as it were, the\r\nbrutal creatures among other citizens. But that even will add praises\r\nto the changes that have resulted from the skill of the Omnipotent,\r\nand to the zeal of the missionaries, by whose means virtue produced\r\nthe civilized and Christian conduct which now is theirs. Their dress\r\napproaches that of the inhabitants of the beach with whom they have\r\ncommunication. Accordingly, those who traffic with Lutaos or Moros\r\ndress in their style; while those familiar with the Visayan nations\r\n(such as the peoples of Caraga and the coast of Dapitan), through\r\ncommerce with them, follow their custom. All their government is\r\nconfusion, and they wage war, not some nations with others, nor one\r\nvillage with another, but all are, as it were, enemies of the human\r\nrace. Armed against one another, without subordination or greater\r\nsubjection than what the might and act of violence of the boldest\r\nobtained, they had no other laws in their causes that the might of\r\nthe one provoked to avenge himself; and his rigor, even in the worst\r\ncases, was appeased by gifts. Thus when a Subano came to acquire a poor\r\ncapital that would enable him to pay for a murder, he committed the\r\nmurder with the greatest safety, in order that he might be enrolled\r\nin the number of valiant and to have authority as such to wear a red\r\nturban. Because of that barbaric vanity they would kill their best\r\nfriend, if they caught him asleep or off his guard; for the barbaric\r\ncourage of these nations does not consider posts of reputation, but\r\nthose of security. In Caraga there was a more atrocious custom; for, in\r\norder to be able to clothe oneself in the dress of the valiant--namely,\r\na striped turban, and breeches of their peculiar style (which they call\r\nbaxaque) with similar stripes--one must have killed seven men. [69]\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of this nation, and the thing that gives them\r\nsome excellence and esteem, is that their women are more chaste and\r\nmodest. They esteem virginity, and keep it inviolate, even to advanced\r\nage, for the vocation of matrimony. It is true that this virtue is\r\naided by their natural disposition, which furnishes for the defense of\r\nchastity their native stupidity and shyness; but therewith they succeed\r\nin an undertaking which among Lutaos and the other nations of these\r\nislands is rare and difficult indeed. This has secured them so much\r\nesteem and confidence in this region that the chiefs of high standing\r\namong the Lutaos, in order to guard their daughters more safely,\r\nhave them reared among Subanos; and they do not take them into the\r\ndangerous camp of their own nation unless it is to establish them in\r\nmarriage, and with that station, in safety, as they think. Among this\r\nnation there is a class of men who profess celibacy [70] and govern\r\nthemselves by natural law, and they are very punctual and perfect in\r\ntheir observance of it; and such is the feeling of security in regard\r\nto them, that they are allowed to go about among the women without any\r\nfear or suspicion. Their dress is throughout like that of the women,\r\nwith skirts of the same fashion. They do not use weapons, or engage in\r\nanything else that is peculiar to men, or communicate with them. They\r\nweave the mantas that are used here, which is the proper employment\r\nof women, and all their conversation is with women. Therefore, the\r\npurpose of life which they follow comes to be more extraordinary by\r\nits peculiarity and by its perils, considering both the nature of that\r\ncountry, and the little regard that they give to their dangers. So\r\nsatisfied do they live, either from their own purpose or from their\r\nnatural disposition, that they have never discredited their position\r\nwith weaknesses. They were, so to speak, hermits of their religion, and\r\nwere held in high esteem. And in fact the constancy of their life and\r\nmodesty of their customs, obliged one to have respect for them. In a\r\nnation so barbarous and who knew not God, it appears a prodigy worthy\r\nof wonder that one of the special providences of His Divine Majesty,\r\nto place such examples of virtue in a country where vice had absolute\r\ncontrol, so that the experience of the eyes causes them to esteem\r\nwhat God's love did not obtain. I have known two of these men, and\r\none of them I baptized, to my especial consolation, while visiting\r\nthe coast of Siocon, which extends for twenty leguas from Samboangan\r\ntoward Dapitan. His reputation reached me in a different village, for\r\nin his own they kept him closely concealed, whether it were for the\r\nsake of their ancient observances I do not know. Like a holy man of his\r\nlaw, or because of some fear, he also kept himself hidden; for, as he\r\nafterward told me, they had terrified him by telling him that if the\r\nSpaniards caught him they would put him in the galleys. By that means,\r\nto him whom the pathway of salvation was most easy, they filled it\r\nwith such difficulties that they made it impossible for him. I knew\r\nthat they would refuse to let me see him for those same reasons,\r\nand therefore made use of a trick and of a dangerous resolution,\r\nto catch him. For near the village, which was located on the beach\r\nin the shade of trees (the poverty of these barbarians not suffering\r\nmore shelter), and where in a few hours they would suffer from hunger,\r\nhaving them all before me I told them that if the lavia [71] whom they\r\nhad hidden did not come, then the mass would not begin. Labia is the\r\nname they give to those of this profession. The name of this one was\r\nTuto. I added that no one must return to his house until he arrived,\r\nand that if he delayed too long, I would go to Samboangan with the\r\nchief of the village and the Subanos of importance. That was the same\r\nto them as if I were taking them to the galleys; so much does their\r\nwretchedness grieve to leave the wretchedness in which they were born,\r\nand their lack of intelligence to appear before reasonable people and\r\nSpaniards. Without allowing them to talk, or to question whether he\r\nwas there or not, or where, but assuming that it was a well-known\r\nthing, I turned to a relative of the governor, and said to him:\r\n\"Go for him quickly, for I shall not move from this spot until he\r\ncomes.\" He departed without a word, and all of the people remained\r\nmotionless, staring with fright. When they recovered their equanimity,\r\ntheir whole attempt was to excuse their negligence by empty excuses,\r\nwhich I accepted in order to calm their minds. Inside of an hour\r\nI found in my presence him whom I desired so much. He, seeing the\r\nlove with which I received him, and how differently my purpose was\r\ndeclared from that which his fears gave him to understand, recovered\r\nhis courage in full, and immediately offered himself for baptism--a\r\nmatter which I was unwilling to defer, in order that I might leave\r\nhim with his salvation assured. Consequently, after instructing him\r\nbriefly, I baptized him, and called him Martin, as that happy lot came\r\nto him on that saint's day. [72] He satisfied my hopes and hastened\r\nto me every time when I afterward visited his village of Malande,\r\nvery punctually, and always with some special refreshment both for\r\nme and for him who in my company had acted as his sponsor.\r\n\r\nThe other lavia whom I saw was in one of the Joloan islands,\r\ncalled Pangutara. [73] Him I found to be already a Christian,\r\nwhom Father Alexandro Lopez, a great apostle of the Joloans, had\r\nreduced and baptized in Samboangan, and called Santiago. This man\r\nis naturally very well dispositioned and has no moral defects, and\r\nhe is a man of a celestial peace and serenity. He is always bubbling\r\nwith laughter, which is the effect of the security of his soul; for,\r\nwhen the conscience has nothing to fear, the heart has gladness to\r\nscatter abroad.\r\n\r\nI must not neglect to tell one thing that I noticed in regard to the\r\nnature of the people of this profession, from what I could gather\r\nfrom the exterior of those two, which seems to me to be the reason\r\nthat takes them along the pathway so unusual and difficult in a\r\nclimate so hot, and lands so dangerous (as he who has had experience\r\nin these islands, and who knows the wretchedness of their natives\r\nin this region, will know). For the physiognomy of those men is that\r\nof eunuchs, and their natural disposition and condition are so cold,\r\nthat it made me think that they must be so naturally, and that nature\r\nkept her virtue under control in this region. But since they behave\r\nin all other things with so blameless a life, I shall always consider\r\nthem as prodigies of the divine Providence in favor of virtue. For\r\nno one despises virtue as a thing unknown, since even to barbarians\r\nvirtue is painted in so natural colors that they respect it naturally,\r\nwithout more external credit than their native security.\r\n\r\nThis sole spark of good morals have I found among the so great darkness\r\nin which the Subanos live. However, they have another custom belonging\r\nto the same aspect of their lives, so vile that it is sufficient\r\nto obscure greater lights than those of that small spark; for among\r\nthem is more acceptable the exchange that they make of their women\r\nwith one another--the husbands mutually agreeing upon this exchange,\r\nand celebrating the hideous loan and the vile restitution with dances\r\nand drunken revels, according to their custom. Their feasts are like\r\ntheir customs, and one is the manifestation of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n    Burials and marriages of those natives\r\n\r\n\r\nI have kept these two acts, so contrary in their effects, in order\r\nto present them in one place in this chapter, inasmuch as they are\r\nof greater display and magnificence, and in them, in spite of the\r\nsimplicity of those natives, the serious predominates. In the first,\r\nwhich is practiced with their dead, I know not whether to praise\r\nmore their piety or their generosity and grandeur, or to which of the\r\ntwo virtues recognition is due; for both are carried to the greatest\r\nextreme. For their liberality, the obligations of their piety (which\r\ndeclares itself in those attentions a debtor to nature), passes by\r\nand tramples under foot the laws of their poverty and the natural\r\nsimplicity of these Indians, and makes demonstrations superior to\r\ntheir fortune, clothing their dead with the magnificence of princes. In\r\nthe shroud alone, they clothe the dead person in a hundred brazas of\r\nfine muslin, which serves him as a shirt. Over that they place rich\r\npatolas, which are pieces of cloth of gold, or of silk alone, worked\r\nvery beautifully, and of great value, pious generosity endeavoring to\r\ngive him the best and to clothe him in the finest and most precious\r\ngarments. It is a law, established by immemorial custom, that the\r\nchildren and near relatives each clothe the deceased in a piece of\r\ngauze or of sinampuli (another fabric of equal estimation) arranging it\r\nwith such loops and knots that they find space for it all. In regard\r\nto the dress, this custom is in force even to this day, and no man\r\nwho respects himself has ever failed in this law. There is no one so\r\npoor and so wretched that he does not own a piece [of cloth] eight\r\nbrazas long, which is reserved for his burial. They have abandoned\r\nother demonstrations, or rather, exchanged them for Christian ones,\r\nof which we shall speak at the proper place. In that regard they give\r\noldtime Christians much to emulate. For formerly they buried with\r\ntheir dead most of their treasures--gold, bells, and other things,\r\nwhich are highly esteemed among them. Those things were so sacred to\r\nreverence that no one, however abandoned and audacious he might be,\r\nhad the courage to stretch forth his hand to take them--although\r\nhe could have done so with great safety to himself, as their dead\r\nare buried in caves, islets, or solitary mountains, without other\r\nguard than their imaginary religion. On the day on which they buried\r\nthe deceased, about his sepulcher they planted palms, jasmines, and\r\nother flowers peculiar to this region. If the deceased was a king,\r\nor a prince of equal nobility, they placed a tent above the grave with\r\nfour white banners at its sides, while inside it they burned perfumes\r\nas long as the time of lamentation or memorial lasted, perhaps setting\r\naside some slaves for that employ, in order to make it more lasting.\r\n\r\nThis heathen display has given way to Christian demonstrations of\r\nsumptuous honors and abundant alms which they give for their deceased,\r\nas we shall relate in the proper place. But I shall not defer the\r\ntelling of one which may prove a matter of reprehension to our neglect\r\nand forgetfulness, in what is more important to us, namely, that they\r\nare wont to have the coffin prepared during the lifetime for their\r\nburial. They make those coffins out of one single piece, and from\r\nincorruptible woods. They keep them under their houses where they\r\ncan see them whenever they descend from or ascend to their houses;\r\nand they are open to the gaze of all who pass along the street. That\r\nis a care that it would be right for them to have learned from the\r\noldtime Christians, whom the faith of what they hope for, ought to\r\narouse with greater demonstrations....\r\n\r\nThe Subanos follow the Lutaos in some things, their poverty and misery\r\nexerting efforts in the worship of their dead, and their barbarism\r\nshowing itself at the side of their piety, when they throw into the\r\nsea, out of grief, the gold of their ornaments, decorations, and\r\ntheir most precious jewels--a custom wellnigh universal in all these\r\nislands. [74] But in one island their cruelty is shown especially\r\nin their alleviation of their grief and their barbaric pity for\r\ntheir calamity, by giving associates to the deceased, and making\r\nthem companions of their grief, causing the same havoc and loss in\r\nothers. Because their father, son, near relative, or anyone whom they\r\nhad loved had died, they would seize their arms in order to kill the\r\nfirst person whom they met, and without other cause for offense than\r\nthat of their natural disposition and their barbaric ferocity. Thus\r\nwith the blood of the unfortunate one did they dry the tears of their\r\nown ill fortune, finding consolation in the misfortune of others.\r\n\r\nThe celebration at their marriages is such that in all that has been\r\ndiscovered nothing else can compare with it; and the Spaniards who\r\ndaily wonder at it as witnesses always do so with new wonder. For if\r\nthe marriage is of a chief, the celebration begins a week beforehand,\r\nand is concluded a week after with dancing to the sound of their bells\r\nand drums. There is open table for all who care to go up into the\r\nhouse. The viands consist of wine, for that is the thing in which they\r\nare especially solicitous to show display, while they take no account\r\nof the food, although it is not lacking. But the deceiving heat of\r\nthe wine takes away their taste so strongly that they are mindful of\r\nnothing. Its heat serves to give spirit and animation to their songs\r\n(which are in honor of him who makes the feast), and sprightliness\r\nto their dances. The day of the celebration [of the wedding] when\r\nthe betrothed couple have to appear for the nuptial blessings, the\r\nbride, breaking the strict confinement which she keeps all that time,\r\nissues forth with a display and gravity superior to her condition;\r\nfor her relatives and the other Indians of their partisanship are clad\r\nin their gala costume, and armed with lance and shield, and escort the\r\nbride. The march is to the accompaniment of bells and Moorish dulzainas\r\n[i.e., a sort of wind instrument]. The ladies of honor follow in double\r\nfile, and they generally consist of all the women of the village,\r\nwho are invited for the sake of greater display of grandeur. Then\r\nthe girls follow in the same order, while those of greater social\r\nstanding and higher rank are borne in chairs richly adorned, and\r\ncarried on the shoulders of four slaves. At the end comes the bride\r\nin a certain very spacious chair which allows room for a lady who\r\nsupports and assists her, and to two or three girls, who serve her\r\nwith so singular modesty and gravity that it would cause wonder even\r\nif she did not affect so great elaborateness; for she scarcely moves\r\nan eyelash or must move her hand, those who accompany her substituting\r\nthemselves for everything. One dries the sweat from her, another fans\r\nher, and a third looks after her clothing. Down a different street\r\ncomes the bridegroom to meet the bride, with a like or even greater\r\nretinue in competition with that of the relatives of the bride. The\r\nmen are in gala costume, and armed; the women are in festal array;\r\nand the chief women in chairs. The dress of the bridal pair must be\r\nwhite, until, the [bride's] consent having been given, the bridegroom\r\nretires, and exchanges it for a red dress. In this ceremony coquetry\r\ndisplays greater affectations: for the bride takes a half-hour to give\r\nher answer, and, after it is given she wastes another long half-hour\r\nto reach the lattice of the chapel. And it is necessary to sit down\r\nto await the bride for that time, amid the laughter of those who a\r\nfew days before saw her running and leaping about like a mad she-goat,\r\nwhile on this day she deports herself with so great a demonstration of\r\nsedateness and virginal modesty. The precision of her steps, they say,\r\nis a necessity, because she is coming bound even to the feet. That\r\nis the ceremony that they practice for the reception of the husband\r\nwho is the one who must come to take those bonds and shackles from her.\r\n\r\nOn that day the house is all hung with a canopy that covers everything,\r\nso that neither walls nor ceiling are seen. The bridal-chamber is\r\nopen to the sight and richly adorned, for on that day everything\r\ngleams with splendor and adornment. The bride is seated on a cushion,\r\nnear a seat made for the groom from cushions in the Moorish style,\r\nwith embroidery and strips of silk with a quantity of lace. She is\r\nserved with the same ostentation as in the street, and displays no\r\nmore animation than a statue. I was present at one of so great display\r\nthat, besides the display which the Lutaos showed in their weddings,\r\nthere came at two o'clock of the same day, marching in a company\r\nformed of their men, lancers and arquebusiers, an assembly of men who\r\ntaking position in the plaza de armas, invited the governor and all\r\nthe Spanish artillery for that afternoon; and for the following day\r\nall the paid soldiers--Pampangos and Cagayanes--giving food to all and\r\nserving the Spaniards quite in the Spanish fashion, both in the cuisine\r\nand in the courtesies. It is an event of so great preëminence that the\r\ngovernor and all his captains and best soldiers go to it, in order to\r\nhonor and conciliate those people. And any prince can well go to see\r\nthose ceremonies, for neither actions nor words show that they are\r\nbarbarians; but [they appear as] the most modest nation in the world,\r\nwhich is celebrating its marriage without any idea of the [carnal]\r\ndelights of it. They are so moderate in showing their affection that\r\nduring three days they do not avail themselves of the license of their\r\nestate. Such is the way in which they act that the fathers worthily\r\nhonor it with their presence, and on that day go to their houses,\r\nfor they are unaccustomed to the modesty and caution unless it is\r\nwhen they confess and anoint them. Everything is dispensed with on\r\nthat day because of its gravity. We all, then, went on that day with\r\nthe superior, and the governor and captains. I was very glad to be a\r\nwitness of so great splendor, modesty, and gravity in natives who are\r\nin other things so simple and unceremonious; and to see a sacrament so\r\nhazardous treated with so much devotion, in the respect shown to the\r\nministers of it. That chief spent at that feast more than four hundred\r\narrobas of wine, and more than one thousand birds. Although they are\r\npoor, in order to meet the obligations of that day satisfactorily they\r\nstrip themselves, showing an equally generous spirit in such action\r\nwith the living as is displayed in the fatherland with the dead; for\r\nthe greatest displays of their grandeur are the funerals and weddings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n    Boats and weapons of these natives\r\n\r\n\r\nThe craft used by the Lutaos for war are, like those of terrible\r\npirates, built with particular attention to speed--both for pursuit,\r\nand to seek shelter whenever affairs go wrong with them, or when\r\ntheir undertaking is dangerous to them. For since their wars are\r\nalways waged for greed, and reputation never induces them, they try to\r\nadvantage themselves quite at their safety; and they readily abandon\r\nany undertaking if they see that it will be costly to them. That care\r\nand attention, which govern their boat-building, cause their ships to\r\nsail like birds, while ours are like lead in this regard. The planking\r\nthat they use is very thin, and has no other nails, crotches, or knees\r\nthan a little rattan. Rattan is the substance which here takes the\r\nplace of hemp, in tying things together, some planks [in the craft]\r\nbeing tied together with it. For that purpose projecting parts are\r\nleft at intervals on the inside [of the planks] in which holes are\r\nmade; and through these the ligament passes, without any harm being\r\ndone to the plank. Upon so light a foundation they build upper works,\r\nas high as they wish, of bamboo upon the cates. The cates are buoys\r\nwhich run on both sides from bow to stern, and they act as outriggers\r\nfor the ship, which is sustained by these two floats. The ship carries\r\nmore outside than in. The outside scaffolds allow room for two rows\r\nof oars, beside that of the hull. Thus small craft of from seven to\r\ntwelve brazas (which is the largest size) have a crew of sixty men and\r\nupwards. I have seen one that was manned with three hundred hands;\r\nfor, in order to have the rowing more compressed together they use\r\nloose oars, each one handling his own. Those oars are certain round\r\nblades, which an Indian manages easily. Therefore, when it is necessary\r\nthey row exactly to the time of their breathing, by inserting more\r\nor less of the oar, according to the force they wish to give. For\r\nthe rowing is excellent and the oar is put directly into the water,\r\nbecause it is trusted solely to the hands, without being fastened\r\nto anything. That is a custom that obliges them to have their craft\r\nvery flat, and to elevate the sides but little, and they are content\r\nto leave but one plank out of the water.\r\n\r\nThese vessels are crescent-shaped. Consequently, there is but a small\r\nkeel, or little of it in the water, and that part which they rob from\r\nstern and bow is left out of the water--three or four brazas of keel\r\nor stem, all of which serves for its speed, and there is little to\r\nhold the boat back because of its narrowness. Therefore the helm\r\nis not managed like the Spanish helm, by the sweep from the end;\r\naccordingly, they use two rudders, one at one side and one at the\r\nother, where the flat part of the keel begins. One is usually employed\r\nfor managing the boat, and both of them when it is stormy. With the\r\nsecond they keep the boat from getting unsteady, which would follow\r\nfrom its lightness, that rudder giving the boat more stiffness and\r\nserving as ballast. That is a precaution rendered necessary by its\r\nvery lightness, the vessels that are lightest being those that require\r\nmost care by being unsteady. In the middle they have a scaffold, four\r\nor six brazas long, which they call burulan or baileo. This consists\r\nof a floor raised above the rowers, and has its awning, which is\r\ncalled cayanes. Those awnings are made from the leaves of a small\r\npalm which grows in the water. That is the quarters for the fighters\r\nand the chiefs, for those vessels do not have any stern-cabin; it is,\r\nat the same time, the little castle from which they fight. All that\r\nstructure finds its support and staunchness in what they call the\r\ncates, which are the buoys of which we have spoken. They are made of\r\nthree or four bamboos as thick as the arm, and even larger, and reach\r\nfrom stem to stern. They are so adjusted that they drag through the\r\nwater about one and one-half brazas away from the vessel. Consequently,\r\nthey do not allow it to toss about, however violent the waves, but\r\nare the arms that keep the boat safe. They are used in general by\r\nall the craft of these islands, and by those of Burney and Maluco;\r\nfor, since their ships are of no account without this security, they\r\nhave no safety in the sea nor do the Indians dare to embark. From\r\nthis circumstance Molina, who represented to the Council that buoys\r\nought to be fastened to the ships so that they could sail or float\r\nwith a support made of certain bags blown up and thrown alongside,\r\nderived his argument. He thought that that would assure the fleets,\r\nas they could not then sink, as he had experienced, even if they\r\nfilled with water. It might have proved successful indeed, and in\r\nfavor of his discourse, if some heavy sea raised by the hurricanes\r\nwould not prove sufficient to burst the bags and drag them away from\r\nthe sides; for hurricanes have more than sufficient violence to break\r\nup the stern and destroy the ship. That has been well known by actual\r\nexperience here; for a few hours of a severe storm are sufficient to\r\ndestroy the fastenings; and those ships would be wrecked daily if the\r\nvoyages were not so short, and the vessels of so small burden that they\r\ncan find shelter in any port. When necessity arises, the men in them\r\nbeach the vessels themselves, and do so more easily when they go in\r\na fleet, as then they unite their forces. The crossings are so short,\r\nbecause of the multiplicity of islands, that the weather never catches\r\nthem in such a way that they can not soon escape by drawing near to\r\none land or another. For fair weather this appliance is very useful,\r\nso that they take comfort in them freely.\r\n\r\nIn regard to their weapons, the Lutao nation is the most curious in\r\nthese islands; for all glory in having the most precious and the finest\r\narms possible. All of them from their earliest age wear their weapons,\r\nwith so careful a regard to this matter that no one dares to leave\r\nhis house without his weapons. The wearing of weapons is so much a\r\nmatter of reputation with them, that they consider it an insult to be\r\nobliged to appear without them, regulating their punctiliousness in\r\nthis region very much according to the laws of España. It casts much\r\nshame upon the negligence into which our military force has fallen,\r\nby the poor reputation of those here who profess arms, who in the\r\nsight of these nations are not ashamed to be seen without swords or\r\ndaggers; and those which they carry well demonstrate the care with\r\nwhich they serve in their posts, since they necessarily satisfy outward\r\nappearance, although they would be useless on occasion. I speak of\r\nthe simple and common soldiers; and, since this care is lacking in\r\nmost of them, it ought to be felt more, and with effect, by those who\r\ncan remedy it. The weapon worn by the natives of the cities is a wavy\r\ndagger, which they call a kris. Its blade is engraved with channels\r\nand water-lines, which make it very beautiful. The hilt is a small\r\nidol, made of ivory for the common man, and of gold for the chiefs,\r\nstudded with gems which are highly esteemed among them. I saw one worn\r\nby the commander Socsocan [75]--who was the lord of Samboangan when\r\nour men conquered it--which was valued at ten slaves. The scabbard\r\nwas gilded with the same neatness, and at some time had been covered\r\nwith sheets of gold. I saw a scabbard in Joló, which had a pearl as\r\nlarge as a musket-ball at the end of the chape. The blades are very\r\nfine, and, although so small (being scarcely two palmos in length),\r\nthey are valued at twelve, twenty, or thirty reals of eight.\r\n\r\nSuch are their arms in peace; those of war, for fighting on the land,\r\nare lances and shields. The shield is round among the coast-dwellers\r\nof the south, and in the islands of Basilan and Joló. In the rest of\r\nthis island, the general custom of the long and narrow shield which\r\nis used in all the other islands is followed; with these, they shield\r\nand protect all the body. From these weapons the kris is inseparable,\r\nand they use it at close quarters, and after they have used the lance,\r\nwhich they throw in the usual manner. Their lances show the same care\r\nas their krises, and are very much ornamented and engraved, and have\r\ntheir covers gilded. The shaft is of the finest ebony, or of some\r\nother beautiful wood; and at intervals they put rings of silver or\r\ntin on it. The head is of brass, which is used here, and so highly\r\npolished that it vies with gold. It is chased so elaborately that\r\nthere are lances that are valued at one slave each. At the end they\r\nfasten a large hawk's-bell, which they fix upon the shaft in such a\r\nmanner that it surrounds it; and when they shake the lance it sounds\r\nin time with the fierce threats and bravadoes. The valiant use them\r\nand as man-slayers, give warning to those who do not know them and\r\nthose of less valor, so that they may avoid them as they would vipers.\r\n\r\nThe arms used on sea and land--besides those of the plain, in places\r\nwhere the people fortify themselves with the resolve to defend\r\nthemselves--in addition to the one mentioned (which are the most\r\ndeadly), are the bagacayes, which are certain small bamboos as thick as\r\nthe finger, hardened in the fire and with points sharpened. They throw\r\nthese with such skill that they never miss when the object is within\r\nrange; and some men throw them five at a time. Although it is so weak\r\na weapon, it has such violence that it has gone through a boat and\r\nhas pierced and killed the rower. Brother Diego de Santiago told me,\r\nas an eyewitness, that he being seated saw that thing (which appears\r\na prodigy) happen in the same vessel in which he had embarked with a\r\ngarrison. To me that seemed so incredible that I wished immediately to\r\nsee it myself; and, cutting a bagacay, I had it thrown at a shield. In\r\nSamboanga I saw a bull which was killed immediately by a bagacay\r\nwhich a lad threw at it, which struck it clear to the heart. It is a\r\nthing that would cause laughter in Europa, and there would be little\r\nesteem for the valor which does not despise such weapons, and they\r\nwould jest at so frail violence. But it is certain that, at close\r\nrange, there is no crueler weapon; and it is also certain that, the\r\nday on which these Moros have bravery enough to get within range,\r\non that day any ship must yield. For they send in such a shower of\r\nthese bagacayes that scarce a man is unwounded; while many are stuck\r\nlike bulls, so that they cannot move for being laden with so many\r\nweapons. Then the rowing ceases, and they discharge the missiles with\r\nboth hands and some from each finger, both rowers and fighters. That\r\nthrows their opponents into disorder, and they are unable to manage\r\ntheir weapons. There must be many in España who were in the dangerous\r\nsieges which Governor Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera undertook\r\nagainst the kings of both Mindanao and Joló--where, in the so great\r\nmortality which the glorious boldness and military honor of our men\r\nincurred, the most of those who fell, to exalt their fame forever,\r\nwere slain by arms so weak and apparently contemptible. In the same\r\nway they use stakes hardened in the fire which they hurl with accuracy,\r\nand which inflict even more damage. The lance is used in the same way,\r\nand they hurl it with so extraordinary violence that they pierce a\r\nsteel-covered shield and transfix the soldier with it, as has been\r\nseen often. In an engagement that Captain Gaspar de Morales [76]\r\nfought in Joló, his steel-covered shield did not avail him; but the\r\nlance passed through it and his arm, and did not fall short of giving\r\nhim a mortal wound in the breast.\r\n\r\nThe Negrillos of this island use the bow and arrow, as these are\r\nthe weapons least difficult to obtain, and more natural [to them], as\r\nrequiring less skill. They poison arrows, and the wound is consequently\r\nalways dangerous. The wooden points of the arrows are so hard that\r\nthose people have no occasion to regret the lack of iron. [77]\r\n\r\nThe use of the blowpipe [zarbatana], which is one braza long, has\r\nextended from the Borneans to the Joloans, and even to the Lutaos of\r\nthis island. By blowing through it they discharge certain small darts\r\nsmeared with so deadly a poison that if one single drop of blood is\r\ndrawn, death is certain to result, if the antidote is not quickly\r\napplied. When our soldiers have to make an expedition to Burney,\r\nwhere other weapons are rarely used, they go prepared with the most\r\nefficacious antidotes--namely, human excrement, as has always been\r\nhappily experienced. These blowpipes are sometimes used also as lances,\r\nhaving the iron fastened at one side, so that, if the shot is not\r\naccurate, they use it alternately as a lance. Then when the opportunity\r\nis offered they make use of their darts. They are so good shots that\r\nthey can bring down the smallest bird at twenty or thirty paces.\r\n\r\nThe Joloans who are called Ximbanaos, [78] and are more ferocious\r\nand of greater determination, are armed from top to toe with helmet,\r\nbracelets, coat-of-mail, greaves, with linings of elephant-hide--armor\r\nso proof that nothing can make a dint on it except firearms, for the\r\nbest sword or cutlass is turned. That was an experience acquired by\r\nmany in the conquest of the Joloans by General Don Pedro de Almonte\r\nVerastigui, [79] who had brought from Ternate braggarts of that nation,\r\nwho wielded the campilan or cutlass--a weapon made for cutting off\r\nheads, and for splitting the body from top to toe. But they could\r\neffect nothing, notwithstanding the heavy blows of those cutlasses;\r\nand retired like cowards, giving as an excuse that their weapons\r\nwould not cut, and that they were only succeeding in ruining them,\r\nfor they were all nicked by the strong resistance. From the shoulders\r\nrise two irons to the height of the helmet and morion by which they\r\nprotect the head from being cut off. They knot the flaps of their\r\nskirts on the breast or coat-of-mail, so that they can bend the knee\r\nto the ground, according to their method of fighting, when the case\r\ndemands it. They wear a plume of feathers above the forehead, such as\r\nis seen on mules. They leave nothing unarmed, even to the eyes, which\r\nare armed by fierceness--both because of the terrific appearance of\r\ntheir arms, and by the fierceness which they affect. It is the fitting\r\ndress, among them, for princes and braggarts. When they put it on they\r\ngenerally take some opium, [80] and, rendered furious and insensible\r\n[to danger] by it, they enter amid the vessels of a squadron madly,\r\nand destroy it with great slaughter. For their arms are lance, kris,\r\nor dagger; and with their bounds and leaps, in which they indulge\r\naccording to their barbarous method of fighting, they appear in many\r\nplaces, always endeavoring to bring down many [of their foes]. Hence,\r\nin order that any ball may strike them, it is necessary that it\r\ncause disaster in the troop--besides the injuries that their fury\r\nhas executed in safety, armed so proof against those who dress as\r\nlightly as the heat and roughness of the country compel.\r\n\r\nThe Mindanaos use a weapon quite distinct from that of the\r\nTernatans. It is a campilan or cutlass of one edge, and heavier\r\nthan the pointless Turkish weapon. It is a very bloody weapon, but,\r\nbeing so heavy, it is a danger for him who handles it, if he is not\r\nadroit with it. It has only two forms of use, namely, to wield it\r\nby one edge, and to raise it by the other, in order to deal another\r\nstroke, its weight allowing time for the spears of the opponents to\r\nenter. They do not gird it on, as that would be too much trouble,\r\nbut carry it on the shoulders, in the fashion of the camarlengos\r\n[81] who carry the rapiers on their shoulders in public ceremonies in\r\nfront of their princes. Besides that weapon the Mindanao uses lance,\r\nkris, and shield, as do the other nations. Both these and those have\r\nbegun to use firearms too much, having acquired that from intercourse\r\nwith our enemies. They manage all sorts of artillery excellently, and\r\nin their fleets all their craft carry their own pieces, with ladle,\r\nculverins, esmerils, and other small weapons. [82]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN AGUSTIN'S LETTER ON THE FILIPINOS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., wrote the following letter regarding\r\nthe Filipinos. This letter has been widely discussed pro and con\r\nby various writers, because of the views expressed therein. Many\r\nmanuscript copies of it exist in various collections, archives, and\r\nlibraries. The present translation is made from an early manuscript\r\ncopy, belonging to Mr. E. E. Ayer, of Chicago. In footnotes we give\r\nthe variant readings of the MS. conserved in the Museo-Biblioteca de\r\nUltramar, Madrid (pressmark \"6-5a; caja 17; 21-4a\"), that MS. being\r\nindicated in our notes by the letter M.; and of the letter as published\r\nin Delgado's [83] Historia (pp. 273-296, where it shows marks of\r\nhaving been edited by either Delgado or his editor), that publication\r\nbeing indicated by the letter D. Sinibaldo de Mas presents many of the\r\nessential parts of the letter in his Informe de las Islas Filipinas\r\nen 1842, i, \"Poblacion,\" pp. 63-132. He says: \"In order to give an\r\nidea of their physical and moral qualities, I am going to insert some\r\nparagraphs from a letter of Father Gaspar de San Augustin of the year\r\n1725, [84] suppressing many Latin citations from the holy fathers\r\nwhich weigh that letter down, and adding some observations from my\r\nown harvest, when I think them opportune.\" We shall use most of these\r\nobservations in the annotations herewith presented. Sir John Bowring\r\ngives, on pp. 125-139 of his Visit to the Philippine Isles (London,\r\n1859) some excerpts taken from Mas's Informe, but he has sadly mixed\r\nSan Agustin's and Mas's matter, and has ascribed some of the latter's\r\nobservations to San Agustin, besides making other errors. [85]]\r\n\r\nLetter from fray Gaspar de San Agustin to a friend in España who\r\nasked him as to the nature and characteristics [genio] of the Indian\r\nnatives of these Philipinas Islands. [86]\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nAlthough your command has so great weight with me, the undertaking of\r\nperforming it satisfactorily is so difficult that I doubt my ability\r\nto fulfil what you ask. It would be more easy for me, I believe, to\r\ndefine the formal object of logic; to give the square of a circle; to\r\nfind the mathematical [side [87]] of the double of the cube and sphere,\r\nor to find a fixed rule for the measurement of the degrees of longitude\r\nof the terrestrial sphere; than to define the nature of the Indians,\r\nand their customs and vices. This is a memorandum-book in which I have\r\nemployed myself for forty years, and I shall only say: Quadraginta\r\nannis proximus fui generationi huic, et dixi semper hi errant corde;\r\n[88] and I believe that Solomon himself would place this point of\r\nknowledge after the four things impossible to his understanding which\r\nhe gives in chapter XXX, verse 18 of Proverbs. Only can they tell the\r\nOne who knows them by pointing to the sky and saying, Ipse cognovit\r\nfigmentum nostrum. [89] But in order that you may not say to me that I\r\nam thus ridding myself of the burden of the difficulty, [90] without\r\nmaking any effort or showing any obedience, I shall relate briefly\r\nwhat I have observed, for it would be impossible to write everything,\r\nif one were to use all the paper that is found in China.\r\n\r\n2. The knowledge of men has been considered by the most erudite persons\r\nas a difficult thing. Dificile est, noscere hominem animal varium et\r\nversipelle. [91] Man is a changeable theater of transformations. The\r\ninconstancies of his ages resemble the variation of the year. A\r\ngreat knowledge of man did that blind man of the eighth chapter of\r\nSt. Mark have who said, with miraculous sight, that he saw men as\r\ntrees: Video homines velut arbores ambulantes. [92] For the tree in\r\nthe four seasons of the year has its changes as has man in his four\r\nages; and thus said the English poet Oven:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Ver viridem flavamque æstas, me fervida canam\r\n    Autumnus calvam, frigida fecit hyems.\" [93]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For this is the inconstancy of man in his [various] ages: green in\r\nhis childhood; fiery in the age of his virility; white in old age; and\r\nbald in his decrepitude.\" But his greatest change is in his customs,\r\nfor he is a continual Proteus, and an inconstant Vertumnus. [94]\r\nThus does Martial paint his friend:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Dificilis, facilis, jucundus, acerbus est idem;\r\n    Nec tecum possum vivere, nec sine te.\" [95]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this came the proverb \"Quot capita, tot sententiæ.\" [96] For\r\nin the changeable affection of man are locked up all the meteoric\r\ninfluences of natural transformations.\r\n\r\n3. It is a fact that the difficulty of knowing these Indians is not\r\nin the individuals, but in the race; for, if one be known, then all\r\nare known, without any distinction--so much so that the Greek word\r\nmonopantos [97] fits them, and which another critic gave to another\r\nrace of people, because they were all homogeneous and uniform among\r\nthemselves. At the eighth meeting of the last Lateran Council, held\r\nin the time of Leo X, the opinion of the Monophysite philosophers\r\n[98]--who give but one single soul to all men, each body having a part\r\nof it--was condemned. Doubtless that impious opinion originated from\r\nsome nation as alike in customs as these Indians; and it is not the\r\nworst thing to have been able to give this humble judgment, although\r\nit is defective. [99]\r\n\r\n4. Although we call both the natives of America and those of these\r\nPhilipinas Islands Indians, it cannot be denied that they are very\r\ndifferent; for the inclination of the Asiatics [100] is somewhat more\r\ndocile and more capable of progress through teaching. Accordingly,\r\nI shall confine my remarks to the Indians of Philipinas, leaving\r\nthe definition of the Americans for those who know them; for they\r\nhave enough chroniclers who have undertaken it, although I doubt\r\nthat they obtained their desire, such as Father Juan de Torquemada\r\nin his Monarchia Indiana, [101] Fray Antonio de Remesal, [102] and\r\nFather Joseph de Acosta. [103] For what has been written of them by\r\nthe bishop of Chiapa, Fray Bernardino de Cassas, [104] and by Don\r\nJuan de Palafox [105] in his treatise on the virtues of the Indians,\r\nwas written from very remote experience; and they were carried away\r\nby the holy zeal of their defense as they were deceived [106] by\r\ntheir remote knowledge of the object--as [in viewing] the hills and\r\nmountains, which anear are green, but afar are blue. Gold conceals\r\nfrom the sight the degree of its fineness; and one must crush [107]\r\nthe rock himself, and frequently, in order to recognize the truth.\r\n\r\n5. The Asiatic Indians of Philipinas, then, are almost the same as\r\nthose of the other nations of East India, in what regards their genius\r\n[genio], temper, and disposition. Consequently, the Malays, Siamese,\r\nMogoles, and Canarines [108] are distinguished only by their clothing,\r\nlanguages and ceremonies. I except the Japanese (who are, as Gracian\r\n[109] learnedly remarked, the Spaniards of Asia) and the Chinese,\r\nwho, by their culture and civilization, and love of letters, seem to\r\nbe different--although, touched with the stone of experience, they\r\nare the same as the Indians. [110] The influence of the stars which\r\nrule Assia is common, whence Macrobius and Suetonius complain that\r\nthe corruption of the good native customs of the Romans proceeded,\r\nespecially from Persia, whence came great evil both to the Greeks\r\nand to the Latins.\r\n\r\n6. But leaving this immense sea of peoples and customs, let us return\r\nto our natives of these islands, who, besides having been exceedingly\r\nbarbarous, living without a ruler, and in a confused monarchy, [111]\r\nhave the vices of the islanders; for they are fickle, false, and\r\nmendacious, and [that] by the special influence and dominion which\r\nthe moon exercises upon all the islands, isthmuses, and peninsulas\r\n[Chersonesos], of which much will be found in the Theatrum vitæ humanæ\r\nof Laurencio Beyerlinch. [112]\r\n\r\n7. The temperament of these Indians, as is proved by their physiognomy,\r\nis cold and humid, because of the great influence of the moon. They\r\nhave but little or no difference among themselves in their temperament,\r\nas was remarked by a learned doctor who has had considerable experience\r\nin these islands, namely, Doctor Blas Nuñez de Prado. [He observed]\r\nthat there was no difference, but a great similarity, in the humors of\r\nthose who had been treated, and a fine natural docility in responding\r\nto the medicine; in whatever remedy it was applied to them. For\r\nthey have not the great rebelliousness and changeableness of the\r\nEuropeans, because of the infinite combinations made in them by the\r\nfour humors. The cause of this is the similarity and lack of variety\r\nin the food that they use and which their ancestors used, which go\r\nto make up a nature different in its root from that of the Europeans,\r\nbut yet very similar. [113]\r\n\r\n8. This disposition and influence makes them fickle, malicious,\r\nuntrustworthy, dull, and lazy; [114] fond of traveling by river,\r\nsea, and lake; fond of fishing, and ichthyophagous [115]--that is,\r\nthey sustain themselves best on fish; they have little courage, on\r\naccount of their cold nature, and are not disposed to work. [116]\r\nBesides this they have other qualities and vices, of which I do not\r\nknow the cause, and I do not believe that I can easily know them. [117]\r\nI shall mention some of them. [118]\r\n\r\n9. First, they are remarkable for their ingratitude; and although\r\ningratitude is an innate vice in all people, through the corruption\r\nof original sin in our vitiated nature, it is not corrected in them\r\nby the understanding, and they lack magnanimity. Therefore, it is all\r\none to do a good turn to an Indian, and to prepare oneself to receive\r\nthe blow of his ingratitude. Consequently, if one lend them money,\r\nthey do not pay it; but instead they run away from the father. Hence\r\nthere is ground for scruples in regard to lending money to them;\r\nfor that is a benefit from which evil must result, as they absent\r\nthemselves and do not come to mass. If others ask them why, they\r\nanswer that the father [119] is angry at them. In them is verified\r\nthe picture given by the Holy Spirit in chapter xxix, verse[s] 4[-9]\r\nof Ecclesiasticus. \"Many\" (he says) \"have thought by artifice to\r\nsatisfy the thing due, and have given trouble to those who have aided\r\nthem. So long as they receive, they kiss the hands of him who gives,\r\nand humble themselves with promises. But when it comes time to pay,\r\nthey will beg for time (for they are beggars and not givers); and\r\nthey will utter tedious and complaining words, and the time is spent\r\nin vain. Even though one can pay, he can be got to do so only with\r\ngreat difficulty. For one solidus [120] scarcely will he give the\r\nhalf, and that he will think an unjust artifice; and if he cannot\r\npay he will keep the money, and will esteem the debtor as an enemy\r\ncauselessly, and will return him insults and evil words, and for\r\nhonor and kindness will return him dishonor.\" [121] This picture of\r\ningratitude given by Ecclesiasticus fits many, but it fits the Indians\r\nbetter than all other nations, except the Vix solidi reddet dimidium,\r\n[122] for they pay nothing. This is one of the evil signs that the\r\nroyal prophet finds in the evil and ingrate in Psalm xxxvi, verse 21:\r\n\"The sinner shall take the loan, and shall not pay.\" [123] Consequently\r\nwe find our Indians pagans in this, although they are Christians. [124]\r\n\r\n10. If they borrow anything that is not money, they will never return\r\nit until it is requested; and, as an excuse for not having returned\r\nit, they say that they have not been asked for it. [125]\r\n\r\n11. Their laziness is such that if they open a door they never close\r\nit; and if they take any implement for any use, such as a knife, pair\r\nof scissors, hammer, etc., they never return it whence they took it,\r\nbut drop it there at the foot of the work. [126]\r\n\r\n12. If they are paid anything in advance, they will leave work and\r\nkeep the pay. [127]\r\n\r\n13. They are naturally rude, and consequently, it is strange to\r\nsee them, when talking with the father or a Spaniard, first scratch\r\nthemselves on the temples, [128] and, if it be a woman, on the thigh;\r\nbut the more polished scratch themselves on the head. [129]\r\n\r\n14. It is a thing of great wonder that in everything they make in\r\nwhich there is a right and wrong side, they naturally make it wrong\r\nside out. Consequently, they have not thus far been able to give in\r\nto difficulty of folding a cloak with its right side in; [130] nor\r\n[do they understand] it can be that when a shirt or habit is wrong\r\nside out, on putting the head in, it is given a turn and remains\r\nright side out. Consequently, whenever they see this done, they\r\nexpress more surprise. [131] Hence the remark of a discerning man,\r\nthat all they did was wrong except folding a cloak, because in that\r\noperation the wrong side is the face or right side. [132]\r\n\r\n15. When the men walk with their wives, they go in advance, and the\r\nwives follow, as that is just the contrary of our custom. This was a\r\nbit of carelessness that cost Orpheus the loss of his wife, who was\r\nstolen by the prince Auresteo, as we are told in mythology. [133]\r\n\r\n16. They are curious, rude, and impertinent, and accordingly, when\r\nthey meet the father they generally ask him where he is going and\r\nwhence he is coming; and innumerable questions, all impertinent and\r\ntroublesome. [134]\r\n\r\nIf any letter is read before them, they will go behind one to see it,\r\nalthough they do [not] know how to read. And if they hear any talking\r\nin private, they draw nigh to listen to it, even though it be in a\r\nlanguage that they do not understand.\r\n\r\n17. They enter, without being summoned, into the convents and the\r\nhouses of the Spaniards, even into the most secret apartment, but in\r\ntheir own houses they practice many civilities. If the door be locked,\r\nthey try with might and main to look through the cracks at what is\r\nbeing done, for they wish to know everything. [135]\r\n\r\nThey tramp about in the convents and houses of the Spaniards so loudly,\r\nthat it causes wonder and annoyance; and especially if the father\r\nis asleep. In their own houses, on the contrary, they walk about so\r\nlightly, that they seem to be walking on eggs. [136]\r\n\r\n18. They are very early risers in their own houses, [137] for their\r\npoverty and the noise demand that. But if their masters sleep until\r\nten, they must do the same too.\r\n\r\n19. They must eat and try all that their masters eat, even though it\r\nbe something delicious or from Europa; and no Spaniard, and especially\r\nthe father minister, will have been able to succeed in making them\r\neat out of other dishes than those from which their master eats. I\r\nknow well that I have been unable to obtain it, notwithstanding my\r\nefforts. Neither will they drink out of another and separate jar. [138]\r\n\r\n20. Their manner of sitting is generally on their heels [en cuclillas],\r\nand they do that in all places except in the convents, where they\r\nbreak the seats with sitting on them and leaning back in them with\r\nout-stretched legs. And they must do this in the balconies, where\r\nthey can see the women. [139]\r\n\r\n21. They care more for their disheveled hair than they do for their\r\nsouls; and only they will not imitate the Spaniards if they have the\r\ncustom of shaving, as is now being introduced with the false hair\r\nand perukes. [140]\r\n\r\n22. Their usual habitation and happiness in the convents consists in\r\nnot leaving the kitchen. There they hold their meetings and feasts, and\r\nthere is their glory, as is the open country in Castilla. A religious\r\nwhom I knew, called the kitchen Flos sanctorum, [141] because the\r\nlife of the father and of all the village was discussed there.\r\n\r\n23. When they go out alone at night, they must have a blazing torch,\r\nand go about waving it like a censer; and then they throw it down\r\nwherever they please, and this is usually the cause of great fires.\r\n\r\n24. They would rather wear mourning than go about in gala dress,\r\nand are accordingly very observant in wearing it during their\r\nfunerals. [142]\r\n\r\n25. They do not esteem garments or gala dresses given them by their\r\nSpanish masters; and accordingly leave such in any place, without\r\nperceiving that they are losing them. But any old rag that they wear\r\nfrom their own houses they esteem and value highly.\r\n\r\n26. They do not care for any domestic animal--dog, cat, horse,\r\nor cow. They only care, and too much so, for the fighting cocks;\r\nand every morning, on rising from slumber, the first thing that they\r\ndo is to go to the roosting-place of their cock--where, squatting\r\ndown on their heels, in its presence, they stay very quietly for at\r\nleast a half-hour in contemplation of their cock. This observance is\r\nunfailing in them. [143]\r\n\r\n27. They live unwillingly in convents, or in houses where they cannot\r\nbe at least on the scent of women.\r\n\r\n28. It is not known that the Indian has [ever] broken a dish or a crock\r\nin his own house, and consequently one will find dishes in them that\r\ndate from before the arrival of the Spaniards in this country. But\r\nin the convents and houses where they serve, they break so many that\r\none would believe that they do it on purpose to do their masters an\r\nill turn. [144]\r\n\r\n29. One may not trust a sword, mirror, glass, musket, clock, or any\r\nother rare article to them; or allow them to touch it even with the\r\nhands; for immediately, by physical contact alone, they put it out\r\nof joint, break it, and harm it. They can only handle bamboo, rattan,\r\nnipa, or a bolo, and some few a plow. [145]\r\n\r\n30. They are insolent and free in begging for unjust and foolish\r\nthings, and this without considering time or season. When I\r\nremember the circumstance which happened to Sancho Pancha when he\r\nwas governor of the island of Barataria, one day after eating [146]\r\nwith an importunate and intrusive farmer, who said that he was from\r\nMiguel Turra, I am reminded of the Indians when they beg. [147]\r\nAnd we shall say that if they bring four eggs, they think that with\r\njustice they ought to be given a price of one hundred pesos. That\r\nis so true that when I see an Indian who is bringing something,\r\nwhich is always a thing of no value, or something that is of no\r\nuse to them, such as ates, mangas, or belinbiles [i.e., balimbing],\r\nI repeat those words of Laocoon to the Trojans: Timeo Danaos, [et]\r\ndona ferentes (2nd Æneid). An Indian came to beg from the bishop of\r\nTroya (as was told me by his illustrious Lordship)--Don Fray Gines\r\nBarrientos, [148] a specially circumspect prelate--the loan of fifty\r\npesos, for which he took him a couple of guavas. An Indian brought\r\na cock to the Marquis of Villa-sierra, Don Fernando de Valenzuela,\r\n[149] while he was in the fort of Cavite; and, when that gentleman\r\nordered that he be given more than six times its value, the Indian\r\ntold him that what he wanted was to be given eighty cavans of rice,\r\n[150] and that in a time of so great scarcity it was not to be had\r\nfor two pesos per cavan. But they have this curious peculiarity, that\r\nthey are just as happy if these things are not given to them as if\r\nthey had been given. For they have little or no esteem for what the\r\nSpaniards give them, and especially the father. Accordingly, when\r\nthey sell anything that is worth, say, six, [151] they ask thirty,\r\nand are satisfied if six be given them. [152]\r\n\r\nThey would rather have one real from the hand of the Sangley than one\r\npeso from the Spaniard; and the power that the Sangleys have over them\r\nis surprising, for they are generally cheated by those people. [153]\r\n\r\n31. They are very fond of play, [154] for they believe that it is\r\na restful way in which to gain much, and it is very suitable to\r\ntheir laziness and lack of energy. Therefore, an Indian would rather\r\nlie stretched out in his house than gain the greatest wage. On this\r\naccount, when he gets a peso he stays at home without working, until it\r\nis all eaten up or drunk up, for it all amounts to the same thing. This\r\nis the reason why they are so poor, in comparison with the Sangleys\r\nand mestizos, who live in abundance, for they know how to seek and\r\nwork. [155] Egestatem operata est manus remissa. (Proverbs X, verse 4.)\r\n\r\n32. They have contradictory peculiarities, such as being very cowardly,\r\nwhile on some occasions they are rash; for they confess that they\r\nwould rather suffer a hundred lashes than to have one shout aloud\r\nto them--which, they say, penetrates even to the heart, without the\r\ncause being known.\r\n\r\n33. It is laughable to see them waken another who is sleeping like a\r\nstone, when they come up without making any noise and touching him\r\nvery lightly with the point of the finger, will call him for two\r\nhours, until the sleeper finishes his sleep and awakens. The same\r\nthing is done when they call anyone downstairs, or when the door is\r\nshut; for they remain calling him in a very low tone for two hours,\r\nuntil he casually answers and opens to them. [156]\r\n\r\n34. In another way, they exhibit other rash actions, by which it\r\nis seen that their rashness is rather the daughter of ignorance and\r\nbarbarity than of valor. For it occurs that an Indian, man or woman,\r\nmay be walking along the road and hear a horse which is coming behind\r\nhim, running or going at a quick pace; but this Indian never turns\r\nhis face. If the horse come in front of him, he will not turn out of\r\nthe road so that he may not be trampled underfoot, if he who comes\r\non horseback does not turn out with greater consideration. The same\r\nthing occurs when they see a very large banca coming down upon them\r\nwith long sweeps of the oars, while they are in a small banquilla;\r\nwhen they will allow themselves to be struck by it, with the danger\r\nof being overturned and drowned. It costs much labor to those in the\r\nlarge banca to avoid that, while the others could do it with great\r\nease. This has happened to me on innumerable occasions. [157]\r\n\r\n35. The same thing happens in the rivers where there are crocodiles,\r\nalthough they see them swimming about; for they say the same as do the\r\nMoros [i.e., Mahometans], that if it is from on high it must happen,\r\neven though they avoid it. And thus, as says father Fray Gabriel Gomez\r\n(History of Argel, book 2, chapter 19), they say in the lengua franca\r\n\"God is great! Be not led by fancy! The world is just so. If it\r\nis written on the forehead that one is to live, then he will live;\r\nbut if not, then he will die here.\" [158] For their Koran says that\r\neach one has his fortune written in the lines of his forehead. These\r\nIndians believe the same thing (and they have never seen the Koran),\r\nand only because it is great nonsense. They receive no warning from\r\nthe many misfortunes that happen every day for their sins. [159]\r\n\r\n36. While it is a fact that they are extremely credulous among\r\nthemselves, they will believe of the Spaniards only what is against\r\nthem. Therefore, it is evident that the [Christian] faith is a\r\nsupernatural act, in that they believe the divine mysteries taught by\r\nthe Spaniards. However, they do not believe some things, or refuse to\r\nbelieve them because they find the contrary profitable. Consequently,\r\nthere is no one who can persuade them that it is a sin to steal\r\nfrom the religious ministers or the Spaniards. Of this we have such\r\nproofs that we have not the slightest doubt that it is so; but,\r\nonly perceiving it is not being able to remedy it. [160]\r\n\r\nSo great is the ease and tenacity with which they believe the greatest\r\nnonsense, if this is to the discredit of the Spaniards or against\r\nthem, that it would be a long undertaking to recount some of it. I\r\nhave deemed it advisable to mention only two [instances] of it of\r\nwhich I heard [161] and of which I was a witness, so that the rest\r\ncan be inferred from them.\r\n\r\n37. While I was in Bisayas in the year 1672, those islands began to\r\nbe depopulated and the Indians began to take to the mountains from\r\nthe visitas of Xaro, because a rogue told them a bit of nonsense\r\nlike the following. He told them that the king of España had gone\r\nout fishing, and the Turks had come upon him and made him captive;\r\nand that the king had given for his ransom all the Indians of the\r\nprovince of Oton. They believed this so thoroughly that it was with\r\ngreat difficulty that the alcalde Don Sebastian de Villarreal and\r\nthe father ministers could quiet them, and considerable time passed\r\nbefore they were sure of the whole matter. [162]\r\n\r\nThe second: While I was in the village of Lipa, a mine was discovered\r\nin that of Tanavan which was said to be of silver. Governor Don Fausto\r\nCruzat y Gongorà sent ministers and officials in order to find out\r\nabout it and to assay it. These men made their efforts, but the mine\r\nonly said, Argentum et aurum non est mihi. [163] But the devil willed\r\nto have some rogue at this time to sow this deceit, namely, that the\r\nministers [164] said that the mine would yield no silver until all\r\nthe old women of Cometan had been caught, and their eyes plucked out\r\nand mixed with other ingredients, in order to anoint the vein of the\r\nmine with that mixture. This was believed, so that all was confusion\r\nand lamentation, and the old women hid in the fields; and it took\r\na long time to quiet them, and cost the ministers great difficulty,\r\nas the Indians would not believe them because they were Castilians,\r\nuntil time itself undeceived them. [165]\r\n\r\n38. May God deliver us from any one of those Indians whom they consider\r\nas sages, who says any bit of nonsense, even though it be against the\r\nfaith, [166] and they only respond, Vica nong maronong, \"Thus say\r\nthe sages,\" and it is labor lost to persuade them to the contrary;\r\nfor the authority that these scholars have over them is incredible.\r\n\r\n39. They are extremely arrogant, and hence the son will not obey his\r\nfather, or the headman, or captain of the village. [167] They are\r\nonly bound in this by fear, and when they have no fear they will\r\nnot obey. They only recognize the Spaniard to be more than they;\r\n[168] and this they say only because of an interior impulse, which\r\nforces them against their will and without their knowing why. This\r\nis the providence of God, so that they can be governed.\r\n\r\n40. They are very fond if imitating the Spaniard [169] in all his\r\nbad traits, such as variety of clothes, cursing, gambling, and the\r\nrest that they see the coxcombs [170] do. They shun the imitation of\r\nthe good things in the dealings and civilization of the Spaniards,\r\nand in the proper rearing of their children. For in all the rest\r\nthat treats of trickery, drunken revelries, and ceremonies in their\r\nmarriages, burials, and tyrannies one against another, they observe\r\nexactly what they learned from their ancestors. Thus they unite in\r\none the vices of the Indians and the Spaniards. [171]\r\n\r\n41. Just as the poor are arrogant, so also are the old ones ignorant,\r\nand they are not to be distinguished from the youths. Consequently,\r\nin their weddings, banquets, and revelries one will see old men with\r\nwhite hair, mixed with the lads; and slouchy old women with their\r\nscapularies, clapping their hands and singing nonsensical things with\r\nthe lasses. Scarcely is there an Indian who knows his age, and many\r\n[172] do not know the baptismal names of their wives, after they have\r\nbeen baptized for fifty years. [173]\r\n\r\n42. They are so ignorant that they do not have the slightest knowledge\r\nconcerning the origin of the ancestors from whom they descend,\r\nand whence they came to settle these islands. They do not give any\r\ninformation concerning their paganism, which is not the worst; and\r\nthey only preserve in certain parts some ridiculous abuses, which\r\nthey observe at births and sicknesses, and the cursed belief that\r\npersuades them that the souls of their ancestors or the grandfathers\r\nof the families are present in the trees and at the bottom of bamboos,\r\nand that they have the power of giving and taking away health and of\r\ngiving success or failure to the crops. Therefore, they make their\r\nancestors offerings of food, according to their custom; and what\r\nhas been preached to them and printed in books avails but little,\r\nfor the word of any old man regarded as a sage has more weight with\r\nthem than the word of the whole world. [174]\r\n\r\n43. They act tyrannically one toward another. Consequently, the Indian\r\nwho has some power from the Spaniard is insolent [175] and intolerable\r\namong them--so much so that, in the midst of their ingratitude, some\r\nof them recognize it, although very few of them. Yet it is a fact\r\nthat, if the Spaniards had not come to these islands, the Indians\r\nwould have been destroyed; for, like fish, [176] the greater would\r\nhave swallowed the lesser, in accordance with the tyranny which they\r\nexercised in their paganism. [177]\r\n\r\n44. They are wanting in understanding and reflection, so that they do\r\nnot recognize any means in anything, but go to extremes. Consequently,\r\nif one ask them for warm water, they bring it boiling, and then if they\r\nare reproached and told that one wishes it more temperate, they go and\r\nbring it back as cold as ice. [178] In this vicious circle of extremes,\r\nthey will continue ceaselessly without finding a mean. Consider then,\r\nhow they will act in prudential matters, where one must seek the mean\r\nand not the extremes, as says the poet: [179]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Es[t] modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines.\r\n    Quos ultra, citraque nequit consistere rectum. [180]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the cause of great anxiety to us, and with them a cause\r\nof great happiness to see us grow impatient, even though it cost\r\nthem some blows, which they take very willingly because they make us\r\nimpatient. They celebrate this in a lively manner in the kitchen. There\r\nis nothing that the Indian regrets more than to see the Spaniard or\r\nthe father calm, and that he patiently and with forbearance restrains\r\nhis hand from them when it is necessary; for but rarely do they do\r\nanything willingly, and hence the most prudent among them are wont\r\nto say that \"the rattan grows where the Indian is born.\" [181] Virga\r\nin dorso ejus, qui indiget corde (Proverbs x, 13).\r\n\r\nThey resemble in this a mischievous lad who served a good cleric. One\r\nday his master sent him to buy a hen, and he stole and hid a\r\nleg. [182] His master was silent, and overlooked the incident. It\r\ncame to pass that the master and the lad walked into a field, where\r\nthey came upon some cranes, all of them with one foot lifted high\r\nin the air. Thereupon the lad said to his master, \"Sir, the hen was\r\nlike these birds which have but one foot.\" The cleric answered, \"No,\r\nmy lad, for these birds have two feet; and if you do not believe\r\nit, look.\" So saying, he threw a stick at the cranes, which flew\r\naway in fright, showing the other foot. At this the lad said, \"O,\r\nsir, had you done the same with me, the hen would also have had two\r\nfeet.\" Doubtless, this lad must have been of the same disposition as\r\nthese good brothers, who do nothing good without a beating. Tu virga\r\npercuties eum (Proverbs XXIII, 14). [183]\r\n\r\nIt happened that an Augustinian religious--who still lives and is very\r\nwell known for his great learning--arrived in these islands in the\r\nyear 1684, and was given, shortly after his arrival, a lad of eight\r\nor nine years for his service. The lad was so clever and lively, that\r\nhe was held in esteem, [184] and the said religious was very fond of\r\nhim because of his great activity. The lad considered that the father\r\nwas very patient with him, and chid his neglect very mildly. One day\r\nhe said to the father \"Father, you know that you are new. Consider\r\nthe Indians like myself. You must not overlook anything. If you\r\nwish to be well served, you must keep a rattan, and when I commit\r\nany fault, you must strike me with it; and then you will see that I\r\nshall move as quickly as a sparrowhawk. For you must know, Father,\r\nthat the rattan grows where the Indian is born. So have I heard said\r\nby the old Indians.\" [185] Trouble enough do the poor wretches have,\r\nfor one may say of them: Oderunt peccare mali formidinæ penæ. [186]\r\n\r\n45. One can give them nothing, even if it be given, [187] for if he\r\nhappen to give one anything in the presence of others, even if it\r\nbe a needle, [188] all will demand that in justice the same be given\r\nto them. In this they closely resemble the laborers of the twentieth\r\nchapter of St. Matthew, who construed as an injury the favor that the\r\nhouseholder showed to their companions. This is covetousness and lack\r\nof consideration. So far is this foolishness carried that the Indian\r\nwill take fifty lashes willingly, if he knows with certainty that all\r\nthe others are to get as much. Surely they cause great trouble with\r\nthis wretched habit, and those who might confer some benefit on them\r\noften avoid doing so.\r\n\r\n46. They are so distrustful that they think that the ground on which\r\nthey walk and the air which they breathe are about to fail. This does\r\nnot make them more provident and industrious, but more foolish and\r\ndull. Therefore, if there are many to confess they troop together all\r\nin a body, each one desirous of being first. This causes extraordinary\r\ntrouble and impatience to the confessor. But, if there are but few,\r\nthey come a legua apart; and one must summon them, and they take an\r\nhour to come. If the father rises in anger, or because it is late,\r\nthen they all come together in a crowd, and say \"Father, me only.\" This\r\nis a bit of foolishness in which one can trace the great deficiency\r\nof their understanding. [189]\r\n\r\n47. As they are so curious, and fond of knowing whatever does not\r\nconcern them, what occurs when many of them confess together is\r\nwondrous to see. For all of them keep a steadfast gaze on the one who\r\nis confessing. One is astonished and amused to see all the women with\r\ntheir faces turned backward [190] so that they seem to be biformed\r\nJanuses, or paid dancers with a mask at the back of the head. In this\r\nmanner, they remain until the end of the function. The same is true on\r\nAsh Wednesday or at the adorations of the cross on Holy Friday, when\r\nall of them wish to kiss at one time, or in other similar functions.\r\n\r\n48. They are much given to the sin of blasphemy, [191] because of their\r\nnatural vileness, their pride, and their presumption. Hence it is quite\r\nusual for them to complain of God, whom they call Paghihinanaquit,\r\nasking why He does not give them this or that, and health or wealth,\r\nas He does to other creatures. They utter words of nonsense that\r\nhorrify those who do not know that it proceeds from their great\r\nlack of understanding and consideration, and from their very great\r\ndisability for conforming themselves with the divine will. [192] Thus\r\nthe royal prophet David, when compelled by his superior enthusiasm to\r\ntouch what he considered inferior matter, and [when he] lifted up his\r\ncomplaints of the divine Providence, was excused by his ignorance,\r\nas will be seen in Psalm LXXII, [23], where he humbles himself,\r\nsaying: Ut jumentum factus sum apud te: et ego semper tecum. [193]\r\n\r\n49. They are very vain, [194] and they spend their money never more\r\nwillingly than in functions of vanity; for they consider themselves\r\nhighly, and wish to be esteemed without doing anything worthy of\r\nesteem. The men especially, even though they do not have anything\r\nto eat, must not for that reason fail to have a shirt and a hat,\r\nand to dress in style. They give banquets very frequently, for very\r\nslight causes; and everything resolves itself into eating, drinking,\r\nand great noise. Their vanity is the only thing that causes them to\r\nlessen their laziness, in order to get the wherewithal to keep up\r\nthis esteem, and applause from their compatriots. [195]\r\n\r\n50. They are revengeful to an excessive degree--so much so that\r\nthey are vile and cowardly, and the ministers have great trouble in\r\nreconciling them with their enemies; and although they do it through\r\nfear, it is never with the whole heart, for this passion has great\r\ninfluence over them. And since they need magnanimity and manliness\r\nto overcome it, and these virtues are foreign to them, [196] hate\r\ngenerally forces its roots into them so deeply that it is impossible\r\nto eradicate it in a whole lifetime. [197]\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why they are so inclined to litigation, and to\r\ngoing before the audiencias and courts with their quarrels, [198] in\r\nwhich they willingly spend their possessions for the sole purpose of\r\nmaking others spend theirs and of causing them harm and trouble. For\r\nthat they are even wont to pledge their sons and daughters. [199]\r\n\r\n51. In order to be contrary in everything to other nations, they have\r\nlust but no love. This is in regard to the illicit love; for in the\r\nsupernatural love which grace causes in the sacrament of marriage\r\n(since divine impulse works in this) their evil disposition is\r\nconquered and most of them make very good husbands. But in illicit\r\nintercourse the men have no other purpose than bodily appetite,\r\nand to deprive [of virginity] as many women as they have done, in\r\norder to sport with it. For it is a long established custom among\r\nthem that the women shall give to the men, and the latter shall be\r\nthe ones served and fêted; while only blows, kicks, and trouble are\r\ngiven to the women. So true is this that one might say that they have\r\nan inferno both in this and in the other world. Hence the women are\r\nvery poorly clad, for the men want everything for themselves. [200]\r\n\r\n52. But in the midst of this, which appears inhuman, one may praise\r\nthem for having succeeded in treating their wives as they deserve,\r\nin order to keep them submissive and happy; for this submission makes\r\nthem better, and humble, and prudent, and conformable to their sentence\r\nof being subject to man. And if the Europeans would learn this useful\r\nand prudent management from them, they would live in greater peace\r\nand with less expense; and marriage would be more mild and quiet, and\r\nwell ordered, according to reason, and better directed toward the end\r\nfor which it was instituted--as we see is the case with these people,\r\nwith a fertility that causes our wonder.\r\n\r\n53. They have another remarkable custom, which has been taught them by\r\nthe infernal Machiavelian [201] Satan, which is good for their bodies,\r\nbut bad for their souls. This is that they observe very strictly the\r\nconcealment of one another's faults and wrong-doing. They endeavor\r\nto see that no transgression comes to the ear of the father minister,\r\nor alcalde, or any Spaniard. They observe this with peculiar secrecy,\r\nalthough they may be at enmity among themselves, and ready to kill\r\nas they say. Consequently, the most serious crime that can happen\r\namong them is to tell the father or alcalde what is passing in\r\nthe village. [202] They call that mabibig, because it is the most\r\nabominable fault and the only sin among them. [203]\r\n\r\n54. This worst of customs is very prejudicial and troublesome to the\r\nSpaniards and to the father ministers. For it might happen that one\r\nhas one servant (or all) who wastes and destroys the property of his\r\nmaster, and there is [no one] who will tell him what is passing. [204]\r\nBut if it happens that the wasteful servant leave, then all the others\r\ntell what he did; and, whatever is lacking afterward, they throw the\r\nblame on that absent servant. If the Spaniard reprove the servant whom\r\nhe most esteems and benefits, asking him why he did not tell of the\r\nevil that the other servant was doing, he replies with great dudgeon\r\nthat they must not accuse him of being mabibig, or talebearer of what\r\nhappens. This is what takes place, even if the servants know that they\r\nare flaying their master. Consequently, the first thing that they do\r\nwhen any new servant comes is, to threaten him if he turn mabibig,\r\nand afterwards make him do all the work that belongs to them all,\r\nwhile the old servants are quite free from toil. Hence the fewer\r\nservants a Spaniard has, the better served will he be; for only the\r\nnewcomer works and does everything, and the others not only do nothing,\r\nbut are all served by him. [205]\r\n\r\n55. They have another peculiarity, which always causes me great\r\nwonder. I am trying to discover the cause therefor, but I only find,\r\nso far as I can make out, that it is due to their incapacity and\r\ningratitude and their horror of the Spaniards. This is, that while the\r\ndifference between the poverty, wretchedness, and want of their houses\r\nand the anxiety and poverty in which they live, when compared with the\r\nabundance, good cheer, good clothes, and comfort which they enjoy in\r\nthe service of certain Spaniards is almost infinite, if they happen\r\nto be discharged, or to leave for some very slight cause occasioned\r\nby their pride and vanity, they turn from one extreme to the other,\r\nso contented with the present misery that they do not remember or\r\neven consider the past abundance. If they be asked in what condition\r\nthey lived better, they answer that everything is one and the same,\r\nand hence we do not get revenge by sending them away in anger [en\r\nembiarlos con Dios]. But what great happiness is theirs! [206]\r\n\r\n56. They would rather scorn the goods of the father or of the Spaniards\r\nthan enjoy them and profit by them. Hence what they lose is greater\r\nthan what they spend.\r\n\r\n57. They are greatly lacking in foresight. Hence the servants and\r\nstewards do not advise their master to procure any article until it\r\nis completely gone. Therefore when they say that there is no more\r\nsugar or no more oil, it is when there is not [oil] enough to whet\r\na knife. [207] Consequently, great deficiencies and annoyances are\r\nsuffered because of this custom.\r\n\r\n58. If there are visitors or guests to dine with the master, they do\r\nnot consider the guests at all, thus causing the poor master of the\r\nhouse great shame; [208] and it is necessary for him to excuse himself\r\nby the poor instruction that the devil gave them in this matter. No\r\nmisfortune can be greater to him than to offend against his civility;\r\nand in a manner that seems good to them, for doubtless they are so\r\npersuaded by the devil. It is also their custom, when there is company,\r\nfor all to go to the kitchen and leave the master alone. [209]\r\n\r\n59. Their stomachs are like sackbuts, with systole and diastole;\r\n[210] and thus they contract and expand them in a wonderful manner. For\r\nalthough they observe parsimony in their own houses, it is a matter for\r\nwhich to praise God to see them gorge themselves and gulp down things\r\nat the expense of the Spaniards, as Quevedo said there of Galalon:\r\n\"Galalon, who eats but little at home, overloads his goodly paunch\r\nat another's expense.\" [211]\r\n\r\n60. But say to them, Buen provecho; [212] for usually these losses\r\nare well retrieved when they row. They are horrifying and frightful\r\nin venting their anger, both against one another, and against the\r\nfather ministers; and there would be so much to say in this that it\r\nwould never be finished. [213] They are able to make their complaints\r\nin such a manner and to such purpose that they persuade those who\r\nknow most about their falsity and trickery that they are telling the\r\ntruth. I remember that an alcalde of experience [214] was heard to\r\nsay, when the Indians came to him with complaints: Audivi auditionem\r\ntuam, et timui. [215] There are usually Indians, both men and women,\r\nin the suburbs of Manila, who hire out as mourners in the manner of\r\nthe mourners of the Hebrews, and such as were in style in Castilla\r\nin the time of the Cid. The authors of the quarrel go first into\r\nthe house of some lawyer [216] well known for his cleverness, who is\r\none of those called in law rabulas, [217] who do not know which is\r\ntheir right hand. These men keep books of formulas and of petitions\r\ndirected against all the human race; for example, in this form, \"suit\r\nagainst alcalde;\" and then follow all the crimes and excesses that\r\ncan be committed by alcaldes. [218] The same thing is true of suits\r\nagainst ministers and curas, and in them is enclosed all possibility\r\nof irregular conduct. Then the said \"smith of calumny,\" [219] as the\r\nItalian says, takes the names of the plaintiffs and defendants, and\r\na few facts; and then puts it all in the book from beginning to end\r\n[de pe á pa], without omitting one iota. And this is not to speak\r\nuncertainly; for in the archives of the court will be found the\r\nchart which was discovered in the possession of a certain rabula\r\nnamed Silva, who, in addition to this had skill in counterfeiting\r\nroyal decrees and documents.\r\n\r\n61. When the petition has been made, they go with it to the mourners,\r\nand they go to press their suit with a lamentation like that of\r\nMagedo for King Josias, which would soften stones. [220] That has\r\nbeen investigated by several governors in my time. I remember one\r\ninvestigation by Don Juan de Vargas, and another by Don Gabriel de\r\nCruce-laegui; and many who are living remember them. Let them judge,\r\nthen, the pity that ought to be expressed for the father ministers,\r\nwhose honor is exposed to so great danger.\r\n\r\n62. Their cunning and diabolical cleverness in making an accusation\r\nis not the equal [i.e., is more than the equal] of their capacity;\r\nand it is known that they have the special suggestion of the\r\nfather of discord, Satan. I remember that they brought to a certain\r\nprovincial a complaint against the father minister, saying that he\r\nkept twelve Indians busy in caring for but one horse. The provincial\r\nmade an investigation and found that the father had but one Indian,\r\nand that he used the said horse a great deal, in order to attend\r\nto the administration of souls. When the calumniators were chidden\r\nfor the falsity of their complaint, they explained it by saying,\r\n\"Father, that Indian is, in truth, but one; but he is changed every\r\nmonth, and at the end of the year there are twelve men.\" Just see\r\nwhat subtlety, and what confusion in their arithmetic, in order to\r\nmake their accusation--the Indians maliciously speaking of a year\r\nin order to give color to their calumny. [221] So many cases of this\r\nsort can be stated, that they are unending. And with all this, these\r\nnatives have such persuasiveness, or powers of enchantment, that they\r\ngenerally deceive and persuade the most experienced with their lies.\r\n\r\n63. Inasmuch as any sort of complaint is received, without subjecting\r\nthe accuser to a penalty in case that he cannot prove his allegations\r\n[222]--as ought to be the case, and according to the orders of the\r\nMexican Council--no one's honor is safe. For, if they prove their\r\naccusations, they are the gainers, while if they do not prove them\r\nthey return home as cool as ever, for they always go to gain and\r\nnever to lose. [223]\r\n\r\n64. They are very fond of ceremonial acts and festivals where there\r\nis some novelty; and fond of long pilgrimages [224] to images of some\r\nnew miracle, while they forget about the old. [225]\r\n\r\n65. They are especially fond of comedies and farces, and therefore,\r\nthere is no feast of consequence, unless there is a comedy. [226]\r\nIf possible they will lose no rehearsal, and in all they pay\r\nattention only to the witty fellow who does innumerable foolish and\r\nuncouth things, and at each of his actions they burst into hearty\r\nlaughter. He who plays this part acceptably receives his diploma as\r\nan ingenious fellow, and has permission to go and come anywhere, and\r\neven to cajole the women before their husbands; and the latter must\r\nlaugh, even though they have no wish to do so. It is very necessary\r\nthat these representations be not harmful, for many of them are\r\nprinted. Accordingly, they receive considerable benefit from these\r\nfunctions and external acts, such as the descent from the cross,\r\nand other representations, which are patterned after those called\r\nescuitales [227] in Nueba España--in which is verified the truth of\r\nthe sentence in the Ars Poetica of Horace, verses 18[0-181]. [228]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Segnius irritant animos demisa per aures,\r\n    Quam quæ sunt oculis conspecta fidelibus.\r\n\r\n\r\n66. Consequently, those who have experience are wont to declare\r\nthat the faith enters into the Indians through the eyes; and hence\r\nit seems worthy of consideration that it was the apostle St. Thomas\r\nwhom our Lord [229] had prepared for the teaching of the Indians--he\r\nwho desired that the belief in his glorious resurrection might enter\r\nthrough the eyes: Nisi videro ... non credam (John xx, 25).\r\n\r\n67. They are extreme in their observance of their usages and customs,\r\nwhich they call ogali. To be found wanting in these is a great infamy;\r\nand, consequently, in order not to break them they will trample\r\neverything under foot. The ceremonies and abuses practiced in their\r\nweddings and funerals are numerous and curious, and no success has\r\nbeen had in suppressing them, notwithstanding all the efforts that\r\nhave been made; for all they want from the Spaniards is their clothes,\r\nand all the evil that they see in them. I believe that these customs\r\nwill never be suppressed. [230]\r\n\r\n68. Another curious peculiarity is that although there are generally\r\nsome few who are jealous, if they have any business with the Spaniards,\r\nthey will not go themselves, but will send their wives or daughters\r\nwithout any fear of danger, in order that their business may be well\r\ndespatched. [231]\r\n\r\n69. They are very material and literal in their conversations, and\r\none cannot say the slightest word to the women in jest, however slight\r\nit be; for the most discreet thing that they will answer to one will\r\nbe, Tampalasanca, which means, \"You are a [232] shameless fellow;\"\r\nand, if not that, [233] a tempest of words, that will make him repent\r\nhaving given occasion for them. [234] This alone is their custom with\r\nthe Spaniards. [235]\r\n\r\n70. It is a thing to be wondered at that even the dogs have another\r\ndisposition, and have a particular aversion toward Spaniards. When\r\nthey see Spaniards, they choke themselves with barking. And when the\r\nchildren see a father they cry immediately, [236] and thus from their\r\ncradle they begin to hold every white face in horror. [237]\r\n\r\n71. They are so cowardly that they fear any Indian who becomes a bully\r\namong them--so much that, if they only see him with a poor knife,\r\nthey fear him so greatly that he can do whatever he wishes. All the\r\nvillage together will not be bold enough to arrest him, for they\r\nsay that he is posong, which is the same as \"bold.\" I have had many\r\nexamples of this. [238]\r\n\r\n72. The vice of drunkenness is regarded by them as rank in the\r\nfourth degree, [239] and they have made it a point of nobility;\r\nfor the chiefest men think that they are the best workmen at this\r\noccupation. [240] It is a fact that those most given to this vice\r\nare the Ilocans, then the Visayans, and then our Tagálogs. [241] The\r\nPampangos can be exempted from this rule, for they are very temperate\r\nin this wretched habit, as well as in all the other things which we\r\nhave mentioned. They are very different: for they are truthful, and\r\nlove their honor; are very brave, and inclined to work; and are more\r\ncivil, and of better customs. In regard to the vices here mentioned\r\n(for they are, in the last analysis, Indians like the rest), they\r\nkeep them more out of sight and covered. In all things the Pampangos\r\nhave a nobleness of mind that makes them the Castilians of these\r\nsame Indians. Consequently, that people must be distinguished from\r\nthe rest in its character, in all that we have said.\r\n\r\n73. Returning now to the others, in general, they possess vanity\r\nwithout honor; for among them it is no reason for less esteem to\r\nbe drunkards, robbers, or connivers in evil deeds, or [to practice]\r\nother like virtues. [242] They lose reputation and honor only if they\r\nget the reputation of being sorcerers. Consequently, in the opinion of\r\na very learned minister, there is no case of a restitution of honor,\r\nunless some accusation of this infamous sin is imputed to them. In\r\ntheir marriages and among their kindred their disgust is not moved\r\nexcept by this, for the others are excused by self interest, but this\r\nfault is not. [243]\r\n\r\n74. All that I have said of the men is very different in the women,\r\nsaltem quoad modum. [244] For they are of better morals, are docile\r\nand affable, and show great love to their husbands and to those who\r\nare not their husbands. They are really very modest in their actions\r\nand conversation, to such a degree that they have a very great horror\r\nof obscene words; and if weak nature craves acts, their natural modesty\r\nabhors words. [245] The notion that I have formed of them is that they\r\nare very honorable, and, most of all, the married women. Although beans\r\nare boiled, it is not by the kettleful, as in other regions. [246]\r\nScarcely will one find a Tagálog or Pampango Indian woman, who will\r\nput her person to trade; and they are not so abandoned as we see in\r\nthe women in other regions. They are very averse toward the Spaniard,\r\nand love the equality [in marriage] of their own nation; and, as a\r\nforeign religious said, are suited \"each man to each woman.\" They\r\nrarely have any love for a Spaniard. They have another peculiarity,\r\nwhich if the Indian women of America had, that land would not be so\r\nfull of mulattoes, who are a ferocious and wicked race. This is their\r\nhorror for Cafres and negroes, which is so great that they would sooner\r\nsuffer themselves to be killed than to receive them. The Visayan women,\r\nhowever, are ready for everything, and are not so fastidious. On the\r\ncontrary, they are very ready to consent to any temptation. [247]\r\n\r\n75. The women are very devout, and in every way of good habits. The\r\ncause for this is that they are kept so subject and so closely\r\noccupied; for they do not lift their hands from their work, since in\r\nmany of the villages they support their husbands and sons, while the\r\nlatter are busied in nothing else but in walking, [248] in gambling,\r\nand wearing fine clothes, while the greatest vanity of the women is\r\nin the adornment and demeanor of these gentlemen, for they themselves\r\nare very poorly and modestly [249] clad.\r\n\r\n76. In all that I have said, to this point, concerning the nature and\r\nmorals of these poor people, I have done no more than to approximate\r\n[to the truth], as the mathematicians have done in the squaring of\r\nthe circle. For an essential, substantial, and exhaustive definition\r\n[250] is for some other person, to whom divine Providence chooses\r\nto communicate this difficult matter. [251] Very praiseworthy is\r\nBarclayo, for in his Eupormion and his Argenis, [252] he succeeded\r\nin discerning the natures of nations; as did Juan Rodemborgio, [253]\r\nand our Gracian in his Criticon. [254] But had they treated of the\r\nFilipinos, they would not have been so successful.\r\n\r\n77. The bishop of La Puebla, Don Juan Palafox, [255] wrote a keen\r\ntreatise on the virtues of the Indians of Nueva España, in which\r\nhis uncommon intellect and his holy and good intention are displayed\r\nmore clearly than is the truth of his argument on the subject; for\r\nin a curious way he endeavors to make virtues of all their vices and\r\nevil inclinations. For in what they merit before God through their\r\nwills, they do not merit if it be the impelling force of their\r\nnatural inclination and manner of living, because absuetiis non\r\nfit passio. [256] One cannot, indeed, compare the voluntary poverty\r\nof St. Francis with that of the Indians, which is born of laziness\r\nand full of greed; for theirs is the infamous poverty which Virgil\r\nplaces in hell: et turpis egestas. [257] And just as the economy of\r\na poor wretch is not reckoned as fasting, so it will not be proper\r\nto say that if St. Antony [258] went barefoot, the Indians do the\r\nsame; and that they live on certain roots, as did the fathers of the\r\nThebaid. [259] For the fasting and the austerities of St. Arsenius\r\n[260] had a different impelling motive--since he left the pleasures\r\nand esteem of the court of the emperor Theodosius [261]--than that\r\nwhich they can have, being so born and reared, and never having\r\nseen anything else. Hence, Ovid says of the Getas that they left the\r\ndelights and comforts of Roma, and returned to seek the poverty and\r\nmisery to which they were accustomed in Pontus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Roma quid meltus scyt[h]ico [262] quid frigore peius?\r\n    Húc tamen ex illa Barbarus urbe fugit. [263]\r\n\r\n\r\n78. It is not my intention to include the Sangley mestizos here,\r\nas they are a different race. For although they were the children of\r\nIndians at the beginning, they have been approaching more and more\r\nto the Chinese nation with the lapse of successive generations. Et\r\ncompositum ex multis atrahit ad se nuturam simplicis dignioris. [264]\r\nConsequently, I leave their description for whomever wishes to\r\nundertake that task; for I fear that I shall succeed but very ill\r\nwith the task which I have here undertaken, as it is so difficult.\r\n\r\n79. Finally, summing up all the above, the inference will be that\r\nall the actions of these wretched beings are such as are dictated\r\nby nature through the animal, intent solely on its preservation\r\nand convenience, without any corrective being applied by reason,\r\nrespect, and esteem for reputation. Consequently, he who first said\r\nof a certain people that if they saw the whole world hanging on one\r\nnail and needed that nail in order to hang up their hat, they would\r\nfling the world down in order to make room for the hat, would have\r\nsaid it of the Indians had he known them. For they think only of\r\nwhat is agreeable to them, or of what the appetite dictates to them;\r\nand this they will put in action, if fear, which also dwells in them,\r\ndo not dissuade them. [265] Hence they will be seen dressed in the\r\nshirts and clothes of their masters, for the sole reason [266] that\r\nbecause they no sooner enter any house than they become the owners\r\nof everything in it. And the worst thing is that, although they are\r\nnot good and faithful servants, intrant in gaudium domini sui. [267]\r\n\r\n80. They also have other qualities worthy of envy, non quoad causam sed\r\nquoad efectum. [268] Such is their contentment with their lot, for they\r\nbelieve that there is no people in the whole world better than they,\r\nand that if they possess a bamboo hut, a little rice for a few days,\r\na few small fish, and a couple of leaves of tobacco, they do not envy\r\nthe tables of Xerxes or Eliogabalus, [269] and can sing with Lucan:\r\n\r\n\r\n    O tuta potestas Augusti parvique laris.\r\n    Prohl munera nondum intellecta Deum quibus hoc\r\n    Contingere templis, vel posuit muris nullo\r\n    Trepidare tumulto, Cæsarea pulsata manu. [270]\r\n\r\n\r\n81. They are also worthy of envy for the calmness and conformity\r\nwith which they die, with so wonderful peace, as if they were\r\nmaking a journey from one village to another--the Lord working in\r\nthese creatures as the Lord that He is, [271] for in that transit\r\nHis mercy shines forth more; and thus said David (Psalm, XLVII, 21)\r\nDomini, Domini, exitus mortis; [272] whence that reduplication which\r\nthe Hebrew grammar calls ohatsere, [273] signifies the superlative\r\nin name and action. The same is the declaration of divine wisdom\r\n(Proverbs, XX): In viis justitiæ ambulo, in medio semitarum judicii,\r\nut ditem diligentes me. [274] The Father celestial summons them for\r\nthe relief of their burdens, and of the troubles which they have had\r\nduring life: Venite qui laboratis, et onerati estis, et ego reficiam\r\nvos (Matthew xi, 28). [275]\r\n\r\nFor it is a fact that if one consider the life and lot of most of them,\r\nthey resemble that merchant in the gospel of Matthew (chapter 13),\r\nwho gave all that he had for the precious pearl; for it costs them\r\nmore than is apparent to become Christians, with so much cutting of\r\ntimber, and many personal services; and thus God gives them the true\r\nrest of death, as to poor and needy ones. Parcet pauperi, et inopi,\r\net animas pauperum salvas faciet (Psalm, xii, 13). [276] Exiguo enim\r\nconceditur missericordia (Wisdom, vi, 7). [277]\r\n\r\n82. In all the aforesaid, I find no more than the claw by which this\r\nlion can be recognized, because of the difficulty of the matter;\r\ntherefore I refer the matter to another who has greater talent and\r\nexperience, who can tell more, since I cannot do everything. [278]\r\nI remember once to have heard from an inexperienced preacher this\r\ningenious bit of nonsense, that in praising St. John the Baptist he\r\ncited that passage of St. Matthew (chapter xi, [7]), coepit Jesus\r\ndicere [ad turbas] de Joanne;\r\n\r\n83. And he said that John was so great a saint, that even in the mouth\r\nof Christ our Lord it was [only] possible to begin speaking of him,\r\nbut that no end could be reached. The same I shall say of this matter,\r\nin all candor.\r\n\r\n84. There is no little to learn and study in the matter, concerning the\r\nmanner in which one must behave with them--especially we ministers,\r\nwho come from remote lands in order to assist and teach them;\r\nfor because of not understanding this aright many have become\r\ndisconsolate, and have conceived a horror of the Indians, and\r\nhave returned to España, or they have lived amid great hardship,\r\nin a continual combat of impatience and anxiety, thus frustrating\r\nthe good vocation which brought them to these islands, a vocation so\r\nacceptable to God our Lord. For, as says the angelic doctor St. Thomas,\r\n22, book 188, article 4: Deo nullum sacrificium est magis acceptum,\r\nquam celus animarum. [279] To those who take this charge upon them,\r\nthe words of the Lord in His revelations to St. Brigida are of great\r\nconsolation. Among many others, he says (book 2, chapter 6): Vos ergo\r\namici mei qui estis in mundo procedite securi, clamate, et anuntiate\r\nvoluntatem meam. Ego ero in corde et in ore vestro. Ego ero dux vester\r\nin via et consolator in morte. Non relinquam vos, procedite alacriter\r\nquia ex labore cresit gloria. [280] For it is a fact that all this\r\nexhortation is necessary, in order to combat the friction that is\r\ncaused to the European disposition by dealing with people of customs\r\nso different, and which has caused so many to lose their reason.\r\n\r\n85. Therefore the compass to which the navigator must always be\r\nattentive, in the gulf of the customs of this exasperating race,\r\nis patience. For this is the only remedy which Christ our Lord left\r\nto His disciples for the attainment of this ministry: (Luke xxi,\r\n[19]) In patientia vestra possidebitis animas vestras; and St. Paul,\r\nin Hebrews x, 36: patientia est vobis necessaria, ut reportetis,\r\nrepromissionis. [281]\r\n\r\n86. With this knowledge and without losing [282] this strong protection\r\none must continually consider that all these vices and evil traits\r\nare dictated and impelled by their nature, at times aided by the\r\nsuggestion of the common enemy when he hopes to succeed in causing us\r\nimpatience. Very worth considering in this are the words of St. Paul\r\n(2 Cor., xi, 19, 20): Libenter enim suffertis insipientes cum sitis\r\nipsi sapientes. Sustinetis enim si quis vos in servitutem redigit,\r\nsi quis devorat, si quis accipit, si quis extollitur, si quis infaciem\r\nvos cædit. [283] For all these hardships, and greater, must be suffered\r\nhere among these brothers. [284]\r\n\r\n87. I confess for my part that, at the beginning, I was afflicted\r\nand was greatly tormented, until with the lapse of time I came to\r\nrealize that such was their disposition and nature, and that these\r\ntrees could give no better fruit. In time it became to me a motive for\r\npraising God to see the variety of conditions and [285] customs which\r\nHe has placed in human nature, which is so beautified with variety;\r\nand I took particular pleasure in seeing youths and boys doing all\r\nthings backward--without any malice, and without having prompters,\r\nlike actors; but moved only by that hidden peculiarity that makes them\r\nso different from all other nations, and so uniform among themselves,\r\n[a likeness] which is so great that any one who has seen one of\r\nthese monopantos has seen them all. With these considerations I lived\r\nconsoled, and succeeded in making of them wax and wick, as the saying\r\nis. [286]\r\n\r\n88. First, one must not shout out at them, for that is a matter that\r\nfrightens and terrifies them greatly, as can be seen if one cries out\r\nat them when they are unaware--when the whole body trembles; and they\r\nsay that a single cry of the Spaniard penetrates quite to their souls.\r\n\r\n89. One must not strike them with the hands, for if we are of flesh,\r\nthey are of iron, and the hand will suffer greatly, for God does not\r\nchoose that they be corrected so indecently. [287]\r\n\r\n90. All of their faults must not be overlooked, for they will become\r\ninsolent and worse daily. Consequently, it is necessary for the father\r\nministers to give them some lashes as a father, with great moderation,\r\nfor it is enough to give lashes for vanity and haughtiness. This must\r\nbe observed especially in the lads, as is the order of the Holy Spirit\r\n(Proverbs, xxiii, 13, 14): Noli subtrahere a puero disciplinam; si enim\r\npercussieris eum virga, non morietur. Tu virga percuties eum: et animam\r\nejus de inferno liberabis. [288] The command of St. Gregory shall be\r\nobserved carefully (2 p. pastoral, chapter 6): Curandum quippe est ut\r\nrectorem subditis, et matrem, et patrem se exhibeat disciplina. [289]\r\n\r\n91. Nothing must be taken away from them, or received from them,\r\nwithout paying for it; for they are very poor, and the least thing\r\nproduces a great want with them. It must be considered that their\r\ngreatest misery arises from their laziness and rude condition, and that\r\nthat habit keeps them in its grasp, and they suffer great poverty;\r\nfor Egestatem operata est manus remissa (Proverbs, x, 4). We must\r\nconsider also that they support us and that they pay as they are\r\nable for our labors. If anything be given to them, let it be purely\r\n[290] for God's sake and as an alms, for if it be lent it will be\r\nentirely lost, both the merit and the patience [291]--considering\r\ntheir necessity and not their ingratitude, as a thing ordained by\r\nGod. Propter miseriam asume pauperem, et propter inopiam eius ne\r\ndimitas eum vacuum; et cætera (Ecclesiasticus, xxix, 12). [292]\r\n\r\n92. It is better, in selecting servants among the Indians for the\r\ninside of the house, to see that they be the sons of caciques or\r\nchiefs. They must be shown neither love nor familiarity. They must\r\nindeed always be treated well, but with uprightness and seriousness\r\nof face. It must be considered that in proportion as they are\r\nbetter caressed and clothed, the worse and more insolent they will\r\nbecome. This is the teaching of the Holy Spirit in Proverbs xxiv,\r\n21: Qui delicate a pueritia nutrit servum suum, postea sentiet eum\r\ncontumacem. They must be taught their duties, and must always be\r\nordered to perform them with prudence and circumspection, for otherwise\r\nthey will come gradually to lose respect for their master, and for\r\nthe character which God presents to them in the Spaniard in order to\r\ndominate them; and then will result the same thing that happened to\r\nthe log which, Æsop says, was placed in the lake by Jupiter to be king\r\nof the frogs. But the frogs, seeing after a time that it did not move,\r\nmade sport of it, and jumped on top of it, etc. Not many things should\r\nbe ordered of them at one time; for their memories are very poor, and\r\nthey will only keep the last one in mind. The keys of the pantry or\r\nto the money must not be entrusted to them, for that would be placing\r\nopportunity and temptation in their hands, and they never resist\r\nit. Good instruction and subjection in the house, and, above all, the\r\ngood example of life which they see in their masters, instil much into\r\nthem; and under such conditions they generally become good servants,\r\nespecially those of the Pampango nation. On the other hand, also,\r\none must not expect a good servant in the house of a bad master. [293]\r\n\r\n93. One must not exhaust them or squeeze them much beyond what they\r\ncan give of themselves, as we do with the lemon, for all that will be\r\npressed out will be bitter, as says the proverb of the commentary;\r\nqui nimis emungit, solet extorquere cruorem. [294] Neither is it\r\nwell or proper to go about visiting the caciques or going up into\r\ntheir houses, except when necessity requires it; for immediately\r\nthe whole village will be filled with envy and complaint, and the\r\nesteem of the father ministers will suffer considerably. Besides,\r\ntheir stench and vice do not render this diversion desirable. [295]\r\n\r\n94. When [296] they are sent with a message to any place, one must\r\nvery patiently await some notable failure caused ordinarily by their\r\nnatural sloth and laziness. [297] Sicut acetum dentibus, et fumus\r\noculis, sic piger his qui miserunt illum (Proverbs, x, 26). [298]\r\n\r\n95. I do not believe that I should omit mention, saltem per transenam,\r\n[299] of a matter very worthy of consideration--namely, that if God\r\nchooses to chastise the flourishing Christianity of these islands for\r\nour and their sins, by placing it in the hands of Indians ordained as\r\npriests (as appears about to threaten us very soon), if God do not\r\napply a remedy, what abominations will not follow! For to declare\r\nthat they will change their customs [300] and the aforesaid vices\r\nis impossible. On the contrary, their arrogance will grow worse\r\nwith exaltation to so sublime an estate; their cupidity with power\r\nwill be better fed; their laziness, with the lack of necessity;\r\nand their vanity, with the applause that they would wish to have,\r\nfor they would desire to be served by those whom they would in\r\nanother estate respect and obey; and the villages would suffer\r\nfrom the curse mentioned in Isaiah xxiv, 2, sicut populus, sic\r\nsacerdos. For the Indian who is ordained does not become a priest\r\nbecause it is the calling that conduces to the most perfect estate,\r\n[301] but because of the great and almost infinite advantage that\r\ncomes to him with the new estate that he chooses. How much it differs\r\nfrom being a father cura, to be a baguntao or sexton! From paying\r\ntribute, to being paid a stipend! From going to the [compulsory]\r\ncutting of timber, to being served in it! From rowing in a banca,\r\nto be rowed in it! That does not count with a Spaniard, who, if he\r\nbecome a cleric, often gives up an office as alcalde-mayor, captain,\r\nor general, with many other comforts in his native place, while his\r\nhouse is exalted above all the nation of the Indians. Let one contrast\r\nthis with the vanity with which one who has been freed from the oar,\r\n[302] or from an ax in the cutting of timber, will give his hand to be\r\nkissed! What a burden for the village will be the father, and mother,\r\nsister and nieces ranked as ladies, when many other better women are\r\npounding rice! For if the Indian is insolent and intolerable with\r\nbut little power, what will he be with so much superiority! And if\r\nthe wedge from the same log [303] is so powerful, what will it be if\r\ndriven by so great authority! What plague of locusts can be compared\r\nto the destruction that they would cause in the villages? [304] What\r\nrespect will the Indians have for him, seeing that he is of their\r\ncolor and nation--and especially those who consider themselves as\r\ngood, and even better perhaps, than he who became a cura, while they\r\ndo not become anything better than bilango or servant? How severely\r\nthe good cura will chastise them, and for trifling offenses! [305]\r\nas we see the Indians do when they act as gobernadorcillos of their\r\nvillages for even a single year--when the first thing that they do,\r\nand in which they most delight, is immediately to place the picota\r\n[306] in front of their houses, in order to apply lashes with the\r\nhangman's strap [penca]. What tyranny will the cura practice on\r\nthem, such as they are wont to practice if they have any power and\r\nauthority! How well the wedge of the same wood will force its way,\r\nwithout there being any one to say to him, curita facis? [i.e.,\r\n\"Dost thou play the cura?\"] [307]\r\n\r\n96. Therefore, if any insurrection or mutiny should arise, how well\r\ncould it be arranged and prepared, [308] if the cura entered also\r\ninto the dance, as he is also an Indian and interested? For, in all\r\nthe insurrections that have occurred in these islands, respect for\r\nthe father ministers has been of great importance; but the very\r\nopposite would have happened if these were Indians. Then in the\r\nfrequent carousals and feasts of which they are so fond, and on which\r\ntheir vanity and their chieftainship are founded, without any doubt\r\nthere would be great indecency; for the cura would be very tender\r\nof conscience who would not pledge them in their cups. In that and\r\nother temptations would happen what Lucian relates in the second of\r\nhis dialogues.\r\n\r\n97. A noble youth had a very beautiful and gentle female kitten,\r\nwhich he esteemed so highly that he begged the goddess Venus to change\r\nit into a beautiful maiden, in order that he might marry her. The\r\ngoddess did so. Thereupon, the youth [309] immediately arranged the\r\nwedding, to which he invited the best people of the city. While, then,\r\nthe bride was richly adorned with jewels and surrounded by many other\r\nwomen, [310] and the guests, a mouse happened to appear, and began to\r\napproach them in order to eat some crumbs of bread which were scattered\r\nabout. The bride saw it, and, without power to control herself, ran\r\nafter the mouse throughout the length of the hall, and the guests\r\nwere unable to restrain her. The groom was ashamed, and said, [311]\r\n\"Gentlemen, your pardon; for this girl was formerly a cat, and will\r\nalways have the habits and bad traits of that animal.\"\r\n\r\n98. I believe that the same thing would happen with the Indians,\r\n[312] even when they belong to the caciques or nobility; for it\r\nis incredible that they can strip themselves of the peculiarities\r\nof their nature. I at least do not believe it at present, although\r\nGod our Lord can very easily do it, for He is the One who raises up\r\nsons of Abraham from the stones. But we must not ask for miracles\r\nneedlessly, but allow the Indian to remain an Indian, and go to his\r\nlabor as before. If it is desired to prepare them for the high ministry\r\nof the priesthood, it is advisable to test them in the offices of\r\nalcaldes-mayor, captains, regidors, and councilors; for it appears\r\nto me that there is no one who can say that these said offices are\r\ngreater and of higher rank and dignity than the priesthood, at least\r\nwhere the Inquisition exists. Then, if they conduct themselves well\r\nin the said employments, they can be given the management of the body\r\nand blood of Jesus Christ our Lord; and then one can say with reason:\r\nQuia in pauca fuisti fidelis supra multa te constituam. [313] For,\r\nas the Church teaches us through the mouths of the holy fathers,\r\nthe dignity of the priesthood is so great that that of the kings or\r\nemperors of the world cannot compare with it. Thus says St. Ignatius\r\nthe Martyr in his epistle to Smyrna, chapter x, Sacerdotium est\r\napex bonorum omnium, quæ sunt in hominibus. [314] St. Ambrose, in\r\nchapter 2 of his book De dignitate sacerdotum [315] says so still\r\nmore clearly. [316] Father Molina [317] has considerable to say on\r\nthis in the first treatise of his Libro de sacerdotes [i.e., \"Book\r\nof priests\"] as has Father Señeri [318] in his Cura instruido [i.e.,\r\n\"the cura instructed\"].\r\n\r\n99. Then is it possible that, even though they are Catholics and\r\nfaithful sons of the Church, we must exalt to so lofty an estate\r\nmen against whom there would be so many complaints if they became\r\nalférezes of a company in the regiment of Manila? Can the sacred habit\r\nof St. Peter, which we religious venerate as that of the greatest\r\ndignity, and to which we yield the most honorable place--which, as\r\nsaid the patriarch of Antiochia [319] to the emperor of China, is\r\nthe first rank and order of the Church--be obliged not to experience\r\ndisgust at such low creatures? I do not know in what it [i.e., the\r\nproposal to ordain Indians] can consist, unless it be that in it\r\nis realized the vision that the said St. Peter had in Cesarea when\r\nthe sheet was let down from heaven filled with toads and serpents,\r\nand a voice commanded him to eat without disgust--as is read in\r\nchapter x of the Acts of the Apostles. For although it signified\r\nthe calling of heathendom, it must not be understood in moral things\r\nof the barbarous and mean nature of some peoples that compose that\r\nheathendom, in order to constitute the ecclesiastic hierarchy. [320]\r\nWhen I come to discuss this matter, I find no end, and I find that\r\nwe can only say: Domine adauge [nobis] fidem (Luke [x]vii, [5]). [321]\r\n\r\n100. It is also a fact that the sacred canons do not demand from\r\nthose who are ordained more than an honorable life and example,\r\nand a sufficient knowledge. Then, in order to dispense the spurious\r\nand legitimate [322] and the mestizos, there is a brief of Gregory\r\nXIII which begins \"Nuper ad nos relatum est,\" [323] issued at Roma,\r\nJanuary 25, one thousand five hundred and seventy-five. For all\r\nthat, I regard them [i.e., Indians as priests] as irregular, not\r\nonly for the reasons given and stated above, but also because they\r\nlack the ecclesiastical and priestly mental ability, and the prudence\r\nnecessary; and without these all the rest serves as almost nothing,\r\nas Pedro Urceolo sang with graceful elegance in his \"Epigrams:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sis licet ingenuus clarisque parentibus ortus;\r\n    Esse tamen vel sic bestia magna potes.\r\n    Adde docus patriæ et claros tibi sume propinquos;\r\n    Esse tamen vel sic bestia magna potes.\r\n    Sint tibi divitæ [324] sit larga et munda supellex;\r\n    Esse tamen vel sic bestia magna potes.\r\n    Denique, quidquid eris, nisi sit prudentia tecum;\r\n    Magna quidem dico, bestia semper eris. [325]\r\n\r\n\r\n101. May God our Lord preserve your Grace for the many years of my\r\ndesire. Manila, June 8, one thousand seven hundred and twenty.

The Filipino Indian is the embryo of nature and the offspring\r\nof grossness. He does not feel an insult or show gratitude for a\r\nkindness. His continual habitation is the kitchen; and the smoke that\r\nharms all of us serves him as the most refreshing breeze. If the Indian\r\nhas morisqueta and salt, he gives himself no concern, though it rain\r\nthunder and lightning, and the sky fall. He is much given to lying,\r\ntheft, and laziness. In the confessional he is a maze [embolismo]\r\nof contradictions, now denying proofs and now affirming impossible\r\nthings. Now he plays the part of a devout pilgrim over rough roads\r\nand through the deepest rivers, in order to hear mass on a workday\r\nat a shrine ten or twelve leguas away; while it is necessary to use\r\nviolence to get him to hear mass on Sunday in his parish church. They\r\nare impious in their necessities with the father, but liberal and\r\ncharitable to their guests, even when they do not know them; and\r\nthrough that they are greatly disappointed. At the same time they are\r\nhumble and proud; bold and atrocious, but cowardly and pusillanimous;\r\ncompassionate and cruel; slothful and lazy, and diligent; careful and\r\nnegligent in their own affairs; very dull and foolish for good things,\r\nbut very clever and intelligent in rogueries. He who has most to do\r\nwith them knows them least. Their greatest diversion is cock-fighting,\r\nand they love their cocks more than their wives and children. They are\r\nmore ready to believe any of their old people than even an apostolic\r\npreacher. They resemble mellizas, [328] in their vices and opposite\r\nvirtues. In lying alone, is no contradiction found in them; for one\r\ndoes not know when they are not lying, whether they are telling the\r\ntruth by mistake. One Indian does not resemble another Indian, or\r\neven himself. If they are given one thing, they immediately ask for\r\nanother. [329] They never fail to deceive, unless it crosses their\r\nown interest. In their suits, they are like flies on the food, who\r\nnever quit it, however much they be brushed away. Finally, there is\r\nno fixed rule by which to construe them; a new syntax is necessary\r\nfor each one; and, as they are all anomalous, the most intelligent\r\nman would be distracted [330] if he tried to define them. Farewell.\r\n\r\n[Delgado has the following interesting chapter (pp. 297-302 of his\r\nHistoria) on this letter, which it is judged advisable to present at\r\nthis place.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    Some considerations concerning the matter in Father Gaspar\r\n    de San Agustín's letter\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess that I read this letter, in which the reverend author\r\ncriticises the customs and dispositions of the natives of Filipinas,\r\nsome years ago. But I read it as I am wont to read other letters, for\r\ndiversion and amusement, without thinking much about its artfulness,\r\nand I was delighted with its erudition. However, when I afterward\r\nconsidered its contents with some degree of thought, I saw that it\r\nbrought forward, in its whole length, no solid proof of what it\r\ntries to make one believe; and it appeared to me a hyperbolical\r\ncriticism from the very beginning. On that account I resolved to\r\nmake a few brief commentaries on the matter in the letter, both for\r\nthe consolation of those whom our Lord may call to these missions,\r\nand so that it may be understood that at times sadness and melancholy\r\nare accustomed to heighten things, making giants out of pygmies--all\r\nthe more, if a relish for revery and grumbling be joined with a\r\ntendency to exaggeration and with figures of speech corresponding\r\nthereto. Consequently, I am surprised that the reverend annalist or\r\nchronicler [i.e., San Antonio] of the seraphic province of San Gregorio\r\npraises this letter, saying that it is worth printing, since its author\r\nhas penetrated as far as one may penetrate into the characters of the\r\nnatives of these islands. And yet the author confesses that it is as\r\ndifficult to define their nature as are the eight impossible things\r\nwhich are recounted there. That seems to me a fine hyperbole.\r\n\r\nFrom the above one can see that, as he commenced this letter by\r\naffirming a hyperbole with eight hyperboles, it is not surprising that\r\nI called it hyperbolical; and especially if all the hyperboles that it\r\ncontains from its beginning to its end be enumerated. But ere I begin\r\nto express my opinion I would like to sum up two contradictory and\r\nopposite expressions that I find in these authors. The reverend father\r\nFray Gaspar says of the Indians, in his letter, that the difficulty\r\nof knowing the Indians lies not in the individual but in the race,\r\nfor, if one be known, all are known.\r\n\r\nFather Pedro Murillo says, in his approbation of the Cronicas, [331]\r\nthat \"there is no fixed rule by which to construe the Indians; for\r\neach one needs a new syntax, all being anomalous. With the Indians\r\nthe argument does not conclude by induction, since no one is like to\r\nhimself; for, in the short circuit of a day, he changes into more\r\ncolors than a chameleon, takes more shapes than a Proteus, and has\r\nmore movements than a Euripus. [332] He who has most to do with them,\r\nknows them least. In short, they are an aggregate of contrarieties,\r\nand the best logician cannot reconcile them. They are an obscure and\r\nconfused chaos, in which no species can be perceived and no points\r\nof exactness distinguished.\" All these terms considered one by one,\r\ncompose a very exaggerated hyperbole, in which this author showed his\r\ngreat erudition and little experience, for he only ministered in a few\r\nmissions, and for a short time. For during most of the time while he\r\nlived in these islands he did not leave the professor's chair, except\r\nfor a short time; and all that he tells of his journey to and travels\r\namong the Visayas was learned in passing and hastily, in company\r\nwith the provincial who visited those missions. There he obtained\r\nvery little light on the character and temperament of the Indians,\r\nas he had no dealings with them as one settled among them. And, just\r\nas in this expression he opposes himself without much reason to the\r\nreverend father Fray Gaspar, who after forty years of ministry, affirms\r\nthat the Indians are well designated by the Greek word monopantas--a\r\nterm which was given to a certain people by a critic, as they were all\r\nsimilar and homogeneous--so also when he affirms that all are anomalous\r\nand heterogeneous because they cannot all be constructed in one and\r\nthe same syntax, does he go beyond the credence that can be given to\r\nhis ingenious hyperboles. The experience that the said Father Murillo\r\ncould have is of the Indians who go about in Manila and its environs,\r\nwho are interpreters, servants in accounting-rooms and secretarial\r\noffices, who are accustomed to deal with Spaniards of all kinds, with\r\ncreoles, mestizos, Sangleys, and other kinds of people who assemble\r\nthere for trade. They have learned fraud and deceit, as well as the\r\nbad morals and propensities of all and every one of them. As is seen,\r\none cannot judge of a whole nation--and much less of all the nations\r\nof the islands, who are diverse and distinct in genius and customs\r\nby the cases of these Indians who speak Spanish. And taking into\r\naccount so great diversity, I affirm that it is impossible to find\r\na definition that admits and includes all of them. For these persons\r\nwhom I have mentioned, reared among so many classes, and among people\r\nso heterogeneous, and who are imbued with customs so diverse, cannot\r\nform rules by which to explain their own nation, much less by which\r\nto define the other nations.\r\n\r\nNow if the statements of authors in regard to physical or moral matters\r\nare so at variance that we can say that each author has a different\r\nopinion--as says the proverb, Quot capita, tot sententiæ--and if\r\nthus far no ground and certain point has been found at which the\r\nunderstanding may stop, how is it strange that they do not find,\r\nin order to describe Indians with customs so unusual and artificial\r\nas have those of Manila, a compound idea made up of all that they\r\nhave learned from the Spaniard, both good and evil; all that they\r\nhave learned from the Guachinango; [333] and what they have learned\r\nfrom the mestizo, the Sangley, the Moro, the Malabar, the Cafre, and\r\nall the other people with whom they have intercourse and with whom\r\nthey trade? Granting this to be true, it appears that the definition\r\nof Father Murillo fits these Spanish-speaking Indians, but not the\r\nothers, who have not had any intercourse with diverse classes of\r\npeople. On this account it seems to me that father Fray Gaspar hit\r\nthe definition exactly, when he said in his letter that the Asiatic\r\nIndians of Filipinas are almost the same as all the people of the\r\nnations of Eastern India, in what concerns their genius, disposition,\r\nand inclination; and are not distinguished one from another except in\r\ntheir rites, clothing, and languages. I add, in what regards their\r\nabilities and capacities--which are so good, and in general so well\r\ninclined--that I believe that if children, either boys or girls,\r\nwere taken from Filipinas to Viscaya or to Castilla, the natives\r\n[of those countries] would not distinguish them from the Vizcainos,\r\nCastilians, or mountaineers. For their vices are not due so much\r\nto their nature, as to their bad rearing and education; and they are\r\neasily instructed both in the evil and in the good. And notwithstanding\r\nwhat father Fray Gaspar, Father Murillo, and Fray Juan [Francisco]\r\nde San Antonio have said, they would have been more successful had\r\nthey not said, with exaggeration, that it would be impossible to\r\nwrite everything that they have observed of the Indians, on all the\r\npaper that is found in China. That is a hyperbole that transcends all\r\nfaith. Thus does he continue in all that he says; and he affirms,\r\nfurther, that it surpasses all that we can touch with the hands or\r\nsee with the eyes. Hence from the beginning we can state those two\r\nrules of law: semel malus, semper præsumitur malus; and the other,\r\nmalum ex quocumque defectu. [334]...\r\n\r\nWhat mystery is there in the customs and genius of the Indians\r\nthat should make them so deep and inscrutable that we cannot reach\r\nthem, sound them, and explain them? since they are Indians like all\r\nthe rest of the people of Asia, without there being more or less\r\nin them. Therefore, \"these profundities, this intricate, confused\r\nchaos, this aggregate of contrarieties, this maze of contradictions,\r\nare a collection of rhetorical locutions or tropes invented in\r\norder to exaggerate and to use hyperboles in what of itself has\r\nno mystery--these definitions remaining purely in the manner of\r\nspeech, or of the conception, of their authors; or perhaps in a mere\r\nmisapprehension formed by a critical, melancholy, or affected genius.\r\n\r\nBut since in this letter, the evil propensities of the Indians, both\r\nmen and lads, who act as servants, are set down in detail, let us see\r\non the other hand, somewhat of the good that the Indians possess. For\r\none should not write and consider only the evil, and omit as fitting\r\nall the good, in order thereby to make the object more detestable. For,\r\nas says a mystical writer, we must not possess the nature of the\r\ndung-beetle, which goes always to the dungheap, but that of the bee,\r\nwhich always seeks out the sweet and pleasant. Let us see what Father\r\nMurillo says of the good: \"They are most clever in any handiwork, not\r\nin inventing but in imitating what they see. They are most beautiful\r\nwriters; and there are many tailors and barbers among them. They are\r\nexcellent embroiderers, painters, goldsmiths, and engravers, whose\r\nburin has not the like in all the Indias (and I was even about to\r\npass farther if shame did not restrain me), as is seen clearly in the\r\nmany good engravings that they make daily. They are good sculptors,\r\ngilders, and carpenters. They make the water craft of these islands,\r\nthe galleys, pataches, and ships of the Acapulco line. They act as\r\nsailors, artillery-men, and divers; for there is scarce an Indian\r\nwho cannot swim excellently. They are the under-pilots of these\r\nseas. They are very expert in making bejuquillos, [335] which are\r\ngold chains of a very delicate and exquisite workmanship. They make\r\nhats, petates or rugs, and mats, from palm-leaves, rattan, and nito,\r\n[336] which are very beautiful, and embroidered with various kinds of\r\nflowers and figures. They are remarkable mechanics and puppet-showmen,\r\nand they make complicated mechanisms which, by means of figures, go\r\nthrough various motions with propriety and accuracy. There are some\r\njewelers. They make powder, and cast swivel-guns, cannon, and bells. I\r\nhave seen them make guns as fine as those of Europa. There are three\r\nprinting houses in Manila, and all have Indian workmen. They have great\r\nability in music. There is no village however small, that has not its\r\nsuitable band of musicians for the services of the Church. They have\r\nexcellent voices--sopranos, contraltos, tenors, and basses. Almost\r\nall of them can play the harp, and there are many violinists, rebeck,\r\noboe, and flute players. The most remarkable thing is, that not only\r\ndo those whose trade it is make those instruments; but various Indians\r\nmake guitars, flutes, harps, and violins, for pleasure, with their\r\nbolos and machetes. And by the mere seeing those instruments played,\r\nthey learn them almost without any teaching; and the same thing occurs\r\nin other things. On this account it is said that the Indians have\r\ntheir understanding in their eyes, since they imitate whatever they\r\nsee, by another like it.\" This is what Father Murillo says; but he\r\nleft the most important things in the inkhorn. I will add them here,\r\nas I have heard them affirmed many times by the Spaniards in Cavite,\r\nnamely: Who are the men who convey and conduct the ships and galleons\r\nfrom Acapulco and other kingdoms? Is it the Spaniards? Ask that of\r\nthe pilots, masters, and boatswains, and they will all affirm that\r\nthis great and inestimable good is due to the Indian alone. (Here is\r\nindeed where a hyperbole will fit exactly.) Besides this, who are\r\nthe people who support us in these lands and those who furnish us\r\nfood? Perhaps the Spaniards dig, harvest, and plant throughout the\r\nislands? Of a surety, no; for when they arrive at Manila, they are\r\nall gentlemen. The Indians are the ones who plow the lands, who sow\r\nthe rice, who keep it clear [of weeds], who tend it, who harvest it,\r\nwho thrash it out with their feet--and not only the rice which is\r\nconsumed in Manila, but that throughout the Filipinas--and there is no\r\none in all the islands who can deny me that. Besides this, who cares\r\nfor the cattle-ranches? The Spaniards? Certainly not. The Indians\r\nare the ones who care for, and manage and tend the sheep and cattle\r\nby which the Spaniards are supported. Who rears the swine? Is it not\r\nthe same Indians? Who cultivates the fruits--the bananas, cacao, and\r\nall the other fruits of the earth? of which there is always abundance\r\nin the islands, unless unfavorable weather, locusts, or some other\r\naccident cause their loss? Who provide Manila and the Spaniards with\r\noil? Is it not the poor Visayan Indians, who bring it in their vessels\r\nannually? Who furnishes so great profit to the Spaniards in Manila\r\nwith the balate [337] and sigay; and who buys these products very\r\ncheaply from the wretched Indians, and resell them for double the sum\r\nto the pataches of the coast and to the Sangleys? Who guide and convey\r\nus to the villages and missions, and serve us as guides, sailors, and\r\npilots? Perhaps it is the Spaniards? No, it is the Indians themselves,\r\nwith their so exaggerated, magnified, and heightened laziness. Is\r\nthis the thanks that we give them, when we are conquering them in\r\ntheir own lands, and have made ourselves masters in them, and are\r\nserved by them almost as by slaves? We ought to give God our Lord many\r\nthanks, because He maintains us only through the affection and by the\r\nuseful labors of the Indians in this land; and He would perhaps have\r\nalready driven us hence if it were not for this usefulness of theirs,\r\nand for the salvation of the Indians. We also owe many thanks to the\r\nIndians, since God our Lord sustains us in their lands by their means;\r\nand because we would die of starvation if they did not sustain us,\r\nprovide us with food, serve us, and conduct us through the islands\r\nwith so much love and security that they would all first perish before\r\nthe father in whatever perils arise.\r\n\r\nThese and many other like things were overlooked by Father Murillo, who\r\nwas enraptured by their music, engraving, and rugs. By the aforesaid,\r\none will see with how little truth the statement is printed that the\r\nIndians are the greatest enemies that the father ministers have;\r\nfor certainly all the above could not be reconciled with such a\r\nproposition. On the contrary, it must be said that the Indians are\r\nthose who defend us from our enemies; for, in the presidios, who are\r\nthe soldiers, who sail in the war fleets, who are in the vanguard\r\nin war? Could the Spaniards, perchance, maintain themselves alone\r\nin this country, if the Indians did not aid in everything? Little\r\nexperience and less reflection would he have who should propose\r\nsuch a thing. Therefore, these two things do not harmonize well,\r\nthat those who hate us should defend us, and that those who are our\r\ngreatest enemies should be the ones to maintain and support us. Nor\r\nis it to be wondered at that there have been insurrections on several\r\noccasions; these, perhaps, have not arisen because the Indians were\r\nill-disposed to the Spaniards; but, on the contrary, we know that\r\nmany of them have been caused by the cruelty, wickedness, and tyranny\r\nof some alcalde-mayor and other Spaniards who, having been elevated\r\nfrom low beginnings, try to become gods and kings in the provinces,\r\ntyrannizing over the Indians and their possessions. This is often the\r\ncause of the insurrections. Would that I could mention some especial\r\ncases in this matter. However, I do not care to dip my pen in blood,\r\nand write tragedies instead of history. For, although I could say\r\nmore, the authority and arrogance that every Spaniard assumes upon\r\nhis arrival in this country is incredible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIVE PEOPLES AND THEIR CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\n[San Antonio, [338] in his Cronicas (Manila, 1738-44), i, pp. 129-172,\r\nhas the following ethnological matter. We omit the side heads.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n    Of the origin of the Indians\r\n\r\n\r\n[After a brief allusion to the creation of man at the beginning of\r\nthe world, the writer continues:]\r\n\r\n384. Now, then, I have said as much as there is to say of the origin\r\nof the Indians, if we speak of the first and most remote. For to\r\nendeavor to determine the first settlers of these lands, whence and\r\nhow they came, whether they were Carthaginians, Jews, Spaniards,\r\nPhoenicians, Greeks, Chinese, Tartars, etc., is reserved for God,\r\nwho knows everything; and this task exceeds all human endeavor. And\r\nif such study obtain anything, it will amount only to a few fallible\r\nconjectures--with danger of the judgment, and without any advance of\r\nthe truth or of reputation. And such is the notion (omitting many\r\nother absurdities that have been written), that the Indians were\r\nproduced ex putre like unclean animals, or like the wild plants of the\r\nfield. Others showing them great favor, assign the sun as their father,\r\nwhich produced them from some noble material. Others say [that they\r\nwere produced] by the ingenious art of chemists or magicians; others\r\nthat there were two Adams in the world, one in Asia, and another in\r\nthe Western Indias, and that our Indians proceeded from one of them;\r\nothers, that there were already people in the world before the creation\r\nof Adam; and that from them came the heathen, and from Adam, the\r\nHebrews. All of the above, being so erroneous nonsense, and blindness\r\nfrom the devil, is already refuted, and is well refuted with contempt.\r\n\r\n385. The only conjecture that can be made with some more visible\r\nfoundation is the origin of our Indians, considering those who were\r\nfound in these islands at the time of the conquest by the Spanish\r\narms. In accordance with this, I shall relate what written records\r\nI have found (which is very little), and what I have carefully\r\ninvestigated, which will not be much, for the natives are not very\r\ncapable of forming adequate accounts of this subject, and what we\r\nEuropeans are reducing to treatises.\r\n\r\n386. Father Colin (both learned and curious in the investigation of the\r\nmatter which we are treating) reduces the people found in this land\r\nby our first conquistadors into three different classes. The first\r\nclass consisted of those who ruled and governed as absolute masters;\r\nand these were civilized after their own fashion. The second consisted\r\nof black and barbarous mountaineers who inhabited the tops of the\r\nmountains, like brutes. The third consisted of men neither so barbaric\r\nnor so civilized as the other two classes; for, although they lived\r\nin retirement, they did not hate civilization and human intercourse.\r\n\r\n387. This third class still remains in the same ancient condition. They\r\nlive, as a rule, on the plateaus of the mountains, and at the\r\nmouths of rivers, and maintain themselves by hunting and fishing,\r\nand some agriculture. Most of them trade, and barter wax with the\r\nvillages. These people are called Zimarrònes, Zambals, Ylàgas, Tìngues,\r\nTagabaloòyes, [339] Manòbos, Mangyànes, and various other names,\r\naccording to the difference of the sites where they live. Some or\r\nothers of these have become Christians, through the efforts of the\r\nnear-by evangelical ministers. The rest are heathen, but they have\r\nno determined rites, and are governed only by the customs of their\r\nancestors, and those customs are mostly barbaric. Some of these\r\npeople are accustomed to pay some sort of recognition or feudal due\r\nto our Catholic monarch, who is thereby bound to defend them from\r\nthe invasions of their neighboring enemies. Such is done by the\r\nTagabaloòyes in the province of Caràga, who pay their annual feudal\r\ndue in guinàras and medriñaques (textiles of abacá), [340] in order to\r\nbe defended from the Moros their neighbors. Likewise the Mangyànes of\r\nMindôro (who number about seven thousand), who pay fifty-two arrobas\r\nand a half of wax annually, or 105 tributes; and some of the Manòbos in\r\nthe mountains of Caràga (who are heathen and without number, although\r\nsome are Christians--a people civilized and well inclined to work,\r\nwho have [fixed] habitation and excellent houses)--pay tribute.\r\n\r\n388. The origin of all these people (who are scattered throughout these\r\nislands) is inferred to be either the many civilized Indians who have\r\nretreated to the mountains in order not to pay tribute, or in order not\r\nto be chastised for any crime; or the many different nations immediate\r\nto this archipelago. For some bear traces of being Japanese mestizos,\r\nas do the Tagabaloòyes, as I am well informed by religious who have\r\nhad intercourse with them. Some are known to proceed from the Chinese;\r\nsome from pure Indians, and some from other nations, as is declared\r\nby the circumstances of face, body, color, hair, customs, manner,\r\nand behavior--according to the experience of various religious, who\r\nagree that they are not of the pure race of the Indians, but mestizos\r\nas above stated. And even in five clans of Mangyànes who are said\r\nto exist in the island of Mindòro, there is one which has a little\r\ntail, as do the monkeys; and many religious who have assured me of\r\nit, as witnesses. In Valèr, on the coast opposite us, a woman was\r\nfound not long ago who had a long tail, as was told me by the present\r\nmissionary; and he was unable to be sure of the origin of that race,\r\nunless it was a race of Jews.\r\n\r\n389. I do not know whether those people who are found only in\r\nthe environs of Manila, and are called Criollos Morenos [i.e.,\r\ncreole blacks], can be put in this mestizo class. The former are\r\nall oldtime Christians, docile, well inclined, and of sufficient\r\nunderstanding. They serve the king in personal duties, and always\r\nhave their regiment of soldiers, with their master-of-camp, captains,\r\nand other leaders; and in this way they are outside the reckoning as\r\nIndians. It is difficult to assign their true origin to them. For\r\nsome make them the descendants of those blacks, of whom we shall\r\nspeak later, who were the primitive lords of these domains. But I do\r\nnot see how this can be so, for they do not resemble those Negrillos\r\neither in their hair or in the members of their bodies, or in the\r\nqualities of their minds, in which these creoles have the complete\r\nadvantage. And although it might be said that they have been bettered\r\nin all ways with the lapse of time, and the change of location to\r\none more civilized and temperate, it is not credible that they would\r\nnot retain some of their old vices, as is the case with various other\r\nraces here, and as has been experienced in Nueva España. Some people\r\nmake them the descendants of those slaves who were formerly held here\r\nby the petty rulers, brought by foreign traders in exchange for the\r\ndrugs that formed their commerce and with whose price they made a\r\ngood profit. Even yet they bring to our settlements a considerable\r\nnumber--so many, that it is necessary for one of the auditors to be\r\njudge of the slaves, and his duty costs him his time and patience. The\r\ncreoles refuse to confess this origin, and it does not seem to me\r\nthat they would be so well received and so well regarded if they\r\nhad so vile an origin. Some believe that they descend from the free\r\nMalabars who come to these islands under pretext of trade. I incline\r\nmore to this view, paying heed to the physiognomies and intellect of\r\nthem all, for they are almost all alike in their clear dark color,\r\naquiline noses, animated eyes, lank hair, docile disposition, and\r\ngood manners, by which we may infer that those that there are now\r\nare Malabar and Indian mestizos.\r\n\r\n390. At the present time, all this archipelago, and especially these\r\nislands of the Tagálogs, are full of another race of mestizos, who\r\nwere not found at the first discovery, whom we call Sangley mestizos,\r\n[341] who are descended from Indian women and Chinese men. For since\r\ntrade with them [i.e., the Sangleys] has been, and is, so frequent,\r\nand so many remain in these islands under pretext of trade, and they\r\nare the ones who supply these islands with clothing, food, and other\r\nproducts, those who have mixed with the Indian women in marriage are\r\nnumerous; and for this purpose they become Christians, and from them\r\nhave resulted so many mestizos that one cannot count them. They are all\r\nChristians, and quite commonly well disposed, and very industrious and\r\ncivilized. They take pride in imitating the Europeans in everything,\r\nbut their imitation is only a copy. They inhabit the same villages\r\nwith the Tagálogs, but are not reckoned with them; since for the\r\nreckoning of the king they belong to a different body. The women are\r\nmore like the Sangleys or Chinese, but the men not so much; however,\r\nthese inherit from them ambition, in their continual industry.\r\n\r\n391. There is also another kind of mestizo--the Japanese--who result\r\nfrom the Japanese who were shipwrecked on these islands in former\r\nyears. They are of better conduct than the others, since they have a\r\nbetter origin. They are more esteemed here and have more privileges,\r\nfor they only pay half as much tribute as do the others.\r\n\r\n392. It is tradition that the Negrillos, who belong to the second\r\nclass of people whom our first conquistadors found, were the first\r\nowners of the islands of this archipelago; and that, the civilized\r\nnations of other kingdoms having conquered them, they fled to the\r\nmountains and settled there, and from there it has never been possible\r\nto exterminate them, because their sites are impenetrable. There\r\nthey have lived and brought forth children until the present. In\r\nformer times they were so elated with their primitive power that,\r\nalthough their forces were not able to cope with those of foreigners\r\nin the open, they were very powerful in the thickets, mountains, and\r\nmouths of the rivers; and were accustomed to burst like an avalanche\r\nupon the villages, and compel their inhabitants to pay them tribute,\r\nas if they were the lords of the land, who were inhabiting it. And if\r\nthe people refused to give it willingly, they killed right and left,\r\ncollecting the tribute in the heads of those who were decapitated; as\r\nwas written by one of our oldtime religious in the following words:\r\n\"Even in my time, it happens,\" he says, \"that they descended to\r\nthe settlements and sought tribute from the Tagálogs, and at times\r\ntook some heads for this purpose. Thus did it happen in Sinilòan,\r\nwhich refused tribute at the approach of the Spaniards. The mountain\r\nIndians, having revolted, attacked the village; and they took three\r\nheads, and badly wounded a Spaniard who was defending them.\" Thus far\r\nthe religious. At other times those people did not allow the Indians\r\nto make use of the wood and game of the mountains, and the fish of\r\nthe rivers. For being very skilful in the use of the bow and arrow,\r\nand very swift and experienced in the fastnesses of the mountains and\r\nthickets, they inhumanly shot with arrows as many as approached their\r\nterritories, without anyone catching sight or sound of them. For that\r\nreason, the inhabitants of the villages consider it wise to make an\r\nagreement with the Negrillos to pay them a certain tribute, provided\r\nthat the latter leave the rivers and fields free. And although this\r\npact is not so apparent at present, I believe that it is practiced\r\nsecretly because of the fear that the Indians have of them, and\r\nbecause of their dependence on them; since the Negrillos are the\r\nlords of the mountains which contain the most virgin forests, with\r\nwoods of the greatest value. It is a fact, too, that those of the\r\npresent day are as barbarous as their ancestors.\r\n\r\n393. All of these people are black negroes, most of whom have kinky\r\nhair, and very few have lank. They are flat-nosed, and almost all of\r\nthem have thick, projecting lips. They go totally naked, and only\r\nhave their privies covered with some coverings resembling linen\r\ncloths, which they draw on from the back forward, and which are\r\ncalled bahaques. They make those bahaques from the bark of trees,\r\npounded with heavy blows, so that there are some that look like fine\r\nlinen. Wrapping a rattan around the waist, they fasten the bahaque\r\nto it by the two ends. As ornaments they wear certain bracelets of\r\nrattan of various colors, curiously wrought; and garlands on their\r\nheads and on the fleshy parts of their arms, composed of various\r\nflowers and branches; and as a means of greater distinction for some\r\none person, a cock's feather or the feather of some other bird, as\r\na plume. Their food consists of fruits, and roots of the mountain;\r\nand if they find, perchance, some deer, they eat it in that place\r\nwhere they kill it. That night they make their abode there, and after\r\nthey grow tired of dancing, they sleep there--all helter-skelter,\r\nlike brutes. Next day the same thing happens, and they sleep in\r\nanother stopping-place. All their customs are the savage and brutish\r\nones characteristic of barbarians; and they recognize no other laws,\r\nletters, or government than those of the heads of their families,\r\nat the most. They only care about defending their own territories,\r\nupon which they have lively wars, some Negrillos against others,\r\nwith great mortality on both sides. At such times no natives dare\r\nenter the mountains, for the Negrillos kill them all, whether friend\r\nor enemy. Their most common arms are shield, bow, and arrow. If by a\r\nmiracle any Christian is found among these people, and if perhaps the\r\nreligious have reared some of them in Christianity from childhood,\r\nit very rarely occurs that he does not flee to the mountains whence\r\nhe originated, when he becomes grown.\r\n\r\n394. One of the islands of this archipelago which has a name, is the\r\none called the island of Negros, because of the abundance of those\r\npeople. It is located between the two islands of Zebú and Panày, and\r\nin it is established a Christian and civilized government. But at one\r\npoint of this island, which lies toward the west, and is called the\r\npoint of Sojotòn, there is a great number of the said blacks, and not\r\none Christian. In the center of the island is a much greater number;\r\ntherefore, it is along the beach where the Jesuit fathers and the\r\nseculars administer, and where the Visayans or Pintados are settled.\r\n\r\n395. The origin of these Negrillos is thought to have been interior\r\nIndia, or citra Gangen, which was called Etyopia; for it was settled\r\nby Ethiopian negroes, whence went out the settlers to African Etyopia,\r\nas Father Colin proves in detail. Consequently, there being on the\r\nmainland of India nations of negroes, and even in Nueva Guinea so many\r\nthat their first discoverers gave the island that name because of the\r\nmultitude of these people; and since the distance from those places\r\nto these islands and the Philippine archipelago is not great; nor was\r\nthe land [of Nueva Guinea] which was five hundred leguas in length,\r\nentirely settled with blacks--whom the ships of Viceroy Don Antonio\r\nde Mendoza found in one of the capes of the strait of Magallanes:\r\nthose blacks could very easily pass from one island to another, and\r\ntheir chief abode with their own name might be the island of Negros,\r\nas we have remarked. Thence they could extend afterward to dominate\r\nand settle the rest of the islands, without any opposition from other\r\npeople, until the opposition came through other men more rational\r\nand civilized than they, who dispossessed them.\r\n\r\n396. The third kind of people whom our Spaniards found in this\r\narchipelago were the civilized nations, who maintained their government\r\nor seigniory on the river banks, on the seashores, and in the other\r\nsites with the best locations in these regions, and in the locations\r\nmost fit for healthful and safe dwelling-places. Among them there was\r\nanother remarkable class of people, and their domination, scattered\r\nthroughout the many islands of this archipelago, the chief of whom are\r\nthe Tagálogs, Pampangos, Visayans, and Mindanaos. Other peoples are\r\nreduced to these, although they have various distinguishing marks. The\r\nTagálogs, who are the natives of Manila and its archbishopric, with\r\nbut little distance between their villages, were Malays, who came\r\nfrom a district called Malàyo; that is the origin of all the Malays,\r\nwho are scattered throughout the most and the better parts of all\r\nthese archipelagoes. They are located on the mainland of Malâca,\r\nand as that district is not far distant from the great island of\r\nBornèy, it is inferred (and this tradition has been handed down from\r\nfather to son), that the Malays went to Bornèy, and from Bornèy to\r\nsettle Manila and its district; taking the name of Tagàlog--which\r\nis the same as Taga Ylog, which signifies, in their own language,\r\n\"those who live on the rivers;\" for the Tagálogs have always lived\r\non the shores of the rivers.\r\n\r\n397. That the Tagálogs originated directly from the Malays, is proved\r\n(in the opinion of all) by their language, which differs but little\r\nfrom that of the real Malays; by their color, and the shape of their\r\nfaces and their bodies; by the clothes and vesture in which the Spanish\r\nconquistadors found them; by their customs and ceremonies, all of which\r\nresemble those of the Malays--of whom the Tagálogs themselves said,\r\nand say always, that they are the true descendants. The coming of\r\nthe Malays to this archipelago is not incredible, as we have so many\r\nexamples of various accidents in these seas which have originated from\r\nthe weather, by which we have seen brought to these islands unknown\r\npeoples, who spoke languages which no one could understand. For\r\ninstance, a boat driven from its course, landed in the year 1725\r\non the opposite coast of Valèr and Casigùran, where our religious\r\nwere in charge; it contained more than twenty men, whose language or\r\ngarb had not been known until that time. But it is much more easily\r\ncredible that the Malays came to these islands led by greed for their\r\ncommercial profits--as, one reads in the histories of the Portuguese,\r\nhappened in the regions of India with the Persians and Arab Moros,\r\nwho, having entered under the pretext of trade, afterwards became\r\nmasters of everything. The same thing is said here of the entrance\r\nof the Moro Malays.\r\n\r\n398. The Pampangos (according to tradition) originated from the\r\nlargest island of the Orient, which is that of Sumàtra or Trapobàna\r\n(although some apply the latter name to Zeilàn), which is located below\r\nthe line. That island is seven hundred leguas in circumference, and is\r\nnear the land of Malâca and Malâyo, and for that reason it is included\r\nin the Aurea Chersonesus. In the midst of that great island of Sumàtra\r\nthere is a large lake, on whose surrounding marge many different\r\npeoples have their abodes. According to Father Colin (who himself\r\nexamined him), a Pampango who had lost his way reached that place;\r\nand, having discovered that there were men there of his own build,\r\nlanguage, and clothing, approached, and entered into conversation with\r\nthem in his own elegant Pampango tongue. They answered him in the\r\nsame speech, and one of their old men said: \"You are descendants of\r\nthe lost people who, in former times, left here to settle other lands,\r\nand have never been heard of since.\" From this it appears that one may\r\ninfer the origin of the Pampangos. But it is not easy to determine\r\nwhether they came from Sumàtra direct, or settled first in Bornèy,\r\nbecause of the nearness of its lands and domains, and thence passed on\r\nto settle the islands of this archipelago; although it appears from\r\nthe statements of some who have been in Bornèy for a time that they\r\neven find there sufficient indications that the Pampangos originated,\r\nsome from Sumàtra and others from Malâyo. It is certain that if\r\nthe island of Bornèy was not a land continuous with that of these\r\nislands in past centuries (and arguments are not lacking for this),\r\nat least many islets are found lying in a row and near one another,\r\nwith which Bornèy is closely connected. [342] Such a one is Paragua,\r\nwhich extends in a northerly direction. Toward the east, Bornèy is\r\nextended by Mindanào. With this continuation and the short distances\r\nbetween these regions, one can see the little difficulty in changing\r\ntheir abodes from one to the other; and it is believable that the\r\nTagálogs, Pampangos, and other civilized races who were found in\r\nthis archipelago, and who were almost alike in language, customs,\r\nbodily proportions, and clothing, as now we see them, came immediately\r\nfrom Bornèy, some from some provinces and some from others. That may\r\naccount for the little difference that is found among them.\r\n\r\n399. It is argued that the Visayans and Pintados--who are the\r\nones found in the Camàrines, Lèyte, Samàr, Panày, Zebù, and other\r\nneighboring territories--came from the large island of Macasàr,\r\nwhich is very powerful and densely populated. It has its emperor,\r\nwho is called Sumbanco, and many petty rulers. The basis of this\r\nargument lies, not only in the short distance from that island to\r\nthis archipelago, for it is only distant about sixty leguas from the\r\npoint of Samboànga; but also because in Macasàr, as is reported, there\r\nare Indians who adorn and tattoo the body as do the Visayans (who are\r\ncalled Pintados on that account). But it is not known with certainty\r\nwhere one and the other originated. We only know of a relation written\r\nby the chief pilot, Pedro Fernandez de Quiròs, of his voyage to the\r\nSalomon Islands and their discovery by Albaro de Mendaña de Neyra in\r\nthe year 1595. That relation is addressed to Doctor Antonio de Morga,\r\nlieutenant-general for his Majesty of the Philipinas. The said Quiròs\r\nsays in it that, finding themselves in ten long degrees south latitude,\r\nthey sighted an island to which General Don Albaro gave the name\r\nof La Magdalena; and that from its port there came to receive them,\r\nhe says, \"with seventy ships, more than four hundred white Indians,\r\nof a very fine symmetry, tall, lusty, and robust, and so well built\r\nthat they far surpassed us. They had fine teeth, eyes, mouth, the most\r\nbeautiful hands and feet, and long hair. Many of them were very fair;\r\nand among them were the must handsome youths, all naked, and without\r\ncovering over any part; and all their bodies, legs, arms, hands, and\r\nin some the faces, were adorned as among these Visayans.\" From this\r\nit is evident that they are Pintados Indians; and that they were not\r\nconquered, like those whom we call here Pintados Visayans. They live\r\nin south latitude, in the same parallel as that of the north, from\r\nten to twelve degrees. But it is not easy to determine what might\r\nbe the origin of the others; since, although it is known that this\r\ncustom of tattooing and making figures on the body is found in Brasil,\r\nin Florida, among the Scythians of Asia, and the Britons of Europa,\r\nand even among the Moros of Africa, those nations are very remote from\r\nour Pintados; and so remote an origin cannot be conceded to the latter.\r\n\r\n400. The large island of Mindanao took its name from a large lake\r\n(which is called Danào in the general language of these islands)\r\nwhich is found in that island, and into which many rivers flow. The\r\nsame thing has happened in that island as I have said of the others,\r\nnamely, that its first owners and settlers must have been the\r\nones who are now found on the uplands and in the fastnesses of the\r\nmountains and the crags. Since they are inclined to the mountains,\r\nthey allowed the foreign traders to settle their seacoasts and rivers,\r\nas they were found uninhabited and defenseless; and when the latter\r\nhad taken possession of the best of the territories and districts,\r\nthe true owners were unable to expel the foreigners, since the latter\r\nwere the more powerful and civilized.\r\n\r\n401. From this fact comes the variety of tribes that have been found\r\nin that island of Mindanào: such as the Caragas, the Butuans, the\r\nCagayans, the Dapitans, the Mindanaos, the Malanaos, besides the\r\nTagabaloòyes, Manòbos, and Lutàos, and a great number of blacks,\r\nlike those of whom we have already written. Of all of them, when\r\nwe consider their first origin, there is no other inference than\r\nthat it was in the neighboring islands of Bornèy, Macasàr, or the\r\nMalùcas, considering not only the Mahometan rites and their manner\r\nof dressing, but also the bonds of sympathy existing among them. For\r\nto this day they maintain their friendship and trade, and unite for\r\nthe protection of one another, although they are not all Mahometans,\r\nand most of them are infidels, atheists, and total barbarians.\r\n\r\n402. If we consider their more immediate origin, the Caragueños have\r\nthe first place. They are so called from Caraga or Caràghas, which was\r\nformerly the name of all that coast which extended north and south\r\nfrom the point of Surigao to that of San Agustin, and then, turning\r\ntoward the west, extended from Surigao and ran through Iligàn and\r\nas far as Dapitan, until in later times a division of districts was\r\nmade. The Caragas are the oldest people in that island, and without\r\nthe protection of any foreigners have maintained their location and\r\ntheir valorous courage--which was well known in former times, by\r\nthe Visayans and even by all the islands of this archipelago. They\r\nhave rendered greater their valor by the character of Christians (a\r\nfact which they owe to the burning zeal of the discalced Augustinian\r\nfathers, their first conquistadors), since their aid has been the\r\nmost efficient and most formidable in the invasions of the Moros,\r\nin favor of the Church and its evangelical ministers. These people,\r\nif they are not Butuans, differ but little from them, and now they\r\nare united; by which we believe the origin of both to have been common.\r\n\r\n403. The Butuans, worthy of eternal memory and thanks, as they were\r\nthe first among whom the Catholic arms found shelter, come down from\r\nthe village and river of Butuàn, the coast which looks to the north\r\nfrom Mindanào. It was the first soil where the famous Magallanes\r\n[343] planted the domination of Jesus Christ and that of our Catholic\r\nking. All these, perchance, have the same origin as the Visayans and\r\nPintados, because of their great nearness to them. But they are the\r\norigin of the best blood and nobility of the Basilans and Joloans,\r\nfor the king of Xolò even confessed that he was a Butuan. But he gives\r\nthe lie to that by his barbarous procedure, for he has been the scourge\r\nmost disturbing to these islands; while the Butuans have ever remained\r\nfaithful, and have been vassals to God and to our Catholic monarch,\r\nfollowing the example of the Caragas throughout.\r\n\r\n404. The Cagayans take their name from Cagayàn el Chico [i.e.,\r\nthe little], which is [found by] following the coast from Butuan to\r\nthe west and southwest. It is a bay with this name, which is not of\r\nancient usage, but was given from the other Cagayàn, today a province\r\nin the upper part of the island of Luzòn, between Cape Bojeadòr and\r\nthat of Engaño. These islanders are reduced and civilized, and differ\r\nbut little from the previous ones [i.e., the Caragas] from which it\r\nis argued that they are not very different from them in their origin.\r\n\r\n405. The Dapitans were a people who inhabited a closely hemmed-in\r\nstrait between the island of Bohòl and that of Pànglao, and possessed\r\nthe two shores of that strait. They conquered the Boholàns in a war,\r\nand assumed their name and territory. These new and triumphant\r\nBoholans left that island of Bohòl (the country having already\r\nbeen abandoned by the old Boholàns), and went to live in Dapitàn,\r\nlocated on the Mindanào coast, almost opposite Bohòl and Pánglao,\r\nwhence they took the name Dapitàn. That name has been extended and\r\npreserved even to the present, because of their fortunate progress,\r\nand the friendly reception that our first conquistadors experienced\r\nfrom their noble loyalty and honorable valor. No other more remote\r\norigin is known of them, but it is conjectured to be like the others.\r\n\r\n406. The Mindanàos and Malanàos are Moros, but they seem formerly\r\nto have been heathen (from which today they are considered as\r\nnewcomers), and took their names from the celebrated lakes in their\r\nterritories. Father Combès says that the Malanàos resemble the Visayans\r\nin their government, and the same is inferred of the Mindanàos; and,\r\nof both, that one must seek there their true origin. The Mindanàos\r\nhave always remained Mahometans, and have not allowed the light of\r\nthe gospel to enter. The Malanàos, with the district of Bayùg, were\r\nreduced to the yoke of Christ at another time, and were for some years\r\nconstant to their baptisms by the discalced Augustinian fathers; but\r\nlater they grew weary of it. At the present time some of those Moros\r\nhave come to the governor of Manila with the title of ambassadors, from\r\nBayùg and Malanào, in order to petition for the discalced Augustinian\r\nfathers as ministers of the gospel. This is not the first time when\r\nthey have requested them, as well as the Franciscan religious, as I\r\nhave seen in an original document. Since the fathers of the Society\r\nare those to whom those places are adjudged for the preaching of the\r\nholy gospel, and since the disposition of that race is so faithless in\r\ntheir dealings, some suspicions have been aroused by those embassies,\r\nand we are endeavoring to probe their designs in coming.\r\n\r\n407. The Tagabaloòyes take their name from some mountains which they\r\ncall Baloòy, which are located in the interior of the jurisdiction\r\nof Caràga. They are not very far remote from and trade with the\r\nvillages [of Caraga], and some indeed live in them who have become\r\nChristians. Others are being converted through the zeal and care of\r\nthe discalced Augustinian fathers, who regard them as inhabitants of\r\nBaslig, which is their headquarters and priorate. Those people, as has\r\nbeen stated above, are the descendants of lately-arrived Japanese. This\r\nis the opinion of all the religious who have lived there and had\r\nintercourse with them, and the same is a tradition among themselves,\r\nand they desire to be so considered. And it would seem that one is\r\nconvinced of it on seeing them; for they are light-complexioned,\r\nwell built, lusty, very reliable in their dealings, respectful, and\r\nvery valiant, but not restless. So I am informed by one who has had\r\nmuch to do with them; and all the above are qualities which we find\r\nin the Japanese.\r\n\r\n408. The Lutàya nation, or the Lutaos, do not give much sign of their\r\nfirst origin, just as they do not evince any particular inclination\r\nfor one kingdom or another. For since their natural disposition\r\nis one of self-interest and fickle, and delights in war, they make\r\nalliance now with the Joloans, now with the Basilans, and now with the\r\nMindanaos--as quickly with one as another, and as quickly against their\r\nallies and with others. They show that they are Moros by the turban,\r\nthe marlota, [344] their arms, and their ceremonies; but they cannot\r\nbe very ancient, since the Mahometans have not been very long in India\r\nand in these parts. The Lutaos could have come to these islands from\r\nthe regions whence it is inferred that the others have come.\r\n\r\n409. Of the mountain people without civilization or government,\r\nand with the life and custom of barbarians, it is inferred that they\r\nwere some of these primitive possessors, who fled from the civilized\r\nforeigners. These people have various names in various settlements. In\r\nYligàn and Samboàngan, they are called Subànos; in Caràga, Manòbos;\r\nin Xolò, Guinuànos; in Basilàn, Sameacàs. [345] And although some say\r\nthat it is known that they are the descendants of the Malays, because\r\ntheir language is built on the general roots of the Malay language,\r\nthere are religious (living today) who have lived there for many\r\nyears, who assure me that they have not heard, in their method of\r\ntalking with them, any Malay root. Consequently, since the islands\r\nare so strung out even as far as the islands of Bornèy and Macasàr,\r\nand since the crossing is so easy, it is always inferred that their\r\norigin comes from that direction.\r\n\r\n410. In the upper and northern part of the great island of Luzòn are\r\nthe two provinces of Cagayàn and Ylòcos. Those people, as is inferred\r\nby Father Colin, are descended from Chinese or Japanese, because the\r\ngraves of men of larger stature than the Indians have been found there,\r\nas well as some Chinese and Japanese jewels which have been preserved\r\namong them. If these should be slight indications--for they can proceed\r\nfrom various other circumstances, on account of the great nearness of\r\nChina and Japan--they may aid in the foundation of that inference. But\r\nwe cannot get any farther than conjectures, as in everything else,\r\nafter so much toil. It serves only as a light, so that others may infer\r\na truer origin. And the same is true of Pangasinàn, which lies next.\r\n\r\n411. On this account, and without all the above serving as an\r\nobstacle, one can also conjecture the origin of other nations who\r\nare scattered through the innumerable islets of these archipelagoes;\r\nfor they may proceed from all India extra Gangen and from its most\r\nrenowned kingdoms, such as Siàn, Cambòja, China, Cochinchina, Tunquin,\r\nJapon, the Lequios, etc.--especially when not few affirm that the\r\nChinese dominated all this archipelago, and that they were the first\r\nsettlers of the Javas, as is mentioned by Barros. In fine, these are\r\nthe conjectures that I have found. Other conjectures may be made from\r\ntheir customs and ceremonies, in the comparison of which the curious\r\nwill find not a few strong arguments, if they read thoughtfully. But,\r\nat the last, God is the only one who knows the truth, to which our\r\nlimited judgments cannot penetrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n    Of the characteristics [genio] and genius [ingenio] of the\r\n    Filipino Indians\r\n\r\n\r\n[Paragraphs 412, 413, and a portion of 414 will be found in our\r\nVol. XXVIII, pp. 220-223. The balance of the chapter follows.]\r\n\r\n... They are the greatest enemies that the father ministers have. They\r\nare impious in the known necessities of their parents and relatives,\r\nand very charitable to a guest who comes to them and stays leisurely\r\nin their houses, without knowing him and without sending him\r\naway; and they do not even take warning by the experience of great\r\ninconveniences. Many other contradictions and contrarieties are found\r\ndaily in these Indians by those who have communication with them and\r\nknow them, so that in them vices are united to their opposed virtues,\r\nas if related. Only in the matter of lying there is no contradiction,\r\nfor one cannot tell when they are not lying. Neither does one know\r\nwhen they are thankful for any benefits received; for one could\r\nwrite by thousands the cases of their ingratitude which have been\r\nexperienced--either not taking any account of the good that is shown\r\nthem, regarding it as a justice due them; or paying with treachery\r\npure and simple their greatest benefactors. All these are truths,\r\nand although (in the opinion of Terence) they gain hate for the\r\none who states them, it is not right for the Indians who may read\r\nthis to hate me; for I know it all by my own experience and that of\r\nother fathers of long standing--which indeed the Indians who know\r\nthem recognize. In Nueva España and in Perû the same thing occurs,\r\nto about the same extent.\r\n\r\n415. From this result other things, in the same father ministers, that\r\nseem also to be contradictions. For the minister of the Indians who\r\nloves them most would like not to have anything to do with them, but\r\nto be very distant from them; and if he succeeds in getting far away\r\nfrom them, then his love for them will not suffer it and he does not\r\nrest until he is with his Indians again. It is a providence of God, so\r\nthat instruction may never be lacking to these wretched beings. This,\r\nI believe, appears like the discreet love with which Christ loved\r\nJudas, for an example to men; loving persons compassionately, and\r\ndistinguishing their evil qualities, as things detestable. If all the\r\nabove-mentioned contradictions of the Indians are malicious, or arise\r\nfrom their lack of understanding, let him who will examine it, for\r\neven in this have I found new contradictions. For some actions which\r\nappear simple are very doubly acts of malice; and quite the contrary\r\nalso occurs at other times. In short, whether malicious or simple,\r\ntheir mental standpoint [genio] is incomprehensible, and consequently\r\nthe merit that belongs to the ministers of instruction very great.\r\n\r\n416. In regard to the mind [ingenio] and understanding of these\r\nnatives, no general rules can be laid down; for there are rude and\r\nclever ones in all parts, although it be even among Spaniards and\r\nservants in courts. But speaking generally, all authors agree, and\r\nexperience tells us the same, that the Filipinos are more clever than\r\nthe Indians of other parts. They can learn any art at all with ease,\r\nand imitate with exactness any beautiful production that is placed\r\nbefore them. Consequently, they become so fine writers that the\r\naccounting-rooms are filled with them, as are also the secretariats,\r\nthe courts, and the offices of private persons. But very rarely\r\ncan one find the copy of an Indian which does not need revision,\r\nfor they cannot cease lying even in writing; or else because of the\r\nlittle care with which they do it. This is very mortifying to those who\r\ndictate and correct. Some of them have been so capable that they have\r\nbecome officials in the accounting-rooms, and have served ad interim\r\nin the highest offices. Others serve as managers for alcaldes-mayor,\r\nand they have great knowledge of government business; whether with\r\na right conscience, God knows. There are others who have great\r\ncleverness for the management of a suit between litigants; and are\r\nso keen in entangling the parties that they cannot be disentangled\r\nwith their laws, and recourse can be had to God alone. There are\r\nat present some of them who are printers, and they have sufficient\r\nintelligence. In their own political and civil government I have\r\nseen many Indians who are very capable, and who can discourse so\r\npowerfully, with their natural logic, that they convince. But as\r\nit is natural for them to be concerned only about the present time,\r\nthey need some one to direct them so that they may not make any error\r\nin what they discuss. In short, their understandings are fastened\r\nwith pins and attached always to material things, for they do not\r\nunderstand things with any depth. I believe that this is the reason\r\nwhy there is so little fruit produced from the constant repetition\r\nof sermons; for they are perplexed with abundant instruction, or\r\nelse do not understand it. And although the sermon be very clear, and\r\npreached in their own native language, not one of them can yet repeat\r\nthe substance of what he hears, although he understands it when it is\r\npreached. They are, however, very clever at handiwork, because of their\r\ngreat indifference in everything. On that account they can play well\r\non all musical instruments; and their inclination for music is very\r\ngreat, and they make instruments. There are good singers among them,\r\nand these have positions, with a fitting salary attached, in all the\r\nchurches, from the cathedral to the poorest ministry; and thus they\r\nare being trained, from the time when they sing soprano. They are\r\nfond of verses and representations. They are excellent translators,\r\nand can translate a Spanish comedy with elegance into verses of\r\ntheir own language. And thus, although all, both men and women, are\r\nfond of reading, they are indefatigable when verses are concerned,\r\nand they will act them out as they read them. Accordingly it results\r\nthat they are clever for all things, in whatever duty they are set;\r\nand they would be more so if they were less lazy, or if their greed for\r\ntemporal possessions were greater. On this account, they have always\r\nbeen, are, and will be poor, without caring for more than the food of\r\nthe present day. I do not know whether this is a special providence\r\nof God for these poor wretches; for when they have a little wealth,\r\nas the vessel is so limited, immediately it swells out and then they\r\ndo not know what to do; and, to let it be known that they are rich,\r\nthey immediately waste it in expenses that are at best useless, until\r\nthey remain as they were before. Thus their inclination [genio] is\r\nopposite to their judgment [ingenio] in this direction; and although\r\nthey have sufficient intellect, they yield to their natural disposition\r\n[genio], which dominates them, and in this never allow themselves to\r\nbe directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n    Of the letters, languages, and civilization of the Filipinos\r\n\r\n\r\n417. Just as in Italia the Tuscan, Lombard, and Sicilian languages\r\nresemble one another, and in España the Castilian, Portuguese,\r\nand Valencian--for they all recognize one origin (namely, the\r\nRoman), although they are, strictly speaking, quite distinct among\r\nthemselves--so it happens in the languages of these Philipinas\r\nIslands. The principal cultured languages found here at the conquest\r\nwere six, namely, the Tagálog, the Visayan, the Pampanga, the Cagayan,\r\nthe Ilocan, and the Pangasinan. It is a fact that all the languages\r\nhere resemble one another, and he who knows one of them can easily\r\ntalk the others, for the structure of them all differs but little. We\r\ntrace them all to one origin, which cannot be other than the Malayan\r\nlanguage, according to the comparison which has been made of words,\r\nand to the formation and construction of them all. Consequently,\r\nalthough these Indians have regarded their origin as distinct from\r\nthat of various other nations, in the manner already mentioned, it\r\nis evident that the more immediate generations must have been Malays,\r\nsince their letters and languages alone are found in these islands.\r\n\r\n418. The vowels in the characters proper to their language are three\r\nin number, although they have the same value as our five in use;\r\nfor the E and the I form one single letter, as do also the O and\r\nthe U. The consonants are thirteen in number, but they are never\r\nused alone, for the vowel is always used with them. Thus by the use\r\nof the C and the M alone they write cama [i.e., \"bed\"]. In order to\r\npronounce words with other vowels, they make use of certain commas,\r\nplaced either below or above. Consequently, as all the pronunciation of\r\ntheir writing for the most part makes it necessary for them to supply\r\nit at the expense of commas, the difficulty that was experienced\r\nwas considerable, even in the natives themselves. On that account\r\nthey have applied themselves so easily and willingly to our letters,\r\nin order to write in their own language.\r\n\r\n419. Their own method of writing was peculiar, by writing the lines\r\nfrom top to bottom, beginning at the left hand and proceeding to\r\nthe right. This bespeaks a very great antiquity; for the ancient\r\ncustom of the Hebrews is to write lines, from the right to the left,\r\nas the Chinese do at the present time. But the latter write them\r\nfrom top to bottom, as was done in these islands. Diodorus Siculus,\r\nwho wrote in the time of the emperor Cæsar Augustus, says that in\r\nan island of the torrid zone the people wrote from top to bottom,\r\nand employed only a few letters.\r\n\r\n420. Before the people knew anything of paper in these islands\r\nthey wrote on the smooth bark of bamboo, or on leaves of the many\r\npalms which are found in these islands (and even yet this is done, in\r\ndistricts where there is no paper, or even that the schoolboys may not\r\nwaste paper), the point of a knife or an iron, or some other material,\r\nserving as a pen (and now with birds' quills and ink). If it were a\r\nmissive letter, they wrote it on palm-leaves, and folded it as we fold\r\nour letters. Some of them are much given to writing on the ground in\r\na squatting posture, which is the usual way both men and women sit.\r\n\r\n421. The cultured languages, as already stated, are six in number--for\r\none cannot reckon the languages of the Negritos and mountain people\r\nas such, since each settlement has its own distinct language,\r\nwhich results from the lack of human intercourse. Among the cultured\r\nlanguages, the chief and mother languages are considered the Tagálog,\r\nthe Pampanga, and the Visayan; and even among these the Tagálog is\r\nconsidered the most polished and powerful. That is not [for instance]\r\nbecause it lacks the tu [i.e., \"thou\"]--which is well employed with\r\ntheir primitive pronoun ycao or ca, even with persons to whom the\r\ngreatest respect is due--but on account of the po and Po co, which\r\nexplains it, and signifies \"Sir\" [señor mio]. The first is used for\r\nmen, and the second for women. Interwoven with the words, it shows\r\nreverence and courtesy; as, for example, in order to answer \"Yes\"\r\nto a woman one says Oo, Po co, an expression which without the Po co\r\nwould be too familiar. In many other phrases in the Tagálog language\r\nis shown its seriousness and polish; those who write grammars of the\r\nlanguage will be able to set them forth.\r\n\r\n422. The natives of these islands employ innumerable other elegancies\r\nand courtesies, now in actions, now in words, now in names and titles,\r\nwhich they apply to themselves; these are various according to the\r\ndifference of the provinces, and are too numerous to mention, for they\r\nare ceremonial, and they value their ceremonies highly. No one will\r\npass in front of another, without asking permission, and in order to\r\npass, he doubles the whole body with the most profound bow, at the same\r\ntime lifting one foot in the air, and doubling the knee and lifting\r\nboth hands to the face. If one has to talk to any person of higher\r\nrank, he shows all reverence and squats down [pone en cuclillas],\r\nwith raised face, and waits thus, until he is asked his reason for\r\ncoming; for to speak without being questioned would be a point of\r\nbad breeding. They employ many courteous acts and expressions in\r\nsaluting one another when they meet; but these do not seem to me to\r\nbe so many as in Nueva España, where people do not cease to use them\r\nuntil they lose sight of one another in the street. The Filipinos\r\ndo this here with greater dignity and respect. When they write, they\r\nheighten their style with so many rhetorical phrases, metaphors, and\r\npictures, that many who think themselves poets would be glad to do\r\nas much; and yet this is only in prose. For, when it comes to poesy,\r\nhe who would understand it must be very learned in their language,\r\neven among his own compatriots.\r\n\r\n423. The names which they impose now are usually high-sounding. I\r\nknow a Pius V, and a Philipe V; and, following this custom, they take\r\nas surnames the most honorable names of España. This is since they\r\nhave known Castilians. But, even before, they could rival in this the\r\nkings of España; for just as the latter have been called \"the Wise,\"\r\n\"the Prudent,\" \"the Chaste,\" etc., for the special virtues which\r\nhave made them worthy of this glory, so here in the Philipinas, they\r\ncalled one \"the Strong,\" another \"the Splendid,\" and another \"the\r\nTerrible,\" according to his deeds, or to those of his ancestors, or\r\nin accordance with various incidents that happened at birth. Now they\r\nare introducing the custom of taking the paternal name added to the\r\nbaptismal name. However, when the first-born child comes to any one,\r\nthe latter's Christian name is forgotten; for that instant they call\r\nthe father by the name of his first-born for the rest of his life. If\r\nthe name of the first-born is Rosa, the father is called Ama ni Rosa,\r\nor Pan-Rosa, which means \"the father of Rosa.\" One must not then ask\r\nfor such a man in any village by his Christian name (which is the one\r\nentered on the parish register), for there are many so named, so that\r\nhe would not be known by that name. An author is not wanting to call\r\nthis an instance of courtesy; but many times it serves as a dishonor,\r\nif they know him and call him, for example, \"father of Judas.\" They\r\nemploy many other names and endearing expressions in naming their\r\nchildren, relatives, and families, although I believe that the\r\naffection that they feel for one another has very little reality.\r\n\r\n424. The \"Don\" of the Castilians is being rapidly introduced among the\r\nIndian chiefs, both men and women, of these islands. In olden times\r\nthey did not lack a term proper to their own language by which they\r\nexpressed it, as Lacan or Gat for the men, and Dayang for the women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n    Of the physical features and clothing of these Indians\r\n\r\n\r\n425. According to the differences in climate we find certain\r\ndifferences in the lines of the body and faces of the Indians, as has\r\nbeen stated above. But this difference amounts to but little. All\r\nof them are sufficiently corpulent, well-built, and well-featured,\r\nexcept that they are all flat-nosed; for the cartilage of the bridge\r\nof the nose does not come to a point as among Europeans. Consequently,\r\nthere are no sharp noses among the full-blooded Indians. Some have\r\ntried to explain the color by saying that it is the color of cooked\r\nquinces, or brown, or an olive color. But it appears much stranger\r\nto me, and I have been unable to find a legitimate color to which\r\nto compare it; for it is a brown color, but flushed with red. [346]\r\nIt is generally clearer in the women, and still lighter in all of the\r\nVisayans. The hair is black and lank, as is that of the Scythians,\r\nGetas [i.e., Getæ], and Turks, and is carefully tended with washings,\r\nand very fragrant oils, as was that of the Lycians. They assert that\r\nthey do this in order to free it from grease (which is considerable),\r\nbut a great part of it consists in vanity. Among the Tagálogs it is\r\nallowed to grow to the shoulders, among the Ilocans somewhat longer,\r\nand among the Visayans slightly longer or shorter, and done up; but the\r\nCagayans leave it loose and hanging upon the shoulders. This custom\r\nmust have appeared well to all of them, since everywhere they envy\r\nthe one who has the longest and heaviest hair; and the same thing is\r\nseen among the women. It is indeed considered as an affront to cut\r\nthe hair for any crime. The Zambals alone shave the head from the\r\nmiddle forward; and from the middle back, as far as the occiput, they\r\nwear a large shock of loose hair. Ribbons are never used to tie it,\r\nbut with the hair itself men, women, and children make a knot near\r\nthe crown of the head or the occiput, as do the Turks.\r\n\r\n426. The eyes of all are very beautiful and large, either gray or\r\nblack. The face is broad. The teeth are even and fine; formerly they\r\ncovered them with ink or a varnish of a black color. Now that is no\r\nlonger used except among the Tagabaloòyes of Caragà, of whom I have\r\nwritten; their beauty, lightness of complexion, and the features of\r\ntheir faces might deceive one, and they would be taken for Spaniards if\r\nthey kept their mouths shut, and one did not see the black teeth. They\r\nalso, especially the chief women, adorned the teeth with gold,\r\nwith exquisite beauty. I do not know whether they waste the gold so\r\nnow. All of the men are beardless in the face, but their bodies are\r\nsufficiently shaggy, as are those of all Asiatics. It is attributed\r\nto the temperature of the torrid zone in which we are. Who cares to\r\nstudy this more in detail would better read Fray Gregorio Garcia, the\r\nDominican. [347] In olden times the Indians removed and pulled out,\r\nas if it were a defect, any little hair that appeared on the face,\r\nwith pincers of bamboo made for that very purpose. I have not read\r\nthat they did this because they considered it a reproach to have a\r\nbeard, as did those of Perù--who did the same, as I have read in the\r\nabove-cited author.\r\n\r\n427. The women (and in many parts the men, especially the\r\nmountaineers), have certain large holes in their ears, in which they\r\nplace pendants and earrings of gold. They make the greater display\r\nof it according to the greater size and openness of the holes. Some\r\nwomen have two holes in each ear, for two kinds of earrings. This is\r\nusual among the Zimarrònes and blacks, for the civilized people have\r\nnow adopted the custom of the Castilians in this regard.\r\n\r\n428. In olden times the men wore their heads covered or wrapped about\r\nwith a narrow strip of cotton or linen. Those who esteemed themselves\r\nas valiant men wore the two ends hanging to the shoulders. This they\r\ncalled the potong; and some wore this of colored cloth, to declare\r\ntheir chieftainship. No one could wear a red one unless he had killed\r\nat least one person, and he could not have it striped until he had\r\nkilled seven. Now they wear neat white and black hats, which are\r\nwoven from various materials which they gather in the field.\r\n\r\n429. Of the mountain people it is already known that their own skin\r\nis their clothing, and that they only use the bahag, which is a linen\r\nor cloth which keeps in the privies. But the clothing of the men\r\nwho live in villages is a half-shirt of linen, silk, or some other\r\nmaterial--which, at the most, reaches to the navel; it is open to the\r\nair, and has wide sleeves without wristbands, and this is called the\r\nbaro--and certain garments that they call saluàles, which correspond\r\nto our small-clothes or under-drawers. These are also loose and\r\nwide, and made of any kind of linen or other material; they do not\r\nopen at the front, but at the side, and they are tied there. They\r\nnever wear anything on feet or legs. The above is the whole amount\r\nof their clothing, and, at the most, a cord or belt at the waist,\r\nlike a girdle, where they hang the knife. The chiefs and others wear,\r\nfor church functions and other meetings of theirs, in addition to\r\nthe said clothing, a long black garment reaching to the feet, with\r\nsleeves fitted at the wrists. This they call barong-mahaba, which\r\nsignifies \"long baro.\" It is an eminently modest and decent garment,\r\nand is worn loose and not girdled. For outside wear, these garments\r\nare of ordinary materials. For gala attire, they are of silk, and\r\nmuch worked with embroidery, except the long baro, which is always\r\nthe same. Today the people of highest rank in the villages dress\r\nin the Spanish fashion, with coats, trousers, stockings, and shoes,\r\nalthough it is the most usual practice to wear stockings of natural\r\nskin, in the midst of all these adornments. In former times, their\r\ngreatest care was exercised in supplying the lack of clothing with\r\nabundance of gold, with which they adorned all the body. That custom\r\nis still preserved, although not in the abundance of which we read\r\nearlier. In what they wore the full complement of their gala attire\r\nwas a colored sash drawn up under the arm, which is no longer worn at\r\nthe present time. All the clothing of the Filipino Indian is reduced\r\nto the above, and I believe that it is so throughout this archipelago,\r\nwithout any difference of special note.\r\n\r\n430. The dress of the women is the baro already mentioned, but not so\r\nlong, and only covering the breasts and hanging loose; and a garment as\r\nwide above as below, in which they envelope the body from the waist\r\ndown, fastening one of the ends in the girdle in order to secure\r\nit. This garment is called a tàpis. The mestizo women wear skirts\r\nwith plaits and seams, with the opening at one side. The tàpis is the\r\nunchangeable costume of the Indian women of this archipelago, and this,\r\nat the most, is generally of silk, but of a modest hue, and of only\r\none color. Upon their festival occasions the women--some for gala\r\nattire, or others, because they are more modest--wear white Spanish\r\npetticoats. Some wear an underskirt, especially within doors. But when\r\nthey go abroad, the tàpis is [preferred] above all. Some of them wear\r\ngarments resembling black mantillas, which they call cobìjas, with\r\nwhich they cover the whole body from the head down, in the manner of\r\nthe mantillas of España. With this and the bits of gold that they\r\nwear on the body--in the ears, at the throat, on the wrists and\r\nfingers (and she who does not possess these ornaments must be very\r\npoor indeed)--they appear as Indian women in their wealth of gold,\r\nand are Indian women in their being and clothing. Now when the Indian\r\nwomen go abroad, they wear slippers embroidered with silk and gold;\r\nfew and far between are those who wear shoes. Formerly, they wore a\r\nribbon, of wrought gold which covered their foreheads and temples. Now,\r\nat the most, they usually wear a chased silver or gold nail, thrust\r\nthrough the knot of their hair. Women of a somewhat more advanced age\r\nand respect wear the long baro, which is made in the same manner as\r\nthat of the men above described. It is certain that an Indian woman\r\nappears well in this manner, for there is no more modest dress for\r\nwomen that one can imagine.\r\n\r\n431. The chief bodily adornments of the Visayans were the tattooing\r\nand designs which gave them the name of Pintados. They did this in the\r\nsame manner as the Moro men and women, and it was the olden custom of\r\nthe Huns, Gelones, and Agathyrsos; but the kind of the designs was\r\naccording to the deeds and merit of each person. But that barbarous\r\nmethod of adornment was lost long ago, and has not been seen among them\r\nfor many years. Perhaps they have erased those pictures with the water\r\nof holy baptism, since they embraced the true Catholic ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n    Of the false religion which these Indians held in their\r\n    heathendom; and of their superstitions and omens.\r\n\r\n\r\n432. The great slothfulness and natural carelessness of these Indians\r\nis recognized by its results; for as yet not the slightest scrap of\r\nwriting concerning their religion and ceremonies, or their ancient\r\npolitical government, has been found. Only by tradition and old songs\r\nwhich have been preserved from father to son, and from other things\r\nwhich they have still in use, has it been possible to trace somewhat of\r\ntheir antiquity by means of some careful ministers. The first who took\r\nhis pen for this purpose, at the instance of the superior government,\r\nwas our venerable Fray Juan de Plassencia, one of the most zealous\r\nworkers in the vineyard of this archipelago, in the year 1589. [348]\r\nSo great credence was given to him in this, that his relation of the\r\ncustoms of the Indians, having been received by the royal Audiencia,\r\nwas imparted to the alcaldes-mayor of the provinces for their\r\ngovernment. Later, in the year 1598, with but little difference in\r\ntime, Doctor Don Antonio de Morga, auditor and lieutenant-governor of\r\nPhilipinas, wrote his description. In it the same matter is treated,\r\ntaken from the other. Our Fray Antonio de la Llave, [349] afterward\r\n(in the year 1622) used this in his description. In the year 1660,\r\nFather Colin wrote his description, adding anew the best form. Since\r\nthis is a matter in which we cannot exceed the ancients, yet with\r\nthem all it will be necessary for me to write something, in order\r\nthat I may not leave this treatise of my description faulty.\r\n\r\n433. These Indians had various sorts of adorations: now to animals and\r\nbirds, as did the Egyptians; now to the sun and the moon, as did the\r\nAssyrians. The Tagálogs adored now Tigmamanoquìn, which was a blue bird\r\nof the size of a turtledove; now the crow, which they called Meylupa,\r\nwhich signifies \"Lord of the soil,\" as if he were the god Pan, or the\r\ngoddess Ceres of the ancients; now the crocodile, which they called\r\nnono, which signifies \"grandfather,\" to which they offered various\r\nsacrifices in order that it might not harm them. Sometimes they adored\r\nany old tree, especially the one they call balete, and even those now\r\nliving show respect to it; now they adored and offered gifts to the\r\nstones, crags, reefs, and promontories of seas and rivers. All was the\r\nresult of their natural fear, so that all these things should cause\r\nthem no harm. Nevertheless, they had a knowledge of one sole God;\r\nand accordingly they adored Him as the principal God, and greater\r\nthan all. The Visayans called Him Lauon, which signifies \"ancient;\"\r\nand the Tagálogs Bathalà Mey capal, signifying \"God, the Maker,\r\nor Creator of all things.\"\r\n\r\n434. Besides these they had other idols, which the Visayans called\r\nDiuata, and the Tagálogs, Anito, each of which had its special\r\nobject and purpose. For there was one anito for the mountains and\r\nopen country; another for the sowed fields; others for the sea and\r\nrivers; another for the house of their dwelling. These anitos they\r\ninvoked in their work, according to the functions of each one. Among\r\nthese they also made anitos of their ancestors, and to these was due\r\nthe first adoration of all. The memory of this anito is not even yet\r\nerased. They kept some small badly-made figures of all these, of gold,\r\nstone, ivory, or wood; and they called them Lic-hà or Laràuan, which\r\nmeans a \"figure\" or \"image\" among them.\r\n\r\n435. They also venerated as anitos those who came to disastrous ends,\r\nbecause either the lightning, or the shark, or the sword, killed them;\r\nfor they thought that such immediately went to glory, by way of the\r\nrainbow, which they call balangao. With such barbarous beliefs lived\r\nand died the old people, puffed up and vain, considering themselves as\r\nanitos. As such they caused themselves to be respected and worshiped;\r\nand buried after death in places set apart and of distinction among\r\nthem all, as they were reverenced there. There are many cases of\r\nthis known, and it required all the valor and zeal of the father\r\nministers to destroy tombs, fell trees, and burn idols. But it is yet\r\nimpossible to tear up the blind error of the pasingtabì sa nonò, which\r\nconsists in begging favor from their aged dead whenever they enter\r\nany thicket or mountain or sowed fields, in order to build houses\r\nand for other things. For if they do not do this, they believe that\r\ntheir nonos will punish them with some evil result. This is found\r\namong an ignorant people without malice, who do not know why they\r\ndo this, but only that they do it because they saw that their aged\r\npeople do it here. The ministers labored hard to remove this error,\r\nespecially in the remote villages; for in those that are now civilized\r\nthe people at present laugh at it.\r\n\r\n436. For all these adorations and sacrifices it is not evident that\r\nthey had any common and public temple. For although these places had\r\nthe name of simba or simbahan, which signifies \"place of adoration\r\nand sacrifice,\" and the people attended them and resorted thither,\r\nthey were not like our temples common to all, but, as it were,\r\ncertain private oratories belonging to the houses of their chiefs,\r\nwhere those of their families, or their dependents, or those related\r\nby marriage, met to make a feast for any special object. For this\r\npurpose they made a bower in the house itself, which they call sibi,\r\ndividing it into three naves and lengthening the fourth. They adorned\r\nit with leaves and flowers on all sides, and many lighted lamps. In\r\nthe middle was placed another large lamp, with many ornaments. Such\r\nwas their simbahan or oratory. This feast was called pandot; it was\r\ntheir most solemn one, and lasted four days. During that time they\r\nplayed many musical instruments, and performed their adorations,\r\nwhich is called nag àanito [350] in Tagálog. When the feast was ended\r\nand all the adornment removed, the place had no longer the name of\r\nchurch or temple, and remained a house like all the others.\r\n\r\n437. Their sacrifices always redounded to the advantage of their\r\nbodies; for they were reduced to all eating, drinking, and making\r\nmerry. In proportion to the motives, so were the ceremonies of their\r\nsacrifices. If it were only for the entertainment of their chief, they\r\nmade a bower in front of his house, which they filled with hangings,\r\naccording to their Moorish custom; and there they all ate, drank,\r\ndanced, and sang. For this it was the usual practice to fetch a hog,\r\nwhich the catalôna or priestess ordered the most graceful girl to stab\r\nwith the knife, amid certain dances. That done, and the hog having\r\nbeen cooked according to their custom it was divided among all the\r\ncompany, as if it were a relic; and they ate it with great reverence\r\nand respect, with the other food of their feast. They drank more\r\nthan they ate, as they always do. With this was ended the greatness\r\nof their sacrifice, without God to whom to offer it, or altar therefor.\r\n\r\n438. If the sacrifice was for the health of some sick person, the\r\npriest of the sacrifice ordered a new house to be built at the expense\r\nof the sick one. That done (which took but a very short time, as the\r\nmaterials are close at hand, and many assemble for that purpose),\r\nthey removed the sick person to it, and arranged what was to be\r\nsacrificed. That was sometimes a slave, but most generally some\r\nhog or marine animal; its flesh they set before the sick person,\r\nwith other food according to their custom. The catalôna performed her\r\nusual dances, wounded the animal, and with its blood anointed the sick\r\nperson, as well as some of the others among the bystanders. Then it\r\nwas divided and cleaned, in order that it might be eaten. The catalôna\r\nlooked at the entrails, and making wry faces and shaking her feet and\r\nhands, acted as if she were out of her senses--foaming at the mouth,\r\neither because she was incarnate as the devil, or because she so\r\nfeigned so that credit might be given her. In this way she prophesied\r\nwhat would happen to the sick man, either adverse or propitious. If it\r\nwere propitious, there was great feasting; and if adverse, means were\r\nnot lacking to her to evade it--as they were also not lacking in case\r\nthat her prophecy was not fulfilled. If the sick man died, she consoled\r\nthem all by saying that their gods had elected him as one of their\r\nanitos, because of his prowess and merits; and she began to commend\r\nherself to this saint, and made them all commend themselves to him, and\r\neverything ended in drunkenness and rejoicing. Then the catalôna took\r\nall the gifts, which all had offered her according to their custom,\r\nand returned home, wealthier, but not with more reputation; for those\r\nwho exercised that office among the Indians were held in no estimation,\r\nfor they were considered lazy persons who lived by the toil of others.\r\n\r\n439. When the sick person died, he was followed by the lamentation\r\nof his relatives and friends and even by other and hired mourners,\r\nwho had that as their trade. In their lamentation they inserted a\r\nmelancholy song, with innumerable extravagant things in praise of the\r\ndead. They bathed, smoked, and shrouded the corpse, and some embalmed\r\nit in the manner of the Hebrews, with certain aromatic liquors;\r\nand thus did they bury it, with all due respect.\r\n\r\n440. The grave of the poor was a hole which was dug under the house\r\nitself, and was called sìlong. The rich and influential were kept\r\nunburied for three days, amid the weeping and singing. A box or coffin\r\nwas made out of one piece, which was the dug-out trunk of a tree;\r\nand the cover was tightly fitted on, so that no air could enter. There\r\nthey buried the deceased, adorned with rich jewels and sheets of gold,\r\nespecially upon his mouth. As the coffins were usually of incorruptible\r\nwood, which was used for this purpose, in this way some bodies have\r\nbeen found uncorrupted after many years.\r\n\r\n441. The coffin with the body was placed in one of three places,\r\naccording to the direction of the deceased: either in the highest\r\nstory of the house itself, in a place like a cock-house, where they\r\nusually keep their treasures and other goods; or under the house,\r\nwhich is the sìlong, elevated from the ground; or if they place it\r\nin the ground itself, they dig a hole, and enclose it with a small\r\nrailing and there they deposit the box with the body without covering\r\nover the hole. They buried others in the fields, and lit fires in the\r\nhouse, and then set sentinels so that the deceased should not come\r\nto take away the living with him. Others had themselves buried in a\r\nlofty place on the seashore, in order that they might be venerated\r\nand worshiped; and sentinels were posted so that no boats should pass\r\nthere for a certain time.\r\n\r\n442. Another box, filled with the best clothes of the deceased and\r\nvarious viands on their dishes, were set near the grave; if the\r\ndeceased were a man, various weapons that he used were left there;\r\nif a woman, her loom, or other work-utensils that she had used. If\r\nthe deceased had while living been employed in sea-raids, as a\r\npirate, his coffin was made in the shape of a boat which they call\r\nbarangay. As rowers they placed in it two goats, two hogs, two deer,\r\nor more, as they wished, male and female paired, with a slave of the\r\ndeceased as pilot in order to take care of them all. Some food was\r\nput in for their sustenance, and when that food was consumed, they\r\ndried up with hunger and thirst, and all perished. If the deceased\r\nhad been a warrior, a living slave, bound, was placed under him,\r\nand was left there to die with him. After the burial, although the\r\nlamentation ceased somewhat, the revelry in the house of the deceased\r\ndid not cease. On the contrary, it lasted a longer or shorter time,\r\naccording to the rank of the deceased.\r\n\r\n443. On the third or fourth day of the funeral, all the relatives\r\nassembled at the house of the deceased, for they said that he returned\r\nthat day to visit them. At the landing of the stairway of the house,\r\nthey set water in a basin or tub, so that the deceased might wash\r\nhis feet there, and rid himself of the earth of the grave. They kept\r\na candle lit all that day. They stretched a petate, or reed mat, on\r\nthe floor and sprinkled ashes on it, so that the deceased might leave\r\nthe marks of his feet there. At meal time they left the best place at\r\ntable vacant for the dead guest. They ate and drank, as at the most\r\nsplendid banquet; and then spent the balance of the day in relating\r\nand singing the prowess of the deceased; then each one went home. This\r\nridiculous ceremony is called tibao. The Indians even yet retain\r\nthe oldtime custom of this assembly, but all superstition and error\r\nhave been removed from it, and they unite to pray for the deceased;\r\nbut it is not without inconveniences that ought to be remedied.\r\n\r\n444. The mourning consisted in fasting, and during the days of mourning\r\nthey lived only on vegetables. This fasting or abstinence was called\r\nsipà by the Tagálogs. In dress the Visayans wore white, as do the\r\nChinese in sign of mourning, and this is even yet the custom in some\r\nvillages; but black is the most usual color for mourning in the rest\r\nof the islands. With this kind of mourning they cover all the body,\r\nso that the face may not be seen, especially if they are women and if\r\nthe mourning is thorough. During the mourning the men may not wear\r\na hat; but, instead, a black cloth wound about the head. They wear\r\nmourning for any deceased relative, even though he be related only\r\nvery distantly; but the mourning is greater or less according to the\r\ndegree of relationship, both in manner and in duration of time.\r\n\r\n445. From the above is inferred the belief of these Indians in the\r\ntransmigration of the souls of the deceased. In this they agree not\r\nonly with the Chinese, who believe in this peculiar error, but also\r\nwith other Indians whom Torquemada mentions in his second volume. The\r\nsimilarity that they might relate in rites, both with the Indians of\r\nNueva España and Perû, and with other nations of greater antiquity,\r\nmay be compared by the curious reader, by reading the entire book\r\nof the Origin of the Indians, and by tracing there that of these\r\nIndians. [351]\r\n\r\n446. It is an assured fact that the oldtime heathen of these islands\r\nknew that after this life there was another one of rest, or let us\r\nsay paradise (for Bathàla Maycapàl alone in their belief lived in the\r\nsky); and that only the just and valiant, those who had moral virtues\r\nand lived without harming anyone, went thither to that place as a\r\nreward. In the same way, as all of them believed in the immortality\r\nof the soul in the other life, they believed in a place of punishment,\r\npain, and sorrow which they called casanàan, where the wicked went, and\r\nwhere, they said, the devils dwelt. Consequently, the transmigration of\r\nthe souls of their deceased to other living bodies was a sign of rest\r\nto them. Since no one desired his relatives to be numbered among the\r\ncondemned in casanàan, the error of the Chinese found in them an easier\r\nentrance, for it was built upon the foundation of their own errors.\r\n\r\n447. The superstitions and omens of these Filipinos are so many, and\r\nso different are those which yet prevail in many of them, especially\r\nin the districts more remote from intercourse with the religious,\r\nthat it would take a great space to mention them. They merit tears,\r\nalthough they are all laughable. They are being continually preached\r\nagainst, but we have not succeeded in extinguishing them; and the\r\npeople obey the customs of their barbarous ancestors rather than the\r\nChristian prudence which the ministers teach them. And although I do\r\nnot at this time consider it as an explicit error, ut in plurimum,\r\nyet the error implied in the tenacity with which these people follow\r\nthe errors of their ancestors is dangerous.\r\n\r\n448. Now they ask permission of the nonos for any task, with the\r\npasingtabi sa nono. Now they have innumerable fears if the owl which\r\nthey call covàgo hoots; if they find a snake in a new house, or on\r\na journey that they have undertaken; if they hear anyone sneeze;\r\nif any rat squeals, or if the lizard sings, or if any dog howls; and\r\nother things like these. There must be no talk of fish in the house of\r\nthe hunter, nor of hunting nor dogs in that of the fisherman; while\r\nin neither the one nor the other house must there be any mention of\r\nnew implements for work, unless they have already been used. Sailors\r\nmust name nothing of the land, nor landsmen anything of the sea:\r\nfor all these were omens.\r\n\r\n449. Pregnant women could not cut their hair, for they said that the\r\nchildren that they would bear would have no hair. When a woman is about\r\nto give birth, some men undress until they are stark naked. Then taking\r\nshields and catans, one takes his stand in the silong, and another\r\non the ridge of the house, and they continually fence with the wind\r\nwith their catans as long as the parturition lasts. I have removed\r\nsome from this performance by force of punishment. They say that it\r\nis to keep the patiànac and the osuàng away from the woman. These\r\nare witches among them who come to obstruct the success of the\r\nchildbirth, and to suck out the souls of children; and the people\r\nact thus in order to prevent them. He who does not wish to have this\r\nobserved in public, through fear of punishment, removes his wife to\r\nanother house for the parturition, if he thinks that the witch is in\r\nhis. The procurer of this witch they say is the bird tictic, [352]\r\nand that this bird, by flying and singing, shows the witch or osuàng\r\nthe house where there is a parturition, and even guides him to work\r\nother misfortunes. Consequently, whenever they see or hear the tictic,\r\nthey all grow melancholy, in their fear lest some harm come to them.\r\n\r\n450. They greatly fear and reverence the tigbàlang or bibit. This is\r\na ghost, goblin, or devil; and as it knows the cowardice of these\r\nIndians, it has been wont to appear to them in the mountains--now\r\nin the guise of an old man, telling them that he is their nono; now\r\nas a horse; and now as a monster. Consequently, the Indians in their\r\nterror make various pacts with it, and trade their rosaries for various\r\narticles of superstitious value, such as hairs, grass, stones, and\r\nother things, in order to obtain all their intents and free themselves\r\nfrom all the dangers. Thus do they live in delusion until God wills\r\nthat the evangelical ministers undeceive them, which costs no little\r\n[effort], because of the very great fear with which they are filled.\r\n\r\n451. In order to discover any theft, they generally burn fresh\r\nrock-alum, and after it has vaporized and then crystallized they say\r\nthat the figure which those crystals form is the living picture of\r\nSo-and-so, and that he is the author of the theft. Since they believe\r\nsuch nonsense as easily as it is difficult to make them believe the\r\ndivine mysteries, they all agree to that statement, even though the\r\nface should be that of a dog; and they make a charge in court against\r\nSo-and-so, and impute the theft to him. Sometimes they take a screen or\r\nsieve (which they call bilào), in which they fasten some scissors in\r\nform of a cross, to which a rosary is hung. Then they proceed to call\r\nthe name of each one who is present at this exercise. If the bilào\r\nshakes when the name of Pedro is called, then that poor Pedro is the\r\nrobber, and pays for the theft, without having perhaps eaten or drunk\r\nof it. [353] Sometimes they light a candle to the saint of miracles,\r\nmy St. Anthony of Padua, misapplying his peculiar protection for\r\nall lost things; they believe that if the flame of the candle should\r\nflare up in the direction of any of those present at this act, he is\r\nthus shown to be the robber. For these and like deceitful artifices,\r\nthere are not wanting masters, Indian impostors, both men and women,\r\nwho, in order to gain money, deceive the simple-minded in this manner,\r\nwithout paying any heed to the claims of conscience in these wrongs.\r\n\r\n452. The different kinds of these ministers of the devil in the olden\r\ndays, so far as I have examined them, are twelve, and they are as\r\nfollows, according to their own old names for them: sònat, catalònan,\r\nmangagávay, manyisalàt, mancocòlam, hoclòban, silàgan, magtatangàl,\r\nosuàng, mangagayoma, pangatahòan, and bayòguin.\r\n\r\n453. The sònat was equivalent to a bishop among them; and they all\r\nreverenced him as one who pardoned sins, and ordained others as priests\r\nand priestesses. They expected salvation through him, and he could\r\ncondemn them all. This office was general throughout these islands,\r\nbut it was held only by the chiefest and most honored, as it was of\r\ngreat esteem among them. It is said that this office came from the\r\nBorneans. Some try to make out that he was the master of a kind of\r\nexercise that is not decent, but I have found nothing certain among\r\nthe much that I have examined.\r\n\r\n454. The catalònan (as remarked above) was the priest or priestess\r\nof their sacrifices; and although his office was an honorable one,\r\nit was only while the sacrifice was pending, for after that they paid\r\nbut scant attention to him.\r\n\r\n455. The mangagàvay were the sorcerers who gave and took away health\r\nand life by their sorceries. It was an office general throughout\r\nthis archipelago.\r\n\r\n456. The manyisalàt was the sorcerer appointed for lovers. The\r\nmancocòlam was the sorcerer or witch who belched forth fire from\r\nhimself, which could not be extinguished with any application except\r\nby his rolling himself in the ordure and filth that falls from the\r\nhouses into the silong; and the master of the house where he rolled\r\nhimself died and there was no remedy. The hoclòban was another kind of\r\nsorcerer more efficacious than the others, since without any medicine\r\nhe could kill, overturn houses, and work other destruction. This is\r\nin Catanduanes, but the two preceding ones are general.\r\n\r\n457. The silàgan's duty was to draw out the entrails and eat them,\r\nfrom all persons whom he saw dressed in white. That happened toward\r\nCatanduanes; and it is not fable, since our Fray Juan de Mérida buried\r\na Spanish clerk in Calilàya to whom this misfortune had happened. The\r\nmagtatàngal is said to have been a man who left his body without head\r\nand intestines, and that the head wandered about hither and thither\r\nduring the night in different parts of the world, and in the morning\r\nreunited with his body, leaving him alive as before. This story is\r\ncurrent in Catanduànes, but it is regarded as a fable, although the\r\nnatives assert that they have seen it.\r\n\r\n458. We have already spoken of the osuàng. It is only added that human\r\nflesh is his usual food. They all saw this one flying, but this is\r\ntold in the Visayas and not in Tagalos.\r\n\r\n459. The mangagayòma was the sorcerer who made use of the natural\r\nremedies in his sorceries; but those remedies were often corrupted by\r\npacts with the devil. The pangatahòan is the same as the soothsayer,\r\nwho prognosticated the future; and this notion was general throughout\r\nthis archipelago. The bayòguin was an effeminate man [hombre maricon],\r\ninclined to be a woman and to all the duties of the feminine sex.\r\n\r\n460. This is sufficient as an index of innumerable other errors,\r\nsuperstitions, and omens, in which their ancients were submerged,\r\nand some of their descendants now follow their footsteps. However,\r\nI am of the opinion that it is born rather of their simplicity than of\r\ntheir malice, ut in plurimum. Yet I would not be so bold as to assert\r\nthat there are not some who make their contracts with the devil; and,\r\nwith or without contracts, it is certain that many enchantments are\r\nfound here, whence follow deaths to some and extraordinary accidents\r\nto others. And although that can be attributed to the multitude of\r\nherbs of which they have good knowledge, they always leave suspicion\r\nof some diabolical art.\r\n\r\n461. The oaths which were and are most usual in these Indians are\r\nexecratory. Since they lie so much, I do not know why they are\r\nnot brought to confusion in the promissory notes that are always\r\nfurnished with curses. In the oath of allegiance which the people\r\nof Manila and Tondo took to our Catholic monarchs in the year 1571,\r\nthey confirmed that promise of their obedience in this manner:\r\n\"May the sun split us through the middle; may we be devoured by\r\ncrocodiles; may our women not show us favor or affection\"--if they\r\nshould fail to keep their oath. Sometimes they took the pasambahan,\r\nwhich was, to draw the figure of any wild and monstrous animal, and\r\nask to be torn to pieces by that animal if they broke their contract\r\nor agreement. Sometimes they lit a candle, and declared that, just\r\nas the candle, so might they be melted, if they did not fulfil their\r\npromise. Now this is somewhat better, but not, their perjuries; for\r\nwith great ease and frequency one catches them in false oaths in legal\r\ninstruments. This is well known, and therefore should be well punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n    Of the former government and social customs of these Indians\r\n\r\n\r\n462. I have already said that our brother and venerable father Fray\r\nJuan de Plassencia wrote in the convent of Nagcarlàn and signed\r\n(October 24, 1589) a relation describing all the old customs of\r\nthese Indians, in obedience to a request and charge of the superior\r\ngovernment. That relation appeared to all a very truthful statement,\r\nas, in order to make it, his examination and vigilance were rigorous.\r\n\r\n463. Of this relation I have already used what I thought ought to be\r\nset down in their fitting places. Now I shall say in substance what\r\nhe tells when speaking of the social customs of the Indians and their\r\nold-time government, with some additions which serve for the better\r\nunderstanding of the matter.\r\n\r\n464. These Indians were not so lacking in prudence in the olden\r\ntime that they did not have their economic, military and political\r\ngovernment, those being the branches derived from the stem of\r\nprudence. Even the political government was not so simple among all of\r\nthem that they did not have their architectonic rule--not monarchic,\r\nfor they did not have an absolute king; nor democratic, for those who\r\ngoverned a state or village were not many; but an aristocratic one,\r\nfor there were many magnates (who are here called either maguinòos\r\nor datos), among whom the entire government was divided.\r\n\r\n465. In the olden days, when, as most of them believe, the Malays came\r\nto conquer these islands, they called the boat or ship by the name of\r\nbarangay, which is well known and much used in these times. In this\r\nboat came a whole family, consisting of parents, children, relatives,\r\nand slaves, under the government of one who was the leader, captain,\r\nor superior of all. In some districts, this man was called maguinòo,\r\nand in others dato. And in proportion as they continued to people\r\nthis archipelago in this manner, it filled up with families and\r\nthey appropriated their places of settlement, each of them seeking\r\nits own convenience for its maintenance and living. And there they\r\nlived governed by their own chiefs, not with a hard and fast rule,\r\nbut all in friendly relations. By virtue of this friendship they were\r\nobliged to aid their chief, both in his wars and in the cultivation\r\nof his fields; and all to aid one another mutually. But no one was\r\nable to usurp the property which belonged to another, even though he\r\nwere of the same barangay.\r\n\r\n466. This barangay consisted of about one hundred persons, more or\r\nless, according to the number that they knew were sufficient for\r\ntheir territory. If perchance those of one barangay did any injury to\r\nanother, cruel wars broke out between them, as broke out between the\r\nchiefs of Manila and Tondo when the Spaniards came in to plant with\r\nthe faith the Catholic dominion, and with it the true peace, which\r\nnow they enjoy with tranquillity. These chiefs or maguinóos, although\r\nsome were so by inheritance, commonly did not get these offices by\r\nvirtue of their blood, but by their merits; or because some one had\r\nmore power, more wealth, more energy, or more moral virtue than any\r\nof the others. This method of government has always seemed so good\r\nto these Indians that it is the form followed in all the villages,\r\nand all the tributes are divided among various heads of barangays,\r\nin accordance with the enumeration of the villages; and those heads\r\nare the ones who look after the collection of the royal income,\r\nand see that the Indians live like Christians. They must also, by\r\nreason of their office, give account to the father minister and the\r\nalcalde-mayor of their province, in case there is any fault to find\r\nwith their respective barangays.\r\n\r\n467. No Indian could pass voluntarily from one barangay to another\r\nwithout the payment of a certain sum, which was established among\r\nthem, and unless he made a great feast to all the barangay which he\r\nleft. It was much more difficult if they were married. If a man of\r\none barangay married a woman from another, the children had to be\r\ndivided between the barangays, as was also done with the slaves.\r\n\r\n468. The classes of people mentioned in that early age by our brother\r\nPlassencia (besides that of chief or dato) are three, as follows. One\r\nclass is that of the nobles, whom they call mahadlìcas. This\r\nword signifies, according to the best vocabularies of the Tagálog\r\nlanguage, those who are free, and who were never slaves. The second\r\nclass are called pechèros; and the third are those who were slaves\r\nlegitimately. Although I find in one vocabulary that mahadlìca is\r\nrendered as \"freedman,\" still I find that freedman is rendered by\r\ntimava in most trustworthy vocabularies. And although in the common\r\npractice of the Tagálog speech, one now says minahadlìca aco nang\r\npanginoongco, that is, \"My master freed me,\" I do not believe that\r\nit is so; for mahadlìca properly signifies \"to give freedom to the\r\nslave,\" only because absolute liberty is its peculiar signification,\r\nand they make use of this term when it was given to a slave. Thus this\r\nterm gives liberty, and the slave remains free from all slavery in the\r\nuttermost of its meaning. It is certain that the term timava is more\r\ncorrectly used to signify the freedman. Consequently, the Tagálog\r\nspeech applies it and uses it, not only to express the liberty of\r\nthe slave, but also for him who breaks the cord at the gallows and\r\nis freed from punishment; and for any fierce animal which makes sport\r\nof bonds. They only lengthen somewhat the accent of the last syllable\r\nin the latter sense, and say nagtitimavà.\r\n\r\n469. The pechèros were the ones called alìping namamahay. Although\r\nin strictness, in the Tagálog, the term alìpin signifies \"slave,\"\r\nthe pechèro was not properly a slave, for he always remained in the\r\nhouse and could not be sold. Consequently, this term could only be\r\napplied to express their method of service, namely, an up-stairs\r\nservant, as I understand it. These pechèros were married. They served\r\ntheir masters, whether datos or not, with the half of their [time\r\nin the] fields, or as was agreed upon at the beginning; and served\r\nthem as rowers. But they lived in their own houses with their wives\r\nand children, and were lords of their property, lands, and gold; and\r\ntheir masters had not the slightest liberty of action or dominion over\r\nthose things. And, even though they should fall by inheritance to a\r\nson of their master, if the former went to live in another village\r\nhe could not take them from their own native village; but they would\r\nserve him in their own village, according to their ability, as they\r\nserved their former master.\r\n\r\n470. The slaves who were strictly such were called alìping sa\r\nguiguilir. This term comes in strict Tagálog to mean the servants\r\nbelow stairs; for the term guilir signifies \"the lower part of\r\nthe house,\" or \"its lower entrance.\" These were bought and sold,\r\nor acquired by war, although those who were born in a family were\r\nseldom sold, for affection's sake. Such served their master in all\r\nthings; but the latter would give them some portion of his field,\r\nif they were faithful and zealous in their labor. If they gained\r\nanything by their industry, they could keep it. If they were slaves\r\nbecause of debt, a condition that was very frequent among them, when\r\nthe debt was paid they were free; but they were also obliged to pay\r\nfor their support and that of their children. At times it was usual\r\nto transfer the debt to another, for the obtaining of some profit;\r\nand the poor wretches remained slaves, even though such was not their\r\ncondition. Much of this is found yet, although not with the rigor\r\nof slavery, but by the force of obligation; but these poor pledged\r\ncreatures suffer a certain kind of slavery in their continuous and\r\ntoilsome service. The authorities ought to employ all their care for\r\nthe uprooting of so keenly felt an abuse.\r\n\r\n471. If perchance these slaves sa guiguilir acquired any gold through\r\ntheir industry, they could ransom themselves with it and become\r\npechèros; and that ransom did not cost so little that it did not amount\r\nto more than five taes of gold, or thereabout. If one gave ten or more,\r\nthen he became free from every claim, and became a noble. For this\r\npurpose a certain ceremony took place between the master and the slave,\r\nnamely, the division between the twain of all the furniture that the\r\nslave used--and that with so great strictness that, if a jar was left\r\nover, they broke it and divided up the bits; and if it were a manta,\r\nthey tore it through the middle, each one keeping half.\r\n\r\n472. From the time when our brother Plassencia explained this\r\ndifference of slaves, many acts of injustice which the Indians\r\npracticed on one another were remedied; for they made slaves of those\r\nwho were never so, because, as the term alìpin is so confused, and\r\nthe alcaldes-mayor did not know the secret, they declared one to be\r\na slave in all rigor, because the Indians proved that he was alìpin,\r\nwhich signifies \"slave,\" being silent, in their malicious reserve,\r\nas to whether he was namamahay or sa guiguilir. There were many such\r\nacts of trickery.\r\n\r\n473. Those born of father and mother who were mahadlìcas were all also\r\nmahadlìcas, and never became slaves except by marriage. Consequently,\r\nif a mahadlìca woman married a slave, the children were divided. The\r\nfirst, third, and fifth belonged to the father, while the mother had\r\nthe second, fourth, and sixth, and they alternated in the same way with\r\nthe other children. If the father were free, then those who pertained\r\nto him were free; but slaves, if he were a slave. The same is to be\r\nunderstood in regard to the mother and her children. If there were\r\nonly one son, or if there were an odd number, so that one was left\r\nover in the division, the last was half free and half slave. However,\r\nit has been impossible to determine at what age the division was made,\r\nor at what time. The slavery of these children followed the native\r\ncondition of their parents in all things, and the children were divided\r\nas they pertained to them, whether they were male or female, as they\r\nwere born. The same thing occurred when one was poor, and did not have\r\nthe wherewithal with which to endow or buy his wife for marriage; and\r\nthen, in order to marry her, he became her slave. Hence it resulted\r\nthat the free children who belonged to the mother were masters and\r\nlords of their own father, and of the children who belonged to the\r\nfather, their own brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n474. If the mahadlìcas had children by their slaves, mother and\r\nchildren were all free. But if the mahadlìca had intercourse with the\r\nslave woman of another, and she became pregnant, the mahadlìca gave the\r\nmaster of the slave woman one-half tae of gold because of the danger\r\nof the death of her who was pregnant, and because that her legitimate\r\nmaster was deprived of the services of the pregnant woman, by reason\r\nof him. When the woman gave birth, one-half the child remained free,\r\nand the father was bound to take care of its support; and, if he did\r\nnot do that, he meant that he did not recognize the child as his,\r\nand it remained all slave.\r\n\r\n475. If any free woman had children by any slave who was not her\r\nhusband, all were free. If a free woman married a half-slave,\r\nthe children were slaves only to the one-fourth part, and they\r\nconsidered that in the question of their service. The service was\r\ndivided among all those who were considered as masters, by weeks or\r\nmonths, or as the masters might agree. But they had the right because\r\nof the parts that were free to compel their masters to free them for\r\na just price, which was appraised in proportion to the character of\r\ntheir slavery. But if one were wholly slave, he could not compel his\r\nmaster to free him for any price, even if he became a slave only for\r\ndebt provided he did not pay the debt at the expiration of the time.\r\n\r\n476. Another form of servitude was found among them, which they called\r\ncabalangay; it included those persons who begged from the chief who\r\nwas head of their barangay whatever they needed, with the obligation\r\nof serving him whenever they were summoned to row, work in his fields,\r\nor serve at his banquets--they helping to meet the expense [of these]\r\nwith the tuba or quilàng, which was their wine. Thus did their headman\r\ngive them what they needed, with this agreement.\r\n\r\n477. This tyranny of slaves was so extensive in this archipelago\r\nthat when our Spaniards conquered it, there were chiefs with so many\r\nslaves--of their own nation and color, and not foreign--that there were\r\nthose who had one, two, and three hundred slaves; and most of these\r\nwere not slaves by birth, but for slight reasons, and even without\r\nreasons. For since their best kind of property, after gold, consisted\r\nin slaves, as their own conveniences were increased considerably by\r\ntheir services, they expended care in nothing to a greater extent than\r\nin increasing the number of their slaves; now by usury and interest,\r\nin which they had no respect for their own parents and brothers and\r\nsisters; now by petty wars and engagements among themselves, in which\r\nthe prisoners became slaves; now by the punishment for some slight\r\ncrime such as for not having observed the interdict on speaking during\r\nthe funeral obsequies, or if anyone passed by the chief's wife while\r\nshe was taking a bath, or if, while the chief was passing by the house\r\nof any timava, some dust accidentally fell on him. Or they were made\r\nslaves because of other reasons, as tyrannical, as trivial, such as\r\nare natural for those who have not the light of the holy gospel.\r\n\r\n478. After this [report of Father Plassencia] was promulgated,\r\nthe above abuse was so thoroughly removed that now there is not the\r\nslightest amount of slavery among the Indians, in accordance with\r\napostolic briefs, which have been confirmed by various royal decrees\r\nof our Catholic monarchs. Thus we are all soldiers of one and the same\r\ndivine Lord; all militia under the holy cross, which is our Catholic\r\nstandard; and citizens and sharers of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is\r\nour kingdom. Thus do we live in these islands, Spaniards and Indians,\r\nall vassals of one Catholic monarch in regard to human matters. This\r\npoint can be seen in extenso in the Politica Indiana of Solorzano in\r\nbook 2, chapter i. [354]\r\n\r\n479. The laws or regulations by which these Indians governed themselves\r\nwere founded on the traditions and customs of their ancestors, which\r\nwere not barbaric in all things as were they. For they were directed\r\nto venerate and obey their parents, and to treat their elders with the\r\ndue respect; and individuals to follow the dictate of the community\r\nof the village; and to punish crimes, etc.\r\n\r\n480. Their judges for this were the chief or dato aided by some old\r\nmen of his own barangay, or of another barangay if necessary. Or\r\nthey themselves appointed a judge-arbiter, even if he were of a\r\ndistinct barangay or village. If there were a suit with rival parties,\r\nthey tried first to come to an agreement. If they would not agree,\r\nan oath was taken from each one, who declared that they would do\r\nas the judges should sentence. Having done that, witnesses were\r\nexamined summarily. If the testimony was equal for each side, then\r\nthe litigants were reconciled. If the evidence were in favor of one\r\nof them, the suit was sentenced in his favor, and the defeated one was\r\nnotified. If he would not admit the sentence willingly, the judge and\r\nall the others proceeded against him, and by way of execution deprived\r\nhim of all the gold to which he had been sentenced. The greater part\r\nof it went to the judges of the case, and to pay the witnesses on\r\nthe victorious side; while the poor litigant had the least of all,\r\nbeing content with only the glory of victory.\r\n\r\n481. Criminal cases were judged according to the rank of the murderer\r\nand the murdered. For if the murdered man were a chief among them all\r\nhis relatives went to the house of his murderer, and the houses of his\r\nrelatives, and they had continual wars one with the other until--the\r\nold men stepped in and acted as mediators, with the declaration of the\r\namount of gold that ought to be given as a payment for that murder. The\r\njudges and the chief old men took one-half that sum, and the other was\r\ndivided among the wife, children, and relatives of the deceased. The\r\npenalty of death was never adjudged except when the murderer and\r\nhis victim were so poor and so destitute that they had no gold for\r\nsatisfaction and expenses. In that case either his own chief or dato\r\nkilled the criminal, or the other chiefs speared him after he had been\r\nfastened to a stake, and made him give up the ghost by spear-thrusts.\r\n\r\n482. In the matter of thefts in which the thief was not known with\r\ncertainty, and those under suspicion were many, they made a sort of\r\ngeneral purgation performed in the following manner. Each one was\r\nobliged to bring in a bundle of cloth, leaves, or anything else in\r\nwhich the stolen article could be hidden. Then the fastenings were\r\nunwound, and if the stolen goods were found in any of them, the\r\nmatter ceased, and no investigation was made as to whom the bundle\r\nbelonged, or who had stolen it. But if the stolen goods were not\r\nfound, the following means were employed. Each suspect was made to\r\nenter a river with a good bottom, staff in hand, and then all at once\r\nplunged under. The first one who came up, because he could no longer\r\nhold his breath, was regarded as the thief of the stolen goods, for\r\nhis remorse of conscience, they said, took away his breath. On that\r\naccount, many were drowned for fear of punishment. The other means\r\nwas to place a stone in a vessel of boiling water, and to order the\r\nsuspects to take it out with the hand, and he who refused to put in\r\nhis hand paid for the theft. Another means was to give them each a wax\r\ncandle with wicks of equal length, and of the same size and weight,\r\nall lit at the same instant; and he whose candle went out first was\r\nregarded as the culprit. Of all this, and in all the other suits and\r\ncivil or criminal causes, the chief took half the gold, and the other\r\nhalf was divided among joint judges and witnesses; and scarce a bit\r\nwas left for the poor creditor, litigant, or owner. This was one of\r\nthe greatest sources of gain to the chiefs and datos, and offered the\r\nbest opportunity for them to exercise their tyranny with the poor,\r\neven were the latter guiltless.\r\n\r\n483. Adultery was not punishable corporally, but the adulterer paid a\r\ncertain sum to the aggrieved party; and that was sufficient so that\r\nthe honor of the latter was restored and his anger removed. They\r\npaid no attention to concubinage, rape, and incest, unless the crime\r\nwere committed by a timava on a woman of rank. On the contrary, the\r\ncommittal of such sins openly was very common, for all of them were\r\nvery much inclined to this excess; but I cannot find that they were\r\naddicted to the sin against nature in the olden time. Verbal insults,\r\nespecially to chiefs, women, and old men, were regarded as deserving\r\nthe severest kind of punishment, and it was difficult to obtain the\r\npardon of the aggrieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n    Of other customs of these peoples, and in regard to their\r\n    marriage, dowries, children, and issue\r\n\r\n\r\n484. It is not known whether these natives divided the time into\r\nhours, days, weeks, months, or years, or made any other division\r\nof time. As this was necessary to them for the reckoning of their\r\ncommerce, trade, and contracts (in which they all engaged), they used\r\nfor reckoning their times of payment, and for other transactions and\r\nbusiness of their government--for the hours, the state of the sun in\r\nthe sky, the crowing of the cock, and the laying time of the hens,\r\nand several other enigmas which are still employed in the Tagálog\r\nspeech. To keep account of the changing of seasons, they knew when it\r\nwas winter or summer by the trees, and their leaves and fruit. They\r\nknew of the division into months or years by moons. Consequently, in\r\norder to designate the date of payment, they said \"in so many moons,\r\nin so many harvests, or in so many fruitings of such and such a\r\ntree.\" These were the methods employed in their trading and government.\r\n\r\n485. The days were reckoned by the name of the sun, namely, arao. Thus\r\nthe Tagálogs now reckon ysang árao, \"one day;\" dalauang árao, \"two\r\n[days],\" and so on until they have the difference of weeks, which\r\nthey call by the name Domingo, saying \"so many Domingos.\" [355] The\r\nnight is called gab-ì; and the day arao, from the name of the sun. The\r\nmonths were named and reckoned by the name of the moon, namely, bovan\r\nin Tagálog. Thus did they divide the seasons after their own manner,\r\nand in their own speech. Only there are no terms to indicate the\r\nhours of the clock [in their speech]; and now the Castilian [names of]\r\nhours are Tagalized, in order to indicate the hours of time. They call\r\nthe clock horasan, that is, \"a thing in which one sees the hours;\"\r\nwhether in its place or in the instrument made for it.\r\n\r\n486. They expressed \"the year\" in their old speech by the word taòn. It\r\nis metaphorical, for it really means \"the assembling of many,\" and\r\nthat they have joined together months to make one year. They had a\r\nword to signify seasons and climates, namely panahon. But they never\r\nknew the word \"time\" [tiempo], in its general sense, and there is\r\nno proper Tagálog word for it; but they use the Spanish word only,\r\ncorrupted after their manner, for they make it tiyempo.\r\n\r\n487. Their business and contracts were for the greater part illegal,\r\nfilled with usury, interest, and tricks; for each one thought only\r\nof increasing his own profits, and paid no attention to his nearest\r\nrelatives. Consequently, loans with interest were very common and\r\ngenerally practiced (and even yet this archipelago is not free from\r\nthis abuse, nor have the difficulties experienced in the confessional\r\nceased); and the interest increases to a very high figure, the debt\r\ndoubling and increasing for so long a time as the debt is delayed,\r\nuntil it results that the debtor, his wealth, and his children, are\r\nall slaves. Their general business was the bartering of one product\r\nfor another (and it is still much in vogue)--food, mantas, birds,\r\nstock, lands, houses, fields, slaves, fisheries, palms, nipa-groves,\r\nwoodlands, and other similar products. Sometimes those products were\r\nsold for a price, which was paid in gold, according to the terms of the\r\nagreement. Thus they traded among themselves with the products of their\r\nown lands, and with foreigners from other nations for products peculiar\r\nto them; and for this they were wont to have their deferred payments,\r\ntheir days of reckoning, and their bondsmen who were concerned\r\ntherein--but with exorbitant profits, because they were all usurers.\r\n\r\n488. In regard to money of silver or gold they did not possess it\r\nin that [early] time. Those metals were employed in their trading\r\nonly by the weight, which was used alone for silver and gold;\r\nand that weight they called talaro, and was indicated by balances,\r\nlike ours. They reckoned and divided by this. And after they learned\r\nabout money they gave to each piece its proper name, taking the coin\r\nthat we call \"tostòn,\" or \"real of four,\" as the basis for greater\r\nsums. This they called salapì, although that is the common term\r\nfor all kinds of money. They divided the salapì into two cahàtis,\r\nthe cahàtis into two seycapat, the seycapat into two seycávalos, the\r\nseycávalo into two calatíos, the calatìo (which they call aliu) into\r\nthe cuding, etc. All this division was regulated by tostòns in this\r\nmanner: the cahàti signifies one-half tostòn; seycàpat, the fourth\r\npart; seycávalo, the eighth; calatìo is the Tagálog cuartillo; [356]\r\nand so on. In order to say \"three reals,\" they say tatlongbahagui,\r\nthat is, three parts of the tostòn. From the tostòn on, they count up\r\nto ten, and from ten to twenty, etc. Consequently, in their language\r\nthey use this expression for ours, saying, \"I ask ten and one more,\"\r\nor \"I ask one for twenty;\" and so on. But now since they know what\r\npesos are, that is, reals of eight, some of them reckon by pesos,\r\nwhich is more familiar to the Spaniards. But most of them do not\r\nforget their salapìs, nor the method of reckoning used by the ancients.\r\n\r\n489. The gold, which they call guinto, was also reckoned by weight. The\r\nlargest weight is the tàhel, which is the weight of ten reals of\r\nsilver--or, as we say, of one escudo. The half-tàhel is called tingà,\r\nwhich is the weight of five reals. The fourth part is called sapaha,\r\nwhich is two and one-half reals. They also used other metaphorical\r\nterms (as the Spanish do the term granos), and said sangsàga, which\r\nis the weight of one red kidney-bean [frixolillo] with a white spot\r\nin the middle.\r\n\r\n490. In order to weigh bulkier things, such as wax, silk, meat,\r\netc., they had steelyards, which they called sinantan, which was\r\nequivalent to ten cates, of twenty onzas [i.e., ounce] apiece. The\r\nhalf of that they called banal, which was five cates; and the half\r\nof the cate they called soco. Consequently, these old weights having\r\nbeen adjusted to the Spanish weights by the regulations of the year\r\n1727, one cale is equivalent to one libra, six onzas; one chinanta\r\nto thirteen libras, and twelve onzas; hence one quintal, of eighty\r\nof the old cates, corresponds to four arrobas and ten libras of our\r\nweight. A pico of one hundred cates is equivalent to five arrobas,\r\ntwelve and one-half libras, in the new arrangement. As in the case\r\nof gold, one tàhel must weigh one and one-fourth onzas in our weight.\r\n\r\n491. In regard to the measures of quantity which the ancients used,\r\nthey were the same as those we now see: cabàn, ganta, half-ganta,\r\nand chupa. The city has regulated them by the Spanish measures in\r\nthe following manner. The caban, which signifies \"box\" [arca] in\r\ntheir own Tagalog speech, is equivalent to one fanega of the standard\r\nof Toledo. The ganta (gantang in Visayan, and salòp in Tagálog) is\r\nequivalent to one half of a Toledo almud, which is the hal-zelemin\r\nin other territories. The half-ganta is equivalent to one cuartillo,\r\nwhich is called pitìs or caguiina in Tagálog. The chupa is the eighth\r\nof the half-almud of Toledo, which is called gàtang in Tagálog, and\r\nalso gahinan, for it is the ration of cleaned rice sufficient for\r\neach meal of a man. The act of measuring in this manner is expressed\r\nby the word tàcal among the Tagálogs. When the king issues orders\r\nfor rice, it is reckoned by cabàns of twenty-four gantas apiece;\r\nand now it is known that it is of pálay rice, which is rice with the\r\nhusk and uncleaned. When vouchers are issued for the stipends and\r\nthe support of the religious ministers, the reckoning is by fanegas,\r\nat the rate of two cabàns of twenty-four gantas each, of the said\r\npálay rice uncleaned. And because his Majesty chooses that they give\r\nit to us very clean, it is now ruled in the royal accountancy that\r\nforty-eight gantas of the fanega of pálay is equivalent to a basket of\r\ntwenty gantas of bigàs, which is the name for cleaned rice. Henge the\r\nking in his charity, in order to give us our sustenance in the rice\r\nwithout waste, gives valuation to the measure at his own pleasure,\r\nfor the rice with husk, so that the quantity may be doubled. The\r\nestimation of the king in this is not the same as looking into the\r\nhollow measure in its strict capacity, as has been already explained.\r\n\r\n492. They also measure by brazas and palmos (but for the vara, I find\r\nno proper Tagálog term, but only the Spanish). The braza is called\r\ndipa; that of the city is of sixty points, into which the six feet\r\ncontained in it are divided. The palmo is called dancal. Tumòro is\r\none jeme. [357] Sangdamàc is the whole width of the hand with the\r\nfive fingers. Sangdali is the width of one finger; and sucat is the\r\nact of measuring in this manner. [358]\r\n\r\n493. So was their usage in their business. Although there are no\r\narithmetical numbers among their characters, such as we use, they\r\ncounted with little stones, making small heaps of them, and made use\r\nof the natural words of their own speech, which are very expressive\r\nin Tagálog; and they did not feel their ignorance of the numbers\r\nwritten in their own characters; for they could express the highest\r\nnumber very clearly by word of mouth.\r\n\r\n494. The maritime folk were wont to go out upon many raids, and those\r\nashore to set strange ambushes for their robberies, to the great loss\r\nof life. Their arms were bow and arrow, and a short lance resembling a\r\ndart, with the iron head of innumerable shapes; and some without iron,\r\nthe points being made from the bamboos themselves, or from stakes\r\nhardened in the fire. They used cutlasses; large and broad daggers,\r\nof excellent quality, with sharp edges; and long blowpipes, through\r\nwhich they discharged arrows dipped in poison. Their defensive arms\r\nwere wooden shields, breastplates of rattan or thick cord, and helmets\r\nof the same material.\r\n\r\n495. Among so many barbaric customs, the universality of their vices\r\nprevailed; and they were infidel, tyrannical, and unchaste. They\r\nregarded virginity as an opprobrium, and there were men who received a\r\nsalary for the office of deflowering [the girls] of their virginity. No\r\nwoman, married or single, assured her honor and credit, unless she had\r\nsome sweetheart; and although this was so honorable for the women, it\r\nwas considered a dishonor to give the liberty of her body freely. Now\r\nthe women are modest in their behavior, but easy, if they are sought,\r\nas the smoke from the fire of their beginnings still endures. At the\r\nbirth of males, and even the females, the midwives themselves made\r\neasier for them the carnal act, by cutting off I know not what from\r\ntheir organs. And now that the midwives do not do it, there is no lack\r\nof the introduction of this abuse among the boys; but it is assured\r\nthat this is not the circumcision of the Jews. The devil influenced\r\nthem in other curious ways for the greater sensuality and duration in\r\ntheir carnal acts, methods which are now completely extinct. But they\r\nhave sufficiently caught the plague of sodomy from the Japanese and\r\nChinese; and I have already seen some persons burned, in my time. In\r\nshort, men and women never think of being chaste, so that among the\r\nmost holy all their thought is of their marriages.\r\n\r\n496. At the present time we have always tried to see that the brides\r\nand grooms are always of equal rank and condition. It was not usual\r\nfor them to have more than one own wife, and one own husband; but\r\nthose who were chiefs and wealthy were allowed to have some slaves as\r\nconcubines, especially if their own wives did not prove fruitful. Only\r\namong the Visayans did the first religious ministers of the gospel find\r\nestablished the custom of one man having many legitimate wives, and\r\nthat of large dowries, which was no small obstruction to the planting\r\nof the gospel. The general rule was for each man to have one legitimate\r\nwife; and they tried to obtain one who was of their own family, and\r\neven very closely related to them, barring out the first degree,\r\nfor that was always a direct impediment to their marriage. Their\r\nmarriages were not indissoluble, as are those of Christians. For if\r\nthe consorts returned the dowry, one to the other, the one at fault\r\nto the one without blame, that was sufficient for repudiation; and\r\nthey could marry others, unless the couple had children, in which\r\ncase all the dowry was given to these. If profits had been made with\r\nthe lapse of time, while they had lived together, those profits were\r\ndivided between them both, if the gains were in common. But if they\r\nwere the secret gains of one of them, then that one kept them.\r\n\r\n497. The dowry, which is called bigaycàya, was always given by the man\r\n(and it is even yet given), the parents of the girl determining the\r\nsum beforehand, at the time when they discussed the marriage. The\r\nparents of the bride received that dowry, and neither the bride nor\r\nher parents contributed any fund. The dowry was set according to the\r\nrank of the contracting parties; and if, perchance, the parents of the\r\nbride asked more than the ordinary sum, they were under obligations\r\nto bestow some gift to the married couple to suit the occasion as,\r\nfor instance, a couple of slaves, some small gold jewel, or a bit of\r\ncleared land--for cultivation, as I have seen practiced even yet,\r\nand which they called pasonòr. In this bigaycaya was included what\r\nthey called panhimùyat, which was the sum that had to be paid to the\r\nmother of the bride in return for her care and labor in the rearing\r\nand education of her daughter. In it was also included the pasòso, or\r\nthe sum that was to be paid to the chichiva, or nurse, who had reared\r\nher. At present, if perhaps there is no bigaycaya in any marriage,\r\nfor any reason, they never fail to collect these revenues from the\r\ngroom, upon which there is generally a suit.\r\n\r\n498. This dowry or bigaycaya was and is given before the marriage with\r\nall the solemnity that they can muster up, amid a great concourse of\r\nmaguinoos, relatives, and friends of the lovers. The latter are given\r\nthe crosses on the money to kiss, which is counted and exhibited\r\nin public, in confirmation of the pact; and then the marriage is\r\nimmediately celebrated with feasting and rejoicing. The employment\r\nof this bigaycaya is not the same in all the villages. In some it is\r\nall converted into the property of the parents of the bride, by way\r\nof trade, they selling their daughter (as do those of Mesopotamia)\r\nfor a reasonable price. If the men do not possess the wherewithal\r\nwith which to buy them promptly, innumerable sins follow and the two\r\nlive in improper relations, even to the knowledge of the parents\r\nthemselves--the young man serving as a servant in the houses of\r\nthe latter to do their will, but in the capacity of a son, as far\r\nas familiarity and permission for evil are concerned. Many efforts\r\nare employed to extirpate this diabolical abuse, but it still costs\r\ngreat toil. Under the title of catipàdos (thus they call those who\r\nare engaged for marriage) are some concubinages legitimate for all\r\ntime, for which the bigaycàya is not necessary. Having given up the\r\nbigaycàya, the poor couple are left destitute, for the parents of\r\nthe bride take charge of everything.\r\n\r\n499. That money is better used in some villages; for it serves to\r\nprovide all kinds of clothes for the bride, and for one-half the\r\nexpenses of the wedding (which are generally very great), and the\r\nparochial fees of the marriage, so that scarcely any is left for the\r\nparents of the couple. This is the practice that I have seen observed\r\nwhere I have been. These and other ogalis (which are customs) can\r\nonly have their origin in the past, and come from father to son,\r\nand even there is variety in them, according to their distinct origins.\r\n\r\n500. That which in España is called \"the exchange of rings,\" in order\r\nto give security to the marriage contract and the wishes of those who\r\nare to contract it, has also been observed here, the couple giving\r\neach other some jewel. This has been called talingbòhol. This was\r\nfollowed by the habìlin, which is the sign that they have given the\r\ndowry which they had promised. And this was like the sign in shops\r\nto show that the price was fixed and that the article could not be\r\nsold at another price. Some fathers have maintained the custom of\r\nasking the same price for their daughter as they paid for the mother\r\nwhen they were married; but as fortunes are unequal, this cannot be\r\nmaintained inexorably, nor at all times, nor with all.\r\n\r\n501. The dowry was never returned to the one who gave it, unless the\r\nson-in-law were so obedient to his parents-in-law that he should win\r\ntheir affection, in which case they returned him the dowry, at the\r\ndeath of any one; but this was rather a matter of charity than of\r\nobligation, as all confess. If the woman who was to be married was\r\nalone, and had neither parents nor grandparents, she herself and no\r\nother received the dowry. At present, the greed of the Indians must\r\nbe greater; for this poor lone woman is never without either the\r\nchichiva who gave her the breast, who will not be left without her\r\npayment, or uncle, aunt, or other relative in whose care she has been\r\nbecause of the loss of her legitimate parents. And since the above\r\nconsider themselves as her parents in this matter (the pinaca ama,\r\nas the Indians call it) they take upon themselves the place of her\r\nparents, and get all the money, just as if they were the true parents.\r\n\r\n502. All the relatives and friends who go to weddings were also\r\nwont to take each some little present. These gifts were set down\r\nvery carefully and accurately, in an account, noting whatever each\r\none gave. For if Pedro So-and-so gave two reals at this wedding,\r\ntwo reals were also given to him if he had another wedding in his\r\nhouse. All this money is spent, either in paying, if anything is due\r\nfor the wedding, or as an aid in the expenses. Or if the parents of\r\nboth the young couple are niggardly, they divide it and keep it. If\r\nthey are generous, they use it in the pamamuhay, or furnishing of\r\nthe house of the couple. Consequently, there is no regular custom\r\nin this. The nearest relatives give the couple a jewel as a mark of\r\naffection, but do not give money. These jewels belong to the bride,\r\nand to no one else.\r\n\r\n503. Three days before the wedding all the relatives of both parties\r\nassemble at the house where it is to be celebrated, to make the\r\npàlapàla, which is a sort of bower, by which they make the house larger\r\nso that all the guests may be accommodated easily. They spend three\r\ndays in making this. The next three days are those customary to the\r\nwedding and its feast. Consequently, there are six days of expense,\r\nof racket, of reveling, of dancing and singing, until they fall\r\nasleep with fatigue and repletion, all helter-skelter without any\r\ndistinction. Often from this perverse river the devil in turn gets\r\nhis little harvest--now in quarrels and mishaps which have happened,\r\nand now in other more common sins; the greatest vigilance of the\r\nfather ministers is insufficient to stop these wrongs, and there are\r\nno human forces (although there ought to be) which can banish these\r\npernicious ogalis.\r\n\r\n504. In the olden days they employed certain ridiculous ceremonies,\r\nwhich had but little decency attending the intercourse of the couple\r\nupon the night of the wedding, customs which have now been totally\r\nuprooted. The least indecent was the coming of the catalona or\r\nbabaylana to celebrate the espousals. They brought a hog for this\r\npurpose, and with it and on it performed their rites as in other\r\nsacrifices. The young couple seated themselves on their bridal bed,\r\nin the laps of certain old women who played the part of godmothers of\r\nthe espousal. These women fed the young couple with their own hands\r\nfrom one dish, and they both drank from one vessel. The groom said that\r\nhe loved the bride, and she that she loved the groom. Thereupon the\r\nshouts of joy broke out, and cries, and there was singing and dancing\r\nand drinking. Then the catalona arose with great gravity, and so many\r\nwere the blessings that she showered down upon the young couple that,\r\naccording to some that I have heard among these natives, they would\r\nexceed without any doubt the flatteries of our gypsy men and women,\r\nwhen they tell the fortune of one who has given them a large reward.\r\n\r\n505. If the recently-married couple did not agree well, the groom\r\ndanced, spear in hand, before a hog, and then gave it the death-thrust,\r\npraying meanwhile to his anito, and this was sufficient to make the\r\nyoung couple agree. Now the couple go in festal procession in the\r\nmanner of a masquerade, to the house where they are to live. Then they\r\nform another such procession, in order to convey the godparents to\r\ntheir abodes, and with this the festival is at an end. And after so\r\ngreat expense, they usually remain indebted for the small parochial\r\nmarriage fees, if the father minister has not been very prompt.\r\n\r\n506. In regard to heirs, all the legitimate children equally inherited\r\nall the property of their parents. If there were no legitimate\r\nchildren, then the nearest relatives inherited. If one had two or\r\nmore children by two wives, all legitimate, each child inherited\r\nwhat belonged to his mother, both of the wealth of her time, and of\r\nthe profits made from it, which could have belonged to her. As to\r\nthe dowry, it is inferred that the child's grandparents received it,\r\nand spent it at the time of the wedding. If there were other children\r\nwho were not legitimate, who had been had by a free woman, they had\r\none-third of the property, and the legitimate children the other two\r\nthirds. But in case that there were no legitimate children, then the\r\nillegitimate children of a free woman were the absolute heirs. Some\r\nproperty was given to the children of slave women according to the\r\nwishes of the legitimate heirs, and the mother became free, as has\r\nbeen stated above--as did the children also, in the manner already\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n507. They were also accustomed to have adopted children, and they are\r\nstill much addicted to this; but the adoption was purchased by the one\r\nadopted, who gave the adopter a certain sum of gold, and, without any\r\nother intricacies of law, the latter kept the one adopted, although\r\notherwise he had his own legitimate father. This was the contract made\r\nin such cases. If the adopter reared the one adopted during his life\r\n(whether he had other children or not), the one adopted was to inherit\r\nthe sum that had been given for his adoption--increased by a like sum,\r\nobtaining in the inheritance twenty, if ten had been given. But if the\r\none adopted died first, the total obligation of the adopter expired,\r\neven to the heirs of the one adopted. Over and above the inheritance\r\nobligation, the adopter generally left the one adopted something else,\r\nsuch as a jewel or a slave, if his services had been good, as a reward\r\nfor his faithfulness and affection. If however, the one adopted was\r\ndisagreeable, the adopter gave him up by giving back the sum that\r\nhad been given for his adoption, and the contract was annulled.\r\n\r\n508. If children were had in adultery, they all lived with the\r\nmother. If the party aggrieved had been paid and satisfied by the\r\nculprit with gold, according to their custom, the children were\r\ndeclared legitimate, and inherited equally with the real legitimate\r\nchildren in the inheritance of the father; but they inherited nothing\r\nfrom the mother. But if the injury were not atoned for, they had no\r\ninheritance, and were not regarded as legitimate.\r\n\r\n509. These children, and those had by one's own slave woman\r\n(notwithstanding the liberty which she and her children enjoyed),\r\nand much less the children had by a slave of another master\r\n(notwithstanding that gold was paid for her during her pregnancy),\r\ndid not succeed to the nobility of their parents, nor to their\r\nprivileges; but were always considered as people of low birth, and\r\nwere enrolled among the timavas in the villages. The legitimate\r\nchildren alone could inherit nobility, and even posts. Hence if\r\nthe father were absolute lord in one barangay, his sons succeeded\r\nto that office, according to priority of birth; and if there were\r\nno sons, then the daughters, and after them the nearest relatives;\r\nand it was unnecessary to appoint or name them in their wills. They\r\nhave never had the custom of making wills, and at most leave a list\r\nof their wealth and obligations. However, the custom is now coming\r\nin of making some testamentary memoranda before the village clerk,\r\nso that it may be legal in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Domingo Zabálburu de Echevarri (see Vol. XVII, p. 294).\r\n\r\n[2] For description of Borneo, see Vol. XXXIII, p. 353, note\r\n419.

João III appointed him captain\r\nof the fortress of San Jorge de Mina, governor of the Portuguese\r\npossessions in Guinea, and (1533) treasurer and general agent for\r\nPortuguese India. An attempt to colonize a grant of land in Brazil\r\n(received 1539) failed, and was abandoned. Barros died in 1570. The\r\nbook referred to in the text was his Decados, a history of Portuguese\r\nIndia, written in fulfilment of a royal commission. The first \"decade\"\r\nwas completed in nine years (1552), the second soon after, and the\r\nthird ten years later. The fourth was left unfinished at his death,\r\nbut was completed later by Diogo do Conto, who added eight more\r\nvolumes. A complete edition was printed at Lisbon in twenty-four\r\nvolumes (1778-88). Barros was a conscientious writer and a good\r\nstylist. (New International Encyclopædia.)\r\n\r\n[4] An apparent error for the word \"kasis,\" and here wrongly used\r\n(see Vol. XVI, p. 134, note 161).\r\n\r\n[5] Thus (sur) in text; but, as a matter of fact, Paragua stretches\r\nnortheast from the north point of Borneo, and the Sulu archipelago\r\nin the same direction from its northeast side.\r\n\r\n[6] Sumatra is on the whole deficient in lakes. The largest is Lake\r\nSingkara, about twenty miles in length by about twelve to fifteen in\r\nbreadth, with a depth of twenty-four fathoms, and is the source of the\r\nIndragiri River. Another lies near the foot of the mountain Mârapi,\r\nand is called Danau Sapuluh kota, or \"Lake of the ten forts.\" There are\r\ntwo others in the country of the Korinchi Malays; and still another\r\nin the country of the Lampungs, toward Java, and called the Ranu\r\n(Javanese synonym for \"water\"). It is about sixteen miles long and\r\neight miles wide. Colin evidently refers to either the first or the\r\nlast of these. See Crawfurd's Dictionary, p. 416.\r\n\r\n[7] India citra Gangem (if we accept Marco Polo's division) would\r\ncorrespond to Greater India, or the country extending from the\r\nGanges to the Indus. India extra Gangem, or Lesser India, included the\r\nterritory between the eastern coast of the peninsula of India, and that\r\nof Cochinchina or Champa. See Wright's edition of Travels of Marco\r\nPolo (London and New York, 1892), p. 435, note. Colin says (p. 1),\r\nthat India extra Gangem or Farther India included the coasts of the\r\nrich kingdoms of Malacca, Sian, Camboja, Champa, Cochinchina, Tunquin,\r\nand China, as far as the confines of Oriental Tartary. The allusion\r\nto an Asiatic Ethiopia is hopelessly confused, and may have arisen\r\nfrom Marco Polo's second division of India, which includes Abyssinia.\r\n\r\n[8] Of the Manguianes, or more properly the Mangyan, Pardo de Tavera\r\nsays in Etimologia de las nombres de razas de Filipinas (Manila,\r\n1901): \"In Tagálog, Bícol, and Visaya, manguian signifies 'savage,'\r\n'mountaineer,' 'pagan negroes.' It may be that the use of this word\r\nis applicable to a great number of Filipinos, but nevertheless it\r\nhas been applied only to certain inhabitants of Mindoro. In primitive\r\ntimes, without doubt, the name was even then given to those of that\r\nisland who to-day bear it, but its employment in three Filipino\r\nlanguages shows that the radical ngian had in all these languages\r\na sense to-day forgotten. In Pampango this radical ending still\r\nexists and signifies 'ancient,' from which we can deduce that the\r\nname was applied to men considered to be the ancient inhabitants,\r\nand that these men were pushed back into the interior by the modern\r\ninvaders in whose languages they are called the 'ancients.'\" They\r\nlive in the mountains of Mindoro and are probably a mixture of the\r\nNegritos with other Filipinos, and possibly in some localities there\r\nmay be a small infusion of white blood. They are non-Christian,\r\nand are very timid. Their dress consists of the \"gee\" string, with\r\nthe addition, in the case of the younger girls, of some forty or\r\neighty yards of bejuco (rattan) wrapped around the waist. They are\r\ndivided into several tribes, chief among which are the \"Buquit,\"\r\n\"Bangon,\" and \"Batanganes,\" who roam in bunches or by families, the\r\noldest acting as chief. They are willing workers, and make nearly\r\nall the bancas used in the province. They have no knowledge whatever\r\nof agriculture, and do not know the value of money. The census of\r\n1903 shows a population of 7,269. See Census of the Philippines, i,\r\npp. 472, 473, 547, and 548; and ii, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[9] The Chinese carried on a fairly active trade in the Philippines\r\nthree centuries before Magellan's discovery of the archipelago. The\r\narticles traded by them for the products of the country consisted of\r\npottery, lead, glass beads, iron cooking-pans, and iron needles. Some\r\nof them may have gone north above Manila.

Colin also gives the same in the Visayan\r\ntongue, but as it differs so slightly from the version as given\r\nby Chirino (\"ginoon\" in place of \"guinoon,\" line 2, second word;\r\n\"sancta,\" in place of \"santa,\" line 5, first word; \"Ynahan\" in place\r\nof \"inahan,\" line 5, third word; \"macasala\" in place of \"macasasala\"\r\nline 6, fourth word; and \"camatay\" in place of \"camatai,\" last line,\r\nfourth word), it is omitted here (see ut supra, p. 239).

This is why the first missionaries did not deprive the natives of\r\nthis name when they instructed them about the existence of God and the\r\nmysteries of the Trinity, the incarnation, and redemption, as states an\r\nanonymous but very circumstantial relation written at Manila, on April\r\n20, 1572. This is more evident in the song which the Mandayan baylanas\r\nuse in their sacrifices, when they chant the Miminsad, saying: [Here\r\nfollow the words of this song, for which consult our Vol. XII, p. 270,\r\nnote.] ... The Mandayas believe that Mansilatan is the father of Batla\r\n(man being a prefix which indicates paternity, being, or dominion),\r\nand the Búsao who takes possession of the baylanas when they tremble,\r\nand of the Baganis when they become furious; it is a power which is\r\nderived from Mansilatan.... This interpretation of the word Bathala\r\nis confirmed by that word of the Visayans, Diuata; we always find here\r\nthe same idea signified in the words Diwa and uata, differing only in\r\ntheir transposition.... In closing, we may note that Dewa in Malay,\r\nDéwa in Javanese, Sunda, Makasar, and Day[ak?], Deva in Maguindanao,\r\nand Djebata in Bornean, signify 'the supreme God,' or 'Divinity.'\"\r\n\r\n[24] The caverns were, in especial, formerly the usual sepulchres of\r\nthe Indians.

When one hears a lizard 'sing,' as the Spaniards\r\ncall the cry, it means, among the Ilocanos, an important visit of\r\nsome kind. If hunting at the time one hears several lizards sing,\r\nhe must turn back immediately, as disaster will inevitably follow\r\nfurther progress.

At the age of twelve he entered the Jesuit order as a novice,\r\nat Tarragona; after six years of study there, he wished to enter\r\nthe Philippine missions, and was therefore sent to Mexico to await\r\nan opportunity for going to the islands. This did not come until\r\n1643, when Diego de Bobadilla went from Acapulco with forty-seven\r\nJesuit missionaries, of whom Combés was one; five of these died in an\r\nepidemic, which carried away one hundred and fifteen of the people on\r\nthe ship. Combés completed his theological studies at Manila, and was\r\nordained in 1645, being soon afterward sent to Zamboanga. He remained\r\nin Mindanao twelve years, often acting as ambassador of the governors\r\nto Corralat and other Moro chiefs, and ministering in various places;\r\nin 1657 he returned to Manila, where he spent two years, and then three\r\nyears in Leyte. He was then recalled (1662) to Manila, and tried to\r\ninduce the authorities there to maintain the forts in the Moro country;\r\nbut his efforts failed. In 1665 he was sent as procurator for his order\r\nto Madrid and Rome; but he died on the voyage, December 29 of that\r\nyear. (Retana and Pastells's ed. of Hist. de Mindanao, col. vi-xix.)\r\n\r\n[30] Of the Caragas, Blumentritt says (Tribes of the Philippines,\r\nMason's translation, p. 535): \"In older works are so named the warlike\r\nand Christian inhabitants of the localities subdued by the Spaniards\r\non the east coast of Mindanao, and, indeed, after their principal\r\ncity, Caraga. It has been called, if not a peculiar language,\r\na Visaya dialect, while now only Visaya (near Manobo and Mandaya)\r\nis spoken, and an especial Caraga nation is no longer known.\" It is\r\nquite probable that the term Caragas was only a local name applied\r\nby the people of this district to themselves or applied to them by\r\nthe Spaniards; and if they ever did exist as a separate people they\r\nhave been completely absorbed by the surrounding peoples.\r\n\r\n[31] The Mindanaos (properly Maguindanaos, \"people who come from the\r\nlake\") are mentioned by Pigafetta (Vol. XXXIII, p. 239); they live\r\nnow, as formerly, principally about the Rio Grande, and they gave\r\nname to the island of Mindanao. They are Mahometan Moros and were the\r\nchief obstacle of the Spaniards in Mindanao, but were finally brought\r\nunder control by General Weyler, and their power and importance is\r\nnow almost gone. Their political achievements are the only ones of\r\nconsequence ever made by peoples of the Philippines. See Census of\r\nPhilippine Islands, i, pp. 466-467.\r\n\r\n[32] Blumentritt (Tribes of the Philippines) identities the Lutaos\r\nwith the Mono of the district of Zamboanga, who are frequently called\r\nIlanos, and adds that the name appears to be the Hispanicized form\r\nof the Malay Orang-Laút (\"Men of the Sea\"). The description given\r\nby Combes fits rather the Orang-Laút themselves than the Ilanos, who\r\nlive along the seacoast west of Malabang, and are few in number. The\r\nOrang-Laút, called also \"Sea Gypsies,\" \"Bajau\" and \"Sámal-Laút\"\r\n(\"Sámal of the Sea\") are found throughout the Malay Archipelago\r\n(in the Philippines along southern Mindanao and throughout the Sulu\r\nArchipelago), and live for mouths in their small boats. Their original\r\nhome was Johore and the islands in the strait of Malacca; and they are\r\nonly imperfectly Mahometanized, some being quite pagans. The Sámal\r\nliving in towns in Zamboanga and the Sulu Archipelago are probably\r\ndescendants of the Sámal-Laút who have abandoned their wandering\r\nlife. See Census of the Philippines, i, pp. 464, 475, 476, 563.\r\n\r\n[33] The Subanon (Spanish form \"Subanos\"), or \"Men of the Rivers\"\r\nare an important pagan tribe of western Mindanao, who are found in the\r\nmountains of Zamboanga, and extending eastward slightly into Cottabato,\r\nMisamis, and Dapitan. For a modern description that agrees essentially\r\nwith that of Combés, see Census of the Philippines, i, pp. 552-560.\r\n\r\n[34] Spanish, redentor; in religious orders, the father appointed\r\nto attend to the ransoming and return of Christians held captive by\r\nMahometan enemies.\r\n\r\n[35] Antonio de Abarca, S.J., was born in Villalba in the diocese of\r\nCuenca, September 13, 1610. He entered the Society March 23, 1628,\r\nwent to the Philippines in 1632, and took his final vows, January\r\n21, 1649. He was a missionary in Mindanao and the Visayan Islands,\r\nand rector of Carigara and Cebú. While going to Rome as procurator,\r\nhe died at sea (January 23, 1660), near Acapulco. (Combés, Pastells\r\nand Retana ed., col. 694.)\r\n\r\n[36] This chief is called timoly by the Subanos; hari-hari by the\r\nMandayas; masali campo, by the Monteses; matado, by the Manobos;\r\nbagani, by the Bagobos; and dato and sultán by the Mahometans and\r\nMoros. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 655.)\r\n\r\n[37] The so-called Dapitan nation was a Visayan tribe and lived in\r\nMindanao in the present comandancia of Dapitán in the province of\r\nMisámis. Strictly speaking they can be called a distinct tribe with\r\nno greater accuracy than can the Caragas. See Blumentritt's Tribes\r\nof the Philippines (Mason's translation); and Pastells and Retana's\r\nCombés, col. 779.\r\n\r\n[38] Baclayón is a village on the extreme southwest coast of\r\nBohol.

See Vol. XXXIV, pp. 39, 153.\r\n\r\n[40] The text which we follow reads \"y quan a fauor de sus\r\nnueuas.\" \"Nueuas\" may possibly be a misprint for \"navios,\" in which\r\ncase the phrase would read \"how much at the mercy of their ships.\"\r\n\r\n[41] Even yet infidels abandon a house in which the head of the\r\nfamily has died. Father Pastells says that while crossing the island\r\nof Mindanao with Father Heras in 1878, one Sálug died in the house of\r\nSilungan, a freedman recently redeemed by the said missionaries. He was\r\nbaptised before death by Father Pastells. Silungan demanded from the\r\nreligious the value of the house, which he proposed to abandon. The\r\nfathers, however, answered him that since the freedman had died with\r\nbaptism, the house was purified. This satisfied the heathens, and\r\nthey did not insist on their demand. (Pastells and Retana's edition\r\nof Combés, note 13, col. 655.)\r\n\r\n[42] This refers to Legazpi's and not Magallanes's expedition. Pagbuaya\r\nmade friendship with the former, and gave him a pilot to guide him to\r\nthe inland of Panglao. In book two of Combés's Historia, chapter II,\r\nis related rightly the occurrence with regard to the king of Borneo,\r\nafter the arrival of Legazpi. Combés says that the Dapitans imagined\r\nthat the Spaniards were eating fire when they smoked, and the hard\r\nwhite sea-biscuits they imagined to be stones. The noise of the\r\nartillery they took to be thunder, and the sword with which each one\r\nwas girt, they thought to be a tail.\r\n\r\n[43] The term \"Malanao\" is derived from \"ma,\" \"people of\" and \"lanao,\"\r\n\"lake,\" and has long been used to distinguish the Moros living on\r\nthe watershed of Lake Lanao. See Census of the Philippines, i, p. 473.\r\n\r\n[44] In 1596, Fathers Valerio de Ledesma and Manuel Martinez first\r\nestablished the mission of the River of Butuan. That same year,\r\nthere not being as yet any division into bishoprics, the Manila\r\necclesiastical cabildo (as the see was vacant), gave Mindanao into the\r\nformal possession of the Society of Jesus, an act that was confirmed\r\nby Francisco Tello, as viceroyal patron. Later, the question of\r\nthe jurisdiction about Lake Malanao was argued in court between the\r\nJesuits and Recollects, and was decided in favor of the former by\r\nJuan Niño de Tabora, a sentence confirmed by Corcuera September 5,\r\n1637. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, cols. 655, 656.)\r\n\r\n[45] The bay of Panguil or Pangil takes its name from a fruit, pangi\r\n(Hidnocarpus polyandra--Bl.), which is carried down to the coast by\r\nthe rivers. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 759.)\r\n\r\n[46] The Manobos are a Malay head-hunting heathen tribe of northern\r\nMindanao who live in the interior about the watershed of the Agusan\r\nRiver. \"Manobo\" is a native word, which, in the Bagobo language of\r\nthe gulf of Dávao, means \"man.\" Blumentritt (with whom Retana agrees)\r\nsays that the correct form of the name is \"Manuba\" or \"Man-Suba,\" i.e.,\r\n\"river-people.\" The term might possibly be extended to the mountain\r\npeople of Misamis province. See Census of the Philippines, i, pp. 461,\r\n473; Blumentritt's Tribes of the Philippines (Mason's translation);\r\nand Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 780.\r\n\r\n[47] Blumentritt (Tribes of the Philippines, Mason's translation) says\r\nof the Mananapes: \"A heathen people alleged to dwell in the interior\r\nof Mindanao, possibly a tribe of Buquidnones or Manobos.\" Retana\r\n(Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 780) says that the appellation is\r\nequivalent to \"Manap,\" and is not the name of a tribe, but merely a\r\nnickname to indicate that those bearing that name are wild like beasts.\r\n\r\n[48] Retana (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 780), derives\r\n\"Sameacas\" from \"Sumasacas,\" a word which he says is equivalent to\r\nthe Visayan \"tagasaca,\" \"people of the uplands.\" According to him,\r\nthey are Malayan Moros, but Montero y Gay (Blumentritt's Tribes of\r\nPhilippines, Mason's translation) says that they are heathen. It should\r\nbe observed that Retana is not always a safe guide in etymological\r\nand ethnological matters.\r\n\r\n[49] This entire sentence is, like many others of Combés, of loose and\r\nvague construction. Apparently what he means is, that the Lutaos had,\r\nlike the Javanese, a polite and a vulgar tongue; and that the former\r\nmore closely resembles the Sanskrit (since he implies that the Lutaos\r\ncame from India).\r\n\r\n[50] The Spaniards, mindful of their own struggles with the Moors of\r\nSpain (Moros) called all Mahometan peoples Moors.\r\n\r\n[51] See Vol. XXXVI, p. 174, note 33.\r\n\r\n[52] A classic allusion, occasioned by the marine life and habits of\r\nthe Lutaos.\r\n\r\n[53] Paguian Tindig is equivalent to \"just king.\" In their literal\r\nsense, both words signify \"he who causes persons and things to pass\r\nby the right path.\" (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 727.)\r\n\r\n[54] Elsewhere written Limansacay; see Vol. IV, pp. 241-278, the\r\naccount of Gabriel de Ribera's expedition against the Mindanaos\r\nin 1579.\r\n\r\n[55] Such was the first outbreak of hostilities which caused the\r\nrebellion of the Moros of Joló against Spain, and originated the\r\npiracy of that small archipelago, which wrought so much ruin, and\r\ncaused so much bloodshed and depopulation among the Visayan and\r\nTagálog islands. (Pastells and Retanas Combés, col. 658.)\r\n\r\n[56] Regarding the introduction of Mahometanism in those islands,\r\nsee Vol. IV, pp. 150, 151, 168, 178.\r\n\r\n[57] A common name for the mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana), a fruit\r\nof delicate flavor and highly prized; this tree grows in Joló and\r\nMindanao.

When the princes of Joló swear by this\r\nbecoquin, using this ceremony, it is the strongest oath that they can\r\ntake, and that which is most respected.\" (Combés, Hist. de Mindanao,\r\ncol. 478, 785.)\r\n\r\n[59] The limocon (Calcophups indica) is a species of turtledove with\r\nred feet and beak. It is very beautiful, its plumage being green on\r\na white background. See Delgado's Historia, p. 830.\r\n\r\n[60] There are offerings and sacrifices among the Mindanao heathen. The\r\nfirst [pagcayog] consist in offering rice, buyo, and money before\r\na small idol of bayog [Pterospermum] wood (placed on a small altar\r\nadorned with bamboo and bonga [Areca]), called diuata or Manáug. This\r\nidol, which is a poorly-made image, has for eyes the red fruit of the\r\ntree called mabugaháy, and is painted with the sap of the narra. The\r\nblood sacrifices are of animals, and even of human beings. The\r\nfirst are called talíbong, if the animal sacrificed is a cock,\r\nand pag-balílig, if it is a hog. In either case, the priestesses\r\n(bailanes) having assembled, to the sound of the agun and guímbao,\r\nare clad according to rule; that is, with embroidered handkerchiefs on\r\nthe head; magnificent red shirts, rich glass beads hanging from the\r\nneck; silver medals fastened to the breast; large gold earrings with\r\nstrings of beads; a jabol or dagmay which serves them as a skirt, and\r\nis very skilfully woven and figured with crocodiles and other designs;\r\nat the girdle, in the midst of fragrant flowers and hawk's-bells,\r\nthey carry the balarao or dagger with which the sacrifice of the\r\nvictim is made; on the arms precious bracelets of ságai-ságai and\r\npamóans; and on the feet hoops and hawk's-bells, which sound in\r\ncadence with the dance which legalizes such ceremonies. When the\r\npriestesses have taken their places about the altar, upon which\r\nthe victim is to be sacrificed, they commence their dances to the\r\nsound of the culintangan, some of them playing on the guimbao and\r\nthe agun. They walk about the altar; they tremble and belch, while\r\nsinging the \"miminsad,\" until they fall senseless to the ground like\r\nthose stricken with epileptic fits. Then the spectators go to them,\r\nfan them, sprinkle them with water, and the other women bear them\r\nup in their arms until they recover consciousness. Then they repeat\r\nthe ceremony and the chief priestess buries her balarao in the\r\nheart of the hog or slits the cock's neck. Thereupon, she sucks up\r\nthe blood which gushes forth from the victim, partaking thus of the\r\nsacrifice. The other bailanes do the same. During the epileptic fit,\r\nthey assert that Mansilatan has appeared to them and notified them\r\nof the good or ill outcome of the war, sickness, harvest, or whatever\r\nthey have been investigating. Then it all ends in excessive eating and\r\ndrinking. The human sacrifice is called huaga, and is only practiced\r\namong the Bagobos and most barbarous heathen of Mindanao. The victim\r\nis offered to the Mandarangan, the god of the mountain or volcano of\r\nApo; this person's value is generally apportioned among those who\r\nparticipate in the sacrifice, and he who pays most is the first to\r\nwound the unfortunate victim. The latter is cut into mincemeat in a\r\nmoment amid the horrifying cries of his infamous executioners. Thanks\r\nto the painstaking vigilance of the authorities of that district, and\r\nto the incessant care of the missionaries, so impious and criminal\r\na ceremony is almost entirely eradicated, and is only practiced\r\nin secret, in the densest woods. In addition to the huaga, there\r\nare true cases of cannibalism among the Baganis, who are wont to\r\neat the raw entrails of those who fall before their lances, krises,\r\nand balaraos in battle. They do that as a mark of bravery. They have\r\na proverb which says: \"I am long accustomed to eat the entrails of\r\nmen.\" (Pastells and Retana's Combés, cols. 657, 658.)\r\n\r\n[61] Referring to Tuambaloca, the queen of Raya Bongso; Bactial\r\n(misprinted Bachal in the Combés text) was his bastard son, who for\r\na time ruled Joló, during his father's life.\r\n\r\n[62] These patolas are mentioned by Pigafetta in his relation. See\r\nVol. XXXIV, p. 59.\r\n\r\n[63] A measure of capacity equivalent to about one-half an English\r\ngallon, or two liters.\r\n\r\n[64] This last sentence is in the language of the Inquisition,\r\nthe original being \"y aun entre barbaros puso con sambenito\r\nal vicioso, para que no tengan escusa los que se le hizieron\r\nFamiliares.\" \"Sambenito\" (translated \"penance\") is the \"garment worn by\r\npenitent convicts of the Inquisition;\" or \"an inscription in churches,\r\ncontaining the name, punishment, and signs of the chastisement of\r\nthose doing penance.\"\r\n\r\n[65] The dedo is a measure equivalent to one forty-eighth of the vara\r\nor Spanish yard.\r\n\r\n[66] Father Pastells has seen the immediate effects of the execution\r\nof judgment by boiling water, and cured a young man, who had thrust\r\nhis hand into boiling water, by sentence of the chiefs, in order to\r\nprove his innocence. The judgment of plunging the parties into water\r\nis also practiced, and he who remains in the water the shortest time\r\nis adjudged the criminal. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 659.)\r\n\r\n[67] These prices are mentioned in Vol. XLI, appendix.\r\n\r\n[68] One of the chief causes of the great depopulation of Mindanao\r\nand the Visayan Islands was the slavery produced by the piracy of the\r\nLutaos, encouraged by the Moros of Borneo, Célebes, Gilolo, Macazar,\r\nTernate, and the other Moluccas, who brought the slaves in the markets\r\nto which they were conveyed. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 659.)\r\n\r\n[69] The Baganis, who dress in the manner described by the author,\r\ngenerally count the number of their victims, by placing on the edge of\r\nthe shield as many locks of hair as the assassinations that they have\r\ncommitted. One Macusang gave Father Pastells his shield as a present,\r\nas a sign that he would kill no more Christians; and that shield held\r\none hundred and eight locks of hair. (Pastells and Retana's Combés,\r\ncol. 659.)\r\n\r\n[70] Now called bido. They dress like women; and some think them\r\nhermaphrodites. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 659.)\r\n\r\nHenry Ling Roth, in his Natives of Sarawak and British North Borneo\r\n(London, 1896), i, pp. 270, 271, describes these men in women's attire\r\nas found in Borneo, where they are called Manang bali. Before such\r\nassume women's dress they are unsexed; and thenceforth they endevour\r\nto imitate as nearly as possible the women in everything, he who\r\ncan best do so being regarded as the most successful. Their services\r\nare in great demand and they generally grow wealthy, when in order\r\nthe better to act their assumed character as women, the manang bali\r\ntakes a husband. The latter is despised by the women and disliked by\r\nthe men of the tribe, and is completely under his so-called \"wife's\"\r\ndomination. Men are not brought up in this office as a profession, but\r\none becomes a manang bali from pure choice, or by sudden inclination,\r\nat a mature age. He is always a person of great consequence in the\r\nvillage, and may become the chief. He has many cares, and acts often\r\nas a peacemaker, in which he excels, all little differences being\r\nbrought to him. His wealth is often at the service of his followers,\r\nand he is ready to help in times of trouble and distress. When the\r\nmanang bali marries, he generally adopts some children; and if he\r\nhas had children before he becomes a manang bali, he must give them\r\ntheir portions and start in that career unencumbered.\r\n\r\nCf. the \"berdashes\" among the North American Indians; see Jesuit\r\nRelations (Cleveland reissue), lix, pp. 309, 310.\r\n\r\n[71] Retana (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 786) derives \"labia\"\r\nfrom \"labi\" and \"a\" \"he who advantages the others.\" \"Tuto\" is said by\r\nRetana (ut supra, col. 790) to be equivalent to \"tuud-tuud\" meaning\r\n\"in real truth.\"\r\n\r\n[72] Either the eleventh or twelfth of November.

It is about\r\n11 × 9 miles in extent, and is low, but is densely inhabited and\r\nhas considerable trade with Joló. It has some settlements of the\r\nSámals, the descendants of the Sámal Laút or \"sea gypsies.\" See\r\nU. S. Philippine Gazetteer, and Census of the Philippine Islands, i,\r\np. 464.\r\n\r\n[74] At present, when anyone dies, those of his house break out into\r\nuncontrollable lamentations, and the father or husband becomes so\r\nbeside himself at times that, seizing his bolo, he slashes right and\r\nleft whatever he finds, destroying his clothes, furniture, utensils,\r\nand even the very floor of the house; and it is necessary to lay\r\nhold of him in order to avoid a worse ending to such uncontrolled\r\nactions. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 660.)\r\n\r\n[75] Socsocan (Sofocan, Sogsocan) was a Basilan by birth and one of\r\nthe most esteemed of Corralat's chiefs. He became friendly to the\r\nSpaniards and served them well as commander of the Lutaos. His name\r\nis said to signify \"he who penetrates the fortresses or the ranks of\r\nthe enemy.\" (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 735.)\r\n\r\n[76] Captain Gaspar de Morales was made admiral of the squadron in\r\nJoló. He fought bravely in La Sabanilla and in Joló, where he was\r\nseverely wounded. He became commandant of the stronghold and afterward\r\nwas governor of the Joloan fort. As governor he was an utter failure;\r\nfor by his avarice and licentiousness he occasioned the insurrection\r\nof Salibansa (whose daughter he had seized), and the loss of the Sulu\r\narchipelago for more than two centuries. (Pastells and Retana's Combés,\r\ncol. 723.)\r\n\r\n[77] Among woods of extraordinary hardness is the magconó (Xanthostemon\r\nverdugonianus naves). This wood is so hard that if a nail be driven\r\ninto its heart and it be afterward sawn apart, one does not observe\r\nwhere the saw strikes the nail, and it said that both substances are of\r\nequal hardness. Father Pastells asserts that he has seen bits of this\r\nwood that have been converted into real flint after only twenty-five\r\nyears. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 660.)\r\n\r\n[78] Of these people, properly called Guimbajanos (Guinbajanos,\r\nGuimbanos, Guimbas, and Quimpanos), Blumentritt (Tribes of the\r\nPhilippines, Mason's translation) says: \"The historians of the\r\nseventeenth century, under this title, designated a wild, heathen\r\npeople, apparently of Malay origin, living in the interior of Sulu\r\nIsland. Their name is derived from their war drum (guimba). Later\r\nwriters are silent concerning them. In modern times the first mention\r\nof them is by P. A. de Pazos and by a Manila journal, from which\r\naccounts they are still at least in Caroden and in the valley of\r\nthe Loo; it appears that a considerable portion of them, if not the\r\nentire people, have received Islam.\" Retana (Pastells and Retana's\r\nCombés, col. 779) derives the name of these people from guimba,\r\n\"a mountain.\" They are not mentioned under this name by the Census\r\nof the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[79] Pedro de Almonte Vérastegui, of Sevilla, was a brave soldier,\r\nwho served as general and sargento-mayor, and admiral of an expedition\r\nagainst Maluco. He was especially distinguished for his honesty and\r\nuprightness. In Sibuguey he attained equal merit with Corcuera, and\r\nin 1638 conquered Joló. Diego Fajardo assigned him the encomienda\r\nof Lorenzo Cañete, left vacant (July 1, 1645), by the death of the\r\nlatter's son. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 695.) Almonte\r\nVérastegui has often been mentioned in this series.\r\n\r\n[80] The Chinese, during the Spanish régime of the Philippines, were\r\nallowed to smoke opium under certain rules; but its use was prohibited\r\nto the natives, although it was at times used secretly. (Pastells\r\nand Retana's Combés, col. 781.)\r\n\r\n[81] The former officer of the crown of Aragon, who was assigned to\r\nduty immediate to the king's person. He enjoyed several privileges,\r\none of them being to hold the royal sword naked in public\r\nceremonies. (Dominguez, Diccionario nacional.)\r\n\r\n[82] The arms of the natives of Mindanao, like their clothes,\r\nare manufactured by themselves. The spears and campilans are said\r\nto be finely tempered. They themselves adjust the dies for their\r\npataquias. The sheaths, like the hafts of their krises, are of gold\r\nrichly engraved. The haft of the kris used by Dato Ayuman of Tabiran\r\nwas of solid gold, and was engraved with sentences from the Koran\r\nin Arabic characters. The usual weapons are: campilans, krises\r\n(straight and wavy), machetes, bolos, ligdaos, súndanes, various\r\nkinds of spears, balaraos, and badis. They use coats-of-mail made\r\nof brass, tortoise-shell, malibago [-bark], or very thick cloth, or\r\nlong sashes wound about the breast. Spears and arrows are generally\r\npoisoned with the resin of the tree called quemandag or the poison of\r\nred ants or scorpions; and the points of their daggers and balaraos\r\nare also poisoned. They also use darts made of steel, iron, bone,\r\npalm-wood and bamboo. For defense they construct traps, dig pits,\r\nand set bamboo points. They use also various kinds of lantacas and\r\nother kinds of firearms, with which the Chinese supply them, or which\r\nthey manufacture themselves. These were considered contraband of war\r\nduring the Spanish régime. (Pastells and Retana's Combés, col. 782.)\r\n\r\n[83] Juan José Delgado was a native of Cadiz; the time of his birth is\r\nnot known. In 1711 he left Spain for Filipinas, and perhaps remained\r\nfor some time in Mexico: it is probable that he reached Filipinas\r\nas early as 1717. He seems to have spent most of his life in the\r\nVisayan Islands--Sámar, Cebú, Leyte, etc.--but to have visited most\r\nof the peoples in the archipelago at some time or other. His Historia\r\nwas written during the years 1751-54; the date of his death is not\r\nknown. See sketch of his life in the Historia (Manila, 1892), pp. x-xi.\r\n\r\n[84] Mas used the MS. of the Museo-Biblioteca de Ultramar, which is\r\nwrongly dated. See post, pp. 278-280. Of the letter itself he says (i,\r\n\"Poblacion\" p. 63): \"These paragraphs and other ancient documents\r\nwill show us ... how little the individuals who now occupy us have\r\nchanged since that time.\"\r\n\r\n[85] For instance, Mas says (p. 63): \"Here follows what the author of\r\nthe celebrated work on the Philippines, called Cronicas franciscanas\r\n[referring to San Antonio's Chronicas] says: 'The very reverend father,\r\nFray Gaspar de San Agustin, an Augustinian from Madrid,'\" etc. Bowring\r\nmakes this: \"Among the most celebrated books on the Philippines are the\r\n'Cronicas Franciscanas' by Fr. Gaspar de San Agustin, an Augustine\r\nmonk of Madrid;\" and following gives the impression that he makes\r\nthe selections directly from San Agustin--a ridiculous error.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the word \"monk\" used by Bowring, that author is again in\r\nerror, technically at least, an error that is quite often met with\r\nin many works. As pointed out by Rev. T. C. Middleton, O.S.A., in a\r\nletter dated December 8, 1902, the only regulars in the Philippines\r\nwho could rightfully be styled \"monks\" were the Benedictines. The\r\nmembers of the other orders are \"friars,\" the equivalent of the Spanish\r\n\"frailes.\" The monks are strictly cloistered. The friars appeared first\r\nin the thirteenth century, and do not live a strictly cloistered life.\r\n\r\n[86] M. reads on the outside wrapper: \"Letter by Fray Gaspar de San\r\nAgustin;\" and the heading of the letter is as follows: \"+ Letter\r\nwritten by an aged religious of Philipinas to a friend in España,\r\nwho asked him as to the nature and characteristics of the Indian\r\nnatives of these islands.\" D. reads: \"Letter written by the very\r\nreverend father Fray ... giving him an account ...\"\r\n\r\n[87] M. and D. read \"mathematical side;\" and continuing D. reads\r\n\"of the double of the cube of the sphere.\"\r\n\r\n[88] i.e., \"I was with this generation for about forty years, and I\r\nsaid 'These people always err from the heart.'\" M. omits the Latin\r\nphrase and reads in its place \"and I have only learned that they are\r\nalmost incomprehensible.\" D. reads as M. and then adds \"and therefore\r\nI shall only say,\" followed by the Latin phrase.\r\n\r\n[89] i.e., \"He himself knew our formation.\" The last word of the\r\nLatin phrase is omitted in M.\r\n\r\n[90] D. reads \"excuse myself from the burden and difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n[91] i.e., \"It is difficult to know man--a changeable and variable\r\nanimal.\" M. gives only the first four words of this Latin phrase.\r\n\r\n[92] i.e., \"I see men as trees walking.\"\r\n\r\n[93] Not set off into lines in the Ayer MS. A literal translation\r\nof the citation, which is rather freely translated in the text,\r\nis: \"Spring makes me green; burning summer, yellow; autumn, white;\r\nand chill winter, bald.\" M. omits all the quotation after the first\r\nthree words; D. reads \"Glaucumque\" instead of \"flavamque.\" The poet\r\nmentioned by San Agustin was a Welshman by the name of John Owen,\r\nor, according to his Latin name, Joannis Audoenus. He was born about\r\n1560, at Armon, Wales, and died in London, in 1622. He studied law at\r\nOxford, and afterward became a teacher at various places. He imitated\r\nthe Epigrams of Martial, and his Epigrammata were published first\r\nin three books at London, in 1606, but were later augmented by seven\r\nmore books. They were reprinted many times in various countries and\r\neven translated into other languages--among the latter, into English,\r\nFrench, and Spanish (Madrid, 1674-82). One of the best editions is\r\nthat printed at Paris in 1774.\r\n\r\n[94] D. omits this last phrase.\r\n\r\n[95] M. omits the epigram. It is the forty-seventh epigram of the\r\ntwelfth book, and is translated thus in Henry G. Bohn's Epigrams\r\nof Martial (London, 1877): \"You are at once morose and agreeable,\r\npleasing and repulsive. I can neither live with you nor without\r\nyou.\" It has been several times translated into English verse.\r\n\r\n[96] i.e., \"As many opinions as persons.\"\r\n\r\n[97] From the Greek words monos, \"one,\" \"single,\" and pas, \"all;\"\r\nthus meaning, \"homogeneous.\"\r\n\r\n[98] The Monophysites held that there was but one nature in\r\nChrist. They were condemned at the fourth general council held at\r\nChalcedon in 451, but the decision of that council was a few years\r\nlater set aside by an imperial encyclical issued by the emperor\r\nBasilicus. During the next century the Monophysites split up into\r\nmany sects, and fought among themselves. The Monophysites still\r\nexist in Armenia, Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia; and are represented\r\nby the Armenian National church, the Jacobite Christians of Syria\r\nand Mesopotamia, the Coptic church, and the Abyssinian church. The\r\nschismatic Christians of St. Thomas are now connected with the\r\nJacobites. See Addis and Arnold's Catholic Dictionary, pp. 597, 598.\r\n\r\n[99] M. greatly abridges this paragraph, among other things omitting\r\nall mention of the Monophysites. D. also omits the latter.\r\n\r\n[100] At this point M. adds \"who are the true Indians, so named from\r\nthe River Indus or from Indostan, for our Indians are so by catachresis\r\nor misusage.\"\r\n\r\n[101] The title of the Franciscan Juan de Torquemada's book, is\r\nas follows: Ia (-IIIa) Parte de los veynte y un libros rituales y\r\nmonarchia Indiana con el origen y guerras de los Indios occidentales\r\nde sus poblaçones, descubrimiento, conquista, conversion y otras\r\ncosas maravillosas de la misma tierra (Sevilla, 1615; in three parts).\r\n\r\n[102] The title of Antonio de Ramesal's book is Historia general de\r\nlas Indias Ocidentales, y particular, de la governacion de Chiapa,\r\ny Guatemala.

He was sent\r\nto Central America in 1613, and on his return wrote his book. See\r\nMoreri's Dictionaire, vii, p. 68; and Hoefer's Nouvelle biographie\r\ngénérale, xli, col. 956.\r\n\r\n[103] See Vol. VIII, p. 38, note 1.\r\n\r\n[104] Bartolome (not Bernardino) de las Casas, the great apostle of the\r\nIndians. He first went to the New World in 1502 as a planter, became a\r\nDominican religious in 1510, and in 1514 began to preach against the\r\ncruelty inflicted on the Indians by the Spaniards, for the purpose\r\nof alleviating their misfortunes, making numerous trips to Spain. He\r\nfinally obtained from Cárlos I the \"New Laws,\" which were so rigorous\r\nthat an attempt to enforce them resulted in an insurrection in Peru\r\nunder Gonzalo Pizarro, for an account of which see Pedro Gutiérrez\r\nde Santa Clara's Historia de las guerras civiles del Peru, 1544-1548\r\n(Madrid, 1904-05). He finally returned to Spain for the last time,\r\nand died after a few years in the Dominican convent of Valladolid. His\r\nwritings are many, and important. The reference in the text may be\r\nto his Brevissima relacion de la destruycion de las Indias (Sevilla,\r\n1552); or to his Historia general de las Indias, which existed only\r\nin MS., until 1875.\r\n\r\n[105] See Vol. XXIX, p. 189, note 42. San Agustin probably refers to\r\nhis Virtudes del Indio (1650?). Palafox left many writings, a number\r\nof which are of a controversial nature.\r\n\r\n[106] In D., \"taught.\"\r\n\r\n[107] In D., \"collect.\"\r\n\r\n[108] M. and D. call these last two peoples the \"Mogores\" and the\r\n\"Camarines.\"\r\n\r\n[109] Baltasar Gracian was born in Calatayud, Aragon, in 1601,\r\nand entered the Society of Jesus in 1619. He taught belles-lettres,\r\nphilosophy, moral theology, and the Holy Scriptures, and preached for\r\nseveral years. He was rector of the college at Taragona, Catalonia,\r\nwhere he died December 6, 1658. His first book, El Heroë, appeared in\r\n1630. The most famous of his numerous works was his Criticon, which\r\nis probably the book referred to in the text. It is a sort of satire\r\non the vices and customs of the times; and in places reminds one of\r\nPilgrim's Progress. It was published in three parts, the first in 1650\r\nat Madrid, and the other two at Huesca, in 1653. Most of his works were\r\npublished under his brother Lorenzo's name. His talent in writing is\r\nvitiated by his affectation and other faults. See Ticknor's History\r\nof Spanish Literature (New York, 1854); Sommervogel's Bibliothèque;\r\nMoreri's Dictionaire, iv, p. 174; and Hoefer's Nouvelle biographie\r\ngénérale, xxi, cols. 570, 571.\r\n\r\n[110] M. and D. add \"For most of the defects and vices of these\r\nIndians are common, on account of the,\" and continue as above.\r\n\r\n[111] This passage is badly confused in the three copies. The\r\ntranscriber of M. has wrongly made the viviendo acephalos of the Ayer\r\ncopy, bebiendo à sed [i.e., drinking when thirsty?] which hardly makes\r\nsense. That MS. continues, \"and in confused anarchy,\" which is better\r\nthan the Ayer reading. D. reads \"Who besides having been living as\r\nthe greatest barbarians, leaderless, and in confused anarchy.\"\r\n\r\n[112] Both M. and D. omit the passage referring to the influence and\r\ndominion of the moon. M. gives the names as \"Beyerlinhe,\" and D. as\r\n\"Bayarlinch.\"\r\n\r\nLaurentius Beyerlinck was a noted Flemish savant and litterateur. He\r\nwas born at Antwerp in 1578, and, after studying in that city with\r\nthe Jesuits, went to Louvain, where he enjoyed a benefice until\r\n1605. In that year he was recalled to Antwerp to become head of\r\nthe seminary, and soon afterward obtained a canonry and then an\r\narchdeaconry there. His death occurred in Antwerp June 22, 1627,\r\nat the age of forty-nine. Notwithstanding his short life and his\r\nreligious labors, he wrote a surprising amount. An edition of his\r\nMagnum Theatrum Vitæ Humanæ appeared in London, in eight volumes,\r\nin 1678. See Moreri's Dictionaire.\r\n\r\n[113] \"When they grow delirious in their sickness, they are never\r\nfrantic, but calm.\" (Mas, p. 64.)\r\n\r\n[114] M. and D. add here \"slow.\"\r\n\r\n[115] In the Ayer MS. \"serithnophagos.\" D. makes it \"ictiófagos,\"\r\nwhich reading we have adopted; and M. omits the phrase.\r\n\r\n[116] The abundance of fish is one of the means by which nature\r\naids their necessities. In the rainy season, all the creeks and\r\nravines are full of water and fish. The very rice fields swarm with\r\neels, shrimps, and a species of fish called dalag, which is about\r\ntwo palmos long and more than two inches thick. It is especially\r\ninteresting for an European to see a crowd of people in the month of\r\nOctober on the high-road, busily fishing in the sowed fields. As the\r\nrice is now grown, it is impossible to see the water that bathes and\r\nwets its roots, and consequently, when the hooks are drawn out with\r\nfish two palmos long on them, it appears to be enchantment, or the\r\ninconsequential things of a dream. As the water dries up, the fish,\r\nstill living, gather down in toward the hollows where there is yet some\r\nwater; and they are there caught with the hand, or killed with clubs.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians have three meals [per day]: breakfast, dinner, and\r\nsupper. These three meals consist of rice boiled in water but dry\r\nlike the rice cooked in the Valencian style, or like the Turkish\r\npilao. In addition they eat a trifle of fresh or salt fish, some\r\nsort of meat stew, camotes, etc.; but rarely do they have more than\r\ntwo different dishes, unless it is the occasion of a banquet. In the\r\ndearest provinces, the [expense of] common food cannot be estimated\r\nat more than one-half real of silver per day per adult; and since\r\nthe daily wage that they earn is at least one-half real and their\r\nfood, it results that this race have great opportunity to save and\r\nacquire considerable wealth. But their vices, their few necessities,\r\nand their disposition, which is indifferent and lacking in foresight,\r\ndoes not allow them to better the condition of their birth; and they\r\nremain in the wake of the mestizos, who are always the wealthy people\r\nof the villages.\" (Mas, pp. 64, 65.)\r\n\r\n[117] Mas says (p. 65): \"It is not easy for anyone to explain them,\r\nso long as he tries to consider these men equal to the Europeans.\"\r\n\r\n[118] This sentence is omitted in M. and D.\r\n\r\n[119] All the matter above between the word \"father\" and this point\r\nis lacking in M.\r\n\r\n[120] The solidus was a coin of the Roman empire, which was at first\r\ncalled \"aureus,\" and worth about twenty-five denarii, but afterward\r\nreduced to about one-half that value. It is used in the same manner as\r\n\"farthing\" or \"cent\" would be in English.\r\n\r\n[121] These passages are translated as follows in the Douay version\r\nof the Bible:\r\n\r\n4. Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found, and have\r\ngiven trouble to them that helped them.\r\n\r\n5. Till they receive, they kiss the hands of the lender, and in\r\npromise they humble their voice.\r\n\r\n6. But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will return\r\ntedious and murmuring words, and will complain of the time:\r\n\r\n7. And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will scarce pay\r\none-half, and will count it as if he had found it:\r\n\r\n8. But if not, he will defraud him of his money, and he shall get\r\nhim for an enemy without cause:\r\n\r\n9. And he will pay him with reproaches and curses, and instead of\r\nhonour and good turn will repay him injuries.\r\n\r\n[122] i.e., \"Scarce does he return the half.\"\r\n\r\n[123] In the Douay version: \"The sinner shall borrow and not pay\r\nagain;\" being only one-half the verse. M. omits the reference, but\r\ngives the passage.\r\n\r\n[124] Delgado (Historia, p. 306) commenting on this passage says: \"I\r\nfind noted many actions of the Indian boys who serve in the houses and\r\nconvents; and all are ridiculous things which we ourselves did in our\r\nown country when we were boys like them.\" He objects to San Agustin's\r\nquotation from Scripture on the ground that it is too general, and\r\nthat those words were not written merely for them. \"If twenty cases\r\nhave been experienced where the Indian borrower has failed to return\r\nwhat he borrowed, it cannot be said that the entire Tagálog nation are\r\nsinners, let alone other nations, which may not have been seen. Such\r\na supposition is illogical.\"\r\n\r\n[125] The paragraph structure of M. and D. differs from our text in\r\nthe above two paragraphs, and in other places throughout this letter;\r\nand the paragraphs are also unnumbered in both of these versions. The\r\ncopy owned by Eduardo Navarro, O.S.A., Valladolid, agrees with the\r\nAyer MS. in having numbered paragraphs, but the numbering is not in\r\nall cases the same.\r\n\r\n[126] At this point the following paragraphs which are not contained\r\nin either the Ayer MS. or in D. occur.\r\n\r\n\"They think that it is a fine thing to meddle and take part in things\r\nwhere they are not invited. Consequently, if any of Ours wishes to\r\nattend to any bodily necessity, not fit to mention, even when he least\r\nwishes it, there comes an Indian before or behind him even though he\r\nleave the banca and seek the most retired spot to do what no other\r\ncan do for him.\r\n\r\n\"They cruelly treat the animals that serve them, and the danger of\r\nlosing them does not move them to the contrary. Thus following the\r\nvery opposite of St. Paul's command: Non alligavis vos bobi trituranti\r\n[i.e., \"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,\"--I\r\nTim. v, 18, a quotation from Deut. xxv, 4], they tie the poor cow or\r\ncarabao to a post after it has worked all day; and, if it is a horse,\r\nthey feed it without removing bit or bridle. And if they have to look\r\nafter their carabao it must be on condition of their being atop of it\r\nwhile it moves from place to place; and on the road they make sores\r\non its buttocks.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Indian does not shut a door that he has opened, etc.;\r\nDelgado says (p. 306): \"This is done by boys, and is common in our\r\nown country. It is not because of laziness, but perchance, for lack\r\nof attention, or the liveliness or mischievousness of boys, in which\r\nthe aged and prudent Indians cannot be included.\" He has often seen\r\nthe carpenters carefully collect their tools and take them away, so\r\nthat they should not be lost. San Agustin's criticism is too general\r\nand has proceeded from what he has experienced in a few foolish lads.\r\n\r\n[127] \"This,\" says Delgado (p. 307) \"is peculiar only to some workmen,\r\nand not to all the nations of these islands, and the same thing\r\nhappens also in our own country among cobblers, tailors, and other\r\ndeceitful and tricky workmen.\"\r\n\r\nMas comments as follows (pp. 66, 67): \"There is no tailor, cobbler,\r\nor workman of any kind, who does not begin by begging money when any\r\nwork is ordered. If he is a carpenter, he needs the money in order\r\nto buy lumber; if a laundryman, to buy soap. This is not for lack of\r\nconfidence in receiving their pay, for the same thing happens with\r\nthose who have the best credit, with the cura of the village, and even\r\nwith the captain-general himself. It consists, firstly, in the fact\r\nthat the majority have no money, because of their dissipation; and\r\nsecondly, because they are sure that after they have received a part\r\nof their price, their customer will not go to another house, and that\r\nhe will wait for the workman as long as he wishes (which is usually\r\nas long as what he has collected lasts), and that then the customer\r\nwill have to take the work in the way in which it is delivered to him.\"\r\n\r\n[128] M. reads, \"in the region of the genitals;\" and D., \"ears.\"\r\n\r\n[129] Delgado says of this: \"Let us give thanks to God that our\r\nparents reared us in civilized ways; for if they had not, we would\r\ndo the same. But how many blows and lashes we had to take to become\r\nso! And indeed it must be noted that it is not so much because of\r\nrudeness that the Indian scratches himself, or does other things\r\nsomewhat more indecent and coarse, as has happened to me at times\r\nwhen with them; but because of a sort of fear or respect, that so\r\nconfuses them that they do not know at times what they are doing, or\r\neven what they are saying.\" The criticism, like others of San Agustin,\r\nis too sweeping. Delgado has not noticed this among the Visayans,\r\nalthough he has noted it among the Tagálogs. Because some women are\r\ncoarse, coarseness cannot be charged in general upon all the women\r\nof the islands.\r\n\r\n[130] D. reads \"And as yet they have not gotten over the difficulty\r\nof folding a cloak with the right side in.\"\r\n\r\n[131] M. and D. read \"make gestures of wonder.\"\r\n\r\n[132] \"I have observed that they are very stupid in making anything\r\nwhen one tries to give them instructions, but not when one allows them\r\nto work in their own manner. For example, one desires to have the cork\r\nwhich has slipped down into a bottle drawn. The best thing to say then,\r\nis 'See here, get this cork out without breaking the bottle. Take\r\ncare!' Thereupon the Indian goes and fixes it as well as he can. Once\r\nI asked an old woman for some fire to light my cigar. There were many\r\nlive coals on the ground remaining from a fire. She took a handful of\r\nearth in her palm, and atop of that placed a coal which she presented\r\nto me. In this way they do things that at times show sufficient\r\ningenuity and skill, especially with bamboo and rattan. General Alava\r\ndeclared that their brains were in their hands.\" (Mas, pp. 67, 68.)\r\n\r\n[133] These last six words are lacking in M. This refers to the\r\nwell-known myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. By Auresteo, San Agustin means\r\nAristæus, probably an early Greek poet, but deified as a beneficent\r\ngod and worshiped in various parts of Greece and other places. He\r\nwas said to be the son of Apollo and the Thessalian nymph Cyrene,\r\nand was reared by Hermes, who made him immortal; although he is also\r\nsometimes called the son of Urana and Gæa. His connection with the\r\nOrpheus myth was probably an innovation of Virgil (Georgics, iv,\r\nll. 315-558) who tells how he caused the death of Eurydice, who was\r\nkilled by a serpent while fleeing from his persecutions. See Smith's\r\nDictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, and Seyffert's\r\nDictionary of Classical Antiquities (London, 1891).\r\n\r\n\"It is still the custom in many of the churches for the men to take\r\ntheir positions in the center toward the upper part, and the women\r\nin the lower half.\" (Mas, p. 68.)\r\n\r\n[134] The last two words are missing in M. and D.\r\n\r\nCuriosity, says Delgado (p. 307) and impertinence is a characteristic\r\nof all the peoples of Asia.\r\n\r\n\"They have asked me often as to my employment or occupation, my manner\r\nof living, and the amount of my pay. This proceeds from the tolerance\r\nand benevolence that they generally find in The Spaniards.\" (Mas,\r\np. 68.)\r\n\r\n[135] This argues only their wildness and lack of civilization, says\r\nDelgado (pp. 307, 308), and they ought to be taught civilized manners\r\nby their masters, or at least by the missionaries. The Spanish houses\r\ngenerally have porters, so that the Indians cannot penetrate into the\r\nmost retired apartment. It may happen at times in Manila, or in some\r\nof the missions; but it is not the custom in the Visayas, or in the\r\nprovince of Tagálos. Delgado has never had such a thing happen to him,\r\nfor the Indians have always announced their arrival before entering.\r\n\r\n[136] \"This proves the severity with which they are treated by their\r\nown people, and the kindness that they experience in us.\" (Mas, p. 68.)\r\n\r\n[137] \"Thank God,\" says Delgado (p. 308) \"that I find the prognosis\r\nabove that says 'they are great sleepers' absolutely false.\"\r\n\r\n[138] This sentence is lacking in M. and D.\r\n\r\n[139] In D., \"where the women go.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do this because they are humored like children in the\r\nconvents.\" (Mas, p. 69.)\r\n\r\n[140] M. and D. omit \"and perukes.\"\r\n\r\n[141] Literally, \"the flower of the saints,\" perhaps alluding to\r\nsome book of lives of saints, thus entitled. M. has \"the isles of\r\nthe saints.\"\r\n\r\n[142] M. and D. omit the last three words.\r\n\r\n[143] \"Nearly all the villages have theaters for cock-fighting. Before\r\nfighting, some very sharp knives are fastened to the spurs so that\r\none or the other is killed at the first meeting. On this account the\r\ncockfight does not offer the interest or sport that it does in España\r\nand other places, and it occupies the attention of these people solely\r\nas a means of winning or losing money. In reality, a cockpit is a house\r\nof play. Before the two fowls are placed in attitude of fight, the bets\r\nare placed on two spindles. One of them generally offers a great sum in\r\nfavor of the black cock, while others bet on the white one, until the\r\nsum is matched. The leading cocks are loosed and one of them is killed\r\nin less than two minutes. This is in fact a 'monte,' as is playing\r\nthe races or betting on the jack [at cards]. The Filipinos, by nature\r\nidlers and greedy, are passionately fond of play, for they consider\r\nit an excellent and unique way of getting money without working; and\r\nthey gather like flies to these pernicious places, in order to spend\r\nwhat they have and what they can succeed in borrowing or robbing,\r\nabandoning their most sacred and peremptory obligations. Furthermore,\r\nthey pass many hours, both in their houses and in the cockpit, teaching\r\na cock how to fight and to have no fear of the people; and examining\r\nthe other cocks, in order to ascertain by certain rules and marks which\r\nwill triumph and which will succumb. There is nothing more commonly\r\nseen even in the very streets of Manila itself, than a man squatted\r\ndown on his heels with one of these fowls, in order that it might\r\nbecome accustomed to the noise, so that it might not grow confused or\r\nbecome frightened in the pit. There are men who take heed of nothing\r\nelse or have other thought during the day than of their cocks.\r\n\r\n\"The government authorizes these wretched gatherings, not only on\r\nSundays, but also on Thursdays or fair-days, which are not few,\r\nand has rented out the right of opening these theaters. Last year\r\nthis department produced about 40,000 pesos fuertes. A sad recourse\r\nwhich must have occasioned and will occasion so many tears, crimes,\r\nand punishments, since so much vagabondage is thereby caused. There\r\nare often serious quarrels, which two judges of the theater end\r\nby deciding according to the laws. When any one of the contestants\r\ndoes not conform to the sentence, he has recourse to the alcalde,\r\nwho takes the evidences in regard to the matter; and these quarrels\r\ngenerally go on appeal to the superintendency and to the upper\r\nlitigious assembly. These causes are judged according to existing\r\ninstructions, which were written in America.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians are also very fond of cards. They play brisca, burro\r\n(which is distinct from that of España), and panguingui, which is\r\na game played very commonly by the Chinese. In this occupation they\r\noften pass all the night until dawn; and the cabezas de barangay lose\r\nthe tributes of their subjects, and they have to go immediately to\r\njail, or take to the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"They generally play duplo at their parties--a game consisting in\r\narithmetical combinations--and also our game of forfeits.\" (Mas,\r\npp. 69-71.)\r\n\r\n[144] Delgado (p. 308) admits that the youthful servants do break\r\ndishes, but they are cheap. \"There are Indians in Manila who make\r\nand repair watches and other delicate baubles, and do not break\r\nthem. Consequently, not only can they handle bamboo, rattan, nipa, and\r\nbolos, but also other things; and they make and handle them lovingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is because they are generally heedless, sometimes through\r\nstupidity, and at other times because they are thinking of their\r\nsweetheart, or of something else, instead of what they are doing. When\r\nthe Filipino drops a dish, the Spaniard says nothing, or is satisfied\r\nby calling him only a brute, animal, or savage; while in his own home,\r\nhe would not escape without some buffets, which have more effect on\r\nthis race than would the Philippics of Cicero.\" (Mas, p. 71.)\r\n\r\n[145] \"The father must have said this of the country people, or of\r\nthose who are servants; for among those who devote themselves to the\r\narts there are some who turn out work very delicate and difficult to\r\nexecute, even in Europa--as, for instance, the textiles and embroidery\r\nof piña, and the gold chains or bejuquillos, etc.\" (Mas, pp. 71, 72.)\r\n\r\n[146] D. adds \"or [rather] not eating.\" This incident is related in\r\nthe second part of Don Quixote, chapter xlvii.\r\n\r\n[147] This sentence is omitted in M. The following is there a question,\r\n\"And what shall we say if they bring four eggs?\"\r\n\r\n[148] A Dominican and the assistant of Archbishop Pardo, who became\r\nacting archbishop after the death of the latter. See Ferrando's\r\nHistoria de los PP. Dominicos, vi, p. cxlvii; and our Vol. XXXIX,\r\n\"The Pardo Controversy.\"\r\n\r\n[149] Don Fernando Valenzuela, a grandee of Spain, marquis of San\r\nBartolomé de los Pinales and of Villasierra, chief master of the horse,\r\ngentleman of the chamber, etc., the favorite of the mother of Carlos\r\nII of Spain, Mariana of Austria (with whom his connection was said to\r\nbe dishonorable), was, as a youth, page to the Duke of Infantado. He\r\nwent to Rome with the duke, who was appointed ambassador to the papal\r\ncourt. On his return he gained the favor of the queen's confessor\r\nthe German Jesuit Nitard, who introduced him into court circles. His\r\nrise to favor was rapid, for he was talented and handsome. After the\r\ndownfall of Nitard, he gained entire ascendancy over the weak queen,\r\nwho showered honors upon him. Finally he was exiled to the Philippines\r\n(1670), through the efforts of Don Juan of Austria, uncle of the king,\r\nand was imprisoned in the fort of Cavite where he landed March 29,\r\n1679. On the death of Don Juan, the first act of the queen was to\r\nhave Valenzuela freed from his exile, and a special ship was sent\r\nto the Philippines to take him to Spain. It is reported, however,\r\nthat he died in Mexico, while on his way to Spain, from the kick of\r\na horse. He built the bridge over the Manzanares at Toledo, at the\r\ncost of one million ducats. See Harrison's History of Spain (Boston,\r\n1881); Montero y Vidal, i, p. 364; and Concepción, Hist. de Philipinas,\r\nvii, pp. 349-364. A document in Ventura del Arco's MS. collection\r\n(vol. iii)--which is a compilation from original documents in the Real\r\nAcademia de la Historia, Madrid--gives an account of the reception\r\naccorded to Valenzuela on his arrival at the Philippines, and some\r\ndetails of his life there.\r\n\r\n[150] M. reads \"rice in the husk.\"\r\n\r\n[151] M. and D. add \"pesos.\"\r\n\r\n[152] Delgado says (p. 308): \"If they had as much understanding as the\r\nreverend father, they would not do it.\" The cases cited prove nothing\r\ngeneral, since they are only particular cases. \"But it must be borne\r\nin mind that all the Indians of these islands are very poor, and dress\r\nvery poorly and live meanly; and when they see that the Spaniards,\r\nand especially these bishops and marquises, bear themselves with so\r\ngreat ostentation, and are so free and magnanimous and liberal, as\r\ntheir nobility demands, some Indians of little capacity are emboldened\r\nto beg from them things that they ought not; for they think that such\r\nmen will never remain poor even though they give much.\" We beg God\r\noften for things out of season.\r\n\r\n\"This is because they know beforehand that they ask nonsense, and\r\nassume that their demand will not be granted, but they only are trying\r\nto see whether it might be met by any chance; for they are accustomed\r\nto the extreme goodness of the Spaniards, and do not fear making them\r\nangry by an absurd demand.\" (Mas, pp. 72, 73.)\r\n\r\n[153] M. and D. read: \"Although the Sangleys cheat them, as if they\r\nwere simpletons, and they are satisfied to be cheated by them.\"\r\n\r\nDelgado says (p. 309): \"This I absolutely deny, for I have more than\r\nonce seen that after the Indians have traversed the whole Parian of\r\nthe Sangleys to sell their goods, if they are not offered more than\r\nfour they immediately carry their goods to the Spaniards or to the\r\nfathers, in order to get eight for them; and this must be tongod\r\nsa calooy, that is, for charity, which the Spaniard and the father\r\nalways practice with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a fact, but it needs explanation. The Filipino is by nature\r\nphlegmatic, and especially when it is a question of buying or selling\r\nanything; for he exerts himself to get the largest profit possible,\r\nand the calculation of that costs him much trouble. A countryman\r\ncomes, for instance, to sell two or three quintals of indigo to a\r\nmerchant. Thereupon, he does not come alone, but is accompanied\r\nby relatives and friends, and sometimes women. Very often the\r\nindigo belongs to four or five owners, who all come in the wake of\r\nthe seller. Each proposition must be communicated to the society\r\nthat is squatted there in a circle on their heels. The matter is\r\ndiscussed at length, and then it is decided to lower the price one\r\npeso per quintal. The buyer claims that the price should be three\r\npesos. Finally this point is settled. Then another discussion begins,\r\nnamely, that the indigo is damp, and that some pounds must be allowed\r\nfor waste. In short the transaction is so tiresome and so eternal,\r\nthat there are very few Spaniards who have the patience to endure so\r\nmuch impertinence and importunity; and they generally end by saying\r\ndryly, 'Will you or will you not give it?' And then they order them\r\nangrily into the street. The Chinese and mestizos do not hurry them,\r\nbut on the contrary invite them to eat, and keep them in their houses\r\nfor three or four hours, and sometimes days. Finally they get the goods\r\nfor what they wish to give, and more often cheat them like Chinese. For\r\nthe Filipino is very stupid even in matters of self-interest. Once\r\nI was with a Spaniard who was buying indigo. After the trading had\r\ncost him more patience than Job must have had, the indigo was weighed\r\nbefore him, the account was reckoned, the money made ready and placed\r\non the table in piles of 20 pesos, while there was one of 7, which\r\nwas placed separately, and another of reals and copper coins. The\r\nman who had been most attentive to everything took the piles of 20's\r\nand left the pile of 7. We called him back to tell him to take that\r\nmoney which he had left. Thereupon he took the seven pesos, and it\r\nwas necessary to call him back the third time to tell him that all\r\nthe money on the table belonged to him. He himself had determined\r\nthat the price should be 52 or 53 per quintal, and then he took what\r\nwas given him. The majority are the same. Then it is learned that\r\na Chinese has bought for 20 the same quantity of indigo for which a\r\nSpaniard offered 25. It is said that a Filipino would rather receive\r\none real from a Chinese than one peso from a Spaniard, as we have\r\njust seen was written by Father Gaspar.\" (Mas, pp. 73, 74.)\r\n\r\n[154] \"And tell me, your Paternity,\" says Delgado (p. 309), \"who is\r\nnot given to this vice in this land?\"--an interesting commentary on\r\nsocial conditions.\r\n\r\n[155] Commenting on this, Delgado (p. 309) says: \"Who are the ones who\r\ncut the timber, and build the ships, galleys, and galliots, as says\r\nFather Murillo, and work in the ships in the port? Then they do this\r\nstretched out in their houses, as says our father master? It is true\r\nthat they are always poor, but the true cause of that is different. Let\r\nthem not admit into Manila so many heathen Chinese, who possess in\r\nthemselves all the trades and employments, by which one may seek\r\nhis livelihood. The Indians would apply themselves to these trades,\r\nand would not lie stretched out in their houses, for the Sangleys do\r\nnot allow them to engage in these or to seek their livelihood.\"\r\n\r\nMas says (pp. 75-77): \"I have never read a single manuscript or\r\nprinted book about the Filipinos that does not speak of their laziness.\r\n\r\n\"I, accustomed to hear the term 'lazy' given to Spaniards, and to\r\nother men who have been or are idle--rather through the influence\r\nof bad laws or because of the lack of laws, than because of the\r\nimpulses of their physical organization--was ready to believe that\r\nthe Filipinos would be found to exhibit the same characteristic in\r\nregard to this--especially when I remembered the system of delivering\r\nthe provinces to trading governors and monopolists and the prohibition\r\nfor so many years of trading with foreign ports, which still exists,\r\nwith the exception of the city of Manila. But in spite of the fact\r\nthat these things powerfully influence the obstruction of the founts\r\nof wealth and choke incentives to work, I have seen things that have\r\nmade me change my opinion. For instance, I have desired to send people\r\nto get grass for my horses; and, in spite of the facts that it was\r\nvery abundant and near, and there was not the slightest doubt about\r\nthe pay, I have been unable to get anyone to go for it. On arriving\r\nat a village, I have endeavored to get a guide to accompany me to the\r\nnext village; and, in spite of the facts that the distance was not\r\nmore than one hour and the road excellent, I have found it difficult\r\nto obtain him. And even I have obtained it by means of the justice, as\r\n[a carrier of] baggage; although one pays for this service, according\r\nto the schedule, one silver real, with which a Filipino has enough to\r\nlive on for at least two days. A few weeks before my departure from\r\nFilipinas I was at an estate belonging to religious, where there are\r\nvarious individuals who enjoy an annual salary sufficient to support\r\nthemselves, on condition that they guard the estate against robbers,\r\nand that they work whenever necessary, in which case their day's wage\r\nis paid them. The question was raised of transferring the rice in the\r\nhusk from one granary to another, distant about 20 paces, and they\r\nwere not to work more than the hours usual in that country, which\r\nare very few, for which they were to be given one silver real daily,\r\nbesides their food. All this was in addition to their annual pay. It\r\nis to be noted that the season was the dryest and coolest of the whole\r\nyear, namely, the month of January, and a Filipino's support cost then\r\nabout five cuartos per diem. However, by no means would they consent\r\nto work consecutively all the days, for they said that when night came\r\nthey were exhausted, and needed rest on the following day. Had I not\r\nbeen present there I would not have believed it. I have been in many\r\nFilipino huts where I saw many men and women pass the day without doing\r\nanything, while everything was indicative of their poverty. I have\r\nexamined the condition of the fields, and I have discovered that any\r\nman may become wealthy, and yet all live in wretchedness. I have been\r\nmuch surprised to hear that they must be ordered by edict to sow the\r\nfields, so that the propitious season may not pass by; and that those\r\nwho allow their houses to burn are punished. Especially have I noted\r\nthat the Chinese mestizos, who are partly of the same blood as the most\r\ndiligent Chinese immigrants, are always comfortable, and some of them\r\nhave accumulated considerable wealth. This might all be in the hands\r\nof the Filipinos, who are the most ancient inhabitants, have enjoyed\r\nand enjoy greater protection, and have been owners of all the estates\r\nthat are now possessed by the mestizos, which the latter have bought\r\nby the fruits of their industry and their economy. It is to be noted\r\nthat all the Chinese who come to Filipinas are very poor, and come\r\nfrom a colder country. Gentil says that the Filipinos have acquired\r\ntheir laziness from the Spaniards; but if they have learned indolence\r\nfrom the Spaniards, why did not the mestizos learn it also, who are on\r\nthe contrary so active and industrious? Why have they not learned to\r\nbe diligent from the mestizos, since they have a more continual and\r\nintimate intercourse with them than with the Spaniards? I conclude\r\nby saying that after examining and weighing everything thoroughly,\r\nI am of the opinion that there exists in the nature of the Filipino,\r\nquite independent of any accessory and modifying cause, an element\r\nof quiet and inertia that is but slightly neutralized by the ambition\r\nof acquiring consideration and wealth.\"\r\n\r\n[156] Delgado (pp. 309-310) says: \"This happens perhaps among the\r\nboys who serve in the convents in Tagalos and in no other missions;\r\nand I have also seen them awakened in another manner. And although\r\nthis seems a matter for laughter among us Spaniards, it is not so\r\nfor them. For they do it in order not to make the other impatient by\r\nwaking him suddenly, and it serves among them as a kind of prudence\r\nand respect. The game thing happens when they call at the door of\r\nany house. But generally they enter without the formulas of etiquette.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a hard fact and has been called to my attention often. For\r\nin any other matter whatsoever, it is well understood that ignorance\r\nmakes an unpolished man appear quite distinct from a civilized\r\nman. But when it comes to waking one who is sleeping, I cannot\r\nconceive that wisdom, or even a knowledge of reading, can have the\r\nleast influence. But I believe that I have discovered the origin of\r\nthis peculiarity. The remontados Filipinos of Abra have the greatest\r\nrespect for a sleeping man. Their deepest curse is 'May I die when\r\nasleep.' Their oath, when they come to the province of Ilocos for the\r\nelection of gobernadorcillos, for causes, etc., is 'May I die when\r\nasleep,' 'May a bolt of lightning strike me,' etc. This same fear of\r\ndying when asleep exists also in other tribes and in the provinces of\r\nIlocos, and must have been formerly a general idea, since, as we have\r\nalready observed, the origin of our Christianized Indians and those\r\nat present remontados and called infidels was the same. Whether this\r\nfear arose from some disease in which the people slept and did not\r\nawaken, or whether only from the similitude of sleep to death, it is\r\ndifficult to ascertain. However, it is always surprising that, since\r\nno one now dies or becomes sick because his rest is interrupted, the\r\nIndians still constantly preserve this so stupid dread; so that even\r\nafter a master has ordered his servant to awaken him, the latter has\r\ngreat difficulty in doing it in a quick and positive manner, although\r\nhe knows that, if he do not execute it, it will put his master out\r\ngreatly. That shows at least the most powerful influence of habit\r\non the minds of these men. Somewhat similar to this is our custom\r\nof saying 'Jesus,' when anyone sneezes--a custom which I have heard\r\nexpressed by 'God bless you,' 'Á vous souhaits,' 'Salute,' etc.,\r\namong all the peoples of Europa.... This custom generally allows\r\nthe man who receives an accident to die without aid, because of not\r\nawaking the physician or cura.\" (Mas, pp. 77, 78.)\r\n\r\n[157] This is because the Indians do not appreciate the danger,\r\nsays Delgado (p. 310). This happens often on narrow roads, and not\r\nto Indians, but to Spaniards or mulattoes, and neither will yield to\r\nthe other, whereupon quarrels ensue. But the lesser always yields to\r\nthe greater. It has happened once or twice to Delgado.\r\n\r\n\"This is a fact, and a proof of their indifference and\r\nstolidity.\" (Mas, p. 78.)\r\n\r\n[158] The lengua franca is the trade-jargon of the Orient. The\r\noriginal of the passage above is as follows: \"Deó grande nopillar\r\nfantacia; mondo cosi cosi; si estar escrito in testa andar andar;\r\nsino acá morir.\" M. reads \"an andar andar,\" and has other slight\r\ndifferences. D. reads \"ha (de) andar\" and has also other slight\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nThe full name of the author above mentioned is Gabriel Gomez de\r\nLosada, and his book is Escuela de trabaios, in quatro libros dividida:\r\nPrimero, del cautiverio mas cruel.... Segundo, Noticias y govierno de\r\nArgel: Tercero, necessidad y conveniencia de la redempcion de Cautivos\r\nChristianos: Quarto, el mejor cautivo rescatado.... (Madrid, 1670).\r\n\r\n[159] M. and D. add (though with a slight difference in wording)\r\n\"for they will not believe that he who loves danger will perish in it.\"\r\n\r\nSome Indians are fatalists, but not all, says Delgado (p. 310). The\r\nVisayans are generally careful, and watch out for the crocodiles. Those\r\nwho have been devoured by those reptiles have always been evil, and\r\nwere so punished by God for their sins. Mas says (p. 79), that this\r\nfatalism must have been imported from Asia.\r\n\r\n[160] Delgado says (p. 310): \"This proceeds from their barbarous\r\ncondition, and because the Spaniards commonly deceive them, and\r\nteach them things that are not very good, especially the convict\r\nguachinangos, of whom this country is full. But that they cannot\r\nbe persuaded that it is a sin to steal from the religious or from\r\nthe Spaniards, I regard as a misapprehension, or at least it is not\r\ncommon for this to happen, although his Paternity brings forward such\r\nevidence, that one cannot doubt him. For I have seen the contrary in\r\nmany villages.\"\r\n\r\nMas (pp. 80, 81), says: \"It is a fact that some Indians have but\r\nlittle scruple in stealing from Spaniards, for they say that all\r\nthat the latter possess is of the Philippines and consequently\r\ntheirs. But do not believe that they have any consideration for their\r\nfellow-countrymen. In its proper place we shall see that theft is\r\nthe greatest part of the criminality of the islands.... It is to be\r\nnoted that they generally rob on a small and rarely on a large scale;\r\nfor their ambition is limited to satisfying a vice or to bettering\r\ntheir present condition, but not in changing it.\r\n\r\n\"The father provincial of the Augustinian religious, said in his\r\nprinted report, in the compilation made concerning the causes of the\r\ninsurrection in Ilocos in 1807:\r\n\r\n\"'The Indians of Ilocos have become highwaymen, like those of the\r\nother provinces. They steal cows, horses, and carabaos from their own\r\ncountrymen; and those who are occupied in this trade are ready for\r\nall sorts of evil. It is not surprising that many of these should\r\nhave come with the deserters who first rebelled in the mountains\r\nof Piddig, and that others should unite with them when the fire\r\nwas fanned. But one can not call this a cause for insurrection,\r\nnor do I believe that for such thefts the means should be to take\r\nthe stealers of carabaos to Manila so that they might be punished;\r\nbut it is enough for the alcaldes-mayor to watch over their province\r\nand punish these thefts. By so doing they would succeed in lessening\r\nthefts, for the extermination of them is as impossible as is making\r\nan end of the classes of the thieves according to the proverb of the\r\nIndians, \"When the rats die, then the thieves will come to an end.\"'\r\n\r\n\"It is true that perhaps one ought not to ascribe all this\r\ndemoralization to a perverse disposition. One must not have lived\r\namong the Filipinos, or have been very blind in regard to them, to\r\nsay that they are all thieves. There are very many who, although they\r\ncould steal with impunity, do not do so.... The frequency of theft may\r\nproceed from other causes. Perhaps the system of mercy and impunity\r\nthat has dictated and is dictating the sentences of the Audiencia of\r\nManila has contributed thereto....\"\r\n\r\n[161] M. and D. omit \"of which I heard,\" and the latter reads \"and\r\nI shall only tell of two of which I was a witness.\"\r\n\r\nSpaniards also, says Delgado (pp. 310, 311), recount things that are\r\nnot credible, and \"it is not to be wondered at that some rude and\r\nignorant people should believe such nonsense; and if they believe\r\nsome things that are told them by some scholars, it is because of\r\nthe authority of those people among them.... This happens commonly\r\nin other places, besides among the Indians.\"\r\n\r\n[162] See an account of this matter and the trouble caused by it,\r\nin Vol. XXXIX.\r\n\r\n[163] i.e., \"Silver and gold have I none\"--a reference to Acts III, 6.\r\n\r\n[164] M. and D. read \"miners.\"\r\n\r\n[165] \"When the ship 'Santa Ana' arrived at Manila in the year 1832\r\nwith 250 Spanish soldiers, it was rumored among the women of the\r\ntobacco factory that those soldiers were coming to take away their\r\nchildren in order to irrigate the mines in España with their blood. All\r\nwere aroused and fled to their homes, took their children, and began\r\nto take refuge in the houses of the Spanish women, and they could\r\nnot be persuaded that it was all nonsense. The house of Doña Dolores\r\nGoyena was filled with them. Also many men armed with spears came\r\nout on the streets; but the disorder gradually subsided.\" (Mas, p. 82.)\r\n\r\n[166] M. and D. add \"for all the ministers cannot free them from\r\nthis deceit.\"\r\n\r\n[167] This is not so in general, says Delgado (p. 311), but is true\r\nonly of some individuals among the various nations.\r\n\r\n[168] M. reads \"respect the Spaniard more.\"\r\n\r\n[169] The truth is that any Spaniard, with rare exceptions, has more\r\npenetration, more vivacity, more nobility, more talent, and more\r\ncourage than a Filipino. This superiority can do no less than have\r\nits effect.... For the rest, few in Manila have an exact idea of the\r\nFilipino character. Their arrogance may be seen in the importance\r\nwhich the gobernadorcillos give to themselves. They go daily to\r\nthe city hall, but they make two regidors go to their houses to get\r\nthem. There the regidors wait until the gobernadorcillo is ready to\r\ncome out, and the latter then goes in solemn state to the city hall,\r\npreceded by the regidors and the alguacils, with staffs in hand. When\r\nthese officers reach the door of the city hall, they stop in order to\r\nallow the gobernadorcillo to pass between them; and he enters without\r\nnoticing the salutes given him by the guards, who take off their hats\r\nto him. He immediately takes a seat which is on an elevated platform,\r\nand there he thinks himself to be on a throne; and even the Spaniards\r\nwho enter casually, especially in the villages on the highroad,\r\nappear of but little importance to him. This is the place where\r\nthe auditors of the Audiencia of Manila, and all others who have\r\nany share in the government of Filipinas, ought to come incognito,\r\nand as if in passing, in order to know the Filipinos--instead of\r\nforming an opinion of their character from the servants of their\r\nhouse, or from those who go to the capital with clasped hands and a\r\ndowncast look in their eyes to ask some favor of them. The strange\r\nthing is, that the Indians do not learn from the alcaldes-mayor,\r\nwho administer justice with the greatest equality, and who do not\r\nsit in an elevated place, or even sit down, and go into the street\r\nwithout any following. This aristocratic spirit may be observed in\r\nthe church. All the principales, who consist of the gobernadorcillos,\r\ncabezas de barangay, and all others who have the title 'Don' and\r\nwear a jacket, seat themselves in the central aisle or nave; and the\r\nfollowing order of etiquette is in general scrupulously observed: the\r\ngobernadorcillo; the ex-gobernadorcillos, who are called past captains,\r\nin order of their seniority; the actual first lieutenant, who must be\r\na cabeza de barangay; the two lieutenants; and nine present officials;\r\nthe ex-cabezas, in order of seniority. If any ex-captain from another\r\nvillage is present, he takes a seat among those of his class, and\r\nis given the first place, out of courtesy. When the lieutenants and\r\nofficials leave their posts, they are not called principales, as are\r\nthe others, but titulados.\" (Mas, pp. 83, 84.)\r\n\r\n[170] D. reads \"petty sextons.\"\r\n\r\n[171] Delgado says (p. 311): \"It is a fact that nature always inclines\r\nrather to evil than to good. But in order to correct their vices\r\nthere are fervent and zealous ministers in all parts, who preach to\r\nand teach them.\"\r\n\r\nMas says (pp. 85-89): \"In fact some Indians practice ceremonies in\r\ntheir marriages which date from before the conquest.\r\n\r\n\"On the birth of an infant, the newborn child is sometimes taken to\r\nanother house in order to free it from the Patianac; and, when the\r\nchild is taken out for baptism, aromatic substances and incense are\r\nburned for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\"When a person dies, they celebrate a novena in his house at night,\r\nwhere the relatives (and sometimes those who are not relatives)\r\nassemble. After praying, it is not seldom that they sit down to\r\ngamble. On the last day there is a great banquet, and sometimes a\r\ndance. These mortuary feasts are practiced even yet, in all their\r\npurity, in the mountains, as we have already seen.\r\n\r\n\"If possible, both men and women bathe daily in the river. The women\r\nenter the water wrapped in their tapices, taking care that the bosom is\r\ncovered. When they are in the water they take that garment off to wash\r\nthemselves. The men enter the water with wide pantaloons and the body\r\nbare. They enter the river at any hour and before everybody; but one\r\nmust confess that they do it with great decency and modesty.... When I\r\nwas in Santa Cruz de la Laguna, the cura published an edict ordering\r\nmen and women not to bathe in the same place. That gave rise to\r\nmany jokes and jests, and it is to be supposed that they continued\r\ntheir old-time customs. They consider us as not overcleanly, because\r\nthey see us make less use than they of the bath.... It is also the\r\ncustom for the families of the country and many Europeans to bathe\r\ntogether. During the outdoor sports of Manila, at the summer houses\r\nof Mariquina, or other neighboring towns, the chief diversion is the\r\nbath. The women generally enter the water wearing a kind of blouse,\r\nand the men with wide pantaloons and the body uncovered. Newcomers\r\nfrom Europa do not consider this amusement at all decent.\r\n\r\n\"They kiss by bringing the nostril near and drawing in the breath. This\r\nis the plain kiss in the mountains, but some Filipinos of the plains,\r\nespecially of Manila, have also become accustomed to kiss with the\r\nlips; but they always put the nose to the face at the same time,\r\nand if they have a sincere affection, they always smell as if they\r\nwere giving a deep sigh with their mouth closed.... When they look\r\nat a person from a distance, and desire to express their desire to\r\nkiss him, they constrict the nose in the manner of one smelling. A\r\nvery extreme kind of kiss is given by rubbing the nose on the spot\r\nthat they wish to feel, and drawing in the breath as long as possible.\r\n\r\n\"I am greatly surprised that no one of the writers on the Filipinos\r\nhas spoken of this remarkable fact, which springs from their exquisite\r\nsense of smell. It is so great that a servant can tell his master's\r\nshirt, after it is cleaned and ironed, even though it lies with ten\r\nor twelve other shirts resembling it and belonging to other persons,\r\nby simply smelling them. They also assert that if a man be near a woman\r\nfor whom he experiences a feeling of love, she knows it by the odor of\r\nhis perspiration, and vice versa. As a pledge of affection, they ask\r\nfor a shirt that has been worn--which they return after it has lost\r\nits odor, and replace by another, just as we beg for a lock of hair.\r\n\r\n\"They had the custom of circumcision, a custom which they did not\r\nacquire from the Arabs, since it is still practiced on the peaks of\r\nthe independent mountains. They practice it still, and that against the\r\nwill of the curas. Ancient customs have very great force. It is to be\r\nnoted that the manner of operation is not the same as that practiced\r\nby the Jews, for the cut is made from the upper to the lower part.\r\n\r\n\"They had the custom that the suitor for a maiden's hand went to serve\r\nin the house of his future father-in-law for three or four years, and\r\ndid whatever he was asked--in general, the most onerous duties. Then\r\nthe parents of the bride had to give him a house, clothes, etc., and\r\nthe marriage was celebrated. In many provinces, as for instance, in\r\nBulacan, there is now no trace of this custom, because of the abuses\r\nwhich were committed. This custom, which we meet in the first pages of\r\nthe Old Testament, could not have been acquired from the Mussulmans,\r\nwho by their Koran hold laws diametrically opposed. This custom is\r\nstill followed in Laguna, although the young man does not live in the\r\nhouse of his loved one, for the cura does not permit it. The friars\r\nhave done their utmost to destroy this custom.\r\n\r\n\"They scarify new-born infants in order to draw blood from them;\r\nand then apply lighted matches to various parts of the body, which\r\ncause them burns, and serve the place of caustics.\r\n\r\n\"Women in childbirth they suspend by the hair in order to stop the\r\nflow; and, after parturition, they compress the abdomen, and press\r\ndown with great force on both thighs at once, in order to make the\r\norgans return to their former position; and they perform other things\r\nof like nature, which we consider as injurious and nonsensical. But\r\nthey hold one of their old women higher than the best Paris physician.\r\n\r\n\"They consider the balete tree as sacred. At marriage, they carry it\r\ndishes of food as an offering; and it is very difficult, or impossible,\r\nto make them cut one of them. It has happened that they have begged\r\nincense from the cura on various pretexts in order to go immediately\r\nand burn it under a balete tree.\r\n\r\n\"They are very fond of telling tales of love adventures, of witches,\r\nand enchantment, and everything else that is rare and marvelous,\r\neven though it be nonsense and against common sense.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that all diseases are cured by drawing out the air that\r\nhas been introduced into the body; and, consequently, their favorite\r\nremedy is to supply a kind of cupping-glass of Chinese origin, which\r\nthey drag over two palmos on any part of the body, and which leaves\r\na great red streak.\r\n\r\n\"They respect their fathers and mothers greatly, and even the younger\r\nbrothers the older. I have seen a married woman, on entering her house,\r\nkiss the hand of a sister older than herself.\r\n\r\n\"In order that a young man may marry, he must give the bride the money\r\nor other things up to her value; and that price is often kept by the\r\nparents. The parents would rather have their daughter remain single,\r\neven though she be with child, than to give her without a dowry. It\r\nis not seldom that one can hear a mother say that she will not give\r\nher daughter for less than one hundred pesos, or fifty, etc.\r\n\r\n\"In order to strike fire they take a bit of bamboo, and slit it down\r\nthe middle lengthwise. In the hollow or inner part, they dig out one\r\nportion near the center, which leaves the bamboo much thinner. Then on\r\nthe outside they open a chink, lengthwise. Then they take the knife,\r\nand scraping the upper part of the other half-bamboo, they make some\r\nvery fine shavings. These they roll about between the two palms\r\nof the hands until they form a small ball, and that they place in\r\nthe hollow of the half-bamboo. The latter they place on the ground,\r\nwith the shavings below. Then with the other half bamboo, they rub\r\n(while singing) across the one which has the shavings below it, upon\r\nthe same point where the shavings are placed, and in a few seconds\r\nthey begin to smoke. Thereupon they rub faster and blow, and a blaze\r\nstarts. All this is the work of one minute.\r\n\r\n\"On going out between people, or when passing in front of anyone,\r\nthey bend the body and clasp the hands, which they then move forward\r\nas if they wished to open a path or cut the air. This is a sign of\r\nrespect, or their method of asking leave to pass.\r\n\r\n\"The women ride horseback, not astride, but with a side-saddle,\r\nas do Europeans.\"\r\n\r\n[172] M. reads \"most of them.\"\r\n\r\n[173] This is common throughout the world, says Delgado (p. 311). \"That\r\nthey do not know their age happens commonly among rude and wild\r\npeople, wherever they may be; but their age is known very well by\r\ntheir datos and chiefs, in order to assign them their place in the\r\ntribute readily. In what pertains to their ancient beliefs, there is\r\nno doubt that these are preserved in some parts, and there is no lack\r\nof babailanes, who are their priestesses or diuateras; but one must\r\nconsider that all these peoples of the Indias are new Christians,\r\nand the seed that the enemy had sown, and which had thrust so deep\r\nroots into them, has not yet been completely destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n[174] M. and D. omit \"than the word of the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nMas says (pp. 90-96): \"The superstitions of these people can be\r\ndivided into three classes. The first consists in believing that\r\ncertain monsters or ghosts exist, to which they give names and assign\r\nspecial duties, and even certain exterior forms, which are described\r\nby those who affirm that they have seen them. Such are the Tigbalan,\r\nOsuang, Patianac, Sava, Naanayo, Tavac, Nono, Mancuculan, Aiasip,\r\nthe rock Mutya, etc.\r\n\r\n\"The Antinganting is any object which promises wealth or happiness,\r\nas we would speak of the girdle of Venus, or the ring of Giges.\r\n\r\n\"Many Spaniards, especially the curas, imagine that these beliefs are\r\nnot very deeply rooted, or that they have declined, and that most of\r\nthe Filipinos are free from them. This is because in the presence\r\nof such the Filipinos do not dare tell the truth, not even in the\r\nconfessional, because of their fear of the reprimand that surely awaits\r\nthem. I have talked to many about these things, some of whom at the\r\nbeginning began to laugh, and to joke about the poor fools who put\r\nfaith in such nonsense. But when they saw that I was treating the\r\nmatter seriously, and with the spirit of inquiry as a real thing,\r\nthey changed their tone, and made no difficulty in assuring me of\r\nthe existence of the fabulous beings described above....\r\n\r\n\"The second class consists in various practices, like that of burning\r\nincense under the balete tree; putting ashes at the door of the house\r\nwhere a person has died, in order that they might recognize the tracks\r\nof the soul of the dead one; leaving a plate for the dead man at the\r\ntable, etc.\r\n\r\n\"When Don G. Piñeiro went to Culamba in 1841, for the purpose of\r\nclimbing a lofty mountain, he encountered innumerable difficulties\r\nin getting people to accompany him, in spite of the orders of the\r\nsuperior government; and he had to desist and climb from the village\r\nof Los Baños accompanied by the cura, who had the road opened for\r\nhim. The reason for that, as the said religious assured me, was the\r\nfear of the Filipinos for the anito, although the excuses that they\r\noffered were quite different.\r\n\r\n\"In the said village of Los Baños, they believe that there is an\r\nantinganting in one of the hot water springs, which has water at 67°\r\nReaumur. This consists in the Divine Child, who appears and hops\r\nabout in the water on Good Friday; and he who catches Him obtains\r\nthe antinganting. This last year, 1841, a man tried to get too near,\r\nand fell in. His entire body was scalded, and he was bled; but not\r\none drop of blood could be drawn from his body, and he died on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\n\"The third, and to me the most remarkable, class is found not in\r\ncertain personages or superstitious and determined proceedings, but\r\nin sudden and capricious scenes, and in improbable and inexplainable\r\napparitions.\r\n\r\n\"There is scarce a Filipino, even the most enlightened, who does not\r\ntell marvelous things that have happened to him--wondrous visions,\r\nmute and speechless; ghosts, goblins, strange figures; dead people;\r\ndogs, and fabulous and never imagined animals; castles, and balls of\r\nfire, that have appeared to him; frightful noises of all sorts that\r\nhave scared him; and, finally, the most improbable stories and bits\r\nof nonsense that could be invented by the most raving maniac.\r\n\r\n\"On hearing them recount so many of these extravagances, and seeing\r\nthat they distinguish them from dreams, I have been unable to believe\r\nthat they were deceits; and observing their faces very carefully\r\nduring the narration, I have been convinced that they were intimately\r\npersuaded that they had seen the things that they described. Whence\r\ncan this mental weakness come? It is not from ignorance, for I have\r\nnoticed the same thing as in the others, in several clerics who have\r\nstudied in the university for ten or twelve years. One day I was in\r\na convent where the boards of the floor began to creak because of\r\ndryness, and the coadjutor became so frightened that he went away\r\nto sleep in another house; and the Christian reflections, jests,\r\nand anger of the Spanish cura could not restrain him.... The Filipino\r\ncura, Don J. Severiano Mallares, committed and caused to be committed\r\nfifty-seven assassinations, because he believed that he could by\r\nthis means save his mother, who, he had persuaded himself, had been\r\nbewitched; and was hanged in the year 1840. The attorney on that cause\r\ntalked in pathetic terms of the indescribable and barbarous prodigality\r\nof blood shed by that monster. Reflecting upon this phenomenon, I am\r\ninclined to think that it is based on their natural timorousness....\"\r\n\r\n[175] In D., \"indolent.\"\r\n\r\n[176] From the word \"islands\" to this point, is omitted in D.\r\n\r\n[177] \"That they are tyrants, one over the other,\" says Delgado\r\n(p. 311), \"I do not deny. They inherited this peculiarity from their\r\nancestors, and it has as yet been impossible to uproot it entirely,\r\nas many others which they learned from their ancestors. However, these\r\nvices are not so common as they were formerly. And not only would the\r\nIndians of these islands have been consumed if the Spaniards had not\r\ncome hither, but they would have been conquered and enslaved by the\r\nneighboring nations, such as the Borneans, Chinese, and Japanese,\r\nas we see in the books of history.\r\n\r\n\" ... The principales were the aim of the popular wrath in the Ilocan\r\ninsurrection in 1807. 'Kill all the lords and ladies' was the cry,\r\nwhile the people hastened toward the capital to petition for the\r\nabolition of the monopolies and the fifths. The same thing happened\r\nin the year 1814.\" (Mas, p. 97.)\r\n\r\n[178] M. omits \"and bring it back as cold as ice.\"\r\n\r\n[179] This is a general statement that is not true, says Delgado\r\n(pp. 311, 312), for the example given is merely from boys; and,\r\nbesides, it never freezes in Filipinas.\r\n\r\n[180] This citation is missing in M. It is from Horace's Satires,\r\nbook i, ll, 106, 107. E. C. Wickham (Horace for English Readers;\r\nOxford, 1903, p. 163), translates the passage as follows: \"There is\r\nmeasure in everything. There are fixed limits beyond which and short\r\nof which right cannot find resting-place.\"\r\n\r\n[181] \"That they need beatings and the rattan,\" says Delgado (p. 312),\r\n\"as examples prove, is a fact, and they confess it; but they resemble\r\nall other nations in this particular.... But it must be employed\r\nwith prudence and moderation, as the discipline is employed by our\r\nfathers in our own lands, regarding them as sons and small children,\r\nand not as slaves or as our enemies. For God has brought us to their\r\nlands, in order to watch over them, and maintains us here for love\r\nof them. We must note that the Indians are not so bad as they seem\r\nto us.... It must also be observed that there are many Spaniards, and\r\neven ministers, who are melancholy and crabbed, and so ill-conditioned\r\nand moody, that everything wounds them, and they are contented with\r\nnothing. All the actions of the Indians displease them, and they even\r\nbelieve that the Indians do them purposely to make them impatient\r\nand to jest with them. From such ill-conditioned people the Indians\r\nsuffer much, and tolerate and endure much, because of their respect\r\nfor them. Consequently what the reverend father says below, namely\r\n'that it costs them more to be Christians than one would believe'\r\nis a fact and true.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards cry out and are in despair at seeing the continual\r\nand great acts of rudeness of the Filipinos, some of which are\r\ndone maliciously, with the sole object of making us angry, when\r\nthey contract hate for us. At times after they have wearied and\r\ndisgusted the Spaniards grievously, and have caused the latter to\r\ngive them a buffet, this is a cause for great sport among them,\r\nand they celebrate it in the kitchen amid great guffaws, as I have\r\nheard many times. Especially is it so if those who are made angry\r\nare women. But the Spaniards persist in not being convinced of this\r\nfact, nor will they ever learn how to treat this people. The old men\r\nof the country say that the Spaniard is fire and the Filipino snow,\r\nand that the snow consumes the fire.\" (Mas, pp. 97, 98.)\r\n\r\n[182] M. and D. add \"His master chid him, but the lad replied that\r\nthe hen had but one leg.\"\r\n\r\n[183] This quotation is lacking in M. and D.\r\n\r\n[184] M. and D. read \"in love and esteem.\"\r\n\r\n[185] \"I shall not at present enter upon a discussion of whether\r\none ought or ought not beat the Filipino. I shall only remark, as\r\na matter pertaining to this section, that the first thing that one\r\nsees in any of their houses is the rattan hanging in a corner. When\r\na father places his son in any Spanish house, this is his charge:\r\n'Sir, beat him often.' To educate the young people, or to establish\r\norder in any place without the use of the rattan, is a thing that\r\nthey do not understand.\" (Mas, p. 99.)\r\n\r\nIt is said that even at the present day a Filipino father will not\r\nhesitate to chastise his son corporally, even after the latter has\r\nattained his majority.\r\n\r\n[186] This last phrase and the Latin quotation are lacking in\r\nM. Englished that quotation is, \"The evil hate sin for fear of\r\npunishment.\"\r\n\r\n[187] This phrase is omitted in D.\r\n\r\n[188] In D. this is \"even if it be a leaf.\"\r\n\r\n[189] Delgado says (p. 312): \"But if his Paternity knows of this\r\nlack, how surprising that this and other things happen in regard\r\nto them, such as that all keep their faces turned toward him who\r\nconfesses. If his Paternity would then preach them a sermon and\r\ncorrect them, I assure him that they would correct themselves, and\r\nthese backward-looking dancers who are so immodest in the church, when\r\nthey ought to be modestly thinking of their sins and repenting of them,\r\nwould correct themselves, and would not cause wonder and laughter.\"\r\n\r\n[190] M. omits the remainder of this sentence. For \"Januses,\" D. reads\r\n\"worms.\"\r\n\r\n[191] Because some of the Indians are given to blasphemy, says Delgado\r\n(p. 313), it does not follow that all of them are blasphemous.\r\n\r\n[192] \"I shall here attempt a delicate and interesting investigation,\r\nnamely, the religiousness of the Filipinos. There are opposite\r\nopinions on this matter, and serious errors are liable to arise....\r\n\"The women always wear scapulars about the neck, and usually some\r\nsort of a small cross; and a reliquary, containing the bones of a\r\nsaint and a bit of the wood of the cross. But this has become a part\r\nof the dress, like earrings or necklaces, and both the devout women\r\nand those who are not devout wear them.\r\n\r\n\"The walls of the houses are often covered with the engravings of\r\nsaints, and on the tables are many glass globes and urns containing\r\nsaints, virgins, and little figures of the Divine Child, which\r\ngenerally have the face as well as the hands of ivory, and silver\r\nclothes richly embroidered. In well-to-do houses there are so many\r\nthat they resemble a storehouse of saints rather than a habitation. In\r\nmany houses this is a matter of vanity and ostentation; and they\r\nregard valuable saints as they do bureaus and mirrors elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"In the church great sedateness and devotion or silence reigns. In\r\nthe villages the church is divided into three parts. In one end the\r\nwomen are seated, in the other the men, while the gobernadorcillos\r\nand principales occupy the center. However, this is not observed very\r\nstrictly in some villages. In some churches there are men in the front\r\nhalf and women in the back half. When a small village is founded,\r\nin order to get the concession for a settlement and for a cura they\r\noffer to give the latter, in addition to paying the sanctórum tribute\r\n[a tribute paid to the Church by all Philippine natives of sixteen\r\nyears and over], a monthly quantity of rice, eggs, fowls, etc.,\r\nbut they are afterward very remiss in living up to their offer. Many\r\nfriars have had to have recourse to the alcaldes and to the officials\r\nof the district; and I have even heard of one of them who had to take a\r\nmusket and kill the fowls in the yards, and carry them to the convent.\r\n\r\n\"They are very fond of singing the passion or history of the death of\r\nJesus Christ, which is written in Tagálog verse. During the evenings\r\nof Lent, the young men and women assemble in the houses for this\r\npurpose. But although this was a religious gathering at the time when\r\nit was originated, at the present time it has been converted into a\r\ncarnival amusement, or to speak more plainly, into a pretext for the\r\nmost scandalous vices; and the result of these canticles is that many\r\nof the girls of the village become enceinte. So true is what I have\r\njust said that the curas have prohibited everywhere the singing of the\r\npassion at night; and some of the curas go out with a whip in order to\r\ndisperse them--or rather, send the fiscal of the church to ascertain\r\nwho is singing, and send for such person immediately to beat him.\r\n\r\n\"They say that all the saints are Spanish, since the patrons of their\r\nchurches are always of this class. They would have no veneration for\r\na saint with a flat nose and the physiognomy of a Filipino.\r\n\r\n\"When any sick person refuses to confess, his relatives request\r\nhim to do so. In this case they do not tell him that he will be\r\ncondemned, etc., but, 'Consider what a shame it will be; just think\r\nwhat people will say; consider that you will be buried outside of\r\nholy ground.' The idea of being buried on the beach is what gives\r\nthem most fear. This can only be explained by saying that they have\r\nseen the cemetery and the beach and not hell, nor the other world,\r\nwhich, as one would believe, costs them much to conceive--although\r\nin reality they do believe in it, in the same way as many Europeans\r\nbelieve in it, but without understanding it, and only because the\r\nsages give assurance of it....\r\n\r\n\"In spite of this indifference regarding the future life, they\r\ngenerally order masses said for the souls of their ancestors, and\r\nnot because of compromise or vanity, but true faith and devotion,\r\nalthough this does not argue much in favor of their religiousness. For\r\nthe Igorots, who are the type of the Filipinos, although they do not\r\nbelieve in the immortality of the soul, have many superstitions in\r\nregard to the shades of the dead....\r\n\r\n\"In some places the curas have to lock the doors of the church after\r\nmass, so that the people will not depart without hearing the sermon,\r\nand this in places quite religious, as is Pangasinan. Many of those who\r\nare carried to Mindanao or to Jolo as captives become renegades with\r\nthe greatest ease; and then they will not return, even though they may.\r\n\r\n\"Some make the sign of the cross as they go down the stairways. All\r\nstop on the street at the sound of the prayer-bell; and the same\r\nthing happens in the houses, where they often pray on their knees\r\nwith true devotion. They all remove their hats when passing in front\r\nof the church, and many stop to pray. Nevertheless, all the curas\r\nassert that they make a false confession, for they only confess the\r\nthree following sins: absence from mass, eating of meat during Lent,\r\nand vain blaspheming; although it is apparent to the curas that they\r\nhave committed other greater sins. It is a great trouble to get them\r\nto take part in the procession, and those who can do so escape through\r\nthe cross streets. In Manila it is necessary for the regimental heads\r\nto appoint soldiers to go to take part in this act, and to pay them\r\none-half real; and, were it not for this expedient, it would sometimes\r\nbe impossible to do it. The curas have considerable trouble in the\r\nvillages in getting them to confess. They are given forty days of\r\ngrace, and many come after being threatened with twenty-five lashes;\r\nwhile many of the degree of captain, and many who are not, get\r\nalong in spite of all without confession. In the village of Lilio,\r\non the brow of Mount Banahao, where there are 1,300 tributes, there\r\nwere more than 600 persons who did not confess in the year 1840; and\r\nthis has not been one of the most remiss villages in the fulfilment\r\nof its religious duties.\"\r\n\r\n[Father Juan Ferrando, who examined Mas's MS., says that 'the Filipinos\r\nconfess according to the instruction that is given them. In Manila,\r\nas I know by experience, they confess as well as the most fervent\r\nSpaniard, and I have heard many fathers say the same of many Indians\r\nof the provinces.']\r\n\r\n\"Very many of them also never go to mass in any village where the\r\ncura is not especially zealous. In the city of Vigan, where there are\r\nabout 30,000 persons, not more than 500 or 800 went to church during\r\nmy stay there on any feast-day, except one of especial devotion to\r\ncelebrate a virgin patroness of the city. There has been and is much\r\ntalk of the influence of the curas in the villages. No doubt there is\r\nsomething in it, but their respect and deference toward the parish\r\npriest is influenced not a little, in my opinion by their idea (and\r\none not ill founded) of the power of the priest, of the employment\r\nthat he can give; and of their hope that he will protect them in any\r\noppression that they receive from the civil government or from the\r\nsoldiers. In reality, the friar usually addresses his parishioners\r\nin the language of peace, which is the method which fits well into\r\nthe phlegmatic Filipino. He constitutes himself their defender, even\r\nwithout their having any regard for him--now from the injuries that\r\nthe avarice of their governors causes them, now from the tendency\r\nof these to acquire preponderance and to command, which is the\r\nfirst instinct of man. Consequently, the friars, by resisting and\r\nrestraining in all parts, and at so great a distance from Madrid,\r\nthe tyranny or greed of the Spaniards, have been very useful to the\r\nvillages, and have been acquiring their love. And since the islands\r\nare not kept subject by force, but by the will of the mass of the\r\ninhabitants, and the means of persuasion are principally in the\r\nhands of the religious, the government is necessarily obliged to\r\nshow the latter considerable deference. From this fact originates\r\ntheir influence in temporal affairs, and the fear mixed with the\r\nrespect with which they inspire the people. Three facts naturally\r\nresult from all this. The cura, speaking in general, is the one who\r\ngoverns the village. Consequently, when a new village is formed its\r\ninhabitants do not care to be annexed or dependent on another village\r\nin regard to spiritual things; but desire and petition for a parish\r\npriest of their own, in order that they might have in him a powerful\r\ndefender in their differences and suits with other settlements, or\r\nwith the alcalde of the province. Lastly, the ascendency that the\r\nminister is seen to enjoy is perhaps as much civil as religious,\r\nif it is not more so. And in fact ... although they have often\r\nsucceeded in pacifying seditions by their mere presence alone,\r\nand the insurgents, for instance, in Ilocos in the year 1807,\r\nsurrendered to the friar the cannon that they had captured from a\r\nband of 36 soldiers and two patrols of the guard, who were routed,\r\nyet at other times not only have individuals but whole masses refused\r\nto listen to the admonitions of the religious, have completely lost\r\nrespect for them, have insulted them, threatened them, wounded them,\r\nand even assassinated them, and have not lacked the complement of all\r\nthis, profaning the churches. I shall not mention the thefts in the\r\nchurches, such as one which happened in the capital of Pangasinan when\r\nI was there in that province; for these might be considered as single\r\nindividual deeds, isolated and insignificant. I deduce then, as the\r\nresultant conclusion of all these observations, that there are many\r\nFilipinos, especially among the feminine sex, who have the true fear\r\nof God, but many others who feel a great natural indifference in this\r\nmatter. They exhibit scarce a disposition toward religion, a fact that\r\nI believe must proceed from their little consideration of the wonders\r\nof religion ... which is a mark of their small amount of intelligence,\r\nfor they show great indifference for the punishments of the other\r\nworld, and even the ecclesiastical punishments of this. Nothing\r\nshows this so clearly as the insincere confessions which they make\r\nin order to finish with it. It is to be noted that almost the same\r\nthing happens at the hour of death, and that this is seen in the small\r\nand remote villages where Spaniards have never been. Neither can it\r\nbe the result of errors of faith or philosophic reading, since the\r\npeople know no other books than those of the doctrine or the passion.\r\n\r\n\"Combining the above data and observations with what I have heard\r\nrecounted, and what we see in manuscripts and printed books about\r\nthe method by which the old-time religious have maintained devotion\r\nin these islands--which has been by calling the list in order to\r\nascertain those who did not observe their obligation to attend mass\r\nand confession, and by punishing in the church courtyard those who\r\nare remiss--I am inclined to believe that the law of Jesus Christ is\r\nlearned here superficially; and that if the system adopted some years\r\nago be continued, of obliging the curas to reduce themselves only to\r\nthe means of preaching, prohibiting them rigorously from compulsive\r\nand positive means, before a century passes there will be but few\r\npure-blooded natives in this archipelago who are true and devout\r\nChristians....\" (Mas, pp. 100-106.)\r\n\r\n[193] M. and D. omit all of this last sentence and quotation.\r\n\r\n[194] A vice common to all the world, says Delgado (p. 313).\r\n\r\n[195] \"Although they have but little honor, they have in effect only\r\ntoo much vanity. When one goes to their houses, they make a great\r\neffort to show off their wealth, even if they have to beg a loan in\r\norder to meet the expense. They do not care to bury their relatives\r\nfor the love of God, although they try if possible to avoid the payment\r\nof the funeral expenses. A cura told me that after a man had paid him\r\nthe burial expenses a baguio or hurricane began; whereupon the man\r\ncame to get his money, saying that he wished the burial of a pauper,\r\nbecause in the end, no one would have to see it.\" (Mas, p. 107.)\r\n\r\n[196] Delgado (p. 313) utters a warning against judging on this\r\nparticular, and says \"that virtues are not so distant from them,\r\nas his Paternity writes.\"\r\n\r\n[197] M. omits this sentence to this point.\r\n\r\n[198] What fault do the Indians have in trying to get and defend\r\ntheir own? There may be excess in this matter, says Delgado (p. 313),\r\nbut the Indians do not go to law only to cause trouble.\r\n\r\n[199] M. and D. omit this sentence.\r\n\r\n[200] In regard to this Delgado says (pp. 313, 314) that \"there is no\r\ndish more relished in this land than defamation and complaint.... This\r\nis a country where idleness sits enthroned; for when the ship is\r\ndespatched to Nueva España there is nothing to do for a whole year,\r\nbut to complain and discuss the lives of others.\" Delgado does not\r\nbelieve that lust is the only feature in the intercourse between\r\nmen and women. Neither does he believe that women are treated,\r\nas they deserve, with kicks and blows; nor that such treatment is\r\nin accordance with conjugal love, or with the text of women being\r\nsubject to men. San Agustin's advice to Europeans is not good.\r\n\r\n[201] The Ayer MS. and M. read \"Machiabelo;\" D. reads \"Macabeo,\" i.e.,\r\n\"Maccabæan.\"\r\n\r\n[202] From this point M. and D. read: \"They call this mabibig, and\r\nthis is a thing that will rouse up the entire village against one,\r\nthe stones, and the land itself. Hence, the concubinages among them,\r\nand other evils, have no human remedy, nor can have; for no one\r\nwishes to be mabibig, for that is the most abominable fault and the\r\nonly sin among them.\"\r\n\r\n[203] The Indians do not tell tales of one another for a more potent\r\nreason than that of being declared mabibig, is Delgado's commentary\r\n(pp. 314, 315)--namely, the fear, of private revenge. \"But the prudent\r\nIndians always advise the father minister, if there is any scandal in\r\nthe village; now in confession, so that it might be remedied without\r\nanyone knowing the person who has told it; now by a fictitious and\r\nanonymous letter, as has happened to me several times. One must\r\nexercise prudence in this matter, for all that is written or spoken\r\nis not generally true.\"\r\n\r\n[204] M. and D. read with some slight verbal differences, which\r\ntranslate the same: \"For one might happen to have a servant or two who\r\nwaste and destroy the property of their master, and no other servant,\r\nhowever kindly he has been treated by his master, will tell him what\r\nis happening.\"\r\n\r\n[205] \"This league of the caste of color for mutual protection and\r\ndefense from the domineering caste is very natural. The Filipinos\r\nare not so constant in maintaining it, however, that it is not broken\r\nby two methods: by offering money to the accuser, or by bestowing so\r\nmany lashes on each one who is implicated in the crime.\" (Mas, p. 109.)\r\n\r\n[206] Delgado (p. 315) finds this very natural, and dismisses it by\r\nthe reflection that liberty is dear.\r\n\r\n[207] In M. and D. this reads: \"Therefore when they say that there\r\nis no more sugar or no more oil, it is when there is not [sugar]\r\nenough to make a cup of chocolate, or oil enough to whet a knife.\"\r\n\r\n[208] M. and D. read: \"They will place the best cup and plate,\r\n[D. mentions only the plate] which are much different than the others,\r\nfor the master, and will only look after him, and pay no attention\r\nto the guests.\"\r\n\r\n[209] M. and D. omit this sentence.\r\n\r\n[210] Spanish, sacabuches consistol y deresistol, a transcriber's\r\nerror for con sistol y diastol (this phrase omitted in D.); a play\r\non words, as the sackbut forms the various tones by lengthening and\r\nshortening the instrument. The phrase systole and diastole is now\r\napplied to the alternate contraction and expansion of the heart;\r\nSan Agustin apparently uses it through fondness for a learned phrase.\r\n\r\n[211] The citation from Quevedo is lacking in M. San Agustin has\r\nslightly misquoted; though it translates the same as the correct\r\nversion. The lines are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Galalon, que en casa come poco,\r\n    y á costa agena el corpanchon ahita.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe citation is from Quevedo's Poema heroica de las necedades y\r\nlocuras de Orlando el enamorado.\r\n\r\n[212] That is, \"Much good may it do you,\" an expression used at\r\neating or drinking. San Agustin evidently refers in the following\r\nclause to the scanty fare supplied to those who row in the boats as\r\ncompulsory service.\r\n\r\n[213] This is not a general rule among the Tagálogs, and much less\r\namong the Visayans. Neither are all the Indians forgers. (Delgado,\r\npp. 315, 316.)\r\n\r\n[214] M. omits \"alcalde\" and reads \"prudent and experienced\r\nman.\" D. reads \"a prudent and experienced alcalde.\"\r\n\r\n[215] i.e., \"I heard your evidence, and feared.\"\r\n\r\n[216] M. reads \"some Indians;\" D., \"some erudite Indians.\"\r\n\r\n[217] Rabula, \"an ignorant, vociferous lawyer;\" cf.

See IV Kings (II\r\nKings of the King James version), xxiii, 29, 30; and II Paralipomenon\r\n(II Chronicles of the King James version), xxxv, 22-25.\r\n\r\n[221] M. reads: \"the Indians making use of a whole year in order\r\nto increase their calumny.\" D. reads: \"Just see what subtlety and\r\nmoderate arithmetic they use in order to make their accusation;\r\nthe Indians lumping together a whole year in order to give pasture\r\nto one single horse;\" and then adds: \"And there are so many cases of\r\nthis that if I mentioned them all I would never end.\"\r\n\r\n[222] We have thus freely translated the original sin afianzar\r\ncalumnia, which is a regular law term.\r\n\r\n[223] \"But a short time ago, when Señor Seoane was regent of the\r\nAudiencia, as the result of an urgent complaint against a Spanish\r\ncura, a verbal process was ordered to be made, and from it not the\r\nslightest charge resulted against the priest. Another judge was\r\nentrusted with the forming of another verbal process, with the same\r\nresult. The supreme tribunal, being persuaded that the matter was\r\nnot all calumny, sent an expressly commissioned judge from Manila,\r\nwho found no more crime than did the others.\r\n\r\n\"I personally saw a representation signed by the gobernadorcillo and\r\nall the principales of a village, in which they affirmed that their\r\ncura had forced the wife of the first lieutenant; had punished the\r\nlieutenant for opposing her being kept to sleep in the convent; went\r\nout on the street drunk; went into the town hall to beat individuals\r\nof the municipality; and had not celebrated mass on Sunday for the\r\nsame reason of being drunk. When a verbal process was made of it,\r\nall retracted. I became acquainted personally with this friar, who\r\nis a fine fellow....\" (Mas, pp. 113, 114.)\r\n\r\n[224] From this point, M. and D. read: \"but it is to images of some\r\nnew miracle. They have the habit of devotion, but they seek the newest\r\nand forget the old.\"\r\n\r\n[225] As to the Indians being fond of making pilgrimages to new and\r\ndistant shrines where some notable miracle has occurred, Spaniards\r\noften have the same love. See Delgado, p. 316.\r\n\r\n[226] San Agustin is speaking of the Indians of Manila and its\r\nenvirons, says Delgado (p. 316): \"For this is rarely seen in the\r\nother islands. Hence in the twenty-four years that I have lived in\r\nthe Visayas, only in the city of Cebu have I ever seen any other\r\nthan some religious drama [auto sacramental], or the pieces of the\r\nschool children.\"\r\n\r\n[227] In M. escuitiles; and in D. miscuitiles.\r\n\r\n[228] The verse number is given correctly in M. San Agustin quotes\r\nincorrectly, the proper version being:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,\r\n    Quam quæ sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe translation given by Wickham (ut supra, p. 349), is as follows:\r\n\"What finds entrance through the ear stirs the mind less actively\r\nthan what is submitted to the eyes, which we cannot doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are very fond of seeing theatrical pieces. They make some\r\ntranslations from our dramas, and they make a piece out of anything\r\nalthough it is destitute of the rules of art. They are especially fond\r\nof very long comedies, that last a month or more, with many hours of\r\nrepresentation daily. These are drawn from histories or from stories,\r\nand they stage them. In Tondo there was played, for instance, Matilde,\r\nó las Cruzadas [i.e., \"Matilda, or the Crusades\"]. The Celestina\r\nwas probably the origin of this taste. Filipino poets have written\r\nseveral dramas of this kind, as well as some epic, religious, and\r\nlove poems. But in the epoch previous to the arrival of the Spaniards,\r\nit appears that there existed only a few love songs, of whose merits\r\nI cannot judge, as I know the language so slightly.\r\n\r\n\"They have verses of as many as twelve syllables, which are the ones\r\ngenerally used in their poems. They are divided into quatrains, whose\r\nfour verses rhyme among themselves. The Filipino rhyme, however,\r\nconsists in the last letter being a vowel or a consonant.... They\r\nread all their verses in a singing tone, and the quatrains of the\r\ntwelve-syllable verse are read with the motif of the comintan,\r\nwhich is their national song. The custom of singing when reading\r\npoetry is a practice of China, and of all the Asiatic peoples whom I\r\nhave visited. The kind of versification which I have just cited is\r\nevidently anterior to our conquest, as is also the above-mentioned\r\nair, which is adjusted to it. This air is melancholy and does not\r\nresemble at all any Chinese or Indian music that I have heard. There\r\nare several comintans, just as there are different boleros, Polish\r\ndances, or Tyrolian dances. Some of them have a great resemblance to\r\nthe music of Arabia. On the slopes of Camachin [which is a mountain\r\nin southern Mindanao], I heard a song which is exactly and purely of\r\nthat sort....\" (Mas, pp. 115, 116.)\r\n\r\nThe Celestina mentioned by Mas is a noted dramatic story--probably\r\nwritten about 1480, and by Rodrigo Cota, of Toledo, and others--which\r\nhas exercised a very strong influence on the Spanish national drama. It\r\nhas great literary merit, admirable style, and well-drawn pictures of\r\nhuman nature; and it attained so extensive and continual popularity\r\nthat even the Inquisition did not place Celestina in the Index until\r\n1793, notwithstanding its grossness of thought and language. (Ticknor,\r\nHistory of Spanish Literature, i, pp. 262-272.)\r\n\r\n[229] M. and D. read \"Christ our Lord.\"\r\n\r\n[230] \"In the Visayas,\" says Delgado (p. 317) \"very rarely do the\r\nIndians imitate the Spaniards in their dress; for almost all of them\r\ngo barefoot, according to their custom, and wear long black garments\r\nthat cover the entire body (which we call cassocks or lambong), very\r\nwide breeches, and the shirt outside. For they can never accustom\r\nthemselves, as do the Spaniards, to gathering it inside, as is the\r\ncustom of the country. I have seen the same among the Tagálogs, with\r\nthe exception of some servants of the Spaniards, and some officials\r\nand clerks, among them. But these men do not make the rule for the\r\nother nations of this archipelago, who are numerous and different. I\r\ncan truly tell what I see among the Spaniards of Visayas, who dress in\r\nthe same manner as the Indians; and very rarely do they put on shoes\r\nand stockings or slippers, except on an important feast-day when they\r\ngo to the church, for they cannot endure it any other way. It is a\r\nfact that the Indians do preserve somewhat their ancient customs in\r\ndistricts where there is less civilization and instruction; but where\r\nthey are well taught and directed, they have almost forgotten these.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cura told me that he had surprised a man and three old women\r\ncrouched down beside the corpse of the former's dead wife. The four\r\npeople were all covered over with sheets, and were in the attitude of\r\nlistening with the closest of attention to see whether the deceased\r\nwould say anything to them. They practice many simplicities like this\r\nin all their solemn ceremonies, of which we have spoken. So general is\r\nthis that in the ordinances of good government in force, there is an\r\narticle that orders the persecution of idolatry and aniterias.\" (Mas,\r\npp. 116, 117.)\r\n\r\n[231] \"If father Fray Gaspar had been in Madrid, he would not have been\r\nso greatly surprised that those soliciting anything should send their\r\nwives to obtain favors. Moreover, the Filipinos, not only fearing,\r\nbut with full consciousness, generally send and even take their wives\r\nto the Spaniards to obtain some employment, or merely for money. The\r\nmost direct means for a general to obtain the friendship of a married\r\nwoman is to win over the husband, just as in order to get a single\r\nwoman one must gain over the mother. I have known very intimately\r\na steward who was very much in love with his wife, and was jealous\r\neven of her shadow. Nevertheless, at the least insinuation of his\r\nmaster he took her to the latter's apartment, and it appears that he\r\ndesired her to go there very often. Upon thinking over this matter,\r\nI am convinced that a partial cause of it is the little importance\r\nthat they attach to the act of love, and especially in the fact to\r\nwhich they are persuaded that no one of their women will ever love\r\nus; and they are only handed over for the profit, and are lent us\r\nas a personal service, just like any other; and when the woman goes\r\naway from us, she takes her heart with her, which is all for the\r\nFilipinos.\" (Mas, p. 117.)\r\n\r\n[232] M. and D. add \"most.\"\r\n\r\n[233] This phrase is omitted in D.\r\n\r\n[234] It is not to be wondered at that they are literal and material\r\nin their conversation, for they know only their villages. See Delgado,\r\np. 317.\r\n\r\n\"I have observed none of this, especially in the women to whom I\r\nhave talked. Almost all of them are always attentive, courteous,\r\nand kind.\" (Mas, p. 118.)\r\n\r\n[235] M. and D. omit this sentence.\r\n\r\n[236] M. adds: \"and run away, for he is the bugaboo, with which the\r\nchildren are frightened.\"\r\n\r\n[237] Dogs do not bark at the Spaniards only, in any country, but\r\nat those who are strange to them. Neither do the Indians detest the\r\nfathers from birth. The fact that the Indians yield to anyone who\r\nassumes a boasting attitude, especially if he be drunk, and have a\r\nknife, is not so much cowardice as prudence. \"I believe that the\r\nreverend father was very melancholy, and tired of the ministry,\r\nwhen he began to write his letter.\" (Delgado, pp. 317, 318.)\r\n\r\n\"If our father had traveled, he would have known that dogs bark at\r\nanyone whose clothes are unfamiliar to them. In regard to their horror\r\nof white faces, he at least exaggerates. It is not at all strange\r\nthat a child should cry at an object being presented to him that he\r\nhas never had in his ken before. I have seen many children burst into\r\nsobs at the sight of my eye-glasses. It is a fact that some of them\r\nhave just as little as possible to do with us, either for contempt,\r\nembarrassment, or antipathy; but there are a very great number who\r\nprofess affection for us. When the government secretary, Cambronero,\r\ndied in the year 1840, all his servants shed tears abundantly. A\r\nserving-maid of the Señora de Recaño was left desolate, when the latter\r\nembarked for España a short time ago. An old woman on the occasion of\r\n[the engagement of] Movales in the year 1823, gave Col. Santa Romana\r\nproofs of great affection and fidelity. During the same engagement,\r\nwhile Don Domingo Benito was haranguing his artillery sergeants\r\nand telling them 'I shall die the first,' one of them answered,\r\n'No, Sir, I shall die before you.' When the Jesuits were exiled,\r\nthe villages that they administered grieved exceedingly. In the\r\narchives of St. Augustine, I have seen the relation of one of the\r\nfriars who went there for their relief, and he paints in lively colors\r\nthe memory preserved of the Jesuits: 'Here they cannot look upon a\r\nwhite habit; notwithstanding the kind words that we speak to them,\r\nand the presents that we make them, we cannot attract to ourselves\r\nthe good-will of these people; hence, when we call a child, he runs\r\naway instead of coming to us.' I have seen some servants ready and\r\nanxious to go with their master to any part of the world; and, if\r\nthe Spaniards would take than, many would go to España. When some\r\ninsurgents in the island of Leite put Alcalde Lara in the stocks,\r\nhis servant feigned to be in accord with them. He made them drunk,\r\nand then took his master from the stocks. He fitted up a barangay\r\nquickly, in which they attempted to escape, but the night was stormy,\r\nand all were drowned. And finally, I myself have received several\r\ndisinterested proofs of their good-will.\" (Mas, pp. 118, 119.)\r\n\r\n[238] \"It is difficult to ascertain whether the Filipino is a brave\r\nman or a coward. On one side, we see any braggart terrify a multitude;\r\nand on the other, some face dangers and death with unmoved spirit. When\r\none of them decides to kill another, he does it without thinking at\r\nall of the consequences. A man of Vigan killed a girl who did not love\r\nhim, six other persons, and a buffalo; and then stabbed at a tree,\r\nand killed himself. Another servant of the tobacco superintendent\r\nkilled a girl for the same reason, before a crowd of people, and\r\nthen himself. A soldier killed a girl for the same reason while I\r\nwas passing in front of Santo Thomás. A coachman, in November, 1841,\r\ntried to kill another man, because of a love affair; and, failing\r\nin the attempt, killed himself. Filipino sailors have committed many\r\ncruelties, and have a reputation throughout the entire Indian Sea as\r\nturbulent fellows and assassins. The [insurance] companies of Bengal\r\ndo not insure at full risk a vessel in which one-half the crew is\r\ncomposed of islanders. When I was in the island of Pinang, at the\r\nstrait of Malacca, I tried to get passage to Singapor, in order to\r\ngo to Filipinas, in the brigantine \"Juana\" and to take in my company\r\nas a servant one of the seventeen sailors of Manila, who had been\r\ndischarged from a Portuguese vessel because of a row that they had had\r\nwith the captain. The commander of the \"Juana\" was a Chinese, and the\r\ncrew Malayan; counting sailors and Chinese passengers there were about\r\n40 persons aboard. Under no consideration would the captain admit me\r\ntogether with the servant, telling me: 'No, no, even if you give me a\r\nhundred pesos, I will take no man from Manila.' In fact, after much\r\nbegging, I had to resign myself and leave him ashore, and take ship\r\nwithout knowing who would guide and serve me; for I understood neither\r\nChinese nor Malayan. At the same time, I have heard that the Filipinos\r\nare cowards in a storm. The infantry captain Molla told me that the\r\ncaptain of a pontín which encountered a heavy tempest began to weep,\r\nand the sailors hid in order not to work; and he had to drive them\r\nout of the corners with a stick, for which they began to mutiny and\r\nto try to pitch him overboard. Ashore they have given some proofs of\r\nboldness by attacking Spaniards to their faces.... Sergeant Mateo was\r\nboldly confronted in the insurrection of 1823. The soldiers have the\r\nexcellent quality of being obedient, and if they have Spanish officers\r\nand sergeants, will not turn their backs on the fire; but alone they\r\nhave never given proof of gallantry. In the war with the English, they\r\nalways fled ... and the few Europeans whom Anda had were his hope, and\r\nthe soul of all his operations. I have asked many officers who have\r\nfought with Filipinos, either against the savages in the mountains,\r\nor against ladrones; and they all have told me that when it comes to\r\nfighting, they preferred to have twenty-five Europeans to one hundred\r\nFilipinos. Many allege, in proof of their bravery, the indifference\r\nwith which they die; but this is rather a sign of stupidity than of\r\ngood courage. From all of the above data, we might deduce that the\r\nindividual whom we are analyzing is more often found to be cowardly\r\nthan impassive and fearless; but that he is apt to become desperate,\r\nas is very frequently observed. They express that by the idea that\r\nhe is hot-headed, and at such times they commit the most atrocious\r\ncrimes and suicide. He is cruel, and sheds blood with but little\r\nsymptoms of horror, and awaits death calmly. This is because he does\r\nnot feel so strongly as we do the instinct of life. He has no great\r\nspirit for hazardous enterprises, as for instance that of boarding a\r\nwarship, breaking a square, gaining a bridge, or assaulting a breach,\r\nunless he be inflamed by the most violent passions, that render him\r\nfrantic.\" (Mas, pp. 119-121.)\r\n\r\n[239] In M., \"to a great degree;\" and in D., \"in a certain manner.\"\r\n\r\n[240] D. reads \"on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\n[241] Delgado says (p. 318) that the sin of intoxication is\r\noverstated. Among the Visayans, intoxicating beverages are indulged\r\nin in differing degrees, while many are abstemious. \"I would like\r\nto hear what the Tagálog Indians who live among Spaniards in Manila\r\nwould say to this stain, that is imputed to them alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps this may have been so in the time of Father Gaspar, as the\r\nFilipinos preserved more of their ancient customs than now, for we\r\nsee that intoxication is very common in the independent tribes living\r\nin the mountains, but today it is not observed that the [civilized\r\nFilipinos] drink more than the individuals of other nations who are\r\nconsidered sober.\" (Mas, pp. 121, 122.)\r\n\r\n[242] Delgado denies that the Indians are robbers (p. 318).\r\n\r\n[243] Delgado says (p. 318): \"This passage is absolutely malicious, so\r\nfar as the Visayans are concerned; for no Visayan woman of good blood\r\nwill marry with other than her equal, however poor she be. And although\r\nall are of one color, they make great distinctions among themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same thing is recounted by Father Mozo to be the case among the\r\nmountain savages.\" (Mas, p. 122.)\r\n\r\n[244] i.e., \"At least as to manner.\"\r\n\r\n[245] D. omits this last clause.\r\n\r\n[246] An adaptation of an old proverb, probably meaning here, \"Although\r\nsins are committed here, they are not so frequent as in other places.\"\r\n\r\n[247] San Agustin speaks without sufficient authority, says Delgado\r\n(pp. 318, 319), for he only remained a short time in Panay, and\r\nlearned nothing of the other parts of the Visayans. \"I know very well\r\nthat what he imputes to the Visayan women is not absolutely true. For\r\ngenerally they detest not only Cafres and negroes, but also inequality\r\nin birth. They are not so easy as his Paternity declares in admitting\r\nany temptation, and there are many of them who are very modest and\r\nreserved.\" Bad women exist everywhere, even among the whites.\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt that modesty is a peculiar feature in these\r\nwomen. From the prudent and even humble manner in which the single\r\nyouths approach their sweethearts, one can see that these young\r\nladies hold their lovers within strict bounds and cause themselves\r\nto be treated by them with the greatest respect. I have not seen\r\nlooseness and impudence, even among prostitutes. Many of the girls\r\nfeign resistance, and desire to be conquered by a brave arm. This is\r\nthe way, they say, among the beautiful sex in Filipinas. In Manila no\r\nwoman makes the least sign or even calls out to a man on the street,\r\nor from the windows, as happens in Europa; and this does not result\r\nfrom fear of the police, for there is complete freedom in this point,\r\nas in many others. But in the midst of this delicacy of intercourse\r\nthere are very few Filipino girls who do not relent to their gallants\r\nand to their presents. It appears that there are very few young\r\nwomen who marry as virgins and very many have had children before\r\nmarriage. No great importance is attached to these slips, however\r\nmuch the curas endeavor to make them do so. Some curas have assured\r\nme that not only do the girls not consider it dishonorable, but think,\r\non the contrary, that they can prove by this means that they have had\r\nlovers. If this is so, then we shall have another proof that these\r\nFilipinos preserve not a little of their character and primitive\r\ncustoms; since, according to the account of Father Juan Francisco de\r\nSan Antonio, it was a shame for any woman, whether married or single,\r\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniards, not to have a lover, although\r\nit was at the same time a settled thing that no one would give her\r\naffection freely.\r\n\r\n\"That they are more affectionate than men is also a fact, but this\r\nis common to the sex in all countries....\r\n\r\n\"That they rarely love any Spaniards is also true. The beard, and\r\nespecially the mustache, causes them a disagreeable impression,\r\nand he who believes the contrary is much mistaken. Besides, our\r\neducation, our tastes, and our rank place a very high wall between\r\nthe two persons. The basis of love is confidence; and a rude Filipino\r\ngirl acquires with great difficulty confidence toward an European\r\nwho is accustomed to operas and society. They may place themselves\r\nin the arms of Europeans through interest or persuasion; but after\r\nthe moment of illusion is over, they do not know what to say and one\r\ngets tired of the other. The Filipino girl does not grow weary of\r\nher Filipino, for the attainments, inclinations, and acquaintances of\r\nboth are the same. Notwithstanding the Filipinos live, as I am told,\r\nconvinced that not one of their beauties has the slightest affection\r\nfor us, and that they bestow their smiles upon us only for reasons\r\nof convenience, yet I imagine that sometimes the joke is turned upon\r\nthemselves--especially if the Spaniard is very young, has but little\r\nbeard, and is of a low class, or can lower himself to the level of\r\nthe poor Filipino girl.\" (Mas, pp. 123-125.)\r\n\r\n[248] M. reads \"fishing.\"\r\n\r\n[249] D. reads \"gloomily.\"\r\n\r\n[250] M. reads \"For to define them categorically, with an essential\r\nand real definition.\" D. reads \"For to define them categorically,\r\nwith an essential and real substantial definition, awaits another.\"\r\n\r\n[251] M. omits the remainder of this paragraph; and the last sentence\r\nin D. reads: \"But it they had undertaken the task of defining the\r\nIndians, they would not have been so successful.\"\r\n\r\n[252] This was the French poet and theologian John Barclay, who\r\nwas born at Pont-à-Mousson, in 1582, and died at Rome, August 12,\r\n1621. He refused to enter the Society of Jesus, and followed his\r\nfather to England where he published a poem at the coronation of\r\nJames I, which found considerable favor. While in London he was\r\naccused of heresy, and was summoned to Rome by Paul V. In London\r\nhe published a continuation of his Euphormion, the first part of\r\nwhich had appeared in 1610. This consists of a Latin satire in two\r\nbooks. His Argenis was published in Paris in 1621, and there was a\r\nLeyden edition in 1630. It is a story, written in prose and poetry,\r\nof the vices of the court. It was very popular and was translated\r\ninto many languages.

He is said\r\nto have been born at Koma, Egypt, near Heraklea, A. D. 251, and to\r\nhave died A. D. 356. In early life he retired to the wilderness, and\r\nlived in seclusion until 305, when he founded the monastery of Fayum,\r\nnear Memphis and Arsinoë. He is the patron of hospitallers, and his day\r\nis celebrated on January 17. His life was written by St. Athanasius,\r\na condensed translation of which is given by S. Baring-Gould in his\r\nLives of the Saints (London, 1897, 1898), i, pp. 249-272.

See\r\nLarousse's Grand Dictionnaire.\r\n\r\n[260] St. Arsenius was a Roman of a noble and wealthy family, who\r\nbecame the tutor of the two sons of Theodosius at Constantinople. He\r\nfled to Egypt after the death of Theodosius, in shame at the poor\r\nresults of his teaching. There he lived in the desert, where he was\r\ncalled \"the father of the emperors.\" He died about 440, after a long\r\nlife of seclusion. He figures in Kingsley's story of Hypatia.

What temples could enjoy this blessing, or what walls be\r\nin confusion in any tumult, if the hand of Cæsar move?\"\r\n\r\n[271] \"All religious agree that they die with the utmost indifference,\r\nand that when they come to the bedside of the dying one, in order to\r\ncomfort him, they remain cold upon seeing how little those people\r\nare changed by the words that their approaching peril inspires in\r\nthem. Confessions at such a time are generally somewhat more sincere,\r\nbut always very short and stupid. The relatives are not at all careful\r\nabout talking of his death in the presence of the sick person--as,\r\nfor example, one of them remarking to the cura in a very natural\r\nand quiet voice in his uncle's presence (who still fully retained\r\nhis feeling and hearing): 'See, Father, it would be wise for you\r\nto consecrate the winding-sheet, for I think that he is about to\r\ndie soon.' The same indifference is to be observed in a criminal\r\ncondemned to any punishment. He is seated on his heels on a bamboo\r\nbench, smoking. Every few moments the religious enters to give him a\r\nChristian word, to which the criminal generally answers: 'Yes, Father,\r\nI know quite well that I have to die; what am I to do about it? I am an\r\nevil man; God so decrees; such was my fate;' and other things of this\r\nsort. He eats regularly, and sleeps as on any other day.... [This]\r\nis only one additional proof, and in my opinion, a not slight one,\r\nthat the Filipino race is inferior, at least in spiritual matters,\r\nto our race.\" (Mas, pp. 128, 129.)\r\n\r\n[272] The location of the above quotation is not given in the Ayer MS.,\r\nbut is given in both M. and D.\r\n\r\n[273] D. reads \"chatcere.\"\r\n\r\n[274] Possibly a reference to Proverbs ii instead of xx (where there\r\nis nothing that corresponds to this passage). The translation of the\r\nabove is: \"I walk in the ways of justice, in the midst of the paths\r\nof judgment, so that I may call myself diligent.\"\r\n\r\n[275] This is not quoted correctly, but should be: Venite ad me omnes,\r\nqui laboratis et onerati estis, et ego reficiam vos. The editor of\r\nD. has emended this passage.\r\n\r\n[276] This is the wrong reference. In the King James version, it is\r\nlxxii, 13, and in the Douay version, lxxi, 13.\r\n\r\n[277] i.e., \"For to him that is little, mercy is granted.\" This is\r\nnot in M.\r\n\r\n[278] The remainder of this paragraph, and all the next, are lacking\r\nin M.\r\n\r\n[279] i.e., \"No sacrifice is more acceptable to God than the zeal\r\nfor souls.\"\r\n\r\n[280] i.e., \"Ye therefore, my friends who are in the world, proceed\r\nwith security, and cry out and announce my will. I will dwell in your\r\nheart and in your mouth: I will be your leader on the way, and you\r\nconsolation at death. I will not leave you. Proceed with eagerness,\r\nfor glory increases from the labor.\" D. reads \"audacter,\" \"boldly,\"\r\ninstead of \"alacriter.\" M. gives but a portion of the citation.\r\n\r\n[281] This quotation is not exact, the correct version being as\r\nfollows: Patientia enim vobis necessaria est: ut voluntatem Dei\r\nfacientis, reportetis promissionem. It is not in M.\r\n\r\n[282] In D. \"placing.\"\r\n\r\n[283] M. is the only one of the three versions of this letter that\r\nlocates this citation correctly. We adopt the reading of the Latin\r\nVulgate, as San Agustin has not quoted exactly.\r\n\r\n[284] M. and D. omit these last four words.\r\n\r\n[285] M. and D. read \"variety of combinations of.\"\r\n\r\n[286] Of the remainder of the letter, Delgado says (p. 323): \"In\r\nregard to all the rest that the reverend writer adds, concerning\r\nthe manner in which those who live with the Indians ought to comport\r\nthemselves, I have nothing more to say or to add. For it is all well\r\nwritten and noted, and those who come new to these islands will do\r\nvery well to read it and to do as the reverend father prescribes,\r\nteaching the Indians to read and write and other knowledge, for they\r\nhave great capacity for all and at the same time, civilization, which\r\nis very necessary to them; and where they fail and sin, punish them\r\nas children, and not as slaves. By so doing they will obtain from\r\nthem whatever they wish.\"\r\n\r\nMas says (pp. 130, 131) of the advice given by San Agustin \"I would\r\nbe very glad, and it would be very advantageous for them, if all the\r\nSpaniards would adopt this system which is both wise and unique. But\r\nquite to the contrary, many persons think that the Filipinos ought to\r\nunderstand them at the slightest insinuation and very readily. For\r\nany fault they become impatient and call the Filipinos brutes, and\r\ncarabaos, and express themselves in the presence of the Filipinos\r\nin the most violent manner, and in the most insulting terms about\r\nthe race in general, even to the point of wishing to destroy them\r\nand other barbarous and sanguinary ideas of which their heart is not\r\ncapable. And they do not take note that such outbreaks of wrath only\r\nserve the purpose of confusing the Filipinos, rendering them more\r\nstupid, and rousing up hatred against them and all the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\n[287] In M. \"mildly.\"\r\n\r\n[288] M. gives the reference wrongly as the nineteenth verse.\r\n\r\n[289] i.e., \"Care must, in fact, be taken that the teacher and the\r\nfather and the mother give discipline to their subjects.\"\r\n\r\n[290] Not in M.\r\n\r\n[291] In D. \"and the merit lies in the patience.\"\r\n\r\n[292] i.e., \"Help the poor because of the commandment; and send him\r\nnot away empty-handed because of his poverty, etc.\" M. and D. add\r\nthe thirteenth verse, as follows: Perde pecuniam propter fratrem et\r\namicum tuum, et non abscondas illam sub lapide in perditionem. The\r\nEnglish of this is: \"Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend:\r\nand hide it not under a stone to be lost.\" To the above paragraph\r\nM. and D. add the following: \"For the merit becomes greater in\r\nproportion to their ingratitude if we fulfil our obligation and\r\nif they act according to their disposition. For, as says the royal\r\nprophet David (Psalm xxxvi, 21), Mutuabitur peccator, et non solvet:\r\njustus autem miseretur et tribuet.\"\r\n\r\n[293] This paragraph is divided into two paragraphs in M. and D. and\r\nis very much abridged. It is as follows: \"It is necessary that those\r\nIndians who are taken as servants, be shown no love if they are\r\nchildren, but always uprightness, for one must consider it as most\r\ncertain that in proportion as they are better clothed and caressed,\r\nthe worse they will become when they grow up. This is the teaching of\r\nthe Holy Spirit: [the verse from Proverbs as above follows]. They must\r\nbe treated with great uprightness and prudence, for otherwise they\r\nwill gradually lose their respect to the character that God presents\r\nto them in the Spaniard. [The fable of King Log follows as above.]\"\r\n\r\n[294] i.e., \"He who blows his nose too violently generally draws\r\nforth blood.\"\r\n\r\n[295] M. and D. make two paragraphs of the above, and read as follows:\r\n\"One must not press them to give more of themselves than they can, as\r\nwe do with the lemon, for that which will be expressed will be bitter,\r\nand, as says the proverb [in D.--\"and as says a law commentary\"]\r\nQui nimis emungit solet extorquere cruorem. We must remember in\r\nall this the teaching of the holy Council of Trent, session 13\r\n[in D.--\"3\"] de reformat, chapter I, whose words, although they are\r\nvery well worth reading, I omit on account of their length. It is not\r\nproper to go up into their houses, except when necessity requires it,\r\nkeeping therein the evangelical precept (Luke x, 7 [wrongly cited as\r\nxx]): Nolite transire de domo in domum. For one will lose much in\r\nestimation, while their vices [in D.--\"coldness\"] do not make this\r\na desirable diversion.\"\r\n\r\n[296] M. and D. add: \"anything is entrusted to them.\" The remainder\r\nof San Agustin's letter is omitted in D.\r\n\r\n[297] M. and D. add here: \"for thus does the Holy Spirit advise us.\"\r\n\r\n\"One day a friend of mine ordered a servant in my presence to go to a\r\ncertain house to ask in his name for the last gazettes from Europa. I\r\nadvised my friend to give the servant a note, since the latter would\r\ndoubtless give expression to some bit of nonsense. He took no notice\r\nof me, and sent the servant. In fact, the man understood \"aceite\"\r\n[i.e., \"olive oil\"], for \"gaceta\" [i.e., \"gazette\"], and returned\r\nwith a bottle of olive oil. His master was very much put out, while\r\nI burst into a roar of laughter. A peculiar thing is often observed\r\nin servants, namely, when one of them is ordered, 'Go to the house\r\nof Don Antonio,' before the message is finished the servant begins\r\nto go; and one has to call him back and say to him, 'But, man alive,\r\nwhere are you going?' and, if he is allowed to go, he reaches his\r\ndestination and says that he has been sent there, and then returns\r\nwhence he came, or utters some foolish remark.\" (Mas, p. 133.)\r\n\r\n[298] In the Vulgate, the last word of the Latin in this citation\r\nis eum.\r\n\r\n[299] i.e., \"at least in passing.\" This is not in M.\r\n\r\n[300] M. reads \"denude themselves of their customs.\"\r\n\r\n[301] M. reads: \"For the Indian who is ordained does not give himself\r\na trade because of the more perfect estate.\"\r\n\r\n[302] M. has instead of \"from the oar,\" \"from handling a bolo.\"\r\n\r\n[303] Spanish, la cuña del mismo palo; another application of an old\r\nSpanish proverb.\r\n\r\n[304] M. adds \"and those farthest from Manila, where also the remedy\r\nis very far away.\"\r\n\r\n[305] Spanish, sobre quítame allá esas pajas--literally, \"regarding\r\n'carry away these straws from me,'\" defined by the Academy's dictionary\r\nas, \"about a thing of little importance or value.\"\r\n\r\n[306] Picota: \"a column [the insignia of jurisdiction] or gibbet of\r\nstone, which is usually placed at the entrances of towns or villages;\r\non which are ignominiously exposed the heads of persons executed or\r\nof criminals\" (Bárcia, Dicc. etimológico).\r\n\r\n[307] M. adds \"to the father cura.\" The reason for this letter may be\r\nfound possibly in this paragraph, in the hostility of the religious\r\norders to admitting the Filipinos to the priesthood.\r\n\r\n[308] M. reads \"How well it could be subdued and composed.\"\r\n\r\n[309] M. adds \"in his happiness.\"\r\n\r\n[310] M. reads: \"And while they were all gallantly seated in the hall,\r\nand she was, very finely adorned with jewels, in the room, surrounded\r\nby many ladies.\"\r\n\r\n[311] M. reads: \"The bride spied the mouse from a long distance, and,\r\nnot being able to restrain herself out of respect for that function,\r\nshe arose and began to run the length of the hall. She overthrew the\r\npeople, and they were unable to restrain the fair bride, and cause\r\nher to desist from her undertaking. The angry groom said to them.\"\r\n\r\n[312] The rest of this sentence reads in M., \"even though they should\r\nbecome bishops.\"\r\n\r\n[313] Matthew xxv, 21.\r\n\r\n[314] i.e., \"The priesthood is the apex of all good things which\r\nexist among men.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Ignatius the Martyr was born about the middle of the first century\r\nof the Christian era, and is said to have been baptized by the apostle\r\nJohn. He was bishop of Antioch for forty years. Arrested by the Roman\r\nauthorities because of his preaching, he was sent to Rome, where he was\r\nkilled by wild beasts in the arena, probably about 107 A. D. He met the\r\nfamous Polycarp while on his way to Rome. Many epistles exist which are\r\nsaid to have been written by him, although some of them are probably\r\nspurious. His day is celebrated on February 1. See S. Baring-Gould\r\n(ut supra), ii, pp. 1-5, and New International Encyclopædia.\r\n\r\n[315] i.e., \"Concerning the dignity of the priesthood.\" M. adds:\r\n\"Nihil est in hoc secula excelentius sacerdotibus [i.e., 'There is\r\nnothing more excellent in this world than the priesthood']; and above,\r\nhorur igitur, et sublimitas sacerdotalis nullis poterit compurationibus\r\nadequari si regum fulgori compares, et principum Diademati longe erit\r\ninferius, quam si plumbi metallum aduri fugorem compares. [i.e.,\r\n\"Therefore the priestly reverence and height can be equaled by no\r\ncomparisons. If it be compared to the splendor of kings and the\r\ndiadem of princes, the comparison is far more inferior than if the\r\nmetal lead were compared to gleaming gold.\"] And of this Father Don\r\nAntonio Molina speaks at length in his admirable book.\"\r\n\r\n[316] St. Ambrose was one of the four doctors of the western church. He\r\nwas born at Trèves about 340 A. D., and received a good education in\r\nRome, and entered into the Roman civil service. Elected to the office\r\nof bishop of Milan, in what was regarded as a miraculous manner,\r\nhe soon became one of the great strongholds of the young religion of\r\nChristianity. To him was due the honor of receiving the great Augustine\r\ninto the Church. His death occurred in 397 A. D. His day is celebrated\r\non December 7; and in Milan he is regarded as a patron saint. The\r\nAmbrosian Library of that city is named for him. See S. Baring-Gould\r\n(ut supra), xv, pp. 74-104; and New International Encyclopædia.\r\n\r\n[317] Antonio de Molina was a Spanish theologian, who was born at\r\nVilla-Nueva-de-los-Infantes (Castilla). Entering the Augustinian order,\r\nhe taught theology, until he later retired to the house at Miradores,\r\nwhere he died September 12, 1612. He wrote a book called Instruccion\r\nde Sacerdotes, which was published in various places in Spain, and\r\nlater translated into various languages, among them the Latin. See\r\nHoefer's Nouvelle biographie générale, xxxv, col. 892.\r\n\r\n[318] Paulo Segneri, S.J. was one of the most illustrious men that\r\nthe Jesuit order has produced. He was a native of Nettuno, Italy,\r\nbeing born March 22, 1624, and entered the Society December 2,\r\n1637. He early became deaf through his excessive study. After\r\nteaching the humanities and rhetoric, he became a preacher and\r\nmissionary, traversing Italy on his missionary journeys during the\r\nyears 1665-1692. In 1692 he was called to Rome by Innocent XII, to\r\ntake the place of his preacher-in-ordinary. His death occurred at\r\nRome, December 9, 1694. His influence on Italy is ranked by some only\r\nsecond to that of Savonarola. His style in writing is regarded as of\r\nchief rank in purity and accuracy for his century. His writings were\r\nnumerous, and have been translated into many languages, some of them\r\ninto Greek and Arabian. The book mentioned in the text is Il parroco\r\ninstruito: opera in cui si dimostra a qualsisia curato novello il\r\ndebito che lo strigne, e la via da tenerse nell' adempirlo (Firenze,\r\n1692). See Sommervogel's Bibliothèque; and Hoefer (ut supra), xliii,\r\ncols. 685, 686.\r\n\r\n[319] The dignity of patriarch in the Catholic church (leaving\r\naside the papal rank) is the highest grade in the hierarchy\r\nof jurisdiction. Antioch early occupied a high place among the\r\npatriarchates, although with the lapse of time it lost its high\r\nposition; and finally, after the schism between the eastern and\r\nwestern churches, the appointee to that dignity did not actually assume\r\nthe office. See Addis and Arnold's Catholic Dictionary, pp. 35, 36,\r\nand 640. The patriarch mentioned in the text was the famous Cardinal\r\nCharles Thomas Millard de Tournon. See Vol. XXVIII, p. 118, and note\r\n56; Concepción, ix, pp. 1-123; and Crétineau-Joly, v, pp. 38-54.\r\n\r\n[320] These last two sentences are missing in M.\r\n\r\n[321] At this point the letter proper in M. ends with the words:\r\n\"May God preserve you for many years,\" and no signature follows. This\r\nis followed by the questions for men and women of Murillo Velarde.\r\n\r\n[322] In the text, legitimos; probably a transcriber's error for\r\nilegitimos (\"of illegitimate birth\").\r\n\r\nOther papal letters give leave to dispense with the above classes, who\r\ncould not, otherwise, be promoted to holy orders. Both classes could,\r\nalso, be raised to church dignities, but only to minor dignities,\r\nand not to high ones as bishoprics, etc. The distinction between\r\nespurios and [i]legitimos seems merely to have been a legal one,\r\nas both terms mean the same in effect.--Rev. T. C. Middleton, O.S.A.\r\n\r\n[323] i.e., \"It was lately related to us.\"\r\n\r\n[324] In the copy of this letter conserved in the collection of\r\nFray Eduardo Navarro of the Colegio de Filipinas, Valladolid, Spain\r\n(of which we have the transcription of a few pages at the end),\r\nthis word reads divina.\r\n\r\n[325] Antonio (not Pedro) Urceo, who was also called Codrus, was an\r\nerudite Italian, who was born August 14, 1446 at Rubiera, and died\r\nat Bologna in 1500. He was a good educator of youth, but of choleric\r\ntemper. While acting as tutor in one of the noble Italian families,\r\na fire destroyed most of his papers, which so worked upon him that he\r\nretired into almost complete seclusion for six months. In 1482 he went\r\nto Bologna, where he taught grammar and eloquence. Although during\r\nhis life he gave doubts of his orthodoxy, his death was all that\r\ncould have been wished. His works were published in four editions,\r\nthe first being at Bologna in 1502, under the title In hoc Codri\r\nVolumine hæc continentur Orationes, seu sermones ut ipse appelabat\r\nEpistolae. Silvae. Satyrae. Eglogae. Epigrammata. The translation of\r\nthe above citation is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Although thou be freeborn and sprung from noble parents;\r\n    Still even yet thou mayst be a base beast.\r\n    Add that thou art an honor to thy country, and claim the\r\n                                                    noblest kin;\r\n    Still even yet thou mayst be a base beast.\r\n    Thou mayst have wealth, thou mayst have abundance of\r\n                                              elegant furniture;\r\n    Still even yet thou mayst be a base beast.\r\n    In short, whatever thou shalt be, unless thou have prudence,\r\n    I declare that thou wilt ever be a base beast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the native priests of the Philippines, Delgado says (pp. 293-296):\r\n\"I know some seculars in the islands, who although Indians, can\r\nserve as an example and confusion to the European priests. I shall\r\nonly bring forward two examples: one, the bachelor Don Eugenio de\r\nSanta Cruz, judge-provisor of this bishopric of Santísimo Nombre\r\nde Jesús, and calificador of the Holy Office, a full blooded Indian\r\nand a native of Pampanga. And inasmuch as the author of this letter\r\nconfesses that the Pampangos are a different people, I shall name\r\nanother, namely, the bachelor Don Bartolomé Saguinsin, a Tagálog,\r\na cura of the district of Quiape (outside the walls of Manila), an\r\nIndian, and a native of the village of Antipolo. I knew his parents,\r\nand had friendly relations with them while I was minister in that\r\nvillage. Both men were esteemed for their abilities and venerated for\r\ntheir virtues, in Tagalos and Visayas.\" In addition, \"those reared\r\nin any of the four colleges in Manila, for the clerical estate are\r\nall the sons of chiefs, people of distinction among the Indians\r\nthemselves, and not of the timaua, or of the class of olipon, as the\r\nVisayan says, or maharlica or alipin, as the Tagálog calls the slaves\r\nand freedmen. The reverend fathers of St. Dominic or of the Society\r\nrear these boys and instruct them in virtue and learning; and if they\r\nhave any of the vices of Indians, these are corrected and suppressed\r\nby the teaching and conversation of the fathers. Furthermore,\r\nwhen the most illustrious bishops promote any of these men to holy\r\norders, they do not proceed blindly, ordering any one whomever to be\r\nadvanced--but only with great consideration and prudence, and after\r\ninforming themselves of his birth and his morals, and examining and\r\ntesting him first before the ministry of souls is entrusted to him;\r\nand to say the contrary is to censure the most illustrious prelates,\r\nto whom we owe so much veneration and reverence. Furthermore, there\r\nare among these Indians, many (and perhaps most of them) who are\r\nas noble, in their line of descent as Indians, as is any Spaniard;\r\nand some of them much more than many Spaniards who esteem themselves\r\nas nobles in this land. For, although their fate keeps them, in the\r\npresent order of things, in an almost abject condition, many of them\r\nare seigniors of vassals. Their seigniory has not been suppressed by\r\nthe king, nor can it be suppressed. Such we call cabezas de barangay\r\nin Tagálog, and Ginhaopan in Visayan. They and their children and\r\nrelatives lose nothing of their nobility because they serve the king\r\nin cutting timber, in the fleets, or in other personal services which\r\nare necessary in this land. As they lose nothing, it is also much\r\nhonor for them that the king be served by them. Accordingly, there are\r\nsargentos-mayor, masters-of-camp, captains, governors of the villages,\r\nand lieutenants, and all are Indians of distinction. These would not\r\ngo to row in a banca, and their hands would certainly be freed from\r\nhandling a bolo or an ax in the cutting of timber, and their mothers,\r\nwives, and daughters would not have become spinners, if it were not\r\nfor España. And although all the Indians seem of one color to the\r\nfather, this color is well distinguished among them; and they are\r\nvery respectful to their chiefs and much more so to their priests,\r\neven though these be Indians like themselves.\" Delgado continues\r\nby saying that, although some of the native priests have turned out\r\nbadly, that is not sufficient to condemn them all. It is arbitrary\r\nto declare that the Indian enters the priesthood solely for his own\r\ncomfort, and because of the respect shown him, and not because of the\r\nspiritual blessings. Many Spaniards also enter the ecclesiastical\r\nestate merely for a living. There are examples of Negro, Japanese,\r\nand Chinese priests. \"Consequently, it is not to be wondered at that\r\nthe most illustrious prelates and bishops should ordain Indians here\r\nand in Nueva España, and in other parts of the Indias.\"\r\n\r\n[326] The date of the Navarro copy is wrongly given as 1725.\r\n\r\n[327] Pedro Murillo Velarde was born August 6, 1696, at Villa Laujar,\r\nGranada, and entered the Jesuit novitiate at the age of 22. Having\r\nentered the Philippine missions, he was long a professor in the\r\nuniversity of Manila; and later was rector at Antipolo, visitor to\r\nthe Mindanao missions, and procurator at Rome and Madrid. He died\r\nat the hospital of Puerto Santa Maria, November 30, 1753. Murillo\r\nVelarde is one of the more noted among Jesuit writers. His principal\r\nworks are the following: Cursus juris canonici, hispani et indici\r\n(Madrid, 1743); Historia de la provincia de Philipinas de la Compañia\r\nde Jesus (Manila, 1749); and Geographica historica (Madrid, 1752),\r\nin ten volumes. In the Historia (which work we have used freely in\r\nthe present series, as material for annotation) was published his\r\nnoted map of the Philippine Islands, the first detailed map of the\r\narchipelago; it was made by order of the governor of the island,\r\nValdes Tamón, in 1734.\r\n\r\n[328] A kind of sausage composed of lean pork, almonds, pineapple\r\nkernels, and honey.\r\n\r\n[329] This sentence is missing in Father Navarro's copy.\r\n\r\n[330] Literally \"lose a foothold.\"\r\n\r\n[331] Delgado here refers to the \"Opinion\" by Murillo Velarde which\r\nis prefixed to vol. i of San Antonio's Chronicas; this is dated at\r\nSan Miguel, May 19, 1738, and contains a detailed description of the\r\nproducts of the islands--vegetable, animal, and mineral--from which\r\nwe extract his description of the peoples therein, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The natives of these islands are generally called Indians,\r\nbecause these islands are included in the demarcation of the Western\r\nIndias--although properly they are in the Eastern hemisphere, because,\r\nas they are distant from España more than a hundred and eighty\r\ndegrees of longitude, which makes the half-circuit [of the globe],\r\nit necessarily follows that they must be on the side of the East. All\r\nthe Indians resemble one another, especially in the yellowish-brown\r\ncolor and the flattened nose; and there is little difference between\r\nthe individuals. In the island of Negros, between Cavitan and Sipalay,\r\nI encountered heathen blacks with crinkled hair, as if they were from\r\nGuinea. The people who are here called creoles are of a swarthy brown\r\ncolor, with withered skin, and are quite civilized and capable. As for\r\nthe origin of the Indians, I am inclined to think that they originate\r\nfrom Malayos, on account of the similarity of their language; for\r\nby examining on various occasions a Malay (a native of Maláca) who\r\ncould speak several languages fluently, and a Ternatan, and Lutaos\r\nand Subanos, I have ascertained the following: In the Malay, \"sky\"\r\nis called languit, and the same in Tagálog, in Lutáo, and Subáno;\r\n\"man\" [varon] is lalaqui in Malay, as in the Tagálog and Bisayan;\r\n\"tongue\" is dila in Malay, as in Tagálog; \"white\" is puti in Malay,\r\nas in Tagálog, Subáno, and Lutáo. In other words the difference is but\r\nslight; thus, in Malay \"land\" is nigri, in Tagálog lupa, in Lutáo tana,\r\nin Boholan yuta; and \"man\" [hombre] is in Malay oran, in Tagálog tavo,\r\nin Lutáo aa, in Subáno gatao. The Indians are exceedingly clever in\r\nevery kind of handiwork, not for inventing, but for imitating what they\r\nsee. They write beautifully; many of them are tailors and barbers, for\r\nthey learn both these trades with little effort; and there are among\r\nthem excellent embroiderers, painters, and silversmiths; and engravers\r\nwhose work has no equal in all the Indias--and I was even going\r\nto place it far ahead of all the rest, if shame had not restrained\r\nme--as is very obvious in the many and excellent engravings which\r\nthey are all the time producing. They are good carvers, gilders, and\r\ncarpenters. They build vessels for these islands--galleys, galliots,\r\npataches, and ships for the Acapulco trade-route. They are good seamen,\r\nartillerists, and divers--for there is hardly an Indian who does not\r\nknow how to swim very well. They are the pilots of these seas. They\r\nexcel in making bejuquillos, which are golden chains of delicate\r\nand exquisite workmanship. From palm-leaves, rattan, and nito they\r\nmake hats, and petates or rugs, and mats, that are very handsome,\r\nand wrought with various kinds of flowers and other figures. They\r\nare noted as mechanics and puppet-players, and make complicated\r\nmechanisms which, by means of figures, go through various motions with\r\npropriety and accuracy. Some are watchmakers. They make gunpowder,\r\nand cast mortars, cannon, and bells. I have seen them make guns,\r\nas handsomely constructed as those made in Europe, although I do not\r\nthink that they would be as substantial and reliable as those. There\r\nare in Manila three printing-houses, and all keep Indian workmen;\r\nand the errors that they make are not numerous. They have remarkable\r\nskill in music; and there is no village, however small, that has\r\nnot a very respectable musician to officiate in the church. Among\r\nthem are excellent voices--trebles, contraltos, tenors, and basses;\r\nalmost all can play on the harp, and there are many violinists, and\r\nplayers on the oboe and flute. It is especially noticeable that not\r\nonly those whose trade it is to make these instruments do so, but\r\nvarious Indians, through love [for such work], make guitars, harps,\r\nflutes, and violins, with their bolos or machetes; and they learn to\r\nplay these instruments by only seeing them played, and without any\r\nspecial instruction. Almost the same thing occurs in other matters; and\r\non this account it is said that the Indians have their understanding in\r\ntheir eyes, since they so closely imitate what they see. Such are the\r\nIndians, when observed on the outside surface of their aspect; but when\r\none penetrates into the interior of their dispositions, peculiarities,\r\nand customs, they are a labyrinth, in which the most sagacious man\r\nloses his way. They appear ingenious and simple in countenance and\r\nwords, but they are masters eminent in deceit and feigning; under an\r\napparent simplicity they conceal an artful and crafty dissimulation. I\r\nbelieve that the Indian never fails to deceive, unless when his own\r\ninterests are hindered. In their lawsuits and business dealings they\r\nare like flies, which never quit what they are seeking, no matter how\r\nmuch they are brushed away; and thus they surpass and conquer us. The\r\nChinese say that the Spaniard is fire, and the Indian is water, and\r\nthat water quenches fire. They neither resent an injury nor thank one\r\nfor a kindness. If you give them anything, they immediately ask for\r\nanother. There is no fixed rule for construing them; for each one is\r\nneeded a new syntax, because they are anomalous. With them the argument\r\nis not concluded by induction, since no Indian resembles another,\r\nnor even is one like himself; for in the short round of one day he\r\nchanges his colors oftener than a chameleon, takes more shapes than a\r\nProteus, and has more movements than a Euripus. He who deals with them\r\nmost knows them least. They are, in fine, a union of contrarieties,\r\nwhich the greatest logician could not reconcile; they are an obscure\r\nand confused Chaos, in which species cannot be perceived or formal\r\nqualities distinguished; and if I had to define them I would say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Obstabatque alijs aliud, quia corpore in vno\r\n    Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis,\r\n    Mollia cum duris, sine pondere habentia pondus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[332] Alluding to the irregular tides in the straits of Euripus,\r\nbetween Euboea and Greece; during a large part of the month these tides\r\noccur as often as eleven to fourteen times during the twenty-four\r\nhours. Their irregularity occasioned among the Greeks a proverb,\r\nwhich Delgado here uses.\r\n\r\n[333] A name given by the inhabitants of Cuba to the natives of Mexico,\r\nand in Vera Cruz to those of the interior. The name is also applied\r\nto shrewd and brusque persons. (New Velázquez Dictionary.)\r\n\r\n[334] These two rules are respectively: \"Evil once, evil is always\r\npresupposed;\" and \"Evil [may spring] from any failing.\"\r\n\r\n[335] These chains were also of Chinese manufacture; apparently the\r\nFilipinos took up this industry through their tendency to imitate.\r\n\r\n[336] The Lygodium scandens, also called Gnito and nitongputi,\r\na climbing fern found throughout the Philippines. Blanco gives the\r\nname of the genus as Ugena. The glossy, wiry stems are used in the\r\nmaking of fine hats, mats, cigarette and cigar cases, etc. See Census\r\nof Philippines, iv, p. 166.\r\n\r\n[337] The balate is an echinoderm found abundantly in the Visayas, of\r\nwhich Delgado describes three varieties (p. 935): namely the Holothuria\r\nscabra (Jager), which is white; the Holothuria atra (Jager), which\r\nis black; and the bacongan or Synapta similis (Semper), which is of\r\nlarger size. The second variety is most esteemed. It was sold dry\r\nin the Visayas or taken to Manila and sold, where they were worth\r\nthirty-five or forty or even more silver pesos per pico. The Chinese\r\nespecially esteemed them (and do so yet) and large sums were paid\r\nfor them in that country. The Filipinos occasionally ate them fresh,\r\nbut only in the absence of fish.\r\n\r\n[338] Juan Francisco de San Antonio was born in Madrid in 1682, and\r\nmade his profession in the Franciscan order at the age of twenty. In\r\n1724 he brought a mission band to the islands, and spent there the rest\r\nof his life. His lifelong employ was in preaching, and as instructor in\r\ntheology--save fifteen years spent in Indian villages near Manila. He\r\ndied in that city May 29, 1744, the same year in which the last volume\r\nof his Cronicas was published. See Huerta's Estado, p. 537.\r\n\r\n[339] These are the Tagablis or Tagabili, also called Tagabelíes,\r\nTagabaloy, Taga-bulú, Tagbalooys, etc. Murillo Velarde, in his map,\r\nplaces them west of Caraga and Bislig in Mindanao, but this district\r\nhas been found to contain only Manobos and Mandayas. They are probably\r\nthe heathen Malay people living between the bay of Sarangani and Lake\r\nBuluan, whence their name, meaning perhaps \"people of Buluan.\" See\r\nBlumentritt's Native Tribes of Philippines (Mason's translation),\r\nand Census of Philippines, i, p. 476.\r\n\r\n[340] The cloth made from abacá alone is called sinamay; that\r\nmade of abacá and pineapple fiber, jusi; and that from a specially\r\nselected grade of abacá, much finer and more difficult to extract\r\nthan commercial hemp or that used in making other cloths, lupis. See\r\nCensus of Philippines, iv, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[341] Zúñiga (Estadismo) mentions the Chinese mestizo population of\r\nTambóbong or Malabón (now in Rizal province) as about 7,500. Some of\r\nthem had acquired by trade property to the value of 40,000 pesos. The\r\ntribute collected from all the Chinese mestizos of Luzon numbered\r\n10,500, over 8,000 of which came from the provinces immediately north\r\nof Manila--Tondó, Bulacán, and Pampanga. The Chinese mestizo element\r\nis very evident today in the provinces of Bulacán and Pampanga,\r\nand probably forms the principal element among the native owners of\r\nhaciendas. See Census of Philippines, i, pp. 435, 436, 438.\r\n\r\n[342] Spanish, con que se da Borney la mano; literally \"shakes hands.\"\r\n\r\n[343] An evident lapsus calami for Legazpi, such as has occurred in\r\nother writers.\r\n\r\n[344] A Moorish garment resembling a herdsman's jacket, with which\r\nthe body is covered and girt. It is still used on some festive\r\noccasions. (Dicc. Academia, 1726.)\r\n\r\n[345] See ante, p. 123, note 48.\r\n\r\n[346] Spanish, amusco, pero encendido; the last word, encendido, is\r\nliterally \"kindled,\" or \"glowing\"--that is, as here used, evidently\r\nreferring to a reddish tint given by the blood showing through\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\n[347] The name of this book is probably the Origen de los Indios de\r\nel nuevo mondo, e Indias occidentales (Valencia, 1607; 8vo). Garcia\r\nwas also the author of a book entitled Historia ecclesiastica y seglar\r\nde la Yndia oriental y occidental, y predicacion del sancto evangelio\r\nen ella por los apostolos (Baeça, 1626; 8vo).\r\n\r\n[348] See this report in Vol. VII, pp. 173-196. See also Vol. XVI,\r\npp. 321-329. But San Antonio quite overlooks the earlier relation by\r\nMiguel de Loarca (Vol. V, pp. 34-187).\r\n\r\n[349] Antonio de Padua or de la Llave went to the Philippines\r\nwith Gomez Perez Dasmariñas in 1590. He took the habit March 17,\r\n1591, and professed in the province of San Gregorio March 19, 1592,\r\nchanging his former name of Gonzalo to Antonio. After studying in\r\nthe Manila Franciscan convent, he became missionary in the village\r\nof San Miguel de Guilinguiling, in 1602, and afterwards in the\r\nvillages of Paete, Santa Cruz, Siniloan, Lilio, and Pila. He acted as\r\ndefinitor ad interim, from October 7, 1634 to January 13, 1635, and\r\nafter becoming missionary of Pila was appointed commissary-visitor,\r\nholding that office from June 12 to December 16, 1637. He served as\r\ndefinitor again in 1639, and finally died in the Franciscan convent\r\nof Mahayhay in 1645. He was the first chronicler of the province of\r\nSan Gregorio, and wrote the annals of his order from its founding in\r\nthe Philippines in 1577 to the year 1644, in two volumes; and a life\r\nof Gerónima de la Asuncion, foundress of the royal convent of Poor\r\nClares in Manila. See Huerta's Estado, pp. 452, 453.\r\n\r\n[350] Possibly a misprint for magaanito, as it is called elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[351] See ante, p. 191, note 101.\r\n\r\n[352] Noceda and Sanlucar's Vocabulario de la lengua Tagala (Manila,\r\n1860) defines tictic as the \"song of a nocturnal bird called apira,\r\nwhence the name was transferred to the bird itself. It is also known\r\nby the names of Lapira and Pirapira.\"\r\n\r\n[353] That is, evidently without having enjoyed any of the fruits of\r\nthe theft.\r\n\r\n[354] The Spanish edition of Juan de Solorzano Pereyra's Disputationem\r\nde Indiarum jure (Matriti, 1629-39; 2 vols., fol.), and of which\r\nlater editions were published. The title of the first edition of the\r\nSpanish work is Politica Indiana sacada en lengua castellana de los\r\ndos tomos del derecho i govierno municipal de las Indias Occidentales\r\nque mas copiosamente escribio en la Latina.  ... Por el mesmo autor\r\n... Anadidas muchas cosas que no estan en los tomos Latinos (Madrid,\r\n1648, fol.).\r\n\r\n[355] i.e., Sunday, Domingo being the Spanish word; evidence that\r\nthis method of styling the week was evolved after the conquest.\r\n\r\n[356] See Vol. III, p. 161, note 42.\r\n\r\n[357] The distance from the extremity of the thumb to the extremity\r\nof the index finger, when outstretched; hence a span.\r\n\r\n[358] For the above weights and measures, see Vols. III, p. 71, note\r\n20; p. 184, note 50; p. 253, note 87; and XV, p. 179, note 116. See\r\nalso Census of Philippines, i, p. 327; and iv, pp. 447-457 (a long list\r\nof weights and measures, with many tables, used in the Philippines).",
