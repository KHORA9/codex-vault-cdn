I\r\nmean the secret societies.... It is useless to deny, because it is\r\nimpossible to conceal, that a great part of Europe--the whole of Italy\r\nand France and a great portion of Germany, to say nothing of other\r\ncountries--is covered with a network of these secret societies, just as\r\nthe superficies of the earth is now being covered with railroads. And\r\nwhat are their objects? They do not attempt to conceal them. They do not\r\nwant constitutional government; they do not want ameliorated\r\ninstitutions ... they want to change the tenure of land, to drive out\r\nthe present owners of the soil and to put an end to ecclesiastical\r\nestablishments. Some of them may go further....\" (DISRAELI in the House\r\nof Commons, July 14, 1856.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of some regret to me that I have been so far unable to\r\ncontinue the series of studies on the French Revolution of which _The\r\nChevalier de Boufflers_ and _The French Revolution, a Study in\r\nDemocracy_ formed the first two volumes. But the state of the world at\r\nthe end of the Great War seemed to demand an enquiry into the present\r\nphase of the revolutionary movement, hence my attempt to follow its\r\ncourse up to modern times in _World Revolution_. And now before\r\nreturning to that first cataclysm I have felt impelled to devote one\r\nmore book to the Revolution as a whole by going this time further back\r\ninto the past and attempting to trace its origins from the first century\r\nof the Christian era. For it is only by taking a general survey of the\r\nmovement that it is possible to understand the causes of any particular\r\nphase of its existence. The French Revolution did not arise merely out\r\nof conditions or ideas peculiar to the eighteenth century, nor the\r\nBolshevist Revolution out of political and social conditions in Russia\r\nor the teaching of Karl Marx. Both these explosions were produced by\r\nforces which, making use of popular suffering and discontent, had long\r\nbeen gathering strength for an onslaught not only on Christianity, but\r\non all social and moral order.\r\n\r\nIt is of immense significance to notice with what resentment this point\r\nof view is met in certain quarters. When I first began to write on\r\nrevolution a well-known London publisher said to me, \"Remember that if\r\nyou take an anti-revolutionary line you will have the whole literary\r\nworld against you.\" This appeared to me extraordinary. Why should the\r\nliterary world sympathize with a movement which from the French\r\nRevolution onwards has always been directed against literature, art, and\r\nscience, and has openly proclaimed its aim to exalt the manual workers\r\nover the intelligentsia? \"Writers must be proscribed as the most\r\ndangerous enemies of the people,\" said Robespierre; his colleague Dumas\r\nsaid all clever men should be guillotined. \"The system of persecution\r\nagainst men of talents was organized.... They cried out in the sections\r\nof Paris, 'Beware of that man for he has written a book!'\"[1] Precisely\r\nthe same policy has been followed in Russia. Under Moderate Socialism in\r\nGermany the professors, not the \"people,\" are starving in garrets. Yet\r\nthe whole press of our country is permeated with subversive influences.\r\nNot merely in partisan works, but in manuals of history or literature\r\nfor use in Schools, Burke is reproached for warning us against the\r\nFrench Revolution and Carlyle's panegyric is applauded. And whilst every\r\nslip on the part of an anti-revolutionary writer is seized on by the\r\ncritics and held up as an example of the whole, the most glaring errors\r\nnot only of conclusions but of facts pass unchallenged if they happen to\r\nbe committed by a partisan of the movement. The principle laid down by\r\nCollot d'Herbois still holds good: \"Tout est permis pour quiconque agit\r\ndans le sens de la révolution.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was unknown to me when I first embarked on my work. I knew that\r\nFrench writers of the past had distorted facts to suit their own\r\npolitical views, that a conspiracy of history is still directed by\r\ncertain influences in the masonic lodges and the Sorbonne; I did not\r\nknow that this conspiracy was being carried on in this country.\r\nTherefore the publisher's warning did not daunt me. If I was wrong\r\neither in my conclusions or facts I was prepared to be challenged.\r\nShould not years of laborious historical research meet either with\r\nrecognition or with reasoned and scholarly refutation? But although my\r\nbook received a great many generous and appreciative reviews in the\r\npress, criticisms which were hostile took a form which I had never\r\nanticipated. Not a single honest attempt was made to refute either my\r\n_French Revolution_ or _World Revolution_ by the usual methods of\r\ncontroversy; statements founded on documentary evidence were met with\r\nflat contradiction unsupported by a shred of counter evidence. In\r\ngeneral the plan adopted was not to disprove, but to discredit by means\r\nof flagrant misquotations, by attributing to me views I had never\r\nexpressed, or even by means of offensive personalities. It will surely\r\nbe admitted that this method of attack is unparalleled in any other\r\nsphere of literary controversy.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that precisely the same line was adopted a\r\nhundred years ago with regard to Professor Robison and the Abbé Barruel,\r\nwhose works on the secret causes of the French Revolution created an\r\nimmense sensation in their day. The legitimate criticisms that might\r\nhave been made on their work find no place in the diatribes levelled\r\nagainst them; their enemies content themselves merely with calumnies and\r\nabuse. A contemporary American writer, Seth Payson, thus describes the\r\nmethods employed to discredit them:\r\n\r\n     The testimony of Professor Robison and Abbé Barruel would doubtless\r\n     have been considered as ample in any case which did not interest\r\n     the prejudices and passions of men against them. The scurrility and\r\n     odium with which they have been loaded is perfectly natural, and\r\n     what the nature of their testimony would have led one to expect.\r\n     Men will endeavour to invalidate that evidence which tends to\r\n     unveil their dark designs: and it cannot be expected that those who\r\n     believe that \"the end sanctifies the means\" will be very scrupulous\r\n     as to their measures. Certainly he was not who invented the\r\n     following character and arbitrarily applied it to Dr. Robison,\r\n     which might have been applied with as much propriety to any other\r\n     person in Europe or America. The character here referred to, is\r\n     taken from the American _Mercury_, printed at Hartford, September\r\n     26, 1799, by E. Babcock. In this paper, on the pretended authority\r\n     of Professor Ebeling, we are told \"that Robison had lived too fast\r\n     for his income, and to supply deficiencies had undertaken to alter\r\n     a bank bill, that he was detected and fled to France; that having\r\n     been expelled the Lodge in Edinburgh, he applied in France for the\r\n     second grade, but was refused; that he made the same attempt in\r\n     Germany and afterwards in Russia, but never succeeded; and from\r\n     this entertained the bitterest hatred to masonry; and after\r\n     wandering about Europe for two years, by writing to Secretary\r\n     Dundas, and presenting a copy of his book, which, it was judged,\r\n     would answer certain purposes of the ministry, the prosecution\r\n     against him was stopped, the Professor returned in triumph to his\r\n     country, and now lives upon a handsome pension, instead of\r\n     suffering the fate of his predecessor Dodd.\"[2]\r\n\r\nPayson goes on to quote a writer in _The National Intelligencer_ of\r\nJanuary 1801, who styles himself a \"friend to truth\" and speaks of\r\nProfessor Robison as \"a man distinguished by abject dependence on a\r\nparty, by the base crimes of forgery and adultery, and by frequent\r\nparoxysms of insanity.\" Mounier goes further still, and in his pamphlet\r\n_De l'influence attribuée aux Philosophes, ... Francs-maçons et ...\r\nIlluminés_, etc., inspired by the Illuminatus Bode, quotes a story that\r\nRobison suffered from a form of insanity which consisted in his\r\nbelieving that the posterior portion of his body was made of glass![3]\r\n\r\nIn support of all this farrago of nonsense there is of course no\r\nfoundation of truth; Robison was a well-known savant who lived sane and\r\nrespected to the end of his days. On his death Watt wrote of him: \"He\r\nwas a man of the clearest head and the most science of anybody I have\r\never known.\"[4] John Playfair, in a paper read before the Royal Society\r\nof Edinburgh in 1815, whilst criticizing his _Proofs of a\r\nConspiracy_--though at the same time admitting he had himself never had\r\naccess to the documents Robison had consulted!--paid the following\r\ntribute to his character and erudition:\r\n\r\n     His range in science was most extensive; he was familiar with the\r\n     whole circle of the accurate sciences.... Nothing can add to the\r\n     esteem which they [i.e. \"those who were personally acquainted with\r\n     him\"] felt for his talents and worth or to the respect in which\r\n     they now hold his memory.[5]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the lies circulated against both Robison and Barruel were\r\nnot without effect. Thirteen years later we find another American, this\r\ntime a Freemason, confessing \"with shame and grief and indignation\" that\r\nhe had been carried away by \"the flood of vituperation poured upon\r\nBarruel and Robison during the past thirty years,\" that the title pages\r\nof their works \"were fearful to him,\" and that although \"wishing calmly\r\nand candidly to investigate the character of Freemasonry he refused for\r\nmonths to open their books.\" Yet when in 1827 he read them for the first\r\ntime he was astonished to find that they showed \"a manifest tendency\r\ntowards Freemasonry.\" Both Barruel and Robison, he now realized, were\r\n\"learned men, candid men, lovers of their country, who had a reverence\r\nfor truth and religion. They give the reasons for their opinions, they\r\nquote their authorities, naming the author and page, like honest people;\r\nthey both had a wish to rescue British Masonry from the condemnation and\r\nfellowship of continental Masonry and appear to be sincerely actuated by\r\nthe desire of doing good by giving their labours to the public.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThat the author was right here in his description of Barruel's attitude\r\nto Freemasonry is shown by Barruel's own words on the subject:\r\n\r\n     England above all is full of those upright men, excellent citizens,\r\n     men of every kind and in every condition of life, who count it an\r\n     honour to be masons, and who are distinguished from other men only\r\n     by ties which seem to strengthen those of benevolence and fraternal\r\n     charity. It is not the fear of offending a nation amongst which I\r\n     have found a refuge which prompts me to make this exception.\r\n     Gratitude would prevail with me over all such terrors and I should\r\n     say in the midst of London: \"England is lost, she will not escape\r\n     the French Revolution if the masonic lodges resemble those I have\r\n     to unveil. I would even say more: government and all Christianity\r\n     would long ago have been lost in England if one could suppose its\r\n     Freemasons to be initiated into the last mysteries of the sect.\"[7]\r\n\r\nIn another passage Barruel observes that Masonry in England is \"a\r\nsociety composed of good citizens in general whose chief object is to\r\nhelp each other by principles of equality which for them is nothing else\r\nbut universal fraternity.\"[8] And again: \"Let us admire it [the wisdom\r\nof England] for having known how to make a real source of benefit to the\r\nState out of those same mysteries which elsewhere conceal a profound\r\nconspiracy against the State and religion.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe only criticism British Freemasons may make on this verdict is that\r\nBarruel regards Masonry as a system which originally contained an\r\nelement of danger that has been eliminated in England whilst they regard\r\nit as a system originally innocuous into which a dangerous element was\r\ninserted on the Continent. Thus according to the former conception\r\nFreemasonry might be compared to one of the brass shell-cases brought\r\nback from the battle-fields of France and converted into a flower-pot\r\nholder, whilst according to the latter it resembles an innocent brass\r\nflower-pot holder which has been used as a receptacle for explosives. The\r\nfact is that, as I shall endeavour to show in the course of this book,\r\nFreemasonry being a composite system there is some justification for\r\nboth these theories. In either case it will be seen that Continental\r\nMasonry alone stands condemned.\r\n\r\nThe plan of representing Robison and Barruel as the enemies of British\r\nMasonry can therefore only be regarded as a method for discrediting them\r\nin the eyes of British Freemasons, and consequently for bringing the\r\nlatter over to the side of their antagonists. Exactly the same method of\r\nattack has been directed against those of us who during the last few\r\nyears have attempted to warn the world of the secret forces working to\r\ndestroy civilization; in my own case even the plan of accusing me of\r\nhaving attacked British Masonry has been adopted without the shadow of a\r\nfoundation. From the beginning I have always differentiated between\r\nBritish and Grand Orient Masonry, and have numbered high British Masons\r\namongst my friends.\r\n\r\nBut what is the main charge brought against us? Like Robison and\r\nBarruel, we are accused of raising a false alarm, of creating a bogey,\r\nor of being the victims of an obsession. Up to a point this is\r\ncomprehensible. Whilst on the Continent the importance of secret\r\nsocieties is taken as a matter of course and the libraries of foreign\r\ncapitals teem with books on the question, people in this country really\r\nimagine that secret societies are things of the past--articles to this\r\neffect appeared quite recently in two leading London newspapers--whilst\r\npractically nothing of any value has been written about them in our\r\nlanguage during the last hundred years. Hence ideas that are\r\ncommonplaces on the Continent here appear sensational and extravagant.\r\nThe mind of the Englishman does not readily accept anything he cannot\r\nsee or even sometimes anything he can see which is unprecedented in his\r\nexperience, so that like the West American farmer, confronted for the\r\nfirst time by the sight of a giraffe, his impulse is to cry out angrily:\r\n\"I don't believe it!\"\r\n\r\nBut whilst making all allowance for honest ignorance and incredulity, it\r\nis impossible not to recognize a certain method in the manner in which\r\nthe cry of \"obsession\" or \"bogey\" is raised. For it will be noticed that\r\npeople who specialize on other subjects are not described as \"obsessed.\"\r\nWe did not hear, for example, that the late Professor Einstein had\r\nRelativity \"on the brain\" because he wrote and lectured exclusively on\r\nthis question, nor do we hear it suggested that Mr. Howard Carter is\r\nobsessed with the idea of Tutankhamen and that it would be well if he\r\nwere to set out for the South Pole by way of a change. Again, all those\r\nwho warn the world concerning eventualities they conceive to be a danger\r\nare not accused of creating bogeys. Thus although Lord Roberts was\r\ndenounced as a scaremonger for urging the country to prepare for\r\ndefence against a design openly avowed by Germany both in speech and\r\nprint, and in 1921 the Duke of Northumberland was declared the victim of\r\na delusion for believing in the existence of a plot against the British\r\nEmpire which had been proclaimed in a thousand revolutionary harangues\r\nand pamphlets. People who, without bothering to produce a shred of\r\ndocumentary evidence, had sounded the alarm on the menace of \"French\r\nImperialism\" and asserted that our former Allies were engaged in\r\nbuilding a vast fleet of aeroplanes in order to attack our coasts. They\r\nwere not held to be either scaremongers or insane. On the contrary,\r\nalthough some of these same people were proved by events to have been\r\ncompletely wrong in their prognostications at the beginning of the Great\r\nWar, they are still regarded as oracles and sometimes even described as\r\n\"thinking for half Europe.\"\r\n\r\nAnother instance of this kind may be cited in the case of Mr. John\r\nSpargo, author of a small book entitled _The Jew and American Ideals_.\r\nOn page 37 of this work Mr. Spargo in refuting the accusations brought\r\nagainst the Jews observes:\r\n\r\n     Belief in widespread conspiracies directed against individuals or\r\n     the state is probably the commonest form assumed by the human mind\r\n     when it loses its balance and its sense of proportion.\r\n\r\nYet on page 6 Mr. Spargo declares that when visiting this country in\r\nSeptember and October 1920:\r\n\r\n     I found in England great nation-wide organizations, obviously well\r\n     financed, devoted to the sinister purpose of creating anti-Jewish\r\n     feeling and sentiment. I found special articles in influential\r\n     newspapers devoted to the same evil purpose. I found at at least\r\n     one journal, obviously well financed again, exclusively devoted to\r\n     the fostering of suspicion, fear, and hatred against the Jew ...\r\n     and in the bookstores I discovered a whole library of books devoted\r\n     to the same end.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen then that a belief in widespread conspiracies is not\r\nalways to be regarded as a sign of loss of mental balance, even when\r\nthese conspiracies remain completely invisible to the general public.\r\nFor those of us who were in London during the period of Mr. Spargo's\r\nvisit saw nothing of the things he here describes. Where, we ask, were\r\nthese \"great nation-wide organizations\" striving to create anti-Jewish\r\nsentiments? What were their names? By whom were they led? It is true,\r\nhowever, that there were nation-wide organizations in existence here at\r\nthis date instituted for the purpose of combating Bolshevism. Is\r\nanti-Bolshevism then synonymous with \"anti-Semitism\"?[10] This is the\r\nconclusion to which one is inevitably led. For it will be noticed that\r\nanyone who attempts to expose the secret forces behind the revolutionary\r\nmovement, whether he mentions Jews in this connexion or even if he goes\r\nout of his way to exonerate them, will incur the hostility of the Jews\r\nand their friends and will still be described as \"anti-Semite.\" The\r\nrealization of this fact has led me particularly to include the Jews in\r\nthe study of secret societies.\r\n\r\nThe object of the present book is therefore to carry further the enquiry\r\nI began in _World Revolution_, by tracing the course of revolutionary\r\nideas through secret societies from the earliest times, indicating the\r\nrôle of the Jews only where it is to be clearly detected, but not\r\nseeking to implicate them where good evidence is not forthcoming. For\r\nthis reason I shall not base assertions on merely \"anti-Semite\" works,\r\nbut principally on the writings of the Jews themselves. In the same way\r\nwith regard to secret societies I shall rely as far as possible on the\r\ndocuments and admissions of their members, on which point I have been\r\nable to collect a great deal of fresh data entirely corroborating my\r\nformer thesis. It should be understood that I do not propose to give a\r\ncomplete history of secret societies, but only of secret societies in\r\ntheir relation to the revolutionary movement. I shall therefore not\r\nattempt to describe the theories of occultism nor to enquire into the\r\nsecrets of Freemasonry, but simply to relate the history of these\r\nsystems in order to show the manner in which they have been utilized for\r\na subversive purpose. If I then fail to convince the incredulous that\r\nsecret forces of revolution exist, it will not be for want of evidence.\r\n\r\nNesta H.

For whatever end they may\r\nhave been employed, the inspiration and methods of most of those\r\nmysterious associations which have played so important a part behind the\r\nscenes of the world's history will be found to have emanated from the\r\nlands where the first recorded acts of the great human drama were played\r\nout--Egypt, Babylon, Syria, and Persia. On the one hand Eastern\r\nmysticism, on the other Oriental love of intrigue, framed the systems\r\nlater on to be transported to the West with results so tremendous and\r\nfar-reaching.\r\n\r\nIn the study of secret societies we have then a double line to\r\nfollow--the course of associations enveloping themselves in secrecy for\r\nthe pursuit of esoteric knowledge, and those using mystery and secrecy\r\nfor an ulterior and, usually, a political purpose.\r\n\r\nBut esotericism again presents a dual aspect. Here, as in every phase of\r\nearthly life, there is the _revers de la médaille_--white and black,\r\nlight and darkness, the Heaven and Hell of the human mind. The quest for\r\nhidden knowledge may end with initiation into divine truths or into dark\r\nand abominable cults. Who knows with what forces he may be brought in\r\ncontact beyond the veil? Initiation which leads to making use of\r\nspiritual forces, whether good or evil, is therefore capable of raising\r\nman to greater heights or of degrading him to lower depths than he could\r\never have reached by remaining on the purely physical plane. And when\r\nmen thus unite themselves in associations, a collective force is\r\ngenerated which may exercise immense influence over the world around.\r\nHence the importance of secret societies.\r\n\r\nLet it be said once and for all, secret societies have not always been\r\nformed for evil purposes. On the contrary, many have arisen from the\r\nhighest aspirations of the human mind--the desire for a knowledge of\r\neternal verities. The evil arising from such systems has usually\r\nconsisted in the perversion of principles that once were pure and holy.\r\nIf I do not insist further on this point, it is because a vast\r\nliterature has already been devoted to the subject, so that it need only\r\nbe touched on briefly here.\r\n\r\nNow, from the earliest times groups of Initiates or \"Wise Men\" have\r\nexisted, claiming to be in possession of esoteric doctrines known as the\r\n\"Mysteries,\" incapable of apprehension by the vulgar, and relating to\r\nthe origin and end of man, the life of the soul after death, and the\r\nnature of God or the gods. It is this exclusive attitude which\r\nconstitutes the essential difference between the Initiates of the\r\nancient world and the great Teachers of religion with whom modern\r\noccultists seek to confound them. For whilst religious leaders such as\r\nBuddha and Mohammed sought for divine knowledge in order that they might\r\nimpart it to the world, the Initiates believed that sacred mysteries\r\nshould not be revealed to the profane but should remain exclusively in\r\ntheir own keeping, although the desire for initiation might spring from\r\nthe highest aspiration, the gratification, whether real or imaginary, of\r\nthis desire often led to spiritual arrogance and abominable tyranny,\r\nresulting in the fearful trials, the tortures physical and mental,\r\nending even at times in death, to which the neophyte was subjected by\r\nhis superiors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mysteries\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to a theory current in occult and masonic circles, certain\r\nideas were common to all the more important \"Mysteries,\" thus forming a\r\ncontinuous tradition handed down through succeeding groups of Initiates\r\nof different ages and countries. Amongst these ideas is said to have\r\nbeen the conception of the unity of God. Whilst to the multitude it was\r\ndeemed advisable to preach polytheism, since only in this manner could\r\nthe plural aspects of the Divine be apprehended by the multitude, the\r\nInitiates themselves believed in the existence of one Supreme Being, the\r\nCreator of the Universe, pervading and governing all things, Le\r\nPlongeon, whose object is to show an affinity between the sacred\r\nMysteries of the Mayas and of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks,\r\nasserts that \"The idea of a sole and omnipotent Deity, who created all\r\nthings, seems to have been the universal belief in early ages, amongst\r\nall the nations that had reached a high degree of civilization. This was\r\nthe doctrine of the Egyptian priests.\"[11] The same writer goes on to\r\nsay that the \"doctrine of a Supreme Deity composed of three parts\r\ndistinct from each other, yet forming one, was universally prevalent\r\namong the civilized nations of America, Asia, and the Egyptians,\" and\r\nthat the priests and learned men of Egypt, Chaldea, India, or China\r\n\"...kept it a profound secret and imparted it only to a few select among\r\nthose initiated in the sacred mysteries.\"[12] This view has been\r\nexpressed by many other writers, yet lacks historical proof.\r\n\r\nThat monotheism existed in Egypt before the days of Moses is, however,\r\ncertain. Adolf Erman asserts that \"even in early times the educated\r\nclass\" believed all the deities of the Egyptian religion to be identical\r\nand that \"the priests did not shut their eyes to this doctrine, but\r\nstrove to grasp the idea of the one God, divided into different persons\r\nby poesy and myth.... The priesthood, however, had not the courage to\r\ntake the final step, to do away with those distinctions which they\r\ndeclared to be immaterial, and to adore the one God under the one\r\nname.\"[13] It was left to Amenhotep IV, later known as Ikhnaton, to\r\nproclaim this doctrine openly to the people. Professor Breasted has\r\ndescribed the hymns of praise to the Sun God which Ikhnaton himself\r\nwrote on the walls of the Amarna tomb-chapels:\r\n\r\n     They show us the simplicity and beauty of the young king's faith in\r\n     the sole God. He had gained the belief that one God created not\r\n     only all the lower creatures but also all races of men, both\r\n     Egyptians and foreigners. Moreover, the king saw in his God a\r\n     kindly Father, who maintained all his creatures by his goodness....\r\n     In all the progress of men which we have followed through thousands\r\n     of years, no one had ever before caught such a vision of the great\r\n     Father of all.[14]\r\n\r\nMay not the reason why Ikhnaton was later described as a \"heretic\" be\r\nthat he violated the code of the priestly hierarchy by revealing this\r\nsecret doctrine to the profane? Hence, too, perhaps the necessity in\r\nwhich the King found himself of suppressing the priesthood, which by\r\npersisting in its exclusive attitude kept what he perceived to be the\r\ntruth from the minds of the people.\r\n\r\nThe earliest European centre of the Mysteries appears to have been\r\nGreece, where the Eleusinian Mysteries existed at a very early date.\r\nPythagoras, who was born in Samos about 582 B.C., spent some years in\r\nEgypt, where he was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis. After his\r\nreturn to Greece, Pythagoras is said to have been initiated into the\r\nEleusinian Mysteries and attempted to found a secret society in Samos;\r\nbut this proving unsuccessful, he journeyed on to Crotona in Italy,\r\nwhere he collected around him a great number of disciples and finally\r\nestablished his sect. This was divided into two classes of\r\nInitiates--the first admitted only into the exoteric doctrines of the\r\nmaster, with whom they were not allowed to speak until after a period of\r\nfive years' probation; the second consisting of the real Initiates, to\r\nwhom all the mysteries of the esoteric doctrines of Pythagoras were\r\nunfolded. This course of instruction, given, after the manner of the\r\nEgyptians, by means of images and symbols, began with geometrical\r\nscience, in which Pythagoras during his stay in Egypt had become an\r\nadept, and led up finally to abstruse speculations concerning the\r\ntransmigration of the soul and the nature of God, who was represented\r\nunder the conception of a Universal Mind diffused through all things. It\r\nis, however, as the precursor of secret societies formed later in the\r\nWest of Europe that the sect of Pythagoras enters into the scope of this\r\nbook. Early masonic tradition traces Freemasonry partly to Pythagoras,\r\nwho is said to have travelled in England, and there is certainly some\r\nreason to believe that his geometrical ideas entered into the system of\r\nthe operative guilds of masons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Cabala[15]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Fabre d'Olivet, Moses, who \"was learned in all the wisdom\r\nof the Egyptians,\" drew from the Egyptian Mysteries a part of the oral\r\ntradition which was handed down through the leaders of the\r\nIsraelites.[16] That such an oral tradition, distinct from the written\r\nword embodied in the Pentateuch, did descend from Moses and that it was\r\nlater committed to writing in the Talmud and the Cabala is the opinion\r\nof many Jewish writers.[17]\r\n\r\nThe first form of the Talmud, called the Mischna, appeared in about the\r\nsecond or third century A.D.; a little later a commentary was added\r\nunder the name of the Gemara. These two works compose the Jerusalem\r\nTalmud, which was revised in the third to the fifth centry[A]. This\r\nlater edition was named the Babylonian Talmud and is the one now in use.\r\n\r\nThe Talmud relates mainly to the affairs of everyday life--the laws of\r\nbuying and selling, of making contracts--also to external religious\r\nobservances, on all of which the most meticulous details are given. As a\r\nJewish writer has expressed it:\r\n\r\n     ... the oddest rabbinical conceits are elaborated through many\r\n     volumes with the finest dialectic, and the most absurd questions\r\n     are discussed with the highest efforts of intellectual power; for\r\n     example, how many white hairs may a red cow have, and yet remain a\r\n     _red_ cow; what sort of scabs require this or that purification;\r\n     whether a louse or a flea may be killed on the Sabbath--the first\r\n     being allowed, while the second is a deadly sin; whether the\r\n     slaughter of an animal ought to be executed at the neck or the\r\n     tail; whether the high priest put on his shirt or his hose first;\r\n     whether the _Jabam_, that is, the brother of a man who died\r\n     childless, being required by law to marry the widow, is relieved\r\n     from his obligation if he falls off a roof and sticks in the\r\n     mire.[18]\r\n\r\nBut it is in the Cabala, a Hebrew word signifying \"reception,\" that is\r\nto say \"a doctrine orally received,\" that the speculative and\r\nphilosophical or rather the theosophical doctrines of Israel are to be\r\nfound. These are contained in two books, the _Sepher Yetzirah_ and the\r\n_Zohar_.\r\n\r\nThe _Sepher Yetzirah_, or Book of the Creation, is described by\r\nEdersheim as \"a monologue on the part of Abraham, in which, by the\r\ncontemplation of all that is around him, he ultimately arrives at the\r\nconclusion of the unity of God\"[19]; but since this process is\r\naccomplished by an arrangement of the Divine Emanations under the name\r\nof the Ten Sephiroths, and in the permutation of numerals and of the\r\nletters of the Hebrew alphabet, it would certainly convey no such\r\nidea--nor probably indeed any idea at all--to the mind uninitiated into\r\nCabalistic systems. The Sepher Yetzirah is in fact admittedly a work of\r\nextraordinary obscurity[20] and almost certainly of extreme antiquity.\r\nMonsieur Paul Vulliaud, in his exhaustive work on the Cabala recently\r\npublished,[21] says that its date has been placed as early as the sixth\r\ncentury before Christ and as late as the tenth century A.D., but that it\r\nis at any rate older than the Talmud is shown by the fact that in the\r\nTalmud the Rabbis are described as studying it for magical purposes.[22]\r\nThe Sepher Yetzirah is also said to be the work referred to in the Koran\r\nunder the name of the \"Book of Abraham.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe immense compilation known as the _Sepher-Ha-Zohar_, or Book of\r\nLight, is, however, of greater importance to the study of Cabalistic\r\nphilosophy. According to the Zohar itself, the \"Mysteries of Wisdom\"\r\nwere imparted to Adam by God whilst he was still in the Garden of Eden,\r\nin the form of a book delivered by the angel Razael. From Adam the book\r\npassed on to Seth, then to Enoch, to Noah, to Abraham, and later to\r\nMoses, one of its principal exponents.[24] Other Jewish writers declare,\r\nhowever, that Moses received it for the first time on Mount Sinai and\r\ncommunicated it to the Seventy Elders, by whom it was handed down to\r\nDavid and Solomon, then to Ezra and Nehemiah, and finally to the Rabbis\r\nof the early Christian era.[25]\r\n\r\nUntil this date the Zohar had remained a purely oral tradition, but now\r\nfor the first time it is said to have been written down by the disciples\r\nof Simon ben Jochai. The Talmud relates that for twelve years the Rabbi\r\nSimon and his son Eliezer concealed themselves in a cavern, where,\r\nsitting in the sand up to their necks, they meditated on the sacred law\r\nand were frequently visited by the prophet Elias.[26] In this way,\r\nJewish legend adds, the great book of the Zohar was composed and\r\ncommitted to writing by the Rabbi's son Eliezer and his secretary the\r\nRabbi Abba.[27]\r\n\r\nThe first date at which the Zohar is definitely known to have appeared\r\nis the end of the thirteenth century, when it was committed to writing\r\nby a Spanish Jew, Moses de Leon, who, according to Dr. Ginsburg, said he\r\nhad discovered and reproduced the original document of Simon ben Jochai;\r\nhis wife and daughter, however, declared that he had composed it all\r\nhimself.[28] Which is the truth? Jewish opinion is strongly divided on\r\nthis question, one body maintaining that the Zohar is the comparatively\r\nmodern work of Moses de Leon, the other declaring it to be of extreme\r\nantiquity. M. Vulliaud, who has collated all these views in the course\r\nof some fifty pages, shows that although the name Zohar might have\r\noriginated with Moses de Leon, the ideas it embodied were far older than\r\nthe thirteenth century. How, he asks pertinently, would it have been\r\npossible for the Rabbis of the Middle Ages to have been deceived into\r\naccepting as an ancient document a work that was of completely modern\r\norigin?[29] Obviously the Zohar was not the composition of Moses de\r\nLeon, but a compilation made by him from various documents dating from\r\nvery early times. Moreover, as M. Vulliaud goes on to explain, those who\r\ndeny its antiquity are the anti-Cabalists, headed by Graetz, whose\r\nobject is to prove the Cabala to be at variance with orthodox Judaism.\r\nTheodore Reinach goes so far as to declare the Cabala to be \"a subtle\r\npoison which enters into the veins of Judaism and wholly infests it\";\r\nSalomon Reinach calls it \"one of the worst aberrations of the human\r\nmind.\"[30] This view, many a student of the Cabala will hardly dispute,\r\nbut to say that it is foreign to Judaism is another matter. The fact is\r\nthat the main ideas of the Zohar find confirmation in the Talmud. As the\r\n_Jewish Encyclopædia_ observes, \"the Cabala is not really in opposition\r\nto the Talmud,\" and \"many Talmudic Jews have supported and contributed\r\nto it.\"[31] Adolphe Franck does not hesitate to describe it as \"the\r\nheart and life of Judaism.\"[32] \"The greater number of the most eminent\r\nRabbis of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries believed firmly in\r\nthe sacredness of the Zohar and the infallibility of its teaching.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe question of the antiquity of the Cabala is therefore in reality\r\nlargely a matter of names. That a mystical tradition existed amongst the\r\nJews from remote antiquity will hardly be denied by anyone[34]; it is\r\ntherefore, as M. Vulliaud observes, \"only a matter of knowing at what\r\nmoment Jewish mysticism took the name of Cabala.\"[35] Edersheim asserts\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n     It is undeniable that, already at the time of Jesus Christ, there\r\n     existed an assemblage of doctrines and speculations that were\r\n     carefully concealed from the multitude. They were not even revealed\r\n     to ordinary scholars, for fear of leading them towards heretical\r\n     ideas. This kind bore the name of Kabbalah, and as the term (of\r\n     Kabbalah, to receive, transmit) indicates, it represented the\r\n     spiritual traditions transmitted from the earliest ages, although\r\n     mingled in the course of time with impure or foreign elements.[36]\r\n\r\nIs the Cabala, then, as Gougenot des Mousseaux asserts, older than the\r\nJewish race, a legacy handed down from the first patriarchs of the\r\nworld?[37] We must admit this hypothesis to be incapable of proof, yet\r\nit is one that has found so much favour with students of occult\r\ntraditions that it cannot be ignored. The Jewish Cabala itself supports\r\nit by tracing its descent from the patriarchs--Adam, Noah, Enoch, and\r\nAbraham--who lived before the Jews as a separate race came into\r\nexistence. Eliphas Lévi accepts this genealogy, and relates that \"the\r\nHoly Cabala\" was the tradition of the children of Seth carried out of\r\nChaldea by Abraham, who was \"the inheritor of the secrets of Enoch and\r\nthe father of initiation in Israel.\"[38]\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, which we find again propounded by the American\r\nFreemason, Dr. Mackey,[39] there was, besides the divine Cabala of the\r\nchildren of Seth, the magical Cabala of the children of Cain, which\r\ndescended to the Sabeists, or star-worshippers, of Chaldea, adepts in\r\nastrology and necromancy. Sorcery, as we know, had been practised by the\r\nCanaanites before the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites; Egypt\r\nIndia, and Greece also had their soothsayers and diviners. In spite of\r\nthe imprecations against sorcery contained in the law of Moses, the\r\nJews, disregarding these warnings, caught the contagion and mingled the\r\nsacred tradition they had inherited with magical ideas partly borrowed\r\nfrom other races and partly of their own devising. At the same time the\r\nspeculative side of the Jewish Cabala borrowed from the philosophy of\r\nthe Persian Magi, of the Neo-Platonists,[40] and of the\r\nNeo-Pythagoreans. There is, then, some justification for the\r\nanti-Cabalists' contention that what we know to-day as the Cabala is not\r\nof purely Jewish origin.\r\n\r\nGougenot des Mousseaux, who had made a profound study of occultism,\r\nasserts that there were therefore two Cabalas: the ancient sacred\r\ntradition handed down from the first patriarchs of the human race; and\r\nthe evil Cabala, wherein this sacred tradition was mingled by the Rabbis\r\nwith barbaric superstitions, combined with their own imaginings and\r\nhenceforth marked with their seal.[41] This view also finds expression\r\nin the remarkable work of the converted Jew Drach, who refers to--\r\n\r\n     The ancient and true Cabala, which ... we distinguish from the\r\n     modern Cabala, false, condemnable, and condemned by the Holy See,\r\n     the work of the Rabbis, who have also falsified and perverted the\r\n     Talmudic tradition. The doctors of the Synagogue trace it back to\r\n     Moses, whilst at the same time admitting that the principal truths\r\n     it contains were those known by revelation to the first patriarchs\r\n     of the world.[42]\r\n\r\nFurther on Drach quotes the statement of Sixtus of Sienna, another\r\nconverted Jew and a Dominican, protected by Pius V:\r\n\r\n     Since by the decree of the Holy Roman Inquisition all books\r\n     appertaining to the Cabala have lately been condemned, one must\r\n     know that the Cabala is double; that one is true, the other false.\r\n     The true and pious one is that which ... elucidates the secret\r\n     mysteries of the holy law according to the principle of anagogy\r\n     (i.e. figurative interpretation). This Cabala therefore the Church\r\n     has never condemned. The false and impious Cabala is a certain\r\n     mendacious kind of Jewish tradition, full of innumerable vanities\r\n     and falsehoods, differing but little from necromancy. This kind of\r\n     superstition, therefore, improperly called Cabala, the Church\r\n     within the last few years has deservedly condemned.[43]\r\n\r\nThe modern Jewish Cabala presents a dual aspect--theoretical and\r\npractical; the former concerned with theosophical speculations, the\r\nlatter with magical practices. It would be impossible here to give an\r\nidea of Cabalistic theosophy with its extraordinary imaginings on the\r\nSephiroths, the attributes and functions of good and bad angels,\r\ndissertations on the nature of demons, and minute details on the\r\nappearance of God under the name of the Ancient of Ancients, from whose\r\nhead 400,000 worlds receive the light. \"The length of this face from the\r\ntop of the head is three hundred and seventy times ten thousand worlds.\r\nIt is called the 'Long Face,' for such is the name of the Ancient of\r\nAncients.\"[44] The description of the hair and beard alone belonging to\r\nthis gigantic countenance occupies a large place in the Zoharic\r\ntreatise, Idra Raba.[45]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Cabala, every letter in the Scriptures contains a\r\nmystery only to be solved by the initiated.[46] By means of this system\r\nof interpretation passages of the Old Testament are shown to bear\r\nmeanings totally unapparent to the ordinary reader. Thus the Zohar\r\nexplains that Noah was lamed for life by the bite of a lion whilst he\r\nwas in the ark,[47] the adventures of Jonah inside the whale are related\r\nwith an extraordinary wealth of imagination,[48] whilst the beautiful\r\nstory of Elisha and the Shunnamite woman is travestied in the most\r\ngrotesque manner.[49]\r\n\r\nIn the practical Cabala this method of \"decoding\" is reduced to a\r\ntheurgic or magical system in which the healing of diseases plays an\r\nimportant part and is effected by means of the mystical arrangement of\r\nnumbers and letters, by the pronunciation of the Ineffable Name, by the\r\nuse of amulets and talismans, or by compounds supposed to contain\r\ncertain occult properties.\r\n\r\nAll these ideas derived from very ancient cults; even the art of working\r\nmiracles by the use of the Divine Name, which after the appropriation of\r\nthe Cabala by the Jews became the particular practice of Jewish\r\nmiracle-workers, appears to have originated in Chaldea.[50] Nor can the\r\ninsistence on the Chosen People theory, which forms the basis of all\r\nTalmudic and Cabalistic writings, be regarded as of purely Jewish\r\norigin; the ancient Egyptians likewise believed themselves to be \"the\r\npeculiar people specially loved by the gods.\"[51] But in the hands of\r\nthe Jews this belief became a pretension to the exclusive enjoyment of\r\ndivine favour. According to the Zohar, \"all Israelites will have a part\r\nin the future world,\"[52] and on arrival there will not be handed over\r\nlike the _goyim_ (or non-Jewish races) to the hands of the angel Douma\r\nand sent down to Hell.[53] Indeed the _goyim_ are even denied human\r\nattributes. Thus the Zohar again explains that the words of the\r\nScripture \"Jehovah Elohim made man\" mean that He made Israel.[54] The\r\nseventeenth-century Rabbinical treatise Emek ha Melek observes: \"Our\r\nRabbis of blessed memory have said: 'Ye Jews are men because of the soul\r\nye have from the Supreme Man (i.e. God). But the nations of the world\r\nare not styled men because they have not, from the Holy and Supreme Man,\r\nthe Neschama (or glorious soul), but they have the Nephesch (soul) from\r\nAdam Belial, that is the malicious and unnecessary man, called Sammael,\r\nthe Supreme Devil.'\"[55]\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this exclusive attitude towards the rest of the human\r\nrace, the Messianic idea which forms the dominating theme of the Cabala\r\nis made to serve purely Jewish interests. Yet in its origins this idea\r\nwas possibly not Jewish. It is said by believers in an ancient secret\r\ntradition common to other races besides the Jews, that a part of this\r\ntradition related to a past Golden Age when man was free from care and\r\nevil non-existent, to the subsequent fall of Man and the loss of this\r\nprimitive felicity, and finally to a revelation received from Heaven\r\nforetelling the reparation of this loss and the coming of a Redeemer who\r\nshould save the world and restore the Golden Age. According to Drach:\r\n\r\n     The tradition of a Man-God who should present Himself as the\r\n     teacher and liberator of the fallen human race was constantly\r\n     taught amongst all the enlightened nations of the globe. _Vetus et\r\n     constans opinio_, as Suetonius says. It is of all times and of all\r\n     places.[56]\r\n\r\nAnd Drach goes on to quote the evidence of Volney, who had travelled in\r\nthe East and declared that--\r\n\r\n     The sacred and mythological traditions of earlier times had spread\r\n     throughout all Asia the belief in a great Mediator who was to come,\r\n     of a future Saviour, King, God, Conqueror, and Legislator who would\r\n     bring back the Golden Age to earth and deliver men from the empire\r\n     of evil.[57]\r\n\r\nAll that can be said with any degree of certainty with regard to this\r\nbelief is that it did exist amongst the Zoroastrians of Persia as well\r\nas amongst the Jews. D'Herbelot, quoting Abulfaraj, shows that five\r\nhundred years before Christ, Zerdascht, the leader of the Zoroastrians,\r\npredicted the coming of the Messiah, at whose birth a star would appear.\r\nHe also told his disciples that the Messiah would be born of a virgin,\r\nthat they would be the first to hear of Him, and that they should bring\r\nHim gifts.[58]\r\n\r\nDrach believes that this tradition was taught in the ancient\r\nsynagogue,[59] thus explaining the words of St. Paul that unto the Jews\r\n\"were committed the oracles of God\"[60]:\r\n\r\n     This oral doctrine, which is the Cabala, had for its object the\r\n     most sublime truths of the Faith which it brought back incessantly\r\n     to the promised Redeemer, the foundation of the whole system of the\r\n     ancient tradition.[61]\r\n\r\nDrach further asserts that the doctrine of the Trinity formed a part of\r\nthis tradition:\r\n\r\n     Whoever has familiarized himself with that which was taught by the\r\n     ancient doctors of the Synagogue, particularly those who lived\r\n     before the coming of the Saviour, knows that the Trinity in one God\r\n     was a truth admitted amongst them from the earliest times.[62]\r\n\r\nM. Vulliaud points out that Graetz admits the existence of this idea in\r\nthe Zohar: \"It even taught certain doctrines which appeared favourable\r\nto the Christian dogma of the Trinity!\" And again: \"It is incontestable\r\nthat the Zohar makes allusions to the beliefs in the Trinity and the\r\nIncarnation.\"[63] M. Vulliaud adds: \"The idea of the Trinity must\r\ntherefore play an important part in the Cabala, since it has been\r\npossible to affirm that 'the characteristic of the Zohar and its\r\nparticular conception is its attachment to the principle of the\r\nTrinity,'\"[64] and further quotes Edersheim as saying that \"a great\r\npart of the explanation given in the writings of the Cabalists resembles\r\nin a surprising manner the highest truths of Christianity.\"[65] It\r\nwould appear, then, that certain remnants of the ancient secret\r\ntradition lingered on in the Cabala. The _Jewish Encyclopædia_, perhaps\r\nunintentionally, endorses this opinion, since in deriding the\r\nsixteenth-century Christian Cabalists for asserting that the Cabala\r\ncontained traces of Christianity, it goes on to say that what appears to\r\nbe Christian in the Cabala is only ancient esoteric doctrine.[66] Here,\r\nthen, we have it on the authority of modern Jewish scholars that the\r\nancient secret tradition was in harmony with Christian teaching. But in\r\nthe teaching of the later synagogue the philosophy of the earlier sages\r\nwas narrowed down to suit the exclusive system of the Jewish hierarchy,\r\nand the ancient hope of a Redeemer who should restore Man to the state\r\nof felicity he had lost at the Fall was transformed into the idea of\r\nsalvation for the Jews alone[67] under the ægis of a triumphant and even\r\nan avenging Messiah.[68] It is this Messianic dream perpetuated in the\r\nmodern Cabala which nineteen hundred years ago the advent of Christ on\r\nearth came to disturb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coming of the Redeemer\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that many Christian doctrines, such as the conception of a\r\nTrinity, the miraculous birth and murder of a Deity, had found a place\r\nin earlier religions has frequently been used as an argument to show\r\nthat the story of Christ was merely a new version of various ancient\r\nlegends, those of Attis, Adonis, or of Osiris, and that consequently the\r\nChristian religion is founded on a myth. The answer to this is that the\r\nexistence of Christ on earth is an historic fact which no serious\r\nauthority has ever denied. The attempts of such writers as Drews and\r\nJ.M. Robertson to establish the theory of the \"Christ-Myth,\" which find\r\nan echo in the utterances of Socialist orators,[69] have been met with\r\nso much able criticism as to need no further refutation. Sir James\r\nFrazer, who will certainly not be accused of bigoted orthodoxy, observes\r\nin this connexion:\r\n\r\n     The doubts which have been cast on the historical reality of Jesus\r\n     are, in my judgement, unworthy of serious attention.... To dissolve\r\n     the founder of Christianity into a myth, as some would do, is\r\n     hardly less absurd than it would be to do the same for Mohammed,\r\n     Luther, and Calvin.[70]\r\n\r\nMay not the fact that certain circumstances in the life of Christ were\r\nforeshadowed by earlier religions indicate, as Eliphas Lévi observes,\r\nthat the ancients had an intuition of Christian mysteries?[71]\r\n\r\nTo those therefore who had adhered to the ancient tradition, Christ\r\nappeared as the fulfilment of a prophecy as old as the world. Thus the\r\nwise men came from afar to worship the Babe of Bethlehem, and when they\r\nsaw His star in the East they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. In\r\nChrist they hailed not only Him who was born King of the Jews, but the\r\nSaviour of the whole human race.[72]\r\n\r\nIn the light of this great hope, that wondrous night in Bethlehem is\r\nseen in all its sublimity. Throughout the ages the seers had looked for\r\nthe coming of the Redeemer, and lo! He was here; but it was not to the\r\nmighty in Israel, to the High Priests and the Scribes, that His birth\r\nwas announced, but to humble shepherds watching their flocks by night.\r\nAnd these men of simple faith, hearing from the angels \"the good tidings\r\nof great joy\" that a Saviour, \"Christ the Lord\" was born, went with\r\nhaste to see the babe lying in the manger, and returned \"glorifying and\r\npraising God.\" So also to the devout in Israel, to Simeon and to Anna\r\nthe prophetess, the great event appeared in its universal significance,\r\nand Simeon, departing in peace, knew that his eyes had seen the\r\nsalvation that was to be \"a light to lighten the Gentiles\" as well as\r\nthe glory of the people of Israel.\r\n\r\nBut to the Jews, in whose hands the ancient tradition had been turned to\r\nthe exclusive advantage of the Jewish race, to the Rabbis, who had,\r\nmoreover, constituted themselves the sole guardians within this nation\r\nof the said tradition, the manner of its fulfilment was necessarily\r\nabhorrent. Instead of a resplendent Messiah who should be presented by\r\nthem to the people, a Saviour was born amongst the people themselves and\r\nbrought to Jerusalem to be presented to the Lord; a Saviour moreover\r\nwho, as time went on, imparted His divine message to the poor and humble\r\nand declared that His Kingdom was not of this world. This was clearly\r\nwhat Mary meant when she said that God had \"scattered the proud in the\r\nimagination of their hearts,\" that He had \"put down the mighty from\r\ntheir seats, and exalted them of low degree.\" Christ was therefore\r\ndoubly hateful to the Jewish hierarchy in that He attacked the\r\nprivilege of the race to which they belonged by throwing open the door\r\nto all mankind, and the privilege of the caste to which they belonged by\r\nrevealing sacred doctrines to the profane and destroying their claim to\r\nexclusive knowledge.\r\n\r\nUnless viewed from this aspect, neither the antagonism displayed by the\r\nScribes and Pharisees towards our Lord nor the denunciations He uttered\r\nagainst them can be properly understood. \"Woe unto you, Lawyers! for ye\r\nhave taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and\r\nthem that were entering in ye hindered.... Woe unto you, Scribes and\r\nPharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men:\r\ntor ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are\r\nentering to go in.\" What did Christ mean by the key of knowledge?\r\nClearly the sacred tradition which, as Drach explains, foreshadowed the\r\ndoctrines of Christianity.[73] It was the Rabbis who perverted that\r\ntradition, and thus \"the guilt of these perfidious Doctors consisted in\r\ntheir concealing from the people the traditional explanation of the\r\nsacred books by means of which they would have been able to recognize\r\nthe Messiah in the person of Jesus Christ.\"[74] Many of the people,\r\nhowever, did recognize Him; indeed, the multitude acclaimed Him,\r\nspreading their garments before Him and crying, \"Hosanna to the Son of\r\nDavid! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!\" Writers who\r\nhave cited the choice of Barabbas in the place of Christ as an instance\r\nof misguided popular judgement, overlook the fact that this choice was\r\nnot spontaneous; it was the Chief Priests who delivered Christ \"from\r\nenvy\" and who \"moved the people that Pilate should rather release unto\r\nthem Barabbas.\" _Then_ the people obediently cried out, \"Crucify Him!\"\r\n\r\nSo also it was the Rabbis who, after hiding from the people the meaning\r\nof the sacred tradition at the moment of its fulfilment, afterwards\r\npoisoned that same stream for future generations. Abominable calumnies\r\non Christ and Christianity occur not only in the Cabala but in the\r\nearlier editions of the Talmud. In these, says Barclay--\r\n\r\n     Our Lord and Saviour is \"that one,\" \"such a one,\" \"a fool,\" \"the\r\n     leper,\" \"the deceiver of Israel,\" etc. Efforts are made to prove\r\n     that He is the son of Joseph Pandira before his marriage with Mary.\r\n     His miracles are attributed to sorcery, the secret of which He\r\n     brought in a slit in His flesh out of Egypt. He is said to have\r\n     been first stoned and then hanged on the eve of the Passover. His\r\n     disciples are called heretics and opprobrious names. They are\r\n     accused of immoral practices, and the New Testament is called a\r\n     sinful book. The references to these subjects manifest the most\r\n     bitter aversion and hatred.[75]\r\n\r\nOne might look in vain for passages such as these in English or French\r\ntranslations of the Talmud, for the reason that no complete translation\r\nexists in these languages. This fact is of great significance. Whilst\r\nthe sacred books of every other important religion have been rendered\r\ninto our own tongue and are open to everyone to study, the book that\r\nforms the foundation of modern Judaism is closed to the general public.\r\nWe can read English translations of the Koran, of the Dhammapada, of the\r\nSutta Nipata, of the Zend Avesta, of the Shu King, of the Laws of Manu,\r\nof the Bhagavadgita, but we cannot read the Talmud. In the long series\r\nof Sacred Books of the East the Talmud finds no place. All that is\r\naccessible to the ordinary reader consists, on one hand, in expurgated\r\nversions or judicious selections by Jewish and pro-Jewish compilers,\r\nand, on the other hand, in \"anti-Semitic\" publications on which it would\r\nbe dangerous to place reliance. The principal English translation by\r\nRodkinson is very incomplete, and the folios are nowhere indicated, so\r\nthat it is impossible to look up a passage.[76] The French translation\r\nby Jean de Pauly[B] professes to present the entire text of the Venetian\r\nTalmud of 1520, but it does nothing of the kind.[77] The translator, in\r\nthe Preface, in fact admits that he has left out \"sterile discussions\"\r\nand has throughout attempted to tone down \"the brutality of certain\r\nexpressions which offend our ears.\" This of course affords him infinite\r\nlatitude, so that all passages likely to prove displeasing to the\r\n\"Hébraisants,\" to whom his work is particularly dedicated, are\r\ndiscreetly expunged. Jean de Pauly's translation of the Cabala appears,\r\nhowever, to be complete.[78] But a fair and honest rendering of the\r\nwhole Talmud into English or French still remains to be made.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even the Hebrew scholar is obliged to exercise some\r\ndiscrimination if he desires to consult the Talmud in its original\r\nform. For by the sixteenth century, when the study of Hebrew became\r\ngeneral amongst Christians, the antisocial and anti-Christian tendencies\r\nof the Talmud attracted the attention of the Censor, and in the Bâle\r\nTalmud of 1581 the most obnoxious passages and the entire treatise\r\nAbodah Zara were suppressed.[79]\r\n\r\nIn the Cracow edition of 1604 that followed, these passages were\r\nrestored by the Jews, a proceeding which aroused so much indignation\r\namongst Christian students of Hebrew that the Jews became alarmed.\r\nAccordingly a Jewish synod, assembled in Poland in 1631, ordered the\r\noffending passages to be expunged again, but--according to Drach--to be\r\nreplaced by circles which the Rabbis were to fill in orally when giving\r\ninstruction to young Jews.[80] After that date the Talmud was for a time\r\ncarefully bowdlerized, so that in order to discover its original form it\r\nis advisable to go back to the Venetian Talmud of 1520 before any\r\nomissions were made, or to consult a modern edition. For now that the\r\nJews no longer fear the Christians, these passages are all said to have\r\nbeen replaced and no attempt is made, as in the Middle Ages, to prove\r\nthat they do not refer to the Founder of Christianity.[81]\r\n\r\nThus the _Jewish Encyclopædia_ admits that Jewish legends concerning\r\nJesus are found in the Talmud and Midrash and in \"the life of Jesus\r\n(Toledot Yeshu) that originated in the Middle Ages. It is the tendency\r\nof all these sources to belittle the person of Jesus by ascribing to Him\r\nillegitimate birth, magic, and a shameful death.\"[82]\r\n\r\nThe last work mentioned, the _Toledot Yeshu_, or the _Sepher Toldos\r\nJeschu_, described here as originating in the Middle Ages, probably\r\nbelongs in reality to a much earlier period. Eliphas Lévi asserts that\r\n\"the Sepher Toldos, to which the Jews attribute a great antiquity and\r\nwhich they hid from the Christians with such precautions that this book\r\nwas for a long while unfindable, is quoted for the first time by\r\nRaymond Martin of the Order of the Preaching Brothers towards the end\r\nof the thirteenth century.... This book was evidently written by a Rabbi\r\ninitiated into the mysteries of the Cabala.\"[83] Whether then the\r\nToledot Yeshu had existed for many centuries before it was first brought\r\nto light or whether it was a collection of Jewish traditions woven into\r\na coherent narrative by a thirteenth-century Rabbi, the ideas it\r\ncontains can be traced back at least as far as the second century of the\r\nChristian era. Origen, who in the middle of the third century wrote his\r\nreply to the attack of Celsus on Christianity, refers to a scandalous\r\nstory closely resembling the Toledot Yeshu, which Celsus, who lived\r\ntowards the end of the second century, had quoted on the authority of a\r\nJew.[84] It is evident, therefore, that the legend it contains had long\r\nbeen current in Jewish circles, but the book itself did not come into\r\nthe hands of Christians until it was translated into Latin by Raymond\r\nMartin. Later on Luther summarized it in German under the name of _Schem\r\nHamphorasch_; Wagenseil in 1681 and Huldrich in 1705 published Latin\r\ntranslations.[85] It is also to be found in French in Gustave Brunei's\r\n_Evangiles Apocryphes_.\r\n\r\nHowever repugnant it is to transcribe any portion of this blasphemous\r\nwork, its main outline must be given here in order to trace the\r\nsubsequent course of the anti-Christian secret tradition in which, as we\r\nshall see, it has been perpetuated up to our own day. Briefly, then, the\r\nToledot Yeshu relates with the most indecent details that Miriam, a\r\nhairdresser of Bethlehem,[86] affianced to a young man named Jochanan,\r\nwas seduced by a libertine, Joseph Panther or Pandira, and gave birth to\r\na son whom she named Johosuah or Jeschu. According to the Talmudic\r\nauthors of the Sota and the Sanhedrim, Jeschu was taken during his\r\nboyhood to Egypt, where he was initiated into the secret doctrines of\r\nthe priests, and on his return to Palestine gave himself up to the\r\npractice of magic.[87] The Toledot Yeshu, however, goes on to say that\r\non reaching manhood Jeschu learnt the secret of his illegitimacy, on\r\naccount of which he was driven out of the Synagogue and took refuge for\r\na time in Galilee. Now, there was in the Temple a stone on which was\r\nengraved the Tetragrammaton or Schem Hamphorasch, that is to say, the\r\nIneffable Name of God; this stone had been found by King David when the\r\nfoundations of the Temple were being prepared and was deposited by him\r\nin the Holy of Holies. Jeschu, knowing this, came from Galilee and,\r\npenetrating into the Holy of Holies, read the Ineffable Name, which he\r\ntranscribed on to a piece of parchment and concealed in an incision\r\nunder his skin. By this means he was able to work miracles and to\r\npersuade the people that he was the son of God foretold by Isaiah. With\r\nthe aid of Judas, the Sages of the Synagogue succeeded in capturing\r\nJeschu, who was then led before the Great and Little Sanhedrim, by whom\r\nhe was condemned to be stoned to death and finally hanged.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of Christ according to the Jewish Cabalists, which\r\nshould be compared not only with the Christian tradition but with that\r\nof the Moslems. It is perhaps not sufficiently known that the Koran,\r\nwhilst denying the divinity of Christ and also the fact of His\r\ncrucifixion,[88] nevertheless indignantly denounces the infamous legends\r\nconcerning Him perpetuated by the Jews, and confirms in beautiful\r\nlanguage the story of the Annunciation and the doctrine of the\r\nMiraculous Conception.[89] \"Remember when the angels said, 'O Mary!\r\nverily hath God chosen thee and purified thee, and chosen thee above the\r\nwomen of the worlds.' ... Remember when the angels said, 'O Mary! verily\r\nGod announceth to thee the Word from Him: His name shall be Messiah,\r\nJesus the son of Mary, illustrious in this world, and in the next, and\r\none of those who have near access to God.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Mother of Jesus is shown to have been pure and to have \"kept her\r\nmaidenhood\"[90]; it was the Jews who spoke against Mary \"a grievous\r\ncalumny.\"[91] Jesus Himself is described as \"strengthened with the Holy\r\nSpirit,\" and the Jews are reproached for rejecting \"the Apostle of\r\nGod,\"[92] to whom was given \"the Evangel with its guidance and light\r\nconfirmatory of the preceding Law.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThus during the centuries that saw the birth of Christianity, although\r\nother non-Christian forces arrayed themselves against the new faith, it\r\nwas left to the Jews to inaugurate a campaign of vilification against\r\nthe person of its Founder, whom Moslems to this day revere as one of the\r\ngreat teachers of the world.[94]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Essenes\r\n\r\n\r\nA subtler device for discrediting Christianity and undermining belief in\r\nthe divine character of our Lord has been adopted by modern writers,\r\nprincipally Jewish, who set out to prove that He belonged to the sect of\r\nthe Essenes, a community of ascetics holding all goods in common, which\r\nhad existed in Palestine before the birth of Christ. Thus the Jewish\r\nhistorian Graetz declares that Jesus simply appropriated to himself the\r\nessential features of Essenism, and that primitive Christianity was\r\n\"nothing but an offshoot of Essenism.\"[95] The Christian Jew Dr.\r\nGinsburg partially endorses this view in a small pamphlet[96] containing\r\nmost of the evidence that has been brought forward on the subject, and\r\nhimself expresses the opinion that \"it will hardly be doubted that our\r\nSaviour Himself belonged to this holy brotherhood.\"[97] So after\r\nrepresenting Christ as a magician in the Toledot Yeshu and the Talmud,\r\nJewish tradition seeks to explain His miraculous works as those of a\r\nmere healer--an idea that we shall find descending right through the\r\nsecret societies to this day. Of course if this were true, if the\r\nmiracles of Christ were simply due to a knowledge of natural laws and\r\nHis doctrines were the outcome of a sect, the whole theory of His divine\r\npower and mission falls to the ground. This is why it is essential to\r\nexpose the fallacies and even the bad faith on which the attempt to\r\nidentify Him with the Essenes is based.\r\n\r\nNow, we have only to study the Gospels carefully in order to realize\r\nthat the teachings of Christ were totally different from those peculiar\r\nto the Essenes.[98] Christ did not live in a fraternity, but, as Dr.\r\nGinsburg himself points out, associated with publicans and sinners. The\r\nEssenes did not frequent the Temple and Christ was there frequently. The\r\nEssenes disapproved of wine and marriage, whilst Christ sanctioned\r\nmarriage by His presence at the wedding of Cana in Galilee and there\r\nturned water into wine. A further point, the most conclusive of all, Dr.\r\nGinsburg ignores, namely, that one of the principal traits of the\r\nEssenes which distinguished them from the other Jewish sects of their\r\nday was their disapproval of ointment, which they regarded as defiling,\r\nwhilst Christ not only commended the woman who brought the precious jar\r\nof ointment, but reproached Simon for the omission: \"My head with oil\r\nthou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed My feet with\r\nointment.\" It is obvious that if Christ had been an Essene but had\r\ndeparted from His usual custom on this occasion out of deference to the\r\nwoman's feelings, he would have understood why Simon had not offered Him\r\nthe same attention, and at any rate Simon would have excused himself on\r\nthese grounds. Further, if His disciples had been Essenes, would they\r\nnot have protested against this violation of their principles, instead\r\nof merely objecting that the ointment was of too costly a kind?\r\n\r\nBut it is in attributing to Christ the Communistic doctrines of the\r\nEssenes that Dr. Ginsburg's conclusions are the most misleading--a point\r\nof particular importance in view of the fact that it is on this false\r\nhypothesis that so-called \"Christian Socialism\" has been built up. \"The\r\nEssenes,\" he writes, \"had all things in common, and appointed one of the\r\nbrethren as steward to manage the common bag; so the primitive\r\nChristians (Acts ii. 44, 45, iv. 32-4; John xii. 6, xiii. 29).\" It is\r\nperfectly true that, as the first reference to the Acts testifies, some\r\nof the primitive Christians after the death of Christ formed themselves\r\ninto a body having all things in common, but there is not the slightest\r\nevidence that Christ and His disciples followed this principle. The\r\nsolitary passages in the Gospel of St. John, which are all that Dr.\r\nGinsburg can quote in support of this contention, may have referred to\r\nan alms-bag or a fund for certain expenses, not to a common pool of all\r\nmonetary wealth. Still less is there any evidence that Christ advocated\r\nCommunism to the world in general. When the young man having great\r\npossessions asked what he should do to inherit eternal life, Christ told\r\nhim to follow the commandments, but on the young man asking what more he\r\ncould do, answered: \"If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast\r\nand give to the poor.\" Renunciation--but not the pooling--of all wealth\r\nwas thus a counsel of perfection for the few who desired to devote their\r\nlives to God, as monks and nuns have always done, and bore no relation\r\nto the Communistic system of the Essenes.\r\n\r\nDr. Ginsburg goes on to say: \"Essenism put all its members on the same\r\nlevel, forbidding the exercise of authority of one over the other and\r\nenjoining mutual service; so Christ (Matt. xx. 25-8; Mark ix. 35-7, x.\r\n42-5). Essenism commanded its disciples to call no man master upon the\r\nearth; so Christ (Matt. xxiii. 8-10).\" As a matter of fact, Christ\r\nstrongly upheld the exercise of authority, not only in the oft-quoted\r\npassage, \"Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's,\" but in His\r\napproval of the Centurion's speech: \"I am a man under authority, having\r\nsoldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to\r\nanother, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth\r\nit.\" Everywhere Christ commends the faithful servant and enjoins\r\nobedience to masters. If we look up the reference to the Gospel of St.\r\nMatthew where Dr. Ginsburg says that Christ commanded His disciples to\r\ncall no man master on earth, we shall find that he has not only\r\nperverted the sense of the passage but reversed the order of the words,\r\nwhich, following on a denunciation of the Jewish Rabbis, runs thus: \"But\r\nbe not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Christ, and all ye\r\nare brethren.... Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master,\r\neven Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\"\r\nThe apostles were therefore, never ordered to call no man master, but\r\nnot to be called master themselves. Moreover, if we refer to the Greek\r\ntext, we shall see that this was meant in a spiritual and not a social\r\nsense. The word for \"master\" here given is in the first verse διδάσκαλος,\r\ni.e. teacher, in the second, καθηγητὴς literally\r\nguide, and the word is servant is διακὸνοσ. When masters and\r\nservants in the social sense are referred to in the Gospels, the word\r\nemployed for master is κύριος and for servant δοῦλος.\r\nDr. Ginsburg should have been aware of this distinction and that the\r\npassage in question had therefore no bearing on his argument. As a\r\nmatter of fact it would appear that some of the apostles kept servants,\r\nsince Christ commends them for exacting strict attention to duty:\r\n\r\n     Which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will\r\n     say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit\r\n     down to meat? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready\r\n     wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have\r\n     eaten and drunken; and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink? Doth he\r\n     thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded to\r\n     him? I trow not.[99]\r\n\r\nThis passage would alone suffice to show that Christ and His apostles\r\ndid not inhabit communities where all were equal, but followed the usual\r\npractices of the social system under which they lived, though adopting\r\ncertain rules, such as taking only one garment and carrying no money\r\nwhen they went on journeys. Those resemblances between the teaching of\r\nthe Essenes and the Sermon on the Mount which Dr. Ginsburg indicates\r\nrefer not to the customs of a sect, but to general precepts for human\r\nconduct--humility, meekness, charity, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is clear that if the Essenes in general conformed to\r\nsome of the principles laid down by Christ, certain of their doctrines\r\nwere completely at variance with those of Christ and of primitive\r\nChristians, in particular their custom of praying to the rising sun and\r\ntheir disbelief in the resurrection of the body.[100] St. Paul denounces\r\nasceticism, the cardinal doctrine of the Essenes, in unmeasured terms,\r\nwarning the brethren that \"in the latter times some shall depart from\r\nthe faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils, ...\r\nforbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God\r\nhath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and\r\nknow the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be\r\nrefused, if it be received with thanksgiving ... If thou put the\r\nbrethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister\r\nof Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nThis would suggest that certain Essenean ideas had crept into Christian\r\ncommunities and were regarded by those who remembered Christ's true\r\nteaching as a dangerous perversion.\r\n\r\nThe Essenes were therefore not Christians, but a secret society,\r\npractising four degrees of initiation, and bound by terrible oaths not\r\nto divulge the sacred mysteries confided to them. And what were those\r\nmysteries but those of the Jewish secret tradition which we now know as\r\nthe Cabala? Dr. Ginsburg throws an important light on Essenism when, in\r\none passage alone, he refers to the obligation of the Essenes \"not to\r\ndivulge the secret doctrines to anyone, ... carefully to preserve the\r\nbooks belonging to their sect and the names of the angels or the\r\nmysteries connected with the Tetragrammaton and the other names of God\r\nand the angels, comprised in the theosophy as well as with the cosmogony\r\nwhich also played so important a part among the Jewish mystics and the\r\nKabbalists.\"[101] The truth is clearly that the Essenes were Cabalists,\r\nthough doubtless Cabalists of a superior kind. The Cabal they possessed\r\nvery possibly descended from pre-Christian times and had remained\r\nuncontaminated by the anti-Christian strain introduced into it by the\r\nRabbis after the death of Christ.[102]\r\n\r\nThe Essenes are of importance to the subject of this book as the first\r\nof the secret societies from which a direct line of tradition can be\r\ntraced up to the present day. But if in this peaceful community no\r\nactually anti-Christian influence is to be discerned, the same cannot be\r\nsaid of the succeeding pseudo-Christian sects which, whilst professing\r\nChristianity, mingled with Christian doctrines the poison of the\r\nperverted Cabala, main source of the errors which henceforth rent the\r\nChristian Church in twain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gnostics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first school of thought to create a schism in Christianity was the\r\ncollection of sects known under the generic name of Gnosticism. In its\r\npurer forms Gnosticism aimed at supplementing faith by knowledge of\r\neternal verities and at giving a wider meaning to Christianity by\r\nlinking it up with earlier faiths. \"The belief that the divinity had\r\nbeen manifested in the religious institutions of all nations\"[103] thus\r\nled to the conception of a sort of universal religion containing the\r\ndivine elements of all.\r\n\r\nGnosticism, however, as the _Jewish Encyclopædia_ points out, \"was\r\nJewish in character long before it became Christian.\"[104] M. Matter\r\nindicates Syria and Palestine as its cradle and Alexandria as the centre\r\nby which it was influenced at the time of its alliance with\r\nChristianity. This influence again was predominantly Jewish. Philo and\r\nAristobulus, the leading Jewish philosophers of Alexandria, \"wholly\r\nattached to the ancient religion of their fathers, both resolved to\r\nadorn it with the spoils of other systems and to open to Judaism the way\r\nto immense conquests.\"[105] This method of borrowing from other races\r\nand religions those ideas useful for their purpose has always been the\r\ncustom of the Jews. The Cabala, as we have seen, was made up of these\r\nheterogeneous elements. And it is here we find the principal progenitor\r\nof Gnosticism. The Freemason Ragon gives the clue in the words: \"The\r\nCabala is the key of the occult sciences. The Gnostics were born of the\r\nCabalists.\"[106]\r\n\r\nFor the Cabala was much older than the Gnostics. Modern historians who\r\ndate it merely from the publication of the Zohar by Moses de Leon in the\r\nthirteenth century or from the school of Luria in the sixteenth century\r\nobscure this most important fact which Jewish savants have always\r\nclearly, recognized.[107] The _Jewish Encyclopædia_, whilst denying the\r\ncertainty of connexion between Gnosticism and the Cabala, nevertheless\r\nadmits that the investigations of the anti-Cabalist Graetz \"must be\r\nresumed on a new basis,\" and it goes on to show that \"it was Alexandria\r\nof the first century, or earlier, with her strange commingling of\r\nEgyptian, Chaldean, Judean, and Greek culture which furnished soil and\r\nseeds for that mystic philosophy.\"[108] But since Alexandria was at the\r\nsame period the home of Gnosticism, which was formed from the same\r\nelements enumerated here, the connexion between the two systems is\r\nclearly evident. M. Matter is therefore right in saying that Gnosticism\r\nwas not a defection from Christianity, but a combination of systems into\r\nwhich a few Christian elements were introduced. The result of Gnosticism\r\nwas thus not to christianize the Cabala, but to cabalize Christianity by\r\nmingling its pure and simple teaching with theosophy and even magic. The\r\n_Jewish Encyclopædia_ quotes the opinion that \"the central doctrine of\r\nGnosticism--a movement closely connected with Jewish mysticism--was\r\nnothing else than the attempt to liberate the soul and unite it with\r\nGod\"; but as this was apparently to be effected \"through the employment\r\nof mysteries, incantations, names of angels,\" etc., it will be seen how\r\nwidely even this phase of Gnosticism differs from Christianity and\r\nidentifies itself with the magical Cabala of the Jews.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the man generally recognized as the founder of Gnosticism, a Jew\r\ncommonly known as Simon Magus, was not only a Cabalist mystic but\r\navowedly a magician, who with a band of Jews, including his master\r\nDositheus and his disciples Menander and Cerinthus, instituted a\r\npriesthood of the Mysteries and practised occult arts and\r\nexorcisms.[109] It was this Simon of whom we read in the Acts of the\r\nApostles that he \"bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that\r\nhimself was some great one: to whom they all gave heed from the least to\r\nthe greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God,\" and who\r\nsought to purchase the power of the laying on of hands with money.\r\nSimon, indeed, crazed by his incantations and ecstasies, developed\r\nmegalomania in an acute form, arrogating to himself divine honours and\r\naspiring to the adoration of the whole world. According to a\r\ncontemporary legend, he eventually became sorcerer to Nero and ended his\r\nlife in Rome.[110]\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of sorcery amongst the Jews during the first century of\r\nthe Christian era is shown by other passages in the Acts of the\r\nApostles; in Paphos the \"false prophet,\" a Jew, whose surname was\r\nBar-Jesus, otherwise known as \"Elymas the sorcerer,\" opposed the\r\nteaching of St. Paul and brought on himself the imprecation: \"O full of\r\nall subtlety and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of\r\nall righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the\r\nLord?\"\r\n\r\nPerversion is the keynote of all the debased forms of Gnosticism.\r\nAccording to Eliphas Lévi, certain of the Gnostics introduced into their\r\nrites that profanation of Christian mysteries which was to form the\r\nbasis of black magic in the Middle Ages.[111] The glorification of evil,\r\nwhich plays so important a part in the modern revolutionary movement,\r\nconstituted the creed of the Ophites, who worshipped the Serpent\r\n(ὅφις) because he had revolted against Jehovah, to whom they\r\nreferred under the Cabalistic term of the \"demiurgus,\"[112] and still\r\nmore of the Cainites, so-called from their cult of Cain, whom, with\r\nDathan and Abiram, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, and finally\r\nJudas Iscariot, they regarded as noble victims of the demiurgus.[113]\r\nAnimated by hatred of all social and moral order, the Cainites \"called\r\nupon all men to destroy the works of God and to commit every kind of\r\ninfamy.\"[114]\r\n\r\nThese men were therefore not only the enemies of Christianity but of\r\northodox Judaism, since it was against the Jehovah of the Jews that\r\ntheir hatred was particularly directed. Another Gnostic sect, the\r\nCarpocratians, followers of Carpocrates of Alexandria and his son\r\nEpiphanus--who died from his debaucheries and was venerated as a\r\ngod[115]--likewise regarded all written laws, Christian or Mosaic, with\r\ncontempt and recognized only the γνῶσις or knowledge given to\r\nthe great men of every nation--Plato and Pythagoras, Moses and\r\nChrist--which \"frees one from all that the vulgar call religion\" and\r\n\"makes man equal to God.\"[116]\r\n\r\nSo in the Carpocratians of the second century we find already the\r\ntendency towards that _deification of humanity_ which forms the supreme\r\ndoctrine of the secret societies and of the visionary Socialists of our\r\nday. The war now begins between the two contending principles: the\r\nChristian conception of man reaching up to God and the secret society\r\nconception of man as God, needing no revelation from on high and no\r\nguidance but the law of his own nature. And since that nature is in\r\nitself divine, all that springs from it is praiseworthy, and those acts\r\nusually regarded as sins are not to be condemned. By this line of\r\nreasoning the Carpocratians arrived at much the same conclusions as\r\nmodern Communists with regard to the ideal social system. Thus\r\nEpiphanus held that since Nature herself reveals the principle of the\r\ncommunity and the unity of all things, human laws which are contrary to\r\nthis law of Nature are so many culpable infractions of the legitimate\r\norder of things. Before these laws were imposed on humanity everything\r\nwas in common--land, goods, and women. According to certain\r\ncontemporaries, the Carpocratians returned to this primitive system by\r\ninstituting the community of women and indulging in every kind of\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\nThe further Gnostic sect of Antitacts, following this same cult of human\r\nnature, taught revolt against all positive religion and laws and the\r\nnecessity for gratifying the flesh; the Adamites of North Africa, going\r\na step further in the return to Nature, cast off all clothing at their\r\nreligious services so as to represent the primitive innocence of the\r\ngarden of Eden--a precedent followed by the Adamites of Germany in the\r\nfifteenth century.[117]\r\n\r\nThese Gnostics, says Eliphas Lévi, under the pretext of \"spiritualizing\r\nmatter, materialized the spirit in the most revolting ways.... Rebels to\r\nthe hierarchic order, ... they wished to substitute the mystical licence\r\nof sensual passions to wise Christian sobriety and obedience to laws....\r\nEnemies of the family, they wished to produce sterility by increasing\r\ndebauchery.\"[118]\r\n\r\nBy way of systematically perverting the doctrines of the Christian faith\r\nthe Gnostics claimed to possess the true versions of the Gospels, and\r\nprofessed belief in these to the exclusion of all the others.[119] Thus\r\nthe Ebionites had their own corrupted version of the Gospel of St.\r\nMatthew founded on the \"Gospel of the Hebrews,\" known earlier to the\r\nJewish Christians; the Marcosians had their version of St. Luke, the\r\nCainites their own \"Gospel of Judas,\" and the Valentinians their \"Gospel\r\nof St. John.\" As we shall see later, the Gospel of St. John is the one\r\nthat throughout the war on Christianity has been specially chosen for\r\nthe purpose of perversion.\r\n\r\nOf course this spirit of perversion was nothing new; many centuries\r\nearlier the prophet Isaiah had denounced it in the words: \"Woe unto them\r\nthat call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and\r\nlight for darkness!\" But the role of the Gnostics was to reduce\r\nperversion to a system by binding men together into sects working under\r\nthe guise of enlightenment in order to obscure all recognized ideas of\r\nmorality and religion. It is this which constitutes their importance in\r\nthe history of secret societies.\r\n\r\nWhether the Gnostics themselves can be described as a secret society, or\r\nrather as a ramification of secret societies, is open to question. M.\r\nMatter, quoting a number of third-century writers, shows the possibility\r\nthat they had mysteries and initiations; the Church Fathers definitely\r\nasserted this to be the case.[120] According to Tertullian, the\r\nValentinians continued, or rather perverted, the mysteries of Eleusis,\r\nout of which they made a \"sanctuary of prostitution.\"[121]\r\n\r\nThe Valentinians are known to have divided their members into three\r\nclasses--the Pneumatics, the Psychics, and the Hylics (i.e.\r\nmaterialists); the Basilideans are also said to have possessed secret\r\ndoctrines known to hardly one in a thousand of the sect. From all this\r\nM. Matter concludes that:\r\n\r\n     1. The Gnostics professed to hold by means of tradition a secret\r\n     doctrine superior to that contained in the public writings of the\r\n     apostles.\r\n\r\n     2. That they did not communicate this doctrine to everyone....\r\n\r\n     3. That they communicated it by means of emblems and symbols, as\r\n     the Diagram of the Ophites proves.\r\n\r\n     4. That in these communications they imitated the rites and trials\r\n     of the mysteries of Eleusis.[122]\r\n\r\nThis claim to the possession of a secret oral tradition, whether known\r\nunder the name of γνῶσις or of Cabala, confirms the conception\r\nof the Gnostics as Cabalists and shows how far they had departed from\r\nChristian teaching. For if only in this idea of \"one doctrine for the\r\nignorant and another for the initiated,\" the Gnostics had restored the\r\nvery system which Christianity had come to destroy.[123]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManicheism\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst we have seen the Gnostic sects working for more or less\r\nsubversive purposes under the guise of esoteric doctrines, we find in\r\nthe Manicheans of Persia, who followed a century later, a sect\r\nembodying the same tendencies and approaching still nearer to secret\r\nsociety organization.\r\n\r\nCubricus or Corbicius, the founder of Manicheism, was born in Babylonia\r\nabout the year A.D. 216. Whilst still a child he is said to have been\r\nbought as a slave by a rich widow of Ctesiphon, who liberated him and on\r\nher death left him great wealth. According to another story--for the\r\nwhole history of Manes rests on legends--he inherited from a rich old\r\nwoman the books of a Saracen named Scythianus on the wisdom of the\r\nEgyptians. Combining the doctrines these books contained with ideas\r\nborrowed from Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, and Christianity, and also\r\nwith certain additions of his own, he elaborated a philosophic system\r\nwhich he proceeded to teach. Cubricus then changed his name to Mani or\r\nManes and proclaimed himself the Paraclete promised by Jesus Christ. His\r\nfollowers were divided into two classes--the outer circle of hearers or\r\ncombatants, and the inner circle of teachers or ascetics described as\r\nthe Elect. As evidence of their resemblance with Freemasons, it has been\r\nsaid that the Manicheans made use of secret signs, grips, and passwords,\r\nthat owing to the circumstances of their master's adoption they called\r\nManes \"the son of the widow\" and themselves \"the children of the widow,\"\r\nbut this is not clearly proved. One of their customs is, however,\r\ninteresting in this connexion. According to legend, Manes undertook to\r\ncure the son of the King of Persia who had fallen ill, but the prince\r\ndied, whereupon Manes was flayed alive by order of the king and his\r\ncorpse hanged up at the city gate. Every year after this, on Good\r\nFriday, the Manicheans carried out a mourning ceremony known as the Bema\r\naround the catafalque of Manes, whose real sufferings they were wont to\r\ncontrast with the unreal sufferings of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental doctrine of Manicheism is Dualism--that is to say, the\r\nexistence of two opposing principles in the world, light and darkness,\r\ngood and evil--founded, however, not on the Christian conception of this\r\nidea, but on the Zoroastrian conception of Ormuzd and Ahriman, and so\r\nperverted and mingled with Cabalistic superstitions that it met with as\r\nvehement denunciation by Persian priests as by Christian Fathers. Thus,\r\naccording to the doctrine of Manes, all matter is absolute evil, the\r\nprinciple of evil is eternal, humanity itself is of Satanic origin, and\r\nthe first human beings, Adam and Eve, are represented as the offspring\r\nof devils.[124] Much the same idea may be found in the Jewish Cabala,\r\nwhere it is said that Adam, after other abominable practices, cohabited\r\nwith female devils whilst Eve consoled herself with male devils, so that\r\nwhole races of demons were born into the world. Eve is also accused of\r\ncohabiting with the Serpent.[125] In the Yalkut Shimoni it is also\r\nrelated that during the 130 years that Adam lived apart from Eve, \"he\r\nbegat a generation of devils, spirits, and hobgoblins.\"[126] Manichean\r\ndemonology thus paved the way for the placation of the powers of\r\ndarkness practised by the Euchites at the end of the fourth century and\r\nlater by the Paulicians, the Bogomils, and the Luciferians.\r\n\r\nSo it is in Gnosticism and Manicheism that we find evidence of the first\r\nattempts to pervert Christianity. The very fact that all such have been\r\ncondemned by the Church as \"heresies\" has tended to enlist sympathy in\r\ntheir favour, yet even Eliphas Lévi recognizes that here the action of\r\nthe Church was right, for the \"monstrous gnosis of Manes\" was a\r\ndesecration not only of Christian doctrines but of pre-Christian sacred\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLT AGAINST ISLAM[127]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have followed the efforts of subversive sects hitherto directed\r\nagainst Christianity and orthodox Judaism; we shall now see this\r\nattempt, reduced by gradual stages to a working system of extraordinary\r\nefficiency, organized for the purpose of undermining all moral and\r\nreligious beliefs in the minds of Moslems. In the middle of the seventh\r\ncentury an immense schism was created in Islam by the rival advocates of\r\nsuccessors to the Prophet, the orthodox Islamites known by the name of\r\nSunnis adhering to the elected Khalifas Abu Bakr, Omar, and Othman,\r\nwhilst the party of revolt, known as the Shiahs, claimed the Khalifate\r\nfor the descendants of Mohammed through Ali, son of Abu-Talib and\r\nhusband of Fatima, the Prophet's daughter. This division ended in open\r\nwarfare; Ali was finally assassinated, his elder son Hason was poisoned\r\nin Medina, his younger son Husain fell at the battle of Kerbela fighting\r\nagainst the supporters of Othman. The deaths of Hasan and Husain are\r\nstill mourned yearly by the Shiahs at the Moharram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ismailis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shiahs themselves split again over the question of Ali's successors\r\ninto four factions, the fourth of which divided again into two further\r\nsects. Both of these retained their allegiance to the descendants of Ali\r\nas far as Jafar-as-Sadik, but whilst one party, known as the Imamias or\r\nIsna-Asharias (i.e. the Twelvers), supported the succession through his\r\nyounger son Musa to the twelfth Iman Mohammed, son of Askeri, the\r\nIsmailis (or Seveners) adhered to Ismail, the elder son of\r\nJafar-as-Sadik.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Choice of SUNNIS\r\n    Abu Bakr (1st Khalifa) 632\r\n    Omar 634\r\n    Othman 644\r\n    Ali\r\n\r\n\r\n    Choice of SHIAHS\r\n\r\n    Abd-ul-Muttalib\r\n      Abdullah\r\n        MOHAMMED A.D. 570-632\r\n          Fatima married Ali\r\n      Abu Tälib\r\n        ALI (4th Sunni and 1st Shiah Khalifa murdered in Kufa)\r\n          (2) Hasan poisoned A.D. 680\r\n          (3) Husain killed at battle of Kerbela A.D. 680\r\n            (4) Ali II\r\n              (5) Mohammed\r\n                (6) Jafar-as-Sadik\r\n                  Choice of ISMAILIS\r\n                   (7) Ismail\r\n                     Mohammed disappeared circ. 770\r\n                  Choice of IMAMIAS or ISNA-ASHARIAS\r\n                    (7) Abu'I Hasan Musa\r\n                      (8) Ali III\r\n                        (9) Abu Jafar Mohammed\r\n                          (10) Ali\r\n                            (11) Abu Mohammed al Askari\r\n                              (12) Mohammed al Mahdi\r\n\r\n    SHIAHS\r\n      ISMAILIS circ.

The earliest Ismailis, who formed themselves\r\ninto a party at about the time of the death of Mohammed, son of Ismail\r\n(i.e. circ. A.D. 770), still remained believers, declaring only that the\r\ntrue teaching of the Prophet had descended to Mohammed, who was not dead\r\nbut would return in the fullness of time and that he was the Mahdi whom\r\nMoslems must await. But in about A.D. 873 an intriguer of extraordinary\r\nsubtlety succeeded in capturing the movement, which, hitherto merely\r\nschismatic, now became definitely subversive, not only of Islamism, but\r\nof all religious belief.\r\n\r\nThis man, Abdullah ibn Maymūn, the son of a learned and free-thinking\r\ndoctor in Southern Persia, brought up in the doctrines of Gnostic\r\nDualism and profoundly versed in all religions, was in reality, like his\r\nfather, a pure materialist. By professing adherence to the creed of\r\northodox Shi-ism, and proclaiming a knowledge of the mystic doctrines\r\nwhich the Ismailis believed to have descended through Ismail to his son\r\nMohammed, Abdullah succeeded in placing himself at the head of the\r\nIsmailis.\r\n\r\nHis advocacy of Ismail was thus merely a mask, his real aim being\r\nmaterialism, which he now proceeded to make into a system by founding a\r\nsect known as the Batinis with seven degrees of initiation. Dozy has\r\ngiven the following description of this amazing project:\r\n\r\n     To link together into one body the vanquished and the conquerors;\r\n     to unite in the form of a vast secret society with many degrees of\r\n     initiation free-thinkers--who regarded religion only as a curb for\r\n     the people--and bigots of all sects; to make tools of believers in\r\n     order to give power to sceptics; to induce conquerors to overturn\r\n     the empires they had founded; to build up a party, numerous,\r\n     compact, and disciplined, which in due time would give the throne,\r\n     if not to himself, at least to his descendants, such was Abdullah\r\n     ibn Maymūn's general aim--an extraordinary conception which he\r\n     worked out with marvellous tact, incomparable skill, and a profound\r\n     knowledge of the human heart. The means which he adopted were\r\n     devised with diabolical cunning....\r\n\r\n     It was ... not among the Shi-ites that he sought his true\r\n     supporters, but among the Ghebers, the Manicheans, the pagans of\r\n     Harran, and the students of Greek philosophy; on the last alone\r\n     could he rely, to them alone could he gradually unfold the final\r\n     mystery, and reveal that Imams, religions, and morality were\r\n     nothing but an imposture and an absurdity. The rest of mankind--the\r\n     \"asses,\" as Abdullah called them--were incapable of understanding\r\n     such doctrines. But to gain his end he by no means disdained their\r\n     aid; on the contrary, he solicited it, but he took care to initiate\r\n     devout and lowly souls only in the first grades of the sect. His\r\n     missionaries, who were inculcated with the idea that their first\r\n     duty was to conceal their true sentiments and adapt themselves to\r\n     the views of their auditors, appeared in many guises, and spoke, as\r\n     it were, in a different language to each class. They won over the\r\n     ignorant vulgar by feats of legerdemain which passed for miracles,\r\n     or excited their curiosity by enigmatical discourse. In the\r\n     presence of the devout they assumed the mask of virtue and piety.\r\n     With mystics they were mystical, and unfolded the inner meanings of\r\n     phenomena, or explained allegories and the figurative sense of the\r\n     allegories themselves....\r\n\r\n     By means such as these the extraordinary result was brought about\r\n     that a multitude of men of diverse beliefs were all working\r\n     together for an object known only to a few of them....[128]\r\n\r\nI quote this passage at length because it is of immense importance in\r\nthrowing a light on the organization of modern secret societies. It does\r\nnot matter what the end may be, whether political, social, or religious,\r\nthe system remains the same--the setting in motion of a vast number of\r\npeople and making them work in a cause unknown to them. That this was\r\nthe method adopted by Weishaupt in organizing the Illuminati and that it\r\ncame to him from the East will be shown later on. We shall now see how\r\nthe system of the philosopher Abdullah paved the way for bloodshed by\r\nthe most terrible sect the world had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Karmathites\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first open acts of violence resulting from the doctrines of Abdullah\r\nwere carried out by the Karmathites, a new development of the Ismailis.\r\nAmongst the many Dais sent out by the leader--which included his son\r\nAhmed and Ahmed's son--was the Dai Hosein Ahwazi, Abdullah's envoy to\r\nIrak in Persia, who initiated a certain Hamdan surnamed Karmath into the\r\nsecrets of the sect. Karmath, who was a born intriguer and believed in\r\nnothing, became the leader of the Karmathites in Arabia, where a number\r\nof Arabs were soon enlisted in the society. With extraordinary skill he\r\nsucceeded in persuading these dupes to make over all their money to him,\r\nfirst by means of small contributions, later by larger sums, until at\r\nlast he convinced them of the advantages of abolishing all private\r\nproperty and establishing the system of the community of goods and\r\nwives. This principle was enforced by the passage of the Koran:\r\n\"Remember the grace of God in that whilst you were enemies, He has\r\nunited your hearts, so that by His grace you have become brothers....\"\r\nDe Sacy thus trans-scribes the methods employed as given by the\r\nhistorian Nowairi:\r\n\r\n     When Karmath had succeeded in establishing all this, and everyone\r\n     had agreed to conform to it, he ordered the Dais to assemble all\r\n     the women on a certain night so that they should mingle\r\n     promiscuously with all the men. This, he said, was perfection and\r\n     the last degree of friendship and fraternal union. Often a husband\r\n     led his wife and presented her himself to one of his brothers when\r\n     that gave him pleasure. When he (Karmath) saw that he had become\r\n     absolute master of their minds, had assured himself of their\r\n     obedience, and found out the degree of their intelligence and\r\n     discernment, he began to lead them quite astray. He put before them\r\n     arguments borrowed from the doctrines of the Dualists. They fell in\r\n     easily with all that he proposed, and then he took away from them\r\n     all religion and released them from all those duties of piety,\r\n     devotion, and the fear of God that he prescribed for them in the\r\n     beginning. He permitted them pillage, and every sort of immoral\r\n     licence, and taught them to throw off the yoke of prayer, fasting,\r\n     and other precepts. He taught them that they were held by no\r\n     obligations, and that they could pillage the goods and shed the\r\n     blood of their adversaries with impunity, that the knowledge of the\r\n     master of truth to whom he had called them took the place of\r\n     everything else, and that with this knowledge they need no longer\r\n     fear sin or punishment.\r\n\r\nAs the result of these teachings the Karmathites rapidly became a band\r\nof brigands, pillaging and massacring all those who opposed them and\r\nspreading terror throughout all the surrounding districts.\r\n\r\nPeaceful fraternity was thus turned into a wild lust for conquest; the\r\nKarmathites succeeded in dominating a great part of Arabia and the mouth\r\nof the Euphrates, and in A.D. 920 extended their ravages westwards. They\r\ntook possession of the holy city of Mecca, in the defence of which\r\n30,000 Moslems fell. \"For a whole century,\" says von Hammer, \"the\r\npernicious doctrines of Karmath raged with fire and sword in the very\r\nbosom of Islamism, until the widespread conflagration was extinguished\r\nin blood.\"\r\n\r\nBut in proclaiming themselves revolutionaries the Karmathites had\r\ndeparted from the plan laid down by the originator of their creed,\r\nAbdullah ibn Maymūn, which had consisted not in acts of open violence\r\nbut in a secret doctrine which should lead to the gradual undermining of\r\nall religious faith and a condition of mental anarchy rather than of\r\nmaterial chaos. For violence, as always, had produced counter-violence,\r\nand it was thus that while the Karmathites were rushing to their own\r\ndestruction through a series of bloody conflicts, another branch of the\r\nIsmailis were quietly reorganizing their forces more in conformity with\r\nthe original method of their founder. These were the Fatimites,\r\nso-called from their professed belief that the doctrine of the Prophet\r\nhad descended from Ali, husband of Fatima, Mohammed's daughter. Whilst\r\nless extreme than the Karmathites, or than their predecessor Abdullah\r\nibn Maymūn, the Fatimites, according to the historian Makrizi,\r\nadopted the method of instilling doubts into the minds of believers and\r\naimed at the substitution of a natural for a revealed religion. Indeed,\r\nafter the establishment of their power in Egypt, it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish any appreciable degree of difference in the character of\r\ntheir teaching from the anarchic code of Abdullah and his more violent\r\nexponent Karmath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fatimites\r\n\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Fatimite dynasty of the Khalifas was one Ubeidallah,\r\nknown as the Mahdi, accused of Jewish ancestry by his adversaries the\r\nAbbasides, who declared--apparently without truth--that he was the son\r\nor grandson of Ahmed, son of Adbullah ibn Maymūn, by a Jewess. Under\r\nthe fourth Fatimite Khalifa Egypt fell into the power of the dynasty,\r\nand, before long, bi-weekly assemblages of both men and women known as\r\n\"societies of wisdom\" were instituted in Cairo. In 1004 these acquired a\r\ngreater importance by the establishment of the Dar ul Hikmat, or the\r\nHouse of Knowledge, by the sixth Khalifa Hakim, who was raised to a\r\ndeity after his death and is worshipped to this day by the Druses. Under\r\nthe direction of the Dar ul Hikmat or Grand Lodge of Cairo, the\r\nFatimites continued the plan of Abdullah ibn Maymūn's secret society\r\nwith the addition of two more degrees, making nine in all. Their method\r\nof enlisting proselytes and system of initiation--which, as Claudio\r\nJannet points out, \"are absolutely those which Weishaupt, the founder of\r\nthe _Illuminati_, prescribed to the 'Insinuating Brothers'\"[129]--were\r\ntranscribed by the fourteenth-century historian Nowairi in a description\r\nthat may be briefly summarized thus[130]:\r\n\r\nThe proselytes were broadly divided into two classes, the learned and\r\nthe ignorant. The Dai was to agree with the former, applauding his\r\nwisdom, and to impress the latter with his own knowledge by asking him\r\nperplexing questions on the Koran. Thus in initiating him into the first\r\ndegree the Dai assumed an air of profundity and explained that religious\r\ndoctrines were too abstruse for the ordinary mind, but must be\r\ninterpreted by men who, like the Dais, had a special knowledge of this\r\nscience. The initiate was bound to absolute secrecy concerning the\r\ntruths to be revealed to him and obliged to pay in advance for these\r\nrevelations. In order to pique his curiosity, the Dai would suddenly\r\nstop short in the middle of a discourse, and should the novice finally\r\ndecline to pay the required sum, he was left in a state of bewilderment\r\nwhich inspired him with the desire to know more.\r\n\r\nIn the second degree the initiate was persuaded that all his former\r\nteachers were wrong and that he must place his confidence solely in\r\nthose Imams endowed with authority from God; in the third he learnt that\r\nthese Imams were those of the Ismailis, seven in number ending with\r\nMohammed, son of Ismail, in contradistinction to the twelve Imams of the\r\nImamias who supported the claims of Ismail's brother Musa; in the fourth\r\nhe was told that the prophets preceding the Imams descending from Ali\r\nwere also seven in number--namely Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, the\r\nfirst Mohammed, and finally Mohammed son of Ismail.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, nothing was said to the initiate in contradiction to the\r\nbroad tenets of orthodox Islamism. But with the fifth degree the process\r\nof undermining his religion began, he was now told to reject tradition\r\nand to disregard the precepts of Mohammed; in the sixth he was taught\r\nthat all religious observances--prayer, fasting, etc.--were only\r\nemblematic, that in fact all these things were devices to keep the\r\ncommon herd of men in subordination; in the seventh the doctrines of\r\nDualism, of a greater and a lesser deity, were introduced and the unity\r\nof God--fundamental doctrine of Islamism--was destroyed; in the eighth a\r\ngreat vagueness was expressed on the attributes of the first and\r\ngreatest of these deities, and it was pointed out that real prophets\r\nwere those who concerned themselves with practical matters--political\r\ninstitutions and good forms of government; finally, in the ninth, the\r\nadept was shown that all religious teaching was allegorical and that\r\nreligious precepts need only be observed in so far as it is necessary to\r\nmaintain order, but the man who understands the truth may disregard all\r\nsuch doctrines. Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and the other prophets were\r\ntherefore only teachers who had profited by the lessons of philosophy.\r\nAll belief in revealed religion was thus destroyed. It will be seen then\r\nthat in the last degrees the whole teaching of the first five was\r\nreversed and therefore shown to be a fraud. Fraud in fact constituted\r\nthe system of the society; in the instructions to the Dais every\r\nartifice is described for enlisting proselytes by misrepresentation:\r\nJews were to be won by speaking ill of Christians, Christians by\r\nspeaking ill of Jews and Moslems alike, Sunnis by referring with respect\r\nto the orthodox Khalifas Abu Bakr and Omar and criticizing Ali and his\r\ndescendants. Above all, care was to be taken not to put before\r\nproselytes doctrines that might revolt them, but to make them advance\r\nstep by step. By these means they would be ready to obey any commands.\r\nAs the instructions express it:\r\n\r\n     If you were to give the order to whoever it might be to take from\r\n     him all that he holds most precious, above all his money, he would\r\n     oppose none of your orders, and if death surprised him he would\r\n     leave you all that he possesses in his will and make you his heir.\r\n     He will think that in the whole world he cannot find a man more\r\n     worthy than you.\r\n\r\nSuch was the great secret society which was to form the model for the\r\nIlluminati of the eighteenth century, to whom the summary of von Hammer\r\nmight with equal truth apply:\r\n\r\n     To believe nothing and to dare all was, in two words, the sum of\r\n     this system, which annihilated every principle of religion and\r\n     morality, and had no other object than to execute ambitious designs\r\n     with suitable ministers, who, daring all and knowing nothing, since\r\n     they consider everything a cheat and nothing forbidden, are the\r\n     best tools of an infernal policy. A system which, with no other aim\r\n     than the gratification of an insatiable lust for domination,\r\n     instead of seeking the highest of human objects, precipitates\r\n     itself into the abyss, and mangling itself, is buried amidst the\r\n     ruins of thrones and altars, the wreck of national happiness, and\r\n     the universal execration of mankind.[131]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Druses\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terrible Grand Lodge of Cairo before long became the centre of a new\r\nand extraordinary cult. Hakim sixth Fatimite Khalifa and founder of the\r\nDar ul Hikmat--a monster of tyranny and crime whose reign can only be\r\ncompared to that of Caligula or Nero--was now raised to the place of a\r\ndivinity by one Ismail Darazi, a Turk who in 1016 announced in a mosque\r\nin Cairo that the Khalifa should be made an object of worship. Hakim,\r\nwho \"believed that divine reason was incarnate in him,\" four years later\r\nproclaimed himself a deity, and the cult was finally established by one\r\nof his viziers, the Persian mystic Hamza ibn Ali. Hakim's cruelties,\r\nhowever, had so outraged the people of Egypt that a year later he was\r\nmurdered by a band of malcontents, led, it is said, by his sister, who\r\nafterwards concealed his body--a circumstance which gave his followers\r\nthe opportunity to declare that the divinity had merely vanished in\r\norder to test the faith of believers, but would reappear in time and\r\npunish apostates. This belief became the doctrine of the Druses of\r\nLebanon, whom Darazi had won over to the worship of Hakim.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enter into the details of this strange religion,\r\nwhich still persists to-day in the range of Lebanon; suffice it to say\r\nthat, although the outcome of the Ismailis, the Druses do not appear to\r\nhave embraced the materialism of Abdullah ibn Maymūn, but to have\r\ngrafted on a primitive form of Nature-worship and of Sabeism the avowed\r\nbelief of the Ismailis in the dynasty of Ali and his successors, and\r\nbeyond this an abstruse, esoteric creed concerning the nature of the\r\nSupreme Deity. God they declare to be \"Universal Reason,\" who manifests\r\nHimself by a series of \"avatars.\" Hakim was the last of the divine\r\nembodiments, and \"when evil and misery have increased to the predestined\r\nheight he will again appear, to conquer the world and to make his\r\nreligion supreme.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, as a secret society that the Druses enter into the scope\r\nof this book, for their organization presents several analogies with\r\nthat which we now know as \"masonic.\" Instead of the nine degrees\r\ninstituted by the Lodge of Cairo, the Druses are divided into only\r\nthree--Profanes, Aspirants, and Wise--to whom their doctrines are\r\ngradually unfolded under seal of the strictest secrecy, to ensure which\r\nsigns and passwords are employed after the manner of Freemasonry. A\r\ncertain degree of duplicity appears to enter into their scheme, much\r\nresembling that enjoined to the Ismaili Dais when enlisting proselytes\r\nbelonging to other religions: thus in talking to Mohammedans, the Druses\r\nprofess to be followers of the Prophet; with Christians, they pretend to\r\nhold the doctrines of Christianity, an attitude they defend on the score\r\nthat it is unlawful to reveal the secret dogmas of their creed to a\r\n\"Black,\" or unbeliever.\r\n\r\nThe Druses are in the habit of holding meetings where, as in the Dar ul\r\nHikmat, both men and women assemble and religious and political\r\nquestions are discussed; the uninitiated, however, are allowed to\r\nexercise no influence on decisions, which are reached by the inner\r\ncircle, to which only the \"Wise\" are admitted. The resemblance between\r\nthis organization and that of Grand Orient Freemasonry is clearly\r\napparent. The Druses also have modes of recognition which are common to\r\nFreemasonry, and M. Achille Laurent has observed: \"The formula or\r\ncatechism of the Druses resembles that of the Freemasons; one can learn\r\nit only from the _Akals_ (or Akels = Intelligent, a small group of\r\nhigher initiates), who only reveal its mysteries after having subjected\r\none to tests and made one take terrible oaths.\"\r\n\r\nI shall refer again later in this book to the affinity between the\r\nDruses and Freemasons of the Grand Orient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Assassins\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Druses, distinguishing themselves from other\r\nIsmaili sects by their worship of Hakim, yet retaining genuine religious\r\nbeliefs, had not carried on the atheistical tradition of Abdullah ibn\r\nMaymūn and of the Grand Lodge of Cairo. But this tradition was to\r\nfind in 1090 an exponent in the Persian Hasan Saba, a native of\r\nKhorasan, the son of Ali, a strict Shiah, who, finding himself suspected\r\nof heretical ideas, ended by declaring himself a Sunni. Hasan, brought\r\nup in this atmosphere of duplicity, was therefore well fitted to play\r\nthe Machiavellian rôle of an Ismaili Dai.\r\n\r\nVon Hammer regards Hasan as a mighty genius, one of a splendid triad,\r\nof which the two others were his schoolfellows the poet Omar Khayyám and\r\nNizam ul Mulk, Grand Vizier under the Seljuk Sultan, Malik Shah. Hasan,\r\nhaving through the protection of Nizam ul Mulk secured titles and\r\nrevenues and finally risen to office at the Court of the Sultan,\r\nattempted to supplant his benefactor and eventually retired in disgrace,\r\nvowing vengeance against the Sultan and vizier. At this juncture he\r\nencountered several Ismailis, one of whom, a Dai named Mumin, finally\r\nconverted him to the principles of his sect, and Hasan, declaring\r\nhimself now to be a convinced adherent of the Fatimite Khalifas, journed\r\nto Cairo, where he was received with honour by the Dar ul Hikmat and\r\nalso by the Khalifa Mustansir, to whom he became counsellor. But his\r\nintrigues once more involving him in disgrace, he fled to Aleppo and\r\nlaid the foundations of his new sect. After enlisting proselytes in\r\nBagdad, Ispahan, Khusistan, and Damaghan, he succeeded in obtaining by\r\nstrategy the fortress of Alamut in Persia on the Caspian Sea, where he\r\ncompleted the plans for his great secret society which was to become for\r\never infamous under the name of the Hashishiyīn, or _Assassins_.\r\n\r\nUnder the pretence of belief in the doctrines of Islam and also of\r\nadherence to the Ismaili line of succession from the Prophet, Hasan Saba\r\nnow set out to pave his way to power, and in order to achieve this end\r\nadopted the same method as Abdullah ibn Maymūn. But the terrible\r\nefficiency of Hasan's society consisted in the fact that a system of\r\nphysical force was now organized in a manner undreamt of by his\r\npredecessor. As von Hammer has observed in an admirable passage:\r\n\r\n     Opinions are powerless, so long as they only confuse the brain,\r\n     without arming the hand. Scepticism and free-thinking, as long as\r\n     they occupied only the minds of the indolent and philosophical,\r\n     have caused the ruin of no throne, for which purpose religious and\r\n     political fanaticism are the strongest levers in the hands of\r\n     nations. It is nothing to the ambitious man what people believe,\r\n     but it is everything to know how he may turn them for the execution\r\n     of his projects.[132]\r\n\r\nThus, as in the case of the French Revolution, \"whose first movers,\" von\r\nHammer also observes, \"were the tools or leaders of secret societies,\"\r\nit was not mere theory but the method of enlisting numerous dupes and\r\nplacing weapons in their hands that brought about the \"Terror\" of the\r\nAssassins six centuries before that of their spiritual descendants, the\r\nJacobins of 1793.\r\n\r\nTaking as his groundwork the organization of the Grand Lodge of Cairo,\r\nHasan reduced the nine degrees to their original number of seven, but\r\nthese now received a definite nomenclature, and included not only real\r\ninitiates but active agents.\r\n\r\nDescending downwards, the degrees of the Assassins were thus as follows:\r\nfirst, the Grand Master, known as the Shaikh-al-Jabal or \"Old Man of the\r\nMountain\"--owing to the fact that the Order always possessed itself of\r\ncastles in mountainous regions; second, the Dail Kebir or Grand Priors;\r\nthird, the fully initiated Dais, religious nuncios and political\r\nemissaries; fourth, the Rafiqs or associates, in training for the higher\r\ndegrees; fifth, the Fadais or \"devoted,\" who undertook to deliver the\r\nsecret blow on which their superiors had decided; sixth, the Lasiqus, or\r\nlaw brothers; and lastly the \"common people,\" who were to be simply\r\nblind instruments. If the equivalents to the words \"Dai,\" \"Rafiqs,\" and\r\n\"Fadais\" given by von Hammer and Dr. Bussell as \"Master Masons,\" \"Fellow\r\nCrafts,\" and \"Entered Apprentices\" are accepted, an interesting analogy\r\nwith the degrees of Freemasonry is provided.\r\n\r\nDesigns against religion were, of course, not admitted by the Order;\r\n\"strict uniformity to Islam was demanded from all the lower rank of\r\nuninitiated, but the _adept_ was taught to see through the deception of\r\n'faith and works.' He believed in nothing and recognized that all acts\r\nor means were indifferent and the (secular) end alone to be\r\nconsidered.\"[133]\r\n\r\nThus the final object was domination by a few men consumed with the lust\r\nof power \"under the cloak of religion and piety,\" and the method by\r\nwhich this was to be established was the wholesale assassination of\r\nthose who opposed them.\r\n\r\nIn order to stimulate the energy of the Fadais, who were required to\r\ncarry out these crimes, the superiors of the Order had recourse to an\r\ningenious system of delusion. Throughout the territory occupied by the\r\nAssassins were exquisite gardens with fruit trees, bowers of roses, and\r\nsparkling streams. Here were arranged luxurious resting-places with\r\nPersian carpets and soft divans, around which hovered black-eyed\r\n\"houris\" bearing wine in gold and silver drinking-vessels, whilst soft\r\nmusic mingled with the murmuring water and the song of birds. The young\r\nman whom the Assassins desired to train for a career of crime was\r\nintroduced to the Grand Master of the Order and intoxicated with\r\nhaschisch--hence the name \"Hashishiyīn\" applied to the sect, from\r\nwhich the word assassin is derived. Under the brief spell of\r\nunconsciousness induced by this seductive drug the prospective Fadai was\r\nthen carried into the garden, where on awaking he believed himself to be\r\nin Paradise. After enjoying all its delights he was given a fresh dose\r\nof the opiate, and, once more unconscious, was transported back to the\r\npresence of the Grand Master, who assured him that he had never left his\r\nside but had merely experienced a foretaste of the Paradise that awaited\r\nhim if he obeyed the orders of his chiefs. The neophyte, thus spurred on\r\nby the belief that he was carrying out the commands of the Prophet, who\r\nwould reward him with eternal bliss, eagerly entered into the schemes\r\nlaid down for him and devoted his life to murder. Thus by the lure of\r\nParadise the Assassins enlisted instruments for their criminal work and\r\nestablished a system of organized murder on a basis of religious\r\nfervour. \"'Nothing is true and all is allowed' was the ground of their\r\nsecret doctrine, which, however, being imparted but to few and concealed\r\nunder the veil of the most austere religionism and piety, restrained the\r\nmind under the yoke of blind obedience.\"[134] To the outside world all\r\nthis remained a profound mystery; fidelity to Islam was proclaimed as\r\nthe fundamental doctrine of the sect, and when the envoy of Sultan Sajar\r\nwas sent to collect information on the religious beliefs of the Order he\r\nwas met with the assurance: \"We believe in the unity of God, and\r\nconsider that only as true wisdom which accords with His word and the\r\ncommands of the prophet.\"\r\n\r\nVon Hammer, answering the possible contention that, as in the case of\r\nthe Templars and the Bavarian Illuminati, these methods of deception\r\nmight be declared a calumny on the Order, points out that in the case of\r\nthe Assassins no possible doubt existed, for their secret doctrines were\r\neventually revealed by the leaders themselves, first by Hasan II, the\r\nthird successor of Hasan Saba, and later by Jalal-ud-din Hasan, who\r\npublicly anathematized the founders of the sect and ordered the burning\r\nof the books that contained their designs against religion--a proceeding\r\nwhich, however, appears to have been a strategical manoeuvre for\r\nrestoring confidence in the Order and enabling him to continue the work\r\nof subversion and crime. A veritable Reign of Terror was thus\r\nestablished throughout the East; the Rafiqs and Fadais \"spread\r\nthemselves in troops over the whole of Asia and darkened the face of the\r\nearth\"; and \"in the annals of the Assassins is found the chronological\r\nenumeration of celebrated men of all nations who have fallen the victims\r\nof the Ismailis, to the joy of their murderers and the sorrow of the\r\nworld.\"[135]\r\n\r\nInevitably this long and systematic indulgence in blood-lust recoiled on\r\nthe heads of the leaders, and the Assassins, like the Terrorists of\r\nFrance, ended by turning on each other. The Old Man of the Mountain\r\nhimself was murdered by his brother-in-law and his son Mohammed;\r\nMohammed, in his turn, whilst \"aiming at the life of his son\r\nJalal-ud-din, was anticipated by him with poison, which murder was again\r\navenged by poison,\" so that from \"Hasan the Illuminator\" down to the\r\nlast of his line the Grand Masters fell by the hands of their\r\nnext-of-kin, and \"poison and the dagger prepared the grave which the\r\nOrder had opened for so many.\"[136] Finally in 1250 the conquering\r\nhordes of the Mongol Mangu Khan swept away the dynasty of the Assassins.\r\n\r\nBut, although as reigning powers the Assassins and Fatimites ceased to\r\nexist, the sects from which they derived have continued up to the\r\npresent day; still every year at the celebration of the Moharram the\r\nShiahs beat their breasts and besprinkle themselves with blood, calling\r\naloud on the martyred heroes Hasan and Husain; the Druses of the Lebanon\r\nstill await the return of Hakim, and in that inscrutable East, the\r\ncradle of all the mysteries, the profoundest European adept of secret\r\nsociety intrigue may find himself outdistanced by pastmasters in the art\r\nin which he believed himself proficient.\r\n\r\nThe sect of Hasan Saba was the supreme model on which all systems of\r\norganized murder working through fanaticism, such as the Carbonari and\r\nthe Irish Republican Brotherhood, were based, and the signs, the\r\nsymbols, the initiations, of the Grand Lodge of Cairo formed the\r\ngroundwork for the great secret societies of Europe.\r\n\r\nHow came this system to be transported to the West? By what channel did\r\nthe ideas of these succeeding Eastern sects penetrate to the Christian\r\nworld? In order to answer this question we must turn to the history of\r\nthe Crusades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1118--nineteen years after the first crusade had ended with\r\nthe defeat of the Moslems, the capture of Antioch and Jerusalem, and the\r\ninstalment of Godefroi de Bouillon as king of the latter city--a band of\r\nnine French _gentilshommes_, led by Hugues de Payens and Godefroi de\r\nSaint-Omer, formed themselves into an Order for the protection of\r\npilgrims to the Holy Sepulchre. Baldwin II, who at this moment succeeded\r\nto the throne of Jerusalem, presented them with a house near the site of\r\nthe Temple of Solomon--hence the name of Knights Templar under which\r\nthey were to become famous. In 1128 the Order was sanctioned by the\r\nCouncil of Troyes and by the Pope, and a rule was drawn up by St.\r\nBernard under which the Knights Templar were bound by the vows of\r\npoverty, chastity, and obedience.\r\n\r\nBut although the Templars distinguished themselves by many deeds of\r\nvalour, the regulation that they were to live solely on alms led to\r\ndonations so enormous that, abandoning their vow of poverty, they spread\r\nthemselves over Europe, and by the end of the twelfth century had become\r\na rich and powerful body. The motto that the Order had inscribed upon\r\nits banner, \"_Non nobis, Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam_,\" was\r\nlikewise forgotten, for, their faith waxing cold, they gave themselves\r\nup to pride and ostentation. Thus, as an eighteenth-century masonic\r\nwriter has expressed it:\r\n\r\n     The war, which for the greater number of warriors of good faith\r\n     proved the source of weariness, of losses and misfortunes, became\r\n     for them (the Templars) only the opportunity for booty and\r\n     aggrandizement, and if they distinguished themselves by a few\r\n     brilliant actions, their motive soon ceased to be a matter of doubt\r\n     when they were seen to enrich themselves even with the spoils of\r\n     the confederates, to increase their credit by the extent of the new\r\n     possessions they had acquired, to carry arrogance to the point of\r\n     rivalling crowned princes in pomp and grandeur, to refuse their aid\r\n     against the enemies of the faith, as the history of Saladin\r\n     testifies, and finally to ally themselves with that horrible and\r\n     sanguinary prince named the Old Man of the Mountain, Prince of the\r\n     Assassins.[137]\r\n\r\nThe truth of the last accusation is, however, open to question. For a\r\ntime, at any rate, the Templars had been at war with the Assassins. When\r\nin 1152 the Assassins murdered Raymond, Comte de Tripoli, the Templars\r\nentered their territory and forced them to sign a treaty by which they\r\nwere to pay a yearly tribute of 12,000 gold pieces in expiation of the\r\ncrime. Some years later the Old Man of the Mountain sent an ambassador\r\nto Amaury, King of Jerusalem, to tell him privately that if the Templars\r\nwould forgo the payment of this tribute he and his followers would\r\nembrace the Christian faith. Amaury accepted, offering at the same time\r\nto compensate the Templars, but some of the Knights assassinated the\r\nambassador before he could return to his master. When asked for\r\nreparations the Grand Master threw the blame on an evil one-eyed Knight\r\nnamed Gautier de Maisnil.[138]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the relations between the Templars and\r\nthe Assassins were at first far from amicable; nevertheless, it appears\r\nprobable that later on an understanding was brought about between them.\r\nBoth on this charge and on that of treachery towards the Christian\r\narmies, Dr. Bussell's impartial view of the question may be quoted:\r\n\r\n     When in 1149 the Emperor Conrad III failed before Damascus, the\r\n     Templars were believed to have a secret understanding with the\r\n     garrison of that city; ... in 1154 they were said to have sold, for\r\n     60,000 gold pieces, a prince of Egypt who had wished to become a\r\n     Christian; he was taken home to suffer certain death at the hands\r\n     of his fanatical family. In 1166 Amaury, King of Jerusalem, hanged\r\n     twelve members of the Order for betraying a fortress to Nureddin.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Bussell goes on to say that it cannot be disputed that they had\r\n\"long and important dealings\" with the Assassins \"and were therefore\r\nsuspected (not unfairly) of imbibing their precepts and following their\r\nprinciples.\"[139]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the thirteenth century the Templars had become suspect,\r\nnot only in the eyes of the clergy, but of the general public. \"Amongst\r\nthe common people,\" one of their latest apologists admits, \"vague\r\nrumours circulated. They talked of the covetousness and want of scruple\r\nof the Knights, of their passion for aggrandizement and their rapacity.\r\nTheir haughty insolence was proverbial. Drinking habits were attributed\r\nto them; the saying was already in use 'to drink like a Templar.' The\r\nold German word _Tempelhaus_ indicated a house of ill-fame.\"[140]\r\n\r\nThe same rumours had reached Clement V even before his accession to the\r\npapal throne in 1305,[141] and in this same year he summoned the Grand\r\nMaster of the Order, Jacques du Molay, to return to France from the\r\nisland of Cyprus, where he was assembling fresh forces to avenge the\r\nrecent reverses of the Christian armies.\r\n\r\nDu Molay arrived in France with sixty other Knights Templar and 150,000\r\ngold florins, as well as a large quantity of silver that the Order had\r\namassed in the East.[142]\r\n\r\nThe Pope now set himself to make enquiries concerning the charges of\r\n\"unspeakable apostasy against God, detestable idolatry, execrable vice,\r\nand many heresies\" that had been \"secretly intimated\" to him. But, to\r\nquote his own words:\r\n\r\n     Because it did not seem likely nor credible that men of such\r\n     religion who were believed often to shed their blood and frequently\r\n     expose their persons to the peril of death for Christ's name, and\r\n     who showed such great and many signs of devotion both in divine\r\n     offices as well as in fasts, as in other devotional observances,\r\n     should be so forgetful of their salvation as to do these things, we\r\n     were unwilling ... to give ear to this kind of insinuation ...\r\n     (_hujusmodi insinuacioni ac delacioni ipsorum ... aurem noluimus\r\n     inclinare_).[143]\r\n\r\nThe King of France, Philippe le Bel, who had hitherto been the friend of\r\nthe Templars, now became alarmed and urged the Pope to take action\r\nagainst them; but before the Pope was able to find out more about the\r\nmatter, the King took the law into his own hands and had all the\r\nTemplars in France arrested on October 13, 1307. The following charges\r\nwere then brought against them by the Inquisitor for France before whom\r\nthey were examined:\r\n\r\n     1. The ceremony of initiation into their Order was accompanied by\r\n        insults to the Cross, the denial of Christ, and gross obscenities.\r\n\r\n     2. The adoration of an idol which was said to be the image of the\r\n        true God.\r\n\r\n     3. The omission of the words of consecration at Mass.\r\n\r\n     4. The right that the lay chiefs arrogated to themselves of giving\r\n        absolution.\r\n\r\n     5. The authorization of unnatural vice.\r\n\r\nTo all these infamies a great number of the Knights, including Jacques\r\ndu Molay, confessed in almost precisely the same terms; at their\r\nadmission into the Order, they said, they had been shown the cross on\r\nwhich was the figure of Christ, and had been asked whether they believed\r\nin Him; when they answered yes, they were told in some cases that this\r\nwas wrong (_dixit sibi quod male credebat_),[144] because He was not\r\nGod, He was a false prophet (_quia falsus propheta erat, nec erat\r\nDeus_).[145] Some added that they were then shown an idol or a bearded\r\nhead which they were told to worship[146]; one added that this was of\r\nsuch \"a terrible aspect that it seemed to him to be the face of some\r\ndevil, called in French _un maufé_, and that whenever he saw it he was\r\nso overcome with fear that he could hardly look at it without fear and\r\ntrembling.\"[147] All who confessed declared that they had been ordered\r\nto spit on the crucifix, and very many that they had received the\r\ninjunction to commit obscenities and to practise unnatural vice. Some\r\nsaid that on their refusal to carry out these orders they had been\r\nthreatened with imprisonment, even perpetual imprisonment; a few said\r\nthey had actually been incarcerated[148]; one declared that he had been\r\nterrorized, seized by the throat, and threatened with death.[149]\r\n\r\nSince, however, a number of these confessions were made under torture,\r\nit is more important to consider the evidence provided by the trial of\r\nthe Knights at the hands of the Pope, where this method was not\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nNow, at the time the Templars were arrested, Clement V., deeply\r\nresenting the King's interference with an Order which existed entirely\r\nunder papal jurisdiction, wrote in the strongest terms of remonstrance\r\nto Philippe le Bel urging their release, and even after their trial,\r\nneither the confessions of the Knights nor the angry expostulations of\r\nthe King could persuade him to believe in their guilt.[150] But as the\r\nscandal concerning the Templars was increasing, he consented to receive\r\nin private audience \"a certain Knight of the Order, of great nobility\r\nand held by the said Order in no slight esteem,\" who testified to the\r\nabominations that took place on the reception of the Brethren, the\r\nspitting on the cross, and other things which were not lawful nor,\r\nhumanly speaking, decent.[151]\r\n\r\nThe Pope then decided to hold an examination of seventy-two French\r\nKnights at Poictiers in order to discover whether the confessions made\r\nby them before the Inquisitor at Paris could be substantiated, and at\r\nthis examination, conducted without torture or pressure of any kind in\r\nthe presence of the Pope himself, the witnesses declared on oath that\r\nthey would tell \"the full and pure truth.\" They then made confessions\r\nwhich were committed to writing in their presence, and these being\r\nafterwards read aloud to them, they expressly and willingly approved\r\nthem (_perseverantes in illis eas expresse et sponte, prout recitate\r\nfuerunt approbarunt_).[152]\r\n\r\nBesides this, an examination of the Grand Master, Jacques du Molay, and\r\nthe Preceptors of the Order was held in the presence of \"three Cardinals\r\nand four public notaries and many other good men.\" These witnesses, says\r\nthe official report, \"having sworn with their hands on the Gospel of\r\nGod\" (_ad sancta dei evangelia ab iis corporaliter tacta_) that--\r\n\r\n     they would on all the aforesaid things speak the pure and full\r\n     truth, they, separately, freely, and spontaneously, without any\r\n     coercion and fear, deposed and confessed among other things, the\r\n     denial of Christ and spitting upon the cross when they were\r\n     received into the Order of the Temple. And some of them (deposed\r\n     and confessed) that under the same form, namely, with denial of\r\n     Christ and spitting on the cross, they had received many Brothers\r\n     into the Order. Some of them too confessed certain other horrible\r\n     and disgusting things on which we are silent.... Besides this, they\r\n     said and confessed that those things which are contained in the\r\n     confessions and depositions of heretical depravity which they made\r\n     lately before the Inquisitor (of Paris) were true.\r\n\r\nTheir confessions, being again committed to writing, were approved by\r\nthe witnesses, who then with bended knees and many tears asked for and\r\nobtained absolution.[153]\r\n\r\nThe Pope, however, still refused to take action against the whole Order\r\nmerely because the Master and Brethren around him had \"gravely sinned,\"\r\nand it was decided to hold a papal commission in Paris. The first\r\nsitting took place in November 1309, when the Grand Master and 231\r\nKnights were summoned before the pontifical commissioners. \"This\r\nenquiry,\" says Michelet, \"was conducted slowly, with much consideration\r\nand gentleness (_avec beaucoup de ménagement et de douceur_) by high\r\necclesiastical dignitaries, an archbishop, several bishops, etc.\"[154]\r\nBut although a number of the Knights, including the Grand Master, now\r\nretracted their admissions, some damning confessions were again\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the scope of this book to follow the many trials\r\nof the Templars that took place in different countries--in Italy, at\r\nRavenna, Pisa, Bologna, and Florence, where torture was not employed and\r\nblasphemies were admitted,[155] or in Germany, where torture was\r\nemployed but no confessions were made and a verdict was given in favour\r\nof the Order. A few details concerning the trial in England may,\r\nhowever, be of interest.\r\n\r\nIt has generally been held that torture was not applied in England owing\r\nto the humanity of Edward II, who at first absolutely refused to listen\r\nto any accusations against the Order.[156] On December 10, 1307, he had\r\nwritten to the Pope in these terms:\r\n\r\n     And because the said Master or Brethren constant in the purity of\r\n     the Catholic faith have been frequently commended by us, and by all\r\n     our kingdom, both in their life and morals, we are unable to\r\n     believe in suspicious stories of this kind until we know with\r\n     greater certainty about these things.\r\n\r\n     We, therefore, pity from our souls the suffering and losses of the\r\n     Sd. Master and brethren, which they suffer in consequence of such\r\n     infamy, and we supplicate most affectionately your Sanctity if it\r\n     please you, that considering with favour suited to the good\r\n     character of the Master and brethren, you may deem fit to meet with\r\n     more indulgence the detractions, calumnies and charges by certain\r\n     envious and evil disposed persons, who endeavour to turn their good\r\n     deeds into works of perverseness opposed to divine teaching; until\r\n     the said charges attributed to them shall have been brought legally\r\n     before you or your representatives here and more fully proved.[157]\r\n\r\nEdward II also wrote in the same terms to the Kings of Portugal,\r\nCastile, Aragon, and Sicily. But two years later, after Clement V had\r\nhimself heard the confessions of the Order, and a Papal Bull had been\r\nissued declaring that \"the unspeakable wickednesses and abominable\r\ncrimes of notorious heresy\" had now \"come to the knowledge of almost\r\neveryone,\" Edward II was persuaded to arrest the Templars and order\r\ntheir examination. According to Mr. Castle, whose interesting treatise\r\nwe quote here, the King would not allow torture to be employed, with the\r\nresult that the Knights denied all charges; but later, it is said, he\r\nallowed himself to be overpersuaded, and \"torture appears to have been\r\napplied on one or two occasions,\"[158] with the result that three\r\nKnights confessed to all and were given absolution.[159] At Southwark,\r\nhowever, \"a considerable number of brethren\" admitted that \"they had\r\nbeen strongly accused of the crimes of negation and spitting, they did\r\nnot say they were guilty but that they could not purge themselves ...\r\nand therefore they abjured these and all other heresies.\"[160] Evidence\r\nwas also given against the Order by outside witnesses, and the same\r\nstories of intimidation at the ceremony of reception were told.[161] At\r\nany rate, the result of the investigation was not altogether\r\nsatisfactory, and the Templars were finally suppressed in England as\r\nelsewhere by the Council of Vienne in 1312.\r\n\r\nIn France more rigorous measures were adopted and fifty-four Knights who\r\nhad retracted their confessions were burnt at the stake as \"relapsed\r\nheretics\" on May 12, 1310. Four years later, on March 14, 1314, the\r\nGrand Master, Jacques du Molay, suffered the same fate.\r\n\r\nNow, however much we must execrate the barbarity of this sentence--as\r\nalso the cruelties that had preceded it--- this is no reason why we\r\nshould admit the claim of the Order to noble martyrdom put forward by\r\nthe historians who have espoused their cause. The character of the\r\nTemplars is not rehabilitated by condemning the conduct of the King and\r\nPope. Yet this is the line of argument usually adopted by the defenders\r\nof the Order. Thus the two main contentions on which they base their\r\ndefence are, firstly, that the confessions of the Knights were made\r\nunder torture, therefore they must be regarded as null and void; and,\r\nsecondly, that the whole affair was a plot concerted between the King\r\nand Pope in order to obtain possession of the Templars' riches. Let us\r\nexamine these contentions in turn.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as we have seen, all confessions were not made under\r\ntorture. No one, as far as I am aware, disputes Michelet's assertion\r\nthat the enquiry before the Papal Commission in Paris, at which a number\r\nof Knights adhered to the statements they had made to the Pope, was\r\nconducted without pressure of any kind. But further, the fact that\r\nconfessions are made under torture does not necessarily invalidate them\r\nas evidence. Guy Fawkes also confessed under torture, yet it is never\r\nsuggested that the whole story of the Gunpowder Plot was a myth.\r\nTorture, however much we may condemn it, has frequently proved the only\r\nmethod for overcoming the intimidation exercised over the mind of a\r\nconspirator; a man bound by the terrible obligations of a confederacy\r\nand fearing the vengeance of his fellow-conspirators will not readily\r\nyield to persuasion, but only to force. If, then, some of the Templars\r\nwere terrorized by torture, or even by the fear of torture, it must not\r\nbe forgotten that terrorism was exercised by both sides. Few will deny\r\nthat the Knights were bound by oaths of secrecy, so that on one hand\r\nthey were threatened with the vengeance of the Order if they betrayed\r\nits secrets, and on the other faced with torture if they refused to\r\nconfess. Thus they found themselves between the devil and the deep sea.\r\nIt was therefore not a case of a mild and unoffending Order meeting\r\nwith brutal treatment at the hands of authority, but of the victims of a\r\nterrible autocracy being delivered into the hands of another autocracy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, do the confessions of the Knights appear to be the outcome of\r\npure imagination such as men under the influence of torture might\r\ndevise? It is certainly difficult to believe that the accounts of the\r\nceremony of initiation given in detail by men in different countries,\r\nall closely resembling each other, yet related in different phraseology,\r\ncould be pure inventions. Had the victims been driven to invent they\r\nwould surely have contradicted each other, have cried out in their agony\r\nthat all kinds of wild and fantastic rites had taken place in order to\r\nsatisfy the demands of their interlocutors. But no, each appears to be\r\ndescribing the same ceremony more or less completely, with\r\ncharacteristic touches that indicate the personality of the speaker, and\r\nin the main all the stories tally.\r\n\r\nThe further contention that the case against the Templars was\r\nmanufactured by the King and Pope with a view to obtaining their wealth\r\nis entirely disproved by facts. The latest French historian of mediæval\r\nFrance, whilst expressing disbelief in the guilt of the Templars,\r\ncharacterizes this counter-accusation as \"puerile.\" \"Philippe le Bel,\"\r\nwrites M. Funck-Brentano, \"has never been understood; from the beginning\r\npeople have not been just to him. This young prince was one of the\r\ngreatest kings and the noblest characters that have appeared in\r\nhistory.\"[162]\r\n\r\nWithout carrying appreciation so far, one must nevertheless accord to M.\r\nFunck-Brentano's statement of facts the attention it merits. Philippe\r\nhas been blamed for debasing the coin of the realm; in reality he merely\r\nordered it to be mixed with alloy as a necessary measure after the war\r\nwith England,[163] precisely as own coinage was debased in consequence\r\nof the recent war. This was done quite openly and the coinage was\r\nrestored at the earliest opportunity. Intensely national, his policy of\r\nattacking the Lombards, exiling the Jews, and suppressing the Templars,\r\nhowever regrettable the methods by which it was carried out, resulted in\r\nimmense benefits to France; M. Funck-Brentano has graphically described\r\nthe prosperity of the whole country during the early fourteenth\r\ncentury--the increase of population, flourishing agriculture and\r\nindustry. \"In Provence and Languedoc one meets swineherds who have\r\nvineyards; simple cowherds who have town houses.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Philippe le Bel towards the Templars must be viewed in\r\nthis light--ruthless suppression of any body of people who interfered\r\nwith the prosperity of France. His action was not that of arbitrary\r\nauthority; he \"proceeded,\" says M. Funck-Brentano, \"by means of an\r\nappeal to the people. In his name Nogaret (the Chancellor) spoke to the\r\nParisians in the garden of the Palace (October 13, 1307). Popular\r\nassemblies were convoked all over France\";[165] \"the Parliament of\r\nTours, with hardly a dissentient vote, declared the Templars worthy of\r\ndeath. The University of Paris gave the weight of their judgement as to\r\nthe fullness and authenticity of the confessions.\"[166] Even assuming\r\nthat these bodies were actuated by the same servility as that which has\r\nbeen attributed to the Pope, how are we to explain the fact that the\r\ntrial of the Order aroused no opposition among the far from docile\r\npeople of Paris? If the Templars had indeed, as they professed, been\r\nleading noble and upright lives, devoting themselves to the care of the\r\npoor, one might surely expect their arrest to be followed by popular\r\nrisings. But there appears to have been no sign of this.\r\n\r\nAs to the Pope, we have already seen that from the outset he had shown\r\nhimself extremely reluctant to condemn the Order, and no satisfactory\r\nexplanation is given of his change of attitude except that he wished to\r\nplease the King. As far as his own interests were concerned, it is\r\nobvious that he could have nothing to gain by publishing to the world a\r\nscandal that must inevitably bring opprobrium on the Church. His\r\nlamentations to this effect in the famous Bull[167] clearly show that he\r\nrecognized this danger and therefore desired at all costs to clear the\r\naccused Knights, if evidence could be obtained in their favour. It was\r\nonly when the Templars made damning admissions in his presence that he\r\nwas obliged to abandon their defence.[168] Yet we are told that he did\r\nthis out of base compliance with the wishes of Philippe le Bel.\r\n\r\nPhilippe le Bell is thus represented as the arch-villain of the whole\r\npiece, through seven long years hounding down a blameless Order--from\r\nwhom up to the very moment of their arrest he had repeatedly received\r\nloans of money--solely with the object of appropriating their wealth.\r\nYet after all we find that the property of the Templars was not\r\nappropriated by the King, but was given by him to the Knights of St.\r\nJohn of Jerusalem!\r\n\r\n     What was the fate of the Templars' goods? Philippe le Bel decided\r\n     that they should be handed over to the Hospitallers. Clement V\r\n     states that the Orders given by the King on this subject were\r\n     executed. Even the domain of the Temple in Paris ... up to the eve\r\n     of the Revolution was the property of the Knights of St. John of\r\n     Jerusalem. The royal treasury kept for itself certain sums for the\r\n     costs of the trial. These had been immense.[169]\r\n\r\nThese facts in no way daunt the antagonists of Philippe, who we are now\r\nassured--again without any proof whatever--was overruled by the Pope in\r\nthis matter. But setting all morality aside, as a mere question of\r\npolicy, is it likely that the King would have deprived himself of his\r\nmost valuable financial supporters and gone to the immense trouble of\r\nbringing them to trial without first assuring himself that he would\r\nbenefit by the affair? Would he, in other words, have killed the goose\r\nthat laid the golden eggs without any guarantee that the body of the\r\ngoose would remain in his possession? Again, if, as we are told, the\r\nPope suppressed the Order so as to please the King, why should he have\r\nthwarted him over the whole purpose the King had in view? Might we not\r\nexpect indignant remonstrances from Philippe at thus being baulked of\r\nthe booty he had toiled so long to gain? But, on the contrary, we find\r\nhim completely in agreement with the Pope on this subject. In November\r\n1309 Clement V distinctly stated that \"Philippe the Illustrious, King of\r\nFrance,\" to whom the facts concerning the Templars had been told, was\r\n\"not prompted by avarice since he desired to keep or appropriate for\r\nhimself no part of the property of the Templars, but liberally and\r\ndevotedly left them to us and the Church to be administered,\" etc.[170]\r\n\r\nThus the whole theory concerning the object for which the Templars were\r\nsuppressed falls to the ground--a theory which on examination is seen to\r\nbe built up entirely on the plan of imputing motives without any\r\njustification in facts. The King acted from cupidity, the Pope from\r\nservility, and the Templars confessed from fear of torture--on these\r\npure hypotheses defenders of the Order base their arguments.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, far more probably, that if the King had any additional\r\nreason for suppressing the Templars it was not envy of their wealth but\r\nfear of the immense power their wealth conferred; the Order dared even\r\nto defy the King and to refuse to pay taxes. The Temple in fact\r\nconstituted an _imperium in imperio_ that threatened not only the royal\r\nauthority but the whole social system.[171] An important light is thrown\r\non the situation by M. Funck-Brentano in this passage:\r\n\r\n     As the Templars had houses in all countries, they practised the\r\n     financial operations of the international banks of our times; they\r\n     were acquainted with letters of change, orders payable at sight,\r\n     they instituted dividends and annuities on deposited capital,\r\n     advanced funds, lent on credit, controlled private accounts,\r\n     undertook to raise taxes for the lay and ecclesiastical\r\n     seigneurs.[172]\r\n\r\nThrough their proficiency in these matters--acquired very possibly from\r\nthe Jews of Alexandria whom they must have met in the East--the Templars\r\nhad become the \"international financiers\" and \"international\r\ncapitalists\" of their day; had they not been suppressed, all the evils\r\nnow denounced by Socialists as peculiar to the system they describe as\r\n\"Capitalism\"--trusts, monopolies, and \"corners\"--would in all\r\nprobability have been inaugurated during the course of the fourteenth\r\ncentury in a far worse form than at the present day, since no\r\nlegislation existed to protect the community at large. The feudal\r\nsystem, as Marx and Engels perceived, was the principal obstacle to\r\nexploitation by a financial autocracy.[173]\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is by no means improbable that this order of things would\r\nhave been brought about by the violent overthrow of the French\r\nmonarchy--indeed, of all monarchies; the Templars, \"those terrible\r\nconspirators,\" says Eliphas Lévi, \"threatened the whole world with an\r\nimmense revolution.\"[174]\r\n\r\nHere perhaps we may find the reason why this band of dissolute and\r\nrapacious nobles has enlisted the passionate sympathy of democratic\r\nwriters. For it will be noticed that these same writers who attribute\r\nthe King's condemnation of the Order to envy of their wealth never apply\r\nthis argument to the demagogues of the eighteenth century and suggest\r\nthat their accusations against the nobles of France were inspired by\r\ncupidity, nor would they ever admit that any such motive may enter into\r\nthe diatribes against private owners of wealth to-day. The Templars thus\r\nremain the only body of capitalists, with the exception of the Jews, to\r\nbe not only pardoned for their riches but exalted as noble victims of\r\nprejudice and envy. Is it merely because the Templars were the enemies\r\nof monarchy? Or is it that the world revolution, whilst attacking\r\nprivate owners of property, has never been opposed to International\r\nFinance, particularly when combined with anti-Christian tendencies?\r\n\r\nIt is the continued defence of the Templars which, to the present\r\nwriter, appears the most convincing evidence against them. For even if\r\none believes them innocent of the crimes laid to their charge, how is it\r\npossible to admire them in their later stages? The fact that cannot be\r\ndenied is that they were false to their obligations; that they took the\r\nvow of poverty and then grew not only rich but arrogant; that they took\r\nthe vow of chastity and became notoriously immoral.[175] Are all these\r\nthings then condoned because the Templars formed a link in the chain of\r\nworld revolution?\r\n\r\nAt this distance of time the guilt or innocence of the Templars will\r\nprobably never be conclusively established either way; on the mass of\r\nconflicting evidence bequeathed to us by history no one can pronounce a\r\nfinal judgement.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to digmatize on the question, I would suggest that\r\nthe real truth may be that the Knights were both innocent and guilty,\r\nthat is to say, that a certain number were initiated into the secret\r\ndoctrine of the Order whilst the majority remained throughout in\r\nignorance. Thus according to the evidence of Stephen de Stapelbrugge, an\r\nEnglish Knight, \"there were two modes of reception, one lawful and good\r\nand the other contrary to the Faith.\"[176] This would account for the\r\nfact that some of the accused declined to confess even under the\r\ngreatest pressure. These may really have known nothing of the real\r\ndoctrines of the Order, which were confided orally only to those whom\r\nthe superiors regarded as unlikely to be revolted by them. Such have\r\nalways been the methods of secret societies, from the Ismailis onward.\r\n\r\nThis theory of a double doctrine is put forward by Loiseleur, who\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n     If we consult the statutes of the Order of the Temple as they have\r\n     come down to us, we shall certainly discover there is nothing that\r\n     justifies the strange and abominable practices revealed at the\r\n     Inquiry. But ... besides the public rule, had not the Order another\r\n     one, whether traditional or written, authorizing or even\r\n     prescribing these practices--a secret rule, revealed only to the\r\n     initiates?[177]\r\n\r\nEliphas Lévi also exonerates the majority of the Templars from\r\ncomplicity in either anti-monarchical or anti-religious designs:\r\n\r\n     These tendencies were enveloped in profound mystery and the Order\r\n     made an outward profession of the most perfect orthodoxy. The\r\n     Chiefs alone knew whither they were going; the rest followed\r\n     unsuspectingly.[178]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the Templar heresy? On this point we find a variety of\r\nopinions. According to Wilcke, Ranke, and Weber it was \"the unitarian\r\ndeism of Islam\"[179]; Lecouteulx de Canteleu thinks, however, it was\r\nderived from heretical Islamic sources, and relates that whilst in\r\nPalestine, one of the Knights, Guillaume de Montbard, was initiated by\r\nthe Old Man of the Mountain in a cave of Mount Lebanon.[180] That a\r\ncertain resemblance existed between the Templars and the Assassins has\r\nbeen indicated by von Hammer,[181] and further emphasized by the\r\nFreemason Clavel:\r\n\r\n     Oriental historians show us, at different periods, the Order of the\r\n     Templars maintaining intimate relations with that of the Assassins,\r\n     and they insist on the affinity that existed between the two\r\n     associations. They remark that they had adopted the same colours,\r\n     white and red; that they had the same organization, the same\r\n     hierarchy of degrees, those of fedavi, refik, and dai in one\r\n     corresponding to those of novice, professed, and knight in the\r\n     other; that both conspired for the ruin of the religions they\r\n     professed in public, and that finally both possessed numerous\r\n     castles, the former in Asia, the latter in Europe.[182]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these outward resemblances it does not appear from the\r\nconfessions of the Knights that the secret doctrine of the Templars was\r\nthat of the Assassins or of any Ismaili sect by which, in accordance\r\nwith orthodox Islamism, Jesus was openly held up as a prophet, although,\r\nsecretly, indifference to all religion was inculcated. The Templars, as\r\nfar as can be discovered, were anti-Christian deists; Loiseleur\r\nconsiders that their ideas were derived from Gnostic or Manichean\r\ndualists--Cathari, Paulicians, or more particularly Bogomils, of which a\r\nbrief account must be given here.\r\n\r\nThe _Paulicians_, who flourished about the seventh century A.D., bore a\r\nresemblance to the Cainites and Ophites in their detestation of the\r\nDemiurgus and in the corruption of their morals. Later, in the ninth\r\ncentury, the _Bogomils_, whose name signifies in Slavonic \"friends of\r\nGod\" and who had migrated from Northern Syria and Mesopotamia to the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, particularly Thrace, appeared as a further development\r\nof Manichean dualism. Their doctrine may be summarized thus:\r\n\r\nGod, the Supreme Father, has two sons, the elder Satanael, the younger\r\nJesus. To Satanael, who sat on the right hand of God, belonged the right\r\nof governing the celestial world, but, filled with pride, he rebelled\r\nagainst his Father and fell from Heaven. Then, aided by the companions\r\nof his fall, he created the visible world, image of the celestial,\r\nhaving like the other its sun, moon, and stars, and last he created man\r\nand the serpent which became his minister. Later Christ came to earth in\r\norder to show men the way to Heaven, but His death was ineffectual, for\r\neven by descending into Hell He could not wrest the power from Satanael,\r\ni.e. Satan.\r\n\r\nThis belief in the impotence of Christ and the necessity therefore for\r\nplacating Satan, not only \"the Prince of this world,\" but its creator,\r\nled to the further doctrine that Satan, being all-powerful, should be\r\nadored. Nicetas Choniates, a Byzantine historian of the twelfth century,\r\ndescribed the followers of this cult as \"Satanists,\" because\r\n\"considering Satan powerful they worshipped him lest he might do them\r\nharm\"; subsequently they were known as Luciferians, their doctrine (as\r\nstated by Neuss and Vitoduranus) being that Lucifer was unjustly driven\r\nout of Heaven, that one day he will ascend there again and be restored\r\nto his former glory and power in the celestial world.\r\n\r\nThe Bogomils and Luciferians were thus closely akin, but whilst the\r\nformer divided their worship between God and His two sons, the latter\r\nworshipped Lucifer only, regarding the material world as his work and\r\nholding that by indulging the flesh they were propitiating their\r\nDemon-Creator. It was said that a black cat, the symbol of Satan,\r\nfigured in their ceremonies as an object of worship, also that at their\r\nhorrible nocturnal orgies sacrifices of children were made and their\r\nblood used for making the Eucharistic bread of the sect.[183]\r\n\r\n     Thus the Templars recognize at the same time a good god,\r\n     incommunicable to man and consequently without symbolic\r\n     representation, and a bad god, to whom they give the features of an\r\n     idol of fearful aspect.[184]\r\n\r\nTheir most fervent worship was addressed to this god of evil, who alone\r\ncould enrich them. \"They said with the Luciferians: 'The elder son of\r\nGod, Satanael or Lucifer alone has a right to the homage of mortals;\r\nJesus his younger brother does not deserve this honour.'\"[185]\r\n\r\nAlthough we shall not find these ideas so clearly defined in the\r\nconfessions of the Knights, some colour is lent to this theory by those\r\nwho related that the reason given to them for not believing in Christ\r\nwas \"that He was nothing, He was a false prophet and of no value, and\r\nthat they should believe in the Higher God of Heaven who could save\r\nthem.\"[186] According to Loiseleur, the idol they were taught to\r\nworship, the bearded head known to history as Baphomet, represented \"the\r\ninferior god, organizer and dominator of the material world, author of\r\ngood and evil here below, him by whom evil was introduced into\r\ncreation.\"[187]\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the word Baphomet is difficult to discover; Raynouard\r\nsays it originated with two witnesses heard at Carcassonne who spoke of\r\n\"Figura Baflometi,\" and suggests that it was a corruption of \"Mohammed,\"\r\nwhom the Inquisitors wished to make the Knights confess they were taught\r\nto adore.[188] But this surmise with regard to the intentions of the\r\nInquisitors seems highly improbable, since they must have been well\r\naware that, as Wilcke points out, the Moslems forbid all idols.[189] For\r\nthis reason Wilcke concludes that the Mohammedanism of the Templars was\r\ncombined with Cabalism and that their idol was in reality the\r\n_macroprosopos_, or head of the Ancient of Ancients, represented as an\r\nold man with a long beard, or sometimes as three heads in one, which has\r\nalready been referred to under the name of the Long Face in the first\r\nchapter of this book--a theory which would agree with Eliphas Lévi's\r\nassertion that the Templars were \"initiated into the mysterious\r\ndoctrines of the Cabala.\"[190] But Lévi goes on to define this teaching\r\nunder the name of Johannism. It is here that we reach a further theory\r\nwith regard to the secret doctrine of the Templars--- the most important\r\nof all, since it emanates from masonic and neo-Templar sources thus\r\neffectually disposing of the contention that the charge brought against\r\nthe Order of apostasy from the Catholic faith is solely the invention of\r\nCatholic writers.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the Freemason Ragon related that the Templars learnt from the\r\n\"initiates of the East\" a certain Judaic doctrine which was attributed\r\nto St. John the Apostle; therefore \"they renounced the religion of St.\r\nPeter\" and became Johannites.[191] Eliphas Lévi expresses the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nNow, these statements are apparently founded on a legend which was first\r\npublished early in the nineteenth century, when an association calling\r\nitself the _Ordre du Temple_ and claiming direct descent from the\r\noriginal Templar Order published two works, the _Manuel des Chevaliers\r\nde l'Ordre du Temple_ in 1811, and the _Lévitikon_ in 1831, together\r\nwith a version of the Gospel of St. John differing from the Vulgate.\r\nThese books, which appear to have been printed only for private\r\ncirculation amongst the members and are now extremely rare, relate that\r\nthe Order of the Temple had never ceased to exist since the days of\r\nJacques du Molay, who appointed Jacques de Larménie his successor in\r\noffice, and from that time onwards a line of Grand Masters had succeeded\r\neach other without a break up to the end of the eighteenth century, when\r\nit ceased for a brief period but was reinstituted under a new Grand\r\nMaster, Fabré Palaprat, in 1804. Besides publishing the list of all\r\nGrand Masters, known as the \"Charter of Larmenius,\" said to have been\r\npreserved in the secret archives of the Temple, these works also\r\nreproduce another document drawn from the same repository describing the\r\norigins of the Order. This manuscript, written in Greek on parchment,\r\ndated 1154, purports to be partly taken from a fifth-century MS. and\r\nrelates that Hugues de Payens, first Grand Master of the Templars, was\r\ninitiated in 1118--that is to say, in the year the Order was\r\nfounded--into the religious doctrine of \"the Primitive Christian Church\"\r\nby its Sovereign Pontiff and Patriarch, Theoclet, sixtieth in direct\r\nsuccession from St. John the Apostle. The history of the Primitive\r\nChurch is then given as follows:\r\n\r\n     Moses was initiated in Egypt. Profoundly versed in the physical,\r\n     theological, and metaphysical mysteries of the priests, he knew how\r\n     to profit by these so as to surmount the power of the Mages and\r\n     deliver his companions. Aaron, his brother, and the chiefs of the\r\n     Hebrews became the depositaries of his doctrine....\r\n\r\n     The Son of God afterwards appeared on the scene of the world.... He\r\n     was brought up at the school of Alexandria.... Imbued with a spirit\r\n     wholly divine, endowed with the most astounding qualities\r\n     (_dispositions_), he was able to reach all the degrees of Egyptian\r\n     initiation. On his return to Jerusalem, he presented himself before\r\n     the chiefs of the Synagogue.... Jesus Christ, directing the fruit\r\n     of his lofty meditations towards universal civilization and the\r\n     happiness of the world, rent the veil which concealed the truth\r\n     from the peoples. He preached the love of God, the love of one's\r\n     neighbour, and equality before the common Father of all men....\r\n\r\n     Jesus conferred evangelical initiation on his apostles and\r\n     disciples. He transmitted his spirit to them, divided them into\r\n     several orders after the practice of John, the beloved disciple,\r\n     the apostle of fraternal love, whom he had instituted Sovereign\r\n     Pontiff and Patriarch....\r\n\r\nHere we have the whole Cabalistic legend of a secret doctrine descending\r\nfrom Moses, of Christ as an Egyptian initiate and founder of a secret\r\norder--a theory, of course, absolutely destructive of belief in His\r\ndivinity. The legend of the _Ordre du Temple_ goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     Up to about the year 1118 (i.e. the year the Order of the Temple\r\n     was founded) the mysteries and the hierarchic Order of the\r\n     initiation of Egypt, transmitted to the Jews by Moses, then to the\r\n     Christians by J.C., were religiously preserved by the successors of\r\n     St. John the Apostle. These mysteries and initiations, regenerated\r\n     by the evangelical initiation (or baptism), were a sacred trust\r\n     which the simplicity of the primitive and unchanging morality of\r\n     the _Brothers of the East_ had preserved from all adulteration....\r\n\r\n     The Christians, persecuted by the infidels, appreciating the\r\n     courage and piety of these brave crusaders, who, with the sword in\r\n     one hand and the cross in the other, flew to the defence of the\r\n     holy places, and, above all, doing striking justice to the virtues\r\n     and the ardent charity of Hugues de Payens, held it their duty to\r\n     confide to hands so pure the treasures of knowledge acquired\r\n     throughout so many centuries, sanctified by the cross, the dogma\r\n     and the morality of the Man-God. Hugues was invested with the\r\n     Apostolic Patriarchal power and placed in the legitimate order of\r\n     the successors of St. John the apostle or the evangelist.\r\n\r\n     Such is the origin of the foundation of the Order of the Temple and\r\n     of the fusion in this Order of the different kinds of initiation of\r\n     the Christians of the East designated under the title of Primitive\r\n     Christians or Johannites.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that all this story is subtly subversive of true\r\nChristianity, and that the appellation of Christians applied to the\r\nJohannites is an imposture. Indeed Fabré Palaprat, Grand Master of the\r\n_Ordre du Temple_ in 1804, who in his book on the Templars repeats the\r\nstory contained in the _Lévitikon and the Manuel des Chevaliers du\r\nTemple_, whilst making the same profession of \"primitive Christian\"\r\ndoctrines descending from St. John through Theoclet and Hugues de Payens\r\nto the Order over which he presides, goes on to say that the secret\r\ndoctrine of the Templars \"was essentially contrary to the canons of the\r\nChurch of Rome and that it is principally to this fact that one must\r\nattribute the persecution of which history has preserved the memory.\"[192]\r\nThe belief of the Primitive Christians, and consequently that the\r\nTemplars, with regard to the miracles of Christ is that He \"did or may\r\nhave done extraordinary or miraculous things,\" and that since \"God can\r\ndo things incomprehensible to human intelligence,\" the Primitive Church\r\nvenerates \"all the acts of Christ as they are described in the Gospel,\r\nwhether it considers them as acts of human science or whether as acts of\r\ndivine power.\"[193] Belief in the divinity of Christ is thus left an\r\nopen question, and the same attitude is maintained towards the\r\nResurrection, of which the story is omitted in the Gospel of St. John\r\npossessed by the Order. Fabré Palaprat further admits that the gravest\r\naccusations brought against the Templars were founded on facts which he\r\nattempts to explain away in the following manner:\r\n\r\n     The Templars having in 1307 carefully abstracted all the\r\n     manuscripts composing the secret archives of the Order from the\r\n     search made by authority, and these authentic manuscripts having\r\n     been preciously preserved since that period, we have to-day the\r\n     certainty that the Knights endured a great number of religious and\r\n     moral trials before reaching the different degrees of initiation:\r\n     thus, for example, the recipient might receive the injunction under\r\n     pain of death to trample on the crucifix or to worship an idol, but\r\n     if he yielded to the terror which they sought to inspire in him he\r\n     was declared unworthy of being admitted to the higher grades of the\r\n     Order. One can imagine in this way how beings, too feeble or too\r\n     immoral to endure the trials of initiation, may have accused the\r\n     Templars of giving themselves up to infamous practices and of\r\n     having superstitious beliefs.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not surprising that an Order which gave such injunctions\r\nas these, for whatever purpose, should have become the object of\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nEliphas Lévi, who, like Ragon, accepts the statements of the _Ordre du\r\nTemple_ concerning the \"Johannite\" origin of the Templars' secret\r\ndoctrine, is, however, not deceived by these professions of\r\nChristianity, and boldly asserts that the Sovereign Pontiff Theoclet\r\ninitiated Hugues de Payens \"into the mysteries and hopes of his\r\npretended Church, he lured him by the ideas of sacerdotal sovereignty\r\nand supreme royalty, he indicated him finally as his successor. So the\r\nOrder of the Knights of the Temple was stained from its origin with\r\nschism and conspiracy against Kings.\"[194] Further, Lévi relates that\r\nthe real story told to initiates concerning Christ was no other than the\r\ninfamous _Toledot Yeshu_ described in the first chapter of this book,\r\nand which the Johannites dared to attribute to St. John.[195] This would\r\naccord with the confession of the Catalonian Knight Templar, Galcerandus\r\nde Teus, who stated that the form of absolution in the Order was: \"I\r\npray God that He may pardon your sins as He pardoned St. Mary Magdalene\r\nand the thief on the cross\"; but the witness went on to explain:\r\n\r\n     By the thief of which the head of the Chapter speaks, is meant,\r\n     according to our statutes, that Jesus or Christ who was crucified\r\n     by the Jews because he was not God, and yet he said he was God and\r\n     the King of the Jews, which was an outrage to the true God who is\r\n     in Heaven. When Jesus, a few moments before his death, had his side\r\n     pierced by the lance of Longinus, he repented of having called\r\n     himself God and King of the Jews and he asked pardon of the true\r\n     God; then the true God pardoned him. It is thus that we apply to\r\n     the crucified Christ these words: \"as God pardoned the thief on the\r\n     cross.\"[196]\r\n\r\nRaynouard, who quotes this deposition, stigmatizes it as \"singular and\r\nextravagant\"; M. Matter agrees that it is doubtless extravagant, but\r\nthat \"it merits attention. There was a whole system there, which was not\r\nthe invention of Galcerant.\"[197] Eliphas Lévi provides the clue to that\r\nsystem and to the reason why Christ was described as a thief, by\r\nindicating the Cabalistic legend wherein He was described as having\r\n_stolen_ the sacred Name from the Holy of Holies. Elsewhere he explains\r\nthat the Johannites \"made themselves out to be the only people initiated\r\ninto the true mysteries of the religion of the Saviour. They professed\r\nto know the real history of Jesus Christ, and by adopting part of Jewish\r\ntraditions and the stories of the Talmud, they made out that the facts\r\nrelated in the Gospels\"--that is to say, the Gospels accepted by the\r\northodox Church--\"were only allegories of which St. John gives the\r\nkey.\"[198]\r\n\r\nBut it is time to pass from legend to facts. For the whole story of the\r\ninitiation of the Templars by the \"Johannites\" rests principally on the\r\ndocuments produced by the Ordre du Temple in 1811. According to the\r\nAbbés Grégoire and Münter the authenticity and antiquity of these\r\ndocuments are beyond dispute. Grégoire, referring to the parchment\r\nmanuscript of the _Lévitikon_ and Gospel of St. John, says that\r\n\"Hellenists versed in paleography believe this manuscript to be of the\r\nthirteenth century, others declare it to be earlier and to go back to\r\nthe eleventh century.\"[199] Matter, on the other hand, quoting Münter's\r\nopinion that the manuscripts in the archives of the modern Templars date\r\nfrom the thirteenth century, observes that this is all a tissue of\r\nerrors and that the critics, including the learned Professor Thilo of\r\nHalle, have recognized that the manuscript in question, far from\r\nbelonging to the thirteenth century, dates from the beginning of the\r\neighteenth. From the arrangement of the chapters of the Gospel, M.\r\nMatter arrives at the conclusion that it was intended to accompany the\r\nceremonies of some masonic or secret society.[200] We shall return to\r\nthis possibility in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the manuscript containing the history of the Templars\r\nthus remains an open question on which no one can pronounce an opinion\r\nwithout having seen the original. In order, then, to judge of the\r\nprobability of the story that this manuscript contained it is necessary\r\nto consult the facts of history and to discover what proof can be found\r\nthat any such sect as the Johannites existed at the time of the Crusades\r\nor earlier. Certainly none is known to have been called by this name or\r\nby one resembling it before 1622, when some Portuguese monks reported\r\nthe existence of a sect whom they described as \"Christians of St. John\"\r\ninhabiting the banks of the Euphrates. The appellation appears, however,\r\nto have been wrongly applied by the monks, for the sectarians in\r\nquestion, variously known as the Mandæans, Mandaites, Sabians,\r\nNazoreans, etc., called themselves Mandaï Iyahi, that is to say, the\r\ndisciples, or rather the wise men, of John, the word _mandaï_ being\r\nderived from the Chaldean word _manda_, corresponding to the Greek word\r\nγνῶσις or wisdom.[201] The multiplicity of names given to the\r\nMandæans arises apparently from the fact that in their dealings with\r\nother communities they took the name of Sabians, whilst they called the\r\nwise and learned amongst themselves Nazoreans.[202] The sect formerly\r\ninhabited the banks of the Jordan, but was driven out by the Moslems,\r\nwho forced them to retire to Mesopotamia and Babylonia, where they\r\nparticularly affected the neighbourhood of rivers in order to be able to\r\ncarry out their peculiar baptismal rites.[203]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the doctrines of the Mandæans do resemble the\r\ndescription of the Johannite heresy as given by Eliphas Lévi, though not\r\nby the _Ordre du Temple_, in that the Mandæans professed to be the\r\ndisciples of St. John--the Baptist, however, not the Apostle--but were\r\nat the same time the enemies of Jesus Christ. According to the Mandæans'\r\n_Book of John_ (Sidra d'Yahya), Yahya, that is to say, St. John,\r\nbaptized myriads of men during forty years in the Jordan. By a\r\nmistake--or in response to a written mandate from heaven saying,\r\n\"Yahya, baptize the liar in the Jordan\"--he baptized the false prophet\r\nYishu Meshiha (the Messiah Jesus), son of the devil Ruha Kadishta.[204]\r\nThe same idea is found in another book of the sect, called the \"Book of\r\nAdam,\" which represents Jesus as the perverter of St. John's doctrine\r\nand the disseminator of iniquity and perfidy throughout the world.[205]\r\nThe resemblance between all this and the legends of the Talmud, the\r\nCabala, and the Toledot Yeshu is at once apparent; moreover, the\r\nMandæans claim for the \"Book of Adam\" the same origin as the Jews\r\nclaimed for the Cabala, namely, that it was delivered to Adam by God\r\nthrough the hands of the angel Razael.[206] This book, known to scholars\r\nas the _Codex Nasaræus_, is described by Münter as \"a sort of mosaic\r\nwithout order, without method, where one finds mentioned Noah, Abraham,\r\nMoses, Solomon, the Temple of Jerusalem, St. John the Baptist, Jesus\r\nChrist, the Christians, and Mohammed.\" M. Matter, whilst denying any\r\nproof of the Templar succession from the Mandæans, nevertheless gives\r\ngood reason for believing that the sect itself existed from the first\r\ncenturies of the Christian era and that its books dated from the eighth\r\ncentury[207]; further that these Mandæans or Nazoreans--not to be\r\nconfounded with the pre-Christian Nazarites or Christian Nazarenes--were\r\nJews who revered St. John the Baptist as the prophet of ancient Mosaism,\r\nbut regarded Jesus Christ as a false Messiah sent by the powers of\r\ndarkness.[208] Modern Jewish opinion confirms this affirmation of Judaic\r\ninspiration and agrees with Matter in describing the Mandæans as\r\nGnostics: \"Their sacred books are in an Aramaic dialect, which has close\r\naffinities with that of the Talmud of Babylon.\" The Jewish influence is\r\ndistinctly visible in the Mandæan religion. \"It is essentially of the\r\ntype of ancient Gnosticism, traces of which are found in the Talmud, the\r\nMidrash, and in a modified form the later Cabala.\"[209]\r\n\r\nIt may then be regarded as certain that a sect existed long before the\r\ntime of the Crusades corresponding to the description of the Johannites\r\ngiven by Eliphas Lévi in that it was Cabalistic, anti-Christian, yet\r\nprofessedly founded on the doctrines of one of the St. Johns. Whether it\r\nwas by this sect that the Templars were indoctrinated must remain an\r\nopen question. M. Matter objects that the evidence lacking to such a\r\nconclusion lies in the fact that the Templars expressed no particular\r\nreverence for St. John; but Loiseleur asserts that the Templars did\r\nprefer the Gospel of St. John to that of the other evangelists, and that\r\nmodern masonic lodges claiming descent from the Templars possess a\r\nspecial version of this Gospel said to have been copied from the\r\noriginal on Mount Athos.[210] It is also said that \"Baphomets\" were\r\npreserved in the masonic lodges of Hungary, where a debased form of\r\nMasonry, known as Johannite Masonry, survives to this day. If the\r\nTemplar heresy was that of the Johannites, the head in question might\r\npossibly represent that of John the Baptist, which would accord with the\r\ntheory that the word Baphomet was derived from Greek words signifying\r\nbaptism of wisdom. This would, moreover, not be incompatible with\r\nLoiseleur's theory of an affinity between the Templars and the Bogomils,\r\nfor the Bogomils also possessed their own version of the Gospel of St.\r\nJohn, which they placed on the heads of their neophytes during the\r\nceremony of initiation,[211] giving as the reason for the 'I peculiar\r\nveneration they professed for its author that they regarded St. John as\r\nthe servant of the Jewish God Satanael.[212] Eliphas Lévi even goes so\r\nfar as to accuse the Templars of following the occult practices of the\r\nLuciferians, who carried the doctrines of the Bogomils to the point of\r\npaying homage to the powers of darkness:\r\n\r\n     Let us declare for the edification of the vulgar ... and for the\r\n     greater glory of the Church which has persecuted the Templars,\r\n     burned the magicians and excommunicated the Free-Masons, etc., let\r\n     us say boldly and loudly, that all the initiates of the occult\r\n     sciences ... have adored, do and will always adore that which is\r\n     signified by this frightful symbol [the Sabbatic goat].[213] Yes,\r\n     in our profound conviction, the Grand Masters of the Order of the\r\n     Templars adored Baphomet and caused him to be adored by their\r\n     initiates.[214]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that the accusation of heresy brought against the\r\nTemplars does not emanate solely from the Catholic Church, but also from\r\nthe secret societies. Even our Freemasons, who, for reasons I shall show\r\nlater, have generally defended the Order, are now willing to admit that\r\nthere was a very real case against them. Thus Dr. Ranking, who has\r\ndevoted many years of study to the question, has arrived at the\r\nconclusion that Johannism is the real clue to the Templar heresy. In a\r\nvery interesting paper published in the masonic journal _Ars Quatuor\r\nCoronatorum_, he observes that \"the record of the Templars in Palestine\r\nis one long tale of intrigue and treachery on the part of the Order,\"\r\nand finally:\r\n\r\n     That from the very commencement of Christianity there has been\r\n     transmitted through the centuries a body of doctrine incompatible\r\n     with Christianity in the various official Churches....\r\n\r\n     That the bodies teaching these doctrines professed to do so on the\r\n     authority of St. John, to whom, as they claimed, the true secrets\r\n     had been committed by the Founder of Christianity.\r\n\r\n     That during the Middle Ages the main support of the Gnostic bodies\r\n     and the main repository of this knowledge was the Society of the\r\n     Templars.[215]\r\n\r\nWhat is the explanation of this choice of St. John for the propagation\r\nof anti-Christian doctrines which we shall find continuing up to the\r\npresent day? What else than the method of perversion which in its\r\nextreme form becomes Satanism, and consists in always selecting the most\r\nsacred things for the purpose of desecration? Precisely then because the\r\nGospel of St. John is the one of all the four which most insists on the\r\ndivinity of Christ, the occult anti-Christian sects have habitually made\r\nit the basis of their rites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nTHREE CENTURIES OF OCCULTISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the foregoing chapters that from very early times\r\noccult sects had existed for two purposes--esoteric and political.\r\nWhilst the Manicheans, the early Ismailis, the Bogomils, and the\r\nLuciferians had concerned themselves mainly with religious or esoteric\r\ndoctrines, the later Ismailis, the Fatimites, the Karmathites, and\r\nTemplars had combined secrecy and occult rites with the political aim of\r\ndomination. We shall find this double tradition running through all the\r\nsecret society movement up to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Dualist doctrines attributed to the Templars were not, however,\r\nconfined to this Order in Europe, but had been, as we have seen, those\r\nprofessed by the Bogomils and also by the Cathari, who spread westwards\r\nfrom Bulgaria and Bosnia to France. It was owing to their sojourn in\r\nBulgaria that the Cathari gained the popular nickname of \"Bulgars\" or\r\n\"Bourgres,\" signifying those addicted to unnatural vice. One section of\r\nthe Cathari in the South of France became known after 1180 as the\r\nAlbigenses, thus called from the town of Albi, although their\r\nheadquarters were really in Toulouse. Christians only in name, they\r\nadhered in secret to the Gnostic and Manichean doctrines of the earlier\r\nCathari, which they would appear to have combined with Johannism, since,\r\nlike this Eastern sect, they claimed to possess their own Gospel of St.\r\nJohn.[216]\r\n\r\nAlthough not strictly a secret society, the Albigenses were divided\r\nafter the secret society system into initiates and semi-initiates. The\r\nformer, few in number, known as the _Perfecti_, led in appearance an\r\naustere life, refraining from meat and professing abhorrence of oaths\r\nor of lying. The mystery in which they enveloped themselves won for them\r\nthe adoring reverence of the _Credentes_, who formed the great majority\r\nof the sect and gave themselves up to every vice, to usury, brigandage,\r\nand perjury, and whilst describing marriage as prostitution, condoning\r\nincest and all forms of licence.[217] The _Credentes_, who were probably\r\nnot fully initiated into the Dualist doctrines of their superiors,\r\nlooked to them for salvation through the laying-on of hands according to\r\nthe system of the Manicheans.\r\n\r\nIt was amongst the nobles of Languedoc that the Albigenses found their\r\nprincipal support. This \"Judæa of France,\" as it has been called, was\r\npeopled by a medley of mixed races, Iberian, Gallic, Roman, and\r\nSemitic.[218] The nobles, very different from the \"ignorant and pious\r\nchivalry of the North,\" had lost all respect for their traditions.\r\n\"There were few who in going back did not encounter some Saracen or\r\nJewish grandmother in their genealogy.\"[219] Moreover, many had brought\r\nback to Europe the laxity of morals they had contracted during the\r\nCrusades. The Comte de Comminges practised polygamy, and, according to\r\necclesiastical chronicles, Raymond VI, Comte de Toulouse, one of the\r\nmost ardent of the Albigense _Credentes_, had his harem.[220] The\r\nAlbigensian movement has been falsely represented as a protest merely\r\nagainst the tyranny of the Church of Rome; in reality it was a rising\r\nagainst the fundamental doctrines of Christianity--more than this,\r\nagainst all principles of religion and morality. For whilst some of the\r\nsect openly declared that the Jewish law was preferable to that of the\r\nChristians,[221] to others the God of the Old Testament was as abhorrent\r\nas the \"false Christ\" who suffered at Golgotha; the old hatred of the\r\nGnostics and Manicheans for the demiurgus lived again in these rebels\r\nagainst the social order. Forerunners of the seventeenth-century\r\nLibertines and eighteenth-century Illuminati, the Albigense nobles,\r\nunder the pretext of fighting the priesthood, strove to throw off all\r\nthe restraints the Church imposed.\r\n\r\nInevitably the disorders that took place throughout the South of France\r\nled to reprisals, and the Albigenses were suppressed with all the\r\ncruelty of the age--a fact which has afforded historians the opportunity\r\nto exalt them as noble martyrs, victims of ecclesiastical despotism. But\r\nagain, as in the case of the Templars, the fact that they were\r\npersecuted does not prove them innocent of the crimes laid to their\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSatanism\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century another development of\r\nDualism, far more horrible than the Manichean heresy of the Albigenses,\r\nbegan to make itself felt. This was the cult of Satanism, or black\r\nmagic. The subject is one that must be approached with extreme caution,\r\nowing to the fact that on one hand much that has been written about it\r\nis the result of mediæval superstition, which sees in every departure\r\nfrom the Roman Catholic Faith the direct intervention of the Evil One,\r\nwhilst on the other hand the conspiracy of history, which denies _in\r\ntoto_ the existence of the Occult Power, discredits all revelations on\r\nthis question, from whatever source they emanate, as the outcome of\r\nhysterical imagination.[222] This is rendered all the easier since the\r\nsubject by its amazing extravagance lends itself to ridicule.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, idle to deny that the cult of evil has always existed;\r\nthe invocation of the powers of darkness was practised in the earliest\r\ndays of the human race and, after the Christian era, found its\r\nexpression, as we have seen, in the Cainites, the Euchites, and the\r\nLuciferians. These are not surmises, but actual facts of history.\r\nTowards the end of the twelfth century Luciferianism spread eastwards\r\nthrough Styria, the Tyrol, and Bohemia, even as far as Brandenburg; by\r\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century it had invaded western Germany,\r\nand in the fourteenth century reached its zenith in that country, as\r\nalso in Italy and France. The cult had now reached a further stage in\r\nits development, and it was not the mere propitiation of Satanael as the\r\nprince of this world practised by the Luciferians, but actual\r\nSatanism--the love of evil for the sake of evil--which formed the\r\ndoctrine of the sect known in Italy as _la vecchia religione_ or the\r\n\"old religion.\" Sorcery was adopted as a profession, and witches, not,\r\nas is popularly supposed, sporadic growths, were trained in schools of\r\nmagic to practise their art. These facts should be remembered when the\r\nChurch is blamed for the violence it displayed against witchcraft--it\r\nwas not individuals, but a system which it set out to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe essence of Satanism is desecration. In the ceremonies for infernal\r\nevocation described by Eliphas Lévi we read: \"It is requisite to profane\r\nthe ceremonies of the religion one belongs to and to trample its holiest\r\nsymbols under foot.\"[223] This practice found a climax in desecrating\r\nthe Holy Sacrament. The consecrated wafer was given as food to mice,\r\ntoads, and pigs, or denied in unspeakable ways. A revolting description\r\nof the Black Mass may be found in Huysmans's book _Là-bas_. It is\r\nunnecessary to transcribe the loathsome details here. Suffice it, then,\r\nto show that this cult had a very real existence, and if any further\r\ndoubt remains on the matter, the life of Gilles de Rais supplies\r\ndocumentary evidence of the visible results of black magic in the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nGilles de Rais was born at Machecoul in Brittany about the year 1404.\r\nThe first period of his life was glorious; the companion and guide of\r\nJeanne d'Arc, he became Maréchal of France and distinguished himself by\r\nmany deeds of valour. But after dissipating his immense fortune, largely\r\non Church ceremonies carried out with the wildest extravagance, he was\r\nled to study alchemy, partly by curiosity and partly as a means for\r\nrestoring his shattered fortunes. Hearing that Germany and Italy were\r\nthe countries where alchemy flourished, he enlisted Italians in his\r\nservice and was gradually drawn into the further region of magic.\r\nAccording to Huysmans, Gilles de Rais had remained until this moment a\r\nChristian mystic under the influence of Jeanne d'Arc, but after her\r\ndeath--possibly in despair--he offered himself to the powers of\r\ndarkness. Evokers of Satan now flocked to him from every side, amongst\r\nthem Prelati, an Italian, by no means the old and wrinkled sorcerer of\r\ntradition, but a young and attractive man of charming manners. For it\r\nwas from Italy that came the most skilful adepts in the art of alchemy,\r\nastrology, magic, and infernal evocation, who spread themselves over\r\nEurope, particularly France. Under the influence of these initiators\r\nGilles de Rais signed a letter to the devil in a meadow near Machecoul\r\nasking him for \"knowledge, power, and riches,\" and offering in exchange\r\nanything that might be asked of him with the exception of his life or\r\nhis soul. But in spite of this appeal and of a pact signed with the\r\nblood of the writer, no Satanic apparitions were forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIt was then that, becoming still more desperate, Gilles de Rais had\r\nrecourse to the abominations for which his name has remained\r\ninfamous--still more frightful invocations, loathsome debaucheries,\r\nperverted vice in every form, Sadic cruelties, horrible sacrifices, and,\r\nfinally, holocausts of little boys and girls collected by his agents in\r\nthe surrounding country and put to death with the most inhuman tortures.\r\nDuring the years 1432-40 literally hundreds of children disappeared.\r\nMany of the names of the unhappy little victims were preserved in the\r\nrecords of the period. Gilles de Rais met with a well-deserved end: in\r\n1440 he was hanged and burnt. So far he does not appear to have found a\r\npanegyrist to place him in the ranks of noble martyrs.\r\n\r\nIt will, of course, be urged that the crimes here described were those\r\nof a criminal lunatic and not to be attributed to any occult cause; the\r\nanswer to this is that Gilles was not an isolated unit, but one of a\r\ngroup of occultists who cannot all have been mad. Moreover, it was only\r\nafter his invocation of the Evil One that he developed these monstrous\r\nproclivities. So also his eighteenth-century replica, the Marquis de\r\nSade, combined with his abominations an impassioned hatred of the\r\nChristian religion.\r\n\r\nWhat is the explanation of this craze for magic in Western Europe?\r\nDeschamps points to the Cabala, \"that science of demoniacal arts, of\r\nwhich the Jews were the initiators,\" and undoubtedly in any\r\ncomprehensive review of the question the influence of the Jewish\r\nCabalists cannot be ignored. In Spain, Portugal, Provence, and Italy the\r\nJews by the fifteenth century had become a power; as early as 1450 they\r\nhad penetrated into the intellectual circles of Florence, and it was\r\nalso in Italy that, a century later, the modern Cabalistic school was\r\ninaugurated by Isaac Luria (1533-72), whose doctrines were organized\r\ninto a practical system by the Hasidim of Eastern Europe for the writing\r\nof amulets, the conjuration of devils, mystical jugglery with numbers\r\nand letters, etc.[224] Italy in the fifteenth century was thus a centre\r\nfrom which Cabalistic influences radiated, and it may be that the\r\nItalians who indoctrinated Gilles de Rais had drawn their inspiration\r\nfrom this source. Indeed Eliphas Lévi, who certainly cannot be accused\r\nof \"Anti-Semitism,\" declares that \"the Jews, the most faithful trustees\r\nof the secret of the Cabala, were almost always the reat masters of\r\nmagic in the Middle Ages,\"[225] and suggests that Gilles de Rais took\r\nhis monstrous recipes for using the blood of murdered children \"from\r\nsome of those old Hebrew _grimoires_ (books on magic), which, if they\r\nhad been known, would have sufficed to hold up the Jews to the\r\nexecration of the whole earth.\"[226] Voltaire, in his _Henriade_,\r\nlikewise attributes the magical blood-rites practised in the sixteenth\r\ncentury to Jewish inspiration:\r\n\r\n    Dans l'ombre de la nuit, sous une voûte obscure,\r\n    Le silence conduit leui assemblée impure.\r\n    A la pàle lueur d'un magique flambeau\r\n    S'élève un vil autel dressé sur un tombeau.\r\n    C'est là que des deux rois on plaça les images,\r\n    Objets de leur terreur, objets de leurs outrages.\r\n    Leurs sacrilèges mains out mêlé sur l'autel\r\n    A des noms infernaux le nom de l'Éternel.\r\n    Sur ces murs ténébreux des lances sont rangées,\r\n    Dans des vases de sang leurs pointes sont plongées;\r\n    Appareil menaçant de leur mystère affreux.\r\n    Le prêtre de ce temple est un de ces Hébreux\r\n    Qui, proscrits sur la terre et citoyens du monde,\r\n    Portent de mers en mers leur misère profonde,\r\n    Et, d'un antique ramas de superstitions,\r\n    Out rempli dès longtemps toutes les nations, etc.\r\n\r\nVoltaire adds in a footnote: \"It was ordinarily Jews that were made use\r\nof for magical operations. This ancient superstition comes from the\r\nsecrets of the Cabala, of which the Jews called themselves the sole\r\ndepositaries. Catherine de Medicis, the Maréchal d'Ancre, and many\r\nothers employed Jews for these spells.\"\r\n\r\nThis charge of black magic recurs all through the history of Europe from\r\nthe earliest times. The Jews are accused of poisoning wells, of\r\npractising ritual murder, of using stolen church property for purposes\r\nof desecration, etc. No doubt there enters into all this a great amount\r\nof exaggeration, inspired by popular prejudice and mediæval\r\nsuperstition. Yet, whilst condeming the persecution to which the Jews\r\nwere subjected on this account, it must be admitted that they laid\r\nthemselves open to suspicion by their real addiction to magical arts. If\r\nignorant superstition is found on the side of the persecutors, still\r\nmore amazing superstition is found on the side of the persecuted.\r\nDemonology in Europe was in fact essentially a Jewish science, for\r\nalthough a belief in evil spirits existed from the earliest times and\r\nhas always continued to exist amongst primitive races, and also amongst\r\nthe ignorant classes in civilized countries, it was mainly through the\r\nJews that these dark superstitions were imported to the West, where they\r\npersisted not merely amongst the lower strata of the Jewish population,\r\nbut formed an essential part of Jewish tradition. Thus the Talmud says:\r\n\r\n     If the eye could perceive the demons that people the universe,\r\n     existence would be impossible. The demons are more numerous than we\r\n     are: they surround us on all sides like trenches dug round\r\n     vineyards. Every one of us has a thousand on his left hand and ten\r\n     thousand on his right. The discomfort endured by those who attend\r\n     rabbinical conferences ... comes from the demons mingling with men\r\n     in these circumstances. Besides, the fatigue one feels in one's\r\n     knees in walking comes from the demons that one knocks up against\r\n     at every step. If the clothing of the Rabbis wears out so quickly,\r\n     it is again because the demons rub up against them. Whoever wants\r\n     to convince himself of their presence has only to surround his bed\r\n     with sifted cinders and the next morning he will see the imprints\r\n     of cocks' feet.[227]\r\n\r\nThe same treatise goes on to give directions for seeing demons by\r\nburning portions of a black cat and placing the ashes in one's eye:\r\n\"then at once one perceives the demons.\" The Talmud also explains that\r\ndevils particularly inhabit the waterspouts on houses and are fond of\r\ndrinking out of water-jugs, therefore it is advisable to pour a little\r\nwater out of a jug before drinking, so as to get rid of the unclean\r\npart.[228]\r\n\r\nThese ideas received a fresh impetus from the publication of the Zohar,\r\nwhich, a Jewish writer tells us, \"from the fourteenth century held\r\nalmost unbroken sway over the minds of the majority of the Jews. In it\r\nthe Talmudic legends concerning the existence and activity of the\r\n_shedhim_ (demons) are repeated and amplified, and a hierarchy of demons\r\nwas established corresponding to the heavenly hierarchy.... Manasseh\r\n[ben Israel]'s _Nishmat Hayim_ is full of information concerning belief\r\nin demons.... Even the scholarly and learned Rabbis of the seventeenth\r\ncentury clung to the belief.\"[229]\r\n\r\nHere, then, it is not a case of ignorant peasants evolving fantastic\r\nvisions from their own scared imaginations, but of the Rabbis, the\r\nacknowledged leaders of a race claiming civilized traditions and a high\r\norder of intelligence, deliberately inculcating in their disciples the\r\nperpetual fear of demoniacal influences. How much of this fear\r\ncommunicated itself to the Gentile population? It is at any rate a\r\ncurious coincidence to notice the resemblances between so-called popular\r\nsuperstitions and the writings of the Rabbis. For example, the vile\r\nconfessions made both by Scotch and French peasant women accused of\r\nwitchcraft concerning the nocturnal visits paid them by male devils[230]\r\nfind an exact counterpart in passages of the Cabala, where it is said\r\nthat \"the demons are both male and female, and they also endeavour to\r\nconsort with human beings--a conception from which arises the belief in\r\n_incubi_ and _succubæ_.\"[231] Thus, on Jewish authority, we learn the\r\nJudaic origin of this strange delusion.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly to the same source that we may trace the magical formulæ\r\nfor the healing of diseases current at the same period. From the\r\nearliest times the Jews had specialized in medicine, and many royal\r\npersonages insisted on employing Jewish doctors,[232] some of whom may\r\nhave acquired medical knowledge of a high order. The Jewish writer\r\nMargoliouth dwells on this fact with some complacency, and goes on to\r\ncontrast the scientific methods of the Hebrew doctors with the\r\nquackeries of the monks:\r\n\r\n     In spite of the reports circulated by the monks, that the Jews were\r\n     sorcerers (in consequence of their superior medical skill),\r\n     Christian patients would frequent the houses of the Jewish\r\n     physicians in preference to the monasteries, where cures were\r\n     pretended to have been effected by some extraordinary relics, such\r\n     as the nails of St. Augustine, the extremity of St. Peter's second\r\n     toe, ... etc. It need hardly be added that the cures effected by\r\n     the Jewish physicians were more numerous than those by the monkish\r\n     impostors.[233]\r\n\r\nYet in reality the grotesque remedies which Margoliouth attributes to\r\nChristian superstition appear to have been partly derived from Jewish\r\nsources. The author of a further article on Magic in Hastings'\r\n_Encyclopædia_ goes on to say that the magical formulæ handed down in\r\nLatin in ancient medical writings and used by the monks were mainly of\r\nEastern origin, derived from Babylonish, Egyptian, and Jewish magic. The\r\nmonks therefore \"played merely an intermediate rôle.\"[234] Indeed, if\r\nwe turn to the Talmud we shall find cures recommended no less absurd\r\nthan those which Margoliouth derides. For example:\r\n\r\n     The eggs of a grasshopper as a remedy for toothache, the tooth of a\r\n     fox as a remedy for sleep, viz. the tooth of a live fox to prevent\r\n     sleep and of a dead one to cause sleep, the nail from the gallows\r\n     where a man was hanged, as a remedy for swelling.[235]\r\n\r\nA strongly \"pro-Semite\" writer quotes a number of Jewish medical\r\nwritings of the eighteenth century, republished as late as the end of\r\nthe nineteenth, which show the persistence of these magical formulæ\r\namongst the Jews. Most of these are too loathsome to transcribe; but\r\nsome of the more innocuous are as follows: \"For epilepsy kill a cock and\r\nlet it putrefy.\" \"In order to protect yourself from all evils, gird\r\nyourself with the rope with which a criminal has been hung.\" Blood of\r\ndifferent kinds also plays an important part: \"Fox's blood and wolf's\r\nblood are good for stone in the bladder, ram's blood for colic, weasel\r\nblood for scrofula,\" etc.--these to be externally applied.[236]\r\n\r\nBut to return to Satanism. Whoever were the secret inspirers of magical\r\nand diabolical practices during the fourteenth to the eighteenth\r\ncenturies, the evidence of the existence of Satanism during this long\r\nperiod is overwhelming and rests on the actual facts of history. Details\r\nquite as extravagant and revolting as those contained in the works of\r\nEliphas Lévi[237] or in Huysmans's _Là-bas_ are given in documentary\r\nform by Margaret Alice Murray in her singularly passionless work\r\nrelating principally to the witches of Scotland.[238]\r\n\r\nThe cult of evil is a reality--by whatever means we may seek to explain\r\nit. Eliphas Lévi, whilst denying the existence of Satan \"as a superior\r\npersonality and power,\" admits this fundamental truth: \"Evil exists; it\r\nis impossible to doubt it. We can do good or evil. There are beings who\r\nknowingly and voluntarily do evil.\"[239] There are also beings who love\r\nevil. Lévi has admirably described the spirit that animates such beings\r\nin his definition of black magic:\r\n\r\n     Black magic is really but a combination of sacrileges and murders\r\n     graduated with a view to the permanent perversion of the human will\r\n     and the realization in a living man of the monstrous phantom of the\r\n     fiend. It is, therefore, properly speaking, the religion of the\r\n     devil, the worship of darkness, the hatred of goodness exaggerated\r\n     to the point of paroxysm; it is the incarnation of death and the\r\n     permanent creation of hell.[240]\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages, which depicted the devil fleeing from holy water, were\r\nnot perhaps quite so benighted as our superior modern culture has led us\r\nto suppose. For that \"hatred of goodness exaggerated to the point of\r\nparoxysm,\" that impulse to desecrate and defile which forms the basis of\r\nblack magic and has manifested itself in successive phases of the\r\nworld-revolution, springs from fear. So by their very hatred the powers\r\nof darkness proclaim the existence of the powers of light and their own\r\nimpotence. In the cry of the demoniac: \"What have we to do with Thee,\r\nJesus of Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou\r\nart, the Holy One of God,\" do we not hear the unwilling tribute of the\r\nvanquished to the victor in the mighty conflict between good; and evil?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rosicrucians\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the question of Magic it is necessary to realize that\r\nalthough to the world in general the word is synonymous with necromancy,\r\nit does not bear this significance in the language of occultism,\r\nparticularly the occultism of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\nMagic at this date was a term employed to cover many branches of\r\ninvestigation which Robert Fludd, the English Rosicrucian, classified\r\nunder various headings, of which the first three are as follows: (1)\r\n\"_Natural Magic_, ... that most occult and secret department of physics\r\nby which the mystical properties of natural substances are extracted\";\r\n(2) _Mathematical Magic_, which enables adepts in the art to \"construct\r\nmarvellous machines by means of their geometrical knowledge \"; whilst\r\n(3) _Venefic Magic_ \"is familiar with potions, philtres, and with\r\nvarious preparations of poisons.\"[241]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that all these have now passed into the realms of science\r\nand are no longer regarded as magical arts; but the further categories\r\nenumerated by Fludd and comprised under the general heading of\r\n_Necromantic Magic_ retain the popular sense of the term. These are\r\ndescribed as (i) _Goetic_, which consists in \"diabolical commerce with\r\nunclean spirits, in rites of criminal curiosity, in illicit songs and\r\ninvocations, and in the evocation of the souls of the dead\"; (2)\r\n_Maleficent_, which is the adjuration of the devils by the virtue of\r\nDivine Names; and (3) _Theurgic_, purporting \"to be governed by good\r\nangels and the Divine Will, but its wonders are most frequently\r\nperformed by evil spirits, who assume the names of God and of the\r\nangels.\" (4) \"The last species of magic is the _Thaumaturgic_, begetting\r\nillusory phenomena; by this art the Magi produced their phantoms and\r\nother marvels.\" To this list might be added _Celestial Magic_, or\r\nknowledge dealing with the influence of the heavenly bodies, on which\r\nastrology is based.\r\n\r\nThe forms of magic dealt with in the preceding part of this chapter\r\nbelong therefore to the second half of these categories, that is to say,\r\nto Necromantic Magic. But at the same period another movement was\r\ngradually taking shape which concerned itself with the first category\r\nenumerated above, that is to say, the secret properties of natural\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nA man whose methods appear to have approached to the modern conception\r\nof scientific research was Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim,\r\ncommonly known as Paracelsus, the son of a German doctor, born about\r\n1493, who during his travels in the East is said to have acquired a\r\nknowledge of some secret doctrine which he afterwards elaborated into a\r\nsystem for the healing of diseases. Although his ideas were thus\r\ndoubtless drawn from some of the same sources as those from which the\r\nJewish Cabala descended, Paracelsus does not appear to have been a\r\nCabalist, but a scientist of no mean order, and, as an isolated thinker,\r\napparently connected with no secret association, does not enter further\r\ninto the scope of this work.\r\n\r\nParacelsus must therefore not be identified with the school of so-called\r\n\"Christian Cabalists,\" who, from Raymond Lulli, the \"doctor illuminatus\"\r\nof the thirteenth century, onward, drew their inspiration from the\r\nCabala of the Jews. This is not to say that the influence under which\r\nthey fell was wholly pernicious, for, just as certain Jews appear to\r\nhave acquired some real medical skill, so also they appear to have\r\npossessed some real knowledge of natural science, inherited perhaps from\r\nthe ancient traditions of the East or derived from the writings of\r\nHippocrates, Galen, and other of the great Greek physicians and as yet\r\nunknown to Europe. Thus Eliphas Lévi relates that the Rabbi Jechiel, a\r\nCabalistic Jew protected by St. Louis, possessed the secret of\r\never-burning lamps,[242] claimed later by the Rosicrucians, which\r\nsuggests the possibility that some kind of luminous gas or electric\r\nlight may have been known to the Jews. In alchemy they were the\r\nacknowledged leaders; the most noted alchemist of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, Nicholas Flamel, discovered the secret of the art from the book\r\nof \"Abraham the Jew, Prince, Priest, Levite, Astrologer, and\r\nPhilosopher,\" and this actual book is said to have passed later into the\r\npossession of Cardinal Richelieu.[243]\r\n\r\nIt was likewise from a Florentine Jew, Alemanus or Datylus, that Pico\r\ndella Mirandola, the fifteenth-century mystic, received instructions in\r\nthe Cabala[244] and imagined that he had discovered in it the doctrines\r\nof Christianity. This delighted Pope Sixtus IV, who thereupon ordered\r\nCabalistic writings to be translated into Latin for the use of divinity\r\nstudents. At the same time the Cabala was introduced into Germany by\r\nReuchlin, who had learnt Hebrew from the Rabbi Jacob b. Jechiel Loans,\r\ncourt physician to Frederick III, and in 1494 published a Cabalistic\r\ntreatise _De Verbo Mirifico_, showing that all wisdom and true\r\nphilosophy are derived from the Hebrews. Considerable alarm appears,\r\nhowever, to have been created by the spread of Rabbinical literature,\r\nand in 1509 a Jew converted to Christianity, named Pfefferkorn,\r\npersuaded the Emperor Maximilian I to burn all Jewish books except the\r\nOld Testament. Reuchlin, consulted on this matter, advised only the\r\ndestruction of the Toledot Yeshu and of the Sepher Nizzachon by the\r\nRabbi Lipmann, because these works \"were full of blasphemies against\r\nChrist and against the Christian religion,\" but urged the preservation\r\nof the rest. In this defence of Jewish literature he was supported by\r\nthe Duke of Bavaria, who appointed him professor at Ingoldstadt, but was\r\nstrongly condemned by the Dominicans of Cologne. In reply to their\r\nattacks Reuchlin launched his defence _De Arte Cabalistica_, glorifying\r\nthe Cabala, of which the \"central doctrine for him was the Messianology\r\naround which all its other doctrines grouped themselves.\"[245] His\r\nwhole philosophical system, as he himself admitted, was in fact entirely\r\nCabalistic, and his views were shared by his contemporary Cornelius\r\nAgrippa of Nettesheim. As a result of these teachings a craze for\r\nCabalism spread amongst Christian prelates, statesmen, and warriors, and\r\na number of Christian thinkers took up the doctrines of the Cabala and\r\n\"essayed to work them over in their own way.\" Athanasius Kircher and\r\nKnorr, Baron von Rosenroth, author of the _Kabbala Denudata_, in the\r\ncourse of the seventeenth century \"endeavoured to spread the Cabala\r\namong the Christians by translating Cabalistic works which they regarded\r\nas most ancient wisdom.\" \"Most of them,\" the _Jewish Encyclopædia_ goes\r\non to observe derisively, \"held the absurd idea that the Cabala\r\ncontained proofs of the truth of Christianity.... Much that appears\r\nChristian [in the Cabala] is, in fact, nothing but the logical\r\ndevelopment of certain ancient esoteric doctrines.\"[246]\r\n\r\nThe Rosicrucians appear to have been the outcome both of this Cabalistic\r\nmovement and of the teachings of Paracelsus. The earliest intimation of\r\ntheir existence was given in a series of pamphlets which appeared at the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century. The first of these, entitled the\r\n_Fama Fraternitatis; or a Discovery of the Fraternity of the most\r\nLaudable Order of the Rosy Cross_, was published at Cassel in 1614 and\r\nthe _Confessio Fraternitatis_ early in the following year. These contain\r\nwhat may be described as the \"Grand Legend\" of Rosicrucianism, which has\r\nbeen repeated with slight variations up to the present day. Briefly,\r\nthis story is as follows[247]:\r\n\r\n\"The most godly and highly-illuminated Father, our brother C.R.,\" that\r\nis to say, Christian Rosenkreutz, \"a German, the chief and original of\r\nour Fraternity,\" was born in 1378, and some sixteen years later\r\ntravelled to the East with a Brother P.A.L., who had determined to go to\r\nthe Holy Land. On reaching Cyprus, Brother P.A.L. died and \"so never\r\ncame to Jerusalem.\" Brother C.R., however, having become acquainted with\r\ncertain Wise Men of \"Damasco in Arabia,\" and beheld what great wonders\r\nthey wrought, went on alone to Damasco. Here the Wise Men received him,\r\nand he then set himself to study Physick and Mathematics and to\r\ntranslate the Book M into Latin. After three years he went to Egypt,\r\nwhence he journeyed on to Fez, where \"he did get acquaintance with those\r\nwho are called the Elementary inhabitants, who revealed to him many of\r\ntheir secrets.... Of those of Fez he often did confess that their Magia\r\nwas not altogether pure and also that their Cabala was defiled with\r\ntheir religion, but notwithstanding he knew how to make good use of the\r\nsame.\" After two years Brother C.R. departed the city Fez and sailed\r\naway with many costly things into Spain, where he conferred with the\r\nlearned men and being \"ready bountifully to impart all his arts and\r\nsecrets\" showed them amongst other things how \"there might be a society\r\nin Europe which might have gold, silver, and precious stones sufficient\r\nfor them to bestow on kings for their necessary uses and lawful\r\npurposes....\"\r\n\r\nChristian Rosenkreutz then returned to Germany, where \"there is nowadays\r\nno want of learned men, Magicians, Cabalists, Physicians, and\r\nPhilosophers.\" Here he \"builded himself a fitting and neat habitation in\r\nwhich he ruminated his voyage and philosophy and reduced them together\r\nin a true memorial.\" At the end of five years' meditation there \"came\r\nagain into his mind the wished-for Reformation: accordingly he chose\r\nsome few adjoyned with him,\" the Brethren G.V., I.A., and I.O.--the\r\nlast of whom \"was very expert and well learned in Cabala as his book H\r\nwitnesseth\"--to form a circle of initiates. \"After this manner began\r\nthe Fraternity of the Rosy Cross.\" Five other Brethren were afterwards\r\nadded, all Germans except I.A., and these eight constituted his new\r\nbuilding called Sancti Spiritus. The following agreement was then drawn\r\nup:\r\n\r\n     First, that none of them should profess any other thing than to\r\n     cure the sick, and that gratis.\r\n\r\n     Second, none of the posterity should be constrained to wear one\r\n     certain kind of habit, but therein to follow the custom of the\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n     Third, that every year, upon the day C., they should meet together\r\n     at the house Sancti Spiritus, or write the cause of his absence.\r\n\r\n     Fourth, every Brother should look about for a worthy person who,\r\n     after his decease, might succeed him.\r\n\r\n     Fifth, the word C.R. should be their seal, mark, and character.\r\n\r\n     Sixth, the Fraternity should remain secret one hundred years.\r\n\r\nFinally Brother C.R. died, but where and when, or in what country he was\r\nburied, remained a secret. The date, however, is generally given as\r\n1484. In 1604 the Brethren who then constituted the inner circle of the\r\nOrder discovered a door on which was written in large letters\r\n\r\n     Post 120 Annos Patebo.\r\n\r\nOn opening the door a vault was disclosed to view, where beneath a brass\r\ntablet the body of Christian Rosenkreutz was found, \"whole and\r\nunconsumed,\" with all his \"ornaments and attires,\" and holding in his\r\nhand the parchment \"I\" which \"next unto the Bible is our greatest\r\ntreasure,\" whilst beside him lay a number of books, amongst others the\r\n_Vocabulario_ of Paracelsus, who, however, the _Fama_ observes, earlier\r\n\"was none of our Fraternity.\"[248]\r\n\r\nThe Brethren now knew that after a time there would be \"a general\r\nreformation both of divine and human things.\" While declaring their\r\nbelief in the Christian faith, the _Fama_ goes on to explain that:\r\n\r\n     Our Philosophy is not a new invention, but as Adam after his fall\r\n     hath received it and as Moses and Solomon used it, ... wherein\r\n     Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, and others did hit the mark and\r\n     wherein Enoch, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, did excel, but especially\r\n     wherewith that wonderful Book the Bible agreeth.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, according to this Manifesto, Rosicrucianism was a\r\ncombination of the ancient secret tradition handed down from the\r\npatriarchs through the philosophers of Greece and of the first Cabala of\r\nthe Jews.\r\n\r\nThe \"Grand Legend\" of Rosicrucianism rests, however, on no historical\r\nevidence; there is, in fact, not the least reason to suppose that any\r\nsuch person as Christian Rosenkreutz ever existed. The Illuminatus von\r\nKnigge in the eighteenth century asserted that:\r\n\r\n     It is now recognized amongst enlightened men that no real\r\n     Rosicrucians have existed, but that the whole of what is contained\r\n     in the _Fama_ and the _Universal Reformation of the World_ [another\r\n     Rosicrucian pamphlet which appeared in the same year] was only a\r\n     subtle allegory of Valentine Andrea, of which afterwards partly\r\n     deceivers (such as the Jesuits) and partly visionaries made use in\r\n     order to realize this dream.[249]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the origin of the name Rose-Cross? According to one\r\nRosicrucian tradition, the word \"Rose\" does not derive from the flower\r\ndepicted on the Rosicrucian cross, but from the Latin word _ros_,\r\nsignifying \"dew,\" which was supposed to be the most powerful solvent of\r\ngold, whilst _crux_, the cross, was the chemical hieroglyphic for\r\n\"light.\"[250] It is said that the Rosicrucians interpreted the initials\r\non the cross INRI by the sentence \"Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur.\"[251]\r\nSupposing this derivation to be correct, it would be interesting to know\r\nwhether any connexion could be traced between the first appearance of\r\nthe word Rosie Cross in the _Fama Fraternitatis_ at the date of 1614 and\r\nthe cabalistic treatise of the celebrated Rabbi of Prague, Shabbethai\r\nSheftel Horowitz, entitled _Shefa Tal_, that is to say, \"The Effusion of\r\nDew,\" which appeared in 1612.[252] Although this book has often been\r\nreprinted, no copy is to be found in the British Museum, so I am unable\r\nto pursue this line of enquiry further. A simpler explanation may be\r\nthat the Rosy Cross derived from the Red Cross of the Templars.\r\nMirabeau, who as a Freemason and an Illuminatus was in a position to\r\ndiscover many facts about the secret societies of Germany during his\r\nstay in the country, definitely asserts that \"the Rose Croix Masons of\r\nthe seventeenth century were only the ancient Order of the Templars\r\nsecretly perpetuated.\"[253]\r\n\r\nLecouteulx de Canteleu is more explicit:\r\n\r\n     In France the Knights (Templar) who left the Order, henceforth\r\n     hidden, and so to speak unknown, formed the Order of the Flaming\r\n     Star and of the Rose-Croix, which in the fifteenth century spread\r\n     itself in Bohemia and Silesia. Every Grand officer of these Orders\r\n     had all his life to wear the Red Cross and to repeat every day the\r\n     prayer of St. Bernard.[254]\r\n\r\nEckert states that the ritual, symbols, and names of the Rose-Croix were\r\nborrowed from the Templars, and that the Order was divided into seven\r\ndegrees, according to the seven days of creation, at the same time\r\nsignifying that their \"principal aim was that of the mysterious, the\r\ninvestigation of Being and of the forces of nature.\"[255]\r\n\r\nThe Rosicrucian Kenneth Mackenzie, in his _Masonic Cyclopædia_, appears\r\nto suggest the same possibility of Templar origin. Under the heading of\r\nRosicrucians he refers enigmatically to an invisible fraternity that has\r\nexisted from very ancient times, as early as the days of the Crusades,\r\n\"bound by solemn obligations of impenetrable secrecy,\" and joining\r\ntogether in work for humanity and to \"glorify the good.\" At various\r\nperiods of history this body has emerged into a sort of temporary light;\r\nbut its true name has never transpired and is only known to the\r\ninnermost adepts and rulers of the society. \"The Rosicrucians of the\r\nsixteenth century finally disappeared and re-entered this invisible\r\nfraternity \"--from which they had presumably emerged. Whether any such\r\nbody really existed or whether the above account is simply an attempt at\r\nmystification devised to excite curiosity, the incredulous may question.\r\nThe writer here observes that it would be indiscreet to say more, but\r\nelsewhere he throws out a hint that may have some bearing on the matter,\r\nfor in his article on the Templars he says that after the suppression of\r\nthe Order it was revived in a more secret form and subsists to the\r\npresent day. This would exactly accord with Mirabeau's statement that\r\nthe Rosicrucians were only the Order of the Templars secretly\r\nperpetuated. Moreover, as we shall see later, according to a legend\r\npreserved by the Royal Order of Scotland, the degree of the Rosy Cross\r\nhad been instituted by that Order in conjunction with the Templars in\r\n1314, and it would certainly be a remarkable coincidence that a man\r\nbearing the name of Rosenkreutz should happen to have inaugurated a\r\nsociety, founded, like the Templars, on Eastern secret doctrines during\r\nthe course of the same century, without any connexion existing between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nI would suggest, then, that Christian Rosenkreutz was a purely mythical\r\npersonage, and that the whole legend concerning his travels was invented\r\nto disguise the real sources whence the Rosicrucians derived their\r\nsystem, which would appear to have been a compound of ancient esoteric\r\ndoctrines, of Arabian and Syrian magic, and of Jewish Cabalism, partly\r\ninherited from the Templars but reinforced by direct contact with\r\nCabalistic Jews in Germany. The Rose-Croix, says Mirabeau, \"were a\r\nmystical, Cabalistic, theological, and magical sect,\" and Rosicrucianism\r\nthus became in the seventeenth century the generic title by which\r\neverything of the nature of Cabalism, Theosophy, Alchemy, Astrology, and\r\nMysticism was designated. For this reason it has been said that they\r\ncannot be regarded as the descendants of the Templars. Mr. Waite, in\r\nreferring to \"the alleged connexion between the Templars and the\r\nBrethren of the Rosy Cross,\" observes:\r\n\r\n     The Templars were not alchemists, they had no scientific\r\n     pretensions, and their secret, so far as it can be ascertained, was\r\n     a religious secret of an anti-Christian kind. The Rosicrucians, on\r\n     the other hand, were pre-eminently a learned society and they were\r\n     also a Christian sect.[256]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Templars do not appear to have practised alchemy is\r\nbeside the point; it is not pretended that the Rosicrucians followed the\r\nTemplars in every particular, but that they were the inheritors of a\r\nsecret tradition passed on to them by the earlier Order. Moreover, that\r\nthey were a learned society, or even a society at all, is not at all\r\ncertain, for they would appear to have possessed no organization like\r\nthe Templars or the Freemasons, but to have consisted rather of isolated\r\noccultists bound together by some tie of secret knowledge concerning\r\nnatural phenomena. This secrecy was no doubt necessary at a period when\r\nscientific research was liable to be regarded as sorcery, but whether\r\nthe Rosicrucians really accomplished anything is extremely doubtful.\r\nThey are said to have been alchemists; but did they ever succeed in\r\ntransmuting metals? They are described as learned, yet do the pamphlets\r\nemanating from the Fraternity betray any proof of superior knowledge?\r\n\"The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosenkreutz,\" which appeared in\r\n1616, certainly appears to be the purest nonsense--magical imaginings of\r\nthe most puerile kind; and Mr. Waite himself observes that the\r\npublication of the _Fama_ and the _Confessio Fraternitalis_ will not add\r\nnew lustre to the Rosicrucian reputations:\r\n\r\n     We are accustomed to regard the adepts of the Rosy Cross as beings\r\n     of sublime elevation and preternatural physical powers, masters of\r\n     Nature, monarchs of the intellectual world.... But here in their\r\n     own acknowledged manifestos they avow themselves a mere\r\n     theosophical offshoot of the Lutheran heresy, acknowledging the\r\n     spiritual supremacy of a temporal prince, and calling the Pope\r\n     anti-Christ.... We find them intemperate in their language, rabid\r\n     in their religious prejudices, and instead of towering giant-like\r\n     above the intellectual average of their age, we see them buffeted\r\n     by the same passions and identified with all opinions of the men by\r\n     whom they were environed. The voice which addresses us behind the\r\n     mystical mask of the Rose-Croix does not come from an intellectual\r\n     throne....\r\n\r\nSo much for the Rosicrucians as a \"learned society.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, of their claim to be a Christian body? The Rosicrucian\r\nstudent of the Cabala, Julius Sperber, in his _Echo of the Divinely\r\nIlluminated Fraternity of the Admirable Order of the R.C._ (1615), has\r\nindicated the place assigned to Christ by the Rosicrucians. In De\r\nQuincey's words:\r\n\r\n     Having maintained the probability of the Rosicrucian pretensions\r\n     on the ground that such _magnalia Dei_ had from the creation\r\n     downwards been confided to the keeping of a few\r\n     individuals--agreeably to which he affirms that Adam was the first\r\n     Rosicrucian of the Old Testament and Simeon the last--he goes on to\r\n     ask whether the Gospel put an end to the secret tradition? By no\r\n     means, he answers: Christ established a new \"college of magic\"\r\n     among His disciples, and the greater mysteries were revealed to St.\r\n     John and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nJohn Yarker, quoting this passage, adds: \"This, Brother Findel points\r\nout, was a claim of the Carpocratian Gnostics\"; it was also, as we have\r\nseen, a part of the Johannite tradition which is said to have been\r\nimparted to the Templars. We shall find the same idea of Christ as an\r\n\"initiate\" running all through the secret societies up to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThese doctrines not unnaturally brought on the Rosicrucians the\r\nsuspicion of being an anti-Christian body. The writer of a contemporary\r\npamphlet published in 1624, declares that \"this fraternity is a\r\nstratagem of the Jews and Cabalistic Hebrews, in whose philosophy, says\r\nPic de la Mirandole, all things are ... as if hidden in the majesty of\r\ntruth or as ... in very sacred Mysteries.\"[257]\r\n\r\nAnother work, _Examination of the Unknown and Novel Cabala of the\r\nBrethren of the Rose-Cross_, agrees with the assertion that the chief of\r\nthis \"execrable college is Satan, that its first rule is denial of God,\r\nblasphemy against the most simple and undivided Trinity, trampling on\r\nthe mysteries of the redemption, spitting in the face of the mother of\r\nGod and of all the saints.\" The sect is further accused of compacts with\r\nthe devil, sacrifices of children, of cherishing toads, making poisonous\r\npowders, dancing with fiends, etc.\r\n\r\nNow, although all this would appear to be quite incompatible with the\r\ncharacter of the Rosicrucians as far as it is known, we have already\r\nseen that the practices here described were by no means imaginary; in\r\nthis same seventeenth century, when the fame of the Rosicrucians was\r\nfirst noised abroad, black magic was still, as in the days of Gilles de\r\nRais, a horrible reality, not only in France but in England, Scotland,\r\nand Germany, where sorcerers of both sexes were continually put to\r\ndeath.[258] However much we may deplore the methods employed against\r\nthese people or question the supernatural origin of their cult, it would\r\nbe idle to deny that the cult itself existed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, towards the end of the century it assumed in France a very\r\ntangible form in the series of mysterious dramas known as the \"Affaire\r\ndes Poisons,\" of which the first act took place in 1666, when the\r\ncelebrated Marquise de Brinvilliers embarked on her amazing career of\r\ncrime in collaboration with her lover Sainte-Croix. This extraordinary\r\nwoman, who for ten years made a hobby of trying the effects of various\r\nslow poisons on her nearest relations, thereby causing the death of her\r\nfather and brothers, might appear to have been merely an isolated\r\ncriminal of the abnormal type but for the sequel to her exploits in the\r\nepidemic of poisoning which followed and during twenty years kept Paris\r\nin a state of terror. The investigations of the police finally led to\r\nthe discovery of a whole band of magicians and alchemists--\"a vast\r\nramification of malefactors covering all France\"--who specialized in\r\nthe art of poisoning without fear of detection.\r\n\r\nConcerning all these sorcerers, alchemists, compounders of magical\r\npowders and philtres, frightful rumours circulated, \"pacts with the\r\ndevil were talked of, sacrifices of new-born babies, incantations,\r\nsacrilegious Masses and other practices as disquieting as they were\r\nlugubrious.\"[259] Even the King's mistress, Madame de Montespan, is\r\nsaid to have had recourse to black Masses in order to retain the royal\r\nfavour through the agency of the celebrated sorceress La Voisin, with\r\nwhom she was later implicated in an accusation of having attempted the\r\nlife of the King.\r\n\r\nAll the extraordinary details of these events have recently been\r\ndescribed in the book of Madame Latour, where the intimate connexion\r\nbetween the poisoners and the magicians is shown. In the opinion of\r\ncontemporaries, these were not isolated individuals:\r\n\r\n     \"Their methods were too certain, their execution of crime too\r\n     skilful and too easy for them not to have belonged, either directly\r\n     or indirectly, to a whole organization of criminals who prepared\r\n     the way, and studied the method of giving to crime the appearance\r\n     of illness, of forming, in a word, a school.\"[260]\r\n\r\nThe author of the work here quoted draws an interesting parallel between\r\nthis organization and the modern traffic in cocaine, and goes on to\r\ndescribe the three degrees into which it was divided: firstly, the\r\nHeads, cultivated and intelligent men, who understood chemistry,\r\nphysics, and nearly all useful sciences, \"invisible counsellors but\r\nsupreme, without whom the sorcerers and diviners would have been\r\npowerless\"; secondly, the visible magicians employing mysterious\r\nprocesses, complicated rites and terrifying ceremonies; and thirdly, the\r\ncrowd of nobles and plebeians who flocked to the doors of the sorcerers\r\nand filled their pockets in return for magic potions, philtres, and, in\r\ncertain cases, insidious poisons. Thus La Voisin must be placed in the\r\nsecond category; \"in spite of her luxury, her profits, and her fame,\"\r\nshe \"is only a subaltern agent in this vast organization of criminals.\r\nShe depends entirely for her great enterprises on the intellectual\r\nchiefs of the corporation....\"[261]\r\n\r\nWho were these intellectual chiefs? The man who first initiated Madame\r\nde Brinvilliers' lover Sainte-Croix into the art of poisoning was an\r\nItalian named Exili or Eggidi; but the real initiate from whom Eggidi\r\nand another Italian poisoner had learnt their secrets is said to have\r\nbeen Glaser, variously described as a German or a Swiss chemist, who\r\nfollowed the principles of Paracelsus and occupied the post of physician\r\nto the King and the Duc d'Orléans.[262] This man, about whose history\r\nlittle is known, might thus have been a kind of Rosicrucian. For since,\r\nas has been said, the intellectual chiefs from whom the poisoners\r\nderived their inspiration were men versed in chemistry, in science, in\r\nphysics, and the treatment of diseases, and since, further, they\r\nincluded alchemists and people professing to be in possession of the\r\nPhilosopher's Stone, their resemblance with the Rosicrucians is at once\r\napparent. Indeed, in turning back to the branches of magic enumerated by\r\nthe Rosicrucian Robert Fludd, we find not only Natural Magic, \"that most\r\noccult and secret department of physics by which the mystical properties\r\nof natural substances are extracted,\" but also Venefic Magic, which \"is\r\nfamiliar with potions, philtres, and with various preparations of\r\npoisons.\"\r\n\r\nThe art of poisoning was therefore known to the Rosicrucians, and,\r\nalthough there is no reason to suppose it was ever practised by the\r\nheads of the Fraternity, it is possible that the inspirers of the\r\npoisoners may have been perverted Rosicrucians, that is to say, students\r\nof those portions of the Cabala relating to magic both of the\r\nnecromantic and venefic varieties, who turned the scientific knowledge\r\nwhich the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross used for healing to a precisely\r\nopposite and deadly purpose. This would explain the fact that\r\ncontemporaries like the author of the _Examination of the Unknown and\r\nNovel Cabala of the Brethren of the Rose-Cross_ should identify these\r\nbrethren with the magicians and believe them to be guilty of practices\r\nderiving from the same source as Rosicrucian knowledge--the Cabala of\r\nthe Jews. Their modern admirers would, of course, declare that they were\r\nthe poles asunder, the difference being between white and black magic.\r\nHuysmans, however, scoffs at this distinction and says the use of the\r\nterm \"white magic\" was a ruse of the Rose-Croix.\r\n\r\nBut of the real doctrines of the Rosicrucians no one can speak with\r\ncertainty. The whole story of the Fraternity is wrapped in mystery.\r\nMystery was avowedly the essence of their system; their identity, their\r\naims, their doctrines, are said to have been kept a profound secret from\r\nthe world. Indeed it is said that no real Rosicrucian ever allowed\r\nhimself to be known as such. As a result of this systematic method of\r\nconcealment, sceptics on the one hand have declared the Rosicrucians to\r\nhave been charlatans and impostors or have denied their very existence,\r\nwhilst on the other hand romancers have exalted them as depositaries of\r\nsupernatural wisdom. The question is further obscured by the fact that\r\nmost accounts of the Fraternity--as, for example, those of Eliphas Lévi,\r\nHargrave Jennings, Kenneth Mackenzie, Mr. A.E. Waite, Dr. Wynn Westcott,\r\nand Mr. Cadbury Jones--are the work of men claiming or believing\r\nthemselves to be initiated into Rosicrucianism or other occult systems\r\nof a kindred nature and as such in possession of peculiar and exclusive\r\nknowledge. This pretension may at once be dismissed as an absurdity;\r\nnothing is easier than for anyone to make a compound out of Jewish\r\nCabalism and Eastern theosophy and to label it Rosicrucianism, but no\r\nproof whatever exists of any affiliation between the self-styled\r\nRosicrucians of to-day and the seventeenth-century \"Brothers of the Rosy\r\nCross.\"[263]\r\n\r\nIn spite of Mr. Wake's claim, \"The Real History of the Rosicrucians\"\r\nstill remains to be written, at any rate in the English language. The\r\nbook he has published under this name is merely a superficial study of\r\nthe question largely composed of reprints of Rosicrucian pamphlets\r\naccessible to any student. Mr. Wigston and Mrs. Pott merely echo Mr.\r\nWaite. Thus everything that has been published hitherto consists in the\r\nrepetition of Rosicrucian legends or in unsubstantiated theorizings on\r\ntheir doctrines. What we need are facts. We want to know who were the\r\nearly Rosicrucians, when the Fraternity originated, and what were its\r\nreal aims. These researches must be made, not by an occultist weaving\r\nhis own theories into the subject, but by a historian free from any\r\nprejudices for or against the Order, capable of weighing evidence and\r\nbringing a judicial mind to bear on the material to be found in the\r\nlibraries of the Continent--notably the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in\r\nParis. Such a work would be a valuable contribution to the history of\r\nsecret societies in our country.\r\n\r\nBut if the Continental Brethren of the Rose-Croix form but a shadowy\r\ngroup of \"Invisibles\" whose identity yet remains a mystery, the English\r\nadepts of the Order stand forth in the light of day as, philosophers\r\nwell known to their age and country. That Francis Bacon was initiated\r\ninto Rosicrucianism is now recognized by Freemasons, but a more definite\r\nlink with the Rosicrucians of the Continent was Robert Fludd, who after\r\ntravelling for six years in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain--where he\r\nformed connexions with Jewish Cabalists[264]--was visited by the German\r\nJew Rosicrucian Michel Maier--doctor to the Emperor Rudolf--by whom he\r\nappears to have been initiated into further mysteries.\r\n\r\nIn 1616 Fludd published his _Tractatus Apologeticus_, defending the\r\nRosicrucians against the charges of \"detestable magic and diabolical\r\nsuperstition\" brought against them by Libavius. Twelve years later Fludd\r\nwas attacked by Father Mersenne, to whom a reply was made \"by Fludd or a\r\nfriend of Fludd's\" containing a further defence of the Order. \"The\r\nBook,\" says Mr. Waite, \"treats of the noble art of magic, the foundation\r\nand nature of the Cabala, the essence of veritable alchemy, and of the\r\nCausa Fratrum Rosae Crucis. It identifies the palace or home of the\r\nRosicrucians with the Scriptural House of Wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nIn further works by English writers the Eastern origin of the Fraternity\r\nis insisted on. Thus Thomas Vaughan, known as Eugenius Philalethes,\r\nwriting in praise of the Rosicrucians in 1652, says that \"their\r\nknowledge at first was not purchased by their own disquisitions, for\r\nthey received it from the Arabians, amongst whom it remained as the\r\nmonument and legacy of the Children of the East. Nor is this at all\r\nimprobable, for the Eastern countries have been always famous for\r\nmagical and secret societies.\"\r\n\r\nAnother apologist of the Rosicrucians, John Heydon, who travelled in\r\nEgypt, Persia, and Arabia, is described by a contemporary as having been\r\nin \"many strange places among the Rosie Crucians and at their castles,\r\nholy houses, temples, sepulchres, sacrifices.\" Heydon himself, whilst\r\ndeclaring that he is not a Rosicrucian, says that he knows members of\r\nthe Fraternity and its secrets, that they are sons of Moses, and that\r\n\"this Rosie Crucian Physick or Medicine, I happily and unexpectedly\r\nalight upon in Arabia.\" These references to castles, temples,\r\nsacrifices, encountered in Egypt, Persia, and Arabia inevitably recall\r\nmemories of both Templars and Ismailis. Is there no connexion between\r\n\"the Invisible Mountains of the Brethren\" referred to elsewhere by\r\nHeydon and the Mountains of the Assassins and the Freemasons? between\r\nthe Scriptural \"House of Wisdom\" and the Dar-ul-Hikmat or Grand Lodge of\r\nCairo, the model for Western masonic lodges?\r\n\r\nIt is as the precursors of the crisis which arose in 1717 that the\r\nEnglish Rosicrucians of the seventeenth century are of supreme\r\nimportance. No longer need we concern ourselves with shadowy Brethren\r\nlaying dubious claim to supernatural wisdom, but with a concrete\r\nassociation of professed Initiates proclaiming their existence to the\r\nworld under the name of Freemasonry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The origin of Freemasonry,\" says a masonic writer of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, \"is known to Freemasons alone.\"[265] If this was once the\r\ncase, it is so no longer, for, although the question would certainly\r\nappear to be one on which the initiated should be most qualified to\r\nspeak, the fact is that no official theory on the origin of Freemasonry\r\nexists; the great mass of the Freemasons do _not_ know or care to know\r\nanything about the history of their Order, whilst Masonic authorities\r\nare entirely disagreed on the matter. Dr. Mackey admits that \"the origin\r\nand source whence first sprang the institution of Freemasonry has given\r\nrise to more difference of opinion and discussion among masonic scholars\r\nthan any other topic in the literature of the institution.\"[266] Nor is\r\nthis ignorance maintained merely in books for the general public, since\r\nin those specially addressed to the Craft and at discussions in lodges\r\nthe same diversity of opinion prevails, and no decisive conclusions\r\nappear to be reached. Thus Mr. Albert Churchward, a Freemason of the\r\nthirtieth degree, who deplores the small amount of interest taken in\r\nthis matter by Masons in general, observes:\r\n\r\nHitherto there have been so many contradictory opinions and theories in\r\nthe attempt to supply the origin and the reason whence, where, and why\r\nthe Brotherhood of Freemasonry came into existence, and all the\r\n\"different parts\" and various rituals of the \"different degrees.\" All\r\nthat has been written on this has hitherto been _theories_, without any\r\nfacts for their fundation.[267]\r\n\r\nIn the absence, therefore, of any origin universally recognized by the\r\nCraft, it is surely open to the lay mind to speculate on the matter and\r\nto draw conclusions from history as to which of the many explanations\r\nput forward seems to supply the key to the mystery.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Royal Masonic Cyclopædia_, no less than twelve\r\ntheories have been advanced as to the origins of the Order, namely, that\r\nMasonry derived:\r\n\r\n\"(1) From the patriarchs. (2) From the mysteries of the pagans. (3) From\r\nthe construction of Solomon's Temple, (4) From the Crusades. (5) From\r\nthe Knights Templar. (6) From the Roman Collegia of Artificers. (7) From\r\nthe operative masons of the Middle Ages. (8) From the Rosicrucians of\r\nthe sixteenth century. (9) From Oliver Cromwell. (10) From Prince\r\nCharles Stuart for political purposes. (11) From Sir Christopher Wren,\r\nat the building of St. Paul's. (12) From Dr. Desaguliers and his friends\r\nin 1717.\"\r\n\r\nThis enumeration is, however, misleading, for it implies that in _one_\r\nof these various theories the true origin of Freemasonry may be found.\r\nIn reality modern Freemasonry is a dual system, a blend of two distinct\r\ntraditions--of operative masonry, that is to say the actual art of\r\nbuilding, and of speculative theory on the great truths of life and\r\ndeath. As a well-known Freemason, the Count Goblet d'Alviella, has\r\nexpressed it: \"Speculative Masonry\" (that is to say, the dual system we\r\nnow know as Freemasonry) \"is the legitimate offspring of a fruitful\r\nunion between the professional guild of mediæval Masons and of a secret\r\ngroup of philosophical Adepts, the first having furnished the form and\r\nthe second the spirit.\"[268] In studying the origins of the present\r\nsystem we have therefore (1) to examine separately the history of each\r\nof these two traditions, and (2) to discover their point of junction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOperative Masonry\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning with the first of these two traditions, we find that guilds of\r\nworking masons existed in very ancient times. Without going back as far\r\nas ancient Egypt or Greece, which would be beyond the scope of the\r\npresent work, the course of these associations may be traced throughout\r\nthe history of Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era.\r\nAccording to certain masonic writers, the Druids originally came from\r\nEgypt and brought with them traditions relating to the art of building.\r\nThe _Culdees_, who later on established schools and colleges in this\r\ncountry for the teaching of arts, sciences, and handicrafts, are said\r\nto have derived from the Druids.\r\n\r\nBut a more probable source of inspiration in the art of building are the\r\nRomans, who established the famous collegia of architects referred to in\r\nthe list of alternative theories given in the _Masonic Cyclopædia_.\r\nAdvocates of the Roman Collegia origin of Freemasonry might be right as\r\nfar as operative masonry is concerned, for it is to the period following\r\non the Roman occupation of Britain that our masonic guilds can with the\r\ngreatest degree of certainty be traced. Owing to the importance the art\r\nof building now acquired it is said that many distinguished men, such as\r\nSt. Alban, King Alfred, King Edwin, and King Athelstan, were numbered\r\namongst its patrons,[269] so that in time the guilds came to occupy the\r\nposition of privileged bodies and were known as \"free corporations\";\r\nfurther that York was the first masonic centre in England, largely under\r\nthe control of the Culdees, who at the same period exercised much\r\ninfluence over the Masonic Collegia in Scotland, at Kilwinning, Melrose,\r\nand Aberdeen.[270]\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that all this is speculation. No documentary\r\nevidence has ever been produced to prove the existence of masonic guilds\r\nbefore the famous York charter of A.D. 936, and even the date of this\r\ndocument is doubtful. Only with the period of Gothic architecture do we\r\nreach firm ground. That guilds of working masons known in France as\r\n\"Compagnonnages\" and in Germany as \"Steinmetzen\" did then form close\r\ncorporations and possibly possess secrets connected with their\r\nprofession is more than probable. That, in consequence of their skill in\r\nbuilding the magnificent cathedrals of this period, they now came to\r\noccupy a privileged position seems fairly certain.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Grandidier, writing from Strasbourg in 1778, traces the whole\r\nsystem of Freemasonry from these German guilds: \"This much-vaunted\r\nSociety of Freemasons is nothing but a servile imitation of an ancient\r\nand useful _confrèrie_ of real masons whose headquarters was formerly at\r\nStrasbourg and of which the constitution was confirmed by the Emperor\r\nMaximilian in 1498.\"[271]\r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible to discover from the scanty documentary\r\nevidence the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries provide,\r\nthe same privileges appear to have been accorded to the guilds of\r\nworking masons in England and Scotland, which, although presided over by\r\npowerful nobles and apparently on occasion admitting members from\r\noutside the Craft, remained essentially operative bodies. Nevertheless\r\nwe find the assemblies of Masons suppressed by Act of Parliament in the\r\nbeginning of the reign of Henry VI, and later on an armed force sent by\r\nQueen Elizabeth to break up the Annual Grand Lodge at York. It is\r\npossible that the fraternity merely by the secrecy with which it was\r\nsurrounded excited the suspicions of authority, for nothing could be\r\nmore law-abiding than its published statutes. Masons were to be \"true\r\nmen to God and the Holy Church,\" also to the masters that they served.\r\nThey were to be honest in their manner of life and \"to do no villainy\r\nwhereby the Craft or the Science may be slandered.\"[272]\r\n\r\nYet the seventeenth-century writer Plot, in his _Natural History of\r\nStaffordshire_, expresses some suspicion with regard to the secrets of\r\nFreemasonry. That these could not be merely trade secrets relating to\r\nthe art of building, but that already some speculative element had been\r\nintroduced to the lodges, seems the more probable from the fact that by\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century not only noble patrons headed the\r\nCraft, but ordinary gentlemen entirely unconnected with building were\r\nreceived into the fraternity. The well-known entry in the diary of Elias\r\nAshmole under the date of October 16, 1646, clearly proves this fact: \"I\r\nwas made a Freemason at Warrington in Lancashire with Col. Henry\r\nMainwaring of Karticham [?] in Cheshire. The names of those that were\r\nthen of the Lodge, Mr. Rich. Penket, Warden, Mr. James Collier, Mr.\r\nRich. Sankey, Henry Littler, John Ellam, Rich. Ellam and Hugh Brewer.\"[273]\r\n\"It is now ascertained,\" says Yarker, \"that the majority of the\r\nmembers present were not operative masons.\"[274]\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1682 Ashmole relates that he attended a meeting held at Mason\r\nHall in London, where with a number of other gentlemen he was admitted\r\ninto \"the Fellowship of the Freemasons,\" that is to say, into the second\r\ndegree. We have then clear proof that already in the seventeenth century\r\nFreemasonry had ceased to be an association composed exclusively of men\r\nconcerned with building, although eminent architects ranked high in the\r\nOrder; Inigo Jones is said to have been Grand Master under James I, and\r\nSir Christopher Wren to have occupied the same position from about 1685\r\nto 1702. But it was not until 1703 that the Lodge of St. Paul in London\r\nofficially announced \"that the privileges of Masonry should no longer be\r\nrestricted to operative Masons, but extended to men of various\r\nprofessions, provided they were regularly approved and initiated into\r\nthe Order.\"[275]\r\n\r\nThis was followed in 1717 by the great _coup d'état_ when Grand Lodge\r\nwas founded, and Speculative Masonry, which we now know as Freemasonry,\r\nwas established on a settled basis with a ritual, rules, and\r\nconstitution drawn up in due form. It is at this important date that the\r\nofficial history of Freemasonry begins.\r\n\r\nBut before pursuing the course of the Order through what is known as the\r\n\"Grand Lodge Era,\" it is necessary to go back and enquire into the\r\norigins of the philosophy that was now combined with the system of\r\noperative masonry. This is the point on which opinions are divided and\r\nto which the various theories summarized in the _Masonic Cyclopcædia_\r\nrelate. Let us examine each of these in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeculative Masonry\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to certain sceptics concerning the mysteries of Freemasonry,\r\nthe system inaugurated in 1717 had no existence before that date, but\r\n\"was devised, promulgated, and palmed upon the world by Dr. Desaguliers,\r\nDr. Anderson, and others, who then founded the Grand Lodge of England.\"\r\nMr. Paton, in an admirable little pamphlet,[276] has shown the futility\r\nof this contention and also the injustice of representing the founders\r\nof Grand Lodge as perpetrating so gross a deception.\r\n\r\n     This 1717 theory ascribes to men of the highest character the\r\n     invention of a system of mere imposture.... It was brought forward\r\n     with pretensions which its framers knew to be false pretensions of\r\n     high antiquity; whereas ... it had newly been invented in their\r\n     studies. Is this likely? Or is it reasonable to ascribe such\r\n     conduct to honourable men, without even assigning a probable motive\r\n     for it?\r\n\r\nWe have indeed only to study masonic ritual--which is open to everyone\r\nto read--in order to arrive at the same conclusion, that there could be\r\nno motive for this imposture, and further that these two clergymen\r\ncannot be supposed to have evolved the whole thing out of their heads.\r\nObviously some movement of a kindred nature must have led up to this\r\ncrisis. And since Elias Ashmole's diary clearly proves that a ceremony\r\nof masonic initiation had existed in the preceding century, it is surely\r\nonly reasonable to conclude that Drs. Anderson and Desaguliers revised\r\nbut did not originate the ritual and constitutions drawn up by them.\r\n\r\nNow, although the ritual of Freemasonry is couched in modern and by no\r\nmeans classical English, the ideas running through it certainly bear\r\ntraces of extreme antiquity. The central idea of Freemasonry concerning\r\na loss which has befallen man and the hope of its ultimate recovery is\r\nin fact no other than the ancient secret tradition described in the\r\nfirst chapter of this book. Certain masonic writers indeed ascribe to\r\nFreemasonry precisely the same genealogy as that of the early Cabala,\r\ndeclaring that it descended from Adam and the first patriarchs of the\r\nhuman race, and thence through groups of Wise Men amongst the Egyptians,\r\nChaldeans, Persians, and Greeks.[277] Mr. Albert Churchward insists\r\nparticularly on the Egyptian origin of the speculative element in\r\nFreemasonry: \"Brother Gould and other Freemasons will never understand\r\nthe meaning and origin of our sacred tenets till they have studied and\r\nunlocked the mysteries of the past.\" This study will then reveal the\r\nfact that \"the Druids, the Gymnosophists of India, the Magi of Persia,\r\nand the Chaldeans of Assyria had all the same religious rites and\r\nceremonies as practised by their priests who were initiated to their\r\nOrder, and that these were solemnly sworn to keep the doctrines a\r\nprofound secret from the rest of mankind. All these flowed from one\r\nsource--Egypt.\"[278]\r\n\r\nMr. Churchward further quotes the speech of the Rev. Dr. William Dodd at\r\nthe opening of a masonic temple in 1794, who traced Freemasonry from\r\n\"the first astronomers on the plains of Chaldea, the wise and mystic\r\nkings and priests of Egypt, the sages of Greece and philosophers of\r\nRome,\" etc.[279]\r\n\r\nBut how did these traditions descend to the masons of the West?\r\nAccording to a large body of masonic opinion in this country which\r\nrecognizes only a single source of inspiration to the system we now know\r\nas Freemasonry, the speculative as well as the operative traditions of\r\nthe Order descended from the building guilds and were imported to\r\nEngland by means of the Roman Collegia. Mr. Churchward, however,\r\nstrongly dissents from this view:\r\n\r\n     In the new and revised edition of the Perfect Ceremonies, according\r\n     to our E. working, a theory is given that Freemasonry originated\r\n     from certain guilds of workmen which are well known in history as\r\n     the \"Roman College of Artificers.\" There is no foundation of fact\r\n     for such a theory. Freemasonry is now, and always was, an\r\n     Eschatology, as may be proved by the whole of our signs, symbols,\r\n     and words, and our rituals.[280]\r\n\r\nBut what Mr. Churchward fails to explain is how this eschatology reached\r\nthe working masons; moreover why, if as he asserts, it derived from\r\nEgypt, Assyria, India, and Persia, Freemasonry no longer bears the stamp\r\nof these countries. For although vestiges of Sabeism may be found in the\r\ndecoration of the lodges, and brief references to the mysteries of Egypt\r\nand Phœnicia, to the secret teaching of Pythagoras, to Euclid, and to\r\nPlato in the Ritual and instructions of the Craft degrees--nevertheless\r\nthe form in which the ancient tradition is clothed, the phraseology and\r\npass-words employed, are neither Egyptian, Chaldean, Greek, nor Persian,\r\nbut Judaic. Thus although some portion of the ancient secret tradition\r\nmay have penetrated to Great Britain through the Druids or the\r\nRomans--versed in the lore of Greece and Egypt--another channel for its\r\nintroduction was clearly the Cabala of the Jews. Certain masonic writers\r\nrecognize this double tradition, the one descending from Egypt, Chaldea,\r\nand Greece, the other from the Israelites, and assert that it is from\r\nthe latter source their system is derived.[281] For after tracing its\r\norigin from Adam, Noah, Enoch, and Abraham, they proceed to show its\r\nline of descent through Moses, David, and Solomon[282]--descent from\r\nSolomon is in fact officially recognized by the Craft and forms a part\r\nof the instructions to candidates for initiation into the first degree.\r\nBut, as we have already seen, this is the precise genealogy attributed\r\nto the Cabala by the Jews. Moreover, modern Freemasonry is entirely\r\nbuilt up on the Solomonic, or rather the Hiramic legend. For the sake of\r\nreaders unfamiliar with the ritual of Freemasonry a brief _résumé_ of\r\nthis \"Grand Legend\" must be given here.\r\n\r\nSolomon, when building the Temple, employed the services of a certain\r\nartificer in brass, named Hiram, the son of a widow of the tribe of\r\nNaphthali, who was sent to him by Hiram, King of Tyre. So much we know\r\nfrom the Book of Kings, but the masonic legend goes on to relate that\r\nHiram, the widow's son, referred to as Hiram Abiff, and described as the\r\nmaster-builder, met with an untimely end. For the purpose of preserving\r\norder the masons working on the Temple were divided into three classes,\r\nEntered Apprentices, Fellow Crafts, and Master Masons, the first two\r\ndistinguished by different pass-words and grips and paid at different\r\nrates of wages, the last consisting only of three persons--Solomon\r\nhimself, Hiram King of Tyre, who had provided him with wood and precious\r\nstones and Hiram Abiff. Now, before the completion of the Temple fifteen\r\nof the Fellow Crafts conspired together to find out the secrets of the\r\nMaster Masons and resolved to waylay Hiram Abiff at the door of the\r\nTemple.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment twelve of the fifteen drew back, but the remaining\r\nthree carried out the fell design, and after threatening Hiram in vain\r\nin order to obtain the secrets, killed him with three blows on the head,\r\ndelivered by each in turn. They then conveyed the body away and buried\r\nit on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. Solomon, informed of the disappearance\r\nof the master-builder, sent out fifteen Fellow Crafts to seek for him;\r\nfive of these, having arrived at the mountain, noticed a place where the\r\nearth had been disturbed and there discovered the body of Hiram. Leaving\r\na branch of acacia to mark the spot, they returned with their story to\r\nSolomon, who ordered them to go and exhume the body--an order that was\r\nimmediately carried out.\r\n\r\nThe murder and exhumation, or \"raising,\" of Hiram, accompanied by\r\nextraordinary lamentations, form the climax of Craft Masonry; and when\r\nit is remembered that in all probability no such, tragedy ever took\r\nplace, that possibly no one known as Hiram Abiff ever existed,[283] the\r\nwhole story can only be regarded as the survival of some ancient cult\r\nrelating not to an actual event, but to an esoteric doctrine. A legend\r\nand a ceremony of this kind is indeed to be found in many earlier\r\nmythologies; the story of the murder of Hiram had been foreshadowed by\r\nthe Egyptian legend of the murder of Osiris and the quest for his body\r\nby Isis, whilst the lamentations around the tomb of Hiram had a\r\ncounterpart in the mourning ceremonies for Osiris and Adonis--both, like\r\nHiram, subsequently \"raised\"--and later on in that which took place\r\naround the catafalque of Manes, who, like Hiram, was barbarously put to\r\ndeath and is said to have been known to the Manicheans as \"the son of\r\nthe widow.\" But in the form given to it by Freemasonry the legend is\r\npurely Judaic, and would therefore appear to have derived from the\r\nJudaic version of the ancient tradition. The pillars of the Temple,\r\nJachin and Boaz, which play so important a part in Craft Masonry, are\r\nsymbols which occur in the Jewish Cabala, where they are described as\r\ntwo of the ten Sephiroths.[284] A writer of the eighteenth century,\r\nreferring to \"fyve curiosities\" he has discovered in Scotland, describes\r\none as--\r\n\r\n     The Mason word, which tho' some make a Misterie of it, I will not\r\n     conceal a little of what I know. It is lyke a Rabbinical Tradition\r\n     in way of Comment on Jachin and Boaz, the Two Pillars erected in\r\n     Solomon's Temple with ane Addition delyvered from Hand to Hand, by\r\n     which they know and become familiar one with another.[285]\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the system by which the Cabala was handed down amongst\r\nthe Jews. The _Jewish Encyclopædia_ lends colour to the theory of\r\nCabalistic transmission by suggesting that the story of Hiram \"may\r\npossibly trace back to the Rabbinic legend concerning the Temple of\r\nSolomon,\" that \"while all the workmen were killed so that they should\r\nnot build another temple devoted to idolatry, Hiram himself was raised\r\nto Heaven like Enoch.\"[286]\r\n\r\nHow did this Rabbinic legend find its way into Freemasonry? Advocates of\r\nthe Roman Collegia theory explain it in the following manner.\r\n\r\nAfter the building of the Temple of Solomon the masons who had been\r\nengaged in the work were dispersed and a number made their way to\r\nEurope, some to Marseilles, some perhaps to Rome, where they may have\r\nintroduced Judaic legends to the Collegia, which then passed on to the\r\nComacini Masters of the seventh century and from these to the mediæval\r\nworking guilds of England, France, and Germany. It is said that during\r\nthe Middle Ages a story concerning the Temple of Solomon was current\r\namongst the _compagnonnages_ of France. In one of these groups, known as\r\n\"the children of Solomon,\" the legend of Hiram appears to have existed\r\nmuch in its present form; according to another group the victim of the\r\nmurder was not Hiram Abiff, but one of his companions named Maître\r\nJacques, who, whilst engaged with Hiram on the construction of the\r\nTemple, met his death at the hands of five wicked Fellow Crafts,\r\ninstigated by a sixth, the Père Soubise.[287]\r\n\r\nBut the date at which this legend originated is unknown. Clavel thinks\r\nthat the \"Hebraic mysteries\" existed as early as the Roman Collegia,\r\nwhich he describes as largely Judaized[288]; Yarker expresses precisely\r\nthe opposite view: \"It is not so difficult to connect Freemasonry with\r\nthe Collegia; the difficulty lies in attributing Jewish traditions to\r\nthe Collegia, and we say on the evidence of the oldest charges that such\r\ntraditions had no existence in Saxon times.\"[289] Again: \"So far as\r\nthis country is concerned, we know nothing from documents of a Masonry\r\ndating from Solomon's Temple until after the Crusades, when the\r\nconstitution believed to have been sanctioned by King Athelstan\r\ngradually underwent a change.\"[290] In a discussion which took place\r\nrecently at the Quatuor Coronati Lodge the Hiramic legend could only be\r\ntraced back--and then without absolute certainty--to the fourteenth\r\ncentury, which would coincide with the date indicated by Yarker.[291]\r\n\r\nUp to this period the lore of the masonic guilds appears to have\r\ncontained only the exoteric doctrines of Egypt and Greece--which may\r\nhave reached them through the Roman Collegia, whilst the traditions of\r\nMasonry are traced from Adam, Jabal, Tubal Cain, from Nimrod and the\r\nTower of Babel, with Hermes and Pythagoras as their more immediate\r\nprogenitors.[292] These doctrines were evidently in the main geometrical\r\nor technical, and in no sense Cabalistic. There is therefore some\r\njustification for Eckert's statement that \"the Judeo-Christian mysteries\r\nwere not yet introduced into the masonic corporations; nowhere can we\r\nfind the least trace of them. Nowhere do we find any classification, not\r\neven that of masters, fellow-crafts, and apprentices. We observe no\r\nsymbol of the Temple of Solomon; all their symbolism relates to masonic\r\nlabours and to a few philosophical maxims of morality.\"[293] The date\r\nat which Eckert, like Yarker, places the introduction of these Judaic\r\nelements is the time of the Crusades.\r\n\r\nBut whilst recognizing that modern Craft Masonry is largely founded on\r\nthe Cabala, it is necessary to distinguish between the different\r\nCabalas. For by this date no less than three Cabalas appear to have\r\nexisted: firstly, the ancient secret tradition of the patriarchs handed\r\ndown from the Egyptians through the Greeks and Romans, and possibly\r\nthrough the Roman Collegia to the Craft Masons of Britain; secondly, the\r\nJewish version of this tradition, the first Cabala of the Jews, in no\r\nway incompatible with Christianity, descending from Moses, David and\r\nSolomon to the Essenes and the more enlightened Jews; and thirdly, the\r\nperverted Cabala, mingled by the Rabbis with magic, barbaric\r\nsuperstitions, and--after the death of Christ--with anti-Christian\r\nlegends.\r\n\r\nWhatever Cabalistic elements were introduced into Craft Masonry at the\r\ntime of the Crusades appear to have belonged to the second of these\r\ntraditions, the unperverted Cabala of the Jews, known to the Essenes.\r\nThere are, in fact, striking resemblances betwen Freemasonry and\r\nEssenism--degrees of initiation, oaths of secrecy, the wearing of the\r\napron, and a certain masonic sign; whilst to the Sabeist traditions of\r\nthe Essenes may perhaps be traced the solar and stellar symbolism of the\r\nlodges.[294] The Hiramic legend may have belonged to the same tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Templar Tradition\r\n\r\n\r\nIf then no documentary evidence can be brought forward to show that\r\neither the Solomonic legend or any traces of Judaic symbolism and\r\ntraditions existed either in the monuments of the period or in the\r\nritual of the masons before the fourteenth century, it is surely\r\nreasonable to recognize the plausibility of the contention put forward\r\nby a great number of masonic writers--particularly on the\r\nContinent--that the Judaic elements penetrated into Masonry by means of\r\nthe Templars.[295] The Templars, as we have already seen, had taken\r\ntheir name from the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. What then more\r\nlikely than that during the time they had lived there they had learnt\r\nthe Rabbinical legends connected with the Temple? According to George\r\nSand, who was deeply versed in the history of secret societies, the\r\nHiramic legend was adopted by the Templars as symbolic of the\r\ndestruction of their Order. \"They wept over their impotence in the\r\nperson of Hiram. The word lost and recovered is their empire....\"[296]\r\nThe Freemason Ragon likewise declares that the catastrophe they lamented\r\nwas the catastrophe that destroyed their Order.[297] Further, the Grand\r\nMaster whose fate they deplored was Jacques du Molay. Here then we have\r\ntwo bodies in France at the same period, the Templars and the\r\n_compagnonnages_, both possessing a legend concerning the Temple of\r\nSolomon and both mourning a Maître Jacques who had been barbarously put\r\nto death. If we accept the possibility that the Hiramic legend existed\r\namongst the masons before the Crusades, how are we to explain this\r\nextraordinary coincidence? It is certainly easier to believe that the\r\nJudaic traditions were introduced to the masons by the Templars and\r\ngrafted on to the ancient lore that the masonic guilds had inherited\r\nfrom the Roman Collegia.\r\n\r\nThat some connexion existed between the Templars and the working masons\r\nis indicated by the new influence that entered into building at this\r\nperiod. A modern Freemason comparing \"the beautifully designed and\r\ndeep-cut marks of the true Gothic period, say circa 1150-1350,\" with\r\n\"the careless and roughly executed marks, many of them mere scratches,\r\nof later periods,\" points out that \"the Knights Templars rose and fell\r\nwith that wonderful development of architecture.\" The same writer goes\r\non to show that some of the most important masonic symbols, the\r\nequilateral triangle and the Mason's square surmounting two pillars,\r\ncame through from Gothic times.[298] Yarker asserts that the level, the\r\nflaming star, and the Tau cross which have since passed into the\r\nsymbolism of Freemasonry may be traced to the Knights Templar, as also\r\nthe five-pointed star in Salisbury Cathedral, the double triangle in\r\nWestminster Abbey, Jachin and Boaz, the circle and the pentagon in the\r\nmasonry of the fourteenth century. Yarker cites later, in 1556, the eye\r\nand crescent moon, the three stars and the ladder of five steps, as\r\nfurther evidences of Templar influence.[299] \"The Templars were large\r\nbuilders, and Jacques du Molay alleged the zeal of his Order in\r\ndecorating churches in the process against him in 1310; hence the\r\nalleged connexion of Templary and Freemasonry is bound to have a\r\nsubstratum of truth.\"[300]\r\n\r\nMoreover, according to a masonic tradition, an alliance definitely took\r\nplace between the Templars and the masonic guilds at this period. During\r\nthe proceedings taken against the Order of the Temple in France it is\r\nsaid that Pierre d'Aumont and seven other Knights escaped to Scotland in\r\nthe guise of working masons and landed in the Island of Mull. On St.\r\nJohn's Day, 1307, they held their first chapter. Robert Bruce then took\r\nthem under his protection, and seven years later they fought under his\r\nstandard at Bannockburn against Edward II, who had suppressed their\r\nOrder in England. After this battle, which took place on St. John the\r\nBaptist's Day in summer (June 24), Robert Bruce is said to have\r\ninstituted the Royal Order of H.R.M. (Heredom) and Knights of the\r\nR.S.Y.C.S. (Rosy Cross).[301] These two degrees now constitute the Royal\r\nOrder of Scotland, and it seems not improbable that in reality they were\r\nbrought to Scotland by the Templars. Thus, according to one of the early\r\nwriters on Freemasonry, the degree of the Rose-Croix originated with the\r\nTemplars in Palestine as early as 1188[302]; whilst the Eastern origin\r\nof the word Heredom, supposed to derive from a mythical mountain on an\r\nisland south of the Hebrides[303] where the Culdees practised their\r\nrites, is indicated by another eighteenth-century writer, who traces it\r\nto a Jewish source.[304] In this same year of 1314 Robert Bruce is said\r\nto have united the Templars and the Royal Order of H.R.M. with the\r\nguilds of working masons, who had also fought in his army, at the famous\r\nLodge of Kilwinning, founded in 1286,[305] which now added to its name\r\nthat of Heredom and became the chief seat of the Order.[306] Scotland\r\nwas essentially a home of operative masonry, and, in view of the\r\nTemplar's prowess in the art of building, what more natural than that\r\nthe two bodies should enter into an alliance? Already in England the\r\nTemple is said between 1155 and 1199 to have administered the\r\nCraft.[307] It is thus at Heredom of Kilwinning, \"the Holy House of\r\nMasonry\"--\"Mother Kilwinning,\" as it is still known to Freemasons--that\r\na speculative element of a fresh kind may have found its way into the\r\nlodges. Is it not here, then, that we may see that \"fruitful union\r\nbetween the professional guild of mediæval masons and a secret group of\r\nphilosophical Adepts\" alluded to by Count Goblet d'Aviella and described\r\nby Mr. Waite in the following words:\r\n\r\n     The mystery of the building guilds--whatever it may be held to have\r\n     been--was that of a simple, unpolished, pious, and utilitarian\r\n     device; and this daughter of Nature, in the absence of all\r\n     intention on her own part, underwent, or was coerced into one of\r\n     the strangest marriages which has been celebrated in occult\r\n     history. It so happened that her particular form and figure lent\r\n     itself to such a union, etc.[308]?\r\n\r\nMr. Waite with his usual vagueness does not explain when and where this\r\nmarriage took place, but the account would certainly apply to the\r\nalliance between the Templars and Scottish guilds of working masons,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, is admitted by masonic authorities, and presents\r\nexactly the conditions described, the Templars being peculiarly fitted\r\nby their initiation into the legend concerning the building of the\r\nTemple of Solomon to co-operate with the masons, and the masons being\r\nprepared by their partial initiation into ancient mysteries to receive\r\nthe fresh influx of Eastern tradition from the Templars.\r\n\r\nA further indication of the Templar influence in Craft Masonry is the\r\nsystem of degrees and initiations. The names of Entered Apprentice,\r\nFellow Craft, and Master Mason are said to have derived from\r\nScotland,[309] and the analogy between these and the degrees of the\r\nAssassins has already been shown. Indeed, the resemblance between the\r\nouter organization of Freemasonry and the system of the Ismailis is\r\nshown by many writers. Thus Dr. Bussell observes: \"No doubt together\r\nwith some knowledge of geometry regarded as an esoteric trade secret,\r\nmany symbols to-day current did pass down from very primitive times. But\r\na more certain model was the Grand Lodge of the Ismailis in Cairo\"--that\r\nis to say the Dar-ul-Hikmat.[310] Syed Ameer Ali also expresses the\r\nopinion that \"Makrisi's account of the different degrees of initiation\r\nadopted in this lodge forms an invaluable record of Freemasonry. In\r\nfact, the lodge at Cairo became the model of all the Lodges created\r\nafterwards in Christendom.\"[311] Mr. Bernard Springett, a Freemason,\r\nquoting this passage, adds: \"In this last assertion I am myself greatly\r\nin agreement.\"[312]\r\n\r\nIt is surely therefore legitimate to surmise that this system penetrated\r\nto Craft Masonry through the Templars, whose connexion with the\r\nAssassins--offshoot of the Dar-ul-Hikmat--was a matter of common\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Templar succession in Freemasonry forms perhaps the\r\nmost controversial point in the whole history of the Roman Collegia\r\ntheory, Continental Masons more generally accepting it, and even\r\nglorying in it.[313] Mackey, in his _Lexicon of Freemasonry_, thus sums\r\nup the matter:\r\n\r\n     The connexion between the Knights Templar and the Freemasons has\r\n     been repeatedly asserted by the enemies of both institutions, and\r\n     has often been admitted by their friends. Lawrie, on this subject,\r\n     holds the following language: \"We know that the Knights Templar not\r\n     only possessed the mysteries but performed the ceremonies and\r\n     inculcated the duties of Freemasons,\" and he attributes the\r\n     dissolution of the Order to the discovery of their being Freemasons\r\n     and their assembling in secret to practise the rites of the\r\n     Order.[314]\r\n\r\nThis explains why Freemasons have always shown indulgence to the\r\nTemplars.\r\n\r\n     It was above all Freemasonry [says Findel], which--because it\r\n     falsely held itself to be a daughter of Templarism--took the\r\n     greatest pains to represent the Order of the Templars as innocent\r\n     and therefore free from all mystery. For this purpose not only\r\n     legends and unhistorical facts were brought forward, but\r\n     manœuvres were also resorted to in order to suppress the truth.\r\n     The masonic reverers of the Temple Order bought up the whole\r\n     edition of the _Actes du Procès_ of Moldenhawer, because this\r\n     showed the guilt of the Order; only a few copies reached the\r\n     booksellers.... Already several decades before ... the Freemasons\r\n     in their unhistorical efforts had been guilty of real forgery.\r\n     Dupuy had published his _History of the Trial of the Templars_ as\r\n     early as 1654 in Paris, for which he had made use of the original\r\n     of the _Actes du Procès_, according to which the guilt of the Order\r\n     leaves no room for doubt.... But when in the middle of the\r\n     eighteenth century several branches of Freemasonry wished to recall\r\n     the Templar Order into being, the work of Dupuy was naturally very\r\n     displeasing. It had already been current amongst the public for a\r\n     hundred years, so it could no longer be bought; therefore they\r\n     falsified it.[315]\r\n\r\nAccordingly in 1751 a reprint of Dupuy's work appeared with the addition\r\nof a number of notes and remarks and mutilated in such a way as to prove\r\nnot the guilt but the innocence of the Templars.\r\n\r\nNow, although British Masonry has played no part in these intrigues, the\r\nquestion of the Templar succession has been very inadequately dealt with\r\nby the masonic writers of our country. As a rule they have adopted one\r\nof two courses--either they have persistently denied connexion with the\r\nTemplars or they have represented them as a blameless and cruelly\r\nmaligned Order. But in reality neither of these expedients is necessary\r\nto save the honour of British Masonry, for not even the bitterest enemy\r\nof Masonry has ever suggested that British masons have adopted any\r\nportion of the Templar heresy. The Knights who fled to Scotland may have\r\nbeen perfectly innocent of the charges brought against their Order;\r\nindeed, there is good reason to believe this was the case. Thus the\r\n_Manuel des Chevaliers de l'Ordre du Temple_ relates the incident in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n     After the death of Jacques du Molay, some Scottish Templars having\r\n     become apostates, at the instigation of Robert Bruce ranged\r\n     themselves under the banners of a new Order[316] instituted by this\r\n     prince and in which the receptions were based on those of the Order\r\n     of the Temple. It is there that we must seek the origin of Scottish\r\n     Masonry and even that of the other masonic rites. The Scottish\r\n     Templars were excommunicated in 1324 by Larmenius, who declared\r\n     them to be _Templi desertores_ and the Knights of St. John of\r\n     Jerusalem, _Dominiorum Militiæ spoliatores_, placed for ever\r\n     outside the pale of the Temple: _Extra girum Templi, nunc et in\r\n     futurum, volo, dico et jubeo._ A similar anathema has since been\r\n     launched by several Grand Masters against Templars who were\r\n     rebellious to legitimate authority. From the schism that was\r\n     introduced into Scotland a number of sects took birth.[317]\r\n\r\nThis account forms a complete exoneration of the Scottish Templars; as\r\napostates from the bogus Christian Church and the doctrines of Johannism\r\nthey showed themselves loyal to the true Church and to the Christian\r\nfaith as formulated in the published statutes of their Order. What they\r\nappear, then, to have introduced to Masonry was their manner of\r\nreception, that is to say their outer forms and organization, and\r\npossibly certain Eastern esoteric doctrines and Judaic legends\r\nconcerning the building of the Temple of Solomon in no way incompatible\r\nwith the teaching of Christianity.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed, moreover, that in the ban passed by the _Ordre du\r\nTemple_ on the Scottish Templars the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem\r\nare also included. This is a further tribute to the orthodoxy of the\r\nScottish Knights. For to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem--to whom\r\nthe Templar property was given--no suspicion of heresy had ever\r\nattached. After the suppression of the Order of the Temple in 1312 a\r\nnumber of the Knights joined themselves to the Knights of St. John of\r\nJerusalem, by whom the Templar system appears to have been purged of its\r\nheretical elements. As we shall see later, the same process is said to\r\nhave been carried out by the Royal Order of Scotland, All this suggests\r\nthat the Templars had imported a secret doctrine from the East which was\r\ncapable either of a Christian or an anti-Christian interpretation, that\r\nthrough their connexion with the Royal Order of Scotland and the Knights\r\nof St. John of Jerusalem this Christian interpretation was preserved,\r\nand finally that it was this pure doctrine which passed into\r\nFreemasonry. According to early masonic authorities, the adoption of the\r\ntwo St. Johns as the patron saints of Masonry arose, not from Johannism,\r\nbut from the alliance between the Templars and the Knights of St. John\r\nof Jerusalem.[318]\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that the theory of the Templar connexion\r\nwith Freemasonry was held by the Continental Freemasons of the\r\neighteenth century, who, living at the time the Order was reconstituted\r\non its present basis, were clearly in a better position to know its\r\norigins than we who are separated from that date by a distance of two\r\nhundred years. But since their testimony first comes to light at the\r\nperiod of the upper degrees, in which the Templar influence is more\r\nclearly visible than in Craft Masonry, it must be reserved for a later\r\nchapter. Before passing on to this further stage in the history of the\r\nCraft, it is necessary to consider one more link in the chain of the\r\nmasonic tradition--the \"Holy Vehm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vehmgerichts[319]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese dread tribunals, said to have been established by Charlemagne in\r\n772[320] in Westphalia, had for their avowed object the establishment of\r\nlaw and order amidst the unsettled and even anarchic conditions that\r\nthen reigned in Germany. But by degrees the power arrogated to itself by\r\nthe \"Holy Vehm\" became so formidable that succeeding emperors were\r\nunable to control its workings and found themselves forced to become\r\ninitiates from motives of self-protection. During the twelfth century\r\nthe Vehmgerichts, by their continual executions, had created a veritable\r\n\"Red Terror,\" so that the East of Germany was known as the Red Land. In\r\n1371, says Lecouteulx de Canteleu, a fresh impetus was given to the\r\n\"Holy Vehm\" by a number of the Knights Templar who, on the dissolution\r\nof their Order, had found their way to Germany and now sought admission\r\nto the Secret Tribunals.[321] How much of Templar lore passed into the\r\nhand of the Vehmgerichts it is impossible to know, but there is\r\ncertainly a resemblance between the methods of initiation and\r\nintimidation employed by the Vehms and those described by certain of the\r\nTemplars, still more between the ceremony of the Vehms and the ritual of\r\nFreemasonry.\r\n\r\nThus the members of the Vehms, known as the _Wissende_ (or Enlightened),\r\nwere divided into three degrees of initiation: the Free Judges, the\r\nveritable Free Judges, and the Holy Judges of the Secret Tribunal. The\r\ncandidate for initiation was led blindfold before the dread Tribunal,\r\npresided over by a _Stuhlherr_ (or master of the chair) or his\r\nsubstitute, a _Freigraf_, with a sword and branch of willow at his side.\r\nThe initiate was then bound by a terrible oath not to reveal the secrets\r\nof the \"Holy Vehm,\" to warn no one of danger threatening them by its\r\ndecrees, to denounce anyone, whether father, mother, brother, sister,\r\nfriend, or relation, if such a one had been condemned by the Tribunal.\r\nAfter this he was given the password and grip by which the confederates\r\nrecognized each other. In the event of his turning traitor or revealing\r\nthe secrets confided to him his eyes were bandaged, his hands tied\r\nbehind his back, and his tongue was torn out through the back of his\r\nneck, after which he was hanged by the feet till he was dead, with the\r\nsolemn imprecation that his body should be given as a prey to the birds\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that the points of resemblance with modern\r\nmasonic ritual[322] which may here be discerned can be a mere matter of\r\ncoincidence, yet it would be equally unreasonable to trace the origins\r\nof Freemasonry to the Vehmgerichts. Clearly both derived from a common\r\nsource, either the old pagan traditions on which the early Vehms were\r\nfounded or the system of the Templars. The latter seems the more\r\nprobable for two reasons: firstly, on account of the resemblance between\r\nthe methods of the Vehmgerichts and the Assassins, which would be\r\nexplained if the Templars formed the connecting link; and secondly, the\r\nfact that in contemporary documents the members of the Secret Tribunals\r\nwere frequently referred to under the name of Rose-Croix.[323] Now,\r\nsince, as we have seen, the degree of the Rosy Cross is said to have\r\nbeen brought to Europe by the Templars, this would account for the\r\npersistence of the name in the Vehmgerichts as well as in the\r\nRosicrucians of the seventeenth century, who are said to have continued\r\nthe Templar tradition. Thus Templarism and Rosicrucianism appear to have\r\nbeen always closely connected, a fact which is not surprising since both\r\nderive from a common source--the traditions of the near East.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to an alternative theory concerning the channel through\r\nwhich Eastern doctrines, and particularly Cabalism, found their way into\r\nFreemasonry. For it must be admitted that one obstacle to the complete\r\nacceptance of the theory of the Templar succession exists, namely, that\r\nalthough the Judaic element cannot be traced further back than the\r\nCrusades, neither can it with certainty be pronounced to have come into\r\nexistence during the three centuries that followed after. Indeed, before\r\nthe publication of Anderson's \"Constitutions\" in 1723 there is no\r\ndefinite evidence that the Solomonic legend had been incorporated into\r\nthe ritual of British Masonry. So although the possession of the legend\r\nby the _compagnonnages_ of the Middle Ages would tend to prove its\r\nantiquity, there is always the possibility that it was introduced by\r\nsome later body of adepts than the Templars. According to the partisans\r\nof a further theory, these adepts were the Rosicrucians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosicrucian Origin\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and most eminent precursors of Freemasonry is said\r\nto have been Francis Bacon. As we have already seen, Bacon is recognized\r\nto have been a Rosicrucian, and that the secret philosophical doctrine\r\nhe professed was closely akin to Freemasonry is clearly apparent in his\r\n_New Atlantis_. The reference to the \"Wise Men of the Society of\r\nSolomon's House\" cannot be a mere coincidence. The choice of\r\nAtlantis--the legendary island supposed to have been submerged by the\r\nAtlantic Ocean in the remote past--would suggest that Bacon had some\r\nknowledge of a secret tradition descending from the earliest patriarchs\r\nof the human race, whom, like the modern writer Le Plongeon, he imagined\r\nto have inhabited the Western hemisphere and to have been the\r\npredecessors of the Egyptian initiates. Le Plongeon, however, places\r\nthis early seat of the mysteries still further West than the Atlantic\r\nOcean, in the region of Mayax and Yucatan.[324]\r\n\r\nBacon further relates that this tradition was preserved in its pure form\r\nby certain of the Jews, who, whilst accepting the Cabala, rejected its\r\nanti-Christian tendencies. Thus in this island of Bensalem there are\r\nJews \"of a far differing disposition from the Jews in other parts. For\r\nwhereas they hate the name of Christ, and have a secret inbred rancour\r\nagainst the people amongst whom they live; these contrariwise give unto\r\nour Saviour many high attributes,\" but at the same time they believe\r\n\"that Moses by a secret Cabala ordained the laws of Bensalem which they\r\nnow use, and that when the Messiah should come and sit on His throne at\r\nJerusalem, the King of Bensalem should sit at His feet, whereas other\r\nkings should keep at a great distance.\" This passage is of particular\r\ninterest as showing that Bacon recognized the divergence between the\r\nancient secret tradition descending from Moses and the perverted Jewish\r\nCabala of the Rabbis, and that he was perfectly aware of the tendency\r\neven among the best of Jews to turn the former to the advantage of the\r\nMessianic dreams.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pott, who in her _Francis Bacon and his Secret Society_ sets out to\r\nprove that Bacon was the founder of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry,\r\nignores all the previous history of the secret tradition. Bacon was not\r\nthe originator but the inheritor of the ideas on which both these\r\nsocieties were founded. And the further contention that Bacon was at the\r\nsame time the author of the greatest dramas in the English language and\r\nof _The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosengreutz_ is manifestly\r\nabsurd. Nevertheless, Bacon's influence amongst the Rosicrucians is\r\napparent; Heydon's _Voyage to the Land of the Rosicrucians_ is in fact a\r\nmere plagiarism of Bacon's _New Atlantis_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pott seems to imagine that by proclaiming Bacon to have been the\r\nfounder or even a member of the Order of Freemasonry she is revealing a\r\ngreat masonic secret which Freemasons have conspired to keep dark. But\r\nwhy should the Craft desire to disown so illustrious a progenitor or\r\nseek to conceal his connexion with the Order if any such existed?\r\nFindel, indeed, frankly admits that the _New Atlantis_ contained\r\nunmistakable allusions to Freemasonry and that Bacon contributed to its\r\nfinal transformation.[325] This was doubtless brought about largely by\r\nthe English Rosicrucians who followed after. To suggest then that\r\nFreemasonry originated with the Rosicrucians is to ignore the previous\r\nhistory of the secret tradition. Rosicrucianism was not the beginning\r\nbut a link in the long chain connecting Freemasonry with far earlier\r\nsecret associations. The resemblance between the two Orders admits of no\r\ndenial. Thus Yarker writes: \"The symbolic tracing of the Rosicrucians\r\nwas a Square Temple approached by seven steps ... here also we find the\r\ntwo pillars of Hermes, the five-pointed star, sun and moon, compasses,\r\nsquare and triangle.\" Yarker further observes that \"even Wren was more\r\nor less a student of Hermeticism, and if we had a full list of\r\nFreemasons and Rosicrucians we should probably be surprised at the\r\nnumbers who belonged to both systems.\"[326]\r\n\r\nProfessor Bühle emphatically states that \"Freemasonry is neither more\r\nnor less than Rosicrucianism as modified by those who transplanted it\r\ninto England.\" Chambers, who published his famous _Cyclopædia_ in 1728,\r\nobserves: \"Some who are no friends to Freemasonry, make the present\r\nflourishing society of Freemasons a branch of _Rosicrucians_, or rather\r\nthe Rosicrucians themselves under a new name or relation, viz. as\r\nretainers to building. And it is certain there are some Freemasons who\r\nhave all the characters of Rosicrucians.\"\r\n\r\nThe connexion between Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism is, however, a\r\nquestion hardly less controversial than that of the connexion between\r\nFreemasonry and Templarism.\r\n\r\nDr. Mackey violently disputes the theory. \"The Rosicrucians,\" he writes,\r\n\"as this brief history indicates, had no connexion whatever with the\r\nmasonic fraternity. Notwithstanding this fact, Barruel, the most\r\nmalignant of our revilers, with a characteristic spirit of\r\nmisrepresentation, attempted to identify the two institutions.\"[327]\r\nBut the aforesaid \"brief history\" indicates nothing of the kind, and the\r\nreference to Barruel as a malignant reviler for suggesting a connexion,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, many Freemasons admit, shows on which side this\r\n\"spirit of misrepresentation\" exists. It is interesting, however, to\r\nnote that in the eyes of certain masonic writers connexion with the\r\nRosicrucians is regarded as highly discreditable; the fraternity would\r\nthus appear to have been less blameless than we have been taught to\r\nbelieve. Mr. Waite is equally concerned with proving that there \"is no\r\ntraceable connexion between Masonry and Rosicrucianism,\" and he goes on\r\nto explain that Freemasonry was never a learned society, that it never\r\nlaid claim to \"any transcendental secrets of alchemy and magic, or to\r\nany skill in medicine,\" etc.[328]\r\n\r\nThe truth may lie between the opposing contentions of Prof. Bühle and\r\nhis two masonic antagonists. The Freemasons were clearly, for the\r\nreasons given by Mr. Waite, not a mere continuation of the Rosicrucians,\r\nbut more likely borrowed from the Rosicrucians a part of their system\r\nand symbols which they adapted to their own purpose. Moreover, the\r\nincontrovertible fact is that in the list of English Freemasons and\r\nRosicrucians we find men who belonged to both Orders and amongst these\r\ntwo who contributed largely to the constitutions of English Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is Robert Fludd, whom Mr. Waite describes as \"the\r\ncentral figure of Rosicrucian literature, ... an intellectual giant, ...\r\na man of immense erudition, of exalted mind, and, to judge by his\r\nwritings, of extreme personal sanctity. Ennemoser describes him as one\r\nof the most distinguished disciples of Paracelsus....\"[329] Yarker adds\r\nthis clue: \"In 1630 we find Fludd, the chief of the Rosicrucians, using\r\narchitectural language, and there is proof that his Society was divided\r\ninto degrees, and from the fact that the Masons' Company of London had\r\na copy of the Masonic Charges 'presented by Mr. fflood' we may suppose\r\nthat he was a Freemason before 1620.\"[330]\r\n\r\nA still more important link is Elias Ashmole, the antiquary, astrologer,\r\nand alchemist, founder of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, who was born\r\nin 1617. An avowed Rosicrucian, and as we have seen, also a Freemason,\r\nAshmole displayed great energy in reconstituting the Craft; he is said\r\nto have perfected its organization, to have added to it further mystic\r\nsymbols, and according to Ragon, it was he who drew up the ritual of the\r\nexisting three Craft degrees--Entered Apprentice, Fellow-Craft, and\r\nMaster Mason--which was adopted by Grand Lodge in 1717. Whence did these\r\nfresh inspirations come but from the Rosicrucians? For, as Ragon also\r\ninforms us, in the year that Ashmole was received into Freemasonry the\r\nRosicrucians held their meeting in the same room at Mason Hall![331]\r\n\r\nHow, then, can it be said that there was \"no traceable connexion between\r\nFreemasonry and Rosicrucianism?\" and why should it be the part of a\r\n\"malignant reviler\" to connect them? It is not suggested that\r\nRosicrucians, such as Fludd or Ashmole, imported any magical elements\r\ninto Freemasonry, but simply the system and symbols of the Rose-Croix\r\nwith a certain degree of esoteric learning. That Rosicrucianism forms an\r\nimportant link in the chain of the secret tradition is therefore\r\nundeniable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seventeenth-Century Rabbis\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a third channel through which the Judaic legends of\r\nFreemasonry may have penetrated to the Craft, namely, the Rabbis of the\r\nseventeenth century. The Jewish writer Bernard Lazare has declared that\r\n\"there were Jews around the cradle of Freemasonry,\"[332] and if this\r\nstatement is applied to the period preceding the institution of Grand\r\nLodge in 1717 it certainly finds confirmation in fact. Thus it is said\r\nthat in the preceding century the coat-of-arms now used by Grand Lodge\r\nhad been designed by an Amsterdam Jew, Jacob Jehuda Leon Templo,\r\ncolleague of Cromwell's friend the Cabalist, Manasseh ben Israel.[333]\r\nTo quote Jewish authority on this question, Mr. Lucien Wolf writes that\r\nTemplo \"had a monomania for ... everything relating to the Temple of\r\nSolomon and the Tabernacle of the Wilderness. He constructed gigantic\r\nmodels of both these edifices.\"[334] These he exhibited in London,\r\nwhich he visited in 1675 and earlier, and it seems not unreasonable to\r\nconclude that this may have provided a fresh source of inspiration to\r\nthe Freemasons who framed the masonic ritual some forty years later. At\r\nany rate, the masonic coat-of-arms still used by Grand Lodge of England\r\nis undoubtedly of Jewish design.\r\n\r\n\"This coat,\" says Mr. Lucien Wolf, \"is entirely composed of Jewish\r\nsymbols,\" and is \"an attempt to display heraldically the various forms\r\nof the Cherubim pictured to us in the second vision of Ezekiel--an Ox, a\r\nMan, a Lion, and an Eagle--and thus belongs to the highest and most\r\nmystical domain of Hebrew symbolism.\"[335]\r\n\r\nIn other words, this vision, known to the Jews as the \"Mercaba,\"[336]\r\nbelongs to the Cabala, where a particular interpretation is placed on\r\neach figure so as to provide an esoteric meaning not perceptible to the\r\nuninitiated.[337] The masonic coat-of-arms is thus entirely Cabalistic;\r\nas is also the seal on the diplomas of Craft Masonry, where another\r\nCabalistic figure, that of a man and woman combined, is reproduced.[338]\r\n\r\nOf the Jewish influence in Masonry after 1717 I shall speak later.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, the origins of the system we now know as Freemasonry\r\nare not to be found in one source alone. The twelve alternative sources\r\nenumerated in the _Masonic Cyclopædia_ and quoted at the beginning of\r\nthis chapter may all have contributed to its formation. Thus Operative\r\nMasonry may have descended from the Roman Collegia and through the\r\noperative masons of the Middle Ages, whilst Speculative Masonry may have\r\nderived from the patriarchs and the mysteries of the pagans. But the\r\nsource of inspiration which admits of no denial is the Jewish Cabala.\r\nWhether this penetrated to our country through the Roman Collegia, the\r\n_compagnonnages_, the Templars, the Rosicrucians, or through the Jews of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, whose activities behind the\r\nscenes of Freemasonry we shall see later, is a matter of speculation.\r\nThe fact remains that when the ritual and constitutions of Masonry were\r\ndrawn up in 1717, although certain fragments of the ancient Egyptian and\r\nPythagorean doctrines were retained, the Judaic version of the secret\r\ntradition was the one selected by the founders of Grand Lodge on which\r\nto build up their system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND LODGE ERA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever were the origins of the Order we now know as Freemasonry, it is\r\nclear that during the century preceding its reorganization under Grand\r\nLodge of London the secret system of binding men together for a common\r\npurpose, based on Eastern esoteric doctrines, had been anticipated by\r\nthe Rosicrucians. Was this secret system employed, however by any other\r\nbody of men? It is certainly easy to imagine how in this momentous\r\nseventeenth century, when men of all opinions were coalescing against\r\nopposing forces--Lutherans combining against the Papacy, Catholics\r\nrallying their forces against invading Protestantism, Republicans\r\nplotting in favour of Cromwell, Royalists in their turn plotting to\r\nrestore the Stuarts, finally Royalists plotting against each other on\r\nbehalf of rival dynasties--an organization of this kind, enabling one to\r\nwork secretly for a cause and to set invisibly vast numbers of human\r\nbeings in motion, might prove invaluable to any party.\r\n\r\nThus, according to certain masonic writers on the Continent, the system\r\nused by the Rosicrucians in their fight against \"Popery\" was also\r\nemployed by the Jesuits for a directly opposite purpose. In the\r\nmanuscripts of the Prince of Hesse published by Lecouteulx de Canteleu\r\nit is declared that in 1714 the Jesuits used the mysteries of the\r\nRose-Croix. Mirabeau also relates that \"the Jesuits profited by the\r\ninternal troubles of the reign of Charles I to possess themselves of the\r\nsymbols, the allegories, and the carpets (tapis) of the Rose-Croix\r\nmasons, who were only the ancient order of the Templars secretly\r\nperpetuated. It may be seen by means of what imperceptible innovations\r\nthey succeeded in substituting their catechism to the instruction of the\r\nTemplars.\"[339]\r\n\r\nOther Continental writers again assert that Cromwell, the arch-opponent\r\nof the Catholic Church, was \"a higher initiate of masonic mysteries,\"\r\nand used the system for his own elevation to power[340]; further, that\r\nhe found himself outdistanced by the Levellers; that this sect, whose\r\nname certainly suggests masonic inspiration, adopted for its symbols the\r\nsquare and compass,[341] and in its claim of real equality threatened\r\nthe supremacy of the usurper. Finally, Elias Ashmole, the Rosicrucian\r\nRoyalist, is said to have turned the masonic system against Cromwell, so\r\nthat towards the end of the seventeenth century the Order rallied to the\r\nStuart cause.[342]\r\n\r\nBut all this is pure speculation resting on no basis of known facts. The\r\naccusation that the Jesuits used the system of the Rose-Croix as a cover\r\nto political intrigues is referred to by the Rosicrucian Eliphas Lévi as\r\nthe outcome of ignorance, which \"refutes itself.\" It is significant to\r\nnotice that it emanates mainly from Germany and from the Illuminati; the\r\nPrince of Hesse was a member of the _Stricte Observance_ and Mirabeau an\r\nIlluminatus at the time he wrote the passage quoted above. That in the\r\nseventeenth century certain Jesuits played the part of political\r\nintriguers I suppose their warmest friends will hardly deny, but that\r\nthey employed any secret or masonic system seems to me perfectly\r\nincapable of proof. I shall return to this point later, however, in\r\nconnexion with the Illuminati.\r\n\r\nAs to Cromwell, the only circumstance that lends any colour to the\r\npossibility of his connexion with Freemasonry is his known friendship\r\nfor Manasseh ben Israel, the colleague of the Rabbi Templo who designed\r\nthe coat-of-arms later adopted by Grand Lodge. If, therefore, the Jews\r\nof Amsterdam were a source of inspiration to the Freemasons of the\r\nseventeenth century, it is not impossible that Cromwell may have been\r\nthe channel through which this influence first penetrated.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the Stuarts we are, however, on firm ground with regard\r\nto Freemasonry. That the lodges at the end of the seventeenth century\r\nwere Royalist is certain, and there seems good reason to believe that,\r\nwhen the revolution of 1688 divided the Royalist cause, the Jacobites\r\nwho fled to France with James II took Freemasonry with them.[343] With\r\nthe help of the French they established lodges in which, it is said,\r\nmasonic rites and symbols were used to promote the cause of the Stuarts.\r\nThus the land of promise signified Great Britain, Jerusalem stood for\r\nLondon, and the murder of Hiram represented the execution of Charles\r\nI.[344]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Freemasonry in England did not continue to adhere to the\r\nStuart cause as it had done under the ægis of Elias Ashmole, and by 1717\r\nis said to have become Hanoverian.\r\n\r\nFrom this important date the official history of the present system may\r\nbe said to begin; hitherto everything rests on stray documents, of which\r\nthe authenticity is frequently doubtful, and which provide no continuous\r\nhistory of the Order. In 1717 for the first time Freemasonry was\r\nestablished on a settled basis and in the process underwent a\r\nfundamental change. So far it would seem to have retained an operative\r\nelement, but in the transformation that now took place this was entirely\r\neliminated, and the whole Order was transformed into a middle-and\r\nupper-class speculative body. This _coup d'état_, already suggested in\r\n1703, took place in 1716, when four London lodges of Freemasons met\r\ntogether at the Apple Tree Tavern in Charles Street, Covent Garden, \"and\r\nhaving put into the chair the oldest Master Mason (now the Master of a\r\nlodge), they constituted themselves a Grand Lodge, _pro tempore_, in due\r\nform.\" On St. John the Baptist's Day, June 24 of the next year, the\r\nannual assembly and banquet were held at the Goose and Gridiron in St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard, when Mr. Antony Sayer was elected Grand Master and\r\ninvested with all the badges of office.[345]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above account that already in 1717 the\r\nspeculative elements must have predominated in the lodges, otherwise we\r\nmight expect to find the operative masons taking some part in these\r\nproceedings and expressing their opinion as to whether their association\r\nshould pass under the control of men entirely unconnected with the\r\nCraft. But no, the leaders of the new movement all appear to have\r\nbelonged to the middle class, nor from this moment do either masons or\r\narchitects seem to have played any prominent part in Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nBut the point that official history does not attempt to elucidate is\r\nthe reason for this decision. Why should the Freemasons of\r\nLondon--whether they were at this date a speculative or only a\r\nsemi-speculative association--have suddenly recognized the necessity of\r\nestablishing a Grand Lodge and drawing up a ritual and \"Constitution\"?\r\nIt is evident, then, that some circumstances must have arisen which led\r\nthem to take this important step. I would suggest that the following may\r\nbe the solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry, as we have seen, was a system that could be employed in any\r\ncause and had now come to be used by intriguers of every kind--and not\r\nonly by intriguers, but by merely convivial bodies, \"jolly Brotherhoods\r\nof the Bottle,\" who modelled themselves on masonic associations.[346]\r\nBut the honest citizens of London who met and feasted at the Goose and\r\nGridiron were clearly not intriguers, they were neither Royalist nor\r\nRepublican plotters, neither Catholic nor Lutheran fanatics, neither\r\nalchemists nor magicians, nor can it be supposed that they were simply\r\nrevellers. If they were political, they were certainly not supporters of\r\nthe Stuarts; on the contrary, they were generally reported to have been\r\nHanoverian in their sympathies, indeed Dr. Bussell goes so far as to say\r\nthat Grand Lodge was instituted to support the Hanoverian dynasty.[347]\r\nIt would be perhaps nearer the truth to conclude that if they were\r\nHanoverian it was because they were constitutional, and the Hanoverian\r\ndynasty having now been established they wished to avoid further\r\nchanges. In a word, then, they were simply men of peace, anxious to put\r\nan end to dissensions, who, seeing the system of Masonry utilized for\r\nthe purpose of promoting discord, determined to wrest it from the hands\r\nof political intriguers and restore it to its original character of\r\nbrotherhood, though not of brotherhood between working masons only, but\r\nbetween men drawn from all classes and professions. By founding a Grand\r\nLodge in London and drawing up a ritual and \"Constitutions,\" they hoped\r\nto prevent the perversion of their signs and symbols and to establish\r\nthe Order on a settled basis.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nicolai this pacific purpose had already animated English\r\nFreemasons under the Grand Mastership of Sir Christopher Wren: \"Its\r\nprincipal object from this period was to moderate the religious hatreds\r\nso terrible in England during the reign of James II and to try and\r\nestablish some kind of concord or fraternity, by weakening as far as\r\npossible the antagonisms arising from the differences of religions,\r\nranks, and interests.\" An eighteenth-century manuscript of the Prince of\r\nHesse quoted by Lecouteulx de Canteleu expresses the view that in 1717\r\n\"_the mysteries of Freemasonry were reformed and purified in England of\r\nall political tendencies_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the matter of religion, Craft Masonry adopted an equally\r\nnon-sectarian attitude. The first \"Constitutions\" of the Order, drawn up\r\nby Dr. Anderson in 1723, contain the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n     Concerning God and Religion\r\n\r\n     A Mason is obliged, by his tenure, to obey the moral Law; and if he\r\n     rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor\r\n     an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient Times Masons were\r\n     charged in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or\r\n     Nation, whatever it was, yet, 'tis now thought more expedient only\r\n     to oblige them to that Religion in which all men agree, leaving\r\n     their particular Opinions to themselves; that is to be good Men and\r\n     true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or\r\n     Persuasions they may be distinguish'd; whereby Masonry becomes the\r\n     Centre of Union and the Means of Conciliating true Friendship among\r\n     Persons that must have remained at a perpetual Distance.\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"that Religion in which all men agree\" has been censured by\r\nCatholic writers as advocating a universal religion in the place of\r\nChristianity. But this by no means follows. The idea is surely that\r\nMasons should be men adhering to that law of right and wrong common to\r\nall religious faiths. Craft Masonry may thus be described as Deist in\r\ncharacter, but not in the accepted sense of the word which implies the\r\nrejection of Christian doctrines. If Freemasonry had been Deist in this\r\nsense might we not expect to find some connexion between the founders of\r\nGrand Lodge and the school of Deists--Toland, Bolingbroke, Woolston,\r\nHume, and others--which flourished precisely at this period? Might not\r\nsome analogy be detected between the organization of the Order and the\r\nSodalities described in Toland's _Pantheisticon_, published in 1720? But\r\nof this I can find no trace whatever. The principal founders of Grand\r\nLodge were, as we have seen, clergymen, both engaged in preaching\r\nChristian doctrines at their respective churches.[348] It is surely\r\ntherefore reasonable to conclude that Freemasonry at the time of its\r\nreorganization in 1717 was Deistic only in so far that it invited men to\r\nmeet together on the common ground of a belief in God. Moreover, some of\r\nthe early English rituals contain distinctly Christian elements. Thus\r\nboth in _Jachin and Boaz_ (1762) and _Hiram or the Grand Master Key to\r\nthe Door of both Antient and Modern Freemasonry by a Member of the Royal\r\nArch_ (1766) we find prayers in the lodges concluding with the name of\r\nChrist. These passages were replaced much later by purely Deistic\r\nformulas under the Grand Mastership of the free-thinking Duke of Sussex\r\nin 1813.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of its innocuous character, Freemasonry, merely by reason\r\nof its secrecy, soon began to excite alarm in the public mind. As early\r\nas 1724 a work entitled _The Grand Mystery of the Freemasons Discovered_\r\nhad provoked an angry remonstrance from the Craft[349]; and when the\r\nFrench edict against the Order was passed, a letter signed \"Jachin\"\r\nappeared in _The Gentleman's Magazine_ declaring the \"Freemasons who\r\nhave lately been suppressed not only in France but in Holland\" to be \"a\r\ndangerous Race of Men\":\r\n\r\n     No Government ought to suffer such clandestine Assemblies where\r\n     Plots against the State may be carried on, under the Pretence of\r\n     Brotherly Love and good Fellowship.\r\n\r\nThe writer, evidently unaware of possible Templar traditions, goes on to\r\nobserve that the sentinel placed at the door of the lodge with a drawn\r\nsword in his hand \"is not the only mark of their being a military\r\nOrder\"; and suggests that the title of Grand Master is taken in\r\nimitation of the Knights of Malta. \"Jachin,\" moreover, scents a Popish\r\nplot:\r\n\r\n     They not only admit Turks, Jews, Infidels, but even Jacobites,\r\n     non-jurors and Papists themselves ... how can we be sure that\r\n     those Persons who are known to be well affected, are let into all\r\n     their Mysteries? They make no scruple to acknowledge that there is\r\n     a Distinction between Prentices and Master Masons and who knows\r\n     whether they may not have an higher Order of Cabalists, who keep\r\n     the Grand Secret of all entirely to themselves?[350]\r\n\r\nLater on in France, the Abbé Pérau published his satires on Freemasonry,\r\n_Le Secret des Francs-Maçons_ (1742), _L'Ordre des Francs-Maçons trahi\r\net le Secret des Mopses révélé_, (1745), and _Les Francs-Maçons écrasés_\r\n(1746)[351] and in about 1761 another English writer said to be a Mason\r\nbrought down a torrent of invective on his head by the publication of\r\nthe ritual of the Craft Degrees under the name of _Jachin and\r\nBoaz_.[352]\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that from all this controversy no party emerges in a\r\nvery charitable light, Catholics and Protestants alike indulging in\r\nsarcasms and reckless accusations against Freemasonry, the Freemasons\r\nretorting with far from brotherly forbearance.[353] But, again, one must\r\nremember that all these men were of their age--an age which seen through\r\nthe eyes of Hogarth would certainly not appear to have been\r\ndistinguished for delicacy. It should be noted, however, when one reads\r\nin masonic works of the \"persecutions\" to which Freemasonry has been\r\nsubjected, that aggression was not confined only to the one side in the\r\nconflict; moreover, that the Freemasons at this period were divided\r\namongst themselves and expressed with regard to opposing groups much the\r\nsame suspicions that non-Masons expressed with regard to the Order as a\r\nwhole. For the years following after the suppression of Masonry in\r\nFrance were marked by the most important development in the history of\r\nthe modern Order--the inauguration of the Additional Degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Additional Degrees\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin and inspiration of the additional degrees has provoked hardly\r\nless controversy in masonic circles than the origin of Masonry itself.\r\nIt should be explained that Craft Masonry, or Blue Masonry--that is to\r\nsay, the first three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and\r\nMaster Mason of which I have attempted to trace the history--were the\r\nonly degrees recognized by Grand Lodge at the time of its foundation in\r\n1717 and still form the basis of all forms of modern Masonry. On this\r\nfoundation were erected, somewhere between 1740 and 1743, the degree of\r\nthe Royal Arch and the first of the series of upper degrees now known as\r\nthe Scottish Rite or as the Ancient and Accepted Rite. The acceptance or\r\nrejection of this superstructure has always formed a subject of violent\r\ncontroversy between Masons, one body affirming that Craft Masonry is the\r\nonly true and genuine Masonry, the other declaring that the real object\r\nof Masonry is only to be found in the higher degrees. It was this\r\ncontroversy, centring round the Royal Arch degree, that about the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century split Masonry into opposing camps of Ancients\r\nand Moderns, the Ancients declaring that the R.A. was \"the Root, Heart,\r\nand Marrow of Freemasonry,\"[354] the Moderns rejecting it. Although\r\nworked by the Ancients from 1756 onwards, this degree was definitely\r\nrepudiated by Grand Lodge in 1792,[355] and only in 1813 was officially\r\nreceived into English Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nThe R.A. degree, which is said nevertheless to be contained in embryo in\r\nthe 1723 Book of Constitutions,[356] is purely Judaic--a glorification\r\nof Israel and commemorating the building of the second Temple. That it\r\nwas derived from the Jewish Cabala seems probable, and Yarker,\r\ncommenting on the phrase in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ quoted\r\nabove--\"Who knows whether they (the Freemasons) have not a higher order\r\nof Cabalists, who keep the Grand Secret of all entirely to\r\nthemselves\"--observes: \"It looks very like an intimation of the Royal\r\nArch degree,\"[357] and elsewhere he states that \"the Royal Arch degree,\r\nwhen it had the Three Veils, must have been the work, even if by\r\ninstruction, of a Cabalistic Jew about 1740, and from this time we may\r\nexpect to find a secret tradition grafted upon Anderson's system.\"[358]\r\n\r\nPrecisely in this same year of 1740 Mr. Waite says that \"an itinerant\r\npedlar of the Royal Arch degree is said to have propagated it in\r\nIreland, claiming that it was practised at York and London,\"[359] and\r\nin 1744 a certain Dr. Dassigny wrote that the minds of the Dublin\r\nbrethren had been lately disturbed about Royal Arch Masonry owing to the\r\nactivities in Dublin of \"a number of traders or hucksters in pretended\r\nMasonry,\" whom the writer connects with \"Italians\" or the \"Italic\r\nOrder.\"\r\n\r\nA Freemason quoting this passage in a recent discussion on the upper\r\ndegrees expresses the opinion that these hucksters were \"Jacobite\r\nemissaries disguised under the form of a pretended Masonry,\" and that\r\n\"by Italians and Italian Order he intends a reference to the Court of\r\nKing James III, i.e. the Old Pretender at Rome, and to the Ecossais\r\n(Italic) Order of Masonry.\"[360] It is much more likely that he had\r\nreferred to another source of masonic instruction in Italy which I shall\r\nindicate in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nBut precisely at the moment when it is suggested that the Jacobites were\r\nintriguing to introduce the Royal Arch degree into Masonry they are also\r\nsaid to have been engaged in elaborating the \"Scottish Rite.\" Let us\r\nexamine this contention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFreemasonry in France\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Grand Lodge in London had been followed by the\r\ninauguration of Masonic Lodges on the Continent--in 1721 at Mons, in\r\n1725 in Paris, in 1728 at Madrid, in 1731 at The Hague, in 1733 at\r\nHamburg, etc. Several of these received their warrant from the Grand\r\nLodge of England. But this was not the case with the Grand Lodge of\r\nParis, which did not receive a warrant till 1743.\r\n\r\nThe men who founded this lodge, far from being non-political, were\r\nJacobite leaders engaged in active schemes for the restoration of the\r\nStuart dynasty. The leader of the group, Charles Radcliffe, had been\r\nimprisoned with his brother, the ill-fated Lord Derwentwater who was\r\nexecuted on Tower Hill in 1716. Charles had succeeded in escaping from\r\nNewgate and made his way to France, where he assumed the title of Lord\r\nDerwentwater, although the Earldom had ceased to exist under the\r\nbill of attainder against his brother.[361] It was this Lord\r\nDerwentwater--afterwards executed for taking part in the 1745\r\nrebellion--who with several other Jacobites is said to have founded the\r\nGrand Lodge of Paris in 1725, and himself to have become Grand Master.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite character of the Paris lodge is not a matter of dispute.\r\nMr. Gould relates that \"the colleagues of Lord Derwentwater are stated\r\nto have been a Chevalier Maskeline, a Squire Heguerty, and others, all\r\npartisans of the Stuarts.\"[362] But he goes on to contest the theory\r\nthat they used Freemasonry in the Stuart cause, which he regards as\r\namounting to a charge of bad faith. This is surely unreasonable. The\r\nfounders of Grand Lodge in Paris did not derive from Grand Lodge in\r\nLondon, from which they held no warrant,[363] but, as we have seen, took\r\ntheir Freemasonry with them to France before Grand Lodge of London was\r\ninstituted; they were therefore in no way bound by its regulations. And\r\nuntil the Constitutions of Anderson were published in 1723 no rule had\r\nbeen laid down that the Lodges should be non-political. In the old days\r\nFreemasonry had always been Royalist, as we see from the ancient charges\r\nthat members should be \"true liegemen of the King\"; and if the adherents\r\nof James Edward saw in him their rightful sovereign, they may have\r\nconceived that they were using Freemasonry for a lawful purpose in\r\nadapting it to his cause. So although we may applaud the decision of the\r\nLondon Freemasons to purge Freemasonry of political tendencies and\r\ntransform it into a harmonious system of brotherhood, we cannot accuse\r\nthe Jacobites in France of bad faith in not conforming to a decision in\r\nwhich they had taken no part and in establishing lodges on their own\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, as too frequently happens when men form secret\r\nconfederacies for a wholly honourable purpose, their ranks were\r\npenetrated by confederates of another kind. It has been said in an\r\nearlier chapter that, according to the documents produced by the _Ordre\r\ndu Temple_ in the early part of the nineteenth century, the Templars had\r\nnever ceased to exist in spite of their official suppression in 1312,\r\nand that a line of Grand Masters had succeeded each other in unbroken\r\nsuccession from Jacques du Molay to the Duc de Cossé-Brissac, who was\r\nkilled in 1792. The Grand Master appointed in 1705 is stated to have\r\nbeen Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, later the Regent. Mr. Waite has expressed\r\nthe opinion that all this was an invention of the late eighteenth\r\ncentury, and that the Charter of Larmenius was fabricated at this date\r\nthough not published until 1811 by the revived _Ordre du Temple_ under\r\nthe Grand Master, Fabré Palaprat. But evidence points to a contrary\r\nconclusion. M. Matter, who, as we have seen, disbelieves the story of\r\nthe _Ordre du Temple_ and the authenticity of the Charter of Larmenius\r\nin so far as it professes to be a genuine fourteenth-century document,\r\nnevertheless asserts that the _savants_ who have examined it declare it\r\nto date from the early part of the eighteenth century, at which period\r\nMatter believes the Gospel of St. John used by the Order to have been\r\narranged so as \"to accompany the ceremonies of some masonic or secret\r\nsociety.\" Now, it was about 1740 that a revival of Templarism took place\r\nin France and Germany; we cannot therefore doubt that if Matter is right\r\nin this hypothesis, the secret society in question was that of the\r\nTemplars, whether they existed as lineal descendants of the\r\ntwelfth-century Order or merely as a revival of that Order. The\r\nexistence of the German Templars at this date under the name of the\r\n_Stricte Observance_ (which we shall deal with in a further chapter) is\r\nindeed a fact disputed by no one; but that there was also an _Ordre du\r\nTemple_ in France at the very beginning of the eighteenth century must\r\nbe regarded as highly probable. Dr. Mackey, John Yarker, and Lecouteulx\r\nde Canteleu (who, owing to his possession of Templar documents, had\r\nexclusive sources of information) all declare this to have been the case\r\nand accept the Charter of Larmenius as authentic. \"It is quite certain,\"\r\nsays Yarker, \"that there was at this period in France an _Ordre du\r\nTemple_, with a charter from John Mark Larmenius, who claimed\r\nappointment from Jacques du Molay. Philippe of Orléans accepted the\r\nGrand Mastership in 1705 and signed the Statutes.\"[364]\r\n\r\nWithout, however, necessarily accepting the Charter of Larmenius as\r\nauthentic let us examine the probability of this assertion with regard\r\nto the Duc d'Orléans.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Jacobites supporting Lord Derwentwater at the Grand Lodge of\r\nParis was a certain Andrew Michael Ramsay, known as Chevalier Ramsay,\r\nwho was born at Ayr near the famous Lodge of Kilwinning, where the\r\nTemplars are said to have formed their alliance with the masons in 1314.\r\nIn 1710 Ramsay was converted to the Roman Catholic faith by Fénelon and\r\nin 1724 became tutor to the sons of the Pretender at Rome. Mr. Gould has\r\nrelated that during his stay in France, Ramsay had formed a friendship\r\nwith the Regent, Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, who was Grand Master of the\r\n_Ordre de Saint-Lazare_, instituted during the Crusades as a body of\r\nHospitallers devoting themselves to the care of the lepers and which in\r\n1608 had been joined to the _Ordre du Mont-Carmel_. It seems probable\r\nfrom all accounts that Ramsay was a Chevalier of this Order, but he\r\ncannot have been admitted into it by the Duc d'Orléans, for the Grand\r\nMaster of the Ordre de Saint-Lazare was not the Duc d'Orléans but the\r\nMarquis de Dangeau, who, on his death in 1720, was succeeded by the son\r\nof the Regent, the Duc de Chartres.[365] If, then, Ramsay was admitted\r\nto any Order by the Regent, it was surely the _Ordre du Temple_, of\r\nwhich the Regent is said to have been the Grand Master at this date.\r\n\r\nNow, the infamous character of the Duc d'Orléans is a matter of common\r\nknowledge; moreover, during the Regency--that period of impiety and\r\nmoral dissolution hitherto unparalleled in the history of France--the\r\nchief of council was the Duc de Bourbon, who later placed his mistress\r\nthe Marquise de Prie and the financier Paris Duverney at the head of\r\naffairs, thus creating a scandal of such magnitude that he was exiled\r\nin 1726 through the influence of Cardinal Fleury. This Duc de Bourbon in\r\n1737 is said to have become Grand Master of the Temple. \"It was thus,\"\r\nobserves de Canteleu, \"that these two Grand Masters of the Temple\r\ndegraded the royal authority and ceaselessly increased hatred against\r\nthe government.\"\r\n\r\nIt would therefore seem strange that a man so upright as Ramsay appears\r\nto have been, who had moreover but recently been converted to the\r\nCatholic Church, should have formed a friendship with the dissolute\r\nRegent of France, unless there had been some bond between them. But here\r\nwe have a possible explanation--Templarism. Doubtless during Ramsay's\r\nyouth at Kilwinning many Templar traditions had come to his knowledge,\r\nand if in France he found himself befriended by the Grand Master\r\nhimself, what wonder that he should have entered into an alliance which\r\nresulted in his admission to an Order he had been accustomed to revere\r\nand which, moreover, was represented to him as the _fons et origo_ of\r\nthe masonic brotherhood to which he also belonged? It is thus that we\r\nfind Ramsay in the very year that the Duc de Bourbon is said to have\r\nbeen made Grand Master of the Temple artlessly writing to Cardinal\r\nFleury asking him to extend his protection to the society of Freemasons\r\nin Paris and enclosing a copy of the speech which he was to deliver on\r\nthe following day, March 21, 1737. It is in this famous oration that for\r\nthe first time we find Freemasonry traced to the Crusades:\r\n\r\n     At the time of the Crusades in Palestine many princes, lords, and\r\n     citizens associated themselves, and vowed to restore the Temple of\r\n     the Christians in the Holy Land, and to employ themselves in\r\n     bringing back their architecture to its first institution. They\r\n     agreed upon several ancient signs and symbolic words drawn from the\r\n     well of religion in order to recognize themselves amongst the\r\n     heathens and Saracens. These signs and words were only communicated\r\n     to those who promised solemnly, and even sometimes at the foot of\r\n     the altar, never to reveal them. This sacred promise was therefore\r\n     not an execrable oath, as it has been called, but a respectable\r\n     bond to unite Christians of all nationalities into one\r\n     confraternity. Some time afterwards our Order formed an intimate\r\n     union with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. From that time our\r\n     Lodges took the name of Lodges of St. John.[366]\r\n\r\nThis speech of Ramsay's has raised a storm of controversy amongst\r\nFreemasons because it contains a very decided hint of a connexion\r\nbetween Templarism and Freemasonry. Mr. Tuckett, in the paper referred\r\nto above, points out that only the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem are\r\nhere mentioned,[367] but Ramsay distinctly speaks of \"our Order\" forming\r\na union with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, and we know that the\r\nTemplars did eventually form such a union. The fact that Ramsay does not\r\nmention the Templars by name admits of a very plausible explanation. It\r\nmust be remembered that, as Mr. Gould has shown, a copy of the oration\r\nwas enclosed by Ramsay in his letter to Cardinal Fleury appealing for\r\nroyal protection to be extended to Freemasonry; it is therefore hardly\r\nlikely that he would have proclaimed a connexion between the Order he\r\nwas anxious to present in the most favourable light and one which had\r\nformerly been suppressed by King and Pope. Moreover, if the Charter of\r\nLarmenius is to be believed, the newly elected Grand Master of the\r\nTemple was the Duc de Bourbon, who had already incurred the Cardinal's\r\ndispleasure. Obviously, therefore, Templar influence was kept in the\r\nbackground. This is not to imply bad faith on the part of Ramsay, who\r\ndoubtless held the Order of Templars to be wholly praiseworthy; but he\r\ncould not expect the King or Cardinal to share his view, and therefore\r\nheld it more prudent to refer to the progenitors of Freemasonry under\r\nthe vague description of a crusading body. Ramsay's well-meant effort\r\nmet, however, with no success. Whether on account of this unlucky\r\nreference by which the Cardinal may have detected Templar influence or\r\nfor some other reason, the appeal for royal protection was not only\r\nrefused, but the new Order, which hitherto Catholics had been allowed to\r\nenter, was now prohibited by Royal edict. In the following year, 1738,\r\nthe Pope, Clement XII, issued a bull, _In Eminenti_, banning\r\nFreemasonry and excommunicating Catholics who took part in it.\r\n\r\nBut this prohibition appears to have been without effect, for\r\nFreemasonry not only prospered but soon began to manufacture new\r\ndegrees. And in the masonic literature of the following thirty years the\r\nTemplar tradition becomes still more clearly apparent. Thus the\r\nChevalier de Bérage in a well-known pamphlet, of which the first edition\r\nis said to have appeared in 1747,[368] gives the following account of\r\nthe origins of Freemasonry:\r\n\r\n     This Order was instituted by Godefroi de Bouillon in Palestine in\r\n     1330,[369] after the decadence of the Christian armies, and was\r\n     only communicated to the French Masons some time after and to a\r\n     very small number, as a reward for the obliging services they\r\n     rendered to several of our English and Scottish Knights, from whom\r\n     true Masonry is taken. Their Metropolitan Lodge is situated on the\r\n     Mountain of Heredom where the first Lodge was held in Europe and\r\n     which exists in all its splendour. The General Council is still\r\n     held there and it is the seal of the Sovereign Grand Master in\r\n     office. This mountain is situated between the West and North of\r\n     Scotland at sixty miles from Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nApart from the historical confusion of the first sentence, this passage\r\nis of interest as evidence that the theory of a connexion between\r\ncertain crusading Knights and the Lodge of Heredom of Kilwinning was\r\ncurrent as early as 1747. The Baron Tschoudy in his _Étoile\r\nFlamboyante_, which appeared in 1766, says that the crusading origin of\r\nFreemasonry is the one officially taught in the lodges, where candidates\r\nfor initiation are told that several Knights who had set forth to rescue\r\nthe holy places of Palestine from the Saracens \"formed an association\r\nunder the name of Free Masons, thus indicating that their principal\r\ndesire was the reconstruction of the Temple of Solomon,\" that, further,\r\nthey adopted certain signs, grips, and passwords as a defence against\r\nthe Saracens, and finally that \"our Society ... fraternized on the\r\nfooting of an Order with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, from\r\nwhich it is apparent that the Freemasons borrowed the custom of\r\nregarding St. John as the patron of the whole Order in general.\"[370]\r\nAfter the crusades \"the Masons kept their rites and methods and in this\r\nway perpetuated the royal art by establishing lodges, first in England,\r\nthen in Scotland,\" etc.[371]\r\n\r\nIn this account, therefore, Freemasonry is represented as having been\r\ninstituted for the defence of Christian doctrines. De Bérage expresses\r\nthe same view and explains that the object of these Crusaders in thus\r\nbinding themselves together was to protect their lives against the\r\nSaracens by enveloping their sacred doctrines in a veil of mystery. For\r\nthis purpose they made use of Jewish symbolism, which they invested with\r\na Christian meaning. Thus the Temple of Solomon was used to denote the\r\nChurch of Christ, the bough of acacia signified the Cross, the square\r\nand the compass the union between the Old and New Testaments, etc. So\r\n\"the mysteries of Masonry were in their principle, and are still,\r\nnothing else than those of the Christian religion.\"[372]\r\n\r\nBaron Tschoudy, however, declares that all this stops short of the\r\ntruth, that Freemasonry originated long before the Crusades in\r\nPalestine, and that the real \"ancestors, fathers, authors of the Masons,\r\nthose illustrious men of whom I will not say the date nor betray the\r\nsecret,\" were a \"disciplined body\" whom Tschoudy describes by the name\r\nof \"the Knights of the Aurora and Palestine.\" After \"the almost total\r\ndestruction of the Jewish people\" these \"Knights\" had always hoped to\r\nregain possession of the domains of their fathers and to rebuild the\r\nTemple, and they carefully preserved their \"regulations and particular\r\nliturgy,\" together with a \"sublime treatise\" which was the object of\r\ntheir continual study and of their philosophical speculations. Tschoudy\r\nfurther relates that they were students of the \"occult sciences,\" of\r\nwhich alchemy formed a part, and that they had \"abjured the principles\r\nof the Jewish religion in order to follow the lights of the Christian\r\nfaith.\" At the time of the Crusades the Knights of Palestine came out\r\nfrom the desert of the Thebaïd, where they had remained hidden, and\r\njoined to themselves some of the crusaders who had remained in\r\nJerusalem. Declaring that they were the descendants of the masons who\r\nhad worked on the Temple of Solomon, they professed to concern\r\nthemselves with \"speculative architecure,\" which served to disguise a\r\nmore glorious point of view. From this time they took the name of Free\r\nMasons, presented themselves under this title to the crusading armies\r\nand assembled under their banners.[373]\r\n\r\nIt would of course be absurd to regard any of the foregoing accounts as\r\nhistorical facts; the important point is that they tend to prove the\r\nfallacy of supposing that the Johannite-Templar theory originated with\r\nthe revived _Ordre du Temple_, since one corresponding to it so closely\r\nwas current in the middle of the preceding century. It is true that in\r\nthese earlier accounts the actual words \"Johannite\" and \"Templar\" do not\r\noccur, but the resemblance between the sect of Jews professing the\r\nChristian faith but possessing a \"particular liturgy\" and a \"sublime\r\ntreatise\"--apparently some early form of the Cabala--dealing with occult\r\nscience, and the Mandæans or Johannites with their Cabalistic \"Book of\r\nAdam,\" their Book of John, and their ritual, is at once apparent.\r\nFurther, the allusions to the connexion between the Knights who had been\r\nindoctrinated in the Holy Land and the Scottish lodges coincides exactly\r\nwith the Templar tradition, published not only by the _Ordre du Temple_\r\nbut handed down in the Royal Order of Scotland.\r\n\r\nFrom all this the following facts stand out: (1) that whilst British\r\nCraft Masonry traced its origin to the operative guilds of masons, the\r\nFreemasons of France from 1737 onwards placed the origin of the Order in\r\ncrusading chivalry; (2) that it was amongst these Freemasons that the\r\nupper degrees known as the Scottish Rite arose; and (3) that, as we\r\nshall now see, these degrees clearly suggest Templar inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of the upper degrees appears to have been the one\r\ngiven by de Bérage, as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Parfait Maçon Élu.\r\n    2. Élu de Perignan.\r\n    3. Élu des Quinze.\r\n    4. Petit Architecte.\r\n    5. Grand Architecte.\r\n    6. Chevalier de l'Épée et de Rose-Croix.\r\n    7. Noachite ou Chevalier Prussien.\r\n\r\nThe first of these to make its appearance is believed to have been the\r\none here assigned to the sixth place. This degree known in modern\r\nMasonry as \"Prince of the Rose-Croix of Heredom or Knight of the Pelican\r\nand Eagle\" became the eighteenth and the most important degree in what\r\nwas later called the Scottish Rite, or at the present time in England\r\nthe Ancient and Accepted Rite.\r\n\r\nWhy was this Rite called Scottish? \"It cannot be too strongly insisted\r\non,\" says Mr. Gould, \"that all Scottish Masonry has nothing whatever to\r\ndo with the Grand Lodge of Scotland, nor, with one possible\r\nexception--that of the Royal Order of Scotland--did it ever originate in\r\nthat country.\"[374] But in the case of the Rose-Croix degree there is\r\nsurely some justification for the term in legend, if not in proven fact,\r\nfor, as we have already seen, according to the tradition of the Royal\r\nOrder of Scotland this degree had been contained in it since the\r\nfourteenth century, when the degrees of H.R.M. (Heredom) and R.S.Y.C.S.\r\n(Rosy Cross) are said to have been instituted by Robert Bruce in\r\ncollaboration with the Templars after the battle of Bannockburn. Dr.\r\nMackey is one of the few Masons who admit this probable affiliation, and\r\nin referring to the tradition of the Royal Order of Scotland observes:\r\n\"From that Order it seems to us by no means improbable that the present\r\ndegree of Rose-Croix de Heredom may have taken its origin.\"[375]\r\n\r\nBut the Rose-Croix degree, like the Templar tradition from which it\r\nappears to have descended, is capable of a dual interpretation, or\r\nrather of a multiple interpretation, for no degree in Masonry has been\r\nsubject to so many variations. That on the Continent it had descended\r\nthrough the Rosicrucians in an alchemical form seems more than probable.\r\nIt would certainly be difficult to believe that a degree of R.S.Y.C.S.\r\nwas imported from the East and incorporated in the Royal Order of\r\nScotland in 1314; that by a mere coincidence a man named Christian\r\nRosenkreutz was--according to the Rosicrucian legend--born in the same\r\ncentury and transmitted a secret doctrine he had discovered in the East\r\nto the seventeenth-century Brethren of the Rosy Cross; and finally,\r\nthat a degree of the Rose-Croix was founded in circ. 1741 without any\r\nconnexion existing between these succeeding movements. Even if we deny\r\ndirect affiliation, we must surely admit a common source of inspiration\r\nproducing, if not a continuation, at any rate a periodic revival of the\r\nsame ideas. Dr. Oliver indeed admits affiliation between the\r\nseventeenth-century fraternity and the eighteenth-century degree, and\r\nafter pointing out that the first indication of the Rose-Croix degree\r\nappears in the _Fama Fraternitatis_ in 1613, goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     It was known much sooner, although not probably as a degree in\r\n     Masonry, for it existed as a cabalistic science from the earliest\r\n     times in Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as amongst the Jews and\r\n     Moors in times more recent, and in our own country the names of\r\n     Roger Bacon, Fludd, Ashmole, and many others are found in its list\r\n     of adepts.[376]\r\n\r\nDr. Mackey, quoting this passage, observes that \"Oliver confounds the\r\nmasonic Rose-Croix with the alchemical Rosicrucians,\" and proceeds to\r\ngive an account of the Rose-Croix degree as worked in England and\r\nAmerica, which he truly describes as \"in the strictest sense a Christian\r\ndegree.\"[377] But the point Dr. Mackey overlooks is that this is only\r\none version of the degree, which, as we shall see later, has been and\r\nstill is worked in a very different manner on the Continent.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, certain that the version of the Rose-Croix degree first\r\nadopted by the Freemasons of France in about 1741 was not only so\r\nChristian but so Catholic in character as to have given rise to the\r\nbelief that it was devised by the Jesuits in order to counteract the\r\nattacks of which Catholicism was the object.[378] In a paper on the\r\nAdditional Degrees Mr. J.S. Tuckett writes:\r\n\r\n     There is undeniable evidence that in their _earliest forms_ the\r\n     Ecossais or Scots Degrees were Roman Catholic; I have a MS. Ritual\r\n     in French of what I believe to be the _original_ Chev. de l'Aigle\r\n     or S∴P∴D∴R∴C∴ (Souverain Prince de Rose-Croix) and in it the New\r\n     Law is declared to be \"la foy Catholique,\" and the Baron Tschoudy\r\n     in his _L'Étoile Flamboyante_ of 1766 describes the same Degree as\r\n     \"le Catholicisme mis en grade\" (Vol. I. p. 114). I suggest that\r\n     Ecossais or Scots Masonry was intended to be a Roman Catholic as\r\n     well as a Stuart form of Freemasonry, in which none but those\r\n     devoted to both Restorations were to be admitted.[379]\r\n\r\nBut is it necessary to read this political intention into the degree? If\r\nthe tradition of the Royal Order of Scotland is to be believed, the idea\r\nof the Rose-Croix degree was far older than the Stuart cause, and dated\r\nback to Bannockburn, when the degree of Heredom with which it was\r\ncoupled was instituted in order \"to correct the errors and reform the\r\nabuses which had crept in among the three degrees of St. John's\r\nMasonry,\" and to provide a \"Christianized form of the Third Degree,\"\r\n\"purified of the dross of paganism and even of Judaism.\"[380] Whether\r\nthe antiquity attributed to these degrees can be proved or not, it\r\ncertainly appears probable that the legend of the Royal Order of\r\nScotland had some foundation in fact, and therefore that the ideas\r\nembodied in the eighteenth-century Rose-Croix degree may have been drawn\r\nfrom the store of that Order and brought by the Jacobites to France. At\r\nthe same time there is no evidence in support of the statement made by\r\ncertain Continental writers that Ramsay actually instituted this or any\r\nof the upper degrees. On the contrary, in his Oration he expressly\r\nstates that Freemasonry is composed of the Craft degrees only:\r\n\r\n     We have amongst us three kinds of brothers: Novices or Apprentices,\r\n     Fellows or Professed Brothers, Masters or Perfected Brethren. To\r\n     the first are explained the moral virtues; to the second the heroic\r\n     virtues; to the last the Christian virtues....\r\n\r\nIt might be said then that the Rose-Croix degree was here foreshadowed\r\nin the Masters' degree, in that the latter definitely inculcated\r\nChristianity. This would be perfectly in accord with Ramsay's point of\r\nview as set forth in his account of his conversion by Fénelon. When he\r\nfirst met the Archbishop of Cambrai in 1710, Ramsay relates that he had\r\nlost faith in all Christian sects and had resolved to \"take refuge in a\r\nwise Deism limited to respect for the Divinity and for the immutable\r\nideas of pure virtue,\" but that his conversation with Fénelon led him to\r\naccept the Catholic faith. And he goes on to show that \"Monsieur de\r\nCambrai turned Atheists into Deists, Deists into Christians, and\r\nChristians into Catholics by a sequence of ideas full of enlightenment\r\nand feeling.\"[381]\r\n\r\nMight not this be the process which Ramsay aimed at introducing into\r\nFreemasonry--the process which in fact does form part of the masonic\r\nsystem in England to-day, where the Atheist must become, at least by\r\nprofession, a Deist before he can be admitted to the Craft Degrees,\r\nwhilst the Rose-Croix degree is reserved solely for those who profess\r\nthe Christian faith? Such was undoubtedly the idea of the men who\r\nintroduced the Rose-Croix degree into France; and Ragon, who gives an\r\naccount of this \"Ancien Rose-Croix Francais\"--which is almost identical\r\nwith the degree now worked in England, but long since abandoned in\r\nFrance--objects to it on the very score of its Christian character.[382]\r\n\r\nIn this respect the Rose-Croix amongst all the upper degrees introduced\r\nto France in the middle of the eighteenth century stands alone, and it\r\nalone can with any probability be attributed to Scottish Jacobite\r\ninspiration. It was not, in fact, until three or four years after Lord\r\nDerwentwater or his mysterious successor Lord Harnouester[383] had\r\nresigned the Grand Mastership in favour of the Duc d'Antin in 1738 that\r\nthe additional degrees were first heard of, and it was not until eight\r\nyears after the Stuart cause had received its death-blow at Culloden,\r\nthat is to say, in 1754, that the Rite of Perfection in which the\r\nso-called Scots Degrees were incorporated was drawn up in the following\r\nform:\r\n\r\n    Rite of Perfection\r\n\r\n     1. Entered Apprentice.\r\n     2. Fellow Craft.\r\n     3. Master Mason.\r\n     4. Secret Master.\r\n     5. Perfect Master.\r\n     6. Intimate Secretary.\r\n     7. Intendant of the Buildings.\r\n     8. Provost and Judge.\r\n     9. Elect of Nine.\r\n    10. Elect of Fifteen.\r\n    11. Chief of the Twelve Tribes.\r\n    12. Grand Master Architect.\r\n    13. Knight of the Ninth Arch.\r\n    14. Ancient Grand Elect.\r\n    15. Knight of the Sword.\r\n    16. Prince of Jerusalem.\r\n    17. Knight of the East and West.\r\n    18. Rose-Croix Knight.\r\n    19. Grand Pontiff.\r\n    20. Grand Patriarch.\r\n    21. Grand Master of the Key of Masonry.\r\n    22. Prince of Libanus or Knight of the Royal Axe.\r\n    23. Sovereign Prince Adept.\r\n    24. Commander of the Black and White Eagle.\r\n    25. Commander of the Royal Secret.[384]\r\n\r\nWe have only to glance at the nomenclature of the last twenty-two of\r\nthese degrees to see that on the basis of mere operative Masonry there\r\nhas been built up a system composed of two elements: crusading chivalry\r\nand Judaic tradition. What else is this but Templarism? Even Mr. Gould,\r\nusually so reticent on Templar influence, admits it at this period:\r\n\r\n     In France ... some of the Scots lodges would appear to have very\r\n     early manufactured new degrees, connecting these very distinguished\r\n     Scots Masons with the Knights Templar, and thus given rise to the\r\n     subsequent flood of Templarism. The earliest of all are supposed to\r\n     have been the Masons of Lyons who invented the Kadosch degree,\r\n     representing the vengeance of the Templars, in 1741. From that time\r\n     new rites multiplied in France and Germany, but all those of French\r\n     origin contain Knightly, and almost all, Templar grades. In every\r\n     case the connecting link was composed of one or more Scots\r\n     degrees.[385]\r\n\r\nThe name Kadosch here mentioned is a Hebrew word signifying \"holy\" or\r\n\"consecrated,\" which in the Cabala is found in conjunction with the\r\nTetragrammaton.[386] The degree is said to have developed from that of\r\nGrand Elect,[387] one of the three \"degrees of vengeance\" celebrating\r\nwith sanguinary realism the avenging of the murder of Hiram. But in its\r\nfinal form of Knight Kadosch--later to become the thirtieth degree of\r\nthe \"Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite\"--the Hiramic legend was changed\r\ninto the history of the Templars with Jacques du Molay as the\r\nvictim.[388] So the reprobation of attack on authority personified by\r\nthe master-builder becomes approbation of attack on authority in the\r\nperson of the King of France.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the upper degrees with their political and, later\r\non, anti-Christian tendencies thus marked a complete departure from the\r\nfundamental principle of Freemasonry that \"nothing concerning the\r\nreligion or government shall ever be spoken of in the lodge.\" For this\r\nreason they have been assailed not only by anti-masonic writers but by\r\nFreemasons themselves.[389] To represent Barruel and Robison as the\r\nenemies of Freemasonry is therefore absolutely false; neither of these\r\nmen denounced Craft Masonry as practised in England, but only the\r\nsuperstructure erected on the Continent. Barruel indeed incurs the\r\nreproaches of Mounier for his championship of English Freemasons:\r\n\r\nHe vaunts their respect for religious opinion and for authority. When he\r\nspeaks of Freemasons in general they are impious, rebellious successors\r\nof the Templars and Albigenses, but _all those of England are innocent_.\r\nMore than this, all the Entered Apprentices, Fellow Crafts, and Master\r\nMasons in all parts of the world are innocent; there are only guilty\r\nones in the higher degrees, which are not essential to the institution\r\nand are sought by a small number of people.[390]\r\n\r\nIn this opinion of Barruel's a great number of Masonic writers\r\nconcur--Clavel, Ragon, Rebold, Thory, Findel, and others too numerous to\r\nmention; all indicate Craft Masonry as the only true kind and the upper\r\ndegrees as constituting a danger to the Order. Rebold, who gives a list\r\nof these writers, quotes a masonic publication, authorized by the Grand\r\nOrient and the Supreme Council of France, in which it is said that \"from\r\nall these rites there result the most foolish conceptions, ... the most\r\nabsurd legends, ... the most extravagant systems, the most immoral\r\nprinciples, and those the most dangerous for the peace and preservation\r\nof States,\" and that therefore except the first three degrees of\r\nMasonry, which are really ancient and universal, everything is \"chimera,\r\nextravagance, futility, and lies.\"[391] Did Barruel and Robison ever\r\nuse stronger language than this?\r\n\r\nTo attribute the perversion of Masonry to Jacobite influence would be\r\nabsurd. How could it be supposed that either Ramsay or Lord Derwentwater\r\n(who died as a devout Catholic on the scaffold in 1746) could have been\r\nconcerned in an attempt to undermine the Catholic faith or the monarchy\r\nof France? I would suggest, then, that the term \"Scots Masonry\" became\r\nsimply a veil for Templarism--Templarism, moreover, of a very different\r\nkind to that from which the original degree of the Rose-Croix was\r\nderived. It was this so-called Scots Masonry that, after the resignation\r\nof Lord Derwentwater, \"boldly came forward and claimed to be not merely\r\na part of Masonry but the real Masonry, possessed of superior knowledge\r\nand entitled to greater privileges and the right to rule over the\r\nordinary, i.e. Craft Masonry.\"[392] The Grand Lodge of France seems,\r\nhowever, to have realized the danger of submitting to the domination of\r\nthe Templar element, and on the death of the Duc d'Antin and his\r\nreplacement by the Comte de Clermont in 1743, signified its adherence to\r\nEnglish Craft Masonry by proclaiming itself Grande Loge _Anglaise_ de\r\nFrance and reissued the \"Constitutions\" of Anderson, first published in\r\n1723, with the injunction that the Scots Masters should be placed on the\r\nsame level as the simple Apprentices and Fellow Crafts and allowed to\r\nwear no badges of distinction.[393]\r\n\r\nGrand Lodge of England appears to have been reassured by this\r\nproclamation as to the character of French Freemasonry, for now, in\r\n1743, it at last delivered a warrant to Grand Lodge of France. Yet in\r\nreality it was from this moment that French Freemasonry degenerated the\r\nmost rapidly. The Order was soon invaded by intriguers. This was\r\nrendered all the easier by the apathy of the Comte de Clermont,\r\nappointed Grand Master in 1743, who seems to have taken little interest\r\nin the Order and employed a substitute in the person of a dancing master\r\nnamed Lacorne, a man of low character through whose influence the lodges\r\nfell into a state of anarchy. Freemasonry was thus divided into warring\r\nfactions: Lacorne and the crowd of low-class supporters who had followed\r\nhim into the lodges founded a Grand Lodge of their own (Grande Loge\r\nLacorne), and in 1756 the original Freemasons again attempted to make\r\nCraft Masonry the national Masonry of France by deleting the word\r\n\"Anglaise\" from the appellation of Grand Lodge, and renaming it \"Grand\r\nLoge Nationale de France.\" But many lodges still continue to work the\r\nadditional degrees.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the two groups became so violent that in 1767 the\r\ngovernment intervened and closed down Grand Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe Templar group had, however, formed two separate associations, the\r\n\"Knights of the East\" (1756) and the \"Council of the Emperors of the\r\nEast and West\" (1758). In 1761 a Jew named Stephen Morin was sent to\r\nAmerica by the \"Emperors\" armed with a warrant from the Duc de Clermont\r\nand Grand Lodge of Paris and bearing the sonorous title of \"Grand Elect\r\nPerfect and Sublime Master,\" with orders to establish a Lodge in that\r\ncountry. In 1766 he was accused in Grand Lodge of \"propagating strange\r\nand monstrous doctrines\" and his patent of Grand Inspector was\r\nwithdrawn.[394] Morin, however, had succeeded in establishing the Rite\r\nof Perfection. Sixteen Inspectors, nearly all Jews, were now appointed.\r\nThese included Isaac Iong, Isaac de Costa, Moses Hayes, B. Spitser,\r\nMoses Cohen, Abraham Jacobs, and Hyman Long.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in France the closing of Grand Lodge had not prevented\r\nmeetings of Lacorne's group, which, on the death of the Duc de Clermont\r\nin 1772, instituted the \"Grand Orient\" with the Duc de Chartres--the\r\nfuture \"Philippe Égalité\"--as Grand Master. The Grand Orient then\r\ninvited the Grande Loge to revoke the decree of expulsion and unite with\r\nit, and this offer being accepted, the revolutionary party inevitably\r\ncarried all before it, and the Duc de Chartres was declared Grand Master\r\nof all the councils, chapters, and Scotch lodges of France.[395] In 1782\r\nthe \"Council of Emperors\" and the \"Knights of the East\" combined to form\r\nthe \"Grand Chapitre Général de France,\" which in 1786 joined up with the\r\nGrand Orient. The victory of the revolutionary party was then complete.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to enter into all these tedious details in order to\r\nunderstand the nature of the factions grouped together under the banner\r\nof Masonry at this period. The Martinist Papus attributes the\r\nrevolutionary influences that now prevailed in the lodges to their\r\ninvasion by the Templars, and goes on to explain that this was owing to\r\na change that had taken place in the _Ordre du Temple_. Under the Grand\r\nMastership of the Regent and his successor the Duc de Bourbon, the\r\nrevolutionary elements amongst the Templars had had full play, but from\r\n1741 onwards the Grand Masters of the Order were supporters of the\r\nmonarchy. When the Revolution came, the Duc de Cossé-Brissac, who had\r\nbeen Grand Master since 1776, perished amongst the defenders of the\r\nthrone. It was thus that by the middle of the century the Order of the\r\nTemple ceased to be a revolutionary force, and the discontented elements\r\nit had contained, no longer able to find in it a refuge, threw\r\nthemselves into Freemasonry, and entering the higher degrees turned them\r\nto their subversive purpose. According to Papus, Lacorne was a member of\r\nthe Templar group, and the dissensions that took place were principally\r\na fight between the ex-Templars and the genuine Freemasons which ended\r\nin the triumph of the former:\r\n\r\n     Victorious rebels thus founded the Grand Orient of France. So a\r\n     contemporary Mason is able to write: \"It is not excessive to say\r\n     that the masonic revolution of 1773 was the prelude and the\r\n     precursor of the Revolution of 1789.\" What must be well observed is\r\n     the secret action of the Brothers of the Templar Rite. It is they\r\n     who are the real fomentors of revolution, the others are only\r\n     docile agents.[396]\r\n\r\nBut all this attributes the baneful influence of Templarism to the\r\nFrench Templars alone, and the existence of such a body rests on no\r\nabsolutely certain evidence. What is certain and admits of no denial on\r\nthe part of any historian, is the inauguration of a Templar Order in\r\nGermany at the very moment when the so-called Scottish degrees were\r\nintroduced into French Masonry. We shall now return to 1738 and follow\r\nevents that were taking place at this important moment beyond the\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nGERMAN TEMPLARISM AND FRENCH ILLUMINISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year after Ramsay's oration--that is to say in 1738--Frederick,\r\nCrown Prince of Prussia, the future Frederick the Great, who for two\r\nyears had been carrying on a correspondence with Voltaire, suddenly\r\nevinced a curiosity to know the secrets of Freemasonry which he had\r\nhitherto derided as \"Kinderspiel,\" and accordingly went through a hasty\r\ninitiation during the night of August 14-15, whilst passing through\r\nBrunswick.[397]\r\n\r\nThe ceremony took place not at a masonic lodge, but at a hotel, in the\r\npresence of a deputation summoned by the Graf von Lippe-Bückeburg from\r\nGrand Lodge of Hamburg for the occasion. It is evident that something of\r\nan unusual kind must have occurred to necessitate these speedy and\r\nmakeshift arrangements. Carlyle, in his account of the episode,\r\nendeavours to pass it off as a \"very trifling circumstance\"--a reason\r\nthe more for regarding it as of the highest importance since we know now\r\nfrom facts that have recently come to light how carefully Carlyle was\r\nspoon-fed by Potsdam whilst writing his book on Frederick the\r\nGreat.[398]\r\n\r\nBut let us follow Frederick's masonic career. In June 1740, after his\r\naccession to the throne, his interest in Masonry had clearly not waned,\r\nfor we find him presiding over a lodge at Charlottenburg, where he\r\nreceived into the Order two of his brothers, his brother-in-law, and\r\nDuke Frederick William of Holstein-Beck. At his desire the Baron de\r\nBielfeld and his privy councillor Jordan founded a lodge at Berlin, the\r\n\"Three Globes,\" which by 1746 had no less than fourteen lodges under its\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIn this same year of 1740 Voltaire, in response to urgent invitations,\r\npaid his first visit to Frederick the Great in Germany. Voltaire is\r\nusually said not to have yet become a Mason, and the date of his\r\ninitiation is supposed to have been 1778, when he was received into the\r\n_Loge des Neuf Soeurs_ in Paris. But this by no means precludes the\r\npossibility that he had belonged to another masonic Order at an earlier\r\ndate. At any rate, Voltaire's visit to Germany was followed by two\r\nremarkable events in the masonic world of France. The first of these was\r\nthe institution of the additional degrees; the second--perhaps not\r\nwholly unconnected with the first--was the arrival in Paris of a masonic\r\ndelegate from Germany named von Marschall, who brought with him\r\ninstructions for a new or rather a revived Order of Templarism, in which\r\nhe attempted to interest Prince Charles Edward and his followers.\r\n\r\nVon Marschall was followed about two years later by Baron von Hunt, who\r\nhad been initiated in 1741 into the three degrees of Craft Masonry in\r\nGermany and now came to consecrate a lodge in Paris. According to von\r\nHundt's own account, he was then received into the Order of the Temple\r\nby an unknown Knight of the Red Plume, in the presence of Lord\r\nKilmarnock,[399] and was presented as a distinguished Brother to Prince\r\nCharles Edward, whom he imagined to be Grand Master of the Order.[400]\r\nBut all this was afterwards shown to be a pure frabrication, for Prince\r\nCharles Edward dened all knowledge of the affair, and von Hundt himself\r\nadmitted later that he did not know the name of the lodge or chapter in\r\nwhich he was received, but that he was directed from \"a hidden centre\"\r\nand by Unknown Superiors, whose identity he was bound not to\r\nreveal.[401] In reality it appears that von Hundt's account was exactly\r\nthe opposite of the truth,[402] and that it was von Hundt who, seconding\r\nvon Marschall's effort, tried to enrol Prince Charles Edward in the new\r\nGerman Order by assuring him that he could raise powerful support for\r\nthe Stuart cause under the cover of reorganizing the Templar Order, of\r\nwhich he claimed to possess the true secrets handed down from the\r\nKnights of the fourteenth century. By way of further rehabilitating the\r\nOrder, von Hundt declared that all the accusations brought against it\r\nby Philippe le Bel and the Pope were based on false charges manufactured\r\nby two recreant Knights named Noffodei and Florian as a revenge for\r\nhaving been deprived of their commands by the Order in consequence of\r\ncertain crimes they had committed.[403] According to Lecouteulx de\r\nCanteleu, von Hundt eventually succeeded--after the defeat of\r\nCulloden--in persuading Prince Charles Edward to enter his Order. But\r\nthis is extremely doubtful. At any rate, when in 1751 von Hundt\r\nofficially founded his new Templar Order under the name of the _Stricte\r\nObservance_, the unfortunate Charles Edward played no part at all in the\r\nscheme. As Mr. Gould has truly observed, \"no trace of Jacobite intrigues\r\never blended with the teaching of the _Stricte Observance_.\"[404]\r\n\r\nThe _Order of the Stricte Observance_ was in reality a purely German\r\nassociation composed of men drawn entirely from the intellectual and\r\naristocratic classes, and, in imitation of the chivalric Orders of the\r\npast, known to each other under knightly titles. Thus Prince Charles of\r\nHesse became Eques a Leone Resurgente, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick Eques\r\na Victoria, the Prussian minister von Bischoffswerder Eques a Grypho,\r\nBaron de Wachter Eques a Ceraso, Christian Bode (Councillor of Legation\r\nin Saxe-Gotha) Eques a Lilio Convallium, von Haugwitz (Cabinet Minister\r\nof Frederick the Great) Eques a Monte Sancto, etc.\r\n\r\nBut according to the declarations of the Order the official leaders,\r\nKnights of the Moon, the Star, the Golden Sun, or of the Sacred\r\nMountain, were simply figure-heads; the real leaders, known as the\r\n\"Unknown Superiors,\" remained in the background, unadorned by titles of\r\nchivalry but exercising supreme jurisdiction over the Order. The system\r\nhad been foreshadowed by the \"Invisibles\" of seventeenth-century\r\nRosicrucianism; but now, instead of an intangible group whose very\r\nexistence was only known vaguely to the world, there appeared in the\r\nlight of day a powerful organization led apparently by men of influence\r\nand position yet secretly directed by hidden chiefs.[405] Mirabeau has\r\ndescribed the advent of these mysterious directors in the following\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n     In about 1756 there appeared, as if they had come out of the\r\n     ground, men sent, they said, by unknown superiors, and armed with\r\n     powers to reform the order [of Freemasonry] and re-establish it in\r\n     its ancient purity. One of these missionaries, named Johnston, came\r\n     to Weimar and Jena, where he established himself. He was received\r\n     in the best way in the world by the brothers [Freemasons], who were\r\n     lured by the hope of great secrets, of important discoveries which\r\n     were never made known to them.[406]\r\n\r\nNow, in the manuscripts of the Prince of Hesse published by Lecouteulx\r\nde Canteleu it is said that this man Johnston, or rather Johnson, who\r\nproclaimed himself to be \"Grand Prior of the Order,\" was a Jew named\r\nLeicht or Leucht.[407] Gould says that his real name was either Leucht\r\nor Becker, but that he professed to be an Englishman, although unable to\r\nspeak the English language, hence his assumption of the name\r\nJohnson.[408] Mr. Gould has described Johnson as a \"consummate rogue and\r\nan unmitigated vagabond ... of almost repulsive demeanour and of no\r\neducation, but gifted with boundless impudence and low cunning.\" Indeed,\r\nvon Hundt himself, after enlisting Johnson's services, found him too\r\ndangerous and declared him to be an adventurer. Johnson was thereupon\r\narrested by von Hundt's friend the councillor von Pritsch, and thrown\r\ninto the castle of Wartburg, where sudden death ended his career.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, improbable that Mirabeau could be right in indicating\r\nJohnson as one of the \"Unknown Superiors,\" who were doubtless men of\r\nvaster conceptions than this adventurer appears to have been. Moreover,\r\nthe manner of his end clearly proves that he occupied a subordinate\r\nposition in the _Stricte Observance_.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a very curious sequence of events which it may be\r\nwell to recapitulate briefly in order to appreciate their full\r\nsignificance:\r\n\r\n  1737. Oration of Chevalier Ramsay indicating Templar origin of\r\n        Freemasonry, but making no mention of upper degrees.\r\n\r\n  1738. Duc d'Antin becomes Grand Master of French Freemasonry in the\r\n        place of Lord \"Harnouester.\"\r\n\r\n  1738. Frederick, Crown Prince of Prussia, initiated into Masonry at\r\n        Brunswick.\r\n\r\n  1740. Voltaire pays his first visit to Frederick, now King.\r\n\r\n  1741. Baron von Marschall arrives in Paris with a plan for reviving\r\n        the Templar Order.\r\n\r\n        Templar degrees first heard of in France under name of \"Scots\r\n        Masonry.\"\r\n\r\n  1743. Arrival in France of Baron von Hundt with fresh plans for\r\n        reviving the Templar Order.\r\n\r\n        Degree of Knight Kadosch celebrating vengeance of Templars said\r\n        to have been instituted at Lyons.\r\n\r\n  1750. Voltaire goes to spend three years with Frederick.\r\n\r\n  1751. Templar Order of the Stricte Observance founded by von Hundt.\r\n\r\n  1754. Rite of Perfection (early form of Scottish Rite) founded in\r\n        France.\r\n\r\n  1761. Frederick acknowledged head of Scottish Rite.\r\n\r\n    \"   Morin sent to found Rite of Perfection in America.\r\n\r\n  1762. Grand Masonic Constitutions ratified in Berlin.[409]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen then that what Mr. Gould describes as \"the flood of\r\nTemplarism,\" which both he and Mr. Tuckett attribute to the so-called\r\nScots Masons,[410] corresponds precisely with the decline of Jacobite\r\nand the rise of German influence. Would it not therefore appear probable\r\nthat, except in the case of the Rose-Croix degree, the authors of the\r\nupper degrees were not Scotsmen nor Jacobites, that Scots Masonry was a\r\nterm used to cover not merely Templarism but more especially German\r\nTemplarism, and that the real author and inspirer of the movement was\r\nFrederick the Great? No, it is significant to find that in the history\r\nof the _Ordre du Temple_, published at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, Frederick the Great is cited as one of the most distinguished\r\nmembers of this Order in the past,[411] and the Abbé Grégoire adds that\r\nhe was \"consecrated\" at Remersberg (Rheinsberg?) in 1738, that is to say\r\nin the same year that he was initiated into Masonry at Brunswick.[412]\r\nThere is therefore a definite reason for connecting Frederick with\r\nTemplarism at this date.\r\n\r\nI would suggest, then, that the truth about the Templar succession may\r\nbe found in one of the two following theories:\r\n\r\n1. That the documents produced by the _Ordre du Temple_ in the\r\nnineteenth century, including the Charter of Larmenius, were genuine;\r\nthat the Order had never ceased to exist since the days of the Crusades;\r\nthat the Templar heresy was Johannism, but that this was not held by the\r\nTemplars who escaped to Scotland; that the Rose-Croix degree in its\r\npurely Christian form was introduced by the Scottish Templars to\r\nScotland and four hundred years later brought by Ramsay to France; that\r\nthe Master of the Temple at this date was the Regent, Philippe Duc\r\nd'Orléans, as stated in the Charter of Larmenius. Finally, that after\r\nthis, fresh Templar degrees were introduced from Germany by von Hundt,\r\nacting on behalf of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\n2. That the documents produced by the _Ordre du Temple_ in the\r\nnineteenth century were, as M. Matter declares, early eighteenth-century\r\nfabrications; that although, in view of the tradition preserved in the\r\nRoyal Order of Scotland, there appears to be good reason to believe the\r\nstory of the Scottish Templars and the origin of the Rose-Croix degree,\r\nthe rest of the history of the Templars, including the Charter of\r\nLarmenius, was an invention of the \"Concealed Superiors\" of the _Stricte\r\nObservance_ in Germany, and that the most important of these \"Concealed\r\nSuperiors\" were Frederick the Great and Voltaire.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to decide which of these two theories is correct;\r\nall that I do maintain is that in either case the preponderating rôle in\r\nTemplarism at this crisis was played by Frederick the Great, probably\r\nwith the co-operation of Voltaire, who in his _Essai sur les Mæurs_\r\nchampioned the cause of the Templars. Let us follow the reasons for\r\narriving at this conclusion.\r\n\r\nRamsay's oration in 1737 connecting Freemasonry with the Templars may\r\nwell have come to the ears of Frederick and suggested to him the idea of\r\nusing Masonry as a cover for his intrigues--hence his hasty initiation\r\nat Brunswick. But in order to acquire influence in a secret society it\r\nis always necessary to establish a claim to superior knowledge, and\r\nTemplarism seemed to provide a fruitful source of inspiration. For this\r\npurpose new light must be thrown on the Order. Now, there was probably\r\nno one better qualified than Voltaire, with his knowledge of the ancient\r\nand medieval world and hatred of the Catholic Church, to undertake the\r\nconstruction of a historical romance subversive of the Catholic\r\nfaith--hence the urgent summons to the philosopher to visit Frederick.\r\nWe can imagine Voltaire delving amongst the records of the past in order\r\nto reconstruct the Templar heresy. This was clearly Gnostic, and the\r\nMandæans or Christians of St. John may well have appeared to present the\r\nrequired characteristics. If it could be shown that here in Johannism\r\ntrue \"primitive Christianity\" was to be found, what a blow for the\r\n\"infâme\"! A skilful forger could easily be found to fabricate the\r\ndocuments said to have been preserved in the secret archives of the\r\nOrder. Further we find von Marschall arriving in the following year in\r\nFrance to reorganize the Templars, and von Hundt later claiming to be in\r\npossession of the true secrets of the Order handed down from the\r\nfourteenth century. That some documents bearing on this question were\r\neither discovered or fabricated under the direction of Frederick the\r\nGreat seems the more probable from the existence of a masonic tradition\r\nto this effect. Thus Dr. Oliver quotes a Report of the Grand\r\nInspectors-General in the nineteenth century stating that:\r\n\r\n     During the Crusades, at which 27,000 Masons were present, some\r\n     masonic MSS. of great importance were discovered among the\r\n     descendants of the ancient Jews, and that other valuable documents\r\n     were found at different periods down to the year of Light 5557\r\n     (i.e. 1553), at which time a record came to light in Syrian\r\n     characters, relating to the most remote antiquity, and from which\r\n     it would appear that the world is many thousand years older than\r\n     given by the Mosaic account. Few of these characters were\r\n     translated till the reign of our illustrious and most enlightened\r\n     Brother Frederick II, King of Prussia, whose well-known zeal for\r\n     the Craft was the cause of so much improvement in the Society over\r\n     which he condescended to preside.[413]\r\n\r\nI suggest, then, that the documents here referred to and containing the\r\nsecrets claimed by von Hundt may have been the ones afterwards published\r\nby the _Ordre du Temple_ in the nineteenth century, and that if\r\nunauthentic they were the work of Voltaire, aided probably by a Jew\r\ncapable of forging Syriac manuscripts. That Johnson was the Jew in\r\nquestion seems probable, since Findel definitely asserts that the\r\nhistory of the continuation of the Order of Knights Templar was his\r\nwork.[414] Frederick, as we know, was in the habit of employing Jews to\r\ncarry out shady transactions, and he may well have used Johnson to forge\r\ndocuments as he used Ephraim to coin false money for him. It would be\r\nfurther quite in keeping with his policy to get rid of the man as soon\r\nas he had served his purpose, lest he should betray his secrets.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, whatever were the methods employed by Frederick the Great\r\nfor obtaining control over Masonry, the fruitful results of that \"very\r\ntrifling circumstance,\" his initiation at Brunswick, become more and\r\nmore apparent as the century advances. Thus when in 1786 the Rite of\r\nPerfection was reorganized and rechristened the \"Ancient and Accepted\r\nScottish Rite\"--always the same Scottish cover for Prussianism!--it is\r\nsaid to have been Frederick who conducted operations, drew up the new\r\nConstitutions of the Order, and rearranged the degrees so as to bring\r\nthe total number up to thirty-three[415], as follows:\r\n\r\n    26. Prince of Mercy.\r\n    27. Sovereign Commander of the Temple.\r\n    28. Knight of the Sun.\r\n    29. Grand Scotch Knight of St. Andrew.\r\n    30. Grand Elect Knight of Kadosch.\r\n    31. Grand Inspector Inquisitor Commander.\r\n    32. Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret.\r\n    33. Sovereign Grand Inspector-General.\r\n\r\nIn the last four degrees Frederick the Great and Prussia play an\r\nimportant part; in the thirtieth degree of Knight Kadosch, largely\r\nmodelled on the Vehmgerichts, the Knights wear Teutonic crosses, the\r\nthrone is surmounted by the double-headed eagle of Prussia, and the\r\nPresident, who is called Thrice Puissant Grand Master, represents\r\nFrederick himself; in the thirty-second degree of Sublime Prince of the\r\nRoyal Secret, Frederick is described as the head of Continental\r\nFreemasonry; in the thirty-third degree of Sovereign Grand\r\nInspector-General the jewel is again the double-headed eagle, and the\r\nSovereign Grand Commander is Frederick, who at the time this degree was\r\ninstituted figured with Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, Grand Master of the\r\nGrand Orient, as his lieutenant. The most important of these innovations\r\nwas the thirty-second degree, which was in reality a system rather than\r\na degree for bringing together the Masons of all countries under one\r\nhead--hence the immense power acquired by Frederick. By 1786 French\r\nMasonry was thus entirely Prussianized and Frederick had indeed become\r\nthe idol of Masonry everywhere. Yet probably no one ever despised\r\nFreemasonry more profoundly. As the American Mason Albert Pike shrewdly\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n     There is no doubt that Frederick came to the conclusion that the\r\n     great pretensions of Masonry in the blue degrees were merely\r\n     imaginary and deceptive. He ridiculed the Order, and thought its\r\n     ceremonies mere child's play; and some of his sayings to that\r\n     effect have been preserved. It does not at all follow that he might\r\n     not at a later day have found it politic to put himself at the head\r\n     of an Order that had become a power....[416]\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance to find that in the year following the\r\nofficial foundation of the _Stricte Observance_, that is to say in 1752,\r\nLord Holdernesse, in a letter to the British Ambassador in Paris, Lord\r\nAlbemarle, headed \"Very secret,\" speaks of \"the influence which the King\r\nof Prussia has of late obtained over all the French Councils\"; and a few\r\nweeks later Lord Albemarle refers to \"the great influence of the\r\nPrussian Court over the French Councils by which they are so blinded as\r\nnot to be able to judge for themselves.\"[417]\r\n\r\nBut it is time to turn to another sphere of activity which Masonry\r\nopened out to the ambitions of Frederick.\r\n\r\nThe making of the _Encyclopédie_, which even those writers the most\r\nsceptical with regard to secret influences behind the revolutionary\r\nmovement admit to have contributed towards the final cataclysm, is a\r\nquestion on which official history has thrown but little light.\r\nAccording to the authorized version of the story--as related, for\r\nexample, in Lord Morley's work on the Encyclopædists--the plan of\r\ntranslating Ephraim Chambers's _Cyclopædia_, which had appeared in 1728,\r\nwas suggested to Diderot \"some fifteen years later\" by a French\r\nbookseller named Le Breton. Diderot's \"fertile and energetic\r\nintelligence transformed the scheme.... It was resolved to make\r\nChambers's work a mere starting-point for a new enterprise of far wider\r\nscope.\" We then go on to read of the financial difficulties that now\r\nbeset the publisher, of the embarrassment of Diderot, who \"felt himself\r\nunequal to the task of arranging and supervising every department of a\r\nnew book that was to include the whole circle of the sciences,\" of the\r\nfortunate enlisting of d'Alembert as a collaborator, and later of men\r\nbelonging to all kinds of professions, \"all united in a work that was as\r\nuseful as it was laborious, without any view of interest ... without any\r\ncommon understanding and agreement,\" further, of the cruel persecutions\r\nencountered at the hands of the Jesuits, \"who had expected at least to\r\nhave control of the articles on theology,\" and finally of the tyrannical\r\nsuppression of the great work on account of the anti-Christian\r\ntendencies these same articles displayed.[418]\r\n\r\nNow for a further light on the matter.\r\n\r\nIn the famous speech of the Chevalier Ramsay already quoted, which was\r\ndelivered at Grand Lodge of Paris in 1737, the following passage occurs:\r\n\r\n     The fourth quality required in our Order is the taste for useful\r\n     sciences and the liberal arts. Thus, the Order exacts of each of\r\n     you to contribute, by his protection, liberality, or labour, to a\r\n     vast work for which no academy can suffice, because all these\r\n     societies being composed of a very small number of men, their work\r\n     cannot embrace an object so extended. All the Grand Masters in\r\n     Germany, England, Italy, and elsewhere exhort all the learned men\r\n     and all the artisans of the Fraternity to unite to furnish the\r\n     materials for a Universal Dictionary of all the liberal arts and\r\n     useful sciences; excepting only theology and politics. The work has\r\n     already been commenced in London, and by means of the unions of our\r\n     brothers it may be carried to a conclusion in a few years.[419]\r\n\r\nSo after all it was no enterprising bookseller, no brilliantly inspired\r\nphilosopher, who conceived the idea of the _Encyclopédie_, but a\r\npowerful international organization able to employ the services of more\r\nmen than all the academies could supply, which devised the scheme at\r\nleast six years before the date at which it is said to have occurred to\r\nDiderot. Thus the whole story as usually told to us would appear to be a\r\ncomplete fabrication--struggling publishers, toiling _littérateurs_\r\ncarrying out their superhuman task as \"independent men of letters\"\r\nwithout the patronage of the great--which Lord Morley points out as \"one\r\nof the most important facts in the history of the Encyclopædia\"--writers\r\nof all kinds bound together by no \"common understanding or agreement,\"\r\nare all seen in reality to have been closely associated as \"artisans of\r\nthe Fraternity\" carrying out the orders of their superiors.\r\n\r\nThe _Encyclopédie_ was therefore essentially a Masonic publication, and\r\nPapus, whilst erroneously attributing the famous oration and\r\nconsequently the plan of the _Encyclopédie_ to the inspiration of the\r\nDuc d'Antin, emphasizes the importance of this fact. Thus, he writes:\r\n\r\n     The Revolution manifests itself by two stages:\r\n\r\n     1st. _Intellectual revolution_, by the publication of the\r\n     _Encyclopédie_, due to French Freemasonry under the high\r\n     inspiration of the Duc d'Antin.\r\n\r\n     2nd. _Occult revolution_ in the Lodges, due in great part to the\r\n     members of the Templar Rite and executed by a group of expelled\r\n     Freemasons afterwards amnestied.[420]\r\n\r\nThe masonic authorship of the _Encyclopédie_ and the consequent\r\ndissemination of revolutionary doctrines has remained no matter of doubt\r\nto the Freemasons of France; on the contrary, they glory in the fact. At\r\nthe congress of the Grand Orient in 1904 the Freemason Bonnet declared:\r\n\r\n     In the eighteenth century the glorious line of Encyclopædists\r\n     formed in our temples a fervent audience which was then alone in\r\n     invoking the radiant device as yet unknown to the crowd: \"Liberty,\r\n     Equality, Fraternity.\" The revolutionary seed quickly germinated\r\n     amidst this _élite_. Our illustrious Freemasons d'Alembert,\r\n     Diderot, Helvétius, d'Holbach, Voltaire, Condorcet, completed the\r\n     evolution of minds and prepared the new era. And, when the Bastille\r\n     fell, Freemasonry had the supreme honour of giving to humanity the\r\n     charter (i.e. the Declaration of the Rights of Man) which it had\r\n     elaborated with devotion. (_Applause_.)\r\n\r\nThis charter, the orator went on to say, was the work of the Freemason\r\nLafayette, and was adopted by the Constituent Assembly, of which more\r\nthan 300 members were Freemasons.\r\n\r\nBut in using the lodges to sow the seeds of revolution, the\r\nEncyclopædists betrayed not only the cause of monarchy but of Masonry as\r\nwell. It will be noticed that, in conformity with true masonic\r\nprinciples, Ramsay in his oration expressly stated that the encyclopædia\r\nwas to concern itself with the liberal arts and sciences[421] and that\r\ntheology and politics were to be excluded from the contemplated scheme.\r\nHow, then, did it come to pass that these were eventually the two\r\nsubjects to which the Encyclopædists devoted the greatest attention, so\r\nthat their work became principally an attack on Church and monarchy? If\r\nPapus was right in attributing this revolutionary tendency to the\r\n_Encyclopédie_ from the time of the famous oration, then Ramsay could\r\nonly be set down as the profoundest hypocrite or as the mouthpiece of\r\nhypocrites professing intentions the very reverse of their real designs.\r\nA far more probable explanation seems to be that during the interval\r\nbetween Ramsay's speech and the date when the _Encyclopédie_ was begun\r\nin earnest, the scheme underwent a change. It will be noticed that the\r\nyear of 1746, when Diderot and d'Alembert are said to have embarked on\r\ntheir task, coincided with the decadence of French Freemasonry under the\r\nComte de Clermont and the invasion of the lodges by the subversive\r\nelements; thus the project propounded with the best intentions by the\r\nFreemasons of 1737 was filched by their revolutionary successors and\r\nturned to a diametrically opposite purpose.\r\n\r\nBut it is not to the dancing-master Lacorne and his middle-class\r\nfollowing that we can attribute the efficiency with which not only the\r\n_Encyclopédie_ but a host of minor revolutionary publications were\r\ncirculated all over France. Frederick the Great had seen his\r\nopportunity. If I am right in my surmise that Ramsay's speech had\r\nreached the ears of Frederick, the prospect of the _Encyclopédie_\r\ncontained therein may well have appeared to him a magnificent method for\r\nobtaining a footing in the intellectual circles of France; hence then,\r\ndoubtless, an additional reason for his hasty initiation into Masonry,\r\nhis summons to Voltaire, and his subsequent overtures to Diderot and\r\nd'Alembert, who, by the time the first volume of the _Encyclopédie_\r\nappeared in 1751, had both been made members of the Royal Academy of\r\nPrussia. In the following year Frederick offered d'Alembert the\r\npresidency of the Academy in place of Maupertuis, an offer which was\r\nrefused; but in 1755 and again in 1763 d'Alembert visited Frederick in\r\nGermany and received his pension regularly from Berlin. It is therefore\r\nnot surprising that when the _Encyclopédie_ had reached the letter P, it\r\nincluded, in an unsigned article on Prussia, a panegyric on the virtues\r\nand the talents of the illustrious monarch who presided over the\r\ndestinies of that favoured country.\r\n\r\nThe art of Frederick the Great, as of his successors on the throne of\r\nthe Hohenzollerns, was to make use of every movement that could further\r\nthe design of Prussian supremacy. He used the Freemasons as he used the\r\nphilosophers and as he used the Jews, to carry out his great scheme--the\r\ndestruction of the French monarchy and of the alliance between France\r\nand Austria. Whilst through his representatives at the Court of France\r\nhe was able to create discord between Versailles and Vienna and bring\r\ndiscredit on Marie Antoinette, through his allies in the masonic lodges\r\nand in the secret societies he was able to reach the people of France.\r\nThe gold and the printing presses of Frederick the Great were added to\r\nthose of the Orléanistes for the circulation of seditious literature\r\nthroughout the provinces.[422]\r\n\r\nSo as the century advanced the association founded by Royalists and\r\nCatholics was turned into an engine of destruction by revolutionary\r\nintriguers; the rites and symbols were gradually perverted to an end\r\ndirectly opposed to that for which they had been instituted, and the two\r\ndegrees of Rose-Croix and Knight Kadosch came to symbolize respectively\r\nwar on religion and war on the monarchy of France.\r\n\r\nIt is no orthodox Catholic but an occultist and Rosicrucian who thus\r\ndescribes the rôle of Masonry in the Revolution:\r\n\r\n     Masonry has not only been profaned but it has been served as a\r\n     cover and pretext for the plots of anarchy, by the occult influence\r\n     of the avengers of Jacques du Molay and the continuers of the\r\n     schismatic work of the Temple. Instead of avenging the death of\r\n     Hiram, they have avenged his assassins. The anarchists have taken\r\n     the plumb-line, the square, and the mallet and have written on them\r\n     liberty, equality, fraternity. That is to say, liberty for\r\n     envyings, equality in degradation, fraternity for destruction.\r\n     Those are the men whom the Church has justly condemned and that she\r\n     will always condemn.[423]\r\n\r\nBut it is time to turn to another masonic power which meanwhile had\r\nentered the lists, the Martinistes or French Illuminés.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench Illuminism\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst Frederick the Great, the Freemasons, the Encyclopædists, and the\r\nOrléanistes were working on the material plane to undermine the Church\r\nand monarchy in France, another cult had arisen which by the middle of\r\nthe century succeeded in insinuating itself into the lodges. This was a\r\nrecrudescence of the old craze for occultism, which now spread like\r\nwildfire all over Europe from Bordeaux to St. Petersburg. During the\r\nreign of Anna of Courland (1730-40) the Russian Court was permeated with\r\nsuperstition, and professional magicians and charlatans of every kind\r\nwere encouraged. The upper classes of Germany in the eighteenth century\r\nproved equally susceptible to the attractions of the supernatural, and\r\nprinces desirous of long life or greater power eagerly pursued the quest\r\nof the Philosopher's Stone, the \"Elixir of Life,\" and evoked spirits\r\nunder the direction of occultists in their service.\r\n\r\nIn France occultism, reduced to a system, adopted the outer forms of\r\nMasonry as a cover to the propagation of its doctrines. It was in 1754\r\nthat Martines de Pasqually (or Paschalis), a Rose-Croix Mason,[424]\r\nfounded his Order of Élus Cohens (Elected Priests), known later as the\r\n_Martinistes_ or the French _Illuminés_. Although brought up in the\r\nChristian faith, Pasqually has been frequently described as a Jew. The\r\nBaron de Gleichen, himself a Martiniste and a member of the Amis\r\nRéunis,[425] throws an interesting light on the matter in this passage:\r\n\"Pasqualis was originally Spanish, perhaps of the Jewish race, since\r\nhis disciples inherited from him a large number of Jewish\r\nmanuscripts.\"[426]\r\n\r\nIt was \"this Cabalistic sect,\"[427] the Martinistes, which now became\r\nthe third great masonic power in France.\r\n\r\nThe rite of the Martinistes was broadly divided into two classes, in the\r\nfirst of which was represented the fall of man and in the second his\r\nfinal restoration--a further variation on the masonic theme of a loss\r\nand a recovery. After the first three Craft degrees came the Cohen\r\ndegrees of the same--Apprentice Cohen, Fellow Craft Cohen, and Master\r\nCohen--then those of Grand Architect, Grand Elect of Zerubbabel or\r\nKnight of the East: but above these were concealed degrees leading up to\r\nthe Rose-Croix, which formed the capstone of the edifice.[428] Pasqually\r\nfirst established his rite at Marseilles, Toulouse, and Bordeaux, then\r\nin Paris, and before long Martiniste lodges spread all over France with\r\nthe centre at Lyons under the direction of Willermoz, a prosperous\r\nmerchant living there. From this moment other occult Orders sprang up in\r\nall directions. In 1760 Dom Pernetti founded his sect of \"Illuminés\r\nd'Avignon\" in that city, declaring himself a high initiate of\r\nFreemasonry and teaching the doctrines of Swedenborg. Later a certain\r\nChastanier founded the \"Illuminés Théosophes,\" a modified version of\r\nPernetti's rite; and in 1783 the Marquis de Thomé started a purified\r\nvariety of Swedenborgianism under the name of \"Rite of Swedenborg.\"\r\n\r\nBeneath all these occult sects one common source of inspiration is to be\r\nfound--the perverted and magical Cabala of the Jews, that conglomeration\r\nof wild theosophical imaginings and barbaric superstitions founded on\r\nancient pagan cults and added to throughout seventeen centuries by\r\nsucceeding generations of Jewish occultists.[429] This influence is\r\nparticularly to be detected in the various forms of the Rose-Croix\r\ndegree, which in nearly all these associations forms the highest and\r\nmost secret degree. The ritual of \"the eminent Order of the Knights of\r\nthe Black Eagle or Sovereigns of the Rose-Croix,\" a secret and\r\nunpublished document of the eighteenth century, which differs entirely\r\nfrom the published rituals, explains that no one can attain to knowledge\r\nof the higher sciences without the \"Clavicules de Salomon,\" of which\r\nthe real secrets were never committed to print and which is said to\r\ncontain the whole of Cabalistic science.[430] The catechism of this same\r\ndegree deals mainly with the transmutation of metals, the Philosopher's\r\nStone, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Rite of Perfection as worked in France and America this\r\nCabalistic influence is shown in those degrees known under the name of\r\nthe \"Ineffable Degrees,\" derived from the Jewish belief in the mystery\r\nthat surrounds the Ineflable Name of God. According to the custom of the\r\nJews, the sacred name Jehovah or Jah-ve, composed of the four letters\r\nyod, he, vau, he, which formed the Tetragrammaton, was never to be\r\npronounced by the profane, who were obliged to substitute for it the\r\nword \"Adonai.\" The Tetragrammaton might only be uttered once a year on\r\nthe Day of Atonement by the High Priest in the Holy of Holies amid the\r\nsound of trumpets and cymbals, which prevented the people from hearing\r\nit. It is said that in consequence of the people thus refraining from\r\nits utterance, the true pronunciation of the name was at last lost. The\r\nJews further believed that the Tetragrammaton was possessed of unbounded\r\npowers. \"He who pronounces it shakes heaven and earth and inspires the\r\nvery angels with astonishment and terror.\"[431] The Ineffable Name thus\r\nconferred miraculous gifts; it was engraved on the rod of Moses and\r\nenabled him to perform wonders, just as, according to the Toledot Yeshu,\r\nit conferred the same powers on Christ.\r\n\r\nThis superstition was clearly a part of Rosicrucian tradition, for the\r\nsymbol of the Tetragrammaton within a triangle, adopted by the masonic\r\nlodges, figures in Fludd's Cabalistic system.[432] In the \"Ineffable\r\ndegrees\" it was invested with all the mystic awe by which it is\r\nsurrounded in Jewish theology, and, according to early American working:\r\n\"Brothers and Companions of these degrees received the name of God as it\r\nwas revealed to Enoch and were sworn to pronounce it but once in their\r\nlives.\"\r\n\r\nIn the alchemical version of the Rose-Croix degree referred to above the\r\nIneffable Name is actually invested with magical powers as in the\r\nJewish Cabala. Ragon, after describing the Jewish ceremony when the word\r\nJehovah was pronounced by the High Priest in the Holy of Holies, goes on\r\nto say that \"Schem-hamm-phorasch,\" another term for the Tetragrammaton,\r\nforms the sacred word of a Scotch degree, and that this belief in its\r\nmystic properties \"will be found at the head of the instructions for the\r\nthird degree of the Knight of the Black Eagle, called Rose-Croix,\" thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Q. What is the most powerful name of God on the pentaculum?\r\n     A. Adonai.\r\n     Q. What is its power?\r\n     A. To move the Universe.\r\n\r\n     That one of the Knights who had the good fortune to pronounce it\r\n     cabalistically would have at his disposal the powers that inhabit\r\n     the four elements and the celestial spirits, and would possess all\r\n     the virtues possible to man.[433]\r\n\r\nThat this form of the Rose-Croix was of purely Jewish origin is thus\r\nclearly evident. In the address to the candidate for initiation into the\r\nRose-Croix degree at the Lodge of the \"Contrat Social\" it is stated:\r\n\r\n     This degree, which includes an Order of Perfect Masons, was brought\r\n     to light by Brother R., who took it from the Kabbalistic treasure\r\n     of the Doctor and Rabbi Néamuth, chief of the synagogue of Leyden\r\n     in Holland, who had preserved its precious secrets and its costume,\r\n     both of which we shall see in the same order in which he placed\r\n     them in his mysterious Talmud.[434]\r\n\r\nNow, we know that in the eighteenth century a society of Rosicrucian\r\nmagicians had been instituted in Florence which was believed to date\r\nback to the fifteenth century and to have been partly, if not wholly\r\ncomposed of Orientals, as we shall see in the next chapter; but it seems\r\nprobable that this sect, whilst secretly inspiring the Rose-Croix\r\nmasons, was itself either nameless or concealed under a disguise. Thus\r\nin 1782 an English Freemason writes: \"I have found some rather curious\r\nMSS. in Algiers in Hebrew relating to the society of the Rosicrucians,\r\nwhich exists at present under another name with the same forms. I hope,\r\nmoreover to be admitted to their knowledge.\"[435]\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been argued that Jews can have played no part in\r\nFreemasonry at this period since they themselves were not admitted to\r\nthe lodges. But this is by no means certain; in the article from _The\r\nGentleman's Magazine_ already quoted it is stated that Jews are\r\nadmitted; de Luchet further quotes the instance of David Moses Hertz\r\nreceived in a London lodge in 1787; and the author of _Les Franc-Masons\r\nécrasés_, published in 1746, states that he has seen three Jews received\r\ninto a lodge at Amsterdam. In the \"Melchisedeck Lodges\" of the Continent\r\nnon-Christians were openly admitted, and here again the Rose-Croix\r\ndegree occupies the most important place. The highest degrees of this\r\nrite were the Initiated Brothers of Asia, the Masters of the Wise, and\r\nthe Royal Priests, otherwise known as the degree of Melchisedeck or the\r\ntrue Brothers of the Rose-Croix.\r\n\r\nThis Order, usually described as the _Asiatic Brethren_, of which the\r\ncentre was in Vienna and the leader a certain Baron von Eckhoffen, is\r\nsaid to have been a continuation of the \"Brothers of the Golden and Rosy\r\nCross,\" a revival of the seventeenth-century Rosicrucians organized in\r\n1710 by a Saxon priest, Samuel Richter, known as Sincerus Renatus. The\r\nreal origins of the Asiatic Brethren are, however, obscure and little\r\nliterature on the subject is to be found in this country.[436] Their\r\nfurther title of \"the Knights and Brethren of St. John the Evangelist\"\r\nsuggests Johannite inspiration and was clearly an imposture, since they\r\nincluded Jews, Turks, Persians, and Armenians. De Luchet, who as a\r\ncontemporary was in a position to acquire first-hand information, thus\r\ndescribes the organization of the Order, which, it will be seen, was\r\nentirely Judaic. \"The superior direction is called the small and\r\nconstant Sanhedrim of Europe. The names of those employed by which they\r\nconceal themselves from their inferiors are Hebrew. The signs of the\r\nthird principal degree (i.e. the Rose-Croix) are Urim and Thummim....\r\nThe Order has the true secrets and the explanations, moral and\r\nphysical, of the hierogyphics of the very venerable Order of\r\nFreemasonry.\"[437] The initiate had to swear absolute submission and\r\nunswerving obedience to the laws of the Order and to follow its laws\r\nimplicitly to the end of his life, without asking by whom they were\r\ngiven or whence they came.\r\n\r\n\"Who,\" asks de Luchet, \"gave to the Order these so-called secrets? That\r\nis the great and insidious question for the secret societies. But the\r\nInitiate who remains, and must remain eternally in the Order, never\r\nfinds this out, he dare not even ask it, he must promise never to ask\r\nit. In this way those who participate in the secrets of the Order remain\r\nthe Masters.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, as in the _Stricte Observance_, the same system of \"Concealed\r\nSuperiors\"--the same blind obedience to unknown directors!\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of these various sects of Illuminés a wave of\r\noccultism swept over France, and lodges everywhere became centres of\r\ninstruction on the Cabala, magic, divination, alchemy, and\r\ntheosophy[438]; masonic rites degenerated into ceremonies for the\r\nevocation of spirits--women, who were now admitted to these assemblies,\r\nscreamed, fainted, fell into convulsions, and lent themselves to\r\nexperiments of the most horrible kind.[439]\r\n\r\nBy means of these occult practices the _Illuminés_ in time became the\r\nthird great masonic power in France, and the rival Orders perceived the\r\nexpediency of joining forces. Accordingly in 1771 an amalgamation of all\r\nthe masonic groups was effected at the new lodge of the _Amis Réunis_.\r\n\r\nThe founder of this lodge was Savalette de Langes, Keeper of the Royal\r\nTreasury, Grand Officer of the Grand Orient, and a high initiate of\r\nMasonry--\"versed in all mysteries, in all the lodges, and in all the\r\nplots.\" In order to unite them he made his lodge a mixture of all\r\nsophistic, Martiniste, and masonic systems, \"and as a bait to the\r\naristocracy organized balls and concerts at which the adepts, male and\r\nfemale, danced and feasted, or sang of the beauties of their liberty\r\nand equality, little knowing that above them was a secret committee\r\nwhich was arranging to extend this equality beyond the lodge to rank and\r\nfortune, to castles and to cottages, to marquesses and bourgeois\"\r\nalike.[440]\r\n\r\nA further development of the Amis Réunis was the Rite of the\r\n_Philalèthes_, compounded by Savalette de Langes in 1773 out of\r\nSwedenborgian, Martiniste, and Rosicrucian mysteries, into which the\r\nhigher initiates of the Amis Réunis--Court de Gebelin, the Prince de\r\nHesse, Condorcet, the Vicomte de Tavannes, Willermoz, and others--were\r\ninitiated. A modified form of this rite was instituted at Narbonne in\r\n1780 under the name of \"Free and Accepted Masons du Rit Primitif,\" the\r\nEnglish nomenclature being adopted (according to Clavel) in order to\r\nmake it appear that the rite emanated from England. In reality its\r\nfounder, the Marquis de Chefdebien d'Armisson, a member of the Grand\r\nOrient and of the Amis Réunis, drew his inspiration from certain German\r\nFreemasons with whom he maintained throughout close relations and who\r\nwere presumably members of the Stricte Observance, since Chefdebien was\r\na member of this Order, in which he bore the title of \"Eques a Capite\r\nGaleato.\" The correspondence that passed between Chefdebien and\r\nSalvalette de Langes, recently discovered and published in France, is\r\none of the most illuminating records of the masonic ramifications in\r\nexistence before the Revolution ever brought to light.[441] To judge by\r\nthe tone of these letters, the leaders of the Rit Primitif would appear\r\nto have been law-abiding and loyal gentlemen devoted to the Catholic\r\nreligion, yet in their passion for new forms of Masonry and thirst for\r\noccult lore ready to associate themselves with every kind of adventurer\r\nand charlatan who might be able to initiate them into further mysteries.\r\nIn the curious notes drawn up by Savalette for the guidance of the\r\nMarquis de Chefdebien we catch a glimpse of the power behind the\r\nphilosophers of the _salons_ and the aristocratic adepts of the\r\nlodges--the professional magicians and men of mystery; and behind these\r\nagain the concealed directors of the secret societies, the _real\r\ninitiates_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Magicians\r\n\r\n\r\nThe part played by magicians during the period preceding the French\r\nRevolution is of course a matter of common knowledge and has never been\r\ndisputed by official history. But like the schools of philosophers this\r\nsudden crop of magicians is always represented as a sporadic growth\r\ncalled into being by the idle and curious society of the day. The\r\nimportant point to realize is that just as the philosophers were all\r\nFreemasons, the principal magicians were not only Freemasons but members\r\nof occult secret societies. It is therefore not as isolated charlatans\r\nbut as agents of some hidden power that we must regard the men whom we\r\nwill now pass in a rapid survey.\r\n\r\nOne of the first to appear in the field was Schroepfer, a coffee-house\r\nkeeper of Leipzig, who declared that no one could be a true Freemason\r\nwithout practising magic. Accordingly he proclaimed himself the\r\n\"reformer of Freemasonry,\" and set up a lodge in his own house with a\r\nrite based on the Rose-Croix degree for the purpose of evoking spirits.\r\nThe meetings took place at dead of night, when by means of carefully\r\narranged lights, magic mirrors, and possibly of electricity, Schroepfer\r\ncontrived to produce apparitions which his disciples--under the\r\ninfluence of strong punch--took to be visitors from the other\r\nworld.[442] In the end Schroepfer, driven crazy by his own incantations,\r\nblew out his brains in a garden near Leipzig.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lecouteulx de Canteleu, it was Schroepfer who indoctrinated\r\nthe famous \"Comte de Saint-Germain\"--\"The Master\" of our modern\r\nco-masonic lodges. The identity of this mysterious personage has never\r\nbeen established[443]; by some contemporaries he was said to be a\r\nnatural son of the King of Portugal, by others the son of a Jew and a\r\nPolish Princess. The Duc de Choiseul on being asked whether he knew the\r\norigin of Saint-Germain replied: \"No doubt we know it, he is the son of\r\na Portuguese Jew who exploits the credulity of the town and Court.\"[444]\r\nIn 1780 a rumour went round that his father was a Jew of Bordeaux,\r\nbut according to the _Souvenirs of the Marquise de Créquy_ the Baron de\r\nBreteuil discovered from the archives of his Ministry that the pretended\r\nComte de Saint-Germain was the son of a Jewish doctor of Strasburg, that\r\nhis real name was Daniel Wolf, and that he was born in 1704.[445] The\r\ngeneral opinion thus appears to have been in favour of his Jewish\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\nSaint-German seems first to have been heard of in Germany about 1740,\r\nwhere his marvellous powers attracted the attention of the Maréchal de\r\nBelle-Isle, who, always the ready dupe of charlatans, brought him back\r\nwith him to the Court of France, where he speedily gained the favour of\r\nMadame de Pompadour. The Marquise before long presented him to the King,\r\nwho granted him an apartment at Chambord and, enchanted by his brilliant\r\nwit, frequently spent long evenings in conversation with him in the\r\nrooms of Madame de Pompadour. Meanwhile his invention of flat-bottomed\r\nboats for the invasion of England raised him still higher in the\r\nestimation of the Maréchal de Belle-Isle. In 1761 we hear of him as\r\nliving in great splendour in Holland and giving out that he had reached\r\nthe age of seventy-four, though appearing to be only fifty; if this were\r\nso, he must have been ninety-seven at the time of his death in 1784 at\r\nSchleswig. But this feat of longevity is far from satisfying his modern\r\nadmirers, who declare that Saint-Germain did not die in 1784, but is\r\nstill alive to-day in some corner of Eastern Europe. This is in\r\naccordance with the theory, said to have been circulated by\r\nSaint-Germain himself, that by the eighteenth century he had passed\r\nthrough several incarnations and that the last one had continued for\r\n1,500 years. Barruel, however, explains that Saint-Germain in thus\r\nreferring to his age spoke in masonic language, in which a man who has\r\ntaken the first degree is said to be three years old, after the second\r\nfive, or the third seven, so that by means of the huge increase the\r\nhigher degrees conferred it might be quite possible for an exalted adept\r\nto attain the age of 1,500.\r\n\r\nSaint-Germain has been represented by modern writers--not only those who\r\ncompose his following--as a person of extraordinary attainments, a sort\r\nof super-man towering over the minor magicians of his day.\r\nContemporaries, however, take him less seriously and represent him\r\nrather as an expert charlatan whom the wits of the _salons_ made the\r\nbutt of pleasantries. His principal importance to the subject of this\r\nbook consists, however, in his influence on the secret societies.\r\nAccording to the _Mémoires authentiques pour servir à l'histoire du\r\nComte de Cagliostro_, Saint-Germain was the \"Grand Master of\r\nFreemasonry,\"[446] and it was he who initiated Cagliostro into the\r\nmysteries of Egyptian masonry.\r\n\r\nJoseph Balsamo, born in 1743, who assumed the name of Comte de\r\nCagliostro, as a magician far eclipsed his master. Like Saint-Germain,\r\nhe was generally reputed to be a Jew--the son of Pietro Balsamo, a\r\nSicilian tradesman of Jewish origin[447]--and he made no secret of his\r\narden admiration for the Jewish race. After the death of his parents he\r\nescaped from the monastery in which he had been placed at Palermo and\r\njoined himself to a man known as Altotas, said to have been an Armenian,\r\nwith whom he travelled to Greece and Egypt[448]. Cagliostro's travels\r\nlater took him to Poland and Germany, where he was initiated into\r\nFreemasonry[449], and finally to France; but it was in England that he\r\nhimself declared that he elaborated his famous \"Egyptian Rite,\" which he\r\nfounded officially in 1782. According to his own account, this rite was\r\nderived from a manuscript by a certain George Cofton--whose identity has\r\nnever been discovered--which he bought by chance in London[450]. Yarker,\r\nhowever, expresses the opinion that \"the rite of Cagliostro was clearly\r\nthat of Pasqually,\" and that if he acquired it from a manuscript in\r\nLondon it would indicate that Pasquilly had disciples in that city. A\r\nfar more probable explanation is that Cagliostro derived his Egyptian\r\nmasonry from the same source as that on which Pasqually had drawn for\r\nhis Order of Martinistes, namely the Cabala, and that it was not from a\r\nsingle manuscript but from an eminent Jewish Cabalist in London that he\r\ntook his instructions. Who this may have been we shall soon see. At any\r\nrate, in a contemporary account of Cagliostro we find him described as\r\n\"a doctor initiated into Cabalistic art\" and a Rose-Croix; but after\r\nfounding his own rite he acquired the name of Grand Copht, that is to\r\nsay, Supreme Head of Egyptian Masonry, a new branch that he wished to\r\ngraft on to old European Freemasonry.[451] We shall return to his\r\nfurther masonic adventures later.\r\n\r\nIn a superior category to Saint-German and Cagliostro was the famous\r\nSwabian doctor Mesmer, who has given his name to an important branch of\r\nnatural science. In about 1780 Mesmer announced his great discovery of\r\n\"animal magnetism, the principle of life in all organized beings, the\r\nsoul of all that breathes.\" But if to-day Mesmerism has come to be\r\nregarded as almost synonymous with hypnotism and in no way a branch of\r\noccultism, Mesmer himself--stirring the fluid in his magic bucket,\r\naround which his disciples wept, slept, fell into trances or\r\nconvulsions, raved or prophesied[452]--earned not unnaturally the\r\nreputation of a charlatan. The Freemasons, eager to discover the secret\r\nof the magic bucket, hastened to enrol him in their Order, and Mesmer\r\nwas received into the Primitive Rite of Free and Accepted Masons in\r\n1785.[453]\r\n\r\nSpace forbids a description of the minor magicians who flourished at\r\nthis period--of _Schroeder_, founder in 1776 of a chapter of \"True and\r\nAncient Rose-Croix Masons,\" practising certain magical, theosophical,\r\nand alchemical degrees; of _Gassner_, worker of miracles in the\r\nneighbourhood of Ratisbonne; of \"the Jew Leon,\" one of a band of\r\ncharlatans who made large sums of money with magic mirrors in which the\r\nimaginative were able to see their absent friends, and who was finally\r\nbanished from France by the police,--all these and many others exploited\r\nthe credulity and curiosity of the upper classes both in France and\r\nGermany between the years of 1740 and 1790. De Luchet, writing before\r\nthe French Revolution, describes the part played in their mysteries by\r\nthe soul of a Cabalistic Jew named Gablidone who had lived before\r\nChrist, and who predicted that \"in the year 1800 there will be, on our\r\nglobe, a very remarkable revolution, and there will be no other religion\r\nbut that of the patriarchs.\"[454]\r\n\r\nHow are we to account for this extraordinary wave of Cabalism in Western\r\nEurope? By whom was it inspired? If, as Jewish writers assure us,\r\nneither Marlines Pasqually, Saint-Germain, Cagliostro, nor any of the\r\nvisible occultists or magicians were Jews, the problem only becomes the\r\nmore insoluble. We cannot believe that Sanhedrims, Hebrew hieroglyphics,\r\nthe contemplation of the Tetragrammaton, and other Cabalistic rites\r\noriginated in the brains of French and German aristocrats, philosophers,\r\nand Freemasons. Let us turn, then, to events taking place at this moment\r\nin the world of Jewry and see whether these may provide some clue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH CABALISTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the preceding chapters that the Jewish Cabala\r\nplayed an important part in the occult and anti-Christian sects from the\r\nvery beginning of the Christian era. The time has now come to enquire\r\nwhat part Jewish influence played meanwhile in revolutions. Merely to\r\nask the question is to bring on oneself the accusation of\r\n\"anti-Semitism,\" yet the Jewish writer Bernard Lazare has shown the\r\nfalseness of this charge:\r\n\r\n     This [he writes] is what must separate the impartial historian from\r\n     anti-Semitism. The anti-Semite says: \"The Jew is the preparer, the\r\n     machinator, the chief engineer of revolutions\"; the impartial\r\n     historian confines himself to studying the part which the Jew,\r\n     considering his spirit, his character, the nature of his\r\n     philosophy, and his religion, may have taken in revolutionary\r\n     processes and movements.[455]\r\n\r\nLazare himself expresses the opinion, however, that--\r\n\r\n     The complaint of the anti-Semites seems to be founded: the Jew has\r\n     the revolutionary spirit; consciously or not he is an agent of\r\n     revolution. Yet the complaint complicates itself, for anti-Semitism\r\n     accuses the Jews of being the cause of revolutions. Let us examine\r\n     what this accusation is worth....[456]\r\n\r\nIn the light of our present knowledge it would certainly be absurd to\r\nascribe to the Jews the authorship of the conspiracy of Catiline or of\r\nthe Gracchi, the rising of Jack Straw and Wat Tyler, Jack Cade's\r\nrebellion, the _jacqueries_ of France, or the Peasants' Wars in Germany,\r\nalthough historical research may lead in time to the discovery of\r\ncertain occult influences--not necessarily Jewish--behind the European\r\ninsurrections here referred to. Moreover, apart from grievances or\r\nother causes of rebellion, the revolutionary spirit has always existed\r\nindependently of the Jews. In all times and in all countries there have\r\nbeen men born to make trouble as the sparks fly upward.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in modern revolutions the part played by the Jews cannot\r\nbe ignored, and the influence they have exercised will be seen on\r\nexamination to have been twofold--financial and occult. Throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages it is as sorcerers and usurers that they incur the\r\nreproaches of the Christian world, and it is still in the same role,\r\nunder the more modern terms of magicians and loan-mongers, that we\r\ndetect their presence behind the scenes of revolution from the\r\nseventeenth century onward. Wherever money was to be made out of social\r\nor political upheavals, wealthy Jews have been found to back the winning\r\nside; and wherever the Christian races have turned against their own\r\ninstitutions, Jewish Rabbis, philosophers, professors, and occultists\r\nhave lent them their support. It was not then necessarily that Jews\r\ncreated these movements, but they knew how to make use of them for their\r\nown ends.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that in the Great Rebellion we find them not amongst the\r\nIronsides of Cromwell or the members of his State Council, but\r\nfurnishing money and information to the insurgents, acting as army\r\ncontractors, loan-mongers, and super-spies--or to use the more\r\neuphonious term of Mr. Lucien Wolf, as \"political intelligencers\" of\r\nextraordinary efficiency. Thus Mr. Lucien Wolf, in referring to\r\nCarvajal, \"the great Jew of the Commonwealth,\" explains that \"the wide\r\nramifications of his commercial transactions and his relations with\r\nother Crypto-Jews all over the world placed him in an unrivalled\r\nposition to obtain news of the enemies of the Commonwealth.\"[457]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a \"secret service\" of this kind rendered the Jews a\r\nformidable hidden power, the more so since their very existence was\r\nfrequently unknown to the rest of the population around them. This\r\nprecaution was necessary because Jews were not supposed to exist at that\r\ndate in England. In 1290 Edward I had expelled them all, and for three\r\nand a half centuries they had remained in exile; the Crypto-Jews or\r\nMarranos who had come over from Spain contrived, however, to remain in\r\nthe country by skilfully taking the colour of their surroundings. Mr.\r\nWolf goes on to observe that Jewish services were regularly held in the\r\nsecret Synagogue, but \"in public Carvajal and his friends followed the\r\npractice of the secret Jews in Spain and Portugal, passing as Roman\r\nCatholics and regularly attending mass in the Spanish Ambassador's\r\nchapel.\"[458] But when war between England and Spain rendered this\r\nexpedient inadvisable, the Marranos threw off the disguise of\r\nChristianity and proclaimed themselves followers of the Jewish faith.\r\n\r\nNow, just at this period the Messianic era was generally believed by the\r\nJews to be approaching, and it appears to have occurred to them that\r\nCromwell might be fitted to the part. Consequently emissaries were\r\ndespatched to search the archives of Cambridge in order to discover\r\nwhether the Protector could possibly be of Jewish descent.[459] This\r\nquest proving fruitless, the Cabalist Rabbi of Amsterdam, Manasseh ben\r\nIsrael,[460] addressed a petition to Cromwell for the readmission of the\r\nJews to England, in which he adroitly insisted on the retribution that\r\novertakes those who afflict the people of Israel and the rewards that\r\nawait those who \"cherish\" them. These arguments were not without effect\r\non Cromwell, who entertained the same superstition, and although he is\r\nsaid to have declined the Jews' offer to buy St. Paul's Cathedral and\r\nthe Bodleian Library because he considered the £500,000 they offered\r\ninadequate,[461] he exerted every effort to obtain their readmission to\r\nthe country. In this he encountered violent opposition, and it seems\r\nthat Jews were not permitted to return in large numbers, or at any rate\r\nto enjoy full rights and privileges, until after the accession of\r\nCharles II, who in his turn had enlisted their financial aid.[462]\r\nLater, in 1688, the Jews of Amsterdam helped with their credit the\r\nexpedition of William of Orange against James II; the former in return\r\nbrought many Jews with him to England. So a Jewish writer is able to\r\nboast that \"a Monarch reigned who was indebted to Hebrew gold for his\r\nroyal diadem.\"[463]\r\n\r\nIn all this it is impossible to follow any consecutive political plan;\r\nthe rôle of the Jews seems to have been to support no cause consistently\r\nbut to obtain a footing in every camp, to back any venture that offered\r\na chance of profit. Yet mingled with these material designs were still\r\ntheir ancient Messianic dreams. It is curious to note that the same\r\nMessianic idea pervaded the Levellers, the rebels of the Commonwealth;\r\nsuch phrases as \"Let Israel go free,\" \"Israel's restoration is now\r\nbeginning,\" recur frequently in the literature of the sect. Gerard\r\nWinstanley, one of the two principal leaders, addressed an epistle to\r\n\"the Twelve Tribes of Israel that are circumcised in heart and scattered\r\nthrough all the Nations of the Earth,\" and promised them \"David their\r\nKing that they have been waiting for.\" The other leader of the movement,\r\nby name Everard, in fact declared, when summoned before the Lord Fairfax\r\nat Whitehall, that \"he was of the race of the Jews.\"[464] It is true\r\nthat the Levellers were by profession Christian, but after the manner of\r\nthe Bavarian Illuminati and of the Christian Socialists two centuries\r\nlater, claiming Christ as the author of their Communistic and\r\nequalitarian doctrines: \"For Jesus Christ, the Saviour of all Men, is\r\nthe greatest, first, and truest Leveller that ever was spoken of in the\r\nworld.\" The Levellers are said to have derived originally from the\r\nGerman Anabaptists; but Claudio Jannet, quoting German authorities,\r\nshows that there were Jews amongst the Anabaptists. \"They were carried\r\naway by their hatred of the name of Christian and imagined that their\r\ndreams of the restoration of the kingdom of Israel would be realized\r\namidst the conflagration.\"[465] Whether this was so or not, it is clear\r\nthat by the middle of the seventeenth century the mystical ideas of\r\nJudaism had penetrated into all parts of Europe. Was there then some\r\nCabalistic centre from which they radiated? Let us turn our eyes\r\neastward and we shall see.\r\n\r\nSince the sixteenth century the great mass of Jewry had settled in\r\nPoland, and a succession of miracle-workers known by the name of\r\nZaddikim or Ba'al Shems had arisen. The latter word, which signifies\r\n\"Master of the Name,\" originated with the German Polish Jews and was\r\nderived from the Cabalistic belief in the miraculous use of the sacred\r\nname of Jehovah, known as the Tetragrammaton.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cabalistic traditions, certain Jews of peculiar sanctity or\r\nknowledge were able with impunity to make use of the Divine Name. A\r\nBa'al Shem was therefore one who had acquired this power and employed it\r\nin writing amulets, invoking spirits, and prescribing cures for various\r\ndiseases. Poland and particularly Podolia--which had not yet been ceded\r\nto Russia--became thus a centre of Cabalism where a series of\r\nextraordinary movements of a mystical kind followed each other. In 1666,\r\nwhen the Messianic era was still believed to be approaching, the whole\r\nJewish world was convulsed by the sudden appearance of Shabbethai Zebi,\r\nthe son of a poulterer in Smyrna named Mordecai, who proclaimed himself\r\nthe promised Messiah and rallied to his support a huge following not\r\nonly amongst the Jews of Palestine, Egypt, and Eastern Europe, but even\r\nthe hard-headed Jews of the Continental bourses.[466] Samuel Pepys in\r\nhis Diary refers to the bets made amongst the Jews in London on the\r\nchances of \"a certain person now in Smyrna\" being acclaimed King of the\r\nWorld and the true Messiah.[467]\r\n\r\nShabbethai, who was an expert Cabalist and had the temerity to utter the\r\nIneffable Name Jehovah, was said to be possessed of marvellous powers,\r\nhis skin exuded exquisite perfume, he indulged perpetually in\r\nsea-bathing and lived in a state of chronic ecstasy. The pretensions of\r\nShabbethai, who took the title of \"King of the Kings of the Earth,\"\r\nsplit Jewry in two; many Rabbis launched imprecations against him, and\r\nthose who had believed in him were bitterly disillusioned when,\r\nchallenged by the Sultan to prove his claim to be the Messiah by\r\nallowing poisoned arrows to be shot at him, he suddenly renounced the\r\nJewish faith and proclaimed himself a Mohammedan. His conversion,\r\nhowever, appeared to be only partial, for \"at times he would assume the\r\nrôle of a pious Mohammedan and revile Judaism; at others he would enter\r\ninto relations with Jews as one of their own faith.\"[468] By this means\r\nhe retained the allegiance both of Moslems and of Jews. But the Rabbis,\r\nalarmed for the cause of Judaism, succeeded in obtaining his\r\nincarceration by the Sultan in a castle near Belgrade, where he died of\r\ncolic in 1676.[469]\r\n\r\nThis prosaic ending to the career of the Messiah did not, however,\r\naltogether extinguish the enthusiasm of his followers, and the\r\nShabbethan movement continued into the next century. In Poland Cabalism\r\nbroke out with renewed energy; fresh Zaddikim and Ba'al Shems arose, the\r\nmost noted of these being Israel of Podolia, known as Ba'al Shem Tob, or\r\nby the initial letters of this name, Besht, who founded his sect of\r\nHasidim in 1740.\r\n\r\nBesht, whilst opposing bigoted Rabbinism and claiming the Zohar as his\r\ninspiration, did not, however, adhere strictly to the doctrine of the\r\nCabala that the universe was an emanation of God, but evolved a form of\r\nPantheism, declaring that the whole universe was God, that even evil\r\nexists in God since evil is not bad in itself but only in its relation\r\nto Man; sin therefore has no positive existence.[470] As a result the\r\nfollowers of Besht, calling themselves the \"New Saints,\" and at his\r\ndeath numbering no less than 40,000, threw aside not only the precepts\r\nof the Talmud, but all the restraints of morality and even decency.[471]\r\n\r\nAnother Ba'al Shem of the same period was Heilprin, alias Joel Ben Uri\r\nof Satanov, who, like Israel of Podolia, professed to perform miracles\r\nby the use of the Divine Name and collected around him many pupils, who,\r\non the death of their master, \"formed a band of charlatans and\r\nshamelessly exploited the credulity of their contemporaries.\"[472]\r\n\r\nBut the most important of these Cabalistic groups was that of the\r\nFrankists, who were sometimes known as the Zoharists or the\r\nIlluminated,[473] from their adherence to the Zohar or book of Light, or\r\nin their birthplace Podolia as the Shabbethan Zebists, from their\r\nallegiance to the false Messiah of the preceding century--a heresy that\r\nhad been \"kept alive in secret circles which had something akin to a\r\nmasonic organization.\"[474] The founder of this sect was Jacob Frank, a\r\nbrandy distiller profoundly versed in the doctrines of the Cabala, who\r\nin 1755 collected around him a large following in Podolia and lived in a\r\nstyle of oriental magnificence, maintained by vast wealth of which no\r\none ever discovered the source. The persecution to which he was\r\nsubjected by the Rabbis led the Catholic clergy to champion his cause,\r\nwhereupon Frank threw himself on the mercy of the Bishop of Kaminick,\r\nand publicly burnt the Talmud, declaring that he recognized only the\r\nZohar, which, he alleged, admitted the doctrine of the Trinity. Thus the\r\nZoharists \"claimed that they regarded the Messiah-Deliverer as one of\r\nthe three divinities, but failed to state that by the Messiah they meant\r\nShabbethai Zebi.\"[475] The Bishop was apparently deceived by this\r\nmanoeuvre, and in 1759 the Zoharites declared themselves converted to\r\nChristianity, and were baptized, including Frank himself, who took the\r\nname of Joseph. \"The insincerity of the Frankists soon became apparent,\r\nhowever, for they continued to inter-marry only among themselves and\r\nheld Frank in reverence, calling him 'The Holy Master.'\"[476] It soon\r\nbecame evident that, whilst openly embracing the Catholic faith, they\r\nhad in reality retained their secret Judaism.[477] Moreover, it was\r\ndiscovered that Frank endeavoured to pass as a Mohammedan in Turkey; \"he\r\nwas therefore arrested in Warsaw and delivered to the Church tribunal on\r\nthe charge of feigned conversion to Christianity and the spreading of a\r\npernicious heresy.\"[478] Unlike his predecessor in apostasy, Shabbethai\r\nZebi, Frank, however, came to no untimely end, but after his release\r\nfrom prison continued to prey on the credulity of Christians and\r\nfrequently travelled to Vienna with his daughter, Eve, who succeeded in\r\nduping the pious Maria Theresa. But here also \"the sectarian plans of\r\nFrank were found out,\"[479] and he was obliged to leave Austria.\r\nFinally he settled at Offenbach and supported by liberal subsidies from\r\nthe other Jews, he resumed his former splendour[480]\r\n\r\n     with a retinue of several hundred beautiful Jewish youth of both\r\n     sexes; carts containing treasure were reported to be perpetually\r\n     brought in to him, chiefly from Poland--he went out daily in great\r\n     state to perform his devotions in the open field--he rode in a\r\n     chariot drawn by noble horses; ten or twelve Hulans in red or green\r\n     uniform, glittering with gold, by his side, with pikes in their\r\n     hands and crests on their caps, eagles, or stags, or the sun and\r\n     moon.... His followers believed him immortal, but in 1791 he died;\r\n     his burial was as splendid as his mode of living--800 persons\r\n     followed him to the grave.[481]\r\n\r\nNow, it is impossible to study the careers of these magicians in Poland\r\nand Germany without being reminded of their counterparts in France. The\r\nfamily likeness between the \"Baron von Offenbach,\" the \"Comte de\r\nSaint-Germain\" and the \"Comte de Cagliostro\" is at once apparent. All\r\nclaimed to perform miracles, all lived with extraordinary magnificence\r\non wealth derived from an unknown source, one was certainly a Jew, the\r\nother two were believed to be Jews, and all were known to be Cabalists.\r\nMoreover, all three spent many years in Germany, and it was whilst Frank\r\nwas living as Baron von Offenbach close to Frankfurt that Cagliostro was\r\nreceived into the Order of the Stricte Observance in a subterranean\r\nchamber a few miles from that city. Earlier in his career he was known\r\nto have visited Poland, whence Frank derived. Are we to believe that all\r\nthese men, so strangely alike in their careers, living at the same time\r\nand in the same places, were totally unconnected? It is a mere\r\ncoincidence that this group of Jewish Cabalist miracle-workers should\r\nhave existed in Germany and Poland at the precise moment that the\r\nCabalist magicians sprang up in France? Is it again a coincidence that\r\nMartines Pasqually founded his \"Kabbalistic sect\" of Illuminés in 1754\r\nand Jacob Frank his sect of Zoharites (or Illuminated) in 1755?\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we know from purely Jewish sources that the Ba'al Shem\r\nHeilprin had many pupils \"who formed a band of charlatans who\r\nshamelessly exploited the credulity of their contemporaries,\" that the\r\nBa'al Shem Tob and Jacob Frank both had large followings, it is surely\r\nhere that we may find the origin of those mysterious magicians who\r\nspread themselves over Europe at this date.\r\n\r\nIt will at once be asked: \"But what proof is there that any one of these\r\nBa'al Shems or Cabalists was connected with masonic or secret\r\nsocieties?\" The answer is that the most important Ba'al Shem of the day,\r\nknown as \"the Chief of all the Jews,\" is shown by documentary evidence\r\nto have been an initiate of Freemasonry and in direct contact with the\r\nleaders of the secret societies. If then it is agreed that neither\r\nSaint-Germain nor Cagliostro can be proved to have been Jews, here we\r\nhave a man concerned in the movement, more important than either, whose\r\nnationality admits of no doubt whatever.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary personage, known as the \"Ba'al Shem of London,\" was a\r\nCabalistic Jew named Hayyim Samuel Jacob Falk, also called Dr. Falk,\r\nFalc, de Falk, or Falkon, born in 1708, probably in Podolia. The further\r\nfact that he was regarded by his fellow-Jews as an adherent of the\r\nMessiah Shabbethai Zebi clearly shows his connexion with the Podolian\r\nZoharites. Falk was thus not an isolated phenomenon, but a member of one\r\nof the groups described in the foregoing pages. The following is a\r\nsummary of the account given of the Ba'al Shem of London in the _Jewish\r\nEncyclopedia_:\r\n\r\n     Falk claimed to possess thaumaturgic powers and to be able to\r\n     discover hidden treasure. Archenholz (_England und Italien_, I.\r\n     249) recounts certain marvels which he had seen performed by Falk\r\n     in Brunswick and which he attributes to a special knowledge of\r\n     chemistry. In Westphalia at one time Falk was sentenced to be\r\n     burned as a sorcerer, but escaped to England. Here he was received\r\n     with hospitality and rapidly gained fame as a Cabalist and worker\r\n     of miracles. Many stories of his powers were current. He would\r\n     cause a small taper to remain alight for weeks; an incantation\r\n     would fill his cellar with coal; plate left with a pawnbroker would\r\n     glide back into his house. When a fire threatened to destroy the\r\n     Great Synagogue, he averted the disaster by writing four Hebrew\r\n     letters on the pillars of the door.[482] [Obviously the\r\n     Tetragrammaton.]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in London in 1742 Falk appeared to be without means, but\r\nsoon after he was seen to be in possession of considerable wealth,\r\nliving in a comfortable house in Wellclose Square, where he had his\r\nprivate synagogue, whilst gold and silver plate adorned his table. His\r\nJournal, still preserved in the library of the United Synagogue,\r\ncontains references to \"mysterious journeyings\" to and from Epping\r\nForest, to meetings, a meeting-chamber in the forest, and chests of gold\r\nthere buried. It was said that on one occasion when he was driving\r\nthither along Whitechapel Road, a back wheel of his carriage came off,\r\nwhich alarmed the coachman, but Falk ordered him to drive on and the\r\nwheel followed the carriage all the way to the forest.\r\n\r\nThe stories of Falk's miraculous powers are too numerous to relate here,\r\nbut a letter written by an enthusiastic Jewish admirer, Sussman\r\nShesnowzi, to his son in Poland will serve to show the reputation he\r\nenjoyed:\r\n\r\n     Hear, my beloved son, of the marvellous gifts entrusted to a son of\r\n     man, who verily is not a man, a light of the captivity ... a holy\r\n     light, a saintly man ... who dwells at present in the great city of\r\n     London. Albeit I could not fully understand him on account of his\r\n     volubility and his speaking as an inhabitant of Jerusalem.... His\r\n     chamber is lighted by silver candlesticks on the walls, with a\r\n     central eight-branched lamp made of pure silver of beaten work. And\r\n     albeit it contained oil to burn a day and a night it remained\r\n     enkindled for three weeks. On one occasion he abode in seclusion in\r\n     his house for six weeks without meat and drink. When at the\r\n     conclusion of this period ten persons were summoned to enter, they\r\n     found him seated on a sort of throne, his head covered with a\r\n     golden turban, a golden chain round his neck with a pendant silver\r\n     star on which sacred names were inscribed. Verily this man stands\r\n     alone in his generation by reason of his knowledge of holy\r\n     mysteries. I cannot recount to you all the wonders he accomplishes.\r\n     I am grateful, in that I am found worthy to be received among those\r\n     who dwell within the shadow of his wisdom.... I know that many will\r\n     believe my words, but others, who do not occupy themselves with\r\n     mysteries, will laugh thereat. Therefore, my son, be very\r\n     circumspect, and show this only to wise and discreet men. For here\r\n     in London this master has not been disclosed to anyone who does not\r\n     belong to our Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe esteem in which Falk was held by the Jewish community, including the\r\nChief Rabbi and the Rabbi of the new Synagogue, appears to have roused\r\nthe resentment of his co-religionist Emden, who denounced him as a\r\nfollower of the false Messiah and an exploiter of Christian credulity.\r\n\r\n     Falk [he wrote in a letter to Poland] had made his position by his\r\n     pretence to be an adept in practical Cabala, by which means he\r\n     professed to be able to discover hidden treasures; by his\r\n     pretensions he had entrapped a wealthy captain whose fortune he had\r\n     cheated him out of, so that he was reduced to depending on the\r\n     Rabbi's charity, and yet, despite this, wealthy Christians spend\r\n     their money on him, whilst Falk spends his bounty on the men of his\r\n     Brotherhood so that they may spread his fame.\r\n\r\nIn general Falk appears to have displayed extreme caution in his\r\nrelations with Christian seekers after occult knowledge, for the _Jewish\r\nEncyclopædia_ goes on to say: \"Archenholz mentions a royal prince who\r\napplied to Falk in his quest for the philosopher's stone, but was denied\r\nadmittance.\" Nevertheless Hayyum Azulai mentions (Ma'gal Tob, p. 13_b_):\r\n\r\n     That when in Paris in 1778 he was told by the Marchesa de Crona\r\n     that the Ba'al Shem of London had taught her the Cabala. Falk seems\r\n     also to have been on intimate terms with that strange adventurer\r\n     Baron Theodor de Neuhoff.... Falk's principal friends were the\r\n     London bankers Aaron Goldsmid and his son.[483] Pawnbroking and\r\n     successful speculation enabled him to acquire a considerable\r\n     fortune. He left large sums of money to charity, and the overseers\r\n     of the United Synagogue in London still distribute annually certain\r\n     payments left by him for the poor.\r\n\r\nNothing of all this would lead one to suppose that Falk could be\r\nregarded in the light of a black magician; it is therefore surprising to\r\nfind Dr. Adler observing that a horrible account of a Jewish Cabalist in\r\n_The Gentleman's Magazine_ for September 1762 \"obviously refers to Dr.\r\nFalk, though his name is not mentioned.\"[484] This man is described as\r\n\"a christened Jew and the biggest rogue and villain in all the world,\"\r\nwho \"had been imprisoned everywhere and banished out of all countries in\r\nGermany, and also sometimes publicly whipped, so that his back lost all\r\nthe old skin, and became new again, and yet left never off from his\r\nvillainies, but grew always worse.\" The writer goes on to relate that\r\nthe Cabalist offered to teach him certain mysteries, but explained that\r\nbefore entering on any \"experiments of the said godly mysteries, we\r\nmust first avoid all churches and places of worshipping as unclean\"; he\r\nthen bound his initiate by a very strong oath and proceeded to tell him\r\nthat he must steal a Hebrew Bible from a Protestant and also procure\r\n\"one pound of blood out of the veins of an honest Protestant.\" The\r\ninitiate thereupon robbed a Protestant of all his effects, but had\r\nhimself bled of about three-quarters of a pound of blood, which he gave\r\nto the magician. He thus describes the ceremony that took place:\r\n\r\n     Then the next night about 11 o'clock, we both went into the garden\r\n     of my own, and the cabalist put a cross, tainted with my blood, in\r\n     each corner of the garden, and in the middle of the garden a\r\n     threefold circle ... in the first circle were written all the names\r\n     of God in Hebrew; in the second all the names of the angels; and in\r\n     the third the first chapter of the holy Gospel of St. John, and it\r\n     was all written with my blood.\r\n\r\nThe cruelties then performed by the Cabalist on a he-goat are too\r\nloathsome to transcribe. The whole story, indeed, appears a farrago of\r\nnonsense and would not be worth quoting but for the fact that it appears\r\nto be taken seriously by Dr. Adler as a description of the great Ba'al\r\nShem.\r\n\r\nThe death of Falk took place on April 17, 1782, and the epitaph on his\r\ngrave in the cemetery at Globe Road, Mile End, \"bears witness to his\r\nexcellencies and orthodoxy\": \"Here is interred ... the aged and\r\nhonourable man, a great personage who came from the East, an\r\naccomplished sage, an adept in Cabbalah.... His name was known to the\r\nends of the earth and distant isles,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThis then is surely the portrait of a most remarkable personage, a man\r\nknown for his powers in England, France, and Germany, visited by a royal\r\nprince in search of the philosopher's stone, and acclaimed by one of his\r\nown race as standing alone in his generation by reason of his knowledge,\r\nyet whilst Saint-Germain and Cagliostro figure in every account of\r\neighteenth-century magicians, it is only in exclusively Judaic or\r\nmasonic works, not intended for the general public, that we shall find\r\nany reference to Falk. Have we not here striking evidence of the truth\r\nof M. André Baron's dictum: \"Remember that the constant rule of the\r\nsecret societies is that the real authors never show themselves\"?\r\n\r\nIt will now be asked: what proof is there that Falk is connected with\r\nany masonic or secret societies? True, in the accounts given by the\r\n_Jewish Encyclopædia_, the word Freemasonry is not once mentioned. But\r\nin the curious portrait of the great Ba'al Shem appended, we see him\r\nholding in his hand the pair of compasses, and before him, on the table\r\nat which he is seated, the double triangle or Seal of Solomon known\r\namongst Jews as \"the Shield of David,\" which forms an important emblem\r\nin Masonry.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is significant to find in the _Royal Masonic Encyclopædia_\r\nby the Rosicrucian Kenneth Mackenzie that a long and detailed article is\r\ndevoted to Falk, though again without any reference to his connexion\r\nwith Freemasonry. May we not conclude that in certain inner masonic\r\ncircles the importance of Falk is recognized but must not be revealed to\r\nthe uninitiated? Mr. Gordon Hills, in the above-quoted paper contributed\r\nto the _Ars Quatuor Coronatorum_, indulges in some innocent speculation\r\nas to the part Falk may have played in the masonic movement. \"If,\" he\r\nobserves, \"Jewish Brethren did introduce Cabalistical learning into the\r\nso-called High Degrees, here we have one, who, if a Mason, would have\r\nbeen eminently qualified to do so.\"\r\n\r\nFalk inded was far more than a Mason, he was a high initiate--the\r\nsupreme oracle to which the secret societies applied for guidance. All\r\nthis was disclosed a few years ago in the correspondence between\r\nSavalette de Langes and the Marquis de Chefdebien referred to in the\r\nprevious chapter. Thus in the _dossiers_ of the leading occultists\r\nsupplied by Savalette we find the following note on the Ba'al Shem of\r\nLondon:\r\n\r\n     This Doctor Falk is known to many Germans. He is a very\r\n     extraordinary man from every point of view. Some people believe him\r\n     to be the Chief of all the Jews and attribute to purely political\r\n     schemes all that is marvellous and singular in his life and\r\n     conduct. He is referred to in a very curious manner, and as a\r\n     Rose-Croix in the _Memoirs of the Chevalier de Rampsow_ (i.e.\r\n     Rentzov). He has had adventures with the Maréchal de Richelieu,\r\n     great seeker of the Philosophers' Stone. He had a strange history\r\n     with the Prince de Rohan Guéménée and the Chevalier de Luxembourg\r\n     relating to Louis XV, whose death he foretold. He is almost\r\n     inaccessible. In all the sects of savants in secret sciences he\r\n     passes as a superior man. He is at present in England. The Baron de\r\n     Gleichen can give good information about him. Try to get more at\r\n     Frankfurt.[485]\r\n\r\nAgain, in notes on other personages the name of Falk recurs with the\r\nsame insistence on his importance as a high initiate:\r\n\r\n     Leman, pupil of Falk....\r\n\r\n     The Baron de Gleichen ... intimately connected with Wecter\r\n     [Waechter] and Wakenfeldt.... He knows Falk....\r\n\r\n     The Baron de Waldenfels ... is, according to what I know from the\r\n     Baron de Gleichen, the princes of Daimstadt, ... and others, the\r\n     most interesting man for you and me to know. If we made his\r\n     acquaintance, he could give us the best information on all the most\r\n     interesting objects of instiuction. He knows Falk and Wecter.\r\n\r\nPrince Louis d'Haimstadt ... is also a member of the Amis Réunis, 12°\r\nand in charge of the Directories. He worked in his youth with a Jew whom\r\nhe believes to be taught by Falk....[486]\r\n\r\nHere, then, behind the organization of the Stricte Observance, of the\r\nAmis Réunis, and the Philalèthes, we catch a glimpse at last of one of\r\nthose _real initiates_ whose identity has been so carefully kept dark.\r\nFor Falk, as we see in these notes, was not an isolated sage; he had\r\npupils, and to be one of these was to be admitted to the inner\r\nmysteries. Was Cagliostro one of these adepts? Is it here we may seek\r\nthe explanation of the \"Egyptian Rite\" devised by him in London, and of\r\nhis chance discovery on a bookstall in that city of a Cabalistic\r\ndocument by the mysterious \"George Cofton,\" whose identity has never\r\nbeen revealed? I would suggest that the whole story of the bookstall was\r\na fable and that it was not from any manuscript, but from Falk, that\r\nCagliostro received his directions. Thus Cagliostro's rite was in\r\nreality concealed Cabalism.\r\n\r\nThat Falk was only one of several Concealed Superiors is further\r\nsuggested by the intriguing correspondence of Savalette de Langes.\r\n\"Schroeder,\" we read, \"had for his master an old man of Suabia,\" by whom\r\nthe Baron de Waechter was also said to have been instructed in Masonry,\r\nand to have become one of the most important initiates of Germany.\r\nAccordingly de Waechter was despatched by his Order to Florence in order\r\nto make enquiries on further secrets and on certain famous treasures\r\nabout which Schroepfer, the Baron de Hundt, and others, had heard that\r\nAprosi, the secretary of the Pretender, could give them information.\r\nWaechter, however, wrote to say that all they had been told on the\r\nlatter point was fabulous, but that he had met in Florence certain\r\n\"Brothers of the Holy Land,\" who had initiated him into marvellous\r\nsecrets; one in particular who is described as \"a man who is not a\r\nEuropean\" had \"perfectly instructed him.\" Moreover, de Waechter, who had\r\nset forth poor, returned loaded with riches attributed by his\r\nfellow-masons to the \"Asiatic Brethren\" he had frequented in Florence\r\nwho possessed the art of making gold.[487] I would suggest then that\r\nthese were the members of the \"Italian Order\" referred to by Mr.\r\nTuckett, which, like Schroepfer and de Hundt, he imagined to have been\r\nconnected with the Jacobites.\r\n\r\nBut all these secret sources of instruction are wrapped in mystery.\r\nWhilst Saint-Germain and Cagliostro--who is referred to in this\r\ncorrespondence in terms of light derision--emerge into the limelight,\r\nthe real initiates remain concealed in the background. Falk \"is almost\r\ninaccessible!\" Yet one more almost forgotten document of the period may\r\nthrow some light on the important part he played behind the scenes in\r\nMasonry.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that Archenholz had spoken of certain marvels he\r\nhad seen performed by Falk in Brunswick. Now, in 1770 the German poet\r\nGotthold Ephraim Lessing was made librarian to the Duke of Brunswick in\r\nthat city. The fame of Falk may then have reached his ears. At any rate\r\nin 1771 Lessing, after having mocked at Freemasonry, was initiated in a\r\nmasonic lodge at Hamburg, and in 1778 he published not only his famous\r\nmasonic drama _Nathan der Weise_, in which the Jew of Jerusalem is shown\r\nin admirable contrast to the Christians and Mohammedans, but he also\r\nwrote five dialogues on Freemasonry which he dedicated to the Duke of\r\nBrunswick, Grand Master of all the German Lodges, and which he entitled\r\n\"_Ernst und Falk: Gespräche fur Freimaurer_.\"[488]\r\n\r\nLessing's friendship with Moses Mendelssohn has led to the popular\r\ntheory, unsupported however by any real evidence, that the Jewish\r\nphilosopher of Berlin provided the inspiration for the character of\r\nNathan, but might it not equally have been provided by the\r\nmiracle-worker of Brunswick? However, in the case of the dialogues less\r\nroom is left for doubt. Falk is mentioned by name and represented as\r\ninitiated into the highest mysteries of Freemasonry. This is of course\r\nnot explained by Lessing's commentators, who give no clue to his\r\nidentity.[489] It is evident that Lessing committed an enormous blunder\r\nin thus letting so important a cat out of the bag, for after the\r\npublication of the first three dialogues and whilst the last two were\r\ncirculating privately in manuscript amongst the Freemasons, an order\r\nfrom the Duke of Brunswick forbade their publication as dangerous. In\r\nspite of this prohibition, the rest of the series was printed, however\r\nwithout Lessing's permission, in 1870 with a preface by an unknown\r\nperson describing himself as a non-mason.\r\n\r\nThe dialogues between Ernst and Falk throw a curious light on the\r\ninfluences at work behind Freemasonry at this period and gain immensely\r\nin interest when the identity of the two men in question is understood.\r\nThus Ernst, by whom Lessing evidently represents himself, is at the\r\nbeginning not a Freemason, and, whilst sitting with Falk in a wood,\r\nquestions the high initiate on the aims of the Order. Falk explains that\r\nFreemasonry has always existed, but not under this name. Its real\r\npurpose has never been revealed. On the surface it appears to be a\r\npurely philanthropic association, but in reality philanthropy forms no\r\npart of its scheme, its object being to bring about a state of things\r\nwhich will render philanthropy unnecessary. (_Was man gemeinlich gute\r\nThaten zu nennen pflegt entbehrlich zu machen_.) As an illustration Falk\r\npoints to an ant-heap at the foot of the tree beneath which the two men\r\nare seated. \"Why,\" he asks, \"should not human beings exist without\r\ngovernment like the ants or bees?\" Falk then goes on to describe his\r\nidea of a Universal State, or rather a federation of States, in which\r\nmen will no longer be divided by national, social, or religious\r\nprejudices, and where greater equality will exist.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third dialogue an interval occurs during which Ernst\r\ngoes away and becomes a Freemason, but on his return expresses his\r\ndisappointment to Falk at finding many Freemasons engaged in such\r\nfutilities as alchemy or the evocation of spirits. Others again seek to\r\nrevive the * * *. Falk replies that although the great secrets of\r\nFreemasonry cannot be revealed by any man even if he wished it, one\r\nthing, however, has been kept dark which should now be made public, and\r\nthis is the relationship between the Freemasons and the * * *.  \"The\r\n* * * were in fact the Freemasons of their time.\" It seems probable from\r\nthe context and from Falk's references to Sir Christopher Wren as the\r\nfounder of the modern Order, that the asterisks denote the Rosicrucians.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point of these dialogues is, however, the hint\r\ncontinually thrown out by Falk that there is something behind\r\nFreemasonry, something far older and far wider in its aims than the\r\nOrder now known by this name--the modern Freemasons are for the most\r\npart only \"playing at it.\" Thus, when Ernst complains that true\r\nequality has not been attained in the lodges since Jews are not\r\nadmitted, Falk observes that he himself does not attend them, that true\r\nFreemasonry does not exist in outward forms--\"A lodge bears the same\r\nrelation to Freemasonry as a church to belief.\" In other words, the real\r\ninitiates do not appear upon the scene. Here then we see the role of the\r\n\"Concealed Superiors.\" What wonder that Lessing's dialogues were\r\nconsidered too dangerous for publication!\r\n\r\nMoreover, in Falk's conception of the ideal social order and his\r\nindictment of what he calls \"bourgeois society\" we find the clue to\r\nmovements of immense importance. Has not the system of the ant-heap or\r\nthe beehive proved, as I have pointed out elsewhere, the model on which\r\nmodern Anarchists, from Proudhon onwards, have formed their schemes for\r\nthe reorganization of human life? Has not the idea of the \"World\r\nState,\" \"The Universal Republic\" become the war-cry of the\r\nInternationalist Socialists, the Grand Orient Masons, the Theosophists,\r\nand the world-revolutionaries of our own day?\r\n\r\nWas Falk, then, a revolutionary? This again will be disputed. Falk may\r\nhave been a Cabalist, a Freemason, a high initiate, but what proof is\r\nthere that he had any connexion with the leaders of the French\r\nRevolution? Let us turn again to the _Jewish Encyclopædia_:\r\n\r\n     Falk ... is ... believed to have given the Duc d'Orléans, to ensure\r\n     his succession to the throne, a talisman consisting of a ring,\r\n     which Philippe Egalité before mounting the scaffold is said to have\r\n     sent to a Jewess, Juliet Goudchaux, who passed it on to his son,\r\n     subsequently Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nThe Baron de Gleichen, who \"knew Falc,\" refers to a talisman of\r\nlapis-lazuli which the Due d'Orleans had received in England from \"the\r\ncelebrated Falk Scheck, first Rabbi of the Jews,\" and says that a\r\ncertain occultist, Madame de la Croix, imagined she had destroyed it by\r\n\"the power of prayer.\" But the theory of its survival is further\r\nconfirmed by the information supplied from Jewish sources to Mr. Gordon\r\nHills, who states that Falk was \"in touch with the French Court in the\r\nperson of 'Prince Emanuel,'[490] whom he describes as a servant of the\r\nKing of France,\" and adds that the talismanic ring which he gave to the\r\nDue d'Orleans \"is still in the possession of the family, having passed\r\nto King Louis Philippe and thence to the Comte de Paris.\"[491]\r\n\r\nOne fact, then, looms out of the darkness that envelops the secret power\r\nbehind the Orléanist conspiracy, one fact of supreme importance, and\r\nbased moreover on purely Jewish evidence: the Duke was in touch with\r\nFalk when in London and Falk supported his scheme of usurpation. Thus\r\nbehind the arch-conspirator of the revolution stood \"the Chief of all\r\nthe Jews.\" Is it here perhaps, in Falk's \"chests of gold,\" that we might\r\nfind the source of some of those loans raised in London by the Due\r\nd'Orléans to finance the riots of the Revolution, so absurdly described\r\nas \"l'or de Pitt\"?\r\n\r\nThe direct connexion between the attack on the French monarchy and\r\nJewish circles in London is further shown by the curious sequel to the\r\nGordon Riots. In 1780 the half-witted Lord George Gordon (as a Jewish\r\nwriter describes him), the head of the so-called \"Protestant\" mob,\r\nmarched on the House of Commons to protest against the bill for the\r\nrelief of Roman Catholic disabilities and then proceeded to carry out\r\nhis plan of burning down London. During the five days' rioting that\r\nensued, property to the amount of £180,000 was destroyed. After this\r\n\"the scion of the ducal house of Gordon proved the durability of his\r\nlove for Protestantism by professing the Hebrew faith,\" and was received\r\nwith the highest honours into the Synagogue. The same Jewish writer, who\r\nhas described him earlier as half-witted, quotes this panegyric on his\r\northodoxy: \"He was very regular in his Jewish observances; every morning\r\nhe was seen with the philacteries between his eyes, and opposite his\r\nheart.... His Saturday's bread was baked according to the manner of the\r\nJews, his wine was Jewish, his meat was Jewish, and he was the best Jew\r\nin the congregation of Israel.\" And it was immediately after his\r\nconversion to Judaism that he published in _The Public Advertiser_ the\r\nlibel against Marie Antoinette which brought about his imprisonment in\r\nNewgate.[492]\r\n\r\nNow we know that Lord George Gordon met Cagliostro in London in\r\n1786.[493] Is it not probable that the author of the scurrilous pamphlet\r\nand the magician concerned in the attack on the Queen's honour through\r\nthe Affair of the Necklace--one a--Jew by profession, the other said to\r\nbe a Jew by race--may have had some connexion with Philippe Egalité's\r\nJewish supporter, the miracle worker of Wellclose Square?\r\n\r\nBut already a vaster genius than Falk or Cagliostro, than Pasqually or\r\nSavalette de Langes, had arisen, who, gathering into his hands the\r\nthreads of all the conspiracies, was able to weave them together into a\r\ngigantic scheme for the destruction of France and of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian Illuminati\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the system to which I shall henceforth refer simply as\r\nIlluminism is of such immense importance to an understanding of the\r\nmodern revolutionary movement that, although I have already described it\r\nin detail in _World Revolution_, it is necessary to devote a further\r\nchapter to it here in order to answer the objections made against my\r\nformer account of the Order and also to show its connexion with earlier\r\nsecret societies.\r\n\r\nNow, the main contentions of those writers who, either consciously or\r\nunconsciously, attempt to mislead the public on the true nature and real\r\nexistence of Illuminism are:\r\n\r\nFirstly, that the case against Illuminism rests solely on the works of\r\nRobison, and of Barruel and later Catholic authorities.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that all these writers misinterpreted or misquoted the\r\nIlluminati, who should be judged only by their own works.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that in reality the Illuminati were perfectly innocuous and\r\neven praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that they are of no importance, since they ceased to exist in\r\n1786.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter I propose therefore to answer all these\r\ncontentions in turn and at the same time to make further examination\r\ninto the origins of the Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigins of the Illuminati\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Weishaupt was not the originator of the system he named Illuminism\r\nwill be already apparent to every reader of the present work; it has\r\nneeded, in fact, all the foregoing chapters to trace the source of\r\nWeishaupt's doctrines throughout the history of the world. From these it\r\nwill be evident that men aiming at the overthrow of the existing social\r\norder and of all accepted religion had existed from the earliest times,\r\nand that in the Cainites, the Carpocratians, the Manichæns, the\r\nBatinis, the Fatimites, and the Karmathites many of Weishaupt's ideas\r\nhad already been foreshadowed. To the Manichæans, in fact, the word\r\n\"Illuminati\" may be traced--\"gloriantur Manichæi se de caelo\r\nilluminatos.\"[494]\r\n\r\nIt is in the sect of Abdullah ibn Maymūn that we must seek the model\r\nfor Weishaupt's system of organization. Thus de Sacy has described in\r\nthe following words the manner of enlisting proselytes by the Ismailis:\r\n\r\n     They proceeded to the admission and initiation of new proselytes\r\n     only by degrees and with great reserve; for, as the sect had at the\r\n     same time a political object and ambitions, its interest was above\r\n     all to have a great number of partisans in all places and in all\r\n     classes of society. It was necessary therefore to suit themselves\r\n     to the character, the temperament, and the prejudices of the\r\n     greater number; what one revealed to some would have revolted\r\n     others and alienated for ever spirits less bold and consciences\r\n     more easily alarmed.[495]\r\n\r\nThis passage exactly describes the methods laid down by Weishaupt for\r\nhis \"Insinuating Brothers\"--the necessity of proceeding with caution in\r\nthe enlisting of adepts, of not revealing to the novice doctrines that\r\nmight be likely to revolt him, of \"speaking sometimes in one way,\r\nsometimes in another, so that one's real purpose should remain\r\nimpenetrable\" to members of the inferior grades.\r\n\r\nHow did these Oriental methods penetrate to the Bavarian professor?\r\nAccording to certain writers, through the Jesuits. The fact that\r\nWeishaupt had been brought up by this Order has provided the enemies of\r\nthe Jesuits with the argument that they were the secret inspirers of the\r\nIlluminati. Mr. Gould, indeed, has attributed most of the errors of the\r\nlatter to this source; Weishaupt, he writes, incurred \"the implacable\r\nenmity of the Jesuits, to whose intrigues he was incessantly exposed.\"[496]\r\nIn reality precisely the opposite was the case, for, as we shall\r\nsee, it was Weishaupt who perpetually intrigued against the Jesuits.\r\nThat Weishaupt did, however, draw to a certain extent on Jesuit methods\r\nof training is recognized even by Barruel, himself a Jesuit, who,\r\nquoting Mirabeau, says that Weishaupt \"admired above all those laws,\r\nthat _régime_ of the Jesuits, which, under one head, made men dispersed\r\nover the universe tend towards the same goal; he felt that one could\r\nimitate their methods whilst holding views diametrically opposed.\"[497]\r\nAnd again, on the evidence of Mirabeau, de Luchet, and von Knigge,\r\nBarruel says elsewhere: \"It is here that Weishaupt appears specially to\r\nhave wished to assimilate the régime of the sect to that of the\r\nreligious orders and, above all, that of the Jesuits, by the total\r\nabandonment of their own will and judgement which he demands of his\r\nadepts ...\" But Barruel goes on to show \"the enormous difference that is\r\nto be found between religious obedience and Illuminist obedience.\" In\r\nevery religious order men know that the voice of their conscience and of\r\ntheir God is even more to be obeyed than that of their superiors.\r\n\r\n     There is not a single one who, in the event that his superiors\r\n     should order him to do things contrary to the duties of a Christian\r\n     or of a good man, would not see an exception to be made to the\r\n     obedience which he has sworn. This exception is often expressed and\r\n     always clearly announced in all religious institutions; it is above\r\n     all formal and positively repeated many times in that of the\r\n     Jesuits. They are ordered to obey their superiors, but it is in the\r\n     event that they see no sin in obeying, _ubi non cerneretur peccatum\r\n     (Constitution des Jesuites_, part 3, chapter I, parag. 2, vol. i.,\r\n     édition de Prague).[498]\r\n\r\nIndeed, implicit obedience and the total surrender of one's own will and\r\njudgement forms the foundation of all military discipline; \"theirs not\r\nto reason why, theirs not to make reply\" is everywhere recognized as the\r\nduty of soldiers. The Jesuits being in a sense a military Order,\r\nacknowledging a General at their head, are bound by the same obligation.\r\nWeishaupt's system was something totally different. For whilst all\r\nsoldiers and all Jesuits, when obeying their superiors, are well aware\r\nof the goal towards which they are tending, Weishaupt's followers were\r\nenlisted by the most subtle methods of deception and led on towards a\r\ngoal entirely unknown to them. It is this that, as we shall see later,\r\nconstitutes the whole difference between honest and dishonest secret\r\nsocieties. The fact is that the accusation of Jesuit intrigue behind\r\nsecret societies has emanated principally from the secret societies\r\nthemselves and would appear to have been a device adopted by them to\r\ncover their own tracks. No good evidence has ever been brought forward\r\nin support of their contention. The Jesuits, unlike the Templars and\r\nthe Illuminati, were simply suppressed in 1773 without the formality of\r\na trial, and were therefore never given the opportunity to answer the\r\ncharges brought against them, nor, as in the case of these other Orders,\r\nwere their secret statutes--if any such existed--brought to light. The\r\nonly document ever produced in proof of these accusations was the\r\n\"Monita Secreta,\" long since shown to be a forgery. At any rate, the\r\ncorrespondence of the Illuminati provides their best exoneration. The\r\nMarquis de Luchet, who was no friend of the Jesuits, shows the absurdity\r\nof confounding their aims with those of either the Freemasons or the\r\nIlluminati, and describes all three as animated by wholly different\r\npurposes.[499]\r\n\r\nIn all these questions it is necessary to seek a motive. I have no\r\npersonal interest in defending the Jesuits, but I ask: what motive could\r\nthe Jesuits have in forming or supporting a conspiracy directed against\r\nall thrones and altars? It has been answered me that the Jesuits at this\r\nperiod cared nothing for thrones and altars, but only for temporal\r\npower; yet--even accepting this unwarrantable hypothesis--how was this\r\npower to be exercised except through thrones and altars? Was it not\r\nthrough princes and the Church that the Jesuits had been able to bring\r\ntheir influence to bear on affairs of state? In an irreligious Republic,\r\nas events afterwards proved, the power of the whole clergy was bound to\r\nbe destroyed. The truth is then, that, far from abetting the Illuminati,\r\nthe Jesuits were their most formidable opponents, the only body of men\r\nsufficiently learned, astute, and well organized to outwit the schemes\r\nof Weishaupt. In suppressing the Jesuits it is possible that the Old\r\nRégime removed the only barrier capable of resisting the tide of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nWeishaupt indeed, as we know, detested the Jesuits,[500] and took from\r\nthem only certain methods of discipline, of ensuring obedience or of\r\nacquiring influence over the minds of his disciples; his aims were\r\nentirely different.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, did Weishaupt find his immediate inspiration? It is here\r\nthat Barruel and Lecouteulx de Canteleu provide a clue not to be\r\ndiscovered in other sources. In 1771, they relate, a certain Jutland\r\nmerchant named Kölmer, who had spent many years in Egypt, returned to\r\nEurope in search of converts to a secret doctrine founded on Manichæism\r\nthat he had learnt in the East. On his way to France he stopped at\r\nMalta, where he met Cagliostro and nearly brought about an insurrection\r\namongst the people. Kölmer was therefore driven out of the island by the\r\nKnights of Malta and betook himself to Avignon and Lyons. Here he made a\r\nfew disciples amongst the Illuminés and in the same year went on to\r\nGermany, where he encountered Weishaupt and initiated him into all the\r\nmysteries of his secret doctrine. According to Barruel, Weishaupt then\r\nspent five years thinking out his system, which he founded under the\r\nname of Illuminati on May 1, 1776, and assumed the \"illuminated\" name of\r\n\"Spartacus.\"\r\n\r\nKölmer remains the most mysterious of all the mystery men of his day; at\r\nfirst sight one is inclined to wonder whether he may not have been\r\nanother of the Cabalistic Jews acting as the secret inspirers of the\r\nmagicians who appeared in the limelight. The name Kölmer might easily\r\nhave been a corruption of the well-known Jewish name Calmer. Lecouteulx\r\nde Canteleu, however, suggests that Kölmer was identical with Altolas,\r\ndescribed by Figuier as \"this universal genius, almost divine, of whom\r\nCagliostro has spoken to us with so much respect and admiration. This\r\nAltotas was not an imaginary personage. The Inquisition of Rome has\r\ncollected many proofs of his existence without having been able to\r\ndiscover when it began or ended, for Altotas disappears, or rather\r\nvanishes like a meteor, which, according to the poetic fancy of\r\nromancers, would authorize us in declaring him immortal.\"[501] It is\r\ncurious to notice that modern occultists, whilst attributing so much\r\nimportance to Saint-Germain and the legend of his immortality, make no\r\nmention of Altotas, who appears to have been a great deal more\r\nremarkable. But, again, we must remember: \"It is the unvarying rule of\r\nsecret societies that the real authors never show themselves.\" If, then,\r\nKölmer was the same person as Altotas, he would appear not to have been\r\na Jew or a Cabalist, but an initiate of some Near Eastern secret\r\nsociety--possibly an Ismaili. Lecouteulx de Canteleu describes Altotas\r\nas an Armenian, and says that his system was derived from those of\r\nEgypt, Syria, and Persia. This would accord with Barruel's statement\r\nthat Kölmer came from Egypt, and that his ideas were founded on\r\nManichæism.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary to set these statements aside as only the\r\ntheories of Barruel or Lecouteulx, were it not that the writings of the\r\nIlluminati betray the influence of some sect akin to Manichæism. Thus\r\n\"Spartacus\" writes to \"Cato\" that he is thinking of \"warming up the old\r\nsystem of the Ghebers and Parsees,\"[502] and it will be remembered that\r\nthe Ghebers were one of the sects in which Dozy relates that Abdullah\r\nibn Maymūn found his true supporters. Later Weishaupt goes on to\r\nexplain that--\r\n\r\n     The allegory in which the Mysteries and Higher Grades must be\r\n     clothed is Fire Worship and the whole philosophy of Zoroaster or of\r\n     the old Parsees who nowadays only remain in India; therefore in the\r\n     further degrees the Order is called \"Fire Worship\" (Feuer-dienst),\r\n     the \"Fire Order,\" or the \"Persian Order\"--that is, something\r\n     magnificent beyond all expectation.[503]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Persian calendar was adopted by the\r\nIlluminati.[504]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this pretence of Zoroastrianism was as pure humbug as\r\nWeishaupt's later pretence of Christianity; of the true doctrines of\r\nZoroaster he shows no conception--nor does he insist further on the\r\npoint; but the above passage would certainly lend colour to the theory\r\nthat his system was partly founded on Manichæism, that is to say, on\r\nperverted Zoroastrianism, imparted to him by a man from the East, and\r\nthat the methods of the Batinis and Fatimites may have been communicated\r\nto him through the same channel. Hence the extraordinary resemblance\r\nbetween his plan of organization and that of Abdullah ibn Maymūn,\r\nwhich consisted in political intriguing rather than in esoteric\r\nspeculation. Thus in Weishaupt's system the phraseology of Judaism, the\r\nCabalistic legends of Freemasonry, the mystical imaginings of the\r\nMartinistes, play at first no part at all. For all forms of \"theosophy,\"\r\noccultism, spiritualism, and magic Weishaupt expresses nothing but\r\ncontempt, and the Rose-Croix masons are bracketed with the Jesuits by\r\nthe Illuminati as enemies it is necessary to outwit at every turn.[505]\r\nConsequently no degree of Rose-Croix finds a place in Weishaupt's\r\nsystem, as in all the other masonic orders of the day which drew their\r\ninfluence from Eastern or Cabalistic sources.\r\n\r\nIt is true that \"Mysteries\" play a great part in the phraseology of the\r\nOrder--\"Greater and Lesser Mysteries,\" borrowed from ancient\r\nEgypt--whilst the higher initiates are decorated with such titles as\r\n\"Epopte\" and \"Hierophant,\" taken from the Eleusinian Mysteries. Yet\r\nWeishaupt's own theories appear to bear no relation whatever to these\r\nancient cults. On the contrary, the more we penetrate into his system,\r\nthe more apparent it becomes that all the formulas he employs which\r\nderive from any religious source--whether Persian, Egyptian, or\r\nChristian--merely serve to disguise a purely material purpose, a plan\r\nfor destroying the existing order of society. Thus all that was really\r\nancient in Illuminism was the destructive spirit that animated it and\r\nalso the method of organization it had imported from the East.\r\nIlluminism therefore marks an entirely new departure in the history of\r\nEuropean secret societies. Weishaupt himself indicates this as one of\r\nthe great secrets of the Order. \"Above all,\" he writes to \"Cato\" (alias\r\nZwack), \"guard the origin and the novelty of ⊙ in the most careful\r\nway.\"[506] \"The greatest mystery,\" he says again, \"must be that the\r\nthing is new; the fewer who know this the better.... Not one of the\r\nEichstadters knows this but would live or die for it that the thing is\r\nas old as Methuselah.\"[507]\r\n\r\nThis pretence of having discovered some fund of ancient wisdom is the\r\ninvariable ruse of secret society adepts; the one thing never admitted\r\nis the identity of the individuals from whom one is receiving direction.\r\nWeishaupt himself declares that he has got it all out of books by means\r\nof arduous and unremitting labour. \"What it costs me to read, study,\r\nthink, write, cross out, and re-write!\" he complains to Marius and\r\nCato.[508] Thus, according to Weishaupt the whole system is the work of\r\nhis own unaided genius, and the supreme direction remains in his hands\r\nalone. Again and again he insists on this point in his correspondence.\r\n\r\nIf this were indeed the case, Weishaupt--in view of the efficiency\r\nachieved by the Order--must have been a genius of the first water, and\r\nit is difficult to understand why so remarkable a man should not have\r\ndistinguished himself on other lines, but have remained almost unknown\r\nto posterity. It would therefore appear possible that Weishaupt,\r\nalthough undoubtedly a man of immense organizing capacity and endowed\r\nwith extraofdinary subtlety, was not in reality the sole author of\r\nIlluminism, but one of a group, which, recognizing his talents and the\r\nvalue of his untiring activity, placed the direction in his hands. Let\r\nus examine this hypothesis in the light of a document which was unknown\r\nto me when I wrote my former account of the Illuminati.\r\n\r\nBarruel has pointed out that the great error of Robison was to describe\r\nIlluminism as arising out of Freemasonry, since Weishaupt did not become\r\na Freemason until after he had founded his Order. It is true that\r\nWeishaupt was not officially received into Freemasonry until 1777, when\r\nhe was initiated into the first degree at the Lodge \"Theodore de Bon\r\nConseil,\" at Munich. From this time we find him continually occupied in\r\ntrying to discover more about the secrets of Freemasonry, whilst himself\r\nclaiming superior knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time it is by no means certain that an inner circle of\r\nthe Lodge Theodore may not have been first in the field and Weishaupt\r\nall the while an unconscious agent. A very curious light is thrown on\r\nthis question by the _Mémoires_ of Mirabeau.\r\n\r\nNow, in _The French Revolution_ and again in _World Revolution_ I quoted\r\nthe generally received opinion that Mirabeau, who was already a\r\nFreemason, was received into the Order of the Illuminati during his\r\nvisit to Berlin in 1786. To this Mr. Waite replied: \"All that is said\r\nabout Mirabeau, his visit to Berlin, and his plot to 'illuminize' French\r\nFreemasonry, may be disposed of in one sentence: there is no evidence to\r\nshow that Mirabeau ever became a Mason. The province of Barruel was to\r\ncolour everything....\"[509] Mr. Waite's statement may also be disposed\r\nof in one sentence: it is a pure invention. The province of Mr. Waite is\r\nto deny everything inconvenient to him. The evidence that Mirabeau was a\r\nFreemason does not rest on Barruel alone. M. Barthou, in his Life of\r\nMirabeau, refers to it as a matter of common knowledge, and relates that\r\na paper was found at Mirabeau's house describing a new Order to be\r\ngrafted on Freemasonry. This document will be found in its entirety in\r\nthe _Mémoires_ of Mirabeau, where it is stated that:\r\n\r\n     Mirabeau had early entered an association of Freemasonry. This\r\n     affiliation had accredited him to a Dutch lodge, and it seems that,\r\n     either spontaneously or in response to a request, he thought of\r\n     proposing an organization of which we possess the plan, written not\r\n     by his hand.... but by the hand of a copyist whom Mirabeau had\r\n     attached to himself.... This work appears to have been that of\r\n     Mirabeau; all his opinions, his principles, and his style will be\r\n     found here.[510]\r\n\r\nThe same work goes on to print the document in full, which is headed:\r\n\"Memoir concerning an intimate association to be established in the\r\nOrder of Freemasonry so as to bring it back to its true principles and\r\nto make it really tend to the good of humanity, drawn up by the F.\r\nMi----, at present named Arcesilas, in 1776.\"\r\n\r\nAs this Memoir is too long to reproduce in full here, M. Barthou's\r\n_résumé_ will serve to give an idea of its contents[511]:\r\n\r\n     He [Mirabeau] was a Freemason from his youth. There was found\r\n     amongst his papers, written by the hand of a copyist, an\r\n     international organization of Freemasonry, which no doubt he\r\n     dictated in Amsterdam. This project contains on the solidarity of\r\n     men, on the benefits of instruction, and on the \"correction of the\r\n     system of governments and of legislations\" views very superior to\r\n     those of \"The Essay on Despotism\" (1772). The mind of Mirabeau had\r\n     ripened. The duties he traces out for the \"brothers of the higher\r\n     grade\" constitute even a whole plan of reforms which resemble very\r\n     much in certain parts the work accomplished later by the\r\n     Constituent [Assembly]: suppression of servitudes on the land and\r\n     the rights of main morte, abolition of the corvées, of working\r\n     guilds and of maîtrises [freedom of companies], of customs and\r\n     excise duties, the diminution of taxation, liberty of religious\r\n     opinions and of the press, the disappearance of special\r\n     jurisdiction. In order to organize, to develop and arrive at his\r\n     end, Mirabeau invokes the example of the Jesuits: \"We have quite\r\n     contrary views,\" he says, \"that of enlightening men, of making them\r\n     free and happy, but we must and we can do this by the same means,\r\n     and who should prevent us doing for good what the Jesuits have done\r\n     for evil?\"[512]\r\n\r\nNow in this Memoir Mirabeau makes no mention of Weishaupt, but in his\r\n_Histoire de la Monarchic Prussienne_ he gives a eulogistic account of\r\nthe Bavarian Illuminati, referring to Weishaupt by name, and showing the\r\nOrder to have arisen out of Freemasonry. It will be seen that this\r\naccount corresponds point by point with the Memoir he had himself made\r\nout in 1776, that is to say, in the very year that Illuminism was\r\nfounded:\r\n\r\n     The Lodge Theodore de Bon Conseil at Munich, where there were a few\r\n     men with brains and hearts, was tired of being tossed about by the\r\n     vain promises and quarrels of Masonry. The heads resolved to graft\r\n     on to their branch another secret association to which they gave\r\n     the name of the Order of the Illuminés. They modelled it on the\r\n     Society of Jesus, whilst proposing to themselves views\r\n     diametrically opposed.\r\n\r\nMirabeau then goes on to say that the great object of the Order was the\r\namelioration of the present system of government and legislation, that\r\none of its fundamental rules was to admit \"no prince whatever his\r\nvirtues,\"[513] that it proposed to abolish--\r\n\r\n     The slavery of the peasants, the servitude of men to the soil, the\r\n     rights of main morte and all the customs and privileges which abase\r\n     humanity, the corvées under the condition of an equitable\r\n     equivalent, all the corporations, all the maîtrises, all the\r\n     burdens imposed on industry and commerce by customs, excise duties,\r\n     and taxes ... to procure a universal toleration for all religious\r\n     opinions ... to take away all the arms of superstition, to favour\r\n     the liberty of the press, etc.[514]\r\n\r\nFrom all this we see then that Mirabeau did not become an Illuminatus in\r\n1786 as I had supposed before this document was known to me, but had\r\nbeen in the Order from the beginning apparently as one of its founders,\r\nfirst under the \"Illuminated\" name of Arcesilas and later under that of\r\nLeonidas. The Memoir found at his house was thus no other than the\r\nprogramme of the Illuminati evolved by him in collaboration with an\r\ninner ring of Freemasons belonging to the Lodge Theodore. The\r\ncorrespondence of the Illuminati in fact contains several references to\r\nan inner ring under the name of \"the secret chapter of the Lodge of St.\r\nTheodore,\" which, after his initiation into Masonry, Weishaupt indicates\r\nthe necessity of bringing entirely under the control of Illuminism. It\r\nis probable that Weishaupt was in touch with this secret chapter before\r\nhis formal admission to the lodge.\r\n\r\nWhether, then, the ideas of Illuminism arose in this secret, chapter of\r\nthe Lodge Theodore independently of Weishaupt, or whether they were\r\nimparted by Weishaupt to the Lodge Theodore after the directions had\r\nbeen given him by Kölmer, it is impossible to know; but in either case\r\nthere would be some justification for Robison's assertion that\r\nIlluminism arose out of Freemasonry, or rather that it took birth\r\namongst a group of Freemasons whose aims were not those of the Order in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nWhat were these aims? A plan of social and political \"reform\" which, as\r\nM. Barthou points out, much resembled the work accomplished later by the\r\nConstituent Assembly in France. This admission is of great importance;\r\nin other words, the programme carried out by the Constituent Assembly in\r\n1789 had been largely formulated in a lodge of German Freemasons who\r\nformed the nucleus of the Illuminati, in 1776. And yet we are told that\r\nIlluminism had no influence on the French Revolution!\r\n\r\nIt will be objected that the reforms here indicated were wholly\r\nadmirable. True, the abolition of the _corvée_, of _main morte_, and of\r\nservitudes were measures that met with the approval of all right-minded\r\nmen, including the King of France himself. But what of the abolition of\r\nthe \"working guilds\" and \"all the corporations,\" that is to say, the\r\n\"trade unions\" of the period, which was carried out by the infamous Loi\r\nChapelier in 1791, a decree that is now generally recognized as one of\r\nthe strangest anomalies of the Revolution? Again, to whose interest was\r\nit to do away with the customs and excise duties of France? To establish\r\nthe absolute and unfettered liberty of the press and religious opinions?\r\nThe benefits these measures might be expected to confer on the French\r\npeople were certainly problematical, but there could be no doubt of\r\ntheir utility to men who, like Frederick the Great, wished to ruin\r\nFrance and to break the Franco-Austrian alliance by the unrestricted\r\ncirculation of libels against Marie Antoinette, who, like Mirabeau,\r\nhoped to bring about a revolution, or who, like Voltaire, wished to\r\nremove all obstacles to the spread of an anti-Christian propaganda.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore by no means impossible that Weishaupt was at first the\r\nagent of more experienced conspirators, whose purely political aims were\r\ndisguised under a plan of social reform, and who saw in the Bavarian\r\nprofessor a clever organizer to be employed in carrying out their\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nWhether this was so or not, the fact remains that from the time\r\nWeishaupt assumed control of the Order the plan of \"social reform\"\r\ndescribed by Mirabeau vanishes entirely, for not a word do we find in\r\nthe writings of the Illuminati about any pretended scheme for\r\nameliorating the lot of the people, and Illuminism becomes simply a\r\nscheme of anarchic philosophy. The French historian Henri Martin has\r\nthus admirably summed up the system elaborated by \"Spartacus\":\r\n\r\n     Weishaupt had made into an absolute theory the misanthropic gibes\r\n     _[boutades]_ of Rousseau at the invention of property and society,\r\n     and without taking into account the statement so distinctly\r\n     formulated by Rousseau on the impossibility of suppressing property\r\n     and society once they had been established, he proposed as the end\r\n     of Illuminism the abolition of property, social authority, of\r\n     nationality, and the return of the human race to the happy state in\r\n     which it formed only a single family without artificial needs,\r\n     without useless sciences, every father being priest and magistrate.\r\n     Priest of we know not what religion, for in spite of their frequent\r\n     invocations of the God of Nature, many indications lead us to\r\n     conclude that Weishaupt had, like Diderot and d'Holbach, no other\r\n     God than Nature herself. From his doctrine would naturally follow\r\n     the German ultra-Hegelianism and the system of anarchy recently\r\n     developed in France, of which the physiognomy suggests a foreign\r\n     origin.[515]\r\n\r\nThis summary of the aims of the Illuminati, which absolutely\r\ncorroborates the view of Barruel and Robison, is confirmed in detail by\r\nthe Socialist Freethinker of the nineteenth century Louis Blanc, who in\r\nhis remarkable chapter on the \"Révolutionnaires Mystiques\" refers to\r\nWeishaupt as \"One of the profoundest conspirators who have ever\r\nexisted.\"[516] George Sand also, Socialist and _intime_ of the\r\nFreemasons, wrote of \"the European conspiracy of Illuminism\" and the\r\nimmense influence exercised by the secret societies of \"mystic Germany.\"\r\nTo say, then, that Barruel and Robison were alone in proclaiming the\r\ndanger of Illuminism is simply a deliberate perversion of the truth, and\r\nit is difficult to understand why English Freemasons should have allowed\r\nthemselves to be misled on this question.\r\n\r\nThus the _Masonic Cyclopædia_ observes that the Illuminati \"were, as a\r\nrule, men of the strictest morality and humanity, and the ideas they\r\nsought to instil were those which have found universal acceptance in our\r\nown times.\" Preston, in his _Illustrations of Masonry_, also does his\r\nbest to gloss over the faults of the Order, and even \"the historian of\r\nFreemasonry\" devotes to its founder this astounding apology. After\r\ndescribing Weishaupt as the victim of Jesuit intrigue, Mr. Gould goes on\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n     He conceived the idea of combating his foes with their own\r\n     weapons, and forming a society of young men, enthusiastic in the\r\n     cause of humanity, who should gradually be trained to work as one\r\n     man to one end--the destruction of evil and the enhancement of good\r\n     in this world. Unfortunately he had unconsciously imbibed that most\r\n     pernicious doctrine that the end justifies the means, and his whole\r\n     plan reveals the effects of his youthful teaching.... The man\r\n     himself was without guile, ignorant of men, knowing them only by\r\n     books, a learned professor, an enthusiast who took a wrong course\r\n     in all innocence, and the faults of his head have been heavily\r\n     visited upon his memory in spite of the rare qualities of his\r\n     heart.[517]\r\n\r\nOne can only conclude that these extraordinary exonerations of an Order\r\nbitterly hostile to the true aims of Masonry proceed from ignorance of\r\nthe real nature of Illuminism. In order to judge of this it is only\r\nnecessary to consult the writings of the Illuminati themselves, which\r\nare contained in the following works:\r\n\r\n1. _Einige Originalschriften des Illuminatenordens_ (Munich, 1787).\r\n\r\n2. _Nachtrag von weitern Originalschriften, etc._ (Munich, 1787).\r\n\r\n3. _Die neuesten Arbeiten des Spartacus und Philo in dem\r\nIlluminaten-Orden_ (Munich, 1794).\r\n\r\nAll these consist in the correspondence and papers of the Order which\r\nwere seized by the Bavarian Government at the houses of two of the\r\nmembers, Zwack and Bassus, and published by order of the Elector. The\r\nauthenticity of these documents has never been denied even by the\r\nIlluminati themselves; Weishaupt, in his published defence, endeavoured\r\nonly to explain away the most incriminating passages. The publishers,\r\nmoreover, were careful to state at the beginning of the first volume:\r\n\"Those who might have any doubts on the authenticity of this collection\r\nmay present themselves at the Secret Archives here, where, on request,\r\nthe original documents will be laid before them.\" This precaution\r\nrendered all dispute impossible.\r\n\r\nSetting Barruel and Robison entirely aside, we shall now see from the\r\nevidence of their own writings, how far the Illuminati can be regarded\r\nas a praiseworthy and cruelly maligned Order. Let us begin with their\r\nattitude towards Freemasonry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIlluminism and Freemasonry\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of Weishaupt's admission into Freemasonry his whole\r\nconduct was a violation of the Masonic code. Instead of proceeding after\r\nthe recognized manner by successive stages of initiation, he set himself\r\nto find out further secrets by underhand methods and then to turn them\r\nto the advantage of his own system. Thus about a year after his\r\ninitiation he writes to Cato (alias Zwack): \"I have succeeded in\r\nobtaining a profound glimpse into the secret of the Freemasons. I know\r\ntheir whole aim and shall impart it all at the right time in one of the\r\nhigher degrees.\"[518]\r\n\r\nCato is then deputed to make further discoveries through an Italian\r\nFreemason, the Abbé Marotti, which he records triumphantly in his diary:\r\n\r\n     Interview with the Abbé Marotti on the question of Masonry, when he\r\n     explained to me the whole secret, which is founded on old religion\r\n     and Church history, and imparted to me all the higher degrees up to\r\n     the Scottish. Informed Spartacus of this.[519]\r\n\r\nSpartacus, however, unimpressed by this communication, replied drily:\r\n\r\n     Whether you know the aim of Masonry I doubt. I have myself included\r\n     an insight into this structure in my plan, but reserved it for\r\n     later degrees.[520]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt then decides that all illuminated \"Areopagites\" shall take the\r\nfirst three degrees of Freemasonry[521]; but further:\r\n\r\n     That we shall have a masonic lodge of our own. That we shall regard\r\n     this as our nursery garden. That to some of these Masons we shall\r\n     not at once reveal that we have something more than the Masons\r\n     have. That at every opportunity we shall cover ourselves with this\r\n     [Masonry].... All those who are not suited to the work shall remain\r\n     in the masonic Lodge and advance in that without knowing anything\r\n     of the further system.[522]\r\n\r\nWe shall find this plan of an inner secret circle concealed within\r\nFreemasonry persisting up to our own day.\r\n\r\nWeishaupt, however, admits himself puzzled with regard to the past of\r\nMasonry, and urges \"Porcius\" to find out more on this question from the\r\nAbbé Marotti:\r\n\r\n     See whether through him you can discover the real history, origin,\r\n     and the first founders of Masonry, for on this alone I am still\r\n     undecided.[523]\r\n\r\nBut it is in \"Philo,\" the Baron von Knigge, a Freemason and member of\r\nthe Stride Observance, in which he was known as the Eques a Cygno, that\r\nWeishaupt finds his most efficient investigator. Thus \"Philo\" writes to\r\n\"Spartacus\":\r\n\r\n     I have now found in Cassel the best man, on whom I cannot\r\n     congratulate ourselves enough: he is Mauvillon, Grand Master of one\r\n     of the Royal York Lodges. So with him we have the whole lodge in\r\n     our hands. He has also got from there all their miserable degrees\r\n     [_Er hat auch von dort aus alle ihre elenden Grade_].[524]\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Weishaupt thereupon exclaims joyfully: \"Philo does more\r\nthan we all expected, and he is the man who alone will carry it all\r\nthrough.\"[525] Weishaupt then occupies himself in trying to get a\r\n\"Constitution\" from London, evidently without success, and also in\r\nwresting the Lodge Theodore in Munich from the control of Berlin in\r\norder to substitute his own domination, so that \"the whole secret\r\nchapter will be subjected to our ⊙, leave everything to it, and await\r\nfurther degrees from it alone.\"[526]\r\n\r\nIn all this Weishaupt shows himself not only an intriguer but a\r\ncharlatan, inventing mysteries and degrees to impose on the credulity of\r\nhis followers. \"The mysteries, or so-called secret truths, are the\r\nfinest of all,\" he writes to \"Philipo Strozzi,\" \"and give me much\r\ntrouble.\"[527] So whilst heartily despising Freemasonry, theosophy,\r\nRosicrucianism, and mysticism of every kind, his association with Philo\r\nleads him to perceive the utility of all these as a bait, and he allows\r\nPhilo to draw up plans for a degree of Scottish Knight. But the result\r\nis pitiable, Philo's composition, a \"semi-theosophical discourse and\r\nexplanation of hieroglyphics\" is characterized by Weishaupt as gibberish\r\n(_kauderwelsche_).[528]\r\n\r\n     Philo [he says again] is full of such follies, which betray his\r\n     small mind.... On the Illuminatus Major follows the miserable\r\n     degree of Scottish Knight entirely of his composition, and on the\r\n     degree of Priest an equally miserable degree of Regent, ... but I\r\n     have already composed four more degrees compared to the worst of\r\n     which the Priest's degree will be child's play, but I shall tell no\r\n     one about it till I see how the thing goes....[529]\r\n\r\nThe perfidy of the Illuminati with regard to the Freemasons is therefore\r\napparent. Even Mounier, who set out to refute Barruel on the strength of\r\nthe information supplied to him by the Illuminatus Bode, admits their\r\nduplicity in this respect.\r\n\r\n     Weishaupt [says Mounier] made the acquaintance of a Hanoverian, the\r\n     Baron von Knigge, a famous intriguer, long practised in the\r\n     charlatanism of lodges of Freemasons. On his advice new degrees\r\n     were added to the old ones, and it was resolved to profit by\r\n     Freemasonry whilst profoundly despising it. They decided that the\r\n     degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason, and\r\n     Scotch Knight should be added to those of the Illuminati, and that\r\n     they would boast of possessing exclusively the real secrets of the\r\n     Freemasons and affirm that Illuminism was the real primitive\r\n     Freemasonry.\r\n\r\n\"The papers of the Order seized in Bavaria and published,\" Mounier says\r\nagain, show that \"the Illuminati employed the forms of Freemasonry, but\r\nthat they considered it in itself, apart from their own degrees, as a\r\npuerile absurdity and that they detested the Rose-Croix.\" Mounier, as a\r\ngood disciple of Bode, takes much the same view and pities the _naïveté_\r\nof the Freemasons, who, \"like so many children, spend a great part of\r\nthe time in their lodges playing at chapel.\"\r\n\r\nWhy in the face of all this should any British Masons take up the\r\ncudgels for the Illuminati and vilify Robison and Barruel for exposing\r\nthem? The American Mackey, as a consistent Freemason, shows scant\r\nsympathy for this traitor in the masonic camp. \"Weishaupt,\" he writes,\r\n\"was a radical in politics and an infidel in religion, and he organized\r\nthis association, not more for the purpose of aggrandizing himself, than\r\nof overturning Christianity and the institutions of society.\" And in a\r\nfootnote he adds that Robison's _Proofs of a Conspiracy_ \"contain a very\r\nexcellent exposition of the nature of this pseudo-masonic\r\ninstitution.\"[530]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Weishaupt was one of the greatest enemies of British\r\nFreemasonry who ever lived, and genuine Freemasons will do themselves no\r\ngood by defending him or his abominable system.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how far, apart from their rôle in Masonry, the Illuminati\r\ncan be regarded as noble idealists striving for the welfare of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdealism of the Illuminati\r\n\r\n\r\nThe line of defence adopted by the apologists of the Illuminati is\r\nalways to quote the admirable principles professed by the Order, the\r\n\"beautiful ideas\" that run through their writings, and to show what\r\nexcellent people were to be found amongst them.\r\n\r\nOf course on their face value the Illuminati appear wholly admirable, of\r\ncourse there is nothing easier than to find innumerable passages in\r\ntheir writings breathing a spirit of the loftiest aspiration, and of\r\ncourse many excellent men figured amongst the patrons of the Order. All\r\nthis is the mere stock-in-trade of the secret society leader as of the\r\nfraudulent company promoter, to whom the first essentials are a glowing\r\nprospectus and a long list of highly respectable patrons who know\r\nnothing whatever about the inner workings of the concern. These methods,\r\npursued as early as the ninth century by Abdullah ibn Maymūn, enter\r\nlargely into the policy of Frederick the Great, Voltaire, and his\r\n\"brothers\" in philosophy--or in Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nThe resemblances between Weishaupt's correspondence and that of Voltaire\r\nand of Frederick the Great are certainly very striking. All at moments\r\nprofess respect for Christianity whilst working to destroy it. Thus just\r\nas Voltaire in one letter to d'Alembert expresses his horror at the\r\npublication of an anti-Christian pamphlet, _Le Testament de Jean\r\nMeslier,[531]_ and in another urges him to have it circulated in\r\nthousands all over France,[532] so Weishaupt is careful in general to\r\nexhibit the face of a benign philosopher and even of a Christian\r\nevangelist; it is only at moments that he drops the mask and reveals the\r\ngrinning satyr behind it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in the published statutes of the Illuminati no hint of\r\nsubversive intentions will be found; indeed the \"Obligation\" expressly\r\nstates that \"nothing against the State, religion, or morals is\r\nundertaken.\"\r\n\r\nYet what is Weishaupt's real political theory? No other than that of\r\nmodern Anarchy, that man should govern himself and rulers should be\r\ngradually done away with. But he is careful to deprecate all ideas of\r\nviolent revolution--the process is to be accomplished by the most\r\npeaceful methods. Let us see how gently he leads up to the final\r\nconclusion:\r\n\r\n     The first stage in the life of the whole human race is savagery,\r\n     rough nature, in which the family is the only society, and hunger\r\n     and thirst are easily satisfied, ... in which man enjoys the two\r\n     most excellent goods, Equality and Liberty, to their fullest\r\n     extent.... In these circumstances ... health was his usual\r\n     condition.... Happy men, who were not yet enough enlightened to\r\n     lose their peace of mind and to be conscious of the unhappy\r\n     mainsprings and causes of our misery, love of power ... envy ...\r\n     illnesses and all the results of imagination.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which man fell from this primitive state of felicity is\r\nthen described:\r\n\r\n     As families increased, means of subsistence began to lack, the\r\n     nomadic life ceased, property was instituted, men established\r\n     themselves firmly, and through agriculture families drew near each\r\n     other, thereby language developed and through living together men\r\n     began to measure themselves against each other, etc.... But here\r\n     was the cause of the downfall of freedom; equality vanished. Man\r\n     felt new unknown needs....[533]\r\n\r\nThus men became dependent like minors under the guardianship of kings;\r\nthe human must attain its majority and become self-governing:\r\n\r\n     Why should it be impossible that the human race should attain to\r\n     its highest perfection, the capacity to guide itself? Why should\r\n     anyone be eternally led who understands how to lead himself?[534]\r\n\r\nFurther, men must learn not only to be independent of kings but of each\r\nother:\r\n\r\n     Who has need of another depends on him and has resigned his rights.\r\n     So to need little is the first step to freedom; therefore savages\r\n     and the most highly enlightened are perhaps the only free men. The\r\n     art of more and more limiting one's needs is at the same time the\r\n     art of attaining freedom....[535]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt then goes on to show how the further evil of Patriotism arose:\r\n\r\n     With the origin of nations and peoples the world ceased to be a\r\n     great family, a single kingdom: the great tie of nature was\r\n     torn.... Nationalism took the place of human love.... Now it became\r\n     a virtue to magnify one's fatherland at the expense of whoever was\r\n     not enclosed within its limits, now as a means to this narrow end\r\n     it was allowed to despise and outwit foreigners or indeed even to\r\n     insult them. This virtue was called Patriotism....[536]\r\n\r\nAnd so by narrowing down affection to one's fellow-citizens, the members\r\nof one's family, and even to oneself:\r\n\r\n     There arose out of Patriotism, Localism, the family spirit, and\r\n     finally Egoism.... Diminish Patriotism, then men will learn to know\r\n     each other again as such, their dependence on each other will be\r\n     lost, the bond of union will widen out....[537]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the whole of Weishaupt's theory was in reality a\r\nnew rendering of the ancient secret tradition relating to the fall of\r\nman and the loss of his primitive felicity; but whilst the ancient\r\nreligions taught the hope of a Redeemer who should restore man to his\r\nformer state, Weishaupt looks to man alone for his restoration. \"Men,\"\r\nhe observes, \"no longer loved men but only such and such men. The word\r\nwas quite lost....\"[538] Thus in Weishaupt's masonic system the \"lost\r\nword\" is \"Man,\" and its recovery is interpreted by the idea that Man\r\nshould find himself again. Further on Weishaupt goes on to show how \"the\r\nredemption of the human race is to be brought about\".\r\n\r\n     These means are secret schools of wisdom, these were from all time\r\n     the archives of Nature and of human rights, through them will Man\r\n     be saved from his Fall, princes and nations will disappear without\r\n     violence from the earth, the human race will become one family and\r\n     the world the abode of reasonable men. Morality alone will bring\r\n     about this change imperceptibly. Every father of a family will be,\r\n     as formerly Abraham and the patriarchs, the priest and unfettered\r\n     lord of his family, and Reason will be the only code of Man. This\r\n     is one of our greatest secrets....[539]\r\n\r\nBut whilst completely eliminating any idea of divine power outside Man\r\nand framing his system on purely political lines, Weishaupt is careful\r\nnot to shock the susceptibilities of his followers by any open\r\nrepudiation of Christian doctrines; on the contrary, he invokes Christ\r\nat every turn and sometimes even in language so apparently earnest and\r\neven beautiful that one is almost tempted to believe in his sincerity.\r\nThus he writes:\r\n\r\n     This our great and unforgettable Master, Jesus of Nazareth,\r\n     appeared at a time in the world when it was sunk in depravity....\r\n     The first followers of His teaching are not wise men but simple,\r\n     chosen from the lowest class of the people, so as to show that His\r\n     teaching should be possible and comprehensible to all classes and\r\n     conditions of men.... He carries out this teaching by means of the\r\n     most blameless life in conformity with it, and seals and confirms\r\n     this with His blood and death. These laws which He shows as the way\r\n     to salvation are only two: love of God and love of one's neighbour;\r\n     more He asks of no one.[540]\r\n\r\nSo far no Lutheran pastor could have expressed himself better. But one\r\nmust study Weishaupt's writings as a whole to apprehend the true measure\r\nof his belief in Christ's teaching.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, as we have already seen, his first idea was to make Fire Worship\r\nthe religion of Illuminism; the profession of Christianity therefore\r\nappears to have been an after-thought. Evidently Weishaupt discovered,\r\nas others have done, that Christianity lends itself more readily to\r\nsubversive ideas than any other religion. And in the passages which\r\nfollow we find him adopting the old ruse of representing Christ as a\r\nCommunist and as a secret-society adept. Thus he goes on to explain that\r\n\"if Jesus preaches contempt of riches, He wishes to teach us the\r\nreasonable use of them and prepare for the community of goods introduced\r\nby Him,\"[541] and in which, Weishaupt adds later, He lived with His\r\ndisciples.[542] But this secret doctrine is only to be apprehended by\r\ninitiates:\r\n\r\n     No one ... has so cleverly concealed the high meaning of His\r\n     teaching, and no one finally has so surely and easily directed men\r\n     on to the path of freedom as our great master Jesus of Nazareth.\r\n     This secret meaning and natural consequence of His teaching He hid\r\n     completely, for Jesus had a secret doctrine, as we see in more than\r\n     one place of the Scriptures.[543]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt thus contrives to give a purely political interpretation to\r\nChrist's teaching:\r\n\r\n     The secret preserved through the Disciplinam Arcani, and the aim\r\n     appearing through all His words and deeds, is to give back to men\r\n     their original liberty and equality.... Now one can understand how\r\n     far Jesus was the Redeemer and Saviour of the world.[544]\r\n\r\nThe mission of Christ was therefore by means of Reason to make men\r\ncapable of freedom[545]: \"When at last reason becomes the religion of\r\nman, so will the problem be solved.\"[546]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt goes on to show that Freemasonry can be interpreted in the\r\nsame manner. The secret doctrine concealed in the teaching of Christ was\r\nhanded down by initiates who \"hid themselves and their doctrine under\r\nthe cover of Freemasonry,\"[547] and in a long explanation of Masonic\r\nhieroglyphics he indicates the analogies between the Hiramic legend and\r\nthe story of Christ. \"I say then Hiram is Christ,\" and after giving one\r\nof his reasons for this assertion, adds: \"Here then is much ground\r\ngained, although I myself cannot help laughing at this explanation\r\n[_obwohl ich selbst über diese Explication im Grund lachen muss_].\"[548]\r\nWeishaupt then proceeds to give further interpretations of his own\r\ndevising to the masonic ritual, including an imaginary translation of\r\ncertain words supposed to be derived from Hebrew, and ends up by saying:\r\n\"One will be able to show several more resemblances between Hiram and\r\nthe life and death of Christ, or drag them in by the hair.\"[549] So much\r\nfor Weishaupt's respect for the Grand Legend of Freemasonry!\r\n\r\nIn this manner Weishaupt demonstrates that \"Freemasonry is hidden\r\nChristianity, at least my explanations of the hieroglyphics fit this\r\nperfectly; and in the way in which I explain Christianity no one need be\r\nashamed to be a Christian, for I leave the name and substitute for it\r\nReason.\"[550]\r\n\r\nBut this is of course only the secret of what Weishaupt calls \"real\r\nFreemasonry\"[551] in contradistinction to the official kind, which he\r\nregards as totally unenlightened: \"Had not the noble and elect remained\r\nin the background ... new depravity would have broken out in the human\r\nrace, and through Regents, Priests, and Freemasons Reason would have\r\nbeen banished from the earth.\"[552]\r\n\r\nIn Weishaupt's masonic system, therefore, the designs of the Order with\r\nregard to religion are not confided to the mere Freemasons, but only to\r\nthe Illuminati. Under the heading of \"Higher Mysteries\" Weishaupt\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     The man who is good for nothing better remains a Scottish Knight.\r\n     If he is, however, a particularly industrious co-ordinator\r\n     [_Sammler_], observer, worker, he becomes a Priest.... If there are\r\n     amongst these [Priests] high speculative intellects, they become\r\n     Magi. These collect and put in order the higher philosophical\r\n     system and work at the People's Religion, which the Order will\r\n     next give to the world. Should these high geniuses also be fit to\r\n     rule the world, they become Regents. This is the last degree.[553]\r\n\r\nPhilo (the Baron von Knigge) also throws an interesting light on the\r\nreligious designs of the Illuminati. In a letter to Cato he explains the\r\nnecessity of devising a system that will satisfy fanatics and\r\nfreethinkers alike: \"So as to work on both these classes of men and\r\nunite them, we must find an explanation to the Christian religion ...\r\nmake this the secret of Freemasonry and turn it to our purpose.\"[554]\r\nPhilo continues:\r\n\r\n     We say then: Jesus wished to introduce no new religion, but only to\r\n     restore natural religion and reason to their old rights. Thereby he\r\n     wished to unite men in a great universal association, and through\r\n     the spread of a wiser morality, enlightenment, and the combating of\r\n     all prejudices to make them capable of governing themselves; so the\r\n     secret meaning of his teaching was to lead men without revolution\r\n     to universal liberty and equality. There are many passages in the\r\n     Bible which can be made use of and explained, and so all\r\n     quarrelling between the sects ceases if one can find a reasonable\r\n     meaning in the teaching of Jesus--be it true or not. As, however,\r\n     this simple religion was afterwards distorted, so were these\r\n     teachings imparted to us through Disciplinam Arcani and finally\r\n     through Freemasonry, and all masonic hieroglyphics can be explained\r\n     with this object. Spartacus has collected very good data for this\r\n     and I have myself added to them, ... and so I have got both degrees\r\n     ready....\r\n\r\n     Now therefore that people see that we are the only real and true\r\n     Christians, we can say a word more against priests and princes, but\r\n     I have so managed that after previous tests I can receive pontiffs\r\n     and kings in this degree. In the higher Mysteries we must then\r\n     (_a_) disclose the pious fraud and (_b_) reveal from all writings\r\n     the origin of all religious lies and their connexion....[555]\r\n\r\nSo admirably did this ruse succeed that we find Spartacus writing\r\ntriumphantly:\r\n\r\n     You cannot imagine what consideration and sensation our Priest's\r\n     degree is arousing. The most wonderful thing is that great\r\n     Protestant and reformed theologians who belong to ⊙ [Illuminism]\r\n     still believe that the religious teaching imparted in it contains\r\n     the true and genuine spirit of the Christian religion. Oh! men, of\r\n     what cannot you be persuaded? I never thought that I should become\r\n     the founder of a new religion.[556]\r\n\r\nIt is on the \"illuminized\" clergy and professors that Weishaupt counts\r\nprincipally for the work of the Order.\r\n\r\n     Through the influence of the Brothers [he writes], the Jesuits have\r\n     been removed from all professorships, and the University of\r\n     Ingoldstadt has been quite cleansed of them....[557]\r\n\r\nThus the way is cleared for Weishaupt's adepts.\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Cadets also comes under the control of the Order:\r\n\r\n     All the professors are members of the Illuminati, ... so will all\r\n     the pupils become disciples of Illuminism.[558]\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n\r\n     We have provided our clerical members with good benefices,\r\n     parishes, posts at Court.\r\n\r\n     Through our influence Arminius and Cortez have been made professors\r\n     at Ephesus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The German schools are quite under [the influence of] ⊙ and now\r\n     only members have charge of them.\r\n\r\n     The charitable association is also directed by ⊙.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Soon we shall draw over to us the whole Bartholomew Institute for\r\n     young clergymen; the preparations have already been made and the\r\n     prospects are very good, by this means we shall be able to provide\r\n     the whole of Bavaria with proper priests.[559]\r\n\r\nBut religion and Freemasonry are not the only means by which Illuminism\r\ncan be spread.\r\n\r\n     We must consider [says Weishaupt], how we can begin to work under\r\n     another form. If only the aim is achieved, it does not matter under\r\n     what cover it takes place, and a cover is always necessary. For in\r\n     concealment lies a great part of our strength. For this reason we\r\n     must always cover ourselves with the name of another society. The\r\n     lodges that are under Freemasonry are in the meantime the most\r\n     suitable cloak for our high purpose, because the world is already\r\n     accustomed to expect nothing great from them which merits\r\n     attention.... As in the spiritual Orders of the Roman Church,\r\n     religion was, alas! only a pretence, so must our Order also in a\r\n     nobler way try to conceal itself behind a learned society or\r\n     something of the kind.... A society concealed in this manner cannot\r\n     be worked against. In case of a prosecution or of treason the\r\n     superiors cannot be discovered.... We shall be shrouded in\r\n     impenetrable darkness from spies and emissaries of other\r\n     societies.[560]\r\n\r\nIn order to give a good appearance to the Order, Weishaupt particularly\r\nindicates the necessity for enlisting esteemed and \"respectable\"\r\npersons,[561] but above all young men whom he regards as the most likely\r\nsubjects. \"I cannot use men as they are,\" he observes, \"but I must first\r\nform them.\"[562] Youth naturally lends itself best to this process.\r\n\"Seek the society of young people,\" Weishaupt writes to Ajax, \"watch\r\nthem, and if one of them pleases you, lay your hand on him.\"[563] \"Seek\r\nout young and already skilful people.... Our people must be engaging,\r\nenterprising, intriguing, and adroit. Above all the first.\"[564]\r\n\r\nIf possible they should also be good-looking--\"beautiful people,\r\n_cæteris paribus_....\"\r\n\r\n     Such people have generally gentle manners, a tender heart, and are,\r\n     when well practised in other things, of the greatest use in\r\n     undertakings, for their first glance attracts; but their spirit\r\n     _n'a pas la profondeur des physiognomies sombres_. They are,\r\n     however, also less disposed to riots and disturbances than the\r\n     darker physiognomies. That is why one must know how to use one's\r\n     people. Above all, the high, soulful eye pleases me and the free,\r\n     open brow.[565]\r\n\r\nWith these novices the adept of Illuminism is to proceed slowly, talking\r\nbackwards and forwards:\r\n\r\n     One must speak, first in one way, then in another, so as not to\r\n     commit oneself and to make one's real way of thinking impenetrable\r\n     to one's inferiors.[566]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt also insists on the importance of exciting the candidate's\r\ncuriosity and then drawing back again, after the manner of the Fatimite\r\n_dais_:\r\n\r\n     I have no fault to find with your [methods of] reception\r\n     [\"Spartacus\" writes to \"Cato\"], except that they are too quick....\r\n     You should proceed gradually in a roundabout way by means of\r\n     suspense and expectations, so as first to arouse indefinite, vague\r\n     curiosity, and then when the candidate declares himself, present\r\n     the object, which he will then seize with both hands.[567]\r\n\r\nBy this means his vanity will also be flattered, because one will arouse\r\nthe pleasure of \"knowing something which everyone does not know, and\r\nabout which the greater part of the world is groping in darkness.\"[568]\r\n\r\nFor the same reason the candidate must be impressed with the importance\r\nof secret societies and the part they have played in the destinies of\r\nthe world:\r\n\r\n     One illustrates this by the Order of the Jesuits, of the\r\n     Freemasons, by the secret associations of the ancients, one asserts\r\n     that all events in the world occur from a hundred secret springs\r\n     and causes, to which secret associations above all belong; one\r\n     arouses the pleasure of quiet, hidden power and of insight into\r\n     hidden secrets.[569]\r\n\r\nAt this point one is to begin to \"show glimpses and to let fall here and\r\nthere remarks that may be interpreted in two ways,\" so as to bring the\r\ncandidate to the point of saying: \"If I had the chance to enter such an\r\nassociation, I would go into it at once.\" \"These discourses,\" says\r\nWeishaupt, \"are to be often repeated.\"[570]\r\n\r\nIn the discourse of reception to the \"Illuminatus Dirigens,\" the appeal\r\nto love of power plays the most important part:\r\n\r\n     Do you realize sufficiently what it means to rule--to rule in a\r\n     secret Society? Not only over the lesser or more important of the\r\n     populace, but over the best men, over men of all ranks, nations,\r\n     and religions, to rule without external force, to unite them\r\n     indissolubly, to breathe one spirit and soul into them, men\r\n     distributed over all parts of the world?...[571]\r\n\r\n     And finally, do you know what secret societies are? what a place\r\n     they occupy in the great kingdom of the world's events? Do you\r\n     really think they are unimportant, transitory appearances?[572]\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\nBut the admission of political aims is reserved only for the higher\r\ngrades of the Order. \"With the beginner,\" says Weishaupt, \"we must be\r\ncareful about books on religion and the State. I have reserved these in\r\nmy plan for the higher degrees.\"[573] Accordingly the discourse to the\r\n\"Minerval\" is expressly designed to put him off the track. Thus the\r\ninitiator is to say to him:\r\n\r\n     After two years' reflection, experience, intercourse, reading of\r\n     the graduated writings and information, you will necessarily have\r\n     formed the idea that the final aim of our Society is nothing less\r\n     than to win power and riches, to undermine secular or religious\r\n     government, and to obtain the mastery of the world, and so on. If\r\n     you have represented our Society to yourself from this point of\r\n     view or have entered it in this expectation, you have mightily\r\n     deceived yourself....[574]\r\n\r\nThe initiator, without informing the Minerval of the real aim of the\r\nSociety, then goes on to say that he is now free to leave it if he\r\nwishes. By this means the leaders were able to eliminate ambitious\r\npeople who might become their rivals to power and to form their ranks\r\nout of men who would submit to be led blindly onward by unseen\r\ndirectors. \"My circumstances necessitate,\" Spartacus writes to Cato,\r\n\"that I should remain hidden from most of the members as long as I live.\r\nI am obliged to do everything through five or six persons.\"[575] So\r\ncarefully was this secret guarded that until the papers of the\r\nIlluminati were seized in 1786 no one outside this inner circle knew\r\nthat Weishaupt was the head of the Order. Yet if we are to believe his\r\nown assertions, he had been throughout in supreme control. Again and\r\nagain he impresses on his _intimes_ the necessity for unity of command\r\nin the Order: \"One must show how easy it would be for one clever head to\r\ndirect hundreds and thousands of men,\"[576] and he illustrates this\r\nsystem by the table reproduced on the next page, to which he appends the\r\nfollowing explanation:\r\n\r\n     I have two immediately below me into whom I breathe my whole\r\n     spirit, and each of these two has again two others, and so on. In\r\n     this way I can set a thousand men in motion and on fire in the\r\n     simplest manner, and in this way one must impart orders and operate\r\n     on politics.[577]\r\n\r\nThus, as in the case of Abdullah ibn Maymūn's society, \"the\r\nextraordinary result was brought about that a multitude of men of divers\r\nbeliefs were all working together for an object known only to a few of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nEnough has now been quoted from the correspondence of the Illuminati to\r\nshow their aims and methods according to their own admissions. We shall\r\nnow see how far their apologists are justified in describing them as\r\n\"men of the strictest morality and humanity.\"[578] Doubtless there were\r\nmany excellent people in the outer ranks of the Order, but this is not\r\nthe contention of Mr. Gould, who expressly states that \"all the\r\nprominent members of this association were estimable men both in public\r\nand in private life.\" These further extracts from their correspondence\r\nmay be left to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacter of the Illuminati\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June 1782 Weishaupt writes to \"Cato\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     Oh, in politics and morality you are far behind, my gentlemen.\r\n     Judge further if such a man as Marcus Aurelius[579] finds out how\r\n     wretched it [Illuminism] appears in Athens [Munich]; what a\r\n     collection of immoral men, of whoremongers, liars, debtors,\r\n     boasters, and vain fools they have amongst them. If he saw all\r\n     that, what do you suppose the man would think? Would he not be\r\n     ashamed to find himself in such an association, in which the\r\n     leaders arouse the greatest expectations and carry out the best\r\n     plan in such a miserable manner? And all this out of caprice,\r\n     expediency, etc. Judge whether I am not right.[580]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Diagram of Weishapt's System. From _Nachtrag von\r\n     weitern Originalschriften der Illuminatensekte_, p. 32. München,\r\n     1787.]\r\n\r\n     From Thebes [Freysing] I hear fatal news; they have received into\r\n     the lodge the scandal of the whole town, the dissolute debtor\r\n     Propertius, who is trumpeted abroad by the whole \"personnel\" of\r\n     Athens [Munich], Thebes and Erzerum [Eichstadt]; D. also appears\r\n     to be a bad man. Socrates who would be a capital man [_ein Capital\r\n     Mann_] is continually drunk, Augustus in the worst repute, and\r\n     Alcibiades sits the whole day with the innkeeper's wife sighing and\r\n     pining: Tiberius tried in Corinth to rape the sister of Democedes\r\n     and the husband came in. In Heaven's name, what are these for\r\n     Areopagites! We upper ones, write, read and work ourselves to\r\n     death, offer to ⊙ our health, fame and fortune, whilst these\r\n     gentlemen indulge their weaknesses, go a whoring, cause scandals\r\n     and yet are Areopagites and want to know about everything.[581]\r\n\r\n     Concerning Arminius there are great complaints.... He is an\r\n     unbearable, obstinate, arrogant, vain fool![582]\r\n\r\n     Let Celsus, Marius, Scipio, and Ajax do what they will ... no one\r\n     does us so much harm as Celsus, no one is less to be reasoned with\r\n     than Celsus, and perhaps few could have been so much use to us as\r\n     Celsus.... Marius is obstinate and can see no great plan, Scipio is\r\n     negligent, and of Ajax I will not speak at all.... Confucius is\r\n     worth very little: he is too inquisitive and a terrible chatterer\r\n     [_ein grausamer Schwatzer_].[583]\r\n\r\n     Agrippa must be quite struck off our list, for the rumour goes\r\n     round ... that he has stolen a gold and silver watch together with\r\n     a ring from our best fellow-worker Sulla.[584]\r\n\r\nIt will doubtless be suggested at this point that all these letters\r\nmerely portray the lofty idealist sorrowing over the frailties of his\r\nerring disciples, but let us hear what Weishaupt has to say about\r\nhimself. In a letter to Marius (Hertel) he writes:\r\n\r\n     And now in the strictest confidence, a matter near my heart, which\r\n     robs me of all rest, makes me incapable of anything and drives me\r\n     to despair. I stand in danger of losing my honour and my reputation\r\n     which gave me so much power over our people. Think, my\r\n     sister-in-law is expecting a child.[585] I have for this purpose\r\n     sent to Euriphon in Athens to solicit the marriage licence and\r\n     Promotorial from Rome, you see how much depends on this and that no\r\n     time must be lost; every minute is precious. But if the\r\n     dispensation does not arrive, what shall I do? How shall I make\r\n     amends to the person since I alone am to blame? We have already\r\n     tried several ways to get rid of the child; she herself was\r\n     resolved for anything. But Euriphon is too timid and yet I see no\r\n     other expedient, if I could ensure the silence of Celsus he could\r\n     help me and indeed he already promised me this three years\r\n     ago....[586] If you can help me out of this dilemma, you will give\r\n     me back life, honour, peace and power to work.... I do not know\r\n     what devil led me astray, I who always in these circumstances took\r\n     extreme precautions.[587]\r\n\r\nA little later Weishaupt writes again:\r\n\r\n     All fatalities happen to me at the same time. Now there is my\r\n     mother dead! Corpse, wedding, christening all in a short time, one\r\n     on the top of the other. What a wonderful mix-up\r\n     [_mischmasch_]![588]\r\n\r\nSo much for what Mr. Gould calls the \"rare qualities\" of Weishaupt's\r\nheart. Let us now listen to the testimony of Weishaupt's principal\r\ncoadjutor, Philo (the Baron von Knigge), to whom the \"historian of\r\nFreemasonry\" refers as \"a lovable enthusiast.\" In all subversive\r\nassociations, whether open or secret, directed by men who aim at power,\r\na moment is certain to arrive when the ambitions of the leaders come\r\ninto conflict. This is the history of every revolutionary organization\r\nduring the last 150 years. It was when the inevitable climax had been\r\nreached between Weishaupt and Knigge that \"Philo\" wrote to \"the most\r\nloving Cato\" in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     It is not Mahomed and A. who are so much to blame for my break with\r\n     Spartacus, as the Jesuitical conduct of this man which has so often\r\n     turned us against each other in order to rule despotically over\r\n     men, who, if they have not perhaps such a rich imagination as\r\n     himself, also do not possess so much cuteness and cunning,\r\n     etc.[589]\r\n\r\nIn a further letter Philo goes on to enumerate the services he has\r\nrendered to Weishaupt in the past:\r\n\r\n     At the bidding of Spartacus I have written against ex-Jesuits and\r\n     Rosicrucians, persecuted people who never did me any harm, thrown\r\n     the _Stricte Observance_ into confusion, drawn the best amongst\r\n     them to us, told them of the worthiness of ⊙, of its power, its\r\n     age, the excellence of its Chiefs, the blamelessness of its higher\r\n     leaders, the importance of its knowledge, and given great ideas of\r\n     the uprightness of its views; those amongst us who are now working\r\n     so actively for us but cling much to religiousness [_sehr an\r\n     Religiosität kleben_] and who feared our intention was to spread\r\n     Deism, I have sought to persuade that the higher Superiors had\r\n     nothing less than this intention. Gradually, however, I shall work\r\n     it as I please [_nach und nach wirke ich dock was ich will_]. If I\r\n     now were to ... give a hint to the Jesuits and Rosicrucians as to\r\n     who is persecuting them ... if I were to make known (to a few\r\n     people) the Jesuitical character of the man who leads perhaps all\r\n     of us by the nose, uses us for his ambitious schemes, sacrifices us\r\n     as often as his obstinacy requires, [if I were to make known to\r\n     them] what they have to fear from such a man, from such a machine\r\n     behind which perhaps Jesuits may be concealed or might conceal\r\n     themselves; if I were to assure those who seek for secrets that\r\n     they have nothing to expect; if I were to confide to those who hold\r\n     religion dear, the principles of the General; ... if I were to draw\r\n     the attention of the lodges to an association behind which the\r\n     Illuminati are concealed; if I were again to associate myself with\r\n     princes and Freemasons ... but I shrink from the thought, vengeance\r\n     will not carry me so far....[590]\r\n\r\nWe have now seen enough of the aims and methods of the Illuminati and\r\nthe true characters of their leaders from their own admissions. To make\r\nthe case complete it would be necessary also to give a résumé of the\r\nconfessions made by the ex-Illuminati, the four professors Cosandey,\r\nGrünberger, Utzschneider, and Renner, as also of the further published\r\nworks of the Illuminati--but space and time forbid. What is needed is a\r\ncomplete book on the subject, consisting of translations of the most\r\nimportant passages in all the contemporary German publications.\r\n\r\nFrom the extracts given above, can it, however, be seriously contended\r\nthat Barruel or Robison exaggerated the guilt of the Order? Do my\r\nliteral translations differ materially in sense from the translations\r\nand occasional paraphrases given by the much-abused couple?\r\n\r\nEven those contemporaries, Mounier and the member of the Illuminati[591]\r\nwho set out to refute Barruel and Lombard de Langres, merely provide\r\nfurther confirmation of their views. Thus Mounier is obliged to confess\r\nthat the real design of Illuminism was \"to undermine all civil order,\"[592]\r\nand \"Ancien Illuminé\" asserts in language no less forcible than\r\nBarruel's own that Weishaupt \"made a code of Machiavellism,\" that his\r\nmethod was \"a profound perversity, flattering everything that was base\r\nand rancorous in human nature in order to arrive at his ends,\" that he\r\nwas not inspired by \"a wise spirit of reform\" but by a \"fanatical enmity\r\ninimical to all authority on earth.\" The only essential points on which\r\nthe opposing parties differ is that whilst Mounier and \"Ancien Illuminé\"\r\ndeny the influence of the Illuminati on the French Revolution and\r\nmaintain that they ceased to exist in 1786, Barruel and Lombard de\r\nLangres present them as the inspirers of the Jacobins and declare them\r\nto be still active after the Revolution had ended. That on this point,\r\nat any rate, the latter were right, we shall see in a further chapter.\r\n\r\nThe great question that presents itself after studying the writings of\r\nthe Illuminati is: what was the motive power behind the Order? If we\r\nadmit the possibility that Frederick the Great and the Stricte\r\nObservance, working through an inner circle of Freemasons at the Lodge\r\nSt. Theodore, may have provided the first impetus and that Kölmer\r\ninitiated Weishaupt into Oriental methods of organization, the source of\r\ninspiration from which Weishaupt subsequently drew his anarchic\r\nphilosophy still remains obscure. It has frequently been suggested that\r\nhis real inspirers were Jews, and the Jewish writer Bernard Lazare\r\ndefinitely states that \"there were Jews, Cabalistic Jews, around\r\nWeishaupt.\"[593] A writer in _La Vieille France_ went so far as to\r\ndesignate these Jews as Moses Mendelssohn, Wessely, and the bankers\r\nItzig, Friedlander, and Meyer. But no documentary evidence has ever been\r\nproduced in support of these statements. It is therefore necessary to\r\nexamine them in the light of probability.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have already shown, the theosophical ideas of the Cabala play\r\nno part in the system of Illuminism; the only trace of Cabalism to be\r\nfound amongst the papers of the Order is a list of recipes for procuring\r\nabortion, for making aphrodisiacs, Aqua Toffana, pestilential vapours,\r\netc., headed \"Cabala Major.\"[594] It is possible, then, that the\r\nIlluminati may have learnt something of \"venefic magic\" and the use of\r\ncertain natural substances from Jewish Cabalists; at the same time Jews\r\nappear to have been only in rare cases admitted to the Order. Everything\r\nindeed tends to prove that Weishaupt and his first coadjutors, Zwack and\r\nMassenhausen, were pure Germans. Nevertheless there is between the\r\nideas of Weishaupt and of Lessing's \"Falk\" a distinct resemblance; both\r\nin the writings of the Illuminati and in Lessing's _Dialogues_ we find\r\nthe same vein of irony with regard to Freemasonry, the same design that\r\nit should be replaced by a more effectual system,[595]the same\r\ndenunciations of the existing social order and of bourgeois society, the\r\nsame theory that \"men should be self-governing,\" the same plan of\r\nobliterating all distinctions between nations, even the same simile of\r\nthe bee-hive as applied to human life[596] which, as I have shown\r\nelsewhere, was later on adopted by the anarchist Proudhon. It may,\r\nhowever, legitimately be urged that these ideas were those of the inner\r\nmasonic circle to which both Lessing and Weishaupt belonged, and that,\r\nthough placed in the mouth of Falk, they were in no sense Judaic.\r\n\r\nBut Lessing was also the friend and admirer of Moses Mendelssohn, who\r\nhas been suggested as one of Weishaupt's inspirers. Now, at first sight\r\nnothing seems more improbable than that an orthodox Jew such as\r\nMendelssohn should have accorded any sympathy to the anarchic scheme of\r\nWeishaupt. Nevertheless, certain of Weishaupt's doctrines are not\r\nincompatible with the principles of orthodox Judaism. Thus, for example,\r\nWeishaupt's theory--so strangely at variance with his denunciations of\r\nthe family system--that as a result of Illuminism \"the head of every\r\nfamily will be what Abraham was, the patriarch, the priest, and the\r\nunfettered lord of his family, and Reason will be the only code of\r\nMan,\"[597] is essentially a Jewish conception.\r\n\r\nIt will be objected that the patriarchal system as conceived by orthodox\r\nJews could by no means include the religion of Reason as advocated by\r\nWeishaupt. It must not, however, be forgotten that to the Jewish mind\r\nthe human race presents a dual aspect, being divided into two distinct\r\ncategories--the privileged race to whom the promises of God were made,\r\nand the great mass of humanity which remains outside the pale. Whilst\r\nstrict adherence to the commands of the Talmud and the laws of Moses is\r\nexpected of the former, the most indefinite of religious creeds suffices\r\nfor the nations excluded from the privileges that Jewish birth confers.\r\nIt was thus that Moses Mendelssohn wrote to the pastor Lavater, who had\r\nsought to win him over to Christianity:\r\n\r\n     Pursuant to the principles of my religion, I am not to seek to\r\n     convert anyone who is not born according to our laws. This\r\n     proneness to conversion, the origin of which some would fain tack\r\n     on to the Jewish religion, is, nevertheless, diametrically opposed\r\n     to it. Our rabbis unanimously teach that the written and oral laws\r\n     which form conjointly our revealed religion are obligatory on our\r\n     nation only. \"Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the\r\n     congregation of Jacob.\" We believe that all other nations of the\r\n     earth have been directed by God to adhere to the laws of nature,\r\n     and to the religion of the patriarchs. Those who regulate their\r\n     lives according to the precepts of this _religion of nature and of\r\n     reason_[598] are called virtuous men of other nations and are the\r\n     children of eternal salvation.[599] Our rabbis are so remote from\r\n     Proselytomania, that they enjoin us to dissuade, by forcible\r\n     remonstrances, everyone who comes forward to be converted. (The\r\n     Talmud says ... \"proselytes are annoying to Israel like a\r\n     scab.\")[600]\r\n\r\nBut was not this \"religion of nature and of reason\" the precise\r\nconception of Weishaupt?\r\n\r\nWhether, then, Weishaupt was directly inspired by Mendelssohn or any\r\nother Jew must remain for the present an open question. But the Jewish\r\nconnexions of certain other Illuminati cannot be disputed. The most\r\nimportant of these was Mirabeau, who arrived in Berlin just after the\r\ndeath of Mendelssohn and was welcomed by his disciples in the Jewish\r\nsalon of Henrietta Herz. It was these Jews, \"ardent supporters of the\r\nFrench Revolution\"[601] at its outset, who prevailed on Mirabeau to\r\nwrite his great apology for their race under the form of a panegyric of\r\nMendelssohn.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I do not so far see in Illuminism a Jewish conspiracy to\r\ndestroy Christianity, but rather a movement finding its principal\r\ndynamic force in the ancient spirit of revolt against the existing\r\nsocial and moral order, aided and abetted perhaps by Jews who saw in it\r\na system that might be turned to their own advantage. Meanwhile,\r\nIlluminism made use of every other movement that could serve its\r\npurpose. As the contemporary de Luchet has expressed it:\r\n\r\n     The system of the Illuminés is not to embrace the dogmas of a sect,\r\n     but to turn all errors to its advantage, to concentrate in itself\r\n     everything that men have invented in the way of duplicity and\r\n     imposture.\r\n\r\nMore than this, Illuminism was not only the assemblage of all errors, of\r\nall ruses, of all subtleties of a theoretic kind, it was also an\r\nassemblage of all practical methods for rousing men to action. For in\r\nthe words of von Hammer on the Assassins, that cannot be too often\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n     Opinions are powerless so long as they only confuse the brain\r\n     without arming the hand. Scepticism and free-thinking as long as\r\n     they occupied only the minds of the indolent and philosophical have\r\n     caused the ruin of no throne.... It is nothing to the ambitious man\r\n     what people believe, but it is everything to know how he may turn\r\n     them for the execution of his projects.\r\n\r\nThis was what Weishaupt so admirably understood; he knew how to take\r\nfrom every association, past and present, the portions he required and\r\nto weld them all into a working system of terrible efficiency--the\r\ndisintegrating doctrines of the Gnostics and Manicheans, of the modern\r\nphilosophers and Encyclopædists, the methods of the Ismailis and the\r\nAssassins, the discipline of the Jesuits and Templars, the organization\r\nand secrecy of the Freemasons, the philosophy of Machiavelli, the\r\nmystery of the Rosicrucians--he knew moreover, how to enlist the right\r\nelements in all existing associations as well as isolated individuals\r\nand turn them to his purpose. So in the army of the Illuminati we find\r\nmen of every shade of thought, from the poet Goethe[602] to the meanest\r\nintriguer--lofty idealists, social reformers, visionaries, and at the\r\nsame time the ambitious, the rancorous, and the disgruntled, men swayed\r\nby lust or embittered by grievances, all these differing in their aims\r\nyet by Weishaupt's admirable system of watertight compartments precluded\r\nfrom a knowledge of these differences and all marching, unconsciously or\r\nnot, towards the same goal.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was not the invention of Weishaupt but had been\r\nforeshadowed many centuries earlier in the East, it was Weishaupt, so\r\nfar as we know, who reduced it to a working system for the West--a\r\nsystem which has been adhered to by succeeding groups of\r\nworld-revolutionaries up to the present day. It is for this reason that\r\nI have quoted at length the writings of the Illuminati--all the ruses,\r\nall the hypocrisy, all the subtle methods of camouflage which\r\ncharacterized the Order will be found again in the insidious propaganda\r\nboth of the modern secret societies and the open revolutionary\r\norganizations whose object is to subvert all order, all morality, and\r\nall religion.\r\n\r\nI maintain, therefore, with greater conviction than ever the importance\r\nof Illuminism in the history of world-revolution. But for this\r\nco-ordination of methods the philosophers and Encyclopædists might have\r\ngone on for ever inveighing against thrones and altars, the Martinistes\r\nevoking spirits, the magicians weaving spells, the Freemasons declaiming\r\non universal brotherhood--none of these would have \"armed the hand\" and\r\ndriven the infuriated mobs into the streets of Paris; it was not until\r\nthe emissaries of Weishaupt formed an alliance with the Orléaniste\r\nleaders that vague subversive theory became active revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMAX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Masonic body with which the Illuminati formed an alliance was\r\nthe Stricte Observance, to which the Illuminati Knigge and Bode both\r\nbelonged. Cagliostro had also been initiated into the Stricte Observance\r\nnear Frankfurt and was now employed as agent of the combined order.\r\nAccording to his own confession his mission \"was to work so as to turn\r\nFreemasonry in the direction of Weishaupt's projects\"; and the funds he\r\ndrew upon were those of the Illuminati.[603] Cagliostro also formed a\r\nlink with the Martinistes, whose doctrines, though derided by Weishaupt,\r\nwere useful to his plan in attracting by their mystical character those\r\nwho would have been repelled by the cynicism of the Illuminati.\r\nAccording to Barruel, it was the Martinistes who--following in the\r\nfootsteps of the Rosicrucians--had suggested to Weishaupt the device of\r\npresenting Christ as an \"Illuminatus\" which had led to such triumphant\r\nresults amongst the Protestant clergy.\r\n\r\nBut if Weishaupt made use of the various masonic associations, they on\r\ntheir account found in him a valuable ally. The fact is that by this\r\ntime both French and German Freemasons were very much at sea with regard\r\nto the whole subject of Masonry and needed someone to give a point to\r\ntheir deliberations. Thus at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad convened on\r\nJuly 16, 1782, and attended by representatives of masonic bodies from\r\nall over the world, the first question propounded by the Grand Master of\r\nthe Templars (i.e. the Stricte Observance) was: \"_What is the real\r\nobject of the Order and its true origin_?\" So, says Mirabeau in relating\r\nthis incident, \"this same Grand Master and all his assistants had worked\r\nfor more than twenty years with incredible ardour at a thing of which\r\nthey knew neither the real object nor the origin.\"[604]\r\n\r\nTwo years later the Freemasons of France do not appear to have been any\r\nless in the dark on this matter, for we find them writing to General\r\nRainsford, one of the English Masons who had been present at the\r\nCongress of Wilhelmsbad, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Since you say that Masonry has never experienced any variation in\r\n     its aim, do you then know with certainty what this unique object\r\n     is? Is it useful for the happiness of mankind?... Tell us if it is\r\n     of an historical, political, hermetical, or scientific nature?...\r\n     Moral, social, or religious?... Are the traditions oral or\r\n     written?[605]\r\n\r\nBut Weishaupt had a very definite object in view, which was to gain\r\ncontrol of all Freemasonry, and though he himself was not present at the\r\nCongress, his coadjutor Knigge, who had been travelling about Germany\r\nproclaiming himself the reformer of Freemasonry, presented himself at\r\nWilhelmsbad, armed with full authority from Weishaupt, and succeeded in\r\nenrolling a number of magistrates, savants, ecclesiastics, and ministers\r\nof state as Illuminati and in allying himself with the deputies of\r\nSaint-Martin and Willermoz. Vanquished by this powerful rival, the\r\nStricte Observance ceased temporarily to exist and Illuminism was left\r\nin possession of the field.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1785, a further congress took place in Paris, convened\r\nthis time by the Philalèthes, at which the Illuminati Bode (alias\r\nAmelius) and the Baron de Busche (alias Bayard) were present, also--it\r\nhas been stated--the \"magician\" Cagliostro, the magnetiser Mesmer, the\r\nCabalist Duchanteau, and of course the leaders of the Philalèthes,\r\nSavalette de Langes, who was elected President, the Marquis de\r\nChefdebien, and a number of German members of the same Order. This\r\ncongress led to no very practical results, and a further and more secret\r\none was convened in the following year at Frankfurt, where a Grand Lodge\r\nhad been established in 1783. It was here that the deaths of Louis XVI\r\nand Gustavus III of Sweden are said to have been decreed.\r\n\r\nBut already in this same year of 1785 the first act of the revolutionary\r\ndrama had been played out. The famous \"Affair of the Necklace\" can never\r\nbe understood in the pages of official history; only an examination of\r\nthe mechanism provided by the secret societies can explain that\r\nextraordinary episode, which, in the opinion of Napoleon, contributed\r\nmore than any other cause to the explosion of 1789. In its double attack\r\non Church and Monarchy the Affair of the Necklace fulfilled the purpose\r\nof both Frederick the Great and of the Illuminati. Cagliostro, we know,\r\nreceived both money and instructions from the Order for carrying out the\r\nplot, and after it had ended in his own and the Cardinal de Rohan's\r\nexoneration and exile, we find him embarking on fresh secret-society\r\nwork in London, where he arrived in November of the same year.\r\nAnnouncing himself as the Count Sutkowski, member of a society at\r\nAvignon, he \"visited the Swedenborgians at their Theosophical Society\r\nmeeting in rooms in the Middle Temple and displayed minute acquaintance\r\nwith their doctrines, whilst claiming a superior knowledge.\"[606]\r\nAccording to a generally received opinion, Cagliostro was the author of\r\na mysterious proclamation which appeared at this moment in the _Morning\r\nHerald_ in the cypher of the Rose-Croix.[607]\r\n\r\nBut in the year before these events an extraordinary thing had happened.\r\nAn evangelist preacher and Illuminatus named Lanze had been sent in July\r\n1785 as an emissary of the Illuminati to Silesia, but on his journey he\r\nwas struck down by lightning. The instructions of the Order were found\r\non him, and as a result its intrigues were conclusively revealed to the\r\nGovernment of Bavaria.[608] A searching enquiry followed, the houses of\r\nZwack and Bassus were raided, and it was then that the documents and\r\nother incriminating evidence referred to in the preceding chapter of\r\nthis book were seized and made public under the name of _The Original\r\nWritings of the Order of the Illuminati_ (1787). But before this the\r\nevidence of four ex-Illuminati, professors of Munich, was published in\r\ntwo separate volumes.[609]\r\n\r\nThe diabolical nature of Illuminism now remained no longer a matter of\r\ndoubt, and the Order was officially suppressed. The opponents of Barruel\r\nand Robison therefore declare that Illuminism came finally to an end. We\r\nshall see later by documentary evidence that it never ceased to exist,\r\nand that twenty-five years later not only the Illuminati but Weishaupt\r\nhimself were still as active as ever behind the scenes in Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nBut for the present we must follow its course from the moment of its\r\napparent extinction in 1786. This course can be traced not only through\r\nthe \"German Union,\" which is believed to have been a reorganization of\r\nthe original Illuminati, but through the secret societies of France.\r\nIlluminism in reality is less an Order than a principle, and a principle\r\nwhich can work better under cover of something else. Weishaupt himself\r\nhad laid down the precept that the work of Illuminism could best be\r\nconducted \"under other names and other occupations,\" and henceforth we\r\nshall always find it carried on by this skilful system of camouflage.\r\n\r\nThe first cover adopted was the lodge of the \"Amis Réunis\" in Paris,\r\nwith which, as we have already seen, the Illuminati had established\r\nrelations. But now in 1787 a definite alliance was effected by the\r\naforementioned Illuminati, Bode and Busche, who in response to an\r\ninvitation from the secret committee of the lodge arrived in Paris in\r\nFebruary of this year. Here they found the old Illuminatus Mirabeau--who\r\nwith Talleyrand had been largely instrumental in summoning these German\r\nBrothers--and, according to Gustave Bord,[610] two important members of\r\nthe Stricte Observance, the Marquis de Chefdebien d'Armisson (_Eques a\r\nCapite Galeato_) and an Austrian, the Comte Leopold de\r\nKollowrath-Krakowski (_Eques ab Aquila Fulgente_) who also belonged to\r\nWeishaupt's Order of Illuminati in which he bore the pseudonym of\r\nNumenius.\r\n\r\nIt is important here to recognize the peculiar part played by the Lodge\r\nof the _Amis Réunis_. Whilst the _Loge des Neuf Soeurs_ was largely\r\ncomposed of middle-class revolutionaries such as Brissot, Danton,\r\nCamille Desmoulins, and Champfort, and the _Loge de la Candeur_ of\r\naristocratic revolutionaries--Lafayette as well as the Orléanistes, the\r\nMarquis de Sillery, the Duc d'Aiguillon, the Marquis de Custine, and the\r\nLameths--_the Loge du Contrat Social_ was mainly composed of honest\r\nvisionaries who entertained no revolutionary projects but, according to\r\nBarruel, were strongly Royalist. The rôle of the \"Amis Réunis\" was to\r\ncollect together the subversives from all other lodges--Philalèthes,\r\nRose-Croix, members of the _Loge des Neuf Sours_ and of the _Loge de la\r\nCandeur_ and of the most secret committees of the Grand Orient, as well\r\nas deputies from the _Illuminés_ in the provinces. Here, then, at the\r\nlodge in the Rue de la Sordière, under the direction of Savalette de\r\nLanges, were to be found the disciples of Weishaupt, of Swedenborg, and\r\nof Saint-Martin, as well as the practical makers of revolution--the\r\nagitators and demagogues of 1789.\r\n\r\nThe influence of German Illuminism on all these heterogeneous elements\r\nwas enormous. From this moment, says a further Bavarian report of the\r\nmatter, a complete change took place in the Order of the \"Amis Réunis.\"\r\nHitherto only vaguely subversive, the Chevaliers Bienfaisants became the\r\nChevaliers Malfaisants, the Amis Réunis became the Ennemis Réunis. The\r\narrival of the two Germans, Bode and Busche, gave the finishing touch to\r\nthe conspiracy. \"The avowed object of their journey was to obtain\r\ninformation about magnetism, which was just then making a great stir,\"\r\nbut in reality, \"taken up with the gigantic plan of their Order,\" their\r\nreal aim was to make proselytes. It will be seen that the following\r\npassage exactly confirms the account given by Barruel:\r\n\r\n     As the Lodge of the _Amis Réunis_ collected together everything\r\n     that could be found out from all other masonic systems in the\r\n     world, so the way was soon paved there for Illuminism. It was also\r\n     not long before this lodge together with all those that depended on\r\n     it was impregnated with Illuminism. The former system of all these\r\n     was as if wiped out, so that from this time onwards the framework\r\n     of the Philalèthes quite disappeared and in the place of the former\r\n     Cabalistic-magical extravagance [_Schwärmerei_] came in the\r\n     philosophical-political.[611]\r\n\r\nIt was therefore not Martinism, Cabalism, or Freemasonry that in\r\nthemselves provided the real revolutionary force. Many non-illuminized\r\nFreemasons, as Barruel himself declares, remained loyal to the throne\r\nand altar, and as soon as the monarchy was seen to be in danger the\r\nRoyalist Brothers of the _Contrat Social_ boldly summoned the lodges to\r\ncoalesce in defence of King and Constitution; even some of the upper\r\nMasons, who in the degree of Knight Kadosch had sworn hatred to the Pope\r\nand Bourbon monarchy, rallied likewise to the royal cause. \"The French\r\nspirit triumphed over the masonic spirit in the greater number of the\r\nBrothers. Opinions as well as hearts were still for the King.\" It\r\nneeded the devastating doctrines of Weishaupt to undermine this spirit\r\nand to turn the \"degrees of vengeance\" from vain ceremonial into\r\nterrible fact.\r\n\r\nIf, then, it is said that the Revolution was prepared in the lodges of\r\nFreemasons--and many French Masons have boasted of the fact--let it\r\nalways be added that it was _Illuminized Freemasonry_ that made the\r\nRevolution, and that the Masons who acclaim it are illuminized Masons,\r\ninheritors of the same tradition introduced into the lodges of France in\r\n1787 by the disciples of Weishaupt, \"patriarch of the Jacobins.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the Freemasons of France in 1787 were thus not conscious allies\r\nof the Illuminati. According to Cadet de Gassicourt, there were in all\r\nthe lodges only twenty-seven real initiates; the rest were largely dupes\r\nwho knew little or nothing of the source whence the fresh influence\r\namong them derived. The amazing feature of the whole situation is that\r\nthe most enthusiastic supporters of the movement were men belonging to\r\nthe upper classes and even to the royal families of Europe. A\r\ncontemporary relates that no less than thirty princes--reigning and\r\nnon-reigning--had taken under their protection a confederation from\r\nwhich they stood to lose everything and had become so imbued by its\r\nprinciples that they were inaccessible to reason.[612] Intoxicated by\r\nthe flattery lavished on them by the priests of Illuminism, they adopted\r\na religion of which they understood nothing. Weishaupt, of course, had\r\ntaken care that none of these royal dupes should be initiated into the\r\nreal aims of the Order, and at first adhered to the original plan of\r\nexcluding them altogether; but the value of their co-operation soon\r\nbecame apparent and by a supreme irony it was with a Grand Duke that he\r\nhimself took refuge.\r\n\r\nBut if the great majority of princes and nobles were stricken with\r\nblindness at this crisis, a few far-seeing spirits recognized the danger\r\nand warned the world of the impending disaster. In 1787 Cardinal\r\nCaprara, Apostolic Nuncio at Vienna, addressed a confidential memoir to\r\nthe Pope, in which he pointed out that the activities carried on in\r\nGermany by the different sects of Illuminés, of Perfectibilists, of\r\nFreemasons, etc., were increasing.\r\n\r\n     The danger is approaching, for from all these senseless dreams of\r\n     Illuminism, of Swedenborgianism, or of Freemasonry a frightful\r\n     reality will emerge. Visionaries have their time; the revolution\r\n     they forebode will have its time also.[613]\r\n\r\nA more amazing prophecy, however, was the _Essai sur la Secte des\r\nIlluminés_, by the Marquis de Luchet,[614] a Liberal noble who played\r\nsome part in the revolutionary movement, yet who nevertheless realized\r\nthe dangers of Illuminism. Thus, as early as 1789, before the Revolution\r\nhad really developed, de Luchet uttered these words of warning:\r\n\r\n     Deluded people ... learn that there exists a conspiracy in favour\r\n     of despotism against liberty, of incapacity against talent, of vice\r\n     against virtue, of ignorance against enlightenment.... This society\r\n     aims at governing the world.... Its object is universal domination.\r\n     This plan may seem extraordinary, incredible--yes, but not\r\n     chimerical ... no such calamity has ever yet afflicted the world.\r\n\r\nDe Luchet then goes on to foretell precisely the events that were to\r\ntake place three and four years later; he describes the position of a\r\nking who has to recognize masters above himself and to authorize their\r\n\"abominable régime,\" to become the plaything of an ambitious and\r\nfanatical horde which has taken possession of his will.\r\n\r\n     See him condemned to serve the passions of all that surround him\r\n     ... to raise degraded men to power, to prostitute his judgement by\r\n     choices that dishonour his prudence....\r\n\r\nAll this was exactly fulfilled during the reign of the Girondin ministry\r\nof 1792. The campaign of destruction carried out in the summer of 1793\r\nis thus foretold:\r\n\r\n     We do not mean to say that the country where the Illuminés reign\r\n     will cease to exist, but it will fall into such a degree of\r\n     humiliation that it will no longer count in politics, that the\r\n     population will diminish, that the inhabitants who resist the\r\n     inclination to pass into a foreign land will no longer enjoy the\r\n     happiness of consideration, nor the charms of society, nor the\r\n     gifts of commerce.\r\n\r\nAnd de Luchet ends with this despairing appeal to the powers of Europe:\r\n\r\n     Masters of the world, cast your eyes on a desolated multitude,\r\n     listen to their cries, their tears, their hopes. A mother asks you\r\n     to restore her son, a wife her husband, your cities for the fine\r\n     arts that have fled from them, the country for citizens, the fields\r\n     for cultivators, religion for forms of worship, and Nature for\r\n     beings of which she is worthy.\r\n\r\nFive years after these words were written the countryside of France was\r\ndesolate, art and commerce were destroyed, and women following the\r\ntumbril that carried Fouquier-Tinville to the guillotine cried out:\r\n\"Give me back my brother, my son, my husband!\" So was this amazing\r\nprophecy fulfilled. Yet not one word has history to say on the subject!\r\nThe warning of de Luchet has fallen on deaf ears amongst posterity as\r\namongst the men of his own day.\r\n\r\nDe Luchet himself recognizes the obstacle to his obtaining a hearing:\r\nthere are too many \"passions interested in supporting the system of the\r\nIlluminés,\" too many deluded rulers imagining themselves enlightened\r\nready to precipitate their people into the abyss, whilst \"the heads of\r\nthe Order will never relinquish the authority they have acquired nor the\r\ntreasure at their disposal.\" In vain de Luchet appeals to the Freemasons\r\nto save their Order from the invading sect. \"Would it not be possible,\"\r\nhe asks, \"to direct the Freemasons themselves against the Illuminés by\r\nshowing them that whilst they are working to maintain harmony in\r\nsociety, those others are everywhere sowing seeds of discord\" and\r\npreparing the ultimate destruction of their Order? So far it is not too\r\nlate; if only men will believe in the danger it may be averted: \"from\r\nthe moment they are convinced, the necessary blow is dealt to the sect.\"\r\nOtherwise de Luchet prophesies \"a series of calamities of which the end\r\nis lost in the darkness of time, ... a subterranean fire smouldering\r\neternally and breaking forth periodically in violent and devastating\r\nexplosions.\" What words could better describe the history of the last\r\n150 years?\r\n\r\nThe _Essai sur la Sects des Illuminés_ is one of the most extraordinary\r\ndocuments of history and at the same time one of the most mysterious.\r\nWhy it should have been written by the Marquis de Luchet, who is said to\r\nhave collaborated with Mirabeau in the _Galerie de Portraits_ published\r\nin the following year, why it should have been appended to Mirabeau's\r\n_Histoire Secrète de la Cour de Berlin_, and accordingly attributed to\r\nMirabeau himself, why Barruel should have denounced it as dust thrown in\r\nthe eyes of the public, although it entirely corroborated his own point\r\nof view, are questions to which I can find no reply. That is was written\r\nseriously and in all good faith it is impossible to doubt; whilst the\r\nfact that it appeared before, instead of after, the events described,\r\nrenders it even more valuable evidence of the reality of the conspiracy\r\nthan Barruel's own admirable work. What Barruel saw, de Luchet foresaw\r\nwith equal clearness. As to the rôle of Mirabeau at this crisis, we can\r\nonly hazard an explanation on the score of his habitual inconsistency.\r\nAt one moment he was seeking interviews with the King's ministers in\r\norder to warn them of the coming danger, at the next he was\r\nenergetically stirring up insurrection. It is therefore not impossible\r\nthat he may have encouraged de Luchet's exposure of the conspiracy,\r\nalthough meanwhile he himself had entered into the scheme of\r\ndestruction. Indeed, according to a pamphlet published in 1791 entitled\r\n_Mystères de la Conspiration_,[615] the whole plan of revolution was\r\nfound amongst his papers. The editor of this _brochure_ explains that\r\nthe document here made public, called _Croquis ou Projet de Révolution\r\nde Monsieur de Mirabeau_, was seized at the house of Madame Lejai, the\r\nwife of Mirabeau's publisher, on October 6, 1789. Beginning with a\r\ndiatribe against the French monarchy, the document goes on to say that\r\n\"in order to triumph over this hydra-headed monster these are my ideas\":\r\n\r\n     We must overthrow all order, suppress all laws, annul all power,\r\n     and leave the people in anarchy. The laws we establish will not\r\n     perhaps be in force at once, but at any rate, having given back the\r\n     power to the people, they will resist for the sake of their liberty\r\n     which they will believe they are preserving. We must caress their\r\n     vanity, flatter their hopes, promise them happiness after our work\r\n     has been in operation; we must elude their caprices and their\r\n     systems at will, for the people as legislators are very dangerous,\r\n     they only establish laws which coincide with their passions, their\r\n     want of knowledge would besides only give birth to abuses. But as\r\n     the people are a lever which legislators can move at their will, we\r\n     must necessarily use them as a support, and render hateful to them\r\n     everything we wish to destroy and sow illusions in their path; we\r\n     must also buy all the mercenary pens which propagate our methods\r\n     and which will instruct the people concerning their enemies whom we\r\n     attack. The clergy, being the most powerful through public opinion,\r\n     can only be destroyed by ridiculing religion, rendering its\r\n     ministers odious, and only representing them as hypocritical\r\n     monsters, for Mahomet in order to establish his religion first\r\n     defamed the paganism which the Arabs, the Sarmathes, and the\r\n     Scythians professed. Libels must at every moment show fresh traces\r\n     of hatred against the clergy. To exaggerate their riches, to make\r\n     the sins of an individual appear to be common to all, to attribute\r\n     to them all vices; calumny, murder, irreligion, sacrilege, all is\r\n     permitted in times of revolution.\r\n\r\n     We must degrade the _noblesse_ and attribute it to an odious\r\n     origin, establish a germ of equality which can never exist but\r\n     which will flatter the people; [we must] immolate the most\r\n     obstinate, burn and destroy their property in order to intimidate\r\n     the rest, so that if we cannot entirely destroy this prejudice we\r\n     can weaken it and the people will avenge their vanity and their\r\n     jealousy by all the excesses which will bring them to submission.\r\n\r\nAfter describing how the soldiers are to be seduced from their\r\nallegiance, and the magistrates represented to the people as despots,\r\n\"since the people, brutal and ignorant, only see the evil and never the\r\ngood of things,\" the writer explains they must be given only limited\r\npower in the municipalities.\r\n\r\n     Let us beware above all of giving them too much force; their\r\n     despotism is too dangerous, we must flatter the people by\r\n     gratuitous justice, promise them a great diminution in taxes and a\r\n     more equal division, more extension in fortunes, and less\r\n     humiliation. These phantasies [_vertiges_] will fanaticise the\r\n     people, who will flatten out all resistance. What matter the\r\n     victims and their numbers? spoliations, destructions, burnings, and\r\n     all the necessary effects of a revolution? nothing must be sacred\r\n     and we can say with Machiavelli: \"What matter the means as long as\r\n     one arrives at the end?\"\r\n\r\nWere all these the ideas of Mirabeau, or were they, like the other\r\ndocument of the Illuminati found amongst his papers, the programme of a\r\nconspiracy? I incline to the latter theory. The plan of campaign was, at\r\nany rate, the one followed out by the conspirators, as Chamfort, the\r\nfriend and confidant of Mirabeau, admitted in his conversation with\r\nMarmontel:\r\n\r\n     The nation is a great herd that only thinks of browsing, and with\r\n     good sheepdogs the shepherds can lead it as they please.... Money\r\n     and the hope of plunder are all-powerful with the people....\r\n     Mirabeau cheerfully asserts that with 100 louis one can make quite\r\n     a good riot.[616]\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary thus describes the methods of the leaders:\r\n\r\n     Mirabeau, in the exuberance of an orgy, cried one day: \"That\r\n     _canaille_ well deserves to have us for legislators!\" These\r\n     professions of faith, as we see, are not at all democratic; the\r\n     sect uses the populace as revolution fodder [_chair à révolution_],\r\n     as prime material for brigandage, after which it seizes the gold\r\n     and abandons generations to torture. It is veritably the code of\r\n     hell.[617]\r\n\r\nIt is this \"code of hell\" set forth in the \"Projet de Révolution\" that\r\nwe shall find repeated in succeeding documents throughout the last\r\nhundred years--in the correspondence of the \"Alta Vendita,\" in the\r\n_Dialogues aux Enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu_ by Maurice Joly,\r\nin the Revolutionary Catechism of Bakunin, in the Protocols of the\r\nElders of Zion, and in the writings of the Russian Bolsheviks to-day.\r\n\r\nWhatever doubts may be cast on the authenticity of any of these\r\ndocuments, the indisputable fact thus remains that as early as 1789 this\r\nMachiavellian plan of engineering revolution and using the people as a\r\nlever for raising a tyrannical minority to power, had been formulated;\r\nfurther, that the methods described in this earliest \"Protocol\" have\r\nbeen carried out according to plan from that day to this. And in every\r\noutbreak of the social revolution the authors of the movement have been\r\nknown to be connected with secret societies.\r\n\r\nIt was Adrien Duport, author of the \"Great Fear\" that spread over France\r\non July 22, 1789, Duport, the inner initiate of the secret societies,\r\n\"holding in his hands all the threads of the masonic conspiracy,\" who on\r\nMay 21, 1790, set forth before the Committee of Propaganda the vast\r\nscheme of destruction.\r\n\r\n     M. de Mirabeau has well established the fact that the fortunate\r\n     revolution which has taken place in France must and will be for all\r\n     the peoples of Europe the awakening of liberty and for Kings the\r\n     sleep of death.\r\n\r\nBut Duport goes on to explain that whilst Mirabeau thinks it advisable\r\nat present not to concern themselves with anything outside France, he\r\nhimself believes that the triumph of the French Revolution must lead\r\ninevitably to \"the ruin of all thrones ... Therefore we must hasten\r\namong our neighbours the same revolution that is going on in France.\"[618]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan of illuminized Freemasonry was thus nothing less than\r\nworld-revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to reply to a critic who suggested that in\r\nemphasizing the rôle of the secret societies in _World Revolution_ I had\r\nabandoned my former thesis of the Orléaniste conspiracy. I wish\r\ntherefore to state that I do not retract one word I wrote in _The French\r\nRevolution_ on the Orléaniste conspiracy, I merely supply a further\r\nexplanation of its efficiency by enlarging on the aid it received from\r\nthe party I referred to as the Subversives--outcome of the masonic\r\nlodges. It was because the Orléanistes held the whole masonic\r\norganization at their disposal that they were able to carry out their\r\nplans with such extraordinary skill and thoroughness, and because they\r\nhad at their back men bent solely on destruction that they could enlist\r\na following which would not have rallied to a mere scheme of usurpation.\r\nEven Montjoie, who saw in the Revolution principally the work of the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, indicates in a very curious passage of a later work the\r\nexistence of the still darker intrigue behind the conspiracy he had\r\nspent his energies in unveiling:\r\n\r\n     I will not examine whether this wicked prince, thinking he was\r\n     acting in his personal interests, was not moved by that invisible\r\n     hand which seems to have created all the events of our revolution\r\n     in order to lead us towards a goal that we do not see at present,\r\n     but which I think we shall see before long.[619]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after this mysterious utterance Montjoie never again\r\nreturns to the subject.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Revolution, Orléanism and Freemasonry thus\r\nformed a united body. According to Lombard de Langres:\r\n\r\n     France in 1789 counted more than 2,000 lodges affiliated to the\r\n     Grand Orient; the number of adepts was more than 100,000. The first\r\n     events of 1789 were only Masonry in action. All the revolutionaries\r\n     of the Constituent Assembly were initiated into the third degree.\r\n     We place in this class the Duc d'Orléans, Valence, Syllery, Laclos,\r\n     Sièyes, Pétion, Menou, Biron, Montesquieu, Fauchet, Condorcet,\r\n     Lafayette, Mirabeau, Garat, Rabaud, Dubois-Crancé, Thiébaud,\r\n     Larochefoucauld, and others.[620]\r\n\r\nAmongst these others were not only the Brissotins, who formed the\r\nnucleus of the Girondin party, but the men of the Terror--Marat,\r\nRobespierre, Danton, and Desmoulins.\r\n\r\nIt was these fiercer elements, true disciples of the Illuminati, who\r\nwere to sweep away the visionary Masons dreaming of equality and\r\nbrotherhood. Following the precedent set by Weishaupt, classical\r\npseudonyms were adopted by these leaders of the Jacobins, thus Chaumette\r\nwas known as Anaxagoras, Clootz as Anacharsis, Danton as Horace, Lacroix\r\nas Publicola, and Ronsin as Scaevola[621]; again, after the manner of\r\nthe Illuminati, the names of towns were changed and a revolutionary\r\ncalendar was adopted. The red cap and loose hair affected by the\r\nJacobins appear also to have been foreshadowed in the lodges of the\r\nIlluminati.[622]\r\n\r\nYet faithfully as the Terrorists carried out the plan of the Illuminati,\r\nit would seem that they themselves were not initiated into the innermost\r\nsecrets of the conspiracy. Behind the Convention, behind the clubs,\r\nbehind the Revolutionary Tribunal, there existed, says Lombard de\r\nLangres, that \"most secret convention [_convention sécrétissime_] which\r\ndirected everything after May 31, an occult and terrible power of which\r\nthe other Convention became the slave and which was composed of the\r\nprime initiates of Illuminism. This power was above Robespierre and the\r\ncommittees of the government, ... it was this occult power which\r\nappropriated to itself the treasures of the nation and distributed them\r\nto the brothers and friends who had helped on the great work.\"[623]\r\n\r\nWhat was the aim of this occult power? Was it merely the plan of\r\ndestruction that had originated in the brain of a Bavarian professor\r\ntwenty years earlier, or was it something far older, a live and terrible\r\nforce that had lain dormant through the centuries, that Weishaupt and\r\nhis allies had not created but only loosed upon the world? The Reign of\r\nTerror, like the outbreak of Satanism in the Middle Ages, can be\r\nexplained by no material causes--the orgy of hatred, lust, and cruelty\r\ndirected not only against the rich but still more against the poor and\r\ndefenceless, the destruction of science, art, and beauty, the\r\ndesecration of the churches, the organized campaign against all that was\r\nnoble, all that was sacred, all that humanity holds dear, what was this\r\nbut Satanism?\r\n\r\nIn desecrating the churches and stamping on the crucifixes the Jacobins\r\nhad in fact followed the precise formula of black magic: \"For the\r\npurpose of infernal evocation ... it is requisite ... to profane the\r\nceremonies of the religion to which one belongs and to trample its\r\nholiest symbols under foot.\"[624] It was this that formed the prelude\r\nto the \"Great Terror,\" when, to those who lived through it, it seemed\r\nthat France lay under the sway of the powers of darkness.\r\n\r\nSo in the \"great shipwreck of civilization,\" as a contemporary has\r\ndescribed it, the projects of the Cabalists, the Gnostics, and the\r\nsecret societies which for nearly eighteen centuries had sapped the\r\nfoundations of Christianity found their fulfilment. Do we not detect an\r\necho of the Toledot Yeshu in the blasphemies of the Marquis de Sade\r\nconcerning \"the Jewish slave\" and \"the adulterous woman, the courtesan\r\nof Galilee?\" And in the imprecations of Marat's worshippers, \"Christ was\r\na false prophet!\" a repetition of the secret doctrine attributed to the\r\nTemplars: \"Jesus is not the true God; He is a false prophet; He was not\r\ncrucified for the salvation of humanity, but for His own misdeeds\"? Are\r\nthese resemblances accidental, or are they the outcome of a continuous\r\nplot against the Christian faith?\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the rôle of Jews in the Revolution? In this connexion it\r\nis necessary to understand the situation of the Jews in France at this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAfter the decree of banishment issued by Charles VI in 1394, Jewry, as a\r\nbody, had ceased to exist; but towards the end of the fifteenth century\r\na certain number of Jews, driven out of Spain and Portugal, were allowed\r\nto settle in Bordeaux. These Spanish and Portuguese Jews, known as\r\n_Sephardim_, appeared to acquiesce in the Christian religion and were\r\nnot officially regarded as Jews, but enjoyed considerable privileges\r\nconferred on them by Henri II. It was not until the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, during the Regency, that Jews began to reappear in\r\nParis. Meanwhile, the annexation of Alsace at the end of the previous\r\ncentury had added to the population of France the German Jews of that\r\nprovince known as the _Ashkenazim_.\r\n\r\nIt is important to distinguish between these two races of Jews in\r\ndiscussing the question of Jewish emancipation at the time of the\r\nRevolution. For whilst the Sephardim had shown themselves good citizens\r\nand were therefore subject to no persecutions, the Ashkenazim by their\r\nextortionate usury and oppressions had made themselves detested by the\r\npeople, so that rigorous laws were enforced to restrain their rapacity.\r\nThe discussions that raged in the National Assembly on the subject of\r\nthe Jewish question related therefore mainly to the Jews of Alsace.\r\nAlready, in 1784, the Jews of Bordeaux had been accorded further\r\nconcessions by Louis XVI; in 1776 all Portuguese Jews had been given\r\nreligious liberty and the permission to inhabit all parts of the\r\nkingdom. The decree of January 28, 1790, conferring on the Jews of\r\nBordeaux the rights of French citizens, put the finishing touch to this\r\nscheme of liberation. But the proposal to extend this privilege to the\r\nJews of Alsace evoked a storm of controversy in the Assembly and also\r\nviolent insurrections amongst the Alsatian peasants. It was thus on\r\nbehalf of the people that several deputies protested against the decree.\r\n\"The Jews,\" said the Abbé Maury, \"have traversed seventeen centuries\r\nwithout mingling with other nations. They have never done anything but\r\ntrade with money, they have been the scourge of agricultural provinces,\r\nnot one of them has known how to ennoble his hands by guiding the\r\nplough.\" And he went on to point out that the Jews \"must not be\r\npersecuted, they must be protected as individuals and not as Frenchmen,\r\nsince they cannot be citizens.... Whatever you do, they will always\r\nremain foreigners in our midst.\"\r\n\r\nMonseigneur de la Fare, Bishop of Nancy, adopted the same line of\r\nargument:\r\n\r\n     They must be accorded protection, safety, liberty; but should we\r\n     admit into the family a tribe that is foreign to it, that turns its\r\n     eyes unceasingly towards a common country, that aspires to abandon\r\n     the land that bears it?... My _cahier_ orders me to protest against\r\n     the motion that has been made to you. The interest of the Jews\r\n     themselves necessitates this protest. The people have a horror of\r\n     them; they are often in Alsace the victims of popular risings.[625]\r\n\r\nIn all this, as will be seen, there is no question of persecution, but\r\nof precautions against a race that wilfully isolates itself from the\r\nrest of the community in order to pursue its own interests and\r\nadvantages. The Jews of Bordeaux indeed recognized the odium that the\r\nGerman Jews were calculated to bring on the Jewish cause, and in an\r\naddress to the Assembly on January 22, 1790, dissociated themselves from\r\nthe aggressive claims of the Ashkenazim:\r\n\r\n     We dare to believe that our condition in France would not to-day be\r\n     open to discussion if certain demands of the Jews of Alsace,\r\n     Lorraine, and the Trois Evêchés [i.e. Metz, Toul, and Verdun] had\r\n     not caused a confusion of ideas which appears to reflect on us. We\r\n     do not yet know exactly what these demands are, but to judge by the\r\n     public papers they appear to be rather extraordinary since these\r\n     Jews aspire to live in France under a special régime, to have laws\r\n     peculiar to themselves, and to constitute a class of citizens\r\n     separated from all the others.\r\n\r\n     As for us, our condition in France has long since been settled. We\r\n     have been naturalized French since 1550; we possess all kinds of\r\n     properties, and we enjoy the unlimited right to acquire estates. We\r\n     have neither laws, tribunals, nor officers of our own[626]\r\n\r\nIn adopting this attitude the Sephardim created a precedent which, if it\r\nhad been followed henceforth consistently by their co-religionists,\r\nmight have gone far to allay prejudice against the Jewish race. It was\r\nthe solidarity generally presented by the Jews towards the rest of the\r\ncommunity which excited alarm in the minds of French citizens. Thirty\r\nyears earlier the merchants of Paris, in a petition against the\r\nadmission of the Jews to their corporations, indicated by an admirable\r\nsimile the danger this solidarity offered to free commerce.\r\n\r\n     The French merchant carries on his commerce alone; each commercial\r\n     house is in a way isolated, whilst the Jews are particles of\r\n     quicksilver, which at the least slant run together into a\r\n     block.[627]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all protests, the decree emancipating the Jews of Alsace\r\nwas passed in September 1791, and hymns of praise were sung in the\r\nsynagogues.\r\n\r\nWhat part was actually played by the Jews in the tumults of the\r\nRevolution it is impossible to determine, for the reason that they are\r\nseldom designated as such in the writings of contemporaries. On this\r\npoint Jewish writers appear to be better informed than the rest of the\r\nworld, for Monsieur Léon Kahn in his panegyric on the part played by his\r\nco-religionists in the Revolution[628] finds Jews where even Drumont\r\nfailed to detect them. Thus we read that it was a Jew, Rosenthal, who\r\nheaded the legion known by his name, which was sent against La Vendée\r\nbut took to flight,[629] and which was the subject of complaint when\r\nemployed to guard the Royal Family at the Temple[630]; that amongst\r\nthose who worked most energetically to deprive the clergy of their goods\r\nwas a Jewish ex-old-clothes seller, Zalkind Hourwitz; that it was a Jew\r\nnamed Lang who murdered three out of the five Swiss guards at the foot\r\nof the staircase in the Tuileries on August 10[631]; that Jews were\r\nimplicated in the theft of the crown jewels on September 16, 1792, and\r\none named Lyre was executed in consequence; that it was Clootz and the\r\nJew Pereyra, and not, as I had stated, Hébert, Chaumette, and Momoro,\r\nwho went to the Archbishop Gobel in November 1793 and induced him by\r\nmeans of threats to abjure the Christian faith.[632]\r\n\r\nAll these facts were unknown to me when I wrote my account of these\r\nevents; it will be seen then that, far from exaggerating the rôle of the\r\nJews in _The French Revolution_, I very much underrated it. Indeed the\r\nquestion of their complicity had not occurred to me at all when I wrote\r\nthis book, and the only Jew to whom I referred was Ephraïm--sent to\r\nFrance by the Illuminati Frederick William II and Bischoffswerder--whom\r\nM. Kahn indicates as playing an even more important part than I had\r\nassigned to him.\r\n\r\nBut illuminating as these incidents may be, it is yet open to question\r\nwhether they prove any concerted attempt on the part of the Jews to\r\nbring about the overthrow of the French monarchy and the Catholic\r\nreligion. It is true, nevertheless, that they themselves boasted of\r\ntheir revolutionary ardour. In an address presenting their claims before\r\nthe National Assembly in 1789, they declare:\r\n\r\n     Regenerators of the French Empire, you would not wish that we\r\n     should cease to be citizens, since for already six months we have\r\n     assiduously performed all duties as such, and the recompense for\r\n     the zeal we have shown in accelerating the revolution will not be\r\n     to condemn us to participate in none of its advantages now that it\r\n     has been consummated.... Nosseigneurs, we are all very good\r\n     citizens, and in this memorable revolution we dare to say that\r\n     there is not one of us who has not proved himself.[633]\r\n\r\nIn all these activities, however, religious feeling appears to have\r\nplayed an entirely subordinate part; the Jews, as has been said, were\r\nfree before the Revolution to carry on the rites of their faith. And\r\nwhen the great anti-religious campaign began, many of them entered\r\nwhole-heartedly into the attack on all religious faiths, their own\r\nincluded. Thus on the 21st Brumaire, whilst the Feasts of Reason were\r\ntaking place in the churches of Paris, we find \"a deputation of\r\nIsraelites\" presenting themselves at the National Assembly and\r\n\"depositing on the bosom of the Mountain the ornaments of which they had\r\nstripped a little temple they had in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\" At the\r\nsame moment--\r\n\r\n     A revolutionary committee of the Réunion brings to the general\r\n     council crosses, suns, chalices, copes, and quantities of other\r\n     ornaments of worship, and a member of this committee observes that\r\n     several of these effects belong to individuals of the Jewish race.\r\n     A minister of the religion of Moses, Abraham, and Jacob asks in the\r\n     name of his co-religionists that the said effects should not be\r\n     regarded as belonging to such and such a sect, ... this citizen is\r\n     named Benjamin Jacob.... Another member of the same committee pays\r\n     homage to the patriotic zeal of the citizens heretofore Jews, ...\r\n     almost all have forestalled the wish of the revolutionary committee\r\n     by themselves bringing their reliquaries and ornaments, amongst\r\n     others the famous cope said to have belonged to Moses.[634]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th Frimaire at \"the Temple of Liberty,\" formerly the church of\r\nthe Benedictines, \"the citizen Alexandre Lambert _fils_, a Jew brought\r\nup in the prejudices of the Jewish religion,\" uttered a violent harangue\r\nagainst all religions:\r\n\r\n     I will prove to you, citizens, that all forms of worship are\r\n     impostures equally degrading to man and to divinities; I will not\r\n     prove it by philosophy, I do not know it, but only by the light of\r\n     reason.\r\n\r\nAfter denouncing the iniquities of both the Catholic and Protestant\r\nfaiths, Lambert demonstrates \"the absurdities of the Jewish religion,\r\nof this domineering religion\"; he thunders against Moses \"governing a\r\nsimple and agrarian people like all clever impostors,\" against \"the\r\nservile respect of the Jews for their kings ... the ablutions of women,\"\r\netc. Finally he declares:\r\n\r\n     The bad faith, citizens, of which the Jewish nation is accused does\r\n     not come from themselves but from their priests. Their religion,\r\n     which would allow them only to lend to those of their nation at 5\r\n     per cent., tells them to take all they can from Catholics; it is\r\n     even hallowed as a custom in our morning prayers to solicit God's\r\n     help in catching out a Christian. There is more, citizens, and it\r\n     is the climax of abomination: if any mistake is made in commerce\r\n     between Jews, they are ordered to make reparation; but if on 100\r\n     louis a Christian should have paid 25 too much, one is not bound to\r\n     return them to him. What an abomination! What a horror! And where\r\n     does that all come from but from the Rabbis? Who have excited\r\n     proscriptions against us? Our priests! Ah, citizens, more than\r\n     anything in the world we must abjure a religion which, ... by\r\n     subjecting us to irksome and servile practices, makes it impossible\r\n     for us to be good citizens.[635]\r\n\r\nThe encouragement accorded by the Jews to the French Revolution appears\r\nthus to have been prompted not by religious fanaticism but by a desire\r\nfor national advantage. That they gained immensely by the overthrow of\r\nthe Old Order is undeniable, for apart from the legislation passed on\r\ntheir behalf in the National Assembly, the disorder of the finances in\r\n1796 was such that, as M. Leon Kahn tells us, a contemporary journal\r\nenquired: \"Has the Revolution then been only a financial scheme? a\r\nspeculation of bankers?\"[636] We know from Prudhomme to what race the\r\nfinanciers who principally profited by this disorder belonged.[637]\r\n\r\nBut if the rôle of the Jews in the Revolution remains obscure there can\r\nbe no doubt of the part played by the secret societies in the revolt\r\nagainst all religion, all moral laws, and social order, which had been\r\nreduced to a system in the councils of the Illuminati.\r\n\r\nIt was this conspiracy that reasserted itself in the Babouviste rising\r\nof 1796 which was directly inspired by the secret societies. After the\r\ndeath of Babeuf, his friend and inspirer Buonarotti with the aid of\r\nMarat's brother founded a masonic lodge, the _Amis Sincères_, which was\r\naffiliated to the _Philadelphes_, at Geneva, and as \"Diacre Mobile\" of\r\nthe \"Order of Sublime and Perfect Masons\" created three new secret\r\ndegrees, in which the device of the Rose-Croix I.N.R.I. was interpreted\r\nas signifying \"Justum necare reges injustos.\"[638]\r\n\r\nThe part to be assigned to each intrigue in preparing the world-movement\r\nof which the French Revolution was the first expression is a question on\r\nwhich no one can speak with certainty. But, as at the present moment,\r\nthe composite nature of this movement must never be lost to sight.\r\nLargely perhaps the work of Frederick the Great, it is probable that but\r\nfor the Orléanistes the plot against the French monarchy might have come\r\nto nought; whilst again, but for his position at the head of illuminized\r\nFreemasonry it is doubtful whether the Duc d'Orléans could have\r\ncommanded the forces of revolution. Further, how far the movement,\r\nwhich, like the modern Bolshevist conspiracy, appears to have had\r\nunlimited funds at its disposal, was financed by the Jews yet remains to\r\nbe discovered. Hitherto only the first steps have been taken towards\r\nelucidating the truth about the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of an early nineteenth-century writer the sect which\r\nengineered the French Revolution was absolutely international:\r\n\r\n     The authors of the Revolution are not more French than German,\r\n     Italian, English, etc. They form a particular nation which took\r\n     birth and has grown in the darkness, in the midst of all civilized\r\n     nations, with the object of subjecting them to its domination.[639]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find almost precisely the same idea expressed by the\r\nDuke of Brunswick, formerly the \"Eques a Victoria\" of the Stricte\r\nObservance, \"Aaron\" of the Illuminati, and Grand Master of German\r\nFreemasonry, who, whether because the Revolution had done its work in\r\ndestroying the French monarchy and now threatened the security of\r\nGermany, or whether because he was genuinely disillusioned in the Orders\r\nto which he had belonged, issued a Manifesto to all the lodges in 1794,\r\ndeclaring that in view of the way in which Masonry had been penetrated\r\nby this great sect the whole Order must be temporarily suppressed. It is\r\nessential to quote a part of this important document verbatim:\r\n\r\n     Amidst the universal storm produced by the present revolutions in\r\n     the political and moral world, at this period of supreme\r\n     illumination and of profound blindness, it would be a crime against\r\n     truth and humanity to leave any longer shrouded in a veil things\r\n     that can provide the only key to past and future events, things\r\n     that should show to thousands of men whether the path they have\r\n     been made to follow is the path of folly or of wisdom. It has to do\r\n     with you, VV. FF. of all degrees and of all secret systems. The\r\n     curtain must at last be drawn aside, so that your blinded eyes may\r\n     see that light you have ever sought in vain, but of which you have\r\n     only caught a few deceptive rays....\r\n\r\n     We have raised our building under the wings of darkness; ... the\r\n     darkness is dispelled, and a light more terrifying than darkness\r\n     itself strikes suddenly on our sight. We see our edifice crumbling\r\n     and covering the ground with ruins; we see destruction that our\r\n     hands can no longer arrest. And that is why we send away the\r\n     builders from their workshops. With a last blow of the hammer we\r\n     overthrow the columns of salaries. We leave the temple deserted,\r\n     and we bequeath it as a great work to posterity which shall raise\r\n     it again on its ruins and bring it to completion.\r\n\r\nBrunswick then goes on to explain what has brought about the ruin of the\r\nOrder, namely, the infiltration of Freemasonry by secret conspirators:\r\n\r\n     A great sect arose which, taking for its motto the good and the\r\n     happiness of man, worked in the darkness of the conspiracy to make\r\n     the happiness of humanity a prey for itself. This sect is known to\r\n     everyone: its brothers are known no less than its name. It is they\r\n     who have undermined the foundations of the Order to the point of\r\n     complete overthrow; it is by them that all humanity has been\r\n     poisoned and led astray for several generations. The ferment that\r\n     reigns amongst the peoples is their work. They founded the plans of\r\n     their insatiable ambition on the political pride of nations. Their\r\n     founders arranged to introduce this pride into the heads of the\r\n     peoples. They began by casting odium on religion.... They invented\r\n     the rights of man which it is impossible to discover even in the\r\n     book of Nature, and they urged the people to wrest from their\r\n     princes the recognition of these supposed rights. The plan they had\r\n     formed for breaking all social ties and of destroying all order was\r\n     revealed in all their speeches and acts. They deluged the world\r\n     with a multitude of publications; they recruited apprentices of\r\n     every rank and in every position; they deluded the most\r\n     perspicacious men by falsely alleging different intentions. They\r\n     sowed in the hearts of youth the seed of covetousness, and they\r\n     excited it with the bait of the most insatiable passions.\r\n     Indomitable pride, thirst of power, such were the only motives of\r\n     this sect: their masters had nothing less in view than the thrones\r\n     of the earth, and the government of the nations was to be directed\r\n     by their nocturnal clubs.\r\n\r\n     This is what has been done and is still being done. But we notice\r\n     that princes and people are unaware how and by what means this is\r\n     being accomplished. That is why we say to them in all frankness:\r\n     The misuse of our Order, the misunderstanding of our secret, has\r\n     produced all the political and moral troubles with which the world\r\n     is filled to-day. You who have been initiated, you must join\r\n     yourselves with us in raising your voices, so as to teach peoples\r\n     and princes that the sectarians, the apostates of our Order, have\r\n     alone been and will be the authors of present and future\r\n     revolutions. We must assure princes and peoples, on our honour and\r\n     our duty, that our association is in no way guilty of these evils.\r\n     But in order that our attestations should have force and merit\r\n     belief, we must make for princes and people a complete sacrifice;\r\n     so as to cut out to the roots the abuse and error, we must from\r\n     this moment dissolve the whole Order. This is why we destroy and\r\n     annihilate it completely for the time; we will preserve the\r\n     foundations for posterity, which will clear them when humanity, in\r\n     better times, can derive some benefit from our holy alliance.[640]\r\n\r\nThus, in the opinion of the Grand Master of German Freemasonry, a secret\r\nsect working within Freemasonry had brought about the French Revolution\r\nand would be the cause of all future revolutions. We shall now pursue\r\nthe course of this sect after the first upheaval had ended.\r\n\r\nThree years after the Duke of Brunswick issued his Manifesto to the\r\nlodges, the books of Barruel, Robison, and others appeared, laying bare\r\nthe whole conspiracy. It has been said that all these books \"fell\r\nflat.\"[641] This is directly contrary to the truth. Barruel's book went\r\ninto no less than eight editions, and I have described elsewhere the\r\nalarm that his work and Robison's excited in America. In England they\r\nled to the very tangible result that a law was passed by the English\r\nParliament in 1799 prohibiting all secret societies with the exception\r\nof Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the British Government recognized the\r\ncontinued existence of these associations and the danger they presented\r\nto the world. This fact should be borne in mind when we are assured that\r\nBarruel and Robison had conjured up a bogey which met with no serious\r\nattention from responsible men. For the main purpose of Barruel's book\r\nis to show that not only had Illuminism and Grand Orient Masonry\r\ncontributed largely to the French Revolution, but that three years after\r\nthat first explosion they were still as active as ever. This is the\r\ngreat point which the champions of the \"bogey\" theory are most anxious\r\nto refute. \"The Bavarian Order of the Illuminati,\" wrote Mr. Waite, \"was\r\nfounded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, and it was suppressed by the Elector\r\nof Bavaria in 1789.... Those who say that 'it was continued in more\r\nsecret forms' have never produced one item of real evidence.\"[642] Now,\r\nas we have seen, the Illuminati were not suppressed by the Elector of\r\nBavaria in 1789, but in 1786--first error of Mr. Waite. But more\r\nextraordinary confusion of mind is displayed in his _Encyclopædia of\r\nFreemasonry_, where, in a Masonic Chronology, he gives, this time under\r\nthe date of 1784, \"Suppression of the Illuminati,\" but under 1793:\r\n\"J.J.C. Bode joined the Illuminati under Weishaupt.\" At a matter of\r\nfact, this was the year Bode died. These examples will serve to show the\r\nreliance that can be placed on Mr. Waite's statement concerning the\r\nIlluminati.\r\n\r\nWe shall now see that not only the Illuminati but Weishaupt himself\r\nstill continued to intrigue long after the French Revolution had ended.\r\n\r\nDirectly the Reign of Terror was over, the masonic lodges, which during\r\nthe Revolution had been replaced by the clubs, began to reopen, and by\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century were in a more flourishing\r\ncondition than ever before. \"It was the most brilliant epoch of\r\nMasonry,\" wrote the Freemason Bazot in his History of Freemasonry.\r\nNearly 1,200 lodges existed in France under the Empire; generals,\r\nmagistrates, artists, savants, and notabilities in every line were\r\ninitiated into the Order.[643] The most eminent of these was Prince\r\nCambacérès, pro Grand Master of the Grand Orient.\r\n\r\nIt is in the midst of this period that we find Weishaupt once more at\r\nwork behind the scenes of Freemasonry. Thus in the remarkable masonic\r\ncorrespondence published by M. Benjamin Fabre in his _Eques a Capite\r\nGaleato_--of which, as has already been pointed out, the authenticity is\r\nadmitted by eminent British Freemasons--a letter is reproduced from\r\nPyron, representative in Paris of the Grand Orient of Italy, to the\r\nMarquis de Chefdebien, dated September 9, 1808, in which it is stated\r\nthat \"a member of the sect of Bav.\" has asked for information on a\r\ncertain point of ritual.\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 1808, Pyron writes again: \"By the words 'sect of B....'\r\nI meant W....\"; and on December 3, 1809, puts the matter quite plainly:\r\n\"The other word remaining at the end of my pen refers enigmatically to\r\nWeis=pt.\"\r\n\r\nSo, as M. Fabre points out:\r\n\r\n     There is no longer any doubt that it is a question here of\r\n     Weishaupt, and yet one observes that his name is not yet written in\r\n     all its letters. It must be admitted here that Pyron took great\r\n     precautions when it was a matter of Weishaupt! And one is led to\r\n     ask what could be the extraordinary importance of the rôle played\r\n     at this moment in the Freemasonry of the First Empire by this\r\n     Weishaupt, who was supposed to have been outside the masonic\r\n     movement since Illuminism was brought to trial in 1786![644]\r\n\r\nBut the Marquis de Chefdebien entertained no illusions about Weishaupt,\r\nwhose intrigues he had always opposed, and in a letter dated May 12,\r\n1806, to the Freemason Roettiers, who had referred to the danger of\r\nisolated masonic lodges, he asks:\r\n\r\n     In good faith, very reverend brother, is it in isolated lodges that\r\n     the atrocious conspiracy of Philippe [the Duc d'Orléans] and\r\n     Robespierre was formed? Is it from isolated lodges that those\r\n     prominent men came forth, who, assembled at the Hôtel de Ville,\r\n     stirred up revolt, devastation, assassination? And is it not in the\r\n     lodges bound together, co-and sub-ordinated, that the monster\r\n     Weishaupt established his tests and had his horrible principles\r\n     prepared?[645]\r\n\r\nIf, then, as M. Gustave Bord asserts, the Marquis de Chefdebien had\r\nhimself belonged to the Illuminati before the Revolution, here is indeed\r\nIlluminist evidence in support of Barruel! Yet disillusioned as the\r\n\"Eques a Capite Galeato\" appears to have been with regard to Illuminism,\r\nhe still retained his allegiance to Freemasonry. This would tend to\r\nprove that, however subversive the doctrines of the Grand Orient may\r\nhave been--and indeed undoubtedly were--it was not Freemasonry itself\r\nbut Illuminism which organized the movement of which the French\r\nRevolution was the first manifestation. As Monsignor Dillon has\r\nexpressed it:\r\n\r\n     Had Weishaupt not lived, Masonry might have ceased to be a power\r\n     after the reaction consequent on the French Revolution. He gave it\r\n     a form and character which caused it to outlive that reaction, to\r\n     energize to the present day, and which will cause it to advance\r\n     until its final conflict with Christianity must determine whether\r\n     Christ or Satan shall reign on this earth to the end.[646]\r\n\r\nIf to the word Masonry we add Grand Orient--that is to say, the Masonry\r\nnot of Great Britain, but of the Continent--we shall be still nearer to\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century Illuminism was thus as much\r\nalive as ever. Joseph de Maistre, writing at this period, constantly\r\nrefers to the danger it presents to Europe. Is it not also to Illuminism\r\nthat a mysterious passage in a recent work of M. Lenôtre refers? In the\r\ncourse of conversation with the friends of the false Dauphin Hervagault.\r\nMonsignor de Savine is said to have \"made allusions in prudent and\r\nalmost terrified terms to some international sect ... a power superior\r\nto all others ... which has arms and eyes everywhere and which governs\r\nEurope to-day.\"[647]\r\n\r\nWhen in _World Revolution_ I asserted that during the period that\r\nNapoleon held the reins of power the devastating fire of Illuminism was\r\ntemporarily extinguished, I wrote without knowledge of some important\r\ndocuments which prove that Illuminism continued without break from the\r\ndate of its foundation all through the period of the Empire. So far,\r\nthen, from overstating the case by saying that Illuminism did not cease\r\nin 1786, I understated it by suggesting that it ceased even for this\r\nbrief interval. The documents in which this evidence is to be found are\r\nreferred to by Lombard de Langres, who, writing in 1820, observes that\r\nthe Jacobins were invisible from the 18th Brumaire until 1813, and goes\r\non to say:\r\n\r\n     Here the sect disappears; we find to guide us during this period\r\n     only uncertain notions, scattered fragments; the plots of\r\n     Illuminism lie buried in the boxes of the Imperial police.\r\n\r\nBut the contents of these boxes no longer lie buried; transported to the\r\nArchives Nationales, the documents in which the intrigues of Illuminism\r\nare laid bare have at last been given to the public. Here there can be\r\nno question of imaginative abbés, Scotch professors, or American divines\r\nconjuring up a bogey to alarm the world; these dry official reports\r\nprepared for the vigilant eye of the Emperor, never intended and never\r\nused for publication, relate calmly and dispassionately what the writers\r\nhave themselves heard and observed concerning the danger that Illuminism\r\npresents to all forms of settled government.\r\n\r\nThe author of the most detailed report[648] is one François Charles de\r\nBerckheim, special commissioner of police at Mayence towards the end of\r\nthe Empire, who as a Freemason is naturally not disposed to prejudice\r\nagainst secret societies. In October 1810 he writes, however, that his\r\nattention has been drawn to the Illuminati by a pamphlet which has just\r\nfallen into his hands, namely the _Essai sur la Secte des Illuminés_,\r\nwhich, like many contemporaries, he attributes originally to Mirabeau.\r\nHe then goes on to ask whether the sect still exists, and if so whether\r\nit is indeed \"an association of frightful scoundrels who aim, as\r\nMirabeau assures us, at the overthrow of all law and all morality, at\r\nreplacing virtue by crime in every act of human life.\" Further, he asks\r\nwhether both sects of _Illuminés_ have now combined in one and what are\r\ntheir present projects. Conversations with other Freemasons further\r\nincrease Berckheim's anxiety on the subject; one of the best informed\r\nobserves to him: \"I know a great deal, enough at any rate to be\r\nconvinced that the _Illuminés_ have vowed the overthrow of monarchic\r\ngovernments and of all authority on the same basis.\"\r\n\r\nBerckheim thereupon sets out to make enquiries, with the result that he\r\nis able to state that the _Illuminés_ have initiates all over Europe,\r\nthat they have spared no efforts to introduce their principles into the\r\nlodges, and \"to spread a doctrine subversive of all settled government\r\n... under the pretext of the regeneration of social morality and the\r\namelioration of the lot and condition of men by means of laws founded on\r\nprinciples and sentiments unknown hitherto and contained only in the\r\nheads of the leaders.\" \"Illuminism,\" he declares, \"is becoming a great\r\nand formidable power, and I fear, in my conscience, that kings and\r\npeoples will have much to suffer from it unless foresight and prudence\r\nbreak its frightful mechanism [_ses affreux restorts_].\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, on January 16, 1813, Berckheim writes again to the\r\nMinister of Police:\r\n\r\n     Monseigneur, they write to me from Heidelberg ... that a great\r\n     number of initiates into the mysteries of Illuminism are to be\r\n     found there.\r\n\r\n     These gentlemen wear as a sign of recognition a gold ring on the\r\n     third finger of the left hand; on the back of this ring there is a\r\n     little rose, in the middle of this rose is an almost imperceptible\r\n     dint; by pressing this with the point of a pin one touches a\r\n     spring, by this means the two gold circles are detached. On the\r\n     inside of the first of these circles is the device: \"Be German as\r\n     you ought to be\"; on the inside of the second of these circles are\r\n     engraved the words \"Pro Patria.\"\r\n\r\nSubversive as the ideas of the Illuminati might be, they were therefore\r\nnot subversive of German patriotism. We shall find this apparent paradox\r\nrunning all through the Illuminist movement to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 Berckheim drew up his great report on the secret societies of\r\nGermany, which is of so much importance in throwing a light on the\r\nworkings of the modern revolutionary movement, that extracts must be\r\ngiven here at length.[649] His testimony gains greater weight from the\r\nvagueness he displays on the origins of Illuminism and the role it had\r\nplayed before the French Revolution; it is evident, therefore, that he\r\nhad not taken his ideas from Robison or Barruel--to whom he never once\r\nrefers--but from information gleaned on the spot in Germany. The opening\r\nparagraphs finally refute the fallacy concerning the extinction of the\r\nsect in 1786.\r\n\r\n     The oldest and most dangerous association is that which is\r\n     generally known under the denomination of the _Illuminés_ and of\r\n     which the foundation goes back towards the middle of the last\r\n     century.\r\n\r\n     Bavaria was its cradle; it is said that it had for founders several\r\n     chiefs of the Order of the Jesuits; but this opinion, advanced\r\n     perhaps at random, is founded only on uncertain premises; in any\r\n     case, in a short time it made rapid progress, and the Bavarian\r\n     Government recognized the necessity of employing methods of\r\n     repression against it and even of driving away several of the\r\n     principal sectaries.\r\n\r\n     But it could not eradicate the germ of the evil. The _Illuminés_\r\n     who remained in Bavaria, obliged to wrap themselves in darkness so\r\n     as to escape the eye of authority, became only the more formidable:\r\n     the rigorous measures of which they were the object, adorned by the\r\n     title of persecution, gained them new proselytes, whilst the\r\n     banished members went to carry the principles of the Association\r\n     into other States.\r\n\r\n     Thus in a few years Illuminism multiplied its hotbeds all through\r\n     the south of Germany, and as a consequence in Saxony, in Prussia,\r\n     in Sweden, and even in Russia.\r\n\r\n     The reveries of the Pietists have long been confounded with those\r\n     of the Illuminés. This error may arise from the denomination of the\r\n     sect, which at first suggests the idea of a purely religious\r\n     fanaticism and of mystic forms which it was obliged to take at its\r\n     birth in order to conceal its principles and projects; but the\r\n     Association always had a political tendency. If it still retains\r\n     some mystic traits, it is in order to support itself at need by the\r\n     power of religious fanaticism, and we shall see in what follows how\r\n     well it knows to turn this to account.\r\n\r\n     The doctrine of Illuminism is subversive of every kind of monarchy;\r\n     unlimited liberty, absolute levelling down, such is the fundamental\r\n     dogma of the sect; to break the ties that bind the Sovereign to the\r\n     citizen of a state, that is the object of all its efforts.\r\n\r\n     No doubt some of the principal chiefs, amongst whom are numbered\r\n     men distinguished for their fortune, their birth, and the dignities\r\n     with which they are invested, are not the dupes of these demagogic\r\n     dreams: they hope to find in the popular emotions they stir up the\r\n     means of seizing the reigns of power, or at any rate of increasing\r\n     their wealth and their credit; but the crowd of adepts believe in\r\n     it religiously, and, in order to reach the goal shown to them, they\r\n     maintain incessantly a hostile attitude towards sovereigns.\r\n\r\n     Thus the _Illuminés_ hailed with enthusiasm the ideas that\r\n     prevailed in France from 1789 to 1804. Perhaps they were not\r\n     foreign to the intrigues which prepared the explosions of 1789 and\r\n     the following years; but if they did not take an active part in\r\n     these manoeuvres, it is at least beyond doubt that they openly\r\n     applauded the systems which resulted from them; that the Republican\r\n     armies when they penetrated into Germany found in these sectarians\r\n     auxiliaries the more dangerous for the sovereigns of the invaded\r\n     states in that they inspired no distrust, and we can say with\r\n     assurance that more than one general of the Republic owed a part of\r\n     its success to his understanding with the _Illuminés_.\r\n\r\n     It would be a mistake if one confounded Illuminism with\r\n     Freemasonry. These two associations, in spite of the points of\r\n     resemblance they may possess in the mystery with which they\r\n     surround themselves, in the tests that precede initiation, and in\r\n     other matters of form, are absolutely distinct and have no kind of\r\n     connexion with each other. The lodges of the Scottish Rite number,\r\n     it is true, a few _Illuminés_ amongst the Masons of the higher\r\n     degrees, but these adepts are very careful not to be known as such\r\n     to their brothers in Masonry or to manifest ideas that would betray\r\n     their secret.\r\n\r\nBerckheim then goes on to describe the subtle methods by which the\r\nIlluminati now maintain their existence; learning wisdom from the events\r\nof 1786, their organization is carried on invisibly, so as to defy the\r\neye of authority:\r\n\r\n     It was thought for a long while that the association had a Grand\r\n     Mastership, that is to say, a centre point from which radiated all\r\n     the impulsions given to this great body, and this primary motive\r\n     power was sought for successively in all the capitals of the North,\r\n     in Paris and even in Rome. This error gave birth to another opinion\r\n     no less fallacious: it was supposed that there existed in the\r\n     principal towns lodges where initiations were made and which\r\n     received directly the instructions emanating from the headquarters\r\n     of the Society.\r\n\r\n     If such had been the organization of Illuminism, it would not so\r\n     long have escaped the investigations of which it was the object:\r\n     these meetings, necessarily thronged and frequent, requiring\r\n     besides, like masonic lodges, appropriate premises, would have\r\n     aroused the attention of magistrates: it would not have been\r\n     difficult to introduce false brothers, who, directed and protected\r\n     by authority, would soon have penetrated the secrets of the sect.\r\n\r\n     This is what I have gathered most definitely on the Association of\r\n     the _Illuminés_:\r\n\r\n     First I would point out that by the word hotbeds [foyers] I did not\r\n     mean to designate points of meeting for the adepts, places where\r\n     they hold assemblies, but only localities where the Association\r\n     counts a great number of partisans, who, whilst living isolated in\r\n     appearance, exchange ideas, have an understanding with each other,\r\n     and advance together towards the same goal.\r\n\r\n     The Association had, it is true, assemblies at its birth where\r\n     receptions [i.e. initiations] took place, but the dangers which\r\n     resulted from these made them feel the necessity of abandoning\r\n     them. It was settled that each initiated adept should have the\r\n     right without the help of anyone else to initiate all those who,\r\n     after the usual tests, seemed to him worthy.\r\n\r\n     The catechism of the sect is composed of a very small number of\r\n     articles which might even be reduced to this single principle:\r\n\r\n     \"To arm the opinion of the peoples against sovereigns and to work\r\n     by every method for the fall of monarchic governments in order to\r\n     found in their place systems of absolute independence.\" Everything\r\n     that can tend towards this object is in the spirit of the\r\n     Association....\r\n\r\n     Initiations are not accompanied, as in Masonry, by phantasmagoric\r\n     trials, ... but they are preceded by long moral tests which\r\n     guarantee in the safest way the fidelity of the catechumen; oaths,\r\n     a mixture of all that is most sacred in religion, threats and\r\n     imprecations against traitors, nothing that can stagger the\r\n     imagination is spared; but the only engagement into which the\r\n     recipient enters is to propagate the principles with which he has\r\n     been imbued, to maintain inviolable secrecy on all that pertains to\r\n     the association, and to work with all his might to increase the\r\n     number of proselytes.\r\n\r\n     It will no doubt seem astonishing that there can be the least\r\n     accord in the association, and that men bound together by no\r\n     physical tie and who live at great distances from each other can\r\n     communicate their ideas to each other, make plans of conduct, and\r\n     give grounds of fear to Governments; but there exists an invisible\r\n     chain which binds together all the scattered members of the\r\n     association. Here are a few links:\r\n\r\n     All the adepts living in the same town usually know each other,\r\n     unless the population of the town or the number of the adepts is\r\n     too considerable. In this last case they are divided into several\r\n     groups, who are all in touch with each other by means of members of\r\n     the association whom personal relations bind to two or several\r\n     groups at a time.\r\n\r\n     These groups are again subdivided into so many private coteries\r\n     which the difference of rank, of fortune, of character, tastes,\r\n     etc., may necessitate: they are always small, sometimes composed of\r\n     five or six individuals, who meet frequently under various\r\n     pretexts, sometimes at the house of one member, sometimes at that\r\n     of another; literature, art, amusements of all kinds are the\r\n     apparent object of these meetings, and it is nevertheless in these\r\n     confabulations [_conciliabules_] that the adepts communicate their\r\n     private views to each other, agree on methods, receive the\r\n     directions that the intermediaries bring them, and communicate\r\n     their own ideas to these same intermediaries, who then go on to\r\n     propagate them in other coteries. It will be understood that there\r\n     may be uniformity in the march of all these separated groups, and\r\n     that one day may suffice to communicate the same impulse to all the\r\n     quarters of a large town....\r\n\r\n     These are the methods by which the _Illuminés_, without any\r\n     apparent organization, without settled leaders, agree together from\r\n     the banks of the Rhine to those of the Neva, from the Baltic to the\r\n     Dardanelles, and advance continually towards the same goal, without\r\n     leaving any trace that might compromise the interests of the\r\n     association or even bring suspicion on any of its members; the most\r\n     active police would fail before such a combination....\r\n\r\n     As the principal force of the _Illuminés_ lies in the power of\r\n     opinions, they have set themselves out from the beginning to make\r\n     proselytes amongst the men who through their profession exercise a\r\n     direct influence on minds, such as _littérateurs_, savants, and\r\n     above all professors. The latter in their chairs, the former in\r\n     their writings, propagate the principles of the sect by disguising\r\n     the poison that they circulate under a thousand different forms.\r\n     These germs, often imperceptible to the eyes of the vulgar, are\r\n     afterwards developed by the adepts of the Societies they frequent,\r\n     and the most obscure wording is thus brought to the understanding\r\n     of the least discerning. It is above all in the Universities that\r\n     Illuminism has always found and always will find numerous recruits.\r\n     Those professors who belong to the Association set out from the\r\n     first to study the character of their pupils. If a student gives\r\n     evidence of a vigorous mind, an ardent imagination, the sectaries\r\n     at once get hold of him, they sound in his ears the words\r\n     Despotism--Tyranny--Rights of the People, etc., etc. Before he can\r\n     even attach any meaning to these words, as he advances in age,\r\n     reading chosen for him, conversations skilfully arranged, develop\r\n     the germs deposited in his youthful brain; soon his imagination\r\n     ferments, history, traditions of fabulous times, all are made use\r\n     of to carry his exaltation to the highest point, and before even he\r\n     has been told of a secret Association, to contribute to the fall of\r\n     a sovereign appears to his eyes the noblest and most meritorious\r\n     act....\r\n\r\n     At last, when he has been completely captivated, when several years\r\n     of testing guarantee to the society inviolable secrecy and absolute\r\n     devotion, it is made known to him that millions of individuals\r\n     distributed in all the States of Europe share his sentiments and\r\n     his hopes, that a secret link binds firmly all the scattered\r\n     members of this immense family, and that the reforms he desires so\r\n     ardently must sooner or later come about.\r\n\r\n     This propaganda is rendered the easier by the existing associations\r\n     of students who meet together for the study of literature, for\r\n     fencing, gaming, or even mere debauchery. The Illuminés insinuate\r\n     themselves into all these circles and turn them into hot-beds for\r\n     the propagation of their principles.\r\n\r\n     Such, then, is the Association's continual mode of progression from\r\n     its origins until the present moment; it is by conveying from\r\n     childhood the germ of poison into the highest classes of society,\r\n     in feeding the minds of students on ideas diametrically opposed to\r\n     that order of things under which they have to live, in breaking the\r\n     ties that bind them to sovereigns, that Illuminism has recruited\r\n     the largest number of adepts, called by the state to which they\r\n     were born to be the mainstays of the Throne and of a system which\r\n     would ensure them honours and privileges.\r\n\r\n     Amongst the proselytes of this last class there are some no doubt\r\n     whom political events, the favour of the prince or other\r\n     circumstances, detach from the Association; but the number of these\r\n     deserters is necessarily very limited: and even then they dare not\r\n     speak openly against their old associates, whether because they are\r\n     in dread of private vengeances or whether because, knowing the real\r\n     power of the sect, they want to keep paths of reconciliation open\r\n     to themselves; often indeed they are so fettered by the pledges\r\n     they have personally given that they find it necessary not only to\r\n     consider the interests of the sect, but to serve it indirectly,\r\n     although their new circumstances demand the contrary....\r\n\r\nBerckheim then proceeds to show that those writers on Illuminism were\r\nmistaken who declared that political assassinations were definitely\r\ncommanded by the Order:\r\n\r\n     There is more than exaggeration in this accusation; those who put\r\n     it forward, more zealous in striking an effect than in seeking the\r\n     truth, may have concluded, not without probability, that men who\r\n     surrounded themselves with profound mystery, who propagated a\r\n     doctrine absolutely subversive of any kind of monarchy, dreamt only\r\n     of the assassination of sovereigns; but experience has shown (and\r\n     all the documents derived from the least suspect sources confirm\r\n     this) that the _Illuminés_ count a great deal more on the power of\r\n     opinion than on assassination; the regicide committed on Gustavus\r\n     III is perhaps the only crime of this kind that Illuminism has\r\n     dared to attempt, if indeed it is really proved that this crime was\r\n     its work; moreover, if assassination had been, as it is said, the\r\n     fundamental point in its doctrine, might we not suppose that other\r\n     regicides would have been attempted in Germany during the course of\r\n     the French Revolution, especially when the Republican armies\r\n     occupied the country?\r\n\r\n     The sect would be much less formidable if this were its doctrine,\r\n     on the one hand because it would inspire in most of the _Illuminés_\r\n     a feeling of horror which would triumph even over the fear of\r\n     vengeance, on the other hand because plots and conspiracies always\r\n     leave some traces which guide the authorities to the footsteps of\r\n     the prime instigators; and besides, it is the nature of things that\r\n     out of twenty plots directed against sovereigns, nineteen come to\r\n     light before they have reached the point of maturity necessary to\r\n     their execution.\r\n\r\n     The _Illuminés'_ line of march is more prudent, more skilful, and\r\n     consequently more dangerous; instead of revolting the imagination\r\n     by ideas of regicide, they affect the most generous sentiments:\r\n     declamations on the unhappy state of the people, on the selfishness\r\n     of courtiers, on measures of administration, on all acts of\r\n     authority that may offer a pretext to declamations as a contrast to\r\n     the seductive pictures of the felicity that awaits the nations\r\n     under the systems they wish to establish, such is their manner of\r\n     procedure, particularly in private. More circumspect in their\r\n     writings, they usually disguise the poison they dare not proffer\r\n     openly under obscure metaphysics or more or less ingenious\r\n     allegories. Often indeed texts from Holy Writ serve as an envelope\r\n     and vehicle for these baneful insinuations....\r\n\r\nBy this continuous and insidious form of propaganda the imagination of\r\nthe adepts is so worked on that if a crisis arises, they are ready to,\r\ncarry out the most daring projects.\r\n\r\nAnother Association closely resembling the _Illuminés_, Berckheim\r\nreports, is known as the _Idealists_, whose system is founded on the\r\ndoctrine of perfectibility; these kindred sects \"agree in seeing in the\r\nwords of Holy Scripture the pledge of universal regeneration, of an\r\nabsolute levelling down, and it is in this spirit that the sectarians\r\ninterpret the sacred books.\"\r\n\r\nBerckheim further confirms the assertion I made in _World\r\nRevolution_--contested, as usual, by a reviewer without a shred of\r\nevidence to the contrary--that the Tugendbund derived from the\r\nIlluminati. \"The League of Virtue,\" he writes, \"was directed by the\r\nsecondary chiefs of the _Illuminés_.... In 1810 the Friends of Virtue\r\nwere so identified with the _Illuminés_ in the North of Germany that no\r\nline of demarcation was seen between them.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is time to turn to the testimony of another witness on the\r\nactivities of the secret societies which is likewise to be found at the\r\nArchives Nationales.[650] This consists of a document transmitted by the\r\nCourt of Vienna to the Government of France after the Restoration, and\r\ncontains the interrogatory of a certain Witt Doehring, a nephew of the\r\nBaron d'Eckstein, who, after taking part in secret society intrigues,\r\nwas summoned before the judge Abel at Bayreuth in February, 1824.\r\nAmongst secret associations recently existing in Germany, the witness\r\nasserted, were the \"Independents\" and the \"Absolutes\"; the latter\r\n\"adored in Robespierre their most perfect ideal, so that the crimes\r\ncommitted during the French Revolution by this monster and the\r\nMontagnards of the Convention were in their eyes, in accordance with\r\ntheir moral system, heroic actions ennobled and sanctified by their\r\naim.\" The same document goes on to explain why so many combustible\r\nelements had failed to produce an explosion in Germany:\r\n\r\n     The thing that seemed the great obstacle to the plans of the\r\n     Independents... was what they called the servile character and the\r\n     dog-like fidelity [_Hundestreue_] of the German people, that is to\r\n     say, that attachment--innate and firmly impressed on their minds\r\n     without even the aid of reason--which that excellent people\r\n     everywhere bears towards its princes.\r\n\r\nA traveller in Germany during the year 1795 admirably summed up the\r\nmatter in these words:\r\n\r\n     The Germans are in this respect [of democracy] the most curious\r\n     people in the world ... the cold and sober temperament of the\r\n     Germans and their tranquil imagination enable them to combine the\r\n     most daring opinions with the most servile conduct. That will\r\n     explain to you ... why so much combustible material accumulating\r\n     for so many years beneath the political edifice of Germany has not\r\n     yet damaged it. Most of the princes, accustomed to see their men of\r\n     letters so constantly free in their writings and so constantly\r\n     slavish in their hearts, have not thought it necessary to use\r\n     severity against this sheeplike herd of modern Gracchi and\r\n     Brutuses. Some of them [the princes] have even without difficulty\r\n     adopted part of their opinions, and Illuminism having doubtless\r\n     been presented to them as perfection, the complement of philosophy,\r\n     they were easily persuaded to be initiated into it. But great care\r\n     was taken not to let them know more than the interests of the sect\r\n     demanded.[651]\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Illuminism, unable to provoke a blaze in the home of\r\nits birth, spread, as before the French Revolution, to a more\r\ninflammable Latin race--this time the Italians. Six years after his\r\ninterrogatory at Beyreuth, Witt Doehring published his book on the\r\nsecret societies of France and Italy, in which he now realized he had\r\nplayed the part of dupe, and incidentally confirms the statement I have\r\npreviously quoted, that the Alta Vendita was a further development of\r\nthe Illuminati.\r\n\r\nThis infamous association, with which I have dealt at length\r\nelsewhere,[652] constituted the Supreme Directory of the Carbonari and\r\nwas led by a group of Italian noblemen, amongst whom a prince, \"the\r\nprofoundest of initiates, was charged as Inspector-General of the Order\"\r\nto propagate its principles throughout the North of Europe. \"He had\r\nreceived from the hands of Kingge [i.e. Knigge, the ally of Weishaupt?]\r\nthe cahiers of the last three degrees.\" But these were of course unknown\r\nto the great majority of Carbonari, who entered the association in all\r\ngood faith. Witt Doehring then shows how faithfully the system of\r\nWeishaupt was carried out by the Alta Vendita. In the three first\r\ndegrees, he explains--\r\n\r\n     It is still a question of the morality of Christianity and even of\r\n     the Church, for which those who wish to be received must promise to\r\n     sacrifice themselves. The initiates imagine, according to this\r\n     formula, that the object of the association is something high and\r\n     noble, that it is the Order of those who desire a purer morality\r\n     and a stronger piety, the independence and the unity of their\r\n     country. One cannot therefore judge the Carbonari _en masse_; there\r\n     are excellent men amongst them.... But everything changes after one\r\n     has taken the three degrees. Already in the fourth, in that of the\r\n     _Apostoli_, one promises to overthrow all monarchies, and\r\n     especially the kings of the race of the Bourbons. But it is only in\r\n     the seventh and last degree, reached by few, that revelations go\r\n     further. At last the veil is torn completely for the Principi Summo\r\n     Patriarcho. Then one learns that the aim of the Carbonari is just\r\n     the same as that of the _Illuminés_. This degree, in which a man is\r\n     at the same time prince and bishop, coincides with the Homo Rex of\r\n     the latter. The initiate vows the ruin of all religion and of all\r\n     positive government, whether despotic or democratic; murder,\r\n     poison, perjury, are all at their disposal. Who does not remember\r\n     that on the suppression of the _Illuminés_ was found, amongst other\r\n     poisons, a _tinctura ad abortum faciendum_. The _summo maestro_\r\n     laughs at the zeal of the mass of Carbonari who have sacrificed\r\n     themselves for the liberty and independence of Italy, neither one\r\n     nor the other being for him a goal but a method.[653]\r\n\r\nWitt Doehring, who had himself reached the degree of P.S.P., thereupon\r\ndeclares that, having taken his vows under a misapprehension, he holds\r\nhimself to be released from his obligations and conceives it his duty to\r\nwarn society. \"The fears that assail governments are only too well\r\nfounded. The soil of Europe is volcanic.\"[654]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to go over the ground already traversed in _World\r\nRevolution_ by relating the history of the successive eruptions which\r\nproved the truth of Witt Doehring's warning. The point to emphasize\r\nagain is that every one of these eruptions can be traced to the work of\r\nthe secret societies, and that, as in the eighteenth century, most of\r\nthe prominent revolutionaries were known to be connected with some\r\nsecret association. According to the plan laid down by Weishaupt,\r\nFreemasonry was habitually adopted as a cover. Thus Louis _Amis de la\r\nVérité_, numbering Bazard and Buchez amongst Blanc, himself a Freemason,\r\nspeaks of a lodge named the its founders, \"in which the solemn\r\npuerilities of the Grand Orient only served to mask political action.\"[655]\r\nBakunin, companion of the Freemason Proudhon,[656] \"the father of\r\nAnarchy,\" makes use of precisely the same expression. Freemasonry, he\r\nexplains, is not to be taken seriously, but \"may serve as a mask\" and\r\n\"as a means of preparing something quite different.\"[657]\r\n\r\nI have quoted elsewhere the statement of the Socialist Malon that\r\n\"Bakunin was a disciple of Weishaupt,\" and that of the Anarchist\r\nKropotkine that between Bakunin's secret society--the _Alliance Sociale\r\nDémocratique_--and the secret societies of 1795 there was a direct\r\naffiliation; I have quoted the assertion of Malon that \"Communism was\r\nhanded down in the dark through the secret societies\" of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; I have quoted also the congratulations addressed by Lamartine\r\nand the Freemason Crémieux to the Freemasons of France in 1848 on their\r\nshare in this revolution as in that of 1789; I have shown that the\r\norganization of this later outbreak by the secret societies is not a\r\nmatter of surmise, but a fact admitted by all well-informed historians\r\nand by the members of the secret societies themselves.\r\n\r\nSo, too, in the events of the Commune, and in the founding of the First\r\nInternationale, the role of Freemasonry and the secret societies is no\r\nless apparent. The Freemasons of France have indeed always boasted of\r\ntheir share in political and social upheavals. Thus in 1874, Malapert,\r\norator of the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite,\r\nwent so far as to say: \"In the eighteenth century Freemasonry was so\r\nwidespread throughout the world that one can say that since that epoch\r\nnothing has been done without its consent.\"\r\n\r\nThe secret history of Europe during the last two hundred years yet\r\nremains to be written. Until viewed in the light of the _dessous des\r\ncartes_, many events that have taken place during this period must\r\nremain for ever incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to leave the past and consider the secret forces at work\r\nin the world to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n_THE PRESENT_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nMODERN FREEMASONRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing portion of this book we have followed the history of\r\nFreemasonry in the past and the various interpretations that have been\r\nplaced on its rites and ceremonies. The question now arises: what is the\r\nrole of Freemasonry to-day?\r\n\r\nThe fundamental error of most writers on this question, whether Masonic\r\nor anti-Masonic, is to represent all Freemasons as holding a common\r\nbelief and animated by a common purpose. Thus on one hand the panegyrics\r\nby Freemasons on their Order as a whole, and on the other hand the\r\nsweeping condemnations of the Order by the Catholic Church, are equally\r\nat fault.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Freemasonry in a generic sense is simply a system of\r\nbinding men together for any given purpose, since it is obvious that\r\nallegories and symbols, like the _x_ and _y_ of algebra, can be\r\ninterpreted in a hundred different manners. Two pillars may be said to\r\nrepresent strength and stability, or man and woman, or light and\r\ndarkness, or any other two things we please. A triangle may signify the\r\nTrinity, or Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, or any other triad. To\r\nsay that any of these symbols have an absolute meaning is absurd.\r\n\r\nThe allegories of Freemasonry are equally capable of various\r\ninterpretations. The building of the Temple of Solomon may signify the\r\nprogress of any undertaking and Hiram the victim of its opponents. So\r\nalso with regard to the \"secret tradition\" of Freemasonry concerning \"a\r\nloss which has befallen humanity\"[658] and its ultimate recovery. Any\r\nbody of people working for an object may be said to have experienced a\r\nloss and to aim at its recovery.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the whole organization of Freemasonry, the plan of\r\nadmitting candidates to successive degrees of initiation, of binding\r\nthem to secrecy by fearful oaths, is one that can be employed for any\r\npurpose, social, political, philanthropic, or religious, for promoting\r\nthat which is good or for disseminating that which is evil. It may be\r\nused to defend a throne or to overthrow it, to protect religion or to\r\ndestroy it, to maintain law and order or to create anarchy.\r\n\r\nNow, there was, as we have seen, from the beginning, besides the written\r\ncharges, an _oral tradition_ in Masonry, after the manner of the Cabala,\r\non which the guidance of the society depended. The true character of any\r\nform of Freemasonry is thus not to be judged only by its printed ritual,\r\nbut by the oral instruction of the initiates and the interpretations\r\nplaced on the symbols and ritual. Naturally these interpretations vary\r\nin different countries and at different periods. Freemasonry is\r\ndescribed in its Ritual as \"a peculiar system of morality, veiled in\r\nallegory and illustrated by symbols.\" But what code of morality? In\r\nstudying the history of the Order we shall find that the same code was\r\nby no means common to all masonic bodies, nor is it to-day. Some\r\nmaintain a very high standard of morals; others appear to possess no\r\nstandard at all. Mr. Waite observes that \"the two doctrines of the unity\r\nof God and the immortality of the soul constitute 'the philosophy of\r\nFreemasonry.'\"[659] But these doctrines are by no means essential to\r\nthe existence of Freemasonry; the Grand Orient has renounced both, but\r\nit still ranks as Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nM. Paul Nourrisson is therefore perfectly right in saying: \"There are as\r\nmany Masonries as countries; there is no such thing as universal\r\nMasonry.\"[660] Broadly, however, modern Freemasonry may be divided into\r\ntwo kinds: the variety worked in the British Empire, in America,\r\nHolland, Sweden, Denmark, etc., and Grand Orient Masonry, which prevails\r\nin Catholic countries and of which the most important centre is the\r\nGrand Orient of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContinental Masonry\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that Masonry in Protestant countries is neither revolutionary\r\nnor anti-religious is frequently used by Catholic writers to show that\r\nProtestantism identifies itself with the aims of Masonry, and by\r\nFreemasons to prove that the tyranny of the Church of Rome has driven\r\nMasonry into an attitude hostile to Church and State. The point\r\noverlooked in both these contentions is the essential difference in the\r\ncharacter of the two kinds of Masonry. If the Grand Orient had adhered\r\nto the fundamental principle of British Masonry not to concern itself\r\nwith religion or politics, there is no reason why it should have come\r\ninto conflict with the Church. But its duplicity on this point is\r\napparent. Thus in one of its earlier manuals it declares, like British\r\nMasonry, that it \"never interferes with questions of government or of\r\ncivil and religious legislation, and that whilst making its members\r\nparticipate in the perfecting of all sciences, it positively excepts in\r\nthe lodges two of the most beautiful, _politics_ and _theology_, because\r\nthese two sciences divide men and nations which Masonry constantly tends\r\nto unite.\"[661] But on a further page of the same manual from which\r\nthis quotation is taken we find it stated that Masonry is simply \"the\r\npolitical application of Christianity.\"[662] Indeed, during the last\r\nfifty years the Grand Orient has thrown off the mask and openly declared\r\nitself to be political in its aims. In October 1887 the Venerable Bro∴\r\nBlanc said in a discourse which was printed for the lodges:\r\n\r\n     You recognise with me, my brothers, the necessity for Freemasonry\r\n     to become a vast and powerful political and social society having a\r\n     decisive influence on the resolutions of the Republican\r\n     government.[663]\r\n\r\nAnd in 1890 the Freemason Fernand Maurice declared \"that nothing should\r\nhappen in France without the hidden action of Freemasonry,\" and \"if the\r\nMasons choose to organize, in ten years' time no one in France will be\r\nable to move outside us (_personne ne bougera plus en France en dehors\r\nde nous_).\"[664]\r\n\r\nThis is the despotic power which the Grand Orient has established in\r\nopposition to both Church and Government.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Grand Orient masonry is not only political but subversive in\r\nits political aims. Instead of the peaceful trilogy of British masonry,\r\n\"Brotherly love, relief, and truth,\" it has throughout adhered to the\r\nformula which originated in the Masonic lodges of France and became the\r\nwar-cry of the Revolution: \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\" \"It is the\r\nlaw of equality,\" says Ragon, \"that has always endeared Masonry to the\r\nFrench,\" and \"as long as equality really exists only in the lodges,\r\nMasonry will be preserved in France.\"[665] The aim of Grand Orient\r\nMasonry is thus to bring about universal equality as formulated by\r\nRobespierre and Babeuf. In the matter of liberty we read further that as\r\nmen are all by nature free--the old fallacy of Rousseau and of the\r\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man--therefore \"no one is necessarily\r\nsubjected to another nor has the right to rule him.\"[666] The\r\nrevolutionary expresses the same idea in the phrase that \"no man should\r\nhave a master.\" Finally, by fraternity Grand Orient Masonry denotes the\r\nabolition of all national feeling.\r\n\r\n     It is to Masonry [Ragon says again] that we owe the affiliation of\r\n     all classes of society, it alone could bring about this fusion\r\n     which from its midst has passed into the life of the peoples. It\r\n     alone could promulgate that humanitarian law of which the rising\r\n     activity, tending to a great social uniformity, leads to the fusion\r\n     of races, of different classes, of morals, codes, customs,\r\n     languages, fashions, money, and measures. Its virtuous propaganda\r\n     will become the humanitarian law of all consciences.[667]\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Grand Orient is thus avowedly International Socialism.\r\nIndeed in a further passage Ragon plainly indicates this fact:\r\n\r\n     Every generous reform, every social benefit derives from it, and if\r\n     these survive it is because Masonry lends them its support. This\r\n     phenomenon is due only to the power of its organization. The past\r\n     belongs to it and the future cannot escape from it. By its immense\r\n     lever of association it alone is able to realize by a productive\r\n     communion (_communion génératrice_) that great and beautiful social\r\n     unity conceived by Jaurez, Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier. If Masons\r\n     wish it, the generous conceptions of these philanthropic thinkers\r\n     will cease to be vain Utopias.[668]\r\n\r\nWho are the philanthropic thinkers enumerated here but the men\r\nderisively described by Karl Marx as the \"Utopian Socialists\" of the\r\nnineteenth century? Utopian Socialism is thus simply the open and\r\nvisible expression of Grand Orient Freemasonry. Moreover, these Utopian\r\nSocialists were almost without exception Freemasons or members of other\r\nsecret societies.\r\n\r\nThe Freemason Clavel confirms the foregoing account by Ragon. Thus, like\r\nRagon, he quotes, the principle expressed in a ritual for the initiation\r\nof a Master Mason:\r\n\r\n     It is expressly forbidden to Masons to discuss amongst themselves,\r\n     either in the lodge or outside it, religious and political matters,\r\n     these discussions having usually the effect of creating discord\r\n     where formerly peace, union, and fraternity reigned. This masonic\r\n     law admits of no exceptions.[669]\r\n\r\nBut Clavel also goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     To efface amongst men the distinctions of colour, rank, creed,\r\n     opinions, country; to annihilate fanaticism, and ... the scourge of\r\n     war; in a word, to make of the whole human race one and the same\r\n     family united by affection, by devotion, by work and knowledge:\r\n     that, my brother, is the great work which Freemasonry has\r\n     undertaken, etc.[670]\r\n\r\nUp to a point many a British Freemason reading these passages will\r\ndeclare himself completely in accord with the sentiments expressed.\r\nHumanitarianism, the obliteration of class distinctions, fraternization\r\nbetween men of all races, conditions, and religious creeds, enter of\r\ncourse largely into the spirit of British Masonry, but form simply the\r\nbasis on which Masons meet together in the lodges and not a political\r\nsystem to be imposed on the world in general.\r\n\r\nBritish Masonry thus makes no attempt to interfere with the existing\r\nsocial system or form of Government; the essence of its teaching is that\r\neach member of the Fraternity should seek to reform himself and not\r\nsociety. In a word, individual regeneration takes the place of the\r\nsocial reorganization advocated by the Grand Orient under the influence\r\nof Illuminism. The formula of the \"United States of Europe\" and of the\r\n\"Universal Republic\" first proclaimed by the Illuminatus, Anacharsis\r\nClootz,[671] has long been the slogan of the French lodges.[672]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of religion, Grand Orient Masonry has entirely departed\r\nfrom the principle laid down by the British lodges. If the Catholic\r\nChurch has shown itself hostile to Masonry, it must be remembered that\r\nin Catholic countries Masonry has shown itself militantly anti-Catholic.\r\n\"Freemasonry,\" one of its modern orators declared, \"is the anti-Church,\r\nthe anti-Catholicism, the Church of Heresy (_la contre Eglise, le contre\r\nCatholicisme, l'Eglise de l'Hérésie_).\"[673] The _Bulletin_ of the\r\nGrand Orient in 1885 officially declared: \"We Freemasons must pursue the\r\ndefinite demolition of Catholicism.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Grand Orient goes further than this and attacks all forms of\r\nreligion. Thus, as has been said, those \"ancient landmarks\" of British\r\nMasonry, belief in the Great Architect of the Universe and in the\r\nimmortality of the soul, had never formed an integral part of its\r\nsystem, and it was only in 1849 that for the first time \"it was\r\ndistinctly formulated that the basis of Freemasonry is a belief in God\r\nand in the immortality of the soul, and the solidarity of Humanity.\" But\r\nin September 1877 the first part of this formula was deleted, all\r\nallusions to the Great Architect were omitted, and the statute now\r\nreads: \"Its basis is absolute liberty of conscience and the solidarity\r\nof Humanity.\"[674] British Freemasonry, which does not admit liberty of\r\nconscience in the sense of Atheism, but demands that every Mason should\r\nprofess belief in some form of religion and which insists that the\r\nVolume of the Sacred Law--in England the Bible, in Mohammedan countries\r\nthe Koran, and so on--should be placed on the table in its lodges,\r\nthereupon broke off all relations with the Grand Orient. In March 1878\r\nthe following resolution was passed unanimously:\r\n\r\n     That the Grand Lodge, whilst always anxious to receive in the most\r\n     fraternal spirit the Brethren of any foreign Grand Lodge whose\r\n     proceedings are conducted according to the Ancient Landmarks of the\r\n     Order, of which a belief in T.G.A.O.T.U. is the first and most\r\n     important, cannot recognize as \"true and genuine\" Brethren any who\r\n     have been initiated in lodges which either deny or ignore that\r\n     belief.[675]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Orient, says M. Copin Albancelli, not content with renouncing\r\nthe Great Architect whose glory it had celebrated on every possible\r\noccasion and whose praises had been incessantly sung in its lodges,\r\ndemanded of its initiates that they should declare themselves to be\r\nabsolutely convinced that the Great Architect was nothing but a\r\nmyth.[676] More than this, violent anti-religious tirades have been\r\npermitted and even applauded in the lodges. Thus in 1902 the Freemason\r\nDelpech in his discourse at a masonic banquet uttered these words:\r\n\r\n     The triumph of the Galilean has lasted twenty centuries; he is\r\n     dying in his turn. The mysterious voice which once on the mountains\r\n     of Epirus announced the death of Pan, to-day announces the death of\r\n     the deceiver God who had promised an era of justice and peace to\r\n     those who should believe in him. The illusion has lasted very long;\r\n     the lying God in his turn disappears; he goes to rejoin in the dust\r\n     of ages the other divinities of India, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, who\r\n     saw so many deluded creatures throw themselves at the food of their\r\n     altars. Freemasons, we are pleased to state that we are not\r\n     unconcerned with this ruin of false prophets. The Roman Church,\r\n     founded on the Galilean myth, began to decline rapidly on the day\r\n     when the masonic association was constituted. From the political\r\n     point of view Freemasons have often varied. But in all times\r\n     Freemasonry has stood firm on this principle: war on all\r\n     superstitions, war on all fanaticism.[677]\r\n\r\nHow is it possible to reconcile this attitude towards religion in\r\ngeneral and Christianity in particular with the fact that the Grand\r\nOrient still works the Rose-Croix degree? This degree--which, as we have\r\nseen, was first devised (whether in Scotland or in France) to give a\r\nChristian meaning to Masonry--was only incorporated into British\r\nFreemasonry in 1846 and in our country has retained its original\r\ncharacter. Its ritual, centring around a lost word, signifies that the\r\nOld Testament dispensation has come to an end with the Crucifixion, and\r\nis so strongly Christian that no Jew, Mohammedan, or other non-Christian\r\ncan be admitted to it. Moreover, since this degree, known as the\r\neighteenth degree, forms in reality the first degree of the Ancient and\r\nAccepted Rite, as worked in this country, non-Christians are excluded\r\nfrom the whole of this Rite and can only take the degrees of Royal Arch,\r\nMark Mason, Royal Ark Mariner, and finally Royal Select and\r\nSuper-Excellent Master. Consequently the thirty-three Masons of the\r\nthirty-third degree who compose the Supreme Council which directs the\r\nAncient and Accepted Rite are necessarily professing Christians. Exactly\r\nthe opposite is the case in France; the Rose-Croix, worked by professing\r\natheists and Jews, can only be parody of Christian mysteries.\r\n\r\nNow, it is essential to realize that in France the anti-masonic camp is\r\ndivided into two parties. Whilst the majority of Catholic writers regard\r\nFreemasonry itself as the source of all evil--\"the Synagogue of\r\nSatan\"--more impartial investigators have pronounced the opinion that it\r\nis not Freemasonry even of the Grand Orient variety but something\r\nconcealed behind Freemasonry which constitutes the principal danger.\r\nThis view is expressed by M. Copin Albancelli, whose book _Le Pouvoir\r\nocculte contre la France_ is of the utmost importance to an\r\nunderstanding of the masonic danger, for here there can be no question\r\nof Catholic prejudice or of imaginary accusations made by a stranger to\r\nMasonry. M. Copin Albancelli entered the Grand Orient as an agnostic and\r\nhas never returned to the bosom of the Church; yet as a Frenchman, a\r\npatriot, and a believer in law, morality, and Christian ethics he found\r\nhimself obliged, after six years' experience in the lodges and after\r\nattaining the degree of Rose-Croix, to leave Freemasonry and, further,\r\nto denounce it. From what he himself heard and observed M. Copin\r\nAlbancelli declares the Grand Orient to be anti-patriotic, subversive of\r\nall morality and religious belief, and an immense danger to France.\r\n\r\nBut further than this, M. Copin Albancelli declares the Grand Orient to\r\nbe a system of deception by which members are enlisted in a cause\r\nunknown to themselves; even the initiates of the upper degrees are not\r\nall aware of the real aim of the Order or of the power behind it. M.\r\nCopin Albancelli thus arrives at the conclusion that there are three\r\nFreemasonries one above the other: (i) Blue Masonry (i.e. the three\r\nCraft Degrees), in which none of the real secrets are revealed to the\r\nmembers and which serves merely as a sorting-ground for selecting likely\r\nsubjects; (2) the Upper Degrees, in which most of the members, whilst\r\nimagining themselves to have been initiated into the whole secret of the\r\nOrder and \"bursting with importance\" over their imaginary rôle of\r\nleaders, are only admitted to a partial knowledge of the goal to which\r\nthey are tending; and (3) the inner circle, \"the true masters,\" those\r\nwho conceal themselves behind high-grade Masonry. Admission to this\r\ninner circle may be, moreover, not a matter of degrees. \"Whilst in the\r\nlower Masonries the adepts are obliged to pass through all the degrees\r\nof the established hierarchy, the upper and invisible Freemasonry is\r\ncertainly recruited not only amongst the thirty-three degrees but in all\r\nthe groups of upper-degree Masonry, and perhaps even in certain\r\nexceptional cases outside these.\"[678] This inner and invisible\r\nFreemasonry is to a large extent _international_.\r\n\r\nThe most illuminating passage in the whole of M. Copin Albancelli's book\r\nis where he describes an experience that befell him after he had taken\r\nthe degree of Rose-Croix. It was then that one of his superiors took him\r\naside and addressed him in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     \"You realize the power which Freemasonry has at its disposal. We\r\n     can say that we hold France. It is not because of our numbers,\r\n     since there are only 25,000 Freemasons in this country [this was in\r\n     1889]. Nor is it because we are the brains, for you have been able\r\n     to judge of the intellectual mediocrity of the greater number of\r\n     these 25,000 Freemasons. We hold France because we are organized\r\n     and the only people who are organized. But above all, we hold\r\n     France because we have an aim, this aim is unknown; as it is\r\n     unknown, no obstacle can be put in its way; and finally, as no\r\n     obstacle is put up, the way is wide open before us. This is\r\n     logical, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Absolutely.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Good. But what would you say of an association which instead of\r\n     consisting of 25,000 nonentities as in Freemasonry, were composed\r\n     of, say, only a thousand individuals, but a thousand individuals\r\n     recruited in the manner that I will tell you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Freemason went on to explain the way in which such individuals\r\nwere selected, the months and years of observation, of supervision, to\r\nwhich they were subjected, so as to form a body of picked men inside\r\nFreemasonry capable of directing its operations.\r\n\r\n     \"You can imagine the power at the command of such an association?\"\r\n\r\n     \"An association thus selected would do anything it chose. It could\r\n     possess the world if it pleased.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the higher adept, after asking for a further promise of\r\nsecrecy, declared:\r\n\r\n     \"Well, in exchange for this promise, Brother Copin, I am authorized\r\n     to let you know that this association exists and that, further, I\r\n     am authorized to introduce you into it.\"[679]\r\n\r\nIt was then that Monsieur Copin Albancelli understood that the point to\r\nwhich the conversation was leading up was not, as he had at first\r\nsupposed, an invitation to take the next step in Freemasonry--the\r\nthirtieth degree of Knight Kadosch--but to enter through a side-door\r\ninto an association concealed within Freemasonry and for which the\r\nvisible organization of the latter served merely as a cover. A very\r\ncurious resemblance will here be noticed between the method of sounding\r\nM. Copin Albancelli and that of the Illuminatus Cato in the matter of\r\nSavioli, described in a passage already quoted:\r\n\r\n     Now that he is a Mason I have ... taken up the general plan of our\r\n     ⊙, and as this pleased him I said that such a thing really existed,\r\n     whereat he gave me his word that he would enter it.\r\n\r\nM. Copin Albancelli, however, did not give his word that he would enter\r\nit, but, on the contrary, checked further revelations by declaring that\r\nhe would leave Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nThis experience had afforded him a glimpse of \"a world existing behind\r\nthe masonic world, more secret than it, unsuspected by it as by the\r\noutside world.\"[680] Freemasonry, then, \"can only be the half-lit\r\nantechamber of the real secret society. That is the truth.\"[681] \"There\r\nexists then necessarily a permanent directing Power. We cannot see that\r\nPower, therefore it is occult.\"[682]\r\n\r\nFor some time M. Copin Albancelli concluded this Power to be \"the Jewish\r\npower,\" and elaborated the idea in a further work[683]; but the war has\r\nled him to develop his theories in yet another book, which will shortly\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nThat the lodges of the Grand Orient are largely controlled by Jews is,\r\nhowever, certain, and that they are centres of political propaganda is\r\nequally undeniable. We have only to glance at the following\r\nextracts--some of which are reproduced on the opposite page--from the\r\nprogramme of debates in the _Bulletin_ of the Grand Orient for June 5,\r\n1922, to recognize that the ideas they propagate are simply those of\r\nInternational Socialism:\r\n\r\n     Loge \"Union et France\": Lecture du Rapport de notre T∴ C∴ F∴\r\n     Chardard sur \"L'Exploitation des richesses nationales au profit de\r\n     la collectivité.\"\r\n\r\n     Loge \"Les Rénovateurs\": \"Exploitation des Richesses nationales et\r\n     des grosses Entreprises an profit de la collectivité.\" Conférence\r\n     de notre F∴ Goldschmidt, Orat∴ adjoint sur la même question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: News paper clippings]\r\n\r\n     Loge \"Les Zélés Philanthropes\": \"La Transformation de la Société\r\n     Actuelle s'impose-t-elle?\" Conférence par le T∴ C∴ F∴ Edmond\r\n     Cottin.\r\n\r\n     Loge \"Paix-Travail-Solidarité\": \"Rôle de la Franc-Maçonnerie dans\r\n     la politique actuelle\" par le F∴ F∴\r\n\r\n     Loge \"Les Trinitaires\": \"Le Socialisme Français\" par le T∴ Ill. F∴\r\n     Elie May.\r\n\r\n     Ten∴ Collective des L∴ \"Emmanuel Arago\" & \"les Coeurs Unis\r\n     indivisibles\": \"Comment propager notre Idéal Maçonnique dans le\r\n     Monde profane.\" Conférence par le F∴ Jahia, de la R∴ L∴ Isis\r\n     Monthyon.\r\n\r\n     Loge \"Isis Monthyon et Conscience et Volonté\": \"La Terreur et le\r\n     Péril Fasciste en Italie, le Fascisme et la F∴-Maç∴ Italienne,\"\r\n     impressions de notre F∴ Mazzini, de retour, après un séjour\r\n     prolongé en Italie.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the last of these extracts that Grand Orient Masonry\r\nis the enemy of Fascismo, which saved Italy in her hour of peril.\r\nIndeed, the Italian Masons passed a resolution which was directly\r\nopposed to Fascist views, especially with regard to the religious policy\r\nof Mussolini, who has restored the crucifix to the schools and religious\r\nteaching to the curriculum. The Fascist _Giornale di Roma_ declared that\r\nthe principles announced by the Masons in this resolution were those\r\nwhich threatened to submerge the State and nation. Consequently\r\nMussolini declared that Fascisti must either leave their lodges or leave\r\nFascismo.[684]\r\n\r\nIn Belgium Freemasonry has taken the same political and anti-religious\r\ncourse. In 1856 the directing committee of the Belgian Grand Orient\r\ndeclared: \"Not only is it the right but the duty of the lodges to\r\nsupervise the actions in public life of those amongst its members whom\r\nit has placed in political posts, the right to demand\r\nexplanations....\"[685] When in 1866 at a funeral ceremony in honour of\r\nthe deceased King Leopold I the Grand Orient of Belgium displayed the\r\nmaxim, \"The soul which has emanated from God is immortal,\" the\r\nFreemasons of Louvain entered a violent protest on the ground that\r\n\"Free-thinking had been admitted by the Belgian lodges in 1864 as its\r\nfundamental principle,\" and that the Grand Orient had therefore violated\r\nthe convictions of its members.[686]\r\n\r\nIn Spain and Portugal Freemasonry has played not merely a subversive\r\nbut an actively revolutionary and sanguinary rôle. The anarchist Ferrer,\r\nintimately concerned with a plot to murder the King of Spain, was at the\r\nsame moment entrusted with negotiations between the Grand Orient of\r\nFrance and the Grand Lodge of Catalonia.[687] These murderous schemes,\r\nfrustrated in Spain, met, however, in Portugal with complete success.\r\nThe Portuguese revolutions from 1910 to 1921 were organized under the\r\ndirection of Freemasonry and the secret society of Carbonarios. The\r\nassassination of King Carlos and his elder son had been prepared by the\r\nsame secret organizations. In 1908 a pamphlet modelled on the libels\r\npublished against Marie Antoinette was directed against Queen Amélie and\r\nher husband. A month later the assassination took place. Amongst the\r\nleaders of the new Republic was Magalhaes Lima, Grand Master of the\r\nGrand Orient of Portugal.[688]\r\n\r\nThe authorship of these disorders was, in fact, so clearly recognized\r\nthat honest Freemasons forsook the lodges. An English Mason, unaware of\r\nthe true character of Portuguese Freemasonry, when in Lisbon in August\r\n1919, made himself known to several moderate Portuguese Masons, who,\r\nwhile glad to welcome him as a brother, refused to take him to a lodge,\r\ndeclaring that they had severed all connection with Masonry since it had\r\npassed under the control of assassins. They also added that the\r\nassassination of Señor Paes, the President in December 1918, was the\r\nwork of certain Portuguese lodges. A special meeting had previously been\r\nheld in Paris in conjunction with the Grand Orient of France, at which\r\nit had been decided that Paes was to be removed. This decision reached,\r\nthe earliest opportunity of putting it into force was sought--with fatal\r\nresults. The assassin was imprisoned in the Penitentiary but liberated\r\nby the revolution of 1921, and no attempt has been made to recapture\r\nhim. The murder of Dr. Antonio Granjo in October 1921 was traced to the\r\nsame agency. In the pocket of the murdered man was found a document from\r\nthe \"Lodge of Liberty and Justice\"(!) warning him of the decision taken\r\nagainst him for having ordered the police to protect the British tramway\r\ncompany.[689]\r\n\r\nThe present Portuguese Government, indeed, makes no secret of its\r\nmasonic character and prints the square and compass on its bank-notes.\r\n\r\nBut whilst in Spain and Portugal Freemasonry manifested itself in\r\nAnarchist outrages, in the east of Europe the lodges, largely under the\r\ncontrol of Jews, followed the line of Marxian Socialism. After the fall\r\nof the Bela Kun régime in Hungary a raid on the lodges brought to light\r\ndocuments clearly revealing the fact that the ideas of Socialism had\r\nbeen disseminated by the Freemasons. Thus in the minutes of meetings it\r\nwas recorded that on November 16, 1906, Dr. Kallos had addressed the\r\nGyor Lodge on Socialist ideals. \"The ideal world which we call the\r\nmasonic world,\" he declared, \"will be also a Socialist world and the\r\nreligion of Freemasonry is that of Socialism as well.\" Dr. Kallos then\r\nproceeded to acquaint the members with the theories of Marx and Engels,\r\nshowing that no help was to be found in Utopias, as the interests of the\r\nproletarians were in absolute conflict with those of other classes, and\r\nthese differences could only be settled by international class warfare.\r\nNevertheless with that fear of the proletariat which has always\r\ncharacterized the democrats of revolutionary Freemasonry, Dr. Kallos\r\ndeclared later that \"the social revolution must take place without\r\nbloodshed.\"[690] The Karolyi régime was the direct outcome of these\r\nillusions, and as in all revolutions paved the way for the more violent\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nStill further east in Europe the lodges, though revolutionary, instead\r\nof following the International Socialist line of Hungarian Freemasonry,\r\nexhibited a political and nationalist character. The Young Turk movement\r\noriginated in the masonic lodges of Salonica under the direction of the\r\nGrand Orient of Italy, which later contributed to the success of\r\nMustapha Kemal. Moreover, as we approach the Near East, cradle of the\r\nmasonic system, we find the Semitic influence not only of the Jews but\r\nof other Semite races directing the lodges. In Turkey, in Egypt, in\r\nSyria now, as a thousand years ago, the same secret societies which\r\ninspired the Templars have never ceased to exist, and in this mingling\r\nof the East and West it is possible that the Grand Orient may draw\r\nreinforcement from those sources whence it drew its system and its name.\r\n\r\nAmongst the strange survivals of early Eastern sects are the Druses of\r\nLebanon, who might indeed be described as the Freemasons of the East;\r\ntheir outer organization closely resembles that of the Craft Degrees in\r\nWestern Masonry, yet such is their power of secrecy that few if any\r\nEuropeans have ever succeeded in discovering the secret doctrines. That\r\ntheir tendency is largely political admits of little doubt; in fact men\r\nintimately acquainted with the Near East have declared that the\r\ninfluence they exercise over the politics of that region is as\r\nfar-reaching as that of the Grand Orient over the affairs of Europe and\r\nthat they form the breeding-ground of all political ideas and changes.\r\nThough small in numbers this mysterious society is composed of past\r\nmasters in the game of intrigue, who, whilst playing apparently a minor\r\npart at political meetings, secret or otherwise, or even remaining\r\ncompletely silent, contrive to influence decisions with startling\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish Masonry\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the further ways in which British Masonry differs\r\nfrom the Grand Orient.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, whilst working the same degrees, its rituals,\r\nformulas, and ceremonies, as also the interpretation it places on words\r\nand symbols, are different in many essential points.\r\n\r\nSecondly, British Masonry is essentially an honest institution. Whereas\r\nin the Grand Orient the initiate is led through a maze of ceremonies\r\ntowards a goal unknown to him which he may discover too late to be other\r\nthan he supposed, the British initiate, although admitted by gradual\r\nstages to the mysteries of the Craft, knows nevertheless from the\r\nbeginning the general aim of the Order.\r\n\r\nThirdly, British Masonry is primarily philanthropic and the sums it\r\ndevotes to charitable purposes are immense. Since the war the three\r\nprincipal masonic charities have collected annually over £300,000.\r\n\r\nBut the point to be emphasized here is that British Masonry is strictly\r\nnon-political, not merely in theory but in practice, and that it\r\nenforces this principle on every occasion. Thus before the recent\r\nGeneral Election, the Report of the Board of General Purposes, drawn up\r\nby Grand Lodge on December 5, 1923, recalled to the notice of the Craft\r\nthat \"'all subjects of a political nature are strictly excluded from\r\ndiscussion in masonic meetings,' this being in accordance with\r\nlong-established masonic tradition ... it follows from this that Masonry\r\nmust not be used for any personal or party purpose in connexion with an\r\nelection.\" It further emphasized the distinct caution \"that any attempt\r\nto bring the Craft into the electioneering arena would be treated as a\r\nserious masonic offence.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time a fresh injunction was made with regard to the Grand\r\nOrient of France:\r\n\r\n     As recognition was withdrawn from that body by the United Grand\r\n     Lodge of England in 1878, ... it is considered necessary to warn\r\n     all members of our lodges that they cannot visit any lodge under\r\n     the obedience of a jurisdiction unrecognized by the United Grand\r\n     Lodge of England; and further that under Rule 150 of the Book of\r\n     Constitutions, they cannot admit visitors therefrom.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given at the beginning of this section British Masonry\r\nstands rigidly aloof from all attempts to create an international system\r\nof Masonry. The idea was first suggested at the Masonic Congress of\r\nParis in 1889, convened to celebrate the centenary of the first French\r\nRevolution, but led to nothing very definite until the Congress of\r\nGeneva in September 1902, at which the delegates of thirty-four lodges,\r\nGrand Lodges, Grand Orients, and Supreme Councils were present, and a\r\nproposal was unanimously adopted \"tending towards the creation of an\r\nInternational Bureau for Masonic Affairs,\" to which twenty Powers,\r\nmostly Europeans, gave their adherence. Brother Desmons, of the Grand\r\nOrient of France, in an after-dinner speech declared it to have been\r\nalways \"the dream of his life\" that \"all democracies should meet and\r\nunderstand one another in such a way as one day to form the Universal\r\nRepublic.\"[691]\r\n\r\nAccording to the official report of the proceedings, \"the\r\nrepresentatives of Belgium, Holland, France, Germany, England, Spain,\r\nItaly, and Switzerland greeted with much feeling the dawn of this new\r\nera.\" The same Report goes on to observe that--\r\n\r\n     It is altogether a mistake ... to believe that Freemasonry does not\r\n     attack the defects of such and such a State, and that consequently\r\n     it remains a stranger to party-strife and the tendencies of the\r\n     times.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     Freemasonry has imposed upon itself a task--a mission. It is a\r\n     question of nothing less than the rebuilding of society on an\r\n     entirely new basis, which shall be more in accordance with the\r\n     present conditions of the means of communication, of situation, and\r\n     production, as well as of a reform of right, of a complete renewal\r\n     of the principle of existence, especially of the principle of\r\n     community and of the relations of men among one another.\r\n\r\nThe Report here quoted is, however, inaccurate in one important\r\nparticular. No English delegates were present at the Geneva Congress or\r\non any other occasion of the kind. There was a delegate from Adelaide\r\nwho spoke a good deal, but the Chairman specifically mentioned England\r\nas taking no part in the movement. Later on, in a Report of the Board of\r\nGeneral Purposes to Grand Lodge on March 2, 1921, a letter from Lord\r\nAmpthill, pro Grand Master, appears, declining an invitation from the\r\nSwiss Grand Lodge Alpina to British Freemasons to attend an\r\nInternational Masonic Congress in Geneva and quoting the following\r\nletter from the Grand Secretary as an earlier precedent for this\r\nrefusal:\r\n\r\n     I am directed to state, in reply to the invitation to attend an\r\n     International Masonic Conference in Switzerland during the coming\r\n     autumn, that the United Grand Lodge of England will be unable to\r\n     send representatives on the occasion. It never participates in a\r\n     Masonic gathering in which are treated as an open question what it\r\n     has always held to be ancient and essential Landmarks of the Craft,\r\n     these being an express belief in the Great Architect of the\r\n     Universe, and an obligatory recognition of the Volume of the Sacred\r\n     Law. Its refusal to remain in fraternal association with such\r\n     Sovereign Jurisdictions as have repudiated or made light of these\r\n     Landmarks has long been upon record, and its resolve in this regard\r\n     remains unshaken.\r\n\r\nLord Ampthill then went on to say:\r\n\r\n     A further consequence of certain happenings of the war is to make\r\n     more firm our resolve to keep, as far as in us lies, Freemasonry\r\n     strictly away from participation in politics, either national or\r\n     international. This attitude of aloofness from necessarily\r\n     controversial affairs of State, on which Brethren can legitimately\r\n     and most properly differ, has ever been maintained by our Grand\r\n     Lodge since it was first convened in 1717. Because of this, it held\r\n     aloof from such international conferences as were summoned during\r\n     the war; and never more than now has the necessity for the\r\n     maintenance of this attitude been felt by British Freemasons....\r\n     For these reasons, the invitation to participate in the proposed\r\n     International Conference of Freemasons at Geneva cannot be\r\n     accepted. Such an assembly might be termed informal, but inevitably\r\n     it would be regarded as opening a door to compromise on those\r\n     things which this Grand Lodge has always held to be essentials.\r\n     Such a compromise English Freemasonry will never contemplate. On\r\n     these essentials we take the firm stand we have always done; we\r\n     cannot detract from full recognition of the Great Architect of the\r\n     Universe, and we shall continue to forbid the introduction of\r\n     political discussion into our Lodges.\r\n\r\nBritish Masonry has thus taken a firm stand against the Grand Orient.\r\nBut it is regrettable that views so admirably expressed should be\r\nconfined to masonic correspondence and not made more apparent to the\r\nworld in general. On the Continent, outside masonic circles, the\r\ndifference between British Masonry and the Grand Orient variety is _not_\r\nsufficiently known, and the reticence of leading British Masons on this\r\nsubject has not only played into the hands of the intractable\r\nanti-Masons, who declare all Masonry to be harmful, but has strengthened\r\nthe position of the revolutionaries who use Masonry for a subversive\r\npurpose. Thus in the Portuguese revolution of 1920 the Masons of that\r\ncountry who were directing the movement sheltered themselves behind the\r\ngood name of England. \"How can you accuse the lodges of being murder\r\nclubs,\" they said to the people, \"when Masonry is directed by England\r\nand had King Edward for its Grand Master?\"\r\n\r\nHowever ludicrous all this may seem to the British public, yet for the\r\nhonour of our country such accusations should not remain unrefuted. A\r\nwitness of the disorders that took place in Portugal declared to the\r\npresent writer that if only Grand Lodge of England would have published\r\na notice in the Continental press disassociating itself from the Grand\r\nOrient in general and from Portuguese Freemasonry in particular, the\r\npower of the revolutionaries would have been immensely weakened and the\r\nanti-British and pro-German propaganda then circulating in the country\r\ndefeated. But British Freemasonry preferred to maintain an attitude of\r\naloofness, contenting itself with issuing periodical warnings against\r\nthe Grand Orient privately to the lodges.\r\n\r\nThis policy has done much to damage not only the good name of England\r\nbut of British Masonry in the eyes of the outside world, and\r\nparticularly in those of Roman Catholics, which is the more regrettable\r\nsince Freemasonry and the Roman Catholic Church are the only two\r\norganized bodies in this country which really exercise discipline over\r\ntheir members and forbid them to belong to subversive secret societies;\r\nhence they provide the two strongest bulwarks against the occult forces\r\nof revolution. For this reason, as we shall see later, they are the two\r\nbodies which are the most feared by the recruiting agents of these\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of Freemasonry the fact is unfortunately too little\r\nknown to the world in general. As a singularly broad-minded Jesuit has\r\nrecently expressed it:\r\n\r\n     The anti-clerical and revolutionary activities of Continental\r\n     Freemasonry did not begin when the Grand Orient finally abolished\r\n     God. During a century and more these evil forces had been at work.\r\n     Nevertheless English Masons only shrugged their shoulders and\r\n     looked another way, though the true character of foreign Masonry\r\n     was brought to their notice in such books as that of John Robison,\r\n     _Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments\r\n     of Europe_....\r\n\r\n     No doubt [the same writer says again] there has been at times a\r\n     deplorable amount of exaggeration among Continental Catholics in\r\n     attributing all the moral and social evils of the world to the\r\n     insidious workings of Freemasonry.... But so long as English\r\n     Freemasons resolutely avert their gaze from the anti-religious and\r\n     anti-social activities of their Continental brethren there can be\r\n     no hope of any better understanding.[692]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny the truth of these strictures. As has already\r\nbeen pointed out in the course of this book, British Freemasons have\r\nfrequently not only ignored Robison's warning but vilified him as the\r\nenemy of Masonry, although he never attacked their Order but only the\r\nperverted systems of the Continent; too often also they have exonerated\r\nthe most dangerous secret societies, notably the Illuminati, because,\r\napparently from a mistaken sense of loyalty, they conceive it their duty\r\nto defend any association of a masonic character. This is simply\r\nsuicidal. British Masonry has no bitterer enemies than the secret\r\nsocieties working for subversion, which, from the Illuminati onwards,\r\nhave always regarded honest Masonry with contempt and used its doctrines\r\nfor an ulterior purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how these doctrines may be perverted to an end\r\ndirectly opposed to that which British Masons have in view. Thus, for\r\nexample, the idea of the brotherhood of man in the sense of love for all\r\nhumanity is the essence of Christianity--\"Be kindly affectioned one to\r\nanother with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another.\" In\r\nadopting \"brotherly love\" as a part of their sacred trilogy British\r\nMasons adopt an entirely Christian standpoint. But if by the brotherhood\r\nof man is meant that men of every race are equally related and that\r\ntherefore one owes the same duty to foreigners as to one's\r\nfellow-countrymen it is obvious that all national feeling must vanish.\r\nThe British Freemason does not, of course, interpret the theory in this\r\nmanner; he cannot seriously regard himself as the brother of the Bambute\r\npygmy or the Polynesian cannibal, thus he uses the term merely in a\r\nvague and theoretical sense.\r\n\r\nWhat indeed does the word \"brother\" literally mean? If we consult the\r\ndictionary we shall see it defined as \"a male born of the same parents;\r\nanyone closely united with or resembling one another; associated in\r\ncommon interests, occupation,\" etc. It is therefore obviously absurd to\r\nsay that men of such different races as those referred to are brothers;\r\nthey are not born of the same kind of parents, they are not united in\r\ntheir aims, they do not remotely resemble one another, and they are not\r\nassociated in common interests and occupations. Though these happen to\r\nbe extreme cases, there are nevertheless essential differences between\r\nmen of the same zone and climate. The Englishman and the Frenchman are\r\nnot brothers because they do not see life from the same point of view,\r\nbut that is no reason why they should not be close allies.\r\n\r\nThe brotherhood of man, if taken literally, is therefore a misleading\r\nterm, nor is such a relationship necessary to the peace of the world.\r\nCain and Abel were not better friends, for being brothers. David and\r\nJonathan, on the other hand, were not brothers but devoted friends. In\r\nstriving after universal brotherhood in a literal sense, Freemasons are\r\ntherefore pursuing a chimera.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous fallacy to which democracy, under the influence of\r\nIlluminized Freemasonry, has succumbed is that peace between nations can\r\nbe brought about by means of Internationalism, that is to say, by the\r\ndestruction of national feeling. Yet a man is not more likely to live at\r\npeace with his neighbours because he is devoid of natural affection; on\r\nthe contrary, the good brother, the devoted father, is most likely to\r\nbecome the faithful friend. Permanent peace between nations will\r\nprobably never be ensured, but the only basis on which such a situation\r\ncan conceivably be established is the basis of sane Nationalism--an\r\nunderstanding between the patriotic and virile elements in every\r\ncountry which, because they value their own liberties and revere their\r\nown traditions, are able to respect those of other nations.\r\nInternationalism is an understanding between the decadent elements in\r\neach country--the conscientious objectors, the drawing-room Socialists,\r\nthe visionaries--who shirk the realities of life and, as the Socialist\r\nKarl Kautsky in a description of Idealists has admirably expressed it,\r\n\"see only differences of opinion and misapprehension where there are\r\nactually irreconcilable antagonisms.\" This is why at times of crisis\r\nIdealists are of all men the most dangerous and Pacifists the great\r\npromoters of wars. Understanding between nations is wholly desirable,\r\nbut the destruction of the national spirit everywhere can only lead to\r\nthe weakening of all countries where this process takes place and the\r\ntriumph of the nations who refuse to accept the same principle.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be answered that Freemasons do not believe in the\r\ndoctrine of brotherhood between all men, but only between Masons of all\r\nraces. But this may lead no less to national disintegration if it\r\ncreates a nation within each nation, an international fraternity\r\nindependent of the countries to which its members belong. The logical\r\noutcome of this may be that a man will refuse to fight for his country\r\nagainst his brother Masons--it is what has happened in France. The Grand\r\nOrient was before the recent war the great breeding-ground of\r\nanti-patriotism, where all schemes for national defence were\r\ndiscouraged. Before 1870 the same thing took place, and it was in the\r\nmasonic lodges that Germany found her most valuable allies.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the doctrine of the perfectibility of human nature lends\r\nitself to perversion. Nothing could be more desirable than that man\r\nshould strive after perfection. Did not Christ enjoin His disciples: \"Be\r\nye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is\r\nperfect\"? Man is therefore acting in accordance with Christian\r\nprinciples in seeking after divine perfection. But when he comes to\r\nbelieve that he has already attained it he makes of himself a god. \"If I\r\njustify myself,\" said Job, \"mine own mouth shall condemn me; if I say I\r\nam perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.\" And St. John: \"If we say\r\nwe have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" More\r\nthan this, if we seek perfection in others we deceive ourselves equally\r\nand make gods of men. This is precisely the conclusion at which\r\nperverted Freemasonry and the forms of Socialism deriving from it\r\narrive. Human nature, they say, is itself divine; what need then for\r\nother divinities? The Catholic Church is consequently quite right in\r\ndeclaring that the doctrine of the perfectibility of human nature leads\r\nto the deification of humanity in that it puts humanity in the place of\r\nGod. The Grand Orient, which definitely accepts this doctrine, has\r\ntherefore logically erased the name of the Great Architect of the\r\nUniverse from its ritual and has become an association of Freethinkers\r\nand Atheists.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to point out the folly as well as the crime of this\r\ndelusion--the ludicrous inconsequence of men who divinize humanity yet\r\nrevile what they call \"society\"? All the evils of the world, they\r\ndeclare, are not to be found in nature but in \"man-made laws,\" in the\r\ninstitutions of \"society.\" Yet what is society but the outcome of human\r\nwills, of human aspirations? Society may be, and no doubt is, in need of\r\nreformation, but are not its imperfections the creation of imperfect\r\nbeings? It is true that to-day the world is in a state of chaos,\r\nindustrial chaos, political chaos, social chaos, religious chaos.\r\nEverywhere men are losing faith in the causes they are supposed to\r\nrepresent; authority questions its own right to govern, democracy is\r\nrent with divisions, the ruling classes are abdicating in favour of\r\nunscrupulous demagogues, the ministers of religion barter their faith\r\nfor popularity.\r\n\r\nAnd what has brought the world to this pass? Humanity! Humanity, that\r\nall-wise, all-virtuous abstraction that needs no light from Heaven.\r\nHumanity that was to take the place of God! If ever there was a moment\r\nin the history of the world when the futility of this pretension should\r\nbe apparent it is the present moment. All the ills, all the confusion,\r\nwhat are they but the outcome of human error and of human passions? It\r\nis not Capitalism that has failed, nor yet Democracy, nor yet even\r\nSocialism as a principle, it is not monarchy that has broken down, nor\r\nRepublicanism, nor again religion; _it is humanity that has broken\r\ndown_. The ills of Capitalism arise from the egoism of individual\r\ncapitalists; Socialism has failed because, as Robert Owen discovered,\r\nthe idle, the quarrelsome, the selfish have prevented its success. If\r\nmen were perfect, Socialism might succeed, but so might any other\r\nsystem. A perfect capitalist would love his employee as himself, just as\r\na perfect Socialist would be willing to work for the common good. It is\r\nthe imperfections of human nature that prevent, and will always prevent,\r\nany system from being perfect. There will never be a Millennium of man's\r\nmaking. Only the application of Christian principles to human conduct\r\ncan bring about a better order of things.\r\n\r\nGrand Orient Masonry, in deifying human nature, thus not only builds\r\nupon the sand, but by its rejection of all religion takes away the sole\r\nhope of human progress. Meanwhile, by the support it lends to Socialism\r\nit encourages the class war instead of the brotherhood between men of\r\nall ranks and conditions which it professes to advocate. British\r\nFreemasonry, on the other hand, whilst not interpreting brotherhood in a\r\npolitical sense, nevertheless contributes to social peace. At the annual\r\nconference of the Labour Party in 1923 a proposal was made by the\r\nextreme section that \"any person who is a Free mason should be excluded\r\nfrom any kind of office,\" it being suggested that \"in cases where an\r\nunderstanding has been reached between Trade Union leaders and\r\nemployers, thus preventing or limiting industrial trouble, the secret\r\nhas been the bond of Freemasonry.\"[693] Whether this was the case or\r\nnot, British Masonry, by taking its stand on patriotism and respect for\r\nreligion, necessarily tends to unite men of all classes and therefore\r\noffers a formidable bulwark against the forces of revolution. Any\r\nattacks on British Masonry as at present constituted and directed are\r\ntherefore absolutely opposed to the interests of the country. But at the\r\nsame time it behoves Masons to beware of the insidious attempts that are\r\nbeing made by irregular secret societies to infiltrate the Craft and\r\npervert its true principles. The present satisfactory condition of\r\nFreemasonry in England is owing not only to its established statutes,\r\nbut to the character of the men who control it--men who are not, as in\r\neighteenth-century France, mere figureheads, but the real directors of\r\nthe Order. Should the control ever pass into the wrong hands and the\r\nagents of secret societies succeed in capturing a number of the lodges,\r\nthis great stabilizing force might become a gigantic engine of\r\ndestruction. How insidiously these efforts are being made we shall see\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nSECRET SOCIETIES IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that from the Illuminati onwards subversive societies have\r\nalways sought recruits amongst orthodox Freemasons. The reason for this\r\nis obvious: not only do the doctrines of Freemasonry lend themselves to\r\nperversion, but the training provided in the Lodges makes an admirable\r\npreparation for initiation into other secret systems. The man who has\r\nlearnt to maintain silence even on what may appear to him as\r\ntrivialities, who is willing to submit to mystification, to ask no\r\nquestions, and to recognize the authority of superiors whom he is in no\r\nway legally obliged to obey, who has, moreover, become imbued with the\r\n_esprit de corps_ which binds him to his fellow-members in a common\r\ncause, is naturally a better subject for the secret society adept than\r\nthe free lance who is liable to assert his independence at any moment.\r\nPerhaps the most important factor, however, is the nature of the masonic\r\noaths. These terrible penalties, which many Freemasons themselves regret\r\nas a survival of barbarism and which have in fact been abolished in the\r\nhigher degrees, have done much to create prejudice against Freemasonry,\r\nwhilst at the same time they provide an additional incentive to outside\r\nintriguers. In the opinion of M. Copin Albancelli, the abolition of the\r\noath would go far to prevent penetration of British Masonry by the\r\nsecret societies.\r\n\r\nNow, by their obligations British Freemasons are forbidden to join these\r\nirregular societies, not only because their principles are in conflict\r\nwith those of orthodox Masonry, but because in most cases they admit\r\nwomen. According to the ruling of Grand Lodge, \"any member working under\r\nthe English Jurisdiction ... violates his Obligation by being present at\r\nor assisting in assemblies professing to be Masonic which are attended\r\nby women.\" Warnings to this effect have been frequently given in the\r\nLodges; on September 3, 1919, the Board of General Purposes issued the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\n     The Board's attention is being increasingly drawn to sedulous\r\n     endeavours which are being made by certain bodies unrecognized as\r\n     Masonic by the United Grand Lodge of England, to induce Freemasons\r\n     to join in their assemblies. As all such bodies which admit women\r\n     to membership are clandestine and irregular, it is necessary to\r\n     caution Brethren against being inadvertently led to violate their\r\n     Obligation by becoming members of them or attending their meetings.\r\n     Grand Lodge, nine years since, approved the action of the Board in\r\n     suspending from all Masonic rights and privileges two Brethren who\r\n     had contumaciously failed to explain the grave Masonic irregularity\r\n     to which attention is now again called; and it is earnestly hoped\r\n     that no occasion will arise for having again to institute\r\n     disciplinary proceedings of a like kind.\r\n\r\nThe idea of women Masons is, of course, not a new one. As early as 1730\r\nlodges for women are said to have existed in France, and towards the end\r\nof the century several excellent women, such as the Duchesse de Bourbon\r\nand the Princesse de Lamballe, played a leading part in the Order. But\r\nthis _Maçonnerie d'Adoption_, as it was called, retained a purely\r\nconvivial character; a sham ceremonial, with symbols, pass words, and a\r\nritual, was devised as a consolation to the members for their exclusion\r\nfrom the real lodges. These mummeries were, as Ragon observes, \"only the\r\npretexts for assemblies; the real objects were the banquet and the ball,\r\nwhich were their inevitable accompaniments.\"[694]\r\n\r\nBut this precedent, inaugurated as a society pastime and accompanied by\r\nall the frivolity of the age, paved the way for Weishaupt's two classes\r\nof women members, who, although never initiated into the secrets of the\r\nOrder, were to act as useful tools \"directed by men without knowing it.\"\r\nFor this purpose they were to be divided into two classes, the\r\n\"virtuous\" to play the part of figureheads or decoys, and the\r\n\"freer-hearted,\" who were to carry out the real designs of the Order.\r\n\r\nThe same plan was adopted nearly a hundred years later by Weishaupt's\r\ndisciple Bakunin, who, however, did admit women as actual initiates into\r\nhis secret society, the Alliance Sociale Démocratique, but, like\r\nWeishaupt, divided them into classes. The sixth category of people to be\r\nemployed in the work of social revolution is thus described in his\r\nprogramme:\r\n\r\n     The sixth category is very important. They are the women, who must\r\n     be divided into three classes: the first, frivolous women, without\r\n     mind or heart, which we must use in the same manner as the third\r\n     and fourth categories of men [i.e. by \"getting hold of their dirty\r\n     secrets and making them our slaves\"]; the second, the ardent,\r\n     devoted and capable women, but who are not ours because they have\r\n     not reached a practical revolutionary understanding, without\r\n     phrase--we must make use of these like the men of the fifth\r\n     category [i.e. by \"drawing them incessantly into practical and\r\n     perilous manifestations, which will result in making the majority\r\n     of them disappear while making some of them genuine\r\n     revolutionaries\"]; finally, the women who are entirely with us,\r\n     that is to say completely initiated and having accepted our\r\n     programme in its entirety. We ought to consider them as the most\r\n     precious of our treasures, without whose help we can do\r\n     nothing.[695]\r\n\r\nThe first and only woman to be admitted into real Masonry, if such a\r\nterm can be applied to so heterogeneous a system, was Maria Deraismes,\r\nan ardent French Feminist celebrated for her political speeches and\r\nelectioneering campaigns in the district of Pontoise and for twenty-five\r\nyears the acknowledged leader of the anti-clerical and Feminist\r\nparty.[696] In 1882 Maria Deraismes was initiated into Freemasonry by\r\nthe members of the Lodge _Les Libres Penseurs_, deriving from the Grande\r\nLoge Symbolique Écossaise and situated at Pecq in the Department of\r\nSeine-et-Oise. The proceeding being, however, entirely unconstitutional,\r\nMaria Deraismes's initiation was declared by the Grande Loge to be null\r\nand void and the Lodge _Les Libres Penseurs_ was disgraced.[697] But\r\nsome years afterwards Dr. George Martin, an enthusiastic advocate of\r\nvotes for women, collaborated with Maria Deraismes in founding the\r\n_Maçonnerie Mixte_ at the first lodge of the Order named \"Le Droit\r\nHumain.\" The _Suprême Conseil Universel Mixte_ was founded in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe Maçonnerie Mixte was political and in no way theosophical or occult,\r\nand its programme, like that of the Grand Orient, was Utopian Socialism,\r\nwhilst by its insistence on the supremacy of reason it definitely\r\nproclaimed its antagonism to all revealed religion. Thus in the involved\r\nlanguage of Dr. George Martin himself:\r\n\r\n     The Ordre Maçonnique Mixte Internationale is the first mixed,\r\n     philosophic, progressive, and philanthropic Masonic Power to be\r\n     organized and constituted in the world, placed above all the\r\n     prooccupations of the philosophical or religious ideas which may be\r\n     professed by those who ask to become members.... The Order wishes\r\n     to interest itself principally in the vital interests of the human\r\n     being on earth; it wishes above all to study in its Temples the\r\n     means for realizing Peace between all nations and social Justice\r\n     which will enable all human beings to enjoy during their lives the\r\n     greatest possible sum of moral felicity and of material\r\n     well-being.... Claiming no divine revelation and loudly affirming\r\n     that it is only an emanation of human reason, this fraternal\r\n     institution is not dogmatic, it is rationalist.[698]\r\n\r\nInto this materialist and political club, erected under the guise of\r\nFreemasonry, entered Annie Besant with all the strange conglomeration of\r\nEastern doctrines now known as Theosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheosophy\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering on this question it is necessary to make my own position\r\nclear. Although I should much prefer not to introduce a personal note\r\ninto the discussion, I feel that nothing I say will carry any weight if\r\nit appears to be an expression of opinion by one who has never\r\nconsidered religious doctrines from anything but the orthodox Christian\r\npoint of view. I should explain, then, that I have known Theosophists\r\nfrom my early youth, that I have travelled in India, Ceylon, Burma, and\r\nJapan and seen much to admire in the great religions of the East. I do\r\nnot believe that God has revealed Himself to one portion of mankind\r\nalone and that during only the last 1,900 years of the world's history;\r\nI do not accept the doctrine that all the millions of human beings who\r\nhave never heard of Christ are plunged in spiritual darkness; I believe\r\nthat behind all religions founded on a law of righteousness there lies a\r\ndivine and central truth, that Ikhnaton, Moses and Isaiah, Socrates and\r\nEpictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Zoroaster, and Mohammed were all\r\nteachers who interpreted to men the aspect of the divine as it had been\r\nvouchsafed to them and which in harmony with the supreme revelation\r\ngiven to man by Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nThis conception of an affinity between all great religious faiths was\r\nbeautifully expressed by an old Mohammedan to a friend of the present\r\nwriter with whom he stood watching a Hindu procession pass through an\r\nIndian village. In answer to the Englishman's enquiry, \"What do you\r\nthink of this?\" the Mohammedan replied:\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, sahib, we cannot tell. We know of three roads up the hill of\r\n     endeavour to the gates of Paradise--the way of Mousa [Moses], the\r\n     way of Issa [Jesus], and the way of Mahmoud, and there may be other\r\n     roads of which you and I know nothing. I was born in the way of\r\n     Mahmoud, and I believe it to be the best and the easiest to follow,\r\n     and you were born in the way of Issa. And of this I am very sure:\r\n     that if you will follow your guide on your road and I follow my\r\n     guide on my road, when we have climbed the hill of endeavour, we\r\n     shall salute one another again at the gates of Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nIf, then, in the following pages I attempt to show the errors of\r\nTheosophy, it is not because I do not recognize that there is much that\r\nis good and beautiful in the ancient religions from which it professes\r\nto derive.\r\n\r\nBut what is Theosophy? The word, as we have already seen, was used in\r\nthe eighteenth century to denote the theory of the Martinists; it was\r\nknown two centuries earlier when Haselmeyer in 1612 wrote of \"the\r\nlaudable Fraternity of the Theosophists of the Rosy Cross.\" According to\r\nColonel Olcott, who with Madame Blavatsky founded the modern\r\nTheosophical Society in New York in 1875, the word was discovered by one\r\nof the members \"in turning over the leaves of a Dictionary\" and\r\nforthwith unanimously adopted.[699] Madame Blavatsky had arrived in\r\nAmerica two years earlier, before which date she professed to have been\r\ninitiated into certain esoteric doctrines in Thibet. Monsieur Guénon,\r\nwho writes with inside knowledge of the movement, indicates, however,\r\nthe existence of concealed superiors on the Continent of Europe by whom\r\nshe was in reality directed.\r\n\r\n     What is very significant ... is that Madame Blavatsky in 1875 wrote\r\n     this: \"I have been sent from Paris to America in order to verify\r\n     phenomena and their reality and to show the deception of the\r\n     Spiritualist theory.\" Sent by whom? Later she will say: by the\r\n     \"Mahatmas\"; but then there was no question of them, and besides it\r\n     was in Paris that she received her mission, and not in India or in\r\n     Thibet.[700]\r\n\r\nElsewhere Monsieur Guénon observes that it is very doubtful whether\r\nMadame Blavatsky was ever in Thibet at all. These obvious attempts at\r\nconcealment lead Monsieur Guénon therefore to the conclusion that in the\r\nbackground of Theosophy there existed a mysterious centre of direction,\r\nthat Madame Blavatsky was simply \"an instrument in the hands of\r\nindividuals or occult groups sheltering behind her personality,\" and\r\nthat \"those who believe she invented everything, that she did everything\r\nby herself and on her own initiative, are as much mistaken as those who,\r\non the contrary, believe her affirmations concerning her relations with\r\nthe pretended Mahatmas.\"[701]\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to believe that the people under whom Madame\r\nBlavatsky was working at this date in Paris were Serapis Bey and Tuiti\r\nBey, who belonged to \"the Egyptian Brothers.\" This might answer M.\r\nGuénon's question: \"By whom was she sent to America?\" But another\r\npassage from Madame Blavatsky's writings, on the person of Christ, that\r\nM. Guénon quotes later, indicates a further source of inspiration: \"For\r\nme, Jesus Christ, that is to say the Man-God of the Christians, copy of\r\nthe Avatars of all countries, of the Hindu Chrishna as of the Egyptian\r\nHorus, was never a _historical_ personage.\" Hence the story of His life\r\nwas merely an allegory founded on the existence of \"a personage named\r\nJehoshua born at Lud.\" But elsewhere she asserted that Jesus may have\r\nlived during the Christian era or a century earlier \"_as the Sepher\r\nToldoth Jehoshua indicates_\" (my italics). And Madame Blavatsky went on\r\nto say of the savants who deny the historical value of this legend, that\r\nthey--\r\n\r\n     either lie or talk nonsense. _It is our Masters who affirm it_ [my\r\n     italics]. If the history of Jehoshua or Jesus Ben Pandera is false,\r\n     then the whole of the Talmud, the whole of the Jewish canon law, is\r\n     false. It was the disciple of Jehoshua Ben Parachia, the fifth\r\n     President of the Sanhedrim since Ezra, who re-wrote the Bible....\r\n     This story is much truer than that of the New Testament, of which\r\n     history does not say a word.[702]\r\n\r\nWho were the Masters whose authority Madame Blavatsky here invokes?\r\nClearly not the Trans-Himalayan Brotherhood to whom she habitually\r\nrefers by this term, and who can certainly not be suspected of affirming\r\nthe authenticity of the Toldoth Yeshu. It is evident, then, that there\r\nwere other \"Masters\" from whom Madame Blavatsky received this teaching,\r\nand that those other masters were Cabalists.\r\n\r\nThe same Judaic influence appears more strongly in a book published by\r\nthe Theosophical Society in 1903, where the Talmud and the Toledot Yeshu\r\nare quoted at great length and the Christians are derided for resenting\r\nthe attacks on their faith contained in these books, whilst the Jews are\r\nrepresented as innocent, persecuted victims. One passage will suffice to\r\ngive an idea of the author's point of view:\r\n\r\n     The Christ [said the mystics] was born \"of a virgin\"; the unwitting\r\n     believer in Jesus as _the_ historical Messiah in the exclusive\r\n     Jewish sense, and in his being _the_ Son of God, nay God Himself,\r\n     in course of time asserted that Mary was that virgin; whereupon\r\n     Rabbinical logic, which in this case was simple and common logic,\r\n     met this extravagance by the natural retort that, seeing that his\r\n     paternity was unacknowledged, Jesus was therefore illegitimate, a\r\n     bastard [_mamzer_].[703]\r\n\r\nIt is obviously, then, less from Thibetan Mahatmas, Hindu Swamis, Sikh\r\nGurus, or Egyptian Brothers than from Jewish Cabalists that these\r\nleaders of Theosophy have borrowed their ideas on Jesus Christ. As the\r\nJewish writer Adolphe Franck has truly observed: \"Dès qu'il est question\r\nde théosophie, on est sûr de voir apparaître la Kabbale.\"[704] And he\r\ngoes on to show the direct influence of Cabalism on the modern\r\nTheosophical Society.\r\n\r\nMrs. Besant, without endorsing the worst blasphemies of the Toledot\r\nYeshu, nevertheless reflected this and other Judaic traditions in her\r\nbook _Esoteric Christianity_, where she related that Jesus was brought\r\nup amongst the Essenes, and that later He went to Egypt, where He became\r\nan initiate of the great esoteric lodge--that is to say, the Great White\r\nLodge--from which all great religions derive. It will be seen that this\r\nis only a version of the old story of the Talmudists and Cabalists,\r\nperpetuated by the Gnostics, the Rosicrucians, and the\r\nnineteenth-century _Ordre du Temple_.[705] But according to one of Mrs.\r\nBesant's Theosophical antagonists, her doctrine \"rests on a perpetual\r\nequivocation,\" and whilst allowing the English public to believe that\r\nwhen she spoke of the coming Christ she referred to the Christ of the\r\nGospels, she stated to her intimates what Mr. Leadbeater taught in his\r\nbook _The Inner Life_, namely, that the Christ of the Gospels never\r\nexisted, but was an invention of the monks of the second century.[706]\r\nIt should be understood, however, that in the language of the\r\nTheosophists, led by Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater, Jesus and \"the\r\nChrist\" are two separate and distinct individualities, and that when\r\nthey now speak of \"the Christ\" they refer to someone living in a\r\nbungalow in the Himalayas with whom Mr. Leadbeater has interviews to\r\narrange about his approaching advent.[707] Portraits of this person have\r\nbeen distributed amongst the members of \"The Star in the East,\" an Order\r\nfounded at Benares in 1911 by Mr. Leadbeater and J. Krishnamurti for the\r\npurpose of preparing the world for the coming of the Great Teacher.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to return to the alliance between Theosophy and the\r\nMaçonnerie Mixte. Whether Mrs. Besant, who had begun her career as a\r\nFreethinker, retained some lingering belief in her earlier creed at the\r\ntime she entered into relations with the Order, or whether she saw in\r\nthis materialistic society a valuable concrete organization for the\r\ndissemination of her new esoteric theories, it is impossible to know. At\r\nany rate, she rose rapidly through the succeeding degrees and became\r\nbefore long Vice President of the _Suprême Conseil_, which appointed her\r\nits national delegate to Great Britain. It was in this capacity that she\r\nfounded the English branch of the Order under the name of Co-Masonry\r\n(that is, admitting both sexes) at the Lodge \"Human Duty\" in London,\r\nwhich was consecrated on September 26, 1902, and later founded another\r\nlodge at Adyar in India, named \"The Rising Sun.\" The number of lodges on\r\nthe Grand Roll of Co-Masonry, including those abroad, is now said to be\r\nno less than 442.\r\n\r\nCo-Masonry thus receives a two-fold direction, for whilst remaining in\r\nconstant correspondence with the _Suprême Conseil Universel Mixte_,\r\nsituated at 5 Rue Jules-Breton in Paris and presided over by the Grand\r\nMaster Piron, with Madame Amélie Gédalje, thirty-third degree, as Grand\r\nSecretary-General, it receives further instructions from \"the V∴ Ill∴\r\nBro∴ Annie Besant 33°\" at Adyar. In order not to shock the\r\nsusceptibilities of English adepts who might be repelled by the\r\nrationalist tendencies of the Maçonnerie Mixte, Mrs. Besant has,\r\nhowever, borrowed the formulas of British Masonry together with its\r\ncustom of placing the V.S.L. on the table in the lodges. These\r\nconflicting doctrines are blended in an amusing manner on the\r\ncertificates of the Order, where at the top we find the French motto and\r\ninitials:\r\n\r\n               Liberté Égalité Fraternité\r\n                    À∴ L∴ G∴ D∴ L'H∴\r\n            (i.e. à la gloire de l'Humanité)\r\n\r\nand below, for the benefit of English members, the initials of the\r\nBritish masonic device, that does not of course appear on the diplomas\r\nof the French Order, which, like the Grand Orient, has rejected the\r\nGreat Architect:\r\n\r\n                  T∴ T∴ G∴ O∴ T∴ G∴ A∴ O∴ T∴ U∴\r\n       (To the glory of the Great Architect of the Universe).\r\n\r\nOur Co-Masons therefore enjoy the advantage of being able to choose\r\nwhether they shall render glory to God or to Humanity. That the two\r\ndevices are somewhat incompatible does not appear to strike the English\r\ninitiates, nor do they probably realize the imposture practised on them\r\nby the further wording of the certificate, which, after announcing in\r\nimposing capitals \"To all Masons dispersed over both Hemispheres,\r\nGreeting,\" goes on to say \"We therefore recommend him (_or_ her) as such\r\nto all Freemasons of the Globe, requesting them to recognize him (_or_\r\nher) in all the rights and privileges attached to this Degree, as we\r\nwill do to all presenting themselves under similar circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nNow, any British Mason will see at a glance that all this is a false\r\npretension. No order of Masonry can recommend its members for rights and\r\nprivileges to \"all the Freemasons of the world,\" for the simple reason\r\nthat, as has been said, there is no such thing as \"Universal Masonry,\"\r\nso that even Grand Lodge of England--the most important Lodge in the\r\nworld--could not, if it would, accord the right of entry for its members\r\ninto Continental lodges. As an English Mason recently expressed it:\r\n\r\n     The impression among non-Masons generally appears to be that a\r\n     British or Irish member of the Craft is able to enter a masonic\r\n     lodge in any part of the world and take part in its deliberations\r\n     and proceedings. To this belief an unqualified denial may at once\r\n     be given. Nor may a member of a lodge under any Jurisdiction not\r\n     in communion with the Grand Lodges of the United Kingdom be\r\n     received as a visitor or as a Joining Member in any subsidiary\r\n     lodge of the Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, or Scotland.[708]\r\n\r\nBut for Co-Masonry to make this claim is even more ridiculous, since at\r\nthe time when the above quoted diploma was drawn up Co-Masonry and its\r\nparent, the Maçonnerie Mixte, were not recognized by any other order of\r\nMasonry except the \"Droit Humain,\" and it is not only unrecognized but\r\nutterly repudiated by Grand Lodge of England. The British Mason, in\r\nfact, does not recognize the Co-Mason as a Mason at all, and would\r\nviolate his obligations by discussing masonic secrets with him or her,\r\nso that there is no manner in which the Co-Mason could be accorded\r\nmasonic rights and privileges by British Masons. In order, further, to\r\nkeep up the illusion in the minds of its members that they are genuine\r\nMasons, Co-Masonry, in its quarterly organ, _The Co-Mason_, is careful\r\nto include masonic news relating to British Masonry as if it formed one\r\nand the same order.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Grand Orient, an equally tortuous policy was pursued.\r\nAs we have already seen, the Grande Loge disgraced the lodge that had\r\nadmitted Maria Deraismes and did not officially recognize the Maçonnerie\r\nMixte. The ritual adopted by the latter Order was, however, not that of\r\nBritish Masonry, and in most Co-Masonic Lodges the ritual employed\r\ncontains variations derived from the Grand Orient[709]; indeed the Grand\r\nOrient character of Co-Masonry has always been generally recognized in\r\nmasonic circles. This being so, I pointed out in _World Revolution_ that\r\nCo-Masonry derives from the Grand Orient, but I received the following\r\nprotest from a woman Co-Mason:\r\n\r\n     Are you aware that for twenty years the Grand Orient has refused to\r\n     recognize it [Co-Masonry] as a legitimate body, just as the English\r\n     Orthodox Masons do now? Also, we are distinctly told before joining\r\n     that we shall not be recognized by that body. Also, we have nothing\r\n     to do with Illuminati, or with Germany. As the Grand Orient have\r\n     eliminated the Deity, it is rather a dreadful thing to a Mason to\r\n     be connected in any way with that Order, and I cannot imagine a\r\n     worse thing could be said about us.\r\n\r\nThis letter was dated March 6, 1922, and on the 19th of the preceding\r\nmonth of February an alliance between the Grand Orient and Co-Masonry\r\nhad been finally celebrated at the Grand Temple of the Droit Humain in\r\nParis! We find a report of this ceremony in the _Co-Mason_ for the\r\nfollowing April. It is evident, therefore, that members who were likely\r\nto be repelled by the idea of connexion with the Grand Orient were\r\nassured that no such connexion existed. But when this covert _liaison_\r\ndeveloped into official recognition--although this did not include the\r\nright of entry to the lodges of the Grand Orient for women members--the\r\ntriumphant manner in which the great event was announced in the\r\n_Co-Mason_ suggests that the majority of members were likely to feel\r\nnothing but satisfaction at association with the Order that \"had\r\neliminated the Deity.\" It is true that a few members protested, and by\r\nthis time Co-Masonry was too completely under the control of Mrs. Besant\r\nfor any faction to question her dictates. Moreover, the opposition had\r\nbeen weakened by a schism which took place in the Order in 1908, when a\r\nnumber of members who objected to the introduction of Eastern occultism\r\ninto Masonry and likewise disapproved of the Grand Orient, formed\r\nthemselves into a separate body under Mrs. Halsey and Dr. Geikie Cobb,\r\nworking only the Craft Degrees according to the Grand Lodge of England.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by this brief résumé that Co-Masonry is a hybrid\r\nsystem deriving from two conflicting sources--the political and\r\nrationalist doctrines of the _Maçonnerie Mixte_ and the Eastern\r\noccultism of Madame Blavatsky and Mrs. Besant.\r\n\r\nAs a professing Buddhist, Madame Blavatsky consistently dissociated\r\nherself from any schemes of material welfare. Thus in the early\r\nConstitution of the Theosophical Society it is stated:\r\n\r\n     \"The Society repudiates all interference on its behalf with the\r\n     Governmental relations of any nation or community, confining its\r\n     attention exclusively to the matters set forth in the present\r\n     document.\"[710]\r\n\r\nThese matters relate to the study of Occult Sciences. Again Madame\r\nBlavatsky herself wrote in the _Theosophist_:\r\n\r\n     Unconcerned about politics: hostile to the insane dreams of\r\n     Socialism and Communism, which it abhors--as both are but disguised\r\n     conspiracies of brutal force and selfishness against honest\r\n     labour; the Society cares but little about the outward human\r\n     management of the material world. The whole of its aspirations are\r\n     directed towards the occult truths of the visible and invisible\r\n     worlds.[711]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this declaration is diametrically opposed to that\r\nof the Maçonnerie Mixte. Nevertheless, Madame Blavatsky so far departed\r\nfrom her purely occult programme after her arrival in India in 1879 as\r\nto reconstruct the society on the basis of \"Universal Brotherhood.\" This\r\nidea was completely absent from her first scheme; \"the Brotherhood plank\r\nin the Society's future platform,\" wrote her coadjutor Colonel Olcott,\r\n\"was not thought of.\"[712] It was over this plank, however, that Mrs.\r\nBesant was able to walk to the Supreme Council of the Maçonnerie Mixte,\r\nand adding Liberty and Equality to the principle of Fraternity to\r\nestablish Co-Masonry on a definitely political basis as a preparation\r\nfor the Socialist doctrines her teacher had \"abhorred.\"\r\n\r\nIn the matter of esoteric doctrines Mrs. Besant again departed from the\r\npath laid down by Madame Blavatsky, whose aim had been to rehabilitate\r\nBuddhism in India, representing the teachings of Gautama Buddha as an\r\nadvance on Hinduism.[713] Mrs. Besant, however, came to regard the\r\ndoctrines of the Brahmins as the purer faith. Yet it was neither\r\nBuddhism nor Hinduism in a pure form that she introduced to the\r\nCo-Masons of the West, but an occult system of her own devising, wherein\r\nMahatmas, Swamis, and Gurus were incongruously mingled with the\r\ncharlatans of eighteenth-century France. Thus in the Co-Masonic lodges\r\nwe find \"the King\" inscribed over the Grand Master's chair in the East,\r\nin the North the empty chair of \"the Master\"--to which, until recently,\r\nall members were required to bow in passing--and over it a picture,\r\nveiled in some lodges, of the same mysterious personage. Should the\r\nneophyte enquire, \"Who is the King?\" he may be told that he is the King\r\nwho is to come from India--whether he is identical with the young Hindu\r\nKrishnamurti adopted by Mrs. Besant in 1909 is not clear--whilst the\r\nquestion \"Who is the Master?\" will probably be met with the reply that\r\nhe is \"the Master of all true Freemasons throughout the world,\" which\r\nthe enquirer takes to mean the head of the religion to which he happens\r\nto belong--Christ, Mohammed, or another. But in the third degree the\r\nastonishing information is confided with an appearance of great secrecy\r\nthat he is no other than the famous Comte de Saint-Germain, who did not\r\nreally die in 1784, but is still alive to-day in Hungary under the name\r\nof Ragocsky. In yet a higher degree, however, the initiate may be told\r\nthat the Master is in reality Prince Eugene of Austria.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to describe in detail the wild nonsense that\r\ncomposes the creed of Co-Masonry, since a long series of articles was\r\nrecently devoted to the subject in _The Patriot_ and can be consulted by\r\nanyone who desires information concerning its ceremonies and the\r\npersonnel directing it.[714] Suffice it to say here that its course,\r\nlike that of most secret societies, has been marked by violent\r\ndissensions amongst the members--the Blavatsky-ites passionately\r\ndenouncing the Besantites and the Besantites proclaiming the divine\r\ninfallibility of their leader--whilst at the same time scandals of a\r\npeculiarly unsavoury kind have been brought to light. This fact has\r\nindeed created a serious schism in the ranks of the Theosophists, which\r\nshows that a number of perfectly harmless people are to be found amongst\r\nthem. Yet the peculiar recurrence of such scandals in the history of\r\nsecret societies leads one inevitably to wonder how far these are to be\r\nregarded as merely deplorable accidents or as the results of\r\nsecret-society methods and of occult teaching. That the men against whom\r\ncharges of sexual perversion were brought were not isolated examples of\r\nthese tendencies is shown by a curious admission on the part of one of\r\nMadame Blavatsky's \"chelas,\" or disciples, who relates:\r\n\r\n     I was a pupil of H.P.B. before Mrs. Besant joined the T.S. and saw\r\n     her expel one of her most gifted and valued workers from the\r\n     Esoteric Section for offences against the occult and moral law,\r\n     similar to those with which Mr. Leadbeater's name has now been\r\n     associated for nearly twenty years. H.P.B. was always extremely\r\n     strict on this particular point, and _many_ [my itals.] would-be\r\n     aspirants for chelaship were refused on this one ground alone,\r\n     while others who had been accepted \"on probation\" failed almost\r\n     immediately afterwards.[715]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that these deplorable proclivities are peculiarly\r\nprevalent amongst aspirants to Theosophical knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to enlarge at length on Mrs. Besant's connexion with\r\nthe seditious elements in this country and in India, since these have\r\nfrequently been referred to in the press. It is true that the\r\nTheosophical Society, like the Grand Orient, disavows all political\r\nintentions and professes to work only for spiritual development, but the\r\nleaders appear to consider that a radical change must take place in the\r\nexisting social system before true spiritual development can be\r\nattained. That this change would lie in the direction of Socialism is\r\nsuggested by the fact that a group of leading Theosophists, including\r\nMrs. Besant, were discovered in 1919 to be holding a large number of\r\nshares in the Victoria House Printing Company, which was financing the\r\n_Daily Herald_ at that date[716]; indeed, Mrs. Besant in her lectures on\r\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, at the Queen's Hall in October of the\r\nsame year, clearly indicated Socialism as the system of the coming New\r\nEra.[717] Since then the \"Action Lodge\" has been founded with the object\r\nof carrying \"Theosophical ideals and conceptions into all fields of\r\nhuman activity\"[718]--from which the political field appears not to be\r\nexcluded, since this lodge has been known to co-operate with the\r\npromoters of a political meeting on the Indian question.[719] It is\r\ninteresting to notice that a leading member of the \"Action Lodge,\" and\r\nalso of the \"Order of the Star in the East,\" was recently reported in\r\nthe press to have been long connected with the Labour Party and to have\r\nnotified her intention of standing for it in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, not to say that all Theosophists are Socialists. The\r\nTheosophical Society of America, in an admirable series of articles[720]\r\ndiscussing the theory of world-revolution set forth in my books, pointed\r\nout that:\r\n\r\n     The pupils of the powers of evil work ... untiringly to thwart\r\n     every real advance of the human race, to pull down whatever\r\n     civilization painfully builds, that makes for light and true\r\n     development and spiritual growth.... It would not be difficult to\r\n     suggest reasons why these pupils and co-workers of the powers of\r\n     darkness choose the chief clauses of their creed: Internationalism,\r\n     Communism, the destruction of the higher class through the despotic\r\n     rule of the lowest class, the corruption of family life. The attack\r\n     on religion hardly needs comment.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that Socialism and Internationalism are not an\r\nessential part of Theosophical teaching, and that the more enlightened\r\nTheosophists recognize the danger of these destructive doctrines. At a\r\nSpecial Convention in England on April 6 of this year, seven Lodges\r\nentered a protest against recent departures from the original policy of\r\nthe Society. Amongst the resolutions put forward was one urging the\r\nPresident (Mrs. Besant) to establish a tribunal \"to investigate matters\r\naffecting the good name of the Society, and the conduct of certain\r\nmembers\"; this was lost by \"an overwhelming majority.\" Another\r\nresolution regretted that \"the Administration, the Magazine, and the\r\ninfluence of the Society have been used for controversial political ends\r\nand sectarian religious propaganda.\" Unhappily these resolutions were\r\nnot met in the fraternal spirit that might be expected from a Society\r\nsetting out to establish Universal Brotherhood and were stigmatized in a\r\nproposed amendment as \"destructive motions ... at variance with the\r\nobjects for which the Society stands.\" This clause in the amendment was\r\nlost by a small majority, but a very large majority supported the\r\nfurther clauses in which the Special Convention affirmed \"its complete\r\nconfidence in the administration of the Society and its beloved and\r\nrevered President Dr. Annie Besant, the chosen leader of whom it is\r\njustly proud,\" and sent \"its cordial greetings to Bishop Leadbeater,\r\nF.T.S.,\" thanking him \"for his invaluable work and his unswerving\r\ndevotion to the cause of Theosophy and the service of the Theosophical\r\nSociety.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, then, a certain number of Theosophists in this country who\r\nhave the courage and public spirit to protest against the use of the\r\nSociety for political ends and against infractions of the moral code\r\nwhich they believe certain members to have committed. But this party\r\nunfortunately constitutes only a small minority; the rest are prepared\r\nto render blind and unquestioning obedience to the dictates of Mrs.\r\nBesant and Mr. Leadbeater. In this respect the Theosophical Society\r\nfollows the usual plan of secret societies. For although not nominally a\r\nsecret society it is one in effect, being composed of outer and inner\r\ncircles and absolutely controlled by supreme directors. The inner\r\ncircle, known as the Esoteric Section, or rather the Eastern School of\r\nTheosophy--usually referred to as the E.S.--is in reality a secret\r\nsociety, consisting in its turn of three further circles, the innermost\r\ncomposed of the Mahatmas or Masters of the White Lodge, the second of\r\nthe Accepted Pupils or Initiates, and the third of the Learners or\r\nordinary members. The E.S. and Co-Masonry thus compose two secret\r\nsocieties within the open order controlled by people who are frequently\r\nmembers of both. Whether even these higher initiates are really in the\r\nsecret is another question. Dr. Weller van Hook who is said to have been\r\nalso a Rosicrucian and an important member of the Grand Orient once\r\ncryptically observed that \"Theosophy is not the hierarchy,\" implying\r\nthat it was only part of a world-organization, and darkly hinting that\r\nif it did not carry out the work allotted to it, the Rosicrucians would\r\ntake control. That this is more than probable we shall see later.\r\n\r\nThe outer ranks of the Theosophical Society seem to be largely composed\r\nof harmless enthusiasts who imagine that they are receiving genuine\r\ninstruction in the religions and occult doctrines of the East. That the\r\nteaching of the E.S. would not be taken seriously by any real\r\nOrientalist and that they could learn far more by studying the works of\r\nrecognized authorities on these subjects at a University or at the\r\nBritish Museum does not occur to them for a moment. Nor would this\r\nfulfil the purpose of the leaders. For the Theosophical Society is not a\r\nstudy group, but essentially a propagandist society which aims at\r\nsubstituting for the pure and simple teaching of Christianity the\r\namazing compound of Eastern superstition, Cabalism, and\r\neighteenth-century charlatanism which Mrs. Besant and her coadjutors\r\nhave devised. Yet even were the doctrines of Mrs. Besant those of true\r\nBuddhism or of Brahmanism, to what extent are they likely to benefit\r\nWestern civilization? Setting the question of Christianity aside,\r\nexperience shows that the attempt to orientalize Occidentals may prove\r\nno less disastrous than the attempt to occidentalize Orientals, and that\r\nto transport Eastern mysticism to the West is to vulgarize it and to\r\nproduce a debased form of occultism that frequently ends in moral\r\ndeterioration or mental derangement.[721] I attribute the scandals that\r\nhave taken place amongst Theosophists directly to this cause.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to turn to another society in which this debased\r\noccultism plays a still more important part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosicrucianism\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time, as in the eighteenth century, the term\r\n\"Rosicrucianism\" is used to cover a number of associations differing in\r\ntheir aims and doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe first of these societies to be founded in England was the _Societas\r\nRosicruciana in Anglia_, founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little on\r\ninstructions received from abroad. Only Master Masons are admitted--a\r\nprocedure not condemned by Grand Lodge of England, which regards the\r\nS.R.I.A. as a perfectly innocuous body. Although neither polical nor\r\nanti-Christian, but, on the contrary, containing distinctly Christian\r\nelements and claiming to descend from Christian Rosenkreutz--a claim\r\nwhich must be dismissed as an absurdity--the S.R.I.A. is nevertheless\r\nlargely Cabalistic,[722] dealing with the forces of Nature, alchemy,\r\netc. If its progenitors are really to be traced further back than the\r\nRosicrucians of the nineteenth century--Ragon, Eliphas Lévi, and Kenneth\r\nMackenzie--they must be sought amongst certain esoteric Masons in\r\nHungary and also amongst the French Martinistes, whose rituals doubtless\r\nderived from a kindred source. It will be remembered that Marlines\r\nPasqually bequeathed to his disciples a large number of Jewish\r\nmanuscripts which were presumably preserved in the archives of the\r\nMartiniste Lodge at Lyons. The Order of Martinistes has never ceased to\r\nexist, and the President of the Suprême Conseil, Dr. Gérard Encausse,\r\nwell known as \"Papus,\" an avowed Cabalist, only died in 1916. To these\r\narchives another famous Cabalist, the renegade Abbé, Alphonse Louis\r\nConstant, who assumed the name of Eliphas Lévi, may well have had\r\naccess. It is said that one of Eliphas Lévi's most distinguished\r\ndisciples, the occultist Baron Spedalieri of Marseilles, was a member of\r\nthe \"Grand Lodge of Solitary Brethren of the Mountain,\" an \"Illumined\r\nBrother of the Ancient Restored Order of Manicheans,\" a high member of\r\nthe Grand Orient, and also a \"High Illuminate of the Martinistes.\"\r\nBefore his death in 1875 Eliphas Lévi announced that in 1879 a new\r\npolitical and religious \"universal Kingdom\" would be established, and\r\nthat it would be possessed by \"him who would have the keys of the East.\"\r\nThe manuscript containing this prophecy was passed on by Baron\r\nSpedalieri to Edward Maitland, who in his turn gave it to a leading\r\nmember of S.R.I.A., by whom it was published in English.[723]\r\n\r\nBut, as we have already seen, the principal centre of Cabalism was in\r\nEastern Europe, whilst Germany was the principal home of Rosicrucianism,\r\nand it was from these directions that, a few years later, a new\r\nRosicrucian Order in England derived its inspiration. It is curious to\r\nnotice that the eighties of the last century were marked by a\r\nsimultaneous recrudescence of secret societies and of Socialist\r\norganizations. In 1880 Leopold Engel reorganized Weishaupt's Order of\r\nIlluminati, which, according to M. Guénon, played thenceforth \"an\r\nextremely suspect political rôle,\" and soon after this in 1884 it is\r\nsaid that a strange incident took place in London. The Rev. A.F.A.\r\nWoodford, a F∴ M∴, happened to be turning over the contents of a\r\nsecond-hand bookstall in Farringdon Street when he came upon some cypher\r\nMSS., attached to which was a letter in German saying that if the finder\r\nwere to communicate with Sapiens Dominabatur Astris, c/o Fraulein Anna\r\nSprengel, in Germany, he would receive further interesting information.\r\n\r\nThis, at any rate, is the story told to initiates of the Order which\r\ncame to be founded according to the instructions given in the cypher.\r\nBut when we remember that precisely the same story was told by\r\nCagliostro concerning his discovery of a MS. in London by the mysterious\r\nGeorge Cofton on which he had founded his Egyptian rite, we begin to\r\nwonder whether the placing of a MS. in a spot where it is certain to be\r\ndiscovered by precisely the people qualified to decipher it forms one of\r\nthe traditional methods of secret-society adepts for extending their\r\nsphere of influence without betraying their identity or revealing the\r\ncentre of direction.\r\n\r\nIn this case it certainly succeeded admirably, for by a fortunate\r\ncoincidence the clergyman who found the cypher MSS. was acquainted with\r\ntwo prominent members of the S.I.R.A., Dr. Wynn Westcott and Dr.\r\nWoodman, to whom he took the documents, and by a further fortunate\r\ncoincidence one of them happened to be the very person to whom Eliphas\r\nLévi's prophecy had been given; These two men who now assumed the\r\npseudonyms of S.A. (Sapere Aude) and M.E.V. (Magnus est Veritas), were\r\nable partially to decipher the manuscript; S.A., with the assistance of\r\na German, then wrote to S.D.A. c/o Fraulein Anna Sprengel, saying that\r\nhe and a friend had finished the deciphering and that they desired\r\nfurther information. In reply they were told to elaborate the notes, and\r\nthat if diligent they would be allowed to form an elementary branch of\r\nthe Rosicrucian Order in England. Finally S.D.A. wrote to S.A.\r\nauthorising him to sign her (or his?) name to any warrant or document\r\nnecessary for the constitution of an Order, and promising later on\r\nfurther rituals and advanced teachings if the preliminary Order proved\r\nsuccessful. S.A. and M.E.V. now called in the aid of a third member of\r\nthe S.I.R.A., Macgregor Mathers, henceforth known as D.D.C.F. (Deo Duce\r\nComite Ferro), who, having more time at his disposal, was able, by means\r\nof long and arduous labour, to elaborate the rituals in Masonic style.\r\nOn March 8, 1888, a warrant was then drawn up according to the design\r\ngiven in the cypher MSS. and was signed by S.A. for S.D.A., by M.E.V.\r\nand D.D.C.F., all three having received the honorary grade of 7-4 from\r\nS.D.A. so as to enable them to act as Chief of the New Temple. It is\r\ninteresting to note that whilst the instructions in the cypher MSS. were\r\nin English and German, the name now given to the new Order \"The Golden\r\nDawn,\" was accompanied by its equivalent in Hebrew \"Chebreth Zerech aur\r\nBokher\" that is to say \"The Companions of the Rising Light of the\r\nMorning.\" Amongst the instructions we find: \"Avoid Roman Catholics but\r\nwith pity\"; also these directions concerning the Obligation:\r\n\r\n     The candidate asking for Light is taken to the Altar and forced to\r\n     take an Obligation to secrecy under penalty of expulsion and death\r\n     or palsy from hostile current of will.\r\n\r\nFrom the subsequent correspondence of the Order it is seen that this\r\nso-called \"punitive current\" was actually directed by the Chiefs against\r\nthose who rebelled.\r\n\r\nAlthough the members of the Golden Dawn later became linked up with the\r\n\"Esoteric Masons\" in Germany, neither the organization nor the ritual of\r\nthe Order are masonic, but rather Martiniste and Cabalistic. For amidst\r\nall the confused phraseology of the Order, the phrases and symbols\r\nborrowed from Egyptian, Greek, or Hindu mythology, one detects the real\r\nbasis of the whole system--the Jewish Cabala, in which all the three\r\nChiefs were, or became, experts. Mathers in fact translated the famous\r\nbook of Abraham the Jew from French into English with explanatory notes,\r\nand Wynn Westcott translated the Sepher Yetzirah from Hebrew. Lectures\r\nwere given to the society on such subjects as the Tarot Cards, Geomantic\r\nTalismans, and the Schemhamphorasch or Tetragrammaton.\r\n\r\nThe Order was at first absolutely governed by the three Chiefs, but\r\nafter a time--owing to the death of Woodman and the resignation of Wynn\r\nWestcott--Mathers became the Sole Chief and professed to have obtained\r\nfurther instructions from the Hidden Chiefs through his wife--a sister\r\nof Bergson--by means of clairvoyance and clairaudience. But the real\r\ndirectors of the Order were in Germany and known as the \"Hidden and\r\nSecret Chiefs of the Third Order.\" A curious resemblance will here be\r\nnoted with the \"Concealed Superiors\" by whom members of the _Stricte\r\nObservance_ in the eighteenth century declared themselves to be\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\nWho these men were at the time the Order was founded remains a mystery\r\nnot only to the outside world but even to the English initiates\r\nthemselves. The identity of Sapiens Dominabatur Astris appears never to\r\nhave been established, nor was anything more heard about the still more\r\nmysterious Anna Sprengel until her death in an obscure German village\r\nwas reported in 1893. Indeed, one of the most active members of the\r\nOrder, Dr. Robert Felkin, M.D., known as F.R. (Finem Respice), later\r\ndeclared that, although he had visited five temples of the Order in\r\nGermany and Austria, he had been unable to get into touch with the\r\nHidden Chiefs, or to discover how the original MSS. came into the hands\r\nof the clergyman who handed them to Wynn Westcott and Woodman. According\r\nto Felkin's statement, all that he had been able to find out was that\r\nthe MSS. were the notes of ceremonies made by a man who had been\r\ninitiated into a Lodge in Germany, and that the temple from which they\r\noriginated was \"a special temple\" working on the Cabala tree like the\r\nEnglish branch of the Order. Further, he was told that none of the \"big\r\nThree\" who founded the Golden Dawn in England were real Rosicrucians at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe confusion of ideas which must inevitably result when, as in secret\r\nsocieties or revolutionary organizations, a number of people are being\r\nblindly led by hidden directors, naturally brought about dissensions\r\namongst the members, who mutually accused each other of ignorance of the\r\nreal aims of the Order. Thus the London Lodge ended by breaking with\r\nMathers, who was in Paris, on account of his arrogance in claiming\r\nsupreme power through the mystery of the Hidden Chiefs, and after two\r\nyears of unsettled government, in 1902 elected three new chiefs--Dr.\r\nFelkin (F.R. = Finem Respice), Bullock, a solicitor (L.O. = Levavi\r\nOculos) who resigned at the end of the year, and Brodie Innes (S.S.--Sub\r\nSpe). But although Mathers had been repudiated, his teachings were\r\nretained as emanating from the Hidden Chiefs.\r\n\r\nTwo years earlier a dramatic incident had occurred. In a very sinister\r\npersonage, Aleister Crowley, had been introduced into the Order on\r\nthe recommendation of A. E. Waite (S.R. = Sacramentum Regis) the\r\nwell-known mystical writer. A man of many aliases, Crowley followed the\r\nprecedent of the \"Comte de Saint-Germain,\" the \"Comte de Cagliostro,\"\r\nand the \"Baron von Offenbach\" by ennobling himself and masquerading\r\nunder various titles in turn, such as \"Count Svareff,\" \"Lord Boleskine,\"\r\n\"Baron Rosenkreutz,\" but usually known in the Order as \"P\" for\r\n\"Perdurabo.\"\r\n\r\nCrowley, who was a Cabalist, had written a book on Goetic Magic and soon\r\nafter becoming a member of the \"Golden Dawn\" set to work with another\r\n\"Frater\" on magical experiments, including evocations, the consecration\r\nand use of talismans, divination, alchemy, etc. In 1900 Crowley had\r\njoined Mathers in Paris where the latter and his wife were living under\r\nthe assumed names of the \"Comte and Comtesse of Glenstrae\" and engaged\r\nin reviving the mysteries of Isis at the Bodinière Theatre. In this task\r\nthey were joined by an extraordinary lady, the notorious Madame Horos\r\n(alias the Swami) who claimed to be the real and authentic Sapiens\r\nDominabatur Astris. Crowley described her as \"a very stout woman and\r\nvery fair\" and \"a vampire of remarkable power;\" Mathers declared her to\r\nbe \"probably the most powerful medium living,\" but later, in a letter to\r\nanother member of the \"Golden Dawn\" observed: \"I believe her and her\r\naccomplices to be emissaries of a very powerful _secret occult order_\r\nwho have been trying for years to break up other Orders and especially\r\nmy work.\" Incidentally this lady, who proved to be a false S.D.A., ended\r\nby starting an Order in collaboration with her husband, in which it was\r\nsaid that certain rituals of the Golden Dawn were adapted to an immoral\r\npurpose, with the result that the couple were brought to trial and\r\nfinally condemned to penal servitude.\r\n\r\nWhether owing to this disturbing experience, or because, as Crowley\r\ndeclared, he had \"imprudently attracted to himself forces of evil too\r\ngreat and terrible for him to withstand, presumably Abramelin demons,\"\r\nMathers' reason began to totter. This then was the situation at the time\r\nof his rupture with the Order, and the dramatic incident referred to was\r\nthe sudden appearance of Crowley in London, who, whether acting as\r\nMathers' envoy or on his own initiative, broke into the premises of the\r\nOrder, with a black mask over his face, a plaid shawl thrown over his\r\nshoulders, an enormous gold (or gilt) cross on his breast, and a dagger\r\nat his side, for the purpose of taking over possession. This attempt was\r\nbaffled with the prosaic aid of the police and Crowley was expelled from\r\nthe Order. Eventually, however, he succeeded in obtaining possession of\r\nsome of the rituals and other documents of the Golden Dawn, which he\r\nproceeded to publish in the organ of a new Order of his own. This\r\nmagazine, containing a mixture of debased Cabalism and vulgar\r\nblasphemies, interspersed with panegyrics on haschish--for Crowley\r\ncombined with sexual perversion an addiction to drugs--which might\r\nappear to express only the ravings of a maniac. But eccentricity has\r\noften provided the best cloak for dark designs, and the outbreak of war\r\nproved that there was a method in the madness of the man whom the\r\nauthorities persisted in regarding merely as an irresponsible degenerate\r\nof a non-political kind. To quote the press report of his exploits after\r\nthis date:\r\n\r\n     In November 1914 Crowley went to the United States, where he\r\n     entered into close relations with the pro-German propagandists. He\r\n     edited the New York _International_, a German propagandist paper\r\n     run by the notorious George Silvester Viereck, and published, among\r\n     other things, an obscene attack on the King and a glorification of\r\n     the Kaiser. Crowley ran occultism as a side-line, and seems to have\r\n     been known as the \"Purple Priest.\" Later on he publicly destroyed\r\n     his British passport before the Statute of Liberty, declared in\r\n     favour of the Irish Republican cause, and made a theatrical\r\n     declaration of \"war\" on England.... During his stay in America\r\n     Crowley was associated with a body known as the \"Secret\r\n     Revolutionary Committee\" which was working for the establishment of\r\n     an Irish Republic. He is known also as the writer of a defeatest\r\n     manifesto circulated in France in 1915.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Golden Dawn. In 1903 a split occurred in the Order.\r\nA.E. Waite, an early member of it, seceded from it with a number of\r\nother members and carried off with him the name of \"Golden Dawn,\" also\r\nthe vault and other property of the Order. The original Order then took\r\nthe name of \"Stella Matutina,\" with Dr. Felkin as Chief.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding year the members of the London Lodge had again believed\r\nthat they were in touch with the _Hidden Third Order_ and revived their\r\nefforts to communicate with the Secret Chiefs in Germany. This state of\r\nuncertainty continued till about 1910, when Felkin and Meakin set forth\r\nfor Germany, where they succeeded in meeting several members of the\r\nThird Order, who professed to be \"true and genuine Rosicrucians\" and to\r\nknow of Anna Sprengel and the starting of the Order in England. They\r\nwere not, it was believed, the Secret and Hidden Chiefs, but more\r\nprobably Esoteric Masons of the Grand Orient. These Fratres, however,\r\ntold them that in order to form a definite etheric link between\r\nthemselves and the Order in Great Britain, it would be necessary for a\r\nBritish Frater to be under their instruction for a year. Accordingly\r\nMeakin remained in Germany for special training, so that he might act as\r\nthe \"etheric link\" between the two countries. After a pilgrimage to the\r\nNear East, closely following the itinerary of Christian Rosenkreutz,\r\nMeakin returned to Germany, and it appears to have been now that he was\r\nable to get into touch with a certain high adept of occult science.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable personage, Rudolf Steiner, had earlier belonged to the\r\nTheosophical Society, and it has been suggested that at some period he\r\nmay have been connected with the revived Illuminati of Leopold Engel.\r\nThere is certainly some reason to believe that at one point in his\r\ncareer he came into touch with men who were carrying on the teachings of\r\nWeishaupt, the chief of whom was the President of a group of Pan-German\r\nsecret societies, and it seems not improbable that the mysterious\r\nS.D.A., under whose directions the Golden Dawn was founded, might be\r\nlocated in this circle.\r\n\r\nA few years before the war, Steiner, whilst still a Theosophist, started\r\na society of his own, the Anthroposophical Society, a name borrowed from\r\nthe work of the XVIIth century Rosicrucian, Thomas Vaughan,\r\n\"Anthroposophica Magica.\" The ostensible leader of Rosicrucianism in\r\nGermany was Dr. Franz Hartmann, founder of the \"Order of the Esoteric\r\nRose Croix.\" Although in some way connected with Engel's Illuminati and\r\nmore definitely with the Theosophical Society, Hartmann was believed to\r\nbe a genuine Christian mystic. Steiner also made the same profession,\r\nand it seems probable that he formed one of the group of mysterious\r\npersonages, including besides Grand Orient Masons, Baron von Knigge,\r\ngreat grandson of Weishaupt's coadjutor \"Philo,\" who met together in\r\nsecret conference at Ingoldstadt where the first Lodge of the Illuminati\r\nhad been founded in 1776, and decided to revive Illuminism on Christian\r\nmystic lines used in a very elastic sense amongst occultists. At the\r\nsame time Steiner introduces into his teaching a strong vein of\r\nGnosticism, Luciferianism, Johannism, and Grand Orient Masonry, whilst\r\nreserving Rosicrucianism for his higher initiates. On this last point he\r\nis extremely reticent, preferring to call his teaching \"occult science,\"\r\nsince he recognizes that \"real Rosicrucians never proclaim themselves as\r\nsuch\"; it is therefore only in the inner circle of his society, on which\r\nno information is given to the public and into which members are\r\nadmitted by much the same forms of initiation as those used by the Grand\r\nOrient, that Rosicrucianism is mentioned. Some of Steiner's imitators in\r\nThe Rosicrucian Fellowship at Oceanside, California, however, openly\r\nprofess what they call Rosicrucianism and at the same time claim\r\nsuperior knowledge on the subject of Masonry. Thus in a book by the\r\nleader of this group we find it solemnly stated that according to Max\r\nHeindl, Eve cohabited with serpents in the garden of Eden, that Cain was\r\nthe offspring of her union with \"the Lucifer Spirit Samael,\" and that\r\nfrom this \"divine progenitor\" the most virile portion of the human race\r\ndescended, the rest being merely the \"progeny of human parents.\" Readers\r\nof the present work will recognize this as not the legend of Masonry but\r\nof the Jewish Cabala which has been already quoted in this context.[724]\r\nWhether this also forms part of Steiner's teaching it is impossible to\r\nsay, since his real doctrines are known only to his inner circle; even\r\nsome of his admirers amongst the Steiner Matutina, whilst consulting him\r\nas an oracle, are not admitted to the secrets of his grades of\r\ninitiation and have been unable to succeed in obtaining from him a\r\ncharter. Meanwhile they themselves do not disclose to the neophytes whom\r\nthey seek to win over that they are members of any secret association.\r\nThis is quite in accordance with the methods of Weishaupt's \"Insinuating\r\nBrothers.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of what Steiner calls \"occult science\" is thus described in a\r\nstriking passage of one of his own works:\r\n\r\n\"This is the change which the occult student observes coming over\r\nhimself--that there is no longer a connection between a thought and a\r\nfeeling or a feeling and a volition, except when he creates the\r\nconnection himself. No impulse drives him from thought to action if he\r\ndoes not voluntarily harbour it. He can now stand completely without\r\nfeeling before an object which, before his training, would have filled\r\nhim with glowing love or violent hatred; he can likewise remain\r\nactionless before a thought which heretofore would have spurred him to\r\naction as if by itself,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI can imagine no clearer exposé of the dangers of occultism than this.\r\nWeishaupt had said: \"I cannot use men as I find them; I must form them.\"\r\nDr. Steiner shows how this transformation can be accomplished. Under the\r\ninfluence of so-called occult training, which is in reality simply\r\npowerful suggestion, all a man's native impulses and inhibitive springs\r\nof action may be broken; the pupil of the occultist will no longer react\r\nto the conceptions of beauty or ugliness, of right or wrong, which,\r\nunknown to himself, formed the law of his being. Thus not only his\r\nconscious deeds but his sub-conscious processes pass under the control\r\nof another. If this is indeed the method employed by Dr. Steiner and his\r\nadepts there would certainly seem to be some justification for the\r\nverdict of M. Robert Kuentz that \"Steiner has devised occult exercises\r\nwhich render the mind incapable (rendent l'esprit anéanti), that he\r\nattacks the individual by deranging his faculties (il détraque les\r\nfacultés).\"[725]\r\n\r\nWhat is the real motive power behind such societies as the Stella\r\nMatutina and again behind Steiner? This remains a mystery, not only to\r\nthe outside world but to the \"initiates\" themselves. The quest of the\r\nHidden Chiefs, undertaken by one intrepid pilgrim after another, seems\r\nto have ended only in further meetings with Steiner. Yet hope springs\r\neternal in the breast of the aspirant after occult knowledge, and astral\r\nmessages spurred the Fratres to further efforts. One of these contained\r\nthe exhortation: \"Go on with Steiner, which is not the ultimate end of\r\nsearch, and we will come into contact with many serious students who\r\nwill lead us to the real master of the Order, who will be so\r\noverpoweringly impressive as to leave no room for doubt.\"\r\n\r\nA curious analogy with Co-Masonry will here be observed. For whilst the\r\nveiled picture of the Co-Masonic lodges is said to represent \"the\r\nMaster\" in the person of Ragocsky or some other personage in Austria or\r\nHungary, so it is likewise in Austria and Germany that the members of\r\nStella Matutina seek their Hidden Chiefs and the \"real Master\" of their\r\nOrder. Moreover, whilst the Co-Masons await the coming of the great\r\n\"World Teacher,\" King, or Messiah in 1926, it is also in 1926 that the\r\nStella Matutina expect Christian Rosenkreutz to appear again.[726] There\r\nare many other points of resemblance between the phraseology of the two\r\nOrders, as, for example, the idea of the \"Astral Light,\" \"the Great\r\nWhite Lodge,\" and also \"the GREAT WORK\" by which both Orders denote the\r\nsupreme object of their aspirations--\"the union of the East and the\r\nWest.\" It is therefore impossible not to suspect that, although the\r\nmembers of Co-Masonry and of the Stella Matutina imagine their\r\nrespective Orders to be entirely unconnected and indeed appear to be\r\nhardly aware of each other's existence, there may be nevertheless some\r\npoint of junction in the background and even a common centre of\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion it is interesting to notice the political tendencies\r\nof the societies in question. Although the outcome of the _Maçonnerie\r\nMixte_, and nominally under the jurisdiction of headquarters in Paris,\r\nCo-Masonry does not appear to be pro-French in its sympathies. On the\r\ncontrary, the Co-masonic lodges in this country, as also the head lodge\r\nin the Rue Jules-Breton, seem to have adopted that form of universal\r\nbrotherhood which principally redounds to the benefit of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Stella Matutina, whilst professing to be solely concerned in occult\r\nscience and warning its members against Co-Masonry on account of the\r\npolitical tendencies of the latter, is nevertheless still more imbued\r\nwith German influence, since, as we have seen, it has ever since it\r\nfirst came into existence been secretly under Germany direction. Indeed,\r\nduring the war this influence became so apparent that certain patriotic\r\nmembers, who had entered the society in all good faith with the idea of\r\nstudying occult science, raised an energetic protest and a schism took\r\nplace. Thus, just as in the case of Co-Masonry, the more clear-sighted\r\nrecognized the imprudence of placing themselves under foreign control.\r\nThat this was no imaginary danger is shown by a correspondence which had\r\ntaken place some years earlier and has recently been brought to light.\r\nIt will be remembered that the great aim of Weishaupt and the Illuminati\r\nof the eighteenth century was to obtain control over all existing\r\nmasonic and occult Orders, This also became the dream of Rudolf Steiner\r\nand his allies in other countries, whose plan was to form what they\r\ncalled an \"International Bund.\" The idea of an International Bureau for\r\nMasonic Affairs had already, as we have seen, been started in\r\nSwitzerland; this was the same idea applied to occult groups, so that\r\nall such societies as Rosicrucianism, Theosophy with its various\r\nramifications of Co-Masonry, etc., Hermetic Orders, isolated occultists,\r\nand so on, were to be placed under German control. The audacity of the\r\nproposal seems to have been too much even for some of the most\r\ninternationally minded members of the Stella Matutina, and in the\r\ndiscussion that took place it was pointed out that admirable as the\r\nscheme might be, there was nevertheless some British spirit amongst\r\nthese Orders to be reckoned with. Even Mrs. Besant's followers, headed\r\nby the Co-Masons, described as a group which \"attracts a large number of\r\nidle women who have leisure to take a little occultism with their\r\nafternoon tea,\" might be liable to ask, \"Who are these Germans to\r\ninterfere?\" But the real obstacle to success was held to be British\r\nFreemasonry, to which a certain number of students of occult science,\r\nincluding all the members of the S.R.I.A., belonged. \"English Masonry,\"\r\nit was remarked, \"boasts the Grand Lodge of 1717, the Mother Lodge of\r\nthe World. They are a proud, jealous, autocratic body. Co-Masonry\r\nderives from the Grand Orient of France, an illegitimate body according\r\nto English ruling. No English Mason can work with Co-Masons.... If the\r\nEnglish Grand Lodge hears of anything called 'Esoteric Masonry' derived\r\nfrom such sources, under chiefs once T.S. [Theosophical Society]\r\nmembers, under a head in Berlin, it will not enquire who Dr. Steiner is\r\nor what is the nature of his work, it will simply say, 'No English\r\nMasons of the Free and Accepted Masons may join any Society working\r\npseudo-Masonic rites, i.e. no one of ordinary accepted Freemasonry can\r\nattend any meetings or attend any grades in this illegitimate body.'\r\nFinis!... If a lodge of the Continental Order is to be established in\r\nEngland, Dr. Steiner will be faced with the Masonic difficulty. This is\r\nreally serious....\"[727]\r\n\r\nHere then is one of the finest tributes ever paid to British Masonry,\r\nfor it shows that as at present constituted and controlled it provides\r\nthe most formidable barrier against the infiltration of this country by\r\nalien or subversive secret societies. Thus the Freemasons and the Roman\r\nCatholics are recognized as the principal obstacles to success. The\r\nFreemasons, however, would do well to realize the attempts that are made\r\nto break down this resistance by traitors in the Masonic camp, who,\r\nafter violating their obligations by belonging to an irregular secret\r\nsociety, act as recruiting agents in the lodges. For the author of these\r\nremarks was a British Freemason who, in collusion with a foreign adept,\r\nproposed to penetrate Freemasonry by the process known in revolutionary\r\nlanguage as \"boring from within.\" To quote his own words, \"_They must be\r\ngot at from within, not from without_.\" This was to be accomplished in\r\nvarious ways--by adepts of the Continental Order getting themselves\r\ninitiated into orthodox Masonry and then spreading their own doctrines\r\nin the lodges, or by enlisting recruits amongst orthodox Masons and\r\nusing them as propagandists among their brother-Masons. It was also\r\nsuggested that in order not to rouse suspicion it would be better to\r\navoid the name \"Esoteric Masonry,\" to adopt one of the rituals used in\r\nEngland, and to employ as \"officers\" a \"mixed group\" drawn from various\r\nsecret societies. This plan has been carried out with considerable\r\nsuccess, and at a recent conference held by a high Continental adept\r\nunder the most distinguished patronage, it was interesting to notice the\r\nvarious secret societies represented by certain of the promoters, who of\r\ncourse to the general public appeared to be merely isolated individuals\r\ninterested in philosophical speculation. But it is time to pass on to\r\nthe question of yet another secret association, for amongst those\r\npresent at the Conference referred to were members of the group Clarté.\r\n\r\nThis society, of which the name as well as its avowed aims are\r\nsingularly reminiscent of Illuminism, was first heard of in France and\r\nwas led by men who carried on active anti-patriotic propaganda\r\nthroughout the war. Amongst these was Henri Barbusse, author of _Le\r\nFeu_, a defeatest novel which was received with acclamations from\r\n\"illuminated\" reviewers in the press of this country. Yet although\r\noutwardly a French organization, the real inspiration and teaching of\r\n_Clarté_ is essentially German-Jewish and a great number of Jews are to\r\nbe found amongst its members, particularly in Central Europe. At the\r\ninaugural meeting of the Austrian group it was stated that 80 per cent.\r\nof those present were of the Jewish race. The keynote of _Clarté_ is\r\nInternationalism--abolition of nationality, destruction of frontiers,\r\nand pacifism or rather the substitution of class warfare for war\r\nbetween nations. For this purpose it is willing to make use of all\r\nsubversive doctrines, to whatever school of thought they may belong.\r\nHence, although the creed of the leaders is professedly Socialism, they\r\nreadily co-operate with Syndicalists, Anarchists, or revolutionaries of\r\nany brand, carrying on propaganda in Trade Unions and various workers'\r\norganizations; some are secretly in the ranks of the Communists. In fact\r\nmembers of _Charté_ have succeeded in penetrating into almost every\r\nsubversive group, even as far afield as New Zealand, where the society\r\nhas an agency in Wellington and disseminates the most violent\r\nrevolutionary teaching and literature.\r\n\r\nBut whilst thus making use of the \"proletariat\" to further its ends, the\r\npoint of view of _Clarté_ is fundamentally undemocratic--for the real\r\ngrievances of the workers it has no use at all. The plan of this\r\ngroup--who were recently described in the French press as \"the finest\r\nspecimens of cannibals smeared with humanitarianism (les plus beaux\r\nspécimens de cannibales barbouillés d'humanitairerie)\"--is to constitute\r\na sort of International Hierarchy of Intellectual Socialists, whose\r\ninfluence is to make itself invisibly felt in literary, educational, and\r\nartistic circles all over the world. For the members of _Clarté_ are as\r\ncareful as were the adepts of Weishaupt to preserve their incognito and\r\nnot to be known as \"Illuminati.\" Thus the public in our own country and\r\nelsewhere, reading the diatribes of certain well-known authors against\r\nthe existing order of society, may vaguely wonder why men living amidst\r\nall the amenities of civilization should desire its destruction, but do\r\nnot dream that all this is not the outcome of an individual brain but\r\npropaganda put out by a company which, having largely primed such\r\nwriters with ideas, is able, owing to the high position of many of its\r\nleading members and its influence with the literary world, to ensure the\r\nsuccess of any publication that will further its ends.\r\n\r\nThe organization of _Clarté_ thus approximates more nearly, to the\r\nsystem of Weishaupt than that of the other societies described in this\r\nchapter. Although in the strictest sense a secret society, it is in no\r\nsense occult and therefore possesses no ritual of its own, but, like the\r\nearlier Illuminati, recognizes the utility of working through\r\nFreemasonry. _Clarté_, in fact, forms an adjunct of the Grand Orient and\r\nowns a lodge under its jurisdiction in Paris. It would be interesting,\r\nhowever, to know whether the idea of the alliance with the Grand Orient\r\noccurred as an afterthought to the _Clarté_ group or whether the\r\noriginal inspiration of _Clarté_ emanated from an inner circle of the\r\nGrand Orient. We shall return to the question of this inner circle in a\r\nlater chapter.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the principal secret societies at work in Great Britain,\r\nbut amongst minor secret or semi-secret movements may be mentioned the\r\nstrange sect the Faithists, said to have some affinity with the Druses,\r\ninhabiting a singularly unromantic London suburb, whose \"Ancient\r\nFounder\" is the author of a series of tracts urging man not to be misled\r\nby false Gods, but to worship \"Jehovih the Creator only,\" and at the\r\nsame time advocating nationalization as a cure for all social ills; or\r\nagain The Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at\r\nFontainebleau, led by Gurdjieff and Uspenski which combines esoteric\r\nmeditation with an extremely meagre diet and strenuous manual labour. It\r\nis interesting, by the way, to notice that the art of movement known as\r\nEurhythmy--not to be confounded with the system of M. Dalcroze which is\r\nknown in England only as Eurhythmics--forms an important part of the\r\ncurriculum of the last society, as also of Herr Steiner's Order, of the\r\nStella Matutina, and of the Russian Bolsheviks.[728]\r\n\r\nThe one question that presents itself to the judicial mind after\r\nexamining all these movements, is inevitably: Are they of any real\r\nimportance? Can a few hundreds, or even thousands, of men and women,\r\ndrawn largely by curiosity or want of occupation into societies of which\r\nthe very names are hardly known to the general public, exercise any\r\ninfluence on the world at large? It would certainly be an error to\r\noverestimate the power that each of these societies individually can\r\nwield; to do so would be, in fact, to play into the hands of the\r\nleaders, whose plan, from Weishaupt onwards, has always been to\r\nrepresent themselves as directing the destinies of the universe. This\r\nclaim to power is the bait laid for neophytes, who are made to believe\r\nthat \"the Order will one day rule the world.\" But, whilst recognizing\r\nthe folly of this pretension, we should be mistaken in underrating their\r\nimportance, for the reason that they provide evidence of a larger\r\norganization in the background. The Stella Matutina may be only an\r\nobscure Fraternity, even the Theosophical Society with all its\r\nramifications[729] may not be of great importance in itself, but will\r\nanyone with a knowledge of European affairs seriously maintain that the\r\nGrand Orient is a small or unimportant organization? And have we not\r\nseen that investigations into the smaller secret societies frequently\r\nlead back to this greater masonic power? Secret societies are of\r\nimportance, because they are, moreover, symptomatic, and also because,\r\nalthough the work actually carried out in their lodges or councils may\r\nbe of a trivial character, they are able by the power of association and\r\nthe collective force they generate to influence public opinion and to\r\nfloat ideas in the outside world which may have far-reaching\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the fact that they exist finally disposes of the contention\r\nthat secret societies of a subversive and even of an abominable kind are\r\nthings of the past. These amazing cults, these strange perverted rites\r\nwhich we associate with the dark ages, are going on around us to-day.\r\nIlluminism, Cabalism, and even Satanism are still realities. In 1908\r\nMonsieur Copin Albancelli stated that circumstances had afforded him the\r\nproof that--\r\n\r\n     certain Masonic societies exist which are Satanic, not in the sense\r\n     that the devil comes to preside at their meetings, as that romancer\r\n     of a Leo Taxil pretended, but in that their initiates profess the\r\n     cult of Lucifer. They adore him as the true God, and they are\r\n     animated by an implacable hatred against the Christian God, whom\r\n     they declare to be an impostor. They have a formula which sums up\r\n     their state of mind; it is no longer: \"To the glory of the Great\r\n     Architect of the Universe,\" as in the two lower Masonries; it is G∴\r\n     E∴ A∴ A∴ L∴ H∴ H∴ H∴ A∴ D∴ M∴ M∴ M∴, which means \"Gloire et Amour à\r\n     Lucifer! Haine! haine! haine! an Dieu maudit! maudit! maudit!\"\r\n     (Glory and Love for Lucifer! Hatred! hatred! hatred! to God,\r\n     accursed, accursed, accursed!)\r\n\r\n     It is professed in these societies that all that the Christian God\r\n     commands is disagreeable to Lucifer; that all that He forbids is,\r\n     on the contrary, agreeable to Lucifer; that in consequence one must\r\n     do all that the Christian God forbids and that one must shun like\r\n     fire all that He commands. I repeat that with regard to all that, I\r\n     have the proofs under my hand. I have read and studied hundreds of\r\n     documents relating to one of these societies, documents that I have\r\n     not permission to publish and which emanate from the members, men\r\n     and women, of the group in question.[730]\r\n\r\nI do not say that any society in England consciously practices this cult\r\nof Satan, but I too have seen dozens of documents relating to occult\r\ngroups in this country which practise rites and evocations that lead to\r\nillness, moral perversion, mental derangement, and even in some cases to\r\ndeath. I have heard from the lips of initiates themselves accounts of\r\nthe terrible experiences through which they have passed; some have even\r\nurged me to bring the matter before the attention of the authorities.\r\nBut unfortunately no department exists for the investigation of\r\nsubversive movements. Yet since all these movements are intimately\r\nconnected with revolutionary agitation they are well worth the attention\r\nof Governments that desire to protect law, order, and public morality.\r\nThe fact is that the very extravagance of their doctrines and practices\r\nseems to ensure their immunity. Nevertheless, whether the power at work\r\nbehind them is of the kind we are accustomed to call \"supernatural,\" or\r\nwhether it is merely the outcome of the human mind, there can be no\r\ndoubt of its potency for evil and of its very definite effects in the\r\nobliteration of all sense of truth and in sexual perversion.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of an initiate who belonged for years to the Stella\r\nMatutina, the dynamic force employed known as \"Kundalini\" is simply an\r\nelectro-magnetic force, of which the sex-force is a part, on which the\r\nadepts know how to play, and \"the unseen hand behind all the seeming\r\nSpiritism of these Orders is a system of very subtle and cunning\r\nhypnotism and suggestion.\" Further, the aim of this group like that of\r\nall subversive Esoteric Orders, is, by means of such processes as\r\neurhythmics, meditations, symbols, ceremonies, and formulas, to awaken\r\nthis force and produce false \"Illumination\" for the purpose of obtaining\r\n\"Spiritual Seership,\" which is at most clairvoyance, clairaudience, etc.\r\nThe ceremonies of the Order are hypnotic, and by suggestion create the\r\nnecessary mental and astral atmosphere, hypnotize and prepare the\r\nmembers to be the willing tools in the hands of the controlling adepts.\r\nThe same initiate has communicated to me the following conclusions\r\nconcerning the group in question, with the permission to quote them\r\nverbatim:\r\n\r\n     I have been convinced that we, as an Order, have come under the\r\n     power of some very evil occult Order, profoundly versed in science\r\n     both occult and otherwise, though not infallible, their methods\r\n     being Black Magic, that is to say, electro-magnetic power,\r\n     hypnotism, and powerful suggestion.\r\n\r\n     We are convinced that the Order is being controlled by some SUN\r\n     Order after the nature of the Illuminati, if not by that Order\r\n     itself.\r\n\r\n     The reason why they (the leaders of all such Orders) insisted so\r\n     much upon the Church and Sacrament, especially before the\r\n     initiation, is, I think, for the same reason as the use of the\r\n     consecrated Host in Black Magic. The Christian consecration and the\r\n     use of the sacraments renders the building or person more powerful\r\n     as a material basis for black magic even as in white magic--\"for\r\n     the Great Good or the Great Evil.\" When the initiation is\r\n     accomplished and the domination of the person complete, there is no\r\n     further need for Church or Sacrament.\r\n\r\n     We are told at the Initiation: \"There is nothing incompatible with\r\n     your civil, moral, or religious duties in this obligation.\" We now\r\n     are convinced that this Order is contrary absolutely to our civil,\r\n     moral, and religious duties; which being so, our obligations are\r\n     null and void.\r\n\r\n     We are told that all that has taken place in Russia and elsewhere\r\n     is due to these International Occult Forces set in motion by\r\n     Subversive Esoteric Lodges. Yet it is known that we have several\r\n     branches of these same Esoteric Masonic Lodges carrying on their\r\n     deadly work in our midst. England, as well as Europe, seems to be\r\n     drifting along in a hypnotic sleep, and even our soundest\r\n     politicians seem paralysed and all that they attempt is turned to\r\n     foolishness. Is there no one in authority who understands these\r\n     things and realizes the danger both to the country and to\r\n     individuals from these forces working for disruption and world\r\n     revolution?\r\n\r\nHow in the face of these declarations, coming from those inside the\r\nmovement, can anyone maintain that Illuminism is dead and that secret\r\nsocieties present no danger to Christian civilization?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nOPEN SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the sceptical reader who has reached this stage of the present\r\nwork will perhaps be willing to admit that some connexion may be traced\r\nbetween hidden forces and open subversive movements, the objection he\r\nwill still raise against the general thesis here set forth will probably\r\nbe expressed somewhat in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"It is quite possible that secret societies and other unseen agencies\r\nmay have played a part in revolutions, but to attribute the continued\r\nrevolt against the existing social order to these causes is absurd.\r\nPoverty, unemployment, inadequate housing, and above all the\r\ninequalities of human life are quite sufficient to produce a\r\nrevolutionary spirit without the aid of secret instigators. Social\r\nrevolution is simply a rising of the 'have-nots' against the 'haves,'\r\nand requires no further cause to explain it.\"\r\n\r\nLet it be at once admitted that the injustices here enumerated are real.\r\nThe working classes throughout the nineteenth century had very genuine\r\nreasons for complaints. Wages were far too low, the rich sometimes\r\nshowed themselves indifferent to the sufferings of the poor, employers\r\nof labour often made profits out of all proportion to the remuneration\r\npaid to the workers. Nor, in spite of the immense reforms introduced\r\nduring the last hundred years, have all these grievances been redressed.\r\nThe slums of our great cities still constitute a blot upon our\r\ncivilization. Profiteering since the beginning of the war has been more\r\nflagrant than ever. \"Rings\" and combines provide fabulous wealth for\r\nindividuals or groups at the expense of vast numbers of consumers. And\r\nin all classes of the community, just as before the French Revolution,\r\npeople feast and dance whilst others live on the border-line of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nBut let us see how far the Socialist movement can be regarded as the\r\nspontaneous revolt of the \"people\" against this condition of things.\r\nDividing the people after the manner of Marx into the non-revolutionary\r\nand the \"revolutionary proletariat,\" we shall find that the former\r\ncategory, by far the larger, combines with a strong respect for\r\ntradition a perfectly reasonable desire for social reform. Briefly it\r\nasks for adequate wages, decent housing, and a fair share of the good\r\nthings of life. For State interference in the affairs of everyday life\r\nit feels nothing but abhorrence. The ideal of Communism as formulated by\r\nLenin, wherein \"the getting of food and clothing shall be no longer a\r\nprivate affair,\"[731] would meet with stronger opposition from working\r\nmen--and still more from working women, to whom \"shopping\" is as the\r\nbreath of life--than from any other section of the population. Even such\r\napparently benign Socialist schemes as \"communal dining-rooms\" or\r\n\"communal kitchens\" appeal less to the working-class mentality than to\r\nthe upper-class mind that devises them.\r\n\r\nTurning to the \"revolutionary proletariat,\" we shall find this\r\nindividualistic instinct quite as strongly developed. It is not the\r\nSocialist idea of placing all wealth and property in the hands of the\r\nState, but the Anarchist plan of \"expropriation,\" of plunder on a\r\ngigantic scale for the benefit of the revolutionary masses, which really\r\nappeals to the disgruntled portion of the proletariat. The Socialist\r\nintellectual may write of the beauties of nationalization, of the joy of\r\nworking for the common good without hope of personal gain; the\r\nrevolutinary working man sees nothing to attract him in all this.\r\nQuestion him on his ideas of social transformation, and he will\r\ngenerally express himself in favour of some method by which he will\r\nacquire something he has not got; he does not want to see the rich man's\r\nmotor-car socialized by the State--he wants to drive about in it\r\nhimself. The revolutionary working man is thus in reality not a\r\nSocialist but an Anarchist at heart. Nor in some cases is this\r\nunnatural. That the man who enjoys none of the good things of life\r\nshould wish to snatch his share must at least appear comprehensible.\r\nWhat is not comprehensible is that he should wish to renounce all hope\r\nof ever possessing anything. Modern Socialist propagandists are very\r\nwell aware of this attitude of the working classes towards their\r\nschemes, and therefore that as long as they explain the real programme\r\nthey mean to put into operation, which is nothing but the workhouse\r\nsystem on a gigantic scale, they can meet with no success. As a\r\nlife-long Socialist has frequently observed to me, \"Socialism has never\r\nbeen a working-class movement; it was always we of the middle or upper\r\nclasses who sought to instil the principles of Socialism into the minds\r\nof working men.\" Mr. Hyndman's candid confessions of the failures to\r\nenlist the sympathies even of slum-dwellers in his schemes of social\r\nregeneration bear out this testimony.\r\n\r\nLess honest Socialist orators as the result of long experience have\r\ntherefore adopted the more effectual policy of appealing to the\r\npredatory instincts of the crowd. From Babeuf onwards, Socialism has\r\nonly been able to make headway by borrowing the language of Anarchy in\r\norder to blast its way to power.\r\n\r\nSocialism is thus essentially a system of deception devised by\r\nmiddle-class theorists and in no sense a popular creed. Had the\r\nrevolutionary movement of the past 150 years really proceeded from the\r\npeople, it would inevitably have followed the line laid down by one of\r\nthe two sections of the proletariat indicated above, that is to say, it\r\nwould either have taken the form of a continuous and increasing\r\nagitation for social reforms which would have enlisted the sympathy of\r\nall right-thinking men and must therefore in the end have proved\r\nirresistible, or it would have followed the line of Anarchy, organizing\r\nbrigandage on a larger and yet larger scale, until, all owners of wealth\r\nhaving been exterminated and their expropriators in their turn\r\nexterminated by their fellows, the world would have been reduced to a\r\ndepopulated desert.\r\n\r\nBut the world revolution has followed neither of these lines. Always the\r\nopponent of sane social reforms which Socialists deride as \"melioration\"\r\nor as futile attempts to shore up an obsolete system, it has\r\nconsistently disassociated itself from such men as Lord Shaftesbury, who\r\ndid more to better the conditions of the working classes than anyone who\r\nhas ever lived. Anarchy, on the other hand, has been used by them merely\r\nas a means to an end; for genuine revolutionary sentiment they have no\r\nuse at all. In Russia the Anarchists became the first objects of Soviet\r\nvengeance. The cynical attitude of Socialists towards the revolutionary\r\nproletariat was illustrated by Mr. Bernard Shaw, who in December 1919\r\nopenly boasted that he had helped to organize the railway strike,[732]\r\nand two years later wrote about the miners' strike in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n     A Socialist State would not tolerate such an attack on the\r\n     community as a strike for a moment. If a Trade Union attempted such\r\n     a thing, the old Capitalist law against Trade Unions as\r\n     conspiracies would be re-enacted within twenty-four hours and put\r\n     ruthlessly into execution. Such a monstrosity as the recent coal\r\n     strike, during which the coal-miners spent all their savings in\r\n     damaging their neighbours and wrecking the national industries,\r\n     would be impossible under Socialism. It was miserably defeated, as\r\n     it deserved to be.[733]\r\n\r\nNow, if this had been written by the Duke of Northumberland in the\r\n_National Review_ instead of by Mr. Bernard Shaw in the _Labour\r\nMonthly_, one can imagine the outcry there would have been in the\r\nSocialist press. But the leaders of what is called democracy may always\r\nuse what language they please in speaking of the people. \"Our peasants,\"\r\nMaxim Gorky openly declared, \"are brutal and debased, hardly human. I\r\nhate them.\"[734] It will be noticed that in descriptions of the French\r\nRevolution references to the savageries of the people are never resented\r\nby the Liberal or Socialist press; the persons of the leaders alone are\r\nsacred. It is clearly not the cause of democracy but of demagogy that\r\nthese champions of \"liberty\" are out to defend.\r\n\r\nThe world-revolution is therefore not a popular movement but a\r\nconspiracy to impose on the people a system directly opposed to their\r\nreal demands and aspirations, a system which, moreover, has proved\r\ndisastrous every time an attempt has been made to put it into practice.\r\n\r\nRussia has provided a further example of its futility. The fact that the\r\nmore responsible leaders in this country do not advocate violence, does\r\nnot affect the ultimate issue. Whilst Bolshevism sets out to destroy\r\nCapitalism at a blow, Socialism prefers a more gradual process. It is\r\nthe difference between clubbing a man on the head and bleeding him to\r\ndeath--that is all.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that all Socialism leads to Communism in the long run[735]\r\nand therefore to disaster. The Bolshevist régime brought ruin and misery\r\nto Russia not because of the brutality of its methods, but because it\r\nwas founded on the gigantic economic fallacy that industry can be\r\ncarried on without private enterprise and personal initiative. The same\r\ntheory applied by constitutional methods would produce precisely the\r\nsame results. If the Socialists are ever allowed to carry out their full\r\nprogramme, England may be reduced to the state of Russia without the\r\nshedding of a drop of blood.\r\n\r\nBut how are we to explain the fact that in spite of the failure of\r\nSocialism in the past, in spite of the gigantic fiasco presented by\r\nRussia, in spite, moreover, of the declaration by the Bolsheviks\r\nthemselves that Communism had failed and must be replaced by \"a new\r\neconomic policy,\" that is to say by a return to \"Capitalism,\"[736]\r\nthere should still be a large and increasing body of people to proclaim\r\nthe efficacy of Socialism as the remedy for all social ills? In any\r\nother field of human experiment, in medicine or mechanical invention,\r\nfailure spells oblivion; the prophylactic that does not cure, the\r\nmachine that cannot be made to work, is speedily relegated to the\r\nscrap-heap. What indeed should we say of the bacteriologist, who, after\r\nkilling innumerable patients with a particular serum, were to advertise\r\nit as an unqualified success? Should we not brand such a man as an\r\nunscrupulous charlatan or at best as a dangerous visionary? If,\r\nmoreover, we were to find that large bands of agents backed by unlimited\r\nfunds, were engaged in pressing his remedy upon the public and carefully\r\navoiding all reference to the fatalities it had caused, should we not\r\nfurther conclude that there was \"something behind all this\"--some\r\npowerful company \"running\" the concern with a view to advancing its own\r\nprivate interests?\r\n\r\nWhy should not the same reasoning be applied to Socialism? For not only\r\nhas Socialism never been known to succeed, but all its past failures are\r\ncarefully kept dark by its exponents. Who, then, stands to gain by\r\nadvocating it? And further, who provides the vast sums spent on\r\npropaganda? If in reality Socialism is a rising of the \"have-nots\"\r\nagainst the \"haves,\" how is it that most of the money seems to be on\r\nthe side of the \"have-nots\"? For whilst organizations working for law\r\nand order are hampered at every turn for funds, no financial\r\nconsiderations ever seem to interfere with the activities of the\r\nso-called \"Labour movement.\" Socialism, in fact, appears to be a\r\nthoroughly \"paying concern,\" into which a young man enters as he might\r\ngo into the City, with the reasonable expectation of \"doing well.\" It is\r\nonly necessary to glance at the history of the past hundred years to\r\nrealize that \"agitation\" has provided a pleasant and remunerative career\r\nfor hundreds of middle-class authors, journalists, speakers, organizers,\r\nand dilettantes of all kinds who would otherwise have been condemned to\r\npass their lives on office-stools or at schoolmasters' desks. And when\r\nwe read the accounts of the delightful treats provided for these\r\n\"devoted workers\" in the cause of the proletariat as given in the\r\nrecords of the First Internationale or the pages of Mrs. Snowden, we\r\nbegin to understand the attractions of Socialism as a profession.[737]\r\n\r\nBut again I repeat: _Who provides the funds for this vast campaign_? Do\r\nthey come out of the pockets of the workers or from some other\r\nmysterious reservoir of wealth? We shall return to this point in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nHow is it possible at any rate to believe in the sincerity of the\r\nexponents of equality who themselves adopt a style of living so\r\ndifferent from that of the proletariat whose cause they profess to\r\nrepresent? If the doctrinaires of Socialism formed a band of ascetics\r\nwho had voluntarily renounced luxury and amusement in order to lead\r\nlives of poverty and self-sacrifice--as countless really devoted men and\r\nwomen _not_ calling themselves Socialists have done--we should still\r\ndoubt the soundness of their economic theories as applied to society in\r\ngeneral, but we should respect their disinterestedness. But with very\r\nfew exceptions Socialist Intellectuals dine and sup, feast and amuse\r\nthemselves with as few scruples of conscience as any unregenerate\r\nTories.\r\n\r\nWith people such as these it is obviously as futile to reason, as it\r\nwould be to attempt to convince the agent of a quack medicine company\r\nthat the nostrums he presses on the public will not effect a cure. He is\r\nvery well aware of that already. Hence the efforts of well-meaning\r\npeople to set forth in long, well-reasoned arguments the \"fallacies of\r\nSocialism\" produce little or no result. All these so-called \"fallacies\"\r\nhave been exposed repeatedly by able writers and disproved by all\r\nexperience, so that if based merely on ignorance or error they would\r\nlong since have ceased to obtain credence. The truth is that they are\r\nnot fallacies but lies, deliberately devised and circulated by men who\r\ndo not believe in them for a moment and who can therefore only be\r\ndescribed as unscrupulous charlatans exploiting the credulity of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nBut if this description may be legitimately applied to the brains behind\r\nSocialism and to certain of its leading doctrinaires, there are\r\ndoubtless thousands of honest visionaries to be found in the movement. A\r\nsystem that professes to cure all the ills of life inevitably appeals to\r\ngenerous minds that feel but do not reason. In reality many of these\r\npeople, did they but know it, are simply social reformers at heart and\r\nnot Socialists at all, and their ignorance of what Socialism really\r\nmeans leads them to range themselves under the banner of a party that\r\nclaims a monopoly of ideals. Others again, particularly amongst the\r\nyoung intelligentsia, take up Socialism in the same spirit as they would\r\nadopt a fashion in ties or waistcoats, for fear of being regarded as\r\n\"reactionaries.\" That in reality, far from being \"advanced,\" the\r\nprofession of Socialism is as retrogressive as would be a return to the\r\nside-whiskers and plaid trousers of the last century, does not occur to\r\nthem. The great triumph of Mussolini was to make the youth of Italy\r\nrealize that to be a Communist was to be a \"back number,\" and that\r\nprogress consisted in marching forward to new ideas and aspirations. The\r\nyoung men of Cabet's settlement discovered this sixty years ago when\r\nthey formed themselves into a band of \"Progressives\" in opposition to\r\nthe old men who still clung to the obsolete doctrine of Communism.\r\n\r\nSocialism at the present moment is in reality less a creed than a cult,\r\nfounded not on practical experience but on unreal theory. It is here we\r\nfind a connexion with secret societies. M. Augustin Cochin in his\r\nbrilliant essays on the French Revolution[738] has described that \"World\r\nof the Clouds\" of which the Grand Orient was the capital, peopled by the\r\nprecursors of the French Revolution. \"Whilst in the real world the\r\ncriterion of all thought lies in putting it to the test,\" there in the\r\nWorld of the Clouds the criterion is opinion. \"They are there to talk,\r\nnot to do; all this intellectual agitation, this immense traffic in\r\nspeeches, writings, correspondence, leads not to the slightest beginning\r\nof work, of real effort.\" We should be wrong to judge them harshly;\r\ntheir theories on the perfectibility of human nature, on the advantages\r\nof savagery, which appear to us \"dangerous chimeras,\" were never\r\nintended to apply to real life, only to the World of the Clouds, where\r\nthey present no danger but become, on the contrary, \"the most fecund\r\ntruths.\"\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary explosion might well have finally shattered these\r\nillusions but for the Grand Orient. We have already seen the identity of\r\ntheory between French Masonry and French Socialism in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. It was thus that, although in France one experiment after\r\nanother demonstrated the unreality of Socialist Utopias, the lodges were\r\nalways there to reconstruct the mirage and lead humanity on again across\r\nthe burning desert sands towards the same phantom palm-trees and\r\nillusory pools of water.\r\n\r\nWhatever the manner in which these ideas penetrated to this\r\ncountry--whether through the Radicals of the last century, adorers of\r\nthe Encyclopædist Masons of France, or through the British disciples of\r\nGerman Social Democrats from the time of the First Internationale\r\nonwards--it is impossible to ignore the resemblance between the theories\r\nnot only of French but of modern British Socialism and the doctrines of\r\nilluminized Freemasonry. Thus the idea running through Freemasonry of a\r\nGolden Age before the Fall, when man was free and happy, and which\r\nthrough the application of masonic principles is to return once more,\r\nfinds an exact counterpart in the Socialist conception of a past halcyon\r\nera of Liberty and Equality, which is to return not merely in the form\r\nof a regenerated social order, but as a complete Millennium from which\r\nall the ills of human life have been eliminated. This idea has always\r\nhaunted the imagination of Socialist writers from Rousseau to William\r\nMorris, and leads directly up to the further theory--the necessity for\r\ndestroying civilization.\r\n\r\nI cannot find in Mr. Lothrop Stoddart's conception of the revolutionary\r\nmovement as the revolt of the \"Under Man\" against civilization, the\r\norigin of this campaign. In reality the leaders of world-revolution have\r\nnot been \"Under Men,\" victims of oppression or of adverse fate, nor\r\ncould they be ranged in this category on account of physical or mental\r\ninferiority. It is true that most revolutionary agitators have been in\r\nsome way abnormal and that the revolutionary army has largely been\r\nrecruited from the unfit, but the real inspirers of the movement have\r\nfrequently been men in prosperous circumstances and of brilliant\r\nintellect who might have distinguished themselves on other lines had\r\nthey not chosen to devote their talents to subversion. To call\r\nWeishaupt, for example, an \"Under Man\" would be absurd. But let us see\r\nwhat is the idea on which the plan of destroying civilization is\r\nostensibly founded.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Rousseau like Weishaupt held that the Golden\r\nAge of felicity did not end in the garden of Eden, as is popularly\r\nsupposed, but was prolonged into tribal and nomadic life. Up to this\r\nmoment Communism was the happy disposition under which the human race\r\nexisted and which vanished with the introduction of civilization.\r\nCivilization is therefore the _fons et origo mali_ and should be done\r\naway with. Let no one exclaim that this theory died out either with\r\nRousseau or with Weishaupt; the idea that \"civilization is all wrong\"\r\nruns all through the writings and speeches of our Intellectual\r\nSocialists to-day. I have referred elsewhere to Mr. H.G. Wells's\r\nprediction that mankind will more and more revert to the nomadic life,\r\nand Mr. Snowden has recently referred in tones of evident nostalgia to\r\nthat productive era when man \"lived under a system of tribal\r\nCommunism.\"[739] The children who attend the Socialist Schools are also\r\ntaught in the \"Red Catechism\" the advantages of savagery, thus:\r\n\r\nQuestion. Do savages starve in the midst of plenty?\r\n\r\nAnswer. No; when there is plenty of food they all rejoice, feast, and\r\nmake merry.[740]\r\n\r\nThat when there is not plenty of food they occasionally eat each other\r\nis not mentioned.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the theory on which this yearning for a return to nature\r\nis based. For it is quite probable that if a Golden Age ever existed it\r\nwas Communistic; it is also true that certain primitive tribes have\r\nfound it possible to continue the same system, for the simple reason\r\nthat when and where the earth was very thinly populated it brought\r\nforth, without the artificial aid of agriculture, more than enough to\r\nsupply each man's needs. There was therefore no need for laws to protect\r\nproperty, since every man could help himself freely to all that he\r\nrequired. If at the present time a dozen people were shipwrecked on a\r\nfertile island some miles in area, the institution of property would be\r\nequally superfluous; if, however, several hundred were to share the same\r\nfate, it would at once become necessary to institute some system of\r\ncultivation which in its turn would necessitate either the institution\r\nof property, by which each man would depend on his own plot of land for\r\nhis existence, or a communal system, by which all would be obliged to\r\nwork for the common good and force applied to those who refused to do\r\ntheir allotted share.\r\n\r\nPeaceful Communism is thus simply a matter of population; the conditions\r\nunder which men can sit in the sun and enjoy the fruits of the earth\r\nwith little effort must be transformed with the multiplication of the\r\nhuman species into a system which recognizes private property, or a\r\ncommunal State which enforces compulsory labour by means of overseers\r\nwith whips. It was perhaps an appreciation of this truth that impelled\r\nthe practical exponents of Rousseau's doctrines, the Terrorists of 1793,\r\nto embark on their \"plan of depopulation\" by way of establishing\r\nCommunism on a peaceful basis.\r\n\r\nBut our Intellectual Socialists deny this necessity on the ground that\r\nunder the benign régime of Socialism all men would be good and happy and\r\nwould work joyfully for the welfare of the community. The fact that this\r\nhas not proved the case even in voluntary Communist settlements does not\r\ndaunt them, because, as has been said, their creed is founded not on\r\npractical experiment, but on theory, and it is here that we again find\r\nthe inspiration of Grand Orient Freemasonry. The assumption that under\r\nan ideal social order all human failings would vanish derives directly\r\nfrom the two masonic doctrines which the Grand Orient, under the\r\ninfluence of Illuminism, has brought to a _reductio ad absurdum_--the\r\nperfectibility of human nature and universal brotherhood. The whole\r\nphilosophy of Socialism is built upon these false premises.\r\n\r\nIndeed the actual phraseology of illuminized Freemasonry has now passed\r\ninto the language of Socialism; thus the old formulæ of \"the United\r\nStates of Europe\" and \"the Universal Republic\" have been adopted not\r\nonly by Mrs. Besant and her followers[741] as the last word in modern\r\nthought, but have also reappeared as a brilliant inspiration under the\r\npen of Mr. H.G. Wells in the slightly varied form of the \"World State.\"\r\nIt would be amusing, for anyone who had the time, to discover how many\r\nof the ideas of our so-called advanced thinkers might be found almost\r\nverbatim in the writings of Weishaupt, the _République Universelle_ of\r\nAnacharsis Clootz, and in the speeches of Grand Orient orators during\r\nthe last century.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the world-revolution is not only founded on the doctrines of\r\nilluminized Freemasonry, but has adopted the same method of\r\norganization. Thus, after the plan of the secret societies, from the\r\nBatinis onward, we shall find the forces of revolution divided into\r\nsuccessive grades--the lowest consisting of the revolutionary\r\nproletariat, the _chair a révolution_ as Marx expressed it, knowing\r\nnothing of the theory of Socialism, still less of the real aims of the\r\nleaders; above this the semi-initiates, the doctrinaires of Socialism,\r\ncomprising doubtless many sincere enthusiasts; but above these again\r\nfurther grades leading up to the real initiates, who alone know whither\r\nthe whole movement is tending.\r\n\r\nFor the final goal of world-revolution is not Socialism or even\r\nCommunism, it is not a change in the existing economic system, it is not\r\nthe destruction of civilization in a material sense; the revolution\r\ndesired by the leaders is a moral and spiritual revolution, an anarchy\r\nof ideas by which all standards set up throughout nineteen centuries\r\nshall be reversed, all honoured traditions trampled under foot, and\r\nabove all the Christian ideal finally obliterated.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a certain section of the Socialist movement proclaims\r\nitself Christian. The Illuminati made the same profession, so have the\r\nmodern Theosophists and Rosicrucians. But, as in the case of these\r\nsecret societies, we should ask of so-called Christian Socialists: What\r\ndo they means by Christ? What do they mean by Christianity? On\r\nexamination it will be found that their Christ is a being of their own\r\ninventing, that their Christianity is a perversion of Christ's real\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nThe Christ of Socialism invoked in the interests of Pacifism as the\r\nopponent of force and in the interests of class warfare as a Socialist,\r\na revolutionary, or even an \"agitator,\" bears no resemblance to the real\r\nChrist. Christ was not a Pacifist when He told His disciples to arm\r\nthemselves with swords, when He made a scourge of cords and drove the\r\nmoney-changers from the Temple. He did not tell men to forgive the\r\nenemies of their country or of their religion, but only their private\r\nenemies. Christ was not a Socialist when He declared that \"a man's life\r\nconsisteth not in the abundance of the things that he possesseth.\"\r\nSocialism teaches that a man must never rest content as long as another\r\nman possesses that which he has not. Christ did not believe in equality\r\nof payment when He told the parable of the ten talents and the\r\nunprofitable servant. Socialism would reduce all labour to the pace of\r\nthe slowest. Above all, Christ was not a Socialist when He bade the\r\nyoung man who had great possessions sell all that he had and give it to\r\nthe poor. _What School of Socialism has ever issued such a command?_ On\r\nthe contrary, Socialists are enjoined by their leaders not to give their\r\nmoney away in charity lest they should help by this means to prolong the\r\nexistence of the present social system. The truth is that, as I showed\r\nin connexion with the fallacy of representing Christ as an Essene, there\r\nis no evidence to show that He or His disciples practised even the\r\npurest form of Communism. Christ did not advocate any economic or\r\npolitical system; He preached a spirit which if applied to any system\r\nwould lead to peace among men. It is true that He enjoined His disciples\r\nto despise riches and that He denounced many of the rich men with whom\r\nHe came into contact, but it must not be forgotten that His immediate\r\nmission was to a race that had always glorified riches, that had\r\nworshipped the golden calf, and by which wealth was regarded as the\r\nnatural reward of godliness.[742] Christ came to teach men not to look\r\nfor present reward in the form of increased material welfare, but to do\r\ngood out of love to God and one's neighbour.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that in the past such men as Kingsley and J.F.D. Maurice\r\nsincerely imagined that they were following in the footsteps of the\r\nMaster by describing themselves as Christian Socialists, but that the\r\npresent leaders of Socialism in England are Christians at heart is\r\nimpossible to believe in view of their attitude towards the campaign\r\nagainst Christianity in Russia. Never once have they or their allies,\r\nthe Quakers, officially denounced the persecution not only of the\r\npriests but of all who profess the Christian faith in Russia.[743] Listen\r\nto this voice from the abyss of Russia:\r\n\r\n     We very much ask for prayer for the Church of Russia; it is passing\r\n     through great tribulation and it is a question whether spiritual or\r\n     earthly power will triumph. Many are being executed for not denying\r\n     God.... Those placed by God at the helm need all the prayer and\r\n     help of Christians all over the earth, because their fate is partly\r\n     theirs too, for it is a question of faith triumphing over atheism,\r\n     and it is a tug-of-war between those two principles.[744]\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     I look upon the persecution of the Russian Church as an effort to\r\n     overthrow Christianity in general, for we are governed just now by\r\n     the power of darkness, and all that we consider sinful seems to get\r\n     the upper hand and to prosper.[744]\r\n\r\nYet it is for this power that the Socialist Party of Great Britain have\r\nfor years been demanding recognition. Even the appeals for help from\r\ntheir fellow-Socialists in Russia have left them cold. \"We would\r\nsuggest,\" ran one such appeal--\r\n\r\n     1. That the British Labour Party issue an official protest against\r\n     the Soviet Government's inhuman treatment of its political\r\n     opponents in general and the political prisoners in particular.\r\n\r\n     2. That meetings of protest should be organized in the industrial\r\n     towns of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     3. That the British Labour Party make an official representation to\r\n     the Soviet Government directly, urging the latter to put a stop to\r\n     the persecutions of the Socialists in Russia.[745]\r\n\r\nAnd it was of this régime that Mr. Lansbury wrote:\r\n\r\n     Whatever their faults, the Communist leaders of Russia have hitched\r\n     their wagon to a star--the star of love, brotherhood,\r\n     comradeship.[746]\r\n\r\nThe callous indifference displayed by British Socialists, with the\r\nhonourable exception of the Social Democratic Federation,[747] towards\r\nthe crimes of the Bolsheviks offers indeed a painful contrast to the\r\nattitude of the other Socialists of Europe. At the conference of the\r\nLabour and Socialist International at Hamburg in May 1923, a resolution\r\nwas passed condemning the persecution by the Soviet Government. When the\r\nresolution was put to the congress, 196 voted for, 2 against it, and 39,\r\nincluding the 30 British delegates, abstained.\r\n\r\nI ask, then: Why should the Socialists of Great Britain be\r\ndifferentiated from the Bolsheviks of Russia? In every question of\r\nimportance they have always lent them their support. In the great war on\r\nChristianity they have acted as the advance guard by the institution of\r\nSocialist Sunday-schools, from which all religious teaching is excluded.\r\nSocialists are very anxious to disassociate these from the \"Proletarian\"\r\nSunday-schools which teach atheism. But from ignoring the existence of\r\nGod to denying it is but a step; moreover, it will be noticed that the\r\nSocialists have never issued any protests against the blasphemies of the\r\nProletarian schools. The real attitude of the Socialist Party towards\r\nreligion may perhaps be gauged by the notice, reproduced on page 341,\r\nwhich once appeared in its official organ the _Daily Herald_, of which\r\nMr. Lansbury, widely advertised as a fervent Christian, was once editor\r\nand is now managing director.\r\n\r\nIt was to the party controlling this organ that 700 clergymen of the\r\nChurch of England and the Episcopal Church of Scotland saw fit to offer\r\ntheir congratulations by means of a memorial presented to Mr. Ramsay\r\nMacDonald in March 1923. Shall we yet see the scene of Brumaire 1793\r\nrepeated and a procession of prelates presenting themselves at\r\nWestminster to lay down their rings and crosses and declare that\r\n\"henceforth there shall be no other worship than that of liberty and\r\nholy equality\"?\r\n\r\nAlready the desecration of the churches has begun. The red flag was\r\nrecently carried into the City Temple by a band of unemployed, although\r\nseveral of their number objected to its presence in the church. An\r\nattempt to sing \"The Red Flag\" was also suppressed by a section of the\r\nunemployed\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n<b>Books We All Pretend to have Read</b>\r\n\r\nThe Bible is a real book, although during the whole of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the Churches turned a blind eye to the fact that it was a free\r\ntranslation by Jacobean clergymen of a Greek text of doubtful\r\nauthenticity and of multiple authorship. The Bible is as divinely\r\ninspired as Shakespeare, or Milton, or Anatole France. But it is not as\r\n\"pure\" as the texts of these authors, for it is:--\r\n\r\n(1) A miscellaneous collection of folk and traditional history bound to\r\nand described as the \"Old Testament,\" and\r\n\r\n(2) \"The New Testament,\" a collection of Eastern theological doctrines\r\ncentralized in the figure of a great Syrian mystic religious teacher,\r\nJesus.\r\n\r\nThose who will go to the Bible with an unprejudiced mind will discover\r\nthat it is one of the great books of the world, full of beauty, humour,\r\nand aspiration, and disfigured, as great books often are, by occasional\r\nbrutalities and crudities. --_Daily Herald_, February 7. 1923.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nthemselves, who had apparently retained some sense ot decency.[748]\r\n\r\nWeishaupt's design of enlisting the clergy in the work of\r\nworld-revolution has been carried out according to plan. Those Catholic\r\npriests in Ireland who inflamed popular passions acted as the tools of\r\nthe International Atheist conspiracy and found at last the movement\r\nturning against themselves. The Protestant clergymen who profess\r\n\"Christian Socialism\" are playing the same part. Doubtless without\r\nknowing it, they act as the agents of the Continental Illuminati and\r\npave the way, as did the emissaries of Weishaupt, for the open attack on\r\nall forms of religion. It is not a mere accident that the blasphemous\r\nmasquerades of the French Revolution have recently been repeated in\r\nRussia. The horrible incidents described in the press[749] were simply\r\nthe outward manifestation of a continuous conspiracy of which evidence\r\nwas seen some years ago in Portugal under the influence of the\r\nCarbonarios, led by Alfonso Costa, whose utterances at times bore a\r\nstriking resemblance to those of Anacharsis Clootz. The late Duchess of\r\nBedford thus described the war on religion which inaugurated the new\r\nRepublic:\r\n\r\nOne of the most zealous enterprises of this great society [the\r\nCarbonarios] is, in their own words, to exterminate \"the Christian myth\"\r\nin the minds of the nation of Portugal. The little children in the\r\nschools have badges pinned into their clothes with the words \"No God! No\r\nreligion!\" and a British tourist who made a journey throughout the\r\ncountry of Portugal met bands of innocent babes carrying banners, on\r\nwhich the inscription was \"We have no need of God.\"[750]\r\n\r\nIs it only a coincidence that last year a Socialist and Communist\r\nmeeting in Trafalgar Square displayed a red banner bearing the motto:\r\n\"No King, no God, no Law\"?[751]\r\n\r\nI repeat: It is not an economic revolution which forms the plan of the\r\nreal directors of the movement, it is neither the \"dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat\" nor the reorganization of society by the Intelligentsia of\r\n\"Labour\"; it is the destruction of the Christian idea. Socialist orators\r\nmay inveigh against corrupt aristocracy or \"bloated Capitalists,\" but\r\nthese are not in reality the people who will suffer most if the aim of\r\nthe conspiracy is achieved. The world-revolution has always shown itself\r\nindulgent towards selfish and corrupt aristocrats, from the Marquis de\r\nSade and the Duc d'Orléans onwards; it is the gentle, the upright, the\r\nbenevolent, who have fallen victims to revolutionary fury.\r\n\r\nSocialism with its hatred of all superiority, of noble virtues--loyalty\r\nand patriotism--with its passion for dragging down instead of building\r\nup, serves the purpose of the deeper conspiracy. If the Christian\r\nIntelligentsia can be destroyed or won over and the nation deprived of\r\nall its natural leaders, the world-revolutionaries reckon that they will\r\nbe able to mould the proletariat according to their desires. This being\r\nso, the thing we now call Bolshevism forms only one phase of the\r\nmovement which is carried on by countless different methods, apparently\r\ndisconnected but all tending towards the same end. We have only to look\r\naround us in the world to-day to see everywhere the same disintegrating\r\npower at work--in art, literature, the drama, the daily press--in every\r\nsphere that can influence the mind of the public. Just as in the French\r\nRevolution a play on the massacre of St. Bartholomew was staged in order\r\nto rouse the passions of the people against the monarchy, so our modern\r\ncinemas perpetually endeavour to stir up class hatred by scenes and\r\nphrases showing \"the injustice of kings,\" \"the sufferings of the\r\npeople,\" the selfishness of \"aristocrats,\" regardles of whether these\r\nenter into the theme of the narrative or not.[752] And in the realms of\r\nliterature, not merely in works of fiction but in manuals for schools,\r\nin histories and books professing to be of serious educative value and\r\nreceiving a skilfully organized boom throughout the press, everything is\r\ndone to weaken patriotism, to shake belief in all existing institutions\r\nby the systematic perversion of both contemporary and historical facts,\r\nwhilst novels and plays calculated to undermine all ideas of morality\r\nare pressed upon the public as works of genius which, in order to\r\nmaintain a reputation for intellect, it is essential to admire. I do not\r\nbelieve that all this is accidental; I do not believe that the public\r\nasks for the anti-patriotic or demoralizing books and plays placed\r\nbefore it; on the contrary, it invariably responds to an appeal to\r\npatriotism and simple healthy emotions. The heart of the people is still\r\nsound, but ceaseless efforts are made to corrupt it.\r\n\r\nThis conspiracy has long been apparent to Continental observers. Some\r\nyears before the war, Monsieur de Lannoy, a member of an anti-masonic\r\nassociation in France, at a conference on \"the influence of\r\njudaeo-masonic sects in the theatre, in literature, in the fashions,\"\r\nshowed how \"orders of things which appear to have no connexion with\r\neach other are skilfully bound up together and directed by a single\r\nmethodical movement towards a common end. This common end is the\r\npaganization of the universe, the destruction of all Christianity, the\r\nreturn to the loosest morals of antiquity.\"[753] Robison saw in the\r\nindecent dress of the period of the Directory the result of Weishaupt's\r\nteaching, and traces to the same cause the ceremony which took place in\r\nNotre Dame when a woman of loose morals was held up to the admiration of\r\nthe public.[754] The same glorification of vice has found exponents\r\namongst the modern Illuminati in this country. In _The Equinox--the\r\nJournal of Scientific Illuminism_, it is proposed that prostitutes\r\nshould be placed on the same level as soldiers who have served their\r\ncountry and be honoured and pensioned by the State.[755] The community\r\nof women was not an idea that originated with the Russian Bolsheviks,\r\nbut one that has run through all the revolutionary movements of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to pervert all conceptions of beauty in the sphere of art\r\nserves to pave the way for moral perversion. In the _New York Herald_\r\ntwo years ago there appeared a circular protesting against the so-called\r\nModernistic cult in art as \"world-wide Bolshevist propaganda.\" The\r\ncircular went on to declare:\r\n\r\nThis aims to overthrow and destroy all existing social systems,\r\nincluding that of the arts. This modernistic degenerate cult is simply\r\nthe Bolshevist philosophy applied in art. The triumph of Bolshevism\r\ntherefore means the destruction of the present æsthetic system, the\r\ntransportation of all æsthetic values, and the deification of ugliness.\r\n\r\nThe whole propaganda of the movement was said to be organized by \"a\r\ncoterie of European art-dealers\"--elsewhere described as German--who had\r\nflooded the market with the works of artists who began as \"a small group\r\nof neurotic egomaniacs in Paris styling themselves worshippers of Satan,\r\nthe God of Ugliness.\" Some of these men were suffering from the \"visual\r\nderangement\" of the insane, whilst \"many of the pictures exhibited\r\nanother form of mania. The system of this is an incontrollable desire to\r\nmutilate the human body.\" Sadism, as we know, played a prominent part in\r\nboth the French and Russian revolutions. The most important point in\r\nall this is not that degenerates should be found to perpetrate these\r\nabominations, but what the circular describes as the \"Machiavellian\r\ncampaign organized for the unloading of these works. Editions de luxe\r\n... were published and sold by the picture dealers; ...every crafty\r\ndevice known to the picture trade was resorted to in order to discredit\r\nand destroy the heretofore universally accepted standards of\r\naesthetics.\"[756]\r\n\r\nThis process of reversing all accepted standards may also be brought\r\nabout by subtler methods. We have already seen that occult practices may\r\nlead to the obliteration of all sense of truth and of normal sexual\r\ninstincts. Under the influence of so-called occult science, which is, in\r\nreality, simply powerful suggestion or self-hypnotism, all a man's\r\nnatural impulses and inhibitive springs of action may be broken; he will\r\nno longer react to the conceptions of beauty or ugliness, or right or\r\nwrong, which, unknown to himself, formed the law of his being. Thus not\r\nonly his conscious deeds but his subconscious mental processes may pass\r\nunder the control of another, or become entirely deranged.\r\n\r\nMuch the same consequences may result from the Freud system of\r\nPsycho-Analysis, which, particularly by its insistence on sex, tends to\r\nsubordinate the will to impulses of a harmful kind. An eminent American\r\nneuro-psychiatrist of New York has expressed his opinion on this subject\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\nThe Freud theory is anti-Christian and subversive of organized society.\r\nChristianity teaches that the individual can resist temptation and\r\nFreudism teaches that the matter of yielding to or resisting temptation\r\nis one for which the individual is not wilfully responsible. Freudism\r\nmakes of the individual a machine, absolutely controlled by subconscious\r\nreflexes.... It would of course be difficult to prove that\r\npsycho-analysis has been evolved as a destructive propaganda measure,\r\nbut in one sense the point is immaterial. Whether conscious or\r\nunconscious, it makes for destructive effect.[757]\r\n\r\nIn general, the art of the conspiracy is not so much to create movements\r\nas to capture existing movements, often innocuous and even admirable in\r\nthemselves, and turn them to a subversive purpose. Thus birth control,\r\nwhich--if combined with the restriction of alien immigration and carried\r\nout under proper direction--would provide a solution to the frightful\r\nproblem of over-population, can without these provisos become a source\r\nof national weakness and demoralization. It is easy to see how a\r\nlimitation of the native population would serve the cause of England's\r\nenemies by reducing her fighting forces and by making room for\r\nundesirable aliens. That the birth-control campaign may also be used for\r\nevil purposes is suggested by the fact that it has not been confined to\r\nour own overcrowded island, but has been carried on in France, where\r\nunder-population has long constituted a tragedy. In 1903 and 1904 the\r\n\"Ligue de la Régéneration Humaine,\" founded by Monsieur Paul Robin, in\r\nits organ _L'Émancipateur_ issued not only instructions on \"the means\r\nhow to avoid large families,\" but also pamphlets on \"free love and free\r\nmaternity.\"[758] The campaign of race-suicide was thus combined with\r\nthe undermining of morality; legal families were to be limited and\r\nillegal births encouraged. This was quite in accord with the doctrines\r\nof the Grand Orient, in whose Temples, Monsieur Copin Albancelli points\r\nout, the principle of \"la libre maternité\"--known in this country as\r\n\"the right to motherhood\"--was advocated.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to notice that the apparently innocent invention of\r\nEsperanto receives support from the same quarter. This is not surprising\r\nsince we know that the idea of a universal language has long haunted the\r\nminds of Freemasons. I have myself seen a document emanating from a body\r\nof French Masons stating that Esperanto is directly under the control of\r\nthe three masonic powers of France--the Grand Orient, the Grande Loge\r\nNationale, and the Droit Humain.\r\n\r\nThat it is largely used for promoting Bolshevism has been frequently\r\nstated. In July 1922, M. Bérard, Minister of Education, issued a\r\ncircular \"to the heads of all French Universities, academies, and\r\ncolleges, calling on them not to help in any way in the teaching of\r\nEsperanto on the ground that Bolsheviks use it as one of their dangerous\r\nforms of propaganda.\"[759] A correspondent points out to me that\r\nanother universal language, Ido, is used for propaganda by the\r\nAnarchists, and that several journals distributed by revolutionary\r\nsocieties, written in Ido, are \"frankly and baldly Anarchical.\" The\r\nwriter adds:\r\n\r\nLast week I received a copy of _Libereso_ (Liberty), monthly organ of\r\nthe Anarchist Section of the \"Emancipating Star\"--\"Cosmopolitan Union of\r\nLabour-class Idists.\" It commands carrying out Anarchistic principles\r\nto their extreme limits; commends \"La Ruzo\" (ruse); is sarcastic\r\nregarding Socialism and Democracy.... It contains an appeal for help (in\r\nmoney) for the Anarchists imprisoned in Russia ... written by Alexander\r\nBerkmann and signed by him with Emma Goldmann and A. Schapiro.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a revolutionary movement which is anti-Socialist and\r\neven anti-Bolshevist, which tends to prove the opinion I have already\r\nexpressed, that Bolshevism is only one phase of the world-conspiracy.\r\nBut if we explain this by the old antagonism between the opposing\r\nrevolutionary camps of Anarchy and Socialism, how are we to account for\r\nthe fact that the same destructive purpose animates people who are\r\nneither Anarchist nor Socialist, but can only be ranged in the category\r\nof extreme reaction? Of this phase of the movement Nietzsche provides\r\nthe supreme example. In his imprecations against \"the Crucified,\" the\r\nadvocate of autocracy and militarism rivals the most infuriated of\r\nrevolutionary Socialists. The whole spirit of perversion is contained in\r\nthe description of Nietzsche by his friend Georges Brandes: \"His\r\nthoughts stole inquisitively along forbidden paths: 'This thing passes\r\nfor a value. Can we not turn it upside-down? This is regarded as good.\r\nIs it not rather evil?'\" What is this but Satanism? The case of\r\nNietzsche is not to be explained away by the fact that he died raving\r\nmad, since a number of apparently sane people still profess for him\r\nunbounded admiration, and whilst deriding Socialism and even attacking\r\nBolshevism join in the war against Christian civilization. The\r\nconspiracy therefore exists apart from so-called democratic circles.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I picked up an Italian novel by an anti-Socialist\r\ncontaining precisely the same diatribes against \"Christian-bourgeois\r\nsociety\" that are to be found in Anarchist and Bolshevist literature.\r\n\"The family,\" says the author, \"is the kernel of contemporary society\r\nand its base. Whoever would really reform or subvert must begin by\r\nreforming and subverting the family.... The family ... is the principal\r\npath of all unhappiness, of all vice, of all hypocrisy, of all moral\r\nugliness, ...\" and he goes on to show that the two countries which have\r\nproved themselves the sanest and the strongest are Germany and America,\r\nbecause they have advanced by long strides towards free love.[760]\r\n\r\nThe writer of these words may be of no importance, but they should be\r\nnoted because they are symptomatic and help us to locate certain centres\r\nof infection.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to observe all these miscellaneous movements going on\r\nall around us without being struck by the similarity of aim between\r\nthem; each seems to form part of a common plan, which, like the separate\r\npieces of a jig-saw puzzle, convey no meaning, but when fitted together\r\nmake up a perfectly clear design. That there is somewhere in the\r\nbackground a point of contact is suggested by the fact that we find\r\nmembers of the different groups playing a double and a treble rôle, the\r\nsame name occurring in the list of patrons in a Birth Control paper and\r\nin a revolutionary secret society, amongst the exponents of\r\nPsycho-Analysis and the members of an Irish Republican Committee.\r\n\r\nWith the open as with the secret forces the great method of warfare is\r\nthe capture of public opinion. A hidden influence behind the press\r\ncontributes powerfully to this end. Some of the subtlest disintegrating\r\npropaganda during the last seven years has emanated from the so-called\r\n\"Capitalist press.\" The _Daily Herald_ is only the brass band of the\r\nRevolution. It is to the journals inspired and patronized by the\r\nIntelligentsia that we must turn to find the doctrines of Illuminism set\r\nforth with the most persuasive eloquence.[761]\r\n\r\nMore than eighty years ago a Frenchman endowed with extraordinary\r\nprophetic instinct foretold not only the danger that would one day come\r\nfrom Russia, but that the press would facilitate the destruction of\r\ncivilization:\r\n\r\n     When our cosmopolitan democracy, bearing its last fruits, shall\r\n     have made of war a thing odious to whole populations, when the\r\n     nations calling themselves the most civilized on earth shall have\r\n     finished enervating themselves in their political debaucheries, ...\r\n     the floodgates of the North will open on us once again, then we\r\n     shall undergo a last invasion not of ignorant barbarians but of\r\n     cunning and enlightened masters, more enlightened than ourselves,\r\n     for they will have learnt from our own excesses how we can and must\r\n     be governed.\r\n\r\n     It is not for nothing that Providence piles up so many inactive\r\n     forces in the East of Europe. One day the sleeping giant will arise\r\n     and force will put an end to the reign of words. In vain, then,\r\n     distracted equality will call the old aristocracy to the help of\r\n     liberty; the weapon grasped again too late and wielded by hands too\r\n     long inactive will have become powerless. Society will perish for\r\n     having trusted to words void of sense or contradictory; then the\r\n     deceitful echoes of public opinion, the newspapers, wishing at all\r\n     costs to keep their readers, will push [the world] to ruin if only\r\n     to have something to relate for a month longer. They will kill\r\n     society to live upon its corpse.[762]\r\n\r\nTo-day the newspapers, no longer the echoes of public opinion but its\r\nsupreme directors, throw open their columns to every form of\r\ndisintegrating doctrine and close them to arguments that could\r\neffectually arrest the forces of destruction.\r\n\r\nWhat is the hidden influence behind the press, behind all the subversive\r\nmovements going on around us? Are there several Powers at work? Or is\r\nthere one Power, one invisible group directing all the rest--the circle\r\nof the _real Initiates_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nPAN-GERMANISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the course of this book that the idea of a secret power\r\nworking for world-revolution through both open movements and secret\r\nsocieties, is not a new one, but dates from the eighteenth century. In\r\norder to appreciate the continuity of this idea, let us recapitulate the\r\ntestimonies of contemporaries, some of which have been already quoted in\r\ntheir context, but which when collected together and placed in\r\nchronological order make up a very remarkable chain of evidence.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 the Marquis de Luchet warned France of the danger of the\r\nIlluminati, whose object was world-domination.[763] In consequence of\r\nthis \"gigantic project\" de Luchet foresees \"a series of calamities of\r\nwhich the end is lost in the darkness of time, like unto those\r\nsubterranean fires of which the insatiable activity devours the bowels\r\nof the earth and which escape into the air by violent and devastating\r\nexplosions.\"[764]\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the Duke of Brunswick in his manifesto to the German lodges\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     A great sect arose, which, taking for its motto \"the good and\r\n     happiness of man,\" worked in the darkness of the conspiracy to make\r\n     the happiness of humanity a prey for itself. This sect is known to\r\n     everyone: its brothers are known no less than its name.... The plan\r\n     they had formed for breaking all social ties and of destroying all\r\n     order was revealed in their speeches and acts.... Indomitable\r\n     pride, thirst of power, such were the only motives of this sect:\r\n     their masters had nothing less in view than the thrones of the\r\n     earth, and the government of the nations was to be directed by\r\n     their nocturnal clubs.[765]\r\n\r\nIn 1797 Montjoie, writing of the Orléaniste conspiracy, to which in an\r\nearlier work he had attributed the whole organization of the French\r\nRevolution in its first stages, observed:\r\n\r\n     I will not examine whether this wicked prince, thinking he was\r\n     acting in his personal interests, was not moved by that _invisible\r\n     hand_[766] which seems to have created all the events of our\r\n     revolution in order to lead us towards a goal that we do not see at\r\n     present, but which I think we shall see before long.[767]\r\n\r\nIn 1801 Monsignor de Savine \"made allusions in prudent and almost\r\nterrified terms to some international sect ...a power superior to all\r\nothers ...which has arms and eyes everywhere and which governs Europe\r\nto-day.\"[768]\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the Chevalier de Malet declared that \"the authors of the\r\nRevolution are not more French than German, Italian, English, etc. They\r\nform a particular nation which took birth and has increased in the dark\r\namidst all civilized nations with the object of subjecting them all to\r\nits domination.\"[769]\r\n\r\nIn 1835 the Carbonaro, Malegari, wrote to another member of the\r\nCarbonari:\r\n\r\n     We form an association of brothers in all points of the globe, we\r\n     have desires and interests in common, we aim at the emancipation of\r\n     humanity, we wish to break every kind of yoke, yet there is one\r\n     that is unseen, that can hardly be felt, yet that weighs on us.\r\n     Whence comes it? Where is it? No one knows, or at least no one\r\n     tells. The association is secret, even for us, the veterans of\r\n     secret societies.[770]\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Disraeli wrote:\r\n\r\n     It was neither parliaments nor populations, nor the course of\r\n     nature, nor the course of events, that overthrew the throne of\r\n     Louis Philippe ...the throne was surprised by the Secret Societies,\r\n     ever prepared to ravage Europe.... Acting in unison with a great\r\n     popular movement they may destroy society, as they did at the end\r\n     of the last century.[771]\r\n\r\nIn 1874 Père Deschamps, after his exhaustive study of secret societies,\r\nthus propounded the question:\r\n\r\n     We have now to ask ourselves whether there is anything but an\r\n     identity of doctrines and personal communications between the\r\n     members of the different sects, whether there is really a unity of\r\n     direction which binds together all the secret societies, including\r\n     Free Masonry. Here we touch on the most mysterious point of the\r\n     action of secret societies, on that which these national Grand\r\n     Orients who declare themselves independent of each other and\r\n     sometimes even excommunicate each other conceal most carefully\r\n     beneath a veil.[772]\r\n\r\nFinally Deschamps is led to the conclusion that there is \"a secret\r\ncouncil which directs all masonic societies,\"[773] that there are\r\nsecret lairs where the chiefs of the sects agree together on their work\r\nof destruction.[774]\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply quotations of this kind taken from many\r\ndifferent sources. Whether the men who expressed these opinions were, as\r\nwe are frequently told, suffering from delusions or not, the fact\r\nremains that the idea of a hidden hand behind world-revolution has\r\nexisted for at least 135 years. And when we compare these utterances\r\nwith Monsieur Copin Albancelli's description of an inner circle secretly\r\ndirecting the activities of the Grand Orient, and with the conclusions\r\nreached by members of other secret societies, that such a circle exists\r\nbehind all occult and masonic societies of a subversive kind, we are\r\nnecessarily led to enquire: is there one circle or rather one Power\r\nbehind both open and secret organizations working for the overthrow of\r\nthe existing social order and Christian civilization? If so, what is\r\nthis power?\r\n\r\nNow, to leave speculation for the moment and come to known facts,\r\neveryone who has seriously studied these matters is aware that there are\r\nat the present moment five principal organized movements at work in the\r\nworld with which ordered government has to contend, that may be\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Grand Orient Freemasonry.\r\n    2. Theosophy with its innumerable ramifications.\r\n    3. Nationalism of an aggressive kind, now represented by Pan-Germanism.\r\n    4. International Finance.\r\n    5. Social Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, with the exception of the fourth, these movements\r\nare those of which I have endeavoured to trace the course throughout the\r\nearlier part of this book. It is a highly significant fact that it was\r\nonly when I had reached this stage of my work I discovered there were\r\nindependent investigators who had arrived at precisely the same\r\nconclusions as myself.\r\n\r\nThe problem that now confronts us is therefore this: if there is indeed\r\none power directing all subversive movements, is it one of the five\r\nmovements here enumerated or is it yet another power more potent and\r\nmore invisible? In order to discover this, it is necessary to consider\r\nwhether these movements, although apparently divergent in their ultimate\r\npurpose, have nevertheless any ideas or any aims in common. One\r\nfundamental point of similarity will certainly be found between them.\r\nAll desire to dominate the world and to direct it along lines and\r\naccording to rules of their own devising; more than this, each desires\r\nto direct it solely for the benefit of one class of people--social,\r\nintellectual, or national as the case may be--to the entire exclusion of\r\nevery human being outside that class. Thus in reality each aspires to\r\nthe dictatorship of the world.\r\n\r\nBesides this, it will be noticed that not only these principal\r\nmovements, but also the minor subversive movements described in the last\r\nchapter, have in the main (1) a pro-German tendency--none, at any rate,\r\nare pro-French nor do they encourage British patriotism, (2) all contain\r\na Jewish element--none, at least, are \"anti-Semite,\" and (3) all have a\r\nmore or less decided antagonism to Christianity. If then, there is a\r\nsingle power behind them, is it the Pan-Germanic Power? Is it the Jewish\r\nPower? Or is it the Anti-Christian Power? Let us examine each of these\r\npossibilities in turn.\r\n\r\nViewed under the aspect of exaggerated Nationalism, the spirit of\r\nPan-Germanism is nothing new. The dream of world-domination has haunted\r\nthe imagination of many races from the time of Alexander the Great to\r\nNapoleon I, but nowhere has the plan been carried out by the\r\nMachiavellian methods which have characterized Prussian foreign policy\r\nand diplomacy from the days of Frederick the Great onwards. It is not\r\nPrussian militarism that constitutes the crime of modern Germany.\r\nMilitarism in the sense of courage, patriotism, discipline, and devotion\r\nto duty is a splendid thing. But the spirit of Pan-Germanism differs\r\nfrom the British conception of patriotism in that it overrides the\r\nrights of all other peoples and seeks to establish its domination over\r\nthe whole world. Under German domination every German would be free and\r\nevery other human being a slave. England, whilst seeking conquests, has,\r\non the other hand, always allowed the inhabitants of conquered\r\nterritories to develop along their own lines and has made use of\r\nlegislation largely to protect them from each other. The preference of\r\nthe native of India for an English judge to one of his own race is\r\nevidence of this fact. But it is further the abandonment of all\r\nprinciple, the acceptance of the doctrine that everything is\r\nallowable--lying, treachery, calumny, and bad faith--in order to achieve\r\nits end, that has placed Germany outside the comity of nations. Robison\r\ndescribes the system of the Illuminati as leading to the conclusion that\r\n\"nothing would be scrupled at, if it could be made appear that the Order\r\nwould derive advantage from it, because the great object of the Order\r\nwas held as superior to every consideration.\"[775] Change the word\r\nOrder to State, and one has the whole principle of modern German\r\nImperialism.\r\n\r\nNow, it is interesting to notice that the founders of German Illuminism\r\nand of German Imperialism drew certain of their ideas from the same\r\nsource. Both Weishaupt and Frederick the Great were earnest students of\r\nMachiavelli--and both out-did their master. This form of Machiavellism,\r\ncarried to a point probably never dreamt of by the Italian philosopher,\r\nhas run through the whole struggle of Prussia for supremacy and at the\r\nsame time through each outbreak of world revolution in which Prussian\r\ninfluence has played a part. Thus the Ems telegram in 1870, the false\r\nreport that tricked Russia into mobilization in 1914,[776] the violation\r\nof treaties and of all the laws of civilised warfare during the recent\r\nwar, were the direct outcome of doctrines that may be found in embryo in\r\n_The Prince_. So also the most striking characteristic of the French\r\nRevolution under the inspiration of Weishaupt's emissaries and the\r\nagents of Prussia, and of the present revolutionary movement inaugurated\r\nby Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, is not so much its violence as its\r\nMachiavellian cunning. The art popularly known to-day as\r\n_camouflage_--of dressing-up one design under the guise of something\r\nquite different, of making black appear white by glorifying the most\r\nignoble actions, of making white appear black by holding up all\r\nhonourable traditions to contempt and ridicule, in a word\r\n_perversion_--has been reduced to a system by the secret directors of\r\nworld revolution. It is here that we can detect the non-proletarian\r\ncharacter of the movement. The working-man of all countries is the least\r\nMachiavellian of beings; his weakness lies in the fact that he is too\r\ninarticulate, that he does not know how to put his case even when he has\r\na good one, still less to make a bad one appear plausible. It was not\r\nuntil world revolution was taken over by the faction described by\r\nBakunin as \"the German-Jew Company\" that it reassumed its Machiavellian\r\ncharacter and gradually became the formidable organization it is to-day.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from _The Prince_ will show how closely both the\r\nPrussians and the Terrorists of France and Russia have followed\r\nMachiavelli's manual for despots:\r\n\r\n\"He who usurps the government of any State is to execute and put in\r\npractice all the cruelties which he thinks material at once, that he may\r\nhave no occasion to renew them often,\" etc.[777] (Vide the German\r\nprinciple of \"frightfulness\" to be exercised against the inhabitants of\r\ninvaded territory and the plan of the French and Russian Terrorists in\r\nsuppressing \"counter-revolutionaries.\")\r\n\r\n\"It is of such importance to a prince to take upon him the nature and\r\ndisposition of a beast; of all the whole flock he ought to imitate the\r\nlion and the fox.\"[778](Vide Frederick the Great and the demagogues of\r\nFrance and Russia.)\r\n\r\n\"A prince ... who is wise and prudent, cannot or ought not to keep his\r\nparole, when the keeping of it is to his prejudice, and the causes for\r\nwhich he promised removed.\"[779] (Vide Germany's doctrine of the scrap\r\nof paper and the promises of the Bolshevist Trade Delegation in London\r\nto refrain from propaganda.)\r\n\r\n\"Because the whole multitude which submits to your government is not\r\ncapable of being armed, if you be beneficial and obliging to those you\r\ndo arm, you may make the bolder with the rest, for the difference of\r\nyour behaviour to the soldier binds him more firmly to your service,\"\r\netc.[780](Vide the insolent behaviour permitted to officers of the\r\nGerman Imperial Army and the feeding of the Red Army in Russia at the\r\nexpense of the rest of the population.)\r\n\r\n\"The prince ... is obliged ... at convenient times in the year to\r\nentertain the people by feastings and plays and spectacles of recreation\r\n... and give them some instance of his humanity and magnificence.\"[781]\r\n(Vide the important part played by \"spectacles\" in the French Revolution\r\nand by the theatre and opera in Soviet Russia. Always the same plan of\r\n\"_panem ei circenses_!\")\r\n\r\nJust after the fall of Napoleon I a French writer published a book\r\ndescribing the \"methodic perversity\" of the revolutionary leaders and\r\nthe Revolution as the beginning of a Machiavellian régime.[782] How did\r\nthis system come to be established in France unless under the guidance\r\nof Weishaupt's emissaries and the agents of Frederick the Great and of\r\nthe Illuminatus Frederick William II?\r\n\r\nGermany was well able, however, to defend herself against the\r\ndevastating doctrines of Illuminism. Always the home of secret\r\nsocieties, she became by the end of the nineteenth century the spiritual\r\nhome of Socialism. Yet although this might appear to present a danger to\r\nGerman Imperialism, no country has remained so free as Germany from\r\nserious agitation. It has been well said that the Germans are\r\ntheoretically more Socialistic than other nations, but they are far less\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the rulers of Germany have always known that they\r\ncould count not merely on the servility of the people but on their\r\nardent national spirit. A strong vein of patriotism ran through all the\r\nsecret societies even of the most subversive variety, and it was the\r\nGerman Student Orders, whence the Illuminati drew their disciples, that\r\nbecame also the recruiting-ground for the German Imperialist idea.\r\nInstead of combating subversive forces, German Imperialism adopted the\r\nfar more skilful expedient of enlisting them in its service.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that in Germany Freemasonry became a powerful aid to\r\nPrussian aggrandizement. From 1840 onwards the word of command to all\r\nthe lodges went out from Berlin,[783] and in the revolution of 1848 the\r\nFreemasons of Germany showed themselves the most ardent supporters of\r\nGerman unity under the ægis of Prussia. Later, Bismarck with superb\r\ningenuity enlisted not only Freemasons and members of secret societies\r\nbut Socialists and democrats in the same cause. Lassalle and Marx\r\ncontributed powerfully to the cause of pan-Germanism. Dammer, who\r\nsucceeded Lassalle as head of the Socialist party, instructed his\r\nsuccessor Fritsche that \"in the meetings which took place in Saxony,\r\nwhilst putting forward Socialist claims, they must not fail to demand\r\nthe unity of Germany under the domination of Prussia. Fritsche was\r\npersonally to render an account to Bismarck of the results obtained at\r\nthese meetings.\"[784]\r\n\r\nEven as far afield as Italy, Bismarck succeeded in imposing the policy\r\nof German autocracy on men who were ostensibly marching in the vanguard\r\nof \"liberty.\" \"I believe in the unity of Germany,\" Mazzini wrote to\r\nBismarck in 1867, \"and I desire it as I desire that of my own country. I\r\nabhor the empire and supremacy that France arrogates to herself over\r\nEurope.\"[785]\r\n\r\nBefore 1870 Freemasonry everywhere on the Continent helped the cause of\r\nGermany. \"The Occult Power preached pacifism and humanitarianism in\r\nFrance by means of French Freemasonry whilst it preached patriotism in\r\nGermany by means of German Freemasonry.\"[786] So although throughout\r\nthe nineteenth century the rulers of Germany permitted the dissemination\r\nof ideas antagonistic to religion, until by the dawn of the following\r\ncentury the very idea of God was rooted out of the minds of many German\r\nchildren, the Imperial Government was careful that nothing should be\r\nallowed to weaken patriotism. Indeed, the Pan-German obsession into\r\nwhich German patriotism became transformed under the influence of such\r\nmen as Treitschke and Bernhardi was, no less than revolutionary\r\nSocialism, fortified by irreligion because founded on the law of force\r\nand the absence of all moral scruple. It is thus not \"militarism\" in the\r\naccepted sense that has rendered Germany a menace to the world, but the\r\nMachiavellian plan of using for export doctrines sternly repressed\r\nwithin her own borders.\r\n\r\nI shall not enlarge here on the crime of the German Imperial Staff in\r\nsending Lenin and his fellow Bolsheviks to Russia, because I have\r\nalready dealt at length with this question in a controversy that\r\nappeared in the _Morning Post_ two years ago.[787] But whilst\r\nacknowledging the fair and courteous line of argument adopted by my\r\nGerman opponent, with which on certain points I found myself completely\r\nin agreement. I was obliged to recognize that the bar to any real\r\nunderstanding between us lay in the impossibility of persuading him to\r\nrecognize the principle that all means are not justifiable in order to\r\nobtain one's ends. This is how he expresses himself on the subject:\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Webster ... reproaches Germany for having employed seditious\r\npropaganda in the countries of the Allies, it may simply be brought to\r\nmind that all is fair in love and war. In a war, in a fight concerning\r\nlife and death, one does not look at the weapons which one takes, nor at\r\nthe values which are destroyed by using the arms. The only adviser [sic]\r\nis, first of all, the success of the fight, the salvation of one's\r\nindependence.[788]\r\n\r\nUntil Germany abandons this Machiavellian doctrine it will be impossible\r\nto treat her as a civilized Power.\r\n\r\nBut Herr Kerlen accuses England of pursuing the same Machiavellian\r\npolicy of encouraging sedition abroad. Undoubtedly England did propagate\r\nPacifism in Germany and other enemy countries and hoped to bring about a\r\npolitical revolution, that is to say, a rising of the German people\r\nagainst the rulers who had led them into war. (It should be remembered\r\nthat all the friends of Germany in this country always declared that the\r\nGerman people did not want the war and were dragged into it unwillingly\r\nby the military caste.) But is there any evidence to show that England\r\never attempted to engineer a social revolution, to undermine morality\r\nand all belief in ordered government, in a word to promote Bolshevism in\r\nGermany or elsewhere? Herr Kerlen cites the sympathy accorded in this\r\ncountry to the Kerensky revolution. But England, largely through the\r\ninfluence of the Liberals, had always entertained an exaggerated idea of\r\n\"Tzarist tyranny,\" and honestly sympathized with all efforts, however\r\nmisguided, to \"liberate\" the Russian people. Further, throughout the war\r\nthe Tzar and Tzarina had been ceaselessly represented as faithless to\r\nthe Allies--a story that we now know to have been an infamous calumny\r\ncirculated doubtless by enemy agents. This idea even obtained credence\r\nin Conservative circles, misled by false information on the situation in\r\nRussia. One must have lived through the spring of 1917 in London to\r\nrealize how completely not only the public but the authorities were\r\ndeluded. What else could be expected when the opinion of Socialists was\r\naccepted on the matter? I know from personal experience that two of the\r\nmost important Government departments were completely mistaken even on\r\nthe subject of Bolshevism, with the result that measures were not taken\r\nwhich might have checked its spread into this country.\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, the essential difference between the attitude of\r\nGermany and England to Russia was that whilst England imagined that the\r\nKerensky revolution would be for the good of Russia as well as for the\r\nadvantage of the Allies, Germany deliberately introduced into Russia\r\nwhat she knew to be a poison.\r\n\r\nAlways faithful to the maxim of _divide et impera_, Germany, after\r\nbringing Russia to ruin, has at last succeeded in causing dissensions\r\nbetween the Allies. This policy she pursued unremittingly throughout the\r\nwar. Thus whilst on one hand she was assuring the French that \"the\r\nEnglish would fight to the last breath of the last Frenchman,\" General\r\nLudendorff was instructing the Imperial Chancellor that: \"We must again\r\nand again rub in the sentence in Kuhlmann's speech to the effect that\r\nthe question of Alsace-Lorraine is the only one which stands in the way\r\nof peace. And we must lay special emphasis on the fact that the English\r\npeople are shedding their blood for an Imperialistic war-aim.\"[789]\r\n\r\nSo skilfully was this propaganda carried on after the war had ended that\r\nwhilst English officers returning to England from the occupied areas\r\nwere declaring that the friendliness of the Germans convinced them that\r\nGermany was really our friend and that we should have an \"entente\" with\r\nher rather than with France, French officers returning to France said\r\nthat the Germans had assured them that they were their best friends,\r\nthat England was the real enemy, and that it would be better to break\r\nthe Entente and form an alliance with Germany. At the same time no less\r\nthan three lines of propaganda concerning the causes of the war were\r\ngoing out from Germany, one laying all the blame on the English, one on\r\nthe French, and one on the Jews, and pamphlets embodying these\r\nconflicting theories were despatched broadcast to likely subjects in the\r\ncountries of the Allies.[790]\r\n\r\nThe greatest triumph for Imperial Germany lay in her success in\r\nenlisting the very elements amongst the Allies which might most be\r\nexpected to oppose her. Although there was no country in the world where\r\nmonarchy was so adored, militarism so universally admired, where rank\r\nand birth played so important a part, and the working classes, though\r\ncared for, so rigidly kept in subjection, Germany from the time of\r\nBismarck onwards has always been the \"spiritual home\" of British\r\nSocialists, democrats, and pacifists, just as in France she has always\r\nfound her principal allies in the masonic lodges. And this although the\r\nGerman Socialists and Freemasons have never attempted to use their\r\ninfluence in favour of the masonic and Socialist ideal of universal\r\nbrotherhood and world-peace, but, on the contrary, at every crisis have\r\nthrown in their lot with the military party. Thus before the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, whilst French Freemasons of the Loge Concordia and\r\nthe Socialists of the First Internationale were urging their brothers to\r\nrely on German Socialism to avert a conflict, the Prussian lodges were\r\nshouting Hoch! to the national colours and chanting the praises of King\r\nWilliam and \"the Prussian sword,\" and the German Social Democrats were\r\napplauding the cause of German unity.[791]\r\n\r\nExactly the same thing happened before the recent war, when Jaurès\r\nassured his fellow-Socialists that at the first sign of conflict he had\r\nonly to communicate with Berlin in order to enlist German Socialism in\r\nthe interests of peace; yet on the declaration of war the German\r\nSocialists voted solidly for war credits, whilst the British Socialists\r\nopposed participation in the war and even in some instances expressed\r\nsympathy with Germany. And let it never be forgotten, it was not\r\nSocialist Germany but Imperial Germany that won the allegiance of our\r\nso-called democrats.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this betrayal by the Socialists of Germany, in spite of the\r\nfact that they have contributed nothing to the cause of International\r\nSocialism or of world-peace, the British \"Labour\" Party never until its\r\naccession to office wavered in its policy of publicly advocating the\r\ncause of Germany. With the exception of the Social Democratic\r\nFederation, every Socialist body in this country has proclaimed\r\npro-German sentiments, and _Justice_ alone, of all Socialist organs, has\r\nexpressed its sympathy for the sufferings of France. In fact, any\r\nSocialist who dared to champion the cause of France immediately lost his\r\ninfluence and position in Socialist circles. As to the _Daily Herald_,\r\nhad it been edited in Berlin it could not more faithfully have supported\r\nGerman interests. When Alsace Lorraine was restored to France, it\r\npublished an article showing how deeply the inhabitants of this province\r\nresented being transferred from the German Empire to the French\r\nRepublic[792]; when a general strike threatened this country, it seized\r\nthe opportunity to come out with an appeal in enormous capitals to\r\nrevise the Versailles Treaty; in the matter of reparations its efforts\r\nto let Germany off altogether have been, as it itself observed,\r\n\"unceasing.\" \"The plain fact is,\" it declared on December 17, 1921,\r\n\"that these fantastic reparation demands cannot be met; and that every\r\npayment by which Germany attempts to meet them will only work further\r\nhavoc to our own commerce and our own industry. We have urged that\r\nceaselessly for three years. To-day even the Premier begins to see that\r\nwe were right, that the interests of this country demand the scrapping\r\nof _the whole bad business of 'making Germany pay_.'\"[793]\r\n\r\nIndeed, when the interests of Germany were concerned, this paper, which\r\nLenin has described as \"our own organ,\" but which might still more truly\r\nbe claimed by Ludendorff and Stinnes, was quite ready to throw Socialism\r\nto the winds and plead the cause of capital. At the very moment that it\r\nwas advocating the Labour policy of a capital levy on all fortunes\r\nexceeding £5,000 in this country, the _Daily Herald_ waxed almost\r\ntearful over the iniquity of France in attempting to touch the pockets\r\nof German multi-millionaires whose profits, it went on to explain\r\nelaborately, were not nearly as huge as might appear in view of the\r\ndecline in the purchasing power of the mark. The decline in the\r\npurchasing power of the pound had, however, never been taken into\r\naccount when assessing the profits of British employers of labour.[794]\r\n\r\nWe have only to follow point by point the policy of the British Labour\r\nParty since the war to recognize that whilst the measures it advocated\r\nmight be of doubtful benefit to the workers, there could be no doubt\r\nwhatever of the benefit they would confer on Germany. With a million and\r\na quarter unemployed and large numbers of the working classes unable to\r\nfind homes, the professed representatives of Labour have persistently\r\nclamoured for the removal of restrictions on alien immigration and alien\r\nimports. So although through the Trade Unions the British worker was to\r\nbe rigorously protected against competition from his fellow-Briton, no\r\nobstacles were to be placed in the way of competition by foreign, and\r\nfrequently underpaid, labour. That this glaring betrayal of their\r\ninterests should not have raised a storm of resentment amongst the\r\nworking classes is surely evidence that the Marxian doctrine \"the\r\nemancipation of the working classes must be brought about by the working\r\nclasses themselves\"[795] has so far led to no great results. Emerson\r\ntruly observed: \"So far as a man thinks, he is free.\" The working\r\nclasses can never be free until they learn to think for themselves\r\ninstead of allowing their thinking to be done for them by the\r\nmiddle-class exploiters of Labour.\r\n\r\nThe hand of Germany behind Socialism must be apparent to all those who\r\ndo not deliberately shut their eyes to the fact, and it is significant\r\nto notice that the nearer Socialism approaches to Bolshevism the more\r\nmarked this influence becomes. Thus although certain Socialist groups,\r\nsuch as the Social Democratic Federation in England and the Socialist\r\nParty in France, have not become Germanized, the avowed Communists in\r\nall the Allied countries are strongly pro-German. This is the case even\r\nin France, where the Bolsheviks find fervent supporters in the group led\r\nby Marcel Cachin, Froissart, and Longuet, grandson of Karl Marx.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Bolshevist movement has indeed throughout owed a\r\ngreat deal of its efficiency to German co-operation, provided not only by\r\nthe Socialist but by the Monarchist elements in Germany. It is necessary\r\nin this connexion to understand the dual character of the German\r\nMonarchist party since the ending of the war. The great majority of its\r\nadherents, animated by nothing more reprehensible than the spirit of\r\nmilitarism and an aggressive form of patriotism that clings to the old\r\nformula of _Deutschland über alles_, are probably strangers to any\r\nintrigues, but behind this mass of honest Imperialists, and doubtless\r\nunknown to a great number, there lurk those sinister organizations the\r\nPan-German secret societies.\r\n\r\nMany of these, as for example the _Ostmarkenverein_, ostensibly\r\ninstituted for the defence of German interests on the Russian frontier,\r\nexisted before the war; indeed, there is little doubt that they have\r\ncontinued without a break since the days of the Tugendbund and have\r\nalways preserved their masonic and \"illuminized\" character. But since\r\nthe beginning of the Great War, and still more since the Armistice,\r\ntheir numbers have increased until in 1921 they were estimated to run\r\ninto three figures. Moreover, as in the time of Weishaupt, Bavaria is\r\nstill a centre for secret-society intrigue, and it was here that\r\nEscherich founded the _Einwohnerwehr_ sometimes known as the _Orgesch_\r\nor Organization Escherich, with Munich as its headquarters. The Orgesch\r\nwas followed by the formidable murder club known to all the world as the\r\nOrganization C or \"Consul,\" named after its founder, the famous Captain\r\nEhrhardt, whose nickname was \"_der Herr Consul_.\" During the year 1921\r\nno less than 400 political assassinations were reported in Germany and\r\nsaid to be the work of secret societies. Amongst the crimes attributed\r\nto the initiative of Organization C were the murders of Herr Erzberger\r\nand the attempt on the life of Herr Scheidemann. Eighty persons arrested\r\nfor complicity in the murder of Herr Rathenau were also said to be\r\nmembers of the same society.[796]\r\n\r\nBut as in the case of all secret societies, the visible leaders were not\r\nthe real hierarchy; behind this active body there existed an inner\r\ncircle organised on masonic lines, the Druidenorden, a name unknown to\r\nthe public, and behind this again another and still more secret circle\r\nwhich appears to be nameless. It is these inner rings which, whilst\r\nremaining Monarchist in Germany, work for other ends abroad, and are\r\nconnected with the world-revolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nThis alliance between the two extremes of ardent Monarchism and\r\nrevolutionary Socialism existed at the beginning of the war or even\r\nearlier, and, as is now well known, it was the Jewish Social Democrat,\r\nIsrael Lazarewitch, alias Helphandt alias Parvus, who arranged with the\r\nGerman General Staff for the passage of Lenin from Switzerland to\r\nRussia, accompanied by Karl Radek, the Austrian Jew deserter, and a\r\nnumber of other Jews.\r\n\r\nNow, Switzerland has been for hundreds of years a centre of\r\nrevolutionary and secret-society intrigue. As early as the sixteenth\r\ncentury the Pope, writing to the Kings of France and Spain, warned them\r\nthat Geneva was \"un foyer éternel de révolution,\" and Joseph de Maistre,\r\nquoting this letter in 1817, declared Geneva to be the metropolis of the\r\nrevolutionaries, whose art of deception he describes as \"the great\r\nEuropean secret.\"[797] Elsewhere, a year earlier, he had referred to\r\nIlluminism as the root of all the evil at work. It is now known that at\r\nthe moment de Maistre wrote these words an inner ring of\r\nrevolutionaries, claiming direct descent from Weishaupt and even from an\r\nearlier sect existing at the end of the fifteenth century, profited by\r\nthe fall of Napoleon I to reconstruct its organization and took up its\r\nheadquarters in Switzerland with branch offices in London and Paris. The\r\nsame secret ring of Illuminati is believed to have been intimately\r\nconnected with the organization of the Bolshevist revolution, although\r\nnone of the leading Bolsheviks are said to have been members of the\r\ninnermost circle, which is understood to consist of men belonging to the\r\nhighest intellectual and financial classes whose names remained\r\nabsolutely unknown. Outside this absolutely secret ring there existed,\r\nhowever, a semi-secret circle of high initiates of subversive societies\r\ndrawn from all over the world and belonging to various\r\nnationalities--German, Jewish, French, Russian, and even Japanese. This\r\ngroup, which might be described as the active ring of the inner circle,\r\nappears to have been in touch with, if not in control of, a committee\r\nwhich met in Switzerland to carry out the programme of the Third\r\nInternationale.\r\n\r\nIt was thus in Switzerland that at the same time high initiates of\r\nPan-German secret societies foregathered and that an active centre of\r\npro-German, anti-Entente, and even Bolshevist propaganda was\r\nestablished. These Germans, although Monarchists themselves, co-operated\r\nwith the secret revolutionary forces in stirring up trouble in the\r\ncountries of the Allies. At the same time the conferences of the Second\r\nInternationale, attended by members of the British I.L.P. took place in\r\nSwitzerland, and at one of these--the Berne Conference of 1919--the\r\ndelegates were entertained by a mysterious \"American\" millionaire, John\r\nde Kay, living himself in great style, paying for press service at the\r\nrate of 2,000 francs a day, lavishing money on the conference, and at\r\nthe same time subsidizing a Pacifist and Defeatest paper named _La\r\nFeuille_.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, then, to ignore the role of Germany in the present\r\noutbreak of world revolution. In the British White Paper on Bolshevism\r\nin Russia we find it stated by an Englishman who had been through the\r\nwhole of the Revolution in that country that:\r\n\r\n     The Germans initiated disturbances in order to reduce Russia to\r\n     chaos. They printed masses of paper money to finance their schemes;\r\n     the notes, of which I possess specimens, can be easily recognized\r\n     by a special mark.[798]\r\n\r\nWhat has Germany to say to all this? Simply that the promotion of\r\nBolshevism was a military \"necessity\" in order to bring about the\r\ndownfall of her opponents, but that the propaganda utilized by her was\r\nin reality of Jewish origin, and that Jewry, not Germany, was the real\r\nauthor of world revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how such a theory can be made to serve the cause of\r\nPan-Germanism. For if Germany can persuade us that the Jews alone were\r\nresponsible for the war and were also the sole authors of Bolshevism, we\r\nshall naturally be led to the conclusion that Germany is, after all,\r\ninnocent of the crimes attributed to her, and that our only safety lies\r\nin forgoing reparations, restoring her to her former power, and\r\ncoalescing with her against a common enemy. We shall therefore do well\r\nto accept with extreme caution advice on the Jewish question emanating\r\nfrom German sources, and to test the sincerity of the spirit in which it\r\nis offered by considering the relations which have hitherto existed\r\nbetween the Germans and the Jews.\r\n\r\nNow, Germany has long been the home of modern \"anti-Semitism.\" Although\r\nin every country and at every period, but more particularly in the East\r\nof Europe during the last century, the Jews have suffered from\r\nunpopularity, it was Germany that organized this aversion into a\r\ndefinite plan of campaign. If in Russia, Galicia, and Poland the Jews\r\nhave met with sporadic violence at the hands of the peasants, in Germany\r\nthey have been systematically held up by the authorities to hatred and\r\ncontempt. Luther, Kant, Fichte, Schopenhauer, Treitschke, successively\r\ninveighed against the Jewish race. Jews were denied admission to masonic\r\nlodges and to the rank of officers in the army, whilst society excluded\r\nthem up to the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nYet the extraordinary fact remains that of all nations the Germans have\r\nalways been the favourites of the Jews. Throughout the whole movement\r\nfor the unification of Germany under the ægis of Prussia, Jews played a\r\nleading part, and in the recent war Germany found in them some of her\r\nmost valuable allies. As Maximilian Harden recently pointed out: \"The\r\nservices of the Jews to Germany during the war were enormous. The\r\npatriotism of the Jews was beyond reproach, in many cases even ludicrous\r\nand offensive in its intensity.\" And in spite of \"anti-Semitism,\" Harden\r\ndeclares: \"There is a strong affinity between the German and the Jew.\"[799]\r\nTo the Ashkenazim Germany even more than Palestine has appeared\r\nthe Land of Promise. Thus some years before the war Professor Ludwig\r\nGeiger, leader of the Liberal Jews of Berlin, denounced \"Zionist\r\nsophisms\" in the words: \"The German Jew who has a voice in German\r\nliterature must, as he has been accustomed to for the last century and a\r\nhalf, look upon Germany alone as his fatherland, upon the German\r\nlanguage as his mother-tongue, and the future of that nation must remain\r\nthe only one upon which he bases his hopes.\"[800]\r\n\r\nHow are we to explain this unrequited devotion? Simply by the German\r\npolicy of enlisting every dynamic force in her service. She has known\r\nhow to use the Jews just as she has known how to use the Freemasons, the\r\nIlluminati, and the Socialists for the purpose of Pan-Germanism. From\r\nFrederick the Great, who employed the Jew Ephraim to coin false money,\r\nto William II, who kept in touch with Rathenau by means of a private\r\ntelephone wire, the rulers of Germany have always allowed them to\r\nco-operate in their schemes of world-domination. As the allies of\r\nBismarck, who used them freely to fill his war-chests, the Jews directed\r\nthe power of the secret societies in the interests of Germany; in 1871\r\nthe Jew Bloechreider acted as adviser to the new German Empire as to the\r\nbest method of wresting indemnities from France. And Germany, whilst\r\nheaping insults on the Jews, nevertheless fulfils certain conditions\r\nessential to Jewish enterprise. Unlike England and France, she has never\r\nallowed herself to be seriously weakened by democratic ideas, and\r\ntherefore to the Jews--as to British believers in autocracy--she\r\nrepresents the principle of stability.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Germany as the home of militarism offers a wide field for\r\nJewish speculation. We have only to couple together an aphorism of\r\nMirabeau's with one of Werner Sombart's to perceive the bond of union\r\nbetween the two races, thus: \"War is the national industry of Prussia\"\r\nand \"Wars are the Jews' harvests.\" As long ago as 1793 Anacharsis\r\nClootz, the apostle of universal brotherhood and defender of the Jewish\r\nrace, declared that if Germany were to be prevented from going to war\r\nthe Jews must be persuaded to withdraw their support from her military\r\nadventures:\r\n\r\n     War could not begin or last in Germany without the activity, the\r\n     intelligence, and the money of the Jews. Magazines and munitions of\r\n     all kinds are provided by Hebrew capitalists and all the subaltern\r\n     agents of military provisionment are of the same nation. We have\r\n     only to come to an understanding with our brothers, the Rabbis, to\r\n     produce astonishing, miraculous results.[801]\r\n\r\nMr. Ford, the American motor-car manufacturer, appears to have arrived\r\nat much the same conclusion expressed in the words recently attributed\r\nto him: \"We don't need the League of Nations to end war. Put under\r\ncontrol the fifty most wealthy Jewish financiers, who produce wars for\r\ntheir own profit, and wars will cease.\"[802]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Mr. Ford is reported to have said that the Jews who\r\nvoyaged with him in the Peace ship in 1915 \"went out of their way to\r\nconvince\" him of \"the direct relations between the International Jew and\r\nthe war\": they \"went into details to tell me the means by which the Jews\r\ncontrolled the war--how they had the money, how they had cornered all\r\nthe basic materials needed to fight the war,\" etc.[803]\r\n\r\nWithout in any way absolving Germany from the crime of the war, it is\r\nnecessary to take this secondary factor into consideration if peace\r\nbetween the nations is to be established. For as long as the lust of war\r\nlingers in the hearts of the Germans and the lust of gain at the price\r\nof human suffering lingers in the hearts of the Jews, both races will\r\nremain necessary to each other and the hideous nightmare of war will\r\ncontinue to brood over the world.\r\n\r\nThere is then a great deal of truth in the Socialist phrase\r\n\"Capitalists' Wars,\" although not in the sense they attribute to it. For\r\nit will be noticed that the Capitalists who are most instrumental in\r\nmaking wars are precisely those whom the Socialists are always careful\r\nto shield from blame. The following incident will illustrate this point.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Social Democratic Federation Mr. Adolphe Smith moved\r\na resolution appealing to the organized workers of Great Britain--\r\n\r\n     Not to permit themselves in the supposed interests of their\r\n     fellow-workers in other countries, to be used by sinister financial\r\n     and militarist influences merely to weaken the Entente nations in\r\n     the present critical situation, and urging them to keep careful\r\n     watch against such manoeuvres on the part of pro-German\r\n     international financiers, who were able to exercise considerable\r\n     reactionary influence among the wealthy and official classes in\r\n     this country.[804]\r\n\r\nMr. Hyndman added that \"the most serious danger by which we were\r\nthreatened was from the most powerful group of capitalists in Europe\r\nheaded by Hugo Stinnes and backed by Hindenburg, Ludendorff, and the\r\nmilitarist party in Germany.\" This resolution was opposed by a member of\r\nthe Parliamentary Labour Party and eventually withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe connexion between German Imperialism, International Finance,\r\nIlluminism, Bolshevism, and certain sections of British Socialism is\r\nthus apparent. Is Germany then the secret power behind the thing we call\r\nBolshevism? Are Illuminism and Pan-Germanism one and the same thing? To\r\nthis hypothesis two objections present themselves: firstly, that the\r\nspirit of Illuminism and Bolshevism existed, as we have seen in earlier\r\nchapters of this book, long before modern Germany came into existence;\r\nand secondly, that Germany herself is not entirely free from the\r\ncontagion. For although the danger of Bolshevism in Germany has been\r\ndoubtless greatly exaggerated in order to prevent the Allies from\r\npressing their demands for disarmament and reparations, nevertheless\r\nBolshevism under its illuminated name of Spartacism cannot be regarded\r\nas a movement entirely staged for the deception of Europe. Moreover,\r\njust as in the countries of the Allies it has shown itself, under the\r\nguise of Pacifism, savagely anti-national and pro-German, so in Germany,\r\nas also in Hungary, it turned Pacifism to the opposite purpose by\r\nprofessing sympathy at moments with the Allies.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that besides Pan-Germanism there is another power at\r\nwork, a power far older, that seeks to destroy all national spirit, all\r\nordered government in every country, Germany included. What is this\r\npower? A large body of opinion replies: the Jewish power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nTHE REAL JEWISH PERIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the immense problem of the Jewish Power, perhaps the most\r\nimportant problem with which the modern world is confronted, it is\r\nnecessary to divest oneself of all prejudices and to enquire in a spirit\r\nof scientific detachment whether any definite proof exists that a\r\nconcerted attempt is being made by Jewry to achieve world-domination and\r\nto obliterate the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nThat such a purpose has existed amongst the Jews in the past has been\r\nshown throughout the earlier chapters of this book. The conception of\r\nthe Jews as the Chosen People who must eventually rule the world forms\r\nindeed the basis of Rabbinical Judaism.\r\n\r\nIt is customary in this country to say that we should respect the Jewish\r\nreligion, and this would certainly be our duty were the Jewish religion\r\nfounded, as is popularly supposed, solely on the Old Testament. For\r\nalthough we do not consider ourselves bound to observe the ritual of the\r\nPentateuch, we find no fault with the Jews for carrying out what they\r\nconceive to be their religious duties. Moreover, although the Old\r\nTestament depicts the Jews as a favoured race--a conception which we\r\nbelieve to have been superseded by the Christian dispensation, whereby\r\nall men are declared equal in the sight of God--nevertheless it does\r\ncontain a very lofty law of righteousness applicable to all mankind. It\r\nis because of their universality that the books of Job and Ecclesiastes,\r\nas also many passages in the Psalms, in Isaiah, and the minor prophets,\r\nhave made an undying appeal to the human race. But the Jewish religion\r\nnow takes its stand on the Talmud rather than on the Bible. \"The modern\r\nJew,\" one of its latest Jewish translators observes, \"is the product of\r\nthe Talmud.\"[805] The Talmud itself accords to the Bible only a\r\nsecondary place. Thus the Talmudic treatise Soferim says: \"The Bible is\r\nlike water, the Mischna is like wine, and the Gemara is like spiced\r\nwine.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the Talmud is not a law of righteousness for all mankind, but a\r\nmeticulous code applying to the Jew alone. No human being outside the\r\nJewish race could possibly go to the Talmud for help or comfort. One\r\nmight look through its pages in vain for any such splendid rule of life\r\nas that given by the prophet Micah: \"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is\r\ngood; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to\r\nlove mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" In the Talmud, on the\r\ncontrary, as Drach points out, \"the precepts of justice, of equity, of\r\ncharity towards one's neighbour, are not only not applicable with regard\r\nto the Christian, but constitute a crime in anyone who would act\r\ndifferently.... The Talmud expressly forbids one to save a non-Jew from\r\ndeath, ... to restore lost goods, etc., to him, to have pity on him.\"[806]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow far the Talmud has contributed to the anti-social tendencies of\r\nmodern Judaism is shown by the fact that the Karaites living in the\r\nsouth of Russia, the only body of Jews which takes its stand on the\r\nBible, and not on the Talmud,--of which it only accepts such portions as\r\nare in accordance with Bible teaching--have always shown themselves good\r\nsubjects of the Russian Empire, and have therefore enjoyed equal rights\r\nwith the Russian people around them. Catherine the Great particularly\r\nfavoured the Karaites.\r\n\r\nThus even the Jews are not unanimous in supporting the Talmud; indeed,\r\nas we have already seen, many Jews have protested against it as a\r\nbarrier between themselves and the rest of the human race.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the Cabala, still more than in the Talmud, that the Judaic\r\ndream of world-domination recurs with the greatest persistence. The\r\nZohar indeed refers to this as a _fait accompli_, explaining that \"the\r\nFeast of Tabernacles is the period when Israel triumphs over the other\r\npeople of the world; that is why during this feast we seize the Loulab\r\n[branches of trees tied together] and carry it as a trophy to show that\r\nwe have conquered all the other peoples known as 'populace' and that we\r\ndominate them.\"[807] God is, however, asked to accord these other\r\npeoples a certain share of blessings, \"so that occupied with this share\r\nthey shall not participate nor mingle with the joy of Israel when he\r\ncalls down blessings from on high.\" The situation may thus be compared\r\nwith that of a king who, wishing to give a feast to his special friends,\r\nfinds his house invaded by importunate governors demanding admittance.\r\n\"What then does the king do? He orders the governors to be served with\r\nbeef and vegetables, which are common food, and then sits down to table\r\nwith his friends and has the most delicious dishes served.\"[808]\r\n\r\nBut this is nothing to the feasting that is to take place when the\r\nMessianic era arrives. After the return of the Jews from all nations and\r\nparts of the world to Palestine, the Messiah, we are told in the Talmud,\r\nwill entertain them at a gorgeous banquet, where they will be seated at\r\ngolden tables and regaled with wine from Adam's wine-cellar. The first\r\ncourse is to consist of a roasted ox named Behemoth, so immense that\r\nevery day it eats up the grass upon a thousand hills; the second of a\r\nmonstrous fish Leviathan; the third of a female Leviathan boiled and\r\npickled; the fourth of a gigantic roast fowl known as Barjuchne, of\r\nwhich the egg alone was so enormous that when it fell out of the nest it\r\ncrushed three hundred tall cedars and the white overflowed threescore\r\nvillages. This course is to be followed up by \"the most splendid and\r\npompous Dessert\" that can be procured, including fruit from the Tree of\r\nLife and \"the Pomegranates of Eden which are preserved for the Just.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the banquet \"God will entertain the company at a ball\"; He\r\nHimself will sit in the midst of them, and everyone will point Him out\r\nwith his finger, saying: \"Behold, this is our God: we have waited for\r\nHim, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.\"[809]\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth-century commentator, whose summary of these passages we\r\nquote, goes on to observe:\r\n\r\n     But let us see a little after what manner the Jews are to live in\r\n     their ancient Country under the Administration of the Messiah. In\r\n     the First Place, the strange Nations, which they shall suffer to\r\n     live, shall build them Houses and Cities, till them Ground, and\r\n     plant them Vineyards; and all this, without so much as looking for\r\n     any Reward of their Labour. These surviving Nations will likewise\r\n     voluntarily offer them all their Wealth and Furniture: And Princes\r\n     and Nobles shall attend them; and be ready at their Nod to pay them\r\n     all Manner of Obedience; while they themselves shall be surrounded\r\n     with Grandeur and Pleasure, appearing abroad in Apparel glittering\r\n     with Jewels like Priests of the Unction, consecrated to God....\r\n\r\n     In a word, the felicity of this Holy Nation, in the Times of the\r\n     Messiah, will be such, that the exalted Condition of it cannot\r\n     enter into the Conception of Man; much less can it be couched in\r\n     human Expression. This is what the Rabbis say of it. But the\r\n     intelligent reader will doubtless pronounce it the Paradise of\r\n     Fools.[810]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that this conception of the manner in which\r\nthe return to Palestine is to be carried out has descended to certain of\r\nthe modern colonists. Sir George Adam Smith, after watching Zionism at\r\nwork in 1918, wrote:\r\n\r\n     On visiting a recently established Jewish colony in the north-east\r\n     of the land, round which a high wall had been built by the\r\n     munificent patron, I found the colonists sitting in its shade\r\n     gambling away the morning, while groups of _fellahin_ at a poor\r\n     wage did the cultivation for them. I said that this was surely not\r\n     the intention of their patron in helping them to settle on land of\r\n     their own. A Jew replied to me in German: \"Is it not written: The\r\n     sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and vinedressers?\" I know\r\n     that such delinquencies have become the exception in Jewish\r\n     colonization of Palestine, but they are symptomatic of dangers\r\n     which will have to be guarded against.[811]\r\n\r\nThe fellahin may, however, consider themselves lucky to be allowed to\r\nlive at all, for, according to several passages in the Cabala, all the\r\n_goyim_ are to be swept off the face of the earth when Israel comes into\r\nits own. Thus the Zohar relates that the Messiah will declare war on the\r\nwhole world and all the kings of the world will end by declaring war on\r\nthe Messiah. But \"the Holy One, blessed be He, will display His force\r\nand exterminate them from the world.\"[812] Then:\r\n\r\n     Happy will be the lot of Israel, whom the Holy One, blessed be He,\r\n     has chosen from amongst the _goyim_ of whom the Scriptures say:\r\n     \"Their work is but vanity, it is an illusion at which we must\r\n     laugh; they will all perish when God visits them in His wrath.\" At\r\n     the moment when the Holy One, blessed be He, will exterminate all\r\n     the _goyim_ of the world, Israel alone will subsist, even as it is\r\n     written: \"The Lord alone will appear great on that day.\"[813]\r\n\r\nThe hope of world-domination is therefore not an idea attributed to the\r\nJews by \"anti-Semites,\" but a very real and essential part of their\r\ntraditions. What then of their attitude to Christianity in the past? We\r\nhave already seen that hatred of the person and teaching of Christ did\r\nnot end at Golgotha, but was kept alive by the Rabbis and perpetuated in\r\nthe Talmud and the Toledot Yeshu. The Cabala also contains passages\r\nreferring both to Christ and to Mohammed so unspeakably foul that it\r\nwould be impossible to quote them here.\r\n\r\nBut it will be urged: the Jews of Western Europe to-day know nothing of\r\nthe Cabala. This may be so, yet imperceptibly the Cabala has moulded the\r\nmind of the Jew. As a modern Jewish writer has declared:\r\n\r\n     [Kabbalism] has contributed to the formation of modern Judaism,\r\n     for, without the influence of the Kabbala, Judaism to-day might\r\n     have been one-sided, lacking in warmth and imagination. Indeed, so\r\n     deeply has it penetrated into the body of the faith that many ideas\r\n     and prayers are now immovably rooted in the general body of\r\n     orthodox doctrine and practice. This element has not only become\r\n     incorporated, but it has fixed its hold on the affections of the\r\n     Jews and cannot be eradicated.[814]\r\n\r\nIt is thus not in the law of Moses thundered from Sinai, not in the dry\r\nritual of the Talmud, but in the stupendous imaginings of the Cabala,\r\nthat the real dreams and aspirations of Jewry have been transmitted\r\nthrough the ages. Belief in the coming Messiah may burn low, but faith\r\nin the final triumph of Israel over the other nations of the world still\r\nglows in the hearts of a race nurtured on this hope from time\r\nimmemorial. Even the free-thinking Jew must unconsciously react to the\r\npromptings of this vast and ancient ambition. As a modern French writer\r\nhas expressed it:\r\n\r\n     Assuredly sectarian Freethinkers swarm, who flatter themselves on\r\n     having borrowed nothing from the synagogue and on hating equally\r\n     Jehovah and Jesus. But the modern Jewish world is itself also\r\n     detached from any supernatural belief, and the Messianic tradition,\r\n     of which it preserves the cult, reduces itself to considering the\r\n     Jewish race as the veritable Messiah[815].\r\n\r\nSome colour is lent to this statement by an article which recently\r\nappeared in the Jewish press, in which it is explained that, according\r\nto the teaching of the \"Liberal Jewish Synagogue,\" the beautiful\r\npassages in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah concerning \"the Man of\r\nSorrows acquainted with grief,\" usually supposed by Christians to relate\r\nto the promised Messiah, are interpreted to modern Jewish youth as\r\nrelating to Israel and signifying that Israel's \"sufferings were caused\r\nby the sins of other nations,\" who thus \"escaped the suffering they\r\ndeserved.\" Consequently \"Israel has suffered for the sake of the whole\r\nworld[816].\" How this amazing pretension can be maintained in view of\r\nthe perpetual denunciations of the Israelites throughout the whole of\r\nthe Old Testament is difficult to imagine. On their entry into Canaan\r\nthey were distinctly told by Moses that the Lord their God had not given\r\nthem \"this good land\" on account of their righteousness or the\r\nuprightness of their hearts[817]; long afterwards Daniel declared that\r\nall Israel had transgressed the law of God[818]; Nehemiah showed that on\r\naccount of their rebellion and disobedience they had been delivered into\r\nthe hands of their enemies[819]. Isaiah spoke of the iniquities of Judah\r\nin burning words:\r\n\r\n     Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of\r\n     evildoers, children that are corruptors!... Wash your, make you\r\n     clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes;\r\n     cease to do evil; learn to do well, etc.[820]\r\n\r\nThus even the Word of God itself is powerless to mitigate the immense\r\nmegalomania of the Jewish race. It is doubtful indeed whether by the\r\nmajority of Jews the Bible is now regarded as divinely inspired. \"The\r\nten commandments which _we_ gave to mankind[821]\" is a phrase typical of\r\nthe manner in which Israel now arrogates to itself the sole authorship\r\nof the Scriptures. The deification of humanity by the Freemasons of the\r\nGrand Orient finds its counterpart in the deification of Israel by the\r\nmodern Jew.\r\n\r\nIt is here that we must surely see the cause of much of the suffering\r\nthe Jews have endured in the past. No one of course would justify the\r\ncruelty with which they have frequently been treated; nevertheless to\r\nmaintain there was no provocation on the part of the Jews would be\r\nabsurd. A race that has always considered itself entitled to occupy a\r\nprivileged position amongst the nations of the world must inevitably\r\nmeet with resentment, and in a primitive age or population resentment is\r\napt to find a vent in violence shocking to the civilized mind. Moreover,\r\nto represent the Jews as a gentle long-suffering people, always the\r\nvictims but never the perpetrators of violence, is absolutely contrary\r\nto historic fact. In the dark ages of the past the Jews showed\r\nthemselves perfectly capable of cruelties not only towards other races\r\nbut towards each other. One of the first pogroms recorded in the\r\nChristian era was carried out by the Jews themselves. The Jewish\r\nhistorian Josephus describes the reign of \"lawlessness and barbarity\"\r\nthat was inaugurated about the middle of the first century A.D. by the\r\nband of assassins known as the Sicarii, who infested the country round\r\nJerusalem and, by means of little daggers that they wore concealed\r\nbeneath their garments, \"slew men in the daytime and in the midst of the\r\ncity, especially at the festivals when they mixed with the multitude.\"\r\nDuring one night raid on the small town of Engaddi they massacred more\r\nthan seven hundred women and children.[822] And Josephus goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     Somehow, indeed, that was a time most fertile in all manner of\r\n     wicked practices among the Jews, insomuch that no kind of villainy\r\n     was then left undone; nor could anyone so much as devise any bad\r\n     thing that was new if he wished. So deeply were they all infected,\r\n     both privately and publicly, and vied with one another who should\r\n     run the greatest lengths in impiety towards God, and in unjust\r\n     actions towards their neighbours, men in power oppressing the\r\n     multitude, and the multitude earnestly endeavouring to destroy men\r\n     in power.[823]\r\n\r\nIt is futile then to maintain as do the Jews and their friends--for the\r\npro-Jew is frequently _plus royaliste que le roi_--that all the faults\r\nof the modern Jew are to be attributed to bitterness engendered by\r\npersecution. Judaism has always contained an element of cruelty[824]\r\nwhich finds expression in the Talmud. It is from the Talmud, not from\r\nthe Mosaic law, that the inhuman methods of Jewish slaughtering are\r\nderived.[825] The Talmud likewise gives the most horrible directions for\r\ncarrying out capital punishment, particularly with regard to women, by\r\nthe methods of stoning, burning, choking, or slaying with the sword. The\r\nvictim condemned to be burnt is to have a scarf wound round his neck,\r\nthe two ends pulled tightly by the executioners whilst his mouth is\r\nforced open with pincers and a lighted string thrust into it \"so that it\r\nflows down through his inwards and shrinks his entrails.\"[826]\r\n\r\nIt will be said that all this belongs to the past. True, the practice\r\nhere described may be considered obsolete, but the spirit of cruelty and\r\nintolerance that dictated it is still alive. One has only to study the\r\nmodern Jewish press to realize the persecution to which Jews are\r\nsubjected from members of their own race should they infringe one\r\nfraction of the Jewish code.\r\n\r\nIf, then, \"the modern Jew is the product of the Talmud,\" it is here that\r\nwe must see the principal obstacle to Jewish progress. It is said that\r\nIsaac Disraeli, the father of Lord Beaconsfield, gave as his reason for\r\nwithdrawing from the Synagogue that Rabbinical Judaism with its\r\nunyielding laws and fettering customs \"cuts off the Jews from the great\r\nfamily of mankind.\"[827] Such a system is indeed absolutely\r\nincompatible not only with Christian teaching but with the secular ideas\r\nof Western civilization. The attitude it adopts towards women would be\r\nin itself sufficient to justify this assertion. The Jewish daily prayer,\r\n\"Blessed be Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, that Thou has\r\nnot made me a woman!\"[828] is a ludicrous anachronism in the present\r\nage. According to the Talmud a service can take place in the Synagogue\r\nonly if ten persons are present, which number ensures the presence of\r\nGod in the assembly. Drach explains however that these persons must all\r\nbe men. \"If then there were nine men and a million women there could be\r\nno assembly, for the reason that women are nothing. But there arrives\r\n[on the scene] only one small boy of thirteen years and a day, at once\r\nthere can be a holy assembly and, according to our Doctors, it is\r\npermitted to God to be present[829].\"\r\n\r\nWhen therefore we say that we must respect the Jewish religion we\r\ncannot, if we know anything about it, mean that we respect that portion\r\nof it which is founded on the Rabbinical traditions of the Talmud and\r\nthe Cabala, but only that ethical law set forth in the Old Testament, to\r\nwhich right-living Jews have faithfully adhered and which is largely in\r\naccord with Christian teaching.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget that Rabbinical Judaism is the declared and implacable\r\nenemy of Christianity. Hatred of Christianity and of the person of\r\nChrist is not a matter of remote history, nor can it be regarded as the\r\nresult of persecution; it forms an integral part of Rabbinical tradition\r\nwhich originated before any persecution of the Jews by Christians had\r\ntaken place, and has continued in our country long after all such\r\npersecution has ended.\r\n\r\nIt is here that we cannot fail to detect the origin of much of that\r\nvirulent anti-Christian teaching that is being disseminated in our midst\r\nto-day. This teaching will be observed to follow three lines, of which\r\nthe course has been traced throughout this book. These consist in\r\ndesecrating the Christian tradition by declaring that Christ was either\r\n(_a_) a myth, (_b_) a purely human teacher endowed with superior virtue\r\nand knowledge of natural laws, (_c_) a crazy fanatic[830] or a\r\nmalefactor. The first two theories are, as we have seen, those held by\r\nsecret societies; the last is essentially Jewish. It is true that there\r\nis now a movement amongst the more enlightened Jews to recognize Jesus\r\nas a great teacher; so far, unfortunately, this is met by bitter\r\nhostility from the rest, and in the current Jewish press contemptuous\r\nand even blasphemous references to Christ and the Christian faith\r\nfrequently occur. The fact that here in England, for nearly three\r\nhundred years, the Jews have been allowed to dwell in peace and carry\r\nout their religious rites unmolested, that they have been admitted to\r\nsociety, to masonic lodges, and to all offices of State and have met\r\nwith increasing tolerance and favour, has done nothing to moderate that\r\nhatred of Christianity inculcated throughout nineteen centuries of\r\nRabbinical teaching. Thus, for example, under the heading of \"What\r\nChristianity has Meant,\" we read in a modern Jewish periodical:\r\n\r\n     We are thinking of what Christianity as an institution has meant to\r\n     us Jews. The twenty centuries of its existence have been coeval\r\n     with the long-drawn tragedy of the Jew's dispersal among the\r\n     nations.... What kindliness and consideration we have received at\r\n     the hands of Christianity has for the most part been tendered with\r\n     the lure of the baptismal font. To the extent to which\r\n     Christianity's embodiment, the Church, has been puissant has the\r\n     Jewish tragedy deepened. Only when and where the Church has been\r\n     weak has life been tolerable for the Jew.... Hatred of the Jew,\r\n     anti-Jewish outbursts and anti-Semitic campaigns, are traceable to\r\n     nothing so surely as to antipathy to the Jew which has been inbred\r\n     by Christianity.... There is thus precious little about which the\r\n     Jew has for rejoicing and gladness in the institution of\r\n     Christianity, etc.[831]\r\n\r\nThe most cursory study of history would reveal the falseness of this\r\ncontention. Antipathy to the Jew began long before the Christian era; in\r\nEgypt, Persia, and Rome he became, whether just or not, the object of\r\nsuspicion to rulers. The reason given by Pharaoh for oppressing the\r\nIsraelites was that if they were allowed to grow too powerful they might\r\njoin themselves to the enemy in time of war[832]; the Emperors of Rome\r\nregarded them as a turbulent element; Mohammed declared: \"Their aim will\r\nbe to abet disorder on the earth, but God loveth not the abettors of\r\ndisorder.\"[833] Meanwhile, the antipathy shown by the \"people\" in every\r\ncountry was mainly based on economic grounds. It was not simply the\r\npossession of wealth--which according to the Socialist creed should\r\njustify any amount of hatred--but the manner in which it was acquired\r\nand the arrogance with which it was displayed that roused popular\r\nfeeling against the Jews. An Arab Fakih, Abu Ishak of Elvira, thus\r\nwarned his master of the growing power of the Jews in Spain in the\r\nmiddle of the eleventh century A.D.:\r\n\r\n     The Jews, contemptible outcasts, have become great lords, and their\r\n     pride and arrogance know no bounds.... Take not such men for thy\r\n     ministers, but abandon them to curses, for the whole earth crieth\r\n     out against them--ere long it will quake and we shall all perish.\r\n     Turn thine eyes to other lands and behold how the Jews are treated\r\n     as dogs, and kept apart....\r\n\r\n     I came to Granada, and there I beheld the Jews reigning. They had\r\n     parcelled out the provinces and the capital between them:\r\n     everywhere one of these accursed ruled. They collected the taxes,\r\n     they made good cheer, they were sumptuously clad, while your\r\n     garments, O Moslems, were old and worn-out. All the secrets of\r\n     state were known to them; yet is it folly to put trust in traitors!\r\n     While believers ate the bread of poverty, they dined delicately in\r\n     the palace.... How can we thrive if we live in the shade and the\r\n     Jews dazzle us with the glory of their pride?[834]\r\n\r\nIn mediæval France the chief cause for complaint against the Jews is\r\nthat of not working with their hands but of enriching themselves by\r\n\"excessive usury.\" In the fifteenth century the Strasbourg preacher\r\nGeyler asks: \"Are the Jews above the Christians? Why will they not work\r\nwith their hands?... practising usury is not working. It is exploiting\r\nothers whilst remaining idle.\"[835] Such quotations as these might be\r\nmultiplied _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nTo attribute the persecution of the Jews to Christianity is therefore\r\nludicrous. That in a less enlightened age the Church should have adopted\r\nrigorous measures--although no more rigorous than their own laws\r\ndemanded--against those Jews who practised magic and witchcraft must\r\nappear deplorable to the modern mind, but so must many other phases of\r\nmediæval life. Why then hark back perpetually to the past? If the Jews\r\nwere persecuted in a less enlightened age, so were many other sections\r\nof the community. Catholics were persecuted, Protestants were\r\npersecuted, men were placed in the stocks for minor offences, scolding\r\nwomen were ducked in the village pond. But if all these cruelties of the\r\ndark ages are to be remembered and perpetuated on the plan of a tribal\r\nblood-feud, what peace can there be for the world? The disastrous\r\nresults of this tendency were seen in the Irish Intellectuals, nourished\r\nfrom infancy on the story of Ireland's wrongs, who, instead of sanely\r\nfacing present problems, unhinged their minds by brooding on historic\r\ngrievances, thereby sealing their own doom and plunging their country\r\ninto ruin. So, too, the enraged Feminists, harking back to injustices\r\nthat had long ceased to exist, embittered their lives by proclaiming\r\nthemselves the eternal enemies of Man. Emerson, the prophet of sanity,\r\ndeclared: \"The only ballast I know is a respect to the present hour.\"\r\nIt is for lack of this ballast that the Jews have become victims of a\r\nfanaticism in which Christians from a mistaken idea of kindness have\r\nfrequently encouraged them. In reality nothing is more cruel than to\r\nencourage in the minds of a nervous race the idea of persecution; true\r\nkindness to the Jews would consist in urging them to throw off memories\r\nof past martyrdom and to enter healthfully into the enjoyment of their\r\npresent blessings, which are the direct outcome of Christian\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what Christianity has in reality done for the Jews. If\r\nso much is to be said about the persecutions they have endured, what of\r\nthe extraordinary indulgence shown them as the result of Christian\r\nrespect for the Bible? For hundreds of years Christian school children\r\nhave been brought up on Old Testament history and Christian\r\ncongregations have listened sympathetically to the story of Israel's\r\nsufferings and hopes of final restoration. All the support lent to\r\nZionism arose from this tradition. Christianity, then, so reviled by the\r\nJews, has been their greatest protection. If Christianity goes, the\r\nwhole theory that the Jews were once the Chosen People goes with it as\r\nfar as Gentiles are concerned, and the Jewish race, divested of its halo\r\nof divine favour, will have to be judged on its own merits.\r\n\r\nIn our own country, the Chosen People theory has in fact been carried to\r\nthe point of superstition--a superstition immensely advantageous to the\r\nJews--which consists in interpreting the passage of Scripture containing\r\nthe promise made to Abraham, \"I will bless them that bless thee, and\r\ncurse them that curseth thee,\" as meaning that favour shown to the\r\nJews--who form merely a fraction of the seed of Abraham--brings with it\r\npeculiar blessings. In reality it would be easier to show by history\r\nthat countries and rulers who have protected the Jews have frequently\r\nmet with disaster. France banished the Jews in 1394 and again in 1615,\r\nand did not readmit them in large numbers till 1715-19, so that they\r\nwere absent throughout the most glorious period in French history--the\r\n_Grand Siècle_ of Louis XIV--whilst their return coincided with the\r\nRegency, from which moment the monarchy of France may be said to have\r\ndeclined. England likewise banished the Jews in 1290, and it was during\r\nthe three and a half centuries they remained in exile that she was known\r\nas \"Merrie England.\" The fact that their return in force in 1664 was\r\nfollowed the next year by the Great Plague and the year after by the\r\nGreat Fire of London would not appear to indicate that the Jews\r\nnecessarily bring good fortune to the land that protects them. The truth\r\nis, of course, that kindness to any portion of the human race brings its\r\nown reward in the form of moral improvement in the individual or nation\r\nthat performs it, but no more benefit attaches to philanthropy when\r\nexercised towards the Jew than towards the Chinaman.\r\n\r\nI would urge, then, that the Jewish problem should be approached neither\r\nin the spirit of superstitious pro-Semitism nor in the bitter spirit of\r\n\"anti-Semitism,\" but with a sanity worthy of an enlightened age. To\r\nquote again the words of Bernard Lazare, let us enquire what part \"the\r\nJew, considering his spirit, his character, the nature of his philosophy\r\nand his religion,\" may now be taking \"in revolutionary processes and\r\nmovements.\" Is there, then, any evidence that there exists amongst Jewry\r\nto-day an organized conspiracy having for its objects world-domination\r\nand the destruction of Christianity such as the famous _Protocols of the\r\nElders of Zion_ suggest?[836]\r\n\r\nThe theory of a Jewish world-conspiracy does not, of course, rest on the\r\nevidence of Protocols. To judge by the pæans of joy that rang through\r\nthe press after the publication of the _Times_ articles, one would\r\nimagine that with the so-called \"refutation\" of this one document the\r\nwhole case against the Jews had collapsed and that the \"anti-Semites\"\r\nmust be for ever silenced. But the arguments of the Jews and their\r\nfriends go further than this; not only do they claim that there is no\r\nJewish conspiracy, but no world-plot of any kind. This contention they\r\nhad indeed maintained from the beginning, and Mr. Lucien Wolf, in his\r\nearliest \"refutation\" of the Protocols, derided the exponents of the\r\nsecret-society danger as vehemently as he derided the perfidious author\r\nof the Jewish Peril. It will in fact always be noticed that references\r\nto the Illuminati meet with almost as much resentment from the Jewish\r\npress as allusions of a directly \"anti-Semitic\" character. Barruel, who\r\nrefused to incriminate the Jews, and de Malet, who never referred to\r\nthem at all, are denounced by Mr. Lucien Wolf no less as scaremongers\r\nthan Gougenot des Mousseaux or Chabauty. To suggest that any Hidden Hand\r\nhas ever been at work in the world is to raise immediately a storm of\r\nJewish protest.\r\n\r\nYet intelligent Jews must be well aware that, whether secret societies\r\nhave contributed as much to past revolutions as these writers believed,\r\ntheir existence and their very real influence is not a matter of surmise\r\nbut of historical fact. No one ever warned the British public more\r\ndistinctly of the danger they presented or of the role the Jews were\r\nplaying in them than Disraeli, whose famous words have been quoted so\r\nfrequently in this connexion: \"The world is governed by very different\r\npersonages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the\r\nscenes.\" What is this but a clear recognition of the Hidden Hand? Why,\r\nthen, is Disraeli not included with Barruel, Robison, de Malet, and Des\r\nMousseaux in Mr. Wolf's list of scaremongers? Is it because Disraeli\r\npointed the moral that, Jews being so dangerous, they should be\r\nemployed?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf, then, leading Jews persist in villifying everyone who reiterates the\r\nwarnings uttered by so eminent a member of their race, it is inevitable\r\nthat they should come to be suspected of having some interest in\r\nsuppressing further revelations.\r\n\r\nSetting all such evidence as the Protocols completely aside, let us\r\nexamine the reasons for believing in the exisence of a Jewish\r\nworld-conspiracy. Now, we know for certain that the five powers before\r\nreferred to--Grand Orient Masonry, Theosophy, Pan-Germanism,\r\nInternational Finance, and Social Revolution--have a very real existence\r\nand exercise a very definite influence on the affairs of the world. Here\r\nwe are not dealing with hypothesis but with facts based on documentary\r\nevidence. We know in each case the names of many of the leaders, their\r\nmethods of organization, their centres of direction, and the aims they\r\nare pursuing. But with regard to the Jewish power we cannot proceed with\r\nthe same certainty. We cannot cite the names of the leaders or the\r\ncentres of direction, we cannot produce documentary evidence as to their\r\nmethods of organization or their final aims. The very existence of such\r\na power, in the sense of a united and organized body of Jews working for\r\nthe destruction of Christianity and the existing social system, is still\r\na matter of speculation and not of known fact. Investigations into the\r\nactivities of such groups as the B'nai B'rith, Poale Zion, the Jewish\r\nBund, and the Weltverband (or Jewish International Union of Socialists),\r\nmight however throw much light on this question. The custom of printing\r\ntheir pidgin German, known as Yiddish, in Hebrew characters provides the\r\nJews with a more or less secret code by means of which their ideas and\r\naspirations are concealed from the great mass of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nWhether then the Jewish power is unified or not, Jews are to be found\r\nco-operating with, if not directing, all the five powers of which the\r\nexistence is known. Thus Jews have long played a leading part in Grand\r\nOrient Masonry[837] and predominate in the upper degrees. As we have\r\nalready seen, Freemasonry is always said to be subversive in Roman\r\nCatholic countries. It will also be noticed that in countries where\r\nFreemasonry is subversive, Jews are usually less conspicuous in the\r\nrevolutionary movement than in countries where Freemasonry is either\r\nnon-existent or constitutional. Thus in France the masonic peril is much\r\nmore generally recognized than the Jewish peril; in Italy the Freemasons\r\nhave been banned by Mussolini, but the Jews are not regarded by him as a\r\nparticular danger; in Portugal it was the Freemasons rather than the\r\nJews who made the recent revolutions. In Hungary, however, the\r\nrevolutionaries were principally both Jews and Freemasons. On the other\r\nhand, in England, Germany, and America, where Freemasonry is not\r\nsubversive, the Jewish question is more apparent. All this would suggest\r\nthat either Freemasonry is the cover under which the Jews, like the\r\nIlluminati, prefer to work, so that where the cover is not available\r\nthey are obliged to come out more into the open, or that Grand Orient\r\nMasonry is the directing power which employs Jews as agents in those\r\ncountries where it cannot work on its own account.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of Jews in the ranks of \"Aurora\" has already been\r\nindicated, as also the influence of the Jewish Cabala in the teaching of\r\nTheosophy and Rosicrucianism. But it is important that the latter point\r\nshould be further emphasized in connexion with the craze for occultism\r\nthat is spreading through society. Ragon has said: \"The Cabala is the\r\nkey of all occult sciences\"; therefore in this field of experiment the\r\nGentile must always be at a disadvantage with the Jew. Indeed Mr. Waite,\r\nwho certainly cannot be suspected of \"anti-Semitism,\" goes so far as to\r\nsuggest that the gift of ceremonial magic was \"the answer of Jewry to\r\nChristendom as a counter-blast\" to \"centuries of persecution.\"[838] It\r\nwould be well if every Gentile who has been tempted to dabble in\r\noccultism were to realize this source of inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe rôle of Jews in social revolution and particularly in Bolshevism\r\nhardly needs comment. Yet since the Jewish press has chosen to deny this\r\nlast and very obvious fact and still persists in setting down to\r\nprejudice or \"anti-Semitism\" a mere statement of facts, it may be well\r\nto quote here a few official statements on the subject which admit of no\r\ndenial.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it must be remembered that the founder and patron saint of\r\nBolshevism was the Jew Karl Marx, and that it was the Anarchist Bakunin,\r\nnot the Duke of Northumberland, who described him and his following in\r\nthe Internationale as \"the German-Jew Company\" and the \"red\r\nbureaucracy.\" It was therefore not surprising that when the \"red\r\nbureaucracy,\" avowedly founded on the doctrines of Marx, came to be set\r\nup in Russia, it should have been largely led by Jews. This is what the\r\nofficial British White Paper has to say on the matter:\r\n\r\n_Extract from Report from the Netherlands Minister at Petrograd on the\r\n6th of September_, 1918, _forwarded by Sir M. Findlay, at Christiania,\r\nto Mr. Balfour_:\r\n\r\n     I consider that the immediate suppression of Bolshevism is the\r\n     greatest issue now before the world, not even excluding the war\r\n     which is still raging, and unless, as above stated, Bolshevism is\r\n     nipped in the bud immediately, it is bound to spread in one form or\r\n     another over Europe and the whole world, as it is organized and\r\n     worked by Jews who have no nationality, and whose one object is to\r\n     destroy for their own ends the existing order of things.*[839]\r\n\r\nMr. Alston to Lord Curzon, quoting statement from British Consul at\r\nEkaterinburg, January 23, 1919:\r\n\r\n     The Bolsheviks can no longer be described as a political party\r\n     holding extreme communistic views. They form a relatively small\r\n     privileged class which is able to terrorize the rest of the\r\n     population because it has a monopoly both of arms and of food\r\n     supplies. This class consists chiefly of workmen and soldiers, and\r\n     includes a large non-Russian element, such as Letts and Esthonians\r\n     and Jews; the latter are specially numerous in higher posts.\r\n\r\nLord Kilmarnock to Lord Curzon, quoting information given by Frenchman\r\nfrom Petrograd, February 3, 1919:\r\n\r\n     The Bolsheviks comprised chiefly Jews and Germans, who were\r\n     exceedingly active and enterprising. The Russians were largely\r\n     anti-Bolshevik, but were for the most part dreamers, incapable of\r\n     any sustained action, who now, more than ever before, were unable\r\n     to throw off the yoke of their oppressors.*[839]\r\n\r\nMr. Alston to Lord Curzon, forwarding Report from Consul at Ekaterinburg\r\nof February 6, 1919:\r\n\r\n     From examination of several labourer and peasant witnesses, I have\r\n     evidence to the effect that very smallest percentage of this\r\n     district were pro-Bolshevik, majority of labourers sympathizing\r\n     with summoning of Constituent Assembly. Witnesses further stated\r\n     that Bolshevik leaders did not represent Russian working classes,\r\n     most of them being Jews.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. B.S. Lombard to Lord Curzon, March 23, 1919:\r\n\r\n     I have been for ten years in Russia, and have been in Petrograd\r\n     through the whole of the revolution.... [I] had ample opportunity\r\n     of studying Bolshevik methods. It originated in German propaganda,\r\n     and was, and is being, carried out by international Jews. The\r\n     Germans initiated disturbances in order to reduce Russia to chaos.\r\n     They printed masses of paper money to finance their schemes, the\r\n     notes, of which I possess specimens, can be easily recognized by a\r\n     special mark.\r\n\r\nAs one of the results, the writer adds:\r\n\r\n     All business became paralysed, shops were closed, Jews became\r\n     possessors of most of the business houses, and horrible scenes of\r\n     starvation became common in the country districts.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary (where, as has been said, Socialism had been propagated by\r\nJews in the masonic lodges[840]) the outbreak of Bolshevism was\r\nconducted under the auspices of the same race. To quote again an\r\nofficial document on this question, the Report on Revolutionary\r\nActivities issued by a Committee of the New York Legislature, headed by\r\nSenator Lusk[841]:\r\n\r\n     There was no organized opposition to Bela Kun. Like Lenin, he\r\n     surrounded himself with commissars, having absolute authority. Of\r\n     the thirty-two principal commissars, twenty-five were Jews, which\r\n     was about the same proportion as in Russia. The most prominent of\r\n     these formed a directorate of five: Bela Kun, Bela Varga, Joseph\r\n     Pogany, Sigmund Kunfi, and one other. Other leaders were Alpari\r\n     and Samuely, who had charge of the Red Terror, and carried out the\r\n     torturing and executing of the bourgeoisie, especially the groups\r\n     held as hostages, the so-called counter-revolutionists and\r\n     peasants.[842]\r\n\r\nThe same Report publishes a list of seventy-six men prosecuted by the\r\nCommittee on the charge of criminal anarchy in America at the beginning\r\nof 1920, of which the overwhelming majority are seen by their names to\r\nbe Jewish.[843]\r\n\r\nThese names speak for themselves and are published without comment on\r\nthe obvious nationality of the majority of the persons concerned. So far\r\nindeed does the Lusk Committee appear to have been removed from\r\n\"anti-Semitism,\" that nowhere in its vast Report, running to 2008 pages,\r\nis attention drawn to the preponderance of Jews concerned in the\r\nrevolutionary movement, except in the one passage on Hungary quoted\r\nabove. The Lusk Report must therefore be regarded as an absolutely\r\nimpartial statement of facts.\r\n\r\nIn view of these official data, how is it possible for the Jewish press\r\nto pretend that a connexion between Jews and Bolshevism is a malicious\r\ninvention of the \"anti-Semites\"? That all Jews are not Bolsheviks and\r\nthat all Bolsheviks are not Jews is of course obvious; but that Jews are\r\nplaying a preponderating part in Bolshevism it is absurd to deny.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to show that Jews have suffered as much as the\r\nrest of the population in Russia under Bolshevism and that the Jewish\r\nreligion has met with the same hostility as the Christian faith.\r\nDoubtless many Jews have suffered in Russia, since human violence, once\r\nallowed to go unchecked, is liable to express itself in various\r\nunexpected ways, and the resentment of the Russian \"proletariat\" towards\r\nthe Jews was bound to break out under Lenin as under the Tzar. Again, a\r\ncampaign against Christianity inevitably led in Russia, as in France, to\r\na campaign against all forms of religion, and the Jewish Bolsheviks,\r\nbeing atheists themselves, were doubtless as ready as Lambert of the\r\nFrench Revolution to turn against the believers in the faith they had\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nYet that the Jewish religion suffered to the same extent as\r\nChristianity, or that any organized campaign was conducted against it by\r\nthe Government, is effectually disproved by the lamentations of\r\nprofessing Jews on the death of Lenin.[844] Indeed, as is generally\r\nrecognized, the fall of the Soviet Government must mean the downfall of\r\nthe Jews from the position of privilege they now occupy.\r\n\r\nThat in our own country Jews are playing a part in the background of\r\nBolshevism is again evident. The _Patriot_ recently published a series\r\nof articles giving inside information on the organization of the\r\nrevolutionary movement in Great Britain, where it was stated the whole\r\nplot was directed by a group of twelve men. This group in turn was\r\ncontrolled by three of its members. These three men, as the key\r\nrevealed, were all Jews, so also was \"the fiend in human form whose\r\npsychological perversion produced this plot,\"[845] and who was one of a\r\ngroup in America consisting of four Jews and a Jewess which controlled\r\nan outer revolutionary group of eighteen.[846] The Irish Republican\r\nBrotherhood also maintained close relations with a ring of revolutionary\r\nJews in America. Incidentally, it is curious to notice that the language\r\nemployed in some of the correspondence that has passed between members\r\nof an inner group bears a strong resemblance to that of Weishaupt and\r\nhis fellow-Illuminati.\r\n\r\nJewish influence in the less extreme forms of Socialism in this country\r\nis no less apparent. If the Labour Party is solidly pro-German, it is\r\nalso solidly pro-Jewish. Whilst loudly proclaiming pacifism and pressing\r\nfor the reduction of armaments, it has never uttered a word of protest\r\nagainst the employment of British troops to defend Jewish interests\r\nagainst the Arabs in Palestine. The blessed word Mesopotamia may be\r\nfreely mentioned in connexion with the withdrawal of troops from\r\nmilitary adventures, but never the word Palestine. Again, the free\r\nadmission of aliens and particularly of Jews into this country has\r\nalways been one of the principal planks in the Labour platform. Even the\r\nJewish capitalist meets with indulgence at the hands of our Socialist\r\nIntellectuals, who whilst inveighing against British owners of property,\r\nnever include Jewish millionaires in their diatribes.\r\n\r\nThis may perhaps throw some light on the question frequently propounded:\r\nHow can one believe that Jews advocate Socialism since they stand to\r\nlose everything by it? The fact remains that many Jews do advocate it.\r\nAfter the recent accession of the Labour Party to office the _Jewish\r\nWorld_ observed:\r\n\r\n     The result of the General Election in England is regarded as very\r\n     gratifying by the Hebrew and Yiddish press. The Hebrew journals in\r\n     Palestine, as well as the Hebrew and Yiddish organs in Europe and\r\n     America, express satisfaction at the return to Parliament of men\r\n     who have repeatedly assured the public of their intention to adhere\r\n     to the Balfour declaration.[847]\r\n\r\nA further reason is advanced by the _Jewish Courier_ for rejoicing at\r\nthe downfall of the Conservative Government, namely, that \"the election\r\nresults have wiped out anti-Semitic remnants in England,\" for \"the\r\nConservative Government does include several members who are far from\r\nfavourably disposed towards Jews.\"[848] The indulgence shown to the Jews\r\nand the honours piled on them by Conservative statesmen therefore\r\navailed nothing to the Conservative cause, and the welfare of the whole\r\ncountry was subordinated to the interests of the Jews alone.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult at first to understand how the programme of the \"Labour\"\r\nParty, even when combined with ardent pro-Semitism, could however be in\r\naccord with the interests of the Jews, who have never displayed any\r\nhostility towards the Capitalist system which Socialism sets out to\r\ndestroy. Indeed, we find the same Jewish paper which rejoiced at the\r\nadvent of the present Government to office offering birthday\r\ncongratulations to the richest Jew in this country, whose wealth, it\r\ngoes on to observe with some complacency, \"amounts to no less than\r\n£12,000,000 sterling, and is constantly increasing, apart from the\r\ninterest that it brings, by the huge profits of the concerns in which he\r\nis interested.\"[849]\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that in the eyes of Jewry all capitalists are not\r\nto be regarded as monsters who should be mercilessly expropriated.\r\n\r\nBut in considering the war on Capitalism it is essential to bear in mind\r\nthat capitalists are of two kinds: national industrial\r\ncapitalists--largely Gentiles and usually men of brains and energy who\r\nhave built up flourishing businesses--and international loan-mongering\r\ncapitalists, principally, though not exclusively, Jews, who live by\r\nspeculation. Whilst to the former, social unrest may prove fatal, to the\r\nlatter any disturbances may provide opportunities for profit. As M.\r\nGeorges Batault has well expressed it:\r\n\r\n     From the strictly financial point of view, the most disastrous\r\n     events of history, wars or revolutions, never represent\r\n     catastrophes; the manipulators of money and the wary business men\r\n     can make profit out of everything, provided they know beforehand\r\n     and are well-informed.... It is certain that the Jews dispersed\r\n     over all the surface of the earth ... are particularly favourably\r\n     situated in this respect.[850]\r\n\r\nIt is significant to notice that the capitalists most attacked by the\r\nSocialists and Pacifists are not those who make profit out of wars and\r\nrevolutions, but those who contribute to the prosperity of the country\r\nand provide work for millions of people. Here, then, the Jews and the\r\nSocialists seem to find a point of agreement. It is evident, at any\r\nrate, that many rich Jews consider that they have nothing to fear from\r\nthe threatened Capital Levy and other features of expropriation. Are we\r\nnot irresistibly reminded of the passage in the Protocols--where\r\nincidentally the Capital Levy is specifically mentioned--\"Ours they will\r\nnot touch, because the moment of attack will be known to us and we shall\r\ntake measures to protect our own\"?\r\n\r\nBut let us consider further how the Socialist plan for \"the\r\nnationalization of all the means of production, distribution, and\r\nexchange\" might be reconciled even with the interests of Jewish\r\nIndustrial Capitalists. The more we examine this magic formula which is\r\nto transform the world into a Paradise for the workers, the more we\r\nshall see that it approximates to the system of Super Capitalism, of\r\nwhich, as Werner Sombart has shown, the Jews were the principal\r\ninaugurators. Socialists are fond of explaining that \"Capitalism\" began\r\nwith the introduction of steam; in reality, of course, Capitalism, in\r\nthe sense of wealth accumulated in private hands, has always existed\r\nsince the first savage made his store of winter food. What Socialists\r\nreally mean by Capitalism is the modern system of Industrialism, which\r\ntends to concentrate all the means of production and distribution in the\r\nhands of individuals or groups, who, if they happen to be unscrupulous,\r\nare able by systematic sweating of the worker and bleeding of the\r\nconsumer to conduct operations on so large a scale as to crush all\r\ncompetition by the home worker or the small tradesman.\r\n\r\nObviously, however, with the growing demand of the workers for better\r\nconditions of life and the increasing support lent to them by\r\nenlightened public opinion this possibility cannot continue\r\nindefinitely, and unless a violent convulsion takes place the time will\r\ncome when great industrial magnates will have to content themselves with\r\nmoderate profits on their outlay. Thus although at first sight it might\r\nappear that the Super-Capitalist must desire to maintain the existing\r\norder of things, if he is far-seeing he must realize that profiteering\r\nunder present conditions must soon cease.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore conceivable that even the Jewish Industrial Capitalist\r\nmay see in the nationalization of industry a preferable alternative to\r\nthe limitation of profits under private enterprise. The same financial\r\nacumen and skill in management which has enabled him to control rings\r\nand trusts in the past would ensure him a place at the head of\r\nnationalized industries, which in effect would be nothing but gigantic\r\ntrusts nominally under State control but really, like all State\r\nenterprises, in the hands of a few men. Under Socialism the position of\r\nthese trusts would be rendered impregnable. For whilst under the present\r\nsystem any individual or group may set out to break a trust, no such\r\ncompetition would be possible in a State where private enterprise had\r\nbeen made illegal. The men in control of nationalized industries would\r\ntherefore be able to exercise absolute authority both over the worker\r\nand the consumer. Further, if the worker can be persuaded to accept the\r\nultimate scheme of Communism, which is compulsory labour in return for\r\nno monetary remuneration, but merely a daily ration of food and the\r\nother necessaries of life whenever State officials decide that he\r\nrequires them, the directors of Labour, like the overseers in a slave\r\nplantation, will be able, as in Russia, to impose any conditions they\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nThe Jews may well hope to occupy these posts, not only because of their\r\naptitude for organization on so large a scale, but because their\r\ninternational relations would facilitate the sale or barter of goods\r\nbetween countries. The cohesion which exists amongst them would speedily\r\nlead to the monopolization of all the higher posts by members of their\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to dismiss such a possibility as a chimera. This is what\r\nhappened in Russia and is happening in Germany to-day. Here, then, we\r\nmay find perhaps the inner meaning of a remark attributed to a\r\nprominent member of the Labour Party, that under Socialism a certain\r\nwell-known Jewish capitalist might well be worth £10,000 a year. Lenin\r\nexpressed much the same idea when he said that the Russian Soviet\r\nRepublic might require a thousand first-class specialists \"to direct the\r\nwork of the people,\" and that \"these greatest 'stars' must be paid\r\n25,000 roubles each,\" or even four times that sum, supposing it were\r\nnecessary to employ foreign specialists for the purpose.[851]\r\n\r\nBut the Jewish capitalists doubtless see further that in England, as in\r\nRussia, this condition of things would be merely a temporary phase, and\r\nthat the institution of Socialism by dispossessing the present Gentile\r\nowners of wealth and property would pave the way for a Jewish and German\r\nplutocracy. In Russia wealth has not been altogether destroyed; it has\r\nsimply changed hands, and a class of new rich has sprung up which meets\r\nwith no hostility from the professed advocates of equality. Those Jews\r\nwho see in the Christian Intelligentsia the main obstacle to their dream\r\nof world-power, therefore naturally find in the promoters of\r\nclass-warfare their most valuable allies. For the Christian\r\nIntelligentsia is the sole bare to the enslavement of the proletariat;\r\nmost of the movements to redress the wrongs of the workers, from Lord\r\nShaftesbury's onwards, have arisen not amongst the workers themselves,\r\nbut amongst the upper or middle classes[852]; once these were swept away\r\nan iron bureaucracy would have the workers at their mercy. I do not say\r\nthis is the plan, but I do say that such a hypothesis provides a reason\r\nfor the otherwise unaccountable indulgence displayed by Socialists\r\neverywhere towards wealthy Jews and at the same time for the huge funds\r\nthe Socialists appear to have at their disposal.\r\n\r\nIf big financiers are not at their back, I repeat: where does all the\r\nmoney come from? It seems unlikely that it can be derived from the\r\nBritish owners of wealth and property whom the Socialists are openly out\r\nto dispossess; the only body of financiers which can therefore be\r\nsuspected of contributing towards this end is the body known as\r\n\"International Finance,\" which is mainly, though not exclusively,\r\nJewish.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Jews in all the five great powers at work in the\r\nworld--Grand Orient Masonry, Theosophy, Pan-Germanism, International\r\nFinance, and Social Revolution--is not a matter of surmise but of fact.\r\nLet us now examine what part they are playing in the minor subversive\r\nmovements enumerated in an earlier chapter.\r\n\r\nFreud, the inventor of the most dangerous form of Psycho-Analysis, is a\r\nJew. In this connexion the eminent American neuro-psychiatrist before\r\nquoted writes:\r\n\r\n     Not only the Freud theory of psycho-analysis but a considerable\r\n     quantity of pseudo-scientific propaganda of that type has for years\r\n     been emanating from a group of German Jews who live and have their\r\n     headquarters in Vienna. From its inception, psycho-analysis has\r\n     been in Jewish hands. There are not half a dozen physicians in the\r\n     whole world, recognized as authorities in this field, whose names\r\n     are identified with this movement who are not Jews. This may have\r\n     been an accident, but nevertheless it is a fact.[853]\r\n\r\nI have already referred in an earlier chapter to the question of\r\ndegenerate art defined in a circular to the _New York Herald_ as \"the\r\ndeification of ugliness.\"[854] The originators of this cult are here\r\ndescribed as a group of Satan worshippers in Paris, and the dealers by\r\nwhom the movement was propagated as \"Germans,\" but we note amongst the\r\nlenders to the exhibition at which these \"works of art\" were displayed\r\nseveral Jewish names. Of one well-known Jewish artist a critic has\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n     Were these works the product of a man who had imperfect control\r\n     over his material, who, in stumbling towards the light, dwelt\r\n     inevitably upon much darkness, who sought for beauty and found\r\n     ugliness, who looked for purity and found filth--even then one\r\n     might be silent and hope for better things to come. But here,\r\n     apparently, unless my whole reading is ludicrously wrong, he\r\n     delights in deformity and glories in degradation.... He brings to\r\n     the world of art a new gospel, a black gospel, a gospel in which\r\n     everything is to be inverted and distorted. Whatsoever things are\r\n     hideous, whatsoever things are of evil report, whatsoever things\r\n     are sordid: if there be any unhealthiness or any degradation: think\r\n     on these things.\r\n\r\nWhat better résumé could be given of that tendency to perversion\r\ndenounced by the prophet Isaiah in the words: \"Woe unto them that call\r\nevil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for\r\ndarkness\"? An organ of the Jewish press, with that sense of solidarity\r\nwhich always rallies Jews to the defence of their compatriots however\r\nculpable, immediately detects in the critic's expression of opinion the\r\ninsidious work of \"anti-Semitism.\" A more enlightened Jew, Mr. Frank L.\r\nEmanuel, however, having come to the support of the Gentile critic, the\r\nJewish journal is obliged to admit the justice of his contention that\r\n\"it is lamentable to think of the undue proportion of young Jews\" who\r\n\"have joined the Revolutionary or sham 'Modern Art' movement in this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe same influence will be noticed in the cinema world, where, as has\r\nalready been pointed out, history is systematically falsified in the\r\ninterests of class hatred, and everything that can tend, whilst keeping\r\nwithin the present law, to undermine patriotism or morality is pressed\r\nupon the public. And the cinema trade is almost entirely in the hands of\r\nthe Jews.\r\n\r\nIn the drug traffic Jews are playing a prominent part both here and in\r\nAmerica. An eminent New York doctor writes to me as follows:\r\n\r\n     Members of the Federal narcotic squad attached to the Treasury\r\n     Department and having the function of enforcing the provisions of\r\n     the Harrison Act have long been convinced that there is a direct\r\n     relationship between Radicalism and narcotism. From seven to ten\r\n     years ago this was thought to be a manifestation of pan-German\r\n     propaganda. Activity was and still is greater on the part of the\r\n     distributors and pedlars than is to be accounted for by the large\r\n     profits, according to their story. Curiously enough, the traffic\r\n     largely stopped for several weeks following the signing of the\r\n     Armistice.\r\n\r\n     In one instance, seven regularly licensed physicians of the \"East\r\n     Side,\" all Jews, were arrested in succession during the summer of\r\n     1920 for illegitimate use of narcotic prescriptions, and every\r\n     office raided had large quantities of Radical literature. Such\r\n     associations are not uncommon.\r\n\r\n     As to the distribution, a recent investigation by _Hearst's\r\n     Magazine_ definitely revealed the fact that the illegitimate\r\n     distributors were almost invariably of the Jewish race, and that\r\n     the pedlars were exclusively Jewish and Italian.\r\n\r\nEnough, then, has been said to show that, whether as agents or as\r\nprincipals, Jews are playing a part in all subversive movements. A\r\nChristian Jew, no renegade to his race but deeply concerned for their\r\nfuture development, said recently to the present writer: \"The growing\r\nmaterialism amongst Jews has made them the most destructive force in the\r\nworld. The only hope for them is to accept Christianity. At present\r\nthey are the greatest danger that Christian civilization has to face.\"\r\n\r\nThe recognition of all these facts does not of course imply the belief\r\nthat all Jews are destructive. Undoubtedly there are good and loyal\r\nJews--particularly in France, where the Sephardim predominate--who have\r\nabsolutely identified themselves with the country of their adoption, and\r\nare sincerely opposed to Bolshevism. But these isolated individuals\r\ncarry little weight compared to the massed forces of subversive Jewry.\r\nThe same thing was observed in America, where a report privately\r\ncommunicated to the present writer in 1923 stated:\r\n\r\n     It appears not without significance that Radical literature is\r\n     never anti-Semitic, but, on the contrary, manifestoes issued by the\r\n     Executive Committee of the Communist Party are often emphatically\r\n     pro-Jewish. So far as I know, there is not one exclusively Jewish\r\n     organization in the United States which is openly and consistently\r\n     fighting Radicalism. Conservative Judaism loyal to the United\r\n     States and its institutions as conceived by its founders is\r\n     unorganized and inarticulate.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the Jewish press protests at the injustice of\r\nassociating Jews with Bolshevism it may be legitimately answered: What\r\nhas Jewry done collectively to disassociate itself from Bolshevism?[855]\r\nWhat official protests has the Jewish press uttered against any\r\nsubversive movement except when Jewish interests were threatened?[856]\r\nHas it not, on the contrary, denounced all patriotic efforts to oppose\r\nthe forces of destruction whenever such efforts necessitated the\r\nexposure of the corrupt elements in Jewry?\r\n\r\nBut these tactics have not been confined to the Jewish press alone. The\r\ngeneral press of this country, over which the Jews exercise an\r\nincreasing control, has followed the same policy. This process of\r\npenetration began long ago on the Continent. As early as 1846 an English\r\nmissionary to the Jews in Berlin wrote:\r\n\r\n     Independently of the fifteen exclusively Jewish journals of\r\n     Germany, four of which have made their appearance since the\r\n     beginning of the present year, the daily political press of Europe\r\n     is very much under the dominion of the Jews; as literary\r\n     contributors, they influence almost every leading Continental\r\n     newspaper, and as controversy seems to be their native air, and\r\n     they bring into the field mental energies of no ordinary stamp,\r\n     they find no lack of employment, and if any literary opponent\r\n     ventures to endeavour to arrest the progress of Judaism to\r\n     political power, he finds himself held up to public notice, and\r\n     exposed to attack after attack in most of the leading journals of\r\n     Europe. Such ... was the lot of a Roman Catholic priest of Prague,\r\n     who lately wrote a pamphlet entitled _Guter Rath für Zeit der\r\n     Noth_, directed against the advancing power of Judaism. And such is\r\n     my conviction of the extent of the participation the Jews take in\r\n     the everyday literature of Germany, that I never pass by a crowded\r\n     reading-room, but what I think I see standing behind the scenes a\r\n     Jew, causing new ideas to rise and stir, and develop themselves in\r\n     the unsuspecting mind of the Gentile.[857]\r\n\r\nDo we not see the same methods being pursued with still greater vigour\r\nto-day? It would not be an exaggeration to say that there is hardly a\r\nperiodical in this country with the exception of _The Patriot_ that\r\ndares to speak out freely on questions in which the interests of Jews\r\nare involved.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the whole educational as well as the whole political\r\nand social world is permeated with Jewish influence. Every man in public\r\nlife, every modern politician, to whatever party he belongs, seems to\r\nfind it _de rigueur_ to have his confidential Jewish adviser at his\r\nelbow, just as in the Middle Ages a prince had his Jewish doctor always\r\nat hand to mix his potions and ensure him long life. This appears to be\r\nowing not only to the utility of the Jew in financing projects, but to\r\nthe almost universal belief in the superior intelligence of the Jewish\r\nrace which the Jew has succeeded in implanting in the Gentile mind.\r\n\r\nBut the time has come to ask: Is the Jew really the super-man we have\r\nbeen taught to consider him? On examination we shall find that in the\r\npresent as in the past his talents are displayed principally along two\r\nlines--financial and occult. Usurers in the Middle Ages, financiers\r\nto-day, the Jews have always excelled in the making and manipulating of\r\nwealth. And just as at the former period they were the great masters of\r\nmagic, so at the present time they are the masters of the almost\r\nmagical art of gaining control over the mind both of the individual and\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nYet in the realms of literature, philosophy, painting, sculpture,\r\npolitics, and even science, Jews will be found frequently occupying the\r\nsecond or third ranks, and only very seldom the first. Heine may be\r\ncited as a poet of the first order, Spinoza as a philosopher, Disraeli\r\nas a statesman, but it would be difficult to prolong the list. On the\r\nstage and in music alone can the Jews be said to have proved absolutely\r\nthe equals of their Gentile competitors. The fact is that the Jew is not\r\nusually a man of vast conceptions, nor is he endowed with great\r\noriginality of mind; his skill consists rather in elaborating or in\r\nadapting other men's ideas and rendering them more effectual. Thus the\r\nmost important inventions of modern times have not been made by Jews,\r\nbut have been frequently improved by them. Neither James Watt,\r\nStephenson, Marconi, Edison, Pasteur, nor Madame Curie were of the\r\nJewish race, and the same might be said of nearly all the greatest men\r\nwho have lived since the dawn of our civilization. Napoleon was not a\r\nJew, nor was Shakespeare, nor Bacon, nor Sir Isaac Newton, nor Michael\r\nAngelo, nor Leonardo da Vinci, nor Galileo, nor Dante, nor Descartes,\r\nnor Molière, nor Emerson, nor Abraham Lincoln, nor Goethe, nor Kant, nor\r\neven Machiavelli. Thrown on their own resources, what civilization were\r\nthe Jews able to create? Whilst Egypt, Greece, and Rome have left\r\nimmortal monuments, what monuments has Palestine bequeathed to the\r\nworld?[858]\r\n\r\nThe Jews, then, provide a high average of cleverness, but have they ever\r\nduring the last two thousand years produced one mighty genius? Moreover,\r\nagainst this high average of intelligence must be set an equally high\r\naverage of mental derangement. On this point we have the evidence of the\r\n_Jewish Encyclopædia_:\r\n\r\n     The Jews are more subject to diseases of the nervous system than\r\n     the other races and peoples among which they dwell. Hysteria and\r\n     neurasthenia appear to be most frequent. Some physicians of large\r\n     experience among Jews have even gone so far as to state that most\r\n     of them are neurasthenic and hysterical. Tobler claims that all\r\n     the Jewish women in Palestine are hysterical; and Raymond says that\r\n     in Warsaw, Poland, hysteria is very frequently met with among both\r\n     Jewish men and Jewish women. The Jewish population of that city\r\n     alone is almost exclusively the inexhaustible source for the supply\r\n     of hysterical males for the clinics of the whole Continent\r\n     (_L'Etude des Maladies du Système Nerveux en Russie_). As regards\r\n     Austria and Germany, the same neurotic taint of the Jews has been\r\n     emphasized by Krafft, Ebbing, etc.... In New York it has been shown\r\n     by Collins that among 333 cases of neurasthenia which came under\r\n     his observation, more than 40 per cent, were of Jewish extraction,\r\n     etc.[859]\r\n\r\nThe same American neuro-psychiatrist already quoted attributes the\r\npredominance of Jews in the revolutionary movement in America largely to\r\nthis cause:\r\n\r\n     Anarchists have been developed largely from the criminal classes,\r\n     and a belief in anarchy, _per se_, is a psychopathic manifestation.\r\n     A student of anarchy, therefore, would not only be obliged to cover\r\n     the field of criminology, but its more significant and important\r\n     background, psycho-pathology. Some anarchists are actually insane,\r\n     while others show marked psychological deficiencies. Under our laws\r\n     as they are now framed, they cannot be restrained unless they\r\n     commit acts of violence.\r\n\r\n     As it is, our asylums are filled with this class, and that\r\n     introduces another phase of the matter. Our asylum insane are\r\n     largely recruited from the Jewish race, at least recruited in\r\n     tremendous disproportion to their number in the population. The\r\n     fact that the revolutionary movement is so largely made up of\r\n     Jewish elements furnishes an interesting confirmation of what I\r\n     have said.\r\n\r\nThe _Jewish World_, recently commenting on the \"generally admitted\" fact\r\nthat \"the percentage of mental disorders among Jews is much greater than\r\namong non-Jews,\" asks: \"Is the cause inherent, that is to say, is there\r\na racial disposition towards degeneracy, or is it the result of the\r\nexternal conditions and causes?\" The writer goes on to refer to an\r\narticle in the _Zukunft_ which supports the view that the terrible\r\nexperiences of the Jews in the Middle Ages have affected their nervous\r\nsystem, and therefore that the cause of mental derangement amongst them\r\n\"is not due to racial disposition, is not an ethnic principle, but is the\r\nresult of the tragic lot of the Jewish people.\"[860] It might perhaps\r\nbe traced more surely to the habit of brooding on that tragic lot. At\r\nany rate, it is curious to notice that the two symptoms recognized in\r\nthe first stages of \"general paralysis of the insane,\" the mania that\r\none is the object of persecution and \"exalted ideas\" (known in France as\r\nthe _folie des grandeurs_), are the two obsessions that the Talmud and\r\nthe Cabala with their dreams of world-domination under an avenging\r\nMessiah have inculcated in the mind of the Jew.\r\n\r\nBut whatever are the causes of this neurosis, it is surely undesirable\r\nthat a race which exhibits it should be allowed to control the destinies\r\nof the British Empire or indeed of any country. If \"all the Jewish women\r\nin Palestine are hysterical,\" presumably many of their menkind suffer\r\nfrom the same disability, which certainly does not promise well for the\r\nluckless Arab who is to live beneath their sway. How much of the trouble\r\nthat has occurred already in Palestine may be attributed to this cause\r\nit is impossible to know. The increasing number of Jews in positions of\r\nauthority in England presents, however, a far greater subject for alarm.\r\nJews and Arabs are at any rate both Semites and may be expected to have\r\ncertain ideas in common, but to place a highly civilized Aryan race\r\nunder Semitic control is another matter. The time has come for every\r\nBriton to ask himself whether he seriously desires to see the traditions\r\nof his country, those great traditions of honour, integrity, and justice\r\nwhich have made the name of England great, replaced by Oriental\r\nstandards. I do not say that there are no honourable and upright Jews,\r\nbut I do maintain that the spirit of fair play which is the essence of\r\nthe British character is not the characteristic of the Jewish race in\r\ngeneral. The complete absence of this spirit shown in the attempts of\r\nagitators to suppress free speech during elections cannot be attributed\r\nto English working-men--whose \"sporting\" instinct is highly\r\ndeveloped--and testifies to the alien character of the so-called Labour\r\nmovement. If England loses the spirit of fair play, she will have lost\r\nher most priceless national heritage.\r\n\r\nConservatism, which has always stood for these great traditions, allows\r\nitself to be hypnotized by the memory of Disraeli and accepts his dictum\r\nthat \"the natural tendency of the Jews is to Conservatism\"--hence the\r\nadvisability of placing Jews in control of its interests. The late Mr.\r\nHyndman saw further when he warned us that \"those who are accustomed to\r\nlook upon all Jews as essentially practical and conservative, as\r\ncertain, too, to enlist on the side of the prevailing social system,\r\nwill be obliged to reconsider their conclusions.\"[861] The causes of\r\nthe recent _débâcle_ of the Conservative Government are still obscure,\r\nbut the fact remains that it was precisely at a moment when Conservative\r\norganization had passed largely into Jewish hands that Conservatism met\r\nwith the most astounding disaster in the whole of its history. If the\r\nmanner in which Conservative propaganda was conducted at this moment was\r\nan example of Jewish efficiency, it might be well to consider whether on\r\na future occasion the task should not be confided into the hands of\r\nsimple Britons.\r\n\r\n_The only effectual way of combating Socialism is to show up the alien\r\ninfluences behind it_. As long as the working man believes it to be the\r\noutcome of a genuine British labour movement, he will turn a deaf ear to\r\nall warnings and anti-Socialist propaganda will merely serve to drive\r\nmore recruits into the Socialist camp. But let him once suspect that he\r\nis being made the tool of foreign intrigue, and all his national feeling\r\nwill assert itself. We have only to ask him whether he wants his work\r\ntaken from him by the import of alien goods, his housing accommodation\r\nappropriated by alien immigrants, finally to make him understand who are\r\nthe people behind the scenes advocating a policy so disastrous to his\r\ntrue interests, in order to gain his support. The Secret Service has\r\noverwhelming evidence on this last point, which under a Conservative\r\nGovernment might have been made public, but unseen influences in high\r\nplaces have ordained its suppression. The slogan \"Britain for the\r\nBritons,\" that would form the strongest counterblast to the false\r\nslogans of Socialism, has been barred from Conservative platforms and\r\nthe very word \"alien\" avoided lest it should offend Jewish\r\nsusceptibilities. Thus out of deference to the Jews, Conservatism allows\r\nits most powerful weapon to rust in its armoury.\r\n\r\nIn reality these tactics avail nothing to the Conservative cause. The\r\ngreat weight of Jewry will never be thrown into the scale of true\r\nConservatism; only in so far as Conservatism abandons its patriotic\r\ntraditions and compromises with the forces of Internationalism will it\r\nwin any considerable Jewish support. We have but to follow the\r\ncommitments on current politics in the Jewish press in order to realize\r\nthat the only standard by which the Jews judge of any political party is\r\nthe measure in which it will confer exclusive advantages on their own\r\nrace. The Jewish question, therefore, does not turn on whether the Jews\r\nshall be accorded everywhere equal rights with the rest of mankind, but\r\nwhether they shall be placed above the law, whether they shall be\r\nallowed to occupy everywhere a privileged position.[862] Nothing less\r\nwill satisfy them, and any attempt to oppose this claim will always be\r\nmet by them with the cry of \"persecution.\" Further, this position of\r\nprivilege represents to a section of Jewry merely a stage on the road to\r\nworld-domination. For if, as we have seen by documentary evidence, this\r\nplan has always existed in the past, is it likely that it has been\r\nabandoned at the very moment which seems most propitious for its\r\nrealization? The trend of present events and the tone of the Jewish\r\npress certainly do not warrant any such conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, I do not think that the Jews can be proved to provide\r\nthe sole cause of world-unrest. In order to establish this contention we\r\nshould be obliged to show the Jews to have been the authors of every\r\npast social convulsion in the history of modern civilization, to\r\ndiscover their influence behind the heretical sects of Islam, as behind\r\nthe Bavarian Illuminati and the Anarchists of Russia. In the absence of\r\nany such conclusive evidence we must therefore recognize the existence\r\nof other destructive forces at work in the world.\r\n\r\nBut this is not to underrate the importance of the Jewish peril.\r\nAlthough the existence of an inner circle of Masonic \"Elders\" remains\r\nproblematical, Jewry in itself constitutes the most effectual\r\nFreemasonry in the world. What need of initiations, or oaths, or signs,\r\nor passwords amongst people who perfectly understand each other and are\r\neverywhere working for the same end? Far more potent than the sign of\r\ndistress that summons Freemasons to each other's aid at moments of peril\r\nis the call of the blood that rallies the most divergent elements in\r\nJewry to the defence of the Jewish cause.\r\n\r\nThe old complaint of the French merchants already quoted would thus\r\nappear to be justified, that \"the Jews are particles of quicksilver,\r\nwhich at the least slant run together into a block.\" One must therefore\r\nnot be deceived by the fact that they often appear disunited. There may\r\nbe, and indeed is, very little unity amongst Jews, but there is immense\r\nsolidarity. A Jew named Morel, referring to the persecution of the\r\nconverted Rabbi Drach by the Jews, observes:\r\n\r\n     What can the wisest measures of the authorities of all countries do\r\n     against _the vast and permanent conspiracy of a people_ which, like\r\n     a network as vast as it is strong, stretched over the whole globe,\r\n     brings its force to bear wherever an event occurs that interests\r\n     the name of Israelite?[863]\r\n\r\nIt is this solidarity that constitutes the real Jewish Peril and at the\r\nsame time provides the real cause of \"anti-Semitism.\" If in a world\r\nwhere all patriotism, all national traditions, and all Christian virtues\r\nare being systematically destroyed by the doctrines of International\r\nSocialism one race alone, a race that since time immemorial has\r\ncherished the dream of world-power, is not only allowed but encouraged\r\nto consolidate itself, to maintain all its national traditions, and to\r\nfulfil all its national aspirations at the expense of other races, it is\r\nevident that Christian civilization must be eventually obliterated. The\r\nwave of anti-Jewish feeling that during the last few years has been\r\npassing over this country has nothing in common with the racial hatred\r\nthat inspires the \"anti-Semitism\" of Germany; it is simply the answer to\r\na pretension that liberty-loving Britons will not admit. Those of us\r\nwho, sacrificing popularity and monetary gain, dare to speak out on this\r\nquestion have no hatred in our hearts, but only love for our country. We\r\nbelieve that not only our national security but our great national\r\ntraditions are at stake, and that unless England awakens in time she\r\nwill pass under alien domination and her influence as the stronghold of\r\nChristian civilization will be lost to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the course of associations working throughout\r\nnineteen centuries to undermine social and moral order and above all\r\nChristian civilization. We have also seen that although on the one hand\r\nthe unholy spirit of destruction and on the other the natural spirit of\r\nrevolt against oppression have always existed independently of any\r\norganization, it is to secret societies using and organizing these\r\nforces that the revolutionary movement has owed its success. Further, we\r\nhave considered the possibility that behind both open and secret\r\nsubversive societies there may exist a hidden centre of direction, and\r\nfinally we have observed that at the present time many lines of\r\ninvestigation reveal a connexion between these groups and the Grand\r\nOrient, or rather with an invisible circle concealed behind that great\r\nmasonic power. At the same time this circle is clearly not French in\r\ncharacter since everywhere the activities of World Revolution are\r\ndirected against France and England but seldom against Germany and never\r\nagainst the Jews. It would not be an exaggeration to say that no\r\nsubversive movement in the world to-day is either pro-French,\r\npro-British, or \"anti-Semitic.\" We must conclude then that if one Power\r\ncontrols the rest it is either the Pan-German Power, the Jewish Power or\r\nwhat we can only call Illuminism.\r\n\r\nThis last hypothesis is one that deserves serious consideration. In the\r\nlight of our present knowledge it does not appear impossible that if an\r\ninner circle of World Revolution exists it consists of a purely\r\nInternational group of men whose aim is that of Weishaupt--the\r\ndestruction of the present system of society. That such an aim can be\r\nseriously entertained is shown by the fact that it is openly proclaimed\r\nby a whole school of writers and thinkers ranging from gentle Idealists\r\nto ferocious Anarchists who, whilst widely differing as to methods and\r\nthe ultimate ends to be attained, are agreed on the common purpose\r\nexpressed by Rabaud de Saint-Étienne in the words: \"Everything, yes,\r\neverything must be destroyed, since everything must be re-made.\"\r\n\r\nIt is idle to say that so insane a project can present no danger to the\r\nworld; the fact remains that an increasing number of people regard it\r\nwith perfect equanimity. The phrase: \"All civilizations have passed\r\naway; ours will doubtless pass away likewise,\" is continually to be\r\nheard on the lips of apparently sane men and women who, whether they\r\nadvocate such an eventuality or not, seem prepared to accept it in a\r\nspirit of complete fatalism and to put up no resistance. The point they\r\nignore is that when civilization existed only in isolated spots on the\r\nearth's surface it might pass away in one spot only to spring to life in\r\nanother, but now that civilization is world-wide the dream of a return to\r\nnature and the joys of savagery conjured up by Rousseau and Weishaupt\r\ncan never be realized. Yet if civilization in a material sense cannot be\r\ndestroyed, it is none the less possible to take the soul out of it, to\r\nreduce it to a dead and heartless machine without human feelings or\r\ndivine aspirations. The Bolsheviks continue to exist amidst telephones,\r\nelectric light, and other amenities of modern life, but they have almost\r\nkilled the soul of Russia. In this sense then civilization may pass\r\naway, not as the civilizations of the ancient world passed away, leaving\r\nonly desert sands and crumbling ruins behind them, but vanishing\r\nimperceptibly from beneath the outward structure of our existing\r\ninstitutions. Here is the final goal of world revolution.\r\n\r\nIf, then, one inner circle exists, composed of Illuminati animated by a\r\npurely destructive purpose it is conceivable that they might find\r\nsupport in those Germans who desire to disintegrate the countries of the\r\nAllies with a view to future conquests, and in those Jews who hope to\r\nestablish their empire on the ruins of Christian civilization--hence the\r\nsuperb organization and the immense financial resources at the disposal\r\nof the world revolutionaries. On the other hand it may be that the\r\nhidden centre of direction consists in a circle of Jews located in the\r\nbackground of the Grand Orient, or perhaps, like the early\r\nnineteenth-century Illuminati, located nowhere but working in accord and\r\nusing both Pan-Germans and Gentile Illuminati as their tools.\r\n\r\nOn this point I think it would be dangerous at present to dogmatize. But\r\nthat the problem is capable of elucidation I have no doubt whatever. If\r\nthe Secret Services of the world had chosen to co-ordinate and make\r\npublic the facts in their possession the whole plot might long since\r\nhave been laid bare. A \"Department for the Investigation of Subversive\r\nMovements\" should have had a place in every ordered government. This\r\nmight have been created by the recent Conservative Government in\r\nEngland, but the same mysterious influence that protected the enemy\r\nduring the Great War has throughout prevented disclosures that would\r\nhave enlightened the country on the real nature of the peril confronting\r\nit. In the present state of European politics the only course open to\r\nthose who would save civilization is to act independently of\r\ngovernments, and form a counter-organization in each country with\r\nunofficial bureaux of information maintaining relations with each other,\r\nyet each retaining its national character.\r\n\r\nAs far as this country is concerned I am convinced that only a great\r\nnational movement can save us from destruction--a movement in which men\r\nof all classes and above all of the working-class will take part.\r\nFascismo triumphed in Italy, because it was not, as it has been absurdly\r\nrepresented, a reactionary movement, but because it was essentially\r\ndemocratic and progressive, because by appealing to the noblest\r\ninstincts in human nature, to patriotism and self-sacrifice, it rallied\r\nall elements in a disorganized and disunited nation around the standard\r\nof a common cause.\r\n\r\nOne cannot bring about any great movement without first kindling a\r\nsacred fire in the hearts of men; one cannot move masses of people\r\nmerely by appealing to self-interest; they must have a cause to fight\r\nfor, a cause that is not entirely their own. Socialism, whilst enlisting\r\na large proportion of its following by appealing to their baser\r\ninstincts, has nevertheless, by its false ideals and promises, been able\r\nto kindle a fire in many generous hearts, and to persuade deluded\r\nenthusiasts that they are working for the welfare of humanity. The only\r\nway to combat Socialism is to create counter enthusiasm for a true\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nYet even Mussolini found that a purely secular ideal was not enough, and\r\nthat the spirit of religious fervour was necessary to defeat the spirit\r\nof materialism and destruction. For behind the concrete forces of\r\nrevolution--whether Pan-German, Judaic, or Illuminist--beyond that\r\ninvisible secret circle which perhaps directs them all, is there not yet\r\nanother force, still more potent, that must be taken into account? In\r\nlooking back over the centuries at the dark episodes that have marked\r\nthe history of the human race from its earliest origins--strange and\r\nhorrible cults, waves of witchcraft, blasphemies, and desecrations--how\r\nis it possible to ignore the existence of an Occult Power at work in the\r\nworld? Individuals, sects, or races fired with the desire of\r\nworld-domination, have provided the fighting forces of destruction, but\r\nbehind them are the veritable powers of darkness in eternal conflict\r\nwith the powers of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nJEWISH EVIDENCE ON THE TALMUD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe denunciation of the Talmud by the Jew Pfefferkorn in 1509 and the\r\nex-Rabbi Drach in 1844 have been quoted in the course of this book.\r\nGraetz however, in his _History of the Jews_, quotes an earlier incident\r\nof this kind.[864] In the thirteenth century a converted Jew and former\r\nTalmudist Donin who, on his baptism, assumed the name of Nicholas,\r\npresented himself before the Pope, Gregory IX, \"and brought charges\r\nagainst the Talmud, saying that it distorted the words of Holy Writ, and\r\nin the Agadic portions of it there were to be found disgraceful\r\nrepresentations of God,\" that it contained many gross errors and\r\nabsurdities, further that \"it was filled with abuse against the founder\r\nof the Christian religion and the Virgin. Donin demonstrated that it was\r\nthe Talmud which prevented the Jews from accepting Christianity, and\r\nthat without it they would certainly have abandoned their state of\r\nunbelief.\" Again \"he stated that the Talmudical writings taught it was a\r\nmeritorious action to kill the best man among the Christians[865] ...\r\nthat it was lawful to deceive a Christian without any scruple; that it\r\nwas permitted to Jews to break a promise made on oath.\" These Graetz\r\ndescribes as lying charges.\r\n\r\nThe Jews were accordingly ordered by the Pope to hand over all their\r\ncopies of the Talmud to the Dominicans and Franciscans for examination,\r\nand if their judgment should corroborate the charges of Nicholas Donin,\r\nthey were to burn the volumes of the Talmud (June 9, 1239).\r\n\r\nIn France Graetz goes on to relate that \"the priest-ridden and\r\nweak-minded Louis IX\"--that is to say, Saint Louis--pursued the same\r\ncourse. \"The Talmud was put on its trial. Four distinguished Rabbis of\r\nNorth France were commanded by the King to hold a public disputation\r\nwith Nicholas, either to refute the imputations levelled against the\r\nTalmud, or to make confession of the abuse against Christianity and the\r\nblasphemies against God that it contained.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to imagine a fairer decision, and the queen-mother,\r\nBlanche de Castille, was careful to assure the first witness summoned\r\nthat if the lives of the Rabbis were in danger she would protect them\r\nand that he was only required to answer the questions that would be\r\nasked of him. Now, there would have been nothing simpler than for the\r\nRabbis to admit honestly that these offensive passages existed, that\r\nthey had been written perhaps in moments of passion in a less\r\nenlightened age, that they recognized the indelicacy of insulting the\r\nreligion of the country in which they lived, and that therefore such\r\npassages should henceforth be deleted. But instead of adopting this\r\nstraightforward course, which might have put an end for ever to attacks\r\non the book they held sacred, the Rabbis proceeded to deny the existence\r\nof the \"alleged blasphemous and immoral expressions\" and to declare that\r\n\"the odious facts related in the Talmud concerning a Jesus, the son of\r\nPantheras, had no reference to Jesus of Nazareth, but to one of a\r\nsimilar name who had lived long before him.\" Graetz, who admits that\r\nthis was an error and that the passages in question did relate to the\r\nJesus of the Christians, represents the Rabbis as being merely \"misled\"\r\non the question. But the King, who was not misled by the Rabbis, ordered\r\nall copies of the Talmud to be burnt, and in June 1242 these were\r\ncommitted to the flames.[866]\r\n\r\nThe Talmud, however, continued to exist, and it was not until 1640 that,\r\nas we have already seen, the offending passages against Christ were\r\nexpunged by the Rabbis as a measure of expediency. Now that they have\r\nbeen replaced, no further attempt is made to deny that they refer to the\r\nfounder of Christianity. As far as I am aware they are not included in\r\nany English translation of the Talmud, but may be found in an English\r\nversion of Dr. Gustav H. Dalman's book, _Jesus Christus im Talmud_\r\n(1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE \"PROTOCOLS\" OF THE ELDERS OF ZION\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary to the assertions of certain writers, I have never affirmed my\r\nbelief in the authenticity of the Protocols, but have always treated it\r\nas an entirely open question.[867] The only opinion to which I have\r\ncommitted myself is that, whether genuine or not, the Protocols do\r\nrepresent the programme of world revolution, and that in view of their\r\nprophetic nature and of their extraordinary resemblance to the protocols\r\nof certain secret societies in the past, they were either the work of\r\nsome such society or of someone profoundly versed in the lore of secret\r\nsocieties who was able to reproduce their ideas and phraseology.\r\n\r\nThe so-called refutation of the Protocols which appeared in the _Times_\r\nof August 1922, tends to confirm this opinion. According to these\r\narticles the Protocols were largely copied from the book of Maurice\r\nJoly, _Dialogues aux Enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu_, published\r\nin 1864. Let it be said at once that the resemblance between the two\r\nworks could not be accidental, not only are whole paragraphs almost\r\nidentical, but the various points in the programme follow each other in\r\nprecisely the same order. But whether Nilus copied from Joly or _from\r\nthe same source whence Joly derived his ideas_ is another question. It\r\nwill be noticed that Joly in his preface never claimed to have\r\noriginated the scheme described in his book; on the contrary he\r\ndistinctly states that it \"personifies in particular a political system\r\nwhich has not varied for a single day in its application since the\r\ndisastrous and alas! too far-off date of its enthronement.\" Could this\r\nrefer only to the government of Napoleon III, established twelve years\r\nearlier? Or might it not be taken to signify a Machiavellian system of\r\ngovernment of which Napoleon III was suspected by Joly at this moment of\r\nbeing the exponent? We have already seen that this system is said by M.\r\nde Mazères, in his book _De Machiavel et de l'influence de sa doctrine\r\nsur les opinions, les moeurs et la politique de la France pendant la\r\nRévolution_, published in 1816, to have been inaugurated by the French\r\nRevolution, and to have been carried on by Napoleon I against whom he\r\nbrings precisely the same accusations of Machiavellism that Joly brings\r\nagainst Napoleon III. \"The author of _The Prince_,\" he writes, \"was\r\nalways his guide,\" and he goes on to describe the \"parrot cries placed\r\nin the mouths of the people,\" the \"hired writers, salaried newspapers,\r\nmercenary poets and corrupt ministers employed to mislead our vanity\r\nmethodically\"--all this being carried on by \"the scholars of Machiavelli\r\nunder the orders of his cleverest disciple.\" We have already traced the\r\ncourse of these methods from the Illuminati onwards.\r\n\r\nNow precisely at the moment when Joly published his _Dialogues aux\r\nEnfers_ the secret societies were particularly active, and since by this\r\ndate a number of Jews had penetrated into their ranks a whole crop of\r\nliterary efforts directed against Jews and secret societies marked the\r\ndecade. Eckert with his work on Freemasonry in 1852 had given the\r\nincentive; Crétineau Joly followed in 1859 with _L'Eglise Romaine en\r\nface de la Révolution_, reproducing the documents of the Haute Vente\r\nRomaine; in 1868 came the book of the German anti-Semite Goedsche, and\r\nin the following year on a higher plane the work of Gougenot Des\r\nMousseaux, _Le Juif, le Judaïsme, et la Judaïsation des Peuples\r\nChrétiens_. Meanwhile in 1860 the _Alliance Israëlite Universelle_ had\r\narisen, having for its ultimate object \"the great work of humanity, the\r\nannihilation of error and fanaticism, the union of human society in a\r\nfaithful and solid fraternity\"--a formula singularly reminiscent of\r\nGrand Orient philosophy; in 1864 Karl Marx obtained control of the\r\ntwo-year-old \"International Working Men's Association,\" by which a\r\nnumber of secret societies became absorbed, and in the same year Bakunin\r\nfounded his _Alliance Sociale Démocratique_ on the exact lines of\r\nWeishaupt's Illuminism, and in 1869 wrote his _Polémique contre les\r\nJuifs_ (or _Etude sur les Juifs allemands_) mainly directed against the\r\nJews of the _Internationale_. The sixties of the last century therefore\r\nmark an important era in the history of the secret societies, and it was\r\nright in the middle of this period that Maurice Joly published his book.\r\n\r\nNow it will be remembered that amongst the sets of parallels to the\r\nProtocols quoted by me in _World Revolution_, two were taken from the\r\nsources above quoted--the documents of the Haute Vente Romaine and the\r\nprogramme of Bakunin's secret society, the _Alliance Sociale\r\nDémocratique_. Meanwhile Mr. Lucien Wolf had found another parallel to\r\nthe Protocols in Goedsche's book. \"The Protocols,\" Mr. Wolf had no\r\nhesitation in asserting, \"are, in short, an amplified imitation of\r\nGoedsche's handiwork\"[868] and he went on to show that \"Nilus followed\r\nthis pamphlet very closely.\" The Protocols were then declared by Mr.\r\nWolf and his friends to have been completely and finally refuted.\r\n\r\nBut alas for Mr. Wolfe's discernment! The _Times_ articles came and\r\nabolished the whole of his carefully constructed theory. They did not,\r\nhowever, demolish mine; on the contrary, they supplied another and a\r\nvery curious link in the chain of evidence. For is it not remarkable\r\nthat one of the sets of parallels quoted by me appeared in the same year\r\nas Joly's book, and that within the space of nine years no less than\r\nfour parallels to the Protocols should have been discovered? Let us\r\nrecapitulate the events of this decade in the form of a table and the\r\nproximity of dates will then be more apparent:\r\n\r\n    1859. Crétineau Joly's book published containing documents of\r\n          Haute Vente Romaine (parallels quoted by me).\r\n\r\n    1860. _Alliance Israëlite Universelle_ founded.\r\n\r\n    1864. _1st Internationale_ taken over by Karl Marx.\r\n\r\n      \"   _Alliance Sociale Démocratique_ of Bakunin founded\r\n          (parallels quoted by me).\r\n      \"   Maurice Joly's _Dialogue aux Enfers_ published\r\n         (parallels quoted by _Times_).\r\n\r\n    1866. 1st Congress of Internationale at Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1868. Goedsche's _Biarritz_ (parallels quoted by Mr. Lucien\r\n          Wolf).\r\n\r\n    1869. Gougenot Des Mousseaux's _Le Juif_, etc.\r\n\r\n      \"   Bakunin's _Polémique contre les Juifs_.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that at the moment when Maurice Joly wrote his\r\n_Dialogues_, the ideas they embodied were current in many different\r\ncircles. It is interesting, moreover, to notice that the authors of the\r\nlast two works referred to above, the Catholic and Royalist Des\r\nMousseaux and the Anarchist Bakunin, between whom it is impossible to\r\nimagine any connexion, both in the same year denounced the growing power\r\nof the Jews whom Bakunin described as \"the most formidable sect\" in\r\nEurope, and again asserted that a leakage of information had taken place\r\nin the secret societies. Thus in 1870 Bakunin explains that his secret\r\nsociety has been broken up because its secrets have been given\r\naway,[869] and that his colleague Netchaïeff has arrived at the\r\nconclusion that \"in order to found a serious and indestructible society\r\none must take for a basis the policy of Machiavelli.\"[870] Meanwhile\r\nGougenot Des Mousseaux had related in _Le Juif_, that in December 1865\r\nhe had received a letter from a German statesman saying:\r\n\r\n     Since the revolutionary recrudescence of 1848, I have had relations\r\n     with a Jew who, from vanity, betrayed the secret of the secret\r\n     societies with which he had been associated, and who warned me\r\n     eight or ten days beforehand of all the revolutions which were\r\n     about to break out at any point of Europe. I owe to him the\r\n     unshakeable conviction that all these movements of \"oppressed\r\n     peoples,\" etc., etc., are devised by half a dozen individuals, who\r\n     give their orders to the secret societies of all Europe. The ground\r\n     is absolutely mined beneath our feet, and the Jews provide a large\r\n     contingent of these miners....[871]\r\n\r\nThese words were written in the year after the _Dialogues aux Enfers_\r\nwere published.\r\n\r\nIt is further important to notice that Joly's work is dated from Geneva,\r\nthe meeting-place for all the revolutionaries of Europe, including\r\nBakunin, who was there in the same year, and where the first Congress of\r\nthe _Internationale_ led by Karl Marx was held two years later. Already\r\nthe revolutionary camp was divided into warring factions, and the\r\nrivalry between Marx and Mazzini had been superseded by the struggle\r\nbetween Marx and Bakunin. And all these men were members of secret\r\nsocieties. It is by no means improbable then that Joly, himself a\r\nrevolutionary, should during his stay in Geneva have come into touch\r\nwith the members of some secret organization, who may have betrayed to\r\nhim their own secret or those of a rival organization they had reason\r\nto suspect of working under the cover of revolutionary doctrines for an\r\nulterior end. Thus the protocols of a secret society modelled on the\r\nlines of the Illuminati or the Haute Vente Romaine may have passed into\r\nhis hands and been utilized by him as an attack on Napoleon who, owing\r\nto his known connexion with the Carbonari, might have appeared to Joly\r\nas the chief exponent of the Machiavellian art of duping the people and\r\nusing them as the lever to power which the secret societies had reduced\r\nto a system.\r\n\r\nThis would explain Maurice Joly's mysterious reference to the \"political\r\nsystem which has not varied for a single day in its application since\r\nthe disastrous and alas! too far-off date of its enthronement.\"\r\nMoreover, it would explain the resemblance between all the parallels to\r\nthe Protocols from the writings of the Illuminati and Mirabeau's _Projet\r\nde Révolution_ of 1789 onwards. For if the system had never varied, the\r\ncode on which it was founded must have remained substantially the same.\r\nFurther, if it had never varied up to the time when Joly wrote, why\r\nshould it have varied since that date? The rules of lawn tennis drawn up\r\nin 1880 would probably bear a strong resemblance to those of 1920, and\r\nwould also probably follow each other in the same sequence. The\r\ndifferences would occur where modern improvements had been added.\r\n\r\nMight not the same process of evolution have taken place between the\r\ndates at which the works of Joly and Nilus were published? I do not\r\nagree with the opinion of the _Morning Post_ that \"the author of the\r\nProtocols must have had the _Dialogues_ of Joly before him.\" It is\r\npossible, but not proven. Indeed, I find it difficult to imagine that\r\nanyone embarking on such an elaborate imposture should not have\r\npossessed the wit to avoid quoting passages verbatim--without even\r\ntroubling to arrange them in a different sequence--from a book which\r\nmight at any moment be produced as evidence against him. For contrary to\r\nthe assertions of the _Times_ the _Dialogues_ of Joly is by no means a\r\nrare book, not only was it to be found at the British Museum but at the\r\nLondon Library and recently I was able to buy a copy for the modest sum\r\nof 15 francs. There was therefore every possibility of Nilus being\r\nsuddenly confronted with the source of his plagiarism. Further, is it\r\nconceivable that a plagiarist so unskilful and so unimaginative would\r\nhave been capable of improving on the original? For the Protocols are a\r\nvast improvement on the _Dialogues_ of Joly. The most striking passages\r\nthey contain are not to be found in the earlier work, nor, which is more\r\nremarkable, are several of the amazing prophecies concerning the future\r\nwhich time has realized. It is this latter fact which presents the most\r\ninsuperable obstacle to the _Times_ solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nTo sum up then, the Protocols are either a mere plagiarism of Maurice\r\nJoly's work, in which case the prophetic passages added by Nilus or\r\nanother remain unexplained, or they are a revised edition of the plan\r\ncommunicated to Joly in 1864, brought up to date and supplemented so as\r\nto suit modern conditions by the continuers of the plot.\r\n\r\nWhether in this case the authors of the Protocols were Jews or whether\r\nthe Jewish portions have been interpolated by the people into whose\r\nhands they fell is another question. Here we must admit the absence of\r\nany direct evidence. An International circle of world revolutionaries\r\nworking on the lines of the Illuminati, of which the existence has\r\nalready been indicated, offers a perfectly possible alternative to the\r\n\"Learned Elders of Zion.\" It would be easier, however to absolve the\r\nJews from all suspicion of complicity if they and their friends had\r\nadopted a more straightforward course from the time the Protocols\r\nappeared. When some years ago a work of the same kind was directed\r\nagainst the Jesuits, containing what purported to be a \"Secret Plan\" of\r\nrevolution closely resembling the Protocols,[872] the Jesuits indulged\r\nin no invectives, made no appeal that the book should be burnt by the\r\ncommon hangman, resorted to no fantastic explanations, but quietly\r\npronounced the charge to be a fabrication. Thus the matter ended.\r\n\r\nBut from the moment the Protocols were published the Jews and their\r\nfriends had recourse to every tortuous method of defence, brought\r\npressure to bear on the publishers--succeeded, in fact, in temporarily\r\nstopping the sales--appealed to the Home Secretary to order their\r\nsuppression, concocted one clinching refutation after another, all\r\nmutually exclusive of each other, so that by the time the solution now\r\npronounced to be the correct one appeared, we had already been assured\r\nhalf a dozen times that the Protocols had been completely and finally\r\nrefuted. And when at last a really plausible explanation had been\r\ndiscovered, why was it not presented in a convincing manner? All that\r\nwas necessary was to state that the origin of the Protocols had been\r\nfound in the work of Maurice Joly, giving parallels in support of this\r\nassertion. What need to envelop a good case in a web of obvious romance?\r\nWhy all this parade of confidential sources of information, the pretence\r\nthat Joly's book was so rare as to be almost unfindable when a search in\r\nthe libraries would have proved the contrary? Why these allusions to\r\nConstantinople as the place \"to find the key to dark secrets,\" to the\r\nmysterious Mr. X. who does not wish his real name to be known, and to\r\nthe anonymous ex-officer of the Okhrana from whom by mere chance he\r\nbought the very copy of the _Dialogues_ used for the fabrication of the\r\nProtocols by the Okhrana itself, although this fact was unknown to the\r\nofficer in question? Why, further, should Mr. X., if he were a Russian\r\nlandowner, Orthodox by religion and a Constitutional Monarchist, be so\r\nanxious to discredit his fellow Monarchists by making the outrageous\r\nassertion that \"the only occult Masonic organization such as the\r\nProtocols speak of\"--that is to say, a Machiavellian system of an\r\nabominable kind--which he had been able to discover in Southern Russia\r\n\"was a Monarchist one\"?\r\n\r\nIt is evident then that the complete story of the Protocols has not yet\r\nbeen told, and that much yet remains to be discovered concerning this\r\nmysterious affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdullah ibn Maymūn, 37, 197\r\n\r\nAbraham, Book of, 8\r\n\r\n\"Abraham the Jew,\" 85\r\n\r\n\"Absolutes,\" the, 265\r\n\r\nAdam, Book of (see _Codex Nasaræus_)\r\n\r\nAdamites, the, 31\r\n\r\nAdditional Degrees, the 132-148\r\n\r\nAkhnaton (see Ikh-naton)\r\n\r\nAlbigenses, the, 74-76\r\n\r\nAlemanus (or Datylus), 85\r\n\r\n_Aliance Sociale Démocratique_, 268, 295\r\n\r\nAlsace, Jews of, 247\r\n\r\nAlta Vendita (or Haute Vente Romaine), 266\r\n\r\nAltotas, 174, 200\r\n\r\nAmaury, King of Jerusalem, 50\r\n\r\nAmèlie, Queen of Portugal, 283\r\n\r\n_Amis Réunis_ (Loge des), 165, 170, 236\r\n\r\nAmpthill, Lord, 287\r\n\r\nAnabaptists, 180\r\n\r\nAncient Masonry, 304\r\n\r\nAnderson's Constitutions, 129, 148\r\n\r\nAnna of Courland, 165\r\n\r\nAnthroposophical Society, 316\r\n\r\nAntin, Duc d', 137 note, 145, 148, 155, 162\r\n\r\nAntitacts, 31\r\n\r\nArchitecture, Gothic, 111\r\n\r\nAristobulos, 28\r\n\r\nAthanasius, Kircher, 86\r\n\r\nAshkenazim, 247\r\n\r\nAshmole, Elias, 102, 122\r\n\r\nAsiatic Brethren, 169\r\n\r\nAssassins, the 44-48, 113\r\n\r\n\r\nBa'al Shems, 181, _et seq_.\r\n\r\nBabeuf, 252\r\n\r\nBacon, Francis, 97, 119\r\n\r\nBacon, Roger, 143\r\n\r\nBakunin, Michel, 268, 384\r\n\r\nBaldwin II, 49\r\n\r\nBalsamo, Joseph (see Cagliostro)\r\n\r\nBaphomet, 64, 72\r\n\r\nBarbusse, H., 321\r\n\r\nBaron, André, 188\r\n\r\nBarruel, Abbé, vi, ix, 121, 147, 254, 382\r\n\r\nBarthou, Monsieur, 203, 204\r\n\r\nBavaria, Duke of, 86\r\n\r\nBela Kun, 386\r\n\r\nBelgium, Freemasonry in, 282\r\n\r\nBelle-Isle, Maréchal de, 173\r\n\r\nBérage, Chevalier de, 139\r\n\r\nBerckheim, François Charles de, 258, _et seq._\r\n\r\nBesant, Mrs. Annie, 297, _et seq._\r\n\r\nBielfeld, Baron de, 152\r\n\r\nBismarck, Prince von, 356, 357, 366\r\n\r\nBlanc, Louis, 268\r\n\r\nBlavatsky, Madame, 298, _et seq._\r\n\r\nBode, Christian, 211, 233-234, 236, 255\r\n\r\nBogomils, 63, _et seq._\r\n\r\nBolshevism, 357, _et seq._, 384, _et seq._\r\n\r\nBordeaux Jews of, 246, 247\r\n\r\nBourbon, Duc de, 136, 137\r\n\r\nBourbon, Duchesse de, 295\r\n\r\nBrinvilliers, Marquise de, 93\r\n\r\nBruce, Robert, 111, 112, 142\r\n\r\nBrunswick, Duke of, 154, 191, 252, _et seq._, 350\r\n\r\nBullock, 314\r\n\r\nBuonarotti, 252\r\n\r\nBussell, Dr. F.

The word anti-Semite literally signifies a\r\nperson who adopts a hostile attitude towards all the descendants of\r\nShem--the Arabs, and the entire twelve tribes of Israel. To apply the\r\nterm to a person who is merely antagonistic to that fraction of the\r\nSemitic race known as the Jews is therefore absurd, and leads to the\r\nridiculous situation that one may be described as \"anti-Semitic and\r\npro-Arabian.\" This expression actually occurred in _The New Palestine_\r\n(New York), March 23, 1923.

Klein) observes: \"It is not generally known\r\nthat one of the reasons why the Mohammedans removed their Kiblah from\r\nJerusalem to Mecca was that they quarrelled with the Jews over Jesus\r\nChrist, and the proof of this may still be seen in the Golden Gate\r\nleading into the sacred area of the Temple, which was bricked up by the\r\nMohammedans, and is bricked up to this day, because they declared that\r\nnobody should enter through that portal until Jesus Christ comes to\r\njudge the world, and this is stated in the Koran.\" I cannot trace this\r\npassage in the Koran, but much the same idea is conveyed by the Rev.\r\nJ.M. Rodwell, who in the note above quoted adds: \"The Muhammadans\r\nbelieve that Jesus on His return to earth at the end of the world will\r\nslay the Antichrist, die, and be raised again.

The\r\nPharisees, who flattered themselves so highly on possessing it, only had\r\nits outward forms (_apparences_), as Jesus reproaches them at every\r\nmoment.

Von Hammer, however, gives it as the\r\nprogramme of the Dar ul Hikmat, and this seems more probable since the\r\ninitiation consists of nine degrees and Abdullah's society of Batinis,\r\ninto which Karmath had been initiated, included only seven. Yarker (_The\r\nArcane Schools_, p. 185) says the two additional degrees were added by\r\nthe Dar ul Hikmat. It would appear then that de Sacy, in placing this\r\naccount before his description of the Karmathites, was anticipating. The\r\npoint is immaterial, the fact being that the same system was common to\r\nall these ramifications of Ismailis, and that of the Dar ul Hikmat\r\nvaried but little from that of Abdullah and Karmath.\r\n\r\n[131] Von Hammer, op. cit.

It was again\r\nprinted in 1742 by Bro. De la Tierce in his _Histoire, Obligations et\r\nStatuts, etc.,..._ and De la Tierce says that it was 'prononcé par le\r\nGrand Maître des Francs-Maçons de France' in the year 1740.... A. G.\r\nJouast (_Histoire du G.O._, 1865) says the Oration was delivered at the\r\nInstallation of the Duc d'Antin as G.M. on 24th June, 1738, and the same\r\nauthority states that it was first printed at the Hague in 1738, bound\r\nup with some poems attributed to Voltaire, and some licentious tales by\r\nPiron.... Bro. Gould remarks: 'If such a work really existed at that\r\ndate, it was probably the original of the \"_Lettre philosophique par M.\r\nde V---- _, _avec plusieurs piéces galantes_,\" London, 1757.'\" Mr. Gould\r\nhas, however, provided very good evidence that Ramsay was the author of\r\nthe oration by Daruty's discovery of the letter to Cardinal Fleury,\r\nwhich together with the oration itself (translated from De la Tierce's\r\nversion) he reproduces in his _History of Freemasonry_, Vol. III. p. 84.\r\n\r\n[367] _A.Q.C., XXII_.

In England and in the Grand Orient of France most of the\r\nupper degrees have fallen into disuse, and this rite, known in England\r\nas the Ancient and Accepted Rite and in France as the Scottish Rite,\r\nconsists of five degrees only in addition to the three Craft degrees\r\n(known as Blue Masonry), which form the basis of all masonic rites.\r\nThese five degrees are the eighteenth Rose-Croix, the thirtieth Kniqht\r\nKadosch, and the thirty-first to the thirty-third. The English\r\nFreemason, on being admitted to the upper degrees, therefore advances at\r\none bound from the third degree of Master Mason to the eighteenth degree\r\nof Rose-Croix, which thus forms the first of the upper degrees. The\r\nintermediate degrees are, however, still worked in America.\r\n\r\n[416] _Scottish Rite of Freemasonry: the Constitutions and Regulations\r\nof_ 1762, by Albert Pike, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Thirty-third Degree for the Southern Jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States, p. 138 (A.M. 5632).\r\n\r\n[417] RO.

Mr. Gould naïvely adds in a footnote to\r\nthis passage: \"The proposed Dictionary is a curious crux--- is it\r\npossible that the Royal Society may have formed some such idea?\" The\r\nbeginning already made in London was of course the _Cyclopædia_ of\r\nChambers, published in 1728, and Chambers, who in the following year was\r\nmade a Fellow of the Royal Society, if not himself a Mason numbered many\r\nprominent Masons amongst his friends, including the globe-maker Senex to\r\nwhom he had been apprenticed and who published Anderson's\r\n_Constitutions_ in 1723.

The\r\nfollowing pages are taken entirely from these sources.\r\n\r\n[483] Falk does not appear to have brought good fortune to the Goldsmid\r\nfamily, for Margoliouth in a passage which evidently relates to Falk\r\nsays that, according to Jewish legend, the suicide of Abraham Goldsmid\r\nand his brother was attributed to the following cause: \"A Ba'al Shem, an\r\noperative Cabalist, in other words a thaumaturgos and prophet, used to\r\nlive with the father of the Goldsmids. On his death-bed he summoned the\r\npatriarch Goldsmid, and delivered into his hands a box, which he\r\nstrictly enjoined should not be opened till a tertain period which the\r\nBa'al Shem specified, and in case of disobedience a torrent of fearful\r\ncalamities would overwhelm the Goldsmids. The patriarch's curiosity was\r\nnot aroused for some time; but in a few years after the Ba'al Shem's\r\ndeath, Goldsmid, the aged, half sceptic, half curious, forced open the\r\nfatal box, and then the Goldsmids began to learn what it was to\r\ndisbelieve the words of a Ba'al Shem.\"--Margoliouth, _History of the\r\nJews_, II. 144.\r\n\r\n[484] _Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society_, V. 162.\r\n\r\n[485] Benjamin Fabre, _Eques a Capite Galeato_, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[486] Benjamin Fabre, op cit., pp. 88, 90, 98, 110.\r\n\r\n[487] Clavel, _Histoire pittoresque_, pp. 188, 390; Robison's _Proofs of\r\na Conspiracy_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[488] _The Royal Masonic Cyclopædia_ describes both _Nathan der Weise_\r\nand _Ernst und Falk_ as prominent works on Masonry.\r\n\r\n[489] There is, however, the possibility that Lessing may have had in\r\nmind another Falk living at the same period; this was \"John Frederick\r\nFalk, born at Hamburg of Jewish parents, reported to have been head of a\r\nCabalistic College in London and to have died about 1824\" (_Tranactions\r\nof the Jewish Historical Society_, VIII. 128). But in view of the part\r\nwhich the correspondence of Savalette de Langes shows the Ba'al Shem of\r\nLondon to have played in the background of Freemasonry, it seems more\r\nprobable that he was the Falk in question. At any rate, both were Jews\r\nand Cabalists.\r\n\r\n[490] Who can this have been?\r\n\r\n[491] The Duchesse de Gontaut relates in her _Mémoires_ that the Due\r\nd'Orléans was one day driving through the forest of Fontainebleau when a\r\nman, half clothed and with a demented air, sprang towards the carriage,\r\ngrimacing horribly. The Duke's suite, taking him for a madman, would\r\nhave kept him at bay, but the Duke, at that moment awaking from sleep,\r\nunbuttoned his shirt and showed his assailant an iron ring suspended\r\nround his neck. At this sight the man took to his heels and disappeared\r\ninto the wood. The mystery of this incident was never elucidated, and\r\nthe Duke, when questioned on the matter, would offer no explanation.\r\nCould this ring have been Falk's talisman?\r\n\r\n[492] Margoliouth, op. cit., II. 121-4.

Barthou's résumé instead of making\r\none of my own, lest I should be said to have made judicious selections\r\nin order to suit the purpose of showing the resemblance between this\r\nMemoir and the passage from Mirabeau's other writings which follows. But\r\nM. Barthou's impartiality cannot be impugned, for he appears to know\r\nnothing about the Illuminati or Mirabeau's connexion with them, and\r\nregards the Memoir in question as solely the outcome of Mirabeau's mind\r\nwhich had \"ripened\" since 1772.\r\n\r\n[512] F. Barthou, _Mirabeau_, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[513] In the Memoir drawn up by Mirabeau quoted above we find this\r\npassage: \"It must be a fundamental rule never to allow any prince to\r\nenter the association were he a god for virtue.\"--_Mémoires de\r\nMirabeau_, III. 60.\r\n\r\n[514] _Histoire de la Monarchie Prussienne_, V. 99.\r\n\r\n[515] Henry Martin, _Histoire de France_, XVI. 533.\r\n\r\n[516] Louis Blanc, _Histoire de la Révolution Française_, II. 84.\r\n\r\n[517] _History of Freemasonry_, III. 121.\r\n\r\n[518] _Originalschriften_, p. 258.\r\n\r\n[519] Ibid., p. 297.\r\n\r\n[520] Ibid., p. 285.\r\n\r\n[521] Ibid., p. 286.\r\n\r\n[522] _Originalschriften_, p. 300.

Nevertheless, both Mackey and\r\nOliver proceed to revile Barruel and Robison as enemies of Masonry, and\r\nin order to substantiate this accusation Oliver descends to the most\r\nflagrant misquotation. For if we look up in the original the passages he\r\nquotes on page 382 from Robison and on page 573 from Barruel as evidence\r\nof their calumnies on Masonry, we shall find that they refer\r\nrespectively to the Rose-Croix Cabalists and the Illuminati and not to\r\nthe Freemasons at all!

This is precisely Weishaupt's idea.\r\n\r\n[596] In 1779 Spartacus writes to Marius and Cato suggesting that\r\ninstead of Illuminati the Order should be called the \"Order of Bees\r\n[Bienenorden oder Bienengesellschaft],\" and that all the statutes should\r\nbe clothed in this allegory--_Originalschriften_, p. 320.\r\n\r\n[597] _Nachtrag von ...

Thus Weishaupt writes:\r\n\"I must attempt to cure him of theosophy and bring him round to our\r\nviews\" (_Nachtrag von ...

But apart from\r\nthe fact that Mirabeau as an Illuminatus was unlikely himself to\r\ndenounce the Order, the proof that he was not the author may be found at\r\nthe British Museum, where the copy of the 1792 edition bears on the\r\ntitle-page the words in ink \"Donné par l'auteur,\" and Mirabeau died in\r\nthe spring of the preceding year.\r\n\r\n[615] British Museum press-mark F. 259 (14).\r\n\r\n[616] _Oeuvres posthumes de Marmontel_, IV. 77.\r\n\r\n[617] Lombard de Langres, _Histoire des Jacobins_, p. 31 (1820).\r\n\r\n[618] Deschamps, _Les Sociétés Secrètes et la Société_, II. 151, quoting\r\ndocument amongst the papers of Cardinal Bernis entitled: _Discours\r\nprononcé au comité de la Propagande par M.

United States! What a fine sound it has when one looks at the\r\nEurope of to-day!\" A review named _Les États-Unis d'Europe_ existed as\r\nearly as 1868, and M. Goyau shows that this formula and also that of the\r\n\"République Universelle\" were slogans current amongst the pacifists\r\nbefore and during the war of 1870 which they signally failed to\r\navert.--_L'Idée de Patrie et l'Humanitarisme_, pp. 113, 115.\r\n\r\n[742] How bitterly this attitude is still resented by the Jews is shown\r\nin the article on Jesus in the _Jewish Encyclopædia_, which observes\r\nthat: \"In almost all of his public utterances he was harsh, severe, and\r\ndistinctly unjust ... toward the ruling and well-to-do classes. After\r\nreading his diatribes against the Pharisees, the Scribes, and the rich,\r\nit is scarcely to be wondered at that these were concerned in helping to\r\nsilence him\" (vol. vii, p. 164).\r\n\r\n[743] The execution of Monseigneur Butkievitch, the Roman Catholic\r\nArchbishop of Petrograd, was condoned by the _Daily Herald_, the _New\r\nStatesman_, and the _Nation_.

A man who had been\r\nstruck with the dramatic possibilities of something I had written wrote\r\nto ask if he might place it before a certain well-known film producer in\r\nAmerica. I gave my consent, and some time later he informed me that the\r\nproducer in question regretted he could not film my work as it might\r\nappear to be anti-Bolshevist propaganda. Soon after this the same\r\nproducer brought out a film on the same subject with the moral turned\r\nround the other way, so as to make the whole thing subtly revolutionary,\r\nand brought this over to England, where he advertised it as\r\nanti-Bolshevist propaganda!

In view of the fact\r\nthat these articles were on some points at variance with my own\r\ntheories, it seems hardly necessary to state that they were not my work.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I did not know of their existence until they were\r\nin print, and later I contributed four supplementary articles signed by\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\n[868] _Spectator_ for June 12, 1920.\r\n\r\n[869] James Guillaume, _Documents de l'Internationale_, I. 131.\r\n\r\n[870] _Correspondance de Bakounine_, published by Michael Dragomanov, p.\r\n325.\r\n\r\n[871] _Le Juif_, etc., pp. 367, 368.\r\n\r\n[872] _Revolution and War or Britain's Peril and her Secret Foes_, by\r\nVigilant (1913). A great portion of this book exposing the subtle\r\npropaganda of Socialism and Pacifism is admirable; it is only where the\r\nauthor attempts to lay all this to the charge of the Jesuits that he\r\nentirely fails to substantiate his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes have been renumbered and placed after the index (before these\r\nnotes).\r\n\r\nIn the text, the symbol of a circle with a dot in the center appears\r\nfrequently. In the UTF-8 version of this e-text, this is represented\r\nusing Unicode character U+2299 CIRCLED DOT OPERATOR ⊙.\r\n\r\nIn some places in the text, abbreviations are made using three dots in\r\nthe form of a triangle. In the UTF-8 versions of this e-text, this is\r\nrepresented using U+2234 THEREFORE ∴.\r\n\r\nWhere obvious, typos have been corrected in the text and marked with an\r\nalphabetic footnote. Details of each change are listed below.\r\n\r\n[A] Changed \"centry\" to \"century\".\r\n\r\n[B] Changed \"Pavly\" to \"Pauly\".\r\n\r\n[C] Changed \"l'Élise\" to \"l'Église\".\r\n\r\n[D] Changed \"Mara\" to \"Marx\".",
