Coraÿ and Groskurd conclude, though by a somewhat\r\ndifferent argument, that he was born in the year B. C. 66, and the\r\nlatter that he died A. D. 24. The date of his birth as argued by\r\nGroskurd, proceeds on the assumption that Strabo was in his\r\nthirty-eighth year when he went from Gyaros to Corinth, at which latter\r\nplace Octavianus Cæsar was then staying on his return to Rome after the\r\nbattle of Actium, B. C. 31. We may, perhaps, be satisfied with following\r\nClinton, and place it not later than B. C. 54.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th book our author speaks of the death of Juba as a recent\r\noccurrence. This event took place A. D. 21, or A. D. 18 or 19, according\r\nto other chronologists; he, therefore, outlived that king, but for how\r\nlong a period we have no means of ascertaining.\r\n\r\nThe only information which we can obtain of the personal history of\r\nStrabo is to be collected from the scanty references made to himself in\r\nthe course of this work;[3] for although a writer of the Augustan age,\r\nhis name and his works appear to have been generally unknown to his\r\ncontemporaries, and to have been passed over in silence by subsequent\r\nauthors who occupied themselves with the same branch of study. The work\r\nbeing written in Greek, and the subject itself not of a popular kind,\r\nwould be hindrances to its becoming generally known; and its voluminous\r\ncharacter would prevent many copies being made; moreover, the author\r\nhimself, although for some time a resident at Rome, appears to have made\r\nAmasia his usual place of residence, and there to have composed his\r\nwork. But wherever it was, he had the means of becoming acquainted with\r\nthe chief public events that took place in the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that of his father and his father’s family he is\r\ntotally silent, but of his mother and her connexions he has left us some\r\nnotices. She was of a distinguished family who had settled at Cnossus in\r\nCrete, and her ancestors had been intimately connected with Mithridates\r\nEuergetes and Mithridates Eupator, kings of Pontus; their fortunes\r\nconsequently depended on those princes.\r\n\r\nDorylaüs, her great grandfather, was a distinguished officer, and friend\r\nof Euergetes; but the latter being assassinated at Sinope, whilst\r\nDorylaüs was engaged in levying troops in Crete, he determined to remain\r\nthere. In that island he obtained the highest honours, having\r\nsuccessfully, as general of the Cnossians, terminated a war between that\r\npeople and the Gortynians. He married a Macedonian lady, of the name of\r\nSterope; the issue of which marriage was Lagetas, Stratarchas, and a\r\ndaughter. He died in Crete. Lagetas had a daughter, who, says Strabo,\r\nwas “the mother of my mother”.\r\n\r\nMithridates Eupator, who succeeded to the kingdom of Pontus on the death\r\nof his father, had formed from infancy a close friendship with another\r\nDorylaüs, son of Philetærus (brother of the first-mentioned Dorylaüs),\r\nand besides conferring on him distinguished honours, appointed him high\r\npriest of Comana Pontica. The king extended also his protection to his\r\ncousins, Lagetas and Stratarchas, who were recalled from Crete. The\r\nprosperity of the family suddenly terminated by the discovery of an\r\nintrigue carried on by Dorylaüs with the Romans, for the overthrow of\r\nhis benefactor. The motives assigned by Strabo for his disaffection and\r\ntreachery were the declining prospects of the king, and the execution\r\nof his son Theophilus and a nephew Tibius.\r\n\r\nDorylaüs made overtures to Lucullus for the revolt of the kingdom of\r\nPontus to the Romans, and in return received great promises of reward,\r\nwhich were never fulfilled. Lucullus ceased to command in the war, and\r\nwas succeeded by Pompey, who, through enmity and jealousy, prevailed on\r\nthe senate not to confirm the conditions entered into by his\r\npredecessor. As before observed, there is no mention of Strabo’s father\r\nin the works which have come down to us. Malte-Brun, in his Life of\r\nStrabo in the Biographie Universelle, collects several passages tending\r\nto show that he was a Roman. The name of Strabo, or “squinting,”\r\noriginally Greek, was used by the Romans, and applied to the father of\r\nPompey the Great, among others. How the geographer acquired this name is\r\nnot related.\r\n\r\nWhen a very young man, he received instruction in grammar and rhetoric\r\nfrom Aristodemus, at Nysa in Caria.[4] He afterwards studied philosophy\r\nunder Xenarchus of Seleucia, the Peripatetic philosopher.[5] Strabo does\r\nnot say whether he heard him at Seleucia in Cilicia, or at Rome, where\r\nhe afterwards taught.\r\n\r\nStrabo also attended the lessons of Tyrannio of Amisus,[6] the\r\ngrammarian. This must have been at Rome; for Tyrannio was made prisoner\r\nby Lucullus, B. C. 71, and carried to Rome, probably not later than B.\r\nC. 66.\r\n\r\nIn book xvi.,[7] Strabo states that he studied the philosophy of\r\nAristotle with Boethus of Sidon, who afterwards became a Stoic\r\nphilosopher. Notwithstanding all these advantages, Strabo was not\r\npossessed of all the knowledge of his times, particularly in astronomy\r\nand mathematics, but he was well acquainted with history and the\r\nmythological traditions of his nation. He was a devout admirer of Homer,\r\nand acquainted with the other great poets.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical sect to which he belonged was the Stoic, as plainly\r\nappears from many passages in his Geography.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a History, which he describes (vol. i. p. 21) as composed in a\r\nlucid style; it is cited by Plutarch, and also by Josephus in his\r\nJewish Antiquities, xiv. 7. It consisted of forty-three books, which\r\nbegan where the history of Polybius ended, and was probably continued to\r\nthe battle of Actium. This valuable History is lost.\r\n\r\nStrabo was a great traveller, and apparently had no professional or\r\nother occupation. We may therefore conclude that his father left him a\r\ngood property. Much of his geographical information is the result of\r\npersonal observation. In a passage of his 2nd book[8] he thus speaks:\r\n“Our descriptions shall consist of what we ourselves have observed in\r\nour travels by land and sea, and of what we conceive to be credible in\r\nthe statements and writings of others; for in a westerly direction we\r\nhave travelled from Armenia to that part of Tyrrhenia which is over\r\nagainst Sardinia; and southward, from the Euxine to the frontiers of\r\nEthiopia. Of all the writers on geography, not one can be mentioned who\r\nhas travelled over a wider extent of the countries described than we\r\nhave. Some may have gone farther to the west, but then they have never\r\nbeen so far east as we have; again, others may have been farther east,\r\nbut not so far west; and the same with respect to north and south.\r\nHowever, in the main, both we and they have availed ourselves of the\r\nreports of others, from which to describe the form, size, and other\r\npeculiarities of the country.” He mentions having been in Egypt, the\r\nisland Gyarus, Populonium near Elba, Comana in Cappadocia, Ephesus,\r\nMylasa, Nysa, and Hierapolis in Phrygia. He visited Corinth, Argos,\r\nAthens, and Megara; but, on the whole, he does not appear to have seen\r\nmore of Greece than in passing through it on his way to Brundusium,\r\nwhile proceeding to Rome. Populonium and Luna in Italy were the limit of\r\nhis travels northwards. It is probable he obtained his information as to\r\nSpain, France, Britain, and Germany, while staying at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe first systematic writer on geography was Eratosthenes, who died at\r\nthe age of 80, about B. C. 196. His work consisted of three books.\r\n\r\nThere is no ground for considering the Geography of Strabo an improved\r\nedition of that of Eratosthenes. Strabo’s work was intended for the\r\ninformation of persons in the higher departments of administration, and\r\ncontains such geographical and historical information as those engaged\r\nin political employments cannot dispense with. Consistently with this\r\nobject he avoids giving minute descriptions, except where the place is\r\nof real interest, but supplies some account of the important political\r\nevents that had occurred in various countries, and sketches of the great\r\nmen who had flourished or laboured in them. It is a lively, well-written\r\nbook, intended to be read, and forms a striking contrast to the\r\nGeography of Ptolemy. His language is simple, appropriate to the matter,\r\nwithout affectation, and mostly clear and intelligible, except in those\r\npassages where the text has been corrupted. Like many other Greeks,\r\nStrabo looked upon Homer as the depository of all knowledge, but he\r\nfrequently labours to interpret the poet’s meaning in a manner highly\r\nuncritical. What Homer only partially knew or conjectured, Strabo has\r\nmade the basis of his description, when he might have given an\r\nindependent description, founded on the actual knowledge of his time:\r\nthese observations apply especially to his books on Greece. He does not\r\nduly appreciate Herodotus; nor does he discriminate between the stories\r\nwhich Herodotus tells simply as stories he had heard, and the accounts\r\nhe relates as derived from personal observation. He likewise rejects the\r\nevidence of Pytheas of Marseilles as to the northern regions of Europe,\r\nand on more than one occasion calls him a liar, although it is very\r\ncertain that Pytheas coasted along the whole distance from Gadeira, now\r\nCadiz, in Spain, to the river he calls Tanaïs, but which was probably\r\nthe Elbe; however, from the extracts which have been preserved it seems\r\nthat he did not give simply the results of his own observations, but\r\nadded reports which he collected respecting distant countries, without\r\nalways drawing a distinction between what he saw himself and what was\r\nderived from the report of others.\r\n\r\nStrabo’s authorities are for the most part Greek, and he seems to have\r\nneglected the Latin memoirs and historical narratives of the campaigns\r\nof the Romans, which might have furnished him with many valuable\r\ngeographical facts for the countries as well of Asia as of Europe. He\r\nmade some use of Cæsar’s description of France, the Alps, and Britain;\r\nhe alludes to the voyage of Publius Crassus in speaking of the\r\nCassiterides, and also the writings of Asinius Pollio, Fabius Pictor,\r\nand an anonymous writer whom he calls the Chorographer; but he might\r\nhave obtained much additional information if he had taken pains to\r\navail himself of the materials he could have procured during his stay at\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nStrabo considered that mathematical and astronomical knowledge was\r\nindispensable to the science of geography; he says in book i.,[9] that\r\nwithout some such assistance it would be impossible to be accurately\r\nacquainted with the configuration of the earth; and that every one who\r\nundertakes to give an accurate description of a place, should describe\r\nits astronomical and geometrical relations, and explain its extent,\r\ndistance, latitude, and climate.[10] As the size of the earth, he says,\r\nhas been demonstrated by other writers, we shall take for granted what\r\nthey have advanced. We shall also assume that the earth is spheroidal,\r\nand that bodies have a tendency towards its centre. He likewise says,\r\nthe convexity of the sea is a further proof that the earth is spheroidal\r\nto those who have sailed; for they cannot perceive lights at a distance\r\nwhen placed at the same level as their eyes, but if raised on high, they\r\nat once become perceptible.[11] He also observes, “our gnomons are,\r\namong other things, evidence of the revolution of the heavenly bodies,\r\nand common sense at once shows us that if the depth of the earth were\r\ninfinite, such a revolution could not take place.”[12] But Strabo did\r\nnot consider the exact division of the earth into climates or zones, in\r\nthe sense in which Hipparchus used the term, and the statement of the\r\nlatitudes and longitudes of places, which in many instances were pretty\r\nwell determined in his time, as essential to his geographical\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the lost continent of Atlantis, Strabo is very cautious\r\nin criticising[13] Poseidonius; he observes, “he did well, too, in\r\nciting the opinion of Plato, that the tradition concerning the island of\r\nAtlantis might be received as something more than a mere fiction, it\r\nhaving been related by Solon, on the authority of the Egyptian priests,\r\nthat this island, almost as large as a continent, was formerly in\r\nexistence, although now it had disappeared,” and remarks that\r\nPoseidonius thought it better to quote this than to say, He who brought\r\nit into existence can also cause it to disappear, as the poet did the\r\nwall of the Achivi.\r\n\r\nThe measure adopted by Strabo was the stadium. In book vii. chap. vii.\r\n§ 4, he says, “From Apollonia to Macedonia is the Egnatian Way; its\r\ndirection is towards the east, and the distance is measured by pillars\r\nat every mile, as far as Cypsela and the river Hebrus. The whole\r\ndistance is 535 miles. But reckoning, as the generality of persons do, a\r\nmile at eight stadia, there may be 4280 stadia. And, according to\r\nPolybius, who adds two plethra, which are a third of a stadium, to every\r\neight stadia we must add 178 stadia more,—a third part of the number of\r\nmiles.” In book xi. chap. xi. § 5, he compares the parasang with the\r\nstadium, and states that some writers reckoned it at 60, others at 40,\r\nand others at 30 stadia.\r\n\r\nDr. Smith, in his Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, says, “We\r\nthink that Ukert has satisfactorily shown an accurate description of a\r\nplace should be particular to add its astronomical and geometrical\r\nrelations, explaining carefully its extent, distance, degrees of\r\nlatitude, and temperature of atmosphere. He says likewise, as the size\r\nof the earth has been demonstrated by other writers, we shall take for\r\ngranted that the Greeks had not different standards of length, but\r\nalways used the Olympic stadium and the foot corresponding to it. He\r\nstates that the stadium was equal to 600 Greek, or 625 Roman feet, or to\r\n125 Roman paces, and the Roman mile contained 8 stadia. Hence the\r\nstadium contained 606 feet 9 inches, English. This standard prevailed\r\nthroughout Greece under the name of the Olympic stadium, because it was\r\nthe exact length of the stadium or foot-race course at Olympia, measured\r\nbetween the pillars at the two extremities of the course.” Still Dr.\r\nSmith further observes, “But although the stadium and the foot connected\r\nwith it were single definite measures throughout Greece, yet we find in\r\nthe eastern countries, Babylon, Syria, and Egypt, and in some\r\nneighbouring Greek states, feet longer than the Olympic, the origin of\r\nwhich is to be explained by the coëxistence, in the Babylonian system,\r\nof a _royal_ or _sacred_ and a _common_ foot and cubit, which were so\r\nrelated to one another, that the royal cubit was three finger-breadths\r\nlonger than the common.”\r\n\r\nWe may conclude that Strabo’s stadium varied considerably, as he\r\nsometimes received his distance from personal observation or credible\r\nreport, and often quoted other writers, and reduced other standards, as\r\nthe mile, the parasang, and the schœnus, to the stadium. In addition to\r\nthis, the most ancient mode of reckoning distances was by the number of\r\ndays required to perform the journey, and this was transferred into\r\nstadia by reckoning a certain number of stadia to a day’s journey.[14]\r\n\r\nSiebenkees and Heeren (De Fontibus Geographicorum Strabonis) have\r\nexamined the authorities to which Strabo had, or might have had, access,\r\nand Groskurd has availed himself of their researches.\r\n\r\nThe following is a short summary of the seventeen books from these\r\nsources, but for a more detailed account of their contents the\r\ntranslation itself must be referred to.\r\n\r\nThe first two books may be considered as an independent treatise, and by\r\nthemselves form a remarkable contrast with the rest of the work, in the\r\nmanner of treating the subjects, and in the difficulties which they\r\npresent both of language and matter.\r\n\r\nIn the 1st book, the author enters into a long discussion on the merits\r\nof Homer, whom he considers to have been the earliest geographer, and\r\ndefends him against the errors and misconceptions of Eratosthenes. He\r\ncorrects some faults of Eratosthenes, and, in his inquiry concerning the\r\nnatural changes of the earth’s surface defends Eratosthenes against\r\nHipparchus. In conclusion, he again corrects Eratosthenes as regards the\r\nmagnitude and divisions of the inhabited world. The most remarkable\r\npassage in this book is that in which he conjectures the existence of\r\nthe great Western Continents.[15]\r\n\r\nThe 2nd book is chiefly occupied with some accounts of mathematical\r\ngeography, and the Author defends against Hipparchus the division of the\r\ninhabited world adopted by Eratosthenes into sections. Then follows a\r\ncriticism of the division of the earth into six zones, as taught by\r\nPoseidonius and Polybius. The pretended circumnavigation of Africa by\r\nEudoxus is referred to, as well as some geographical errors of Polybius.\r\nHe makes observations of his own on the form and size of the earth in\r\ngeneral, as well as of the inhabited portion of it, describing the\r\nmethod of representing it on a spherical or plane surface. A short\r\noutline is given of seas, countries, and nations; and he concludes with\r\nremarks on the system of climates,[16] and on the shadows projected by\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd book commences with Iberia, and the subject of Europe is\r\ncontinued to the end of the 10th book. His references are the Periplus\r\nof Artemidorus, Polybius, and Poseidonius; all three of whom wrote as\r\neye-witnesses. For descriptions and measurement of distances,\r\nArtemidorus is chiefly depended upon. The information possessed by\r\nEratosthenes of these countries was meagre and uncertain. For the\r\nnations of southern Iberia, he adopts the account of Asclepiades of\r\nMyrlea, who had lived and been educated there. Some statements also are\r\nborrowed from Roman authors.\r\n\r\nThe 4th book contains Gallia, according to the four divisions then\r\nexisting, viz. Gallia Narbonensis, Acquitanensis, Lugdunensis, and the\r\nBelgæ; also Britain, with Ierne, and Thule; and lastly, the Alps.\r\n\r\nHere Eratosthenes and Ephorus are of little service. His chief guide is\r\nJulius Cæsar, whom he frequently quotes _verbatim_. Polybius is his\r\nguide for the Alps. Pytheas is the source of some scanty information\r\nrespecting Ierne and Thule. Throughout his description he adds accounts\r\nobtained at Rome from travellers.\r\n\r\nThe 5th book commences with a general sketch of Italy, and refers\r\nprincipally to northern Italy. Dividing its history into ancient and\r\nmodern, his chief reference for the former is Polybius, and for the\r\nlatter we are indebted to the observations of the author himself, or to\r\naccounts received from others. Still the description of Upper Italy is\r\npoor and unsatisfactory, from the author not sufficiently availing\r\nhimself of Roman resources. Then follows some account of Etruria with\r\nits neighbouring islands, Umbria, Samnium, Latium, and Rome, chiefly the\r\nresult of the author’s own researches and observations. The book\r\nconcludes with some remarks on the inhabitants of the mountainous\r\ndistricts of Samnium and Campania.\r\n\r\nThe 6th book is a continuation of the same subject. Magna Græcia,\r\nSicily, and the adjacent islands, are noticed, and the author concludes\r\nwith a short discussion on the extent of the Roman Empire. Descriptions\r\nof some places are from his own observations; but the sources whence he\r\ntakes his other account of Italy and the islands are the works of\r\nPolybius, Eratosthenes, Artemidorus, Ephorus, Fabius Pictor, Cæcilius\r\n(of Cale Acte in Sicily), and some others, besides an anonymous\r\nchorographer, supposed to be a Roman, from the circumstance of his\r\ndistances being given, not in stadia, but in Roman miles.\r\n\r\nThe 7th book relates, first, to the people north of the Danube,—the\r\nGermans, Cimbri, Getæ, Dacians (particularly the European Scythians),\r\nand the Crimea; secondly, to the people south of the Danube, viz. those\r\ninhabiting Illyricum, Pannonia, Dalmatia, the eastern coast of Thrace to\r\nthe Euxine, Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace, and the Hellespont. The latter\r\npart of this book is not preserved entire in any manuscript, but Kramer\r\nhas, in his own opinion, succeeded in restoring from the epitomes left\r\nto us the greater part of what was wanting. Of Germany, Strabo had\r\ntolerable information, but he nowhere states whence it is derived; he\r\nmay have been partly indebted to Asinius Pollio, whose work he had\r\nalready examined for the Rhine. For the remaining northern countries, he\r\nhad Poseidonius and the historians of the Mithridatic war. For the\r\nsouthern countries, he had a lost work of Aristotle on forms of\r\ngovernment, Polybius, Poseidonius, and his chief disciples, Theopompus\r\nand Ephorus. Incidentally also he quotes Homer and his interpreters, and\r\nPhilochorus.\r\n\r\nThe three following books are dedicated to the description of Greece,\r\nwith the adjacent islands. The 8th comprises the Peloponnesus and its\r\nwell-known seven provinces, Elis, Messenia, Laconia, Argolis, Corinthia\r\nwith Sicyonia, Achaia, and Arcadia: the 9th, Attica, with Megaris,\r\nBœotia, Phocis, both Locri and Thessaly: the 10th, Eubœa, Ætolia, and\r\nAcarnania, with the islands. After a long digression on the subject of\r\nthe Curetes, the description of Europe closes with some account of Crete\r\nand the islands of the Ægean Sea. The design and construction of these\r\nthree books differ considerably from the preceding. Homer is adopted as\r\nthe foundation of his geographical descriptions; some things Strabo must\r\nhave learnt as an eye-witness, but more from _vivâ voce_ communications\r\nat Athens or at Corinth. All is interwoven together without any clear\r\nline of separation, and the result is some confusion. Athens, Corinth,\r\nArgos, and their neighbourhood, were the only parts of Greece our author\r\nsaw. Heeren, indeed maintains that he had seen the whole of it, and the\r\nArchipelago, but satisfactory proof of this is altogether wanting.\r\n\r\nThe 11th book commences with the description of the countries separated\r\nfrom Europe by the Tanaïs or Don. Asia is divided by our author (who\r\nhere follows Eratosthenes) into two parts by the Taurus, which runs in a\r\ndirection east and west. The northern part of Asia (or this side Taurus)\r\nis divided into four parts. The first part comprises the countries lying\r\nbetween the Don, the Sea of Azoff, the Euxine, and the Caspian; the\r\nsecond, the countries east of the Caspian; and the third, the countries\r\nsouth of Caucasus. These three parts of the first or northern division\r\nof Asia are contained in the 10th book; the remaining fourth part\r\noccupies the 12th, 13th, and 14th books.\r\n\r\nThe chief authorities for the first part are, besides information\r\nobtained from travellers and merchants at Amasia, Herodotus for the Don;\r\nArtemidorus and Eratosthenes for distances; Poseidonius and Theophanes\r\nof Mitylene, historians, of the Mithridatic war; Metrodorus of Skepsis;\r\nHypsicrates of Amisus; and Cleitarchus for the digression on the\r\nAmazons.\r\n\r\nFor the second part, are principally Patrocles and Aristobulus,\r\nhistorians of the Asiatic campaigns of Alexander. For the third part, or\r\nMedia and Armenia, are, Dellius, who wrote a history of the war against\r\nthe Parthians, in which he had served under Antony; Apollonides of\r\nNicæa, who wrote a Periplus of Europe; and other writers before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe 12th book commences with a detailed account of Anatolia, and\r\ncontains the northern part. It was to have been expected that Strabo\r\nwould have described most of these countries as an eye-witness, lying,\r\nas they do, so near his native country, Cappadocia. But this expectation\r\nvanishes, when we discover the meagreness of his account. With the\r\nexception of Pontus and Cappadocia, he had seen little of the rest, and\r\ndepends upon historians and oral information. For earlier times, his\r\nauthorities are Herodotus, Hellanicus, Theopompus, Ephorus, Artemidorus,\r\nApollodorus, and Demetrius of Skepsis; for later times, historians of\r\nthe wars of Mithridates and Pompey. For the ancient history of the\r\nMysians and Phrygians, he is indebted to the celebrated Lydian historian\r\nXanthus, and Menecrates.\r\n\r\nThe 13th book continues the description of Anatolia. The greater part of\r\nthe book is occupied with a dissertation on the Troad. Strabo had\r\ntravelled over the country himself, but his great authority is Homer and\r\nDemetrius of Skepsis, the author of a work in twenty-six books,\r\ncontaining an historical and geographical commentary on that part of the\r\nsecond book of the Iliad, in which the forces of the Trojans are\r\nenumerated. A learned digression on the Leleges, Cilices, and Pelasgi,\r\nwho preceded the Æolians and Ionians in the occupation of the country,\r\nis principally taken from Menecrates and Demetrius of Skepsis. The\r\ndescription then turns to the interior, and the account of the Æolian\r\ncities is probably due to Poseidonius. Throughout this book are\r\nevidences of great care and desire for accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe 14th book continues with the remainder of Anatolia, and an account\r\nof the islands Samos, Chios, Rhodes, and Cyprus. The authorities\r\nfollowed are, on the whole, the same as in the previous book—Herodotus,\r\nThucydides, Ephorus, Artemidorus, Eratosthenes, and Poseidonius; besides\r\nPherecydes of Syros, who wrote on the Ionian migration, and Anaximenes\r\nof Lampsacus, the author of a history in Greek of the Milesian colonies.\r\nFor Caria, he had the historians of Alexander and an author named\r\nPhilip, who wrote on the Leleges and Carians. For Cyprus he had Damastes\r\nand Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\nThe 15th and 16th books contain a description of the second portion of\r\nAsia, namely, the southern or the other side of Taurus. In the 15th\r\nbook, Strabo describes India and Persia, the latter in two chief\r\ndivisions, viz. Ariana or East Persia, and Persis or West Persia. These\r\ncountries Strabo never saw; his description, therefore, is founded on\r\nthe authority of travellers and historians. The topography of India is\r\nmeagre, and limited to a few towns and rivers; but his account of the\r\npeople of the country is more copious, he being supplied with materials\r\nfrom the historians of Alexander and of the campaigns of Seleucus in\r\nIndia. He looks on Megasthenes, Onesicritus, Deïmachus, and Cleitarchus\r\nas fabulous writers: but his confidence rests chiefly on Patrocles,\r\nAristobulus (one of the companions and historians of Alexander), and\r\nNearchus, the chief commander of Alexander’s fleet. Artemidorus and\r\nNicolaus of Damascus are occasionally consulted. For Ariana or East\r\nPersia, he had for his principal authority Eratosthenes; and for Persia\r\nProper, he had, besides the above authors, Herodotus, Xenophon, and\r\nPolycletus of Larissa, an historian of Alexander.\r\n\r\nIn the 16th book, he describes the westerly half of south Asia, viz.\r\nAssyria with Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Phœnicia, and Palestine, the\r\nPersian and Arabian Gulfs, the coast of Ethiopia, and lastly, Arabia.\r\nFor the three first countries (the old Assyrian kingdom), his chief\r\nauthorities are, besides some of Alexander’s historians, Eratosthenes,\r\nPoseidonius, and Herodotus; for the remainder he had, in addition to the\r\nsame writers, Artemidorus, and probably also Nicolaus of Damascus. The\r\naccount of Moses and the Jews, Heeren surmises, comes from Poseidonius,\r\nbut it probably proceeds from oral communication had in Egypt; of these\r\ncountries our author could describe nothing as an eye-witness, except\r\nthe north-west of Syria. The accounts of Arabia, the Indian and the Red\r\nSeas, are from Agatharchides; and much that he describes of Arabia was\r\nobtained from his friends, Ælius Gallus and the Stoic, Athenodorus.\r\n\r\nThe 17th book concludes the work with the description of Egypt,\r\nEthiopia, and the north coast of Africa. Strabo had travelled through\r\nthe whole of Egypt, as far as Syene and Philæ, and writes with the\r\ndecided tone of an eye-witness. Much verbal information, also, he\r\ncollected at Alexandria. His most important written authorities are, for\r\nthe Nile, Eratosthenes (who borrowed from Aristotle), Eudoxus, and\r\nAristo. For the most remarkable events of Egyptian history, he had\r\nPolybius, and for later times probably Poseidonius, besides _vivâ voce_\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nFor the oracle at Ammon, he had the historians of Alexander; for\r\nEthiopia, the accounts of Petronius, who had carried on war there,\r\nAgatharchides, and Herodotus. Of Libya or Africa Proper he had nothing\r\nnew or authentic to say. Besides Eratosthenes, Artemidorus, and\r\nPoseidonius, his chief authorities, he had Iphicrates, who wrote on the\r\nplants and animals of Libya. The whole concludes with a short notice of\r\nthe Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe dates at which particular books were written, as attempted to be\r\ngiven by Groskurd and Coraÿ, must be received with caution.\r\n\r\nIn book iv. c. vi. § 9, Strabo says that the Carni and Taurisci had\r\nquietly paid tribute for thirty-three years; and both these tribes were\r\nreduced to subjection by Tiberius and Drusus, B. C. 14. This book was\r\ntherefore written in A. D. 19.\r\n\r\nIn book vi. c. iv. § 2, Cæsar Germanicus is spoken of as still living.\r\nHe died in Syria, A. D. 20 (19). This book was therefore written before\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nIn book xii. c. viii. § 11, Strabo says that Cyzicus was still a free\r\nstate. It lost its liberty A. D. 25. This book was therefore written\r\nbefore A. D. 25. Whether Strabo was alive or dead at this date, we have\r\nno means of determining.\r\n\r\nThe codices or manuscripts which exist of Strabo’s work appear to be\r\ncopies of a single manuscript existing in the middle ages, but now lost.\r\nFrom the striking agreement of errors and omissions in all now extant\r\n(with such differences only as can be accounted for, arising from the\r\nwant of ability or carelessness of the copyist), it appears most\r\nprobable that to this single manuscript we are indebted for the\r\npreservation of the work. Strabo himself describes the carelessness of\r\nbad scribes both at Rome and Alexandria,[17] in the following expressive\r\nlanguage: “Some vendors of books, also, employed bad scribes and\r\nneglected to compare the copies with the originals. This happens in the\r\ncase of other books, which are copied for sale both here and at\r\nAlexandria.” After what Kramer has done for the text, we can hope for\r\nlittle improvement, unless, what is beyond all expectation, some other\r\nmanuscript should be discovered which is either derived from another\r\nsource, or is a more correct copy.\r\n\r\nThe following is some account of those in existence:—\r\n\r\nCodices in the Imperial Library, Paris:\r\n\r\n1. No. 1397 of the catalogue. This is the principal codex existing in\r\nthe Imperial Library, and was written in the 12th century. It was\r\nformerly in the Strozzi Palace at Rome, and was brought to Paris by\r\nMaria de Medici. Not only are parts of the leaves, but even whole leaves\r\nof the 9th book, damaged or destroyed by damp, mice, bad binding, and\r\ncareless attempts at correction. This codex contains the first nine\r\nbooks; the second part, containing the last eight, is lost. Collated by\r\nKramer, and partly for Falconer, by Villebrune.\r\n\r\n2. No. 1393 of the catalogue. On this codex Brequigny chiefly depended\r\nfor his edition. Montfaucon says that it is of the 12th or 13th\r\ncentury; Kramer, however, judging from the character of the handwriting\r\nand contractions, maintains that it belongs to the end of the 13th or\r\nbeginning of the 14th century. It contains the whole seventeen books of\r\nthe Geography, and was written in the East (not, however, by the same\r\nhand throughout), and brought from Constantinople to Paris by the Abbé\r\nServin in 1732, to whom it had been presented by a Greek named\r\nMaurocordato. Collated by Villebrune for Falconer, and partly by Kramer.\r\n\r\n3. No. 1408 contains the seventeen books, and appears to have been\r\nwritten towards the end of the 15th century. In general, the geography\r\nof Strabo is divided by transcribers into two parts, the first\r\ncontaining nine books, the second, the last eight; but in this codex\r\nthere is a blank leaf inserted between the 10th and 11th books, from\r\nwhich it would appear that there was also another division of the work,\r\nseparating the subjects, Europe and Asia. Partly collated by Villebrune\r\nfor Falconer.\r\n\r\n4. No. 1394. This contains the seventeen books, and is very beautifully\r\nwritten, and illuminated with arabesque designs. It was made by the\r\norder of Lorenzo the Magnificent; and its date, therefore, is after the\r\nmiddle of the 15th century. Collated, as before, by Villebrune.\r\n\r\n5. No. 1396 contains the whole seventeen books, and was probably written\r\nabout the end of the 15th or the beginning of the 16th century. The\r\ndivision of the work is into ten books and seven books. In the\r\nbeginning, it is stated to be “the gift of Antony the Eparch to Francis\r\nthe great and illustrious king of France.” Partly collated by Kramer.\r\n\r\n6. No. 1395 contains the whole seventeen books, and served for the\r\nAldine edition of Strabo. The handwriting of this codex is excellent,\r\nbut the order of the words is arbitrarily changed, and there are\r\nfrequent omissions, sometimes even of whole lines: it is corrupt beyond\r\ndescription, and among the worst we possess. Collated in some parts by\r\nKramer.\r\n\r\nNo. 1398, written about the end of the 15th century. It contains the\r\nepitome of the first ten books, by Gemistus Pletho, and the last seven\r\nbooks entire. It is a copy of No. 397, in the Library of St. Mark,\r\nVenice. Collated by Villebrune.\r\n\r\nCodices in the Vatican:\r\n\r\nNo. 1329 of the catalogue. This codex dates from the beginning,\r\nprobably, of the 14th century, and is remarkable for being the work of\r\nthirteen different transcribers. It is much to be lamented, that the\r\ngreater part of it is lost; it begins from the end of the 12th book\r\nonly, and a part of the last leaf of the 17th book is also destroyed;\r\nwhat remains to us surpasses all others in correctness of the text. The\r\nwhole has been collated for the first time by Kramer.\r\n\r\nNo. 174 is of the 15th century, and contains the seventeen books: the\r\nfirst nine books are written by one transcriber, the last eight by\r\nanother hand. The first nine books have been collated by Kramer.\r\n\r\nNo. 173 contains the first ten books, and is of the middle of the 15th\r\ncentury. It is badly and incorrectly written. The last seven books,\r\nwhich would complete the codex, are, as Kramer conjectures from the\r\npaper and handwriting, in the Library of the Grand Duchy of Parma. From\r\na note in Greek at the end of the 10th book, it appears to have been\r\nbrought to Rome A. D. 1466. Books 1, 2, 4, and 5, collated by Kramer.\r\n\r\nNo. 81 is tolerably well and correctly written. It contains the last\r\neight books, and is of the end of the 15th century. It appears to be a\r\ncopy of, or served as a copy to, the codex in the Laurentian Library,\r\nNo. 19. Partially collated by Kramer.\r\n\r\nMedicean Codices, in the Laurentian Library, Florence:\r\n\r\nCodex 5 is elegantly and correctly written; it is of the beginning,\r\nprobably, of the 15th century, and contains the first ten books. The 8th\r\nand 9th books are not entire; passages are curtailed, and much is\r\nomitted, to which the attention is not drawn, the lines being run on\r\nwithout spaces left to mark omissions. Errors of the first transcriber\r\nare corrected by a later hand, and noticed in the margin or between the\r\nlines. Collated by Bandini for Falconer, and almost the whole by Kramer.\r\n\r\nCodex 40 contains the first ten books; a copy, probably, of the former.\r\nIt was written after the middle of the 15th century.\r\n\r\nCodex 15 is of the middle of the 15th century, and contains the last\r\nseven books. It is not in any way remarkable.\r\n\r\nCodex 19, written at the end of the 15th century. It contains the last\r\neight books, and resembles No. 81 of the Vatican. Collated by Bandini\r\nfor Falconer.\r\n\r\nVenetian Codices:\r\n\r\nNo. 377 of the catalogue contains the first twelve books, and is written\r\nin the 15th century. Formerly the property of Cardinal Bessarion.\r\n\r\nNo. 378 contains the seventeen books, of which the first twelve are\r\napparently copies of the above, No. 377; the remaining five are\r\ntranscribed from some other codex. This was, also, formerly the property\r\nof Cardinal Bessarion.\r\n\r\nNo. 640 contains the last eight books. It was written, as appears from a\r\nnote A. D. 1321, by different hands. A great part of the 14th book is\r\nwanting; eight blank pages are left for the completion of it; but this\r\nwas not done by the transcriber to whom this portion was assigned. It is\r\nplaced by Kramer in the first class of manuscripts, and was wholly\r\ncollated by him.\r\n\r\nNo. 379 is of the 15th century. It contains the Epitome of Gemistus\r\nPletho of the first ten books, and the whole of the last seven books. It\r\nis the codex which served for the copy, No. 1398, in the Imperial\r\nLibrary at Paris. Formerly the property of Cardinal Bessarion.\r\n\r\nNo. 606 contains the last eight books, and was written towards the end\r\nof the 15th century. It contains nothing which is not to be found in\r\nother manuscripts.\r\n\r\nCodices in the Ambrosian Library, Milan:\r\n\r\nCodex M. 53 contains all but book ii., and is of the 15th century. The\r\nbooks are not written on paper of the same size, nor in consecutive\r\norder, although by the same hand. Book ii. is to be found in Codex N.\r\n289, together with portions of other authors, written by a different\r\ntranscriber, no doubt with the intention of completing this codex.\r\nAccording to Kramer, the first ten books are copied from Codex 5 of the\r\nMedici MS. The 13th, 14th, 12th books (the order in which they stand)\r\nfrom the Medici MS. 19, and the 11th, 15th, 16th, 17th, from the Medici\r\nMS. 15. Partly collated by Kramer.\r\n\r\nCodex G. 53 contains the seventeen books, and is of the end of the 15th\r\ncentury. Five leaves at the beginning, and two at the end, are destroyed\r\nby damp, traces of which are to be seen throughout. Partly collated by\r\nKramer.\r\n\r\nIn the Library of Eton College is a codex containing the first ten\r\nbooks; it was written at Constantinople. Kramer, who, however, did not\r\nsee it, conjectures that the Medici MS., Codex 15, containing the last\r\neight books, was formerly united to it, and completed the whole work.\r\nCollated for Falconer.\r\n\r\nIn the Library of the Escurial is a codex completed, as we are informed\r\nby a note at the end, A. D. 1423. Collated by Bayer for Falconer.\r\n\r\nThe Madrid Library possesses a codex written in the latter part of the\r\n15th century, containing the seventeen books.\r\n\r\nIn the Library at Moscow is a codex containing the seventeen books; it\r\nwas written at the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century. The\r\nfirst nine books resemble the Paris Codex, No. 1397; the last eight, the\r\nVenetian Codex, No. 640. It came from one of the monasteries of Mount\r\nAthos, and was not destroyed, as Groskurd suspects, in the great fire of\r\n1812, but is still to be found in the Library of the Holy Synod, under\r\nNo. 204 (Matt. ccv.), as I am informed by the Archimandrite Sabba, who\r\ndates from the Kremlin, April 4th, 1857.\r\n\r\nA codex also is yet to be found in one of the monasteries of Mount\r\nAthos. From the accounts of learned travellers (Zacharias, _Reise in den\r\nOrient_, and Fallmerayer, in the _Allgem. Zeitg. 5 Jun. 1843_), it\r\ncontains nothing which can supply the deficiencies of those MSS. with\r\nwhich we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nBesides the above codices, there exist four epitomes of the Geography of\r\nStrabo, of which,\r\n\r\n1. The Epitome Palatina, in the Heidelberg Library, is the oldest of all\r\nMSS. of this work. It is probably of the beginning of the 10th century,\r\nalthough Dodwell places it between 976 and 996. The codex from which it\r\nwas copied appears to have been perfect, and contained the whole of the\r\n7th book, which is imperfect in all other codices. It is, however, to be\r\nregretted that the author did not confine himself to following the text\r\nof Strabo; he has not only indulged in curtailing, transposing, and\r\nchanging the words and sentences of the original, but has sometimes also\r\nadded expressions of his own.\r\n\r\n2. The Vatican Epitome is of more value than the preceding; the extracts\r\nare more copious, the author seldom wanders from the text of Strabo, and\r\nin no instance inserts language of his own. The codex which served as\r\nthe basis for the Epitome contained the 7th book entire, and from this\r\nand the Palatine Epitome Kramer collected the fragments of the last part\r\nof the 7th book, which appear for the first time in his edition (see\r\nvol. i. of the Translation, p. 504). This codex was written in the\r\nmiddle of the 14th century, and has suffered much by time and\r\ncarelessness; several leaves are lost, and lines of the text at the top\r\nand bottom of the pages have been cut off in the binding.\r\n\r\n3. The Parisian Epitome, on which no great value is placed by Kramer.\r\n\r\n4. The Epitome of Gemistus Pletho, referred to above, is of great value,\r\nand held in the highest estimation by all editors.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of Strabo’s work in print was a Latin translation\r\nby Guarini, of Verona, and Gregorio of Tiferno. Of this, thirteen\r\neditions were printed, the first in 1469 or 1471, the twelfth in 1559,\r\nand the last in 1652. It is not known from what manuscripts the\r\ntranslation was taken, nor whether they now exist; but, though the\r\ntranslation itself is barbarous, and in many passages erroneous, its\r\nfidelity to the original is so apparent, that all editors to the present\r\ntime have consulted it as a manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the Greek text was printed at Venice by Aldus in\r\n1516, and was taken from so corrupt a manuscript that Coraÿ compares it\r\nto the Augean stable. The second edition was a repetition of the Aldine,\r\naccompanied by the Latin translation of Guarini, and was published by\r\nHopper and Heresbach, at Bâsle, in 1549. The third edition, by Xylander,\r\nin 1570, was also a repetition of the text of Aldus; but a new Latin\r\ntranslation accompanied it. The fourth and fifth editions, which do not\r\nessentially differ, were published in 1587 and 1620, by Isaac Casaubon.\r\nHe collated for his edition four manuscripts, which he obtained from his\r\nfather-in-law, H. Stephens, and was the first to add a commentary; but\r\nit is not known what manuscripts were made use of. The edition of\r\nAlmeloveen, 1707, being a reprint of Casaubon, with notes, and an\r\nedition commenced by Brequigny, Paris, 1763, but not continued beyond\r\nthe first three books, can scarcely be placed among the number of new\r\neditions. Brequigny left a French translation in manuscript and notes in\r\nLatin, which were consulted by the French translators.\r\n\r\nThe seventh edition was that of Thomas Falconer of Chester, and of\r\nBrasenose College, published in 2 vols. folio, at Oxford, 1807. For the\r\nfirst time since Casaubon’s last edition, nearly 200 years before,\r\nmanuscripts were collated for this edition, namely, those of Eton,\r\nMoscow, the Escurial, and the Laurentian library; the conjectural\r\nemendations of Tyrwhitt, and notes of the editor and others, are added.\r\n“It has everything that is valuable in Casaubon’s edition, besides\r\nhaving corrected numberless typographical errors. In the account given\r\nof it, the public are as much wronged as we are abused; for no view\r\nwhatever is laid before them of its nature or its merits.”[18] Thos.\r\nFalconer, having prepared the greater part of the work for the press,\r\ndied in 1792. A little more than the two first books were edited by John\r\nParsons, Bishop of Peterborough, and formerly Master of Balliol College,\r\nOxford; but the whole work was, ultimately, in 1802 given up to Thomas\r\nFalconer (nephew of the former), of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who\r\ncompleted it and wrote the preface. A complete revisal of the text,\r\nhowever, was not attempted.\r\n\r\nThe eighth edition was that of Professor J. P. Siebenkees, of which\r\ngreat expectations were formed. The deficiencies of his performance are\r\nstrongly commented on by Kramer. Siebenkees lived to complete only the\r\nfirst six books; the remainder of the work was undertaken by Tzchucke,\r\nand conducted with greater skill and ability than by his predecessor. It\r\nwas published in 1811, 6 vols. 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe ninth edition is that by Coraÿ, Paris, 1815-1818, 4 vols. 8vo.\r\nKramer passes an unfavourable opinion on it. The editor, according to\r\nhim, did not possess an aptitude for discriminating the value of the\r\ndifferent manuscripts he collated, and considered more what he thought\r\nought to have been written than what were really the author’s words.\r\nHence, although he was successful in restoring the true readings of many\r\npassages, he corrupted not a few, and left untouched many errors. Yet he\r\nwas a very able scholar, and has the merit of attempting the first\r\ncritical edition of Strabo.\r\n\r\nThe tenth edition is that by Professor Gustavus Kramer, in 3 vols. 8vo,\r\nthe first of which appeared in 1844, the last in 1852. The editor has\r\nbrought to his task great ability and unwearied labour; of the many\r\nyears spent in the preparation of it, were passed in Italy for the\r\npurpose of collating manuscripts. This edition surpasses all others in\r\ncompleteness, and little is left for correction by subsequent editors.\r\n\r\nA. Meineke published at Leipsic, in 3 vols., 1852, a reprint of Kramer’s\r\ntext, with some emendations of his own contained in his work,\r\n“Vindiciarum Straboniarum Liber.” Berlin, 1852.\r\n\r\nC. Müller and F. Dübner have also published the first vol., Paris, 1852,\r\nof a reprint of Kramer’s text, with Meineke’s corrections. It is\r\naccompanied by a new Latin translation, of which the first six books are\r\nby Dübner, and the remainder by Müller.\r\n\r\nIn modern languages, we have a translation by Alfonso Buonacciuoli, of\r\nFerrara, in Italian, 2 vols. 8vo, Venice, 1552. It is a very literal\r\ntranslation from a manuscript, and is frequently quoted by the French\r\ntranslators. Also a translation in German by Abr. Penzel, in 4 vols.,\r\nLemgow, 1775. It is not literal, and abounds with wilful additions and\r\nalterations of the author’s meaning.\r\n\r\nA translation in French was published at Paris in five vols. 4to, from\r\nthe year 1805 to 1819. The first three books are translated by De la\r\nPorte du Theil and Coraÿ together. The 4th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th,\r\nand 15th books are by Coraÿ; the 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, and 11th, by De la\r\nPorte du Theil; on the death of the latter, Letronne undertook the\r\ntranslation of the 16th and 17th books. The whole is accompanied by very\r\ncopious notes by the translators, and others on geographical and\r\nmathematical subjects, by Gossellin. As might be expected from the\r\nunited labour of such distinguished men, this translation, which was\r\nundertaken at the command of Napoleon I., has been held in high\r\nestimation. De la Porte du Theil, for the purpose of conveying to the\r\nreader a more accurate idea of the state of the text of the ninth book\r\nthan could be given by description or notes, has prefaced his\r\ntranslation by a copy, page for page and line for line, of the original\r\nmanuscript. The number of mutilated passages amounts to two thousand.\r\nFor the purpose of restoring the text, recourse has been had to other\r\nmanuscripts, to conjectures, to extracts from the Epitomes, and to\r\nquotations of Strabo’s work contained in the Geographical Lexicon of\r\nStephanus of Byzantium, composed before the seventh century, and in the\r\nCommentaries of Eustathius on Homer, which were written towards the end\r\nof the twelfth century. It is an example of Kramer’s just remark, that\r\nno work of any ancient author, which has descended to our time, has\r\nsuffered more from various causes.\r\n\r\nA translation by F. Ambrosoli, forming part of the “Collana degli\r\nAntichi Storici Greci,” was published in 1832, 4 vols. 8vo, Milan, and\r\nis founded on the French translation. A translation of the third book\r\n(Spain) by Lopez, was published at Madrid, 1788, and is well spoken of.\r\nThe best translation of the whole work—and too much cannot be said in\r\npraise of it—is in German, by Groskurd, 4 vols. 8vo, Berlin, 1831-1834.\r\nThe last volume contains a very copious index.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to acknowledge considerable obligations to the\r\nnotes and prefaces of Groskurd, Kramer, the French translators, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe part of the translation for which I am responsible commences at\r\nchap. iv. book vii., vol. i. p. 473, to the end of the work, and is\r\npartly based on an incomplete translation in MS. by my late father, the\r\nRev. Dr. T. Falconer. The previous portion is the work of Hans C.\r\nHamilton, Esq., F.S.A., to whom I am indebted for his continued interest\r\nin the translation throughout, for his care in correcting the press, and\r\nfor valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\nA complete index, which concludes the third volume, has been compiled\r\nwith the greatest regard to accuracy, by a gentleman of tried skill and\r\nability. It contains every geographical name mentioned by Strabo; and\r\nthe modern names, printed in italics, are also added, as far as can be\r\nascertained: they are not given with perfect confidence in all cases;\r\ndiscussion on doubtful points would have exceeded the limits of this\r\nwork; and reference may be advantageously made, where more minute detail\r\nis required, to the able articles in Dr. W. Smith’s Dictionary of Greek\r\nand Roman Geography.\r\n\r\n\r\n   W. FALCONER.\r\n\r\n   _Rectory, Bushey, Herts.\r\n   September 1, 1857._\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRABO’S GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XIV.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Fourteenth Book contains an account of the Cyclades\r\n   islands and the region opposite to them, Pamphylia, Isauria,\r\n   Lycia, Pisidia, Cilicia as far as Seleucia of Syria, and that\r\n   part of Asia properly called Ionia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There remain to be described Ionia, Caria, and the sea-coast beyond\r\nthe Taurus, which is occupied by Lycians, Pamphylians, and\r\nCilicians.[19] We shall thus finish the description of the whole circuit\r\nof the peninsula, the isthmus of which, we have said, consists of the\r\ntract between the Euxine and the Sea of Issus.\r\n\r\n2. The navigation around Ionia along the coast is about 3430 stadia. It\r\nis a considerable distance, on account of the gulfs, and of the\r\npeninsular form for the most part of the country, but the length in a\r\nstraight line is not great. The distance, for example, from Ephesus to\r\nSmyrna is a journey in a straight line of 320 stadia; to Metropolis[20]\r\nis 120 stadia, and the remainder to Smyrna; but this distance by sea is\r\nlittle less than 2200 stadia. The extent of the Ionian coast is reckoned\r\nfrom Poseidium,[21] belonging to the Milesians, [CAS. 632] and the\r\nboundaries of Caria, as far as Phocæa,[22] and the river Hermus.[23]\r\n\r\n3. According to Pherecydes, Miletus, Myus,[24] Mycale, and Ephesus, on\r\nthis coast, were formerly occupied by Carians; the part of the coast\r\nnext in order, as far as Phocæa, and Chios, and Samos, of which Ancæus\r\nwas king, were occupied by Leleges, but both nations were expelled by\r\nthe Ionians, and took refuge in the remaining parts of Caria.\r\n\r\nPherecydes says that the leader of the Ionian, which was posterior to\r\nthe Æolian migration, was Androclus, a legitimate son of Codrus king of\r\nthe Athenians, and that he was the founder of Ephesus, hence it was that\r\nit became the seat of the royal palace of the Ionian princes. Even at\r\npresent the descendants of that race are called kings, and receive\r\ncertain honours, as the chief seat at the public games, a purple robe as\r\na symbol of royal descent, a staff instead of a sceptre, and the\r\nsuperintendence of the sacrifices in honour of the Eleusinian Ceres.\r\n\r\nNeleus, of a Pylian family, founded Miletus. The Messenians and Pylians\r\npretend that there is some affinity between them; in reference to which\r\nlater poets say that even Nestor was a Messenian, and that many Pylians\r\naccompanied Melanthus, the father of Codrus, to Athens, and that all\r\nthis people sent out the colony in common with the Ionians. There is\r\nalso to be seen on the promontory Poseidium an altar erected by Neleus.\r\n\r\nMyus was founded by Cydrelus, a spurious son of Codrus; Lebedos[25] by\r\nAndropompus, who took possession of a place called Artis; Colophon by\r\nAndræmon, a Pylian, as Mimnermus mentions in his poem of Nanno;[26]\r\nPriene by Æpytus, son of Neleus; and afterwards by Philotas, who brought\r\na colony from Thebes; Teos by Athamas, its first founder, whence\r\nAnacreon calls the city Athamantis, but at the time of the Ionian\r\nmigration of the colony it received settlers from Nauclus, a spurious\r\nson of Codrus, and after this from Apœcus and Damasus, who were\r\nAthenians, and from Geres, a Bœotian; Erythræ was founded by Cnopus, who\r\nalso was a spurious son of Codrus; Phocæa by Athenians, who accompanied\r\nPhilogenes; Clazomenæ by Paralus; Chios by Egertius, who brought with\r\nhim a mixed body of colonists; Samos by Tembrion, and afterwards by\r\nProcles.\r\n\r\n4. These are the twelve Ionian cities. At a subsequent period Smyrna\r\nalso was added to the Ionian association at the instance of the\r\nEphesians, for anciently they inhabited the same city, at which time\r\nEphesus was called Smyrna. Callinus somewhere gives it this name, and\r\ncalls the Ephesians Smyrnæans in the address to Jupiter:\r\n\r\n   “And pity the Smyrnæans;”\r\n\r\nand in another passage,\r\n\r\n   “remember now, if ever, the beautiful thighs of the oxen\r\n   [which the Smyrnæans burnt in sacrifice].”\r\n\r\nSmyrna was an Amazon, who got possession of Ephesus; from her the\r\ninhabitants and the city had their name, in the same manner as some\r\nEphesians were called Sisyrbitæ from Sisyrba; and a certain spot in\r\nEphesus was called Smyrna, as Hipponax testifies:\r\n\r\n   “He lived in Smyrna, at the back of the city between Tracheia\r\n   and Lepre Acta.”\r\n\r\nThe mountain Prion was called Lepre Acta; it overhangs the present city,\r\nand has on it a portion of the wall. Even now the farms at the back of\r\nthe Prion retain the name in the term Opistholepria. The country along\r\nthe foot of the mountain about Coressus was called Tracheia. The city\r\nwas anciently built about the Athenæum, which is now beyond the city, at\r\nthe (fountain) Hypelæus. Smyrna therefore was situated near the present\r\ngymnasium, at the back of the present city, but between Tracheia and\r\nLepre Acta. The Smyrnæans, upon quitting the Ephesians, marched to the\r\nplace where Smyrna now stood, and which was in the possession of\r\nLeleges. They expelled these people and founded the ancient Smyrna,\r\nwhich is distant from the present city about 20 stadia. They were\r\nthemselves afterwards expelled by Æolians, and took refuge at Colophon;\r\nthey then returned with a body of men from the latter place, and\r\nrecovered their own city, Smyrna. Mimnermus relates this in his poem of\r\nNanno, and says of Smyrna, that it was always a subject of contention;\r\n\r\n   [CAS. 634] “after leaving Pylus, the lofty city of Neleus, we\r\n   came in our voyage to the long wished-for Asia, and settled at\r\n   Colophon, and hastening thence from the river Astëeis, by the\r\n   will of the gods we took Æolian Smyrna.”\r\n\r\nSo much then on this subject.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, again describe each place in particular, beginning\r\nwith the principal cities, from which the first settlements originated,\r\nI mean Miletus and Ephesus, for these are superior to all others, and\r\nthe most celebrated.\r\n\r\n5. Next after the Poseidium of the Milesians, at the distance of 18[27]\r\nstadia from the sea-coast, is the oracle of Apollo Didymeus among the\r\nBranchidæ. This, as well as the other temples, except that at Ephesus,\r\nwas burnt by the order of Xerxes.[28] The Branchidæ delivered up the\r\ntreasures of the god to the Persian king, and accompanied him in his\r\nflight, in order to avoid the punishment of sacrilege and treachery.\r\n\r\nThe Milesians afterwards built a temple, which exceeded in size all\r\nothers, but it remained without a roof on account of its magnitude. The\r\ncircuit of the sacred enclosure contained within it a village with a\r\nmagnificent grove, which also extended beyond it; other sacred\r\nenclosures contain the oracle, and what belongs to the worship of the\r\ngod.\r\n\r\nHere is laid the scene of the fable of Branchus, and Apollo’s love for\r\nhim. The temple is adorned with the most costly offerings, the\r\nproductions of ancient art.\r\n\r\nThence to the city the journey is not long either by land or sea.[29]\r\n\r\n6. Ephorus relates that Miletus was first founded and fortified by the\r\nCretans on the spot above the sea-coast where at present the ancient\r\nMiletus is situated, and that Sarpedon conducted thither settlers from\r\nthe Miletus in Crete,[30] and gave it the same name; that Leleges were\r\nthe former occupiers of the country, and that afterwards Neleus built\r\nthe present city.\r\n\r\nThe present city has four harbours, one of which will admit a fleet of\r\nships.[31] The citizens have achieved many great deeds, but the most\r\nimportant is the number of colonies which they established. The whole\r\nEuxine, for instance, and the Propontis, and many other places, are\r\npeopled with their settlers.\r\n\r\nAnaximenes of Lampsacus says, that the Milesians colonized both the\r\nisland Icarus and Lerus, and Limnæ on the Hellespont, in the\r\nChersonesus; in Asia, Abydus, Arisba, and Pæsus; on the island of the\r\nCyziceni, Artace and Cyzicus; in the interior of the Troad, Scepsis. We\r\nhave mentioned, in our particular description of places, other cities\r\nwhich this writer has omitted.\r\n\r\nBoth the Milesians and Delians invoke Apollo Ulius, as dispensing\r\nhealth and curing diseases; for οὔλειν[32] is to be in health, whence\r\nοὐλή,[33] a wound healed, and the phrase in Homer,[34] Οὖλέ τε καὶ μέγα\r\nχαῖρε, “health and good welcome;” for Apollo is a healer, and Artemis\r\nhas her name from making persons ἀρτεμέας, or sound. The sun, also, and\r\nmoon are associated with these deities, since they are the causes of\r\nthe good qualities of the air; pestilential diseases, also, and sudden\r\ndeath are attributed to these deities.\r\n\r\n7. Illustrious persons, natives of Miletus, were Thales, one of the\r\nseven wise men, the first person who introduced among the Greeks\r\nphysiology and mathematics; his disciple Anaximander, and Anaximenes the\r\ndisciple of Anaximander. Besides these, Hecatæus the historian;[35] and\r\nof our time, Æschines the orator, who was banished for having spoken\r\nwith too great freedom before Pompey the Great, and died in exile.\r\n\r\nMiletus shut her gates against Alexander, and experienced the misfortune\r\nof being taken by storm, which was also the fate of Halicarnassus; long\r\nbefore this time it was captured by the Persians. Callisthenes relates,\r\nthat Phrynichus the tragic writer was fined a thousand drachmæ by the\r\nAthenians for composing a play entitled “The taking of Miletus by\r\nDarius.” [CAS. 635] The island Lade lies close in front of Miletus, and\r\nsmall islands about Tragææ,[36] which afford a shelter for pirates.\r\n\r\n8. Next follows the Gulf of Latmus, on which is situated “Heracleia\r\nunder Latmus,”[37] as it is called, a small town with a shelter for\r\nvessels. It formerly had the same name as the mountain above, which\r\nHecatæus thinks was the same as that called by the poet[38] the mountain\r\nof the Phtheiri, for he says that the mountain of the Phtheiri was\r\nsituated below Latmus; but some say that it was Grium, as being parallel\r\nto Latmus, and extending from the Milesian territory towards the east,\r\nthrough Caria, as far as Euromus and Chalcetores. However, the mountain\r\nrises up in sight of[39] the city.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance further, after crossing a small river near Latmus,\r\nthere is seen in a cave the sepulchre of Endymion. Then from Heracleia\r\nto Pyrrha, a small city, is about 100 stadia by sea, but a little more\r\nfrom Miletus to Heracleia, if we include the winding of the bays.\r\n\r\n9. From Miletus to Pyrrha, in a straight line by sea, is 30 stadia; so\r\nmuch longer is the journey by sailing near the land.\r\n\r\n10. When we are speaking of celebrated places, the reader must endure\r\nwith patience the dryness of such geographical descriptions.\r\n\r\nFrom Pyrrha to the mouth of the Mæander are 50 stadia. The ground about\r\nit is marshy and a swamp. In sailing up the river in vessels rowed by\r\noars to the distance of 30 stadia, we come to Myus,[40] one of the\r\ntwelve Ionian cities, which, on account of its diminished population, is\r\nnow incorporated with Miletus. Xerxes is said to have given this city to\r\nThemistocles to supply him with fish, Magnesia with bread, and Lampsacus\r\nwith wine.[41]\r\n\r\n11. At four stadia from Myus is Thymbria, a Carian village, near which\r\nis Aornum; this is a sacred cave called Charonium, which emits\r\ndestructive vapours. Above it is Magnesia[42] on the Mæander, a colony\r\nof the Magnesians of Thessaly and Crete. We shall speak of it very soon.\r\n\r\n12. After the mouths of the Mæander follows the shore of Priene. Above\r\nit is Priene,[43] and the mountain Mycale,[44] which abounds with\r\nanimals of the chace, and is covered with forests. It is situated above\r\nthe Samian territory, and forms towards it, beyond the promontory\r\nTrogilium,[45] a strait of above 7 stadia in width. Priene is called by\r\nsome writers Cadme, because Philotus, its second founder, was a Bœotian.\r\nBias, one of the seven wise men, was a native of Priene, of whom\r\nHipponax uses this expression;\r\n\r\n   “More just in pleadings than Bias of Priene.”\r\n\r\n13. In front of Trogilium lies an island of the same name. Thence, which\r\nis the nearest way, is a passage across to Sunium of 1600 stadia. At the\r\ncommencement of the voyage, on the right hand are Samos, Icaria, and the\r\nCorsiæ islands;[46] on the left, the Melantian rocks.[47] The remainder\r\nof the voyage lies through the middle of the Cyclades islands. The\r\npromontory Trogilium itself may be considered as a foot of the mountain\r\nMycale. Close to Mycale is another mountain, the Pactyas, belonging to\r\nthe Ephesian territory, where the Mesogis terminates.\r\n\r\n14. From Trogilium to Samos are 40 stadia. Both this and the harbour,\r\nwhich has a station for vessels, have a southern aspect. A great part of\r\nit is situated on a flat, and is overflowed by the sea, but a part also\r\nrises towards the mountain which overhangs it. On the right hand, in\r\nsailing towards the city, is the Poseidium, a promontory, which forms\r\ntowards Mycale the strait of 7 stadia. It has upon it a temple of\r\nNeptune. In front is a small island, Narthecis; on the left, near the\r\nHeræum, is the suburb, and the river Imbrasus, and the Heræum, an\r\nancient temple, and a large nave, which at present is a repository for\r\npaintings. Besides the great number of paintings in the Heræum, there\r\nare other repositories and some small chapels, filled with works of\r\nancient art. The Hypæthrum also is full of the best statues. Of these,\r\nthree of colossal size, the work of Myron, stand [CAS. 637] upon the\r\nsame base. Antony took them all away, but Augustus Cæsar replaced two,\r\nthe Minerva and the Hercules, upon the same base. He transported the\r\nJupiter to the Capitol, having built a chapel for its reception.\r\n\r\n15. The voyage round the island Samos is 600 stadia.[48] Formerly, when\r\nthe Carians inhabited it, it was called Parthenia, then Anthemus, then\r\nMelamphylus,[49] then Samos, either from the name of some native hero,\r\nor from some one who conducted a colony thither from Ithaca and\r\nCephallenia. In it is a promontory looking towards Drepanum in Icaria,\r\nwhich has the name of Ampelos, (the Vine,) but the whole mountain, which\r\nspreads over the island, has the same name. The island is not remarkable\r\nfor good wine,[50] although the islands around, as Chios, Lesbos, Cos,\r\nand almost all the adjacent continent, produce wines of the best kind.\r\nThe Ephesian and the Metropolites are good wines, but the Mesogis, the\r\nTmolus, the Catacecaumene, Cnidos, Smyrna, and other more obscure\r\nplaces, are distinguished for the excellence of their wines, whether for\r\ngratification or dietetic purposes.\r\n\r\nSamos is not very fortunate as regards the production of wine, but in\r\ngeneral it is fertile, as appears from its possession being a subject of\r\nwarlike contention, and from the language of its panegyrists, who do not\r\nhesitate to apply to it the proverb,\r\n\r\n   “It produces even birds’ milk,”\r\n\r\nas Menander somewhere says. This was the cause also of the tyrannies\r\nestablished there, and of the enmity of the Athenians.\r\n\r\n16. The tyrannies were at their height in the time of Polycrates and his\r\nbrother Syloson. The former was distinguished for his good fortune, and\r\nthe possession of such a degree of power as made him master of the sea.\r\nIt is related as an instance of his good fortune, that having purposely\r\nthrown into the sea his ring, which was of great value both on account\r\nof the stone and the engraving, a short time afterwards a fisherman\r\ncaught the fish which had swallowed it, and on cutting the fish open,\r\nthe ring was discovered. When the king of Egypt was informed of this, he\r\ndeclared, it is said, with a prophetic spirit, that Polycrates, who had\r\nbeen elevated to such a height of prosperity, would soon end his life\r\nunfortunately; and this was actually the case, for he was taken by the\r\nPersian satrap by stratagem, and crucified. Anacreon, the lyric poet,\r\nwas his contemporary, and all his poetry abounds with the praises of\r\nPolycrates.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in his time Pythagoras, observing the growing tyranny,\r\nleft the city, and travelled to Egypt and Babylon, with a view to\r\nacquire knowledge. On his return from his travels, perceiving that the\r\ntyranny still prevailed, he set sail for Italy, and there passed the\r\nremainder of his life.\r\n\r\nSo much respecting Polycrates.\r\n\r\n17. Syloson was left by his brother in a private station. But he made a\r\npresent to Darius, son of Hystaspes, of a robe which the latter saw him\r\nwearing, and very much desired to possess. Darius was not king at this\r\ntime, but when he became king, Polycrates received as a compensation the\r\ntyranny of Samos. He governed with so much severity, that the city was\r\ndepopulated, which gave occasion to the proverb,\r\n\r\n   “By the pleasure of Syloson there is room enough.”\r\n\r\n18. The Athenians formerly sent Pericles their general, and with him\r\nSophocles the poet, who harassed with the evils of a siege the\r\nrefractory Samians. Afterwards[51] they sent thither a colony of two\r\nthousand citizens, among whom was Neocles the father of Epicurus, and,\r\naccording to report, a school-master. It is said, that Epicurus was\r\neducated here and at Teos, and was admitted among the ephebi at Athens,\r\nhaving as his comrade in that class Menander the comic poet. Creophylus\r\nwas a native of Samos,[52] who, it is said, once entertained Homer as\r\nhis guest, and received, in return, his poem entitled “The taking of\r\nŒchalia.” Callimachus, on the contrary, intimates in an epigram that it\r\nwas the composition of [CAS. 639] Creophylus, but ascribed to Homer on\r\naccount of the story of his hospitable entertainment by Creophylus:\r\n\r\n   “I am the work of the Samian, who once entertained in his\r\n   house, as a guest, the divine Homer. I grieve for the\r\n   sufferings of Eurytus, and mourn for the yellow-haired Ioleia.\r\n   I am called Homer’s writing. O Jupiter, how glorious this for\r\n   Creophylus.”\r\n\r\nSome say that he was Homer’s master; according to others, it was not\r\nCreophylus, but Aristeas of Proconnesus.\r\n\r\n19. The island of Icaria, from which the Icarian Sea has its name, is\r\nnear Samos. The island has its name from Icarus, the son of Dædalus,\r\nwho, it is said, having accompanied his father in his flight, when both\r\nof them, furnished with wings, set out from Crete, fell on that island,\r\nunable to sustain his flight. He had mounted too near the sun, and the\r\nwings dropped off on the melting of the wax [with which they were\r\nfastened].\r\n\r\nThe whole island is 300 stadia in circumference; it has no harbours, but\r\nonly anchorages, the best of which is called Histi. A promontory\r\nstretches towards the west. There is also on the island a temple of\r\nDiana, called Tauropolium, and a small town Œnoë; and another,\r\nDracanum,[53] of the same name as the promontory on which it stands,\r\nwith an anchorage for vessels. The promontory is distant from the\r\npromontory of the Samians, called Cantharius, 80 stadia, which is the\r\nshortest passage from one to the other. The Samians occupy it at present\r\nin its depopulated state, chiefly for the sake of pasture which it\r\naffords for cattle.\r\n\r\n20. Next to the Samian strait at Mycale, on the right hand on the voyage\r\nto Ephesus, is the sea-coast of the Ephesians, a part of which even the\r\nSamians possess. First on the sea-coast is the Panionium,[54] distant\r\nfrom the sea three stadia, where the Panionia, a common festival of the\r\nIonians, is celebrated, and a sacrifice is performed in honour of the\r\nHeliconian Neptune. The priests are Prienians. We have spoken of them in\r\nthe description of Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\nThen follows Neapolis, which formerly belonged to the Ephesians, but now\r\nbelongs to the Samians, having exchanged Marathesium[55] for it, the\r\nmore distant for the nearer place. Next is Pygela, a small town,\r\ncontaining a temple of Diana Munychia. It was founded by Agamemnon, and\r\ncolonized by some of his soldiers, who had a disease in the buttocks,\r\nand were called Pygalgeis; as they laboured under this complaint, they\r\nsettled there, and the town had the appropriate name of Pygela.[56]\r\n\r\nNext is a harbour called Panormus, with a temple of the Ephesian Diana;\r\nthen the city.\r\n\r\nOn the same coast, at a little distance from the sea, is Ortygia, a fine\r\nwood with trees of all kinds, but the cypress in the greatest abundance.\r\nThrough this wood flows the river Cenchrius, in which Latona is said to\r\nhave bathed after the birth of her child. For here is laid the scene of\r\nthe birth of the child, the cares of the nurse Ortygia, the cave in\r\nwhich the birth took place, the neighbouring olive tree under which the\r\ngoddess first reposed when the pains of childbirth had ceased.\r\n\r\nAbove the wood is the mountain Solmissus, where, it is said, the Curetes\r\nstationed themselves, and with the noise of their arms perplexed and\r\nterrified Juno, who was enviously watching in secret the delivery of\r\nLatona, who was thus assisted in concealing the birth of the child.\r\n\r\nThere are many temples in the place, some of which are ancient, others\r\nof later times; in the former are ancient statues; in the latter are\r\nworks of Scopas, Latona holding a sceptre, and Ortygia standing by her\r\nwith a child in each arm.\r\n\r\nA convention and festival are celebrated there every year. It is the\r\ncustom for young men to vie with each other, particularly in the\r\nsplendour of their convivial entertainments. The body of Curetes\r\ncelebrate their Symposia at the same time, and perform certain mystic\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\n21. The city of Ephesus was inhabited both by Carians and Leleges. After\r\nAndroclus had expelled the greatest part of the inhabitants, he settled\r\nhis companions about the Athenæum, and the Hypelæum, and in the\r\nmountainous tract at the foot of the Coressus. It was thus inhabited\r\ntill the time of Crœsus. Afterwards, the inhabitants descended from the\r\nmountainous district, and settled about the present temple, and\r\ncontinued there to the time of Alexander. Then Lysimachus built a wall\r\nround the present temple, and, perceiving the inhabitants [CAS. 640]\r\nunwilling to remove thither, took advantage of a heavy storm of rain\r\nwhich he saw approaching, and obstructed the drains so as to inundate\r\nthe city, and the inhabitants were glad to leave it for another place.\r\n\r\nHe called the city Arsinoë, after the name of his wife, but the old name\r\nprevailed. A body of elders was enrolled, with whom were associated\r\npersons called Epicleti, who administered all the affairs of the city.\r\n\r\n22. Chersiphron[57] was the first architect of the temple of Diana;\r\nanother afterwards enlarged it, but when Herostratus set fire to it,[58]\r\nthe citizens constructed one more magnificent. They collected for this\r\npurpose the ornaments of the women, contributions from private property,\r\nand the money arising from the sale of pillars of the former temple.\r\nEvidence of these things is to be found in the decrees of that time.\r\nArtemidorus says, that Timæus of Tauromenium, in consequence of his\r\nignorance of these decrees, and being otherwise a calumniator and\r\ndetractor, (whence he had the name of Epitimæus, or Reviler,) avers that\r\nthe Ephesians restored the temple by means of the treasure deposited\r\nthere by the Persians. But at that time no treasure was deposited, and\r\nif any had been deposited there, it must have been consumed together\r\nwith the temple: after the conflagration, when the roof was destroyed,\r\nwho would wish to have a deposit lying there, with the sacred enclosure\r\nexposed to the air?\r\n\r\nBesides, Artemidorus says, that Alexander promised to defray the expense\r\nof its restoration, both what had been and what would be incurred, on\r\ncondition that the work should be attributed to him in the inscription,\r\nbut the Ephesians refused to accede to this; much less, then, would they\r\nbe disposed to acquire fame by sacrilege and spoliation. He praises also\r\nthe reply of an Ephesian to the king, “that it was not fit that a god\r\nshould provide temples in honour of gods.”\r\n\r\n23. After the completion of the temple, which, he says, was the work of\r\nCheirocrates (the same person who built Alexandria, and also promised\r\nAlexander that he would form Mount Athos into a statue of him, which\r\nshould represent him as pouring a libation into a dish out of an ewer;\r\nthat he would build two cities, one on the right hand of the mountain,\r\nand another on the left, and a river should flow out of the dish from\r\none to the other,)[59]—after the completion of the temple, he says that\r\nthe multitude of other sacred offerings were purchased by the Ephesians,\r\nat the value set on them by artificers, and that the altar was almost\r\nentirely full of the works of Praxiteles. They showed us also some of\r\nthe performances of Thraso, namely, the Hecatesium, a Penelope,[60] and\r\nthe old woman Eurycleia.\r\n\r\nThe priests were eunuchs, who were called Megabyzi. It was the practice\r\nto send to various places for persons worthy of this office, and they\r\nwere held in high honour. They were obliged to appoint virgins as their\r\ncolleagues in their priesthood. At present some of their rites and\r\ncustoms are observed, and some are neglected.\r\n\r\nThe temple was formerly, and is at present, a place of refuge, but the\r\nlimits of the sanctity of this asylum have been frequently altered;\r\nAlexander extended them to the distance of a stadium. Mithridates\r\ndischarged an arrow from the angle of the roof, and supposed that it\r\nfell a little beyond the distance of a stadium. Antonius doubled this\r\ndistance, and included within the range of the sanctuary a certain\r\nportion of the city. This was attended with much evil, as it placed the\r\ncity in the power of criminals and malefactors. On this account Augustus\r\nCæsar abolished the privilege.\r\n\r\n24. The city has an arsenal and a harbour. The entrance of the harbour\r\nwas made narrow, by order of the king Attalus Philadelphus, who,\r\ntogether with the persons that constructed it, was disappointed at the\r\nresult. The harbour was formerly shallow, on account of the embankment\r\nof earth accumulated by the Caÿster; but the king, supposing that there\r\nwould be [CAS. 641] deep water for the entrance of large vessels of\r\nburden, if a mole were thrown up before the mouth of the river, which\r\nwas very wide, gave orders for the construction of a mole; but the\r\ncontrary effect took place, for the mud, being confined within the\r\nharbour, made the whole of it shallow to the mouth. Before the\r\nconstruction of the mole, the flow and ebb of the sea cleared the mud\r\naway entirely, by forcing it outwards.\r\n\r\nSuch then is the nature of the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe city, by the advantages which it affords, daily improves, and is the\r\nlargest mart in Asia within the Taurus.\r\n\r\n25. Among illustrious persons in ancient times natives of Ephesus were\r\nHeracleitus, surnamed Scoteinus, or the Obscure, and Hermodorus, of whom\r\nHeracleitus himself says:\r\n\r\n   “The Ephesians, youths and all, deserve hanging, for expelling\r\n   Hermodorus, an honest citizen,[61] a citizen distinguished for\r\n   his virtues, and saying, let there be no such amongst us; if\r\n   there be, let it be in another place and among other people.”\r\n\r\nHermodorus seems to have compiled laws for the Romans. Hipponax the poet\r\nwas an Ephesian, and the painters Parrhasius and Apelles.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times was Alexander the orator, surnamed Lychnus, or the\r\nLamp;[62] he was an administrator of state affairs, a writer of history,\r\nand left behind him poems which contain a description of the heavenly\r\nphenomena and a geographical account of the continents, each of which\r\nforms the subject of a distinct poem.\r\n\r\n26. Next to the mouth of the Caÿster is a lake called Selinusia, formed\r\nby the overflowing of the sea. It is succeeded by another, which\r\ncommunicates with this. They afford a large revenue, of which the kings,\r\nalthough it was sacred, deprived the goddess, but the Romans restored\r\nit; then the tax-gatherers seized upon the tribute by force, and\r\nconverted it to their own use. Artemidorus, who was sent on an embassy\r\nto Rome, as he says, recovered possession of the lakes for the goddess,\r\nand also of the territory of Heracleotis, which was on the point of\r\nseparating from Ephesus, by proceeding in a suit at Rome. In return for\r\nthese services, the city erected in the temple to his honour a statue of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nIn the most retired part of the lake is a temple of a king, built, it is\r\nsaid, by Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n27. Next follows the mountain Gallesius, and Colophon, an Ionian city,\r\nin front of which is the grove of Apollo Clarius, where was once an\r\nancient oracle.[63] It is said that the prophet Calchas came hither on\r\nfoot, on his return from Troy with Amphilochus, the son of Amphiaraus,\r\nand that meeting at Clarus with a prophet superior to himself, Mopsus,\r\nthe son of Mantus, the daughter of Teiresias, he died of vexation.\r\n\r\nHesiod relates the fable somewhat in this manner: Calchas propounds to\r\nMopsus something of this kind:\r\n\r\n   “I am surprised to see how large a quantity of figs there is\r\n   on this small tree; can you tell the number?”\r\n\r\nMopsus answered:\r\n\r\n   “There are ten thousand; they will measure a medimnus, and\r\n   there is one over, which you cannot comprehend.”\r\n\r\nThus he spoke; the number and measure were exact. Then Calchas closed\r\nhis eyes in the sleep of death.\r\n\r\nBut Pherecydes says, that Calchas proposed a question respecting a\r\npregnant sow, and asked how many young she had; the other answered,\r\n“three, one of which is a sow.” Upon his giving the true answer, Calchas\r\ndied of vexation. According to others, Calchas propounded the question\r\nof the sow, and Mopsus that of the fig-tree; that Mopsus returned the\r\ntrue answer, and that Calchas was mistaken, who died of vexation,\r\naccording to some oracular prophecy.\r\n\r\nSophocles, in his “Helen Claimed,” says that he was destined by fate to\r\ndie when he should meet with a prophet superior to himself. But this\r\nwriter transfers the scene of the rivalry, and of the death of Calchas,\r\nto Cilicia.\r\n\r\nThese are ancient traditions.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 643] 28. The Colophonians once possessed a considerable armament,\r\nconsisting both of ships and of cavalry. In the latter they were so much\r\nsuperior to other nations, that in any obstinate engagement, on\r\nwhichever side the Colophonian horse were auxiliaries, they decided it;\r\nwhence came the proverb, “he put the Colophon to it,” when a person\r\nbrought any affair to a decisive issue.[64]\r\n\r\nAmong some of the remarkable persons born at Colophon were Mimnermus, a\r\nflute-player and an elegiac poet; Xenophanes, the natural philosopher,\r\nwho composed Silli in verse. Pindar mentions one Polymnastus also, a\r\nColophonian, as distinguished for his skill in music:\r\n\r\n   “Thou knowest the celebrated strains of Polymnastus, the\r\n   Colophonian:”\r\n\r\nand some writers affirm that Homer was of that city. The voyage from\r\nEphesus in a straight line is 70 stadia, and including the winding of\r\nthe bays, 120.\r\n\r\n29. Next to Colophon is the mountain Coracium, and a small island sacred\r\nto Artemis, to which it is believed that the hinds swim across to bring\r\nforth their young.\r\n\r\nThen follows Lebedos,[65] distant from Colophon 120 stadia. This is the\r\nplace of meeting and residence[66] of the Dionysiac artists (who travel\r\nabout) Ionia as far as the Hellespont. In Ionia a general assembly is\r\nheld, and games are celebrated every year in honour of Bacchus. These\r\nartists formerly inhabited Teos,[67] a city of the Ionians, next in\r\norder after Colophon, but on the breaking out of a sedition they took\r\nrefuge at Ephesus; and when Attalus settled them at Myonnesus,[68]\r\nbetween Teos and Lebedos, the Teians sent a deputation to request the\r\nRomans not to permit Myonnesus to be fortified, as it would endanger\r\ntheir safety. They migrated to Lebedos, and the Lebedians were glad to\r\nreceive them, on account of their own scanty population.\r\n\r\nTeos is distant from Lebedos 120 stadia. Between these two places is the\r\nisland Aspis,[69] which some writers call Arconnesus. Myonnesus\r\nis situated upon high ground resembling a peninsula.\r\n\r\n30. Teos is situated upon a peninsula, and has a port. Anacreon, the\r\nlyric poet, was a native of this place; in his time, the Teians, unable\r\nto endure the insults and injuries of the Persians, abandoned Teos, and\r\nremoved to Abdera, whence originated the verse—\r\n\r\n   “Abdera, the beautiful colony of the Teians.”\r\n\r\nSome of them returned in after-times to their own country. We have said\r\nthat Apellicon was of Teos, and Hecatæus also, the historian.\r\n\r\nThere is another port to the north, at the distance of 30 stadia from\r\nthe city, Gerrhæïdæ.[70]\r\n\r\n31. Next follows Chalcideis, and the isthmus of the peninsula[71] of the\r\nTeians and Erythræans; the latter inhabit the interior of the isthmus.\r\nThe Teians and Clazomenians are situated on the isthmus itself. The\r\nTeians occupy the southern side of the isthmus, namely, Chalcideis;[72]\r\nthe Clazomenians, the northern side, whence they are contiguous to the\r\nErythræan district. At the commencement of the isthmus is Hypocremnus,\r\nhaving on this side the Erythræan, and on the other, the Clazomenian\r\nterritory. Above Chalcideis is a grove, dedicated to Alexander, the son\r\nof Philip, and a festival called Alexandreia is proclaimed and\r\ncelebrated there by the common body of the Ionians.\r\n\r\nThe passage across the isthmus from the Alexandrine grove and\r\nChalcideis, as far as the Hypocremnus, is 50 stadia (150?). The circuit\r\nround by sea is more than 1000 stadia. Somewhere about the middle of the\r\nvoyage is Erythræ,[73] an Ionian city, with a port, having in front four\r\nsmall islands, called Hippoi (the Horses).\r\n\r\n32. But before we come to Erythræ, the first place we meet with is\r\nEræ,[74] a small city belonging to the Teians.\r\n\r\nNext is Corycus, a lofty mountain; and below it, Casystes, a port;[75]\r\nthen another, called the port of Erythræ, and afterwards many others.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 644] It is said that the whole sea-coast along the Corycus was\r\nthe haunt of pirates, who were called Corycæans, and who had contrived a\r\nnew mode of attacking vessels. They dispersed themselves among the\r\nports, and went among the merchants who had just arrived, and listened\r\nto their conversation respecting the freight of their ships, and the\r\nplaces whither they were bound. The pirates then collected together,\r\nattacked the merchants at sea, and plundered the vessels. Hence all\r\ninquisitive persons and those who listen to private and secret\r\nconversation we call Corycæans, and say proverbially,\r\n\r\n   “The Corycæan must have overheard it,”\r\n\r\nwhen any one thinks that he has done or said anything not to be\r\ndivulged, but is betrayed by spies or persons anxious to be informed of\r\nwhat does not concern them.\r\n\r\n33. Next to Corycus is Halonnesus, a small island, then the\r\nArgennum,[76] a promontory of the Erythræan territory, situated close to\r\nPoseidium, belonging to the Chians, and forming a strait of about 60\r\nstadia in width. Between Erythræ and Hypocremnus is Mimas,[77] a lofty\r\nmountain, abounding with beasts of chase, and well wooded. Then follows\r\nCybelia, a village, and a promontory called Melæna,[78] (or Black,)\r\nwhich has a quarry whence millstones are obtained.\r\n\r\n34. Erythræ was the native place of the Sibyl, an ancient inspired\r\nprophetess. In the time of Alexander there was another Sibyl, who was\r\nalso a prophetess, whose name was Athenais, a native of the same city;\r\nand in our age there was Heracleides the Herophilian physician, a native\r\nof Erythræ, a fellow-student of Apollonius surnamed Mus.\r\n\r\n35. The coasting circumnavigation of Chios is 900 stadia. It has a\r\ncity[79] with a good port, and a station for eighty vessels. In the\r\nvoyage round the island, a person sailing from the city, with the island\r\non his right hand, first meets with Poseidium,[80] then Phanæ,[81] a\r\ndeep harbour, and a temple of Apollo, and a grove of palm trees; then\r\nNotium, a part of the coast affording a shelter for vessels; next\r\nLaïus,[82] which is also a place of shelter for vessels; hence to the\r\ncity is an isthmus of 60 stadia. The circumnavigation is 360 stadia, as\r\nI have before described it. Next, the promontory Melæna,[83] opposite to\r\nwhich is Psyra,[84] an island distant from the promontory 50 stadia,\r\nlofty, with a city of the same name. The island is 40 stadia in\r\ncircumference. Next is the rugged tract, Ariusia, without harbours,\r\nabout 30 stadia in extent. It produces the best of the Grecian wines.\r\nThen follows Pelinæum,[85] the highest mountain in the island. In the\r\nisland is a marble quarry.\r\n\r\nAmong illustrious natives of Chios were Ion[86] the tragic writer,\r\nTheopompus the historian, and Theocritus the sophist. The two latter\r\npersons were opposed to each other in the political parties in the\r\nstate. The Chians claim Homer as a native of their country, alleging as\r\na proof the Homeridæ, as they are called, descendants from his family,\r\nwhom Pindar mentions:\r\n\r\n   “Whence also the Homeridæ, the chanters of the rhapsodies,\r\n   most frequently begin their song.”[87]\r\n\r\nThe Chians once possessed a naval force, and aspired to the sovereignty\r\nof the sea, and to liberty.[88]\r\n\r\nFrom Chios to Lesbos is a voyage of about 400 stadia, with a south wind.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 645] 36. After the Hypocremnus is Chytrium, a place where\r\nClazomenæ[89] formerly stood; then the present city, having in front\r\neight small islands, the land of which is cultivated by husbandmen.\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras, the natural philosopher, was a distinguished Clazomenian; he\r\nwas a disciple of Anaximenes the Milesian, and master of Archelaus the\r\nnatural philosopher, and of Euripides the poet.\r\n\r\nNext is a temple of Apollo, and hot springs, the bay of Smyrna, and the\r\ncity Smyrna.\r\n\r\n37. Next is another bay, on which is situated the ancient Smyrna, at the\r\ndistance of 20 stadia from the present city. After Smyrna had been razed\r\nby the Lydians, the inhabitants continued for about four hundred years\r\nto live in villages. It was then restored by Antigonus, and afterwards\r\nby Lysimachus, and at present it is the most beautiful city in Ionia.\r\n\r\nOne portion of Smyrna is built up on a hill, but the greater part is in\r\nthe plain near the harbour, the Metroum, and the Gymnasium. The division\r\nof the streets is excellent, and as nearly as possible in straight\r\nlines. There are paved roads, large quadrangular porticos, both on a\r\nlevel with the ground and with an upper story.\r\n\r\nThere is also a library, and the Homereium, a quadrangular portico,\r\nwhich has a temple of Homer and a statue. For the Smyrnæans, above all\r\nothers, urge the claims of their city to be the birth-place of Homer,\r\nand they have a sort of brass money, called Homereium.[90]\r\n\r\nThe river Meles flows near the walls. Besides other conveniences with\r\nwhich the city is furnished, there is a close harbour.\r\n\r\nThere is one, and not a trifling, defect in the work of the architects,\r\nthat when they paved the roads, they did not make drains beneath them;\r\nthe filth consequently lies on the surface, and, during rains\r\nparticularly, the receptacles of the filth spread it over the streets.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Dolabella besieged and slew Trebonius, one of the\r\nmurderers of divus Cæsar; he also destroyed many parts of the city.\r\n\r\n38. Next to Smyrna is Leucæ,[91] a small city, which Aristonicus caused\r\nto revolt, after the death of Attalus, the son of Philometor,[92] under\r\npretence of being descended from the royal family, but with the\r\nintention of usurping the kingdom. He was, however, defeated in a naval\r\nengagement by the Ephesians, near the Cumæan district, and expelled. But\r\nhe went into the interior of the country, and quickly collected together\r\na multitude of needy people and slaves, who were induced to follow him\r\nby the hope of obtaining their freedom, whom he called Heliopolitæ. He\r\nfirst surprised Thyateira,[93] he then got possession of Apollonis, and\r\nhad an intention of making himself master of other fortresses, but he\r\ndid not maintain his ground long. The cities sent immediately a large\r\nbody of troops against him, and were supported by Nicomedes the\r\nBithynian and the kings of Cappadocia. Afterwards five deputies of the\r\nRomans came, then an army, and the consul Publius Crassus. These were\r\nfollowed by M. Perperna, who took Aristonicus prisoner, sent him to\r\nRome, and thus put an end to the war. Aristonicus died in prison;\r\nPerperna died of some disease, and Crassus fell near Leucæ, in a\r\nskirmish with some people who had attacked him from an ambuscade. Manius\r\nAquillius the consul came afterwards, with ten lieutenants; he regulated\r\nthe affairs of the province, and established that form of government\r\nwhich continues at present.\r\n\r\nAfter Leucæ follows Phocæa,[94] situated on a bay. I have mentioned this\r\nplace in the description of Massalia.[95] Then follow the confines of\r\nthe Ionians and the Æolians. I have already spoken of these.[96]\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the Ionian maritime territory there remain to be\r\ndescribed the places about the road leading from Ephesus, as far as\r\nAntioch[97] and the Mæander.\r\n\r\nThis tract is occupied by a mixed population of Lydians, Carians, and\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\n39. The first place after Ephesus is Magnesia, an Æolian city, and\r\ncalled Magnesia on the Mæander, for it is situated near it; but it is\r\nstill nearer the Lethæus, which discharges itself into the Mæander. It\r\nhas its source in Pactyes, a mountain in the Ephesian district. There is\r\nanother Lethæus in [CAS. 647] Gortyne, a third near Tricca, where\r\nAsclepius is said to have been born, and the fourth among the Hesperitæ\r\nLibyans.[98]\r\n\r\nMagnesia lies in a plain, near a mountain called Thorax,[99] on which it\r\nis said Daphitas the grammarian was crucified, for reviling the kings in\r\na distich—\r\n\r\n   “O slaves, with backs purpled with stripes, filings of the\r\n   gold of Lysimachus, you are the kings of Lydia and Phrygia.”\r\n\r\nAn oracle is said to have warned Daphitas to beware of the Thorax.[100]\r\n\r\n40. The Magnesians appear to be the descendants of Delphians who\r\ninhabited the Didymæan mountains in Thessaly, and of whom Hesiod says,\r\n\r\n   “or, as the chaste virgin, who inhabits the sacred Didymæan\r\n   hills in the plain of Dotium, opposite Amyrus, abounding with\r\n   vines, and bathes her feet in the lake Bœbias—”\r\n\r\nAt Magnesia also was the temple of Dindymene, the mother of the gods.\r\nHer priestess, according to some writers, was the daughter, according to\r\nothers, the wife, of Themistocles. At present there is no temple,\r\nbecause the city has been transferred to another place. In the present\r\ncity is the temple of Artemis Leucophryene, which in the size of the\r\nnave and in the number of sacred offerings is inferior to the temple at\r\nEphesus; but, in the fine proportion and the skill exhibited in the\r\nstructure of the enclosure, it greatly surpasses the Ephesian temple; in\r\nsize it is superior to all the temples in Asia, except that at Ephesus\r\nand that at Didymi.\r\n\r\nAnciently the Magnetes were utterly extirpated by Treres, a Cimmerian\r\ntribe, who for a long period made successful inroads. Subsequently\r\nEphesians got possession of the place.[101] Callinus speaks of the\r\nMagnetes as still in a flourishing state, and successful in the war\r\nagainst the Ephesians. But Archilochus seems to have been acquainted\r\nwith the calamities which had befallen them:\r\n\r\n   “bewail the misfortunes of the Thasians, not of the Magnetes;”\r\n\r\nwhence we may conjecture that Archilochus was posterior to Callinus. Yet\r\nCallinus mentions some other earlier inroad of the Cimmerians, when he\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n   “and now the army of the daring Cimmerians is advancing,”\r\n\r\nwhere he is speaking of the capture of Sardis.\r\n\r\n41. Among the illustrious natives of Magnesia were Hegesias the orator,\r\nwho first introduced the Asiatic fervour, as it was called, and\r\ncorrupted the established Attic style of eloquence; Simon (Simus?) the\r\nlyric poet, who also corrupted the system and plan of former lyric\r\npoets, by introducing the Simodia; it was still more corrupted by the\r\nLysiodi and Magodi;[102] Cleomachus the pugilist, who was enamoured of a\r\ncertain cinædus, and a female servant, who was maintained by the\r\ncinædus, imitated the sort of dialect and the manners of the cinædi.\r\nSotades was the first person that employed the language of the cinædi,\r\nand he was followed by Alexander the Ætolian; but these were only prose\r\nwriters. Lysis added verse, but this had been done before his time by\r\nSimus.\r\n\r\nThe theatres had raised the reputation of Anaxenor, the player on the\r\ncithara, but Antony elevated him as high as possible, by appointing him\r\nreceiver of the tribute from four cities, and by giving him a guard of\r\nsoldiers for the protection of his person. His native country also\r\naugmented his dignity, by investing him with the sacred purple of\r\nJupiter Sosipolis, as is represented in the painted figure in the forum.\r\nThere is also in the theatre a figure in brass, with this inscription:\r\n\r\n   [CAS. 648] “It is truly delightful to listen to a minstrel\r\n   such as he is, whose voice is like that of the gods.”[103]\r\n\r\nThe artist who engraved the words was inattentive to the space which\r\nthey would occupy, and omitted the last letter of the second verse,\r\nΑΥΔΗΙ, (voice,) the breadth of the base not being large\r\nenough to allow its insertion; this afforded an occasion of accusing the\r\ncitizens of ignorance, on account of the ambiguity of the inscription;\r\nfor it is not clear whether the nominative ΑΥΔΗ, or the\r\ndative ΑΥΔΗΙ, is to be understood, for many persons write\r\nthe dative cases without the Ι, and reject the usage, as not\r\nfounded on any natural reason.\r\n\r\n42. After Magnesia is the road to Tralles;[104] travellers have on the\r\nleft hand Mesogis,[105] and on the right hand, and from the road itself,\r\nthe plain of the Mæander, which is occupied in common by Lydians,\r\nCarians, Ionians, Milesians, Mysians, and the Æolians of Magnesia.\r\n\r\nThe character of the sites of places is the same even as far as\r\nNysa[106] and Antioch.\r\n\r\nThe city of Tralles is built upon ground in the shape somewhat of a\r\ntrapezium. It has a citadel strongly fortified, and the places around\r\nare well defended. It is as well peopled as any of the cities in Asia,\r\nand its inhabitants are wealthy; some of them constantly occupy chief\r\nstations in the province, and are called Asiarchs. Among the latter was\r\nPythodorus, originally a native of Nysa; but, induced by the celebrity\r\nof the place, he migrated hither. He was one of the few friends of\r\nPompey who were fortunate. His wealth was kingly, and consisted of more\r\nthan two thousand talents, which he redeemed when it was confiscated by\r\ndivus Cæsar, on account of his attachment to Pompey, and left it\r\nundiminished to his children. Pythodoris, who is at present queen in\r\nPontus, and whom we have mentioned before, is his daughter. Pythodorus\r\nflourished in our times, and also Menodorus, an eloquent man, and a\r\nperson of dignified and grave demeanour; he was priest of Jupiter\r\nLarisæus. He was circumvented by the adherents of Domitius Ænobarbus,\r\nwho, on the credit of informers, put him to death, for attempting, as\r\nwas supposed, the revolt of his fleet.\r\n\r\nTralles produced also celebrated orators, Dionysocles, and after him\r\nDamasus, surnamed Scombrus.\r\n\r\nIt is said to have been founded by Argives and a body of Tralli\r\nThracians,[107] from whom it had its name. It was governed for a short\r\ntime by tyrants, sons of Cratippus, about the period of the Mithridatic\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n43. Nysa is situated near the Mesogis, resting for the most part against\r\nthe mountain. It is as it were a double town, for a kind of torrent\r\nwatercourse divides it into two parts, and forms a valley, one part of\r\nwhich has a bridge over it, connecting the two towns; the other is\r\nadorned with an amphitheatre; underneath it is a passage through which\r\nthe waters of the torrents flow out of sight.\r\n\r\nNear the theatre are situated[108] two heights; below one lies the\r\ngymnasium for the young men; below the other is the forum, and a place\r\nof exercise for older persons. To the south below the city lies the\r\nplain, as at Tralles.\r\n\r\n44. On the road between Tralles and Nysa is a village of the Nysæans,\r\nnot far from the city Acharaca, in which is the Plutonium, to which is\r\nattached a large grove, a temple of Pluto and Proserpine, and the\r\nCharonium, a cave which overhangs the grove, and possesses some singular\r\nphysical properties. The sick, it is said, who have confidence in the\r\ncures performed by these deities, resort thither, and live in the\r\nvillage near the cave, among experienced priests, who sleep at night in\r\nthe open air, on behoof of the sick, and direct the modes of cure by\r\ntheir dreams. The priests invoke the gods to cure the sick, and\r\nfrequently take them into the cave, where, as in a den, they are placed\r\nto remain in quiet without food for several days. Sometimes the sick\r\nthemselves observe their own dreams, but apply to these persons, in\r\ntheir character of priests and guardians of the mysteries, to interpret\r\nthem, and to counsel what is to be done. To others the place is\r\ninterdicted and fatal.\r\n\r\nAn annual festival, to which there is a general resort, is celebrated at\r\nAcharaca, and at that time particularly are to be [CAS. 650] seen and\r\nheard those who frequent it, conversing about cures performed\r\nthere.[109] During this feast the young men of the gymnasium and the\r\nephebi, naked and anointed with oil,[110] carry off a bull by stealth at\r\nmidnight, and hurry it away into the cave. It is then let loose, and\r\nafter proceeding a short distance falls down and expires.\r\n\r\n45. Thirty stadia from Nysa, as you cross the Mesogis towards the\r\nsouthern parts of Mount Tmolus,[111] is a place called Leimon, or the\r\nMeadow, to which the Nysæans and all the people around repair when they\r\ncelebrate a festival. Not far from this plain is an aperture in the\r\nground, sacred to the same deities, which aperture is said to extend as\r\nfar as Acharaca. They say that the poet mentions this meadow, in the\r\nwords,\r\n\r\n   “On the Asian mead,”[112]\r\n\r\nand they show a temple dedicated to two heroes, Caÿstrius and Asius, and\r\nthe Caÿster flowing near it.\r\n\r\n46. Historians relate that three brothers, Athymbrus, Athymbradus, and\r\nHydrelus, coming hither from Lacedæmon, founded (three?) cities, to\r\nwhich they gave their own names; that the population of these towns\r\nafterwards declined, but that out of these jointly Nysa was peopled. The\r\nNysæans at present regard Athymbrus as their founder.\r\n\r\n47. Beyond the Mæander and in the neighbourhood are considerable\r\nsettlements, Coscinia[113] and Orthosia, and on this side the river,\r\nBriula, Mastaura,[114] Acharaca, and above the city on the mountain,\r\nAroma; the letter _o_ is shortened in the pronunciation. From this\r\nlatter place is obtained the Aromeus, the best Mesogitian wine.\r\n\r\n48. Among illustrious natives of Nysa were Apollonius the Stoic\r\nphilosopher, the most eminent of the disciples of Panætius, and of\r\nMenecrates, the disciple of Aristarchus; Aristodemus, the son of\r\nMenecrates, whom, when I was a very young man, I heard lecturing on\r\nphilosophy, in extreme old age, at Nysa; Sostratus, the brother of\r\nAristodemus, and another Aristodemus, his cousin, the master of Pompey\r\nthe Great, were distinguished grammarians. My master taught rhetoric\r\nalso at Rhodes, and in his own country he had two schools; in the\r\nmorning he taught rhetoric, in the evening grammar. When he\r\nsuperintended the education of the children of Pompey at Rome, he was\r\nsatisfied with teaching a school of grammar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The places beyond the Mæander, which remain to be described, belong\r\nto the Carians. The Carians here are not intermixed with Lydians, but\r\noccupy the whole country by themselves, if we except a small portion of\r\nthe sea-coast, of which the Milesians and Mysians have taken possession.\r\n\r\nCaria[115] begins on the sea-coast opposite to Rhodes, and ends at\r\nPoseidium,[116] belonging to the Milesians. In the interior are the\r\nextremities of Taurus, which extend as far as the Mæander. For the\r\nmountains situated above the Chelidonian islands,[117] as they are\r\ncalled, which lie in front of the confines of Pamphylia and Lycia, are,\r\nit is said, the beginning of the Taurus; for the Taurus has there some\r\nelevation, and indeed a mountainous ridge of Taurus separates the whole\r\nof Lycia towards the exterior and the southern part from Cibyra and its\r\ndistrict, as far as the country opposite to Rhodes. Even there a\r\nmountainous tract is continued; it is, however, much lower in height,\r\nand is not considered as any longer belonging to Taurus, nor is there\r\nthe distinction of parts lying within and parts lying without the\r\nTaurus, on account of the eminences and depressions being scattered\r\nabout through the whole country both in breadth and length, and not\r\npresenting anything like a separation-wall.\r\n\r\nThe whole voyage along the coast, including the winding [CAS. 651] of\r\nthe bays, is 4900 stadia, and that along the country opposite to Rhodus\r\n1500 stadia.\r\n\r\n2. The beginning of this tract is Dædala,[118] a stronghold; and ends at\r\nthe mountain Phœnix,[119] as it is called, both of which belong to the\r\nRhodian territory. In front, at the distance of 120 stadia from Rhodes,\r\nlies Eleussa.[120] In sailing from Dædala towards the west in a straight\r\nline along Cilicia, Pamphylia, and Lycia, in the midway is a bay called\r\nGlaucus, with good harbours; then is the promontory Artemisium, and a\r\ntemple; next, the grove sacred to Latona; above this, and at the\r\ndistance of 60 stadia, is Calynda, a city; then Caunus,[121] and a deep\r\nriver near it, the Calbis,[122] which may be entered by vessels; between\r\nthese is Pisilis.\r\n\r\n3. The city Caunus has a naval arsenal and a close harbour. Above the\r\ncity upon a height is Imbrus, a stronghold. Although the country is\r\nfertile, yet the city is allowed by all to be unhealthy in summer, on\r\naccount of the heat, and in autumn, from the abundance of fruits.\r\n\r\nStories of the following kind are related respecting the city.\r\nStratonicus, the player on the cithara, seeing the Caunians somewhat\r\ndark and yellow,[123] said that this was what the poet meant in the\r\nline,\r\n\r\n   “As are the leaves, so is the race of men.”[124]\r\n\r\nWhen he was accused of ridiculing the unhealthiness of the city, he\r\nanswered, “Can I be so bold as to call that city unhealthy, where even\r\nthe dead walk about?”\r\n\r\nThe Caunians once revolted from the Rhodians, but, by a decision of the\r\nRomans, they were received again by the Rhodians into favour. There is\r\nin existence an oration of Molo against the Caunians.\r\n\r\nIt is said that they speak the same language as the Carians, that they\r\ncame from Crete, and retained their own laws and customs.[125]\r\n\r\n4. Next is Physcus,[126] a small town; it has a port and a grove sacred\r\nto Latona: then Loryma, a rugged line of sea-coast, and a mountain, the\r\nhighest of any in that quarter, on the summit of which is Phœnix, a\r\nstronghold, of the same name as the mountain. In front is the island\r\nEleussa, at the distance of 4 stadia. Its circumference is about 8\r\nstadia.\r\n\r\n5. The city of the Rhodians is on the eastern promontory. With regard to\r\nharbours, roads, walls, and other buildings, it so much surpasses other\r\ncities, that we know of none equal, much less superior to it.\r\n\r\nTheir political constitution and laws were excellent, and the care\r\nadmirable with which they administered affairs of state generally, and\r\nparticularly those relative to their marine. Hence being for a long\r\nperiod masters of the sea, they put an end to piracy, and became allies\r\nof the Romans, and of those kings who were well affected to the Romans\r\nand the Greeks; hence also the city was suffered to preserve her\r\nindependence, and was embellished with many votive offerings. These are\r\ndistributed in various places, but the greatest part of them are\r\ndeposited in the Dionysium and in the gymnasium. The most remarkable is\r\nthe Colossus of the Sun, which, the author of the iambics says, was\r\n\r\n   “seventy cubits in height, the work of Chares of Lindus.”\r\n\r\nIt now lies on the ground, having been thrown down by an earthquake, and\r\nis broken off at the knees. An oracle prohibited its being raised again.\r\nThis is the most remarkable of the votive offerings, and it is allowed\r\nto be one of the seven wonders of the world.[127] There were also the\r\npictures by Protogenes,[128] the Ialysus, and the Satyr, who was\r\nrepresented [CAS. 652] standing by a pillar. On the top of the pillar\r\nwas a partridge. The bird strongly attracted, as was natural, the gaping\r\nadmiration of the people, when the picture was first hung up in public,\r\nand they were so much delighted, that the Satyr, although executed with\r\ngreat skill, was not noticed. The partridge-breeders were still more\r\nstruck with the picture of the bird. They brought tame partridges,\r\nwhich, when placed opposite to the picture, made their call, and drew\r\ntogether crowds of people. When Protogenes observed that the principal\r\nhad become the subordinate part of his work, he obtained permission of\r\nthe curators of the temple to efface the bird, which he did.\r\n\r\nThe Rhodians, although their form of government is not democratic, are\r\nattentive to the welfare of the people, and endeavour to maintain the\r\nmultitude of poor. The people receive allowances of corn, and the rich\r\nsupport the needy, according to an ancient usage. There are also public\r\noffices in the state, the object of which is to procure and distribute\r\nprovisions,[129] so that the poor may obtain subsistence, and the city\r\nnot suffer for want of persons to serve her, especially in manning her\r\nfleets.\r\n\r\nSome of the dockyards are kept private, and the multitude are prohibited\r\nfrom seeing them. If any person should be found inspecting, or to have\r\nentered them, he would be punished with death. As at Massalia and\r\nCyzicus,[130] so here particularly, everything relating to architects,\r\nthe manufacture of engines, stores of arms, and of other materials, is\r\nadministered with peculiar care, much more so than in other places.\r\n\r\n6. Like the people of Halicarnassus,[131] Cnidus, and Cos, the Rhodians\r\nare of Doric origin. Some of the Dorians, who founded Megara after the\r\ndeath of Codrus, remained there; others associated themselves with the\r\ncolony which went to Crete under the conduct of Althæmenes the Argive;\r\nthe rest were distributed at Rhodus, and among the cities just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nBut these migrations are more recent than the events related by Homer.\r\nFor Cnidus and Halicarnassus were not then in existence. Rhodes and Cos\r\nexisted, but were inhabited by Heracleidæ. Tlepolemus, when he attained\r\nmanhood,\r\n\r\n   “slew the maternal uncle of his father, the aged Licymnius. He\r\n   immediately built ships, and, collecting a large body of\r\n   people, fled away with them:”[132]\r\n\r\nand adds afterwards—\r\n\r\n   “after many sufferings on the voyage, he came to Rhodes; they\r\n   settled there according to their tribes, in three bodies:”\r\n\r\nand mentions by name the cities then existing[133]—\r\n\r\n   “Lindus, Ialysus, and the white Cameirus,”\r\n\r\nthe city of the Rhodians not being yet founded.\r\n\r\nHomer does not here mention Dorians by name, but means Æolians and\r\nBœotians, since Hercules and Licymnius lived in Bœotia. If however, as\r\nothers relate, Tlepolemus set out from Argos and Tiryns, even so the\r\ncolony would not be Dorian, for it was settled before the return of the\r\nHeracleidæ.\r\n\r\nAnd of the Coans also Homer says—\r\n\r\n   “their leaders were Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of\r\n   Thessalus the King, an Heracleid;”[134]\r\n\r\nand these names designate rather an Æolian than a Dorian origin.\r\n\r\n7. Rhodes was formerly called Ophiussa and Stadia, then Telchinis, from\r\nthe Telchines, who inhabited the island.[135]\r\n\r\nThese Telchines are called by some writers charmers and enchanters, who\r\nbesprinkle animals and plants, with a view to destroy them, with the\r\nwater of the Styx, mingled with sulphur. Others on the contrary say,\r\nthat they were persons who excelled in certain mechanical arts, and that\r\nthey were calumniated by jealous rivals, and thus acquired a bad\r\nreputation; that they came from Crete, and first landed at Cyprus, and\r\nthen removed to Rhodes. They were the first workers in iron and brass,\r\nand were the makers of Saturn’s scythe.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of them before, but the variety of fables [CAS. 654]\r\nwhich are related of them induces me to resume their history, and to\r\nsupply what may have been omitted.\r\n\r\n8. After the Telchines, the Heliadæ[136] were said, according to\r\nfabulous accounts, to have occupied the island. One of these Heliadæ,\r\nCercaphus, and his wife Cydippe had children, who founded the cities\r\ncalled after their names—\r\n\r\n   “Lindus, Ialysus, and the white Cameirus.”[137]\r\n\r\nOthers say, that Tlepolemus founded them, and gave to them the names of\r\nsome of the daughters of Danaüs.\r\n\r\n9. The present city was built during the Peloponnesian war, by the same\r\narchitect,[138] it is said, who built the Piræus. The Piræus, however,\r\ndoes not continue to exist, having formerly sustained injuries from the\r\nLacedæmonians, who threw down the walls, and then from Sylla, the Roman\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n10. It is related of the Rhodians that their maritime affairs were in a\r\nflourishing state, not only from the time of the foundation of the\r\npresent city, but that many years before the institution of the Olympic\r\nfestival, they sailed to a great distance from their own country for the\r\nprotection of sailors. They sailed as far as Spain, and there founded\r\nRhodus, which the people of Marseilles afterwards occupied; they founded\r\nParthenope[139] among the Opici, and Elpiæ in Daunia, with the\r\nassistance of Coans. Some authors relate, that after their return from\r\nTroy they colonized the Gymnasian islands. According to Timæus, the\r\ngreater of these islands is the largest known,[140] next the seven\r\nfollowing, Sardinia, Sicily, Cyprus, Crete, Eubœa,[141] Corsica, and\r\nLesbos; but this is a mistake, for these others are much larger. It is\r\nsaid, that gymnetes (or light-armed soldiers[142]) are called by the\r\nPhœnicians balearides, and that from hence the Gymnasian islands were\r\ncalled Balearides.\r\n\r\nSome of the Rhodians settled in the neighbourhood of Sybaris, in the\r\nChonian territory.[143] Homer seems to bear evidence of the former\r\nprosperity of the Rhodians, from the very foundation of the three\r\ncities;\r\n\r\n   “they settled according to their tribes, in three companies,\r\n   and were the favourites of Jupiter, who showered upon them\r\n   great wealth.”[144]\r\n\r\nOther writers have applied these verses to a fable, according to which,\r\nat the birth of Minerva, it rained gold on the island from the head of\r\nJupiter, as Pindar has said.[145]\r\n\r\nThe island is 920 stadia in circumference.\r\n\r\n11. In sailing from the city, and leaving the island on the right hand,\r\nthe first place we meet with is Lindus,[146] a city situated on a\r\nmountain extending far towards the south, and particularly towards\r\nAlexandreia (in Egypt).[147] There is here a celebrated temple of the\r\nLindian Diana, built by the Danaides. Formerly, the Lindians, like the\r\ninhabitants of Cameirus,[148] and Ialyssus, formed an independent state,\r\nbut afterwards they all settled at Rhodes.\r\n\r\nCleobulus, one of the seven wise men, was a native of Lindus.\r\n\r\n12. Next to Lindus is Ixia,[149] a stronghold, and Mnasyrium; then the\r\nAtabyris,[150] the highest mountain in the island, sacred to Jupiter\r\nAtabyrius; then Cameirus; then Ialysus a village, and above it is an\r\nacropolis called Ochyroma (the Fortification); then, at the distance of\r\nabout 80 stadia, the city of the Rhodians. Between these is the\r\nThoantium, a sort of beach, immediately in front of which are situated\r\nthe Sporades islands lying about Chalcis, which we have mentioned\r\nbefore.[151]\r\n\r\n13. There have been many remarkable persons, natives of Rhodes, both\r\ngenerals and athletæ, among whom were the ancestors of Panætius the\r\nphilosopher. Among statesmen, orators, and philosophers, were Panætius,\r\nStratocles, Andronicus the Peripatetic, Leonides the Stoic, and long\r\nbefore the time of these persons, Praxiphanes, Hieronymus, and Eudēmus.\r\nPoseidonius was concerned in the administration of the affairs of state,\r\nand taught philosophy at Rhodes, (but he was a native of Apameia in\r\nSyria,) as did Apollonius Malacus, and [CAS. 655] Molon, who were\r\nnatives of Alabanda, and disciples of Menecles the rhetorician.\r\nApollonius had resided at Rhodes long before, but Molon came late;\r\nwhence the former said to him “late comer,” Ὀψὲ μολών, instead of\r\nἐλθών[152] Peisander, a Rhodian poet, author of the Heracleia; Simmias\r\nthe grammarian, and Aristocles, of our time. Dionysius the Thracian, and\r\nApollonius, author of the Argonautics, although natives of Alexandreia,\r\nwere called Rhodians.\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient on the subject of the island of Rhodes.\r\n\r\n14. There is a bend of the Carian coast opposite to Rhodes, immediately\r\nafter Eleus[153] and Loryma, towards the north, and then the ship’s\r\ncourse is in a straight line to the Propontis,[154] and forms as it were\r\na meridian line of about 500 stadia in length, or somewhat less. Along\r\nthis line are situated the remainder of Caria, Ionians, Æolians, Troy,\r\nand the parts about Cyzicus and Byzantium. Next to Loryma is the\r\nCynossema, or dogs’ monument,[155] and the island Syme.[156]\r\n\r\n15. Then follows Cnidus,[157] which has two harbours, one of which is a\r\nclose harbour, fit for receiving triremes, and a naval station for 20\r\nvessels. In front of Cnidus is an island, in circumference about 7\r\nstadia; it rises high, in the form of a theatre, and is united by a mole\r\nto the continent, and almost makes Cnidus a double city, for a great\r\npart of the inhabitants occupy the island, which shelters both harbours.\r\nOpposite to it, far out at sea, is Nisyrus.[158]\r\n\r\nIllustrious natives of Cnidus were, first, Eudoxus the mathematician, a\r\ndisciple of Plato’s; Agatharchides, the Peripatetic philosopher and\r\nhistorian; Theopompus, one of the most powerful of the friends of divus\r\nCæsar, and his son Artemidorus. Ctesias also, the physician of\r\nArtaxerxes, was a native of this place. He wrote a history of Assyria\r\nand Persia.\r\n\r\nNext after Cnidus are Ceramus[159] and Bargasa, small towns overlooking\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n16. Then follows Halicarnasus, formerly called Zephyra, the royal seat\r\nof the dynasts of Caria. Here is the sepulchre of Mausolus, one of\r\nthe seven wonders of the world;[160] Artemisia erected it, in honour\r\nof her husband. Here also is the fountain Salmacis, which has a bad\r\nrepute, for what reason I know not, for making those who drink of it\r\neffeminate. Mankind, enervated by luxury, impute the blame of its\r\neffects to different kinds of air and water, but these are not the\r\ncauses of luxury, but riches and intemperance.\r\n\r\nThere is an acropolis at Halicarnasus. In front of it lies\r\nArconnesus.[161] It had, among others, as its founders, Anthes and a\r\nbody of Trœzenians.[162]\r\n\r\nAmong the natives of Halicarnasus were Herodotus the historian, who was\r\nafterwards called Thurius, because he was concerned in sending out the\r\ncolony to Thurii; Heracleitus the poet, the friend of Callimachus; and\r\nin our time, Dionysius the historian.\r\n\r\n17. Halicarnasus suffered, when it was taken by storm by Alexander.\r\nHecatomnus, who was then king of the Carians, had three sons, Mausolus,\r\nHidrieus, and Pixodarus, and two daughters. Mausolus, the eldest son,\r\nmarried Artemisia, the eldest daughter; Hidrieus, the second son,\r\nmarried Ada, the other sister. Mausolus came to the throne, and, dying\r\nwithout children, left the kingdom to his wife, by whom the\r\nabove-mentioned sepulchre was erected. She pined away for grief at the\r\nloss of her husband. Hidrieus succeeded her; he died a natural death,\r\nand was succeeded by his wife Ada. She was ejected by Pixodarus, the\r\nsurviving son of Hecatomnus. Having espoused the party of the Persians,\r\nPixodarus sent for a satrap to share the kingdom with him. After the\r\ndeath of Pixodarus, the satrap became master of Halicarnasus. But upon\r\nthe arrival of Alexander, he sustained a siege. His wife was Ada,\r\ndaughter of Pixodarus, and Aphneïs, a woman of Cappadocia. But Ada, the\r\ndaughter of Hecatomnus, whom Pixodarus ejected, entreated Alexander, and\r\nendeavoured to prevail upon him to reïnstate her in the kingdom of which\r\nshe had been deprived; she promised (in return) her assistance in\r\nreducing to obedience the parts of the country which had revolted; for\r\nthe persons who were in possession of them [CAS. 657] were her\r\nrelations and subjects. She also delivered up Alinda where she herself\r\nresided. Alexander granted her request and proclaimed her queen, after\r\nthe city was taken, but not the acropolis, which was doubly fortified.\r\nHe assigned to Ada the siege of the acropolis, which was taken in a\r\nshort time afterwards, the besiegers having attacked it with fury and\r\nexasperation at the resistance of the besieged.\r\n\r\n18. Next is Termerium,[163] a promontory of the Myndians, opposite to\r\nwhich lies Scandaria, a promontory of Cos, distant 40 stadia from the\r\ncontinent. There is also above the promontory a fortress, Termerum.\r\n\r\n19. The city of the Coans was formerly called Astypalæa, and was built\r\nin another place, but is at present on the sea-coast. Afterwards, on\r\naccount of a sedition, they migrated to the present city, near\r\nScandarium, and changed the name to that of the island, Cos. The city is\r\nnot large, but beautifully built, and a most pleasing sight to mariners\r\nwho are sailing by the coast. The island is about 550 stadia in\r\ncircumference. The whole of it is fertile, and produces, like Chios and\r\nLesbos, excellent wine. It has, towards the south, the promontory\r\nLaceter,[164] from which to Nicyrus is 60 stadia, and near Laceter is\r\nHalisarna, a stronghold; on the west is Drecanum, and a village called\r\nStomalimne. Drecanum is distant about 200 stadia from the city. The\r\npromontory Laceter adds to the length of the navigation 35 stadia. In\r\nthe suburb is the celebrated temple Asclepieium, full of votive\r\nofferings, among which is the Antigonus of Apelles. It formerly\r\ncontained the Venus Anadyomene, (Venus emerging from the sea,) but that\r\nis now at Rome, dedicated to divus Cæsar by Augustus, who consecrated to\r\nhis father the picture of her who was the author of his family. It is\r\nsaid that the Coans obtained, as a compensation for the loss of this\r\npainting, an abatement, amounting to a hundred talents, of their usual\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that Hippocrates learned and practised the dietetic part of\r\nmedicine from the narrative of cures suspended in the temple. He is one\r\nof the illustrious natives of Cos. Simus, also, the physician, Philetas\r\nthe poet and critic, Nicias of our time, who was tyrant of Cos; Ariston,\r\nthe disciple and heir of Ariston the Peripatetic philosopher; and\r\nTheomnestus, a minstrel of name, who was of the opposite political party\r\nto Nicias.\r\n\r\n20. On the coast of the continent opposite to the Myndian territory is\r\nAstypalæa a promontory, and Zephyrium. The city Myndus follows\r\nimmediately after, which has a harbour; then the city Bargylia. In the\r\nintervening distance is Caryanda[165] a harbour, and an island of the\r\nsame name, occupied by Caryandians. Scylax the ancient historian was a\r\nnative of this island. Near Bargylia is the temple of Artemis Cindyas,\r\nround which the rain falls, it is believed, without touching it. There\r\nwas once a strong place called Cindya.\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished natives of Bargylia was Protarchus the\r\nEpicurean; Demetrius surnamed Lacon was his disciple.\r\n\r\n21. Next follows Iasus, situated upon an island,[166] on the side\r\ntowards the continent. It has a port, and the inhabitants derive the\r\ngreatest part of their subsistence from the sea, which abounds with\r\nfish, but the soil is very barren. Stories of the following kind are\r\nrelated of Iasus.\r\n\r\nAs a player on the cithara was displaying his art in public, every one\r\nlistened to him attentively till the market bell rung for the sale of\r\nfish, when he was deserted by all except one man, who was quite deaf.\r\nThe minstrel coming up to him said, “Friend, I am much obliged to you\r\nfor the honour you have done me, and I admire your love of music, for\r\nall the others have left me at the sound of the bell.”—“What say you,\r\nhas the bell rung?”—“Yes, he replied?”—“Good bye to you,” said the man,\r\nand away he also went.\r\n\r\nDiodorus the Dialectician was a native of this place. He was surnamed\r\nCronus (or Old Time); the title was not properly his from the first; it\r\nwas his master Apollonius who (in the first instance) had received the\r\nsurname of Cronus, but it was transferred to Diodorus on account of the\r\nwant of celebrity in the true Cronus.\r\n\r\n22. Next to Iasus is Cape Poseidium[167] of the Milesians. In the\r\ninterior are three considerable cities, Mylasa,[168] Stratoniceia,[169]\r\nand Alabanda.[170] The others are guard forts to these or to the\r\nmaritime towns, as Amyzon, Heracleia, Euromus, Chalcetor. But we make\r\nlittle account of these.\r\n\r\n23. Mylasa is situated in a very fertile plain; a mountain, containing a\r\nvery beautiful marble quarry, overhangs the city; and it is no small\r\nadvantage to have stone for building [CAS. 659] in abundance and near\r\nat hand, particularly for the construction of temples and other public\r\nedifices; consequently, no city is embellished more beautifully than\r\nthis with portico and temples. It is a subject of surprise, however,\r\nthat persons should be guilty of the absurdity of building the city at\r\nthe foot of a perpendicular and lofty precipice. One of the governors of\r\nthe province is reported to have said, when he expressed his\r\nastonishment at this circumstance, “If the founder of the city had no\r\nfear, he had no shame.”\r\n\r\nThe Mylasians have two temples, one of Jupiter called Osogo, and another\r\nof Jupiter Labrandenus. The former is in the city. Labranda is a village\r\non the mountain, near the passage across it from Alabanda to Mylasa, at\r\na distance from the city. At Labranda is an ancient temple of Jupiter,\r\nand a statue of Jupiter Stratius, who is worshipped by the neighbouring\r\npeople and by the inhabitants of Mylasa. There is a paved road for a\r\ndistance of about 60 stadia from the temple to the city; it is called\r\nthe Sacred Way, along which the sacred things are carried in procession.\r\nThe most distinguished citizens are always the priests, and hold office\r\nduring life. These temples belong peculiarly to the city. There is a\r\nthird temple of the Carian Jupiter, common to all the Carians, in the\r\nuse of which the Lydians, also, and Mysians participate, as being\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nMylasa is said to have been anciently a village, but the native place\r\nand royal residence of Hecatomnus and the Carians. The city approaches\r\nnearest to the sea at Physcus, which is their naval arsenal.\r\n\r\n24. Mylasa has produced in our time illustrious men, who were at once\r\norators and demagogues, Euthydemus and Hybreas. Euthydemus inherited\r\nfrom his ancestors great wealth and reputation. He possessed commanding\r\neloquence, and was regarded as a person of eminence, not only in his own\r\ncountry, but was thought worthy of the highest honours even in Asia. The\r\nfather of Hybreas, as he used to relate the circumstance in his school,\r\nand as it was confirmed by his fellow-citizens, left him a mule which\r\ncarried wood, and a mule driver. He was maintained for a short time by\r\ntheir labour, and was enabled to attend the lectures of Diotrephes of\r\nAntioch. On his return he held the office of superintendent of the\r\nmarket. But here being harassed, and gaining but little profit, he\r\napplied himself to the affairs of the state, and to attend to the\r\nbusiness of the forum. He quickly advanced himself and became an object\r\nof admiration, even during the lifetime of Euthydemus, and still more\r\nafter his death, as the leading person in the city. Euthydemus possessed\r\ngreat power, and used it for the benefit of the city, so that if some of\r\nhis acts were rather tyrannical, this character was lost in their public\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nThe saying of Hybreas, at the conclusion of an harangue to the people,\r\nis applauded: “Euthydemus, you are an evil necessary to the city; for we\r\ncan live neither with thee nor without thee.”[171]\r\n\r\nHybreas, although he had acquired great power, and had the reputation of\r\nbeing both a good citizen and an excellent orator, was defeated in his\r\npolitical opposition to Labienus. For the citizens, unarmed, and\r\ndisposed to peace, surrendered to Labienus, who attacked them with a\r\nbody of troops and with Parthian auxiliaries, the Parthians being at\r\nthat time masters of Asia. But Zeno of Laodiceia and Hybreas, both of\r\nthem orators, did not surrender, but caused their own cities to revolt.\r\nHybreas provoked Labienus, an irritable and vain young man, by saying,\r\nwhen the youth announced himself emperor of the Parthians, “Then I shall\r\ncall myself emperor of the Carians.” Upon this Labienus marched against\r\nthe city, having with him cohorts drafted from the Roman soldiery\r\nstationed in Asia. He did not however take Hybreas prisoner, who had\r\nretreated to Rhodes, but plundered and destroyed his house, which\r\ncontained costly furniture, and treated the whole city in the same\r\nmanner. After Labienus had left Asia, Hybreas returned, and restored his\r\nown affairs and those of the city to their former state.\r\n\r\nThis then on the subject of Mylasa.\r\n\r\n25. Stratoniceia is a colony of Macedonians. It was embellished by the\r\nkings with costly edifices. In the district of the Stratoniceians are\r\ntwo temples. The most celebrated, that of Hecate, is at Lagina, where\r\nevery year great multitudes assemble at a great festival. Near the city\r\nis the temple of Jupiter Chrysaoreus,[172] which is common to all the\r\nCarians, and whither they repair to offer sacrifice, and to deliberate\r\non their common interests. They call this meeting the Chrysaoreon,\r\n[CAS. 660] which is composed of villages. Those who represent the\r\ngreatest number of villages have the precedency in voting, like the\r\nCeramiētæ. The Stratoniceians, although they are not of Carian race,\r\nhave a place in this assembly, because they possess villages included in\r\nthe Chrysaoric body.\r\n\r\nIn the time of our ancestors there flourished at Stratoniceia a\r\ndistinguished person, Menippus the orator, surnamed Catocas, whom\r\nCicero[173] commends in one of his writings above all the Asiatic\r\norators whom he had heard, comparing him to Xenocles, and to those who\r\nflourished at that time.\r\n\r\nThere is another Stratoniceia, called Stratoniceia at the Taurus, a\r\nsmall town adjacent to the mountain.\r\n\r\n26. Alabanda lies at the foot of two eminences, in such a manner as to\r\npresent the appearance of an ass with panniers. On this account\r\nApollonius Malacus ridicules the city, and also because it abounds with\r\nscorpions; he says, it was an ass, with panniers full of scorpions.\r\n\r\nThis city and Mylasa, and the whole mountainous tract between them,\r\nswarm with these reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Alabanda are addicted to luxury and debauchery. It\r\ncontains a great number of singing girls.\r\n\r\nNatives of Alabanda, distinguished persons, were two orators, brothers,\r\nMenecles, whom we mentioned a little above, and Hierocles, Apollonius,\r\nand Molo; the two latter afterwards went to Rhodes.\r\n\r\n27. Among the various accounts which are circulated respecting the\r\nCarians, the most generally received is that the Carians, then called\r\nLeleges, were governed by Minos, and occupied the islands. Then removing\r\nto the continent, they obtained possession of a large tract of sea-coast\r\nand of the interior, by driving out the former occupiers, who were, for\r\nthe most part, Leleges and Pelasgi. The Greeks again, Ionians and\r\nDorians, deprived the Carians of a portion of the country.\r\n\r\nAs proofs of their eager pursuit of war, the handles of shields, badges,\r\nand crests, all of which are called Carian, are alleged. Anacreon says,\r\n\r\n   “Come, grasp the well-made Caric handles;”\r\n\r\nand Alcæus—\r\n\r\n   “Shaking a Carian crest.”\r\n\r\n28. But when Homer uses these expressions, “Masthles commanded the\r\nCarians, who speak a barbarous language,”[174] it does not appear why,\r\nwhen he was acquainted with so many barbarous nations, he mentions the\r\nCarians alone as using a barbarous language, but does not call any\r\npeople Barbarians. Nor is Thucydides right, who says that none were\r\ncalled Barbarians, because as yet the Greeks were not distinguished by\r\nany one name as opposed to some other. But Homer himself refutes this\r\nposition that the Greeks were not distinguished by this name:\r\n\r\n   “A man whose fame has spread through Greece and Argos;”[175]\r\n\r\nand in another place—\r\n\r\n   “But if you wish to go through Hellas and the middle of Argos.”[176]\r\n\r\nBut if there was no such term as Barbarian, how could he properly speak\r\nof people as Barbarophonoi (i. e. speaking a barbarous language)?\r\n\r\nNeither is Thucydides nor Apollonius the grammarian right, because the\r\nGreeks, and particularly the Ionians, applied to the Carians a common\r\nterm in a peculiar and vituperative sense, in consequence of their\r\nhatred of them for their animosity and continual hostile incursions.\r\nUnder these circumstances he might call them Barbarians. But we ask,\r\nwhy does he call them Barbarophonoi, but not once Barbarians? Because,\r\nreplies Apollonius, the plural number does not fall in with the metre;\r\nthis is the reason why Homer does not call them Barbarians. Admitting\r\nthen that the genitive case (βαρβάρων) does not fall in with the\r\nmeasure of the verse, the nominative case (βάρβαροι) does not differ\r\nfrom that of Dardani (Δάρδανοι);\r\n\r\n   “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardani;”\r\n\r\nand of the same kind is the word Troïi[177] in this verse,\r\n\r\n   “Like the Troïi horses” (Τρώιοι ἵπποι).\r\n\r\nNor is the reason to be found in the alleged excessive harshness of the\r\nCarian language, for it is not extremely harsh; and besides, according\r\nto Philippus, the author of a history of Caria, their language contains\r\na very large mixture of Greek words.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 661] I suppose that the word “barbarian” was at first invented to\r\ndesignate a mode of pronunciation which was embarrassed, harsh, and\r\nrough; as we use the words battarizein, traulizein, psellizein,[178] to\r\nexpress the same thing. For we are naturally very much disposed to\r\ndenote certain sounds by names expressive of those sounds, and\r\ncharacteristic of their nature; and hence invented terms abound,\r\nexpressive of the sounds which they designate, as kelaryzein, clange,\r\npsophos, boe, krotos,[179] most of which words are at present used in an\r\nappropriate sense.\r\n\r\nAs those who pronounce their words with a thick enunciation are called\r\nBarbarians, so foreigners, I mean those who were not Greeks, were\r\nobserved to pronounce their words in this manner. The term Barbarians\r\nwas therefore applied peculiarly to these people, at first by way of\r\nreproach, as having a thick and harsh enunciation; afterwards the term\r\nwas used improperly, and applied as a common gentile term in\r\ncontradistinction to the Greeks. For after a long intimacy and\r\nintercourse had subsisted with the Barbarians, it no longer appeared\r\nthat this peculiarity arose from any thickness of enunciation, or a\r\nnatural defect in the organs of the voice, but from the peculiarities of\r\ntheir languages.\r\n\r\nBut there was in our language a bad and what might be called a barbarous\r\nutterance, as when any person speaking Greek should not pronounce it\r\ncorrectly, but should pronounce the words like the Barbarians, who, when\r\nbeginning to learn the Greek language, are not able to pronounce it\r\nperfectly, as neither are we able to pronounce perfectly their\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThis was peculiarly the case with the Carians. For other nations had not\r\nmuch intercourse with the Greeks, nor were disposed to adopt the Grecian\r\nmanner of life, nor to learn our language, with the exception of persons\r\nwho by accident and singly had associated with a few Greeks; but the\r\nCarians were dispersed over the whole of Greece, as mercenary soldiers.\r\nThen the barbarous pronunciation was frequently met with among them,\r\nfrom their military expeditions into Greece; and afterwards it spread\r\nmuch more, from the time that they occupied the islands together with\r\nthe Greeks: not even when driven thence into Asia, could they live\r\napart from Greeks, when the Ionians and Dorians arrived there.\r\n\r\nHence arose the expression, “to barbarize,” for we are accustomed to\r\napply this term to those whose pronunciation of the Greek language is\r\nvicious, and not to those who pronounce it like the Carians.\r\n\r\nWe are then to understand the expressions, “barbarous speaking” and\r\n“barbarous speakers,” of persons whose pronunciation of the Greek\r\nlanguage is faulty. The word “to barbarize” was formed after the word\r\n“to Carize,” and transferred into the books which teach the Greek\r\nlanguage; thus also the word “to solœcize” was formed, derived either\r\nfrom Soli or some other source.\r\n\r\n29. Artemidorus says that the journey from Physcus, on the coast\r\nopposite to Rhodes, towards Ephesus, as far as Lagina is 850 stadia;\r\nthence to Alabanda 250 stadia; to Tralles 160. About halfway on the road\r\nto Tralles the Mæander is crossed, and here are the boundaries of Caria.\r\nThe whole number of stadia from Physcus to the Mæander, along the road\r\nto Ephesus, is 1180 stadia. Again, along the same road, from the Mæander\r\nof Ionia to Tralles 80 stadia, to Magnesia 140 stadia, to Ephesus 120,\r\nto Smyrna 320, to Phocæa and the boundaries of Ionia, less than 200\r\nstadia; so that the length of Ionia in a straight line would be,\r\naccording to Artemidorus, a little more than 800 stadia.\r\n\r\nBut as there is a public frequented road by which all travellers pass on\r\ntheir way from Ephesus to the east, Artemidorus thus describes it. [From\r\nEphesus] to Carura, the boundary of Caria towards Phrygia, through\r\nMagnesia and Tralles, Nysa, Antioch, is a journey of 740 stadia. From\r\nCarura, the first town in Phrygia, through Laodiceia, Apameia,\r\nMetropolis, and Chelidoniæ,[180] to Holmi, the beginning of the\r\nParoreius, a country lying at the foot of the mountains, about 920\r\nstadia; to Tyriæum,[181] the termination towards Lycaonia of the\r\nParoreius,[182] through Philomelium[183] is little more than 500 stadia.\r\nNext is Lycaonia as far as Coropassus,[184] through Laodiceia in the\r\nCatacecaumene, 840 stadia; from Coropassus [CAS. 662] in Lycaonia to\r\nGarsaüra,[185] a small city of Cappadocia, situated on its borders, 120\r\nstadia; thence to Mazaca,[186] the metropolis of the Cappadocians,\r\nthrough Soandus and Sadacora, 680 stadia; thence to the Euphrates, as\r\nfar as Tomisa, a stronghold in Sophene, through Herphæ,[187] a small\r\ntown, 1440 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe places in a straight line with these, as far as India, are described\r\nin the same manner by Artemidorus and Eratosthenes. Polybius says, that\r\nwith respect to those places we ought chiefly to depend upon\r\nArtemidorus. He begins from Samosata in Commagene, which is situated at\r\nthe passage, and the Zeugma of the Euphrates, to Samosata across the\r\nTaurus, from the mountains of Cappadocia about Tomisa, he says is a\r\ndistance of 450 stadia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After the part of the coast opposite[188] to Rhodes, the boundary of\r\nwhich is Dædala, in sailing thence towards the east, we come to Lycia,\r\nwhich extends to Pamphylia; next is Pamphylia, extending as far as\r\nCilicia Tracheia, which reaches as far as the Cilicians, situated about\r\nthe Bay of Issus. These are parts of the peninsula, the isthmus of which\r\nwe said was the road from Issus as far as Amisus,[189] or, according to\r\nsome authors, to Sinope.\r\n\r\nThe country beyond the Taurus consists of the narrow line of sea-coast\r\nextending from Lycia to the places about Soli, the present Pompeiopolis.\r\nThen the sea-coast near the Bay of Issus, beginning from Soli and\r\nTarsus, spreads out into plains.\r\n\r\nThe description of this coast will complete the account of the whole\r\npeninsula. We shall then pass to the rest of Asia without the Taurus,\r\nand lastly we shall describe Africa.\r\n\r\n2. After Dædala of the Rhodians there is a mountain of Lycia, of the\r\nsame name, Dædala, and here the whole Lycian coast begins, and extends\r\n1720 stadia. This maritime tract is rugged, and difficult to be\r\napproached, but has very good harbours, and is inhabited by a people who\r\nare not inclined to acts of violence. The country is similar in nature\r\nto that of Pamphylia and Cilicia Tracheia. But the former used the\r\nplaces of shelter for vessels for piratical purposes themselves, or\r\nafforded to pirates a market for their plunder and stations for their\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nAt Side,[190] a city of Pamphylia, the Cilicians had places for building\r\nships. They sold their prisoners, whom they admitted were freemen, by\r\nnotice through the public crier.\r\n\r\nBut the Lycians continued to live as good citizens, and with so much\r\nrestraint upon themselves, that although the Pamphylians had succeeded\r\nin obtaining the sovereignty of the sea as far as Italy, yet they were\r\nnever influenced by the desire of base gain, and persevered in\r\nadministering the affairs of the state according to the laws of the\r\nLycian body.\r\n\r\n3. There are three and twenty cities in this body, which have votes.\r\nThey assemble from each city at a general congress, and select what city\r\nthey please for their place of meeting. Each of the largest cities\r\ncommands three votes, those of intermediate importance two, and the rest\r\none vote. They contribute in the same proportion to taxes and other\r\npublic charges. The six largest cities, according to Artemidorus, are\r\nXanthus,[191] Patara,[192] Pinara,[193] Olympus, Myra, Tlos,[194] which\r\nis situated at the pass of the mountain leading to Cibyra.\r\n\r\nAt the congress a lyciarch is first elected, then the other officers of\r\nthe body. Public tribunals are also appointed for [CAS. 665] the\r\nadministration of justice. Formerly they deliberated about war and\r\npeace, and alliances, but this is not now permitted, as these things are\r\nunder the control of the Romans. It is only done by their consent, or\r\nwhen it may be for their own advantage.\r\n\r\nThus judges and magistrates are elected according to the proportion of\r\nthe number of votes belonging to each city.[195] It was the fortune of\r\nthese people, who lived under such an excellent government, to retain\r\ntheir liberty under the Romans, and the laws and institutions of their\r\nancestors; to see also the entire extirpation of the pirates, first by\r\nServilius Isauricus, at the time that he demolished Isaura, and\r\nafterwards by Pompey the Great, who burnt more than 1300 vessels, and\r\ndestroyed their haunts and retreats. Of the survivors in these contests\r\nhe transferred some to Soli, which he called Pompeiopolis; others to\r\nDyme, which had a deficient population, and is now occupied by a Roman\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nThe poets, however, particularly the tragic poets, confound nations\r\ntogether; for instance, Trojans, Mysians, and Lydians, whom they call\r\nPhrygians, and give the name of Lycians to Carians.\r\n\r\n4. After Dædala is a Lycian mountain, and near it is Telmessus,[196] a\r\nsmall town of the Lycians, and Telmessis, a promontory with a harbour.\r\nEumenes took this place from the Romans in the war with Antiochus, but\r\nafter the dissolution of the kingdom of Pergamus, the Lycians recovered\r\nit again.\r\n\r\n5. Then follows Anticragus, a precipitous mountain, on which is\r\nCarmylessus,[197] a fortress situated in a gorge; next is Mount Cragus,\r\nwith eight peaks,[198] and a city of the same name. The neighbourhood of\r\nthese mountains is the scene of the fable of the Chimæra; and at no\r\ngreat distance is Chimæra, a sort of ravine, extending upwards from the\r\nshore. Below the Cragus in the interior is Pinara, which is one of the\r\nlargest cities of Lycia. Here Pandarus is worshipped, of the same name\r\nperhaps as the Trojan Pandarus;\r\n\r\n   “thus the pale nightingale, daughter of Pandarus;”[199]\r\n\r\nfor this Pandarus, it is said, came from Lycia.\r\n\r\n6. Next is the river Xanthus, formerly called Sirbis.[200] In sailing up\r\nit in vessels which ply as tenders, to the distance of 10 stadia, we\r\ncome to the Letoum, and proceeding 60 stadia beyond the temple, we find\r\nthe city of the Xanthians, the largest in Lycia. After the Xanthus\r\nfollows Patara, which is also a large city with a harbour, and\r\ncontaining a temple of Apollo. Its founder was Patarus. When Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus repaired it, he called it the Lycian Arsinoë, but the old\r\nname prevailed.\r\n\r\n7. Next is Myra, at the distance of 20 stadia from the sea, situated\r\nupon a lofty hill; then the mouth of the river Limyrus, and on ascending\r\nfrom it by land 20 stadia, we come to the small town Limyra. In the\r\nintervening distance along the coast above mentioned are many small\r\nislands and harbours. The most considerable of the islands is Cisthene,\r\non which is a city of the same name.[201] In the interior are the\r\nstrongholds Phellus, Antiphellus, and Chimæra, which I mentioned above.\r\n\r\n8. Then follow the Sacred Promontory[202] and the Chelidoniæ, three\r\nrocky islands, equal in size, and distant from each other about 5, and\r\nfrom the land 6 stadia. One of them has an anchorage for vessels.\r\nAccording to the opinion of many writers, the Taurus begins here,\r\nbecause the summit is lofty, and extends from the Pisidian mountains\r\nsituated above Pamphylia, and because the islands lying in front exhibit\r\na [CAS. 666] remarkable figure in the sea, like a skirt of a mountain.\r\nBut in fact the mountainous chain is continued from the country opposite\r\nRhodes to the parts near Pisidia, and this range of mountains is called\r\nTaurus.\r\n\r\nThe Chelidoniæ islands seem to be situated in a manner opposite to\r\nCanopus,[203] and the passage across is said to be 4000 stadia.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sacred Promontory to Olbia[204] there remain 367 stadia. In\r\nthis distance are Crambusa,[205] and Olympus[206] a large city, and a\r\nmountain of the same name, which is called also Phœnicus;[207] then\r\nfollows Corycus, a tract of sea-coast.\r\n\r\n9. Then follows Phaselis,[208] a considerable city, with three harbours\r\nand a lake. Above it is the mountain Solyma[209] and Termessus,[210] a\r\nPisidic city, situated on the defiles, through which there is a pass\r\nover the mountain to Milyas. Alexander demolished it, with the intention\r\nof opening the defiles.\r\n\r\nAbout Phaselis, near the sea, are narrow passes through which Alexander\r\nconducted his army. There is a mountain called Climax. It overhangs the\r\nsea of Pamphylia, leaving a narrow road along the coast, which in calm\r\nweather is not covered with water, and travellers can pass along it, but\r\nwhen the sea is rough, it is in a great measure hidden by the waves. The\r\npass over the mountains is circuitous and steep, but in fair weather\r\npersons travel on the road along the shore. Alexander came there when\r\nthere was a storm, and trusting generally to fortune, set out before the\r\nsea had receded, and the soldiers marched during the whole day up to the\r\nmiddle of the body in water.\r\n\r\nPhaselis also is a Lycian city, situated on the confines of Pamphylia.\r\nIt is not a part of the Lycian body, but is an independent city.\r\n\r\n10. The poet distinguishes the Solymi from the Lycians, when he\r\ndespatches Bellerophon by the king of the Lycians to this second\r\nadventure;\r\n\r\n   “he encountered the brave Solymi;”[211]\r\n\r\nother writers say that the Lycians were formerly called Solymi, and\r\nafterwards Termilæ, from the colonists that accompanied Sarpedon from\r\nCrete; and afterwards Lycians, from Lycus the son of Pandion, who, after\r\nhaving been banished from his own country, was admitted by Sarpedon to a\r\nshare in the government; but their story does not agree with Homer. We\r\nprefer the opinion of those who say that the poet called the people\r\nSolymi who have now the name of Milyæ, and whom we have mentioned\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After Phaselis is Olbia; here Pamphylia begins. It is a large\r\nfortress. It is followed by the Cataractes,[212] as it is called, a\r\nriver which descends violently from a lofty rock, with a great body of\r\nwater, like a winter torrent, so that the noise of it is heard at a\r\ngreat distance.\r\n\r\nNext is Attaleia,[213] a city, so called from its founder Attalus\r\nPhiladelphus, who also settled another colony at Corycus, a small city\r\nnear Attaleia, by introducing other inhabitants, and extending the\r\ncircuit of the walls.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that between Phaselis and Attaleia, Thebe and Lyrnessus[214]\r\nare shown; for, according to Callisthenes, a part of the Trojan\r\nCilicians were driven from the plain of Thebe into Pamphylia.\r\n\r\n2. Next is the river Cestrus;[215] on sailing up its stream 60 stadia we\r\nfind the city Perge,[216] and near it upon an elevated place, the temple\r\nof the Pergæan Artemis, where a general festival is celebrated every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThen at the distance of about 40 stadia from the sea is [Syllium],[217]\r\non an elevated site, and visible at Perge. Next is Capria, a lake of\r\nconsiderable extent; then the river Eurymedon;[218] sailing up it to the\r\ndistance of 60 stadia, we come to Aspendus,[219] a well-peopled city,\r\nfounded by Argives. Above it is Petnelissus;[220] then another river,\r\nand many small islands [CAS. 668] lying in front; then Side, a colony\r\nof the Cymæans, where there is a temple of Minerva. Near it is the coast\r\nof the Little Cibyratæ; then the river Melas,[221] and an anchorage for\r\nvessels; then Ptolemais[222] a city; next the borders of Pamphylia, and\r\nCoracesium,[223] where Cilicia Tracheia begins. The whole of the voyage\r\nalong the coast of Pamphylia is 640 stadia.\r\n\r\n3. Herodotus says,[224] that the Pamphylians are descendants of the\r\npeople who accompanied Amphilochus and Calchas from Troy, a mixture of\r\nvarious nations. The majority of them settled here, others were\r\ndispersed over different countries. Callinus says that Calchas died at\r\nClarus, but that some of the people who, together with Mopsus, crossed\r\nthe Taurus, remained in Pamphylia, and that others were scattered in\r\nCilicia and Syria, and as far even as Phœnicia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Of Cilicia without the Taurus one part is called Cilicia Tracheia,\r\nthe rugged; the other, Cilicia Pedias, the flat or plain country.\r\n\r\nThe coast of the Tracheia is narrow, and either has no level ground or\r\nit rarely occurs; besides this, the Taurus overhangs it, which is badly\r\ninhabited as far even as the northern side, about Isaura and the\r\nHomonadeis as far as Pisidia. This tract has the name of Tracheiotis,\r\nand the inhabitants that of Tracheiotæ. The flat or plain country\r\nextends from Soli and Tarsus as far as Issus, and the parts above, where\r\nthe Cappadocians are situated on the northern side of the Taurus. This\r\ntract consists chiefly of fertile plains.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the parts within the Taurus; I shall now\r\ndescribe those without the Taurus, beginning with the Tracheiotæ.\r\n\r\n2. The first place is Coracesium,[225] a fortress of the Cilicians,\r\nsituated upon an abrupt rock. Diodotus surnamed Tryphon used it as a\r\nrendezvous at the time that he caused Syria to revolt from her kings,\r\nand carried on war against them with various success. Antiochus, the son\r\nof Demetrius, obliged him to shut himself up in one of the fortresses,\r\nand there he killed himself.\r\n\r\nTryphon was the cause of originating among the Cilicians a piratical\r\nconfederacy. They were induced also to do this by the imbecility of the\r\nkings who succeeded each other on the thrones of Syria and Cilicia. In\r\nconsequence of his introduction of political changes, others imitated\r\nhis example, and the dissensions among brothers exposed the country to\r\nthe attacks of invaders.\r\n\r\nThe exportation of slaves was the chief cause of inducing them to commit\r\ncriminal acts, for this traffic was attended with very great profit, and\r\nthe slaves were easily taken. Delos was at no great distance, a large\r\nand rich mart, capable of receiving and transporting, when sold, the\r\nsame day, ten thousand slaves; so that hence arose a proverbial saying,\r\n\r\n   “Merchant, come into port, discharge your freight—everything\r\n   is sold.”\r\n\r\nThe Romans, having acquired wealth after the destruction of Carthage and\r\nCorinth, employed great numbers of domestic slaves, and were the cause\r\nof this traffic. The pirates, observing the facility with which slaves\r\ncould be procured, issued forth in numbers from all quarters, committing\r\nrobbery and dealing in slaves.\r\n\r\nThe kings of Cyprus and of Egypt, who were enemies of the Syrians,\r\nfavoured their marauding enterprises; the Rhodians were no less hostile\r\nto the Syrians, and therefore afforded the latter no protection. The\r\npirates, therefore, under the pretence of trading in slaves, continued\r\nwithout intermission their invasions and robbery.\r\n\r\nThe Romans paid little attention to the places situated without the\r\nTaurus; they sent, however, Scipio Æmilianus, and afterwards some\r\nothers, to examine the people and the cities. They discovered that the\r\nevils arose from negligence on the part of the sovereigns, but they were\r\nreluctant to deprive the family of Seleucus Nicator of the succession,\r\nin which he had been confirmed by themselves.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason the Parthians, who occupied the parts [CAS. 669]\r\nbeyond the Euphrates, became masters of the country; and lastly the\r\nArmenians, who also gained possession of the country without the Taurus\r\nas far as Phœnicia. They used their utmost to extirpate the power of the\r\nkings and all their descendants, but surrendered the command of the sea\r\nto the Cilicians.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were subsequently compelled to reduce the Cilicians, after\r\ntheir aggrandizement, by war and expeditions, whose progress, however,\r\nand advancement they had not obstructed; yet it would be improper to\r\naccuse the Romans of neglect, because, being engaged with concerns\r\nnearer at hand, they were unable to direct their attention to more\r\ndistant objects.\r\n\r\nI thought proper to make these remarks in a short digression from my\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n3. Next to the Coracesium is the city Syedra;[226] then Hamaxia,[227] a\r\nsmall town upon a hill, with a harbour, to which is brought down timber\r\nfor ship-building; the greatest part of it consists of cedar. This\r\ncountry seems to produce this tree in abundance. It was on this account\r\nthat Antony assigned it to Cleopatra, as being capable of furnishing\r\nmaterials for the construction of her fleet.\r\n\r\nThen follows Laertes a fortress, situated upon the crest of a hill, of a\r\npap-like form; a port belongs to it; next, the city Selinus,[228] then\r\nCragus, a precipitous rock on the sea-coast; then Charadrus[229] a\r\nfortress, which has a port (above it is the mountain Andriclus[230]) and\r\na rocky shore, called Platanistus, next Anemurium[231] a promontory,\r\nwhere the continent approaches nearest to Cyprus, towards the promontory\r\nCrommyum,[232] the passage across being 350 stadia.\r\n\r\nFrom the boundaries of Pamphylia to Anemurium, the voyage along the\r\nCilician coast is 820 stadia; the remainder of it as far as Soli[233] is\r\nabout 500 stadia (1500?). On this coast, after Anemurium, the first city\r\nis Nagidus, then Arsinoë,[234] with a small port; then a place called\r\nMelania,[235] and Celenderis[236] a city, with a harbour.\r\n\r\nSome writers,[237] among whom is Artemidorus, consider this place as\r\nthe commencement of Cilicia, and not Coracesium. He says, that from the\r\nPelusiac mouth to Orthosia are 3900 stadia, and to the river\r\nOrontes[238] 1130 stadia; then to the gates of Cilicia 525 stadia, and\r\nto the borders of Cilicia 1260 stadia.[239]\r\n\r\n4. Next is Holmi,[240] formerly inhabited by the present Seleucians; but\r\nwhen Seleucia on the Calycadnus was built, they removed there. On\r\ndoubling the coast, which forms a promontory called Sarpedon,[241] we\r\nimmediately come to the mouth of the Calycadnus.[242] Zephyrium[243] a\r\npromontory is near the Calycadnus. The river may be ascended as far as\r\nSeleucia, a city well peopled, and the manners of whose inhabitants are\r\nvery different from those of the people of Cilicia and Pamphylia.\r\n\r\nIn our time there flourished at that place remarkable persons of the\r\nPeripatetic sect of philosophers, Athenæus and Xenarchus. The former was\r\nengaged in the administration of the affairs of state in his own\r\ncountry, and for some time espoused the party of the people; he\r\nafterwards contracted a friendship with Murena, with whom he fled, and\r\nwith whom he was captured, on the discovery of the conspiracy against\r\nAugustus Cæsar; but he established his innocence, and was set at liberty\r\nby Cæsar. When he returned from Rome, he addressed the first persons who\r\nsaluted him, and made their inquiries, in the words of Euripides—\r\n\r\n   “I come from the coverts of the dead, and the gates of\r\n   darkness.”[244]\r\n\r\nHe survived his return but a short time, being killed by the fall,\r\nduring the night, of the house in which he lived.\r\n\r\nXenarchus, whose lectures I myself attended, did not long remain at\r\nhome, but taught philosophy at Alexandreia, Athens, and Rome. He enjoyed\r\nthe friendship of Areius, and afterwards of Augustus Cæsar; he lived to\r\nold age, honoured and respected. Shortly before his death he lost his\r\nsight, and died a natural death.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 670] 5. After the Calycadnus, is the rock called Pœcile,[245],\r\nwhich has steps, like those of a ladder, cut in the rock, on the road to\r\nSeleucia. Then follows the promontory Anemurium,[246] of the same name\r\nwith the former, Crambusa an island, and then Corycus[247] a promontory,\r\nabove which, at the distance of 20 stadia, is the Corycian cave, where\r\ngrows the best saffron. It is a large valley of a circular form,\r\nsurrounded by a ridge of rock, of considerable height all round. Upon\r\ndescending into it, the bottom is irregular, and a great part of it\r\nrocky, but abounding with shrubs of the evergreen and cultivated kind.\r\nThere are interspersed spots which produce the saffron. There is also a\r\ncave in which rises a river of pure and transparent water. Immediately\r\nat its source the river buries itself in the ground, and continues its\r\nsubterraneous course till it discharges itself into the sea. The name of\r\n(Pikron Hydor) “bitter water” is given to it.\r\n\r\n6. After Corycus, is the island Elæussa,[248] lying very near the\r\ncontinent. Here Archelaus resided, and built a palace, after having\r\nbecome master of the whole of Cilicia Tracheiotis, except Seleucia, as\r\nAugustus had been before, and as at a still earlier period it was held\r\nby Cleopatra. For as the country was well adapted by nature for robbery\r\nboth by sea and land, (by land, on account of the extent of the\r\nmountains, and the nations situated beyond them, who occupy plains, and\r\nlarge tracts of cultivated country easy to be overrun; by sea, on\r\naccount of the supply of timber for ship-building, the harbours,\r\nfortresses, and places of retreat,) for all these reasons the Romans\r\nthought it preferable that the country should be under the government of\r\nkings, than be subject to Roman governors sent to administer justice,\r\nbut who would not always be on the spot, nor attended by an army. In\r\nthis manner Archelaus obtained possession of Cilicia Tracheia, in\r\naddition to Cappadocia. Its boundaries between Soli and Elæussa are the\r\nriver Lamus,[249] and a village of the same name.[250]\r\n\r\n7. At the extremity of the Taurus is Olympus a mountain,[251] the\r\npiratical hold of Zenicetus, and a fortress of the same name. It\r\ncommands a view of the whole of Lycia, Pamphylia, and Pisidia. When the\r\nmountain was taken by (Servilius) Isauricus, Zenicetus burnt himself,\r\nwith all his household. To this robber belonged Corycus, Phaselis, and\r\nmany strongholds in Pamphylia, all of which were taken by (Servilius)\r\nIsauricus.\r\n\r\n8. Next to Lamus is Soli,[252] a considerable city, where the other\r\nCilicia, that about Issus, commences. It was founded by Achæans, and by\r\nRhodians from Lindus. Pompey the Great transferred to this city, which\r\nhad a scanty population, the survivors of the pirates, whom he thought\r\nmost entitled to protection and clemency, and changed its name to\r\nPompeiopolis.\r\n\r\nChrysippus the Stoic philosopher, the son of an inhabitant of Tarsus,\r\nwho left it to live at Soli; Philemon the comic poet; and Aratus, who\r\ncomposed a poem called “the Phænomena,” were among the illustrious\r\nnatives of this place.\r\n\r\n9. Next follows Zephyrium,[253] of the same name as that near\r\nCalycadnus; then Anchiale, a little above the sea, built by\r\nSardanapalus, according to Aristobulus. (According to the same author)\r\nthe tomb of Sardanapalus is here, and a stone figure representing him\r\nwith the fingers of his right hand brought together as in the act of\r\nsnapping them, and the following inscription in Assyrian letters:\r\n“SARDANAPALUS, THE SON OF ANACYNDARAXES, BUILT ANCHIALE AND TARSUS IN\r\nONE DAY. EAT, DRINK, BE MERRY; EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOT WORTH[4] THAT”—the\r\nsnapping of the fingers.\r\n\r\nChœrilus mentions this inscription, and the following lines are\r\neverywhere known:\r\n\r\n   “Meat and drink, wanton jests, and the delights of love, these\r\n   I have enjoyed; but my great wealth I have left behind.”[254]\r\n\r\n10. Above Anchiale is situated Cyinda a fortress, where the Macedonian\r\nkings formerly kept their treasure. Eumenes, when he revolted from\r\nAntigonus, took it away. Further above this place and Soli, is a\r\nmountainous tract, where is situated Olbe a city, which has a temple of\r\nJupiter, founded by Ajax, son of Teucer. The priest of this temple was\r\nmaster [CAS. 672] of the Tracheiotis. Subsequently many tyrants seized\r\nupon the country, and it became the retreat of robbers. After their\r\nextermination, the country was called, even to our times, the dominion\r\nof Teucer; and the priesthood, the priesthood of Teucer; indeed, most of\r\nthe priests had the name of Teucer, or of Ajax. Aba, the daughter of\r\nXenophanes, one of the tyrants, entered into this family by marriage,\r\nand obtained possession of the government. Her father had previously\r\nadministered it as guardian, but Antony and Cleopatra afterwards\r\nconferred it upon Aba, as a favour, being ultimately prevailed upon to\r\ndo so by her entreaties and attentions. She was afterwards dispossessed,\r\nbut the government remained in the hands of the descendants of her\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nNext to Anchiale are the mouths of the Cydnus[255] at the Rhegma, (the\r\nRent,) as it is called. It is a place like a lake, and has ancient\r\ndockyards; here the Cydnus discharges itself, after flowing through the\r\nmiddle of Tarsus. It rises in the Taurus, which overhangs the city. The\r\nlake is a naval arsenal of Tarsus.\r\n\r\n11. The whole of the sea-coast, beginning from the part opposite to\r\nRhodes, extends to this place in the direction from the western to the\r\neastern point of the equinoctial. It then turns towards the winter\r\nsolstice, as far as Issus, and thence immediately makes a bend to the\r\nsouth to Phœnicia. The remainder towards the west terminates at the\r\npillars (of Hercules).[256]\r\n\r\nThe actual isthmus of the peninsula, which we have described, is that\r\nwhich extends from Tarsus and the mouth of the Cydnus as far as Amisus,\r\nfor this is the shortest distance from Amisus to the boundaries of\r\nCilicia; from these to Tarsus are 120 stadia, and not more from Tarsus\r\nto the mouth of the Cydnus. To Issus, and the sea near it, there is no\r\nshorter road from Amisus than that leading through Tarsus, nor from\r\nTarsus to Issus is there any nearer than that leading to Cydnus; so\r\nthat it is clear, that, in reality, this is the isthmus. Yet it is\r\npretended that the isthmus extending as far as the Bay of Issus is the\r\ntrue isthmus, on account of its presenting remarkable points.\r\n\r\nHence, not aiming at exactness, we say that the line drawn from the\r\ncountry opposite to Rhodes, which we protracted as far as Cydnus, is the\r\nsame as that extending as far as Issus, and that the Taurus extends in a\r\nstraight direction with this line as far as India.\r\n\r\n12. Tarsus is situated in a plain. It was founded by Argives, who\r\naccompanied Triptolemus in his search after Io. The Cydnus flows through\r\nthe middle of it, close by the gymnasium of the young men. As the source\r\nis not far distant, and the stream passing through a deep valley, then\r\nflows immediately into the city, the water is cold and rapid in its\r\ncourse; hence it is of advantage to men and beasts affected with\r\nswellings of the sinews, fluxions, and gout.[257]\r\n\r\n13. The inhabitants of this city apply to the study of philosophy and to\r\nthe whole encyclical compass of learning with so much ardour, that they\r\nsurpass Athens, Alexandreia, and every other place which can be named\r\nwhere there are schools and lectures of philosophers.\r\n\r\nIt differs however so far from other places, that the studious are all\r\nnatives, and strangers are not inclined to resort thither. Even the\r\nnatives themselves do not remain, but travel abroad to complete their\r\nstudies, and having completed them reside in foreign countries. Few of\r\nthem return.\r\n\r\nThe contrary is the case in the other cities which I have mentioned,\r\nexcept Alexandreia; for multitudes repair to them, and reside there with\r\npleasure; but you would observe that few of the natives travel abroad\r\nfrom a love of learning, or show much zeal in the pursuit of it on the\r\nspot. But both these things are to be seen at Alexandreia, a large\r\nnumber of strangers is received, (into their schools,) and not a few of\r\ntheir own countrymen are sent out to foreign countries (to study). They\r\nhave schools of all kinds, for instruction in the liberal arts. In other\r\nrespects Tarsus is well peopled, extremely powerful, and has the\r\ncharacter of being the capital.[258]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 674] 14. The Stoic philosophers Antipater, Archedemus, and Nestor\r\nwere natives of Tarsus: and besides these, the two Athenodori, one of\r\nwhom, Cordylion, lived with Marcus Cato, and died at his house; the\r\nother, the son of Sandon, called Cananites, from some village, was the\r\npreceptor of Cæsar,[259] who conferred on him great honours. In his old\r\nage he returned to his native country, where he dissolved the form of\r\ngovernment existing there, which was unjustly administered by various\r\npersons, and among them by Boëthus, a bad poet and a bad citizen, who\r\nhad acquired great power by courting the favour of the people. Antony\r\ncontributed to increase his importance by having in the first instance\r\ncommended a poem which he had composed on the victory at Philippi; his\r\ninfluence was still augmented by the facility which he possessed (and it\r\nis very general among the inhabitants of Tarsus) of discoursing at great\r\nlength, and without preparation, upon any given subject. Antony also had\r\npromised the people of Tarsus to establish a gymnasium; he appointed\r\nBoëthus chief director of it, and intrusted to him the expenditure of\r\nthe funds. He was detected in secreting, among other things, even the\r\noil, and when charged with this offence by his accusers in the presence\r\nof Antony, he deprecated his anger by this, among other remarks in his\r\nspeech, that as Homer had sung the praises of “Achilles, Agamemnon, and\r\nUlysses, so have I sung yours. I therefore ought not to be brought\r\nbefore you on such a charge.” The accuser answered, “Homer did not steal\r\noil from Agamemnon[260] nor Achilles; but you have stolen it from the\r\ngymnasium, and therefore you shall be punished.” Yet he contrived to\r\navert the displeasure of Antony by courteous offices, and continued to\r\nplunder the city until the death of his protector.\r\n\r\nAthenodorus found the city in this state, and for some time attempted to\r\ncontrol Boëthus and his accomplices by argument; but finding that they\r\ncontinued to commit all kinds of injustice, he exerted the power given\r\nto him by Cæsar, condemned them to banishment, and expelled them. They\r\nhad previously caused to be written upon the walls, “Action for the\r\nyoung, counsel for the middle-aged, discharging wind for the old;” but\r\nAthenodorus, accepting it as a jest, gave orders to inscribe by the side\r\nof it, “Thunder for the old.” Some one, however, in contempt for his\r\ngood manners, having a lax state of body, bespattered the gate and wall\r\nof his house as he passed by it at night. Athenodorus, in an assembly of\r\nthe people, accusing persons of being factiously disposed, said, “We may\r\nperceive the sickly condition of the city, and its bad habit of body,\r\nfrom many circumstances, but particularly from its discharges.”\r\n\r\nThose men were Stoics, but Nestor, of our time, the tutor of Marcellus,\r\nson of Octavia, the sister of Cæsar, was of the Academic sect. He was\r\nalso at the head of the government, having succeeded Athenodorus, and\r\ncontinued to be honoured both by the Roman governors and by the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n15. Among the other philosophers,\r\n\r\n   “Those whom I know, and could in order name,”[261]\r\n\r\nwere Plutiades and Diogenes, who went about from city to city,\r\ninstituting schools of philosophy as the opportunity occurred. Diogenes,\r\nas if inspired by Apollo, composed and rehearsed poems, chiefly of the\r\ntragic kind, upon any subject that was proposed. The grammarians of\r\nTarsus, whose writings we have, were Artemidorus and Diodorus. But the\r\nbest writer of tragedy, among those enumerated in “The Pleiad,” was\r\nDionysides. Rome is best able to inform us what number of learned men\r\nthis city has produced, for it is filled with persons from Tarsus and\r\nAlexandreia.\r\n\r\nSuch then is Tarsus.\r\n\r\n16. After the Cydnus follows the Pyramus,[262] which flows from\r\nCataonia. We have spoken of it before. Artemidorus says, that from\r\nthence to Soli is a voyage in a straight line of 500 stadia. Near the\r\nPyramus is Mallus,[263] situated upon a height; it was founded by\r\nAmphilochus, and Mopsus, the son of Apollo, and Mantus, about whom many\r\nfables are related. I have mentioned them in speaking of Calchas, and of\r\nthe contest between Calchas and Mopsus respecting their skill in\r\ndivination. Some persons, as Sophocles, transfer the scene of this\r\ncontest to Sicily, which, after the custom of tragic poets, they call\r\nPamphylia, as they call Lycia, Caria, and [CAS. 676] Troy and Lydia,\r\nPhrygia. Sophocles, among other writers, says that Calchas died there.\r\nAccording to the fable, the contest did not relate to skill in\r\ndivination only, but also to sovereignty. For it is said, that Mopsus\r\nand Amphilochus, on their return from Troy, founded Mallus; that\r\nAmphilochus afterwards went to Argos, and being dissatisfied with the\r\nstate of affairs there, returned to Mallus, where, being excluded from a\r\nshare in the government, he engaged with Mopsus in single combat. Both\r\nwere killed, but their sepulchres are not in sight of each other. They\r\nare shown at present at Magarsa, near the Pyramus.\r\n\r\nCrates the grammarian was a native of this place, and Panætius is said\r\nto have been his disciple.\r\n\r\n17. Above this coast is situated the Aleïan plain, over which Philotas\r\nconducted Alexander’s cavalry, he himself leading the phalanx from Soli\r\nalong the sea-coast and the territory of Mallus to Issus, against the\r\nforces of Darius. It is said that Alexander performed sacrifices in\r\nhonour of Amphilochus, on account of their common affinity to Argos.\r\nHesiod says that Amphilochus was killed by Apollo at Soli; according to\r\nothers, at the Aleïan plain; and others again say, in Syria, upon his\r\nquitting the Aleïan plain on account of the quarrel.\r\n\r\n18. Mallus is followed by Ægææ, a small town[264] with a shelter for\r\nvessels; then the Amanides Gates, (Gates of Amanus,[265]) with a shelter\r\nfor vessels. At these gates terminates the mountain Amanus,[266] which\r\nextends from the Taurus, and lies above Cilicia towards the east. It was\r\nsuccessively in the possession of several tyrants, who had strongholds;\r\nbut, in our time, Tarcondimotus, who was a man of merit, became master\r\nof all; for his good conduct and bravery, he received from the Romans\r\nthe title of King, and transmitted the succession to his posterity.\r\n\r\n19. Next to Ægææ is Issus, a small town with a shelter for vessels, and\r\na river, the Pinarus.[267] At Issus the battle was fought between\r\nAlexander and Darius. The bay is called the Issic Bay. The city\r\nRhosus[268] is situated upon it, as also the city Myriandrus,\r\nAlexandreia,[269] Nicopolis, Mopsuestia,[270] and the Gates,[271] as\r\nthey are called, which are the boundary between Cilicia and Syria.\r\n\r\nIn Cilicia are the temple of the Sarpedonian Artemis and an oracle.\r\nPersons possessed with divine inspiration deliver the oracles.\r\n\r\n20. After Cilicia, the first Syrian city is Seleucia-in-Pieria;[272]\r\nnear it the river Orontes[273] empties itself. From Seleucia to Soli is\r\na voyage in a straight line of nearly 1000 stadia.\r\n\r\n21. Since the Cilicians of the Troad, whom Homer mentions, are situated\r\nat a great distance from the Cilicians without the Taurus, some writers\r\ndeclare that the leaders of the latter colony were Cilicians of the\r\nTroad, and point to Thebe and Lyrnessus in Pamphylia, places bearing the\r\nsame name as those in the Troad; other authors are of a contrary\r\nopinion, and (considering the Cilicians of the Troad as descendants of\r\nthose from beyond the Taurus) point to an Aleïan plain (in support of\r\ntheir hypothesis).\r\n\r\n22. Having described the parts of the before-mentioned Chersonesus\r\nwithout the Taurus, I must add these particulars.\r\n\r\nApollodorus, in his work on the catalogue of the ships mentioned in\r\nHomer, relates, that all the allies of the Trojans, who came from Asia,\r\ninhabited, according to the poet, the peninsula of which at its\r\nnarrowest part is the isthmus between the innermost recess of the bay at\r\nSinope and Issus. The exterior sides (of this peninsula), which is of a\r\ntriangular shape, are unequal. Of these, one extends from Cilicia to\r\nChelidoniæ, (islands,) another thence to the mouth of the Euxine, and\r\nthe third from the mouth of the Euxine to Sinope.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that the allies were only those who occupied the peninsula\r\nmay be proved to be erroneous by the same arguments by which we before\r\nshowed that those who lived within the Halys were not the only allies.\r\nFor the places about Pharnacia, where we said the Halizoni lived, are\r\nsituated without the Halys, and also without the isthmus, for they\r\n[CAS. 677] are without the line drawn from Sinope to Issus;[274] and\r\nnot only without this line, but also without the true line of the\r\nisthmus drawn from Amisus to Issus; for Apollodorus incorrectly\r\ndescribes the isthmus and the line of its direction, substituting one\r\nline for another (the line drawn from Sinope to Issus for the line drawn\r\nfrom Amisus to Issus).\r\n\r\nBut the greatest absurdity is this, that after having said that the\r\npeninsula was of a triangular shape, he speaks of three _exterior_\r\nsides. For in speaking of _exterior_ sides, he seems to except the line\r\nof the isthmus itself, considering it still a side, although not an\r\n_exterior_ side, from its not being upon the sea. But if this line were\r\nso shortened that the extremities of the (_exterior_) sides falling upon\r\nIssus and Sinope nearly coincided, the peninsula might in that case be\r\nsaid to be of a triangular shape; but as his own line (from Sinope to\r\nIssus) is 3000 stadia in length, it would be ignorance, and not a\r\nknowledge of chorography, to call such a four-sided figure a triangle.\r\nYet he published a work on Chorography, in the metre of comedy, (Iambic\r\nmetre,) entitled “The Circuit of the Earth.”\r\n\r\nHe is still liable to the same charge of ignorance, even if we should\r\nsuppose the isthmus to be contracted to its least dimensions, and follow\r\nwriters who erroneously estimate the distance at one-half of the sum,\r\nnamely 1500 stadia, to which it is reduced by Artemidorus; but even this\r\nwould not by any means reduce the thus contracted space to the figure of\r\na triangle.\r\n\r\nBesides, Artemidorus has not correctly described the exterior sides; one\r\nside, he says, extends from Issus to the Chelidoniæ islands, although\r\nthe whole Lycian coast, and the country opposite to Rhodes as far as\r\nPhyscus, lies in a straight line with, and is a continuation of it; the\r\ncontinent then makes a bend at Physcus, and forms the commencement of\r\nthe second or western side, extending to the Propontis and Byzantium.\r\n\r\n23. Ephorus had said that this peninsula was inhabited by sixteen\r\ntribes, three of which were Grecian, and the rest barbarous, with the\r\nexception of the mixed nations; he placed on the sea-coast Cilicians,\r\nPamphylians, Lycians, Bithynians, Paphlagonians, Mariandyni, Troes, and\r\nCarians; and in the interior, Pisidians, Mysians, Chalybes, Phrygians,\r\nand Milyæ.[275] Apollodorus, when discussing this position, says there\r\nis a seventeenth tribe, the Galatians, who are more recent than the time\r\nof Ephorus; that of the sixteen tribes mentioned, the Greeks were not\r\nsettled (in the peninsula) at the period of the Trojan war, and that\r\ntime has produced great intermixture and confusion among the barbarous\r\nnations. Homer, he continues, recites in his Catalogue the Troes, and\r\nthose now called Paphlagonians, Mysians, Phrygians, Carians, Lycians,\r\nMeionians, instead of Lydians and other unknown people, as Halizoni and\r\nCaucones; nations besides not mentioned in the Catalogue but elsewhere,\r\nas Ceteii, Solymi, the Cilicians from the plain of Thebe, and Leleges.\r\nBut the Pamphylians, Bithynians, Mariandyni, Pisidians, and Chalybes,\r\nMilyæ, and Cappadocians are nowhere mentioned by the poet; some because\r\nthey did not then inhabit these places, and some because they were\r\nsurrounded by other tribes, as Idrieis and Termilæ by Carians, Doliones\r\nand Bebryces by Phrygians.\r\n\r\n24. But Apollodorus does not seem to have carefully examined the\r\nstatements of Ephorus, for he confounds and misrepresents the words of\r\nHomer. He ought first to have inquired of Ephorus why he placed the\r\nChalybes within the peninsula, who were situated at a great distance\r\nfrom Sinope, and Amisus towards the east. Those who describe the isthmus\r\nof this peninsula to be on the line drawn from Issus to the Euxine, lay\r\ndown this line as a sort of meridian line, which some suppose to pass\r\nthrough Sinope, others through Amisus; but no one through the Chalybes,\r\nfor such a line would be altogether an oblique line. For the meridian\r\npassing through the Chalybes, drawn through the Lesser Armenia, and the\r\nEuphrates, would comprise (on the east) the whole of Cappadocia,\r\nCommagene, Mount Amanus, and the Bay of Issus. [CAS. 678] But if we\r\nshould grant (to Ephorus) that this oblique line is the direction of the\r\nisthmus, most of these places, Cappadocia in particular, would be\r\nincluded, and (the kingdom of) Pontus, properly so called, which is a\r\npart of Cappadocia on the Euxine; so that if we were to admit the\r\nChalybes to be a part of the peninsula, with more reason we ought to\r\nadmit the Cataonians, the two nations of Cappadocians, and the\r\nLycaonians, whom even he himself has omitted. But why has he placed in\r\nthe interior the Chalybes, whom the poet, as we have shown, calls\r\nHalizoni? It would have been better to divide them, and to place one\r\nportion of them on the sea-coast, and another in the inland parts. The\r\nsame division ought to be made of the Cappadocians and Cilicians. But\r\nEphorus does not even mention the former, and speaks only of the\r\nCilicians on the sea-coast. The subjects, then, of Antipater of Derbe,\r\nthe Homonadeis, and many other tribes contiguous to the Pisidians,\r\n\r\n   “men, who know not the sea, nor have ever eaten food seasoned\r\n   with salt,”[276]\r\n\r\nwhere are they to be placed? Nor does he say whether the Lydians and the\r\nMeonians are two nations or the same nation, or whether they live\r\nseparately by themselves or are comprehended in another tribe. For it\r\nwas impossible for Ephorus to be ignorant of so celebrated a nation, and\r\ndoes he not, by passing it over in silence, appear to omit a most\r\nimportant fact?\r\n\r\n25. But who are “the mixed nations”? For we cannot say that he either\r\nnamed or omitted others, besides those already mentioned, whom we should\r\ncall mixed nations. Nor, indeed, should we say that they were a part of\r\nthose nations whom he has either mentioned or omitted. For if they were\r\na mixed people, still the majority constituted them either Greeks or\r\nBarbarians. We know nothing of a third mixed people.\r\n\r\n26. But how (according to Ephorus) are there three tribes of Greeks who\r\ninhabit the peninsula? Is it because anciently the Athenians and Ionians\r\nwere the same people? In that case the Dorians and the Æolians should be\r\nconsidered as the same nation, and then there would be (only) two tribes\r\n(and not three, inhabiting the peninsula). But if, following modern\r\npractice, we are to distinguish nations according to dialects, there\r\nwill be four nations, as there are four dialects. But this peninsula is\r\ninhabited, especially if we adopt the division by Ephorus, not only by\r\nIonians, but also by Athenians, as we have shown in the account of each\r\nparticular place.\r\n\r\nIt was worth while to controvert the positions of Ephorus, Apollodorus\r\nhowever disregards all this, and adds a seventeenth to the sixteen\r\nnations, namely, the Galatians; although it is well to mention this, yet\r\nit is not required in a discussion of what Ephorus relates or omits;\r\nApollodorus has assigned as the reason of the omission, that all these\r\nnations settled in the peninsula subsequently to the time of Ephorus.\r\n\r\n27. Passing then to Homer, Apollodorus is correct in saying that there\r\nwas a great intermixture and confusion among the barbarous nations, from\r\nthe Trojan war to the present time, on account of the changes which had\r\ntaken place; for some nations had an accession of others, some were\r\nextinct or dispersed, or had coalesced together.\r\n\r\nBut he is mistaken in assigning two reasons why the poet does not\r\nmention some nations, namely, either because the place was not then\r\noccupied by the particular people, or because they were comprehended in\r\nanother tribe. Neither of these reasons could induce him to be silent\r\nrespecting Cappadocia or Cataonia, or Lycaonia itself, for we have\r\nnothing of the kind in history relating to these countries. It is\r\nridiculous to be anxious to find excuses why Homer has omitted to speak\r\nof Cappadocia [Cataonia] and Lycaonia, and not to inform us why Ephorus\r\nomitted them, particularly as the proposed object of Apollodorus was to\r\nexamine and discuss the opinions of Ephorus; and to tell us why Homer\r\nmentions Mæonians instead of Lydians, and also not to remark that\r\nEphorus has not omitted to mention either Lydians or Mæonians.[277]\r\n\r\n28. Apollodorus remarks, that Homer mentions certain unknown nations,\r\nand he is right in specifying Caucones, Solymi, Ceteii, Leleges, and the\r\nCilicians from the plain of Thebe; but the Halizones are a fiction of\r\nhis own, or rather of those who, not knowing who the Halizones were,\r\nfrequently altered the mode of writing the name, and invented the\r\nexistence of [CAS. 680] mines of silver and of many other mines, all of\r\nwhich are abandoned.\r\n\r\nWith this vain intention they collected the stories related by the\r\nScepsian, (Demetrius,) and taken from Callisthenes and other writers,\r\nwho did not clear them from false notions respecting the Halizones; for\r\nexample, the wealth of Tantalus and of the Pelopidæ was derived, it is\r\nsaid, from the mines about Phrygia and Sipylus; that of Cadmus from the\r\nmines about Thrace and Mount Pangæum; that of Priam from the gold mines\r\nat Astyra, near Abydos (of which at present there are small remains, yet\r\nthere is a large quantity of matter ejected, and the excavations are\r\nproofs of former workings); that of Midas from the mines about Mount\r\nBermium; that of Gyges, Alyattes, and Crœsus, from the mines in Lydia\r\nand the small deserted city between Atarneus and Pergamum, where are the\r\nsites of exhausted mines.[278]\r\n\r\n29. We may impute another fault to Apollodorus, that although he\r\nfrequently censures modern writers for introducing new readings at\r\nvariance with the meaning of Homer, yet in this instance he not only\r\nneglects his own advice, but actually unites together places which are\r\nnot so represented (by Homer).\r\n\r\n(For example), Xanthus the Lydian says, that after the Trojan times the\r\nPhrygians came from Europe (into Asia) and the left (western) side of\r\nthe Euxine, and that their leader Scamandrius conducted them from the\r\nBerecynti and Ascania. Apollodorus adds, that Homer mentions the same\r\nAscania as Xanthus,\r\n\r\n   “Phorcys and the divine Ascanius led the Phrygians from the\r\n   distant Ascania.”[279]\r\n\r\nIf this be so, the migration (from Europe to Asia) must be later than\r\nthe Trojan war; but in the Trojan war the auxiliaries mentioned by the\r\npoet came from the opposite continent, from the Berecynti and Ascania.\r\nWho then were the Phrygians,\r\n\r\n   “who were then encamped on the banks of the Sangarius,”\r\n\r\nwhen Priam says,\r\n\r\n   “And I joined them with these troops as an auxiliary”?[280]\r\n\r\nAnd how came Priam to send for the Phrygians from among the Berecynti,\r\nbetween whom and himself no compact existed, and pass over the people\r\nwho were contiguous to him, and whose ally he formerly had been?\r\n\r\nApollodorus, after having spoken of the Phrygians in this manner,\r\nintroduces an account concerning the Mysians which contradicts this. He\r\nsays that there is a village of Mysia called Ascania, near a lake of the\r\nsame name,[281] out of which issues the river Ascanius, mentioned by\r\nEuphorion:[282]\r\n\r\n   “near the waters of the Mysian Ascanius;”\r\n\r\nand by Alexander of Ætolia:\r\n\r\n   “they who dwell on the stream of Ascanius, on the brink of the\r\n   Ascanian lake, where lived Dolion, the son of Silenus and\r\n   Melia.”\r\n\r\nThe district, he says, about Cyzicus, on the road to Miletopolis, is\r\ncalled Dolionis and Mysia.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, and if it is confirmed by existing places and by\r\nthe poets, what prevented Homer, when he mentioned this Ascania, from\r\nmentioning the Ascania also of which Xanthus speaks?\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of these places in the description of Mysia and\r\nPhrygia, and shall here conclude the discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It remains for me to describe the island Cyprus, which adjoins this\r\npeninsula on the south. I have already said, that the sea comprised\r\nbetween Egypt, Phœnice, Syria, and the remainder of the coast as far as\r\nthat opposite to Rhodes, consists, [CAS. 681] so to say, of the\r\nEgyptian and Pamphylian seas and the sea along the Bay of Issus.\r\n\r\nIn this sea lies the island Cyprus, having its northern side approaching\r\nto Cilicia Tracheia, and here also it approaches nearest to the\r\ncontinent; on the east it is washed by the Bay of Issus, on the west by\r\nthe Pamphylian sea, and on the south by that of Egypt. The latter sea is\r\nconfluent on the west with the Libyan and Carpathian seas. On its\r\nsouthern and eastern parts is Egypt, and the succeeding tract of coast\r\nas far as Seleucia and Issus. On the north is Cyprus, and the Pamphylian\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe Pamphylian sea is bounded on the north by the extremities of Cilicia\r\nTracheia, of Pamphylia, and of Lycia as far as the territory opposite to\r\nRhodes; on the west, by the island of Rhodes; on the east, by the part\r\nof Cyprus near Paphos, and the Acamas; on the south, it unites with the\r\nEgyptian sea.\r\n\r\n2. The circumference of Cyprus is 3420 stadia, including the winding of\r\nthe bays. Its length from Cleides[283] to the Acamas,[284] to a\r\ntraveller on land proceeding from east to west, is 1400 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe Cleides are two small islands lying in front of Cyprus on the\r\neastern side, at the distance of 700 stadia from the Pyramus.[285]\r\n\r\nThe Acamas is a promontory with two paps, and upon it is a large forest.\r\nIt is situated at the western part of the island, but extends towards\r\nthe north, approaching very near Selinus in Cilicia Tracheia, for the\r\npassage across is only 1000 stadia; to Side in Pamphylia the passage is\r\n1600 stadia, and to the Chelidoniæ (islands) 1900 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe figure of the whole island is oblong, and in some places on the\r\nsides, which define its breadth, there are isthmuses.\r\n\r\nWe shall describe the several parts of the island briefly, beginning\r\nfrom the point nearest to the continent.\r\n\r\n3. We have said before, that opposite to Anemyrium, a promontory of\r\nCilicia Tracheia, is the extremity of Cyprus, namely, the promontory of\r\nCrommyon,[286] at the distance of 350 stadia.\r\n\r\nFrom the cape, keeping the island on the right hand, and continent on\r\nthe left, the voyage to the Cleides in a straight line towards north and\r\neast is a distance of 700 stadia.\r\n\r\nIn the interval is the city Lapathus,[287] with a harbour and dockyards;\r\nit was founded by Laconians and Praxander. Opposite to it was Nagidus.\r\nThen follows Aphrodisium;[288] here the island is narrow, for over the\r\nmountains to Salamis[289] are 70 stadia. Next is the sea-beach of the\r\nAchæans; here Teucer, the founder of Salamis in Cyprus, being it is said\r\nbanished by his father Telamon, first disembarked. Then follows the city\r\nCarpasia,[290] with a harbour. It is situated opposite to the promontory\r\nSarpedon.[291] From Carpasia there is a transit across the isthmus of 30\r\nstadia to the Carpasian islands and the southern sea; next are a\r\npromontory and a mountain. The name of the promontory is Olympus, and\r\nupon it is a temple of Venus Acræa, not to be approached nor seen by\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nNear and in front lie the Cleides, and many other islands; next are the\r\nCarpasian islands, and after these Salamis, the birth-place of Aristus\r\nthe historian; then Arsinoë, a city with a harbour; next Leucolla,\r\nanother harbour; then the promontory Pedalium, above which is a hill,\r\nrugged, lofty, and table-shaped, sacred to Venus; to this hill from\r\nCleides are 680 stadia. Then to Citium[292] the navigation along the\r\ncoast is for the greater part difficult and among bays. Citium has a\r\nclose harbour. It is the birth-place of Zeno, the chief of the Stoic\r\nsect, and of Apollonius the physician. Thence to Berytus are 1500\r\nstadia. Next is the city Amathus,[293] and between Citium and Berytus, a\r\nsmall city called Palæa, and a pap-shaped mountain, Olympus; then\r\nfollows Curias,[294] a promontory of a peninsular form, to which from\r\nThroni[295] are 700 stadia; then the city Curium,[296] with a harbour,\r\nfounded by Argives.\r\n\r\nHere we may observe the negligence of the author, whether Hedylus, or\r\nwhoever he was, of the elegiac lines which begin,\r\n\r\n   “We hinds, sacred to Phœbus, hither came in our swift course;\r\n   we traversed the broad sea, to avoid the arrows of our\r\n   pursuers.”\r\n\r\nHe says, that the hinds ran down from the Corycian heights, [CAS. 683]\r\nand swam across from the Cilician coast to the beach near Curias, and\r\nadds,\r\n\r\n   “That it was a cause of vast surprise to men to think how we\r\n   scoured the trackless waves, aided by the vernal Zephyrs.”\r\n\r\nFor it is possible (by doubling the cape) to sail round from Corycus to\r\nthe beach of Curias, but not with the assistance of the west wind, nor\r\nby keeping the island on the right, but on the left hand; and there is\r\nno (direct) passage across.\r\n\r\nAt Curium is the commencement of the voyage towards the west in the\r\ndirection of Rhodes; then immediately follows a promontory, whence those\r\nwho touch with their hands the altar of Apollo are precipitated. Next\r\nare Treta,[297] Boosura,[298] and Palæpaphus, situated about 10 stadia\r\nfrom the sea, with a harbour and an ancient temple of the Paphian Venus;\r\nthen follows Zephyria,[299] a promontory with an anchorage, and another\r\nArsinoë, which also has an anchorage, a temple, and a grove. At a little\r\ndistance from the sea is Hierocepis.[300] Next is Paphos, founded by\r\nAgapenor, with a harbour and temples, which are fine buildings. It is\r\ndistant from Palæpaphus 60 stadia by land. Along this road the annual\r\nsacred processions are conducted, when a great concourse both of men and\r\nwomen resort thither from other cities. Some writers say, that from\r\nPaphos to Alexandreia are 3600 stadia. Next after Paphos is the Acamas;\r\nthen after the Acamas the voyage is easterly to Arsinoë a city, and to\r\nthe grove of Jupiter; then Soli[301] a city, where there is a harbour, a\r\nriver, and a temple of Venus and Isis. It was founded by Phalerus and\r\nAcamas, who were Athenians. The inhabitants are called Solii. Stasanor,\r\none of the companions of Alexander, was a native of Soli, and was\r\nhonoured with a chief command. Above Soli in the interior is Limenia a\r\ncity, then follows the promontory of Crommyon.\r\n\r\n4. But why should we be surprised at poets, and those particularly who\r\nstudy modes of expression only, when we compare them with Damastes? The\r\nlatter gives the length of the island from north to south, from\r\nHierocepia, as he says, to Cleides.\r\n\r\nNor does even Eratosthenes give it exactly. For, when he censures\r\nDamastes, he says that Hierocepia is not on the north, but on the south.\r\nYet neither is it on the south, but the west, since it lies on the\r\nwestern side, where are situated Paphos and Acamas.\r\n\r\nSuch then is the position of Cyprus.\r\n\r\n5. It is not inferior in fertility to any one of the islands, for it\r\nproduces good wine and oil, and sufficient corn to supply the wants of\r\nthe inhabitants. At Tamassus there are abundant mines of copper, in\r\nwhich the calcanthus is found, and rust of copper, useful for its\r\nmedicinal properties.\r\n\r\nEratosthenes says, that anciently the plains abounded with timber, and\r\nwere covered with forests, which prevented cultivation; the mines were\r\nof some service towards clearing the surface, for trees were cut down to\r\nsmelt the copper and silver. Besides this, timber was required for the\r\nconstruction of fleets, as the sea was now navigated with security and\r\nby a large naval force; but when even these means were insufficient to\r\ncheck the growth of timber in the forests, permission was given to such\r\nas were able and inclined, to cut down the trees and to hold the land\r\nthus cleared as their own property, free from all payments.\r\n\r\n6. Formerly the Cyprian cities were governed by tyrants, but from the\r\ntime that the Ptolemaïc kings were masters of Egypt, Cyprus also came\r\ninto their power, the Romans frequently affording them assistance. But\r\nwhen the last Ptolemy that was king, brother of the father of Cleopatra,\r\nthe queen of Egypt in our time, had conducted himself in a disorderly\r\nmanner, and was ungrateful to his benefactors, he was deposed, and the\r\nRomans took possession of the island, which became a Prætorian province\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\nThe chief author of the deposition of the king was Pub. Claudius\r\nPulcher, who having fallen into the hands of the Cilician pirates, at\r\nthat time at the height of their power, and a ransom being demanded of\r\nhim, despatched a message to the king, entreating him to send it for his\r\nrelease. The king sent a ransom, but of so small an amount, that the\r\npirates disdained to accept it, and returned it, but they dismissed\r\nPulcher without any payment. After his escape, he remembered what he\r\nowed to both parties; and when he became tribune of the people, he had\r\nsufficient influence to have Marcus [CAS. 684] Cato sent to deprive the\r\nking of the possession of Cyprus. The latter put himself to death before\r\nthe arrival of Cato, who, coming soon afterwards, took possession of\r\nCyprus, sold the king’s property, and conveyed the money to the public\r\ntreasury of the Romans.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the island became, as it is at present, a Prætorian\r\nprovince. During a short intervening period Antony had given it to\r\nCleopatra and her sister Arsinoë, but upon his death all his\r\narrangements were annulled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XV.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Fifteenth Book contains India and Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The parts of Asia which remain to be described are those without the\r\nTaurus, except Cilicia, Pamphylia, and Lycia; extending from India to\r\nthe Nile, and situated between the Taurus and the exterior Southern\r\nSea.[302]\r\n\r\nNext to Asia is Africa, which I shall describe hereafter. At present I\r\nshall begin from India, the first and the largest country situated\r\ntowards the east.\r\n\r\n2. The reader must receive the account of this country with indulgence,\r\nfor it lies at a very great distance, and few persons of our nation have\r\nseen it; those also who have visited it have seen only some portions of\r\nit; the greater part of what they relate is from report, and even what\r\nthey saw, they became acquainted with during their passage through the\r\ncountry with an army, and in great haste. For this reason they do not\r\nagree in their accounts of the same things, although they write about\r\nthem as if they had examined them with the greatest care and attention.\r\nSome of these writers were fellow-soldiers and fellow-travellers, as\r\nthose who belonged to the army which, under the command of Alexander,\r\nconquered Asia; yet they frequently contradict each other. If, then,\r\nthey differ so much respecting things which they had seen, what must we\r\nthink of what they relate from report?\r\n\r\n3. Nor do the writers who, many ages since Alexander’s time, have given\r\nan account of these countries, nor even those who at present make\r\nvoyages thither, afford any precise information.\r\n\r\nApollodorus, for instance, author of the Parthian History, when he\r\nmentions the Greeks who occasioned the revolt of Bactriana from the\r\nSyrian kings, who were the successors of [CAS. 686] Seleucus Nicator,\r\nsays, that when they became powerful they invaded India. He adds no\r\ndiscoveries to what was previously known, and even asserts, in\r\ncontradiction to others, that the Bactrians had subjected to their\r\ndominion a larger portion of India than the Macedonians; for Eucratidas\r\n(one of these kings) had a thousand cities subject to his authority. But\r\nother writers affirm that the Macedonians conquered nine nations\r\nsituated between the Hydaspes[303] and the Hypanis,[304] and obtained\r\npossession of five hundred cities, not one of which was less than Cos\r\nMeropis,[305] and that Alexander, after having conquered all this\r\ncountry, delivered it up to Porus.\r\n\r\n4. Very few of the merchants who now sail from Egypt by the Nile and the\r\nArabian Gulf to India have proceeded as far as the Ganges; and, being\r\nignorant persons, were not qualified to give an account of places they\r\nhave visited. From one place in India, and from one king, namely,\r\nPandion, or, according to others,[306] Porus, presents and embassies\r\nwere sent to Augustus Cæsar. With the ambassadors came the Indian\r\nGymno-Sophist, who committed himself to the flames at Athens,[307] like\r\nCalanus, who exhibited the same spectacle in the presence of Alexander.\r\n\r\n5. If, then, we set aside these stories, and direct our attention to\r\naccounts of the country prior to the expedition of Alexander, we shall\r\nfind them still more obscure. It is probable that Alexander, elated by\r\nhis extraordinary good fortune, believed these accounts.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nearchus, Alexander was ambitious of conducting his army\r\nthrough Gedrosia,[308] when he heard that Semiramis and Cyrus had\r\nundertaken expeditions against India (through this country), although\r\nboth had abandoned the enterprise, the former escaping with twenty, and\r\nCyrus with seven men only. For he considered that it would be a glorious\r\nachievement for him to lead a conquering army safe through the same\r\nnations and countries where Semiramis and Cyrus had suffered such\r\ndisasters. Alexander, therefore, believed these stories.\r\n\r\n6. But how can we place any just confidence in the accounts of India\r\nderived from such expeditions as those of Cyrus and Semiramis?\r\nMegasthenes concurs in this opinion; he advises persons not to credit\r\nthe ancient histories of India, for, except the expeditions of Hercules,\r\nof Bacchus, and the later invasion of Alexander, no army was ever sent\r\nout of their country by the Indians, nor did any foreign enemy ever\r\ninvade or conquer it. Sesostris the Egyptian (he says), and Tearco the\r\nEthiopian, advanced as far as Europe; and Nabocodrosor, who was more\r\ncelebrated among the Chaldæans than Hercules among the Greeks,\r\npenetrated even as far as the Pillars,[309] which Tearco also reached;\r\nSesostris conducted an army from Iberia to Thrace and Pontus;\r\nIdanthyrsus the Scythian overran Asia as far as Egypt; but not one of\r\nthese persons proceeded as far as India, and Semiramis died before her\r\nintended enterprise was undertaken. The Persians had sent for the\r\nHydraces[310] from India, a body of mercenary troops; but they did not\r\nlead an army into that country, and only approached it when Cyrus was\r\nmarching against the Massagetæ.\r\n\r\n7. Megasthenes, and a few others, think the stories respecting Hercules\r\nand Bacchus to be credible, but the majority of writers, among whom is\r\nEratosthenes, regard them as incredible and fabulous, like the Grecian\r\nstories. Dionysus, in the Bacchæ of Euripides, makes this boasting\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n[CAS. 687] “But now from Lydia’s field, With gold abounding, from the\r\nPhrygian realm And that of Persia scorch’d by torrid suns, Pressing\r\nthrough Bactrian gates, the frozen land Of Media, and through Araby the\r\nBlest, With Asia’s wide extended continent——”[311]\r\n\r\nIn Sophocles, also, a person is introduced speaking the praises of\r\nNysa,[312] as being a mountain sacred to Bacchus:\r\n\r\n   “whence I beheld the famed Nysa, the resort of the\r\n   Bacchanalian bands, which the horned Iacchus makes his most\r\n   pleasant and beloved retreat, where no bird’s clang is heard,”\r\n\r\nand so on. [He is called also Merotraphes.][313]\r\n\r\nHomer also mentions Lycurgus the Edonian in these words,\r\n\r\n   “who formerly pursued the nurses of the infuriate Bacchus\r\n   along the sacred mountain Nysa.”[314]\r\n\r\nSo much respecting Bacchus. But with regard to Hercules, some persons\r\nsay, that he penetrated to the opposite extremities on the west only,\r\nwhile others maintain that he also advanced to those of the east.\r\n\r\n8. From such stories as those related above, they gave the name of\r\nNysæans to some imaginary nation, and called their city Nysa, founded by\r\nBacchus; a mountain above the city they called Meron, alleging as a\r\nreason for imposing these names that the ivy and vine grow there,\r\nalthough the latter does not perfect its fruit; for the bunches of\r\ngrapes, in consequence of excessive rains, drop off before they arrive\r\nat maturity.\r\n\r\nThey say, also, that the Sydracæ (Oxydracæ) are descendants of Bacchus,\r\nbecause the vine grows in their country, and because their kings display\r\ngreat pomp in setting out on their warlike expeditions, after the\r\nBacchic manner; whenever they appear in public, it is with beating of\r\ndrums, and are dressed in flowered robes, which is the common custom\r\namong the other Indians.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander took, on the first assault, Aornos,[315] a fortress on a\r\nrock, the foot of which is washed by the Indus near its source, his\r\nflatterers exaggerated this act, and said that Hercules thrice assailed\r\nthis rock and was thrice repulsed.\r\n\r\nThey pretended that the Sibæ[316] were descended from the people who\r\naccompanied Hercules in his expedition, and that they retained badges of\r\ntheir descent; that they wore skins like Hercules, and carried clubs,\r\nand branded with the mark of a club their oxen and mules. They confirm\r\nthis fable with stories about Caucasus[317] and Prometheus, for they\r\ntransferred hither from Pontus these tales, on the slight pretence that\r\nthey had seen a sacred cave among the Paropamisadæ.[318] This they\r\nalleged was the prison of Prometheus, that Hercules came hither to\r\nrelease Prometheus, and that this mountain was the Caucasus, to which\r\nthe Greeks represent Prometheus as having been bound.\r\n\r\n9. That these are the inventions of the flatterers of Alexander is\r\nevident, first, because the writers do not agree with one another, some\r\nof whom speak of these things; others make no mention of them whatever.\r\nFor it is not probable, that actions so illustrious, and calculated to\r\nfoster pride and vanity, should be unknown, or if known, that they\r\nshould not be thought worthy of record, especially by writers of the\r\ngreatest credit.\r\n\r\nBesides, the intervening people, through whose country the armies of\r\nBacchus and Hercules must have marched in their [CAS. 688] way to\r\nIndia, do not exhibit any proofs of their passage through the country.\r\nThe kind of dress, too, of Hercules is much more recent than the\r\nmemorials of Troy, an invention of those who composed the Heracleia (or\r\nexploits of Hercules,) whether it were Peisander or some one else who\r\ncomposed it. But the ancient wooden statues do not represent Hercules in\r\nthat attire.\r\n\r\n10. Under such circumstances, therefore, we must receive everything that\r\napproaches nearest to probability. I have already discussed this subject\r\nto the extent of my ability at the beginning of this work;[319] I shall\r\nnow assume those opinions as clearly proved, and shall add whatever may\r\nseem to be required for the sake of perspicuity.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from the former discussion, that in the summary given by\r\nEratosthenes, in the third book of his Geography, is contained the most\r\ncredible account of the country considered as India at the time of its\r\ninvasion by Alexander.\r\n\r\nAt that period the Indus was the boundary of India and of Ariana,[320]\r\nsituated towards the west, and in the possession of the Persians, for\r\nafterwards the Indians occupied a larger portion of Ariana, which they\r\nhad received from the Macedonians.\r\n\r\nThe account of Eratosthenes is as follows:—\r\n\r\n11. The boundaries of India, on the north, from Ariana to the Eastern\r\nSea,[321] are the extremities of Taurus, to the several parts of which\r\nthe natives give, besides others, the names of Paropamisus, Emodus, and\r\nImaus,[322] but the Macedonians call them Caucasus; on the west, the\r\nriver Indus; the southern and eastern sides, which are much larger than\r\nthe others, project towards the Atlantic Sea, and the figure of the\r\ncountry becomes rhomboïdal,[323] each of the greater sides exceeding\r\nthe opposite by 3000 stadia; and this is the extent of the extremity,\r\ncommon to the eastern and southern coast, and which projects beyond the\r\nrest of that coast equally on the east and south.\r\n\r\nThe western side, from the Caucasian mountains to the Southern Sea, is\r\nestimated at 13,000 stadia, along the river Indus to its mouth;\r\nwherefore the eastern side opposite, with the addition of the 3000\r\nstadia of the promontory, will be 16,000 stadia in extent. This is both\r\nthe smallest and greatest breadth of India.[324] The length is reckoned\r\nfrom west to east. The part of this extending (from the Indus) as far as\r\nPalibothra[325] we may describe more confidently; for it has been\r\nmeasured by Schœni,[326] and is a royal road of 10,000 stadia. The\r\nextent of the parts beyond depends upon conjecture derived from the\r\nascent of vessels from the sea by the Ganges to Palibothra. This may be\r\nestimated at 6000 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe whole, on the shortest computation, will amount to 16,000 stadia,\r\naccording to Eratosthenes, who says that he took it from the register of\r\nthe Stathmi (or the several stages from place to place),[327] which was\r\nreceived as authentic, and Megasthenes agrees with him. But Patrocles\r\nsays, that the sum of the whole is less by 1000 stadia. If again we add\r\nto this [CAS. 689] distance the extent of the extremity which advances\r\nfar towards the east, the greatest length of India will be 3000 stadia;\r\nthis length is reckoned from the mouths of the river Indus along the\r\ncoast, in a line with the mouths to the above-mentioned extremity and\r\nits eastern limits. Here the people called Coniaci[328] live.\r\n\r\n12. From what has been said, we may perceive how the opinions of the\r\nother writers differ from one another. Ctesias says that India is not\r\nless than the rest of Asia; Onesicritus regards it as the third part of\r\nthe habitable world; Nearchus says that it is a march of four months\r\nthrough the plain only. The computations of Megasthenes and Deïmachus\r\nare more moderate, for they estimate the distance from the Southern Sea\r\nto Caucasus[329] at above 20,000 stadia. Deïmachus says that in some\r\nplaces it exceeds 30,000 stadia.\r\n\r\nWe have replied to these writers in the early part of this work.[330] At\r\npresent it is sufficient to say that these opinions are in favour of the\r\nwriters who, in describing India, solicit indulgence if they do not\r\nadvance anything with confidence.\r\n\r\n13. The whole of India is watered by rivers, some of which empty\r\nthemselves into the two largest, the Indus and the Ganges; others\r\ndischarge themselves into the sea by their own mouths. But all of them\r\nhave their sources in the Caucasus. At their commencement their course\r\nis towards the south; some of them continue to flow in the same\r\ndirection, particularly those which unite with the Indus; others turn to\r\nthe east, as the Ganges. This, the largest of the Indian rivers,\r\ndescends from the mountainous country, and when it reaches the plains,\r\nturns to the east, then flowing past Palibothra, a very large city,\r\nproceeds onwards to the sea in that quarter, and discharges its waters\r\nby a single mouth. The Indus falls into the Southern Sea, and empties\r\nitself by two mouths, encompassing the country called Patalene, which\r\nresembles the Delta of Egypt.\r\n\r\nBy the exhalation of vapours from such vast rivers, and by the Etesian\r\nwinds, India, as Eratosthenes affirms, is watered by summer rains, and\r\nthe plains are overflowed. During the rainy season flax,[331] millet,\r\nsesamum, rice, and bosmorum[332] are sowed; and in the winter season,\r\nwheat, barley, pulse, and other esculent fruits of the earth with which\r\nwe are not acquainted. Nearly the same animals are bred in India as in\r\nEthiopia and Egypt, and the rivers of India produce all the animals of\r\nthose countries, except the hippopotamus, although Onesicritus asserts\r\nthat even this animal is found in them.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the south resemble the Ethiopians in colour, but\r\ntheir countenances and hair are like those of other people. Their hair\r\ndoes not curl, on account of the humidity of the atmosphere. The\r\ninhabitants of the north resemble the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n14. Taprobane[333] is said to be an island, lying out at sea, distant\r\nfrom the most southerly parts of India, which are opposite the Coniaci,\r\nseven days’[334] sail towards the south. Its length is about 8000 stadia\r\nin the direction of Ethiopia.[335] It produces elephants.\r\n\r\nThis is the account of Eratosthenes. The accounts of other writers, in\r\naddition to this, whenever they convey exact information, will\r\ncontribute to form the description[336] (of India).\r\n\r\n15. Onesicritus, for example, says of Taprobane, that its magnitude is\r\n5000 stadia, without distinction of length or breadth, and that it is\r\ndistant twenty days’ sail from the continent, but that it was a voyage\r\nperformed with difficulty and danger by vessels with sails ill\r\nconstructed, and built with prows at each end, but without holds and\r\nkeels;[337] that there are other islands between this and India, but\r\nthat Taprobane lies farthest to the south; that there are found in the\r\nsea, about the island, animals of the cetaceous kind, in form like oxen,\r\nhorses, and other land-animals.\r\n\r\n16. Nearchus, speaking of the accretion of earth formed [CAS. 691] by\r\nthe rivers, adduces these instances. The plains of Hermes, Caÿster,\r\nMæander, and Caïcus have these names, because they have been formed by\r\nthe soil which has been carried over the plains by the rivers; or rather\r\nthey were produced by the fine and soft soil brought down from the\r\nmountains; whence the plains are, as it were, the offspring of the\r\nrivers, and it is rightly said, that the plains belong to the rivers.\r\nWhat is said by Herodotus[338] of the Nile, and of the land about it,\r\nmay be applied to this country, namely, that it is the gift of the Nile.\r\nHence Nearchus thinks that the Nile had properly the synonym of Egypt.\r\n\r\n17. Aristobulus, however, says, that rain and snow fall only on the\r\nmountains and the country immediately below them, and that the plains\r\nexperience neither one nor the other, but are overflowed only by the\r\nrise of the waters of the rivers; that the mountains are covered with\r\nsnow in the winter; that the rains set in at the commencement of spring,\r\nand continue to increase; that at the time of the blowing of the Etesian\r\nwinds they pour down impetuously, without intermission, night and day\r\ntill the rising of Arcturus,[339] and that the rivers, filled by the\r\nmelting of the snow and by the rains, irrigate the flat grounds.\r\n\r\nThese things, he says, were observed by himself and by others on their\r\njourney into India from the Paropamisadæ. This was after the setting of\r\nthe Pleiades,[340] and during their stay in the mountainous country in\r\nthe territory of the Hypasii, and in that of Assacanus during the\r\nwinter. At the beginning of spring they descended into the plains to a\r\nlarge city called Taxila,[341] thence they proceeded to the Hydaspes and\r\nthe country of Porus. During the winter they saw no rain, but only snow.\r\nThe first rain which fell was at Taxila. After their descent to the\r\nHydaspes and the conquest of Porus, their progress was eastwards to the\r\nHypanis, and thence again to the Hydaspes. At this time it rained\r\ncontinually, and particularly during the blowing of the Etesian winds,\r\nbut at the rising of Arcturus the rains ceased. They remained at the\r\nHydaspes while the ships were constructing, and began their voyage not\r\nmany days before the setting of the Pleiades, and were occupied during\r\nthe whole autumn, winter, and the ensuing spring and summer, in sailing\r\ndown the river, and arrived at Patalene[342] about the rising of the\r\nDog-Star;[343] during the passage down the river, which lasted ten\r\nmonths, they did not experience rain at any place, not even when the\r\nEtesian winds were at their height, when the rivers were full and the\r\nplains overflowed; the sea could not be navigated on account of the\r\nblowing of contrary winds, but no land breezes succeeded.\r\n\r\n18. Nearchus gives the same account, but does not agree with Aristobulus\r\nrespecting the rains in summer, but says that the plains are watered by\r\nrain in the summer, and that they are without rain in winter. Both\r\nwriters, however, speak of the rise of the rivers. Nearchus says, that\r\nthe men encamped upon the Acesines[344] were obliged to change their\r\nsituation for another more elevated, and that this was at the time of\r\nthe rise of the river, and of the summer solstice.\r\n\r\nAristobulus gives even the measure of the height to which the river\r\nrises, namely, forty cubits, of which twenty would fill the channel\r\nbeyond its previous depth up to the margin, and the other twenty are the\r\nmeasure of the water when it overflows the plains.\r\n\r\nThey agree also in saying that the cities placed upon mounds become\r\nislands, as in Egypt and Ethiopia, and that the inundation ceases after\r\nthe rising of Arcturus, when the waters recede. They add, that the\r\nground when half dried is sowed, after having been prepared by the\r\ncommonest labourer, yet the plant comes to perfection, and the produce\r\nis good. The rice, according to Aristobulus, stands in water in an\r\nenclosure. It is sowed in beds. The plant is four cubits in height, with\r\nmany ears, and yields a large produce. The harvest is about the time of\r\nthe setting of the Pleiades, and the grain is beaten out like barley. It\r\ngrows in Bactriana, Babylonia, Susis, and in the Lower Syria. Megillus\r\nsays that it is sowed before the rains, but does not require irrigation\r\nor transplantation, being supplied with water from tanks.\r\n\r\nThe bosmorum, according to Onesicritus, is a kind of corn smaller than\r\nwheat, and grows in places situated between [CAS. 692] rivers. After it\r\nis threshed out, it is roasted; the threshers being previously bound by\r\nan oath not to carry it away unroasted from the threshing floor; a\r\nprecaution to prevent the exportation of the seed.\r\n\r\n19. Aristobulus, when comparing the circumstances in which this country\r\nresembles, and those in which it differs from, Egypt and Ethiopia, and\r\nobserving that the swelling of the Nile is occasioned by rains in the\r\nsouth, and of the Indian rivers by rains from the north, inquires why\r\nthe intermediate places have no rain; for it does not rain in the\r\nThebaïs as far as Syene, nor at the places near Meroë, nor in the parts\r\nof India from Patalene to the Hydaspes. But the country situated above\r\nthese parts,[345] in which both rain and snow occur, is cultivated by\r\nthe husbandman in the same manner as the country without India; for the\r\nrain and the snow supply the ground with moisture.\r\n\r\nIt is probable from what he relates that the country is subject to\r\nshocks of earthquakes, that the ground is loose and hollow by excess of\r\nmoisture, and easily splits into fissures, whence even the course of\r\nrivers is altered.\r\n\r\nHe says that when he was despatched upon some business into the country,\r\nhe saw a tract of land deserted, which contained more than a thousand\r\ncities with their dependent villages; the Indus, having left its proper\r\nchannel, was diverted into another, on the left hand, much deeper, and\r\nprecipitated itself into it like a cataract, so that it no longer\r\nwatered the country by the (usual) inundation on the right hand, from\r\nwhich it had receded, and this was elevated above the level, not only of\r\nthe new channel of the river, but above that of the (new) inundation.\r\n\r\n20. The account of Onesicritus confirms the facts of the rising of the\r\nrivers and of the absence of land breezes. He says that the sea-shore is\r\nswampy, particularly near the mouths of rivers, on account of the mud,\r\ntides, and the force of the winds blowing from the sea.\r\n\r\nMegasthenes also indicates the fertility of India by the circumstance of\r\nthe soil producing fruits and grain twice a year. Eratosthenes relates\r\nthe same facts, for he speaks of a winter and a summer sowing, and of\r\nthe rain at the same seasons. For there is no year, according to him,\r\nwhich is without rain at both those periods, whence ensues great\r\nabundance, the ground never failing to bear crops.\r\n\r\nAn abundance of fruit is produced by trees; and the roots of plants,\r\nparticularly of large reeds, possess a sweetness, which they have by\r\nnature and by coction; for the water, both from rains and rivers, is\r\nwarmed by the sun’s rays. The meaning of Eratosthenes seems to be this,\r\nthat what among other nations is called the ripening of fruits and\r\njuices, is called among these _coction_, and which contributes as much\r\nto produce an agreeable flavour as the coction by fire. To this is\r\nattributed the flexibility of the branches of trees, from which wheels\r\nof carriages are made, and to the same cause is imputed the growth upon\r\nsome trees of wool.[346] Nearchus says that their fine clothes were made\r\nof this wool, and that the Macedonians used it for mattresses and the\r\nstuffing of saddles. The Serica[347] also are of a similar kind, and are\r\nmade of dry byssus, which is obtained from some sort of bark of plants.\r\nHe says that reeds[348] yield honey, although there are no bees, and\r\nthat there is a tree from the fruit of which honey is procured, but that\r\nthe fruit eaten fresh causes intoxication.\r\n\r\n21. India produces many singular trees. There is one whose branches\r\nincline downwards, and whose leaves are not less in size than a shield.\r\nOnesicritus, describing minutely the country of Musicanus, which he says\r\nis the most southerly part[349] of India, relates, that there are some\r\nlarge trees the branches of which extend to the length even of twelve\r\ncubits. They then grow downwards, as though bent (by force), till they\r\ntouch the earth, where they penetrate and take root like layers. They\r\nnext shoot upwards and form a trunk. They again grow as we have\r\ndescribed, bending downwards, and implanting one layer after another,\r\nand in the above order, so that one tree forms a long shady roof, like a\r\ntent, supported by many pillars. In speaking of the size of the trees,\r\nhe says their trunks could scarcely be clasped by five men.[350]\r\n\r\nAristobulus also, where he mentions the Acesines, and its confluence\r\nwith the Hyarotis, speaks of trees with their boughs bent downwards and\r\nof a size that fifty, but, according [CAS. 694] to Onesicritus, four\r\nhundred horsemen might take shelter at mid-day beneath the shade of a\r\nsingle tree.\r\n\r\nAristobulus mentions another tree, not large, bearing great pods, like\r\nthe bean, ten fingers in length, full of honey,[351] and says that those\r\nwho eat it do not easily escape with life. But the accounts of all these\r\nwriters about the size of the trees have been exceeded by those who\r\nassert that there has been seen, beyond the Hyarotis,[352] a tree which\r\ncasts a shade at noon of five stadia.\r\n\r\nAristobulus says of the wool-bearing trees, that the flower pod contains\r\na kernel, which is taken out, and the remainder is combed like wool.\r\n\r\n22. In the country of Musicanus there grows, he says, spontaneously\r\ngrain resembling wheat, and a vine that produces wine, whereas other\r\nauthors affirm that there is no wine in India. Hence, according to\r\nAnacharsis, they had no pipes, nor any musical instruments, except\r\ncymbals, drums, and crotala, which were used by jugglers.\r\n\r\nBoth Aristobulus and other writers relate that India produces many\r\nmedicinal plants and roots, both of a salutary and noxious quality, and\r\nplants yielding a variety of colours. He adds, that, by a law, any\r\nperson discovering a deadly substance is punished with death unless he\r\nalso discover an antidote; in case he discovers an antidote, he is\r\nrewarded by the king.\r\n\r\nSouthern India, like Arabia and Ethiopia, produces cinnamon, nard, and\r\nother aromatics. It resembles these countries as regards the effect of\r\nthe sun’s rays, but it surpasses them in having a copious supply of\r\nwater, whence the atmosphere is humid, and on this account more\r\nconducive to fertility and fecundity; and this applies to the earth and\r\nto the water, hence those animals which inhabit both one and the other\r\nare of a larger size than are found in other countries. The Nile\r\ncontributes to fecundity more than other rivers, and among other animals\r\nof large bulk, produces the amphibious kind. The Egyptian women also\r\nsometimes have four children at a birth, and Aristotle says that one\r\nwoman had seven children at one birth.[353] He calls the Nile most\r\nfecundating and nutritive, on account of the moderate coction effected\r\nby the sun’s rays, which leave behind the nutritious part of substances,\r\nand evaporate that which is superfluous.\r\n\r\n23. It is perhaps owing to this cause that the water of the Nile boils,\r\nas he says, with one half of the heat which other water requires. In\r\nproportion however, he says, as the water of the Nile traverses in a\r\nstraight line, a long and narrow tract of country, passing through a\r\nvariety of climates and of atmosphere, while the Indian rivers are\r\npoured forth into wider and more extensive plains, their course being\r\ndelayed a long time in the same climate, in the same degree the waters\r\nof India are more nutritious than those of the Nile; they produce larger\r\nanimals of the cetaceous kind, and in greater number (than the Nile),\r\nand the water which descends from the clouds has already undergone the\r\nprocess of coction.\r\n\r\n24. This would not be admitted by the followers of Aristobulus, who say\r\nthat the plains are not watered by rain. Onesicritus, however, thinks\r\nthat rain-water is the cause of the peculiar properties of animals, and\r\nalleges in proof, that the colour of foreign herds which drink of it is\r\nchanged to that of the native animals.\r\n\r\nThis is a just remark; but it is not proper to attribute to the power of\r\nthe water merely the cause of the black complexion and the woolly hair\r\nof the Ethiopians, and yet he censures Theodectes, who refers these\r\npeculiarities to the effects of the sun, in these words,\r\n\r\n   “Near these approaching with his radiant car,\r\n    The sun their skins with dusky tint doth dye,\r\n    And sooty hue; and with unvarying forms\r\n    Of fire, crisps their tufted hair.”\r\n\r\nThere may be reason in this, for he says that the sun does not approach\r\nnearer to the Ethiopians than to other nations, but shines more\r\nperpendicularly, and that on this account the heat is greater; indeed,\r\nit cannot be correctly said that the sun approaches near to the\r\nEthiopians, for he is at an equal distance from all nations. Nor is the\r\nheat the cause of the black complexion, particularly of children in the\r\nwomb, who are out of the reach of the sun. Their opinion is to be\r\npreferred, who attribute these effects to the sun and to intense solar\r\nheat, causing a great deficiency of moisture on the surface [CAS. 696]\r\nof the skin. Hence we say it is that the Indians have not woolly hair,\r\nnor is their colour so intensely[354] dark, because they live in a humid\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nWith respect to children in the womb, they resemble their parents (in\r\ncolour) according to a seminal disposition and constitution, on the same\r\nprinciple that hereditary diseases, and other likenesses, are explained.\r\n\r\nThe equal distance of the sun from all nations (according to\r\nOnesicritus) is an argument addressed to the senses, and not to reason.\r\nBut it is not an argument addressed to the senses generally, but in the\r\nmeaning that the earth bears the proportion of a point to the sun, for\r\nwe may understand such a meaning of an argument addressed to the senses,\r\nby which we estimate heat to be more or less, as it is near or at a\r\ndistance, in which cases it is not the same; and in this meaning, not in\r\nthat of Onesicritus, the sun is said to be near the Ethiopians.\r\n\r\n25. It is admitted by those who maintain the resemblance of India to\r\nEgypt and Ethiopia, that the plains which are not overflowed do not\r\nproduce anything for want of water.\r\n\r\nNearchus says, that the old question respecting the rise of the Nile is\r\nanswered by the case of the Indian rivers, namely, that it is the effect\r\nof summer rains; when Alexander saw crocodiles in the Hydaspes, and\r\nEgyptian beans in the Acesines, he thought that he had discovered the\r\nsources of the Nile, and was about to equip a fleet with the intention\r\nof sailing by this river to Egypt; but he found out shortly afterwards\r\nthat his design could not be accomplished,\r\n\r\n   “for in midway were vast rivers, fearful waters, and first\r\n   the ocean,”[355]\r\n\r\ninto which all the Indian rivers discharge themselves; then Ariana, the\r\nPersian and Arabian Gulfs, all Arabia and Troglodytica.\r\n\r\nThe above is what has been said on the subject of winds and rains, the\r\nrising of rivers, and the inundation of plains.\r\n\r\n26. We must describe these rivers in detail, with the particulars, which\r\nare useful for the purposes of geography, and which have been handed\r\ndown to us by historians.\r\n\r\nBesides this, rivers, being a kind of physical boundaries of the size\r\nand figures of countries, are of the greatest use in every part of the\r\npresent work. But the Nile and the rivers in India have a superiority\r\nabove the rest, because the country could not be inhabited without them.\r\nBy means of the rivers it is open to navigation and capable of\r\ncultivation, when otherwise it would not be accessible, nor could it be\r\noccupied by inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe shall speak of the rivers deserving notice, which flow into the\r\nIndus, and of the countries which they traverse; with regard to the rest\r\nwe know some particulars, but are ignorant of more. Alexander, who\r\ndiscovered the greatest portion of this country, first of all resolved\r\nit to be more expedient to pursue and destroy those who had\r\ntreacherously killed Darius, and were meditating the revolt of\r\nBactriana. He approached India therefore through Ariana, which he left\r\non the right hand, and crossed the Paropamisus to the northern parts,\r\nand to Bactriana.[356] Having conquered all the country subject to the\r\nPersians, and many other places besides, he then entertained the desire\r\nof possessing India, of which he had received many, although indistinct,\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nHe therefore returned, crossing over the same mountains by other and\r\nshorter roads, having India on the left hand; he then immediately turned\r\ntowards it, and towards its western boundaries and the rivers Cophes and\r\nChoaspes.[357] The latter river empties itself into the Cophes,[358]\r\nnear Plemyrium, after passing by another city Gorys, in its course\r\nthrough Bandobene and Gandaritis.[359]\r\n\r\nHe was informed that the mountainous and northern parts were the most\r\nhabitable and fertile, but that the southern part was either without\r\nwater, or liable to be overflowed by rivers at one time, or entirely\r\nburnt up at another, more fit to be the haunts of wild beasts than the\r\ndwellings of men. He resolved therefore to get possession of that part\r\nof India first which had been well spoken of, considering at the same\r\ntime that the rivers which it was necessary to pass, and which flowed\r\n[CAS. 697] transversely through the country which he intended to\r\nattack, would be crossed with more facility near their sources. He heard\r\nalso that many of the rivers united and formed one stream, and that this\r\nmore frequently occurred the farther they advanced into the country, so\r\nthat from want of boats it would be more difficult to traverse. Being\r\napprehensive of this obstruction, he crossed the Cophes, and conquered\r\nthe whole of the mountainous country situated towards the east.\r\n\r\n27. Next to the Cophes was the Indus, then the Hydaspes, the Acesines,\r\nthe Hyarotis, and last, the Hypanis. He was prevented from proceeding\r\nfarther, partly from regard to some oracles, and partly compelled by his\r\narmy, which was exhausted by toil and fatigue, but whose principal\r\ndistress arose from their constant exposure to rain. Hence we became\r\nacquainted with the eastern parts of India on this side the Hypanis, and\r\nwhatever parts besides which have been described by those who, after\r\nAlexander, advanced beyond the Hypanis to the Ganges and Palibothra.\r\n\r\nAfter the river Cophes, follows the Indus. The country lying between\r\nthese two rivers is occupied by Astaceni, Masiani, Nysæi, and\r\nHypasii.[360] Next is the territory of Assacanus, where is the city\r\nMasoga (Massaga?), the royal residence of the country. Near the Indus is\r\nanother city, Peucolaïtis.[361] At this place a bridge which was\r\nconstructed afforded a passage for the army.\r\n\r\n28. Between the Indus and the Hydaspes is Taxila, a large city, and\r\ngoverned by good laws. The neighbouring country is crowded with\r\ninhabitants and very fertile, and here unites with the plains. The\r\npeople and their king Taxiles received Alexander with kindness, and\r\nobtained in return more presents than they had offered to Alexander; so\r\nthat the Macedonians became jealous, and observed, that it seemed as if\r\nAlexander had found none on whom he could confer favours before he\r\npassed the Indus. Some writers say that this country is larger than\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nAbove this country among the mountains is the territory of\r\nAbisarus,[362] who, as the ambassadors that came from him reported,\r\nkept two serpents, one of 80, and the other, according to Onesicritus,\r\nof 140 cubits in length. This writer may as well be called the master\r\nfabulist as the master pilot of Alexander. For all those who accompanied\r\nAlexander preferred the marvellous to the true, but this writer seems to\r\nhave surpassed all in his description of prodigies. Some things,\r\nhowever, he relates which are probable and worthy of record, and will\r\nnot be passed over in silence even by one who does not believe their\r\ncorrectness.\r\n\r\nOther writers also mention the hunting of serpents in the Emodi\r\nmountains,[363] and the keeping and feeding of them in caves.\r\n\r\n29. Between the Hydaspes and Acesines is the country of Porus,[364] an\r\nextensive and fertile district, containing nearly three hundred cities.\r\nHere also is the forest in the neighbourhood of the Emodi mountains in\r\nwhich Alexander cut down a large quantity of fir, pine, cedar, and a\r\nvariety of other trees fit for ship-building, and brought the timber\r\ndown the Hydaspes. With this he constructed a fleet on the Hydaspes,\r\nnear the cities, which he built on each side of the river where he had\r\ncrossed it and conquered Porus. One of these cities he called\r\nBucephalia,[365] from the horse Bucephalus, which was [CAS. 699] killed\r\nin the battle with Porus. The name Bucephalus[366] was given to it from\r\nthe breadth of its forehead. He was an excellent war-horse, and\r\nAlexander constantly rode him in battle.\r\n\r\nThe other city he called Nicæa from the victory, ΝΙΚΗ\r\n(Nice), which he had obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the forest before mentioned it is said there is a vast number of\r\nmonkeys,[367] and as large as they are numerous. On one occasion the\r\nMacedonians, seeing a body of them standing in array opposite to them,\r\non some bare eminences, (for this animal is not less intelligent than\r\nthe elephant,) and presenting the appearance of an army, prepared to\r\nattack them as real enemies, but being informed by Taxiles, who was then\r\nwith the king, of the real fact, they desisted.\r\n\r\nThe chase of this animal is conducted in two different manners. It is an\r\nimitative creature, and takes refuge up among the trees. The hunters,\r\nwhen they perceive a monkey seated on a tree, place in sight a basin\r\ncontaining water, with which they wash their own eyes; then, instead of\r\nwater, they put a basin of bird-lime, go away, and lie in wait at a\r\ndistance. The animal leaps down, and besmears itself with the bird-lime,\r\nand when it winks, the eyelids are fastened together; the hunters then\r\ncome upon it, and take it.\r\n\r\nThe other method of capturing them is as follows: the hunters dress\r\nthemselves in bags like trowsers, and go away, leaving behind them\r\nothers which are downy, with the inside smeared over with bird-lime.\r\nThe monkeys put them on, and are easily taken.\r\n\r\n30. Some writers place Cathaia[368] and the country of Sopeithes, one of\r\nthe nomarchs, in the tract between the rivers (Hydaspes and Acesines);\r\nsome, on the other side of the Acesines and of the Hyarotis, on the\r\nconfines of the territory of the other Porus, the nephew of Porus who\r\nwas taken prisoner by Alexander, and call the country subject to him\r\nGrandaris.\r\n\r\nA very singular usage is related of the high estimation in which the\r\ninhabitants of Cathaia hold the quality of beauty, which they extend to\r\nhorses and dogs. According to Onesicritus, they elect the handsomest\r\nperson as king. The child (selected), two months after birth, undergoes\r\na public inspection, and is examined. They determine whether it has the\r\namount of beauty required by law, and whether it is worthy to be\r\npermitted to live. The presiding magistrate then pronounces whether it\r\nis to be allowed to live, or whether it is to be put to death.\r\n\r\nThey dye their heads with various and the most florid colours, for the\r\npurpose of improving their appearance. This custom prevails elsewhere\r\namong many of the Indians, who pay great attention to their hair and\r\ndress; and the country produces colours of great beauty. In other\r\nrespects the people are frugal, but are fond of ornament.\r\n\r\nA peculiar custom is related of the Cathæi. The bride and the husband\r\nare respectively the choice of each other, and the wives burn themselves\r\nwith their deceased husbands. The reason assigned for this practice is,\r\nthat the women sometimes fell in love with young men, and deserted or\r\npoisoned their husbands. This law was therefore established in order to\r\ncheck the practice of administering poison; but neither the existence\r\nnor the origin of the law are probable facts.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that in the territory of Sopeithes there is a mountain\r\ncomposed of fossile salt, sufficient for the whole of India. Valuable\r\nmines also both of gold and silver are situated, it is said, not far off\r\namong other mountains, according to the testimony of Gorgus, the miner\r\n(of Alexander). The Indians, unacquainted with mining and smelting, are\r\nignorant of their own wealth, and therefore traffic with greater\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\n31. The dogs in the territory of Sopeithes are said to possess\r\nremarkable courage: Alexander received from Sopeithes a present of one\r\nhundred and fifty of them. To prove them, two were set at a lion; when\r\nthese were mastered, two others were set on; when the battle became\r\nequal, Sopeithes ordered a man to seize one of the dogs by the leg, and\r\nto drag him away; or to cut off his leg, if he still held on. Alexander\r\nat first refused his consent to the dog’s leg being cut off, as he\r\nwished to save the dog. But on Sopeithes saying, “I will give you four\r\nin the place of it,” Alexander consented; and he saw the dog permit his\r\nleg to be cut off by a slow incision, rather than loose his hold.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 700] 32. The direction of the march, as far as the Hydaspes, was\r\nfor the most part towards the south. After that, to the Hypanis, it was\r\nmore towards the east. The whole of it, however, was much nearer to the\r\ncountry lying at the foot of the mountains than to the plains. Alexander\r\ntherefore, when he returned from the Hypanis to the Hydaspes and the\r\nstation of his vessels, prepared his fleet, and set sail on the\r\nHydaspes.\r\n\r\nAll the rivers which have been mentioned (the last of which is the\r\nHypanis) unite in one, the Indus. It is said that there are altogether\r\nfifteen[369] considerable rivers which flow into the Indus. After the\r\nIndus has been filled by all these rivers, so as to be enlarged in some\r\nplaces to the extent of a hundred stadia, according to writers who\r\nexaggerate, or, according to a more moderate estimate, to fifty stadia\r\nat the utmost, and at the least to seven, [and who speak of many nations\r\nand cities about this river,][370] it discharges itself by two mouths\r\ninto the southern sea, and forms the island called Patalene.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s intention was to relinquish the march towards the parts\r\nsituated to the east, first, because he was prevented from crossing the\r\nHypanis; next, because he learnt by experience the falsehood of the\r\nreports previously received, to the effect that the plains were burnt up\r\nwith fire, and more fit for the haunts of wild beasts than for the\r\nhabitation of man. He therefore set out in this direction, relinquishing\r\nthe other track; so that these parts became better known than the other.\r\n\r\n33. The territory lying between the Hypanis and the Hydaspes is said to\r\ncontain nine nations and five thousand cities, not less in size than Cos\r\nMeropis;[371] but the number seems to be exaggerated. We have already\r\nmentioned nearly all the nations deserving of notice, which inhabit the\r\ncountry situated between the Indus and the Hydaspes.\r\n\r\nBelow, and next in order, are the people called Sibæ, whom we formerly\r\nmentioned,[372] and the great nations, the Malli[373] and Sydracæ\r\n(Oxydracæ). It was among the Malli that Alexander was in danger of\r\nlosing his life, from a wound he received at the capture of a small\r\ncity. The Sydracæ, we have said, are fabled to be allied to Bacchus.\r\n\r\nNear Patalene is placed the country of Musicanus, that of Sabus,[374]\r\nwhose capital is Sindomana, that of Porticanus, and of other princes who\r\ninhabited the country on the banks of the Indus. They were all conquered\r\nby Alexander; last of all he made himself master of Patalene, which is\r\nformed by the two branches of the Indus. Aristobulus says that these two\r\nbranches are distant 1000 stadia from each other. Nearchus adds 800\r\nstadia more to this number. Onesicritus reckons each side of the\r\nincluded island, which is of a triangular shape, at 2000 stadia; and the\r\nbreadth of the river, where it is separated into two mouths, at about\r\n200 stadia.[375] He calls the island Delta, and says that it is as large\r\nas the Delta of Egypt; but this is a mistake. For the Egyptian Delta is\r\nsaid to have a base of 1300 stadia, and each of the sides to be less\r\nthan the base. In Patalene is Patala, a considerable city, from which\r\nthe island has its name.\r\n\r\n34. Onesicritus says, that the greatest part of the coast in this\r\nquarter abounds with swamps, particularly at the mouths of the river,\r\nwhich is owing to the mud, the tides, and the want of land breezes; for\r\nthese parts are chiefly under the influence of winds blowing from the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHe expatiates also in praise of the country of Musicanus, and relates of\r\nthe inhabitants what is common to other Indian tribes, that they are\r\nlong-lived, and that life is protracted even to the age of 130 years,\r\n(the Seres,[376] however, are said by some [CAS. 701] writers to be\r\nstill longer lived,) that they are temperate in their habits and\r\nhealthy; although the country produces everything in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe following are their peculiarities: to have a kind of Lacedæmonian\r\ncommon meal, where they eat in public. Their food consists of what is\r\ntaken in the chase. They make no use of gold nor silver, although they\r\nhave mines of these metals. Instead of slaves, they employed youths in\r\nthe flower of their age, as the Cretans employ the Aphamiotæ, and the\r\nLacedæmonians the Helots. They study no science with attention but that\r\nof medicine; for they consider the excessive pursuit of some arts, as\r\nthat of war, and the like, to be committing evil. There is no process at\r\nlaw but against murder and outrage, for it is not in a person’s own\r\npower to escape either one or the other; but as contracts are in the\r\npower of each individual, he must endure the wrong, if good faith is\r\nviolated by another; for a man should be cautious whom he trusts, and\r\nnot disturb the city with constant disputes in courts of justice.\r\n\r\nSuch are the accounts of the persons who accompanied Alexander in his\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n35. A letter of Craterus to his mother Aristopatra is circulated, which\r\ncontains many other singular circumstances, and differs from every other\r\nwriter, particularly in saying that Alexander advanced as far as the\r\nGanges. Craterus says, that he himself saw the river, and the\r\nwhales[377] which it produces, and [his account] of its magnitude,\r\nbreadth, and depth, far exceeds, rather than approximates, probability.\r\nFor that the Ganges is the largest of known rivers in the three\r\ncontinents, it is generally agreed; next to this is the Indus; and,\r\nthirdly, the Danube; and, fourthly, the Nile. But different authors\r\ndiffer in their account of it, some assigning 30, others 3 stadia, as\r\nthe least breadth. But Megasthenes says that its ordinary width is 100\r\nstadia,[378] and its least depth twenty orguiæ.[379]\r\n\r\n36. At the confluence of the Ganges and of another river (the\r\nErannoboas[380]) is situated (the city) Palibothra, in length 80, and in\r\nbreadth 15 stadia. It is in the shape of a parallelogram, surrounded by\r\na wooden wall pierced with openings through which arrows may be\r\ndischarged. In front is a ditch, which serves the purpose of defence and\r\nof a sewer for the city. The people in whose country the city is\r\nsituated are the most distinguished of all the tribes, and are called\r\nPrasii. The king, besides his family name, has the surname of\r\nPalibothrus, as the king to whom Megasthenes was sent on an embassy had\r\nthe name of Sandrocottus.[381]\r\n\r\nSuch also is the custom among the Parthians; for all have the name\r\nArsacæ,[382] although each has his peculiar name of Orodes, Phraates, or\r\nsome other appellation.\r\n\r\n37. All the country on the other side of the Hypanis is allowed to be\r\nvery fertile, but we have no accurate knowledge of it. Either through\r\nignorance or from its remote situation, everything relative to it is\r\nexaggerated or partakes of the wonderful. As, for example, the stories\r\nof myrmeces (or ants),[383] which dig up gold; of animals and men with\r\npeculiar shapes, and possessing extraordinary faculties; of the\r\nlongevity of the Seres, whose lives exceed the age of two hundred years.\r\nThey speak also of an aristocratical form of government, consisting of\r\nfive hundred counsellors, each of whom furnishes the state with an\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\nAccording to Megasthenes, the largest tigers are found among the Prasii,\r\nalmost twice the size of lions, and of such strength that a tame one led\r\nby four persons seized a mule by its hinder leg, overpowered it, and\r\ndragged it to him. The monkeys are larger than the largest dogs; they\r\nare of a white colour, except the face, which is black. The contrary is\r\nobserved in other places. Their tails are more than two cubits in\r\nlength. They are very tame, and not of a mischievous disposition. They\r\nneither attack people, nor steal.\r\n\r\nStones are found there of the colour of frankincense, and sweeter than\r\nfigs or honey.\r\n\r\nIn some places there are serpents of two cubits in length, with\r\nmembraneous wings like bats. They fly at night, and let fall drops of\r\nurine or sweat, which occasions the skin of persons [CAS. 703] who are\r\nnot on their guard to putrefy. There are also winged scorpions of great\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nEbony grows there. There are also dogs of great courage, which do not\r\nloose their hold till water is poured into their nostrils: some of them\r\ndestroy their sight, and the eyes of others even fall out, by the\r\neagerness of their bite. Both a lion and a bull were held fast by one of\r\nthese dogs. The bull was caught by the muzzle, and died before the dog\r\ncould be loosened.\r\n\r\n38. In the mountainous country is a river, the Silas, on the surface of\r\nwhich nothing will float. Democritus, who had travelled over a large\r\npart of Asia, disbelieves this, and Aristotle does not credit it,\r\nalthough atmospheres exist so rare that no bird can sustain its flight\r\nin them. Vapours also, which ascend (from some substances), attract and\r\nabsorb, as it were, whatever is flying over them; as amber attracts\r\nstraw, and the magnet iron, and perhaps there may be in water a similar\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAs these matters belong to physics and to the question of floating\r\nbodies, these must be referred to them. At present we must proceed to\r\nwhat follows, and to the subjects more nearly relating to geography.\r\n\r\n39. It is said that the Indians are divided into seven castes. The first\r\nin rank, but the smallest in number, are the philosophers. Persons who\r\nintend to offer sacrifice, or to perform any sacred rite, have the\r\nservices of these persons on their private account; but the kings employ\r\nthem in a public capacity at the time of the Great Assembly, as it is\r\ncalled, where at the beginning of the new year all the philosophers\r\nrepair to the king at the gate, and anything useful which they have\r\ncommitted to writing, or observed, tending to improve the productions of\r\nthe earth or animals, or of advantage to the government of the state, is\r\nthen publicly declared.\r\n\r\nWhoever has been detected in giving false information thrice is enjoined\r\nsilence by law during the rest of his life; but he who has made correct\r\nobservations is exempted from all contributions and tribute.\r\n\r\n40. The second caste is that of husbandmen, who constitute the majority\r\nof natives, and are a most mild and gentle people, as they are exempted\r\nfrom military service, and cultivate their land free from alarm; they\r\ndo not resort to cities, either to transact private business, or take\r\npart in public tumults. It therefore frequently happens that at the same\r\ntime, and in the same part of the country, one body of men are in battle\r\narray, and engaged in contests with the enemy, while others are\r\nploughing or digging in security, having these soldiers to protect them.\r\nThe whole of the territory belongs to the king. They cultivate it on the\r\nterms of receiving as wages a fourth part of the produce.\r\n\r\n41. The third caste consists of shepherds and hunters, who alone are\r\npermitted to hunt, to breed cattle, to sell and to let out for hire\r\nbeasts of burden. In return for freeing the country from wild beasts and\r\nbirds, which infest sown fields, they receive an allowance of corn from\r\nthe king. They lead a wandering life, and dwell in tents. No private\r\nperson is allowed to keep a horse or an elephant. The possession of\r\neither one or the other is a royal privilege, and persons are appointed\r\nto take care of them.\r\n\r\n42. The manner of hunting the elephant is as follows: Round a bare spot\r\na ditch is dug, of about four or five stadia in extent, and at the place\r\nof entrance a very narrow bridge is constructed. Into the enclosure\r\nthree or four of the tamest female elephants are driven. The men\r\nthemselves lie in wait under cover of concealed huts. The wild elephants\r\ndo not approach the females by day, but at night they enter the\r\nenclosure one by one; when they have passed the entrance, the men\r\nsecretly close it. They then introduce the strongest of the tame\r\ncombatants, the drivers of which engage with the wild animals, and also\r\nwear them out by famine; when the latter are exhausted by fatigue, the\r\nboldest of the drivers gets down unobserved, and creeps under the belly\r\nof his own elephant. From this position he creeps beneath the belly of\r\nthe wild elephant, and ties his legs together; when this is done, a\r\nsignal is given to the tame elephants to beat those which are tied by\r\nthe legs, till they fall to the ground. After they have fallen down,\r\nthey fasten the wild and tame elephants together by the neck with thongs\r\nof raw cow-hide, and, in order that they may not be able to shake off\r\nthose who are attempting to mount them, cuts are made round the neck,\r\nand thongs of leather are put into these incisions, so that they submit\r\nto their bonds through pain, and so remain quiet. Among the elephants\r\n[CAS. 705] which are taken, those are rejected which are too old or too\r\nyoung for service; the remainder are led away to the stables. They tie\r\ntheir feet one to another, and their necks to a pillar firmly fastened\r\nin the ground, and tame them by hunger. They recruit their strength\r\nafterwards with green cane and grass. They then teach them to obey; some\r\nby words; others they pacify by tunes, accompanied with the beating of a\r\ndrum. Few are difficult to be tamed; for they are naturally of a mild\r\nand gentle disposition, so as to approximate to the character of a\r\nrational animal. Some have taken up their drivers, who have fallen on\r\nthe ground lifeless, and carried them safe out of battle. Others have\r\nfought, and protected their drivers, who have crept between their\r\nfore-legs. If they have killed any of their feeders or masters in anger,\r\nthey feel their loss so much that they refuse their food through grief,\r\nand sometimes die of hunger.\r\n\r\n43. They copulate like horses, and produce young chiefly in the spring.\r\nIt is the season for the male, when he is in heat and is ferocious. At\r\nthis period he discharges some fatty matter through an opening in the\r\ntemples. It is the season also for the females, when this same passage\r\nis open. Eighteen months is the longest, and sixteen the shortest period\r\nthat they go with young. The dam suckles her young six years. Many of\r\nthem live as long as men who attain to the greatest longevity, some even\r\nto the protracted age of two hundred years.\r\n\r\nThey are subject to many diseases, which are difficult to be cured. A\r\nremedy for diseases of the eye is to bathe them with cow’s milk. For\r\ncomplaints in general, they drink dark wine. In cases of wounds, they\r\ndrink butter; for it draws out iron instruments. Their sores are\r\nfomented with swine’s flesh.\r\n\r\nOnesicritus says, that they live three hundred years, and rarely five\r\nhundred; and that they go with young ten years. He and other writers\r\nsay, that they are larger and stronger than the African elephants. They\r\nwill pull down with their trunks battlements, and uproot trees, standing\r\nerect upon their hind feet.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nearchus, traps are laid in the hunting grounds, at certain\r\nplaces where roads meet; the wild elephants are forced into the toils by\r\nthe tame elephants, which are stronger, and guided by a driver. They\r\nbecome so tame and docile, that they learn even to throw a stone at a\r\nmark, to use military weapons, and to be excellent swimmers. A chariot\r\ndrawn by elephants is esteemed a most important possession, and they are\r\ndriven without bridles.[384]\r\n\r\nA woman is greatly honoured who receives from her lover a present of an\r\nelephant, but this does not agree with what he said before, that a horse\r\nand an elephant are the property of kings alone.\r\n\r\n44. This writer says that he saw skins of the myrmeces (or ants), which\r\ndig up gold, as large as the skins of leopards. Megasthenes, however,\r\nspeaking of the myrmeces, says, among the Derdæ a populous nation of the\r\nIndians, living towards the east, and among the mountains, there was a\r\nmountain plain of about 3000 stadia in circumference; that below this\r\nplain were mines containing gold, which the myrmeces, in size not less\r\nthan foxes, dig up. They are excessively fleet, and subsist on what they\r\ncatch. In winter they dig holes, and pile up the earth in heaps, like\r\nmoles, at the mouths of the openings.\r\n\r\nThe gold-dust which they obtain requires little preparation by fire. The\r\nneighbouring people go after it by stealth, with beasts of burden; for\r\nif it is done openly, the myrmeces fight furiously, pursuing those that\r\nrun away, and if they seize them, kill them and the beasts. In order to\r\nprevent discovery, they place in various parts pieces of the flesh of\r\nwild beasts, and when the myrmeces are dispersed in various directions,\r\nthey take away the gold-dust, and, not being acquainted with the mode of\r\nsmelting it, dispose of it in its rude state at any price to merchants.\r\n\r\n45. Having mentioned what Megasthenes and other writers relate of the\r\nhunters and the beasts of prey, we must add the following particulars.\r\n\r\nNearchus is surprised at the multitude and the noxious nature of the\r\ntribe of reptiles. They retreat from the plains to the settlements,\r\nwhich are not covered with water at the period of inundations, and fill\r\nthe houses. For this reason the inhabitants raise their beds at some\r\nheight from the [CAS. 706] ground, and are sometimes compelled to\r\nabandon their dwellings, when they are infested by great multitudes of\r\nthese animals; and, if a great proportion of these multitudes were not\r\ndestroyed by the waters, the country would be a desert. Both the\r\nminuteness of some animals and the excessive magnitude of others are\r\ncauses of danger; the former, because it is difficult to guard against\r\ntheir attacks; the latter, on account of their strength, for snakes are\r\nto be seen of sixteen cubits in length. Charmers go about the country,\r\nand are supposed to cure wounds made by serpents. This seems to comprise\r\nnearly their whole art of medicine, for disease is not frequent among\r\nthem, which is owing to their frugal manner of life, and to the absence\r\nof wine; whenever diseases do occur, they are treated by the Sophistæ\r\n(or wise men).\r\n\r\nAristobulus says, that he saw no animals of these pretended magnitudes,\r\nexcept a snake, which was nine cubits and a span in length. And I myself\r\nsaw one in Egypt, nearly of the same size, which was brought from India.\r\nHe says also, that he saw many serpents of a much inferior size, and\r\nasps and large scorpions. None of these, however, are so noxious as the\r\nslender small serpents, a span long, which are found concealed in tents,\r\nin vessels, and in hedges. Persons wounded by them bleed from every\r\npore, suffering great pain, and die, unless they have immediate\r\nassistance; but this assistance is easily obtained, by means of the\r\nvirtues of the Indian roots and drugs.\r\n\r\nFew crocodiles, he says, are found in the Indus, and these are harmless,\r\nbut most of the other animals, except the hippopotamus, are the same as\r\nthose found in the Nile; but Onesicritus says that this animal also is\r\nfound there.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aristobulus, none of the sea fish ascend the Nile from the\r\nsea, except the shad,[385] the grey mullet,[386] and dolphin, on account\r\nof the crocodiles; but great numbers ascend the Indus. Small\r\ncraw-fish[387] go up as far as the mountains,[388] and the larger as far\r\nas the confluence of the Indus and the Acesines.\r\n\r\nSo much then on the subject of the wild animals of India. We shall\r\nreturn to Megasthenes, and resume our account where we digressed.\r\n\r\n46. After the hunters and the shepherds, follows the fourth caste, which\r\nconsists, he says, of those who work at trades, retail wares, and who\r\nare employed in bodily labour. Some of these pay taxes, and perform\r\ncertain stated services. But the armour-makers and ship-builders receive\r\nwages and provisions from the king, for whom only they work. The\r\ngeneral-in-chief furnishes the soldiers with arms, and the admiral lets\r\nout ships for hire to those who undertake voyages and traffic as\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n47. The fifth caste consists of fighting men, who pass the time not\r\nemployed in the field in idleness and drinking, and are maintained at\r\nthe charge of the king. They are ready whenever they are wanted to march\r\non an expedition, for they bring nothing of their own with them, except\r\ntheir bodies.\r\n\r\n48. The sixth caste is that of the Ephori, or inspectors. They are\r\nintrusted with the superintendence of all that is going on, and it is\r\ntheir duty to report privately to the king. The city inspectors employ\r\nas their coadjutors the city courtesans; and the inspectors of the camp,\r\nthe women who follow it. The best and the most faithful persons are\r\nappointed to the office of inspector.\r\n\r\n49. The seventh caste consists of counsellors and assessors of the king.\r\nTo these persons belong the offices of state, tribunals of justice, and\r\nthe whole administration of affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is not permitted to contract marriage with a person of another caste,\r\nnor to change from one profession or trade to another, nor for the same\r\nperson to undertake several, except he is of the caste of philosophers,\r\nwhen permission is given, on account of his superior qualifications.\r\n\r\n50. Of the magistrates, some have the charge of the market, others of\r\nthe city, others of the soldiery. Some have the care of the rivers,\r\nmeasure the land, as in Egypt, and inspect the closed reservoirs, from\r\nwhich water is distributed by canals, so that all may have an equal use\r\nof it. These persons have charge also of the hunters, and have the power\r\nof rewarding or punishing those who merit either. They collect the\r\ntaxes, and superintend the occupations connected with land, as\r\nwood-cutters, carpenters, workers in brass, and miners. They [CAS. 708]\r\nsuperintend the public roads, and place a pillar at every ten stadia, to\r\nindicate the by-ways and distances.\r\n\r\n51. Those who have charge of the city are divided into six bodies of\r\nfive each. The first has the inspection of everything relating to the\r\nmechanical arts; the second entertain strangers, assign lodgings,\r\nobserve their mode of life, by means of attendants whom they attach to\r\nthem, escort them out of the country on their departure; if they die,\r\ntake charge of their property, have the care of them when sick, and when\r\nthey die, bury them.\r\n\r\nThe third class consists of those who inquire at what time and in what\r\nmanner births and deaths take place, which is done with a view to tax\r\n(on these occasions), and in order that the deaths and births of persons\r\nboth of good and bad character should not be concealed.\r\n\r\nThe fourth division consists of those who are occupied in sales and\r\nexchanges; they have the charge of measures, and of the sale of the\r\nproducts in season, by a signal. The same person is not allowed to\r\nexchange various kinds of articles, except he pays a double tax.\r\n\r\nThe fifth division presides over works of artisans, and disposes of\r\narticles by public notice. The new are sold apart from the old, and\r\nthere is a fine imposed for mixing them together. The sixth and last\r\ncomprises those who collect the tenth of the price of the articles sold.\r\nDeath is the punishment for committing a fraud with regard to the tax.\r\n\r\nThese are the peculiar duties performed by each class, but in their\r\ncollective capacity they have the charge both of their own peculiar\r\nprovince and of civil affairs, the repairs of public works, prices[389]\r\nof articles, of markets, harbours, and temples.\r\n\r\n52. Next to the magistrates of the city is a third body of governors,\r\nwho have the care of military affairs. This class also consists of six\r\ndivisions, each composed of five persons. One division is associated\r\nwith the chief naval superintendent, another with the person who has the\r\ncharge of the bullock-teams, by which military engines are transported,\r\nof provisions both for the men and beasts, and other requisites for the\r\narmy. They furnish attendants, who beat a drum, and carry gongs;[390]\r\nand besides these, grooms, mechanists, and their assistants. They\r\ndespatch by the sound of the gong the foragers for grass, and insure\r\nexpedition and security by rewards and punishments. The third division\r\nhas the care of the infantry; the fourth, of the horses; the fifth, of\r\nthe chariots; the sixth, of the elephants. There are royal stables for\r\nthe horses and elephants. There is also a royal magazine of arms; for\r\nthe soldier returns his arms to the armoury, and the horse and elephant\r\nto the stables. They use the elephants without bridles. The chariots are\r\ndrawn on the march by oxen. The horses are led by a halter, in order\r\nthat their legs may not be chafed and inflamed, nor their spirit damped,\r\nby drawing chariots. Besides the charioteer, there are two persons who\r\nfight by his side in the chariot. With the elephant are four persons,\r\nthe driver and three bowmen, who discharge arrows from his back.\r\n\r\n53. All the Indians are frugal in their mode of life, and especially in\r\ncamp. They do not tolerate useless and undisciplined multitudes, and\r\nconsequently observe good order. Theft is very rare among them.\r\nMegasthenes, who was in the camp of Sandrocottus, which consisted of\r\n400,000 men, did not witness on any day thefts reported, which exceeded\r\nthe sum of two hundred drachmæ, and this among a people who have no\r\nwritten laws, who are ignorant even of writing, and regulate everything\r\nby memory. They are, however, happy on account of their simple manners\r\nand frugal way of life. They never drink wine, but at sacrifices. Their\r\nbeverage is made from rice instead of barley, and their food consists\r\nfor the most part of rice pottage. The simplicity of their laws and\r\ncontracts appears from their not having many law-suits. They have no\r\nsuits respecting pledges and deposits, nor do they require witnesses or\r\nseals, but make their deposits, and confide in one another. Their houses\r\nand property are unguarded. These things denote temperance and sobriety;\r\nothers no one would approve, as their eating always alone, and their not\r\nhaving all of them one common hour for their meals, but each taking it\r\nas he likes. The contrary custom is more agreeable to the habits of\r\nsocial and civil life.\r\n\r\n54. As an exercise of the body they prefer friction in various ways, but\r\nparticularly by making use of smooth sticks of ebony, which they pass\r\nover the surface of the body.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 709] Their sepulchres are plain, and the tumuli of earth low.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to their parsimony in other things, they indulge in\r\nornament. They wear dresses worked with gold and precious stones, and\r\nflowered (variegated) robes, and are attended by persons following them\r\nwith umbrellas; for as they highly esteem beauty, everything is attended\r\nto, which can improve their looks.\r\n\r\nThey respect alike truth and virtue; therefore they do not assign any\r\nprivilege to the old, unless they possess superior wisdom.\r\n\r\nThey marry many wives, who are purchased from their parents, and give in\r\nexchange for them a yoke of oxen. Some marry wives to possess obedient\r\nattendants, others with a view to pleasure and numerous offspring, and\r\nthe wives prostitute themselves, unless chastity is enforced by\r\ncompulsion.\r\n\r\nNo one wears a garland when sacrificing, or burning incense, or pouring\r\nout a libation. They do not stab, but strangle the victim, that nothing\r\nmutilated, but that which is entire, may be offered to the Deity.\r\n\r\nA person convicted of bearing false testimony suffers a mutilation of\r\nhis extremities. He who has maimed another not only undergoes in return\r\nthe loss of the same limb, but his hand also is cut off. If he has\r\ncaused a workman to lose his hand or his eye, he is put to death.\r\n\r\nMegasthenes says, that none of the Indians employ slaves. But, according\r\nto Onesicritus, this is peculiar to the people in the territory of\r\nMusicanus. He speaks of this as an excellent rule, and mentions many\r\nothers to be found in that country, as the effects of a government by\r\ngood laws.\r\n\r\n55. The care of the king’s person is committed to women, who are also\r\npurchased of their parents. The body-guard, and the rest of the\r\nmilitary, are stationed without the gates. A woman, who puts to death a\r\nking when drunk, is rewarded by becoming the wife of his successor. The\r\nsons succeed the father. The king may not sleep during the day-time, and\r\nat night he is obliged from time to time to change his bed, from dread\r\nof treachery.\r\n\r\nThe king leaves his palace in time of war; he leaves it also when he\r\ngoes to sit in his court as a judge. He remains there all day thus\r\noccupied, not suffering himself to be interrupted even though the time\r\narrives for attending to his person. This attention to his person\r\nconsists of friction with pieces of wood, and he continues to listen to\r\nthe cause, while the friction is performed by four attendants who\r\nsurround him.\r\n\r\nAnother occasion of leaving his palace is to offer sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe third is a sort of Bacchanalian departure to the chace. Crowds of\r\nwomen surround him, and on the outside (of these) are spear-men. The\r\nroad is set off with ropes; a man, or even a woman, who passes within\r\nthe ropes is put to death.\r\n\r\nThe king is preceded by drums and gongs. He hunts in the enclosures, and\r\ndischarges his arrows from a high seat. Near him stand two or three\r\narmed women. When hunting in the open ground, he shoots his arrows from\r\nan elephant; of the women some are in chariots, some on horses, and\r\nothers on elephants; they are provided with all kinds of weapons, as if\r\nthey were going on a military expedition.\r\n\r\n56. These customs when compared with ours are very strange, but the\r\nfollowing are still more extraordinary. According to Megasthenes, the\r\nnations who inhabit the Caucasus have commerce with women in public; and\r\neat the bodies of their relatives; the monkeys climb precipices, and\r\nroll down large stones upon their pursuers; most of the animals which\r\nare tame in our country are wild in theirs; the horses have a single\r\nhorn, with heads like those of deer; reeds which grow to the height of\r\nthirty orguiæ,[391] others which grow on the ground, fifty orguiæ in\r\nlength, and in thickness some are three and others six cubits in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n57. He then deviates into fables, and says that there are men of five,\r\nand even three spans in height, some of whom are without nostrils, with\r\nonly two breathing orifices above the mouth. Those of three spans in\r\nheight wage war with the cranes (described by Homer) and with the\r\npartridges, which are as large as geese; these people collect and\r\ndestroy the eggs of the cranes which lay their eggs there; and nowhere\r\nelse are the eggs or the young cranes to be found; frequently a crane\r\nescapes from this country with a brazen point of a weapon in its body,\r\nwounded by these people.\r\n\r\nSimilar to this is the account of the Enotocoitæ,[392] of the wild men,\r\nand of other monsters. The wild men could not be brought to\r\nSandrocottus, for they died by abstaining from [CAS. 711] food. Their\r\nheels are in front, the instep and toes are turned backwards. Some have\r\nbeen taken, which had no mouths, and were tame. They live near the\r\nsources of the Ganges, and are supported by the smell of dressed meat\r\nand the fragrance of fruits and flowers, having instead of mouths\r\norifices through which they breathe. They are distressed by\r\nstrong-smelling substances, and therefore their lives are sustained with\r\ndifficulty, particularly in a camp.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other singular animals, the philosophers informed\r\nhim of a people called Ocypodæ, so swift of foot that they leave horses\r\nbehind them; of Enotocoitæ, or persons having ears hanging down to their\r\nfeet, so that they lie and sleep upon them, and so strong as to be able\r\nto pluck up trees and to break the sinew string of a bow; of others\r\n(Monommati) who have only one eye, and the ears of a dog, the eye placed\r\nin the middle of the forehead, the hair standing erect, and the breasts\r\nshaggy; of others (Amycteres) without nostrils, devouring everything,\r\neaters of raw meat, short-lived, and dying before they arrive at old\r\nage; the upper part of their mouths projects far beyond the lower lip.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Hyperboreans, who live to the age of a thousand\r\nyears, his description is the same as that of Simonides, Pindar, and\r\nother mythological writers.\r\n\r\nThe story told by Timagenes of a shower of drops of brass, which were\r\nraked together, is a fable. The account of Megasthenes is more probable,\r\nnamely, that the rivers bring down gold-dust, a part of which is paid as\r\na tax to the king; and this is the case in Iberia (of Armenia).\r\n\r\n58. Speaking of the philosophers, he says, that those who inhabit the\r\nmountains are worshippers of Bacchus, and show as a proof (of the god\r\nhaving come among them) the wild vine, which grows in their country\r\nonly; the ivy, the laurel, the myrtle, the box-tree, and other\r\nevergreens, none of which are found beyond the Euphrates, except a few\r\nin parks, which are only preserved with great care. To wear robes and\r\nturbans, to use perfumes, and to be dressed in dyed and flowered\r\ngarments, for their kings to be preceded when they leave their palaces,\r\nand appear abroad, by gongs and drums, are Bacchanalian customs. But the\r\nphilosophers who live in the plains worship Hercules.\r\n\r\nThese are fabulous stories, contradicted by many writers, particularly\r\nwhat is said of the vine and wine, for a great part of Armenia, the\r\nwhole of Mesopotamia and Media, as far as Persia and Carmania, is beyond\r\nthe Euphrates, the greater part of which countries is said to have\r\nexcellent vines, and to produce good wine.\r\n\r\n59. Megasthenes divides the philosophers again into two kinds, the\r\nBrachmanes[393] and the Garmanes.[394] The Brachmanes are held in\r\ngreater repute, for they agree more exactly in their opinions. Even from\r\nthe time of their conception in the womb they are under the care and\r\nguardianship of learned men, who go to the mother, and seem to perform\r\nsome incantation for the happiness and welfare of the mother and the\r\nunborn child, but in reality they suggest prudent advice, and the\r\nmothers who listen to them most willingly are thought to be the most\r\nfortunate in their offspring. After the birth of the children, there is\r\na succession of persons who have the care of them, and as they advance\r\nin years, masters more able and accomplished succeed.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers live in a grove in front of the city within a\r\nmoderate-sized enclosure. Their diet is frugal, and they lie upon straw\r\npallets and on skins. They abstain from animal food, and from sexual\r\nintercourse with women; their time is occupied in grave discourse, and\r\nthey communicate with those who are inclined to listen to them; but the\r\nhearer is not permitted to speak or cough, or even to spit on the\r\nground; otherwise, he is expelled that very day from their society, on\r\nthe ground of having no control over himself. After living thirty-seven\r\nyears in this manner, each individual retires to his own possessions,\r\nand lives with less restraint, wearing robes of fine linen, and rings of\r\ngold, but without profuseness, upon the hands and in the ears. They eat\r\nthe flesh of animals, of those particularly which do not assist man in\r\nhis labour, and abstain from hot and seasoned food. They have as many\r\nwives as they please with a view to numerous offspring, for from many\r\nwives greater advantages are derived.\r\n\r\nAs they have no slaves, they require more the services, which are at\r\nhand, of their children.\r\n\r\nThe Brachmanes do not communicate their philosophy to their wives, for\r\nfear they should divulge to the profane, if [CAS. 712] they became\r\ndepraved, anything which ought to be concealed; or lest they should\r\nabandon their husbands in case they became good (philosophers)\r\nthemselves. For no one who despises alike pleasure and pain, life and\r\ndeath, is willing to be subject to the authority of another; and such is\r\nthe character of a virtuous man and a virtuous woman.\r\n\r\nThey discourse much on death, for it is their opinion that the present\r\nlife is the state of one conceived in the womb, and that death to\r\nphilosophers is birth to a real and a happy life. They therefore\r\ndiscipline themselves much to prepare for death, and maintain that\r\nnothing which happens to man is bad or good, for otherwise the same\r\nthings would not be the occasion of sorrow to some and of joy to others,\r\nopinions being merely dreams, nor that the same persons could be\r\naffected with sorrow and joy by the same things, on different occasions.\r\n\r\nWith regard to opinions on physical phenomena, they display, says\r\nMegasthenes, great simplicity, their actions being better than their\r\nreasoning, for their belief is chiefly founded on fables. On many\r\nsubjects their sentiments are the same as those of the Greeks. According\r\nto the Brachmanes, the world was created, and is liable to corruption;\r\nit is of a spheroïdal figure; the god who made and governs it pervades\r\nthe whole of it; the principles of all things are different, but the\r\nprinciple of the world’s formation was water; in addition to the four\r\nelements there is a fifth nature, of which the heavens and the stars are\r\ncomposed; the earth is situated in the centre of the universe. Many\r\nother peculiar things they say of the principle of generation and of the\r\nsoul. They invent fables also, after the manner of Plato, on the\r\nimmortality of the soul, and on the punishments in Hades, and other\r\nthings of this kind. This is the account which Megasthenes gives of the\r\nBrachmanes.\r\n\r\n60. Of the Garmanes, the most honourable, he says, are the Hylobii, who\r\nlive in the forests, and subsist on leaves and wild fruits: they are\r\nclothed with garments made of the bark of trees,[395] and abstain from\r\ncommerce with women and from wine. The kings hold communication with\r\nthem by messengers, concerning the causes of things, and through them\r\nworship and supplicate the Divinity.\r\n\r\nSecond in honour to the Hylobii, are the physicians, for they apply\r\nphilosophy to the study of the nature of man. They are of frugal habits,\r\nbut do not live in the fields, and subsist upon rice and meal, which\r\nevery one gives when asked, and receive them hospitably. They are able\r\nto cause persons to have a numerous offspring, and to have either male\r\nor female children, by means of charms. They cure diseases by diet,\r\nrather than by medicinal remedies. Among the latter, the most in repute\r\nare unguents and cataplasms. All others they suppose partake greatly of\r\na noxious nature.\r\n\r\nBoth this and the other class of persons practise fortitude, as well in\r\nsupporting active toil as in enduring suffering, so that they will\r\ncontinue a whole day in the same posture, without motion.\r\n\r\nThere are enchanters and diviners, versed in the rites and customs\r\nrelative to the dead, who go about villages and towns begging. There are\r\nothers who are more civilized and better informed than these, who\r\ninculcate the vulgar opinions concerning Hades, which, according to\r\ntheir ideas, tend to piety and sanctity. Women study philosophy with\r\nsome of them, but abstain from sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n61. Aristobulus says, that he saw at Taxila two sophists (wise men),\r\nboth Brachmanes, the elder had his head shaved, but the younger wore his\r\nhair; both were attended by disciples. When not otherwise engaged, they\r\nspent their time in the market-place. They are honoured as public\r\ncounsellors, and have the liberty of taking away, without payment,\r\nwhatever article they like which is exposed for sale; when any one\r\naccosts them, he pours over them oil of jessamine, in such profusion\r\nthat it runs down from their eyes. Of honey and sesamum, which is\r\nexposed for sale in large quantity, they take enough to make cakes, and\r\nare fed without expense.\r\n\r\nThey came up to Alexander’s table and took their meal standing, and they\r\ngave an example of their fortitude by retiring to a neighbouring spot,\r\nwhere the elder, falling on the ground supine, endured the sun and the\r\nrain, which had now set in, it being the commencement of spring. The\r\nother stood on one leg, with a piece of wood three cubits in length\r\nraised in both hands; when one leg was fatigued he changed the support\r\nto the other, and thus continued the whole day. The younger appeared to\r\npossess much more self-command; for, [CAS. 714] after following the\r\nking a short distance, he soon returned to his home. The king sent after\r\nhim, but he bade the king to come to him, if he wanted anything of him.\r\nThe other accompanied the king to the last: during his stay he changed\r\nhis dress, and altered his mode of life, and when reproached for his\r\nconduct, answered, that he had completed the forty years of discipline\r\nwhich he had promised to observe: Alexander made presents to his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n62. Aristobulus relates also some strange and unusual customs of the\r\npeople of Taxila. Those, who through poverty are unable to marry their\r\ndaughters, expose them for sale in the market-place, in the flower of\r\ntheir age, to the sound of shell trumpets and drums, with which the\r\nwar-note is given. A crowd is thus assembled. First her back, as far as\r\nthe shoulders, is uncovered, then the parts in front, for the\r\nexamination of any man who comes for this purpose. If she pleases him,\r\nhe marries her on such conditions as may be determined upon.\r\n\r\nThe dead are thrown out to be devoured by vultures. To have many wives\r\nis a custom common to these and to other nations. He says, that he had\r\nheard, from some persons, of wives burning themselves voluntarily with\r\ntheir deceased husbands; and that those women who refused to submit to\r\nthis custom were disgraced. The same things have been told by other\r\nwriters.[396]\r\n\r\n63. Onesicritus says, that he himself was sent to converse with these\r\nwise men. For Alexander heard that they went about naked, practised\r\nconstancy and fortitude, and were held in the highest honour; that, when\r\ninvited, they did not go to other persons, but commanded others to come\r\nto them, if they wished to participate in their exercises or their\r\nconversation. Such being their character, Alexander did not consider it\r\nto be consistent with propriety to go to them, nor to compel them to do\r\nanything contrary to their inclination or against the custom of their\r\ncountry; he therefore despatched Onesicritus to them.\r\n\r\nOnesicritus found, at the distance of 20 stadia from the city, fifteen\r\nmen standing in different postures, sitting or lying down naked, who\r\ncontinued in these positions until the evening, and then returned to the\r\ncity. The most difficult thing to endure was the heat of the sun, which\r\nwas so powerful, that no one else could endure without pain to walk on\r\nthe ground at mid-day with bare feet.\r\n\r\n64. He conversed with Calanus, one of these sophists, who accompanied\r\nthe king to Persia, and died after the custom of his country, being\r\nplaced on a pile of [burning] wood. When Onesicritus came, he was lying\r\nupon stones. Onesicritus approached, accosted him, and told him that he\r\nhad been sent by the king, who had heard the fame of his wisdom, and\r\nthat he was to give an account of his interview, if there were no\r\nobjection, he was ready to listen to his discourse. When Calanus saw his\r\nmantle, head-covering, and shoes, he laughed, and said, “Formerly, there\r\nwas abundance everywhere of corn and barley, as there is now of dust;\r\nfountains then flowed with water, milk, honey, wine, and oil, but\r\nmankind by repletion and luxury became proud and insolent. Jupiter,\r\nindignant at this state of things, destroyed all, and appointed for man\r\na life of toil. On the reäppearance of temperance and other virtues,\r\nthere was again an abundance of good things. But at present the\r\ncondition of mankind approaches satiety and insolence, and there is\r\ndanger lest the things which now exist should disappear.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, he proposed to Onesicritus, if he wished to hear\r\nhis discourse, to strip off his clothes, to lie down naked by him on the\r\nsame stones, and in that manner to listen to him; while he was\r\nhesitating what to do, Mandanis,[397] who was the oldest and wisest of\r\nthe sophists, reproached Calanus for his insolence, although he censured\r\nsuch insolence himself. Mandanis called Onesicritus to him, and said, I\r\ncommend the king, because, although he governs so large an empire, he is\r\nyet desirous of acquiring wisdom, for he is the only philosopher in arms\r\nthat I ever saw; it would be of the greatest advantage, if those were\r\nphilosophers who have the power of persuading the willing and of\r\ncompelling the unwilling to learn temperance; but I am entitled to\r\nindulgence, if, when conversing by means of three interpreters, who,\r\nexcept the language, know no more than the vulgar, I am not [CAS. 716]\r\nable to demonstrate the utility of philosophy. To attempt it is to\r\nexpect water to flow pure through mud.\r\n\r\n65. “The tendency of his discourse,” he said, “was this, that the best\r\nphilosophy was that which liberated the mind from pleasure and grief;\r\nthat grief differed from labour, in that the former was inimical, the\r\nlatter friendly to men; for that men exercised their bodies with labour\r\nin order to strengthen the mental powers, by which means they would be\r\nable to put an end to dissensions, and give good counsel to all, to the\r\npublic and to individuals; that he certainly should at present advise\r\nTaxiles to receive Alexander as a friend; for if he entertained a person\r\nbetter than himself, he might be improved; but if a worse person, he\r\nmight dispose him to good.”\r\n\r\nAfter this Mandanis inquired, whether such doctrines were taught among\r\nthe Greeks. Onesicritus answered, that Pythagoras taught a similar\r\ndoctrine, and enjoined his disciples to abstain from whatever has life;\r\nthat Socrates and Diogenes, whose discourses he had heard, held the same\r\nopinions. Mandanis replied, “that in other respects he thought them\r\nwise, but that in one thing they were mistaken, namely, in preferring\r\ncustom to nature, for otherwise they would not be ashamed of going\r\nnaked, like himself, and of subsisting on frugal fare; for the best\r\nhouse was that which required least repairs.” He says also that they\r\nemploy themselves much on natural subjects, as prognostics, rain,\r\ndrought, and diseases. When they repair to the city, they disperse\r\nthemselves in the market-places; if they meet any one carrying figs or\r\nbunches of grapes, they take what is offered gratuitously; if it is oil,\r\nit is poured over them, and they are anointed with it. Every wealthy\r\nhouse, even to the women’s apartment, is open to them; when they enter\r\nit, they engage in conversation, and partake of the repast. Disease of\r\nthe body they regard as most disgraceful, and he who apprehends it,\r\nafter preparing a pyre, destroys himself by fire; he (previously)\r\nanoints himself, and sitting down upon it orders it to be lighted,\r\nremaining motionless while he is burning.\r\n\r\n66. Nearchus gives the following account of the Sophists. The Brachmanes\r\nengage in public affairs, and attend the kings as counsellors; the rest\r\nare occupied in the study of nature. Calanus belonged to the latter\r\nclass. Women study philosophy with them, and all lead an austere life.\r\n\r\nOf the customs of the other Indians, he says, that their laws, whether\r\nrelating to the community or to individuals, are not committed to\r\nwriting, and differ altogether from those of other people. For example,\r\nit is the practice among some tribes, to propose virgins as prizes to\r\nthe conquerors in a trial of skill in boxing; wherefore they marry\r\nwithout portions; among other tribes the ground is cultivated by\r\nfamilies and in common; when the produce is collected, each takes a load\r\nsufficient for his subsistence during the year; the remainder is burnt,\r\nin order to have a reason for renewing their labour, and not remaining\r\ninactive. Their weapons consist of a bow and arrows, which are three\r\ncubits in length, or a javelin, and a shield, and a sword three cubits\r\nlong. Instead of bridles, they use muzzles,[398] which differ little\r\nfrom a halter, and the lips are perforated with spikes.\r\n\r\n67. Nearchus, producing proofs of their skill in works of art, says,\r\nthat when they saw sponges in use among the Macedonians, they imitated\r\nthem by sewing hairs, thin threads, and strings in wool; after the wool\r\nwas felted, they drew out the hairs, threads, and strings, and dyed it\r\nwith colours. There quickly appeared also manufactures of brushes for\r\nthe body, and of vessels for oil (lecythi). They write, he says, letters\r\nupon cloth, smoothed by being well beaten, although other authors affirm\r\nthat they have no knowledge of writing. They use brass, which is cast,\r\nand not wrought; he does not give the reason of this, although he\r\nmentions the strange effect, namely, if that vessels of this description\r\nfall to the ground, they break like those made of clay.\r\n\r\nThis following custom also is mentioned in accounts of India, that,\r\ninstead of prostrating themselves before their kings, it is usual to\r\naddress them, and all persons in authority and high station, with a\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nThe country produces precious stones, as crystal, carbuncles of all\r\nkinds, and pearls.\r\n\r\n68. As an instance of the disagreement among historians, [CAS. 717] we\r\nmay adduce their (different) accounts of Calanus. They all agree that he\r\naccompanied Alexander, and underwent a voluntary death by fire in his\r\npresence, but they differ as to the manner and cause of his death. Some\r\ngive the following account. Calanus accompanied the king, as the\r\nrehearser of his praises, beyond the boundaries of India, contrary to\r\nthe common Indian custom; for the philosophers attend upon their kings,\r\nand act as instructors in the worship of the gods, in the same manner as\r\nthe Magi attend the Persian kings. When he fell sick at Pasargadæ, being\r\nthen attacked with disease for the first time in his life, he put\r\nhimself to death at the age of seventy-three years, regardless of the\r\nentreaties of the king. A pyre was raised, and a golden couch placed\r\nupon it. He laid down upon it, and covering himself up, was burnt to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOthers say, that a chamber was constructed of wood, which was filled\r\nwith the leaves of trees, and a pyre being raised upon the roof, he was\r\nshut up in it, according to his directions, after the procession, with\r\nwhich he had been accompanied, had arrived at the spot. He threw himself\r\nupon the pyre, and was consumed like a log of wood, together with the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nMegasthenes says, that self-destruction is not a dogma of the\r\nphilosophers, and that those who commit this act are accounted\r\nfool-hardy; that some, who are by nature harsh, inflict wounds upon\r\ntheir bodies, or cast themselves down precipices; those who are\r\nimpatient of pain drown themselves; those who can endure pain strangle\r\nthemselves; and those of ardent tempers throw themselves into the fire.\r\nOf this last description was Calanus, who had no control over himself,\r\nand was a slave to the table of Alexander. Calanus is censured, while\r\nMandanis is applauded. When Alexander’s messengers invited the latter to\r\ncome to the son of Jove, promising a reward if he would comply, and\r\nthreatening punishment if he refused, he answered, “Alexander was not\r\nthe son of Jove, for he did not govern even the smallest portion of the\r\nearth; nor did he himself desire a gift of one who[399] was satisfied\r\nwith nothing. Neither did he fear his threats, for as long as he lived\r\nIndia would supply him with food enough; and when he died, he should be\r\ndelivered from the flesh wasted by old age, and be translated to a\r\nbetter and purer state of existence.” Alexander commended and pardoned\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n69. Historians also relate that the Indians worship Jupiter Ombrius (or,\r\nthe Rainy), the river Ganges, and the indigenous deities of the country;\r\nthat when the king washes his hair,[400] a great feast is celebrated,\r\nand large presents are sent, each person displaying his wealth in\r\ncompetition with his neighbour.\r\n\r\nThey say, that some of the gold-digging myrmeces (ants) have wings; and\r\nthat the rivers, like those of Iberia,[401] bring down gold-dust.\r\n\r\nIn processions at their festivals, many elephants are in the train,\r\nadorned with gold and silver, numerous carriages drawn by four horses\r\nand by several pairs of oxen; then follows a body of attendants in full\r\ndress, (bearing) vessels of gold, large basins and goblets, an\r\norguia[402] in breadth, tables, chairs of state, drinking-cups, and\r\nlavers of Indian copper, most of which were set with precious stones, as\r\nemeralds, beryls, and Indian carbuncles; garments embroidered and\r\ninterwoven with gold; wild beasts, as buffaloes,[403] panthers, tame\r\nlions, and a multitude of birds of variegated plumage and of fine song.\r\n\r\nCleitarchus speaks of four-wheeled carriages bearing trees with large\r\nleaves, from which were suspended (in cages) different kinds of tame\r\nbirds, among which the orion[404] was said to possess the sweetest note,\r\nbut the catreus[405] was the most beautiful in appearance, and had the\r\nmost variegated plumage. In shape it approached nearest to the peacock,\r\nbut the rest of the description must be taken from Cleitarchus.\r\n\r\n70. Opposed to the Brachmanes there are philosophers, called Pramnæ,\r\ncontentious people, and fond of argument. They ridicule the Brachmanes\r\nas boasters and fools for occupying themselves with physiology and\r\nastronomy. Some of the Pramnæ are called Pramnæ of the mountains, others\r\nGymnetæ, others again are called Townsmen and Countrymen. [CAS. 719]\r\nThe Pramnæ of the mountains wear deer-skins, and carry scrips filled\r\nwith roots and drugs; they profess to practise medicine by means of\r\nincantations, charms, and amulets.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnetæ, as their name imports, are naked and live chiefly in the\r\nopen air, practising fortitude for the space of thirty-seven years; this\r\nI have before mentioned; women live in their society, but without\r\ncohabitation. The Gymnetæ are held in singular estimation.\r\n\r\n71. The (Pramnæ) Townsmen are occupied in civil affairs, dwell in\r\ncities, and wear fine linen, or (as Countrymen they live) in the fields,\r\nclothed in the skins of fawns or antelopes. In short, the Indians wear\r\nwhite garments, white linen and muslin, contrary to the accounts of\r\nthose who say that they wear garments of a bright colour; all of them\r\nwear long hair and long beards, plait their hair, and bind it with a\r\nfillet.\r\n\r\n72. Artemidorus says that the Ganges descends from the Emoda mountains\r\nand proceeds towards the south; when it arrives at the city Ganges,[406]\r\nit turns to the east, and keeps this direction as far as\r\nPalibothra,[407] and the mouth by which it discharges itself into the\r\nsea. He calls one of the rivers which flow into it Œdanes,[408] which\r\nbreeds crocodiles and dolphins. Some other circumstances besides are\r\nmentioned by him, but in so confused and negligent a manner that they\r\nare not to be regarded. To these accounts may be added that of Nicolaus\r\nDamascenus.\r\n\r\n73. This writer states that at Antioch, near Daphne,[409] he met with\r\nambassadors from the Indians, who were sent to Augustus Cæsar. It\r\nappeared from the letter that several persons were mentioned in it, but\r\nthree only survived, whom he says he saw. The rest had died chiefly in\r\nconsequence of the length of the journey. The letter was written in\r\nGreek upon a skin; the import of it was, that Porus was the writer, that\r\nalthough he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he highly\r\nesteemed the friendship of Cæsar; that he was willing to allow him a\r\npassage through his country, in whatever part he pleased, and to assist\r\nhim in any undertaking that was just.\r\n\r\nEight naked servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with\r\nperfumes, presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a\r\nHermes (i. e. a man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes,\r\na serpent ten cubits in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in\r\nlength, and a partridge (?) larger than a vulture. They were accompanied\r\nby the person, it is said, who burnt himself to death at Athens. This is\r\nthe practice with persons in distress, who seek escape from existing\r\ncalamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances, as was the case\r\nwith this man. For as everything hitherto had succeeded with him, he\r\nthought it necessary to depart, lest some unexpected calamity should\r\nhappen to him by continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked,\r\nanointed, and with the girdle round his waist, he leaped upon the pyre.\r\nOn his tomb was this inscription,—ZARMANOCHEGAS,[410] AN INDIAN, A\r\nNATIVE OF BARGOSA,[411] HAVING IMMORTALIZED HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE\r\nCUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRY, HERE LIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nARIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Next to India is Ariana, the first portion of the country subject to\r\nthe Persians, lying beyond[412] the Indus, and the first [CAS. 720] of\r\nthe higher satrapies without the Taurus.[413] On the north it is bounded\r\nby the same mountains as India, on the south by the same sea, and by the\r\nsame river Indus, which separates it from India. It stretches thence\r\ntowards the west as far as the line drawn from the Caspian Gates[414] to\r\nCarmania,[415] whence its figure is quadrilateral.\r\n\r\nThe southern side begins from the mouths of the Indus, and from\r\nPatalene, and terminates at Carmania and the mouth of the Persian Gulf,\r\nby a promontory projecting a considerable distance to the south. It then\r\nmakes a bend towards the gulf in the direction of Persia.\r\n\r\nThe Arbies, who have the same name as the river Arbis,[416] are the\r\nfirst inhabitants we meet with in this country. They are separated by\r\nthe Arbis from the next tribe, the Oritæ, and according to Nearchus,\r\noccupy a tract of sea-coast of about 1000 stadia in length; this country\r\nalso is a part of India. Next are the Oritæ, a people governed by their\r\nown laws. The voyage along the coast belonging to this people extends\r\n1800 stadia, that along the country of the Ichthyophagi, who follow\r\nnext, extends 7400 stadia; that along the country of the Carmani as far\r\nas Persia, 3700 stadia. The whole number of stadia is 13,900.\r\n\r\n2. The greater part of the country inhabited by the Ichthyophagi is on a\r\nlevel with the sea. No trees, except palms and a kind of thorn, and the\r\ntamarisk, grow there. There is also a scarcity of water, and of food\r\nproduced by cultivation. Both they and their cattle subsist upon fish,\r\nand are supplied by rain water and wells. The flesh of the animals has\r\nthe smell of fish. Their dwellings are built with the bones of large\r\nwhales and shells, the ribs furnishing beams and supports, and the\r\njaw-bones, door-ways. The vertebral bones serve as mortars in which\r\nfish, which have been previously dried in the sun, are pounded. Of this,\r\nwith the addition of flour, cakes are made; for they have grinding mills\r\n(for corn), although they have no iron. This however is not so\r\nsurprising, because it is possible for them to import it from other\r\nparts. But how do they hollow out the mills again, when worn away? with\r\nthe same stones, they say, with which their arrows and javelins, which\r\nare hardened in the fire, are sharpened. Some fish are dressed in ovens,\r\nbut the greater part is eaten raw. The fish are taken in nets made of\r\nthe bark of the palm.\r\n\r\n3. Above the Ichthyophagi is situated Gedrosia,[417] a country less\r\nexposed to the heat of the sun than India, but more so than the rest of\r\nAsia. As it is without fruits and water, except in summer, it is not\r\nmuch better than the country of the Ichthyophagi. But it produces\r\naromatics, particularly nard and myrrh, in such quantity, that the army\r\nof Alexander used them on the march for tent coverings and beds; they\r\nthus breathed an air full of odours, and at the same time more\r\nsalubrious.\r\n\r\nThe summer was purposely chosen for leaving India, for at that season it\r\nrains in Gedrosia, and the rivers and wells are filled, but in winter\r\nthey fail. The rain falls in the higher parts to the north, and near the\r\nmountains: when the rivers swell, the plains near the sea are watered,\r\nand the wells are also filled. Alexander sent persons before him into\r\nthe desert country to dig wells and to prepare stations for himself and\r\nhis fleet.\r\n\r\n4. Having separated his forces into three divisions, he set out with one\r\ndivision through Gedrosia, keeping at the utmost from the sea not more\r\nthan 500 stadia, in order to secure the coast for his fleet; but he\r\nfrequently approached the sea-side, although the beach was impracticable\r\nand rugged. The second division he sent forward under the command of\r\nCraterus through the interior, with a view of reducing Ariana, and of\r\nproceeding to the same places to which he himself was directing his\r\nmarch. (The third division), the fleet he intrusted to Nearchus and\r\nOnesicritus, his master pilot, giving them orders to [CAS. 721] take up\r\nconvenient positions in following him, and to sail along the coast\r\nparallel to his line of march.\r\n\r\n5. Nearchus says, that while Alexander was on his march, he himself\r\ncommenced his voyage, in the autumn, about the achronical rising of the\r\nPleiades,[418] the wind not being before favourable. The Barbarians\r\nhowever, taking courage at the departure of the king, became daring, and\r\nattempted to throw off their subjection, attacked them, and endeavoured\r\nto drive them out of the country. But Craterus set out from the\r\nHydaspes, and proceeded through the country of the Arachoti and of the\r\nDrangæ into Carmania.\r\n\r\nAlexander was greatly distressed throughout the whole march, as his road\r\nlay through a barren country. The supplies of provisions which he\r\nobtained came from a distance, and were scanty and unfrequent, so much\r\nso that the army suffered greatly from hunger, the beasts of burden\r\ndropped down, and the baggage was abandoned, both on the march and in\r\nthe camp. The army was saved by eating dates and the marrow of the\r\npalm-tree.[419]\r\n\r\nAlexander however (says Nearchus), although acquainted with the\r\nhardships of the enterprise, was ambitious of conducting this large army\r\nin safety, as a conqueror, through the same country where, according to\r\nthe prevailing report, Semiramis escaped by flight from India with about\r\ntwenty, and Cyrus with about seven men.\r\n\r\n6. Besides the want of provisions, the scorching heat was distressing,\r\nas also the deep and burning sand. In some places there were sand-hills,\r\nso that in addition to the difficulty of lifting the legs, as out of a\r\npit, there were ascents and descents. It was necessary also, on account\r\nof the watering places, to make long marches of two, four, and sometimes\r\neven of six hundred stadia, for the most part during the night.\r\nFrequently the encampment was at a distance of 30 stadia from the\r\nwatering places, in order that the soldiers might not be induced by\r\nthirst to drink to excess. For many of them plunged into the water in\r\ntheir armour, and continued drinking until they were drowned; when\r\nswollen after death they floated, and corrupted the shallow water of the\r\ncisterns. Others, exhausted by thirst, lay exposed to the sun, in the\r\nmiddle of the road. They then became tremulous, their hands and their\r\nfeet shook, and they died like persons seized with cold and shivering.\r\nSome turned out of the road to indulge in sleep, overcome with\r\ndrowsiness and fatigue; some were left behind, and perished, being\r\nignorant of the road, destitute of everything, and overpowered by heat.\r\nOthers escaped after great sufferings. A torrent of water, which fell in\r\nthe night time, overwhelmed and destroyed many persons, and much\r\nbaggage; a great part even of the royal equipage was swept away.\r\n\r\nThe guides, through ignorance, deviated so far into the interior, that\r\nthe sea was no longer in sight. The king, perceiving the danger,\r\nimmediately set out in search of the coast; when he had discovered it,\r\nand by sinking wells had found water fit for drinking, he sent for the\r\narmy: afterwards he continued his march for seven days near the shore,\r\nwith a good supply of water. He then again returned into the interior.\r\n\r\n7. There was a plant resembling the laurel, which if eaten by the beasts\r\nof burden caused them to die of epilepsy, accompanied with foaming at\r\nthe mouth. A thorn also, the fruit of which, like gourds, strewed the\r\nground, and was full of a juice; if drops of it fell into the eyes of\r\nany kind of animal it became completely blind. Many persons were\r\nsuffocated by eating unripe dates. Danger also was to be apprehended\r\nfrom serpents; for on the sand-hills there grew a plant, underneath\r\nwhich they crept and hid themselves. The persons wounded by them died.\r\n\r\nThe Oritæ, it was said, smeared the points of their arrows, which were\r\nof wood hardened in the fire, with deadly poisons. When Ptolemy was\r\nwounded and in danger of his life, a person appeared in a dream to\r\nAlexander, and showed him a root with leaves and branches, which he told\r\nhim to bruise and place upon the wound. Alexander awoke from his dream,\r\nand remembering the vision, searched and found the root growing in\r\nabundance, of which both he and others made use; [CAS. 723] when the\r\nBarbarians perceived that the antidote for the poison was discovered,\r\nthey surrendered to the king. It is probable, however, that some one\r\nacquainted with the plant informed the king of its virtues, and that the\r\nfabulous part of the story was invented for the purpose of flattery.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the palace[420] of the Gedrosii on the sixtieth day\r\nafter leaving the Ori,[421] and allowed his army a short period of rest,\r\nhe set out for Carmania.\r\n\r\n8. The position of the southern side of Ariana is thus situated, with\r\nreference to the sea-coast, the country of the Gedrosii and the Oritæ\r\nlying near and above it. A great part of Gedrosia extends into the\r\ninterior until it touches upon the Drangæ, Arachoti, and Paropamisadæ,\r\nof whom Eratosthenes speaks in the following manner: we cannot give a\r\nbetter description. “Ariana,” he says, “is bounded on the east by the\r\nIndus, on the south by the Great Sea, on the north by the Paropamisus\r\nand the succeeding chain of mountains as far as the Caspian Gates, on\r\nthe west by the same limits[422] by which the territory of the Parthians\r\nis separated from Media, and Carmania from Parætacene and Persia.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the country is the length of the Indus, reckoned from the\r\nParopamisus as far as the mouths of that river, and amounts to 12,000,\r\nor according to others to 13,000, stadia. The length, beginning from the\r\nCaspian Gates, as it is laid down in Asiatic Stathmi,[423] is estimated\r\nin two different ways. From the Caspian Gates to Alexandreia among the\r\nArii[424] through Parthia is one and the same road. Then a road leads in\r\na straight line through Bactriana, and over the pass of the mountain to\r\nOrtospana,[425] to the meeting of the three roads from Bactra, which is\r\namong the Paropamisadæ. The other branch turns off a little from Aria\r\ntowards the south to Prophthasia in Drangiana; then the remainder leads\r\nas far as the confines of India and of the Indus; so that the road\r\nthrough the Drangæ and the Arachoti is longer, the whole amounting to\r\n15,300 stadia. But if we deduct 1300 stadia, we shall have the remainder\r\nas the length of the country in a straight line, namely, 14,000 stadia;\r\nfor the length of the coast is not much less, although some persons\r\nincrease this sum by adding to the 10,000 stadia Carmania, which is\r\nreckoned at 6000 stadia. For they seem to reckon it either together with\r\nthe gulfs, or together with the Carmanian coast within the Persian Gulf.\r\nThe name also of Ariana is extended so as to include some part of\r\nPersia, Media, and the north of Bactria and Sogdiana; for these nations\r\nspeak nearly the same language.[426]\r\n\r\n9. The order in which these nations are disposed is as follows. Along\r\nthe Indus are the Paropamisadæ, above whom lies the mountain\r\nParopamisus; then towards the south are the Arachoti; then next to these\r\ntowards the south, the Gedroseni, together with other tribes who occupy\r\nthe sea-coast; the Indus runs parallel along the breadth of these\r\ntracts. The Indians occupy [in part][427] some of the countries situated\r\nalong the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander\r\ndeprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his\r\nown. But Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus in consequence of a\r\nmarriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants.\r\n\r\nThe Arii are situated on the west, by the side of the Paropamisadæ and\r\nthe Drangæ[428] by the Arachoti and Gedrosii. The Arii are situated by\r\nthe side of the Drangæ both on the north and west, and nearly encompass\r\nthem. Bactriana adjoins Aria on the north, and the Paropamisadæ, through\r\nwhose territory Alexander passed when he crossed the Caucasus on his way\r\nto Bactra. Towards the west, next to the Arii, are the Parthians, and\r\nthe parts about the Caspian Gates. Towards the south of Parthia is the\r\ndesert of Carmania; then follows the remainder of Carmania and Gedrosia.\r\n\r\n10. We shall better understand the position of the places about the\r\nabove-mentioned mountainous tract, if we further examine the route which\r\nAlexander took from the Parthian territory to Bactriana, when he was in\r\npursuit of Bessus. He came first to Ariana, next to the Drangæ, where he\r\nput to death Philotas, the son of Parmenio, having detected his\r\ntraitorous intentions. He despatched persons to Ecbatana[429] also\r\n[CAS. 725] to put the father to death as an accomplice in the\r\nconspiracy. It is said that these persons performed in eleven days, upon\r\ndromedaries, a journey of 30 or 40 days, and executed their business.\r\n\r\nThe Drangæ resemble the Persians in all other respects in their mode of\r\nlife, except that they have little wine. Tin is found in the\r\ncountry.[430]\r\n\r\nAlexander next went from the Drangæ to the Euergetæ,[431] (to whom Cyrus\r\ngave this name,) and to the Arachoti; then through the territory of the\r\nParopamisadæ at the setting of the Pleiad.[432] It is a mountainous\r\ncountry, and at that time was covered with snow, so that the march was\r\nperformed with difficulty. The numerous villages, however, on their\r\nmarch, which were well provided with everything except oil, afforded\r\nrelief in their distress. On their left hand were the summits of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe southern parts of the Paropamisus belong to India and Ariana; the\r\nnorthern parts towards the west belong to Bactriana [towards the east to\r\nSogdiana * *[433] Bactrian barbarians]. Having wintered there, with\r\nIndia above to the right hand, and having founded a city, he crossed the\r\nsummits of the mountains into Bactriana. The road was bare of everything\r\nexcept a few trees of the bushy terminthus;[434] the army was driven\r\nfrom want of food to eat the flesh of the beasts of burthen, and that in\r\na raw state for want of firewood; but silphium grew in great abundance,\r\nwhich promoted the digestion of this raw food. Fifteen days after\r\nfounding the city and leaving winter quarters, he came to Adrapsa[435]\r\n(Darapsa?), a city of Bactriana.\r\n\r\n11. Chaarene is situated somewhere about this part of the country\r\nbordering upon India. This, of all the places subject to the Parthians,\r\nlies nearest to India. It is distant 10,000 or 9000 stadia[436] from\r\nBactriana,[437] through the country of the Arachoti, and the\r\nabove-mentioned mountainous tract. Craterus traversed this country,\r\nsubjugating those who refused to submit, and hastened with the greatest\r\nexpedition to form a junction with the king. Nearly about the same time\r\nboth armies, consisting of infantry, entered Carmania together, and at a\r\nshort interval afterwards Nearchus sailed with his fleet into the\r\nPersian Gulf, having undergone great danger and distress from wandering\r\nin his course, and among other causes, from great whales.\r\n\r\n12. It is probable that those who sailed in the expedition greatly\r\nexaggerated many circumstances; yet their statements prove the\r\nsufferings to which they were exposed, and that their apprehensions were\r\ngreater than the real danger. That which alarmed them the most was the\r\nmagnitude of the whales, which occasioned great commotion in the sea\r\nfrom their numbers; their blowing was attended with so great a darkness,\r\nthat the sailors could not see where they stood. But when the pilots\r\ninformed the sailors, who were terrified at the sight and ignorant of\r\nthe cause, that they were animals which might easily be driven away by\r\nthe sound of a trumpet, and by loud noises, Nearchus impelled the\r\nvessels with violence in the direction of the impediment, and at the\r\nsame time frightened the animals with the sound of trumpets. The whales\r\ndived, and again rose at the prow of the vessels, so as to give the\r\nappearance of a naval combat; but they soon made off.\r\n\r\n13. Those who now sail to India speak of the size of these animals and\r\ntheir mode of appearance, but as coming neither in bodies nor\r\nfrequently, yet as repulsed by shouts and by the sound of trumpets. They\r\naffirm that they do not approach the land, but that the bones of those\r\nwhich die, bared of flesh, are readily thrown up by the waves, and\r\nsupply the Ichthyophagi with the above-mentioned material for the\r\nconstruction of their cabins. According to Nearchus, the size of these\r\nanimals is three and twenty orguiæ in length.[438]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 726] Nearchus says that he proved the confident belief of the\r\nsailors in the existence of an island situated in the passage, and\r\ndestructive to those who anchored near it, to be false.\r\n\r\nA bark in its course, when it came opposite to this island, was never\r\nafterwards seen, and some men who were sent in search did not venture to\r\ndisembark upon the island, but shouted and called to the crew, when,\r\nreceiving no answer, they returned. But as all imputed this\r\ndisappearance to the island, Nearchus said that he himself sailed to it,\r\nwent ashore, disembarked with a part of his crew, and went round it. But\r\nnot discovering any trace of those of whom he was in search, he\r\nabandoned the attempt, and informed his men that no fault was to be\r\nimputed to the island (for otherwise destruction would have come upon\r\nhimself and those who disembarked with him), but that some other cause\r\n(and innumerable others were possible) might have occasioned the loss of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\n14. Carmania is the last portion of the sea-coast which begins from the\r\nIndus. Its first promontory projects towards the south into the Great\r\nSea.[439] After it has formed the mouth of the Persian Gulf towards the\r\npromontory, which is in sight, of Arabia Felix, it bends towards the\r\nPersian Gulf, and is continued till it touches Persia.\r\n\r\nCarmania is large, situated in the interior, and extending itself\r\nbetween Gedrosia and Persia, but stretches more to the north than\r\nGedrosia. This is indicated by its fertility, for it not only produces\r\neverything, but the trees are of a large size, excepting however the\r\nolive; it is also watered by rivers. Gedrosia also differs little from\r\nthe country of the Ichthyophagi, so that frequently there is no produce\r\nfrom the ground. They therefore keep the annual produce in store for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\nOnesicritus says, that a river in Carmania brings down gold-dust; that\r\nthere are mines of silver, copper, and minium; and that there are two\r\nmountains, one of which contains arsenic, the other salt.\r\n\r\nThere belongs to it a desert tract, which is contiguous to Parthia and\r\nParætacene. The produce of the ground is like that of Persia; and among\r\nother productions the vine. The Carmanian vine, as we call it, often\r\nbears bunches of grapes of two cubits in size; the seeds are very\r\nnumerous and very large; probably the plant grows in its native soil\r\nwith great luxuriance.\r\n\r\nAsses, on account of the scarcity of horses, are generally made use of\r\neven in war. They sacrifice an ass to Mars, who is the only deity\r\nworshipped by them, for they are a warlike people. No one marries before\r\nhe has cut off the head of an enemy and presented it to the king, who\r\ndeposits the scull in the royal treasury. The tongue is minced and mixed\r\nwith flour, which the king, after tasting it, gives to the person who\r\nbrought it, to be eaten by himself and his family. That king is the most\r\nhighly respected, to whom the greatest number of heads are presented.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nearchus, most of the customs and the language of the\r\ninhabitants of Carmania resemble those of the Persians and Medes.\r\n\r\nThe passage across the mouth of the Persian Gulf does not occupy more\r\nthan one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Next to Carmania is Persis. A great part of it extends along the\r\ncoast of the Gulf, which has its name from the country, but a much\r\nlarger portion stretches into the interior, and particularly in its\r\nlength, reckoned from the south, and Carmania to the north, and to the\r\nnations of Media.\r\n\r\nIt is of a threefold character, as we regard its natural condition and\r\nthe quality of the air. First, the coast, extending for about 4400 or\r\n4300 stadia, is burnt up with heat; it is sandy, producing little except\r\npalm trees, and terminates at the greatest river in those parts, the\r\nname of which is Oroatis.[440] Secondly, the country above the coast\r\nproduces everything, and is a plain; it is excellently adapted for the\r\nrearing of cattle, and abounds with rivers and lakes.\r\n\r\nThe third portion lies towards the north, and is bleak and mountainous.\r\nOn its borders live the camel-breeders.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 727] Its length, according to Eratosthenes, towards the north and\r\nMedia,[441] is about 8000, or, including some projecting promontories,\r\n9000 stadia; the remainder (from Media) to the Caspian Gates is not more\r\nthan 3000 stadia. The breadth in the interior of the country from Susa\r\nto Persepolis is 4200 stadia, and thence to the borders of Carmania 1600\r\nstadia more.\r\n\r\nThe tribes inhabiting this country are those called the Pateischoreis,\r\nthe Achæmenidæ, and Magi; these last affect a sedate mode of life; the\r\nCurtii and Mardi are robbers, the rest are husbandmen.\r\n\r\n2. Susis also is almost a part of Persis. It lies between Persis and\r\nBabylonia, and has a very considerable city, Susa. For the Persians and\r\nCyrus, after the conquest of the Medes, perceiving that their own\r\ncountry was situated towards the extremities, but Susis more towards the\r\ninterior, nearer also to Babylon and the other nations, there placed the\r\nroyal seat of the empire. They were pleased with its situation on the\r\nconfines of Persis, and with the importance of the city; besides the\r\nconsideration that it had never of itself undertaken any great\r\nenterprise, had always been in subjection to other people, and\r\nconstituted a part of a greater body, except, perhaps, anciently in the\r\nheroic times.\r\n\r\nIt is said to have been founded by Tithonus, the father of Memnon. Its\r\ncompass was 120 stadia. Its shape was oblong. The Acropolis was called\r\nMemnonium. The Susians have the name also of Cissii. Æschylus[442] calls\r\nthe mother of Memnon, Cissia. Memnon is said to be buried near Paltus in\r\nSyria, by the river Badas, as Simonides says in his Memnon, a\r\ndithyrambic poem among the Deliaca. The wall of the city, the temples\r\nand palaces, were constructed in the same manner as those of the\r\nBabylonians, of baked brick and asphaltus, as some writers relate.\r\nPolycletus however says, that its circumference was 200 stadia, and that\r\nit was without walls.\r\n\r\n3. They embellished the palace at Susa more than the rest, but they did\r\nnot hold in less veneration and honour the palaces at Persepolis and\r\nPasargadæ.[443] For in these stronger and hereditary places were the\r\ntreasure-house, the riches, and tombs of the Persians. There was another\r\npalace at Gabæ, in the upper parts of Persia, and another on the\r\nsea-coast, near a place called Taoce.[444]\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things during the empire of the Persians. But\r\nafterwards different princes occupied different palaces; some, as was\r\nnatural, less sumptuous, after the power of Persis had been reduced\r\nfirst by the Macedonians, and secondly still more by the Parthians. For\r\nalthough the Persians have still a kingly government, and a king of\r\ntheir own, yet their power is very much diminished, and they are subject\r\nto the king of Parthia.\r\n\r\n4. Susa is situated in the interior, upon the river Choaspes, beyond the\r\nbridge; but the territory extends to the sea: and the sea-coast of this\r\nterritory, from the borders of the Persian coast nearly as far as the\r\nmouths of the Tigris, is a distance of about 3000 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe Choaspes flows through Susis, terminating on the same coast, and has\r\nits source in the territory of the Uxii.[445] For a rugged and\r\nprecipitous range of mountains lies between the Susians and Persis, with\r\nnarrow defiles, difficult to pass; they were inhabited by robbers, who\r\nconstantly exacted payment even from the kings themselves, at their\r\nentrance into Persis from Susis.\r\n\r\nPolycletus says, that the Choaspes, and the Eulæus,[446] and the Tigris\r\nalso enter a lake, and thence discharge themselves into the sea; that on\r\nthe side of the lake is a mart, as the rivers do not receive the\r\nmerchandise from the sea, nor convey it down to the sea, on account of\r\ndams in the river, purposely constructed, and that the goods are\r\ntransported by land a distance of 800 stadia[447] to Susa; according to\r\nothers, the rivers which flow through Susis discharge themselves by the\r\nintermediate canals of the Euphrates into the single stream of the\r\nTigris, which on this account has at its mouth the name of Pasitigris.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 729] 5. According to Nearchus, the sea-coast of Susis is swampy,\r\nand terminates at the river Euphrates; at its mouth is a village, which\r\nreceives the merchandise from Arabia; for the coast of Arabia approaches\r\nclose to the mouths of the Euphrates and the Pasitigris; the whole\r\nintermediate space is occupied by a lake which receives the Tigris; on\r\nsailing up the Pasitigris 150 stadia is the bridge of rafts leading to\r\nSusa from Persis, and is distant from Susa 60 (600?) stadia; the\r\nPasitigris is distant from the Oroatis about 2000 stadia; the ascent\r\nthrough the lake to the mouth of the Tigris is 600 (6000?) stadia;[448]\r\nnear the mouth stands the Susian village (Aginis), distant from Susa 500\r\nstadia; the journey by water from the mouth of the Euphrates, up to\r\nBabylon, through a well-inhabited tract of country, is a distance of\r\nmore than 3000 stadia.\r\n\r\nOnesicritus says that all the rivers discharge themselves into the lake,\r\nboth the Euphrates and the Tigris; and that the Euphrates, again issuing\r\nfrom the lake, discharges itself into the sea by a separate mouth.\r\n\r\n6. There are many other narrow defiles in passing out through the\r\nterritory of the Uxii, and entering Persis. These Alexander forced in\r\nhis march through the country at the Persian Gates, and at other places,\r\nwhen he was hastening to see the principal parts of Persis, and the\r\ntreasure-holds, in which wealth had been accumulated during the long\r\nperiod that Asia was tributary to Persis.\r\n\r\nHe crossed many rivers, which flow through the country and discharge\r\nthemselves into the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nNext to the Choaspes are the Copratas[449] and the Pasitigris, which has\r\nits source in the country of the Uxii. There is also the river Cyrus,\r\nwhich flows through Cœle Persis,[450] as it is called, near Pasargadæ.\r\nThe king changed his name, which was formerly Agradatus, to that of this\r\nriver. Alexander crossed the Araxes[451] close to Persepolis. Persepolis\r\nwas distinguished for the magnificence of the treasures which it\r\ncontained. The Araxes flows out of the Parætacene,[452] and receives the\r\nMedus,[453] which has its source in Media. These rivers run through a\r\nvery fruitful valley, which, like Persepolis, lies close to Carmania\r\nand to the eastern parts of the country. Alexander burnt the palace at\r\nPersepolis, to avenge the Greeks, whose temples and cities the Persians\r\nhad destroyed by fire and sword.\r\n\r\n7. He next came to Pasargadæ,[454] which also was an ancient royal\r\nresidence. Here he saw in a park the tomb of Cyrus. It was a small\r\ntower, concealed within a thick plantation of trees solid below, but\r\nabove consisting of one story and a shrine which had a very narrow\r\nopening; Aristobulus says, he entered through this opening, by order of\r\nAlexander, and decorated the tomb. He saw there a golden couch, a table\r\nwith cups, a golden coffin, and a large quantity of garments and dresses\r\nornamented with precious stones. These objects he saw at his first\r\nvisit, but on a subsequent visit the place had been robbed, and\r\neverything had been removed except the couch and the coffin which were\r\nonly broken. The dead body had been removed from its place; whence it\r\nwas evident that it was the act not of the Satrap,[455] but of robbers,\r\nwho had left behind what they could not easily carry off. And this\r\noccurred although there was a guard of Magi stationed about the place,\r\nwho received for their daily subsistence a sheep, and every month a\r\nhorse.[456] The remote distance to which the army of Alexander had\r\nadvanced, to Bactra and India, gave occasion to the introduction of many\r\ndisorderly acts, and to this among others.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of Aristobulus, who records the following\r\ninscription on the tomb. “O MAN, I AM CYRUS,[457] I ESTABLISHED THE\r\nPERSIAN EMPIRE AND WAS KING OF ASIA. GRUDGE ME NOT THEREFORE THIS\r\nMONUMENT.”\r\n\r\nOnesicritus however says that the tower had ten stories, that Cyrus lay\r\nin the uppermost, and that there was an inscription in Greek, cut in\r\nPersian letters, “I CYRUS, KING OF KINGS, LIE HERE.” And another\r\ninscription to the same effect in the Persian language.\r\n\r\n8. Onesicritus mentions also this inscription on the tomb of Darius: “I\r\nWAS A FRIEND TO MY FRIENDS, I WAS THE FIRST OF HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS, I\r\nEXCELLED AS HUNTER, I COULD DO EVERYTHING.”\r\n\r\n[CAS. 730] Aristus of Salamis, a writer of a much later age than these,\r\nsays, that the tower consisted of two stories, and was large; that it\r\nwas built at the time the Persians succeeded to the kingdom (of the\r\nMedes); that the tomb was preserved; that the above-mentioned\r\ninscription was in the Greek, and that there was another to the same\r\npurport in the Persian language.\r\n\r\nCyrus held in honour Pasargadæ, because he there conquered, in his last\r\nbattle, Astyages the Mede, and transferred to himself the empire of\r\nAsia; he raised it to the rank of a city, and built a palace in memory\r\nof his victory.\r\n\r\n9. Alexander transferred everything that was precious in Persis to Susa,\r\nwhich was itself full of treasures and costly materials; he did not,\r\nhowever, consider this place, but Babylon, as the royal residence, and\r\nintended to embellish it. There too his treasure was deposited.\r\n\r\nThey say that, besides the treasures in Babylon and in the camp of\r\nAlexander, which were not included in the sum, the treasure found at\r\nSusa and in Persis was reckoned to amount to 40,000, and according to\r\nsome writers to 50,000, talents. But others say, that the whole\r\ntreasure, collected from all quarters, and transported to Ecbatana,\r\namounted to 180,000 talents, and that the 8,000 talents which Darius\r\ncarried away with him in his flight from Media became the booty of those\r\nwho put him to death.\r\n\r\n10. Alexander preferred Babylon, because he saw that it far surpassed\r\nthe other cities in magnitude, and had other advantages. Although Susis\r\nis fertile, it has a glowing and scorching atmosphere, particularly near\r\nthe city, as he (Aristobulus?) says. Lizards and serpents at mid-day in\r\nthe summer, when the sun is at its greatest height, cannot cross the\r\nstreets of the city quick enough to prevent their being burnt to death\r\nmidway by the heat. This happens nowhere in Persis, although it lies\r\nmore towards the south.\r\n\r\nCold water for baths is suddenly heated by exposure to the sun. Barley\r\nspread out in the sun is roasted[458] like barley prepared in ovens. For\r\nthis reason earth is laid to the depth of two cubits upon the roofs of\r\nthe houses. They are obliged to construct their houses narrow, on\r\naccount of the weight placed upon them, and from want of long beams,\r\nbut, as large dwellings are required to obviate the suffocating heat,\r\nthe houses are long.\r\n\r\nThe beam made of the palm tree has a peculiar property, for although it\r\nretains its solidity, it does not as it grows old give way downwards,\r\nbut curves upwards with the weight, and is a better support to the roof.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the scorching heat is said to be high, overhanging\r\nmountains on the north, which intercept the northern winds. These,\r\nblowing from the tops of the mountains at a great height, fly over\r\nwithout touching the plains, to the more southern parts of Susis. There\r\nthe air is still, particularly when the Etesian winds cool the other\r\nparts of the country which are burnt up by heat.\r\n\r\n11. Susis is so fertile in grain, that barley and wheat produce,\r\ngenerally, one hundred, and sometimes two hundred fold. Hence the\r\nfurrows are not ploughed close together, for the roots when crowded\r\nimpede the sprouting of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe vine did not grow there before the Macedonians planted it, both\r\nthere and at Babylon. They do not dig trenches, but thrust down into the\r\nground iron-headed stakes, which when drawn out are immediately replaced\r\nby the plants.\r\n\r\nSuch is the character of the inland parts. The sea-coast is marshy and\r\nwithout harbours; hence Nearchus says, that he met with no native\r\nguides, when coasting with his fleet from India to Babylonia, for\r\nnowhere could his vessels put in, nor was he able to procure persons who\r\ncould direct him by their knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n12. The part of Babylonia formerly called Sitacene, and afterwards\r\nApolloniatis,[459] is situated near Susis.\r\n\r\nAbove both, on the north and towards the east, are the Elymæi[460] and\r\nthe Parætaceni, predatory people relying for security on their situation\r\nin a rugged and mountainous country. The Parætaceni lie more immediately\r\nabove the Apolloniatæ, and therefore annoy them the more. The Elymæi are\r\nat war with this people and with the Susians, and the Uxii with the\r\nElymæi, but not so constantly at present as might be expected, on\r\naccount of the power of the Parthians, to whom all the inhabitants\r\n[CAS. 732] of those regions are under subjection. When therefore the\r\nParthians are quiet, all are tranquil, and their subject nations. But\r\nwhen, as frequently happens, there is an insurrection, which has\r\noccurred even in our own times, the event is not the same to all, but\r\ndifferent to different people. For the disturbance has benefited some,\r\nbut disappointed the expectation of others.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of the countries of Persis and Susiana.\r\n\r\n13. The manners and customs of the Persians are the same as those of the\r\nSusians and the Medes, and many other people; and they have been\r\ndescribed by several writers, yet I must mention what is suitable to my\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe Persians do not erect statues nor altars, but, considering the\r\nheaven as Jupiter, sacrifice on a high place.[461] They worship the sun\r\nalso, whom they call Mithras, the moon, Venus, fire, earth, winds, and\r\nwater. They sacrifice, having offered up prayers, in a place free from\r\nimpurities, and present the victim crowned.[462]\r\n\r\nAfter the Magus, who directs the sacrifice, has divided the flesh, each\r\ngoes away with his share, without setting apart any portion to the gods;\r\nfor the god, they say, requires the soul of the victim, and nothing\r\nmore. Nevertheless, according to some writers, they lay a small piece of\r\nthe caul upon the fire.\r\n\r\n14. But it is to fire and water especially that they offer sacrifice.\r\nThey throw upon the fire dry wood without the bark, and place fat over\r\nit; they then pour oil upon it, and light it below; they do not blow the\r\nflame with their breath, but fan it; those who have blown the flame with\r\ntheir breath, or thrown any dead thing or dirt upon the fire, are put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThey sacrifice to water by going to a lake, river, or fountain; having\r\ndug a pit, they slaughter the victim over it, taking care that none of\r\nthe pure water near be sprinkled with blood, and thus be polluted. They\r\nthen lay the flesh in order upon myrtle or laurel branches; the Magi\r\ntouch it with slender twigs,[463] and make incantations, pouring oil\r\nmixed with milk and honey, not into the fire, nor into the water, but\r\nupon the earth. They continue their incantations for a long time,\r\nholding in the hands a bundle of slender myrtle rods.\r\n\r\n15. In Cappadocia (for in this country there is a great body of Magi,\r\ncalled Pyræthi,[464] and there are many temples dedicated to the Persian\r\ndeities) the sacrifice is not performed with a knife, but the victim is\r\nbeaten to death with a log of wood, as with a mallet.\r\n\r\nThe Persians have also certain large shrines, called Pyrætheia.[465] In\r\nthe middle of these is an altar, on which is a great quantity of ashes,\r\nwhere the Magi maintain an unextinguished fire. They enter daily, and\r\ncontinue their incantation for nearly an hour, holding before the fire a\r\nbundle of rods, and wear round their heads high turbans of felt,\r\nreaching down on each side so as to cover the lips and the sides of the\r\ncheeks. The same customs are observed in the temples of Anaïtis and of\r\nOmanus. Belonging to these temples are shrines, and a wooden statue of\r\nOmanus is carried in procession. These we have seen ourselves.[466]\r\nOther usages, and such as follow, are related by historians.\r\n\r\n16. The Persians never pollute a river with urine, nor wash nor bathe in\r\nit; they never throw a dead body, nor anything unclean, into it. To\r\nwhatever god they intend to sacrifice, they first address a prayer to\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n17. They are governed by hereditary kings. Disobedience is punished by\r\nthe head and arms being cut off, and the body cast forth. They marry\r\nmany women, and maintain at the same time a great number of concubines,\r\nwith a view to a numerous offspring.\r\n\r\nThe kings propose annual prizes for a numerous family of children.\r\nChildren are not brought into the presence of their parents until they\r\nare four years old.\r\n\r\nMarriages are celebrated at the beginning of the vernal equinox. The\r\nbridegroom passes into the bride-chamber, having previously eaten some\r\nfruit, or camel’s marrow, but nothing else during the day.\r\n\r\n18. From the age of five to twenty-four years they are taught to use the\r\nbow, to throw the javelin, to ride, and to speak the truth. They have\r\nthe most virtuous preceptors, [CAS. 733] who interweave useful fables\r\nin their discourses, and rehearse, sometimes with, sometimes without,\r\nmusic, the actions of the gods and of illustrious men.\r\n\r\nThe youths are called to rise before day-break, at the sound of brazen\r\ninstruments, and assemble in one spot, as if for arming themselves or\r\nfor the chase. They are arranged in companies of fifty, to each of which\r\none of the king’s or a satrap’s son is appointed as leader, who runs,\r\nfollowed at command by the others, an appointed distance of thirty or\r\nforty stadia.\r\n\r\nThey require them to give an account of each lesson, when they practise\r\nloud speaking, and exercise the breath and lungs. They are taught to\r\nendure heat, cold, and rains; to cross torrents, and keep their armour\r\nand clothes dry; to pasture animals, to watch all night in the open air,\r\nand to eat wild fruits, as the terminthus,[467] acorns, and wild pears.\r\n\r\n[These persons are called Cardaces, who live upon plunder, for “carda”\r\nmeans a manly and warlike spirit.][468]\r\n\r\nThe daily food after the exercise of the gymnasium is bread, a cake,\r\ncardamum,[469] a piece of salt, and dressed meat either roasted or\r\nboiled, and their drink is water.\r\n\r\nTheir mode of hunting is by throwing spears from horseback, or with\r\nthe bow or the sling.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they are employed in planting trees, cutting roots,\r\nfabricating armour, and making lines and nets. The youth do not eat the\r\ngame, but carry it home. The king gives rewards for running, and to the\r\nvictors in the other contests of the pentathla (or five games). The\r\nyouths are adorned with gold, esteeming it for its fiery appearance.\r\nThey do not ornament the dead with gold, nor apply fire to them, on\r\naccount of its being an object of veneration.\r\n\r\n19. They serve as soldiers in subordinate stations, and in those of\r\ncommand from twenty to fifty years of age, both on foot and on\r\nhorseback. They do not concern themselves with the public markets, for\r\nthey neither buy nor sell. They are armed with a romb-shaped shield.\r\nBesides quivers, they have battle-axes and short swords. On their heads\r\nthey wear a cap rising like a tower. The breastplate is composed of\r\nscales of iron.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the chiefs consists of triple drawers, a double tunic with\r\nsleeves reaching to the knees; the under garment is white, the upper of\r\na variegated colour. The cloak for summer is of a purple or violet\r\ncolour, but for winter of a variegated colour. The turbans are similar\r\nto those of the Magi; and a deep double shoe. The generality of people\r\nwear a double tunic reaching to the half of the leg. A piece of fine\r\nlinen is wrapped round the head. Each person has a bow and a sling.\r\n\r\nThe entertainments of the Persians are expensive. They set upon their\r\ntable entire animals in great number, and of various kinds. Their\r\ncouches, drinking-cups, and other articles are so brilliantly ornamented\r\nthat they gleam with gold and silver.\r\n\r\n20. Their consultations on the most important affairs are carried on\r\nwhile they are drinking, and they consider the resolutions made at that\r\ntime more to be depended upon than those made when sober.\r\n\r\nOn meeting persons of their acquaintance, and of equal rank with\r\nthemselves, on the road, they approach and kiss them, but to persons of\r\nan inferior station they offer the cheek, and in that manner receive the\r\nkiss. But to persons of still lower condition they only bend the body.\r\n\r\nTheir mode of burial is to smear the bodies over with wax, and then to\r\ninter them. The Magi are not buried, but the birds are allowed to devour\r\nthem. These persons, according to the usage of the country, espouse even\r\ntheir mothers.\r\n\r\nSuch are the customs of the Persians.\r\n\r\n21. The following, mentioned by Polvcletus, are perhaps customary\r\npractices:\r\n\r\nAt Susa each king builds in the citadel, as memorials of the\r\nadministration of his government, a dwelling for himself,\r\ntreasure-houses, and magazines for tribute collected (in kind).\r\n\r\nFrom the sea-coast they obtain silver, from the interior the [CAS. 735]\r\nproduce of each province, as dyes, drugs, hair, wool, or anything else\r\nof this sort, and cattle. The apportionment of the tribute was settled\r\nby Darius [Longimanus, who was a very handsome person with the exception\r\nof the length of his arms, which reached to his knees].[470] The greater\r\npart both of gold and silver is wrought up, and there is not much in\r\ncoined money. The former they consider as best adapted for presents, and\r\nfor depositing in store-houses. So much coined money as suffices for\r\ntheir wants they think enough; but, on the other hand, money is coined\r\nin proportion to what is required for expenditure.[471]\r\n\r\n22. Their habits are in general temperate. But their kings, from the\r\ngreat wealth which they possessed, degenerated into a luxurious way of\r\nlife. They sent for wheat from Assos in Æolia, for Chalybonian[472] wine\r\nfrom Syria, and water from the Eulæus, which is the lightest of all, for\r\nan Attic cotylus measure of it weighs less by a drachm (than the same\r\nquantity of any other water).\r\n\r\n23. Of the barbarians the Persians were the best known to the Greeks,\r\nfor none of the other barbarians who governed Asia governed Greece. The\r\nbarbarians were not acquainted with the Greeks, and the Greeks were but\r\nslightly acquainted, and by distant report only, with the barbarians. As\r\nan instance, Homer was not acquainted with the empire of the Syrians nor\r\nof the Medes, for otherwise as he mentions the wealth of Egyptian Thebes\r\nand of Phœnicia, he would not have passed over in silence the wealth of\r\nBabylon, of Ninus, and of Ecbatana.\r\n\r\nThe Persians were the first people that brought Greeks under their\r\ndominion; the Lydians (before them) did the same, they were not however\r\nmasters of the whole, but of a small portion only of Asia, that within\r\nthe river Halys; their empire lasted for a short time, during the reigns\r\nof Crœsus and Alyattes; and they were deprived of what little glory they\r\nhad acquired, when conquered by the Persians.\r\n\r\nThe Persians, (on the contrary, increased in power and,) as soon as they\r\nhad destroyed the Median empire, subdued the Lydians and brought the\r\nGreeks of Asia under their dominion. At a later period they even passed\r\nover into Greece and were worsted in many great battles, but still they\r\ncontinued to keep possession of Asia, as far as the places on the\r\nsea-coast, until they were completely subdued by the Macedonians.\r\n\r\n24. The founder of their empire was Cyrus. He was succeeded by his son\r\nCambyses, who was put to death by the Magi. The seven Persians who\r\nkilled the Magi delivered the kingdom into the hands of Darius, the son\r\nof Hystaspes. The succession terminated with Arses, whom Bagous the\r\neunuch having killed set up Darius, who was not of the royal family.\r\nAlexander overthrew Darius, and reigned himself twelve years.[473] The\r\nempire of Asia was partitioned out among his successors, and transmitted\r\nto their descendants, but was dissolved after it had lasted about two\r\nhundred and fifty years.[474]\r\n\r\nAt present the Persians are a separate people, governed by kings, who\r\nare subject to other kings; to the kings of Macedon in former times, but\r\nnow to those of Parthia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVI. [CAS. 736]\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n   The sixteenth Book contains Assyria, in which are the great\r\n   cities Babylon and Nisibis; Adiabene, Mesopotamia, all Syria;\r\n   Phœnicia, Palestine; the whole of Arabia; all that part of\r\n   India which touches upon Arabia; the territory of the\r\n   Saracens, called by our author Scenitis; and the whole country\r\n   bordering the Dead and Red Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ASSYRIA is contiguous to Persia and Susiana. This name is given to\r\nBabylonia, and to a large tract of country around; this tract contains\r\nAturia,[475] in which is Nineveh, the Apolloniatis, the Elymæi, the\r\nParætacæ, and the Chalonitis about Mount Zagrum,[476]—the plains about\r\nNineveh, namely, Dolomene, Calachene, Chazene, and Adiabene,—the nations\r\nof Mesopotamia, bordering upon the Gordyæi;[477] the Mygdones about\r\nNisibis, extending to the Zeugma[478] of the Euphrates, and to the great\r\nrange of country on the other side that river, occupied by Arabians, and\r\nby those people who are properly called Syrians in the present age. This\r\nlast people extend as far as the Cilicians, Phœnicians, and Jews, to the\r\nsea opposite the Sea of Egypt, and to the Bay of Issus.\r\n\r\n2. The name of Syrians seems to extend from Babylonia as far as the Bay\r\nof Issus, and, anciently, from this bay to the Euxine.\r\n\r\nBoth tribes of the Cappadocians, those near the Taurus and those near\r\nthe Pontus, are called to this time Leuco-Syrians (or White\r\nSyrians),[479] as though there existed a nation of Black Syrians. These\r\nare the people situated beyond the Taurus, and I extend the name of\r\nTaurus as far as the Amanus.[480]\r\n\r\nWhen the historians of the Syrian empire say that the Medes were\r\noverthrown by the Persians, and the Syrians by the Medes, they mean no\r\nother Syrians than those who built the royal palaces at Babylon and\r\nNineveh; and Ninus, who built Nineveh in Aturia, was one of these\r\nSyrians. His wife, who succeeded her husband, and founded Babylon, was\r\nSemiramis. These sovereigns were masters of Asia. Many other works of\r\nSemiramis, besides those at Babylon, are extant in almost every part of\r\nthis continent, as, for example, artificial mounds, which are called\r\nmounds of Semiramis, and walls[481] and fortresses, with subterraneous\r\npassages; cisterns for water; roads[482] to facilitate the ascent of\r\nmountains; canals communicating with rivers and lakes; roads and\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nThe empire they left continued with their successors to the time of [the\r\ncontest between] Sardanapalus and Arbaces.[483] It was afterwards\r\ntransferred to the Medes.\r\n\r\n3. The city Nineveh was destroyed immediately upon the overthrow of the\r\nSyrians.[484] It was much larger than Babylon, and situated in the plain\r\nof Aturia. Aturia borders upon the places about Arbela; between these is\r\nthe river Lycus.[485] Arbela and the parts about it[486] belong to\r\nBabylonia. In the country on the other side of the Lycus are the plains\r\nof Aturia, which surround Nineveh.[487]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 737] In Aturia is situated Gaugamela, a village where Darius was\r\ndefeated and lost his kingdom. This place is remarkable for its name,\r\nwhich, when interpreted, signifies the Camel’s House. Darius, the son of\r\nHystaspes, gave it this name, and assigned (the revenues of) the place\r\nfor the maintenance of a camel, which had undergone the greatest\r\npossible labour and fatigue in the journey through the deserts of\r\nScythia, when carrying baggage and provision for the king. The\r\nMacedonians, observing that this was a mean village, but Arbela a\r\nconsiderable settlement (founded, as it is said, by Arbelus, son of\r\nAthmoneus), reported that the battle was fought and the victory obtained\r\nnear Arbela, which account was transmitted to historians.\r\n\r\n4. After Arbela and the mountain Nicatorium[488] (a name which\r\nAlexander, after the victory at Arbela, superadded), is the river\r\nCaprus,[489] situated at the same distance from Arbela as the Lycus. The\r\ncountry is called Artacene.[490] Near Arbela is the city Demetrias; next\r\nis the spring of naphtha, the fires, the temple of the goddess\r\nAnæa,[491] Sadracæ, the palace of Darius, son of Hystaspes, the\r\nCyparisson, or plantation of Cypresses, and the passage across the\r\nCaprus, which is close to Seleucia and Babylon.\r\n\r\n5. Babylon itself also is situated in a plain. The wall is 385[492]\r\nstadia in circumference, and 32 feet in thickness. The height of the\r\nspace between the towers is 50, and of the towers 60 cubits. The roadway\r\nupon the walls will allow chariots with four horses when they meet to\r\npass each other with ease. Whence, among the seven wonders of the world,\r\nare reckoned this wall and the hanging garden: the shape of the garden\r\nis a square, and each side of it measures four plethra. It consists of\r\nvaulted terraces, raised one above another, and resting upon cube-shaped\r\npillars. These are hollow and filled with earth to allow trees of the\r\nlargest size to be planted. The pillars, the vaults, and the terraces\r\nare constructed of baked brick and asphalt.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to the highest story is by stairs, and at their side are\r\nwater engines, by means of which persons, appointed expressly for the\r\npurpose, are continually employed in raising water from the Euphrates\r\ninto the garden. For the river, which is a stadium in breadth, flows\r\nthrough the middle of the city, and the garden is on the side of the\r\nriver. The tomb also of Belus is there. At present it is in ruins,\r\nhaving been demolished, as it is said, by Xerxes. It was a quadrangular\r\npyramid of baked brick, a stadium in height, and each of the sides a\r\nstadium in length. Alexander intended to repair it. It was a great\r\nundertaking, and required a long time for its completion (for ten\r\nthousand men were occupied two months in clearing away the mound of\r\nearth), so that he was not able to execute what he had attempted, before\r\ndisease hurried him rapidly to his end. None of the persons who\r\nsucceeded him attended to this undertaking; other works also were\r\nneglected, and the city was dilapidated, partly by the Persians, partly\r\nby time, and, through the indifference of the Macedonians to things of\r\nthis kind, particularly after Seleucus Nicator had fortified Seleucia on\r\nthe Tigris near Babylon, at the distance of about 300 stadia.\r\n\r\nBoth this prince and all his successors directed their care to that\r\ncity, and transferred to it the seat of empire. At present it is larger\r\nthan Babylon; the other is in great part deserted, so that no one would\r\nhesitate to apply to it what one of the comic writers said of\r\nMegalopolitæ in Arcadia,\r\n\r\n   “The great city is a great desert.”\r\n\r\nOn account of the scarcity of timber, the beams and pillars of the\r\nhouses were made of palm wood. They wind ropes of twisted reed round the\r\npillars, paint them over with colours, and draw designs upon them; they\r\ncover the doors with a coat of asphaltus. These are lofty, and all the\r\nhouses are vaulted on account of the want of timber. For the country is\r\nbare, a great part of it is covered with shrubs, and produces [CAS.\r\n739] nothing but the palm. This tree grows in the greatest abundance in\r\nBabylonia. It is found in Susiana also in great quantity, on the Persian\r\ncoast, and in Carmania.\r\n\r\nThey do not use tiles for their houses, because there are no great\r\nrains. The case is the same in Susiana and in Sitacene.\r\n\r\n6. In Babylon a residence was set apart for the native philosophers\r\ncalled Chaldæans, who are chiefly devoted to the study of astronomy.\r\nSome, who are not approved of by the rest, profess to understand\r\ngenethlialogy, or the casting of nativities. There is also a tribe of\r\nChaldæans, who inhabit a district of Babylonia, in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Arabians, and of the sea called the Persian Sea.[493] There are\r\nseveral classes of the Chaldæan astronomers. Some have the name of\r\nOrcheni, some Borsippeni, and many others, as if divided into sects, who\r\ndisseminate different tenets on the same subjects. The mathematicians\r\nmake mention of some individuals among them, as Cidenas, Naburianus, and\r\nSudinus. Seleucus also of Seleuceia is a Chaldæan, and many other\r\nremarkable men.\r\n\r\n7. Borsippa is a city sacred to Diana and Apollo. Here is a large linen\r\nmanufactory. Bats of much larger size than those in other parts abound\r\nin it. They are caught and salted for food.\r\n\r\n8. The country of the Babylonians is surrounded on the east by the\r\nSusans, Elymæi, and Parætaceni; on the south by the Persian Gulf, and\r\nthe Chaldæans as far as the Arabian Meseni; on the west by the Arabian\r\nScenitæ as far as Adiabene and Gordyæa; on the north by the Armenians\r\nand Medes as far as the Zagrus, and the nations about that river.\r\n\r\n9. The country is intersected by many rivers, the largest of which are\r\nthe Euphrates and the Tigris: next to the Indian rivers, the rivers in\r\nthe southern parts of Asia are said to hold the second place. The Tigris\r\nis navigable upwards from its mouth to Opis,[494] and to the present\r\nSeleuceia. Opis is a village and a mart for the surrounding places. The\r\nEuphrates also is navigable up to Babylon, a distance of more than 3000\r\nstadia. The Persians, through fear of incursions from without, and for\r\nthe purpose of preventing vessels from ascending these rivers,\r\nconstructed artificial cataracts. Alexander, on arriving there,\r\ndestroyed as many of them as he could, those particularly [on the Tigris\r\nfrom the sea] to Opis. But he bestowed great care upon the canals; for\r\nthe Euphrates, at the commencement of summer, overflows. It begins fill\r\nin the spring, when the snow in Armenia melts: the ploughed land,\r\ntherefore, would be covered with water and be submerged, unless the\r\noverflow of the superabundant water were diverted by trenches and\r\ncanals, as in Egypt the water of the Nile is diverted. Hence the origin\r\nof canals. Great labour is requisite for their maintenance, for the soil\r\nis deep, soft, and yielding, so that it would easily be swept away by\r\nthe stream; the fields would be laid bare, the canals filled, and the\r\naccumulation of mud would soon obstruct their mouths. Then, again, the\r\nexcess of water discharging itself into the plains near the sea forms\r\nlakes, and marshes, and reed-grounds, supplying the reeds with which all\r\nkinds of platted vessels are woven; some of these vessels are capable of\r\nholding water, when covered over with asphaltus; others are used with\r\nthe material in its natural state. Sails are also made of reeds; these\r\nresemble mats or hurdles.\r\n\r\n10. It is not, perhaps, possible to prevent inundations of this kind\r\naltogether, but it is the duty of good princes to afford all possible\r\nassistance. The assistance required is to prevent excessive overflow by\r\nthe construction of dams, and to obviate the filling of rivers, produced\r\nby the accumulation of mud, by cleansing the canals, and removing\r\nstoppages at their mouths. The cleansing of the canals is easily\r\nperformed, but the construction of dams requires the labour of numerous\r\nworkmen. For the earth being soft and yielding, does not support the\r\nsuperincumbent mass, which sinks, and is itself carried away, and thus a\r\ndifficulty arises in making dams at the mouth. Expedition is necessary\r\nin closing the canals to prevent all the water flowing out. When the\r\ncanals dry up in the summer time, they cause the river to dry up also;\r\nand if the river is low (before the canals are closed), it cannot supply\r\nthe canals in time with water, of which the country, burnt up and\r\nscorched, requires a very large quantity; [CAS. 740] for there is no\r\ndifference, whether the crops are flooded by an excess or perish by\r\ndrought and a failure of water. The navigation up the rivers (a source\r\nof many advantages) is continually obstructed by both the\r\nabove-mentioned causes, and it is not possible to remedy this unless the\r\nmouths of the canals were quickly opened and quickly closed, and the\r\ncanals were made to contain and preserve a mean between excess and\r\ndeficiency of water.\r\n\r\n11. Aristobulus relates that Alexander himself, when he was sailing up\r\nthe river, and directing the course of the boat, inspected the canals,\r\nand ordered them to be cleared by his multitude of followers; he\r\nlikewise stopped up some of the mouths, and opened others. He observed\r\nthat one of these canals, which took a direction more immediately to the\r\nmarshes, and to the lakes in front of Arabia, had a mouth very difficult\r\nto be dealt with, and which could not be easily closed on account of the\r\nsoft and yielding nature of the soil; he (therefore) opened a new mouth\r\nat the distance of 30 stadia, selecting a place with a rocky bottom, and\r\nto this the current was diverted. But in doing this he was taking\r\nprecautions that Arabia should not become entirely inaccessible in\r\nconsequence of the lakes and marshes, as it was already almost an island\r\nfrom the quantity of water (which surrounded it). For he contemplated\r\nmaking himself master of this country; and he had already provided a\r\nfleet and places of rendezvous; and had built vessels in Phœnicia and at\r\nCyprus, some of which were in separate pieces, others were in parts,\r\nfastened together by bolts. These, after being conveyed to Thapsacus in\r\nseven distances of a day’s march, were then to be transported down the\r\nriver to Babylon. He constructed other boats in Babylonia, from cypress\r\ntrees in the groves and parks, for there is a scarcity of timber in\r\nBabylonia. Among the Cossæi, and some other tribes, the supply of timber\r\nis not great.\r\n\r\nThe pretext for the war, says Aristobulus, was that the Arabians were\r\nthe only people who did not send their ambassadors to Alexander; but the\r\ntrue reason was his ambition to be lord of all.\r\n\r\nWhen he was informed that they worshipped two deities only, Jupiter and\r\nBacchus, who supply what is most requisite for the subsistence of\r\nmankind, he supposed that, after his conquests, they would worship him\r\nas a third, if he permitted them to enjoy their former national\r\nindependence. Thus was Alexander employed in clearing the canals, and in\r\nexamining minutely the sepulchres of the kings, most of which are\r\nsituated among the lakes.\r\n\r\n12. Eratosthenes, when he is speaking of the lakes near Arabia, says,\r\nthat the water, when it cannot find an outlet, opens passages\r\nunder-ground, and is conveyed through these as far as the\r\nCœle-Syrians,[495] it is also compressed and forced into the parts near\r\nRhinocolura[496] and Mount Casius,[497] and there forms lakes and deep\r\npits.[498] But I know not whether this is probable. For the overflowings\r\nof the water of the Euphrates, which form the lakes and marshes near\r\nArabia, are near the Persian Sea. But the isthmus which separates them\r\nis neither large nor rocky, so that it was more probable that the water\r\nforced its way in this direction into the sea, either under the ground,\r\nor across the surface, than that it traversed so dry and parched a soil\r\nfor more than 6000 stadia; particularly, when we observe, situated\r\nmidway in this course, Libanus, Antilibanus, and Mount Casius.[499]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 742] Such, then, are the accounts of Eratosthenes and\r\nAristobulus.\r\n\r\n13. But Polycleitus says, that the Euphrates does not overflow its\r\nbanks, because its course is through large plains; that of the mountains\r\n(from which it is supplied), some are distant 2000, and the Cossæan\r\nmountains scarcely 1000 stadia, that they are not very high, nor covered\r\nwith snow to a great depth, and therefore do not occasion the snow to\r\nmelt in great masses, for the most elevated mountains are in the\r\nnorthern parts above Ecbatana; towards the south they are divided,\r\nspread out, and are much lower; the Tigris also receives the greater\r\npart of the water [which comes down from them], and thus overflows its\r\nbanks.[500]\r\n\r\nThe last assertion is evidently absurd, because the Tigris descends into\r\nthe same plains (as the Euphrates); and the above-mentioned mountains\r\nare not of the same height, the northern being more elevated, the\r\nsouthern extending in breadth, but are of a lower altitude. The quantity\r\nof snow is not, however, to be estimated by altitude only, but by\r\naspect. The same mountain has more snow on the northern than on the\r\nsouthern side, and the snow continues longer on the former than on the\r\nlatter. As the Tigris therefore receives from the most southern parts of\r\nArmenia, which are near Babylon, the water of the melted snow, of which\r\nthere is no great quantity, since it comes from the southern side, it\r\nshould overflow in a less degree than the Euphrates, which receives the\r\nwater from both parts (northern and southern); and not from a single\r\nmountain only, but from many, as I have mentioned in the description of\r\nArmenia. To this we must add the length of the river, the large tract of\r\ncountry which it traverses in the Greater and in the Lesser Armenia, the\r\nlarge space it takes in its course in passing out of the Lesser Armenia\r\nand Cappadocia, after issuing out of the Taurus in its way to Thapsacus\r\n(forming the boundary between Syria below and Mesopotamia), and the\r\nlarge remaining portion of country as far as Babylon and to its mouth, a\r\ncourse in all of 36,000 stadia.\r\n\r\nThis, then, on the subject of the canals (of Babylonia).\r\n\r\n14. Babylonia produces barley in larger quantity than any other[501]\r\ncountry, for a produce of three hundred-fold is spoken of. The palm tree\r\nfurnishes everything else, bread, wine, vinegar, and meal; all kinds of\r\nwoven articles are also procured from it. Braziers use the stones of the\r\nfruit instead of charcoal. When softened by being soaked in water, they\r\nare food for fattening oxen and sheep.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there is a Persian song in which are reckoned up 360\r\nuseful properties of the palm.\r\n\r\nThey employ for the most part the oil of sesamum, a plant which is rare\r\nin other places.\r\n\r\n15. Asphaltus is found in great abundance in Babylonia. Eratosthenes\r\ndescribes it as follows.\r\n\r\nThe liquid asphaltus, which is called naphtha, is found in Susiana; the\r\ndry kind, which can be made solid, in Babylonia. There is a spring of it\r\nnear the Euphrates. When this river overflows at the time of the melting\r\nof the snow, the spring also of asphaltus is filled, and overflows into\r\nthe river, where large clods are consolidated, fit for buildings\r\nconstructed of baked bricks. Others say that the liquid kind also is\r\nfound in Babylonia. With respect to the solid kind, I have described its\r\ngreat utility in the construction of buildings. They say that boats (of\r\nreeds) are woven,[502] which, when besmeared with asphaltus, are firmly\r\ncompacted. The liquid kind, called naphtha, is of a singular nature.\r\nWhen it is brought near the fire, the fire catches it; and if a body\r\nsmeared over with it is brought near the fire, it burns with a flame,\r\nwhich it is impossible to extinguish, except with a large quantity of\r\nwater; with a small quantity it burns more violently, but it may be\r\nsmothered and extinguished by mud, vinegar, alum, and glue. It is said\r\nthat Alexander, as an experiment, ordered naphtha to be poured over a\r\nboy in a bath, and a lamp to be brought near his body. The boy became\r\nenveloped in flames, and would have perished if the bystanders had not\r\nmastered the fire by pouring upon him a great quantity of water, and\r\nthus saved his life.\r\n\r\nPoseidonius says that there are springs of naphtha in Babylonia, some of\r\nwhich produce white, others black, naphtha; the first of these, I mean\r\nthe white naphtha, which attracts flame, [CAS. 743] is liquid sulphur;\r\nthe second, or black naphtha, is liquid asphaltus, and is burnt in lamps\r\ninstead of oil.\r\n\r\n16. In former times the capital of Assyria was Babylon; it is now called\r\nSeleuceia upon the Tigris. Near it is a large village called Ctesiphon.\r\nThis the Parthian kings usually made their winter residence, with a view\r\nto spare the Seleucians the burden of furnishing quarters for the\r\nScythian soldiery. In consequence of the power of Parthia,\r\nCtesiphon[503] may be considered as a city rather than a village; from\r\nits size it is capable of lodging a great multitude of people; it has\r\nbeen adorned with public buildings by the Parthians, and has furnished\r\nmerchandise, and given rise to arts profitable to its masters.\r\n\r\nThe kings usually passed the winter there, on account of the salubrity\r\nof the air, and the summer at Ecbatana and in Hyrcania,[504] induced by\r\nthe ancient renown of these places.\r\n\r\nAs we call the country Babylonia, so we call the people Babylonians, not\r\nfrom the name of the city, but of the country; the case is not precisely\r\nthe same, however, as regards even natives of Seleuceia, as, for\r\ninstance, Diogenes, the stoic philosopher [who had the appellation of\r\nthe Babylonian, and not the Seleucian].[505]\r\n\r\n17. At the distance of 500 stadia from Seleuceia is Artemita, a\r\nconsiderable city, situated nearly directly to the east, which is the\r\nposition also of Sitacene.[506] This extensive and fertile tract of\r\ncountry lies between Babylon and Susiana, so that the whole road in\r\ntravelling from Babylon to Susa passes through Sitacene. The road from\r\nSusa[507] into the interior of Persis, through the territory of the\r\nUxii,[508] and from Persis into the middle of Carmania,[509] leads also\r\ntowards the east.\r\n\r\nPersis, which is a large country, encompasses Carmania on the\r\n[west][510] and north. Close to it adjoin Parætacene,[511] and the\r\nCossæan territory as far as the Caspian Gates, inhabited by mountainous\r\nand predatory tribes. Contiguous to Susiana is Elymaïs, a great part of\r\nwhich is rugged, and inhabited by robbers. To Elymaïs adjoin the country\r\nabout the Zagrus[512] and Media.[513]\r\n\r\n18. The Cossæi, like the neighbouring mountaineers, are for the most\r\npart archers, and are always out on foraging parties. For as they occupy\r\na country of small extent, and barren, they are compelled by necessity\r\nto live at the expense of others. They are also necessarily powerful,\r\nfor they are all fighting men. When the Elymæi were at war with the\r\nBabylonians and Susians, they supplied the Elymæi with thirteen thousand\r\nauxiliaries.\r\n\r\nThe Parætaceni attend to the cultivation of the ground more than the\r\nCossæi, but even these people do not abstain from robbery.\r\n\r\nThe Elymæi occupy a country larger in extent, and more varied, than that\r\nof the Parætaceni. The fertile part of it is inhabited by husbandmen.\r\nThe mountainous tract is a nursery for soldiers, the greatest part of\r\nwhom are archers. As it is of considerable extent, it can furnish a\r\ngreat military force; their king, who possesses great power, refuses to\r\nbe subject, like others, to the king of Parthia. The country was\r\nsimilarly independent in the time of the Persians, and afterwards[514]\r\nin the time of the Macedonians, who governed Syria. When Antiochus the\r\nGreat attempted to plunder the temple of Belus, the neighbouring\r\nbarbarians, unassisted, attacked and put him to death. In after-times\r\nthe king of Parthia[515] heard that the temples in their country\r\ncontained great wealth, but knowing that the people would not submit,\r\nand admonished by the fate of Antiochus, he invaded their country with a\r\nlarge army; he took the temple of Minerva, and that of Diana, called\r\nAzara, and carried away treasure to the amount of 10,000 [CAS. 744]\r\ntalents. Seleuceia also, a large city on the river Hedyphon,[516] was\r\ntaken. It was formerly called Soloce.\r\n\r\nThere are three convenient entrances into this country; one from Media\r\nand the places about the Zagrus, through Massabatice; a second from\r\nSusis, through the district Gabiane. Both Gabiane and Massabatice are\r\nprovinces of Elymæa. A third passage is that from Persis. Corbiane also\r\nis a province of Elymaïs.\r\n\r\nSagapeni and Silaceni, small principalities, border upon Elymaïs.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the number and the character of the nations situated\r\nabove Babylonia towards the east.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Media and Armenia lie to the north, and Adiabene and\r\nMesopotamia to the west of Babylonia.\r\n\r\n19. The greatest part of Adiabene consists of plains, and, although it\r\nis a portion of Babylon, has its own prince. In some places it is\r\ncontiguous to Armenia.[517] For the Medes, Armenians, and Babylonians,\r\nthe three greatest nations in these parts, were from the first in the\r\npractice, on convenient opportunities, of waging continual war with each\r\nother, and then making peace, which state of things continued till the\r\nestablishment of the Parthian empire.\r\n\r\nThe Parthians subdued the Medes and Babylonians, but never at any time\r\nconquered the Armenians. They made frequent inroads into their country,\r\nbut the people were not subdued, and Tigranes, as I have mentioned in\r\nthe description of Armenia,[518] opposed them with great vigour and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of Adiabene. The Adiabeni are also called\r\nSaccopodes.[519]\r\n\r\nWe shall describe Mesopotamia and the nations towards the south, after\r\npremising a short account of the customs of the Assyrians.\r\n\r\n20. Their other customs are like those of the Persians, but this is\r\npeculiar to themselves: three discreet persons, chiefs of each tribe,\r\nare appointed, who present publicly young women who are marriageable,\r\nand give notice by the crier, beginning with those most in estimation,\r\nof a sale of them to men intending to become husbands. In this manner\r\nmarriages are contracted.\r\n\r\nAs often as the parties have sexual intercourse with one another, they\r\nrise, each apart from the other, to burn perfumes. In the morning they\r\nwash, before touching any household vessel. For as ablution is customary\r\nafter touching a dead body, so it is practised after sexual\r\nintercourse.[520] There is a custom prescribed by an oracle for all the\r\nBabylonian women to have intercourse with strangers. The women repair to\r\na temple of Venus, accompanied by numerous attendants and a crowd of\r\npeople. Each woman has a cord round her head. The man approaches a\r\nwoman, and places on her lap as much money as he thinks proper; he then\r\nleads her away to a distance from the sacred grove, and has intercourse\r\nwith her. The money is considered as consecrated to Venus.\r\n\r\nThere are three tribunals, one consisting of persons who are past\r\nmilitary service, another of nobles, and a third of old men, besides\r\nanother appointed by the king. It is the business of the latter[521] to\r\ndispose of the virgins in marriage, and to determine causes respecting\r\nadultery; of another to decide those relative to theft; and of the\r\nthird, those of assault and violence.\r\n\r\nThe sick are brought out of their houses into the highways, and inquiry\r\nis made of passengers whether any of them can give information of a\r\nremedy for the disease. There is no one so ill-disposed as not to accost\r\nthe sick person, and acquaint [CAS. 745] him with anything that he\r\nconsiders may conduce to his recovery.\r\n\r\nTheir dress is a tunic reaching to the feet, an upper garment of wool,\r\n[and] a white cloak. The hair is long. They wear a shoe resembling a\r\nbuskin. They wear also a seal, and carry a staff not plain, but with a\r\nfigure upon the top of it, as an apple, a rose, a lily, or something of\r\nthe kind. They anoint themselves with oil of sesamum. They bewail the\r\ndead, like the Egyptians and many other nations. They bury the body in\r\nhoney, first besmearing it with wax.\r\n\r\nThere are three communities which have no corn. They live in the\r\nmarshes, and subsist on fish. Their mode of life is like that of the\r\ninhabitants of Gedrosia.[522]\r\n\r\n21. Mesopotamia has its name from an accidental circumstance. We have\r\nsaid that it is situated between the Euphrates and the Tigris, that the\r\nTigris washes its eastern side only, and the Euphrates its western and\r\nsouthern sides. To the north is the Taurus, which separates Armenia from\r\nMesopotamia. The greatest distance by which they are separated from each\r\nother is that towards the mountains. This distance may be the same which\r\nEratosthenes mentions, and is reckoned from Thapsacus,[523] where there\r\nwas the (Zeugma) old bridge of the Euphrates, to the (Zeugma) passage\r\nover the Tigris, where Alexander crossed it, a distance, that is, of\r\n2400 stadia. The least distance between them is somewhere about\r\nSeleuceia and Babylon, and is a little more than 200 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe Tigris flows through the middle of the lake called Thopitis[524] in\r\nthe direction of its breadth, and after traversing it to the opposite\r\nbank, sinks under ground with a loud noise and rushing of air. Its\r\ncourse is for a long space invisible, but it rises again to the surface\r\nnot far from Gordyæa. According to Eratosthenes, it traverses the lake\r\nwith such rapidity, that although the lake is saline and without\r\nfish,[525] yet in this part it is fresh, has a current, and abounds with\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n22. The contracted shape of Mesopotamia extends far in length, and\r\nsomewhat resembles a ship. The Euphrates forms the larger part of its\r\nboundary. The distance from Thapsacus to Babylon, according to\r\nEratosthenes, is 4800 stadia, and from the (Zeugma)[526] bridge in\r\nCommagene, where Mesopotamia begins, to Thapsacus, is not less than 2000\r\nstadia.\r\n\r\n23. The country lying at the foot of the mountains is very fertile. The\r\npeople, called by the Macedonians Mygdones, occupy the parts towards the\r\nEuphrates, and both Zeugmata, that is, the Zeugma in Commagene, and the\r\nancient Zeugma at Thapsacus. In their territory is Nisibis,[527] which\r\nthey called also Antioch in Mygdonia, situated below Mount Masius,[528]\r\nand Tigranocerta,[529] and the places about Carrhæ, Nicephorium,[530]\r\nChordiraza,[531] and Sinnaca, where Crassus was taken prisoner by\r\nstratagem, and put to death by Surena, the Parthian general.[532]\r\n\r\n24. Near the Tigris are the places belonging to the Gordyæi,[533] whom\r\nthe ancients called Carduchi; their cities are Sareisa, Satalca, and\r\nPinaca, a very strong fortress with three citadels, each enclosed by its\r\nown wall, so that it is as it were a triple city. It was, however,\r\nsubject to the king of Armenia; the Romans also took it by storm,\r\nalthough the Gordyæi had the reputation of excelling in the art of\r\nbuilding, and to be skilful in the construction of siege engines. It was\r\nfor this reason Tigranes took them into his service. The rest of\r\nMesopotamia (Gordyæa?) was subject to the Romans. Pompey assigned to\r\nTigranes the largest and best portion of the country; for it has fine\r\npastures, is rich in plants, and produces evergreens and an aromatic,\r\nthe amomum. It breeds lions also. It furnishes naphtha, and the stone\r\ncalled Gangitis,[534] which drives away reptiles.\r\n\r\n25. Gordys, the son of Triptolemus, is related to have colonized\r\nGordyene. The Eretrians[535] afterwards, who were carried away by force\r\nby the Persians, settled here. We shall soon speak of Triptolemus in our\r\ndescription of Syria.\r\n\r\n26. The parts of Mesopotamia inclining to the south, and [CAS. 747] at\r\na distance from the mountains, are an arid and barren district, occupied\r\nby the Arabian Scenitæ, a tribe of robbers and shepherds, who readily\r\nmove from place to place, whenever pasture or booty begin to be\r\nexhausted. The country lying at the foot of the mountains is harassed\r\nboth by these people and by the Armenians. They are situated above, and\r\nkeep them in subjection by force. It is at last subject for the most\r\npart to these people, or to the Parthians, who are situated at their\r\nside, and possess both Media and Babylonia.\r\n\r\n27. Between the Tigris and the Euphrates flows a river called Basileios\r\n(or the Royal river), and about Anthemusia another called the\r\nAborrhas.[536] The road for merchants going from Syria to Seleuceia and\r\nBabylon lies through the country of the (Arabian) Scenitæ, [now called\r\nMalii,][537] and through the desert belonging to their territory. The\r\nEuphrates is crossed in the latitude of Anthemusia, a place in\r\nMesopotamia.[538] Above the river, at the distance of four schœni, is\r\nBambyce, which is called by the names of Edessa and Hierapolis,[539]\r\nwhere the Syrian goddess Atargatis is worshipped. After crossing the\r\nriver, the road lies through a desert country on the borders of\r\nBabylonia to Scenæ, a considerable city, situated on the banks of a\r\ncanal. From the passage across the river to Scenæ is a journey of five\r\nand twenty days. There are (on the road) owners of camels, who keep\r\nresting-places, which are well supplied with water from cisterns, or\r\ntransported from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe Scenitæ exact a moderate tribute from merchants, but [otherwise] do\r\nnot molest them: the merchants, therefore, avoid the country on the\r\nbanks of the river, and risk a journey through the desert, leaving the\r\nriver on the right hand at a distance of nearly three days’ march. For\r\nthe chiefs of the tribes living on both banks of the river, who occupy\r\nnot indeed a fertile territory, yet one less sterile than the rest (of\r\nthe country), are settled in the midst of their own peculiar domains,\r\nand each exacts a tribute of no moderate amount for himself. And it is\r\ndifficult among so large a body of people, and of such daring habits, to\r\nestablish any common standard of tribute advantageous to the merchant.\r\n\r\nScenæ is distant from Seleuceia 18 schœni.\r\n\r\n28. The Euphrates and its eastern banks are the boundaries of the\r\nParthian empire. The Romans and the chiefs of the Arabian tribes occupy\r\nthe parts on this side the Euphrates as far as Babylonia. Some of the\r\nchiefs attach themselves in preference to the Parthians, others to the\r\nRomans, to whom they adjoin. The Scenitæ nomades, who live near the\r\nriver, are less friendly to the Romans than those tribes who are\r\nsituated at a distance near Arabia Felix. The Parthians were once\r\nsolicitous of conciliating the friendship of the Romans, but having\r\nrepulsed Crassus,[540] who began the war with them, they suffered\r\nreprisals, when they themselves commenced hostilities, and sent Pacorus\r\ninto Asia.[541] But Antony, following the advice of the Armenian,[542]\r\nwas betrayed, and was unsuccessful (against them). Phraates, his[543]\r\nsuccessor, was so anxious to obtain the friendship of Augustus Cæsar,\r\nthat he even sent the trophies, which the Parthians had set up as\r\nmemorials of [CAS. 748] the defeat of the Romans. He also invited Titius\r\nto a conference, who was at that time præfect of Syria, and delivered\r\ninto his hands, as hostages, four of his legitimate sons, Seraspadanes,\r\nRhodaspes, Phraates, and Bonones, with two of their wives and four of\r\ntheir sons; for he was apprehensive of conspiracy and attempts on his\r\nlife.[544] He knew that no one could prevail against him, unless he was\r\nopposed by one of the Arsacian family, to which race the Parthians were\r\nstrongly attached. He therefore removed the sons out of his way, with a\r\nview of annihilating the hopes of the disaffected.\r\n\r\nThe surviving sons, who live at Rome, are entertained as princes at the\r\npublic expense. The other kings (his successors) have continued to send\r\nambassadors (to Rome), and to hold conferences (with the Roman\r\npræfects).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Syria is bounded on the north by Cilicia and the mountain Amanus;\r\nfrom the sea to the bridge on the Euphrates (that is, from the Issic Bay\r\nto the Zeugma in Commagene) is a distance of 1400 stadia, and forms the\r\nabove-mentioned (northern) boundary; on the east it is bounded by the\r\nEuphrates and the Arabian Scenitæ, who live on this side the Euphrates;\r\non the south, by Arabia Felix and Egypt; on the west, by the Egyptian\r\nand Syrian Seas as far as Issus.\r\n\r\n2. Beginning from Cilicia and Mount Amanus, we set down as parts of\r\nSyria, Commagene, and the Seleucis of Syria, as it is called, then\r\nCœle-Syria, lastly, on the coast, Phœnicia, and in the interior, Judæa.\r\nSome writers divide the whole of Syria into Cœlo-Syrians, Syrians, and\r\nPhœnicians, and say that there are intermixed with these four other\r\nnations, Jews, Idumæans, Gazæans, and Azotii, some of whom are\r\nhusbandmen, as the Syrians and Cœlo-Syrians, and others merchants, as\r\nthe Phœnicians.\r\n\r\n3. This is the general description [of Syria].[545]\r\n\r\nIn describing it in detail, we say that Commagene is rather a small\r\ndistrict. It contains a strong city, Samosata, in which was the seat of\r\nthe kings. At present it is a (Roman) province. A very fertile but small\r\nterritory lies around it. Here is now the Zeugma, or bridge, of the\r\nEuphrates, and near it is situated Seleuceia, a fortress of Mesopotamia,\r\nassigned by Pompey to the Commageneans. Here Tigranes confined in prison\r\nfor some time and put to death Selene, surnamed Cleopatra, after she was\r\ndispossessed of Syria.[546]\r\n\r\n4. Seleucis is the best of the above-mentioned portions of Syria. It is\r\ncalled and is a Tetrapolis, and derives its name from the four\r\ndistinguished cities which it contains; for there are more than four\r\ncities, but the four largest are Antioch Epidaphne,[547] Seleuceia in\r\nPieria,[548] Apameia,[549] and Laodiceia.[550] They were called Sisters\r\nfrom the concord which existed between them. They were founded by\r\nSeleucus Nicator. The largest bore the name of his father, and the\r\nstrongest his own. Of the others, Apameia had its name from his wife\r\nApama, and Laodiceia from his mother.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with its character of Tetrapolis, Seleucis, according to\r\nPoseidonius, was divided into four satrapies; Cœle-Syria into the same\r\nnumber, but [Commagene, like] Mesopotamia, consisted of one.[551]\r\n\r\nAntioch also is a Tetrapolis, consisting (as the name implies) [CAS.\r\n750] of four portions, each of which has its own, and all of them a\r\ncommon wall.[552]\r\n\r\n[Seleucus] Nicator founded the first of these portions, transferring\r\nthither settlers from Antigonia, which a short time before Antigonus,\r\nson of Philip, had built near it. The second was built by the general\r\nbody of settlers; the third by Seleucus, the son of Callinicus; the\r\nfourth by Antiochus, the son of Epiphanes.\r\n\r\n5. Antioch is the metropolis of Syria. A palace was constructed there\r\nfor the princes of the country. It is not much inferior in riches and\r\nmagnitude to Seleuceia on the Tigris and Alexandreia in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[Seleucus] Nicator settled here the descendants of Triptolemus, whom we\r\nhave mentioned a little before.[553] On this account the people of\r\nAntioch regard him as a hero, and celebrate a festival to his honour on\r\nMount Casius[554] near Seleuceia. They say that when he was sent by the\r\nArgives in search of Io, who first disappeared at Tyre, he wandered\r\nthrough Cilicia; that some of his Argive companions separated from him\r\nand founded Tarsus; that the rest attended him along the sea-coast, and,\r\nrelinquishing their search, settled with him on the banks of the\r\nOrontes;[555] that Gordys the son of Triptolemus, with some of those who\r\nhad accompanied his father, founded a colony in Gordyæa, and that the\r\ndescendants of the rest became settlers among the inhabitants of\r\nAntioch.\r\n\r\n6. Daphne,[556] a town of moderate size, is situated above Antioch at\r\nthe distance of 40 stadia. Here is a large forest, with a thick covert\r\nof shade and springs of water flowing through it. In the midst of the\r\nforest is a sacred grove, which is a sanctuary, and a temple of Apollo\r\nand Diana. It is the custom for the inhabitants of Antioch and the\r\nneighbouring people to assemble here to celebrate public festivals. The\r\nforest is 80 stadia in circumference.\r\n\r\n7. The river Orontes flows near the city. Its source is in Cœle-Syria.\r\nHaving taken its course under-ground, it reäppears, traverses the\r\nterritory of Apameia to Antioch, approaching the latter city, and then\r\ndescends to the sea at Seleuceia. The name of the river was formerly\r\nTyphon, but was changed to Orontes, from the name of the person who\r\nconstructed the bridge over it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the fable, it was somewhere here that Typhon was struck\r\nwith lightning, and here also was the scene of the fable of the Arimi,\r\nwhom we have before mentioned.[557] Typhon was a serpent, it is said,\r\nand being struck by lightning, endeavoured to make its escape, and\r\nsought refuge in the ground; it deeply furrowed the earth, and (as it\r\nmoved along) formed the bed of the river; having descended under-ground,\r\nit caused a spring to break out, and from Typhon the river had its name.\r\n\r\nOn the west the sea, into which the Orontes discharges itself, is\r\nsituated below Antioch in Seleuceia, which is distant from the mouth of\r\nthe river 40, and from Antioch 120 stadia. The ascent by the river to\r\nAntioch is performed in one day.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Antioch are the Euphrates, Bambyce,[558] Berœa,[559] and\r\nHeracleia, small towns formerly under the government of Dionysius, the\r\nson of Heracleon. Heracleia is distant 20 stadia from the temple of\r\nDiana Cyrrhestis.\r\n\r\n8. Then follows the district of Cyrrhestica,[560] which extends as far\r\nas that of Antioch. On the north near it are Mount Amanus and Commagene.\r\nCyrrhestica extends as far as these places, and touches them. Here is\r\nsituated a city, Gindarus, the acropolis of Cyrrhestica, and a\r\nconvenient resort for robbers, and near it a place called Heracleium. It\r\nwas near these places that Pacorus, the eldest of the sons of the\r\nParthian king, who had invaded Syria, was defeated by Ventidius, and\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nPagræ,[561] in the district of Antioch, is close to Gindarus. It [CAS.\r\n751] is a strong fortress situated on the pass over the Amanus, which\r\nleads from the gates of the Amanus into Syria. Below Pagræ lies the\r\nplain of Antioch, through which flow the rivers Arceuthus, Orontes, and\r\nLabotas.[562] In this plain is also the trench of Meleagrus, and the\r\nriver Œnoparas,[563] on the banks of which Ptolemy Philometor, after\r\nhaving defeated Alexander Balas, died of his wounds.[564]\r\n\r\nAbove these places is a hill called Trapezon from its form,[565] and\r\nupon it Ventidius engaged Phranicates[566] the Parthian general.\r\n\r\nAfter these places, near the sea, are Seleuceia[567] and Pieria, a\r\nmountain continuous with the Amanus and Rhosus, situated between Issus\r\nand Seleuceia.\r\n\r\nSeleuceia formerly had the name of Hydatopotami (rivers of water). It is\r\na considerable fortress, and may defy all attacks; wherefore Pompey,\r\nhaving excluded from it Tigranes, declared it a free city.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Antioch is Apameia, situated in the interior, and to the\r\nsouth of Seleuceia, the mountains Casius and Anti-Casius.\r\n\r\nStill further on from Seleuceia are the mouths of the Orontes, then the\r\nNymphæum, a kind of sacred cave, next Casium, then follows\r\nPoseidium[568] a small city, and Heracleia.[569]\r\n\r\n9. Then follows Laodiceia, situated on the sea; it is a very well-built\r\ncity, with a good harbour; the territory, besides its fertility in other\r\nrespects, abounds with wine, of which the greatest part is exported to\r\nAlexandreia. The whole mountain overhanging the city is planted almost\r\nto its summit with vines. The summit of the mountain is at a great\r\ndistance from Laodiceia, sloping gently and by degrees upwards from the\r\ncity; but it rises perpendicularly over Apameia.\r\n\r\nLaodiceia suffered severely when Dolabella took refuge there. Being\r\nbesieged by Cassius, he defended it until his death, but he involved in\r\nhis own ruin the destruction of many parts of the city.[570]\r\n\r\n10. In the district of Apameia is a city well fortified in almost every\r\npart. For it consists of a well-fortified hill, situated in a hollow\r\nplain, and almost surrounded by the Orontes, which, passing by a large\r\nlake in the neighbourhood, flows through wide-spread marshes and meadows\r\nof vast extent, affording pasture for cattle and horses.[571] The city\r\nis thus securely situated, and received the name Cherrhonesus (or the\r\npeninsula) from the nature of its position. It is well supplied from a\r\nvery large fertile tract of country, through which the Orontes flows\r\nwith numerous windings. Seleucus Nicator, and succeeding kings, kept\r\nthere five hundred elephants, and the greater part of their army.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly called Pella by the first Macedonians, because most of\r\nthe soldiers of the Macedonian army had settled there; for Pella, the\r\nnative place of Philip and Alexander, was held to be the metropolis of\r\nthe Macedonians. Here also the soldiers were mustered, and the breed of\r\nhorses kept up. There were in the royal stud more than thirty thousand\r\nbrood mares and three hundred stallions. Here were employed\r\ncolt-breakers, instructors in the method of fighting in heavy armour,\r\nand all who were paid to teach the arts of war.\r\n\r\nThe power Trypho, surnamed Diodotus, acquired is a proof of the\r\ninfluence of this place; for when he aimed at the empire of Syria, he\r\nmade Apameia the centre of his operations. He was born at Casiana, a\r\nstrong fortress in the Apameian district, and educated in Apameia; he\r\nwas a favourite of the king and the persons about the court. When he\r\nattempted to effect a revolution in the state, he obtained his supplies\r\nfrom Apameia and from the neighbouring cities, Larisa,[572] Casiana,\r\nMegara, Apollonia, and others like them, all of which were reckoned to\r\nbelong to the district of Apameia. He was proclaimed king of this\r\ncountry, and maintained his sovereignty for a long time. Cæcilius\r\nBassus, at the head of two legions, caused Apameia to revolt, and was\r\nbesieged by two large Roman armies, but his resistance was so vigorous\r\nand long that he only surrendered voluntarily and on his own\r\nconditions.[573] For the country supplied his army with provisions,\r\n[CAS. 753] and a great many of the chiefs of the neighbouring tribes\r\nwere his allies, who possessed strongholds, among which was Lysias,\r\nsituated above the lake, near Apameia, Arethusa,[574] belonging to\r\nSampsiceramus and Iamblichus his son, chiefs of the tribe of the\r\nEmeseni.[575] At no great distance were Heliopolis and Chalcis,[576]\r\nwhich were subject to Ptolemy, son of Mennæus,[577] who possessed the\r\nMassyas[578] and the mountainous country of the Ituræans. Among the\r\nauxiliaries of Bassus was Alchædamnus,[579] king of the Rhambæi, a tribe\r\nof the Nomades on this side of the Euphrates. He was a friend of the\r\nRomans, but, considering himself as having been unjustly treated by\r\ntheir governors, he retired to Mesopotamia, and then became a tributary\r\nof Bassus. Poseidonius the Stoic was a native of this place, a man of\r\nthe most extensive learning among the philosophers of our times.\r\n\r\n11. The tract called Parapotamia, belonging to the Arab chiefs, and\r\nChalcidica, extending from the Massyas, border upon the district of\r\nApameia on the east; and nearly all the country further to the south of\r\nApameia belongs to the Scenitæ, who resemble the Nomades of Mesopotamia.\r\nIn proportion as the nations approach the Syrians they become more\r\ncivilized, while the Arabians and Scenitæ are less so. Their\r\ngovernments are better constituted [as that of Arethusa under\r\nSampsiceramus, that of Themella under Gambarus, and other states of this\r\nkind].[580]\r\n\r\n12. Such is the nature of the interior parts of the district of\r\nSeleuceia.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the navigation along the coast from Laodiceia is such\r\nas I shall now describe.\r\n\r\nNear Laodiceia are the small cities, Poseidium, Heracleium, and Gabala.\r\nThen follows the maritime tract[581] of the Aradii, where are\r\nPaltus,[582] Balanæa, and Carnus,[583] the arsenal of Aradus, which has\r\na small harbour; then Enydra,[584] and Marathus, an ancient city of the\r\nPhœnicians in ruins. The Aradii[585] divided the territory by lot. Then\r\nfollows the district Simyra.[586] Continuous with these places is\r\nOrthosia,[587] then the river Eleutherus, which some make the boundary\r\nof Seleucis towards Phœnicia and Cœle-Syria.\r\n\r\n13. Aradus is in front of a rocky coast without harbours, and situated\r\nnearly between its arsenal[588] and Marathus. It is distant from the\r\nland 20 stadia. It is a rock, surrounded by the sea, of about seven\r\nstadia in circuit, and covered with dwellings. The population even at\r\npresent is so large that the houses have many stories. It was colonized,\r\nit is said, by fugitives from Sidon. The inhabitants are supplied with\r\nwater partly from cisterns containing rain water, and partly [CAS. 754]\r\nfrom the opposite coast. In war time they obtain water a little in front\r\nof the city, from the channel (between the island and the mainland), in\r\nwhich there is an abundant spring. The water is obtained by letting down\r\nfrom a boat, which serves for the purpose, and inverting over the spring\r\n(at the bottom of the sea), a wide-mouthed funnel of lead, the end of\r\nwhich is contracted to a moderate-sized opening; round this is fastened\r\na (long) leathern pipe, which we may call the neck, and which receives\r\nthe water, forced up from the spring through the funnel. The water first\r\nforced up is sea water, but the boatmen wait for the flow of pure and\r\npotable water, which is received into vessels ready for the purpose, in\r\nas large a quantity as may be required, and carry it to the city.[589]\r\n\r\n14. The Aradii were anciently governed by their own kings in the same\r\nmanner as all the other Phœnician cities. Afterwards the Persians,\r\nMacedonians, and now the Romans have changed the government to its\r\npresent state.\r\n\r\nThe Aradii, together with the other Phœnicians, consented to become\r\nallies of the Syrian kings; but upon the dissension of the two brothers,\r\nCallinicus Seleucus and Antiochus Hierax, as he was called, they\r\nespoused the party of Callinicus; they entered into a treaty, by which\r\nthey were allowed to receive persons who quitted the king’s dominions,\r\nand took refuge among them, and were not obliged to deliver them up\r\nagainst their will. They were not, however, to suffer them to embark and\r\nquit the island without the king’s permission. From this they derived\r\ngreat advantages; for those who took refuge there were not ordinary\r\npeople, but persons who had held the highest trusts, and apprehended the\r\nworst consequences (when they fled). They regarded those who received\r\nthem with hospitality as their benefactors; they acknowledged their\r\npreservers, and remembered with gratitude the kindness which they had\r\nreceived, particularly after their return to their own country. It was\r\nthus that the Aradii acquired possession of a large part of the opposite\r\ncontinent, most of which they possess even at present, and were\r\notherwise successful. To this good fortune they added prudence and\r\nindustry in the conduct of their maritime affairs; when they saw their\r\nneighbours, the Cilicians, engaged in piratical adventures, they never\r\non any occasion took part with them in such (a disgraceful)\r\noccupation.[590]\r\n\r\n15. After Orthosia and the river Eleutherus is Tripolis, which has its\r\ndesignation from the fact of its consisting of three cities, Tyre,\r\nSidon, and Aradus. Contiguous to Tripolis is Theoprosopon,[591] where\r\nthe mountain Libanus terminates. Between them lies a small place called\r\nTrieres.\r\n\r\n16. There are two mountains, which form Cœle-Syria, as it is called,\r\nlying nearly parallel to each other; the commencement of the ascent of\r\nboth these mountains, Libanus and Antilibanus, is a little way from the\r\nsea; Libanus rises above the sea near Tripolis and Theoprosopon, and\r\nAntilibanus, above the sea near Sidon. They terminate somewhere near the\r\nArabian mountains, which are above the district of Damascus and the\r\nTrachones as they are there called, where they form fruitful hills. A\r\nhollow plain lies between them, the breadth of which towards the sea is\r\n200 stadia, and the length from the sea to the interior is about twice\r\nthat number of stadia. Rivers flow through it, the largest of which is\r\nthe Jordan, which water a country fertile and productive of all things.\r\nIt contains also a lake, which produces the aromatic rush and reed. In\r\nit are also marshes. The name of the lake is Gennesaritis. It produces\r\nalso balsamum.[592]\r\n\r\nAmong the rivers is the Chrysorrhoas, which commences [CAS. 755] from\r\nthe city and territory of Damascus, and is almost entirely drained by\r\nwater-courses; for it supplies with water a large tract of country, with\r\na very deep soil.\r\n\r\nThe Lycus[593] and the Jordan are navigated upwards chiefly by the\r\nAradii, with vessels of burden.\r\n\r\n17. Of the plains, the first reckoning from the sea is called Macras and\r\nMacra-pedium. Here Poseidonius says there was seen a serpent lying dead,\r\nwhich was nearly a plethrum in length, and of such a bulk and thickness\r\nthat men on horseback standing on each side of its body could not see\r\none another; the jaws when opened could take in a man on horseback, and\r\nthe scales of the skin were larger than a shield.\r\n\r\n18. Next to the plain of Macras is that of Massyas, which also contains\r\nsome mountainous parts, among which is Chalcis, the acropolis, as it\r\nwere, of the Massyas. The commencement of this plain is at\r\nLaodiceia,[594] near Libanus. The Ituræans and Arabians, all of whom are\r\nfreebooters, occupy the whole of the mountainous tracts. The husbandmen\r\nlive in the plains, and when harassed by the freebooters, they require\r\nprotection of various kinds. The robbers have strongholds from which\r\nthey issue forth; those, for example, who occupy Libanus have high up on\r\nthe mountain the fortresses Sinna, Borrhama, and some others like them;\r\nlower down, Botrys and Gigartus, caves also near the sea, and the castle\r\non the promontory Theoprosopon. Pompey destroyed these fastnesses, from\r\nwhence the robbers overran Byblus,[595] and Berytus[596] situated next\r\nto it, and which lie between Sidon and Theoprosopon.\r\n\r\nByblus, the royal seat of Cinyrus, is sacred to Adonis. Pompey delivered\r\nthis place from the tyranny of Cinyrus, by striking off his head. It is\r\nsituated upon an eminence at a little distance from the sea.\r\n\r\n19. After Byblus is the river Adonis,[597] and the mountain Climax, and\r\nPalæ-Byblus, then the river Lycus, and Berytus. This latter place was\r\nrazed by Tryphon, but now the Romans have restored it, and two legions\r\nwere stationed there by Agrippa, who also added to it a large portion of\r\nthe territory of Massyas, as far as the sources of the Orontes. These\r\nsources are near Libanus, the Paradeisus, and the Egyptian\r\nFort near the district of Apameia. These places lie near the sea.\r\n\r\n20. Above the Massyas is the Royal Valley, as it is called, and the\r\nterritory of Damascus, so highly extolled. Damascus is a considerable\r\ncity, and in the time of the Persian empire was nearly the most\r\ndistinguished place in that country.\r\n\r\nAbove Damascus are the two (hills) called Trachones; then, towards the\r\nparts occupied by Arabians and Ituræans promiscuously, are mountains of\r\ndifficult access, in which were caves extending to a great depth. One of\r\nthese caves was capable of containing four thousand robbers, when the\r\nterritory of Damascus was subject to incursions from various quarters.\r\nThe Barbarians used to rob the merchants most generally on the side of\r\nArabia Felix,[598] but this happens less frequently since the\r\ndestruction of the bands of the robbers under Zenodorus, by the good\r\ngovernment of the Romans, and in consequence of the security afforded by\r\nthe soldiers stationed and maintained in Syria.\r\n\r\n21. The whole country[599] above Seleucis, extending towards Egypt and\r\nArabia, is called Cœle-Syria, but peculiarly the tract bounded by\r\nLibanus and Antilibanus, of the remainder one part is the coast\r\nextending from Orthosia[600] as far as Pelusium,[601] and is called\r\nPhœnicia, a narrow strip of land along the sea; the other, situated\r\nabove Phœnicia in the interior between Gaza and Antilibanus, and\r\nextending to the Arabians, called Judæa.\r\n\r\n22. Having described Cœle-Syria properly so called, we pass on to\r\nPhœnicia, of which we have already described[602] the part extending\r\nfrom Orthosia to Berytus.\r\n\r\nNext to Berytus is Sidon, at the distance of 400 stadia. Between these\r\nplaces is the river Tamyras,[603] and the grove of Asclepius and\r\nLeontopolis.\r\n\r\nNext to Sidon is Tyre,[604] the largest and most ancient city of the\r\nPhœnicians. This city is the rival of Sidon in magnitude, fame, and\r\nantiquity, as recorded in many fables. For although poets have\r\ncelebrated Sidon more than Tyre (Homer, however, does not even mention\r\nTyre), yet the colonies sent into Africa and Spain, as far as, and\r\nbeyond the Pillars, extol [CAS. 756] much more the glory of Tyre. Both\r\nhowever were formerly, and are at present, distinguished and illustrious\r\ncities, but which of the two should be called the capital of Phœnicia is\r\na subject of dispute among the inhabitants.[605] Sidon is situated upon\r\na fine naturally-formed harbour on the mainland.\r\n\r\n23. Tyre is wholly an island, built nearly in the same manner as Aradus.\r\nIt is joined to the continent by a mound, which Alexander raised, when\r\nhe was besieging it. It has two harbours, one close, the other open,\r\nwhich is called the Egyptian harbour. The houses here, it is said,\r\nconsist of many stories, of more even than at Rome; on the occurrence,\r\ntherefore, of an earthquake, the city was nearly demolished.[606] It\r\nsustained great injury when it was taken by siege by Alexander, but it\r\nrose above these misfortunes, and recovered itself both by the skill of\r\nthe people in the art of navigation, in which the Phœnicians in general\r\nhave always excelled all nations, and by (the export of) purple-dyed\r\nmanufactures, the Tyrian purple being in the highest estimation. The\r\nshell-fish from which it is procured is caught near the coast, and the\r\nTyrians have in great abundance other requisites for dyeing. The great\r\nnumber of dyeing works renders the city unpleasant as a place of\r\nresidence, but the superior skill of the people in the practice of this\r\nart is the source of its wealth. Their independence was secured to them\r\nat a small expense to themselves, not only by the kings of Syria, but\r\nalso by the Romans, who confirmed what the former had conceded.[607]\r\nThey pay extravagant honours to Hercules.\r\n\r\nThe great number and magnitude of their colonies and cities are proofs\r\nof their maritime skill and power.\r\n\r\nSuch then are the Tyrians.\r\n\r\n24. The Sidonians are said by historians to excel in various kinds of\r\nart, as the words of Homer also imply.[608] Besides, they cultivate\r\nscience and study astronomy and arithmetic, to which they were led by\r\nthe application of numbers (in accounts) and night sailing, each of\r\nwhich (branches of knowledge) concerns the merchant and seaman; in the\r\nsame manner the Egyptians were led to the invention of geometry by the\r\nmensuration of ground, which was required in consequence of the Nile\r\nconfounding, by its overflow, the respective boundaries of the country.\r\nIt is thought that geometry was introduced into Greece from Egypt, and\r\nastronomy and arithmetic from Phœnicia. At present the best\r\nopportunities are afforded in these cities of acquiring a knowledge of\r\nthese, and of all other branches of philosophy.\r\n\r\nIf we are to believe Poseidonius, the ancient opinion about atoms\r\noriginated with Mochus, a native of Sidon, who lived before the Trojan\r\ntimes. Let us, however, dismiss subjects relating to antiquity. In my\r\ntime there were distinguished philosophers, natives of Sidon, as\r\nBoethus, with whom I studied the philosophy of Aristotle,[609] and\r\nDiodotus his brother. Antipater was of Tyre, and a little before my time\r\nApollonius, who published a table of the philosophers of the school of\r\nZeno, and of their writings.\r\n\r\nTyre is distant from Sidon not more than 200 stadia. Between the two is\r\nsituated a small town, called Ornithopolis, (the city of birds); next a\r\nriver[610] which empties itself near Tyre into the sea. Next after Tyre\r\nis Palæ-tyrus (ancient Tyre), at the distance of 30 stadia.[611]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 758] 25. Then follows Ptolemaïs, a large city, formerly called\r\nAce.[612] It was the place of rendezvous for the Persians in their\r\nexpeditions against Egypt. Between Ace and Tyre is a sandy beach, the\r\nsand of which is used in making glass. The sand, it is said, is not\r\nfused there, but carried to Sidon to undergo that process. Some say that\r\nthe Sidonians have, in their own country, the vitrifiable sand;\r\naccording to others, the sand of every place can be fused. I heard at\r\nAlexandria from the glass-workers, that there is in Egypt a kind of\r\nvitrifiable earth, without which expensive works in glass of various\r\ncolours could not be executed, but in other countries other mixtures are\r\nrequired; and at Rome, it is reported, there have been many inventions\r\nboth for producing various colours, and for facilitating the\r\nmanufacture, as for example in glass wares, where a glass bowl may be\r\npurchased for a copper coin,[613] and glass is ordinarily used for\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\n26. A phenomenon[614] of the rarest kind is said to have occurred on the\r\nshore between Tyre and Ptolemaïs. The people of Ptolemaïs had engaged in\r\nbattle with Sarpedon the general, and after a signal defeat were left in\r\nthis place, when a wave from the sea, like the rising tide, overwhelmed\r\nthe fugitives; some were carried out to sea and drowned, others perished\r\nin hollow places; then again the ebb succeeding, uncovered and displayed\r\nto sight the bodies lying in confusion among dead fish.\r\n\r\nA similar phenomenon took place at Mount Casium in Egypt. The ground, to\r\na considerable distance, after a violent and single shock fell in parts,\r\nat once exchanging places; the elevated parts opposed the access of the\r\nsea, and parts which had subsided admitted it. Another shock occurred,\r\nand the place recovered its ancient position, except that there was an\r\nalteration (in the surface of the ground) in some places, and none in\r\nothers. Perhaps such occurrences are connected with periodical returns\r\nthe nature of which is unknown to us. This is said to be the case with\r\nthe rise of the waters of the Nile, which exhibits a variety in its\r\neffects, but observes (in general) a certain order, which we do not\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\n27. Next to Ace is the Tower of Strato, with a station for\r\nvessels.[615] Between these places is Mount Carmel, and cities of which\r\nnothing but the names remain, as Sycaminopolis, Bucolopolis,\r\nCrocodeilopolis, and others of this kind; next is a large forest.[616]\r\n\r\n28. Then Joppa,[617] where the coast of Egypt, which at first stretches\r\ntowards the east, makes a remarkable bend towards the north. In this\r\nplace, according to some writers, Andromeda was exposed to the\r\nsea-monster. It is sufficiently elevated; it is said to command a view\r\nof Jerusalem, the capital of the Jews,[618] who, when they descended to\r\nthe sea, used this place as a naval arsenal. But the arsenals of robbers\r\nare the haunts of robbers. Carmel, and the forest, belonged to the Jews.\r\nThe district was so populous that the neighbouring village Iamneia,[619]\r\nand the settlements around, could furnish forty thousand soldiers.\r\n\r\nThence to Casium,[620] near Pelusium, are little more than 1000 stadia,\r\nand 1300 to Pelusium itself.\r\n\r\n29. In the interval is Gadaris,[621] which the Jews have appropriated to\r\nthemselves, then Azotus and Ascalon.[622] From Iamneia to Azotus and\r\nAscalon are about 200 stadia. The country of the Ascalonitæ produces\r\nexcellent onions; the town is small. Antiochus the philosopher, who\r\nlived a little before our time, was a native of this place. Philodemus\r\nthe Epicurean was a native of Gadara, as also Meleagrus, Menippus the\r\nsatirist, and Theodorus the rhetorician, my contemporary.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 759] 30. Next and near Ascalon is the harbour of the Gazæi. The\r\ncity is situated inland at the distance of seven stadia. It was once\r\nfamous, but was razed by Alexander, and remains uninhabited. There is\r\nsaid to be a passage thence across, of 1260 stadia, to the city\r\nAila[623] (Aelana), situated on the innermost recess of the Arabian\r\nGulf. This recess has two branches, one, in the direction of Arabia and\r\nGaza, is called Ailanites, from the city upon it; the other is in the\r\ndirection of Egypt, towards Heroopolis,[624] to which from Pelusium is\r\nthe shortest road (between the two seas). Travelling is performed on\r\ncamels, through a desert and sandy country, in the course of which\r\nsnakes are found in great numbers.\r\n\r\n31. Next to Gaza is Raphia,[625] where a battle was fought between\r\nPtolemy the Fourth and Antiochus the Great.[626] Then Rhinocolura,[627]\r\nso called from the colonists, whose noses had been mutilated. Some\r\nEthiopian invaded Egypt, and, instead of putting the malefactors to\r\ndeath, cut off their noses, and settled them at Rhinocolura, supposing\r\nthat they would not venture to return to their own country, on account\r\nof the disgraceful condition of their faces.\r\n\r\n32. The whole country from Gaza is barren and sandy, and still more so\r\nis that district next to it, which contains the lake Sirbonis,[628]\r\nlying above it in a direction almost parallel to the sea, and leaving a\r\nnarrow pass between, as far as what is called the Ecregma.[629] The\r\nlength of the pass is about 200, and the greatest breadth 50 stadia. The\r\nEcregma is filled up with earth. Then follows another continuous tract\r\nof the same kind to Casium,[630] and thence to Pelusium.\r\n\r\n33. The Casium is a sandy hill without water, and forms a promontory:\r\nthe body of Pompey the Great is buried there, and on it is a temple of\r\nJupiter Casius.[631] Near this place Pompey the Great was betrayed by\r\nthe Egyptians, and put to death. Next is the road to Pelusium, on which\r\nis situated Gerrha;[632] and the rampart, as it is called, of Chabrias,\r\nand the pits near Pelusium, formed by the overflowing of the Nile in\r\nplaces naturally hollow and marshy.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of Phœnicia. Artemidorus says, that from Orthosia to\r\nPelusium is 3650 stadia, including the winding of the bays, and from\r\nMelænæ or Melania in Cilicia to Celenderis,[633] on the confines of\r\nCilicia and Syria, are 1900 stadia; thence to the Orontes 520 stadia,\r\nand from Orontes to Orthosia 1130 stadia.\r\n\r\n34. The western extremities of Judæa towards Casius are occupied by\r\nIdumæans, and by the lake [Sirbonis]. The Idumæans are Nabatæans. When\r\ndriven from their country[634] by sedition, they passed over to the\r\nJews, and adopted their customs.[635] The greater part of the country\r\nalong the coast to Jerusalem is occupied by the Lake Sirbonis, and by\r\nthe tract contiguous to it; for Jerusalem is near the sea, which, as we\r\nhave said,[636] may be seen from the arsenal of Joppa.[637] These\r\ndistricts (of Jerusalem and Joppa) lie towards the north; they are\r\ninhabited generally, and each place in particular, by mixed tribes of\r\nEgyptians, Arabians, and Phœnicians. Of this description are the\r\ninhabitants of Galilee, of the plain of Jericho, and of the territories\r\nof Philadelphia and Samaria,[638] surnamed Sebaste by Herod;[639] but\r\nalthough there is such a mixture of inhabitants, the report most\r\ncredited, [one] among many things believed respecting the temple [and\r\nthe inhabitants] of Jerusalem, is, that the Egyptians were the ancestors\r\nof the present Jews.[640]\r\n\r\n35. An Egyptian priest named Moses, who possessed a portion of the\r\ncountry called the Lower [Egypt] * * * *, being dissatisfied with the\r\nestablished institutions there, left it and came to Judæa with a large\r\nbody of people who worshipped the Divinity. He declared and taught that\r\nthe Egyptians and Africans entertained erroneous sentiments, [CAS. 761]\r\nin representing the Divinity under the likeness of wild beasts and\r\ncattle of the field; that the Greeks also were in error in making images\r\nof their gods after the human form. For God [said he] may be this one\r\nthing which encompasses us all, land and sea, which we call heaven, or\r\nthe universe, or the nature of things.[641] Who then of any\r\nunderstanding would venture to form an image of this Deity, resembling\r\nanything with which we are conversant? on the contrary, we ought not to\r\ncarve any images, but to set apart some sacred ground and a shrine\r\nworthy of the Deity, and to worship Him without any similitude.[642] He\r\ntaught that those who made fortunate dreams were to be permitted to\r\nsleep in the temple, where they might dream both for themselves and\r\nothers; that those who practised temperance and justice, and none else,\r\nmight expect good, or some gift or sign from the God, from time to time.\r\n\r\n36. By such doctrine Moses[643] persuaded a large body of right-minded\r\npersons to accompany him to the place where Jerusalem now stands. He\r\neasily obtained possession of it, as the spot was not such as to excite\r\njealousy, nor for which there could be any fierce contention; for it is\r\nrocky, and, although well supplied with water, it is surrounded by a\r\nbarren and waterless territory.[644] The space within [the city] is 60\r\nstadia [in circumference], with rock underneath the surface.\r\n\r\nInstead of arms, he taught that their defence was in their sacred things\r\nand the Divinity, for whom he was desirous of finding a settled place,\r\npromising to the people to deliver such a kind of worship and religion\r\nas should not burthen those who adopted it with great expense, nor\r\nmolest them with [so-called] divine possessions, nor other absurd\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nMoses thus obtained their good opinion, and established no ordinary kind\r\nof government. All the nations around willingly united themselves to\r\nhim, allured by his discourses and promises.\r\n\r\n37. His successors continued for some time to observe the same conduct,\r\ndoing justly, and worshipping God with sincerity. Afterwards\r\nsuperstitious persons were appointed to the priesthood, and then\r\ntyrants. From superstition arose abstinence from flesh, from the eating\r\nof which it is now the custom to refrain, circumcision, excision,[645]\r\nand other practices which the people observe. The tyrannical government\r\nproduced robbery; for the rebels plundered both their own and the\r\nneighbouring countries. Those also who shared in the government seized\r\nupon the property of others, and ravaged a large part of Syria and of\r\nPhœnicia.\r\n\r\nRespect, however, was paid to the Acropolis; it was not abhorred as the\r\nseat of tyranny, but honoured and venerated as a temple.\r\n\r\n38. This is according to nature, and common both to Greeks and\r\nbarbarians. For, as members of a civil community, they live according to\r\na common law; otherwise it would be impossible for the mass to execute\r\nany one thing in concert (in which consists a civil state), or to live\r\nin a social state at all. Law is two-fold, divine and human. The ancients\r\nregarded and respected divine, in preference to human, law; in those\r\ntimes, therefore, the number of persons was very great who consulted\r\noracles, and, being desirous of obtaining the advice of Jupiter, hurried\r\nto Dodona,\r\n\r\n   “to hear the answer of Jove from the lofty oak.”\r\n\r\nThe parent went to Delphi,\r\n\r\n   “anxious to learn whether the child which had been exposed (to\r\n   die) was still living;”\r\n\r\nwhile the child itself\r\n\r\n   “was gone to the temple of Apollo, with the hope of\r\n   discovering its parents.”\r\n\r\nAnd Minos among the Cretans,\r\n\r\n   “the king who in the ninth year enjoyed converse with Great\r\n   Jupiter,”\r\n\r\nevery nine years, as Plato says, ascended to the cave of Jupiter,\r\nreceived ordinances from him, and conveyed them to men. Lycurgus, his\r\nimitator, acted in a similar manner; for he was often accustomed, as it\r\nseemed, to leave his own country to inquire of the Pythian goddess what\r\nordinances he was to promulgate to the Lacedæmonians.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 762] 39. What truth there may be in these things I cannot say;\r\nthey have at least been regarded and believed as true by mankind. Hence\r\nprophets received so much honour as to be thought worthy even of\r\nthrones, because they were supposed to communicate ordinances and\r\nprecepts from the gods, both during their lifetime and after their\r\ndeath; as for example Teiresias,\r\n\r\n   “to whom alone Proserpine gave wisdom and understanding after\r\n   death: the others flit about as shadows.”[646]\r\n\r\nSuch were Amphiaraus, Trophonius, Orpheus, and Musæus: in former times\r\nthere was Zamolxis, a Pythagorean, who was accounted a god among the\r\nGetæ; and in our time, Decæneus, the diviner of Byrebistas. Among the\r\nBosporani, there was Achaïcarus; among the Indians, were the\r\nGymnosophists; among the Persians, the Magi and Necyomanteis,[647] and\r\nbesides these the Lecanomanteis[648] and Hydromanteis;[649] among the\r\nAssyrians, were the Chaldæans; and among the Romans, the Tyrrhenian\r\ndiviners of dreams.[650]\r\n\r\nSuch was Moses and his successors; their beginning was good, but they\r\ndegenerated.\r\n\r\n40. When Judæa openly became subject to a tyrannical government, the\r\nfirst person who exchanged the title of priest for that of king was\r\nAlexander.[651] His sons were Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. While they were\r\ndisputing the succession to the kingdom, Pompey came upon them by\r\nsurprise, deprived them of their power, and destroyed their fortresses,\r\nfirst taking Jerusalem itself by storm.[652] It was a stronghold,\r\nsituated on a rock, well fortified and well supplied with water[653]\r\nwithin, but externally entirely parched with drought. A ditch was cut\r\nin the rock, 60 feet in depth, and in width 250 feet. On the wall of the\r\ntemple were built towers, constructed of the materials procured when the\r\nditch was excavated. The city was taken, it is said, by waiting for the\r\nday of fast, on which the Jews were in the habit of abstaining from all\r\nwork. Pompey [availing himself of this], filled up the ditch, and threw\r\nbridges over it. He gave orders to raze all the walls, and he destroyed,\r\nas far as was in his power, the haunts of the robbers and the\r\ntreasure-holds of the tyrants. Two of these forts, Thrax and Taurus,\r\nwere situated in the passes leading to Jericho. Others were Alexandrium,\r\nHyrcanium, Machærus, Lysias, and those about Philadelphia, and\r\nScythopolis near Galilee.\r\n\r\n41. Jericho is a plain encompassed by a mountainous district, which\r\nslopes towards it somewhat in the manner of a theatre. Here is the\r\nPhœnicon (or palm plantation), which contains various other trees of the\r\ncultivated kind, and producing excellent fruit; but its chief production\r\nis the palm tree. It is 100 stadia in length; the whole is watered with\r\nstreams, and filled with dwellings. Here also is a palace and the garden\r\nof the balsamum.[654] The latter is a shrub with an aromatic smell,\r\nresembling the cytisus[655] and the terminthus.[656] Incisions are made\r\nin the bark, and vessels are placed beneath to receive the sap, which is\r\nlike oily milk. After it is collected in vessels, it becomes solid. It\r\nis an excellent remedy for headache, incipient suffusion of the eyes,\r\nand dimness of sight. It bears therefore a high price, especially as it\r\nis produced in no other place.[657] This is the case also with the\r\nPhœnicon, which alone contains the caryotes[658] palm, if we except the\r\nBabylonian plain, and the country above it towards the east: a large\r\nrevenue is derived from the palms and balsamum; xylobalsamum[659] is\r\nalso used as a perfume.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 764] 42. The Lake Sirbonis[660] is of great extent. Some say that\r\nit is 1000 stadia in circumference. It stretches along the coast, to the\r\ndistance of a little more than 200 stadia. It is deep, and the water is\r\nexceedingly heavy, so that no person can dive into it; if any one wades\r\ninto it up to the waist, and attempts to move forward, he is immediately\r\nlifted out of the water.[661] It abounds with asphaltus, which rises,\r\nnot however at any regular seasons, in bubbles, like boiling water, from\r\nthe middle of the deepest part. The surface is convex, and presents the\r\nappearance of a hillock. Together with the asphaltus, there ascends a\r\ngreat quantity of sooty vapour, not perceptible to the eye, which\r\ntarnishes copper, silver, and everything bright—even gold. The\r\nneighbouring people know by the tarnishing of their vessels that the\r\nasphaltus is beginning to rise, and they prepare to collect it by means\r\nof rafts composed of reeds. The asphaltus is a clod of earth, liquefied\r\nby heat; the air forces it to the surface, where it spreads itself. It\r\nis again changed into so firm and solid a mass by cold water, such as\r\nthe water of the lake, that it requires cutting or chopping (for use).\r\nIt floats upon the water, which, as I have described, does not admit of\r\ndiving or immersion, but lifts up the person who goes into it. Those who\r\ngo on rafts for the asphaltus cut it in pieces, and take away as much as\r\nthey are able to carry.\r\n\r\n43. Such are the phenomena. But Posidonius says, that the people being\r\naddicted to magic, and practising incantations, (by these means)\r\nconsolidate the asphaltus, pouring upon it urine and other fetid fluids,\r\nand then cut it into pieces. (Incantations cannot be the cause), but\r\nperhaps urine may have some peculiar power (in effecting the\r\nconsolidation) in the same manner that chrysocolla[662] is formed in\r\nthe bladders of persons who labour under the disease of the stone, and\r\nin the urine of children.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for these phenomena to take place in the middle of the\r\nlake, because the source of the fire is in the centre, and the greater\r\npart of the asphaltus comes from thence. The bubbling up, however, of\r\nthe asphaltus is irregular, because the motion of fire, like that of\r\nmany other vapours, has no order perceptible to observers. There are\r\nalso phenomena of this kind at Apollonia in Epirus.\r\n\r\n44. Many other proofs are produced to show that this country is full of\r\nfire. Near Moasada[663] are to be seen rugged rocks, bearing the marks\r\nof fire; fissures in many places; a soil like ashes; pitch falling in\r\ndrops from the rocks; rivers boiling up, and emitting a fetid odour to a\r\ngreat distance; dwellings in every direction overthrown; whence we are\r\ninclined to believe the common tradition of the natives, that thirteen\r\ncities[664] once existed there, the capital of which was Sodom, but that\r\na circuit of about 60 stadia around it escaped uninjured; shocks of\r\nearthquakes, however, eruptions of flames and hot springs, containing\r\nasphaltus and sulphur, caused the lake to burst its bounds, and the\r\nrocks took fire; some of the cities were swallowed up, others were\r\nabandoned by such of the inhabitants as were able to make their escape.\r\n\r\nBut Eratosthenes asserts, on the contrary, that the country was once a\r\nlake, and that the greater part of it was uncovered by the water\r\ndischarging itself through a breach, as was the case in Thessaly.[665]\r\n\r\n45. In the Gadaris, also, there is a lake of noxious water. If beasts\r\ndrink it, they lose their hair, hoofs, and horns. At the place called\r\nTaricheæ,[666] the lake supplies the best fish for curing. [CAS. 765]\r\nOn its banks grow trees which bear a fruit like the apple. The Egyptians\r\nuse the asphaltus for embalming the bodies of the dead.\r\n\r\n46. Pompey curtailed the territory which had been forcibly appropriated\r\nby the Jews, and assigned to Hyrcanus the priesthood. Some time\r\nafterwards, Herod, of the same family, and a native of the country,[667]\r\nhaving surreptitiously obtained the priesthood, distinguished himself so\r\nmuch above his predecessors, particularly in his intercourse, both civil\r\nand political, with the Romans, that he received the title and authority\r\nof king,[668] first from Antony, and afterwards from Augustus Cæsar. He\r\nput to death some of his sons, on the pretext of their having conspired\r\nagainst him;[669] other sons he left at his death, to succeed him, and\r\nassigned to each, portions of his kingdom. Cæsar bestowed upon the sons\r\nalso of Herod marks of honour,[670] on his sister Salome,[671] and on\r\nher daughter Berenice. The sons were unfortunate, and were publicly\r\naccused. One[672] of them died in exile among the Galatæ Allobroges,\r\nwhose country was assigned for his abode. The others, by great interest\r\nand solicitation, but with difficulty, obtained leave to return[673] to\r\ntheir own country, each with his tetrarchy restored to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Above Judæa and Cœle-Syria, as far as Babylonia and the river tract,\r\nalong the banks of the Euphrates towards the south, lies the whole of\r\nArabia, except the Scenitæ in Mesopotamia. We have already spoken of\r\nMesopotamia, and of the nations that inhabit it.[674]\r\n\r\nThe parts on the other (the eastern) side of the Euphrates, towards its\r\nmouth, are occupied by Babylonians and the nation of the Chaldæans. We\r\nhave spoken of these people also.[675]\r\n\r\nOf the rest of the country which follows after Mesopotamia, and extends\r\nas far as Cœle-Syria, the part approaching the river, as well as [a part\r\nof] Mesopotamia,[676] are occupied by Arabian Scenitæ, who are divided\r\ninto small sovereignties, and inhabit tracts which are barren from want\r\nof water. They do not till the land at all, or only to a small extent,\r\nbut they keep herds of cattle of all kinds, particularly of camels.\r\nAbove these is a great desert; but the parts lying still more to the\r\nsouth are occupied by the nations inhabiting Arabia Felix, as it is\r\ncalled. The northern side of this tract is formed by the above-mentioned\r\ndesert, the eastern by the Persian, the western by the Arabian Gulf, and\r\nthe southern by [CAS. 766] the great sea lying outside of both the\r\ngulfs, the whole of which is called the Erythræan Sea.[677]\r\n\r\n2. The Persian Gulf has the name also of the Sea of Persia. Eratosthenes\r\nspeaks of it in this manner: “They say that the mouth is so narrow, that\r\nfrom Harmozi,[678] the promontory of Carmania, may be seen the\r\npromontory at Macæ, in Arabia. From the mouth, the coast on the right\r\nhand is circular, and at first inclines a little from Carmania towards\r\nthe east, then to the north, and afterwards to the west as far as\r\nTeredon and the mouth of the Euphrates.[679] In an extent of about\r\n10,000 stadia, it comprises the coast of the Carmanians, Persians, and\r\nSusians, and in part of the Babylonians. (Of these we ourselves have\r\nbefore spoken.) Hence directly as far as the mouth are 10,000 stadia\r\nmore, according, it is said, to the computation of Androsthenes of\r\nThasos, who not only had accompanied Nearchus, but had also alone sailed\r\nalong the sea-coast of Arabia.[680] It is hence evident that this sea is\r\nlittle inferior in size to the Euxine.\r\n\r\n“He says that Androsthenes, who had navigated the gulf with a fleet,\r\nrelates, that in sailing from Teredon with the continent on the right\r\nhand, an island Icaros[681] is met with, lying in front, which contained\r\na temple sacred to Apollo, and an oracle of [Diana] Tauropolus.\r\n\r\n3. “Having coasted the shore of Arabia to the distance of 2400 stadia,\r\nthere lies, in a deep gulf, a city of the name of Gerrha,[682] belonging\r\nto Chaldæan exiles from Babylon, who inhabit the district in which salt\r\nis found, and who have houses constructed of salt: as scales of salt\r\nseparated by the burning heat of the sun are continually falling off,\r\nthe houses are sprinkled with water, and the walls are thus kept firm\r\ntogether. The city is distant 200 stadia from the sea. The merchants of\r\nGerrha generally carry the Arabian merchandise and aromatics by land;\r\nbut Aristobulus says, on the contrary, that they frequently travel into\r\nBabylonia on rafts, and thence sail up the Euphrates to Thapsacus[683]\r\nwith their cargoes, but afterwards carry them by land to all parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n4. “On sailing further, there are other islands, Tyre[684] and\r\nAradus,[685] which have temples resembling those of the Phœnicians. The\r\ninhabitants of these islands (if we are to believe them) say that the\r\nislands and cities bearing the same name as those of the Phœnicians are\r\ntheir own colonies.[686] These islands are distant from Teredon ten\r\ndays’ sail, and from the promontory at the mouth of the gulf at Macæ one\r\nday’s sail.\r\n\r\n5. “Nearchus and Orthagoras relate, that an island Ogyris lies to the\r\nsouth, in the open sea, at the distance of 2000 stadia[687] from\r\nCarmania. In this island is shown the sepulchre of Erythras, a large\r\nmound, planted with wild palms. He [CAS. 767] was king of the country,\r\nand the sea received its name from him. It is said that Mithropastes,\r\nthe son of Arsites, satrap of Phrygia, pointed out these things to them.\r\nMithropastes was banished by Darius, and resided in this island; he\r\njoined himself to those who had come down to the Persian Gulf, and hoped\r\nthrough their means to have an opportunity of returning to his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n6. “Along the whole coast of the Red Sea, in the deep part of the water\r\ngrow trees resembling the laurel and the olive. When the tide ebbs, the\r\nwhole trees are visible above the water, and at the full tide they are\r\nsometimes entirely covered. This is the more singular because the coast\r\ninland has no trees.”\r\n\r\nThis is the description given by Eratosthenes of the Persian Sea, which\r\nforms, as we have said, the eastern side of Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n7. Nearchus says, that they were met by Mithropastes, in company with\r\nMazenes, who was governor of one of the islands, called Doracta\r\n(Oaracta?)[688] in the Persian Gulf; that Mithropastes, after his\r\nretreat from Ogyris, took refuge there, and was hospitably received;\r\nthat he had an interview with Mazenes, for the purpose of being\r\nrecommended to the Macedonians, in the fleet of which Mazenes was the\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nNearchus also mentions an island, met with at the recommencement of the\r\nvoyage along the coast of Persia, where are found pearls in large\r\nquantities and of great value; in other islands there are transparent\r\nand brilliant pebbles; in the islands in front of the Euphrates there\r\nare trees which send forth the odour of frankincense, and from their\r\nroots, when bruised, a (perfumed) juice flows out; the crabs and sea\r\nhedgehogs are of vast size, which is common in all the exterior seas,\r\nsome being larger than Macedonian hats;[689] others of the capacity of\r\ntwo cotyli; he says also that he had seen driven on shore a whale fifty\r\ncubits in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Arabia commences on the side of Babylonia with Mæcene.[690] In front\r\nof this district, on one side lies the desert of the Arabians, on the\r\nother are the marshes[691] opposite to the Chaldæans, formed by the\r\noverflowing of the Euphrates, and in another direction is the Sea of\r\nPersia. This country has an unhealthy and cloudy atmosphere; it is\r\nsubject to showers, and also to scorching heat; still its products are\r\nexcellent. The vine grows in the marshes; as much earth as the plant may\r\nrequire is laid upon hurdles of reeds;[692] the hurdle is frequently\r\ncarried away by the water, and is then forced back again by poles to its\r\nproper situation.\r\n\r\n2. I return to the opinions of Eratosthenes, which he next delivers\r\nrespecting Arabia. He is speaking of the northern and desert part, lying\r\nbetween Arabia Felix, Cœle-Syria, and Judæa, to the recess of the\r\nArabian Gulf.\r\n\r\nFrom Heroopolis, situated in that recess of the Arabian Gulf which is on\r\nthe side of the Nile, to Babylon, towards Petra of the Nabatæi, are 5600\r\nstadia. The whole tract lies in the direction of the summer solstice\r\n(i. e. east and west), and passes through the adjacent Arabian tribes,\r\nnamely Nabatæi, Chaulotæi, and Agræi. Above these people is Arabia\r\nFelix, stretching out 12,000 stadia towards the south to the Atlantic\r\nSea.[693]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 768] The first people, next after the Syrians and Jews, who\r\noccupy this country are husbandmen. These people are succeeded by a\r\nbarren and sandy tract, producing a few palms, the acanthus,[694] and\r\ntamarisk; water is obtained by digging [wells] as in Gedrosia. It is\r\ninhabited by Arabian Scenitæ, who breed camels. The extreme parts\r\ntowards the south, and opposite to Ethiopia, are watered by summer\r\nshowers, and are sowed twice, like the land in India. Its rivers are\r\nexhausted in watering plains, and by running into lakes. The general\r\nfertility of the country is very great; among other products, there is\r\nin particular an abundant supply of honey; except horses,[695] there are\r\nnumerous herds of animals, mules (asses?), and swine; birds also of\r\nevery kind, except geese and the gallinaceous tribe.\r\n\r\nFour of the most populous nations inhabit the extremity of the\r\nabove-mentioned country; namely, the Minæi the part towards the Red Sea,\r\nwhose largest city is Carna or Carnana.[696] Next to these are the\r\nSabæans, whose chief city is Mariaba.[697] The third nation are the\r\nCattabaneis,[698] extending to the straits and the passage across the\r\nArabian Gulf. Their royal seat is called Tamna. The Chatramotitæ[699]\r\nare the furthest of these nations towards the east. Their city is\r\nSabata.\r\n\r\n3. All these cities are governed by one monarch, and are flourishing.\r\nThey are adorned with beautiful temples and palaces. Their houses, in\r\nthe mode of binding the timbers together, are like those in Egypt. The\r\nfour countries comprise a greater territory than the Delta of\r\nEgypt.[700]\r\n\r\nThe son does not succeed the father in the throne, but the son who is\r\nborn in a family of the nobles first after the accession of the king. As\r\nsoon as any one is invested with the government, the pregnant wives of\r\nthe nobles are registered, and guardians are appointed to watch which of\r\nthem is first delivered of a son. The custom is to adopt and educate the\r\nchild in a princely manner as the future successor to the throne.\r\n\r\n4. Cattabania produces frankincense, and Chatramotitis myrrh; these and\r\nother aromatics are the medium of exchange with the merchants. Merchants\r\narrive in seventy days at Minæa from Ælana.[701] Ælana is a city on the\r\nother recess of the Arabian Gulf, which is called Ælanites, opposite to\r\nGaza, as we have before described it.[702] The Gerrhæi arrive in\r\nChatramotitis in forty days.\r\n\r\nThe part of the Arabian Gulf along the side of Arabia, if we reckon from\r\nthe recess of the Ælanitic bay, is, according to the accounts of\r\nAlexander and Anaxicrates, 14,000 stadia in extent; but this computation\r\nis too great. The part opposite to Troglodytica, which is on the right\r\nhand of those who are sailing from Heroopolis[703] to Ptolemaïs, to the\r\ncountry where elephants are taken, extends 9000 stadia to the south, and\r\ninclines a little towards the east. Thence to the straits are about 4500\r\nstadia, in a direction more towards the east. The straits at Ethiopia\r\nare formed by a promontory called Deire.[704] There is a small town upon\r\nit of the same name. The Ichthyophagi inhabit this country. Here it is\r\nsaid is a pillar of Sesostris the Egyptian, on which is inscribed, in\r\nhieroglyphics, an account of his passage (across the Arabian Gulf). For\r\nhe appears to have subdued first Ethiopia and Troglodytica,[705] and\r\nafterwards to have passed over into Arabia. He then overran the whole of\r\nAsia. Hence in many places there are dykes called the dykes of\r\nSesostris, and temples built in honour of Egyptian deities.\r\n\r\nThe straits at Deire are contracted to the width of 60 stadia; not\r\nindeed that these are now called the Straits, for ships proceed to a\r\nfurther distance, and find a passage of about 200 [CAS. 769] stadia\r\nbetween the two continents;[706] six islands contiguous to one another\r\nleave a very narrow passage through them for vessels, by filling up the\r\ninterval between the continents. Through these goods are transported\r\nfrom one continent to the other on rafts; it is this passage which is\r\ncalled the Straits. After these islands, the subsequent navigation is\r\namong bays along the Myrrh country, in the direction of south and east,\r\nas far as the Cinnamon country, a distance of about 5000 stadia;[707]\r\nbeyond this district no one to this time, it is said, has penetrated.\r\nThere are not many cities upon the coast, but in the interior they are\r\nnumerous and well inhabited. Such is the account of Arabia given by\r\nEratosthenes. We must add what is related also by other writers.\r\n\r\n5. Artemidorus[708] says, that the promontory of Arabia, opposite to\r\nDeire, is called Acila,[709] and that the persons who live near Deire\r\ndeprive themselves of the prepuce.\r\n\r\nIn sailing from Heroopolis along Troglodytica, a city is met with called\r\nPhilotera,[710] after the sister of the second Ptolemy; it was founded\r\nby Satyrus, who was sent to explore the hunting-ground for the\r\nelephants, and Troglodytica itself. Next to this is another city,\r\nArsinoë; and next to this, springs of hot water, which are salt and\r\nbitter; they are precipitated from a high rock, and discharge themselves\r\ninto the sea. There is in a plain near (these springs) a mountain, which\r\nis of a red colour like minium. Next is Myus Hormus, which is also\r\ncalled Aphrodites Hormus;[711] it is a large harbour with an oblique\r\nentrance. In front are three islands; two are covered with olive trees,\r\nand one (the third) is less shaded with trees, and abounds with\r\nguinea-fowls.[712] Then follows Acathartus (or Foul Bay), which, like\r\nMyus Hormus, is in the latitude of the Thebaïs. The bay is really foul,\r\nfor it is very dangerous from rocks (some of which are covered by the\r\nsea, others rise to the surface), as also from almost constant and\r\nfurious tempests. At the bottom of the bay is situated the city\r\nBerenice.[713]\r\n\r\n6. After the bay is the island Ophiodes,[714] so called from the\r\naccidental circumstance [of its having once been infested with\r\nserpents]. It was cleared of the serpents by the king,[715] on account\r\nof the destruction occasioned by those noxious animals to the persons\r\nwho frequented the island, and on account of the topazes found there.\r\nThe topaz is a transparent stone, sparkling with a golden lustre, which\r\nhowever is not easy to be distinguished in the day-time, on account of\r\nthe brightness of the surrounding light, but at night the stones are\r\nvisible to those who collect them. The collectors place a vessel over\r\nthe spot [where the topazes are seen] as a mark, and dig them up in the\r\nday. A body of men was appointed and maintained by the kings of Egypt to\r\nguard the place [CAS. 770] where these stones were found, and to\r\nsuperintend the collection of them.\r\n\r\n7. Next after this island follow many tribes of Ichthyophagi and of\r\nNomades; then succeeds the harbour of the goddess Soteira (the\r\nPreserver), which had its name from the circumstance of the escape and\r\npreservation of some masters [of vessels] from great dangers by sea.\r\n\r\nAfter this the coast and the gulf seem to undergo a great change: for\r\nthe voyage along the coast is no longer among rocks, and approaches\r\nalmost close to Arabia; the sea is so shallow as to be scarcely of the\r\ndepth of two orguiæ,[716] and has the appearance of a meadow, in\r\nconsequence of the sea-weeds, which abound in the passage, being visible\r\nthrough and under the water. Even trees here grow from under the water,\r\nand the sea abounds with sea-dogs.\r\n\r\nNext are two mountains,[717] the Tauri (or the Bulls), presenting at a\r\ndistance a resemblance to these animals. Then follows another mountain,\r\non which is a temple of Isis, built by Sesostris; then an island planted\r\nwith olive trees, and at times overflowed. This is followed by the city\r\nPtolemaïs, near the hunting-grounds of the elephants,[718] founded by\r\nEumedes, who was sent by Philadelphus to the hunting-ground. He\r\nenclosed, without the knowledge of the inhabitants, a kind of peninsula\r\nwith a ditch and wall, and by his courteous address gained over those\r\nwho were inclined to obstruct the work, and instead of enemies made them\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\n8. In the intervening space, a branch of the river Astaboras[719]\r\ndischarges itself. It has its source in a lake, and empties part of its\r\nwaters [into the bay], but the larger portion it contributes to the\r\nNile. Then follow six islands, called Latomiæ,[720] after these the\r\nSabaïtic mouth,[721] as it is called, and in the inland parts a\r\nfortress built by Suchus.[722] Then a lake called Elæa, and the island\r\nof Strato;[723] next Saba[724] a port, and a hunting-ground for\r\nelephants of the same name. The country deep in the interior is called\r\nTenessis. It is occupied by those Egyptians who took refuge from the\r\ngovernment of Psammitichus.[725] They are surnamed Sembritæ,[726] as\r\nbeing strangers. They are governed by a queen, to whom also Meroë, an\r\nisland in the Nile near these places, is subject. Above this, at no\r\ngreat distance, is another island in the river, a settlement occupied by\r\nthe same fugitives. From Meroë to this sea is a journey of fifteen days\r\nfor an active person.\r\n\r\nNear Meroë is the confluence of the Astaboras,[727] the Astapus,[728]\r\nand of the Astasobas with the Nile.\r\n\r\n9. On the banks of these rivers live the Rhizophagi (or root-eaters) and\r\nHeleii (or marsh-men). They have their name from digging roots in the\r\nadjacent marsh, bruising them with stones, and forming them into cakes,\r\nwhich they dry in the sun for food. These countries are the haunts of\r\nlions. The wild beasts are driven out of these places, at the time of\r\nthe rising of the dog-star, by large gnats.\r\n\r\nNear these people live the Spermophagi (or seed-eaters), who, when seeds\r\nof plants fail, subsist upon seeds of trees,[729] [CAS. 771] which they\r\nprepare in the same manner as the Rhizophagi prepare their roots.\r\n\r\nNext to Elæa are the watch-towers of Demetrius, and the altars of Conon.\r\nIn the interior Indian reeds grow in abundance. The country there is\r\ncalled the country of Coracius.\r\n\r\nFar in the interior was a place called Endera, inhabited by a naked\r\ntribe,[730] who use bows and reed arrows, the points of which are\r\nhardened in the fire. They generally shoot the animals from trees,\r\nsometimes from the ground. They have numerous herds of wild cattle among\r\nthem, on the flesh of which they subsist, and on that of other wild\r\nanimals. When they have taken nothing in the chase, they dress dried\r\nskins upon hot coals, and are satisfied with food of this kind. It is\r\ntheir custom to propose trials of skill in archery for those who have\r\nnot attained manhood.\r\n\r\nNext to the altars of Conon is the port of Melinus, and above it is a\r\nfortress called that of Coraus and the chase of Coraus, also another\r\nfortress and more hunting-grounds. Then follows the harbour of\r\nAntiphilus, and above this a tribe, the Creophagi, deprived of the\r\nprepuce, and the women are excised after the Jewish custom.[731]\r\n\r\n10. Further still towards the south are the Cynamolgi,[732] called by\r\nthe natives Agrii, with long hair and long beards, who keep a breed of\r\nvery large dogs for hunting the Indian cattle which come into their\r\ncountry from the neighbouring district, driven thither either by wild\r\nbeasts or by scarcity of pasturage. The time of their incursion is from\r\nthe summer solstice to the middle of winter.\r\n\r\nNext to the harbour of Antiphilus is a port called the Grove of the\r\nColobi (or the Mutilated), the city Berenice[733] of Sabæ, and Sabæ[734]\r\na considerable city; then the grove of Eumenes.[735]\r\n\r\nAbove is the city Darada, and a hunting-ground for elephants, called “At\r\nthe Well.” The district is inhabited by the Elephantophagi (or\r\nElephant-eaters), who are occupied in hunting them. When they descry\r\nfrom the trees a herd of elephants directing their course through the\r\nforest, they do not [then] attack, but they approach by stealth and\r\nhamstring the hindmost stragglers from the herd. Some kill them with\r\nbows and arrows, the latter being dipped in the gall of serpents. The\r\nshooting with the bow is performed by three men, two, advancing in\r\nfront, hold the bow, and one draws the string. Others remark the trees\r\nagainst which the elephant is accustomed to rest, and, approaching on\r\nthe opposite side, cut the trunk of the tree low down. When the animal\r\ncomes and leans against it, the tree and the elephant fall down\r\ntogether. The elephant is unable to rise, because its legs are formed of\r\none piece of bone which is inflexible; the hunters leap down from the\r\ntrees, kill it, and cut it in pieces. The Nomades call the hunters\r\nAcatharti, or impure.\r\n\r\n11. Above this nation is situated a small tribe the Struthophagi[736]\r\n(or Bird-eaters), in whose country are birds of the size of deer, which\r\nare unable to fly, but run with the swiftness of the ostrich. Some hunt\r\nthem with bows and arrows, others covered with the skins of birds. They\r\nhide the right hand in the neck of the skin, and move it as the birds\r\nmove their necks. With the left hand they scatter grain from a bag\r\nsuspended to the side; they thus entice the birds, till they drive them\r\ninto pits, where the hunters despatch them with cudgels. The skins are\r\nused both as clothes and as coverings for beds. The Ethiopians called\r\nSimi are at war with these people, and use as weapons the horns of\r\nantelopes.\r\n\r\n12. Bordering on this people is a nation blacker in complexion than the\r\nothers,[737] shorter in stature, and very short-lived. They rarely live\r\nbeyond forty years; for the flesh [CAS. 772] of their bodies is eaten\r\nup with worms.[738] Their food consists of locusts, which the south-west\r\nand west winds, when they blow violently in the spring-time, drive in\r\nbodies into the country. The inhabitants catch them by throwing into the\r\nravines materials which cause a great deal of smoke, and light them\r\ngently. The locusts, as they fly across the smoke, are blinded and fall\r\ndown. They are pounded with salt, made into cakes, and eaten as food.\r\n\r\nAbove these people is situated a desert tract with extensive pastures.\r\nIt was abandoned in consequence of the multitudes of scorpions and\r\ntarantulas, called tetragnathi (or four-jawed), which formerly abounded\r\nto so great a degree as to occasion a complete desertion of the place\r\nlong since by its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n13. Next to the harbour of Eumenes, as far as Deire and the straits\r\nopposite the six islands,[739] live the Ichthyophagi, Creophagi, and\r\nColobi, who extend into the interior.\r\n\r\nMany hunting-grounds for elephants, and obscure cities and islands, lie\r\nin front of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe greater part are Nomades; husbandmen are few in number. In the\r\ncountry occupied by some of these nations styrax grows in large\r\nquantity. The Icthyophagi, on the ebbing of the tide, collect fish,\r\nwhich they cast upon the rocks and dry in the sun. When they have well\r\nbroiled them, the bones are piled in heaps, and the flesh trodden with\r\nthe feet is made into cakes, which are again exposed to the sun and used\r\nas food. In bad weather, when fish cannot be procured, the bones of\r\nwhich they have made heaps are pounded, made into cakes and eaten, but\r\nthey suck the fresh bones. Some also live upon shell-fish, when they are\r\nfattened, which is done by throwing them into holes and standing pools\r\nof the sea, where they are supplied with small fish, and used as food\r\nwhen other fish are scarce. They have various kinds of places for\r\npreserving and feeding fish, from whence they derive their supply.\r\n\r\nSome of the inhabitants of that part of the coast which is without water\r\ngo inland every five days, accompanied by all their families, with\r\nsongs and rejoicings, to the watering-places, where, throwing themselves\r\non their faces, they drink as beasts until their stomachs are distended\r\nlike a drum. They then return again to the sea-coast. They dwell in\r\ncaves or cabins, with roofs consisting of beams and rafters made of the\r\nbones and spines of whales, and covered with branches of the olive tree.\r\n\r\n14. The Chelonophagi (or Turtle-eaters) live under the cover of shells\r\n(of turtles), which are large enough to be used as boats. Some make of\r\nthe sea-weed, which is thrown up in large quantities, lofty and\r\nhill-like heaps, which are hollowed out, and underneath which they live.\r\nThey cast out the dead, which are carried away by the tide, as food for\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThere are three islands which follow in succession, the island of\r\nTortoises, the island of Seals, and the island of Hawks. Along the whole\r\ncoast there are plantations of palm trees, olive trees, and laurels, not\r\nonly within, but in a great part also without the straits.\r\n\r\nThere is also an island [called the island] of Philip, opposite to it\r\ninland is situated the hunting-ground for elephants, called the chase of\r\nPythangelus; then follows Arsinoë, a city with a harbour; after these\r\nplaces is Deire, and beyond them is a hunting-ground for elephants.\r\n\r\nFrom Deire, the next country is that which bears aromatic plants. The\r\nfirst produces myrrh, and belongs to the Icthyophagi and the Creophagi.\r\nIt bears also the persea, peach or Egyptian almond,[740] and the\r\nEgyptian fig. Beyond is Licha, a hunting-ground for elephants. There are\r\nalso in many places standing pools of rain-water. When these are dried\r\nup, the elephants, with their trunks and tusks, dig holes and find\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOn this coast there are two very large lakes extending as far as the\r\npromontory Pytholaus.[741] One of them contains salt water, and is\r\ncalled a sea; the other, fresh water, and is the haunt of hippopotami\r\nand crocodiles. On the margin grows the papyrus. The ibis is seen in the\r\nneighbourhood of this place. The people who live near the promontory of\r\nPytholaus (and beginning from this place) do not [CAS. 774] undergo any\r\nmutilation in any part of their body. Next is the country which produces\r\nfrankincense; it has a promontory and a temple with a grove of poplars.\r\nIn the inland parts is a tract along the banks of a river bearing the\r\nname of Isis, and another that of Nilus,[742] both of which produce\r\nmyrrh and frankincense. Also a lagoon filled with water from the\r\nmountains; next the watch-post of the Lion, and the port of Pythangelus.\r\nThe next tract bears the false cassia. There are many tracts in\r\nsuccession on the sides of rivers on which frankincense grows, and\r\nrivers extending to the cinnamon country. The river which bounds this\r\ntract produces (phlous) rushes[743] in great abundance. Then follows\r\nanother river, and the port of Daphnus,[744] and a valley called\r\nApollo’s, which bears, besides frankincense, myrrh and cinnamon. The\r\nlatter is more abundant in places far in the interior.\r\n\r\nNext is the mountain Elephas,[745] a mountain projecting into the sea,\r\nand a creek; then follows the large harbour of Psygmus, a watering-place\r\ncalled that of Cynocephali, and the last promontory of this coast,\r\nNotu-ceras (or the Southern Horn).[746] After doubling this cape towards\r\nthe south, we have no more descriptions, he says, of harbours or\r\nplaces, because nothing is known of the sea-coast beyond this\r\npoint.[747]\r\n\r\n15. Along the coast there are both pillars and altars of Pytholaus,\r\nLichas, Pythangelus, Leon, and Charimortus, that is, along the known\r\ncoast from Deire as far as Notu-ceras; but the distance is not\r\ndetermined. The country abounds with elephants and lions called myrmeces\r\n(ants).[748] They have their genital organs reversed. Their skin is of a\r\ngolden colour, but they are more bare than the lions of Arabia.\r\n\r\nIt produces also leopards of great strength and courage, and the\r\nrhinoceros. The rhinoceros is little inferior to the elephant; not,\r\naccording to Artemidorus, in length to the crest,[749] although he says\r\nhe had seen one at Alexandreia, but it is somewhat about [* * *\r\nless][750] in height, judging at least from the one I saw. Nor is the\r\ncolour the pale yellow of box-wood, but like that of the elephant.[751]\r\nIt was of the size of a bull. Its shape approached very nearly to that\r\nof the wild boar, and particularly the forehead; except the front, which\r\nis furnished with a hooked horn, harder than any bone. It uses it as a\r\nweapon, like the wild boar its tusks. It has also two hard welts, like\r\nfolds of serpents, encircling the body from the chine to the belly, one\r\non the withers, the other on the loins. This description is taken from\r\none which I myself saw. Artemidorus adds to his account of this animal,\r\nthat it is peculiarly inclined to dispute with the elephant for the\r\nplace of pasture; thrusting its forehead under the belly [of the\r\nelephant] and ripping it up, unless prevented by the trunk and tusks of\r\nhis adversary.\r\n\r\n16. Camel-leopards are bred in these parts, but they do not in any\r\nrespect resemble leopards, for their variegated skin is more like the\r\nstreaked and spotted skin of fallow deer. The [CAS. 775] hinder\r\nquarters are so very much lower than the fore quarters, that it seems as\r\nif the animal sat upon its rump, which is the height of an ox; the fore\r\nlegs are as long as those of the camel. The neck rises high and straight\r\nup, but the head greatly exceeds in height that of the camel. From this\r\nwant of proportion, the speed of the animal is not so great, I think, as\r\nit is described by Artemidorus, according to whom it is not to be\r\nsurpassed. It is not however a wild animal, but rather like a\r\ndomesticated beast; for it shows no signs of a savage disposition.\r\n\r\nThis country, continues Artemidorus, produces also sphinxes,[752]\r\ncynocephali,[753] and cebi,[754] which have the face of a lion, and the\r\nrest of the body like that of a panther; they are as large as deer.\r\nThere are wild bulls also, which are carnivorous, and greatly exceed\r\nours in size and swiftness. They are of a red colour. The crocuttas[755]\r\nis, according to this author, the mixed progeny of a wolf and a dog.\r\nWhat Metrodorus the Scepsian relates, in his book “on Custom,” is like\r\nfable, and is to be disregarded.\r\n\r\nArtemidorus mentions serpents also of thirty cubits in length, which can\r\nmaster elephants and bulls: in this he does not exaggerate.[756] But the\r\nIndian and African serpents are of a more fabulous size, and are said to\r\nhave grass growing on their backs.\r\n\r\n17. The mode of life among the Troglodytæ is nomadic. Each tribe is\r\ngoverned by tyrants. Their wives and children are common, except those\r\nof the tyrants. The offence of corrupting the wife of a tyrant is\r\npunished with the fine of a sheep.\r\n\r\nThe women carefully paint themselves with antimony. They wear about\r\ntheir necks shells, as a protection against fascination by witchcraft.\r\nIn their quarrels, which are for pastures, they first push away each\r\nother with their hands, they then use stones, or, if wounds are\r\ninflicted, arrows and daggers. The women put an end to these disputes,\r\nby going into the midst of the combatants and using prayers and\r\nentreaties.\r\n\r\nTheir food consists of flesh and bones pounded together, wrapped up in\r\nskins and then baked, or prepared after many other methods by the cooks,\r\nwho are called Acatharti, or impure. In this way they eat not only the\r\nflesh, but the bones and skins also.\r\n\r\nThey use (as an ointment for the body?) a mixture of blood and milk; the\r\ndrink of the people in general is an infusion of the paliurus\r\n(buckthorn);[757] that of the tyrants is mead; the honey being expressed\r\nfrom some kind of flower.\r\n\r\nTheir winter sets in when the Etesian winds begin to blow (for they have\r\nrain), and the remaining season is summer.\r\n\r\nThey go naked, or wear skins only, and carry clubs. They deprive\r\nthemselves of the prepuce,[758] but some are circumcised like Egyptians.\r\nThe Ethiopian Megabari have their clubs armed with iron knobs. They use\r\nspears and shields which are covered with raw hides. The other\r\nEthiopians use bows and lances. Some of the Troglodytæ, when they bury\r\ntheir dead, bind the body from the neck to the legs with twigs of the\r\nbuckthorn. They then immediately throw stones over the body, at the same\r\ntime laughing and rejoicing, until they have covered the face. They then\r\nplace over it a ram’s horn, and go away.\r\n\r\nThey travel by night; the male cattle have bells fastened to them, in\r\norder to drive away wild beasts with the sound. They use torches also\r\nand arrows in repelling them. They watch during the night, on account of\r\ntheir flocks, and sing some peculiar song around their fires.\r\n\r\n18. Having given this account of the Troglodytæ and of the neighbouring\r\nEthiopians, Artemidorus returns to the Arabians. Beginning from\r\nPoseidium, he first describes those who border upon the Arabian Gulf,\r\nand are opposite to the Troglodytæ. He says that Poseidium is situated\r\nwithin the bay of [Heroopolis],[759] and that contiguous to\r\nPoseidium[760] is a grove of palm trees,[761] well supplied with water,\r\nwhich is [CAS. 776] highly valued, because all the district around is\r\nburnt up and is without water or shade. But there the fertility of the\r\npalm is prodigious. A man and a woman are appointed by hereditary right\r\nto the guardianship of the grove. They wear skins, and live on dates.\r\nThey sleep in huts built on trees, the place being infested with\r\nmultitudes of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nNext is the island of Phocæ (Seals),[762] which has its name from those\r\nanimals, which abound there. Near it is a promontory,[763] which extends\r\ntowards Petra, of the Arabians called Nabatæi, and to the country of\r\nPalestine, to this [island] the Minæi,[764] Gerrhæi, and all the\r\nneighbouring nations repair with loads of aromatics.\r\n\r\nNext is another tract of sea-coast, formerly called the coast of the\r\nMaranitæ,[765] some of whom were husbandmen, others Scenitæ; but at\r\npresent it is occupied by Garindæi, who destroyed the former possessors\r\nby treachery. They attacked those who were assembled to celebrate some\r\nquinquennial festival, and put them to death; they then attacked and\r\nexterminated the rest of the tribe.[766]\r\n\r\nNext is the Ælanitic[767] Gulf and Nabatæa, a country well peopled, and\r\nabounding in cattle. The islands which lie near, and opposite, are\r\ninhabited by people who formerly lived without molesting others, but\r\nlatterly carried on a piratical warfare in rafts[768] against vessels on\r\ntheir way from Egypt. But they suffered reprisals, when an armament was\r\nsent out against them, which devastated their country.\r\n\r\nNext is a plain, well wooded and well supplied with water; it abounds\r\nwith cattle of all kinds, and, among other animals, mules, wild camels,\r\nharts, and hinds; lions also, leopards, and wolves are frequently to be\r\nfound. In front lies an island called Dia. Then follows a bay of about\r\n500 stadia in extent, closed in by mountains, the entrance into which is\r\nof difficult access. About it live people who are hunters of wild\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nNext are three desert islands, abounding with olive trees, not like\r\nthose in our own country, but an indigenous kind, which we call Ethiopic\r\nolives, the tears (or gum) of which have a medicinal virtue.\r\n\r\nThen follows a stony beach, which is succeeded by a rugged coast,[769]\r\nnot easily navigated by vessels, extending about 1000 stadia. It has few\r\nharbours and anchorages, for a rugged and lofty mountain stretches\r\nparallel to it; then the parts at its base, extending into the sea, form\r\nrocks under water, which, during the blowing of the Etesian winds and\r\nthe storms of that period, present dangers, when no assistance can be\r\nafforded to vessels.\r\n\r\nNext is a bay in which are some scattered islands,[770] and continuous\r\nwith the bay, are three very lofty mounds[771] of black sand. After\r\nthese is Charmothas[772] a harbour, about 100 stadia in circumference,\r\nwith a narrow entrance very dangerous for all kinds of vessels. A river\r\nempties itself into it. In the middle is a well-wooded island, adapted\r\nfor cultivation.\r\n\r\nThen follows a rugged coast, and after that are some bays and a country\r\nbelonging to Nomades, who live by their camels. They fight from their\r\nbacks; they travel upon them, and subsist on their milk and flesh. A\r\nriver flows [CAS. 777] through their country, which brings down\r\ngold-dust, but they are ignorant how to make any use of it. They are\r\ncalled Debæ;[773] some of them are Nomades, others husbandmen.\r\n\r\nI do not mention the greater part[774] of the names of these nations, on\r\naccount of the obscurity of the people, and because the pronunciation of\r\nthem is strange[775] [and uncouth].\r\n\r\nNear these people is a nation more civilized, who inhabit a district\r\nwith a more temperate climate; for it is well watered, and has frequent\r\nshowers.[776] Fossil gold is found there, not in the form of dust, but\r\nin lumps, which do not require much purification. The least pieces are\r\nof the size of a nut, the middle size of a medlar, the largest of a\r\nwalnut. These are pierced and arranged alternately with transparent\r\nstones strung on threads and formed into collars. They are worn round\r\nthe neck and wrists. They sell the gold to their neighbours at a cheap\r\nrate, exchanging it for three times the quantity of brass, and double\r\nthe quantity of iron,[777] through ignorance of the mode of working the\r\ngold, and the scarcity of the commodities received in exchange, which\r\nare more necessary for the purposes of life.\r\n\r\n19. The country of the Sabæi,[778] a very populous nation, is\r\ncontiguous, and is the most fertile of all, producing myrrh,\r\nfrankincense, and cinnamon. On the coast is found balsamum and another\r\nkind of herb of a very fragrant smell, but which is soon dissipated.\r\nThere are also sweet-smelling palms and the calamus. There are snakes\r\nalso of a dark red colour, a span in length, which spring up as high as\r\na man’s waist, and whose bite is incurable.\r\n\r\nOn account of the abundance which the soil produces, the people are lazy\r\nand indolent in their mode of life. The lower class of people live on\r\nroots, and sleep on the trees.\r\n\r\nThe people who live near each other receive, in continued succession,\r\nthe loads [of perfumes] and deliver them to others, who convey them as\r\nfar as Syria and Mesopotamia. When the carriers become drowsy by the\r\nodour of the aromatics, the drowsiness is removed by the fumes of\r\nasphaltus and of goat’s beard.\r\n\r\nMariaba,[779] the capital of the Sabæans, is situated upon a mountain,\r\nwell wooded. A king resides there, who determines absolutely all\r\ndisputes and other matters; but he is forbidden to leave his palace, or\r\nif he does so, the rabble immediately assail him with stones, according\r\nto the direction of an oracle. He himself, and those about his person,\r\npass their lives in effeminate voluptuousness.\r\n\r\nThe people cultivate the ground, or follow the trade of dealing in\r\naromatics, both the indigenous sort and those brought from Ethiopia; in\r\norder to procure them, they sail through the straits in vessels covered\r\nwith skins. There is such an abundance of these aromatics, that\r\ncinnamon, cassia, and other spices are used by them instead of sticks\r\nand firewood.\r\n\r\nIn the country of the Sabæans is found the larimnum, a most fragrant\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\nBy the trade [in these aromatics] both the Sabæans and the Gerrhæi have\r\nbecome the richest of all the tribes, and possess a great quantity of\r\nwrought articles in gold and silver, [CAS. 778] as couches, tripods,\r\nbasins, drinking-vessels, to which we must add the costly magnificence\r\nof their houses; for the doors, walls, and roofs are variegated with\r\ninlaid ivory, gold, silver, and precious stones.\r\n\r\nThis is the account of Artemidorus.[780] The rest of the description is\r\npartly similar to that of Eratosthenes, and partly derived from other\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\n20. Some of these say, that the sea is red from the colour arising from\r\nreflection either from the sun, which is vertical, or from the\r\nmountains, which are red by being scorched with intense heat; for the\r\ncolour, it is supposed, may be produced by both these causes. Ctesias of\r\nCnidus speaks of a spring which discharges into the sea a red and\r\nochrous water. Agatharchides, his fellow-citizen, relates, on the\r\nauthority of a person of the name of Boxus, of Persian descent, that\r\nwhen a troop of horses was driven by a lioness in heat as far as the\r\nsea, and had passed over to an island, a Persian of the name of Erythras\r\nconstructed a raft, and was the first person who crossed the sea to it;\r\nperceiving the island to be well adapted for inhabitants, he drove the\r\nherd back to Persia, and sent out colonists both to this and the other\r\nislands and to the coast. He [thus] gave his own name to the sea. But\r\naccording to others, it was Erythras the son of Perseus who was the king\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\nAccording to some writers, from the straits in the Arabian Gulf to the\r\nextremity of the cinnamon country is a distance of 5000 stadia,[781]\r\nwithout distinguishing whether (the direction is) to the south or to the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nIt is said also that the emerald and the beryl are found in the gold\r\nmines. According to Poseidonius, an odoriferous salt is found in Arabia.\r\n\r\n21. The Nabatæans and Sabæans, situated above Syria, are the first\r\npeople who occupy Arabia Felix. They were frequently in the habit of\r\noverrunning this country before the Romans became masters of it, but at\r\npresent both they and the Syrians are subject to the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Nabatæans is called Petra. It is situated on a spot\r\nwhich is surrounded and fortified by a smooth and level rock (petra),\r\nwhich externally is abrupt and precipitous, but within there are\r\nabundant springs of water both for domestic purposes and for watering\r\ngardens. Beyond the enclosure the country is for the most part a desert,\r\nparticularly towards Judæa. Through this is the shortest road to\r\nJericho, a journey of three or four days, and five days to the Phœnicon\r\n(or palm plantation). It is always governed by a king of the royal race.\r\nThe king has a minister who is one of the Companions, and is called\r\nBrother. It has excellent laws for the administration of public affairs.\r\n\r\nAthenodorus, a philosopher, and my friend, who had been at Petra, used\r\nto relate with surprise, that he found many Romans and also many other\r\nstrangers residing there. He observed the strangers frequently engaged\r\nin litigation, both with one another and with the natives; but the\r\nnatives had never any dispute amongst themselves, and lived together in\r\nperfect harmony.\r\n\r\n22. The late expedition[782] of the Romans against the Arabians, under\r\nthe command of Ælius Gallus, has made us acquainted with many\r\npeculiarities of the country. Augustus Cæsar despatched this general to\r\nexplore the nature of these [CAS. 779] places and their inhabitants, as\r\nwell as those of Ethiopia; for he observed that Troglodytica, which is\r\ncontiguous to Egypt, bordered upon Ethiopia; and that the Arabian Gulf\r\nwas extremely narrow, where it separates the Arabians from the\r\nTroglodytæ. It was his intention either to conciliate or subdue the\r\nArabians. He was also influenced by the report, which had prevailed from\r\nall time, that this people were very wealthy, and exchanged their\r\naromatics and precious stones for silver and gold, but never expended\r\nwith foreigners any part of what they received in exchange. He hoped to\r\nacquire either opulent friends, or to overcome opulent enemies. He was\r\nmoreover encouraged to undertake this enterprise by the expectation of\r\nassistance from the Nabatæans, who promised to co-operate with him in\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n23. Upon these inducements Gallus set out on the expedition. But he was\r\ndeceived by Syllæus, the [king’s] minister of the Nabatæans, who had\r\npromised to be his guide on the march, and to assist him in the\r\nexecution of his design. Syllæus was however treacherous throughout; for\r\nhe neither guided them by a safe course by sea along the coast, nor by a\r\nsafe road for the army, as he promised, but exposed both the fleet and\r\nthe army to danger, by directing them where there was no road, or the\r\nroad was impracticable, where they were obliged to make long circuits,\r\nor to pass through tracts of country destitute of everything; he led the\r\nfleet along a rocky coast without harbours, or to places abounding with\r\nrocks concealed under water, or with shallows. In places of this\r\ndescription particularly, the flowing and ebbing of the tide did them\r\nthe most harm.\r\n\r\nThe first mistake consisted in building long vessels [of war] at a time\r\nwhen there was no war, nor any likely to occur by sea. For the Arabians,\r\nbeing mostly engaged in traffic and commerce, are not a very warlike\r\npeople even on land, much less so at sea. Gallus, notwithstanding, built\r\nnot less than eighty biremes and triremes and galleys (phaseli) at\r\nCleopatris,[783] near the old canal which leads from the Nile. When he\r\ndiscovered his mistake, he constructed a hundred and thirty vessels of\r\nburden, in which he embarked with about ten thousand infantry, collected\r\nfrom Egypt, consisting of Romans and allies, among whom were five\r\nhundred Jews and a thousand Nabatæans, under the command of Syllæus.\r\nAfter enduring great hardships and distress, he arrived on the fifteenth\r\nday at Leuce-Come, a large mart in the territory of the Nabatæans, with\r\nthe loss of many of his vessels, some with all their crews, in\r\nconsequence of the difficulty of the navigation, but by no opposition\r\nfrom an enemy. These misfortunes were occasioned by the perfidy of\r\nSyllæus, who insisted that there was no road for an army by land to\r\nLeuce-Come, to which and from which place the camel-traders travel with\r\nease and in safety from Petra, and back to Petra, with so large a body\r\nof men and camels as to differ in no respect from an army.\r\n\r\n24. Another cause of the failure of the expedition was the fact of king\r\nObodas not paying much attention to public affairs, and especially to\r\nthose relative to war (as is the custom with all Arabian kings), but\r\nplaced everything in the power of Syllæus the minister. His whole\r\nconduct in command of the army was perfidious, and his object was, as I\r\nsuppose, to examine as a spy the state of the country, and to destroy,\r\nin concert with the Romans, certain cities and tribes: and when the\r\nRomans should be consumed by famine, fatigue, and disease, and by all\r\nthe evils which he had treacherously contrived, to declare himself\r\nmaster of the whole country.\r\n\r\nGallus however arrived at Leuce-Come, with the army labouring under\r\nstomacacce and scelotyrbe, diseases of the country, the former affecting\r\nthe mouth, the other the legs, with a kind of paralysis, caused by the\r\nwater and the plants [which the soldiers had used in their food]. He was\r\ntherefore compelled to pass the summer and the winter there, for the\r\nrecovery of the sick.\r\n\r\nMerchandise is conveyed from Leuce-Come to Petra, thence to Rhinocolura\r\nin Phœnicia, near Egypt, and thence to other nations. But at present the\r\ngreater part is transported by the Nile to Alexandreia. It is brought\r\ndown from Arabia and India to Myus Hormus, it is then conveyed on camels\r\nto Coptus[784] of the Thebaïs, situated on a canal of the Nile, and to\r\nAlexandreia. Gallus, setting out again from Leuce-Come on his return\r\nwith his army, and through the treachery of his guide, traversed such\r\ntracts of country, that the army was obliged to carry water with them\r\nupon camels. After a [CAS. 781] march of many days, therefore, he came\r\nto the territory of Aretas, who was related to Obodas. Aretas received\r\nhim in a friendly manner, and offered presents. But by the treachery of\r\nSyllæus, Gallus was conducted by a difficult road through the country;\r\nfor he occupied thirty days in passing through it. It afforded barley, a\r\nfew palm trees, and butter instead of oil.\r\n\r\nThe next country to which he came belonged to Nomades, and was in great\r\npart a complete desert. It was called Ararene. The king of the country\r\nwas Sabos. Gallus spent fifty days in passing through this territory,\r\nfor want of roads, and came to a city of the Negrani, and to a fertile\r\ncountry peacefully disposed. The king had fled, and the city was taken\r\nat the first onset. After a march of six days from thence, he came to\r\nthe river. Here the barbarians attacked the Romans, and lost about ten\r\nthousand men; the Romans lost only two men. For the barbarians were\r\nentirely inexperienced in war, and used their weapons unskilfully, which\r\nwere bows, spears, swords, and slings; but the greater part of them\r\nwielded a double-edged axe. Immediately afterwards he took the city\r\ncalled Asca, which had been abandoned by the king. He thence came to a\r\ncity Athrula, and took it without resistance; having placed a garrison\r\nthere, and collected provisions for the march, consisting of corn and\r\ndates, he proceeded to a city Marsiaba, belonging to the nation of the\r\nRhammanitæ, who were subjects of Ilasarus. He assaulted and besieged it\r\nfor six days, but raised the siege in consequence of a scarcity of\r\nwater. He was two days’ march from the aromatic region, as he was\r\ninformed by his prisoners. He occupied in his marches a period of six\r\nmonths, in consequence of the treachery of his guides. This he\r\ndiscovered when he was returning; and although he was late in\r\ndiscovering the design against him, he had time to take another road\r\nback; for he arrived in nine days at Negrana, where the battle was\r\nfought, and thence in eleven days he came to the “Seven Wells,” as the\r\nplace is called from the fact of their existing there. Thence he marched\r\nthrough a desert country, and came to Chaalla a village, and then to\r\nanother called Malothas, situated on a river. His road then lay through\r\na desert country, which had only a few watering-places, as far as\r\nEgra[785] a village. It belongs to the territory of Obodas, and is\r\nsituated upon the sea. He accomplished on his return the whole distance\r\nin sixty days, in which, on his first journey, he had consumed six\r\nmonths. From Negra he conducted his army in eleven days to Myus Hormus;\r\nthence across the country to Coptus, and arrived at Alexandreia with so\r\nmuch of his army could be saved. The remainder he lost, not by the\r\nenemy, but by disease, fatigue, famine, and marches through bad roads;\r\nfor seven men only perished in battle. For these reasons this expedition\r\ncontributed little in extending our knowledge of the country. It was\r\nhowever of some small service.\r\n\r\nSyllæus, the author of these disasters, was punished for his treachery\r\nat Rome. He affected friendship, but he was convicted of other offences,\r\nbesides perfidy in this instance, and was beheaded.\r\n\r\n25. The aromatic country, as I have before said,[786] is divided into\r\nfour parts. Of aromatics, the frankincense and myrrh are said to be the\r\nproduce of trees, but cassia the growth of bushes; yet some writers say,\r\nthat the greater part (of the cassia) is brought from India, and that\r\nthe best frankincense is that from Persia.\r\n\r\nAccording to another partition of the country, the whole of Arabia Felix\r\nis divided into five kingdoms (or portions), one of which comprises the\r\nfighting men, who fight for all the rest; another contains the\r\nhusbandmen, by whom the rest are supplied with food; another includes\r\nthose who work at mechanical trades. One division comprises the myrrh\r\nregion; another the frankincense region, although the same tracts\r\nproduce cassia, cinnamon, and nard. Trades are not changed from one\r\nfamily to another, but each workman continues to exercise that of his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of their wine is made from the palm.\r\n\r\nA man’s brothers are held in more respect than his children. The\r\ndescendants of the royal family succeed as kings, and are invested with\r\nother governments, according to primogeniture. Property is common among\r\nall the relations. The eldest is the chief. There is one wife among them\r\nall. He who enters [CAS. 783] the house before any of the rest, has\r\nintercourse with her, having placed his staff at the door; for it is a\r\nnecessary custom, which every one is compelled to observe, to carry a\r\nstaff. The woman however passes the night with the eldest. Hence the\r\nmale children are all brothers. They have sexual intercourse also with\r\ntheir mothers. Adultery is punished with death, but an adulterer must\r\nbelong to another family.\r\n\r\nA daughter of one of the kings was of extraordinary beauty, and had\r\nfifteen brothers, who were all in love with her, and were her unceasing\r\nand successive visitors; she, being at last weary of their importunity,\r\nis said to have employed the following device. She procured staves to be\r\nmade similar to those of her brothers; when one left the house, she\r\nplaced before the door a staff similar to the first, and a little time\r\nafterwards another, and so on in succession, but making her calculation\r\nso that the person who intended to visit her might not have one similar\r\nto that at her door. On an occasion when the brothers were all of them\r\ntogether at the market-place, one left it, and came to the door of the\r\nhouse; seeing the staff there, and conjecturing some one to be in her\r\napartment, and having left all the other brothers at the market-place,\r\nhe suspected the person to be an adulterer; running therefore in haste\r\nto his father, he brought him with him to the house, but it was proved\r\nthat he had falsely accused his sister.\r\n\r\n26. The Nabatæans are prudent, and fond of accumulating property. The\r\ncommunity fine a person who has diminished his substance, and confer\r\nhonours on him who has increased it. They have few slaves, and are\r\nserved for the most part by their relations, or by one another, or each\r\nperson is his own servant; and this custom extends even to their kings.\r\nThey eat their meals in companies consisting of thirteen persons. Each\r\nparty is attended by two musicians. But the king gives many\r\nentertainments in great buildings. No one drinks more than eleven\r\n[appointed] cupfuls, from separate cups, each of gold.\r\n\r\nThe king courts popular favour so much, that he is not only his own\r\nservant, but sometimes he himself ministers to others. He frequently\r\nrenders an account [of his administration] before the people, and\r\nsometimes an inquiry is made into his mode of life.\r\n\r\nThe houses are sumptuous, and of stone. The cities are without walls, on\r\naccount of the peace [which prevails among them]. A great part of the\r\ncountry is fertile, and produces everything except oil of olives;\r\n[instead of it], the oil of sesamum is used. The sheep have white\r\nfleeces, their oxen are large; but the country produces no horses.[787]\r\nCamels are the substitute for horses, and perform the [same kind of]\r\nlabour. They wear no tunics, but have a girdle about the loins, and walk\r\nabroad in sandals.[788] The dress of the kings is the same, but the\r\ncolour is purple.\r\n\r\nSome merchandise is altogether imported into the country, others are not\r\naltogether imports, especially as some articles are native products, as\r\ngold and silver, and many of the aromatics; but brass and iron, purple\r\ngarments, styrax, saffron, and costus (or white cinnamon), pieces of\r\nsculpture, paintings, statues, are not to be procured in the country.\r\n\r\nThey look upon the bodies of the dead as no better than dung, according\r\nto the words of Heracleitus, “dead bodies more fit to be cast out than\r\ndung;” wherefore they bury even their kings beside dung-heaps. They\r\nworship the sun, and construct the altar on the top of a house, pouring\r\nout libations and burning frankincense upon it every day.\r\n\r\n27. When the poet says,\r\n\r\n   “I went to the country of the Ethiopians, Sidonians, and Erembi,”[789]\r\n\r\nit is doubtful, what people he means by Sidonians, whether those who\r\nlived near the Persian Gulf, a colony from which nation are the\r\nSidonians in our quarter (in the same manner as historians relate, that\r\nsome Tyrian islanders are found there, and Aradii, from whom the Aradii\r\nin our country derive their origin), or whether the poet means actually\r\nthe Sidonians themselves.\r\n\r\nBut there is more doubt about the Erembi, whether we are to suppose that\r\nhe means the Troglodytæ, according to the opinion of those who, by a\r\nforced etymology, derive the word Erembi from ἔραν ἐμβαίνειν, that is,\r\n“entering into the earth,” or whether he means the Arabians. Zeno the\r\nphilosopher of our sect alters the reading in this manner,\r\n\r\n   “And Sidoni, and Arabes;”\r\n\r\n[CAS. 784] but Poseidonius alters it with a small variation,\r\n\r\n   “And Sidonii, and Arambi,”\r\n\r\nas if the poet gave the name Arambi to the present Arabians, from their\r\nbeing so called by others in his time. He says also, that the situation\r\nof these three nations close to one another indicates a descent from\r\nsome common stock, and that on this account they are called by names\r\nhaving a resemblance to one another, as Armenii, Aramæi, Arambi. For as\r\nwe may suppose one nation to have been divided into three (according to\r\nthe differences of latitude [in which they lived], which successively\r\nbecame more marked [in proceeding from one to the other]), so in like\r\nmanner we may suppose that several names were adopted in place of one.\r\nThe proposed change of reading to Eremni is not probable, for that name\r\nis more applicable to the Ethiopians. The poet mentions also the Arimi,\r\nwhom Poseidonius says are meant here, and not a place in Syria or\r\nCilicia, or any other country, but Syria itself. For the Aramæi lived\r\nthere. Perhaps these are the people whom the Greeks called Arimæi or\r\nArimi. But the alterations of names, especially of barbarous nations,\r\nare frequent, Thus Darius was called Darieces; Parysatis, Pharziris;\r\nAthara, Atargata, whom Ctesias again calls Derceto.[790]\r\n\r\nAlexander might be adduced to bear witness to the wealth of the\r\nArabians, for he intended, it is said, after his return from India, to\r\nmake Arabia the seat of empire. All his enterprises terminated with his\r\ndeath, which happened suddenly; but certainly one of his projects was to\r\ntry whether the Arabians would receive him voluntarily, or resist him by\r\nforce of arms; for having found that they did not send ambassadors to\r\nhim, either before or after his expedition to India, he was beginning to\r\nmake preparations for war, as we have said in a former part of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XVII.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Seventeenth Book contains the whole of Egypt and Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we were describing Arabia, we included in the description the gulfs\r\nwhich compress and make it a peninsula, namely the Gulfs of Arabia and\r\nof Persis. We described at the same time some parts of Egypt, and those\r\nof Ethiopia, inhabited by the Troglodytæ, and by the people situated\r\nnext to them, extending to the confines of the Cinnamon country.[791]\r\n\r\nWe are now to describe the remaining parts contiguous to these nations,\r\nand situated about the Nile. We shall then give an account of Africa,\r\nwhich remains to complete this treatise on Geography.\r\n\r\nAnd here we must previously adduce the opinions of Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\n2. He says, that the Nile is distant from the Arabian Gulf towards the\r\nwest 1000 stadia, and that it resembles (in its course) the letter N\r\nreversed. For after flowing, he says, about 2700 stadia from Meroë\r\ntowards the north, it turns again to the south, and to the winter\r\nsunset, continuing its course for about 3700 stadia, when it is almost\r\nin the latitude of the places about Meroë. Then entering far into\r\nAfrica, and having made another bend, it flows towards the north, a\r\ndistance of 5300 stadia, to the great cataract;[792] and inclining a\r\nlittle to the east, traverses a distance of 1200 stadia to the smaller\r\ncataract at Syene,[793] and 5300 stadia more to the sea.[794]\r\n\r\n[CAS. 786] Two rivers empty themselves into it, which issue out of\r\nsome lakes towards the east, and encircle Meroë, a considerable\r\nisland.[795] One of these rivers is called Astaboras,[796] flowing along\r\nthe eastern side of the island. The other is the Astapus, or, as some\r\ncall it, Astasobas. But the Astapus[797] is said to be another river,\r\nwhich issues out of some lakes on the south, and that this river forms\r\nnearly the body of the (stream of the) Nile which flows in a straight\r\nline, and that it is filled by the summer rains; that above the\r\nconfluence of the Astaboras and the Nile, at the distance of 700 stadia,\r\nis Meroë, a city having the same name as the island; and that there is\r\nanother island above Meroë, occupied by the fugitive Egyptians, who\r\nrevolted in the time of Psammitichus,[798] and are called Sembritæ, or\r\nforeigners. Their sovereign is a queen, but they obey the king of Meroë.\r\n\r\nThe lower parts of the country on each side Meroë, along the Nile\r\ntowards the Red Sea, are occupied by Megabari and Blemmyes, who are\r\nsubject to the Ethiopians, and border upon the Egyptians; about the sea\r\nare Troglodytæ. The Troglodytæ, in the latitude of Meroë, are distant\r\nten or twelve days’ journey from the Nile. On the left of the course of\r\nthe Nile live Nubæ in Libya, a populous nation. They begin [CAS. 787]\r\nfrom Meroë, and extend as far as the bends (of the river). They are not\r\nsubject to the Ethiopians, but live independently, being distributed\r\ninto several sovereignties.\r\n\r\nThe extent of Egypt along the sea, from the Pelusiac to the Canobic\r\nmouth, is 1300 stadia.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\n3. We must, however, enter into a further detail of particulars. And\r\nfirst, we must speak of the parts about Egypt, proceeding from those\r\nthat are better known to those which follow next in order.\r\n\r\nThe Nile produces some common effects in this and the contiguous tract\r\nof country, namely, that of the Ethiopians above it, in watering them at\r\nthe time of its rise, and leaving those parts only habitable which have\r\nbeen covered by the inundation; it intersects the higher lands, and all\r\nthe tract elevated above its current on both sides, which however are\r\nuninhabited and a desert, from an absolute want of water. But the Nile\r\ndoes not traverse the whole of Ethiopia, nor alone, nor in a straight\r\nline, nor a country which is well inhabited. But Egypt it traverses both\r\nalone and entirely, and in a straight line, from the lesser cataract\r\nabove Syene and Elephantina, (which are the boundaries of Egypt and\r\nEthiopia,) to the mouths by which it discharges itself into the sea. The\r\nEthiopians at present lead for the most part a wandering life, and are\r\ndestitute of the means of subsistence, on account of the barrenness of\r\nthe soil, the disadvantages of climate, and their great distance from\r\nus.\r\n\r\nNow the contrary is the case with the Egyptians in all these respects.\r\nFor they have lived from the first under a regular form of government,\r\nthey were a people of civilized manners, and were settled in a\r\nwell-known country; their institutions have been recorded and mentioned\r\nin terms of praise, for they seemed to have availed themselves of the\r\nfertility of their country in the best possible manner by the partition\r\nof it (and by the classification of persons) which they adopted, and by\r\ntheir general care.\r\n\r\nWhen they had appointed a king, they divided the people into three\r\nclasses, into soldiers, husbandmen, and priests. The latter had the care\r\nof everything relating to sacred things (of the gods), the others of\r\nwhat related to man; some had the management of warlike affairs, others\r\nattended to the concerns of peace, the cultivation of the ground, and\r\nthe practice of the arts, from which the king derived his revenue.\r\n\r\nThe priests devoted themselves to the study of philosophy and astronomy,\r\nand were companions of the kings.\r\n\r\nThe country was at first divided into nomes.[799] The Thebaïs contained\r\nten, the Delta ten, and the intermediate tract sixteen. But according to\r\nsome writers, all the nomes together amounted to the number of chambers\r\nin the Labyrinth. Now these were less than thirty [six]. The nomes were\r\nagain divided into other sections. The greater number of the nomes were\r\ndistributed into toparchies, and these again into other sections; the\r\nsmallest portions were the arouræ.\r\n\r\nAn exact and minute division of the country was required by the frequent\r\nconfusion of boundaries occasioned at the time of the rise of the Nile,\r\nwhich takes away, adds, and alters the various shapes of the bounds, and\r\nobliterates other marks by which the property of one person is\r\ndistinguished [CAS. 787] from that of another. It was consequently\r\nnecessary to measure the land repeatedly. Hence it is said geometry\r\noriginated here, as the art of keeping accounts and arithmetic\r\noriginated with the Phœnicians, in consequence of their commerce.[800]\r\n\r\nAs the whole population of the country, so the separate population in\r\neach nome, was divided into three classes; the territory also was\r\ndivided into three equal portions.\r\n\r\nThe attention and care bestowed upon the Nile is so great to cause\r\nindustry to triumph over nature. The ground by nature, and still more by\r\nbeing supplied with water, produces a great abundance of fruits. By\r\nnature also a greater rise of the river irrigates a larger tract of\r\nland; but industry has completely succeeded in rectifying the deficiency\r\nof nature, so that in seasons when the rise of the river has been less\r\nthan usual, as large a portion of the country is irrigated by means of\r\ncanals and embankments, as in seasons when the rise of the river has\r\nbeen greater.\r\n\r\nBefore the times of Petronius there was the greatest plenty, and the\r\nrise of the river was the greatest when it rose to the height of\r\nfourteen cubits; but when it rose to eight only, a famine ensued. During\r\nthe government of Petronius, however, when the Nile rose twelve cubits\r\nonly, there was a most abundant crop; and once when it mounted to eight\r\nonly, no famine followed. Such then is the nature of this provision for\r\nthe physical state of the country. We shall now proceed to the next\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n4. The Nile, when it leaves the boundaries of Ethiopia, flows in a\r\nstraight line towards the north, to the tract called the Delta, then\r\n“cloven at the head,” (according to the expression of Plato,) makes this\r\npoint the vertex, as it were, of a triangle, the sides of which are\r\nformed by the streams, which separate on each side, and extend to the\r\nsea, one on the right hand to Pelusium, the other on the left to Canobus\r\nand the neighbouring Heracleium, as it is called; the base is the coast\r\nlying between Pelusium and the Heracleium.\r\n\r\nAn island was therefore formed by the sea and by both streams of the\r\nriver, which is called Delta from the resemblance of its shape to the\r\nletter (Δ) of that name. The spot at the vertex of the triangle has the\r\nsame appellation, because it is the beginning of the above-mentioned\r\ntriangular figure. The village, also, situated upon it is called Delta.\r\n\r\nThese then are two mouths of the Nile, one of which is called the\r\nPelusiac, the other the Canobic and Heracleiotic mouth. Between these\r\nare five other outlets, some of which are considerable, but the greater\r\npart are of inferior importance. For many others branch off from the\r\nprincipal streams, and are distributed over the whole of the island of\r\nthe Delta, and form many streams and islands; so that the whole Delta is\r\naccessible to boats, one canal succeeding another, and navigated with so\r\nmuch ease, that some persons make use of rafts[801] floated on earthen\r\npots, to transport them from place to place.\r\n\r\nThe whole island is about 3000 stadia in circumference, and is called,\r\nas also the lower country, with the land on the opposite sides of the\r\nstreams, the Delta.\r\n\r\nBut at the time of the rising of the Nile, the whole country is covered,\r\nand resembles a sea, except the inhabited spots, which are situated upon\r\nnatural hills or mounds; and considerable cities and villages appear\r\nlike islands in the distant prospect.\r\n\r\nThe water, after having continued on the ground more than forty days in\r\nsummer, then subsides by degrees, in the same manner as it rose. In\r\nsixty days the plain is entirely exposed to view, and dries up. The\r\nsooner the land is dry, so much the sooner the ploughing and sowing are\r\naccomplished, and it dries earlier in those parts where the heat is\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nThe country above the Delta is irrigated in the same manner, except that\r\nthe river flows in a straight line to the distance of about 4000 stadia\r\nin one channel, unless where some island intervenes, the most\r\nconsiderable of which comprises the Heracleiotic Nome; or, where it is\r\ndiverted by a canal into a large lake, or a tract of country which it is\r\ncapable of irrigating, as the lake Mœris and the Arsinoïte Nome, or\r\nwhere the canals discharge themselves into the Mareotis.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 789] In short, Egypt, from the mountains of Ethiopia to the vertex\r\nof the Delta, is merely a river tract on each side of the Nile, and\r\nrarely if anywhere comprehends in one continued line a habitable\r\nterritory of 300 stadia in breadth. It resembles, except the frequent\r\ndiversions of its course, a bandage rolled out.[802]\r\n\r\nThe mountains on each side (of the Nile), which descend from the parts\r\nabout Syene to the Egyptian Sea,[803] give this shape to the river tract\r\nof which I am speaking, and to the country. For in proportion as these\r\nmountains extend along that tract, or recede from each other, in the\r\nsame degree is the river contracted or expanded, and they impart to the\r\nhabitable country its variety of shape. But the country beyond the\r\nmountains is in a great measure uninhabited.\r\n\r\n5. The ancients understood more by conjecture than otherwise, but\r\npersons in later times learnt by experience as eye-witnesses, that the\r\nNile owes its rise to summer rains, which fall in great abundance in\r\nUpper Ethiopia, particularly in the most distant mountains. On the rains\r\nceasing, the fulness of the river gradually subsides. This was\r\nparticularly observed by those who navigated the Arabian Gulf on their\r\nway to the Cinnamon country, and by those who were sent out to hunt\r\nelephants, or for such other purposes as induced the Ptolemies, kings of\r\nEgypt, to despatch persons in that direction. These sovereigns had\r\ndirected their attention to objects of this kind, particularly Ptolemy\r\nsurnamed Philadelphus, who was a lover of science, and on account of\r\nbodily infirmities always in search of some new diversion and amusement.\r\nBut the ancient kings paid little attention to such inquiries, although\r\nboth they and the priests, with whom they passed the greater part of\r\ntheir lives, professed to be devoted to the study of philosophy. Their\r\nignorance therefore is more surprising, both on this account and because\r\nSesostris had traversed the whole of Ethiopia as far as the Cinnamon\r\ncountry, of which expedition monuments exist even to the present day,\r\nsuch as pillars and inscriptions. Cambyses also, when he was in\r\npossession of Egypt, had advanced with the Egyptians as far even as\r\nMeroë; and it is said that he gave this name both to the island and to\r\nthe city, because his sister, or according to some writers his wife,\r\nMeroë died there. For this reason therefore he conferred the appellation\r\non the island, and in honour of a woman. It is surprising how, with such\r\nopportunities of obtaining information, the history of these rains\r\nshould not have been clearly known to persons living in those times,\r\nespecially as the priests registered with the greatest diligence in the\r\nsacred books all extraordinary facts, and preserved records of\r\neverything which seemed to contribute to an increase of knowledge. And,\r\nif this had been the case, would it be necessary to inquire what is even\r\nstill a question, what can possibly be the reason why rain falls in\r\nsummer, and not in winter, in the most southerly parts of the country,\r\nbut not in the Thebaïs, nor in the country about Syene? nor should we\r\nhave to examine whether the rise of the water of the Nile is occasioned\r\nby rains, nor require such evidence for these facts as Poseidonius\r\nadduces. For he says, that Callisthenes asserts that the cause of the\r\nrise of the river is the rain of summer. This he borrows from Aristotle,\r\nwho borrowed it from Thrasyalces the Thasian (one of the ancient writers\r\non physics), Thrasyalces from some other person, and he from Homer, who\r\ncalls the Nile “heaven-descended:”\r\n\r\n   “back to Egypt’s heaven-descended stream.”[804]\r\n\r\nBut I quit this subject, since it has been discussed by many writers,\r\namong whom it will be sufficient to specify two, who have (each)\r\ncomposed in our times a treatise on the Nile, Eudorus and Aristo the\r\nPeripatetic philosopher. [They differ little from each other] except in\r\nthe order and disposition of the works, for the phraseology and\r\nexecution is the same in both writers. (I can speak with some confidence\r\nin this matter), for when at a loss (for manuscripts) for the purpose of\r\ncomparison and copy, I collated both authors.[805] But which of them\r\nsurreptitiously substituted the other’s account as his own, we may\r\n[CAS. 790] go to the temple of Ammon to be informed. Eudorus accused\r\nAristo, but the style is more like that of Aristo.\r\n\r\nThe ancients gave the name of Egypt to that country only which was\r\ninhabited and watered by the Nile, and the extent they assigned to it\r\nwas from the neighbourhood of Syene to the sea. But later writers, to\r\nthe present time, have included on the eastern side almost all the tract\r\nbetween the Arabian Gulf and the Nile (the Æthiopians however do not\r\nmake much use of the Red Sea); on the western side, the tract extending\r\nto the Auases and the parts of the sea-coast from the Canobic mouth of\r\nthe Nile to Catabathmus, and the kingdom of Cyrenæa. For the kings who\r\nsucceeded the race of the Ptolemies had acquired so much power, that\r\nthey became masters of Cyrenæa, and even joined Cyprus to Egypt. The\r\nRomans, who succeeded to their dominions, separated Egypt, and confined\r\nit within the old limits.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians give the name of Auases (Oases) to certain inhabited\r\ntracts, which are surrounded by extensive deserts, and appear like\r\nislands in the sea. They are frequently met with in Libya, and there are\r\nthree contiguous to Egypt, and dependent upon it.\r\n\r\nThis is the account which we have to give of Egypt in general and\r\nsummarily. I shall now describe the separate parts of the country and\r\ntheir advantages.\r\n\r\n6. As Alexandreia and its neighbourhood occupy the greatest and\r\nprincipal portion of the description, I shall begin with it.\r\n\r\nIn sailing towards the west, the sea-coast from Pelusium to the Canobic\r\nmouth of the Nile is about 1300 stadia in extent, and constitutes, as we\r\nhave said, the base of the Delta. Thence to the island Pharos are 150\r\nstadia more.\r\n\r\nPharos is a small oblong island, and lies quite close to the continent,\r\nforming towards it a harbour with a double entrance. For the coast\r\nabounds with bays, and has two promontories projecting into the sea. The\r\nisland is situated between these, and shuts in the bay, lying lengthways\r\nin front of it.\r\n\r\nOf the extremities of the Pharos, the eastern is nearest to the\r\ncontinent and to the promontory in that direction, called Lochias, which\r\nis the cause of the entrance to the port being narrow. Besides the\r\nnarrowness of the passage, there are rocks, some under water, others\r\nrising above it, which at all times increase the violence of the waves\r\nrolling in upon them from the open sea. This extremity itself of the\r\nisland is a rock, washed by the sea on all sides, with a tower upon it\r\nof the same name as the island, admirably constructed of white marble,\r\nwith several stories. Sostratus of Cnidus, a friend of the kings,\r\nerected it for the safety of mariners, as the inscription imports.[806]\r\nFor as the coast on each side is low and without harbours, with reefs\r\nand shallows, an elevated and conspicuous mark was required to enable\r\nnavigators coming in from the open sea to direct their course exactly to\r\nthe entrance of the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe western mouth does not afford an easy entrance, but it does not\r\nrequire the same degree of caution as the other. It forms also another\r\nport, which has the name of Eunostus, or Happy Return: it lies in front\r\nof the artificial and close harbour. That which has its entrance at the\r\nabove-mentioned tower of Pharos is the great harbour. These (two) lie\r\ncontiguous in the recess called Heptastadium, and are separated from it\r\nby a mound. This mound forms a bridge from the continent to the island,\r\nand extends along its western side, leaving two passages only through it\r\nto the harbour of Eunostus, which are bridged over. But this work served\r\nnot only as a bridge, but as an aqueduct also, when the island was\r\ninhabited. Divus Cæsar devastated the island, in his war against the\r\npeople of Alexandreia, when they espoused the party of the kings. A few\r\nsailors live near the tower.\r\n\r\nThe great harbour, in addition to its being well enclosed by the mound\r\nand by nature, is of sufficient depth near the shore to allow the\r\nlargest vessel to anchor near the stairs. It is also divided into\r\nseveral ports.\r\n\r\nThe former kings of Egypt, satisfied with what they possessed, and not\r\ndesirous of foreign commerce, entertained a dislike to all mariners,\r\nespecially the Greeks (who, on account of the poverty of their own\r\ncountry, ravaged and coveted the property of other nations), and\r\nstationed a guard here, who had orders to keep off all persons who\r\napproached. To the guard was assigned as a place of residence the spot\r\ncalled Rhacotis, which is now a part of the city of Alexandreia,\r\nsituated above the arsenal. At that time, however, it was a village. The\r\ncountry about the village was given up to herdsmen, [CAS. 792] who were\r\nalso able (from their numbers) to prevent strangers from entering the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander arrived, and perceived the advantages of the situation,\r\nhe determined to build the city on the (natural) harbour. The prosperity\r\nof the place, which ensued, was intimated, it is said, by a presage\r\nwhich occurred while the plan of the city was tracing. The architects\r\nwere engaged in marking out the line of the wall with chalk, and had\r\nconsumed it all, when the king arrived; upon which the dispensers of\r\nflour supplied the workmen with a part of the flour, which was provided\r\nfor their own use; and this substance was used in tracing the greater\r\npart of the divisions of the streets. This, they said, was a good omen\r\nfor the city.\r\n\r\n7. The advantages of the city are of various kinds. The site is washed\r\nby two seas; on the north, by what is called the Egyptian Sea, and on\r\nthe south, by the sea of the lake Mareia, which is also called Mareotis.\r\nThis lake is filled by many canals from the Nile, both by those above\r\nand those at the sides, through which a greater quantity of merchandise\r\nis imported than by those communicating with the sea. Hence the harbour\r\non the lake is richer than the maritime harbour. The exports by sea from\r\nAlexandreia exceed the imports. This any person may ascertain, either at\r\nAlexandreia or Dicæarchia, by watching the arrival and departure of the\r\nmerchant vessels, and observing how much heavier or lighter their\r\ncargoes are when they depart or when they return.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the wealth derived from merchandise landed at the\r\nharbours on each side, on the sea and on the lake, its fine air is\r\nworthy of remark: this results from the city being on two sides\r\nsurrounded by water, and from the favourable effects of the rise of the\r\nNile. For other cities, situated near lakes, have, during the heats of\r\nsummer, a heavy and suffocating atmosphere, and lakes at their margins\r\nbecome swampy by the evaporation occasioned by the sun’s heat. When a\r\nlarge quantity of moisture is exhaled from swamps, a noxious vapour\r\nrises, and is the cause of pestilential disorders. But at Alexandreia,\r\nat the beginning of summer, the Nile, being full, fills the lake also,\r\nand leaves no marshy matter which is likely to occasion malignant\r\nexhalations. At the same period, the Etesian winds blow from the north,\r\nover a large expanse of sea, and the Alexandrines in consequence pass\r\ntheir summer very pleasantly.\r\n\r\n8. The shape of the site of the city is that of a chlamys or military\r\ncloak. The sides, which determine the length, are surrounded by water,\r\nand are about thirty stadia in extent; but the isthmuses, which\r\ndetermine the breadth of the sides, are each of seven or eight stadia,\r\nbounded on one side by the sea, and on the other by the lake. The whole\r\ncity is intersected by roads for the passage of horsemen and chariots.\r\nTwo of these are very broad, exceeding a plethrum in breadth, and cut\r\none another at right angles. It contains also very beautiful public\r\ngrounds and royal palaces, which occupy a fourth or even a third part of\r\nits whole extent. For as each of the kings was desirous of adding some\r\nembellishment to the places dedicated to the public use, so, besides the\r\nbuildings already existing, each of them erected a building at his own\r\nexpense; hence the expression of the poet may be here applied,\r\n\r\n   “one after the other springs.”[807]\r\n\r\nAll the buildings are connected with one another and with the harbour,\r\nand those also which are beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe Museum is a part of the palaces. It has a public walk and a place\r\nfurnished with seats, and a large hall, in which the men of learning,\r\nwho belong to the Museum, take their common meal. This community\r\npossesses also property in common; and a priest, formerly appointed by\r\nthe kings, but at present by Cæsar, presides over the Museum.\r\n\r\nA part belonging to the palaces consists of that called Sema, an\r\nenclosure, which contained the tombs of the kings and that of Alexander\r\n(the Great). For Ptolemy the son of Lagus took away the body of\r\nAlexander from Perdiccas, as he was conveying it down from Babylon; for\r\nPerdiccas had turned out of his road towards Egypt, incited by ambition\r\nand a desire of making himself master of the country. When Ptolemy had\r\nattacked [and made him prisoner], he intended to [spare his life and]\r\nconfine him in a desert island, but he met with a miserable end at the\r\nhand of his own soldiers, who rushed upon and despatched him by\r\ntransfixing him with the long Macedonian spears. The kings who were with\r\nhim, Aridæus, and the children of Alexander, and Roxana his wife,\r\ndeparted to Macedonia. Ptolemy carried away the body [CAS. 794] of\r\nAlexander, and deposited it at Alexandreia in the place where it now\r\nlies; not indeed in the same coffin, for the present one is of hyalus\r\n(alabaster?) whereas Ptolemy had deposited it in one of gold: it was\r\nplundered by Ptolemy surnamed Cocce’s son and Pareisactus, who came from\r\nSyria and was quickly deposed, so that his plunder was of no service to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n9. In the great harbour at the entrance, on the right hand, are the\r\nisland and the Pharos tower; on the left are the reef of rocks and the\r\npromontory Lochias, with a palace upon it: at the entrance, on the left\r\nhand, are the inner palaces, which are continuous with those on the\r\nLochias, and contain numerous painted apartments and groves. Below lies\r\nthe artificial and close harbour, appropriated to the use of the kings;\r\nand Antirrhodus a small island, facing the artificial harbour, with a\r\npalace on it, and a small port. It was called Antirrhodus, a rival as it\r\nwere of Rhodes.\r\n\r\nAbove this is the theatre, then the Poseidium, a kind of elbow\r\nprojecting from the Emporium, as it is called, with a temple of Neptune\r\nupon it. To this Antony added a mound, projecting still further into the\r\nmiddle of the harbour, and built at the extremity a royal mansion, which\r\nhe called Timonium. This was his last act, when, deserted by his\r\npartisans, he retired to Alexandreia after his defeat at Actium, and\r\nintended, being forsaken by so many friends, to lead the [solitary] life\r\nof Timon for the rest of his days.\r\n\r\nNext are the Cæsarium, the Emporium, and the Apostaseis, or magazines:\r\nthese are followed by docks, extending to the Heptastadium. This is the\r\ndescription of the great harbour.\r\n\r\n10. Next after the Heptastadium is the harbour of Eunostus, and above\r\nthis the artificial harbour, called Cibotus (or the Ark), which also has\r\ndocks. At the bottom of this harbour is a navigable canal, extending to\r\nthe lake Mareotis. Beyond the canal there still remains a small part of\r\nthe city. Then follows the suburb Necropolis, in which are numerous\r\ngardens, burial-places, and buildings for carrying on the process of\r\nembalming the dead.\r\n\r\nOn this side the canal is the Sarapium and other ancient sacred places,\r\nwhich are now abandoned on account of the erection of the temples at\r\nNicopolis; for [there are situated] an amphitheatre and a stadium, and\r\nthere are celebrated quinquennial games; but the ancient and customs\r\nare neglected.\r\n\r\nIn short, the city of Alexandreia abounds with public and sacred\r\nbuildings. The most beautiful of the former is the Gymnasium, with\r\nporticos exceeding a stadium in extent. In the middle of it are the\r\ncourt of justice and groves. Here also is a Paneium, an artificial mound\r\nof the shape of a fircone, resembling a pile of rock, to the top of\r\nwhich there is an ascent by a spiral path. From the summit may be seen\r\nthe whole city lying all around and beneath it.\r\n\r\nThe wide street extends in length along the Gymnasium from the\r\nNecropolis to the Canobic gate. Next is the Hippodromos (or\r\nrace-course), as it is called, and other buildings[808] near it, and\r\nreaching to the Canobic canal. After passing through the Hippodromos is\r\nthe Nicopolis, which contains buildings fronting the sea not less\r\nnumerous than a city. It is 30 stadia distant from Alexandreia. Augustus\r\nCæsar distinguished this place, because it was here that he defeated\r\nAntony and his party of adherents. He took the city at the first onset,\r\nand compelled Antony to put himself to death, but Cleopatra to surrender\r\nherself alive. A short time afterwards, however, she also put an end to\r\nher life secretly, in prison, by the bite of an asp, or (for there are\r\ntwo accounts) by the application of a poisonous ointment. Thus the\r\nempire of the Lagidæ, which had subsisted many years, was dissolved.\r\n\r\n11. Alexander was succeeded by Ptolemy the son of Lagus, the son of\r\nLagus by Philadelphus, Philadelphus by Euergetes; next succeeded\r\nPhilopator the lover[809] of Agathocleia, then Epiphanes, afterwards\r\nPhilometor, the son (thus far) always succeeding the father. But\r\nPhilometor was succeeded by his brother, the second Euergetes, who was\r\nalso called Physcon. He was succeeded by Ptolemy surnamed Lathurus,\r\nLathurus by Auletes of our time, who was the father of Cleopatra. All\r\nthese kings, after the third Ptolemy, were corrupted by luxury and\r\neffeminacy, and the affairs of government were very badly administered\r\nby them; but worst of all by the fourth, the seventh, and the last\r\n(Ptolemy), Auletes (or the Piper), [CAS. 796] who, besides other deeds\r\nof shamelessness, acted the piper; indeed he gloried so much in the\r\npractice, that he scrupled not to appoint trials of skill in his palace;\r\non which occasions he presented himself as a competitor with other\r\nrivals. He was deposed by the Alexandrines; and of his three daughters,\r\none, the eldest, who was legitimate, they proclaimed queen; but his two\r\nsons, who were infants, were absolutely excluded from the succession.\r\n\r\nAs a husband for the daughter established on the throne, the\r\nAlexandrines invited one Cybiosactes from Syria, who pretended to be\r\ndescended from the Syrian kings. The queen after a few days, unable to\r\nendure his coarseness and vulgarity, rid herself of him by causing him\r\nto be strangled. She afterwards married Archelaus, who also pretended to\r\nbe the son of Mithridates Eupator, but he was really the son of that\r\nArchelaus[810] who carried on war against Sylla, and was afterwards\r\nhonourably treated by the Romans. He was grandfather of the last king of\r\nCappadocia in our time, and priest of Comana in Pontus.[811] He was then\r\n(at the time we are speaking of) the guest of Gabinius, and intended to\r\naccompany him in an expedition against the Parthians,[812] but unknown\r\nto Gabinius, he was conducted away by some (friends) to the queen, and\r\ndeclared king.\r\n\r\nAt this time Pompey the Great entertained Auletes as his guest on his\r\narrival at Rome, and recommended him to the senate, negotiated his\r\nreturn, and contrived the execution of most of the deputies, in number a\r\nhundred, who had undertaken to appear against him: at their head was\r\nDion the academic philosopher.\r\n\r\nPtolemy (Auletes) on being restored by Gabinius, put to death both\r\nArchelaus and his daughter;[813] but not long after[814] he was\r\nreinstated in his kingdom, he died a natural death, leaving two sons and\r\ntwo daughters, the eldest of whom was Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nThe Alexandrines declared as sovereigns the eldest son and Cleopatra.\r\nBut the adherents of the son excited a sedition, and banished\r\nCleopatra, who retired with her sister into Syria.[815]\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Pompey the Great, in his flight from\r\nPalæpharsalus,[816] came to Pelusium and Mount Casium. He was\r\ntreacherously slain by the king’s party. When Cæsar arrived, he put the\r\nyoung prince to death, and sending for Cleopatra from her place of\r\nexile, appointed her queen of Egypt, declaring also her surviving\r\nbrother, who was very young, and herself joint sovereigns.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Cæsar and the battle at Pharsalia, Antony passed over\r\ninto Asia; he raised Cleopatra to the highest dignity, made her his\r\nwife, and had children by her. He was present with her at the battle of\r\nActium, and accompanied her in her flight. Augustus Cæsar pursued them,\r\nput an end to their power, and rescued Egypt from misgovernment and\r\nrevelry.\r\n\r\n12. At present Egypt is a (Roman) province, pays considerable tribute,\r\nand is well governed by prudent persons, who are sent there in\r\nsuccession. The governor thus sent out has the rank of king. Subordinate\r\nto him is the administrator of justice, who is the supreme judge in many\r\ncauses. There is another officer, who is called Idiologus, whose\r\nbusiness it is to inquire into property for which there is no claimant,\r\nand which of right falls to Cæsar. These are accompanied by Cæsar’s\r\nfreedmen and stewards, who are intrusted with affairs of more or less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThree legions are stationed in Egypt, one in the city, the rest in the\r\ncountry. Besides these there are also nine Roman cohorts, three\r\nquartered in the city, three on the borders of Ethiopia in Syene, as a\r\nguard to that tract, and three in other parts of the country. There are\r\nalso three bodies of cavalry distributed in convenient posts.\r\n\r\nOf the native magistrates in the cities, the first is the expounder of\r\nthe law, who is dressed in scarlet; he receives the customary honours of\r\nthe country, and has the care of providing what is necessary for the\r\ncity. The second is the writer of records, the third is the chief judge.\r\nThe fourth is the commander of the night guard. These magistrates\r\nexisted in the time of the kings, but in consequence of the bad\r\nadministration of affairs by the latter, the prosperity of the city was\r\nruined by [CAS. 797] licentiousness. Polybius expresses his indignation\r\nat the state of things when he was there: he describes the inhabitants\r\nof the city to be composed of three classes; the (first) Egyptians and\r\nnatives, acute but indifferent citizens, and meddling with civil\r\naffairs. The second, the mercenaries, a numerous and undisciplined body;\r\nfor it was an ancient custom to maintain foreign soldiers, who, from the\r\nworthlessness of their sovereigns, knew better how to govern than to\r\nobey. The third were the Alexandrines, who, for the same reason, were\r\nnot orderly citizens;[817] but still they were better than the\r\nmercenaries, for although they were a mixed race, yet being of Greek\r\norigin, they retained the customs common to the Greeks. But this class\r\nwas extinct nearly about the time of Euergetes Physcon, in whose reign\r\nPolybius came to Alexandreia. For Physcon, being distressed by factions,\r\nfrequently exposed the multitude to the attacks of the soldiery, and\r\nthus destroyed them. By such a state of things in the city the words of\r\nthe poet (says Polybius) were verified:\r\n\r\n   “The way to Egypt is long and vexatious.”[818]\r\n\r\n13. Such then, if not worse, was the condition of the city under the\r\nlast kings. The Romans, as far as they were able, corrected, as I have\r\nsaid, many abuses, and established an orderly government, by appointing\r\nvice-governors, nomarchs, and ethnarchs, whose business it was to\r\nsuperintend affairs of minor importance.\r\n\r\nThe greatest advantage which the city possesses arises from its being\r\nthe only place in all Egypt well situated by nature for communication\r\nwith the sea by its excellent harbour, and with the land by the river,\r\nby means of which everything is easily transported and collected\r\ntogether into this city, which is the greatest mart in the habitable\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThese may be said to be the superior excellencies of the city. Cicero,\r\nin one of his orations,[819] in speaking of the revenues of Egypt,\r\nstates that an annual tribute of 12,500 talents was paid to (Ptolemy)\r\nAuletes, the father of Cleopatra. If then a king, who administered his\r\ngovernment in the worst possible manner, and with the greatest\r\nnegligence, obtained so large a revenue, what must we suppose it to be\r\nat present, when affairs are administered with great care, and when the\r\ncommerce with India and with Troglodytica has been so greatly increased?\r\nFor formerly not even twenty vessels ventured to navigate the Arabian\r\nGulf, or advance to the smallest distance beyond the straits at its\r\nmouth; but now large fleets are despatched as far as India and the\r\nextremities of Ethiopia, from which places the most valuable freights\r\nare brought to Egypt, and are thence exported to other parts, so that a\r\ndouble amount of custom is collected, arising from imports on the one\r\nhand, and from exports on the other. The most expensive description of\r\ngoods is charged with the heaviest impost; for in fact Alexandreia has a\r\nmonopoly of trade, and is almost the only receptacle for this kind of\r\nmerchandise and place of supply for foreigners. The natural convenience\r\nof the situation is still more apparent to persons travelling through\r\nthe country, and particularly along the coast which commences at the\r\nCatabathmus; for to this place Egypt extends.\r\n\r\nNext to it is Cyrenæa, and the neighbouring barbarians, the Marmaridæ.\r\n\r\n14. From the Catabathmus[820] to Parætonium is a run of 900 stadia for a\r\nvessel in a direct course. There is a city and a large harbour of about\r\n40 stadia in extent, by some called the city Parætonium,[821] by others,\r\nAmmonia. Between these is the village of the Egyptians, and the\r\npromontory Ænesisphyra, and the Tyndareian rocks, four small islands,\r\nwith a harbour; then Drepanum a promontory, and Ænesippeia an island\r\nwith a harbour, and Apis a village, from which to Parætonium are 100\r\nstadia; [from thence] to the temple of Ammon is a journey of five days.\r\nFrom Parætonium to Alexandreia are about 1300 stadia. Between these are,\r\nfirst, a promontory of white earth, called Leuce-Acte, then Phœnicus a\r\nharbour, and Pnigeus a village; after these the island Sidonia\r\n(Pedonia?) with a harbour; then a little further off from the sea,\r\nAntiphræ. The whole of this country produces no wine of a good quality,\r\nand the earthen jars contain more sea-water than wine, which is called\r\nLibyan;[822] this and beer are the [CAS. 799] principal beverage of the\r\ncommon people of Alexandria. Antiphræ in particular was a subject of\r\nridicule (on account of its bad wine).\r\n\r\nNext is the harbour Derrhis,[823] which has its name from an adjacent\r\nblack rock, resembling δέῤῥις, a hide. The neighbouring place is called\r\nZephyrium. Then follows another harbour, Leucaspis (the white shield),\r\nand many others; then the Cynossema (or dog’s monument); then\r\nTaposeiris, not that situated upon the sea; here is held a great public\r\nfestival. There is another Taposeiris,[824] situated at a considerable\r\ndistance beyond the city (Alexandreia). Near this, and close to the sea,\r\nis a rocky spot, which is the resort of great numbers of people at all\r\nseasons of the year, for the purpose of feasting and amusement. Next is\r\nPlinthine,[825] and the village of Nicium, and Cherronesus a fortress,\r\ndistant from Alexandreia and the Necropolis about 70 stadia.\r\n\r\nThe lake Mareia, which extends as far as this place, is more than 150\r\nstadia in breadth, and in length less than 300 stadia. It contains eight\r\nislands. The whole country about it is well inhabited. Good wine also is\r\nproduced here, and in such quantity that the Mareotic wine is racked in\r\norder that it may be kept to be old.[826]\r\n\r\n15. The byblus[827] and the Egyptian bean grow in the marshes and lakes;\r\nfrom the latter the ciborium is made.[828] The stalks of the bean are\r\nnearly of equal height, and grow to the length of ten feet. The byblus\r\nis a bare stem, with a tuft on the top. But the bean puts out leaves and\r\nflowers in many parts, and bears a fruit similar to our bean, differing\r\nonly in size and taste. The bean-grounds present an agreeable sight, and\r\nafford amusement to those who are disposed to recreate themselves with\r\nconvivial feasts. These entertainments take place in boats with cabins;\r\nthey enter the thickest part of the plantation, where they are\r\novershadowed with the leaves, which are very large, and serve for\r\ndrinking-cups and dishes, having a hollow which fits them for the\r\npurpose. They are found in great abundance in the shops in Alexandreia,\r\nwhere they are used as vessels. One of the sources of land revenue is\r\nthe sale of these leaves. Such then is the nature of this bean.\r\n\r\nThe byblus does not grow here in great abundance, for it is not\r\ncultivated. But it abounds in the lower parts of the Delta. There is one\r\nsort inferior to the other.[829] The best is the hieratica. Some persons\r\nintending to augment the revenue, employed in this case a method which\r\nthe Jews practised with the palm, especially the caryotic, and with the\r\nbalsamum.[830] In many places it is not allowed to be cultivated, and\r\nthe price is enhanced by its rarity: the revenue is indeed thus\r\nincreased, but the general consumption [of the article] is injured.\r\n\r\n16. On passing through the Canobic gate of the city, on the right hand\r\nis the canal leading to Canobus, close to the lake. They sail by this\r\ncanal to Schedia, to the great river, and to Canobus, but the first\r\nplace at which they arrive is Eleusis. This is a settlement near\r\nAlexandreia and Nicopolis, and situated on the Canobic canal. It has\r\nhouses of entertainment which command beautiful views, and hither [CAS.\r\n800] resort men and women who are inclined to indulge in noisy revelry,\r\na prelude to Canobic life, and the dissolute manners of the people of\r\nCanobus.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from Eleusis, on the right hand, is the canal\r\nleading towards Schedia. Schedia is distant four schœni from\r\nAlexandreia. It is a suburb of the city, and has a station for the\r\nvessels with cabins, which convey the governors when they visit the\r\nupper parts of the country. Here is collected the duty on merchandise,\r\nas it is transported up or down the river. For this purpose a bridge of\r\nboats is laid across the river, and from this kind of bridge the place\r\nhas the name of Schedia.\r\n\r\nNext after the canal leading to Schedia, the navigation thence to\r\nCanobus is parallel to the sea-coast, extending from Pharos to the\r\nCanobic mouth. For between the sea and the canal, is a narrow band of\r\nground, on which is situated the smaller Taposeiris, which lies next\r\nafter Nicopolis, and Zephyrium a promontory, on which is a small temple\r\ndedicated to Venus Arsinoë.\r\n\r\nAnciently, it is said, a city called Thonis stood there, which bears the\r\nname of the king, who entertained as his guests Menelaus and Helen. The\r\npoet thus speaks of the drugs which were given to Helen,\r\n\r\n   “the potent drugs, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, gave\r\n   to Helen.”\r\n\r\n17. Canobus is a city, distant by land from Alexandreia 120 stadia. It\r\nhas its name from Canobus, the pilot of Menelaus, who died there. It\r\ncontains the temple of Sarapis, held in great veneration, and celebrated\r\nfor the cure of diseases; persons even of the highest rank confide in\r\nthem, and sleep there themselves on their own account, or others for\r\nthem. Some persons record the cures, and others the veracity of the\r\noracles which are delivered there. But remarkable above everything else\r\nis the multitude of persons who resort to the public festivals, and come\r\nfrom Alexandreia by the canal. For day and night there are crowds of men\r\nand women in boats, singing and dancing, without restraint, and with the\r\nutmost licentiousness. Others, at Canobus itself, keep hostelries\r\nsituated on the banks of the canal, which are well adapted for such kind\r\nof diversion and revelry.\r\n\r\n18. Next to Canobus is Heracleium, in which is a temple of Hercules;\r\nthen follows the Canobic mouth,[832] and the commencement of the Delta.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the Canobic canal is the Menelaïte Nome, so called from\r\nthe brother of the first Ptolemy, but certainly not from the hero\r\n(Menelaus), as some writers assert, among whom is Artemidorus.\r\n\r\nNext to the Canobic mouth is the Bolbitine, then the Sebennytic, and the\r\nPhatnitic, which is the third in magnitude compared with the first two,\r\nwhich form the boundaries of the Delta. For it branches off into the\r\ninterior, not far from the vertex of the Delta. The Mendesian is very\r\nnear the Phatnitic mouth; next is the Tanitic, and lastly the Pelusiac\r\nmouth. There are others, which are of little consequence, between these,\r\nsince they are as it were false mouths.\r\n\r\nThe mouths have entrances which are not capable of admitting large\r\nvessels, but lighters only, on account of the shallows and marshes. The\r\nCanobic mart is principally used as a mart for merchandise, the harbours\r\nat Alexandreia being closed, as I have said before.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bolbitine mouth there runs out to a great distance a low and\r\nsandy promontory. It is called Agnu-ceras (or Willow Point). Then\r\nfollows the watch-tower of Perseus,[833] and the fortress of the\r\nMilesians. For in the time of Psammitichus, and when Cyaxares was king\r\nof the Medes, some Milesians with 30 vessels steered into the Bolbitine\r\nmouth, disembarked there, and built the above-mentioned fortress. Some\r\ntime afterwards they sailed up to the Saïtic Nome, and having conquered\r\nInarus in an engagement at sea, founded the city Naucratis, not far\r\nabove Schedia.\r\n\r\nNext after the fortress of the Milesians, in proceeding towards the\r\nSebennytic mouth, are lakes, one of which is called Butice, from the\r\ncity Butus; then the city Sebennytice and Sais, the capital of the lower\r\ncountry; here Minerva is worshipped. In the temple there of this\r\ngoddess, is the tomb of Psammitichus. Near Butus is Hermopolis, situated\r\nin an island, and at Butus is an oracle of Latona.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 802] 19. In the interior above the Sebennytic and Phatnitic mouths\r\nis Xoïs, both an island and a city in the Sebennytic Nome. There are\r\nalso Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, where Pan[834] is worshipped,\r\nand of animals a goat. Here, according to Pindar, goats have intercourse\r\nwith women.\r\n\r\nNear Mendes are Diospolis, and the lakes about it, and Leontopolis; then\r\nfurther on, the city Busiris,[835] in the Busirite Nome, and Cynospolis.\r\n\r\nEratosthenes says, “That to repel strangers is a practice common to all\r\nbarbarians, but that this charge against the Egyptians is derived from\r\nfabulous stories related of (one) Busiris and his people in the Busirite\r\nNome, as some persons in later times were disposed to charge the\r\ninhabitants of this place with inhospitality, although in truth there\r\nwas neither king nor tyrant of the name of Busiris: that besides there\r\nwas a common saying,\r\n\r\n   ‘The way to Egypt is long and vexatious,’[836]\r\n\r\nwhich originated in the want of harbours, and in the state of the\r\nharbour at Pharos, which was not of free access, but watched and guarded\r\nby herdsmen, who were robbers, and attacked those who attempted to sail\r\ninto it. The Carthaginians drown [he says] any strangers who sail past,\r\non their voyage to Sardinia or to the Pillars. Hence much of what is\r\nrelated of the parts towards the west is discredited. The Persians also\r\nwere treacherous guides, and conducted the ambassadors along circuitous\r\nand difficult ways.”\r\n\r\n20. Contiguous to the Busirite Nome are the Athribite Nome and the city\r\nAthribis; next the Prosopite Nome, in which latter is Aphroditopolis\r\n(the city of Venus). Above the Mendesian and the Tanitic mouths are a\r\nlarge lake, and the Mendesian and Leontopolite Nomes, and a city of\r\nAphrodite (or Venus) and the Pharbetite Nome. Then follows the Tanitic,\r\nwhich some call the Saïtic mouth, and the Tanite Nome,[837] and in it\r\nTanis a large city.\r\n\r\n21. Between the Tanitic and the Pelusiac mouths are lakes and large and\r\ncontinuous marshes, among which are numerous villages. Pelusium itself\r\nhas many marshes lying around it, which some call Barathra (or water\r\nholes), and swamps. It is situated at a distance of more than 20 stadia\r\nfrom the sea. The circumference of the wall is 20 stadia. It has its\r\nname from the mud (πηλοῦ) of the swamps.[838] On this quarter Egypt is\r\ndifficult of access, i. e. from the eastern side towards Phœnicia and\r\nJudæa, and on the side of Arabia Nabatæa, which is contiguous; through\r\nwhich countries the road to Egypt lies.\r\n\r\nThe country between the Nile and the Arabian Gulf is Arabia, and at its\r\nextremity is situated Pelusium. But the whole is desert, and not\r\npassable by an army. The isthmus between Pelusium and the recess of the\r\nArabian Gulf near Heroopolis is 1000 stadia; but, according to\r\nPoseidonius, less than 1500 stadia in extent. Besides its being sandy\r\nand without water, it abounds with reptiles, which burrow in the sand.\r\n\r\n22. In sailing up the river from Schedia to Memphis,[839] on the right\r\nhand, are a great many villages extending as far as the lake Mareia,\r\namong which is that called the village of Chabrias. Upon the river is\r\nHermopolis, then Gynæcopolis, and the Gynæcopolite Nome; next Momemphis\r\nand the Momemphite Nome. Between these places are many canals, which\r\nempty themselves into the lake Mareotis. The Momemphitæ worship Venus,\r\nand a sacred cow is kept there, as Apis is maintained at Memphis, and\r\nMneyis[840] at Heliopolis. [CAS. 803] These animals are regarded as\r\ngods, but there are other places, and these are numerous, both in the\r\nDelta and beyond it, in which a bull or a cow is maintained, which are\r\nnot regarded as gods, but only as sacred.\r\n\r\n23. Above Momemphis are two nitre mines, which furnish nitre in large\r\nquantities, and the Nitriote Nome. Here Sarapis is worshipped, and they\r\nare the only people in Egypt who sacrifice a sheep. In this nome and\r\nnear this place is a city called Menelaus. On the left hand in the\r\nDelta, upon the river, is Naucratis. At the distance of two schœni from\r\nthe river is Saïs,[841] and a little above it the asylum of Osiris, in\r\nwhich it is said Osiris is buried. This, however, is questioned by many\r\npersons, and particularly by the inhabitants of Philæ, which is situated\r\nabove Syene and Elephantina. These people tell this tale, that Isis\r\nplaced coffins of Osiris in various places, but that one only contained\r\nthe body of Osiris, so that no one knew which of them it was; and that\r\nshe did this with the intention of concealing it from Typhon,[842] who\r\nmight come and cast the body out of its place of deposit.\r\n\r\n24. This is the description of the country from Alexandreia to the\r\nvertex of the Delta.\r\n\r\nArtemidorus says, that the navigation up the river is 28 schœni, which\r\namount to 840 stadia, reckoning the schœnus at 30 stadia. When we\r\nourselves sailed up the river, schœni of different measures were used at\r\ndifferent places in giving the distances, so that sometimes the received\r\nschœnus was a measure of 40 stadia and even more. That the measure of\r\nthe schœnus was unsettled among the Egyptians, Artemidorus himself shows\r\nin a subsequent place. In reckoning the distance from Memphis to\r\nThebaïs, he says that each schœnus consists of 120 stadia, and from the\r\nThebaïs to Syene of 60 stadia. In sailing up from Pelusium to the same\r\nvertex of the Delta, is a distance, he says, of 25 schœni, or 750\r\nstadia, and he employs the same measure.\r\n\r\nOn setting out from Pelusium, the first canal met with is that which\r\nfills the lakes, “near the marshes,” as they are called. There are two\r\nof these lakes, situated upon the left hand of the great stream above\r\nPelusium in Arabia. He mentions other lakes also, and canals in the same\r\nparts beyond the Delta.\r\n\r\nThe Sethroïte Nome extends along one of the two lakes. He reckons this\r\nas one of the ten nomes in the Delta. There are two other canals, which\r\ndischarge themselves into the same lakes.\r\n\r\n25. There is another canal also, which empties itself into the Red Sea,\r\nor Arabian Gulf, near the city Arsinoë, which some call Cleopatris.[843]\r\nIt flows through the Bitter Lakes, as [CAS. 804] they are called, which\r\nwere bitter formerly, but when the above-mentioned canal was cut, the\r\nbitter quality was altered by their junction with the river, and at\r\npresent they contain excellent fish, and abound with aquatic birds.\r\n\r\nThe canal was first cut by Sesostris before the Trojan times, but\r\naccording to other writers, by the son of[844] Psammitichus, who only\r\nbegan the work, and afterwards died; lastly, Darius the First succeeded\r\nto the completion of the undertaking, but he desisted from continuing\r\nthe work, when it was nearly finished, influenced by an erroneous\r\nopinion that the level of the Red Sea was higher than Egypt, and that if\r\nthe whole of the intervening isthmus were cut through, the country would\r\nbe overflowed by the sea. The Ptolemaïc kings however did cut through\r\nit, and placed locks upon the canal,[845] so that they sailed, when they\r\npleased, without obstruction into the outer sea, and back again [into\r\nthe canal].\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the surfaces of bodies of water in the first part of\r\nthis work.[846]\r\n\r\n26. Near Arsinoë are situated in the recess of the Arabian Gulf towards\r\nEgypt, Heroopolis and Cleopatris; harbours, suburbs, many canals, and\r\nlakes are also near. There also is the Phagroriopolite Nome, and the\r\ncity Phagroriopolis. The canal, which empties itself into the Red Sea,\r\nbegins at the village Phaccusa, to which the village of Philon is\r\ncontiguous. The canal is 100 cubits broad, and its depth sufficient to\r\nfloat a vessel of large burden. These places are near the apex of the\r\nDelta.\r\n\r\n27. There also are the city Bubastus[847] and the Bubastite Nome, and\r\nabove it the Heliopolite Nome. There too is Heliopolis, situated upon a\r\nlarge mound. It contains a temple of the sun, and the ox Mneyis, which\r\nis kept in a sanctuary, and is regarded by the inhabitants as a god, as\r\nApis is regarded by the people of Memphis. In front of the mound are\r\nlakes, into which the neighbouring canal discharges itself. At present\r\nthe city is entirely deserted. It has an ancient temple constructed\r\nafter the Egyptian manner, bearing many proofs of the madness and\r\nsacrilegious acts of Cambyses, who did very great injury to the temples,\r\npartly by fire, partly by violence, mutilating [in some] cases, and\r\napplying fire [in others]. In this manner he injured the obelisks, two\r\nof which, that were not entirely spoilt, were transported to Rome.[848]\r\nThere are others both here and at Thebes, the present Diospolis, some of\r\nwhich are standing, much corroded by fire, and others lying on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n28. The plan of the temples is as follows.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance into the temenus is a paved floor, in breadth about a\r\nplethrum, or even less; its length is three or four times as great, and\r\nin some instances even more. This part is called Dromos, and is\r\nmentioned by Callimachus,\r\n\r\n   “this is the Dromos, sacred to Anubis.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole length on each side are placed stone sphinxes, at\r\nthe distance of 20 cubits or a little more from each other, so that\r\nthere is one row of sphinxes on the right hand, and another on the left.\r\nNext after the sphinxes is a large propylon, then on proceeding further,\r\nanother propylon, and then another. Neither the number of the propyla\r\nnor of the sphinxes is determined by any rule. They are different in\r\ndifferent temples, as well as the length and breadth of the Dromi.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 805] Next to the propyla is the naos, which has a large and\r\nconsiderable pronaos; the sanctuary in proportion; there is no statue,\r\nat least not in human shape, but a representation of some of the brute\r\nanimals. On each side of the pronaos project what are called the wings.\r\nThese are two walls of equal height with the naos. At first the distance\r\nbetween them is a little more than the breadth of the foundation of the\r\nnaos.[849] As you proceed onwards, the [base] lines incline towards one\r\nanother till they approach within 50 or 60 cubits. These walls have\r\nlarge sculptured figures, very much like the Tyrrhenian (Etruscan) and\r\nvery ancient works among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThere is also a building with a great number of pillars, as at Memphis,\r\nin the barbaric style; for, except the magnitude and number and rows of\r\npillars, there is nothing pleasing nor easily described,[850] but rather\r\na display of labour wasted.\r\n\r\n29. At Heliopolis we saw large buildings in which the priests lived. For\r\nit is said that anciently this was the principal residence of the\r\npriests, who studied philosophy and astronomy. But there are no longer\r\neither such a body of persons or such pursuits. No one was pointed out\r\nto us on the spot, as presiding over these studies, but only persons who\r\nperformed sacred rites, and who explained to strangers [the\r\npeculiarities of] the temples.\r\n\r\nA person of the name of Chæremon accompanied the governor, Ælius Gallus,\r\nin his journey from Alexandreia into Egypt, and pretended to some\r\nknowledge of this kind, but he was generally ridiculed for his boasting\r\nand ignorance. The houses of the priests, and the residences of Plato\r\nand of Eudoxus, were shown to us. Eudoxus came here with Plato, and,\r\naccording to some writers, lived thirteen years in the society of the\r\npriests. For the latter were distinguished for their knowledge of the\r\nheavenly bodies, but were mysterious and uncommunicative, yet after a\r\ntime were prevailed upon by courtesy to acquaint them with some of the\r\nprinciples of their science, but the barbarians concealed the greater\r\npart of them. They had, however, communicated the knowledge of the\r\nadditional portions of the day and night, in the space of 365 days,\r\nnecessary to complete the annual period; and, at that time, the length\r\nof the year was unknown to the Greeks, as were many other things, until\r\nlater astronomers received them from the persons who translated the\r\nrecords of the priests into the Greek language, and even now derive\r\nknowledge from their writings and from those of the Chaldeans.[851]\r\n\r\n30. After Heliopolis is the “Nile above the Delta.” The country on the\r\nright hand, as you go up the Nile, is called Libya, as well as that near\r\nAlexandreia and the lake Mareotis; the country on the left hand is\r\ncalled Arabia. The territory belonging to Heliopolis is in Arabia, but\r\nthe city Cercesura is in Libya, and situated opposite to the observatory\r\nof Eudoxus. For there is shown an observing station in front of\r\nHeliopolis, as there is in front of Cnidus, where Eudoxus marked certain\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies. This is the Letopolite Nome.\r\n\r\nIn sailing up the river we meet with Babylon, a strong fortress, built\r\nby some Babylonians who had taken refuge there, and had obtained\r\npermission from the kings to establish a settlement in that place. At\r\npresent it is an encampment for one of the three legions which garrison\r\nEgypt. There is a mountainous ridge, which extends from the encampment\r\nas far as the Nile. At this ridge are wheels and screws, by which water\r\nis raised from the river, and one hundred and fifty prisoners are [thus]\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe pyramids on the other side [of the river] at Memphis may be clearly\r\ndiscerned from this place, for they are not far off.\r\n\r\n31. Memphis itself also, the residence of the kings of Egypt, is near,\r\nbeing only three schœni distant from the Delta. It contains temples,\r\namong which is that of Apis, who is the same as Osiris. Here the ox Apis\r\nis kept in a sort of sanctuary, and is held, as I have said, to be a\r\ngod. The forehead and some other small parts of its body are white; the\r\nother parts are black. By these marks the fitness of the successor\r\n[CAS. 807] is always determined, when the animal to which they pay these\r\nhonours dies. In front of the sanctuary is a court, in which there is\r\nanother sanctuary for the dam of Apis. Into this court the Apis is let\r\nloose at times, particularly for the purpose of exhibiting him to\r\nstrangers. He is seen through a door in the sanctuary, and he is\r\npermitted to be seen also out of it. After he has frisked about a little\r\nin the court, he is taken back to his own stall.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Apis is near the Hephæsteium (or temple of Vulcan); the\r\nHephæsteium[852] itself is very sumptuously constructed, both as regards\r\nthe size of the naos and in other respects. In front of the Dromos is a\r\ncolossal figure consisting of a single stone. It is usual to celebrate\r\nbull-fights in this Dromos; the bulls are bred expressly for this\r\npurpose, like horses. They are let loose, and fight with one another,\r\nthe conqueror receiving a prize.\r\n\r\nAt Memphis also there is a temple of Venus, who is accounted a Grecian\r\ndeity. But some say that it is a temple dedicated to Selene, or the\r\nmoon.[853]\r\n\r\n32. There is also a temple of Sarapis, situated in a very sandy spot,\r\nwhere the sand is accumulated in masses by the wind. Some of the\r\nsphinxes which we saw were buried in this sand up to the head, and one\r\nhalf only of others was visible. Hence we may conceive the danger,\r\nshould any one, in his way to the temple, be surprised by a [sand]\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nThe city is large and populous; it ranks next to Alexandreia, and, like\r\nthat place, is inhabited by mixed races of people. There are lakes in\r\nfront of the city and of the palaces, which at present are in ruins and\r\ndeserted. They are situated upon an eminence, and extend as far as the\r\nlower part of the city.\r\n\r\nClose to this place are a grove and a lake.\r\n\r\n33. At the distance of 40 stadia from Memphis is a brow of a hill, on\r\nwhich are many pyramids, the tombs of the kings.[854] Three of them are\r\nconsiderable. Two of these are reckoned among the seven wonders [of the\r\nworld]. They are a stadium in height, and of a quadrangular shape. Their\r\nheight somewhat exceeds the length of each of the sides.[855] One\r\npyramid is a little larger than the other. At a moderate height in one\r\nof the sides[856] is a stone, which may be taken out; when that is\r\nremoved, there is an oblique passage [leading] to the tomb. They are\r\nnear each other, and upon the same level. Farther on, at a greater\r\nheight of the mountain, is the third pyramid, which is much less than\r\nthe two others, but constructed at much greater expense; for from the\r\nfoundation [CAS. 808] nearly as far as the middle, it is built of black\r\nstone. Mortars are made of this stone, which is brought from a great\r\ndistance; for it comes from the mountains of Ethiopia, and being hard\r\nand difficult to be worked, the labour is attended with great expense.\r\nIt is said to be the tomb of a courtesan, built by her lovers, and whose\r\nname, according to Sappho the poetess, was Doriche. She was the mistress\r\nof her brother Charaxus, who traded to the port of Naucratis with wine\r\nof Lesbos. Others call her Rhodopis.[857]\r\n\r\nA story is told of her, that, when she was bathing, an eagle snatched\r\none of her sandals from the hands of her female attendant and carried it\r\nto Memphis; the eagle soaring over the head of the king, who was\r\nadministering justice at the time, let the sandal fall into his lap. The\r\nking, struck with the shape of the sandal, and the singularity of the\r\naccident, [CAS. 808] sent over the country to discover the woman to\r\nwhom it belonged. She was found in the city of Naucratis, and brought to\r\nthe king, who made her his wife. At her death she was honoured with the\r\nabove-mentioned tomb.\r\n\r\n34. One extraordinary thing which I saw at the pyramids must not be\r\nomitted. Heaps of stones from the quarries lie in front of the pyramids.\r\nAmong these are found pieces which in shape and size resemble\r\nlentils.[858] Some contain substances like grains half peeled. These, it\r\nis said, are the remnants of the workmen’s food converted into stone;\r\nwhich is not probable.[859] For at home in our country (Amasia), there\r\nis a long hill in a plain, which abounds with pebbles of a porus\r\nstone,[860] resembling lentils. The pebbles of the sea-shore and of\r\nrivers suggest somewhat of the same difficulty [respecting their\r\norigin]; some explanation may indeed be found in the motion [to which\r\nthese are subject] in flowing waters, but the investigation of the above\r\nfact presents more difficulty. I have said elsewhere,[861] that in sight\r\nof the pyramids, on the other side in Arabia, and near the stone\r\nquarries from which they are built, is a very rocky mountain, called the\r\nTrojan mountain; beneath it there are caves, and near the caves and the\r\nriver a village called Troy, an ancient settlement of the captive\r\nTrojans who had accompanied Menelaus and settled there.[862]\r\n\r\n35. Next to Memphis is the city Acanthus, situated also in Libya, and\r\nthe temple of Osiris, and the grove of the Thebaïc acantha, from which\r\ngum is procured. Next is the Aphroditopolite Nome, and the city in\r\nArabia of the same name, where is kept a white cow, considered sacred.\r\nThen follows the Heracleote Nome, in a large island, near which is the\r\ncanal on the right hand, which leads into Libya, in the direction of the\r\nArsinoïte Nome; so that the canal has two entrances, a part of the\r\nisland on one side being interposed between them.[863] This nome is the\r\nmost considerable of all in appearance, natural properties, and\r\nembellishment. It is the only nome planted with large, full-grown olive\r\ntrees, which bear fine fruit. If the produce were carefully collected,\r\ngood oil might be obtained; but this care is neglected, and although a\r\nlarge quantity of oil is obtained, yet it has a disagreeable smell. (The\r\nrest of Egypt is without the olive tree, except the gardens near\r\nAlexandreia, which are planted with olive trees, but do not furnish any\r\noil.) It produces wine in abundance, corn, pulse, and a great variety of\r\nother grains. It has also the remarkable lake Mœris, which in extent is\r\na sea, and the colour of its waters resembles that of the sea. Its\r\nborders also are like the sea-shore, so that we may make the same\r\nsuppositions respecting these as about the country near Ammon. For they\r\nare not very far distant from one another and from Parætonium; and we\r\nmay conjecture from a multitude of proofs, that as the temple of Ammon\r\nwas once situated upon the sea, so this tract of country also bordered\r\non the sea at some former period. But Lower Egypt and the country as far\r\nas the Lake Sirbonis were sea, and confluent perhaps [CAS. 809] with\r\nthe Red Sea at Heroopolis, and the Ælanitic recess of the gulf.\r\n\r\n36. We have treated these subjects at length in the First Book of the\r\nGeography. At present we shall make a few remarks on the operations of\r\nnature and of Providence conjointly.—On the operations of nature, that\r\nall things converge to a point, namely, the centre of the whole, and\r\nassume a spherical shape around it. The earth is the densest body, and\r\nnearer the centre than all others: the less dense and next to it is\r\nwater; but both land and water are spheres, the first solid, the second\r\nhollow, containing the earth within it.—On the operations of Providence,\r\nthat it has exercised a will, is disposed to variety, and is the\r\nartificer of innumerable works. In the first rank, as greatly surpassing\r\nall the rest, is the generation of animals, of which the most excellent\r\nare gods and men, for whose sake the rest were formed. To the gods\r\nProvidence assigned heaven; and the earth to men, the extreme parts of\r\nthe world; for the extreme parts of the sphere are the centre and the\r\ncircumference. But since water encompasses the earth, and man is not an\r\naquatic, but a land-animal, living in the air, and requiring much light,\r\nProvidence formed many eminences and cavities in the earth, so that\r\nthese cavities should receive the whole or a great part of the water\r\nwhich covers the land beneath it; and that the eminences should rise and\r\nconceal the water beneath them, except so much as was necessary for the\r\nuse of the human race, the animals and plants about it.\r\n\r\nBut as all things are in constant motion, and undergo great changes,\r\n(for it is not possible that things of such a nature, so numerous and\r\nvast, could be otherwise regulated in the world,) we must not suppose\r\nthe earth or the water always to continue in this state, so as to retain\r\nperpetually the same bulk, without increase or diminution, or that each\r\npreserves the same fixed place, particularly as the reciprocal change of\r\none into the other is most consonant to nature from their proximity; but\r\nthat much of the land is changed into water, and a great portion of\r\nwater becomes land, just as we observe great differences in the earth\r\nitself. For one kind of earth crumbles easily, another is solid and\r\nrocky, and contains iron; and so of others. There is also a variety in\r\nthe quality of water; for some waters are saline, others sweet and\r\npotable, others medicinal, and either salutary or noxious, others cold\r\nor hot. Is it therefore surprising that some parts of the earth which\r\nare now inhabited should formerly have been occupied by sea, and that\r\nwhat are now seas should formerly have been inhabited land? so also\r\nfountains once existing have failed, and others have burst forth; and\r\nsimilarly in the case of rivers and lakes: again, mountains and plains\r\nhave been converted reciprocally one into the other. On this subject I\r\nhave spoken before at length,[864] and now let this be said:\r\n\r\n37. The lake Mœris, by its magnitude and depth, is able to sustain the\r\nsuper-abundance of water which flows into it at the time of the rise of\r\nthe river, without overflowing the inhabited and cultivated parts of the\r\ncountry. On the decrease of the water of the river, it distributes the\r\nexcess by the same canal at each of the mouths; and both the lake and\r\nthe canal preserve a remainder, which is used for irrigation. These are\r\nthe natural and independent properties of the lake, but in addition, on\r\nboth mouths of the canal are placed locks, by which the engineers store\r\nup and distribute the water which enters or issues from the canal.\r\n\r\nWe have here also the Labyrinth, a work equal to the Pyramids, and\r\nadjoining to it the tomb of the king who constructed the Labyrinth.[865]\r\nAfter proceeding beyond the first entrance of the canal about 30 or 40\r\nstadia, there is a table-shaped plain, with a village and a large palace\r\ncomposed of as many palaces as there were formerly nomes. There are an\r\nequal number of aulæ, surrounded by pillars, and contiguous to one\r\nanother, all in one line and forming one building, like a long wall\r\nhaving the aulæ in front of it. The entrances into the aulæ are opposite\r\nto the wall. In front of the entrances there are long and numerous\r\ncovered ways, with winding passages communicating with each other, so\r\nthat no stranger could find his way into the aulæ or out of them without\r\na guide. The (most) surprising circumstance is that the roofs of these\r\ndwellings consist of a single stone each, and that the covered ways\r\nthrough their whole range were roofed in the same manner with single\r\nslabs of stone of extraordinary size, without the intermixture of timber\r\nor of any other material. On ascending the roof,—which is not of great\r\nheight, for it [CAS. 811] consists only of a single story,—there may be\r\nseen a stone-field, thus composed of stones. Descending again and\r\nlooking[866] into the aulæ, these may be seen in a line supported by\r\ntwenty-seven pillars, each consisting of a single stone. The walls also\r\nare constructed of stones not inferior in size to these.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this building, which occupies more than a stadium, is the\r\ntomb, which is a quadrangular pyramid, each side of which is about four\r\nplethra in length, and of equal height. The name of the person buried\r\nthere is Imandes.[867] They built, it is said, this number of aulæ,\r\nbecause it was the custom for all the nomes to assemble there together\r\naccording to their rank, with their own priests and priestesses, for the\r\npurpose of performing sacrifices and making offerings to the gods, and\r\nof administering justice in matters of great importance. Each of the\r\nnomes was conducted to the aula appointed for it.\r\n\r\n38. Sailing along to the distance of 100 stadia, we come to the city\r\nArsinoë, formerly called Crocodilopolis; for the inhabitants of this\r\nnome worship the crocodile. The animal is accounted sacred, and kept\r\napart by himself in a lake; it is tame, and gentle to the priests, and\r\nis called Suchus. It is fed with bread, flesh, and wine, which strangers\r\nwho come to see it always present. Our host, a distinguished person, who\r\nwas our guide in examining what was curious, accompanied us to the lake,\r\nand brought from the supper table a small cake, dressed meat, and a\r\nsmall vessel containing a mixture of honey and milk. We found the animal\r\nlying on the edge of the lake. The priests went up to it; some of them\r\nopened its mouth, another put the cake into it, then the meat, and\r\nafterwards poured down the honey and milk. The animal then leaped into\r\nthe lake, and crossed to the other side. When another stranger arrived\r\nwith his offering, the priests took it, and running round the lake,\r\ncaught the crocodile, and gave him what was brought, in the same manner\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n39. Next after the Arsinoïte and Heracleotic Nomes, is the city of\r\nHercules, in which the ichneumon is worshipped, in opposition to the\r\nArsinoïtes, who worship crocodiles; hence the canal and the lake Mœris\r\nis full of these animals; for they venerate them, and are careful to do\r\nthem no harm: but the Heracleotæ worship the ichneumon, which is most\r\ndestructive both to crocodiles and asps. The ichneumons destroy not only\r\nthe eggs of the latter, but the animals themselves. The ichneumons are\r\nprotected by a covering of mud, in which they roll, and then dry\r\nthemselves in the sun. They then seize the asps by the head or tail, and\r\ndragging them into the river, so kill them.\r\n\r\nThey lie in wait for the crocodiles, when the latter are basking in the\r\nsun with their mouths open; they then drop into their jaws, and eating\r\nthrough their intestines and belly, issue out of the dead body.\r\n\r\n40. Next follows the Cynopolite Nome and Cynopolis, where they worship\r\nthe dog Anubis, and pay certain honours to dogs; a subsistence is there\r\nprovided for them, as sacred animals.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the river is the city Oxyrynchus,[868] and a nome\r\nof the same name. They worship the oxyrynchus, and have a temple\r\ndedicated to this animal; but all the other Egyptians worship the\r\noxyrynchus.[869] For all the Egyptians worship in common certain\r\nanimals; three among the land animals, the ox, the dog, and the cat; two\r\namong the winged tribe, the hawk and the ibis; and two of the aquatic\r\nanimals, the fish lepidotus and the oxyrynchus. There are also other\r\nanimals which each people, independently of others, worship; as the\r\nSaïtæ and Thebaïtæ, a sheep; the Latopolitæ, the latus, a fish\r\ninhabiting the Nile; the people of Lycopolis, a wolf; those of\r\nHermopolis,[870] the cynocephalus; those of Babylon,[871] near Memphis,\r\na cephus, which has the countenance of a satyr, and in other respects is\r\nbetween a dog and a bear; it is bred in Ethiopia. The inhabitants of\r\nThebes worship an eagle; the Leontopolitæ, a lion; the Mendesians, a\r\nmale and female goat; the Athribitæ, a shrew-mouse; different people\r\nworshipping different animals. They do not, however, assign the same\r\nreasons for this difference of worship.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 813] 41. Then follows the Hermopolite Castle, a place where is\r\ncollected the toll on merchandise brought down from the Thebaïs. At this\r\nplace begins the reckoning by schœni of sixty stadia each, which is\r\ncontinued to Syene and Elephantina. Next is the Thebaïc Keep, and a\r\ncanal leading to Tanis. Then follow Lycopolis, Aphroditopolis, and\r\nPanopolis, an old settlement belonging to masons and weavers of linen.\r\n\r\n42. Then follows Ptolemaïs,[872] the largest city in the Thebaïs, not\r\ninferior to Memphis, with a form of government after the Grecian mode.\r\nAbove this city is Abydos, where is the palace of Memnon, constructed in\r\na singular manner, entirely of stone,[873] and after the plan of the\r\nLabyrinth, which we have described, but not composed of many parts. It\r\nhas a fountain situated at a great depth. There is a descent to it\r\nthrough an arched passage built with single stones, of remarkable size\r\nand workmanship.\r\n\r\nThere is a canal which leads to this place from the great river. About\r\nthe canal is a grove of Egyptian acanthus, dedicated to Apollo. Abydos\r\nseems once to have been a large city, second to Thebes. At present it is\r\na small town. But if, as they say, Memnon is called Ismandes by the\r\nEgyptians, the Labyrinth might be a Memnonium, and the work of the same\r\nperson who constructed those at Abydos and at Thebes; for in those\r\nplaces, it is said, are some Memnonia. In the latitude of Abydos is the\r\nfirst Auasis (Oasis) of the three which are said to be in Africa. It is\r\ndistant from Abydos a journey of seven days through a desert. It is an\r\ninhabited place, well supplied with good water and wine, and\r\nsufficiently provided with other articles. The second is that near the\r\nlake Mœris. The third is that at the oracle of Ammon: these are\r\nconsiderable settlements.\r\n\r\n43. Having before spoken at length of the temple of Ammon, we wish to\r\nadd this only, that in ancient times divination in general and oracles\r\nwere held in greater esteem than at present. Now they are greatly\r\nneglected; for the Romans are satisfied with the oracles of the Sibyl,\r\nand with Tyrrhenian divination by the entrails of animals, the flight of\r\nbirds, and portentous appearances. Hence the oracle of Ammon, which was\r\nformerly held in great esteem, is now nearly deserted. This appears\r\nchiefly from the historians who have recorded the actions of Alexander,\r\nadding, indeed, much that has the appearance of flattery, but yet\r\nrelating what is worthy of credit. Callisthenes, for instance, says that\r\nAlexander was ambitious of the glory of visiting the oracle, because he\r\nknew that Perseus and Hercules had before performed the journey thither.\r\nHe set out from Parætonium, although the south winds were blowing, and\r\nsucceeded in his undertaking by vigour and perseverance. When out of his\r\nway on the road, he escaped being overwhelmed in a sand-storm by a fall\r\nof rain, and by the guidance of two crows, which directed his course.\r\nThese things are stated by way of flattery, as also what follows: that\r\nthe priest permitted the king alone to pass into the temple in his usual\r\ndress, whereas the others changed theirs; that all heard the oracles on\r\nthe outside of the temple, except Alexander, who was in the interior of\r\nthe building; that the answers were not given, as at Delphi and at\r\nBranchidæ, in words, but chiefly by nods and signs, as in Homer;\r\n\r\n   “the son of Saturn nodded with his sable brows,”[874]\r\n\r\nthe prophet imitating Jupiter. This, however, the man told the king, in\r\nexpress terms, that he was the son of Jupiter. Callisthenes adds, (after\r\nthe exaggerating style of tragedy,) that when Apollo had deserted the\r\noracle among the Branchidæ, on the temple being plundered by the\r\nBranchidæ (who espoused the party of the Persians in the time of\r\nXerxes,) and the spring had failed, it then reappeared (on the arrival\r\nof Alexander); that the ambassadors also of the Milesians carried back\r\nto Memphis numerous answers of the oracle respecting the descent of\r\nAlexander from Jupiter, and the future victory which he should obtain at\r\nArbela, the death of Darius, and the political changes at Lacedæmon. He\r\nsays also that the Erythræan Athenais, who resembled the ancient\r\nErythræan Sibyl, had declared the high descent of Alexander. Such are\r\nthe accounts of historians.\r\n\r\n44. At Abydos Osiris is worshipped; but in the temple of Osiris no\r\nsinger, nor player on the pipe, nor on the cithara, is permitted to\r\nperform at the commencement of the ceremonies celebrated in honour of\r\nthe god, as is usual in rites celebrated in honour of the other gods.\r\nNext to Abydos is [CAS. 814] the lesser Diospolis,[875] then the city\r\nTentyra,[876] where the crocodile is held in peculiar abhorrence, and is\r\nregarded as the most odious of all animals. For the other Egyptians,\r\nalthough acquainted with its mischievous disposition, and hostility\r\ntowards the human race, yet worship it, and abstain from doing it harm.\r\nBut the people of Tentyra track and destroy it in every way. Some\r\nhowever, as they say of the Psyllians of Cyrenæa, possess a certain\r\nnatural antipathy to snakes, and the people of Tentyra have the same\r\ndislike to crocodiles, yet they suffer no injury from them, but dive and\r\ncross the river when no other person ventures to do so. When crocodiles\r\nwere brought to Rome to be exhibited, they were attended by some of the\r\nTentyritæ. A reservoir was made for them with a sort of stage on one of\r\nthe sides, to form a basking-place for them on coming out of the water,\r\nand these persons went into the water, drew them in a net to the place,\r\nwhere they might sun themselves and be exhibited, and then dragged them\r\nback again to the reservoir. The people of Tentyra worship Venus. At the\r\nback of the fane of Venus is a temple of Isis; then follow what are\r\ncalled the Typhoneia, and the canal leading to Coptos,[877] a city\r\ncommon both to the Egyptians and Arabians.\r\n\r\n45. Then follows the isthmus, extending to the Red Sea near\r\nBerenice,[878] which has no harbour, but good landing-places, because\r\nthe isthmus is conveniently situated. Philadelphus is said to be the\r\nfirst person that opened, by means of his army, this road, which had no\r\nsupply of water, and to have provided stations.[879] This he did because\r\nthe navigation of the Red Sea was difficult, particularly to those who\r\nset out from the recess of the bay. Experience showed the great utility\r\nof this plan, and at present all the Indian, Arabian, and such Ethiopian\r\nmerchandise as is imported by the Arabian Gulf is carried to Coptos,\r\nwhich is the mart for such commodities. Not far from Berenice is Myos\r\nHormus,[880] a city with a naval station for vessels which navigate\r\nthis sea; at no great distance from Coptos is the city of Apollo, so\r\nthat two cities are the boundaries of the isthmus, one on each side. But\r\nat present Coptos and Myos Hormus are in repute, and they are\r\nfrequented.\r\n\r\nFormerly, the camel-merchants travelled in the night, directing their\r\ncourse by observing the stars, and, like mariners, carried with them a\r\nsupply of water. But now watering-places are provided: water is also\r\nobtained by digging to a great depth, and rain-water is found, although\r\nrain rarely falls, which is also collected in reservoirs. It is a\r\njourney of six or seven days.\r\n\r\nOn this isthmus are mines, in which the emeralds and other precious\r\nstones are found by the Arabians, who dig deep subterraneous passages.\r\n\r\n46. Next to the city of Apollo is Thebes, now called Diospolis,\r\n\r\n   “with her hundred gates, through each of which issue two\r\n   hundred men, with horses and chariots,”[881]\r\n\r\naccording to Homer, who mentions also its wealth;\r\n\r\n   “not all the wealth the palaces of Egyptian Thebes\r\n   contain.”[882]\r\n\r\nOther writers use the same language, and consider Thebes as the\r\nmetropolis of Egypt. Vestiges of its magnitude still exist, which extend\r\n80 stadia in length. There are a great number of temples, many of which\r\nCambyses mutilated. The spot is at present occupied by villages. One\r\npart of it, in which is the city, lies in Arabia; another is in the\r\ncountry on the other side of the river, where is the Memnonium. Here are\r\ntwo colossal figures near one another, each consisting of a single\r\nstone. One is entire; the upper parts of the other, from the chair, are\r\nfallen down, the effect, it is said, of an earthquake. It is believed,\r\nthat once a day a noise as of a slight blow issues from the part of the\r\nstatue which remains [CAS. 816] in the seat and on its base. When I was\r\nat those places with Ælius Gallus, and numerous friends and soldiers\r\nabout him, I heard a noise at the first hour (of the day), but whether\r\nproceeding from the base or from the colossus, or produced on purpose by\r\nsome of those standing around the base, I cannot confidently assert. For\r\nfrom the uncertainty of the cause, I am disposed to believe anything\r\nrather than that stones disposed in that manner could send forth sound.\r\n\r\nAbove the Memnonium are tombs of kings in caves, and hewn out of the\r\nstone, about forty in number; they are executed with singular skill, and\r\nare worthy of notice. Among the tombs[883] are obelisks with\r\ninscriptions, denoting the wealth of the kings of that time, and the\r\nextent of their empire, as reaching to the Scythians, Bactrians,\r\nIndians, and the present Ionia; the amount of tribute also, and the\r\nnumber of soldiers, which composed an army of about a million of men.\r\n\r\nThe priests there are said to be, for the most part, astronomers and\r\nphilosophers. The former compute the days, not by the moon, but by the\r\nsun, introducing into the twelve months of thirty days each five days\r\nevery year. But in order to complete the whole year, because there is\r\n(annually) an excess of a part of a day, they form a period from out of\r\nwhole days and whole years, the supernumerary portions of which in that\r\nperiod, when collected together, amount to a day.[884] They ascribe to\r\nMercury all knowledge of this kind. To Jupiter, whom they worship above\r\nall other deities, a virgin of the greatest beauty and of the most\r\nillustrious family (such persons the Greeks call pallades) is dedicated.\r\nShe prostitutes herself with whom she pleases, until the time occurs for\r\nthe natural purification of the body; she is afterwards married; but\r\nbefore her marriage, and after the period of prostitution, they mourn\r\nfor her as for one dead.\r\n\r\n47. Next after Thebes is the city Hermonthis, in which both Apollo and\r\nJupiter are worshipped. They also keep an ox there (for worship).\r\n\r\nNext is the city of Crocodiles, the inhabitants of which worship this\r\nanimal; then Aphroditopolis (the city of Venus),[885] and next to it,\r\nLatopolis, where Minerva is worshipped, and the (fish) Latus; next, the\r\ncity of Eileithyia, and a temple. In the country on the other side of\r\nthe river is Hieraconpolis (the city of hawks), where a hawk is\r\nworshipped; then Apollonopolis, the inhabitants of which are at war with\r\ncrocodiles.\r\n\r\n48. Syene is a city situated on the borders of Ethiopia and Egypt.\r\nElephantina is an island in the Nile, at the distance of half a stadium\r\nin front of Syene; in this island is a city with a temple of Cnuphis,\r\nand a nilometer like that at Memphis. The nilometer is a well upon the\r\nbanks of the Nile, constructed of close-fitting stones, on which are\r\nmarked the greatest, least, and mean risings of the Nile; for the water\r\nin the well and in the river rises and subsides simultaneously. Upon the\r\nwall of the well are lines, which indicate the complete rise of the\r\nriver, and other degrees of its rising. Those [CAS. 817] who examine\r\nthese marks communicate the result to the public for their information.\r\nFor it is known long before, by these marks, and by the time[886]\r\nelapsed from the commencement, what the future rise of the river will\r\nbe, and notice is given of it. This information is of service to the\r\nhusbandmen with reference to the distribution of the water; for the\r\npurpose also of attending to the embankments, canals, and other things\r\nof this kind. It is of use also to the governors, who fix the revenue;\r\nfor the greater the rise of the river, the greater it is expected will\r\nbe the revenue.\r\n\r\nAt Syene there is a well which indicates the summer solstice, because\r\nthese places lie under the tropical circle,[887] [and occasions the\r\ngnomons to cast no shadows at mid-day].[888] For on proceeding from the\r\nplaces in our country, in Greece I mean, towards the south, the sun is\r\nthere first over our head, and occasions the gnomons to be without\r\nshadows at noon. When the sun is vertical to us, it must necessarily\r\ncast its rays down wells, however deep they may be, to the water. For we\r\nourselves stand in a perpendicular position, and wells are dug\r\nperpendicular to the surface.\r\n\r\nHere are stationed three Roman cohorts as a guard.\r\n\r\n49. A little above Elephantine is the lesser cataract, where the boatmen\r\nexhibit a sort of spectacle to the governors.\r\n\r\nThe cataract is in the middle of the river, and is formed by a ridge of\r\nrock, the upper part [or commencement] of which is level, and thus\r\ncapable of receiving the river, but terminating in a precipice, where\r\nthe water dashes down. On each side towards the land there is a stream,\r\nup which is the chief ascent for vessels. The boatmen sail up by this\r\nstream, and, dropping down to the cataract, are impelled with the boat\r\nto the precipice, the crew and the boats escaping unhurt.\r\n\r\nA little above the cataract is Philæ, a common settlement, like\r\nElephantina, of Ethiopians and Egyptians, and equal in size, containing\r\nEgyptian temples, where a bird, which they call hierax, (the hawk,) is\r\nworshipped; but it did not appear to me to resemble in the least the\r\nhawks of our country nor of Egypt, for it was larger, and very different\r\nin the marks of its plumage. They said that the bird was Ethiopian, and\r\nis brought from Ethiopia when its predecessor dies, or before its death.\r\nThe one shown to us when we were there was sick and nearly dead.\r\n\r\n50. We came from Syene to Philæ in a waggon, through a very flat\r\ncountry, a distance of about 100 stadia.[889] Along the whole road on\r\neach side we could see, in many places, very high rocks, round, very\r\nsmooth, and nearly spherical, of black hard stone, of which mortars are\r\nmade: each rested upon a greater stone, and upon this another: they were\r\nlike hermæa.[890] Sometimes these stones consisted of one mass. The\r\nlargest was not less than twelve feet in diameter, and all of them\r\nexceeded this size by one half. We crossed over to the island in a\r\npacton, which is a small boat made of rods, [CAS. 818] whence it\r\nresembles woven-work. Standing then in the water, (at the bottom of the\r\nboat,) or sitting upon some little planks, we easily crossed over, with\r\nsome alarm indeed, but without good cause for it, as there is no danger\r\nif the boat is not overloaded.\r\n\r\n51. Throughout the whole of Egypt, the palm tree is of a bad species,\r\nand produces no good edible fruit in the places about the Delta and\r\nAlexandreia; yet the best kind is found in the Thebaïs. It is a subject\r\nof surprise how countries in the same latitude as Judæa, and bordering\r\nupon the Delta and Alexandreia, should be so different; for Judæa, in\r\naddition to other kinds of date-palms, produces the caryotic, which is\r\nnot inferior to the Babylonian. There are, however, two kinds of dates\r\nin the Thebaïs and in Judæa, the caryotic and another. The Thebaïc is\r\nfirmer, but the flavour is more agreeable. There is an island remarkable\r\nfor producing the best dates, and it also furnishes the largest revenue\r\nto the governors. It was appropriated to the kings, and no private\r\nperson had any share in the produce; at present it belongs to the\r\ngovernors.\r\n\r\n52. Herodotus[891] and other writers trifle very much when they\r\nintroduce into their histories the marvellous, like (an interlude of)\r\nmusic and song, or some melody; for example, in asserting that the\r\nsources of the Nile are near the numerous islands, at Syene and\r\nElephantina, and that at this spot the river has an unfathomable depth.\r\nIn the Nile there are many islands scattered about, some of which are\r\nentirely covered, others in part only, at the time of the rise of the\r\nwaters. The very elevated parts are irrigated by means of screw-pumps.\r\n\r\n53. Egypt was from the first disposed to peace, from having resources\r\nwithin itself, and because it was difficult of access to strangers. It\r\nwas also protected on the north by a harbourless coast and the Egyptian\r\nSea; on the east and west by the desert mountains of Libya and Arabia,\r\nas I have said before.[892] The remaining parts towards the south are\r\noccupied by Troglodytæ, Blemmyes, Nubæ, and Megabari, Ethiopians above\r\nSyene. These are nomades, and not numerous nor warlike, but accounted so\r\nby the ancients, because frequently, like robbers, they attacked\r\ndefenceless persons. Neither are the Ethiopians, who extend towards the\r\nsouth and Meroë, numerous nor collected in a body; for they inhabit a\r\nlong, narrow, and winding tract of land on the river-side, such as we\r\nhave before described; nor are they well prepared either for war or the\r\npursuit of any other mode of life.\r\n\r\nAt present the whole country is in the same pacific state, a proof of\r\nwhich is, that the upper country is sufficiently guarded by three\r\ncohorts, and these not complete. Whenever the Ethiopians have ventured\r\nto attack them, it has been at the risk of danger to their own country.\r\nThe rest of the forces in Egypt are neither very numerous, nor did the\r\nRomans ever once employ them collected into one army. For neither are\r\nthe Egyptians themselves of a warlike disposition, nor the surrounding\r\nnations, although their numbers are very large.\r\n\r\nCornelius Gallus, the first governor of the country appointed by\r\n(Augustus) Cæsar, attacked the city Heroopolis, which had revolted,[893]\r\nand took it with a small body of men. He suppressed also in a short time\r\nan insurrection in the Thebaïs, which originated as to the payment of\r\ntribute. At a later period Petronius resisted, with the soldiers about\r\nhis person, a mob of myriads of Alexandrines, who attacked him by\r\nthrowing stones. He killed some, and compelled the rest to desist.\r\n\r\nWe have before[894] related how Ælius Gallus, when he invaded Arabia\r\nwith a part of the army stationed in Egypt, exhibited a proof of the\r\nunwarlike disposition of the people; and if Syllæus had not betrayed\r\nhim, he would have conquered the whole of Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n54. The Ethiopians, emboldened in consequence of a part of the forces in\r\nEgypt being drawn off by Ælius Gallus, who was engaged in war with the\r\nArabs, invaded the Thebaïs, and attacked the garrison, consisting of\r\nthree cohorts, near Syene; surprised and took Syene, Elephantina, and\r\nPhilæ, by a sudden inroad; enslaved the inhabitants, and threw down the\r\nstatues of Cæsar. But Petronius, marching with less than 10,000 infantry\r\nand 800 horse against an army of 30,000 men, first compelled them to\r\nretreat to Pselchis, an Ethiopian city. He then sent deputies to demand\r\nrestitution of what they had taken, and the reasons which had induced\r\nthem to begin the [CAS. 820] war. On their alleging that they had been\r\nill treated by the nomarchs, he answered, that these were not the\r\nsovereigns of the country, but Cæsar. When they desired three days for\r\nconsideration, and did nothing which they were bound to do, Petronius\r\nattacked and compelled them to fight. They soon fled, being badly\r\ncommanded, and badly armed; for they carried large shields made of raw\r\nhides, and hatchets for offensive weapons; some, however, had pikes, and\r\nothers swords. Part of the insurgents were driven into the city, others\r\nfled into the uninhabited country; and such as ventured upon the passage\r\nof the river escaped to a neighbouring island, where there were not many\r\ncrocodiles on account of the current. Among the fugitives, were the\r\ngenerals of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians in our time, a masculine\r\nwoman, and who had lost an eye. Petronius, pursuing them in rafts and\r\nships, took them all and despatched them immediately to Alexandreia. He\r\nthen attacked Pselchis[895] and took it. If we add the number of those\r\nwho fell in battle to the number of prisoners, few only could have\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nFrom Pselchis Petronius went to Premnis,[896] a strong city, travelling\r\nover the hills of sand, beneath which the army of Cambyses was\r\noverwhelmed by the setting in of a whirlwind. He took the fortress at\r\nthe first onset, and afterwards advanced to Napata.[897] This was the\r\nroyal seat of Candace; and her son was there, but she herself was in a\r\nneighbouring stronghold. When she sent ambassadors to treat of peace,\r\nand to offer the restitution of the prisoners brought from Syene, and\r\nthe statues, Petronius attacked and took Napata, from which her son had\r\nfled, and then razed it. He made prisoners of the inhabitants, and\r\nreturned back again with the booty, as he judged any farther advance\r\ninto the country impracticable on account of the roads. He strengthened,\r\nhowever, the fortifications of Premnis, and having placed a garrison\r\nthere, with two years’ provisions for four hundred men, returned to\r\nAlexandreia. Some of the prisoners were publicly sold as booty, and a\r\nthousand were sent to Cæsar, who had lately returned from the\r\nCantabrians,[898] others died of various diseases.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Candace[899] attacked the garrison with an army of many\r\nthousand men. Petronius came to its assistance, and entering the\r\nfortress before the approach of the enemy, secured the place by many\r\nexpedients. The enemy sent ambassadors, but he ordered them to repair to\r\nCæsar: on their replying, that they did not know who Cæsar was, nor\r\nwhere they were to find him, Petronius appointed persons to conduct them\r\nto his presence. They arrived at Samos, where Cæsar was at that time,\r\nand from whence he was on the point of proceeding into Syria, having\r\nalready despatched Tiberius into Armenia. The ambassadors obtained all\r\nthat they desired, and Cæsar even remitted the tribute which he had\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the preceding part[900] of this work we have spoken at length of\r\nEthiopia, so that its description may be said to be included in that of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nIn general, then, the extreme parts of the habitable world adjacent to\r\nthe intemperate region, which is not habitable by reason either of heat\r\nor cold, must necessarily be defective and inferior, in respect to\r\nphysical advantages, to the temperate [CAS. 821] region. This is\r\nevident from the mode of life of the inhabitants, and their want of what\r\nis requisite for the use and subsistence of man. For the mode of life\r\n[of the Ethiopians] is wretched; they are for the most part naked, and\r\nwander from place to place with their flocks. Their flocks and herds are\r\nsmall in size, whether sheep, goats, or oxen; the dogs also, though\r\nfierce and quarrelsome, are small.[901] It was perhaps from the\r\ndiminutive size of these people, that the story of the Pygmies\r\noriginated, whom no person, worthy of credit has asserted that he\r\nhimself has seen.\r\n\r\n2. They live on millet and barley, from which also a drink is prepared.\r\nThey have no oil, but use butter and fat instead.[902] There are no\r\nfruits, except the produce of trees in the royal gardens. Some feed even\r\nupon grass, the tender twigs of trees, the lotus, or the roots of reeds.\r\nThey live also upon the flesh and blood of animals, milk, and cheese.\r\nThey reverence their kings as gods, who are for the most part shut up in\r\ntheir palaces.\r\n\r\nTheir largest royal seat is the city of Meroë, of the same name as the\r\nisland. The shape of the island is said to be that of a shield. Its size\r\nis perhaps exaggerated. Its length is about 3000, and its breadth 1000\r\nstadia. It is very mountainous, and contains great forests. The\r\ninhabitants are nomades, who are partly hunters and partly husbandmen.\r\nThere are also mines of copper, iron, gold, and various kinds of\r\nprecious stones. It is surrounded on the side of Libya by great hills of\r\nsand, and on that of Arabia by continuous precipices. In the higher\r\nparts on the south, it is bounded by the confluent[903] streams of the\r\nrivers Astaboras,[904] Astapus,[905] and Astasobas. On the north is the\r\ncontinuous course of the Nile to Egypt, with its windings, of which we\r\nhave spoken before.\r\n\r\nThe houses in the cities are formed by interweaving split pieces of\r\npalm wood or of bricks.[906] They have fossil salt, as in Arabia. Palm,\r\nthe persea[907] (peach), ebony, and carob trees are found in abundance.\r\nThey hunt elephants, lions, and panthers. There are also serpents, which\r\nencounter elephants, and there are many other kinds of wild animals,\r\nwhich take refuge, from the hotter and parched districts, in watery and\r\nmarshy districts.\r\n\r\n3. Above Meroë is Psebo,[908] a large lake, containing a well-inhabited\r\nisland. As the Libyans occupy the western bank of the Nile, and the\r\nEthiopians the country on the other side of the river, they thus dispute\r\nby turns the possession of the islands and the banks of the river, one\r\nparty repulsing the other, or yielding to the superiority of its\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopians use bows of wood four cubits long, and hardened in the\r\nfire. The women also are armed, most of whom wear in the upper lip a\r\ncopper ring. They wear sheep-skins, without wool; for the sheep have\r\nhair like goats. Some go naked, or wear small skins or girdles of\r\nwell-woven hair round the loins.\r\n\r\nThey regard as God one being who is immortal, the cause of all things;\r\nanother who is mortal, a being without a name, whose nature is not\r\nclearly understood.\r\n\r\nIn general they consider as gods benefactors and royal persons, some of\r\nwhom are their kings, the common saviours and guardians of all; others\r\nare private persons, esteemed as gods by those who have individually\r\nreceived benefits from them.\r\n\r\nOf those who inhabit the torrid region, some are even supposed not to\r\nacknowledge any god, and are said to abhor even the sun, and to apply\r\nopprobrious names to him, when they behold him rising, because he\r\nscorches and tortures them with his heat; these people take refuge in\r\nthe marshes.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Meroë worship Hercules, Pan, and Isis, besides some\r\nother barbaric deity.[909]\r\n\r\nSome tribes throw the dead into the river; others keep them in the\r\nhouse, enclosed in hyalus (oriental alabaster?). [CAS. 822] Some bury\r\nthem around the temples in coffins of baked clay. They swear an oath by\r\nthem, which is reverenced as more sacred than all others.\r\n\r\nKings are appointed from among persons distinguished for their personal\r\nbeauty, or by their breeding of cattle, or for their courage, or their\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nIn Meroë the priests anciently held the highest rank, and sometimes sent\r\norders even to the king, by a messenger, to put an end to himself, when\r\nthey appointed another king in his place. At last one of their kings\r\nabolished this custom, by going with an armed body to the temple where\r\nthe golden shrine is, and slaughtering all the priests.\r\n\r\nThe following custom exists among the Ethiopians. If a king is mutilated\r\nin any part of the body, those who are most attached to his person, as\r\nattendants, mutilate themselves in the same manner, and even die with\r\nhim. Hence the king is guarded with the utmost care. This will suffice\r\non the subject of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n4. To what has been said concerning Egypt, we must add these peculiar\r\nproducts; for instance, the Egyptian bean, as it is called, from which\r\nis obtained the ciborium,[910] and the papyrus, for it is found here and\r\nin India only; the persea (peach) grows here only, and in Ethiopia; it\r\nis a lofty tree, and its fruit is large and sweet; the sycamine, which\r\nproduces the fruit called the sycomorus, or fig-mulberry, for it\r\nresembles a fig, but its flavour is not esteemed. The corsium also (the\r\nroot of the Egyptian lotus) grows there, a condiment like pepper, but a\r\nlittle larger.\r\n\r\nThere are in the Nile fish in great quantity and of different kinds,\r\nhaving a peculiar and indigenous character. The best known are the\r\noxyrynchus,[911] and the lepidotus,[912] the latus,[913] the\r\nalabes,[914] the coracinus,[915] the chœrus, the phagrorius, called also\r\nthe phagrus. Besides these are the silurus, the citharus,[916] the\r\nthrissa,[917] the cestreus,[918] the lychnus, the physa, the bous (or\r\nox), and large shell-fish which emit a sound like that of wailing.\r\n\r\nThe animals peculiar to the country are the ichneumon and the Egyptian\r\nasp, having some properties which those in other places do not possess.\r\nThere are two kinds, one a span in length, whose bite is more suddenly\r\nmortal than that of the other; the second is nearly an orguia[919] in\r\nsize, according to Nicander, the author of the Theriaca.\r\n\r\nAmong the birds, are the ibis and the Egyptian hawk, which, like the\r\ncat, is more tame than those elsewhere. The nycticorax is here peculiar\r\nin its character; for with us it is as large as an eagle, and its cry is\r\nharsh; but in Egypt it is the size of a jay, and has a different note.\r\nThe tamest animal, however, is the ibis; it resembles a stork in shape\r\nand size. There are two kinds, which differ in colour; one is like a\r\nstork, the other is entirely black. Every street in Alexandreia is full\r\nof them. In some respects they are useful; in others troublesome. They\r\nare useful, because they pick up all sorts of small animals and the\r\noffal thrown out of the butchers’ and cooks’ shops. They are\r\ntroublesome, because they devour everything, are dirty, and with\r\ndifficulty prevented from polluting in every way what is clean and what\r\nis not given to them.\r\n\r\n5. Herodotus[920] truly relates of the Egyptians, that it is a practice\r\npeculiar to them to knead clay with their hands, and the dough for\r\nmaking bread with their feet. Caces is a peculiar kind of bread which\r\nrestrains fluxes. Kiki (the castor-oil bean) is a kind of fruit sowed in\r\nfurrows. An oil is expressed from it which is used for lamps almost\r\ngenerally throughout the country, but for anointing the body only by the\r\npoorer sort of people and labourers, both men and women.\r\n\r\nThe coccina are Egyptian textures made of some plant,[921] woven like\r\nthose made of rushes, or the palm-tree.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 824] Barley beer is a preparation peculiar to the Egyptians. It\r\nis common among many tribes, but the mode of preparing it differs in\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThis, however, of all their usages is most to be admired, that they\r\nbring up all children that are born. They circumcise the males, and spay\r\nthe females, as is the custom also among the Jews, who are of Egyptian\r\norigin, as I said when I was treating of them.[922]\r\n\r\nAccording to Aristobulus, no fishes ascend the Nile from the sea, except\r\nthe cestreus, the thrissa, and dolphins, on account of the crocodiles;\r\nthe dolphin, because it can get the better of the crocodile; the\r\ncestreus, because it is accompanied by the chœri along the bank, in\r\nconsequence of some physical affinity subsisting between them. The\r\ncrocodiles abstain from doing any hurt to the chœri, because they are of\r\na round shape, and have spines on their heads, which are dangerous to\r\nthem. The cestreus runs up the river in spring, when in spawn; and\r\ndescends a little before the setting of the pleiad, in great numbers,\r\nwhen about to cast it, at which time they are taken in shoals, by\r\nfalling into inclosures (made for catching them). Such also, we may\r\nconjecture, is the reason why the thrissa is found there.\r\n\r\nSo much then on the subject of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We shall next describe Africa, which is the remaining portion of the\r\nwhole description of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe have before said much respecting it; but at present I shall further\r\ndescribe what suits my purpose, and add what has not been previously\r\nmentioned.[923]\r\n\r\nThe writers who have divided the habitable world according to\r\ncontinents, divide it unequally. But a threefold division denotes a\r\ndivision into three equal parts. Africa, however, wants so much of being\r\na third part of the habitable world, that, even if it were united to\r\nEurope, it would not be equal to Asia; perhaps it is even less than\r\nEurope; in resources it is very much inferior, for a great part of the\r\ninland and maritime country is desert. It is spotted over with small\r\nhabitable parts, which are scattered about, and mostly belonging to\r\nnomade tribes. Besides the desert state of the country, its being a\r\nnursery of wild beasts is a hindrance to settlement in parts which could\r\nbe inhabited. It comprises also a large part of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nAll the sea-coast in our quarter, situated between the Nile and the\r\nPillars, particularly that which belonged to the Carthaginians, is\r\nfertile and inhabited. And even in this tract, some spots destitute of\r\nwater intervene, as those about the Syrtes, the Marmaridæ, and the\r\nCatabathmus.\r\n\r\nThe shape of Africa is that of a right-angled triangle, if we imagine\r\nits figure to be drawn on a plane surface. Its base is the coast\r\nopposite to us, extending from Egypt and the Nile to Mauretania and the\r\nPillars; at right angles to this is a side formed by the Nile to\r\nEthiopia, which side we continue to the ocean; the hypothenuse of the\r\nright angle is the whole tract of sea-coast lying between Ethiopia and\r\nMauretania.\r\n\r\nAs the part situated at the vertex of the above-mentioned figure, and\r\nlying almost entirely under the torrid zone, is inaccessible, we speak\r\nof it from conjecture, and therefore cannot say what is the greatest\r\nbreadth of the country. In a former[924] part of this work we have said,\r\nthat the distance proceeding from Alexandreia southwards to Meroë, the\r\nroyal seat of the Ethiopians, is about 10,000 stadia; thence in a\r\nstraight line to the borders of the torrid zone and the habitable\r\ncountry, 3000 stadia. The sum, therefore, may be assumed as the greatest\r\nbreadth of Africa, which is 13,000 or 14,000 stadia: its length may be a\r\nlittle less than double this sum. So much then on the subject of Africa\r\nin general. I am now to describe its several parts, beginning from the\r\nmost celebrated on the west.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 825] 2. Here dwell a people called by the Greeks Maurusii, and by\r\nthe Romans and the natives Mauri, a populous and flourishing African\r\nnation, situated opposite to Spain, on the other side of the strait, at\r\nthe Pillars of Hercules, which we have frequently mentioned before. On\r\nproceeding beyond the strait at the Pillars, with Africa on the left\r\nhand, we come to a mountain which the Greeks call Atlas, and the\r\nbarbarians Dyris. Thence projects into the sea a point formed by the\r\nfoot of the mountain towards the west of Mauretania, and called the\r\nCoteis.[925] Near it is a small town, a little above the sea, which the\r\nbarbarians call Trinx; Artemidorus, Lynx; and Eratosthenes, Lixus.[926]\r\nIt lies on the side of the strait opposite to Gadeira,[927] from which\r\nit is separated by a passage of 800 stadia, the width of the strait at\r\nthe Pillars between both places. To the south, near Lixus and the\r\nCoteis, is a bay called Emporicus,[928] having upon it Phœnician\r\nmercantile settlements. The whole coast continuous with this bay abounds\r\nwith them. Subtracting these bays, and the projections of land in the\r\ntriangular figure which I have described, the continent may rather be\r\nconsidered as increasing in magnitude in the direction of south and\r\neast. The mountain which extends through the middle of Mauretania, from\r\nthe Coteis to the Syrtes, is itself inhabited, as well as others running\r\nparallel to it, first by the Maurusii, but deep in the interior of the\r\ncountry by the largest of the African tribes, called Gætuli.\r\n\r\n3. Historians, beginning with the voyage of Ophelas (Apellas?),[929]\r\nhave invented a great number of fables respecting the sea-coast of\r\nAfrica beyond the Pillars. We have mentioned them before, and mention\r\nthem now, requesting our readers to pardon the introduction of\r\nmarvellous stories, whenever we may be compelled to relate anything of\r\nthe kind, being unwilling to pass them over entirely in silence, and so\r\nin a manner to mutilate our account of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that the Sinus Emporicus (or merchants’ bay) has a cave\r\nwhich admits the sea at high tide to the distance even of seven stadia,\r\nand in front of this bay a low and level tract with an altar of Hercules\r\nupon it, which, they say, is not covered by the tide. This I, of course,\r\nconsider to be one of the fictitious stories. Like this is the tale,\r\nthat on other bays in the succeeding coast there were ancient\r\nsettlements of Tyrians, now abandoned, which consisted of not less than\r\nthree hundred cities, and were destroyed by the Pharusii[930] and the\r\nNigritæ. These people, they say, are distant thirty days’ journey from\r\nLynx.\r\n\r\n4. Writers in general are agreed that Mauretania is a fertile country,\r\nexcept a small part which is desert, and is supplied with water by\r\nrivers and lakes. It has forests of trees of vast size, and the soil\r\nproduces everything. It is this country which furnishes the Romans with\r\ntables, formed of one piece of wood, of the largest dimensions, and most\r\nbeautifully variegated. The rivers are said to contain crocodiles and\r\nother kinds of animals similar to those in the Nile. Some suppose that\r\neven the sources of the Nile are near the extremities of Mauretania. In\r\na certain river leeches are bred seven cubits in length, with gills,\r\npierced through with holes, through which they respire. This country is\r\nalso said to [CAS. 826] produce a vine, the girth of which two men can\r\nscarcely compass, and bearing bunches of grapes of about a cubit in\r\nsize. All plants and pot-herbs are tall, as the arum and\r\ndracontium;[931] the stalks of the staphylinus,[932] the\r\nhippomarathum,[933] and the scolymus[934] are twelve cubits in height,\r\nand four palms in thickness. The country is the fruitful nurse of large\r\nserpents, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes, and similar animals; of lions\r\nalso, and panthers. It produces weasels (jerboas?) equal in size and\r\nsimilar to cats, except that their noses are more prominent; and\r\nmultitudes of apes, of which Poseidonius relates, that when he was\r\nsailing from Gades to Italy, and approached the coast of Africa, he saw\r\na forest low upon the sea-shore full of these animals, some on the\r\ntrees, others on the ground, and some giving suck to their young. He was\r\namused also with seeing some with large dugs, some bald, others with\r\nruptures, and exhibiting to view various effects of disease.\r\n\r\n5. Above Mauretania, on the exterior sea (the Atlantic), is the country\r\nof the western Ethiopians, as they are called, which, for the most part,\r\nis badly inhabited. Iphicrates[935] says, that camel-leopards are bred\r\nhere, and elephants, and the animals called rhizeis,[936] which in shape\r\nare like bulls, but in manner of living, in size, and strength in\r\nfighting, resemble elephants. He speaks also of large serpents, and says\r\nthat even grass grows upon their backs; that lions attack the young of\r\nthe elephants, and that when they have wounded them, they fly on the\r\napproach of the dams; that the latter, when they see their young\r\nbesmeared with blood, kill them; and that the lions return to the dead\r\nbodies, and devour them; that Bogus king of the Mauretanians, during his\r\nexpedition against the western Ethiopians, sent, as a present to his\r\nwife, canes similar to the Indian canes, each joint of which contained\r\neight chœnices,[937] and asparagus of similar magnitude.\r\n\r\n6. On sailing into the interior sea, from Lynx, there are Zelis[938] a\r\ncity and Tingis,[939] then the monuments of the Seven Brothers,[940] and\r\nthe mountain lying below, of the name of Abyle,[941] abounding with\r\nwild animals and trees of a great size. They say, that the length of the\r\nstrait at the pillars is 120 stadia, and the least breadth at\r\nElephas[942] 60 stadia. On sailing further along the coast, we find\r\ncities and many rivers, as far as the river Molochath,[943] which is the\r\nboundary between the territories of the Mauretanians and of the\r\nMasæsyli. Near the river is a large promontory, and Metagonium,[944] a\r\nplace without water and barren. The mountain extends along the coast,\r\nfrom the Coteis nearly to this place. Its length from the Coteis to the\r\nborders of the Masæsylii[945] is 5000 stadia. Metagonium is nearly\r\nopposite to New Carthage.[946] Timosthenes is mistaken in saying that it\r\nis opposite to Massalia.[947] The passage across from New Carthage to\r\nMetagonium is 3000 stadia, but the voyage along the coast to Massalia is\r\nabove 6000 stadia.\r\n\r\n7. Although the Mauretanians inhabit a country, the greatest part of\r\nwhich is very fertile, yet the people in general continue even to this\r\ntime to live like nomades. They bestow care to improve their looks by\r\nplaiting their hair, trimming their beards, by wearing golden ornaments,\r\ncleaning their teeth, and paring their nails; and you would rarely see\r\nthem [CAS. 828] touch one another as they walk, lest they should\r\ndisturb the arrangement of their hair.\r\n\r\nThey fight for the most part on horseback, with a javelin; and ride on\r\nthe bare back of the horse, with bridles made of rushes. They have also\r\nswords. The foot-soldiers present against the enemy, as shields, the\r\nskins of elephants. They wear the skins of lions, panthers, and bears,\r\nand sleep in them. These tribes, and the Masæsylii next to them, and for\r\nthe most part the Africans in general, wear the same dress and arms, and\r\nresemble one another in other respects; they ride horses which are\r\nsmall, but spirited and tractable, so as to be guided by a switch. They\r\nhave collars[948] made of cotton or of hair, from which hangs a\r\nleading-rein. Some follow, like dogs, without being led.\r\n\r\nThey have a small shield of leather, and small lances with broad heads.\r\nTheir tunics are loose, with wide borders; their cloak is a skin, as I\r\nhave said before, which serves also as a breastplate.\r\n\r\nThe Pharusii and Nigretes, who live above these people, near the western\r\nEthiopians, use bows and arrows, like the Ethiopians. They have chariots\r\nalso, armed with scythes. The Pharusii rarely have any intercourse with\r\nthe Mauretanians in passing through the desert country, as they carry\r\nskins filled with water, fastened under the bellies of their horses.\r\nSometimes, indeed, they come to Cirta,[949] passing through places\r\nabounding with marshes and lakes. Some of them are said to live like the\r\nTroglodytæ, in caves dug in the ground. It is said that rain falls there\r\nfrequently in summer, but that during the winter drought prevails. Some\r\nof the barbarians in that quarter wear the skins of serpents and fishes,\r\nand use them as coverings for their beds. Some say that the\r\nMauretanians[950] are Indians, who accompanied Hercules hither. A little\r\nbefore my time, the kings Bogus and Bocchus, allies of the Romans,\r\npossessed this country; after their death, Juba succeeded to the\r\nkingdom, having received it from Augustus Cæsar, in addition to his\r\npaternal dominions. He was the son of Juba who fought, in conjunction\r\nwith Scipio, against divus Cæsar. Juba died[951] lately, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Ptolemy, whose mother was the daughter of Antony\r\nand Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n8. Artemidorus censures Eratosthenes for saying that there is a city\r\ncalled Lixus, and not Lynx, near the extremities of Mauretania; that\r\nthere are a very great number of Phœnician cities destroyed,[952] of\r\nwhich no traces are to be seen; and that among the western Ethiopians,\r\nin the evenings and the mornings, the air is misty and dense;—for how\r\ncould this take place where there is drought and excessive heat? But he\r\nhimself relates of these same parts what is much more liable to\r\nobjection. For he speaks of some tribes of Lotophagi, who had left their\r\nown country, and might have occupied the tract destitute of water; whose\r\nfood might be a lotus, a sort of herb, or root, which would supply the\r\nwant of drink; that these people extend as far as the places above\r\nCyrene, and that they live there on milk and flesh, although they are\r\nsituated in the same latitude.\r\n\r\nGabinius, the Roman historian, indulges in relating marvellous stories\r\nof Mauretania. He speaks of a sepulchre of Antæus at Lynx, and a\r\nskeleton of sixty feet in length, which Sertorius exposed, and\r\nafterwards covered it with earth.[953] His stories also about elephants\r\nare fabulous. He says, that other animals avoid fire, but that elephants\r\nresist and fight against it, because it destroys the forests; that they\r\nengage with men in battle, and send out scouts before them; that when\r\nthey perceive their enemies fly, they take to flight themselves; and\r\nthat when they are wounded, they hold out as suppliants branches of a\r\ntree, or a plant, or throw up dust.\r\n\r\n9. Next to Mauretania is the country of the Masæsylii, beginning from\r\nthe river Molocath, and ending at the promontory which is called\r\nTretum,[954] the boundary of the country of [CAS. 829] the Masæsyli and\r\nof the Masylies. From Metagonium to Tretum are 6000 stadia; according to\r\nothers, the distance is less.\r\n\r\nUpon the sea-coast are many cities and rivers, and a country which is\r\nvery fertile. It will be sufficient to mention the most renowned. The\r\ncity of Siga,[955] the royal seat of Syphax, is at the distance of 1000\r\nstadia from the above-mentioned boundaries. It is now razed. After\r\nSyphax, the country was in the possession of Masanasses, then of\r\nMicipsa, next of his successors, and in our time of Juba, the father of\r\nthe Juba who died lately. Zama,[956] which was Juba’s palace, was\r\ndestroyed by the Romans. At the distance of 600 stadia from Siga is\r\nTheon-limen (port of the gods);[957] next are some other obscure places.\r\n\r\nDeep in the interior of the country are mountainous and desert tracts\r\nscattered here and there, some of which are inhabited and occupied by\r\nGætuli extending to the Syrtes. But the parts near the sea are fertile\r\nplains, in which are numerous cities, rivers, and lakes.\r\n\r\n10. Poseidonius says, but I do not know whether truly, that Africa is\r\ntraversed by few, and those small rivers; yet he speaks of the same\r\nrivers, namely those between Lynx and Carthage, which Artemidorus\r\ndescribes as numerous and large. This may be asserted with more truth of\r\nthe interior of the country, and he himself assigns the reason of it,\r\nnamely, that in the northern parts of Africa (and the same is said of\r\nEthiopia) there is no rain; in consequence therefore of the drought,\r\npestilence frequently ensues, the lakes are filled with mud only, and\r\nlocusts appear in clouds.\r\n\r\nPoseidonius besides asserts that the eastern parts are moist, because\r\nthe sun quickly changes its place after rising; and that the western\r\nparts are dry, because the sun there turns in his course. Now, drought\r\nand moisture depend upon the abundance or scarcity of water, and on the\r\npresence or absence of the sun’s rays. But Poseidonius means to speak of\r\nthe effects produced by the sun, which all writers determine by the\r\nlatitude, north or south; but east and west, as applied to the residence\r\nof men, differ in different places, according to the position of each\r\ninhabited spot and the change of horizon; so that it cannot be asserted\r\ngenerally of places indefinite in number, that those lying to the east\r\nare moist, and those to the west dry: but as applied to the whole earth\r\nand such extremes of it as India and Spain, his expressions (east and\r\nwest) may be just; yet what truth or probability is there in his\r\n(attempted) explanation (of the causes of drought and moisture)? for in\r\nthe continuous and unceasing circuit of the sun, what turn can there be\r\nin his course? The rapidity too of his passage through every part is\r\nequal. Besides, it is contrary to evidence to say, that the extreme\r\nparts of Spain or Mauretania towards the west are drier than all other\r\nplaces, when at the same time they are situated in a temperate climate\r\nand have water in great abundance. But if we are to understand the\r\nturning of the sun in this way, that there at the extremities of the\r\nhabitable world he is above the earth, how does that tend to produce\r\ndrought? for there, and in other places situated in the same latitude,\r\nhe leaves them for an equal portion of the night and returns again and\r\nwarms the earth.\r\n\r\n11. Somewhere there, also, are copper mines; and a spring of asphaltus;\r\nscorpions of enormous size,[958] both with and without wings, are said\r\nto be found there, as well as tarantulas, remarkable for their size and\r\nnumbers. Lizards also are mentioned of two cubits in length. At the base\r\nof the mountains precious stones are said to be found, as those called\r\nthe Lychnitis (the ruby) and the Carchedonius (the carbuncle?). In the\r\nplains are found great quantities of oyster and mussel shells, similar\r\nto those mentioned in our description of Ammon. There is also a tree\r\ncalled melilotus, from which a wine is made. Some obtain two crops from\r\nthe ground and have two harvests, one in the spring, the other in the\r\nsummer. The straw is five cubits in height, and of the thickness of the\r\nlittle finger; the produce is 250-fold. They do not sow in the spring,\r\nbut bush-harrow the ground with bundles of the paliurus, and find the\r\nseed-grain sufficient which falls from [CAS. 831] the sheaves during\r\nharvest to produce the summer crop. In consequence of the number of\r\nreptiles, they work with coverings on the legs; other parts of the body\r\nalso are protected by skins.\r\n\r\n12. On this coast was a city called Iol,[959] which Juba, the father of\r\nPtolemy, rebuilt and changed its name to Cæsarea. It has a harbour and a\r\nsmall island in front of it. Between Cæsarea and Tretum[960] is a large\r\nharbour called Salda,[961] which now forms the boundary between the\r\nterritories subject to Juba and the Romans; for the country has been\r\nsubject to many changes, having had numerous occupants; and the Romans,\r\nat various times, have treated some among them as friends, others as\r\nenemies, conceding or taking away territories without observing any\r\nestablished rule.\r\n\r\nThe country on the side of Mauretania produced a greater revenue and was\r\nmore powerful, whilst that near Carthage and of the Masylies was more\r\nflourishing and better furnished with buildings, although it suffered\r\nfirst in the Carthaginian wars, and subsequently during the war with\r\nJugurtha, who successfully besieged Adarbal in Ityca (Utica),[962] and\r\nput him to death as a friend of the Romans, and thus involved the whole\r\ncountry in war. Other wars succeeded one another, of which the last was\r\nthat between divus Cæsar and Scipio, in which Juba lost his life. The\r\ndeath of the leaders was accompanied by the destruction of the cities\r\nTisiæus,[963] Vaga,[964] Thala,[965] Capsa[966] (the treasure-hold of\r\nJugurtha), Zama,[967] and Zincha. To these must be added those cities in\r\nthe neighbourhood of which divus Cæsar obtained victories over Scipio,\r\nnamely, first at Ruspinum,[968] then at Uzita, then at Thapsus and the\r\nneighbouring lake, and at many others. Near are the free cities Zella\r\nand Acholla.[969] Cæsar also captured at the first onset the island\r\nCercinna,[970] and Thena, a small city on the sea-coast. Some of these\r\ncities utterly disappeared, and others were abandoned, being partly\r\ndestroyed. Phara was burnt by the cavalry of Scipio.\r\n\r\n13. After Tretum follows the territory of the Masylies, and that of the\r\nCarthaginians which borders upon it. In the interior is Cirta, the royal\r\nresidence of Masanasses and his successors. It is a very strong place\r\nand well provided with everything, which it principally owes to Micipsa,\r\nwho established a colony of Greeks in it, and raised it to such\r\nimportance, that it was capable of sending out 10,000 cavalry and twice\r\nas many infantry. Here, besides Cirta, are the two cities Hippo,[971]\r\none of which is situated near Ityca, the other further off near Tretum,\r\nboth royal residences. Ityca is next to Carthage in extent and\r\nimportance. On the destruction of Carthage it became a metropolis to the\r\nRomans, and the head quarters of their operations in Africa. It is\r\nsituated in the very bay itself of Carthage, on one of the promontories\r\nwhich form it, of which the one near Ityca is called Apollonium, the\r\nother Hermæa. Both cities are in sight of each other. Near Ityca flows\r\nthe river Bagradas.[972] From Tretum to Carthage are 2,500 stadia, but\r\nauthors are not agreed upon this distance, nor on the distance (of\r\nCarthage) from the Syrtes.\r\n\r\n14. Carthage is situated upon a peninsula, comprising a circuit of 360\r\nstadia, with a wall, of which sixty stadia in length are upon the neck\r\nof the peninsula, and reach from sea to sea. Here the Carthaginians kept\r\ntheir elephants, it being a wide open place. In the middle of the city\r\nwas the acropolis, which they called Byrsa, a hill of tolerable height\r\nwith dwellings round it. On the summit was the temple of Esculapius,\r\nwhich was destroyed when the wife of Asdrubas burnt herself to death\r\nthere, on the capture of the city. Below the Acropolis were the harbours\r\nand the Cothon, a circular island, surrounded by a canal communicating\r\nwith the sea (Euripus), and on every side of it (upon the canal) were\r\nsituated sheds for vessels.\r\n\r\n[CAS. 832] 15. Carthage was founded by Dido, who brought her people\r\nfrom Tyre. Both this colony and the settlements in Spain and beyond the\r\nPillars proved so successful to the Phœnicians, that even to the present\r\nday they occupy the best parts on the continent of Europe and the\r\nneighbouring islands. They obtained possession of the whole of Africa,\r\nwith the exception of such parts as could only be held by nomade tribes.\r\nFrom the power they acquired they raised a city to rival Rome, and waged\r\nthree great wars against her. Their power became most conspicuous in the\r\nlast war, in which they were vanquished by Scipio Æmilianus, and their\r\ncity was totally destroyed. For at the commencement of this war, they\r\npossessed 300 cities in Africa, and the population of Carthage amounted\r\nto 700,000 inhabitants. After being besieged and compelled to surrender,\r\nthey delivered up 200,000 complete suits of armour and 3000[973] engines\r\nfor throwing projectiles, apparently with the intention of abandoning\r\nall hostilities; but having resolved to recommence the war, they at once\r\nbegan to manufacture arms, and daily deposited in store 140 finished\r\nshields, 300 swords, 500 lances, and 1000 projectiles for the engines,\r\nfor the use of which the women-servants contributed their hair. In\r\naddition to this, although at this moment they were in possession of\r\nonly twelve ships, according to the terms of the treaty concluded in the\r\nsecond war, and had already taken refuge in a body at the Byrsa, yet in\r\ntwo months they equipped 120 decked vessels; and, as the mouth of the\r\nCothon was closed against them, cut another outlet (to the sea) through\r\nwhich the fleet suddenly made its appearance. For wood had been\r\ncollected for a long time, and a multitude of workmen were constantly\r\nemployed, who were maintained at the public expense.\r\n\r\nCarthage, though so great, was yet taken and levelled to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Romans made a province of that part of the country which had been\r\nsubject to Carthage, and appointed ruler of the rest Masanasses and his\r\ndescendants, beginning with Micipsa. For the Romans paid particular\r\nattention to Masanasses on account of his great abilities and friendship\r\nfor them. For he it was who formed the nomades to civil life, and\r\ndirected their attention to husbandry. Instead of robbers he taught them\r\nto be soldiers. A peculiarity existed among these people; they inhabited\r\na country favoured in everything except that it abounded with wild\r\nbeasts; these they neglected to destroy, and so to cultivate the soil in\r\nsecurity; but turning their arms against each other, abandoned the\r\ncountry to the beasts of prey. Hence their life was that of wanderers\r\nand of continual change, quite as much as that of those who are\r\ncompelled to it by want and barrenness of soil or severity of climate.\r\nAn appropriate name was therefore given to the Masæsylii, for they were\r\ncalled Nomades.[974] Such persons must necessarily be sparing livers,\r\neaters of roots more than of flesh, and supported by milk and cheese.\r\nCarthage remained a desolate place for a long time, for nearly the same\r\nperiod, indeed, as Corinth, until it was restored about the same time\r\n(as the latter city) by divus Cæsar, who sent thither such Romans to\r\ncolonize it as elected to go there, and also some soldiers. At present\r\nit is the most populous city in Africa.\r\n\r\n16. About the middle of the gulf of Carthage is the island Corsura.[975]\r\nOn the other side of the strait opposite to these places is Sicily and\r\nLilybæum,[976] at the distance of (about) 1500 stadia; for this is said\r\nto be the distance from Lilybæum to Carthage. Not far from Corsura and\r\nSicily are other islands, among which is Ægimurus.[977] From Carthage\r\nthere is a passage of 60 stadia to the nearest opposite coast, from\r\nwhence there is an ascent of 120 stadia to Nepheris, a fortified city\r\nbuilt upon a rock. On the same gulf as Carthage, is situated a city\r\nTunis; hot springs and stone quarries are also found there; then the\r\nrugged promontory Hermæa,[978] [CAS. 834] on which is a city of the\r\nsame name; then Neapolis; then Cape Taphitis,[979] on which is a hillock\r\nnamed Aspis, from its resemblance (to a shield), at which place\r\nAgathocles, tyrant of Sicily, collected inhabitants when he made his\r\nexpedition against Carthage. These cities were destroyed by the Romans,\r\ntogether with Carthage. At the distance of 400 stadia from Taphitis is\r\nan island Cossuros, with a city of the same name, lying opposite to the\r\nriver Selinus in Sicily. Its circuit is 150 stadia, and its distance\r\nfrom Sicily about 600 stadia. Melite,[980] an island, is 500 stadia\r\ndistant from Cossuros. Then follows the city Adrumes,[981] with a naval\r\narsenal; then the Taracheiæ, numerous small islands; then the city\r\nThapsus,[982] and near it Lopadussa,[983] an island situated far from\r\nthe coast; then the promontory of Ammon Balithon, near which is a\r\nlook-out for[984] the approach of thunny; then the city Thena, lying at\r\nthe entrance of the Little Syrtis.[985] There are many small cities in\r\nthe intervening parts, which are not worthy of notice. At the entrance\r\nof the Syrtis, a long island stretches parallel to the coast, called\r\nCercinna; it is of considerable size, with a city of the same name;\r\nthere is also another smaller island Cercinnitis.\r\n\r\n17. Close, in the neighbourhood (of these islands), is the Little\r\nSyrtis, which is also called the Syrtis Lotophagitis (or the\r\nlotus-eating Syrtis). The circuit of this gulf is 1600, and the breadth\r\nof the entrance 600 stadia; at each of the promontories which form the\r\nentrance and close to the mainland is an island, one of which, just\r\nmentioned, is Cercinna, and the other Meninx;[986] they are nearly equal\r\nin size. Meninx is supposed to be the “land of the lotus-eaters”[987]\r\nmentioned by Homer. Certain tokens (of this) are shown, such as an altar\r\nof Ulysses and the fruit itself. For the tree called the lotus-tree is\r\nfound in abundance in the island, and the fruit is very sweet to the\r\ntaste. There are many small cities in it, one of which bears the same\r\nname as the island. On the coast of the Syrtis itself are also some\r\nsmall cities. In the recess (of the Syrtis) is a very considerable mart\r\nfor commerce, where a river discharges itself into the gulf. The effects\r\nof the flux and reflux of the tides extend up to this point, and at the\r\nproper moment the neighbouring inhabitants eagerly rush (to the shore)\r\nto capture the fish (thrown up).\r\n\r\n18. After the Syrtis, follows the lake Zuchis, 400 stadia (in circuit?),\r\nwith a narrow entrance, where is situated a city of the same name,\r\ncontaining factories for purple dyeing and for salting of all kinds;\r\nthen follows another lake much smaller; after this the city\r\nAbrotonon[988] and some others. Close by is Neapolis, which is also\r\ncalled Leptis.[989] From hence the passage across to the Locri\r\nEpizephyrii[990] is a distance of 3600 stadia. Next is the river\r\n[Cinyps].[991] Afterwards is a walled dam, constructed by the\r\nCarthaginians, who thus bridged over some deep swamps which extend far\r\ninto the country. There are some places here without harbours, although\r\nthe rest of the coast is provided with them. Next is a lofty wooded\r\npromontory, which is the commencement of the Great Syrtis, and called\r\nCephalæ (The Heads),[992] from whence to Carthage is a distance of a\r\nlittle more than 5000 stadia.\r\n\r\n19. Above the sea-coast from Carthage to Cephalæ (on the one hand) and\r\nto the territory of the Masæsyli (on the other) lies the territory of\r\nthe Libo-Phœnicians, extending (into the interior) to the mountainous\r\ncountry of the Gætuli, which belongs to Africa Proper. Above the Gætuli\r\nis the country of the Garamantes, lying parallel to the former, and from\r\nwhence are brought the Carthaginian pebbles (carbuncles). The Garamantes\r\nare said to be distant from the Ethiopians, who live on the borders of\r\nthe ocean, nine or ten days’ journey, and from the temple of Ammon\r\nfifteen days. Between the Gætuli and the coast of our sea (the\r\nMediterranean) there are many plains and many mountains, great lakes and\r\nrivers, some of which sink into the earth and disappear. The inhabitants\r\nare simple in their mode of life and in their dress; they marry numerous\r\nwives, and have a numerous offspring; in other respects they resemble\r\nthe nomade Arabians. The [CAS. 835] necks both of horses and oxen are\r\nlonger than in other countries.\r\n\r\nThe breeding of horses is most carefully attended to by the kings (of\r\nthe country); so much so, that the number of colts is yearly calculated\r\nat 100,000. Sheep are fed with milk and flesh, particularly near\r\nEthiopia. These are the customs of the interior.\r\n\r\n20. The circuit of the Great Syrtis is about 3930 stadia,[993] its depth\r\nto the recess is 1500 stadia, and its breadth at the mouth is also\r\nnearly the same. The difficulty of navigating both these and the Lesser\r\nSyrtis [arises from the circumstances of] the soundings in many parts\r\nbeing soft mud. It sometimes happens, on the ebbing and flowing of the\r\ntide, that vessels are carried upon the shallows, settle down, and are\r\nseldom recovered. Sailors therefore, in coasting, keep at a distance\r\n(from the shore), and are on their guard, lest they should be caught by\r\na wind unprepared, and driven into these gulfs. Yet the daring\r\ndisposition of man induces him to attempt everything, and particularly\r\nthe coasting along a shore. On entering the Great Syrtis on the right,\r\nafter passing the promontory Cephalæ, is a lake of about 300 stadia in\r\nlength, and 70 stadia in breadth, which communicates with the gulf, and\r\nhas at its entrance small islands and an anchorage. After the lake\r\nfollows a place called Aspis, and a harbour, the best of all in the\r\nSyrtis. Near this place is the tower Euphrantas, the boundary between\r\nthe former territory of Carthage and Cyrenaïca under Ptolemy (Soter).\r\nThen another place, called Charax,[994] which the Carthaginians\r\nfrequented as a place of commerce, with cargoes of wine, and loaded in\r\nreturn with silphium and its juice, which they received from merchants\r\nwho brought it away clandestinely from Cyrene; then the Altars of the\r\nPhilæni;[995] after these Automola, a fortress defended by a garrison,\r\nand situated in the recess of the whole gulf. The parallel passing\r\nthrough this recess is more to the south than that passing through\r\nAlexandreia by 1000 stadia, and than that passing through Carthage by\r\nless than 2000 stadia; but it would coincide with the parallel passing,\r\non one side, through Heroopolis, which is situated in the recess[996] of\r\nthe Arabian Gulf, and passing, on the other, through the interior of the\r\nterritory of the Masæsylii and the Mauretanians. The rest of the\r\nsea-coast, to the city Berenice,[997] is 1500 stadia in length. Above\r\nthis length of coast, and extending to the Altars of the Philæni, are\r\nsituated an African nation called Nasamones. The intervening distance\r\n(between the recess of the Syrtis and Berenice) contains but few\r\nharbours, and watering-places are rare.\r\n\r\nOn a promontory called Pseudopenias is situated Berenice, near a lake\r\nTritonis, in which is to be observed a small island with a temple of\r\nVenus upon it. There also is a lake of the Hesperides, into which flows\r\na river (called) Lathon. On this side of Berenice is a small promontory\r\ncalled Boreion[998] (or North Cape), which with Cephalæ forms the\r\nentrance of the Syrtis. Berenice lies opposite to the promontories of\r\nPeloponnesus, namely, those called Ichthys[999] and [Chelonatas],[1000]\r\nand also to the island Zacynthus,[1001] at an interval of 3600 stadia.\r\nMarcus Cato marched from this city, round the Syrtis, in thirty days, at\r\nthe head of an army composed of more than 10,000 men, separated into\r\ndivisions on account of the watering-places; his course lay through deep\r\nsand, under burning heat. After Berenice is a city Taucheira,[1002]\r\ncalled also Arsinoë; then Barca,[1003] formerly so called, but now\r\nPtolemaïs; [CAS. 837] then the promontory Phycus,[1004] which is low,\r\nbut extends further to the north than the rest of the African coast; it\r\nis opposite to Tænarum,[1005] in Laconia, at the distance[1006] of 2800\r\nstadia; on it there is also a small town of the same name as the\r\npromontory. Not far from Phycus, at a distance of about 170 stadia, is\r\nApollonias, the naval arsenal of Cyrene; from Berenice it is distant\r\n1000 stadia, and 80 stadia from Cyrene, a considerable city situated on\r\na table-land, as I observed it from the sea.\r\n\r\n21. Cyrene was founded by the inhabitants of Thera,[1007] a Lacedæmonian\r\nisland which was formerly called Calliste, as Callimachus says,\r\n\r\n   “Calliste once its name, but Thera in later times, the mother\r\n   of my home, famed for its steeds.”\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Cyrene is situated opposite to Criu-Metopon,[1008] the\r\nwestern cape of Crete, distant 2000 stadia. The passage is made with a\r\nsouth-south-west wind. Cyrene is said to have been founded by\r\nBattus,[1009] whom Callimachus claims to have been his ancestor. The\r\ncity flourished from the excellence of the soil, which is peculiarly\r\nadapted for breeding horses, and the growth of fine crops. It has\r\nproduced many men of distinction, who have shown themselves capable of\r\nworthily maintaining the freedom of the place, and firmly resisting the\r\nbarbarians of the interior; hence the city was independent in ancient\r\ntimes, but subsequently[1010] it was attacked [successfully] by the\r\nMacedonians, (who had conquered Egypt, and thus increased their power,)\r\nunder the command of Thibron the murderer of Harpalus: having continued\r\nfor some time to be governed by kings, it finally came under the power\r\nof the Romans, and with Crete forms a single province. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Cyrene are Apollonia, Barca, Taucheira, Berenice, and\r\nother small towns close by.\r\n\r\n22. Bordering upon Cyrenaïca is the district which produces silphium,\r\nand the juice called Cyrenaic, which the silphium discharges from\r\nincisions made in it. The plant was once nearly lost, in consequence of\r\na spiteful incursion of barbarians, who attempted to destroy all the\r\nroots. The inhabitants of this district are nomades.\r\n\r\nRemarkable persons of Cyrene were Aristippus,[1011] the Socratic\r\nphilosopher, who established the Cyrenaïc philosophy, and his daughter\r\nnamed Arete, who succeeded to his school; she again was succeeded by her\r\nson Aristippus, who was called Metrodidactos, (mother-taught,) and\r\nAnniceris, who is supposed to have reformed the Cyrenaïc sect, and to\r\nhave introduced in its stead the Anniceric sect. Callimachus and\r\nEratosthenes[1012] were also of Cyrene, both of whom were held in honour\r\nby the kings of Egypt; the former was both a poet and a zealous\r\ngrammarian; the latter followed not only these pursuits, but also\r\nphilosophy, and was distinguished above all others for his knowledge of\r\nmathematics. Carneades[1013] also came from [CAS. 838] thence, who by\r\ncommon consent was the first of the Academic philosophers, and\r\nApollonius Cronos, the master of Diodorus the Dialectician, who was also\r\ncalled Cronos, for the epithet of the master was by some transferred to\r\nthe scholar.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the sea-coast of Cyrene from Apollonia to Catabathmus is\r\n2200 stadia in length; it does not throughout afford facilities for\r\ncoasting along it; for harbours, anchorage, habitations, and\r\nwatering-places are few. The places most in repute along the coast are\r\nthe Naustathmus,[1014] and Zephyrium with an anchorage, also another\r\nZephyrium, and a promontory called Chersonesus,[1015] with a harbour\r\nsituated opposite to and to the south of Corycus[1016] in Crete, at the\r\ndistance of 2500 stadia; then a temple of Hercules, and above it a\r\nvillage Paliurus; then a harbour Menelaus, and a low promontory\r\nArdanixis, (Ardanis,)[1017] with an anchorage; then a great harbour,\r\nwhich is situated opposite to Chersonesus in Crete, at a distance of\r\nabout 3000 (2000?) stadia; for the whole of Crete, which is (a) long and\r\nnarrow (island), lies opposite and nearly parallel to this coast. After\r\nthe great harbour is another harbour, Plynos, and about it Tetra-pyrgia\r\n(the four towers). The place is called Catabathmus.[1018] Cyrenæa\r\nextends to this point; the remainder (of the coast) to Parætonium,[1019]\r\nand from thence to Alexandreia, we have spoken of in our account of\r\nEgypt.[1020]\r\n\r\n23. The country deep in the interior, and above the Syrtis and Cyrenæa,\r\na very sterile and dry tract, is in the possession of Libyans. First are\r\nthe Nasamones, then Psylli, and some Gætuli, then Garamantes; somewhat\r\nmore towards the east (than the Nasamones) are the Marmaridæ, who are\r\nsituated for the most part on the boundaries of Cyrenæa, and extend to\r\nthe temple of Ammon. It is asserted, that persons directing their course\r\nfrom the recess of the Great Syrtis, (namely,) from about the\r\nneighbourhood of Automala,[1021] in the direction of the winter\r\nsunrise, arrive on the fourth day at Augila.[1022] This place resembles\r\nAmmon, and is productive of palm trees, and is well supplied with water.\r\nIt is situated beyond Cyrenæa to the south: for 100 stadia the soil\r\nproduces trees; for another 100 stadia the land is only sown, but from\r\nexcessive heat does not grow rice.\r\n\r\nAbove these parts is the district which produces silphium, then follows\r\nthe uninhabited tract, and the country of the Garamantes. The district\r\nwhich produces silphium is narrow, long, and dry, extending in an\r\neasterly direction about 1000 stadia, but in breadth 300 stadia, or\r\nrather more, at least as far as has been ascertained. For we may\r\nconjecture that all countries which lie on the same parallel (of\r\nlatitude) have the same climate, and produce the same plants; but since\r\nmany deserts intervene, we cannot know every place. In like manner, we\r\nhave no information respecting the country beyond (the temple of) Ammon,\r\nnor of the oases, as far as Ethiopia, nor can we state distinctly what\r\nare the boundaries of Ethiopia, nor of Africa, nor even of the country\r\nclose upon Egypt, still less of the parts bordering on the ocean.\r\n\r\n24. Such, then, is the disposition of the parts of the world which we\r\ninhabit.[1023] But since the Romans have surpassed (in power) all former\r\nrulers of whom we have any record, and possess the choicest and best\r\nknown parts of it, it will be suitable to our subject briefly to refer\r\nto their Empire.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated[1024] how this people, beginning from [CAS.\r\n839] the single city of Rome, obtained possession of the whole of Italy,\r\nby warfare and prudent administration; and how, afterwards, following\r\nthe same wise course, they added the countries all around it to their\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\nOf the three continents, they possess nearly the whole of Europe, with\r\nthe exception only of the parts beyond the Danube, (to the north,) and\r\nthe tracts on the verge of the ocean, comprehended between the Rhine and\r\nthe Tanaïs (Don).\r\n\r\nOf Africa, the whole sea-coast on the Mediterranean is in their power;\r\nthe rest of that country is uninhabited, or the inhabitants only lead a\r\nmiserable and nomade life.\r\n\r\nOf Asia likewise, the whole sea-coast in our direction (on the west) is\r\nsubject to them, unless indeed any account is to be taken of the Achæi,\r\nZygi, and Heniochi,[1025] who are robbers and nomades, living in\r\nconfined and wretched districts. Of the interior, and of the parts far\r\ninland, the Romans possess one portion, and the Parthians, or the\r\nbarbarians beyond them, the other; on the east and north are Indians,\r\nBactrians, and Scythians; then (on the south) Arabians and Ethiopians;\r\nbut territory is continually being abstracted from these people by the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nOf all these countries some are governed by (native) kings, but the rest\r\nare under the immediate authority of Rome, under the title of provinces,\r\nto which are sent governors and collectors of tribute; there are also\r\nsome free cities, which from the first sought the friendship of Rome, or\r\nobtained their freedom as a mark of honour. Subject to her also are some\r\nprinces, chiefs of tribes, and priests, who (are permitted) to live in\r\nconformity with their national laws.\r\n\r\n25. The division into provinces has varied at different periods, but at\r\npresent it is that established by Augustus Cæsar; for after the\r\nsovereign power had been conferred upon him by his country for life, and\r\nhe had become the arbiter of peace and war, he divided the whole empire\r\ninto two parts, one of which he reserved to himself, the other he\r\nassigned to the (Roman) people. The former consisted of such parts as\r\nrequired military defence, and were barbarian, or bordered upon nations\r\nnot as yet subdued, or were barren and uncultivated, which though ill\r\nprovided with everything else, were yet well furnished with strongholds,\r\nand might thus dispose the inhabitants to throw off the yoke and rebel.\r\nAll the rest, which were peaceable countries, and easily governed\r\nwithout the assistance of arms, were given over to the (Roman) people.\r\nEach of these parts was subdivided into several provinces, which\r\nreceived respectively the titles of “provinces of Cæsar” and “provinces\r\nof the People.”\r\n\r\nTo the former provinces Cæsar appoints governors and administrators, and\r\ndivides the (various) countries sometimes in one way, sometimes in\r\nanother, directing his political conduct according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut the people appoint commanders and consuls to their own provinces,\r\nwhich are also subject to divers divisions when expediency requires it.\r\n\r\n(Augustus Cæsar) in his first organization of (the Empire) created two\r\nconsular governments, namely, (1.) the whole of Africa in possession of\r\nthe Romans, excepting that part which was under the authority, first of\r\nJuba, but now of his son Ptolemy; and (2.) Asia within the Halys and\r\nTaurus, except the Galatians and the nations under Amyntas, Bithynia,\r\nand the Propontis. He appointed also ten consular governments in Europe\r\nand in the adjacent islands. Iberia Ulterior (Further Spain) about the\r\nriver Bætis[1026] and Celtica Narbonensis[1027] (composed the two\r\nfirst). The third was Sardinia, with Corsica; the fourth Sicily; the\r\nfifth and sixth Illyria, districts near Epirus, and Macedonia; the\r\nseventh Achaia, extending to Thessaly, the Ætolians, Acarnanians, and\r\nthe Epirotic nations who border upon Macedonia; the eighth Crete, with\r\nCyrenæa; the ninth Cyprus; the tenth Bithynia, with the Propontis and\r\nsome parts of Pontus.\r\n\r\nCæsar possesses other provinces, to the government of which he appoints\r\nmen of consular rank, commanders of armies, or knights;[1028] and in his\r\n(peculiar) portion (of the empire) there are and ever have been kings,\r\nprinces, and (municipal) magistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

These names\r\nappear in this passage in a reversed but, as appears from Pliny, b. v.\r\n31, in their true chronological order.\r\n\r\n[50] Either an error of our author, or he speaks of its wine in\r\ncomparison with that of other islands.\r\n\r\n[51] After the death of Pericles.\r\n\r\n[52] Among distinguished natives of Samos, Strabo has omitted to mention\r\nMelissus the philosopher, who commanded the fleet of the island, and was\r\ncontemporary with Pericles.—_Plutarch, Life of Pericles._\r\n\r\n[53] Before called Drepanum.\r\n\r\n[54] Ischanli.\r\n\r\n[55] Scala Nova.\r\n\r\n[56] Pliny and Mela give a different origin and name to this town: by\r\nthem it is called Phygela from Φυγὴ, flight or desertion of the sailors,\r\nwho, wearied with the voyage, abandoned Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n[57] Chersiphron was of Gnossus in Crete. The ground being marshy on\r\nwhich the temple was to be built, he prepared a foundation for it of\r\npounded charcoal, at the suggestion of Theodorus, a celebrated statuary\r\nof Samos.\r\n\r\n[58] The temple is said to have been burnt the night Alexander the Great\r\nwas born.—_Cicero, de Nat. Deo._ ii. 27.\r\n\r\n[59] Plutarch says that the artist offered Alexander to make a statue of\r\nMount Athos, which should hold in the left hand a city, capable of\r\ncontaining 10,000 inhabitants, and pouring from the right hand a river\r\nfalling into the sea.\r\n\r\n[60] For the word κρήνη, a fountain, which occurs in the text before\r\nPenelope, and is here unintelligible, Kramer proposes to read κηρίνη.\r\nThe translation of the passage, thus corrected, would be, “a figure in\r\nwax of Penelope.” Kramer does not adopt the reading, on the ground that\r\nno figures in wax are mentioned by ancient authors.\r\n\r\n[61] ὀνήιστος.\r\n\r\n[62] Coraÿ is of opinion that the name of Artemidorus of Ephesus has\r\nbeen omitted by the copyist in this passage, before the name of\r\nAlexander. Kramer thinks that if the name had existed in the original\r\nmanuscript, it would have been accompanied, according to the practice of\r\nStrabo, with some notice of the writings of Artemidorus. The omission of\r\nthe name is remarkable, as Artemidorus is one of the geographers most\r\nfrequently quoted by Strabo. He flourished about 100 B. C. His geography\r\nin eleven books is lost. An abridgement of this work was made by\r\nMarcianus, of which some portions still exist, relating to the Black Sea\r\nand its southern shore.\r\n\r\n[63] It must have been in existence in the time of Strabo.—_Tacit.

Coraÿ suggests Elæus; Groskurd, Lainus,\r\nwhich Kramer does not approve of, although this part of the coast is now\r\ncalled Lithi. It seems to be near a place called Port Aluntha.\r\n\r\n[83] Cape Nicolo.\r\n\r\n[84] Psyra.\r\n\r\n[85] Ilias.\r\n\r\n[86] Ion was a contemporary of Sophocles. Theopompus was the disciple of\r\nSocrates, and the author of an epitome of the history of Herodotus, of a\r\nhistory of Greece, of a history of Philip, father of Alexander the\r\nGreat, and of other works. He was of the aristocratic or Macedonian\r\nparty. Theocritus, his contemporary, was a poet, orator, and historian;\r\nhe was of the democratic party. To these, among illustrious natives of\r\nChios, may be added Œnopides the astronomer and mathematician, who was\r\nthe discoverer of the obliquity of the ecliptic and the cycle of 59\r\nyears, for bringing the lunar and solar years into accordance; Nessus\r\nthe philosopher; his disciple Metrodorus (about B. C. 330) the sceptic,\r\nand master of Hippocrates; Scymnus the geographer, and author of a\r\ndescription of the earth.\r\n\r\n[87] The Homeridæ may have been at first descendants of Homer; but in\r\nlater times those persons went by the name Homeridæ, or Homeristæ, who\r\ntravelled from town to town for the purpose of reciting the poems of\r\nHomer. They did not confine themselves to that poet alone, but recited\r\nthe poetry of Hesiod, Archilochus, Mimnermus, and others; and finally\r\npassages from prose writers.—_Athenæus_, b. xiv. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[88] Of the 283 vessels sent by the eight cities of Ionia in the war\r\nwith Darius, one hundred came from Chios.\r\n\r\n[89] Kelisman.\r\n\r\n[90] Still to be found in collections of coins.\r\n\r\n[91] Leokaes?\r\n\r\n[92] B. xiii. c. iv. § 2.\r\n\r\n[93] Ak-Hissar.\r\n\r\n[94] Karadscha-Fokia.\r\n\r\n[95] Marseilles, b. iv. ch. i. § 4.\r\n\r\n[96] B. xiii. ch. i. § 2.\r\n\r\n[97] Jenidscheh.\r\n\r\n[98] Western Africa.\r\n\r\n[99] Gumusch-dagh.\r\n\r\n[100] According to Suidas, Daphnidas ridiculed oracles, and inquired of\r\nthe oracle of Apollo, “Shall I find my horse?” when he had none. The\r\noracle answered that he would find it. He was afterwards, by the command\r\nof Attalus, king of Pergamum, taken and thrown from a precipice called\r\nthe Horse.\r\n\r\n[101] The incursions of the Treres, with Cimmerians, into Asia and\r\nEurope followed after the Trojan war.

It was an absolute plague, which corrupted taste, and\r\nfinally destroyed the Greek theatre. We are not informed of the detail\r\nof these innovations, but from what we are able to judge by comparing\r\nStrabo with what is found in Athenæus, (b. xiv. § 14, p. 990, of Bohn’s\r\nClassical Library,) Simodia was designated by the name of Hilarodia,\r\n(joyous song,) and obtained the name Simodia from one Simus, or Simon,\r\nwho excelled in the art. The Lysiodi and Magodi, or Lysodia and Magodia,\r\nwere the same thing, according to some writers.

There is no\r\nauthority for the statement that its legs extended over the mouth of the\r\nharbour. It was overthrown 56 years after its erection. The fragments of\r\nthe Colossus remained on the ground 923 years, until they were sold by\r\nMoawiyeh, the general of the Caliph Othman IV., to a Jew of Emessa, who\r\ncarried them away on 900 camels, A.

In the time of\r\nScylax, the Rhodians possessed only the peninsula immediately in face of\r\ntheir island. As a reward for their assistance in the Antiochian war,\r\nthe Romans gave them a part of Lycia, and all Caria as far as the\r\nMæander. By having adopted a less prudent policy in the second Macedonic\r\nwar, they lost it all, including Caunus, the chief town of Peræa. It was\r\nnot long, however, before it was restored to them, together with the\r\nsmall islands near Rhodes; and from this time Peræa retained the limits\r\nwhich Strabo has described, namely, Dædala on the east and Mount Loryma\r\non the west, both included. Vespasian finally reduced Rhodes itself into\r\nthe provincial form, and joined it to Caria.—_Leake._\r\n\r\n[189] Samsun.\r\n\r\n[190] Eski Adalia, Old Attaleia; but the Greeks gave the name παλαιὰ\r\nἈττάλεια, Old Attaleia, to Perge.—_Leake._\r\n\r\n[191] Gunik.\r\n\r\n[192] Patera.\r\n\r\n[193] Minara.\r\n\r\n[194] Duvar.\r\n\r\n[195] Gillies, in his translation of Aristotle, makes use of this\r\nexample of the Lycians to prove that representative government was not\r\nunknown to the ancients.

Nor is Scylax less\r\nprecise in pointing out Kasteloryzo as Megiste, which name is found in\r\nan inscription copied by M. Cockerell from a rock at Castel Rosso. It\r\nwould seem, therefore, that this island was anciently known by both\r\nnames, (Megiste and Cisthene,) but in later times perhaps chiefly by\r\nthat of Megiste.\r\n\r\n[202] Cape Chelidonia.\r\n\r\n[203] Aboukir, nearly under the same meridian.\r\n\r\n[204] Tschariklar.\r\n\r\n[205] Garabasa.\r\n\r\n[206] Tschiraly.

See above, c. v.\r\n§ 11. But Strabo is here considering the two opinions held respecting\r\nthe isthmus.\r\n\r\n[275] Scymnus of Chios counts fifteen nations who occupied this\r\npeninsula, namely, three Greek and twelve barbarian. The latter were\r\nCilicians, Lycians, Carians, Maryandini, Paphlagonians, Pamphylians,\r\nChalybes, Cappadocians, Pisidians, Lydians, Mysians, and Phrygians. In\r\nthis list the Bithynians, Trojans, and Milyæ are not mentioned; but in\r\nit are found the Cappadocians and Lydians—two nations whom, according to\r\nStrabo, Ephorus has not mentioned. This discrepancy is the more\r\nremarkable as Scymnus must have taken the list from Ephorus himself.\r\n\r\n[276] Od. xi. 122.\r\n\r\n[277] Apollodorus, like Scymnus, had probably found the Lydians\r\nmentioned in the list of Ephorus, as also the Cappadocians.\r\n\r\n[278] Kramer says that he is unable to decide how this corrupt passage\r\nshould be restored. The translation follows the conjectures of Coray.\r\n\r\n[279] Il. ii. 862.\r\n\r\n[280] Il. iii. 187.\r\n\r\n[281] Isnik.\r\n\r\n[282] Euphorion acquired celebrity as a voluminous writer. Vossius, i.\r\n16, gives a catalogue of his works. According to Suidas, he was born in\r\nChalcis, in Negropont, at the time Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, was defeated\r\nby the Romans. He acquired a considerable fortune by his writings and by\r\nhis connexion with persons of eminent rank. He was invited to the court\r\nof Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, who intrusted him with the care\r\nof his library. According to Sallust, (Life of Tiberius,) he was one of\r\nthe poets whom Tiberius took as his model in writing Greek verse.

The Egyptians, Arabians,\r\nand Babylonians directed their invasions towards the north, to\r\nPalestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Iberia, and Colchis. This was\r\nthe line of march followed by Sesostris.\r\n\r\nPtolemy indicates the existence of “Pillars,” which he calls “the\r\nPillars of Alexander,” above Albania and Iberia, at the commencement of\r\nthe Asiatic Sarmatia. But as it is known that Alexander never penetrated\r\ninto these regions, it is clear that the title “of Alexander” was added\r\nby the Greeks to the names of mountains, which separated a country\r\npartly civilized from that entirely occupied by hordes of savages.\r\nEverything therefore seems to show, that these Pillars near Iberia in\r\nAsia, and not the Pillars of Hercules in Europe, formed the boundary of\r\nthe expeditions of Sesostris, Tearcho, and Nabuchodonosor.—_Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[310] As the Oxydraci are here meant, Groskurd adopts this name in the\r\ntext. They were settled in Sagur and Outch, of the province of Lahore.\r\n\r\n[311] Eurip. Bacchæ, v. 13.—_Wodehull._\r\n\r\n[312] Many cities and mountains bore the name of Nysa; but it is\r\nimpossible to confound the mountain Nysa, spoken of by Sophocles, with\r\nthe Nysa of India, which became known to the Greeks by the expedition\r\nonly of Alexander, more than a century after the death of the poet.\r\n\r\n[313] Probably interpolated.\r\n\r\n[314] Il. vi. 132. Nysa in India was unknown to Homer, who here refers\r\nto Mount Nysa in Thrace.\r\n\r\n[315] Strabo takes for the source of the Indus the place where it passes\r\nthrough the mountains to enter the Punjab. The site of Aornos seems to\r\ncorrespond with Renas.—_Gossellin_.\r\n\r\n[316] The Sibæ, according to Quintus Curtius, who gives them the name of\r\nSobii, occupied the confluent of the Hydaspes and the Acesines.\r\n\r\nThis people appear to have been driven towards the east by one of those\r\nrevolutions so frequent in all Asia. At least, to the north of Delhi,\r\nand in the neighbourhood of Hardouar, a district is found bearing the\r\nname of Siba.\r\n\r\n[317] That is, the Macedonians transferred the name of the Caucasus,\r\nsituated between the Black Sea and the Caspian, to the mountains of\r\nIndia. The origin of their mistake arose from the Indians giving, as at\r\npresent, the name of Kho, which signifies “white,” to the great chain of\r\nmountains covered with snow, from whence the Indus, and the greater part\r\nof the rivers which feed it, descend.\r\n\r\n[318] This people occupied the Paropamisus, where the mountains now\r\nseparate Candahar from Gaour.\r\n\r\n[319] Book ii. c. i. 2.\r\n\r\n[320] Under the name of Ariana, the ancients comprehended almost all the\r\ncountries situated between the Indus and the meridian of the Caspian\r\nGates. This large space was afterwards divided by them according to the\r\nposition of the different nations which occupied it.—_Gossellin._ There\r\ncan be no doubt the modern Iran represents the ancient Ariana. See\r\n_Smith_, art. Ariana, and b. ii. c. v. § 32, vol. i. p. 196, note^{903}.\r\n\r\n[321] Eratosthenes and Strabo believed that the eastern parts of Asia\r\nterminated at the mouth of the Ganges, and that, consequently, this\r\nriver discharged itself into the Eastern Ocean at the place where\r\nterminated the long chain of Taurus.\r\n\r\n[322] According to Major Rennell, Emodus and Imaus are only variations\r\nof the same name, derived from the Sanscrit word Himmaleh, which\r\nsignifies “covered with snow.”\r\n\r\n[323] In some MSS. the following diagram is to be found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The River Indus.]\r\n\r\n[324] The extremity of India, of which Eratosthenes speaks, is Cape\r\nComorin, which he placed farther to the east than the mouth of the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\n[325] Patelputer or Pataliputra near Patna, see b. ii. ch. i. §9.\r\n\r\n[326] The reading is σχοινίοις, which Coraÿ changes σχοίνοις, Schœni:\r\nsee Herod. i. 66. The Schœnus was 40 stadia. B. xii. ch. ii. §12.\r\n\r\n[327] Athenæus (b. xi. ch. 103, page 800, Bohn’s Classical Library)\r\nspeaks of Amyntas as the author of a work on the Stations of Asia. The\r\nStathmus, or distance from station to station, was not strictly a\r\nmeasure of distance, and depended on the nature of the country and the\r\ncapability of the beasts of burthen.\r\n\r\n[328] The reading Coliaci in place of Coniaci has been proposed by\r\nvarious critics, and Kramer, without altering the text, considers it the\r\ntrue form of the name. The Coliaci occupied the extreme southern part of\r\nIndia. Cape Comorin is not precisely the promontory Colis, or Coliacum,\r\nwhich seems to answer to Panban, opposite the island Ramanan Kor.\r\n\r\n[329] The Indian Caucasus.\r\n\r\n[330] Book ii. ch. i. § 3.\r\n\r\n[331] λίνον, probably the λίνον τὸ ἀπὸ δενδρέων, or cotton, of Arrian.\r\n\r\n[332] βόσμορον. § 18.\r\n\r\n[333] Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[334] The voyage from the Ganges to Ceylon, in the time of Eratosthenes,\r\noccupied seven days, whence he concluded that Ceylon was seven days’\r\nsail from the continent.\r\n\r\n[335] Groskurd reads 5000 stadia. B. ii. c. i. § 14.\r\n\r\n[336] εἰδοποιήσουσι. _Coraÿ._\r\n\r\n[337] The text is, as Coraÿ observes, obscure, if not corrupt.

See Prof. Wilson’s _Ariana Antiqua_.\r\n\r\n[360] Aspasii. _Coraÿ._\r\n\r\n[361] Peucela, in Arrian iv. 22. Rennell supposes it to be Puckholi, or\r\nPehkely.\r\n\r\n[362] Abisarus was king of the mountainous part of India, and, according\r\nto the conjecture of Vincent, which is not without some probability, his\r\nterritory extended to Cashmir.\r\n\r\n[363] India is bordered to the north, from Ariana to the Eastern Sea, by\r\nthe extremities of Taurus, to which the aboriginal inhabitants give the\r\ndifferent names of Paropamisus, Emodon, Imaon, and others, while the\r\nMacedonians call them Caucasus. The Emodi mountains were the Western\r\nHimalaya. See _Smith_, art. Emodi Montes.\r\n\r\n[364] The name of the modern city Lahore, anciently Lo-pore, recalls\r\nthat of Porus. It is situated on the Hyarotis or Hydraotes (Ravee),\r\nwhich does not contradict our author; for, as Vincent observes, the\r\nmodern Lahore represents the capital of the second Porus, whom Strabo\r\nwill mention immediately; and the Lahore situate between the Hydaspes\r\n(the Behut or Jelum) and the Acesines (the Chenab), the exact position\r\nof which is unknown, was that of the first Porus. Probably these two\r\ndistricts, in which the two cities were situated, formed a single\r\ndistrict only, one part of which was occupied and governed by Porus the\r\nuncle, and the other by Porus the nephew. It is probable, also, that\r\nthese two princes took their name from the country itself, Lahore, as\r\nthe prince of Taxila was called Taxiles, and the prince of Palibothra,\r\nPalibothrus.\r\n\r\n[365] Strabo’s Bucephalia was on the Hydaspes, between Beherat and\r\nTurkpoor, not far from Rotas. _Groskurd._ The exact site is not\r\nascertained, but the probabilities seem to be in favour of Jelum, at\r\nwhich place is the ordinary passage of the river, or of Jellapoor, about\r\n16 miles lower down. _Smith._\r\n\r\n[366] Ox-headed.\r\n\r\n[367] Cercopitheces.\r\n\r\n[368] Hence the Cathay of the Chinese and Modern Europe.\r\n\r\n[369] So also Arrian, who takes the number from Megasthenes. Pliny says\r\nthat nineteen rivers unite with the Indus.\r\n\r\n[370] Probably an interpolation.\r\n\r\n[371] The island Cos.\r\n\r\n[372] B. xv. c. i. § 7.\r\n\r\n[373] The Malli occupied a part of Moultan.\r\n\r\n[374] The Sambus of Arrian. Porticanus is the Oxycanus of Arrian. Both\r\nPorticanus and Musicanus were chiefs of the cicar of Sehwan. _Vincent’s\r\nVoyage of Nearchus_, p. 133.\r\n\r\n[375] This number is too large. There is probably an error in the text.\r\nGroskurd reads 20; but Kramer refers to Arrian’s expedition of\r\nAlexander, v. 20, and suggests that we may here read 100 (ρ) instead of\r\n200 (σ).\r\n\r\n[376] The Seres are here meant, whose country and capital still preserve\r\nthe name of Serhend. It was the Serica India of the middle ages, and to\r\nthis country Justinian sent to procure silkworms’ eggs, for the purpose\r\nof introducing them into Europe. Strabo was not acquainted with the\r\nSeres of Scythia, whose territory is now called Serinagar, from whence\r\nthe ancients procured the wool and fine fabrics which are now obtained\r\nfrom Cashmir; nor was he acquainted with the Seres who inhabited the\r\npeninsula of India, and whose territory and capital have retained the\r\nname of Sera. Pliny is the only ancient author who seems to have spoken\r\nof these latter Seres. _Gossellin._ The passage in brackets is supposed\r\nby Groskurd to be an interpolation. Meineke would retain it, by reading\r\nκαί τοι for καὶ γὰρ.\r\n\r\n[377] The passage is corrupt, and for κήτη, “whales or cetaceous\r\nanimals,” Groskurd proposes λέγει. The whole would therefore thus be\r\ntranslated, “and speaks of what he saw on it, of its magnitude,” &c.\r\n\r\n[378] The exaggeration of Megasthenes is nothing in comparison of Ælian,\r\nwho gives to the Ganges a breadth of 400 stadia. Modern observations\r\nattribute to the Ganges a breadth of about three quarters of a\r\ngeographical mile, or 30 stadia.\r\n\r\n[379] About 120 feet.\r\n\r\n[380] Hiranjavahu.\r\n\r\n[381] B. ii. c. i. § 9.\r\n\r\n[382] B. xvi. c. i. § 28.\r\n\r\n[383] Herodotus iii. 102. The marmot?\r\n\r\n[384] The passage is corrupt. Groskurd proposes to add the word ὥς\r\nbefore καὶ καμήλους, “as camels.” Coraÿ changes the last word to\r\nἀχαλίνους, which is adopted in the translation. See below, § 53.\r\n\r\n[385] θρίσσα.\r\n\r\n[386] κεστρεύς.\r\n\r\n[387] καρίδες.\r\n\r\n[388] In the text, μέχρι ὄρους, “to a mountain.” Coraÿ changes the last\r\nword to the name of a people, Οὔρων, but Strabo does not appear to have\r\nbeen acquainted with them; Groskurd, to ὀρῶν. The translation adopts\r\nthis correction, with the addition of the article, which, as Kramer\r\nobserves, is wanting if we follow Groskurd.\r\n\r\n[389] Groskurd proposes τειχῶν, “walls,” in place of, τιμῶν, “prices.”\r\n\r\n[390] Κώδων, “a bell,” or gong, or trumpet?\r\n\r\n[391] The orguia was equal to four cubits, or six feet one inch.\r\n\r\n[392] Men who slept on their ears. See b. i. c. ii. § 35.\r\n\r\n[393] The Brahmins.\r\n\r\n[394] Sarmanes, Clem. Alex. Strom. i. 305.\r\n\r\n[395] Meineke’s conjecture, ἐσθητοὺς φλοιῷ δενδρείῳ.\r\n\r\n[396] According to Diodorus Siculus, xix. 33, an exception was made for\r\nwomen with child, or with a family; but otherwise, if she did not comply\r\nwith this custom, she was compelled to remain a widow during the rest of\r\nher life, and to take no part in sacrifices or other rites, as being an\r\nimpious person.\r\n\r\n[397] By Arrian and Plutarch he is called Dandamis.\r\n\r\n[398] By φιμοῖς, probably here is meant a circular segment, or band of\r\niron, furnished with slightly raised points in the inside; it passes\r\nover the bone of the nose, and is fastened below by a cord which is\r\ncontinued as a bridle. Such a contrivance is still in use for mules and\r\nasses in the East.\r\n\r\n[399] Coraÿ reads πόθος instead of κόρος in the text. The translation\r\nwould then be, “who required nothing;” but ἐκείνου here refers to\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\n[400] On the day of his birth, Herod. ix. 109.\r\n\r\n[401] Of Armenia.\r\n\r\n[402] About 6 feet.\r\n\r\n[403] The text is corrupt. Tzschucke’s emendation is adopted, viz.\r\nβόνασοι. Groskurd translates the word by “hump-backed oxen,” or zebus.\r\n\r\n[404] Ælian de Nat. Animal. xvii. 21.\r\n\r\n[405] Bird of paradise?\r\n\r\n[406] Not far from the present Anopschir on the Ganges, south-east from\r\nDelhi. _Groskurd._\r\n\r\n[407] Patalputer, b. ii. c. i. § 9.\r\n\r\n[408] Probably the Iomanes.\r\n\r\n[409] A subordinate town in the pachalic of Aleppo, and its modern name\r\nis still Antakieh. It was anciently distinguished as Antioch by the\r\nOrontes, because it was situated on the left bank of that river, where\r\nits course turns abruptly to the west, after running northwards between\r\nthe ranges of Lebanon and Antilebanon, and also Antioch by Daphne,\r\nbecause of the celebrated grove of Daphne which was consecrated to\r\nApollo, in the immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[410] In Dion Cassius, liv. ix. he is called Zarmanus, a variation\r\nprobably of Garmanus, see above, § 60. Chegas, or Sheik, seems to be the\r\nTartar title Chan or Khan, which may be detected also in the names\r\nMusi-canus, Porti-canus, Oxy-canus, Assa-canus, _Vincent, Voyage of\r\nNearchus_, p. 129. Groskurd writes Zarmanos Chanes.\r\n\r\n[411] Bargosa is probably a corruption of Barygaza mentioned in Arrian’s\r\nPeriplus of the Red Sea. It was a large mart on the north of the river\r\nNerbudda, now Baroatsch or Barutsch. _Groskurd._\r\n\r\n[412] “Beyond,” as Strabo has just been speaking of India, with\r\nreference to which Ariana is to the west of the Indus.\r\n\r\n[413] To the south of the great chain bearing that name, extending from\r\nwest to east of Asia.\r\n\r\n[414] The exact place corresponding with the Caspiæ Pylæ is probably a\r\nspot between Hark-a-Koh and Siah-Koh, about 6 parasangs from Rey, the\r\nname of the entrance of which is called Dereh. _Smith_, art. Caspiæ\r\nPylæ.\r\n\r\n[415] An extensive province of Asia along the northern side of the\r\nPersian Gulf, extending from Carpella (either C. Bombareek or C. Isack)\r\non the E. to the river Bagradas (Nabend) on the W. According to Marcian\r\nthe distance between these points was 4250 stadia. It appears to have\r\ncomprehended the coast-line of the modern Laristan, Kirman, and\r\nMoghostan. It was bounded on the N. by Parthia and Ariana; on the E. by\r\nDrangiana and Gedrosia; on the S. by the Persian Gulf, and on the W. by\r\nPersis. _Smith_, art. Carmania.\r\n\r\n[416] The Purali.\r\n\r\n[417] Mekran.\r\n\r\n[418] By the achronical rising of the Pleiades is meant the rising of\r\nthis constellation, or its first becoming visible, after sunset.\r\nVincent (Voyage of Nearchus) fixes on the 23rd October, 327 B. C., as\r\nthe date of the departure of Alexander from Nicæa; August, 326 B. C., as\r\nthe date of his arrival at Pattala; and the 2nd of October, 326 B. C.,\r\nas the date of the departure of the fleet from the Indus.\r\n\r\n[419] The pith in the young head-shoot of the palm-tree.\r\n\r\n[420] Called Pura by Arrian.\r\n\r\n[421] The Oritæ are no doubt here meant.\r\n\r\n[422] By the line drawn from the Caspian Gates to Carmania.\r\n\r\n[423] See above, c. i. § 12.\r\n\r\n[424] Herat.\r\n\r\n[425] Candahar.\r\n\r\n[426] See b. xi. c. viii. § 9.\r\n\r\n[427] The text is corrupt: ἐκ μέρους is probably taken from some other\r\npart of the text and here inserted.\r\n\r\n[428] The same as Zarangæ; they probably dwelt on the lake Zarah, which\r\nundoubtedly retains its Zend name. _Wilson’s_ Ariana.\r\n\r\n[429] Corresponding nearly with the present Hamadan.\r\n\r\n[430] None is said to be found there at the present day.\r\n\r\n[431] They were called Ariaspi; Cyrus, son of Cambyses, gave them the\r\nname Euergetæ, “benefactors,” in consideration of the services which\r\nthey had rendered in his expedition against the Scythians.\r\n\r\n[432] At the beginning of winter.\r\n\r\n[433] The text is corrupt; the words between brackets are supplied by\r\nKramer’s conjecture.

Kramer’s proposed reading is adopted of\r\nseparating the amount.\r\n\r\n[437] Ariana in the text. Groskurd proposes to read Carmania; Kramer,\r\nBactriana.\r\n\r\n[438] About 140 feet. Arrian says twenty-five orguiæ, or about 150 feet.\r\n\r\n[439] Groskurd proposes to supply after “Sea” words which he thinks are\r\nhere omitted; upon insufficient grounds, however, according to Kramer.\r\n\r\n[440] The Arosis of Arrian, now the Tab.\r\n\r\n[441] This passage is very corrupt, and many words, according to Kramer,\r\nappear to be omitted. See b. ii. c i. § 26. We read with Groskurd\r\n“Media” for “Caspian Gates” in the text: and insert “9000 stadia,” here\r\nfrom b. ii. c. i. § 26, and, following the same authority, 3000 for 2000\r\nstadia in the text below.\r\n\r\n[442] Persæ, v. 17 and 118.\r\n\r\n[443] Pasa or Fesa.\r\n\r\n[444] Taug or Taüog, on the river Grâ.\r\n\r\n[445] The Uxii occupied the district of Asciac.\r\n\r\n[446] There seems little doubt that the Karun represents the ancient\r\nEulæus (on which some authors state Susa to have been situated), and the\r\nKerkhah the old Choaspes. See _Smith_, art. Choaspes.\r\n\r\n[447] Groskurd adds 1000 stadia to this amount.\r\n\r\n[448] Quin. Curtius, v. 10. Diod.

Ptolem. vi. 1. They appear\r\nto have left vestiges of their name in that of a gulf, and a port called\r\nDelem.\r\n\r\n[461] The account of the Persians is taken from Herodotus, i. 131, &c.\r\n\r\n[462] According to Herodotus, the priest who sacrificed was crowned.\r\n\r\n[463]\r\n\r\n   Roused the sacred fire, as the law bids,\r\n   Touching the god with consecrated wand.\r\n\r\n   _Athenæus_ xii. 40, p. 850.

The Cardaces were not Persians, but foreign\r\nsoldiers. “Barbari milites quos Persæ Cardacas appellant,” (Cornel.\r\nNepos.) without doubt were Assyrian and Armenian Carduci. See b. xvi. c.\r\ni. § 24, and Xenoph. Anab. iv. 3. Later Gordyæi or Gordyeni, now the\r\nKurds. _Groskurd._\r\n\r\n[469] Cardamum is probably the “lepidum perfoliatum” of Linnæus, or the\r\n“nasturtium orientale” of Tournefort. Xenophon also, Expedit. Cyr. iii.\r\n5 and vii. 8, speaks of the great use made of this plant by the\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\n[470] The length of the arms and the surname “Longhand” here given to\r\nDarius are assigned by others to Artaxerxes. It was in fact the latter\r\nto whom this surname was given, according to Plutarch, in consequence of\r\nthe right arm being longer than the left. Therefore Falconer considers\r\nthis passage an interpolation. _Coraÿ._\r\n\r\n[471] This, says Gossellin, may account for the rarity of the Persian\r\nDarius, badly struck, and coined long before the time of Alexander, and\r\nappearing to belong to a period anterior to the reign of Darius\r\nHystaspes.\r\n\r\n[472] Chalybon was the name of the modern Aleppo, but the wine of\r\nDamascus must have possessed the same qualities, and had the same name.\r\n“The Chalybonian wine, Posidonius says, is made in Damascus in Syria,\r\nfrom vines which were planted there by the Persians.” _Athenæus_, b. i.\r\npage 46, Bohn’s Classical Library.\r\n\r\n[473] In the text “ten or eleven years,” which reading is contrary to\r\nall other authorities, and is rejected by Kramer.\r\n\r\n[474] This is only an approximation. From the conquest of the Medes by\r\nCyrus to the death of Darius Codomanus, last king of Persia, is a period\r\nof 225 years.\r\n\r\n[475] According to Dion Cassius, xviii. § 26, Aturia is synonymous with\r\nAssyria, and only differs from it by a barbarous pronunciation; which\r\nshows that the name Assyria belonged peculiarly to the territory of\r\nNineveh.\r\n\r\n[476] Aiaghi-dagh.\r\n\r\n[477] It is to be remarked that the people bordering upon the Gordyæi\r\nare the only people of Mesopotamia here mentioned, for the whole of\r\nMesopotamia, properly so called, is comprised under the name of Assyria.\r\n\r\n[478] The bridge or passage at the foot of the modern fortress\r\nRoum-Kala.\r\n\r\n[479] B. xii. c. iii. § 5; Herod. i. 6 and 72.\r\n\r\n[480] Al.

Such\r\nwas the διατείχισμα Σεμιράμιδος, constructed between the Euphrates and\r\nthe Tigris, and intended, together with canals brought from those\r\nrivers, to protect Babylon from the incursions of the Arabian Scenitæ or\r\nMedes. B. ii.\r\n\r\n[482] κλίμακες, roads of steep ascent, with steps such as may be seen in\r\nthe Alps of Europe; the word differs from ὁδοὶ, roads below, inasmuch as\r\nthe former roads are only practicable for travellers on foot and beasts\r\nof burthen, the latter for carriages also.\r\n\r\n[483] The union of these two names, says Kramer, is remarkable, and\r\nstill more so is the insertion of the article τῆς before them: he,\r\ntherefore, but with some hesitation, suggests that the word μάχης has\r\nbeen omitted in the text by the copyist.\r\n\r\n[484] Assyrians.\r\n\r\n[485] Erbil.\r\n\r\n[486] Called also Zabus, Zabatus, and Zerbes, now the Great Zab.\r\n\r\n[487] Adopting Kramer’s reading, καὶ ἃ.\r\n\r\n[488] Probably a branch of the Karadgeh-dagh.\r\n\r\n[489] The Little Zab, or Or.\r\n\r\n[490] As the name Artacene occurs nowhere else, Groskurd, following\r\nCellarius (v. Geogr. Ant. i. 771), suspects that here we ought to read\r\nArbelene, and would understand by it the same district which is called\r\nArbelitis by Ptolemy, vi. 1, and by Pliny, H. N. vi. 13, § 16, but as\r\nthis form of the national name is nowhere to be found, it would appear\r\nimproper to introduce it into the text. It is more probable, continues\r\nKramer, that Strabo wrote Adiabene, of which Arbelitis was a part,\r\naccording to Pliny, loco citato.\r\n\r\n[491] The same, no doubt, as the goddess Anaïtis. B. xi. c. viii. § 4,\r\nand b. xv. c. iii. § 15.\r\n\r\n[492] All manuscripts agree in giving this number, but critics agree\r\nalso in its being an error for 365. The number of stadia in the wall,\r\naccording to ancient authors, corresponded with the number of days in\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n[493] That is, at a short distance from the Persian Gulf, a little more\r\nto the south than the modern town Basra.\r\n\r\n[494] Some extensive ruins near the angle formed by the Adhem (the\r\nancient Physcus) and the Tigris, and the remains of the Nahr-awan canal,\r\nare said to mark the site of Opis.\r\n\r\n[495] The name Cœle-Syria, or Hollow Syria, which was properly applied\r\nto the district between Libanus and Antilibanus, was extended also to\r\nthat part of Syria which borders upon Egypt and Arabia; and it is in\r\nthis latter sense that Strabo here speaks of Cœle-Syria. So also\r\nDiodorus Siculus, i. § 30, speaks of “Joppa in Cœle-Syria;” and\r\nPolybius, v. 80, § 2, of “Rhinocolura, the first of the cities in\r\nCœle-Syria;” and Josephus, Ant. Jud. xiii. 13, § 2, “of Scythopolis of\r\nCœle-Syria.”\r\n\r\n[496] El-Arish.\r\n\r\n[497] El-Kas near Sebakit-Bardoil, the ancient lake Serbonis.\r\n\r\n[498] Barathra.\r\n\r\n[499] Strabo has misunderstood the meaning of Eratosthenes, who had said\r\nthat the excess of the waters of the Euphrates sunk into the ground and\r\nreappeared under the form of torrents, which became visible near\r\n“Rhinocolura in Cœle-Syria and Mt. Casius,” the Casius near Egypt. Our\r\nauthor properly observes that the length and nature of the course\r\ncontradicts this hypothesis: but, misled by the names Cœle-Syria and\r\nCasius, he forgets that the Casius of Egypt and the district bordering\r\nupon Egypt, improperly called Cœle-Syria, are here in question; he\r\ntransfers the first name to Cœle-Syria of Libanus, and the second to Mt.\r\nCasius near Seleucia and Antioch, and adds that, according to the notion\r\nof Eratosthenes, the waters of the Euphrates would have to traverse\r\nLibanus, Antilibanus, and the Casius (of Syria), whilst Eratosthenes has\r\nnot, and could not, say any such thing. The hypothesis of Eratosthenes\r\ncould not, indeed, be maintained, but Strabo renders it absurd. The\r\nerror of our author is the more remarkable, as the name of the city\r\nRhinocolura ought necessarily to have suggested to him the sense in\r\nwhich the words Casius and Cœle-Syria should be understood.\r\n\r\n[500] καὶ οὕτως πλημμυρεῖν. These words are, as Kramer proposes,\r\ntransferred from below. There can be no meaning given to them as they\r\nstand in the text, which is here corrupt.\r\n\r\n[501] Herod. i. 193.\r\n\r\n[502] Herod. i. 194.\r\n\r\n[503] Al-Madain.\r\n\r\n[504] Strabo probably here refers to Hecatompylos, which, in b. xi. c.\r\nix. § 1, he calls “the royal seat of the Parthians,” and which shared\r\nwith Ecbatana the honour of being a residence of the Parthian kings. The\r\nname Hyrcania has here a wide meaning; the proper name would have been\r\nParthia.\r\n\r\n[505] Cicero de Nat.

Strabo frequently mentions together the three successive\r\ngovernments of Persians, Macedonians, and Parthians.

C., and 124 years after\r\nthe expedition of Antiochus.\r\n\r\n[516] Probably the Djerrahi.\r\n\r\n[517] On comparing this passage with others, (b. xi. c. xiv. § 12, and\r\nb. xvi. c. i. § 1, and c. i. § 8,) in which Strabo speaks of Adiabene,\r\nwe perceive that he understood it to be a part of the country below the\r\nmountains of Armenia, and to the north of Nineveh, on both banks of the\r\nTigris. Other authors have given a more extended meaning to the name,\r\nand applied it to the country on the north of the two rivers Zab, from\r\nwhence (Amm. Marcel. xxiii. 5, 6) the name Adiabene appears to be\r\nderived. In this sense Adiabene may be considered the same as Assyria\r\nProper.\r\n\r\n[518] B. xi. c. xiv. § 15.\r\n\r\n[519] Groskurd proposes reading Saulopodes, delicate walkers, in place\r\nof Saccopodes, sack-footed.\r\n\r\n[520] Herod. i. 198. Almost all the details concerning the Babylonian\r\ncustoms are taken from Herodotus, who sets them forth with greater\r\nclearness; there are, however, some differences, as, for example, the\r\ndisposal of young women in marriage, and the different tribunals, which\r\nprove that Strabo had other sources of information.\r\n\r\n[521] Groskurd here suspects a corruption of the text, and for τούτου\r\nreads τοῦ πρώτου, “of the first,” and for ἄλλου, “of another,” δευτέρου,\r\n“of the second.”\r\n\r\n[522] Merkan.\r\n\r\n[523] El-der.\r\n\r\n[524] The Van.

C. 51.\r\n\r\n[533] Gordyæa was the most northerly part of Assyria, or Kurdistan, near\r\nthe lake Van. From Carduchi, the name of the inhabitants, is derived the\r\nmodern name Kurds.\r\n\r\n[534] Pliny, x. c. iii. and xxxvi. c. xix., calls it “Gagates lapis;” a\r\nname derived, according to Dioscorides, from a river Gagas in Lycia.\r\n\r\n[535] Herod. vi. 199.\r\n\r\n[536] These appear to be the rivers found in the neighbourhood of Roha\r\nor Orfa, the ancient Edessa. One of these rivers bears the name of\r\nBeles, and is perhaps the Basileios of Strabo. Chabur is the Aborrhas.\r\n\r\n[537] Probably an interpolation.\r\n\r\n[538] The passage of the Euphrates here in question was effected at the\r\nZeugma of Commagene, called by Strabo the present passage. On passing\r\nthe river you entered Anthemusia, a province which appears to have\r\nreceived, later on, the name of Osroene. It extended considerably\r\ntowards the north, for in it the Aborrhas, according to Strabo, had its\r\nsource; but it is doubtful whether it extended to the north of Mount\r\nMasius, where the latitudes, as given by Ptolemy, would place it. I do\r\nnot exactly know whether Strabo intends to speak of a city or a\r\nprovince, for the position of the city is unknown; we only learn from a\r\npassage in Pliny, vi. c. xxvi., that it was not on the Euphrates. The\r\nword τόπος is not, I think, so applicable to a province as to a city,\r\nand in this last sense I have understood it, giving also to κατὰ the\r\nmeaning of latitude, in which it is so often applied by Strabo; strictly\r\nspeaking, the sense of “vis-à-vis,” “opposite to,” might be given to\r\nit.—_Letronne._\r\n\r\n[539] This is an error of the author or of the copyist. Edessa (now\r\nOrfa) is not to be confounded with Bambyce (Kara-Bambuche, or Buguk\r\nMunbedj) of Cyrrhestica in Syria, which obtained its Hellenic name from\r\nSeleucus Nicator.\r\n\r\n[540] B. C. 54.\r\n\r\n[541] The Parthians became masters of Syria under Pacorus, and of Asia\r\nMinor under Labienus. B. C. 38.\r\n\r\n[542] Artavasdes, king of the Armenians. B. xi. c. xiii. § 4.\r\n\r\n[543] The text would lead us to suppose that Phraates succeeded Pacorus,\r\nwhereas below, § 8, Pacorus, the eldest son of the Parthian king, died\r\nbefore his father, Orodes. Letronne, therefore, and Groskurd suppose\r\nthat the words, “the son of Orodes,” are omitted after “Pacorus” above,\r\nand “his” in the translation would then refer to Orodes.\r\n\r\n[544] See b. vi. c. iv. § 2, in which the motives for getting rid of\r\nthese members of his family are not mentioned.\r\n\r\n[545] Judging from Arrian (Anab. v. § 25; vii. § 9; iii. § 8), the\r\nhistorians of Alexander, as well as more ancient authors, gave the name\r\nof Syria to all the country comprehended between the Tigris and the\r\nMediterranean. The part to the east of the Euphrates, afterwards named\r\nMesopotamia, was called “Syria between the rivers;” that to the west was\r\ncalled by the general name Cœle-Syria, and although Phœnicia and\r\nPalestine were sometimes separated from it, yet it often comprehended\r\nthe whole country as far as Egypt. Strabo below, c. ii. § 21, refers to\r\nthis ancient division, when he says that the name Cœle-Syria extends to\r\nthe whole country as far as Egypt and Arabia, although in its peculiar\r\nacceptation it applied only to the valley between Libanus and\r\nAntilibanus.\r\n\r\n[546] B. C. 70.\r\n\r\n[547] Antakieh.\r\n\r\n[548] Modern conjecture has identified it with Shogh and Divertigi.\r\n\r\n[549] Kulat-el-Mudik.\r\n\r\n[550] Ladikiyeh.\r\n\r\n[551] Mesopotamia in the text is no doubt an error of the copyist. We\r\nought probably to read Commagene. Groskurd proposes to read “Commagene,\r\nlike Mesopotamia, consisted of one satrapy.” Groskurd’s emendation of\r\nthe text is followed, although not approved of, by Kramer.\r\n\r\n[552] These four portions were no doubt formed by the four hills\r\ncontained within the circuit of Antioch. The circuit wall existed in the\r\ntime of Pococke. The detailed and exact description given of it by this\r\nlearned traveller, as also his plan of Antioch, agree with Strabo’s\r\naccount. _Pococke, Descrip. of the East_, ii. p. 190.\r\n\r\n[553] C. i. § 25.\r\n\r\n[554] Mount Soldin.\r\n\r\n[555] Orontes, or Nahr-el-Asy.\r\n\r\n[556] Beit-el-Ma.\r\n\r\n[557] B. xii. c. viii. § 19; b. xiii. c. iv. § 6.\r\n\r\n[558] Also Hierapolis, the modern Kara Bambuche.\r\n\r\n[559] Berœa owes its name to Seleucus Nicator, and continued to be so\r\ncalled till the conquest of the Arabs under Abu Obeidah, A.

The translation follows the proposed\r\ncorrections of Letronne and Kramer.\r\n\r\n[572] Shizar, on the Orontes.\r\n\r\n[573] Cæcilius Bassus was besieged twice in Apameia, first by C.\r\nAntistius, afterwards by Marcus Crispus and Lucius Statius Marcius.\r\nCassius succeeded in dispersing the troops of this rebel without much\r\ndifficulty, according to Dion Cassius, xlvii. 27.\r\n\r\n[574] Arethusa, now Restan, was founded by Seleucus Nicator. According\r\nto Appian, Pompey subdued Sampsiceramus, who was king of Arethusa. On\r\nthis account Cicero, in his letters to Atticus (ii. 14, 16, 17, 23),\r\ncalls Pompey in derision Sampsiceramus. Antony put Iamblicus, son of\r\nSampsiceramus, to death; but Augustus restored the small state of\r\nArethusa to another Iamblicus, son of the former.\r\n\r\n[575] The people of Emesa, now Hems.\r\n\r\n[576] Balbek and Kalkos.\r\n\r\n[577] This Ptolemy, son of Mennæus, was master chiefly of Chalcis, at\r\nthe foot of Libanus, from whence he made incursions on the territory of\r\nDamascus. Pompey was inclined to suppress his robberies, but Ptolemy\r\nsoftened his anger by a present of 1000 talents, which the Roman general\r\napplied to the payment of his troops. He remained in possession of his\r\ndominion until his death, and was succeeded by his son Lysanias, whom\r\nCleopatra put to death, on the pretext that he had induced the Parthians\r\nto come into the country. _Josephus, Bell. Jud._\r\n\r\n[578] One of the branches of Antilibanus.\r\n\r\n[579] This Alchædamnus is constantly called Alchaudonius, by Dion\r\nCassius, whom he calls the “Arabian dynast.” Falconer therefore inferred\r\nthat here we ought to read Ἀράβων instead of Ῥαμβαίων, but Letronne does\r\nnot adopt this reading, and supposes the Rhambæi may have been a tribe\r\nof the Arabians.\r\n\r\n[580] The text is here corrupt, and the passage, according to Kramer,\r\nprobably introduced into the text from a marginal note.\r\n\r\n[581] παραλία, but this is a correction for παλαιά, which Letronne\r\nproposes to correct for περαία, which is supported in § 13, below. The\r\npart of the continent opposite, and belonging to an island, was properly\r\ncalled Peræa, of which there are many examples. That part of Asia Minor\r\nwhich is opposite Rhodes was so called, b. xiv. c. v. § 11, as also the\r\ncoast opposite Tenedos, b. xiii. c. i. § 46. Peræa was also adopted as a\r\nproper name. Livy, xxxiii. 18.\r\n\r\n[582] Pococke places Paltus at Boldo; Shaw, at the ruins at the mouth of\r\nthe Melleck, six miles from Jebilee, the ancient Gabala.\r\n\r\n[583] Carnoon.\r\n\r\n[584] Ain-el-Hiyeh.\r\n\r\n[585] According to Pococke, the ruins of Aradus (Ruad) are half a mile\r\nto the north of Tortosa (Antaradus). It is remarkable that Strabo makes\r\nno mention of Antaradus, situated on the continent opposite Aradus;\r\nPliny is the first author who speaks of it. Probably the place only\r\nbecame of note subsequent to the time of Strabo, and acquired power at\r\nthe expense of some of the small towns here mentioned. Antaradus,\r\nreëstablished by Constantine, assumed the name of Constantia.\r\n\r\n[586] Sumrah.\r\n\r\n[587] Ortosa.\r\n\r\n[588] Carnus.\r\n\r\n[589] The resistance of the sea water to the ascent of the fresh water\r\nis cut off by this ingenious contrivance, and the fresh water rises\r\nabove the level of the sea through the pipe, by natural causes, the head\r\nor source of the spring being in the upper ground of the mainland. This\r\nfountain is now known by the name of Ain Ibrahim, Abraham’s fountain.\r\n\r\n[590] B. xiv. c. v. § 2.\r\n\r\n[591] Greego.\r\n\r\n[592] If the words of the text, φέρει δὲ καὶ, “it produces also,” refer\r\nto the lake, our author would contradict himself; for below, § 41, he\r\nsays that Jericho alone produces it. They must therefore be referred to\r\n“a hollow plain” above; and the fact that they do so arises from the\r\nremarkable error of Strabo, in placing Judæa in the valley formed by\r\nLibanus and Antilibanus. From the manner in which he expresses himself,\r\nit is evident that he supposed the Jordan to flow, and the Lake\r\nGennesaret to be situated, between these two mountains. As to the Lycus\r\n(the Nahr el Kelb), Strabo, if he had visited the country, would never\r\nhave said that the Arabians transported upon it their merchandise. It is\r\nevident that he has confused the geography of all these districts, by\r\ntransferring Judæa, with its lakes and rivers, to Cœle-Syria Proper; and\r\nhere probably we may find the result of his first error in confounding\r\nCœle-Syria Proper with Cœle-Syria understood in a wider meaning.

Isaiah xxiii. 12.\r\n\r\n[606] In B. v. c. iii. § 7, Strabo tells us that Augustus prohibited\r\nhouses being erected of more than 70 Roman feet in height.\r\n\r\n[607] Josephus (Antiq. Jud. xv. 4, § 1) states, that Mark Antony gave\r\nCleopatra all the coast of Phœnicia, from Eleutheria to Egypt, with the\r\nexception of Tyre and Sidon, which he left in the enjoyment of their\r\nancient independence. But according to Dion Cassius (liv., 7), Augustus\r\narrived in the East in the spring of the year 734, B. C., or eighteen\r\nyears before the Christian era, and deprived the Tyrians and Sidonians\r\nof their liberty, in consequence of their seditious conduct. It follows\r\ntherefore, that if Strabo had travelled in Phœnicia, he must have\r\nvisited Tyre before the above date, because his account refers to a\r\nstate of things anterior to the arrival of Augustus in Syria; and in\r\nthis case the information he gives respecting the state of the\r\nneighbouring cities must belong to the same date; but he speaks above (§\r\n19) of the order reëstablished by Agrippa at Beyrout, which was effected\r\nfour years after the coming of Augustus into Syria. We must conclude,\r\ntherefore, that Strabo speaks only by hearsay of the Phœnician cities,\r\nand that he had never seen the country itself. _Letronne._\r\n\r\n[608] Il. xxiii. 743.\r\n\r\n[609] Probably under Zenarchus of Seleucia, the Peripatetic philosopher\r\nwhose lectures he attended.

He\r\ngave it the name of Cæsarea, in honour of Augustus, and raised it to the\r\nrank of a city of the first order. The repairs of the ancient city, the\r\nTower of Strato, or rather the creation of the new city Cæsarea, took\r\nplace about eight or nine years B. C.; so that this passage of Strabo\r\nrefers to an earlier period.\r\n\r\n[616] Josephus (Ant.

C. 107, was\r\nsucceeded by Aristobulus, who took the title of king, this being the\r\nfirst instance of the assumption of that name among the Jews since the\r\nBabylonish captivity. Aristobulus, was succeeded by Alexander Jannæus,\r\nwhose two sons were Hyrcanus II. and Aristobulus II., successively kings\r\nof Judæa, B. C. 67, 68.\r\n\r\n[652] B.

Letronne attempts\r\nto explain the origin of the error. According to Josephus, the Peræa, or\r\nthat part of Judæa which is on the eastern side of the Jordan, between\r\nthe lake of Tiberias and the Dead Sea, contained a district (the exact\r\nposition of which is not well known, but which, according to Josephus,\r\ncould not be far from the Lake Asphaltites) called Silbonitis. The\r\nresemblance of this name to Sirbonis probably misled our author.\r\n\r\n[661] Specific gravity 1·211, a degree of density scarcely to be met\r\nwith in any other natural water.

The translator adopts Kramer’s suggestion of\r\nΘετταλίαν for θάλατταν in the text.\r\n\r\n[666] “The salting station,” on the lake of Gennesareth.\r\n\r\n[667] It has been a subject of dispute whether Herod was of Jewish or\r\nIdumæan origin.\r\n\r\n[668] Herod went to Rome B. C. 38, and obtained from the senate the\r\ntitle of king. In the dispute between Octavius and Antony, he espoused\r\nthe cause of the latter. Octavius not only pardoned him and confirmed\r\nhim in his title, but also added other cities to his dominions. B. C.\r\n18.\r\n\r\n[669] The chief promoters of the crimes of Herod were Salome his sister,\r\nwho desired to gratify her hatred; and Antipater, who aimed at the\r\nthrone. Herod, influenced by their misrepresentations, put to death\r\nMariamne his wife, Aristobulus her brother, and Alexandra her mother;\r\nalso his sons Aristobulus and Alexander, besides Antipater, a third son,\r\nwho had conspired against his life.\r\n\r\n[670] Augustus conferred on Archelaus the half of the kingdom of Herod\r\nwith the title of ethnarch, promising to grant the title of king, should\r\nhe prove worthy of it. The other half of the kingdom was separated into\r\ntwo tetrarchies, and divided between Philip and Antipas, two other sons\r\nof Herod.\r\n\r\n[671] Augustus not only confirmed to Salome the legacy made to her by\r\nHerod, of the towns Jamneia, Azoth, and Phasaëlis, but granted to her\r\nalso the royal palace and domains of Ascalon.\r\n\r\n[672] This was Archelaus, whose tyranny was insupportable. He was\r\naccused by the chief Jews and Samaritans before Augustus, who exiled him\r\nto Vienne, to the south of Lyons, where he died the following year, A.\r\nD. 7.\r\n\r\n[673] This refers to the journey of Philip and Antipas to Rome. At the\r\ndeath of Herod, Archelaus went to Rome, A. D. 2, to solicit the\r\nconfirmation of his father’s will, in which he had been named king. The\r\ntwo brothers, Antipas and Philip, also went there, and the kingdom of\r\nHerod was divided as above stated. After the exile of Archelaus, his\r\ndominions were administered by his two brothers.\r\n\r\nStrabo does not appear to have been acquainted with the history of the\r\ntwo brothers after their return to Judæa; for otherwise he would not\r\nhave omitted to mention the exile of Antipas. This tetrarch, it is\r\nknown, went to Rome A. D. 38, to intrigue against his brother, of whom\r\nhe was jealous; but he was himself accused by Agrippa of having\r\nintelligence with the Parthians, and was exiled to Lyons, A. D. 39.\r\n\r\n[674] C. i. § 21.\r\n\r\n[675] C. i. § 6.\r\n\r\n[676] C. iii. § 4.\r\n\r\n[677] The name Erythræan, or Red Sea, was extended to the whole of the\r\nArabian Gulf, to the sea which surrounds Arabia to the south, and to a\r\ngreat part of the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[678] The cape Harmozi, or Harmozon, is the cape Kuhestek of Carmania,\r\nKerman, situated opposite to the promontory Maceta, so called from the\r\nMacæ, an Arabian tribe living in the neighbourhood. This last promontory\r\nis now called Mocandon, and is the “Asaborum promontorium” of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[679] For a long period the Euphrates has ceased to discharge itself\r\ndirectly into the Persian Gulf, and now unites with the Tigris above 100\r\nmiles from the sea.\r\n\r\n[680] The reading followed, but not introduced into the text, by Kramer\r\nis that suggested by the corrections of Letronne and Groskurd, καὶ τὴν\r\nἈράβων παραλίαν παραπλεύσαντα καθ’ αὑτόν.\r\n\r\n[681] Peludje, at the entrance of the Gulf of Gran.\r\n\r\n[682] Heeren (Comment. Gotting. 1793. Vol. xi. pp. 66, 67) supposes that\r\nthis city was founded by Chaldæans solely for the purpose of a depôt for\r\nthe transit of goods to Babylon, the trade having for a long time been\r\nin the hands of the Phœnicians. He also conjectures that the most\r\nflourishing period of the town was when the Persians, for political\r\nreasons, destroyed the commerce of Babylon, and Gerrha then became the\r\nsole depôt for the maritime commerce of India.\r\n\r\n[683] El-Der.\r\n\r\n[684] The island Ormus, which before the year 1302 was called Turun or\r\nGerun, from which the Greeks formed the names Tyros, Tyrine, Gyris,\r\nGyrine, Ogyris, and Organa. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[685] Arek.\r\n\r\n[686] Besides the islands Tyre and Aradus, there existed even in the\r\ntime of Alexander, and near the present Cape Gherd, a city called Sidon\r\nor Sidodona, which was visited by Nearchus, as may be seen in his\r\nPeriplus. The Phœnician inhabitants of these places appear to have\r\nafterwards removed to the western side of the Persian Gulf, and to the\r\nislands Bahraïn, to which they gave the names Tylos, or Tyre, and\r\nAradus. The latter name still exists; it was from this place that the\r\nPhœnicians moved, to establish themselves on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and transferred the name of Sidon, their ancient capital,\r\nand those of Tyre and Aradus, to the new cities which they there\r\nfounded. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[687] As Nearchus in his voyage kept along the coast, this distance must\r\nnot be understood as so much to the south of Carmania in the open sea,\r\nbut as the distance from Cape Jask, the commencement of Carmania.\r\n\r\n[688] In Ptolemy, this island is called Vorochtha, now Vroct, or Kismis,\r\nor Dschisme.\r\n\r\n[689] ἡ καυσία, a broad-brimmed Macedonian hat.\r\n\r\n[690] Pliny, v. 21, mentions a place which he calls Massica, situated on\r\nthe Euphrates, near the mouth of a canal which communicated with the\r\nTigris near Seleucia. It is now called Masseib-khan, and is at a short\r\ndistance above Babylon, on the borders of the desert. I do not know\r\nwhether this is the Mæcene of Strabo. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[691] Strabo here refers to the marsh lakes now called Mesdjed Hosaïn,\r\nRahémah, Hour, &c. The Chaldæans whom he mentions occupied the country\r\nalong the banks of the Euphrates to the coast of the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[692] In Cashmir melons are now grown in the same manner. Humboldt\r\nremarks that the same contrivance is adopted in Mexico for the\r\ncultivation of vegetables.\r\n\r\n[693] Letronne here proposes to read Erythræan or Ethiopian Sea.\r\n\r\n[694] Mimosa Nilotica.\r\n\r\n[695] This is remarkable.\r\n\r\n[696] Carn Almanazil.\r\n\r\n[697] Mariaba was not the name of a city, but the title of a city\r\nacquired by the residence of their sovereigns. “Mariana oppidum,” says\r\nPliny, vi. 32, “significat dominos omnium.” The capital was called Saba,\r\nnow Sabbea; and the country in which it is situated is called Sabieh.\r\n\r\n[698] Yemen.\r\n\r\n[699] The people of Hadramaüt.\r\n\r\n[700] The extent was six times as large as the Delta.\r\n\r\n[701] Ailah, or Hœle, or Acaba-Ila.\r\n\r\n[702] C. ii. § 30.\r\n\r\n[703] The ruins are still visible at Abu-Keyschid.\r\n\r\n[704] Deire, or the “neck,” so called from its position on a headland of\r\nthe same name, was a town situated on the African shore of the straits\r\nof Bab-el-Mandeb, at their narrowest part.\r\n\r\n[705] The Troglodytica extended along the western side of the Arabian\r\nGulf, from about the 19th degree of latitude to beyond the strait.\r\nAccording to Pliny, vi. c. 34, Sesostris conducted his army as far as\r\nthe promontory Mossylicus, which I think is Cape Mète of the modern\r\nkingdom of Adel. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[706] The 60 and 200 stadia assigned to the straits refer to the two\r\npassages there to be found. The 60 stadia agree with the distance of the\r\neastern cape of Bab-el-Mandeb, the ancient Palindromos, to the island\r\nMehun; and the 200 stadia to the distance of this island from the coast\r\nof Africa. In this last interval are the six islands of which Strabo\r\nspeaks.\r\n\r\n[707] This passage has sometimes been mistaken to mean, that the region\r\nproducing myrrh and cinnamon refers to the southern coast of Arabia. Our\r\nauthor here speaks of the coast of Africa, which extends from the Strait\r\nof Bab-el-Mandeb to Cape Guardafui. This space in following the coast is\r\n160 or 165 leagues, which are equivalent to 5000 olympic stadia.\r\n_Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[708] The long and interesting passage from § 5 to the end of § 20 is\r\ntaken from Artemidorus, with the exception of a very few facts, which\r\nour author has taken from other sources, accompanied by observations of\r\nhis own. On comparing this fragment of Artemidorus with the extracts of\r\nAgatharchides preserved by Photius, and the description of Arabia and\r\nTroglodytica which Diodorus Siculus (b. iii. 31) says he derived from\r\nAgatharchides, we find an identity, not only in almost all the details,\r\nbut also in a great number of the expressions. It is, therefore, evident\r\nthat Artemidorus, for this part of his work, scarcely did anything more\r\nthan copy Agatharchides. Agatharchides, in his youth, held the situation\r\nof secretary or reader to Heraclides Lembus, who (according to Suidas)\r\nlived in the reign of Ptolemy Philometor. This king died B. C. 146. He\r\nwrote a work on Asia in 10 books, and one on Europe in 49 books; a\r\ngeographical work on the Erythræan Sea in 5 books; a treatise on the\r\nTroglodytæ in 5 books; and other works. He wrote in the Attic dialect.\r\nHis style, according to Photius, was dignified and perspicuous, and\r\nabounded in sententious passages, which inspired a favourable opinion of\r\nhis judgment. In the composition of his speeches he was an imitator of\r\nThucydides, whom he equalled in dignity, and excelled in clearness. His\r\nrhetorical talents also are highly praised by Photius. He was acquainted\r\nwith the language of the Ethiopians, and appears to have been the first\r\nwho discovered the true cause of the inundations of the Nile. See Smith,\r\nart. Agatharchides.\r\n\r\n[709] Ghela.\r\n\r\n[710] Kosseir.\r\n\r\n[711] Mouse Harbour, or Harbour of Venus.\r\n\r\n[712] Meleagrides.\r\n\r\n[713] Bender-el-Kebir.\r\n\r\n[714] Zemorget or Zamargat. The “Agathonis Insula” of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[715] Ptolemy Philadelphus.\r\n\r\n[716] About 12 feet.\r\n\r\n[717] The whole of this description is so vague that it would be\r\ndifficult to recognise the position of the places mentioned by Strabo\r\nwithout the assistance of scattered notices by other authors. The result\r\nof many comparisons leads me to fix upon 16° 58´ as about the latitude\r\nof Ptolemaïs Epitheras. Mount Taurus was 22 leagues higher up, and the\r\nharbour of the goddess Soteira 12 leagues beyond. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[718] Letronne translates Πτολεμαῒς πρὸς τῇ θήρᾳ as Ptolemaïs Epitheras;\r\nsee c. iv. § 4.\r\n\r\n[719] Tacazze, which however does not appear to have such a branch.\r\n\r\n[720] These islands are to the north of Arkiko.\r\n\r\n[721] Gulf of Matzua.\r\n\r\n[722] From the position here assigned to the fortress of Suchus, it is\r\nimpossible to place it at Suachem, as is commonly done. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[723] An island Stratioton is mentioned in Pliny vi. 29, as though he\r\nhad read in our author the word Στρατιωτῶν, “the island of soldiers.” As\r\nthe island of Strato is named only in this extract from Artemidorus, we\r\nmight be tempted to correct the text of Strabo by the text of Pliny. But\r\nas it is not certain that the two authors speak of one and the same\r\nisland, it is more prudent to make no change. _Du Theil._\r\n\r\n[724] I am not acquainted with this place. The ancients speak only of\r\none town of the name of Saba (c. iv. § 19). Was there a town Saba which\r\ngave its name to the Sabaïtic Gulf? but the one in question does not\r\nappear to have been situated there. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[725] B. C. 658.\r\n\r\n[726] The modern Senaar corresponds with the territory of the Sembritæ.\r\nSee also b. xvii. c. i. § 2. Herodotus, b. ii. 30.\r\n\r\n[727] Tacazze.\r\n\r\n[728] The Blue Nile.\r\n\r\n[729] ἀκροδρύων is expressed in the Periplus of Agatharchides by the\r\nwords τὸν καρπὸν π ί π τ ο ν τ α ἀ π ὸ τῶν δένδρων, “the fruit falling\r\nfrom the trees.” The Periplus adds another tribe, the Hylophagi,\r\n“wood-eaters,” who subsisted on the tender branches of certain trees.\r\nStrabo refers to them, b. xvii. c. ii. § 2, but without giving their\r\nname. The pods of the Lotus Zizyphus are eatable, and may here be meant.\r\n\r\n[730] Gymnetæ. Between the Spermophagi and the Creophagi, Agatharchides\r\nplaces another people called Cynegetæ. Strabo and Pliny do not mention\r\nthem; but the sort of life the Gymnetæ, of which they both speak, lead\r\nresembles that of the Cynegetæ or Cynegi of Agatharchides and Diodorus\r\nSiculus (iii. 25). It seems therefore that these two authors, as well as\r\nStrabo and Pliny, meant here to speak of one and the same tribe of\r\nEthiopian Gymnetæ, which might have been distinguished by the particular\r\nname of Cynegetæ, or Cynegi. _Du Theil._\r\n\r\n[731] Above, c. ii. § 37.\r\n\r\n[732] Milkers of bitches.\r\n\r\n[733] This Berenice was also surnamed Epi Dire, because it was nearer\r\nthe promontory Dire than the other cities of the same name. It is\r\nprobably Bailul, about 12 leagues to the north-west of Assab.\r\n\r\n[734] Assab or As-Sab.\r\n\r\n[735] Below, Artemidorus calls it the harbour of Eumenes, § 13.\r\n\r\n[736] Agatharchides, as quoted by Diodorus Sic. iii. 27, says expressly\r\nthat this bird is the ostrich. May it be the cassowary?\r\n\r\n[737] Groskurd supposes the name of this nation has been omitted in the\r\ntext, and proposes Acridophagi, or Locust-eaters.\r\n\r\n[738] According to Agatharchides and Diodorus Sic. iii. 28, the habit of\r\nliving on locusts produced a kind of winged louse in the interior of the\r\nbody; but this is denied by Niebuhr.\r\n\r\n[739] Above, § 4.\r\n\r\n[740] Pliny, xiii. 17; xv. 13.\r\n\r\n[741] Perhaps Zeila. Strabo is here describing the coast of the modern\r\nkingdom of Adel.\r\n\r\n[742] The Periplus of the Erythræan Sea indicates on this coast a place\r\ncalled Niloptolemæum, which appears to correspond with the mouth of the\r\nriver Pedra. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[743] Phleus schæoris. _Linn._\r\n\r\n[744] Daphnus Parvus of the Periplus of the Erythræan Sea.\r\n\r\n[745] Now Fellis or Fel, which signifies Elephant in Arabic.\r\n\r\n[746] I think that there is something here omitted and wanting in the\r\ntext of Strabo, as he seems to make Artemidorus say, that a little after\r\nMount Elephas we find the Horn, or the Cape of the South; for this last\r\nappellation appears to have been applied to Cape Guardafui. But this\r\ncape, from the time of Philadelphus, and consequently before the period\r\nin which Artemidorus wrote, was known by the name of the Promontory of\r\nthe Aromatics; this author therefore could not have confounded it with\r\nthe Southern Horn. I have already come to the conclusion that the\r\nSouthern Horn corresponds with the Southern Cape of Bandel-caus, where\r\ncommences the desert coast of Ajan, the ancient Azania, respecting which\r\nArtemidorus confesses that he was unable to procure any information. It\r\ntherefore appears to me, that the description which this author must\r\nhave given of the coast of Africa, from Mount Elephas to the Southern\r\nHorn, and which Strabo should have copied, is now wanting in the text.\r\nThis omission seems to have been noticed by some copyist, who thought to\r\nsupply it by naming again, to the south of Mount Elephas, the altars of\r\nPytholaus, Lichas, Pythangelus, and Leon, which Artemidorus had already\r\nspoken of, and which navigators meet with on the west, and before\r\narriving at Mount Elephas. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[747] The text of this paragraph is corrupt; but the reading followed is\r\nthat suggested in a note by Kramer.\r\n\r\n[748] λέων μύρμηξ. Agatharchides calls them μυρμηκολέων, and Ælian\r\nsimply μύρμηξ. What animal is intended by the name is uncertain. In b.\r\nxv. c. i. §44, the marmot seems to be described.\r\n\r\n[749] What the words ἐπὶ σειρὰν mean is doubtful. Casaubon supposes that\r\nsome words are wanting in the text; Groskurd proposes to read ἀπὸ\r\nκεφαλῆς ἐπὶ οὐρὰν, “from the head to the tail.”\r\n\r\n[750] The passage is corrupt, and some words are wanting to complete the\r\nsense. Groskurd proposes, “a span less.”\r\n\r\n[751] Pliny, viii. 29.\r\n\r\n[752] Ancient authors, under the name of Sphinx, generally describe the\r\nape, _Simia troglodyte_ of Gmelin. _Du Theil._\r\n\r\n[753] Simia innuus.\r\n\r\n[754] Simia cepus.\r\n\r\n[755] The spotted hyæna.\r\n\r\n[756] See b. xv. c. 1, §45.\r\n\r\n[757] The juice of the berries is a strong purge.\r\n\r\n[758] Above, § 5.\r\n\r\n[759] The bay of Heroopolis is the modern bay of Suez.

The “Saspirene insula” of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[763] Ras Mahomet, which terminates the south of the peninsula formed by\r\nthe two bays, the Ælanitic running up to Petra, and that of Heroopolis\r\nrunning up to Suez. The meaning of Strabo seems to be, that this cape is\r\nin a direction due south of Petra and Palestine.\r\n\r\n[764] There is a wide difference of opinion among geographers with\r\nregard to the position of this important tribe in the modern map of\r\nArabia. See Smith, art. Minæi.\r\n\r\n[765] The Maraneitæ appear to me to be the same people whom other\r\ngeographers call Pharanitæ, and who received their name from their\r\nproximity to Cape Pharan, now Ras Mahomet. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[766] Diodorus Siculus, iii. § 41, following Agatharchides, narrates the\r\nfact with greater precision. The Garindæi took advantage of the absence\r\nof the greater part of the Maraneitæ, and put to death those that\r\nremained. They then laid in wait for and massacred all those who were\r\nreturning from the festival.\r\n\r\n[767] Gulf of Akaba.\r\n\r\n[768] “Light vessels.” Diodorus Sic.\r\n\r\n[769] Thamud, formerly occupied by the ancient Thamudeni.\r\n\r\n[770] Shaur and Iobab?\r\n\r\n[771] Gibel Seik, Gibel el Hawene, and Gibel Hester.\r\n\r\n[772] The harbour of Charmothas seems to be the ancient Iambo, the\r\n“Iambia” of Ptolemy, which now, from the accumulation of soil, is more\r\nthan a day’s journey into the interior of the country. It is in a\r\nfertile territory. The Arabs call it Iambo el Nakel, or Iambo of Palm\r\nTrees, to distinguish it from the new Iambo situated on an arid soil on\r\nthe sea-coast. Al Charm, in Arabic, signifies a fissure or opening in\r\nthe mountains. It seems as if the Greeks had formed the name Charmothas\r\nfrom this word, mistaking the epithet given to the narrow entrance of\r\nthe harbour of Iambo for the name of the town itself. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[773] The Debæ occupied Sockia. The river which flows through the\r\ncountry is called Bætius by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[774] τὰ πλείω is Kramer’s correction for παλαιὰ.\r\n\r\n[775] Some are called by Diodorus Siculus, iii. 44, and Agatharchides,\r\nAsilæi and Casandres or Gasandres.\r\n\r\n[776] Instead of εὔομβρος, Groskurd reads πάμφορος, “produces\r\neverything,” following the fragments the Agatharchides and Diodorus Sic.\r\nb. iii 44.\r\n\r\n[777] Groskurd’s correction, σιδήρου for ἀργύρου, in the text, is\r\nadopted. But the passage is probably corrupt, and after σιδήρου we may\r\nread καὶ δεκαπλάσιον τοῦ ἀργύρου, “for ten times the quantity of\r\nsilver,” according to Bochart, and approved by Kramer.\r\n\r\n[778] The precise boundaries of Sabæa it is impossible to ascertain. The\r\narea we have presumed is comprised within the _Arabian Sea_ W., the\r\n_Persian Gulf_ E., the _Indian Ocean_ S., and an irregular line skirting\r\nthe desert, and running up in a narrow point to Idumæa N.

Saba.\r\n\r\nMilton appears to have been acquainted with the following passage from\r\nDiodorus Siculus, b. iii. 46, descriptive of Sabæa: “It is impossible to\r\nenumerate the peculiarities and nature of all these trees and plants, on\r\naccount of the surpassing variety and body of perfume which fall upon\r\nand excite the senses, in a manner divine and beyond description. The\r\nmariner, as he sails even at a distance along the coast, has his share\r\nof enjoyment; for when the breezes of spring blow from off the land, the\r\nfragrance of the trees and shrubs is carried down to the shore; nor is\r\nit of the kind with which we are acquainted, proceeding from old and\r\nstored aromatics, but fresh and in full perfection from new-blown\r\nflowers, striking the inmost sense.”\r\n\r\n[779] The same as Saba; see c. iv. § 2.\r\n\r\n[780] The above details derived from Artemidorus, and by him from\r\nAgatharchides, would not be found in Eratosthenes, who lived before the\r\ntime of Agatharchides.\r\n\r\n[781] We must not confound this measure with the 5000 stadia mentioned\r\nin c. iv. § 4. The distance here in question is that taken along the\r\nsouthern coast of Arabia from the straits to Kesem, the ancient Cane,\r\nthrough which passes now, as in former times, the greater part of the\r\nperfumes collected in Hadramaut and Seger. But this harbour is about the\r\nmiddle, and not at the extremity of the cinnamon-bearing country.\r\n_Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[782] Cardinal Noris places these facts in the year of Rome 730, and\r\nquotes, besides Strabo, the historian Josephus. In following the last\r\nauthor, the Cardinal places the death of Obodas in the prefecture of C.\r\nSentius Saturninus, about the year of Rome 740. After the death of\r\nObodas, Æneas, afterwards called Aretas, took possession of the kingdom\r\nof the Nabatæans. Upon this Syllæus, the late king’s minister, went to\r\nRome, and declared before Augustus that Æneas, or Aretas, had no right\r\nto the kingdom. How this corrupt minister was punished by Augustus may\r\nbe seen in Nicolas of Damascus and in Josephus. This Aretas must have\r\nreigned for a long time, to at least the last years of Tiberius. _Du\r\nTheil._ “The interest attaching to this expedition, which promises so\r\nmuch for the elucidation of the classical geography of Arabia, has\r\nhitherto served only still further to perplex it.” The author of the\r\narticle Marsyabæ in _Smith’s Dict. of Greek and Roman Geography_, where\r\nthe subject is discussed at some length.\r\n\r\n[783] Called also Arsinoë, b. xvii. c. i. § 25. It was near Heroopolis,\r\nor Suez.\r\n\r\n[784] Koft.\r\n\r\n[785] This name is variously written in manuscripts. If Negra be\r\nadopted, as by Letronne, it is not the same town as the city of the\r\nNegrani above mentioned, which was in the interior; but, as Kramer\r\nobserves, “Mire corrupta est hæc ultima libri pars.”\r\n\r\n[786] B. xvi. c. iv. § 2.\r\n\r\n[787] See above, § 2.\r\n\r\n[788] This reminds us of the prophet Elijah and John the Baptist.\r\n\r\n[789] Od. iv. 84.\r\n\r\n[790] This subject was discussed in b. i. c. ii. § 34.\r\n\r\n[791] B. xvi. c. iv, § 2 and § 14.\r\n\r\n[792] Genadil.\r\n\r\n[793] Assouan.\r\n\r\n[794] Thus Eratosthenes calculated, in following the windings of the\r\nNile, 12,900 stadia, which is 7900 stadia more than he calculated in a\r\nstraight line, as he made the distance between the same points (Meroë\r\nand Syene, b. ii. c. v. § 7) to be 5000 stadia. M. Falconer suspects\r\nthat there is an error in the text; but the error lies further off. I\r\nbelieve that it is attributable to Eratosthenes himself, and that that\r\ngeographer did nothing more than convert the days’ marches into stadia.\r\nAccording to Pliny, Timosthenes, commander of the fleet of Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, and consequently anterior to Eratosthenes, said that from\r\nSyene to Meroë was a march of 60 days; and this statement agrees\r\ntolerably well with that of Herodotus, who calculated 56 days’ march\r\nbetween Elephantina and Meroë, besides a small distance the extent of\r\nwhich he does not state.\r\n\r\nProcopius, a learned writer, estimates a day’s march at 210 stadia; and\r\nemployment of this value, in the whole course of his history, proves\r\nthat it was generally adopted. Now, if we multiply 60 by 210, we shall\r\nhave 12,600 stadia, and dividing 12,900 by 60, we have 215 stadia, or\r\nnearly the amount of a day’s march according to Procopius. I am\r\ntherefore of opinion that Eratosthenes did nothing more than multiply\r\n210 or 215 by the number of 60 days, furnished by Timosthenes; and as\r\nthe excessive length of 12,900 stadia could not agree with the 5000\r\nstadia, which he had calculated in a straight line for the same\r\ninterval, he imagined this great difference arose from the excessive\r\nwinding course of the Nile; consequently he supposed the Nile to change\r\nfrequently the direction of its course.\r\n\r\nThis opinion had its influence in the construction of Ptolemy’s map,\r\nwhich presents to us nearly all the inflexions which Eratosthenes\r\nimagined; in calculating the intervals of positions assigned by Ptolemy\r\nalong the river, we find a total of 1260 minutes; and adding about 1/6\r\nfor the small windings, we have a total of 1470 minutes, which are equal\r\nto 12,400 stadia of the module (700 to the degree) adopted by that\r\ngeographer.\r\n\r\nAccording to this hypothesis, the distance in Strabo will be thus\r\ndivided: Setting out from Meroë, the Nile runs,\r\n\r\n                                               days.\r\n   1. 2700 stadia to the north                 12·8\r\n   2. 3700 to the S. and S. W.                 17·6\r\n   3. 5300 to the N. 1/4 E.                    25\r\n   4. 1200 to the N.                            5·7\r\n                                              —————\r\n                                               61·1\r\n\r\nwhich nearly corresponds with the account of Timosthenes. The number of\r\ndays corresponds tolerably well with the distance given by the explorers\r\nsent by Nero for the discovery of Meroë: they reported the distance to\r\nbe 873 miles. If we divide this number by 60, we shall have for the\r\nday’s mean march 14·55 Roman miles, or 11·64 geographical miles, which\r\nis in fact the day’s mean march, according to Major Rennell. _Letronne._\r\n\r\nIn carefully measuring, upon a large map of Egypt in 47 sheets, the\r\ncourse of the Nile through all its windings, and with the compass opened\r\nto 1000 metres, I find—\r\n\r\n                                                                metres.\r\n   From the middle of Syene to Luxor in the ancient territory\r\n     of Thebes                                                  218,900\r\n   From Luxor to Becous situated at the point of the Delta      727,500\r\n   From Becous following the Damietta branch to that city       234,000\r\n                                                              —————————\r\n                                                              1,180,400\r\n\r\nThis measure reduced to mean degrees of the earth equals 637° 25´, and\r\nrepresents 5312 stadia of 500 (to the degree). I certainly did not\r\nexpect to find such an agreement between the new and the ancient\r\nmeasures. The periodic rising of the Nile, I think, must have produced,\r\nsince the time of Eratosthenes, some partial changes in the windings of\r\nthe river; but we must acknowledge that these changes, for greater or\r\nfor less, compensate one another on the whole.\r\n\r\nWe observe, moreover, as I have already often observed, that the use of\r\nthe stadium of 500 to the degree is anterior to the Alexandrine school;\r\nfor at the time of Eratosthenes the stadium of 700 was more particularly\r\nmade use of in Egypt. _Gossellin._\r\n\r\n[795] Although generally described as an island, it was, like\r\nMesopotamia, a district included between rivers: the city Meroë was\r\nsituated in lat. 16° 44´.\r\n\r\n[796] Tacazze.\r\n\r\n[797] Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue river.\r\n\r\n[798] See b. xvi. c. iv. § 8, and Herod. ii. 30, who calls the Sembritæ,\r\nAutomoloi, that is, persons who had voluntarily quitted their abode.\r\n\r\n[799] The Nile valley was parcelled out into a number of cantons,\r\nvarying in size and number. Each of these cantons was called a nome\r\n(νομὸς) by the Greeks, “præfectura oppidorum” by the Romans. Each had\r\nits civil governor, the Nomarch, who collected the crown revenues, and\r\npresided in the local capital and chief court of justice. Each nome too\r\nhad its separate priesthood, its temple, chief and inferior towns, its\r\nmagistrates, registration and peculiar creed, ceremonies and customs;\r\nand each was apparently independent of every other nome. At certain\r\nseasons, delegates from the various cantons met in the palace of the\r\nLabyrinth, for consultation on public affairs (b. xvii. c. i. § 37).\r\nAccording to Diodorus, the nomes date from Sesostris. But they did not\r\noriginate from that monarch, but emanated probably from the distinctions\r\nof animal worship; and the extent of the local worship probably\r\ndetermined the boundary of the nome. Thus in the nome of Thebaïs, where\r\nthe ram-headed deity was worshipped, the sheep was sacred, the goat was\r\neaten and sacrificed: in that of Mendes, where the goat was worshipped,\r\nthe sheep was a victim and an article of food. Again, in the nome of\r\nOmbos, divine honours were paid to the crocodile: in that of Tentyra, it\r\nwas hunted and abominated: and between Ombos and Tentyra there existed\r\nan internecine feud.\r\n\r\n   Ardet adhuc Ombos et Tentyra: summus utrinque\r\n   Inde furor vulgo, quod numina vicinorum\r\n   Odit uterque locus, cum solos credat habendos\r\n   Esse deos, quos ipse colit.\r\n\r\n   Juv. xv. 35.\r\n\r\nThe extent and number of the nomes cannot be ascertained. They probably\r\nvaried with the political state of Egypt. See _Smith_, art.

C. 616. The Memphite Nome rose into importance on the\r\ndecline of the kingdom of Thebaïs, and was itself in turn eclipsed by\r\nthe Hellenic kingdom of Alexandria. The village of Mitranieh, half\r\nconcealed in a grove of palm trees, about ten miles south of Gizeh,\r\nmarks the site of the ancient Memphis. The successive conquerors of the\r\nland, indeed, have used its ruins as a stone quarry, so that its exact\r\nsituation has been a subject of dispute. Major Rennell, however, brings\r\nincontestable evidence of the correspondence of Mitranieh with Memphis.\r\nIts remains extend over many hundred acres of ground, which are covered\r\nwith blocks of granite, broken obelisks, columns, and colossal statues.\r\nThe principal mound corresponds probably with the area of the great\r\ntemple of Ptah. _Smith._\r\n\r\n[840] The Egyptians say that the ox Mneyis is sacred to the sun, and\r\nthat Apis is dedicated to the moon. Ælian de Nat. Animal. ii. 11.\r\n\r\n[841] Saïs stood in lat. 30° 4′ N., on the right bank of the Canopic arm\r\nof the Nile. The site of the ancient city is determined not only by the\r\nappellation of the modern town Sa-el-Hadjar, which occupies a portion of\r\nits area, but also by mounds of ruin corresponding in extent to the\r\nimportance of Saïs, at least, under the later Pharaohs. The city was\r\nartificially raised high above the level of the Delta to be out of the\r\nreach of the inundations of the Nile, and served as a landmark to all\r\nwho ascended the arms of the river, from the Mediterranean to Memphis.\r\nIts ruins have been very imperfectly explored, yet traces have been\r\nfound of the lake on which the mysteries of Isis were performed, as well\r\nas of the temple of Neith (Athene) and the necropolis of the Saïte\r\nkings. The wall of unburnt brick which surrounded the principal\r\nbuildings of the city was 70 feet thick, and probably, therefore, at\r\nleast 100 feet high. It enclosed an area 2325 feet in length by 1960 in\r\nbreadth. Beyond this enclosure were also two large cemeteries, one for\r\nthe citizens generally, and the other reserved for the nobles and\r\npriests of the higher orders.\r\n\r\nSaïs was one of the sacred cities of Egypt: its principal deities were\r\nNeith, who gave oracles there, and Isis. The mysteries of the latter\r\nwere celebrated with unusual pomp on the evening of the Feast of Lamps.\r\nHerodotus (ii. 59) terms this festival the third of the great feasts in\r\nthe Egyptian calendar. It was held by night; and every one intending to\r\nbe present at the sacrifices was required to light a number of lamps in\r\nthe open air around his house. At what season of the year the feast of\r\nburning lamps was celebrated, Herodotus knew, but deemed it wrong to\r\ntell (ii. 62); it was, however, probably at either the vernal or\r\nautumnal equinox, since it apparently had reference to one of the\r\ncapital revolutions in the solar course. An inscription, in the temple\r\nof Neith, declared her to be the Mother of the Sun. It ran thus, “I am\r\nthe things that have been, and that are, and that will be; no one has\r\nuncovered my skirts; the fruit which I brought forth became the Sun.” It\r\nis probable, accordingly, that the kindling of the lamps referred to\r\nNeith, as the author of light. On the same night, apparently, were\r\nperformed what the Egyptians designated as the “Mysteries of Isis.” Saïs\r\nwas one of the supposed places of interment of Osiris, for that is\r\nevidently the deity whom Herodotus will not name (ii. 171), when he says\r\nthat there is a burial-place of _him_ at Saïs in the temple of Athene.\r\nThe mysteries were symbolical representations of the sufferings of\r\nOsiris, especially his dismemberment by Typhon. They were exhibited on\r\nthe lake behind the temple of Neith. Portions of the lake may be still\r\ndiscerned near the hamlet Sa-el-Hadjar. _Smith, Dict. of Greek and Roman\r\nGeography, Art._ Saïs.\r\n\r\n[842] The evil or destroying genius.\r\n\r\n[843] Suez.\r\n\r\n[844] Pharaoh Necho, under whom and in the execution of the work 120,000\r\nlabourers perished. Herod. ii. 158.\r\n\r\n[845] κλειστὸν ἐποίησαν τὸν Εὔριπον, “closed the Euripus.” Diodorus\r\nSiculus, i. 33, thus speaks of this same work. “Darius the Persian left\r\nthe canal unfinished, as he was informed by some persons, that by\r\ncutting through the isthmus he would be the cause of inundating Egypt;\r\nfor they pointed out to him that the Red Sea was higher than the level\r\nof Egypt. The second Ptolemy afterwards completed the canal, and in the\r\nmost convenient part constructed an artfully contrived barrier,\r\n(διάφραγμα,) which he could open when he liked for the passage of\r\nvessels, and quickly close again, the operation being easily performed.”\r\n\r\nThe immediate communication therefore between the sea and the canal was\r\ncut off by a lock; and as there must have been two, there would be a\r\nflux and reflux of water between them on the passage of vessels. This\r\nprobably suggested to our author the word Euripus, and is to be\r\nunderstood as applying to that portion of the canal included between the\r\nlocks. By the word Euripus is generally understood the channel between\r\nNegropont and the mainland, which is subject to an ebb and flow of the\r\nsea. The storing up of water, and the distribution of it for the\r\npurposes of irrigation, was no doubt well known to the Egyptians.\r\nDiodorus, b. i. 19, ascribes to Osiris the invention. “Osiris confined\r\nthe Nile by embankments on both sides, so that at the period of its\r\nrising it might not inconveniently spread over the country, but that, by\r\ngates (διὰ θυρῶν) adapted for the purpose, the stream might be gently\r\ndischarged as occasion required.\r\n\r\n[846] B. i. c. i. § 20.\r\n\r\n[847] Bubastis or Artemis, Diana.

M. Letronne is disposed to think that Hipparchus,\r\nEratosthenes, Ptolemy, and others borrowed from these sources.\r\n\r\n[852] “Sesoosis (Sesostris) raised two obelisks of hard stone, 120\r\ncubits in height, on which were inscribed the greatness of his power,\r\nthe amount of his revenue, and the number of the nations which he had\r\nconquered. At Memphis, in the temple of Vulcan, he erected monolithe\r\nimages of himself and his wife, 30 cubits in height, and images of his\r\nsons, 20 cubits in height,” in memory of his escape from fire when his\r\nbrother Armais attempted to burn him with his wife and children.

Herodotus and Diodorus\r\nSiculus enter into more particulars, and in general are more exact. Some\r\nidea of the immense labour required may be obtained from considerations\r\nsuch as follow:—\r\n\r\nThe base and height being given, we find for the solid contents—\r\n\r\n                              cubic yards.\r\n   1. of the great pyramid      2,864,000\r\n   2. of Chephren               2,056,000\r\n   3. of Mycerinus                211,000\r\n\r\nSo that if a wall of (three metres) about 9-1/4 feet in height, and a\r\nfoot in thickness, were built with the materials of these pyramids, we\r\nshould have a wall—\r\n\r\n                                           miles.\r\n   1. from the great pyramid in length      1626\r\n   2. from Chephren or Cheops               1167\r\n   3. from Mycerinus                         117\r\n\r\nThe stones, therefore, of the three pyramids would form such a wall 2910\r\nmiles in length, or one sufficient to reach from Alexandreia to the\r\ncoast of Guinea. _Letronne._\r\n\r\n[855] This is a palpable error, and greater than that of Herodotus, who\r\nmakes the base equal to the height. The ratio of the height to the base\r\nin the great pyramid was as 0·627 to 1; and in the second, as 0·640 to\r\n1. Diodorus approaches nearest of all to the truth, as he makes this\r\nratio to be as 6 to 7 or as 0·817 to 1. Strabo should rather have said,\r\n“the sides are rather greater than the height;” but all that he says\r\nrespecting the pyramids is vague and inexact.\r\n\r\n[856] ἐν ὕψει μέσως πως μιᾶς τῶν πλευρῶν· μιᾶς is adopted, although not\r\nintroduced into the text, by Kramer; μέσως πως is connected with ἐν\r\nὕψει, and not with τῶν πλευρῶν, in the sense of “moderately,” in which\r\nit is also used in b. xi. c. ii. § 18. “The kings who succeeded to the\r\npossession of the country, (μέσως ἔπραττον) were moderately successful.”\r\nThe moveable stone has been taken away, and the aperture is at most at\r\nabout one-twelfth the whole height of the pyramid from its base.\r\n\r\n[857] Chembes the Memphite built the largest of the three pyramids,\r\nwhich are reckoned among the seven most remarkable works in the world.\r\nThey are situated by the side of Libya, distant 120 stadia from Memphis,\r\nand 45 from the Nile. These works, by their size and by the artifice and\r\nlabour employed in their construction, strike the beholder with\r\nastonishment and wonder. The base of the largest, the plan of which is\r\nquadrilateral, is seven plethra on each side; the height is more than\r\nsix plethra; the pyramid gradually contracts towards the top, of which\r\neach side measures six cubits, and the whole is built of hard stone. Its\r\nconstruction must have been accompanied with great difficulty, but its\r\npermanence will be eternal; for although, it is said, not less than a\r\nthousand years have passed away to our day (some even say more than 3400\r\nyears) since they were built, yet the stones still remain, preserving\r\ntheir original position, and their whole arrangement uninjured by time.\r\nThe stone is said to have come from a great distance in Arabia, and the\r\nprocess of building was carried on by raising mounds of earth; for at\r\nthat period no machines had been invented. But it is most marvellous\r\nthat although such an immense undertaking has been completed, and the\r\nwhole country around is composed of sand, not a single trace remains of\r\nthe mounds raised, nor of the fragments of stone broken off by the\r\nworkmen: indeed the pyramids do not seem to have been raised by the\r\ngradual labour of man, but to have been placed by some divine hand in a\r\nmass, perfectly formed, down upon the surrounding sands. Some Egyptians\r\nundertake to narrate wondrous stories respecting them, such, for\r\ninstance, that the mounds above-mentioned were composed of salt and\r\nnitre, which melted away upon the rising of the river, and completely\r\ndisappeared without the intervention of human labour. But this cannot be\r\ntrue, for the same number of hands which constructed the mounds would be\r\nable to reduce them again to their former state; and 360,000 men, it is\r\nsaid, were employed in the undertaking. The whole was completed in a\r\nlittle less than twenty years.\r\n\r\nOn the death of this king, he was succeeded by his brother Chephren, who\r\nreigned 56 years. According to some writers, it was not a brother, but a\r\nson, named Chabryis, who was his successor. But all agree that the\r\nsuccessor, whoever he was, desired to imitate his predecessor’s\r\nconception, and built the second pyramid, which resembled the first in\r\nits artificial construction, but was inferior to it in size, the sides\r\nof the base being a stadium each in length.\r\n\r\nOn the greater pyramid is an inscription which states the amount\r\nexpended on herbs and radishes for the workmen, and it informs us that\r\n1600 talents were paid for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe lesser pyramid bears no inscription, and it has an ascent formed in\r\nit through an opening in one of the sides. But although the kings built\r\nthese pyramids for their own tombs, yet it has so happened that none of\r\nthem have ever been buried in them. For the population, in consequence\r\nof the misery to which these works exposed them, and of the cruelty and\r\ntyranny of the kings, were incensed against them as the causes of their\r\nsufferings; and moreover threatened to tear their bodies in pieces, and\r\nto cast them out with insult from their place of burial. Every king\r\ntherefore, on the approach of death, enjoined his relations to bury his\r\nbody secretly in a place undistinguished by marks.\r\n\r\nThese were succeeded by king Mycerinus, (whom some call Mecherinus,) son\r\nof the king who built the first pyramid. He designed to build a third,\r\nbut died before he accomplished it. Each side of the base of this\r\npyramid was three plethra in length, and fifteen tiers of the building\r\nwere raised of black stone like the Thebaic stone, but the rest was\r\nfilled up with a stone resembling that of the other pyramids. This work\r\nis inferior to the two former in size, but far surpasses them in\r\nartificial construction and in the expensiveness of the stone. On its\r\nnorthern side the name of Mycerinus is inscribed, as the person who\r\ncaused it to be built. He is said to have held in abhorrence the cruelty\r\nof his predecessors, and to have been ambitious of leading a just life,\r\nand beneficial to his subjects. He performed many actions by which he\r\ncalled forth the affection of his people towards him; and among others\r\nhe expended a great sum of money in public causes, rewarding the judges\r\nwho delivered upright judgments, which was not commonly the case.\r\n\r\nThere are three other pyramids, the sides of which are two plethra in\r\nlength; in workmanship they entirely resemble the others, except in\r\nmagnitude. These pyramids, it is said, were built by the three\r\nbefore-mentioned kings in honour of their own wives. These works by\r\nuniversal consent are the most remarkable in Egypt, not only in their\r\nponderous construction, but also in the art displayed. We ought, we are\r\ntold, to admire more the architects than the kings, who supplied the\r\nmeans, for the architects brought their designs to completion by force\r\nof mind and the influence of an honourable ambition, but the kings by\r\nthe power of that wealth which was their portion, or by injuries\r\ninflicted on others. There is no agreement whatever, either between the\r\nnatives of the country or between authors, respecting the pyramids; for\r\nsome assert that the kings before mentioned built them, others that they\r\nwere not the builders, but that Armæus built the first and largest;\r\nAmasis, the second; and Inaro, the third: but this last is said by some\r\nto be the burial-place of Rhodopis, a courtesan, whose lovers were\r\ncertain governors of nomes, who from affection towards her undertook\r\nthis great work, and completed at their common charge. Diodorus Siculus,\r\nb. i. 63, 64.\r\n\r\n[858] Niebuhr says, that in these stones are found small petrified\r\nsubstances in the form of lentils, which appear to be of the same kind\r\nof shell of which he collected several at Bushir. Clarke also says, that\r\nat the base of the pyramids a variety of calcareous stone is found in\r\ndetached masses, exactly such as Strabo has described, and appear to be\r\nthe petrified remains of some unknown animal. Forskal calls them\r\n“testacea fossilia kakiensia.” Diodorus, as quoted above, says that\r\nthere are no vestiges of fragments.\r\n\r\n[859] The translation follows Letronne’s correction, ἐπέοικε for ἀπέοικε.\r\n\r\n[860] In the text λίθου πωρείας, Groskurd reads πωρίνου, which word\r\noccurs in Herod. v. 62, and translates it “tufstein.”\r\n\r\n[861] No passage is to be found in his Geography to this effect, it has\r\neither been lost from the text, or existed in his other works.\r\n\r\n[862] “It is said that the captives from Babylon revolted from the king\r\n(Sesostris), being unable to endure the sufferings to which they were\r\nexposed in the public works. They seized upon a strong place on the\r\nbanks of the river, and maintained for some time a contest with the\r\nEgyptians, destroying the neighbouring district. At last, having\r\nobtained security from molestation, they made a regular settlement of\r\nthe place, and called it Babylon, after their native city. Under similar\r\ncircumstances, it is said, a place received the name of Troy which still\r\nexists on the banks of the Nile. For Menelaus, on his return from Troy\r\nwith captives, came to Egypt. The Trojan captives revolted, took up a\r\nposition, and carried on a war, until having obtained safety for\r\nthemselves by treaty, they founded a city bearing the name of their\r\nnative place.” I am aware that Ctesias gives a different account of\r\nthese cities, and says that some of the soldiers who accompanied\r\nSemiramis in her invasion of Egypt founded these cities, and gave to\r\nthem the names of their native cities.

It is uncertain whether\r\nthe ruins at the village of Abuschaar, represent the site of the ancient\r\nMyos Hormus. See Smith’s Dict., art. _Myos Hormus_.\r\n\r\n[881] Il. ix. 383.\r\n\r\n[882] Il. ix. 381.\r\n\r\n[883] For θήκαις, “tombs,” in the text, Kramer is of opinion that we\r\nshould read Θήβαις, Thebes, which is also the translation of the passage\r\nby Guarini.\r\n\r\n[884] The meaning of the passage is clear, and can be understood, as\r\ncritics have already explained, only as implying the intercalation of a\r\n366th day every fourth year. Some have asserted that Julius Cæsar\r\nadopted this method of intercalating a day from the civil practice of\r\nthe Alexandrines; others, on the contrary, appear disposed to believe\r\nthat J. Cæsar was the first to give an idea of it, according to the\r\nadvice of Sosigenes. There is truth and error in both these opinions.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is certain that Strabo, who visited Egypt a short\r\ntime after the conquest of the country by the Romans, would not have\r\nomitted to attribute to them the institution of this year, if it really\r\nbelonged to them. So far from doing so, he says (above, § 29)\r\ndistinctly, that this method of intercalation was known and practised by\r\nthe priests of Heliopolis and Thebes. Diodorus Siculus, who visited\r\nEgypt just at the time of the first arrival of the Romans, gives the\r\nsame account as Strabo. Can we therefore believe that the Egyptians\r\nbefore this period were ignorant of the bissextile intercalation?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not less certain that this method of\r\nintercalation was only introduced into civil use at Alexandria from the\r\ntime of Julius Cæsar: before this period, the incomplete year of 365\r\ndays was adopted throughout the whole of Egypt, as is attested by a host\r\nof authorities, and confirmed by the date of the Rosetta stone, which\r\nonly applies to this method of reckoning. Hence we see (I.) that Julius\r\nCæsar really obtained the idea of a fixed year of 365-1/4 days from the\r\nEgyptians, where it was employed for scientific or religious purposes\r\nonly, whilst the incomplete year was the vulgar and common year; (II.)\r\nthat he made this fixed year the common year, both among the Romans and\r\nAlexandrines, who were a people most readily disposed to adopt foreign\r\ninnovations. It is, however, probable that the rest of Egypt preserved\r\nthe ancient use of the incomplete year.\r\n\r\n[885] Strabo, I think, is the only author who places Crocodilopolis and\r\nAphroditopolis in this part of Egypt. _Letronne._\r\n\r\n[886] For καὶ τῶν ἡμερῶν of the text, Casaubon reads τεκμηρίων, “signs.”\r\nCoray proposes καὶ μέτρων, “measures.” The expression in the text is\r\nobscure, and the translation is a conjecture of the meaning.\r\n\r\n[887] This was the general opinion of antiquity, and was reproduced by\r\nEratosthenes, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and others; in short, by all the\r\nAlexandrine school.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Eratosthenes, the obliquity of the ecliptic was 23° 45’\r\n17”. Syene was therefore 20’ 6” from being exactly under the tropic; for\r\n24° 5’ 23” (latitude of Syene)—23° 45’ 17” = 20’ 6”. This would be the\r\ndistance of the centre of the sun from the zenith of Syene; whence it\r\nfollows that the northern limb of the sun was about 5’ from it.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Strabo, the obliquity was only 23° 42’ 22”; the\r\ndifference between the zenith of Syene and the northern limb of the sun\r\nwas about 8’.\r\n\r\nLastly, about 140 of the vulgar era, the obliquity was reduced to 23°\r\n41’ 7”. Syene was then 24’ 16” from the tropic, and its zenith was about\r\n10’ from the northern limb of the sun; when the shadows of gnomons of\r\nany tolerable size must have been perceptible, and Syene could not have\r\nbeen any longer considered as lying under the tropic.\r\n\r\nAs regards the well which served to ascertain the instant of the\r\nsolstice, Pliny and Arrian both mention it. The formation of it no doubt\r\nbelonged to a very remote period. In the time of Strabo, the rays of the\r\nsun could not have reached entirely to the bottom, but the shadow was so\r\nsmall that it was not sufficient to shake the ancient opinion. In fact,\r\nthe angle being about 8’, and supposing the depth to have been 50 feet,\r\nthe northern side would have projected a shadow of about 18 lines; the\r\nrest would have remained in full light, and the reflexion would have\r\ncaused the whole circumference of the well to appear illuminated.\r\n_Letronne._\r\n\r\n[888] Kramer considers the passage between brackets to be an\r\ninterpolation, as the same sense is conveyed in the passage which\r\nimmediately follows.\r\n\r\n[889] The number here given is nearly twice too great. Kramer quotes G.\r\nParthey (de Philis insula) for correcting the error to 50 stadia, and\r\nfor perceiving that it arose from the very frequent substitution in\r\nmanuscripts of the letter P (100) for N (50).\r\n\r\n[890] Unhewn stones, with a head of Mercury upon them.\r\n\r\n[891] Herod. ii. 28, who, however, seems to doubt the veracity of his\r\ninformant.\r\n\r\n[892] Above, § 8.\r\n\r\n[893] B.

It is placed by the former\r\nbeyond Napata, and just above Meroë. Hence it is identified with Ibrim.\r\n\r\n[897] There is great difficulty in determining the true position of\r\nNapata, as our author places it much farther north than Pliny; and there\r\nis reason for supposing that it is the designation of a royal residence,\r\nwhich might be moveable, rather than of a fixed locality. Ritter brings\r\nNapata as far north as Primis and the ruins at Ipsambul, while Mannert,\r\nUkert, and other geographers, believe it to have been Merawe, on the\r\nfarthest northern point of the region of Meroë. It is, however,\r\ngenerally placed at the east extremity of that great bend of the Nile\r\nwhich skirts the desert of Bahiouda, and near Mount Birkel.\r\n\r\nAmong the ruins which probably cover the site of the ancient Napata are\r\ntwo lions of red granite, one bearing the name of Amuneph III., the\r\nother Amuntuonch. They were brought to England by Lord Prudhoe, and now\r\nstand at the entrance of the Gallery of Antiquities in the British\r\nMuseum.

He was put to death by Agathocles soon\r\nafter his arrival, and no Periplus of his said to have existed; his\r\ncourse also to Carthage was by land.\r\n\r\n[930] A people on the west coast of N. Africa, about the situation of\r\nwhom Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy are in perfect agreement with one\r\nanother, if the thirty days’ journey of Strabo between them and Lixus on\r\nthe west coast of Morocco, to the south of Cape Spartel, be set aside,\r\nas an error either of his information or of the text; which latter is\r\nnot improbable, as numbers in MSS. are so often corrupt. Nor is this\r\nmere conjecture, because Strabo contradicts himself, by asserting in\r\nanother place (b. xvii. c. 3. § 7) that the Pharusii had a great desert\r\nbetween them and Mauretania. When Ezekiel prophesies the fall of Tyre,\r\nit is said, (xxvii. 10,) “The men of Pheres (the common version reads\r\nPersia) and Lud and Phut were in thine armies.” These Pheres thus joined\r\nwith Phut, or Mauretanians, and the Ludim, who were nomads of Africa\r\n(the Septuagint and the Vulgate understand the Lydians), may be\r\nreasonably supposed to belong to the same region.

The continuous system of\r\nhighlands which extends along the coast of the Mediterranean was in the\r\nearliest period occupied by a race of people consisting of many tribes,\r\nof whom the _Berbers_ of the Algerine territories, or the _Kabyles_ or\r\n_Quabaily_, as they are called by the inhabitants of the cities, are the\r\nrepresentatives. These people, speaking a language which was once spoken\r\nfrom the Fortunate Islands in the west to the cataracts of the Nile, and\r\nwhich still explains many names in ancient African topography, and\r\nembracing tribes of quite different characters, whites as well as blacks\r\n(though not negroes), were called by the Romans Numidæ; not a proper\r\nname, but a common denomination from the Greek form, νομάδες. Afterwards\r\nNumida and Numidia became the name of the nation and the country.\r\nSometimes they were called Maurusii Numidæ, while the later writers\r\nalways speak of them under the general name of Mauri. The most powerful\r\namong these tribes were the Massyli, whose territories extended from the\r\nriver Ampsaga to Tretum promontory; and the Massæsyli, occupying the\r\ncountry to the west, as far as the river Mulucha. _Smith, Dict._ art.\r\nNumidia.\r\n\r\n[946] Cartagena.\r\n\r\n[947] Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[948] The words περιτραχήλια ξύλινα offer some difficulty. Paul Louis\r\nCourier, who is of authority on this subject, says that Strabo, having\r\nlittle experience in horses, has mistaken the first word for another,\r\nand intended to speak of the horse’s nose, and not his neck.

Cossura (the island Pantellaria) is nowhere\r\nelse spelt Corsura; Cossuros is the spelling observed immediately below.\r\nIts distance from Aspis is differently stated in b. vi. c. ii. § 11, to\r\nbe 88 miles from Aspis.\r\n\r\nÆgimurus is the small island Zembra, near Cape Bon; near it is also\r\nanother small low rocky island. From the shape and appearance of the\r\nformer, more especially in some positions, we may attribute the name Aræ\r\n(altars), given to them, as in Pliny: “Ægimuræ Aræ, scopuli verius quam\r\ninsulæ;” and they are the “Aræ” of Virgil, Æn. i. 108.\r\n\r\n[978] i. e. sacred to Mercury.

The position of Barca is accurately described by Scylax, who\r\nplaces its harbour 500 stadia from Cyrene, and 620 from Hesperides, and\r\nthe city itself 100 stadia from the sea. It stood on the summit of the\r\nterraces which overlook the west coast of the Greater Syrtis, in a plain\r\nnow called El-Merjeh; and the same name is often given to the ruins\r\nwhich mark the site of Barca, but the Arabs call them El-Medinah. See\r\nSmith, art. _Barca_.\r\n\r\n[1004] Ras-al-Razat or Ras Sem.

The doctrines that a subject only knows objects through the\r\nprism of the impression which he receives, and that man is the measure\r\nof all things, are stated or implied in the Cyrenaïc system, and lead at\r\nonce to the consequence, that what we call reality is appearance; so\r\nthat the whole fabric of human knowledge becomes a fantastic picture.\r\nThe principle on which it rests, viz. that knowledge is sensation, is\r\nthe foundation of Locke’s Modern Ideology, though he did not perceive\r\nits connexion with the consequences to which it led the Cyrenaïcs. To\r\nrevive these was reserved for Hume. _Smith’s Greek and Roman Biography\r\nand Mythology._\r\n\r\n[1012] This great astronomer and learned man, whose name so frequently\r\noccurs in the course of this work, was born about B. C. 276. He was\r\nplaced, by Ptolemy Euergetes, over the library of Alexandria. His\r\ngreatest work, and that which must always make his name conspicuous in\r\nscientific history, is the attempt which he made to measure the\r\nmagnitude of the earth, in which he brought forward and used the method\r\nwhich is employed to this day. See vol. i. page 9, of this translation,\r\nnote^{42}.\r\n\r\n[1013] Carneades was born about B. C. 213. In the year B. C. 155, when\r\nhe was fifty-eight years old, he was chosen with Diogenes the Stoic, and\r\nCritolaus the Peripatetic, to go as ambassador to Rome, to deprecate the\r\nfine of 500 talents, which had been imposed on the Athenians, for the\r\ndestruction of Oropus. During his stay at Rome, he attracted great\r\nnotice from his eloquent declamations on philosophical subjects, and it\r\nwas here that, in the presence of Cato the Elder, he delivered his\r\nfamous orations on Justice. The first oration was in commendation of\r\nvirtue; in the second justice was proved not to be a virtue, but a mere\r\nmatter of compact, for the maintenance of civil society. The honest mind\r\nof Cato was shocked at this, and he moved the senate to send the\r\nphilosopher home to his school, and save the Roman youth from his\r\ndemoralizing doctrines. He left no writings, and all that is known of\r\nhis lectures is derived from his intimate friend and pupil,\r\nCleitomachus.

The words in the original text, τοὺς κατ’ αὐτὸ μαλακῶς,\r\npresent the great difficulty; but Kramer reads τοῦ for τοὺς, and has\r\nadopted in the text Falconer’s proposed correction, κατ’ Αὐτόμαλά πως.\r\nThe name Augila is wanting in the text; it is supplied by Groskurd, and\r\napproved by Kramer, who refers to Herod. iv. 172, 182.\r\n\r\n[1022] Aujela, an oasis in the desert of Barca; it still retains its\r\nancient name, and forms one of the chief stations on the caravan route\r\nfrom Cairo to Fezzan.\r\n\r\n[1023] Τῆς καθ’ ἡμᾶς οἰκουμένης, Groskurd translates as inhabited to our\r\ntime; but Strabo refers to the then known world, having before, b. i. c.\r\niv. § 6, in a remarkable manner conjectured the existence of other\r\nhabitable worlds (such as America) in the latitude of Athens. “We call\r\nthat (part of the temperate zone) the habitable earth (οἰκουμένην) in\r\nwhich we dwell, and with which we are acquainted; but it is possible,\r\nthat in the same temperate zone there may be two or even more habitable\r\nearths, especially near the circle of latitude drawn through Athens and\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean.” The latitudes of Athens and Washington do not\r\ndiffer by one degree.\r\n\r\n[1024] B. vi. c. iv. § 2.\r\n\r\n[1025] B. ii. c. v. § 31.\r\n\r\n[1026] Guadalquiver (Wad-el-Kebir, the Great River).\r\n\r\n[1027] B. iv. c. i. § 6.\r\n\r\n[1028] B. iii. c. iv. § 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Aarassus, t. of Pisidia, ii. 324.\r\n\r\n   Aba, daughter of Zenophanes, iii. 56.\r\n\r\n   ——, Abæ, t. of Phocis, ii. 122, 151.\r\n\r\n   Abaïtæ, ii. 402.\r\n\r\n   Abaïtis, district of Phrygia, ii. 333.\r\n\r\n   Abantes (Eubœans), ii. 151.\r\n\r\n   Abantis (Eubœa), ii. 151.\r\n\r\n   Abaris, i. 463.\r\n\r\n   Abas, great-grandson of Erectheus, ii. 151.\r\n\r\n   ——, ii. 133.\r\n\r\n   Abdēra, t. of Thrace, i. 515;
