But a great many boys who\r\nbegan life by robbing birds'-nests have ended it much more\r\ncreditably. The astonishing and interesting element in Benedict\r\nArnold's career was what one might term the anomaly and incongruity\r\nof his treason. Born at Norwich, Conn., in 1741, he was blessed from\r\nhis earliest years by wholesome parental influences. The education\r\nwhich he received was an excellent one, considering his colonial\r\nenvironment. Tales of his boyish pluck and hardihood cannot be\r\ndisputed, while others that record his youthful cruelty are\r\ndoubtless the coinings of slander. It is certain that in 1755, when\r\nthe conflict known as \"the old French war\" first broke out, he gave\r\nmarked proof of patriotism, though as yet the merest lad. Later, at\r\nthe very beginning of the Revolution, he left his thriving business\r\nas a West India merchant in New Haven and headed a company of\r\nvolunteers. Before the end of 1775 he had been made a commissioned\r\ncolonel by the authorities of Massachusetts, and had marched through\r\na sally-port, capturing the fortress of Ticonderoga, with tough old\r\nEthan Allen at his side and 83 \"Green Mountain Boys\" behind him.\r\nLater, at the siege of Quebec, he behaved with splendid courage.\r\nThrough great difficulties and hardships he dauntlessly led his band\r\nto the high-perched and almost impregnable town. Pages might be\r\nfilled in telling how toilsome was this campaign, now requiring\r\ncanoes and bateaux, now taxing the strength of its resolute little\r\nhorde with rough rocks, delusive bogs and all those fiercest\r\nterrors of famine which lurk in a virgin wilderness. Bitter cold,\r\nunmerciful snow-falls, drift-clogged streams, pelting storms, were\r\nconstant features of Arnold's intrepid march. When we realize the\r\npurely unselfish and disinterested motive of this march, which has\r\njustly been compared to that of Xenophon with his 10,000, and to the\r\nretreat of Napoleon from Moscow as well, we stand aghast at the\r\npossibility of its having been planned and executed by one who\r\nafterward became the basest of traitors.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Quebec Arnold was severely wounded, and yet he\r\nobstinately kept up the blockade even while he lay in the hospital,\r\nbeset by obstacles, of which bodily pain was doubtless not the\r\nleast. The arrival of General Wooster from Montreal with\r\nreinforcements rid Arnold, however, of all responsibility. Soon\r\nafterward the scheme of capturing Quebec and inducing the Canadas to\r\njoin the cause of the United Colonies, came to an abrupt end. But in\r\nhis desire to effect this purpose Arnold had identified himself with\r\nsuch lovers of their country as Washington, Schuyler, and\r\nMontgomery. And if the gallant Montgomery had then survived and\r\nArnold had been killed, history could not sufficiently have\r\neulogized him as a hero. Soon afterward he was promoted to the rank\r\nof brigadier-general, and on October 11, 1776, while commanding a\r\nflotilla of small vessels on Lake Champlain, he gained new celebrity\r\nfor courage. The enemy was greatly superior in number to Arnold's\r\nforces. \"They had,\" says Bancroft, \"more than twice his weight of\r\nmetal and twice as many fighting vessels, and skilled seamen and\r\nofficers against landsmen.\" Arnold was not victorious in this naval\r\nfray, but again we find him full of lion-like valor. He was in the\r\nCongress galley, and there with his own hands often aimed the cannon\r\non its bloody decks against the swarming masses of British gunboats.\r\nArnold's popularity was very much augmented by his fine exploits on\r\nLake Champlain. \"With consummate address,\" says Sparks, \"he\r\npenetrated the enemy's lines and brought off his whole fleet,\r\nshattered and disabled as it was, and succeeded in saving six of his\r\nvessels, and, it might be added, most of his men.\" Again, at the\r\nbattle of Danbury he tempted death countless times; and at Loudon's\r\nFerry and Bemis's Heights his prowess and nerve were the perfection\r\nof martial merit. It has been stated by one or two historians of\r\ngood repute that Arnold was not present at all during the battle of\r\nSaratoga; but the latest and most trustworthy researches on this\r\npoint would seem to indicate that he commanded there with discretion\r\nand skill. He was now a major-general, but his irascible spirit had\r\npreviously been hurt by the tardiness with which this honor was\r\nconferred upon him, five of his juniors having received it before\r\nhimself. He strongly disliked General Gates, too, and quarrelled\r\nwith him because of what he held to be unfair behavior during the\r\nengagement at Bemis's Heights. At Stillwater, a month or so later in\r\nthe same year (1777), he issued orders without Gates's permission,\r\nand conducted himself on the field with a kind of mad frenzy, riding\r\nhither and thither and seeking the most dangerous spots. All concur\r\nin stating, however, that his disregard of life was admirable, in\r\nspite of its foolish rashness. In this action he was also severely\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nOne year later he was appointed to the command of Philadelphia, and\r\nhere he married the daughter of a prominent citizen, Edward Shippen.\r\nThis was his second marriage; he had been a widower for a number of\r\nyears before its occurrence, and the father of three sons. Every\r\nchance was now afforded Arnold of wise and just rulership. In spite\r\nof past disputes and adventures not wholly creditable, he still\r\npresented before the world a fairly clean record, and whatever minor\r\nblemishes may have spotted his good name, these were obscured by the\r\nalmost dazzling lustre of his soldierly career. But no sooner was he\r\ninstalled in his new position at Philadelphia than he began to show,\r\nwith wilful perversity, those evil impulses which thus far had\r\nremained relatively latent. Almost as soon as he entered the town he\r\ndisclosed to its citizens the most offensive traits of arrogance and\r\ntyranny. But this was not all. Not merely was he accused on every\r\nside of such faults as the improper issuing of passes, the closing\r\nof Philadelphia shops on his arrival, the imposition of menial\r\noffices upon the sons of freemen performing military duty, the use\r\nof wagons furnished by the State for transporting private property;\r\nbut misdeeds of a far graver nature were traced to him, savoring of\r\nthe criminality that prisons are built to punish. The scandalous\r\ngain with which he sought to fill a spendthrift purse caused wide\r\nand vehement rebuke. For a man of such high and peculiar place his\r\ncommercial dabblings and speculative schemes argued most deplorably\r\nagainst him. There seems to be no doubt that he made personal use of\r\nthe public moneys with which he was intrusted; that he secured by\r\nunworthy and illegal means a naval State prize, brought into port by\r\na Pennsylvanian ship; and that he meditated the fitting up of a\r\nprivateer, with intent to secure from the foe such loot on the high\r\nseas as piratical hazard would permit. His house in Philadelphia was\r\none of the finest that the town possessed; he drove about in a\r\ncarriage and four; he entertained with excessive luxury and a large\r\nretinue of servants; he revelled in all sorts of pompous parade.\r\nSuch ostentation would have roused adverse comment amid the simple\r\ncolonial surroundings of a century ago, even if he had merely been a\r\ncitizen of extraordinary wealth. But being an officer intrusted with\r\nthe most important dignities in a country both struggling for its\r\nfreedom and impoverished as to funds, he now played a part of\r\nexceptional shame and folly.\r\n\r\nNaturally his arraignment before the authorities of the State soon\r\nfollowed. The Council of Pennsylvania tried him, and though their\r\nfinal verdict was an extremely gentle one, its very mildness of\r\ncondemnation proved poison to his truculent pride. Washington, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, reprimanded him, but with language of exquisite\r\nlenity. Still, Arnold never forgave the stab that was then so\r\ndeservingly yet so pityingly dealt him.\r\n\r\nHis colossal treason--one of the most monstrous in all the records\r\nof history, soon afterward began its wily work. Under the name of\r\n_Gustavus_ he opened a correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton, an\r\nEnglish officer in command at New York. Sir Henry at once scented\r\nthe sort of villainy which would be of vast use to his cause,\r\nhowever he might loathe and contemn its designer. He instructed his\r\naide-de-camp, Major John André, to send cautious and pseudonymic\r\nreplies. In his letters Arnold showed the burning sense of wrong\r\nfrom which he believed himself (and with a certain amount of\r\njustice) to be suffering. He had, when all is told, received harsh\r\ntreatment from his country, considering how well he had served it in\r\nthe past. Even Irving, that most dispassionate of historians, has\r\ncalled the action of the court-martial just mentioned an\r\n\"extraordinary measure to prepossess the public mind against him.\"\r\nBeyond doubt, too, he had been repeatedly assailed by slanders and\r\nmisstatements. The animosity of party feeling had more than once\r\nwrongfully assailed him, and his second marriage to the daughter of\r\na man whose Tory sympathies were widely known had roused political\r\nhatreds, unsparing and headstrong.\r\n\r\nBut these facts are merely touched upon to make more clear the\r\nmotive of his infamous plot. Determined to give the enemy a great\r\nvantage in return for the pecuniary indemnity that he required of\r\nthem, this unhappy man stooped low enough to ask and obtain from\r\nWashington, the command of West Point. André, who had for months\r\nwritten him letters in a disguised hand under the name of John\r\nAnderson, finally met him, one night, at the foot of a mountain\r\nabout six miles below Stony Point, called the Long Clove. Arnold,\r\nwith infinite cunning, had devised this meeting, and had tempted the\r\nadventurous spirit of André, who left a British man-of-war called\r\nthe Vulture in order to hold converse with his fellow-conspirator.\r\nBut before the unfortunate André could return to his ship (having\r\ncompleted his midnight confab and received from Arnold the most\r\ndamning documentary evidence of treachery) the Vulture was fired\r\nupon from Teller's Point by a party of Americans, who had secretly\r\ncarried cannon thither during the earlier night. André was thus\r\ndeserted by his own countrymen, for the Vulture moved away and left\r\nhim with a man named Joshua Smith, a minion in Arnold's employ. Of\r\npoor André's efforts to reach New York, of his capture and final\r\npathetic execution, we need not speak. On his person, at the time of\r\nhis arrest, was found a complete description of the West Point post\r\nand garrison--documentary evidence that scorched with indelible\r\ndisgrace the name of the man who had supplied it.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 1780, Arnold escaped to a British sloop-of-war\r\nanchored below West Point. He was made a colonel in the English\r\narmy, and is said to have received the sum of £6,315 as the price of\r\nhis treachery. The command of a body of troops in Connecticut was\r\nafterward given him, and he then showed a rapacity and intolerance\r\nthat well consorted with the new position he had so basely\r\npurchased. The odium of his injured countrymen spoke loudly\r\nthroughout the land he had betrayed. He was burned in effigy\r\ncountless times, and a growing generation was told with wrath and\r\nscorn the abhorrent tale of his turpitude. Meanwhile, as if by\r\ndefiant self-assurance to wipe away the perfidy of former acts, he\r\nissued a proclamation to \"the inhabitants of America,\" in which he\r\nstrove to cleanse himself from blame. This address, teeming with\r\nflimsy protestations of patriotism, reviling Congress, vituperating\r\nFrance as a worthless and sordid ally of the Crown's rebellious\r\nsubjects, met on all sides the most contemptuous derision. Arnold\r\npassed nearly all the remainder of his life--eleven years or\r\nthereabouts--in England. He died in London, worn out with a nervous\r\ndisease, on June 14, 1801. It is a remarkable fact that his second\r\nwife, who had till the last remained faithful to him, suffered\r\nacutely at his death, and both spoke and wrote of him in accents of\r\nstrongest bereavement.\r\n\r\nTo the psychologic student of human character, Benedict Arnold\r\npresents a strangely fascinating picture. Elements of good were\r\nunquestionably factors of his mental being. But pride, revenge,\r\njealousy, and an almost superhuman egotism fatally swayed him. He\r\ndesired to lead in all things, and he had far too much vanity, far\r\ntoo little self-government, and not half enough true morality to\r\nlead with success and permanence in any. The wrongs which beyond\r\ndoubt his country inflicted upon him he was incapable of bearing\r\nlike a stoic. Virile and patriotic from one point of view, he was\r\nchildish and weak-fibred from another. He has been likened to\r\nMarlborough, though by no means so great a soldier. Yet it is true\r\nthat John Churchill won his dukedom by deserting his former\r\nbenefactor, James II, and joining the Whig cause of William of\r\nOrange. If the Revolution had been crushed, we cannot blind our eyes\r\nto the fact that Arnold's treason would have received from history\r\nfar milder dealing than is accorded it now. Even the radiant name of\r\nWashington would very probably have shone to us dimmed and blurred\r\nthrough a mist of calamity. Posterity may respect the patriot whose\r\nstar sinks in unmerited failure, but it bows homage to him if he\r\nwages against despotism a victorious fight. Supposing that Arnold's\r\nsurrender of West Point had extinguished that splendid spark of\r\nliberty which glowed primarily at Lexington and Bunker Hill, the\r\nchances are that he might have received an English peerage and died\r\nin all the odor of a distinction as brilliant as it would have been\r\nundeserved. The triumph of the American rebellion so soon after he\r\nhad ignominiously washed his hands of it, sealed forever his own\r\nsocial doom. That, it is certain, was most severe and drastic. The\r\nmoney paid him by the British Government was accursed as were the\r\nthirty silver pieces of Iscariot; for his passion to speculate\r\nruined him financially some time before the end of his life, and he\r\nbreathed his last amid comparative poverty and the dread of still\r\ndarker reverses.\r\n\r\nExtreme sensitiveness is apt to accompany a spirit of just his\r\nhigh-strung, petulant, and spleenful sort. Beyond doubt he must have\r\nsuffered keen torments at the disdain with which he was everywhere\r\nmet in English society, and chiefly among the military officers whom\r\nhis very conduct, renegade though it was, had in a measure forced to\r\nrecognize him. When Lord Cornwallis gave his sword to Washington,\r\nits point pierced Arnold's breast with a wound rankling and\r\nincurable. He had played for high stakes with savage and devilish\r\ndesperation. Our national independence meant his future slavery; our\r\npriceless gain became his irretrievable loss. It is stated that as\r\ndeath approached him he grew excessively anxious about the risky and\r\nshattered state of his affairs. His mind wandered, as Mrs. Arnold\r\nwrites, and he fancied himself once more fighting those battles\r\nwhich had brought him honor and fame. It was then that he would call\r\nfor his old insignia of an American soldier and would desire to be\r\nagain clothed in them. \"Bring me, I beg of you,\" he is reported to\r\nhave said, \"the epaulettes and sword-knots which Washington gave me.\r\nLet me die in my old American uniform, the uniform in which I fought\r\nmy battles!\" And once, it is declared, he gave vent to these most\r\nsignificant and terrible words: \"God forgive me for ever putting on\r\nany other!\" That country which he forswore in the hour of its direst\r\nneed can surely afford to forgive Benedict Arnold as well. Grown the\r\ngreatest republic of which history keeps any record, America need\r\nnot find it difficult both to forget the wretched frailties of this,\r\nher grossly misguided son, and at the same time to remember what\r\nservices he performed for her while as yet his baleful qualities had\r\nnot swept beyond all bounds of restraint.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Edgar Fawcett.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATHAN HALE[2]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 2: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy Rev.

When but little more than\r\ntwenty-one years old he was hanged, by order of General William\r\nHowe, as a spy, in the city of New York, on September 22, 1776.\r\n\r\nAt the great centennial celebration of the Revolution, and the part\r\nwhich the State of Connecticut bore in it, an immense assembly of\r\nthe people of Connecticut, on the heights of Groton, took measures\r\nfor the erection of a statue in Hale's honor. Their wish has been\r\ncarried out by their agents in the government of the State. A bronze\r\nstatue of Hale is in the State Capitol. Another bronze statue of him\r\nhas been erected in the front of the Wadsworth Athenæum in Hartford.\r\nAnother is in the city of New York.\r\n\r\nNathan Hale's father was Richard Hale, who had emigrated to\r\nCoventry, from Newbury, Mass., in 1746, and had married Elizabeth,\r\nthe daughter of Joseph Strong. By her he had twelve children, of\r\nwhom Nathan was the sixth.\r\n\r\nRichard Hale was a prosperous and successful farmer. He sent to Yale\r\nCollege at one time his two sons, Enoch and Nathan, who had been\r\nborn within two years of each other. This college was then under the\r\ndirection of Dr. Daggett. Both the young men enjoyed study, and\r\nNathan Hale, at the exercises of Commencement Day took what is\r\ncalled a part, which shows that he was among the thirteen scholars\r\nof highest rank in his class.\r\n\r\nFrom the record of the college society to which he belonged, it\r\nappears that he was interested in their theatrical performances.\r\nThese were not discouraged by the college government, and made a\r\nrecognized part of the amusements of the college and the town. Many\r\nof the lighter plays brought forward on the English stage were thus\r\nproduced by the pupils of Yale College for the entertainment of the\r\npeople of New Haven.\r\n\r\nWhen he graduated, at the age of eighteen, he probably intended at\r\nsome time to become a Christian minister, as his brother Enoch did.\r\nBut, as was almost a custom of the time, he began his active life as\r\na teacher in the public schools, and early in 1774 accepted an\r\nappointment as the teacher of the Union Grammar School, a school\r\nmaintained by the gentlemen of New London, Conn., for the higher\r\neducation of their children. Of thirty-two pupils, he says, \"ten are\r\nLatiners and all but one of the rest are writers.\"\r\n\r\nIn his commencement address Hale had considered the question whether\r\nthe higher education of women were not neglected. And, in the\r\narrangement of the Union School at New London, it was determined\r\nthat between the hours of five and seven in the morning, he should\r\nteach a class of \"twenty young ladies\" in the studies which occupied\r\ntheir brothers at a later hour.\r\n\r\nHe was thus engaged in the year 1774. The whole country was alive\r\nwith the movements and discussions which came to a crisis in the\r\nbattle of Lexington the next year. Hale, though not of age, was\r\nenrolled in the militia and was active in the military organization\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the news of Lexington and Concord reached New London, a\r\ntown-meeting was called. At this meeting, this young man, not yet of\r\nage, was one of the speakers. \"Let us march immediately,\" he said,\r\n\"and never lay down our arms until we obtain our independence.\" He\r\nassembled his school as usual the next day, but only to take leave\r\nof his scholars. \"He gave them earnest counsel, prayed with them,\r\nshook each by the hand,\" and bade them farewell.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there is no other record so early as this in which\r\nthe word \"independence\" was publicly spoken. It would seem as if the\r\nuncalculating courage of a boy of twenty were needed to break the\r\nspell which still gave dignity to colonial submission.\r\n\r\nHe was commissioned as First Lieutenant in the Seventh Connecticut\r\nregiment, and resigned his place as teacher. The first duty assigned\r\nto the regiment was in the neighborhood of New London, where,\r\nprobably, they were perfecting their discipline. On September 14,\r\n1775, they were ordered by Washington to Cambridge. There they were\r\nplaced on the left wing of his army, and made their camp at the foot\r\nof Winter Hill. This was the post which commanded the passage from\r\nCharlestown, one of the only two roads by which the English could\r\nmarch out from Boston. Here they remained until the next spring.\r\nHale himself gives the most interesting details of that great\r\nvictory by which Washington and his officers changed that force of\r\nminute-men, by which they had overawed Boston in 1775, into a\r\nregular army. Hale re-enlisted as many of the old men as possible,\r\nand then went back to Coventry to engage, from his old school\r\ncompanions, soldiers for the war. After a month of such effort at\r\nhome, he came back with a body of recruits to Roxbury.\r\n\r\nOn January 30th his regiment was removed to the right wing in\r\nRoxbury. Here they joined in the successful night enterprise of\r\nMarch 4th and 5th, by which the English troops were driven from\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the English army had left the country, Washington knew\r\nthat their next point of attack would be New York. Most of his army\r\nwas, therefore, sent there, and Webb's regiment among the rest. They\r\nwere at first assigned to the Canada army, but because they had a\r\ngood many seafaring men, were reserved for service near New York,\r\nwhere their \"web-footed\" character served them well more than once\r\nthat summer. Hale marched with the regiment to New London, whence\r\nthey all went by water to New York. On that critical night, when the\r\nwhole army was moved across to New York after the defeat at\r\nBrooklyn, the regiment rendered effective service.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that Hale planned an attack, made by members\r\nof his own company, to set fire to the frigate Phoenix. The frigate\r\nwas saved, but one of her tenders and four cannons and six swivels\r\nwere taken. The men received the thanks, praises, and rewards of\r\nWashington, and the frigate, with her companions, not caring to risk\r\nsuch attacks again, retired to the Narrows. Soon after this little\r\nbrush with the enemy, Colonel Knowlton, of one of the Connecticut\r\nregiments, organized a special corps, which was known as Knowlton's\r\nRangers. On the rolls of their own regiments the officers and men\r\nare spoken of as \"detached on command.\" They received their orders\r\ndirect from Washington and Putnam, and were kept close in front of\r\nthe enemy, watching his movements from the American line in Harlem.\r\nIt was in this service, on September 15th, that Knowlton's Rangers,\r\nwith three Virginia companies, drove the English troops from their\r\nposition in an open fight. It was a spirited action, which was a\r\nreal victory for the attacking force. Knowlton and Leitch, the\r\nleaders, were both killed. In his general orders Washington spoke of\r\nKnowlton as a gallant and brave officer who would have been an honor\r\nto any country.\r\n\r\nBut Hale, alas! was not fighting at Knowlton's side. He was indeed\r\n\"detached for special service.\" Washington had been driven up the\r\nisland of New York, and was holding his place with the utmost\r\ndifficulty. On September 6th he wrote, \"We have not been able to\r\nobtain the least information as to the enemy's plans.\" In sheer\r\ndespair at the need of better information than the Tories of New\r\nYork City would give him, the great commander consulted his council,\r\nand at their direction summoned Knowlton to ask for some volunteer\r\nof intelligence, who would find his way into the English lines, and\r\nbring back some tidings that could be relied upon. Knowlton summoned\r\na number of officers, and stated to them the wishes of their great\r\nchief. The appeal was received with dead silence. It is said that\r\nKnowlton personally addressed a non-commissioned officer, a\r\nFrenchman, who was an old soldier. He did so only to receive the\r\nnatural reply, \"I am willing to be shot, but not to be hung.\"\r\nKnowlton felt that he must report his failure to Washington. But\r\nNathan Hale, his youngest captain, broke the silence. \"I will\r\nundertake it,\" he said. He had come late to the meeting. He was pale\r\nfrom recent sickness. But he saw an opportunity to serve, and he did\r\nthe duty which came next his hand.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hull, afterward the major-general who commanded at Detroit,\r\nhad been Hale's college classmate. He remonstrated with his friend\r\non the danger of the task, and the ignominy which would attend its\r\nfailure. \"He said to him that it was not in the line of his duty,\r\nand that he was of too frank and open a temper to act successfully\r\nthe part of a spy, or to face its dangers, which would probably lead\r\nto a disgraceful death.\" Hale replied, \"I wish to be useful, and\r\nevery kind of service necessary to the public good becomes honorable\r\nby being necessary. If the exigencies of my country demand a\r\npeculiar service, its claims to perform that service are imperious.\"\r\nThese are the last words of his which can be cited until those which\r\nhe spoke at the moment of his death. He promised Hull to take his\r\narguments into consideration, but Hull never heard from him again.\r\n\r\nIn the second week of September he left the camp for Stamford with\r\nStephen Hempstead, a sergeant in Webb's regiment, from whom we have\r\nthe last direct account of his journey. With Hempstead and Asher\r\nWright, who was his servant in camp, he left his uniform and some\r\nother articles of property. He crossed to Long Island in citizen's\r\ndress, and, as Hempstead thought, took with him his college diploma,\r\nmeaning to assume the aspect of a Connecticut schoolmaster visiting\r\nNew York in the hope to establish himself. He landed near\r\nHuntington, or Oyster Bay, and directed the boatman to return at a\r\ntime fixed by him, the 20th of September. He made his way into New\r\nYork, and there, for a week or more apparently, prosecuted his\r\ninquiries. He returned on the day fixed, and awaited his boat. It\r\nappeared, as he thought; and he made a signal from the shore. Alas!\r\nhe had mistaken the boat. She was from an English frigate, which lay\r\nscreened by a point of woods, and had come in for water. Hale\r\nattempted to retrace his steps, but was too late. He was seized and\r\nexamined. Hidden in the soles of his shoes were his memoranda, in\r\nthe Latin language. They compromised him at once. He was carried on\r\nboard the frigate, and sent to New York the same day, well guarded.\r\n\r\nIt was at an unfortunate moment, if anyone expected tenderness from\r\nGeneral Howe. Hale landed while the city was in the tenor of the\r\ngreat conflagration of September 21st. In that fire nearly a quarter\r\nof the town was burned down. The English supposed, rightly or not,\r\nthat the fire had been begun by the Americans. The bells had been\r\ntaken from the churches by order of the Provincial Congress. The\r\nfire-engines were out of order, and for a time it seemed impossible\r\nto check the flames. Two hundred persons were sent to jail upon the\r\nsupposition that they were incendiaries. It is in the midst of such\r\nconfusion that Hale is taken to General Howe's head-quarters, and\r\nthere he meets his doom.\r\n\r\nNo testimony could be stronger against him than the papers on his\r\nperson. He was not there to prevaricate, and he told them his rank\r\nand name. There was no trial, and Howe at once ordered that he\r\nshould be hanged the next morning. Worse than this, had he known it,\r\nhe was to be hanged by William Cunningham, the Provost-Major, a man\r\nwhose brutality, through the war disgraced the British army. It is a\r\nsatisfaction to know that Cunningham was hanged for his deserts in\r\nEngland, not many years after.[3]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 3: Such is the current tradition and belief, that\r\n         he was hanged at Newgate; but Mr. George Bancroft found no\r\n         such name in the records of the prison.]\r\n\r\nHale was confined for the night of September 21st in the greenhouse\r\nof the garden of Howe's head-quarters. This place was known as the\r\nBeckman Mansion, at Turtle Bay. This house was standing until within\r\na few years.\r\n\r\nEarly the next day he was led to his death. \"On the morning of the\r\nexecution,\" said Captain Montresor, an English officer, \"my station\r\nbeing near the fatal spot, I requested the Provost-Marshal to permit\r\nthe prisoner to sit in my marquee while he was making the necessary\r\npreparations. Captain Hale entered. He asked for writing materials,\r\nwhich I furnished him. He wrote two letters; one to his mother and\r\none to a brother officer. The Provost-Marshal destroyed the letters,\r\nand assigned as a reason that the rebels should not know that they\r\nhad a man in their army who could die with so much firmness.\"\r\n\r\nHale asked for a Bible, but his request was refused. He was marched\r\nout by a guard and hanged upon an apple-tree in Rutgers's orchard.\r\nThe place was near the present intersection of East Broadway and\r\nMarket Streets. Cunningham asked him to make his dying \"speech and\r\nconfession.\" \"I only regret,\" he said, \"that I have but one life to\r\nlose for my country.\"\r\n\r\n[Signature: Edward E. Hale.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHADDEUS KOSCIUSKO\r\n\r\n(1746-1817)\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the remarkable men of modern times there is perhaps none whose\r\nfame is purer from reproach than that of Thaddeus Kosciusko. His\r\nname is enshrined in the ruins of his unhappy country, which, with\r\nheroic bravery and devotion, he sought to defend against foreign\r\noppression and foreign domination. Kosciusko was born at Warsaw\r\nabout the year 1746. He was educated at the School of Cadets, in\r\nthat city, where he distinguished himself so much in scientific\r\nstudies as well as in drawing, that he was selected as one of four\r\nstudents of that institution who were sent to travel at the\r\nexpense of the state, with a view of perfecting their talents. In\r\nthis capacity he visited France, where he remained for several\r\nyears, devoting himself to studies of various kinds. On his return\r\nto his own country he entered the army, and obtained the command of\r\na company. But he was soon obliged to expatriate himself again, in\r\norder to fly from a violent but unrequited passion for the daughter\r\nof the Marshal of Lithuania, one of the first officers of state of\r\nthe Polish court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thaddeus Kosciusko.]\r\n\r\nHe bent his steps to that part of North America which was then\r\nwaging its war of independence against England. Here he entered the\r\narmy, and served with distinction as one of the adjutants of General\r\nWashington. While thus employed, he became acquainted with\r\nLafayette, Lameth, and other distinguished Frenchmen serving in the\r\nsame cause, and was honored by receiving the most flattering praises\r\nfrom Franklin, as well as the public thanks of the Congress of the\r\nUnited Provinces. He was also decorated with the new American order\r\nof Cincinnatus, being the only European, except Lafayette, to whom\r\nit was given.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the war he returned to his own country, where\r\nhe lived in retirement till the year 1789, at which period he was\r\npromoted by the Diet to the rank of major-general. That body was at\r\nthis time endeavoring to place its military force upon a respectable\r\nfooting, in the vain hope of restraining and diminishing the\r\ndomineering influence of foreign powers in what still remained of\r\nPoland. It also occupied itself in changing the vicious constitution\r\nof that unfortunate and ill-governed country--in rendering the\r\nmonarchy hereditary, in declaring universal toleration, and in\r\npreserving the privileges of the nobility, while at the same time it\r\nameliorated the condition of the lower orders. In all these\r\nimprovements Stanislas Poniatowski, the reigning king, readily\r\nconcurred; though the avowed intention of the Diet was to render the\r\ncrown hereditary in the Saxon family. The King of Prussia (Frederick\r\nWilliam II.), who, from the time of the treaty of Cherson, in 1787,\r\nbetween Russia and Austria, had become hostile to the former power,\r\nalso encouraged the Poles in their proceedings; and even gave them\r\nthe most positive assurances of assisting them, in case the changes\r\nthey were effecting occasioned any attacks from other sovereigns.\r\n\r\nRussia at length, having made peace with the Turks, prepared to\r\nthrow her sword into the scale. A formidable opposition to the\r\nmeasures of the Diet had arisen, even among the Poles themselves,\r\nand occasioned what was called the confederation of Targowicz, to\r\nwhich the Empress of Russia promised her assistance. The feeble\r\nStanislas, who had proclaimed the new constitution in 1791, bound\r\nhimself in 1792 to sanction the Diet of Grodno, which restored the\r\nancient constitution, with all its vices and all its abuses. In the\r\nmeanwhile Frederick William, King of Prussia, who had so mainly\r\ncontributed to excite the Poles to their enterprises, basely\r\ndeserted them, and refused to give them any assistance. On the\r\ncontrary, he stood aloof from the contest, waiting for that share of\r\nthe spoil which the haughty empress of the north might think proper\r\nto allot to him, as a reward of his non-interference.\r\n\r\nBut though thus betrayed on all sides, the Poles were not disposed\r\nto submit without a struggle. They flew to arms, and found in the\r\nnephew of their king, the Prince Joseph Poniatowski, a general\r\nworthy to conduct so glorious a cause. Under his command Kosciusko\r\nfirst became known in European warfare. He distinguished himself in\r\nthe battle of Zielenec, and still more in that of Dubienska, which\r\ntook place on June 18, 1792. Upon this latter occasion he defended\r\nfor six hours, with only 4,000 men, against 15,000 Russians, a post\r\nwhich had been slightly fortified in twenty-four hours, and at last\r\nretired with inconsiderable loss.\r\n\r\nBut the contest was too unequal to last; the patriots were\r\noverwhelmed by enemies from without, and betrayed by traitors\r\nwithin, at the head of whom was their own sovereign. The Russians\r\ntook possession of the country, and proceeded to appropriate those\r\nportions of Lithuania and Volhynia which suited their convenience;\r\nwhile Prussia, the friendly Prussia, invaded another part of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the most distinguished officers in the\r\nPolish army retired from the service, and of this number was\r\nKosciusko. Miserable at the fate of his unhappy country, and at the\r\nsame time an object of suspicion to the ruling powers, he left his\r\nnative land and retired to Leipsic, where he received intelligence\r\nof the honor which had been conferred upon him by the Legislative\r\nAssembly of France, who had invested him with the quality of a\r\nFrench citizen.\r\n\r\nBut his fellow-countrymen were still anxious to make another\r\nstruggle for independence, and they unanimously selected Kosciusko\r\nas their chief and generalissimo. He obeyed the call, and found the\r\npatriots eager to combat under his orders. Even the noble Joseph\r\nPoniatowski, who had previously commanded in chief, returned from\r\nFrance, whither he had retired, and received from the hands of\r\nKosciusko the charge of a portion of his army.\r\n\r\nThe patriots had risen in the north of Poland, to which part\r\nKosciusko first directed his steps. Anxious to begin his campaign\r\nwith an action of vigor, he marched rapidly toward Cracow, which\r\ntown he entered triumphantly on March 24, 1794. He forthwith\r\npublished a manifesto against the Russians; and then, at the head of\r\nonly 5,000 men, he marched to meet their army. He encountered, on\r\nApril 4th, 10,000 Russians at a place called Wraclawic, and entirely\r\ndefeated them after a combat of four hours. He returned in triumph\r\nto Cracow, and shortly afterward marched along the left bank of the\r\nVistula to Polaniec, where he established his head-quarters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the inhabitants of Warsaw, animated by the recital of the\r\nheroic deeds of their countrymen, had also raised the standard of\r\nindependence, and were successful in driving the Russians from the\r\ncity, after a murderous conflict of three days. In Lithuania and\r\nSamogitia an equally successful revolution was effected before the\r\nend of April, while the Polish troops stationed in Volhynia and\r\nPodolia marched to the reinforcement of Kosciusko.\r\n\r\nThus far fortune seemed to smile upon the cause of Polish\r\nfreedom--the scene was, however, about to change. The undaunted\r\nKosciusko, having first organized a national council to conduct the\r\naffairs of government, once more advanced against the Russians. On\r\nhis march he met a new enemy in the person of the faithless\r\nFrederick William, of Prussia, who, without having even gone through\r\nthe preliminary of declaring war, had advanced into Poland at the\r\nhead of 40,000 men.\r\n\r\nKosciusko, with but 13,000 men, attacked the Prussian army on June\r\n8th, at Szcekociny. The battle was long and bloody; at length,\r\noverwhelmed by numbers, he was obliged to retreat toward Warsaw.\r\nThis he effected in so able a manner that his enemies did not dare\r\nto harass him in his march; and he effectually covered the capital\r\nand maintained his position for two months against vigorous and\r\ncontinued attacks. Immediately after this reverse the Polish\r\ngeneral, Zaionczeck, lost the battle of Chelm, and the Governor of\r\nCracow had the baseness to deliver the town to the Prussians without\r\nattempting a defence.\r\n\r\nThese disasters occasioned disturbances among the disaffected at\r\nWarsaw, which, however, were put down by the vigor and firmness of\r\nKosciusko. On July 13th the forces of the Prussians and Russians,\r\namounting to 50,000 men, assembled under the walls of Warsaw, and\r\ncommenced the siege of that city. After six weeks spent before the\r\nplace, and a succession of bloody conflicts, the confederates were\r\nobliged to raise the siege; but this respite to the Poles was but of\r\nshort duration.\r\n\r\nTheir enemies increased fearfully in number, while their own\r\nresources diminished. Austria now determined to assist in the\r\nannihilation of Poland, and caused a body of her troops to enter\r\nthat kingdom. Nearly at the same moment the Russians ravaged\r\nLithuania; and the two corps of the Russian army commanded by\r\nSuwarof and Fersen, effected their junction in spite of the battle\r\nof Krupezyce, which the Poles had ventured upon, with doubtful\r\nissue, against the first of these commanders, on September 16th.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving intelligence of these events Kosciusko left Warsaw,\r\nand placed himself at the head of the Polish army. He was attacked\r\nby the very superior forces of the confederates on October 10, 1794,\r\nat a place called Macieiowice, and for many hours supported the\r\ncombat against overwhelming odds. At length he was severely wounded,\r\nand as he fell, he uttered the prophetic words \"_Finis Poloniæ_.\" It\r\nis asserted that he had exacted from his followers an oath, not to\r\nsuffer him to fall alive into the hands of the Russians, and that in\r\nconsequence the Polish cavalry, being unable to carry him off,\r\ninflicted some severe sabre wounds on him and left him for dead on\r\nthe field; a savage fidelity, which we half admire even in\r\ncondemning it. Be this as it may, he was recognized and delivered\r\nfrom the plunderers by some Cossack chiefs; and thus was saved from\r\ndeath to meet a scarcely less harsh fate--imprisonment in a Russian\r\ndungeon.\r\n\r\nThomas Wawrzecki became the successor of Kosciusko in the command of\r\nthe army; but with the loss of their heroic leader all hope had\r\ndeserted the breasts of the Poles. They still, however, fought with\r\nall the obstinacy of despair, and defended the suburb of Warsaw,\r\ncalled Praga, with great gallantry. At length this post was wrested\r\nfrom them. Warsaw itself capitulated on November 9, 1794; and this\r\ncalamity was followed by the entire dissolution of the Polish army\r\non the 18th of the same month.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Kosciusko remained in prison at St. Petersburg;\r\nbut, at the end of two years, the death of his persecutress, the\r\nEmpress Catharine, released him. One of the first acts of the\r\nEmperor Paul was to restore him to liberty, and to load him with\r\nvarious marks of his favor. Among other gifts of the autocrat was a\r\npension, by which, however, the high-spirited patriot would never\r\nconsent to profit. No sooner was he beyond the reach of Russian\r\ninfluence than he returned to the donor the instrument by which this\r\nhumiliating favor was conferred. From this period the life of\r\nKosciusko was passed in retirement. He went first to England, and\r\nthen to the United States of America. He returned to the Old World\r\nin 1798, and took up his abode in France, where he divided his time\r\nbetween Paris and a country-house he had bought near Fontainebleau.\r\nWhile here he received the appropriate present of the sword of John\r\nSobieski, which was sent to him by some of his countrymen serving in\r\nthe French armies in Italy, who had found it in the shrine at\r\nLoretto.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, when about to invade Poland in 1807, wished to use the\r\nname of Kosciusko in order to rally the people of the country round\r\nhis standard. The patriot, aware that no real freedom was to be\r\nhoped for under such auspices, at once refused to lend himself to\r\nhis wishes. Upon this the emperor forged Kosciusko's signature to an\r\naddress to the Poles, which was distributed throughout the country.\r\nNor would he permit the injured person to deny the authenticity of\r\nthis act in any public manner. The real state of the case was,\r\nhowever, made known to many through the private representations of\r\nKosciusko; but he was never able to publish a formal denial of the\r\ntransaction till after the fall of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nWhen the Russians, in 1814, had penetrated into Champagne, and were\r\nadvancing toward Paris, they were astonished to hear that their\r\nformer adversary was living in retirement in that part of the\r\ncountry. The circumstances of this discovery were striking. The\r\ncommune in which Kosciusko lived was subjected to plunder, and among\r\nthe troops thus engaged he observed a Polish regiment. Transported\r\nwith anger, he rushed among them, and thus addressed the officers:\r\n\"When I commanded brave soldiers they never pillaged; and I should\r\nhave punished severely subalterns who allowed of disorders such as\r\nthose which we see around. Still more severely should I have\r\npunished older officers, who authorized such conduct by their\r\nculpable neglect.\" \"And who are you,\" was the general cry, \"that you\r\ndare to speak with such boldness to us?\" \"I am Kosciusko.\" The\r\neffect was electric: the soldiery cast down their arms, prostrated\r\nthemselves at his feet, and cast dust upon their heads according to\r\na national usage, supplicating his forgiveness for the fault which\r\nthey had committed. For twenty years the name of Kosciusko had not\r\nbeen heard in Poland save as that of an exile; yet it still retained\r\nits ancient power over Polish hearts; a power never used but for\r\nsome good and generous end.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Alexander honored him with a long interview, and offered\r\nhim an asylum in his own country. But nothing could induce Kosciusko\r\nagain to see his unfortunate native land. In 1815 he retired to\r\nSoleure, in Switzerland; where he died, October 16, 1817, in\r\nconsequence of an injury received by a fall from his horse. Not long\r\nbefore he had abolished slavery upon his Polish estate, and declared\r\nall his serfs entirely free, by a deed registered and executed with\r\nevery formality that could insure the full performance of his\r\nintention. The mortal remains of Kosciusko were removed to Poland at\r\nthe expense of Alexander, and have found a fitting place of rest in\r\nthe cathedral of Cracow, between those of his companions in arms,\r\nJoseph Poniatowski, and the greatest of Polish warriors, John\r\nSobieski.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE[4]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 4: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM F. PECK\r\n\r\n(1757-1834)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquis de la Fayette.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMarie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de la Fayette,[5]\r\none of the most celebrated men that France ever produced, was born\r\nat Chavaignac, in Auvergne, on September 6, 1757, of a noble family,\r\nwith a long line of illustrious ancestors. Left an orphan at the age\r\nof thirteen, he married, three years later, his cousin Anastasie,\r\nCountess de Noailles. Inspired from the earliest age with a love of\r\nfreedom and aversion to constraint, the impulses of childhood became\r\nthe daydreams of youth and the realities of maturer life. Filled\r\nwith enthusiastic sympathy for the struggling colonies of America in\r\ntheir contest with Great Britain, he offered his services to the\r\nUnited States, and, though his enterprise was forbidden by the\r\nFrench Government, hired a vessel, sailed for this country, landed\r\nat Charleston in April, 1777, and proceeded to Philadelphia. His\r\nadvances having been treated by Congress with some coldness, by\r\nreason of the incessant application of other foreigners for\r\ncommissions, he offered to serve as a volunteer and at his own\r\nexpense. Congress may be excused for having taken him at his word;\r\non July 31st it appointed him major-general, without pay the titular\r\nhonor, which carried with it no command, being, perhaps, the highest\r\never given in America to a young man of nineteen years. Having\r\naccepted the cordial invitation of General Washington, the\r\ncommander-in-chief, to live at his head-quarters and to serve on his\r\nstaff, Lafayette was severely wounded in the leg at the battle of\r\nthe Brandywine, on September 11th, and the intrepidity he displayed\r\nin that engagement was equalled by the fortitude that he evinced\r\nduring the following winter, in which he shared the privations of\r\nthe American army in the wretched camp at Valley Forge. His fidelity\r\nto Washington at this time, when the latter was maligned by secret\r\nfoes and conspired against by Conway's cabal, cemented the\r\nfriendship between those great men. Lafayette was soon afterward\r\ndetached to take command of an expedition that was to set out from\r\nAlbany, cross Lake Champlain on the ice, and invade Canada; but, on\r\narriving at the intended starting-point, and finding that no\r\nadequate preparations had been made, he refused to repeat the\r\nunfortunate experiment of Montgomery and Arnold of two years before,\r\nand waited for suitable supplies to be sent to him before setting\r\nout. These came not, the ice melted in March, and he returned to\r\nValley Forge, with the thanks of Congress for his forbearance in\r\nabstaining from risking the loss of an army in order to acquire\r\npersonal glory. France having declared war against England, May 2,\r\n1778, and at the same time effected an alliance with the colonies,\r\nLafayette returned home in January, 1779; on his arrival at Paris he\r\nwas lionized and fêted, and during his stay there he received from\r\nthe United States Congress a sword with massive gold handle and\r\nmounting, presented to him in appreciation of his services and\r\nparticularly of his gallantry at the battle of Monmouth, on June\r\n28th, in the preceding year. The high reputation that he had\r\nacquired in America increased his influence at home to such a degree\r\nthat he was able to accomplish the object of his mission and procure\r\nmoney and troops from the ministry of war. These followed him to\r\nthis country in the following year, but little was accomplished\r\nthereby, D'Estaing, the commander of the fleet, being blockaded in\r\nthe harbor of Newport, and Washington being unwilling to undertake\r\nthe contemplated attack on New York, even with the assistance of the\r\nFrench military force, without naval co-operation. In February,\r\n1781, Lafayette was sent with a division into Virginia, where he\r\nsoon found himself arrayed against the British general, Lord\r\nCornwallis. That distinguished officer, the best, perhaps, of all on\r\nthat side of the conflict, expected to make short work of his\r\nyouthful antagonist, but Lafayette, who had learned from Washington\r\nthe art of skilful retreat combined with cautious advance,\r\nsucceeded, after a long series of skirmishes, in shutting Cornwallis\r\nup in Yorktown. In September, the French fleet, under the Count de\r\nGrasse, appeared and landed a force of 3,000 men under the Marquis\r\nde St. Simon. Lafayette was urged to make the assault at once and\r\ngain the glory of an important capture, but a feeling of honor,\r\ncombined possibly with prudential considerations, impelled him to\r\nwait for the arrival of the main allied army under Washington and\r\nRochambeau. They came a fortnight later, the investment was\r\nregularly made, and on October 14th Lafayette successfully led the\r\nAmericans to the assault of one of the redoubts, while another was\r\ntaken by the French under the Baron de Viomesnil. The surrender of\r\nCornwallis, with his army of 7,000, took place on the 19th, which\r\nended, practically, the American war of independence, though the\r\nfinal treaty of peace was not signed till January 20, 1783, the\r\nfirst knowledge of which came to Congress by a letter from\r\nLafayette, who had returned to Europe in the meantime. Revisiting\r\nthe United States in 1784, he was treated with great consideration\r\nby his old comrades in arms, and the next year he travelled through\r\nRussia, Austria, and Prussia, in the last of which he attended the\r\nmilitary reviews of Frederick the Great in company with that\r\nrenowned soldier.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 5: The condensed form of the name, when used apart\r\n         from the title, is preferable to the open, for, though he\r\n         employed the conventional style, De La Fayette, up to the\r\n         time of the French Revolution, he then abandoned it, and\r\n         always afterward wrote it as one word, Lafayette, which is\r\n         now the family name.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time Lafayette's history is bound up with that of his\r\ncountry. Beginning by formulating plans for meliorating the\r\ncondition of the slaves on his plantation in French Guiana, his\r\nphilanthropic thoughts soon turned homeward. He saw France groaning\r\nunder oppression and the people suffering from a thousand antiquated\r\nabuses. Some of these he succeeded in mitigating, in his capacity of\r\nmember of the Assembly of the Notables, in 1787, but, as nothing of\r\npermanent value was accomplished by that body, he urged the\r\nconvocation of the States General. In this assemblage, which met at\r\nVersailles, on May 4, 1789, he sat at first among the nobility, but\r\nwhen the deputies of the people declared themselves to be the\r\nNational Assembly--afterward called the Constituent Assembly--he was\r\none of the earliest of his order to join them and was elected one of\r\nthe vice-presidents. On July 14th the Bastille was taken by the mob,\r\nand on the following day Lafayette was chosen commandant of the\r\nNational Guard of Paris; an irregular body, partly military, partly\r\npolice, having no connection with the royal army and in full\r\nsympathy with the people, from which its ranks were filled. On the\r\n17th King Louis XVI. came into the city, where he was received by\r\nthe populace with the liveliest expressions of attachment and\r\nescorted to the Hôtel de Ville, where Lafayette and Mayor Bailly\r\nawaited him at the foot of the staircase, up which he passed under\r\nan arch of steel formed by the uplifted swords of the members of the\r\nMunicipal Council. Bailly offered to the king a tricolor cockade,\r\nwhich had been recently adopted as the national emblem, Lafayette,\r\nin devising it, having added white, the Bourbon color, to the red\r\nand blue that were the colors of Paris, to show the fidelity of the\r\npeople to the institution of royalty. The king accepted the badge,\r\npinned it to his breast, appeared with it on the balcony before the\r\nvast throng, and returned to Versailles with the feeling, on his\r\npart and that of others, that the reconciliation between all parties\r\nwas complete and that the era of popular government had begun.\r\nInstead of that, the troubles continually increased, and Lafayette\r\nwas placed in a most trying position, equally opposed to the\r\nencroachments of the destructionists and to the intrigues of the\r\ncourt, and longing as eagerly for the retention of the monarchy as\r\nfor the establishment of the constitution. The brutal murder of\r\nFoulon, the superintendent of the revenue, and of his son-in-law\r\nBerthier, who were torn in pieces by the enraged populace on the\r\n22d, in spite of the commands, entreaties, and even tears of\r\nLafayette, so disgusted him that he resigned his command, and\r\nresumed it only when the sixty districts of Paris agreed to support\r\nhim in his efforts to maintain order. On October 5th a mob of\r\nseveral thousand women set out from Paris to march to Versailles,\r\nwith vague ideas of extorting from the National Assembly the passage\r\nof laws that should remove all distresses, of obtaining in some way\r\na supply of food that should relieve the immediate needs of the\r\ncapital, and of bringing back with them the royal family. The\r\nNational Guard were urgent to accompany the women, partly from a\r\ndesire to protect them in case of a possible collision with the\r\nroyal troops, but still more to bring on a conflict with a regiment\r\nlately brought from the frontier, and to exterminate the body-guard\r\nof the king, the members of which had, at a supper given a few\r\nnights before, been so indiscreet as to trample the tricolor under\r\ntheir feet and pin the white cockade to their lapels. Lafayette did\r\nall in his power to prevent the march of the National Guard, sitting\r\non his horse for eight hours in their midst, and refusing all their\r\nentreaties to give the word of command, till the Municipal Council\r\nfinally issued the order and the troops set forth. Arrived at\r\nVersailles he posted one of his regiments in different parts of the\r\npalace, to protect it in case it were really attacked by rioters,\r\nand then, in the early morning, repairing to his head-quarters in an\r\nadjoining street, he threw himself on a bed, for a short season of\r\nnecessary repose. Monarchical writers generally have reproached him\r\nfor this act, calling it his \"fatal sleep,\" the source of unnumbered\r\nwoes, the beginning of the downfall; but it is difficult to see\r\nwherein he can justly be blamed for yielding, wearied out with\r\nfatigue, to the imperative demand of nature, after providing as far\r\nas possible for the preservation of order. Awakened in a few minutes\r\nby the report that the worst had happened, he hurried to the scene\r\nand found that the mob, having broken down the iron railings of the\r\ncourtyard, had invaded the palace and massacred two of the\r\nbody-guard, and that the lives of the king and queen were in instant\r\nperil. With characteristic courage, activity, and address he\r\nprevented the further effusion of blood, and the entire royal\r\nfamily, together with the Assembly, migrated to Paris the same day,\r\nescorted by the citizen soldiers and a turbulent mob both male and\r\nfemale. July 14, 1790, was memorable for the Oath of Federation,\r\ntaken in the Champ de Mars, with imposing ceremonies, upon a\r\nplatform of earth raised by the voluntary labors of all the\r\ncitizens. Lafayette, as representative of the nation, and\r\nparticularly of the militia, was the first to take the oath to be\r\nfaithful to the law and the king and to support the constitution\r\nthen under consideration by the Assembly. With a shout of\r\naffirmation from all of the National Guard, the taking of the entire\r\noath by the president of the Assembly and the king, followed by a\r\nroar of assent from nearly half a million of spectators, and the\r\njoyful spreading of the news throughout the country by prearranged\r\nsignals, the dream of peace and harmony came back again, as bright\r\nand as fleeting as the year before. Three days later the National\r\nGuard of France, outside of the city, united in an address to\r\nLafayette, expressive of their confidence in his ability and his\r\npatriotism, and regretting their inability to serve under him, for,\r\nby the terms of a law proposed by himself, the commander of the\r\nmilitia of Paris was to have no authority over other troops. In\r\nSeptember the municipality made a strong appeal to him to revoke his\r\ndeclaration that he would accept no pay or salary or indemnity of\r\nany kind, but he refused fixedly, saying that his fortune was\r\nconsiderable, that it had sufficed for two revolutions and that it\r\nwould be devoted to a third, if one should arise, for the benefit of\r\nthe people. By the death of Mirabeau, April 2, 1791, the last chance\r\nof a compromise between the court party and the radicals was taken\r\naway. Two weeks later the royal family attempted to leave the\r\nTuileries for St. Cloud, in order to pass the Easter holidays there\r\nand to hear mass in the royal chapel; but the populace blocked the\r\nway, and even a portion of the National Guard, in a state of\r\nsemi-mutiny, threatened to interfere if the other battalions fired\r\non the people. This, nevertheless, Lafayette offered to do, and to\r\nforce a passage at all hazards, but the king positively forbade the\r\nshedding of blood on his account, and resumed his virtual\r\nimprisonment in the palace. Lafayette was so chagrined by the\r\nseditious behavior of his troops that he again threw down his\r\ncommission, whereupon an extraordinary revulsion of feeling took\r\nplace; the municipality and the citizens were terror-stricken lest\r\nuniversal anarchy should ensue, and even the National Guard,\r\nrepentant of their disgraceful conduct, cast themselves at the feet\r\nof their general, joining their voices to those of others in\r\nentreating him to resume his office, which, after three days, he\r\nconsented to do, upon promise of obedience in the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Arch of Steel.]\r\n\r\nThis was the meridian of Lafayette's career, when his popularity and\r\nhis influence were at their height. Power we can hardly call it, for\r\nthat implies some voluntary deed of assumption, and he always acted\r\nin obedience to others, to some authority constituted at least under\r\nthe forms of law, or, in the absence of that, to the sovereign\r\npeople. From this time difficulties thickened around him and he was\r\nconstantly environed by suspicion and by intrigues of all kinds\r\nagainst his character and his life, but he never swerved from the\r\nline of his duty. Not one of the political parties gave him its\r\nentire confidence, and each in turn conspired against him, only to\r\nbe baffled by the underlying conviction, on the part of the masses,\r\nof his supreme patriotism and integrity. After the flight of the\r\nking and his family, on June 20th, Lafayette was violently denounced\r\nin the Jacobin club as a friend to royalty, and accused of having\r\nassisted in the evasion; but the attempt to proscribe him in the\r\nAssembly failed utterly, and that body appointed six commissioners\r\nto protect him from the sudden fury of the people. The royal\r\nfugitives having been stopped at Varennes and brought back to the\r\nTuileries on the 25th, he saved them, by his personal efforts, from\r\nbeing torn in pieces by the mob, but was compelled to guard them\r\nmuch more strictly than before. On July 17th a disorderly assemblage\r\ngathered in the Champ de Mars to petition for the overthrow of the\r\nmonarchy, and, in the tumult that ensued on the appearance of the\r\ntroops, Lafayette ordered a volley of musketry, whereby the rioters\r\nwere dispersed with a loss of several killed and wounded, but\r\nwhereby, also, while that act of firmness elicited commendation from\r\nall lovers of order, occasion was given for further intrigues on the\r\npart of his enemies and the shattering of his influence among the\r\nlower classes. A momentary gleam of sunshine broke forth in\r\nSeptember, when, the king having accepted the new constitution,\r\nLafayette took advantage of the general state of good feeling\r\nthereby produced to propose a comprehensive act of amnesty for all\r\noffences committed on either side during the revolution, which was\r\npassed by the Constituent Assembly just before its final adjournment\r\non the 30th. On that day he resigned, permanently, the command of\r\nthe National Guard, and retired to his estate at Chavaignac, being\r\nfollowed by the most gratifying testimonials of public regard, among\r\nthem a sword and a marble statue of Washington, presented by the\r\ncity of Paris, and a sword cast from one of the bolts of the\r\nBastille, given by his old soldiers. Contrary to his personal\r\nwishes, his friends and his patriotism persuaded him, in November,\r\nto stand as a candidate for the mayoralty of Paris, with the result\r\nthat might have been foreseen, for Pétion, being supported both by\r\nthe Jacobins and by the court party, was elected by a large\r\nmajority. This defeat did not prevent Lafayette's appointment, a\r\nmonth later, to the command of one of the three armies formed to\r\ndefend the frontier against an expected invasion of the Austrians,\r\nthe rank of lieutenant-general being given to him, with the exalted\r\nhonor of marshal of France. War was declared against Austria, April\r\n20, 1792, and hostilities began, but even the active service in\r\nwhich he was engaged could not keep his thoughts from the political\r\ncondition of the country, and on June 16th he wrote to the\r\nLegislative Assembly, which had succeeded the Constituent in the\r\nprevious autumn, a letter in which he pointed out the dangers that\r\nmenaced the nation and denounced the Jacobins as the faction whose\r\ngrowing power was full of peril to the state. Four days later the\r\nmob invaded the Tuileries and passed riotously through all the\r\nrooms, insulting in the grossest manner the royal family, who were\r\ncompelled to stand before them and undergo this humiliation for\r\nthree hours. On hearing of this event Lafayette hurried from his\r\ncamp and appeared before the Assembly, entreating the punishment of\r\nthe instigators of the outrage. His sublime audacity in thus\r\nopposing his own personality to the machinations of his enemies, and\r\nthat, too, before a body already irritated by his unasked advice,\r\nparalyzed the fury of his adversaries, while his eloquence charmed\r\nthe hearts of his hearers; but all was in vain, and the only result\r\nof this heroic action was that a decree of accusation was brought in\r\nagainst him, which was rejected by a vote of 406 to 224. Upon the\r\nmassacre of the Swiss Guards, on August 10th, followed by the actual\r\ndeposition and imprisonment of the king, Lafayette sounded his army\r\nto ascertain if they would march to Paris in defence of\r\nconstitutional government, but he found them vacillating and\r\nuntrustworthy. His own dismissal from command came soon after:\r\norders were sent for his arrest, and nothing remained for him but\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nOn August 19th he left the army and attempted to pass through\r\nBelgium on his way to England, but he was captured by Austrian\r\nsoldiers near the frontier. He protested that he no longer held rank\r\nas an officer in the army and should be considered as a private\r\ncitizen; but his rights were not respected in either capacity, for\r\nhe was not treated as a prisoner of war neither was he arraigned as\r\na criminal. On the contrary, without any charges being preferred\r\nagainst him, and without the formality of a trial of any kind, he\r\nwas immediately thrown into prison and was detained in various\r\nBelgian, Prussian, and Austrian jails and fortresses for more than\r\nfive years, the last three being passed in close confinement at\r\nOlmutz. An unsuccessful attempt at escape increased the severity of\r\nhis detention, and he nearly lost his life through the hardships and\r\nprivations that he endured, till his wife and daughters came, in\r\n1795, and voluntarily shared his incarceration. The only reason for\r\nthe savage treatment that he received, unjustified by any forms of\r\ninternational, of military, or of criminal law, seems to have lain\r\nin the fact that he had been a member of the National Assembly and\r\nprominent in the constitutional struggle for liberty. A feeling of\r\nrevenge, as mean as it was groundless--for he had done everything in\r\nhis power to protect the dignity as well as the life of Marie\r\nAntoinette, the sister of the Austrian emperor--joined with a fear\r\nthat other peoples might follow the lead of the French and overthrow\r\nmonarchical institutions unless deterred by some world-shocking\r\nexample, formed the mainspring of this atrocious procedure. Efforts\r\nwere made in this country and in England to procure the release of\r\nthe prisoner, but no governmental action was taken in that\r\ndirection, the United States Congress declining to pass a resolution\r\nto that effect, so that President Washington was left alone in his\r\nunceasing attempts, by instructions to our ministers abroad and by a\r\npersonal letter to the emperor, to repay some of the debt that he\r\nand the whole country owed to our adopted citizen. It was not till\r\nthe successes of the French republican armies enabled General\r\nBonaparte, at the instance of the Directory, to insist upon the\r\nliberation of Lafayette as one of the conditions of the treaty of\r\nCampo Formio, that he was discharged on September 19, 1797, the\r\nAustrian Government pretending that this was done out of regard for\r\nthe United States of America. Passing into Denmark and Holland he\r\nresided in those countries for two years, when he returned to France\r\nonly to receive from Bonaparte a significant message recommending to\r\nhim a very quiet life, a piece of advice which, as it accorded with\r\nhis own desires, he followed, settling down at Lagrange, an estate\r\ninherited by his wife, as his own property had been confiscated by\r\nthe National Convention, which had succeeded the Legislative\r\nAssembly. True to the principles that he had always entertained, he\r\ncast his vote, in 1802, with less than nine thousand others, and in\r\nopposition to the suffrages of more than three-and-a-half millions,\r\nagainst the decree to make Bonaparte consul for life, writing after\r\nhis name on the polling register the statement that he could not\r\nvote for such a measure till public freedom was sufficiently\r\nguaranteed. This insured the continued displeasure of the military\r\ndespot, who revenged himself by refusing to Lafayette's only son,\r\nGeorge Washington, the promotion that he had earned by his brilliant\r\nexploits in the army. President Jefferson's offer in 1803, of the\r\ngovernorship of the province of Louisiana, just after its purchase\r\nfrom France, was rejected by Lafayette, who continued in his\r\nretirement through the time of the empire and after the first\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons, till the return from Elba, in March,\r\n1815, of Napoleon, who used every exertion to conciliate him and win\r\nhis support. All these overtures he declined, but, on the other\r\nhand, accepted an election to the popular branch of the Legislature,\r\nof which he was chosen vice-president. After the battle of Waterloo,\r\non June 18th, Napoleon returned to Paris and proposed to his council\r\nthe dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and the assumption of\r\nabsolutely dictatorial power; a desperate project which was\r\nfrustrated only by the alertness, vigor, and energy of Lafayette,\r\nwhose eloquent appeals induced the Legislature to compel the final\r\nabdication of the emperor, under the alternative threat of\r\nforfeiture and expulsion. Five commissioners, with Lafayette at the\r\nhead, appointed by the chambers, proceeded to the head-quarters of\r\nthe allied sovereigns, at Haguenau, to treat for peace; but, while\r\nnegotiations were pending, the foreign armies pushed on toward the\r\ncapital, and he returned on July 3d, to find that Paris had\r\ncapitulated and was at the mercy of the conquerors, who dictated\r\ntheir own terms, forcibly dissolved the Corps Législatif, and\r\nreplaced Louis XVIII. on the throne. Lafayette retired to Lagrange,\r\nbut was again elected, in 1817, a deputy, in spite of the strenuous\r\nopposition of the Government, and exerted his influence in favor of\r\nliberal measures, though with indifferent success. In 1824, on the\r\ninvitation of President Monroe, he revisited this country, travelled\r\nthrough every State, was received with the highest honors by\r\nCongress (which voted him $200,000 and a township of land for his\r\nservices), by legislatures, by colleges, by corporations of cities,\r\nby societies of all kinds by his surviving comrades of the\r\nrevolution, and by the whole nation; took part in the laying of the\r\ncorner-stone of the Bunker Hill Monument June 17, 1825, and sailed\r\nfor home in September, on the United States frigate Brandywine,\r\nwhich had been put at his disposal by the Government. Soon after his\r\nreturn to France he was re-elected to the Corps Législatif, and\r\nserved as a member for most of the remainder of his life. The stupid\r\ntyranny of King Charles X. having caused an outbreak of the\r\nParisians in July, 1830, Lafayette unhesitatingly espoused the\r\npopular cause, and, though nearly seventy-three years old, accepted\r\nthe command of the National Guard; after a conflict of three days\r\nthe royal troops gave way, the king abdicated, to be succeeded by\r\nthe Duke of Orleans as King Louis Philippe, and Lafayette had the\r\nsatisfaction of contributing largely to the establishment of what he\r\nhad advocated so strongly forty years before--a constitutional\r\nmonarchy. He died at his home, in the country, on May 20, 1834, but\r\nhis remains were taken to Paris for interment, and as the funeral\r\ntrain passed through the streets the lamentations on every hand\r\nattested the affection and the sorrow of the people. Few men have\r\nlived who present a figure so attractive to the eye of the student;\r\nfewer still, so prominent on the theatre of history, who will bear,\r\nwith so little possibility of censure, the closest scrutiny, the\r\nseverest judgment. His actions were visible to all the world, his\r\nmotives were transparent, his sentiments were unconcealed, his life\r\nwas blameless. To the physical endowments of dignity of person and\r\nresistless charm of manner he added all desirable qualities of head\r\nand heart, a dauntless courage, an enthusiasm beautiful and yet\r\nconsistent, a sublime patriotism, a disinterested generosity. If,\r\nwith all these, he seems to have failed of achieving the highest\r\nsuccess, it was because not of what he lacked but of what he\r\npossessed in the fullest degree, a lofty integrity that forbade him\r\nto pander to the passions of the mob, a supreme regard for the\r\nrights of the community and of the individual. He might have\r\nsnatched the sovereign power, but in doing it he would have lost his\r\nself-respect. In place, then, of glittering success, he obtained the\r\nquiet admiration of mankind and the loving gratitude of two nations.\r\n\r\n[Signature: William F.

His son, the Grand-Dauphin, died four years before\r\nhis father, and his grandson, the Duke of Burgundy, a year later.\r\nLouis the Great was therefore succeeded by his great-grandson, Louis\r\nXV. During this reign the nation continued on the decline. He was\r\nfollowed by his grandson, Louis XVI., a better man than his immediate\r\npredecessor, but too weak to carry out the reforms necessary to\r\nrestore the prosperity of the nation. Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu,\r\nand many other writers, as well as the influence of the American\r\nRevolution, had fostered democratic ideas among the people, for the\r\ngovernment was reeking with abuses.\r\n\r\nThe parliament had not assembled for three-quarters of a century;\r\nbut representatives of the people met in 1789, in spite of the\r\nopposition of the king. The extreme of license followed the extreme\r\nof absolutism. The king opposed the Constituent Assembly, for this\r\nbody changed its name several times, till the political conflict\r\nended in the death by the guillotine of Louis XVI., and later by the\r\nexecution of his queen, Marie Antoinette. For every two hundred and\r\nfifty of the gross population there was a member of the nobility who\r\nwas exempted from the payment of any land tax, though this kind of\r\nproperty was almost exclusively in their possession, and from many\r\nother taxes and burdens, which all the more heavily weighed down\r\nthe great body of the people. The latter had a long list of genuine\r\ngrievances which the king and his advisers refused to remedy.\r\n\r\nThe revolution became an accomplished fact in the capture and\r\ndestruction of the Bastille, on July 14, 1789, which day is still\r\ncelebrated as a national holiday in France. It had been for hundreds\r\nof years a prison for political offenders, and was regarded by the\r\npeople as the principal emblem and instrument of tyranny. The\r\npopulation became as intemperate as their rulers had been, thousands\r\nperished by the guillotine, and the reign of terror was established.\r\nThe National Convention proclaimed a republic; but this body was\r\ndivided by conflicting opinions, and had not the power to inaugurate\r\ntheir ideal government. Blood flowed in rivers, and the reaction was\r\ninfinitely more terrible than the tyranny which had produced it.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was divided into at least four parties, though the\r\nlines which separated them were not very clearly defined. The\r\nJacobins were the most prominent, and the most radical. It had its\r\norigin in the Jacobin Club, formed in Versailles, taking its name\r\nfrom a convent in which it met. This organization soon spread\r\nthrough its branches all over France, and its party was the most\r\nviolent and blood-thirsty in the convention. Danton, Robespierre,\r\nMarat, Desmoulins, and other desperate leaders were of this faction.\r\n\r\nThe Girondists were next in numbers and influence. They were the\r\nmoderate republicans of the time, though at first they were inclined\r\nto accept the constitution, and favor a limited monarchy. Its name\r\ncame from the earliest leaders of the party who were representatives\r\nfrom the department of the Gironde. Its members labored to check the\r\nviolence and bloodshed of the times, and might be called the\r\nrespectable party of the period. Unfortunately they were in the\r\nminority, and all the members of the party in the Convention who did\r\nnot escape, were arrested, convicted, and guillotined.\r\n\r\nThe Montagnards (mountaineers) or Montagne (Mountain) was the term\r\napplied to the Democrats holding the most extreme views, though its\r\nmembers were also Jacobins and Cordeliers. Among them were the most\r\nblood-thirsty, unreasonable, and intolerant men of the time, for\r\nDanton, Robespierre, Marat, St. Just, and others of that stamp,\r\naffiliated with them. They took their name from the fact that they\r\nwere grouped together in the uppermost seats of the chamber of the\r\nConvention. The Cordeliers was hardly more than another name for a\r\nclub of the same men, so called from the chapel of a Franciscan\r\nmonastery where they held their meetings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charlotte Corday and Marat.]\r\n\r\nJean Paul Marat was one of the most prominent personages of the\r\nRevolution, whose infamy will continue to be perpetuated down to\r\ngenerations yet to come, with other of his red-handed associates. He\r\nwas a Frenchman, though he spent considerable time in Holland and\r\nGreat Britain, where he practised medicine, having studied the\r\nprofession at Bordeaux. He made some reputation as a political\r\nwriter, and in Edinburgh obtained a degree. It is believed that he\r\nwas convicted for stealing, and sentenced to five years imprisonment\r\nat Oxford under several _aliases_. Perhaps he was sincere in his\r\nopinions, and he threw himself vigorously into the work of the\r\nRevolution in Paris, issuing inflammatory pamphlets, which he caused\r\nto be printed and circulated secretly. He established an infamous\r\njournal, attacking the king and all his supporters, and especially\r\nthe Girondists, whose moderation disgusted him. His virulence caused\r\nhim to be intensely hated, and twice he was compelled to flee to\r\nLondon, and once to hide in the sewers. In the latter he contracted\r\na loathsome disease of the skin which soon began to eat away his\r\nlife; and his sufferings from it intensified his zeal and his\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nMarat was elected to the Convention as a delegate from Paris.\r\nPerhaps he was to a greater degree responsible for the September\r\nmassacre than any other man. While he was dying of his malady he was\r\nurging on his fanatical measures, and declared that most of the\r\nmembers of the Convention, Mirabeau first, ought to be executed. His\r\nmost virulent hatred was directed against the Girondists, whose\r\nexecution he advocated with all the venom of his nature. Though he\r\ncould write only when seated in a bath, he continued to hurl his\r\ninvectives against them, impatient for the guillotine to do its gory\r\nwork upon them.\r\n\r\nThe avenger was at hand. Charlotte Corday d'Armont was the\r\ngranddaughter of Corneille, the great tragic poet of France. Though\r\nof noble descent, she was born in a cottage, for her father was a\r\ncountry gentleman so poor that he could not support his family. His\r\ndaughters worked in the fields like the peasants, till he was\r\ncompelled to abandon them. Then they obtained admission to a convent\r\nin Caen, where they were received on account of their birth and\r\ntheir poverty. The library furnished Charlotte abundant reading\r\nmatter, and she read works on philosophy, though she also rather\r\ninflated her imagination by the perusal of romances, which had some\r\ninfluence on her after life.\r\n\r\nWhen monasteries and convents were abolished, she was turned loose\r\nupon the world; but her aunt, as poor almost as her father, took the\r\nyoung woman, now nineteen years old, to her home in Caen. Charlotte\r\nhad developed into a beautiful girl, rather tall, honest, and\r\ninnocent. She had imbibed republican sentiments from her father in\r\nspite of his nobility, and Caen was the head-quarters of the\r\nGirondists. She was familiar with the details of the struggle\r\nbetween the Jacobins and the Girondists, and they inspired her with\r\nan intense feeling against the persecutors of her people, as she\r\nregarded the latter. The members of that party who had been driven\r\nfrom Paris instructed her. She was a woman; but if she had been a\r\nqueen she had the nerve to rule a nation and fight its battles.\r\n\r\nA tremendous purpose took possession of her being. It was not\r\nprompted by the spirit of revenge. She was mistaken, but she\r\nbelieved that the removal of Marat was the remedy for the evils of\r\nthe time; and this became the work of her life, upon which she\r\nentered, fully conscious that her path ended at an ignominious\r\ngrave. She had an admirer in a young man by the name of Franquelin,\r\nand though she favored him she sacrificed her attachment to what she\r\nregarded as a lofty, even a sublime duty. She had the means to\r\nproceed to Paris and she went by the coach. She deceived her aunt,\r\nher father, and her sisters with the statement that she was going to\r\nEngland in search of remunerative employment. She went to a hotel in\r\nthe great city which had been recommended to her in Caen.\r\n\r\nA friend had given her a letter of recommendation to Duperret, a\r\nGirondist deputy, by the aid of which she hoped to get into the\r\npresence of Marat. She had arranged a plan for the assassination of\r\nthe brawling fanatic, and it was to take place at the celebration of\r\nthe anniversary of the destruction of the Bastille, July 14th, on\r\nthe Champ de Mars. She desired to do the deed as publicly as\r\npossible, not to make it sensational, but in order to produce the\r\nstronger impression upon the minds of the people. The postponement\r\nof the celebration, for the suppression of the rebellion among the\r\nVendeans, prevented the execution of her first plan, and she then\r\ndecided to strike down her victim in his seat at the \"summit of the\r\nmountain,\" in the midst of the victim's accomplices. Then she\r\nlearned that Marat was confined to his lodgings by his malady. She\r\npromptly determined to confront him in his own home.\r\n\r\nShe wrote a note to him, professing to be a sufferer at the hands of\r\nthe Girondists, asking for an appointment at his house. He made it,\r\nbut was unable to keep it. She wrote another note, and then went to\r\nthe house in the Rue de l'École de Médecine, now a part of the\r\nBoulevard St. Germain. The woman with whom Marat lived refused to\r\nadmit her, and she crowded up a short stairway. Her intended victim\r\nheard the altercation, and suspecting it was the person who had sent\r\nhim two notes, he called out to Catherine Everard to admit her.\r\nCharlotte had visited the Palais Royal and purchased a knife, which\r\nwas concealed in her bosom in readiness to do the deed.\r\n\r\nMarat, though at the height of his pernicious influence, lived in\r\nmean and squalid apartments, in a sort of pride of poverty as \"the\r\nfriend of the people.\" In spite of his disease, which compelled him\r\nto work in a bath, he was always busy. The room was littered with\r\npapers and pamphlets. He was only five feet in height, with a\r\nnaturally disagreeable face, increased by his malady. At the very\r\ntime his visitor entered his den, he was making out on a board\r\nbefore him a list of Girondists to be executed. She would not look\r\nat him, but she told him a story she had invented, and gave him the\r\nnames of Girondist refugees at Caen; to which he replied as he wrote\r\nthem down, that \"they should have the guillotine before they were a\r\nweek older.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, as though they had steeled her arm, she drew the\r\nknife from her bosom, and with superhuman power, plunged it to the\r\nhilt and to the heart of Marat. He called for help and then expired.\r\nAssistance came, and the house was thronged with National Guards and\r\npolicemen. They were necessary to save the murderess from the fury\r\nof those who forced their way into the house. She was arrested, and\r\nconveyed in the same carriage in which she had come to the\r\nConciergerie. All Paris groaned and howled.\r\n\r\nShe had the form of a trial, and the guillotine quickly followed it.\r\nHer fortitude did not forsake her at any time, and she died as\r\nfirmly as any martyr ever went to the stake. Her beauty and her\r\nheroism excited the sympathy of the crowd, but they could not save\r\nher. She was a mistaken heroine, but her courage and fortitude were\r\nsublime.\r\n\r\n[Signature: William S. Adams.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME ROLAND[7]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 7: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy ELLA WHEELER WILCOX\r\n\r\n(1754-1793)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Madame Roland.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance has produced many remarkable women; perhaps no other country\r\ncan boast such an array of illustrious names; they shine from the\r\npages of French history like fixed stars from the firmament. Among\r\nthem, down the long vista of a hundred years, brilliant and\r\nbeautiful, shines the name of Madame Roland, the spirit of the great\r\nFrench Revolution personified.\r\n\r\nStriking beauty, great genius, and wonderful courage in the hour of\r\nmartyrdom, rendered this woman an unusual character in an unusual\r\nepoch. Surrounded by deceit, she was honest and fearless. In the\r\nmidst of immorality and license, she was pure, and brave enough to\r\nresist temptation which came from without and from within, and she\r\nwent to the scaffold with an untarnished name and soul.\r\n\r\nManon Philipon, as Madame Roland was known in her childhood, was\r\nborn in Paris in the year 1754. Her father was a worker in enamel,\r\nwho thrived well enough in his art when he was content to toil at\r\nit, but a restless spirit of speculation led him into ventures which\r\nbrought him neither profit nor renown.\r\n\r\nManon's beauty was a direct inheritance from both father and mother.\r\nGratien Philipon was a handsome man, and vain and frivolous as he\r\nwas handsome; but his beautiful wife was serious-minded, and much\r\nthe superior of her husband in intellect as well as morals. Of seven\r\nchildren born to this couple, only one lived--Manon, the subject of\r\nour sketch--who inherited the combined beauty of both parents, with\r\nthe rectitude and high ideals of the mother. But there lies no\r\nexplanation of inheritance from either father or mother to make us\r\nunderstand how the child of these common people became at nine years\r\nof age a student of Plutarch, Tasso, and Voltaire, and a philosopher\r\nat the age of eleven. It requires a deeper law than that of heredity\r\nto explain these things.\r\n\r\nAt ten, Manon developed a strongly religious tendency, which was\r\nfostered, no doubt, by daily studying the \"Lives of the Saints.\"\r\nWhile reading the accounts of martyrs who had died at the stake\r\nrather than resign their faith, the child often regretted that she\r\nhad not lived in those \"good old days,\" so happy a thing it seemed\r\nto her to die for one's principles. This privilege was granted her\r\nin after-years, strangely enough; and she proved as courageous in\r\nreality as she had in childhood imagined herself capable of being\r\nunder similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nManon's religious feelings were culminated by a request made to her\r\nmother, in a paroxysm of tears, that she might be placed in a\r\nconvent to prepare herself for her first communion; accordingly, she\r\nwas taken to the Convent of the \"Sisters of the Congregation\" in\r\nMay, 1765, when she was eleven years old. Side by side with this\r\nnunnery, where the precocious child passed one of the happiest\r\nepochs of her life, stood the prison which was to immure her in\r\nlater years. Should such a circumstance and situation be unfolded in\r\nthe pages of fiction, we would call it strained and unnatural.\r\n\r\nDuring the year Manon passed in the convent, she made the\r\nacquaintance of two sisters, Henrietta and Sophie Cannet, who were\r\nallied to the nobility; and she afterward attributed her facility in\r\nwriting to the correspondence with the younger of these sisters,\r\nwhich continued without interruption over more than a decade of\r\nyears. In her memoirs, written under the shadow of the guillotine,\r\nshe says, \"In the gloom of a prison, in the midst of political\r\nstorms, how shall I recall to my mind, and how describe, the\r\nrapture, the tranquillity I enjoyed at that period; but when I\r\nreview the events of my life, I find it difficult to assign to\r\ncircumstances that variety and that plenitude of affection which\r\nhave so strongly marked every point of its duration, and left me so\r\nclear a remembrance of every place at which I have been.\"\r\n\r\nAfter she left the convent, she found her passion for reading\r\nunabated, and as her father's library was limited, she was obliged\r\nto borrow and hire books; from these she made copious extracts and\r\nabstracts which formed her valuable habit of reflection upon what\r\nshe had read.\r\n\r\nHer first feelings of contempt and bitterness toward the aristocrats\r\nwere roused by the air of condescension which the Cannets exhibited\r\nto her in her occasional visits to Sophie. They were stupid and\r\narrogant people, but they made her realize that the daughter of an\r\nartisan was not on equal footing with people allied to the nobility,\r\nalbeit she was a prodigy of beauty, learning, and talent, and they\r\nthe dullest of beings.\r\n\r\n\"I endeavored,\" she says, \"to think with hope that everything was\r\nright, but my pride told me things were ordered better in a\r\nrepublic.\" So, as early as at the age of fourteen, we find this\r\nremarkable being philosophizing upon republics, and taking part in\r\nmind against the evils and injustice fostered by monarchies.\r\n\r\nMadame Roland wandered from prescribed creeds, and became a liberal\r\nin her religious ideas. She has been called an Atheist, but every\r\nline she writes, and her life of self-sacrifice, disprove this\r\nassertion. Her \"one prayer,\" to which she says she confined herself,\r\nis, to my mind, sublime with beautiful and practical religion.\r\n\r\n\"O Thou who hast placed me on the earth, enable me to fulfil my\r\ndestination in the manner most conformable to the Divine will, and\r\nmost beneficial to my fellow-creatures.\"\r\n\r\nI can imagine no more perfect religious faith, no more complete\r\nsubmission to, and acknowledgment of, a Supreme Power than this\r\nprayer contains. It strikes me as far more devout and respectful\r\nthan the prayers of many people who endeavor to dictate to God and\r\ndirect Him what to do and what not to do, what to bestow and what to\r\nwithhold.\r\n\r\nShe writes of her religious agitations with great reluctance to\r\nSophie Cannet, fearful of disturbing the serenity of her friend's\r\nconvictions; but she continued to conform to her mother's religious\r\nideas during that good woman's life, and even afterward she kept up\r\nthe forms of Catholicism for the sake of a valued family servant who\r\nwas devoted to her.\r\n\r\nThis delicate consideration of the feelings of others has been\r\nmistaken by some bigoted minds for deceit or vacillation on the part\r\nof Madame Roland; as if such a being were capable of either.\r\n\r\nWe owe all our knowledge of her early private life to the voluminous\r\ncorrespondence between her and Sophie Cannet; to this friend she\r\nwrote those long, journal-like letters, in which one young girl\r\noften pours out the inmost secrets of her heart and soul to another;\r\nbut, unlike the letters of the ordinary girl, Manon's contained\r\ncriticisms of the books she had read, and discussions of\r\nphilosophical subjects, which bear evidence to her wonderful\r\nprecocity of thought and feeling in her \"teens.\"\r\n\r\nOriginality, unselfishness, genius of the rarest order, are all\r\ndisplayed in these letters; already had her mind grasped some great\r\ntruths which it requires the average philosopher half a century to\r\ndiscover, when at seventeen, she says, \"Man is the epitome of the\r\nuniverse. The revolutions of the world without are an image of those\r\nwhich take place in his own soul.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the news of the mortal illness of Louis XV., she writes to\r\nSophie this strongly humanitarian passage: \"Although the obscurity\r\nof my birth, name, and position seem to preclude me from taking any\r\ninterest in the government, yet the common weal touches me in spite\r\nof it. My country is something to me, and the love I bear it is\r\nunquestionable. How could it be otherwise when nothing in the world\r\nis indifferent to me? A love of humanity unites me to everything\r\nthat breathes. A Caribbean interests me; the fate of a Kaffir goes\r\nto my heart. Alexander wished for more worlds to conquer. I could\r\nwish for more to love.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her philosophy, her seriousness, and her learning,\r\nhowever, Manon Philipon was a girl, and a charming one; and we learn\r\nin her letters to Sophie how she was pestered with lovers of low and\r\nhigh degree, during her long maidenhood. I might better say with\r\nproposals for her hand, since, as we know, French custom does not\r\npermit the \"love-making\" which American girls consider their natural\r\nprerogative.\r\n\r\nManon was so beautiful, brilliant, and magnetic, that when she went\r\nout to promenade with her father, she was greeted with admiring\r\nglances and remarks; and from the fruit vender of whom she made\r\noccasional purchases, and the butcher who served the family with\r\njoints, to dancing and drawing masters, up along the line to\r\nmerchants, professional, and literary men, she seemed to fascinate\r\nand attract with no effort on her own part.\r\n\r\nEach one in turn asked for her hand and was rejected; and a host of\r\nothers followed, to meet a similar fate, until her father threatened\r\nto marry her to the first stranger who crossed his portal, whether\r\neither one wished it or no. She says in her memoirs, \"The\r\nrespectable character of my mother, the appearance of some fortune,\r\nand my being an only child, made the project of matrimony a tempting\r\none to a number of persons who were strangers to me. The greater\r\npart, finding it difficult to obtain an introduction, adopted the\r\nexpedient of writing to my father. These letters were always shown\r\nto me. I wrote the answers, which my father faithfully copied. I was\r\nmuch amused at acting the part of my own father, and dismissed my\r\nsuitors with dignity, leaving no room for resentment or hope. Here\r\nbegan to break out those dissensions with my father which lasted\r\never after. He loved and respected commerce, I despised it; and he\r\nwas much concerned at my rejection of suitors who possessed any\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Madame Philipon, which occurred in her daughter's\r\ntwenty-first year, Manon's life at home became almost unbearable.\r\nHer extreme grief impaired her health, and anxiety and mortification\r\nwere added by the excesses and frivolous extravagances into which\r\nher father plunged. He formed associations with people of bad\r\ncharacter, and took to gambling. Manon strove to make herself an\r\nagreeable companion, and to entertain him at home, but the attempt\r\nwas futile. She filled her lonely hours with study, and with writing\r\nletters to Sophie. One day a tall, thin gentleman, bald and yellow,\r\npast forty, and looking older, presented a letter of introduction\r\nfrom Miss Cannet.\r\n\r\nIt was M. Roland, an austere philosopher, of an ancient family, to\r\nwhom Sophie had often referred. Manon admired his intellect and his\r\nrespectability; and when, after some two or three years, he made an\r\noffer of marriage, she was ready to accept; but M. Philipon bluntly\r\nand insolently refused his consent, through a strong personal\r\ndislike which he had conceived for the severe moralist and\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nManon could not marry against her father's wishes, but she could\r\nleave the home now so distasteful to her. She had saved only a small\r\nsum from her mother's fortune, amounting to about one hundred\r\ndollars per year. With this, she retired to the Convent of the\r\nCongregation, and shut herself up with her books, and received only\r\nher old friends.\r\n\r\nM. Roland, for whose sake she had taken so decisive a step, was far\r\nfrom an ardent lover in his conduct at this juncture. He wrote her\r\naffectionately, but he made no reference to his proposal of marriage\r\nuntil six months had passed. Then he came to Paris, had an interview\r\nthrough iron gratings, and expressed himself determined to make her\r\nhis wife. Since she had left her father's roof, she was at liberty\r\nto accept his somewhat tardy proposal, and she emerged from the\r\nconvent to become Madame Roland.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that M. Roland was not an ardent lover, and it is\r\nreadily understood that this beautiful, intense girl, in the very\r\nprime of young womanhood, was not in love with him. She felt only\r\nesteem for his virtues, and admiration for his intellect. But she\r\nwas twenty-five years old, and virtually homeless; of all the score\r\nof men who had sought her hand in marriage, no one had ever stirred\r\nher heart, and she married, believing, no doubt, that this cold\r\nregard and high admiration which the character of M. Roland\r\nelicited, was all that she could feel for any man.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the thunders of the Revolution shook the world,\r\nthat her heart awoke to real passion; and even then, in a situation\r\nwhere hundreds of women who have professed greater religious fervor,\r\nhave fallen, she conquered herself, and virtually died to protect\r\nher husband's life.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of their marriage, the Rolands lived in Paris.\r\nManon had imagined a happy association with her friends, the\r\nCannets; but her husband was morbidly jealous of these friends, and\r\nextracted a promise from her that she would see them as little as\r\npossible. She became his amanuensis and secretary, and scarcely ever\r\nleft his side.\r\n\r\nDuring the next ten years we find her passing the greater part of\r\nher time in the Clos de la Platière, an ancient and humble\r\ncountry-seat belonging to the Roland family. Here, with her taxing\r\ndomestic duties, the exactions of her husband, the care of her child\r\nEudora, the tyrannies of her aged mother-in-law, this wonderful\r\nwoman had little opportunity for the exercise of her talents.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange to think of this beautiful martyr, whose name is a\r\nsynonym for all that is grand and heroic, passing the best years of\r\nher womanhood in preparing dishes for the appetite of a dyspeptic\r\nhusband, in looking after house-linen, and arranging lessons for a\r\nchild. Matilda Blind says \"This affects one with something of the\r\nludicrous disproportion of making use of the fires of Etna to fry\r\none's eggs by.\"\r\n\r\nYet Madame Roland performed these and less agreeable duties as\r\ncheerfully and as perfectly as she had performed her chosen tasks in\r\nthe convent years before. Women doctors were not known in those\r\ndays, but the genius of Madame Roland embraced a knowledge of\r\nmedicine with other things; and she often went three leagues to\r\nrelieve a sick peasant, and was ever ready to sacrifice herself for\r\nthe good of others.\r\n\r\nThere was very little happiness for her in the companionship of her\r\nhusband. He was twenty-two years her senior, and possessed an\r\nimperious temper and an exacting nature. But the most ardent wife\r\ncould not have better performed her duty to the most lovable of\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\nNaturally democratic in her feelings and sympathies, Madame Roland\r\ntook the keenest interest in the progress of the Revolution; from\r\nher quiet retreat she studied its leading members, and when, in\r\n1791, her husband was chosen deputy to the Constituent Assembly, she\r\naccompanied him to Paris, and their apartments became the rendezvous\r\nfor such men as Brissot, Buzot, Danton, Robespierre, Pétion, and\r\nmany more, who met to confer with one another and to exchange ideas\r\nand suggestions. Madame Roland sat apart with her embroidery and\r\nlistened. Of these meetings she speaks thus in her \"Memoirs\": \"Good\r\nideas were started and excellent principles maintained; but there\r\nwas no path marked out, no determinate point toward which each\r\nperson should direct his views. Sometimes for very vexation, I could\r\nhave boxed the ears of these philosophers.\"\r\n\r\nHad not her sex precluded this silent spirit of the Girondists from\r\ntaking part in these counsels, if, instead of acting second hand\r\nthrough her husband, she could have taken the lead, as her genius,\r\nperception, honesty, and courage entitled her to do, who knows that\r\nshe might not have averted the disasters which befell the party\r\nthrough its dissensions.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1792, Roland was elected minister of the interior; and\r\nMadame Roland presided over the establishment that had been\r\nsumptuously fitted up for Madame Necker. Roland became the idol of\r\nthe patriotic party, and was enchanted with his excellent position.\r\nHe urged upon King Louis XVI., in whom he reposed great faith, the\r\nnecessity of a decree against the priesthood, and the establishment\r\nof a camp in the suburbs of Paris. Louis demurred, Roland insisted\r\nin the famous letter written by his wife, and placed in the king's\r\nhands June 11th. This letter became immensely popular. The Assembly\r\nordered it to be printed and copies sent to all departments,\r\ntogether with expressions of national regret at the discharge of\r\nRoland and his friends, which the letter caused. But they were\r\nrecalled to office after the dreadful August 10th.\r\n\r\nTwice a week Madame Roland gave a dinner to fifteen of her husband's\r\ncolleagues, with whom he wished to converse. No other lady was\r\npresent. The Girondists were at the apex of society, and Madame\r\nRoland was the life and impetus of the party. She endeavored to\r\ninfuse its members with her hatred of false pride and old\r\nprejudices, and with her desire to establish a liberal democracy.\r\nAlways enthusiastic, and vexed with the lack of unity and direct\r\npurpose in the Assembly, she was over-zealous in some of her\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nAmong the brilliant men whom she entertained at these dinners, was\r\none, young, handsome, elegant, and refined, whose many manly\r\nqualities woke in her heart that long-delayed passion which a nature\r\nso ardent must sometime feel. This man was Buzot; and he was as\r\nirresistibly drawn to this beautiful, brilliant woman as the magnet\r\nto the steel.\r\n\r\nMadame Roland was at this time thirty-eight years old; her brilliant\r\ncolor and her open expression made her look much younger, and her\r\ntall, finely developed form, her splendid eyes and engaging smile,\r\ncharmed and attracted all who came near her. But though domestic\r\nlife and morality were held at the lowest possible value in those\r\nchaotic days, and each man made a law for himself, Madame Roland\r\nnever wavered in her loyalty and devotion to the man whose name she\r\nbore. Only through her remarkable letters written to Buzot from her\r\nprison cell, and never made public till 1863, does the glory and\r\nintensity of her hopeless passion display itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first, Madame Roland had distrusted Danton. It was not\r\nlong before her intuitions proved correct, for Danton soon showed\r\nhis jealousy and dislike of the minister, whom he found too honest\r\nto tamper with. He feared, too, the penetration, frankness, and\r\ngenius of Roland's wife. Men who saw the insidious, selfish\r\nqualities of Danton, began to cultivate and conciliate him out of\r\nfear of his enmity.\r\n\r\nRobespierre, whom Madame Roland had at first believed in as an\r\nhonest friend to liberty, became an ally of Danton and Marat, and\r\nRoland soon realized that it was not the monarchists he had to\r\ncontend against, but the new party headed by these dissenting\r\nGirondists, who were savage with a thirst for human blood.\r\n\r\nThe Rolands were accused of trying to establish an aristocracy of\r\ntalent on the ruins of a monarchical aristocracy; their semi-weekly\r\ndinners were represented as sumptuous feasts where, like a new\r\nCirce, Madame Roland strove to corrupt the unfortunates who partook\r\nof her banquets.\r\n\r\nShe was called before the Convention December 7th, to listen to the\r\ncharges against her; her eloquence won the admiration of even her\r\nenemies. But her safety was in danger, and she was obliged to sleep\r\nwith a pistol under her pillow for fear of the outrages of\r\ndesperadoes who lurked about her house.\r\n\r\nThe strife between the two parties grew more bitter, and the\r\ndownfall of Roland had been determined upon by his savage opponents,\r\nonce his fawning friends and colleagues. An attempt was made to\r\narrest Roland by six armed men, deputies of the Insurrectionists. He\r\nreplied that he did not recognize their authority, and refused to\r\nfollow them. Madame Roland at once set off for the Tuileries, where\r\nthe Insurrectionists, more cruel and blood-thirsty than the deposed\r\nMonarchists, were in session. At the door the sentinels forbade her\r\nto enter. Obliged to return home without having been enabled to\r\naddress the Convention, as she hoped to do, she found that her\r\nhusband had taken refuge in the house of a friend.\r\n\r\nShe sought him out, embraced him, and returned once more to the\r\nTuileries in another vain hope of arousing their former friends to\r\nresolute action. But she was obliged to return to her apartment in\r\nthe evening, without having accomplished anything. Late that night\r\nshe was torn from her child and her home, and cast into the Prison\r\nof the Abbaye, from which she was set at liberty a month later, and\r\nwild with happiness, allowed to reach her own door; but as she\r\nattempted to enter she was again seized and conveyed to the Prison\r\nof Sainte Pélagie. The respite had only been given in malice to\r\nrender her second incarceration more bitter.\r\n\r\nUnder the same roof were murderers and women of the town; and in the\r\nmorning, when the cell-doors were opened, the scum of the earth, as\r\none authority tells us, collected in the corridor. On each side of\r\nthis corridor (the only place where the prisoners could take\r\nexercise) were small cells, and one of these, separated only by thin\r\nwalls from the most depraved beings, whose vile language was\r\nconstantly audible to her ears, this refined and elegant woman was\r\nforced to occupy. She suffered acutely from this proximity to\r\ndepravity and vulgarity at first; but ere long she transformed the\r\nvicinity in which her cell was situated \"from an inferno to an oasis\r\nof peace.\" When she walked in the corridor, where at first she was\r\npointed at, abused and reviled, she was now surrounded by wretched\r\nbeings who clung to her skirts and regarded her as a divinity. Her\r\nsweet voice soothed brawls, her words of courage inspired the most\r\nhopeless. Everybody loved her, everybody desired her acquittal.\r\n\r\nMeantime she was writing her famous \"Memoirs,\" and the touching\r\nletters to her husband, her child, and to Buzot. After an\r\nimprisonment of more than six months, she was finally called before\r\nthe judge and the prosecution, and accused of being the wife of\r\nRoland, the conspirator, the friend of his accomplices. Twenty-one\r\nGirondists had already been executed, and she could not hope to\r\nescape. She was condemned to death as guilty of traitorous relations\r\nwith conspirators. She heard the sentence proudly, and replied, \"You\r\nconsider me worthy to share the fate of the great men whom you have\r\nassassinated. I shall try to carry to the scaffold the courage they\r\nhave shown.\"\r\n\r\nRobespierre signed her death-warrant. He had been her friend, guest,\r\nand correspondent. She had helped him when he was unknown, defended\r\nhim when he was in need of a defender. But he sent her to the\r\nscaffold; and on November 9, 1793, the tumbril came to convey her to\r\nthe guillotine. It had taken many others on that same day; and now\r\nher only companion on that fatal ride was a trembling old man named\r\nLa Marche. He wept bitterly, but Madame Roland cheered him with\r\nwords of courage and strength.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the Place de la Concorde, she begged the\r\nexecutioner to permit the \"etiquette of the scaffold\" to be waived,\r\nand to allow La Marche to die first, that the sight of her death\r\nmight not accentuate his fear and misery. So to the last moment of\r\nher life she was true to her religion of thoughtfulness for others.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, self-possessed, and calm, she stood upon the scaffold in\r\nthe pride of her womanhood, and spoke those last immortal words as\r\nshe lifted her eyes to the statue of Liberty, \"O Liberty, how many\r\ncrimes are committed in thy name.\"\r\n\r\nThen the axe fell, and the assassins of the Revolution had added\r\nanother victim to their list. Seven days after this event, M. Roland\r\ncommitted suicide by stabbing himself through the heart.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Ella Wheeler Wilcox.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE ANTOINETTE\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. OCTAVIUS FREIRE OWEN\r\n\r\n(1755-1793)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marie Antoinette.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa, the Empress of Austria, was not highly educated; and\r\nshe was incapable of directing the studies of her children, although\r\nby precept and example she laid the foundation of characters, all of\r\nwhich became more or less remarkable. Marie Antoinette, her youngest\r\nchild, was perhaps the most neglected. She once innocently caused\r\nthe dismissal of her governess, through a confession that all the\r\nletters and drawings shown to her mother, in proof of her\r\nimprovement, had been previously traced with a pencil. At fifteen\r\nher knowledge of Italian, studied under Metastasio, was the only\r\nbranch of her education which had been fairly attended to, if we\r\nexcept considerable conversance with the \"Lives of the Saints\" and\r\nother legendary lore, the favorite fictions of monastic compilers.\r\nNature had, nevertheless, done much for the young archduchess; she\r\npossessed great facility for learning, and was not slow in taking\r\nadvantage of opportunities for improvement when they were afforded.\r\nIn person she was most attractive. \"Beaming with freshness,\" says\r\nMadame Campan, \"she appeared to all eyes more than beautiful. Her\r\nwalk partook at once of the noble character of the princesses of her\r\nhouse and of the graces of the French; her eyes were mild, her smile\r\nlovely. It was impossible to refrain from admiring her aërial\r\ndeportment; her smile was sufficient to win the heart; and in this\r\nenchanting being, in whom the splendor of French gayety shone forth,\r\nan indescribable but august serenity--perhaps, also, the somewhat\r\nproud position of her head and shoulders--betrayed the daughter of\r\nthe Cæsars.\" Such, according to her affectionate chronicler,\r\nappeared Marie Antoinette, when her nuptials were celebrated at\r\nVersailles with the Dauphin of France.\r\n\r\nSuperstitious minds discovered fatal omens from the earliest years\r\nof the hapless dauphiness. She had begun ill by first drawing breath\r\nupon the very day of the earthquake of Lisbon; this made a great\r\nimpression on the mother, and later upon the child also. Another\r\nincident was not less discouraging: the empress had \"protected a\r\nperson named Gassner,\" who fancied himself inspired, and affected to\r\npredict events. \"Tell me,\" she said to him one day, \"whether my\r\nAntoinette will be happy?\" At first Gassner turned pale and remained\r\nsilent, but, urged by the empress, and dreading to distress her by\r\nhis own fancies, he said, equivocally, \"Madame, there are crosses\r\nfor all shoulders.\" Goethe notices that a pavilion erected to\r\nreceive Marie Antoinette and her suite in the neighborhood of\r\nStrasburg was lined with tapestry depicting the story of Jason, \"the\r\nmost fatal union\" on record; and a few days later, when the young\r\nqueen arrived from Versailles to witness the rejoicings of the\r\npeople upon her marriage, she was compelled to fly, terrified, from\r\na scene remarkable not for festivity and happiness, but for the\r\nvariety and horror of its accidents. These circumstances threw a\r\ngloom over the prospective triumphs of the impressionable bride; but\r\nher nature and age were alike favorable to vivacity, and she shook\r\noff the morbid influence.\r\n\r\nSomething of her mother's wise advice to her as to the course she\r\nshould follow in her new position has been preserved in the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR DAUGHTER:\r\n\r\n\"... Do not take any recommendations; listen to no one, if you would\r\nbe at peace. Have no curiosity,--this is a fault which I fear\r\ngreatly for you; avoid all familiarity with your inferiors. Ask of\r\nMonsieur and Madame de Noailles, and even exact of them, under all\r\ncircumstances, advice as to what, as a foreigner and being desirous\r\nof pleasing the nation, you should do, and that they should tell you\r\nfrankly if there be anything in your bearing, discourse, or any\r\npoint which you should correct. Reply amiably to every one, and with\r\ngrace and dignity; you can if you will. You must learn to refuse....\r\nAfter Strasburg you must accept nothing without taking counsel of\r\nMonsieur and Madame de Noailles; and you should refer to them every\r\none who would speak to you of his personal affairs, saying frankly\r\nthat being a stranger yourself, you cannot undertake to recommend\r\nany one to the king. If you wish you may add, in order to make your\r\nreply more emphatic, 'The empress, my mother, has expressly\r\nforbidden me to undertake any recommendations.' Do not be ashamed to\r\nask advice of any one, and do nothing on your own responsibility....\r\nIn the king you will find a tender father who will also be your\r\nfriend if you deserve it. Put entire confidence in him; you will run\r\nno risk. Love him, obey him, seek to divine his thoughts; you cannot\r\ndo enough on this moment when I am losing you.... Concerning the\r\ndauphin I shall say nothing; you know my delicacy on this point. A\r\nwife should be submissive in everything to her husband, and should\r\nhave no thought but to please him and do his will.... The only true\r\nhappiness in this world lies in a happy marriage; I know whereof I\r\nspeak. Everything depends on the wife if she be yielding, sweet, and\r\namusing.... I counsel you, my dear daughter, to reread this letter\r\non the twenty-first of every month. I beg you to be true to me on\r\nthis point. My only fear for you is negligence in your prayers and\r\nstudies; and lukewarmness succeeds negligence. Fight against it, for\r\nit is more dangerous than a more reprehensible, even wicked state;\r\none can conquer that more easily. Love your family; be affectionate\r\nto them--to your aunts as well as to your brothers-in-law and\r\nsisters-in-law. Suffer no evil-speaking; you must either silence the\r\npersons, or escape it by withdrawing from them. If you value your\r\npeace of mind, you must from the start avoid this pitfall, which I\r\ngreatly fear for you knowing your curiosity....\r\n\r\n  \"Your mother,\r\n                         \"MARIA-THERESA.\"\r\n\r\nThe grand annoyance Marie Antoinette experienced upon her entrance\r\ninto the French Court, was the necessity of observing a system of\r\netiquette to which she had been unaccustomed, and soon pronounced,\r\nwith girlish vehemence, insupportable. Barrière copies a ridiculous\r\nanecdote in illustration of this from the manuscript fragments of\r\nMadame Campan: \"Madame de Noailles\" (this was the first lady of\r\nhonor to the dauphiness) \"abounded in virtues; I cannot pretend to\r\ndeny it. Her piety, charity, and irreproachable morals rendered her\r\nworthy of praise, but etiquette was to her a sort of atmosphere; at\r\nthe slightest derangement of the consecrated order, one would have\r\nthought she would have been stifled, and that life would forsake her\r\nframe. One day I unintentionally threw this poor lady into a\r\nterrible agony. The queen was receiving I know not whom--some\r\npersons just presented, I believe; the lady of honor, the queen's\r\ntire-woman, and the ladies of the bed-chamber were behind the queen.\r\nI was near the throne with the two women on duty. All was right; at\r\nleast, I thought so. Suddenly I perceived the eyes of Madame de\r\nNoailles fixed on mine. She made a sign with her head, and then\r\nraised her eyebrows to the top of her forehead, lowered them, raised\r\nthem again, then began to make little signs with her hand. From all\r\nthis pantomime, I could easily perceive that something was not as it\r\nshould be; as I looked about on all sides to find out what it was,\r\nthe agitation of the countess kept increasing. The queen, who\r\nperceived all this, looked at me with a smile. I found means to\r\napproach her Majesty, who said to me in a whisper: '_Let down your\r\nlappets, or the countess will expire._' All this bustle arose from\r\ntwo unlucky pins, which fastened up my lappets, while the etiquette\r\nof costume said '_Lappets hanging down_.'\"\r\n\r\nTo the Countess de Noailles Marie Antoinette speedily gave the name\r\nof Madame l'Étiquette; this pleasantry the object of it could\r\npardon, not so the French nation. The avowed dislike to ceremony\r\nmanifested by the lively little dauphiness, her desire to substitute\r\nthe simple manners of her native Vienna for the stately formality of\r\nVersailles, displeased more than her genuine condescension and\r\naffability attracted. Early also in her married life, to beguile the\r\nheavy tedium of their evenings, she instituted a variety of childish\r\ngames which became talked of and condemned; she liked theatrical\r\nrepresentations, and persuaded her two young brothers-in-law, with\r\nthe princesses, to join her in performing plays, and though they\r\nwere kept secret for a time, she suffered for her innocent\r\ncontrivances in public opinion. It must be remembered that Marie\r\nAntoinette had no sincere friends upon her arrival in France, except\r\nthe Duc de Choiseul and his party, and his disgrace prevented her\r\nderiving much benefit from the man who had first negotiated her\r\nmarriage. The house of Austria was looked upon with dislike and\r\ndoubt; nor were these, even in the case of the young dauphin's aunt,\r\nMadame Adelaide, made a matter of concealment. Thus, at her entrance\r\nupon public life, Antoinette was met with cynicism and prejudice,\r\nand unfortunately her own conduct rather increased than quieted the\r\ninsidious voice--the \"_bruit sourd_\"--of both.\r\n\r\nLouis XV. had manifested from the first great pleasure in the\r\nsociety of his grandson's bride. After dining in his apartment at\r\nthe Tuileries, upon her arrival at Paris, she was obliged to\r\nacknowledge the shouts of the multitude, which filled the garden\r\nbelow, by presenting herself on the balcony. The Governor of Paris\r\nhad told her politely at the time, that \"these were so many lovers.\"\r\nLittle did she think that at the very moment a strong party around\r\nher was planning her divorce, under the supposition that the\r\ndauphin's coldness to his bride proceeded from dislike. Louis was a\r\ntimid, though rough, youth at the time, and for a considerable\r\nperiod treated the attractions which the courtiers so highly\r\nextolled, with churlish indifference. The French king, indeed, did\r\nhis best to promote a better understanding, and when the reserve of\r\nthe dauphin once thawed, the latter became tenderly attached to her,\r\nand greatly improved by her influence and society.\r\n\r\nAn interesting trait of this youthful pair is told, as occurring at\r\nthe moment when they might have been excused for entertaining other\r\nand more selfish thoughts. They were expecting the intelligence of\r\nthe death of Louis XV. It had been agreed, as the disorder was one\r\nfrightfully contagious, that the court should depart immediately\r\nupon learning it could be of no further assistance, and that a\r\nlighted taper, placed in the window of the dying monarch's chamber,\r\nshould form a signal for the cavalcade to prepare for the journey.\r\nThe taper was extinguished; a tumult of voices and advancing feet\r\nwere heard in the outer apartment. \"It was the crowd of courtiers\r\ndeserting the dead sovereign's ante-chamber, to come and bow to the\r\nnew power of Louis XVI.\" With a spontaneous impulse the dauphin and\r\nhis bride threw themselves upon their knees, and shedding a torrent\r\nof tears, exclaimed, \"O God! guide us, protect us; we are too young\r\nto govern.\" Thus the Countess de Noailles found them as she entered,\r\nthe first to salute Marie Antoinette as Queen of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marie Antoinette.]\r\n\r\nFor some time the young queen's liking for children was ungratified by\r\nthe possession of any of her own, and this gave rise to an amusing\r\nattempt to adopt one belonging to others. One day, when she was\r\ndriving near Luciennes, a little peasant boy fell under the horses'\r\nfeet, and might have been killed. The queen took him to Versailles,\r\nappointed him a nurse, and installed him in the royal apartments,\r\nconstantly seating him in her lap at breakfast and dinner. This child\r\nafterward grew up a most sanguinary revolutionist! It was nine years\r\nbefore Marie Antoinette had the blessing of any offspring; four\r\nchildren were after that interval, born to her, two of whom died in\r\ntheir infancy, and two survived to share their parent's subsequent\r\nimprisonment. The sad history of her son's fate, a promising and\r\nattractive boy, is well known.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the Austrian princess was no favorite with her\r\nhusband's nation. After a time accusations as unjust as serious\r\nassailed her, and in the horrors of the succeeding revolution the\r\npopular feeling evinced itself in a hundred frightful ways. Louis\r\nXVI., a mild prince, averse to violence or bloodshed, was unfit to\r\nstem the tide of opposition; had he possessed the energy of his\r\nqueen, the Reign of Terror had perhaps never existed. Throughout her\r\nmisfortunes, in every scene of flight, of opprobrium, and\r\ndesolation, her magnanimity and courage won, even from the ruffians\r\naround, occasional expressions of sympathy. A harrowing and\r\nmelancholy history is hers, and one which has been often vividly\r\nnarrated; its details, also, are sufficiently recent to be still\r\nfresh within the recollection of many. For these reasons, and\r\nfurther because it seems to us a repellent, if not a mischievous,\r\nact to amplify such records before advancing age shall have invested\r\nthem to the mind with deeper significance, we gladly pass over the\r\npicture suggested by this dark historical page, and, resuming the\r\nnarrative where Madame de Campan drops it, content ourselves with a\r\ndescription of the last scene in the terrible drama.\r\n\r\nWhen this devoted woman left her royal mistress in the miserable\r\ncell at the Convent of the Feuillans, she never again saw her.\r\nImprisonment, and the intense grief she experienced, more for others\r\nthan for herself, completely transformed the once beautiful queen;\r\nher hair was prematurely silvered, like that of Mary Stuart, her\r\nfigure bowed, her voice low and tremulous. Then came the separation\r\nfrom the king. Once more only did her eyes again behold him, and\r\nafter the parting between the dethroned monarch and his adoring\r\nfamily, he might indeed have been able to say, \"The bitterness of\r\ndeath was passed.\" However weak at intervals, the unhappy Louis met\r\nhis death heroically. The sufferings of his wife at the time when\r\nthe guns boomed out the fearful catastrophe, may be supposed to have\r\nbeen as great as the human frame has power to endure. Shortly after,\r\nshe was separated from her children and conveyed to the prison of\r\nthe Conciergerie, a damp and loathsome place, whence she was\r\nsummoned one morning in October to receive a sentence for which it\r\nis probable she ardently longed. Let us look at her through the bars\r\nof her prison upon her return thither after it was pronounced.\r\n\r\nIt is four o'clock in the morning. The widowed Queen of France\r\nstands calm and resigned in her cell, listening with a melancholy\r\nsmile to the tumult of the mob outside. A faint illumination\r\nannounces the approach of day; it is the last she has to live!\r\nSeating herself at a table she writes, with hurried hand, a last\r\nletter of ardent tenderness to the sister of her husband, the pious\r\nMadame Elizabeth, and to her children; and now she passionately\r\npresses the insensible paper to her lips, as the sole remaining link\r\nbetween those dear ones and herself. She stops, sighs, and throws\r\nherself upon her miserable pallet. What! in such an hour as this can\r\nthe queen sleep? Even so!\r\n\r\nAnd now look up, daughter of the Cæsars! Thou art waked from dreams\r\nof hope and light, from the imaged embrace of thy beloved Louis, thy\r\ntender infants, by a kind voice, choked by tears. Arise! emancipated\r\none, thy prison doors are open. Freedom, freedom is at hand!\r\n\r\nImmediately in front of the palace of the Tuileries--scene of the\r\nshort months of her wedded happiness--there rises a dark, ominous\r\nmass. Around is a sea of human faces; above, the cold frown of a\r\nwinter's sky. With a firm step the victim ascends the stairs of the\r\nscaffold, her white garments wave in the chill breeze, a black ribbon\r\nby which her cap is confined beats to and fro against her pale cheeks.\r\nYou may see that she is unmindful of her executioners--she glances,\r\nnay, almost smiles, at the sharp edge of the guillotine, and then\r\nturning her eyes toward the Temple, utters, in a few agitated words,\r\nher last earthly farewell to Louis and her children. There is a\r\nhush--a stillness of the grave--for the very headsman trembles as the\r\nhorrible blade falls--anon, a moment's delay. And now, look! No,\r\nrather veil your eyes from the dreadful sight; close your ears to that\r\nfiendish shout--_Vive la République!_ It is over! the sacrifice is\r\naccomplished! the weary spirit is at rest!\r\n\r\nLet us dwell upon this last mournful pageant only sufficiently far\r\nas to imitate the virtues, and emulate the firmness and resignation\r\nwith which she met her doom. Nothing is permitted without a meaning,\r\nall is for either warning or example; and while breathing a prayer\r\nthat Heaven may avert a recurrence of such outrages, let us remember\r\nthat moral indecision, the undue love of pleasure, and an aimless,\r\nprofitless mode of life, as surely, and not less fatally, may raise\r\nthe surging tide of events no human skill can quell, as the most\r\nselfish abandonment to uncontrolled desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREAS HOFER\r\n\r\n(1767-1810)\r\n\r\n\r\nAndreas Hofer, a native of the village of St. Leonard, in the valley\r\nof Passeyr, was born on November 22, 1767. During the greater part\r\nof his life he resided peaceably in his own neighborhood, where he\r\nkept an inn, and increased his profits by dealing in wine, corn, and\r\ncattle. About his neck he wore at all times a small crucifix and a\r\nmedal of St. George. He never held any rank in the Austrian army;\r\nbut he had formed a secret connection with the Archduke John, when\r\nthat prince had passed a few weeks in the Tyrol making scientific\r\nresearches. In November, 1805, Hofer was appointed deputy from his\r\nnative valley at the conference of Brunnecken, and again at a second\r\nconference, held at Vienna, in January, 1809.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Andreas Hofer.]\r\n\r\nThe Tyrol had for many years been an appendage of the Austrian\r\nstates, and the inhabitants had become devoted to that government;\r\nso that when, by the treaty of Presburg, the province was\r\ntransferred to the rule of the King of Bavaria, then the ally of\r\nNapoleon I., the peasants were greatly irritated, and their\r\ndiscontent was further provoked by the large and frequent exactions\r\nwhich the continual wars obliged the new government to levy on the\r\nTyrolese. The consequence was, that when their own neighborhood\r\nbecame the theatre of military operations between Austria and\r\nFrance, in the spring of 1809, a general insurrection broke out in\r\nthe Tyrol. His resolution of character, natural eloquence, and\r\nprivate influence as a wealthy citizen, joined to a figure of great\r\nstature and strength, pointed out Andreas Hofer to his countrymen as\r\nthe leader of this revolt; and with him were united Spechbacher,\r\nJoseph Haspinger, and Martin Teimer, whose names have all become\r\nhistorical. A perfect understanding was maintained between the\r\ninsurgents and their late masters, and the signal of the\r\ninsurrection was given by the Archduke John in a proclamation from\r\nhis head-quarters at Klagenfurth. An Austrian army of 10,000 men,\r\ncommanded by the Marquis Castellar, was directed to enter the Tyrol\r\nand support the insurrection, which broke out in every quarter on\r\nthe night of April 8, 1809. The Austrian general himself crossed the\r\nfrontier at daybreak on the 9th. On their side the Bavarians marched\r\nan army of 25,000 men into the province to quell the revolt. Hofer\r\nand his band of armed peasantry fell upon the Bavarians while\r\nentangled in the narrow glens, and on April 10th defeated Besson and\r\nLemoine at the Sterzinger Moos. The next day a troop of peasants\r\nunder Teimer took possession of Innsbrück. On the 12th Besson\r\nsurrendered with his division of 3,000 men. In a single week all the\r\nfortresses were recovered, nearly 10,000 troops of the enemy were\r\ndestroyed, and the whole province was redeemed.\r\n\r\nIncensed by this interruption of his plans, Napoleon despatched\r\nthree armies almost simultaneously to assail the province at three\r\ndifferent points. One of these forces was under the command of\r\nMarshal Lefebvre, who, on May 12th, defeated the united army of the\r\nAustrian soldiers, under Castellar, and the Tyrolese peasantry,\r\nunder Haspinger and Spechbacher, at Feuer Singer. The troops made a\r\nbad use of their victory, slaughtering the inhabitants of the\r\nvillages on their route, without distinction of age or sex. The\r\nBavarian and French officers encouraged and took part in the\r\nexcesses of the soldiers; while the insurgents, far from\r\nretaliating, refrained from every species of license, and nursed\r\ntheir wounded prisoners with the same care as their own friends.\r\nHofer himself was not always present in action, his talent\r\nconsisting rather in stimulating his countrymen than in actual\r\nfighting; but at the battle of Innsbrück (May 28, 1809), he led the\r\nTyrolese, exhibited both skill and daring, and defeated the\r\nBavarians with a loss of 4,000 men. The whole of the Tyrol was\r\ndelivered a second time. But after the battle of Wagram (July 6th),\r\nand the armistice of Znaim which immediately followed, the Austrian\r\narmy was obliged to evacuate the Tyrol, leaving the helpless\r\ninsurgents to the mercy of an exasperated enemy. Marshal Lefebvre\r\nnow invaded the province a second time, and entered it by the road\r\nfrom Salzburg, with an army of 21,000 troops, while Beaumont, having\r\ncrossed the ridge of Schnartz with a force 10,000 strong, threatened\r\nInnsbrück from the north. On July 30th Innsbrück submitted. A series\r\nof desperate contests followed along the line of the Brenner, mostly\r\nwith doubtful success, but in one the marshal was defeated, when\r\ntwenty-five pieces of artillery and a quantity of ammunition fell\r\ninto the hands of the Tyrolese. Again, on August 12th, Marshal\r\nLefebvre, with an army of 25,000 Bavarian and French soldiers, 2,000\r\nof whom were cavalry, was totally beaten by the Tyrolese army,\r\nconsisting of 18,000 armed peasants. The battle, which was fought\r\nnear Innsbrück, is said to have lasted from six in the morning until\r\nmidnight. For a third time the Tyrol was free.\r\n\r\nAfter this victory, entirely achieved by the peasantry themselves,\r\nHofer became the absolute ruler of the country; coins were struck\r\nwith his effigy, and proclamations issued in his name. His power,\r\nhowever, scarcely lasted two months, and became the cause of his\r\nruin ultimately. Three veteran armies, comprising a force of nearly\r\n50,000 French and Bavarian troops, were despatched in October to\r\nsubdue the exhausted province; and, unable to make head against\r\nthem, Hofer was obliged to take refuge in the mountains. Soon after,\r\na price having been set on his head, a pretended friend (a priest\r\nnamed Donay) was induced to betray him, January 20, 1810. After his\r\narrest he was conveyed to Mantua, and the intelligence having been\r\ncommunicated by telegraph to the French emperor, an order was\r\ninstantly returned that he must be tried. This order was a sentence;\r\nand after a court-martial, at which, however, the majority were\r\naverse to a sentence of death, Hofer was condemned to be shot. His\r\nexecution took place on February 20, 1810, his whole military career\r\nhaving occupied less than forty weeks. The Emperor Francis conferred\r\na handsome pension upon the widow and family of Hofer, and created\r\nHofer's son a noble. The Austrian government also raised a marble\r\nstatue of heroic size in the cathedral of Innsbrück, where the body\r\nof the patriot was interred; while his own countrymen have\r\ncommemorated his efforts by raising a small pyramid to mark the spot\r\nwhere he was taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Andreas Hofer led to Execution.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN LOUISE OF PRUSSIA\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. FRANCIS G. FAITHFULL\r\n\r\n(1776-1810)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen Louise of Prussia.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is at Paretz, near Potsdam, a flower-bordered walk leading\r\nfrom a grotto overlooking the Havel to an iron gate, above which is\r\ninscribed \"May 20, 1810\" and the letter \"L.\" Within the grotto an\r\niron table bears in golden characters, \"Remember the Absent.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were engraved by order of Friedrich Wilhelm III. of\r\nPrussia; and the \"absent\" he would have remembered--\"the star of his\r\nlife, who had lighted him so truly on his darkened way\"--was the\r\nwife who died of a broken heart before reaching middle age.\r\n\r\nLouise Augusta Wilhelmina, third daughter of Duke Charles of\r\nMecklenburg-Strelitz, was born on March 10, 1776, in the city of\r\nHanover. Her mother died when she was six years old, and henceforth\r\nshe and her sister Frederica lived with their grandmother, the\r\nLandgravine of Darmstadt, sometimes at the Burgfreiheit Palace,\r\nsometimes at a château in the Herrengarten, surrounded by formal\r\ngardens and orangeries. The girls were brought up simply, making\r\ntheir own clothes, and going much among the poor. Now and then they\r\nmade expeditions to Strasburg or the Vosges Mountains; and, when the\r\nEmperor Leopold was crowned at Frankfort, the Frau von Goethe housed\r\nthem hospitably, and was highly entertained by the glee with which\r\nthey worked a quaint sculptured pump in her courtyard. Two years\r\nlater the advance of French troops compelled them to seek refuge\r\nwith their eldest sister, the reigning Duchess of Hildburghausen;\r\nand on their homeward way they visited the Prussian head-quarters,\r\nthat the Landgravine might present them to the king. His sons were\r\nwith him, and long afterward the Crown Prince told a friend, \"I felt\r\nwhen I saw her, 'tis she or none on earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe wooing was short. On April 24, 1793, he exchanged betrothal\r\nrings with Louise, and then rejoined his regiment. Soon after, the\r\nPrincesses of Mecklenburg went over to the camp, Louise appearing \"a\r\nheavenly vision\" in the eyes of Goethe, who saw her there.\r\n\r\nIn the December of that same year Berlin, gay with flags and ablaze\r\nwith colored lamps, welcomed Duke Charles and his daughters; and on\r\nChristmas Eve the diamond crown of the Hohenzollerns was placed on\r\nher fair head, and in her glistening silver robe she took part in\r\nthe solemn torch procession round the White Saloon.\r\n\r\nThen her young husband took her home to their palace in the \"Unter\r\nden Linden.\" They were very happy. In the sunshine of his wife's\r\npresence the prince's spirit, crushed in childhood by a harsh tutor,\r\nsoon revived, while Louise, though the darling of the court, was\r\nalways most content when alone with him.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! you are my wife again,\" he exclaimed, one day, when she\r\nhad laid aside her jewels.\r\n\r\n\"Am I not always your wife?\" she asked, laughingly.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! no; too often you can be only the crown princess.\"\r\n\r\nHer father-in-law never wearied of showering kindnesses on his\r\n\"Princess of Princesses.\" On her eighteenth birthday he asked if she\r\ndesired anything he could give. \"A handful of gold for the Berlin\r\npoor,\" was the prompt petition.\r\n\r\n\"And how large a handful would the birthday child like?\"\r\n\r\n\"As large as the heart of the kindest of kings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Castle of Charlottenberg, one of his many gifts to the young\r\npair, proving too splendid for their simple tastes, he bought for\r\nthem the Manor of Paretz, about two miles from Potsdam. There Louise\r\nbusied herself with household affairs, while her husband gardened,\r\nstrolled over his fields, or inspected his farm stock. They played\r\nand sang together, or read Shakespeare and Goethe, while to complete\r\nthis home-life came two baby boys: Fritz, born in October, 1795, and\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm, in March, 1797. Someone once asked Louise if this\r\ncountry existence was not rather dull. \"Oh! no,\" she exclaimed; \"I\r\nam quite happy as the worthy lady of Paretz.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the late autumn of 1797 the king died, and the quiet freedom\r\nof Paretz had to be exchanged for the restraints of court life.\r\nLittle as either of the two desired regal pomp, they played their\r\nnew parts well. Friedrich Wilhelm, stately in bearing, and\r\nacknowledged as the handsomest man in his realm, looked every inch a\r\nking; and if his laconic speech and caustic criticisms sometimes\r\ngave offence, the winning gentleness of his beautiful wife more than\r\nmade amends. Nobles and citizens, statesmen, soldiers, and savants\r\nwere alike made welcome; and Louise knew instinctively how to make\r\neach show at his best. With eager interest she discussed\r\nPestalozzi's ideas with his disciples; and when Gotlöeb Hiller, the\r\npoet-son of a miner, was presented to her, she led him aside, and by\r\nthe friendly ease with which she talked of things familiar to him,\r\nspeedily banished his shyness. Indeed, ready as she was to recognize\r\nhigh gifts and to learn from all able to teach, yet it was to the\r\nobscure and suffering that her tones were most soft and gracious.\r\nEven in trifles her thoughtfulness was unfailing. When a count and a\r\nshoemaker were announced at the same moment, she gave audience first\r\nto the shoemaker. \"For time is more valuable to him.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen Louise visiting the Poor.]\r\n\r\nAt Dantzic she constantly wore an amber necklace, because it had\r\nbeen the gift of the townsfolk. The voice which in childhood had\r\npleaded for the panting footman running beside her grandmother's\r\ncoach, might still be heard interceding, for when the royal carriage\r\nwas overturned near Warsaw, and the Oberk of Messterin rated the\r\nservants, Louise interposed: \"We are not hurt, and our people have\r\nassuredly been more alarmed than we.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes the midday meal was spread beneath a forest tree, and from\r\nfar and near the peasants flocked to get \"even a glimpse of her\r\nlovely face.\" They followed in crowds while she and the king climbed\r\nthe Schneekoppe on foot, but loyal shouts died into awed silence\r\nwhen, at the summit, Friedrich Wilhelm bared his head, and the two\r\nstanding side by side gazed at the glorious view. \"That was one of\r\nthe most blessed moments of my life,\" Louise said afterward; \"we\r\nseemed lifted above this earth and nearer our God.\"\r\n\r\nThey entered the mines at Woldenberg by a swift-flowing stream, and\r\ntwenty years afterward the steersman of their boat was fond of\r\ntelling how, in the dark cavern--\"The Foxes' Hole\"--he saw her well\r\nby the torchlight. \"In all my life I never saw such a face. She\r\nlooked grand, as a queen should look, but gentle as a child. She\r\ngave me with her own hands two Holland ducats. My wife wears them\r\nwhen she goes to church, for what she touched is holy.\"\r\n\r\nLouise had never meddled in foreign politics. She had been, she\r\ndesigned to be, only the \"Landesmutter,\" and even when the murder of\r\nthe Duc d'Enghien, seized on Prussian soil, aroused in Berlin a\r\nstorm of indignation, in which she fully shared, she yet sympathized\r\nin the mental distress which found vent in her husband's\r\noften-repeated words, \"I cannot decide for war.\"\r\n\r\nAt last he did decide. In October, 1805, Napoleon ordered Bernadotte\r\nto march his army corps through Anspach. This contemptuous comment\r\non Prussia's ten-years' forbearance was too much for the king's\r\npride. Armies were raised in Franconia, Saxony, Westphalia, and\r\nwhile the excitement was at fever point the czar came to Berlin. All\r\nhis rare charm of manner was brought to bear, and at midnight, in\r\nthe presence of Louise, the two monarchs, standing with clasped\r\nhands beside the tomb of the great Friedrich, solemnly pledged\r\nthemselves to a close alliance.\r\n\r\nAlexander departed to lead his Russians to Moravia, and Friedrich\r\nWilhelm despatched a protest to the French camp; but the envoy,\r\nHaugwitz, arriving on the eve of Austerlitz, waited the issue of the\r\nbattle, and then, withholding his packet, proposed to the victor a\r\nfresh treaty with Prussia. There was wrath in Berlin when his doings\r\nbecame known. The king at first disowned the disgraceful compact,\r\nbut Austerlitz had just taught him what Napoleon's enemies might\r\nexpect. French troops were already massing on his frontier, and in\r\nan evil hour he broke faith with the czar! To Louise, who neither\r\nfeared foe nor deserted friend, that was a bitter time--doubly sad,\r\nindeed, since most of the long winter was spent by the dying bed of\r\nher youngest child. When she lost him her own strength broke down,\r\nand the doctors ordered her away to drink the Pyrmont waters. In the\r\nlate summer she was able to rejoin her husband, and he had startling\r\nnews to tell, for war with France was close at hand.\r\n\r\nSince Haugwitz's fatal agreement Napoleon had heaped injuries on\r\nPrussia. Now, at least, king and people were of one mind. The young\r\nPrussian officers sharpened their swords on the French ambassador's\r\nwindow-sills, patriotic songs were hailed with thunders of applause\r\nin street and theatre, and when the queen, clad in the uniform of\r\nher own Hussars, rode at their head through the city, she was\r\ngreeted with passionate loyalty.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, Friedrich Wilhelm, hitherto too tardy, was now too\r\nprecipitate. He had been passive while France crushed Austria, and\r\nAustria, suspicious and disabled, neither could nor would assist\r\nhim. Russia, with better reason for distrust, responded generously\r\nto his appeal, but he did not wait for her promised aid. For all his\r\nhaste, Napoleon, with 180,000 men, was nearing the Thuringian Forest\r\nbefore the Prussian troops left Berlin. They were very confident,\r\nthose Prussian troops, and the shouting multitudes who watched the\r\nwell-trained artillery and cavalry defiling by, hardly dreamed of\r\ndisaster; yet it came almost at once. The Saxon corps, led by the\r\nking's cousin, Prince Louis, pushing on too fast, was surprised and\r\nsurrounded, and the gallant young commander, the queen's dear\r\nfriend, the idol of the army, fell while rallying his men.\r\n\r\nLouise, who had hurriedly joined the king from Weimar, could hardly\r\nbe persuaded to leave him, but on the evening of October 13th he\r\nconfided her to a cavalry escort, promising speedy tidings of the\r\ncoming battle. As she threaded the lonely passes of the Hartz\r\nMountains she heard the distant cannonading, and a broken sentence\r\nnow and again fell from her lips: \"We know that all things work\r\ntogether for good.\" Late in the misty October twilight she drove\r\ninto Brunswick. At Brandenburg a courier brought the news her\r\ntrembling heart awaited. All was lost! Twenty thousand Prussians lay\r\non the fields of Auerstadt and Jena, and the French were already in\r\nWeimar. The king was alive, but two horses had been killed under\r\nhim. Grief-stricken, travel-worn as she was, Louise must not halt.\r\nBefore she reached Berlin her children had been sent to\r\nSchwedt-on-Oder. She followed thither, almost terrifying them by her\r\nchanged, despairing looks. As soon as she could check her weeping,\r\nshe told her boys all she knew about Prince Louis's death. \"Do not\r\nonly grieve for him. Be ready for Prussia's sake to meet death as he\r\nmet it,\" and then, in burning, never-forgotten words, she bade them\r\none day free their country and break the power of France.\r\n\r\nThere seemed only a choice between utter destruction and utter\r\nsubmission, and yet when Napoleon demanded the cession of almost the\r\nwhole kingdom, Friedrich Wilhelm and his wife agreed that \"only\r\ndetermined resistance can save us.\" She was slowly rallying at\r\nKönigsberg from a fever caught in the crowded city, when the cry was\r\nraised of the coming French. Propped by pillows, swathed in shawls,\r\nshe drove through blinding sleet to Memel, the one fortress still\r\nleft to the king. At her first halting-place the wind whistled in\r\nthrough a broken window, and the melting snow dripped from the roof\r\non to her bed. Her companions trembled for her, but she, calm and\r\ntrustful, hailed as a good omen the sunshine which welcomed them\r\nwithin the walls of Memel.\r\n\r\nA week later Benningsen and his Russians, who had been wading\r\nknee-deep through Polish forests and fording swollen streams, always\r\nwith 90,000 Frenchmen in hot pursuit, turned to bay amid the frozen\r\nlakes and drifted snows of Eylau. Next day those snows for miles\r\naround were red with blood. It was hard to tell with whom the costly\r\nvictory lay, but Napoleon despatched Bertrand to the Russian\r\noutposts to propose an armistice, and Benningsen sent him on to\r\nMemel, reminding the Prussian king that it could not be their\r\ninterest to grant what it was Napoleon's interest to ask. The terms\r\nwere, indeed, far easier than those offered after June; but\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm, true to the ally who had held the field almost\r\nsingle-handed through that terrible winter, would make no separate\r\nagreement, nor did Louise receive more favorably a message to\r\nherself, conveying Napoleon's wish to pay his court to her in her\r\nown capital.\r\n\r\nThough the piercing Baltic winds tried her strength greatly, she\r\nemployed herself whenever able in reading and visiting the over-full\r\nhospitals. To a dear friend she said, \"I can never be perfectly\r\nmiserable while faith in God is open to me.\" \"Only by patient\r\nperseverance,\" so she wrote to her father, \"can we succeed. Sooner\r\nor later I know we shall do so.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not to be yet. On June 14, 1807, Napoleon annihilated the\r\nRussians at Friedland, and four days later Dantzic fell. Her tone\r\ngrew sadder. \"We are not yet bereft of peace. My great sorrow is\r\nbeing unable to hope.\"\r\n\r\nAs the czar could resist no longer and Napoleon desired peace, they\r\nmet at Tilsit, and there, on a covered raft moored midway in the\r\nNiemen, arranged the outlines of a treaty. The next day Friedrich\r\nWilhelm, yielding to stern necessity, accepted terms \"to the last\r\ndegree hard and overwhelming.\" The czar, believing that Louise might\r\nmove even Napoleon to clemency, her husband begged her to join him\r\nat Tilsit. On reading this summons she burst into tears, declaring\r\nthis the hardest task ever given her to do. \"With my broken wing how\r\ncan I succeed?\" she pathetically asked.\r\n\r\nNapoleon paid his respects soon after her arrival, and they met at\r\nthe stairhead. Louise, for Prussia's sake, forced herself to utter\r\ncourteous regrets that he should have to mount so steep a staircase.\r\nHe answered blandly that no difficulties were feared when striving\r\nfor a reward beyond. Then, touching her gauze robe, asked, \"Is it\r\ncrêpe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we speak of such trifles at such a time?\" was her only reply.\r\n\r\nHe was silent; then demanded, \"How could you make war on me?\"\r\n\r\nShe told him that they had overrated their strength.\r\n\r\n\"And relying on the great Friedrich's fame you deceived yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nLouise's clear eyes met his steadily. \"Sire, resting on the great\r\nFriedrich's fame, we might naturally deceive ourselves, if, indeed,\r\nwe wholly did so.\"\r\n\r\nThen she told him that she had come to entreat him to be generous to\r\nPrussia. He answered respectfully, but made no promise. Again, with\r\nexceeding earnestness, she implored at least for Magdeburg, just\r\nthen Friedrich Wilhelm entered, and Napoleon abruptly took leave.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said Talleyrand warningly to him, when they were alone,\r\n\"shall posterity say that you threw away your great conquest for the\r\nsake of a lovely woman?\"\r\n\r\nLouise meanwhile dwelt again and again on Napoleon's words, \"You ask\r\na great deal, but I will think about it.\" Yet her heart was heavy,\r\nand when arrayed for the evening banquet in the splendid attire so\r\nlong unworn, she likened herself sadly to the old German victims\r\ndecked for sacrifice. Napoleon said of her afterward, \"I knew I\r\nshould see a beautiful and dignified queen; I found the most\r\ninteresting woman and admirable queen I had ever known.\"\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Tilsit restored to Friedrich Wilhelm a fragment of his\r\nkingdom, but even this was to be held by the French till after the\r\npayment of a huge indemnity. Napoleon's threat that he would make\r\nthe Prussian nobles beg their bread had hardly been a vain one, for\r\nthe unhappy Prussians had to feed, lodge, and clothe every French\r\nsoldier quartered in their land. Dark as was the outlook, Louise was\r\nupheld by loving pride in her husband. \"After Eylau he might have\r\ndeserted a faithful ally. This he would not do. I believe his\r\nconduct will yet bring good fortune to Prussia.\"\r\n\r\nTo help forward that good fortune they sold most of the crown lands\r\nand the queen's jewels, and had the gold plate melted down. Amid\r\ntheir heavy anxieties and pains they were not wholly unhappy, these\r\ntwo, who loved each other so entirely. \"My Louise,\" the king said to\r\nher one day, \"you have grown yet dearer to me in this time of\r\ntrouble, for I more fully know the treasure I possess.\"\r\n\r\nShe, too, could write of him, \"The king is kinder to me than ever, a\r\ngreat joy and reward after a union of fourteen years.\" Still those\r\nabout her told of sleepless nights when prayer was her only relief.\r\nHer eyes had lost their brightness, her cheeks were pale, her step\r\nlanguid. By the Christmas of 1808 the last French soldier had\r\nquitted Prussian soil; but it was not deemed safe for the royal\r\nfamily to return at once to Berlin, and they spent the summer at\r\nHufen, near Königsberg. Parents and children were constantly\r\ntogether, and the mother taught herself to believe that the sharp\r\ntrials of those years would tell for good on her boys and girls. \"If\r\nthey had been reared in luxury and prosperity they might think that\r\nso it must always be.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till the end of 1809 that the exiles turned their faces\r\nhomeward. They travelled slowly, for the queen was still feeble.\r\nEverywhere a glad welcome greeted them; and on December 23d, the day\r\non which, sixteen years before, she had entered the capital a\r\ngirl-bride, Louise drove through its familiar streets in a carriage\r\npresented to her by the rejoicing citizens. Her father was waiting\r\nat the palace gate. He helped her to alight and led her in. Three\r\nyears had gone by since she last crossed the threshold of her home,\r\nand what years they had been! Nor was the return all joy, for she\r\nknew and dreaded the changes she would find there. Napoleon and his\r\ngenerals had not departed empty handed. They had stripped the rooms\r\nof paintings and statues, of manuscripts and antiquities.\r\n\r\nAs the doors closed a great shout arose from the vast crowd before\r\nthe palace. Presently she appeared in the balcony, and all saw the\r\ntraces of long anguish in the lovely face, now bright with grateful\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\nAfter a solemn service in the Dom, the king and queen drove through\r\nthe illuminated city to the opera-house. \"The queen sat beside her\r\nhusband\"--so wrote Fouqué afterward--\"and as she talked she often\r\nraised her eyes to him with a very touching expression.... Our\r\nbeloved queen has thanked us with tears. Bonaparte has dimmed those\r\nheavenly eyes ... and we must do all we can to make them sparkle\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe bare walls, the empty cabinets of the palace, accorded with the\r\nalmost ascetic habits now maintained there. Self-denial was made\r\neasy by one belief, that Prussia would arise from her great\r\nsuffering stronger than before. The king and queen were not left to\r\nwork alone toward that high end. Able generals replaced those who,\r\nthrough treachery or faint-heartedness, had surrendered the\r\nfortresses. Stein, now chief minister, curtailed the rights of the\r\nnobles, and gave the serfs an interest in guarding the soil they\r\ntilled; while Scharnhorst, by an ingenious evasion of Napoleon's\r\nedict limiting the Prussian army, contrived to have 200,000 men\r\nrapidly drilled and trained. The universities founded at Berlin and\r\nBreslau became the head-quarters of secret societies for the\r\ndeliverance of the Fatherland. Princes and professors, merchants\r\nruined by the Berlin decrees, and peasants ground down by French\r\nexactions, joined the Jugendbund, and implicitly obeyed the orders\r\nof its unseen heads. Through town and country spread that vast\r\nbrotherhood, fired by the songs of Tieck and Arnim to live or die\r\nfor Prussia.\r\n\r\nAnd Louise watched thankfully the dawning promise of better days,\r\n\"though, alas! we may die before they come.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps that sad presentiment haunted her husband too. If she jested\r\nwith her children he would say wistfully, \"The queen is quite\r\nherself to-day. What a blessing it will be if her mind recovers its\r\njoyous tone!\"\r\n\r\nThat spring Louise was attacked by spasms of the heart. They did not\r\nlast long, and when the court moved to Potsdam she seemed to regain\r\nstrength, and showed much interest in discussing with Bishop Eylert\r\nhow best to train her boys so that they might serve their country.\r\nThough very weak, she accompanied her family to Hohengieritz, the\r\nking perforce returning to Berlin. The loving eyes that watched her\r\nsaw signs of amendment, but early on Monday, July 16th, the spasms\r\nrecurred. For hours no remedies availed. She could only gasp for\r\n\"Air! air!\" and when the sharp pain had passed lay exhausted, now\r\nmurmuring a few words of some hymn learnt as a child, faintly\r\nthanking God for each solace sent her, or entreating her grandmother\r\nto rest. No complaint passed her lips; she was only \"very, very\r\nweary.\"\r\n\r\nThey told her that couriers had been despatched for the king, and\r\nshe asked anxiously, \"Will he soon come?\" Before dawn he came,\r\nbringing the two elder boys. For those who tried to cheer him he had\r\nonly one mournful reply: \"If she were not mine she might recover.\" A\r\ngleam of joy lighted her pale face when he came to her bedside, but\r\nperceiving his emotion she asked, \"Am I then so very ill?\" Unable to\r\nreply, he hurriedly left the room, and she said to those standing\r\nby, \"His embrace was so wild, so fervent, that it seemed as though\r\nhe would take leave of me. Tell him not to do that, or I shall die\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned bringing in the children.\r\n\r\n\"My Fritz! my Wilhelm!\" She had only time for one long gaze, and\r\nthen the agonizing pain came again. One of the doctors tried to\r\nraise her, but she sank back. \"Only death can help me;\" and as all\r\nwatched in breathless silence, she leaned her head against the\r\nshoulder of a faithful attendant, murmured, \"Lord Jesus, shorten\r\nit!\" and with one deep-drawn breath passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES WATT\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TIMES, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n(1736-1819)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Watt.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Watt was born at Greenock, January 19, 1736. He was the fourth\r\nchild in a family which, for a hundred years, had more or less\r\nprofessed mathematics and navigation. His constitution was delicate,\r\nand his mental powers were precocious. He was distinguished from an\r\nearly age by his candor and truthfulness; and his father, to\r\nascertain the cause of any of his boyish quarrels, used to say, \"Let\r\nJames speak; from him I always hear the truth.\" James also showed\r\nhis constructive tastes equally early, experimenting on his\r\nplaythings with a set of small carpenter's tools, which his father\r\nhad given him. At six he was still at home. \"Mr. Watt,\" said a\r\nfriend to the father, \"you ought to send that boy to school, and not\r\nlet him trifle away his time at home.\" \"Look what he is doing before\r\nyou condemn him,\" was the reply. The visitor then observed the child\r\nhad drawn mathematical lines and figures on the hearth, and was\r\nengaged in a process of calculation. On putting questions to him, he\r\nwas astonished at his quickness and simplicity. \"Forgive me,\" said\r\nhe, \"this child's education has not been neglected; this is no\r\ncommon child.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Watt discovering the Condensation of Steam.]\r\n\r\nWatt's cousin, Mrs. Marian Campbell, describes his inventive capacity\r\nas a story-teller, and details an incident of his occupying himself\r\nwith the steam of a tea-kettle, and by means of a cup and a spoon\r\nmaking an early experiment in the condensation of steam. To this\r\nincident she probably attached more importance than was its due, from\r\nreverting to it when illustrated by her after-recollections. Out of\r\nthis story, reliable or not in the sense ascribed to it, M. Arago\r\nobtained an oratorical point for an _éloge_, which he delivered to the\r\nFrench Institute. Watt may or may not have been occupied as a boy with\r\nthe study of the condensation of steam while he was playing with the\r\nkettle. The story suggests a possibility, nothing more; though it has\r\nbeen made the foundation of a grave announcement, the subject of a\r\npretty picture, and will ever remain a basis for suggestive\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nWatt was sent to a commercial school, where he was provided with a\r\nfair outfit of Latin and with some elements of Greek; but\r\nmathematics he studied with greater zest, and with proportionate\r\nsuccess. By the time he was fifteen, he had read twice, with grave\r\nattention, Gravesande's \"Elements of Natural Philosophy;\" and \"while\r\nunder his father's roof he went on with various chemical\r\nexperiments, repeating them again and again, until satisfied of\r\ntheir accuracy from his own observations.\" He even made himself a\r\nsmall electrical machine, about 1750-53; no mean performance at that\r\ndate, since, according to Priestley's \"History of Electricity,\" the\r\nLeyden phial itself was not invented until the years 1745-46.\r\n\r\nHis pastime lay chiefly in his father's marine store, among the\r\nsails and ropes, the blocks and tackle: or by the old gray gateway\r\nof the Mansion House on the hill above Greenock, where he would\r\nloiter away hours by day, and at night lie down on his back and\r\nwatch the stars through the trees.\r\n\r\nAt this early age Watt suffered from continual and violent\r\nheadaches, which often affected his nervous system for many days,\r\neven weeks; and he was similarly afflicted throughout his long life.\r\nHe seldom rose early, but accomplished more in a few hours' study\r\nthan ordinary minds do in many days. He was never in a hurry, and\r\nalways had leisure to give to his friends, to poetry, romance, and\r\nthe publications of the day; he read indiscriminately almost every\r\nnew book he could procure. He assisted his father in his business,\r\nand soon learned to construct with his own hands several of the\r\narticles required in the way of his parent's trade; and by means of\r\na small forge, set up for his own use, he repaired and made various\r\nkinds of instruments, and converted, by the way, a large silver coin\r\ninto a punch-ladle, as a trophy of his early skill as a metal-smith.\r\nFrom this aptitude for ingenious handiwork, and in accordance with\r\nhis own deliberate choice, it was decided that he should proceed to\r\nqualify himself for following the trade of a mathematical instrument\r\nmaker. He accordingly went to Glasgow, in June, 1754, and from\r\nthere, after a year's stay, he proceeded for better instruction to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nOn Watt's arrival in the metropolis, he sought a situation, but in\r\nvain, and he was beginning to despond, when he obtained work with\r\none John Morgan, an instrument-maker, in Finch Lane, Cornhill. Here\r\nhe gradually became proficient in making quadrants, parallel rulers,\r\ncompasses, theodolites, etc., until, at the end of a year's\r\npractice, he could make \"a brass sector with a French joint, which\r\nis reckoned as nice a piece of framing work as is in the trade.\"\r\nDuring this interval he contrived to live upon eight shillings a\r\nweek, exclusive of his lodging. His fear of the press-gang and his\r\nbodily ailments, however, led to his quitting London in August,\r\n1756, and returning to Scotland, after investing twenty guineas in\r\nadditional tools.\r\n\r\nAt Glasgow, through the intervention of Dr. Dick, he was first\r\nemployed in cleaning and repairing some of the instruments belonging\r\nto the college; and, after some difficulty, he received permission\r\nto open a shop within the precincts as \"mathematical instrument\r\nmaker to the University.\" Here Watt prospered, pursuing alike his\r\ncourse of manual labor and of mental study, and especially extending\r\nhis acquaintance with physics; endeavoring, as he said, \"to find out\r\nthe weak side of nature, and to vanquish her.\" About this time he\r\ncontrived an ingenious machine for drawing in perspective; and from\r\nfifty to eighty of these instruments, manufactured by him, were sent\r\nto different parts of the world. He had now procured the friendship\r\nof Dr. Black and another University worthy, John Robison, who, in\r\nstating the circumstances of his first introduction to Watt, says:\r\n\"I saw a workman, and expected no more; but was surprised to find a\r\nphilosopher as young as myself, and always ready to instruct me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some time in 1764 that the professor of natural philosophy in\r\nthe University desired Watt to repair a pretty model of Newcomen's\r\nsteam-engine. Like everything which came into Watt's hands, it soon\r\nbecame an object of most serious study.\r\n\r\nThe interesting little model, as altered by the hand of Watt, was\r\nlong placed beside the noble statue of the engineer in the Hunterian\r\nMuseum at Glasgow. Watt himself, when he had got the bearings of his\r\ninvention, could think of nothing else but his machine, and\r\naddressed himself to Dr. Roebuck, of the Carron Iron-works, with the\r\nview of its practical introduction to the world. A partnership\r\nensued, but the connection did not prove satisfactory. Watt went on\r\nwith his experiments, and in September, 1766, wrote to a friend: \"I\r\nthink I have laid up a stock of experience that will _soon_ pay me\r\nfor the trouble it has cost me.\" Yet it was between eight and nine\r\nyears before that invaluable experience was made available, so as\r\neither to benefit the public or repay the inventor; and a much\r\nlonger term elapsed before it was possible for that repayment to be\r\nreckoned in the form of substantial profit.\r\n\r\nWatt now began to practise as a land-surveyor and civil engineer.\r\nHis first engineering work was a survey for a canal to unite the\r\nForth and Clyde, in furtherance of which he had to appear before the\r\nHouse of Commons. His consequent journey to London was still more\r\nimportant, for then it was that he saw for the first time the great\r\nmanufactory which Boulton had established at Soho, and of which he\r\nwas afterward himself to be the guiding intelligence. In the\r\nmeantime, among his other performances, he invented a micrometer for\r\nmeasuring distances; and, what is still more remarkable, he\r\nentertained the idea of moving canal-boats by the steam-engine\r\nthrough the instrumentality of a _spiral oar_, which as nearly as\r\npossible coincides with the screw-propeller of our day.\r\n\r\nWatt's negotiations for partnership with Boulton were long and\r\ntedious. Dr. Roebuck's creditors concurred because, curiously\r\nenough, _none of them valued Watt's engine at a farthing_. Watt\r\nhimself now began to despair, and his health failed; yet in 1774,\r\nwhen he had removed to Birmingham, he wrote to his father: \"The\r\nfire-engine I have invented is now going, and answers much better\r\nthan any other that has yet been made; and I expect that the\r\ninvention will be very beneficial to me.\"\r\n\r\nA long series of experimental trials was, nevertheless, requisite\r\nbefore the engine could be brought to such perfection as to render\r\nit generally available to the public, and therefore profitable to\r\nits manufacturers. In January, 1775, six years of the patent had\r\nelapsed, and there seemed some probability of the remaining eight\r\nrunning out as fruitlessly. An application which was made for the\r\nextension of its term was unexpectedly opposed by the eloquence of\r\nBurke; but the orator and his associates failed, and the extension\r\nwas accorded by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe first practical employment of Watt's engines to any considerable\r\nextent was in the mining districts of Cornwall, where he himself\r\nwas, in consequence, compelled to spend much of his time subsequent\r\nto 1775. Here he had to contend not only with natural obstacles in\r\nthe dark abysses of deeply flooded mines, but with a rude and\r\nobstinate class of men as deeply flooded by inveterate prejudices.\r\nThe result in the way of profit was not, however, satisfactory,\r\nnotwithstanding the service to the mining interest was enormous. \"It\r\nappears,\" says Watt, in 1780, \"by our books, that Cornwall has\r\nhitherto eat up all the profits we have drawn from it, and all we\r\nhave got by other places, and a good sum of our own money to the\r\nbargain.\"\r\n\r\nAt this stage Watt himself was more fertile in mechanical inventions\r\nthan in any other portion of his busy life. Taking his patents in\r\ntheir chronological order, the first (subsequent to that of 1769)\r\nwas \"For a new method of copying letters and other writings\r\nexpeditiously,\" by means of copying _presses_. Of the same date was\r\nhis invention of a machine \"for drying linen and muslin by steam.\"\r\nOn October 25, 1781, he took out his third patent (the second of the\r\nsteam-engine series), \"for certain new methods of applying the\r\nvibrating or reciprocating motion of steam or fire engines, to\r\nproduce a continued rotative motion round an axis or centre, and\r\nthereby to give motion to the wheels of mills or other machines.\"\r\nOne of these methods was that commonly known as the _sun-and-planet\r\nwheels_; they were five in all. A favorite employment of his in the\r\nworkshops at Soho, in the later months of 1783 and earlier ones of\r\n1784, was to teach his steam-engine, now become nearly as docile as\r\nit was powerful, to work a tilt-hammer for forging iron and making\r\nsteel. \"Three hundred blows per minute--a thing never done before,\"\r\nfilled him, as his biographer says, with feelings of excusable\r\npride. Another patent in the steam-engine series, taken out in 1784,\r\ncontained, besides other methods of converting a circular or angular\r\nmotion into a perpendicular or rectilineal motion, the well-known\r\nand much-admired _parallel motion_, and the application of the\r\nsteam-engine to give motion to wheel-carriages for carrying persons\r\nand goods. To ascertain the exact number of strokes made by an\r\nengine during a given time, and thereby to check the cheats of the\r\nCornish miners, Watt also invented the \"Counter,\" with its several\r\nindexes. Among his leading improvements, introduced at various\r\nperiods, were the _throttle-valve_, the application of the\r\n_governor_, the _barometer_ or float, the _steam-gauge_, and the\r\nindicator. The term during which he seems to have thus combined the\r\ngreatest maturity with the greatest activity of intellect, and the\r\nportion of his life which they comprehended, was from his fortieth\r\nto his fiftieth year. Yet it was a term of increased suffering from\r\nhis acute sick-headaches, and remarkable for the infirmities over\r\nwhich he triumphed; notwithstanding, he himself complained of his\r\n\"stupidity and want of the inventive faculty.\"\r\n\r\nWatt's chemical studies in 1783, and the calculations they involved\r\nfrom experiments made by foreign chemists, induced him to make a\r\nproposal for a philosophical _uniformity of weights and measures_;\r\nand he discussed this proposal with Priestley and Magellan. While\r\nWatt was examining the constituent parts of water, he had\r\nopportunities of familiar intercourse not only with Priestley, but\r\nwith Withering, Keir, Edgeworth, Galton, Darwin, and his own\r\npartner, Boulton--all men above the average for their common\r\ninterest in scientific inquiries. Dr. Parr frequently attended their\r\nmeetings, and they kept up a correspondence with Sir William\r\nHerschel, Sir Joseph Banks, Dr. Solander, and Afzelius. Mrs.\r\nSchimmelpenninck, who was greatly given to physiognomical studies,\r\nhas left us this picture of Watt at this period.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Boulton was a man to rule society with dignity; Mr. Watt, to\r\nlead the contemplative life of a deeply introverted and patiently\r\nobservant philosopher. He was one of the most complete specimens of\r\nthe melancholic temperament. His head was generally bent forward, or\r\nleaning on his hand in meditation; his shoulders stooping, and his\r\nchest falling in; his limbs lank and unmuscular, and his complexion\r\nsallow. His intellectual development was magnificent; comparison and\r\ncausality immense, with large ideality and constructiveness,\r\nindividuality, an enormous concentrativeness and caution.\r\n\r\n\"He had a broad Scottish accent; gentle, modest, and unassuming\r\nmanners; yet, when he entered a room, men of letters, men of\r\nscience, nay, military men, artists, ladies, even little children,\r\nthronged round him. Ladies would appeal to him on the best means of\r\ndevising grates, curing smoky chimneys, warming their houses, and\r\nobtaining fast colors. I can speak from experience of his teaching\r\nme how to make a dulcimer and improve a Jew's harp.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1786, Watt and Boulton visited Paris, on the invitation\r\nof the French Government, to superintend the erection of certain\r\nsteam-engines, and especially to suggest improvements in the great\r\nhydraulic machine of Marly, which Watt himself designates a\r\n\"venerable\" work. In Paris Watt made many acquaintances, including\r\nLavoisier, Laplace, Fourcroy, and others scarcely less eminent; and\r\nwhile here he discussed with Berthollet a new method of _bleaching_\r\nby chlorides, an invention of the latter which Watt subsequently\r\nintroduced into England.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Watt had vigilantly to defend his patents at home, which\r\nwere assailed by unworthy and surreptitious rivals as soon as it was\r\nproved that they were pecuniarily valuable. Some of the competing\r\nengines, as Watt himself described them, were simply asthmatic.\r\n\"Hornblower's, at Radstock, was obliged to stand still once every\r\nten minutes to snore and snort.\" \"Some were like Evan's mill, _which\r\nwas a gentlemanly mill_; it would go when it had nothing to do, but\r\nit refused to work.\" The legal proceedings, both in equity and at\r\ncommon law, which now became necessary, were numerous. One bill of\r\ncosts, from 1796 to 1800, amounted to between £5,000 and £6,000; and\r\nthe mental and bodily labor, the anxiety and vexation, which were\r\nsuperadded, involved a fearful tax on the province of Watt's\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1800 came the expiration of the privilege of the\r\npatent of 1769, as extended by the statute of 1775; and also the\r\ndissolution of the original copartnership of Messrs. Boulton and\r\nWatt, then of five-and-twenty years' duration. The contract was\r\nrenewed by their sons, the business having become so profitable that\r\nWatt and his children were provided with a source of independent\r\nincome; and at the age of sixty-four the great inventor had\r\npersonally realized some of the benefits he contemplated.\r\n\r\nHenceforth Watt's ingenuity became excursive, discretionary, almost\r\ncapricious; but in every phase and form it continued to be\r\nbeneficent. In 1808 he founded a prize in Glasgow College, as an\r\nacknowledgment of \"the many favors that learned body had conferred\r\nupon him.\" In 1816 he made a donation to the town of Greenock, \"to\r\nform the beginning of a scientific library\" for the instruction of\r\nits young men. Nor, amid such donations, were others wanting on his\r\npart, such as true religion prescribes, to console the poor and\r\nrelieve the suffering.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, on a visit to Greenock, Watt made a voyage in a steamboat\r\nto Rothsay and back again. In the course of this experimental trip\r\nhe pointed out to the engineer of the boat the method of \"backing\"\r\nthe engine. With a foot-rule he demonstrated to him what he meant.\r\nNot succeeding, however, he at last, under the impulse of the ruling\r\npassion (and we must remember he was then eighty), threw off his\r\novercoat, and putting his hand to the engine himself, showed the\r\npractical application of his lecture. Previously to this, the\r\n\"backstroke\" of the steamboat engine was either unknown or not\r\ngenerally known. The practice was to stop the engine entirely a\r\nconsiderable time before the vessel reached the point of mooring, in\r\norder to allow for the gradual and natural diminution of her speed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the application of steam power to _locomotion on\r\nland_, it is remarkable enough that, when Watt's attention was first\r\ndirected, by his friend Robison, to the steam-engine, \"he (Robison)\r\nat that time drew out an idea of applying the power to the moving of\r\nwheel-carriages.\" \"But the scheme,\" adds Watt, \"was not matured, and\r\nwas soon abandoned on his going abroad.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1769, however, when he heard that a linen-draper, one Moore, had\r\ntaken out a patent for moving wheel-carriages by steam, he replied:\r\n\"If linen-draper Moore does not use my engine to drive his chaises,\r\nhe can't drive them by steam.\" In the specification of his patent of\r\n1784, he even described the principles and construction of\r\n\"steam-engines which are applied to give motion to wheel-carriages\r\nfor removing persons or goods, or other matters, from place to\r\nplace,\" and in 1786, Watt himself had a steam-carriage \"of some size\r\nunder hand;\" but his most developed plan was to move such carriages\r\n\"on a hard smooth plane,\" and there is no evidence to show that he\r\never anticipated the union of the rail and wheel.\r\n\r\nAmong Watt's mechanical recreations, soon after the date of the last\r\nof his steam-engine patents, were four plans of making lamps, which\r\nhe describes in a letter to Argand; and for a long time lamps were\r\nmade at Soho upon his principles, which gave a light surpassing,\r\nboth in steadiness and brilliancy, anything of the kind that had\r\nappeared. About a year after, in 1788, he made \"a pretty instrument\r\nfor determining the specific gravities of liquids,\" having, he says\r\nto Dr. Black, improved on a hint he had taken.\r\n\r\nWatt also turned his \"idle thoughts\" toward the construction of an\r\n_arithmetical machine_, but he does not appear ever to have\r\nprosecuted this design further than by mentally considering the\r\nmanner in which he could make it perform the processes of\r\nmultiplication and division.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present century Watt devised, for the Glasgow\r\nwater-works, to bring pure spring-water across the Clyde, an\r\narticulated suction-pipe, with joints formed on the principle of\r\nthose in a lobster's tail, and so made capable of accommodating\r\nitself to all the actual and possible bendings at the bottom of the\r\nriver. This pipe was, moreover, executed at Soho from his plans, and\r\nwas found to succeed perfectly.\r\n\r\nWatt describes, as his hobby, a _machine to copy sculpture_,\r\nsuggested to him by an implement he had seen and admired in Paris in\r\n1802, where it was used for tracing and multiplying the dies of\r\nmedals. He foresaw the possibility of enlarging its powers so as to\r\nmake it capable of working even on wood and marble, to do for solid\r\nmasses and in hard materials what his copying machine of 1782 had\r\nalready done for drawings and writings impressed upon flat surfaces\r\nof paper--to produce, in fact, a perfect fac-simile of the original\r\nmodel. He worked at this machine most assiduously, and his \"likeness\r\nlathe,\" as he termed it, was set up in a garret, which, with all its\r\nmysterious contents, its tools, and models included, have been\r\ncarefully preserved as he left them.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to find that the charm of Watt's presence was not\r\ndimmed by age. \"His friends,\" says Lord Jeffrey, speaking of a visit\r\nwhich he paid to Scotland when upward of eighty, \"in that part of\r\nthe country never saw him more full of intellectual vigor and\r\ncolloquial animation, never more delightful or more instructive.\" It\r\nwas then also that Sir Walter Scott, meeting him \"surrounded by a\r\nlittle band of northern literati,\" saw and heard what he felt he was\r\nnever to see or hear again--\"the alert, kind, benevolent old man,\r\nhis talents and fancy overflowing on every subject, with his\r\nattention alive to everyone's question his information at everyone's\r\ncommand.\" Campbell, the poet, who saw him later, in the beginning\r\nof 1819 (he was then eighty-three), describes him as so full of\r\nanecdote, that he spent one of the most amusing days he had ever had\r\nwith him. Lord Brougham, later still, in the summer of the same\r\nyear, found his instructive conversation and his lively and even\r\nplayful manner unchanged. But in the autumn of this year, on August\r\n19th, he expired tranquilly at his house at Heathfield. He was\r\nburied at Handsworth. A tribute to his memory was but tardily\r\nrendered by the nation.\r\n\r\nJeffrey and Arago added more elaborate tributes to Watt's genius;\r\nand Wordsworth has declared that he looked upon him, considering his\r\nmagnitude and universality, \"as perhaps the most extraordinary man\r\nthat this country has ever produced.\" His noblest monument is,\r\nhowever, his own work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. EDWARD JENNER\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TIMBS, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n(1749-1823)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. Edward Jenner.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFew of the many thousand ills which human flesh is heir to, have\r\nspread such devastation among the family of man as small-pox. Its\r\nuniversality has ranged from the untold tribes of savages to the\r\nsilken baron of civilization; and its ravages on life and beauty\r\nhave been shown in many a sad tale of domestic suffering. To stay\r\nthe destroying hand of such a scourge, which by some has been\r\nidentified with the Plague of Athens, was reserved for Edward\r\nJenner, the discoverer of vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe great fact can, however, be traced half a century before\r\nJenner's time. In the journal of John Byron, F.R.S., under date June\r\n3, 1725, it is recorded that: \"At a meeting of the Royal Society,\r\nSir Isaac Newton presiding, Dr. Jurin read a case of small-pox,\r\nwhere a girl who had been inoculated and had been vaccinated, was\r\ntried and had them not again; but another [a] boy, caught the\r\nsmall-pox from this girl, and had the confluent kind and died.\"\r\n\r\nThis case occurred at Hanover. The inoculation of the girl seems to\r\nhave failed entirely; it was suspected that she had not taken the true\r\nsmall-pox; doubts, however, were removed, as a boy, who daily saw the\r\ngirl, fell ill and died, \"having had a very bad small-pox of the\r\nconfluent sort.\" This is the first use of the word _vaccination_, or,\r\nmore familiarly, cow-pox, which is an eruption arising from the\r\ninsertion into the system of matter obtained from the eruption on the\r\nteats and udders of cows, and especially in Gloucestershire; it is\r\nalso frequently denominated _vaccine matter_; and the whole affair,\r\ninoculation and its consequences, is called vaccination, from the\r\nLatin _vacca_, a cow.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that Jenner's merit lay in the scientific application\r\nof his knowledge of the fact that the chapped hands of milkers of cows\r\nsometimes proved a preventive of small-pox, and from those of them\r\nwhom he endeavored to inoculate resisting the infection. These results\r\nwere probably known far beyond Jenner's range, and long before his\r\ntime; for we have respectable testimony of their having come within\r\nthe observation of a Cheshire gentleman, who had been informed of them\r\nshortly after settling on his estate in Prestbury parish, in or about\r\n1740. This does not in the least detract from Jenner's merit, but\r\nshows that to his genius for observation, analogy, and experiment, we\r\nare indebted for this application of a simple fact, only incidentally\r\nremarked by others, but by Jenner rendered the stepping-stone to his\r\ngreat discovery--or, in other words, extending its benefits from a\r\nsingle parish in Gloucestershire to the whole world.\r\n\r\nWe agree with a contemporary, that, \"among all the names which ought\r\nto be consecrated by the gratitude of mankind, that of Jenner stands\r\npre-eminent. It would be difficult, we are inclined to say\r\nimpossible, to select from the catalogue of benefactors to human\r\nnature an individual who has contributed so largely to the\r\npreservation of life, and to the alleviation of suffering. Into\r\nwhatever corner of the world the blessing of printed knowledge has\r\npenetrated, there also will the name of Jenner be familiar; but the\r\nfruits of his discovery have ripened in barbarous soils, where books\r\nhave never been opened, and where the savage does not pause to\r\ninquire from what source he has derived relief. No improvement in\r\nthe physical sciences can bear a parallel with that which ministers\r\nin every part of the globe to the prevention of deformity, and, in a\r\ngreat proportion, to the exemption from actual destruction.\"\r\n\r\nThe ravages which the small-pox formerly committed are scarcely\r\nconceived or recollected by the present generation. An instance of\r\ndeath occurring after vaccination is now eagerly seized and\r\ncommented upon; yet seventy years have not elapsed since this\r\ndisease might fairly be termed the scourge of mankind, and an enemy\r\nmore extensive and more insidious than even the plague. A family\r\nblighted in its fairest hopes through this terrible visitation was\r\nan every-day spectacle: the imperial House of Austria lost eleven of\r\nits offspring in fifty years. This instance is mentioned because it\r\nis historical; but in the obscure and unrecorded scenes of life this\r\npest was often a still more merciless intruder.\r\n\r\nEdward Jenner was the third son of the Vicar of Berkeley, in\r\nGloucestershire, where he was born, May 17, 1749. Before he was nine\r\nyears of age he showed a growing taste for natural history, in\r\nforming a collection of the nests of the dormouse; and when at\r\nschool at Cirencester he was fond of searching for fossils, which\r\nabound in that neighborhood. He was articled to a surgeon at\r\nSudbury, near Bristol, and at the end of his apprenticeship came to\r\nLondon, and studied under John Hunter, with whom he resided as a\r\npupil for two years and formed a lasting friendship with that great\r\nman. In 1773 he returned to his native village, and commenced\r\npractice as a surgeon and apothecary, with great success.\r\nNevertheless, he abstracted from the fatigues of country practice\r\nsufficient time to form a museum of specimens of comparative anatomy\r\nand natural history. He was much liked, was a man of lively and\r\nsimple humor, and loved to tell his observation of nature in homely\r\nverse; and in 1788 he communicated to the Royal Society his curious\r\npaper on the cuckoo. At the same time he carried to London a drawing\r\nof the casual disease, as seen on the hands of the milkers, and\r\nshowed it to Sir Everard Home and to others. John Hunter had alluded\r\nfrequently to the fact in his lectures; Dr. Adams had heard of the\r\ncow-pox both from Hunter and Clive, and mentions it in his \"Treatise\r\non Poisons,\" published in 1795, three years previous to Jenner's own\r\npublication. Still, no one had the courage or the penetration to\r\nprosecute the inquiry except Jenner.\r\n\r\nJenner now resolved to confine his practice to medicine, and\r\nobtained, in 1792, a degree of M.D. from the University of St.\r\nAndrew's.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the great event of Jenner's life. While pursuing\r\nhis professional education in the house of his master at Sudbury, a\r\nyoung countrywoman applied for advice; and the subject of small-pox\r\nbeing casually mentioned, she remarked she could not take the\r\nsmall-pox because she had had cow-pox; and he then learnt that it\r\nwas a popular notion in that district, that milkers who had been\r\ninfected with a peculiar eruption which sometimes occurred on the\r\nudder of the cow, were completely secure against the small-pox. The\r\nmedical gentlemen of the district told Jenner that the security\r\nwhich it gave was not perfect; and Sir George Baker, the physician,\r\ntreated it as a popular error. But Jenner thought otherwise; and\r\nalthough John Hunter and other eminent surgeons disregarded the\r\nsubject, Jenner pursued it. He found at Berkeley that some persons,\r\nto whom it was impossible to give small-pox by inoculation, had had\r\ncow-pox; but that others who had had cow-pox yet received small-pox.\r\nThis led to the doctor's discovery that the cow was subject to a\r\ncertain eruption, which had the power of guarding from small-pox;\r\nand next, that it might be possible to propagate the cow-pox, and\r\nwith it security from the small-pox, first from the cow to the human\r\nbody, and thence from one person to another. Here, then, was an\r\nimportant discovery, that matter from the cow, intentionally\r\ninserted into the body, gave a slighter ailment than when received\r\notherwise, and yet had the same effect of completely preventing\r\nsmall-pox. But of what advantage was it for mankind that the cows of\r\nGloucestershire possessed a matter thus singularly powerful? How\r\nwere persons living at a distance to derive benefit from this great\r\ndiscovery? Dr. Jenner, having inoculated several persons from a cow,\r\ntook the matter from the human vesicles thus produced, and\r\ninoculated others, and others from them again; thus making it pass\r\nin succession through many individuals, and all with the same good\r\neffect in preventing small-pox.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity occurred of making a trial of the latter on May 14,\r\n1796 (a day still commemorated by the annual festival at Berlin),\r\nwhen a boy, aged eight years, was vaccinated with matter from the\r\nhands of a milkmaid; the experiment succeeded, and he was inoculated\r\nfor small-pox on July 1st following without the least effect. Dr.\r\nJenner then extended his experiments, and in 1798 published his\r\nfirst memoir on the subject. He had originally intended to\r\ncommunicate his results to the Royal Society, but was admonished not\r\nto do so, lest it should injure the character which he had\r\npreviously acquired among scientific persons by his paper on the\r\nnatural history of the cuckoo. In the above work Dr. Jenner\r\nannounces the security against small-pox afforded by the true\r\ncow-pox, and also traces the origin of that disease in the cow to a\r\nsimilar affection of the heel of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe method, however, met with much opposition, until, in the\r\nfollowing year, thirty-three leading physicians and forty eminent\r\nsurgeons of London signed an earnest expression of their confidence\r\nin the efficacy of the cow-pox. The royal family of England exerted\r\nthemselves to encourage Jenner; the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of\r\nYork, the king, the Prince of Wales, and the queen bestowed great\r\nattention upon Jenner. The incalculable utility of cow-pox was at\r\nlast evinced; and observation and experience furnished evidence\r\nenough to satisfy the Baillies and Heberdens, the Monros and\r\nGregorys of Britain, as well as the physicians of Europe, India, and\r\nAmerica. The new practice now began to supersede the old plan\r\npursued by the Small-pox Hospital, which had been founded for\r\ninoculation. The two systems were each pursued until 1808, when the\r\nhospital governors discontinued small-pox inoculation.\r\n\r\nA committee of Parliament was now appointed to consider the claims\r\nof Jenner upon the gratitude of his country. It was clearly proved\r\nthat he had converted into scientific demonstration a tradition of\r\nthe peasantry. Two parliamentary grants, of £10,000 and £20,000,\r\nwere voted to him. In 1808 the National Vaccine Establishment was\r\nformed by Government, and placed under his direction. Honors were\r\nprofusely showered upon him by various foreign princes, as well as\r\nby the principal learned bodies of Europe.\r\n\r\nDr. Jenner passed the remainder of his years principally at Berkeley\r\nand at Cheltenham, continuing to the last, his inquiries on the\r\ngreat object of his life. He died at Berkeley, in February, 1823, at\r\nthe green old age of seventy-four: his remains lie in the chancel of\r\nthe parish church of Berkeley. A marble statue by Sievier has been\r\nerected to his memory in the nave of Gloucester Cathedral; and\r\nanother statue of him has been placed in a public building at\r\nCheltenham. Five medals have been struck in honor of Jenner: three\r\nby the German nation; one by the surgeons of the British navy; and\r\nthe fifth by the London Medical Society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The First Vaccination--Dr. Jenner.]\r\n\r\nDr. Jenner was endowed with a rare quality of mind, which it may be\r\nboth interesting and beneficial to sketch. A singular originality of\r\nthought was his leading characteristic. He appeared to have\r\nnaturally inherited what in others is the result of protracted\r\nstudy. He seemed to think from originality of perception alone,\r\nand not from induction. He arrived by a glance at inferences which\r\nwould have occupied the laborious conclusions of most men. In human\r\nand animal pathology, in comparative anatomy, and in geology, he\r\nperceived facts and formed theories instantaneously, and with a\r\nspirit of inventive penetration which distanced the slower\r\napproaches of more learned men. But if his powers of mind were\r\nsingularly great, the qualities which accompanied them were still\r\nmore felicitous. He possessed the most singular amenity of\r\ndisposition with the highest feeling, the rarest simplicity united\r\nto the highest genius. In the great distinction and the superior\r\nsociety to which his discovery introduced him, the native cast of\r\nhis character was unchanged. Among the great monarchs of Europe,\r\nwho, when in Great Britain, solicited his acquaintance, he was the\r\nunaltered Dr. Jenner of his birthplace. In the other moral points of\r\nhis character, affection, friendship, beneficence, and liberality\r\nwere pre-eminent In religion, his belief was equally remote from\r\nlaxity and fanaticism; and he observed to an intimate friend, not\r\nlong before his death, that he wondered not that the people were\r\nungrateful to him for his discovery, but he was surprised that they\r\nwere ungrateful to God for the benefits of which he was the humble\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT FULTON[8]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 8: Copyright, 1864, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy OLIVER OPTIC\r\n\r\n(1765-1815)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert Fulton.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few inventors have achieved success in giving to the world new\r\nor improved methods of carrying on the business of life without long\r\nand hard study, repeated experiments and failures, and trying\r\nstruggles with opposing elements. Many have labored through long\r\nyears of poverty and obscurity to dazzle their fellow-beings in the\r\nend by the triumph of genius. The idea of an inventor has almost\r\nbecome coupled with that of anxiety, patient or impatient waiting,\r\ntrials, and hardships. They are usually enthusiasts in the special\r\npursuit to which they devote themselves, and the coldness and\r\nincredulity of those whose approval they seek to win, wear heavily\r\nupon them. The chilling common-sense of men more practical than\r\nthemselves overwhelms them.\r\n\r\nIf the wonderful improvements of the present and the past age could\r\nbe placed in comparison with the attempts, the struggles, to\r\naccomplish what has now been achieved, the list of failures would\r\nfar outnumber that of successes. Many of those who have rendered\r\npriceless blessings to their own and after generations by the\r\nproduction of wonderful machines or methods from the fine fibre of\r\ntheir brains, were plundered and buffeted, even in the midst of\r\ntheir grand successes, to such a degree that it requires a lofty\r\ncomprehension to determine whether their lives were triumphs or\r\ndefeats. Sometimes the failure of one generation becomes the success\r\nof the next.\r\n\r\nBorn the same year that gave Robert Fulton to the world was Eli\r\nWhitney, who really made \"cotton king,\" so that the great staple of\r\nthe South yielded millions upon millions of dollars to the planters;\r\nbut he might have died a beggar, so far as his marvellous invention\r\naffected his fortunes. Before he had fully completed his machine for\r\nseparating the seeds from the cotton, which only two persons had\r\nbeen permitted to see, his workshop was broken open, and it was\r\nstolen. His idea was incorporated in other machines before he had\r\nobtained his patent, though it was only his own that transmuted\r\ncotton into gold. False reports, the repudiation of contracts for\r\nroyalties fairly made, the refusal of Congress, through Southern\r\ninfluence, to renew his patent, constant litigation to protect his\r\nrights, harassed his life, and robbed him of the pecuniary results\r\nof his success. Defeated, he gave up the battle, devoted his\r\nattention to the manufacture of firearms, and finally made a fortune\r\nin this business. Fulton's experience was not very different.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, important discoveries in methods and mechanical\r\nappliances have been made by accident, as it were, and fortunes\r\naccrued from very little labor or study; but these are the\r\nexceptions rather than the rule.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to estimate the influence upon the prosperity\r\nof the United States of steam-navigation. It came but a few years\r\nafter the organization of the Federal Government, when the greater\r\nportion of the territorial extent of the country was a wilderness,\r\nand preceded the general use of railroads by a quarter of a century.\r\nTransportation on the inland waters of the nation was slow,\r\ndifficult, and expensive, and the introduction of the steamboat upon\r\nits great lakes and rivers, notably upon the latter, was a new era\r\nin its history. On the great streams of the West flatboats floated\r\nfor weeks, laden with the productions of the States, on their way to\r\na market, where days or hours are sufficient at the present time.\r\nBetween the metropolis of the nation and the capital of New York,\r\nthe sloops, which were the only means of communication by water,\r\nrequired an average of four days to make the trip of about one\r\nhundred and fifty miles, while to-day it is accomplished in half a\r\nday or less.\r\n\r\nNow all the navigable rivers of the country are alive with\r\nsteamboats, and the growth and development of the States have been\r\nmainly indebted to the introduction of steam navigation. On the\r\ngreat lakes, though more available for transportation by means of\r\nsailing vessels, the same powerful agency has achieved wonders, and\r\nall of them are now covered by lines of steamers, by which, either\r\nas tow-boats or independent vessels, a large proportion of the\r\ninland commerce of the nation is carried on. On the ocean the result\r\nof the introduction of steam-navigation is even more impressive, and\r\nnations separated by thousands of miles of rolling billows now join\r\nhands, as it were, with hearts commercially united, if not more\r\nintimately, through the medium of peace-giving commerce, of which\r\nthousands of gigantic steamers are the angel-messengers. On the\r\nAtlantic a score or more of them leave the one side for the other\r\nevery week, and at the present time a merchant may breakfast in New\r\nYork on Saturday, and dine in London the next Saturday.\r\n\r\nIt is now conceded, both in Europe and America, that the world is\r\nindebted to Robert Fulton for the practical application of steam to\r\nthe purposes of navigation. Whatever has been claimed for or by\r\nothers in regard to the priority of the invention or application of\r\nthe mighty power of steam to the propulsion of vessels, Fulton was\r\n\"the first to apply it with any degree of practical success,\" as an\r\nEnglish work states it. As one who labored for years over the idea\r\nwhich came from his own brain, though it also came to others, who\r\nwellnigh sacrificed his own life in its improvement, and who\r\nachieved the crowning glory of its utility, he is certainly entitled\r\nto be regarded and honored as the Father of Steam-Navigation.\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton was born in a small village near Lancaster, in the\r\nState of Pennsylvania, in the year 1765. He was the son of a poor\r\nman of Scotch-Irish descent, who died when his son was only three\r\nyears old. He obtained only a common-school education, which he\r\nafterward increased by his own efforts. He early manifested a taste\r\nfor, and considerable skill in, drawing and painting, and he\r\nselected this art as his profession, though he was more inclined to\r\nmechanical occupations, and spent his leisure hours in the shops of\r\nthe workmen in his vicinity. He was somewhat precocious in his\r\ndevelopment, and at the age of seventeen he established himself as a\r\nportrait painter. He could hardly have attained to any high standard\r\nin art, though it appears that he had considerable success in his\r\noccupation, for at the age of twenty-one he had purchased a small\r\nfarm in the western part of the State, where he placed his mother,\r\nindicating that he had a proper filial regard for the welfare of his\r\nremaining parent. It was evident from this success that he had\r\ndecided talent and that it attracted the attention of others.\r\n\r\nHe was advised to visit England and place himself under the tuition\r\nof Benjamin West, the eminent American painter, who had achieved\r\ndistinguished success in art. He followed this advice, was kindly\r\nreceived by the great artist, and remained as an inmate of his home\r\nfor some years. In the palaces and mansions of the British nobility\r\nwere treasured up many of the most noted pictures of the day and of\r\nthe past. In order to see, study, and copy these, Fulton procured\r\nletters of introduction which gave him admission to these paintings.\r\nHe resided for some time in the stately mansions of the Duke of\r\nBridgewater and Earl Stanhope. Both of these peers were largely\r\ninterested in making internal improvements in England, especially in\r\npromoting inland navigation by canals.\r\n\r\nThe duke was the possessor of immense wealth, and he had invested\r\nlargely in companies connected with the canal system. Through him\r\nFulton became interested in the same subject, and his mechanical\r\ntastes and talent drew him in that direction. The result was that he\r\nabandoned his easel and became a civil engineer, a profession hardly\r\nknown by that name in the early part of this century. Earl Stanhope\r\nwas also of a mechanical turn of mind, and had projected some\r\nimportant enterprises. At that time he was engaged upon a scheme\r\nwhich afterward filled up so much of the existence of Fulton--the\r\napplication of steam to navigation.\r\n\r\nThe earl had devised a method of accomplishing the result, and had\r\ncaused a small craft to be built which was to be propelled by a\r\nseries of floats, by some compared to the paddles of a canoe, and by\r\nothers to the feet of water-fowls. He described his plan to Fulton,\r\nwho did not regard it as practicable, and stated plainly the reasons\r\nfor his belief. The earl clung to his idea, highly as he appreciated\r\nthe talents of the critic. The inventor resided at Birmingham about\r\ntwo years, and was employed in a subordinate capacity at his newly\r\nadopted profession for the greater portion of the time. In this city\r\nhe made the acquaintance of Watt, who had developed the steam-engine\r\nfrom a mere pumping-machine to something near what it is at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nFulton's inventive genius was exercised during his residence at\r\nBirmingham, and he devised an improvement of the machine for sawing\r\nmarble, from which he reaped both honor and profit. He produced a\r\nmachine for spinning flax, and for the manufacture of ropes, and\r\nalso one for excavating canals or river bottoms, for which purpose\r\nmany such are now in use. As an author he wrote a work on canals,\r\nand published a treatise on the same subject in a London paper. He\r\nhad a plan for the use of inclined planes in changing the level of\r\nthe water for boats on canals, in place of locks, after the manner\r\nof the Chinese, claiming that greater elevations could be overcome\r\nin this manner; but it was never adopted.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 Fulton went to Paris, where he resided seven years, as the\r\nterrors of the French Revolution were passing away. At this period\r\nhe had invented what is now called a torpedo, largely used in modern\r\nwarfare for the protection of harbors. He devised a submarine boat\r\nto operate these destructive weapons, which was not a success. He\r\ndemonstrated what he claimed for the torpedo in the destruction of a\r\nbrig of two hundred tons; but he failed to procure the adoption of\r\nthis more modern engine of warfare by either France or England, and\r\nhe had the honor to be snubbed by Napoleon I. In 1806 he returned to\r\nNew York, where he labored for the recognition and introduction of\r\nthe torpedo. He was encouraged by Jefferson and Madison, and\r\nCongress appropriated money for experiments; but the naval officers\r\nreported against him, and nothing came of his efforts.\r\n\r\nIn Paris he had made the acquaintance of Chancellor Livingston, then\r\nthe American minister to France, who was interested in Fulton's\r\nwork, and who soon entered into business relations with him in\r\nconnection with it. He was a man of abundant fortune, while the\r\ninventor was comparatively poor; occupied an elevated social\r\nposition, and was a person of great influence. He obtained a grant\r\nof the monopoly of steam-navigation from the State of New York.\r\nFulton took out two patents for his invention; but unfortunately\r\nthey were not adequate to his protection, for they covered only the\r\napplication of the steam-engine to the turning of a crank in\r\nproducing the rotary motion of the paddle-wheels.\r\n\r\nWhile in England Fulton had contracted with Watt for the building of\r\nsuch an engine as he desired, without stating the purpose for which\r\nit was to be used. This engine reached New York at about the same\r\ntime as the inventor. He made his plans for the construction of the\r\nboat, which was to be of different form and proportions from\r\nordinary vessels, and it was completed and fitted out with its\r\nengine during the year following his return. Not long before this\r\nevent, when he found the sum of money Mr. Livingston had provided to\r\ncomplete the steamboat was nearly exhausted, Fulton attempted to\r\nsell an interest in his exclusive grant in order to raise funds to\r\nsupply the deficiency; but so little faith existed in the success of\r\nhis enterprise that he could find no one who had the courage to\r\npurchase it. But the vessel was finished, and a trial trip was made\r\nin her, to which gentlemen of science and general intelligence were\r\ninvited, most of them, like the rest of the world, sceptics and\r\nunbelievers. A few minutes served to satisfy these men that the\r\nsteamboat was a success, and that the problem of steam-navigation\r\nhad been solved in its favor. It was the hour of Fulton's triumph.\r\n\r\nThe strange craft, to which the name of Clermont had been given,\r\nsoon made a trip to Albany, accomplishing the distance in thirty-two\r\nhours, or one-third of the average time of the sloops, and making\r\nthe return in thirty. Doubters and cavillers were silenced, and\r\nregular trips were made till the ice closed the river for the\r\nseason. During the winter the Clermont was lengthened to one hundred\r\nand forty feet, improved in many respects, gaudily painted, and\r\nlooked upon as a \"floating palace.\" Another steamboat, called the\r\nCar of Neptune, was built, and soon a contract for five more was\r\nplaced. The practical triumph had been achieved, and from that small\r\nbeginning has come forth the mighty steam-marine of the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFulton was married to Miss Harriet Livingston, a niece of the\r\nChancellor, and was the father of four children. His business\r\naffairs were in anything but a prosperous condition. The State of\r\nNew Jersey contested his monopoly, which proved to have been\r\nunconstitutionally granted. Fitch, or his successors, who had made\r\nsome successes in the same line, endeavored to supplant him, and his\r\npatents were worthless. He was embarrassed by constant litigation,\r\nand his last years were full of trials and anxiety. He died February\r\n24, 1815, at the age of fifty.\r\n\r\n[Signature: William S. Adams.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WILBERFORCE\r\n\r\n(1759-1833)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Wilberforce.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Wilberforce, whose name a heartfelt, enlightened, and\r\nunwearied philanthropy, directing talents of the highest order, has\r\nenrolled among those of the most illustrious benefactors of mankind,\r\nwas born August 24, 1759, in Hull, England, where his ancestors had\r\nbeen long and successfully engaged in trade. By his father's death he\r\nwas left an orphan at an early age. He received the chief part of his\r\neducation at the grammar school of Pockington, in Yorkshire, and at\r\nSt. John's College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow-commoner\r\nabout 1776 or 1777. When just of age, and apparently before taking his\r\nB.A. degree, he was returned for his native town at the general\r\nelection of 1780. In 1784 he was returned again, but being also chosen\r\nmember for Yorkshire he elected to sit for that great county, which he\r\ncontinued to represent until the year 1812, during six successive\r\nParliaments. From 1812 to 1825, when he retired from Parliament, he\r\nwas returned by Lord Calthorpe for the borough of Bramber. His\r\npolitics were in general those of Mr. Pitt's party, and his first\r\nprominent appearance was in 1783, in opposition to Mr. Fox's India\r\nBill. In 1786 he introduced and carried through the Commons a bill for\r\nthe amendment of the criminal code, which was roughly handled by the\r\nLord Chancellor, Thurlow, and rejected in the House of Lords without a\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Mr. Wilberforce was rising into manhood, the\r\ninquiry into the slave trade had engaged in a slight degree the\r\nattention of the public. To the Quakers belongs the high honor of\r\nhaving taken the lead in denouncing that unjust and unchristian\r\ntraffic. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, during the life\r\nof Penn, the Quakers of Pennsylvania passed a censure upon it, and\r\nfrom time to time the Society of Friends expressed their\r\ndisapprobation of the deportation of negroes, until, in 1761, they\r\ncompleted their good work by a resolution to disown all such as\r\ncontinued to be engaged in it. Occasionally the question was brought\r\nbefore magistrates, whether a slave became entitled to his liberty\r\nupon landing in England. In 1765 Granville Sharp came forward as the\r\nprotector of a negro, who, having been abandoned and cast upon the\r\nworld in disease and misery by his owner, was healed and assisted\r\nthrough the charity of Mr. Sharp's brother. Recovering his value\r\nwith his health, he was claimed and seized by his master, and would\r\nhave been shipped to the colonies, as many Africans were, but for\r\nthe prompt and resolute interference of Mr. Sharp. In several\r\nsimilar cases the same gentleman came forward successfully; but the\r\ngeneral question was not determined, or even argued, until 1772,\r\nwhen the celebrated case of the negro Somerset was brought before\r\nthe Court of King's Bench, which adjudged, after a deliberate\r\nhearing, that in England the right of the master over the slave\r\ncould not be maintained. The general question was afterward, in\r\n1778, decided still more absolutely by the Scotch Courts, in the\r\ncase of Wedderburn _vs._ Knight. In 1783 an event occurred well\r\nqualified to rouse the feelings of the nation, and call its\r\nattention to the atrocities of which the slave trade was the cause\r\nand pretext. An action was brought by certain underwriters against\r\nthe owners of the ship Zong, on the ground that the captain had\r\ncaused 132 weak, sickly slaves to be thrown overboard for the\r\npurpose of claiming their value, for which the plaintiffs would not\r\nhave been liable if the cargo had died a natural death. The fact of\r\nthe drowning was admitted, and defended on the plea that want of\r\nwater had rendered it necessary, though it appeared that the crew\r\nhad not been put upon short allowance. It now seems incredible that\r\nno criminal proceeding should have been instituted against the\r\nperpetrators of this wholesale murder.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 the Vice-chancellor of Cambridge proposed as the subject for\r\nthe Bachelor's Prize Essay, the question, Is it allowable to enslave\r\nmen without their consent? Thomas Clarkson, who had gained the prize\r\nin the preceding year, again became a candidate. Conceiving that the\r\nthesis, though couched in general terms, had an especial reference\r\nto the African slave trade, he went to London to make inquiries on\r\nthe subject. Investigation brought under his view a mass of\r\ncruelties and abominations which engrossed his thoughts and shocked\r\nhis imagination. By night and day they haunted him; and he has\r\ndescribed in lively colors the intense pain which this composition,\r\nundertaken solely in the spirit of honorable rivalry, inflicted on\r\nhim. He gained the prize, but found it impossible to discard the\r\nsubject from his thoughts. In the succeeding autumn, after great\r\nstruggles of mind, he resolved to give up his plan for entering the\r\nChurch, and devoted time, health, and substance (to use his own\r\nwords) to \"seeing these calamities to an end.\" In sketching the\r\nprogress of this great measure, the name of Wilberforce alone will\r\nbe presented to view; and it is our duty, therefore, in the first\r\nplace, to make honorable mention of him who first roused Wilberforce\r\nin the cause, and whose athletic vigor and indomitable perseverance\r\nsurmounted danger, difficulties, fatigues, and discouragements which\r\nfew men could have endured, in the first great object of collecting\r\nevidence of the cruelties habitually perpetrated in the slave trade.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of his proceedings, Mr. Clarkson, in the course\r\nof his application to members of Parliament, called on Mr.\r\nWilberforce, who stated that \"the subject had often employed his\r\nthoughts and was near his heart.\" He inquired into the authorities\r\nfor the statements laid before him, and became not only convinced\r\nof, but impressed with, the paramount duty of abolishing so hateful\r\na traffic. Occasional meetings of those who were alike interested\r\nwere held at his house; and in May, 1787, a committee was formed, of\r\nwhich Wilberforce became the Parliamentary leader. Early in 1788 he\r\ngave notice of his intention to bring the subject before the House;\r\nbut, owing to his severe indisposition, that task was ultimately\r\nundertaken by Mr. Pitt, who moved and carried a resolution, pledging\r\nthe House in the ensuing session to enter on the consideration of\r\nthe subject. Accordingly, May 12, 1789, Mr. Wilberforce moved a\r\nseries of resolutions, founded on a report of the Privy Council,\r\nexposing the iniquity and cruelty of the traffic in slaves, the\r\nmortality which it occasioned among white as well as black men, and\r\nthe neglect of health and morals by which the natural increase of\r\nthe race in the West India islands was checked; and concluding with\r\na declaration that if the causes by which that increase was checked\r\nwere removed, no considerable inconvenience would result from\r\ndiscontinuing the importation of African slaves. Burke, Pitt, and\r\nFox supported the resolutions. Mr. Wilberforce's speech was\r\ndistinguished by eloquence and earnestness, and by its unanswerable\r\nappeals to the first principles of justice and religion. The\r\nconsideration of the subject was ultimately adjourned to the\r\nfollowing session. In that, and in two subsequent sessions, the\r\nmotions were renewed; and the effect of pressing such a subject upon\r\nthe attention of the country was to open the eyes of many who would\r\nwillingly have kept them closed, yet could not deny the existence of\r\nthe evils so forced on their view. In 1792 Mr. Wilberforce's motion\r\nfor the abolition of the slave trade was met by a proposal to insert\r\nin it the word \"gradually;\" and, in pursuance of the same policy,\r\nMr. Dundas introduced a bill to provide for its discontinuance in\r\n1800. The date was altered to 1796, and in that state the bill\r\npassed the Commons, but was stopped in the Upper House by a proposal\r\nto hear evidence upon it. Mr. Wilberforce annually renewed his\r\nefforts, and brought every new argument to bear upon the question\r\nwhich new discoveries, or the events of the times, produced. In 1799\r\nthe friends of the measure resolved on letting it repose for awhile,\r\nand for five years Mr. Wilberforce contented himself with moving for\r\ncertain papers; but he took an opportunity of assuring the House\r\nthat he had not grown cool in the cause, and that he would renew the\r\ndiscussion in a future session. On May 30, 1804, he once more moved\r\nfor leave to bring in his bill for the abolition of the slave trade,\r\nin a speech of great eloquence and effect. He took the opportunity\r\nof making a powerful appeal to the Irish members, before whom, in\r\nconsequence of the Union, this question was now for the first time\r\nbrought, and the greater part of whom supported it. The decision\r\nshowed a majority of 124 to 49 in his favor; and the bill was\r\ncarried through the Commons, but was again postponed in the House of\r\nLords. In 1805 he renewed his motion; but on this occasion it was\r\nlost in the Commons by over-security among the friends of the\r\nmeasure. But when Mr. Fox and Lord Granville took office in 1806,\r\nthe abolition was brought forward by the ministers, most of whom\r\nsupported it, though it was not made a government question in\r\nconsequence of several members of the cabinet opposing it. The\r\nattorney-general (Sir A. Pigott) brought in a bill, which was passed\r\ninto a law, prohibiting the slave trade in the conquered colonies,\r\nand excluding British subjects from engaging in the foreign slave\r\ntrade; and Mr. Fox at Mr. Wilberforce's special request, introduced\r\na resolution pledging the House to take the earliest measures for\r\neffectually abolishing the whole slave trade. This resolution was\r\ncarried by a majority of 114 to 15; and January 2, 1807, Lord\r\nGranville brought forward, in the House of Lords, a bill for the\r\nabolition of the slave trade, which passed safely through both\r\nHouses of Parliament. As, however, the king was believed to be\r\nunfriendly to the measure, some alarm was felt by its friends, lest\r\nits fate might still be affected by the dismissal of the ministers,\r\nwhich had been determined upon. Those fears were groundless; for\r\nthough they received orders to deliver up the seals of their offices\r\non March 25th, the royal assent was given by commission by the Lord\r\nChancellor Erskine on the same day; and thus the last act of the\r\nadministration was to conclude a contest, maintained by prejudice\r\nand interest during twenty years, for the support of what Mr. Pitt\r\ndenominated \"the greatest practical evil that ever afflicted the\r\nhuman race.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other testimonies to Mr. Wilberforce's merits, we are not\r\ninclined to omit that of Sir James Mackintosh, who in his journal,\r\nMay 23, 1808, speaks thus of Wilberforce on the \"Abolition.\" This\r\nrefers to a pamphlet on the slave trade which Mr. Wilberforce had\r\npublished in 1806: \"Almost as much enchanted by Mr. Wilberforce's\r\nbook as by his conduct. He is the very model of a reformer. Ardent\r\nwithout turbulence, mild without timidity or coolness; neither\r\nyielding to difficulties nor disturbed or exasperated by them;\r\npatient and meek yet intrepid; persisting for twenty years through\r\ngood report and evil report; just and charitable even to his most\r\nmalignant enemies; unwearied in every experiment to disarm the\r\nprejudices of his more rational and disinterested opponents, and\r\nsupporting the zeal, without dangerously exciting the passions of\r\nhis adherents.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of Mr. Wilberforce's parliamentary conduct was consistent\r\nwith his behavior on this question. In debates chiefly political he\r\nrarely took a forward part; but where religion and morals were\r\ndirectly concerned, points on which few cared to interfere, and\r\nwhere a leader was wanted, he never shrunk from the advocacy of his\r\nopinions. He was a supporter of Catholic emancipation and\r\nparliamentary reform; he condemned the encouragement of gambling, in\r\nthe shape of lotteries established by government; he insisted on the\r\ncruelty of employing boys of tender age as chimney-sweepers; he\r\nattempted to procure a legislative enactment against duelling, after\r\nthe hostile meeting between Pitt and Tierney; and on the renewal of\r\nthe East India Company's charter in 1816, he gave his zealous\r\nsupport to the propagation of Christianity in Hindostan, in\r\nopposition to those who, as has been more recently done in the West\r\nIndies, represented the employment of missionaries to be\r\ninconsistent with the preservation of the British empire. It is\r\nencouraging to observe that, with the exception of the one levelled\r\nagainst duelling, all these measures, however violently opposed and\r\nunfairly censured, have been carried in a more or less perfect form.\r\n\r\nAs an author, Mr. Wilberforce's claim to notice is chiefly derived\r\nfrom his treatise entitled \"A Practical View of the Prevailing\r\nReligious System of Professing Christians in the Higher and Middle\r\nClasses in this Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity.\" The\r\nobject of it was to show that the standard of life generally adopted\r\nby those classes not only fell short of, but was inconsistent with,\r\nthe doctrines of the gospel. It has justly been applauded as a work\r\nof no common courage, not from the asperity of its censures, for it\r\nbreathes throughout a spirit of gentleness and love, but on the\r\njoint consideration of the unpopularity of the subject and the\r\nwriter's position. The Bishop of Calcutta, in his introductory\r\nessay, justly observes that \"the author, in attempting it, risked\r\neverything dear to a public man and a politician as such,\r\nconsideration, weight, ambition, reputation.\" And Scott, the divine,\r\none of the most fearless and ardent of men, viewed the matter in the\r\nsame light; for he wrote: \"Taken in all its probable effects, I do\r\nsincerely think such a stand for vital Christianity has not been\r\nmade in my memory. He has come out beyond my expectations.\" Of a\r\nwork so generally known we shall not describe the tendency more at\r\nlarge. It is said to have gone through about twenty editions in\r\nBritain, since the publication in 1797, and more in America; and to\r\nhave been translated into most European languages.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of his parliamentary duties, Mr. Wilberforce was\r\npunctual and active beyond his apparent strength; and those who\r\nfurther recollect his diligent attendance on a vast variety of\r\npublic meetings and committees connected with religious and\r\ncharitable purposes, will wonder how a frame naturally weak should\r\nso long have endured the wear of such exertion. In 1788, when his\r\nillness was a matter of deep concern to the Abolitionists, Dr.\r\nWarren said that he had not stamina to last a fortnight. No doubt\r\nhis bodily powers were greatly aided by the placid and happy frame\r\nof mind which he habitually enjoyed; but it is important to relate\r\nhis own opinion, as delivered by an ear-witness, on the physical\r\nbenefits which he derived from a strict abstinence from temporal\r\naffairs on Sundays: \"I have often heard him assert that he never\r\ncould have sustained the labor and stretch of mind required in his\r\nearly political life, if it had not been for the rest of his\r\nSabbath; and that he could name several of his contemporaries in the\r\nvortex of political cares, whose minds had actually given way under\r\nthe stress of intellectual labor so as to bring on a premature death\r\nor the still more dreadful catastrophe of insanity and suicide, who,\r\nhumanly speaking, might have been preserved in health, if they would\r\nbut conscientiously have observed the Sabbath.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1797 Mr. Wilberforce married Miss Spooner, daughter of an eminent\r\nbanker at Birmingham. Four sons survived him. He died, after a\r\ngradual decline, July 29, 1833, in Cadogan Place. He directed that\r\nhis funeral should be conducted without the smallest pomp; but his\r\norders were disregarded, in compliance with a memorial addressed to\r\nhis relatives by many of the most distinguished men of all parties,\r\nand couched in the following terms: \"We, the undersigned Members of\r\nboth Houses of Parliament, being anxious, upon public grounds, to\r\nshow our respect for the memory of the late William Wilberforce, and\r\nbeing also satisfied that public honors can never be more fitly\r\nbestowed than upon such benefactors of mankind, earnestly request\r\nthat he may be buried in Westminster Abbey, and that we and others\r\nwho may agree with us in these sentiments may have permission to\r\nattend his funeral.\" The attendance of both Houses was numerous. Mr.\r\nWilberforce was interred within a few yards of his great\r\ncontemporaries, Pitt, Fox, and Canning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR HUMPHRY DAVY\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TIMBS, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n(1778-1829)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Humphry Davy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boyhood of Davy has been sketched in some of the most\r\nfascinating pieces of biography ever written: the annals of science\r\ndo not furnish us with any record that equals the school-days and\r\nself-education of the boy, Humphry, in popular interest; and, unlike\r\nmany bright mornings, this commencement in a few years led to a\r\nbrilliant meridian, and, by a succession of discoveries,\r\naccomplished more in relation to change of theory and extension of\r\nscience, than in the most ardent and ambitious moments of youth he\r\ncould either hope to effect or imagine possible.\r\n\r\nHumphry Davy was born at Penzance, in 1778; was a healthy, strong,\r\nand active child, and could speak fluently before he was two years\r\nold; copied engravings before he learned to write, and could recite\r\npart of the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" before he could well read it. At\r\nthe age of five years, he could gain a good account of the contents\r\nof a book while turning over the leaves; and he retained this\r\nremarkable faculty through life. He excelled in telling stories to\r\nhis playmates; loved fishing, and collecting, and painting birds and\r\nfishes; he had his own little garden; and recorded his impressions\r\nof romantic scenery in verse of no ordinary merit. To his\r\nself-education, however, he owed almost everything. He studied with\r\nintensity mathematics, metaphysics, and physiology; before he was\r\nnineteen he began to study chemistry, and in four months proposed a\r\nnew hypothesis on heat and light, to which he won over the\r\nexperienced Dr. Beddoes. With his associate, Gregory Watt (son of\r\nthe celebrated James Watt) he collected specimens of rocks and\r\nminerals. He made considerable progress in medicine; he experimented\r\nzealously, especially on the effects of the gases in respiration; at\r\nthe age of twenty-one he had breathed nitrous oxide, and nearly lost\r\nhis life from breathing carburetted hydrogen. Next year he commenced\r\nthe galvanic experiments which led to some of his greatest\r\ndiscoveries. In 1802 he began his brilliant scientific career at the\r\nRoyal Institution, where he remained till 1812; here he constructed\r\nhis great voltaic battery of 2,000 double plates of copper and zinc,\r\nand commenced the mineralogical collection now in the Museum. His\r\nlectures were often attended by one thousand persons: his youth, his\r\nsimplicity, his natural eloquence, his chemical knowledge, his happy\r\nillustrations and well-conducted experiments, and the auspicious\r\nstate of science, insured Davy great and instant success.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic admiration with which he was hailed can hardly be\r\nimagined now. Not only men of the highest rank--men of science, men of\r\nletters, and men of trade--but women of fashion and blue-stockings,\r\nold and young, pressed into the theatre of the Institution to cover\r\nhim with applause. His greatest labors were his discovery of the\r\ndecomposition of the fixed alkalies, and the re-establishment of the\r\nsimple nature of chlorine; his other researches were the investigation\r\nof astringent vegetables in connection with the art of tanning; the\r\nanalysis of rocks and minerals in connection with geology; the\r\ncomprehensive subject of agricultural chemistry; and galvanism and\r\nelectro-chemical science. He was also an early, but unsuccessful,\r\nexperimenter in the photographic art.\r\n\r\nOf the lazy conservative spirit and ludicrous indolence in science,\r\nwhich at this time attempted to hoodwink the public, a quaint\r\ninstance is recorded of a worthy professor of chemistry at Aberdeen.\r\nHe had allowed some years to pass since Davy's brilliant discovery\r\nof potassium and its congeneric metals, without a word about them in\r\nhis lectures. At length the learned doctor was concussed by his\r\ncolleagues on the subject, and he condescended to notice it. \"Both\r\npotash and soda are now said to be metallic oxides,\" said he; \"the\r\noxides, in fact, of two metals, called potassium and sodium by the\r\ndiscoverer of them, one Davy, in London, a verra troublesome person\r\nin chemistry.\"\r\n\r\nTurn we, however, to the brightest event in our chemical\r\nphilosopher's career. By his unrivalled series of practical\r\ndiscoveries, Davy acquired such a reputation for success among his\r\ncountrymen, that his aid was invoked on every great occasion. The\r\nproperties of fire-damp, or carburetted hydrogen, in coal-mines had\r\nalready been ascertained by Dr. Henry. When this gas is mingled in\r\ncertain proportions with atmospheric air, it forms a mixture which\r\nkindles upon the contact of a lighted candle, and often explodes\r\nwith tremendous violence, killing the men and horses, and projecting\r\nmuch of the contents of the mine through the shafts or apertures\r\nlike an enormous piece of artillery. At this time, a detonation of\r\nfire-damp occurred within a coal-mine in the north of England, so\r\ndreadful that it destroyed more than a hundred miners. A committee\r\nof the proprietors besought our chemist to provide a method of\r\npreparing for such tremendous visitations; and he did it. He tells\r\nus that he first turned his attention particularly to the subject in\r\n1815; but he must have been prepared for it by the researches of his\r\nearly years. Still, there appeared little hope of finding an\r\nefficacious remedy. The resources of modern mechanical science had\r\nbeen fully applied in ventilation. The comparative lightness of\r\nfire-damp was well understood; every precaution was taken to\r\npreserve the communications open; and the currents of air were\r\npromoted or occasioned, not only by furnaces, but likewise by\r\nair-pumps and steam apparatus. We may here mention that, for giving\r\nlight to the coal-miner or pitman, where the fire-damp was\r\napprehended, the primitive contrivance was a steel-mill, the light\r\nof which was produced by contact of a flint with the edge of a wheel\r\nkept in rapid motion. A \"safety-lamp\" had already, in 1813, been\r\nconstructed by Dr. Clanny, the principle of which was forcing in air\r\nthrough water by bellows; but the machine was ponderous and\r\ncomplicated, and required a boy to work it. M. Humboldt had\r\npreviously, in 1796, constructed a lamp for mines upon the same\r\nprinciple as that of Dr. Clanny.\r\n\r\nDavy, having conceived that flame and explosion may be regulated and\r\narrested, began a minute chemical examination of fire-damp. He found\r\nthat carburetted-hydrogen gas, even when mixed with fourteen times\r\nits bulk of atmospheric air, was still explosive. He ascertained\r\nthat explosions of inflammable gases were incapable of being passed\r\nthrough long, narrow metallic tubes; and that this principle of\r\nsecurity was still obtained by diminishing their length and diameter\r\nat the same time, and likewise diminishing their length and\r\nincreasing their number, so that a great number of small apertures\r\nwould not pass explosion when their depth was equal to their\r\ndiameter. This fact led to trials upon sieves of wire-gauze; he\r\nfound that if a piece of wire-gauze was held over the flame of a\r\nlamp, or coal-gas, it prevented the flame from passing; and he\r\nascertained that a flame confined in a cylinder of very fine\r\nwire-gauze did not explode even in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen,\r\nbut that the gases burned in it with great vivacity. These\r\nexperiments served as the basis of the safety-lamp.\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy presented his first communication respecting his\r\ndiscovery of the safety-lamp to the Royal Society in 1815. This was\r\nfollowed by a series of papers, crowned by that read on January 11,\r\n1816, when the principle of the safety-lamp was announced, and Sir\r\nHumphry presented to the society a model made by his own hands,\r\nwhich is to this day preserved in the collection of the Royal\r\nSociety at Burlington House.\r\n\r\nThere have been several modifications of the safety-lamp, and the\r\nmerit of the discovery has been claimed by others, among whom was\r\nMr. George Stephenson; but the question was set at rest in 1817 by\r\nan examination, attested by Sir Joseph Banks, P.R.S., Mr. Brande,\r\nMr. Hatchett, and Dr. Wollaston, and awarding the independent merit\r\nto Davy.\r\n\r\nIt should be explained that Stephenson's lamp was formed on the\r\nprinciple of admitting the fire-damp by narrow tubes, and \"in such\r\nsmall detached portions that it would be consumed by combustion.\"\r\nThe two lamps were doubtless distinct inventions; though Davy, in\r\nall justice, appears to be entitled to precedence, not only in point\r\nof date, but as regards the long chain of inductive reasoning\r\nconcerning the nature of flame by which his result was arrived at.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Report by the Parliamentary Committee \"cannot admit\r\nthat the experiments (made with the lamp) have any tendency to\r\ndetract from the character of Sir Humphry Davy, or to disparage the\r\nfair value placed by himself upon his invention. The improvements\r\nare probably those which longer life and additional facts would have\r\ninduced him to contemplate as desirable, and of which, had he not\r\nbeen the inventor, he might have become the patron.\"\r\n\r\n\"I value it,\" Davy used to say, with the kindliest exultation, \"more\r\nthan anything I ever did; it was the result of a great deal of\r\ninvestigation and labor; but if my directions be attended to, it\r\nwill save the lives of thousands of poor men.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle of the invention may be thus summed up: In the\r\nsafety-lamp, the mixture of the fire-damp and atmospheric air within\r\nthe cage of wire-gauze explodes upon coming in contact with the\r\nflame; but the combustion cannot pass through the wire-gauze; and\r\nbeing there imprisoned, cannot impart to the explosive atmosphere of\r\nthe mine any of its force. This effect has been attributed to the\r\ncooling influence of the metal; but, since the wires may be brought\r\nto a degree of heat but little below redness without igniting the\r\nfire-damp, this does not appear to be the cause.\r\n\r\nProfessor Playfair has elegantly characterized the safety-lamp of\r\nDavy as a present from philosophy to the arts, a discovery in no\r\ndegree the effect of accident or chance, but the result of patient\r\nand enlightened research, and strongly exemplifying the great use of\r\nan immediate and constant appeal to experiment. After characterizing\r\nthe invention as the _shutting-up in a net of the most slender\r\ntexture_ of a most violent and irresistible force, and a power that\r\nin its tremendous effects seems to emulate the lightning and the\r\nearthquake, Professor Playfair thus concludes: \"When to this we add\r\nthe beneficial consequences, and the saving of the lives of men, and\r\nconsider that the effects are to remain as long as coal continues to\r\nbe dug from the bowels of the earth, it may be fairly said that\r\nthere is hardly in the whole compass of art or science a single\r\ninvention of which one would rather wish to be the author.... This,\"\r\nsays Professor Playfair, \"is exactly such a case as we should choose\r\nto place before Bacon, were he to revisit the earth; in order to\r\ngive him, in a small compass, an idea of the advancement which\r\nphilosophy has made since the time when he had pointed out to her\r\nthe route which she ought to pursue.\"\r\n\r\nHonors were showered upon Davy. He received from the Royal Society\r\nthe Copley, Royal, and Rumford Medals, and several times delivered\r\nthe Bakerian Lecture. He also received Napoleon's prize for the\r\nadvancement of galvanic researches from the French Institute. The\r\ninvention of the safety-lamp brought him the public gratitude of the\r\nunited colliers of Whitehaven, of the coal proprietors of the north\r\nof England, of the grand jury of Durham, of the Chamber of Commerce\r\nat Mons, of the coal-miners of Flanders, and, above all, of the\r\ncoal-owners of the Wear and the Tyne, who presented him (it was his\r\nown choice) with a dinner-service of silver worth £2,500. On the\r\nsame occasion, Alexander, the Emperor of all the Russias, sent him a\r\nvase, with a letter of commendation. In 1817, he was elected to the\r\ndignity of an associate of the Institute of France; next year, at\r\nthe age of forty, he was created a baronet.\r\n\r\nDavy's discoveries form a remarkable epoch in the history of the\r\nRoyal Society during the early part of this century; and from 1821\r\nto 1829 almost every volume of the _Transactions_ contains a\r\ncommunication by him. He was president of the Royal Society from\r\n1820 to 1827.\r\n\r\nFond of travel, geology, and sport, Davy visited, for the purpose of\r\nmineralogy and angling, almost every county of England and Wales. He\r\nwas provided with a portable laboratory, that he might experiment\r\nwhen he chose, as well as fish and shoot. In 1827, upon resigning\r\nthe presidency of the Royal Society, he retired to the continent; in\r\n1829, at Geneva, his palsy-stricken body returned to the dust. They\r\nburied him at Geneva, where a simple monument stands at the head of\r\nthe hospitable grave. There is a tablet to his memory in Westminster\r\nAbbey; there is a monument at Penzance; and his widow founded a\r\nmemorial chemical prize in the University of Geneva. His public\r\nservices of plate, his imperial vases, his foreign prizes, his royal\r\nmedals, shall be handed down with triumph to his collateral\r\nposterity as trophies won from the depths of nescience; but his\r\nwork, designed by his own genius, executed by his own hand, tracery\r\nand all, and every single stone signalized by his own private mark,\r\nindelible, characteristic, and inimitable--his work is the only\r\nrecord of his name. How deeply are its foundations rooted in space,\r\nand how lasting its materials for time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAN MARTIN[9]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 9: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy HEZEKIAH BUTTERWORTH\r\n\r\n(1778-1850)\r\n\r\n    \"Seras lo que debes ser,\r\n  Y sino, no seras nada.\"\r\n            SAN MARTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Martin, the ideal liberator of South America from the long and\r\ntyrannical rule of Spanish viceroys, was one of the most remarkable\r\nmen of his own or of any age. From a moral point of view he stands\r\nin the first rank of the world's heroes. \"He was not a man,\" said a\r\nstudent of South American history, \"he was a mission.\" Cincinnatus,\r\nafter serving the state, returned to the plough, and Washington to\r\nthe retirement of Mt. Vernon; but San Martin for the peace of his\r\ncountry went into voluntary exile. His country crowned him dead and\r\nmade for his dead body a tomb of Peace, surrounded by the marble\r\nangels of the arts of human progress, more beautiful in its meaning\r\nthan any tomb on the Appian Way, and one of the most wonderful\r\nmemorials on earth.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Maipú, of which San Martin was the victor, completed\r\nthe emancipation of South America, and made the achievements of\r\nBolivar easy in the Northern Andes. Said the hero of Maipú--and what\r\nwords of man under the circumstances ever equalled the declaration\r\nin moral sublimity!--\r\n\r\n\"The presence of a fortunate general, however disinterested he may\r\nbe, is dangerous to a newly founded state. I have achieved the\r\nindependence of Peru: I have ceased to be a public man!\" He died at\r\nBoulogne, France, in poverty, after nearly thirty years of exiled\r\nand fameless life. His career seems like that of some hero of\r\nfiction, such as the imagination of a Plato, a Bacon, or a Sir\r\nThomas More might create for an Utopia. He is the one perfectly\r\nunselfish man in history, and his fame has grown steadily in Spanish\r\nAmerica, since Argentina built a tomb-palace for his remains, and\r\ndecreed for him one of the most splendid funerals ever known to the\r\nWestern World.\r\n\r\nGeneral Don Joachim de la Pezuela, the last Spanish ruler of Peru,\r\nwas the forty-fourth viceroy from Pizarro. \"The Indians,\" he said,\r\n\"love the memory of the Incas--the country is ready to rise.\" The\r\nbanner of Argentina was putting to flight the condors of the Andes,\r\nand the last viceroy saw in its advance the end of Spain in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe Argentine hero who had created the army of the Andes for\r\nuniversal liberty was San Martin. He was born on February 25, 1778,\r\nat Yapeyu, in Misiones. His father was a South American officer\r\nunder the last rule of the viceroys. The family removed to Spain in\r\nhis boyhood, and he became for two years a pupil in the Seminary of\r\nNobles, at Madrid. At the age of twelve he became a cadet, wearing a\r\nuniform of blue and white, which he made in manhood the colors of\r\nSouth American emancipation.\r\n\r\nHe fought in the war against the Moors, and in the campaign against\r\nFrance, in 1793. In 1800 he took part in the so-called \"War of the\r\nOranges against Portugal.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century there began to be formed\r\nin Spain secret societies for the purpose of advancing the cause of\r\nliberty and human progress. One of these associations, called\r\n_Caballeros Racionales_, became very influential, and corresponded\r\nwith the society of the Grand Reunion of America (_Gran Reunion\r\nAmericana_) of London. This society was pledged \"to recognize no\r\ngovernment in America as legitimate unless it was elected by the\r\nfree will of the people.\" San Martin joined this society. The London\r\nsociety was established by Miranda, the Spanish patriot, a friend of\r\nBolivar, by whose inspirations San Martin became a disciple of\r\nliberty, and whose dreams he fulfilled long after the patriot was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nSan Martin won honors and a medal in the Spanish resistance to the\r\nvictorious eagles of Napoleon. In that campaign he fought under a\r\nbanner of the Sun, having this motto in Latin: \"We bear this aloft\r\ndispersing the clouds.\" He made this banner the flag of the army of\r\nthe Andes.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, San Martin, as a disciple of the principles of the Spanish\r\napostle of liberty, Miranda, returned to South America, and in March\r\nwent to Buenos Ayres, and offered his sword to the Argentine\r\npatriots for the cause of independence. The country was in\r\nrevolution against the Spanish rule. San Martin was not only an\r\nAmerican, but a Creole; he was unselfish, truthful, the soul of\r\nhonor, and of all men in the world the one that would seem best\r\nfitted to lead the cause of the South American patriots. He was\r\ndestined to become \"the greatest of the Creoles of the New World.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of San Martin in Buenos Ayres he married Doña\r\nRemedios Esculada, and Mercedes, a daughter of this marriage, shared\r\nwith him his voluntary exile after the conquest of Peru.\r\n\r\nAppointed at once to a high military position under the Argentine\r\nGovernment, he conceived the plan of creating an army of the Andes,\r\nof crossing the Cordillera, and of driving the Spaniards from Chile.\r\n\r\nMendoza, with which Buenos Ayres is now connected by railroad, lies\r\non an elevation under the snowy Cordilleras. San Martin made his\r\nmilitary camp here. On January 17, 1817, he began his march up the\r\nAndes, one of the most perilous achievements of modern warfare. The\r\nsummit of the Uspallata Pass, over which the army was to climb, is\r\n12,500 feet above the level of the sea, or 4,000 feet higher than\r\nthe Pass of St. Bernard.\r\n\r\nThe 17th, on which the army set forth, was a high holiday in\r\nMendoza. The plaza was gay with banners, and the streets with\r\npatriotic decorations. The ladies of the city presented an\r\nembroidered flag to San Martin. The general, above whose head\r\ngleamed the snowy heights of the Andes, ascended a platform in the\r\nplaza, and waved this flag over his head, and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers, behold the first flag of independence!\"\r\n\r\nThere arose a great shout of \"Viva la Patria!\"\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers, swear to sustain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear,\" answered the army, as one man.\r\n\r\nSalvos of musketry and artillery followed. Mitre, in his \"Life of\r\nSan Martin,\" as presented to us in the condensed translation of\r\nPilling, eloquently says that this flag rose \"for the redemption of\r\none-half of South America, passed the Cordilleras, waved in triumph\r\nalong the Pacific coast, floated over the foundations of two new\r\nrepublics, aided in the liberation of another, and after sixty-four\r\nyears served as a funeral pall to the body of the hero, who thus\r\ndelivered it to the care of the immortal Army of the Andes.\"\r\n\r\nThe mountains rose above the departing army, piercing the sky in the\r\nfading day. Up they climbed, putting to flight the condors. The men\r\nsuffered greatly from the rarefaction of the air. Even many of the\r\nanimals of the expedition perished. Out of 9,261 mules, only 4,300\r\never reached Chile.\r\n\r\n\"What spoils my sleep,\" said San Martin, on surveying the Andes at\r\nthe outset of the expedition, \"is not the strength of the enemy, but\r\nhow to pass those immense mountains.\" He might well say that, for\r\nbefore him gleamed peaks 21,000 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe army, with all its sufferings, triumphantly crossed the lower\r\npasses of the Cordilleras, and entered Chile. This march decided the\r\nfate of South America.\r\n\r\nThe army encamped upon the Sierra of Chacubuco, from the summit of\r\nwhich the whole of the magnificent country could be seen. Here rose\r\nthe flag of liberation. The flower of the Spanish army, inferior in\r\nnumbers, was near. On February 12th a battle was fought, and the\r\nroyalists were defeated with a loss of 500 men killed, 600 taken\r\nprisoners, and all of their artillery.\r\n\r\nThe way was now open to Santiago, the capital. The army entered the\r\ncity amid the acclamations of the people. The Chilian assembly met\r\nand offered San Martin the office of governor, with dictatorial\r\npower. But San Martin was not fighting for power, or honor, but for\r\nthe liberties of his countrymen, and he nobly declined the office.\r\n\r\nThe guns of Buenos Ayres roared, and the city was turned into a\r\nfestival when the news of the triumph of the army of the Andes\r\nreached the coast. The Argentine Government offered to bestow on San\r\nMartin its highest honors, but the latter declined them, lest his\r\nwork should be retarded and his motives of life should be\r\nmisconstrued. It awarded to his daughter a life pension, which he\r\ndevoted to her education.\r\n\r\nSantiago offered to him 10,000 ounces of gold. He refused the\r\nsplendid purse which he had so well won, but recommended that the\r\nmoney be used for the cause of popular education in the form of a\r\npublic library.\r\n\r\nChile and Argentina now formed an alliance in defence of their\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nBut the royal army was gathering force and unity. On March 31st, it\r\nnumbered 5,500 men, and was prepared to make a final stand against\r\nthe army of liberation.\r\n\r\nThere is a river in Chile which divides the country, named the\r\nMaipó, or Maipú. On its banks the royal army encamped on the first\r\ndays of April, 1818. The patriot army was close at hand, and each\r\narmy felt that the battle to follow would decide the fate of the\r\nmovement for the independence of the South American empire.\r\n\r\nIt is April 5, 1818. The royal army is ready for action, and the\r\npatriots occupy the heights of Loma Blanca, overlooking the plains\r\nof the Maipú.\r\n\r\n\"Do not await a charge to-day,\" ordered San Martin; \"_but charge_\r\nalways within fifty paces!\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the action he said,\r\n\r\n\"I take the sun to witness that the day is ours.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the sun, which had been clouded, shone from the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe royal army was defeated. That night of May 5th covered their\r\nflight, and the War of Independence was won.\r\n\r\nSan Martin began now to plan the liberation of Peru, and to create a\r\nnavy for the purpose of commanding the ports of the golden mountains\r\nand rich plateaus of the incarial realms.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1820, he had gathered a patriot force of 4,500 men at\r\nValparaiso, and was ready to embark for the conquest by sea. The\r\narmy was composed of Argentines and Chilians. A former expedition\r\nhad made the way of victory clear to the patriots. The fleet left\r\nValparaiso August 21, 1820. The army landed in Peru and began\r\noperations near Lima.\r\n\r\nSan Martin began his Chilian campaign by the liberation of the\r\nslaves, whom he afterward found trusty soldiers. He began the\r\nPeruvian war by issuing a most noble manifesto to his countrymen, in\r\nwhich he said: \"Ever since I came back to my native land, the\r\nindependence of Peru has been present in my mind.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he grandly announced his future policy in nearly these\r\nwords: \"From the time that a government is established by the people\r\nof Peru, the army of the Andes will obey its orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe army of liberation was as successful in Peru as in Chile. The\r\nempire of the viceroys crumbled and fell. Amid the roar of cannon,\r\nthe shouts of the people, and strewing of flowers, the independence\r\nof Peru was proclaimed on July 20, 1821, in the great square of\r\nLima. San Martin, as in Chile, was offered the supreme authority\r\nunder the title of the Protector of Peru. He made use of the office\r\nmerely for the pacification of the country. He convened the first\r\nCongress in Peru, and to the new government he addressed the words,\r\nor words like those, that we have quoted at the beginning of this\r\narticle. He saw that Bolivar was the man to complete the liberation\r\nand bring about the unity of South America. The cause was all to\r\nhim: he was nothing.\r\n\r\nTo Bolivar he wrote: \"My decision is irrevocable. I have convened\r\nthe first Congress of Peru. The day of its installation I shall\r\nleave for Chile, convinced that my presence is the only obstacle\r\nthat prevents you from coming to Peru.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent to Bolivar a parting gift, saying, \"Receive this memento\r\nfrom the first of your admirers, and with my desire that you have\r\nthe glory of finishing the war for the independence of South\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of chivalry has no match for the character of San\r\nMartin. Bolivar united patriotism and vanity; San Martin's glory was\r\nself-abnegation. At a banquet where the two were present, Bolivar\r\nonce offered the following toast: \"To the two greatest men in South\r\nAmerica--San Martin and _myself_.\"\r\n\r\nSan Martin followed with his toast. \"To the speedy end of the war;\r\nto the establishment of the republics, and to the health of the\r\nLiberator of Colombia!\"\r\n\r\nThe two toasts were photographs. Time is lifting the character of\r\nSan Martin into its true place among glorious men. He was a man who\r\nfought for peace. His life fulfilled his own motto: \"Thou shalt be\r\nwhat thou oughtest to be, or else thou shalt be nothing.\"\r\n\r\nOn critical occasions, his magnanimous soul rose to the sublimity of\r\nthis motto, and to the end of his life of glory and poverty he was\r\nalways able to say, \"I have been what I ought!\"\r\n\r\n[Signature: Hezekiah Butterworth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE STEPHENSON[10]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 10: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy Professor C. M. WOODWARD\r\n\r\n(1781-1848)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steam engine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFar in the north of England, near the Scottish border, by the shore\r\nof the German Ocean, is the county of brown and barren hills called\r\nNorthumberland, and its principal city, Newcastle, famous for its\r\ncoal. There is another Newcastle near the centre of England, so this\r\none is often distinguished by the name \"Newcastle-on-Tyne\"--Tyne\r\nbeing the blackest and dirtiest of all rivers.\r\n\r\nA few miles from Newcastle, up the Tyne, is the little mining\r\nvillage of Wylam, where, a hundred years ago, lived Robert\r\nStephenson and his wife Mabel. There was no style about Wylam, and\r\nfew evidences of wealth or culture. The houses straggled about near\r\nthe outlets of the coal-mines, and everything was as uninviting as\r\nit well could be. Stephenson's house, or rather \"shanty,\" had but\r\none room, and that had an earthen floor. Robert and Mabel were about\r\nas ill-furnished as their house; for neither could read, they had\r\nnot a book nor a print, and neither knew much more of the world than\r\ncould be seen, as they stood on the bank of the Tyne and looked\r\nabout on the neighboring hills and down toward Newcastle. In 1892 I\r\nrode down the valley of the Tyne, past Wylam, through Newcastle, and\r\nover the high bridge that our fireman's grandson, Robert, built in\r\nlater days. Few valleys are less attractive, and few seem less\r\nlikely to be the birthplace of epoch-making men.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephenson, the father of our hero, was a fireman, earning\r\ntwo shillings a day. He was sober and industrious, but as would be\r\nexpected, he never \"got on.\" He was a good story-teller, and\r\ntransmitted to his children healthy bodies and clear heads. George\r\nwas the second of six children, and he was born June 9, 1781, during\r\nour war for independence. His boyhood was uneventful enough. When\r\nthe weather was cold he was cooped up in their narrow home; he was\r\nout of doors whenever the weather would permit. He played in the\r\nstreet, ran errands, carried his father's dinner, and herded cows,\r\nas soon as he was big enough, for four cents per day. At fourteen he\r\nwas assistant-fireman, earning twenty-five cents a day, and at\r\nseventeen he was \"plugman.\" He was thus in contact with much that\r\nhad been achieved in the way of building engines and transporting\r\nmaterials on cars. But I must describe the engines then in use, and\r\nexplain what it was to be a \"plugman.\"\r\n\r\nThe coal-mines were so deep that, in spite of the valleys, they\r\ncould be drained only by pumps, and it was often more difficult to\r\nkeep the water out than it was to lift the coal out. The\r\nsteam-engine was then in a very incomplete condition, and both\r\npumping-and lifting-engines were crude and clumsy affairs. To be\r\nsure Watt, the mathematical instrument-maker, had invented the\r\ndouble-acting steam-engine, but few had been manufactured, and those\r\nin common use were \"atmospheric\" engines, known as \"Newcomen's\"\r\nengines. A pumping-engine had a long, vertical cylinder, with\r\narrangements for admitting steam at the top. The weight of the\r\npiston, piston-rod, and pump-rod, which ran down a shaft to the\r\nlowest point in the mine, being balanced by a counter-weight on a\r\nsort of well-sweep, the steam, admitted by hand, forced the piston\r\nto the bottom of the cylinder. The steam was then shut off, and a\r\nspray of water was turned on within the cylinder. This water\r\ncondensed the steam and reduced the pressure within to almost\r\nnothing, so that the air pressure on the exterior face of the piston\r\n(which amounted to over a ton for every square foot of surface)\r\ndrove the piston to the top of the cylinder, and lifted the full\r\nlength of the stroke a large quantity of water.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the office of engineer was not an easy one. It\r\nwas all he could do to take care of the steam end of the pump;\r\nanother man was needed to look after the lower end, where the\r\npump-valve worked in another vertical cylinder. The water entered\r\nthis cylinder through holes in the sides, some higher, some lower,\r\naccording to the stage of water in the mine. The pumps did not run\r\ncontinuously, but they lowered the water to the bottom as often as\r\nit was necessary. As the level of the water in the mine fell, it was\r\nnecessary to plug the upper holes in the pump cylinder; the man who\r\nwatched the lower end and plugged those holes was known as the\r\n\"plugman.\" It is difficult to conceive of a less inspiring\r\noccupation than that to which George Stephenson was promoted at the\r\nage of seventeen. Alone in the dark, chilled by the damp air, and\r\nwet by the black water, he was forced, by lack of other occupation,\r\nto note every mechanical detail of the machinery, and to study\r\nmethods of improving it.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen he heard of some wonderful engines made by\r\nWatt & Boulton, at their new factory, and was told that the engines\r\nwere fully described and illustrated in books. So he determined to\r\nlearn to read. He was encouraged in this resolve by stories that a\r\nFrench soldier, by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte, was sweeping\r\neverything before him on the continent of Europe, and that he was\r\nplanning the subjugation of Great Britain. Information about\r\nNapoleon could be gained from printed newspapers if one could only\r\nread.\r\n\r\nBut where should he learn? There was no public school in Wylam; none\r\nof our hero's companions went to school; none of the people he\r\nassociated with could read or write. However, he found a teacher in\r\na young man by the name of Robert Cowens, of whom he took three\r\nlessons per week in the evening. He earned money for books and\r\ninstruction by mending shoes and repairing clocks. He was handy with\r\ntools, and quick at seeing the relations of things. As soon as he\r\ncould read and write he learned to cipher, taking a slateful of\r\n\"sums,\" set by his teacher, to his work in the morning, to be \"done\"\r\nduring odd moments while watching his pump or engine, for he was\r\nsoon advanced to the care of the steam end of the machine.\r\n\r\nWhile young Stephenson, now grown a man, is thus busy with his\r\nprimer, his copy-book, and \"four rules,\" let us reflect upon the\r\nuncanny circumstances of his early life. He had no luxuries, few\r\nreal comforts. The people around him lived half the time underground\r\nin mines that were dark, damp, and dangerous--in constant war with\r\nwater and a poisonous, explosive, natural gas, known as \"fire-damp.\"\r\nAbove ground there was little that was attractive or educative. The\r\nyoung men had their games, at which George was fairly successful,\r\nfor he was strong and active. The ale-house stood near by, and it\r\nabsorbed most of the spare time and scant earnings of the miners;\r\nbut it is said that young Stephenson avoided the saloon, and was\r\nnever known to leave his work for a drink of liquor. On off days he\r\ntook his engine to pieces, examined its parts and the functions of\r\neach, and remedied small defects and devised improvements. Naturally\r\nclear-headed and ingenious, every circumstance tended to develop his\r\nexecutive powers. He soon was known in the Tyne valley as a good\r\nengine-doctor.\r\n\r\nAn incident, when he was about twenty years of age, did much to\r\nshape his career. He heard that a neighboring mine had been flooded\r\non account of the inability of the engine to pump fast enough. No\r\nengineer could make the engine efficient. One Sunday he went down\r\nand looked at it. After a thorough examination he said he could make\r\nit work in a week's time if he could have authority to make changes\r\nas he saw fit. Authority was given him. In four days the engine was\r\nrepaired and set to work. In spite of jeers from old engine-men, who\r\nwere jealous of a mere boy, the pump worked well and the mine was\r\nsoon dry. George's reputation was made, and he soon received\r\nappointment as engineer at a large mine at Killingworth, an\r\nimportant place near by.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Stephenson added exact instrumental drawing to his three\r\nR's. He found, as every artisan finds, that exact drawing is\r\nnecessary not only to the study of existing mechanical devices, but\r\nparticularly to the successful design of new parts. The successful\r\ninventor generally invents at his drawing-board.\r\n\r\nWhen twenty-one years of age Stephenson married Fanny Henderson, a\r\nrespectable country girl living at Ballast Hill. He brought the\r\nbride home behind him on a pillion, a wedding journey of fifteen\r\nmiles. Robert Stephenson, who became his father's partner, and one\r\nof the first of England's civil engineers, was born in 1803. In\r\n1812, when Stephenson was thirty-one years old, he was made\r\nengine-wright of a large colliery at Killingworth, at a salary of\r\n$500. The position was one of profit and fine opportunity. All the\r\nengines and machinery were in his hands, and all the repair-and\r\nconstruction-shops were available for such new designs as he saw fit\r\nto make. He at once set about making his first locomotive.\r\n\r\nLocomotives and railroads of certain sorts and fashions were already\r\nin existence, but they were rough and clumsy affairs.\r\n\r\nThe rails were at first angle-irons, then flat bars of wrought iron,\r\nthen cast-iron bars. In 1800 Benjamin Outram used stones for\r\nsleepers, and improved rails--hence \"tramways.\" Over these tramways\r\ncars were drawn by horses, or by ropes from stationary engines.\r\nMurduck made a locomotive in 1784, and by 1812 several types of\r\nengines were used for hauling coal-cars. Stephenson saw one of\r\nBlenkinsop's engines. Gear-wheels connected the crank-shaft with the\r\naxles, and the driving-wheels were geared with the track, while of\r\ncourse, the coal-cars ran on different rails.\r\n\r\nThis Blenkinsop's engine was a fearful machine. All the teeth\r\nrattled, and as there were no springs and the road was very uneven,\r\nthe shocks were heavy and frequent, even though its speed was only\r\nfour miles an hour.\r\n\r\nStephenson's first engine, \"My Lord,\" in honor of his patron, Lord\r\nRavensworth, was finished in 1814. Some experiments on the friction\r\nof smooth wheels on iron rails led him to omit the teeth on the\r\ndrivers, though everyone laughed at him, declaring that the engine\r\nwould not run an \"up grade,\" much less draw a load. His faith,\r\nhowever, resisted all arguments; it was based on experiments and\r\ncareful calculations. Stephenson _knew_ that his engine would run up\r\nhill and draw a load, and it did so triumphantly.\r\n\r\nBut the engine lacked steam. The boiler was small, and the fire was\r\napplied only on the exterior of the shell, and the draft was very\r\npoor, for the chimney was of necessity short. Only very low\r\nsteam-pressure was possible, and little or no expansion was\r\npracticable. Consequently the exhaust was noisy and forcible.\r\nStephenson turned it into the chimney and found that it increased\r\nthe draft considerably; he at once thought that a steady jet of\r\nsteam could be so directed as to make a strong draft even when the\r\nengine was not in motion. Thus the \"blast\" was invented, which about\r\ndoubled the capacity of the machine.\r\n\r\nStephenson's second locomotive, built in 1815, had no noisy gears,\r\nbut instead, chain-belts to the driving-axles. It had, however, no\r\nsprings, and the shocks were so great that only a low speed was\r\npossible. In 1816 he built locomotives with springs, some of which\r\nwere in use for hauling coals for forty years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robert was growing into a manly, useful lad. Knowing\r\nsomething of the value of education, both of the head and of the\r\nhand, his father determined that Robert should have the best of\r\nboth. He was sent to Edinburgh for scientific culture, and when at\r\nhome his father taught him drawing, mechanical processes, and the\r\ntheory of machines as far as he was able--and his ability was\r\nconsiderable, for George Stephenson was more of a student than many\r\nwhose early advantages were far better than his. The broad dual\r\ntraining given Robert appears to have been fully successful. Even\r\nbefore he became a man he was of great value to his father. Together\r\nthey worked out plans for modifying and improving the locomotive and\r\nthe road it was to run upon. He could soon draw and calculate better\r\nthan his father, but he never excelled him in the solution of\r\npractical problems which depended upon a knowledge of materials and\r\nthe simple laws of physics and mechanics.\r\n\r\nThus far all railroads had been short, leading from mines to piers\r\nfor shipping by water. The success of Stephenson's locomotive, the\r\nbest working locomotive ever built at that time, led the\r\nproprietors of the Hetton Colliery, a few miles south of the Tyne\r\nvalley, to propose a road, some eight miles long, over high hills\r\nand on steep grades. Stephenson planned and superintended the\r\nconstruction of the road as their engineer. There were several steep\r\ninclines where loaded cars going down drew empty cars up. There were\r\ntwo heavy stationary engines drawing cars by a rope, and five of\r\nStephenson's locomotives for the easy grades. Each locomotive drew\r\nseventeen wagons, weighing about sixty-four tons, at the rate of\r\nfour miles per hour. This was the best done as yet, and was\r\nconsidered a great success. It thoroughly established the reputation\r\nof George Stephenson as an engineer. This road was opened in 1822.\r\n\r\nBefore the Hetton Railway was opened Stephenson was busy on a larger\r\nwork. Parliament had given a franchise for a railway in Durham\r\nCounty, some twenty miles long, through Darlington to Stockton. The\r\nfunction of the road was to carry coal to a shipping pier, and it\r\nwas not at all settled that horses would not be used to draw the\r\ncars. While not much was known about railways, and very little about\r\nlocomotives, there was a growing conviction that there was great\r\neconomy in the use of tramways and the steam-engine, and the\r\nprospect brightened for building the road.\r\n\r\nThe charming biographer, Smiles, tells how George Stephenson called\r\non Mr. Edward Pease, the president of the proposed railway, and\r\noffered his services in building and equipping the road. Mr. Pease\r\nwas at once pleased with the man. \"There was,\" said he later, \"such\r\nan honest, sensible look about him, and he seemed so modest and\r\nunpretending. He spoke in the strong Northumbrian dialect, and\r\ndescribed himself as 'only the engine-wright at Killingworth.'\"\r\n\r\nStephenson urged at once that the road be built for locomotives. Mr.\r\nPease had never seen a locomotive at work, and had taken it for\r\ngranted that horses would be used; but he went up to Killingworth\r\nand rode on the \"Blucher\" with Stephenson, while it hauled a train\r\nof loaded cars. Seeing was believing, and Mr. Pease was in favor of\r\nboth Stephenson and his locomotive.\r\n\r\nSo Stephenson was made chief engineer. He and his son Robert\r\nsurveyed the line, changed the location, avoiding certain territory\r\nwhere people were hostile to a road of any sort, and built new and\r\nimproved locomotives for the line. What we now call good tools were\r\nnot to be had, and skilled workmen were not easy to find, but\r\nStephenson made a great advance in the quality of the workmanship.\r\n\r\nThe amended Act of Parliament gave the Stockton and Darlington line\r\nthe right to carry passengers in cars drawn by locomotives. This was\r\nthe first instance of such a grant. Stephenson met Mr. Pease in\r\n1821; the road was opened to the public in 1825. People came in\r\ncrowds to see the locomotives and to ride on the _first public\r\nrailway_. There had been bitter opposition to the road and a vast\r\namount of incredulity as to the ability of the locomotives to do\r\npractical work.\r\n\r\nImagine the excitement of the first ride. The train consisted of 6\r\ncars loaded with coal and other freight; then a short passenger\r\ncoach filled with directors and friends; then 21 open cars or\r\nwagons fitted for excursionists; lastly came 6 more cars loaded with\r\ncoal--making 38 cars in all!\r\n\r\nMr. Stephenson was proud to be on the locomotive and to run it\r\nhimself. It seemed to spectators incredible that the locomotive\r\ncould start such a load, but it did start it, and it drew it 8-3/4\r\nmiles in 65 minutes, the speed at times reaching 12 miles per hour!\r\nMore cars were added at Darlington, and then the train drew on to\r\nStockton, all cars being crowded with passengers.\r\n\r\nThe success was complete, and all doubts seemed to vanish. From that\r\nday the traffic over the road continued without interruption. To the\r\nsurprise of all, the passenger business became a very important\r\nitem, and better cars were quickly in demand.\r\n\r\nThe road is in use to-day, and I had the pleasure last year of\r\nriding over a part of it. Of course it now looks in all respects\r\nlike a modern English road, but I was deeply moved by the thought\r\nthat it was there that George Stephenson built his first public\r\nrailway and achieved his first public triumph.\r\n\r\nStephenson was not unmindful of the importance of that step. He\r\nsaid, on that occasion, to some young men, \"Now, lads, I will tell\r\nyou that I think you will live to see the day (though I may not live\r\nso long), when railways will come to supersede almost all other\r\nmethods of conveyance--when mail coaches will go by railway. The\r\ntime is coming when it will be cheaper for a working-man to ride\r\nthan to go on foot.\" He lived to see all that himself, and far more.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us to appreciate the popular surprise and\r\ndelight at that first railway excursion. We are so accustomed to\r\nsplendid engines, luxurious cars, and high speed, that we think\r\nnothing of them; but when all were new--when coaches and carts on\r\nhighways were the sole reliance for passengers and freight--it was\r\nastonishing indeed to see a \"travelling engine,\" in charge of two\r\nmen, draw a train of forty cars and six hundred people!\r\n\r\nMany men would have been satisfied with the result, but Stephenson\r\nwas not. He said there was no limit to the speed but the strength of\r\nthe machinery and the supply of steam. He saw there was no limit to\r\nthe load but the strength and weight of the locomotive, and no limit\r\nto the weight but the strength of the rails and the character of the\r\nroad-bed; thus he early saw how progress was to be made.\r\n\r\nBut Stephenson's greatest triumph was yet to come. The Darlington\r\nroad was chiefly for coals, between small towns in a rough northern\r\ncounty. The vast majority of English people heard nothing, and knew\r\nnothing about it. Consequently when it was proposed to connect the\r\ngreat commercial city of Liverpool with the great manufacturing city\r\nof Manchester, forty miles away, by a railway, it was taken for\r\ngranted that the cars were to be drawn by horses. Nevertheless a\r\ntram-road was opposed, first, by the Duke of Bridgewater, who had a\r\ncanal between the two cities; and, secondly, by those who owned the\r\ncoaches and the inns. Though proposed in 1821, the opposition was so\r\ngreat that it was laid over for several years. In 1824 a committee\r\nof interested parties went to Darlington and Killingworth to see\r\nStephenson's road and locomotives. The Darlington line was not yet\r\nin operation, but the old locomotives were at work at Killingworth.\r\nThe committee decided that they must have a double track for cars,\r\nwhatever might be the motive power.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Stephenson was invited to make surveys and estimates, as\r\nhe was said to be a man of great energy and the only man in England\r\nwith the necessary experience.\r\n\r\nThe surveys were made in 1825 with the greatest difficulty, on\r\naccount of the opposition of landowners. The surveyors were ordered\r\noff the grounds, threatened with arrest and violence. Stephenson\r\ntestified before a Parliamentary Committee that the duke's manager\r\nthreatened to have him thrown into the mill-pond if he trespassed.\r\nStephenson kept on as good terms as he could with the hostiles, and\r\nsurveyed their grounds by stealth.\r\n\r\nThe chief points of difficulty were a tunnel at Liverpool, and a\r\nvast and treacherous morass known as \"Chat Moss.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1825, before the Darlington road was opened, Parliament was\r\nconsidering the railway bill and Stephenson was called before the\r\ncommittee as a most important witness. All the opposition was out in\r\nforce and every means was used to ridicule the undertaking and\r\ndefeat the bill.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle presented by plain, blunt, unlettered George\r\nStephenson before the lawyers and members of the House of Commons\r\nwas strange and interesting, and no wonder it has become historical.\r\n\r\nIn the cross-examination, every effort was made to confuse and\r\ndiscredit the witness, but he bore himself remarkably well. He had\r\nbuilt or superintended half a dozen short railways, and had\r\nconstructed sixteen locomotives, and he could speak on the details\r\nof his plans with certainty and confidence. Two things embarrassed\r\nhim; the consciousness of awkwardness of manner and speech among men\r\nsome of whom were inclined to sneer at his northern dialect and lack\r\nof polish; secondly, the necessity of restraining himself in stating\r\nwhat his locomotives could do. He fully believed they could draw\r\nlong trains at the speed of twenty miles, but he was told by the\r\nfriends of the bill that if he made that claim before the committee,\r\nhe would be called a madman, and the bill would be killed;\r\naccordingly he promised to hold himself down to ten miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe evidence brought in against the bill was remarkable, and to-day\r\nit sounds strange enough. It was urged that the rails would bend\r\nunder the locomotive at high speed; that the engine would run off\r\nthe track on curves; that if the engine got round the curves the\r\ncars would go off; that the driving-wheels would \"spin,\" if they\r\nwent fast, without drawing the train; that the noise and sight of\r\nthe train would frighten horses and cattle; that hens would not lay\r\nand cows would cease to give milk along by the road; that the smoke\r\nwould poison the air and blast the fields and parks; that the coach\r\nlines would be ruined, horses would no longer be of value, and\r\ncoach-makers, harness-makers, inn-keepers and others along the great\r\nroads would have nothing to do, etc., etc. In the face of ignorance,\r\nridicule, contempt, and self-interest, Stephenson firmly maintained\r\nthe safety of a good road, the stability of his engines and cars,\r\nthe harmlessness of smoke and noise, and the facility with which\r\nanimals became indifferent to trains. He said that at Killingworth\r\ncattle would not stop feeding as the trains went by. As to the\r\neffect of speed, he boldly asserted that at twelve miles per hour\r\nthe load on a rail would be no more than at six, and in support of\r\nhis position he appealed to skaters who go swiftly over thin ice. As\r\nto the \"spinning\" of the wheels, he was positive that no such thing\r\never had happened or could happen. The enemies of the bill caught at\r\nhis suggestion of twelve miles per hour, and so pressed and led him\r\non that he declared his honest conviction that his trains could run\r\non such a road as he could make twelve miles per hour. This rashness\r\nalarmed his friends, and they tried in vain to smooth it over by\r\ndeclaring such speed to be purely \"hypothetical.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that could be said in its favor, in spite of the\r\npressing need of better transportation for coal, cotton,\r\nmerchandise, and passengers, the bill failed. Such was the\r\nblindness, and ignorance, and prejudice of the House of Commons!\r\nThink of calling George Stephenson \"an ignoramus, a fool, a maniac,\"\r\nin Parliament, yet such was done.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the bill were not discouraged; they determined to\r\napply again the next year; but poor Stephenson was discredited, Mr.\r\nGeorge Rennie, the great bridge engineer, was employed to make a new\r\nsurvey, and Mr. Stephenson was not called before the committee.\r\nMeanwhile, the Darlington line was opened, and reports of its\r\nsuccess had reached London. It seemed to be admitted that the _road_\r\nwas a good thing, but there was great scepticism in regard to the\r\nlocomotive. However, the bill passed in the spring of 1826, and the\r\ndirectors were not long in deciding that the only competent man to\r\nbuild the road was George Stephenson, and he was elected principal\r\nengineer at a salary of $5,000.\r\n\r\nThe building of the road seemed to be, and was at the time, a\r\ntremendous undertaking. Bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and above all,\r\nChat Moss, a yielding bog four miles across and of unknown depth,\r\nall taxed the engineer and the company to the utmost. The road was\r\nfinished in 1830. With the exception of bridges and rails it was\r\nvery much as it exists to-day.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the directors were undecided as to the method of\r\npropelling the cars. Nearly every engineer except Stephenson was\r\nopposed to the locomotive, or travelling engine.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible that Telford and the two Rennies, road-makers\r\nand bridge-builders, lacked faith in the locomotive, and preferred\r\nstationary engines and long cables. Their main objection to the\r\nlocomotive appears to have been based on the fact that the steam\r\ncapacity was small, and that it was impracticable to build a\r\nlocomotive large enough to furnish all the steam that was needed.\r\nStephenson insisted that already his locomotives were better than\r\nstationary engines, and yet they could be greatly improved. He said,\r\n\"Offer a generous prize for the best locomotive, and inventors and\r\nbuilders will greatly improve their machines, and we will have a far\r\nbetter locomotive than now.\" He said he felt sure he could make a\r\nmuch better one himself. By that time Stephenson was part owner in\r\nnew locomotive works at Newcastle, and Robert was in general charge\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe puzzled directors decided to adopt Stephenson's suggestion, and\r\noffered $2,500 as a prize for the best locomotive. The specifications\r\nrequired:\r\n\r\n1. The engine (without tender) must not weigh more than six tons.\r\n\r\n2. The ordinary steam pressure must not exceed 50 pounds above that\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n3. It must be well supplied with safety-valves and pressure-gauges.\r\n\r\n4. It must not exceed fifteen feet in height.\r\n\r\n5. It must rest on springs.\r\n\r\n6. It must be able (if weighing six tons) to draw twenty tons\r\ncontinuously ten miles per hour.\r\n\r\n7. It must not cost more than $2,750.\r\n\r\n8. The boiler must stand a pressure, when tested, of 150 pounds per\r\nsquare inch.\r\n\r\n9. It must be ready for trial October 1, 1829.\r\n\r\nThe publication of these conditions and the offer of the prize\r\nexcited great interest, and caused no small amount of comment.[11]\r\nThe Stephensons at once began the construction of \"The Rocket,\"\r\nwithout doubt the most famous locomotive ever built. The improved\r\nfeature it was to have was increased heating surface, so that\r\nwithout increased weight it could generate more steam. This was\r\neffected by putting fire-tubes through the water in the boiler.\r\nBoiler-tubes had already been used by different people, and some of\r\nStephenson's locomotives which he had sent to France had been fitted\r\nwith tubes. At the suggestion of Mr. James Booth, Stephenson decided\r\nto use a large number of tubes. Modern boilers have smaller tubes\r\nand more of them, but \"The Rocket\" was the first to typify the\r\nmodern multitubular boiler. In other respects \"The Rocket\" was like\r\nStephenson's other locomotives built ten or twelve years earlier.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 11: It is said that a prominent man of Liverpool\r\n         declared that \"only a parcel of charlatans would ever have\r\n         issued such a set of conditions; that it had been _proved_ to\r\n         be impossible to make a locomotive go ten miles per hour.\" He\r\n         added that, \"if it ever was done, he would eat a stewed\r\n         engine-wheel for breakfast.\"]\r\n\r\nA brief description of \"The Rocket\" will not be out of place: The\r\nboiler was 6 feet long, 3 feet 4 inches in diameter, and was\r\nfurnished with 25 copper tubes 3 inches in diameter. The fire-box\r\nwas at the rear end of the boiler, 2 feet wide and 3 feet high,\r\nsurrounded by water. The cylinders were high on the sides, pointing\r\ndown to the forward wheels, which were the only drivers. Stephenson\r\nhad used coupling rods between two sets of \"drivers,\" but \"The\r\nRocket\" was made for speed chiefly. Its weight when furnished with\r\nwater was only _four and a half tons_! On trial at Killingworth \"The\r\nRocket\" worked finely and its capacity for steam was marvellous. It\r\nwas sent by wagon to Carlisle and by boat to Liverpool.\r\n\r\nOn the day set for the trial there were four engines on hand: 1. The\r\n\"Novelty,\" built by young Ericsson, who afterward in New York built\r\nthe famous \"Monitor.\" 2. The \"Sanspareil,\" by Timothy Hackworth. 3.\r\nThe \"Perseverance,\" by a Mr. Burstall. 4. \"The Rocket,\" by\r\nStephenson and Booth.\r\n\r\nThe programme of test fixed by the judges was to run over a level\r\npiece of the road at Rainhill, two miles long, forty times during a\r\nday, at a rate not less than ten miles per hour. The train was to\r\nweigh three and one-third times as much as the locomotive. Each\r\nengine was to have a day for trial.\r\n\r\nThe \"Perseverance\" proved slow; its best speed was not more than six\r\nmiles per hour; so it was quickly withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sanspareil\" was made by one of Stephenson's own foremen, and\r\ndiffered little from the Killingworth style of locomotive. It was\r\nrather over weight, but it ran at times as fast as fourteen miles\r\nper hour. Its machinery was defective, however, and it was ruled out\r\nby the judges.\r\n\r\nThe \"Novelty\" ran at times in good style, but its bellows, for\r\nmaking a fire-blast, were defective and repeatedly gave out, causing\r\ndelay. It failed to make the required speed with a full load; by\r\nitself it is said to have run at the rate of twenty-eight miles per\r\nhour. Ericsson claimed that he had not had time to properly\r\nconstruct his locomotive, and the claim was probably just. As it\r\nwas, the time was extended six days.\r\n\r\nThe day assigned for \"The Rocket\" was the third day, but when on the\r\nsecond day all other engines failed, it was brought out to entertain\r\nthe spectators. Attaching it to a coach full of passengers,\r\nStephenson ran over the line at a rate reaching _thirty miles per\r\nhour_, to the amazement of all.\r\n\r\nThe next morning \"The Rocket\" was subjected to the regular test. Its\r\nassigned load was thirteen and a half tons which it drew back and\r\nforth over the two-mile track the full stent of forty times, making\r\na spurt at times as high as twenty-nine miles, about three times\r\nwhat had been declared possible by the judges! Finally, to show how\r\nfast the engine could go and still keep the track, Mr. Stephenson\r\nran it alone at the astonishing rate of thirty-five miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThus did \"The Rocket\" surpass all records and all expectations. The\r\nenthusiasm of every one was unbounded. All doubts were removed and\r\nStephenson's opponents in the company became his ardent friends. His\r\njudgment seemed infallible, and his word was law.\r\n\r\nThis victory at Rainhill completed the triumph of the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway. The road was opened the following year, 1830,\r\nwith most imposing ceremonies. Members of Parliament, lords and\r\nladies, and even the great Duke of Wellington, honored the occasion\r\nby their presence, and rode on the excursion trains.\r\n\r\nThe story of George Stephenson's great work is told. His railroad\r\nand his locomotive had come together, and to stay. All opposition\r\nwas crushed, and no sooner was one road in successful operation than\r\nanother, sometimes several, were on foot. George and Robert\r\nStephenson were in demand everywhere and their locomotive works were\r\nfull of orders. In twenty years England had nearly ten thousand\r\nmiles of railways.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of these two men, father and son, working together as\r\nequals was one often admired. Both became wealthy and full of\r\nhonor. Titled men were proud to pay their respects to George\r\nStephenson, and when he died, in 1848, at the age of sixty-seven,\r\nthe whole nation rose up to do him honor.\r\n\r\nThough probably Stephenson had never heard of Emerson, Emerson had\r\nheard of Stephenson, and he called upon him on his visit to England.\r\nAfterward Emerson said that \"it was worth crossing the Atlantic to\r\nhave seen Stephenson alone; he had such native force of character\r\nand vigor of intellect.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast that meeting offers! There face to face stood two\r\nmen, two great philosophers, both of whom have broadly and deeply\r\ninfluenced mankind--one by deeds, the other by words. One wielded\r\nthe pen, giving us noble, beautiful and inspiring thoughts,\r\nprofoundly analyzing life and character; the other wielded those\r\ncunning tools with which man subdues nature and harnesses its forces\r\nto do his will. He wrote not for the pages of a book, but on lines\r\nof steel with a stylus that conquered time and space, bringing\r\ndistant cities into companionship. I look up to each with an equal\r\nreverence. Each achieved the conquest of mind over matter, and each\r\nexhibited the exceeding manliness of a noble life and character.\r\n\r\nThere is no space with which to speak of Stephenson's safety-lamp,\r\nnor of the influence his life and character have had on the brain\r\nand brawn of working England. If my reader is interested to know him\r\nmore and better, let him consult the nearest library.\r\n\r\nOne word about \"The Rocket\" and this brief sketch is done. For some\r\nyears \"The Rocket\" did service on the Liverpool and Manchester road,\r\nbut it soon proved too light for the heavy traffic, and was sold to\r\na coal company in the North, where for years it faithfully hauled\r\ncoal-cars from the mines. But even there it was superseded, and in\r\ncontempt consigned to the back-yard. It was still fleet, but not\r\nstrong. In that dreary back-yard among useless lumber, the once\r\npeerless \"Rocket\" spent a season or two in rain and snow and sunny\r\nweather, when George Stephenson bought it back and put it in his\r\ncabinet at the Newcastle works. After Stephenson's death the\r\nprecious relic was placed in the British Museum in London.\r\n\r\n\"The Rocket\" itself was exhibited a few years ago at the Railway\r\nExposition in Chicago, and an exact copy of it was shown at the\r\nrecent World's Fair.\r\n\r\n[Signature: C. M. Woodward.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL F. B. MORSE\r\n\r\n(1791-1872)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel F. B. Morse.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Finley Breese Morse, artist and inventor, was born at the\r\nfoot of Breed's Hill, Charlestown, Mass., on April 27, 1791. His\r\nfather was the Rev. Jedediah Morse, D.D., the author of Morse's\r\n\"Geography.\" At the age of fourteen Samuel Morse entered Yale\r\nCollege; under the instruction of Professors Day and Silliman he\r\nreceived the first impulse toward those electrical studies with\r\nwhich his name is mainly identified.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Morse, whose tastes during his early years led him more\r\nstrongly toward art than toward science, became the pupil of\r\nWashington Allston, then the greatest of American artists, and\r\naccompanied his master to England, where he remained four years. His\r\nsuccess at this period was considerable; but on his return to\r\nAmerica, in 1815, he failed to obtain commissions for historical\r\npaintings, and after working on portraits for two years at\r\nCharleston, S.C., he removed first to Washington and afterward to\r\nAlbany, finally settling in New York. In 1825 he laid the\r\nfoundations of the National Academy of Design, and was elected its\r\nfirst president, an office which he filled until 1845. The year 1827\r\nmarks the revival of Morse's interest in electricity. It was at this\r\ntime that he learned from Professor J. F. Dana, of Columbia College,\r\nthe elementary facts of electro-magnetism. As yet, however, he was\r\ndevoted to his art, and in 1829 he again went to Europe to study the\r\nold masters.\r\n\r\nThe year of his return, 1832, may be said to close the period of his\r\nartistic, and to open that of his scientific, life. On board the\r\npacket-ship Sully, which sailed from Havre, October 1, 1832, while\r\ndiscussing one day with his fellow-passengers the properties of the\r\nelectro-magnet, he was led to remark: \"If the presence of\r\nelectricity can be made visible in any part of the circuit, I see no\r\nreason why intelligence may not be transmitted by electricity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not a novel proposition, but the process of formulating it\r\nstarted in his mind a train of new and momentous ideas. The current\r\nof electricity, he knew, would pass instantaneously any distance\r\nalong a wire; and if it were interrupted a spark would appear. It\r\nnow occurred to him that the spark might represent a part of speech,\r\neither a letter or a number; the absence of the spark, another part;\r\nand the duration of its absence, or of the spark itself, a third; so\r\nthat an alphabet might be easily formed, and words indicated. In a\r\nfew days he had completed rough drafts of the necessary apparatus,\r\nwhich he displayed to his fellow-passengers. Five years later, the\r\ncaptain of the ship identified under oath Morse's completed\r\ninstrument with that which Morse had explained on board the Sully,\r\nin 1832.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve years that followed Morse was engaged in a painful\r\nstruggle to perfect his invention and secure for it a proper\r\npresentation to the public. The refusal of the Government to\r\ncommission him to paint one of the great historical pictures in the\r\nrotunda of the Capitol, seemed to destroy all his old artistic\r\nambition. In poverty he pursued his new enterprise, making his own\r\nmodels, moulds, and castings, denying himself the common necessaries\r\nof life, and encountering embarrassments and delays of the most\r\ndisheartening kind. It was not until 1836 that he completed any\r\napparatus that would work, his original idea having been\r\nsupplemented by his discovery, in 1835, of the \"relay,\" by means of\r\nwhich the electric current might be reinforced or renewed where it\r\nbecame weak through distance from its source. Finally, on September\r\n2, 1837, the instrument was exhibited to a few friends at his room\r\nin the University building, New York, where a circuit of 1,700 feet\r\nof copper wire had been set up, with such satisfactory results as to\r\nawaken the practical interest of the Messrs. Vail, iron and brass\r\nworkers in New Jersey, who thenceforth became associated with Morse\r\nin his undertaking.\r\n\r\nMorse's petition for a patent was dated September 28, 1837, and was\r\nsoon followed by a petition to Congress for an appropriation to\r\ndefray the expense of subjecting the telegraph to actual experiment\r\nover a length sufficient to establish its feasibility and\r\ndemonstrate its value. The Committee on Commerce, to whom the\r\npetition was referred, reported favorably. Congress, however,\r\nadjourned without making the appropriation, and meanwhile Morse\r\nsailed for Europe to take out patents there. The trip was not a\r\nsuccess. In England his application was refused, on the alleged\r\nground that his invention had been already published; and while he\r\nobtained a patent in France, it was subsequently appropriated by the\r\nFrench Government without compensation to himself. His negotiations\r\nalso with Russia proved futile, and after a year's absence he\r\nreturned to New York.\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 1843, Congress passed the long-delayed appropriation\r\nof $30,000; and steps were at once taken to construct a telegraph\r\nfrom Baltimore to Washington. On May 24, 1844, it was used for the\r\nfirst time, Mr. Morse himself sending over the wires the first and\r\never-to-be-remembered message, \"What hath God wrought.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel F. B. Morse, Inventor of the Telegraph.]\r\n\r\nMorse's parents were already secured to him and his associates, and\r\ncompanies were soon formed for the erection of telegraph lines all\r\nover the United States. In the year 1847 he was compelled to defend\r\nhis invention in the courts, and successfully vindicated his claims\r\nto be called the original inventor of the electro-magnetic recording\r\ntelegraph. Thenceforward Morse's life was spent in witnessing the\r\ngrowth of his enterprise, and in gathering the honors which an\r\nappreciative public bestowed upon him. As years went by he received\r\nfrom the various foreign governments their highest distinctions,\r\nwhile in 1858 the representatives of Austria, Belgium, France, the\r\nNetherlands, Piedmont, Russia, the Holy See, Sweden, Tuscany, and\r\nTurkey appropriated the sum of 400,000 francs in recognition of the\r\nuse of his instruments in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph is not the only great success with which the name of\r\nSamuel Morse is honorably connected. Having made the acquaintance of\r\nDaguerre in Paris, he studied with him the infancy of photography,\r\nand was the first to take sun pictures, or daguerreotypes, in\r\nAmerica. Also it was he who made the first submarine electric cable.\r\nThis was laid in New York Harbor; and from it he was the first to\r\nconceive that stupendous idea of the transoceanic telegraph. In the\r\npreparations for laying the first Atlantic cable he took an active\r\npart, though the attempt of 1857, in which he personally engaged,\r\nwas not successful. He died April 2, 1872, at New York, where his\r\nstatue in bronze now stands in the Central Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER COOPER[12]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 12: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy CLARENCE COOK\r\n\r\n(1791-1883)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peter Cooper.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be said, without exaggeration, that few men in our time and\r\ncountry, not occupying official position, have been so widely and\r\nsincerely mourned as the late Peter Cooper. Other men have been as\r\ngenuinely good as he, and have founded charitable institutions as\r\nworthy and as useful, in their way, as the one which is to be the\r\nlasting monument to his memory. But Peter Cooper held a place in the\r\nhearts of his fellow-citizens which belonged to him alone. A man, to\r\noutward seeming, in manners and conversation as plain and homespun\r\nas his name, he held unshaken from youth to old age--and to few men\r\nis it allotted to live in uninterrupted health and action to the age\r\nof ninety-two--the confidence, the respect and the affection of all\r\nsorts of people: the rich and the poor, the high and the low, the\r\nlearned and the unlearned, people of all parties and of all\r\nreligions. Character is the accumulation of little actions, and\r\nmakes its deepest impression, of course, when these actions have\r\nbeen observed by great numbers of people during a long period of\r\ntime. The whole of his ninety-two years, with the exception of a\r\nshort time passed in his youth in its vicinity, were spent by Mr.\r\nCooper in the city of New York. It was little more than a country\r\ntown when he was born; it was already one of the great cities of the\r\nworld when he died; and in all that time he had been associated with\r\nthe business enterprises that had helped its growth, as one of the\r\nchief actors.\r\n\r\nThe fortune that he built up was both earned and expended here; the\r\nmanner of its earning was known of all men, but the way in which it\r\nwas expended was rather felt than known, for, like all great and\r\ngenerous benefactors, Mr. Cooper was without ostentation; but as he\r\ngave while he was alive and all the time that he was alive; and as\r\nhe gave to the people among whom he lived, and not to outsiders, it\r\nnaturally followed that his name, his person, his traits of\r\ncharacter, became, as it were, a common possession to the people of\r\nNew York; but few men upon whom such a glare of publicity had fallen\r\nfor so many years would have been able to bear the scrutiny so well\r\nas Peter Cooper.\r\n\r\nHe was born on February 12, 1791, presumably in Little Dock Street,\r\nnow Water Street, Coenties Slip, where his father, John Cooper,\r\ncarried on the trade of a hatter. His shop was near the store of\r\nJohn Jacob Astor, from whom he bought the beaver-skins which he made\r\nup into hats. John Cooper had served in the war of the Revolution,\r\nand when it ended, he retired with the rank of lieutenant. He\r\nmarried Margaret, the daughter of John Campbell, who also had served\r\nin the Continental army, as quartermaster, and who now carried on\r\nthe trade of potter and tile-maker on the spot where St. Paul's\r\nChapel now stands.\r\n\r\nTo John and Margaret Cooper nine children were born, two daughters\r\nand seven sons, of whom Peter was the fifth, and was named after the\r\napostle in the belief, as his father expressed it, that he would\r\ncome to something. Following the fashion of the time, he was set to\r\nwork at his father's trade as soon as he was old enough to work, as\r\nall his brothers had been before him: and in later years he\r\ndescribed himself as a little boy, with his head just reaching the\r\ntop of the table where he was set to pulling out the hairs from\r\nrabbit skins to use in making fur hats; and he was kept at the\r\nbusiness until he was fifteen, when, as he used to tell, he had\r\nlearned to make every part of a hat. So independent is business\r\nsuccess of what is commonly called education, that it may be of\r\ninterest to record that Peter Cooper never went to school for more\r\nthan one year, and only in the half of each day of school: his\r\nparents were poor, and could not spare what his labor earned, and\r\nbesides his health was delicate, and the confinement of school was\r\nthought more injurious to him than the work in the shop. In\r\nconsequence of this restriction Peter Cooper grew to manhood with\r\nvery little learning beyond reading, writing, and the rudiments of\r\narithmetic, and while this was a source of regret to him all his\r\nlife, it was in reality the spur that drove him to found an\r\ninstitution that should take away all excuses for ignorance from the\r\ncoming generations of poor boys in his native city.\r\n\r\nThe elder Cooper would seem to have been a man of small practical\r\ncapacity or staying power, for he moved about from place to place,\r\nchanging his business in the hope of bettering his condition; now\r\ngoing to Peekskill to set up a brewery; thence to Catskill, where\r\nhe added brick-making to making beer; then to Brooklyn to try\r\nhatting again; and finally to Newburgh, where he returned to\r\nbrewing. In all these shiftings of home and business Peter remained\r\nwith his father and gave him what help he could; he used in later\r\nlife to recall his carrying about the beer-kegs to his father's\r\ncustomers; but at the age of seventeen, with his parents' consent,\r\nhe came back to New York, and looked about for work on his own\r\naccount. He had saved up from his small earnings, while with his\r\nfather, the sum of ten dollars, and with this, he tells us, he\r\nbought a lottery ticket, which drew a blank. This seeming misfortune\r\nhe turned to good account, for he then determined never to trust to\r\nluck again, but to be content to earn his bread in the appointed\r\nway: it was his first and last speculation. On reaching New York he\r\nhad the usual difficulty in finding employment, but at length was\r\naccepted as an apprentice by a firm of carriage-makers, to whom,\r\nwith his father's consent, he bound himself until he should come of\r\nage; his masters agreeing to pay him $25 a year and his board. His\r\ngrandmother had a house on Broadway, in which she gave him the use\r\nof an upper room, and here in his spare hours he employed himself in\r\nwood-carving, in which he acquired some proficiency. In his business\r\nhe worked so industriously, and made himself so valuable to his\r\nemployers, that when his time expired they offered to lend him the\r\nmoney to go into business for himself; but he did not accept this\r\ngenerous offer, as he was determined never to be in debt. While with\r\nMessrs. Burtis and Woodward he had invented a machine for mortising\r\nwheel-hubs, thus giving the first evidence of an inventive faculty\r\nwhich, though never accomplishing great things, was often of\r\nconsiderable service both to himself and the community. On leaving\r\nthe business of carriage-making Peter Cooper went to Hempstead, L.\r\nI., where he found work in a woollen factory. Here he invented and\r\npatented an improvement on the machine in use for shearing the nap\r\nof cloth; and as during the war of 1812 all commerce with England\r\nceased, cloth-making in America flourished, and from the sale of his\r\nmachines, which he could hardly make fast enough to supply the\r\ndemand, young Cooper reaped a considerable profit. One of his first\r\ncustomers was the late Matthew Vassar, of Poughkeepsie, to whom he\r\nnot only sold some of his machines, but also the right to dispose of\r\nthem in Dutchess County. When he found that his earnings had enabled\r\nhim to lay by the sum of $500, he thought himself justified in\r\nasking a young woman, Miss Sarah Bedel, whom he had met when in\r\nHempstead, to become his wife; but before doing so, he determined to\r\nvisit his parents in Newburgh, and inform them of his intention. He\r\nfound them in great trouble, his father in debt and needing help;\r\nand without hesitation he placed his small savings at his disposal,\r\npaid the most pressing of the debts, and made arrangements for\r\npaying off the rest. His father was thus saved from bankruptcy by\r\nhis son's devotion; but the action was characteristic of Peter\r\nCooper, both in its unselfishness, and as indicative of his business\r\nintegrity. He would never be in debt himself, and he was equally\r\nresolved to keep those belonging to him as free as himself. He took\r\npride in the fact that neither he nor his father had ever failed in\r\nbusiness; and this is the more remarkable, since in the course of\r\nhis business life the country passed through no less than ten\r\nserious commercial panics.\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper and Miss Bedel were married on December 22, 1813, when\r\nhe was twenty-two and the lady twenty-one. Their married life, as it\r\nwas exceptionally long, so it was exceptionally happy. It lasted\r\nfifty-six years; Mrs. Cooper died in 1869, and Mr. Cooper survived\r\nher fourteen years, dying in 1883. Their golden wedding was\r\ncelebrated in 1863. They had six children, but only two lived to\r\ngrow up; the Hon. Edward Cooper, once mayor of the city, and Sarah\r\nAmelia Cooper, the wife of the Hon. Abram S. Hewitt. Mr. James\r\nParton says: \"There never was a happier marriage than this. To old\r\nage Mr. Cooper never sat near his wife without holding her hand in\r\nhis. He never spoke to her, nor of her, without some tender epithet.\r\nHe attributed the great happiness of his life and most of his\r\nsuccess to her admirable qualities. She seconded every good impulse\r\nof his benevolence, and made the fulfilment of his great scheme\r\npossible by her wise and resolute economy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper seems to have inherited something of his father's\r\nbusiness restlessness, for in addition to the many pursuits in which\r\nwe have seen him engage, he now bought a grocery stand, and in about\r\na year gave that up and purchased a glue factory, selling his\r\ngrocery business and buying a lease of the glue factory for\r\ntwenty-one years, for $2,000, his whole savings. He differed from\r\nhis father in this, that everything prospered with which he had to\r\ndo. The grocery had done well, but the glue factory did better. \"At\r\nthat time nearly all the glue used in this country was imported from\r\nIreland, and sold at a high price. Mr. Cooper studied the subject\r\nand experimented, until he was able to make better glue than the\r\nIrish and sell it at a lower price, and he soon had nearly the\r\nentire glue business of the country in his hands.\" But chance had\r\nnothing to do with Mr. Cooper's success: the secret of that success\r\nwas unremitting industry and generous economy. He worked that he\r\nmight earn, and he saved that he might use and give. For twenty\r\nyears while he held the glue factory, he was his own bookkeeper,\r\nclerk, and salesman; going to the factory at daybreak to light the\r\nfires, and spending the evenings at home, posting his books,\r\nwriting, and reading to his family.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, moved by the interest in business circles in the completion\r\nof the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Mr. Cooper, with two partners,\r\nbought a tract of three thousand acres within the city limits of\r\nBaltimore. By the failure of his associates to meet the payment of\r\ntheir shares, Mr. Cooper was obliged to shoulder the whole cost,\r\namounting to $105,000. The road, too, owing to unexpected\r\ndifficulties in construction, was dreading bankruptcy, from which it\r\nwas saved by Mr. Cooper's ingenuity in devising a locomotive that\r\nenabled the company to overcome certain difficulties that had been\r\nthought insurmountable. Failing in the end to sell his land as he\r\nhad hoped, Mr. Cooper decided to utilize the timber growing on it in\r\nthe manufacture of charcoal iron. When he had, after many\r\ndifficulties, established his works, he sold out to some Boston\r\ncapitalists, who formed the Canton Iron Company. Mr. Cooper took a\r\nlarge part of the purchase in stock at $45 a share, which he finally\r\nsold out at $230 a share.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of his interest in the iron business, where\r\nthe greater part of his fortune was made. The remainder came from\r\nhis glue works and the industries connected with them. In 1873, the\r\nyear of the great panic, in a letter to President Grant suggesting\r\nremedial legislation, Mr. Cooper said that not less than a thousand\r\npersons depended for their bread on the business carried on in the\r\ncircle of his family. He had at that time two rolling-mills running,\r\nand two mills for the manufacture of wire and springs; and his glue,\r\noil, and isinglass works gave employment to two hundred persons.\r\n\r\nThe story of Mr. Cooper's connection with the laying of the Atlantic\r\ncable has been so often told, that we do not repeat it here. It adds\r\nfurther testimony to his indomitable energy, his largeness of view,\r\nhis financial ability, and the confidence that was felt in him by\r\nhis fellow-men. The story of the difficulties, failures and final\r\nsuccess of this grandest achievement of modern science and\r\nenterprise, is as romantic as any episode in social history.\r\n\r\nBut, in Peter Cooper's view, the most important event in his\r\nlife--the one to which all his energies, his thoughts, his economics\r\nhad been steadily directed since his youth--was the founding of the\r\ninstitution that bears his name, and that has made him a powerful\r\nfactor in the development of New York. It was the outcome, in the\r\nfirst place, of its founder's regret for the deficiencies of his own\r\nearly training, which were owing partly to his parents' poverty and\r\npartly to the lack of public or free schools in his native city when\r\nhe was a boy. But this regret, which could only have been felt by a\r\nman of superior intelligence, was made to flower in this great\r\nresult by Mr. Cooper's genuine, deep, and unfailing love for his\r\nfellow-men, and his belief in the duty of every man to help the race\r\nforward in its progress to a better social condition. He has himself\r\nstated the principles on which his life was founded. His aim was \"to\r\nrender some equivalent to society, in some useful form of labor, for\r\neach day of his existence;\" and \"while he had always recognized that\r\nthe object of business is to make money in an honorable manner, he\r\nhad endeavored to remember that the object of life is to do good.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Mr. Cooper was nominated for the presidency by the National\r\nIndependent or \"Greenback\" party. It was with no selfish ambition\r\nthat he allowed his name to go before the voters of the country, and\r\nhis only regret at the result was that a policy was defeated which\r\nhe believed to be for the public good.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper died April 4, 1883, at the age of ninety-two, after a\r\nshort illness, the result of a cold. At his funeral, the late Dr.\r\nCrosby said: \"What an example has been set by this life to our young\r\nmen! How it shows them what the true aim of life should be! What an\r\nexample to our wealthy men to show that money obtained by honest\r\nindustry, and spent in benefiting mankind, will never produce war\r\nbetween labor and capital, but will assuage all angry elements, and\r\ngive universal peace! Oh! if all our wealthy men were like Peter\r\nCooper, all classes would be satisfied, all commotions cease, and\r\nthe community would be as near perfection--as near perfection in the\r\npecuniary view--as it possibly could be on earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Signature: Clarence Cook.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS KOSSUTH\r\n\r\n(1802-1894)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis Kossuth.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Kossuth was born at Monok, in Zemplin, one of the northern\r\ncounties of Hungary, April 21, 1802. His family was ancient, but\r\nimpoverished; his father served in the Austrian army during the wars\r\nagainst Napoleon; his mother is represented to have been a woman of\r\nextraordinary force of mind and character. Kossuth thus adds another\r\nto the long list of great men who seem to have inherited their\r\ngenius from their mothers. As a boy he was remarkable for the\r\nwinning gentleness of his disposition, and for an earnest\r\nenthusiasm, which gave promise of future eminence, could he but\r\nbreak the bonds imposed by low birth and iron fortune. A young\r\nclergyman was attracted by the character of the boy, and voluntarily\r\ntook upon himself the office of his tutor, and thus first opened\r\nbefore his mind visions of a broader world than that of the\r\nmiserable village of his residence. But these serene days of power\r\nexpanding under genial guidance soon passed away. His father died,\r\nhis tutor was translated to another post, and the walls of his\r\nprison-house seemed again to close upon the boy. But by the aid of\r\nmembers of his family, themselves in humble circumstances, he was\r\nenabled to attend such schools as the district furnished. Little\r\nworth knowing was taught there; but among that little was the Latin\r\nlanguage; and through that door the young dreamer was introduced\r\ninto the broad domains of history, where, abandoning the mean\r\npresent, he could range at will through the immortal past.\r\n\r\nIn times of peace the law offers to an aspiring youth the readiest\r\nmeans of ascent from a low degree to lofty stations. Kossuth,\r\ntherefore, when just entering upon manhood, made his way to Pesth,\r\nthe capital, to study the legal profession. Here he entered the\r\noffice of a notary, and began gradually to make himself known by his\r\nliberal opinions and the fervid eloquence with which he set forth\r\nand maintained them; and men began to see in him the promise of a\r\npowerful public writer, orator, and debater.\r\n\r\nThe man and the hour were alike preparing. In 1825, the year before\r\nKossuth arrived at Pesth, the critical state of her Italian\r\npossessions compelled Austria to provide extraordinary revenues. The\r\nHungarian Diet was then assembled, after an interval of thirteen\r\nyears. This Diet at once demanded certain measures of reform before\r\nthey would make the desired pecuniary grants. The court was obliged\r\nto concede these demands. Kossuth, having completed his legal\r\nstudies, and finding no favorable opening in the capital, returned,\r\nin 1830, to his native district, and commenced the practice of the\r\nlaw, with marked success. He also began to make his way toward\r\npublic life by his assiduous attendance and intelligent action in\r\nthe local assemblies. A new Diet was assembled in 1832, and he\r\nreceived a commission as the representative in the Diet of a magnate\r\nwho was absent. As proxy for an absentee he was only charged, by the\r\nHungarian Constitution, with a very subordinate part, his functions\r\nbeing more those of a counsel than of a delegate. This, however, was\r\na post much sought for by young and aspiring lawyers, as giving them\r\nan opportunity of mastering legal forms, displaying their abilities,\r\nand forming advantageous connections.\r\n\r\nThis Diet renewed the Liberal struggle with increased vigor. By far\r\nthe best talent of Hungary was ranged upon the Liberal side. Kossuth\r\nearly made himself known as a debater, and gradually won his way\r\nupward, and became associated with the leading men of the Liberal\r\nparty, many of whom were among the proudest and richest of the\r\nHungarian magnates. He soon undertook to publish a report of the\r\ndebates and proceedings of the Diet. This attempt was opposed by the\r\nPalatine, and a law hunted up which forbade the \"printing and\r\npublishing\" of these reports. He, for a while, evaded the law by\r\nhaving his sheet lithographed. It increased in its development of\r\ndemocratic tendencies, and in popularity, until finally the\r\nlithographic press was seized by Government. Kossuth, determined not\r\nto be baffled, still issued his journal, every copy being written\r\nout by scribes, of whom he employed a large number. To avoid seizure\r\nat the post-office, they were circulated through the local\r\nauthorities, who were almost invariably on the Liberal side. His\r\nperiodical penetrated into every part of the kingdom, and men saw\r\nwith wonder a young and almost unknown public writer boldly pitting\r\nhimself against Metternich and the whole Austrian cabinet. Kossuth\r\nmight well, at this period, declare that he \"felt within himself\r\nsomething nameless.\"\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding Diets the Opposition grew still more determined.\r\nKossuth, though twice admonished by Government, still continued his\r\njournal; and no longer confined himself to simple reports of the\r\nproceedings of the Diet, but added political remarks of the keenest\r\nsatire and most bitter denunciation. He was aware that his course\r\nwas a perilous one. He was once found by a friend walking in deep\r\nreverie in the fortress of Buda, and in reply to a question as to\r\nthe subject of his meditations, he said, \"I was looking at the\r\ncasemates, for I fear that I shall soon be quartered there.\"\r\nGovernment finally determined to use arguments more cogent than\r\ndiscussion could furnish. Baron Wesselenyi, the leader of the\r\nLiberal party, was arrested, together with a number of his\r\nadherents, among whom Kossuth was of too much note to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nKossuth became at once sanctified in the popular mind as a martyr.\r\nLiberal subscriptions were raised through the country for the\r\nbenefit of his mother and sisters, whom he had supported by his\r\nexertions, and who were now left without protection. Wesselenyi\r\nbecame blind in prison; Lovassi, an intimate friend of Kossuth, lost\r\nhis reason; and Kossuth himself, as was certified by his physicians,\r\nwas in imminent risk of falling a victim to a serious disease. The\r\nrigor of his confinement was mitigated; he was allowed books,\r\nnewspapers, and writing materials, and suffered to walk daily upon\r\nthe bastions of the fortress, in charge of an officer. Among those\r\nwho were inspired with admiration for his political efforts, and\r\nwith sympathy for his fate, was Teresa Mezlenyi, the young daughter\r\nof a nobleman. She sent him books, and corresponded with him during\r\nhis imprisonment; and they were married in 1841, soon after his\r\nliberation.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of Kossuth's imprisonment Austria again needed\r\nHungarian assistance. The threatening aspect of affairs in the East,\r\ngrowing out of the relations between Turkey and Egypt, determined\r\nall the great powers to increase their armaments. A demand was made\r\nupon the Hungarian Diet for an additional levy of 18,000 troops. A\r\nlarge body of delegates was chosen pledged to oppose this grant\r\nexcept upon condition of certain concessions, among which was a\r\ngeneral amnesty, with a special reference to the cases of Wesselenyi\r\nand Kossuth. The more sagacious of the Conservative party advised\r\nGovernment to liberate all the prisoners, with the exception of\r\nKossuth; and to do this before the meeting of the Diet, in order\r\nthat their liberation might not be made a condition of granting the\r\nlevy, which must be the occasion of great excitement. The cabinet\r\ntemporized and did nothing. The Diet was opened, and the contest was\r\nwaged during six months. The Opposition had a majority of two in the\r\nChamber of Deputies, but were in a meagre minority in the Chamber of\r\nMagnates. But Metternich and the cabinet grew alarmed at the\r\nstruggle, and were eager to obtain the grant of men, and to close\r\nthe refractory Diet. In 1840 a royal rescript suddenly made its\r\nappearance, granting the amnesty, accompanied also with conciliatory\r\nremarks, and the demands of the Government for men and money were at\r\nonce complied with.\r\n\r\nKossuth issued from prison, in 1840, bearing in his debilitated\r\nframe, his pallid face, and glassy eyes, traces of severe\r\nsufferings, both of mind and body. He repaired for a time to a\r\nwatering-place among the mountains to recruit his shattered health.\r\nHis imprisonment had done more for his influence than he could have\r\neffected if at liberty. The visitors at the watering-place treated\r\nwith silent respect the man who moved about among them in\r\ndressing-gown and slippers, and whose slow steps, and languid\r\nfeatures, disfigured with yellow spots, proclaimed him an invalid.\r\nAbundant subscriptions had been made for his benefit and that of his\r\nfamily, and he now stood on an equality with the proudest magnates.\r\nThese had so often used the name of the \"Martyr of the Liberty of\r\nthe Press,\" in pointing their speeches, that they now had no choice\r\nbut to accept the popular verdict as their own.\r\n\r\nSoon after his liberation, Kossuth came forward as the principal\r\neditor of the _Pesth Gazette_ (_Pesthi Hirlap_), which a bookseller\r\nwho enjoyed the protection of the Government had received permission\r\nto establish. The name of the editor was now sufficient to electrify\r\nthe country; and Kossuth at once stood forth as the advocate of the\r\nrights of the lower and middle classes against the inordinate\r\nprivileges and immunities enjoyed by the magnates. But when he went\r\nto the extent of demanding that the house-tax should be paid by all\r\nclasses in the community, not even excepting the highest nobility, a\r\nparty was raised up against him among the nobles, who established a\r\npaper to combat so disorganizing a doctrine. This party, backed by\r\nthe influence of the Government, succeeded in defeating the election\r\nof Kossuth as member from Pesth for the Diet of 1843. He was,\r\nhowever, very active in the local assembly of the capital.\r\n\r\nKossuth was not altogether without support among the higher nobles.\r\nThe blind old Wesselenyi traversed the country, advocating rural\r\nfreedom and the abolition of the urbarial burdens. Among his\r\nsupporters at this period, also, was Count Louis Batthyanyi, one of\r\nthe most considerable of the Magyar magnates, subsequently President\r\nof the Hungarian Ministry, and the most illustrious martyr of the\r\nHungarian cause. Aided by his powerful support, Kossuth was again\r\nbrought forward, in 1847, as one of the two candidates from Pesth.\r\nThe Government party, aware that they were in a decided minority,\r\nlimited their efforts to an attempt to defeat the election of\r\nKossuth. This they endeavored to effect by stratagem, but failed\r\nutterly.\r\n\r\nKossuth no sooner took his seat in the Diet than the foremost place\r\nwas at once conceded to him. At the opening of the session he moved\r\nan address to the king, concluding with the petition that \"liberal\r\ninstitutions, similar to those of the Hungarian Constitution, might\r\nbe accorded to all the hereditary states, that thus might be created\r\na united Austrian monarchy, based upon broad and constitutional\r\nprinciples.\" During the early months of the session Kossuth showed\r\nhimself a most accomplished parliamentary orator and debater; and\r\ncarried on a series of attacks upon the policy of the Austrian\r\ncabinet, which for skill and power have few parallels in the annals\r\nof parliamentary warfare. Those form a very inadequate conception of\r\nits scope and power, whose ideas of the eloquence of Kossuth are\r\nderived solely from the impassioned and exclamatory harangues which\r\nhe flung out during the war. These were addressed to men wrought up\r\nto the utmost tension, and can be judged fairly only by men in a\r\nstate of high excitement. He adapted his matter and manner to the\r\noccasion and the audience. Some of his speeches are marked by a\r\nstringency of logic worthy of Webster or Calhoun; but it was what\r\nall eloquence of a high order must ever be--\"logic red-hot.\"\r\n\r\nNow came the French Revolution of February, 1848. The news of it\r\nreached Vienna on March 1st, and was received at Presburg on the 2d.\r\nOn the following day Kossuth delivered his famous speech on the\r\nfinances and the state of the monarchy generally, concluding with a\r\nproposed \"Address to the Throne,\" urging a series of reformatory\r\nmeasures. Among the foremost of these was the emancipation of the\r\ncountry from feudal burdens--the proprietors of the soil to be\r\nindemnified by the state; equalizing taxation; a faithful\r\nadministration of the revenue to be satisfactorily guaranteed; the\r\nfurther development of the representative system; and the\r\nestablishment of a government representing the voice of, and\r\nresponsible to, the nation. The speech produced an effect almost\r\nwithout parallel in the annals of debate. Not a word was uttered in\r\nreply, and the motion was unanimously carried. On March 13th took\r\nplace the revolution in Vienna which overthrew the Metternich cabinet.\r\nOn the 15th the constitution granted by the emperor to all the nations\r\nwithin the empire was solemnly proclaimed amid the wildest transports\r\nof joy. Henceforth there were to be no more Germans or Sclavonians,\r\nMagyars or Italians; strangers embraced and kissed each other in the\r\nstreets, for all the heterogeneous races of the empire were now\r\nbrothers: as likewise were all the nations of the earth at Anacharsis\r\nKlootz's \"Feast of Pikes\" in Paris on that 14th day of July in the\r\nyear of grace 1790--and yet, notwithstanding, came the \"Reign of\r\nTerror.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the demands made by the Hungarian Diet was that of a separate\r\nand responsible ministry for Hungary. The Palatine, Archduke\r\nStephen, to whom the conduct of affairs in Hungary had been\r\nintrusted, persuaded the emperor to accede to this demand, and on\r\nthe following day Batthyanyi, who, with Kossuth and a deputation of\r\ndelegates of the Diet was in Vienna, was named President of the\r\nHungarian ministry. It was, however, understood that Kossuth was the\r\nlife and soul of the new ministry.\r\n\r\nKossuth assumed the Department of Finance, then, as long before and\r\nnow, the post of difficulty under Austrian administration. The Diet,\r\nmeanwhile, went on to consummate the series of reforms which Kossuth\r\nhad so long and steadfastly advocated.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there had been, indeed, a vigorous and decided\r\nopposition, but no insurrection. The true cause of the Hungarian war\r\nwas the hostility of the Austrian Government to the whole series of\r\nreformatory measures which had been effected through the\r\ninstrumentality of Kossuth; but its immediate occasion was the\r\njealousy which sprung up among the Servian and Croatian dependencies\r\nof Hungary against the Hungarian ministry. This soon broke out into\r\nan open revolt, headed by Baron Jellachich, who had just been\r\nappointed Ban, or Lord, of Croatia. How far the Serbs and Croats had\r\noccasion for jealousy is of little consequence to our present\r\npurpose to inquire; though we may say, in passing, that the\r\nproceedings of the Magyars toward the other Hungarian races was\r\nmarked by a far more just and generous feeling and conduct than\r\ncould have been possibly expected. But however the case may have\r\nbeen, as between the Magyars and Croats, as between the Hungarians\r\nand Austria, the hostile course of the latter is without excuse or\r\npalliation. The emperor had solemnly sanctioned the action of the\r\nDiet, and did as solemnly denounce the proceedings of Jellachich. On\r\nMay 29th the Ban was summoned to present himself at Innsprück to\r\nanswer for his conduct, and as he did not make his appearance, an\r\nimperial manifesto was issued on June 10th depriving him of all his\r\ndignities, and commanding the authorities at once to break off all\r\nintercourse with him. He, however, still continued his operations,\r\nand levied an army for the invasion of Hungary, and a fierce and\r\nbloody war of races broke out, marked on both sides by the most\r\nfearful atrocities.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian Diet was opened on July 5th, when the Palatine,\r\nArchduke Stephen, in the name of the king, solemnly denounced the\r\nconduct of the insurgent Croats. A few days after, Kossuth, in a\r\nspeech in the Diet, set forth the perilous state of affairs, and\r\nconcluded by asking for authority to raise an army of 200,000 men,\r\nand a large amount of money. These proposals were adopted by\r\nacclamation, the enthusiasm in the Diet rendering any debate\r\nimpossible and superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial forces having been victorious in Italy, and one\r\npressing danger being thus averted from the empire, the Austrian\r\ncabinet began openly to display its hostility to the Hungarian\r\nmovement. Jellachich repaired to Innsprück, and was openly\r\nacknowledged by the court, and the decree of deposition was revoked.\r\nEarly in September Hungary and Austria stood in an attitude of\r\nundisguised hostility. On the 5th of that month Kossuth, though\r\nenfeebled by illness, was carried to the hall of the Diet, where he\r\ndelivered a speech, declaring that so formidable were the dangers\r\nthat surrounded the nation, that the ministers might soon be forced\r\nto call upon the Diet to name a dictator, clothed with unlimited\r\npowers, to save the country; but before taking this final step they\r\nwould recommend a last appeal to the Imperial Government. A large\r\ndeputation was thereupon despatched to the emperor, to lay before\r\nhim the demands of the Hungarian nation. No satisfactory answer was\r\nreturned, and the deputation left the imperial presence in silence.\r\nOn their return they plucked from their caps the plumes of the\r\nunited colors of Austria and Hungary, and replaced them with red\r\nfeathers, and hoisted a flag of the same color on the steamer which\r\nconveyed them to Pesth. Their report produced the most intense\r\nagitation in the Diet and at the capital, but it was finally\r\nresolved to make one more attempt for a pacific settlement of the\r\nquestion. In order that no obstacle might be interposed by their\r\npresence, Kossuth and his colleagues resigned, and a new ministry\r\nwas appointed. A deputation was sent to the National Assembly at\r\nVienna, which refused to receive it. Jellachich had in the meantime\r\nentered Hungary with a large army, not as yet, however, openly\r\nsanctioned by imperial authority. The Diet, seeing the imminent\r\nperil of the country, conferred dictatorial powers upon Kossuth. The\r\nPalatine resigned his post and left the kingdom. The emperor\r\nappointed Count Lemberg to take the entire command of the Hungarian\r\narmy. The Diet declared the appointment illegal, and the count,\r\narriving at Pesth without escort, was slain in the streets of the\r\ncapital by the populace, in a sudden outbreak. The emperor forthwith\r\nplaced the kingdom under martial law, giving the supreme civil and\r\nmilitary power to Jellachich. The Diet at once revolted, declared\r\nitself permanent, and appointed Kossuth Governor, and President of\r\nthe Committee of Safety.\r\n\r\nThere was now but one course left for the Hungarians: to maintain by\r\nforce of arms the position they had assumed. We cannot detail the\r\nevents of the war which followed, but merely touch upon the most\r\nsalient points. Jellachich was speedily driven out of Hungary toward\r\nVienna. In October the Austrian forces were concentrated, under\r\ncommand of Windischgrätz, to the number of 120,000 veterans, and\r\nwere put on the march for Hungary. To oppose them the only forces\r\nunder the command of the new government of Hungary were 20,000\r\nregular infantry, 7,000 cavalry, and 14,000 recruits, who received\r\nthe name of Honveds, or \"protectors of home.\" Of all the movements\r\nthat followed, Kossuth was the soul and chief. His burning and\r\npassionate appeals stirred up the souls of the peasants, and sent\r\nthem by thousands to the camp. He kindled enthusiasm, he organized\r\nthat enthusiasm, and transformed those raw recruits into soldiers\r\nmore than a match for the veteran troops of Austria. Though himself\r\nnot a soldier, he discovered and drew about him soldiers and\r\ngenerals of a high order. The result was that Windischgrätz was\r\ndriven back from Hungary, and of the 120,000 troops which he led\r\ninto that kingdom in October, one-half were killed, disabled, or\r\ntaken prisoners at the end of April. The state of the war on May 1st\r\nmay be gathered from the imperial manifesto of that date, which\r\nannounced that \"the insurrection in Hungary had grown to such an\r\nextent\" that the Imperial Government \"had been induced to appeal to\r\nthe assistance of his majesty the Czar of all the Russias, who\r\ngenerously and readily granted it to a most satisfactory extent.\"\r\nThe issue of the contest could no longer be doubtful when the\r\nimmense weight of Russia was thrown into the scale. In modern\r\nwarfare there is a limit beyond which devotion and enthusiasm cannot\r\nsupply the place of numbers and material force. And that limit was\r\noverpassed when Russia and Austria were pitted against Hungary.\r\n\r\nOn May 1st the Russian intervention was announced. On August 11th\r\nKossuth resigned his dictatorship into the hands of Görgey, who, two\r\ndays after, in effect closed the war by surrendering to the\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian war thus lasted a little more than eleven months,\r\nduring which time there was but one ruling and directing spirit, and\r\nthat was Kossuth, to whose immediate career we now return.\r\n\r\nNothing remained for him and his companions but flight. They gained\r\nthe Turkish frontier, and threw themselves on the hospitality of the\r\nsultan, who promised them a safe asylum. Russia and Austria demanded\r\nthat the fugitives should be given up; but being supported by France\r\nand England, the sultan arranged a compromise by which they were\r\ndetained in Asia Minor as prisoners. Kossuth was released in 1851,\r\nand made a tour of the United States, agitating in favor of Hungary.\r\nHe never returned to his native land, but lived an exile for over\r\nforty years. For a while he struggled desperately to help the\r\nHungarians; then, finding that the universal progress of liberal\r\nideas was doing more for them than he ever could, he resigned\r\nhimself to a peaceful life devoted to literature and science. He\r\ndied at Turin, March 20, 1894, reverenced by all the world, and\r\nmourned by his countrymen with tumultuous demonstrations as their\r\nnational hero.\r\n\r\nKossuth occupies a position peculiarly his own, whether we regard\r\nthe circumstances of his rise, or the feelings which have followed\r\nhim in his fall. Born in the middle ranks of life, he raised himself\r\nby sheer force of intellect to the loftiest place among the proudest\r\nnobles on earth, without ever deserting or being deserted by the\r\nclass from which he sprung. He effected a sweeping reform without\r\nappealing to any sordid or sanguinary motive. No soldier himself, he\r\ntransformed a country into a camp, and a nation into an army. He\r\ntransmuted his words into batteries, and his thoughts into soldiers.\r\nWithout ever having looked upon a stricken field, he organized the\r\nmost complete system of resistance to despotism that the history of\r\nrevolutions has furnished. It failed, but only failed where nothing\r\ncould have succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ERICSSON[13]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 13: Reprinted, by permission, from the Magazine of\r\n         American History.]\r\n\r\nBy MARTHA J. LAMB\r\n\r\n(1803-1889)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Ericsson.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a message, referring to the relations of our country with the\r\nseveral nations of Europe, President Harrison said: \"The restoration\r\nof the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a gratifying\r\noccasion to honor the memory of the great inventor, to whose genius\r\nour country owes so much, and to bear witness to the unbroken\r\nfriendship which has existed between the land which bore him and our\r\nown, which claimed him as a citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThis paragraph is a forcible reminder of the impressive ceremonial\r\nwitnessed in the streets and harbor of New York City, on Saturday,\r\nAugust 23, 1890. It had been intimated to this Government, as is\r\nwell known, that the Government of Sweden would regard it as a\r\ngraceful act if the remains of Captain John Ericsson should be\r\nconveyed to his native country upon a United States man-of-war; and\r\narrangements having been completed, the Baltimore was assigned to\r\nthe service. In committing the illustrious dead to the care of the\r\ncommander of the Baltimore, Mr. George H. Robinson said: \"We send\r\nhim back crowned with honor, proud of the life of fifty years he\r\ndevoted to this nation, and with gratitude for his gifts to us.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ericsson's birthplace in Sweden is marked by a large granite\r\nmonument erected in 1867. His father was a mining proprietor, and\r\nhis mother an energetic, intellectual, and high-spirited woman. His\r\nbrother, Nils, one year older than himself, was trained as an\r\nengineer, became chief of the construction of the system of\r\ngovernment railways in Sweden, was created a baron, and retired in\r\n1862 with a pension larger than any before bestowed upon a Swedish\r\nsubject. His sister Caroline, born in 1800, was a girl of unusual\r\nbeauty. As a boy John was the wonder of the neighborhood. The\r\nmachinery at the mines was to him an endless source of curiosity and\r\ndelight. He was constantly trying to make models, even before he had\r\nlearned to read. He had from his own plans constructed a miniature\r\nsaw-mill prior to his tenth birthday, and made numerous drawings of\r\na complicated character. The graphic account of his youth and early\r\nmanhood which his biographer presents is full of suggestion and\r\ninstruction. The boy was too much occupied with his contrivances to\r\njoin in the pastimes of other children. His opportunities were\r\nunusually stimulating. The project of the Göta Canal Company, one of\r\nthe most formidable undertakings of its kind, was revived when he\r\nwas about ten years old, his father being appointed one of its\r\nengineers, holding place next to that of the chief of the work. This\r\nopened a new world of ideas, and the little fellow undertook all\r\nmanner of schemes. He was independent of outside assistance. Steel\r\ntweezers, borrowed from his mother's dressing-case and ground to a\r\npoint, furnished him with a drawing pen, and his compasses were made\r\nof birch-wood with needles inserted at the end of the legs. Later\r\non, he robbed his mother's sable cloak of the hairs required for two\r\nsmall brushes, in order to complete his drawings in appropriate\r\ncolors. The clever lad attracted the notice of some of the greatest\r\nmechanical draughtsmen in Sweden, who made him drawings to serve as\r\nmodels, and taught him many of the principles of the art. Finally\r\nthe celebrated engineer, Count Platen, becoming interested,\r\nappointed him a cadet in the corps of mechanical engineers; and such\r\nwas his progress in sketching profiles, maps, and drawings for the\r\narchives of the canal company, that in 1816, at the age of thirteen,\r\nhe was made assistant leveller at the station of Riddarhagen. The\r\nnext year he was employed to set out the work for six hundred\r\noperatives, though he was yet too small to reach the eye-piece of\r\nhis levelling instrument without the aid of a stool carried by an\r\nattendant. Thus it will be seen that he was identified almost from\r\nhis cradle with great engineering works. His father died in 1818,\r\nand in 1820, when seventeen, he entered the Swedish army as an\r\nensign and was rapidly promoted to a lieutenancy.\r\n\r\nThe skill of young Ericsson in topographical drawing was so marked\r\nthat he was soon summoned to the royal palace to draw maps to\r\nillustrate the campaigns of the marshal of the empire. He also\r\npassed with distinction a competitive examination for an appointment\r\non the survey of Northern Sweden. This new employment was exacting,\r\nand the pay determined by the amount of work accomplished. Mr.\r\nChurch says: \"The young surveyor from the Göta Canal was so\r\nindefatigable in his industry and so rapid in execution, that he\r\nperformed double duty and was carried on the pay-roll as two persons\r\nin order to avoid criticism and charges of favoritism. The results\r\nof his labors were maps of fifty square miles of territory, still\r\npreserved in the archives of Stockholm.\"\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-one John Ericsson is described as \"a handsome,\r\ndashing youth, with a cluster of thick, brown, glossy curls\r\nencircling his white, massive forehead. His mouth was delicate but\r\nfirm, nose straight, eyes light blue, clear and bright, with a\r\nslight expression of sadness, his complexion brilliant with the\r\nfreshness and glow of healthy youth. The broad shoulders carried\r\nmost splendidly the proud, erect head. He presented, in short, the\r\nvery picture of vigorous manhood. A portrait of him at this age,\r\npainted upon ivory for his mother by an English artist named Way,\r\nhas been preserved.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen years later he was in New York, and is thus described by\r\nSamuel Risley: \"Captain Ericsson all his life was careful of his\r\npersonal appearance; at the time I refer to (1839) he was\r\nexceptional in dress, not dandified, but more in keeping with the\r\npresent morning-call attire than an ordinary day habit. A\r\nclose-fitting black frock surtout coat, well open at the front, with\r\nrolling collar, showing velvet vest and a good display of\r\nshirt-front; a fine gold chain hung about his neck, looped at the\r\nfirst button-hole of the vest and attached to a watch carried in the\r\nfob of the vest. Usually light-colored, well-fitting trousers,\r\nlight-colored kid gloves, and a beaver hat completed the dress. To\r\nthis add a well-built military figure, about five feet ten and\r\none-half inches in height and well set-up, with broad shoulders and\r\nrather large hands and feet; the head well placed and supported by a\r\nmilitary stock round the neck. Expressive features, blue eyes, and\r\nbrown curly hair, fair complexion. His head was of medium size, his\r\nmouth well cut, upper lip a little drawn, the jaws large and firm\r\nset, conveying an expression of firmness and individual character.\r\nUp to the summer of 1842 I was in constant attendance upon the\r\ncaptain, being a sort of factotum to him in preparing his models. At\r\nthat time he boarded at the Astor House, where I first met his wife.\r\nHis manner with strangers was courteous and extremely taking. He\r\ninvariably made friends of high and low alike. With those in\r\nimmediate contact in carrying out his work he was very popular.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Church, in his biography, devotes three chapters to a\r\ndelightfully condensed account of Ericsson's career in England,\r\nwhither he went in 1826 to exhibit his flame-engine. He quickly\r\nformed a partnership with John Braithwaite, a working engineer, and\r\nin his new field of activity produced invention after invention in\r\nsuch rapid succession that the truth reads like a fairy tale. An\r\ninstrument for taking sea-soundings, a hydrostatic weighing-machine,\r\nhis improvements in the steam-engine--dispensing with huge\r\nsmoke-stacks, economizing fuel, using compressed air and the\r\nartificial draught--and in surface condensation, were the work of\r\nthis period, during which he also invented the steam fire-engine,\r\nwhich excited great interest in London. The famous battle of the\r\nlocomotives in 1829 brought the young man of twenty-six before the\r\nEnglish public in a manner never to be forgotten. At that date\r\nStephenson himself dared not say very much about the speed of the\r\nlocomotive. Had he ventured to predict that it would reach twenty\r\nmiles an hour on the railway, he would have been laughed out of\r\ncourt. He cautiously expressed his faith in the possibility of\r\nrunning it ten miles an hour, and multitudes regarded the experiment\r\nwith consternation. There was great prejudice then existing in\r\nEngland against railroads. It was a mode of conveyance that would\r\nbring noble and peasant to a common level, and fashion clung\r\ntenaciously to its earlier inconveniences, which had at least the\r\nmerit of being exclusive.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the baleful prophecies concerning the locomotive\r\nengine, the officials of the projected railroad between Liverpool\r\nand Manchester, where the cars were expected to be drawn by horses,\r\noffered a premium of £500 for the best locomotive capable of drawing\r\na gross weight of twenty tons at the rate of ten miles an hour. The\r\nconditions required a run of seventy miles. Five months were allowed\r\nfor building the engines. Ericsson heard of the project only seven\r\nweeks before the appointed time of trial, and at once determined to\r\ncompete. He hastily built the \"Novelty,\" assisted by Braithwaite,\r\nand when the exhibition came off his was practically the only\r\nlocomotive which disputed for the supremacy with Stephenson's\r\n\"Rocket.\" But a portion of the railroad had yet been finished; thus\r\nthe competing locomotives were compelled to cover their distance by\r\nmaking twenty trips back and forth over one and three-quarter miles\r\nof track. The excitement was intense. The London _Times_ next\r\nmorning said: \"The 'Novelty' was the lightest and most elegant\r\ncarriage on the road yesterday, and the velocity with which it moved\r\nsurprised and amazed every beholder. It shot along the line at the\r\namazing rate of thirty miles an hour! It seemed, indeed, to fly;\r\npresenting one of the most sublime spectacles of human ingenuity and\r\nhuman daring the world ever beheld.\"\r\n\r\nEricsson had really built a much faster locomotive than Stephenson's\r\n\"Rocket;\" and although it had been constructed with such celerity\r\nthat it broke down before the final point was reached, and he\r\nthereby lost the prize, yet the superiority of the principle\r\ninvolved in it was universally recognized. John Bourn said: \"To most\r\nmen the production of such an engine would have constituted an\r\nadequate claim to celebrity. In the case of Ericsson, it is only a\r\nsingle star of the brilliant galaxy with which his shield is\r\nspangled.\" \"We may imagine,\" writes Mr. Church, \"the excitement\r\nfollowing the announcement in the _Times_ concerning the performance\r\nof the 'Novelty,' for to this engine England's great daily devoted\r\nchief attention.\" Railroad shares leaped at once to a premium, and\r\nexcited groups gathered on 'change to discuss the wonderful event.\r\nThe pessimists were silenced, and the art of modern railway travel\r\ninaugurated. A grand banquet was given in Liverpool to the directors\r\nand officers of the railway and to the competing locomotive\r\nbuilders. Toasts and speeches followed; and if Ericsson did not\r\ncarry home with him the £500 offered as a prize, he at least made\r\nhimself known to all England as one of the rising men of his\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nEricsson's long-cherished plan of a caloric engine was realized in\r\n1833, and was hailed with astonishment by the scientific world of\r\nLondon. Lectures were delivered on it by Dr. Dionysius Lardner and\r\nMichael Faraday, and it was much praised by Dr. Alexander Ure and\r\nSir Richard Phillips. In 1836 Ericsson invented and patented the\r\nscrew propeller, which revolutionized navigation, and in 1837 built\r\na steam vessel having twin screw propellers, which on trial towed\r\nthe American packet-ship Toronto at the rate of five miles an hour\r\non the river Thames. In 1838 he constructed the iron screw steamer\r\nRobert F. Stockton, which crossed the Atlantic under canvas in 1839,\r\nand was afterward employed as a tug-boat on the Delaware River for a\r\nquarter of a century. Within ten years Ericsson patented thirty\r\ninventions considered by him of sufficient importance to claim a\r\nplace in the list that in 1863 numbered one hundred.\r\n\r\nA notable feature of the admirable work of Mr. Church is the\r\nelucidation of the truth, so often overlooked, that events never\r\nspring into being disjoined from antecedents leading to them. He\r\nexplains how the varied achievements of John Ericsson were\r\ndeveloped, showing with great force and in imperishable colors the\r\nsteps to his successes, and the help the famous engineer derived in\r\nlater life from the studies and experiments of his earlier career.\r\nMr. Church, as the literary executor of Ericsson, has had unrivalled\r\nopportunities for examining the accumulation of data which throw\r\nlight all along the way, and while dealing with the masterly\r\nengineering exploits of his subject, does not forget that he had a\r\nhuman side, and presents him with all his hopes and fears and\r\nfailures, his aims, his obstacles, his courage, and his habits and\r\neccentricities. Ericsson certainly cherished a very high ideal, and\r\nwas free to an unusual extent from mercenary motives. His inventions\r\ndid not always pay; he found this a weary world for those who see\r\nbeyond their fellows. Some of his mechanical contrivances in common\r\nuse to-day dated so far back of the memory of any one living that\r\nbefore he died he often learned that he was supposed to have copied\r\nfrom others what he, in fact, originated himself or first brought\r\ninto use.\r\n\r\nThe barriers of tradition and prejudice had to be overcome with his\r\nevery new invention. The introduction of steam in any shape to the\r\nEnglish navy was sharply opposed. It is interesting to trace the\r\nincidents, apparently without connection, which stand in orderly\r\nrelations one to another as essential parts of an intelligent\r\ndesign. Ericsson was in America at the critical moment when all the\r\nexperiences of his previous life were to be brought into full play;\r\nwhen he was to take part in an enterprise involving the existence of\r\na nation, the hopes of humanity. He was ready to meet the strain of\r\na demand to which no other living man was adequate. He was then\r\nfifty-eight years of age, with the constitution and the vital forces\r\nof a man of forty, and such experience in actual accomplishment as\r\nfew acquire in the longest span of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nWhen he received the order of our Government for the Monitor his\r\nplans were already drawn. He had been at work for years perfecting\r\nhis system of aquatic attack, originally designed for the protection\r\nof Sweden against foreign aggression, and had in 1854 submitted his\r\ndrawings to the Emperor of France. The story of his proceedings in\r\nWashington is familiar to our readers, but in these notable volumes\r\nof Mr. Church it is told with a fulness of detail never before\r\nattempted. The Monitor in all its parts was designed by Ericsson,\r\nand, fortunately for the country, he was allowed to superintend its\r\nconstruction. His former plans, however, had to be carefully revised\r\nto meet the novel conditions of life in a submerged structure. It\r\nwas estimated that this iron-clad vessel contained at least forty\r\npatentable contrivances. The entire resources of modern engineering\r\nknowledge were brought to bear upon the solution of the problem of\r\nan impregnable battery, armed with guns of the heaviest calibre then\r\nknown, hull shot-proof from stern to stern, rudder and propeller\r\nprotected against the enemy's fire, and above all, having the\r\nadvantage of light draught. Ericsson was made responsible for the\r\nsuccessful working of his vessel in every respect. The anxiety of\r\nthe Government was such that every stage in the progress of the work\r\ntoward completion was watched with restless interest. Ericsson's\r\nnerves and sinews seemed to be made of steel. He scarcely took time\r\nto eat or sleep, and he was deluged with a continuous tempest of\r\ncriticism, warning, and advice, from those who knew nothing about\r\nthe intricacies of science involved in the undertaking. The least\r\nhalting, even trifling delay, confusion of mind, or weakness of\r\nbody, and the story of Hampton Roads might not have been written.\r\n\r\nThe Monitor was finished and left the harbor of New York for\r\nWashington on the afternoon of March 6, 1862, in tow of a tug, and\r\naccompanied by two naval steamers. Chief Engineer Alban S. Stimers,\r\nU. S. N., who was on the vessel as a passenger, described in a\r\nletter, dated March 9, 1862, to Ericsson, the dramatic incidents\r\nattending its arrival at Hampton Roads. \"After a stormy passage we\r\nfought the Merrimac for more than three hours this forenoon, and\r\nsent her back to Norfolk in a sinking condition. Iron-clad against\r\niron-clad, we manoeuvred about the bay here, and went at each other\r\nwith mutual fairness. I consider that both ships were well fought.\r\nWe were struck twenty-two times--pilot-house twice, turret nine\r\ntimes, deck three times, sides eight times. The only vulnerable\r\npoint was the pilot-house. One of your great logs (nine by twelve\r\ninches thick) is broken in two. The shot struck just outside of\r\nwhere the captain had his eye, and disabled him by destroying his\r\nleft eye and temporarily blinding the other. She tried to run us\r\ndown and sink us as she did the Cumberland yesterday, but she got\r\nthe worst of it. Her horn passed over our deck, and our sharp,\r\nupper-edged rail cut through the light iron shoe upon her stern and\r\nwell into her oak. She will not try that again. She gave us a\r\ntremendous thump, but did not injure us in the least; we were just\r\nable to find the point of contact. The turret is a splendid\r\nstructure. You were very correct in your estimate of the effect of\r\nshot upon the man on the inside of the turret, when it struck near\r\nhim. Three men were knocked down, of whom I was one. The other two\r\nhad to be carried below, but I was not disabled at all, and the\r\nothers recovered before the battle was over. Captain Worden\r\n(afterward admiral) stationed himself at the pilot-house. Greene\r\nfired the guns, and I turned the turret until the captain was\r\ndisabled and was relieved by Greene, when I managed the turret\r\nmyself, Master Stoddard having been one of the two stunned men.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Ericsson, I congratulate you upon your great success;\r\nthousands here this day bless you. I have heard whole crews cheer\r\nyou; every man feels that you have saved the nation by furnishing us\r\nwith the means to whip an iron-clad frigate that was, until our\r\narrival, having it all her own way with our most powerful vessels.\"\r\n\r\nIf space permitted, it would be interesting to trace the career of\r\nEricsson in detail after the success of the Monitor. There was an\r\nimperative demand for armor-clads, and ere long several were built\r\nby the inventor and his associates. Ericsson was never idle. In\r\nconnection with his labors upon war vessels he expended no small\r\namount of ingenuity on the improvement of heavy guns, his efforts in\r\nthis field being directed by a most exhaustive study into the\r\nstrength of materials, the operation of explosive forces, and the\r\nlaws governing the flight of projectiles. In 1869 he constructed for\r\nthe Spanish Government a fleet of thirty steam gunboats, intended to\r\nguard Cuba against filibustering parties. In 1881 he devised his\r\nlatest war vessel, the Destroyer, the object of which he said was\r\n\"simply to demonstrate the practicability of submarine artillery,\r\nunquestionably the most effective, as well as the cheapest, device\r\nfor protecting the sea-ports of the Union against iron-clad ships. I\r\ndo not,\" he continued, \"seek emoluments, as I am financially\r\nindependent; but I am anxious to benefit the great and liberal\r\ncountry which has enabled me to carry out important works which I\r\nshould not have carried out on a monarchical soil.\" His\r\ninvestigations included computations of the influences which retard\r\nthe earth's rotary motion; he erected a \"sun motor\" in 1883, to\r\ndevelop the power obtained from the supply of mechanical energy in\r\nthe sun, and he contributed numerous valuable papers to various\r\njournals in America and Europe on scientific, naval, and mechanical\r\nthemes.\r\n\r\nThe year in which John Ericsson reached the culmination of his fame,\r\n1862, was the same in which his brother Nils retired from active\r\nlife in Sweden. The latter had retained his position on the Göta\r\nCanal when his brother left it in 1820, and gradually won his way to\r\nfame and fortune. \"He was a man of industry and energy, of sterling\r\nintegrity and public spirit, and an excellent organizer; while his\r\nconservative and cautious temperament and his skill in bending\r\nothers to his purposes enabled him to make the most of his\r\nopportunities.\" After he received his title he altered the spelling\r\nof his name and became Baron Ericson. This change gave great offence\r\nto John, who wrote to Nils: \"I can never forget the unpleasantness\r\ncaused me by this annulling of relationship. Possibly your wife has\r\nhad her share in it. If so, she will find some day that the\r\nblotted-out letter will cost her children half a million.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting chapters in the work of Mr. Church\r\nrelate to the personal characteristics of John Ericsson. He was\r\ngenerous to his friends, and his benefactions to Sweden were\r\nconsiderable. The financial side of his affairs from year to year\r\nappears, as well as the record of his failures and successes. It is\r\ndifficult to grasp the whole man and present him to the reader in\r\nall his many-sided aspects, or to touch upon the variety of his\r\nstudies, endeavors, schemes, and achievements, without danger of\r\nbewilderment. His biographer has done all this, however, in the most\r\nskilful and acceptable manner.\r\n\r\nA list of the honors conferred upon Ericsson would fill one of our\r\npages, and some of the medals received were very beautiful. He was\r\ndecorated as Knight of the Order of Vasa, which was founded by\r\nGustavus III. to reward important service to the nation; he was made\r\nKnight Commander of the Order of the North Star, for promoting the\r\npublic good and useful institutions; a Commander of the Order of St.\r\nOlaf, to reward distinction in the arts and sciences; received the\r\nGrand Cross of the Order of Naval Merit, with the white badge and\r\nstar, from King Alfonso of Spain, which confers personal nobility\r\nand bestowed upon Ericsson the title of \"Excellency;\" a special gold\r\nmedal from the Emperor of Austria, in behalf of science; a gold\r\nmedal from the Society of Iron-Masters in Sweden; thanks under the\r\nroyal seal and signature from Sweden; joint resolutions of thanks\r\nfrom the United States Congress; thanks from the Legislatures of New\r\nYork and of other States; from the Chamber of Commerce; from boards\r\nof trade in many cities; and he was elected to honorary membership\r\nin scientific, historical, literary, religious, and agricultural\r\ninstitutions innumerable. Among them all he took the most pride in\r\nhis simple title of captain, and in the diploma of LL. D. received\r\nfrom the Wesleyan University in 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON[14]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 14: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON\r\n\r\n(1805-1879)\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, whose name is indissolubly connected with the\r\nabolition of American slavery, was born in the seaport town of\r\nNewburyport, Mass., on December 10, 1805. His father, Abijah Garrison,\r\nwas a sea-captain who came from New Brunswick to settle in\r\nNewburyport. Deserting his wife and children while the subject of this\r\nsketch was in infancy, his subsequent career is shrouded in mystery.\r\nFanny Lloyd, the mother of William Lloyd Garrison, was a woman of\r\nremarkable character and personal attraction, with an intense\r\nreligious nature. Dependent upon her own efforts for the support of\r\nthe family, she cheerfully took up the calling of monthly nurse, and\r\nendeavored to rear her children with care and forethought, and with\r\nespecial attention to their religious training. Upon her removal to\r\nLynn, in 1812, Lloyd was left to the care of Deacon Ezekiel Bartlett\r\nand was sent to the Grammar School until, at the age of nine, he\r\njoined his mother in Lynn and was taught shoemaking in the shop of\r\nGamaliel W. Oliver, a kind and excellent member of the Society of\r\nFriends, where his elder brother James was already an apprentice. In\r\n1815, Mr. Paul Newhall, a shoe manufacturer of the same town, deciding\r\nto establish business in Baltimore, invited Mrs. Garrison and her two\r\nboys to accompany him. There Lloyd was employed as an errand-boy and\r\nJames was again apprenticed at shoemaking. Mr. Newhall's venture\r\nproving unsuccessful, Mrs. Garrison was constrained to resume nursing\r\nand Lloyd was sent back to Newburyport, his brother betaking himself\r\nto the sea. From Newburyport he was sent to Haverhill to learn\r\ncabinet-making; but, in spite of kind treatment, he disliked the\r\noccupation and ran away from his master, returning to Newburyport to\r\nlive again with his mother's old friend, Deacon Bartlett. In 1818,\r\nEphraim W. Allen, proprietor of the Newburyport _Herald_, accepted\r\nLloyd, then thirteen years of age, as an apprentice and taught him the\r\nprinter's trade. Here at once he found a vocation suited to his tastes\r\nand became a rapid and accurate compositor. The printing-office proved\r\nan excellent school for the young man, developing his literary taste\r\nand ambition. He was fond of reading, and delighted in poetry and\r\nfiction. Politics especially attracted him, and at the age of sixteen\r\nhe wrote anonymous articles for the columns of the _Herald_. His first\r\ncontribution was over the signature of \"An Old Bachelor.\" He was an\r\nardent Federalist and his political articles attracted attention by\r\ntheir forcible reasoning and direct style. Caleb Cushing, then editor\r\nof the _Herald_, discovering the lad's abilities, encouraged and\r\nbefriended him. In 1826, Mr. Garrison, closing his apprenticeship with\r\nthe _Herald_, became editor and publisher of the _Free Press_\r\n(Newburyport), within a few months of his majority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Lloyd Garrison.]\r\n\r\nIt was to this paper that Whittier made his first poetical\r\ncontributions anonymously, and, upon the discovery of his true name,\r\nMr. Garrison sought him out and encouraged him in his youthful\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief existence of six months, the _Free Press_ was sold and\r\nMr. Garrison again became a journeyman printer, soon seeking\r\nemployment in Boston, where, after various vicissitudes, he was\r\nemployed by Rev. William Collier, a Baptist city missionary, upon\r\n_The National Philanthropist_, devoted to the \"suppression of\r\nintemperance and kindred vices,\" becoming its editor in 1828. The\r\npaper had the distinction of being the first temperance journal ever\r\nprinted, and among the earliest evidences of Mr. Garrison's interest\r\nin the slavery question was an editorial article by him commenting\r\nseverely on the bill passed by the House of Assembly of South\r\nCarolina to forbid the teaching of reading and writing to the\r\ncolored people.\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker, and at that time editor of the _Genius\r\nof Universal Emancipation_, in Baltimore--a paper devoted to the\r\ngradual abolition of slavery--belongs the honor of first attempting\r\nto awaken public sentiment on the subject. Upon his visit to Boston,\r\nAugust 7, 1828, he made the acquaintance of Garrison, whose eyes he\r\nopened to the iniquity of the slave system. During the same year Mr.\r\nGarrison accepted the invitation of a committee of prominent\r\ncitizens of Bennington, Vt., to edit the _Journal of the Times_, a\r\nweekly newspaper devoted to the re-election of John Quincy Adams\r\nagainst Andrew Jackson. While started for campaign purposes, the\r\n_Journal of the Times_ declared for independence of party and\r\nadvocated the suppression of intemperance, the gradual emancipation\r\nof the slave, the doctrines of peace, and the so-called American\r\nsystem of protection for fostering native industry.\r\n\r\nAttracted by the anti-slavery utterances of Mr. Garrison, Lundy\r\nresolved to invite him to share in the editorship of his paper,\r\nwalking from Baltimore to Bennington for the purpose. His\r\nearnestness had the desired effect upon Mr. Garrison, who accepted\r\nhis proffer and relinquished the _Journal of the Times_. Before\r\ngoing to Baltimore Mr. Garrison was invited to address the\r\nCongregational societies of Boston on July 4th, at the Park Street\r\nChurch, and took for his theme \"Dangers to the Nation.\" The poet\r\nJohn Pierpont was present and wrote a hymn for the occasion. The\r\naddress was a stirring denunciation of slavery and a rebuke to the\r\nnation for its pretentious devotion to liberty. The speaker was\r\naccused by a Boston paper of slandering his country and blaspheming\r\nthe Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at Baltimore, Garrison, having convinced himself of\r\nthe necessity of immediate and unconditional emancipation, it was\r\nagreed, inasmuch as Lundy adhered to the methods of gradual\r\nemancipation, that each should sign his own editorials.\r\n\r\nMr. Todd, a Newburyport merchant, having allowed his ship to be used\r\nin the inter-state slave trade between Baltimore and New Orleans,\r\nMr. Garrison faithfully denounced in unmeasured terms his\r\nfellow-townsman, and asserted the equal wickedness of the domestic\r\nslave trade with that of the foreign traffic, which, at that time,\r\nwas in the law considered piracy. Arrested, tried, and convicted of\r\nlibel, although the facts were proven, Garrison was incarcerated in\r\nthe Baltimore jail, April 17, 1830, in default of a fine of $50 with\r\n$50 costs. Undaunted in his captivity, he continued to write his\r\nprotest against slavery and to record in verse his feelings. His\r\nfamous sonnet, \"The Immortal Mind,\" was written with pencil upon the\r\nwalls of his cell. Liberated at the expiration of forty-nine days,\r\nthrough the generosity of Arthur Tappan, of New York, who paid his\r\nfine, Garrison visited Boston and Newburyport, endeavoring to speak\r\nin both places, but the doors of halls and churches were closed\r\nagainst him. At last the hall used by a society of avowed infidels,\r\nin Boston, to whom Abner Kneeland preached, was opened to Mr.\r\nGarrison for three anti-slavery lectures, and among the audience at\r\nhis first lecture were Samuel J. May, Samuel E. Sewall, and A.\r\nBronson Alcott, who then gave in their adhesion to the cause. Dr.\r\nLyman Beecher was also present but made no sign.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1831, appeared the first number of _The Liberator_, in\r\nBoston, bearing for its motto, \"Our Country is the World--Our\r\nCountrymen are Mankind.\" Mr. Garrison, as editor, was assisted by\r\nIsaac Knapp, a fellow-printer from Newburyport, as publisher. The\r\npaper was issued at No. 6 Merchants' Hall, at the corner of Congress\r\nand Water Streets, in the third story, the partners making their\r\nhome in the printing-office. It was this office that Harrison Gray\r\nOtis, the mayor, at the request of ex-Senator Hayne, ferreted out\r\nthrough his police, describing it as \"an obscure hole,\" containing\r\nthe editor and a negro boy, \"his only visible auxiliary,\" while his\r\nsupporters were \"a very few insignificant persons of all colors.\"\r\nLowell has thus described it in a different spirit:\r\n\r\n  \"In a small chamber, friendless and unseen,\r\n      Toiled o'er his types, one poor, unlearned young man;\r\n   The place was dark, unfurnitured, and mean,\r\n      Yet there the freedom of a race began.\"\r\n\r\nIn the initial editorial appeared the famous declaration of Mr.\r\nGarrison, \"I am in earnest--I will not equivocate--I will not\r\nexcuse--I will not retreat a single inch--and I will be heard.\"\r\nAlthough its circulation was meagre, the publication of _The\r\nLiberator_ made a tremendous sensation throughout the South,\r\nbringing upon its editor abusive and threatening language, and, at\r\nthe North, unpopularity and persecution. The Legislature of Georgia\r\noffered a reward of $5,000 for his arrest and conviction.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, the New England Anti-Slavery Society was organized in\r\nBoston, and the campaign for \"immediate and unconditional\r\nemancipation\" begun. The Colonization Society, which Mr. Garrison\r\nformerly supported but later denounced, became the object of special\r\nattack as an ally of the slave power, and, to counteract its\r\ndesigns, he sailed for England, May 2, 1833, to expose its\r\nproslavery purposes to the English abolitionists. He was cordially\r\nreceived by Wilberforce, Buxton, Zachary, Macaulay, Daniel\r\nO'Connell, and their associates in the struggle for West India\r\nemancipation, and before he left the kingdom he witnessed the\r\npassage of the Emancipation Act, and was present at the funeral of\r\nWilberforce, in Westminster Abbey. Returning from his successful\r\nmission abroad he narrowly escaped the hands of a New York mob on\r\nlanding upon his native soil.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1833, the American Anti-Slavery Society was formed, in\r\nPhiladelphia, and Mr. Garrison drew up its famous Declaration of\r\nSentiments, which numbered among its signers many of the men and\r\nwomen destined to be distinguished in the anti-slavery cause, among\r\nwhom was the poet Whittier.\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 1834, Mr. Garrison was married to Miss Helen Eliza\r\nBenson, of Brooklyn, Conn.; a fortunate and happy union.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, the eminent English orator, George Thompson, came by\r\ninvitation to the United States to assist in the emancipation of the\r\nAmerican, as he had of the West Indian, slave. The announcement\r\nthat he would speak at a meeting of the Ladies' Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, held in Boston, October 21st, of the same year, was the\r\noccasion of a mob composed of wealthy and respectable citizens of\r\nBoston who aimed to suppress free speech and tar and feather Mr.\r\nThompson. He was, however, prevented from attending by his friends,\r\nbut the fury of the mob fell upon Mr. Garrison, who was seized and\r\nled through the streets with a rope around his body, from which\r\nposition he was rescued through the efforts of Mayor Lyman and\r\nimprisoned for safety in the Leverett Street jail. This outrage\r\ncreated new friends and gave fresh impetus to the abolition\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Mr. Garrison again visited England as a delegate of the\r\nWorld's Anti-Slavery Convention in London, in which body, however,\r\nhe declined to sit, because the women who were his fellow-delegates\r\nfrom America were excluded.\r\n\r\nOccupied continuously with the care of _The Liberator_ and in\r\nlecturing, Mr. Garrison led an intensely active life, not confining\r\nhimself alone to the anti-slavery reform but embracing among other\r\nreforms those of temperance, non-resistance, women's rights, and\r\nreligious freedom. For, while educated by his mother in the strict\r\ntenets of the Baptist faith, he early experienced a change of\r\ntheological views and cast off sectarian bonds. _The Liberator_ was\r\nused for the expression of his individual beliefs and was not the\r\norgan of any society.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, the Free Church of Scotland having sent emissaries to the\r\nUnited States to collect funds from the slaveholders, Mr. Garrison\r\nagain went to England to urge the Church to return the money thus\r\ncontributed, and, in company with George Thompson, Frederick\r\nDouglass, Henry C. Wright and others, agitated the question\r\nthroughout Scotland.\r\n\r\nConvinced that the constitutional compact of the North with the\r\nSouth to guard and protect slavery was immoral and unjust, in 1843\r\nMr. Garrison raised the banner of No Union with Slave-Holders, and\r\nadvocated the dissolution of the Union for the sake of freedom, a\r\nstep which added fresh fuel to the flames of persecution and\r\nincurred the loss of many lukewarm adherents.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, the apostasy of Daniel Webster and the passage of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law increased the national ferment. The same year\r\nwitnessed the famous Rynder's mob, in New York, and the anti-slavery\r\nmeeting at the Tabernacle, at which Mr. Garrison spoke, was\r\nviolently broken up.\r\n\r\nThe abolition movement had now assumed formidable proportions,\r\ndominating the national parties and dictating issues. The Whig party\r\nfell to pieces in consequence, and to it succeeded the Republican\r\nparty, with Sumner, Seward, Wilson, Giddings, and other earnest men\r\nas leaders. Meanwhile Harriet Beecher Stowe, by her famous novel,\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" had given a vivid picture of the wrongs of\r\nAmerican slavery to the world. The \"irrepressible conflict\" was now\r\nrapidly tending to its crisis, and, on the election of Abraham\r\nLincoln to the Presidency by the Republican party, in 1860, the\r\nsignal for civil war was given, and, in 1861, the struggle of arms\r\ninaugurated by the attack on Fort Sumter replaced the peaceful\r\ncrusade of the abolitionists.\r\n\r\nThe moral agitation of thirty years had produced its legitimate\r\nresults, and when, in 1863, the President promulgated the\r\nemancipation proclamation the anti-slavery chapter was closed. The\r\nUnion, which heretofore had been paramount to liberty, was now\r\nsubordinated to it, and Mr. Garrison's antagonism necessarily ceased\r\nwith the new amendment to the Constitution. He had been accustomed\r\nto denounce that instrument as a \"covenant with death and an\r\nagreement with hell,\" but, as he expressed it, he had \"never\r\nexpected to see Death and Hell secede.\" Foreseeing the inevitable\r\nconsequence of the war, he gave heartily his moral support to the\r\nGovernment in the struggle between it and the slave power. His\r\nnon-resistance principles and abhorrence of war in no way diminished\r\nhis interest in the great conflict, and his sympathies of necessity\r\nwere with the soldiers of freedom. His eldest son, George Thompson\r\nGarrison, not sharing his father's scruples, enlisted in the\r\nFifty-fifth Colored Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers, attaining\r\nthe rank of captain.\r\n\r\nThe renomination of Lincoln for a second term, in 1864, developed a\r\nbreach in the ranks of the old abolitionists, Mr. Garrison and his\r\nadherents supporting Lincoln, and others, under the lead of Wendell\r\nPhillips, advocating the choice of General Frémont. The latter\r\ncandidate, however, withdrew from the field before the election.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1865, Mr. Garrison, with his English friend George\r\nThompson, was invited by the Government to be present as its guest\r\nat the ceremony of raising the Stars and Stripes above the\r\nsurrendered Fort Sumter, and was received at Charleston with great\r\nenthusiasm by the emancipated slaves. The news of President\r\nLincoln's assassination hastened the return of the party to the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nThe practical extermination of the slave system by the adoption of\r\nthe 13th Amendment convinced Mr. Garrison that the purpose of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society and of _The Liberator_ had been accomplished.\r\nHe therefore withdrew from one and discontinued the other. After\r\nthirty-five years of a stormy and precarious existence the last\r\nnumber of _The Liberator_ was issued December 29, 1865. \"Nothing\r\ncould have been more in keeping with the uniform wisdom of your\r\nanti-slavery leadership than the time you chose for resigning it,\"\r\nwrote Lowell to Mr. Garrison a year later.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the pioneer's unselfish service thereupon took\r\nshape in a national testimonial reaching a sum exceeding thirty\r\nthousand dollars, thenceforth lifting his life above the pecuniary\r\ncares which had so long weighed upon it. A domestic grief in the\r\nshape of a paralytic shock to his faithful wife occurred in\r\nDecember, 1863, compelling a change of home from the city to an\r\nattractive suburban house in Roxbury, known as Rockledge.\r\n\r\nAlthough his great life-work was finished, Mr. Garrison abated no\r\nactivity in the various reforms in which he had enlisted. Both with\r\nvoice and pen he reached a wider and more attentive public, pleading\r\nfor justice to the freedman, for the legal emancipation of women,\r\nthe right of the Chinese to free immigration and Christian\r\ntreatment, freedom of trade (for he early eschewed his youthful\r\nbelief in the protective system), and for kindred causes.\r\n\r\nVisiting England for the fourth time in 1867, a public breakfast was\r\ngiven in Mr. Garrison's honor at St. James's Hall, June 29th. John\r\nBright presided, and among the addresses of welcome were those of\r\nEarl Russell, the Duke of Argyll, John Stuart Mill, George Thompson,\r\nand W. Vernon Harcourt. Later the freedom of the city of Edinburgh\r\nwas conferred upon the American abolitionist, and in August he\r\nattended the International Anti-Slavery Conference at Paris,\r\nrepresenting the American Freedman's Union Commission, and meeting\r\nLaboulaye, Cochin, and other eminent Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nThe troubled period of reconstruction, involving the defence of the\r\nfreedmen's rights, found no more interested observer and participant\r\nthan Mr. Garrison. The former hostile treatment which had been meted\r\nout to him by press and party was of the past, and, like Lincoln,\r\n\r\n  \"He heard the hisses change to cheers,\r\n   The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,\r\n   And took both in the same unwavering mood.\"\r\n\r\nUnique among reformers, he received in life the reverence that\r\nusually reveals itself in post-mortem honors which indicate the late\r\nawakening of public consciousness and suggest the pathos of their\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThe felicities of domestic life were his in more than ordinary\r\nmeasure, and \"honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,\" made his\r\nclosing years as serene as his opening career had been stormy.\r\nOccasional ailments reminded him of advancing age, but his\r\ntemperamental cheerfulness and faith in human progress never forsook\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe death of his dear wife, in 1876, was a visible blow to him, and\r\nin the next year, for physical and mental recuperation, he visited\r\nEngland again for the last time, with his son Francis, enjoying a\r\ndelightful reunion with old friends and making new ones, as was his\r\nwont.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1879, during a visit to his daughter in New York, he\r\nbreathed his last on the 24th of the month, with all his children\r\nabout him. He left four sons, named respectively, George Thompson,\r\nWilliam Lloyd, Wendell Phillips, and Francis Jackson, and an only\r\ndaughter, Helen Francis, the wife of Henry Villard. Two others, a\r\ndaughter and a son, died at an early age.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, Mr. Garrison's biography, written by his sons Wendell\r\nPhillips and Francis Jackson, was published by the Century Company,\r\nin four volumes, octavo. They contain not only the personal details\r\nof a famous career, but a careful history of the abolition struggle.\r\nTo them the future historian must look for the most faithful picture\r\nof the anti-slavery times and their leader.\r\n\r\nA bronze statue of heroic size, executed by Olin L. Warner, of New\r\nYork, representing Mr. Garrison in a sitting posture, was presented\r\nto the city of Boston by several eminent citizens, in 1886, and is\r\nplaced on Commonwealth Avenue, opposite the Hotel Vendome.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrison's calm estimate of himself has been preserved and may\r\nfitly conclude this sketch:\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, he who commences any reform which at last becomes one\r\nof transcendent importance and is crowned with victory, is always\r\nill-judged and unfairly estimated. At the outset he is looked upon\r\nwith contempt, and treated in the most opprobrious manner, as a wild\r\nfanatic or a dangerous disorganizer. In due time the cause grows and\r\nadvances to its sure triumph; and in proportion as it nears the\r\ngoal, the popular estimate of his character changes, till finally\r\nexcessive panegyric is substituted for outrageous abuse. The praise,\r\non the one hand, and the defamation on the other, are equally\r\nunmerited. In the clear light of reason, it will be seen that he\r\nsimply stood up to discharge a duty which he owed to his God, to his\r\nfellow-men, to the land of his nativity.\"\r\n\r\n[Signature: William Lloyd Garrison.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELISHA KENT KANE[15]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 15: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy General A. W. GREELY\r\n\r\n(1820-1857)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elisha Kent Kane.]\r\n\r\n\r\nElisha Kent Kane, son of Judge John K. Kane, was born in\r\nPhiladelphia, February 3, 1820. In his youth he displayed those\r\nqualifications of ceaseless activity, daring adventure, and strong\r\npersonal courage which characterized his mature manhood. Inclined to\r\nall efforts involving physical hardships and contact with nature,\r\nhis early education was devoted to civil engineering and such\r\nnatural sciences as chemistry, geography, geology, and mineralogy.\r\nUnfortunately, in his sixteenth year, chronic and functional heart\r\ndisease developed, which intermittently affected him through life\r\nand deterred him from the profession of an engineer. Applying\r\nhimself to medicine, he graduated therein in 1842 at the University\r\nof Pennsylvania, in the meantime having served as a resident\r\nphysician of the Pennsylvania Hospital. His inaugural medical\r\nthesis, based on personal experiments and observations, gave him a\r\nreputation which augured professional prominence. In 1843 he was\r\nappointed physician to the United States embassy to China, under\r\nCaleb Cushing, who was charged with the negotiation of a treaty with\r\nthat country. At the way ports and during the tedious intervals of\r\nthe treaty negotiations, Kane lost no opportunity of travel and\r\nadventure. With Baron Löe he visited the Philippine Islands and the\r\nvolcano of Tael. Not content with the usual point of view, and\r\ndespite the protestations of the native guides, he was lowered two\r\nhundred feet in the crater, whence he scrambled downward to the\r\nsmoking sulphur lake and dipped his specimen bottles into its\r\nsteaming waters. In his ascent the loose, heated ashes charred his\r\nboots and gave way under his feet, the sulphur vapors nearly\r\nasphyxiated him, he fell repeatedly, and was barely able to tie the\r\nbamboo rope around him. Drawn up in an exhausted condition, and\r\ncarried to a neighboring hermitage, he barely escaped violence at\r\nthe hands of the offended natives, who considered his rash feat a\r\nsacrilege.\r\n\r\nResigning his appointment with the legation, Kane established\r\nhimself as a physician at Whampoa, on the Canton River, where\r\nillness shortly broke up his professional practice. Fortunately for\r\nhis future fame he was unsuccessful in his application to the\r\nSpanish Government for permission to practise medicine at Manilla,\r\nand Kane returned to the United States by the way of Singapore,\r\nIndia, Egypt, and Europe, his journey marked by adventure and\r\ndanger. In these, as in all other sea voyages, he suffered\r\nexcessively from sea-sickness, which required all of his indomitable\r\nwill to endure with equanimity.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 he was commissioned assistant surgeon in the United States\r\nNavy; his first sea duty took him to the west coast of Africa, where\r\ncoast fever invalided him within ten months. His desire for active\r\nservice was so great that before his health was re-established he\r\nobtained orders from the Secretary of the Navy to proceed to\r\nhead-quarters of the army, then in the City of Mexico, for duty in\r\nconnection with the collection of data relative to field hospitals\r\nand surgical statistics. Here his activity and daring resulted in\r\nhis being wounded in a guerilla skirmish.\r\n\r\nAssigned temporarily to a surveying vessel, circumstances soon\r\ndetermined Kane's career and gave full scope to his enthusiastic\r\nenergies, and insured his future fame. The appeals of Lady Franklin,\r\nthe recommendations of President Taylor, and the generosity of Henry\r\nGrinnell, had culminated in the organization of a search expedition\r\nfor Franklin in the Arctic regions. It was provided that the vessels\r\nshould be manned by volunteers from the Navy, and among those\r\noffering their services for this mission of humanity none was more\r\nimportunate than Kane. Persistent efforts brought him orders for\r\nthis fateful voyage while bathing in the tepid waters of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, and ten days later he sailed from New York for the icy\r\nwastes of the North as surgeon of De Haven's flag-ship, the Advance.\r\nThis search, known in Arctic history as the First Grinnell\r\nExpedition, was made under a joint resolution of the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, dated May 2, 1850, \"to accept and attach to the Navy\r\ntwo vessels offered by Henry Grinnell, Esq., to be sent to the\r\nArctic seas in search of Sir John Franklin and his companions.\" Two\r\nvery small sailing brigs constituted the fleet, the flag-ship\r\nAdvance, commanded by De Haven, an officer of Antarctic experience\r\nunder Wilkes, and the Rescue, under Master Griffin; the entire party\r\nnumbered thirty-three officers and men.\r\n\r\nTheir objective point was Lancaster Sound and its westward\r\nextension, Barrow Strait, whence either or both Wellington Channel\r\nand Cape Walker were to be visited. The squadron passed safely\r\nthrough Davis Strait, and skirting the dreaded land-ice of Melville\r\nBay, reached Cape York after three weeks of constant and dangerous\r\nstruggle with the heavy ice, which nearly destroyed the Rescue,\r\nborne almost on her beam-ends by the enormous pressure from a moving\r\nice-pack. De Haven fell in with the English squadrons on the same\r\nerrand, August 19, 1850, and, entering Lancaster Sound with his\r\nBritish consorts, devoted his energies to the search in hand.\r\nGriffin, of the Rescue, shared with Captain Ommaney, R. N., the\r\nhonors of the discovery, at Beechy island, of the wintering-place of\r\nFranklin's squadron in 1845-46. Later three graves of members of\r\nFranklin's party were found, and numerous evidences of the good\r\ncondition and activity of the expedition during that winter. About\r\nthree weeks later, on September 10, 1850, De Haven concluded that\r\nthe position attained was not sufficiently advantageous to justify\r\nhis wintering, and so decided to return to the United States.\r\nUnfortunately, strong gales and very cold weather prevented\r\nimmediate action, and in a few days both brigs were frozen immovably\r\nin an enormous ice-pack, where they were destined to drift\r\nhelplessly to and fro at the mercy of the winds and currents for\r\nmany months.\r\n\r\nBeset in Wellington Channel, to the north of Beechy Island, the\r\nAmerican squadron first found itself drifting slowly, but with\r\nalarming steadiness, to the north, into waters and along coasts that\r\nhad, as far as they then knew, never been visited. The drift carried\r\nthe Advance to latitude 75° 25' north, longitude 91° 31' west, and\r\non September 22d they discovered new land, to which De Haven gave\r\nthe merited name of Grinnell. It proved to be an integral part of\r\nNorth Devon, of which it was the northwestern extension. Every few\r\ndays there was a partial breaking up of the pack and consequent\r\ndanger of destruction. On one occasion, says Kane: \"We are lifted\r\nbodily eighteen inches out of water. The hummocks are reared up\r\naround the ship, so as to rise a couple of feet above our bulwarks,\r\nfive feet above our deck. They are very often ten and twelve feet\r\nhigh, and threaten to overwhelm us. Add to this, darkness, snow,\r\ncold, and the absolute destitution of surrounding shores.\" The\r\ntemperature fell below zero and the ships seemed destined to winter\r\nin Wellington Channel, but fortunately a strong northwest gale, in\r\nconjunction with heavy tides, disintegrated the main pack and set\r\nships, ice and all, southward into Barrow Strait. Here they fell\r\nunder the action of a southeasterly current and, drifting all\r\nwinter, passed slowly through Lancaster Sound into Baffin Bay, where\r\nthe opening polar summer found them yet fast in the ice, from which\r\nthe two brigs were freed off Cape Walsingham, June 5, 1851, after\r\ndrifting in eight and a half months a distance of ten hundred and\r\nfifty miles. It is impossible to adequately describe their physical\r\ndiscomforts and dangers, the mental depression of the sunless\r\nmidwinter of eight weeks, and the even harder experiences of the\r\nArctic spring-tide, when excessive cold and increasing lassitude\r\nmade steady inroads on their impaired constitutions. Kane tells us\r\nthey were continually harassed by uncertainties as to their ultimate\r\nfate. Yesterday the unbroken floe, stretching as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, seemed so firm and stable as to insure months of quiet,\r\nuninterrupted life. Today, the groaning, uneasy pack, yielding to an\r\nunseen power, split and cracked in all directions, throwing up huge\r\nmasses of solid ice, that threatened to destroy instantly the ship,\r\nand occasionally opened in wide cracks through which rushed the open\r\nsea. Indeed, the conditions were so critical and the ice-movements\r\nso rapid, that the entire party, within the brief space of\r\ntwenty-four hours, had four times made ready to abandon their\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nIn March the cold became intense, and for a week it averaged\r\nfifty-three degrees below the freezing-point. Scurvy assailed all\r\nbut five of the crew, and De Haven was so ill that all his duties\r\ndevolved on Griffin, who heroically bore up under disease and the\r\nmental and moral responsibilities that the situation forced on him.\r\nIn all his efforts Griffin had no more effective coadjutor than the\r\nfleet-surgeon, Kane. Whether acting as a medical officer, treating\r\nskilfully the diseased crew; as a hunter, supplementing their scanty\r\nstock of anti-scorbutic food with the fresh meat of the seal; or as\r\na man, devising means of amusement and stimulating them to mental\r\nand physical exertions, Kane incessantly displayed such qualities of\r\ncheerfulness, activity, and ingenuity as tended to dispel the pall\r\nof despair that sometimes enveloped the whole expedition.\r\n\r\nWhen release from the ice permitted the voyage to be renewed, De\r\nHaven decided to refit in the Greenland ports and again return to\r\nLancaster Sound; fortunately, as the squadron was not fitted for a\r\nsecond year's work, the ice in Melville Bay was such as to prevent\r\nimmediate passage, and so they turned southward, reaching the United\r\nStates on September 30, 1851.\r\n\r\nSuch desperate experiences as those involved in the midwinter drift\r\nof the Advance, would have deterred most men for a time from a\r\nsecond voyage, but with Kane the stimulus to future work apparently\r\nincreased with every league that he sailed southward. The ship was\r\nhardly in port before he initiated a plan for another expedition in\r\nthe spring of 1852. This failing he wrote Lady Franklin in May,\r\noffering to go with Captain Penny, or any good sailing-master, to\r\ngive his services without pay, and pledging himself to go to work\r\nand raise funds.\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to go with any British expedition, he turned\r\nhis entire efforts to organizing another from America. His chivalric\r\nenthusiasm enlisted the sympathies and active support of Henry\r\nGrinnell and George Peabody, the first loaning the ship and the\r\nlatter contributing $10,000 for general expenses. The United States\r\nagain aided, not only putting Kane on sea-pay, but also attached ten\r\nmen of the Navy, under government pay. Instruments, provisions,\r\netc., were likewise supplied by the Secretary of the Navy, and aid\r\nin other directions was afforded by the Smithsonian Institution, the\r\nNaval Observatory, and other scientific associations. At this\r\njuncture the discoveries of Captain Inglefield, R. N., in Smith\r\nSound, afforded to Kane a new route for his activities. The scheme,\r\nas far as the search for Franklin was concerned, was well-meaning,\r\nbut none the less fallacious and illogical. Kane was personally\r\ncognizant of the fact that Franklin had gone into Lancaster Sound,\r\nand had wintered in 1845-46 at Beechy Island, plainly following the\r\ndirect and positive orders of the Admiralty, that he should push\r\nsouthward from Cape Walker to the neighborhood of Behring Strait.\r\nMoreover, the last mail ever received from the Franklin expedition\r\ncontained a letter from Captain Fitz-James, in which he stated that\r\nFranklin had shown him the orders, expressed his disbelief in an\r\nopen sea to the north, and had given \"a pleasant account of his\r\nexpectations of being able to get through the ice on the north coast\r\nof America.\"\r\n\r\nA search for Franklin by the way of Smith Sound, seventeen degrees\r\nof longitude and four degrees of latitude to the north and east of\r\nhis last known position, was to assume not only that Franklin had\r\ndisobeyed the strict letter of his instructions, but had also\r\nabandoned his voyage after having accomplished one-third of the\r\ndistance from Greenland to Behring Strait.\r\n\r\nAs the initiator and inspirer of the expedition, Kane was the\r\nnatural head of it, but there were difficulties in the way.\r\n\r\nThe assignment of a surgeon to the command of a naval expedition was\r\nunprecedented; but somehow Kane succeeded in overcoming even the\r\ntime-honored observances of the Navy, and was placed in command by a\r\nformal order of the Secretary of the Navy in November, 1852.\r\n\r\nKane repeatedly set forth his belief in an open Polar sea, and\r\nannounced his expectation of reaching it. The expedition was not\r\nalone a proposed search for Franklin, but especially contemplated\r\nthe continuation to the northward of the discoveries made in 1851 by\r\nCaptain Inglefield, on the west coast of Greenland. Kane declared\r\nhis intention of reaching \"its most northern attainable point, and\r\nthence pressing on toward the Pole as far as boats or sleds could\r\ncarry us, examine the coast lines for vestiges of the lost party,\"\r\nand \"seeking the _open sea_ ... launch our little boats, and embark\r\nupon its waters.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 30, 1853, the expedition left New York in the sailing brig\r\nAdvance, there being seventeen members all told. The vessel was\r\nstanch, well-fitted, and suitable, the scientific instruments\r\nsatisfactory, but the provisions were illy chosen for Arctic\r\nservice, and the equipment in many respects inadequate or deficient.\r\nThe Greenland ports supplied skin-clothing, dogs, and Eskimo\r\ndog-drivers; the latter being destined to play an important part in\r\nestablishing harmonious relations with the Etah natives. On reaching\r\nMelville Bay, Kane decided to take the middle passage, direct\r\nthrough the dreaded pack--a most venturesome route for a\r\nsailing-vessel. Favored by an off-shore gale, the Advance escaped\r\nwith the loss of a whaleboat, and emerged into the open sea near\r\nCape York, known as the North Water. Stopped by the ice, Kane wisely\r\ndecided to cache his metallic life-boat, filled with boat-stores, on\r\nLittleton Island, so as to secure his retreat, since, as he says:\r\n\"My mind was made up from the first that we are to force our way to\r\nthe north as far as the elements will let us.\" The ice opening with\r\nthe tide, Kane rounded Cape Hatherton and was now in Kane Sea; but\r\nthe Advance was immediately driven into a cove for shelter. At the\r\nfirst opportunity sail was again made and a short distance gained to\r\nthe east-northeast, when a violent gale nearly wrecked her. Repeated\r\nefforts to work the vessel to the eastward, along a lee coast,\r\ndestroyed fittings and boat, and were so fruitful in danger that on\r\nAugust 26th seven out of his eight officers addressed Kane in\r\nwriting, to the effect \"that a further progress to the North was\r\nimpossible, and [they] were in favor of returning southward to\r\nwinter.\" Unfortunately, Kane was not \"able conscientiously to take\r\nthe same view,\" as such retreat would have left him in a less\r\nfavorable situation to pursue his explorations. Two weeks longer the\r\nbrig was warped to the east during high water, whenever she was not\r\njammed by huge floes against the rugged coast; but at low water the\r\nbrig grounded and was daily in danger of total destruction. Finally,\r\non September 9th, she was put in winter-quarters in 78° 37' N., 71°\r\n14' W., in Rensselaer Harbor, which, says Kane, \"we were fated never\r\nto leave together--a long resting-place to her, for the same ice is\r\nround her still.\" Winter now advanced with startling rapidity and\r\nexcessive severity; freezing temperatures now permanently obtained,\r\nthe water-fowl were gone, and the scanty vegetation blighted. All\r\nwere busy, some constructing a building for magnetic and\r\nmeteorological observations, others making journeys along the\r\neastern coast. Kane visited the high land adjoining Mary Minturn\r\nRiver, some fifty miles away, whence he could see Washington Land in\r\nthe vicinity of Cape Constitution. Hayes and Wilson journeyed on the\r\ninland ice, while McGary with six others made three caches on the\r\ncoast, the farthest being under the face of the largest of all\r\nArctic glaciers, now known by the name of Humboldt. The winter\r\nproved to be unusually cold, the temperature, from December to March\r\ninclusive, averaging fifty-four degrees below the freezing-point of\r\nwater. Most fortunately the men remained in health, but Kane grieved\r\nover the loss of his dogs, only a dozen surviving out of the\r\noriginal eighty.\r\n\r\nIn this contingency Kane decided to put his men in the field, and\r\nafter two weeks of excessive cold, the temperature averaging\r\nseventy-seven degrees below freezing, a party was sent out while the\r\nmercury was yet frozen. Their orders were to reach Washington Land,\r\nabout one hundred miles distant across the sea-ice. It soon became\r\nevident to Brooks, the commander of the party, that the journey was\r\nimpossible of execution, and after eight marches, in which less than\r\nforty miles were traversed, he turned back on March 29, 1854. The\r\ncold that day was intense, about ninety degrees below freezing, and\r\nthe next morning four men were frozen so badly that they could not\r\nwalk. Only four men were left for work. The distance to the brig was\r\nthirty miles, while the intervening ice was so rough that they could\r\nnot drag their disabled comrades. Hickey volunteered to remain,\r\nwhile Sontag, Ohlsen, and Petersen should go to the brig for help.\r\nThe three men finally reached the Advance, but they were so\r\nphysically exhausted and in such mental condition that they could\r\nnot even indicate in what direction they had left their comrades.\r\n\r\nKane appreciated the gravity of the situation and the necessity of\r\nprompt measures. A relief party was at once started, which Kane led\r\nhimself, despite his impaired health, physical weakness, and general\r\nunfitness for such a desperate journey; as always, he spared not\r\nhimself when danger threatened. Ohlsen, being the clearest-headed of\r\nthe sledgemen, was put in a sleeping-bag and dragged on a sledge as\r\na guide.\r\n\r\nEighteen hours' travel were without tangible result; Kane fainted\r\ntwice on the snow; his stoutest men were seized with trembling fits,\r\nand as yet no signs of the missing party. Fortunately Kane had taken\r\nthe Eskimo, Hans Hendrik, whose keen eye discovered the track that\r\nled to the tent of the frozen men. They were alive, but crippled\r\nbeyond the possibility of marching. The weather remained fine or all\r\nwould have perished, and as it was, Hayes, the surgeon, in his\r\nreport of their condition on reaching the brig, said: \"I was\r\nstartled by their ghastly appearance. When I hailed them they met me\r\nonly with a vacant, wild stare. They were to a man delirious.\" Of\r\nthe eight men only one returned sound; two shortly died, two others\r\nsuffered amputations, and three escaped with temporary disabilities.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, on April 26th, Kane set out on what, to use his\r\nown words, \"was to be the crowning expedition of the campaign, to\r\nattain the Ultima Thule of the Greenland shore.\" Impressed with the\r\nimpracticability of a direct journey across the main ice-pack, he\r\ndecided to follow the shore-line, five men dragging a sledge, while\r\nKane and Godfrey travelled by dog-team. He had been led by his\r\nresolute spirit to overestimate the physical strength of his men and\r\nhimself, and the party broke down before it had even approached the\r\nHumboldt Glacier. Their enthusiastic leader was stricken with\r\nfainting spells and rigidity of limbs, but Kane would not admit his\r\nillness to be more than temporary, and bidding the men strap him on\r\nthe sledge, proceeded onward. His diminished physical powers now\r\nbecame evident through the freezing of his rigid and swollen limbs.\r\nDelirious and fainting at the end of the march, he was carried in an\r\nalmost insensible condition to his tent, when his men wisely took\r\nthe matter in their own hands and started back for the brig. Nine\r\ndays later, through forced marches and heroic efforts of his\r\nsledge-mates, themselves partially disabled, Kane was carried on\r\nboard the Advance fluctuating between life and death. Hardly\r\nconscious, his mind clouded, and his swollen features barely\r\nrecognizable, his general condition was such that the surgeon\r\nregarded his ultimate recovery as nearly hopeless.\r\n\r\nWhile Kane's recuperative powers were simply marvellous, yet he did\r\nnot recover sufficiently to make another journey that spring. In\r\nthis extremity he turned to his surgeon, Israel I. Hayes, who\r\nvolunteered to explore the unknown shores of Grinnell Land, which\r\nlay in sight to the west of Smith Sound. With the seaman Godfrey as\r\na companion and a dog-team as the means of transportation, Hayes\r\nstruggled through the almost impassable floes and bergs of the main\r\nstrait and finally attained Cape Hayes, on the western coast, in\r\nabout 79° 45' N. latitude. The return journey to the Advance was\r\npossible only by abandoning everything that in the slightest degree\r\nimpeded the progress of the exhausted men and famishing dogs.\r\n\r\nThis success caused Kane to make one more effort to reach the\r\nhitherto inaccessible Washington Land, and for this purpose he\r\nplaced all his means at the disposal of one of his seamen, William\r\nMorton. A supporting party accompanied Morton to Humboldt Glacier,\r\nwhence he proceeded with Eskimo Hans Hendrik and a dog-team on the\r\nadvance journey. Their track lay over the sea-ice, about five miles\r\nfrom, and parallel with, the face of the glacier. Five days took\r\nthem to the new land to the north, and three days later, June 24,\r\n1854, Morton reached alone an impassable headland, Cape\r\nConstitution. From the highest attainable elevation Morton found his\r\nview completely cut off to the northeast, but between the west and\r\nnorth he could see the southeastern half of Kennedy's Channel as far\r\nnorth as Mount Ross, 80° 58' N. He says \"Not a speck of ice was to\r\nbe seen as far as I could observe; the sea was open, the swell came\r\nfrom the northward ... and the surf broke in on the rocks below in\r\nregular breakers.\" Morton described accurately the general\r\nlandscape, but he was an incompetent astronomical observer, and his\r\nestimates of distances were excessive. The farthest point was\r\ncharted nearly a hundred miles north of its true position, while\r\nCape Constitution was placed 31 miles too far north by Morton and 52\r\ngeographic miles by Kane, who \"corrected\" Morton's observations by a\r\nseries of erroneous bearings. Morton's general account of his\r\nexplorations has been confirmed by Hans Hendrik in his Memoir\r\nwritten some years since in Eskimo.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Etah Eskimo, natives of Prudhoe land, had\r\ndiscovered the brig, and through the interpreter, Hans Hendrik,\r\npromptly established friendly relations with Kane. It may be said\r\nthat the expedition owed its final safety to these natives; their\r\nsupplies of fresh meat checked scurvy, and later their dog teams\r\nrendered retreat possible. Slight misunderstandings, not always the\r\nfault of the natives, naturally occurred, but the Eskimo were\r\nhonest, humane, and willing, and never committed a hostile act.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1854 justified the expressed fears of Kane's officers,\r\nfor it passed with the ice yet unbroken in Rensselaer Harbor. It was\r\nevident in July that the brig would never be freed from the ice, and\r\nin this critical situation, Kane, taking five men in a whaleboat,\r\nattempted to reach Beechy Island, several hundred miles to the\r\nsouthwest, whence he expected to obtain succor from the English\r\nsearching squadron. The unfavorable condition of the ice in Smith\r\nSound caused the failure of this attempt, and, yet worse, encouraged\r\nthe idea of dividing the party; an idea that culminated in the\r\nwell-known \"Arctic Boat Journey,\" as Dr. Hayes termed it. Despite\r\nKane's futile experiences in July, the majority of the party\r\nmaintained that a boat journey to Upernavik was both practicable and\r\nadvisable. Confronted by this attitude of the expeditionary force,\r\nKane assembled them, set forth the dangers of such an attempt, and\r\nvehemently urged them to abandon the project, which the lateness of\r\nthe season and the unfavorable ice conditions rendered most\r\nimprobable of success. Finally he granted the privilege of\r\nunfettered action to such as believed the journey practicable,\r\nstipulating only that those leaving the vessel should renounce, in\r\nwriting, all claims upon the expedition and should elect a leader.\r\nNine elected to go, eight to remain. Kane displayed a magnanimous\r\nspirit, equipping them most liberally, and assuring them, in\r\nwriting, that the brig should be ever open should disaster overtake\r\nthem. The boat journey was a failure, and Kane bade them welcome\r\nwhen, early in December, he learned that the party, some two hundred\r\nmiles distant and in imminent danger of perishing by starvation, was\r\ndesirous of returning to the Advance. Kane promptly sent supplies to\r\nthe suffering men, and, on December 12th, the entire crew was once\r\nagain upon the brig.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1854-5 passed wretchedly; the physical condition of\r\nthe party steadily deteriorated; failing fuel necessitated the\r\nburning of the upper woodwork of the brig; their food was reduced to\r\nordinary marine stores, and game failed equally to the hunters of\r\nthe Advance and the persistent efforts of the Etah natives on the\r\nice-clad land and in the frozen sea. In addition scurvy attacked the\r\ncrew; Hayes lost a portion of his frozen foot, and hardly a man of\r\nthe crew remained fit for duty. The necessity of abandoning the brig\r\nand retreating by boat to Upernavik, Danish Greenland, was now\r\nforced upon Kane's mind. The co-operation of the natives greatly\r\nfacilitated, if it did not alone render possible, the transportation\r\nof their provisions, boats, and stores to Cape Alexander. Kane says\r\nthe Eskimo \"brought daily supplies of birds, assisted in carrying\r\nboat stores, and invariably exhibited the kindest feelings and\r\nstrictest honesty.\"\r\n\r\nBidding farewell to the natives at Cape Alexander on June 15, 1855,\r\nCape York was passed, the land ice of Melville Bay followed, and the\r\nnorthern coast of Danish Greenland reached in forty-seven days. In\r\nthe meantime a relief squadron under command of Lieutenant\r\nHartstene, United States Navy, had visited Smith Sound, where the\r\nnatives informed him of Kane's journey southward. Taken on board the\r\nreturning flag-ship at Disco, Kane and his men reached New York,\r\nOctober 11, 1855.\r\n\r\nKane had hardly reached home when it became evident that his\r\nundermined constitution could not longer withstand the inroads of a\r\ndisease which for twenty years had afflicted him. Change of climate\r\nwas tried without avail, and he died at Havana, Cuba, February 16,\r\n1857, at the early age of thirty-seven.\r\n\r\nBetween his first and second voyages Kane had become deeply\r\ninterested in Margaretta Fox, one of the well-known spiritualists,\r\nwho later published their correspondence under the title of \"The\r\nLove Life of Dr. Kane.\" Their relations, it is believed, resulted in\r\na secret marriage shortly before Kane's death.\r\n\r\nThe rare literary skill shown in the account of Kane's expedition\r\nhas charmed millions of readers with its graphic account of the\r\nlabors, hardships, and privations of Kane and his men. It should\r\nnot, however, be considered that this expedition merits attention\r\nalone from its tales of suffering and bravery, for none other of\r\nthat generation contributed so materially to a correct knowledge of\r\nthe Arctic regions. In ethnology it gave the first full account of\r\nthe Etah Eskimo, the northernmost inhabitants of the world; in\r\nnatural history its data as to the flora and fauna of the isolated\r\nand ice-surrounded extremity of western Greenland were original,\r\nand have been to this day but scantily supplemented; in physical\r\nsciences, the magnetic, tidal, and climatic observations remained\r\nfor twenty years the most important series pertaining to the Arctic\r\nregions. Kane's voyage not only extended geographically Inglefield's\r\ndiscoveries a hundred miles to the northward, but it also opened up\r\na practical and safe route for Arctic exploration, which has been\r\nmore fruitful of successful results than any other.\r\n\r\nKane was a man of generous impulses, enthusiastic ideals, and kindly\r\nheart. His chivalric nature, indomitable will, and great courage\r\noften impelled him to hazardous enterprises; but he stands out in\r\nthis modern age as an unselfish character, willing to brave\r\nhardships and risk his own life on a vague possibility of rescuing\r\nFranklin and his companions.\r\n\r\n[Signature: A. W. Greely.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERDINAND DE LESSEPS[16]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 16: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy CLARENCE COOK\r\n\r\n(1805-1894)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ferdinand de Lesseps.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, as Dante sings: \"There is no greater grief than in a time of\r\nmisery to remember happier days,\" there are few persons in our time\r\nwho can testify more feelingly to the truth of the poet's words than\r\nFerdinand de Lesseps. For many years he was a bright-shining,\r\nsympathetic figure among those who lead in the van of our material\r\nprogress; and the accomplishment, by his initiative and energy, of\r\nthe long dream of the Suez Canal, made him the hero, not of his own\r\nnation alone, but of all the civilized world; honors were heaped\r\nupon him, and acclamations greeted him on every side. His name\r\nbecame a household word.\r\n\r\nA few years later, and all is changed. At the advanced age of\r\neighty-eight, Ferdinand de Lesseps is in deep disgrace. Charged with\r\nthe chief responsibility for the ruin brought about by the failure\r\nof another of his great enterprises--the Panama Canal--he has been\r\ncondemned by the tribunal to pay a huge fine, and has only been\r\nsaved from the shame of actual imprisonment by the knowledge of his\r\njudges that, in his feeble state of health, imprisonment would\r\nspeedily be fatal. As at the ceremonies on the occasion of the\r\nopening of the Suez Canal, De Lesseps was compared to Columbus, the\r\nopener of a way to the new world, so we may see the close of the\r\ngreat discoverer's career reflected in the tragic ending of the\r\nsplendid fortunes of De Lesseps.\r\n\r\nFerdinand de Lesseps was the son of a French gentleman who, fifty\r\nyears since, was in the Consular service of France in Egypt. He was\r\nborn at Versailles in 1805, and after receiving the usual education\r\ngiven to youth of his class, he was early inducted into the\r\nmysteries of diplomatic life, where his father's services and\r\ninfluence naturally opened a way for him. In 1833, when\r\ntwenty-eight, he was made consul at Cairo, and remained at that post\r\nfor over ten years, during which time he laid the foundations for\r\nthat knowledge of all matters connected with Egyptian affairs which\r\nwas to prove so valuable to him and to the world a few years later.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, De Lesseps was transferred from Cairo to Spain, and was\r\nmade consul at Barcelona. Spain was at this time much disturbed by\r\nfactional quarrels and jealousies, partly due to disputed claims to\r\nthe succession to the throne, and partly to the angry rivalries of\r\npolitical leaders, each eager to save the country by his particular\r\nnostrum. In the dynastic struggle, Queen Christina, made regent\r\nafter the death of her husband, Ferdinand VII., had been exiled to\r\nFrance, and General Espartero, who at first had stood for her cause,\r\nnow ruled as regent in her place. In 1843, the year after the\r\narrival of De Lesseps, the city of Barcelona, which in common with\r\nmany other places had refused to support Espartero, openly revolted,\r\nand was besieged and bombarded by his forces; and in the course of\r\nthe siege, which brought great misery upon the inhabitants, De\r\nLesseps did so many humane and generous acts at great personal risk,\r\nthat he was rewarded by honors from the governments of several\r\nnations whose subjects had been protected by him in his official\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that after this proof of his abilities, De Lesseps\r\nshould be advanced to a still higher position, and in the spring of\r\n1848 he was made minister to Madrid. This place he held, however,\r\nonly until February, 1849, for in May of that year he was sent to\r\nRome to patch up a peace between the popular party and the French\r\narmy of occupation. This proved an unfortunate venture. De Lesseps\r\nwas recalled to France in disgrace, in June of the same year, for\r\nhaving shown too great a sympathy for the party of Mazzini, which\r\naimed to establish a Roman Republic.\r\n\r\nIt may be conjectured that the disappointment of De Lesseps at this\r\nabrupt ending of his diplomatic career was not very great. He had\r\nnot been drawn to the profession by natural inclination, but had\r\ninherited it, so to speak, from his father, as another man might\r\ninherit the profession of law or medicine, or as the son of a\r\nmechanic might inherit his father's trade. His ambition and tastes\r\nboth led him in a different direction; he would play a more active,\r\na more striking part in the affairs of his time.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of his residence in Egypt, as consul for France,\r\nhe must often have heard the project of a canal across the Isthmus\r\nof Suez discussed, since the course of events was every year making\r\nthe necessity of the undertaking more evident. As is well known, the\r\nidea of such a canal was not a new one: Herodotus speaks of a canal\r\ndesigned and partly excavated by Pharaoh Necho in the seventh\r\ncentury before Christ, to connect the city of Bubastis, in the Delta\r\nof the Nile, with the Red Sea. As planned, the canal was to be ten\r\nfeet deep with a width sufficient for two triremes to pass abreast,\r\nand it was expected that the voyage would be accomplished in four\r\ndays. After the lives of 126,000 Egyptian workmen had been\r\nsacrificed to the hardships of the undertaking, Herodotus says that\r\nNecho, alarmed at the difficulties and expense, consulted the Oracle\r\nas to what was best for him to do, and received the answer: \"Thou\r\nart working for barbarians.\" The Egyptians, like the Greeks,\r\nconsidered all foreigners as barbarians, and the answer simply\r\nreflected the sentiment of the people, or of their leaders, that\r\nthis vast expenditure of labor, time, and money would prove to be,\r\nafter all, as much for the benefit of foreigners as for themselves.\r\nThe Oracle gave a voice to national and political prejudices, such\r\nas even in our own time are continually evoked to block the wheels\r\nof great enterprises. Necho, we are told, heeded the warning of the\r\nOracle and abandoned the enterprise, but about one hundred years\r\nlater, in the time of Darius Hystaspes, work on the canal was\r\nresumed and the undertaking was completed. From time to time we find\r\nmention made of the canal by later authors, but about the end of the\r\neighth century of our era it was finally abandoned and left to be\r\nblocked up by the sand.\r\n\r\nThe project was revived by Napoleon I. at the time of his Egyptian\r\nexpedition; but, on the report of his engineer, M. Lepère, now known\r\nto be mistaken, that the Red Sea level was thirty feet higher than\r\nthat of the Mediterranean, nothing further was done; nor was it\r\nuntil so late as 1847 that it was again taken up and an attempt made\r\nto interest the maritime powers of Europe in the scheme; but nothing\r\nserious was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the idea of a canal uniting the two seas, had up to this\r\ntime been largely sentimental, if we may so express it; rather\r\nconnected with vast schemes of conquest than founded on the vital\r\nneeds of commercial development and the material good of the people.\r\nThe commerce of the Mediterranean countries with India and the\r\nremoter East had not in those earlier times reached a point where\r\nsuch a costly undertaking as the Suez Canal could prove\r\nremunerative; what trade there was could be sufficiently and more\r\ncheaply accommodated by the Overland machinery of caravans, while\r\nFrance, Spain, and England still found the route by the Cape to\r\nanswer all their purposes. In fact it was more than doubtful whether\r\nsailing-vessels, by means of which trade was then chiefly carried\r\non, or even steamers of the build then employed, could use the canal\r\nto profit. It was believed that the advantages promised by a shorter\r\nroute would be counterbalanced by the delays and dangers reckoned\r\ninseparable from the navigation of so narrow a water-way.\r\n\r\nThese objections, really of a serious nature, made it difficult to\r\nwin over the business world to a practical interest in the scheme.\r\nDe Lesseps had been from the start the chief mover in the\r\nenterprise, to which he had given many years of his time, and he was\r\nnot a man to be discouraged by repeated failures to bring others to\r\nhis own way of thinking. His long experience, besides, in the ways\r\nof diplomacy had prepared him for delays and obstructions; but the\r\ntime came, at last, when his enthusiasm, his confidence in himself,\r\nand his skill in dealing with men were to bring about the\r\nrealization of his hopes.\r\n\r\nFive years, from 1849 to 1854, had been occupied by De Lesseps in\r\nnegotiations with governments and bankers, but it was not until 1854\r\nthat the event occurred which insured the success of his great\r\nundertaking. In that year, Mahomet Saïd Pasha became Viceroy of\r\nEgypt, and no sooner was he seated than he sent for De Lesseps to\r\nconsult with him as to the possibility of carrying out the project\r\nof the canal. In November of the same year, a commission was signed\r\nat Cairo by the Viceroy charging De Lesseps with the formation of a\r\ncompany to be named the United Suez Canal Company, with a capital of\r\ntwo hundred million francs, afterward raised to three hundred\r\nmillion. From this time the affairs of the canal went on with\r\ncomparative smoothness, and by 1858 the money necessary for the work\r\nhad been pledged; one-half the loan was placed on the continent,\r\nchiefly in Paris, the other half was taken by the Viceroy.\r\n\r\nActual work on the canal was begun in 1858 and such rapid progress was\r\nmade that it was completed in the autumn of 1869, and opened to the\r\ncommerce of the world with magnificent ceremonies, lasting for several\r\ndays. Religious ceremonies, in which priests of the Catholic Church,\r\nthe Greek Church, and the Moslem faith united, were followed by a\r\nnaval parade representing the European powers and the United States,\r\nand the whole concluded with a brilliant series of fêtes and\r\nentertainments at Cairo. As the originator of the canal, De Lesseps,\r\nwas a Frenchman, and as France had been the chief promoter of the\r\nenterprise, the place of honor at these ceremonies was naturally given\r\nto the Empress Eugénie, who went to Cairo as the representative of the\r\nFrench nation; while to De Lesseps, as naturally, was given the next\r\nplace, a position which he filled with equal dignity and modesty,\r\nwinning \"golden opinions from all sorts of people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal, though a vast and important undertaking, presented\r\nalmost no engineering difficulties to be overcome. At Port Saïd, the\r\nMediterranean entrance to the canal, two great piers, to serve as\r\nbreakwaters, were built of artificial stone, projecting into the\r\nsea; the western, a distance of 6,940 feet, the eastern 6,020 feet,\r\nand enclosing an area of 450 acres; thus providing a safe and\r\ncommodious harbor. At Suez, the Red Sea terminus of the canal, a\r\nless formidable defense was needed; but the necessary docks and\r\nbuildings called for a considerable outlay.\r\n\r\nFrom Port Saïd to Suez the land is almost a dead level; the few\r\nsand-dunes that break the monotonous uniformity of the isthmus\r\nnowhere reach a greater height than fifty or sixty feet. Along the\r\nmiddle line of the isthmus there was a series of depressions; some\r\nshallow, and others, the bottoms of which were lower than the level\r\nof the sea. Although these depressions were at all times dry, yet\r\nthey were called \"lakes,\" and as such figure on the maps, where we\r\nread the names \"Lake Timsah,\" \"The Bitter Lakes\" and others. They\r\nwere found to be thickly incrusted with salt on the bottom and\r\nsides, indicating that at one time they had been filled with\r\nsea-water; it is indeed must probable that the whole isthmus was at\r\na very remote period entirely submerged. In the construction of the\r\ncanal these depressions were made to play a very important part. The\r\nline of the canal was carried directly through them; the shallower\r\nwere brought to a sufficient depth by dredging; the deeper were\r\nsimply filled with water and required nothing more for safe\r\nnavigation than an indication of the channel by buoys. Thus, in the\r\nwhole length of the canal, reckoned at 88 geographical miles, there\r\nare 66 miles of actual digging; 14 miles of dredging through the\r\nlakes; and 8 miles, where neither digging nor dredging was required.\r\n\r\nWater began to flow from the Mediterranean into the canal in\r\nFebruary, 1869, and from the Red Sea in July of the same year; and\r\nby October, the lakes, and the canal in its whole length, were\r\nfilled with water navigable by vessels of the highest class. The\r\nwater-way thus obtained has a width at the surface varying from 197\r\nfeet at deep cuttings, to 225 feet at lower ground. The sides slope\r\nto a width at the bottom of 72 feet, and an average depth of 26 feet\r\nis secured along the whole course. As the water is at one level from\r\nsea to sea, the canal is without obstruction of any kind. No locks,\r\ndams, or water-gates are required, and vessels enter the canal from\r\neither end and pursue their journey without interruption or\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\nSo great, however, was the eagerness of trade to take advantage of\r\nthe new route, that the volume of traffic increased within a very\r\nshort time after the opening of the canal to such an extent as to\r\ncause serious delays in the transit, and a number of schemes were\r\nbrought forward for building other canals by which the two seas\r\nmight be united. In the end, all these plans were abandoned, and it\r\nwas decided to widen the canal sufficiently to enable it to meet the\r\nincreased demand upon its carrying capacity. It may not be without\r\ninterest to note the growth of traffic in the canal by a few\r\nfigures. From 486 ships which passed through in 1870, the number\r\nrose to 3,100 in 1886; while the receipts increased from $1,031,875\r\nin 1870, to $11,541,090 in 1886. The canal, when completed, was\r\nfound to have cost twenty million pounds sterling, a sum far in\r\nadvance of the original estimate, but made necessary by the addition\r\nof several important items of expenditure that were not foreseen.\r\nOne of these was the substitution of paid labor for the forced labor\r\npromised by the Pasha, but which was made impossible by public\r\nclamor. The Egyptian ruler discovered that he was not living in the\r\ntimes of the pyramid-building Pharaohs, when men were made\r\nbeasts-of-burden. Another item not provided for was the necessity of\r\nsupplying the 30,000 workmen employed on the canal with fresh water.\r\nFor this purpose, a branch canal had to be dug, by which water could\r\nbe brought from the Nile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cutting the Canal at Panama.]\r\n\r\nThe enterprise thus brought to a happy ending, has already proved of\r\ngreat service to the world. It must be looked upon not merely as a\r\nbenefit to commerce, but as one of the many powerful agents now\r\nat work binding the nations closer together. It is indissolubly\r\nconnected with the name of De Lesseps, and had he been contented\r\nwith the fortune and the reputation gained by his work in forwarding\r\nthe canal, few names would have shone brighter in the list of those\r\nwho have helped on man's material well-being. But in an evil hour he\r\nwas persuaded to lend his support to the Panama Canal scheme, and\r\nalong with the ruined fortunes and ruined reputations sunk in that\r\nabyss, the name and fortune of De Lesseps and his family have\r\nsuffered irretrievable blight.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal was not first proposed in our day; the scheme is as\r\nold as the discovery of the isthmus. \"The early navigators,\" says J.\r\nC. Rodrigues, \"could not help noticing how near to each other were\r\nthe two oceans, and how comparatively easy would be (they thought)\r\nthe cutting of a canal through that narrow strip of land between\r\nthem. The celebrated Portuguese navigator Antonio Galväo, as early\r\nas 1550, wrote an essay on the subject wherein he suggested four\r\ndifferent lines, one of which was through the Lake of Nicaragua, and\r\nanother by the Isthmus of Panama.\" England, in 1779, was the first\r\nto make an attempt to control the river and lake communications, but\r\nher forces sent under Nelson to begin the work were driven away by\r\nthe terrible fever that has thus far been the best defence of the\r\nisthmus from attack. Various schemes were entertained by other\r\nnations, but, although the United States kept a jealous eye upon its\r\nown interests in the enterprise, it was not until the discovery of\r\ngold in California that it saw a vital reason for insisting upon its\r\nparamount claims, and the outbreak of the Civil War, with its\r\nthreats of European intervention, made an easier communication with\r\nthe rising States of the Pacific Coast seem an absolute necessity.\r\nBut we moved slowly and with vacillating steps. We were divided in\r\nopinion as to the best route to take, as to the sort of canal that\r\nwas desirable, as to the advisability of building any canal. When\r\nthe war was over, the rapid increase of railroad communication with\r\nthe Pacific Coast made public opinion still more indifferent to the\r\nenterprise. Meanwhile the French had started with great energy a\r\nscheme for a canal at Panama, and De Lesseps had been induced to\r\nlend his name to the scheme, and to take an active part in carrying\r\nit out. For this purpose he visited the United States and used his\r\nbest diplomatic arts to induce our Government to unite with him in\r\nhis plans. But he could do nothing on this side the water and\r\nreturned to France to fight the battle alone. There the interest in\r\nthe scheme, artificially excited by speculators and still further\r\naided by the efforts of De Lesseps and his friends, increased to\r\nsuch an extent as to swamp all considerations of prudence. The name\r\nof De Lesseps, consecrated by the brilliant success of Suez, proved\r\nto be a powerful charm. Thousands and tens of thousands of people in\r\nthe cities and in the country put the hard-earned savings of years\r\ninto the venture; senators, deputies, men of high social rank in\r\npublic life, shamelessly sold their votes and their voices to secure\r\nthe moral aid and the money of the state to aid their gambling\r\nenterprise, and the newspaper press of Paris, at all times venal,\r\nbetrayed for bribes the trust that was reposed in it.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things could not last forever. The end, long\r\nprophesied, came at last; the exposure was complete, and the whole\r\nstupendous scheme of fraud was unmasked. Something might have been\r\nsaved from the wreck had the canal itself been a real thing so far\r\nas it had gone, a practical enterprise, sure in time to pay its\r\ninvestors and serve the public. But it was found that everything\r\nconnected with the construction of the canal had been grossly\r\nmisrepresented; the estimates of expense; the reports of the\r\nengineering difficulties to be overcome; the dangers from the\r\nclimate; the bills of mortality; everything, in short, was enveloped\r\nin a cloud of lies. So great was the shock to public confidence that\r\nfollowed this exposure, that for a time the Republic itself seemed\r\nin danger of overthrow. The eyes of the world were fixed upon De\r\nLesseps and his son Charles as the chief authors of the mischief,\r\nand when the crisis was passed, and the smoke of the upheaval had\r\npassed away, the Panama Canal was seen to be a ruined enterprise,\r\nand buried deep underneath it was the once-honored name of Ferdinand\r\nDe Lesseps.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Clarence Cook.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL JOHN C. FRÉMONT[17]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 17: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy JANE MARSH PARKER\r\n\r\n(1813-1890)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days of rapid transit between New York and San Francisco,\r\nof luxurious travel across desert and mountain, the story of John\r\nCharles Frémont, the Pathfinder of the great West, is of peculiar\r\ninterest, a striking illustration that the history of the world is\r\nin the biography of its leaders, in the pathfinders of the\r\nunexplored.\r\n\r\nThe stormy tide of the French Revolution sent the father of John\r\nCharles Frémont to the New World about the time, presumably, when\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte was in the height of power. This M. Frémont came\r\nof a good family living near Lyons, France. A British man-of-war\r\nmade prize of the ship in which he sailed for San Domingo, and he\r\nwas carried prisoner to one of the British West India islands, his\r\ncaptivity lasting several years. Upon gaining his liberty he stopped\r\nat Norfolk, Va., to refill an empty purse as a teacher of French,\r\nand there met Anne Beverly Whiting, a leading belle of an old\r\nVirginia family, who became his wife. One of the illustrious\r\nconnections of the Whitings was that with the family of George\r\nWashington. M. Frémont's marked fondness for travel and adventure\r\nwas shared by his wife. They took long journeys through the wild\r\nsouthern country, stopping at Indian villages, often sleeping by\r\ncamp-fires. On one of these expeditions, when making a halt at\r\nSavannah, Ga., John Charles, their first child, was born, January\r\n21, 1813. M. Frémont died a few years after.\r\n\r\nThe boyhood of John Charles was spent in Charleston. It is well to\r\nremember, in a study of his life, his French blood and early\r\nsouthern environment. His first choice of a profession was the law.\r\nAt the age of fourteen he became a student in the office of John W.\r\nMitchell, who placed him under a private tutor, Dr. Roberton, who\r\nunderstood the lad thoroughly and developed his character in the\r\nright direction. Dr. Roberton seems to have first discovered what\r\nwas made plain in Frémont's after-life--the makings of a poet, and\r\nthe foresight of a prophet. Translating the story of the battle of\r\nMarathon in the Greek class, young Frémont catches the spirit with\r\nwhich it was told by Herodotus, and writes verses in protest of\r\ntyranny which are published in one of the Charleston papers. \"In one\r\nyear,\" wrote his tutor, \"he had read four books of Cæsar; Cornelius\r\nNepos; Sallust; six books of Virgil; nearly all of Horace, and two\r\nbooks of Livy. In Greek--all of Græca Minora, about half of the\r\nfirst volume of Græca Majora, and four books of the Iliad.\" At\r\nfifteen he enters the junior class of Charleston College. At sixteen\r\nhe is confirmed in the Episcopal Church, entertaining at that time\r\nthoughts of entering the ministry. His steady progress is\r\ninterrupted by his first love affair; his absorbing passion so gets\r\nthe better of his common sense, that he neglects his books and\r\nclasses and is expelled from college. We next find him teaching\r\nhigher mathematics, acting as private tutor, and devoting his\r\nevenings to the charge of the _Apprentice's Library_, a school in\r\nCharleston. At twenty years of age he received the appointment of\r\nteacher of mathematics, and his long connection with the United\r\nStates Army had its beginning; his post the sloop of war Natchez. He\r\nwas to go on a cruise of two years and more along the coast of South\r\nAmerica. Here was a chance for him to unfit himself for further\r\nadvancement, but he improved his time upon the cruise to the utmost,\r\nand his diligent scholarship won for him the double degree of\r\nbachelor and master of arts from the college from which he had been\r\nexpelled. His application for a mathematical professorship in the\r\nNavy resulted in his passing the severe examination, and in an\r\nappointment to the frigate Independence. He declined the office,\r\nhowever, having decided to become an engineer, to join Captain\r\nWilliams's survey of the mountain passes between South Carolina and\r\nTennessee. There was talk of a railroad between Charleston and\r\nCincinnati in those days.\r\n\r\nThat was Frémont's first experience in exploring expeditions. The\r\ncorps lived chiefly in camp. The survey was in wild mountainous\r\nregions of the unexplored South, among Indians sullen against the\r\nGovernment. Frémont liked this kind of a life. He enlisted under\r\nCaptain Williams the second time in 1837, as assistant engineer,\r\ngoing with him upon a military reconnoissance of the Cherokee\r\ncountry in Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. A war cloud was\r\nrising; the peril of the expedition was its charm to Frémont. \"St.\r\nLouis was then on the border of an immense and almost unexplored\r\nIndian country. The caravans of merchandise going through it to\r\nSanta Fé, ran all the risks you can read of among Bedouins in the\r\ndesert; the hunters and trappers, as well as the merchants, started\r\noff into the unknown with only one certainty, that danger was there;\r\nand when they came back--if they ever did--it was as from\r\nunderworld.\"[18]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 18: Souvenirs of my Time. Jessie Benton Frémont.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time a distinguished French geographer, M. Nicollet, was\r\nsent to this country by France to explore the sources of the\r\nMississippi, \"in the interests of geography.\" The United States were\r\nalso interested in the geography of the almost unknown Northwest. M.\r\nNicollet was appointed to make explorations for the United States,\r\nand Frémont was honored with the position of principal assistant. It\r\nwas high time that something should be done in the interests of a\r\ngeography made up largely from travellers' tales. That there was a\r\ngreat river, the Buena Ventura, running from the base of the Rocky\r\nMountains to the Bay of San Francisco, nobody doubted, for there it\r\nwas upon the map. The exploration of M. Nicollet, assisted by\r\nFrémont, awakened great interest. They were absent two years; their\r\nfield, the territory between the Missouri and the upper rivers, as\r\nfar north as the British line. Their report was awaited with\r\nimpatience. Frémont came home to find that he had been appointed\r\nsecond lieutenant of the United States Topographical Engineers. As a\r\nscientific explorer his fame was established. The year following his\r\nreturn he spent in Washington with M. Nicollet, preparing his report\r\nfor publication. Among those most deeply interested was Senator\r\nBenton, of Missouri, \"Tom Benton,\" as he was popularly called, and\r\n\"Old Bullion.\" Benton's hobby was the opening of a road for\r\nimmigrants to the Pacific coast, as a necessary step to the\r\nacquisition of the territory held by Mexico--the California of\r\nto-day. Senator Benton's interest in the report of the young\r\nengineer, then about twenty-seven years of age, was surpassed by the\r\nyoung engineer's interest in the senator's daughter, Jessie, then\r\nonly fifteen, an interest which ended in a betrothal contrary to the\r\nwishes of older heads, owing to Miss Benton's youth and young\r\nFrémont's connection with the army. The young engineer received an\r\nunexpected and unwelcome order, sending him to the wild frontier of\r\nIowa at once, where the Sacs and Foxes, it was thought by Senator\r\nBenton (who had a hand in his exile), might be made to help postpone\r\nthe marriage, at least. But banishment and red-skins were of no\r\navail in breaking the engagement.\r\n\r\nFrémont performed his duty to the letter, returned to Washington,\r\nand married Miss Benton, October 19, 1841--a \"runaway match\" which\r\nhappily brought life-long happiness to both parties--Mrs. Frémont\r\nbecoming the connecting link, to use her own words, between her\r\nfather's \"fixed idea of the importance of the speedy acquisition of\r\nthe Pacific coast, and its actualization through the man best fitted\r\nto be the pioneer of the undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nLess than a year after his marriage, in the summer of 1842, Frémont\r\nwas sent by the War Department on the _first_ of the _five_\r\nexpeditions which gave him the name of Pathfinder.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican War was ripening fast. England had at that time\r\nfinancial claims upon Mexico, and Mexico was bankrupt.\r\n\r\nHow to get California was a serious question, reminding United\r\nStates diplomatists of the old Quaker's advice to his son--\"Get\r\nmoney, Joseph, get money. Get it honestly if you can--_but get it_.\"\r\nAcquisition of California by settlement was vigorously encouraged.\r\nThe best routes across the mountains must be discovered and\r\nsurveyed. Partial explorations of routes to Oregon and California\r\nhad been made. Emigrants had crossed the Rockies and were settled in\r\nthe Sacramento Valley. But the geography of the Great Basin was\r\ninaccessible to science; the best and safest routes were only\r\nguessed at. Emigration was checked by rumors of perils, alas! too\r\ntrue. Frémont's order to go to the frontier beyond the Mississippi,\r\nwas changed at his request for something more definite--the\r\nexploration of _the South Pass_ of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAugust 8, 1842, he reached the South Pass, and then the unexplored\r\nwas before him--untrodden ground. Kit Carson was his guide;\r\ntwenty-eight men made up his party--Canadian voyageurs, picked men,\r\nwell mounted and armed--only eight of the expedition driving wagons.\r\nRandolph Benton, a lad of twelve, Frémont's brother-in-law, was one\r\nof the number. The great event of this expedition, so full of\r\nthrilling adventure, was the first ascent of that highest peak of\r\nthe Wind River Mountains, now called Frémont's Peak, 13,570 feet in\r\nheight. \"We mounted the barometer in the snow of the summit,\"\r\nFrémont wrote, \"and fixing a ramrod in the crevice, unfurled the\r\nnational flag where never flag waved before.... While we were\r\nsitting on the rock a solitary bumble-bee came winging its flight\r\nfrom the eastern valley, and lit on the knee of one of the men.\"\r\nThey run a cañon in the Platte, singing a Canadian boat-song for all\r\nthe peril.... Their boat is whirled over, food, ammunition, and\r\nvaluable records lost. Climbing up and out of the cañon, they admire\r\nthe scenery in spite of their forlornity ... cacti and bare feet,\r\nhunger and thirst ... but astronomical and barometrical observations\r\nand drawings are made, botanical specimens collected, and a mass of\r\ninformation, making the report of this expedition[19] what has been\r\ncalled the most enduring monument of Frémont's fame. The report was\r\nhailed in England as well as the United States, and was followed by\r\nan increase of the wagon-trains across the mountains via the South\r\nPass.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 19: Frémont's Oregon and California. (1849.)]\r\n\r\nThe first expedition was absent some six months. Frémont's Peak\r\nmarks the western point of that journey.\r\n\r\nThe next order from the Government sent Frémont, in the spring of\r\n1843, to begin exploring where he had left off in 1842; to connect\r\nhis survey with that of Commodore Wilkes on the Pacific coast. Kit\r\nCarson was again his guide; many of the previous expedition\r\nenlisted, 32 men in all. Across the forks of the Kansas the route\r\nlay west of Fort Laramie, through the Medicine Butte Pass and the\r\nSouth Pass to the northern end of Great Salt Lake. Frémont's report\r\nof this region led the Mormons to settle at Salt Lake afterward,\r\nbelieving they would be in Mexican territory. The record of this\r\nexpedition, like the preceding one, is a story of fearful suffering\r\nand heroic endurance. It is given in detail in Frémont's \"Memoirs,\"\r\nand Benton's \"Thirty Years in the Senate.\" Deep snows on the\r\nmountains, no sign of the Buena Ventura River, Indians refusing to\r\nguide such a foolhardy venture; \"skeleton men leading skeleton\r\nhorses;\" the descent into the Sacramento Valley at last, and the\r\narrival at Fort Vancouver, November 1843, gives but a glimpse of the\r\nheroism of this second expedition. The suffering endured in reaching\r\nthe coast was as nothing to that of the return through the great\r\nvalley between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, looking for the\r\nriver they were the first to prove did not exist at all. From San\r\nFrancisco back to Salt Lake, three thousand five hundred miles in\r\neight months, not once out of the sight of snow. Geography had\r\ngained an important fact--the Colorado was the only river flowing\r\nfrom the Rocky Mountains on that part of the continent. For eight\r\nmonths not a word had been heard from the party, at the East, and\r\nthen Frémont came home \"thin as a shadow,\" and Mrs. Frémont could\r\ntell him that she might have prevented his going at all had she\r\nchosen, for an order from Washington, countermanding the expedition,\r\nhad been received by her addressed to her husband, soon after his\r\ndeparture from St. Louis. The expedition was not too far away when\r\nthe despatch came for her to get it to him, but she decided to\r\nwithhold it. Because he had taken a mountain howitzer in his outfit\r\nhe was ordered to stay at home. What a scientific expedition could\r\nwant of a howitzer was not plain to the authorities, who seemed to\r\nthink that hostile Indians knew at sight the difference between a\r\nmilitary and a scientific party and would respect it. Mrs. Frémont\r\ntells the story in _The Century_ for March, 1891, how she not only\r\ndid not send on the despatch, but a messenger instead, bidding\r\nFrémont \"Go on at once without asking why,\" so fearful was she a\r\nduplicate order might defeat his going at all.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott was Commander in Chief of our Army in 1845. At his\r\ninstance Lieutenant Frémont was made captain in the United States\r\nArmy, and in the fall of that year was sent by the Government on\r\nanother expedition ... this time to find the best road to the\r\nPacific coast. Trouble with Mexico was growing fast. Our\r\nsouthwestern territory needed looking after; the northwestern of\r\nMexico as well. Frémont was to follow the Arkansas River to its\r\nsource in the Rocky Mountains, explore the Great Basin, the\r\nCascades, and the Sierra Nevada, and define a route in a southern\r\nlatitude for emigrants. Kit Carson was among the sixty men of this\r\nparty, and several veterans of the two former expeditions. They\r\nstruck out for the Sierra by the way of the Humboldt River. The war\r\nwith Mexico broke out soon after their departure.\r\n\r\nIt was another story of fearful hardship--the Sacramento Valley was\r\nreached at last, and Frémont hastened to Monterey to get permission\r\nfrom the Mexican authorities to make a scientific exploration of the\r\nregion. His request was granted, and permission given to replenish\r\nhis exhausted supplies. Why the Government revoked this permission\r\nalmost as soon as granted, ordering him and his men to quit the\r\ncountry at once or they would be sent as prisoners to Mexico, is a\r\nsource of much controversy between historians of that day and this.\r\nFrémont could not retreat into the desert with his scanty outfit. A\r\nrude fort was built at once on Hawk's Peak, some thirty miles from\r\nMonterey, and the Stars and Stripes flung out, Frémont and his men\r\nready to take the consequences of such defiance. When they withdrew,\r\nas they did in a few days, overtures from the Mexicans followed\r\nthem, even a proposition from the Spanish officer that Frémont\r\nshould join with him and declare the country independent of Mexico.\r\nFrémont moved northward. He had reached Tlamath Lake when overtaken\r\nby a special messenger from Washington, the bearer of a despatch\r\nwhich had been memorized by the messenger to prevent its falling\r\ninto the hands of the Mexicans, and which Frémont interpreted to\r\nmean that it was the wish of the Cabinet that he should aid in\r\ntaking and holding California, in the event of any occurrence which\r\nhe thought justification for so doing. The English must not\r\nstrengthen their foothold on the coast. Someone must look after the\r\ninterest of the United States; he was on the ground. If a crisis\r\ncame he must act without written authority, promptly and\r\ndiscreetly--\"Get it honestly if you can--_but get it_.\" He returned\r\nat once to California, and found it in a revolutionary state. The\r\nAmerican settlers had hoisted what was called the Bear Flag, and\r\nwere eager to fight for the overthrow of the Mexican authority in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIt is a long story, that of the conquest of California. Frémont's\r\nright to be called the Conqueror or the Emancipator is bitterly\r\ndisputed by some, who claim that he attacked the Californians by\r\nirregular warfare, and so thwarted the conciliatory designs of the\r\nGovernment. Be that as it may, by July 5, 1846, the Bear Flag\r\ninsurgents under Frémont had declared their independence of Mexico,\r\nand Frémont had been appointed Governor of California, and had\r\nhauled down the Bear Flag and raised the Stars and Stripes. A\r\nconstitution had been drawn up and the territory declared to be in\r\nthe possession of the United States. January, 1847, \"the enemy\"\r\ncapitulated to Frémont. \"The celerity and boldness of his movements\r\nin the conduct of the affair were only surpassed,\" says a\r\ncontemporary, \"by the moderation and clemency of his policy.\" \"The\r\ndecisive point,\" wrote George Bancroft, \"in the establishment of the\r\nUnion on a firm basis had been gained.\"\r\n\r\nThe seizure of California in 1846 has been called, from another\r\noutlook, \"one of the least creditable affairs in the highly\r\ndiscreditable Mexican War,\" and Frémont nothing more than a\r\nfilibuster seeking private ends. California had been made ours,\r\nnevertheless, and Frémont had secured the prize.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Mexican War had begun, and Commodore Stockton,\r\nof the U. S. Navy, was hastening to California _by sea_ under orders\r\nto subjugate the country. General Kearney was marching westward _by\r\nland_ under like orders. Of course there was a dispute about\r\nprecedence when both were upon the ground, each asserting his right\r\nto command the other, both issuing orders and insisting upon the\r\nright to precedence. The difficulty of serving under two masters was\r\nexperienced by Frémont. General Vallejo testified that he received\r\nin one day, letters from Commodore Stockton, General Kearney, and\r\nColonel Frémont, each signing himself \"Commander-in-Chief.\" Frémont\r\nbelieved he had sufficient reason for choosing to serve under\r\nStockton, which he did. Upon Stockton's return to his squadron and\r\nKearney's assignment to full command, Kearney brought charges\r\nagainst Frémont for mutiny and fraud, defeating his re-appointment\r\nas governor of the State besides. Frémont was ordered home, and it\r\nwas said \"that, like Columbus, he returned from the discovery and\r\nconquest of a new world, a prisoner and in disgrace.\" He went back\r\nto Washington under arrest. Great honors awaited him, nevertheless,\r\nhis troubles only adding to his laurels. The citizens of Charleston\r\ngave him a sword, the ladies the gold-mounted belt of the same. He\r\ndemanded immediate trial, which was granted, the court-martial\r\nlasting three months, his defence filling three sessions. He was\r\npronounced guilty of mutiny, disobedience of the lawful command of a\r\nsuperior officer, and conduct to the prejudice of good order and\r\nmilitary discipline--a conviction based, some said, upon technical\r\ngrounds. President Polk remitted the penalty--dismissal from the\r\narmy--but Frémont resigned at once, the President reluctantly\r\naccepting his resignation.\r\n\r\nFrémont was then thirty-four years old. As the leader of three great\r\nexploring expeditions he had become not only famous, but a popular\r\nhero. He had done much for science. He had made the most accurate\r\nmap of the region between the one hundred and fourth meridian and\r\nthe Pacific. He had added a large collection of botanical,\r\ngeological, and other specimens to the national museums. He was\r\neager to resume explorations of routes to the Pacific, having\r\ndecided to settle his family in California--upon the Mariposa\r\nestate, in the Sacramento Valley, which he had bought in 1847,\r\nbefore the discovery of gold, seventy square miles, for $3,000, \"the\r\nonly Mexican grant that covered any part of the gold regions.\"\r\n\r\nFrémont's claims against the Government for expenses incurred in the\r\nconquest and defence of California, amounted to some $700,000, which\r\nwas paid to him. Among those advocating the payment were Senators\r\nBenton, and Dix of New York. Twenty thousand copies of Frémont's map\r\nof Oregon and California were ordered by the Senate.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means in the rôle of a defeated man that he started out\r\nupon his fourth expedition, in the fall of 1848--when the gold fever\r\nwas at its height--a venture of his own and Colonel Benton's; its\r\nobject, a route to the Pacific by way of the Rio Grande. Thirty-two\r\nmen were enlisted, picked men as before. It was a superb and costly\r\noutfit, no less than one hundred and twenty mules. Lacking Kit\r\nCarson for a guide, they were lost in crossing the Rocky Mountains,\r\nevery mule and horse and one-third of the men perishing from cold or\r\nstarvation. At last, as he wrote home, \"the mules, huddled together\r\nin the deep snow, froze stiff as they stood and fell over like\r\nblocks.\" The freezing men recrossed the summit in retreat, some of\r\nthem driven to cannibalism. Wading through the snow to the waist,\r\nthe remnant reached the home of Kit Carson at Taos, N. M., where\r\nFrémont reorganized the expedition, reaching the Sacramento in the\r\nspring of 1849.\r\n\r\nLitigation concerning his title to the Mariposa estate did not\r\nprevent Frémont from developing its mineral and agricultural\r\nresources. He engaged some twenty-eight Spaniards to work its gold\r\nmines upon shares. His prospects of boundless wealth were most\r\nflattering. The Pathfinder was now a millionaire, and in 1855 his\r\ntitle to Mariposa was established by the Supreme Court. Following\r\nhis appointment in 1849 to run the boundary line between the United\r\nStates and Mexico, the political party of the Territory seeking its\r\nadmission as a free State, elected him to the United States Senate.\r\nMany honors were bestowed upon him at this time--the medal of the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society of London, the Founders medal from the\r\nKing of Prussia, an honorary membership of the Geographical Society\r\nof Berlin, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the California State election of 1851, Frémont stood with the\r\nAnti-Slavery party, opposed to the extension of slavery in free\r\nterritories. He was defeated, and went to Europe with his family in\r\n1852, where he was fêted by royalty generally. Mrs. Frémont, in her\r\n\"Souvenirs of My Time,\" has given charming glimpses of this part of\r\ntheir life. Hearing that Congress had made appropriation for further\r\nsurveys of great Western routes, Frémont hastened home in 1853, to\r\nexplore by a fifth expedition, what he believed to be the most\r\ncentral and practicable route. This was his second private venture.\r\nHe would follow the path he had lost when the guide led him astray\r\non his fourth expedition. He would cross the Rockies at Cochetopa\r\nPass, and that in winter.\r\n\r\nHe made the passage, but it was at the cost of frightful suffering;\r\nfifty days on frozen horse-flesh, days without even that;\r\nforty-eight hours without a morsel of food; the entire party\r\nbarefooted in the snow; Frémont, in the hour of extreme peril on the\r\nstorm-swept mountain-side, making his men take oath that, come what\r\nmight, nothing should tempt them to cannibalism. Benton tells us how\r\nFrémont went straight to the spot where the guide had gone astray in\r\n1848, and found safe and easy passes all the way to California, upon\r\nthe straight line of 38° and 39°. Great railroads of to-day follow\r\nthe line it took those starving and half-frozen men fifty days to\r\npass in that winter of 1854. For three months nothing was heard from\r\nthe party. Frémont's arrival in San Francisco was an ovation.\r\n\"Europe lies between Asia and America,\" we read in his report;\r\n\"build the road, and America lies between Europe and Asia.... The\r\niron track to San Francisco will be the thoroughfare of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe issues at stake in the presidential campaign of 1856 make that\r\ncampaign the most important of any in the history of our country.\r\n\"The question now to be decided,\" said Seward, \"is whether a\r\nslave-holding class shall govern America or not.\" The nomination of\r\nJohn Charles Frémont as the candidate of the Republican party was\r\nhailed with enthusiasm at the North. The Civil War was impending.\r\nThe lines between the defenders of slavery and its opponents were\r\nsharply defined. Frémont was the first nominee of the Republican\r\nparty. The romance and adventure of his career, his upright life,\r\nthe hero-worship of the Pacific coast, the antagonism of the South,\r\ngave the canvass a vitalizing force that his defeat by James\r\nBuchanan did not lessen, but simply changed into a new phase of\r\nstrength. Frémont's popular vote was 1,341,000 against 1,838,000 for\r\nBuchanan and 874,000 for Fillmore (Know-Nothing). Frémont received\r\n114 electoral votes, and Buchanan 174.\r\n\r\nWhen the Civil War broke out, in 1861, Frémont was in Europe. He\r\noffered his services to the Government at once, and was appointed\r\none of the four major-generals of the regular army, and given his\r\nchoice of a command at the East or the West. He chose the West. \"Who\r\nholds the Mississippi will hold the country by the heart,\" he said.\r\nHis head-quarters were at St. Louis, where secession was rampant.\r\n\"You must use your own judgment,\" wrote President Lincoln, \"and do\r\nthe best you can. I doubt if the States will ever come back.\"\r\nFrémont's policy differed from Lincoln's essentially; it lacked that\r\npatient, conciliatory spirit with the South which made it hard for\r\nmany at the North to approve of the compromising policy of the Chief\r\nExecutive, seeking to hold the neutral States from seceding.\r\nFrémont's hatred of the rebellion led him to deal with it just as he\r\nwould have done with a mutiny on a perilous expedition. He\r\nproclaimed martial law. Rebels were to pay some penalty for\r\nrebellion--rebel newspapers were silenced--and what was the notable\r\nfeature of Frémont's administration--the slaves of those in arms\r\nagainst the Government were declared emancipated; his emancipation\r\nproclamation antedating Lincoln's of September 22, 1862, by a little\r\nmore than a year. But Frémont's policy was censured rather than\r\napproved by the country at large. Petty intrigues of officers in\r\nclose relation with the Cabinet did much to defeat his plans. His\r\nfleet of gunboats was called a useless extravagance--his staff \"the\r\nCalifornia Gang.\" His emancipation proclamation was pronounced\r\npremature and unwise by Lincoln, and revoked. Frémont again was the\r\ncause of an intense public partisanship, \"Frémont's career at the\r\nWest was brief,\" says \"Patton's Concise History of the United\r\nStates,\" \"only one hundred days; but, being a man of military\r\ninstincts and training, he showed in that time a sagacity which was\r\nnot allowed fair practical development. In that brief time he was\r\nthe first to suggest and inaugurate the following practices, then\r\nwidely decried, but without which the war would not have been\r\nsuccessfully concluded: the free use of cavalry (strongly opposed by\r\nGeneral Scott and others); exchange of prisoners with the enemy;\r\nfortification of large cities, to allow armies to take the field;\r\nbuilding of river gunboats for the interior operations at the West;\r\nand the emancipation of the slaves. In short, he contributed more\r\nthan is generally credited to him.\" \"To get rid of Frémont,\" says\r\nMajor-General Sigel, \"the good prospects and honor of the army were\r\nsacrificed to the jealousy of successful rivals.\" Frémont was\r\nrelieved of his command in 1861, and shortly after appointed\r\ncommander of the Mountain District of Virginia, Kentucky, and\r\nTennessee, where he did most honorable service, Stonewall Jackson\r\nretreating before him after eight days' sharp skirmishing, ending in\r\nthe battle of Cross Keys.\r\n\r\nUpon the appointment of General Pope as Commander of the Army of\r\nVirginia, making him Frémont's superior officer, Frémont asked to be\r\nrelieved; his request was granted.\r\n\r\nA minority of the Republican party, the radical wing, opposed to the\r\nrenomination of Lincoln in 1864, nominated Frémont as their\r\ncandidate. He accepted, but finally withdrew. \"Not to aid in the\r\ntriumph of Lincoln,\" he said, \"but to do my part toward preventing\r\nthe election of the Democratic candidate.\" One of the Republican\r\ncandidates would have to retire to save the party. Here is a subject\r\nfor debating clubs: Was the interest of the country best served by\r\nFrémont's withdrawal from the canvass of 1864?\r\n\r\nAfter 1864 Frémont took little part in public life. He became\r\nabsorbed in his great trans-continental railroad scheme of a line\r\nfrom Norfolk to San Diego and San Francisco, in which he ultimately\r\nlost his large fortune. French agents, in disposing of his bonds in\r\nFrance, made false representations. He was prosecuted by the French\r\nGovernment in 1873, and sentenced by default to fine and\r\nimprisonment, although no judgment was given on the merits of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe sale of his Mariposa grant brought him several millions, which\r\nhe invested in railroads soon after the war, buying the properties\r\nthat now constitute a large part of the Texas Pacific and other\r\nroads belonging to the Atchison and Santa Fé. In the great\r\nconsolidation entailed by the foreign litigation, his confidence was\r\nabused, and he met with heavy and irreparable loss.\r\n\r\nFrom 1878 to 1881 he was Governor of Arizona. His \"Memoirs\" appeared\r\nin 1886. The closing years of his life were spent in comparative\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nNot long before his sudden death in New York City July 14, 1890, at\r\nthe age of seventy-seven years, he had been placed on the retired\r\nlist of the United States Army with the rank of Major-General. When\r\nhe passed away the Pathfinder of Africa was filling the public\r\near--the wedding of Stanley in Westminster Abbey was the theme of\r\nthe hour.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in Kensico Cemetery, Piermont-on-the-Hudson, about\r\nthirty miles from New York City, near the country home of his\r\nprosperous days. His widow, Jessie Benton Frémont, is at this\r\nwriting (1893), a resident of Los Angeles, Cal. Three children\r\nsurvive their father, an unmarried daughter, Elizabeth McDowell\r\nBenton, Lieutenant Frank Preston Frémont, U. S. A.; and Lieutenant\r\nJohn Charles Frémont, U. S. N. After his death Mrs. Frémont demanded\r\ncompensation for, or restitution of the property appropriated by the\r\nUnited States Government for military purposes in San Francisco\r\nharbor, in 1863, and for which she has never received a dollar\r\n(1893). The settlement of this claim in her favor is anticipated by\r\nthe bench generally, long as justice to her has been delayed. At\r\npresent she has a pension from the Government.\r\n\r\nSome profess to find it hard reading the character of John Charles\r\nFrémont, calling it enigmatical and baffling. Not so with those who\r\nknew him best. \"His unwritten history,\" writes one of these, \"gives\r\nthe clew to his life.\"\r\n\r\nThat he was a man of indomitable courage none can deny; a man of\r\nlofty principle and unblemished character. An atmosphere of romance\r\nmakes him the American Chevalier.\r\n\r\nHe did more than any other man to open the pathways to the Pacific\r\ncoast. The bitter feeling engendered by the California conquest, and\r\nhis policy in the Civil War, is not yet extinct. Partisanship has\r\nbiassed the most of his biographers. The intense feeling underlying\r\nthe presidential campaign of 1856 did not conduce to a fair estimate\r\nof the man, who has suffered hardly less from the intense admiration\r\nof his friends than from jealousies of rivals and foes. \"I tried to\r\ndo my duty,\" he would say in his old age, when asked to explain\r\nknotty points about the conquest.\r\n\r\n\"All that he ever did for the Government,\" says one who knew him\r\nwell, \"was uniformly repaid with injury.\" That is the verdict of one\r\nside of the controversy. The sifting and weighing of a mass of\r\nconflicting evidence, preceding the final verdict of permanent\r\nhistory, is not yet ended in Frémont's case. That the outcome will\r\nbe illumination of his fame rather than obscuration, his unswerving\r\ndefenders do not doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Though the Pathfinders die, the paths remain open.\"\r\n\r\n[Signature: Jane Marsh Parker.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID LIVINGSTONE\r\n\r\nBy Professor W. G. BLAIKIE, LL.D.\r\n\r\n(1813-1873)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: David Livingstone.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Livingstone, missionary and traveller, was born at Blantyre,\r\nin Lanarkshire, March 19, 1813. His parents, who were in humble\r\nlife, were of devout and exemplary character; his father in\r\nparticular being a great reader, especially of travels and\r\nmissionary intelligence, and much interested in the enterprise of\r\nthe nineteenth century. At the age of ten David became a worker in a\r\ncotton-factory at Blantyre, and continued in that laborious\r\noccupation for fourteen years. His thirst for knowledge led him to\r\nread all that he could lay his hands on; he used also to attend a\r\nnight-class, after the long hours of the factory, for the study of\r\nLatin. The reading of Dick's \"Philosophy of a Future State\" was not\r\nonly the means of a profound impression on his mind, but kindled the\r\ndesire to devote his life as a missionary to the service of Christ.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the advantages of medical training to a\r\nmissionary, he resolved to qualify himself in medicine, as well as\r\nthe other attainments looked for in a missionary. The London\r\nMissionary Society having accepted the offer of his services, he\r\nwent to London to complete his studies. His first desire was to\r\nlabor in China, but, war having broken out between that country and\r\nGreat Britain, this wish could not be fulfilled. The Rev. Robert\r\nMoffat's visit at this time to England turned many hearts to\r\nAfrica--Livingstone's among the rest; ultimately he was appointed to\r\nthat field, and, having been ordained on November 20, 1840, he set\r\nsail for Africa, reaching Lattakoo or Kuruman, Moffat's settlement,\r\non July 31, 1841.\r\n\r\nFor several years Livingstone labored as a missionary in the\r\nBechuana country, at Mabotse, Chonuana, and Kolobeng, places that\r\nwere chosen by him just because they were in the heart of\r\nheathenism. The conversion of Sechélé, chief of the Bakwains, and\r\nseveral of his tribe, was a great encouragement. Repulsed by the\r\nBoers in an effort to plant native missionaries in the Transvaal, he\r\ndirected his steps northward, discovered Lake 'Ngami and found the\r\ncountry there traversed by fine rivers and inhabited by a dense\r\npopulation. His anxiety to benefit this region led finally to his\r\nundertaking to explore the whole country westward to the Atlantic at\r\nSt. Paul de Loanda, and eastward to the Indian Ocean at Quilimane.\r\n\r\nLivingstone had married at Mabotse, Mary, eldest daughter of the\r\nRev. R. Moffat, and now he found it necessary to send her, with\r\ntheir children, to England, that he might be free for this vast and\r\nperilous undertaking. To accomplish it occupied from June 8, 1852,\r\nwhen he left Cape Town, to May 26, 1856, when he arrived at\r\nQuilimane. This journey was accomplished with a mere handful of\r\nfollowers, and a mere pittance of stores, amid sicknesses and other\r\nbodily troubles, perils, and difficulties without number. But a vast\r\namount of valuable information was gathered respecting the country\r\nand its products, its geography and natural history, the native\r\ntribes, the regions that were favorable to health, and some great\r\nnatural wonders, such as the Zambesi Falls.\r\n\r\nLivingstone, however, found that the London Missionary Society were\r\nnot willing that he should be to so large an extent an explorer, and\r\nsome time after returning to Britain he resigned his office as one\r\nof their missionaries.\r\n\r\nAt home Livingstone was welcomed with extraordinary enthusiasm,\r\nreceiving the acknowledgments and honors of scientific societies,\r\nuniversities, town councils, and other public bodies in every\r\nquarter of the country. In addition to these tokens of honor, the\r\nfifteen months spent at home were signalized by three things: the\r\nwriting of his book, \"Missionary Travels\" (1857), which was received\r\nwith the liveliest interest; his visit to Cambridge, awakening the\r\nenthusiasm of many of the students, and leading to the formation\r\nafterward of the \"Universities Mission;\" and his appointment by Her\r\nMajesty's Government as chief of an expedition for exploring the\r\nZambesi and its tributaries, and the regions adjacent.\r\n\r\nOn this expedition Livingstone set out on March 10, 1858. While\r\nsuccessful in many ways, it led to not a little disappointment.\r\nLivingstone explored the Zambesi, the Shiré, and the Rovuma;\r\ndiscovered Lakes Shirwa and Nyassa, and came to a decided conclusion\r\nthat Lake Nyassa and its neighborhood was the best field for both\r\ncommercial and missionary operations. His disappointments arose from\r\nthe grievous defects of a steamer sent out to him by Government,\r\nfrom the death of comrades and helpers, including his wife and\r\nBishop Mackenzie; from the abandonment of the Universities Mission;\r\nfrom the opposition of the Portuguese authorities; but mainly from\r\nthe distressing discovery that, encouraged by Portuguese traders,\r\nthe slave-trade was extending in the district, and the slave-traders\r\nusing his very discoveries to facilitate their infamous traffic. At\r\nlength a despatch recalling the expedition was received, July 2,\r\n1863. Livingstone, at his own cost, had brought out a new steamer,\r\nbut she could not be put on the lake. Depressed though he was, he\r\nexplored the northern banks of Lake Nyassa on foot; then in his own\r\nvessel, and under his own seamanship, crossed the Indian Ocean to\r\nBombay; and after a brief stay there, returned to Britain, reaching\r\nLondon on July 23, 1864.\r\n\r\nAt home Livingstone had two objects--to expose the atrocious deeds\r\nof the Portuguese slave-traders, and to find means of establishing a\r\nsettlement for missions and commerce somewhere near the head of the\r\nRovuma, or wherever a suitable locality could be found. His second\r\nbook, \"The Zambesi and its Tributaries\" (1865), was designed to\r\nfurther these objects. He was again received with every\r\ndemonstration of honor and regard. A proposal was made to him, on\r\nthe part of the Royal Geographical Society, to return to Africa and\r\nsettle a disputed question regarding the water-shed of Central\r\nAfrica and the sources of the Nile. He said he would go only as a\r\nmissionary, but was willing to help to solve the geographical\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nHe set out in August, 1865, _via_ Bombay and Zanzibar. On March 19,\r\n1866, he started from the latter place, first of all trying to find\r\na suitable settlement, then striking westward in order to solve the\r\ngeographical problem. Through the ill-behavior of some of his\r\nattendants a report of his death was circulated, but an expedition,\r\nheaded by Mr. E. D. Young, R. N., ascertained that the report was\r\nfalse. Livingstone pressed westward amid innumerable hardships, and\r\nin 1869 discovered Lakes Meoro and Bangweolo. All the while he was\r\ndoing what he could for the religious enlightenment of the natives.\r\nObliged to return for rest to Ujiji, where he found his goods\r\nsquandered, he struck westward again as far as the river Lualaba,\r\nthinking it might possibly be the Nile, but far from certain that it\r\nwas not, what it proved afterward to be, the Congo. Returning after\r\nsevere illness once more to Ujiji, Livingstone found there, Mr. H.\r\nM. Stanley, who had been sent to look for him by the proprietor of\r\nthe _New York Herald_. But no consideration would induce him to\r\nreturn home till he had made one more effort to solve the\r\ngeographical problem.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Lake Bangweolo, but fell into wretched health. His\r\nsufferings always increasing, when he reached Chitambo's village in\r\nIlala, he was obliged to give in. On the morning of May 1, 1873, he\r\nwas found by his attendants on his knees, dead. His faithful people\r\nembalmed his body as best they could, carried it amid the greatest\r\nperils to the shore, where it was put on board a British cruiser,\r\nand on April 18, 1874, it was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nAmong the remains brought home were his \"Last Journals,\" brought\r\ndown to within a few days of his death; these were published in\r\n1874. Stanley suggested the name of Livingstone for the main stream\r\nof the Congo (hence the Baptist Mission on the Lower Congo was\r\ncalled the \"Livingstone Inland Mission\"), and Mr. H. H. Johnston\r\nproposed that part of the East African territory acquired by Britain\r\nin 1890--the lower drainage area of the Zambesi--should be called\r\nLivingstone Land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written by him to his children in 1853, during\r\nhis first exploring tour, gives the character of the man, and shows\r\nhis deep religious feeling:\r\n\r\n\"_Sekelétu's Town, Linyanti, 2d October._--My dear Robert, Agnes,\r\nand Thomas and Oswell.--Here is another little letter for you all. I\r\nshould like to see you much more than write to you, and speak with\r\nmy tongue rather than with my pen, but we are far from each\r\nother--very, very far. Here are Scipone, and Meriye, and others who\r\nsaw you as the first white children they ever looked at. Meriye came\r\nthe other day and brought a round basket for Nannie. She made it of\r\nthe leaves of the palmyra. Others put me in mind of you all by\r\ncalling me Rananee, Rarobert, and there is a little Thomas in the\r\ntown, and when I think of you I remember, though I am far off,\r\nJesus, our good and gracious Jesus, is ever near both you and me,\r\nand then I pray to Him to bless you and make you good.\r\n\r\n\"He is ever near. Remember this if you feel angry or naughty. Jesus\r\nis near you, and sees you, and He is so good and kind. When He was\r\namong men, those who heard him speak said, 'Never man spake like\r\nthis man,' and we now say, 'Never did man love like Him.' You see\r\nlittle Zouga is carried on mamma's bosom. You are taken care of by\r\nJesus with as much care as mamma takes care of Zouga. He is always\r\nwatching you and keeping you in safety. It is very bad to sin, to do\r\nany naughty things, or speak angry or naughty words before Him.\r\n\r\n\"My dear children, take Him as your Guide, your Helper, your Friend,\r\nand Saviour through life. Whatever you are troubled about, ask Him\r\nto keep you. Our God is good. We thank Him that we have such a\r\nSaviour and Friend as He is. Now you are little, but you will not\r\nalways be so, hence you must learn to read, and write, and work. All\r\nclever men can both read and write, and Jesus needs clever men to do\r\nHis work. Would you not like to work for Him among men? Jesus is\r\nwishing to send His gospel to all nations, and He needs clever men\r\nto do this. Would you like to serve Him? Well, you must learn now,\r\nand not get tired learning. After some time you will like learning\r\nbetter than playing, but you must play too in order to make your\r\nbodies strong and be able to serve Jesus.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear that you go to the academy. I hope you are\r\nlearning fast. Don't speak Scotch. It is not so pretty as English.\r\nIs the Tau learning to read with mamma? I hope you are all kind to\r\nmamma. I saw a poor woman in a chain with many others, up at the\r\nBarotse. She had a little child, and both she and her child were\r\nvery thin. See how kind Jesus was to you. No one can put you in\r\nchains unless you become bad. If, however, you learn bad ways,\r\nbeginning only by saying bad words or doing little bad things, Satan\r\nwill have you in chains for sin, and you will be hurried on in his\r\nbad ways till you are put into the dreadful place which God hath\r\nprepared for him and all who are like him. Pray to Jesus to deliver\r\nyou from sin, give you new hearts, and make you His children. Kiss\r\nZouga, mamma, and each other for me.\r\n\r\n                              \"Your ever affectionate father.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYRUS W. FIELD[20]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 20: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy MURAT HALSTEAD\r\n\r\n(1819-1892)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cyrus W. Field.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, the people of the United States, have been celebrating with\r\nmemorable pomp the discovery of our hemisphere by Christopher\r\nColumbus, and the elder nations and far-off islands have joined us\r\nin an immense festivity, honoring beyond all example of approbation\r\nan adventure that was a marvel, and an achievement that is immortal.\r\n\r\nAll the world remembers the voyage of Columbus, that, persevered in\r\nthrough trials and perils, ended in triumph--how he studied the\r\nstars and the charts, and out of the dreams of ages wove the fabric\r\nof fancy that grew to theory, and prophecy, and history, that there\r\nwas land beyond the Atlantic; and there is no moment in human life\r\nsupreme above, or of more fascinating interest than, that when, from\r\nthe deck of his caravel he saw the light on the shore of the new\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAn incident worthy to be associated for ever with this, is that of\r\nCyrus West Field, in his library, turning over a globe, after a\r\nconversation relative to extending a line of telegraph to\r\nNewfoundland, to reduce the time of the transmission of news between\r\nEurope and America; when the idea flashed into his mind that the\r\ntelegraph might span the Atlantic. The next day Mr. Field wrote to\r\nLieutenant Maury, of the National Observatory at Washington, and to\r\nProfessor Morse, who invented the telegraph.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic telegraph was as truly the conception and the\r\naccomplishment of Mr. Field, as the discovery of America was the\r\nambition and the act of Columbus; and Chief Justice Chase was not\r\nextravagant when he said the telegraph across the ocean was \"the\r\nmost wonderful achievement of civilization,\" and entitled \"its\r\nauthor to a distinguished rank among benefactors;\" or when he added:\r\n\"High upon that illustrious roll will his name be placed, and there\r\nwill it remain while oceans divide and telegraphs unite mankind.\"\r\nJohn Bright said: \"My friend Field, the Columbus of modern times, by\r\nhis cable has moored the New World alongside the Old.\"\r\n\r\nEqually lofty testimony to the splendor of his fame is that of the\r\nLondon _Times_ of August 6, 1858, saying: \"Since the discovery of\r\nColumbus, nothing has been done in any degree comparable to the vast\r\nenlargement which has thus been given to the sphere of human\r\nactivity.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first vital spark that at last glows into the bloom of\r\nlife, each human being is endowed with certain qualities and\r\ncapacities, aptitudes, inspirations, possibilities, limitations; and\r\nif one trace the stream of blood to its remotest sources, there is\r\nno inconsistency in ancestry, and the science of humanity may be as\r\nstrict within its boundaries as that of geology, or the story of\r\nfruitful trees, or the magnetic constellations.\r\n\r\nThe four famous brothers have given the Field family an almost\r\nunique celebrity in this country. They were the sons of the Rev.\r\nDavid Dudley Field, of Western Massachusetts, the room-mate at Yale\r\nCollege of Jeremiah Evarts, father of William M. Evarts. Field and\r\nEvarts entered college together in 1798, and graduated in 1802. The\r\nAmerican Fields are the descendants of John Field, the astronomer of\r\nArdsley, in Yorkshire, who gained a great reputation by publishing\r\nastronomical tables, and died in 1587. Ardsley, it has not passed\r\nfrom the general recollection, was the name of the estate on the\r\nHudson where for so many years Mr. Cyrus W. Field made his summer\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe family name was in the fifteenth century changed from Feld,\r\nFeild, Felde, and Fielde, into its present form; and John Field, the\r\nastronomer, was the first to introduce the Copernican system in\r\nEngland, and he received a patent in 1558, authorizing him to bear\r\nas a crest over his family arms, an arm issuing from clouds and\r\nsupporting a globe. Dr. Richard Field, chaplain of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nwas of the same family, and author of the \"Book of the Church,\"\r\nrepublished in four volumes at Oxford in 1843.\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of autumn, November 30, 1819, at the Morgan Place,\r\non a hill that sloped to the river, near Stockbridge, Mass., that\r\nCyrus West Field was born. There were three older brothers--David\r\nDudley, Timothy Beale, and Matthew Dickinson. The Cyrus came from a\r\nman of note in the town, named Cyrus Williams, and the West from Dr.\r\nStephen West, the predecessor of Dr. David Dudley Field in the pulpit\r\nat Stockbridge. It is said of the child that he was of very delicate\r\norganization, so weak and frail that his body \"had to be supported by\r\na frame in which he could roll around the room till his limbs could\r\nget strength to bear him.\" There was, however (as his younger brother,\r\nDr. Henry M. Field, the historian of the family, says in his vigorous\r\nEnglish), \"a nervous energy and elasticity derived from his mother,\"\r\nthat brought him up, and \"once set upon his little feet, he developed\r\nby incessant motion,\" and he was noted for \"restless activity,\" a\r\ncharacteristic of his whole life. His frame, always slight, \"became\r\ntough and wiry, capable of great effort and great endurance.\" Cyrus\r\nwas the one of the Field boys who did not go to college. When fifteen\r\nyears of age, his brother, David Dudley, who was nearly fifteen years\r\nhis senior, and lived until his ninetieth year, secured a place for\r\nhim in the store of A. T. Stewart. Cyrus was a thorough country boy,\r\nand his mother's boy, and did not take kindly to the city at first.\r\nDr. Field says: \"I well remember hearing my brother Matthew tell\r\nmother how Cyrus had come down to the boat on which he left the city,\r\nand wept bitterly; and mother telling him, the next time he went to\r\nNew York, if his little brother felt so still, to bring him home.\" Mr.\r\nField soon grew tired of being a clerk, and launched out in the\r\nmanufacture and sale of paper. His capital was his brains--and in\r\ntwelve years, when he was but thirty-three years old, he was in\r\npossession of a handsome fortune, and thought of retiring. This,\r\nhowever, was only a phase of restlessness, and he had before him\r\nnearly forty years of extraordinary activity. His great works and\r\ntrials, his counting his gains and losses by millions, his glory and\r\nhis sorrows, were all before him. The first of his many long journeys\r\nwas to South America, with the artist Church, who painted for him the\r\n\"Heart of the Andes.\" He ascended the Magdalena River, climbed the\r\nAndes to Bogota, crossed to Quito, and by way of Guayaquil, in\r\nEcuador, reached the western coast, and returned home October, 1853,\r\nin time for the golden wedding of his parents. Then he set about the\r\ntask of retirement from business, and was in a feverish state of\r\nenergy upon that subject, and drifted into the twelve years harassing\r\nstruggle, from the time when, in his house in Gramercy Park, he sat\r\nalone and turned over the globe, and thought of a telegraphic cable\r\nthrough the Atlantic, until the tremendous task was gloriously\r\nfinished. After writing to Maury and Morse, Mr. Field called in his\r\nnext-door neighbor, Peter Cooper; and next called Moses Taylor, who\r\nlistened for an hour without saying a word; and brought in his most\r\nintimate friend, Marshall O. Roberts; and then Mr. Chandler White (who\r\ndied the next year and was succeeded by Wilson G. Hunt). They\r\norganized \"The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company,\"\r\nField, Cooper, Taylor, and Roberts putting in $20,000 each, and White\r\na smaller sum. Field and White, with David Dudley Field as legal\r\nadviser, set forth for Newfoundland to get a charter, and called it a\r\nfishing excursion. They got a land donation, and an exclusive right to\r\nland cable for fifty years. There was first to build a line of\r\ntelegraph four hundred miles through the wilderness, across the huge\r\nisland. The land-line work lasted three years, and each of the\r\nparties who started by putting in $20,000, put in ten times that\r\namount, and Field much more. The first cable across the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence was a failure. The second one held; and at last there rolled\r\ntwo thousand miles of tempestuous ocean, with a bottom that was a\r\nmystery, between the verge of the American soil and the Irish coast.\r\n\r\nMr. Cyrus W. Field visited England as an Atlantic cable missionary,\r\nand addressed the Chambers of Commerce in the principal cities, and\r\nthe members of the Government. His intense convictions and incessant\r\nenthusiasm made way. The scientific men of England were cautious but\r\nhopeful. There had been, as it happened, the year before a survey of\r\nthe North Atlantic, disclosing conditions of the bottom of the sea,\r\nand they were reassuring. The Government was so far interested as to\r\nengage to furnish ships to lay the cable, and to guarantee £14,000 a\r\nyear for messages sent if it proved a success--four per cent. of the\r\nexpected cost; but the capital had to be raised by private\r\nenterprise, and Mr. Field visited Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester,\r\nand Liverpool, and subscribed one-fourth of the whole sum. His\r\npersistence was continued until the money was raised; but his\r\nfriends in America were not eager for the stock, and he had to pay\r\ninto the treasury of the company £88,000 in gold. The complete\r\nresponsibility of Mr. Field appears at every point. He was the\r\ninspiration and the moving force from first to last. The work was\r\nstrange, and there were delays and details of difficulty arising at\r\nevery step, that a thousand times would have been insurmountable, if\r\nit had not been for the indomitable Field, whose tenacity even\r\nexceeded his impetuosity. There were two governments to be\r\nnegotiated with to furnish ships. The cable was at last ready and on\r\nboard--and three hundred and sixty-five years after Columbus sailed\r\nfrom the shores of Spain, Field sailed from Ireland, the\r\nLord-Lieutenant, the Earl of Carlisle, making the speech of the\r\noccasion. The first effort was to lay the cable straight from\r\nIreland to Newfoundland, and the start was made Wednesday, August 5,\r\n1857. Three hundred and fifty miles out the cable broke. That was\r\nfailure; and Field's private fortune had suffered severely from his\r\nabsence. But the next year he was again in England and another start\r\nwas made--the ships going half-way and joining the cable and running\r\nboth ways. The cable parted again and again, and the ships returned\r\nto England. All were in despair but Field, and he rallied once more,\r\nand another trial was made--and succeeded. The cable lasted for a\r\nfew weeks and gave out. The people were wild with delight at the\r\nsuccess, and utterly cast down and disgusted by the failure. But the\r\nproof was out; the thing could be done. Cables had been laid in the\r\nMediterranean, and final success was in sight. A new cable was made\r\nand coiled on the Great Eastern--and when starting from Ireland and\r\none thousand two hundred and fifty miles were out, there was a break\r\nwhere the ocean was two miles deep, and a year was lost. Then\r\nanother cable on the Great Eastern, and in 1866 it held out all the\r\nway over. This was the year of the war between Prussia and Austria,\r\njust after the battle of Sadowa. The next thing was to find and\r\nsplice the lost cable of the year before, and that was done, one of\r\nthe most wonderful things that ever happened. Mr. Field told the\r\nstory before the Chamber of Commerce of New York in November, 1866,\r\nsaying, after the lost cable was found and spliced: \"A few minutes\r\nof suspense and a flash told of the lightning current again set\r\nfree--some turned their heads away and wept, others broke into\r\ncheers. Soon the wind arose and we were for thirty-six hours exposed\r\nto all the dangers of a storm on the Atlantic; yet in the fury of\r\nthe gale, as I sat in the electrician's room, a flash of light came\r\nup from the deep, which, having passed to Ireland, came back to me\r\nin mid-ocean, telling that those so dear to me, whom I had left on\r\nthe banks of the Hudson, were well, and following us with their\r\nprayers. This was like a whisper of God from the sea, bidding me\r\nkeep heart and hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe Great Eastern safely landed the second cable, and the two worlds\r\nwere safely forever joined. Mr. Field said he had often, in the long\r\nstruggle--nearly thirteen years in the forests of Newfoundland, on\r\nships in stormy seas--almost accused himself of madness, sacrificing\r\neverything for what might prove, after all, but a dream. He received\r\nthe thanks of Congress, with a gold medal--the grand medal of the\r\nFrench Exposition of 1867. Honors were heaped upon him. If he had\r\nbeen a British subject, he would have been made a baronet. He had\r\ngiven twelve years without accepting remuneration for time or toil,\r\nand his hopeful, at last haggard dream, was a marvellous golden\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nHe was forty-seven years of age. He visited Egypt at the opening of\r\nthe Suez Canal in 1864. He attended the millennial celebration of\r\nthe settlement of Iceland in August, 1874. He made with his wife a\r\ntrip around the world in 1880. He was known in all civilized lands\r\nas one of the foremost men of his time. All the people of the\r\nhighest distinction in England knew and admired him as the most\r\ntypical and celebrated of Americans. Mr. Gladstone, Mr. John Bright,\r\nthe Duke of Argyle, Dean Stanley were his intimate friends. His\r\nhouse at Gramercy Park was the scene of a splendid hospitality.\r\nThere gathered in his ample parlors, stored with souvenirs from\r\nevery land, and in his dining-room, men and women of the highest\r\nconsideration at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe keenness of his intelligence had increased with his\r\nunprecedented experience. His triumphs had given him confidence in\r\nhis executive ability, and there was nothing too daring for him to\r\ncontemplate. His bitter lessons in going to the verge of ruin, when\r\nhe gave the fortune of his youth to the enterprise that he carried\r\nto success, were amply pondered, and he resolved never again to\r\nallow those near and dear to him to take the chances of cruel\r\nfortune and the anxieties of impending want.\r\n\r\nWhen his years were numbered in the thirties, he was meditating\r\nretirement from business; and when he was in the sixties, his\r\nirrepressible activities carried him into the development of the\r\nelevated railway system on Manhattan Island, with the same ardor and\r\nfixed purpose with which, thirty years before, he had invaded the\r\nwilderness of Newfoundland to find a basis of operations for the\r\nconquest of the Atlantic. His faith was undaunted and without limit.\r\nHis touch revealed new fortunes. He saw that the elevated lines that\r\ndeveloped Harlem, would also improve lower New York; and the\r\nWashington Building, No. 1 Broadway, was the materialization of the\r\nthought. The intensity that was remarked in his childhood, and that\r\ncommanded the confidence of the capitalists of England, knew no\r\nabatement. He had been very cautious in advising Englishmen about\r\ninvestments, but had imparted to some of them the assurance that\r\nUnited States Bonds were as sound as the English investment of\r\nnational debt, and they profited by accepting his judgment. He\r\ninsisted upon popularizing the elevated roads by a uniform fare of\r\nfive cents, and had it done against strong opposition, and was more\r\nconfident than ever in the stock, of which he had an enormous\r\nholding. But it took years longer than he had calculated to make\r\ngood his plans, and in the interval came a financial storm that\r\ncompelled him to submit to a heavy loss. He bore his misfortune with\r\nfortitude, and still had a competency ample for him, when there came\r\na torrent of ill-fortune--the loss of his beloved wife, and the\r\nfailure of his sons, under circumstances that bore the distressing\r\nstamp of insanity in one of them, a taint of madness that was in the\r\nblood which had been so prolific of genius. He suffered where he was\r\nstrongest and weakest--in his love and his pride.\r\n\r\nHis spirit would have been invincible if his heart had not been\r\nbroken. No husband and father was ever more solicitous for the\r\nwelfare of wife and children. The death of his wife, followed by the\r\ndisasters that overtook his sons, wounded him as mortally as if a\r\nflight of arrows had pierced him. The very contingencies of fortune\r\nagainst which he thought he had provided with infinite painstaking,\r\nfell upon him as if from clouds in a sky he thought clear. His\r\ndeepest resolution was that, after the long strain of facing the\r\ntotal loss of fortune during the dark years of the cable enterprise,\r\nhe never again would consent to take the chances of the catastrophe\r\nthat had haunted him, and from which he had escaped at such hazard\r\nthat the fortunate interposition seemed miraculous; and he did not\r\nconsciously do the wrong to himself and dear ones he had with such\r\nanxiety sought to avoid. His misfortunes were as incalculable as\r\nincurable.\r\n\r\nThe family affection of the Fields is one of their distinctions, and\r\nthe love the four brothers, known to all the world, bore each other,\r\nwas as gentle and full of all happiness as that of children. The\r\n\"little acts of kindness, little deeds of love,\" that, as the old\r\nhymn says, would make the world an Eden, were never wanting. The\r\nfestivals in which they delighted were those of the family--the\r\neightieth birthday of the oldest brother--the golden wedding. In his\r\nlong travels, Mr. Field was ever thoughtful of home, and it was like\r\nhim, giving a dinner to a company of Americans in Edinburgh, to\r\ntelegraph to their families so that each guest found the news of\r\nthat day, from his own fireside, in a cablegram on his plate.\r\n\r\nMr. Field was no doubt attracted to Iceland, in 1874, by his studies\r\nof the northern waters; the way the world tapers off in the high\r\nlatitudes, and the fact that Iceland must have been often in his\r\nmind as he studied Newfoundland and Ireland, and knew that Iceland\r\nwas so near Greenland as to belong to the American continent, and to\r\nhave been a stepping-stone from Norway to Labrador. He was regarded\r\nby the Icelanders as almost as great a man as the King of Denmark,\r\nwho visited his remote possession at the same time; and they thought\r\nField even a greater discoverer than Columbus, for they said the\r\nGenoese navigator got his knowledge of the land in the west from\r\ntheir ancestors, and sailed on a certainty.\r\n\r\nOn the day President Garfield was shot down, he was on his way to\r\nWilliams College, and was to dine that night with Mr. Cyrus Field at\r\nArdsley, and go to the old place he called \"the sweetest in the\r\nworld\" next day. A yacht was waiting to convey the President from\r\nJersey City, when the news of the assassination became known. The\r\nPresident suffered mentally because he had not made adequate\r\nprovision for his family, and Mr. Field headed a subscription list\r\nwith a liberal sum, and in a few days had a quarter of a million\r\ndollars safely invested for Mrs. Garfield and her children. The\r\nmotive of this timely and apt generosity was, first, to afford\r\nconsolation to the dying chief magistrate.\r\n\r\nIt was within the scope of the ambition of Mr. Field to span the\r\nPacific as well as the Atlantic Ocean with a cable; but having\r\ntriumphantly overcome one ocean, he failed to put a girdle round the\r\nearth, as De Lesseps, having succeeded with the Suez Canal--the only\r\nwork of the age to be named with the Atlantic telegraph--failed at\r\nDarien.\r\n\r\nIf the prosperity of Mr. Field had continued, and the light had not\r\ngone out in his home, he would not have been content until he had\r\nransacked the globe for ways and means to have followed the sun to\r\nAsia with the telegraph. His footsteps point the way, and the road\r\nto India is westward.\r\n\r\nThe golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus W. Field was attended by\r\nhundreds of those who knew and loved them, and the great double\r\nhouse of the Fields, fronting on Gramercy Park, was full of bright\r\nfaces and glittering with lights. The historic home was soon\r\ndarkened and made desolate. The master, the renowned victor--no name\r\nmore certain of an honorable immortality than his--was one whom\r\n\"unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster.\" His wife\r\npassed away at Ardsley before the deeper gloom of the storm, and he\r\ndied there July 12, 1892. In his delirium on the morning of his\r\ndeath, he was again on the stormy coast with the cable fleet; and he\r\nsaid: \"Hold those ships--do not let them sail yet.\" Through the\r\ncenturies there had descended to him from the old astronomer, his\r\nancestor, the far-flashing conception of enterprise and\r\nunderstanding of the splendor of destiny that was his star, and\r\nmingled with its light were the gentle influences of the religion of\r\nhis fathers, always to him real and radiant. He sleeps well, amid\r\nthe scenes where he passed his boyhood, and for which his heart\r\nyearned always--beside his beloved wife; and carved in the marble of\r\ntheir tomb as the last testimony to the loving heart of his\r\ncompanion, are the words: \"Love is eternal.\" The recollection of his\r\nsorrows will not, as the centuries come and go, dim the beautiful\r\nlight of his illustrious name.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Murat Halstead.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN VICTORIA\r\n\r\nBy DONALD MACLEOD, D.D.\r\n\r\n(Born 1819-1901)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen Victoria.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWell do I remember the effect produced on the audience of students,\r\nof which I was then one, when Lord Macaulay delivered his Rectorial\r\naddress in the University of Glasgow, and when, after giving such\r\npictures as he alone could paint, of the character of the four\r\ncenturies that had closed since the university had been\r\nfounded--each epoch presenting a scene of bloodshed and\r\nmisgovernment--he sketched the possible future of the college, and\r\nanticipated the time when coming generations would tell how certain\r\ncontemplated changes had been accomplished during the reign of \"the\r\nGood Queen Victoria.\" The phrase was accentuated by an oratorical\r\nswing; and when it was given, the tremendous burst of enthusiasm\r\nshowed that they who listened felt the great historian had chosen\r\nthe right epithet, and that he intended it in the sense that, as\r\nsome monarchs are called \"Great\" and some \"Little,\" so for all time\r\nVictoria would be named \"the Good Queen.\" This was said more than\r\nforty years ago, before Tennyson had fixed the \"Household name,\"\r\n\"Albert the Good,\" for\r\n\r\n                          \"That star\r\n  Which shone so close beside Thee, that ye made\r\n  One light together.\"\r\n\r\nThe epoch in our history which is embraced between the years 1837\r\nand 1887, is unparalleled. At no time in the history of the nation,\r\nor of the world, has there been such rapid and beneficent progress.\r\nWe, who are citizens of \"the old country,\" scarcely realize the\r\nextent of our dominion. The Roman Empire was one-fourth its size;\r\nall the Russias contain an eighth less; it is sixteen times as large\r\nas France, and three times as large as the United States. The United\r\nKingdom, with its colonies and dependencies, includes about\r\none-fifth of the entire globe. The rapidity with which population\r\nhas grown in some parts of our dominion may be measured by\r\nAustralasia, which in 1837 had 134,059, and in 1885, 3,278,934, or\r\ntwenty-three times as many more. When we turn from these figures to\r\nconsider other fields of progress, we are still more amazed. It goes\r\nwithout saying that these last fifty years have seen the growth of\r\nrailways and steamships from their infancy to their present\r\nworld-embracing influence. The mileage of railways open in the\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1837 was about 294 miles, but a great proportion\r\nwas worked by horses. In 1885 the mileage was 19,169, the gross\r\nreceipts, £69,555,774; they carried about 1,275,000,000 passengers,\r\nand employed 367,793 men. Not a steamer had crossed the Atlantic by\r\nsteam alone when the queen came to the throne, and her accession was\r\nin the year previous to that during which Wheatstone in this\r\ncountry, and Morse in America, introduced electric telegraphy. We,\r\nwho enjoy express trains, six-penny telegrams, half-penny\r\npost-cards, and the parcel post, can scarcely realize that we are so\r\nnear the time when mail-coaches and sailing-packets were almost the\r\nonly means of conveyance, and when postage was a serious burden. The\r\ngreatness of the changes in social life may be realized when we\r\nremember that, so recently as 1844, duelling was banished from the\r\ncode of honor; that crime has diminished seventy-one per cent. since\r\n1837; and that while fifty years ago Government did nothing for\r\neducation, there are now 30,000 public schools under the Privy\r\nCouncil. These facts are suggestive of the extent of the advance. Or\r\nif, without touching on the marvellous victories of science, we try\r\nto form an estimate of religious progress, and take the tables for\r\nProtestant missions as giving a fair indication of the zeal and\r\nself-sacrifice of the churches, we find that while British\r\ncontributions in 1837 amounted to £316,610, in 1885 they reached\r\n£1,222,261.\r\n\r\nIt may be said with truth that the progress thus indicated must have\r\ngone on, no matter who sat on the throne; but it would be unjust not\r\nto recognize the close influence which the Crown has directly and\r\nindirectly exercised on its advance. There has been no movement\r\ntending to the development of the arts and the industries of the\r\ncountry which has not enlisted the active sympathy of the royal\r\nfamily. From the first the Prince Consort recognized the important\r\npart which the sovereign could fulfil in reference to the peaceful\r\nvictories of science and art. Beginning with agriculture--the\r\nimprovement of stock and the better housing of agricultural\r\nlaborers, we trace the effect of his constant toil in the series of\r\nindustrial triumphs, of which the great exhibition of 1851 was the\r\nmagnificent precursor; and, in recent years, the same kind of\r\nobjects have always enlisted the best energies of the queen and her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Victoria greeted as Queen.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast is great and touching between the scene in Westminster\r\nAbbey, when, amid the pomp of a gorgeous ceremonial and the\r\nacclamation of her subjects, the fair girl-queen received the crown\r\nof Britain, and that other scene, when, after fifty years of a\r\ngovernment that has been unblemished, she once more kneels in the\r\nsame spot--a widow surrounded by her children and her children's\r\nchildren, bearing the burden of many sad as well as blessed\r\nmemories, and encompassed with the thanksgivings of the three\r\nhundred millions of her subjects. We can imagine how oppressive, for\r\none so loving, must then be the vision of the past, as she recalls,\r\none after another, the once familiar and dear faces which greeted\r\nher coronation, those relatives, great ministers of state, and\r\nwarriors of whom so few survive; and when all her happy married\r\nyears and the years of parting and desolation appear in vivid\r\nretrospect. But if ever monarch had cause to bless God for His\r\ntender mercies, it must be she who can combine with the memory of\r\nher own life's hopes and trials the consciousness that, in the great\r\nwork given her as a sovereign, she has been enabled to fulfil the\r\nbeautiful desire of her innocent childhood, when, on her first being\r\ninformed of her royal destiny, she indulged in no vain dream of\r\npower, but uttered the simple longing \"to be good.\" That goodness\r\nhas been her real greatness.\r\n\r\nThe life of her majesty is marked by three great stages--her youth,\r\nher married life, and her widowhood. Each is bound to each by the\r\ntie of a consistent growth, passing through those experiences which\r\nare typical of God's education of His children, whether high or low,\r\nrich or poor.\r\n\r\nHer childhood, with its wise education, is very much the key to her\r\nafter-life. Possessed naturally of a quick intellectual capacity,\r\nand an unusually accurate memory, a taste for music and the arts,\r\nand a deeply affectionate heart, she was admirably brought up by her\r\nmother, the Duchess of Kent, on whom the training of the future\r\nqueen devolved from her infancy. If the education was as high as it\r\nwas possible to afford a young and intelligent spirit, the moral\r\ninfluences were equally beneficial. The young princess, instead of\r\nbeing isolated within the formalities of a court, was allowed to\r\nbecome acquainted with the wants and sufferings of the poor, and to\r\nindulge her sympathies by giving them personal help. The contrast\r\nwas a great one between the court of George IV., or even that of\r\nWilliam, and the truly English home where the Duchess of Kent\r\nnurtured this sweet life in all that was simple, loving, and pure.\r\nThere could scarcely have been a better school for an affectionate\r\nnature. All that we learn of her majesty at that time gives a\r\nconsistent picture of great vivacity, thorough directness in her\r\nsearch after truth, warmth of heart, and considerateness for others,\r\nwith a genuine love for all that is morally good. These were the\r\ncharacteristics which impressed those who saw her on the trying\r\noccasion when she was suddenly ushered into the foremost place in\r\nthe greatest empire in the world. It was these characteristics which\r\ntouched the hearts of the good archbishop and of the Chancellor of\r\nEngland when they announced her great destiny to the girl suddenly\r\nsummoned from slumber. That first request, \"My Lord Archbishop, pray\r\nfor me!\" revealed the depth of her character. It was the same when\r\nshe had next day to pass through the ordeal of meeting the great\r\ncouncillors of state for the first time. Lord Melbourne, the Duke of\r\nWellington, Peel, and the keen-eyed Secretary Greville, all felt the\r\nbeautiful combination of dignity with unaffected simplicity, and of\r\nquick intelligence with royal courtesy. But they did not see the\r\nepisode which followed the fatigue and excitement of the long\r\nformalities of the council, when the young queen rushed first of all\r\nto her mother's arms, there to indulge her feelings in a burst of\r\ntears, and then, with girlish naïveté, claiming the exercise of her\r\nroyal prerogative to procure for herself two hours of absolute\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nThe earlier years of her reign were happily blessed with the wise\r\nand beneficent influence of Lord Melbourne. His relationship to the\r\nyouthful sovereign was more that of a father and able political\r\ninstructor than of a formal first minister of the crown. He was too\r\nexperienced not heartily to appreciate the beautiful character of\r\nhis young mistress, and the interest he took in her political\r\neducation, and in everything likely to further her prosperity and\r\nhappiness, was evidently kindled by warm affection. She was equally\r\nfavored in having as adviser so sagacious a relative as her uncle\r\nLeopold, the late King of the Belgians. The Duke of Wellington\r\nregarded her almost as a daughter; and there was also, ever at hand,\r\nanother, whose trained intellect and loyal heart exercised no little\r\ninfluence on her career--Baron Stockmar--to whose lofty ideal of the\r\nfunctions of royalty, calmly balanced treatment of all questions of\r\nstate policy, and high-toned moral sympathies, both the queen and\r\nthe prince consort have amply expressed their indebtedness.\r\n\r\nWithout touching further on the earlier period of her reign, which\r\nwas not without many incidents of interest, we turn to the married\r\nyears of the queen as to a bright and sunny memory.\r\n\r\nThe position of an unmarried or widowed queen necessarily entails a\r\npeculiar loneliness. She is surrounded by the rigorous demands of\r\nstate necessity. If she has to form a judgment upon documents\r\nsubmitted to her, there is no one so close to her and so independent\r\nof all other influences as to be truly an _alter ego_. Faithful\r\nservants of the crown may do their best to be of use, but no one of\r\nthem can be so near as to receive such unguarded confidences as can\r\nbe given to the husband who shares every joy and sorrow. The queen's\r\nmarried life was ideally perfect. She married the man she loved, and\r\neach year deepened her early affection into an admiration, a\r\nreverence, and a pride which elevated her love into consecration.\r\n\r\nThere was no home in England made more beautiful by all that was\r\ntender, cultured, and noble than that in which \"the blameless\r\nprince\" fulfilled his heroic career of duty, and shed the bright\r\nlight of his joyous, affectionate, and keenly intellectual life.\r\nThere were few homes in which a greater amount of trying and anxious\r\nwork was more systematically accomplished, or in which there was a\r\nmore exquisite blending of hard thinking with the enjoyment of the\r\nfine arts and the fulness of loving family happiness. We have\r\npicture after picture given us in the life of the Prince Consort\r\nwhich puts us in touch with these brilliant years, when the queen\r\nand he were never parted but for one or two brief intervals. Early\r\nhours of close labor were followed by a genial and hearty\r\nrelaxation, and at every turn the wife and sovereign felt the\r\nblessedness of that presence which ministered to her in sickness\r\nwith the gentleness of a woman, and which she leaned upon in hours\r\nof difficulty with complete trust in the strength and trueness of\r\nhis wise intellect. There was no decrease on either side in those\r\nfeelings and utterances of feeling which are so beautiful when they\r\ncarry into after years the warmth of the first attachment, only\r\nhallowed and deepened by experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Windsor Castle.]\r\n\r\nThere were many fresh features in the kind of life which was\r\nintroduced by the queen and the consort into the habits of the\r\ncourt. Among these none were more marked than the breaking up of\r\nthat monotony which the restrictions that hitherto prevailed as to\r\nthe residence of the royal family in one or two state palaces\r\nentailed. We can well understand how the Empress Eugénie should have\r\nfound the Tuileries, in spite of its grandeur, no better than \"_une\r\nbelle prison_,\" and her delight at the comparative freedom she\r\nenjoyed at Windsor. The queen and Prince Consort inaugurated a new\r\nera in the customs of the court by taking advantage of the\r\nfacilities afforded by modern methods of conveyance. Scarcely any\r\npart of the country celebrated for scenery, or any town famous for\r\nits industries, remained unvisited by them.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effects of these journeys were great. Loyalty is to a\r\nlarge extent a personal matter, and is necessarily deepened when the\r\nrepresentative of the state not only possesses moral dignity of\r\ncharacter but comes frequently into contact with the people. It is\r\nalso of use to the crown that its wearer should know, from actual\r\nobservation, the conditions of life in the country. It is in the\r\nlight of this mutual action of acquaintance between prince and\r\npeople that we estimate the value of that knowledge which the Prince\r\nof Wales, his brothers, and his sons have gained of so many parts of\r\nthe empire. The Prince Consort felt keenly the use of these\r\ninfluences. \"How important and beneficent,\" he once said, \"is the\r\npart given to the royal family of England to act in the development\r\nof those distant and rising countries, who recognize in the British\r\ncrown and their allegiance to it, their supreme bond of union with\r\nthe mother country and to each other!\"\r\n\r\nDuring each year of their married life the queen and Prince Consort\r\nwent on some interesting tour. In England, Oxford and Cambridge,\r\nBirmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, received royal visits,\r\nwhile such historical houses as Chatsworth, Hatfield, Stowe, and\r\nStrathfieldsay were honored by their presence. Ireland was thrice\r\nvisited. Wales more than once. The first visit to Scotland was made\r\nin 1842, another in 1844, and from 1847 only one year passed without\r\na long residence in the north--first at Ardverachie, on Loch Laggan,\r\nand then at what was to be their Highland home on Deeside. Repeated\r\nvisits were also made to the Continent, sometimes in state and\r\nsometimes in as much privacy as could be commanded.\r\n\r\nIt is when we come to this bright time, so full of fresh interest\r\nand of a delightful freedom, that we have the advantage of the\r\nqueen's own \"Leaves from the Journal of our Life in the Highlands.\"\r\nHer visit to Edinburgh in 1842, and the drive by Birnam and\r\nAberfeldy to Taymouth, and the splendor of the reception, when, amid\r\nthe cheers of a thousand Highlanders and the wild notes of the\r\nbagpipes, she was welcomed by Lord Breadalbane, evidently stirred\r\nevery feeling of romance. \"It seemed,\" she wrote, \"as if a great\r\nchieftain of olden feudal times was receiving his sovereign.\" It\r\nappeared like a new world, when, throwing off for a time the\r\nrestrictions of state, she found herself at Blair two years\r\nafterward, climbing the great hills of Atholl, and from the top of\r\nTulloch looking forth on the panorama of mountain and glen. \"It was\r\nquite romantic; here we were with only this Highlander behind us\r\nholding the ponies, not a house, not a creature near us but the\r\npretty Highland sheep, with their horns and black faces. It was the\r\nmost delightful, most romantic, ride and walk I ever had.\" These\r\nearly visits to Scotland inspired her with her love for the\r\nHighlands and the Highlanders. She found there quite a world of\r\npoetry. The majestic scenery, the fresh, bracing air, the\r\npicturesqueness of the kilted gillies, the piping and the dancing,\r\nand the long days among the heather, recalled scenes which Sir\r\nWalter Scott has glorified for all time, and which are especially\r\nidentified with the fortunes of the unhappy Stuarts, of whom she is\r\nnow the nearest representative.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1848 that the court proceeded for the first time to\r\nBalmoral, then a picturesque but small castle. The air of Deeside\r\nhad been recommended by Sir James Clark, the queen's physician, and\r\nhis anticipation of the benefits to be derived from residence there\r\nwas so completely realized that although four years passed before\r\nthe property was actually purchased, yet preparations were made for\r\nestablishing there a royal home. Plans for the future castle and for\r\nlaying out the grounds were gone into by the prince with keen\r\ndelight. \"All has become my dear Albert's own creation, own work,\r\nown building, own laying out, as at Osborne; and his great taste and\r\nthe impress of his dear hand have been stamped everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nIt was here that the queen and the Prince Consort enjoyed for more\r\nthan twelve years a delightful freedom, mingling with their people,\r\ndevising the wisest methods for insuring their well-being, going\r\nwith them to worship in their plain (very plain!) parish church, and\r\nbeing to each and all unaffectedly sincere friends. Every spot\r\naround soon became consecrated by some sweet association. Every\r\ngreat family event had its commemoration amid the scenery around the\r\ncastle; though many a cairn, once raised in joy, is now, alas! a\r\nmonument of sorrow. The life at Balmoral was in every sense\r\nbeneficial. There never has been there the kind of relaxation that\r\ncomes from idleness. Systematic work has been always maintained at\r\nBalmoral as at Windsor. Early hours in the fresh morning and a\r\nregular arrangement of time during the day have given room for the\r\nconstant business of the crown; but every now and then there were\r\nglorious \"outings,\" whether for sport or for some far-reaching\r\nexpedition, which gave fresh zest to happy and united toil.\r\n\r\nThere is more than one characteristic of the queen which may recall\r\nto Scotchmen the history of their own Stuarts, and among these is\r\nher enjoyment of expeditions _incognita_. The Prince Consort, with\r\nhis simple German heart, entered fully into the \"fun\" of such\r\njourneys, as, starting off on long rides across mountain-passes and\r\nthrough swollen burns and streams, lunching on heights from which\r\nthey could gaze far and wide over mountain and strath, they would\r\nreach some little roadside inn, and there, assuming a feigned name,\r\nhad the delight of feeling themselves \"private people,\" while the\r\nsimple fare and the ridiculous _contretemps_ which frequently\r\noccurred were enjoyed the more keenly because of their contrast to\r\naccustomed state. And during all these years their domestic life was\r\nunbroken by any great family sorrow. It was not till a year before\r\nher great bereavement that the queen lost her mother, the Duchess of\r\nKent. Few can read the account of that sorrowful parting without\r\nbeing drawn nearer to the sovereign by the tie of a common humanity,\r\nso deep and tender is the affection that is revealed.\r\n\r\nBut till 1861 the queen was surrounded by all those who were dearest\r\nto her, and she and the prince shared the sweet task of\r\nsuperintending their children's education. Few parents more\r\nanxiously considered the best methods for securing a sound moral and\r\nreligious training. \"The greatest maxim of all,\" writes the queen,\r\n\"is that the children shall be brought up as simply and in as\r\ndomestic a way as possible, that (without interfering with their\r\nlessons) they should be as much as possible with their parents, and\r\nlearn to place their greatest confidence in them in all things.\" As\r\nto religious training, the queen's conviction was that it is best\r\nwhen given to a child \"day by day at his mother's knee.\" It was only\r\nthe great pressure of public duty which rendered it impossible for\r\nher to fulfil her part so completely as she desired. \"It is a hard\r\ncase for me,\" her majesty writes, in reference to the princess\r\nroyal, \"that my occupations prevent me being with her when she says\r\nher prayers.\"\r\n\r\nThe religious convictions of the queen and the Prince Consort were\r\ndeep. They both cared little for those mere accidents and\r\nconventionalities of religion which so many magnify into essentials.\r\nThe prince, eminently devout, insisted on the realities of religion.\r\n\"We want not what is safe, but true,\" was his commentary on the\r\nexaggerated outcry against \"Essays and Reviews.\" \"The Gospel, and\r\nthe unfettered right to its use,\" was his claim for Protestantism.\r\nFor his own spirit, like that of the queen, was truly religious. The\r\nquiet evenings spent together before communion, and the directness\r\nand reverence with which both served God were combined with an utter\r\nabhorrence of all intolerance. Such qualities are generally\r\nmisunderstood by the narrow-minded, who have only their own\r\n\"shibboleths\" to test all faith, and the one Church--whatever it may\r\nbe--that they regard as \"true.\" The queen and the prince rose above\r\nsuch distinctions; they shared the Catholicism of St. Paul, \"Grace\r\nbe with all who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.\"\r\n\r\nBut these bright and happy years were doomed to a sudden ending. It\r\nis only when we have realized all that her husband was to her that\r\nwe can measure how fearful was the blow to her loving heart when he\r\nwho was her pride and her constant companion was laid low. We may\r\nwell feel what a shattering it brought to all that hitherto had\r\nenriched her life, and how very desolate her position became when\r\nshe was left in loneliness on the throne, a widow separated by her\r\nqueendom from many of those supports which others find near them,\r\nbut from which she was deprived by her position. \"Fourteen happy and\r\nblessed years have passed,\" she wrote, in 1854, \"and I confidently\r\ntrust many more will pass, and find us in old age as we now are,\r\nhappily and devotedly united. Trials we must have, but what are they\r\nif we are together?\" In God's wisdom that hope was not to be\r\nrealized, and in 1861 the stroke fell, and it fell with crushing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to lift the curtain of sorrow that fell like a\r\nfuneral pall over the first years of her widowhood. For many a day\r\nit seemed as if the grief was more than she could bear, and although\r\nshe was sustained through it all by God's grace, and supported by\r\nthe sympathy of the nation, yet it was naturally a long-continued\r\nand absorbing sorrow. Other blows have fallen since then. The tender\r\nand wise Princess Alice, and the thoughtful and cultured Duke of\r\nAlbany, have also been gathered to their rest; and the queen has had\r\nto mourn over one after another of her most faithful servants taken\r\nfrom her. But the hallowing hand of time, the soothing remembrance\r\nof unspeakable mercies, and the call to noble duty, have done much\r\nto restore the strength, if not the joy, of former days. Her people\r\nrejoice, and the influence of the Crown is enormously strengthened,\r\nwhen in these later years the queen has been able once more to\r\nmingle with the nation.\r\n\r\nWhen we touch on the third period of her life--which may well be\r\ntermed that of sorrow, although brightened by many happy events in\r\nthe domestic life of her children--we reach times that are familiar\r\nto every reader. These have been years in which the cares of state\r\nhave often been exceedingly burdensome. The days of anxiety during\r\nthe Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny have more than once had their\r\ncounterpart. Afghanistan, Zululand with its Isandula, and the\r\nTransvaal War with its Majuba Hill, Egypt, and the Soudan, brought\r\nhours of sore anxiety to the sovereign; but they were probably not\r\nmore harassing to intellect and heart than the months of difficult\r\ndiplomacy which the threatening aspect of European politics\r\nfrequently laid upon Government.\r\n\r\nI may say in passing that no portrait of her appears to me to be\r\nquite satisfactory. They usually have only one expression, that of\r\nsadness and thoughtfulness, and so far they give a true\r\nrepresentation; for when there is nothing to rouse her interest and\r\nwhen she is silent, that look of sadness is doubtless what chiefly\r\nimpresses one. Her face then bears the traces of weary thought and\r\nof trying sorrow; but when she is engaged in conversation, and\r\nespecially if her keen sense of humor has been touched, her\r\ncountenance becomes lit with an exceedingly engaging brightness, or\r\nbeams with heartiest laughter.\r\n\r\nHer life at Balmoral since her great sorrow maintains, as far as may\r\nbe, the traditions of the happy past. She still makes expeditions,\r\n_cognita_ or _incognita_, sometimes to the scenes of former\r\nenjoyment or to new places of interest. She has in this way visited\r\nBlair, Dunkeld, Invermark, Glenfiddich, Invertrossachs, Dunrobin,\r\nInverlochy, Inverary, Loch Marll, and Broxmouth.\r\n\r\nThe queen, among her people at Balmoral, gives a splendid example to\r\nevery landlord. \"The first lady in the land\" is the most gracious\r\nmistress possible. Her interest is no condescending \"make-believe,\"\r\nas we sometimes find it in the case of others, who seek a certain\r\npopularity among their dependents by showing spasmodic attentions\r\nwhich it is difficult to harmonize with a prevailing indifference.\r\nWith the queen it is the unaffected care of one who really loves her\r\npeople, and who is keenly touched by all that touches them. She\r\nknows them all by name, and in the times of their sorrow they\r\nexperience from her a personal sympathy peculiarly soothing. There\r\nis indeed no part of the volumes she has given us more surprising\r\nthan the minute knowledge she there shows of all the people who have\r\nbeen in any way connected with her. The gillies, guides, and\r\ngamekeepers, the maids who have served her, the attendants,\r\ncoachmen, and footmen, are seldom mentioned without some notice of\r\ntheir lives being recorded as faithfully as is the case with peers\r\nand peeresses. How few mistresses are there who, burdened as she is\r\nwith duty, would thus hold in kindest remembrance each faithful\r\nservant, become acquainted with their circumstances, and provide for\r\nthem in age or in trial with generous solicitude. It is this rich\r\nhumanity of feeling that is her noblest characteristic. The public\r\nare accustomed to see messages of sympathy sent by the queen in\r\ncases of disaster and of accident, but they cannot know how truly\r\nthose calamities fall upon her own heart. As far as her life in the\r\nHighlands is concerned, she is now perhaps the best specimen we have\r\nof what the old Highland chieftain used to be, only that in her case\r\nwe find the benefits of paternal government without its harsh\r\nseverities. There is the same frank and hearty attachment to her\r\ndependents, the same intimate knowledge of each one of them, the\r\nsame recognition of services. It is a queenly quality to recognize\r\nwhat is worthy, no matter what the rank may be. It was from this she\r\nplaced so much confidence in her faithful attendant, John Brown. Her\r\ngreat kindness to him was her own generous interpretation of the\r\nlong and loyal services of one who, for more than thirty years, had\r\nbeen personal attendant on the Prince Consort and herself, leading\r\nher pony during many a long day upon the hills, watching over her\r\nsafety in London as well as on Deeside, and who, on more than one\r\noccasion, protected her from peril. \"His attention, care and\r\nfaithfulness cannot be exceeded,\" she writes in the first volume of\r\nthe \"Leaves,\" \"and the state of my health, which of late years has\r\nbeen sorely tried and weakened, renders such qualifications most\r\nvaluable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORENCE NIGHTINGALE\r\n\r\nBy LIZZIE ALLDRIDGE\r\n\r\n(Born 1820)\r\n\r\n\r\nA very distinguished lady nurse, who has been in half the hospitals\r\nin Europe, once said to me: \"To Florence Nightingale, who was my own\r\nfirst teacher and inspirer, we owe the wonderful change that has\r\ntaken place in the public mind with regard to nursing. When I first\r\nbegan my hospital training, hospital nursing was thought to be a\r\nprofession which no decent woman of any rank could follow. If a\r\nservant turned nurse, it was supposed she did so because she had\r\nlost her character. We have changed all that now. Modern nursing\r\nowes its first impulse to Florence Nightingale.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale.]\r\n\r\nI don't suppose that any of my young readers have ever seen a\r\nhospital nurse of the now nearly extinct Gamp type; but I have. I\r\nhave seen her, coarse-faced, thick of limb, heavy of foot, brutal in\r\nspeech, crawling up and down the stairs or about the wards, in\r\ndresses and aprons that made me feel (although quite well and with a\r\ngood healthy appetite) as if I would not have my good dinner just\r\nthen. These were the old-fashioned \"Sairey Gamps.\" But Florence\r\nNightingale has been too strong for even the immortal \"Sairey.\" Go\r\nnow through the corridors and wards of a modern hospital; every\r\nnurse you meet will be neat and trim, with spotless dress and cap\r\nand apron, moving quickly but quietly to and fro, doing her work\r\nwith kindness and intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1820, the year George the Third's long life quite faded\r\nout, that the younger of the two daughters of William Shore\r\nNightingale was born at Florence, and named after that lovely city.\r\n\r\nMr. Nightingale, of Embley Park, Hampshire, and the Lea Hurst,\r\nDerbyshire, was a wealthy land-owner. He was of the Shores of\r\nDerbyshire, but inherited the fortune with the name of Nightingale\r\nthrough his mother. Lea Hurst, where Miss Nightingale passed the\r\nsummer months of each year, is situated in the Matlock district,\r\namong bold masses of limestone rock, gray walls, full of fossils,\r\ncovered with moss and lichen, with the changeful river Derwent now\r\ndashing over its stony bed, now quietly winding between little dales\r\nwith clefts and dingles. Those who have travelled by the Derby and\r\nBuxton Railway will remember the narrow valleys, the mountain\r\nstreams, the wide spans of high moorland, the distant ranges of\r\nhills beyond the hills of the district. Lea Hurst, a gable-ended\r\nhouse, standing among its own woods and commanding wonderful views\r\nof the Peak country, is about two miles from Cromford station.\r\n\r\nAt Lea Hurst much of Florence Nightingale's childhood was passed.\r\nThere she early developed that intense love for every living\r\nsuffering thing, that grew with her growth, until it became the\r\nmaster-passion of her life.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale always retained her belief in animals. Many\r\nyears after her name was known all over the world, she wrote: \"A\r\nsmall pet animal is often an excellent companion for the sick, for\r\nlong chronic cases especially.\" An invalid, in giving an account of\r\nhis nursing by a nurse and a dog, infinitely preferred that of the\r\ndog. \"Above all,\" he said, \"it did not talk.\" Even Florence\r\nNightingale's maimed dolls were tenderly nursed and bandaged.\r\n\r\nMr. Nightingale was a man singularly in advance of his time as\r\nregards the training of girls. The \"higher education of women\" was\r\nunknown to the general public in those days, but not to Mr.\r\nNightingale. His daughter was taught mathematics, and studied the\r\nclassics, history, and modern languages under her father's\r\nguidance. These last were afterward of the greatest use to her in\r\nthe Crimea. But she was no \"learned lady;\" only a well-educated\r\nEnglishwoman all round. She was an excellent musician, and skilful\r\nin work with the needle; and the delicate trained touch thus\r\nacquired stood her in good stead, for the soldiers used to say that\r\na wound which Miss Nightingale dressed \"was sure to get well.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt a strong craving for work, more even than the schools and\r\ncottages, the care of the young, the sick, and the aged (in which\r\nshe followed her mother's example) could afford her at her father's\r\nhome. Mrs. Browning tells us to\r\n\r\n                 \"Get leave to work\r\n  In this world; 'tis the best you get at all.\"\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale not only got leave to work, but did so, very\r\nquietly but very persistently. And so she became a pioneer for less\r\ncourageous souls, and won for them also \"leave to work.\" Taught by\r\nher father, she soon learned to distinguish between what was really\r\ngood work and which mere make-believe. She had many opportunities,\r\neven as a child, of seeing really fine, artistic work both in\r\nscience and art. She set up a high standard, and was never satisfied\r\nwith anything short of the best, either in herself or others. It is\r\na grand thing to know good work when you see it.\r\n\r\nThe love of work, however, with Florence Nightingale, always went\r\nhand in hand with that love for every living thing in God's world\r\nwhich was born with her and which was never crowded out by all this\r\neducation. As she grew up she more and more felt that helpfulness\r\nwas the first law of her being; but her reason and intellect having\r\nbeen so carefully trained, she was thoroughly persuaded that, in\r\norder to help effectually, one must know thoroughly both the cause\r\nof suffering and its radical cure.\r\n\r\nThe study of nursing had an irresistible attraction for her. Few\r\npeople in England at that time valued nursing. Florence Nightingale\r\nwas convinced that indifference arose from the all but absolute\r\nignorance of what nursing should be, and she set herself to acquire\r\nthe necessary knowledge to enable her to carry it out in the very\r\nbest and most scientific way. She never lost an opportunity of\r\nvisiting a hospital, either at home or abroad. She gave up the life\r\nof so-called \"pleasure,\" which it was then considered a young woman\r\nof her position ought to lead, and after having very carefully\r\nexamined innumerable nursing institutions at home and abroad, at\r\nlength went to the well-known Pastor Fliedner's Deaconesses, at\r\nKaiserswerth, where she remained for several months.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Kaiserswerth, Miss Nightingale was for a while with\r\nthe Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul, in Paris, so anxious was she to\r\nsee how nursing was carried on under many different systems. It was\r\nduring 1851, the year of the first Great Exhibition, that she was\r\nthus fitting herself practically for the great task that lay before\r\nher in the not very distant future.\r\n\r\nOn her return to England, Miss Nightingale found a patient that\r\nrequired all her time and help of every kind. This patient was none\r\nother than the Sanatorium in Harley Street for gentlewomen of\r\nlimited means. Into the saving of this valuable institution Miss\r\nNightingale threw all her energy, and for two or three years, hidden\r\naway from the outside world, she was working day and night for her\r\npoor suffering ladies, until at length she was able to feel that the\r\nSanatorium was not only in good health, but on the high road to\r\npermanent success.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale's own health, however, gave way under the\r\nlong-continued strain of anxiety and fatigue; she was obliged to\r\nleave the invalids for whom she had done so much, and go home for\r\nthe rest and change she so sorely needed.\r\n\r\nNow, while Miss Nightingale had been quietly getting \"Harley Street\"\r\ninto working order, the gravest and most terrible changes had taken\r\nplace in the affairs of the nation, and not only in those of\r\nEngland, but in those of the whole of Europe. In 1851, when the\r\nfirst Great Exhibition was opened, all was peace--the long peace of\r\nforty years was still unbroken--people said it never was to be\r\nbroken again, and that wars and rumors of wars had come to an end.\r\nSo much for human foreknowledge. By the autumn of 1854, the horrors\r\nof the Crimean war had reached their climax. The _Times_ was full,\r\nday by day, of the most thrilling and appalling descriptions of the\r\nhideous sufferings of our brave men--sufferings caused quite as much\r\nby the utter breakdown of the sanitary administration as by even the\r\ndeadly battles and trenchwork; while every post was bringing\r\nagonizing private letters appealing for help.\r\n\r\nMen were wounded in the Crimea, the hospitals were far off at\r\nScutari, the wide and stormy Black Sea had to be crossed to reach\r\nthem; the stores of food, clothing, and medicine that might have\r\nsaved many a life were at Varna, or lost in the Black Prince; the\r\nstate of the great Barrack Hospital at Scutari was indescribably\r\nhorrible; everybody was frantic to rush to the relief; no one knew\r\nwhat best to do; public feeling was at fever-heat. How could it be\r\notherwise when William Howard Russell, the _Times_ correspondent,\r\nwas constantly writing such true but heartrending letters as this:\r\n\r\n\"The commonest accessories of a hospital are wanting; there is not\r\nthe least attention paid to decency or cleanliness; the stench is\r\nappalling; the fetid air can barely struggle out to taint the\r\natmosphere, save through the chinks in the walls and roofs; and for\r\nall I can observe, these men die without the least effort being made\r\nto save them. Here they lie, just as they were let gently down on\r\nthe ground by the poor fellows, their comrades, who brought them on\r\ntheir backs from the camp with the greatest tenderness, but who are\r\nnot allowed to remain with them. The sick appear to be tended by the\r\nsick, and the dying by the dying.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale, who was then recovering from her Harley Street\r\nnursing, deeply felt the intensity of the crisis that was moving the\r\nwhole nation; but, whereas the panic had driven most of the kind\r\npeople who were so eager to help the army, nearly \"off their heads,\"\r\nit only made hers the cooler and clearer. She wrote, offering her\r\nservices to Mr. Sidney Herbert, afterward Lord Herbert, the minister\r\nfor war, who, together with his wife, had long known her, and had\r\nrecognized her wonderful organizing faculties, and her great\r\npractical experience.\r\n\r\nIt was on October 15th that she wrote to Mr. Herbert. On the very\r\nsame day the minister had written to her. Their letters crossed. Mr.\r\nHerbert, who had himself given much attention to military hospitals,\r\nlaid before Miss Nightingale, in his now historical letter, a plan\r\nfor nursing the sick and wounded at Scutari.\r\n\r\n\"There is, as far as I know,\" he wrote, \"only one person in England\r\ncapable of organizing and directing such a plan, and I have been\r\nseveral times on the point of asking you if you would be disposed to\r\nmake the attempt. That it will be difficult to form a corps of\r\nnurses, no one knows better than yourself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter specifying the difficulty in finding not only good nurses, but\r\ngood nurses who would be willing to submit to authority, he goes on:\r\n\"I have this simple question to put to you. Could you go out\r\nyourself and take charge of everything? It is, of course, understood\r\nthat you will have absolute authority over all the nurses, unlimited\r\npower to draw on the Government for all you judge necessary to the\r\nsuccess of your mission; and I think I may assure you of the\r\nco-operation of the medical staff. Your personal qualities, your\r\nknowledge, and your authority in administrative affairs, all fit you\r\nfor this position.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale at once concurred in Mr. Herbert's proposal. The\r\nmaterials for a staff of good nurses did not exist, and she had to\r\nput up with the best that could be gathered on such short notice.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, a letter by Mr. Herbert, from the War Office, told the\r\nworld that \"Miss Nightingale, accompanied by thirty-four nurses,\r\nwill leave this evening. Miss Nightingale, who has, I believe,\r\ngreater practical experience of hospital administration and\r\ntreatment than any other lady in this country, has, with a\r\nself-devotion for which I have no words to express my gratitude,\r\nundertaken this noble but arduous work.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of days later there was a paragraph in the _Times_ from\r\nMiss Nightingale herself, referring to the gifts for the soldiers\r\nthat had been offered so lavishly: \"Miss Nightingale neither invites\r\nnor refuses the generous offers. Her banking account is open at\r\nMessrs. Coutts's.\" On October 30th, the _Times_ republished from the\r\n_Examiner_ a letter, headed, \"Who is Miss Nightingale?\" and signed\r\n\"One who has known her.\" Then was made known to the British public\r\nfor the first time who the woman that had gone to the aid of the\r\nsick and wounded really was; then it was shown that she was no\r\nhospital matron, but a young and singularly graceful and\r\naccomplished gentlewoman of wealth and position, who had, not in a\r\nmoment of national enthusiasm, but as the set purpose of her life\r\nfrom girlhood up, devoted herself to the studying of God's great and\r\ngood laws of health, and to trying to apply them to the help of her\r\nsuffering fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nFrom October 30, 1854, the heroine of the Crimean war was Florence\r\nNightingale, and the heroine of that war will she be while the\r\nEnglish tongue exists and English history is read. The national\r\nenthusiasm for her was at once intense, and it grew deeper and more\r\nintense as week by week revealed her powers. \"Less talent and energy\r\nof character, less singleness of purpose and devotion, could never\r\nhave combined the heterogeneous elements which she gathered together\r\nin one common work and labor of love.\"\r\n\r\nI met the other day a lady who saw something of Miss Nightingale\r\njust before she went out to the East. This lady tells me that Miss\r\nNightingale was then most graceful in appearance, tall and slight,\r\nvery quiet and still. At first sight her earnest face struck one as\r\ncold; but when she began to speak she grew very animated, and her\r\ndark eyes shone out with a peculiarly star-like brightness.\r\n\r\nThis was the woman whose starting for the East was at once felt to\r\nbe the beginning of better things; but so prejudiced were many good\r\nEnglish people against women-nurses for soldiers, that Mrs. Jameson,\r\nwriting at the time, calls the scheme \"an undertaking wholly new to\r\nour English customs, much at variance with the usual education given\r\nto women in this country.\" She, sensible woman, one in advance of\r\nher day, hoped it would succeed, but hoped rather faintly. \"If it\r\nsucceeds,\" she goes on, \"it will be the true, the lasting glory of\r\nFlorence Nightingale and her band of devoted assistants, that they\r\nhave broken down a 'Chinese wall of prejudices,' religious, social,\r\nprofessional, and have established a precedent which will, indeed,\r\nmultiply the good to all time.\"\r\n\r\nThe little band of nurses crossed the Channel to Boulogne, where\r\nthey found the fisherwomen eager for the honor of carrying their\r\nluggage to the railway. This display, however, seemed to Miss\r\nNightingale to be so out of keeping with the deep gravity of her\r\nmission, that, at her wish, it was not repeated at any of the\r\nstopping-places during the route. The Vectis took the nurses across\r\nthe Mediterranean, and a terribly rough passage they had. On\r\nNovember 5th, the very day on which the battle of Inkermann was\r\nfought, the ship arrived at Scutari.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale and her nurses landed during the afternoon, and it\r\nwas remarked at the time that their neat black dresses formed a\r\nstrong contrast to those of the usual hospital attendants.\r\n\r\nThe great Barrack Hospital at Scutari, which had been lent to the\r\nBritish by the Turkish Government, was an enormous quadrangular\r\nbuilding, a quarter of a mile each way, with square towers at each\r\nangle. It stood on the Asiatic shore a hundred feet above the\r\nBosphorus. Another large hospital stood near; the whole, at times,\r\ncontaining as many as four thousand men. The whole were placed under\r\nMiss Nightingale's care. The nurses were lodged in the southeast\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nThe extent of corridors in the great hospital, story above story, in\r\nwhich the sick and wounded were at first laid on wretched\r\npalliasses, as close together as they could be placed, made her\r\ninspection and care most difficult. There were two rows of\r\nmattresses in the corridors, where two persons could hardly pass\r\nabreast between foot and foot. The mortality, when the _Times_ first\r\ntook up the cause of the sick and wounded, was enormous. In the\r\nCrimea itself there was not half the mortality in the tents,\r\nhorrible as were the sufferings and privations of the men there.\r\n\r\n\"The whole of yesterday,\" writes one of the nurses a few days after\r\nthey had arrived, \"one could only forget one's own existence, for it\r\nwas spent, first in sewing the men's mattresses together, and then\r\nin washing them, and assisting the surgeons, when we could, in\r\ndressing their ghastly wounds after their five days' confinement on\r\nboard ship, during which space their wounds had not been dressed.\r\nHundreds of men with fever, dysentery, and cholera (the wounded were\r\nthe smaller portion) filled the wards in succession, from the\r\novercrowded transports.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale's position was a most difficult one. Everything was\r\nin disorder, and every official was extremely jealous of\r\ninterference. Miss Nightingale, however, at once impressed upon her\r\nstaff the duty of obeying the doctors' orders, as she did herself.\r\nAn invalids' kitchen was established immediately by her to\r\nsupplement the rations. A laundry was added; the nursing itself,\r\nwas, however, the most difficult and important part of the work.\r\n\r\nBut it would take far too much space to give all the details of that\r\nkind but strict administration which brought comparative comfort and\r\na low death-rate into the Scutari hospitals. During a year and a\r\nhalf the labor of getting the hospitals into working order was\r\nenormous, but before the peace arrived they were models of what such\r\ninstitutions may be.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Miss Nightingale in the hospital at Scutari, the _Times_\r\ncorrespondent wrote: \"Wherever there is disease in its most\r\ndangerous form, and the hand of the spoiler distressingly nigh,\r\nthere is that incomparable woman sure to be seen; her benignant\r\npresence is an influence of good comfort even amid the struggles of\r\nexpiring nature. She is a ministering angel, without any\r\nexaggeration, in these hospitals, and as her slender form glides\r\nquietly along each corridor, every poor fellow's face softens with\r\ngratitude at the sight of her. When all the medical officers have\r\nretired for the night, and silence and darkness have settled down\r\nupon these miles of prostrate sick, she may be observed, alone, with\r\na little lamp in her hand, making her solitary rounds. With the\r\nheart of a true woman and the manner of a lady, accomplished and\r\nrefined beyond most of her sex, she combines a surprising calmness\r\nof judgment and promptitude and decision of character. The popular\r\ninstinct was not mistaken, which, when she set out from England on\r\nher mission of mercy, hailed her as a heroine; I trust that she may\r\nnot earn her title to a higher, though sadder, appellation. No one\r\nwho has observed her fragile figure and delicate health can avoid\r\nmisgivings lest these should fail.\"\r\n\r\nPublic feeling bubbled up into poetry. Even doggerel ballads sung\r\nabout the streets praised\r\n\r\n  \"The Nightingale of the East,\r\n   For her heart it means good.\"\r\n\r\nAmong many others, Longfellow wrote the charming poem, \"The Lady\r\nwith the Lamp,\" so beautifully illustrated by the statuette of\r\nFlorence Nightingale at St Thomas's Hospital, suggested by the\r\nwell-known incident recorded in a soldier's letter: \"She would speak\r\nto one and another, and nod and smile to many more; but she could\r\nnot do it to all, you know, for we lay there by hundreds; but we\r\ncould kiss her shadow as it fell, and lay our heads on our pillows\r\nagain, content.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Lo! in that house of misery\r\n  A lady with a lamp I see\r\n      Pass through the glimmering gloom.\r\n      And flit from room to room.\r\n\r\n  \"And slow, as in a dream of bliss,\r\n  The speechless sufferer turns to kiss\r\n      Her shadow as it falls\r\n      Upon the darkening walls.\r\n\r\n  \"On England's annals, through the long\r\n  Hereafter of her speech and song.\r\n      A light its rays shall cast\r\n      From portals of the past.\r\n\r\n  \"A lady with a lamp shall stand\r\n  In the great history of the land.\r\n      A noble type of good\r\n      Heroic womanhood.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following spring Miss Nightingale crossed the Black Sea and\r\nvisited Balaclava, where the state of the hospitals in huts was\r\nextremely distressing, as help of all kinds was even more difficult\r\nto obtain there than at Scutari. Here Miss Nightingale spent some\r\nweeks, until she was prostrated by a severe attack of the Crimean\r\nfever, of which she very nearly died.\r\n\r\nBut at length the Crimean war came to an end. The nation was\r\nprepared to welcome its heroine with the most passionate enthusiasm.\r\nBut Florence Nightingale quietly slipped back unnoticed to her\r\nDerbyshire home, without its being known that she had passed through\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nWorn out with ill-health and fatigue, and naturally shrinking from\r\npublicity, the public at large has scarcely ever seen her; she has\r\nbeen a great invalid ever since the war, and for many years hardly\r\never left her house.\r\n\r\nBut her energy has been untiring. She was one of the founders of the\r\nRed Cross Society for the relief of the sick and wounded in war.\r\nWhen the civil war broke out in America she was consulted as to all\r\nthe details of the military nursing there. \"Her name is almost more\r\nknown among us than even in Europe,\" wrote an American. During the\r\nFranco-German war she gave advice for the chief hospitals under the\r\nCrown Princess, the Princess Alice, and others. The Children's\r\nHospital, at Lisbon, was erected from her plans. The hospitals in\r\nAustralia, India, and other places have received her care. A large\r\nproportion of the plans for the building and organization of the\r\nhospitals erected during the last twenty-five years in England, have\r\npassed through her hands.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, who had followed her work with constant interest,\r\npresented her with a beautiful and costly decoration. The nation\r\ngave £50,000 to found the Nightingale Home. In this home Miss\r\nNightingale takes the deepest interest, constantly having the nurses\r\nand sisters to visit her, and learning from them the most minute\r\ndetails of its working. Great is evidently her rejoicing when one of\r\nher \"Nightingales\" proves to be a really fine nurse, such a one, for\r\ninstance, as Agnes Jones, the reformer of workhouse nursing.\r\n\r\nThis was the high position Florence Nightingale conquered for her\r\nfellow-women. Hundreds have occupied, and are still occupying, the\r\nground she won for them. \"And I give a quarter of a century's\r\nEuropean experience,\" she goes on, \"when I say that the happiest\r\npeople, the fondest of their occupation, the most thankful for their\r\nlives, are, in my opinion, those engaged in sick nursing.\"\r\n\r\nOfficials in high places, ever since the Crimean war, have sent Miss\r\nNightingale piles, mountains one might say, of reports and blue\r\nbooks for her advice. She seems to be able to condense any number of\r\nthem into half a dozen telling sentences; for instance, the\r\nmortality in Indian regiments, during times of peace, became\r\nexceedingly alarming. Reports on the subject were poured in upon\r\nher. \"The men are simply treated like Strasbourg geese,\" she said in\r\neffect. \"They eat, sleep, frizzle in the sun, and eat and sleep\r\nagain. Treat them reasonably, and they will be well.\" She has\r\nwritten much valuable advice on \"How to live and not die in India.\"\r\n\r\nChildren's hospitals have also engaged much of her attention. You\r\ncannot open one of her books at hazard without being struck with\r\nsome shrewd remark, that tells how far-reaching is her observation;\r\nas in this, on the playgrounds of children's hospitals: \"A large\r\ngarden-ground, laid out in sward and grass hillocks, and such ways\r\nas children like (not too pretty, or the children will be scolded\r\nfor spoiling it), must be provided.\"\r\n\r\nHere, I am sorry to find, my space comes to an end, but not, I hope,\r\nbefore I have been able to sketch in some slight way what great\r\nresults will assuredly follow, when Faith and Science are united in\r\none person. In the days, which we may hope are now dawning, when\r\nthese gifts will be united, not in an individual here and there, but\r\nin a large portion of our race, there will doubtless be many a\r\ndevoted woman whose knowledge may equal her practical skill, and her\r\nlove for God and her fellow-creatures, who will understand, even\r\nmore thoroughly than most of us now can (most of us being still so\r\nignorant), how deep a debt of gratitude is due to her who first\r\nopened for women so many paths of duty, and raised nursing from a\r\nmenial employment to the dignity of an \"Art of Charity\"--to\r\nEngland's first great nurse, the wise, beloved, and far-seeing\r\nheroine of the Crimean war, the Lady of the Lamp, Florence\r\nNightingale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. LOUIS PASTEUR[21]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 21: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy Dr. CYRUS EDSON\r\n\r\n(1822-1895)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. Louis Pasteur.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Pasteur, the Columbus of \"the world of the infinitely\r\nlittle\"--to quote the phrase of Professor Dumas--was born in the\r\ntown of Dôle, France, on December 27, 1822. His father was an old\r\nsoldier, decorated on the field of battle, who, after leaving the\r\narray, earned his bread as a tanner. In 1825 M. Pasteur moved from\r\nDôle to the town of Arbois, on the borders of the Cuisance, where\r\nhis son began his education in the communal college. The boy was\r\nexceedingly fond of fishing and of sketching, and it was not until\r\nhe reached the age of fourteen that he began study in earnest. There\r\nbeing no professor of philosophy at Arbois, Louis Pasteur moved to\r\nBesançon, where he received the degree of _bachelier ès lettres_ and\r\nwas at once appointed as one of the tutors. Here he studied the\r\ncourse in mathematics necessary for admission into the École\r\nNormale, in Paris, which he entered in October, 1843. Already his\r\npassion for chemistry had shown itself, and he took the lectures in\r\nthat science delivered by M. Dumas at the Sorbonne, and by M. Balard\r\nat the École Normale. It was but a short time before he became a\r\nmarked man in his class, especially for his intense devotion to\r\nexperiment. Thanks to M. Delafosse, one of the lecturers of the\r\nÉcole Normale, his attention was turned to crystallography, and a\r\nnote from the German chemist, Mitscherlich, communicated to the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, set him on fire with curiosity. Mitscherlich\r\ndeclared: \"The paratartrate and the tartrate of soda and ammonia\r\nhave the same chemical composition, the same crystalline form, the\r\nsame angles, the same specific weight, the same double refraction,\r\nand the same inclination of the optic axes. Dissolved in water,\r\ntheir refraction is the same. But while the dissolved tartrate\r\ncauses the plane of polarized light to rotate, the paratartrate\r\nexacts no such action.\"\r\n\r\nPasteur at once instituted experiments resulting in the discovery of\r\nminute facets in the tartrate which gave it the power noted. He\r\nfound in the paratartrate these facets existed, but that there was\r\nan equal admixture of right-and left-handed crystals, and the one\r\nneutralized the effect of the other. He also discovered the\r\nleft-handed tartrate. These discoveries at the opening of Pasteur's\r\ncareer brought him at once to the front among the scientific men. He\r\nfollowed them with a profound investigation into the symmetry and\r\ndissymmetry of atoms, and reached the conclusion that in these lay\r\nthe basic difference between inorganic and organic matter, between\r\nthe absence of life and life.\r\n\r\nNominated at the age of thirty-two as Dean of the Faculté des\r\nSciences, at Lille, Pasteur determined to devote a portion of his\r\nlectures to fermentation. At that time ferments were believed to be,\r\nto quote Liebig, \"Nitrogenous substances--albumin, fibrin, casein;\r\nor the liquids which embrace them--milk, blood, urine--in a state of\r\nalteration which they undergo in contact with air.\" Pasteur examined\r\nthe lactic ferment and found little rods, 1/25000 inch in length,\r\nwhich nipped themselves in the centre, divided into two, grew to\r\nfull length and divided again, and these living things he declared\r\nto be the active principles of the ferment. He made a mixture of\r\nyeast, chalk, sugar, and water, added some of the rods, and got\r\nfermentation. He then made a mixture of sugar, water, phosphate of\r\npotash, and magnesia, and introducing fresh cells, fermentation\r\nfollowed. Liebig's theory of the nitrogenous character of the\r\nferment disappeared when fermentation was caused in a mixture having\r\nno nitrogenous elements.\r\n\r\nPasteur had discovered that fermentation was a phenomenon of\r\nnutrition; it followed the increase and growth of the little rods.\r\nThe next step was the discovery of the ferment of butyric acid, a\r\nspecies of vibrio consisting of little rods united in chains of two\r\nor three and possessed of movement. He found these vibrios lived\r\nwithout air. Further experiments showed there were ferments to which\r\nair was necessary, called by Pasteur the _ærobics_, and others to\r\nwhom oxygen was fatal, the _anærobics_. He proved, also, by an\r\nexhaustive series of experiments, that what is called putrefaction\r\nof animal matter is the result of the combined work of the _ærobics_\r\nand the _anærobics_, which reduce that part not taken up by oxygen\r\nto dead organic matter, ready in its turn to form food for living\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nHis attention having been turned to the needs of the vinegar makers\r\nof Orleans, Pasteur began the examination of the ferment which\r\nproduces vinegar from wine. He found this in the mycoderm aceto, a\r\nmould-like plant which has the power of developing acetic acid from\r\nalcohol. As the result of his investigation, the manufacturers of\r\nvinegar in France were able to do away with the cumbrous process\r\nthey had long followed, and to make vinegar, not only more cheaply,\r\nbut of very much better quality. But during these experiments\r\nPasteur found the temperature of 65° C. was sufficient to kill the\r\nmycoderm. When, then, the wine makers of France appealed to him to\r\ninvestigate the \"diseases\" of wine, he was ready for the work.\r\n\r\nBefore this, however, he had examined the claims of Pouchet and\r\nothers to their alleged discovery of spontaneous generation; in\r\nother words, the production of life. Ranging himself against them,\r\nPasteur showed their experiments not to have been conclusive, simply\r\nbecause they had not succeeded in excluding the dust which contained\r\ngerms of life in the shape of spores of microscopic plants.\r\n\r\nThe \"diseases\" of wine produce sour wine, wine that \"spirits,\"\r\n\"greasy\" wine, and bitter wine. Pasteur found each to be due to a\r\ndifferent microscopic ferment, all of which could be killed by heat.\r\nHe placed bottles of wine in a bath heated to 60° C., and invited\r\nthe most experienced wine tasters of Paris to try them afterward.\r\nThe result of the test was the unanimous verdict that the wines had\r\nnot been injured in the least, and to-day these \"diseases\" of wine\r\nare a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThere are departments in France where the culture of the silk-worm\r\nis the principal industry of the inhabitants. In 1849 a strange\r\ndisease, called pebrine, broke out among the worms; they were unable\r\nto moult and died before the cocoons were spun. It spread in the\r\nmost alarming manner until, from a crop with an average of one\r\nhundred and thirty million francs a year, the production of silk\r\nwent to less than fifty millions. The silk cultivators sent for\r\neggs--seed is the technical name--to Italy and Greece, and for one\r\nseason all went well. The next, the plague was as bad as ever. More\r\nthan that, it spread to Italy, Spain, Greece, and Turkey, until\r\nJapan was the only silk-producing country where the worm was\r\nhealthy. Societies and governments, as well as individuals, were\r\naghast, for the silk industry of the world was on the verge of\r\nannihilation, and every remedy the mind of man could conceive was\r\ntried, only to be rejected. In France alone the loss in 1865 was\r\nover one hundred million francs.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Professor Dumas, the Government induced Pasteur\r\nto examine into the \"disease.\" He had seen in a report on the\r\nepidemic made by M. de Quatrefages, that there were found in the\r\ndiseased worms certain minute corpuscles only to be seen under the\r\nmicroscope. When in June, 1865, Pasteur arrived in the town of\r\nAlais, he found these corpuscles without difficulty. He traced them\r\nfrom the worm to the chrysalid, in the cocoon, and thence to the\r\nmoth; he found worms hatched from the eggs laid by these moths\r\ninvariably developed the corpuscles. He crushed a corpuscular moth\r\nin water, painted a mulberry leaf with it, fed it to a healthy worm,\r\nand the corpuscles developed. He hatched eggs from moths free from\r\ncorpuscles and secured healthy worms. While working on the\r\n\"disease,\" Pasteur discovered in 1867 that the mortality among the\r\nworms was in part due to another disease, the _flacherie_, and this\r\nhe found was the result of imperfect digestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pasteur in his Laboratory.]\r\n\r\n_Flacherie_ was contagious, and was caused by the fermentation of the\r\nfood eaten in the body of the worm. The causes of this fermentation,\r\nthe condition of the leaves, the temperature, and others were pointed\r\nout. As the result of five years' work, Pasteur had restored the silk\r\nindustry to its former position, and had shown that the microscopic\r\nexamination of the moth laying the eggs to be hatched was a perfect\r\nsafeguard against _pebrine_ and _flacherie_.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the emperor, Pasteur went to the Villa Vicentia,\r\nin Austria, belonging to the prince imperial. For ten years the silk\r\nharvest there had not paid the cost of the eggs.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was just recovering from an attack of paralysis brought\r\non by overwork, Pasteur travelled to Austria, introduced his methods\r\nand the sale of the cocoons gave the villa a net profit of\r\n26,000,000 francs. No wonder it was said of him that his discoveries\r\nalone exceeded in money value to the French people the war indemnity\r\npaid by them to the Germans.\r\n\r\nSplenic fever, called _charbon_ in France, had for years decimated\r\nthe flocks in France, Italy, Russia, Egypt, Hungary, and Brazil. It\r\nattacked the horse and cow as well as the sheep, and human beings\r\ndied of it when they developed malignant pustule. Many scientific\r\nmen had studied it, but Dr. Davaine, in 1850, was the first to find\r\nin the blood of a sheep that had died of the disease, \"little\r\nthread-like bodies about twice the length of a blood-corpuscle.\r\nThese little bodies exhibit no spontaneous motion.\"\r\n\r\nPasteur began the examination of splenic fever by securing some of\r\nthe blood from an animal dying from it. In the work before him he\r\nassociated with himself M. Joubert, one of his former pupils. A drop\r\nof the blood sown in the water of yeast--the medium used for\r\ncultures by Pasteur at that time--produced myriads of the rods, the\r\nbacilli or microbes. A drop of this taken at the end of twenty-four\r\nhours, and placed in a fresh flask of the medium, again produced\r\nthousands of the bacilli. Pasteur found that guinea-pigs inoculated\r\nfrom the first flask developed the fever, and the same result\r\nfollowed when the inoculation was from the twentieth. He had proved,\r\nthen, that splenic fever was produced by the bacilli, by living\r\norganisms only to be seen with a powerful microscope.\r\n\r\nWhile working on the bacilli of splenic fever, Pasteur had isolated\r\nthe bacillus of chicken cholera, had cultivated it and had\r\ninoculated chickens with it, developing the disease. He found that\r\nso long as the cultures were made from flask to flask within\r\ntwenty-four hours, the virus of the disease, that is, the power of\r\nthe bacilli to produce cholera in the fowls inoculated, remained the\r\nsame and the fowl died. But he discovered that if a flask containing\r\nthe bacilli were left exposed to the air for two weeks, and the\r\nfowls were then inoculated with bacilli from this flask, they became\r\nsick, but did not die. Following this up, he inoculated a hen that\r\nhad recovered from a sickness so produced, with the bacilli in their\r\nstrongest and most virulent form, and the hen showed no effect\r\nwhatever. Then he took two hens, one fresh from the coop and the\r\nother well again after the sickness produced by the inoculation with\r\nthe exposed bacilli, and inoculated both with the blood of a hen\r\nthat was dying of chicken cholera. The first died, the second was\r\naffected. In other words, Pasteur had made the greatest discovery in\r\nphysiology of this century. He had found it is possible to attenuate\r\nthe virus of a virulent disease, and to use that virus so attenuated\r\nas a vaccine matter which will guard the animal vaccinated against\r\nthe disease. He had taken Jenner's discovery, and proved it applied\r\nto other diseases besides small-pox.\r\n\r\nPasteur's theory of the reason why any vaccine matter will have its\r\nprophylactic effect, is this: He believes there is in the blood of\r\nany animal subject to a disease caused by bacilli some substance\r\nwhich is necessary to the sustenance of those bacilli; and when the\r\nbacilli, having an attenuated virus, are introduced, they slowly\r\nconsume all of this substance.\r\n\r\nThe substance being one which nature creates very slowly, no\r\nsubsequent introduction of the bacilli, however virulent, can\r\nproduce the disease until such time shall have elapsed that a new\r\nsupply of the substance shall have been secreted. In this way he\r\naccounts for the fact that vaccination will protect from small-pox\r\nfor a more or less defined period of time.\r\n\r\nPasteur hastened to apply his discovery of the attenuation of the\r\nvirus of chicken cholera to the virus of splenic fever. Here,\r\nhowever, he was met with a serious difficulty. The microbes of\r\nsplenic fever, if left in the flask for forty-eight hours, developed\r\nbright spots, and gradually into these spots the bacilli themselves\r\nseemed to be absorbed. Pasteur found these spots were the spores or\r\nseeds of the microbes, and he also found that, while the bacilli\r\ncould be killed easily in various ways, the spores possessed a much\r\ngreater resistance. They could be dried, for example, and preserved\r\nin that state indefinitely. It was apparent that the oxygenation\r\nwhich attenuated the venom of the bacilli of chicken cholera was\r\nimpossible with those of splenic fever if the bacilli of the latter\r\ndisappeared within a week, leaving the spores behind. But Pasteur\r\nhad discovered before this that, unless the temperature of a fowl\r\nwere lowered artificially, inoculation with the microbes of splenic\r\nfever would not produce the disease. From this he argued that, as\r\nthe heat of the fowl's body was sufficient to resist the contagion,\r\nthe bacilli themselves must be extremely sensitive to variations in\r\ntemperature. He tried the experiment and found, by lowering the\r\ntemperature of the flasks containing the cultures, he could prevent\r\nthe formation of the spores. He then attenuated the venom of the\r\nsplenic bacilli as he had that of the fowl cholera, tried it on\r\nguinea-pigs, found they became sick and recovered; inoculated them\r\nwith the bacilli of full strength, but with no result. Pursuing his\r\nexperiments, he discovered that he could by using vaccine-attenuated\r\nbacilli, of unequal strength, cause any degree of sickness he\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1881 Pasteur agreed to hold a public exhibition\r\nof his vaccine for splenic fever, the animals to be supplied by the\r\nSociety of Agriculture in Melun. The experiment was begun on May\r\n5th. Pasteur inoculated twenty-four sheep, one goat, and six cows\r\nwith six drops each of attenuated virus, and twelve days afterward\r\nhe reinoculated them with a stronger virus. On May 31st he\r\nreinoculated the thirty-one animals with the strongest virus of\r\nsplenic fever, and at the same time inoculated twenty-five sheep and\r\nfour cows which had not been vaccinated as were the others. On June\r\n2d over two hundred people assembled at the farm to see the result.\r\nThe twenty-five sheep that had not been vaccinated all died before\r\nthat evening. The non-vaccinated cows had intense fever and great\r\nswellings, and could scarcely stand up. On the other hand, the\r\nvaccinated sheep and cows were in full health and were feeding\r\nquietly. Pasteur had conquered splenic fever.\r\n\r\nHaving attenuated the virus of these bacilli, Pasteur began a series\r\nof experiments to determine whether the attenuated virus could be\r\nintensified until its former venom was obtained. This he succeeded\r\nin, and thus discovered what is probably the key to the solution of\r\nthe problem of the periodicity of epidemics of contagious diseases,\r\nsuch as cholera. In 1882 Pasteur's attention was called to a new\r\ndisease, swine fever (_rouget_), which was ravaging the herds of\r\nswine in France. He found the microbes, attenuated them, vaccinated\r\nthe pigs, and secured the most favorable results. He also discovered\r\nthat by passing the microbe of a disease through an animal not\r\nsubject to that disease, he attenuated it so far as its effects on\r\nanother were concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1880 that Pasteur first began his experiments in\r\nhydrophobia. Securing the saliva of a child suffering from the\r\ndisease, he inoculated rabbits with it and they died in thirty-six\r\nhours. He examined the saliva and the blood of the rabbits, and\r\nfound in both a new microbe (a minute disk having two points). He\r\nestablished by repeated experiments that hydrophobia is a disease of\r\nthe nerves, that a portion of the medulla oblongata, or of the\r\nspinal cord, is very much more certain to produce the disease, when\r\nintroduced into the blood or placed on the brain, than is the\r\nsaliva. He succeeded at last in isolating the microbe, in making\r\ncultures of it, and then attenuating it, and in May, 1884, he\r\nproduced before a commission appointed by the Minister of Public\r\nInstruction the following results:\r\n\r\nOf six dogs unprotected by vaccination, three died as the results of\r\nbites of a dog violently mad. Of eight unvaccinated dogs, six died\r\nafter extra-venous inoculation of rabic matter. Of five unvaccinated\r\ndogs, all died after inoculation, by trepanning, of the brain with\r\nrabic matter. Of twenty-three vaccinated dogs, not one was attacked\r\nwith the disease after inoculation, in any fashion, with the most\r\nvirulent rabic matter procurable.\r\n\r\nDuring his long and busy life Louis Pasteur has been honored after\r\nevery fashion known to men. He has opened the gates of knowledge\r\nwider than they were ever opened before, and in his discovery of the\r\ngerms of disease, and in his still more wonderful discovery of the\r\npossibility of attenuating those germs and converting them into\r\nvaccines, he has revolutionized all ideas of physiology. He is one\r\nof the greatest pioneers in science that has ever lived, and his\r\nwork will make his name illustrious so long as men shall continue on\r\nthis earth. The lesson of his life is the supreme value of\r\nexperiment; for, as was once said of him by Professor Dumas,\r\n\"Pasteur is never mistaken, because he never asserts anything he\r\ncannot show another man how to prove.\"\r\n\r\n[Signature: Cyrus Edson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARLES GEORGE GORDON\r\n\r\nBy Colonel R. H. VEITCH, R.E.\r\n\r\n1833-1885\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Charles George Gordon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles George Gordon, known as Chinese Gordon, major-general, C.B.,\r\nroyal engineers, fourth son of Lieutenant-general Henry William\r\nGordon, royal artillery, and Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Enderby,\r\nof Croom's Hill, Blackheath, was born at Woolwich on January 28,\r\n1833. He was sent to school at Taunton in 1843, and entered the\r\nRoyal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1848. He obtained a commission\r\nin the royal engineers on June 23, 1852, and, after the usual course\r\nof study at Chatham was quartered for a short time at Pembroke Dock.\r\nIn December, 1854, he received his orders for the Crimea, and\r\nreached Balaklava on January 1, 1855. As a young engineer subaltern\r\nserving in the trenches, his daring was conspicuous, while his\r\nspecial aptitude for obtaining a personal knowledge of the movements\r\nof the enemy was a matter of common observation among his brother\r\nofficers. He was wounded on June 6, 1855, and was present at the\r\nattack on the Redan on June 18th. On the surrender of Sebastopol\r\nGordon accompanied the expedition to Kinburn, and on his return was\r\nemployed on the demolition of the Sebastopol docks. For his services\r\nin the Crimea Gordon received the British war medal and clasp, the\r\nTurkish war medal, and the French Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1856, in company with lieutenant (now major-general) E. R.\r\nJames, R.E., he joined Colonel (now General Sir) E. Stanton, R.E.,\r\nin Bessarabia, as assistant commissioner for the delimitation of the\r\nnew frontier line. This duty was completed in April, 1857, and he\r\nwas then sent with Lieutenant James in a similar capacity to\r\nErzeroum, where Colonel (now General Sir) Lintorn Simmons was the\r\nEnglish commissioner for the Asiatic frontier boundary. The work was\r\naccomplished by the following October, when Gordon returned to\r\nEngland. In the spring of 1858 he and Lieutenant James were sent as\r\ncommissioners to the Armenian frontier to superintend the erection\r\nof the boundary posts of the line they had previously surveyed. This\r\nwas finished in November, and Gordon returned home, having acquired\r\nan intimate knowledge of the people of the districts visited.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1859, Gordon was promoted captain, and about the same\r\ntime appointed second adjutant of the corps at Chatham, a post he\r\nheld for little more than a year, for, in the summer of 1860, he\r\njoined the forces of Sir James Hope Grant, operating with the French\r\nagainst China. He overtook the allied army at Tientsin, and was\r\npresent in October at the capture of Pekin and the pillage and\r\ndestruction of the emperor's summer palace. For his services in this\r\ncampaign he received the British war medal with clasp for Pekin and\r\na brevet majority in December, 1862. Gordon commanded the royal\r\nengineers at Tientsin, when the British forces remained there under\r\nSir Charles Staveley, and while thus employed made several\r\nexpeditions into the interior, in one of which he explored a\r\nconsiderable section of the great wall of China. In April, 1862, he\r\nwas summoned to Shanghai to assist in the operations consequent upon\r\nthe determination of Sir Charles Staveley to keep a radius of thirty\r\nmiles round the city clear of the rebel Taipings. Gordon took part\r\nas commanding royal engineer, in the storming of Sing-poo and\r\nseveral other fortified towns and in clearing the rebels out of\r\nKah-ding. He was afterward employed in surveying the country round\r\nShanghai.\r\n\r\nThe Taiping rebellion was of so barbarous a nature that its suppression\r\nhad become necessary in the interest of civilization. A force raised at\r\nthe expense of the Shanghai merchants, and supported by the Chinese\r\nGovernment, had been for some years struggling against its prowess. This\r\nforce, known as the \"Ever Victorious Army,\" was defeated at Taitsan,\r\nFebruary 22, 1863. Li Hung Chang, governor-general of the Kiang\r\nprovinces, then applied to the British commander-in-chief for the\r\nservices of an English officer, and Gordon was authorized to accept the\r\ncommand. He arrived at Sung Kiong and entered on his new duties as a\r\nmandarin and lieutenant-colonel in the Chinese service on March 24,\r\n1863. His force was composed of some three to four thousand Chinese,\r\nofficered by 150 Europeans of almost every nationality and often of\r\ndoubtful character. By the indomitable will of its commander this\r\nheterogeneous body was moulded into a little army, whose high-sounding\r\ntitle of \"Ever Victorious\" became a reality, and in less than two years,\r\nafter thirty-three engagements, the power of the Taipings was completely\r\nbroken and the rebellion stamped out. The maintenance of discipline was\r\na perpetual struggle, and at one time there was a mutiny which was only\r\nquelled by shooting the ringleader on the spot. Before the summer of\r\n1863 was over, Gordon captured Kahpoo, Wokong, and Patachiaow, on the\r\nsouth of Soo-chow, the great rebel stronghold, and, sweeping round to\r\nthe north, secured Leeku, Wanti, and Fusaiqwan, so that by October\r\nSoo-chow was completely invested. On November 29th the outworks were\r\ncaptured by assault and the city surrendered on December 6th. Gordon was\r\nalways in front in all these storming parties, carrying no other weapon\r\nthan a little cane. His men called it his \"magic wand,\" regarding it as\r\na charm that protected his life and led them on to victory.\r\n\r\nWhen Soo-chow fell, Gordon had stipulated with the governor-general,\r\nLi, for the lives of the Wangs (rebel leaders). They were\r\ntreacherously murdered by Li's orders. Indignant at this perfidy,\r\nGordon refused to serve any longer with Governor Li, and when on\r\nJanuary 1, 1864, money and rewards were heaped upon him by the\r\nemperor, declined them all, saying that he received the approbation\r\nof the emperor with every gratification, but regretted most\r\nsincerely that, \"owing to the circumstances which occurred since the\r\ncapture of Soo-chow, he was unable to receive any mark of his\r\nmajesty the emperor's recognition.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some months of inaction it became evident that if Gordon did\r\nnot again take the field the Taipings would regain the rescued\r\ncountry. On the urgent representations of the British envoy at\r\nPekin, Governor Li was compelled to issue a proclamation exonerating\r\nGordon from all complicity in the murder of the Wangs. Gordon then\r\nreluctantly consented to continue his services, on the distinct\r\nunderstanding that in any future capitulation he should not be\r\ninterfered with. In December, 1863, a fresh campaign was commenced,\r\nand during the following months no fewer than seven towns were\r\ncaptured or surrendered. In February, 1864, Yesing and Liyang were\r\ntaken, but at Kintang Gordon met with a reverse and was himself\r\nwounded for the first time. He nevertheless continued to give his\r\norders until he had to be carried to his boat. After some other\r\nmishaps he carried Chan-chu-fu by assault on April 27th. The\r\ngarrison consisted of 20,000 men, of whom 1,500 were killed. This\r\nvictory not only ended the campaign but completely destroyed the\r\nrebellion, and the Chinese regular forces were enabled to occupy\r\nNankin in the July following. The large money present offered to\r\nGordon by the emperor was again declined, although he had spent his\r\npay promoting the efficiency of his force, so that he wrote home, \"I\r\nshall leave China as poor as when I entered it.\" The emperor,\r\nhowever, bestowed upon him the yellow jacket, and peacock's feather\r\nof a mandarin of the first class, with the title of Ti-Tu, the\r\nhighest military rank in China, and a gold medal of distinction of\r\nthe first class. The merchants of Shanghai presented him with an\r\naddress expressing their admiration of his conduct of the war.\r\n\r\nOn his return home, in the beginning of 1865, he was made a C.B.,\r\nhaving previously received his brevet as lieutenant-colonel in\r\nFebruary, 1864. In September, 1865, he was appointed commanding\r\nroyal engineer at Gravesend, and for the next six years carried out\r\nthe ordinary duties of the corps, superintending the construction of\r\nthe forts for the defence of the Thames. During this quiet and\r\nuneventful period of routine work he devoted his spare time to the\r\npoor and sick of the neighborhood, stinting himself that he might\r\nhave larger means wherewith to relieve others. He took special\r\ninterest in the infirmary and the ragged schools. He took many of\r\nthe boys from the schools into his own house, starting them in life\r\nby sending them to sea, and he continued to watch the future\r\nprogress of his kings, as he called them, with never-failing\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1871, Gordon was appointed British member of the\r\ninternational commission at Galatz for the improvement of the\r\nnavigation of the Sulina mouth of the Danube, in accordance with\r\nthe Treaty of Paris. During his tenure of this office he accompanied\r\nGeneral Sir John Adye to the Crimea to report on the British\r\ncemeteries there. On his way back to Galatz, in November, 1872, he\r\nmet Nubar Pasha at Constantinople, who sounded him as to his\r\nsucceeding Sir Samuel Baker in the Soudan. The following year Gordon\r\nvisited Cairo on his way home, and on the resignation of Sir Samuel\r\nBaker was appointed governor of the equatorial provinces of Central\r\nAfrica, with a salary of £10,000 a year. He declined to receive more\r\nthan £2,000.\r\n\r\nGordon went to Egypt in the beginning of 1874, and left Cairo in\r\nFebruary for Gondokoro, the seat of his government, travelling by\r\nthe Suez-Swakin-Berber route. He reached Khartoum on March 13th,\r\nstopped only a few days to issue a proclamation and make\r\narrangements for men and supplies, then, continuing his journey,\r\narrived at Gondokoro on April 16th. The garrison of Gondokoro at\r\nthis time did not dare to move out of the place except in armed\r\nbands; but in the course of a year the confidence of the natives had\r\nbeen gained, the country made safe, eight stations formed and\r\ngarrisoned, the government monopoly of ivory enforced, and\r\nsufficient money sent to Cairo to pay all the expenses of the\r\nexpedition. At the close of the year, having already lost by\r\nsickness eight members of his small European staff, Gordon\r\ntransferred the seat of government from the unhealthy station,\r\nGondokoro, to Laido. By the end of 1875 Gondokoro and Duffh had been\r\njoined by a chain of fortified posts, a day's journey apart, the\r\nslave-dealers had been dispersed, and a letter post organized to\r\ntravel regularly between Cairo and the verge of the Albert Nyanza,\r\nover two thousand miles as the crow flies.\r\n\r\nGordon had also visited Magungo, Murchison Falls, and Chibero, with\r\na view to a further line of fortified posts, and he established for\r\nthe first time, by personal observation, the course of the Victoria\r\nNile into Lake Albert. Although he had accomplished a great work\r\nsince his arrival, his efforts to put down the slave trade were\r\nthwarted by Ismail Pasha Yacoub, governor-general of the Soudan, and\r\nwere likely to prove abortive so long as the Soudan remained a\r\ndistinct government from that of the equatorial provinces. He,\r\ntherefore, at the end of 1876, resigned his appointment and returned\r\nto England. Strong pressure was put upon him by the khédive to\r\nreturn, and on January 31, 1877, he left for Cairo, where he\r\nreceived the combined appointment of governor-general of the Soudan,\r\nDarfour, the equatorial provinces, and the Red Sea littoral, on the\r\nunderstanding that his efforts were to be directed to the\r\nimprovement of the means of communication and the absolute\r\nsuppression of the slave trade. Gordon first visited Abyssinia,\r\nwhere Walad el Michael was giving a great deal of trouble on the\r\nEgyptian frontier. He settled the difficulty for a time and\r\ntravelled across country to Khartoum, where he was installed as\r\ngovernor-general, May 5th. After a short stay there he hastened to\r\nDarfour, which was in revolt; with a small force and rapid movements\r\nhe quelled the rising, and, by the humane consideration he showed\r\nfor the suffering people, won their confidence and pacified the\r\nprovince. Before this work was completely accomplished his attention\r\nwas called away by the slave-dealers, who, headed by Suleiman, son\r\nof the notorious Zebehr, with 6,000 armed men, had moved on Dara\r\nfrom their stronghold, Shaka. Gordon left Fischer on August 31,\r\n1877, with a small escort, which he soon outstripped, and in a day\r\nand a half, having covered eighty-five miles on a camel, entered\r\nDara alone, to the surprise of its small garrison. The following\r\nmorning, attended by a small escort, he rode into the rebel camp,\r\nupbraided Suleiman with his disloyalty, and announced his intention\r\nto disarm the band and break them up. Gordon's fearless bearing and\r\nstrong will secured his object, and Suleiman returned with his men\r\nto Shaka.\r\n\r\nThey rose again; and Gordon's Italian aide, Gessi, after a year's\r\nmarching and fighting, succeeded in capturing Suleiman, and some of\r\nthe chief slave-dealers with him. They were tried as rebels and\r\nshot. The suppression of the slave trade had thus been practically\r\naccomplished when on July 1st news arrived of the deposition of\r\nIsmail and the succession of Tewfik, which determined Gordon to\r\nresign his appointment. On arriving at Cairo, the khédive induced\r\nhim first to undertake a mission to Abyssinia to prevent, if\r\npossible, an impending war with that country. Gordon went, saw King\r\nJohn, at Debra Tabor, but could arrive at no satisfactory\r\nunderstanding with him, and was abruptly dismissed. On his way to\r\nKassala he was made prisoner to King John's men and carried to\r\nGarramudhiri, where he was left to find his way with his little\r\nparty over the snowy mountains to the Red Sea. He reached Massowah\r\non December 8, 1879, and on his return to Cairo, the khédive\r\naccepted his resignation. He arrived in England early in January,\r\n1880. During his service under the khédive, Gordon received both the\r\nsecond-and first-class of the order of the Medjidieh.\r\n\r\nHis constitution was so much impaired by his sojournings in so\r\ndeadly a climate that his medical advisers sent him to Switzerland\r\nto recruit. He returned to England, in April, 1880, and in the\r\nfollowing month accompanied the Marquis of Ripon, the new Viceroy of\r\nIndia, to that country as his private secretary. He resigned almost\r\nimmediately, and was invited to China to advise the Chinese\r\nGovernment in connection with their then strained relations with\r\nRussia. Gordon accepted at once, and although difficulties were\r\nraised by the home authorities, he reached Hongkong on July 2d, and\r\nwent on by Shanghai and Chefoo to Tientsin to meet his old friend,\r\nLi Hung Chang, who, with Prince Kung, headed the peace party. From\r\nTientsin, Gordon went to Pekin, and his wise and disinterested\r\ncounsels in favor of peace at length carried the day.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 he went to Mauritius as commanding royal engineer, and while\r\nthere was promoted major-general. In 1882, he was at the Cape\r\nColony, endeavoring to arrange a peace with the natives of\r\nBasutoland; but he failed, largely through the treachery of the Cape\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gordon attacked by El Mahdi's Arabs.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the Mahdi in the Soudan and the catastrophe to Hicks\r\nPasha, in November, 1883, had induced the British Government, not\r\nonly to decline any military assistance to enable the Egyptian\r\nGovernment to hold the Soudan, but to insist upon its abandonment by\r\nthe khédive. To do this it was necessary to bring away the garrisons\r\nscattered all over the country, and such of the Egyptian\r\npopulation as might object to remain. To Gordon was intrusted the\r\nwithdrawal of the garrisons and the evacuation of the Soudan. At\r\nCairo his functions were considerably extended. He was appointed,\r\nwith the consent of the British Government, governor-general of the\r\nSoudan, and was instructed, not only to effect the evacuation of the\r\ncountry, but to take steps to leave behind an organized independent\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nBy the month of March, having succeeded in sending some two thousand\r\nfive hundred people down the Nile into safety, Gordon found himself\r\ngetting hemmed in by the Mahdi and no assistance coming from\r\nwithout. On April 16, 1884, his last telegram before the wires were\r\ncut complained bitterly of the neglect of the Government. The attack\r\nof Khartoum began on March 12th, and from that time to its fall\r\nGordon carried on the defence with consummate skill. His resources\r\nwere small, his troops few, and his European assistants could be\r\ncounted on the fingers of one hand; yet he managed to convert his\r\nriver steamers into iron-clads, to build new ones, to make and lay\r\ndown land mines, to place wire entanglements, and to execute\r\nfrequent sorties, while he kept up the spirits and courage of his\r\nfollowers by striking medals in honor of their bravery, and baffled\r\na fanatic and determined foe for over ten months, during the latter\r\npart of which the people who trusted him were perishing from disease\r\nand famine, and the grip of the enemy was tightening.\r\n\r\nIn April the necessity of a relief expedition was pressed upon the\r\nGovernment at home, but without avail. In May popular feeling found\r\nvent, not only in public meetings but in the House of Commons, when\r\na vote of censure on the Government was lost by only twenty-eight\r\nvotes. Eventually, proposals were made to send a relief expedition\r\nfrom Cairo in the autumn, and on August 5th a vote of credit for\r\n£300,000 was taken for \"operations for the relief of General Gordon,\r\nshould it become necessary, and to make certain preparations in\r\nrespect thereof.\" Even when it was decided that Lord Wolseley should\r\ntake command of a relief expedition up the Nile, hesitation\r\ncontinued to mark the proceedings of the Government, and time, so\r\nvaluable on account of the rising of the Nile, was lost. It was\r\nSeptember 1st before Lord Wolseley was able to leave England. Then\r\neverything was done, but the delay had been fatal.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1884, having driven the rebels out of Berber, Gordon\r\nauthorized his companions, Colonel Stewart and Frank Power (_Times_\r\ncorrespondent), to go down the river in the steamer Abbas to open\r\ncommunication with Dongola. The steamer struck on a rock, and they\r\nwere both treacherously murdered. Gordon was now the only Englishman\r\nin Khartoum. On December 20th, Lord Wolseley launched Sir Herbert\r\nStewart's expedition from Korti across the desert to Metemmeh,\r\nwhere, after two severe engagements, it arrived on January 20, 1885,\r\nunder command of Sir Charles Wilson, Stewart having been mortally\r\nwounded. In order to succor the advancing force, Gordon had deprived\r\nhimself for three months of five out of his seven steamers. These\r\nfive steamers, fully armed, equipped, and provisioned, were in\r\nwaiting, and in them were his diaries and letters up to December\r\n14th. On that date he wrote to Major Watson, R.E., at Cairo, that\r\nhe thought the game was up, and a catastrophe might be expected in\r\nten days' time, and sent his adieux to all. On the same day he wrote\r\nto his sister: \"I am quite happy, thank God, and like Lawrence, I\r\nhave tried to do my duty.\" His diary ended on the same day with: \"I\r\nhave done the best for the honor of my country. Good-by.\" It was\r\nnecessary for the safety of his troops that Wilson should first make\r\na reconnoissance down the river toward Berber before going to\r\nKhartoum, and when he started up the river, on January 24th, the\r\ndifficulties of navigation were so great that it was midday on the\r\n28th before the goal was reached, and then only to find it in the\r\nhands of the Mahdi, Khartoum having fallen early on the 26th, after\r\na siege of 317 days.\r\n\r\nFrom the most accurate information since obtained, it appears that\r\nthe garrison, early in January, had been reduced to great straits\r\nfor want of food, and great numbers of the inhabitants had availed\r\nthemselves of Gordon's permission to join the Mahdi. Omdurman,\r\nopposite to Khartoum, on the west bank of the river, fell about\r\nJanuary 13th, and about the 18th a sortie was made, in which some\r\nserious fighting took place. The state of the garrison then grew\r\ndesperate. Gordon continually visited the posts by night as well as\r\nday, and encouraged the famished garrison. The news of Sir Herbert\r\nStewart's expedition, and the successful engagements it had fought\r\non the way to Metemmeh, determined the Mahdi to storm Khartoum\r\nbefore reinforcements could arrive for its relief. The attack was\r\nmade on the south front at 3.30 a.m., on Monday, January 26, 1885.\r\nThe defence was half-hearted, treachery was at work, and Gordon\r\nreceived no tidings of the assault. The rebels made good their\r\nentrance, and then a general massacre ensued. The accounts of\r\nGordon's death are confused and conflicting, but they all agree in\r\nstating that he was killed near the gate of the palace, and his head\r\ncarried to the Mahdi's camp.\r\n\r\nIntelligence of the catastrophe reached England on Thursday,\r\nFebruary 5th. The outburst of popular grief, not only in this\r\ncountry and her colonies, but also among foreign nations, has hardly\r\nbeen paralleled. It was universally acknowledged that the world had\r\nlost a hero. Friday, March 13th, was then observed as a day of\r\nnational mourning, and special services were held in the cathedrals\r\nand in many churches of the land, those at Westminster Abbey and St.\r\nPaul's being attended by the royal family, members of both houses of\r\nparliament, and representatives of the naval and military services.\r\nParliament voted a national monument to be placed in Trafalgar\r\nSquare, and a sum of £20,000 to his relatives. More general\r\nexpression was given to the people's admiration of Gordon's\r\ncharacter by the institution of the \"Gordon Boys' Home\" for homeless\r\nand destitute boys. Gordon's sister presented to the town of\r\nSouthampton her brother's library, in March, 1889.\r\n\r\nGordon's character was unique. Simple-minded, modest, and almost\r\nmorbidly retiring, he was fearless and outspoken when occasion\r\nrequired. Strong in will and prompt in action, with a naturally hot\r\ntemper, he was yet forgiving to a fault. Somewhat brusque in manner,\r\nhis disposition was singularly sympathetic and attractive, winning\r\nall hearts. Weakness and suffering at once enlisted his interest.\r\nCaring nothing for what was said of him, he was indifferent to\r\npraise or reward, and had a supreme contempt for money. His whole\r\nbeing was dominated by a Christian faith, at once so real and so\r\nearnest that, although his religious views were tinged with\r\nmysticism, the object of his life was the entire surrender of\r\nhimself to work out whatever he believed to be the will of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL GEORGE A. CUSTER[22]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 22: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy ELBRIDGE S. BROOKS\r\n\r\n(1839-1876)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General George A. Custer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDaring is always popular. The dashing fighter outranks the tactician\r\nand takes precedence over the engineer when the people's plaudits\r\nfor valor fill the air. To be the _beau sabreur_ of the army, as was\r\nMurat, in Napoleon's day, and as Custer was in Grant's, is as\r\nglorious as it is dramatic, as inspiring as it is picturesque. There\r\nwere, in fact, many points of resemblance between these two dashing\r\ncavalry leaders--Murat, the Frenchman, and Custer, the American.\r\nBoth smelled powder as the aides-de-camp of their chiefs; both rose\r\nrapidly from grade to grade, and from rank to rank, until they stood\r\nat the top; both labored at the end under the burden of criticism\r\nand detraction; and both met their death through a mistake, and fell\r\nlike brave and gallant soldiers.\r\n\r\nGeorge Armstrong Custer was born at New Rumley, in the State of\r\nOhio, on December 5, 1839. His father was a blacksmith and farmer,\r\nof German stock, a descendant of a Hessian officer named Küstu--one\r\namong many who came to conquer and remained to live and die as\r\ncitizens of the land they had failed to subjugate.\r\n\r\nYoung Custer was educated in the district school of New Rumley, and\r\nin the academy at Monroe, in Michigan, where he went in 1849 to live\r\nwith his sister Lydia. Returning to Ohio he taught school for a year\r\nor more in Hopedale, near New Rumley, and in 1857 was able to see\r\nhis boyish dream come true, and, as a lad of seventeen, enter the\r\nUnited States Military Academy at West Point.\r\n\r\nCadet Custer graduated from West Point in 1861, and hurried to the\r\nfront at once, eager for service, for the war between the States had\r\nbegun. He was made bearer of despatches by General Scott; he fought\r\nat Bull Run as lieutenant in the Second United States Cavalry, to\r\nwhich he had been assigned; he conducted successfully balloon\r\nreconnoissance along the Confederate lines, and so inspired General\r\nMcClellan by his energy, courage, and persistence that he was\r\nappointed aide-de-camp to the general, with the rank of captain.\r\n\r\nFor his dash and daring in the Rappahannock battles he was advanced\r\nby speedy promotions to the rank of brigadier-general of volunteers,\r\nhis commission dating from June, 1863, just one year after his\r\nappointment as aide-de-camp to McClellan. He won his brevet as major\r\nin the regular army for his brilliant leadership of cavalry at\r\nGettysburg; he had a horse shot under him while heading the charge\r\nat Culpepper, and gained his brevet as lieutenant-colonel of\r\nregulars for his gallantry in Sheridan's lights about Richmond, in\r\nthe spring of 1864. He won renown and glory in Sheridan's famous\r\nraid on Richmond, by saving his brigade-colors at the battle of\r\nTrevillion Station, and, in September, 1864, his dashing valor at\r\nWinchester procured him his brevet as colonel of regulars and the\r\nvolunteer rank of major-general. He won the battle of Woodstock by a\r\nwonderful cavalry engagement, routing the enemy, whom he drove for\r\ntwenty-six miles, and capturing all their guns save one. In the\r\nbloody battle of Cedar Creek he fought at the head of the Third\r\nDivision of Cavalry from start to finish, helping to turn a rout\r\ninto a victory and recapturing all the guns and colors the Union\r\ntroops had lost early in the action, besides taking all the\r\nConfederate flags and cannon. At Waynesboro, in the spring of 1865,\r\nstill leading the Third Division, he won the day unaided; he\r\ncaptured 1,600 prisoners, with all the enemy's camp equipage, guns,\r\nand colors, and then turning for another onset, Custer drove the\r\nConfederate General Early from the field, destroying his command,\r\nscattering his army, and ending the campaign, so far as Early's army\r\nwas concerned. For this brilliant engagement, and for his bravery at\r\nthe battles of Five Forks and Dinwiddie Court-House, on April 1,\r\n1865, Custer was brevetted brigadier-general in the regular army;\r\nand, as he had won the first colors taken by the Army of the Potomac\r\nin 1862, so, in 1865, he received the first flag of truce from Lee's\r\narmy when the end at last came, and was present at the historic\r\nsurrender at Appomattox. Then he secured his last promotion. He was\r\nbrevetted major-general in the regular army and appointed\r\nmajor-general of volunteers.\r\n\r\nIt was a brilliant and exceptional record. He had fought in all the\r\nbattles of the Army of the Potomac save one. He was Sheridan's most\r\ntrusted and favorite cavalry officer. In less than four years he had\r\nadvanced from captain of volunteers to major-general, and from\r\nlieutenant to major-general in the regular army. He was but\r\ntwenty-six when the war closed, and all his promotions had been won\r\nby his bravery, his dash, his daring, and his good leadership.\r\nDuring the last six months of the war the Third Division of Cavalry,\r\nled by Custer, captured in open fight over one hundred pieces of\r\nartillery, sixty-five battle flags, and ten thousand prisoners. It\r\nwas a record of which any soldier might be proud, and it made Custer\r\nat once the idol of his hard-riding troopers, and one of the popular\r\nheroes of the day. At the great review in Washington he rode near\r\nthe head of the parade, leading what was popularly called \"the most\r\ngallant cavalry division of the age,\" greeted with cheers and\r\nflowers along the line of march.\r\n\r\nCuster's active service did not close with the war. He was sent to\r\nTexas as commander of a cavalry division, and in November, 1865, was\r\nmade chief of cavalry. In February, 1866, he was mustered out of\r\nservice as major-general of volunteers and became again captain in\r\nthe regular army, \"on leave.\" President Johnson denied him the leave\r\nof absence he asked for to fight under Juarez in Mexico against\r\nMaximilian, the usurper, and in July, 1866, he received his\r\ncommission as lieutenant-colonel of the newly formed Seventh\r\nCavalry, United States Army--the regiment that he made into Indian\r\nfighters and served with until the end. In November, 1866, he joined\r\nhis regiment at Fort Riley, and was soon fighting Indians on the\r\nplains. He utterly defeated the hostile Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and\r\nKiowas at the battle of the Washita, in the Indian Territory, in\r\nNovember, 1871; he was on post duty in Kentucky until 1873, and then\r\nagain on the plains, where, on August 4, 1873, he whipped the\r\nhostile Sioux at the battle of Tongue River, in the Yellowstone\r\ncountry, and again, on the 11th of the same month, at the battle of\r\nthe Big Horn. In the summer of 1874 he led an expedition of\r\nexploration and discovery into the Black Hills, in the Dakota\r\ncountry, and in May, 1876, led his regiment in what proved to be his\r\nlast campaign, a march against the hostile Sioux in the unexplored\r\nregion of the Little Big Horn. Here, with less than three hundred\r\nmen, he faced the confederated Sioux, numbering thousands of\r\nwarriors, and in a desperate and characteristic engagement closed\r\nthe record of a life of brilliant effort and daring by standing at\r\nbay, against the tremendous odds of ten to one, until he and his\r\nentire command fell to a man, fighting desperately to the end.\r\n\r\nCuster was gallant, but sometimes indiscreet; he was daring, but\r\noften careless of consequences; and when in positions of command he\r\nwas apt to be impatient of cowardice and of greed. So he raised up\r\nenemies for himself, and twice these enemies sought and nearly\r\naccomplished his downfall. His last campaign was fought under the\r\nburden of an apparent official censure, galling to a man of Custer's\r\nimpetuous nature, all the more so as he knew it to be unmerited and\r\nunjust. There is little doubt that this weight of wrong engendered a\r\nspirit of recklessness, foreign even to his daring nature, and led\r\nhim to take risks he would not otherwise have accepted, simply\r\nbecause he felt the necessity for action and believed that through\r\nvalor would come his speediest vindication. Had he been supported by\r\nthose he relied upon he might, even in the face of the overpowering\r\nodds marshalled against him, have come off victorious, instead of\r\ndying, an unnecessary sacrifice, like another Roland, and, if we\r\naccept the legends, at just Roland's age. It is because that tragic\r\nending of a valiant life was, viewed from the picturesque\r\nstand-point, its logical and dramatic conclusion, that American\r\ntradition and popular applause will, in the years to come, remember\r\nCuster, not so much for the dash at Winchester, the daring at\r\nWaynesboro, or the valor at Five Forks, as for his immortal last\r\nstand on the banks of the Little Big Horn, when he and his brave\r\ntroopers went down in death together.\r\n\r\nGeneral Custer was the born soldier in face and figure. Lithe,\r\nbroad-shouldered, and sinewy in frame, nearly six feet in height,\r\nblue-eyed and golden-haired, he was the beau ideal cavalry\r\nleader--alert, active, ready, and responsive, with an eye to all\r\ndetails, a love for the picturesque in bearing and equipment, of\r\ngreat endurance, abstemious, healthy, and strong, and as much at\r\nhome in the saddle and with the sabre as in his own little house in\r\nMonroe or by his blazing camp-fire. He married, in February, 1864,\r\nElizabeth Bacon, a daughter of Judge Daniel S. Bacon, of Monroe. For\r\nten years his wife was his constant companion in camp and in\r\nfrontier service, and she has written many sketches of his active\r\nlife in the saddle and his characteristics as soldier and as man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Custer, at the time of his death, was engaged on a series of\r\n\"War Memoirs,\" and his articles on frontier life and army experiences\r\nfound ready acceptance and wide favor. He was, undoubtedly, America's\r\nbest cavalry leader, and won a place as \"a perfect general of horse\"\r\nbeside the world's dashing war-riders--from Hannibal's \"Thunderbolt,\"\r\nMago the Carthaginian, to Maurice of Nassau and the \"Golden Eagle,\"\r\nMurat the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nFourteen of the thirty-seven years he lived were spent in actual\r\nservice in the camp or on the battle-field. He was a brigadier-general\r\nat twenty-three and a major-general at twenty-five. In the height of\r\nhis popularity and his phenomenal success as a cavalry leader, he was\r\na picturesque and familiar figure to friend and foe alike, as in his\r\nbroad cavalier's hat, his gold-bedizened jacket, and high cavalry\r\nboots, with his long hair streaming in the wind, he would ride like a\r\ntornado, to the accompaniment of \"Garry Owen,\" his favorite\r\nbattle-air, carrying all before him--a subject worthy the pencil of a\r\nVandyke, the very type of the dashing trooper of romance. But that\r\nthere was a method in his dash and a practical element in his daring,\r\neven the generals he outranked and the civilians who tried to direct\r\nhim would admit, and to be the choice of McClellan and the favorite of\r\nSheridan gave the assurance of worth to his leadership and of value to\r\nhis valor.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Custer's remains were removed to the graveyard at West Point\r\nfrom the battle-field of the Little Big Horn, where he had first\r\nbeen buried amid the fallen heroes of his own brave band. In 1879\r\nthe Government made the battle-ground where Custer met his death a\r\nnational cemetery, and raised a monument, upon which appeared the\r\nnames and rank of all those who fell in that needless and fatal, but\r\nheroic, fight.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Elbridge S.

STANLEY[23]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 23: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess]\r\n\r\nBy NOAH BROOKS\r\n\r\n(Born 1841)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry M. Stanley.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo white men, one from America and the other from England, met in\r\nthe heart of Equatorial Africa, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika,\r\nNovember 10, 1871. This was their first meeting. The Englishman had\r\nbeen lost to the outside world for more than two years, and the\r\nAmerican had been looking for him since the early part of 1871.\r\nFinally, after many great difficulties and perils, the American\r\nfound the lost explorer, surrounded by his black guards, friends,\r\nand companions. They had dimly heard of each other through the vague\r\nrumors of the natives for months past, and now meeting face to face,\r\nthe American lifting his cap, said, \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume.\"\r\nThe Englishman nodded an affirmative reply, and the other said, \"I\r\nam Henry M. Stanley.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this simple yet dramatic way that two of the most famous\r\nAfrican travellers of modern times met in the heart of the Dark\r\nContinent. Quite as dramatic, perhaps, was the departure of Stanley\r\nin pursuit of Livingstone. Stanley was not widely known previous to\r\nhis expedition to Africa in search of Livingstone. He had served as\r\na war correspondent of one of the great New York newspapers for\r\nseveral years, and was known to his craft as a faithful, accurate,\r\nand courageous newspaper correspondent. He had dared many dangers,\r\nand had encountered and overcome obstacles that would have dismayed\r\na less intrepid soul. In 1868 he served the _New York Herald_ as\r\ncorrespondent during the war in Abyssinia which raged between the\r\nBritish and King Theodore. It was here he got his first taste of\r\nAfrican adventure. It was not a long war. The British shut up King\r\nTheodore in the fortress of Magdala, where he perished miserably by\r\nhis own hand in the flames of his burning citadel. Thence Stanley\r\nwent to Spain, where a great civil war had broken out, and he\r\nwitnessed the sacking of cities, the prosecution of sieges, and\r\nbattles large and small innumerable.\r\n\r\nThis war over, in the autumn of 1869, the civilized world was\r\nwondering whether Dr. Livingstone, the African missionary and\r\nexplorer, were dead or alive. Dr. Livingstone, who was of Scottish\r\nbirth and was in the service of the London Missionary Society, had\r\nbeen long laboring in South Africa, a country of which the outer\r\nworld then knew but very little. Along the coast here and there were\r\npoints occupied temporarily by white traders and travellers, but the\r\ninterior of the Dark Continent was known only through the tales of\r\nthe slave-catchers, who brought to the coast the black people they\r\nhad gathered like so many cattle in the interior. Dr. Livingstone\r\nwas doing what he could to spread the light of the Christian\r\nreligion through those benighted regions. His first departure into\r\nthe interior of Africa was from Cape Town, in 1840, and for more\r\nthan thirty-three years he spent his life in the arduous work to\r\nwhich he had consecrated himself. In 1858 he had returned to England\r\nand published a book, giving an account of his missionary labors and\r\nhis discoveries, and, liberally provided with means, he returned to\r\nAfrica to carry on his work. He was accompanied by his wife, who\r\ndied in the interior of Africa in 1862. In 1863 he returned to\r\nEngland and published a second book, giving some further account of\r\nhis explorations.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1865, he returned to Africa, and for more than a year no\r\nword came from him, but there ran a rumor that he had been killed by\r\nthe savages. Early in 1869, however, letters from Dr. Livingstone,\r\nwritten a year before, were received on the coast, showing that he\r\nwas alive and well. He had travelled many thousands of miles, being\r\nthe first white man that had ever penetrated those dark and\r\nmysterious regions in the heart of Africa. But now, in the autumn of\r\n1869, more than twenty months had passed since any word of his had\r\ncome out of the darkness, and the world was ready to believe that\r\nthe faithful missionary and explorer had dared his fate too often,\r\nand had died in the jungles of Africa.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Stanley, resting after a long and arduous\r\ncampaign in Spain, received from James Gordon Bennett, who was then\r\nin Paris, a telegram summoning him to an interview in that city.\r\nArriving at the French capital early in the morning, Stanley went\r\nstraight to Mr. Bennett's lodgings, before that gentleman had risen\r\nfrom his bed. In answer to his knock a voice commanded him to enter.\r\nThe two men had not met in many years. Stanley was bronzed and aged\r\nby sun and storm, and Bennett, surprised, abruptly asked, \"Who are\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Stanley, and I have come to answer your message,\" was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nBennett motioned Stanley to a seat, and after a moment's pause,\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Will you go to Africa and find Livingstone?\"\r\n\r\nStanley was startled. For a moment he reflected; then he replied, \"I\r\nwill;\" and before he left the room his agreement with Bennett was\r\npractically concluded, and some of the larger details of the\r\nexpedition were mapped out, and Stanley left the hotel clothed with\r\na commission to find Livingstone, and promised all needed funds for\r\nexpenses and for the relief of the great African explorer, should he\r\nbe in need, as it was expected he would be found, if at all.\r\n\r\nStanley first went to the east coast of Africa, where he arrived in\r\nthe early part of 1871. Months were consumed at Zanzibar in making\r\nready the expedition with which he was to penetrate into the\r\ninterior. Several caravans or trains were despatched, one after the\r\nother, loaded with ammunition, arms, provisions, and the necessaries\r\nof life, and with a large supply of goods with which to purchase a\r\nright of way through hostile or unfriendly kingdoms and states.\r\n\r\nBringing up the rear of these various trains, Stanley and his armed\r\nforce left the coast of Africa, March 21, 1871. He had with him 192\r\npersons, negroes and Arabs, and as he launched out into the\r\nuntravelled places of Africa, two words rang in his ears, \"Find\r\nLivingstone.\" Enduring many hardships, sometimes fighting and\r\nsometimes coaxing the natives, Stanley pressed on his way, his\r\ngeneral course being in a northwesterly direction, signs, rumors,\r\nand perhaps instincts, leading him to believe that Livingstone, if\r\nfound alive, would be discovered somewhere in the region of Lake\r\nTanganyika. It would be impossible to describe the vagueness and\r\nmysteriousness of the rumors which float to and fro in an\r\nuntravelled and savage country, but as the intrepid adventurer\r\npressed on he heard more and more credible reports of the lost white\r\nman. His first convincing intimation of his being near Livingstone\r\nwas when a black met him, and, speaking to him in tolerably good\r\nEnglish, told him that a white man was said to be in a village near\r\nby. This man was one of Dr. Livingstone's servants, and soon the\r\ntwo, one from America and the other from England, met at Ujiji, on\r\nthe shores of the lake.\r\n\r\nStanley remained with Livingstone until March 14th of the following\r\nyear, busied with explorations of the fascinating region into which\r\nhe had penetrated. He supplied Livingstone with all of the goods\r\nthat he could spare, and on his return to Zanzibar he sent him a\r\ncaravan with men, supplies, and such articles as he needed,\r\nfulfilling the orders of Mr. Bennett. Stanley never again saw\r\nLivingstone in life.\r\n\r\nLivingstone died of malarial fever contracted in the African\r\nmarshes, and his faithful blacks embalmed his body and carried it to\r\nthe coast, hundreds of miles, bringing with them every article\r\nbelonging to the faithful missionary, even to the smallest scraps of\r\npaper on which were penned the last notes of his journey which he\r\never wrote. Livingstone was buried with grand ceremony in\r\nWestminster Abbey, and Stanley was one of those who bore him to his\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nStanley's early life was a romance. He was born in Wales, near the\r\nlittle town of Denbigh, and his parents were so poor that when he\r\nwas about three years of age he was sent to the poor-house of St.\r\nAsaph to be brought up and educated at the expense of the parish. At\r\nthe age of thirteen he was his own master, and though young, he was\r\nambitious, well informed, and well poised. He taught school while\r\nyet a lad in the village of Mold, Flintshire, North Wales. Tiring\r\nof this uncongenial occupation, he made his way to Liverpool when he\r\nwas about fourteen years of age, and shipped as cabin-boy on board a\r\nsailing vessel bound to New Orleans. Like other British-born youths,\r\nAmerica was to him the promised land, and thither he turned his\r\nsteps in pursuit of fortune and fame. In New Orleans he fell in with\r\na kindly merchant, a Mr. Stanley, who adopted him and gave him his\r\nname, for the youngster's real name was John Rowlands. His protector\r\ndying without leaving a will, the boy was once more turned adrift,\r\nbut he managed to live and sustain himself, and when twenty-one\r\nyears of age, in 1861, the great Civil War having broken out,\r\nStanley went into the Confederate service then recruiting at New\r\nOrleans. He was subsequently taken prisoner by the Federal forces,\r\nand being allowed his liberty, he volunteered in the United States\r\nNavy. He did his work well, and was in due time promoted to be\r\nacting ensign on the iron-clad Ticonderoga. He made friends wherever\r\nhe went, for he was brave, modest, and of a frank disposition. The\r\nwar over he was discharged from the naval service, went to Asia\r\nMinor, where he saw many strange countries, wrote letters to the\r\nAmerican newspapers, and in 1866 revisited his native village in\r\nWales. Returning to the United States, he entered the service of the\r\n_New York Herald_, and went to Abyssinia as war correspondent, as\r\nbefore stated.\r\n\r\nStanley returned to Europe after his discovery of Livingstone, in\r\nJuly, 1872, and published his narrative, but many people in Europe\r\nand in America refused to believe his story. Some persons who\r\nthought themselves expert in knowledge of African travel proved to\r\ntheir entire satisfaction that he never had been far from the coast,\r\nnever had seen Livingstone, and that his wonderful tale was a tissue\r\nof romance. The Queen of England showed her belief and confidence in\r\nhim by sending him a box of gold set with jewels, and the Royal\r\nGeographical Society of Great Britain, a very high and mighty body,\r\nshowed him great honor.\r\n\r\nThe attention of geographers and scientific men was now turned to\r\nthe great Lake Tanganyika, about which very little was known. The\r\noutlet of the lake was as yet undiscovered. The secret sources of\r\nthe Nile were unknown, and the great river that reaches the Congo\r\ncoast from the interior was then, so far as men knew, lost in the\r\nfoam of the cataracts above. Even the already famous lake known as\r\nthe Victoria Nyanza was indistinctly sketched on the maps, and\r\npeople familiar with African exploration were uncertain whether that\r\ngreat body of water was a lake or a chain of lakes.\r\n\r\nStanley was asked by the editor of the _London Daily Telegraph_ if\r\nhe could settle these great questions if he were commissioned to go\r\nto Africa. He replied, \"While I live there will be something done.\r\nIf I survive the time required to perform all the work, all shall be\r\ndone.\" James Gordon Bennett was asked by cable if he would join in\r\nthe new expedition. His sententious reply flashed under the ocean\r\nwas: \"Yes. Bennett.\" And Stanley's second great work was already\r\ndetermined upon.\r\n\r\nOnly six weeks were allowed for preparation, and when it was noised\r\nabroad that Stanley was taking another expedition into the heart of\r\nAfrica, he was overwhelmed with offers of volunteer assistants, and\r\nwith a great variety of strange contrivances to help him on his\r\njourney. Finally, all preparations being concluded, he left England\r\nAugust 15, 1874, accompanied by only three white men, Frank and\r\nEdward Pocock and Frederick Barker. These men, with the goods and\r\nother needed articles for the expedition, were sent on ahead, and\r\ntwenty months after his last previous departure from Zanzibar,\r\nStanley was once more at that point of departure, ready to begin his\r\npreparations for another plunge into the heart of the Dark\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nSome of the black men who had been with him on his previous journey,\r\nwhen he searched for Livingstone, were found at Zanzibar, and they\r\nwere all eager to go with him again, and when he was ready to depart\r\nhe had in his company 224 persons, some of the black men taking\r\ntheir wives with them. The company after leaving Zanzibar landed at\r\nBergamoyo, on the mainland, November 13, 1874, and five days later\r\nhis column boldly advanced into the heart of the Dark Continent. The\r\ngeneral direction of the expedition was at first nearly westerly,\r\nthen turning to the north it was aimed for Victoria Nyanza. The\r\nmarch was obstructed by marshy regions, overflowing with recent\r\nrains. Moist exhalations and poisonous vapors prevailed, and the\r\nfirst month was a gloomy one. Stanley's own weight in thirty-eight\r\ndays fell from 180 pounds to 130 pounds, and the three young\r\nEnglishmen with him were greatly reduced in strength and flesh. One\r\nof these, Edward Pocock, was prostrated, and though he was carried\r\nback to the high, dry table land nearer the coast, he died and was\r\nburied in that lonely region.\r\n\r\nBy January 21, 1875, 20 of the black men of the expedition had died,\r\nmany were sick and disabled, and 89, discouraged by their\r\nmisfortunes, deserted. They were now in a hostile region, and were\r\nattacked by natives day after day in succession, but after much hard\r\nfighting they got away and labored onward toward the Victoria\r\nNyanza, which they reached on January 27th, near its southern shore.\r\nThis event was celebrated with great joy and cheerfulness; they felt\r\nthat they were out of the wilderness. Six weeks were now consumed in\r\na voyage around Victoria Nyanza.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the exploring party, Frederick Barker, who had\r\nbeen left in the camp on the lake, died of fever, leaving Pocock and\r\nStanley the only white men in the party. It was here that Stanley\r\nmet King Mtesa, the King of Uganda, a benevolent and mild-mannered\r\nPagan, who had previously been converted to Mohammedanism, and now\r\naccepted the Christian religion with equal cheerfulness and\r\ngood-nature.\r\n\r\nOn his way westward Stanley passed through the regions of King\r\nRumanika, an eccentric character, at whose court the white man heard\r\nmany strange stories of unknown regions in the heart of the\r\ncontinent. From this point Stanley went southwardly to explore that\r\npart of Lake Tanganyika which lies south, and this he found to be\r\nthree hundred and twenty miles long, averaging a width of\r\ntwenty-eight miles. It has no known outlet, and a sounding line of\r\ntwo hundred and eighty feet found no bottom.\r\n\r\nHis next march from Tanganyika to the River Lualaba was toilsome and\r\nperilous and beset with dangers almost incredible. At Nyangwe\r\nStanley touched the most distant point in Central Africa ever\r\nreached before by white man. Here he met with Tippoo Tib, the famous\r\nArab trader. This man, who has always seemed to be master of the\r\ndestinies and fortunes of the wild, roving tribes in the interior,\r\nagreed to accompany Stanley on his exploration of the Lualaba or\r\nGreat River. If it had not been for this agreement with Tippoo Tib,\r\nit is most likely that Stanley's expedition would have ended then\r\nand there, and we never should have known, as we now know, that the\r\nCongo and the Lualaba are one river, the second largest in the\r\nworld. Its line extends from its month on the west coast of Africa\r\nmore than half-way across the continent, and it has its rise in the\r\ngreat lakes of the interior. To this vast stream Stanley has given\r\nthe name of Livingstone.\r\n\r\nThe object of Stanley's journey now was to throw light on the\r\nwestern half of the continent, which was then represented on the\r\nmaps by a blank, through which meandered a few vague and uncertain\r\nlines representing rivers, guessed at but not known. Stanley got on\r\nbetter with the natives than did any of those who had gone before\r\nhim, for he was wise, patient, and gentle, and yet so firm and\r\ndecided that he was held in great awe and respect by the black men\r\nwherever he was known. Leaving the river and deflecting to the\r\nwestward, he struggled on through a forest matted and interlaced\r\nwith vines, swarming with creeping things, damp and reeking with\r\nvapors, and dripping with moisture. It was a most intolerable and\r\nhorrid stage of the journey. When again he struck the great river he\r\nresolved to go by land no further. Here he was abandoned by Tippoo\r\nTib, who refused to go on. Stanley resolutely set himself to work\r\nbuilding and buying canoes, and led by his own English-built boat,\r\nthe Lady Alice, his expedition started finally down the river, which\r\nhere flows due north. The fleet was twenty-three in number, and was\r\nloaded with stores, goods, and supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stanley shooting the Rapids of the Congo.]\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful voyage. The explorers were harassed at times by\r\nsavage tribes, some of them believed to be cannibals, who attacked\r\nthe strangers from shore, or in pure wantonness, as they drifted\r\ndown the stream. Sickness and hunger were often their lot, and they\r\nwere overtaken by tropical storms. In some places, too, they\r\nencountered rapids and cataracts, around which their fleet had to be\r\ndragged through paths cut in the primeval forest while the savages\r\nhovered around them. The forests were populous with wild beasts;\r\nchimpanzees and gorillas, monkeys, and all manner of four-footed\r\nthings infested the clambering vines that festooned the trees. They\r\nwere once attacked by an hippopotamus, and elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses were never far away. At a point below where the great\r\nriver turns from its great northerly course and flows westward, just\r\nabove the equator, was discovered a series of cataracts, seven in\r\nall, the first of which was named Livingstone Falls and the seventh\r\nStanley Falls. The natives from this point downward to the mouth of\r\nthe Congo had lost something of their natural ferocity, as they had\r\nbeen tamed by trade from the west coast, and great was the rejoicing\r\nof Stanley's Zanzibar men when they encountered native warriors with\r\nfirearms in their hands, for this showed that they had reached a\r\npeople supplied by traders from the Congo coast.\r\n\r\nThe passing of the last group of cataracts was attended by numerous\r\ndangers. In spite of all their efforts, canoes were sometimes\r\ncarried over the falls and wrecked, and on June 3d, Frank Pocock,\r\nthe last of Stanley's white companions, was drowned in the Congo by\r\nthe upsetting of a boat. Pocock was a brave, faithful, and devoted\r\nfollower of Stanley, who has paid a touching tribute to the\r\nmanliness, affection, and courage of the young Englishman who lies\r\nburied in the savage wilderness of the Congo.\r\n\r\nVery soon, as they drew nearer to the west coast, in the latter part\r\nof the summer of 1877, sickness, distress, and famine pressed hard\r\nupon the way-worn travellers. They were destitute of nearly\r\neverything that could sustain nature. The natives refused to sell\r\nsupplies, and starvation stared them in the face. Knowing that a\r\ntrading-post was established at Embomma, a two days' journey down\r\nthe river, Stanley wrote on an old piece of cotton cloth a letter\r\nasking for help, which was sent to the trading-post by his swiftest\r\nrunners. This letter was written in Spanish, French, and also in\r\nEnglish, Stanley in his anxiety and despair leaving no means untried\r\nto reach the unknown traders whom he heard were at Embomma. The men\r\ninto whose hands this three-fold message fell were English and\r\nPortuguese. Their response was prompt and generous. The messengers\r\nwere sent back, followed by a small caravan laden with ample\r\nsupplies of food and the necessaries of life, greatly to the relief\r\nof the starving people who, on the arrival of this timely aid, had\r\neaten nothing for thirty hours. On August 9, 1877, the nine hundred\r\nand ninety-ninth day from the date of their departure from Zanzibar,\r\nStanley's company, now numbering one hundred and fourteen blacks and\r\none white man, met the generous traders and merchants of Embomma,\r\nwho received the way-worn voyagers that had crossed the Dark\r\nContinent. From the mouth of the Congo the expedition was carried by\r\nsteamer to Kabinda, a seaport a short distance up the coast, whence\r\nthey were taken to the port of San Paolo de Loanda, where they\r\nembarked on board a British man-of-war and were taken to Cape Town;\r\nthence, touching at Port Natal, they steamed to Zanzibar, where they\r\narrived on November 20, 1877. Long since given up for dead, the\r\nZanzibar men were greeted by their kindred with signs of\r\nthanksgiving, tears and cries of joy. They had crossed the heart of\r\nthe continent, doubled the great Cape, and were again at home.\r\n\r\nStanley returned to England from Zanzibar, arriving in December,\r\n1877. The King of the Belgians had been planning an expedition to\r\nopen up the Congo country to trade, and now requested Stanley to\r\ntake command of his expedition. Stanley undertook the management of\r\nthe new organization and returned to Africa in 1879, where he\r\nremained nearly six years, hard at work on the Congo, making roads,\r\nestablishing stations, and opening the way for commerce. The Congo\r\nFree State, founded by King Leopold, lies chiefly south of the great\r\nbend of the river, and contains an area of 1,508,000 square miles,\r\nwith a population of more than 42,000,000. The articles collected\r\nfrom the African trade at points along the great river, are ivory,\r\npalm-oil, gum, copal, rubber, bees-wax, cabinet woods, hippopotamus\r\nteeth and hides, monkey skins, and divers other things. Stanley now\r\nmade brief visits to Europe and the United States. While he was in\r\nthis country, in the winter of 1886 and 1887, he was summoned back\r\nto Europe to take once more command of an African expedition to\r\nrescue Emin Pasha, governor of the province of Equatorial Africa.\r\nEmin is the Egyptian name of Dr. Schnitzler. He has been generally\r\nknown throughout Africa as Emin Pasha, and was governor of the\r\nprovince which is one of the outlying posts of the Egyptian\r\ngovernment, when the revolt in the Soudan took place. When General\r\nGordon was besieged in Khartoum, the province of Emin Pasha was cut\r\noff from the rest of Egypt, and Emin was shut up in the region north\r\nof the Albert Nyanza, whose capital is Lado, on one of the minor\r\nbranches of the White Nile.\r\n\r\nTo relieve him in his isolation and necessity, a subscription was\r\nstarted in England, and once more, equipped with men, arms,\r\nammunition, and other supplies, Stanley sailed for Africa in\r\nJanuary, 1887, making his head-quarters as before at Zanzibar. The\r\nsupplies for the expedition were shipped directly to the Congo and\r\ncarried up stream by steamers. At Zanzibar, Stanley's old friend\r\nTippoo Tib was met, and he signed an agreement making him Governor\r\nof Stanley Falls to defend that post against all comers, a salary\r\nbeing guaranteed him. Then, accompanied by Tippoo Tib, Stanley went\r\nto the mouth of the Congo by the way of the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nreaching the river March 18, 1887; then, ascending the stream on\r\nwhich he had met so many hardships and endured so much suffering, he\r\ncarried his force of nearly one thousand men, and his supplies,\r\narms, and ammunition, to the relief of Emin Pasha, an enormous\r\nquantity altogether. The white companions of Stanley on this\r\nexpedition were Major Barttelot, who had served with distinction\r\nunder General Wolseley in Egypt, Major Sir Andrew Clarke, Lieutenant\r\nStairs, Captain Nelson, Dr. Park, Rose Troup, Mountjoy Jephson,\r\nWilliam Bonny, and Mr. Jameson. Of these, two returned to England\r\nbefore the termination of the journey, and three perished during the\r\nwanderings of the expedition through forty-five hundred miles of\r\ntrackless wilderness, pestilential marshes, and regions populous\r\nwith hostile savages. From June, 1887, to December, 1889, the party\r\nwas lost to the world and no definite news from it reached\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe expedition, which had been divided into two parts, generally\r\npursued its way in a northeastward course. Major Barttelot was left\r\non the Aruwimi, at Yambuya, with 257 men and the main part of the\r\nstores, to await the coming of the promised reinforcements from\r\nTippoo Tib. A long delay ensued, and troubles broke out in\r\nconsequence (it is said) of the rash and imperious demeanor of Major\r\nBarttelot, and finally Barttelot was murdered and the entire\r\nrear-guard was broken down by desertion and pillage. Jameson\r\ncollected the remains of the party, but he soon after died, and Mr.\r\nBonny succeeded to the command and collected and kept the men\r\ntogether. Meanwhile, Stanley's march ahead was made with many\r\ndifficulties, and he encountered rapid streams and other obstacles\r\nunforeseen and unexpected. Toward the end of December, 1887,\r\nStanley's expedition having reached the Albert Edward Nyanza, and\r\nstill being unable to open communications with Emin Pasha, it was\r\ndecided to return to the forest and build a fort, and, after resting\r\nthe forces, make a new start toward the lake. This fortification,\r\nknown as Fort Bodo, was inhabited until April, 1888, when Stanley\r\npressed on, and finally found Emin Pasha and his companion, Dr.\r\nCasati. They had passed through the country of the dwarfs, nearly\r\nperishing with hunger, and when they reached the lake, Emin's\r\nsoldiers had mutinied and he was a prisoner. Emissaries from the\r\nMahdist Dervishes had stirred up the camp of Emin and caused\r\ninextricable confusion. Emin was reluctant to leave the province,\r\nand when Stanley and his white companions determined to attempt to\r\nreach Zanzibar by an unexplored route, Emin refused to depart. Four\r\nmonths were spent in an effort to overcome the reluctance of Emin\r\nPasha and Captain Casati, who were unwilling to leave their people.\r\n\r\nEmin's plea was that ten thousand of his people would have to be\r\nextricated from the province and carried to the coast. After many\r\nand exasperating discussions, Stanley refused to wait longer, and\r\nEmin, who had become nearly blind, brought away with him about five\r\nhundred persons. The expedition then, over a southeasterly route,\r\nmade its way toward the coast.\r\n\r\nThe course of march from Albert Edward Nyanza was nearly in a direct\r\nline to the Uzinja country, on the southwest shore of the Victoria\r\nNyanza. The party passed south of Victoria Lake and reached the east\r\ncoast December 4, 1889. The caravan, since it left Albert Edward\r\nNyanza, had dwindled from fifteen hundred to one-half that number.\r\nThis latest journey of Stanley lasted one thousand and twelve days,\r\nof which hardly twenty were without tragical and perilous incidents.\r\nThe story of the annihilation that overcame his rear-guard has been\r\noften told. It will probably never be settled exactly where shall be\r\nplaced the blame for that frightful disaster.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the Emin relief expedition, Stanley revisited the\r\nUnited States, accompanied by his bride whom he had lately married.\r\nHe gave lectures in several of the larger cities of the country on\r\nhis surprising adventures in Africa. He was now prematurely aged by\r\nhis terrible experiences, and though his eye was still bright and\r\nhis frame alert, care and privation had whitened his hair, exposure\r\nhad darkened his skin and left its wrinkled impress on his forehead.\r\nEverywhere he was received with the greatest enthusiasm and followed\r\nby eager thousands, who gazed upon his face and hung with rapture on\r\nhis words. In 1892 he returned to England, and availing himself of\r\nhis British nationality, stood for Parliament in the District of\r\nLambeth, City of London, as a Conservative candidate. Much to the\r\nsurprise and grief of his friends he was defeated and since then he\r\nhas remained in private life.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Noah Brooks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ALVA EDISON[24]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 24: Copyright, 1894, by Selmar Hess.]\r\n\r\nBy CLARENCE COOK\r\n\r\n(Born 1847)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas Alva Edison.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs someone has called Leonardo da Vinci \"the great Italian Yankee,\"\r\nbecause of his multifarious and ingenious suggestions in the world\r\nof material things, so our own Edison may be called \"the Yankee\r\nLeonardo,\" for, with a curiosity ranging over the whole world of\r\nnature, equal to that of the Italian, and with a fecundity of\r\ninvention no less bewildering, he unites, like Leonardo, an\r\nimaginative and poetical vein that lifts his devices into the domain\r\nof Art.\r\n\r\nYet Edison is in no respect a graceful or romantic figure such as\r\nLeonardo was. He reminds us rather, by the weird and cosmic nature\r\nof his speculations and inventions, of some one of the beings\r\ncreated by the Norse mythologists: a nineteenth century gnome,\r\nrough, shaggy, uncouth, wholly absorbed in his search among the\r\nsecrets of nature, and, while working always for the good of\r\nmankind, dwelling in a world apart, and with neither time nor\r\ninclination to mix in human affairs.\r\n\r\nThomas Alva Edison was born at Milan, Erie County, O., February 11,\r\n1847. He started in life hampered by poverty, by want of teaching\r\nand training, without friends outside his own home circle to\r\nencourage him in pushing his fortunes, and with small opportunity,\r\nin the little village where his lot had been cast, for bettering his\r\ncondition. On his father's side he came of sturdy Dutch stock: the\r\nold man, who was still living in 1879 at the age of seventy-four,\r\nreckoned among his immediate ancestors one who lived to be one\r\nhundred and two years old, and another who reached one hundred and\r\nthree. He would appear to have been, like pioneers in general,\r\nready, if not obliged, to turn his hand to any employment that might\r\nyield a living, that must be scanty at the best; and we read of him\r\nas in turn a tailor, a nurseryman, a dealer, first in grain and then\r\nin lumber, and an agent for the sale of farm-lands. He seems to have\r\nbeen unable to do much for his boy beyond teaching him to read and\r\nwrite, stimulating his taste for reading by paying him small sums of\r\nmoney for every book he read through; he had no need to insist that\r\nthe reading should be done thoroughly, for it was the boy's way to\r\ndo thoroughly everything he undertook. His mother, also, helped\r\nThomas in learning: she was of Scotch extraction; but, though her\r\nparents were from the old country, she herself was born in\r\nMassachusetts, where for a time she had been a school-teacher. This,\r\nthen, with the exception of two months at the village school, was\r\nthe limit of young Edison's education--to use the conventional\r\nterm. The world was now to take him in hand, and show what it could\r\ndo with material so unpromising.\r\n\r\nBefore he was twelve years old, the boy had found a place as newsboy\r\non the Grand Trunk Line running to Detroit. In the intervals between\r\nhis raids upon the helpless passengers with his newspapers,\r\nperiodicals, novels, and candies, he kept up the habit of reading,\r\nand by practice acquired a remarkably clear and finished\r\nhandwriting. His next step was to secure the sole right of selling\r\nnewspapers on the train, and he soon had four boys under him to\r\nassist him in the work. Having then bought a lot of old type from\r\nsome printing-office, he rigged up a rude frame in one of the\r\nbaggage-cars that served as a lumber-room, and then proceeded to set\r\nup and print a newspaper which he called the _Grand Trunk Herald_,\r\nand sold with the other newspapers. As he had no press, he was\r\nobliged to take off the impressions by rubbing the paper on the\r\ninked type with his hands. In some way, a copy of this newspaper\r\nfound its way to the _London Times_, and the editor spoke of it as\r\nthe only newspaper in the world printed on a moving train. During\r\nthe fighting at Pittsburgh Landing in 1862, Edison printed off\r\nabstracts of the telegraphic news, and posted them up at the small\r\ncountry stations, thus rendering a great service to the people\r\nanxiously waiting for news from the field. The terminus of his train\r\nwas Detroit, and here, for the first time, he had access to a\r\nlibrary. In his enthusiasm at finding himself in virtual possession\r\nof such a treasure, he determined, then and there, to read the whole\r\nlibrary through, as it stood, using his time between trains.\r\nBeginning at one shelf he read fifteen feet in a line, going through\r\neach book solidly from cover to cover. In this first bout, among\r\nother books, he read Newton's \"Principia,\" Ure's \"Scientific\r\nDictionary,\" and Burton's \"Anatomy of Melancholy.\"\r\n\r\nAll this time, by hints and suggestions, Nature had been pushing the\r\nyouth toward the field he was finally to occupy almost by right of\r\neminent domain. As yet, telegraphy was in its infancy, and the\r\npowers of electricity only beginning to be known. Edison had from\r\nthe first been interested in the workings of the telegraph line\r\nalong the railroad, and had made some experiments with a rude line\r\nof his own, connecting his father's home at Port Huron--a village to\r\nwhich the family had some time before removed from Milan--with the\r\nhouse of a neighbor. To do this, he had to make a battery out of\r\nodds and ends, old bottles, stove-pipe wire, and nails made out of\r\nzinc contributed by his youthful friends, who in their zeal cut\r\npieces out of the zinc mats under their mothers' stoves. He had no\r\none to teach him telegraphy, but an accident--if accidents there\r\nbe--was unexpectedly to put him in the way of learning its secrets.\r\nThe child of the station-master was in danger from a moving train;\r\nyoung Edison snatched it up and saved its life at the risk of his\r\nown, and the grateful father rewarded him by teaching him what he\r\nknew of telegraphy.\r\n\r\nArmed with this rudimentary knowledge, and with what, in addition, he\r\nhad learned by practice, Edison passed the next few years of his life\r\nin moving about over the country, seeking employment less, it would\r\nappear, for the sake of employment than for the opportunity of\r\nincreasing his practical knowledge of the art that was to swallow up,\r\nin his mind, all the other arts. But he seems to have succeeded almost\r\nin spite of himself. He was so eager in his chase after knowledge that\r\nhe was continually tripping himself up. While still at his trade of\r\nnewsboy on the Grand Trunk Railroad, he had come across, at Detroit\r\nprobably, a copy of Fresenius' \"Qualitative Analysis\" and had become\r\nso much interested in chemistry, that alongside his printing-press he\r\nhad fitted up a small laboratory with a chance-medley apparatus for\r\nexperiments, and one day a bottle of phosphorus was upset, and the car\r\ntaking fire was only saved by the energy of the conductor, who\r\npromptly pitched the whole apparatus, with the printing-press to boot,\r\nout at the door, and then gave the young Fresenius-Franklin a\r\nthrashing. Later we hear of him, in the course of his wanderings, set\r\nto watch a telegraph-machine in the absence of the operator, and to\r\nprove that he was on guard he was to send the word six over the line\r\nevery half-hour. Not to be interrupted in the book he was reading, he\r\ncontrived a device that did the work automatically. In another office\r\nhe kept back messages while he was contriving a way to send them more\r\nquickly! Disappearing from this office, he appears again in another,\r\nthis time in Memphis, Tenn. But his interest in solving the problem of\r\nduplicate transmission proved so absorbing that he continually\r\nneglected his duties, and on the occasion of a change of officers he\r\nwas dismissed as a useless member of the staff. At Louisville he\r\nupsets a carboy of sulphuric acid which ruins the handsome furniture\r\nof a broker's office on the floor below, and again finds himself\r\nadrift in an unappreciative world. Yet he had proved himself, in spite\r\nof all drawbacks, an adept of uncommon skill in telegraphy; and so\r\nwidespread in scientific circles was his reputation, that he was sent\r\nfor to Boston to take charge of the main New York wire. The impression\r\nmade by the records of his life at this time is, that he looked upon\r\nall these employments merely as so many opportunities for earning his\r\nbread while pursuing his beloved experiments, and that the\r\nbread-earning was the least important part of the affair. No doubt, he\r\nalways meant to do his duty, but the ecstasy of invention and the\r\nthirst for discovery carried him out of himself and made him often\r\noblivious of sublunary things. While in Boston he still kept up his\r\nexperiments and perfected his duplex telegraph, but it was not brought\r\ninto successful operation until 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 he came to New York, and having attracted the attention of\r\nthe Stock Exchange by some ingenious suggestions put forth while\r\nbusied in repairing the machine that recorded quotations, he was\r\nmade Superintendent of the Gold and Stock Company, and brought out\r\nhis invention of the printing-telegraph, by which the fluctuations\r\nof the stock-market in any part of the country are instantly\r\nrecorded on narrow strips of paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas A. Edison--The Wizard of Menlo Park.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate success of this invention, and the great demand for\r\nthe machines, led him to establish a workshop for their manufacture\r\nin Newark, N. J. But soon the need of still more space, and the\r\ndesire for freedom from interruption while at his work, obliged him\r\nto give up Newark, and he found new quarters at Menlo Park, N. J.--a\r\nbare plot of barren acres destitute of natural attraction of any\r\nkind, unless it be--what to Edison indeed is a great charm--an\r\nuninterrupted view of the sky; a place virtually unknown before he\r\nplanted there the rude buildings that house his wonderful\r\ninventions; yet now a place known to scientific men all over the\r\nworld; the Mecca of many a mind seeking to wrest from Nature her\r\ndearest secrets.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, many of the inventions that have made Edison famous must\r\nbe ascribed in their conception and ripening' to various periods of\r\nhis life, but to the popular mind they are all associated with the\r\nwizard's present home, from whence for several years the bulletins\r\nof inventions--playful, useful, necessary, revolutionary--often as\r\nsimple in their mechanism as they are astonishing in their results,\r\nhave been given to a delighted world. Some of Edison's inventions\r\nhave a character at present of little more than picturesque\r\nplayfulness, such as the Phonograph, perhaps the most remarkable of\r\nthese minor inventions; the Aerophone, by which sounds are amplified\r\nwithout loss of distinctness; the Megaphone, an instrument which,\r\ninserted in the ear, so magnifies sounds that faint whispers may be\r\nheard a thousand feet; the Phonometer, for measuring the force of\r\nthe soundwaves caused by the human voice; the Microtasimeter, for\r\nmeasuring small variations in temperature. This has been tested for\r\nso small a variation as 1/24000 of a degree Fahrenheit, and in 1878\r\nwas used to detect the presence of heat in the sun's corona. The\r\nmost familiar of these lesser inventions is the Phonograph by which\r\nsounds are made self-recording and capable of being repeated. While\r\nthis curious invention--almost childish in its simplicity--is as yet\r\nlittle more than a plaything, and has proved of small utility, it\r\nmakes, nevertheless, a strong appeal to the imagination when we\r\nreflect that by its aid the voice of any human being may be\r\ntransmitted to ages far in the future, and its living tones be heard\r\nlong after he who uttered them has returned to the dust.\r\n\r\nBut, while these inventions have the charm that invests \"the\r\nfairy-tales of science,\" the world-wide fame of Edison rests upon\r\ngreater gifts to the world; the various improvements he has made in\r\nthe telegraph, and the perfection to which he has brought the\r\nelectric light. The invention of the telephone, by which persons are\r\nenabled to converse with one another at very long distances, and by\r\nwhich concerts, operas, and orations or sermons in one city can be\r\nheard by an audience assembled in another, is one of the most\r\nremarkable of Edison's achievements, and one the usefulness of which\r\nin various directions it is easy to foresee. The idea of the\r\ntransmission of messages in opposite directions by the same wire was\r\none that had early occurred to Edison, but he was long in reducing\r\nit to practice. The secret once discovered, however, he rapidly\r\nprogressed until he had brought out the sextuple telegraph, where we\r\nbelieve the ability of the instrument rests at present.\r\n\r\nThe inventor next turned his mind to the study of the electric lamp,\r\nin which he saw great possibilities. He believed that he could\r\nproduce a light that should be cheaper than gas, and also purer,\r\nmore steady, and more to be depended on. He rejected the principle\r\nof the Voltaic arc involved in the Brush patent then in use, by\r\nwhich the electric current was passed through a strip of platinum or\r\nother metal that requires a high temperature to melt, because in\r\npractice it was found that in fact, owing to the difficulty of\r\nregulating the flow of the electric current, the medium did often\r\nmelt. He therefore sought for a medium that should be practically\r\nindestructible, and believed that it would be found in pure carbon\r\nenclosed in a vacuum. After many trials with one and another\r\nsubstance, he at length found that by employing slender strips of\r\ncard-board reduced by intense heat to carbon, connecting them with\r\nthe wires leading from the machine, and enclosing them in glass\r\nbulbs from which the air had been extracted, the desired result\r\ncould be produced. The next step to accomplish was the division of\r\nthe light, so that any number of lamps could be supplied by the same\r\npair of wires--a condition absolutely necessary if the invention\r\nwere to be of practical utility as applied to the lighting of\r\nfactories, public buildings, or private households, where-ever, in\r\nshort, many lights are needed. This was finally accomplished, and in\r\nDecember, 1879, an exhibition was given at Menlo Park of a complete\r\nsystem of lighting. This first demonstration of the possibility of\r\nlight-division created a great interest in scientific circles all\r\nover the world, especially as scientific experts had testified\r\nbefore the British House of Commons that the feat was impossible.\r\nThe Edison incandescent burner is now in use in every city, town,\r\nand hamlet in this country, and it would seem as if it must of\r\nnecessity before long drive the costly, unhealthy, and dangerous\r\ncoal-gas out of use for illuminating purposes, although we believe a\r\nwide field of usefulness lies before the coal-gas as a substitute\r\nfor coal in our kitchens.\r\n\r\nThomas Edison has received few public honors from his countrymen;\r\nbut the nature of his work has been such as to make his name a\r\nhousehold word throughout his native country; and not only by the\r\nadmiration excited by his genius--for it deserves no less a\r\nname--but by the practical, every-day benefits he has conferred, he\r\nhas earned a place in the good-will and esteem of his fellows such\r\nas seldom falls to the lot of man.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Clarence Cook.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Great Men and Famous Women.
